This looks great. What do you think? Maybe another eighth of an inch on the pant? Morning. Morning. The impossible-to-get crepe wool from Italy is on its way. Wow! Really? Only the best business partner could have pulled that off - right before Christmas. - You are the best, Dhruvi, but don't tell me you're on Connection Link again. How else am I supposed to stalk people from high school? No. I was checking our Rachel Rocca page until you got here. - But now... - Oh. We need to go get coffee. I can't. I need to do... Wait. What is that? Keep your coat on. And come with me. Are you ready for this? This is the most dramatic coffee run I've ever been on. "The editor of Premiere Fashion magazine..." - Sybil Neale? - "... Invites you to donate your time and considerable talent to the annual NYC Christmas Gala." - Wait. Let me see that! - Ah, ah! "Each participating menswear designer will be asked to create a look for the Gala's first-ever Christmas Runway Contest and Bachelor Auction, with all proceeds going to support NYC Foster." This is it! This is the break we've been waiting for! The CEO of Blaines Park Avenue is Sybil's close friend, so he'll be at the Gala. When you win the contest, he'll have to agree to see the pitch for our new line. No. Your tuxedo will be the pitch. Yeah. No pressure. But I think you're right. I think this is how we get his attention. And don't forget what he said. He considers Blaines to be high end but accessible. When you win this Runway Contest, you're going to prove that you can design for anybody. It says here that all the bachelors will be photographed for a spread in Premiere Fashion magazine, but the winning designer's look will be featured on the cover! Any idea who else got an invite? I mean, it's Sybil Neale, so I'm sure all the big names are begging to compete. The whole industry's taken a big hit the last couple years. The fact that I even got invited... Uh, your name should be considered with the best. Time to remind people that you are the creative genius that puts men in bold colors. Look at you. Unknown Rachel Rocca, who went to the Milwaukee Fashion Institute, has worked her way up to competing with the big dogs. Milwaukee... My parents! They're coming for Christmas! I'm sure they'll understand how important this is. Yeah, well, understanding my life can be a challenge for them. You know, it's funny. Their parents are from Bolivia, but they act like New York is a foreign country. Okay. I'll put together some places they can sightsee. In the meantime, get your sketch pad. The Gala is in three weeks. Oh, and... you need to be at the Beckham Square Hotel at 10 AM tomorrow to meet your bachelor. Oh. Whatever man I get is key. Yes, but don't worry if you get some octogenarian mogul. When you're through with him, every woman at the auction will be eager to bid. Well I love Santa Claus And all of his reindeer Swinging round the world Spreading Christmas cheer On the roof he's up and the chimneys down Leaving presents all around So look out No. That outfit is a strange choice. First impressions are critical. - I beg your pardon. - Just put on a clean collared shirt, and you'll be fine. Talk soon. I'm sorry. Did you say something? Yes. No. I just... It's embarrassing, but I thought you were talking to me just then. Well, is your shirt not clean? Of course it is. I just... Never mind. I was, uh, talking to a kid I mentor. He wants to include his photograph with his college applications. Oh! I think that's a great idea. Mm, but he wants to spend his hard-earned money on some overpriced, crazy clown suit for the photo. I mean, he insists it's high fashion just because some outlandish designer - has her label on it. - What designer? A Rachel... something. Rocca? Rachel Rocca? That's the one. Yeah. Not for anything, but... men... should just wear classic black. Well, some men aren't hindered by archaic male stereotypes. - Hindered? - Restricted. Restrained. Inhibited. Yes. I know the definition. Uh, despite my desire to pursue the fascinating direction this conversation is taking, I, um, am hindered by my need to be on time for my next appointment. Excuse me. Honestly, Rachel, I just loved it. Saw it in your 2019 show. I still have some of that fabric. - Do you want some, Atticus? - Really? I'd love it. I'll trade you for some fabulous Vicuna wool I found. Ooh, yeah. Woman: Thank you for coming. I know you're as busy as I am. As you all know, this ballroom will soon host the annual New York Christmas Gala and Bachelor Auction. I bid on a man here in 2009. Yes. I attended your wedding in 2010. Our gala is known for the charities it supports. So, this year, we've added an extra element: the Christmas Runway Contest. I've invited you, the best of the best, to design tuxedos for this year's bachelors, with all the proceeds going to foster programs throughout the city. I know you're all excited to get started designing, so I've brought you here to meet your bachelors. Now, did you all get a colorful candy cane when you entered? We've randomly given each of our eligible bachelors a candy cane as well. So, let's see who matches who. Julia? Blue. Great. I got a Smurf. Thank you, gentlemen, for participating in such a worthy cause. Now, please reveal the color of your candy cane. Oh, no. I'll leave it to you all from here to collaborate, and thank you again for supporting the Gala. Rachel: Hi. I'm outlandish designer Rachel Rocca. Brett Stone. Archaic male stereotype. Rachel: "Disaster" doesn't even begin to describe it. It was a calamity. Debacle. Catastrophe. You're exaggerating. I wish I was. Well, he certainly keeps a low profile. I'm searching for a recent photo of him right now. Yeah. He's, well, not exactly an octogenarian. Dhruvi: Um, Brett Stone could stop traffic. And the creator of Connection Link? He must be a kazillion-aire! Yeah. None of that matters. He made it very clear he only wears black. How in the world am I supposed to put my signature on the design using all black? I got to go, Dhruvi. - Woman: Hola! - Rachel: Talk tomorrow. - Hey! - Hola, cariño! Feliz Navidad! Here, let me help you. Oh, there's more on the sidewalk. Okay. Dónde está tu árbol de Navidad? I haven't had time to get a Christmas tree yet, Mama. I will. I wish you guys had let me pick you up from the airport. I have been a taxi driver in Milwaukee for 35 years. This gave me a chance to tip a brother in arms before Christmas. Where are the angels I made you? Still packed away? Honestly, I've been a little behind on Christmas this year. I'm designing for a charity event. Oh, charity at Christmas. Good for you. Well, yeah, it would be, except I got paired with the most obstinate, - narrow-minded... - Who? Nobody you know. His name is Brett Stone. The creator of Connection Link? I love Connection Link! You have a Connection Link account? Yeah. I like to keep up to date with all the cousins in Bolivia. Oh, look. Here's Evy's new sofa with all her grandbabies on it. Tomas: And I belong to a Fishermen of Lake Michigan group. We post photos of all our best catches there. Well, I'll be able to give you guys the inside scoop. I'm visiting Connection Link headquarters tomorrow. Now, that I'd love to see. I could make some calls, see if you can come with me. It won't be for long. I just have to get the obstinate man's measurements. - Cafecito? - Sí! - I'll put the kettle on. - Gracias. Connection Link... Rach, it says here they have employee nap rooms and ping pong. Colorful, fun, inviting. The exact opposite of Brett Stone. Uh, we collect gifts for kids throughout the city. Brett is very intentional about this work. Many of our fostered teenagers have afterschool jobs here. Some even go to work with us full time. - Really? - Yes. I am, uh, Sloan Avery, - Brett's assistant. - Nice to meet you, Sloan. I'm Rachel Rocca. These are my parents, Marciela and Tomas. - Hi. - It's a pleasure to meet you. - Brett said it was okay if I... - Oh, yes, absolutely. We are so glad that you're all here, but I must tell you that Brett is caught on an international call. - Oh. - Sloan: He won't be too long. In the meantime, may I invite you to participate in our gingerbread decorating class? François Moreau is teaching it. The Michelin star chef? I love gingerbread houses! Unfortunately, we don't really have a whole lot of ti... Sure. Yeah. Sounds great. Sloan: Great. Just this way. Thank you. Well, I'm eager to see what the outlandish designer can do with gingerbread. This is what Christmas looks like in all black. It could use some color, don't you think? Mr. Stone, thank you for hosting us. Tomas Rocca. My wife, Marci. Welcome. Welcome. Rachel, what have you done to your gingerbread house? Well, Mama, Brett and I seem to be in a quandary over his tuxedo design. Quandary? Dilemma. Impasse. Predicament. I know what "quandary" means. Brett seems to think, for the Christmas Runway show, his tuxedo should be in all black. I think he should step out of his comfort zone, try some color. I always wear black. Thus the term "comfort zone." Well, I can see Brett's point. Black is strong, classic. Fernando Colunga wore all black when he accepted his telenovela award. You hear that? Fernando Colunga... whoever that is. But I see where Rachel's coming from, too. May you should try something different, surprise yourself... and us. Let's take a vote. All in favor of black? Okay. Brett and my own mutinous mother. Color? Oh, oh, no, no, no, no, no. I'm a cab driver. Far too smart to get in the middle of this traffic jam. I'm not changing my mind. Then you'd better change your bachelor. Rachel: Black. Black. And more black! I think he must be the Ghost of Christmas Future. That would make you Scrooge, and the Roccas are not Scrooges. And I even forgot to get his measurements. Who flies a French pastry chef in to teach their employees gingerbread decorating? Listen to this. "Brett Stone is intensely private, refuses interviews, and his history before Connection Link is widely unknown." Ooh. Have to love a handsome, mysterious man. It's the stuff of telenovela! Mama... don't get any ideas. No ideas. But whatever happened to... What was his name? - Uh, Justin. Uh, Jeremy. - Marci: Mm. I told you. We just weren't a good fit. - Marci: Back in Bolivia... - I know how they do things - in Bolivia, Mama. - She's a Milwaukee girl, Marci. Rachel: No, that's not it, either. I just... - What's wrong with Milwaukee? - We just want you to be happy. As we are. I got to go to work. I'm going to call Atticus and see if he'll switch bachelors with me. Oh, don't do that. Brett invited your mother to the Connection Link Christmas tree lighting tonight. I think that invitation was for all of us. But he said I was his favorite Rocca. Well, it's clearly not me. Besides, if Atticus agrees, I'll have the pleasure of telling Brett that our short but tumultuous relationship is thankfully over. I see you Googled Rachel Rocca. Look. She can't possibly expect me to wear one of those suits. I mean, they're so... bright. I might blind someone. I saw your face. What face? Yesterday, when you first saw her, there was a face. Don't give me the Brett heart of stone look. You forget. I knew you before you were all famous and intimidating. You know, we've come a long way, haven't we, Sloan? In some ways, yes. Who would have believed it? - But... - Just say what's on your mind. You always do. I know that getting... invested in other people is hard for us. Probably because of all the disappointment - we suffered as kids. - Well, I see you're taking advantage of the employee counselors Connection Link provides. Maybe get to know Rachel. You remember how much I struggled when I first met Luke. I had to let some walls down. You helped. Now, look at me. Look. If I were even inclined to get involved... What's up, big man? You have to knock, DeMario. What if every employee just came barging in here? Oh, sorry. I just wanted to talk about my college apps. Why don't you give it a try? It's a good practice so you don't just walk into other people's dorm rooms next year. Alright. Just so you know, if I become a psychologist like I plan to, you are welcome to barge into my office at any time. - Sloan, Brett: Mm. - Well, preferably when I'm not - with a patient. - Ah. So, how's it going, having DeMario living with you and Luke? - It's going great. - Yeah? I mean, every kid needs a home, right? Hello? Mr. Stone? It is I, DeMario Truitt, your finest part-time employee, seeking permission to enter the inner sanctum. Get in here, you goof! Let's finish those applications. Oh. I still need a suit for my pictures. Oh, you know what, DeMario? I think Brett knows just the woman to help with that. Dhruvi: Absolutely not. I am not letting you - switch bachelors with Atticus. - Dhruvi... Uh, let's review. We are trying to get the attention of the CEO of Blaines Park Avenue. Which bachelor would garner the most attention? - Brett Stone. - Yep, and which bachelor is the mysterious man behind Connection Link, a man the entire universe is curious about? - Brett Stone. - Mm-hmm, and which bachelor is so handsome you could put a paper bag over his head and every woman at the auction would still bid? - A paper bag? - Look. Brett Stone is like a Christmas gift that has fallen from the sky right into our laps. - A gift? - You need to do whatever it takes to convince him. "Gift" might be the wrong word. This man's entire wardrobe is monochromatic, and I have to convince him to wear something dazzling. Dazzling. You talking about me? - Oh. - I, uh, would have knocked, but the studio doors are wide open. As a matter of fact, I was not talking about you. You're rather muted, actually. - Brett: Muted? - Obscure. Dark. Gloomy. I know what "muted" means. Dhruvi Patel, meet Brett Stone. Brett Stone, my business partner and friend, Dhruvi. It is so nice to meet you. You'll have to excuse me. I have lots to do. But the Rocca House is very happy to be working with you. Brett: Thank you. I'm glad you came by. I think we got off on the wrong foot yesterday. I don't know about that. Your parents seemed quite fond of me. Yeah. Slick move, inviting my mom to the tree lighting ceremony. She's definitely Team Brett. Mm. Marci has great taste. I looked up Fernando Colunga. Hmm. So, do you design, uh, for real men or Christmas elves? Are you saying Christmas elves aren't real? What's this? Valle del arcoiris. Rainbow Valley. The mineral deposits create a really unique color palette. But it's a real place? And the border of Bolivia and Chile. My abuela, my grandmother, grew up in a farming village not far from there. Imagine getting to see that every day. Yeah. At 19, she came to America. Alone. Worked hard on a dairy farm in Milwaukee. That's quite a change of scenery. Her people have a saying: "You want to see the rainbow, you got to face the storm." She was amazing, though. My grandfather said that just knowing her made him walk a little taller. Her name was Rachel. That's why my designs are colorful... To honor my heritage and... her bravery. This is where I start before I cut any piece of fabric. You know what? I have an idea. You see this fabric? This is from Ghana. Over there, they celebrate Christmas for a week. They have a parade, and they eat something called fufu. And this one, this one is from Scandinavia. Did you know that in Norway, after the holidays, everybody takes their Christmas tree outside and it gives shelter to the birds until spring? I could make your tuxedo based on your heritage, with the fabric and colors I use. Where is your family from? I could research Christmas traditions... Uh, Rachel, yeah, I'm, uh... I'm... not entirely sure about my Christmas traditions. Why do you mean? You know, not everyone has a colorful grandmother they can point to as their inspiration. I'm sorry. Listen. The reason I stopped by was to hire you. I mentor a kid, a really great kid, and for some reason, he thinks your clothes are, uh... Cutting edge? Designed for the modern man? - Dope. Calls them dope. - I'll take it. He needs a suit, and I, uh, will pay you whatever you charge to make sure that it, uh... Listen. Let's make a deal. Doesn't sound good for me. I will happily make a suit for... - DeMario. - DeMario, free of charge, if you meet me halfway on the tuxedo. I don't think there is a halfway between you and me. Rachel: Well, there better be. I have a lot riding on this. Look. I'll see you tonight, at the tree lighting. And I will pay for DeMario's suit, so please just find me some black fabric for my tuxedo. Like that one, but in an adult size. Is the coast clear? That is the most headstrong person I've ever met. And I still didn't get his measurements. Ugh! Tomas: Thank you. Thank you. Well, this is some hot chocolate. Probably made by the finest Swiss chocolatiers, which are here somewhere being paid to pour it. Oh, stop. Oh! He's here! Brett: Thanks. Thanks. Uh... I'm glad to see you all. You work hard. I know that, and it really gives me some great pleasure to see you and your families having some holiday fun. For your work, I say thank you. You are what makes Connection Link great. I also want to thank you for your generosity. Now, before we get the tree lit tonight, I do want to remind you of our charity, NYC Foster. There's still plenty of time to bring gifts. You know, someone recently told me that, uh, in Norway, people take their Christmas trees outside after the holidays to provide shelter for the birds until spring. See, at Connection Link, we created NYC Foster because we know that there are children who don't have a tree... or gifts this Christmas. They need physical and emotional shelter, so please, give generously. Alright? Shall we get this tree lit? Count down with me. Let's go. Brett, others: Five! Four! Three! Two! One! Beautiful. Oh, I'm glad you made it. The cabbies back home won't believe I got to see this. Don't worry. I'll tag you on my post, - give credit where it's due. - Dad, Brett's a public figure. He's got millions of followers. It's thoughtful of you. Rachel: Speaking of credit, you're a Christmas trivia thief. The trees? In Scandinavia? - You got me. - Tomas: Rachel hasn't gotten her Christmas tree yet. I was wondering if you'd come with us to choose one. I love my Rocca girls, but I need a man - to help me get it on the car. - Uh, no, Dad. I'm perfectly capable of getting my own Christmas tree. I know that you mean well, but just because I'm a woman - doesn't mean that... - Tomas: Cariño, it's... - You got a lot on your plate. - Hey, Tomas. Let me tell you something. Did you... Did you know that male and female reindeer are different? Well, I hope think so. Male reindeer drop their antlers in November, leaving them with none until spring, but the females, the females keep their antlers all throughout winter. And you've seen the pictures of Prancer, Dasher, and Vixen. - Of course. - Well, they always have their antlers, so they must be all women. Santa's sleigh is pulled though the sky by powerful women. Enjoy the festivities and make sure you get some pictures of that hot chocolate fountain. We will. Thanks, Brett. Hey. Thanks... for that. Uh, you know, sometimes they just think I'm... Their little girl? It's kind of nice. I've built an entire fashion house. I've worked hard. I've... And somehow, they think I still need help getting my own Christmas tree, when I'm perfectly capable of doing everything on my own. I get it. Me, too. You, uh, don't have to come to the Christmas tree lot. Uh, I think I do. See, the way I see it, all of this is earning points toward Team Brett's black tuxedo. I wouldn't bet on it. I've got a whole rainbow valley on my side. Oh, she sounds happy. That's good. Make progress with Brett? Oh, wow. That's cool. He's agreed to wear this? Oh, it's not for him. Buenos días! Oh! Working on the accent, but you're getting there. I brought the fabric we discussed, to exchange. - Rachel: Thank you! - Dhruvi: You brought it all the way here yourself? Suspicious. I'm not here to spy, unless you want to show me unless you want to show me your design, let me see what I'm up against. Uh, no way. I will get you the fabric Rachel promised, and then you are out of here. Mm-hmm. Hi! How are you? I want every detail. About Brett Stone. - Come on. - Oh, I don't know any more about him than the rest of the world does. Although... Hmm? Spill the tea. Well, he's not quite as brooding as everyone thinks. I mean, I've known him almost a week, and he actually smiled. Once. Well, count your blessings, Rachel. My bachelor has a friend, a woman friend, who thinks she needs to oversee every stitch. Well, at least you're stitching. I mean, - I haven't even started... - Hey, hey, hey! No more offering information to the enemy camp! - This is a contest, you two! - Rachel: But it's Atticus! I mean, without him, we wouldn't even be here. Uh, yes, you would. You're brilliant. All I did was... Come to my first show? Sit in the front row? Yeah. I'll never forget it. No. Don't be modest. Without you being there, nobody would have paid attention to my designs. Dhruvi: And even though I'm throwing you out, I do appreciate you introducing us at Blaines. Oh, how did the meeting go? Ooh, it went well, except he hasn't agreed - to hear a full pitch yet. - Ah. Marc takes his time. Don't worry. Blaines Park Avenue knows talent. Well, we owe you one regardless. - Rachel: More than one! - Ah, stop. It's impossible to find a true friend in this business. I'm blessed to have you. Mwah. Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah! Okay. I'm off! Back to work! Oh, and, um, I didn't see a thing. Rachel: Hey, can I show you something? - Dhruvi: Yes. - Rachel: So, I was thinking I could do something like this. Nosotras siempre conseguimos un abeto azul. Sí. Pero los pinos escocesés mantienen sus agujas. Marci: Ay. Sí? They're debating the type of tree to get. Ah. Well, uh, I vote Frasier fir. - Not even under consideration. - I figured. Rachel: You know what? Let's split up. Dad, take Mom, go that way. Brett and I will go this way. And we all know the parameters, right? Old brownstone, eight-foot ceiling. But it needs to be a blue spruce! Why is being part of a family so difficult sometimes? Oh, I don't know about that. You seem very fortunate. Yeah. You're right. I'm just a little stressed out right now. I invited them for Christmas, and then I went and agreed to make your tuxedo for the Gala. They go sight-seeing while I'm at work. My dad enjoys getting to know the New York cab drivers. But I'm still worried that they don't have enough to do. You know, in Milwaukee, my dad would be driving Christmas shoppers around. My mom would be making her angels. Angels? Yeah. She makes these really beautiful angels for the church Christmas bazaar. They're really popular. She's even getting started on next year's already. Ah, so is that where you get your talent? I don't know. I never thought of it that way. I always thought I was a Rocca anomaly. Oh, I think you're a Rocca through and through. Marci: I found one! Oh. Thank you, honey. Marci: Mm. Okay. Now you. Oh, no, Mama. What? Brett's a very important person. He can't walk around with pine needles all over him. Mama, stop! You're acting like his mother. That's not such a bad thing, is it, Brett? Well, let's get this tree home and get it decorated. Marci made her eggnog. You'll love it. Oh, no, Dad. You can't monopolize Brett's time like that. He's a very busy person. Yes. Uh, thank you, but I... I do have a prior commitment. Yeah. We wouldn't want to keep you from your plans. You know what? If you'd be okay with me bringing a plus one, I... I'd love to help decorate the tree. - Plus one? - Tomas: Yes, of course. The more, the merrier. Straight? Marci: Izquierda. Más. Izquier... No. Sí. Perfecto. So, this should dispel any matchmaking ideas you two have been harboring. And be nice to the woman he's bringing. Cariño, you seem far more concerned about Brett's plus one than we are. It's all you've talked about since we got home. That's not true. I'll get that. Welcome! Please, come in. So happy to have you in our home. And who's this? Rocca family, please meet... DeMario Truitt. The famous DeMario! I understand I'm going to make you a suit. Your clothes are hype, Ms. Rocca. Oh, call me Rachel. Did you hear that? My clothes are hype. That's one word for them. Those are your mom's angels? Yeah. I get a new one every year. Ah. They're really beautiful. I can see how her daughter became a designer. Hold still. Uh, the designer has an idea. Uh, I think the whole idea is to decorate the tree, not un-decorate it. Okay. There you go. A little color. Didn't hurt, did it? No. Didn't hurt at all. Tomas: Here they are. DeMario found them. The box of family ornaments from when Rachel was small. Marci: Ah! Rachel was something, even back then. One time, while practicing for the church Christmas pageant, she insisted on being a shepherd, even though boys had already been chosen for the roles. I'll never forget. She said to the director, "My grandmother tended to animals in Bolivia. Women can be shepherds, too." Did they let you be a shepherd? Uh, no. I was a donkey. Which... now that I think of it... Oh, my... Tell us about your family, DeMario. I live with Sloan and her husband, Luke. You know, uh, the other day at Connection Link, - we were, uh... - It's... it's okay. I grew up in foster homes, Mr. Rocca. My story has a lot of... twists and turns. Well, it's been a long time since I've met such a fine young man, twists and turns and all. DeMario: I'm submitting my college applications now. My grades are good. Hopefully, the future is a little less... Well, it's like Brett is always telling me. The best way to predict the future is to create it. Actually, Abraham Lincoln said that, uh, but Rachel knows. I mean, I'm a shameless Christmas trivia thief, too. Brett has really been there for me. He's the guy that always shows up. Always. Holding I'll be holding Holding on to you Holding, holding DeMario, honey, I want you to have this. For Christmas. My own angel? Marci: To watch over you. Iluminando el camino. - Lighting the way. - Thank you. We're home as long as you are here Tomorrow at Connection Link, we have Martha Stewart teaching garland making. Marci: What? Will you be my guest? - Uh, absolutely! - Can I come, too? Yeah, both of you, and stay for lunch. Something to do while Rachel's working. Isn't that a little premature? We haven't even heard from Blaines yet. Well, when you win, we will, and I want to have the bones of a sales deck ready for his viewing pleasure. Okay. How would you describe the new line? I don't know. Let me give it some more thought. I need to get this suit ready for the seamstress today and then give my full attention to the tux. I've wasted an entire week already trying to get Brett to see things my way, but the clock is ticking. Okay. How does this one hit you? For Brett? Are you sure? - No, for DeMario. - Oh. But Brett and I did have a breakthrough last night. - Mm? - He actually let me put a red Christmas ribbon into his pocket. Sounds like a regular quantum leap. You should see him with DeMario. He's almost... fun. I'm starting to think that there's a man beyond the public image that he only lets certain people see. Way beyond. Maybe, but I've decided to dress that man for the Gala. The hidden one. And I think I know how to do it. Dhruvi: Well? You going to tell me or what? Oh. No. Rachel, are you okay with gold buttons instead of silver? Uh, yeah. Buttons? Silver? Good. Love it. - I'll have it on time, but... - Yeah. - I just wanted you to know. - Okay. Are you beatboxing? I wasn't beatboxing. "Jingle Bells." You were beatboxing "Jingle Bells." You are hearing things. What's on your mind? Just when I thought I figured out how to work with one demanding executive, Sybil Neale calls, taking me up on my offer to help with the Gala. Good luck. She's way worse than me. Since NYC Foster is our charity, she wants us to put something on the table. You know, as a favor to the guests. Hmm. A favor? It's something that they can take home that reminds them of the event. Ideally, I'd like to remind them of the kids in foster care. I was thinking a brochure, but that la... Brett: An angel. A what? Everyone gets an angel. Okay. An angel. Come in! - Hey! - Hey. Rachel: Thanks for coming to get measured. Just give me a second. This is DeMario's suit. What do you think? It's perfect for him. Yeah. I can't tell you how happy designing this suit made me. All day, even though I have so much to do, I just kept thinking how I was somehow contributing to his inevitable success. Yeah. I mean, DeMario has a way, doesn't he? You can't help but root for him. Yeah. But it's also more than that. I mean, Dhruvi and I have been brainstorming ways to elevate the brand, and we're trying to get a menswear line into Blaines. And all day, I've just been struggling, try to articulate, you know, like, what it is that I'm dreaming of. Like, what is the menswear line? Well, tell me more. Well, um, I mean, DeMario's suit, for instance. All I want is for him to feel confident when he puts it on. You know, show the world who he is. And it dawned on me. That's what my menswear line is... Finely tailored, colorful designs that make the everyday man walk a little taller. Well, with that much enthusiasm, you almost had me convinced. You just wait. I'm going to start designing for women, too. Don't underestimate me. You know, I'm learning a lot of things these days. One of which is, don't ever underestimate Rachel Rocca. Oh, yeah? What else are you learning? Well, she's smart, she's gifted, she's determined, and I find her completely irresistible. Lift up your arms. Please. You know, normally, you have to wrap the tape around the model to get a measurement. - Yeah, I know. - You know? I've done this, like, hundreds of times. Mm-hmm? Hold still. Okay. That's... Let's go, Tomas. We don't want to be late on our first day. I'll grab your coat. It's chilly. Wait. Nobody move. What's going on? Oh, hi, honey. Did we wake you? Dad, what are you wearing? It's my uniform. You like it? We work at Connection Link now. We wanted to wait up to tell you last night, but you worked so late. What do you mean, you work at Connection Link? Oh, it's just a seasonal thing. One of Brett's drivers asked for an extended holiday, so here I am. Marci: And I've been hired to make angels, 200 of them! I was given a craft room and a small staff. I'm training them today. Oh, I hope they catch on quick. I have a brand to protect. Tomas: Have a good day, Rach. Love you, honey. Marci: Don't worry about us for dinner. Who knows how late we'll be? What do you think? Fitted? Or a bit more loose? It's perfect, too. You're the client, DeMario. Can't all be perfect. You got to speak up. I've never had anything this nice. Watch this. Hey, you're pretty good at that. I love it, Rachel. Thank you. Oh, I love it, too. It fits my design aesthetic perfectly. You get me, DeMario. Oh, I get you. You're fly, girl. Now, I just have to convince Brett. He's so stubborn with that tux. Stubborn? Never noticed that. Are we talking about the same Brett Stone, founder of Connection Link? If people only knew what Brett's been through, - they would understand him. - What's Brett been through? Your suit's not only going to get me into college. Just wait until Bethann Horton sees me in it. Marci: Sure. Brett: I'm going to learn from you. Marci: Oh, thank you. The secret is to press down firmly on the cookie. Alright. Perfecto. Tomas: Now, he's a pro. Amazing. What in the world? I'm sorry. When I asked if we could do our fitting here, I didn't... Look at the apron I found Brett. Isn't it perfect? Wait. They talked you into making cookies? No, alfajores, just like how they're made in Bolivia. Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah. Don't... Don't you even think of eating one, because if you don't bake it... Both: You can't take it. Rachel, you know how to make alfajores. Why don't you finish this last batch with Brett? Your dad and I are bushed, and we need to, uh, get our rest for work tomorrow. I'm not... You're very tired. Exhausto. I'm so sorry. And a little embarrassed. Yeah, but just take a look at this apron. I mean, it's just my style, huh? Ooh, I made something for my father's uniform, just to see your face, but I think you need it more. Ho, ho, ho. Yeah! Now, that's Christmas! Oh. Can I ask you something? - Yeah. - Why black? I mean, why all black? That's a story for another day. Okay. Should we try on your tux? - Yeah. - Okay. I'm looking forward to seeing this. Rachel: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You're not getting flour on my work. Come here. Alright. Okay. Please tell me my tuxedo doesn't have a big red flower on it. Would you wear it if it did? The way I'm feeling right now, I just might. Tuxedo time. I hate it. Thank goodness. Rachel: Absolutely hate it. But it's not because it's not fabulous. It is. It's just not fabulous on you. Mm. no. No, it's not. Ugh, but the problem is, I'm not sure I know - exactly what would be. - Well, I'm not sure I've mentioned this, but you know, black, black really suits me. See, I don't think so. You know, I know you think that I'm just trying to advance my brand, my aesthetic. Yeah. It's crossed my mind. And I am. Of course I am. You're a businessman. You know exactly what that opportunity means to me. But it's more than that now. I'm starting to see... well, part of who you really are. When we first met at the hotel, I thought... well, I thought we were the most ill-suited pair in the room. Ill-suited? I was cursing the candy cane that brought us together. You know, I know there's things you're not telling me, and that's fine. You know, these things take time. But I really... I really think it would help if I knew a little more about you... Mm. So that I could design - for the real you... - Rach... Because I'm pretty sure Brett Stone is not all dark and somber and serious. It's just his well-spun public image. Well-spun? Cultivated. Curated. Refined. Yeah. I know... I know what it means, Rachel. Look. You have a goal, okay? And I have a goal. Um, right now, they're not aligned. Well, maybe we could talk about things, - come up with some ideas. - Rachel, you want to know more. I was a foster kid... just like DeMario. My first foster parent, Daryl, took me to my mother's funeral. He was, uh, a very kind man. Somehow scrounged up a kid's black suit for me to wear. Only three people came. One was the police officer who had helped me. I remember she saw me and she said... "Look at you in that black suit. That's a power suit. I think you're going to go places." She was just trying to encourage me, and I guess it worked. I never forgot those words. Yeah. It left quite an impression. Listen. The only reason I even agreed to participate in the auction in the first place was to bring attention to my charity, NYC Foster. - People will pay attention. - Yeah, but can't you see that I don't want the headlines to be about what I wear? I... I don't want it to be about how it's the first time anybody's ever seen Brett Stone in a... in a colorful tuxedo. That's what these people focus on. I want everyone to focus on the kids, Rachel, the foster kids, and about how they need help. Who cares what I wear? Rachel: I do. I have to. My whole future may be riding on it. Okay. So, you have a call with Chef Jose Andreas at noon. Brett: Yes. Uh, make sure we send him a substantial donation. Sloan: Right. Brett: Gee, Sloan. I wonder who that could be. Probably a sharply dressed teenager. Huh? Did Rachel do me a solid or what? That girl has talent. Come on, big guy. The photographer's taking my college photos today. Lay on some compliments. You look great. And just in time, because Rachel is not too happy with me right now, guys. Sloan: Hmm. DeMario: You know all that help and advice you give me? Yeah. I seem to recall a few moments. Well, now, it's my turn to repay you. There is one area of life where I'm the mentor and you're the student. Besides personal style? I'm talking about love. Oh. Please, expound. It's obvious to everyone... Right, Sloan? - Right. - That you like Rachel Rocca. Like, really like. You just need to let her see your true self. That's what I've been saying! You're the best, Brett. She couldn't do better than you. I'm not sure she sees it the same way. Well, dude, there's a certain Bethann who works in the mailroom that hasn't seen me in this suit yet. If you're not going to go for it, I am. - We've created a monster. - I think we have. But... I think our monster's on to something. You have everything you could have ever wanted... except for the one thing that you really want. Come in. You win, Brett Stone. The photo shoot's in a week, and it'll be written all over your face if you hate the tuxedo. - Black it is. - I'll wear whatever you want. Orange. Red. Emerald green. I'll even wear a rainbow if you want. That's not funny. We both have a lot at stake. I'm not trying to be funny. Then what are you saying? Why don't you put down the scissors? And I'll tell you. Please. Last night, when you said I have a well-spun public image... I'm not ashamed of being a foster kid, at all. As a matter of fact, I'm... quite proud of how far I've come. Why don't you tell people? All I want to do is protect my mother. She loved me very much, but she struggled, and we found ourselves in places. Tough places. She's been gone 23 years this Christmas. She loved the holidays, and I know she never had any intention of missing this many. Sometimes, I imagine what she would think of me. My father calls it "rebosante de orgullo." Bursting with pride. My mom's life doesn't need to be fodder for these gossip columns. I just... I don't understand why there's so much fascination about me in the media, online. Everybody loves a wildly successful, mysterious man. They've read too many romance novels. All I want to do is guard my mother's reputation. I'm still protecting her heart. So I... I keep my past to myself but pour everything that I have into the foster kids. Thank you for telling me. I hope it helped you as much as it helped me. Next time you're tempted to get irritated with those great parents of yours, even though they meddle and don't understand you, consider the alternative. Okay? I'll let you get back to work. Photo shoot in a week. - Hi. - Oh, my goodness. Everyone's here tonight. I'll never get any work done. Yeah. I saw Brett on my way in. Well? You clearly want to tell me something. What's going on? Before I do, I have to warn you. You are going to have mixed emotions about this. I just got off the phone with the business manager at Atticus Winter's Fashion House. He got engaged! Why are you so happy that the business manager got engaged? No. The bachelor. Atticus Winter's bachelor got engaged and no longer wants to be auctioned off at the Gala. - What? - Atticus is out of the Christmas Runway competition. Now, I know you're going to be sad about this, but look at it this way. Atticus is already a global brand. Something like this won't affect him at all. We both know he was our biggest competition. Now, we have an even greater chance of winning, of proving what you are capable of. - Yeah, but Atticus and I... - Ah! Back to work. This needs to be the tuxedo of all tuxedos, and I have to take this. You got this, Rachel. Hi. Yes. Let me just get to my office. I've got those numbers for you. Tomas: And it's hard to find the time to wrap her gifts in secret. Marciela Rocca has eyes in the back of her head. We've barely seen Rachel in three days. Working around the clock in her studio. Well, here she is now. Looks like she's coming by the office later. Um, look. I can't force her to rest, but I will make sure she eats something, okay? Ugh. All night again? Are you happy? It needs a bit of tweaking, but overall, I'm ecstatic. Oh! Come here. I guess the better question is, will Brett be happy? Oh, that doesn't even matter. Oh. I mean, I like your moxie, but why do I get the feeling this isn't going to work out so well? It doesn't matter what Brett thinks, because he's not going to be wearing it. Here. These are Brett's measurements. Call Atticus right away and give them to him. His team can make the adjustments to the tuxedo easily. Uh, I don't understand. I'm giving Atticus my model for the Christmas Runway contest. - Dhruvi: But... - Atticus always uses black in his formalwear. I have no doubt that he did it again. Rachel, I realize you haven't slept, but have you lost your mind? We need this. Blaines Park Avenue? What if told you I've figured out a better way to show Blaines exactly who we are? What could be better than Brett Stone wearing your tux? Showing everyone at the Gala that we're the fashion house that makes men walk a little taller. Rachel... Yeah. Hear me out. What is all of this? Uh, you know, just a quiet dinner for a woman who hasn't eaten all day or all week. True. But don't dim the lights too much. I might go off to La La Land. Ah, that would be okay, too, if that's what you need. Please. Don't tell me Gordon Ramsey is going to walk in and serve our dinner. No. Uh... takeout. This is the only place I could think of where we'd be completely alone. It's perfect. So, how's the tux coming along? Uh, about that... If it's okay with you, I'd like you to wear Atticus Winter's design. Why? Please. It would mean a lot to me. Not sure I'm following. Well... what if I told you I've thought of a way that we could both reach our goals? It was actually you who made me see it, when you said that you didn't want people thinking about what you were wearing at the Gala; you wanted them focusing on something more important... The foster kids. You were absolutely right, and it made me realize that I don't want people talking about one tuxedo I design. I want them to understand something bigger... My vision. I want them to know that Rachel Rocca is the designer that makes everyday men walk tall, just like my abuela did. And you, Brett Stone, are not an everyday man. You're not my model. Brett: Hmm. Mm. That's the nicest rejection I've ever gotten. Okay. I promised you I'd wear whatever you wanted me, and if that's Atticus Winters's tuxedo, then that's what I'm going to wear. Thank you, Brett. Of course. But I do think I'm going to have an interesting future. Oh, yeah? Yeah. It says here I can now bet on my favorite bachelor without looking like I'm promoting my own brand. You're planning to bid on me. Does this mean you now believe we are well suited for each other? It just might. Woman: A little to the left, Mr. Stone. That's great. Perfect. Thank you. Wow. The tuxedo looks great. Thank you. Helps that it's being worn by a smoldering ice god. "Smoldering ice god"? Is there even such a thing? Yeah. You're looking at him. It's funny. It's almost as if you designed it for him. It's perfect. If you did this because you feel like you owe me... No! Hey. It's like you said. It's because we're impossible friends in a dog-eat-dog industry. We are, aren't we? So, who's your new model? Somebody I know? A newcomer. Oh, do tell. Well, I... Mr. Winters, do you have a moment to talk to me about your design? Writing an article for the spread. Oh, absolutely. This way. Well? You looked, uh, great. You look absolutely stunning. So, who's your model? It's my fault. The traffic was terrible. Okay. There's plenty of time. DeMario, your tuxedo's back there. The garment suit has my name on it. You can change behind the curtain. Oh! Brett. That's my model... Mr. DeMario Truitt. Mr. Stone, any chance I could get a quote for the article? Actually, yes. I'd love to tell you about NYC Foster. So sorry we're late. The traffic, and we got talking. Cariño, did you know that Brett grew up a foster kid, too? Uh, let's, uh, talk about that at home, okay? I got to go help DeMario. He's next. And that's how we ensure that every donation goes directly to the children. Great. I think I got what I need. Thank you. Tomas, um, look. I'm going to change, but, uh, you mind taking DeMario back on his own? Of course. Thank you. That Brett Stone has a fitting name, huh? Handsome, but it's like talking to a brick wall. Yeah. He's all business. That's for sure. It's like, relax, pal. Just try smiling a little bit, right? If the two of you had one inkling about Brett's past, you wouldn't dare make such flippant comments. And you are? I'm his driver. What did you mean... about Brett's past? Just be a little more kind to people. It's Christmas. Well, that guy's loyal. Yeah. I think I just stumbled to a bigger story than bachelors in bowties. Time to do some real digging. Huh. You know, I was thinking we can go together. - How does that sound? - Should I tell my dad - that he'll be driving us? - No. I'm... I'm going to take - one of my personal cars. - Oh! And I'm going to drive it myself, because I don't think I need your father, you know, watching the long goodnight kiss I give his daughter after the Gala. Oh! You plan to kiss me? Often. Yeah. But not tonight. You need to sleep. Let me see you in. I'm perfectly capable of walking myself into my home. I know, but I'm not taking my eyes off of you - until you're inside anyway. - What could possible happen to me between here and there? Maybe I just like looking at you. Still here. It's kind of nice, isn't it, having someone who won't underestimate you but still wants to look out for you? Kind of nice. Goodnight, Rachel. You know what? I don't think I'm too tired for that kiss. You're done for, Rachel. Marci: Rachel. Go up to bed, honey. Sleep the entire day. You've earned it. And miss the wrapping party? Oh, no. Not a chance. Okay. I'll go make some coffee. You go take a shower, okay? Rachel: Mm. And then fold the corners in. - Excellent. - Beep, beep! - Hey, Bethann. - Hi. Um, oh, uh, something came for you, DeMario, - in the mailroom. - Thanks. Okay. Bye. Bye. It's from NYU. Go ahead. I got in! Congratulations, DeMario! Oh, my gosh! Okay. I... I will be right back. I... I need to make a quick call to Luke. He's going to be so happy. I never doubted you for a second. Congratulations! It was the suit. No. It's because you're dope. You. Thank you. For what? For DeMario. And for what you've done for me. Well, I'm not the only one doing things. You gave my parents jobs. You're absolutely crazy. I was just trying to get your attention by any means possible. Oh. Well, it worked. You have my full attention. I need to speak with you. What's happened? Um... I just got an email from the editor of Premiere Fashion magazine, asking if we care to comment before he publishes the article. He sent me an advanced draft. I... The headline reads, "The Truth Behind Connection Link Founder's Heart of Stone." I just looked at it quickly. It has a lot of information about your mom, your... Pretty much reveals your whole past... and hers. Yeah, but only a few people even know. I mean, who would... I don't know. Rachel, did you... No comment. Tell him I have no comment. Brett, I... Are we going to talk about this? You heard me. No comment. I tried calling him last night, to talk. Give him some more time. Time isn't going to fix this. I can't believe he would think I would talk to that journalist. I don't think there is any fixing this. I, uh, think this may be, uh... My fault. What are you talking about, Dad? Big guy. Hey. Have a seat. We better get going, man. It's only two hours until the Gala. Question. What do you plan to do if one of these women actually buys a date with you? I thought you knew. Knew what? Rachel made a deal with Sybil Neale. Any bids for me are going to go towards my college tuition. Your... your what? Wait. I already told you I would pay. This way, I can kind of earn some of it. Rachel told me to walk tall, that I'm going places. She gets me. She gets you, too, and that's no easy thing, man. And you know what? Maybe that article isn't such a bad thing. Yeah. I don't... I don't want to talk about it. When I went to my first foster home, I was scared. Really scared. If I had known that the founder of Connection Link had been in my shoes once, I think that would have helped me. Imagine. Brett Stone is just like me. Who knows how that magazine got the info on your mom? Just doesn't seem like something Rachel would do, though, does it? Marci: She needs to win. Something to help lift her spirits. I'm not sure winning the contest is all she needs. The most handsome cabbie to ever drive the streets in Milwaukee. Well, it doesn't hurt that I have a beautiful woman on my arm. Now, Let's go support our girl no matter what happens. - Yes. - I'll get your coat. Thank you. Tomas: Brett! Brett: I was, uh, hoping to catch Rachel before the Gala so we can talk. She left early to explain everything to DeMario. I wanted to see you both, too, to apologize. No, no, no, no, no. I should apologize, Brett. I'm very, very fond of your daughter. I mean, she's... She's all I can think about. If there's one thing I know about Rachel, it's that she's fallen for you, too, son. Son? Yes. We share a name. Did you know, Brett, that Rocca and Stone mean the same thing, rock and stone? It doesn't mean that we were made hard and unmovable. It means we always have a firm place to stand. We're strong, like a mountain. Well, I may have to move a mountain to get Rachel back. - My behavior was... - If you want to see the rainbow, you have to face the storm. Face the storm? Now, let's go and get our girl, okay? Vámonos. Let's go. Sybil: He is a staple on Wall Street with advanced knowledge of complex investment scenarios. This bachelor knows what to do with all that bacon you ladies bring home. Who would like to start the bidding? I see $1,000. The guys won't believe this. Sybil: Can I get $2,000? And what do you think of our city, Mr. Rocca? - Oh, it's something, for sure. - Ah. Get ready. I think your daughter is about to be the pride of New York. Whatever New York thinks of Rachel hardly matters. She's always been the pride of Tomas and Marciela Rocca. Rebosante de orgullo. Bursting with pride. Sybil: Sold for $3,500! Our next model is a newcomer to the runway. He is proud to represent tonight's charity, NYC Foster... - This is it. It's DeMario. - Wow. It's DeMario. Sybil: because he grew up in foster care himself. Please welcome DeMario Truitt. Hey! Sybil: Mr. Truitt has recently been accepted to NYU. So, any bids for DeMario this evening are not for a date, but they will offset his college tuition. I see $10,000! Well, that should buy a textbook or two. Rachel, honey, that tuxedo is to die for. I want one. Well, it'll cost you. Bet on DeMario's tuition, and I'll make it happen. $10,000 more! Amazing! And now for our final bachelor. I know many of you have been holding on to your wallets, waiting for him. Please welcome Mr. Brett Stone to the runway. I'd like you to read from these cards instead. Sorry to scoop your magazine's scoop, but if anyone is going to tell my story, it's going to be me. - What's going on? - I don't know. Sybil: "Brett Stone agreed to be auctioned tonight because he wants to bring attention to his charity, NYC Foster. But he has recently come to realize that the best way to do that is to tell the truth about his past. Brett lived in five different foster homes before turning 18. His mother, who was no stranger to trouble... passed when he was nine. Brett is proud to represent NYC Foster, and he wants to set the record straight. You may think that being the founder of Connection Link is his greatest accomplishment, but supporting his fellow foster children actually is." You know what? I will be right back. Okay. Mr. Nielson. It's good to see you again. - Marc, please. - Marc. I was completely taken with the tuxedo Rachel designed. DeMario stole the whole show. You could just see how great he felt in it. He was walking tall. Exactly. I think Blaines Park Avenue is very interested in a menswear line like that. Early in the new year, would you be willing to sit down, hammer out the details? Yes. I would. Thank you. And Merry Christmas. You, too. Oh. Don't mind if I do. Forgive me. Or dance with me. I mean, I'll take whatever at this point. I heard you went for quite a price. I think Sybil said it was a Gala record on any bachelor. I bought myself. What? That was Sloan calling out higher bids from the back until she won. There's only one woman in this room I want to go on a date with, and I figured she would not be bidding tonight. No. So, would you go on a date with me? I mean, for what it cost, we could visit Santa at the North Pole for Christmas dinner. Twice. Rachel: I don't know. If we do this, you're going to have to learn to trust me. I know. I do. But be patient with me. I'm still trying to extricate myself from a well-spun public image. Detach. Disentangle. Rescue. Yeah. I know what "extricate" means. So, what do you say? A date? Can I choose what suit you wear? Rachel, you can choose every suit I ever wear again. Sybil: Ladies and gentlemen, if I could have your attention, please? The judges have deliberated, and the winner of the Christmas Runway Contest is... Rachel Rocca. You did it! You did it! Rachel, come on up for a photo, please. Take a photo with me. DeMario! Uh, wait. Okay. I'm ready now. Congratulations, Rachel. Thank you. Man: Alright! Everybody, let's hit the dance floor! Let's dance. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! - Tomas: Congratulations. - Thank you. Tomas: Congrats. DeMario! Dhruvi! We did it!
