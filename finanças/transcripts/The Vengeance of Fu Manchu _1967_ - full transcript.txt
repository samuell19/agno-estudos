My Lord, we welcome you to the home of your ancestors. Fu Manchu, your arrival is well timed. There are among us some who desired to prevent your return. They shall now be brought forward, to learn their final punishment. Let the judgement begin. Bring in the prisoners! For you, there can be only one punishment: death! The method, Father? The choice is yours. For this one, Father, I would suggest a slower death. You have no will of your own. You will obey my command. Kill him! Let rumours be spread amongst the villagers below of a terrible earthquake that has destroyed - all pathways over the mountains. - Yes, Master. Now, the world will believe our isolation is complete. We are yours to command, Father. Now, my work can begin. A work of infinite pleasure. A work of vengeance. Vengeance against one man! - Ah, good afternoon, Jasmin. - Good afternoon, sir. - Is tea ready yet? - In a moment, sir. Good. - Oh, Dr Petrie's waiting for you. - Oh? I think he's fallen asleep. Oh, has he? Good gracious, what are you doing with that thing? For a moment, I thought you were going to shoot me. Well, you know, my dear fellow, stranger things have happened. Nayland Smith arrested for murder? That would hit the headlines, wouldn't it? But why the pistol? I'm going abroad tomorrow. And, as you know, I always travel armed, ever since our last little encounter with Fu Manchu. I thought we'd agreed never to mention that name again? Quite right, Petrie, as ever. - Where are you going? - Paris. I'm going to see Inspector Javal, and one or two old friends of mine. And we're planning something quite new. It's an international organisation of police chiefs. - We're going to call it Interpol. - Interpol? - Mm-hmm. - Sounds like a patent medicine. Well, to a doctor, I suppose it just might. Pathologist, if you don't mind. Ah, Jasmin! - Evening paper, sir. - Thank you, Jasmin. Ah, muffins! Jasmin, you're an angel. - Hello! An earthquake in China. - Oh? One of the Northern provinces. All communications cut off from Peking and Shanghai. Might interest Jasmin. The province in question happens to be Kwang Su. Kwang Su? Haven't I heard of that before somewhere? Quite possibly. It's the birthplace of Fu Manchu. My dear fellow! He's dead! - Jasmin, will you pack my bags at once, please? - Yes, sir. I think I'll catch that aeroplane for Paris tonight. Ah, good morning, gentlemen. Ah, bonjour, mon vieux. Ça va? - Welcome to you all. - Thank you. We here in the Sûreté, are happy to be the hosts of this first international conference. We owe a great deal to the distinguished member of the Vienna Police Force, Kommissar Strauss. - Kommissar. - Kommissar. At whose suggestion, this meeting is taking place. I would also like to introduce you to another good friend. Most of you know him already. Commissioner Nayland Smith from Scotland Yard. - Commissioner. - Commissioner. Gentlemen. Now, I think that, er... all of us here today are conscious of the fact that we're living in a changing world. Fast liners cross the Atlantic in five days, and, only yesterday evening, I myself flew from London to Paris in just under two hours. Now, unfortunately, it's not only the innocent who live in this ever-speedier world, but also the guilty. And if we are to continue our fight against organised crime, and prevent it from reaching a world-wide level, then we, too, must organise ourselves - on a world-wide basis. - Hear, hear. Now, for that reason, I am particularly glad to welcome to our conference today a visitor from the United States. Now, he is a member of that organisation of which you will doubtless have heard, the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Gentlemen, Mr Mark Weston. - Welcome here. - Welcome. Thank you, Commissioner. Gentlemen, we at the FBI don't have the same history as Scotland Yard, but I hope, before long, we can establish the same fine traditions. In America, as you know, organised crime has become a threat to our way of life. We've enjoyed some success, but our latest information is that the gangs of America are seeking to reorganise, and to appoint a new leader. A super-criminal, whose organising ability and resources might enable them to dominate the world. A world of crime. This very morning, I learned by cable from Washington that one of the most powerful criminals in the United States has left San Francisco. We believe that he has been appointed as an ambassador from the criminals of America, to seek, and find, this new mastermind. His name is Rudolph Moss. His destination, gentlemen, is unknown. Rudy, what's wrong with you? Since we left America, you're so strange. Mm-hmm. It isn't the holiday trip you promised me. Honey, a beautiful girl like you shouldn't talk so much. Rudy, why don't you trust me? I trust nobody. Darling, don't make any mistake. The time is coming to break up your... ...beautiful romance. Oh, but Rudy... Come on, stop that! I have a job to do, and you, too. Here's the contract. You're guaranteed a leading spot in the show at Shanghai. The Paradise Bar. The owner's name is Kurt Heller. He's one of my men. He will look after you. But remember, no female tricks. You see, I haven't forgotten the ambition you had when I picked you up out of that dreary little club in Copenhagen. Very well. But couldn't you at least tell me where you are going, and what for? I'm going to the ends of the earth, to meet the devil himself, and, if the devil agrees, we will become partners. Come on, darling. Tell me, who sent you to spy on me? Fu Manchu. It was Fu Manchu. - Fu Manchu? - Be quiet! - But why? - Ssh! No-one... No-one must know my mission. I'm sure that guy was sent to spy on me. Sorry he didn't succeed. To Wooi! Two hundred miles from here, in a village called Pan Soo, there lives a Christian missionary. His name is Dr Lieberson. He has a daughter. - You will bring them here. - Yes, Master. Next! Sit down. Lock the gates! Seize him! Who are you? Come with us. Take his instruments. Take him away. Burn the village! Burn it! For the last time, Dr Lieberson, will you work for my father? I've told you ten times already. Stop! I... I'll work for you. So be it. - You know my orders? - Yes, Father. Take the doctor to his room, which has been prepared, - and bring the prisoner, too. - Yes. This man is the subject of our experiment. Your task... is to transform him into the man in this photograph. It's possible, but it will take time. Your instruments are here. You have exactly 48 hours. But, er... I... I must remove the skin. The pain will be unbearable. I must have anaesthetics. That will not be necessary. He will feel no pain. Still, it's not possible. May I remind you, Dr Lieberson, that the branding iron is still hot? I will try. You have completed your work? You can look for yourself. Remove the bandages. Question him! The place of your birth? London. Your name? Nayland Smith. The face of Nayland Smith. The mind of a murderer. Smile! Life's full of fun. Come on in! Oh, Captain. - The junk's alongside now. - Very good. I'm ready. Remember, when you get to Shanghai, go to Heller. - Do exactly as I told you. - Yes. Yeah, good. Oh, yeah... Thank you. You needn't bother to count it. Honour among thieves, Captain. We'd better go. They're waiting. Don't forget me. Goodbye, Captain, and thank you. And this, gentlemen, is our Communications Room. Radio senders, receivers, even the latest teleprinter, which, as you know, now extends as far as the United States, and even the Orient. Ah, a message from Yokohama. By coincidence, Mr Weston, it's for you. Oh? Thank you. Mmm. - Bad news, I'm afraid. - Oh? The Ambassador from the American underworld. Hmm? You remember, the man I was telling you about. - Rudolph Moss. - Oh, yes. He's been traced to Japan, where he's been in touch with the Japanese underworld. Is he still in Japan? He left yesterday, aboard the SS Orient Star. Maigret! Shipping Intelligence, quickly! Ah, here we are. Orient Star departed Yokohama 29th. Next port of call, Shanghai. Shanghai? Oh, that's my old territory. Oh, of course, the International Police Force you commanded. You must have many friends there. One or two. I'm addressing this to Inspector Ramos of the Shanghai Police. He's the son of an old colleague of mine. The boat will be met. Good. - Could you send this for me, please? - Of course. If we know his ultimate destination, we have a chance of identifying this new mastermind. If I wasn't absolutely sure he was dead... It could be another old friend of mine. But, happily for us, that's impossible. Anyway, I'm off on my holiday in a couple of days. Oh, you're a lucky man. Where are you going? I'm meeting Dr Petrie in Ireland. Oh, I'll be in London myself at the end of the month. - Splendid, my dear fellow. - Shall we... You must give me the pleasure of showing you around Scotland Yard. Thank you very much. Come in. Thank you. Give me the Harbour Police. Harbour Police speaking. This is Inspector Ramos. Has the Orient Star docked? - She's due in two hours. - Good. I want a fast launch at the Settlement Pier in fifteen minutes. I'm going aboard before she enters the harbour. Come in. Oh, good morning, Miss Svensson. I've just had a wireless message from Leone's agents in Shanghai. It seems that the International Police are interested in the, er... missing Mr Moss. There's a police launch on its way. - And what do you want me to do? - The pilot's boat is still alongside. The sooner you're ashore, the better. Very well. Oh, Miss Svensson... I understand you're a singer? Yes, I'm going to work in Shanghai, at the Paradise Bar. Oh. Are you familiar with that establishment? No. Why? I just have a letter of engagement from the owner. - Kurt Heller? - Uh-huh. Pal of your friend Mr Moss, I believe? That's right. I'm told it's a very popular place. Yes, you might call it that. Well, thank you, Miss Svensson. You may be hearing from the police, so be on your guard. - Thank you. Goodbye. - Goodbye. Paradise Bar.

Only in her friends. Well, she has just arrived. She hasn't had time to make any friends. I was referring to the old ones. Excuse me. - You are the singer, Ingar Svensson? - Yes. Good evening, Miss Svensson. I would like to ask you a few questions. And your friend. Throw those two in the jail. I'll question them in the morning. - Looking for someone, sir? - Yes, a lady. And, through the lady, a certain man. - You are Rudolph Moss? - Yes, I am. Known throughout the world, by crooks and cops, as "Rudy the Beauty". I have been waiting for you. I bring greetings from my father, Fu Manchu. Yeah, I slipped overboard two nights ago, and it has taken two days to reach here on that miserable little dinghy. Listen, I'm not Marco Polo. How much further do I have to go? It is a long journey across the mountains. It will take many days. Hey, hey, don't shake that case around, you clumsy fool! It's full of my favourite cigars. Fu Manchu awaits you. - Hello, old boy. - Here we are, my dear fellow. - Did you have a good trip? - Yes. Hop in. - Thank you very much indeed. - Thank you, sir. Right, we're away. - Well, that's funny. - What is it? It's as dry as a bone. I filled her up last night. By Jove! I'd say we're in luck! Can I be of help? We've run out of petrol, I'm afraid. Could you give me a lift to the nearest garage? Good man! I'll stay here and mind the bags. Righto. What is it, old man? Greetings. Hi! Well, I bring you here a sworn statement from America, Europe, and the East, signed by the men of power in those countries. We know of your desire to build up an empire, in which you would command the criminal masterminds of the world. All right, We offer you now this role, if you will become our leader. I accept your offer. You, in your turn, must accept my authority, and my leadership. My objective is vengeance. The means... death! - Death? - The death of our enemies. I intend to destroy all those you have cause to fear. Those who have made it their business to fight crime. But... But that's impossible! It is not impossible. And I will prove it to you. At this very moment, some ten thousand miles away from here, my vengeance is about to begin. I thought you were in Ireland, sir, with the master? So we should have been. Now, listen. - He's been taken ill. - Is it serious? I don't know. It's as if he were in a trance. Never speaks a word. Shows no emotions. Ah, my dear fellow. Will you wait downstairs, please?

Ramos has his eye on me. The whole place is being watched. We have to get out of here as soon as possible. But where can we go? There's only one place to go. - And we'll go together, all right? - All right. Send your men in, Sergeant. Where is Heller and the girl? They left about three minutes ago. - In which direction? - North Gate, sir. Good. Carry on, Sergeant. So, Rudy Moss leads me to the singer, and she secretly meets a girl, who resembles Fu Manchu's daughter, Lin Tang. And now, both Heller and Ingrid leave hurriedly by the North Gate. The direction to Kwang Su province. Have this information cabled to London. - Immediately! - Very good, sir. Come in. Mr Weston, sir. - I'm very glad to see you, Mr Weston. - Doctor. What's this I hear about Nayland Smith? Bad news, I'm afraid. He got taken very ill in Ireland. I just brought him back to London today. - Well, what's the matter with him? - Well, it baffles me. He seems to have changed his whole personality. Hardly speaks a word. Shows no sign of life. I... Come in! It's a cable, sir, from Shanghai, for the Assistant Commissioner. Very well. I'll take it, then. Is there anything I can do to help? Oh, yes. I'd be very grateful if you'd come with me and see him. - Well, of course. - Fine. I have a car waiting outside. I really am most worried about him. My God! I've been here for a week already. You promised me news. I've heard nothing. You will be patient. Word has reached us from London this very day. Within this palace, we have a modern receiving and sending system. "Last night, in London, "Assistant Commissioner Nayland Smith, of Scotland Yard, "was arrested for murder." - Impossible! - But, nonetheless, true. There is also a second message. "Assistant Commissioner Nayland Smith "left for Shanghai this morning, by sea." Sorry, I don't understand. I will explain. This is Dr Lieberson, one of the world's great surgeons. It was he who created the false Nayland Smith, who will assuredly be tried, condemned, and hanged. Thus, with their chief discredited, we shall have achieved our first victory over Scotland Yard. And on the day of the execution, my followers all over the world will rise united in their strength and power. What about the real Nayland Smith? He will arrive here shortly. A man without a name. Without a country. He will be presented with a simple choice. He can either become my servant, and assist me in my plans, or he can die beneath the executioner's sword. But, before he dies, he will endure the agony of knowing that, in the eyes of the world, he is already dead. Convicted, and executed, as a murderer. My compliments. However, the doctor's work has onlyjust begun. Our next objective is the Austrian police, a certain Kommissar Strauss. Already, my daughter has been looking for a suitable replacement. Ah, yes! The doctor's daughter, Maria. His Achilles heel. Last time, Lin Tang persuaded the doctor to change his mind. Perhaps, on the next occasion, you would prefer the privilege? It would be a pleasure. Very well, take them away. You know, Weston, I still can't believe that Nayland Smith is in Wandsworth Prison, awaiting his trial on a charge of murder. The only thing I can say is how sorry I am. But the police case seems so conclusive. Well, that's the damnable part of it. And he wouldn't even protest his innocence. I hope to heaven he changes his mind at the trial. No, no, there's only one alternative. We'll have to plead insanity. But the trouble is to get the medical evidence to prove it. What about yourself? You're a doctor. You know very well I'd swear my life away to save his. The pity of it all is that I... I can't do any good. Everyone knows I'm his best friend. Look, look, you wouldn't appeal to him, would you? Perhaps he'd take your advice. Send him a note, and tell him to do as I ask. - Very well. - Look, I... Great Scott! I'd forgotten all about this. This is the cable that came for Nayland Smith at Scotland Yard. You remember? "Moss presumed bound for Kwang Su province, "to meet man who seeks world domination. "Inspector Ramos, Shanghai Police." World domination? That means Fu Manchu. Well, if Fu Manchu is alive, from what you tell me, the one thing in the world he most desires - is to destroy Nayland Smith. - Right. Doctor, I must leave for China at once. There's a flying boat leaves for Hong Kong tonight. I could be in Shanghai in ten days' time. Ten days, and Nayland Smith's trial starts tomorrow. Denis Nayland Smith, you stand charged upon this indictment that, upon the third of March of this year, you did feloniously, wilfully and with your malice aforethought, kill and murder Jasmin Fu Shen. How say you? Are you guilty, or not guilty? Prisoner in the dock. Do you plead guilty, or not guilty? Enter a plea of "not guilty". May it please your Lordship, members of the jury, I must admit to a feeling of sadness as I open this case against the distinguished prisoner who stands before you. However, my personal feeling can play no part in the role I have to perform. It is my duty to demand of you a verdict of guilty. The prisoner stands charged with the murder of a young Chinese girl in his employment, who was known as Jasmin. I am convinced that you will be satisfied, from the evidence to be produced, that the prisoner is guilty of the crime with which he is charged. I shall now adduce evidence as to the cause of death. Members of the jury, you have heard that a plea of insanity has been entered on behalf of the accused. This has been influenced more by the friends of the accused than by the accused's own desires. The medical evidence which I shall call for you, is the best that is available. The witnesses to the accused's previous character are men of integrity and distinction. Call Dr Petrie. I swear by Almighty God that the evidence I shall give, shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God. My Lord, I now propose to call the accused, from whom, so far, I've had little cooperation. Will you take the stand, please? Take the book in your right hand, and read the words on the card. That's all right, Mr Healey. Now, Mr Nayland Smith, please tell the court, in your own words, exactly what happened. If you will not answer your counsel's questions, he will not be able to help you. Remember, your life is at stake. I must ask you to answer my questions. My Lord, I really must suggest that this performance be brought to an end. It is clear that the accused has no intention of answering his own counsel's questions. How much less chance is there of his answering mine? Stand down the accused. You find Nayland Smith guilty of murder. And that is the verdict of you all? It is, my Lord. Nayland Smith, you stand convicted of the wilful murder of Jasmin Fu Shen. Have you anything to say as to reason why the court should not pass sentence of death according to law? Denis Nayland Smith, you have been found guilty of that crime for which the law appoints one sentence, and one sentence only. It is that sentence which I now propose to pass on you. It is that you be taken from hence to a place of lawful execution, and you be there hanged by the neck until you be dead. And that your body afterwards be buried within the precincts of the prison, in which you shall last have been confined. And may the Lord have mercy on your soul. Rise. - Speak. - Father, good news from London. In three weeks, Nayland Smith will hang. And the news from Shanghai? The ship has docked, and the consignment has been put ashore. - He is still alive? - Yes. He will be brought here, by the secret route, and should arrive in two weeks. When we pass the next village, we shall enter the province of Kwang Su. And how much further do we have to go after that? Beyond those mountains over there lies the palace of Fu Manchu. - Do you think we're being followed? - No. The Shanghai police cannot touch us here. Don't worry, darling. Everything will be all right, okay? Come in. Mr Weston, sir. - Mr Weston. - Pleased to meet you, Inspector. - I trust you had a good journey? - Very good, thanks. - Please, be seated. - Thank you. I'm afraid that I've just received some bad news from Dr Petrie. Nayland Smith's appeal has been rejected. Oh, no. Tell me, Inspector, how long would it take us to reach the Kwang Su province? At least two weeks. But surely you know that an earthquake has cut off all communication from the province to the outside world? Yeah, but there must be some way. Perhaps. Some of my colleagues know China like the back of their hand. Or maybe just a few of us could get through in time. You forget one thing. We are members of the International Police Force. We have no jurisdiction outside Shanghai. In fact, I am not even allowed to wear my uniform inside China itself. I appreciate that, Inspector, but for the sake of Nayland Smith, I'd like to have a go. - I'll ask for volunteers. - Thanks. To look at that motley crowd, you wouldn't think that they are the finest men in the International Police, would you? Let's hope their disguise is as good as you say. How much further do we have to go? Another six days' journey beyond those mountains. Well, today's the 24th. The execution takes place on the 30th. Let's go. Come on! Hey, what are you doing here? You know these people? Yes. The girl's mine. The man works for me, or, better, used to work for me. - Used to work for you? - Mm-hmm. I have no further use for this idiot. Shut your big mouth! Stop! Take him away. What's going to happen to him? It does not concern you. He has been good to me on the journey. He mustn't be harmed. We will hold him safe. He will not be harmed... yet. He may be useful. All right. You and your friends have paid the penalty for that little trick. Unless you want to join them in hell, you'll guide us for the rest of the way to the palace of Fu Manchu. Mount up! How much longer do we have to stay in this dreadful place? Until Fu Manchu can tell me the first stage of his operations has succeeded. And then? Criminals all over the world will be convinced, and accept Fu Manchu, beyond question, as their leader. The time has come for the second experiment. Daughter, do we have yet a candidate to replace Kommissar Strauss? Yes, Father. Chances have brought us the very man. His physical characteristics are identical, and, in Dr Lieberson's hands, I'm sure the transformation can be made. Bring him here. What... What are they going to do to him? He has a most important part to play. He will be suitably rewarded. You mean you'll make him a murderer, like the other one, and then have him hanged. Oh, Rudy, you've got to stop them! I have a feeling your friendship is a little deeper than I first believed. You bastard! He's all yours. Do with him what you want. That was my intention. You have the documents concerning Kommissar Strauss? Yes, Father. Then you will proceed with the operation, Doctor. I will not. I see. In that case, Dr Lieberson's daughter shall be handed over to you. I shall expect to hear from you by tomorrow, without fail, that the good doctor is ready to continue with his work. The palace of Fu Manchu? We meet again. What do you hope to gain from this? A certain personal satisfaction, Commissioner. Also the pleasure of giving you the choice of joining my organisation, or of meeting the fate that you have so often planned for me. Fu Manchu already knows my answer. In that case, Nayland Smith has but five days to live. You must be Nayland Smith. How do you know my name? Dr Lieberson. I'm a surgeon. My daughter, Ingar Svensson. I know your name, of course. Why are you here? I must tell you. I know you from your photographs. Fu Manchu forced me to create a facsimile of you. And now he wants to transform Kurt, the man in the next cell, into another impostor, a Kommissar in the Vienna police. - Kommissar Strauss? - Yes. That was his name. He plans to eliminate police chiefs all over the world, one by one, and have their impostors commit murder. So that's what he meant, when he said that "Nayland Smith has but five days to live". Yes. He's only waiting for the news from London, that the impostor has been executed. And then, unknown to the rest of the world, he will kill the real Nayland Smith. No, I'm sorry, Doctor, there's nothing I can do. If he refuses to speak to you, I cannot accede to your request. Well, couldn't I just see him, even if he does refuse to speak to me? I'm afraid not. Believe me, this is one of the most painful tasks I've ever been called upon to carry out. We... We've only got forty-eight hours. Yes, Doctor, but there's absolutely nothing I can do. What kind of a fool are you? You know it's only up to you. Either you carry out this second operation, or... Come on, Doctor, don't be a hero. All right, put him in. Ssh! Quick! Over there! Over the wall! Maria... Maria! No, Father! Perhaps it would encourage you to cooperate if others suffer. Bring the other girl! No! No, let me go! Get his clothes off. You're a very stupid girl. Ah! Bring her down. And be quick! Let's see what's going to happen to her. Stand back! Come on, get them! Come on, you son of a bitch! Do the other one. - All right? - Maria! Come on, we must move! It is my duty to inform you that the law must now take its course. Your prisoner, sir. When the last grain of sand has gone, it will be eight o'clock in the morning in London, and the false Nayland Smith will be dead. At the same precise moment, the real Nayland Smith will also die. "...cut down, like a flower. "He fleeth as it were a shadow, "and never continueth in one stay. "In the midst of life, we are in death. "Of whom may we seek for succour, "but of thee, O Lord, who for our sins art justly displeased? "Yet, O Lord God most holy, O Lord most mighty..." "Forasmuch as it hath pleased Almighty God of his great mercy "to take unto himself the soul of our dear brother here departed, "we therefore commit his body to the ground, "earth to earth, ashes to ashes, "dust to dust, "in sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life "through our Lord Jesus Christ, "who shall change our vile body "that it may be like unto his glorious body, "according to the mighty working, "whereby he is able to subdue all things to himself. "Lord, have mercy upon us. "Christ, have mercy upon us. "Lord, have mercy upon us." Vengeance is mine. Bring forth Nayland Smith. Now, my vengeance is complete. Kill! Not this time, Fu Manchu. Seize them! Quick, before it explodes! Move! Quickly! Quickly, this way! We have horses! There goes the last of Fu Manchu's palace. But not the last, I fear, of Fu Manchu. The world will hear from me again. SUBTITLES BY POWERHOUSE FILMS LTD
