BANK VAULT What's going on? General Bank, alert! Rescue squad! General Bank, alert! -Rescue squad, alert! -General Bank! Urgent transmission: Toulouse-Pyrenees, Radio Normandy. What's this? -General de Gaulle. -Oh! There is another incident. The series is continuing… Gentlemen, to recap: In three months, we've had: the Meyer jewelry store robbery, the theft of gold bars from the Comptoir Brésilien, the broad daylight attack on the Château du Plessis, and last night, half a million securities at the General Bank. And what have you brought me? Two contradictory reports, not a single fingerprint, tracks that criss-cross and become a jumble. The chief of police was angered… by what he calls your failing. I won't hide that, for some of you, it'll be a matter of… a transfer, even sackings. Yes, well, getting back to last night's theft… I am convinced that it was committed by this mysterious character that the newspapers already call "Monsieur Personne." And another stronger conviction, but again, the three previous robberies are also by Monsieur Personne. What? Is there something you want to tell me? Chief, may I point out that every burglar works -according to a certain method. -So? But the robberies you have just mentioned show completely different tactics. Yes, I know. That's where you're wrong. If all these incidents happened in different ways, I affirm that they were all committed by the same person. Haven't you noticed that they all have the same meticulous preparation? The same audacity? Have you? No, no, believe me, we are dealing with one guy. And a first-rate one at that. Let's see, gentlemen… I'm going to give you a difficult mission… -You read the newspaper? -Oh… -It's a real move, Josette! -You know me. I love moving. See to the chairs. -Yes, ma'am. -Thank you. Ah, yes, three of them. Very good. Do you think it's useful, what we're doing here? It's essential. I absolutely want to take every precaution. Good, good. Good, good. Don't you think our friend is a bit… No, I've never known her otherwise. -It's heavy. -Do you want me to help you? No, no, wait. -Push the tables over here. -OK, got it. Oh, Myriam, don't forget the big window. Got it! -Say, Josette. -Huh? -Have you seen the newspapers? -No, I haven't. Oh, I think it's fantastic. -Unheard of! Ah, it's amazing! -Let's not get worked up, my man! What's up? What's got you excited? Have you seen this? "Monsieur Personne returned some of the securities he had stolen to the director of the General Bank." -He returned the securities? -Yes, but only those whose value had fallen too far. -Wow, that's fantastic! -The cynicism of this individual is outrageous. Yes, but he's not a real star, is he? Oh, no! I must admit I don't understand you. Yes, well, then… I don't know. You're from another era. That's not possible. But I find it amazing, eh? That's what I call a man! Ah! Well, well, that's fine, like that. -No, no, wait, wait. -What's going on? Before we seal the doors, we have to go get the curtains. Ah, you see, we're forgetting the main thing… Tell me, old Perrier, who are these people you introduced me to earlier? They are old friends of mine, the Dariers. Well, I dared to-- -Well, you did the right thing! -Thank you. I'll do the lighting test now. Are you coming? Hey, aren't you afraid there's too much light? If we have it too dark, he'll say it's a trick. Ah, but we must convince this gentleman. -Have you ever seen him? -Who is he? Well, your skeptic, the Count of Trégunc. No. No, he wrote me a letter. Oh, a very funny one, you see, in which he says that he would be curious to attend my seance, adding that he would show me that I was a victim of hallucinations… Is your Mr. de Trégunc young or old? Oh, well, you know, that's the least of my worries, with what I'll do to him. Ah, someone rang. It must be him. Philippe! What are you doing here at this hour? I came back from the theater with friends, saw the light in your living room, -so I let myself… -Well, you were right to. Would you allow me to introduce to you Ms. Geneviève Rivers, Ms. Marguette Henry, Mr. Maurice Cardis. Welcome! Tell me, do you believe in spirits? You're going to tell me again that Bonaparte has come to propose to you. Oh, no, please! Or that the end table revealed that you are Joan of Arc. Philippe, don't joke with the spirits. -I want to convince you, too. -Hmm! Sorry. Do you mind? Please. What time is it? -The time? -Yes. -About midnight. -That's good. I feared I might be late. -Who must I say? -Mr. de Trégunc. You see, they are expecting me. My respects, dear ma'am. -Excuse my boldness. -But please do. I know that your séances are very sincere, but I just need convincing. -I thank you for coming. -I'm very grateful. Perrier? Do me a favor, will you? -Make the introductions for me. -Of course. Count de Trégunc, Mr. Francis Perrier. Nice to meet you. -Myriam? -Yes? You can bring in the bridge players next door. And seal the door right away. I'll close the last exit myself. -Philippe, would you like to help me? -Yes, certainly. What's she doing? Excuse me, ma'am. Could I possibly ask you what you are doing? But you see, my dear sir, I'm closing the last exit. The… last exit? Yes, because the door to my boudoir has been closed as well. Yes, and the two windows. Ah. That's… and why is that? Why is that? So that you can be sure that no human intervention is coming in from outside! Ah, very good, very good. Well done. Now, we'll sit around the table. All right. Here, you see… this lamp alone will remain lit. And that way, during the whole session, you'll be free to walk around, to watch us, even… Very impressive. Very, very… all the more impressive because I hate the dark. Ah, since I was a child. -Perrier, would you turn off the light? -Yes, of course. Jean, stop stealing from the buffet. Oh, how stupid! It's just a little accident. Let's not panic! Hands up! Nobody move! Back into the corner. Back up, come on! Into the corner! Come on, faster! Or I'll shoot! It was scary… that gunshot! -Nobody is hurt? -Who took my watch? Oh, no! But the doors and windows are still sealed! So, he couldn't get out! Oh, it's terrible. He is still in this room… Oh, this can't be happening! And he stole my diamond brooch! No… What? What's wrong? I'm scared to death. Ah, here's an interesting clue. Don't touch! Look, don't get upset. Please, stay calm. We'll call the police. -Do you have a phone? -Yes, I'll get it. Oh, excuse me, ma'am. That's interesting. And do you know the number of police headquarters? Oh, no. I'd like to know that, of course. Very interesting… Hello, miss. Quai des Orfèvres, please. Yes, yes, I'm noting it. I'm noting it. It's indeed, indeed very surprising… I'll do what needs to be done right away. But above all, don't touch anything until the inspectors arrive. That's right. Marchand! Yes? Come here a moment. An interesting case, Marchand. Armed jewelry robbery. And if what they told me on the phone is true, it's a master stroke. One for you, who likes hard cases… -Any clues? -None. We need a thorough search and a general search. Here's the name and address. Take a colleague with you, OK? I'll get you a search and seizure. -Meet me downstairs in the courtyard. -Thank you. -Hello. -Come on, come over here, you. Hello, yes? Come on, get Henriette and René down here. Right away. Marchand is waiting down in the courtyard. Stay at the door and only let me out on my order, OK? Got it. Police. -Madame Josette Verneau. -Yes? -Only, she has guests. I don't know if… -Would you call her? -Yes, sir. -Go tell her. -Yes, sir. -Stay here, please. Paul, don't touch the door. -There are some gentlemen here who… -Yes, yes, I know. Are you locked in? Yes and no… That is, it's sealed on this side, and I would prefer that… -Inspector Marchand. -Yes, I was expecting you. Could you tell me exactly what happened? Well, Inspector, we were all sitting -around this table-- -Excuse me, I haven't asked you. A black-gloved hand… He snatched my brooch! If you all talk at once, you won't know anything. My watch… oh, sorry. May we speak a few minutes in private? Oh, yes. Tell me, Paul, you… you didn't hear anything, did you? No, ma'am. -Why? -Come with us. Mr. Trégunc, what do you think? Oh, I can't see… Only the police can know. In any case, that's a fact! We know one of us is a thief! Ah, that's a fact, yes. And nobody could get out! -Ah, but why not? -How do you mean, "why not"? Well, yes… There was perhaps an end table with a thieving spirit. Came in through the chimney. It could get out through the keyhole. Oh, it's very bad to joke about it. You don't want me to cry because my watch was stolen, do you? -Of course not… -Right? -Besides, nothing was stolen from you… -No, nothing. But why wasn't anything stolen from you? OK. You can leave now. Yes, sir. -That door there? -That door leads to my boudoir. Oh, yes… was the lamp there? Yes. Perfect, perfect. There are no bullet holes, neither in the ceiling nor in the walls… Nowhere, period. Blank cartridge, ma'am. -Simon? -Yes? Come here. Save it for the identification line-up. Got it. Have Henriette and René sent over. All right. I'm sorry, but I have to search everyone. Search everyone? But that's inconceivable! I… I'll answer for my friends! Would you prefer that I leave? No, I mean… -Is it really necessary? -It is. Ladies, I'll ask you to step aside. As for you, gentlemen, follow me. Gentlemen, would you please stand in a row. Oh, good, good. We're in the army now. René, you can start at the bench. OK. Your turn, miss. -Nothing. -Have you looked in the lining? There's nothing, Inspector. -Sir, please continue. -Yes, sir. -What is your first and last name? -Philippe Beauvoir. -Profession? -Architect. -Address? -11 bis, Avenue Henry Martin. -I lost a signet ring… -That's all? If you think that's not enough… -It's OK. Let him go. -All right. If someone had told me one day that a man would feel me up… If my ancestors could see me! Turn around, sir. And I have to turn around again! Miss, miss! Where are you going? Stay here, please. -Anything? -Nothing. Your last name, first name, and title? Paul Perrier, industrialist. 5, Allée de la Muette. -Nothing was stolen from you? -No. Oh, that's… surely an oversight. You'll find me again, turning tables over. -It's all right. Let him go. -Yes. Thank you, Inspector, thank you. Thank you. Thank you, miss. Is it because I'm the second to last that you're treating me so well, sir? -Open your vest, sir. -I don't have to take orders from you. What the… OK, OK. -If you don't mind, I… -You could have put gloves on to touch… -What the… you want the vest. -There you go, sir. -It's open. -What's this? They are suspenders. Haven't you ever seen suspenders? Your pants are held up with string, no doubt. -I'm not here to joke. -Nor am I, sir. Let's get down to business, please. Nothing. Your name, sir? Well, give your name. We're asking you. -No, you, sir. We're asking you… -Huh? Ah, my name? Count de Trégunc… with a C. Direct descendant of the Dukes of Normandy from the younger branch. I don't have my family tree with me, but if you want, I can get it. -Doesn't ring a bell? No. OK, then. -Home? See? -Home? -Never put the button… home… 40, Avenue Elisée Reclus. The house is mine. I inherited it from my father. Now, I'm the only son. That's it. Can I help you find my watch, my friend? -What watch? -My watch. Because I was robbed. Would you please write this? I was robbed, sir. Mr. de Trégunc, you are free. Thank you. You are very kind. I am free, sir. Thank you, miss. Ma'am, the police are merciless. I would have liked to give my respects to Madame Verneau, unfortunately… Ma'am! Your name and address, please? Myriam de Martel, 12, Rue de l'Étoile. Your name and address? Jean du Menil. 11, Avenue de la Grande Armée. Excuse me interrupting, but I still have something to say to you… -I'm listening, sir. -I wish you a good night! -Oh, how kind. -Oh, well, excuse me! -Too kind. -Good night! Well, Inspector? Nothing yet, Madame Verneau. Do you know all the people who were at your house last night well? Oh, almost all of them… And the ones I don't know are friends of my friends. I'm taking the exhibits with me, and if we find fingerprints tomorrow, your guests will be subjected to a line-up. I will ask you now to leave us alone because the search is beginning. Yes, of course. -Through the window, Thibault. -Yes. It's still strange. Oh, it doesn't surprise me. Searching ordinary people's homes never turns up anything. Ah, I get it. The guest at the Marquis de Beauchamp's hunt. Yes. Well, tell him that the director of my conscience forbids me to kill animals. -Very well. -Here we are. The trainer asks if he can enter Royal Legend in the Fall Grand Prix. No, no, no, she has won enough. You are requested to attend the wedding ceremony of Baron Veri. Oh, is that so? And who's that idiot marrying? -His first cousin. -Oh, his cousin? That's not going to raise the intellectual level of the family. -Well, is that all? -There's a letter of mourning. Oh, don't open it, please… It won't do any good. When there's a death, it's over, right? I'm going to answer all this mail. Yes. Don't misuse my signature. Your Lordship… My Lord doesn't need me any more? No. Send Germain to me, will you? Yes, sir. A little physical training… …in flexibility. First movement. Extend your arms sideways. Flex the forearm. Rotate the head. Ouch… oh, that's too hard. -Bend the knee. -Ah. Yes, I like that. Ah! And do this exercise ten times in a row. No, no, that's enough, thank you. -Stretch your arms sideways. -You'll feel better after. Your Lordship has asked for me? Yes, I need the car at three o'clock. I… am free this morning, my Lord? -If you wish. -Thank you, sir. If my Lord would like to come in… I am surprised to see you at home. -Why not? Please, sit down. -I came to get some news. -News? -Yes, do you have any news? -Oh, about the incident last night? -Yes. Well, the papers think this new crime is Monsieur Personne. They only lend to the rich. No, I've come especially to apologize. -Apologize? For what, my God? -Yes. -Everything is my fault… -Your fault? You organized the séance for me, didn't you? -Oh, yes, that's right. -So… -You must have slept very badly… -Me? Ah, you're wrong. I love emotions! No! Well, you got what you like, then… Oh, yes. No, I don't know… I thought you were hit hard, devastated… Yet… you haven't a worry. Not really. I wouldn't give up last night for half my fortune. Let's not go overboard. No, if you ask me… I don't find anything sensational in what that gentleman did. If it is him, that is. Only he could have such audacity. Audacity is saying a lot… Between us, you know, Fantomas and Arsène Lupin were of a different class. Ah, I don't agree with you. Ah, you find it difficult to knock over a lamp, to put people in the dark? To take their jewelry at gunpoint? But the worst gangster can do that. Don't you think so? Now, keeping jewelry in your pocket until the… police come… I don't think that's extraordinary. And slipping them into the pocket of a policeman's overcoat… it's not magic. Ah, taking them back… taking them back once the search is finished, I admit that it is a little trickier because you have to slit… because… you have to cut the pocket with a little knife, so… inevitably, there's… there's a trick… It seems to me. Yes… Well, that's all part of the job. Mr. Perrier on the phone, ma'am. OK, fine. Do you mind? Of course. Thank you for your time. Thank you. Hello? Yes? Oh, what did you say? Oh, no, how… that's crazy! Wait for me. I'll come see you right away. -Excuse me, I have to go. -What is it? What's going on? Oh, nothing… -You seem distraught. What's the matter? -Well, you… -Huh? -You were right. What? Inspector Marchand's pocket was cut with a knife. Oh, what did I tell you? It's crazy! I have these hunches! You're troubled, aren't you? You're angry. I shouldn't have told you all those stories… Will you forgive me? -Of course. -Yes, well, say that… more nicely. Hmm? You only have to smile. Give me a smile. I need a smile. A smile, come on. Is it a rose? Ah! You're giving me a rose. I love roses. Ouch! Ouch, great. Shouldn't have touched it. Mr. de Trégunc, I must go. No, I wanted to thank you… You must admit that for your debut against Monsieur Personne, you had bad luck. But… you don't leave your raincoat in a room where you're searching, come on. Anyway. Let's not talk about it anymore. What do you think of the Josette Verneau robbery? Chief, it may seem paradoxical, but it's all the trickier because there's only one possible hypothesis. The thief must be one of Josette Verneau's guests. Your enquiry is getting simpler. Ah, on the contrary, Chief. That's where the difficulty begins, because none of her guests is suspect. According to the archives, we are dealing with high-status individuals, and we have first-class information. Listen, Marchand, we can't leave it at that. In any case, you've seen this Monsieur Personne. You even searched him, you questioned him. Yes. Monsieur Personne is… he's nobody, and he's everybody. Hello, yes? Ah, yes, Josette Verneau. This is forensic anthropometry. Yes? Well… good job. Very good. "No prints on the objects seized by Inspector Marchand." This is where we are. Ma'am! Ma'am! What is it? The glass is broken… The curtain is torn! -What are you saying? -You must look. -Should we call the police? -We have to call right away. Clémence… Clémence, bring me the phone. I'll make the call myself. Thank you. Clémence… Promise you won't mention what you just saw. Yes, ma'am. -Can I count on you? Thank you. -Yes, ma'am. DISCRETIO VERITAS AGENCY - INVESTIGATION - TAILING - BUILDING SECURITY Miss, I have an appointment at 10:30 a.m. with the agency's director. Would you like to sit down, ma'am? My husband will see you right away. It's your 10:30 appointment. Ah, good, dear. You can let her in. You can come in, ma'am. Hello. -Hello, Germain. -Are you alone? My husband is busy. Oh, that's lucky. Shh… shut up. You know that the doors are padded. Yes, but here, you know, the walls have ears. Hey, you don't write often. What are you talking about? But I wrote you again this morning. -Liar. -Liar? -And what's this? -Give it to me. First of all, take back "liar." You're a sweetheart. Come on, give it. As I was not sure I'd find you alone, I had written you a little letter. You can leave without worry, ma'am. Your property will be guarded in your absence. Our guards are very reliable, and their rounds are very thorough. I am thinking of leaving for a month. You must just tell me when you're back. -Is that 500 francs, sir? -That's right, ma'am. Hello? Make out a receipt for 500 francs to Madame Geoffroy. Yes. Go sit down, quickly, over there. Hurry up. -Have you got the receipt? -One second. -Ah, hello, Germain. -Hello. I have… I have a woman in my office who has come to entrust me with a case that might interest you. What kind of case? An open-and-shut case. Burglary in a house I'm watching while the owners are away. -I'll see you in a moment. -Yes, yes, thank you. -Will I see you soon? -Not right away. You know I'm leaving tonight for a big deal in the South. You stay. Your husband will give me the final details. I'm not wishing you good luck. When I come back, see to it you have a day off. Yes! Hello? All right, then. You can go in. All right. Come on in, that's it! Come on, sit down. Ah… Germain! I'm spoiling you! This is the second part of the Josette Verneau case. Oh, by the way, was the jewel robbery last week satisfactory? Oh, yes. A small matter. Yes, well, the second part is going to be a bit more challenging. Here. Check this out. You can judge for yourself. "Charles Préval, attorney at law at the Domestic Trade Bank, will take the train tonight at 8:14 p.m. from PLM Station, bound for Fougues, three stations before Antibes. He will carry 600,000 francs in cash. He must give it to Madame Josette Verneau, so that she can pay the notary in Fougues the price of the land she has just bought." Your second episode is perfect. But what about the third? Oh, well, it's even better. "And at the same notary in Fougues, Mr. Monin has just been paid the other allocations related to parceling of said land." Now, I… For this third case, I cannot give you any other instructions. -It's up to you to work it out there. -You can count on me. Now, for all three cases… -You'll get your usual commission. -Oh, well, OK. Tell me, at your man's place, your notary in Fougues… How big is the deposit? -A little over a million. -Oh, you take good care of me! But you're forgetting the main thing. The description of Charles Préval. Well… you're a kid. I can improve on his description! His photograph. And I have several more copies. -One is enough for me, you know. -Here you are. Here it is. Isn't he handsome? You can't ask it all of him! His money… he must be good-looking next to it all. Ah, I'm off. We have nothing more to say to each other? -Well, you'll telegraph me? -Oh, well, no need. You'll see your news in the papers. It's still our best telegram. -Well, goodbye, Bibi! -Goodbye. Ah, not there. There should be someone. Go this way. -Well, goodbye, old man. -Goodbye. What are you hiding? Nothing. I don't buy that! I saw you put something in your bag. -It's nothing. It's a bill. -Then show me. Show it to me! Usually, I'm the one paying the bills! Who wrote you this crap? -You don't know him. -Oh, I don't know him? You slut. How long has this affair been going on? Well, answer me! Oh, you've both made a fool of me. Ah… He didn't even have the decency to forge his handwriting. How long ago did you get your tax? -Well, answer me! -Listen to me… Oh, we start to find out as soon as it's over. Your voice is hurting me! -But I can assure you-- -Oh, shut up, or I'll hit you! Ah, it's OK… I'll get you back for it! -What are you going to do? -Oh, what am I going to do? Oh, you'd like to know what I'm going to do, huh? I don't give a damn about your Germain. You won't see him again so soon. Oh, my girl… the belt! Do you understand? You'll be able to go away for a bit! Bitch! POLICE HEADQUARTERS Ah. Look… suitcase number four… Pass me what's in locker three and locker six. -Right. The mask… -The mask. The mask and this… -Gun? -Oh, yes, the 6- and the 8-mm. -We'll take the detectors? -I think so. The main one, you think. Yes, that one. Here you go. -I had the business cards made. -Ah, you're perfect. So, give me one, and you can keep the rest. -Yes. -That's it… there we go. I don't think I forgot anything… did I? -So, get my things ready, will you? -Yes. Go on. Uh… Hello? Yes, yes. Don't worry about it. Yes, yes. You're right. The trip is becoming impossible. Thank you. What about my stuff? You can't leave tonight. What's to stop me? Charles Préval, who's carrying the 600,000 francs, will probably be escorted. -What's that? -The station and train will be watched. -Well, well. -All this, by the way, is my fault. -It's your fault? -Berthe just called me. Her husband discovered our affair. Jealous as hell, he's given us away. This is frightening. You think that… that life isn't complicated enough, with your affairs? Really smart, getting caught. Do my suitcase. But you're not leaving, not after what I told you! What time is my train? -8:14 p.m. -Go get me a ticket for Fougues. And ask around, I think we change at Aix-en-Provence. -But you can't leave… -Shut up, shut up… Nothing will happen to me if you're right at kilometer marker 409. Here, set your watch. Like mine. -That's it. -Good. Here… -Did you take care of the second car? -Yes. At 1:04 a.m., my train goes past -kilometer marker 409. Write that down. -OK. All this must happen mathematically. You see, when you reach Rouvière… Give me the picture. So, what's your decision? -What? -I'm going with you? Oh, no, my man. To pull off a job like this, you have to be alone. Especially when it comes to Monsieur Personne… Don't move. There he is. Who? Charles Préval. Goodbye, old boy. SLEEPER CAR SLEEPER CAR Oh my God… What's going on? Open up, open up! Oh, they've jammed the signal! The emergency lights aren't working either? All the fuses are blown. We're fixing them. Let me through. The lights are back on. There, the light is back on. Absolutely! That's good! -What's that? -Inspector Marchand. An incident has occurred. The signal has been jammed-- Yes, I thought so, thought so. Tell me, what is the next station? It is Saint Durieux, five kilometers away. Well, then, not a minute to lose. Let's go right away. When we get to Saint Durieux, you'll slow the train down, and I'll get off. In the train, please. Block all the roads. Make this roadblock effective for a radius of 100 miles. Stop all cars. Report: large pipe, dark interior. The victim being searched for is a man named Préval. The amount of the theft is 5,000 francs. Telephone all results to the gendarmerie in Fougues. That is all. Thank you. Thank you for your help. Is this a crime, Inspector? Where can we find a car in the area? A car? Oh, there are none around here. You'll have to walk at least 12 kilometers. What about the next train? -At what time? -At 8:15 a.m., Inspector. Ah! It's 1:35 a.m. -Would you like to have something? -No, no, thank you, thank you. You're no longer needed. You can go to bed. I'll keep watch. Yes, Inspector. -Hi. -Hello. Is the car ready? All set. All that's left is to leave. Here are the instructions for the packet -that's in the car. -Ah. OK. -Nothing to report? I'm off. -Nothing, old man. Bye. Your papers, please? Thank you, sir. You can go through. -Your papers. -Here you are. -Where are you coming from? -Paris. -Where are you going? -Marseille. OK, thanks. Go through. ECLIPSE WAX ECLIPSES ALL WAXES -My Lord. -Ah, sorry. -Did my Lord have a good trip? -Oh, no! No, a nasty trip. I hate the local trains. It's no fun when you stop at all the stations… and night travel doesn't suit me at all. So, Germain, -did it go well? -Yes. -And your prisoner? -He's a perfect man. -Yes? -Hah! -What time did he wake up? -He didn't. What do you mean? He's dead? Oh, no, my Lord… As we agreed, I took him to Alfred's. He was still fast asleep. He'll wake up surprised to find himself fishing by a river. You're a genius. -And the notary? -It's done. He has your letter. -He has my letter? Great. -Yes. How far to Madame Verneau's property? Eight kilometers from the station. A beautiful house, perfectly isolated. -Isolated? Beautiful. -Yes. So far, it has happened like clockwork. We've tackled the… the difficult thing. You didn't notice that the local police were alerted, did you? -No. -No. Well, I'll give you my instructions 24 hours in advance. About 200 meters from here, past the turn, you'll see the property. In 15 minutes, I'll be there. Time enough to get in disguise. Yes, don't forget the business cards. Oh, I remember! As soon as you give him the money, make him sign a receipt. See you soon! I'll meet you later. Those who breathe this gas can be assured a great sleep. Come on, hurry up. OK, I'm ready. You're my teacher! -Ah, there! -I think it's hot. Ah, Paul! Why don't you serve us two Marie Brizards? No, let me pick up your ball, will you? Please, I'm the youngest! The youngest… How nice of you to remind me. -You're welcome. Ready? -Yes. Here… here! And then when we've finished the game, well, we can go pick hazelnuts! They're not ready yet. Ma'am, I've brought a gentleman into the smoking room who wishes to see you. Ah, who is he? -He gave me his card. -Yes, read it. Charles Préval, authorized representative of the Foreign Trade Bank. Ah, yes. Indeed, I was expecting this gentleman. -Tell him I'll be right over. -Good. Here, ma'am, are the 600,000 francs debited from your account. Ah, very good. One, two, three, -four, five, six. -Thank you. Would you please sign the release receipt? Yes. I apologize for making you make this long trip, but our Fougues notary is haunted by an old woman who demands payment in cash. Yes, he wants nothing to do with checks. In the countryside, this frequently happens, ma'am. It does? Well, all the same, nowadays… -Here's your receipt. -Thank you. Pardon me. Are you taking the midday train? -Would you like to take something? -Thank you. I was told there was a Roman aqueduct nearby, and I love archaeology. My respects, ma'am. Oh, please, don't bother. Come in. Madame… there's a gentleman in the living room who wishes to speak to you. Did he tell you his name? No, ma'am. He told me he was a friend of yours. -Ah, that's fine. I'll go and see him. -All right. No. She must be doing it on purpose… What carelessness… -Paul? -Ma'am? -You said someone wanted to see me? -Yes, ma'am. -Well, then, where is this gentleman? -He's there, in the hall. Oh? Excuse me… I was going to light a cigarette. What? You, in Fougues? Me in Fougues? Yes, yes. I love surprises. -Ah, yes, indeed, this is a surprise. -It is. Now, I don't interfere but really, it's not wise to leave money lying around on a table like that when all the doors are open. -You can walk right in here. -Yes, you're right. -Excuse me. I'll put this away. -Please, take your time. I'm not offering to help you because… paper is light! Are you passing by? Ah, you found the word! "Passing by," exactly. Every year, I spend my vacations on the French Riviera. -Vacation? -My vacation, yes. Can't I take a vacation like everyone else? -Of course. -Yes? Well, that's nice. What's even nicer is the detour I made to kiss your hand. There was a bit of curiosity, because I'll tell you everything. I would like to know why you left Paris so suddenly. -Why did I leave Paris? -Yes, I'd like to know. Because of you. In what way because of me? Are you joking? -No, no. -No, you're joking. I left Paris not to see you again. -To not… why? -Hmm? Did I do something to upset you or something? You scare me. Oh, is it a physical thing? You don't like my nose. -Excuse me, I'm very nervous. -You can't please everyone… Oh, no, now you've said too much. So, just say it now! I want to know. Well, there are moments when I wonder if you are really the Count de Trégunc. What? That's a new one. What proof would you like? Do you want me to show you my army booklet? My driver's license? I don't know… Damn, all these stories have got your head spinning… Monsieur Personne… I bet you think that's who I am! I bet! Hm? There we go, that's it. But no, no, no. Now it's very clear in my mind… It's stupid. The other day I abandoned my common sense to explain how Monsieur Personne could have done it, and then, from there to suppose that I was Monsieur Personne, there was only one step, obviously… If I'd have thought for one minute… But in the end, can you explain to me the stolen rose? What stolen rose? And in its place… the diamond clip. -The stolen rose… I don't understand. -And the clip? Ah, you've found your clip! Oh, good! You prayed to St. Anthony of Padua, no doubt? You're right. He's a very good man. I haven't found my watch! I should have prayed, too. I no longer have a watch. I can't be on time. Ah, good, you're smiling. No, but think about it. If I were Monsieur Personne, I would have taken the tickets that were lying around on the table. Right? If I was left alone. It's simple. Are you convinced? Yes? Then apologize to me. Ah, I deserve an… no, you don't want to. It's funny. Each time I ask for something, you don't give it to me. You're not giving. We're friends, though? -Friends. -That's the spirit. That's it. We're done. Oh, it's nice here. It's very, very nice. I love this gothic woodwork. And at my place, if you come, I'll show you an extraordinary Flemish triptych. -You will? -Ah, extraordinary. And I'll give it to you as a gift. That's too kind. It's very good, this… this door is extraordinary. Extraordinary… Can we open it? -Oh, yes, of course. -I'm curious, aren't I? Oh, lovely! The hall, the terrace… it's lovely. If I were you, I'd never be seen in Paris! Never! Oh, this park is beautiful! Just think… Who is it… is it good old Perrier? -Yes, of course. -What is he doing here? But who is he with? Who is the person with him? Myriam de Martel. You met her at my place in Paris, I think. -Do you remember? -Ah, yes. Oh, it's hot. You can say that you got me! Oh, Mr. de Trégunc! But I was just looking for a partner whom I could beat. This is not possible! You're in luck. I don't know how to play! How lovely your face is, ma'am. Ah, it's ping-pong! No, it's the reflection of the flowers. This garden is a paradise, really. I beg you, tell that to her guardian angel. I'll stop telling her! What a shame I can't stay. No, you're leaving already? -I must, alas. -Stay for lunch with us. Well, I'd love to, ma'am. -Is the Captain here? -Who is it? -Inspector Marchand. -He's waiting. You can go in. Thank you, sir. Captain, you have to put it everywhere: in the cellar, in the attic, behind the curtains. Inspector Marchand. I also have an office in which you can easily hide half a dozen gendarmes on foot. I have been looking forward to your arrival, Inspector. Your arrival was reported to me by the Audeville and Ferrières gendarmeries. Inspector, what is happening to me is unbelievable! Please, let us go in order. The story of the night's roadblocks? The brigades alerted me that none of the cars stopped had the man you reported. And all the drivers had proper papers! I received a… oh, well, he's leaving… Can I talk now? So, I'll introduce myself. Mr. Monin, notary in Fougues! A pleasure, sir, a pleasure. This morning, when I came back from high mass, I found an abominable letter on my desk! It is a scandal! Those people should be guillotined and cooked in boiling water! -Do you have this letter? -Yes. OK. The laundress… The laundress… Wait, where the hell did I put it… It's a letter signed by Monsieur Personne! -Here it is! -Well, well… Read it. -Well, well… -Read it! "Within 24 hours, I will take from you the funds you are receiving. Otherwise, no harm will come to you. Monsieur Personne." What do you say to that? "Monsieur…" How about you? Oh, I'll sleep well. Well, you've got guts. I have none. I'm the biggest coward there is. -I don't get it. -This notary's not crazy! I'm smart! I got rid of my money. What? Today is Sunday. The banks are closed. I know, but one of my clients, Madame Josette Verneau, has a modern safe that Monsieur Personne himself wouldn't dare to attack. And the transfer is already done? I'm on my way from her house right now! How much money have you deposited -with Madame Verneau? -1,050,000 francs, exactly. -It's quite a sum. -Oh, my. You could have waited to make such a serious decision. And you informed Madame Verneau of Monsieur Personne's threat? Oh, yes… yes, that is… no. I imagined… You intend to return to Madame Verneau's? Oh, well, I must admit I'd like to spend the night near my money. Captain, would you ask for the state police in Nice, please? Yes, yes. The… The… state police? -And you insist on sleeping by the safe? -Call Nice for me. Under the law, I have no right to part with money that I am the receiver of! OK, OK… I'll get you protection. Protection? Sweet Jesus… is there still danger? Thank you, sir. Hello? Yes? Send me four detectives immediately. Yes, yes. Paris has given me all the papers. Hello, hello? Yes, how long will it take them to get here? OK, perfect. Do you have a local map, Captain? Yes, yes, here you are, Inspector. Where's Madame Verneau's house? It is not located on this map, but you will find it on the edge of Route 71. There's no town in the vicinity. The notary's house? Here! I live here. Place du Vieux Marché. Good. Listen carefully. Monsieur Personne must be locked up today. You will place three inspectors at the notary's office. Do you think three is enough? If Monsieur Personne knows about the transfer, catching him will be easy. -Otherwise… -You're scaring me! Is Madame Verneau's house fenced in? Yes, walls all round it. Oh, but there are vicious dogs! Be careful! Perfect. It will be easier for us. As soon as I ask you, you'll place the gendarmes ten meters outside the walls. -OK? -We are going to be besieged. Do you see them? Well… there you go. That's not bad! You know what? I'm glad. -Where's it from? -Look again, and there! There they are. And look again quickly… they're gone! That's wonderful! Yes, but tell me, where did you learn these tricks? A long time ago, in high school, during physics class. You're a bad student, after all. Yes, but the cashier didn't think so, I tell you… -What do you mean? -I retook all my classes. So, I was paying twice as much as everyone else! Yes, but I haven't seen anything! That's what everyone says. Oh, be nice. Show me the trick. It's very difficult for you. It's very easy for me. -And with me, show it to me… -With you… So, follow along. Oh, well, if you don't drink… I'm watching. -Here are the dice. -Yeah. -Excuse me, ma'am. -What's the matter? -Excuse me, I'll be right back. -Ah, you… OK. -Here, OK. -I would like to know the trick. There you go. So, this is… would you pour me some Saint-Raphaël? -Gentlemen. -Ma'am. Our being here must surprise you. Yes. Allow me to introduce Inspector Chedal. You have news of the jewel robbery, no doubt? No, ma'am. We have just learned of Monsieur Personne's presence in these parts and his intention to steal the money which Mr. Monin received. Well, let him come! -Monsieur Personne? -Yes, ma'am. I am not talking about the 600,000 francs Mr. Préval should have given you. He didn't give it to you, and for good reason. What? But Mr. Préval arrived this morning by train from Paris. He gave me the money I wanted. -You saw Mr. Préval? -Yes. -He gave you the 600,000 francs? -Yes! What's going on? Why are you asking me all this? Tell me? Don't worry, ma'am. Nothing will happen to you. -Let me ask you some questions. -Of course. -You have guests, I believe? -Yes. Mr. Francis Perrier and Ms. Myriam de Martel. Have they been here long? They arrived with me four days ago. -And that's everyone? -Yes. Oh, no, there's Mr. de Trégunc, but he's just passing by. Yes, he arrived this morning by train, -and he must leave tomorrow. -Yes, yes. I don't know, ma'am, what your plans are for the next few hours, but I ask you in the most formal way to continue to behave normally, as if I were not here. I don't understand. It is essential that my presence be ignored. But Mr. Marchand, think it over. I can't live with this anxiety! I understand you, ma'am. Tomorrow, it will all be over. From now on, no outings, no walks, except on your property, which is guarded by the Fougues brigade. What do you mean by that? You're scaring me. Gentlemen, we are dealing with the most daring burglar of our time. If he threatened Mr. Monin, precisely on a Sunday, -he knew what he was doing. -A Sunday. He did it to move the money. And it is not at your office… but here that Monsieur Personne will come. Will I see him? What have I done to God to deserve such a punishment? Don't panic. Would you show me your safe, ma'am? Yes, here. My briefcase, here it is! Your 600,000 francs are on top? Yes, it's all there! Then you can close it up, scramble the combination. There we are. And give me the key, which I'll keep with me. -Is this the only one, ma'am? -Yes, it's the only one. And now, I'll leave you to your friends. Don't try to get in here until tomorrow. The doors will be locked. But Inspector, you're staying here. You're not leaving me like this… Ah, it is impossible for me to answer you. I can only tell you that Mr. Monin and Inspector Chedal will stay by the safe from now on. And my dinner! -I'll have it brought… -Impossible! Under no circumstances must anyone enter this room. I will die of starvation! Like that or otherwise. I'd rather not! What a mess I'm in! -I have one last thing to ask you. -Yes? Have you ever seen this man? No, never. Thank you, ma'am. -Ma'am. -Pardon me. As soon as I leave, -you will lock the other door. -Yes, OK. I need not tell you to close the iron shutters, too. Oh, misery of miseries… In case of an accident, do you have a last wish to express? Saint James the Great, have mercy on me! But with these heavenly friends, you're safe! And one last recommendation: call the gendarmerie in Fougues every hour. At the slightest unusual noise, ask for help. Understood? -Yes. -Good. Wait a moment! Wait… I don't have a gun. I have… a very small pocketknife with a very small blade. Yes, well, that's all very well, but don't be careless. -Do you have what you need? -To withstand a siege. Well, good. Good luck! He dared wish me good luck. It will surely bring us bad luck! He thinks it's funny, too. They all laugh, by the way… "Never make plans more than three seconds in advance," said a Chinese philosopher. But are you really leaving tomorrow morning? Yes, I'm sorry, but I have to leave very early. I'll have to say goodbye tonight. Not at all, not at all. Everyone here gets up very early. -Really? -Of course. Let's see, what time will you have your breakfast? Oh, ma'am, at seven o'clock. It's too early. -Not at all. -No… -Paul, did you hear that? -Yes, yes, ma'am. Hello? Hello, yes? Yes, everything is going very well, Captain. Yes, very, very well. No. No, nothing special to report. Mr. Monin? Oh, he's fine, very fine. And my stomach cramps? What are you going to do about them? Hello? Hello, yes? I understand. As agreed, we'll call you back in an hour. You can count on us. Goodbye, Captain. What are you doing? Looking at the barometer! There'll be a storm! Our Lady of Safe Keeping, -pray for us! -My dear sir, you deal. Well, kids, I have a principle in the countryside: I go to bed early. Oh, good idea! What a sad plan! Perhaps Mr. de Trégunc doesn't like it. Oh, you know, I don't have an opinion this evening. Tell me, do the cicadas stop you from sleeping? Oh, not at all, not at all. I sleep like a baby! -That's admirable! -Yes! -An angel goes by… -Yes, indeed. You are not very talkative this evening, ma'am. Excuse me, but I am very tired. I'll give you that. No, but I apologize. Oh, well, -you're not asleep yet? -I'll have a smoke then go to bed. Good night. Thank you. You too. Thank you. I have a coin! That's a good one. Ah… Ten o'clock! You know I've been going to bed at eight o'clock every night since I was widowed? Why should I care about that? Play! Saint Cloud, give me some trumps. Go ahead. I'll cut. Oy, oy, oy… Ah. It'll be time to make a phone call. Yeah, well, go call. There's no reason for the gendarmes to sleep. Hello? Hello? Yes, well, if I'd planned this, I would have brought bread and chocolate. Here, my good friend. Take this. I'll take this… Well, I knew a man condemned to death… Oh, no, no, no. Please don't speak. The night is going well. Don't spoil it with ghost stories. -Yes. In any case, you're in it. -Oh, well, never mind. I shuffle, and you cut. Go ahead. Well, you see, that's better, eh! Saint Bridget! My… Here we go again. Bravo, bravo. The gas did its work. A cannon shot wouldn't wake them. "It is salty, liquid, "and covers two thirds of the globe." In three letters… Guérin. Guérin! Are you asleep? -Did they call? -No, they didn't. What time is it? Oh, Captain, it's 3:20 a.m.! 3:20 a.m.? Telephone right away! Twenty minutes late is very worrying. Hello? Hello, hello? Hello? Hello? Yes, Captain… huh? Oh, no, no, no. We weren't sleeping. We weren't paying attention. We missed the hour. What do you mean? Oh, the notary? He's fine, very fine. You see, Captain, there was no need to worry… Yes… I understand… Goodbye, Captain. I think I fell asleep a little. Ah, you bet. -You even snored. -Oh, well, that… you know, it's a… it's a little flaw of mine. You should have woken me up. -Oh, well, that's what I did. -Ah? What… what time is it? 3:30 a.m. 3:30 a.m.! Life is good! Do you want my opinion? -No, I don't. -Oh, well, yes. He's not… coming. Well, that's exactly what -the captain told me just now. -Well, there you go. It's me, Inspector Marchand. You can open it. Oh? -Hello. -Hello. Hello, sir. -Hello. -And so? So… nothing. Oh, well, do you want my opinion on this Monsieur Personne? If it makes you happy. This Monsieur Personne is a big bluff. Meanwhile, it stinks of smoke in here. Oh, boy, you've already deprived me of dinner. You're not going to deprive me of smoking now? Oh, no! We telephoned the police regularly, and they didn't report anything. I know, I know. Inspector, would you do me a great favor? You want a sandwich? Oh, no, it's not that. I deprive myself when I have to. I'd like to see my money. That's a good idea. Get Madame Verneau to open the safe for us. Then I can leave? -Hurry up, will you? -You can count on me. So? Well? What do you think of all this? Oh, it seems simple enough to me. In front of such forces, Monsieur Personne did not try the impossible. He wisely gave up on his plan. Yes. But the day is not over. It has only just begun. No, no need to worry, in my opinion. It is Monday morning. The banks in Nice open at 9:00 a.m. Later on, with a good escort, I will have this money transported. Ah, good morning. Did you sleep well, ma'am? Yes, thank you… I'm glad it all ended with more fear than harm. And so am I. To please Mr. Monin, I will ask you to open the safe. Here is your key. Thank you, Inspector. My money, my money! My briefcase, I see it again! Saint Gudula has heard my prayer! Oh, if the Inspector would be so kind, you will open the briefcase, so that I may be completely reassured. You seem a bit like Saint Thomas. Oh, Saint Thomas, mercy. I forgot about him. Here. Here you go. -Are you happy? -Yes, I'm happy! Oh, no! Help… It's Mr. Perrier having fun. Oh, oh, I was afraid. And now, can you tell me what you intend to do? Take the money, and under my supervision, have it transported to Nice. And my guests? -Let them do as they please. -Good. -Chedal. -Yes? You can notify the Fougues brigade. -Ah, Germain. Go get my suitcase. -Yes, Your Lordship. Oh, I beg your pardon. Sorry to intrude, but I must leave. I came to say goodbye. -Mr. Monin, Fougues notary. -Nice to meet you, sir. -I am honored. -A friend of Mr. Monin. -You know Mr. Marchand, I believe. -Yes. Not old acquaintances, but we've already met. -Indeed, sir, yes. -Haven't we? I'd like to thank you for your warm welcome, ma'am. I would have been happy to stay longer, but it's not easy in my situation. Here, don't bother. I know the way. Goodbye. Goodbye, gentlemen. Ah. -Come on. -Wait, wait, wait! Don't leave! Here… here, Mr. de Trégunc, will you accept this hare? I don't know anything better for stew! It's really dead, right? -I swear. -I'm as sensitive as a young girl! Put it in the back. Give my regards to Ms. Myriam. It would be a crime to wake her up. She's not sleeping. Here she is! And with flowers! How, how could you have left without saying goodbye? I thought you'd forgotten me. Oh, not at all, not at all. I picked these flowers for you. -Oh, you're very kind. -Thank you very much! Here we go. Do you think… oh, he's jealous. He's jealous! He'll get his little flower. Here it is! -Goodbye. -Goodbye. -Goodbye. -And have a nice trip! Be careful! -Thank you. Go, go! -Goodbye! -Goodbye! -Goodbye! My Lord was right not to insist. If my Lord had been stubborn, we'd have been toast. Well, it's no use. Forget it. It will be for another time. Finally… I just pulled off the biggest success of my career. Yes, here it is, the million. Look… eyes on the road! Were you looking at the sidewalk? And there's one thing you don't know yet. And that's that I outdid myself today. The million from the notary is still in the safe, only the bills are fake. The real ones are here. But there were 1,600,000 francs in the safe. Yes, yes, 600,000 francs from Madame Verneau. -Did you leave it there? -Oh, some women you can't steal from. Eyes on the road! Step on it! THE END Subtitle translation by: K.M. Kownacki
