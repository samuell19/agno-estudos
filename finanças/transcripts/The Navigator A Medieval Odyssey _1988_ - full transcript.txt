Bring it back! Do we pull it out? It's too deep, bring it back! Don't move! Griffin, wake up! What did I do? We called you, shout at you and you didn't wake! Griffin! It's the fourth time this week! When will you get out of the water? A cathedral... ...people... ...digging in the earth. Aw, Griffin! No, it's true! It's true! it's true! Griffin is dreaming... He's out of his head. No, no. Let the old men first. Where did they start? Do not forget the peddler who was here on Monday last... "If it finds you at breakfast... and you're dead by noon", he sais. It's Connor I'm worried about. If something is abroad, Why isn't he back yet? It's been too long. I'll find him. Tomorrow I'll go. Whatever is out there... ...they don't know him. Griffin... ...the sun is on the west wall. You're going to be late! Dreamers will be cold in rags, Griffin. Leave the Griffin alone. Wasn't the one you had up there big enough? There's been enough ill fortune come down on this house for ten families. If the sickness gets this far we'll need something to protect us. You're overdoing it. Come on, it is big enough. You'll be the leader of the herd, Griffin. Go on, hurry. Go on, don't you get cold now boy. - Cumbria, March 1348 - This one comes out of the earth, carrying people. Growing closer. Do you remember the peddler who brought us the faggots? "By the hundreds", he said... "They were falling dead without warning". To die, I don't like it. Chrissie! Go on, Griffin. If Connor comes, Chrissie will let you know. Go down on it, Griffin. Connor's kinda sharp, he knows the ways of the wild. Are you right there now? Off you go. Down to Hell. The finding of it. So, how many days has he gone now? 36. It's work that drives away the worry. If we put each a spike on our roofs, we'll all be protected. There's talk about places that Death just keeps tripping over... An offering to God is making them safe. An offering would mean a journey, wouldn't it Searle! We'd take it off to the big cities. You? We'd draw back the curtain. We'd show us the holy rights, Saint Augustin's finger bone... And feathers from Archangel Gabriel. Nothing's been outside of the village before. None of us have. And nobody would want to neither. Look at Connor... He's still not back. I start to fear. I don't want to be in his shoes. Griffin! It's Connor! Go on. Connor! Wait! Wait, Griffin. We're coming up. Easy! Hold on, Griffin. Connor! Easy! Connor! Come on, Chrissie! Faster! Come on, Chrissie! Griffin! Connor! Connor, you're back! It's a miracle! Look at them: you'd think they were married. Tomorrow I would have gone and find you. How would you been doing that? I would fly like a bird and I would ask for help for the trip. You would, eh? You won't go away like that no more, Connor, will you? No, never. Never. Look. It is a new method for counting your devotions They're made out of oak for great lords Rosewood for rich ladies. This one's made from sandalwood. It is a craggy tree, small and tough. Reminded me of someone. It's the same tree they makes axes from. Axes of wood. If I am a big wheel on the move... It's because it's you in my heart. You and Linnet. Connor! Look, here she comes. Connor! If you had not come back... I can feel it growing, Connor. It's already 8 months gone now. God, I do not know what I would have done if you'd not... The dog's nose started to bleed and we couldn't stop it. We thought it was a sign. We felt for sure that you were lost. Con'! Searle! Martin! Connor, you're back! It's so strange to see people smiling. What's happening out there, Con'? We've heard the stories. We've got to do something, yes! We could meet tonight. Hurry! Hurry! There's a powerful evil on the move... Connor has seen it. A pestilence which makes haste in the full moon, he says... Do we fear it or do we plan? Tell them, Arno! A week back, a monk crossed the lake. He spoke of a great church being built into West. He says it's highest in all Christendom. There's pilgrims come from everywhere. You make an offering, you stop the Death. No, the church is too far! It's beyond further reaches are left off here. Across mountains, across seas... across places that aren't names for them. We got to go, Searle, there's pilgrims on every road. With Connor's to lead the party, we'll do it. He knows the outside world better than anyone of us. What do you say, Connor? I've seen pilgrims, Martin. I've seen so many bodies there weren't enough living to bury the dead. I've seen mobs chasing monks from their abbeys for refusing last rights to dying. It's the same monks that head West as pilgrims might. They're people no more than animals. You can trust no one. Children... begged me for food. I didn't dare go nearer. And black boils under their armpits ready to burst and they denied plague was upon them. All the churches are empty. And still not satisfied, the evil keeps striding forth with each full moon. We've got a month maybe two, with a scrap of God's grace. We could do it. Reach the church and raise a spike of Cumbrian copper. With you or Searle to lead our party. I deserve this chance. Show the faith. Here's to taking it! Our journey! Then Searle must do it... I am sick of all the death. Intruders in the lake! Con'! Come on! I never thought I'd see the day where you'd stay put. Now you are among friends. Don't touch! We must defend our village. In the lake! They defy the village! Are they armed? Hey! Look! Lost looters. No, there's women and children on board. Refugees from the East. They're scared, scared of the Death. Somebody gather the spears. It's best to keep'em out of ourselves. I heard a story once. In the old pit on the isle of mine. They reckon there's a hole up there So deep that if you'd dropped a stone down it, sooner or later It will fall out the far side of the Earth. The copper... An offering. We've got to take the offering, Con'! To the great church, to the far side of the Earth Look. There is no time for your journey, Martin. It's the plague. They have the Death and... It's too late. It will be up to 20 miles long for Gostford in the morning. It's full moon, bears its contagion for it like a sac. As sunrise she lets it fall... on us. Help! Griffin! Griffin! What is it? Are you all right? Griffin! What's wrong? - Wake up Griffin! - Griffin! Griffin, wake up! - Griffin! - Wake up! What's wrong, Griffin? The seam, the pit. In the dream we were tunneling through to the furthest part of the Earth. You're hearing the clouds again, Griffin? Leave him. There's signs within dreams, he's been right before. Like last year's Con'? The vein of copper in the pit? Have you forgotten? Will we do the journey then? Agreed. I'm with you then. It's our only chance. Come on! And Griffin comes too. So I carry the cross, eh? Why should always men carry the weight? Hey, Ulf! Ulf! There's a church at the far reaches of the Earth. It is the greatest in the world. The pilgrims say that it's there. And that's this place I will leave the Virgin. And I will put it there myself, for you, mother. Ulf! Ulf! I'm coming, Searle! Don't go! Don't go without me! Wait! Wait! Keep the fire burning. We'll be back soon! Ulf, come on, hurry up. Always to the front or too far behind. What is it? It's what I told you before. We're tunneling through the Earth. All of us. We are using a engine. The engine is going to shaft for breaking the rock and dirt. The engine you see, it mixes fast enough... ...to be there before the moon turns full. The moon struck you daft. Not, it is true. I saw it in dreams. And I keep seeing it. And I am sure that the big black hole is there too. Come out here! Come on! Hurry! What the hell? I think you got a son sleepwalking, Searle. But I've never been down here before. You know that, Con'. So... It is just like in your dream. To the other side of the Earth. We follow the torch. It's blown by the wind. It's come from the other side of the Earth. We use the machine to tunnel. Take it, take it. Move back! Out! Keep it going! Keep it going! More rocks. There, go! We must keep moving. Faster than the moon! We're not yet on the other side. But hurry. There she comes. We must hurry or the village is lost. Griffin, to be able to break through to the other side of the Earth, that's just two days digging... ...Without the sky, like we have to cling like a tick. It is further than we thought. Three times the length of your rope, Arno. No, all of six times that length. Before we struck the last hard rock between us and the far side of the world. Come on now! There it goes! Again! Look! What is it? What's that smell! It's tunnel. Tunnels under the soil. Only great cities have them. Underground sewers where every household can empty its bucket. My God! It's huge! Whatever city is up there must be... vast! I'll go! Hold your horses. Not, it's allright. I'll be able to tell them where we are. Connor, put the rope to him just to be safe. I mean, you never know. This will help you with the air, Griffin. to find out if the air is poisonous or full of contagion. God speed. Griffin! Griffin! Griffin! Griffin. Griffin! Griffin! I can see the sky! The sky! All the skies above! We're here! We are there. Come on, let's go up. Searle, Searle. Searle, I am afraid. I am afraid. It's alright. Come on. It is as if it was on fire. Hundred thousands fires. Torches. Think how much wood they need for all that. That's the city. The city I kept seeing in my dreams. Lights, water, trees, grasses. It's all fixed down to earth. God's goodness! It makes sense. Everything flat's got two sides. And if the evil is our side... ...Then surely God is on this one. It has to be God's city, alright. Can you see its great church? No. No? What do you mean, no? I can't see it. Nothing is higher than a church spire. surely you can see it. Searle, in big cities the buildings are higher than a man can see over. But the boy surely must know where it is. Come on Searle. Let's go. Just remember, Con'... there's a run of ill fortune struck our family these past years. It is enough, we have to take care. But it must be God's city. There's so much light... Where is Ulf? Ulf! I am here, don't leave me behind. I've always had to stay at home. So I'm glad to get a chance to journey out a bit. You see, I've got something special. A Lady of wood. Say, it was my secret! The little Virgin my mother gave us before she passed on. I'll put her in the cathedral for her myself. Con', can you see me placing her as an offering for my mother then? I am sure I keep remember as we go along, you know. Searle, come on. Let's just get on with it. So pretty. So pretty. Ulf! Ulf, you get back, don't cross here. For God's sake. Ulf! Come here brother! Give me your hand. Get in here, by Christ! - What is going on? - My little Virgin, I lost it! Griffin, do we cross that? I don't remember. Do we go across lights? - Griffin? - Yes. Come on then, everybody together, then we're strong. Are you ready? Searle. The Virgin. Go. Wait. Ulf? Where is Ulf? - Ulf! - You're supposed to come with us! By Jesus all blessed to me! Listen to me! Nothing on your side, you get to the middle. I'll take it from there. I'll kill the bastards if they try to stop me. Take it back first. Come on. It's alright, Ulf. Stay right back. Con'. God's speed, Griffin. We separate here. I'm going to go on to the cathedral. We'll never have time to raise the spire if we stay together. I will travel faster if I'm alone, I can have everything done by the time you arrive. - You will not leave my brother. - It is all for the village, Searle. You take charge here, find the foundry... get that spike cast and get it to the cathedral. Come on, let's everybody just do what they have to do. Connor, no! Take charge? Find the foundry? In this place? All you have to do is use your nose. Even in big cities you can smell the foundry. Stench in the wind, still a coarse. But you take care of the boy, Searle. Connor! You promised. - You swore you'd never leave. - Move away from me. Connor's gone, he could be lost. The city is so big Martin, so queer. Don't fret, Griffin. He's the only one who's right for all of us. And however big the city... ...There's only one church. He hit me. Ulf! Wait for me. I come back for you, I swear it. Do you hear me Ulf? We'll come by on our way back. Don't leave me. Griffin. If there are things in your dream that can help us, keep us out of danger, you got to make sure we know about them. If we could have kept Ulf from walking into that... I didn't know! I can't know about everything! But if you do know something you'd better let us know about all! Oh Christ! Bloody Eric! The bastard didn't even stop. What's all this then? Hare bloody Krishna? They look like they've been in the bush for a while. The kid's alright. I smell a toad. The stench in the wind. What the hell? Connor, I've got one. Foundry. Griffin, come here. Foundry. Nothing broken. Don't worry, lad. You're only the last in a long series of accidents. Hey, Tom. Come on, we'll dress this in the shop. Blacksmiths. We brought copper. We shield out of the butt, aren't you boy? Copper, cast it. Now. Connor said that you'd cast the spike. You've got to help us or the village is lost. Please, cast it. Do you understand these beggars? Copper? Ay, Ay, copper. You must cast it for us. Careful, Arno. There's no pedal! Smithy. You've got to help us. Please, Smithy. Cast the spike. If it's casting you're after? Sorry, son, but we're being closed down. For the church. Hang on. Join me here. The church wanted us to cast a pentacle. Put the scaffold up. We had this bit lying around here for months. Waiting for them to scratch around, getting some money.. No money.. The church is poor? Yes, well like any other business, hey? When they don't want what you're selling. Selling? Hell! Pour the copper for us, please. Pour the copper. The church sent you, did it? Who in the hell are you? Cast metal, now Jesus! And we bloody thought you were the wreckers! Good copper. Ay, Cumbrian copper. Smithy! We're a foundry, aren't we? We cast things? I never saw a stove like that. Now we water that spike No, just let it cool 'til tomorrow. No! Before the dawn we got to raise it up by then. To raise it? Tonight? You want to raise this, tonight? Ay, our man Connor is on his way to prepare the spire. Have a beer. Who are you guys? Ale. Let's help 'em now. It's our last night, Smithy. Give it a bash! There's no money in this, no one will pay. But the copper is a tribute. And surely people have come as we did. With gifts. Gifts? From across the world. Well, put it this way. You probably be the first. Please, Smithy, you must! Anyone else comin', I wouldn't do it. Come on, let's put water about it... and we'll put some scaffolding in the back of the wagon. Now Martin... ...You stay with the blacksmiths. We'll move on. Not unless you can swim. The cathedral is on the far side of the harbor. That's right! We cross water! Quicker. Quicker out of here. Bloody horse. Come here - Searle, it's stealing. - Come here! Push it Griffin, we need it. Just go still, will you? Just go still. This bloody arse is just going to hold us off. Arno, we need it to wrench up the spike. Look, you know what happened to me last time. It only burned, the bloody thing. Look, you won't get off that thing until we're aboard this boat. It seems he doesn't like the water very much. Don't give me worms. Bring in that bloody horse. Bloody horse? Doesn't matter to you if I loose the other arm, but flinging does it? Hey! You! Bring it back. If they take an ant for a horse. What will they think of a horse about a boat? Hush! Something. We're never getting there. We're too slow. This boat's too slow. Arno, take oars. Griffin. If there's something out there, will you tell us? I don't like this. I thought I told you to roar! I row. There's nothing out there, is this so? What the hell is that? You never tell us anything! What is it? Evil... An omen. - You never bloody tell us! - I didn't see it! How could I have seen that? It's coming against us! Listen to us! We're navigators from Cumbria, we've got the right of expedition! God's faith! Forsaken! Left me on my own! Oh God! Saint Mary Mother of Christ, not the ocean deep! I can't swim! Everything we don't need, throw it over! I can't swim! Where's your damn church, Griffin? I don't know! Is it the last church of hell you're taking us to, boy? Go in, fish. Don't move! Remember the queen fish dive. Above it, the church spire. One of us will fall. One of us, dead! One of us will die at the cathedral! Who? Who dies at cathedral? I don't know. No? Not Arno. Two hands, with hand over hand before he fell. It's me, ain't it? The end for me. I've watched them all. My wife in childbirth. The child she died for. Picked away. My mother. Picked away. Picked away! And Ulf. Picked away and... Picked away! No, Arno! He holds our fate in his hands. Oblivion, Griffin! I'm last. I die. And my blood dies. Connor. Connor! I hope you'll see it. Luck's always been with Connor. For the love of God, Griffin, tell us. We can't move until you tell us! Might be Martin, or you! Could be me! I want Connor, I want my brother back. Oh, God. Connor! Connor. What is it? What's wrong? None of us is wearing gauntlets. God's speed. It's Connor! He's the one who falls! Connor's going to fall! Arno, talk to him. Make sure he don't try swimming. As soon as we reach shore, we will run like the wind, boy. No! It's not fast enough. I've got to take the horse. The horse stays with me. There are right huge shoes, like Connor. You stay away from these things. They're not going anywhere. But Searle! I've got to meet him at the church before he falls. You'll not leave us now, will you? Without you, we're blind. It's Connor. The tallest spire in christendom. How the hell did he get up there? When we reach shore, remember no one travels alone, Griffin... You're our eyes, you stay with us. Griffin! Now what? Griffin! Don't leave us! You can't! You can't do that! Searle, come back! Come on! Come on! Hey, Searle! Hurry. Searle! Come back here, boy! What am I supposed to do with this boat? If I don't catch him we're lost! What about me? Where do I go? I must catch him to find out! Wait! Griffin! Wait for me! The fact is, you still have an alliance with the Pentagon. This is the real world, year 1988. You can isolate one little pocket in the world... and say, nuclear free, You can try, but then... there is no real act. No pocket, no escape from the real world. Where is the cathedral? I will break all the windows! Get back, boy. Griffin, come here. Come here, Griffin. The spike! It's coming! The cathedral, Griffin. The refuge, make us safe. I lost it. I can't see the spire anymore. Connor... Connor is going to fall. I don't recognize any of this. We'll find him. We'll find him. I don't get a chance to catch air. Clear the rope! Clear! It won't move! The cord is stuck! Clear it! Be careful! We still have some time left! It's moving! Get someone to ring bell, Martin. Signal the others, the city's vast. I am still lost, it's like... ... I see too much Which way boy? Show us! A signal. Where, Griffin? Where? Which way, boy? Spire on its way, up! Searle! Searle! Cover my eyes. Quick. Blindfold me. Hurry! Hurry! It's this way! Or here? No! This way. Wait. Ok, take it up a little. Just keep her right in there. Con'! Look out! Griffin. What's wrong? Don't move! This way! Aye! It's not safe! Not, it's alright. The blacksmiths give good instructions. In Griffin's dream, it's Connor who fell. It is going to strike it! Beware the wind! Hang on! Secure it, damn it! The horse. Tie him to it! Make it fast! Get back, Griffin! Griffin, don't go! Griffin, don't! Griffin, watch out! Griffin, stay back. Con', it's not safe for you. Safe for no one, the moon is it. We've got to get the spike raised before the dawn be. Leave it to me. Can you do it? Griffin, your hand. Here. God's speed. Easy, now. Easy... Good, now get up there! Easy, Griffin... Come on, Griffin! We'll hear the bells loud and clear at dawn... if they're still well... The dawn's coming, for good or evil. There's no time! There's no time, Griffin! Come on, boy! You made it, boy! You made it! The bells. They're safe! Do you hear that? It was me that fell. Connor! Griffin! Are you there, lads? The bells' rang this far, you two got in. Listen, it's Linnet. Hello! Con'! Linnet! It's no one sick! Did you hear that? Griffin, it could be we've done it! They're well. It's a sign. A dream. You had a wonderful dream, Griffin. A wonderful story. It was like a window opened. So... Everyone reached the great church but me. I got stuck at the black hay road. You didn't get stuck, Ulf. We don't do it. We're long gone by then. You went forth. You showed the little Virgin... ....the celestial city Hey, Ulf. You've been travelling. The little Virgin. Could we place her in the great church? Perhaps do you think it was enough to have shown her the great city? That's enough. I did that. I did that watch. It was a dream, Griffin. Hey, but what a dream! The vision of Hell. Connor. You're safe! - Gregor. - Searle. It's fine to see you. God's speed to us all. The moon's already turned and no one's fallen down. No one! It's great. The village is saved! Have we dreamed? Could it be? The Death! You won't go away like that, you won't, Connor, will you? No, never. Stay away from me. Connor, no! Death... Connor. Griffin! You knew! You were sick all along! You knew! Griffin, I... The Death! How could you've come back? Listen, I swear I didn't know It wasn't far enough while we were in the Pit. And then I kept my distance... from all of you. I swear it. Then I was afraid. There was nothing else I could do. There was nowhere else for me to go. And I came to believe the unfolding of your story was... I came to believe it was my salvation. The salvation of us all. But the dream made you safe. It's true, isnt' it? It's true. The plague's left me and ended. The scars are all that remains. Are we lost. Do we all die, then? Not, it can't be! If the infection's break loose... Not, because I dreamed one died. Only one. It won't break loose! She will not return to the village. I want them to know the threat is gone. The village is safe. Con', you tell them! You bring them around! Make them believe my story! They must! You tell them once, you Con'! They will believe it. God's speed. Farewell, boy.
