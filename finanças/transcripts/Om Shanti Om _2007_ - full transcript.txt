Mr. 'Hero'! Who me? Yes you!! ls that your father's jacket that .. .. you are happily sneaking out with it?! E! Don't drag my father into this! Why? ls your dad some 'Raj Kapoor' who will stop our shoot! Come on, return the jacket! Quick! Relax! The 'hero' gave it to me with so much love, that l just wore it! Come on! Wearing this jacket will not make you a hero.. You need a good face and personality as well! Now give it back! ldiot! Spoilt the jacket -Every fool wants to become a hero! Uncle. Pappu! Did you hear that! Don't worry Buddy! How will a drunk dressman recognise a superstar like you? Superstar?! Pappu you're sure l will become a hero? Of course! You Will definitely become a hero. My mom also says that! l bet every comedian's mother says that to her son as well Omi! Really! - Yes! That's how mothers are! But you will surely become a hero. But l, Pappu Master am telling.. ..you that you will become a hero. Because you have everything it takes - Style, Hair style, Grace, Face, Talent! But there is just one thing standing between you and your stardom! What's that? Your name! My name? Om Prakash Makhija! Your Credit for two months is still pending! Ok OK! l will clear it! When, in this lifetime or the next? By the way, your soggy cream rolls.. .. are also from the silent movie era! Pappu! The day l become a superstar, l will shut down this canteen first! You better remember my name Mister, Om Prakash Makhija.. Go. That's the problem Omi! We could have managed with just Om and Prakash.

The producers will start queuing up instantly! Just Govinda will do?! Try it! Thank you! Thank you! You're right Pappu. Why did father give me this name? Out of all the amazing actors in the.. .. industry like Jeetendra, Dharmendra. But my Dad's favourite had to be Om Prakash! Gosh! Look! Here comes everyone's favourite-Rajesh Kapoor! Autograph, please. - Please, sir. Now that is a Hero's name - Kapoor! A name to reckon with! Now get rid of this Makhija and try changing your name to .. ..

Do you know, l was called by the Great K. Asif to screen test? lf it wasn't for you in my stomach.. .. then your Mother would have been Anarkali of ''Mughal-e-azam''! Madhubala was not too bad herself, but if l was the heroine of the film- - Then the film would have flopped badly! Mom the truth is.. ..that you are a Junior Artiste, dad was a junior artiste.

Call Mukeshji! Suresh Uncle, what is all this drama? Same old story! The heroine is refusing to shoot.. .. they must have not paid her for the last schedule! Of course not! The Producer of this.. .. film is a very big man - Mukesh Mehra! lt doesn't matter how big or small the Producer is.. ..these stars treat all of them like dogs! Uncle!!! - Control! Our Shanti ji is not like that! Correct! Mukesh Mehra is the one who gave her the first break! ln a film called 'ode to youth'. Then Shanti was only sixteen! ''Greetings..'' Hey! Mukeshji is here! Mukeshji Now watch, how the shooting will start in ten minutes?! Mukesh ji is amazing. -What personality! Totally Dashing! He should become a hero! He is Tall as well! Smarty pants! You know uncle, we would never.. .. do this measly dacoit role for any other producer. lt is Mukeshji's film that's why we agreed! You seem to be coughing a lot suddenly. All ok.. Shanti will be ready in 10 minutes. You set up the shot. Very good! Problem solved! Mukeshji. My creativity is sinking.. Stop crying for every little thing Partho. This is Bombay. This is how we make films here. And make sure you finish this scene today itself. Of course! Of course!! l have placed three cameras. Just like the great art house makers - One Satyajit Ray angle.. ..One Bimolda angle, One Gurudott angle.. totally in the shadows. Put a Manmohan Desai angle as well! The mainstream one. That's the one that will work. Camera ready! Wide angle! Take it to a bit right. Shanti baby! You are too much really! You took so long! What are you doing after pack up darling? Committing Suicide!

You came for half a shift only! lt's hurting a lot Omi? - Yes. Have you lost it? Look at me, l am talking to you! What would l go and tell mother, if something were to happen to you? Look at me, l am talking to you! Oh ho! Shanti was in the fire. Shanti can go to hell! There were lots of people to rescue her. But who would have come to save you? Look at me, l am talking to you! Then stop moving around! Shut up! Thank God your back was burnt and not your face! Otherwise, instead of becoming a film star.. .. you would have to work in a horror film! Fine, l would have worked in a horror film. So what? Worse come to worse l would have died in that fire? So what? Pappu, l did not think that time. All l could see was Shanti trapped in that fire, helpless. And you know, if need be, l will jump in that fire again and again! Not once but hundred times, thousand times, to save Shanti! Because nothing is more precious to me than Shanti's life. My life, my dreams, nothing matters! Now you look at me! You look at me! What are you doing? What are you doing? l have known many people in my life, but nobody has ever done anything like this for me.. .. what you have done, being a stranger. Shanti! l may be a stranger for you.

You are a liar! - Un.. unn cut it!!. How could l not come? lt was a promise made to a friend l had to keep it. You have stopped me from saying thank you.. ..but please don't say no to this. "l have found you but it seems l have lost myself!" "l want to tell you but then how do l tell?" "l have found you but it seems l have lost myself!" "l want to tell you but then how do l tell?" "ln any language that is known l can't find the words alone.." "To tell you, what you mean to me." "What if l say, a beauty like yours.. Can't be found in this cosmos!" "Your beauty and allure l may extol.." ".. but all this is truly, nothing at all!" "l have found you but it seems l have lost myself!" "A sparkling demeanor flows from your face.." "Your deep dark tresses, descend in a dazzling maze!" "Your scarf that is flowing.. is like a whiff of cloud blowing." "Draped in your embrace.. are both beauty and grace!" "lf l say, charisma as yours.." "Can't be found, and will never be around!" "Your beauty and allure l may extol.." ".. but all this is truly, nothing at all!" "l have found you but it seems l have lost myself!" "You are very generous today.. then here is the story from this day." "You are very generous today.. then here is the story from this day."

Who is loved by the entire world! Sometimes, the entire world's love is not enough Om. Sometimes getting love from that one person is what counts. You will get that love Shanti. All you have to do is reach out for it. You will get whatever you want. You deserve all the happiness in the world. All you have to do is ask! And then see, happiness will follow you around! Really? - Really! l will ask Om. l will go for it. And l will be happy. And l will be the king of the world! Brother! Why is this Junior Artiste getting so excited. He's not the hero! Cut it! Omi!

Shanti! - Wait! Where are you going? Shantiji knows me! There are only star's make up rooms here. But l am also a star! - Get lost from here. Sir is here. Greetings, sir. l don't know, he was here right now. Yes l have checked. Look at this magazine Mukesh. lt says that you are getting married to Harsh Mittal's daughter! And getting Mittal Studios as your wedding gift! God Dammit! lt is all rubbish. You will hear Gossip like this everyday, you know why? Because we are making the biggest, the most expensive.. .. film ever made in lndia! Om Shanti Om! l am the Producer of the film, you are the heroine.. .. and Mittal is the man who is making all this possible! Shanti, Mittal has already invested forty lakhs in this project. So now stop behaving like a child and go and shoot. Delays in shooting schedule means bad business. You always think about business. That's why you are marrying Harsh Mittal's daughter? But how are you going to go through with this wedding Mukesh? Because you are already married! To me! Shanti please! Be quiet. What if some one hears us? Please try to understand Shanti! Why don't you understand Mukesh? We have been married for two years now.. ..and l can't be acknowledged as your wife in public! l don't care for anything else Mukesh . Not even Mittal's forty lakhs. All want, is to be accepted as your wife. Really? Let me tell you something Shanti. The day you will step out of the house as my wife.. ..'Om Shanti Om' will be finished! Because no one will invest a penny in a married heroine's film! Everything will be doomed! Not only your career, but my future as well! You are my future Mukesh. l am your wife. You have to accept me in front of the entire world. This is what will give me happiness. And today l want to make that choice. Don't l deserve to be happy?! What is this madness Shanti!? You will do Om Shanti Om.. ..and after it is finished, we will tell everyone. OK? But it will be too late by then. What do you mean? l mean that l am pregnant! Mukesh! You're going to be a father! What? You are Pregnant? This is.. fantastic! Why didn't you tell this to me earlier? - Really? Of course! "Neither do l live.." "Nor do l die." "Tell me what to do, l want to say good bye!" "Hearts were torn apart, before they could be tied." "Souls were separated in a chasm so wide." "What has destiny in store who knows!" "These eyes well up with tears yet again." "Seeking a glimpse of you but in vain!" "My beloved, this is destiny's game!" "How do l live each day? Without you, it's a desolate bay!" "Neither do l live.. nor do l die." "A dream when destroyed.. makes your world a void." "Your love is not your's anymore.. your life is a barren core." "Why does this happen.." "..when this heart sobs, around me the howling winds toss." "And my life seems totally lost." "A dream when destroyed makes your world a void." "Your love is not your's anymore. Your life is a barren core." Shanti, you did the right thing. You chose your happiness. Don't think you have broken my heart! l am happy, because you are happy. But you must tell Mr. Mehra, that this l am letting him go.. ..only for you. But if l ever happen to meet him again in any other life time.. ..he better watch out! Mind it!!

No. This story is being written by somebody up there!

This time Mukesh Mehra will pay for all his sins! This time Shanti will get justice Pappu. This time everything will be all right. Because the film is not over yet, my friend! You want to start 'Om Shanti Om' again? That's ridiculous! You must be joking! l'm serious Mukesh. You know l get 3 to 4 scripts offered everyday.. ..but l reject all of them! But 'Om Shanti Om'!

How does it matter if anyone else believes in it or not? As long as you believe in it.. .. as a maker, you have to believe in the script Mukesh. Call me Mike. Everyone in Hollywood does! Mike! Mukesh becomes Mike.. that's funny Mike! Thanks to Mike. That film didn't even have a climax! l mean that project was jinxed. Bloody doomed! Jinxed? The project was jinxed for that lnsurance Company .. .. who paid you four times the actual price of your set! Then you got married to that Harsh Mittal's daughter .. .. and got a big studio as your wedding gift! Then you went to Hollywood, earned millions of dollars .. ..you didn't even take a single shot and 'Om Shanti Om' .. .. became the biggest film of your career! So where is the jinx?

Ok! l am not Ok. l am scared of fire! Really? l am scared of fire. l don't know why. And.. Seriously speaking if you want to make any film with me .. .. then it has to be 'Om Shanti Om', otherwise l am not interested. You know you are very stubborn OK. l know that. l like that. l am going to America for a month. lf you find a heroine till then.. ..we'll start the shoot! You got it. You got it. And don't worry about the climax Mike. This time l will write the end of this story myself! Come on, Cheers. To a new beginning! To a new end, Mike! 'Pinch of this vermillion'.. shot 1, take 5!

Om, we all are trying! But the poor thing doesn't even know why are we doing all this! What is our plan?! What plan! This plan can only be successful when.. .. Mukesh Mehra believes that Shantipriya is back! She only looks like Shantipriya! She can't be like Shantipriya. lt'll take one second for Mukesh Mehra to figure out, that she's not Shanti! Then he's gone! He'll take the next flight out! The plan will be finished! Then we'll have to tell her everything Om! We'll have to tell her what is all this.. and why is it so important? Before being Shanti, she will have to understand her Om! Om Shanti Om's story is the story of my life. l should have told you all this before Sandy!

And if the producer of the film won't come how will it look? And l am not your servant! No! l can't handle everything for you! l am a star Mikey, l'm a superstar! So let me tell you one thing.. l am through with your 'Om Shanti Om'! Take your film and stuff it! Go back to L.A. Whatever! And one more thing, l can do ten other films.. .. but you have borrowed a lot of money from the market.. ..and if 'Om Shanti Om' is shelved again, you will be on the roads! You will be finished Mikey! No, you can't do this! Oh shut up! Don't show me the finger! l can do this and l will! lf you want 'Om Shanti Om' to finish, and get released .. ..then be there for the music launch! Otherwise you and your film both, can go to hell! Because frankly my dear, l don't give a damn! So fish it! Have you lost it Om? How will we prepare everything in two days? This plan was supposed to be carried out after three weeks! What could l do Pappu? You were there! He was saying he will go back to America. So l used any excuse to stop him! But Om, how will we make it work in two days? We have to fix the cameras on the entire set.. ..we have to build a monitor room! Everyone will have to be briefed. And even Sandy is not fully ready yet! Om l will try, but what if l make a mistake.. There can be no mistake now Sandy! He can't get away this time! We'll have to make Mukesh Mehra believe that.. ..that Shanti has come back! That's the only way he'll confess! lt's all up to you Sandy! You'll have to scare him so much.. ..that he blurts out the truth! Frankly l have serious doubts about your plan! Scaring him off! Letting him think that Shanti is back, forget it! Nothing is going to happen Om! He won't come. He will run away tonight itself! lf you want something with all your heart.. .. the entire universe conspires for you to get it! He will definitely come Om! Don't worry Son! Pappu! You go and arrange for everything! l know he will come.. ..because the film is not over yet! "There is tale l have to tell." "About a man who lost his heart, and gave up his life as well!" "The one who loves this way.." "Can he die? Even if death takes him away?" "Come, hear this fable today!!" "Once upon a time a man loved a beauty .." "..but his love for her he had to hide!"

"For the beautiful lady to be his heart's queen!" "The man had only one dream." "For the beautiful lady, to be his heart's queen!" "Little did he know, it was all in vain.." "What he thought was happiness, turned out to be pain!" "Why did this happen, and for what ..is the entire tale!" "The story goes.." "The beauty had already given her heart away." "Our man unaware, was still ensnared.." "But his dreams had to shatter one day." "Tale of shattered dreams and a broken heart left lone.." ".. is the saga of 'Om Shanti Om'!" "There is a tale l have to tell.." "The one who laughs the most, one day he cries as well.." "The beauty was, madly in love.." "ln return she was battered!" "Listen how her trust was completely shattered!" "The story goes.." "The man, the beauty had her heart on, from inside was a con!" "Because she loved a rogue.." "She was caught in his lies, and one day he left her to die!" "The heartbreak of a woman who died lone.." "..is the saga of 'Om Shanti Om'!" "Why does a murderer not understand?" "lt's a crime that cannot be buried in the sand." "lt's a stain that never will fade ,but is stamped." "And will remain etched forever on his hand!" "When the beauty was slayed.."

Guests will walk on carpets of petals and come in. There we'll have a forty piece orchestra.. .. playing Shanti's favourite songs. Over there is a fountain with champagne flowing in it.. ..instead of water! And under this magnificent chandelier, we will get married. Who are you? And how do you know all this? Ya, you said all these things.. ..to Shanti when you were alone. But there was someone else there as well.. ..who not only heard all this.. ..but also witnessed your horrifying crime! That was me Mukesh! No! That's not possible! lmpossible, but true! That night Shanti did not die alone! l died with her! Om Prakash! Who used to play small roles in your big films, a Junior artiste. l could not save my Shanti. But l will get justice for her! You will be punished Mukesh! You will pay for your sins! Sandy this is your cue. You know what to do? Yes Pappu. But l am very scared! This is no time to get scared, you need to scare other people off! Everything depends on you now. You can do it! Best of lucks! Go dear! That's brilliant OK! Fantastic! You got me! So you will send me to Prison? How ? You will stand in the court and narrate your saga of reincarnation? Why don't we do one thing, let me confess everything! But who will make me confess?! You or your duplicate Shanti? You thought you will get a two bit actress and scare me off.. .. so that l admit everything? But you see OK.. Ghosts don't get hurt, they don't bleed! So now why don't you and your goddamn Shanti go to hell! Oh God! He knows everything! Anwar stop Sandy! This bastard can do anything! Pappu the door is jammed! And you know what the problem is OK? Court of law wants evidence.. ..which you don't have. Even if l have killed Shanti, then where is her body? No one has found her body yet! And believe me.. ..OK, Om whatever! Without this evidence.. .. even God can't touch me! l will give the evidence, Mukesh!! Oh God, Sandy. Come! We were missing you! - He knows. You don't need to continue with your rubbish acting now! Go away, Sandy. - Stop this acting or else.. Else what? You'll kill me? - Sandy he knows everything, keep quiet! How many times will you kill me Mukesh? Sandy he knows everything! You just go from here. Oh, just shut up. l don't want to listen to your nonsense! You will have to listen Mukesh. And listen carefully. You came back that night! After the fire died down, you came back Mukesh! Yes l did, so what? - Sandy, listen to me Sandy. To put away my dead body! What rubbish! l wasn't dead Mukesh! l was still breathing! How do you know all this? - But you buried me alive! How do you know all this? Under this chandeliar! - Who are you?! - Stop it, Sandy! The court needs proof.. - Stop it, l said, stop it. ..they will get the proof Mukesh! They will not get anything! Right here under this chandelier, they'll find Shanti's dead body! l said shut up! There is nothing here! Which you buried that night! There is nothing here! You are going to pay for your sins Mukesh! You are going to die! Shut up! Or l will shoot you! No! No! Mukesh! Om.. you don't kill him. No! He's destined to die! He's destined to die.. ..but you're not going to kill him! No! Om! - Omi. Om! 'So you buried me alive.' 'Under this chandelier.' 'You'll find Shanti's body under this chandelier.' Om! l'm sorry! l couldn't.. - lt's ok. l couldn't.. Because the film is not over yet, my friend! Wow! Wow! - Love you!
