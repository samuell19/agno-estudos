- Get your hands off me! - Move on! - Get off me! - Come on! There's Black Jack. Let's get at him! To the gallows! Go on! All good people! All good people! Pray heartily to God for these poor sinners going to their deaths, and for whom this great bell doth toll. And you there, condemned to die, repent yourselves with lamentable tears and ask mercy of the Lord for the salvation of your soul through the mercies, death and passion of Jesus Christ. Lord, have mercy upon your soul. Lord, have mercy upon you all. Come on, children. Get a move on. This one ain't half heavy. Nice piece. Worth every penny. There's plenty of ways of earning a living but not many as strange as Mrs Gorgandy's. Mrs Gorgandy was a Tyburn widow. On the days there were to be hangings, she begged the hangman to take any unclaimed body round to her house and that's how she made her brass. The surgeons would pay up to seven pounds ten for a body in good condition. When Black Jack was hanged at Knavesmire outside York in the spring of 1750, sure enough, she was there. Half the city were there an'all. Some shops were shut and apprentices had taken the day off. They called him Black Jack because no one could pronounce his real name. He was a German, a sailor off one of them ships that bring wine up the river to York. He'd come ashore, got himself drunk and murdered a local man in a brawl. He was so strong, it killed him with one blow. Six foot six he stood, and broad to match. When he was strung up, his great bulk finished him off in seconds. And that's when Mrs Gorgandy piped up and said, "Why not take him round to my place? I'll see you right." There. - Thank you very much, lads. - That's all right, missus. He was heavy, all right. His shipmates are coming to see him tonight, you see. You've done a good thing. Thank you ever so much, lads. He's many friends, many friends. Thank you, lads. Thank you again. Good of you all to help out an old widow like me. - He was heavy all right. - You're telling me. Look. Can you see anything? - Hold his arm up? - All right. - Not a bad jacket, this. - Nice, isn't it? I don't think there'll be owt left in his pockets? Thanks, lads, ever so much. - What about a glass of gin? - No, not for me. - We haven't time, love. - Right. This is what I owed you. There you are, love. - Goodbye, Mrs Gorgandy. - Thanks, lads, very much. Thanks, lads. Goodbye. Now, then. One more favour for a poor widow. - All right. - Good lad. I just want you to stay with him for half an hour - while I get his shipmates... - I can't stop for half an hour. Look, lad, it'll only take a few minutes, if you'll just wait. There's a bit of pie in that cupboard. Finish it off, love. Make yourself at home. But I'm apprentice to a draper. I'm going to lose my job. Never mind, love. Thanks very much. He's keen on being punctual, Mr Nicholson. - Good lad. - Bye. Someone you're picking in, aprrentice to a drapper found himself guardian of the corps To past the time, he inspected the remains of Mrs Gorgandy's veal pie It looked a little staill Black Jack had cheated the hangman's noose A benched spoon in his throat did the trick Saved his windpipe from being strangled by the rope, you see The young Bartholomew was going to be even late and back to work not even for years That door's locked! It's locked. You'll not get out. It's locked. She's locked it. - You come with me. - No. Yeah, you come with me. You'll see, in my country, everybody knows me. Black Jack. That's my name. You'll come with me! And you'll speak for me. You'll speak for me. Understand? Understand? I'll need you to speak for me. - Your name? - Bartholomew Pickering. - What? - Bartholomew Pickering. Bartholomew? That is too long for me. For me it's Tolly. Understand? Tolly. Come on. Come on, Belle. What did you take your hat off for? Come on. That's better. What for? Two gentlemen have come to see you. I've been telling you about it all week. Come on, give me your hand. Good girl. - I have the child, sir. - Bring her in. Right away, sir. Can we speak freely in front of the child? She won't be affected. She doesn't understand, poor child. - How long has she suffered from her disability? - Some seven years. - She was five when it happened. - So young? And the cause of the start of it was? - It was a high fever. - A high fever? I see. - She almost died, Doctor. - And then she recovered miraculously. But she didn't recognise Mrs Carter or myself. She was strange. Very silent and very unfriendly. Then she became moody. She was sad and violent in turns. - We never knew how she would be, did we? - No. She would throw things around the room. She was very untidy. She would not use the necessary house. - We put her in a little room upstairs. - Most distressing. Mrs Carter, because she became violent, is that why you have asked for our help at this particular time? - Increasingly violent. - Yet you've managed for seven years. - Yes, well, there is another reason. - Yes, indeed. Our daughter, Kate, an older girl, has the honour to be betrothed to Lord Somers of the West Riding. Lord Somers? A very desirable match, as you can imagine. A very desirable match for any young lady. Indeed. We think so, too. You realise that we wouldn't like too many people to know about the unfortunate child there. Quite. I appreciate that. And though there may be no hereditary taint, people don't always understand such things. You may rely upon our discretion at Spring Vale. It would be as though the child had never been born. It would be as well if we were to leave soon. There may be many folk abroad before long. - I agree. As soon as possible. - We would say our farewells. - Thank you for the refreshment you provided. - Our pleasure. Come. Come, child. Come along, now. In you go. Come on. We have to push and push hard. - We can do it. - Are we bedding it down at the front? I think we're bogged at the front. - What are you going to do? - There's few people so I am going in. Do you like blood? Tolly, come back! Tolly! - Hello. Want any help? - Yes. - Very kind of you, lad. - Can you push on the other side? Let's go. - Are you ready at that side? - Aye. Keep it going. Push forward. Come on! Keep it going! Together! Push! Heave! Could you give us a hand to push the coach? We're bogged down and we're stuck. I cannot speak but... - I am strong - Very good. - And I can give you a hand. - He'll manage it on his own. - What are you doing with that gun? - It's just fallen off the carriage. Well, get it put back. Come on, let's try again. Ready? - Go on, push. - Come on. A bit more. - Come on. - There. Thank you very much. We'd have been in a right mess without you. I think we ought to have a collection for this fellow. Aye. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, madam. Thank you very much. Very good of you. We might have been set on with a set of brigands and bandits. - Anyway, must toddle on. - Thank you. Thank you. We're very grateful. Hurry along. - How's your head, sir? - Not so painful but still a bit dizzy. - It was a nasty crack, you know. - Yes. Certainly it was. In you get, madam. I'm going to give us a start at the back of the coach. Right. Away we go, coachman. Let's push from behind. It's good to be on the move again. Three pounds seventeen shillings and a silver buckle. And all that without harming a living soul. It's easier that way, isn't it? What are you going to do now? What are you doing? If you put that there, you'll kill somebody. You're right, Tolly. - That's murder, that. - The rock is money. - That rock's murder. - It's not murder. It's an accident. - You'll kill somebody doing that! - No! - What do you say? - Nowt. I hear you think. Come with me. You stay there. Stay! - Where are you going? - I'm getting my cap. Where's that child? Where is she? - Dr Jones? - It's only a stone. - Where's she gone? - Parson, will you go and try and find the child? - Where is the child? - You know I can't run. - She went this way. - Why didn't you stop her? Belle! Come back, child. - Good morning, gentlemen. - Good morning. - Do you want a hand? - We're in desperate need of help. There's a lunatic child in our charge and she's escaped. She's gone somewhere over there. There's ten pounds if you can bring her back. We have two pounds fifty here. We'll give you the rest when we get home. - Certainly, gentlemen. - You will help? Tolly! Tolly! Tolly, you are not afraid of a mad girl, are you? - A lunatic? - Yeah. You are not afraid? - Well, I don't know. - Go and bring her for the gentlemen. - Me? - Yeah, you. Of course. - Which way did she go? - Somewhere in that direction. Keep your eyes open. She can't have gone very far. Hurry, lad! He's a good lad. - He'll find her. - I hope so. Hello! Hello! Who's there? Come on, give us your hand. I use the privy. I'm clean and tidy, honest to God. Give us your hand. I'll get you back down to the coach. You can sit with horses. Come on, give us your hand. Come on. I'm not going to hurt you. - Do you see it? - What? - That. - There's nowt there. That! A tall black tower with a golden top. All the world's singing a lullaby. The sun's gone to bed in a blanket. - Look. Do you see it? - There's nowt there. - There is. Look. - There's nowt there. There is! I've seen it! I've seen it! There is! There is! Calm down. Calm now. You're mad. You must be. Mind your head. Where's your carriage? It's gone. It's gone without you. Mr Jack! Mr Jack! There's no sign of it so it's definitely gone. Where do you come from? - From where you found me. - No. I mean, where do you live? Here. If you listen closely, you'll hear them knocking at home. - What's your name? - Belle. I told you. And your name's Tolly. Isn't that so? Yeah. Have you got any other names? Yes, sometimes they call me "poor thing". Come on. Might as well make tracks up that way. We might catch them. They were heading that way. I thought we'd find them again but someone must have taken them. And... they took my magic thimble. It was a special thimble. I always used it. Never mind. I've got an uncle who lives in Hull who's a sea captain. He'll know what's best to do. Mr Jack? Is that you? I'm rather hungry. They look good enough to eat. You can't eat them. They're poisonous. - You can't eat them. - Well, I am hungry. If they were raspberries you could, but they're not. Look, there's a fair! We'll get something to eat at the fair. - No. - I'll look after you. What are you scared of? - Come on. - Only if you hold my hand. - What do you do? - I tell the future, love. - How do you do it? - In a crystal ball. You don't want to know about that. Look. That man's selling things to eat. - What are you after? - Put them down! Get off! Get away with you! How much? - You want some? - Sure I do. Two for one pence to you, sir. There you are. Each bottle containing my own name to prove that I, and I alone, am the only one who can brew this from the special formula gleaned in the valleys of my own native country and brought here by my own hand. Gentlemen, you may feel that age is passing you by. You may feel you are losing your virility. You may feel that you would like to be young and handsome again. This is for you. And, ladies, if you feel that your husband falls asleep too early at night, this is the cure for him. If it's so good, let's have some! - Boy! Come back! - I'll drink it. Come back! Stop him! Young man! It's no good, this! It's as weak as virgins' piss! Don't drink that! Stop him! It's dangerous! Don't drink it! Don't drink it! Lord, no! Bring him back! Come back, boy! Listen to what you're told. Go and see the doctor now! Oh, God! I knew when I made that, it would bring someone to disaster. Oh, God! Look what he's done to my only son! - Is that your son? - Yes. He's turned him into a baby. - I'm going to the justice now. - But, ma'am... - It's a disgrace! - But I warned the boy. I'll go to the justice and have you arrested for this. Stay there. You will all bear witness that I warned the boy. Forgive me, my friends. I must go before they arrest me. - I'll have one. - Yes, sir. Here you are. I'll have one, too. Yes, yes, yes. Please, do not detain me. - How much is it? - One shilling a bottle, sir. It'll be good for my headaches. - Give me a bottle. - Me, too. I'll have a bottle. There you go. One shilling. Thank you kindly. - No, sir. I beseech you. I'm being evicted. - Here's a shilling. Thank you, sir. - Can I have one? - You're young enough, Belle. If your spirit were any younger, you'd fade away. - Thank you. - What about me? Yes, boy? Sir, I'm wondering if you could help me. My friend is as daft as a brush. Please, no. Don't ask me again. She fell out of a carriage. They sent me to find her. Please, help her. - Where are you taking her? - To my uncle's in Hull. He was our only hope till I came across you. I thought you might be able to help. I'd be pleased to. The case interests me. - Who's he got with him this time? - I don't know. - Who's that there? - That's Hatch, my apprentice. Wasn't he that lad that was supposed to have turned into a baby at the fair? - Yes, but... - So he didn't grow smaller? People have to go to strange lengths to make a living nowadays. What kind of madness is this? - Do you want to see us all in jail, Dr Carmody? - Look, I know what you're going to say, but this is different. - Different? Who are these two? - They're just two harmless youngsters. - She's an idiot. - You're an idiot as well. Wait now. I can see big possibilities here. This girl could help me to prove my genius. - Who'll look after them? - I'll look after them. You cannot even look after us, never mind another two mouths to feed. Was there ever any question of it? I'll look after them. I'll feed them. They will not be your responsibility. - You've brought me nothing but trouble. - Get in the wagon, will you? Get that wagon open for me, so I can get in and get this baby fed. It's OK for you. Every time I try to find you, you're off with your nose stuck in a book. - For God's sake, woman, shut up. - What's your name, then? - Bartholomew Pickering. Call her Belle. - Belle. - What are you called? - Hatch. - Not got a second name? - No, only Hatch. - You coming with us? - Yes. - Others coming, Doctor? - They'll be along in a moment. Why don't you run round to Mrs Carmody, my dear? She might find you something to eat. Don't get worried by our little pretence. The money I gain from this will go to a very good cause, to further my research into the workings of the human mind and body. - Tolly! - What do you want, Belle? Quick, Tolly! Can you see that? That. Straight above. - What? - That. - A black tower with the golden top. - Don't see anything, child. With angels flying with white wings. All the world's singing a lullaby and the sun's gone to bed in a blanket. - There is no such thing. - There is. Look! - It is all in your mind, my dear. - I can see it! - Belle. Belle. - All right, I believe you. Belle. - What's going on? - I'm all right, woman. All right, now. Don't get on to me. Is this how you're going to prove your genius? It's all right. It's gone now. I'm all right now. I'm all right. - Dr Carmody. - Doctor! - Doctor, come here! - Come quickly. Come and see what's in our wagon. Come quickly, Doctor. - Come and see. - It's incredible. What can it be that's got you so worked up? I think he's a foreigner. - He's got a funny accent! - He's as big as a mountain. - Look at him. - He can pick us all up together. - Good evening, sir. - Look at him. Look at the size of him. You think I am not there but I hear you at all times. The girl is ten pounds and I want ten pounds. - Has he said owt yet? - He's a queer 'un, this one. Yes. - Where's that Tolly? - Under that caravan there with the dwarves. Why? Do you want him? Listen to me. - What happened to that carriage? - That is my affair. - Did you kill them? - No! But I know where they are. The lunatic must go to the madhouse. - But she can't... - And that's where she's going, Tolly. - She can't... - She is worth ten pounds. Understand? Ten pounds. You know what ten pounds is? She's no trouble. She doesn't cause any trouble at all. ♪ There was once an old woman tucked up in a blanket ♪ Seventeen times as high as the moon ♪ That is Belle? That is the lunatic? Yeah, that's Belle. Poor mad Belle. You're not afraid of her, are you? That's why you wouldn't walk behind us. Because you're afraid of a lunatic. - You'll not go against me, Tolly. - I ain't going with you, neither. You're not taking her to the madhouse for ten pounds. - Not for ten thousand pounds. - She'll strangle you. She'll strangle you. I know lunatics. She'll come one night and catch you unawares and... - Don't be daft. - Finished, Tolly. She's only as strong as a mouse. You bring her. You bring her when I tell you. Ow! You're hurting me. Have you all had your glass of elixir? Get off me! - Who's in there? - No idea. - Tolly! - It's all right, Belle. I'm coming. - Calm down. I'm coming. - You can't come in here. She's not dressed. She's almost naked, the shameless trollop. Where's my white sash? I'll wear my white sash. Don't be silly. Look at the mess. You'll have to clear all this up. Look, it's going through my clothes! My clothes are being eaten! Tolly! - Who's down there? - This is your fault! My clothes! Look! My clothes have gone! So it's you, you thieving rat! Hey, come back! It's the two boys. Oh, leave them. - One of them's got a knife! - He has an' all! - Be careful, Tolly! - Put that knife down! Ow, my arm! My arm! Put that knife away. Don't be stupid. You'll hurt each other. Leave him be. He's my friend. - What did he do to you? - Are you all right? What's going on? Bring it back, thief! - What's he got? - What's he got there? Come here, you little pillock! I told you when you first brought him he'd bring us trouble. - What did he run off with? - The little girl's clothing. - I wouldn't trouble, if I were you. - I knew it. If he's a thief, we don't want him in this company. Did he take anything else? Have you any money put away? Belle, there's your clothes. I want a word with you in private, lad. Hatch has run off, as you can see. I want to offer you the job he was doing for me. My apprentice. What do you say? I can't. I've got a job as an apprentice to a draper. Well, a very worthwhile profession, I must say, but there's big possibilities travelling with me, you know. My uncle's a sea captain. He wouldn't approve of this sort of life. It's not a bad life, lad. I have stuck it for a long number of years. Now, I think that you and I could make a go of it. We could hang a tinsel on every tree, so to speak. This is an offer that no money can buy or no articles define. What do you say, lad? Will you come? - Yeah, all right. - Good lad. You're a good lad. - Yes? - It's Hatch to see Dr Jones. - What about? - That girl that was lost out of that carriage. - What do you know about her? - I know that this is her shawl. You'd better come in. The doctor's upstairs. Wait in there. What did you say your name was? Hatch. The doctor will see you now. Tom, what are you doing? You know you're not supposed to be there. Get yourself off. Go on. Get yourself off. This is the lad, gentlemen. You're not the boy we sent after our charge. Who are you? Mr Hall! - This is not the lad. - Are you sure? I am quite sure. Aren't you the boy that went after the mad girl for us? - Might have been but might not have. - What do you mean? - I mean what I say. - Where is the girl now? - Has the big man got her? - He might have but he might not. Why are you being so evasive? - Tell us. Where is she? - I'm not being evasive. I came to tell you about that girl but it appears I've come on a wild goose chase. - How do you mean? - I had a look in your register. It says that you've got a Belle Carter here who's comfortable. So I think I'll go to Beverley and see the Carters. Must be two Belle Carters. You've got one because it says it in your book. We've got the other so there must be two. - What is it you want of us? - Forty pounds. - Forty pounds? For what? - To stop me from going to Beverley. How do we know that you know anything about the girl? Well, there's this. - What's that? - It's her shawl. See? It's got Carter written on it. - Her shawl? - Yeah. It's got her name there. Good lord. Dr Jones. Now then. Here's the money but we want to see the girl. - Well... - Bring her here. That could be a bit difficult, you know, things being as they are. Come and have your fortune told! Let's go over there where it's quieter. Come on, ladies and gentlemen, just one penny to see the wildest man in the world. Roll up, roll up. Who wants to win a golden guinea? Thank you, my dear. Here are four balls. Throw them at the holes. Come along, ladies. Look here. Slice of bacon! Halfpenny a slice. You want a piece from here, sir? Come on. Watch your pockets. - Don't be scared. He won't bite you. - What do I have to do? Stand over there on that side of him. - Go on! - No! Go on, throw him. Go on, throw him! - Go on! - Anybody else who's brave? I've never seen such a scared bunch. Come on! Anybody else? Madam? - Come on. - No. No! Come on, madam. This is the way. Have you got her money? Touch him on the cheek. Come on, madam. No. No. No! Come on, madam. No one else in the world, I am pleased to say, knows exactly how to transform this simple little plant into the most potent medicine ever used on a human being. You will not find it in the medical books, my friends, because the name is only known to me. So I will now ask you, my good friends, is there anyone amongst you who has a complaint, an ache? If you cannot see properly, come forward. If you cannot hear properly, come forward. Let me demonstrate on you the powers of my medicine. Now is your time to come forward. - Yes, sir? - I can't move my fingers. - You cannot move your fingers? - No. Do not despair, sir. I will just show you what is not a miracle. Oh, no, my friends. This is not a miracle. This is a cure. Try moving your fingers. Can you see, my friends? The gentleman's hand is completely cured. - Do you feel better? - Yes. You can have that free of charge, my good sir. - Thank you. - Thank you, too. And now I would like to introduce to you my elixir of youth. It is almost a miracle. Almost, I say, because people think I'm a miracle worker. I am not, my friends. I am not even a salesman. I am just here to show to you my elixir of youth. And this... Boy! It's all a load of rubbish, this. Come here, lad. You don't want to sup that. - Look, sixpence. - Thank you, madam. Thank you. You were in the right place at the right time. - Just smell that. - That doesn't smell good. Now, go and get summat from over there. - Yes? - My name's Hatch, here to see Mr Carter. - He's not at home, young man. - It's all right, I'll wait. You know very well what I mean. He's not at home to the likes of you. - He doesn't see tradesmen or owt like that. - I ain't got my card on me. Here's my bona fides. I'd appreciate it if you took it to Mr Carter. And tell him that Hatch is here. How did you come by this? In my line of work, we don't talk much, especially to footmen and the likes of them. I think you'd better come in. Son, sit there. Stay there. Come with me, young man. Well? What is it? Has something happened to her? - No, nowt's happened. - Then why has Dr Jones sent you? Well, I was passing through and I thought I'd come and tell you that everything's fine, considering. Considering what? Fifty pounds isn't enough to keep a young lady like that in the conditions she's used to. But we agreed on that money. The money you agreed with Dr Jones is between you and him. This is summat a bit different. I wouldn't like all Beverley to find out you've got a daughter that's mad and you keep her locked up in conditions barely fit for an animal. And now that your elder daughter's engaged to be married to Lord Somers, I'd hate summat to happen to that. It'd be a tragedy, wouldn't it? So I've just come here to reassure you, but that'll cost money. - Who are you? - The name's Hatch. Didn't the footman tell you? Do you work for Dr Jones? What do you do there? - I don't work for him. - How do you know my business? - How did you find my child's shawl? - Never mind. - Did you steal it? - No. Never mind how I did that. I want you to give me some money. If you don't, I'll go to certain people and tell them about your daughter. You think you can threaten me? You wretch! If you don't give me what I ask, what I know about your daughter will reach certain people. - How much do you want? - Fifty guineas. That's not much for peace of mind. Oh, and the shawl. She's rather attached to that. You say she's all right? She's alive and well? Yes, she's alive and kicking. Biting and scratching as well. Why, you impertinent little wretch! - Get out! - It's not my fault she's a raving idiot. It's you that's locked her up and disowned her. I could have asked for more. Plenty would. - But I'm keeping your lousy secret. - Get out of this house! You dirty rascal! We'll be stopping to eat soon, boy. Would you run back and tell the others? We're stopping to eat. Come on. We're having something to eat. Come on, everybody pull over. We're having something to eat. Careful. Come with me, poppet. There's still some of the elixir left in the wagon. Would you nip round and see if the others would like some? Good lad. Belle, will you pass me that jug? Ta. - Do you want some elixir, Matt? - No, not for me, Tolly. - Anybody want any elixir? - I suppose so, yes. I don't know why I drink this stuff. It's very good for you. - Very good. - I don't like it at all. It makes you strong. - Do you know what he puts in it? - Herbs. Good? He's drinking it up! Greedy swine! Bastard! He really is a fat pig, isn't he? Tell me when you've got enough. - Enough there. - Sure? - That was a relief. - Do you want some elixir? - No, thanks. - Are you sure? - Watch where you throw it, you'll burn the grass. - You burnt it up there. At least I don't bottle it, do I? "Madness from birth is a hopeless state but with madness coming on later, "there may be grounds for cautious optimism, but very cautious, "and only if there has been no history of the malady in the family. "If there is such a history, then the outlook is gloomy in the extreme, "presenting periods of well-being, sometimes quite long, "which are disastrously cut off by violence, murder or self-destruction. "This is most pitiable." Tolly! What are the names of these flowers? If you fetch them over here, I'll tell you. Let's have a look. These are blue daisies. That one's a ragwort and I hate ragworts. The small yellow one, I think that's a toadflax. I don't know what these are. My uncle would know. Your uncle would know anything. You've only to ask him a bit and he'll tell you any answer. He's always got an answer. He's a walking book. - Be quiet, Belle. Let me read. - He's the biggest memory in the world. Just because you can't read doesn't mean to say you've to stop everybody else. Stop being childish! - Look, leave me to read in peace. - I didn't mean it! Belle, come back. Don't be silly. - Come on, Belle. - Get off. Get back to your uncle. Go away! Come on. I promise you, I'll not talk about him again. - Never again? - No. Not to you, anyway. - You'll never talk about the sea, then? - Not till you've seen it. What are you like, Belle? Poor thing. Tell me about the sea, Tolly. The sea? It's water, as far as your eye can see. It rises up in great huge walls with foam on top. When it crashes down on the beach, it makes all the stones and rocks fly up. What sound does it make? It slaps and sighs and whispers, and sometimes it roars. What's underneath the sea? It's a great green forest with strange flowers and weeds and sunken ships and treasures and fishes swimming about. Why didn't you go to sea? You loved it. Well, it seemed unlucky. Me mother and father, they got killed at sea. Does it go back on you, the way you die? If your mother and father died, would you die the same way? No, it's not a malady, not like what I've just been reading about. Well, your uncle, he did a very good thing. - I mean, not letting you go to sea. - Why? Because then you would never have found me when my coach got stuck. - Do you remember that? - Yeah. - When your coach got stuck? - Yeah. You've never remembered that before. Hey, stop him! - Stop! - Run after him. - What's he done? Stop him. - He's stolen our money. Catch him! - He's got our money! - Hold him. - What's he doing? - Do you think he stole it? I don't know. Don't let him go! Get out of here and don't come back. You should be ashamed of yourself. That's no way to behave. Looks like he's stolen summat. He's a thief. Thieving swine! Get out and don't come back! I told you he was no good when he came. - He's no good all right. - Get out of here. What did he do that for? "My dear Uncle. I am sorry I have not written to you for some time. "However, several events have occurred "which have resulted in a change in my circumstances. "It is four weeks now since he has gone and still no sign of that monstrous man. "Either he has been caught and hanged again, which I hope not, "or he has taken up honest employment, which I doubt. "But to return to the girl, she continues to make progress towards being a rational soul "and her fits have disappeared entirely. "Still, all depends on whether there is a history of the malady in her family. "And this, I'm sure you will agree, I must discover "If only one might... "be sure..." Sure of what? You were supposed to be fast asleep. - I look pretty in my yellow gown. - Definitely tolerable. - And womanly. - Beautiful. Mrs Carmody says she's never seen such bosoms swell so vigorously. - That's only the course of nature. - She says it's her cooking. Well, it's not. - Don't you like them, then? - Yeah, very elegant. Go on, go back to bed. Go to sleep. - I can still see you. - You're supposed to be fast asleep. I love you, Tolly. - Go back to sleep. - Do you love me? Tell me. Tolly? Yes, Belle. - What is it? - I asked you if you loved me. You answered, "Yes, Belle." So now that's settled, when will you marry me? This year? Next year? Sometime. If you don't marry me, I'd have been better off left in the wood. And I'd have been better off dead. Listen. I'll marry you when I've passed my apprenticeship, when I've got enough money to get us somewhere to live, a house or a cottage. Or a big ship with big white sails and when the wind blows, it'll carry us across a great big sea, all clear and calm, like a looking glass. And all the stars would drop down out of the sky. That's when we'll get married. What's he doing here? - What's he doing here? - Quiet, dog! Get yourself away. We don't want you here. We don't want you here! No, leave him. Leave him. He's ill. The man's no good. He robbed the lads before. As far as I'm concerned, he's not stopping here and that's an end of it. Will you all shut up and let the man speak for himself? I am tired. And I am hungry. - Tell him. - I can't do owt for you at all. I can't do owt for you. I've no say in it. It's all right. You rest. You sleep in my wagon tonight. I'll look after you for tonight. Jed, you must be stupid if you even think about taking him. And if you do, don't expect any help from me. You're on your own, bonnie lad. Thank you. Thanks. Do you want any elixir, Jack? - Do you want some, Jed? - I'll have some, thanks. You know Belle? She's nearly recovered while you've been away. You'll not get a lot out of him today, not in the mood he's in. She's nearly recovered. She's nearly got her mind back. That might be a good idea. Fetch her round. Might cheer Jack up, the way he's feeling. - Want any of this? - What is it? - Elixir. - Go on. - Do you want any? - I don't, thanks. And don't give none to the dog. You'll poison it. Who does she think she is? There's more mystery in our Cassandra's arse than in the pair of them. - At it again with your big mouth. - What are you going to do about it? You've got a bigger mouth than Tynemouth! Get away. Your broom's in there. Get on it! - At least I don't... - I can't be bothered to argue. Mrs Carmody, can you take Cassandra back for two or three minutes? - Come on, Cassandra. Come to Mummy. - Have you got her? Just stay where you are, woman. Don't get yourself involved. I'm not getting involved. - This is Belle. - It's all right, Jack. It's all right. It's all right. She's cured. - It's all that fresh air and fine cooking. - These are for you. - It's all right. Take them. - Go on, Jack. She's picked them for you, special. - Go on, Jack. - Go on, take them. - They're beautiful. - In a few days we'll be in Beverley. And then to the sea. That sea air will do her a power of good. - Beverley? - Yeah. - It'll not be long before we're there. - Beverley? - My name is Belle Carter. I live at Beverley. - You what? - Is that your name? - My name is Belle Carter. - She's remembered her name! - Dr Carmody! What is it, boy? It's Belle. She's remembered her name and where she lives. Belle, tell the doctor what your name is and where you live. - Belle Carter of Beverley. - Belle Carter of Beverley? And my house, it was a big tall building and it had people rushing about in it. It had plenty of bedrooms and they had kind faces. Servants. And one day there was this strange thing, a dream or something. I felt as though I was dreaming, but I was awake. And the time seemed to go fast and it was standing still. And... All these huge faces seemed to be peering on me. - The onset of the fever. - Then they flew away and came back. And... It was eaten by something and there was only a little room about that big left, black. - Well... - I can't remember anything else. You can't remember what came after that? No matter. It's plain to be seen, in spite of what you said, that I've cured her. Dearly beloved, we are gathered together here, in the sight of God and in the face of this congregation, to join together this man and this woman in holy matrimony, which is an honourable estate, instituted of God in the time of man's innocence, signifying unto us the mystical union that is betwixt Christ and His church, which holy estate Christ adorned and beautified with His presence... "September 30th, seventeen hundred and fifty. "To Dr Jones of York. "Sir, you have neglected your duty and betrayed my trust. "I have been the victim of blackmail, but I will not continue so. "I would rather my tragedy be shouted from the house tops. "Therefore, I charge you to fetch back my unfortunate child, Belle Carter, directly. "I want my daughter home again without delay, sir. "Bring her" Ah, you! Just the lad we want to see. Dr Jones? What is it? You will not leave quite so much at your ease this time. There you are, you treacherous little wretch! - What's wrong? - What's wrong? - You've been blackmailing Mr Carter. - Who? Me? Yes, you. I have a letter from him here, accusing me of betraying his trust and telling me that he has been blackmailed. You've mistaken your man. He wants his idiot girl back and we haven't got her. - Now where is she? - Well... - I'm not sure about that. - How long will it take to find out? Well, it could take a long time - weeks, months even. You can have seven days, and she must be here within the week. What if I can't find her? There's no "if" about it. You'll have to. Find her and bring her here and we'll give you a hundred pounds. - How much? - A hundred pounds and... - Fifty pounds a year. - Well, let's think. It could be difficult. I'm making no promises but I'll try my best. What about some money for expenses? I'll have to do loads of travelling and persuading and all that. - Say fifty. - That's out of the question. - Ten. That should be enough. - Thirty-five. - Twenty. - Twenty-five and I'm off like an arrow. All right, if we've got it. Here, boy. - All right? - Yeah. Don't worry, gentlemen. - I'll get her here as soon as I can. - Good lad. You can be sure he's going off to Beverley, trying to get more money out of Carter at our expense. You'll have to get there before he does and explain to Mr Carter that we've got the girl but she's not fit to travel. Why in heaven's name did you give him twenty-five pounds? To try and delay him. He'll probably stop somewhere and spend some. Now, explain to Mr Carter that it's your medical opinion that the girl ought to stay here for a while longer. - Hurry. He'll have left York by now. - No doubt. If he goes through Buckden, there is time enough. - We must get to Carter first. - The wretch! - Good luck. Have a good journey. - I hope I get there in time. - Goodbye. - Off you go. - Good day. Is the master at home? - He is at home, yes. I would like to speak to him rather urgently. - Do you think he could see me? - He probably would... - Good God. - It's the master! What on earth can have happened? Doctor! - Good heavens. What's happened? - Quiet. His pulse is very faint. Could you get some blankets for me, please? Come on. Do as the doctor says. Hurry. Get me some blankets, will you? Go and fetch some blankets right away. Go and get some blankets. Good Lord! - Are you responsible for this? - Yeah, but no time to explain. - Get me out now or we're both in trouble. - Get into my carriage. As quickly as you can. There isn't a moment to lose. What's happened? Madam! William! - Madam. - No! Madam. There's nothing I can do. I don't know how this happened. It must have been an accident of some sort. So I woke him up and said that I'd come but that this was for the last time. - To get some money, you say? - Yeah. And he said, "You'll get no more money from me." And he went over to his desk and pulled a gun out and he pointed it at me. It must have been primed already because I went for his hand, knocked his hand up in the air and then grabbed hold of his wrist. He tried to shake me off and as he did that, the gun went off. But you're in very grave danger now. I think the best thing for me to do is to take you with me to the retreat. I'll give you some kind of job, helping my housekeeper. Do you mean to work at the madhouse? At the retreat. We'll keep an eye on you and see you don't get into any trouble. - Look, Belle. There's Beverley. - Is it? Yeah. That's Beverley, for sure. When we get to the town, I'll go along to the house myself and I'll have a talk with them. They'll not be very happy to see her teamed up with a fairground apprentice, though Why shouldn't they be happy about it? Didn't I cure her and didn't you feed her well? I'll go along and see them. The children can wait at the inn for me. - Does Phil Cundle come in nowadays? - He doesn't. And I don't want him in. Have you found anyone to replace him yet? - Good day to you, sir. - Well, Doctor Carmody? I'm afraid I've got very bad news for you, my dears. Mr Carter, your father, Belle... He's had... Well, there was an accident. He's dead. - Dead? - Yes. So there's nothing much we can do here. We'll go back home. Did you enjoy yourselves? - What's the matter? - The doctor's dead. - The poor girl's been so unlucky. - The doctor's dead. - There's been a terrible accident. - What's happened? - Is it true? Her father is dead? - Yeah. - How? - Accident, I think. Accident? - She was really looking forward to that an' all. - Yeah, she was. - I'll see you later. - It's been a terrible shock for her. There's something I want to tell you, boy. What I said in the inn was partially true, but I'm afraid there's more than that to it. Between you and me, I'm afraid it was not an accident. - It was murder? - Well, no, no, no. I wouldn't say it was murder, but... I'm afraid Mr Carter died by his own hand. But there's one thing. We must never let the girl know about it. Do you think Belle will kill herself? Well, now, that's what I don't know, boy. There is that possibility, you know. Madness comes down from generation to generation. I trust that you will never let her know what I've just told you. We'll keep that a secret from her as long as we possibly can. You've got too many there. Here, I'll carry some. - Don't get as many next time. - Why don't you want me to carry any? You're a girl. You're weak. Belle. Your place is in madhouse. Your father is dead, but it's not an accident. He suicided. Yeah, he suicided. - He's that mad. - You mean he killed himself? Yeah, he suicided. He's that mad. And the madness is in your blood. You say "I love Tolly" but it's not love. It's no life for him. I do love Tolly. - Do you think I should go? - Yes. Enter Dr Jones' madhouse. Go. Now remember what I told you. Eat all your food, right? Look after yourself and be a good girl. It'll not be long before we see you again. Keep yourself nice and clean. Bye, Tolly. Thank you for keeping me so long. You've been ever so kind. Bye, Tolly. - Have you seen Black Jack? - No. - Have you seen Black Jack? - No. Black Jack! You did this, didn't you? You've got what you wanted, you big fat fool! Enough. Lay off. He's upset. Give up, Tolly. Tolly! No, Tolly! Lay off the lad. He's upset. Jack, lay off him. - Tolly, it's all right. - That's what he wanted all time! - Tolly, it may be for the best. - It's what he wanted all time. - No, Tolly. It may be for the best. - You can see he's upset. Tolly. It was for the best, Tolly. - It's what he wanted. - It's very tragic but she understood. She wanted Carmody to take her. She didn't want to be here when you woke up. She loves you, you understand? But it was no good for you or for her. - Where did he take her? - Never mind where he's taken her. It's a private madhouse. She'll be well looked after. Don't worry about it. And, listen, when you go to York, you'll be able to see her. Tolly, come back! What are you doing, Tolly? - Where's he going? - Tolly, it may be for the best, lad! Come back, Tolly, lad. Just a minute! - Is Belle Carter in there? - Why? - Can I see her? - Not today. Come back tomorrow. - I've come ever such a long way. - I'm sorry, not today. - Is she all right? - As well as any of our poor souls, dear. - Let me see her, please. - Not today. Come back tomorrow. The doctor will not let you in. Come back tomorrow and we'll see. - Crikey, what a day! - You want to watch him. He's a bad 'un. - He said he'd be back tomorrow. - You know what they say. "Tomorrow never comes." Fetch some coal up. It's cold in here. "12 October seventeen hundred and fifty. "My dear Uncle, "I am sorry my news is no better than what I must tell you. "I am now in employment as a pot boy to the Black Swan "for I have ties in the neighbourhood that I will never break with." - Coming, Mr Walker. - Come here! Mr Walker, will you post my letters while? - While what? - While I shift barrels. You should have done that hours ago. - You've not been doing that in my time? - I haven't. - What have you been doing? - I just put my signature to it. Don't give me that, lad. You've been writing letters in my time. I pay you to do a job of work, never mind writing letters. - Can I see Belle Carter today? - Come back tomorrow. Well, is it all right if I leave this basket of delicacies with you? Bless you. Just put it down on the step. I'll see she gets it. - On the step? - Yes, I'll get it after. Just put it down there. I'll see she gets it. Come back tomorrow. - Can I see her tomorrow? - I'll see you when you come back. Hatch, come and see what I've got. - What is it? - A hamper. That young lad left it for that Carter lass. Meat pie with sage and onions. I love that. Look at this! I bet he got this lot at Johnson's. That's their sausages. What else is in there? - Sauce. - What do you make of this? "My dear, Belle, I've been trying..." "since..." Fancy writing a letter like that to a poor lass like her! - Like what? - A love letter. - You been at the spirits, Tolly? - No. - What cheers you, then? - Nowt, Mr Walker. About time we had a cheerful pot lad around here. Keep at it, lad. - Hey! - What, Mr Walker? - I want you. - Other than that? Come here. I want you. - I've got summat for you. - What? Give it to me. It's from my uncle. I can smell his snuff. Can I read it now? - Do you think I ought to let you? - I'll do the scrubbing after. You'd better. Go on, then, lad. - A drink, my friend? - All right. - Mr Walker? - Yeah? - What date is it today? - 8th November. My uncle's a sea captain and his ship's in York harbour today. - Can we see the landlord, please? - That's him there. Is there a lad called Tolly working here? - Who wants to know? - We'd like a quick word with him. - What are you doing here? - We've travelled two days to see you, Tolly. - Is the fair working here? - No. - It was Black Jack's idea to come and find you. - So you've got a job? Don't keep him too long. He's got a job to do out there. We just want a quick word, landlord, if that's all right. All right. Take them in the back room, Tolly. Go in the back room. - A quick word, right? - It's good to see you, Tolly, lad. - Is everybody all right? - Yeah. Two minutes. Not a second more. - Do you hear me, lad? - Aye, all right. That'll be plenty. - Been here all the time? - I've been working as a pot boy. - I haven't come to say sorry. - I'd be surprised if you had. Have you seen Belle while you've been here? No, I've tried a couple of times, but they won't let me in. So I decided to send her hampers of food and write to her, see if they'd let me talk to her. You haven't been inside? All you've done is write letters? - I couldn't get inside. I've tried. - What do you reckon to that, Black Jack? - How long are you going to carry on doing that? - As long as it takes I expect. - Wait here. - Why? Where are you going? To get her from the madhouse. - You'll not get her out of there. - What I've done, I can undo. - It's no good. You'll not get her out. - Come with me. - He's determined. - She never takes the chain off. - We'll worry about that when we get there. - You haven't got a cat in hell's chance. - We'll get her out. - Where are you going? What about my floors? She's just round the corner, but you'll not get in, Black Jack. It's here. I'm telling you, you won't get in. What are you doing here? - Have you come for the ten pounds? - Where is the girl? Where is the Carter girl? What's all that noise? What's going on down there? Where is she? Tell me where the Carter girl is. You're not allowed in. It's a private madhouse! Tolly! Tolly! Where is she? Tell me or I'll slap you! Belle? Tell me. Tell me where she is. Get back downstairs right away! - Tolly? - She's mad. - Like her father. He killed himself. - Tolly! Go away. Go away! I want them to go away. Send these people away! - Go away! - We've been expecting you. What's your name? Are you going to stay? Have you seen Belle Carter? She's a little lass, Belle Carter. Let me go. I want to go. Tell me where you're going. Go away! Go away! Belle? Belle! - Tolly, what are you doing here? - I've come to get you out. Are you all right? - Tolly! - Never mind about Tolly, Black Jack. What on earth is all this commotion? Be calm. Calm yourselves. I've given him a fright, Doctor. - I've told him how Mr Carter got killed. - You fool! You'll get us hanged! I didn't tell him I'd done it. - It was suicide. - You little liar. Where's he buried? - You'd raise the dead? Have you no respect? - Where's he buried? - Where is he buried? - You dirty great pig! He's buried good and respectable at Cornby Street. - Jack, I've found Belle. - Go fetch her. Here! Come back! Where do you think you're going? Come back here, sir. Look she's here. Look. Look, she's here. - Who are you? - I've come to get Belle. Let me talk to the man. You do not understand, sir. - Leave her. - Leave her here so we can cure her. - You don't have the authority. - She's mad, just like her father! - Leave her be. Leave her. - Come on. Come back, you two! Come back, you bloody ignorant oaf! You can't just take me away! Tolly, I don't want to go! Oi, you! You used to be a butcher, didn't you? We've got some lambs want slaughtering. - Leave the poor girl. - I don't want to go! For heaven's sake! This way. Down here. That's where they are. No, down there! No, no, this way. No, not me! No! What do you think you're doing? - Nowt, mister. - What do you mean, nowt? You're up to no good. - Come on, out of it. - Leave us alone. - What are you doing? - We want a look at this body. We've got to find out how this bloke died. - Come on. Out of it! - You can't give me orders. Will you leave him alone? - I've got a gun and I'll use it. - Out of it, come on. Where is he? Where have you taken him? I can't understand it. - He ain't in there. - The undertakers will know. - Where are they at? - Corner of Brick Lane. Skimple and Gorgandy. I bet that's that old baggage we know. It is. Oh, my God! Someone is risen from the dead! - Where is Carter? - I've seen you! - Carter of Beverley! - The one you buried two months ago. Look, it wasn't my fault. I didn't mean any harm. Please forgive me. The physicians down at Stonegate. - Come with me. Come with me! - I couldn't turn down their money. I'm just a poor widow. I've got to earn a living. Let me go, sir, please! I don't want to go, sir. Let me go, I beg you! Let me go, sir! Please! Hey, Tolly. If it's not what you hope for, what then? You mean if he killed himself? - That is possible. - She'll not know. - Believe me, she'll know. - I'll make her believe me. What are you doing, Mrs G? Are you trying to get me finished? Mr Mills, please don't blame me. I've been forcibly brought here. I'm here by compulsion. These gentlemen want to view a Mr Carter of Beverley. Names? You should know better than that, Mrs G. Just a minute, Mr Mills. I'll look at my book. Oh, dear. Wait a minute. Number 43, Mr Mills. A peep at number 43. Out of the question. We're up to number 86 now. Surely there's summat we could view to get a good idea of how he died. Well, there's the register. That may help. It gives the cause of death and the condition of the body before and after death. - Would you like to see the register? - Yes, fetch it. Just wait there. - Thomas! - Yes, Mr Mills. - Could you bring me the register? - Didn't you have it last? No, you had it this morning. Stupid lad, forgets everything. Lose his head if it was loose. - Is it there? - Wait. Here you are, sir. Well-nourished male, three and sixty years. Could this be it? Yeah. Excellent health, could have lived ten years if it hadn't been for the pistol shot through his heart. Can you tell whether he killed himself or not? No. He didn't kill himself. The bullet passed through his body, through his heart, and the larger hole is in his chest. That means he was shot in the back, which means he was murdered. He was murdered. He didn't kill himself. He was murdered after all. Mrs Gorgandy, for once you are really useful! Come, Tolly. He didn't die of madness and that means that you're not mad. - Are you sure? - I'm sure, yeah. You're not mad! Tolly, I found your uncle's ship. It's that keel over there. - Come on. - Let's go and see him. - Mr Jarvis! - No work, son. I'm sorry. Will you look harder, Mr Jarvis? I'm Bartholomew, Captain Pickering's nephew. - Bartholomew Pickering. - Bartholomew, by gum! I didn't recognise you. You're scruffy. Come on board, then, son. - Good luck, Tolly, lad. - Come on, Belle. - Go on. - You're all right, love. Belle. Take care of him. Tolly. Good luck. Bye, Tolly, lad. Look after yourself. Captain Pickering, there's a young gentleman and a young lady to see you. - Do you see it? - What? - Look. - There's nowt there. - Look! - There's nowt there, Belle. A tall black tower with a golden top and all the world's singing a lullaby because the sun's going to bed in a blanket. - Can you see it now? - Yeah, I can see it now. You see? I was right all along. It's been there all the time.
