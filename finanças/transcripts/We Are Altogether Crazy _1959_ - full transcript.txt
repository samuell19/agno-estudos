Excuse me. Aah, sorry. (death march plays) The next. Director Knud E. Joergensen. Consider that Alexander and I have been married for eight years. However, as time goes on, mother-in-law. And it goes fast when it goes well. I wish, you may I live in peace and harmony. Thank you very much. And thank you very much for the beautiful flowers. I have put them on the dining table. Alex must have his favourite supper: meatballs as his mother made them. Thank you so much, my sweet girl. When do you expect him home? Every moment. He had to meet with the tax authorities. It was set for at three o'clock. They won't approve his tax return. And they picked today? As long as his temper doesn't run away with him. Yes, his nerves are frayed at the moment. He orders way too much. He wears himself out. He has also started to lose his hair. What should I do about him? You have to give me some advice. You are an expert. Yes, you are so eternally right. Give him two Rastenil in the evening. He falls on them in a deep sleep. Then when you wake him up in the morning, you must give him three Kofiplex. They perk up a lot. They are kicking him. But then in the middle of the day you have to give him two Bedagal to calm his nerves. You stop the hair loss with Bekoxyn, - - and you keep your blood pressure down with Efinal. Now we have to hope that he will do well for that meeting. He took it very easy. He said he would give them a hard time. We have reached your car. They have deducted DKK 8,400 in depreciation and expenses. You must take up half of this amount as private driving. It will be 4,200. Mr. equalization inspectorate office manager, I am, as you know, a representative. I sell cash registers and calculators. In my little folk pot, I travel around the country to teach people, - - that it pays to have the accounts in order. For your sake. 250 days a year I am out. Do you think I need a drive afterwards? What about the expenses for your stay during those days? You have not given them up. No, because I am an honest man. My company pays for it! Then you have saved home consumption of DKK 20 per day for 250 days. It is DKK 5,000. Please make a note. Saved home consumption? What should it say? When your company pays for your meals, - - you save DKK 20 a day by not eating at home. I am a modest man. The best I know is meatballs. Note that! But I can't eat meatballs for DKK 20 a day! - Then go over to steaks. - No, I can't afford that at all! We must live extremely spartanly. We save every penny. In the backyard we grow potatoes, cauliflower and carrots. Consumption of own products: DKK 1,200. Please note. That's what I call stepping in the spinach! You have deducted DKK 400 for the repair of your chimney. The old one had been eaten away by soot. - I had to build a new one. - New construction is not repair. I had to remove the broken stones first. Just like scraping off the old wallpaper before wallpapering. DKK 400 for a brand new chimney. It sounds mysteriously cheap. And why? Because instead of taking car trips when I was at home, - - built it myself together with my brother-in-law. The DKK 400 was for materials. A master mason had cost me at least DKK 2,000. Then your brother-in-law and you have earned DKK 1,600. That's DKK 800 each. Please note. And let us get your brother-in-law's name and address, - - so we can see if he has given up the income. William Frandsen, Lykkevej 93. He hasn't got the money at all! Yet. It's his own fault. After all, he can just send the claim to debt collection. I can no more. I can no more! There is no more either. We are done. What will be the result? The gross income was stated at 31,000. From this, Mr. Alexander has withdrawn a total of DKK 12,600, - - so that the net income amounted to DKK 1 8,400. With the changes now made, there will be a supplement of DKK 5,100, - - so that the income will amount to DKK 36,100. DKK 36.100? What did you think I should pay tax on it? DKK 21,386 Plus a fine of DKK 2,000 for an incorrect tax return. - What will I do for a living? - Of the money that is left. But they are in the chimney and in my brother-in-law! Should my wife and I bite him in the arm when we are hungry? And I can't pay for a new coat from the car trips we haven't taken! I end up in a nerve clinic! We are quite aware of that. It is included in our calculations. Don't forget, you live in a welfare state that ensures the well-being of its citizens. After all, that's what the big money should be used for. For the 21,000 you have to pay in tax, you can for the entire next year - - go to school for free, go to church for free, go to the hospital for free, - - and if you are robbed, the police are at your disposal free of charge. Then send for them right away! - Write it down. - Now you mustn't be offended. But what else am I going to do with the police? I always try to avoid them. See if you come out for a crash. The police come and take a report, - - so you can get compensation paid. And why? Because you pay the police's wages. Yes, of course it's nice to know, but what will I do for a living? What do I get out of my money that benefits me at home? If you do not pay your tax, the bailiff will come and collect your furniture free of charge. Aaaaaaaaaaaah! This is theft! Robbery in broad daylight! Committed by elected street robbers! Now get down. You have to appreciate the little things in life. See how nicely our potatoes shoot in the air. Ours? Nah, it's the state's! We are only allowed to jump them. Now come down to earth again. You forget, it's our wedding day. I have decorated the table and flowers have arrived from your mother. - And you must have your favourite dish. - Yes, meatballs for DKK 20. And then I guess I'll have rhubarb sprouts right in the middle of the pan for DKK 1,200! So stop with that ashtray! I'm going crazy! I'm done! You just have a violent temper. And you have wrecked your nerves. You should take it a bit more easy. Go for a ride in your car. Then you relax so nicely. You don't have to be home before six. Then I'll cook dinner and have a drink ready. You're right. I want to drive a private car. I want something for my money. I want to go to school and church. I want to be confirmed and have the police on my heels. I want to go to the nerve clinic! Goodbye! Goodbye, Alexander. Remember to be home at six. Well, is the Jumbo family going to the forest? Yes, they are aired and bathed every day. With us, we do not keep living beings behind bars 24/7. Well, it was clear this morning, - - when the postman drove into one of your lions down the main street. It wasn't our fault. The railwaymen had placed the crane in the locked vehicle, - - so the cages went up when they had to get off the wagons. The soldiers entered the station at four in the morning with two baboons. It's the strangest lost property I've seen. (elephant commands) Birthe is right. You are an idiot. You order too much - - instead of enjoying life a little and getting out into nature. Bloody hell! There you stirred yourself up again. The creature couldn't do it because you came running. It's nonsense that it means bad luck with a black cat crossing the road. It must be more dangerous with a cow. - They drove a little hard, my lord. - Those elephants block the whole way. Surely nothing has happened to that one? - No, nothing has happened. - Thank God. How do I get my cart out of the ditch? - If you have ropes, then I have elephants. - You got elephants, then I have rope. Give it another tooth, you old man! - Are your elephants insured? - not against car collisions. Who will pay that! Then we have to let my insurance cover the damage. Well, I have to be in town at six. It was nice. Goodbye. I'll flip the meatballs while you peel the potatoes. Why don't you stay for dinner? No thanks. Even though I'm your brother, I won't bother. I'd like to drink a glass of sherry with you, - - but the turtle doves must be allowed to coo in peace. - Do you have someone to coo with? - You know that I haven't. Then get one. Many girls will be delighted to get a man, - - who can both flip meatballs and build chimneys. You know very well why it is heavy on that point. Please get out of the carriage, Mr. Good day. What kind of speed is that? They were up to over 100 in built-up areas. - May I see your driver's license? - Yes. I usually keep it in my inside pocket. I went to the cod feast today, so I changed my clothes this morning. Here it is. Sorry. There it fell. - They must have been drinking liqour. - Not at all. I've just been out to blow off some steam. And when I got up to speed, - - is it because I have promised the wife to come home for a little drink. - Have you been in an accident? - Yes. In Kolleroed Hegn, a large elephant suddenly stood in the middle of the road. And to avoid it I had to drive into the ditch. Well, did you have to? A moment. He's shit-faced. He has both been in the the ditch and seen elephants. - Well, have you been to the ditch? - Yes, so as not to attack an elephant. - How did you get the carriage up again? - The elephant lifted it up. It was a very lovable elephant when it finally came to be. - Please follow along. - Why though? The doctor can only be here in an hour. He goes crazy when he hears that he has to wait so long, he's hard enough to control already. Get him in here and I'll let him know. Mr. Alexander. The doctor can first be here in an hour. When you have passed the alcohol test, - - you are allowed to come home if you behave properly. What alcohol should I try? The doctor must determine how much alcohol you have in your blood. I haven't touched liquour since the traveling party on the chimney, - - and I can't believe there was an elephant on the road. However, take the situation like a man. An elephant is not the animal you most often meet in Kolleroed Hegn. I thought so too, but then I was in the ditch. It could probably come from a circus. I call Kolleroed Avis and listen. - If there is a call, we will call. - Then call so I can come home! - Not until the doctor has been here. - You should consult him yourself! Let me out! If you don't behave properly, you will go into the closet. It's a think box for people who can't behave properly. - Then you should have an office in there! - Inside the closet with him. Call Kolleroed Police and ask if they have loose elephants up there. Is it the police in Kolleroed? They are talking to Chief Constable Mogensen. We have a man here who claims he ran into an elephant up at your place. It still doesn't impress me. Yesterday a man drove into a lion, - - and I had to put two well-grown baboons in detention. Here, someone often comes along with a decent beer. - Should the police also be zookeepers? - Yes, it is very possible. But we must demand that the fire brigade take care of the hoses. Well, I also called just for the record. I have to give the elephant a good one over the trunk. - Let me out! - Hush it! Do you know who you are talking to? I am the one who pays your wages! You should probably get full value for it. Aaaaaaaaaaaah! It's past seven o'clock. At least he could call. He may have had an accident with the cart. He probably can't get to a phone. Take a glass to calm yourself down. I have a feeling that something has happened to him. If that is the case, then he is guaranteed to be under medical treatment. - Please count backwards from 100. - Backwards? 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, - - 93, 92, 91, 90, - - 89, 88, 87, 86, 85, - - 84, 83, 82, 81, 80. How many do you need? - Yes, thank you, that's enough. - I see. Please walk along the white line with one foot in front of the other. Should I now perform as a circus performer? It's the most mind-numbing thing I've ever been through! There you go, without net. - Didn't you see I lost my keys? - If you toss them, you can pick them up yourself! Don't forget that I pay your wages! Now tell me honestly, what have you been drinking? Two glasses of buttermilk and a coffee. Do you think I look drunk? Both yes and no. Now I name a name and an address. Notice what I say. Christian Esben Jacobsen, Class Street 88, 4th floor on the right. Please remember that. Repeat when I ask. Why the hell would I? They can just write it down, right? Do you have a car, doctor? How much do you deduct in driving expenses? It is possible that you have not been drinking. Eventually I don't believe that. But you seem out of balance. Pretty excited. Damn it, when you think about what I've been through! Just because you have soot in the chimney and cauliflower in the backyard - - and then presented to an elephant in the middle of the country road. Now I have to tell you something I didn't dare tell the police. There wasn't one elephant, there were five! One, two, three, four, five! - Excuse me for talking straight. - It does not matter. - Excuse me for talking straight! - I'll be right back. Sorry! He's not drunk. I'm certain. - Have you taken a blood test? - It will be negative. - What is the matter with him? - It clicked for him. - Can we send him home? - I will not take responsibility for that. He has lost self-control with emotions and actions. And when he thinks he sees an elephant, what can he not come up with? What do we do with him? I would suggest that he be admitted to the hospital's nerve ward. Have you spoken to the family? We won't do that until after the alcohol test, but I have to call right away. Ask if there has been anything noticeable about him today, and get his wife in here. Well, I'll go in and calm him down. Hello? Yes, it is me. No, you don't say that. Has he come to anything? Oh, sweet little Alexander... - What happened? - I do not know yet. Yes, he was terribly excited when he got home this afternoon. I asked him to go for a drive to relax. You don't say that? Then it's all my fault. - What happened? - He's had a nervous breakdown. He drove in the ditch because he sees elephants everywhere. Hello? Yes of course. I will come as soon as I can. He must be hospitalized. Do you want to go in there? Oh, no. - No, come on, little darling. - Yes, yes, now I'm coming. Mr. Alexander, we can't just let a sick man go. I'm not sick. But are you holding me back for my own money, - - then I will be. I refuse to be hospitalized! Denies! Your wife has signed the admission form. She stands at home and cooks meatballs for DKK 20! She's sitting out there and wants to talk to you. You must do everything you can to calm him down. The doctor says to just agree with him on everything. Of course we will do everything to help him. - Have you admitted me? - Yes, I had to. Did they force you? Are they all crazy? And why are you locked inside? And you, William? For a mere DKK 800? Sorry, but they forced me to hand you over. You don't have to worry about that. It will all work out. Your wife and brother-in-law are free to go. We are done with them. Then maybe I can be allowed to talk to them alone? - Can we do that? - Yes, it is fine. How do I get out? William, what are we going to do? It will be easier to slip out of the hospital. There are no officers. Let yourself be admitted, then I'll probably come and talk to you. - Do you really mean that is the way? - So I think it's the best. All right, I'll do it. Goodbye, Birthe. Goodbye, little Alexander. Birthe, you believe the elephant was there, don't you? Yes, I do. I have so often heard people talk about - - the elephants running around up in Kolleroed Hegn. Here we got a new patient last night, a representative Alex Alexander. - What's the matter with him? - Obsessions. Hallucinations. I talked to him a bit. He feels persecuted by society, - - which has upset his sense of reality - - and gave him delusions. He has started seeing elephants. Is he very excited? Last night it was bad, but I gave him a shot to calm down. (Alexander snores) Who are they? Where am I? I have to be at the office at half past nine! You are in the hospital and you can sleep as long as you want. You need rest, and we'll probably make sure you get that. - Superintendent Thoegersen. - Alexander. - Reserve doctor Jespersen. - Alexander. - Foster mother Ms. Brodersen. - Alexander. - Candidate Holm. - Alexander. - Nurse Ms. Hilding. - Elephants. Oh, Alexander. It was you who stole the clothes from me! Where is it? - You get it when you need it. - I can't run nude in the office. I have spoken to your wife. She informs the company. What do I have to lie here for? I'm not feeling sick. 36.8 and heart rate 72. Who can beat that? They are right. Physically, you are perfectly healthy. - They just had too much speed. - I have admitted that. But it was impossible to avoid the elephants! Sleep now, I'll come and talk to you this afternoon. I am going to Kolding and demonstrate our new calculator for Huttemeyer. Now slow down a bit, Mr. Alexander. After all, that's what the big money should be used for. They live in a welfare state which ensures the well-being of its citizens. Alex has been hospitalized for four days and we are still not allowed to visit him. The head doctor says he must not return to his normal surroundings, - - before he has gotten those grills out of his head. It can take a long time. I have read in one of my medical books about a man, - - there saw balloons everywhere. He was kept in isolation for a whole year. And then he jumped from the fourth floor because he thought he was sitting in a balloon. It must have been quite a special case since it was in book. Nah, it's very common. Now look at him the tram conductor, - - which comes to Christiansborg every year - - to present his new party programme. He has been there again. It was in the newspaper. It's not that bad with Alexander. He is healthy and fit in every way. He will probably soon be freed from his strange obsessions. In a little while the chief physician will come again to talk about the cursed elephants. Take them in again. Eat them alive, all five of them. It is the only way to freedom. Huttemeyer is waiting in Kolding. Good morning, Mr. Alexander. I want to be alone. - The chief physician would like to be alone. - The chief physician would like to be alone. May I be allowed to ask the chief physician a question? They mustn't laugh if it sounds crazy, - - but have I talked about some elephants here in the last few days? I'm not sure if it's a dream or something I've fantasized. You don't have to speculate about that any longer. They are going to get up a little today and go for a walk in the garden with Ms. Hilding. They are getting much better. I also feel that myself. Do you think I can come home now? Now don't pick up the pace. Then you will have strange dreams again. But I long for my wife, my house and my new chimney. Now be satisfied with the trip in the garden today. He is on the mend. My conversations with him have worked. They can go for a walk in the garden with him in the afternoon. You must be one hell of a man. To think the superintendent smoked that cigar. Playing the fool to appear normal. Why won't he say what time you have to come home and see family? Huttemeyer soon buys his machine from Soerensen and Smedegaard. Then your commission goes up in smoke, and then you can't pay tax. They are crazy here. Whoa, no! - Good day. Nice to meet you. - What do they want? Give me my birds. Yes, let's put them in here. - Where should the parrots stand? - It's budgies. Put them in the window. They did not answer who you are and what you are doing here in hospital clothes. I have jumped over the wall. I longed for my wife. - May I borrow your phone? - I have none. - They must go down to the shopkeeper, I usually do.. - It won't work in this situation. Won't you call my wife? Ordrup 4916. Ask her to come immediately and bring some clothes. Preferrably without stripes. Something tells me - - that when you don't leave the hospital through the gate, something is wrong. - What's wrong? - I am hospitalized for chicken pox. I'm in my third month there, and then you long for your wife. But you understand me, dear madam. They have heart. You carry your birds down into the sun to make them happy. Makes me happy too and brighten my day. Go downstairs and call my wife. Ordrup 4916. If you've escaped from the hospital, I don't want anything to do with you. You're lying. All right. Then I will tell you the truth. I don't have chicken pox. I lie isolated in a small room with bars for the window, - - because the chief doctor won't believe that I ran into an elephant. They also think I'm insane. They are no better than the chief medical officer and the police. But you are the ones who should be locked up! Take it easy. I'll probably call your wife. When he saw it, he turned the whites out of his eyes. I tried to remove it, but then he was over the wall. He has a hard time hiding himself in that outfit. We'll have him here again soon. - It was good you came. - Where is he? Second floor on the left. He is scrupulous. Open up, or we'll blow the doer! - Where is the kitchen staircase? - By the kitchen stairs. Hands up! Name and Address. Whoa, stop! Stop him! Well, that's you? And you are paid wages. Yes. Yes. Come. I had hoped we would only have your husband for a few days, - - but when just a toy elephant can get him into an affectation, - - then it probably runs deeper than first assumed. We must keep him for a while. Do you even think he can get well again? I have read in my books that it can take several years before a neurosis is resolved. It will probably require me to get to the bottom of his entire emotional life. I would like to ask you to give me information about, - - how his life has shaped itself from childhood to marriage. He is an extremely sweet person. A loving and caring husband. He is diligent and very interested in his work. But he can get terribly hot-tempered. Then he rolls down all obstacles. But it has also created his career. And now caused his psychic knockdown. What was he like as a child? Adorable. He weighed six pounds at birth, - - and I cared for him according to all the prescriptions in the doctor's book. We skip the first few years. What was he like from 2 to 4 years of age? Was he healthy and well? It's good, you wonder. He had measles. I made the diagnosis myself and hung up dark curtains. I gave him acetylsalesyl dissolved in chamomile tea, put him on a meat-free diet - - and dusted him all over with bromine chloride. I tied the arms in sterile gauze boiled in white iodine and distilled water, - - after which I completely isolated him. When the doctor came, it turned out, - - that they were rubella. And then he was showered with potato flour. Poor child. How did it go later? I have the family album with me. It starts with him on an ice bear skin - - and ends with a wedding photo. Now I have to tell. It is not necessary. I am going through the album with your son. - Well. Here you go. - Thanks. - When can I visit him? - He must receive a visit in a few days. Time must be terribly long for him. He is so full of initiative. That's why I put him in the living room with a harmless but entertaining patient. A tram conductor with slightly too overwhelming political ambitions. I know everything about him! He suffers from manic psychosis. No, how funny it is that my daughter is lying in the living room with him! But mother-in-law though. When you, like me, drive through the city streets year in and year out... Ding, ding! ... and see the pulverizing life, then you gain clarity and realize, - - that the whole shebang is to hell. Heard! Everyone complains that the money doesn't add up. How is the problem solved? Simply. It's in my new program statement page 2, line 8. Ding, ding! Up with the salary, down with the prices, away with the taxes! Then you must see the family going on a forest trip. Do you want to come, mate? Yes, just give me a transfer to paradise. And for the money saved by abolishing the tax system, - - the national pension can be tripled and introduced at the age of 14. The money is paid out once a month, - - and there is a prize for those who use them first! Can you hear the cash registers whirring? Ding, ding! And if the tied savings are turned into forced extra consumption, - - then I can hear the bells ringing. Where do you get those ideas from? They are hand catched on the line boo! The limit has been reached. We must create a vacuum of distrust in the government. New men must lie in the cake. One of them stands here. Is the other one sitting there? Sure, but do you think the one-chamber system can be routed from a two-bed room? And which stool do you have in mind for me? Wait, the bar has jumped off. Then there is electricity again. Minister of Housing. Raise the rent to triple, - - then people have to move, apartments become available and the housing problem is solved! - Can I count on you, mate? - No, I don't dare, you. If we call an election, the chief of medicine will probably choose to keep us in here. What nonsense. He has promised to become fisheries minister. Ding, ding! What do you think it looks like? A fish. Oh. And if I keep it that way? A fish on the head. We'll take another. What does it represent? - Two fish. - Are you making a bit of trouble now. Hold the board slightly away and up in the air. What is it now? Two flying fish. If you're going to make fun of the whole thing, we'll have to wait to see you in 14 days. I have time to wait, but then it will just take longer for you to get well. But I'm not sick! It does not surprise me that you still insist that you are not ill. People with your illness only recognize it when they have recovered. But when I already feel well, - - how do I find out when I am healthy? I'll have to tell you that. They just have to help me. I would like to. I'll try again. A dog behind a bush. You can hardly see it from the bush. Now we put those boards aside, and then you take a cigarette and relax. I will find out the events in your life, - - that has caused your neurotic state. You must tell me everything, - - what you have been exposed to and which has made an impression on you. Right from childhood to the other day, you really and mentally drove in the ditch. There will be something to talk about. Where should I start and end? I spoke to your mother yesterday. She had brought a book with her. A family album with a particularly rich picture material about you. At first, let's use these images as a starting point. Here is one. Yes, darn it. I go there in the 5th grade in Ms. Brodersen's private school. Here is Ms. Brodersen, and there are Olfert and Michael, the two labans. They were my bullies in school. I remember the terrible day the picture was taken. Tell. We lined up in the schoolyard as you always do on those pictures, - - but it was a tricky for the photographer to keep the joints in order. My mother had dressed me nicely for the photo shoot. Think I got through it. Olfert and Michael made it hell. I explained to Ms. Brodersen, that the hat was not my fault. I didn't want to be in the picture at all. The cursed page hair. When the picture was taken, Olfert and Michael wanted revenge because I told. They tied ribbons in my hair and gave me wet pants. Then they shouted: "Sissy boy, sissy boy!" I could have killed them! Trampled them to death, both of them! Did you wish you were a big, strong animal? I remember some pictures from the book where you were in the Zoo with your mom. The days at the Zoo are among the happiest of my childhood. Mother always had the doctor's book with her, and while she was reading it, - - I walked around and looked at the animals. There was one of the monkeys I loved. I called it "The Great Bastian." I admired it. It also had page hair, - - and yet it could beat all the others. In the meantime, my mother shared her knowledge of all kinds of beautiful diseases. I also liked the lions. When I saw the king of beasts with his lovely family, - - I had the greatest desire to let them out, - - so they could take revenge on those who had locked them in. But most of all I loved the elephant. I could stand for hours. I think Jumbo liked me too. Because one day my mother came and lifted me up from the grid, - - he helped me get revenge. He ate the doctor's book. But unfortunately my mother had many medical books, she collected them. Then we can finish for today. - Was the chief physician satisfied? - Brilliant, absolutely. Then we'll see each other every day between 11 and 12. Now try to calm down a bit. They can be visited twice a week and write home as often as they want. "I've settled in well now, but three weeks is also a long time." "I talk to the head doctor every day. We're almost through the family album." "I have told about you all in minute detail, - - so be careful, the superintendent won't keep you." Should a doctor squeeze all possible indiscretions out of a patient? So settled. It is the circle of friends that determines a person's development. Therefore, the doctor must familiarize himself with everything that Alexander has been exposed to. I hope he has told about all your private diagnoses. Now I have to tell you something. Had I not kept Alexander's health under keen observation,— - then he would have broken down a long time ago. And I'll probably also take care of him when he comes out again, it's my motherly duty. Then read on. "From the head doctor, I will ask mother to look up A. Simonsen's new doctor's book - - and learn page 121 by heart." No, how nice of him! And I just have it with me. - Which side did you say? - 121. I just looked it up. What does it say? "These kinds of people ruin their own lives with their hypochondria - - and is harmful to the environment, as their wisecracks - - can give even the healthiest people morbid obsessions." Why do I have to memorize it? I have to talk to the supervisor about that. Shall we continue with the letter? "You, William, we'll talk about first thing tomorrow." "I look forward to seeing the chief physician's reaction, - - when I entrust him with your life's great secret." - Are you sick? - What? Continue. "I have to say hello from my roommate, the tram minister." "He was pleased with the grapes you brought for me, - - but would rather have cigars next time." "He will give you a lecture the next time you come. See you later." When I got engaged to my wife, I was introduced to her brother. A nice guy, but he had difficulty making female acquaintances. As a young man he was out sailing. He and some friends were in a festive mood, - - and he got a tattoo. The result was longing mermaids and sinking ships all over the body. The girls shrieked with laughter as soon as he bared an arm, - - and it gave him complexes. I stand here with him. They look pretty mad in the face. What had brought you into affect? We had gone swimming together. I was, as usual, fresh and first. Stop a moment. I need to jump back a bit in the story. It was in May and the water was cold, so it was important to get in quickly. And quickly up again. I yelled at William, "Hurry now!" But then two adorable bath nymphs appeared, - - and he bothered to show them to his longing mermaids. I explained to him that this sort of thing is only to be laughed at. It was my fault he got into the water that day, - - and as a thank you he pulled me into the tub with a bathrobe and all. A strange way to treat me, isn't it? I only did it so that he would have contact with the girls. Now we both laughed at. - That's why I'm crazy about the picture. - It's something you become very easily. But like that, every human being has a soul defect. It just degenerates in a very different way. Now all we need is the wedding photo. You look happy and satisfied there. My wife is a lovely girl, but even on my wedding day there was trouble. Now take that picture. I get tired of showing my teeth. Now it was just as good. Head slightly to the right. We settle for those that are taken! I don't play fashion model all day. Let it be good now. The carriage stops down there. As you wish, sweet children. Then you make a set of test photos and send them to my home. Finally, remember the ones I myself am involved in. The marriage was not an hour old before my wife straightened her fringes, not even at home. She was so neat and tidy that it sometimes took the piss out of me. What a lot of rice grains I have on me. And in the bouquet. Kiss Me. You are also full of grit in your hair and on your clothes. No, no! Alexander though. You shake it out on the fine carpet. I put the bouquet out in the kitchen sink. Don't you know those grains are supposed to bring us luck? Should our happiness end in a vacuum cleaner on the very first night? So give me that kiss, love. (the phone) - The phone is ringing. - Let it ring, dammit. It's probably your mother. Now I have to take it. No, I'll fix her. Hello? Good day, mother. Yes, we have come home. Isn't it wonderful, sweet children, to finally be alone in peace and quiet? There is something I must tell you before I go to bed. There are cornflowers in the beautiful bridal bouquet. You get hay fever from them. I must not sleep near them. It is out in the kitchen sink. -I have to go. Well, but Birthe and I are busy. - With what, though? Yes, we shall... We're going to vacuum. How sensible of you. Dust is full of bacteria. Goodnight, Mom! So give me that kiss. How come you threw away your clothes? We have to hang that up properly. Kiss me, then! Remember to put blocks in the shoes, otherwise they will turn their noses into the air. So drop those shoes! Do you understand that I was furious? It went very well afterwards, but still, didn't it? Yes, Mr. Alexander, I understand you one hundred percent. And I have done that from the first day we started talking. Therefore, I can now also tell you what has happened to you, - - and why you drove in the ditch on 14 of July. Your dressing as a boy, Your page hair and the teasing - - gave you these pronounced inferiority complexes, - - which your fierce temper made you want to overcome, - - but in vain. Because of your mother's fuss about you, you felt weak, - - and therefore you admired the big, strong animals in the Zoo, - - and therefore the elephant became your ideal. Unconsciously you felt that if you had its powers, - - you could trample down everyone who would upset you. Throughout your existence, your subconscious has increased this desire. How often have you sat here with clenched fists and told me? Yes, that's true. The experience at the tax office made the cup overflow. Their increasing neurotic disorder was rapidly approaching its culmination. - Is that right? - Yes. They first saw a black cat running across the road. What was your first thought? That it was good, it wasn't a cow. - And when did you see the elephant? - One 20-30 seconds later. In such a short time, your subconscious has - - turned the unlucky cat into a cow - - and on to your ideal, the elephant. And thus your neurosis had sprung into full bloom. So the elephants weren't there? Was it just imagination? Absolutely right. Think I've run into five elephants that weren't there. - What an idiot I've been. - Absolutely right. Has been. I said you would only recognize it when you were well. And now you are. - Congratulations, Mr. Alexander. - Thanks. I'm perfectly fine! The elephants were not there! I have to tell Knudsen that. The elephants were not there! Goodbye, Mr. Chief Physician. The elephants were not there! The elephants were not there! I am healthy! I am healthy! The elephants were not there! I am healthy! Woouuh-woouuh! However, how complicated the life of the soul is. What would humanity do without us psychiatrists? - The elephants weren't there! - Gentlemen, you are in a hospital. The doctor has declared me healthy. Thank you for keeping my spirits up. I also have to say thank you. Besides, I've been here a lot longer than you. I thank you again. I will be discharged tomorrow, so we will have a party when my family arrives. Meanwhile, I am preparing the lecture I have promised to give to your family. How many will we be? Lady Alexander the Great. Mrs. Alexander the Little. The living painting. The hallucination expert. Sister Marilyn. The podium! Dear audience... I am not afraid to maintain, - - that we all mentally limp through life on a flat Achilles' heel. During your visit here and through conversations with the knight of the elephant - - I have had a profound insight into your spiritual status quo vadis. I will therefore give you all a much needed spiritual blood transfusion. Get up one by one. First you, Mrs. Sophie Juanita Alexander. - They're not really smart. - What do they say? You are not very clever with all your hypochondriac talk. For 58 years they have walked around in constant fear of getting sick, - - without you having succeeded in becoming one. Enjoy the hell out of life! Burn the medical books and go to Capri! Sit down and shame on you. Mrs Birthe Alexander. You have crowned yourselves as the fringe queen of the villa towns. With a flashlight as a scepter and brown soap as an apple - - have you cleaned your home for comfort and created a sterile bone wax cabinet. Heard! Do not talk to the driver while driving. They suffer from cleaning delirium. Let the floor scrub and the stove cloth rest, - - or you and your marriage will dissolve! Sit down and shame on you. Mr. William Frandsen, stand up. Since your youth some mermaids on the skin of your stomach have inflicted women's screams on you, - - which has prevented you from doing your duty as men. But now it must be over, Frandsen! Go to the macrons! How many women do not prefer a cheerful cartoon - - rather than pale fat goose skin?! Ms. Hilding, take the shirt off the patient. God, are you tattooed? Let me see, I love tattoos. Ms. Hilding is the type of woman who feels attracted - - of excessive and distinctive masculinity. Then get the shirt of the tattooed rose! - Do it now. - Knudsen is now right. Of course I'm right! - We are all crazy! - What's going on here? In order to help Mr. Alexander into "normal" life, I have proven, - - that he need not be ashamed of having consulted the head doctor. - We are all crazy! - Does that diagnosis apply to me too? Yes, Mr Fisheries Minister. We stand for freedom, equality and madness. Why do you constantly sit and break toothpicks? It's a compulsive act, you have to get rid of it! Can you then tell me how I can become one? Of course. Buy a lighter. Also send Knudsen home tomorrow. Let me be free from those people. They get on my nerves. Who would have thought two months ago that we would be sitting here tonight, happily? Mother is flying to Capri in 14 days. Knudsen has become the most popular conductor on line 16. And Sheikh William has chosen the lovely Ms. Hilding. And you, Birthe, have left the dishes standing several times. We can thank my childhood friend from the Zoo, Jumbo, for all that. When I had nervously started, he came to me like a dream vision - - followed by the whole family and had me raised from the ditch. Long live him! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! I don't understand what's wrong. It must have been in an accident that we didn't notice. When we were in Kolleroed, I went for a walk with the elephants. A car ran into her. Yes, it was the left front leg. - Why haven't you said that? - I didn't think anything happened. But I took the number of the car. I have it in the wagon. Let me get it and I'll let the police find him. It will be an expensive story for him. Excuse me, could you please tell me, the 4th division of the district court? On the first floor. They write to me that I have violated Section 256 of the Motor Vehicle Act. You don't know what it's about, do you? You will probably find out when you get up there. Well, I get to know that? Thanks. They are charged with negligence and speeding on July 14 - - to have run over an elephant in Kolleroed Hegn. - Are you starting that nonsense again? - You are in a courtroom. They must show respect for the court. Has Mr. Alexander agreed to the drive? No. Mr. Alexander drove on immediately after the accident, - - and only on one occasion did the victim manage to note down his number. - Did you try to escape responsibility? - It's perfect beep! It all stems from my school days, when I had page hair, - - and Olfert and Michael gave me water in my pants. - Please keep to the point. - That's what I do. When the two labans had destroyed my sailor's hat, - - I got so furious that my mother had to take me to the zoo. - What does that have to do with the case? - I have to tell you that. It was there that I met the elephant, but then it read my mother's medical book. I don't understand a word of it all. Was your mother in the carriage? Yes, in the tram. We drove out there on line 6. Silence in the hall! Isn't the case about a car accident? Yes. Mr. Alexander drove in a public car without passengers. Why are you trying to explain away? The report says you were alone in the car. I was seven years old when I met Jumbo, - - and the volkswagon had not been invented then. Doesn't that prove I'm telling the truth? Their childhood is irrelevant. Stick to the elephant in Kolleroed. It wasn't there at all! It was just a cat running across the road! May I ask the audience to leave the hall. Mr. Alexander, it does not apply to you. Please come back. Tell me, aren't you drunk? Now it can be enough to drive me crazy! Every time I tell the truth, they claim I'm drunk! Do I have to stand and lie in court to appear sober? No cursing in court! They must set a proper tone. Otherwise you will be imprisoned. It does not matter. Then I will be among normal people. Shall we then stick to the matter. Why would a zookeeper go to the police and tell, - - that you have driven one of his elephants? If anyone has seen elephants in Kolleroed Hegn, - - then they suffer from hallucinations or neuroses! Oh my god, we're all a little crazy. Don't you think I noticed that you are sitting and painting... ... little men behind bars? Why did you draw it? Because you suffer from the obsessive thought that you yourself will end up in there one day. That's enough! Please arrest Mr. Alexander. Give the report to the duty officer. The case resumes tomorrow. Mr. Alexander must submit to a breathalyzer test. Liquor tasting? I see. 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93... Aren't you going to throw away your keys soon? - Why? - Because we have to finish. And I have something very important to tell you. Ask the duty officer to call Station 11 and ask Superintendent Mogensen about, - - what is written in the report that was recorded concerning me - - on 14 July this year. There is the proof that it was I who spoke the truth in court today, - - and that it is the judge who should have been sitting here. Here you go! One moment, Mr. Alexander. I'll be right back. - He's not drunk. - What's the matter? I think something is wrong up here. He tells us to call Station 11 for a report from July 1 4th. You don't say that? The man is right. From what we were told at the time, there was no elephant. My Goodness! There must be a misunderstanding. We must have the new report immediately so we can compare with the old one. You have to deal with that matter. Keep me out. You have to deal with that matter. Keep me out. Go to the hospital with that case, and ask the chief doctor to keep me out. You have to deal with that matter. Keep me out. Apparently Mr Alexander was arrested on 14 July this year, - - because he claimed to have been driven into an elephant in Kolleroed Hegn, - - which the police maintained did not exist. Mr. Police Attorney, Mr. Alexander is now being prosecuted for - - nevertheless to have been driven into said piece of big game, - - which the defendant denied in such unruly terms, - - that I had to arrest him for contempt of court. What on earth is going on, gentlemen? What does the defender say? Mr. Alexander denied himself a defender. He wanted to speak his case himself. He has read both reports. Tell Mr. Alexander to come in here. Mr. Alexander. Good day. I deny that you know about the case I submitted to you. On what grounds? I must first thank you that, despite my behavior - - have complied with my wish to have the gentlemen meet here today. And must I then answer the question by asking one of the the Chief of Medicine? Yes of course. Mr. chief physician, would you be so kind as to come up here. Have I ever run into an elephant in Kolleroed Hegn? The question... You'd better address that question to... the police. All right. Can the police assistant come up here? Yes, of course. Mr. police assistant. Then you can sit down. I must ask that the superintendent also stay here. Questioning two witnesses at once is against legal practice. Isn't this whole case doing that? At least now it will be the way I want it. It had never gone on line 16. Continue, Mr. Alexander. Have I run into any elephants in Kolleroed Hegn? I only know what was in Chief Constable Mogensen's report. I see. Mogensen? And you might as well take the rest of the company with you. May I then ask you, gentlemen, and do not forget that you are speaking under witness responsibility: Have I run into an elephant in Kolleroed Hegn? Yes. It was news. I hope it doesn't cause you guys to have obsessive thoughts. When I had explained to the officers that I had run into an elephant, - - what did the chief officer say then? That you must have been drunk. And what did the police alcohol expert say about it? I maintained that you were not drunk. This means that the experts disagreed deeply from the start. And what was the result of this disagreement? - I don't know what to answer. - Then I'll help you a little on the slide. Didn't you think: "If the man is right, then the rest of us must be idiots, - - and it won't do with the salary we get. So Mr. Alexander is crazy." - Wasn't that your idea? - Something similar. Well done. Through this self-knowledge you reach a higher ethical position. And then to the heart of the matter. How does the superintendent decide whether a citizen is normal or not? Now don't get nervous. Have a cigarette. There are toothpicks here. When a person reacts abnormally to concrete events, - - one is allowed to say that he has lost his sense of reality. Thank you very much. Based on this statement, I will, on the basis of - - the gentlemen's abnormal reactions to the events in Kolleroed Hegn - - robbed you of your faith in the pensionable infallibility of the police. Back to you, Mr. Chief Physician. You probably don't have your family album with you, - - so I will stick to our conversations. They made me believe that the elephant was not there. - right? - Yeah. - They robbed me of my sense of reality. - Yes. After which you discharged me from the hospital in good health. Is this acceptable action? Or am I allowed to maintain, - - that the chief physician is not always at his full five, four, three, two... - Shall we go all the way down to one? - Can the indictment not be dropped? A case brought to court must be settled by settlement or judgment. Let's do both. Let us for once judge the witnesses and settle the case itself. Will you, gentlemen, receive a judgment that establishes, - - that even a uniformed civil servant in the citizen-financed society - - despite gold strings, shiny buttons and doctorates - - is only an ordinary human being with flaws designed for that purpose, - - which please remember, whether the citizens are to be taken into custody - - or have taken the temperature? Now don't go too far. Don't forget what happened yesterday. They are right. What do we have on paper today? I didn't think about it enough. Six witnesses in cages. You can see there. The judge feels on par with the rest of us. Because we are all known to be right: We are all crazy! Heard! Do we all have tickets? Ding, ding! Quiet down there! - Shall we deal with the case itself? - Of course. The circus director must be compensated, and I acknowledge my guilt. I will ask you gentlemen to look after my interests. Better defenders are not available. And then I say goodbye and thank you. Where are they going? I'm going out to drive a private car. --- Subtitles by Essery. ---
