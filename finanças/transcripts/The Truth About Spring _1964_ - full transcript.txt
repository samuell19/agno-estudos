- Tommy! - Yes. Steamer, starboard -How big? About 20.000 tons. Cross about a leeway or two. - Ahoy there, what's your trouble? - Water, we need water. - Mr. Boscoe, lower the ladder. - Aye aye, sir. Come aboard. Who are you, sir? Sarah Tyler's skipper, captain. We've been without water for days now. You poor boy! Yes, mam, he's kind of weak. I'll make out fine without food, but the kid, he ain't got the stamina right! You have no food? We have enough to get by, I guess, mam. Still have a few apples and a banana. - I mean food, Mr... Mr... - Tyler, mam. Mr. Tyler. I'm talking about good nourishing food, not fruit. Captain, isn't there something you could do about it? What do you think you'll need, Mr. Tyler? Well, uh-a few potatoes will help, maybe a little lard with some salt. Meat, captain. That's what they need, meat. This child needs nourishment. - Mr. Foster! - Sir? See that they get what they need. Tell the cook to take some steaks out of the freezer. Aye, aye, sir. What do you think, Mr. Foster? Didn't believe a word of it, sir. Neither did I. What's eating you? I can make out just fine without food, mam. But the kid here, he ain't got the stamina I got, uh! I'm your father. If a father can't be stronger than his daughter what else is left to it? Well, you didn't have to say it like I was some weak. Never mind about that, you just cook us something. I'm warning you, Tommy, you'd better not start treating me like a girl I mean just because I'm growing. I'm hungry, you'd better go and fry them six. Who is she, Tommy? I've never seen her before. I've seen her once driving out of Nassau. She sure is something. Yeah. You brush your teeth today? You're gonna start that again? That and a lot more I should ask. If you did what you're supposed to, I wouldn't have to keep telling you. Sure you would... just to keep in practice. Once you get hold of someone, you never let it go. It's enough to drive a boy wild. Well, it won't be any long drive for the likes of you. Spring, I've just come to the conclusion that you need a mother! It happens I know a very good woman over in Fort Myers. You wouldn't dare! She's a good woman, clean, accepting. You wouldn't do that to me! Likes everything ship shaped and Bristol fashion! She'd teach you how to dress properly, do your hair, proper way to brush your teeth I'm warning you, Tommy! Teeth! And take a bath while you're in there! You're beginning to smell like Bill Water! You're bored, William! I take no particular pride in it, but after 4 wives, I consider myself in a position to know about boredom. I didn't know you were married four times, uncle Charles. I'm not surprised. I scarcely think about that myself. It seems to me that the more times a man marries, the less weary he becomes. I can have some coffee. Here we are. - Excuse me sir. - Yes, son. A Miss Peabody would like to come aboard at Tampico. Peabody? Yes, I remember her. Shall I radio an affirmative, sir? No, tell Miss Body-Miss Peabody that although I have the utmost regard, for her innumerous charms, I'm afraid at the moment I'm incapacitated. - Yes. - No, thank you, uncle Charles I think I'll turn in. I'm sorry things aren't more lively for you, William, but you got to understand that for the time, being I need rest and quiet in the worst possible way. - Good night. - Good night, William. You don't see him, do you? No. But if I know Cark, he's out there somewhere. I'd figure he'd be out at Montego Bay. What do you think he'll do if he catches up with us? - I got a plan. - Better be a good one. - He gets meaner as he gets older. - Morning. Good morning. You're a girl! I don't know who you are or where you come from or why you're here, but if this is all you've got to say, shove off! Wow! What I mean was... from a distance you well we saw you fishing and I thought you might sell us a few. Hum, how can you sail a boat like that if you don't have any fish? - Not fresh. - You mean they're rotten? Do you mind keeping it shut for a moment? He means frozen, in ice. I'm Tommy Tyler. This mouth here is my daughter, Spring. My name is William Ashton. - Hi. - Hi. You know, I've never seen a boat quite like yours. We haven't seen another one either. I built it myself. - Come aboard. I'll show you around. - Thank you. Come on, give me your hand. Something wrong? - Had your breakfast, Mr. Ashton? - No, I haven't. Roll over there and make a steak for breakfast and take them the fish. Come on, let's go below. Roll over there and make a steak for breakfast and take them the fish. Take them the fish. Now, take them the fish. You don't have to pay them. Tommy said so. Did he really? What are you looking at? I don't quite know. Well, Tommy said to tell you that Ashton is with us today. - You shouldn't expect him. - Splendid. Simmons! Where do you usually sail, Mr. Tyler? Close to the wind. - Too close if you ask me! - Nobody asked you. Yeap! I've been 30 years in these waters, Caicos, New Orleans, Jamaica... And in all that time I'm the only thing he found and hasn't tried to trade with somebody. How can you explain to someone that she wasn't found? He invented me, just like he invented most things in this boat. Well you can't invent time, can you? I'm not saying that she's what I'm most... Proud of, but most the other things in this boat are pretty good. - Take a pole. - Thank you. You'd think that with my brains and her mouth we'd be better off than we are. How do you make your living, Mr. Tyler? Well, the fish, trade, you know, other things. - Like to fish, Mr. Ashton? - Very much. I thought I'd do some fishing out of the Dryad, but hasn't turned out that way. Why not? Well, maybe because I'm the only guest on board and I don't like to fish alone. If I'd known I might not have come along. Now, that would be a shame! Yeap! Certainly is a shame if you wouldn't get some fishing done by these waters. Got one! - Hey, hey a beauty! - Yeah. - Got him? - Yeah. Put it there. Why don't you come aboard with us for a while? - Do you mean it? - Sure I mean it. We got room. We'd be glad to have you. Won't we, Spring? Good! I'll tell you something: It won't be as if we go over there. Come on, let' see. Right! - Simmons! - Sir? - This is Mr. Tyler. - How do you do? How do you do, sir? He's invited me out for a few weeks. Where's my uncle? I believe he's in his cabin, Mr. Ashton. Would you like a steward to help you pack the luggage? No, thanks. I'll take care of it myself. Right, sir. - Some boat! - It's a yacht, Mr. Tyler. It's something, isn't it? Now take my Sarah for instance. You ought to see it when it was new. Didn't look anything like she does now. I should hope not. I mean... your mast could use a coat of varnish. Well, now, that's very perceptive of you, captain. What brand you recommend? - Condensed milk. - Yeah, for coffee, you know. Of course, if you can spare it. You don't want the coffee as well, do you? Well, now that I come to think of it, I could use... Forget it, forget it! Please take this stuff out the ladder, will you? If Mr. Skelton, sees this, I'll be... I'll be... Oh, Mr. Skelton! Don't worry about me, I'm just the owner. Tyler is the name. Your man here has been good enough to supply me with odds and ends for the fish I sent over this morning. The price of fish seem to has gone up. Is there anything else, Mr. Tyler would like? Maybe one of the diesels perhaps? Or possibly the compass? Have you lost something, Mr. Tyler? I had some cigarettes when I came on board. - Please, do have mine. - Thanks. - No, no, no, keep them. - Thank you very much, then. - Just my brand. - I'm sure they are. Won't you help Mr. Tyler lower these things? Come on, boys. They are slow, aren't they, captain? Would you care for me to assist you? No. Pretty good brand. Very good brand. Watch boys, watch it, go easy with that stuff. - Mr. Skelton. - Yes, Simmons. I can't understand how this man managed to talk me out of all this stuff. It started with the fish, then I suggested that perhaps his mast could use a coat of varnish... First thing I knew I was agreeing with him that if the mast had a new coat of varnish, he'd need some new canvas for his sail and then there was he soup. - What about the soup, Simmons? - It goes with crackers. I mean he said. Mr. Tyler said that soup and crackers go together? Something like that. Something like that. I hope you know what you are doing and I hope you know what you are doing too. We'll find out soon enough. If you change your mind, you know where we are, don't you? I'll see you in a couple of week, Uncle Charles. And Simmons, we know where you are, don't we? - You wonder if you made a mistake? - What would you say: Did I make a mistake? Judging my ignorance yes, but I'd say no. College man? Princeton. Law School. You're a lawyer? I passed my bar exams last month. Well, now, well hum. - Mr. Skelton? - Yes, Simmons. A Miss Grier and a Miss Jones request permission to come aboard. - Permission granted! - Yes, sir. This is yours. I slept here when I was young but I use the hammock since I got old. And you can put whatever you got in that bag here. - What do I do with these rags? - What rags? These are not rags. They are my clothes. Oh, I'm sorry I... Tommy spent his life collecting these things. Anyway, you don't need much on a boat. What's that? What? That with the stripes. - Pyjamas. - What? Pyjamas, you know, to sleep in. You really do? You really sleep in that? - Yes. - Why? Well, because I suppose it's customary. Everybody does. Sleeping in pyjamas is something people do without even thinking about it. That's all there is to it. People sleep in pyjamas. I don't. What time do you usually get up in the mornings? When she starts slipping around, I have to get up and let her go. I get up then. - Good night. - Good night. - Good night. - Good night. Kind of nice to have someone else on board for a change, ain't it? How come after all this time we need someone else on board? Okay with this? I mean after all these years it's nice to have someone with us. I ain't been much of a father to you have I? The day you were born I said to myself here's one for freedom. Here's one they won't get. The night you were launched I reckon, I was the happiest guy alive. I couldn't stop wondering what the finest thing I could do for you was. And then I knew, or I thought I knew. Well that fine thing is the life you have now. Only now I'm beginning to wonder if it was the right thing after all. Fathers don't usually figure on their little girls growing up. I see you have some... Good night. What are you doing here, Ashton? I finished law school last month and decided to take the cruise with uncle Charles before going to work. Aren't you hungry? How much money do you have? I beg your pardon. - You're rich, aren't you? - Well, I... - Someday Tommy and me will be rich. - I'm glad to hear it. - Tommy's got a map. - Carquinez is coming. - You sure? - Yeap, it's him all right. - He shifted his helm when he saw us. - All down the main sail. Who's it? His name is Carquinez and the schooner is the Juan Bango. It's been condemned from every port from all cities ap to Vera Cruz. I don't understand. What does he want with you? - Springer, I'm going below. - What for? Tell them I got the smallpox. That will make him shove. OK. I don't know what's going on. But if there's gonna be some kind of trouble, I'd like to know before. - What are they doing now? - They got into the dinghy. - How many? - Three, Sellers and two of the crew. What did you say to tell them? I said tell them I got the smallpox. That'll make them shove. Right! Leave it to me! Isn't anybody gonna tell me what's going on? Not now. You'll find out soon. Well, I'm afraid of... Well, well, look who's here. Where are you blowing from, Sellers? Never mind that. Where's Tommy? He's got the smallpox and died. Ah! Push off a bit! When did you say he died? Last week. Just got it and died before I could do anything about it. Buried him in the sea, dropped over the sea in Dry Tortugas. You don't say it! That's the saddest thing I ever heard. A young like you having to do a chore like that and to your own pa too. Just hearing it is enough to bring tears to a man's eyes. If he believes it. That is! Look, your poor pa didn't happen to leave a map around, did he? - Sure did. - Where's it? I couldn't make out what to do so I trade it over in Kingston for onions. Well I just think I'll come over aboard and take a look around. Nobody comes aboard the Sarah Tyler without an invitation, Sellers! Old friends don't need it. Not where I come from. All right! You got it this time. Next time, It'll be my turn. Give me a hand. And I'm not gonna forget you, mister! No, sir! I'm gonna remember you! Come any time, Sellers. Always happy to see you. You just stay anchored there. Carquinez wants to talk to you and your poor dead father. What about? Cark wants to talk. He'll tell you what about. Let's go back to Juan Bango! Buried me in the sea? You don't have to look like that. It was a decent funeral. Why did you have to tell that I was dead? Didn't tell you to say I got smallpox? What's the difference between being dead and having smallpox? But you told him I was dead without any emotion. What did you expect? I told him you've been dead for a whole week! Oh! Imagine that! Dead a whole week! If I've been dead wouldn't you be crying or something? Tommy's right, you know? He didn't believe you. If you had just told him he had smallpox... He left, didn't he? If you think they're leaving, you're dumber than I thought you were. You come down. I wanna explain something to you. Where are you going now, Ashton? Well, there's one only thing left to do: Give Carquinez shares. Shares of what? You haven't told me what the map leads to. What if I told you a wreck with maybe a quarter of a million dollars in gold. Hum? Yeap! A quarter million dollars. And old Cark want that. It's gonna be tough get away from him this time. If you show him where the wreck is, he'll grab everything and run. Maybe he will, maybe he won't. I want you to stop him from taking that map. - I don't know about this. - I explained it all to you. I don't know. It isn't exactly like fishing. Hey! Don't scratch the paint, Tyler. I thought you was dead. Didn't like the climate, so I came back. Where's Cark? In his cabin. He'll be really happy to see you. Makes a man feel good seeing a boat so well kept - like this one. Doesn't he? - Follow me. Come on! Hello, Cark! Why did you say he'd be happy to see me? Sit down! Well, let's get to it! I don't have time to squander and being here is not much of a pleasure. Who's this? My lawyer. - Your what? - My lawyer. I wouldn't come aboard without a lawyer. All Mr, Tyler tells you is true. He recently hired me to hold his affairs, particularly regarding a certain map in which he told me that you showed more than ordinary interest. I've investigated all the affairs of this case with special attention given to those areas which in law touch the disposition of procedures deriving from such map you've been given belief that is in Mr. Tyler's possession. Of course there's also a matter of legal ownership and equatable disposition as far as I'm concerned about the territorial rights. To be more precise, should this map lead to a Spanish territorial possession, it quite naturally follows... Hey, You! That the proper authority will be more than a little interested... You lost your first case, son. You go back to the Sarah, huh? I will handle from here. So, we'll do the work and will dispose of it. All you gotta do is sit back and watch. How does that sound to you, Tyler? Fine. Good, good. That's settled. We'll take two dollars out of every three. Taking is the only way you'll get it. But I don't recommend it. What do you mean by that? I want two dollars out of every three. But you aren't doing any work! I've got the map. You have the map? That's right, he got the map. If you do what I think, you're thinking it won't do you any good. Ashton is my witness. The lawyer. Tommy Tyler, captain of the... Sarah Tyler was today reported missing by his attorney... Mr. William Ashton from Philadelphia. Mr. Tyler was last seen in the company of Mr. Jose Carquinez and... Mr. Judd Sellers of the Schooner Juan Bango. Persons knowing of the whereabouts of these men are requested to get in touch with the local authorities. All right: You get two out of three. Where's the map? Roque Island? Listen, I've been there a thousand times and I've - never seen no hide or anything. - I don't reckon any marks here. It doesn't have to be marked. I know where it is. - You do, but I don't. - That's right. The only reason I'm showing you this is so you know where to go. I could tell you where to go and you wouldn't need any map to go there. And this is gonna need some dynamite, you have some, don't you? No. We'll have to get to the port for that. We'll meet you at Roque Island in a ten days. Good. It's settled. Except for one thing. What one thing? You wouldn't have a few galvanized wire on board, would you? Just to seal the contract. - What are you reading? - Les Misérables. Those French do a lot of suffering, don't they? - You read it? - Uhu... a long time ago. Why are you surprised? I'm not ignorant! - Where did you go to school? - Oh, I never went to school. Tommy taught me how to read and write. Taught me how to add and subtract too. Never how to multiply and divide. He said that would come out naturally. I didn't care much for learning arithmomancy, but Tommy made me. He said... He said education is one of the penalties of our civilization. - You like to swim? - Sure! - I'll race you to the beach. - OK. I'll get changed. Look, we don't have any spare ring-bolts! That's a shame! What do you take us for, Tyler? A marine stall? I'll tell you what: Instead I could use a little barrel - if you have one handy. - A little barrel? Yes, you know, to use as a buoy. A buoy... Go down the galley and get them one of those barrels. Thanks. By the way, one if your men will have to row me across to Sarah. My lawyer took mine. What about my front teeth? Can you make any use of them? Any gold in them? Now, take him back to the Sarah Tyler. Are you ready? I think I should warn you that I was on a swimming team in college. What's a swimming team? Where you've been, Ashton? Where did you learn to swim like that? - I swam before I walk. - I believe it. What's this swimming team you talked about? Never mind. Thank, thank you. Much obliged! Springer! Tommy's back. - What are you laughing at? - You. Kind of like having Ashton aboard, don't you? What's the joke? Cark wants us to think he's in a hurry to get to the port for the - dynamite. - Isn't he? Nah! He ain't going for the port as we are. He's heading for Roque Island. He figures he has 10 days to get down there and find the wreck before we show up. Tommy, don't you think you should explain everything to me before this goes any further? Later. Spring will have lunch ready in a minute if my nose is any judge. Why don't you say something instead of sneaking up? I'll say something: I think I can smell this fish burning all the way to St. Thomas. We'll sail this evening. Spring, after we eat, I want you to go to the shore and get us supplies for a month. Ashton can help if you like. - He shouldn't know about the gash. - Why not? He's not gonna tell anybody. How do you like him? - He's all right. - That's all? Just all right? Look, you're making me tired with all these questions, do you know that? I'll tell you: I ain't thought much about him. Haven't, not ain't. It means the same thing! A shoe means the same as a boot, but a boot's what you're gonna get in a minute. Oh, sit down, Ashton. As we fare, may others fare, Amen. Okay. Wait for this one. Now! Good! When we get rich, the first thing I wanna do is buy me a new pair of boondockers. You really think you'll be rich, don't you? You sure are something, Ashton. I guess this is the silliest question I've ever heard. I don't think it's silly. You don't realize what money could do to you. It'd complicate your whole life. What you mean is it would mess me up? Yes, I think it would. Well, I wanna be messed up something terrible. You don't mean that. I by gosh do mean it too, Ashton. Don't tell me what I don't mean. If I wanna be rich, I wanna be rich. Are you coming with me, Ashton? You can't see it, can you? - See what? - The gash. No, I don't see anything. Boy! Tommy said he had food hid over here, but didn't say it was like this. Yeap! We toot from a wreck about eight months ago. There was a storm and the ship was abandoned in the Windward Passage. She went to the rocks at Port Prince. Clearly. - Something more? - No. That's enough. If Tommy wants more, he should come and get it himself. OK. Drop the rope. Why? Because I want to get out, That's why! Oh! Suppose I don't drop it. What will you do? Come on, Spring. Let's have it. OK. Come on! Springer! Come on! It's Clearly. It's Clearly, all right. If he saw you at the beach, we lost the gash. - Who's Clearly? - Cark's partner. Drop the hook. I don't know what he's doing out here. He must be after Cark. Probably got a smell of the wreck. Yes, maybe you're right. They're always after one another. I thought you said they were partners. Sure they are. But that don't stop em from trying to do each other out of everything under the sun. - Dear old Clearly. - What do you think he wants? A leg and an arm with a little hair on each. Don't let his looks fool you. Underneath that soft exterior, there beats a heart of pure lead. I'm not playing the lawyer part this time, am I? We'll see what he's after. What are you doing here, Clearly? I was about to ask you the same thing. Who's this? - My lawyer. - Come again? William Ashton is his name. He's my lawyer. Wait till Cark hears about that. Cark already knows. - He's been here? - Sure, about six hours ago. You came from the west. You should have seen him. I saw nothing. Well, you're too late, Clearly. I've already made a contract with him. - You made a contract with Cark? - Sure. Well, I guess I've heard every thing now. And what are the terms? Shares. - You gave him the location, uh? - Yeap. Well, since we're partners, I'm sure you won't mind giving it to me. - Oh, so that's how it is, uh? - Yes, that's how it is, Tyler. I hate to be rude, but I don't have time to chat. Grab him, Ashton! Hold it! Tell them to throw those rifles overboard. Now, don't pull the trigger, son. I'm an old man, getting older - every minute. - Just tell them! Throw those rifles overboard. Come on, do as the man says. - What now? - What now? Well a little business. If Mr. Clearly here is willing to listen. When did you know me not to be willing to listen to a good proposition? All right. Cark is trying to cut you right from your share, isn't he? You can call it that, cause I got another word for that. I made the deal with Cark cause I had no choice. Go on talking. You and me together might be able to swing things a bit different. I'm listening. You know as well as I do, if we find that gold, Cark is going to try to cut me off my share as he's doing to you now. We lash together and split it down in the middle. What do you say? Is it a deal? Right! I'm with you. Now, where's the wreck? Roque Island. But you stay behind. If we go there together, old Cark is gonna get suspicious. You ain't been brought up right, child. It's sinful to kick an old man in the head. Lawyer! Go on, shove off now! At least I didn't lose this case. Oh, I was wondering if anyone was gonna relieve me. Tommy's sleeping. I'm sorry about what happened at the beach today. You know, Tommy says that when a person intends to do something, and does it that they shouldn't be sorry for it afterwards. I just did it. I didn't intend to do it. Then why you did it? I don't know. Just happened, I didn't think. Seems like you're always doing things without thinking: Wearing pyjamas, kissing. Hasn't anybody ever kissed you? You did. Nobody else would dare. - You are a girl, you know? - I'm not. What do you mean you're not? Well, you don't catch me painting myself, do you? Wearing all kinds of hooks and straps and pumping perfume all over me enough to make a pig sick of the smell. That's not all there is to being a girl. Well, it's enough to turn me against it. I'm me, Ashton. That's all I ever intended to be. So don't expect anything else. Good night. How long have you been up? Since the gulls began to fly. - What's wrong? - Nothing. Must be something. First time in your life I haven't had to turn you out. I didn't sleep much last night. That's all. - Are you sick? - No. Did you head somewhere? Then why didn't you sleep? Oh, I just couldn't stop thinking. What about? You really are something. Do you know that? I can't have a private thought with you around. Nothing you care to talk about? No. He's overhauling us. It's why he's all aboard. Trying to get ahead of us. Are just going to sit down and let us get beat by that old boat? I told him to stay behind us and now I'm gonna put him there. Ashton, help Spring get the rest of the canvas up. Come on, hop to it! Grab hold of that line, Ashton, I'm gonna jibe. Help! I'm sorry, Spring. You're not hurt, are you? What are you trying to do to me, Ashton? Nothing. The line slipped. First you kiss me, then you knock me overboard. Guilty and sorry on both accounts. You don't like me at all, do you? I'm beginning to wonder. What you mean is "no". And if you don't like me, why don't you just say it to me? Look, I apologized, I said I was sorry. What else you want me to do? Nothing, Ashton. Just nothing! I told you he'd be here. If he hadn't been, I'd lost all faith in crooks. I don't see any wreck. Over there, behind the rocks. We'll anchor up in Windward. Down it smells like a garbage scow. All right, lower the sails. Look at them all lining up to the beach. Think you can get along with Ashton for a while? I'll work at it. Where did you put that gun you took from Clearly? It's in my locker. What are you gonna do? Nothing, I hope. When you get a little pinch then you attack. If you're expecting trouble, I'd better go with you. No. You take me to the beach. Come back to stay with Springer. As long as they can't get their hands on you I think you can assure me. I got a safe deposit in Tampa with four thousand and sixty-seven dollars, and twenty-two cents. Now if it develops today and I ain't as smart as I think I am, see that she gets into some girl's school. Sure. A strict one. You're supposed to meet us here in 10 days, Tyler. What are you doing here now? You have the guts to say that to me? Where's Cark? Are you ready to show us where the wreck is? You mean to say you haven't found it? What does it look like to you? It looks like somebody's gonna have to put down 1.000 dollars - cash on account. - On account of what? On account that you two thought you could find her blast her open and leave me holding nothing. I just might leave you holding nothing now. How would you like to have another knot to your bail sentence? I should have pinched you in the head a long time ago. Let's go see Cark. Hey, enough of that, men. Tommy is on the way to the Juan Bango with Sellers. Good. I thought we'd get rid of him for a while longer. It's forever: Spring do this, Spring do that. Wash dishes cook, brush your teeth, comb your hair, don't scratch jump to sea. It's enough to make a boy give up girls. It's only because he cares about you, you know? I wish he'd care for somebody else for a change. Being cared is wearing me to a fright or so. You still angry with me? Nope. I get over things fast, specially people and other diseases. You don't think much of people, do you? I don't know many of them. But if the ones I don't know are like the ones I know, then I don't want to know the ones I don't know. This plate is the only thing that is left that belonged to my mother. Break this one. I've been trying it for years. Hello, Cark. Don't play around. What do you want that thing for? Nothing now that I'm here. Sellers was about to get a little physical with me. But you're smarter than he is. You know that wouldn't be a good thing to do. It sounds all right to me. How would it sound to the authorities when my lawyer got to talk to them? All right. Let's get down to it. Where's the wreck? Just a minute! You're gonna tell him or should I? Tell me what? Tommy's trying to beat us out of his share. He wants a thousand dollars on account. - He doesn't trust us, Cark. - Neither does Clearly. - Have you seen Clearly? - Sure. You didn't tell him anything. You didn't tell him you've seen us? Sure I told him. You don't think I'd purge my words over like to you? We're discussing a thousand dollars, gentlemen. What about this thousand dollars? You thief! Like Sellers was saying: On account. On account of what? On account that I can't trust you any more after you lied to me and break our contract. And on account that I'm having such a hard time trying to decide which way to go. And that's what Clearly wants. Is... no... is... OK. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6... Going somewhere? Yes, I'm leaving this old boat and will never come back. What are you angry about now? He goes off and leaves me alone. Never gives me a thought unless there's food to be cooked or a shirt to be patched. I thought you said you were glad to get rid of him for a while. Never mind what I said. Oh, anyway, I doubt he's having a pretty good time over there. You don't know him. When he's having the worst time, that's when he's having the best. Wait a minute. You haven't told me where you're going. Where are you going? To the shore? No. Going gulls-nesting. Where? You can't see. But there's an island this way off. You're gonna hand me that mast or I'll have to do it myself like everything else here? You mean to tell me you're going out to the ocean in this little dinghy all by yourself? You don't have to come along. I can take care of myself. - You make me nervous, Ashton. - Why? I haven't figured out yet. Cast off. Oh, we're too early. See those rocks over there? During the nesting season, that whole point is covered with gulls. The ones you see out there now are the early breeders. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe they won't come back. They do that, you know? No, I don't know much about gulls. What do you know about, Ashton? Law, politics, society. Not very much to know about, is it? Well, depends on where you live I suppose. Now, here though... doesn't seem to me much. I suppose you know a lot about girls too, uh? Not a lot, but enough to know I'm not gonna like going back. Back? Back where? Where I came from: Philadelphia. Philadelphia?! For Pete's sake! I mean, I could understand if you say you just have to go to heaven, but Philadelphia, I mean, really, Ashton?! Well, it's. Nobody has to go to Philadelphia if they don't want to. What you 're really trying to say is you don't like us. Well, I like Tommy. And I like you. And I like being with you, and believe it or not, I don't wanna go back. You do believe me, don't you? I'm hungry. Let's eat! You'll be wasting your time if you try to have that little hose in here. Put your dynamite under the sand right about here. You'll probably blow a hatch and get down the pay dirt. Listen, we only got a few sticks of dynamite, will it work? It'll work. Take my word for it. I wouldn't take your word for anything. Hello, Cark. Clearly, Tyler said he's seen you. Yes, and he got ahead of me with extra canvas, didn't you? You don't look very happy to see me, partner? What's on your mind, Clearly? Funny you should ask that knowing me as long as you have. You got any next of kin? You're to young to be playing with guns, my boy. Clearly, please, I promise you: We was going to cut you in when we got back to Panama, wasn't that, Sellers? Sure we were, Clearly. I reckon it will just cost you more to be so considerate. - Is it? What you want? - I've got what I want. The question is what do you want for your men, your tools and your dynamite? How come I not hear nothing out of you, Tyler? My mother raised me to believe that the man with the gun is the man who does the talking. I admire a man who remembers his mother. Ashton! What are you doing down there? That's a silly question! I was looking for gulls' eggs. What did you think? - Found any? - Yes. Where are they? Never mind that, Ashton. They are my eggs. I found them. OK, OK! Need any help coming out of there? - No. - All right. Then I'll just see you back at the dinghy. Ashton! Get a rope. Right. There you are. Tie it to your waist. I'll pull you up. Don't tell me what to do, Ashton. Just don't say a thing. Shove off! Don't you think it's time to stride back? It's too late to go back now. If you don't catch me, I'd be left in the dark. We'll have to wait until the morning. What are you thinking so hard of? You really wanna know? You tell me what it is, and I'll tell you If I want to know. I was wondering what my family would think about you. Oh that's funny cause I was wondering what I'd think about them. You got a big family? - Very big. - Lots of women I guess. - Lots of women. - Well, they wouldn't like me. I disagree. I think they'd kind of envy you. - Envy me? Why? - Lots of reasons: You're young, healthy and, well, let's face it: Not the worst looking person in the world. I'm not? No! What kind of future do you want, Spring? One I don't have to make for myself. Just would like somebody to... - To what? - Nothing. You sleep over there, Ashton. I'll sleep over here. Will you do me a big favour, Spring? What? Stop calling me Ashton. What am I supposed to call you? Everybody else calls me Bill. All right, I'll call you William. Thank you. Good night, Spring. Good night, Ashton. I got cold. I ain't gonna ask you why you weren't here to get supper last night and I ain't gonna ask you why you weren't here to get breakfast this morning. I ain't gonna ask you why you left the Sarah all alone without a soul on board. And I got other things I ain't gonna ask you about. You get below. I wanna talk to Ashton. - Are you going to shoot him? - Should I? He didn't do anything but keep me warm. That's what God made fire for. Tommy, if you dare to shoot, Ashton, I'll never cook for you again. I don't know what you're thinking but I can assure you... You don't have to assure me nothing. I know Springer. Well, then, what... This? Oh, this is just to keep the wolves and rats from climbing aboard. The two-legged variety as well as the four. We're gonna blow the wreck this morning. Would you like to come along? But, don't you think I'd better stay aboard with uh... Cark won't do nothing as long as Clearly is around and Clearly won't do nothing as long as you're around. He don't want no witnesses. He ain't being a fool. Hey, Tyler! They're ready. Let's go. You took long coming here, Tyler. What did you do? Back crawl? Who's gonna light the fuse? We took a vote. You are. - Me? - Yes. You didn't think I'm gonna risk one of my men, did you? - What's this? - That's the fuse. - The what? - The fuse. 10 seconds, uh? Listen, Tyler, please. I got business in Panama. Are you gonna blow it open or you're gonna stand here and argue all day? Why don't you all go over and sit in the grand stand, Cark? Let my lawyer bring the programs and hot dogs. You weren't serious about this being a 10-second fuse? Not more than 13. And I wouldn't give a bad nickel for the difference. They must have one longer than this. Yes, sure they do. They just figured out that if I blow my head off, it will make it less painful for them when the time comes to split the ride up. - You go and I light it. - You? I can run faster than you. Go ahead! Go on! Take it easy. - Oh, it's nothing. - You're sure? Sure! Slaver! Wrecked with men under hatches. Get that gear, go and see what you can find. How long ago you say, Clearly? Oh. 150 years maybe. Maybe more. Sellers, go with him. Keep an eye. - OK, Cark. - Hurry up! Now get down here. Many was the times my poor old saint mother told me the story of ships breaking up with men on their hatches, and many is the times she wept in the telling. Clearly, do me a favour, don't start it about your mother. Tell me about it, Clearly. She was a fine old lady. Sellers, you found anything yet? No! She must have been a saint. It's right of you to say that, Tyler. I noticed back in Cark's cabin you were a man who thought well of mothers. Where would we be without them? Ain't it the truth? Please, please, please, for... Pete's sake, will you both shut up? No, I think, honest it was only because of you that fine old lady went to an uneasy rest in Paradise. - You don't say! - I do say! I never knew your mother! Yes, sir. It broke her poor dear old heart when I partnered up with you. Hey, Cark, come over here. There ain't no gold in there. There's nothing at all there. Well, I guess that's it. It's all yours, of course. Just a minute. Ain't you forgetting something? Hum? No, no. Nothing I could think of. So, you'd better think some more. Because me, Jose Carquinez don't pay no thousand dollars... Put him down gently, Cark. Now, Tyler, you and your lawyer go on your way. It's not your fault if there's no gold. Oh thank you, Clearly. Much obliged. Why did you do that for? Why do you let them go away for? You know, while Tyler and me was talking I just remembered something about you. In the 20 years we've been partners I never heard you mention your mother. - Where's the gold? - No gold. - What? - Just skeletons. Skeletons? Yeap. Slaver, full of old bones. Nothing else. You mean we're not gonna be rich? You're very disappointed there's no gold? I'll get some water. - Who said there's no gold? - You did. You said there's nothing there but skeletons. I said there's nothing but skeletons here. I could show you maps leading to any number of wrecks in these waters, and who's to tell me there ain't no gold in any of them? Are you trying to tell me that map wasn't real? Real? It was real enough. Real enough to get us a thousand dollars from Cark. There goes Clearly, and there goes our insurance. I suppose Cark will be coming in for his money. No, not until it's dark. He knows I keep a shot gun aboard. And Cark ain't the type to walk through a rain of 12-gauge pellets. Now we're in for it. How we get way away from him this time? Tell me that! He'll be on us before we can pull our anchor. Have you ever seen me get us into something we can't get out of? This is the first time. You'll never see the first time. There's some bandages down below. What if it doesn't work? Then you'll never have to worry about me asking for your legal council again. Hey, look! Come here, boys. Look! Run! - Jump over! - Look out! I'm leaving. My old barrel! I personally will give 100 dollars to the first man can stop them. Hey you. Get out! Ashton, look out! Come on, get out! Behind you, Tommy! Oh, I'll get you! Right, hold on a minute. I'll get my shotgun. That'll scare them off for good. Tommy, look. Fend us off! I told you I'd get us out of this. Get the rest of the canvas up. What's Tommy doing down there? Drawing a course for tomorrow. Ah... Where are we going? South. Towards St. John's. My uncle should be back there by now. - Ashton, I... - What? Will you do me a big favour? Sure, name it. Well, when you kissed me before, well, I didn't really mind it at all that much. So, so before you go, would you do it again? I know it won't mean anything to you cause you always do stuff like that, but, well, after you're gone, I may never get kissed in my whole life. So if you have time before you leave us, will you? It's better when you don't fight, isn't it? Much better. I think so. Did you mean it when you said I'm not the worst looking thing you ever saw? I think you're beautiful. What's wrong? - Nothing. - Then why are you crying? Cause... cause, Ashton thinks I'm beautiful. He said: "I think you're beautiful". That's all he said? And that makes you sad? - I'm not sad. - You're not? I'm happy! So you won't decide anything. Tell Ashton we've sighted her. We'll be alongside pretty soon. Springer. You've become pretty fond of Ashton, haven't you? Do you love him? If he asks you to go with him and marry him, would you? - Do you think he will, Tommy? - Yeap, yeap, I think he will. But if he does and I go, what will happen to you? Never mind about that, cause there's that fine woman in Fort Myers. Last year she asked me to marry her. You wouldn't hate me then if I left you and married Ashton? I wouldn't take it kindly if you denied me of grandchildren. - Tommy sided your uncle's yacht. - I heard him. I guess you'll start wearing pyjamas again, yeah? I mean because everybody else does back in Philadelphia. I haven't really thought about it, but I probably won't. When you get home I guess you'll start sending people off to prison. I'm not that kind of lawyer. I didn't know there was but one kind. You mean there are good ones too? A few. - Spring. - Yeah? I want you to know that leaving the Sarah Tyler is the hardest thing I've ever had to do. I don't really understand it, but I feel almost as if I was abandoning ship. Doesn't make very much sense, does it? What I really mean is I'll miss you. - Will you write to me? - What about? I just wanna hear from you, know how you are. Ahoy there, Dryad! We're coming alongside. Watch the paint, Mr. Tyler. You'll never see the day, I'll scratch a paint work. Hold off there. Well it's been just great, Thanks, Tommy. Been a pleasure, Bill. If you're ever around at these parts again, look us out. Yes. Goodbye, Ashton. I.. I... Goodbye. Goodbye. - Goodbye, Tommy. - Bye, Bill. Welcome aboard, Mr. Ashton, you just made it. Just made it? We're due to set sail to Nassau this morning but one of the diesels was acting up. We'll be leaving any moment now. I'll have to put you in another cabin. Ms. Jones is occupying yours. Ms. Jones? Yes, sir. She came aboard last with 3 other young ladies. Where's my uncle? I think you'll find them all in the upper deck, sir. Well, what a surprise! I wasn't expecting you. You haven't met my little darlings, have you? This is my nephew, William Ashton from Philadelphia. And this is Miss... uh.. - Jones. - Jones, Miss uh... - Parker. - Miss Parker and Miss Grier. - How do you do? - And Miss Freeman. My nephew. Come and sit here, Willy. He was introduced to me first, darling. Oh, nonsense. He's past the age of consent. Let him decide. No fighting, no fighting! Just be nice. No fighting! Ahoy there, cast off. We wanna raise the ladder. Come on. Gotta move on. What's that, skipper? You heard me. I said cast off. You think I've got four hands? Excuse me, excuse me. We're gonna get away, Mr. Ashton. Where you're going? Just give me a few minutes, Simmons. Listen, Tommy, there's no time to explain, but will you - go along, won't you? - Go along? I mean I'll take good care of her. - Springer, will you marry me? - Yes! Where can we keep in touch with you? Better make it to General Rudder in Kingston. I get in there once in a while. You sure now, you sure you won't come with us? Well, me leave the Sarah? No, I can never do that. Besides what would Tommy Tyler be doing in Philadelphia? No, I'm fine. Still got the old maps and a very good friend in... Fort Myers. If that good old friend is the one that likes things in ship shape and Bristol fashion, then you just tell her that she can have it. You brush your teeth, you hear me? And take a bath once in a while. No Philadelphia lawyer wants his wife smelling like a wharf rat. Sorry, Mr. Ashton, we really have to go on our way. Don't worry about her. Just see that she has plenty of children, Bill. She ought to be kept busy. All right, get it up. It's Cark. Oh, this is the moment I've been looking forward to. He's got it coming, all right? Yes. What kept you? Do you think I got nothing better to do then to sit here while you've been around somewhere? I've been waiting long enough for you two. You're gonna owe me another thousand dollars. - What's he talking about? - I'm gonna kill him. Now, wait a minute, Cark. Let's hear what he's got to say first. Every time I talk to him, it costs me. It can't cost you anything this time. We're on to him. That's why I'm gonna put a bullet in his head. Come over here! I've got something you'd be interested in. It's worth a fortune and easy to get to. There ain't no way in the world he can get another dime out of me. All right then, let's just listen to what he's got to say before you kill him. Yeah, yeah... very good! Here! Keep this money for me. - Maybe we'd better go back. - And spoil his fun? You're not worried about him then? Never worried about Tommy Tyler. Thank you. She fixed me with an icy stare and she said she'd rather jump naked into a barrel of rattlesnakes. Excuse me. Uncle Charles. I must say, William, you have much better taste than I ever imagined. Come with me, my child. I want you to meet Miss Parker, Miss Grier, Miss Freeman, and Miss Jones. Of Palm Beach, darling. And I would like all of you to meet my future wife, Miss Tyler. Of Catfish Key, darling.
