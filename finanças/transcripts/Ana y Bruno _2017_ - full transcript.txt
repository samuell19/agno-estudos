ANA AND BRUNO And what color is the sky? Blue. Blue like the...? Sea. Ana, see that cloud? What does it look like? Like... a dragon. Look, Mom, a crow! And he's got friends, see? A train! A train! Are we there yet, Mom? Almost. Can I swim in the ocean, Mom? Of course you can. Where is it? I want to see! We're almost there. -Look, Mom, a seagull! -Look! Imagine flying like that. The sea! The sea! Look Mom, what a cute doggie! Hi! What's your name? Really? He says his name is Crash. Crash? I'm going to look at the ocean, Mom. Don't stray too far. Welcome. How was your trip? Not so close! It's huge! I'll be back in a few days. Try and get some rest, okay? Ana! Coming, Mom! Dad's leaving! It's amazing, Mom! Ana, you're soaking wet. He's leaving? Dad, come and see! Dad, Dad! Dad! Dad! Ana! He drove off. You know he hates goodbyes. I don't like goodbyes either. Dad has a lot of work in San Marcos. He'll come to fetch us soon. When, Mom? Soon, dear. How about the ocean view? Dad's angry at me, isn't he? Ana, there's nobody he loves more in the world but you. He always tells me so. I just wanted... ...the three of us to be together. What a face! How about a smile? No? Then... I'll have to steal one from you! You say you'll put it here and you put it there. You never get it, that's the problem. It's all about the sun, when the sun shines... No! Hey! No! Look what you did! Crash! Mom, look what Crash did! Crash! Bad dog! Can't you see he's sleeping? She's close. See? You woke him up! Hi! Look at her big head! And she's cross-eyed too! Stop making fun of her. Come on, apologize. What a nice puppet. His name is Giggles. But he's no puppet, he's alive. You're controlling it! Ha! Hear that? She says you control me! You're moving it! I don't what to hurt his feelings... ...but I'm the one who controls him. Watch. Move, Roque. Quit that! Stop! Quit it! Stop it! Ana, don't bother the nice man. Yes, Ana, stop bothering Roque. Don't be scared... I'll calm him down. -There! -Bye, big head! Wait! Giggles got away from me! Take him to the third floor. Let me go! Not the third floor! Please, not the third floor! I apologize, Madam, he needs his rest. Carry on, please. Not the third floor! No! -Oh, no! -I can't believe it. Oh, no... The man forgot his puppet. Should I take it to him? Not the third floor! Not the third floor, no, no, no! Not the third floor! Not the third floor! Not the third floor...! He disappeared, Mom. Ana, promise me you will never, ever, go up to the third floor. Ana? Crash? Crash? Doggy, is that you? Crash? Here, doggy. Crash? Okay. -What are you doing here? -Looking for my dog. -Do I look like a dog? -No, although you do have big ears Who are you? I'm Ana. Ana. Come. Ana, come, come. Ana. No! No! Go away! Please, go away! Leave me alone! What's going on here? Poncho, what's wrong? You shouldn't do that. No, no! -Well... -Go away! It's okay, don't be scared, relax. No! Look, there he is! Look, there he is! Look! This medicine will make it go away. It'll soon go away. -Calm down, relax, Poncho. -No. What's wrong with him? -He's a paranoid schizophrenic. -Schizo what? He's nuts, he's got a loose screw, he's crazy, cuckoo. It won't hurt a bit. Imagine! He thinks he sees a little green man. I can see you. Then you must be crazy too. I'm not crazy. In here, everybody's nuts... ...except me. Bruno, darling... Hey, who's this? An uninvited guest from downstairs. Rosie, Ana. Ana, Rosie. "Nice to meet you, my pleasure." What does she want, Bruno? How come she's with you? Look at me in the eye. Fifty-five, fifty-six, fifty-seven. Fifty... Hu... hurry, you're running late! You're... running late! I'd better get back to my mom. No, wait! Come with me to Giggles' goodbye party. You're taking her? Forty-nine, fifty. Fifty, fifty-one, fifty-two. Hey, everyone! Meet Ana. Hello, Ana, I'm Hugo. Nice to meet you. Hello, Bro. Who are you guys? Friends of the loonies who live here. Their friends? Yes, it's philanthropic work. We make life easier for them. We're here when they're lonely. Which is pretty often, because once they're committed... ...their families tell them they'll come back but they never do. Hugo crept out of that patient's head. When he was little, he wet his bed and his parents beat him. Hu... hurry, you're running late! Tic's friend is compulsively punctual. It seems the love of her life never picked her up to elope. The love of whose life? This pachyderm is a figment... ...of a controlling neurotic's imagination. And this hairy hand... I won't tell you why its owner was traumatized as a youngster. He... he parted too soon. Every day was a party with Giggles. What happened to him? See that man? That's Roque, he invented Giggles. He was his hallucination. -His hallucination? -His imaginary being. How did he get this way? The shrink took him to the back room... ...and plugged him to the oblivion machine to make Giggles go away. He turns on the machine, click... A few jolts. And poof! Bye-bye Giggles. Nobody laughed like he did. It would've been nice to get to know him better. He's gone, Kiddo! Now who'll be our laughing stock? Sorry, he's a bit tipsy. Leave me alone! I just need some coffee. Behave! Let me go, or I'll make you disappear! No more imaginary Mantis. His friend is a guy over in rehab. When he drinks, he sees bugs climbing all over the walls. Well, I must get going now. Forgive me, forgive me if I offended you. It's that sad music. It would even make Giggles cry. Yeah! How about something a little more upbeat? Take your dirty mitts offa me! How about some respect for the dearly departed? Giggles would've wanted us to send him off with a bang. And no tears. It's time to d-d-d... It's... time to dance! Shall we dance, little lady? May I cut in? Hey, aren't you going to dance? No! You're off b-beat! It's one, to, th-th... three! Beautifully elegant... ...my adorable pink elephant. Shut up, you mutt! I said shut up! Shut up, dog! I said shut up! Can't you see we're in mourning? -Is that Crash? -No. Run! What's the matter, sweetheart? Can't you sleep? I was just on the third floor, Mom. Ana! -I met a little green man, and... -Ana... A dancing pi?ata, a blowfish... Calm down. Why can I see imaginary beings, Mom? Am I crazy? -It was just a dream. -It wasn't! There was a... fire monster. Fire? Ana! Run, Ana! -What is it, Mom? -Get away, quick! I'll be right behind you. Is something the matter, Mrs. Carmen? The monster, it's here! Okay, let's calm down, shall we? I thought we were safe here... ...but it found us! We have to get out of here! Where would you go dressed like that, madam? Let me go! Don't let it out! There's nothing in there. Look... You like to destroy things. She'll have to change floors. Run! Let me go! Where are you taking me? To a different room, Mrs. Carmen... ...where you'll be much safer. -And more comfortable. -No... She's raving, poor thing. Yes, they get that way sometimes... ...when their husbands trade them for younger women. He must have another family already. Mom? Mom? -Mom? -Mommy? Mom? People are trying to get better! -Ana? -Mom! -Ana! -Here, Mom, here I am! Tic! Tic! What are you doing here, Ana? I told you to run! I won't leave you with that monster, Mom. Tic, time's up for this lock. Hurry! The creepy bonfire will be back! One m-more second! Give me a second! You've got to warn Dad, Ana. Go get Dad. Leave us alone! Any day now! I-I need more t-time. I-I n-need more time! Now lock it... lock it! My mom! Her mom! So, hot enough for you? Really, better cool it! Water! Water stops it! Go now, do as your mother says! -What about her? -We'll keep her safe. Oh, no! Careful, I'm not waterproof! Don't stop now! Keep the rainstorm coming! Run, Ana, run away! And at the count of th-three... ...you'll wake up and won't remember a thing. One, two and three. Hey! Move it, cows! Hey! All aboard! Bruno? You'll catch a cold! Better come inside. Easy boy! -What's our destination? -San Marcos. San Marcos? What's that, a spa? Is there skiing, horseback riding? -It's the town where we live. -A change of scenery! The clinic routine: get up, annoy the madman, let him rest... ...annoy the madman again. It was asphyxiating! -We shouldn't go back in a month. -A month? I need to be back today. -What? -I have to take my dad. Why? Is he also... ...like your mommy? Hey, my Mom isn't crazy! Then why does she see fire monsters? I saw it too, just as I can see you. Does that make me crazy? -No, what makes you think that? -You're just a kid. That's different. Sometimes, kids and animals can see us. Yeah, and drunkards too. Are you all here? We want to visit San Marcos too! We'd never leave you on your own. Who's looking after my mom? No! Goodness gracious! We'd better help her calm down before she wrecks everything. Hey, don't worry, your mom is in good hands. While we're on vacation, the doctor will shock her... ...to stop the incubus from appearing. -Where did she s-say we're going? -San Marcos. Wake me up when we get there. So... so-something's wrong. Relax, Rolex, enjoy the scenery and forget about your worries. No, no, we're going the wrong way. The co-compass says we're going the opp-opposite way. San Marcos is south. We're going north... northeast. We've got to catch another train. Another train? Tickets please! Tickets! Cover us! Tickets in hand, if you please. -I don't have... -Cover us, come on. Are you pouting or do you want a kiss? -Gosh! -May I have your ticket...? Madam! -Ti-time to go! -Oh my! Let me in, lady! Hurry, quick! They left me all alone. This way... What? Am I going crazy? Are you all right... ...doll? Watch your step! Never abandon me again! Get it? Never! Never, never, ever! -Never... -Whoa! I see two trains. Shut up, drunkard! Swear it, swear! Yes, there are two, look! South... North. That way. Th-that one is going south! All those who want to see San Marcos, now's when! You are not leaving me again! Let go, Ana needs me! Jump, Ana, jump! Careful not to fall, child. What? Who, me? Well, hello there. How's our little patient this morning? Why did you do this, Madam? Why did you wreck your room? Madam? It was the monster. The monster? You mean the "fire monster" is still bothering us? It attacked my daughter and me. Fine, tell me. Do you see a monster in this room? It's right behind you! Madam. There's nothing behind me but air. Now tell me... ...where is your daughter? -Where is Ana? -No, no! Madam? Mrs. Carmen? Oh dear! Your town isn't that bad. This isn't my town, it's the Capital. San Marcos is still ways away. It lies 78.9 Kilometers south-southwest, to be precise. So much t-time! The whole city must be nuts. The train is too fast, too fast, north to south with the sunset. -Hey! -Isn't the girl enough? You'll follow that skinny bones back to her hometown too? Ana? Where's Ana? Can you spare some change? Can you spare some change? Can you spare some change? -I don't have any. -Not even a coin? Look again. What, you don't believe I'm blind? -Sorry. -Ask your parents for some change. My dad is in San Marcos, I'm looking for a train to get to him. Oh, no, only one train goes to San Marcos per day, it left. Are you sure? I practically live here. Track seven. -What's his name? -Crash. Like me. I crash all the time. Hi, Crash. Mind if I play with him? I can't wait until tomorrow. I must warn dad mom is in danger. Well, let's go then. Do you want to go to San Marcos or not? -Just let me find my friends. -Friends? I thought you were alone, except for Crash. No, there's Bruno, Tic, and the elephant. Yeah right, I have friends too. Come now everyone! He's kidnapping the girl! You know another way to get there? How? Hey! -I'm out of cash, get a job. -How many, sir? -Five. -With everything? Yes, with everything. -Hop in! -I can't drive. I can. What? Get out of my car, stupid kid! Relax, I'm here to rescue you. I'll subdue the kidnapper. He's not a kidnapper, he's our guide to San Marcos. What? What? You were saying? Watch out! Do you want to drive? I'll teach you. -Take the wheel, take it. -Me, me! You're doing great. At this rate, we'll be in San Marcos in a heartbeat. We're gonna crash! Give me the wheel! -Let me have it! -Full steam ahead? Pedal to the metal! Hit the brakes! Not bad for your first time, but you need practice. Brake! We'll fix this. Hey, where are you going? I have to get there, even if it's on foot. Okay. We can always hitchhike. Don't forget to smile. -Does San Marcos work for you? -Yep. I like you a lot. You get me, brother. -I'm Ana. -Daniel. Thanks for bringing us, Daniel. No problem, it's not like anybody's waiting for me. No family? My parents died when I was little. You must miss them a lot. Sometimes I hear their voices calling out at the station... ...as if they were coming for me on a train from far, far away. Why not wait a little longer... ...and you'll have them both? The girl will soon be back. May we come in? Let's try on your new dress. Thanks. Run, you're free! Hey, stop tossing goats around! What? My house is on the other side of town. It has the tallest, prettiest wind vane of all! Watch where you're going, kid! Whoa, Billy-goat! Giddy up, Billy-goat! Yee-haw, yee-haw! The facade, completed in 1537, is represent-ta-tive... ...of American p-p-plateresque. The clock, made in Vienna, slows 18 se-seconds every fifty years. Take one home to your boy or girl. Miss, buy your kid a balloon. Balloons, balloons! Ah, a happy ending! The girl will run to her father, the goats to their freedom... ...and having done our good deed, we've earned some rest. Faster, please! Faster! She doesn't need you anymore, Bruno. She has a real friend now. Down, down, good boy, good boy. Hi-ho Silver! Dad! Come, come here, child. I'll take you home. It's okay now. Dad! So you found your dad? Ana? Okay then. Did you find your dad? My dad forgot about us already. That's why he left us at the clinic, we got in his way! No big deal, who needs a dad? Let's go chase some goats, okay? You don't understand, you don't get it! Since you've never had anybody! Well, I guess not, but now I have you, right? Ana? Ana? Crash? -Where are you taking me? -Just relax, Mrs. Carmen. The doctor invited you to his table. Hi! Well, what's Ponchito so happy about? He says he hasn't seen any little green men all day. No way. And he's not the only one. Maria hasn't obsessed over what time it is all day. Yes, you're right. Mr. Alejandro has also stopped talking to toilet seats. What on earth is going on? See, ma'am? Dr. Mendez's treatments really do work. Come in, madam. Sorry, I can't stand seeing people cry. By the way, what are we crying about? My dad was never coming to get us. He has another family now. That old pig! A family on the side, and in the same town. Well! We came all this way for nothing. Nice keeping you company, but we've got to go. Right, Bruno? Should we catch a train tomorrow? Tomorrow? Where will we spend the night in this one-horse town? My house! We can stay there! Come on! If you think I'll let you sleep at that boyfriend snatcher's... Listen, erasure-colored pachyderm! Ana didn't steal me from you and I'd never be your boyfriend! Can't your thick head get it? You are not my type! Guess how I like them? Like this! I'd follow her all the way to Mars! But I'd never, ever, "jamais" fall for a gigantic pig... ...with a tail in the middle of her face! And I loathe these rags... ...you knit for me! Almost there. Just over the hill. We should see the wind vane from here! What happened? I can tell there was a lot of warmth here. Dad? I miss you so much, sweetheart. Why did you leave us, Dad? Forgive me. There was nothing I could do. What happened to our house? I could never live here again. Best to leave it as it is. I have another place now. Ana. I don't mean to neglect you... ...but things haven't been easy for any of us. I... I get by somehow. But your mom... Dad, you've got to get her out of there! They want to do terrible things to her! There's nothing I can do. I'm so sorry, sweetheart. How can you say that, Dad? You're our only hope. I'll try and visit more often, okay? Goodbye. Who died? She did. Ana? She's a ghost! I'm not a ghost! I'm alive! -Then what's that? -It must be a mistake. Look at me, I'm alive! Unless... Of course! You're a hallucination! A hallucination? Yeah, just like us. I don't want to be a hallucination! There's nothing wrong with being imaginary, look at all we can do. That's disgusting! Our owners aren't doing so well... ...but their hallucinations have a blast. We're good for them, like you and your mom. She's been imagining me? Then... she really is crazy. Twice as crazy. She doesn't only have one but two friends. Well a friend and an enemy. That monster is also a figment of her imagination. -But why? -I don't know. I guess it's not easy for her to accept what happened. Can imaginary friends really do anything? If you set your mind to it. I want to face the monster... ...so my mom won't suffer and can get better. Are your wires crossed too? If she's cured, she won't imagine you anymore! R-r-remember what happened to Gi-ggles. But the monster would vanish forever too! You would both disappear. Yeah, along with everything else your mom keeps in here. Think of it as a stomach pump, madam. Once electricity floods your brain... ...all the anguish and painful memories will be gone... ...leaving you as good as new. You're going to feel a slight tingling sensation. Oh, no! And now... Let there be light! Manu! Help me. Only you can get her out of there. I must make my dad listen to me! This is it. Well, pretty big for a love nest. So how do we get in? You catch on quick! Can I enter his dreams? -Well, theoretically. -Dad... It's me, your daughter, Ana. Wake up, Dad. We have to help mom. No, you need to say it with conviction. Watch and learn. Hey! Ana's dad, wake up already. Your daughter needs you. Time to get up, lazy bones! Your daughter needs you! Wake up! Wake up, Dad! Wake up! Tic! We need time to run faster! Ho-how? I can hardly walk. Sorry, brother. Yes, yes, wake up, Dad! Hurry up! Why so early, Mr. Ricardo? I overslept, I'm running late. -It's 6:30 already. -I'll make you some breakfast. No! No thanks, I have to run. Absolutely not. No guest of mine leaves this house on an empty stomach. It's a guest house, not a love nest! It won't take a minute. No, Bruno! Well, I could use a bite. You must take better care of yourself. How much weight have you lost? I don't know, I don't even know what day it is. -Have I paid you this week? -Don't worry about it, Mr. Ricardo. I insist. You have enough expenses with your wife needing care. That's it, remember mom! You can pay me later. I dreamed of Ana. It was so real... ...as if she were right next to my bed. Oh, Mr. Ricardo! It worked, Bruno, it worked! Hey, how did you do that? You must teach me. It wasn't a dream, I'm here! -I should visit her more often. -Not me, mom! Go get her! And how is Mrs. Carmen doing? The doctor promised to do everything in his power. They say he's the best, with state-of-the-art methods. Slicing your brain up and toasting it! But it takes time. -I'll visit her at the month's end. -No, it'll be too late! We've got to do something! It's seven already? Poof, time flies by! Now I really must go! -Mom? -I'll be right there, honey. My goodness! It's so cloudy. -Must you go out today, Mr. Ricardo? -Yes, Dad, yes! Yes, Dad. I mean... yes, Mrs. Emilia. I really must go. Thank you. Oh no! I didn't set the goats free, officer, I was just leaving. Crash? What are you doing here? Did Ana leave you too? Do something, patch them up, turn yourselves into tires! Hey, we're not made of rubber! -Need a hand? -Could you lend me your spare? -Going on a trip? -Just to the city. Not to the city, Dad, no! Rosie would pick this up in the blink of an eye. Oh, where could she be? We need a hand! Daniel? Wait for me, Daniel! Where are you going? I need you to help me with my dad! He'll listen to you! Tell him he needs to go get my mom! Did you hear me, Daniel? Daniel, did you hear me? I heard you, I'm not deaf. Look, something you learn when you've got nobody... ...is you actually don't need anybody. Yesterday, some girl I met asked me to take her to her home town. And what thanks did I get? She booted me in a strange place... ...no roof, no one around. The scenery apparently was really something. But I survived, as always. I guess you can figure it out on your own. Sorry, I didn't mean to abandon you. It's all been... so fast. Forgive me, you have every right to be angry. But you're not alone. There are more beings than you can imagine all around us. We're not alone, Daniel, we can't handle everything by ourselves. Dad! Is he leaving? Yes! New record in tire changing! -Wait for me, Dad! -Huh? Huh? Oh! Wait for us! Dad! Get out of my way! Why did you do that? I thought she'd get run over. How could she? She was behind the car! Why did you do it? Out of love! I did it out of love! Daniel! How about a spin? Hop on! Hey! Come back, give her back to me! There goes my dad! Catch up to him! You missed the turn! He got away. What did you say? He got away! I'm useless. It's not your fault, he wouldn't listen to me. I'm sorry, Ana. The train! -Where? -That way! Hold on tight! Go left! -Am I doing okay? -Yes. Take care of him for me. Yes, I'll take care of him, now hop on! Did you jump already? -Daniel... -I'm coming too. Bye, Ana! Great, Ana! You made it! Well done! -Hurrah! -Well done! No... Rosie? Why did they do this to you? She can't be trusted, she flattened your dad's tires. I did it out of love, Bruno! Out of love! This is all your fault. Yeah, sure, I was wrong. I'm sorry, okay? No, it's your fault for letting Bruno treat you this way. Find someone who really loves you. You ought to be ashamed of yourself! I was helping you get to the clinic quickly, without setbacks. If you really want to help... ...teach me to disappear and reappear someplace else, like you. I'll teach you. -What are you up to now? -I want to help. First, you take a deep breath. Hey, wouldn't you rather have me as your teacher? Second, you have to really... ...really want it. Focus on your target, don't lose sight of it! I want to be in the clinic, I want to be in the clinic. -I want to be in the clinic. -And then, you are simply there. -You're there. -I'm there, I'm there! -She did it! -She did it, she did it! -She did it! -Ana did it, she did it, she did it! Well, it was good for starters. Here comes a big one, smile, Crash. Careful, Crash. -Are you all right? -I'm fine, and you? Are you headed for the city? If you're tired, I can drive, okay? You can drive? Sure! Motorbikes, trucks, tractors, convertibles... Not planes though, but if you teach me... How do you see the road? I imagine it. Your dog seems familiar. It's Ana's, I'm just taking care of it. Ana? A girl I helped get to San Marcos to find her dad. I had a daughter called Ana. What happened to her? One night, while we were asleep, there was a short circuit. By the time the smoke woke me up, the house was burning. I need to stretch my legs. -Can you see the ocean from here? -No. I promised I'd convince my friend's father... ...to pick up his wife at the seaside. Apparently, she really needs him. Prepare the patient. Are we there yet? -Almost, almost. -It-it's almost five o'clock. That's when the doctor does his t-t-treatments! Tickets in hand. Tickets if you please... Look what's in here! Allow me, beautiful. The weather's get-getting w-worse! Mom! Ana! Ana, hurry! Stop the doctor! Now let's get rid of that awful fire monster, for good! -Mom! -Ana! We'll erase that girl too. -Where's dad? -I don't know, he wouldn't come. Is this the city? Wait here. Carmen! -I'm here for my wife. -You can't see her now. The doctor is treating her. Hey, wait! Hey! They're too tight. Keep trying, Ana. What is it that Ana is trying to do, madam? Hush, you're making it worse. Don't talk to me anymore. You've got to accept what happened, Mom. Ana... Time to say goodbye to Ana. Carmen? Dad? I'm here! Ricardo, over here! Hey! You have no right! Get out of here! What are you doing to my wife? Let her go! Forgive me for leaving you here. You cannot interrupt the treatment. I have your written authorization! Let me go! Let me go, no! Great opportunity... to cure them both. Tie him to the chair! You could use a few charges... ...to calm that aggression. You can't do this without our consent! When the person responsible for one of our patients... ...also loses his mind... ...it's our moral duty to assist him. No! We've got to get them out of there! You go! We'll take care of the flying wok! B-b-but how? I know someone who can help us! Let's say goodbye to Ponchito... ...who is ready to go back to the outside world. -Hi! -Right, Mr. Poncho? Yes, uh-huh, yes. Mr. Poncho? There, there! There! There! Listen, you quack! All those sleepless nights, between padded walls of this clinic... ...who's the only one who never left your side? You? In your times of crisis, who was there all along? -You. -Well, now I need your help. And you'd better, or else... ...I swear I'll torture you each hour of every day... ...no matter where you go! Huh? No, no! It's time to... Do not lay your claws on this lady. I care for her. I truly care for her. Even if she can't stand me. Let me tell you something, though you're a firecracker. I'd do anything for this cupcake. What's more, from this moment on... ...I'm going dry. I will never drink again! Okay, what else have you got? You big flaming chicken! Daniel! Over here! Over here! Help me with these straps! Not me, no! Get out. Go back to your rooms or I'll give you an injection. Can't you hear me? Manu, prepare the syringe! Manu! Hey, what... what are you doing? Stop it, it's not a toy! These are delicate devices, they can be damaged! You might get hurt! I have to go now. No, don't leave me alone. You won't ever be alone. Ana... I'll miss you too, Mom. Goodbye. Leave us alone! No! I can do anything! I can do anything! I can do anything! Stop bothering my mom! Pick on someone your own size! I'm imaginary too and I'm not afraid of you! Come after me, monster! Come on! That way! Now! No! The monster... Is it there? It disappeared. You did it, Ana. And Ana? We'll remember her to the e-end of time. She taught me what true love looks like. And I never got to thank her! Thanks, Ana... ...thanks for everything. Run, Mom, run! Ana! Run, don't stop! Wait for me! Ana! I'm going to beat you! I win! Now you asked for it! No, no! The three of us together, Mom, finally. What's that? Don't worry about me, I'm all right. Ana? I love you, Mom, I love you! Ana? Ricardo... Ricardo! I was dreaming of Ana. Not again! Daniel! Daniel! Are you all right? I'm fine, how about you? You know we don't like you coming up here alone. How does it look? Ricardo! Daniel! Come down to breakfast! Coming! Ana? I love you too, Ana. Hello, Crash! How do you get into people's dreams? I try but I just can't. What are you doing here? The bride and groom are waiting! Rosie said Ana couldn't miss her wedding. Hi Ana, long time no see! -Hello! -Wh-where did you come from now? Where else? Her mother's head, like always. Shall we? -Let's go. -Le-let's go then! So, when do we finish my room? -With your help, maybe today. -Really? And if we finish it, can I sleep there? Sure you can, Daniel. Can Crash sleep there too? No, Crash has his doghouse, here in the backyard. -What if he gets bored? -You'll come and play with him. -Can't he stay inside? -No. What if it rains and he gets wet? -More orange juice? -Yes, please.
