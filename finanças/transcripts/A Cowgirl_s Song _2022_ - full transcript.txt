My parents named me after Halley's Comet. And I've always been fascinated by my interstellar namesake. It burns its way across the solar system visiting Earth every 76 years. Steady and true, like clockwork over a billion years. Now, I'm no scientist, but I know that comet is a freak of nature. I sometimes wonder if life is like my comet, unbending and predestined in following one course no matter what I might do, or is life flexible? Can we alter it? Change it? I don't know the answer, but one thing was for sure, my life was about to be thrown off its course. This is unbelievable. But what are the charges? Transporting stolen goods across state lines? You were just helping Bill out. Well, they used you, Dean. I told you to stay away from those guys. Well, where are they keeping you? Dean, that is 40 miles away. I can't just drop everything. I have a shift tonight. I love you too, but sometimes you make it really difficult. Okay. Can we go and see him? I have shifts all weekend. Maybe Monday. - Monday? - He needs us now. Look, he's gonna be fine. Okay, I'm sorry I know this is really hard on you girls but he is fine. I have to go to work. I love you. Take care of each other. What are you doing? I can't wait till Monday to see dad. Hailey, we... we don't have a car. Who says we need a car? Hailey? A wagon? Horse and wagon. You're kidding, right? Look, we'll take the backroads which I know very well. We'll be there in a day, tops. - I don't know, Hailey. - Okay, look.

Would you look at the stars? You're obsessed with your phone. I am not. I miss grandpa. We all do. I didn't even want to go to practice that day. When we were driving I almost asked him to turn around. If only I had, he'd still be here. Grandpa wouldn't want you to beat yourself up, now would he? No. So shut up and go sleep. I love you. I love you, too. Don't move. I won't. Quiet. Snake! Watch out! Howdy. You guys okay? Yeah. Uh, thank you. I hate snakes. What are you girls doing out here? We can ask you the same question. Uh, I spotted the smoke from your fire. I just... I wanted to come check it out. You can't be too casual about a fire out here. We're on our way to see our daddy at the Grady County Jail. What's he in there for? Some crime he didn't commit. I know someone at the jail. I can take you there if you like. How do we know we can trust you? You seem pretty lost and, uh, I might be your best bet. Always good to know someone on the inside. - All right. - Great. Hey, pack up your stuff. Let's get our stuff. Hey, Son. Come on in. - Hi, Dad. - Hey. Uh, who's this? Dad, this is Brooke and Hailey. - Hi. - Their father's here in jail. - Oh, son. Now, I told you... - Sir... we just want to see our daddy. That's all. Well, next time y'all need to go through the official channels. Uh, yes, Sir. - What's your father's name? - Uh, Dean Mays. Uh, I'm not too familiar with his case, but from what I can see, bail has been set at $50,000. That's a lot of money, Sir. Yes, it is. Well, let's get you in for that visit. Step in to my right. Daddy! - Hi. I miss you. - I'm so happy to see you. Yeah, how are you? I'm okay. I'm good. I'm good. I'm fine. - Okay. - Well, what happened? Uh, I was friends with some really bad people and, um, they took advantage of me. But I want you to know, I'm not guilty of anything that they've said I've done. - We believe you, daddy. - Yeah. Thank you. What... what are y'all doing here? How did you get here? Oh, it's a... It's kind of a long story, but we just couldn't stay away. We wanted to let you know how much we support you. - I love you two so much. - You, we too. Thank you. It means the world to me. I'm sure we'll find a way to get him out soon. We will. It was nice to see him. It was. - All right. - Where y'all headed? Oh, um, our grandmother lives about five miles from here. So we're gonna go visit her and see if she knows anything about our daddy's case. Well, you have my number if you need anything. I do, and as soon as my phone's charged, I'll text you. Thank you, for all your help. We really appreciate it. - Yeah. - It wasn't any trouble at all. Where have you two been? Your mama's been worried sick. Hi, grandma. Some rig you got here. - It was Hailey's idea. - Yeah. We texted mom before our phones died. Texted her? You should have called her. Swear, I'm witnessing the death of communication. We just came from seeing daddy. They said it'll cost $50,000 to get him out of jail. I know. Do you have that much money, grandma? Well, darlin', I don't but we'll figure something out. Here comes your mama. I don't imagine she's going to be too happy with you two. - Three, oh! - Oh! - Hi, Mom. - Hi, Mom. You cannot just ride cross-country whenever you feel like it. Look, we're sorry, but we got to see dad. Hey, Candace! Hm. Erin. Can you believe your son? Last time I heard you're innocent until proven guilty. Well, I don't have the money to bail him out and you haven't worked in years. I'm literally going to have to pick up extra shifts just to make ends meet while Dean's incarcerated. Well, I could help you out. Why don't you just leave the girls with me? I'll look after 'em and its summer, so there's no school? - Can we, Mom? - We can text you every day. I should be punishing you, not rewarding you. Does that mean, yes? Fine. But you better behave yourselves. Erin, if they get into any trouble you better call me immediately. Oh, well, I'm sure they're gonna be perfect little angels. Get over here. I'm worried sick about you. Don't ever do that again. All right. Why do we have to go here? I volunteer here a few days a week. Volunteer? Didn't you used to be a country music star? Yep, and now, I'm a star volunteer. Come on. We're gonna be right with you. - Oh, it's so nice to see you. - Thank you. - Hey, everybody. - Hi. - Good morning, Erin. - Hello, Miss Mays. My daughters are one of your biggest fans. - Can I get a selfie? - Oh, why, sure. - Thank you so much. - Okay. Let's go. - Perfect. Thank you. - You're welcome. Hello. It's so good to see you, Miss Mays. We really appreciate you helping us out today. Oh, it's my pleasure. - What are we serving today? - Well, hot chicken tenders, yeah. Yep. - Ooh! - Homemade mashed potatoes. Here you go. Good old green beans. Looks good. And it looks like we're in business. - How are you today? - Good. There you go. How's your son? Is he good? Is he doing well? Good. And you young, man, would you like some chicken? - Yes, please. - All right. All right. - How'd that volleyball team do? - They won. Well, yeah? Oh, good.

Okay, I am but I'm also seriously developing my career in music management. I just heard you sing and I think you have talent. I've never heard that song. Did you write it? Yeah. It's good. So let me ask you this. Are you interested in becoming a successful singer-songwriter? It's my passion. Good. Then I'd like to represent you. How old are you? I'm 19. I look young for my age. I don't think so. - I can get you gigs. - No, thanks. - I like that store. - Yeah. You should go in there soon. Hailey! - Hailey! - Oh, no! Who's that? It's this guy from Community Center. - He's weird. - Yeah. Hey, it's Rufus, you remember? Yeah, I do. How are you? I'm good and you should be good, too. - I got you a gig. - You already got me a gig? Yeah, I told you I was connected. Caps Brewery, tomorrow at six. Okay, if I come, I'm bringing my sister and a friend. Sweet. I'll see you there. All right. A star is born. Okay. All right. Thank you, guys, so much. It's so good to see you guys again. Give me one second. Hailey! It's so good to see you. Yeah, that's... that's unnecessary. All right. This is my friend Marcos. - Hey. - Howdy. - And my sister, Brooke. - Hi. Hey, Brooke. All right. Well, you two go find a seat in the audience because me and Hailey need to go over some business backstage. - Thank you so much. All right, come on, Hailey. - Okay. All right. This is the owner, Mr. Capp. This is the singer I told you about, Hailey Mays. Well, I'm glad to have you join us here, Hailey. This guy's been talking me up like nobody's business. Really looking forward to hearing you sing. - Yes, Sir. - Excuse me. Oh, and this is Maddie Evans. - Howdy. - Hi, I'm Hailey. Maddie's a gifted singer-songwriter herself. - He's delusional. - Hey, Rufus. Can I talk to you for a sec? I'll be right back. - Does he represent you? - He wishes. Singing and songwriting are really just hobbies for me, but if you ever get stuck and need a catchy rhyme, you can call me. - I will. - Hailey! Hailey! - I'll see you later. - Okay. See ya. So, listen, I was looking at your social media, right? And you have 250 followers. That's... that's pathetic. - It's 258 actually. - It doesn't matter. You still need one million, two million to make it big. Okay. All right. Let's step in here for a second. You can take a seat... but before we get started, I do need you to sign this. - What is it? - An agreement. It says I'll be representing you. Oh, I'd rather have my grandma look at it first. Well, it's mostly there to protect you. You know, if you make a ton of money, how much I get and stuff like that. How much do you get if I make a ton of money? It's the industry standard 20 percent, which is really not that much. You can trust me, I'm sure your grandma would agree. - So if you can initial the first page... - Okay. ...and sign the last one... and initial there. Congrats, you're on your way! Thanks, I think. Oh, you're on in five minutes, so tune up your guitar, get your voice ready. Are you excited? I'm excited. - Yeah, yeah. - Hailey Mays is in the building. Yeah, she is. Hey, folks. Okay. Uh, now, we got a wonderful new singer here named Hailey Mays. And, uh, tonight, Hailey's gonna sing an original composition. So, uh, let's give it up for her. All right. Here we go. Yeah, Hailey! Hey, everybody, I'm Hailey and I will be singing an original song called "A Cowgirl's Song". So hope y'all enjoy. ♪ She saddles up And drives across the plain ♪ ♪ Into a sunset Slowly fades away ♪ ♪ Been seven days Since leaving Chickasha ♪ ♪ She's always moving on From yesterday ♪ You got this, Hailey. - Try again. - Sorry. I can't... I can't. Thank you. Hailey. It's okay. That happens to everyone. No, no, it doesn't. What was that? Get outta here, Rufus! Why didn't you tell me that you have stage fright? That is totally uncool, Hailey. You're not helping at all. Just wait outside. I didn't sign up for amateur hours. You're a jerk. Just ignore him. Every singer gets butterflies. I will never try to perform again. I can't. I promise, you will. How you doing? Okay. Did Brooke tell you what happened? She did. Why do I want to be a singer like you when I can't even sing in front of 20 people? Oh, you could get the hang of it. It just takes practice and experience. Did you ever get stage fright? When I was starting out, I had this performance I was doing and I was so nervous. I... I couldn't make the chords on my guitar. They would not make chord. Oh, dear! But I just kept performing and pretty soon, I never even thought about it. Do you miss performing? Not really. When your grandpa died I... I just didn't feel like it anymore. Must've been hard to give it up. Oh, honey, I had my time to shine. Now I'm doing something else. And it's okay with me. I love you, grandma. - Who raced this barrel? - No one. Well, I used to, but I don't anymore. Why not? It's kinda obvious, isn't it? Well, I don't know about that. You'd be surprised what people can do. Hey. Hi. What's he doing here? He has something he wants to say to you. - No. - Just listen to him, Hailey. Absolutely not. To err is human, but to forgive is cool. All right. The way I acted last night was wrong. You were horrible. Totally... and I sincerely apologize. I'd really like another chance. How do I know you won't do the same thing again? I won't... and I have some ideas that might help you get over your stage fright.

I'll drink to that. - Hailey, Brooke, turn that off. - Oh, no, please. Leave it on. I love that song. - You do? - Yes. I've always loved your music. You know when I was 20, I could sing every song in your Silver Ridge album. - You were always the embodiment of... - ...a classy, strong, good woman. I really shouldn't say you were, you still are today. Thank you. You can leave that on. I haven't heard her laugh like that in a long time. Yeah, me neither. - Thank you. - Hey, Bill. Hey. - Good morning. - Hey, there. What will you have? Hey, I really enjoyed y'alls concert the other night. That was crazy, wasn't it? I was wondering. Uh... I play guitar and I thought maybe we could get together and jam sometime. I don't jam and I don't date which sounds like that's where this is heading. Why not, if you don't mind me asking? Well, because of my condition. No stress, remember? And dating can be very stressful. Okay, well, I just thought it'd be fun. Take a look at that menu. I'll be back in a minute. You wanted orange juice, right? What you two girls did last night was embarrassing and awkward, and ill conceived. And I'm gonna have to give both of you... a high-five. Oh, he is a nice man. I have to say I really enjoyed myself. And I've been thinking. I've decided that I'm going to come out of retirement, just temporarily, and we're gonna raise money for Dean's bail with a concert. I mean that is the one thing I can do. - Right? - I love that. Yes. - Look, I feel better already. - Yeah. All right. Well, let's talk about what we're going to do. Actually, Sir, we're real excited about cutting a record with you... but how would you feel about also doing something with my grandma? And just who is your grandma? The amazing Erin Mays. Erin Mays is your grandmother? And she's coming out of retirement? Yeah. Here she is now. Bob. Good to see you. So you already know each other? Bob was my first manager and if my memory serves me correctly, you still owe me $50 in royalties from my first album. Your check's in the mail. So, Erin, you're planning on unretiring? Just for one performance. I'd like to perform with my granddaughter Hailey. I want to raise some funds for my son's defense. And I thought you could help us with the concert. And then, you could release a single of the live performance. How does that sound? Sounds really good. I'm in. Oh, there's just one little problem. You got to give me my 50 bucks. Come on. All right. - Oh, there you go. - He hates this, you know? What? I'm checking to see if it's counterfeit. Once I was paralyzed, I wanted to figure out how to do everything by myself. Saddle, jump on, everything. - How long ago was your accident? - Four years. - And you haven't ridden since? - No, Ma'am. It's probably time for you to get back on. Now it's your turn. Don't be afraid to use him for balance. Here you go. Let me get your leg. You're going to help her leg? I'm just going to grab you, okay? - Hold that side and then you pull yourself. - One, two, three. - How's that feel? - Weird. Get comfortable. Everything we do now is with our body, our hands, and our voice. Okay. You're ready? - Yeah. - Let's go. There she is. There she is. Well, I haven't played in a while, so... All right.

Well, y'all ready to do this? - Yeah. - Let's hit it. - Let's go. Introducing, the sophisticated lady of country music, the amazing, Erin Mays and her granddaughter, Hailey Mays. Let's give them a big round of applause. We love you! Hey, y'all. Thank you so much for coming tonight. As a lot of you know I haven't performed in a while. - We miss you! - But life goes on and here I am. I am so proud to be singing tonight with my granddaughter, Miss Hailey Mays. Erin! Hey, everyone. Um, some of y'all may know, this concert is to help raise money for my dad who is currently in Grady County Jail. We're hoping to raise enough money to bail him out of jail and find a defense for when his case goes to trial. My grandma wrote a new song and y'all are about to witness the world premiere.

It was nice performing again and... it was extra special because you were there. You know, Erin, I don't lead a very exciting life. So I can't offer you what you may be accustomed to. Well, I'm not looking for exciting. I'm looking for kind, steady and thoughtful... a good person and I sense that's who you are. Thank you. I feel the same about you. Well, good night. Good night, Erin. ♪ You came along You proved me wrong ♪ Wait, look. Wow! Check that out. Oh, would you look at that? Our own little stage. Well, I'm honored. Come here. ♪ How could I forget the Oklahoma stars ♪ So that is the Orionid meteor shower. It's caused by Halley's Comet tail. I thought you were a singer not an astronomer. Well, the only reason I know what it is, is because my parents told me I was conceived the night of the Orionid meteor shower. Halley's Comet won't be back for 40 years, but showers caused by its tail. It's beautiful. Yeah. I think you're beautiful too, Hailey. ♪ So good ♪ ♪ So good It feels like make-believe ♪ - Did you see that one? - I did, yeah. It was cool. ♪ Didn't know what I was missing Didn't know what I was missing ♪ ♪ Didn't know What I was missing ♪ ♪ Till you were standing next To me ♪ After you, Miss Brooke. Hi, I would like to withdraw money from an account. - Okay, sure. Can you please swipe your card? - Yeah. Um, I'm sorry, but it looks like there's no money in this account. There's... there's $50,000 in that account. I see there was but it looks like a withdrawal was made this morning. $50,540. Was it made by Rufus Gibbs? Yes, it looks like he and another young man were here this morning. I'm so sorry. It's okay. Thank you for your help. Rufus, what did you do? Calm down. I can't understand you. Where are you? Okay. Stay right there. What happened? Hailey, I am so sorry. That was the surest bet of my life, but the jockey didn't ride a good race and the horse didn't stand a chance. What are you talking about? We lost it. You went along with this, Marcos? Why didn't you stop him? He said that we could double your money. I... He said that it was a guarantee and that he had an inside tip. I... I thought it sounded like a good idea. Gambling with my father's money sounded like a good idea? How much did y'all lose? This is $1,000. Hailey, I am so sorry. I am so sorry. Just stop crying. You sound pathetic. No, you're both pathetic. Rufus has a lot of problems. But you, you don't have an excuse. You know what? Keep the money. - Come on, Brooke. - Unbelievable. Hailey. Hailey. I'm sorry. This isn't gonna change things, is it? No, it changes everything. Last night... last night, I thought we shared something special and you were this guy that I could imagine myself being with, but today... I see you're just some stupid loser. Come on, Brooke, let's go. What? What are you doing? What does it look like I'm doing? Brooke, you are not ready to ride. - Grandma or Amberley should be here. - I am ready. Just watch me. Giddy-up. - Come on, giddy-up. - This is crazy. What's she doing? I don't know. I tried to stop her. - Come on, Brooke. - You got it. - Brooke! - Brooke! Okay, honey. Where are you hurt? Everywhere. I hurt everywhere, my leg, my heart because grandpa's gone and dad's in jail. And nothing's been the same since the accident. The accident was my fault. Oh, no. It's okay. Your grandpa loved both of you girls so much. And, you know, sometimes things just happen and there's just no rhyme or reason. You know, you could twist yourself all up trying to figure out why... and there ain't no why. But we just got to keep going, right? And we got to remember all of those who are with us. And the last thing grandpa would have wanted was for us to be sad or feel guilty. He'd want us to live our lives to the fullest. Right? So you sing and you barrel race... and fall in love... and make your grandpa proud... ...because he is watching over all of us. Okay? Hey, Maddie, just checking in. Call me back when you get a chance. All right, bye. I wonder where she is? I don't know. Can you believe Rufus just turned 18 today? - He said he was 19. - I thought he was 12. Which means he was 17 last week. Grandma, can you give us a ride somewhere? Mr. Daniels is just pulling up. Come on, we'll take you. Mr. Daniels, can we give the girls a ride? Sure, ladies. Come on. Yeah, yeah. Listen, I need you to meet us at that horse betting place. Can you be there in ten minutes? Rufus. Rufus, just come, okay? Okay, see you there. Hailey, I'm telling you, there's no way to get the money back. Will you at least help me try? Now, I'll do whatever I can. Okay, who did you place your bets with? The guy at the end there, George. All right. Let's go. Um, hi, George. - You know Rufus, right? - Hi, George. Yeah. Hey, Rufus. Are you sure you want to try this again? Well, you see, George, the $50,000 that Rufus lost last week also belonged to me, so we're here to get it back. Yeah, well, that ain't gonna happen. All bets are final. It ain't my problem he lost your money, lady. Well, you see, it actually is your problem because Rufus was a minor when you took all those bets from him and that's illegal. Whoa... hey! - I didn't know he's a minor. - Yes, you did. You were charging 20 percent for the risk that you were taking. Okay, look. So even if I did, and I ain't saying I did... you got no proof he was ever even here. I don't know. I mean, come on. With the face like this, I don't think people around here could forget it. Thanks. And taking a $50,000 bet from a minor sounds pretty bad to me. It was actually a $40,000 bet. He took the 10,000 for himself off top. Well, it's getting worse and worse. Oh, actually, it's a criminal offense with a pretty stiff penalty. You know, all right, all right, all right. I'll give you the lousy ten grand. You can bet on any horse you like. The last race is in ten minutes, so you ain't got a whole lot of time, Sister. Okay. We'll do it. Hailey, are you sure you want to let Rufus bet that money? He doesn't have a very good track record. - No pun intended. - What else can we do? $10,000 isn't gonna help dad. - Just have to pray. - Okay. Looks like there's a lot of praying going on around here. What about For The Win? No, no, no, no, no. For The Win is only two to one. There are three horses that are five to one, your best bet is going to be Silent Speed. The best time last three races, good jockey. - Are you sure? - I'm sure, Hailey. I can feel it in my bones. Normally, I would not condone betting on a horse race. But these are not normal times. Let's do it. And they're off. This is the tenth and last race of the day. Come on, Silent Speed. - Yeah, come on, Silent speed. - Go, Silent Speed. Come on, come on! Get the lightening out, Silent Speed. Come on! Come on, come on. ...and Peter Piper second and third. - For The Win making his move on the inside. - Come on. Come on. Silent Speed faltering and For The Win takes the lead by a nose. - Silent Speed tries to make a move on the outside... - Come on, Silent Speed. ...but Peter Piper maintains lead for third. At the finish, it's For The Win at first place followed by Silent Speed in second and Peter Piper shows for third. Hailey, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I know. We'll figure it out. Ladies and gentlemen, an update from today's final race. For The Win has been disqualified and Silent Speed moves up to first. Peter Piper goes into second... - No way! - Are you kidding me? Yes! Yeah! - Yes! - We did it. We got them! That's amazing. Oh, my goodness! Can y'all believe that? Oh, I almost had a heart attack. You really love money, don't you? - What's not to like about 50K? - All right. Um... Okay. Hey, Maddie, uh, just trying to get a hold of you again. Got some really great news, so I don't know, call me back when you get a chance. All right. Bye. We need to follow that ambulance. Grandma! Mr. Daniels! What happened? We found her unresponsive on her kitchen floor. Are any of you related to Maddie? Uh, we're her close friends. I don't think she has any family. How is she? She's stable, but her lupus is more serious than we thought. I feel we need to move on to the next step which is immunotherapy. Uh, when can you start that? Well, the treatment is very expensive and she doesn't have health insurance. So we can't do it at this time. Um, what will happen to her if you can't do the treatment? Her condition will worsen over time and her episodes will become more severe. I wish I had better news for you. One of you can go see her now. - Go ahead, honey. - Okay. - Hey. - Hey. Hey. I have a flair for the dramatic, don't I? Some people will do anything for attention. - That's me, drama queen. - Mm-hmm. How do you feel? Okay. Doctor says I need some expensive new drug, but I told her... I'm a waitress, so... You're gonna be okay, Maddie. That's nice of you to say that... but I've been dealing with this my whole life and... it was bound to catch up with me one of these days. I don't want you to lose hope. Okay, Maddie. It looks like I need to get some blood. Yippie. And this is where I exit. Extreme needle phobia. - Lightweight. - Um... We'll all be in the waiting room if you need us. Okay. She's resting. Thank you all so much for being here. Of course, we'd be here. Are y'all thinking what I'm thinking? I think we are. Do you mean use this money for Maddie? What about daddy? Oh, honey, he'll understand. And he'll be all right. And I'll just unretire again and we'll raise some more money. Y'all, that's too much to ask of you. It's the right thing to do, Collin. That money right there was meant for Maddie's treatment. You know, Erin, uh, everyone, I didn't want to overstep, but, um, before I retired in my early career, I was a pretty successful attorney. - You were? - Among other things. So I'd be happy to unretire and take your son's case. Pro bono, of course. - What's pro bono? - Means for free. Ah. Wow! Thank you. - Yeah, thank you, Mr. Daniels. - You're welcome. And in order to better serve your son, first thing I'd do is weigh the jury and, uh, request a bench trial. Well, you sound like you know what you're talking about. We gratefully accept. It would be my pleasure. It looks like you got some visitors. Thank you. - Hey, guys. - Hey. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Yeah. Of course. Um, Maddie, we have something important to tell you. We just want you to know that we have all agreed on this. Even Rufus. We've decided to use the money from the fundraiser to help pay for your treatment. No, you guys. - It's what we're gonna do. - Yeah. Oh, thank you so much. Oh, my gosh! - Of course. - Thank you. Yeah. You're gonna be okay. When you agreed to drive the truck for Mr. Robins, did you know the truck was full of TVs? Yes, Sir. I did. And, uh, did you know these TVs were stolen? No, Sir. I thought I was doing a favor for a friend. Even though you knew this friend had a history of criminal activity? Yes, Sir. I... I believe people can change. He assured me that he had. Well, exactly how long have you and Mr. Robins been friends? My whole life. Uh, we went to grammar school together. He got me my first real job. He was a good friend to me. I would ask the defense Exhibit 1 be entered into the record for evidence. It's a copy of an email from Mr. Mays to Mr. Bill Robins from one month before. I need Mr. Mays to read a portion of it. - Response? - No objections. Admitted. Mr. Mays, would you please read the last two lines? "I know times have been rough for you the past few years, Bill, "but I want you to know that I'm here for you "and if there's anything I can help you with, you can call me. "You've always been a good friend of me..." Your Honor, Mr. Mays is a hard-working citizen with no prior records. I do see a breaking and entering. Oh, that was when he was a minor and it was taken off his record. Yes, I see that. He's had the same job for ten years with the same employer. He's also a family man with two lovely daughters, but the prosecution has sucked Mr. Mays into this case as a smokescreen to take the spotlight off Mr. Robins, who is the true guilty party. I, therefore, respectfully request that the court declare a mistrial in its case against Mr. Mays and that he be immediately released. That should be fine. I'll talk to you later. - Hey, Hailey. - Hey. Fingers crossed for a good verdict. I'm sorry. That sounded stupid because you know what I mean. I know what you mean. Hey, you didn't bet on my dad's trial, did you? No, no. Of course not. I... I'm actually trying not to do that anymore. I've been going to these meetings and I'm hoping to put my gambling days behind me. That sounds really good, Rufus. - I'll see you inside. - Sure. - Hey. - Hey. Thank you for coming. You didn't have to. Well, of course. Yeah, I had to. Listen, Marcos, I was pretty hard on you the other day. Hailey, there's... there's no need to apologize. I should have stopped Rufus, but, instead, I went along with him. - I feel terrible. - No, don't feel terrible. I forgive you. And, hey, uh, once this is all over, I thought we could hang out... ...but just as friends. Yeah, I'd like that. Me too. All right. It's time for the verdict. I've taken both of your arguments under careful consideration. It's hard to completely exonerate Mr. Mays, but the State has the burden of proof which it has not met in this case. Therefore, I find Mr. Mays not guilty of transporting contraband across state lines. But I do find you guilty of not using your common sense. Mr. Mays, the next time an ex-con asks you to drive a truck full of valuable cargo across the state line, I hope you think twice. I will, Your Honor. In the meantime, you won't be able to drive for six months because I'm suspending your license and I'm fining you $548 for the original probable cause of speeding. You're free to go, Mr. Mays. Court is adjourned. Yeah! Whoo. Well, one thing's for sure. Life is never boring. And it's not a straight line at all. It twists and turns and usually we never know where it's gonna take us. All right. Up next, we got a good one for you. "Chickasha's own," Hailey Mays singing Cowgirl's Song. ♪ It's a cowgirl's song We sing tonight ♪ Is this you on the radio? I mean, it's the local radio but, yeah, it is. I discovered her by the way. That was me. I'm so proud of you. Yes, the journey is worth the pain and we all have to rise up from the flames at one time or another. But when we do rise, when we overcome adversity and everything works out, it is sweet and gentle and just so cool. Go, Brooke! Whoo-hoo! I look forward to 2061 when I can meet my comet in person.
