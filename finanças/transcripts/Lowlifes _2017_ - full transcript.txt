- Holy bejeezus! You scared the snot right out of me. I told you yesterday, since my wife died, I don't do church no more. Son, you need to go about your business. I told you yesterday I don't need a another bible. Maybe when I'm ready to meet my maker. - Company, left face, march! Left, left, left, right, left. Get in step, boys. Left, left, left right left. Left, left, left, right, left. Bring your arm, boys. Left, left, left, right, left. Company, halt! Left face, march! Forward, march! Company, halt. About face. Parade rest! Team Bomb Squad. - Yes, sir! - Team Lady Snipers. - Yes, sir! - Team Bone Crushers! - Yes, sir! - Young man, what did your mama feed you? - Disaster must be upon us. They called out the National Guard. - Camino. Camino, can I borrow $5? - You already owe me 10. - I do? Damn it. - Excuse me? - Permission to pass, sir? - Permission to pass, sir. - This weekend exercise will be filled with lots of new for you. Trees, lakes, animals, insects. Something waxing your butt there, Theodore? - Just not a big fan of insects, sir. - Well, certainly you have bugs in Chicago. Smell the fresh air. Not like the South Side, is it? - No, sir. - Listen up. Or you will be left behind. Bluestone Academy is for your benefit. A second chance to leave your shitty past behind you. Be a team player. - It's a boot camp for troublemakers. They drill them like in the army. - Thank you, Sergeant. I believe this will be a great experience for you all. - Excuse me? - We're waiting to pass you. - Fall in, now. You're on report there, Theodore. Perhaps he can watch your backside. So I won't be there to wipe it. Is that clear? - Yes, sir! - Fall in. - Cadet Camino. You're on report. So that means no tunes. People, I know you all brought personal devices. If you are on report, you cannot use them. Sorry. - Ooh, Theodore's on report. - You punked my ass. - Language, Camino. - Hey, look at me, I'm a thug. - You're also the only white girl here. - Yeah, I know you're from the hood, Cassandra. - I know you wouldn't last 10 minutes in my hood. - Pshh. - Roxy, want to play? Double or nothing. - Sorry, Mack, I don't gamble. You don't get anywhere in life taking chances like that. - Cass, who's that? - Chombo. - Cass's boyfriend and one mean mother so you better watch yourself, Camino. - I can take care of myself. - Chombo's my brother. He actually just got out. - J.K. Yeah, she's single. You can have your little romance, Teddy. - Dang, watch out, are you trying to kill us? - Freely. Are we close? - God, I hope so. Why are you so calm? - You should see how far these kids have come. - Got change for $5? - Not falling for that, Mack. - Man, you lady snipers are supposed to be ladies. - You ask for money every day but never give it back. - Come on, Mack, just lay off. - Whoa, whoa, I'm just looking for change. I have the five right. - Oh, my God, oh, my gosh. Oh, my God, I can't find my license. - What did these kids do? - I need it. - For what? - Hello? All right, who took it? - Freely beat up a teacher. And Camino had a full scholarship to U.C., hanging with the wrong crowd and got busted driving a getaway car. Mack is from Haiti. He hasn't had an easy life. - What about the girls? - Cass took a car for a joyride, crashed it. Roxy. Roxy had a gun accident. The big guy, he stopped talking after his little brother died in his arms. stealing a candy bar. - Ow. - Guys. A phone? This is B.S., he's on report too. - He has trauma. It's allowed. - Mommy? Yeah, that one with the long hair is giving me trouble again. The ugly A-hole. - Whoa! Hey! Hey! Hey, hey! - Sit down! - Hey, easy, Camino. Sit down! Zero tolerance, Camino. If not, no completion, no G.E.D., no more soccer. Am I clear? - Yo, why didn't you stop them? - Don't concern me. - Deal with that anger, son. Team player, it's required and it's the only way to get through here. Team first. - I'm teamed up. - Name? - Chombo. - Full name? - Perfect? - You bet your ass. - You oughta stick around. Come on, teach marksmanship. - Good luck with the newbies. - Flapjacks tomorrow. - All right. Not even pancakes. Thought you loved helping kids. - Kids. Got a couple of gang-bangers, vandals. Couple of manslaughters thrown in. - And you're handing them loaded weapons on purpose? - A bullet at a time. Hopefully, Sunday I still got all my toes. - See ya. - Is this gonna take all day? - You got all weekend, son. - We're waiting to use one gun? - Staff sergeant is not present but I see no need for decorum to waiver. - Yeah, well it's stupid, sir. - We need to make sure you understand, safety first. - Yeah, I got it. Safety first, sir. But I think we should be able to use. - I didn't say commence. We are not in a hurry, son. Now stand down and wait for my command. - I've been shooting my whole life, sir. - Cadet. Cadet Camino. I said in line, army style. Gotta move that, Ted. - Sir, that's too close to the wild animals. - Get along, you two. Or you'll be sharing a sleeping bag. - Lucky first shot. - Yeah, I told you. - You're not gonna shoot? - Somebody stole my license. - Just look for it later. There are no stores out here anyway. - Hey, I'm going in. - Hey! Let's play, Turd. - Do it. I'm tired of dealing with you. - Kill yourself then. - I will. - That'd save me the trouble. - Don't you say that. I am not. - Jerk. - You'll be sorry. - Hey. I'm talking to you. Hey! Hey! You, what are you doing? I was just trying to help him. - Stay there, Camino. Don't talk to him. - So that's it? No show of remorse? Very disappointing, commander. I drive two hours to learn that these animals can get away with attempted murder?

Just like Freely. Everybody let your hair down. - I'll let my hair down when you give me a straightening iron. - Oh, a bug, it's gonna bite me. Its ass lit up. - We don't have those bugs in Haiti. - What's wrong? - Nothing. - Don't worry, he'll bounce back. - Boy, don't try me. - Okay, campers. Dawn comes early around here. Let's go. - Wait a minute, is that a snake? - Snake! Don't leave me, don't leave me. - You're from the hood and you're scared of snakes? - Let's go, ladies. - Oh, that hurt. - Let's go. Not you two. You build a big fire, you put a fire out. Don't even think about it. - Ow, dude. - Camino! All right, baby. All right, man, pull over. I gotta get something. - What? - This is good, I'll be right back. - Hey, there's not gonna be any alcohol or drugs at this party? - Really? What did you think? - You know, if I get anywhere near that shit, coach will cut me. - Asshole. - Hey, get me an energy drink while you're in there. And don't bring any beer in the car. - Yes, I know, mother. No beer, got it. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go! - What did you guys do? - I got your energy drink. Go, go. - What? Life sucks, why are you here? - I was going home, now I have to drive your ass back. - Because maybe you're a driver. It's your job. - You're a smart-ass lowlife. - Man, you don't know nothing about me. - That's right, walk away. - You just shut up, man, okay? - Never amount to anything if you always walk away. What the hell? - Why don't I come up there and kick your ass? - You know, stow it. There's some idiot in the middle of the road. You broke down? - Who wants 50 pushups? Turn those lights out? - No bars. - Shit, Will. - You got your kiddies tucked in? - My kiddies? Yeah, I think so. - Do you hear that? Automatic weapons fire. - Really? Call it in? - Well, the nuke plant's back that way, gotta run your exercises sometime. - He would have notified you? - Yeah, I got a radio in my office. - Nuclear plant. - Phew! One of us stepped in deer shit. - Oh, yeah, we're in deer country. I have never not talked to my wife for three days. - You want to get away? You go to Alaska, Utah, and here. I can radio her for you. - Yeah, sure you can. - Fricking kids are messing with us? - They wouldn't dare. - Well, who the hell else would screw with a police firing range? - Freely. Freely. - Shauna. - Is Freely in there? - No. - Where is she? She said she'd go pee with me. - I think you can go by yourself. - Will you go with me? - No. Reveille's at five. - Can I borrow your flashlight? Forget it. I can see. Shauna. I think some farmer's driving a tractor. Hey, hey, I don't think he can see us. Tents, fall in, fall in! Everyone get out of the tents! Fall in, fall in! - Shit! Holy shit, shit, shit! Give me the light, give me now. - God, dude, don't go back there. There's some crazy farmer ran over all the tents and Lea's dead, they're all dead! Damen, stop! - Get your big ass back here, dough boy. - Listen, listen, he's just trying to get your attention, okay? Listen, you can hate us all you want, man, but you have to listen right now. Crazy shit is going on over there. - Come on, Freely. - Chicken. - Have you seen goosebumps the size of golf balls? That's what my skin will look like. Big black-ass golf balls. - It's not cold. Yes it is. No, it's not. It's all mental. - You're all mental. Come on, let's go back to camp. - Fine, go for it. - Uh, not by myself. There are snakes, and bugs with their ass lit up and all types of shit, I'm not going back to camp by myself. Are you crazy? We hear you back there. - Mack, have you been watching the whole time? - What? No. Just got here, I didn't see nothing. - Ooh, Mack is so naughty. - Freak, you need to go back to camp. - Told you. - We thought you were dead. - Hey, turn around. - What'd you bring them for? - Hey, shut your trap. Some serious shit has gone down. - You shut your trap, you cracker-ass white-- - Listen to them, listen to them. - Some crazy hick, he ran over all the tents with his tractor and he shot Lea. He shot Lea dead. - It's gross. - You're lying. - We're not that gullible, okay? - Nice nips. - Guys, Puke, zero bullshit. Is it true? - Yes. - Oh, my God, Lea's dead? Shit, she has my makeup bag. - God, Roxy. - Where are you going? - We need to find, we need to find a car and we need to find guns right now. - No, hey, if what you're saying is true, we need cops. - We're in the middle of nowhere. - No, wait, wait, wait. Why would farmers try to kill us? - News flash. In this country, some people are still racist. - Really, Freely? - Uh-huh. - Mack. - Well, nuclear facility. You'd think they'd upgrade the system. Sectors one to three, all clear. - One to three, clear. Cutie in sector four heading south west. - Coyote. - That's what I said. - Lovely accent. - I must go to the water closet. - If you must. Damn. - Gia. Hawking. We're going to yellow. - Why? - Deer season ends today, so foot traffic's gonna be down. - Tracking less people does not necessarily mean less chance of an attack. - Just do your job, Hawking. - Hey, hey! - God, stop it. - Puke, boy, I make your eye black and blue. - Where's your phone? - I lost it with your boyfriend. - I don't have a boyfriend. And I wish he hit you harder. - If we pool our money, I can get us to a police station. - What's the police gonna do? - God, can you be more trusting, Freely? - I don't trust the farmer that killed our team and I sure as hell don't trust him. - A farmer killed our team? Really? - Were you there, Cassandra? Puke face here said a tractor ran them over and you idiots believed him. - Hey, get off the road, dummy. - Where are you guys going? The camp's this way. - Damn it, we need to stick together. - Watch out for the killer farmer. - I think we've walked in a big circle. - Oh, my God. I have the worst migraine ever. - Shh. - I don't know why I followed you. You're really not very nice. - Stop it, Turd. - Dude, I can't see shit. - All right, you know what? I really think we should go back. - Uh-uh, we need some guns. - What if Lea's death was an accident, huh? - An accident? Roxy, you are crazy. - Oops, I accidentally hunted you down and shot you in cold blood. - Shut up. I swear to God-- - Ignore them, ignore them. Ignore them. - Why don't you put me on the ground and make me? - They're probably hunting us right now, Roxy. - Roxy, they don't shut up. Just be the bigger person. We need to go back to the camp because that's the first place Chombo's gonna look. - Chomo is guilty for what? - No, he just has two counts of involuntary manslaughter. - Oh, you hear that? He killed two people involuntarily. - Oops, sorry, I didn't mean it. - Sorry about that, sir. - Did it again. - Accident. - Damn. - Chombo's a bigger man than you will ever be. - Slow down. You're walking too fast. - Look, maybe we should go back. - Let me guess. This don't concern you. - Hey, it's Cass. Leave me a message. - Morning. - Morning. New driver? No, I don't need to see your permit. Protocol says I do need to search the car though. Looks okay to me. - Have a good one. - Thank you, sir. Nuclear plants have the best fishing, don't they? - So many fish, it's sick. - We'll get sick if we eat them? - Enjoy, sirs. - Asshole. - What is that? - You want some more, baby? - Oh, like I'd be interested, dick. - I'm so hungry. - Yogurt in a tube? Give me some of that. - Sorry, Roxy sucked me dry. - You wish, loser. I did not just sleep on this, ground's freaking wet. - Come on, Kim, I didn't knew you like her. - Dude. - Your real name is Kim? Is your mommy coming, Kimmy? Your head down the toilet again, Kimmy? - Shut up. - Kimmy, where are you going? - You're really brave, you know that? - I don't feel brave. Everyone's gone. Lea, Camino. Chombo. - Well, I'm here. - Cass! - Jesus. Where did you come from? - Some crazy dudes come up the bus and they killed the driver. I barely got away, I've been running all night. - Lea's dead. Randall. We went swimming and Puke said that some farmer ran over the tents. - You were swimming with Puke? - We're headed to the camps right now. - No, no, no, we can't go back there. Puke's wrong. The killer shot at me. Not a farmer. - Well, I'm heading to the camps. - Mack, it's a bug, it's on me. Help, there's bugs on me. Get them off! Get them off! - Chill, chill. - Hello? - Hey, Mike, are you busy? - Just fishing with Chase. - A day off, wow! Say, I'm working for the geological survey with the Rockford Study. Do you know Jim Hickenlooper's farm? Does he have two white buildings or is his with grain bins and a red barn? - He's got two white barns just east of the house. - Oh, gotcha. Yeah, I think I see someone down there. - Jim's a big guy. Not one you want to run into in a dark alley. He's all right. He's got to be the biggest redneck I ever met. - Redneck? Okay. - Yo, what we gonna do? Dude, stop eating these people's food. Find a phone? My mama would kill me if she knew I was up in these white folk's houses. I'm going to leave them a note. - Hey, hey. You placed your name on it. - Where I'm from, you don't steal. - There's good people in Haiti, too. But at least they know not to place their name at a crime scene. - Yo, ya'll hear that? - Car patrol? - Correct. 7 a.m. all sectors clear. You can't have food. - Sue me. - Sector eight, guard patrol delta. Five members heading east. - Confirm but I see only four. All other sectors clear. - You are not my burden to carry. If they ask me, I will tell what I saw. - They're watching us right now. You think eating a lousy sandwich is gonna bring in Homeland Security? - I work my buttocks off. If I lose this clearance, I lose this job. Then I lose my visa. - You read Russian books. What do you think they think of that? - It's a fantasy. - Only English is permitted, so don't lecture me. - I lose this job, I come for you. - You're a damn mood, woman. - She is so hot. - Whatever. - Dude, you know you want her. - Watch the board, I'll be right back. - I don't have clearance to be here alone. Hawking, I'm not watching your station. - That your dinner? - Uh-huh. What's an aquifer? - What's an? It's like a cave. Fresh water that supplies our water. There's one below us. It's over a hundred miles wide. Pumps to cool the fuel rods. - I wouldn't want to be swimming by. - Suck you in and squish you. - Where's all the water go after? - A transfer station. Ends up in a mountain somewhere. - In a cave? - Not the same one. Hello. - Okay, Mike. I'm over that firing range you mentioned. - Roger. - It looks abandoned. - There should be two dozen people. - Well, there's an awful lot of foliage, and hold on. Oh, my gosh. Their stuff's scattered everywhere. And wait. I see a group of five. And there's a blonde haired female. - One of the boot camp kids? - I'm not sure. They're all walking away from the range. They're wearing the same color pants. - The kids wear uniforms, too. - Sure, but, why would they leave their camps all trashed? - Hey, I gotta run. - Oh, okay, Mike. Sorry to be such a bother. - That sounded like a helicopter. Maybe they're looking for us. Have you gone yet? Dude, it's not healthy for you to hold it in. Just go. - You're not my fricking mom. - I think we should split up. - Why would you say that? - Say what? - You just found us. - Yeah, well, I saw them messing around. Think I should go check it out. - You just said we should look for help. - This area's under attack. It would be helpful to know why. Puke can take care of you. - Puke? You're so complicated. - Oh, great. Hey, buddy boy. You driving a tractor last night? - Buddy your ass. - Yeah, you'd like to buddy my ass, wouldn't you? - Are you jealous of him? - Jesus, it sucks out here. Camino, why are you here? F.Y.I. Cass, I went. - You know, I don't know why I came back, okay? - Roxy, not now. - Here's one for later. - Wait, guys, guys, guys! Get off of him! Guys! - Oh, Cass, I'm sorry. - I'm fine! - Fricking bugs! Oh, hi, I'm sorry. I'm just lost. - What are you doing? Get off of me. - What happened? - Give it to me. - Hey. - I'm an expert marksman, okay? - You're an expert chicken shit. - I saved your life. - I out-rank you. Give me the gun. - Cadre of the Lady Snipers don't mean shit out here, okay? You don't even know how to load the damn thing. I'm an expert. - Put it down, boy. - Oh, shit. - Yo, we don't want no problems. - What the hell? - You guys are scaring the fricking deer. - Yeah, well you don't own the woods. - Turd, shut up. - Own the woods? Ha! You're right, Turd. - Code four, Bubba. We're going hunting for real terrorists. - Code four? No shit. - Those sons of bitches ran over your friends? - And captured one of us. - So this is all that's left of you? - Doris, you got your ears on? Aunt Doris, we got terrorist activity somewhere near 6,000 north, 350 east, copy? - Just call her. - Dead zone. Not a cell tower for 50 miles. - Mack, follow her. - Lunch break. - What are you monitoring? - Citizens band. It was nothing. - Lunch break. - Not tonight, Nelson. - Hey, I watched your station for you. It's time for my favorite show. Yoga with the Stars. - Colby, fight from the south. - Just me? - Hey, man, don't question. He was in Nam. - Hey, no eating. - Now, that is the shit, man. Ooh, I am moving to fricking Russia. - She's from the Republic of Georgia, you idiot. - My aunt lives in Atlanta. Don't look nothing like that. - They comeback to something here. - Wait, I can see Roxy. I can just look. - No, no, no, no. Look, are you sure? No, no. I have fought outlaws. - What do you want from us? Nobody even knows you're out here, okay? You're the real deal. - What the hell is that? - What'd they say? - Nothing, not a sound. I can't do another night. - Is that the power plant? - Can I see it? - I think so. - What's it like to kill someone? I bet he deserved it. - Cass! - So I have to be very careful when I clean this panel? - Yeah, you bet your ass. No abrasive, and no water, all right? - You guys, so full of shit. - Are we under attack? - No one's home. What's wrong with your car? - I don't know, I just freaked. - Man, what are you doing? - Well, you said no one was home. - Yeah, but what if they come back? - All right, well, we should be quiet. So these terrorists. These guys, you don't know what they want? - Didn't have time to ask. - Covered faces? Maybe terrorists that don't wanna take credit, huh? - Hey, we could cross the field on that. Can you hot wire it? - Can you drive it? - Hey, you got anything? - Uh, try now. - All right. - Need to work on your quiet. - Somebody get me a pot of coffee, it's gonna be a long night. Where did that E.M.P. deploy? I need a location, people. - Working on it, working on it. - Gia, call it in. - Full alert, code red. Backup power is 80%. - So the E.M. fried most of the system. God. - Air National Guard reporting. Explosion, sector 15. They blew up the whole farm. I'm gonna call state police. - Chombo. Yeah, I'm okay. - Are you okay, princess? - I want to thank you. I wouldn't have found Cass without you, son. But if I were him, you'd be dead. - Chombo, he's not worth it. - Come on. Drop that, the plant is under attack. - What is that? - Mack, Mack! Come on, come on! Come on, come on, come on. - Camino, I owe you this. - Wait, you don't owe me nothing, okay? - I'm sorry. If anybody. - Mack, Mack! - I.D. these for me. - Green is for friendlies. Red is unknown. - The unknowns are probably an anom, amun-- - Anomalies. The signals have been increased since the E.M.P. - Do we look stupid, Hawking? Who the hell are the red? - I'm an American doing my job. - Tell the patrol. I don't want them shooting Bambi and his mother, let alone a hunter. - Well, you can forget that. We should be careful. - Colonel Jackson. - I need all of your activities transferred to my staff within the next 3 1/2 minutes. - Who are they? - Homeland Security, I think. - What activities? For the week, the month? - Why is he speaking directly to me? I will be in your office. Custodians do not have access during code red. Arrest him. - What's a code red? - You think you can come to our country and kill without payback? - You did. - You saw them coming, didn't you, huh? - No, I didn't. I was just as surprised as you. - Did you kill Mack? - No. - Why are you here? - Roxy said they don't talk. - The last one. - Kill him, kill him! - Cass said you're not a murderer, man. - What the hell? She's like hot. - So? Bitch has one thing on her mind and that's murdering us. - Chombo. - Cassandra. - Hey, just chill for a sec. - You ain't going though, bitch. - Thanks for doing that. - Look, I'm not dragging her ass. - One of us can stay. - I will. - No, I will. - Three video feeds are unaccounted for. - What? - Cameras have diverted our Homeland feed. - Been busy, Hawking? - Me? You disrespect me every day. Now with these clowns, I'm not just gonna sit here and let you guys-- - Yes you are, yes you are, yes you are. - All right, that's the regular patrol. Our feed ended here. - Those friendlies? - Well, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care. I need a two-mile buffer zone. Get me incident management. - Look, this is the last day of hunting season. Nobody pays attention to posted signs. - Well, it is possible that no one intentionally diverted these videos. Here's the last one here. I can take them an analyze them in greater detail. - Why don't you analyze them in greater detail now? - Roxy! - Life or death reflex. - We have three layers of buffer. There's little chance that we'll be breached. - This is pissing me off. Check the generator. Run down there. - Control to unified command. We are standing by for a possible third E.M.P. strike within our buffer zone. - So, you just gonna drive up there? - Wait, why don't we just get closer so we can see? - How we all going to fit in there? I'll just wait there. - I hate this, but I agree with the big man. I'm sticking around, too. - Are you serious? So we're all just going to wait here? - So I'm thinking, this doesn't concern all of us. Why don't we just stay here and wait for another car to drive by? - Chombo! - Hello? Hello? Hello? - This is the conservation police. Who is this? - We're in some serious danger. Okay, I think there might be, to the nearest water. - Water what? You're breaking up. - Call the army. Forgotten any, yeah. - Backup power stable. We have a possible threat in sector. - Eight, unauthorized vehicle approaching. - Attack the gate in broad daylight? - Sir, this is a secure area! Step out of the vehicle! - What? - Sir, you must follow my explicit instructions or you will be fired upon. - I'm not the bad guy. - Sir! - Hey, I'm an American! - Sarge, I think I shot him in the arm! Sir, lay down the weapon face first! - Gunfire exchanged at the northwest fence. - Vehicle disabled. - We need I-sap. - Gia, I'd like to speak to you. - Have a nice flight. - Is there anything? - No further activity. Oh, might be something on this one. - Millions in detection gear and you guys can't find a lump in your shorts. - Guys, what happened? - Your plan A, Chombo, dead. Plan B, Cass got in a truck with the terrorists. - Send your girlfriend to the grave. Nice job. - Very mature. What next, Camino? - We gotta get to water. - Uh-uh, no more water. - Commander Randall said, before we got here, many people get their water from some big underground lake. I saw toxic waste signs. They're planning on poisoning the water. - That's stupid. They're going to blow up a nuke plant. - According to the guard, who fired on him is a group of teens. They also were seen in another location of ours. - The troublemakers from Chicago. - All right, what's happening? - No further attacks, sir. - Where was that taken? - The transfer station showed this image hours ago and since the last E.M.P. strike, can't reach anybody. - Anything light? - No, no alarms. - Run a diagnostic. If it's the E.M.P. Nothing's working right. - You people, you keep spinning your little wheels. And you're wasting my time. Do I have to do everything myself? Send a patrol to the way station, make sure nothing has been breached. Gia, get the transport chief out of bed. I want him to count every drum, every pallet, make sure nothing is missing. - Nuclear waste is stored there? - It's a transfer station for water that's come in contact with the fuel rod. - Even kids know a single drop of plutonium could poison an entire lake. - What are civilians doing here during a code red? - Mike Tolrey's conservation police. He knows the area and he may know the kid in the video. - Kid? A kid set off an E.M.P.? - I saw a group of kids and the kidnap video was at a camp. - Camp? - Could it be a diversion? If they stole the waste, they could poison the water. - The Erie aquifer's a hundred square miles across. - Please, go give some fishermen a fine and get out of my formerly secure office. - Come on. - Now, the rest of you, nobody else leaves until I get some answers. - If I had a .50 cal with hollow points? - Ain't no video game. - I gotta see if Cass is in there. - Camino, be careful. - Come on, let's go. - What if they come back? - What now? - I have been put on suspension. - Well, that takes the shit. - What takes what shit? - They think you have something to do with this. - I-sat, live. Finally really, I can finally use a satellite the way it was intended. Sweet Jesus. - A satellite is feeding back our location. As commanded, your highness. - Would you switch to the water treatment plant, please? There. - There? There? - There. - There. Oh, I have made it so, number one. - Shut up, Hawking. Shouldn't we check out the water station Mike mentioned? - So. Pouring nuclear waste into an underground aquifer. That really is what all of this is about. - I don't think you should ignore it. You'd be kissing the middle U.S. states goodbye. - Oh, don't forget to kiss the Mississippi and the Gulf of Mexico. - You're relieved. - Am I? Now that is a relief. God, it took you idiots so long. So how does it feel that the entire middle U.S. will be uninhabitable for 10,000 years and you can't stop it? Welcome to your apocalypse, gentlemen! - Arrest him. - Call the Pentagon. - You? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I killed. And I'm going to keep you around for a little bit now, baby cakes. Give me some of that fine piece of ass before I go. - What will become of me? - Show me a great time, then. - Where should I put this? - Be creative. - Control. We have been breached. Everybody is down. I repeat, security room is breached. - Watch the hair. - Camino! - Oh, shit! - Hey, over here! - Freely. Freely. Freely, shh. You're fine, you're fine. Come on, come on. Freely, come on. Give me your hand. - Hey! - Camino! - Bitch! - Hey! - To the right. There's something going on it. Oh, God. Oh, my God. There's a combine on fire. It ran into that building. There's a bunch of guys in hazmat suits. And they're pouring something out of barrels right into the aquifer intake. - I'll call it in. - She's been shot. Put pressure on it. Pressure on it. Hey, don't leave me again. - You know I never meant to hurt you. - Just don't do it again, okay? - Oh, I think I see those kids again. Can you get us a little closer? What the hell is coming behind us? Jeez! Oh, my God. Can you get in the maze? Right there! Mayday, mayday! - Damen, Damen! - This concerns me. - Put some pressure it, pressure on it. - Drop your gun! Hands in the air! - It's okay. I'm sorry. - Last face I'll ever see. Oh, my God. - Damen, we need to get Freely to the hospital. Damen, are you hurt? - Kid, get the hell out of there! Stop or I will shoot! Get on the ground! - Chombo? - Get on the ground, now! - This is bullshit. - This is bullshit, we're Americans. - Chombo, they know. They're just doing their job. - Is that one of the troublemakers? - Actually, that's what a hero looks like, son.
