[Paul Watson] The ocean produces oxygen. The ocean regulates temperature, climate control. The ocean provides food. All of these things that are essential for our survival. [Sid Chakravarty] Take a breath. Now take another breath. And that second breath comes from the oceans and that's how people's lives are impacted. You have to have an interest in their survival. [Paul] What we're seeing in the ocean is a steady decline of biodiversity in the sea. The destruction of the fishes. [Alistair McDonnell] There are studies which estimate the global illegal catch of fish is between 12 and 23 billion. So there is definitely an organized crime business model. They are forging government documents, making false customs declarations that engaged in corruption of officials. What we're looking at is murder of the ocean and if the ocean dies, we die. [Adam Meyerson] I just don't see how we can go straight through that. - How we're just going to take a pounding. - Simple misery. [Adam] It's an area of the world that there's very little break in the ocean. The low-pressure systems just travel one after the other after the other. It's a notoriously rough part of the world. [Peter Hammarstedt] For the past ten years, Sea Shepherd has been defending whales in the Southern Ocean. This year, we're defending Patagonian and Antarctic toothfish. The fact that these fish live in the most remote waters in the world makes these poachers feel like they can get away with anything. Working with Sea Shepherd, I've had to make a lot of sacrifices. The biggest thing I miss is my family. It's been 12 years since I've spent the holidays with them, but this is where I have to be. Cooking when the ship is rolling is pretty wild. It is definitely quite a bit harder than normal. [man] This is my first Antarctic campaign. I was the skipper of a game fishing charter boat. I got sick of killing fish for tourists, so I came and joined Sea Shepherd. [Krystal] I avoid the cold like the plague so what am I doing going to Antarctica? Well... trying to save the ocean. - Morning, everyone. - [all] Morning. Welcome to the shadowlands. We are now in the most remote fishing grounds in the world. We're defending Patagonian and Antarctic toothfish. These are vulnerable fish populations that are being targeted by six illegal operators. These aren't poachers backed by governments like with the Japanese whaling fleet, these are criminal operations that earn millions. It's possible that they're armed, and I have no doubt that they'll be willing to use violence to stop us from intervening. The Thunder and the Viking are two vessels that Interpol put out Purple Alerts for. Our mission is to find these bandits, shut down their illegal fishing activities, confiscate and destroy any illegal fishing gear that we find and to measure our success by the number of criminal operations that we shut down. Okay? Thank you. Let's bag a poacher. [radar blipping] There's been quite nasty weather to the north of us for about a week now. The area we're in now has had good weather. This is a place where the poachers have been found before so it's very likely that they've set up camp here. It looks like something's on the radar. Yeah, Jeremy, I've got a radar target about nine miles. It looks like about 11 o'clock. See if you can see anything over that way. [Adam] Roger that. [radar blipping] [radar beeps] Oh, look at that. - That's a ship. - [Adam] Yeah. All right, they just slowed down. It's turning around the other direction. - It looks like they're just running, huh? - [Peter] Yeah. - [Adam] All right. - [Peter] We've got ourselves a fishing boat. - [Adam] Looking good, huh? - [Peter] It's looking very, very good. [Adam] Definitely a fishing boat. [Peter] Stand by. Once we've got a visual ID on it, we'll go to action stations. [McDonnell] Thunder is one of the group of vessels who've been involved in unregulated fishing in the Southern Ocean for some time. Six boats, two trips a year, $5 million a trip. It's been at it ten years. We can do the math. This has been an iconic crime gang. To them, fish is basically money swimming around in the sea. Interpol is a law enforcement organization, and whilst we support sustainability and good management, law is the keyword. There are still significant gaps in enforcement. We cannot chase around the oceans after every single pirate vessel out there. It's a huge amount of effort. There's a lot of crime out there because nobody was looking. Now we are looking. Fishing vessel Young Being, I order you to leave these waters immediately. [McDonnell] These boats are fishing where there is no surveillance. This is how the criminals get away with it. So we're encouraging the NGOs at sea to use whatever they can to go after illegal fishing. [shutter clicking] That really looks like the Thunder. Yeah, that's the Thunder. We got the Thunder. [laughing] [Peter] The Thunder is the kingpin of the toothfish poachers. This is a vessel that has evaded justice for ten years. Well, we definitely interrupted them as they were fishing. [ringing] Get Sid on the phone. [Sid] There's a bit of nervousness when we set out on these campaigns. There's something really unique about Antarctica. Knowing illegal vessels are operating in this pristine place on this planet... Sam Simon, this is Sid. Hey, Sid. So I have in front of me the Thunder. - You do? - Yep, we've got a visualize ID on the vessel. They're leaving their fishing gear behind. They're now running so now we're just gonna get in behind them, then we're gonna radio them and place them under arrest. All right, that's great, Peter. I'm gonna try and cover this ground to get to that fishing gear. Okay. Thanks, Sid. So, he's got the Thunder. [cheering] We'll get a distance on how far we have to go, but I guess that'll be our first mission, to haul in that gear. That's cool. [Peter] Thunder, this is Bob Barker. Bob Barker. You are fishing illegally. That's very lucky because we speak Spanish as well. Say. "Thunder, you are fishing illegally. Do you have a fishing license number?" [speaking Spanish] Tell them that there is an Interpol Purple Notice for them. We're a conservation law enforcement. We're placing them under arrest and they're to come with us to Fremantle, Australia. [speaking Spanish] [Peter] Sea Shepherd has a global reputation of shutting down poaching and it's a reputation that's known best by the poachers that we target. When Sea Shepherd shows up, poachers don't continue fishing illegally, they flee. [man speaking] [Adam] We might be heading into some pack ice. They may try and see if they can go through the ice faster than we can. [Peter] It's clear that the Thunder wants to try to lose us in ice. It wants us to intimidate us and force us to break away from pursuit. I could just see us both getting stuck pretty easily. [Adam] The one danger you always do worry about in the ice is getting beset. The pack ice closes in behind the vessel pretty rapidly. You certainly can't back up because your propeller and rudder, the most vulnerable parts of the ship, are on the stern. It's hard to steer at this speed. We just have to keep bouncing off these like a pinball machine. [Adam] You can hear the ice grinding down the side of the ship. [metal grinding] It's just a sound that gets right into your stomach. This ice may look pretty harmless, it's actually as solid as a rock. [man on comms] Yeah, that's not gonna happen. We gotta push through this. Ships have hit ice here. Ships have disappeared here with all their crew, and we're a long way from rescue. [Peter] I'll leave you the bridge then. Thank you. [Paola] Good night. They're slowing down again? Yeah, they're down to 6.9. [Paola] I'll go 60. [beeping] [Paola] Go on. Portside, you didn't hit it. [Stefan] I'm going on course. [man speaking] [Paola] You lost the steering? And autopilot doesn't respond? [Paola speaking] [beeping continues] [engine stops] It's on two, huh? It's not on one. [Stefan speaking] [Sid] So it's Christmas morning. I miss my family. But all of us agree that being here is important. Nine days ago. Over the last ten years, the Thunder's owners have made over $60 million in illegal profits. They've been operating with impunity outside the full reach of the law. Confiscating that gear can build a strong case to help prosecute the Thunder and shut it down. Who is it? Who is it? - [man] Oh, yes! - [man 2] Yeah, that's nice! [Sid] These illegal vessels use a very destructive form of fishing called gillnets, which run for kilometers and sit at the bottom of the ocean. Toothfish are the controllers of the marine ecosystem. Their survival is very important to Antarctica. Not only are they catching the toothfish, they're also catching everything. We need to pull in this fishing gear. We've been viewing across a boat due west. [man] Should have it. All right. Let's pull it in. [Sid] This line has been in the water longer than it should be. So it's weighed down by a lot of life that's coming up from 1,500 to 2,000 meters. It's just putting a lot of strain on the line. - Whoa. Whoa! - [man] Whoa! Some more turns will be needed. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. There it goes. Gone. [bleep] [Sid speaking] So that's all clear water, is it? [Adam] Yeah, I think if you just go right through this, you're out. They're picking up speed, are they? We need a bit more speed here, end to end. - [man] Copy that. - We need to go out to starboard right there. [Peter] By this point, they're basically running for home. - What speed are they doing now, Adam? - 7.7. [woman] You're just clearing this last bit now. [man speaking on comms] [exhales] And we'll just come up on them at 8 knots. [speaking Spanish] He's not the owner of the ship. It doesn't depend on him. He's just obeying orders and the same way we're obeying orders from Paul Watson. [Paul] You have absolute authority. I don't micromanage our captains at sea. So the decision is yours, whatever you wish to take. Well, we certainly found them in record time, and it really shows you just how easy it is to track them and find them. Australia could've done it, New Zealand could've done it, yet they don't do it. They're simply not upholding the law. If they were doing their job, we wouldn't have to do it. You know, he's really not in command. You know, he takes orders from a criminal, it's a criminal operation, so you certainly have much more authority than he does and you're in the right, he's in the wrong. It's as simple as that. Do you think they're gonna turn west? [Adam] I think they already have a couple degrees. [Peter] The seas are picking up to almost 8 meters. Wind's blowing at 40 knots. It's not a comfortable place to be, but it's the place that the Thunder decided to take us. Oh, this is a big one. [loud thud] They could do damage to our small boats. - Let's suit up with Alistair. - Okay. Bridge, go ahead. [Peter] Okay, as soon as you get to the fore, facing a bit of our superstructure, so you need to clip in right away. In this weather, it's very dangerous to go out on deck. Certainly, the biggest risk to any crew member would be going overboard, in which case, it would be very, very difficult to recover them. Alistair, get Shamus to harness in, please. There's a big one, hold on. [man] That is cold. [man 2] One, two, three. Push in. Yep. You're happy with everything secure? Okay, get back inside. Excellent job. Thank you. This poacher's been trying to do everything to lose us. They've taken us through ice conditions, they took us to some of the worst weather that the Southern Ocean can throw at us, and we just kept on their tail. I don't know what the Thunder's going to do now, but we'll continue fighting on for as long as it takes until these guys are finally in cuffs. Remember the damage that these nets cause. These lead lines go down about 2 kilometers because Patagonian and Antarctic toothfish are very, very deep down in the water. These curtains of death are notorious for just killing species until they get pulled out of the water. And it's because we're with the Thunder, they're not able to pull their gillnets out. The question that I've been getting from law enforcements on land is what kind of evidence do we have that the Thunder was fishing. Yes, we saw them 5 miles away from fishing buoys. Yes, we saw them ready to deploy gear. Yes, we saw gear on deck. But being able to provide this physical evidence helps close the case. The Sam Simon has been outfitted with equipment that is made to pull up these nets. [Sid] The line heading down to the nets has snapped. [man] It's all gone. [bleep] I guess just too much tension. Fortunately, gillnets are set with two sets of buoys. I'm hoping that we can find the set of buoys at the other end. These nets run up to 130 kilometers long. Just to put them into reference, the Sam Simon sails about 130 kilometers in one day. We'll go around this iceberg, and then head to where they spotted the Thunder. And then we'll head due west. We're looking for a needle in a haystack. We have to all think of ourselves as being one of the only 30 people on this planet who have the responsibility to go out there and pull that bloody net out of that water. That little thing there. I can see something right ahead. Is it an iceberg? [Krystal] It's gonna be the buoys from the Thunder. -Bridge, raise the deck. We've have the buoys. -[Sid] We got them! Yeah, I see it. Right there. String of buoys bang ahead. Yes! Whoo! - Unbelievable! - [Sid] Oh, my God. Oh. So good. Hey, Peter, Sid here. Just calling you with some good news. We're started our search pattern and have come across another set of buoys. - Well done. - You reckon this is the other end of the set that had the line snap a couple of hours ago? The boat's about to go in and we'll be able to begin operations right away. Okay, that sounds like a plan. [tense music playing] This is kind of our last shot. I'm gonna jump up and make sure everything's ready so you can pass me that gear. [Krystal] Two and a half years ago, I decided to stop signing petitions and liking things on Facebook and actually take a more direct action approach. I'm not afraid of what's gonna confront me. I just think that if I can't do this, then there's no point in doing anything, so bring it on. [Sid] So the plan is for us to pick up those buoys, connect it to the stern of the ship, get the buoys on board and then keep hauling the gear in. We've got sub-zero temperatures in the water. It's very, very cold with the wind and the existing swell, it's pretty dangerous conditions. [bleep] [man speaking] [Krystal speaking] Echo, this is Bridge. Over. Hey, Krystal. As soon as we've got the buoy, you can climb out. Really sorry, but just hold on. [Sid] Everybody knows that, when they join a Sea Shepherd ship, and they go on a campaign, they're putting their lives on the line. Duty always triumphs. [Krystal speaking] Oh, yeah. And then later we'll retrieve the boat. [tense music playing] [Krystal moaning] Can't feel anything. [gasping] Oh, there's a big fish. [Sid] Toothfish is sold in restaurants as Chilean seabass. It's mainly a fish that ends up in fancy dinner plates, top-end restaurants, and 5-five star hotels across the world. So it's not a fish that you would use to feed the hungry children in Africa. Their survival is very important to control the deep depths of Antarctica. And when there's illegal vessels that take apex predators, they're actually causing a collapse of the food chain and from a marine ecosystem that we don't understand. That's the problem with toothfish that we haven't understood them, but we're ready to eat them. Bye, fish. - Was he alive? - Yeah! Yay! God, that's so good. Oh, my God. That's such a good feeling. [calm music playing] [Sid] I remember seeing my first iceberg and being in complete awe and feeling like I had left behind the planet that I was used to. Antarctica is probably the richest ocean that we've got left. Gillnetting has no place in Antarctica and that gear needs to be put on the back deck of the Sam Simon. All right, let's keep pulling it. [Sid] 12 days of back-breaking work, we've hauled in close to 50 kilometers of net on board, but our job is far from being over. We're just continuing to find more and more nets the Thunder had laid out. We're not even close to being finished. And the number of dead animals we've pulled out is astounding, you know? [man] It feels like it's an airplane crash. There's just body after another after another. This is definitely the worst thing that I've ever done in my life. [Krystal] It's difficult physical work. I think everyone's bodies are tired and aching. And we're not getting enough sleep and hauling in so much dead marine life, and it's awful. But this is what we're here for and this is what we have to do. And the alternative is to give up, which none of us are prepared to do. [phone ringing] [Peter] Hey, Sid. What's going on? We've got 448, I think, toothfish. That's the total count. They're all dead. Yeah, it's been in the water much longer, I guess. So, it's good evidence of the effects of a ghost net. [Sid] This net has been down in the ocean for about nine days. It's basically killing endlessly. Well, well done to you and the crew, Sid. And if the Thunder decides to resume their illegal fishing, then we're going to stop them. Yeah, absolutely. Let's keep watching at the back and slowly. Coming. They've got their fishing lights on. Yeah, that stern... [trails off indistinctly] [beeping] Oh, I see it. [Peter] What is the point of having laws if laws aren't going to be enforced? More than half of the world's population depend on the oceans for their survival. Illegal fishing completely jeopardizes any chance of there being sustainable fishing. When government lacks either political will, economic means or the jurisdiction to enforce those laws, then it fall upon private organizations like Sea Shepherd to fill that role. Thunder, this is Bob Barker. You are fishing illegally. Shut down your illegal fishing activities immediately or we will have to intervene. Well, there's nothing we can do really while it's this dark. So we monitor it, we start prepping for first light. [Adam] Okay. [Peter] Morning, everyone. You all know what happened last night, of course. So, the Thunder fished. To block them from fishing should be quite simple because the first thing they have to put out is this 2-kilometer-long lead line with a buoy at the end. So out of the back will come this buoy and then, following that, will be the net. The net then drops down as they put out buoy after buoy. We're going to have several grappling hooks set on the bow of our ship. From the bow, we'll throw some grappling hooks down, we'll pull it up, we'll cut the buoys off, and without the buoy, they can't set the net. They have a limited number of buoys on board, so all we have to do is keep cutting that end buoy. Sooner or later, they're going to have to give up. Do you see the buoy anywhere? [Paola] No, not yet. There's no crew coming out all geared up. Oh, the buoys are over there. They've got the buoys there, Peter. We gotta get ahead of them. Go and get some life jackets on and get on the bow with the people you need to do it. Grab a radio. [man] Yeah, I've got a radio. [Peter] If they do try to fish, then they've got to go through us to do it. - Where are they at now? - Dead ahead. - Dead ahead? - Dead ahead. [Paola] Dead ahead, yeah. [captain of Thunder speaking on radio] - We stopped? - [Adam] Yeah, we're stopped. [man] They're getting ready for the buoys. [Paola] They're getting ready. - [Peter] This is it. - [Adam] Got it. Got it. Pull it up. Come on. Tell them to hurry up 'cause the Thunder is coming at us. [man] Peter says hurry up, the Thunder's coming back towards us. Over. [Thunder captain] Bob Barker. Bob Barker. Thunder. Thunder. Bob Barker. [speaking Spanish] - They're going to come in pretty aggressively now. - Yeah. Tell people to come in from deck and to go to the muster station. Pull it up, come on. Tell them to tell us as soon as it's up and cut free from the ship. Buoy, can you please tell us as soon as we're free from the line? Over. [ringing] [Peter] They probably feel backed into a corner and that makes them unpredictable and potentially quite dangerous. Speed up a little bit, please, Adam. [horn blowing] They're making a hard turn, eh? [speaking Spanish] Give it a kick of stern. [horn blowing] [Wyanda] Stand by for possible impact. [Peter] That's gonna be close. [horn blowing] Phew. - [Adam] Nice, Peter. - [Peter] That must've been a meter. - [laughing] - [man] I could have jumped that. Yeah. - What are we at? - [Adam] 10 ahead. [Peter] Let's give it 20 ahead. 20 ahead? Let's let them calm down a bit. It's that Spanish temperament. 8.9 knots they're doing now? [Adam] Yeah. [Adam] They think somehow that they're gonna shake us and be able to get away with continuing to pillage the oceans. That's just not gonna happen. [Peter] The plan went exactly the way we'd hoped it'd go. The deck crew has done a great job of pulling the buoys up. They did it really quickly. [Alistair] It was a huge victory for us and it's really annoyed the Thunder, and, hopefully, ended their fishing operation. - [Peter] Was it heavy? - [Alistair] No, no. I mean, a little bit, but nothing unmanageable. - We'll see what happens next. - [Alistair] We'll see what happens. [man] This might deter them from putting out anything anymore. [Peter] Mmm. My hope is that that fishing gear will be able to further link the Thunder to the gillnets that the Sam Simon crew is pulling up. [waves crashing] [calm music playing] [Sid] When I came out on watch this morning, I wasn't feeling excited about it at all. Here we go again. [bleep] hell. But with the Sam Simon actually locating the gear and confiscating that gear, we actually now we can build a strong case to help prosecute the Thunder and shut it down. [man] We've got toothfish last, 23. - [man 2] We have nine. - Toothfish last, we've got 22. [Sid] It's a massive challenge, going down to Antarctica, this remote edge of the planet with a volunteer crew. A lot of them are young people for the first time at sea. Not everyone knows what they're going to go up against, but they've come here with the purpose to defend and fight for the oceans. We've extracted close to 700 toothfish. That adds up to 21 tons, which is roughly $210,000 at retail price. And the gear's worth another $120,000. That's spectacular. [Sid] We're risking our crew every time they're working on these high-tension lines. That's it. You're trying to get the trap? 'Cause it's not going to come up. There's too much tension again. [indistinct chatter] [Sid] That'll be the end of the hauling. Yeah, that's it. It's good to call it quits while we're ahead. We've got 70 kilometers of line and I think that is enough evidence to prosecute. Well, you guys must've heard this morning that we were hauling and then the roller bent. And I made the decision that we're moving on. What we do have to look forward to is that we're heading straight for the Bob Barker. - [Krystal] Are we? - [Sid] Yes. So weather giving us a good passage, we should be there in six to seven days. We can meet up with our friends on the Bob who have been in an epic 52-day pursuit of the Thunder. We'll confront the Thunder with the Bob Barker in an aim to break the back of the moral of the Thunder. Let them see all the 72 kilometers of line that we have on deck. [Peter] We're almost at the 2-month mark. It is our 58th day of pursuit of the Thunder. As long as we can remain with them, the only option for the Thunder is to be escorted into port by the Bob Barker. This is very much a psychological game we're playing with them. We want to demoralize them and crush their fighting spirit. [Sid on radio] Bob Barker. Bob Barker. Sam Simon. Sam Simon. Bob Barker. Hey, Peter. Lovely to see all of you. Is it nice to finally see the Thunder? It is pretty special to see them. We've got a lot of the Thunder's gear - and we're going in close to show them. - Okay. That sounds good. [Sid] The biggest part of the Sam Simon in this whole investigation is linking the gear that we have on board with the Thunder. Whenever she returns to port, law enforcement can match this with evidence on the Thunder and then the Thunder can't refuse any of this gear as being hers. Yeah, all taking photos on the starboard end port. [Thunder captain speaking] Go get them, Sid! Thunder. Thunder. This is Sam Simon on channel 16. Go ahead. [speaking Spanish] Tell them that all the gear that they see on our ship is their illegal fishing gear from Antarctica, and that we are on our way to hand that over to law enforcement. [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [Sid] Tell him that is for the law enforcement to decide. And we'll be on 16 if they need to call us again. [speaking Spanish] [Peter] That's pretty close. - [Simon] Yeah. Jeez. - [Peter] That's a good photo. That's a great shot. Their crew could provide invaluable evidence. They may have no idea that the ship is fishing illegally. We want to establish a means of communication with them. Very often, nobody knows where their food comes from and, as being interested in the oceans, we always think about the fishing method. But there's also all these people who work on the fishing vessels. We know from the hauling on the Sam how difficult it is. So can you imagine working 16-20 hours during the fishing season? They often work between $100 and $150 a month. We have nothing against the people themselves, but the owners, the operators and the captain of the Thunder who are continuing to commit illegal fishing operations. So, our attempt is to send them a message about who we are. [Peter] "You've done nothing wrong. The captain and the owner must be brought to court to answer for their illegal fishing. Any information about the names of the officers and the owner of the ship will greatly help us. Sincerely, me, Captain Bob Barker." The Bob's going to stay with them for a while so this back-and-forth messaging can go on, and, hopefully, we'll get some messages back. [tense music playing] [woman on comms] Echo to Bridge. Echo is away. [Sid] If you care for the oceans and you care for the fish, then you have to care for the people who are involved. And we stand in spirit with the rights that should be given to the crew. Echo, this is Bridge. We will get closer to the Thunder, and we will sound our horn to shake them and wake them. [horn blowing] Sam's coming in closer now. Echo, this is Bridge. There is people standing in the door on the aft deck. So try and throw one bottle. [man] Oh, yeah. [Sid] Yeah, they seem to be coming. Bob. Bob. Sam. Sam. Bob. Hey, just letting you know that we did see - some activity after the fog horn. - Okay. The more you can throw over, the better. Yeah, will do. One more bottle. Echo, Bridge. Somebody is collecting the second bottle you threw. [Sid] They are reading it. They're making some hand signals. Who's got the bottle? Is it still in the boat? Ooh, big message. [woman speaking] We'll try and get it translated. We've just managed to get the translation. They are worried. They were not aware that the Thunder was fishing illegally. We want to try and do a second message to seek information on the status of the crew themselves, and if they had any messages that they'd like to pass on, we'd be happy to be a conduit to their families and friends. The Sam Simon is launching a small boat at 0900 hours. We have a new letter to the Indonesian crew. We have a guy up on the bridge there. We've never gone up against an adversary like this before. It's the unpredictability of them that makes them dangerous. Echo, this is Bridge. Just stand by and see what happens. Over. Flare. The guy-- Uh, the guy with the balaclava has gone in. - This is the time to do it. - [Wyanda] Echo, this is Sam Simon. The guy just went inside. You can return to the ship. Over. [man] All right. [Sid] Peter. Peter. Sid. Sid. Peter. We just spotted one of the officers, possibly, throwing two of the bottles back into the water. So I'm trying to just throw about ten more sets. Hopefully one of them stays. Okay, we'll just stay on-station here then on the starboard quarter. [man] Oh, balaclava's coming out. [Wyanda] He's out. He's out. He's out. [Peter] Balaclava man's coming out. He's got the chain or something in his hand, it looks like. Echo. Echo. Sam Simon. Read? Oh, what's that? [grunts] [Wyanda] Echo, this is Bridge. [indistinct radio chatter] [Wyanda] Echo. Stand by. [man] Copy that. [Sid] We know these vessels have catch worth millions of dollars. We were told by other fishermen that if we went up against them, there was a high likelihood that we'd be shot. Hey, Echo. We'll call it off. We don't want these guys to get too angry. So turn away and come back. [Peter] What happened? - You okay? - [man] Yeah. [Peter] I've sailed with Simon for many, many years. He's one of my crew members who most likes to be on the front lines. What's he throwing? He's threw a bolt at your nuts? You're okay? The Thunder has tried to ram us. They've thrown bolts and chains at us. They're beginning to crack and they're going to make a mistake. Atlas Cove. Atlas Cove. Bob Barker. Calling you seven, seven. [man on radio] Bob Barker, this is Atlas Cove. Wow. [horn blowing] It's really impressive, isn't it? [Peter] The Atlas Cove is a toothfish long-liner that conducts legal toothfish operations down in the Southern Ocean. -[man on radio] Go ahead, Peter. -[Peter] Are you comfortable giving us support for the campaign? Over. Yeah, roger to that here. [Peter] Oh, we appreciate that. This'll be a demoralizing blow for them. Yeah, I hope so. Yeah, it's one of the reasons we really wanted to bag this poacher. They've agreed to follow the Thunder for a little bit. All right. So we will have three vessels just following them. [Wyanda] It's going to be a blow to the Thunder now to realize it's not just a bunch of hippies that's trying to save the oceans, but it's actually backed up by the legal companies. [Peter] We want him to feel that there's no getting away. We want him to feel that the campaign is reaching a critical mass. Hey, Steve. It's very nice to see you here. It's good to be looking at a vessel that isn't the Thunder. Are you comfortable coming in within about two cables, one cable? All right, thanks for that, Atlas Cove. Standing by seven, seven. Yeah, that's fine. [speaking Spanish] [Peter] It's good to see that there are some conservation-minded fishermen out there. I think it's pretty clear to the captain and the crew of the Thunder that the entire world is against what they're doing, and they have no safe haven. [speaking Spanish] [Wyanda] And they didn't react to that at first. They just kept radio silence. And then, all of the sudden... [Peter] Oh, they're turning. We need more RPM. [Thunder crew member] You realize that you're a tiny, little boat which has a huge steel ship that is trying to act aggressively towards us. [horn blowing] [Wyanda] The Thunder went right in between the Bob and the Atlas Cove and there was only a cable between them. [man] The Thunder tries to show that they're aggressive to show how big their balls are. To me, I think it just shows the desperation they're feeling. [Peter] The captain of the Thunder feels like he's trapped. There's nowhere left for him to run. [Thunder captain speaking Spanish] [Sid] If someone says "I'm not afraid" 25 times, it probably means that they are beginning to tire and get afraid of what lies ahead when they reach port. [Thunder captain speaking Spanish] He says he doesn't mind if his ship sinks? - [man] Yeah, that's it. - Wow. [Sid] Tell him, "Good." As long as he stays in international waters, he's gonna have the ships with him. He has call port at some point. [Thunder captain speaking Spanish] Atlas Cove. Bob Barker. Seven, seven. He's obviously quite flustered, and I think... I think we've accomplished what we set to achieve in demoralizing him. I don't think I've ever heard the captain of that ship so stressed before. Over. Okay, well, safe sailing there, Steve. And we'll have the crew ready to wave you off and then wish you a safe passage. Thank you. [Thunder crew member] He was saying that he wasn't afraid and just saying that his crew was afraid. The reality is that the captain was the one asking us not to get close and just wondering why there is this fleet behind his ship. [Peter] I certainly think that we heard him... break psychologically. And I think this is probably the worst day that he has had of this chase. [horn blowing] Hey, Peter. We'll just go past your stern and give the crew a chance to say goodbye, - then we'll be on our way. - It's been great -having you guys here. We're really gonna miss you. -Good luck out here. And hopefully things go as we've planned. Thanks, my friend, see you soon. See you soon. Bye! Bye, Sid! [yelling] [Sid] We'll be heading towards Mauritius. When we get there, we'll have someone from Interpol come for statements and photographs and evidence collection. Let them see all the 72 kilometers of line that we have lying across on the Sam's deck. Then we'll refuel and reprovision our ship and then come back to resupply the Bob Barker. [Peter] Once again, we're alone down here. The Thunder and the Bob Barker have entered a waiting game. Their only option to avoid arrest is to try to outlast the Bob Barker. We have a war of attrition on our hands. It's a battle where both sides are in the trenches staring at each other to see who's going to make the next move. [McDonnell] All the way through the chase, there were photographs being taken of people on the bridge which would be shared with national enforcement agencies. It grew organically like that and we expanded the operational group. Twenty-five countries have contributed something to this. So as the Thunder moved towards South Africa then South Africa and Nigeria became more involved. It has been one of the biggest things that we've done. They've been an iconic gang. The fact is that there are lots of other gangs out there doing similar or worse things and we need to tackle them as well. [Sid] Well, yesterday, in conversation with the officials who came in from Interpol at the meeting that we had at the police's headquarters, one of the biggest parts of the Sam Simon in this whole investigation is linking the gear that we have on board with the Thunder. There's specific things like... Like this, you know? Crossing a knot, passing it back through this. Even the way there's three orange buoys with two foam floats just to be able to spot it from the surface. The group over there is recreating a gillnet, so there's little twines that hold the gillnet up. There's a specific spacing, there's a specific knot, there's a specific construction. [woman] It's sort of a signature for these fishermen. So then when the Thunder does return to port and they have lines on board, all we have to do is look at their lines and the splicing and the connections, and compare the two together. [McDonnell] This is analogous to a blood-stained jacket at a murder scene. You know, where you're gonna look at the cloth, the thread, the buttons. Where did all this come from? [Sid] Welcome again. [man] We really have to put a lot of faith in the Interpol system. We're doing the job of authorities at sea, and so now it's time for them to pick up their side of the bargain at this end. And after seeing the way Interpol went around the ship, I'm very hopeful. [man 2] We've just spent almost 90 days now of following the Thunder, and when they go back to port, they're gonna have Interpol to face and the courts and that's not looking very good for them. And the same thing will happen for any other poaching vessels out there on the high seas. [Peter] Today is our 100th day with the Thunder. Recently, we've received the news that the country of Nigeria has removed the flag from the Thunder and that will make it near impossible for them to enter any port without detention. [drilling] Right now, after 100 days, I feel somewhat exhausted, but also invigorated. [woman] We have covered three oceans now. We've got our eyes on our target. So we're not gonna let them go. [woman speaking] [Peter] Uh, could you let Irwin know just to bring the revs up? [Peter] It's really black, whatever's burning now. [Peter] What do you think, Adam? Yesterday, the Thunder had a big burn on their aft deck. I don't really know what they're burning. They maintained radio silence so as to add confusion. We'll keep our eye on them. Thunder. Bob Barker. [speaking foreign language] Thunder. Thunder. Thunder. Bob Barker. Bob Barker. [speaking foreign language] I think they decided that we weren't on talking terms. [man speaking] They're burning the evidence. Maybe they're gonna go into port. [distress call] There's at least a dozen people on the aft deck. All wearing orange. [Thunder captain] Bob Barker, it's Thunder. [speaking Spanish] [Parker] He's got a problem and they're sinking? [sighs] [man speaking] Ask them where's the water coming in. [speaking Spanish] Fifteen minutes, he said. It's not gonna sink in 15 minutes. [ringing alarm] [Peter] Just keep doing circles. We gotta get a boat in the water. [indistinct radio chatter] [Peter] I'm finding it hard to believe that the flooding would be of such an extent if it's happening at all to actually sink the vessel. One of my concerns is that the captain of the Thunder is keeping a skeleton crew on board his ship to flee the scene when I start rescuing his crew. Perhaps they'll actually go to one of these West African countries to try to offload their illegal catch. They can arrive before the international criminal police can liaise with local authorities to get the vessel detained. - Get Sid on the phone. - Copy that. [phone ringing] - Sam Simon, this is Sid. - [Peter] Hey, Sid. So it's a very surreal situation we've got here. We've got the captain of the Thunder putting out a distress on VFC. The distress is sinking, they're abandoning ship right now. We're putting a boat in the water to recover them. You think it's sort of a hoax call? I don't know, they're abandoning ship right now. How close are you? [Sid] I'm about 36 miles away. It'll take at least three hours to get there. Straight for us as quick as you can. - Okay, Peter. - Thanks. Talk soon. Bye. I need top speed. [Peter] I think they're getting ready for their endgame. This is very suspicious. I don't feel like the Thunder's sinking very quickly. Ask him how many persons on board. How many crew. [speaking Spanish] He said they have 40. [Peter] So I just checked that everybody's okay and, uh, we'll take it from there. - They'll probably like it. - Yeah. All right, good. [tense music playing] Gemini. Bob. Go ahead. Can you check the life rafts on port side? See how many persons are in there. So that means five people are still on board the Thunder. Okay. Thanks. [phone ringing] [Peter] Hey, Sid. We've got about 35 of the crew in life rafts. Do not take the crew on board until you have support on site. The Nigerian shipping directory has replied to the report that I sent out saying it is very likely a ploy by the Thunder to stop you from chasing her. And that the people that you bring on board could be armed, hostile and dangerous. [Peter] The Thunder is drifting into the waters of Sao Tome in Equatorial Guinea. The vessel is listing to starboard, but I don't really know whether the ship is actually sinking or if the captain is just transferring valves from one side of the ship to the other. Gemini. Bob. Copy. [woman] I can see one man on the bridge deck still. [man on radio] Bob Barker. [speaking Spanish] He said he needs us to take the people from the life rafts, because they're cold and nervous. Ask him to calm them down. The weather's good. We're gonna keep them in the life raft until another ship comes. We're gonna give them water and food and anything they need. If I take 40 foreign persons on board, then that more than triples the people I have on board. It becomes a very difficult situation. They've been violent to my crew and so I don't really wanna take anybody on board until the Sam Simon arrives. [Thunder captain speaking Spanish] He said we're not respecting the law. Oh, come on. Tell him we're the on scene coordinator. We're dealing with this the safest way possible. They'll be perfectly fine, we've got another ship coming in two hours. Tell him to take care of his sinking ship. [speaking Spanish] The captain of the Thunder has set his crew adrift. But he's delaying abandoning the ship himself. Very, very strange behavior for somebody who wants to be rescued. It looks like they're sinking now. Once I see the water reach the hauling area on the Thunder, I know that the vessel, for certain, is going to sink. The stability of the Thunder is changing. Tell him we're gonna use our small boat. We're gonna put a line on the life raft, so we're gonna tow them to us, and we're gonna attach them to us until the Sam Simon arrives. [speaking Spanish] Tell him we're not taking anybody on board until the captain and the chief engineer get off the ship as well. [speaking Spanish] I suspect that the Thunder captain refuses to leave the boat because he's probably sinking his own ship. - Yeah. - [Peter] They don't want anybody to get the boat. The boat's evidence and he wants to ensure that the vessel will actually sink before disembarking. It's just a real desperate move, no matter how you look at it. So the story ends out here, at the bottom of the sea. Tell him get the rest of his crew off so we can take all of them on board. [speaking Spanish] Tell the son of a bitch. Tell him his crew have attacked my crew. We cannot take them on board until I know that all 40 people are on the life rafts. [speaking Spanish] We can deal with all of this later. Tell him to get on his [bleep] boat so we can take him on board. We're gonna argue about this for an hour while he's sinking? We have both a moral and a legal obligation to uphold the safety of life at sea. But, at the same time, I have to take into account the safety of my own crew and my own vessel. [man] Share between the two. [Peter] The Sam Simon is the best vessel to take on the Thunder crew. We should be able to see them in, like, ten minutes. [Peter] They haven't been pursuing the Thunder for all 110 days. So it's likely that there's less bad blood between the two ships. [Sid] Cordon off the stairs on the back deck. If we do recover crew, they're not just gonna be just walking around. They're gonna be confined to the back deck. The possibility of bringing 40 crew from the Thunder onto the Sam Simon obviously weighs heavily on my mind right now. We'll have twice the amount of people, all of them with a lot of anger against us. It's a bit unnerving. It's hard to imagine how this day will end. [Peter] Got it. Hey there, Sid. So we got a visual on you. Just wondering when you wanna reach out to the Thunder. Okay, thanks. That looks like the captain guy getting on right now. Gemini, do you think everybody has evacuated the vessel? [Peter] With the arrival of the Sam Simon, I get the report that the Thunder captain has finally disembarked. [man] Good morning. Anybody speaks English? Bob Barker. Bob Barker. This is Echo. The life raft is no longer attached to the ship. Over. Okay. Copy that. [Peter] I feel happy knowing all of the crew must have left the Thunder and that there's no immediate danger to anybody's lives. But I wanted to see this vessel go into port, I wanted to see a court. Use the physical evidence on board to track down the owners and deliver justice, and all of that becomes more difficult with the vessel sinking. - Sam. Bob. - Hey, Peter. - Sid, go ahead. - Just wanna run something by you. What do you think about putting somebody on the Thunder to see if they've left any paperwork behind on the bridge? I think that's a great idea. But go before she sinks any further. - Okay. - Okay, Peter. Thanks. [Peter] When the captain of the Thunder sees that three of my crew members are boarding his abandoned vessel, I can see that his mood immediately sours. He realizes that we may be able to get some of the evidence that he hasn't been able to ensure would go down to the bottom of the ocean. It's going down fast. Let's give them another five minutes on board - then let's get these guys off. - All right. I don't want them to stay on too long. Roger that. You have about five more minutes and then come on get off the boat, okay? Yeah, I told them that seven minutes ago. Irwin. Irwin. Bob Barker. Get off that ship. Over. - Are they still on the boat? - Yeah, they've been told repeatedly to get off. [Peter] They're really drawing it out here. Gemini. Bob Barker Bridge. This boat's going down much quicker now. So get them off. Irwin. Irwin, Adam. Irwin, Bob Barker Bridge. Anteo. Anteo, Adam. I really want these guys to disembark. - Roger that. - Good job. [Peter] After finding the Thunder down in the Southern Ocean, we chased them across three oceans. Over the 110 days, we covered over 10,000 miles. Why you here? [yelling indistinctly] Finally the captain decided to sink his own ship, but the courage of my boarding team has ensured that the legal case against the captain and officers of the Thunder can continue. We took one computer from the bridge. - Yeah, we got that. - A mobile phone... - Two mobile phones from the bridge, I think. - [man] Yeah, some charts. - And all the charts that they had in their drawers. - Yep. Great. All the doors were tied open, so that it would flood. There's water already inside the fish hatch. - [Peter] Was there a lot of fish on board? - Yeah. Bags and bags of fish. Okay. All right, good job. [Peter] All right, let's have a look. There's no head, huh? [woman] No head, but from the size and the flesh color, - I'd say it's definitely toothfish. - Yeah? Yeah. [Peter] We set out to shut down toothfish poachers in the Southern Ocean and the evidence that the illegal activities of the Thunder is now on our freezer. [Thunder captain speaking] Bob Barker, this is Echo. The Spanish crew is pretty nervous about the filming. They want us to stop. The guys in that raft are not comfortable with the filming. [Peter] The captain of the Thunder becomes very, very difficult. I think he doesn't really want to be rescued by myself. I think ideally he'd like to be rescued by some vessel where he can hopefully then get onto land somewhere and disappear. Echo. Echo. This is Bob Barker. [man] Everything points at a deliberate scuttling. [speaking Spanish] [Thunder crew member] We're passing them a line so we can tie it to them. Don't bother if you're gonna be like that. [Peter] It's important to get this evidence to Interpol so that we can see the captain jailed for his crimes. Sam. Bob. Bob Barker. Sam Simon. Go ahead. You can see she's going down a bit quicker now. The bow's coming out of the water considerably. The fish hold hatch was open. The ship's basically been prepped to sink. They're actually scuttling their own ship? It seems to indicate that. [Sid] For someone to go out and plan a sinking of their own ship means that they have a lot of pressure from the owners to not allow the vessel to go into port. Yeah, there's no doubt in my mind that it was intentionally sunk. [Peter] My life mission has been to shut this vessel down, and, within minutes, this vessel will simply cease to exist. Attention, all crew. Attention, all crew. Looks like the Thunder's going down. That's insane. That's [bleep] radars and antennas and thousands of dollars' worth of gear that is sinking. It's hard to fathom. [Wyanda] In a way, it just shows how much money they're making. - [Sid] I know! - That they're willing to give all this up. [tense music playing] Oh, my God. [man] All right. [calm music playing] [laughing] Time is 12:52. - 12:52. The Thunder is gone. - There's some stuff over there. It's out of this world to see a ship go down like that. A ship that was perfectly fine this morning. Not what I was expecting when I woke up this morning. Just like in the movies, the bow went up. Big bellow of air came out of it, and it just went right down to the bottom. [man] I think of all the scenarios that went through our heads, this was not on any of our minds. This just shows a desperate guilty act, you know? - Bob. Bob. Sam. - Sam. Bob. Go ahead. How bizarre was it watching the Thunder go down? Unreal. Just... Just unreal. I felt my knees buckle a little bit. I couldn't have foreseen this in a million years. [Sid] Now that the Thunder had sunk and the Sam Simon has to rescue the captain and the crew and contact the authorities to take the rescued people to Interpol for questioning. Okay, so here's the plan. We will embark people from one life raft at a time. I mean, one person at a time comes on board. They're checked to make sure they've got no weapons. We'll do that with each life raft at a time and then I'll call you back. It's a sudden shift of emotions to move from tailing the vessel to now being the rescuers of the very people who we've been chasing for the last 110 days. Just throw it to them so that they can attach it. Just knowing that there's a captain who's willingly scuttled his boat is in a weak position but is personally very angry at us, and we are the cause for him actually being in a life raft at the moment. It's a tough one. Giving the unique circumstances of our history, this would not be a regular rescue mission. Bridge, we can make a logbook entry that we'll start embarking the other crew. Over. The captain needs to be the first one who comes on board so that he and I can have a face-to-face. I have to air on the side of extreme caution. The intentions and motives of the Thunder captain and the crew are unknown. And just have the captain come up. Hey, okay. - I'm the captain of the Sam Simon. - Yes, you're captain. Do you speak English, or would you prefer Spanish? English, Spanish, I've got no problem. We're gonna take all your crew on board the Sam Simon and then we're gonna go to Sao Tome. - Sao Tome? Okay. - Can I have a crew list of your vessel, please? - All the crew bring nothing. - What about their passports? Passports? No. It's very, very fast. - No, it takes six hours. - Very, very fast. [Sid] One of the biggest ways to holding on to crews on illegal ships is for the captain to keep travel documents of the crew. Okay. One at the time, they can come on board. Seemed that he was really holding on to the passports. Lying that they are all sunk with the ship and then as they were brought on by somebody else, I caught on to that and managed to give the passports back to the crew. The Indonesian crew are not responsible for these crimes of the Thunder. They're innocent men. Can you ask him why he thinks that the Thunder sank? [speaking Spanish] He was sleeping? All right. Can you tell us why the Thunder sank? -As the chief engineer. -[man] Yeah. Boom! Go to engine room. Water. Water. Water. Water. So "boom" as you hit something or "boom" in the engine room? - No, no. Hit something. - You hit something? - I think so. - Okay. Okay. Okay. Muchas gracias. He's the fish master. Fish master. We don't have to ask him 'cause he's not gonna answer. He does not have to answer. Thank you. [Wyanda] It is impossible to have a ship full of people and nobody knows. They have clearly been told to tell us nothing. [man] What is it going with the security, security? [Sid] We need to check the documents. I don't know who this people are. I need to stablish an identity. This is a special situation, you know. You and I both know what is behind the accident. - Okay. Okay. - So we have to be-- [Sid] Understand. And the security, security-- I have to look after my security. I'm going to do it according to my procedures. - Don't tell me how I should do it on my ship. - Okay. I get it. I picked you up. I'm going to take them to Sao Tome. What I have to do is my responsibility, yeah? Okay? - Okay. Okay. - Yeah. Hey, Peter, just checking in. We've got the captain on board. Is he aggressive? Is he violent? What's his behavior like? He came on very quietly, then he got a bit agitated. And then we had a discussion. Just kept saying that I'm not treating him right, but that doesn't bother me. So I'm just gonna turn due east to Sao Tome now. - Copy that. - All right. I'll be standing by. Thanks, Peter. [Sid] All right, Sonya. Ten and a half knots. In the transit from the Thunder's sinking location to Sao Tome, I passed on messages to the relevant channels. We decided that the crew of the Thunder would now all be taken to the local Interpol in Sao Tome where they will be held for questioning. The case will then progress from there. When I saw the Thunder captain sitting on the Thunder's gear that the Sam Simon had confiscated, I knew that he resigned himself to his destiny. He lost his ship, his fishing profits, his freedom. Okay. I will have one of my crew members standing by to receive your personnel and, the moment you're on board, I will come down and meet you personally. Over. [indistinct conversation] Now that the crew of the Thunder has got on to the boat to Sao Tome, the campaign has just ended. The Thunder crew sank their ship this morning all because of us. She sits at the bottom of the ocean. Suddenly, tomorrow morning, when I get up, there's no poaching vessel to look after. [laughing and clapping] This campaign started with a pretty crazy idea that we would just find one of these poachers and we would follow them for... forever or however long it took and then we would just kinda see what happens. I've been with Sea Shepherd for 12 years, this has been the most epic campaign that I've ever been a part of. Certainly, the campaign I'm the most proud of. All 40 have been taken to the local Interpol headquarters. Their plans to get away by scuttling their vessel haven't really come to much and they'll gonna be held for questioning, specially the fishing master and the captain. This is-- has been the biggest adventure of my life and I'm really grateful that I've been able to share it all with you. So you trusted me from the beginning. I know there were a lot of difficult times. And I think what we've said multiple times over this campaign which is that when a group of determined people come together, you can move mountains, and I think that's what we've done through this whole campaign. Ultimately, on Peter's and my behalf, I want to say thank you. I hope we'll have many more adventures together. [cheering and clapping] [man] Three cheers for Peter! - Hip hip! - [all] Hooray! - Hip hip! - [all] Hooray! - Hip hip! - [all] Hooray! [all cheering] [narrator] In 2015, a court in Sao Tome fined the owners and captain of the Thunder and two of the ship's officers 15 million euros for charges related to the illegal sinking of their vessel. The captain and officers received multiple-year jail sentences for their actions. [McDonnell] It was a significant achievement by Sea Shepherd, but the Thunder was one of the group of six vessels, the banded six who've been involved in unregulated fishing in the Southern Ocean. We've been tackling the others at the same time. One is detained in Senegal and a couple were in Cape Verde. In Malaysia, prosecuted the Perlon. Indonesia had some success. So what we're saying is, overall, we've disrupted the operation severely as a result of international corporation delivering some severe blows to this network. [narrator] In the spring of 2016, Spanish Guardia Civil arrested members of the Vidal family, long-suspected of playing a key role in the illegal toothfish industry. Charges were dismissed by the Spanish supreme court due to lack of criminal jurisdiction on the high seas, but the facts were not disputed. [Alistair] A key part of the strategy is to disrupt the activities that the people were facilitating, the transactions, the agents ashore. And that relies on strong national legislations, which is the case now in Spain. We're going at this from all angles. [Sid] We always go out to these campaigns knowing that we're mentally stronger and more determined to take on these opponents and I feel we're very persistent with what we do. We're a stubborn group of people who never, ever give up. That's what eventually wears the opponent down. [Peter] This campaign is going to go down in history because 29 crew on this ship and 30 on the Sam Simon did what the governments could not do in eight years and that was to shut down this poacher. It will inspire groups and other movements and other causes. If you see a problem, it's not enough to just sit by and hope that it goes away. It requires your personal involvement. [tense music playing]
