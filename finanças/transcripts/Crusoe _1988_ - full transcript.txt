Take care of him. Yes, sir. Morning, Mr. Crusoe. Good morning. What do you have? Six men, four women, one pregnant. First sale or resale? First sale. Sign here. Colcol. I don't think he likes me. Do you? I wouldn't think so. Thank you, sir. A fine buck, and at a fair price. Lot 122, Mr. Tweetie. Lot 122, gentlemen. Female, name of Easter. 5' 4", eight stone five pounds. Sound and healthy. A clear blue-black complexion and, I'm told, a musical voice. Gentlemen, may we start the bidding at $150? $150, thank you. I'm going to $200, who will accompany me? $200, thank you, sir. Do I hear $250? $250? $250? Come, gentlemen, $300. $350, thank you, sir. $350. $350. $350. $350... $400! $400. $400. $400. $400. $450? Thank you. $450. Anyone say $500? Thank you. $500. $500. $500. Going, going, gone, to Mr. Gospel for $500. Thank you, sir. Good choice. Mr. Tweetie, field hands. Thank you, gentlemen. Field hands. ...Crusoe. Yes, Crusoe? Mr. Mather, I need the ship for another run. Well, it's a little late in the year, isn't it? I know it's late in the year. But I found out the pens in Guinea are crammed. Well, what do you reckon you can buy them for? $45 for a buck, $20 for a girl. Are you sure? Positive. Really? Yes, I'm certain. Crusoe, you're a liar. If those pens are crammed, it's $25 for a buck, it's $10 for a girl. Look, I like your ambition. And when your ambition makes me money, I like it even more. Then give me the ship. All right, all right. Captain Harding will be in command. You'll consign to me your stocks, your stables as security against damage or loss. Are we agreed? Thank you, we are agreed. Thank you very much, Mr. Mather. Boy! Here. Come here. I'll take that. What... But that's for Mr. Crusoe. Yes, I know who it's for. It just needs a little flavor, that's all. There, now. Real man's brew. Go on, take it to Mr. Crusoe. Go on. Knock on the door. Mr. Crusoe, sir. Your water. Bless us, O Lord, for these gifts. Guide us with thy infinite wisdom to find the ship's course and, please, protect us from the sea. Amen. Thank you, Reverend. Usual weather, Captain? Ask the Lord, Reverend Milne. This is our first autumn crossing. Providence willed it. Don't thank Providence, Reverend. Mr. Crusoe is our benefactor. Oh, no, no, no, no. Providence it is, sir, though it wears Mr. Crusoe's face. The ship carries Christ's spirit into Africa. Reverend, the crew might appreciate a few words. To bolster their spirits. Yes. Scamp. Get out. Man overboard! Hold it, Jack! Hold it! You don't understand! We're dead! Captain! Captain! I think you'd better get up on deck, sir. It's as bad up there as I've ever seen. Get--Get out. Oh, my God. Hello! Anyone hear me? Scamp? You all right? What am I supposed to do, come down and get you? Where the hell are we, Scamp? No! My curse on this island. Come here, Scamp. See our general store? Hello? If not mine, whose are they? Speak up! Going, going, gone! To the man with no shirt. A little drink. To me. "We shall reach the slave coast tomorrow." Scamp. Go out there. Go see what it is. I said, go see what it is. Go on! A lot of good you are! Come here, piggy, piggy. Here, pig. Scamp? Scamp! Oh, my God. Come here. Come here! I will see you at supper. Suppertime. Come on. Why aren't you eating? What's the matter? No meat? Come on, eat. Eat. You know I hate eating alone. Come here. Let me feel your nose. Oh, you're sick. No wonder, this time of year. Rotten old weather. I'm not feeling well myself. But I'm eating. I'm eating. Scamp? Do you know what I'm gonna do for you? I'm going to give you my bed tonight. How's that? How's that, Scamp? Come on, Scamp. Come on, Scamp. Get up. There, there, lad. Down the hatch. Go to sleep. You'll feel better in the morning. Scamp. Good night. Good night. Lord, I beg you for my dog's life. He's such a good dog. I have come to need him. Without him... I shudder to think of life on this island without him. Thank you, Lord. Amen. Off they go! You're a lucky man. You're lucky first because you're alive, second because you have a man like me as your master. And third because I have no one to sell you to. I have no one to sell you to! Sit. Wait! Okay, eat. Meat. It's good. No? Wipe that off your face, would you, please? Your face. Would you wipe it off, please? Wipe it off your face. That's it. Very good, Lucky. My name is, Crusoe. You're Lucky and I'm Crusoe. My name is Crusoe. Master. Can you say "master"? We'll do better tomorrow. One day at a time. And the better I can trust you, the better you'll be treated. Good night. I hope the bedbugs don't bite. Lucky! Let me down, you... Get out of here, you... No. Put your toe on it and pull the trigger. Trigger. No, no... No. Don't do that. Don't do that! Is that my goose you're eating? My goose. Back! Meat? Meat. You understand? You're eating meat. Fire. Fire. Hot. Fire. Tree. Leaves. Ocean. Sea. Sand. Sand. Meat. Sand. Meat. Meat. Jala. Meat, meat, meat, meat, meat, meat. Jala. Jala? Meat. Meat! That's right! Meat!

Up here! Who are you, sir? My name is Crusoe. You intend to keep the cannibal, Doctor? When we return, I intend to present our friend above to the Northern Institute. So you'll sell him to the Institute, will you, Doctor? I am a scientist, not a slave dealer, Mr. Mipps. He will live at the Institute. Be better off there than he is here. These tribes are a simple mass. They don't think of themselves as individuals. Do they, Mr. Crusoe? I'd like to get some information about the cannibal's habits. I had a thought. Alongside the cannibal exhibit, you could lecture about your experiences on the island.
