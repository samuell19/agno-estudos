When I was in seventh grade, my teacher gave me a book of poems. "I am the master of my fate," the first one said. "I am the captain of my soul." [ Crying, screaming ] [ Indistinct shouting ] No! Damn it! Get back here! Get back here! [ Indistinct shouting, sobbing ] Get in there! Get in here! King county sheriff! Put down your weapon! [ Grunting ] Man: Get on the ground! [ Indistinct shouting ] Just stay down! [ Siren wailing in distance ] Dave? Yeah? We're putting you on homicide backup till your neck heals. No, sir, look, I'm fine. No, you're just lucky. You could be dead. I'm sick of your hot-dogging. For the next two weeks, you're chained to that desk. Yes, sir. You answer a call. You catch the case. Yes, sir. But don't count on it. Things have been very quiet. Mariners lost, Dave. You owe me lunch. Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. Luck, fate, god, the magic 8-ball... isn't it all the same? Me, I didn't believe in fate. I believed in luck and bad luck, and sometimes I believed in choice. Do you choose your luck?

I mean, who chose it for Wendy coffield? She met her luck when she disappeared from her foster home in early July and they found her below the peck bridge. She was 16. She was a hooker. Man: Jim, want to bag that? There's some paint on the victim's clothes. So, where's your real dad? Dead... he bought some bad drugs. Where's yours? I haven't seen him since I was 5. Yeah, my mom goes through men like toilet paper. Okay, see, this is the newest one. He always has his mouth full, so I call him the grunt. [ Chuckles ] Hi, Wallace! [ Grunts ] See? [ Laughter, telephone ringing ] Helen: But when god or someone else chooses your luck, is that the same thing as fate? How can we be masters of our fate if we have nothing to do with choosing it? Reichert. Fae: They just pulled a woman's body out of the green river. It looks bad. Where? Below mill creek near that rock base below the rapids. You know the one? Yeah. No, I know where it is. Uniforms are all over it, but I think it's a homicide. I'll be right there. [ Camera shutter clicking ] Man: Just like the one last month. What do you mean?

Dave: It's the second body discovered in a month in the green river. Both girls were prostitutes. That's all we have at the moment. Do you think he's a serial, like Ted Bundy? I don't think so, no. At least, I hope not. No, I just mean I'm gonna be getting busy for a while, so you might not be seeing too much of me. You're not missing Angela's birthday party.

Angela, daddy's got to go to work. Angela: Oh, dad! But I'll be home soon. Save me some cake. Fae: When they got here, she was completely submerged. These are the rocks he used to pin them down. Do you think one guy could do that? Who found them? That guy. He says he saw a fisherman with a truck. But he can't remember what he looked like, and he's pretty upset. Take some pictures. [ Camera shutter clicking ] So, he could... or they could be fishermen then. It's a popular place. You fish here? I used to live here for three and a half months. Where's the flash? I got in a fight with my father, and I decided I'm not gonna come home until he apologizes. What did you fight over? Money. Must have been a lot of money to keep you away for that long. It was a buck. That's the river. Yeah, he sends me for gas, I come home a buck short, and he starts to punch me. He starts punching me in the head until my mother hit him in the face with a frying pan. Ouch. Right? So, did he? Did he what? Apologize. No, but what he did do... we got another one. God!

I mean, this guy is socially inept, Dave. Can't even hold down a steady job. He has a violent criminal history, probably a record, and he wants you to catch him. How's that gonna happen? He's just gonna walk into our office? He might. I mean, I know these guys. It's all about the ego with them. That's how you're gonna trip him up. He's gonna get careless. He's gonna contact the task force with a suspect or a clue. Then he'll offer his help. He wants to meet you, buddy. Helen: Bad luck, fate, god not caring? The next night that my mom worked late, I looked up that poem again. "Out of the night that covers me, "black as the pit from pole to pole, "I thank whatever gods may be "for my unconquerable soul. "In the fell clutch of circumstance "I have not winced, nor cried aloud. "Under the bludgeonings of chance, my head is bloodied, but unbowed." I wish I believed it. Yeah, uh... I know who the green river killer is. The guy you're looking for is a cab driver, like myself. They call him crazy Joe. He's got a few girls working for him, and... Well, his policy is, if they don't cooperate, he beats the hell out of them. Mr. Dallas, has crazy Joe ever talked to you about the green river victims? No. No, he hasn't. But I know he's capable of doing something like this. I've seen his type before. Where is that? In prison. Denise: He used to pray before we had intercourse. Then he'd pray again after. Jeb was real religious when we first met. And when was that? Sometime in '77, spring. I wasn't his first wife. The first wife died. Kind of suspicious if I remember, but I didn't think nothing of it at the time. Got married in July, then I had to ask him to leave in August, 'cause he was kind of violent. What do you mean? Oh, he used to hit the TV and stuff. He tried to rape my daughter, but I don't want to get into that. I remember he had this shoe box... white shoe box full of clippings, newspaper articles, all about people dying. Hey. [ Clears throat ] Could you give me a lift? Man: Do you know who the green river killer is? Jeb: I told you last time I was here who it was. Did you know any of the victims? No, I did not. Did you kill Wendy coffield? No. Did you kill Cynthia hinds? No. Did you kill opal mills? This is ridiculous. No, I did not. Dave: Say, Jeb? You wouldn't mind if we searched your cab, would you? Now, why the hell would you want to do that for? [ Chuckles ] Look, go right ahead, huh? I got nothing to hide. I'm gonna open up this panel. Look under the rocker panel. Yeah, man, you never know. What do you got there? [ Camera shutter clicks ] There's something else under the seat there. Shift the seat forward, will you? How did you get a hold of the panties? They belonged to this girl, marcia. She left them there a couple of years ago. How come... was she wearing two pairs of panties? 'Cause we found two pairs of panties. The other pair belonged to a girl named Sandy. Sandy? What is this? I don't understand. What about the handcuffs? The handcuffs are just a pair of handcuffs, that's all. Do you know any of these women, hmm? What about her? Look, I know where you're going with this. Where am I going? And I want to make one thing clear here, okay? I ain't no killer, all right? I ain't no killer. But I did know a couple of these girls. Who'd you know, huh? I knew this girl here. Marsue haller... you knew her? Yeah. How do you know marsue? I think one night I picked her up on the strip, and I took her over to Steve's broiler, and I took her out to the airport once. Wow, specific. That's good. You got a really good memory, Jeb. Commended for that memory. It's very impressive. What can you remember about any of these other people? Take your time. A lot of time. Her? I knew this girl here. You knew Cindy hinds. How'd you know Cindy hinds? I gave her a ride somewhere. I can't remember where I picked... I just remember picking her up one night. Have sex with any of them? No, I did not. And that's it. I swear, that is it. Mm-hmm. You swear? Okay. So, why aren't you celebrating? Why? Well according to the news, you found the guy, right? Uh, no. See, the news is... Way off. See, there wasn't much evidence on the bodies that we found, so we have to physically tie him to one of the women, or we have to let him go. Oh, lord. Maybe there's someone, you know, someone who got away, some woman he tried to kill that got away that could identify him. Otherwise, we wait for another body. God willing, we'll find one. God willing? You had him! Why didn't you just arrest the sucker? Because we don't have enough evidence. Let me tell you what else you have. You have a list of 10 missing women, two of whom just turned up in Los Angeles very much alive. And you have all the city's newspapers, not to mention the mayor and the governor breathing down my neck because you don't do your damn job, detective! [ Door opens ] I did not take your damn disability check! Who cashed it? Somebody did. Don't you talk to him that way! I will talk to him however I want! 221 bucks! I did not raise you to act like this. You stole it, you little bitch! I'm not a bitch, you big, fat, ugly ass! Now you do not talk to him that way! He is the man of the house! You show him some respect! He's screwing me, mom, more than he's screwing you. Is that what you mean by respect? [ Breathing heavily ] Helen: So, how much does god will? Was it in his plan to have women die? [ Thunder rumbling ] [ Sobbing ] Or if he leaves these things up to us, why? We make lousy decisions. Why would god let this happen? By the time you ask that, it's too late. It's already over, so, why even think about it? Except sometimes you have to. Oh! The body's been identified as Laura meeks, age 17. She was first reported missing by her boyfriend two months ago, but she has been dead since late July, leading us to believe the killer does not dump all his victims in the river. Still, I want a list of every freshwater fishing license issued in the state of Washington. I want that list cross-checked with a list of all the men arrested for solicitating prostitution in the state over the last couple of years. I got the lab results on Jeb Dallas' hair. It is similar to hair found on one of the victims. Similar is not good enough. How about his blood? He is group "o" non-secretor. It's a match for the sperm found in opal mills... not an exclusive match. How about the men's socks tied around the neck of the latest victim? Can we trace that to anyone? Not yet, but we have a witness saying that Jeb Dallas named opal mills as a victim before her name was released to the public. How reliable? Look, Jeb Dallas fits the profile to a "t"... single, male, drinker, smoker. We need to stay on this, people. Let's go. Helen: So, my mom came home piss drunk the other night, 'cause her boyfriend took off on her. The grunt's gone? Yep. Took off in the middle of the night. Now she blames that on me. You're kidding. She said I better not even look at the next one, like I'm a rival or something. God, it's not like she has good taste in men. She's so desperate, she'll grab at anything. Hey, let's set her up on a blind date with someone who's fat and gay. [ Coughs ] She deserves that, yeah. Did I tell you that she tried to abort me? Really? That's what she said. She said I should be thankful that she didn't. Wow, what did you say? I said, "thankful for what, having you as a mother?" God, I didn't ask to be born. Far out. Must have fixed her. [ Chuckles ] What if I did, though? I mean... What if I was, like, a really bad person in a past life and I have to make up for it now, which is why this life's so crappy? You mean like you were Nixon or something? Yeah. Do you think that's true for everyone? Do you think what happens to us is our fault? God, I hope not. If it is, I must have been Jack the ripper. [ Camera shutter clicking ] [ Indistinct shouting ] Angela: Daddy? Yeah. Joey at school says these are bad women. He says his mom says you're wasting your time. Well... I'm sorry she feels that way. You know, my grandad, your great-grandfather... he was a minister. Actually, he wanted me to become a minister. I became a policeman, but he'd take me fishing, and we'd catch the little fish, and we'd throw them back. He'd say, "god doesn't throw the little ones back, "'cause they're helpless, so they need someone to look after them." Well, these women are helpless, so it's up to me to help god by stopping the bad guy who's hurting them. I have to do this, honey. I can't not do it. You tell Joey to mind his own beeswax.

The truck you spotted was blue, not green as you described. The owner's not Mexican or Indian, as you described. We talked to the guy. He's got nothing to hide. And then the janitor at the airport found her license. Seems she hopped a flight to Hawaii under a different name, and we got a tip she's working the streets in Honolulu. She wouldn't do this to me. Well, she just did. [ Telephone ringing ] Reichert. Yeah, patch it through to fae. Thank you. Helen: Everyone always asks, "why do bad things happen to good people?" What a stupid question. Why do they happen to them again and again? That's what I want to know. Come over here and get the footprints if you can. Helen: Why do they sometimes push good people over the edge? But then... ...whoever said life was fair? Seth: Chances are it's the same guy. Serial killers do occasionally change their m.O.'S. But the manner of this death, apart from the props, is similar to the others. Fish and wine have a last-supper connotation, the man you're looking for has deep religious issues. You a religious man, Dave? Yeah. Why? Well, I think he's trying to send you a message. I'm sorry. He's busy right now. Did you hear what the hell I just said?! Three white girls and three black girls were killed, that represents the Trinity. Sir, please lower your voice. Just give that to reichert and tell him to look at it. Dave: So, you remember Jeb Dallas, the guy who fit the FBI profile, well he shows up out of the blue, spouting biblical verses. Listen to this one. "If these things be true, "and the tokens of virginity be not found for the damsel, "then they shall bring out the damsel "to the door of her father's house, "and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she die." Meaning? Well... Meaning that explains rocks found inside them. You're bringing them home? Yeah, I just... I need a better filing system. Do you remember that chess game in college you tried to play with me, and you had no idea how to play, and I called you on it? I knew how to play. I said, "you can't do this," and you said, "there's no such thing as 'can't do.'" I know you believe that, Dave. I know you do your best to live your life by that, but sometimes... Sometimes a person needs to ask for help. I do ask for help. I pray every day. Not that kind of help, darling. Get a computer. [ Chuckles ] [ Indistinct conversation ] Helen: What was their life like before all this, before they hit the streets? Did they come from happy homes? Probably not. Did they run away or were they kicked out? Were they in trouble? Did they have boyfriends? Did they want husbands, kids? Heck, most of them were kids. Dave: Green river task force. Detective reichert. No, we do not have anyone in custody at this time, ma'am. I'm sure that's true, ma'am. But if your niece is missing for more than 72 hours... yes, ma'am, I have a daughter of my own. Detective reichert? Yeah. Hold on one second. I'm Greta. The green river killer tried to kill me. His name's Joe Jakes. He's a cab driver. The guy you're looking for is a cab driver, just like me. His girlfriend was Laura meeks. You found her body last September. He picked me up, and he tried to choke me when I wouldn't let him do what he wanted. Which was what? Put things inside me. What are you doing?! Aah! Aah! Get his hand! Get his hand! Come on! Just tell me what's going on! No! No! You sons of... [ car door closes ] Is that what this is about? You believe her? She's a drunk. Just answer the questions, please. Did you kill Laura meeks?

Well, I love you, girl. I love you, girl, forever. Is love fate or choice? We always think it's fate until it turns sour. [ Telephone ringing ] Dave: Reichert. All right. I'll be right there. Helen: But maybe our mistakes are fate, too and not just bad choices, and we end up hating ourselves for something that we had no control over. All right, let's set up the grid. Set up the grid. I want the entire site combed for evidence. See anything suspicious, photograph it, bag it, tag it. Do not contaminate it. Let's go.

Because according to Dave, we don't have evidence that'll stand up in court. Looks like Dave needs a little help. We are now officially the enhanced green river task force. Dave's still in charge, but from now on, anything that goes through Dave, I want to see. We're gonna be re-interviewing all our old leads. We're not gonna do that. No, that's... sit down, Dave. We got plenty of stuff to work on right now. We need to be moving forward, not moving backward. Sit down. Why? We need to be moving forward. Sit down! Don't you dare embarrass me in an open meeting ever again. All I am saying is it's better to move forward than backward. 15 women are dead, and other than Jeb Dallas and Joe Jakes, we have no other major suspects. That is because we're seriously undermanned. You are the leader of this task force, Dave. What you say these guys take as gospel, but if you have problems with what I say, you come to me in private, because if you don't, I will transfer you, reichert.

All we have is that single line. That's it? It's the sum total of what we have, and that's not even admissible. [ Sighs ] It's better than nothing. That doesn't feel right. Julie? Julie?! [ Telephone ringing ] Yeah. I have a place I want to take you. I'm gonna take you there, and I'm gonna tie you up, and you can scream. You can scream forever, and no one can hear you. What's your name? [ Dial tone ] Dave, what's wrong? It's, uh... Man: King county police. This is detective reichert. I want a patrol car outside my house immediately. I also want another car taking my kids to school every day from now on. You got that? You got that?! Yes, sir, right. Are you okay? Yes, yes. It's... it's fine. You sure? Yeah. [ Siren wailing in distance ] Bobby: So, who's nat? Hmm? The little guy here. Hmm, she's my girlfriend. What do you mean, your girlfriend? Not that kind of girlfriend. [ Chuckles ] You know, 'cause there's always room for three here. No, not that kind of girlfriend. She's like, um... Like a buddy. Do you have any buddies? No, not anymore. Not since I was 10. No, that's not true, I'll take that back. I do have one buddy. He's a very, very friendly guy. No, I don't do that. Do you really do that? Makes me happy. He's a very friendly guy. You ought to introduce yourself. [ Sniffing ] No thanks. How old are you? 18. So, you're an adult, right? I mean, you shouldn't meet this guy when you're a kid, 'cause you have no control. But when you're an adult, you have a choice. You can say yes or no. You can shake his hand one day and walk away the next. I don't make love to little girls, you know. I make love to women. ♪ But there's only one action ♪ ♪ There's only one guy ♪ ♪ Who can bring satisfaction ♪ [ Both laugh ] "One... "Black in the river. Had a... had a stone in the vagina." That's never been made public. I know. "He had sex after they're dead." Mmm. Says he's a cop. What line? 16. "Out-of... out-of-state cop." Get this overnighted to Quantico. Get the FBI on it. All right. Seth: The author of the letter has no connections with the green river homicides, 'cause the man who wrote this is making a feeble and amateurish attempt to gain some personal importance by manipulating the investigation. Dave: Well, how'd he get the information? Rumors or hearsay, right? There's lots of misinformation in there too, right? I don't know. Dave, Dave, Dave! I know this guy, okay? Better than anybody, because that's my job, right? Now, your job is tracking down the clues. How's it going? Well, we're interviewing, polygraphing a number of suspects. Some for a second and third time. And how's that going for you? You see my point, Dave? You may be the best detective in Seattle, but this is the big leagues, all right? Watch and learn. Let's go! [ Sniffing ] Okay, go ahead. Don't! Don't! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Don't! I don't like that. I'm sorry. Go, go, go. Don't... move your hand. Stop it! I'm not touching you. [ Laughing ] Dave: Steady. Success. [ Telephone ringing ] Sleeping beauty's castle. No, it's a spaceship. I don't think it can fly, Daniel. Sure, it can. Helen: When I was in the seventh grade, I wrote a poem and buried it beneath the tree in my old backyard. Julie: Hello? I wonder, if I dug it up, would it be as good as I remember? Probably not. Nothing ever is. Dave, it's the office. [ Camera shutter clicks ] God. He put that inside her? This whole... this whole area. Dave? All right, the river's about 30 yards, south, southwest. The bodies were discovered 30 feet apart from each other. [ Panting ] [ Indistinct shouting ] [ Thunder rumbling ] What do you got? We haven't started on this one yet, but take a look at this. We found another body over here. It appears to be female. Female... both? Yeah, both female. God. No, no, don't touch me. ♪ You are an obsession, you're my obsession ♪ ♪ Who do you want me to be to make you sleep with me ♪ Hi. Hi. Did you get it? Yeah. But I don't have any money to pay for it. Okay, we'll get it later. I tried, but, um... He said he'd do it for free for a favor. He likes you. What? What? Bobby, no. Just this once, okay? No, Bobby, that's not fair. I know, but I've been busting my ass for you all these months. Just this once, okay? I know it won't mean anything to you. I know you'll be thinking of me. Okay? Just this one time. ♪ Who do you want me to be to make you sleep with me? ♪ Okay. There he is. Dave, you know Seth imperia from FBI. Seth. Dave, how you doing? Good. How's the case going? It's going. The task force over the weekend received a letter offering us help in identifying the killer. Seth here has come to give us some advice on what to do about it. What makes you think this letter isn't a hoax? 'Cause I know it's not. The letter's from a man who claims he has expertise in this area, says he can't go into any personal detail, but he says he knows how the mind of a serial killer works, and I'm inclined to believe him. Why is that? He's on death row in Florida, Dave. His name is Ted Bundy. [ Buzzer buzzing ] Hi, Ted. I'm Seth. This is Dave. Hi. Have a seat. Hope I can help. Let me begin by saying that I have intuitions based on... Based on feelings. I'll tell you this about the green river man... violent death is indispensable to his fantasies. What's he like? Low-key. He may be single. He may be married. When you get too much into the profiles, you lose something. The girls on the strip disappeared because he didn't fit the profile. He doesn't seem like a killer, so they trust him. Maybe he's offering them employment or... Money or drugs. Maybe he says he's a cop. But in the end... It's all about the hunt. He loves to hunt. It's all about the killing. It's like a hobby. How do we catch him? Next time you find a fresh body, stake it out. He'll be back. He wants to have sex with the dead. He wants that feeling of power and ownership... Physical possession. You look troubled. Am I boring you? You see, some people... they think that serial killers want to be caught, like they have a little voice inside telling them what they're doing is wrong. Don't believe it. He's loving this. It's personal. And I can tell by looking at you, Dave, it's personal for you, too. [ Chuckles ] Yeah. Eleanor: His face looked cold. He put me in a choke hold, but I scratched his forearm, and I got away. He couldn't catch me, 'cause his pants were down around his ankles. I seen him. Who's that? The killer... the guy who took my girlfriend. Your girlfriend? Judy hemmerly. I seen him when he took her. Judy hemm... that was over two years ago. So? I been down in San Diego. I didn't know she was dead. Have a seat. This man is not considered a suspect in the death of Judy hemmerly. Hey, I know him. He looks like the guy that picked me up right before I met you. Really? Please call the task-force hotline at 555-8965. And now for a wrcb editorial in this case, our station manager, Lynn mosey. Lynn? Lynn: Thank you, ed. There are now 29 women dead, and 13 are still missing in king county. The inept detectives on the green river task force are now being pressured by politicians and the public to call in the FBI. Where's the patrol car? I sent it away. Why? Dave. You realize if you sent the patrol car away, then we don't have any... it was threat, okay? Nothing's happened for nine months. Because we're protected. Because he's not coming after us. He just wanted to scare you just like you scared him. Sweetheart, do you understand we can't take... we have to live our lives, Dave! We live in a safe universe. I have to believe that. And I have to believe that god is watching over us. What do you believe? Do you know anymore? Do you know? And it was the construction guys that found the body. Right. And what did they find exactly? Well besides a skull, the construction crew found a femur and a pelvis over there. And that's it? Well, that's it over there. But over here, we found a complete skeleton. Making two bodies. Well, one and a half, really. One and a half, right. The skull seems to have had some medical procedure done, which matches one of your missing women. Yeah. Yeah, Denise bush. Good work. Yeah, she had a shunt put in her brain when she was a kid. Do you think the killer's moving down here to Oregon? Well, we're not certain, detective, but it certainly complicates our investigation, crossing state lines and bringing the feds in it for sure. Denise bush disappeared in '82. You were still working Seattle then. We should try and find the rest of those bones. I agree. Helen: So, what happens is this... you're cruising along, high on whatever blinds you, and you wake up one day, and you suddenly see the truth. Life is crap, and there's nothing you can do about it. You see someone happier, and you just want to bring them down... ...which is what I did. Oh, my god! Hel! Oh, my god! [ Both squealing ] Where have you been? Your mom said you went back east to live with your dad. That's a lie. She's such a liar. So, where you been then? Just hanging out, going up and down the coast. Bobby and I like to stay ahead of the game. Bobby? [ Chuckles ] Yeah, that's my guy. What about you? I'm between guys right now. That's okay, though. I'm getting my g.E.D., and I'm, like, totally broke so... Hey, you know any ways of making money that are fast and legal? Almost legal. What? You wouldn't do it. How do you know? Just forget about it. What? Turning fake tricks. What? No way, man. I don't do that crap. It's fake, nat. It's not real, and it's so easy. I promise you, it's totally safe. What do you mean, it's fake? You don't do anything. You just fork out a price, but he has to pay you half in advance. Once you get the money, you tell him you're underage, then you split. But I'm 19. Nat, he doesn't know that. You could make 100 bucks an hour. It's stupid. I'm not crazy. No, you're chicken. Bawk! You're chicken. Because of the bodies found across state lines in Oregon and because of public and private expressions of concern, the FBI has assigned several agents to the case to help apprehend this killer. [ Applause ] You can do it! What are you doing? Come on. Turn. Go! Good girl. We now have 55 investigators on the enhanced green river task force. [ Applause ] Get in. Now just get the money and get out. We've covered a lot of territory in tracking this man down and are now closer than ever to identifying him. Get out! Get... nat! What are you... nat! [ Applause ] I have a sneaking suspicion that in the coming year, the green river killer will be caught. [ Applause ] Hey, Helen! Can I give you a lift? Hey, girl, haven't seen you in a while. How you been? Is nat here? Yeah, she's in her room. She got in late. Nat? Oh, my god, are you okay? Did he hurt you? I said, "get out of the truck." What happened? Nothing. What do you mean, nothing? Did you get any money? Was it the green river killer? It doesn't matter. Well, you'll never guess who picked me up last night. The grunt. He's found god. He's turned into this religious nut, you know, he's falling all over himself just apologizing for what he used to do to me. All the while, his hand is on my thigh... go away, hel! I don't want to see you again for a while, okay? Excuse me. I'm looking for detective reichert. Thank you. [ Sighs ] Um, detective reichert? Mm-hmm? The man at the desk said that I should talk to you. You saw the truck. Yeah, um... It was grey and... Had one of those things on the back of it. Like a canopy? Yeah. Did you get a license number? No, it was too far away. Your friend... would she talk to me? I don't think so. Tell you what... why don't you write down her address and I'll go see her? You okay? I mean, do you want a... are you thirsty? Do you want a drink or coffee or something? No, I'm okay. Man: Excuse me, Dave. I'm wondering if you could give me a hand with this. Can you just give me a second? Thank you. Helen... ...be careful. I'll be okay. Thanks. This word here... it's, um, "ry-gor"... lividity, what is that? Lividity... it has to do with the blood settling in the body. When it becomes fixed, rigor mortis sets in. Didn't they teach you anything at Quantico? Well, they taught us how to catch him. Really? Name's greenwalt. He cuts the heads off neighbor's dogs when they bother him. He's a trapper, so he knows the area like the back of his hand. He knows the river. He knows the dump sites. Fit the profile perfect. Yeah, I know, he certainly does. It's a wonder I've never heard of him. You will. We just picked him up. The first words out of his mouth... what took you so long? [ Chuckles ] Hi, Natalie webley? I'm detective reichert. Um, I want to ask you a question. You have a friend, Helen Remus. She said that you had an encounter with the green river killer. Is that true? I don't want to talk about it. You don't want to talk about it. Why not? 'Cause nothing happened. Well, that's good. Did this guy happen to give you a name? Joe something. Joe Jakes? [ Cheering ] Got to hand it to them... at least they're confident. [ Indistinct conversations ] Yeah! Yeah! Hey, can I have your attention for a minute please? A couple of things. First, Albert greenwalt has just been cleared through hair and blood samples. He has, in the meantime, filed a lawsuit against the county for false arrest, and the result is that the king county council, in order to cut costs, is reducing the task force from 55 to 47. [ Murmuring ] Joe Jakes, whom we polygraphed as a potential suspect, hung himself, surrounded by photos of nude women. I am now convinced, gentlemen and ladies, that he was the green river killer. Again, no proof. Well, then we have to find it. As you know, our new computer system will soon be up and running, and that'll be a big help. I've hired 20 data-entry people to input all our tips and information. Now, fae, I'm putting you in charge of overseeing any lists we might need... prostitute assaults, tips on trucks and jeeps, potential dump sites. Got that?

[ Horn honking ] So, I did something about it. Hi. How are you? Not bad. How you doing? What's your name? Hel. You like to party? Huh? Hey! Hey! Where you going? Hey! Hey! Stop! Stop! [ Horn honking ] What are you doing?! Can you follow that truck? Thanks. I think it's the green river killer. "Beyond this place of wrath and tears "looms but the horror of the shade.

What if Bundy's right? What if Bundy's right and this guy is married, or he has children, or he's employed? The perp was Joe Jakes and he killed himself. All right, it's over, Dave. Maybe not. I just don't think so. In my gut, I feel like... you can't trust your gut! Okay, listen. Listen to what I'm saying, Seth. If Bundy was right, okay, and this guy doesn't want to get caught... say the guy does not want to get caught... you're an amateur! You don't know what you're talking about. You're an amateur who's wasting my time! Fine. [ Dial tone ] [ Tires screeching ] Helen: Okay, I said to follow the truck, and he turned left. What are you doing? Man: Relax. Hey, just wait a second. [ Guns clicking ] Hey, you want to help me build a fort? My mom says I have to stay here. It's just over there. It won't take long. What's your name? You can call me bowie. You know who he is, don't you? Unh-unh. He invented the knife. This is a good spot. Are we gonna build it here? Your mom was right, you know. What about? About worrying. There's people around here that like to kill little boys like you. I always wanted to know what it felt like. [ Siren wailing ] Man: How much? $100. For what? Whatever you want. Helen: How much control do we have over our lives? That's what it comes down to. He's cute. Is he yours? Yeah. Of the choices we make, how many are choices? Bet I know who this is. Woman: How old are you?! 13?! You're still peeing yourself! You should be ashamed! What are your friends gonna say when they hear about this, huh? You belong in an institution for the retarded! You're gonna turn into your father... and ends up sleeping with whores. Do your hands. They're trash. If it was illegal aliens, you could take them to the border and fly them back out of here. You're just as cute as your little boy. Man: Still am. Come on inside. Let's just do it in here. No, no, no. Come on. [ Gasps ] [ Coughing ] Man: Um, it's taped off down, I think, about 20 yards. Five years is just too long. You need a break, Dave. God knows we all do, but you more than anyone. "You're absolutely right, fae, and thank you for your concern." If she could talk... If for 5 minutes she could come back and answer our questions. Which would be what? What other than "who done it?" Why? Why did you go out with this guy? How did he win your trust? How did it happen? And how did god let it happen? When did Joe Jakes kill himself? February of '86. This receipt is from April of '86... ...which means Joe Jakes is not our guy. Our guy's still working. She's talking to you, Dave. How about we start with a comparison list of all the Johns arrested for solicitation, prostitution, with all the pickup-truck owners? I'm on it. Mrs. Remus: Yeah? Hi, Mrs. Remus. I'm nat, hel's friend. Yeah, I remember. I haven't seen you in a while. What's up? Um, I finished my g.E.D. I'm doing nails downtown at the market. I'm getting married in the spring. Yeah? Good for you. I was wondering, have you seen hel? She was working the strip last I heard. Maybe you ought to check down there. She ever call? She's got her own life now. Okay. Thanks. If you hear from her, will you just tell her that I asked about her? Dave: Sir, I've gone through these old files. There's someone I'd like to investigate further. His name's Gary ridgway. He turned up on both the lists I requested... owns a pickup truck, was arrested on John patrol, may of 1982, admits he dates prostitutes, admits he knew some of the women who were killed. Forget it, Dave. We know it was Joe Jakes. We don't know that. He killed himself... the murders stopped. What if they haven't? The last body we found died after Jakes killed himself. I just don't think we can stop until we have proof, and I don't think the newspapers would want it any differently. Ridgway... why is this name familiar? We talked to him in '83. He passed the polygraph in '84... he passed? ...which we know from Jeb Dallas we can't always trust. Look, I just... I just think we should take another look at this guy. [ Sighs ] What do you need? Search his house, search his pickup truck, search his locker at work, get samples of hair and saliva, and put him under surveillance. Okay. You better be right. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! What's going on here? What's the trouble? What's going on? This is my truck. No trouble, Mr. Ridgway. I have a warrant to search your truck. King county police. Dave: Nothing. Norwell: I'm sorry. Say that again. We found nothing. Nothing to connect him with any of these crimes? No. Nothing in his house? Nothing at work? No. Do you know what this makes us look like? In front of his co-workers and neighbors, that man was humiliated. We can't afford another lawsuit, and we may have one. He's hired a lawyer. Just we... I thought we were getting close. I'll tell you how close we are. The "Seattle times" got wind of this. I got a call from a reporter this morning. It was all I could do to beg him to keep that man's name out of the paper. They're running a 6-part series about the green river murders, and about how we as a task force and a police department, have totally failed. We're close, detective reichert, to becoming a punch line to any number of unfunny jokes. You followed your gut, okay. Every detective on this task force has his own gut feelings about who's behind this. Let me tell you what my gut says, and my gut is backed by evidence. Nothing you have shown me so far connects the last body found to the green river killer. There are prostitute murders down in San Diego. Maybe he's there. There are prostitute murders in Vancouver. He could be up there. But there have been no women killed for over 3 years in the Seattle-Tacoma area that fit his m.O., and there have been no women reported missing that fit his victim profile. Maybe he changed his m.O.

We'll have a celebrity host. We'll re-enact some of the crimes. Why will this make a difference? Because it works. I've talked to these producers. They've already solved over 200,000 felonies worldwide. When in doubt, turn to Hollywood. That's right, that's right. Whatever it takes, because somewhere out there, there is someone who knows who this killer is, who is afraid to come talk to you. Now, whether it's the money that's gonna make a difference, whether it's some kind of publicity, whether it's a matter of dumb luck, I don't care! Because we are gonna find this guy, or I swear to god... Let's get on it. Let's go. Dave: I have been working on this case for over 6 years now, and I feel confident that soon someone will lead us to you. And when that happens, when we get that information, no one will care about you or your problems. They will only want to see you punished. Many investigators believe that you are enjoying these killings, but several of us believe that you... you're haunted by them, that this is a nightmare for you, this whole experience has been a nightmare for you and that you would like this nightmare to stop, but it won't stop, and that is why you must contact us. And you must contact us before someone calls us and leads us to you, because if we identify you first, no one will care what you think or feel. It will be too late. So, please call me, because it's time for us to talk. [ Thunder rumbling ] Honey? Honey, is something wrong? It's freezing out here. You should be in bed. I've been thinking about dad. What about him? Yes, he is. But I'm not, mom. I don't want the killer to come get us. Come here. Mmm. I love you. It's okay. Come on. Oh, you're freezing. Oh, get you inside. [ Dial tone ] Woman: Operator. Man: Yeah, I'm looking for the home phone of a David reichert. [ Telephone ringing ] Hello. Hello? [ Dial tone ] This was such a bad idea. We've had Jeb Dallas in our sights for 2 1/2 years. Why don't we just pick him up? What are we going to pick him up on? On what evidence are you gonna pick him up? Gentlemen, ladies, we got 17,000 pages of tip sheets to review. Hello! This whole "manhunt" thing is bull! It's never gonna work! You're just an idiot, Dave! You're incompetent! [ Indistinct shouting ] Hey, you're out of line, detective! Take a walk, Dave! Detective Brooks, get him out of here now. Everybody just calm down, all right? Woman: Let's get back to work, okay? Hel: I'd like to report a missing person. She's not a relative? She's a friend. Her mother's alive, but they aren't speaking. She's been gone since the spring of '87. It's over a year and a half. Why did you wait this long to report her? We weren't speaking, either. She, um... she was a prostitute. I think she was a victim of the green river killer. The green river killer gets blamed for everything around here. She hasn't moved some place else? Those girls move around. I don't know. Maybe. Look, she's probably still out there. She'll turn up. In the meantime, we'll see what we can do. I never thought about the dead being just as lost as I was... not in heaven or hell, but in a different place, where all they do is try to figure stuff out... life and death, the reasons why. But now I know. 'Cause now... I'm one of them. Got a few calls that might lead somewhere. That's a start. I did speak to one girl that knew more than what we've released. It's not bad from 7,600 calls in two hours. Out of 80,000 attempts? We were understaffed. You really want to track down 80,000 tips? All it takes is one. I'll track that one. You do the rest. [ Chuckles ] Will do. Good night. Good night. [ Sighs ] [ Engine turns over ] Woman: At 7:06 A.M. eastern time, 4:06 Seattle time, today, January 24th, 1989, Ted Bundy was executed in the electric chair at the Florida state prison in stark, Florida. His last words were, "I'd like you to give my love to my family and friends." Man: ...Great number that took place in and around the Seattle-Tacoma region remain unsolved. Maybe he tells them that he's a cop. Norwell: What's this? This is a guy named Everett halloway. We got a tip on him from the "manhunt" broadcast. I was going over the green river letter last night. I was trying to figure out what information was accurate, what was misinformation. I came across the line "out-of-state cop"... something about out of state. Anyway, I checked the "manhunt" tip sheets. It turns out we did get a call from this lady down in Oregon, who said this guy dressed as a cop took her down to his basement and made dirty movies of her. Police! Police! We have a warrant! Check downstairs! Clear! Going up! Police! Anything? Nothing! Clear! Dave: Anyway, she said his name was halloway, so I looked him up. This guy was an m.P. In the military. He got a doctorate in psychology, and in 1979, he broke into a uniform shop and stole some police paraphernalia. Two years later, he walked off a prison work program and disappeared. That was right before the murders began. He currently lives outside of Portland, close to where Denise bush's skull was found. So, anyway, she I.D.'S him from the mug shot, and she says all this guy wants to talk about is how much he hates prostitutes... ...get this... how the green river killer kills all his victims in snuff films. Dave, I love you. You know that. I don't think it's possible for people to love each other anymore. I do. Helen: The name's hel. Does that turn you on? 'Cause I'm gonna turn you on. I want to make you happy. [ Chuckles ] I want to do whatever it is that you want me to do. What do you want to do? What's your fantasy? You want to tie me up? You can do that. You want to do something terrible to me... ...something that just might get you in... man: Go on, hel. Don't stop now. How do you want to make me happy? [ Voice breaking ] I don't. [ Crying ] I... I want to make me happy. But I don't know how. Have you ever seen that cartoon "Alice in wonderland"? Well, I feel like I've fallen in that hole and no matter how hard I try, I can't get out. And I do try. I try really hard. But the thing is... ...i don't believe anymore. I don't believe that there is anything better than this. I don't believe that there is anyone who loves me, or wants to help me. [ Sobbing ] Not even god! I think god hates me, and I don't know why. Please, let me go. Please, just let me go. I don't want to be in here. Please, just let me go. Help me. [ Sobbing quietly ] How old were the tapes? How'd you get those women to do that? Let's back up, shall we? You pose as a police officer. Then what? They came of their own free will. Why are they tied up? The bonds were loose. Why were some crying? They're faking it. How many died? None. None died? None died. Did you see any die? Did you watch all the tapes? Did you like what you saw? Did you enjoy your little investigation? How many victims of the green river killer were in my movies? At least one. Who? Her name is Helen Remus. Never heard of her. She's on your tapes. She's not a green river victim. She's missing. Doesn't mean she's dead. Did you find her body? No. Of course not. I know their names backwards and forwards. There is no Helen Remus. [ Chuckles ] We've got you, Everett. Do you understand that? We've got you. Look around you. You're not going anywhere. You know where you're going? Jail. What do you think is gonna happen in jail when those boys find out what kind of stuff... I didn't kill those women. If I did, I wouldn't be here. Look at Bundy. He was phenomenal. You guys still don't know how many women he killed. But in the end, he was stupid. He made mistakes. If I had done this, I wouldn't make mistakes. But I'm here. Therefore, I didn't do it. Once again, you've arrested an innocent man. Yeah, you're here, Everett. I think your logic's a little flawed. It's like fingerprints, only better. They're still working on it. I did some research. They haven't perfected it yet, but DNA's the coming thing. So, you think we can match halloway to some of the victims? We can only hope. Helen: When I was a kid, I used to wonder if the dead ever talked to the living. What would they say? I figured they'd try to help us, like tell us to buy this lottery ticket, or not to go out with that guy. Do you think he killed all of them? Um, a good many of them, yeah. Why? [ Sighs ] I don't know, sweetheart. Why would god let this happen? Well... Well, god gives people free will, they get to make choices. The guy who did this made a terrible choice. Do you think god is punishing them? [ Sighs ] No, I don't think it works that way. It's not their fault what happened. But didn't they choose to live like that? Yeah, but that doesn't give anyone the right to hurt them. So, why doesn't god help you find him, so more women don't die? You might think... About becoming a lawyer, honey, because you ask some really tough questions. Fae: Hey! Hey, what's up? I just got a call from the DNA lab. Everything we sent them... totally useless. Unbelievable. Are you kidding me? The tests aren't advanced enough to compare anything but blood types. So, halloway matches, but so do a hundred other suspects, and the lab had to destroy most of the samples in order to get this far. [ Scoffs ] So, halloway walks? [ Buzzer buzzing ] Woman: In another stunning setback for the king country green river task force, king county police have released former marine Everett halloway, who was arrested last month in connection with the murders of 39 women. Lack of progress has plagued the task force for several years, and protestors have decried the misuse of king county taxes on a case that has gone unsolved since 1982. It is generally believed that the green river killer has stopped killing, moved elsewhere, or died. In other events... I didn't believe that anyone wanted to help me. That's what I thought. But I was wrong. [ Siren wailing in distance ] Excuse me, ladies. Do you recognize this lady at all? No. Hmn-hmn. No? Okay. Excuse me. Do you recognize this woman? Sorry. You sure? Mm-hmm. Okay, thank you. Helen: So, you have to believe, even if you're mistaken, even if there truly is no one who gives a damn about you, 'cause what's the point in thinking that? To be right? Why not believe in Santa, even if it's a lie? If it makes you happy, who's it gonna hurt? So what if you look like an idiot. You got to hope. Even if hope is a lie. The "manhunt" program so far has produced only one viable lead. We have decided, therefore, due to budget restraints, to reduce the task force to two full-time detectives, detective Dave reichert and detective fae Brooks. How are you gonna catch the killer? [ Indistinct shouting ] Heading home? Angela's going out on her first date tonight. Congratulations. She was 9 when this started. How long you been driving? Um, about 6 months. Any traffic violations I should know of? No sir. What movie you gonna go see? I thought I'd let Angela decide that. No r-rated films. No sir. Are you coming straight home? Daddy, if you're gonna go through his entire criminal history, we're gonna be late. What? What criminal history? Come on, Trent. I'll be back by 11:30. I'll bring her home right after the movie, I promise. Helen: All of us here... we still hope. Like once I met this girl... Ted Bundy did her... and she's not like me. She was in college. She came from a nice family. She never saw it coming. But if she had seen it coming or someone in her family had and there was no way to stop it, wouldn't that have been worse? I mean, if the choice is between fate and hope... It's only 10:45. The movie's probably just letting out. I'm not worried. ...well, hope lets you breathe a little easier. Trent: See you later. Good night. Have a good time? Yeah. Did you? Well, I've been working all night. I just came out 5 minutes ago to have a little break. What movie did you see? Um, we didn't. We went to lake sammamish, and we talked. You talked? Yeah. And guess what I found out? What? He's not the green river killer. Angel, I never thought that he... you live in a different world than I do, daddy. You see horrible things every day. Well, horrible things happen. But they don't have to happen, and most of the time, they don't. Well, that's true, but it doesn't mean they're not going to happen. When you were a kid, horrible things never happened to you. You were never even mugged or attacked. I was. It was a long time ago. I was not much older than your brother. [ Grunting ] I got away. Help me! But who knows what he would have done if I hadn't. Ever since then, I've dedicated my life to stopping people like him... people who prey on innocent... others. And they're out there, sweetheart. Nobody ever expects to meet them, and then it's too late. Thank you, daddy, for keeping me safe. [ Crying ] I don't believe that there is anyone who loves me or wants to help me. Not even god! [ Sobbing ] I think god hates me. And I don't know why. Help me. Dave: But it's never enough. Helen: You picked up the phone. You caught the case, answering the phone that first time, all because some guy tried to slit your throat. So, was that bad luck? I don't believe in luck. Okay. But in high school, you lived for 3 1/2 months overlooking the green river. That must have been fate. I don't believe in fate. Then what do you believe in, Dave? But I do believe in god. And you think that this was part of god's plan? Helen: You think that god would let you let us down? He put me in a choke hold, but I scratched his forearm and got away. Gotcha. [ Phone ringing ] Yeah? Fae: We got another one. Can you just pull that back, will you? What is it? It's a shunt. It's a brain shunt. See? Find the skull yet? Not so far. No, because he moved it. What? The skull... he moved the skull. It turned up a couple of years ago down in Oregon by halloway's place. The skull seems to have had some medical procedure done. You see, he killed her here. After she was decomposed, he takes the skull, he takes some bones, he plants himself in Portland. Why? Because he wants us to think he's not working here anymore. But I know better, because I know who he is. Okay, what, what do you mean you... you got him because of a shunt? No, because of a little piece of the puzzle that I found a couple of days ago that I overlooked. So, what are you saying? You got halloway? I got the green river killer, yeah. Now we just have to catch him. [ Horn honks ] Excuse me, girls. Um, do you recognize this girl? No. No? Okay. Thank you. Man: Are you dating? Um, no, but I need your help. Do you recognize her? Give it here. I always thought there could be a woman who got away, you know, one woman who managed to get away. There was, and she came and talked to you. He put me in a choke hold, but I scratched his forearm and got away. But she I.D.'D him, though. And so, two days ago, I checked out his work records, his vehicle registrations. It turns out this guy is available for every single one of the murders, and he's had a good number of pickup trucks. The trucks didn't always match the eyewitnesses description, but he had a brother who had some that did. Are you telling me it's Jeb Dallas? No, see, it's not Jeb Dallas. That's the thing. Jeb Dallas fits the profile, this guy doesn't fit the profile. So, then who is it, Dave? Come on. Just stop fooling with me. Tell me. It's Gary ridgway. [ Engine turns over ] You know, she does look kind of familiar. Is she your sister? Practically. Come on inside. It's miserable out there. Come on inside. Come on. I'm not gonna bite you. Come on. Here, here's a towel. Just wipe yourself off. Come on. And roll up that window. It's soaking over here. Thanks. Yeah, I do remember her. I remember real well. Gary ridgway? Yeah, and it was Ted Bundy that gave me the clue. When you get too much into the profile, you lose something. Girls on the strip disappeared because he didn't fit the profile. They trusted him. We trusted him. In the last 48 hours, I've tracked down everything I could find on the guy. I visited kenworth motor, where he worked. I couldn't believe it. It was the exact same building my dad worked when I was a kid. Coincidence? Maybe. Then I found his ex. In 1973, me and Gary hooked up. Man, he was wild. He'd take me for picnics in the woods. He loved the woods. He was a blast. Judge not that ye be not judged. Gladys: Then after our son was born, he found god, got very religious. You're seeing prostitutes. Yeah, yeah, yeah, so? Big deal. So, who doesn't see prostitutes? You're picking up whores, you bastard! Then he started going out in the evenings for long periods of time. He'd come home dirty or soaking wet and never say what he'd been doing. When I divorced him, god went out the window. He didn't want another divorce... didn't want to be thought of as a loser, which he was. [ Indistinct chatter on police radio ] Dave: Gary made his first big mistake in '82. He was arrested for solicitation. After that, he took women elsewhere, and that's when he started killing. A year later, he was nearly caught. Excuse me. Hi. You the owner of the blue pickup? Yeah. Mind if we ask you a few questions? No, not at all. I remember him rolling down his sleeves. I remember at the time I just thought it was nothing. I didn't think it was important. And then I was going through the tip sheets and came across your interview with Eleanor. But I scratched his forearm and got away. So, I pulled his medical records. And Gary claims he had some kind of accident... spilled battery acid on his arm. He got scared... had his so-called accident after we showed up in order to cover up the scratches. [ Muffled screams ] We all made mistakes. We all made assumptions. Seth: The author of the letter has no connections with the green river homicides. We were looking for a smoker. We were looking for a drinker. We were looking for a big guy, someone that looked strong enough to hold the bodies down in the river while he covered them with rocks. We were looking for a loner, someone who hadn't married, who didn't have kids. We were looking for a drifter, someone who couldn't hold down a steady job. Gary was none of these. Gary held a job for 30 years. He had a perfect attendance record. He had an active social life. He remarried. He didn't match the profile at all. I'm not used to a man wanting me. I'm not used to a woman wanting me. And believe me, I've known a few. He called my home the night of the broadcast. Dave: So, please call me, because it's time for us to talk. Yeah, I'm looking for the home phone of a David reichert. I think he lives in renton. Operator: Just a moment please. That number is 555-9083. Thank you. [ Telephone ringing ] [ Telephone ringing ] Hello. Hello? Gotcha. None of it's proof. We need proof, fae. We need evidence. We need hard evidence. I can't stop him until I can tie him to a body. What's her name again? Um, Helen. Hel for short. Right, yeah, yeah, yeah. Helen; So, here's what I figured out. I used to think that god didn't exist or care. I mean 'cause if he did, he doesn't know what he's doing. It's all up to us. But the more I think about it, the more I've come to believe there really is a plan... the stuff that turns our lives around. It's almost like it's meant to be, like me meeting nat or Dave, like me meeting Gary. No, I think I was mistaken. Get out of here. Go on. Get out of here! [ Engine turns over ] Maybe it is fate after all, with a little bit of choice mixed in. Dave? What? Bad news. What's going on? We're tossing it, Dave. What? It's taking up too much space. You're not taking this stuff. Most of this is either circumstantial or irrelevant. This is what we need to tie a body to Gary ridgway. Gary ridgway? That's right. You tried that once before. Remember? Hey, nothing in those freezers. Leave those right there. There's not a chance in hell they can do anything with it. You know what? You keep your damn evidence, but you're not gonna be around to play with it, because you're off the task force, Dave. What? Yeah, you've been promoted. Not my choice, but I guess they're short on mule-headed troublemakers, or maybe they just want you out of here. Either way, fae's the only one left. You got my job now, detective. Enjoy it. Come on, fellas. Captain! Captain! It's over, Dave. Helen: Still, with fate or without it, life moves on. The bodies they find in the late '80s and '90s are so decomposed, they can't even say what killed them, so the victim list doesn't grow, and a lot of the cases just get filed and forgotten. Except Dave. I did a vaginal swab, found traces of semen. Polymerase chain-reaction short-tandem repeats, which in English means they can construct entire chains of DNA from a very small amount of evidence. How small? A single pubic hair, a single drop of sperm, they can try. The catch is they have to destroy the evidence in order to get results. It's a gamble. Well worth taking. So, how do I spend my time waiting? I think of things that would have made a difference to me. Hi, Wallace. Hey, hel. Beautiful day. A nicer, kinder grunt. [ Sighs ] A father who stuck around for me. Trouble is, I can't remember what he looked like. Most of the time, I just hang around with the others, biding our time until something happens. Till someone sets us free. Dave: Come in. Got something to show you. Got the test results back. The lab was able to reconstruct the DNA found on marcia Chapman. Here's what that looks like. Okay. They were also able to use that one drop of sperm found on that single pubic hair of opal mills. Here's what that DNA looks like. The same. Yeah. Exactly. Here's the DNA of one of our suspects taken from the saliva sample. [ Chuckles ] Are you telling me, fae Brooks... ...that we've got him? Here's his picture. I don't even have to look. [ Tires screeching ] 19 years ago, we found the first body, and a year and a half after that, this task force was formed. Now, I've asked you back here from other duties, from other jobs, because I want you all in on this at the end. Now, you're here voluntarily. It's not an official task force, so I decided to call it the n.A.T.F., not a task force. [ Laughter ] Now, listen, we've made some mistakes over the years. For that I have regret, but we've also been accused of indifference. For that I have anger, because over all this time, never once have I heard any of you ever say, "well, these women are just prostitutes." No, you went out there like it was your daughters and your sisters gone missing. And it's because of that kind of dedication, that kind of hard work, that we're finally bringing their killer to justice. Congratulations. [ Applause ] Mullinax: Gary ridgway. I'm detective mullinax from the king county police department. [ Applause ] You're under arrest for the murders of marcia Chapman, Cynthia hinds, opal mills, and Carol christensen. You have the right to remain silent. If you give up that right, everything you say can be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you do not have an attorney or cannot afford one, one will be provided for you by the court. Okay. Let's go! Do you understand your rights as they've been read to you? [ Camera shutters clicking ] Gary Leon ridgway has been arrested in connection with the murders of four of the green river victims. [ Cheers and applause ] They've got four counts against you, Gary. Chapman, mills, and christensen by DNA, and hinds, because she was found with the first two. I didn't do it, I swear to you. I appreciate that. Now we can fight this on the lab work. I can get 10 experts, who will testify to the disintegration and deterioration of the samples tested. They're 20 years old. But if they connect you with any other victims, we're in trouble. They won't. They can't. Good. Then we'll beat this. He's gonna get off. No. You got nail him, Dave. You got to nail this guy. There's no such thing as "can't do." Remember? Now, look at this. You know all those tiny specks of paint we pulled out of the victim's clothing, just sitting downstairs doing nothing for all those years? Someone found a way to measure particles as small as one or two microns. Hey, wait, slow down. Paint, paint. Individual brands of paint can now act as fingerprints. Man: Want to bag that? There's some paint on the victim's clothes. Yeah. They're charging you with three more murders. They matched paint found on the victim's clothing with a specialized brand used only where you work. You lied to me, Gary. I... [ Crying ] I don't want to die. Please... Don't let them kill me. 19 years ago, I promised you I would find your granddaughter's killer. [ Sniffling ] I've come to ask you a favor. There are families out there whose daughters have never been found. I'm gonna make a deal with Gary ridgway. What kind of deal? Life without parole. He deserves to die. Yes, he does. But these families also deserve to Bury their daughters. And if Gary dies without talking, they'll never get that chance. She's still missing. We don't bargain with serial killers. And cost me my job! People want him dead! No, they want justice, and his death is not gonna give them that. There are over 30 bodies that we found, and we can't tie them to him yet. I've talked to the families. They want their daughters found. They want their daughters properly buried. They want to put their daughters to rest. I can't agree to this. You listen to me. These women deserve more than just his execution. They deser to be heard, they deserve a voice, and whether you like it or not, this man is the only one that can give them that voice, so you go ahead. You tell these families that their daughters don't matter, [ sighs ] Man: An agreement has been reached between king county prosecutors and Gary ridgway, granting him life without parole in exchange for full and complete disclosure regarding his crimes. The agreement, which a majority of the murdered women's families support will allow detectives to meet one-on-one with ridgway and ask questions that have stumped them for years. Relatives of 20 of the young women ridgway killed over the past two decades will get a chance to confront him in a historic sentencing hearing in king county superior court. [ Buzzer buzzes, door opens ] Gary... I'm Dave reichert. Nice to see you, Dave. So, how did you get away with it? It was easy. My appearance was... Different from... What I really was. The prostitutes were the easiest. I went from having sex with them to just plain killing them. The sight of them, for me, was like candy in a dish. They were trash. They're just trash. They didn't mean nothing to me. Once I killed them, I didn't keep it in memory. Let's talk about your trucks. You remember your trucks? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I had over a hundred at one time or another. You know I could tell you the make, the year, how much I paid for them, what kind of gas mileage they had, what color I painted each one. I can tell you who I bought them from. I can tell you who I sold them to. But you don't remember the women? I'd spend hours cruising the strip... You know, patrolling. I only slept a couple hours a night. It was kind of like my, um, career. Who was the first? I don't... Remember. I thought I killed before green river. I thought I left bodies in the streets, against fences, expecting them to be found, but they never was. Why did you put rocks in their vaginas? 'Cause I didn't want nobody to have sex with them. It was my property. When you found them and took them away, it felt like you was taking away something of mine that I put there. Those ones in the river? I pinned them down, and I wasn't gonna let these other ones get away. Then that stupid fisherman came along and wrecked everything. Good morning! But you found them anyway. Made me mad. So, I put the trout and stuff on that one just to throw you guys off. Your expert said it was like the last supper. [ Chuckles ] Man, I really... I had everyone fooled. Even the women? Oh, yeah, especially them. I never picked them up at the curb where they was working... too many witnesses. I waited for them to approach me. Mary: Hey. Hey. Could you give me a lift? Hop in. If I was the green river killer. "Do I look like the green river killer?" I'd say. And then they'd laugh. I always tried to put women at ease. I'd offer them beer, a job, a lot of money. If that didn't work, I showed them a picture of my son. [ Muffled screams ] One night, I even took him with me. Hey, bud. [ Chuckles ] Didn't mean to take so long. That nice lady we picked up... she decided to walk home. After that, when I could... ...i always took them to my house. [ Indistinct conversation ] Wow! This is nice. Well, you know, I like... whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! [ Giggling ] Oops! Gonna go see? Oh, it's so nice. See the fireplace there? Yeah. [ Laughter ] Can you fly for me right now? If you want me to. Yeah, I'd like you to... do you have to do it live, or a stunt? [ Laughs ] You can use the bathroom if you want. No thanks. I always made sure they took care of business beforehand, in case they have an accident, you know. [ Panting ] After sex, if I was behind, they always raised their head when they was done, and that gave me a clear shot. [ Chuckles ] Mmm. That was so good. That was so good. You're hurting me. Stop! No, come on. Relax. Don't fight. No, you're hurting me. I'm only hurting you because you're fighting. Just relax and I'm gonna let go. Just relax. Just relax. Relax. That's right, just relax. Let go, let go. [ Grunting ] I choked them 'cause it was more personal... more rewarding. Sometimes, I miscalculated. [ Grunting ] Later, I tied something around everyone of them, even when I thought they was dead, just to be careful. I really didn't want to get caught. It was... Not easy. I lived with a terrible burden. Getting rid of all those bodies. [ Grunting ] I didn't keep their clothes. They was rags to me. As for the jewelery, I loved seeing it on all my friends. [ Laughter ] But disposal was a pain... a waste of time and gas. If I could have dropped them down a bottomless mine shaft, it would have made it so much easier. Did you ever have post-mortem intercourse with any of your victims? Just with 10 or so. It was free. I didn't have to pay for it. We found over 40 bodies, Gary. How many more? And... ...can you take us to them? I can try. That one girl... what's her name, Ellie slater? She's the on that first led you to me. Ellie, come back here! Excuse me, sir. I hated her for that. So, I put her in a place alone, so she wouldn't have nobody with her. When was your last kill? 1985. 1991. 1998. You didn't pin her on me. That's okay. I was kind of rusty. How many? How many women did you kill? 71. I can't remember them all. Do you remember this one? [ Whimpering ] I, um... I experimented once. Facing my victim. [ Whimpering ] The way she was... That... that taught me a lesson... never to choke them with my hands, 'cause I didn't want that part to be memorized in my mind. She was looking at me and begging for me to stop, but I couldn't do that. She would have turned me in, and I wouldn't have been able to kill no more, and that meant a lot to me... to kill. I'm not gonna confess to any woman you want to pin on me, not if she isn't mine... I got pride in what I do. I'm not gonna take it from nobody else. And it wasn't a hobby. It was my career. [ Crying ] Why are you crying now? Been so long since you've killed those women. Why are you crying now? 'Cause of how I screwed up. I-I screwed up killing them. Leaving too much... ...too much... ...evidence. Is there something missing in you that other people have? Caring... That caring thing. We've come a long way. We've been through a lot together. If you think of it, we both started on that riverbank, moved on from there. Every life you touched, I touched, too. Yeah. I'm a Christian man, Gary. I believe in forgiveness. [ Sighs ] But I believe to be forgiven, you have to confess. Have you confessed? Have you told me absolutely everything? U've told me everything? Yes, yes, yes. Then I'm gonna tell you something, Gary. You make me sick. You disgust me. Everybody is deserving of the life the lord gives them... everybody, but not you, not you, because you didn't just kill these women, you destroyed every life they ever touched, every life these poor girls... you coward! You'd get behind these girls and you'd choke them from behind! You choked these 16-year-old girls! 16-year-old girls! Coward! You're a... you're a coward, Gary. You're a coward! You're evil! You're a monster! You're a broken, broken, broken thing! Broken! I am. I am. Helen: They never found me. Gary never admitted that he killed me or where he put me. I'm one of the 23 lost. On a scale... say one to five, where five is the worst possible evil you could be, what would you be? I'd say... A three? What about you? If five was the best possible person you could be? Three. I'd be a three. [ Buzzer buzzes ] Helen: To move some place, you got to let go. You got to say goodbye to the people you love and hate and don't want to forgive. But if our lives are like a poem, that, when it works, it comes spilling out like it's meant to be, we can't forget that poems are something we make. And even though we live mostly in randomness and luck, once in a while, something good and deliberate happens, and it's not just god. Sometimes it's us responsible, too. Dave proved that to me. I mean, if there is fate, we have to be able to conquer it. We really can be the masters of our lives. Against terrible odds, we can make things happen. Okay, Helen, your turn. [ Indistinct talking, laughter ]
