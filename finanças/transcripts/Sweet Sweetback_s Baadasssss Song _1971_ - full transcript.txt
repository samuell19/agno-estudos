We knew you'd be willing to lend a hand. - Hm. When did you people start getting so interested in black folks... Dead or alive?! - It's progress. - I can't. I'm short. I only got two guys working now... Donald to explain, Sweetback to train, and the two of 'em to trounce and bounce. We got a nice understanding, Beetle. - It's mutual. Everybody profits. - Let's keep it that way. - I'm the good dyke fairy godmother. Yes, the good dyke fairy godmother. Why didn't you know that all good dykes.. Had fairy godmothers?

Not too badly, I hope. - Fell down and bruised himself, sir? - Can we print that, Commissioner? - Of course. I have no secrets from the press. I don't... Sorry, sir, I don't understand. - Fine! Fine! You say the witness has given you the whereabouts of the suspect? Too bad the witness has injured himself in a fall! - Okay. Right, sir. - Proceed! - Well?
