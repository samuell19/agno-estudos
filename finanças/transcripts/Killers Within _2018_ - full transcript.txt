Brady to Hoolihan, to Hoolihan back to Brady. It crosses to Shane Long! Mommy, you're phone's ringing. It's okay, honey. Ooh. Yeah! It's three-nil and the crowd goes wild! It's your turn in goals, mister. Now. I'll be back in a second, honey. Okay. What do you want? Kevin! No! If you ever want to see your son again, I suggest you talk to your prick ex and not your pig friends. You understand? If you even... You'll what? Kevin. Amanda. What did you do? I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Get off me. What have you done? Amanda! Please, let me talk. Go on. Talk. Those Russian pricks who I put away five years ago, they got out last week. Last week? And you ring me this morning? You piece of shit, they've taken my son! -Our son, Amanda. He's my son, too. You're no father. -You never let me be one. Just finish your story. They want the 600 grand they say I owe them or they're gonna kill me. You asshole. You should've gone to jail just like them but you didn't because you're a piece of shit rat. He was a cop. It's his job to put them away. You're a cop, too, you should understand that. He was a cop. Didn't he tell you why he isn't anymore? He wanted to spend more time with you and Kevin so he quit, but you left him. You cut him outta your life. I know he's your brother and you love him, but he is a liar. I gave evidence. Gave? You sold narcotics, 600,000... 14. Sam... I sold drugs that were scheduled to be destroyed to an Eastern Bloc gang. Then I set up the operation that caught them, seized back the drugs, and kept the money. The only problem is he got caught. You didn't have to cut me outta Kevin's life, though. Yes I did! I did it for us, so we could have a better... -Enough! I am sick of it. What are we doing here dredging up a past that you're still in denial over? What are we going to do to get our son back? What's your plan now? Who's that? That's our plan. Put on the kettle there, love, will ya? What's he doing here? - I'll leave if ya want. It's not my kid - that's gone missing. - No! We need him. Hey. Why are you here? Helping me little sister of course. We'll sort this, okay? Yeah. So what's this fuckin' plan, then? Okay, it's very simple really. You can't go to the cops and you don't have the money. So you've only one option. You're gonna have to steal it. We're gonna steal 600,000 Euro? No. We're gonna steal six million. Six million? Are you outta your fuckin' mind? No, I'm not. Okay, this is a terrible situation. Why can't we get something out of it for ourselves? Jack, you said you'd help me. And I said it'd cost you. I'm sorry, buddy, but you're not the most reliable, so I'm takin' my cut from the source, okay? What do you need 5.4 million for? You ever been on a peacekeeping mission? Fuckers takin' potshots at ya all day? Ya have take it like a sap? We're not even allowed to shoot back. Pay is shit and the retirement package is even shitter. You don't need 5.4 million, though. What do you think I am, a monster? I only want one million. And you want one million, and you want one million, and you want one million, and you... -I don't want money. I want my son back. We're not doing this for a fucking cut. Why not? There's five of us. Why six million? Because you're gonna give a cool one million to those Eastern Bloc cunts to make absolutely certain that don't hurt your kid and leave you the fuck alone for the rest of your lives. Okay. Okay. Method to me madness, buddy. But robbin' more than we need only makes things more risky. How? We're robbin' the place anyway. We get caught, we're going to jail and your kid is dead. Game over. What's the difference between 600,000 and 6 million? Just a couple of extra duffle bags, that's all. The risk is the same. So we don't get caught then. What place? The Bank of Albernia. You're kidding. Your plan is to hold up the bank where you work as a security officer? Did you hit your head or something? They'll recognize you a mile away. We're not holdin' up the bank itself, just the CEO, Philip Pindar, and his family. A tiger kidnapping. A what? It's when... It's a victimless crime, okay kid? We break into the house, secure the family as hostages, bring Daddy to the bank to get the cash, bring him back, reunite him with Mommy and the darlin' children, everyone's happy. The money's insured so even the bank aren't out of pocket. The family don't even have to leave their living room. They can Netflix and chill for all I care. No one will get hurt. Worst case scenario, they'll have a few nightmares. And frankly, fuck them. Pindar's an elitist prick. He looks down his nose at everyone. His family are probably the same. You do realize that our son was taken hostage, and your plan to get him back is to take another family hostage? Where's Alanis Morissette when you need her, huh? I know it sounds bad, - but it's... - A victimless crime. A few bad nightmares. Drink? Any chance you get, eh? Another reason why I left you. Sober my ass. So the money needs to be handed over within the next 48 hours. Jack is workin' out the last few details, but the plan is pretty simple. We all have our roles, so... So who's doing what? You'll do background checks on the target. This guy is super rich so we expect top of the line security. Any direct alarm or camera links need to be shut down ahead of time. We're lucky this family live in the middle of nowhere so we expect the police to be pretty thin on the ground, but just in case, I'll need you to monitor rosters and patrol movements, anything and everything that might be useful. Jack is on equipment detail. Of course he is. What sort of equipment? Guns, vests, clothes, restraints, anything he thinks that will make us look more authentic. Where's he gonna get all of that? Jack, what are you doing up there? This is Jack we're talkin' about here. I'm just lookin' at me old comics, Ma. Put the kettle on, will ya? I presume Neville's our fly on the wall. He's opened the door for this guy for years. He's familiar with his routine. With a bit of luck, he should be able to check Pindar's schedule so he can anticipate his movements tomorrow evening. Hey ya. Okay, so Neville will have done his bit. We don't need him on the mission. You try tellin' him that. What about Sam? He's just a kid. He's not a kid anymore. He's our wheel man. We need a clean vehicle that won't link back to us. You're getting your little brother to steal cars? He's been robbin' cars since he was 12. He knows the risks. If we get into trouble on the road, no amount of donut spins are gonna help us. Sam's the best driver I know. I feel safer knowin' he was gettin' us from A to B, and helpin' us get our son back. So what's your role in all of this? I'm the one who's gonna bring Pindar to the bank, get the money, make the exchange, and bring Kevin back safely. Do you think I'm gonna leave that up to you? How was school? It was good. We learned about World War II. Ah, we should talk about that later. I might have some insights for you. Like what you told me about Newgrange? Exactly. Daddy, is all history different to what the teachers say? Some of it. Why do I have to learn it, then? Because that's what people believe. But it's not true. It's as true as it needs to be. You understand why. To maintain order, to maintain power. Exactly. Come on, dinner time. Philip. Sarah. How was your day? Satisfactory. Dinner smells good. It's just leftovers. I'll try to pick up something fresh tomorrow. Carl, honey, will you go get your sister, please? I'll get her. Carl, help your mother with the table. Dad. You scared the crap out of me. Since when did you scare so easy? Tonight's a big night for me, remember? I'm a little anxious. Ah, my little girl, all grown up. Yeah well, not grown up enough to make my own decisions about who I hook up with apparently. He's from good stock, and please don't refer to it as hooking up. We're better than that. Whatever. Your dinner's ready. I'm not hungry. You have to eat, especially tonight. Claire. Fine, down in a minute. What are you wearing? A smokin' hot dress. You are not wearing that. It's on me right now. I literally couldn't be more wearing it. It's not appropriate for tonight. You get to pick the boy, I get to pick the dress. Are we expecting guests? No. Boo. Nobody move. And drop the butter knife. Move. Is that really necessary? Yes, it is, asshole. There's no need. Here. Go play with your game. Weird kid. Anything goes wrong, it's on you. We're secure. Bring in the Jeep. Are you all right, love? Yeah. Kind of have plans for tonight. Ah, so do we, love. It'll be all right, Claire. We'll work something out. So, what's for dinner? You wouldn't like it. Everyone, listen up. Nobody will get hurt if you do exactly what we say. This, as you may have guessed, is a tiger kidnapping. You've more than likely been prepped for such an event by your employer, but just in case, let me explain. Myself and my associate here, will take you to the bank where you will make a massive withdrawal of money. My friends will stay and keep your family company. Should we not return within two hours, should I not answer their phone calls, should they even see a hint of cops or deception, they will not hesitate to seriously ruin your fucking evening. Fine. I'll get you the money. I'll do whatever you want as long as my family are unharmed. Philip. Sarah, I have to. You stay here, stay calm, and everything will be okay. I promise. Daddy, don't go. Hey, Mommy and Claire need you to be strong and to protect them, okay? These people only want money. The sooner I go, the sooner I'll be back, and the sooner I can read you a bedtime story, okay? Okay. Okay. All right. Let's get this over with. Dad. It's all right, Claire. You heard him. This will all be over soon, so just sit quiet and wait. You ready? We can't all go. I don't remember you being involved in planning this. I don't wanna mess with your plan, but I can't go in your Jeep. If I arrive in a strange vehicle, security will know something is up. It's already strange me arriving so late at night. We should take my car. It's a two seater. It's a very nice two seater. And I should drive. And you should crouch in the passenger seat. I want your plan to work just as much as you do. The money's insured. My family are my priority. I'm goin' alone. That wasn't the plan. It is now. Try not to let anyone get hurt. You don't have to tell me. Dibs drive on the way back. Well this is dull. Quiet, Claire. What? I have to miss one of the biggest nights of my life because a bunch of peasants aren't happy with their dole? What is it, your debs? Trust me, you're not missin' much. Let me guess, you spent your debs in some dinge hole nightclub fending off drunken jocks? I had slightly classier plans, thanks. Claire. Only talking, trying to break the ice. Hey you. Yeah you. You keep lookin' at the ground. What's wrong? You don't like what ya see? Or maybe ya like it a little bit too much. Ya stink of cheap deodorant, so I'm guessing you're the baby of the bunch. What are ya, like 16? I'm 22, actually. Shut the fuck up, dickhead. You wanna tell her your name and address as well? And you shut the fuck up, too. Make me. I'm not jokin' around here, princess. Now shut the fuck up! Hey! You've made your point. Please leave her alone, she'll stop talking. Honey, won't you, you'll stop talking? Fine. Sorry princess. Couldn't hear you over that loud dress. I said I'll shut up. Good girl. Fuckin' idiot. Yeah? We have the package. I repeat, we have the package and it is glorious! He took the full amount? It was just like he said, just a case of a couple of extra duffle bags. Relax. Everything is goin' to plan. Okay, okay. What's your ETA? We're makin' good time. Approximately... 45 minutes. This is all gonna be over soon, babe. Don't get ahead of yourself. Well done, sir, well done! In less than an hour, this'll all be over. They're on their way back. So just sit tight. Mommy, I need to go to the bathroom. Daddy'll be home soon, ya little shit, then you can go for a piss. But I need to go now. Can I take him? No. One of us will take him. Be quick. Carl, I'll take ya to the bathroom, all right. There's no need to be scared, buddy. Sure I'm just a silly fella with a big nose. Pinocchio? Exactly. Ya like Pinocchio? No. Right, well come on then, let's go. I'll be right back. Did you hear something? Stay there. What is it? Nothin'. It's fine. Ok, come on in. I'll be outside. It's ok, kid. I'm not going anywhere. Fuck! Sit the fuck down. - But Carl... - Sit the fuck down! I'll check him. Hey, hold it together, will ya? Nev... P... Pinocchio? Carl! Carl? Carl! What's going on? What's happened to Carl? Sit. I said sit down. What's happened to my son? Sit down, sit down. - Where is he? - Sit. What? There's someone else in this house. What you talkin' about? Neville is dead and Carl is missing. Jesus Christ. What's going on? Where is my son? Will you sit the fuck down! Hey! She's his mother! Sarah, we will find your son, I promise. If anything happens to my son, it's your fault, so help me God. Ring that prick, find out where he is. Why the fuck isn't he answering? I don't know. Okay, we'll split up. You, watch her, and you, you come with us and we'll find him together. She's a fuckin' hostage. You remember why we're here, right? He's scared. We need her to find him. This is fucked. What's goin' on? Where's Neville. Just stay focused. Sarah, does Carl have any hiding places, somewhere that he feels safe. He sometimes plays in his wardrobe in his bedroom. Okay. Let's go. Don't make this any more complicated than it is. Come on. For what it's worth, I'm not gonna hurt ya. I know. Carl's bedroom's at the end of the corridor. Is that the bathroom? Where's the body? Was he dead or what? Yes, he was fucking dead. This is fucked. Now she's gone. Sarah. You know, tonight was meant to be a big night for me. - Yeah? - Yeah. Why else do you think I'm all dressed up? Tonight was the night that I was meant to meet 'the one'. I guess that's not gonna happen now, is it? Come on, he's probably still out there somewhere. No, it's all about timing with me. It had to be tonight. Where the hell are you? What? Were you ringing me? The signal is shite down here. How far away are you? About 30 minutes. Hello? Well, what's goin' on? We're not the only ones here. What are you talkin' about? Neville is dead. How? I don't know, we're trying to find out. Did someone else have the same idea as us? I don't know. And the boy, he was with Neville, too, when it happened and now he's missing. We're trying to find him with his mother, and now she's missing, too. I'll be there as fast as I can. What was all that about? Nothin'. Everything's fine. I'm glad to hear it. Don't get us killed driving so fast. I'm sorry. Hey, it's okay. You're very gentle. These ties are hurting me. Sorry. Can you take them off? No, no I can't. But I'm scared. Come on, love, I'm gonna protect you. I'd be very appreciative. Promise. No, don't. Kinky. We should stop, this is crazy. Carl. What? You got your money, and you promised me my family would be unharmed if I cooperated. Is there something you need to tell me? Carl, are you here? Somethin' happened, but it's under control. Are my family safe? Come on. They're fine. And your people? It's under control. I'm not sure Neville would agree with you. How did you know that? I must confess, I recognized his stench as soon as he entered my home. What are you talkin' about? You think you are the hunters and we are the prey. No. No, no, no. You are the poor, weak, soft, defenseless prey and we are the hunters, the top of the pyramid, the top of the food chain. What the fuck? Come on, let's get out of here. We can't leave him. What do you mean? He's my brother. He's all of our brother. This is a unit we don't know what we're up against, okay? So we have to go before whoever done this does it to us. We need to find Sarah and the boy. We need to protect them and make this right. We need to survive, come on. Yeah, yeah, keep going. Yeah. Keep going. You done too, Foxy? Come on. Come on. Come on. Stop, please. Where have you been? We've been looking for you and Carl. Well I'm here, and he's there. You okay, kid? Oy! Let's go, go! Stop! The fuck? Oops. Lost myself in the moment. Too much, Foxy? What can I say? I just love creamy hot meat. We need to get out of here. You can't go that way. Claire's some sort of monster. Ya think? Fuck, it's locked. In here. What are you doin'? Do you think these matter anymore? Yeah, fuck it. Couldn't breathe in the fuckin' thing anyway. Where's your Kevlar? The freak ripped it off me. They look so normal. I take that back. What are they, vampires? Ah, great, they're fuckin' lizard people. You're jokin', right? And the joke's on us. And our whole fuckin' species. I knew those Illuminati fucks were real. Oh, this is fucked up. Still though, mommy lizard, even without the hair... We need to get out of here. What about Rick? Ring him and tell him not to come back. Please answer. Fuck. Hopefully daddy lizard is still playing along. We need to warn him. Call the police. No. I don't care about goin' to jail. I doubt the local pigs are gonna take us seriously anyway. Ah, hello guard, yeah, we're being chased by a bunch of fuckin' reptilians. You wouldn't come down and have a word, would ya? The last time I was talking to Rick, he said he'd be 30 minutes. Which means he should be here in the next 20. Okay, so we sit here and wait it out. Or we take the Jeep and meet him on the road. Option two it is. You lost your gun, too? And your hoodie. Seriously. Fuck it, who am I to judge? I already put one in the bitch mother and she shrugged it off. You see any of those reptilian fucks, you empty the entire clip right into their faces. Head shots or go home. That includes the kid. Now hold on. Whatever he is, he is still a child. We broke into his home. We're the aggressors here. I was willing to so this as a victimless crime to get my son back, not to become a monster and take someone else's. A monster? That little shit ripped your brother's throat out. Neville's dead? No matter what you think of me, Amanda, I'm the only one who's seen combat here. Make no mistake about it, tonight we face death. It's kill or be killed. One problem, Jeep's in the courtyard. The other end of the house through the kitchen. Okay. We go out the window, straight across the front of the house under the arch into the courtyard the way you drove in, and then you do what you do best and you get us the fuck outta here fast. Now that I can do. Let's go. Okay go, move. Whoa! Back, back, back! This way. Let's go. Up or down? Well, unless yous have a good supply of pixie dust, I think being stuck at the top of a tower is a terrible idea. Down. You ok? What the fuck? The dinner. The food under the lids. Chilled human, fuck me. And we're fresh meat. You still wonderin' who the monsters are? Come on. Motherfucker! What do we do now? Same plan, back to the Jeep. What about Sam? I might be a cunt, but I'm not a fuckin' cunt. Then why the Jeep? Backup. Backup? I just emptied me last fucking clip. I'd rather you waste them than me. Go, move. Fuck. Go, fuck. Jesus. What do we need all that for? Let's just say I'm an enthusiast with a touch of OCD. Can you smell that? Run! Lookin' a bit worse for wear, lad. This is a long shot, but I'm lookin' for a man who might've come through here. Fancy suit, probably a bit banged up like me. He's waitin' for you by the fire, but he's not a bit like you. What? Mr. Pindar is waiting for you by the fire. Compliments of Mr. Pindar. My advice, don't keep him waiting. Ah, Rick. I'm relieved to see you're okay. You were unconscious and I got a bit bored waiting for you to wake up, so I thought I'd pop in here for a quick drink before I headed home for dinner. What are you? You know, that's a very fine whiskey you're not drinking. What's in it? Oh please. If I wanted to kill you I wouldn't poison you. Spoils the meat. That's a 100 year-old scotch, blended especially for George V to celebrate... I'm more of a Jimmy man, me self. Well, you're only human. And I don't drink anymore. Mm. So, Rick, to get back to your overly simplistic question, I am, or I should say we are, the natural order. Tonight you stumbled upon something that few ever do. Help! Help! My people have been around since the dawn of time. We existed before man. We are the true master race. Strong, fast, intelligent, perfectly adapted for any environment. If we have a flaw, it's our biological clocks. Our females only have a brief window for conception. Fuckin' women, eh? Please let me go. This flaw, however, is really evolution at its most balanced. Natural population control for the top of the food chain. We are the true heirs to this planet. We thrived and we built cities like you couldn't imagine, but after a rather well-known extinction level event, when we were at our weakest, your kind fell from the trees and multiplied like a virus. Suddenly there were more of you than there were of us, but what we lacked in numbers we made up for in intellect. So we orchestrated our disappearance from this world and from your history. Now all that's left are fragments in your mythologies, along with the ravings of wild-eyed conspiracy theorists. Funnily enough, we do have one thing in common: biology. Like us, you're blessed with the limbic neocortex, otherwise known as the reptile brain that controls instinct, dominance, aggression. It's the part of you that stops you from getting killed like the overgrown lemmings that you are. But while our species evolved in harmony with these qualities, yours evolved in conflict with them, favoring irrational emotions like empathy and love. And what good did it do you? Today we rule your whole world. We control your governments, your corporations, your monarchies, your secret societies, your law enforcement, and the cornerstone of it all, your banks. Oh. He's in the tower. Oh fuckin' Jesus. Okay. But if I'm honest with you, all this protocol and etiquette can be quite wearisome. Frankly, I was delighted to see you and your friends darken my door this evening. You see, pretending to be human for so long can make us forget who and what we really are. You've made an otherwise dull night very interesting. If there was one minor gripe I have with you, it's that you ruined my daughter's courtship. My sincerest apologies. Oh, it's quite all right really. The young man she was bestowed to was from a fine bloodline but as an individual he was quite the posh twat. Besides, I'm sure she's found a young virile male among your group by now. I'm gonna fucking kill you! Is that any way to speak to the mother of your child? How would that work? Oh, our two species can breed. In fact, there are so few of us that we find it necessary to do so from time to time, just to broaden out the gene pool. You're not pregnant. Not yet, but I will be. How the hell does my brother bangin' your daughter make things interesting for you? That's not what's interesting, Rick. And then I'm gonna eat you all up. Please, just stop! Have you ever been game hunting, Rick? You appreciate the meat so much more when you kill it yourself. Anyway, I really must get going. I don't want my family to have all the fun. Please. Please let them go. We didn't mean you any harm. It was meant to be a victimless crime. I'm sorry, it's just, I like to tenderize my meat before I eat. Eat this. Fuck. No crime is victimless, Rick. You need to learn to be responsible for your actions. It's your fault you got involved with these drug dealers, got caught, ruined your career, and that they kidnapped your child. For a man so concerned with people's well-being, you have an awful lot of blood on your hands. Thanks. Head shots or go home. How did you know all that? Only a few people knew. Another one of our gifts, Rick. You can't hide anything from me. Just count yourself lucky. I like you. You amuse me. So, I've decided I'm not going to kill you. I'm going to teach you the greatest lesson of all: Responsibility. You alone will survive tonight and all your friends will perish. You can keep the money you took, pay off your drug dealers and live with the consequences of your actions. After all, the money is insured. A victimless crime. Gentlemen, I would greatly appreciate it if you could show my acquaintance Rick here some hospitality. This will cover everyone's tab for the evening. Breakages and the usual discretion. Alright, lads. Get off me, you farmer prick. I think he's finished, lads. Keys. Somebody give me some fucking car keys now or you'll be pourin' your own drinks from now on. If you are goin' back up there, make sure you finish it. This village has suffered enough. Why don't you do something yourselves? This is how it's been around here for generations. We dare not disobey them. We dare not anger them. Get away from him! Sam. Stay down. Hold still, kid. Oh Jesus. You killed my baby! Hurry up! Gotcha, bitch. No! Jack! Sam. Amanda! Amanda! Jack. Where is she? I don't know. You killed my child. You killed the life inside of me. I killed your baby! I killed your baby! I killed your little cunt freak! I did it! I killed your freak, I'm the one you want! Drop the gun. Please. You're scared. Ready when you are, princess. Don't! You're very brave. Fuckin' bitch! Defiant. Strong. Perhaps I picked the wrong man to father my child. You definitely picked the wrong guy. Put the kettle on, love. Jesus. Jack... Go get your boy. Finish the mission. I thought you didn't care about my son. I always cared. I just wished he was... mine. Ours. I thought you hated me. I love you. I always have. Amanda... Rick still loves you. Sam. Sam! Can you walk? I can run. Thank God, this must be Rick. It's just them in a different car. I can't see the driver. Oh shit. Go. Fuck, he's gonna rip us apart. No. Sam? What about Rick? Rick left with Philip. He didn't come back. Come on. Fuck! No, don't! You killed my family. You killed mine first. You think your brother and that gang of misfits is any way equal to my dynasty? Run! Hide! Drown in the fear of the agony that is coming for you. Where's Sam? Jack? He's not dead. This one's for Neville. This one's for Jack. In the head! And this one's for me brother Sam. Now you both will die. And you think we're the monsters. We're done now, yeah? Maybe. Maybe not. Trust me, we're fuckin' done. Subtitles by explosiveskull
