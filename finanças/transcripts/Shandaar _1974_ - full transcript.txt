'Lakshmi Mansion.' Please sit! Are you all fine? Yes! Mr. Shastri! - Yes? Did your son get a seat in medical college? Sir, you forget the good deeds that you do. He got a seat. He has become MBBS. He has started his practice even. Is that so? He became a doctor? Yes, Mr. Shankar. Did your child pass his inter? Yes. He is going to enroll himself for BA. Okay. - But.. What? Shortage of fees? Say it openly. Mr. Rajan, when the giver is aware of the mendicant's need.. ..why should the mendicant say the same? Fine. Send your child to my office tomorrow. I will give him a year's fees. Greetings. - Greetings. Good morning! - Good morning! Good morning! - Good morning! Good morning! Here! - Here! Do you all use the matches of my factory? Yes! No matchstick is better than Kabutar brand. - Yes. No flattery. Sir, Kabutar (Pigeon) is considered the symbol of peace. Thanks to Allah, my boss's brand name is Kabutar. Sir, Kabutar eats less but it provides livelihood to many people. It's all your grace, sir. Kabutar is my family's grandeur. At the time when my great-grandfather opened.. ..Kabutar brand matches factory.. ..my family was an ordinary family. This brand has taken us to great heights. Yes. Boss, today you didn't crack any joke. Earlier you used to make your staff laugh out loud.. ..as soon as you entered the office. I forgot. Hear a joke. A man put a golden chain around an emaciated itching.. ..dog's neck and he was strolling with it on the street. A passer-by saw this and he asked. Where are you taking this donkey? The man said, 'Can't you see?' It's not a donkey, it's a dog. The passer-by replied, I wasn't asking you.. ..I was asking the dog. Wow, sir! Is it a sin for you to laugh? - Why, boss? I cracked a joke, but you didn't laugh. Boss, my father told me this joke when I was only 4 years old. How can I laugh on hearing the same old joke? I see! My joke is old! What's your name? Chandar. See me in my room after half an hour. Hello! What did you say? Share's price is declining. - Yes, boss. Do one thing. Buy some more shares. Boss, people are selling it and you wish to buy? I am putting my money at stake! Not anybody else's! Buy it! Secretary. Yes, boss. Please come and see me! Coming, boss! Yes, boss! Are the cheques ready? Cheques for charity? Here. 2000 rupees for blind people's relief association. 10000 rupees for the dumb and deaf. 5000 rupees for Hindu Orphanage Centre. And 2000 rupees for Islam Orphanage Centre. Good! You definitely know your job! Boss! Boss, you'd called me. No need to remind me. How long have you been working here? - 6 months. I see! Pratima.. I am making Chandar my factory's works manager. Boss.. many senior employees are working in this factor. Won't it be injustice to them? I very well know who deserves which post. Good morning, boss! - Good morning! Ramchand! Bhalu! Everybody, come here! - Coming, boss! Mr. Chandar is now factory's works manager. You all will have to follow his orders. Got it? - Yes, boss! Boss, this factory is our life. And you are our boss. We will obey all your orders. Carry on! Boss, I think you have given me this treat.. ..because you have again been elected as the mayor. No, Chandar. This is not true. I gave this treat.. because I like you. Thank you, boss. Chandar, you shouldn't feel shy while eating. I am eating to my heart's content. Maybe, you are not used to eating with knife and spoon. At home, I eat using hands. Actually, Indian food is typically unique. You don't relish it until you don't eat it with your hands. Chandar, the food and not the hands carries the taste. Right, Pratima? Everybody's opinion and taste is different. Sure! Let's sit in the hall for sometime. Come, Chandar. Chandar, do you like fruits? Fruits and flowers are nature's gift. But flowers are to be sniffed and fruits are to be eaten. Here. No. I've had enough of food. The amount of food that boss fed me, it comprises my two meals. No, thanks. I will leave now. Goodbye. Greetings. Come Mr. Dalpatram. Sit. What's the matter, Mr. Rajan? Today Lakshmi mansion is holding a feast. Would you prefer food or fruit? Animals eat fruits. It's made for animals. Right, Mr. Rajan? Only animals can understand animals. Human too are a species of animal. But have only two legs. Rajan, today there is a dog show in the city. Meaning, display of dogs. I have bought a ticket for you as well. Let's go. You too are participating? - What! I can't come. Take my dog along. I will shoot you! Will I accompany a dog? No, my dog will accompany you. - Daddy! Mr. Rajan! You always break Chandni's heart. Do consider that she comes to you with high hopes. She does come. But she doesn't leave. Why should I leave? This is my house! And you are my bride. Dear, don't joke. Mr. Rajan, who is he? He is Mr. Chandar. He is my factory's works manager. He is Mr. Dalpatram. He is the owner of Murgi brand match factory. Glad to meet you. - Likewise. Here. Mr. Rajan, whenever I drink coffee, I happen to recall Shanta. After Shanta's death, Lakshmi mansion.. ..seems to have lost its grandeur. Only a woman can make the house radiant. This house will surely change someday. Some fortunate girl will surely.. ..be the mistress of this house, Mr. Rajan. What are you trying to say? It's crystal clear. Who knows? Maybe, Chandni will be the mistress of this house. I don't need Chandni or any other girl. I prefer living in darkness. You always say the same thing whenever you come. I don't like it at all! Henceforth, stop coming here! Daddy! He is totally mad! Idiot! What does he thinks of himself? Look Madam. When you go to a decent man's house.. ..you should take his name respectfully. Hey, you old man! Do you think I am Goddess? Do you think I am a stone idol? I was born in an AC hospital. All cold and chilly. I studied in a convent school. In college, I made all the guys dance to my tune. I am the symbol of modern youth. Come on, daddy. Let's get out. Dinu uncle.. who were they? Chandar sir, there are a few people in the world.. ..who hurt others for their selfish motives. And there are a few like Rajan sir. Cherishing the old memories, they fall in love.. ..with loneliness and sorrow. They hide their tears behind their smile. Thus they revere the old bonds. Bonds.. of many lifetimes. Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Tea. Tea. Its 6 30. Good evening! - Come. What is this? Leaving all the fruits you are eating this raw mango. I was feeling nauseous. I see! What! Really! Will I have to eat it? Mr. Rajan! Nurse, how is Shanta? Sorry, Mr. Rajan. We could only save the child. Not the child's mother. Munni! Munni! Munni! Munni! Munni! Munni! Munni! Munni! Munni! Munni! Munni! - No, sir! Munni! Munni!

Today I am 5 minutes late. You will have to pay penalty for 5 minutes. Where did you buy this painting from? I didn't buy it. I myself painted it, boss. I am fed up of this word 'Boss'. This word suits in office but not at home. It resembles me. I started with some other intention. But I don't know. You are a foolish girl. That's why you made me your secretary. Don't waste time. My each minute is worth a thousand rupees. Time is yours. But the money you earn belongs to the world. Don't flatter me. Let's go. We are getting late. - Come. Members! There is a world conference of all the match factories in Paris. I too have received an invitation. I am thinking of sending such a man who proves.. ..to be a responsible representative of our match factory. That's why I have called for this meeting. Pundit, will you be able to handle this responsibility? Why not, if you say so? It's not that, Pundit. You are aware of your capability. But the lifestyle of foreign countries.. ..gelling with others, way of dressing and talking to others.. ..all these issues are important. If you think I am an orthodox man.. ..then you can send somebody else. Mr. Rama Shankar is junior to me. Mr. Rama Shankar, I know.. in fact everybody knows.. ..you are a loyal employee. You do your work diligently. But I think we should send a young man for this task. This is the world of flaunting. What do you all think about Chandar? Boss, your opinion is good. Nobody can be better than Chandar for this task. Yes, boss. Chandar is the most handsome amongst us. He is young. He even has good communication skills. Boss, you always spot the gem. Thank you very much! You know that I don't take any step without your advice. Now you all may leave. Except Chandar. Chandar, I am giving you this opportunity.. ..after depriving many people from it. I am certain, you will spread our factory's fame in foreign countries. Good luck! Boss, I am indebted to you. But I have some helplessness.. ..because of which I can't go out of town. Don't talk rubbish! You don't get such an opportunity very often! I understand, boss. I regret to refuse it. Chandar, nobody has ever refused me. That might be true. But I have to. Don't misunderstand me, boss. I see. I can't understand anything. I can't see! I don't know what is right and what is wrong! Isn't this what you mean? No, boss. This is not what I.. - You can go! No need to say anything else! Munni. My name is not Munni. I am Rani. Fine. Rani. Children shouldn't play at such dangerous places. Come. Wait, mister! Shall I ask you something? - Yes. If children shouldn't play at such dangerous places.. ..where should they play? You are a talkative child. What to do? God has given me such a big tongue. You are talkative and lovable too. What's my fault in this? God has made me lovable. Yes. That's true. Have you come with your nanny or alone? Mister, children never venture out alone. Is that so? I don't have any nanny. I have my papa. He comes with me everyday. Where is your mummy? Papa says she is in heaven. Oh! Where is your papa? He's sitting there. I see! Dear, had your breakfast? - Yes. Did you eat the entire egg? I didn't eat all of it, papa. I ate the egg white and the yolk. Not the covering. Talkative! Papa, yesterday when I was playing, I met an uncle. He too said I am talkative. - Is that so? Chandar! - You? You and at my house? Papa, he is that uncle! Come here! Chandar, you are very decent. But in today's world, decency is not appreciated. You should have clearly told me that.. ..you had to look after your child. Unnecessarily, you made me feel.. ..remorseful and embarrassed. Dear, I am sending your papa to Paris by plane. Uncle, where is Paris? It's far away across the ocean. Fair people live there. When your papa will return from Paris.. ..he will bring loads of toys for you. Is that so, uncle? So send my papa to Paris. When your papa will go to Paris.. ..with whom will you stay? I am such a fool! I didn't think of that. Who are you? Dear, he is the owner of the factory where I work. I will stay at his house. I will play with his children and with aunt. Dear, children and aunt are not there. I will play with you. Fine? Chandar, I hope you won't refuse now. There is no need to. I will go. Papa, you will travel in plane. The plane has started. Here it goes! Did you see? Isn't it good? - No! No! Fine, leave it. Watch this. Motor car! There it sped away! Rajju.. I think she doesn't like all these toys. She doesn't like toys. What else do I give her? What a beautiful ring! Will you play with this? Here. Rajju, why did you remove this ring? This is the symbol of Lakshmi mansion's prosperity. Senior sir never removed this ring from his finger, Rajju. Come on. Get up. You don't like toys. I don't understand how to please you. Okay.. - No! Uncle! I want this doll! Munni! Dinu uncle! What's the matter, Rajju? Uncle, she liked the doll which Munni did. Uncle, I feel as if Munni has returned. Munni! Uncle, my name is not Munni. I am Rani. What's the harm if I call you Munni? Let me call you Munni. I will buy whatever you want. Okay, uncle. If it makes you happy then call me Munni. You are a nice girl. Dinu uncle, remind me today while going to the office. I will place an order for a musical doll for Munni from Japan. What is that, uncle? Dear, it's a beautiful doll. - I see. It can even sing. - Is that so? Yes. Dear, it will take many days.. ..for the doll to arrive from Japan. I will sing. I will tickle. I will sing. I will tickle. You! Chandni! - Yes, daddy. What's going on? I am making the servant scratch my back, daddy. Oh no! Have I kept the servant to cook or to scratch your back? Look, dear. - Yes. Young girls don't make the servant do such things. Yes, daddy! - Daddy! When your back will itch then you will know how it feels! Harder! Daddy, it's itching a lot. My luck is bad! God gave me this crazy child! Crazy! Sit down! - Sit! Hello! Hello! Is it Rajan speaking? Yes, speaking. Who is this? You don't recognize my voice? Chandni speaking. Your moonlight! Moonlight is not needed during daytime! I will shoot you! How dare this guy slam the phone down! If I ever meet him alone, I will bash him black and blue! He slammed the phone down and you kicked me! Come on, my elephant! O my friend! Not here, that way! Munni! You are back from school so early. - Yes! What did you learn in school today? Uncle, poetry. Is that so? Which poem? 'Twinkle-twinkle little star. How I wonder what you are!' Wow! Saw that, uncle? Munni is very intelligent. Dear, tomorrow when you will go to school.. Uncle, you are naive. - Why? Tomorrow is a holiday. - Why? Christmas holiday! Tomorrow is Christmas? - Yes! Wait. Hello. Rajan here. Yes, boss. Today, under work pressure, I forgot that tomorrow is Christmas. I want to send toys and sweets for the convent children. I have made the arrangement. You have done it. Good! Okay! Good she reminded me. Every year on Christmas I have to.. ..arrange for a Santa Claus. Uncle, what is Santa Claus? Dear, Santa Claus is a kind old man. Fat and stout. He loves children. And every year on Christmas Eve.. ..he descends from the sky to meet them. Uncle, how does that old man descend from the sky? Doesn't he fall down? No, dear. He has a sledge. In that sledge, he comes down. He gives children whatever they want. Uncle, will Santa Claus come to our house? Yes. Why not? - When? On Christmas Eve. At 12 o'clock. Will Santa Claus give me whatever I ask? Yes, surely. Why not? "Santa Claus comes." "Riding on a reindeer sledge and singing a song." "Santa Claus comes." "Riding on a reindeer sledge and singing a song." "Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!" "Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!" "Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!" "Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!" "I have brought toys from all over the world." "I have brought toys from all over the world." "Blue, yellow and beautiful toys." "A fat bride and a rubber doll." "Old man and old woman." "The monkey is dancing." "The monkey is dancing." "The bear is playing the lyre." "Santa Claus comes." "Riding on a reindeer sledge and singing a song." "Santa Claus comes." "When children will wake up in the morning." "When children will wake up in the morning." "Picking up toys from beneath the pillow, they will run." "Opening their packet they will dance and tell everybody." "What?" "Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!" "Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!" "Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!" "Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!" "Santa Claus is leaving." "He will come back next year." "Santa Claus is leaving." "He will come back next year." Santa Claus! You have come! I saw you in my dream. Wait! I will call my uncle! Uncle! No, dear. I meet only children. Elders can't see me. Fine. Santa Claus, where is your sledge? I have left it with moon. Santa Claus, what all things have you brought for me? I have brought many things! Look, toys, Christmas cake.. ..bubble gum and toffee. Uncle too brings all these things for me everyday. Dear child, what do you want? Will you give me whatever I ask for? Why not? Really? Promise! - Promise! Shall I tell you? - Yes. I want a mummy. You want a mummy? Yes. I am just asking for a mummy. Mummy! What are you thinking? You have promised me. Uncle too told me that Santa Claus.. ..will give me whatever I ask for. Bring my mummy! - Dear.. Papa too used to say that my mummy has gone on the moon. Go to the moon. Bring my mummy in your sledge. Look, dear. At the moment, your mummy is sleeping on the moon. It's not good to wake her up. In the morning, I will wake up your mummy.. ..and bring her in my sledge. Fine. Do bring her. If you didn't bring my mummy in the morning.. ..then I will say that you are a bad old man! No, dear. When you will wake up in the morning.. ..your mummy will be in your room. Now go to sleep. Goodnight! Goodnight! Mummy! Mummy, you have come! Mummy, you have come back from the moon! Look, this is our house. Was there a better house than this on the moon.. ..that you were not willing to come back? Come, mummy. I will introduce you to my uncle. Uncle! What's the matter, Munni? Uncle, look! Here is my mummy! Is that so? My mummy is so pretty. Yes, Munni. I too liked your mummy. - More than me? No! How is that possible? Munni, tell Dinu uncle to make a nice cup of tea for your mummy. I will myself get it. I did what you said. But being a kid's mother.. It's just for a few days. When Chandar will return from Paris.. ..her attention will be diverted on her father. Till then, who will look after the office? Don't worry about the office. I will look after it. Inflation is on the rise. It's difficult to make both the ends meet. We want three months bonus. Yes! We want three months bonus! Yes! You won't get it! Next month onwards, I will stop your salary even! I will sack all of you! Dalpatram! - Down with him! Dalpatram! - Down with him! Dalpatram! - Down with him! Dalpatram! - Down with him! Dalpatram! - Down with him! Dalpatram! - Down with him! Daddy, what slogan are they shouting? Shall I join? Dalpatram! Hey! Dalpatram is your father! Dalpatram! Down with him! Dalpatram! Down with him! She is mad and she will make me go crazy! Dalpatram! Down with him! Dalpatram! Down with him! There are slogans outside and inside too. I think I have come to some graveyard. I will shoot! - Me or the workers? You, Tolaram! - Then I am gone! Keep it inside! Tolaram! - Yes! You can never reform. My father! - Yes! He is a miser, a frugal man! I will go and announce 5 years bonus! - Wow! Then! - Then! Then I will teach Kabutar factory's owner Rajan a lesson. Pratima, did you deposit Kolkata party's cheque? Pratima! Oh God! What has happened to me? Did I have a drink early in the morning? I myself told her to stay at home. Hello! Pratima! Rajan here! What's going on? I am playing with Rani. She doesn't like it without me. Are you facing any problem in the office? No. Office work is important and you are needed at home too. Mummy! Whose call is it? - It's boss. Boss! What's that, mummy? - Boss is like God. Is that so? Give me the phone. I will talk to God. Hello, God! Greetings! This is Rani from earth! My mummy has returned to me. Don't call her back on moon. Dear, what will you do if I call your mummy back? Shall I tell you? I won't drink milk. I won't sleep. And I will cry a lot! No, dear! Don't cry! Fine. I won't call your mummy. I will let her stay with you. Fine? God, you are so nice. I will give you a kiss. It was a sweet kiss. Thank you! Mummy, God even talks in English. Mummy, you too give a kiss to God. God only takes kiss from children. Not from elders. Is that so? "If there hadn't been children in this big world." "If there hadn't been children in this big world." "There would have been only deceit." "If these children hadn't been there." "If there hadn't been children in this big world." "There would have been only deceit."

"If these children hadn't been there." "If there hadn't been children in this big world." "There would have been only deceit." "If these children hadn't been there." "In this big world." Rajju, did you like the food today? Dinu uncle. - Yes. I had such delicious food after a big gap. Everyday you cook food like this. Rajju, Pratima cooked today's food. Is that so? Pratima cooks such delicious food. Good people do every task well. They talk sweetly. And they have good thoughts. Rajju, now I have grown old. I am lying on my death bed. Who will cook food for you after me? Uncle, don't worry about the future. Chandar is returning. Munni! Oh no! By now, his plane must have landed. What happened, uncle? Munni, your papa is returning. - Papa is returning? Yes! When he'll come and see that my mummy too has returned.. ..he will be delighted. Good morning! He has come! Hi, Chandar! How was the trip? It was excellent! What did you do to your moustache? This is the current trend. - Okay. Papa! - My child! How are you, dear? Were you sad in my absence? For a day, I was sad. Then uncle loved me a lot. Is it? Yes. He brought me a mummy too. Mummy, you too come here! Papa, talk to mummy. How are you? - Fine. Papa, you are folding your hands as if she is your mummy. She is my mummy. Dear, every woman is somebody's mother. He wrote me everything about you in the letter. You have loved my child more than a mother. Just thanking wouldn't suffice. Still I'd say it. Thanks. Thanks a ton. Come on, dear. Let's go home. Papa, this too is our house. Dear, this is your uncle's house. Now that I have returned, let's go home. Uncle, papa has returned from aboard. Today I will go with him. Tomorrow I will come back. Surely, dear. Chandar, Munni has become an integral part of my life. I will come to your house everyday to meet her. Come, mummy! Where, Rani? - Home. Rani, she can't come with us. Why? She is my mummy! Dear, how do I explain to you? Come! No! I will take mummy along! Rani, don't be stubborn. Come with me. I told you! I will take mummy with me! Are you coming! Mummy! Papa is scolding me! You are harping about mummy! I will slap you! No, dear! Don't cry! Look, Chandar. Children are like flowers. The way flowers wither when the wind is gusty.. ..similarly children too wither when you scold them. After all, she is a small girl. Go, Pratima. Me? Yes. You know that I can't see tears in Munni's eyes. My happiness lies in that of hers. Munni, take your mummy. I will drop them home and then return to office. - Okay. Come, mummy! Bye, uncle! Bye! Bye! Bye! Come. This is my small house. So what? The person who lives in the house should be bighearted. Thanks. I am going to the factory to report the trip to boss. Till then stay with Rani. - Yes. Surely. Thanks. Come, mummy! I am suggesting these changes keeping in mind.. ..whatever I saw in the outside world. People are no longer interested in old things. Everybody wants new design. No matter what business it is, customer satisfaction comes first. Outside firms make new designs and new brands everyday. Chandar, there might be many changes in matchbox business. Our Kabutar brand will never change. The label will remain the same. Matches will remain the same. Boss, being rigid in business matters.. ..is like being your own enemy. Chandar, I had sent you as my company's representative. I never thought that you would come back.. ..and change my family brand. I follow certain principles in life. And I am not ready to forsake my principles at any cost. I know the value of Kabutar brand matches. Mummy! - Yes. I have changed my clothes. Why didn't you? Because my saris are at home. Mummy, you forgot? There are many saris in my house. Whose? - Yours. Who else? Mummy, come. I will show you. Papa says all these are your saris. Here! This is a nice sari. Wear this, mummy. Don't be stubborn, Rani. I will wear it later. Will you wear the sari or shall I cry? 'You know that I can't see tears in Munni's eyes.' 'My happiness lies in that of hers.' Mummy! - Yes. What are you thinking? Nothing. Give. I will wear it. - My nice mummy! Sorry. Rani was insisting that I wear this sari. You did the right thing. You didn't break my child's heart. I don't have anybody in this world besides Rani. Its evening. You didn't switch on the lights. Now permit me to go home. Come, I will drop you. - No. I will manage. Bye, Rani. We will meet tomorrow. Mummy, you want to leave me and go back on the moon! I won't let you go! Don't be stubborn, Rani. I will come tomorrow. When you are going to come tomorrow.. ..then why are you leaving? Listen to me, Rani. God will get upset if I stayed here at night. - So what? Dear, don't be stubborn. Let her go. Why? - Rani, I will slap you. Papa, I will cry before you slap me. No, Rani. Let her cry! You leave! Mummy, don't leave me! Rani! Don't cry! Listen to me! You too come with me! Papa, shall I go? Rani! I will slap you! You shouldn't beat children. Boss will get angry if he found out that you slapped her. Rani, I won't go. I will stay here. Fine? Now smile. Smile. Mummy! - Yes. Where is papa? - He is sleeping in the hall. Take me to papa. No, dear. He is tired. He needs rest. Mummy, we too will go and sleep there. Come, mummy. Come! What's the matter, Pratima? Rani wants to sleep with you. Come, dear. Come to me. Mummy, you too sleep here. Dear, you sleep here with mummy. I will go and sleep inside. No, papa. You too sleep here. Dear, there is not enough space here. So come inside. There is enough space here. Come, papa. Come, mummy. You both sleep on the bed. I will sleep on the floor. Come, dear. Mummy! What happened, Rani? Come to me. I am with you. Mummy, here. Rani! Go to sleep quietly! There is no space for her to sleep! There is enough space here! Will you sleep? Nowadays you have become very stubborn! Mummy! Mummy! Don't make the child cry. I have come here to fulfill all her desires. Again you have become lonely. Try to recall, dear. Once upon a time, this was a flourishing house. One by one, everybody went away. Senior sir died. Shanta died. Munni too. Rajju, without any family member, a house is not a house. This is the norm of the world. Listen to me. Forget the old memories. I know you will say there can't be another girl like Shanta. I will say it's not true. There is one. Pratima is just like Shanta. Since a long time I have been observing.. ..you dwell in a corner of her heart. While she was here for a few days.. ..this house felt like home. Since the time she has left, this house has again become forlorn. Rajju, I consider you as my child. You are my master. Consider this as an elder's request. Restore the lost joy of this house. Since a long time I have been explaining to you.. ..that you can't spend your life just with memories. You can't, Rajju. You can't. Do one thing. Today, before going to sleep, peep into your heart once. Maybe, you will hear Pratima's voice in some corner of your heart. 'Pratima, I don't know why there is a new joy in my heart.' 'Its difficult for me to decide whether.. ..I have brought this joy or it's somebody else.' 'I don't know where my joy will take me to.' 'Pratima, till date, you have been by my side willingly.' 'Will you become mine forever?' 'Don't consider this letter as your boss's order.' 'Your consent will fill my life with joy.' 'Your refusal will elevate your esteem in my eyes.' 'Rajan.' Dinu uncle. Deliver this letter to Pratima in the morning. Pratima? - Yes. Earlier, our business's graph was on the rise. And now it's declining. If our matches' sale continued to decline.. ..then what about our factory? Boss, when your ancestors started this factory.. ..at that time, there wasn't any competition. This is a competitive age! People see new things and they forget the old. New is better than old goods. What else do you want to say? I just want to request you that if you didn't accept.. ..the plan which I have submitted regarding the factory.. ..then people will even start hating the face of Kabutar. Boss.. you didn't throw my plans in the dustbin. But you have slapped me. There can't be a better way to humiliate somebody. Chandar, I think you have forgotten.. ..that Lakshmi mansion's Kabutar brand match factory.. ..was started in 1870. Every person is aware of Lakshmi mansion. Every person knows Kabutar brand matches. Bear in mind. This matchbox will remain the way it is. Kabutar label on it too will remain. There were 60 matchsticks in this box. And it will remain so in the future too. I again request you to leave this. Times are changing. Time can change. World can change. Lakshmi mansion will not change. The principles of that house will never change. If my opinions are useless, if my opinions are not important.. ..then why do you want to keep me as your employee? Chandar! I don't want to be labeled as a disloyal employee.. ..of a bankrupt factory. If you can't change, then accept my resignation letter. You gave me such an esteemed position. You sent me to Paris. I will forever remain indebted to you. I see. So you want to resign. Think once more. Jobs are not easily available these days. I know, boss. I will open my own matchbox factory.. ..in this city on a small scale. It doesn't mean that I want to compete with you. I want to test whether the training which I received from you.. ..was of any use. Surely! You can open your own factory! But I will inaugurate it. Good luck! Boss! - What happened? A guy had come. Pratima madam has sent this letter for you. Pratima! She sent her reply pretty soon! Today, I am coming at 7 o'clock to talk about my marriage. You are my God. My happiness lies in yours. I will do whatever you want. Pratima. Ramu! Birju! Where is everybody? - Yes, sir. Pratima is coming. Cook all her favorite dishes. You go and get some flowers. You bring fruits. You bring sweets. And.. what else does she like? Bring everything! I want everything within an hour! Pratima! Come! Sit! What will you have? Nothing. Did you receive my letter? We will talk about the letter later. What will you have to eat and drink? Not now. First let me talk about this matter. Fine. As you wish. You know that I am alone in this world. I don't have anybody besides you. I have come to you to know your opinion. My opinion? That's the way it is. It's the norm of nature. Every woman's life is incomplete without a man. That's true. That's why.. I.. I understood. Look, Pratima. Marriage is not a bond which can be broken easily. This is a sacred bond. There are many joys and happiness in this world. This joy has its own place. Husband and wife's relationship.. ..is very delicate and intense. If you don't want this, you can refuse. My respect for you will elevate.. and not decline. It's good that you understood everything before I spoke. You are so kind. No flattery. First think about yourself. Before taking such a big step, you should think whether the man.. ..whom you are going to marry can keep you happy. Boss, I think Chandar will be a good husband. Chandar? - Yes, Chandar. He has proposed to marry me. I was wondering on how to begin the conversation with you. You like him very much. You have taken him to great heights. Even Rani can't live without me. She needs a mother's love. The house where you sent me to pretend as a mother.. ..today, I really want to perform the duty of.. ..a mother and wife in that house. Pratima, its very difficult to find.. ..a good girl like you in this world. You have chosen such a good life partner. Chandar is very fortunate. Go and make preparations for marriage. I will meet all the expenses. Live happily. Shall I leave? - All right. Oh dear Pratima, so you are here? I searched high and low for you. Mr. Rajan has.. - Uncle Dinu, please come here. You go, Pratima. Uncle. - Yes, son? Return that letter to me. - Here. Dear, is the marriage fixed? - Yes, father. O' God, thank you so much! With Chandar! - What are you saying, Rajju? Uncle, I always give something to the world.. ..and I have given today as well. - No! No, Rajju! Uncle, why is papa putting a garland round mummy's neck? Munni, your papa and mummy are getting married. Really? When will you get married, uncle? Munni, after you get married. May, God bless you both. Pratima, I never missed anything in my life.. ..but the factory will surely miss you. The workers will feel miserable watching your empty chair. Still, we wish that you both prosper in your life. This is a gift on behalf of the factory. A golden pigeon. Chandar, stretch your hand towards me. This ring suits better in the finger of a married man. Keep it carefully. Uncle Dinu.. this is the key of my new bungalow. Today on, that bungalow belongs to you both. But I won't give it for free. I'm a businessman.. ..I will definitely take something in return. Command me, boss. You will have to permit me to play.. ..with Munni daily at that bungalow. You are asking permission from me, boss? You are an angel. You have always given something to the world all your life. You had given us a lot too. Today, you gave us this new bungalow. The giver never becomes bankrupt, nor will he ever. Who am I to give anything to anyone? God gives me and I distribute it to the people on His behalf. Chandar, meet your friends. Dear Rajju, you didn't do the right thing.. ..by giving your ring to Chandar. This ring was the symbol of your family's fortune, dear. Uncle Dinu, a man's destiny is not written in a ring, but here. What's wrong? Boss, four months have passed since Pratima's marriage. There is overload of work at the office. You have many responsibilities. Why don't you hire a new secretary? Mr. Ram Prasad, the chair which Pratima has vacated.. ..that will always be that way. I'll shoot you! Hi, Lollypop! - Hi. Where is your ice-cream? Did she run away? Hey? Which ice-cream? - That fraud and cheater, Pratima. She eloped with one of your workers. - Don't talk rubbish! She didn't run away, she's got married. What nonsense! Which fool will ever marry her? Neither she has a beautiful face, nor is she attractive. Tell me something, Chandni. - Yes? You were not spotted in this office since many days. Pal, don't you know, I had gone for honeymoon. Darjeeling, Nainital, Kullu Manali, Uttakanam. Congratulations! So you got married at last! - What nonsense! Who has got married? - Then this honeymoon!? With my boyfriend. - I see! God bless him. Good. What God? When I will get married to you.. ..I will go on a honeymoon for the second time. Darling, instead of honeymoon, its better you go to the moon. What? - You go; I have to do my work. Didn't you hear it is a crime to work? Oh! It's 12 30! I've given an appointment to 3-4 boys at 12 o' clock. Poor ones must be waiting impatiently outside the restaurant. Okay, bye. Oh! Please give me 100 rupees, pal. I will spend on the guys and they'll become happy. Why? Doesn't your daddy give you money nowadays? Daddy gives money only on interest.. ..and I don't want to pay that. All right. Here. Take 200 rupees instead. - Thanks. And do me a favor by not coming to this office for 5-6 months. Why this condition? This office is my would-be office.. ..and your house is my future abode. And you are my future.. Bye. Pratima! - Welcome, boss. Don't call me boss now. The matter of office is restricted to office. Where is Munni? - She has gone to play.. ..in the neighborhood, she must be coming. I've brought two tickets for Chandar and you. These are the tickets of a very good English movie. Only two? And Rani? - She will play here with me.. ..and you both will go to watch the movie. Good evening, boss. - Good evening, Chandar. Looking very smart! Congratulations, Chandar. Now a baby boy will arrive to play with Munni. Thank you, boss. Uncle! What have you brought for me? Oh! I am sorry; I forgot to bring anything. Uncle is a liar! A chocolate is winking at me from uncle's pocket. Saw, Pratima? She is so sharp. She has two eyes in front and two behind. Hello? Yes, speaking. What's wrong? What!? What happened, Rajju? What's wrong? What's the matter, son? Why don't you say anything, Rajju? Rajju!? What's wrong?! - Nothing, uncle. I had purchased the share of a foreign company.. ..and that company has gone bankrupt. It has gone bankrupt? What loss did you incur, dear? 50 lakh rupees. - 50 lakhs!? Never mind, dear. There are ups and downs in life. One wave takes a man towards the whirlpool.. ..and the other wave brings him to the shore. Don't take such things seriously, dear. God will give you more; he will give you double than this. Right, Rajju? - Yes. Here. These are your wife's signatures, right? - Of course. Very good. May God prosper your factory! And I don't have to mortgage your bungalow. Here, take your amount. Total 2 lakh rupees. Mr. Dalpatram, is the entire amount given in 1 rupee notes? Yes. Nowadays, there are rumors that government.. ..will change 5, 10 and 100 rupee notes. That's why I arranged your amount in one rupee notes. Its okay, isn't it? - Yes. Okay, Mr. Chandar, I take your leave now. Firstly, you have taken the loan with 3% interest per month. Above that, you have mortgaged the house too. Remember, Chandar? Boss had given us this house lovingly, as our marriage gift. By mortgaging this house, we've humiliated such a.. ..good man who lives for others. If I didn't mortgage the house, from where I'd have.. ..got the finance to invest in the factory? I can't beg on the streets, right? Instead of humiliating someone's love, it's better to beg. If boss comes to know that we've mortgaged.. ..the house he had gifted us, what will he think about us? Even he won't be as shocked as you, Pratima. Now stop thinking about boss in every matter. We should think about our benefit too. I am going to start a new business. Don't argue and nag and obstruct my work. All the best! - Thank you, boss. Please come. 'Eagle Brand Matchbox has become such a big company!?' 'Kabutar is still a lion in front of Eagle.' Mr. Work Manager, why wasn't this order sent on time? You know my principles. Not even a second should be wasted, time is money. Eagle Brand matchbox sales are increasing day by day.. ..we are getting orders in abundance. If you work in this way, how will we meet these orders? The first principle of business is to supply on time. Understood? - Yes, boss. No, cancel all the appointments today. And yes, call up Mr. Jang and tell him that.. ..I'll meet him after returning from Calcutta. That's right. Fine. Please come. Have a seat. Please sit here. Make a call at Calcutta and.. ..inform them to send the car to the airport. Yeah. Fine. Yes? What is the purpose of your visit? Today, I've come to reduce the burden of my heart. What's wrong? - Our boss is going bankrupt day by day. Why? What happened? He had purchased shares worth.. ..50 lakh rupees from a foreign company. That company went bankrupt. After that, he purchased stuff for his matchbox factory. Then it rained during the night, the godown roof was leaking.. ..all the stuff got drenched and became useless. This also caused a loss of 8-10 lakh rupees. And now the condition of the factory is like an orphan kid! Oh! I see! I explained boss several times.. ..that a man should change with time. Boss will never change. In such a financial crisis too.. ..he is taking loans on interest and donating the poor. All these things will lead him towards destruction. Not lead him, sir. He is already ruined. You have really disturbed me by giving me this news. Well, never mind. Today, I'm going to Calcutta, related to a business deal. And it is very important that I go. I'll return after few days and try to explain things to boss once again. Doctor, how is Pratima? - It is an ordinary problem. Please bring this injection. Uncle, bring this injection immediately. Rajju. - Yes, uncle? You have not eaten anything since last two days.. ..nor you have taken rest for a while. To sleep, take rest and eat is the daily routine, uncle. Chandar has not returned yet. Who else does Pratima has as her relatives? Only we. Mr. Rajan, congratulations. It's a baby boy. Baby boy! Thank you, doctor. How is Pratima? A mother forgets all her sorrows seeing the child. Look here. He is a doll! Sweet boy! Live long, dear! Live long, dear! Good morning, boss. - Oh Chandar, so you have arrived! Congratulations! Your son is exactly like you. Munna's father, first go and meet your son's mother. Go and meet your wife. Come, Mr. Dalpatram. Have a seat. How are you? I am fine, you tell me about yourself, sir. So you have come now? - I'm sorry, Pratima. The business matter had taken lead, so I was delayed. Munna is very sweet! Forget about me and Munna. First go and ask boss to eat something. He is sitting like a statue since last two days. He has not slept, taken rest or eaten anything. Boss has a habit to live for others. I'll be right back. So, how is your factory running? Not just running, Mr. Dalpatram, it is progressing. It will be defunct some day, sir. Boss, you took so much care of Pratima in my absence.. ..how should I thank you? Chandar, don't call duty as favor and insult me. If you don't mind, shall I ask you one thing? Why are you feeling shy? Go ahead. I've heard you incurred a huge loss in business. There are only two things in business, Chandar. Profit or loss! Boss, if you think with a cool mind, our factories can unite. Union of Eagle and Kabutar!? Did you hear, uncle? Chandar is saying Eagle and Kabutar brand can unite. Chandar, this Kabutar brand matchbox.. ..is the foundation of Lakshmi Mansion. And Lakshmi Mansion doesn't need anyone's support. Those who lived at Lakshmi Mansion have.. ..always given something, they never accepted a thing. The days of giving are gone, sir. Now the days to take will arrive. Mr. Dalpatram, are you aware with whom you are talking? Mr. Rajan, why this fake pride? Go and hear the talks at the market. No one is ready to buy your stuff.. ..nor is anyone ready to give you a loan. Perhaps, you may go bankrupt in few days. - Mr. Dalpatram! Mr. Rajan, don't talk with uncouth men! Remember one thing, Mr. Dalpatram. You are greedy of wealth. You have always looted wealth.. ..and I have always distributed it. And I will distribute till I breathe my last. Good morning, sir. - Good morning, boss. Give me a matchbox. - Here, sir. Eagle brand!? - What to do, boss? Wherever from we buy matchbox in the market.. ..we get only this brand. Our Kabutar brand matchbox is not available at any shop. You are unfaithful! You are disloyal! Boss, you call us anything, but don't call us disloyal. Since last 4 months we are working.. ..silently without getting our salary. If wished, we could have gone to some other factory. So this is the proof of your loyalty. There are 60 matchsticks in Kabutar brand matchbox. Instead of that, you are buying Eagle.. ..brand's matchbox with 50 matchsticks!? That too by giving one paisa more? You are being disloyal to your own master? Boss, from Kabutar brand matchbox.. ..one match stick lights while the other doesn't. But all the 50 matchsticks of Eagle brand matchbox light perfectly. Does anyone have our factory's matchbox? - Here. Now I'll see whether all the matchsticks light. Cheating! Dishonesty! Lakshmi Mansion's Kabutar brand factory is.. ..manufacturing such useless matchsticks nowadays? They are cheating the public by producing such matchsticks! I'll go right now and teach them a lesson! Foreman! Ramchand! Where have everyone gone? No one is present here! Is anyone here? Where have everyone gone? Where the heck have you all gone!? Gentlemen, according to the court order,.. ..Lakshmi Mansion and other properties of Mr. Rajan are being auctioned. The first bid of the price can start from above 2 lakhs. 3 lakhs. - 4 lakhs. 5 lakhs. - 5 lakhs one, 5 lakhs two.. 6 lakhs. - 6 1/2 lakhs. 7 lakhs. - 8 lakhs. 10 lakhs. 10 lakhs - 10 lakhs one, 10 lakhs two! 12 lakhs! 12 lakh one, 12 lakhs two. 12 lakhs one, 12 lakhs two.. 15 lakhs! - 15 lakhs! 15 lakhs one, 15 lakhs two.. ..15 lakhs one, 15 lakhs two.. 25 lakhs! 25 lakhs! 25 lakhs one, 25 lakhs two. 25 lakhs two.. 25 lakhs three! What is this? - Boss, we've purchased Lakshmi Mansion. Oh really? Congratulations. We have not purchased it for ourselves.. ..but we have brought it for you in auction. For me? - Of course. Chandar, do you think I've become handicapped? I have become lame or crippled? My hands have broken? I still have the strength to fight with life, Chandar. This house is yours. Now you stay happily in this house. Lakshmi Mansion is not ours. It belonged to you and it will always be yours. Pratima, you know me very well. Don't force me to die by giving me these alms. Do you consider us strangers now? Uncle, if you won't stay here, I'll become upset. No, Munni, don't weep. I won't let you become upset at any cost. Never think that I'll go away far from you. I'll stay in the small house adjacent to Laxmi Mansion. What!? Will you stay in that dilapidated house!? Why not? I just want a land below and sky over my head. I won't stay there for free. I will give its rent. Boss, there is a limit of being stubborn. Okay, if you consider it my stubbornness, I'll go elsewhere. Boss, as you wish. You stay in that house. Uncle Dinu, keep my clothes and stuff in the outhouse. Come, Munni. I'll show you my new house today. 'I'm giving a sighing glance to the walls of my house.' 'Live happily, people of my country, I'm just a traveler.' Uncle. - Yes? Will you stay in this house? Ghosts must be dwelling here. Dear, I am a ghost. - Stop joking. This old house is not fit for you. Please come. Munni, don't insist. You have seen God dwelling in the old temple, right? When God can dwell in the old temple.. ..why can't I live in this old house? O Almighty, what have you done!? I had given a loan of 2 lakh rupees to Chandar on 3 % interest. So that is he always indebted to me. But you made his factory prosper with my money? Chandar has made a big loss to me by returning my sum. God, why is this injustice done to me? Daddy, you are trying to flatter God? God will never be pleased by you. As you offer Him these filthy sweets made by hawkers. God! My father is a stingy man! He is a real miser! He offers you the cheapest sweets from the market. God, I've brought Cadbury-chocolate for you. Eat it, God. God, I want my husband. Whether I go for honeymoon first and get my husband later. Whether I get my husband first and honeymoon later. Anything will be fine with me, God. God, remember one thing. I've brought this chocolate for 2 rupees and 90 paisa. And my daddy's sweet ball costs only 10 paisa. Don't listen to him, God. Listen to me. Goodbye. God, please answer my prayers, okay? Bye, God! Did you see, God? She is my daughter. A loss here too! Uncle! - Oh Munni! Take this. Hey? Where from you brought this toy? Papa has brought this toy for me. Really? - Yes, uncle. Watch, it's such a strange toy. When you place it on the table it sways from here to there. It doesn't fall. Dear, this toy is an example of my life. I am such a toy. "I am such a toy." "I am such a toy." "I will sway, turn and bend either way.. ..but I will never fall. I will never fall." "I am such a toy." "I am such a toy." "I will sway, turn and bend either way.. ..but I will never fall. I will never fall." "I am such a toy." "I am such a toy." "I've seen many storms and undergone many difficulties." "I've seen many storms and undergone many difficulties." "But I didn't changed style, though the days and nights changed." "It's my heart and my wish, why should I listen to others?" "I am such a toy." "I am such a toy." "I will sway, turn and bend either way.. ..but I will never fall. I will never fall." "I am such a toy." "I am such a toy." "I don't have to take anything from anyone.. ..I have always learned to give." "I don't have to take anything from anyone.. ..I have always learned to give." "Whether anyone understands or not, my life is a style." "My smile and my tears, everything is mine." "I am such a toy." "I am such a toy." "I will sway, turn and bend either way.. ..but I will never fall. I will never fall." "I am such a toy." "I am such a toy." What's wrong, Pratima? You take the morsel to your mouth.. ..and then you bring your hand down. I wonder of the man, due to whom these dishes got cooked.. ..if that has man eaten food today. Boss is always welcome to eat food in this house. But he will never agree. You convince him. How should I cajole him? A man can tear apart the mountains, he can turn away the storms.. ..but no one can change the decision of Lakshmi Mansion's boss. Perhaps, this is the specialty of Lakshmi Mansion. Lakshmi Mansion! Boss! Boss's secretary! My wife! Life is very complicated! Life is a strange puzzle. Rajju, I've cooked only pulse and rice today. It's all right, uncle. It is the matter of times. Let it be pulse and rice, but the plate is made of silver. And this plate will come to my use when.. ..a man doesn't seek anything from anyone. Pratima! - Yes? What's wrong? You bring up some new issue every day. Instead of sleeping on the bed.. ..why are you sleeping on the ground? I'm sorry. But I can't get sleep on a soft mattress. For the man these mattresses were meant for.. ..he must be sleeping on a cot today. I'm noticing since few days, you are exaggerating the matter. Don't blame others for your deeds. Tell me once, what crime have I committed? If you wanted to do any business.. ..did you have only the option of a matchbox factory? You didn't think of anything except competing with your boss? I've done everything in front of you. And I explained to boss so often that we'll unite our factories. Who can win over a stubborn man! I have always fulfilled my duty. He's always made fun of me. Perhaps, he is jealous of my progress. I know him inside out. He can never be jealous of anyone. Now I am sure that even you are jealous of my progress. What should I do? Calm down, Munna. - What's wrong, Munni? Why is the doll weeping? I don't know, uncle. He is not ready to calm down. Oh! Come on, come to me. No.. Oh..! Watch this! Watch this! Look at this! Oh wow! Saw, Munni? Oh! He has calmed down watching the pigeon. Munna, this is uncle's pigeon. The pigeon loves uncle and uncle loves the pigeon. Pratima, why didn't you send lunch to the office today? What's wrong? - Nothing new. If not anything new, then what is the old thing? You can understand it. - I do understand. You always keep thinking that boss.. ..owned a matchbox factory, now I own it too. First he had a car, now I too have one. First boss used to live in Lakshmi Mansion.. ..now I live in it. At first, boss was the Mayor of this city.. ..and now I'm going to become the Mayor. Not only the world; now my wife is also jealous of my success. Why are you getting angry? I'm asking justice for such a man who is God for us. You know that he is heartbroken. At least go once and ask him what problem he has. Pratima, it will be useless for me to go there. When a man is disappointed, sometimes a few words of.. ..sympathy also hurts him very much. Seeing me, boss will think, at one time we were.. ..dependant on him and today we are so wealthy. There is no harm for you to go there. You can't blame him sitting at home. I don't know where I am trapped! Sometimes I think, just to make me jealous a haughty.. ..man has started living in ruins abandoning a palace. Pratima, I can see your fiery glance. This house has become a heck for me. If I stay on in this house, I'll burn in fire of this hell! Sir, shall I bring tea and grilled sandwich? - No. Bring one whiskey. - Whiskey? Sir, you used to only have tea and sandwich earlier but today.. Don't argue. Go and bring what I've ordered. - Okay. Bring one more. - Okay. Bring the entire bottle. Rajju! - What's the matter, uncle? I've heard Chandar's got appointed as the corporation Mayor. Really? It is good news. Dear Rajju, you were the Mayor for five years. Now the people have forgotten you. It is true. The world worships the rising sun. Uncle, whether the sun rises or sets, it remains a sun. It is a matter of times, dear. Even we had good times. Uncle, the man who only knows to give.. ..you shouldn't remind him when he can't. And a new Mayor is appointed every year. No one owns this world. Its nice that Chandar got appointed as the Mayor. He is our dear one. Our dear one is appointed after all. Uncle, Pratima will be so happy hearing this. A wife has a big share in husband's honour and fame. Even an empty bottle of wine was never spotted in Lakshmi Mansion. My friends forced me to give a party at Lakshmi Mansion.. ..in the good news of becoming a Mayor. Shall I call them at home and serve them lemon juice? What effect will all this have on our children? Mind your own business and let me do my work. Cheers! - Cheers!

"The atmosphere is pleasant and occasion is good." Stop it! This is a house and not a club! Chandar, you have reached the heck so soon after being successful? This is Lakshmi Mansion, Chandar. People used to wash their feet before entering this house. And today you are flowing wine over here!? Prostitutes never danced here, venerations were held. Yagya (large scale veneration) was offered. Donations were distributed. This house is a temple. The souls of my ancestors reside here. People like you are not fit to stay in this house. Get out of here! Mr. Rajan, in your fit of anger you've forgotten.. ..that this house doesn't belong to you. And in front of whom you are humiliating me, they are my friends. Those who make others go astray for their self-interest.. ..they can never be good friends. Mr. Rajan, I used to respect you till now. Today, you are humiliating me in my own house. Get lost from here silently. What's going on? You have forgotten humanity getting drunk? We can't repay his favors for many births. You have become rich overnight. His forefathers had worked hard for years and became wealthy. You touch boss's feet and apologize. - Oh shut up! Boss's pet! Boss's darling! Chandar, you raised hand on Pratima!? You raised hand on your wife!? You raised hand on your child's mother!? You miscreant! Boss! Papa! - I am not your father. Rani! Let's go, friends. We are demons and this is a temple. Chandar! - Let's go. Chandar! Why did you come here? Why did I come here? You are saying this!? You are saying this, Pratima!? I am sorry. I came to a wrong place. Forgive me. Boss, please don't misunderstand me. Nowadays, I can't differentiate between right and wrong. You have made me aware. I will never step in this house again. Another relation is broken. - Boss! Rani! Oh God! Uncle! Give me water. - I'll get it right now. What's wrong, dear? - Such days have arrived, uncle. Today, Pratima told me why I went to her house? Pratima said this!? Yes, uncle, I could've never thought she'll utter such words. I will never go there. The circumstances are not in my favor. I won't stay here a minute anymore, uncle. You pack the luggage immediately. Boss! Rani is seriously injured due to the fall. You please come immediately. No. I will never step in that house. She is lying unconscious. Munni has become unconscious? - Yes. The thing which I leave once, I never turn back and look at it. I will not go to that house. Oh God! Now who will save my daughter? Where will I run with her all alone? Where has Chandar gone? - He must be at the club. Mummy! Uncle.. First I thought it is an ordinary wound. Now I've come to know that she has received a.. ..serious injury on the delicate part of the brain. Perhaps some vein has burst. It is impossible to operate her. Stop it, Chandar. Come home immediately. Munni has received serious injury. She is lying unconscious. She is lying unconscious? Rani is very fortunate, boss. I'm in my senses, in spite of being drunk. Come with me. What's wrong, Chandar? Yes? What happened? You were such a good man, so sincere. What after all is that thing which made you a drunkard? Do you think I drink wine for my happiness, boss? I drink to forget my sorrows. You know I was a hard working and a simple man. You have brought me to this stage, boss! You! What are you saying? - I am right. You have become a pauper by.. ..distributing wealth and alms to this world. I've become a very big man accepting wealth from this world. Because of this wealth, today, between you and me.. ..between me and my wife, there is a lot of hatred, boss. Boss, take my entire wealth. Take back Lakshmi Mansion. And hire me again as an employee and a servant. I was very happy during those days, boss. I was very happy. Chandar! Boss, I don't want anything. I just want peace. I just want peace. I have understood, Chandar. I've understood everything. You don't worry. Everything will be all right. Come home first. One gets peace of heart at home. With your wife and kids. Come. Doctor, how is Rani? - Sorry, I was unable to save her. Boss! 'Munni, you have also left me?' Boss, Rani uttered only your name till she breathed her last. Come and see Rani's face. You won't step in this house even now? Won't you kiss Rani's cold forehead? - No. I just want to remember Munni's smiling face. Rani, my daughter! "Which has rains, beloved and swings too." "Which has rains, beloved and swings too." "I wonder where there is such a fair in this world." "I wonder where there is such a fair in this world." "The entire world seems a death tomb to me." "O' life, now I am afraid of your name." "O' life, now I am afraid of your name." 'Munni!' Dear Rajju, the dead ones never return. Keep patience. I know you won't like to stay at Lakshmi Mansion. You won't be able to stay there, dear. Rajju, please listen to me. Many years back, you had got a hut built for me. Let us go and stay there. I know you won't stay for free. Dear, do one thing. Give me some rent every month. Yes. I'll definitely give. - Let's go, dear. Uncle Dinu, these are my ancestors' tombstones. Munni is also buried here. Sir! - Yes? Postman. Come. Sir, are you Mr. Rajan? - Yes, why? Sir, there is a parcel for you. Please sign here. Sir, I got your address with great difficulty. Okay, sir! - Wait a minute. Here. Thank you, sir. Greetings. - Greetings! Uncle Dinu! 'A doll!?' 'Uncle Dinu, remind me while going to office today.' 'I'll order a musical doll for my Munni from Japan.' 'What is that, uncle? - Dear, that is a very beautiful doll.' 'It sings even.' What happened, Rajju? Are you all right, dear? Rajju. Rajju, you take it inside. Uncle Dinu. - Yes, Rajju? Here, keep it carefully. - What does it contain, dear? It contains my letter. Read it later. And do as I have written in the letter. - Okay, dear. Boss! - Oh! Pratima!? Come. Sit. You please don't take trouble. How are you? - I am fine. Uncle Dinu. - What's the matter, dear? Come and see who has come. - Oh! Dear Pratima? Dear, are you all right? - Yes, uncle Dinu, I am fine. But boss's health seem unwell.. Pratima, I'm very happy for you have come here. Many days had passed since I saw you. The days pass somehow. Well, forget it. First tell me, what will you have? Whatever I eat is given by you only. Forget about morning and evening. Right now, you are a guest in this house. A guest? Yes, I am a guest after all. To tell the truth, I'm very hungry. I won't leave without eating food. Now that's like a good girl. Uncle Dinu, go and cook a luscious lunch for Pratima. Rajju.. - What's wrong? Go now. Please come here. I want to tell you something. I'll be right back. What's the matter, uncle Dinu? Dear, you invited her to eat food.. ..but there is no food-grain in the house. Not only that, perhaps, there are no spices even. I've always given to the world, am I defeated today? Uncle Dinu! Rajju! - Yes, uncle. Go immediately. Pratima, how did you come here today? Beggar always comes to the master's place to take something. I needed something. So I've come to take it. From me? Whatever I've taken, I've taken it from you. You have never refused me. And you won't refuse today either. Dear Rajju. - Yes, please come. You eat food, I'll be right back. Come, dear. 'O God, Pratima has come to ask something from me.' 'What if she asks something which I'm unable to give?' 'Please help me.' Perhaps, the pickle is very hot. Dear, drink water. Pratima, how did you like the food? God's offering is always good. Yes. Now tell me, what did you need? Boss, Rani is no more alive. Pratima, don't remind me of Munni and relive my memories. Even Munna is not keeping well for past few days. His fever doesn't recede. He doesn't feel hungry or thirsty. He just keeps murmuring. What do the doctors say? Does Chandar takes care of him? Well.. what do you want from me? You must remember. You had gifted a golden pigeon on our wedding. - Yes. Munna used to play with that pigeon. When Rani was alive, she had taken Munna.. ..in your courtyard to play with your real pigeon. Now Munna is lying unconscious and insisting on it. 'I want uncle's pigeon. I want the real pigeon.' Even the doctor says that if he gets the real pigeon.. ..Munna will recover completely. Pigeon? 'O God! You have snatched away everything from me one by one.' 'Everything was given by you.' 'Whoever asked for help from me till now, I never refused.' 'Today, I will have to refuse Pratima.' 'Take me away from this world before I do that.' 'Give me death, O' God!' 'You have given me a magnificent life.' 'Give me a magnificent death too!' What happened, boss? Uncle Dinu, why did boss go away? Dear, you won't understand. You have asked such a thing from Mr. Rajan.. ..which he can't give you at any cost. I've just asked for a pigeon.. ..because Munna wants to play with it. Dear, you don't know. When you came here.. ..Mr. Rajan asked you to eat food. He didn't know there is no food at home. He whispered to me, 'Go to the market, sell the pigeon.. ..and bring food for Pratima.' Uncle Dinu! - That pigeon is already sold. Dear, such a great man was destined to see such a day!? Till today, I had a lot of faith in God. Dear, now I've lost faith in God! I've lost faith in Him. What happened? What happened, dear Rajju? Get up! Rajju! Rajju! - Boss? Rajju! Uncle Dinu! What happened to boss!? Boss? Uncle Dinu! Dear, see God's injustice. He snatched away such a splendid man so soon! Dear Rajju! Boss? Pratima, what happened to boss? He is no more. Boss! Pratima, his hand is not straight while dying. It seems he is still giving something to someone. Boss never accepted any help from me till he was alive. I will meet all the expenses of his funeral rites. I will meet all the expenses, Pratima. No, Chandar, your wish can't be fulfilled. Read my son Rajan's letter. 'I can see that my end is near.' 'I've never asked anything from anyone all my life.' 'I won't ask even after my death.' 'I had some money left after selling the silver plate.' 'I am leaving that behind.' 'Perform my funeral rites only with that money.' 'No one has the right in this world to add even.. ..one stick in my funeral pyre with his money.' 'My second wish is, my funeral pyre.. ..should be burned by Munni's side. Rajan!'
