REPORTER 1: An article, which I believe appeared in a newspaper, asked why, since it would seem that you are in effect the mayor of Chicago, you've not simply been appointed to that position. (REPORTERS CHUCKLING) Well, I tell you, you know, it's touching. Like a lot of things in life, we laugh because it's funny, and we laugh because it's true. Some people say, reformers here say, "Put that man in jail, what does he think he is doing?" What I hope I'm doing, and here's where your English paper's got a point, is I'm responding to the will of the people. People are gonna drink. You know, I know, we all know that. And all I do is act on that. And all this talk of bootlegging. What is bootlegging? On the boat, it's bootlegging. On Lake Shore Drive, it's hospitality. (REPORTERS LAUGHING) I'm a businessman. REPORTER 2: And what of your reputation that you control your business with violence? That those that don't purchase your products are dealt with violently? It's all right. I grew up in a tough neighbourhood. We used to say, "You can get further with a kind word and a gun "than you can with just a kind word." (REPORTERS LAUGHING) And in that neighbourhood, it might've been true. And sometimes your reputation follows you. There is violence in Chicago, of course, but not by me and not by anybody I employ, and I'll tell you why. Because it's not good business. BARTENDER: Leave us alone down here, we're getting along fine. We've got everything we need. The green beer you're peddling just ain't any good. Well, it ain't supposed to be good. It's supposed to be bought. I'm not buying any. Don't worry about it, Pops, we won't come back. - How's everyone at your house today? - They're fine. - Is your mama well? - She has a little cold. Oh, she does? -I'm sorry to hear that. - But she'll be all right. - There you go. - Thank you. That's all right, sweetie. You be careful crossing the street. - Mister! Mister! - You tell your mama that... Hey, mister! Wait! Mister! Wait! You forgot your brief... (WOMAN SCREAMING) Yes, I heard it on the radio. I know. Now it's time to go to work. Go make a good first impression. I love you, Eliot. Now shoo. Eliot Ness, special agent of the Treasury Department. - Mr Ness. - Thank you, Chief. At the request of the city of Chicago, the federal government, specifically the Department of the Treasury, has inaugurated a programme to deal with the flow of illegal liquor and the violence which it creates. Mr Ness! Of what does this programme consist? I and other agents of the Treasury will be working with the Chicago Police... Isn't this just another showpiece programme? - What do you think about prohibition? - Do you drink, Mr Ness? (REPORTERS LAUGHING) Come on, Mr Ness, answer the questions. It's not just a showpiece. And I'll tell you exactly how I feel about prohibition. It is the law of the land. Do you consider yourself a crusader, Mr Ness, is that it? What special qualifications do you have for the job? Do you have any political ambitions? All right, boys, I think that'll be enough. - One more shot, Mr Ness. - Excuse me. Mr Ness, what are your real plans? What have you got coming up? You'll just have to read about it in the paper. - Let me ride along with you. - No. Can't help you. Mr Ness, Lieutenant Alderson, the Flying Squad. Are you ready to meet the men? Yes, I am. I have one more thing to say. I know that many of you take a drink. What you've done before today is not my concern. But now we must be pure, and I want you to stop. It's not a question of whether or not it's a harmless drink. It may well be. But it's against the law, gentlemen. And as we are going to enforce the law, we must do first by example. Are there any questions? Good. The Department of the Treasury's had a man undercover for some time now. We've received word from this informant that a very large shipment of Canadian whisky has arrived in Chicago. So I hope that you've signed on for some action, men, because you're going to get it. Remember, the liquor cases are marked with the red maple leaf. Yes, sir, I have it. The Treasury agent is in a grey suit with a white scarf. - He is not to be arrested. - A grey suit and a white scarf. - I think that's it. Are your men ready? - Yes, sir. They are. Good. - At ease. - Smoke them if you got them. - How are we doing? - Okay. - Want part of a sandwich? - No, thank you, sir. - You nervous? - No, sir. - Been with the unit long? - A short while. - I suppose we all want to do well. - Yes, sir. A message from my wife. - You married? - Yes, sir, I am. Nice to be married, huh? Just follow me. (DOG BARKING) - Oh, God... - Federal officer. Hands in the air. Get them up. Drop it. I can't. I can't, it'll break. Mr Ness. Look, I was just... Jeez, I'm sorry. Listen. Listen, I can do a lot for you, a lot for what you're trying to do. I get the big scoop when you make a big splash. Get yourself some support. What do you say? Let's be real, let me help you. What do you say? Okay. Just shut up. All right now... Let's do some good! (OFFICER CHATTERING) Hold it right there! Federal officer. You're under arrest for violations of the Volstead Act. - Are all the doors covered? - Let's cover the doors! Don't let anybody out! Preseuski. - Excuse me, I'm here with permission. - Who gave you permission? - Mr Ness! -Lt's all right, let him through here. Let him through here. You want to take your picture, take it now. - You ready? - Ready. Liquor, huh? Is it raining? - Get him out of here. - Come on. - Tear the place apart! - I mean now, get him out! Yes, sir! Go to the back. Let's try to find what we're after. That means you too. Christ! Now, what do you think you're doing? You want to throw your garbage? Throw it in the goddamn trash basket. Don't you have more important things to do? Yeah. But I'm not doing them right now. Do we understand each other? Okay, pal, why the Mohaska? - Why are you packing the gun? -I'm a Treasury officer. All right. Just remember what we talked about, now. Hey... Wait a minute! What the hell kind of police do you have in this goddamn city, huh? You just turned your back on an armed man. - You're a Treasury officer. - How do you know? I just said I was. Who would claim to be that, who was not? What's your name and unit? It's right here. You got a beef? What is it? How did you know I had a gun? What do you want, a free lesson in police work? No. Are you okay, pal? I had a rough day on the job. - Are you going home now? - I was about to. Well, then, you just fulfilled the first rule of law enforcement. Make sure when your shift is over you go home alive. Here endeth the lesson. You've got $100,000 there for 40 barrels. Make sure there are no empties. I'm gonna give you the ledger, everything is in the book. Fifty-five gallons to a barrel. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) -Lt's Eddie. - Come in, Eddie. So he gets into the snowplough, and he says, "Let's do some good." And then, we bust through... - Mr Ness? - Yes? I came here to thank you. It was my little girl that got killed with that bomb. I'm sorry. Please. I'm... I'm so sorry. You see, it's... Because I know that you have children too. And that this is real for you, that these men cause us tragedy. And I know that you will put a stop to them. And now, you do that, now. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) - What do you want? -I'd like to talk to you. (BABY CRYING) Come in. What I need is a small group of men, hand picked, starting with you. Ness! I am just a poor beat cop. Now, how can I help you? Just work with me. - But why should I, though? - Because you're a good cop. - How do you know that? - You told me. I'm such a good cop, how come I'm walking the beat, then, at my age? Well, do you want to tell me? Well, maybe I'm that whore with a heart of gold. The one good cop in the bad town? Now, is that what you want to hear? I didn't ask you, and I don't care! You want to stay on the beat? You do that. If you'd like to come with me, I need your help. I'm asking you for help. Well, that's the thing you fear, isn't it? Mr Ness, I wish I'd met you 10 years and 20 pounds ago. But I just think it got more important to me to stay alive. And that's why I'm walking the beat. Thank you, no. AMOS ON RADIO: That's good, Andy. Let's start up the thing here and take a little ride. I wanna hear that Stutz Bearcat engine, boy! - Yeah, let me open the door here. - Yeah, go ahead. Whoopsy daisy, pick up the door there, Andy. Throw it in the back seat. Now, let me get the thing started. Yeah, start it up, Andy. (ENGINE STARTING) Holy mackerel, Andy! Listen to that Bearcat motor! Yeah, it sounds like the bear is chasing that cat ail around it! Andy! She's boiling over! - Mr Ness? - Yes. Oscar Wallace. I've been assigned here by the Washington bureau. - Really? - Yes. Well, I'm glad to have you here, Mr Wallace. Would you excuse me? We are a little in the dark here, but any ideas you may have... Well, actually, yes, sir, I do. And the one I want to try first is this. He has not filed a return since 1926. - A return? - An income tax return. -Income tax. - Yes, sir. What do you do at the bureau, Mr Wallace? Oh, I'm an accountant. - An accountant? - Yes, and the bureau sent me here... Would you excuse me? Please. Okay, let's go. - Where are we going? - These walls have ears. You said you wanted to know how to get Capone. Do you really want to get him? You see what I'm saying? What are you prepared to do? - Everything within the law. - And then what are you prepared to do? If you open the ball on these people, Mr Ness, you must be prepared to go all the way. Because they won't give up the fight until one of you is dead. I want to get Capone. I don't know how to get him. You want to get Capone? Here's how you get him. He pulls a knife, you pull a gun. He sends one of yours to the hospital, you send one of his to the morgue! That's the Chicago way! And that's how you get Capone. Now, do you want to do that? Are you ready to do that? I'm making you a deal. Do you want this deal? I have sworn to put this man away, with any and all legal means at my disposal, and I will do so. Well, the Lord hates a coward. Do you know what a blood oath is, Mr Ness? - Yes. - Good. Because you just took one. How do you think Capone knew about your raid the other night? - Somebody on the cops told him. - Right. Welcome to Chicago. This town stinks like a whorehouse at low tide. The first thing is, who can you trust? Nobody. The cops, nobody. - Because nobody wants you here. - Well, then why are you helping me? Because I swore to uphold the law. And if you believe that, I'll tell you another. Now, who can you trust? - I can trust nobody. - That's the sorry truth. Well, if I can trust nobody, where are we gonna get help? If you're afraid of getting a rotten apple, don't go to the barrel. Get it off the tree. Get it off the tree... Finger out of the trigger guard! Eject those cartridges! Lay the revolver on the ledge and stand back! About face! Barry! I want you to meet Mr Eliot Ness. - Yeah. - Treasury Department. How are you? We need a recruit for extended duty. Now, this man is to be seconded to the Treasury Department. We have the full cooperation of... Barry? Who is consistently the best shot of this class? - Williamson and Stone. - Good. Well, call them out for me, will you? But one at a time. - Are either of the men married? - No. - Good. - Williamson! - You're married. - Front and centre! I don't want any married men. All right, stand easy, son. I want to ask you something. Why do you want to join the force? - To protect and... - Yeah? To protect and serve... To protect and... Please don't search for the yearbook answer. Just tell me what you think. - What I think? I... - You... -...could help with the force. - I see. - You can help... - With the force. - With crime. - Thank you. There goes the next chief of police. At ease! Stone! Out here. This kid's a prodigy. Why do you want to join the force? To protect the property and... Oh, please, don't waste my time with that bullshit. Where are you from, Stone? - From the Southside. - Stone? George Stone, that's your name? - What's your real name? - That is my real name. No! What was it before you changed it? - Giuseppe Petri. - Jeez, I knew it! That's all you need, one thieving wop on the team! What's that you said? I said that you're a lying member of a no-good race. That's much better than you, you stinking Irish pig. Oh, I like him. Yeah, I like him too. You just joined the Treasury Department, son. Yeah, okay. Eliot Ness. With reports from stakeouts on the North and Westside, and... Thank you, Lieutenant. Thank you. - What do you think? - I think there's nothing like vaudeville. - That's what I think. - Now, are you ready to go to work? - Where are we going? - On a liquor raid. We need another man. Mr Ness? This is very interesting. I've found a financial disbursement pattern which shows some... - You carry a badge? - Yes. Carry a gun. - Jimmy? - What? What the hell are you dressed for? Halloween? - Shut up. I'm working. - Where? The circus? - Well, here we are. - What are we doing here? Liquor raid. Here? Mr Ness, everybody knows where the booze is. The problem isn't finding it. The problem is who wants to cross Capone. Let's go. You'd better be damn sure, Malone. If you walk through this door now, you're walking into a world of trouble. And there's no turning back. Do you understand? Yes, I do. Good. Give me that axe. - Federal officers! - Get your hands in the air! - Nobody move! - This is a raid! - Everybody... - What are you doing here? All this stuff is impounded! You're all under arrest! Hey! This isn't right! Hey! This is no good! - You got a warrant? - Sure! Here's my warrant. (EXCLAIMS) How do you think he feels now? Better? Or worse? - What is that? - What is that? - Yes, what is it? - God, I'm with a heathen. That is my call-box key and that is St Jude. Santo Jude. He's the patron saint of lost causes. And policemen. Patron saint of policemen? Everybody needs a friend. Lost causes, policemen... Which do you want to be? - I want to be a cop. - You do? - Yes. - Why? To protect the property and the citizenry... Whoa, it's all right. What? I just gotta hand it to you, congratulations! It's okay if I get a picture of you and your men? Yeah. But not for publication. Just for us. Anything you say, Mr Ness. Closer in... Oh, that's great. Okay, ready? Hold it. Life goes on. (GUESTS LAUGHING) A man becomes preeminent, he's expected to have enthusiasms. Enthusiasms... Enthusiasms... What are mine? What draws my admiration? What is that which gives me joy? - Dames! - Music! - Opera! - Booze! Baseball! A man... A man stands alone at a plate. This is the time for what? For individual achievement. There he stands alone. But in the field, what? Part of a team. - Teamwork. Teamwork. - Teamwork. Looks, throws, catches, hustles. Part of one big team. (ALL AGREEING) Bats himself the livelong day, Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb and so on. If his team don't field, what is he? - Nothing. - Nothing. You follow me? No one. Sunny day, the stands are full of fans. What does he have to say? I'm going out there for myself. But I get nowhere unless the team wins. - Team ! - Team. Jesus Christ! Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep. If I should die before I wake, I pray the Lord my soul to take. - Amen. - And God bless you. God bless Mommy, God bless Daddy, God bless Dolly. Amen. Amen. - Good night. - Good night. - Good night, Daddy. - Good night, little girl. Want to rub Eskimo? Butterfly? - Where are you going? - What? Where are you going? I thought I'd go downstairs, some work to do for tomorrow. - You had a full day today, didn't you? - Yes, I certainly did. - And you've still got some energy left? - Oh, a lot of work. Well, why don't you come up and brush my hair, you detective? - How are we doing? - Capone's organisation is diverse. It owns Canadian holding company associations, which owns, in turn, Green Light Laundry, Midwest Cabs, Jolly Time Playthings... - Jolly Time Playthings? - Yes. Jolly Time Playthings. Remind me to get a present for my daughter. Bahama Ship-to-Shore, Miss Lucy... The list is endless! And all the business is legitimate, and none of it is owned by Al Capone. But we can get him on income tax evasion if we can just show that any of the money from the organisation business is going to him. - Legally, he receives no income. - He doesn't receive anything? Excuse me, Mr Ness? You have a visitor. - Mr Ness. -I'm Ness. Could we talk for a minute? John O'Shea, Alderman, 43rd Ward. Yes, Alderman, I know who you are. Would you excuse us? We have several large operations in the works. We're rather busy, so, what can I do for you? I came up to congratulate you on a job well done. Share your good fortune on such a lovely day. What's that? (CHUCKLES) - What is that? - Mr Ness, you're an educated man. Let me pay you the compliment of being blunt. There is a large and popular business which you are causing dismay. Why don't you just cross the street and let things take their course? Would you come in here, please? In Roman times, when a fellow was convicted of trying to bribe a public official, they would cut off his nose and sew him in a bag with a wild animal, and throw that bag in the river. You tell your master that we must agree to disagree! - You're making a mistake. - Yeah? I'm beginning to enjoy them. You fellows are untouchable, is that the thing? No one can get to you? - You tell Capone... - Hey, everyone can be gotten to. ...that I'll see him in hell. Hey! Nice house! I said, nice house! Do you live there? Little girl's having a birthday, huh? Yes. Nice to have a family. Yes, it is. A man should take care, see that nothing happens to them. Catherine! Catherine! - Where's the baby? - She's upstairs. Eliot! No. Oh, you. - What were you doing up? - I had to finish my ironing. You did? You're gonna come with Daddy now, okay? Eliot? Okay, it's all right! Okay, let's go. Stay there! Keep your eye on the street. - Where's Malone? - On the stakeout. He'll be right here. - Who's this guy? - He's on his list. He's all right. All right, then. Drive them to the station. She'll tell you where to go when you get there. Take off your hat. Anything happens, shoot first. You understand me? Yes, Mr Ness. Kiss. - Eskimo and butterfly, Dad. - Okay. NOW, go! Malone! - Are they okay? - They're fine. - Are you sure the cop's okay? - Well, he better be, he's my cousin. I want to hurt the man, Malone! You hear me? I want to start taking the battle to him. I want to hurt Capone. Well, then, Merry Christmas, because we've got some great news. Tell him. There's gonna be a huge international shipment coming. We've got the time, the place and the whole shebang. Well, what are we doing standing here, then? - How do you come by this information? - That's the second rule of police work. If you want to keep a secret, don't tell the boss. You know he's making over $3 million a year? But he's paid no taxes, nothing's in his name. If we can establish any payments to him at all, we can prosecute him for income tax evasion. What? I said, we can prosecute him for income tax evasion. Try a murderer for not paying his taxes? Well, it's better than nothing. All right. How do we link him to the money? I don't know. Go to sleep, Oscar. (HORSE NEIGHING) A convoy of five to ten trucks filled with your good Canadian whisky will be met by a high-level member of the Capone organisation. He will be bringing full payment for this shipment in cash. Now, the meet is to take place just over the border on the American side. Our aim will be to confiscate the liquor and the cash. - Captain? - We will await their signal. When they are on the road and have given the signal, we will engage from the Canadian side of the bridge. Thus taking them by surprise from the rear. And surprise, as you very well know, Mr Ness, is half the battle. Surprise is half the battle. Many things are half the battle. Losing is half the battle. Let's think about what is all the battle. Let's take the fight to them, gentlemen! Thank you, Captain. All right! Move out! Take it easy. Take it easy. It'll all happen in time. This is the job. Don't wait for it to happen, don't even want it to happen. Just watch what does happen. Are you my tutor? Yes, sir, that I am. - Did you check it already? - Yes, I did. Then leave it alone. You're a good cop, Giuseppe. You're doing good. You're gonna do just fine. - Wallace, are you cold? - Yes, I am, a little. Then stamp your feet. It'll keep you warm. You learn something, 20 years walking the beat. Snitches and standing in the rain... Listen, Mr Ness... I had an idea. (SHUSHING) MALONE: You all have your spare shells? If you have to fire, hold low and squeeze. And put your man down. Because he'd do the same to you. Shoot to kill. - Did you hear what I said? - Yes, I did. Shoot to kill. Let's go. Easy... The Canadians will not show until I flash the badge. So it's imperative we cross the ground to the bridge as quickly as possible. George, it looks okay. The count's right. It's not the count, I'm concerned about the size of these barrels. Malone, you and I will take the... (GUNSHOT) (SPEAKING IN ITALIAN) Move it! Move it, Georgie! Come on! - Get over here! - Open the truck! Leave the stuff! Charge! What the hell! You gotta die of something. - Look! Here they come! - Fucking Mounties! Let's go! - Let's get out of here! Come on! - Move, come on! Let's go! I can't believe it! - Here! The book! - Give me that. Don't let those cars off the bridge! - Cover him! - Go! Georgie, run to the car! (LAUGHING) (WHOOPS) - Stone, take the first car! - Got it! Get this thing out of the way! - Let's go! - Move! Come on, shoot! Tough guy! Stone! Go! Stone! I'm okay. You thugs! You all right? Yeah. There he is! Go get him! All right! Enough of this running shit! Well, Georgie-boy! Well, what have we got here? Hello. (EXCLAIMING) (HAND GRENADE RATTLING ON ROOF) All right! Drop the gun! Put your hands in the air, you're under arrest. I said, drop it! Stop! God, didn't you hear what I said? What are you, deaf? What is this, a game? Here. Sit down. Well, Stone's gonna be all right. I got the fellow with the satchel. - I had to kill him. - Oh, yeah. He's as dead as Julius Caesar. - Would you rather it was you? - No, I would not. Well, then you've done your duty. Go home and sleep well tonight. Well, the things you see when you're out without your gun. Now, you're a long way from the Southside, George. I'm talking to you. Did you come here to open a shooting gallery? I want you to write down the names of your superiors and contacts. - Why don't you kiss my ass. - Hey! - All right. Perhaps you didn't hear me. - WALLACE: Eliot? You fired on federal officers. You've broken the law. You can be tough in Leavenworth for 30 years. - You're going inside for all day! -ls that what you want? - Eli0't! - What? Look at this! - Look at this! - What is this? What is this? You got a lot of money changing hands in this book. What is this, "Ward"? And "police precincts"? You got a heading here, "Circuit Court". You got a heading here, "Circuit Court". What is this? Nothing. There's nothing you can make out of it. If we can establish any of these coded entries indicate payment to Capone, then we can put Capone away. Tell us which one of these entries is Al Capone. A. Costa, is that his code name? You'll do the whole thing in the joint unless you help us. I want you to translate this ledger for us! - In hell. - In hell? You're mucking with the G, here, pal. You'll hang high unless you cooperate. This man can finger Al Capone. This man can put Capone behind bars. Why don't you guys just fuck off. I'm not fucking with you! We'll have that information one way or another. - Not that way. Out. - You're gonna talk! You're gonna be begging to talk! Because somebody's gonna talk! - You dirty son of a bitch! - Enough out of you. Hey, come on, you, on your feet! I need you to help me to translate this book! And I'm not gonna ask you a second time. I'm gonna count to three. What's the matter? Can't you talk with a gun in your mouth? One. Two. Three! I'm gonna talk! Don't! I'm gonna tell you whatever you want. What do you want to know? And don't let him clean himself until after he talks. Now, ask him what you want to know. All right... Okay, I want to know the name of the bookkeeper. I want a complete translation of the code. I want complete information. Mr Ness! A. Costa. Now, is that Al Capone? It's Al Capone. I do not approve of your methods. Yeah? Well, you're not from Chicago. - What? - They got the shipment. - What? - They got the whole shipment. - I want that son of a bitch dead! - We're trying to locate... What am I, alone in this world? Did I ask you what you're trying to do? No, Al. Please. I want you to get this fuck where he breathes! Find this Nancy boy, Ness. I want him dead! I want his family dead! I want his house burnt to the ground! I wanna go there at night, I wanna piss on his ashes! Look at this guy, this guy, he's so serious. - Well, he's got a lot on his mind. - He does? - Yes. - Like what? Like what his name is. "John", I thought that was all settled. "John", I thought we liked "John". And I suppose his middle name will be "Law". No, it'll be "Edgar". - It'll be "J. Edgar"... - I don't think so. God, you're beautiful. You should have seen us last night. I know. I should have been here. I wanted to be here. I know. I understand, I do. - Just tell me, are you being careful? - Careful as mice. Are you making progress? - Progress? - Yes? Mrs Ness, I think your husband just became the man who got Al Capone. Gentlemen! A subpoena was issued for Alphonse Capone by my office this morning, for the crime of evading and conspiring to evade federal income tax. What's the maximum he could get? If convicted on all counts, Mr Capone could have up to 28 years. - For a murderer? - Excuse me, that's all. Thank you. (REPORTERS CHATTERING) Okay, now, here we go. The car's in the alley. When you get him, don't answer the phone. - We're gonna call, gonna let it ring... - Twice. - We'll call... - From the corner. - Anybody knocks on the door... - Come out shooting. I got it. You kind of enjoy the tactical aspects of law enforcement, Oscar? Much more diverting than accounting. I'm being good to you, you gotta be good to me. We made a deal, we're gonna stick to it, okay? Oh, yes, much more diverting than accounting. - Okay, we see youse tonight. - Yeah. Okay. All right, all the way down and no stops. ...he can say, "I will speak up." For which I must commend the excellent work of Eliot Ness and his squad of Untouchables. - What was it, a boy or a girl? - Boy. A boy, congratulations! What's his name? - John. - John? Yeah. John James. - So she's okay? - Yeah, she's okay. In fact, when she gets out, she wants to repaint the whole house. When she's done, she'll find the house too small, you'll have to move. Exactly. - Goodness, it's nice to be married. - If you can stand the pain. Mr Burns, where's Mr Wallace? Didn't you see him? He just went down in the service elevator. Okay, good. - You keep an eye out at all times... - Take it easy, everything will be fine. They are going to send someone... (GUNSHOT) - Did he say the service elevator? - Yes. - Wallace! Wallace! - Here, let's take the stairs. Oh, no. - No, no! - Easy... Easy! Oscar. Oh, Jesus. You gonna be all right? (REPORTERS CLAMOURING) Mr Ness! It's always a crime when a young guy goes down in the line, Jimmy. I'd hate to see it happen to someone I know. Sometimes it's better not to get involved. Jimmy. Take a day off. Get out of the city for a while. You know what I mean? - Al Capone. - We have no Mr Capone... I know, get him. - We have no Mr Capone... - I said, goddamn it... I said... - Something you want here? - My friend was killed today. - I don't care. - You don't care. Now he does. Come out here, Capone. You want to fight? You and me, right here? That's it, come on! You afraid to come out from behind your men, to stand up for yourself? You wanna do it now? You wanna go to the mat now? Come on, you guinea son of a bitch! - What? - Easy. You talk to me like that in front of my son? Fuck you and your family! Easy. It's me. It's me! Not this way. Not this way. You fuck, you got nothing! You're nothing but talk and a badge. You're here because you got nothing. Nothing in court, you don't got the bookkeeper, you've got nothing! Nothing! If you were a man, you would've done it now! You don't got a thing, punk! Well, no, I understand. Believe me, I understand. Well, what's happened? He says he can't be unprotected. What is it that the guy says? He says he won't make a fool out of himself, and he won't go into court without a witness. So tomorrow morning, the DA's going to announce he's dropping the case. - He's gonna give up. - I didn't say that. I said, he will not go without a witness. We have Wallace's files and the ledgers. (PHONE RINGING) There's a time when I think you have to cut your losses. Hello? Hello. Yes. No, he didn't have a family. How is everything there? No, you do it however you want. I promise I will. You give her my love. I love you too. Mr Ness, we got a ledger here listing payments to Chicago city officials. - We got Al Capone, Frank Nitti... - I think that's enough for today. - But if we don't stay on top of them... - That'll do, Mr Stone. That'll do. - Thank you. -I'd like to request to stick around. - We gotta bust these guys. - I know we gotta. Is that it? -I'm sorry? - You heard me. My question is, are we done? Yes, I think we're done. You're saying that we sat in at a game that was above our head? It appears so. It does appear so to Mr Wallace. Well, he's dead! And the DA is gonna drop the case! Damn it, he will not go into court without a witness and he will not go to court without Capone's bookkeeper, Walter Payne. - What are you prepared to do now? - What would you have me do? I have taken this as far as it can go. - What did your wife want? - She wanted to know if I was... - My wife? - Yeah. She wanted to know if I was all right. It's nice being married, eh? Yes. She's sitting in some room surrounded by people she doesn't know, going over kitchen colour charts or something. Some part of the world still cares what colour the kitchen is. Eliot, I want you to do one more thing for me. Get back to the DA and stall him. Wait a minute, stall him? Stall him with what? Just do as I say. I think I know how to find this guy. Walter? Al says we gotta get out of town until he can fix this subpoena thing. We're leaving tonight. Two ball, down. - Mike, you got a minute? - Well, I do now, don't I? And what are you doing in a club for cops, Jim? - This is a place for cops. - Can we step outside? All right, all right, all right, but I got nothing to say to you. Where the hell are we going, for a swim? Get out of the rain, you fool. What? What? I just need one more piece of information. One more? Jimmy! - I just risked my life for you. - I need to find that bookkeeper. Are you crazy? You're crazy. I warned you to get out of town. - If they knew it was me, I'm dead. - I need to find that bookkeeper. You're fucking nuts, man! You're fucking out of your mind! You're out of your fucking mind! And I tried to save your life. Get your hands off. You owe me, Jimmy, I don't owe you nothing. - My people are being killed. - Your people? We're your people! - You're my people? - Yes. You fucking run with the dagos! Mike, they've ruined this town. For 10 years, I can't eat my food with the shit going on and say I'm a cop. Ah, bullshit! Fucking bullshit! Look at yourself! Look at yourself! Go on and live the charade, with your soft clothes and your federal stooge. What the hell do you think he's gonna do? - Keep your mouth off! -ls he gonna clean up this town? I need to know where this guy is, and I need to know now! I'm gonna rat you out for all the shit I know that you've done in your life! I'm gonna turn you over! This is a dead man talking to me, Jimmy. Is it? You're dead. (MALONE COUGHING) Who the hell do you think you are? I'll have your ass hanging from a flagpole in the morning. Let's cut the woofing, pal. You tell me, or you're going to hospital or the fucking morgue! By God, you're gonna fight this out and we'll have a case. Yes? On what basis? I'm not gonna go out on a limb or make a fool... Don't tell me about making a fool out of yourself. I have men out there risking something more than that. I'm told that we have a lead, and we are following that lead at risk to more than our standing. So don't you dare stop now. (PHONE RINGING) - Yeah, Stone. - Give me Ness. Not here, he's at the DA's. What's going on? Tell him I know where Payne is and to meet me at my place right away. - Al! Al! - Mr Capone! What about... What about that court case? I'm gonna tell you something. Somebody messes with me, I'm gonna mess with him. (ALL LAUGHING) Somebody steals from me, I'm gonna say, "You stole", not talk to him for spitting on the sidewalk. You understand? Now, I have done nothing to hurt these people, but they're angered at me. So, what do they do? Doctor up some income tax, for which they got no case, to annoy me. To speak to me like men? No. To harass a peaceful man. I pray to God that if I ever had a grievance, I would have just a little more self-respect. Mr Capone! Mr Capone! Just one more question! And I'll tell you one more thing. You got an all-out prizefight, you wait till the fight's over, one guy's left standing, and that's how you know who won. (CLICKING) Isn't that just like a wop? Brings a knife to a gunfight. Get out of here, you dago bastard! Go on, get your ass out of here! (GRUNTING IN PAIN) (BABY CRYING) (consume) (SINGING) WOMAN: Shots! Shots! There were shots up there! Stay back, everybody stay back, right now. Take the back. Malone! Malone. Goddamn! Stone! Stone! The phone! Oh, God. Call an ambulance! This is Stone, Treasury Department. 1634 Racine, I need an ambulance. - What? - Racine! This? You want this? You want this? What? - Bookkeeper. - What? - Book... - The bookkeeper? - The bookkeeper. - The bookkeeper? What? - The bookkeeper, he's on this train? - Yes. He's on this train. Now! What are you prepared to do? No. Malone. No. Stay. Stay. Stay! No, no! Not this man... Not this man... Train's leaving for Miami, 12:05, Mr Ness. We'll be there. The bookkeeper's no good to us dead. - Stone? - Yes, sir. Cover the south entrance. (CHILD SCREAMING) We're almost home. We're almost home. (MUSIC BOX PLAYING SOFT MUSIC) ANNOUNCER ON PA: Your attention, please. The Miami Flier departs at 12:05, track 33. All aboard. (WOMAN SHUSHING) Stay right there. Stay right there. Stay right there. Stay right there, honey. Oh, angel. Your attention, please.

Your attention, please. May I have your attention, please? This is the final call for the Miami Flier, leaving at 12:05 on track 33. All aboard! - Here, let me. Get your bags. - Oh, thank you so much. Thank you, sir. Are you all right? Thank you. You're such a gentleman. It's so kind of you to help me. I really wasn't sure if we'd make it or not. Is there some problem I can help you with? - No. - I really can't thank you enough. Isn't this fun? You're being such a good boy, sweetheart. Thank you again, this is so wonderful. Thank you, sir. Please, let me take him from here. You've been such a great help. Thank you so much. I'll take it from here, sir. Thank you very much for your help. Thank you, sir. Don't cry, sweetheart. We're almost home. Is something wrong? Sir? (WOMAN SCREAMING) (INAUDIBLE) Come on! Come on, let's get out of here. - What are you doing? Come on. - Shut up! I said, shut up! (BABY BABBLING) - What are you doing? - Shut the fuck up! Hold it! - Please... - Hold it. - My baby! - Stay there. He's all right. Shut up! I said, hold it! See, I'm walking out with the bookkeeper. And the bookkeeper and me are driving away. See? Or else he dies. He dies, and you ain't got nothing. You got five seconds to make up your mind. I'll tell you. -I'll tell you what you want to know! - Shut up! I'm not kidding! He's crazy! You don't have to do this, I'll tell you what you want to know! - You got him? - Yeah, I got him. - One! - Will you stop it? Take him. Two. The two coded entries in this ledger represent cash disbursement to all levels of city officials, members of the police and to Alphonse Capone. - That's correct. - Excuse me? I said, that is correct. And you will decipher these coded entries for us? I will. - Sorry, Mr Payne, I can't hear you. - I said, I will. You were in charge of disbursements for Mr Capone? Yes, I was. And you personally distributed monies vast, undeclared monies to Mr Capone? Yes, I did. Would you tell us the amounts? In a three-year period, I personally disbursed monies to Mr Capone in excess of one and a third million dollars. Would you repeat that amount, please? One and a third million dollars. Thank you very much. I don't understand it. What does Capone have? We're nailing the lid on his coffin, and he's smiling. The son of a bitch is wearing a gun in court. Get me the bailiff. It'll be a fast trial. The man in the front row wearing a white suit is carrying a gun. I don't want this to turn into something, so when you get him up, - I'll lead you out. - Yes, sir. Could we speak to you a minute, please? - Get up against it. - Who are you? You heard him. Now, up against it! What's this? Okay, empty all your pockets. On the table here, all of it. -I've got a permit for that. - Fine, let's see it. You know, I'm not the one under indictment. Everything on the table. - Let me see. - Give him his gun back. "To Whom It May Concern. Please extend to the bearer, "Mr Frank Nitti, all possible courtesy and consideration. "William Thompson, Mayor of the city of Chicago." Sorry, Mr Ness, you'll have to give it back. Fine. But that man does not go back into that courtroom. You understand me? Yes, sir. 1634 Racine. You know, I used to have a friend who lived there. Don't. Let him go. - No! - Here, take it. (GUN FIRING) (EXCLAIMING) Here I am, treasury man. Come on! Arrest me! What are you waiting for? Don't just stand there! Arrest me! Don't push me. - They're gonna burn you, buddy. - Yeah? Yeah. I'm gonna come see you burn, you son of a bitch, because you killed my friend! - He died like a pig. - What did you say? I said that your friend died screaming like a stuck Irish pig. Now, you think about that when I beat the rap. Did he sound anything like that? One picture, come on, one picture. Mr Ness, take a look at this. Mr Ness? Mr Ness, are you doing okay? I think you'd better see this. - What is it? - What is it? That's the jury list. They've been bribed. I got it out of Nitti's coat. Where is Nitti? He's in the car. This constitutes no evidence. It has no provenance. -I'm not about to allow... - Your Honour, the truth is that the man Capone is a killer, and he will go free. There is only one way to deal with such men, and that's hunt them down. I have. I have forsworn myself. I have broken laws I swore to defend. I've become what I beheld and I'm content I have done right. That man must be stopped. You must... I'll be the judge of what I must do, Mr Ness. Would you excuse us? - Bailiff. - Yes, sir. Bailiff, I want you to go next door to Judge Hoffman's court, where they've just begun hearing a divorce action. I want you to bring that jury in here and take this jury to his court. - Bailiff, are those instructions clear? - Yes, sir, they're clear. What's he talking about? What is this? Bailiff, I want you to switch the juries. - Yes, sir. - Your Honour, I object! Overruled. What did you tell him? I told him his name was in the ledger too. His name wasn't in the ledger. Wait a second. ls this the law? What's going on over here? - You're out of order. - What's going on? - I think that we have to... - I don't care. Do something here. What do I look like to you? Do something. Do something! Order! Your Honour, we'd like to withdraw our plea of not guilty and enter a plea of guilty. - Guilty? - Order in the court! Order! Guilty! - Bailiff! I said, order! - Your Honour! - Bailiff, clear the courtroom! - Your Honour! - I want some control here! - Eliot. Your Honour! Your Honour, is that justice? Please, why did he switch the jury? What are you gonna do now? Go after the organisation? Excuse me. I'm asking, Your Honour, is this justice? What about justice? Your Honour! ls this justice? Wait, wait, wait! Wait! Never stop. Never stop fighting till the fight is done. What'd he say? What are you saying? I said, never stop fighting till the fight is done. - What? - You heard me, Capone. It's over. You're nothing but a lot of talk and a badge. - Here endeth the lesson. - You're a lot of talk and a badge. You're nothing but a lot of talk and a badge! You're nothing but a lot of talk and a badge! You're nothing but a lot of talk and a badge! (CROWD SHOUTING) So much violence. Cleaning up a little. I guess this is goodbye. Goodbye, George. I want to thank you for this. No. Thank you. Mr Ness, I think he would have wanted you to have that. He'd have wanted a cop to have it. I'm going home. Mr Ness! Mr Ness, any comment for the record? "The man who put Al Capone on the spot." I just happened to be there when the wheel went round. They say they're going to repeal prohibition. What will you do then? I think I'll have a drink.
