[ominous music ♪] ♪ ♪ [narrator] 1685. Storm clouds gather over Europe. In England, the good King Charles is dead, and his brother, James II, sits on a very shaky throne. The country is torn asunder by dissenting factions; one, loyal to the last of the Stuart kings, the other, faithful to Prince William of Orange across the channel. While the Duke of Monmouth plans to raise an army, invade England, and usurp the throne from King James, the Lord High Chief Justice Jeffries dispenses his peculiarly inflexible form of justice to vast numbers of suspects, both real and imaginary. This is a time of plot and counterplot, a time of witchcraft, when the shadow of the executioner blots out... the innocent and guilty alike. We shall destroy the bloody judge, my dear, and then we shall, all of us, rejoice. [overlapping voices] [singing in foreign language] [singing continues] Alicia...

The charge, witchcraft. [overlapping chatter] Silence. [chatter continues] [chatter intensifies] Silence! Proceed, Sergeant Allan. If Your Lordship pleases, the Crown will show that this female, Alicia Gray, did, in fact, indulge in practices alien to our faith and in contempt of the existing laws of our kingdom. We shall also prove that she did, on the first day of May, frequent a place where pagan rites were carried out. That she was caught in flagrante with one certain Capple, a long-suspected practitioner of the black arts. The Crown has more than sufficient proof of witchcraft against this Capple to have him hung, drawn and quartered, as prescribed by law. But unfortunately... Unfortunately what, Mr. Prosecutor? The villain evaded capture, my Lord. He died. [laughter] If Capple is dead what is his relevance to this case? The accused female is guilty by association, my Lord.

Uh, claret, my Lord? A true Englishman's wine. By that witch, I presume you mean Alicia Gray. She was a stranger here. Besides, she was not a plotter against our good Lord the King, God bless him.

Since my Lady wife died, I see little of my son and his friends. You may be right, of course. I am right, Wessex. Barnaby knew your son. He may still know him.

Your pardon, my Lord, I thought... I thought you were alone. 'Tis unpardonable. Get out! Wait! Wait. Who is this lumpkin? It's Satchel, my Lord, my bailiff.
