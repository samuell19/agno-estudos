Film by Aleksandra Terpińska based on the novel by Dorota Masłowska. Janik, Kamil. Age 32, no record. Well, there was one misdemeanour. 216 zlotys worth of damage... He didn't show up for community service... Will instant karma hunt him down? Grey faces. People here don't dream. Winter sales is the one thing they're interested in. To them, dreams are the germs on their computer screens. Winter sales is the one thing they're interested in. Grey faces, empty lives. Then, an appearance! Here comes New Year's clearance. They fear what they're shown on the evening news. They desire what they see on daytime TV. - Can you help me out? - What do you need help with? I don't get this eyebrow thing... Lashes, I mean... Just kiddin'. Only fags have lashes. I need some face stuff for my mum... - Foundation? - Yes, that. What's her skin type? It's... motherlish. Older lady type, forty-ish... Oily or normal skin? Normal, I guess. Sponge or brush application? Aneta's trying to come off as a pro, but she can feel his look on her ass and her bra. It gives her goosebumps. A few beers is enough for her to suck him off. She wasn't like that before, but that look of his... just drops her on her knees. She doesn't know why... She's into it, he doesn't give a fuck. Always shows up stoned or drunk. Grey faces. A bus ride he can afford, but never buys the ticket. He just sits in the back, always a reject. No bonds for him. No nothing. Where's he actually going? To a terminus or just straight ahead? Shit! I forgot about the beat! He was supposed to meet up with a studio guy... Looks like his record isn't gonna fly. OTHER PEOPLE Monday. Behind the window a leaden sky. Christmas tree needles: dead illusions on the rug. Draft and elevator noise woke him up. His duvet drenched in sweat, his mouth so dry! The bad aftertaste is a sign: he got wasted last night. He had his reasons, but now it was almost ten! It was late. He quickly washed himself. Still looked like shit, but who'd care? He shaved and put on a jacket his mate left him. It was stolen and the wadding caked up. Good brand, bad karma: what a nasty reek! Like some fucking sheep... There was more: the smell of his sister's deo. Investigation's on! She wore it for smoking! You crossed the line. Payback time! Fucker! You spilled it all! - Notebook ruined, homework's gone. - Shit happens. - Like those dead needles... - The day's fucked already. He waited for that grey day for a long time. Shit right from the start... They'll flunk me you fucker! His ma utters words, sounding like she'd rather be dead. - Kamil? - She'd better just shut up instead. He was edgy and hung-over. They disconnected his mobile number. It's a shitty day. His plans fell through one after another. Like those dry needles falling on the carpet. Fucking day... Knocking around again? This ain't a hotel! You don't work, you don't study... The mobile phone bill's 1,5K. Do we have any food? Yes. - Other than the jam? - Well, no... No fucking way you release that record... Flatbread, mild sauce. Hey, dude! What up? Is your phone down? - New aftershave, darling? - Fucko... Show me what you got, let's not sit in this dump. What's this faggy thing? Gogu snatched it from his mother. What a shitty day. No service, no Internet, the huge bill to pay. The hangover... - Sell those pills and pay the bills. - Fucking deo scent! - Lousy fucking day... - And you're going the wrong way. The 6 goes to Bielany. Bad luck, but hey! It's a shitty day. He can't even call her, 'cause his phone is down. What a clown! - Do you have our app? - No. - Would you like to download it? - No. - May I interest you in our specials? - No, thank you. - Just the condoms? - Yes. That's 7,79. Contactless payment? Have a nice day. Shop with us again. I say that, because it's shop's policy, but I'm not really thanking you, you white-toothed twat. Do something about those goofy eyebrows. And you, de-age yourself. "Emergency! Come later." Send to: "Flush". Read it, you fuckwit. The number is currently unavailable. Why even pull off this stunt? Think with your brain, not with your cunt. He drove you to that. So why the shaky hands? You seem afraid. He met her a week before doing some shit-job chore. It was all worth fuck-all. The guy paid peanuts. Laughable. A gig for Ukrainians, not for Poles. Could I have some juice? - Is this love? - Sort of... She's kind of wooden and frigid. He's feeling a bit timid. Sick visions almost make him quiver: chicks so nude you see their livers! My husband's never home, and sometimes I need to fix something... Was that love? Fuck if I know. But he couldn't say "no". - Who's that? - The plumber. - Again? - Yes... the tub keeps leaking. Can you handle it? Here. I called about the tub. Is there a privy here? "Why put yourself in this mess?" - you ask yourself touching your dress. Your husband's shiny Volvo drives off... You try to undress, but you're cold. Get busy. Lose the socks. Is this love? It is, sort of. She's kind of cold and frigid. He's feeling a bit timid. Sick visions almost make him quiver: chicks so nude you see their livers. He sees tears cutting through her make-up... Time to cum and wrap up! He starts thinking of chicks so nude... you see their every fibre, star dust, explosions, electrons, atoms, their very DNA... Finished. Done for the day! Move it, get dressed. Give me a break. Kamil, go to bed! Get your ass off my sweater, stinky fucker! Cool place you have, but something's wrong here... My jacket reeks of cheap street food, but I like a good fuck too. Just tell me: What it is like when you dress your child? Your body smells lovely, but something here stinks. And it ain't my jacket! What would your husband say... seeing these hands doing your kid's homework? - Did you say something? - No... I've got to go. Parents' evening at school. Could you lend me... like 1,5K? C'mon. For her, it's nothing. Fucking phone bill for 1,5K... Would you like a wood tar soap? Or "The Pope's Miracles"? 12 zlotys, damn rip-off... Tough issues, gritty news of the day: the dick is king when it's after a prey. Painful matters, gritty news of the day: the dick is king when it's after a prey. Painful matters, gritty news of the day: the dick is king when it's after a prey. Painful matters, tough issues... No one believed he could still fly high on those wings once permanently clipped. Painful matters, tough issues... No one believed he could still fly high on those pernamently clipped wings... - "Permanently". - Fly high again... Fly high again. He thought the moon glowed so bright, but it was just the supermarket logo light. It's only five. Tower blocks were draped in garlands of lights. Sandra was doing homework watching "Painful Matters". - He switched his phone on... - Damn! Service is back. There's a dozen missed calls. And some texts from the morning: "Wanna hang out?" It's from Aneta who he fucked half-heartedly. - From Gogu: - "Bring the merch." - And then: - "Emergency! Come later." It's from that married babe. Sent in the morning... And so it all came back to him... - Get lost, you animal. - Buzz off. - I'll tell on you. - That's what you do. Showing off your boner... Painful matters, tough issues... Don't pick on me! Look at this mess! Fucking needles everywhere. And you just sit there? Don't talk to me with a hard-on! Painful matters, gritty news of the day... The dick is king when it's after a prey. This pick-up... can turn into a kickup. Nothing you can do about it. Painful matters, gritty news of the day... The dick is king when it's after a prey. You know this can turn into a kickup. Nothing you can do about this painful issue... Let's discuss the field trip. Good evening, Iwona. Stand up. Show it to everyone. So every parent here sees it. Make her pass it around. Today, Leon's mum... cuckolded her husband using this condom. Handle with care. No snatching, please! Easy, you'll have your turn. My turn now! She soiled... a womb that belongs to the Lord! Wife, mother to a child... engaged in intercourse with an apeman. Chose a non-literate over her own husband! You can't judge me. You're fat, with yellow teeth! She did it in her wedding bed linen... Probably naked. Under those clothes, she's probably still naked! You can have it off with me. For free! I've always liked you. I won't be judged by people with bad clothes and cheap furniture! Is everything all right? Please, sign the grade estimate. Just a second... Excuse me. Relax. No one's gonna know. I can't talk right now. Please, leave a message. She's got few pills left, but she doesn't care. She just wants them to take hold. She wants to surf towards the all-curing nothingness. Maybe all's not lost. Maybe our mortgage can be saved. Therapy! Or holiday! Australia, maybe... No, somewhere with no Poles! New Zealand, whatever! In her mind, she browses the Instagram of their happiness: Select all... They'll give to charity, help some poor kids. She'll be the darling of lifestyle magazines. Now, she acts instinctively: go to a mall, buy it all! Winter sales, she's on a roll! New arrivals are here too! The new me needs new trousers and a fondue pot! Slight overdraft... But her dream wasn't daft. It can all turn out well! It's going to be fine. Cheer up! We too had a bad mortgage and used to fight a lot. Dad did coke almost every night... I had no tears left to cry. He was a sex addict then, but now all is well. Believe me, babe, all can turn out well. I too cheated on my husband with a thug. Everyone does that. That's life. You'll be fine. - When will you be home? - In 15 minutes. Junior's hungry. Everything OK? You called. Is something wrong with the car? Wouldn't start. Mum, what's for dinner? - And the tub? - The tub? - Oh, it's fixed... - What's for dinner? Turn it down! Did you take the drawer money? I had to pay... for a spare part. - 1,5K for a part? - That included labour. - Ukrainians charged that much? - No... normal Polish guys. That seal must be made of gold. - You're going out? - Yes. Make him something. He's hungry and he got an F. - Where are you going? - Got to meet up with Lena. Yeah, right... You think I'm blind? Or I don't use Facebook? "Klaudia Bochoń likes that." Every single post! Even if it's a dwarf fucking a horse! Are you meeting tonight? Swear to God you're not. No! Swear on our Leon! Iwona, I implore you! Be reasonable! I want you to swear! That's it. - I bought some wine. - What for? - I wanted to talk. - I'm hungry! - About what? - Mum! - What do you want to eat? - Pasta, with no sauce on it! Please, turn it down! - I'll be back late. - Remember, no sauce! No sauce! Just pasta, no sauce... Boiled pasta, that's it! Yes, card's OK. Get that fucking tree out! You've been smoking that shit... I can tell by your eyes. I should spank your ass! Mum, just don't talk. - Going somewhere? - I'm meeting a girl. A girl? New jacket? Bought with what? It's too flimsy! Cover your kidneys, put on a scarf! Enough! Look... "John Paul II's Miracles" A proper gift this time. - And your job search? - Fuck all! I told you it's bad! - Why? - I've had enough. No fucking way you get that record out! Jesus Christ, now king of Poland, said the Angelus with his followers. Cars, cars everywhere. Where's everyone going? This time? This season? He's driving too... But at least for a reason! They could all walk or just take a tram... But they're too self-important to mingle with scum! Everyone takes their pride and joy some shitty old Toyota or other toy... And off they go! Bang, honk, purr... To work, to school. New gentry coming through. Frozen pheasant hunters with a true zest. Everyone's best fucking the rest. Where the fuck is she? Coming! Why so serious? She'd love to prove he's a shit father. He wants to prove her wrong. Despite loads of work and hating it all... He's there right on time when she calls. A jealous thought crosses his mind. You see, there was a time... when he too aimed to be techy, fit, and cool. Spent quite a lot on some proper shoes. Staying in shape is 30% workout and 70% diet. - By the way... - What's greengage? He felt like a kid who fancied an ice cream swirl... and got some shit straight from hell. The box diet thing seemed OK... but actually it tastes like dirt. Hey, you there! Take it. Just be careful. It's very healthy, could be lethal. Thanks, guv! They can't afford bread, so let them have it... Could you buy me something to eat? Preferably sugar and gluten free. Thanks! - Hi there! - Hi. OK, so? - What's the plan? - Plan? That weird Montana accent... Hannah Montana-like. I don't have any. How about bowling? - Just a joke. - Get real. She's not pretty. She won't have it easy. She should gain weight. Looks like a rake in drag. How about some food? Let's eat out. - In a restaurant? - Let's have pasta. That face: as if I suggested we have a threesome with her mother... Come on! It'll be fun. Is this a joke? Food? - New wheels? - Yes. I mean... I'm just test driving it. It's cool and has massaging seats... but we can't afford one of these. Iwona and I are broke. The mortgage's killing us. - It's a stalemate. - But she had enough to have her tits done. - Pardon? - That's what mum says. - That's rubbish! - Really? She showed me Iwona's photos on Facebook. She used to have spots, and now... it's her boobs everywhere! - Pathetic! - It's none of mum's business. She'd better take care of her own... problems. Some sex would do her good. Somehow, when I need money for my eating disorder treatment... you're always broke. Mum says it's usually due to the relationship with the father... so you should pay for it. I told you, let's eat out. I'll buy you a steak! Embarrassment central! From a guy's perspective, let me tell you... that's not sexy at all. - What? - Looking like from concentration camp. A normal guy wouldn't lay a finger on you... So? What's sexy then? Iwona, with her silicone udders? - She has a nice figure. - Give me a break, dad! - She's fat. - She's not! She's not? So why do you cheat on her? Don't repeat everything you're told by that cunt... by mum, I mean. Hi, mummy. No, I'm not crying. We're in the car. All is great. Yeah, except your acting. Mum wants you to drive me back now. Visit us some day. Selfie? The last bit wasn't very good... but some parts went pretty smooth. Therapy? Get a slice of bread and eat! That's it. I'll cure her for free. He records everything. Her words, her sulking... Those are the effects of modern parenting! Children despise men. They're raised by fucked up women... Their only merit is that they're a single mother. The supermarket logo shines again. He can't help remembering the married babe. Even on his way to Aneta's. That pussy... Aneta knows how to handle a dick... Aneta knows how to handle a dick, but that's another league! This one's Lewandowski, the top scorer. Aneta is a kid, a wannabe footballer... asking stars for autographs, dreaming of playing for thousands of fans... But damn she's fit! And so... Aneta-ish. He kept forgetting her major. Gastronomy? Or was it nutrition? At some crap school with low tuition... He wasn't that interested. She was from Radzyń, worked part-time at a mall. They met there, after all. Awkward, man! In Wrzeciono, with a flatmate she rented two rooms... That's in the woods! Going there really made him sick. On the way, he'd buy her some sweet shit. Breezers, faggy crap! What the fuck is "Chateau Rosso"? Must be some faggy business... Stinky faggots. And greedy ones at that. 23 zlotys for that pink crap... Fuck me! Supermarket again... Buy her coke and other sweet stuff. Breezers, faggy crap! Is Aneta around? She's in the shitter. He's not against lesbians, you know. But if a dyke slams a door on him... OK, I know the vibe... everybody fucks who they like. Gay parades, modern times. But you know what? Two babes in bed look cool, but none of them has the tool. Nothing you can do! Everyone knows that! Even priests fuck priests... Is there any limit to it? And now you lot? There's a draft... What went wrong for you? With guys, I mean. I'm not fixing you myself, but... Kamil? - What's that smell? - What? - I can smell some slag's perfume! - What the fuck, Aneta? Don't bullshit me! It's Adidas Spring! Let's not get bogged down! Watch out, damn it! Take it easy! C'mon... Let's get busy! Don't tell me to slow down, don't look into my eyes... Don't ask what I see... It's stuff not dreamt of in your philosophy! - Hey, what's going on? - Trust me, you don't wanna know. Yeah, it's your body I'm fondlin'... but you're no lead, you're a stand-in. To Justa, Kamil was just a piece of shit. Well... he wasn't always there for me. It wasn't much better at home... Does he have a steady job? When will you marry and have children? It's time to move in together. We could help his career. What do I tell her? Not tomorrow, I guess. Occupation: slacker and proud. Money: less and less. His idea of shopping is grab and run... That's his kind of fun. And what do I tell them about his plan? - A record? Is the police after him? - "Beet" like beetroot? He said he'd come for New Year's. Another drunken blooper... I thought of dumping him. He really made me feel like shit. Tell your fiancé not to urinate on the patio. It was just once, all right? Justa took a long time... Crapping! I won't move back to Radzyń anyway. - Why's that? - It's completely dead. - You wouldn't have to rent a flat! - He's using you. Yes! Keep it like that! Hesiod was born in Beotia, most likely... Don't stop! In the year 800 B.C. Harder! Believed to have been an aoidos and an astronomer... second only to Homer! Get that leg off of me... It tickles... You know what? It is your mum's? Hey! What's wrong with you! What's in it? Look me in the eye. - Gotta go. - What? Don't even ask... Gotta clean the rug. Fucking needles everywhere. It's funny how we got the tree... There was a TV event, you could get one for free! Me and my sis went to the gig and grabbed one each. A third one was almost ours... but some fucker kicked up a fuss. Hey, smarty-pants! What the fuck? You're a tree therapist? - And you? An eco-mentalist? - Fuck off or I'll smack you! O yeah, tough guy? He was a big man... so we took two and scrammed. Then, a quick subway ride. C'mon! Why not take it if it's free? We're in Poland! It's genetic! - Mum didn't get it... - Two? Are you nuts? I'll sell one and make a few bucks. Let's say 30 zlotys. - That's a third of the regular price... - She's right. I'm not that tight. Let Sandra ask around in school... I'm not peddling it! - You better do! - Fuck you! - I'll sell it myself and keep the cash. - What about me? Right, I'll give it to mum. At least that was the plan... But then I put it in the bathroom and it dried up. Mum threw it away. What a fucking waste. Well... I didn't think it through. Nice trousers. Are they new? I'm really sorry. I have a job to do. - What job? - For real... Don't cry. Look... Chateau Rosso dropped by. C'mon, drink some. I really gotta go. I'll leave you with my bro. He'll keep you company. You can chat about guys and the shitty life... I worked at a mall too, I know the vibe. You can take some dirty selfies... Dirty selfies? Anonymous user: I'd fuck her in a heartbeat. Dirty fucker. Don't try to watch me walk off. I'll just disappear in the fog. You treat me like some self-service deal... You pretend you're browsing, but always try to steal. - Can I help you? - No... just browsin'. Then, you steal stuff from the shelves. The hood is your hiding. And I know it's me you're stealing. You run off and leave me like a torn packaging. Alone. Alone, alone, alone... - Are you alone? - Why? - How are the examinations going? - I'm preparing for my... Eating lactose?! Girl, it acidifies you! I'm fat. Don't get obsessed, you're not. Thanks. I am. Not really. If you lost some weight... you'd be slim. Where do you think you're going? Don't close it, please. I'm claustrophobic and... So stay in tight spaces, practice and get over it! - Here, have some. - No, thanks... What? Are you some rag-head? - I just don't want it... - I'm not having this. C'mon, drink up! By the way, tell me... Are you...? I mean... Do you have a boyfriend? - Yes. - So where is he? In Kutno. What's his name? Grzesiek. Show me his photo or something. - He's not on Facebook. - Why? He just doesn't want to. - Is he tall? - Fairly. - Blonde? Dark-haired? - Sort of half-way... - Is he good? - Yes. I don't mean does he care about animals. Is he good at... you know? I don't... Is he good at eating pussy? You're blushing, so he must be pretty good. - Are you nervous? - No. - So why are you trembling? - I don't know. Come one, what's wrong? - Easy, we're just chatting. - Sure. Fuck me... I can't fucking stand it. What planet is she from? Do I teach her the basics of human behaviour? Oh no, no, no! Makeover's on! Proper TV style! I gotta tell you... I was pretty sure you were gay. For the record, I think it's OK. I French-kissed my own sister when I was wasted. But that's not the point, let's face it. Dykes are mostly chicks that no guy likes... So they flip sides and tell themselves lies: "I'm a lesbian!" "I'm a lesbian!" They'd fuck guys if they could. No one's ever fucked them good! They'd fuck guys if they could. No one's ever fucked them good! Has no one ever told you not to wear your hair like this? This hairdo isn't for you. You look like... the ogre girl from Shrek. Fiona! Fuck yeah! I mean, what is this? People can't appreciate frankness. - Open the door! - No! We're going to cure you. Why can bad people be bad and the rest of us have to be good? I too would love to assault someone. I'd love to rape. But I'm not allowed to! - I dream of violence too. - I'll help the two of you. Jesus... Why can bad people just be bad? Mateusz! Long time no see. What's up? - Quiet life... - Decent jacket. I have kids and ain't broke. I work for Coke. Seems pleased. Free fizzy drinks. Fanta, Sprite... - You think they're good? - Actually, I prefer brew. - And what do you do? - Why? Gigs in construction? - Fuck no! I'm releasing a record. - What record? Not a fucking chronicle. What do you think? Hurt ya? Didn't it? He thought I was a grunt doing crappers, so people fill them with tampons and floaters. No, I chose my own path! A misunderstood artist from the hood, doing rap, like I knew I would! Shit-eat-sleep... That's not how I live! I'm not a robot set to breed! Try explaining it to that brainless bugger. His idea of bliss are two cans of lager! The highlight of his day! Is it ready? I start recording soon. I'm finishing the lyrics... This is me. My car's over there. - See that Volvo? - It's yours? Left it here before a gig. - What, you don't believe? - I do... - You think it's bullshit. - Forget it. So quickly? Do I look like I have Alzheimer's? Take care. Say hi to your wife. And do her good tonight. Then, you can have your Coke! Over there, music, gluten and beer on tap... He's trying to warm up. Next to the air vent flap. Bums ate his brown trout. Now he's about to pass out. That's what he's like. He'd share the smallest slice. Even Jesus wasn't that nice. Even the saintliest saint wouldn't just stand there and faint. I used to be like that too. I fed the multitude, gave people wine and stuff... People grabbed as much as they could carry. All of it ended up on eBay. Less for you, more for me. Take it if it's free. It's our genetics. - Gogu sent you? - Yes. - Where is he? - On holiday. You're his stand-in? I'm sorry. I haven't eaten all day. - It's focaccia. - Enjoy. - My first bite today... - No problem. - Would you like a slice? - Thanks, I've already eaten. So take it home. I normally don't eat crap like that. And this... Lava cake. No, thanks. Reducing body fat? Going low on carbs? New workout plan? Man, get real. - FBW with dumbbells? - I don't work out. What? "Fire" it was called... He once dropped by to Danny's small gym. You know, a whim. A guy who owed Danny money left him this weird shit. You know, a deposit. They looked it over... It's only 2 PM. It's Friday. 2 PM on a Friday means weekend. Friday is basically Saturday... Start on Friday, finish on the next one. Let's not fuck around! Danny closed the gym. They popped it... and waited. Feel anything yet? I don't. Bolek... This stuff ain't fire, it's ass fart. You owed me 2K, now you owe me 3! Why get tense? Fuck the cash, enjoy the stash. He felt bliss and ease. LEGO blocks and summer breeze... Mate, chill out, please. It heated up all out of sudden. The boys looked at one another. Next thing he knew, he felt a beat... there was fire, joy, tropical heat! Love, music, all so sweet! Joy, bliss, unlike anything before... He felt like rolling naked all over the floor. Danny was now his brother, father and his best friend. Funny, he didn't know him all that well... Who started the groping? He couldn't tell. He thought it was Danny in his trance. Danny says Kamil started that faggy dance. Fuck no! From behind, he could feel his hard-on. Then, he looked at the stash again... On the side it said: "Love Flame". Love flame... L-o-v-e f-l-a-m-e! - What? - I just don't work out, OK? Pick up and say where the fuck you are! Klaudia Bochoń... Nike Air Max? At your age? Need some tips? That pattern doesn't go with your hips. Tits like dead fish... You're not getting any younger! Her legs still look OK... Above the waist, she's an insult to taste. A 40-year-old living at work, with a closet full of Nikes. Wears them to weddings, funerals and parties. Check this: #happy #lazyweekend. Right... In real life, she cries alone at night waiting for Maciek to come. Wears Nikes to funerals and wedding parties, always someone else's. She even has a special pair for getting her kicks from Netflix... and another one for pee-walking her dog, a Jack Russel terrier. On Instagram it's #happiness, #lazyweekend. Right... In real life, she cries alone at night... begging Maciek to come! Again... begging me to come. This is getting harder and harder. The hiding, sending texts from the shitter... More and more, it looks like Iwona knows. As Klaudia keeps calling him... "My love", he's trying to figure out an exit plan. Yet, he feels sorry for her. She's all alone in town. What if she... never mind! May have uttered "I love you" once now the girl thinks she has a chance. She clang to it despite everything. He pulled, pushed and bit. How the hell does he leave? Women are dumb, cause Blacks are black... Fags are fags! - You don't chill red wine... - It will be fine. - Where's the corkscrew? - In the drawer, maybe? Oh God... Know what? Sometimes, I'm afraid of dying... - and leaving no mark. - No mark? An unpaid mortgage and some stuff on Facebook. Nice fabric. - Thanks. - New trousers? I get cancer... or some snow falls on my head. And that's it, I'm dead! End it, man. She really likes him and it's all good... but it's not enough to share a kitchen hood. He thought it was a Christmas loan, a tiny moral debt... It turns out he's fucked with Mr Big Head. At first, he thought he could dump her in a humane way... slowly, day by day. And now, Iwona... - Where are you? With her again? - Come on... Where are you? He was now on his way to tell her it's the end. Calmly but firmly. Brutally but gently. Full lock right. Shift into reverse. Press the accelerator. Now brake. Steering wheel straight. Shift into "D". - You have reached your destination. - I like that park assist thing. I could use a life assistant. It would assist me at work and at home... It would brake or bong anytime I did something wrong. All will be fine, just tell her. OK. Sorry for doing it by text: our thing is over. - Switch the phone off. She'll likely call. - Right. You can talk tomorrow, when she's calm. At least he doesn't love her. He loves nobody, not even our Leon. She dreamed of nothing. Desired nothing. Till dawn, she'd sink in mounds of nothingness surrounded by gorillas dancing gracefully. Long ago, not knowing why, they gave up on sex. In her dirty SUV, she'd drive their kid ever faster... to swimming classes, to German classes... She'd put on stronger and stronger make-up. Steady dose increase. Every day she wanted to slam the door and leave. And yet, she never did. For what mortgage has joined, let no one put asunder. What mortgage has joined, let no one put asunder. Up there, there's space. Different worlds, possibly another race. Hope it's not just a big lie, 'cause our world isn't fly. What's going to happen to it? Well, our prospects look shit. Disasters and crimes. Don't hope for the best. Every season of this show could be the last. Why do bad people have to be bad and not good? Sometimes, I feel like doing something, but I get it all wrong. Well-known family affair, Sandra's second birthday... Auntie came from Deutschland with a gift for her godchild. Hello, dear! This is for you. It was LEGO Technic. Aunt didn't care, just liked the reduced price... Sandra started crying, but he thought it was very nice! He badly wanted that LEGO space rover. Would've had a hard-on, if he'd been older. He devoured it with his eyes. As they focused on the booze, he hid in his room. Hush! He opened the box and the bags inside... started reading the instructions. It was true magic, hours just flew by. The adults were having a real good time... "Que sera, sera", some Polish classics... Well, it was a mess, but he couldn't care less. He just kept building and building. Axles, bumpers, dampers... The finale, however, was tragic. He wanted to share the magic, let mummy know one day he'd be an constructor or an astronaut... Kamil, oh my God... Mum! Go to bed! Next morning, the rover was undone. She must've been up all night... She hoped she'd just sell it on... but wasn't able to peddle it. Looks unboxed. Wouldn't give it to him either, robbed him of his wings to a single feather. Iwona? Is there any sauce? Still up? Don't give me that look. Tomorrow I'm back on the box diet. Were you at work? No, with Lena. I told you. Check out our selfies. Cool! Is Leon still up? He's not, it's 3 AM. Aren't you going to bed? Somehow, I'm not sleepy. I'll do some work. I wanted to talk, tell you something... Tell me what? Just... things. I wanted to talk, but you were in a hurry... Talk now. Leon was hungry and there was no time... I tried, but I didn't have the courage to tell you... Tell me now. I wanted to tell you, but there wasn't enough time. Don't cry. - I'm not. - I can tell. Choke it out. I... I can't. I'm afraid you won't forgive me. I will. - Don't get so worked up. - I'm not. Your hands are shaking. I'm not worked up. I was... I was reversing in the parking lot... I hit a pole, bent something and dented the bumper. It was Tuesday morning already, but he kept napping, mistook the radiator noise for the trees rustling, or some waves splashing. Shit! That's a surprise! Freud would've laughed. Last time that happened he was a lad. He scored pretty early with the greengrocer lady. He remembered her scent all too well: dirt, gherkins, carrots, all foul as hell. More fume than perfume. She was no hot bit, but she sold smokes by piece. Cool of her. Kamil! I found these by the door. Countless times she'd call the cops. Under any pretence possible! Always ratting on him: For walking down the street. For hanging out by the bins. 'Cause birds shit here! For breathing air. For just being there! Police! Your ID, darling. We've had calls. They're not your mother's, are they? Give them to me! Mum... Mum! Looking into your bright face... I remember my childhood days. Once you lulled me to sleep, now you're sleeping deep. Your face, so fair even with wrinkles here and there... What have you done to the Christmas tree? I just... took the baubles off. Why do bad people have to be bad... and not good? Fuck! Sometimes I feel like doing something, but... Of course you did. They were expensive... Holy Mary, Lord Jesus... Saint Peter and The Holy Trinity... They were so pretty! I didn't meant it. Karma was shitty! I'll kill your ass! You'll pay for them! - And so, I'm fucked again. - Lord Jesus, Holy Mary. He broke the star of the Three Wise Men... I want it cleaned before I'm back! - Let Sandra do it! - I've got a test. No wonder he doesn't play for keeps with a mother like this. They all like action, fun and booze. He does too! But no family life, please! No sofas and washing machines! He'd prefer a vodka shot, but now... he's 3 zlotys short. Damn, 3,11... Hey, love, got some spare change? Thanks! You're hot, but I've got to go! It was cool and all, but now I'm off! You know me, I'm no prince. Marriage ain't for me. I like our bed vibe, but I'm not a hubby type! - I'm an adventure bum. - Living with your mom... Every time I just go my way the lass tries to make me stay. - If she sees you don't give a fuck... - She'll fight to turn it around. Get that? Fucking twists. Hi there, dork. Ignoring my calls? He doesn't get it, but that's what they always do. Aneta was no exception to the rule. At first, played it cold and cool. Fucking snow queen act. The act soon came to its end. She became the queen of giving head. But first, some tease. His dick was never at ease. "Christmas? New Year's? What are your plans?" He just boozed up with some friends. From Radzyń, she fired texts at him like the Terminator squashing the police! Still waiting! Kamil! Ten missed calls... Turn it off! 5, 4, 3, 2, 1! He drunk hard with the boys from his hood... The crew partied hard! WTF?!! He didn't know where he was anymore... Drowned in bliss, oblivion and alcohol... Booze and weed were his brain's lube. He revelled in games and tunes from YouTube. Drop the beat! Tobi's here... Bolek's here. Gienek. - And Danny! - Fuck off. Drunk chick on the floor equals easy score... #metoo fails hard when you're caught off guard! Don't blubber, 'cause if you take chances, you pay the consequences. Shut up and don't sulk. It's a lesson in life. Drunk chick on the floor equals easy score! #metoo is bullshit, nothing more! Who takes chances pays the consequences! Call your Uber, get dressed, get lost! Don't blubber, accept the cost! Alcohol's bad, that's nothing new... My alcoholic father I barely knew. I won't end up like that, wanna take a bet? My sis is beginning her alco-adventure. At times I drink too, but there's no danger. I like to drink, dance and have fun, but I never lose control... Blah... blah blah. Yadda fucking yadda! "Come at 5." I will, darling. Mum! There's someone at the door. I'm coming... Good morning, you forgot I was coming... - Who's that? - The Ukrainian cleaning lady. - Did you pick up my diet box? - No. Of course... You crash my cars, but that was too much to ask? It fucking hurts. It just slipped my mind. Isn't Leon going to school? He's not. - Why? - Can't you drive him for once? Sweet suggestion, but I'm late already. - Hello? - Wednesday is available. Wednesday? I just need one prescription. - The doctor is on holiday. - What holiday?! What do I do now? Not this stinky rag, please! Would you like something? Cappuccino? Mocha? Latte? You take milk? Xylitol? Sugar? Agave syrup? The mister seems irritated... He's on a diet. You know, hungry-angry. You know that saying in Polish? Sedentary lifestyle, driving everywhere... and he got fat like a... Bye! I'll be back late. But you know, individual presence is a question of aesthetics... I make him dress in a way that conceals bulk. There's also the health issue. For a man, obesity should be impossible to bear... A fat man starts to look like some old mare. My husband saw a dietician, bought a pair of running shoes... but just yesterday he reeked of junk-food. It's only natural: passion faints. It grows weaker with every passing day. And yet it hurts so much that he doesn't touch me at all. Not to mention sex, that's long gone. Sometimes I feel a desperate need for touch. I see couples fondling on every billboard, every square. All around me, men love their girls despite their fat thighs and bad hair. Their cheap clothes and poor make-up choice... Looking at them I always ask myself: are all of them doing a laundry day? And yet, their husbands fancy them. Once in a while, they have sex. They don't do drugs and snore like hogs. He knows I just hate it! When he's on coke, I can't stand him! The loud voice, the work-up, the long rants... usually on things boring as fuck. Still, it's a choice I make. We have a mortgage to pay. I also do it for our child... We want him to have a loving family around. Nothing is more important for a child than family. And you? When do you go back to Ukraine? - Next month. - Oh, that's soon enough. Just a jiffy. I guess you're missing your family? You're missing your people, your home... Your son. Well, it's only natural. But you can see for yourself: in Poland, we're better off, and yet it's not all happiness and love. It's not a question of money or no money... Oh, good! I was going to ask you to do that. Look, the mister forgot his phone. He'll be livid when he realises that. Let's see... Leon feeding skittles to elephants. My love... can you talk now? Is that you, Maciek? "Come at 5." Send to: "Flush". I will, darling. Was it love? Almost, not quite. She was blazing, alight. He was horny too, like in hard-core porn, He could feel her scorn and that turned him on! He was actually surprised to see her text... He thought it was a one-off and he'd never pay her back. But despite the loan he ached for another go. If they'd given him a fast forward button... he'd have gone straight to her flat, but he had urgent stuff to do before that. Watch out for the crone! Kamil! I found this. Is it yours? - Nah. - Whose is it then? Get this thing off of me! It's going to rip my jeans! Is she some fucking alien spy? Sorry I'm late. No problem. Take off your shoes. My socks are wet. Cum on my face. It took him a while, his imagination flew high. Women so nude you see their inside. "Excuse me, my ovary slid out. Could you reach for it?" She seemed wild, angry, almost scary. Guys are always into porn, women not necessarily... They want hugs, a kiss here and there… This one wanted him to pull her hair! It did look cool on a computer screen, but in real life he's not into it. On her laptop, he saw a divorce chat room page. Then, he saw tears on her face. Suddenly, he felt uneasy. Her situation looked rather sleazy. Looked like she had a problem. A real one! She and her husband... Do they even fuck? Eventually, he lost the vibe. It's a massive turn-off, that doesn't feel right. She sped up like never before, but it was of no use anymore... I can't, I'm sorry. Don't worry. I may be coming down with something. It is yours? - LEGO Technic, ain't it? - Could be. Used to play with it. I had a space rover... - Really? - Auntie brought it from Germany for my sis. - That's interesting. - I mean, she's my half-sister, really. Mum slipped-up with some geezer. Holy Mary told her to keep her... So... she got the LEGO and I pieced it together. I thought mum and my stepdad would kill my ass. Not a real stepdad, I mean... just mum's fuck buddy. My real dad had a bloody death. Smashed a glass door and cut open the aor... - Aorta. - Yes, that. I grew up without a father, that was a harmer. No male role model... no computer either. - All the kids in my class had computers... - Don't bug me. Why would you need one? "It's a whim", she said. "Not worth a dime." - The Internet, she also couldn't brook... - Rubbish, read a book! - By the way... - What? You have many books. We do... - Have you read them? - Some... Love stories, I bet. I have lyrics about that too, but I'm more into social problems. You know, real-life stuff. With love, it's complicated. It comes and goes, hard to put a finger on it... Especially if you've never really felt it. I still need to figure out what my first album will be about. My record, you know... My record. C'mon, ask me about it! But she wouldn't. I have to leave... Leave? Wearing a bathrobe? - Don't bug her, there's no use... - Gotta go. Can I have some juice? I have to go now. OK, how much? Aneta! Mud creaked under his feet. He heard his own heavy breathing. The soundtrack of my album! He wondered where to go. Just didn't feel like going home. No purpose, no destination... 4,40 full fare? No way! Aneta's mall was just a few stops away. He'll have to find a way to apologize. The way he vanished, wasn't very nice. Didn't listen, didn't even stay for a while. Maybe she's right. It was kind of juvenile. But now he's ready to explain it all. Aneta is his only goal! Screw the rich hag! No news from her, not a single character... Strange. Normally, she'd send like 15 texts. And now, no complaints, no firing back... Just silence. Profile picture unchanged... - "What up?" - Message sent, no reply. "Sorry about yesterday, let's hang out tonight." He kept trying to make it right, but no answer would ever come. The tram howled like a wounded beast. He felt hurt too, lost in the mist. What if he'd taken the MILF's money? He'd easily have enough to buy some tasty Nikes. Walking down the aisle, he looked at sneakers, shiny, new, with turn signals, satnav, and beepers. He'd just settle for a pair with no water in them. Aneta! Is Aneta around? No, she took time off. What's that? And who are you? Her agent or gay friend? Watch it! - Another tram ride... - Another fucking ticket. Fuck! Good evening, ticket inspection! He's almost had it now. This is just too much. Too many payment notices from emotions and life. Someone's gonna pay big time! - Is Aneta home? - No. She murdered her and hid the body in her closet. Now, she's in front of the mirror... trying on parts of Aneta's body. Fucking fresh lioness! Sipping Chateau fucking Rosso and taking selfies. Aneta! Aneta, baby! Aneta! You treat me like some self-service deal. You pretend you're browsing, but you're here to steal. - Can I help you? - No... just browsin'. Then, you steal stuff from the shelves. The hood is your hiding. And I know it's me you're stealing. You run off and leave me like a torn packaging. Alone. Alone. Alone. Alone. You... How dare you! That bloody washbag! I told you it would end like this! The police have just been here! - You what? - I said "police". I had a washbag here... "Oriflame" branded? Mum flushed it down the shitter. What? The police were coming. What was she supposed to do? Did you really flush it? I've had enough of this. Let them lock you up. I don't care anymore! I'll get a job soon. Just need to finish my record. What planet do you live on? What record? - Sandra told me everything. - Told you what? It's all horseshit. To record anything you'd need those... tunes. - It's called "beat". - Fuck! The beats! Whatever... You don't have any! I told them you no longer lived here. But that snitching hag told them otherwise. Today, on this sofa, face in your hands... you know this is where it ends. Heaps of dirty laundry are your sorry realm. "John Paul II's Miracles" still unpacked, tossed on the floor like any old crap. No miracles for us! They're down the crapper! They'll forever stay under the wrapper. Farewell, mother. Before he knew it, the elevator rode down. He was now on the street, out. Walked through the projects like through purgatory. On the colourless sky, the sun seemed a grey apple. Walked by a billboard and by Aneta's work... then saw a jogger in an anti-smog mask. The guy could really spook with his Hannibal Lecter look. His heart pounded like some crazy busker drummer. An ambulance... Not for him? What a bummer. Snow hit some lass on the head. She's on the stretcher, looking dead. He noticed her Nikes... They're better than mine, but girl, you're going nowhere. Not like this No. 9 tram that's speeding to the airport. A tram ride he can afford, but doesn't want the ticket. He just sits in the back, always a reject. No bonds for him. No nothing. Where's he actually going? To a terminus? Shit! The beat! He was supposed to meet up with a studio guy... Looks like his record isn't gonna fly. Yo, hippie. Lose that stinky vibe. No fucking way your record's gonna fly. Aneta! Grey faces. People here don't dream. Winter sales is the one thing they're interested in. To them, dreams... are the germs on their computer screens. Winter sales is the one thing they're interested in. Grey faces. Uneventful lives. Then, a winter appearance: early sales and post-Christmas clearance. Those are theirs fears, those are their dreams. Grey faces.
