Father! Surya Uncle! Who is that person? I have kept my mobile in his packet. Call my number. He must be the supporter of the man whom you thrashed. No! Bro! I will not sell my land. Do not torture me. Leave me. Leave. Give. Give the document. Hey! Document is written by you. I will read it. Hear. I, Rangappa am unable to repay the loan taken from Cable Babu. Subu! What is meant by 'I am unable'? It means 'do not have the ability'. Super. Correct. Thank you very much. Give the cover. PP! Blue print is in the car. Go and bring it. - Okay Boss. Babu! I know you since many years. But I am unable to understand one thing. What? - Why have you kept this lame man as your right hand? I made him lame. He was once my enemy. He tried to act smart with me. So I removed one of his legs. Is this the one? - Yes. We should not keep a dangerous person away from us. Should keep him nearby. That's all. What do you say? Forget it. Why are you talking about the past? What is this? Airport is coming up near Laxmipuram. Airport? - Yes. If we purchase land there now, we will get a good rate in future. Superb. You know these things well. But my brother is the right person for matters such as buying land. One minute... Boss! Your brother is calling. Where are you? - In Hubli. Come immediately. You have some work here. I will come after a week. Okay. You should have informed the matter to Babu. Should I have told that I was thrashed? I will not spare that boy. Did you enquire about him? - Yes. His name is Surya. 'He is a local guy. Prepares Biryani in a road side stall.' 'He has the reputation of being short-tempered,' 'local dancer and it seems he has lots of fans.' 'People throng to see his dance.' 'If you touch him, he is like high voltage power.' That one man beat us badly. Can't bear the pain. In the meantime there was a problem. We ignited the shops. But a person named Doddamane Rajeeva... Who is that Rajeeva? Don't you know him? That is why I am asking you. Who? Don't you know Doddamane Rajeeva? I have been asking repeatedly. But you are saying the same thing. Is he a Minister or Filmstar? He is above them. Hail Rajeeva Uncle! Hail Rajeeva Uncle! Hail Rajeeva Uncle! These places have been donated by Doddamane. Doddamane Rajeeva is called 'Karna' of Kaliyug. Kaliyuga Karna! This is just a Political gimmick. I know. It is not Politics. He is not in Politics. He proposes the names of the Candidate. Everyone must take his support and stand for election. If they do not do work after winning, he will drive them away from the place with the help of local people. PP! I want to see Rajeeva. No. I think we are going towards a dangerous thing. Danger is going in search of him. Do you understand? I will show my power to Rajeeva today. Hail Rajeeva Sir! Hail Doddamane Rajeeva Sir! Hail Rajeeva Sir! Greetings to all of you. I have come to give some good information to our villagers. I have decided to donate 20 acres of land in Hanumanthgudi to build a hospital. Do not think that I am publicizing my donation. We have to think many times before doing a wrong deed. But if we want to do a good deed, we should do it instantly. People will remember that even after the person's death. Now Doddamane Krishna will speak. Do not call him 'Rajeeva' even by mistake. People here will kill us. I do not have the courage to speak in front of Rajeeva Sir. But I would like to say this. Rajeeva Sir is our role model. Let us tread on his path. Hail! Hail! Hail! Hail! - Is he a great leader? All are falling at his feet. Hail! Hail! Rama! Stop near a good hotel for food. Okay. Let us go to Hotel Hanumantha. - Boss! What are you doing? This is the Samadhi of Doddamane. People consider this as temple and worship this place. Is this a temple? - Yes. Is this place, where ghosts live, a temple for you? I will show you now. I will show. Hey! - Yes Boss. Bring whiskey. - Coming. PP! I will sit in this temple and drink. I will see what they will do to me. They will break your hands. Let me see that. Take. - Give. We need entertainment. We should enjoy. PP! Come and dance. Dance. Boss! I will bring Rajeeva. - Go. I will thrash him and bring him here. - Go. Hey Rajeeva! Our Boss Babu is calling you. Come. What happened? Who beat you? I told him that you are calling him and asked him to come. He put his hand on my shoulders and came with affection. But afterwards he thrashed everyone. What are you doing here? Don't you have sense? Swami! When will God come? Doddamane Rajeeva. Are you God? It seems you warned my boy that we will not get even an inch of land here. How dare you? I will take everything including yours. Will you see? Do you know who I am? Babu. Cable Babu. My foot! I don't care who you are. I have not given my visiting card to anyone to identify myself. You must have heard about me. But not seen me. If you show arrogance even after seeing me you will lose every part of yours one by one. You are a filthy person who does not respect elders. Not just your feet... Even your breath should not touch our place. No, Boss. I know something bad has happened by seeing your fractured hand. I will kill him. This happened to you! I feel the same like you Give. Keep it. This sandal garland was brought for God. But it is put for my husband's photo. Who put it? Someone has put it by mistake. How many times will you say this? Remove it. Okay. I will remove. Rajeeva! Daily all of them say that your brother-in-law is dead and they pray. Can anything happen to him when you are there? Calm down. Doctor! - Yes. I feel bad. Do not worry. She has improved. Your decision to not admit her in hospital is correct. Can we give her treatment in some other country? Not at all required. The most important thing she needs is your love. And she is getting it. She will be cured very soon. Tooth is very important to humans. A grown up human has 32 teeth. These are called Molars. This... All of you look here. Stop it. Look here. Okay. Open your mouth. Your molars are broken. Check if anything else is weak. Okay Sir. Okay. - Wait. We have tooth. Give. - What? I gave you the tooth. I will give you. What? What are you searching? - I am searching. Wait. I will kill you if my tooth is not there. Sir! It is not possible to fix the original tooth that you have. We can fix artificial tooth. You can make it in Gold, Platinum or any other metal. What? How many years does tooth remain in humans? The molar tooth remains for 65-70 years. For some it is there till their death. He hit me in public. The people who worship him as God should beat him with slippers. They should hit him. He should die. He has done such a thing to me that I will remember it till my death. What is this? - Tooth. Got it now. Keep it in the bag. One minute... Tooth cannot be used again. It is gone. Guess why I am so happy. What happened to my dear child? I am doing the main role in the act. - Good. Do you know how fast I say the dialogues? You should see my show. You should not miss it. I will surely come when the show is in Bengaluru. I have some work now. Do not talk to me. I am angry with you. Nisha! Father is not coming. If your father watches your drama, that will be the last show. Practice the dialogues first. You can drink beer afterwards. What are you saying? Shall I say my dialogues? - Say. Nisha and gang. Come. Wow! You look super! Dialogues are very easy. Just add 'Galu' for everything. Galu! - Kolar language. Just wait and watch. I will perform so well that you will be staring at me. My name is Usha. I stay near Kolar in... What is that? - Therhalli. Nisha! What are you doing? You are trapped in a whorehouse. You should feel sad. Sir! I feel sad. But... I don't know. How to get it? You mean you feel it but not able to express it. - Yes. I mean the same thing. Get involved in the role. Do it. - Okay Sir. Hey! What is your name? My name is Usha. I am from Teerthahalli near Kolar... What are you doing? - I am sorry. But I am not used to eating rice with hand. Get lost. Have you seen poor people? Do you know how they eat? This is rice. This is affection. Eat with love... Like this. You can't. Nobody will say you are crying if you just rub your face. Have you ever seen the sky at least once, since you were born? Why Sir? Why should I see the sky? You should see. Should see everything. You should not see only mobile. You should see the world. Take. Practice. Look... He is condemning me. I will now go and observe the people. My name is Usha. I am from Teerhalli. Teerhalli... I... Excuse me. Give beer. - Which one? Anything. Give me 10 Rs. Oh! Why Madam? Not getting kick? Hey! Give 3 beers to your sister. No... - Take it. You are feeling shy. Drink. - Thanks. Hey! - Hey! Where are you going? Are you teasing her? - Do not speak more. Hey you... Wait. I'm talking with her. - Give way. Idiot! She ran away. Get the bike. Why? - I am sorry. Look in the front. She is here. Come soon. Are you running? Hey! Come here. Come. What happened? - He... We know the rate. Nothing extra. We will pay the correct amount. Drink the beer if you want. Who are you? Your sidekick? Tell her rate. Hold this. Hold it tightly. My hand! Alas! Why are you coming out at this hour and creating tension? You are from which place? What is your name? My name is Usha. Remove everything. - My native is Therhalli near Kolar. My mother's brother Neelkant and his friends said they will get me a job in Hubli. They brought me here and... Then? Oh! I forgot. They brought and left me in a place full of women. Men used to come there at night. They used to eat Biryani and drink liquor. Afterwards they used to sleep. We should not be born as girl. That is why I took a courageous decision and escaped from there. Do not move while talking. Are you doing drama? Poor people's problems. Do you think this is drama? You smell. Are you drunk? It spilled on me when the rowdies were fighting. You were shaking while talking. I thought you are drunk. Are poor people drunkards? No. I could smell. So I said. Continue. Tell. - You say. My name is Usha. I am from Therhalli near Kolar. - You have already told that. Continue further. Continue. Further... - Yes. Further... I am feeling hungry. Please get me food. I will surely give you food. Come. Please leave me. I have to go back to my place. Okay. I will leave you in train or bus station. You can go home. Now I will give you food. Come. I will get you food. Come. Are you from Kolar? - No. Dandupally? - Therhalli near Kolar. For me? - Take. Help me. You give. Give everyone. You also come and take. Take. Grandma! Sit. Eat. Sit down. Is it good? Eat. You gave money when my child was not well. Now I have money. Take. I did not give you money with the intention that you should return it. Give this money to someone who comes to you with problem. If that person returns back the money, say the same thing that I told you. Understood? I am right. Isn't it? You keep it. Take. Eat. Brother! I want food. May God bless you! Go. What is this? You missed your bus, train and food. I will give you homely food. Come. Get up. Do you give them food every day? We do Biryani business. I bring them the left over Biryani. Hold it. I thought you give every day. Where are we going now? Come. I will take you to my house. I will give you food there. You have come late today. I will drink 2 pegs more. Drink. But do not get drunk. Don't you drink liquor? No. I do not have that habit. Do you want some liquor? I cannot bear that smell. Sister! Do you both match? Why are you calling her 'sister'? Is she related to you? I saw her. Felt like calling her 'sister'. And I called. What is the problem now? Sister! You eat. Hello! Do not eat only the curry and throw away this thinking it is plate. This is hard Roti. You should eat along with that. You are right. Oh! I thought it was plate. Bring two plates of food. I like eating like this, looking at the sky. Look at the sky. But put the Roti in your mouth. It is spicy. Do not put it somewhere else. Eat. Are you joking? You are not right. You give liquor to your father! My father spent his whole life for the sake of others. I understand what he likes at this age and act accordingly. He wants to drink. Let him drink. Let him enjoy. This is an odd hour to eat. Eat fast and lie down. Here! Hubli is extremely hot. We are used to sleeping outside. You sleep on my bed. I will lie down. Come. Hey! Open the door. I am here. Appa was on and off once. - What? Heart problem. So I make him do Yoga every day. You also do Yoga. What has happened to me? The spare parts of our body get some exercise by doing Yoga. And your brain gets cleaned up. You will stop talking like a mad person. Do I look like a mad girl? No. I said doing Yoga is good for health. Drop me near Rangamandira. Nanjappa, a person from my native is there. My security guard. I will go back home with him. Or I will find out a job there. There is only one life. We do not remember the past and cannot predict the future. Our destiny is already decided. It is not in our hands. What did I say? Why are you scolding me? Not scolding. I am speaking out of my experience. That is why I said your brain has to be cleaned up. You do not understand what I say. Drink tea. I will leave you in your place. My name is Usha... You are repeating the same words. I know it. DR MALLIKARJUN MANSOOR KALABHAVAN. This is your place. Thank you. I will not forget your debt. Come here. Why is your friend Nanjappa busy seeing the messages? Nanjappa...! Oh Yes... Keep this. - I do not want money. Take it. Go back to your place safely. Bye. See you. - Bye. Where did you go? - I will tell you. Hi! Where did you go? Take my phone. - Thanks. You are already late. Come. My name is Usha. I am from Therhalli near Kolar. My mother's brother Neelkantan and his friend... Take. Take. Eat. Haven't you eaten rice before? Eat slowly. If it gets stuck in your throat and you die we will be in trouble for lock-up death. Wow! You acted well. Super! How could you do this magic in one night?! Tell the truth. Under which Bodhi tree (enlightenment) were you sitting? Tell the truth. How did you become such a good actress in one night? Did you meet Kamalahaasan or Nana Patekar at night? No. I met Power star. - Oh! We have to leave for Bengaluru tonight. Come let us go. - No chance. I am going to stay here for another 3 days. You go wherever you want. In Hubli! - Yes. I want this costume. I will keep it. Okay? - Okay. What do you lack? Why did you do this? Rascal! - Leave him. It was your own uncle who slapped you. Krishna, Why are you feeling bad? We do not bother if we are beat when we were young. But after growing up, even if a person touches us, we feel bad. The Man inside us awakens. Subu Sir, Did I sell our neighbor's jewelry? That is not called sale. It is called robbery. Your uncle provides us everything. Then why do you need money? To do business. Earning money is very easy nowadays. You have background, land and good reputation here. You can earn millions in a second. I have a proposal for Chemical factory. Instead of adding manure for land, you want to add poison. Look! Our village does not need any factory. I will not allow it. Remember. Give us our share. I will do my business. Share! Which share? Everything is clear. Doddamane property is all yours. You should not speak like that. Do you know how much money we can make from Chemical factory? You need not help the farmers. But do not attempt to spoil them. You are born in a good family. Thing only good. Rajeeva! Your brother-in-law is coming from Madras today. We have to send car. Nanjunda! Take the car and go to station. Okay, Sister. Lakshmi! - Yes. Have you given bath to Krishna? I have still not taken bath. I will take bath and come. Does Rajeeva have any other weakness? Saroja's call. What is it? - She says she will give massage. Saroja! Greetings. - Greetings. Remove that. Have you prepared fake bill? Boss, Surya is there. What is this? - Hey Rowdy! Come here. Why did you show this? - What Patil? Your Boss is calling me rowdy. Did you tell the story to him? Why did you beat him? He was wearing lungi and was sitting there drinking. I was patient for some time. After that I did operation. Are you a Doctor? People address my father as Doctor. They are not calling me now. But they will address me in future. My men complain against you. They are asking why I have spared you. You will not get a good person like me even if you search. What is the matter? They say they will kill you. Let them kill. Baby! What is your name? Father! Father! If you were not here today, I would have lost my whole family. You came like God and saved all of us. God and Police come after the person is dead. I am a human. I have come little early. Do not know whether it is right or wrong. Still you are God who saved us today. Never mind. Baby is crying. You go. Go. - Come. Can't understand what he is saying... - Madam, Where is Food street? Go straight. Original note? - Yes. Usha Madam! Have you not gone back to your native? - No. Shopping with Nanjappa, the security? He is not Nanjappa. Then who is he? He gave money and called me. She is Lady Police. She will take you and cut it. She has taken Three hundred rupees. Help me. How much have you got? Run! Madam! I am going. - Okay Girls should not be born in a poor family! I will show a way to girls from poor family. Come. No. I am not such a girl. Even I am not such a person. Come. Come. Sit. I have seen so many things in Hubli. I cannot leave you. Sit and relax. How are you? - Fine. Where is your father? - He has gone to Bombay. He made huge profits in his sale and has gone to Bombay! Come. This is my shop. Except I am not its owner. Show some good dresses to her. You go and see. - Madam, Come. You are the only male in this shop. - Is this okay? Take. You are fair. You will look good in whatever you wear. Give this. - Okay. Grandma! Are you fine? - I am fine. Met your son in jail last week. He told me to give this money to you. Thank you. I have taken this. Keep the cash carefully. Go and drink tea. You come. This roti is made out of Sorghum. Hubli special. It will taste good. You gave me dresses. Gave flower. Now will you show me movie. Shall we become one family in the same way? Don't you speak without using the word 'Galu'? Okay. I will not add 'Galu' while talking. I thought you are giving silk sari when you got dresses for me. Will give for your marriage. Don't worry. Means?! Means marriage. My marriage! - Yes. With whom? - With the person you like. Are you marriage broker? I will turn into a marriage broker. I will perform your marriage, baby shower, naming ceremony etc. Greetings! Greetings! How are you? - Fine. Finished eating? - Yes. How many languages do you know? I can speak all languages spoken in Karnataka. There is nothing like yours or mine. Everything is His. I am Him. I couldn't follow. - It is Telugu. There is nothing like yours or mine. Everything is His. I am Him. Vijay Dinanath Chauhan. Father's name is Dinanath Chauhan. Mother. - Suhasini Chauhan. You eat now. If we eat double banana, twins will be born to us. Who said? - My Grandma. Grandma! - Yes. Let us see. Eat. You take care of one child and I will take care of another. When we were small, if we had eaten tamarind seeds we were waiting for the plant to grow from stomach. But it did not grow at all. This is true. I am not joking. Can I come here often to see you? Of course, You can come. Why should you think if you want to look at the sky? Come. See. And go. Rathi, Have you loved anyone? Shut up. Why should I do such a sinful thing? Naughty girl! How is 'Love you', 'Miss you' told in your local language? I know 'Love You'. What does 'Miss you' mean? Okay. Tell for 'Love you'. I like you very much. One second... I will record it. Wait. Okay. Repeat. I like you very much. I love you. If you do not agree, I will drink poisoned milk and die. What is this poisoned milk? - Poisoned milk. Okay. This is love spot for Hubli lovers. This place is used to express love and for break ups. Is it?! - Weather is good and we are also in a good mood. Say whatever you wanted to say. Like this place very much. I will tell frankly whatever I feel. Say if you want someone who can speak in English. I will not come your way. But I will say whatever I feel. I like you very much. Shut up. I will push you in water if you speak like this. Do not refuse. If you do not accept me, I will drink poisoned milk and die. What is meant by Poisoned milk? Who knows? Then drink and die. My body and mind is yours from now. 'Madiko' Not 'Madiko' . Marry me. No... Marry me. Marry me. I will take good care of you. You will die of happiness. - Die of happiness! Why are you talking about death? We love to live. Why are you so fast? You should be humble. Is love necessary for people like us? Are you saying this because I am poor? - Oh! Shouldn't poor people fall in love? Enough. Love is not anyone's personal property. Anybody can love. You also love. Will you love me? - I can't answer if you ask suddenly? One minute... Can I hug you like this? What did you do now? I asked if I can hug you like this. Ask again. Can I hug you tightly like this? You have held me tightly now. Ask some other thing. Can I kiss you? Weather is pleasant. Give. Bank will give you loan on my recommendation. But when you get money after harvesting the crops you should be responsible enough to repay the loan. If you agree to that, I do not mind. I will get you loan. Still you keep these documents. Take it. What is this? Farmers believed my uncle and gave these documents. See what you can do with this. What shall I do with this? We can take loan from Bank with this. What did you say? I said we can take loan from Bank. I got an idea. - What? I know a Bank Manager. Let us pledge these documents in Bank and take loan. If we do not pay back the loan Bank people will take Police and seize the land. Villagers will enter the house. They will ask Rajeeva about the documents. Rajeeva has pledged our Land documents and taken loan from Bank. Which documents? - Now, Where are the documents? In the Bank. There will be fight. Police will arrest Rajeeeva. You do not remain silent when they take your uncle. You support your uncle and start a fight. There will be tension. Nobody will doubt anything. He will come out of jail easily with his Power. He is right. He will get bail easily. If I kill that Bank Manager... He will not get bail because they will argue that he may destroy the witness. Rajeeva has to remain in Jail. Your uncle is eating jail food but are you eating chicken here? Good. It is his fate. What can we do? Subu! Nobody else is trying for bail. Right? They will try. But he will not get. O God! Usha! Usha Madam! - Hello! Usha Madam! Lower the glass. What is this? Red color car... English Music... Dance... What else should I see? - That... Have you finished eating? Wait. Surya... Where will you go? You have to come to me. Surya! Surya! You acted well. I should greet you and break a cocoanut on your head! I fool everyone. But you fooled me. Sorry. I am really sorry. Are you acting? Double acting! There you are Usha. And here Nisha. 2 plaints there and Jeans pant here. I was in that get up when I first met you. Then this get up... So I maintained that. Maintain. Go to hell. This is my first love. No one had responded to my love before. But you accepted it. Let us end this where we started. Sorry. Don't touch me. Go back. Surya! Please... Do not come in front of me again. Get lost. I am Surya. You have seen my 1st part. Not my 2nd part. No need to see. - Surya! I was fine. Why am I shaking? Do not come to me again. Go. Sorry Surya. Please... Surya! Surya! Do it slowly. Dirt is falling on me. Uncle, Greetings! - Who are you? Usha... Not Usha. Nisha. Was it you who had come the other day? Yes, Uncle. If Surya had seen you like this, he would have spit on you. He has already spit. You speak to him. I explained to him. But he got angry and went away. What can I do for that? He must be angry. You must have done something. So he must have got angry and left. Uncle! What happened? Uncle! Alas! Bring water. Fast. Uncle! This two.. - I will do that. Greetings! - Are you fine? - Yes. Take. You go. Thank you, Sir. - Come. Sit. Never mind. Surya has come. Get something to eat. Will you eat Biryani? - No. Patel Sir, Father... What happened to him? Heart attack. He has to be operated. What do you want from me? I want some money. I will pay interest for that. Look what sort of deals we get. You have to do the job. That's all. What should I do? If you kill him in Jail, they will pay you 1.5 million Rs. They have already sent contract killers to jail. Whoever kills first will get the amount. You cannot do it. Your life will be spoiled. Do not do this job. I will do this job. I will go to jail. Wait. I will make arrangements for you to come out of jail. Greetings! Are you fine? I am fine. One of my boys is coming there. Make arrangements for him. You go. I will give money for father and go. You go. I will handle everything. Finish the work and call me. Vajramuni! Move aside. How dare you fight in jail? To which gang do you belong? Sir, He is my son. Surya! Do not touch me. I know why you hate me. But didn't you feel like seeing your mother? I do not want anybody's love. You should hate me. Do not change your character by showing your affection. I will give something even now. Will you beat me? I wanted you to reach a high level in society. So I brought you up with discipline. I was beating you. Was it wrong? Not wrong. But you were beating me even before I said that I have not done anything wrong. That was wrong. You left me in water to die. I died on that day. Were you right? You will know at the right time why I brought up Krishna instead of my own son. But why did you save me today? I am not hard hearted like you. What is your case? I came to take some rest. Is this a resort where you can take rest? What is your case? Social service. You rowdy! Are you giving your money for my treatment? I do not need your help. - Sir, Please... Get out. - Uncle! Be careful. Do not shout. You go. Please... Go. Will you take me to jail? It seems there was a murder attempt on Rajeeva in jail. Who did it? He is asking. Tell. Who else? I arranged it. He is a cobra. He is poison. He will arrange contract killers to even kill us, if we are not alert. Hey Babu! My uncle should not live. That's all. You first cancel those contract killers. Take. Call your boys and tell them it is cancelled. Are you getting proper food here? I lost my taste after eating your bland food. Here everything is super. Are you joking here also? Just 2 more days. You will get bail. Will surely get bail after coming to jail. I will come out in the same speed that I came in. You do not worry. If our son was here, he wouldn't have kept quiet after seeing you in jail. Keep quiet. Why are you crying now? Did he kill anyone and get into the jail? Look at him. He is relaxed in jail. Is everything okay inside? First class. Surya must be looking like that boy if he had grown up. Isn't it? Not 'like that boy'. He is our Surya. Surya! Surya! Come here. Do not joke. Is he our Surya? Who else will call me Vajramuni? He is Surya. Surya! He has grown up. Surya! Where did you go all these years? Did you not think about any of us? Surya! Please do not cry. Uncle, Are you fine? Fine. Why are you inside? Sir! Didn't Vajramuni get bail? No. Murder happened on the day of his arrest. He is not being given bail because he may destroy the witness. Just 2 more days. He will get bail. Ask him. Why is he inside? He cannot change his nature. Let him be like this. Leave it. You keep quiet. Why are you inside? Father! Come here. She is my mother. He is Uncle Nanjunda. He is my Mother's husband. Hey! You are crossing the limit. Why? If she is your mother, I am your father. How dare you refuse to address to your father as 'father'? You have taken care of our son carefully all these years. You are our God. You are Great. You are God. He is a wonderful son. But why is he in jail? Sir It is for my sake. Uncle Nanjunda! Take him to hospital. Okay. Come. I will go. Take care of father. Why should he take care of me? This is jail. Everyone is equal and get the same food. Don't worry. Nanjunda will take care. What disease does he suffer from? Why do you stare like that? If we find out about his disease then we will do a better treatment from a good doctor. Do not tease. My father is God for me. Then am I a ghost? Do you love him so much? Look at my face and talk. You can go afterwards. You just stare at me when I ask you about his disease. - Time over. Wait. I am seeing him after many years. We are talking. Do not hurry up. Wait. What is his occupation? He gives food for those who are hungry. We? Do we feed people whose stomach is full? He is a simple person. Not a social worker like you who has given away whatever he has and is in jail now. You are such a person. Face it. We belong to Doddamane. We know only to give. We do not expect anything. Yes. You are experiencing the consequences. I will release your land documents within 10 days. I will speak to the Police and Bank people. You need not fear. Believe me. We believed Rajeeva Sir but he deceived us. How can we believe a stranger like him? He says that he will pay money to Bank and release our documents. We have to believe him. - Hail Brother Cable Babu! Hail Brother Cable Babu! Hail Brother Cable Babu! Will you really return the documents of the farmers? Of course. 100% I will return. Hail Brother Cable Babu! I can hear people applauding you. Are you happy now? My enemy should be in front of me to see how I am greeted. I will not enjoy if he is in jail. Call back Rajeeva. Do you think Legal system is so easy that you can enter and exit at your will? I will try. I got bail. I am going. What is your case? Tell me if you want. I will get you bail. You manage yours. I will come to jail when I want and get out when I am bored. See you. Be careful. You should not have done like this. We believed you so much. Dirty folks! What do you know about me? Get lost. Go to farm house. Why? I will not step into this place. Go. Start the car. Do not be adamant. Your father has also not come home. Your father is in the farm house. You say you will go to Hubli. Did you see what all happened? This is not right. Should we go to Hubli? Let us stay here. - Do you know about Rajeeva Sir? He is Vajramuni. Who will get back your father's lost honor? People here are saying that they will kill my husband. Who said? Show him. Sister, Do not talk like that. Doddamane is not passing through a good time. You belong to Doddamane. You have to take a decision. You belong to Doddamane. You have some responsibility. You are very smart. Why are you simply staring? Go. Okay. You have admitted father in hospital. I am indebted to you. I will pay that amount. - Why all that? I will come. But no one should know that I am a boy who belongs to Doddamane. Okay. I will come there. But I will step into Rajeeva's house. Nanjunda... - Okay Sister... He has agreed to come. That is enough. Your husband will not be harmed. It seems Rajeeva Sir will not step into this place. How will he come? He has done so many good things for this place. He built this orphanage. Built schools for poor children. And donated land to poor farmers. But you shouted slogans against him. Are you not ashamed? He pledged the documents of farmers in Bank. It was wrong. Shut up. But he donated the land to those farmers. We told Chikkegowda. But he doesn't listen to us. He will listen. You also hear. Rajeeva is not a person without any support. He has a son. Son of Doddamane. He will come. Then you will see. Babu and Doddamane Krishna are conducting this fair. I will not leave you. I will bring you out and kill you. All of you believe me. I will do the job. I will kill you. You need not spend a penny for our village fair this time. If he doesn't pay, kick him. Where are you? I will do in grand scale. - Hello! He has hung up. Otherwise I would have taught him a lesson. You have love and affection for me. There is no one to question him here. He has sent Rajeeva Sir to jail and is ruling everyone. I am quiet because I do not want to enter into trouble. I am the Son of this soil. The clothes and jewelry needed for the Chariot festival are with Rajeeva Sir. We can perform this only if he gives. Boy from Doddamane is here. He is not the son of Doddamane. It is Rajeeva Sir's son Surya. My old friend. Who is this new boy? Can't you see? Why are you pushing me? Are they giving food there? Ganga Thayi Palav Hotel. Owner is Ganga alias Lavanga. Is your name Lavanga? I was once a rowdy. My name was Lavanga then. After coming here, our people cannot pronounce 'V'. They call me Langa. Now I am famous as Langa. Rowdy! - Yes. You? - Yes. God Promise. I have a stitch at back. Will you see? Oh No! Never mind. Come. What is meant by Thayi Palav? I became rowdy because of Palav. I have only mother. No father. Are you test tube baby? No... I was born after my father died. Please do not get confused. I had lot of power in my area. People used to shiver upon seeing me. You became a rebel? - Absolutely. Once incident took place. My mother was working in a rest house. I was not there. Then some 800-1000 people went there in search of me. They pushed my mother in Palav because they could not find me. I got angry. Committed twin murders and went to jail. Have you not reformed after going to jail? Yes, I reformed. I decided to stop being rowdy and decided to open a hotel. This Thayi Palav started at that time. Your Palav is not at all tasty. Do one thing. Bring 5 Kilograms of chicken. We will turn your vegetarian hotel into non-vegetarian. BIRYANI CENTER. NON VEGETARIAN. You have prepared very good Biryani. Taste it. Is it tasty? Super Sir! Where did you learn to cook? It has been many years since I ate such a tasty Biryani. The Thayi Palav which I was preparing all these years was not at all tasty. You please come here daily and prepare this Biryani. This is very tasty. We have to give a name to it. Shall I name it Ragini Biryani Centre? Who gave you money to open this hotel? Doddamane Rajeeva Sir. - Give his name. Sir! His name for Biryani?! Keep as Doddamane Biryani Centre. I will handle anyone who opposes it. Okay. What price should I fix for a plate of Biryani? They are villagers. Charge them a reasonable rate. Shall I fix Rs350 as price? Deduct One hundred rupees from that. I do not give my visiting card to anyone for identification. You have heard about me and seen me. I have spit on you and kicked you. What do you want? Tell me. Did you think that I will grow in stature after bringing you down to this level? People will take a person to a high level. Then they will push him. Tell the reason for which you have come. People want that I should occupy your position and preside over the village festival. A person should be respected and be worthy of conducting a temple festival. Get up. Get out. Get up. Get up. We put the chair for him. Why did you sit? Sit. What do you want from me? Temple jewelry is in your house. We need them for the festival. Nanjunda! Give them whatever they want. Brother! Temple jewelry. I will come and take the previous day. We are new to this. You should encourage us. Shut up! - You keep quiet. Don't talk. Go away. Go. Get up. - See you. He has agreed. - All of you go away. These people believe you and lead their life. Why are you sitting quiet? He is ashamed to look at the local people and speak to them. Why should he live such a disgraceful life? I would have hanged myself if I had to face such a situation. There will be many obstacles for a good deed. You do your work. Don't bother. We are with you. PP1 - Yes. I want exactly a red color car like this. Why? If I thrash a few persons, people will think that Rajeeva has beat the. It is Rajeeva's car... Hey! How do you say that it was Rajeeva who beat you? Red color car. Nobody in the surrounding villages has that car except him. Yes Sir. - Now I understand. All of you support me. Rajeeva is unable to digest it. - Yes. So he has beaten you. We should not spare that drunkard Rajeeva. Law will ask for witness. Did anyone see him beating? But we have been beaten. Laxmamma! Time has come for your problems to come to an end. Still you are sad. Something is nagging your mind. Yes. My son Surya, who left the house, has come back. I am happy. God has not ditched you. But he has not come to our house. He will come. Goddess will bless him and he will come home. Will Surya come home? Will the blemish on my husband be removed? Wicked people have never ruled the country. Everything will be fine. You do not worry. Har Har Mahadev! Har Har Mahadev! Har Har Mahadev! Har Har Mahadev! Something is blocking the chariot wheel. Look for it. This chariot was given by Rajeeva Sir. It will move forward only if someone from Doddamane touches it. Doddamane Krishna is here. Not he. - Then who? Rajeeva's son. He is heir to Doddamane. How will he come? He will come. He has come. I have to just go and bring him. Will this chariot move forward if he comes? - Yes. I will watch that. Go. Send our car. Go. Is he the Sun or Moon? Nothing will happen without God's blessings. Humans may plan but the final decision is His. It is your right to do your duty. The fruit of that is in His hands. Do not think about Sin and Virtue. Surya! Surya! Surya! Sister, Our Surya. You have grown up. Please never leave the house and go away. Where were you all these years? Hubli. Do you remember your past waywardness or have you forgotten? Krishna! Surya used to irritate me before. Both of you should not fight from now. Understand? Eat now See how he is staring at me! Hey! Little more... Brother! Sister is calling. Surya has come home. Tell me. Surya has come home. What about that? - I am extremely happy. I feel very sad. Hang up. That... Finally Surya has come home. Where else will he go? He should come and die here. Can't you speak of some happy news? I have lots. I will tell at night. Did we spend so much money for Chariot festival to glorify that Doddamane boy? Why do you feel bad? Chariot festival went off well. No... - He was preparing Biryani in Hubli. How do you know? We both had a fight. He beat me. Father beat me and son beat you. I will not spare him. I will kill him and drink his blood. Greetings. Sit. I felt that Rajeeva Sir is coming. Doddamane people will stand and talk. You sit. Why did you come? You sit. I will tell. You are not a great person because you are born in Doddamane. I have never thought like that. People give me out of affection. We should never refuse things given with affection. This is the level! Level? This is called Level. Got this level since generations. Doddamane level. My foot! Your father has cheated the farmers. This meeting is being conducted for that purpose. Rajeeva Sir is not a cheap person who will cheat the farmers. As if your father is Raja Harishchandra who used to speak truth always! He is a golden hearted man. Your father is a villain. My father is a villain only to me. But if someone troubles him, I will be a villain to him. Villain gets respect only if the Hero is powerful. You better be like a timid animal. If you start barking or biting, I will hit you like I hit a mad dog. Vacate this place as soon as possible. Hello sir. You should come again next month. I falter little. But I have the strength to stand on my own legs. I will ask you when I need your help. Do it then. Come. Why is he weak? He has to handle lot of problems. Many people come to him for help. His tension has increased. Vajramuni should remain strong. Should not act like a timid person. Reduce little. You father-son duo agree to listen to others. I will call and advise him. Please try to understand. She wants you to understand something. Langa! Love is dangerous. She is more dangerous than that. Double acting. Is it? But she doesn't seem so. Is she Chamundi hills that you can see? Do you know the sacrifices I have made for him? What have you done? I changed my style. Gave up my habits. I was drinking little. I gave up that also. That is wrong. You should not leave that. How can you stop that good deed mid way? Continue it. Please... Correct. Get it. What? - Liquor. Thayi Palav... Biryani centre... Bar and Restaurant. Drinks not allowed inside. Hello! I am definitely going to drink here today. Get it. - Take. We are not responsible if you get drunk. What snacks do you want? Do not tell the names of spare parts to her. Keep quiet. Water? I will vomit if I drink with water. I drink like this. Raw. Raw party. I will hit you. Go home. Are you my husband? Take it. - Thanks. Ask him. Look! I will not commit. If I commit once, I will not listen to my own words. Then do not listen. Saying punching dialogues. Go home. What do you mean? - Surya Sir! I have got used to this drinking habit. You do not become one. It is wrong to consider an unknown girl as Goddess and a girl whom you got as ghost. Accept her. Love is blind, You know. Hands will burn if we drink raw. Dangerous. It is Me. Cable Babu's brother. Karate Manja speaking. Tell me. We have kidnapped a local girl and gang raped her. Do not do such things locally. People will kill you. That is why I am calling you. What shall I do? Is she alive or dead? She is alive. Give drinks to that girl. Tie her face with plastic cover and kill her. Okay Sir. Thank you. This is your father. You have a lover. Call him. Call him here. Hello! Who is that? Surya! - Give. Hey Dude! We have kidnapped your girlfriend. I called you because we wanted to rape her in front of you. Will you come alone or with local people to see the show? I will tell the address. Note it down. What do you call a person who does business keeping a girl in front? Surya! Hey! Drink. No! Please leave me. He should see me enjoying. Wake him up. - Surya! Surya! Wake up. Leave me. Mixing is not proper. Water is more. Give me raw. Give me raw. Limbs will be fractured if I hit when I am normal. Now I am drunk and kicked up. Your whole body will collapse. Come here. Come here. Are you hitting at the back? Hit in front. Give some side dish. Blood is salty. Greetings, Madam. One minute. I will not feel anything if you hit me softly like this Take raw liquor and then hit me. Do you want a girl?! Idiot! Surya! Enough. Come. Come. Let us go. Come. Let us go. I do not drink. They forcefully gave me liquor. I do not drive vehicle after drinks. I respect Law. You hold the handle tightly. What shall I hold tightly? Hold the clutch when I say. I will put the gear. "Why are you so quie" "talk to me." Usha! Usha! - Yes. I am Usha fan. I am Usha fan. You are taking me to a guest house. Are you bringing me to a guest house so that my friends should see me in this stage? You are taking advantage of my young age. Lawyer! Divorce! So soon? We have still not started loving. Do not take up this case. Our love has not yet started. Do not take the trouble of fixing stand. Wait. We have not done any mistake. We should file a case and then come for compromise. He is my father Subramani... Criminal lawyer. Criminal dad. Congratulations. Congratulations. - Security! Who allowed this 3rd class person inside? Who is 3rd class? We are just two of us here. You High class Idiot country brute! Kind your Kannada language. Who are you calling 3rd class? - Security! Don't you have any sense? I will punch your father's face. 307 is half murder case. Am I right Lawyer Criminal? Such a loafer is your friend? Who are you calling as loafer? He is not loafer. You are Loafer. I had lot of respect for you. I was telling everybody with pride that I am a Criminal Lawyer's daughter. Hello Madam, Water please... But what did you do today? Shit. Yes. Original water. You got a phone call. Do you remember? You gave a super idea to rape and then escape from that. Super Father. But who was the girl who was to be raped? It was me. Your daughter. Come inside. Let us talk. I have not come to come inside. I came to tell this. Come. It is difficult to shift from sentiment mood to romantic mood. You have spoiled everything. You have lost your face. Waste! Come. - Nisha Madam, One minute please. Uncle! You have given a wonderful girl as gift to me. Shall I hug you once? Full heat. - Idiot. Will you release me if I get caught in some petty case? You have to release me. How can you leave your son-in-law? Bye. Leaning on your back, I am feeling romantic. I get kicked up by seeing you. You will be spoiled if I do something by mistake. Control Surya. Control yourself, Surya. Can I keep my hands on you? - Yes. I will lie down and sleep. I will only sleep. I will not do anything else. I will tell one more thing when I am drunk. Your Usha character in your double acting role was wonderful. When you came wearing two plaits I wanted to put flowers on it. Is it? - Yes. Finally you lost your balance. You were speaking very sweetly. So I wanted to see your face. I lost my balance. Correct. You will lose balance only at this age. Can you lose balance in old age? Hear this. Manja! Why did you kidnap my daughter? To rape. What are you talking?! Do you have any sense? What has happened now? Suppose my brother had raped your daughte you could have married her off to him. I love my daughter very much. Do not talk nonsense. Did you lose her? My brother kidnapped your daughter to thrash Surya. Please understand that. Did you do all this to thrash Surya? Tell me if you have any other extraordinary idea. I am also responsible for sending your father to jail. Father! You! Will you forgive me? God is there. He will decide the punishment for the sinner. Nisha will stay in Doddamane with my mother. You do not worry about her. You be careful. I know that it was Krishna who stole the documents from our house and did all these things. If you complaint against him, I will prove that you are not guilty. I will not do that even if I die. Why do you love your sister's son so much? She is not my sister. She is like my mother. She brought me up. Educated me and got me married. I thought of earning my livelihood through farming and started doing agriculture. I could earn some money. My brother-in-law had a Printing press. I went there. At that time... I saw fake notes being printed there. My brother-in-law did not listen to me. He left at night and committed suicide by jumping in front of train. My sister was shocked after seeing the mutilated body. She has not recovered till now. My sister's life was spoiled because of the information I gave to Police. You were reminded of the past because of me. No. We should never forget the way we were brought up and the path we tread. I am being accused now. I consider this is as atonement for that sin. Krishna, Tell. Please save me, Surya. Save me. - What happened? Money matter. They have kidnapped me because I did not return. They will kill me. Give the phone to them. I will speak. No. You come here. Come soon. Come soon. Hey Babu! - Tell. You said you will thrash and hang Surya if he comes alone. He is coming alone now. Where? Babu! My family members. My mother and aunt are there. Don't do anything now. I don't care. - No, Babu. Give. Surya! No, Babu. - Leave them. Leave them. Surya! Go! Surya. I told the same thing to your brother. Persons who attack women are not called Men. You know what they are called. Have you got more power because these dogs are supporting you? I got power when I was born. This is Doddamane Power. The people behind you are dogs. They follow me because of affection. I have seen many such shows. I am a Man. So I am standing before you. Man! You?! A birth certificate is given when we are born. There are two columns in that. Male and Female. They have not ticked either of them. They were in doubt. So left it blank. I winked at the nurse as soon as I was born. Call me if you want to attack me. Let us fight single. Instead why this family. It is old style. I will hit your Doddamane in that old style. Save it if you can. Do not talk about touching Doddamane before I was there. Try to touch it after I entered it. I have got a worm from your Doddamane. One minute. Krishna! Come out. Come. Your family should know everything about him. Madam! Do not enact drama in front of my family. If you do, your brother who is in hospital will not survive. Any doubt? I just have to make a call. Your brother will stop breathing. Forgive me. Please... - Why all this? You have realized your mistake. Keep quiet. Do not ask for pardon here. Go and ask your uncle. Why did you do like this? Aunt! Do not beat him. It is not Krishna's mistake. They spoiled his mind. His companions are not good. That's all. Let him not turn out to be like his father. Keep him with you. It is your responsibility to turn him into a human. Why does Krishna hate your father? People call your father their God. But you are not in good terms with your father. You were talking about your family day before... What is it? My childhood memories are with my aunt's son Krishna. 'We both were very naughty.' 'He was naughtier.' 'We were always roaming.' 'Krishna used to do whatever I objected to.' 'Krishna! Do not light the matchstick.' 'He used to light fire. But I was getting beatings.' 'He used to beat me before I could say I didn't do anything wrong.' 'Whenever Krishna used to do mistake, It was me who was beaten.' 'I bought this for Ten rupees.' 'You are not the son of Doddamane.' 'He used to always taunt me by saying that I do not belong to Doddamane.' 'After my uncle's death, aunt became mental.' 'My mother was taking care of Krishna.' 'My mother used to take care of me before.' 'Now she forgot me and started taking care of Krishna.' 'Vajramuni!' 'Why are you calling me by his name?' 'Drinking is bad habit. But you drink.' 'That is why I called like that.' 'Father bought a new car.' 'I and Krishna sat on that and were feeling very happy.' 'Krishna started the car one day.' 'We both tried a lot to get out of the car.' 'We lost our fear after seeing my father in water.' 'thought he will first save me.' 'But my father took out Krishna first.' 'I understood that my father does not love me and does not like me.' 'I said that Krishna started the car.' 'But no one listened.' 'Really I did not drive the car.' 'You are lying. I have told you many times.' 'Mother! Mother!' 'Mother!' 'I did not drive the car.' 'Vajramuni! You will repent this.' 'Since they do not love me' 'I decided not to stay with them and left the house.' 'I came to Hubli.' 'I was lying in Railway station without food.' 'Take.' 'Eat' 'Hey! You have fever.' 'Eat this rice.' 'Eat it.' 'I will eat if you give me some work.' 'You need strength to do work.' 'Eat this first.' 'From that day I started calling Mallanna Gowda as father.' It has been many years since I called my father as 'father'. You have got the affectionate nature from your father. There must be a strong reason for his doing a mistake. Why can't you take care of your father with affection? My plan will not miss this time. I will hit without actually hitting. Who do our village people respect more? Women. What did the teacher say on that day? We should not spare that drunkard Rajeeva. We have to give complaint and put him behind bars. I will use the teacher and play the game. What is Rajeeva's weakness? Drinks. His drinks must go from our place. We should drowse and kidnap the teacher in red car in public. He will drink and lie down flat. I will make the teacher lie down beside him. I will make it public. They will spit on him. They will thrash him. And they will kill Rajeeva. They are burning the cars. Let it be. They are entering the house. He is dead. They have brought him out and are thrashing him. What happened? They are thrashing Rajeeva. Hey! Do not plan too much. They are thrashing your brother. Go and save him first. Are you kidnapping our girl? Leave. Leave. Do not beat him. Chikkegowda! - Leave. Leave. Leave. Hey Chikkegowda! He is my brother. Are you beating him? Do you think we will keep quiet if someone touches our girls? We will kill him. SI has called. Hello! - How is your brother? I heard there was some commotion. How do you know? Lawyer called and asked if your brother's case has come up. He said they have thrashed him so much that he may die. He asked me to find out if he is dead. Manja! Boss! Give water. Manja! Give water. Give water. I heard there is some problem between you and your daughter. What is the matter? She left home. Nowadays you are not telling me your pain. She is not my daughter and I am not her father. And Surya is not your son-in-law. Rajeeva is not your relative. Isn't it? - Babu! Leave all this. You and Surya are responsible for my brother's death. Do you want me to spare you? Your last call was to your son-in-law! Tell me Uncle. Say in Kannada, Dear Son-in-law. Babu! - Yes. Babu. Cable Babu. Father-in-law and son-in-law together assaulted my brother. He is dead. He is dead now. No male member will survive in Doddamane. I will kill them one by one. Krishna... Rajeeva... I will not spare anyone. I will attack both. Save whom you want to. Death awaits you. Come. Surya is calling. Take. Speak. Full love! Yes, Surya. Give phone to Uncle Nanjunda. - He just left. Call him. Do not send him anywhere. What is the matter? Tell me. Do not stay in farm house. Go somewhere else. Why? What will happen? Babu called and said that he will thrash you and Krishna. He told me to save you, if possible. Why should I leave my farm house for that reason? If you love your father so much, come and save me. My son... I will not come to you. I am going towards Krishna. Why? I have promised aunt. I did the same thing on that day. If I had saved you, people would have said that Rajeeva saved his son but left the other boy to die in water. Do you understand now? We belong to Doddamane. We serve food to others first and then eat. You do not worry about me. All the best. Bye. Father! Hello! Father Please... Take the call. Hello Surya! Good news. Your father is hurt. You should lose one thing to get another. I will not allow you to light his funeral pyre. I will burn him. You take care of other rituals. Light the fire. Bro! What happened? Surya! No. I fall at your feet. You belong to Doddamane. Don't do it. There are many things to be done by you. You go from here. PP! Come. PP! What is this?! I have brought the farmers' documents. You give it to them. Vajramuni! Get up. Do not be marred by the fact that father and son hated each other till the end. Father! I have not eaten a single morsel from your hand since my childhood. I feel like eating now. Father! Get up. Father! You have spoiled the reputation of a father. What happiness did you give me since my childhood? I stayed in some other place. Called some other person as father. Wore other's clothes. This should not happen to my son. Means to your grandson. You should teach him cycling swimming, run around with him on your shoulders and feed him Are you angry? Are you angry with me? Okay. I will not call you Vajramuni again. You call him Vajramuni once. Sir! Sir! You always used to say that your son doesn't address you as father. Open your eyes. He is calling you 'father'. Call him 'father' once more. Father. Father. Sir. Mother. Father! Forgive me. Chikkegowda! It is the person above us who is playing the puppet. It is true. - He knows what to do. My son has returned your documents. - Yes, He has given. All of you be happy. Gowda! Where are you going? Kashi, Rameshwaram... On pilgrimage. You have come to the right decision. Do one thing. - Tell me. You are old. I will get them married. Take them along with you. Instead of sending him somewhere else after marriage why should I take him to Rameshwaram. What do you say? - I wanted to come to Doddamane and speak about this alliance. You have told it. You also find out a girl. Let us perform two marriages together. Let his marry first. I will watch him and then I will marry. Your daughter has become Doddmane daughter-in-law. Let us select an auspicious date and perform their marriage. Father! Come and do some steps. Our steps are different. You dance. I will stand behind and see. Come and do some steps. Let us enjoy. Come.
