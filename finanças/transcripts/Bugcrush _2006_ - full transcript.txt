When I lived on the coast with my mom ... ... was always to take as long walks ... ... and behind our house was a forest. And I ... well, it was the only place in the I could be alone. The guy pulled my mom was a fool, I slept on the couch ... ... so I do not want to be in the house One day I was walking through the woods y. .. and I realized that I was far away and alone. He was lying ... ... In the leaves ... I stared at the sky and trees, and began to masturbate. When I was about to come to me ... ... I felt like a little bite. -- Do not hurt right? -- No. I want to show this. Relax. I felt this bite on my leg and saw it was a fucking bug biting. Like a worm or something, this big. Before you know it was happening my leg fell asleep and scared me ... I was thinking: 'Shit, this guy is poison! " "I will die here and nobody is going to find. " "Let me think about my mom found half naked with a peak outside. " Luckily I found you. Anyway ... I could not do anything because whatever it was was very intense. And without realizing what it was I was having the best trip of my life. I realized it came from the bug. That little bug. And I started thinking: "Shit if I die here is good because ... ... this is the best " You can not be serious. Ben, I'm talking totally serious. The strange thing is that it was still hard. And you know what I did? What did you do? -- Suit the worm here. -- It's really enjoyable, Ben. I hate bugs, but these are worth it. In the meantime we will to your room and get high for a while.
