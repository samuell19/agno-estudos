[tense music] [energetic music] [mellow ambient music] - This is Agent Vincent Coletta, audio log entry at 2100 hours and two minutes. Signal interceptors steady. Perimeter is secure and Peter is asleep. [alarm beeping] Ah, shit! What now? [tense music] Who the hell is that? Now, be smart man, don't do it. - I can't believe I'm lost again. - Just get on your bike and get the hell outta here. [device beeping] What now? Incoming? Holy shit, I hope this isn't true. [meteor zooming] [explosion bangs] Emergency report at 2100 hours and five minutes. I was tracking a possible intruder outside defense line at sector 12 when radar indicated an inbound object. I didn't get a good look at it but I think it was a meteor. I cannot tell if it landed inside or outside the perimeter. Alarm is still quiet. I'm going to investigate. [tense ambient music] [motorcycle engine revving] [rumbling] [screeching] [swooshing] [screeching] [tense music] All secure, I am heading to southeast to check on Peter. All secured, I'm gonna check the-- [alarm beeping] Ah shit! Perimeter alert at sector 12, I'm on my way. [tense music] [humming] Recording from sector 12 2100 hours and 22 minutes. Perimeter has been breached. We have a red security alert. Intruder is riding a motorcycle. Jesus, probably the biker at large in there. How the hell did he burn through that fence? [suspenseful music] Who the hell are you? You are on government property! [zapping] [gunshot bangs] [engine revving] [tense music] [zapping] [explosion bangs] [tense music] Ditco! Ditco! I've sighted an engaged intruder. I don't know what's going on. I thought it was the guy in the dirt bike but I don't know what the hell it is. I fired at it at point blank but it had no effect. Oh, shit! [suspenseful music] [gunshots bang] [zapping] I'll try to make it to Peter! [suspenseful music] [gunshots bang] [somber ambient music] [knocking] - Sergeant Kirby! Kirby, General Hubert wants to see you in his office ASAP. Don't forget to shave. - I have made you team leader. You'll have rank and you will have the mission. You think you can handle that? Not that you have a choice. - Yes, sir but how do I-- - This mission does not exist, you understand? The. The covert nature of this operation precludes any active duty Marine from participation as well as the knowledge of the mission by the Defense Department. So officially, it doesn't exist. - Understand, sir. - Oh, I know you, Kirby. I've been following your career. As far as I'm concerned, you are the perfect man for this mission. - Thank you, sir. - Now, you will follow the direction of a CIA. - CIA, sir. - That's right. His name Mr. Wood. You will follow his direction but the mission is yours. You'll take responsibility if the shit hits the fan. - Yes, sir. But is there anymore you can tell me about this, sir? - I'm afraid not. Mr. Wood will fill you in. Now, listen, Kirby. Technically, you're still suspended from action, so let's not make national news out of this. Keep it simple. Get in, and get out and don't try to make up for past mistakes. If all goes well, I maybe able to get you reinstated. - Yes, sir. About my team, sir-- - Don't need to worry about that, son. It's all been taken care of. [mellow music] - You know, when you think about it, it's like we're out own kind of Fantastic Four. You see, you're like Johnny Storm. - What, the Human Torch? - Yeah, you know, fire on the outside. Just kind of a little punk kid on the inside. - Screw you! - No, no, no, listen, listen. Our fearless leader, he's like the Thing, you know. Clobbering time. [chuckles] - It's like the Invisible Woman just walked in the door. - Yeah, although she looks pretty damn visible to me. Thank you. - Dr. Lee to you, Private. - Well, if I'm the Human Torch and she's the Invisible Woman and Sarge is the Thing, who are you? - Well, I'm Mr. Fantastic. - Attention on deck! At ease, Mr. Fantastic. - Sir. - People, this is Sergeant Kirby, the team leader on this mission. Sergeant, I believe you know Private Frazetta and Buscema. And then Dr. Adams will be helping us out with any forensics. This Dr. Lee. She's a loan from the Second Sight program. [tense music] - Nice to meet you, Dr. Lee. - Second Sight? - A telepathic and psionic research. - Yeesh, mind reader. - Then there's Mr. Wood. He will be-- - I'll be supervising this mission. Our destination is Prairie Dog Colorado. A little tourist reserve deserted since the '50s. We had one agent stationed. Now, this has been a secured government compound but we have reason to believe that that security has been breached and our man is, well, dead, wounded or has possibly deserted his post. Our job is to find him. Assess any possible threat, eliminate it and secure the area. We'll be dropped off approximately three miles from the perimeter and enter the compound on foot. Now, this is a radio silent mission. The helicopter is scheduled to return in 36 hours. If we're not at the rendezvous site within 20 minutes of landing, they will take off. And the area will be eradicated by aerial assault, so, please don't lose your watches. Questions? - Yeah. This is a potentially dangerous mission, why are we taking civilian then? - Sorry, Sergeant, that information is on a restricted need to know basis only. Anything else? Okay, let's do it! [mellow music] - [Kirby] Lieutenant, you take point. I'll bring up the rear. - I hope this isn't a long one. It's hot as hell out here. - What's the matter, Frazzy? Didn't bring your comfy shoes with you? - Knock it off, you two, let's try to act like Marines. - [Buscema] Trying, Sarge. [birds tweeting] [mellow ambient music] [Lee shrieks] - Move on, I'll handle her. - Thanks. - Dr. Lee, you're going to have to keep up. - So, Sergeant, who's Corporal Geordino? - You're practicing your mind reading techniques already? - Not exactly. [tense music] So, is it normal to wear someone else's tag? - That would be a need to know basis. You coming, Dr. Lee? - Colorado loom. - Beat me. - Not you, man. The birds. - Christ, I hate nature. - Hey, cut the chatter up there, guys. Hey, Wood. Is the man on a motorcycle? - No. Only vehicle on the compound is a truck. - Somebody's in here, I wonder. Let's keep moving. - All right, right here, this is it. Spread out. All right now, Sergeant, you gonna have to keep your men back. I'm the only one authorized to approach. - Mr. Wood, with all due respect, that house hasn't been secured. You don't have any idea if there's anything in there. - Just do what I say, Sergeant. I'll inform you when it's secured, though. - This pile of bull is top secret? Looks like a frigging outhouse. [tense music] [tense music] Figure somebody cut his throat in there? Yeah, no such luck. [tense music] - So, this telepathic insight of yours, how good is it? Can you tell what's happening in there? - Sometimes, it takes a little while to connect. Other times, it happens instantly. Telepathy is only a part of what I do. A better term would be psychometry. You see, all objects possess an inner life. They remember things about the events and people they come into contact with. Impressions of an individual can be transmitted to an object which that person has in his possession. Those impression can be transmitted to other persons and even objects. When I touch an object, I receive these impressions. It's as though I were a television receiver. I see the recorded events like watching a TV show that glides in my soul. - How did one come by this talent? You have to be stuck by lightning, blessed by god, what? - Anybody can do it. But very few do. [tense music] I'm sorry about invading your privacy back there, Sergeant. I didn't know, I-- - Forget it, Dr. Lee. - You have a lot of pain inside of you. - Stay out of my head, doc. Unpleasant place to be. [tense music] - Dr. Lee, doesn't it bother you? - What? - Intruding on people's privacy. It's rather unfair. I mean, are you the only one entitled to keep secrets? - Do you have secrets? - Of course, everyone does. But one shouldn't go when one has not been invited. And I would very much appreciate it provided that you can read minds but you stay out of mine as well, all right, doctor? - I do, doc - Who wanna read your puny mind? [tense music] - I don't wanna panic anybody. - Ooh, spider senses tingling. - Dr. Lee, I prefer you stay close to us. - That is wild. I can't make sense to this, it's like I'm hearing a foreign language but backwards but there's some English in it like two voices in one head. - Mouth shut, eyes open. Frazetta, northeast corner. Buscema, top left edge. Tell me what you hear. - I'm not sure. It's like a chattering static. - Can you get us a direction? - No. Kirby! [motor revving] [gunshots bang] [gunshots bang] [tense music] [gunshots bang] [zapping] [gunshots bang] [zapping] [gunshots bang] [zapping] [tense music] - Frazetta, get to Buscema, he's been hit! Dr. Adams, make it to the cabin. Let's go! [somber music] - Come on, come on! [grunting] - Wood! Wood! Wood! Dr. Adams, check on Buscema. - People are not authorized to be in here! - Screw your authorization, Wood! Didn't you hear what was going on out there? - I heard it. - Then what? You were too busy to help us out? I got a wounded soldier here. - It doesn't look too deep. He's gonna be all right. - Good. Frazetta, check the back door. - All right. - It's a bit warm in here for a fire, isn't it? - We all have our order. - Yeah, and just what are those? Just another damn cover up if you ask me! - It doesn't concern you. - What does concern me is there's a maniac on a bike out there! - You have your orders. I suggest you follow them. - I wanna secure the perimeter. [somber music] [tense music] - Dr. Lee! Dr. Lee! Could you give me a hand, please? [energetic music] - I don't trust that dude any farther than I can throw him. - Sir? - Keep an eye on him. Had some experience with these CIA operatives before. - Yes, sir. - Frazetta, you okay? - Fantastic. - Here you go. These should help ease the pain. - Did you really hear something from that rider or were you grandstanding right there? - No, I, I don't know. - What are you talking about? - I heard something I've never heard before. - Why don't you just tell us what you heard? - Something loud like two voices running together. One human, one, I don't know. - Shit, biker from hell. - Are where patched through to Henderson Air Force base? - Oh, you're not authorized to use that equipment. - Yes, I know. - Sergeant, you heard me! - I heard you, Mr. Wood and I appreciate that this is a need to know situation but right now, we need to know a hell of a lot more than we do! I can't walk into a black hole and I can't ask squad of this size to follow me there. We're calling for reinforcement. - I brought you along because I thought you're an officer who knew what it meant to follow orders. - I had my orders, to carry out my mission, to render this area secure! Now, Mr. Wood, give us the information. Tell us what we need to know to carry out our mission or I'm gonna call in the cavalry and let them decide how to deal with it. I-Team Special to Henderson. Three kilo three. - What makes you think I know any more than you? - Three words, C-I-A. - Okay. This is a listening post and we tapped in a very confidential transmission. - It's a big surprise. - Yeah, but there are people, organizations that would give anything to get access to these machines you've heard. And clearly, someone has come looking. - So, what are you saying? This is some kind of secret agent? Some kind of foreign spook? - With those laser beams and shit? - We have lasers, we have body armor. Obviously, somebody has the same, a bit more advanced, I admit but seriously, what else could it be? Well, this post is now secure but we still haven't found Agent Coletta and that rider or whatever it is still out there. Now, you need to capture or kill and I can't tell you a damn thing how to do that. That's your specialty. - [Kirby] Is there any else that you're not telling us? - Not to my estimation. - Dr. Lee, what's in his head? - [Lee] Nothing. - I could've told you that. - Everything he said feels that it's been memorized. When I try to go deeper, all I get are math equation, bus schedules. - Bus schedules? - He's blocking me. Now, he's reciting the Pledge of Allegiance. He's been been trained to resist having his thoughts read. I just can't get through him. - CIA feels the best offense is a good defense so yes, I have been trained to block mental intruders. Now, if we can dispense with the amateur theatrics, maybe we can get this mission going. - All right, Wood, but do yourself a favor, don't ever assume that I'm bluffing. - Yeah, I'll take that under advice, man. - Adams, Lee, you're going with us. Buscema, stay here with Wood. I don't want you down there until we've done a complete sweep of the town. - Now, just hold on! - Buscema, if he moves, shoot him. - You don't have the authority, pal! - Maybe not but you can take that up with the commission when we get back. Right now, you'll do as I say. We'll radio you when we get down to the town unless of course, there is something down there. Something you don't want us to know about. - As far as I know, it's just a town. - Right, Buscema, you keep an eye on things. You stay here till you hear from me. If you don't hear from me in two hours, you make that call to Henderson. - Yes, Sergeant. [tense music] - [Kirby] All right, wait here. Let me go check it out. - So, Adams, a lab rat like you seen much action in the forensics? - Not really. The closest I've been to firearms is the Orange County gun show. Usually, by the time I show up, the bad guys are long gone. - Dr. Lee, you hear anything which you know about? - The birds and the trees, for the moment, all is right with the world. - Yeah, that's always the way it is and boom! Like this shows up. - [Kirby] It's all clear. [tense music] - Well now, this is counterproductive. I mean you are a soldier guarding a US agent. We're on the same side, for Christ's sake. - Just following orders, sir. Mr. Wood, don't think you'll be needing that little bundle under your coat there. - Never hurts to be ready. - Well, if you wouldn't mind, sir, would you please hand over the weapon? - I'm not about to take orders from you, Private. - Consider the order coming from my friend, mister nine-millimeter here, sir. If you very gently toss that aside on to me, I'll really appreciate it. Gently. - You're a good soldier. [tense music] - Why do I suddenly feel like clammy, sir? Breeze at Madison County Eastwood, of course. - Why don't you try feeling like a Marine and shut up? Let's just apprehend this perpetrator and go home. - Here's your blood, Sergeant. Figure it's less than 72 hours old. - It's like he's lost a lot of blood. Think this is fatal? [gunshots bang] Frazetta, Christ! You just let the whole world we're here. - Sorry, Sarge. Let's move, just tell me. - Kirby. I'm feeling something. [motor revving] - Get inside! Go! [gunshots bang] [gunshots bang] [suspenseful music] [zapping] Frazetta, take the back door! - Right! - Doctor, you getting anything? Doctor, let's get away from that window! - No, no, he's trailing, he's moving off. - Good. - All tight. We're not gonna make a stand here, are we? - We're surviving here about two minutes trying to defend ourselves from that son of a bitch. Dr. Adams, we're gonna need your help. - I'm not a commando! - No shit but we need all the help we can get! Ready? Let's move. [suspenseful music] You and Frazetta on the second floor. Doctor, as you see or feel anything, radio me. Frazetta, you're sniping. - Cool. - Dr. Adams, you stay right here. If he comes around from the back, you'll be the first to see it. Wait, you just point this in the general direction of anything you wanna kill. Pull the trigger. I'll be the running target. Let's go! [suspenseful music] - Are you worried? - Hell, yes. Wood, that son of a bitch. He's one of the liar of the spook. Don't be telling me that somebody's gonna come in here on a covert snatch and grab right in some freaking laser-packing chopper from hell. That's bullshit. - Maybe it's more than that. - Damn right, it is. Hey, doc, we're on the same here, you know. Mr. Fantastic and Invisible Girl. - Supergirl and Superboy. - No, no, no, that's DC, wrong universe, okay? What am I getting at, your brainwaves have told you something. Spill it. - I'm stumbling around the dark just like the rest of you. I can hear the rider but I just can't make sense out of it. - Let's move. [tense music] - We're all clear down here. I wanna proceed down main street, see if I can draw him out. Keep me covered. - Come on. Hold this. - Kirby, this is Lee. All quiet and clear. [suspenseful music] - No sign of him yet. [static buzzing] - Think the Murdercycle's been through here. Hold on just a second. [zapping] Just been tagged. I can't target. Can you see him from your position? - Negative, where the hell was your ESP? - I don't know what the hell I'm hearing. It just keeps changing. - Okay, I'm going to head back the street towards your position. As soon as you can target, fire on his ass. [tense music] - Doctor, could you reach on my pocket? Pull out that clip marked with blue tape? - What is it? - It's Teflon armor piercing rounds. Saved it for special occasions. - Okay, here he comes. [gunshots bang] [gunshots bang] [gunshots bang] [gunshots bang] [explosion bangs] [gunshot bangs] [gunshot bangs] - Well, you're a mighty cool costumer, soldier. Won't you wanna know what all that shooting's about? - Pretty good idea what's that about. - Well, they might need our help. - If they do, Sergeant call. - They maybe wounded not able to call. You don't know. - I know how to follow orders, sir. - Your friends maybe dying. Don't you care? - Mr. Wood, we're not going anywhere. Not me, not you. - [Kirby] You all okay? - So much for fucking Teflon. - What the hell? Sergeant, look at this. - Is that from the bike? - I don't know. It smells like motor oil but it's not oil. - But whatever it is, it looks like we've done some damage. Oh, take a look at this. I found this over by the barn. - Let me see them. [tense music] Whoever this belong to is still alive. - Coletta? - I'm not sure, it could be. The feedback is all fragmented. No complete thoughts. - Well, if its Coletta, he's in pretty bad shape by now. Frazetta, you and Dr. Lee take that side of the building, Adams, you come with me. Let's go! [tense music] - Sergeant, more blood splatter. Whatever it was, they were headed out to that field. - Let's check it out. - Now, you wouldn't really shoot me, would you? - Yes, sir. - You're really something, soldier, you know? [grunts] This wasn't supposed to happen, son. [gunshot bangs] - So, would Mr. Fantastic do in a situation like this? - Hmm, probably invent some rounds that could punch through that son of a bitch on a bike. Or turn himself into a lasso and rope the bastard. So, what happened anyway? Why didn't you hear it? You know, telepath him. - I got confused. For a second, I thought I heard this man. I could make out his thoughts in English and then I realize all of a sudden it wasn't him and I got all confused. - So what was he thinking? - Hard to say. It's like reading a machine. Search for objectives, eliminate opposition, follow orders. - Sure you aren't reading Sarge? - Could've been. [mellow music] - This is Kirby, I found something. - You're a real piece of shit, Wood, you know that? - Quiet, keep moving. - Why'd you shoot the radio, man? That's what I don't understand. At least we could call in for help or something. - No one infiltrates until we've secured the area. - Yeah, no one leaves either, is that it? Listen man, I'm not about to get dead on your account. - What about Kirby, you'd do it for him? - He's a Marine. He's different. I don't know what to make of you. Like I don't even want you on my side. You're just guys in suit who tell lies to people just to keep them from finding out about bigger lies. Tell lies to the point maybe you don't even know what the truth is yourself. - Yeah, welcome the real world, son. - That's not the real world, sir. That's your world. I like my world better. - And Kirby, he's okay on your book? - Yeah, he sure is hell is. - Did you ever tell you why he got suspended from active duty? - No. - Well, let me you in a little secret about your fearless leader. - Think we found our man, Coletta. Or at least what's left of him. - Shit. I ain't never seen nobody messed up like that. You okay, doc? - Yeah, I'm fine. It's just I'm not used to seeing a body like that. - I never expected a forensics guy go green with the first sight of blood. - Yeah. [tense music] - Whoever that biker is, he's the one that killed Coletta. He's being chased through here and then stopped here-- - Oh, I could've figured that out just by examining the forensic evidence. - That's not all. This little device here, this is some sort of key. I don't know what's hidden out there. I don't know if it's native or not but whatever it is, Coletta died trying to protect it. - Hey, maybe this is what he was trying to protect. Steel. - Oh, yeah. - Maybe this is what Wood's been lying about. This is what's he's been hiding up here, and what that rider's looking for. You were reading his mind, what do you think? - I don't know, I keep getting the feeling there's something human in there, then it all turns upside down. - Are you telling me this thing may not be human? - I don't know. There's something alive in there, that's all about I could tell you. - Doctor. - Hmm? - Any thoughts? - I was just thinking I'd like to be around a thousand miles away from here. - Amen. Tell me, Sergeant, what do you think? - I'm thinking I'd like to have about a pound or two of some tef right now so I'd know if that thing came back, I'd be able to kill it. - You sure he'll come back? - Oh, he'll come back. He'll come back for what's on the other side of that door. - Something's coming this way. - [Kirby] Where? - I can't tell. - Let's head for cover. - Right, Sarge. Freeze, don't take another step. - [Buscema] We're on the same side, in case you forgot. - No shit, what the hell are you doing here? I thought I told you to keep him up at the cabin. [suspenseful music] [gunshots bang] [gunshots rattling] [gunshots rattling] [zapping] - Kirby, I think it's all clear. - Frazetta! [gunshots rattling] [suspenseful music] [zapping] [suspenseful music] [grunting] - Just kill me. [mumbling] [gunshot bangs] - This blood's on your hands, Wood. You got that? By disobeying my direct order, you cost a good man his life. - And I'll remind you that you're under my command, Sergeant. - Bullshit! I'm not taking a rap for that! And I'll tell what else. We're gonna go back up to that cabin and we're gonna radio Henderson for an airlift and when they get here-- - Nobody's radioing anybody. - What do you mean? You bastard. You destroyed the radio. - It was my fault, sir. I thought he was escaping and discharged my weapon and I accidentally hit it. - You don't have to cover for this scumbag, Buscema! - You might wanna think a little less about how everyone's out to sabotage you, Sergeant and a little more about how to accomplish the objectives of this mission. - Then why don't you tell us just what the hell they are? Dr. Lee, can you? [tense music] What is it Wood? What do you got hidden away in this little park up here? Toxic waste dump? Illegal arms reserve? How about a spy satellite? [tense music] Dr. Lee? - I'm all right. - Well, we didn't just work out defensive strategies against telepaths, we have offensive ones too. - I don't understand. - He thought about me being raped and killed. Just caught me by surprise, that's all. I can try. Kirby, I'm reading someone else now. - The rider? - Civilian. - Civilian? That's impossible. - Lead the way, doctor. [tense music] Come out and identify yourself now! - [Man] If I come out, you'll shoot me. - If I wanted to shoot you, you're already dead. - [Man] Maybe you just want a clear target. - Get out here with your hands up or this conversation is going to over forever. - All right, take it easy, okay? Okay, take it easy. I'm not one of them. Oh, you're all like Marines. My granddaddy was a Marine. Korea, hey, hey! I'm a brother, fighting against alien invasion. You don't wanna shoot when you all met me. That'd be friendly fire. Persian-Gulf War syndrome. - Are you Peter? - Hell no. - Who the hell is Peter? - Sergeant, I've seen this man before. He has something to do with this place. - Yeah, I'm freedom fighter Ditko, reporting, sir. - So, you're not this Peter guy? - No, sir. Ditko. [suspenseful music] - What do think about this guy? Is he on the level? - Well, I believe what's he saying. - Doesn't exactly fit the profile of a spy. - This whole area is a hot a bed of alien activity. I got my observation place set up couple of miles from here. Some nights, we get three motherships all at once. Gets a little crowded, you know. - This compound's supposed to be secure. I mean no one oughta be able to get within 20 feet without tripping an alarm. - Yeah, yeah, I know, but see, they made a big mistake. Heat sensors, it's useless against a guy who's wrapped himself in frosty packs. I've disabled them along the entire section. I cut the chain and service gain, just drove on in. - Well, you think that's cute? Kid, when we get back, I can have you locked up for five to 10 so I'd advise you to shut up. - What is your problem? Look, Vince and I go way back. Didn't he tell you about me? - Vince who? - Vince Coletta. - Well, for you information, Vince and I go way back. Hell, I'm probably the only person he's talked to the whole time he's been here. I keep him company, we play chess sometimes. Well, between us, he's not much of a strategist if you know what I mean. He didn't tell me you guys where coming in. Where the hell is he anyway? - He's dead. - Mr. Ditko, did you say you came here by car or truck? - Sorry, I got this whole star cruiser on a church at the far side of town but I lost the keys somewhere. - Then these must belong to you then. - Hey, you found them. Hope it still runs. You know, this area, it used to be a nice place to live before ET mothers came in and burned every living soul. It really messed up this place something fierce. I got this trying to save my granddaddy but I wasn't able to. First, I thought it was some military operation, you know, I'm trying to protect that little secret base, now I know. It was a full on close encounter of the totally lethal kind. - Kirby, we got work to do. You wanna listen to this headcase? - Quiet a second. Secret base? You mean Agent Coletta's shack? - No, sir, I... Agent Coletta? CIA. Now, it all makes sense. I should've known. - What secret base? - My dad and me, we saw him in the middle of the night, 23 trucks full of cement, the fences were already up by then, you know. I just figured it was some top secret EBGB operation. - All right, that's it. Kirby, place this man under arrest. - Mr. Wood, if anybody's gonna be placed under arrest, it's gonna be you. - Yeah, you spook! Mister secret agent man. With your freaking CIA issued shoes. - That reminds me, Mr. Wood, I have something I'd like to talk to you about. - Oh, really? - What's that? - I think I have a good idea of where those 23 trucks of cement might have gone to. [tense music] Mr. Wood, it's on the other side of that door. - You're getting way over your head, Kirby. I'm telling you, you don't wanna be involved with this. - Buscema, relieve Mr. Wood of his weapon. - Man has nerves. He's all quivering, he's afraid mama's gonna spank him. Ouch! - Shut up. - He's reciting the alphabet to keep me out. - I hear nothing. - Dr. Lee is a psychic. - Mr. Wood, was on the other side of this door? I said, what's on the other side of this door? Lee? - Still can't get through. [thuds] [grunts] Kirby! - Wood, I'm gonna get what I need out of you. - All right, go on. Go on, let's go there. Come on, let's go there together! - Kirby, please stop, please! - Back off! I'm gonna find out what's on the other side of that door. - Go on, come on, let's see what you got. Killing your own man seems to be a habit of you, doesn't it, Kirby? You didn't think I knew about that? Oh, come on, Kirby. I know everything. Nicaragua, you lost the whole platoon, a man and another CIA operative. Any of these sound familiar? You marched your men right into that ambush. And they all bought except for you. Of course, the inquiry couldn't prove if it was treason or just plain incompetence but we all know what really happened, don't we, Private? - You bastard! Why don't you tell him what really happened? Tell him that the CIA operative led us into that ambush. - Yeah, that's not how the report reads. Suppose we could ask the operative but he's dead! Go on. Go on, cut me. I know you want to. You don't know anything about me. You think you can break me? You have no idea what I'm made of! So you go on, you go ahead. Maybe I'll talk. I don't know but I'm gonna make you pay the price. I'm not gonna let it out easy. Maybe there won't be much left in me when we're done but there's gonna be even left in you. - Wood, tell me about Peter. - Who is this Peter guy you dudes talking about? - An acronym. In his side pocket, there's some sort of key device. - It's just like the one Coletta had. - The code open the door is three, 27, 60. [tense music] - Come on, Wood. You're taking us with you. Buscema, take Ditko, Dr. Adams back to the observation shack. - No, sir, I mean, I might be useful. - Yeah, you might, Dr. Adams but you're going back to the observation shack. Dr. Lee, Wood, you're going with me. - Please, Sergeant, I really must go down there. - Dr. Adams, I don't have time to argue with you. - Hey, you heard the chief. Let's hit the road, dude. - Buscema, make sure you secure the door behind. - Wood. You lied to me. - Sorry, kid. It's my job. [tense music] [tense music] - It's clear. - Didn't like what the sergeant was doing, didn't you? - No. - It's kinda like, well, rape. I mean it's kinda like what I was thinking about you when you were trying to read my mind before. - I suppose so. - You don't like that. You don't like the idea of being raped. - I suppose I don't. - Well, that's funny. What do you call what you do? Every time you violate the privacy of somebody else's mind against their will. You're lucky there were no law about that idea. What do you suppose what happen if they do. What name would they give people who rape other people's minds, doctor? - I don't know. I just know that I didn't want Kirby to keep hurting you. - Oh, yes. Who's sick, mine or his? - Both. - Which way, Mr. Wood? - Oh, back to being mister now. Oh, I suppose you wanna go to the left. [tense music] Allow me to make the introduction. This is Peter. Prototype extraterrestrial tachyon energy regulator. - Extraterrestrial? - That's right. Peter was recovered from a crash site of a UFO in this area some time ago. Most likely a probe that's used to communicate to its home planet. - Is this some kind of radio transmitter? - Huh, it's a lot more than that. It transmits. But it also receives data. - What kind of data? - Everything, physics, computer science, space travel, things that would take us years to discover if ever. Look, this is the heart of the thing. - This is what you've been hiding here? Just how many men were you willing to feed to this sausage grinder to protect your little secret? - For a device of unspeakable importance that reveals the secret of the universe? As many as it took, including me. - Christ. - I was sent here to protect it. At all cost. - And what was suppose to happen of we stumbled across all of these? - Suppose to happen? What makes you think it won't? There aren't gonna be any more missions for us after this, Sergeant. - Jesus, another set up. Just like Nicaragua. - Kirby, I'm picking up something. We're not alone. - You wanna be a soldier? Well then be one! Kill that damn rider! Don't let him discover this is the prize. - Where is it? - I can't tell. - Is there a back way outta here? Is there? - There's a back exit, Sergeant. This way! - No, you two go ahead. I'll buy us some time. - You don't stand a chance alone with that thing. - [Kirby] That's an order. - Good luck. [suspenseful music] - Please don't shoot! - Adams, you idiot! I could've killed you! - I'm not cut out for this sort of thing. - What the hell are you doing down here? - We found something. You better take a look. Where are the others? - There's a back exit here somewhere. Hey, how'd you get down here, anyway? - Oh, the door was open. - Buscema, I told him to make sure that thing was shut. Let's get outta here. [tense music] A meteor? - Hell no, man. This is ground zero for the invasion. What do think is riding that chopper? It ain't Peter freaking Fonda. This is Mr. Saturn come to kick us in our ass. Don't you know anything? - Whatever made this crate, it was small. But whatever it was, it certainly not here now. Maybe it was some kind of-- - Biomechanical parasite that latches on and grabs hold of whatever it can. Then it transforms itself into a-- - Soldier. - [Ditko] Yeah, like I said before, those guys up there are real interested in what we got down here. Real interested. - Gonna be dark soon. Lets get back to the cabin. - Sarge. I let you down. And I let Frazetta down. - Don't worry about it. [motor revving] [suspenseful music] [gunshots rattling] [zapping] - Son of a bitch! [gunshots rattling] [suspenseful music] [explosion bangs] - Kinda creepy being in here without Vince. He never could beat me in chess. Couldn't seem to think down in here. - Don't need anybody go wandering around outside. You'll break trip wire with grenades all around the cabin. Don't know how much good they'll do but at least we won't be surprised. Wood, you gotta tell us what the hell it is we're fighting. You want us to fight, you want us to kill the enemy, you want us to save your little gadget. You can't deny us an enemy profile. - Sergeant, I can give you an enemy profile. It something that has six eyes, four arms and big. - Those poor dumb bastards down at center. They're listening for signs of intelligence while it fools all around them. I mean look at all these monitors. Look at these eyes and eyes ears. Looking at what? What are they listening to? Where do think the technology came from to that technological Satan down in that basement? - Come on, Wood, you're not making any sense. - That sphere, Peter! It caps an all-power that diminishes our technology to nothing. Source more powerful than all of our nuclear technology combined and multiplied exponentially. We accidentally tapped in, we learned how to read it. And nobody knows about it but us. Not the president, not the Congress, not even the Washington Post. It's been out. - Jesus. - The rightful owner has sent someone down here to recover their old communicator or whatever the hell it is. - Yup. - [Lee] You wouldn't have don't it, would you? - [Kirby] What? - Kill Wood if he didn't tell you what you needed to know. You couldn't kill one of your own men. - Wood's not one of my men. - You can't carry this burden around with you forever, Sergeant. It'll destroy you. - What's a boot camp without him? He's a good man. [melancholic music] Took his dog tag so I wouldn't forget. I got him killed. - It's not your fault. Neither of is any of these. - Yeah? But I couldn't stop it. There's difference between good guys and bad guys. - There is, Kirby. You still believe that, don't you? - Maybe, but it doesn't seem to matter. You can do your job, still lose in the end. 'Cause of people like Wood in there. - Then we don't let him win. Maybe you're right. I'm gonna walk the perimeter. - Careful, Sergeant. - Knowledge hawks, that's what you are. But it gets out, it gets out. Area 51, huh? Roswell. - Look, I hate to break this to you but Roswell is nothing but a spy buoy. And there's nothing at Area 51 but some old atomic powered aircraft prototypes from the '50s that never got off the ground. And in case you're wondering, Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. I see you like bony conspiracy theories floating around. They hide the real ones. Any other questions? - Yeah, well. What about John Lennon? - You got me there. - That was a tragedy. - [Adams] Dr. Lee, where's the sergeant? - [Lee] Going to walk the perimeter. - Oh, that's good. You see, I wanted to talk to you about something. I need your help. - Dr. Adams, I'm afraid I'm a bit tired. [tense music] - I insist. Please don't scream, the result would be bad for both of us. - What are you doing? - I'm afraid I don't have time to chat right now but I'm sure you'll agree I've done much better job at concealing my thoughts than Mr. Wood. Now, let's go. You're taking me back to the underground base. - We can't get through the door. - How did you get that away from the sergeant? - I didn't, I brought it with me. Of course, I didn't know the code until you and the sergeant encouraged Mr. Wood. Now, move. [tense music] - How many Air Force officers have you assassinated for making you false reports? - None. In fact, most the really unlikely ones are ours. - All right, right, I get it. Disinformation. - That's right. You see, numbers are positive and negative and knowledge is positive and negative. We release enough negative knowledge, it cancels up the real stuff. - True. Anyhow, we'll see it. Not that I approve. - No, of course not. Never would have guessed. Vince was a CIA. Guess you just can't trust anybody these days. [tense music] - Punch it in. Punch it in, come one. Three, 27, 60. Get in. - So, we'll be up in about 20 minutes. I think we can beat this thing. We got to get to the rendezvous. Where's Adams and Lee? - I thought they were with you. - Where'd they've gone? - I have a pretty good idea. - What do you see inside my head, doctor? - Blank, like a wall. - Hypnotic conditioning. The CIA is nothing, it's not thorough. - Christ, you're telling this is some kind of inter-agency competition? - Wood has been in-charge here long enough. When you give a man too much power, he becomes overconfident then paranoid. The CIA can't trust a feeble-minded guy like him with something this momentous. I'm the new operative. - So, what do you want with me? - I brought you along as an early warning system. You will let me know if the rider is anywhere close. - I would rather die if you I could take you with me. - Let's hope that you don't have the chance to test that theory. Now, come on, let's go. My ride will be here in about three hours. [tense music] - Wood, you're taking us to Adams and Lee. - Wrong again, children. - Fire once and you're dead. - Come on, I'm already dead. Don't you get it? I'm finished. Agency's just gonna rub me out for letting this leak. I'm already been replaced by another operative, Adams. You spend half your life searching for the truth and the other half telling lies. Pretty soon you don't know what the difference is but it's too late. You don't know how to stop. Well, this is where I stop. So you better get out. You just get the hell out! [motor revving] - [Kirby] Let's go! - Bring it on, you son of a bitch! [explosion bangs] - He made his choice. At least it bought us some more time. Come on! [motor revving] - Sounds like we're almost ready to go. And remember, don't touch it until I give you the okay. - What if I don't wanna do it? - You have no choice if you wanna get out of here alive. Now, shut up and stand by. Open the hatch. This is it. Now! Do it now! Give it to me. Give it to me. I'll take it now. [grunting] [motor revving] [screeching] [suspenseful music] [screeching] [gunshot bangs] [suspenseful music] [gunshots bang] [yelling] [gunshots bang] [screeching] - Dr. Lee, are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. - We gotta get out of here. The chopper is ready to leave. - No, wait, Kirby. I know how to kill that thing. [suspenseful music] Kirby, buy me some time, wait for my cue! - [Biker] Do not attack, I want to communicate with you. - Who the hell are you? - [Biker] Integration of the host's brain requires some time. Mission's not been accomplished and I am able to communicate with you. Why do you attack? - You invaded us! You killed my men, you killed my squad. - [Biker] You have stolen a device from us. We refuse you to acquire forbidden information. I have been sent to retrieve this device and destroy those possessing knowledge it. I do what is necessary to accomplish my mission. I am a soldier. - So am I! - [Biker] Do you comprehend that an on-conflict between us constitutes war between our planets? - I understand but I got my orders. - [Biker] Single combat with you would serve no purpose. Your weapons cannot destroy me. I cannot be other than what I am. I will destroy you. - Good luck. - [Biker] Then you must die. - Hey! Looking for this? - Lee! [suspenseful music] - [Biker] Give me the device. The core, I must have it! - You want it? Come and get it! [motor revving] Now, Kirby, shoot, shoot! [gunshot bangs] [explosion bangs] [tense music] - Are you okay? That's a ballsy move, Dr. Lee. - Did we get him? - Yeah, we got him. But how'd you know? - I didn't, not until I touched the core. Then I made a connection with it. - You mean that thing was alive? - Yeah, and send it in an SOS. Our man on the bike would come in to the rescue. They were two minds but one and the same. - Destroy one, destroy the other. Congratulations, Dr. Lee. - You can congratulate me all you want once we're back. [motor revving] I thought you got it? - Hey, you guys saw fireworks? - You gotta be kidding me, Ditko! What the hell is this? You're about to scare us to death. - This is the world famous star cruiser. Need a lift? You're gonna miss your ride. - I'm thinking maybe it'd be better if no once showed up at the rendezvous. Let them call in the air strike. - Let them think we've all been destroyed. - Why not? I've been thinking a mid-life career change. Which way you headed Mr. Ditko? - I kinda have my heart set on anywhere but here in USA. This place definitely lost its appeal. - Sounds fine to me. How about you, Kirby? - Thought you'd never ask. - Fine, retros! Let's rock and roll, baby. [squelching] [zapping] [tense music] [tense music]
