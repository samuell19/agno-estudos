So he finds the killer and draws his sword. And the killer spits in his face. The samurai turns and walks away. Why? Because he would have killed a man in anger. It would have become a personalact, instead of the duty that he was sent to perform. [dance music] Oh!

What do you want? I wanted to meet you. I'm a big fan of your work. You got a warrant? I can get one if you want to be formal. On what charge? Oh, I don't know-- affiliationwith known criminals, conspiracy to commit murder. Thanks to the fuzziness of the RICO statutes, I can take you in for just aboutanything-- real or imagined. Then why don't you? [groans] Look, I don't think you've done anything wrong per se. What interests me most is what you may know, not what you've done. It seems that first attacktouched off a little pissing contest between Soames and the Yakuza for control of the tour bus trade. Tour buses? You know, does big diesel-farting, blue-haired charter busesyou get stuck behind while driving up to Hearst Castle. Henry Soames owns the biggesttour bus company in California, and the Yakuza want a piece of it. Damn, it's cold in here. Anyway, you just seem a lotcloser to getting your finger on the trigger man than we are. And I'd like to know just how close. I can't help you. I don't know a thing. Oh, yeah? So what the hell is this? It's a tattoo, we know that. It's Yakuza, we know that too. Unfortunately, I can't strip search the entire population of Little Tokyo, like you apparently have. Look, why don't you just arrest me or get the fuck out of my room. You saw who had this tattoo, Ms. Hayes. And if you don't cooperate, I can make things very unpleasant for you. Think about it.

One thing you should know about me is I'm not big on entertaining strangers in my room. My name's Gina. Seiji. [spark] It's the carpet. Well, nice to meet you, Seiji. Now, when I come backout, if you're still here, I call the police. [door slams] [thump] Give me that. It's mine. It's just a bunch of stupid old photographs. [melancholy piano music] That was a beach we used to love to go to. That's Halloween last year. You still have not cried yet. You can't, because you stillmust be strong for your son. When you find justice, you will cry. How do you know? I know. Hey. I know you're one of them. I want you to know that I'm going to find the guy with the tattoo-- your friend. He's not my friend. Don't bullshit me. What about the other night? He's my brother.
