[thunder claps] [police radio chatter] Breaking news! Our CM is no more. AP Chief Minister, Sri Achutha Ramayya took his last breath last night. The people of the state took it to their hearts. Taking about his administration and his character... People are stating that he's the one who gave birth to the state politics... They even said that he can never die, but will live forever in their hearts. To fill the shoes of Sri Achutha Ramayya... High command is considering some of their senior leaders. But with the neck to neck competition from the young ones... The state administration is now in a dilemma. Within no time, we'll be hearing the announcement of our new CM. The entire state is hoping for a leader who can change their fates. -Hail! -Hail Achutha Ramayya! [people hailing Achutha Ramayya] Dad did a lot for us all. As a father, he gave me a better life than I asked for. Even the position of a CM, that you all made me take... It belongs to my father! For such a great man... I wanted to respect him in a way that no son has ever respected his father in. We should feel proud to take our leader's name. His prestige should touch the tip of Himalayas! My father's name... It should live in our history forever. But the opposition seems to have plans to stop us. They already started bad publicity about the things dad did when he's in power. It's not what the enemies scream... History is something the rulers write. No corruption that happened in dad's rule should see light. Not about the people he beheaded... But talk about the good he did. We only remember Shah Jahan when we hear 'Taj Mahal'. Not the hands he slashed off. Dad's name should remain in history forever. To fight back the negative publicity of the enemies... We need a Taj Mahal! I promise that I will even risk my life to achieve that. [people hailing Achutha Ramayya] Hail Achutha Ramayya! JOHAR! (HAIL!) [religious chants] Give me your hand. Chinni? Chinni... Come here. Pray to your father. What happened to father? The water took him away. Chinni... -Chinni. -I'll take leave then. -Mom is alone at home. -At least have something food... Mom will be waiting for me. You never listen to me. At least drink some water. It's ok. I'll go home and drink. Hey, Raju. Raju... Don't take me wrong. Why stay here, drinking this dirty water? Come to our village. It's not that easy. Even my villagers look down on me as my husband is dead. -Imagine if I come there. -As you wish. -Raju? -Yes. -Drop her at the school. -Ok. -Chinni, come here. -Coming. Brother will drop you at the school, OK? Give me the bag. Hey... Wait! Dear... -Drink only from this. Ok? -Ok. Will take leave. What are you thinking about, Chinni? Mom said that the water took dad away. But at my school, they said that water will give us life. About that? The one that gives life can also take one. Leave about all that and study well. Ok? ♪ Where have you been all this time? Don't you care about our business? What are you doing? What's the kick in having our tea whenever they want? The customer will enjoy it when he has to wait for it. -Just 5 minutes. -I have been waiting all day. Please, give us some more time. It's been one hour and there's no tea yet. -Please wait! -I don't want your tea. Just two more minutes. It's almost done. It's 5 already? Murali, it's time. Fill the tea into this can. What? Did your love bell ring? Shut up and work. Or else I'll ring your bald head. Did I get late? She might have left! [humming a love song] Go go go. Today I'll talk to her somehow. Siddu, give me a cup of tea. And take my service for one hour. Did I get late? God! Is she here? She went off. Hi! Will go talk to her. -Give me a cup of tea. -Hi, sister. How are you? -All good? -Yeah. Here. -I'll take leave. -Ok. -Tea... -Bye, mom. Stop! -Go inside and offer him tea. -I am getting late for school. I am not asking you to sleep with him. Just go give him the tea. -Hello? -Tell me. -Are you free tonight? -No no. Another customer is coming. Please! I'll pay you more. ♪ Come fast, grandpa. [Hindi]: Give me blood! [Hindi]: I will give you freedom. Give me blood! I will give you freedom. He made the blood of the youth boil with patriotism... Subhash Chandra Bose! A young boy, who got influenced by his words... He wanted to meet Bose and give his blood for freedom. 1938... 2nd World War! For our freedom... Bose shook hands with the enemy of the British, Hitler! But for the boy's father, who believed in Gandhi's ways... It's traitor-ship... But for the kid who believed in Bose and the strength he gave him... That's bravery! So he opposed his own father, and he finally managed to meet Bose. Azad Hind Fauj! (Indian National Army) That boy stood in the very first row. Do you know who he is? It's me. Get in. The rain doesn't seem to be stopping soon. And the electricity will be gone for long. Let's go inside and sleep? [all]: OK, grandpa. -Careful! -OK. Keep your books there. -You have the mats there? -No. Oh, here they are. Hey, Ramu... -Did you take a leak again? -No. Grandpa, he took a leak again. What happened? -What happened? -It's not me, grandpa. Make it fast! [commotion] You said we'll get freedom with blood, right? What should we give to get new tiles? Hey! Where did you come up with all these coins! Here. Hey, get up! Wake up! Why are you disturbing me early in the morning? Did you bring it? Yeah. Let's go first. Fool! First I have to drink and only then I can work. -Give it to me. -Wait! Give! -Come on, it's getting late. -Come. -Move! Hello... -Come. -Move! -You move, old man! [indistinct chatter] -Come on girls. -[all]: Sir! OK, kids... It's time for the race. This outer circle lap distance is 400 meters. Inner circle 200 meters. -Which one will you run? -[all]: 200 meters! Ok, take your positions. On your marks. Get set. Who are you? Hey, stop! Do you know how many meters you just ran? That too without shoes! Where do your parents stay? Come to the ground tomorrow morning. With running shoes... Hey, why did you take this road? -We have to head that way. -Hanuman Festival is going on, sir. That road was blocked. There are people everywhere around that statue, sir. God, I'll never understand these brainless people. Praying for Hanuman at home will do, right? Why should they create all this mess? The one thing that keeps humans going is not just fear of God, sir... It's the bravery he lends us! Not many can understand that God is someone bigger than us... But a statue will prove that point. The minute they lay their eyes on such a huge statue of God... It will remind them of his greatness... And also fill them with strength. And that strength keeps them going, sir. That's why millions of people visit that statue every year. Do we need this statue now? Not just a 'need'... It's a 'must'! For my father's name to be written in rock... This has to be done at any cost. But this is too big a decision to take at this point. Why don't we introduce some special packages under his name? Like groceries for just 10 rupees. Paying all their hospital bills at times... Because packages like these will never go out of style. Next government will get them down to 5 rupees and name them after their leaders. What can we do then? Let's name a railway station or an airport after your father. You have been here even before I was born. You should have known how many times our Hyderabad airport changed names. I am telling you as I am here even before you are born... If we can manage to spend 10% of that amount during the campaigning... We will win the elections with the highest majority. Liquor and money will buy a single vote during a single election. But the image that their leader is a God... It will work in every other election. That is why I have decided to make my dad a God! What if you do? If my dad is a God... What will his son be? Got it... But will they believe him as a God, with just a statue? Not just any statue, uncle. A statue that makes even the Gods jealous. The public are just fools, uncle. One who praises them are great humans! And who's no more are stars and Gods! Why do we have a Hanuman statue at the border of every village? To fill the village with bravery. This statue will do the same for our party. Even the opposition members will look at him, standing tall! The next generations of students will read this in their textbooks. That is why... I have decided to build my dad a statue, that no history had ever seen. Keep a proposal for funds with the high command. Are you going to teach them at least today? As if there is a deadline for that! Enough! Tell me... What you all aspire to be? I'll be a SI (Sub-inspector). I'll be a movie star. Next... I'll be a scientist. I'll stop the water from taking any more lives. I'll find a way to cleanse the water that took my father away. Very good! From tomorrow onwards, come to class on time. I'll teach you Science. [all]: OK, sir. That's all for today. You can go play now. Go. Hey, Chinni fell unconscious. -Nurse... -Sir... -Take the girl away. -OK, sir. Slowly! Sir... My girl... What's there to ask? It's obvious! What's obvious, sir? Your husband had it... The entire village has it... The great Uddanam kidney problem! Sir, what should I do now? I feel pity for your innocence. What we do for all those who get affected... Dialysis. It means, pumping out her blood, cleaning it and injecting it back. You filled your blood with this poisonous water, right? It has to be cleaned. Hey, why did you take my father away? Who will take me to school now? Who will buy me my favourite biscuits? Who will take my mom to the hospital? As if everything on this beach is yours... How can you take away all of it? I won't let you take anyone else! I'll thrash you... Terrestrial organisms take-up oxygen from the atmosphere... Whereas aquatic animals... Stop staring like that! Hit puberty fast and give me some rest. My body can't take this anymore. Come on... What... Is this your first time? [continues to read] Take off your clothes... Make it fast. Yeah. Faster! People think you are so beautiful and even write poetry on you... I am sure they have never seen Jyothi. If they did, they will never come back to you. I don't like people gawking at me all the time. I don't know when my mom will understand my pain! She thinks I have to be working, just like her. I don't want this life. I want to live in a new and a beautiful world. But whom should I ask? Tell her to ask me, just for once... At least ask her to look at me. I'll lay my entire life at her feet. I want to run as far as possible from this world. Let her ask me... And I'll take her to the edges of this universe. What if my mom never gets to know, even when I really hit puberty? Such a great idea! Me... And my Jyothi next to me. Forever... Just we both...

You have a need. The one who works for it will also have needs. Only when you can meet his needs, your needs will be met. No no, mine is not a need, sir. It's about the lives of 100 kids. I have been trying for 7 years. You are not releasing the funds sanctioned for hostel restoration. The rainwater is dripping in. The kids are not being able to sleep well. It seems that you haven't understood what I said. It's our need to do all this on the name of our leader. But you named your hostel 'Bose'. Sir, tell me clearly, what do you want to convey? Simple! Name your hostel after our leader and the funds will follow. It's not as easy as changing the name... To change oneself! Remember that. Grandpa! Sit down, master... Drink some water, uncle. Maybe I shouldn't say so, but do you need all this? Listen... The kids are unable to sleep at night... Without proper sleep and proper food... How can they concentrate at school? That's why... -I have decided to... Damn! -Your student is here... -Rajesh... Come on! -Grandpa... -Sit down. -What happened? Why do you look hurt?

With 50 bucks, I have to buy liquor for my old man every day. The remaining 100 bucks are not even enough for... ...my food and to bribe the police. How can I afford a new pair of shoes, sir?

What's with your sloppy practice? You need the stamina to succeed in running. Stamina so high, that you can run the whole day... Can you? -I am already doing the same, sir. -What? What 'what'? To put up a circus in the morning and run during the evenings... Imagine how difficult it will be. Didn't you stop playing circus on the roads? Who will feed me if I stop doing that, sir? Academy selections are about to start soon. I'll prepare you to face it. You are my responsibility now. Will you do as I tell you to? -Yes, sir. -Good! The Buddha statue in China is 153 meters. Statue of Liberty is 93 meters. If we can beat the Buddha statue by 50 meters... This will be the tallest statue in the world. Among all the tallest statues in the world, 5 are of Buddha. No wonder, Buddhism is the most influential religion in the world. Now is the time to make your father a God in the eyes of the public. Look at this book... How heavy it is! Not just heavy...

Why didn't you come to work today, Gangamma? I went to the city to run some errands. What happened? Is your daughter not feeling well? No. The same illness our water gives everyone here.

The central committee rejected our proposal for funds to build the statue. They all respect your father. But they say that they can't allot such a huge amount for his sake. I have read this somewhere, uncle... 'But' is always preceded by a lie. Truth only comes after that 'But'. Their respect for my father is a lie. Not being able to allot the funds is true. We made you the CM instead of Deputy, against their wishes. This is the ripple effect of that. They are laughing at us, instead of realizing how proud the country will be. Let us answer back all those who laugh at us, uncle. The same faces that are laughing today should fall, witnessing the grandeur. It feels good to think so. But... But what? It's a fact that we don't have such a huge amount. My dad used to tell me this, uncle... A true leader is not the one who stops with a 'No'. One who creates his own way out, by hook or by crook...

OK? -OK, sir. -Here you go. -Thank you so much, sir. -Girl, study well. Bye. See... Grandpa paid us. Shall we go get some medicine for you? The preliminary estimation is 30 million, sir. What? 30 million! Our state already has 30k crores of debt. It's impossible to get such amount of money right now. We have recently released our budget, right? That's money too. Even that budget was based on more debts. We can't make ourselves a golden crown out of debt money, right? If we make cuts on daily supplies, the state will burn. I think you are not following me at all. We are not making any cuts there. Let's say our agenda is to feed a hungry man until he's full. What if we don't feed him at all? He'll scream at the government, unable to take hunger. But if we feed him half the amount, he'll adjust with what he gets. He'll never fight back. The theory sounds good. But how can we implement this? Let's say I know my father has 100 bucks in his pocket. If I take it directly... I'll get caught. So my plan is that... I'll take 20 bucks from dad. 20 more from mom. 20 from the worship room and 20 from my grandpa. I'll get to the mark of my 100, taking amounts of 20 from many places. Even they won't question me back, as it's just 20 bucks out of 100. So what shall we do now? We are not cutting off the entire funds. We are just making little cuts. Just - little - cuts! They'll question us if we don't help them at all. Not when we do give some. The middle class will never think out of the box. Now you sound like your father's son. Good!

Why did you cheat me in the name of making everything right! They say scolding you make men burn in hell. Is there even a hell that's more burning than this? My mom told me that you'll make us feel hunger... And then you'll finally feed us one day. I believed in her like a fool. I thought you made me feel hungry and is about to feed us right. But... But... I just realized that you fed me poison! I thought you are testing me. But this is just plain damnation. I failed to see this coming. God! How can I save my daughter now? -What's your name? -Gangamma, sir. -Is this your field? -Yes, sir. -How many acres of land is this? -Two acres, sir. -How much do you think you have lost? -Around 1 lakh, sir. -Will the government helps us with it, sir? -Yeah, of course... Meet us in the office after ten days. OK, sir. Ready. Uncle... -Hey, boy... How are you? -I'm good. -Nice! When did you come here? -Been a week, uncle. -Sir, meet my uncle. -Oh! I tried to call you many times, but couldn't reach. You have no idea how busy I am. Even God needs to take an appointment. Come, let's go to the river bank and have a smoke. -Uncle, I'll just come. -OK. -What else... -I came here thinking I would meet you. Sir... -What? -Hall-ticket. You don't know yet? Scholarships this year has been canceled. Everyone is paying their fee for the hall-ticket. I can't pay that kind of amount, sir. Please help me out, sir. How can you even think of all this without having enough money. -What's your name? -Jyothi, sir. -Which year? -First-year, biology. What are you planning on doing now? You can't attend the exam without paying the fee. I know, sir. Please help me out, sir! I can't pay that kind of money right now, sir. Do as I say. Say that there's a private class this evening. -Shall I inform the class, sir? -Not for the entire class. It's especially for you. Think about it... By the time you come to my room this evening, ...the hall-ticket will be on my table. -So that's how you got here... -Yes, uncle. -Where is the girl staying now? -She's staying with me. With you? God! -What's that, uncle? -This? You are too young for this. He helped me set up the shop, uncle. -He helped me apply for a loan too. -Got him, sir. Once I get the loan, I can support Jyothi's education... -Got you... Finally! -Uncle... -Catch him! -Sir, what did I do? [commotion] Don't think less of me. Tell him not to act smart! I'll thrash him... Hold on! -Can I help you? -Where is Siddu? Siddu's uncle is here and they went to the river bank together. -Do you want me to give him a message? -No. OK... Tell me. Jyothi, one second. Siddu got a letter. Hey, come let's go thrash him. -Sir, please sir. -Hey... What about you? I'm innocent, sir. They didn't even let me explain myself, sir. Are you selling drugs? Sir, I have no idea how they even look like. Sir, please don't hit me. Sir, please sir. Sir, please sir! Uncle, tell him, uncle. -Uncle? Is he your uncle? -Sir... Just for namesake, sir. Sir, please sir. Sir... Stay put for two more days. I'll buy some medicine and save you. Even you are not feeling well, right mom? It's been two months since the last time you took any medicine. I'll take medicine, only after you do. ♪ Gangamma... The government has sent us a relief fund. Let's go collect it. Come fast! I'll go get the money and we can visit the doctor. OK? Be careful until I come back. Give him the money. Take it... Next! -What's your name? -Yellamma, sir. Thumb impression, here... Here you go. -Here is your 20k. -Sir, it's 1 lakh. We can't give anything more than this. Our budget won't allow us to. -Sir, please... -Leave! -Sir, my daughter is not feeling well... -Move aside... Next! What's your name? Subbayamma, sir. Stay put for two more days. I'll buy some medicine and save you. Such a loss this cyclone has caused! -Oh... Thank, God! -Sir... the money! I have to admit my daughter in the hospital with that money, sir. The cyclone affected my business too. How can I feed my kids, if I start caring for your daughter. -Sir, please! I need that money... -Will see you later. Sir, do you know why I started to run? Even my mom used to play circus on the roads. We are so poor that we never even had a full meal. We used to manage to get food for only one member of the family. My mom used to feed her part of the ration to me. One day... We failed to make even that amount of food. Even that God failed to provide us. My mom suffered from hiccups all night. And she died of it! My mom used to tell me this, sir... Never think of being the underdog all the time... Always dream big, earn big and live big... Prove yourself! I... I only know two things in life, sir. One, playing circus. Two, running. Right now, you are not even fit, Bala. Do you believe that you can win? Even if the God himself tries to race with me... I will beat him too, sir. That's how much I believe in myself, sir. [people clapping] ♪ Hey 402... Let that boy go. That's me... Jyothi... I knew you would come... I have been waiting for you. Along with your hall-ticket. No need, sir. I have come all this way, just to avoid this life. I thought only education can help me out of it. But even if my educations asks for the same old life... Listen... This is just a basic need like food and sleep. Girls like you make a big deal out of it. I have no idea if you knew this... Not just education... This is the only way to get things done anywhere in this world. Then I don't need this education. OK... So you have decided. No... Don't take too much tension... Take it easy! This is very common. Let me help you... Hey... Siddu, listen to me. Siddu, look at me. Siddu... Listen to me... Siddu! Siddu, what you saw is not what's happening. He asked me to pay the fee for the hall-ticket. At this hour? Are you here to pay or get paid? Siddu... Please! I have gone just a day and you already opted for someone else. Why? Can't you wait until I'm back? Where did I go... What would have happened to me... Did you at least think of it? I thought you are an angel. I'm a mad fool! How can an angel be born in a prostitute's house? There's no difference between you and your mom. Siddu! Can't you just stop and listen to me? I have been searching for you all day. I have no idea where you are... I have an exam tomorrow. They won't let me attend without paying the fee. I have no one to speak with. Even you went missing. And the loan for your own shop got rejected. Yes, I have gone to meet the principal... But only to teach him a lesson! I have been searching for you like a fool! Of course, I AM a fool. I thought you loved me. -Now I know what you think of me. -Hey... Hey! -Move away. -Siddu... I can't even look at you. Get lost! Go back to him... ♪ Siddu... -Are you with the patient? -Yes, sir. He's in a critical condition. Don't worry. We'll try our best. Hello! One... One of my friends committed suicide. He has his life insured with your company. Can you help his family? Sorry, sir. We can't consider suicide for the claim. The claim will pass only if he had died in an accident. What's your friend's name? For what we strongly believed in... It's not a mistake to fight for it, even with our life. Doctor... How's Siddu doing? He can't get back to normal again. His brain is not responding to any stimulations. He has to be in a coma until his last breath. -Nurse, do the needful. -OK, sir. Siddu... Get up... Can you listen to me? They say that you can never see me again. You can't talk to me either. Seeing you like this... Not being able to talk to you... I can't be like this. I just can't! Hav... Have some water. Have some more. -Mom, it's painful! -Help! -Mom, it's paining so much. -Please try to bear it! -Mom, I can't take it anymore. -Wait... Wait, I'll go get help. -Mom... -Help! -Mom! -Help... -Gowri, can you lend me some money? -Sorry... My husband took it all. Ganga... -Listen, can you lend me some money? -Sorry, Ganga! -Why did she ask? -May be for her daughter. Lakshmi, can you please lend me some money. Chinni is not feeling well. -I have to take her to the hospital. -I have no money, sister. ♪ Really painful stories... Very sad! Can I ask you why did you tell me these stories? Who else should I tell them to? It's you who killed each one of them, sir. Have you gone mad? As if the CM is accountable to every single death in the state. You might not be the reason for their deaths, sir. But I'm saying that you are the one who's... ...accountable to each and ever life in this state. I don't want to learn that from you. It's time to inaugurate the statue... I have to leave. The same statue... for which you have made cuts in the budget, right? These lives are just mere examples of the repercussions it created. This is just the tip of the iceberg. There are thousands and millions of such lives lost, sir. Yet another allegation! How can you prove that there has been cuts in the budget? These lost lives are proof! Their graves are the answers! Mmm, yeah. I have made cuts in the budget, just for that statue. A state needs its reputation, along with the will to handle its problems. Not just poverty can bring in foreign investments. We have to put out our culture and reputation too. One can see the statue even from a satellite. And thus they can see our pride. As if they can only see the statue from a satellite, sir... Can't they see our poverty from up there? Leave about them... Can't YOU see them, sir? Our needs should come before our pride. We have poverty, illness... ...unemployment, and utter darkness in the villages. Look at the roads, sir! There are no proper toilets installed for our women to lead a respectable life. A small rain can overflow our drainage system. The farmers who feed us... Keep committing suicides Swachh Bharat doesn't mean posing for photos... ...as if getting the roads and drainages cleaned, sir. We have to clean poverty out of our country first. I have been tolerating you just because you are a journalist. Mind your tongue! You have all the power to control my language, sir. But you can't control the public... They have been cursing you, sir! Not just our people... Those British people who ran back to their country... Even they are blaming us, sir. They say that India take loans for basic food grains... But end up building shameless statues. The opposition is creating all this. Opposition? Even they belong to your kind, right sir? There is a huge surge in the rates. A polio vaccine that cost 40 bucks once, now comes for 140 bucks. You even stopped distributing it, because of budget cuts. About 40 million children are dying of malnutrition. Aren't they the future of our nation, Mr. Chief Minister? For our country to really be proud of itself... Instead of spending on these statues, spend it on sportspersons like Bala. They'll win medals and bring in a lot more... ...pride to this country from the entire world. Spend it on farmers like Gangamma. They'll keep our stomachs filled. Invest in people like Bose, who'll teach the next generations our real values. It will build stronger armed forces. Invest in students like Jyothi, who would give their everything to get educated. So all this is just my fault... Is that what you would say? That's not just what I would say... I AM saying it! You didn't build your father's statue over his goodwill. You have built it over graves of the innocent. We have no budget for polio drops or to compensate for a farmer's loss. But one state builds a statue with 30 billion... And another state build one with 40 billions. We have a budget for all this! What's this, sir? What's happening? Those lives that have been crushed under the foundations of these statues... How in hell can you get them back, sir? [phone rings] Hello! Yeah, I'm on my way. [people hailing Vijay Varma] Sir, you have built the statue, even after the center rejecting the funds to it. Will you take care of the people with the same interest? Sir, is this a political stunt? Sir, how do you feel, inaugurating your father's statue? Sir, people think that you have looted them for this cause. How do you react to that? Will the government helps us with it, sir? You are the reason! You failed to provide me proper diet. These governing bodies... I have no belief in them. Not at all. Don't take any tension about my education. My scholarship money will get it covered. You didn't build your father's statue over his goodwill. You have built it over graves of the innocent. ♪ The coming generations... The future... The foundations laid on the dead bodies of their dreams... ...are these statues. All those people who elect such leaders and still put up with them... We hail them all!
