[chair scraping] [sighs] - All righty, then. As you guys know, Elder has asked me and Vic to step in as cochairs of the Battle of Main Streets contest. - And we know each year, one of your stores is highlighted as part of the Winter Wonderland theme. - It's my turn this year. - Is it? Um, well, Vic and I were thinking that maybe-- - Were you? About how to play up my pottery shop? [snorts] You might have consulted me before you started thinking. - Uh, I think what Amelia was trying to say is that maybe this year, we shake things up. Huh? - Whoa, whoa, whoa. I have waited five years for my turn in the contest spotlight, so if your "big idea" involves anything other than that, I suggest you return to the drawing board. - Seriously, Rowena? Why don't you just let them speak? - I'm letting them speak. - It's not always about you. - You need to stop this right now. - I'm perfectly calm. - This is ridiculous. - Okay, guys. - What are you talking about? Why is everyone ganging up on me? - Guys? Guys! - What are you talking about? - This is ridiculous. - Hey, um, can we just cool down? Just--let's be calm. - Cool down? Cool down? I'm very cool. I'm very calm, Miss Contest Helper Person. You be cool and calm. - Truly? - I'm not--I did not-- but why is everyone standing up-- - Amelia? Hey. - We're settling our disagreements among ourselves. - Look what you just did. - I didn't do that. - You just insulted them. - I didn't do that. She's gonna be such a baby, she's gonna leave before-- - They're volunteering. - Well, there's no-- - Hey, Amelia. So when the going gets tough, the tough walk out? - I'm not quitting, just for the night. I'm gonna let them chill out, and we can try again tomorrow. - First sign of trouble, and you just head for the hills? Nice. - That's not fair. We're not gonna accomplish anything tonight with them fighting like that. - You know what's not fair is that you made a promise to Elder for your own selfish reasons.

We got in a bit of an argument a while back about a young man she was seeing. Turned out, I was right, but she remained angry that I interfered in her personal life. - But you said you were right. - Well, I was, I was, but a big old "I told you so" from a meddling father doesn't help matters much. - Well, I'm so sorry. - Well, she did come to her mother's funeral, and we had a civil conversation. I was kinda hoping we could put our past behind us, but, uh, I haven't heard from her since. But we all have our stories, don't we, our family histories?

So Vic and I have done some research on the history of this town, and it sparked an idea. - Oh, jeez. - Yes, Rowena? - My ancestors founded this town. - And that's great. It's what we want to celebrate. - Wait, what do you mean, "celebrate"? - Well, every year, you use the Winter Wonderland theme because it gives each of you an opportunity to spotlight your businesses. - Yeah, but what if this year, we could spotlight all the businesses in the same theme? - No, no, it's my turn. - Wait, hear us out. Let Castle Creek's history tell a story. Each of your businesses represents a chapter. Then we walk the judges through the chapters, celebrating Main Street's past. - That sounds like a great idea. - I like--yeah, I like that. - I mean, Winter Wonderland hasn't exactly been working for us. - So we're just gonna pretend that this keeps with our tradition, Billy? - Maybe this year, we buck tradition. - Now, we know that you were really looking forward to your shop being the focus of the competition, and we think that there's a way we can do that. Your shop will be the first and the last chapters. The story will end where it began. - As a descendant from the founding family of Castle Creek, we think it's only right, not to mention we want you to escort the judges. - So the cameras would begin and end at my shop?
