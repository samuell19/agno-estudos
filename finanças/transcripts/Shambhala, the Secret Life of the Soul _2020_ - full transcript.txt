Shambhala, resplendent and hidden, invisible to predators shining through the eyes of mystics, a kingdom coveted by conquerors and dictators. Legends tell the story of immense treasures, of a land ruled by immortal kings with unlimited power. Echoes of stories dot the narrations of fugitives and merchants explorers and travelers of all manner along the Silk Road. Shambhala the Himalayan summits where supreme wisdom and universal love have created pureness and harmony. It is believed by some to be the source of all life on our planet. Fear? No, I was never afraid to come here o into any other cave. I remember playing here with my friends and other children. There were no steps so getting up here was a lot of fun. Some say this hole is the opening to a secret tunnel leading far away. Someone blocked the entrance with this boulder. I don’t think anyone entered. I don’t know if Tibet is Shambhala Many scholars say that Ladakh may have some characteristics of Shambhala Many people believe there is in Ladakh a cave with a door to the kingdom of Shambhala. These facts, or perhaps legends offer no tangible proof. The great teachers don’t say What Shambhala is or even where it is. Personally, having done some research I consider it beyond the reach of humans. I have been to Tibet, in Tibet sometimes there are rocks with signs and people say... this is a door to Shambhala, but also here in Ladak they sometimes say Choglamsa the North gate, or the access to Shambhala, rumors of this like, but they are legends. Leh, Ladakh - India We knew nothing about Shambhala. We hadn’t read anything about it but felt strongly attracted to Ladakh. Something significant marked the beginning of this story. We were at a friend’s on a barge in Paris. He introduced us to a lama he knew well. This lama said he would give us a reference letter. This was strange because we hadn’t told him anything. So we left with a small piece of Thinn paper bearing the lama’s seal. We imagined it might be important but we didn’t know the lama sufficiently well to understand just how important and we didn’t know what had been written. We left for Ladakh. At first, we traveled from one monastery to the next without knowing where we would use this reference letter. Some monks turned the piece of papera round without being able to read it. They didn’t understand it, and gave it back to us. We knew we were not in the right place. Shambhala? Isn’t it a lama? What is it? I don’t know At the village of Pokar the lama told us it was a sacred place. This so-called Shambhala everybody is seeking. What can it be? Shargola: a purification rite This village is considered to be the Eastern Gate. This place was called Tingdho where the three valley meet. It is the entrance to the three valleys, hence the name Shambhala is the north. When the future Buddha of the Shambhala kingdom comes there will be amazing changes. Before his descent, he will bring complete destruction to the world. It is written in the scriptures that the force of the four elements will cause the total destruction of all living and non-living beings. The teachers say the Buddha of the Shambhala kingdom will be the last. If this place is the gate to Shambhala, there must be a door, an entrance. But I can’t find it. A characteristic of this area as written in history books, is that “an earth and sky triangle” is to contain the energy. This is true, because Saint Autrumpa was here and reported it. Only divine beings live at Shambhala. We can define these being as gods. Even on the earthly level there are “dri-sa”, the “scent-eaters”. They are entities we do not perceive, like the spirits of the water and wind. Similarly, in Shambhala, there are powerful beings, particular entities such as the goddess of eternal life dominated by Brahma and Vishnu and the powerful kings of the Deva. We can’t say for sure who lives there. I think it may be like on earth: there are many different types of sentient beings. At last, we arrived at the Hemis monastery. As soon as they saw the paper, our reference letter they greeted us and told us to wait. They would take care of us. The medicine lama came to us. Although we didn’t speak his tongue and he didn’t speak English he managed to show us some documents which indicated the passage of Jesus through that monastery. This was important us because of what we had experienced in a former life 2000 years earlier and reported in the book: “The Other Face of Jesus”. Jesus made a trip to Ladakh during his co-called “lost years”. Next the lama showed us where to sleep. There were two mats on the floor behind a curtain. That night it all happened. I left my body in the small cell of the Hemis monastery together with our guide Master Djwal Kool who had also disembodied. In an astral voyage we crossed green valleys surrounded by snow-capped mountains. I was absorbed by a spiral of light that led us to other locations among snowfields and high summits. In these valley I saw geometric shapes and buildings. There were Aztec-like shapes Others in Hellenic style But they were sublimated shapes. One could say sacred architecture. With the lama we went into one builing with cupolas and colonnades. We found ourselves in a large hall with three doors. We went through the middle one. Each door intriqued me. There were signs all around them in a script unknown to me. I couldn’t read them, but I had the distinct feeling they referred to humanity’s past and present. It is known that there is a text that shows the way to Shambhala which we Tibetans call ‘Shambala Lamyuk’. I was lucky enough to see this book kept by a family in the Zanskar there is the story of a person who has been to Shambhala. How it got there isn't said. But remember that heading north, you come across a series of large glaciers beyond the glaciers there is a lake or an ocean and to reach Shambhala you have to cross it. In the book it is clearly written that the monks of Shambhala wear the same tunic as the Indian monks of Jambudweep. Men dress in blue while women in red. The description says that there are countless huge cities and that each city is governed by a governor who wears a golden crown on his head. Then in the book there is also written that when a messenger is sent from one place to another with a letter he receives a small stick he holds it in his hand and thanks to this object he can instantly reach any place he wishes. We found ourselves in a small hall. A kind of welcoming committee was expecting us. They wore the same simple blue tunics nothing seemed to differentiate them. Only a thin rope was used to tighten their dress around their waist. We were welcomed by these beings Who put us to the test and then told us about the place we were in. This rod has a story. It was given to us by the beings at Shambhala when we first met. It was strange because they put it in our hand saying “We give you this rod as a sign of connection not of power, but as a link between you and us.” Then they waited. After a few minutes, since nothing was happening and we remained silent not knowing what to say they smiled and said: “This rod was a test. As we saw no desire for power in your eyes you may continue on your journey. Had we seen even the slightest desire for power we wouldn’t have tolerated it neither regarding your trip nor for what we have to tell you. We found this rod four years later in the concrete, physical realm, among bushes. We knew it was that same rod because at that moment we heard the voice of a being form Shambhala saying it was indeed the rod used in the test. Srinagar, Kashmir - India They were asked about the one with two horns. I will recite to you an account of him. Verily, we gave him the ways and the means to all ends. And he followed a road. He traveled to the farthermost West until he reached the setting place of the sun. He found it setting in a bubbly spring. Near it he found a people. We said: “Oh, Two-Horns, you can either punish them or treat them with kindness.” About Islamic mythology? We know Alexander by the name of Iskandar Dhu-l-Qarnain. Iskandar means with two horns or was at the same time a man but also a God. He had in his soul the desire to find the sources of life. In the holy Quran this description is made. Its history is linked to Al Khadir who is an immortal saint. When Alexander heard about Shambhala's existence, he wanted to look for her. This Al Khadir man wanted to guide him and together they started the search because the saint had already drunk from the source of immortality. They reached the mountains, then crossed underground passages and reached a wonderful place heaven on earth with the wonderful source. ...end Alexander refused to drink the water of life. It is said that in 880 Suchandra king of Kashmir, went to Shambhala and learned from the Buddha the knowledge of the practice of Kalachakra which then spread. In Kalachakra you have to concentrate on your body and locate the energy points. The inner aspect requires concentration on one's internal points to elevate them through the purity of the mind and thanks to karmic connections. This means that when practicing Kalachakra meditation it is possible that, thanks to karmic bonds, a person will guide us to the level of Shambhala. It all started in 1971 I was a student then. My first out of body experience occurred on afternoon. I was lying down, relaxing when suddenly I saw myself outside my physical body. I hadn’t taken any drugs or artificial substances. I hadn’t taken any drugs or artificial substances. And just very tired. When I saw myself outside my body my first thought was to ask is this death? I wanted to understand. I searched bookstores and faculty libraries until I found a passage in an old book that described my experience. It was an astral trip. After some time, it happened again. Gradually, I noticed that the dense material my armchair, the furniture, my room… I could traverse all these things. There’s also a funny episode. At that time there was “Jaws” a film about a man-eating shark. It hadn’t been shown in France yet. One day, I told myself that I’d like to go to a movie theatre in the States. I’d see the film, and then tell people here about it. I did just that. I described details to friends. When the film came out in France, everything fit. At that time there was no Internet. I couldn’t have known the details. As months went by I found out that by thinking about a place I cloud get there at the speed of thought or light, who knows? At one point I was traversing a tunnel of light exactly as in Near-Death Experiences accounts. I found myself at the after-life level the subtle dimension the astral plane, whatever you may call it. At that point I met the being who has guided us since then. We began to explore all subtle levels: the one before life, the one after… Everything began thanks to our encounter with that guide I salute the Guru, I invoke you, glorious and sublime teacher who has extended the lineage of the primeval Buddha in the kingdom of Shambhala. May I realize this truth in the city of Kalapa, in the North where the holy Dharma is revealed and where the Bodhisattva live immersed in Kalachakra. The magnificence of the palace surpasses hat of the god Indra Its radiant square palace, adorned with gems, is 12 ancient miles in breadth, surrounded by 900 million villages its gardens of paradise delightfulness itself. Sublime matter is heightened, to inestimable precious gem. What is Shambhala? The Panchen Lama tells us it is pure earth and resembles a lotus flower with eight petals. It stands in the middle of an icy mountain, a very special mountain. Each petal, each of the eight petals, is a separate, very large world in which many people live. Each has a spiritual power... the inhabitants do not live like us. We work, cultivate, instead they practice Kalachakra is practiced most of the time in Shambhala. I received Kalachakra initiation. According to the teaching of the Buddha, we must practice but it is not enough: without love, without compassion, without joy, without equality it is impossible to reach that level. Ultimately it is necessary to reach the spiritual elevation of the Bodhisattvas. Love allows you to change vibratory state. In my first out of body experience I was happy to Travel around the planet in the material realm at the speed of thought, beyond my physical body but still on this planet. Then I found out that by changing my interior state of consciousness by conceiving more noble thoughts and by touching all that we call love which is actually something indefinable difficult to categorize because we tend to reduce it to what it is not since it is infinite. There is a vibratory state where particles move more quickly. You vibrate at an increasing speed And this allows you to access the subtle levels. Solan, Himachal Paradesh - India Tibetan exile community, Bon Monastery Benpo: Pre-Buddhist Tibetan Religion Bon means: “invoking monk” Olmo Lungring is the birthplace of the founder of the Bon religion Tonpa Scen Rab. Yungdrung (Swastika): ancient Bon symbol for eternity. Olmo Lungring is one of many divine dimensions where one can be born through practice and prayer. One of these dimensions is Shambhala and it is identical to Olmo Lungring. Tonpa Scen Rab was born in Olmo Lungring for a precise reason: to help future believers understand the importance of a pure place where only pure beings live and where only beings gifted with spiritual qualities may go. It is a place where people hoard only virtues. A pure being is born into an environment of absolute perfection. Tonpa Scen Rab chose Olmo Lungring in order to later help others. According to tradition and Bon scriptures Master Tonpa Rab and his word are a unique reference. There are three biographies of the founder of this faith: the short, the medium and the extended. In each version it is said that Olmo Lungring is where Mount Kailash is. The mountain in the shape of the nine levels of Swastika (Yung Drung) is Kailash according to the Mdo-Dus text. Around Mount Kailash you find every reference: the lake, the mountains and the rivers. I am thus convinced that Olmo Lungring is the place where Kailash is. “The Road to Olmo Lunring” by Eisenhardt, Gobetti, Mariani Kailash, the great mountain recognizable by the nine swastikas and its 500 yojan width. The hills are large and beautiful. In the hills there is an inaccessible turquoise green lake, crystal-clear and enchanting. The other lakes are in the 4 cardinal points. The gold lake the silver lake, the steel lake and the small striped lake. Four rivers flow from the mouths of four animals: to the East, from the elephant, comes the Gange to the South, from the lion, comes the Sindhu to the West, from the horse, comes the Pakshu to the North, from the peacock, comes the Sita. When born in Olmo Lungring one can return to our world. According to the Bon tradition There are two types of men: Common ones, born on earth and another type the superior beings reincarnated in the human world and called “Na”. They are people of Olmo Lungring but they look like humans. Every time a being from Shambhala is reincarnated, he accepts the weight of dense matter and of reincarnation. There is a part of Shambhala where those called Bodhisattva live. They are beings who have vowed to remain on earth until the last inhabitant has moved on to the next level of consciousness. Master Jesus is evidently on many different vibratory planes. One part of his emanation is at Shambhala. Another reincarnated some 40 years ago in a Middle Eastern country. You must be very loving to fall back to matter again accept to err and forget your own luminous essence your belonging to Shambhala. Many beings from Shambhala when they become reincarnated on earth ask that part of their consciousness be erased in order to be able to work on earth like anyone of us, to do what they must do, whatever role they take up. This allows a whole region or country to vibrate in a different way. Anyone approaching also vibrates differently. I do not have a clear-cut plausible answer but my grand parents told me that in the past merchant caravans used this passage from Mongolia to Ladakh a leg of the silk route. I think that these merchants are the authors of the Christian writings. No-one here is able to decipher them And it has remained a mystery for us. The crosses of Tangtse may originate from the travels of Nestorian Christians in the Orient after they were banned as a result of the Council of Calcedonia in 415 A.D. In the 12th century a curious letter first reached Pope Alexander III and then Frederick Barbarossa. This letter, of which several different versions exist was signed by a Priest King, John Presbytery who called himself the “Lord of the Three Indias” He ruled over immense and rich territories where people lived in peace and harmony in a kingdom inhabited by noble subjects and wonderful creatures. One century later, in his book The Million the Venetian traveler Marco Polo (1254 – 1324) described this kingdom and its conquest by Genghis Khan some of whose court councilors were Nestorians. For several centuries the mythical Orient kingdom fell into oblivion. In terms of space, they physical Shambhala is at the level of the Gobi desert the so-called Cham desert. Explorers would love to go there, obviously. There is however a magnetic barrier to ensure that only those who are invited can reach the physical Shambhala. You could say, “let’s pack and go!” but we don’t know what can happen. In any case, one part of Shambhala is located there. Only one part, as it is at the same time on three different levels. In the first half of the 19th century travel accounts such as that of the missionary Lazarista Evariste Huc awakened Western curiosity for the lands along the Silk Road. Esotericism and occultism inspired by Oriental mysticism were blooming. In her voluminous work The Secret Doctrine the leader of the theosophical movement, Helena Petrovna Blavatsky refers to the fabulous land of Shambhala as the original source of mysticism. Refers to the fabulous land of Shambhala as the original source of mysticism. The term vril was used for the first time by the English mason and Rosicrucian Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton who was a member of the House of Lords. This prolific writer was in touch with Orient-inspired esoteric groups. In his novel, The Future Race he describes an underground world inhabited by a superior and evolved race who masters the powerful Vril energy. In 1920 the Polish writer and traveler, Ferdinand Ossendowsky published an account of his travels. This work, titled Beasts, Men and Gods recalls the stories of Mongolian Lamaist monks about this wondrous place. Shambhala is the capital of Agartha a vast continent that unfolds through a planetary network of underground galleries and where shines a special light that gives people a long life free of disease. We passed another door that led us to a kind of ridge with a tower similar ridge with a tower similar to a minaret yet a structure different from anything known to us. Its height was extraordinary. You couldn’t see the top and could only imagine it beyond a kind of fog. At the top there was a green stone that emitted a sound and light that enveloped us vivifying and energizing us. The being who accompanied us said that this stone was called “Gor Al” and that it emanated the same sound constantly for milions of years a base note that allowed the earth to remain in harmony. Without that tower and that stone Earth could lose its structure, dry out And become a lifeless planet. Dapa Tribe: Arians, inhabitants of Ancient India We come from Da Hanu. We are called Dapa. First, our forefathers venerated a stone. I don’t think it was a real religion just a belief. Gradually, Buddhist monks came to the villages teaching the rights spiritual path and many people became Buddhists. Shambhala! Shambhala I might have heard the name. Who knows where it is? I’ve heard about Shambhala but I don’t know what it is. Maybe a village nearby. There were people from Shambhala but I don’t know where that place is. It crops up in religion but we’ve never been there. In 1939, the most infamous self-proclaimed Aryan, Adolf Hitler dispatched an expedition to Tibet to study the direct descendents of the Arya a Sanskrit word meaning “the noble one” or “the one above”. Cartographic surveys and eugenic measurements were the primary official scope of this journey but, hovering in the background were the convictions of occultist Nazism held by Himmler and by the Führer himself. A truck on the convoy contained equipment for geomagnetic measurements. Its purpose is said to have been the quest for a mysterious energy, the Vril which had previously been mentioned by Blavatsky. Karl Haushofer, a political commentator versed in Oriental esotericism and a friend of Hitler’s, founded the Vril Society which later became the Thule Society whose membership included a considerable number Nazi party leaders. Recent documents revealed Nazi plans for flying saucers powered by Vril energy. Sightings of flying objects have been reported by Nicholas Roerich “… something shiny, flying very high… We bring three powerful field glasses from the tents and watch the huge spheroid body shining against the sun clearly visible against the blue sky and moving very fast. Afterwards we see that it sharply changes its direction… and disappears behind the Humboldt chain. The whole camp follows the unusual apparition and the lamas whisper: “The Sign of Shambhala!”. A decade before the Nazi expedition, the Russian painter and anthropologist Nicholas Roerich journeyed extensively in Central Asia, Tibet and Mongolia. One of his travel accounts was published with the title “Shambhala the Resplendent”. On the peaks of Sikkim a spur of the Himalayas, a lama told us... “Up there is the entrance to Shambhala. Through underground passages dug in wonderful ice caverns, some deserving people also in this lifetime have reached that blessed place where all wisdom and splendor are united.” There was a rock some 10 meters high a remarkably strong presence that resambled a fabric, a woven stone. Like a stone cathedral. Without noticing it we went inside this magical boulder which led us to a vast universe. I can use the word universe here because there were galaxies a central sun and sky. You could breathe as you do on Earth. We saw beneath us hundreds of people. Gouffre de Proumeyssac, Périgord - France In 1947 the authoritative polar explorer admiral Richard E. Byrd, wrote a few pages in his diary which were subsequently kept secret by his superiors He reported that he had seen an oasis with tropical vegetation in the ice beyond the North Pole. An advanced civilization that inhabits in hollows of the planet made contact with the high-ranking officer through flying objects and gave him a message regarding the dangers inherent in the manipulation of atomic energy and the future hardships awaiting humanity. According to esoteric schools, these were the people of Agartha the internal etherized continent of which Shambhala is believed to be a chief town. . The hollow earth has its own internal sun that coincides with an entity called “king of the world” and which is the highest level of Shambhala. Plato, the narrator of Atlantis, also mentioned (in Critias) a “hollow earth” and its network of caverns and underground passages. Hundreads of people were chanting or singing. They emitted sounds and songs unknown to us. They told us they were human beings who had left the surface of the planet 12.000 years ago at the fall of Atlantis. They were part of the sacerdotal order on Earth and they knew about those terrible cataclysm. We then were guided to doors that led to the hollow earth. They were imaginary doors not phisical ones. A change in the vibratory state made us change. Our physical appearance took on characteristics that were impossible on the surface of Earth yet we were able to preserve the knowledge of a whole era. Shambhala is not a place. Shambhala is a condition, a state. A condition where all absolutely all, sins are erased. It is the end of all injustice errors, mistakes. Everything is annihilated and erased and then, when everything is pure purity will be affirmed from the top down and there will no longer be any sin. Shambe is a higher condition. When one can attain high levels of consciousness when your own self rises you know that the whole universe is nothing but consciousness. Kali Yuga: black era, the present era of material attachment At the end of Kaliyuga God himself will descend on this planet simply to save the justice of the human being. To increase morale and give courage so that we can live on this earth in righteousness. Oh Parikshata. It will be the time of Shambhala and of the person who will be the father of Kalki, the last Avatar, and his name will be Vishnuyasha who will be born in his home. This is a volume of the Bhagavata purana it is written in Shaaradaa characters, an ancient script, but the language is Sanskrit. Of interest to us is The existence of Shambo, Shambhala nota s a geographic place or as a part of history. It is a concept, an idea. This concept, it was suggested is an image of something that will happen and that will manifest itself in a place but Shambo is a mystery, a hidden path. No-one has ever revealed the answer to this mystery. We are at the end of a civilization at the end of a cycle. This time we may reach the etherizatione of our planet. This does not mean that everything will disappear but just that what I have experienced in astral journeys all people on earth will also be able to experience in the same way. I mean all will know how to leave their body for an astral journey with physical sensations as we know them on earth but in a grander dimension. We are generally afraid of what we don’t know but we are approaching something truly extraordinary. The Shambhala beings consider us and have always looked upon us as younger brothers and sisters to whom they try to show the path and give advice. They are here to emanate a radiance that each one of uscan use in order to become little by little, like them. Not only similar to them but maybe better in a different way on the path of common love… to reach that which we call true humanity.
