Toho Co., Ltd. A Toho Films and Watanabe Kikaku Co-production 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88... Hey, Mei! Good morning. How are you? Hi, Marie. So-so. How about you? Oh, I made a pile last night. I see. Sorry, bad smell? - Yeah. - I see. Just a moment. Smells better now, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah... At least let me have a good wash once in a while. There's an 8 hour time difference between Amsterdam and Japan. When it's 5 p.m. in Japan, I get a fixed time call from the head office in Osaka. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Transfer, please. Hello? Hello! Boss, is that you? It's me. Yes, yes, I'm doing well. Listen up, the ultra-thin condom is really popular, yeah. The toys aren't selling well. Yes, yes. And also, about the pants. The ones with replaceable condoms. Prepare 4 cases with those. Send them as soon as possible. Yes, yes. And about the other thing. Yes, well, I'll be flying back there soon. So when I arrive, I'll see Nakatsugi. And also, you shouldn't wander around in Africa. Yeah. Oh, right... Boss, you played around when you came here last time, didn't you? That one's a disease carrier after all. Yes. I'm not lying. Oh, right. About my salary... Hello? Hello! Hallo? I guess I went a little too far.

Excuse me. Oh, I'm sorry. - What is it? - Nothing. Let's go. She said "I'm sorry". Make sure to keep your promise. If you fail... I know. I don't want to be killed, yet. This man's a guerrilla leader. He might be the only regular customer I have as a fourth-rate businessman, but he's really going to kill me if I don't keep my promise. That's scary. He's Oil Minister Ali? Have a smoke? They're Peace cigarettes. Peace? Peace. Katayama, give me that document. This is Prime Minister Nakada's message to His Majesty. And this message is from His Majesty to your Prime Minister. No! Meet Mr. Pierre Duras. He's world's most famous cameraman. I gave him priority to collect news materials. But Minister, I don't think our meeting should be made public. Our policy has changed. Mr. Masaoka. It's well known that the Masaoka Organization you established is not only for investigation. A journalist friend of mine said you're Japan's CIA director. This is first class, please return to your seat. Now this is a surprise. Oil Minister Ali and Dainippon Trading, huh? I wonder what are they after? Ah! I know that woman! What? Oh, sorry. I'm talking to myself. You're beautiful. Thank you. It's me who consulted with the guerrillas, don't forget that. It is you who will be in a spot if the guns don't go through Sicily. That way you take a 4% commission. - No-no-no... 7%. - Too much. 7%. Then, forget it. No-no-no... Please, please. Sit down, sit down. Please, please. This guy's an Italian from the Sicily island. I sometimes think he's a member of the Mafia. Maybe I watched too many movies. - OK? - OK. Who's that man? Which man? The American with the girl. What is it worth to you? Uh? He is Stanley of the Pentagon. He showed up in Amsterdam this week. He's a bright boy in the Pentagon. He is good at picking up girls. I'll be back soon. Watch out. Let's go. Let's go. - Have Katayama bring the car outside. - Yes, sir. Hello. Your hometown is Nakasato in Tsugaru, right? You're that head fisherman's only daughter. It's me. It's me. I knew it was you. I saw you swim naked while I was doing this. You were so dazzling that I thought I'd go blind for looking straight. I may have been 16 at that time, but you were glowing. I couldn't forget about you these 12 years. Oh! Your fly is open. Really? You're the son of the fisherman from Kodomari. The boy who proposed and sent me love letters every day. When did you recognize me? When we first met at the airport. Darn it. Um… Can you go out with me for a day? - Why not? - I can't. Then, um... How about to my room? I'll feed you some Tsugaru hot pot. - Really? - Really. Then, will you come to my place's opening? Let me see. "Restaurant Japan" This is your place? - That's right. - Wow. Sakuta. I just came back from Congo. - Hi-hi you two. - That doesn't look cheap. Oh, thank you very much. No! - Did I make you wait? - Not at all. Stop by the Schiphol Airport first. - Around 50s is also fine. - No. I said no. Mr. Masaoka. Excuse me, you're Mr. Masaoka from Dainippon Trading, right? Oh I'm sorry... Or should I say Mr. Masaoka from the Masaoka Organization? Is there something that you want? Well, um... I have some information that you might like to hear. And you are? I'm Mei Sakuta from the Konishi Corporation. I don't think you've heard of it though. We're trading commodities to Africa. Very well, I'll give you one minute. In the front? Use the interphone in front of you. Aa... Can you hear me? You've heard about polypropylene, right? It's a material you get from petroleum products. Um... It's the thing that everyone's in a craze for since the world oil crisis. So? 8,000 tons of that polypropylene are about to be shipped from a certain harbor. Right now it's first come, first served. - What's the unit price? - 200,000 dollars. That's too cheap. It's because the owner is selling in a haste. - What do you say? - Where's the owner? Where's the shipping harbor? Mr. Masaoka. I believe the deal comes first. Will you buy or not? It must be this… Andre, stop. Stop! Mr. Masaoka, what do you say? Your minute is over, get off. You better believe what I just said. Mr. Masaoka, what do you say? Ouch... Dear Mei, how have you been? We're all doing fine over here. I didn't want to start the letter with this, but we really counted on the money you sent last month. However, that wasn't even half of the amount you've promised. You need to keep your promise if you're a man. You've always been kind, so don't act tough. It's not good to pretend if things become difficult. You're always quick to make a pass at a cute girl when you see one. And that's even worse. You won't embarrass only yourself if you do that in a foreign country, but Japan as well. I'm the one who gave birth to you, so I'd also have to atone for your wrongdoings with my life. Wait a minute. Shut up. I'm cuming. - Hey, wait a minute. - I'm cuming. What a minute, I said. What's wrong with you? Yeah. We're here to search your place. You're under suspicion of smuggling narcotics. Don't you speak English. Say that again? Under suspicion of what? Smuggling narcotics. Hey, what's happening Mei? It's the Police. Pay the woman and send her home. She's my girlfriend. Shall I let them in? Sure, we can't refuse the Police. Get dressed and wait out there. Who's the informer? A Japanese? You stink! Go wash and put some clothes on. You're such an idiot. That's right. It was Shimizu. - What a dirty move. - What? Hey, Marie, are you going to work this evening? What are you doing in there? Come on, hurry. Don't worry, I'll get Shimizu here for you. Hey, a new Japanese restaurant again. You're sorry you can't afford it, can you? Shut up. It looks like the Japanese are invading. Dainippon and Wittinstein. The world's biggest merchants of death together. Why can't you understand there's nothing there, except what you see. Can't you have this done before they get shipped this afternoon? Yes. Unless we find some narcotics, of course. Shit. I hear these Japanese rifles are excellent. Yeah, very. I wish I could kill my wife with this gun. Just use whatever you can, fool. Here comes the lady-killer. Oh, I'm sorry. Two weeks ago I saw the same gun in Africa. Really? The dead guerrillas had guns like this. But my guns are going to Sicily. Look. It's not my rifle. It's a machine gun. I know. But you can remodel your guns into submachine guns very easily. That's why you're sending them to Sicily. What do you want to say? Stop! You son of a bitch. You bastard, I'll teach you not to look down on Japanese people? Here I go. Don't be a fool. Your guns are killing many people today. So what? I'm only promoting legal trade. Leave me alone. One more flash... and you get yours. Hey, Mei! - Have you seen Shimizu? - He's in bed with Marie. Wait, give me a cigarette. Thank you. I think they are in bed now. Marie, it's impossible, I can't get it up. Four times... Can't let you go yet. Hey, you're late. Sakuta! Shimizu. How dare you snitch, you son of a bitch? You're the only one who knew that the M1s will be shipped this morning. So what? - Africa isn't for everybody. - It's a misunderstanding. Hey, hey... Marie, give me a razor. - I don't want any murder in my house. - I won't kill him. OK. - Marie, help me. - OK, OK. I might chop it off if you keep moving. So you two were accomplices? Sniff this. Sniff it. It stinks. - Now, if you'll excuse me. - Go ahead. Wow, this is splendid. Hey, this means you're done now. Serves you right. Such flashy moves are dangerous. Oyane, the Minister of International Trade and Industry is also here. Oyane, Masaoka… And also Bunzo Shikauchi, the ambassador in the Netherlands. The stage is set now. You must be Sakuta from the Konishi Corporation, right? Yes. How can I help you? The Japanese Association sent you a notice this morning, did you receive it? If it's about the membership fee... I'll pay it very soon. No-no, there's no need anymore. You have been excluded. Why is that? This right here. Oh, this? What about it? This isn't a place for someone like you. Mama, come here for a moment. This is unpleasant, could you send him away? Otherwise, we would have to leave. Then, the Japanese Association will never step foot in here. Allow me to escort you to the front door. - Please. - Hey, you. Ah, please excuse me. - Just come quietly. - No. I also have a minimum of freedom. I don't want to go today. Today, I refuse. Who's that man? No comment again? What's the Minister of International Trade and Industry here for? What do you want to know that for? To blackmail Masaoka. Don't be a fool. With all of them gathered there... There must be something going on. You don't know the power of Dainippon Trading. - So that means you do? - I do. What do you know? I know that you have no chance of winning. You're surprisingly untidy. I can only afford cheap stuff. Then, I'll buy you one as a present sometime. Hey, prepare me some Tsugaru hot pot someday, all right? Look here. I made this in Africa. It's gold-plated. It's my apartment key. It's gold-plated. Pierre Duras founded this photo agency, Veritas, in 1972. Faithful to the name of his agency, he does not cease his efforts to reveal the truth all over the world. To Mr. Duras, the camera is a lethal weapon. Oh? That's Counselor Suzuki from the Japanese Embassy. Give me a moment, please. Here you are. I had a call from the museum. They spotted a man. They think he's a member of the Red Army. - I have some questions to ask you. - Wait a minute. I'm talking with my friend. But come in, it won't take long. - Hello. - Hello. Sit down, we won't be long. Do you find me naive, huh? - That's actually my weapon. - Definitely, I agree. But thinking about it, while you're playing the lamb the wolves are lurking behind you and one day they will eliminate you. So be careful, little lamb. Even of him. And for a good reason, I'll also be keeping an eye on him. I'm just killing time with him. Because I like him. And we're also from the same generation. He's also trying his best. But it's all in vain. It's because he doesn't get it. I'm going to accuse him. I understand that it's necessary to hate the wolf. But I'm going to corner the wolf. No matter how risky it is. All right, very well. Be careful. Ah... Um... Sayonara. Goodbye. Ciao. Ciao. Was it you who turned me to the police? Answer me. Yeah. Me. That was dirty! Why did you expose me to the public? Why did you put my photo in an exhibition? That's for myself... And also for my generation. Why did you attack me in the newspapers? You had to be sacrificed as a sheep to catch the wolf. Damn it, what do you think I am? I feel sorry for you. But somebody will make a move. When he'll read the paper. Who? Can't tell you now. Just a big shot. Very big. Don't try to meddle in my business again. I understand your anger. But I've seen many young men killed on battlefields. They were whites, blacks, Asians... All of my generation. We, the survivors, have many things to do. Oh, such sentimentalism is not my idea of the world. Calm down. And you'll find who your real enemy is. She's Masaoka's woman. You know that? Yeah, so what? What... She didn't come to Amsterdam to run the Japan Restaurant. What for, then? Ask her. Ah, that scared me. What's wrong? Why did you come to Amsterdam? Could you hurry up? I don't want to be late for my appointment. She's Masaoka's woman. You know that? Hey. Hey! I'm leaving, you hear me? I'm leaving! Damn it... - I'm leaving you behind. - Uh-huh. Get on. It's cold. You're going to get raped, you hear me?! - Raped, he said... - I won't ask you anything. Get on already. Really? It's so windy. But I had fun today. Will you take me there again? Ouch... Hot! - And 7. - I want to go home, but I can not. Oh, I want to go home... 8. All right. Phone. The phone. Osaka. It's Osaka. Yeah, yeah, yeah... Hello. Oh, it's you boss? Why call so early? Oh right, what about the disease? So you caught it after all. Why are you angry? Huh? Order to suspend business? Did the company shut down? Uh? But we've been trading rifles for a year now. Don't ask me. Hello? Boss! Your Excellency. Why did you make your agreement for oil support with Japan only? Because our country is looking forward to Japan's economical operation and induction of industrial engineering. Yeah, but surely Japan is not the only country that can fulfill your needs. You have a wife, don't you? There are many women in the world. Why did you choose her? I have a question for Mr. Oyane. I understand the Japanese economic cooperation policies include the exportation of military weapon supplies. Is that correct? As everyone knows, Japan has three principles against exportation of weapons. We never export weapons, never did, never will. Your Excellency, have you forgotten the case where a Japanese trading company exported weapons to Africa via Amsterdam? And I can tell you exactly the dates. - June the 4th this year. - They are not weapons. Not weapons? What then? Sporting rifles. You idiot. According to the idea of the Japanese government, rifles are weapons when used by military man but not when used by guerrillas? Don't you think that is a silly question? Would you please answer my question sir? In my country there's a proverb that only fools answer willful questions. Thank you very much, sir. Hey, Mei! Good morning. How are you? I got fired. What? My company went kaput. Really? - Bad smell? - Yeah, as usual. The police sent me a commercial visa cancellation notice. Without it, I won't be able to get even a dish-washer part-time job. I have to get it back if I want to survive in Amsterdam. Mei, did you really get fired? What'chu gonna do now? Ah, come on, don't let them get you down. Hey, that food isn't good for you. Have some of this and you'll feel better. Don't worry, I'll feed you if you don't get work. No matter what you say our regulations will not allow us to give you commercial visa since you don't have a job any longer. I know you have regulations, but please do me a favor. I'm begging you, please. Come on, I'll gift you a wig when you come to Japan. Oh, like him? Yes, he's a good example. The Konishi Corporation wasn't the only one that shut down. But also Shimizu's, Koyanagi's and Yoshimura's company. The rats bellow the 5990th totally got us. Everything will be over if they take away our trading companies' licenses. Masaoka's the one trying to drive me out of Amsterdam. But why? I could turn that into money if I were to find out why. Some big money. You idiot! You corn! Wanna come over today? I wanna make you a Tsugaru hot pot. Yeah. I'll buy a fresh cod for it. See you then. All right. Coming. Coming, coming. What... What do you want? Hey. I'm waiting for someone. What's going on? What's going on? Well, have a seat. You guys think it's my fault that you got fired? - Who else's fault could it be? - Well, isn't it obvious? Or are you too scared to confront Masaoka? Just give up. You son of a bitch, our lives are on the line here. Hot pot... The hot pot... Razor, where's the razor? Bastard, this is payback for the other day. His pants, get his pants down. What are you people doing? Stop it! What are you doing? This isn't over, you son of a bitch! Just you wait! What should I do? - Turn off the stove. - Uh? - The hot pot... - Oh. And get me a towel. A towel. Are you all right? Uh-huh. Does it hurt? I'm sorry that I can't serve you my Tsugaru hot pot. I heard that your companies got shut down. And I warned you. Careful. Are you all right? This is yours. It's a necktie for you. I wonder what time is it now? 3 o'clock. There are still things left to be washed... But I'm going to have to go without trying out your Tsugaru hot pot. I wish you well, even when you return to Japan. Careful not to catch a cold. What is it? I'm not going back to Japan, just so you know. I see. Open the door, please. Just because we were a hindrance to Masaoka... Masaoka has... He met with Oil Minister Ali. Oyane, the Minister of International Trade and Industry was at the party. Why is that? Tell me. You should return to Japan. Go back to Tsugaru. All right? All right? Please tell me. What in the world is Masaoka planning? Please tell me. I beg you. But... What is he after? You know, I... I'm not Masaoka's woman. I'm not the owner of "Restaurant Japan" either. That's all just a camouflage. You know, I... I was brought to Amsterdam to sell my body. I'm just a prostitute well past her prime. When my husband passed away... Masaoka told me that he had embezzled 500 million from the Dainippon Bank. And my husband invested all of them into stocks for 4 years. And when it was all gone... ...he selfishly took his own life. So they called the police on you? Why not? Dainippon can't even let go a mere 500 million Yen. So they brought me here instead of taking me to the police. They're going to have me work until I die. Do you understand now? I'm borrowing your phone. Call Mr. Katayama, please. I apologize for being late. I'm heading towards the hotel right now. Could you please tell me Mr. Stanley's room number? I will go there without fail. I'm borrowing your bathroom. [Harumi Miyako's "The One I Fell In Love With" playing in the background] Why didn't you die together with the man you love? Uh? Just hang yourself and die! Die! Can you lend me an umbrella? I'm not lending you any umbrellas. I see. Wait a minute. You forgot something. Just throw it away if you don't want it. Excuse me. What are you doing? I... I've always wanted to make love to you. - You sure are hungry. - I haven't ate since yesterday night. Oh, that's right... Do you know this one? Ah… that's right. It's almost Christmas. Uh-huh. What if Masaoka comes here to pick you up? I won't fall in love with anyone anymore. That includes you too. It'll sound better if you place it here. All right, all right. Fine, fine. It'll sound even better on your ass. - Ass. Your ass... - No. No. It'll sound even better here. Wow! I saw it! "I'm going to do the groceries", huh? Hey, Mei! Good morning. How are you? I'm doing good. Marie, I'm sorry. It looks like I'm in love with a Japanese woman. I'm sorry. What? Did you make a lot last night? No, I haven't been feeling so good, so I didn't make much. I see. Next time, after you get better, let's do that all night. - What? - That! Oh, sex... right? Wow, dutch woman are so blunt. Yikes. Thank you. Two soups. They had Chinese cabbage. - I want to pickle it. - We have no rice-bran paste. I'll pickle it in salt. Here you go. Thank you. Oh, it's delicious. Uh-huh, it's good. No... Ah! Hey, they're dropping. Just forget about them, it's hard to get them back with all the cars. Thank you. I'm lending this. Just wait a minute! I'll never forget you. Ryo! Open up! Hey Mei, that car you use is a mess. Dumb bitch, I'll let you have it for 3,000 Guilder, deal? A drowned body in the canal? It's a Japanese apparently. Hi, it's been a long time. You know this man, don't you? No. You turned pale just now, tell me who's this man. I'm busy. Come with me to the station. Come on, hurry up. Why don't you cooperate with us? He's Japanese. One of your countrymen. Hey Sakuta, come on. You know what happens if you refuse to witness. What should I say? I don't know anything! There's nothing we can do. Let him go and have him followed. Okay, that's enough, you may go. You again? I wanna talk to you. Freck off! It's about Masaoka. Ali and Oyane flew to West Germany. The one following on the heels of the first. Oyane disclosed in a previous interview at Bruxelles that he will give an economical aid of 2,000 billion Yen to the barter of crude oil. However this could not simply be for the construction of a kombinat. So what? It's a barter for the trade of oil. For military weapons. And it's not just any weapon. I think it's nuclear. Nuclear? Officially it's to construct an atomic furnace. For peace-time industries. But once an atomic furnace is built it's easy to produce plutonium bombs with it. But Japan is unable to supply nuclear weapons. It can. - With the help of West Germany. - West Germany? What do you mean? That's all I know. Now it's your turn to pick. What do the police think? Murder? I don't know. The drowned man had something to do with him. His name is Kazuo Takimura. Age unknown. He was under special contract with Masaoka. I think I know this man. A British high official. And this one? He's the president of the Geoffrin Konzern. There are big men in the political and economical world. They have had business transactions with Dainippon Trading. Masaoka is good at finding the weak points of the man he deals with. Then he attacks them deadly and persistently. Especially when sex is concerned. If a customer wants a woman he sends Ryo Nakatsu. If a man, Kazuo Takimura. But now Takimura is dead. If he was murdered... Who will be the next victim? If you want to save a life, tell me everything. I have the press behind me. I can do things you can't. I am tired of being everybody's scapegoat. Katayama! Get over here. Hey, where did Ryo Nakatsu go? Get your hands off. Where is she? Director Masaoka wants to meet with you. Come tomorrow at 7 p.m. to "Restaurant Japan". I'm not waiting till tomorrow. Take me there now. Director Masaoka is not in Amsterdam right now. Where is he? - Leave that vase here. - Yes, Ma'am. - And also, put that there. - Yes, Ma'am. Welcome. Excuse me, is Mama here? - Right here. - Welcome. Let me take your coat. Excuse me, are you Mr. Sakuta? Yes. We were waiting for you. This way, please. Excuse me... Since when you've been the Mama here? Excuse me. I brought Mr. Sakuta. Come in. So you have two demands, am I right? The first one is to set Ryo Nakatsu free. And the other one is to reissue your business visa. And if I don't accept these two conditions, you will make public Dainippon Trading's scandal. Right? You only have two trump cards to threaten me with. One is the 500 million Yen embezzlement case. And the other one is what I've been using Ryo Nakatsu for. I have one more ace up my sleeve. Kazuo Takimura, the drowned body found yesterday. Mr. Masaoka, I know your method very well. Kazuo Takimura for the homosexuals and Ryo Nakatsu for the others, right? I see you've become friends with Pierre Duras, haven't you? Actually, 2 days from tomorrow, we're having a garden party in a certain place, you see. You can take what I'm about to ask as a personal request from me. How about it? In exchange for granting your two requests, could you play Kazuo Takimura's role at the party tomorrow? Uh... You will be very well rewarded for your sacrifice, of course. I want to ask you two things. Where is Ryo Nakatsu now? In London. London... There's nothing to worry about. My company might do anything to make money, but a morgue is not in our plans, yet. And what's your other question? Who's my partner at the party? I admire your disposition. But it's unfortunate that you're lacking in power. And what is power? Well, just spend the night here and think about it well. - Who owns this castle? - Please, right on, please. What do you think about these Japanese? What do they want? Let's head to the riding ground. Fritz! Fritz! - How long have you been here? - Huh? How long have you been here? All my life. I was born here. Who owns this castle? Mr. Friedrich. Friedrich? More exactly, Wittinstein the Fifth. Wittinstein the Fifth? The Steel King of West Germany? Steel King of the world. Of the world? Of the world... Fritz! Come by me. That old gentleman is Mr. Friedrich. And the young man? His secretary, Mr. Fritz Rosen. We have the pleasure of presenting you Miss Ryo Nakatsu. Please. Allow me the honor of serving you the traditional Japanese tea. Koto... Prepare the koto. Your Excellencies. This way please. This is Japanese sake. What's your name? He's asking what is your name. I'm Mei Sakuta. You are like Rimbaud's poems. Come to my room afterwards. "Drop by my room afterwards" he said. - Fritz, is it all prepared? - Yes, it is. Follow me. Why is your Excellence in such a rush? Hm... That's a difficult question. Excuse me, but why is that? Why do world's powerful people prefer war over peace? The explanation for that is very simple. Your body is the trump card. We can't just give up on the polypropylene contract. And I'm the one who informed you about that polypropylene. I'll pay you the fee for that. But it all depends on you. If you satisfy the Fifth... Fuck you! You think that if the Fifth keeps quiet you'd pocket it all yourself, didn't you? If you go into the Fifth's bedroom... I can guarantee her freedom. What proof do I have that you'll keep your promise? You're gonna throw me in the canal too? You can have my life. Shoot me with this if I fail to keep my promise. How much is your company making with this deal? 10 billion? Excuse me, but I would never stake my life over such a petty amount. As you might know, Dainippon Trading has 120 branches in 72 countries around the world. Wherever in the world you might be I could get in touch with you through a single telex. So I don't have more than 5 minutes to decide? Tomorrow, when you leave this castle... ...bring Ryo Nakatsu. Because we're going on a trip. That's fine by me. If we want money, we'll look for a Dainippon Trading branch and send you a telex from there. - I'll set the price. - I agree. In 5 minutes, the branch manager there... ...will pay you the amount that you requested, as per my instruction. We're going to ask you for money all our life, you know. Well, it all depends on how long you will live. Dainippon Trading will not go bankrupt so easy. Are those all your conditions? - No, I got one more. - No, that will be enough. I want to slap your face! You'll never understand how I feel... ...about giving my ass to that geezer! Very well. But, even if you were to refuse, no matter how many insects like you assemble, you will never take Dainippon Trading down. The Fifth is waiting for you. Go quickly. You are punctual. Come. I desire you. There's a Verlaine poem that reminds of you. I came, a calm orphan Rich only by my tranquil eyes Towards the men of great cities They found much to despise I hope you don't find me despicable. Drink. My heart was rushing. As I was patiently waiting for you. I'm afraid of a kiss As of a bee. I suffer and stay awake Without resting: I'm afraid of a kiss! Do you understand how I feel? I want to hold you in my arms. What did you mix with the champagne? I'm someone tormented by solitude. Listen to me. I need your beauty. And I need your savage Asiatic blood. Hit me! Hit me. Hit me! Hit me! Hit me. Hit me. Hit me! Fritz! Bring Caesar! Fritz! Bring Caesar here! I'll teach you what pain is! Fritz! Fritz! Do it if you dare. Do it! Just kill me! Shit! Hey, make sure Ali doesn't find out. Stand up. Stand up. Don't look at me like that! I'm... I... I'm an idiot. Where did you get this from? Mr. Katayama… He wants us to commit suicide? You can shoot me. Cover your ears. Tell Masaoka that... ...we're not killing ourselves. If he wants us dead, he should do it himself. Just stain Dainippon Trading's hands with our blood! - So the Fifth is alive? - Of course the Fifth is alive. Nothing happened here. Right? Isn't that right? The Fifth just went to the airport and took a private plane back to Germany. So the one wearing sunglasses was his double? To the Wittinstein house their reputation is more important than the Fifth's death, I see. I feel pity for the Fifth. Well then. I no longer have a reason to keep you imprisoned in this castle. And that's because… ...the Fifth is still alive. You're free to leave this place when day breaks. This is my letter of credit. When in need, if you show this at a branch office somewhere it will help fulfill our arrangement. Bring me the money. Here's some pocket money for now. Oh, tomorrow I'm thinking of gifting you an automobile. So that you two can continue your fun journey together. Why aren't you killing us right here and right now? The Fifth is alive, I said. Hey, Sakuta. A certain cameraman is waiting for you two to go to him. But I believe it's clear as day. Whether to live a happy life with my letter of credit or throw away you lives. It's all up to you. What about you? Great. Then let us drink in celebration of your journey together. The break and oil look fine as well. No bomb planted either. What about the luggage? Shall we? I know Wittinstein is dead. Look. Tell me what happened in the castle. If you testify, we can stop the nuclear weapons. ...1200th anniversary of the German aristocratic house of Wittinstein, Friedrich Wittinstein the Fifth spoke to the several thousand workers of his main factory in Essen, West Germany today. He thank them for their fidelity and their unceasing efforts to develop ever higher quality products at an ever increasing rate of production. He's a fake! A few weeks from now it will be announced that he died of a fatal disease. You know their secret and they're going to kill you. Don't you understand? You must know too. Tell me! Tell me! I'll be waiting for your death. I'll write about you. I'll write the truth. Why? Why do you want to die so quickly? Thank you. I can hear it. The sound of the sea. It's the sea in Tsugaru. Rock-paper-scissors. Let's play the warship game. Warship-warship-explosion. Sinking-warship-explosion. Explosion-warship-sinking. Warship-warship-explosion. Explosion-explosion-sinking. Sinking-warship-explosion. Explosion-sinking-warship. Warship... Sinking-explosion-warship. Un-Undress me. I'm hungry. Want me to make you an omelette? Fried eggs would be better. All right. Oh my darling, oh my darling, oh my darling Clementine You are lost and gone forever, dreadful sorry, Clementine Oh my darling, oh my darling, Oh my darling... Translation by bLoodZ THE END
