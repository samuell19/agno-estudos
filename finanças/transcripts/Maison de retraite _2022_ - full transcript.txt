Orphanage of Forgeac 1995 Hurry up, Milann, soon everyone will have to wait for us. That's not cool. I think it's the flu or worse like I have stones in my throat. You have nothing. come. -I am ill. Look, there's bacteria here. - Nonsense, come now and don't forget your bag. Come on, Milan. Action. And if they ask what my parents do? -Make something up. Fireman. Or better, superhero. -Ready for the new school year, boys? Or wizard, or actor, or lawyer. No, that's stupid. Good morning. 20 years later Good morning, Milan. How are you feeling this morning? Slept good. Get up, you have to work. - Really can't. I am ill. I think it's the flu or worse. If I swallow... it feels crazy, like there are stones in my throat. I don't have time for this. Gamed all night again? No. -Take your responsibility. Work somewhere for longer than two days. Then everyone would be happy. And I've told you so many times that this is my view of the counter. It's not an ashtray, it's a work of art... and it means a lot to me. -Sorry. I won't keep saying it, I'm not your mother. Very funny. -What? That dress. Crazy to practice such a serious profession in a dress. Speaking of dresses. Miss Romer. You quickly closed the elevator door again while she stood with groceries. She files a complaint. - I hate the elderly. Do you remember Mrs. Gonzalez from the orphanage? That sister of 102? You had to kiss her for a candy. A nightmare. She had a goatee. Traumatic. I still see her when I eat a candy. Milann, just try your best. Yes. -Be nice to the neighbors... and keep this job. It'll be fine. It's a fun job, no bullshit. Hey, Milann, old buddy. moncef. You look good. Do you go to the gym a lot? Where is my money? -That's why I'm in a hurry. I'm going to those Icelanders. You will get it next week. The Icelanders. They're working on global warming. Yes, they warm up... -The whole climate? It's taking me too long. It is now 3500 with the interest. Do you understand? 3200 and we don't talk about it anymore? - Lift that old woman up. I will be clear. I'll have my money in a week or I'll kill you. Understood? Yes. -And now salt it up. I know where you live, don't you? Please. -Thank you. Have a nice day. Good morning. So, let's start with a leek. Hurry up, there are people waiting. Okay, that's it, ma'am. 22.35 euros, please. How much was it again? -22.35. Come on, hurry up. There is a queue. -Yes, wait. One euro. One euro twenty. 32... Oh, forgot. I have receipts. I have a receipt for ravioli with bechamel sauce. These coupons have expired. Since 2014. Not at all. Give me my ravioli. Ma'am, those coupons you gave me were for a promotion... which ended in the 11th century. bastard. I want to speak to the director. -Is that old woman crazy? Get lost. -Are you all right? What is it? -He's cheeky, curses... and he won't give my ravioli. - Aren't you ashamed? She said I could eat the pot. -I'm terribly sorry, Mrs. Fanond. It must be a mistake. Your ravioli. This is the last time I hire a useless bastard. Apologize. Sorry. She raises her middle finger. This is getting embarrassing. -She's doing it again. Enough. Pack your things and go. -That's okay with me. Damn. Are you crazy? Are you insane, sir? -Madam? Shame on you to beat up an old woman like that. And? The good news: She's still alive. -Thank God. And the good, I mean the bad news? -She's charging you with attempted murder... and the supermarket for vandalism. -It was an accident. According to the clients, you were very aggressive towards that woman. Do you really believe her now? She held up her middle finger. I'm tired of your bullshit. Now you listen to me. I made a deal. You don't have to go to jail and that's a miracle. You have to give something back to the state. -What? 300 hours of community service. -How long is that? Two months. -That's doable. In a retirement home. Is this a joke? -No. I said you have nothing against the elderly... and have worked in an Ehpad. -What's that? A kind of retirement home. Say you worked there. I'd rather go to jail. -Now you have to cut. This is not a joke. I'm tired of solving your problems. Listen, tomorrow morning you report... at 17 Rue Georges Clémenceau in Louveciennes at the stroke of 8 o'clock. And watch your count, or I'll kick you out of the house. Just remember, I'll keep you out of jail. No prison? unbelievable. New inhabitant? -No, I'm Milann Rousseau... When you come to work, take the service entrance. Understood? Come with me. Good start. Run through. You work from 7.30 to 5.30 or from ten to eight with an hour break. We demand punctuality here. Seven thirty is not five past seven. Five minutes can mean a lifetime. You have to clock in every morning on entry and clock out as you go. Have you already worked with the elderly? -Yes. That's right. I have worked in an Ehpad. That is to help the elderly with their sense of touch. They cannot open the screen with their wrinkled fingers. And because they're old, facial recognition doesn't work anymore either, so... Good. Your job is to lend everyone a hand. From carers to cleaners. You are not allowed to go out with the residents... without my permission. It is forbidden to smoke... to call, mistreat an elderly person, or become too attached to them. If you violate those rules, I must inform the judge administering the sentence. Once too late is a warning, three warnings, to jail. Marion will guide you. Welcome to Mimosas. It is important that you know all the habits of the residents. That's Alfred de Gonzague. He has Alzheimer's. Keep an eye on him. Okay? That's Claudine Valège, she doesn't stand out, but meanwhile she acts secretly. Okay? You can say hello. Hello. Alfred. -Nice to meet you, Milan. Alfred. -I'm Milan. al-fred. Hello. -I'm Claudine. Nice to meet you. -How handsome he is, isn't he? I'm Alfred. This is the living room. Here they come to relax and do nothing. There's Leontine. She doesn't see a whistle. You mustn't lose sight of her. Okay? That's Edmond van der Wer. Five years ago he lost his partner... and he has been depressed ever since. Stop coughing or die. Choose. I am allergic. -That's Sylvette Leroux. A big mouth. Make her like you. We go on. Move forward. This is not the time to die. Jump in place. Jump. Jump. The woman who dances the zouk is Fleurette Jean-Marie, the youngest resident. That's Simone Tournier. I love her. She will never give you trouble. Keep moving, take a deep breath and relax your sphincter. Where is the 'sphinster'? -In the US, near Massa-Suzette. Everyone say hello to our new prisoner. Bye, prisoner. -Super. Do not worry. That's Albania. A centipede. Gym coach and caregiver. Very nice and cool. -We are only love. Are you coming? Always pay close attention, especially if they are waddling. And you should always disinfect hands. Always. And most importantly. You are obliged to wear the work clothes. I do not do that. Good morning, Mr. Max. Room 19 is Lino Vartan, a former boxing champion. Go get acquainted. That is not possible. I'm not there yet. -Do not worry. He is independent. You go in and ask if he needs anything. Okay? Come on, he's nice. Go ahead. Good morning. Can I do something for you? -Hop up. Sorry? What did you say. -That you had to leave. Very nice. Good morning, Mrs. Michet. How are you? Good. Here we go. Go ahead. So. Is it going well? -Yes. I help her shower and you change the sheets, okay? Did you sleep well? -Yes. Gadver. My God, I can't do this. Oh, I can't do this. I can't do this. Yes? -There is a problem. What? -That old lady, she... It's everywhere. It's a bloodbath. A little respect, madam hears it. Clean it up, that's part of your job. I really can't. This is my first day. If anything, go to Ferrand, okay? - Please, Marion, I beg you. Please, it's my first day. Oh shit. Alright then. Come on, you can do it. You are stronger than this. Come on. Come on, put it on. Come on. Oh lala, what have you done to us, Mrs. Michet? Is this an all-you-can-eat buffet? Oh shit, shit. Oh god damn it. If it goes well, it will happen to us too. -Fuck your bed? No, growing old, the only alternative not to die young. He's not relaxed. -That's Erwann, head of security. Not nice, but not bothersome. -It does bother me. Close that window. Have you ever seen such an ugly one? -Yeah, he wasn't lucky. This can not be. -You can't do that. We hear nothing. -Calm down, I'll turn it up. harder. What a bag of tobacco. -I can hear you. At least you're not deaf, kid. He deserved it. What's on the agenda. -The new one has come. That prisoner. He doesn't seem very nice to me. -They never are. The last one was like that. He almost killed an old woman with a cash drawer. We have to be careful. I felt his negative energy. -Who are we talking about? They have served rotten meat again. Nearly two dead. Check the fridge. Both of you check the expiration dates, huh? Good, huh? In two days we're going for fondue. As far as that prisoner is concerned, we're keeping an eye on him. Hello. -Hey. How was your first day? -Don't open my mouth, hell. It's terrible, I can never last two months there. The warden is horrible and his head of security thinks he works in Alcatraz. A guy doesn't want you in his room. An ex-boxer, a scary dude. They are all scary. - You have to hold on. It will do you good, just watch. Groucho Marx once said: Inside every old man is a young person who wonders what happened. Service entrance My back hasn't been scratched in years. -Then you'll have to be patient a little longer. I'm not actually a hairdresser. Go away. Yes that is good. -So? No. -I do not do that. Stop. -I'll try. Shut your mouth or I'll do it. Go away. That's Annonciat, my grandson. He lives in Australia. Did you know that kangaroos are left-wing? -Buoys. What? -Like whales. Leontine, let's go for a walk. She wanted it herself. I didn't want to hurt her. -Who wants to bounce with me? You mustn't say that, Leontine. -Fuck me. I'm going. -I want to see your cock and your balls. Shows. Go away. I wasn't even inside. Your mouth. your shoes. Why are you staring at me all the time? Do you understand it now? This morning the caretaker made a mistake. -That's bad luck. My luck has left with Georges. You would have liked him. Where is he now? -In heaven. Is he a pilot? I don't think Ferrand likes me. -You imagine that. What are they doing here? -Confession. Is he a priest? -No, he has Alzheimer's. What is the connection? -Everything you tell him, he forgets. They open their hearts and he has company. Everyone happy. So this is basically a madhouse. Why don't we take them for a walk? That is not possible. -How so? That would be dangerous for their safety. They are vulnerable. What? Do they never leave the home? Those are the rules and we stick to them. Yes, you have to follow the rules. Okay? I won. -No, because with little war... Whoever has the highest value card wins. To win you must have the highest card. You have an 8, I the king. So I won and on the same card we have to duel. Okay? Okay. So I won. Moncef: My money, motherfucker Who is it? -Nothing. It's Alfred. It's Alfred. Inside. Who are you? Marilyn Monroe. Am I lucky. rascal. Milann, it's eight o'clock. I slept through the alarm clock. Shit, shit. Nice day. You're too late. -Yes, I'm sorry. My alarm did not go off. -First warning... two more and you're out. And those headphones stay off. I feel better. -It shows. That's Therese, Aymeric... and Jean-Nicole. Jean-Nicole? Is his name Jean-Nicole? Yes. -Yes. Does Jean-Nicole often visit? -No. Nobody comes. End of meal in 20 minutes. If you're late, hurry up. Thank you. Seeing Alfred does me good. Also visit him. Tell me. -It'll stay between us. Sure. -I told my secret. I've been told I'm gay. We already knew he was a fag. It drips off. Who is gay? -We'll tell you later. Awesome. That you feel better. -I don't show anything so as not to shock. But what I heard now. It seems Alfred and Claudine are doing it. No, I don't believe that. -I swear. Is that still possible at that age? Gadver. How dirty. The thought alone makes me puke. -No, there's nothing wrong with that. I think it's cute. -They love eachother. I hate it here. All day they are shitting, eating, pissing... Lucky we shit, moron. Alfred does not. Alfred does not. Insulting us about the speakers. -Bad talk. Yes, it's a shame. -Yes, and disgusting too. We are humiliated enough without such a bastard insulting us. Go away. It's hell. -Oh no. It's not true. -What? You turned on the speakers. What now? What must we do? -Maybe they haven't heard anything. They are all deaf. -Calm down. We already knew you were gay. We don't care. Snow sucker. He deserves punishment. -Yes, we have to teach him a lesson. I say the snake. -That is not enough. Yes. -We need to scare him off a lot. That he will never forget. -I know something. The watering can. -No. Yes. -You're not going to give him the watering can, are you? I will. Yes. Inside. Inside. I need you. -For real? Yes. I want to ask you a favor. -Is that right? Come with me. come. Come closer. I do not bite. Could you maybe... -What? Help me. Can you maybe... -What can I possibly do? Can you... Can you... Yes. Can you hold my cock when I pee? Did you do that? -Yes. I'm afraid of him. He has been a boxer and he leads a gang of seven. Like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Wait, so maid, guard, attendant... jack of all trades, cleaning lady... Your resume is getting pretty long. Very funny. I like your oldies. Did I miss something? I met someone. -No. Now tell me. We've seen each other three times now. And to be honest, I'm a little bit in love. How nice. I am happy for you. The payments haven't come in, right? I've been waiting in vain for three days now. Solve it. That's your job. damn. Keep an eye on him. There are two new applications and there is mail for the seniors. Singles only. -Sure. Throw the mail away. -As always. Speaking of deadlines, Leontine's birthday is next week. Should we raise money? -What do you want to give her? Cataract surgery? -Who are we talking about? The mechanism of my bed is still broken. Since July. Only from my bed. I'm always unlucky. -We'll take care of it. For real. I'm going to ask Ferrand for my day pass anyway. I can't miss the boxing match. He always says no. -We will see. Mr Vartan, unfortunately I cannot give you a day pass due to insurance. It's too risky and two caretakers are absent. No one can come with you. I was expecting this answer, but I don't need a caregiver. I'm going with the new one, that jailer, the one with those cold hands. That is not possible. Milann has to stay in the home. I'm going anyway. -Like I just explained... Your explanation does not interest me. We take a lot, but there is a limit. Come on. -It's for your good. Our good? We haven't been outside for two years. You spend a fortune on that stupid gate, but not a penny for excursions. Do you think we are dogs? -No. Dogs? -Mr. Vartan. This crap. -Calm down. Stop. Calm down, Lino. You are crazy. Come with me. -I'm coming. He's good for the asylum. -Bastard. Take a seat. There you go. I'll be back in five minutes. -Good. What do you think? I finished level 11. You ask for it. Now I have to break everything. You make me do it, you stupid bastard. Here. Give him plenty of it. Well done. Lift him up. Stand me up. You know I don't like violence. I hate that. However? -Look at him. You know it. Where's my money? Was I not clear? Destroy everything. You get a week. I swear. Did you understand me? A week, no more. What kind of mess is this? -Do not worry. I'll explain. I'm all ears. -Well... I borrowed money from Moncef. -Don't you ever learn? Sorry. -Stop it. You've been saying sorry every day for 20 years. Stop that. I'm a lawyer. Do you ever think of me too? To my reputation? You don't care. Damn. Why are you borrowing money from him? A while back for the rent. -The rent? One time you pay rent, you borrow it from a bastard who just got out. You are kidding me. You know what? Pack up your things and hoop. I'm sick of it. Out. I've been taking this shit for 20 years. You pack your things and go. It is over. Oh, is it you. My God, what happened. -Oh, it's nothing. Nothing? come. Come with me. What is that? -A recipe from my grandmother. Vinegar with thyme. Then it heals faster. Thank you. I owe you. -Stop. You shouldn't think that when people do something for you, they expect something in return. People can also just be nice. However? It would do you good if you were nice every now and then. What do you think of that? You are right. What are those bags for? I collect those. We old folks have all kinds of quirks. You don't have to understand that. And what's in your bag? All that matters. My PlayStation. What did you do for work, Simone? -I taught French in high school. And you? -I dropped out of school. It wasn't for me. -Didn't your parents push you? They died when I was little. I was sent to an orphanage. Poor boy. That must have been awful. Didn't you have any family? Yes, a grandfather, but he didn't want me. Now I understand better. -What? Why you can't stand oldies. Actually I don't know any. -Horrible. My grandfather is by the way... That man died two years later. -How sad. That's life. I'm used to it. And you? Do you have a husband? Children? -No children. I had a partner for 40 years, but we had no children. We were happy and never found out who it was. And one day... One day he got his assistant pregnant. He left me the day I retired. In one fell swoop I changed from 'in a relationship' to 'active'... to 'retired'... and 'alone'. Without transition period. I'm sorry for you. That's life. Like you said yourself. Do you know... I have not behaved properly here. For what it's worth, I'll say I'm sorry. That's sweet. We've all been young. So don't worry. Would you like a glass of water? -Yes please. Simon, what is it? - That kid got beat up yesterday. What do we care? - His deserved wages. We have to help him. He is an orphan, like us. How sad. - He did say terrible things. Don't blow it up like that. -It's tough here for a boy like him. Put yourself in him. It's heartbreaking. Would you like to take care of him? Please. Help him. - Help him? Come on. I'll see. I do not know. What happened? -Senseless violence. Do you know why you should get on the mat? -No. You left Mr Gourand on the toilet, fool. That's negligence. That is very serious. This is your second warning. There is also not enough staff. -What? Nothing. -And now get out. Keep an eye on him. It's a burden. - Then fire him. That is only allowed after three warnings and thanks to that guy we get a subsidy. Inside. Good morning. -Hello. Hello, Mr. Director. -Hi, Fleurette. Since the menu is almost always the same, let me suggest some recipes. Can I show them? -Naturally. Here. I thought of Chicken Colombo. Everyone loves chicken. With Creole rice or banana au gratin. For dessert I thought of coconut flan or bananas flambéed with rum from Guadeloupe. Very good, Fleurette. I submit it to the kitchen. Thank you. Goodbye, Mr. Director. -Goodbye, Fleurette. It was a pleasure. I do this with your recipes. Good. Good morning. -Good morning. Will you stop saying good morning like that? You don't say 'good morning', but 'good morning'. With a clear and enthusiastic voice. The day has begun. We are happy. forward. Come on. Good morning. -Sorry, I didn't hear you. Good morning. -That's the spirit. Now we are in touch. Are you beat up? So behave better. Start by respecting others. What time do you have a break? Now. I expect you on the terrace in 10 minutes. It's quiet there. Okay, have fun. What does he have? -Just go. Do not be afraid. Good morning. -Good morning. See. Good morning. What have you done? A loan not repaid. -How much? 3500 euros. Rule #1: Pay off your debts. Rule 2: Learn to defend yourself. Come on, put this on. Please. Boxing takes patience and concentration. Everything you lack, but need. Take your cover position. Right foot back, arms up, ready to attack. obliquely. Are you left or right? -Left. Then put your right arm back and distribute your weight between your two legs. Knees slightly bent and turn around your opponent... to unbalance him so he can't attack. Always unbalance. Come on, you have to move. Arms higher. Higher. Not so high, now you get a blow. Cover yourself. Shows. Left, right, left, left, right. Uppercut, a corner. You are in good shape. You have three enemies in boxing. Fury... stress and anxiety. If you step into the ring scared, you're done. You make wrong choices. In the ring you are prey and predator at the same time. Just like in life. Life is like a boxing match. You have several rounds, sometimes you lose, sometimes you win. Sometimes you deal blows, sometimes you have to take it, but you always get back up. Always. Simone told me about your problems. Listen... Do you know what your greatest strength is? Your pain here. Every superhero has their dark moments. Okay, you're orphaned, you're one lap behind, that's harsh and unfair. But you have two choices. Either you give up or you're on... and you fight. The choice is yours. And what do you think? Everyone has something. I have also seen better days. I've lost my family, but now... i have a new one. Yes, I'm sick. And that's not easy, but I don't let myself be known. When life knocks me down, I hit back. All you have to do is live. Being there, totally, in the moment. The rest is nonsense. Come on, take your position. Come on, move. Move. Give a punch. Go ahead. Left, right now. Left right. If so. In order not to cash in, you have to move. To keep moving. Right, move, forward. Box, box. This way you can pay your debts if you are broke. If so. There, there. Never lower your cover. You see? In order not to cash in, you have to stay out of reach. Sorry. I hurt you. -I'm fine. You have to go for a run and jump rope. Increase your lung capacity. -I'm exhausted. Don't say or I'll say you touched my dick. It's going again. Unfortunately. I would have loved to go to a game with you, but they won't let us go here. That's for your safety. Do you believe it? Tonight you can sleep at Fleurette's. -Thank you. You have to thank Simone, not me. A sweet woman. What are you two doing here? Milann talks about life out here. It must be great, too bad we can't leave. We have to escape sometime. -Don't spout nonsense. And now out of here. And quickly a little. busy. That side. Did I tell you how I met Baptiste? -Yes, you told me. But you don't know he loved trees as much as I did. Do you understand? Nature gives a lot, but you have to show interest. But you do everything fast. You talk fast, eat fast, think fast. Why the rush? I do not know. -Nature takes its time. If you go too hard, you'll get crushed. I recommend that you talk to trees. What? -Let your anger out. I already have trouble talking to people, let alone trees. Try it. Inside. Who are you? Monica Bellucci. What a lucky bastard I am. Global warming is causing more floods and landslides. We thought of you and respected the earth. You respect nothing. -Sorry, Fleurette. Do you ever sleep or do you just keep going? It doesn't work that way. My biological clock is set for the Antilles. Now it is six o'clock in Guadeloupe. And I go to bed when it's 8 o'clock there. It's drink time for me now. I'll make you a cocktail. You're drinking, right? Go ahead, let's have a cocktail. Rock your hips. -So? Yes. Are you sleeping already? I didn't see you sleeping. I wanted to tell you about the Antillean carnival. Have you ever heard about that? -No. The highlight of Carnival is Fat Tuesday. The party starts on Fat Sunday, then you get Fat Monday and Fat Tuesday. On Wednesday, Ash Wednesday, we burn Vaval. Sorry, Fleurette, isn't there a carnival of sleep? We don't sleep during Carnival, we do rest on Thursday. We start on Sunday and rest on Thursday when Vaval is burned. Okay, because I really have to burn Vaval right now. You are very pretty. Thank you. But what good is it. I am in love with a man who forgets me. What a dork. Have you ever been in love? -What is it, being in love? Wait a minute, do you realize what we're risking? 20 years in prison, but we're already in jail. Thanks to whom? Alfred. -Oh yeah. But what exactly are those clothes for? To wear. -Naturally. Here. A small selection. Very sweet, but there's no place. Books are not useful. They come in handy. Everything you are looking for can be found in books. Really. I would rather have a TV for my Play Station. A television? And what else? To the left. Left. To the left. Over there. -Over there. Straight ahead. To the Pipeplane. -I am going already. Take the nitro booster. Straight on to the Pipe Plane. Hit him. Grab his pole. The pole. Yes. We won. Who is the king of the piles? That's the weapon. -I'm the pole. Good Lord. How exciting. I can see why guys like this so much. unbelievable. Yeah, crazy, huh? -A nice game. Really amazing. Guard. Get rid of it before Ferrand gives you a hard time. Really amazing. I usually play games in my head. In my imagination. Close your eyes. Imagine you are walking in a forest. Suddenly you see a cave. Are you going in or are you walking through? Don't think, answer right away. Immediately. Do you see it? -I do not know. What does that cave look like? Is there music, light? You decide. Do not think too much. You see that cave, do you go in or not. No. Why not? I do not want any problems. You may find your happiness in that cave. I'm not going in. -You see? Those who do not enter are afraid of death. Of course I'm afraid of death. You not? No, you have no use for fear. It's like guilt, bullshit. Yes. -No, but it's stupid... Shall we light one up? - Someone's coming soon. You're afraid of everything but holding my cock. We wouldn't talk about that anymore. I need to go to the toilet. Would you like to come? I'm just kidding. Be right back. Lino Vartan has a great evening. So. The Imaginary Disease Molière... Please leave my toes whole if you can. -I'm trying my best. I also want a Brazilian wax. -What? I'm kidding. Terrible to be orphaned. But you could also be dead. Or in a wheelchair. - Thank you, Sylvette. You know how to cheer a person up, don't you? -Get clean socks from my room. Your restaurant's menu? Frankfurter with sauerkraut. 35 francs. A time unknown to the youth. - Laugh at me. People were fighting for a table. They came for me too. Everyone loved me and you know why? In life you have to be a good listener. be attentive. There is a difference between "How is your son?" or "How is Paul?" If you show respect, you will get it in return. Yes, chief. -You got it. Yes Yes. Bye, Edmond. Erwann asked me to give you pills. No, they are too strong. It makes me lifeless. They're just drugs. You exaggerate. It's a little sugar with vitamins. Yes. Sugar and vitamins. Okay, we're making a deal. I'll take one and you take one. Okay? Good. -Attention. So. Do you want tea? -Good. You have many friends. -Oh no, that's the list of doctors. Please. What kind of work have you done, Edmond? -I assisted the ambassador in the Netherlands. That was the beautiful life with my Georges. The journeys. The encounters. That was amazing. And the theatre. I like the theatre. Passion. Molière, alexandrines. 'Agnes, don't think of marriage lightly. A woman owes a lot to her position.' Beautiful. We went once a week. It was my passion. I'm sorry I can't go anymore. Are you okay, Milan? Strong that pill. -It was just sugar, right? come say. Our greatest sorrow was that we never had children. At the time, homosexuality was not accepted. We were seen as sick and had to hide. It's not much different today, is it? I agree with you. -See, Milan. Those drugs are way too strong. Look at him now. Inside. Stand still. What is it? The pills you give... they are mega strong. -Cut to the chase. Can I take Edmond to the theater? He wants so badly. There's a piece of Molière... -No. Why not? I'll go with him and stay with him. I said no'. Go away. It's ridiculous that no one is ever allowed to leave here. They are always locked up. How so? -Mind your own business. Out. ...consists of a pom... ...consists... It exists... That's easy. ...and a special gibberish, which give words as causes... and promises as results. It's a sign of human weakness... but says nothing about their medicine. They know, my brother... everything from humanisms... humanities. They know, brother... Funny, they said that too. Inside. Who are you? Madonna. How lucky am I. Madonna. -Yes. That's true. What is he doing? So doctors don't know anything? -Yes, my brother. They are learned and very nice. They speak beautiful Latin. They know the Greek names of diseases, can describe and distinguish them. But cured have not eaten cheese. However, you will have to admit... that doctors know more about these matters than others. They know what I've said, but that doesn't cure anything yet. And the art of their craft is pompous nonsense and special gibberish... who give words as causes and promises as results. Bravo. But there are men as wise and clever as you, and when they are sick... they go to the doctor anyway. That's a sign of human weakness, but it doesn't say anything about their medicine. To me you are The Imaginary Disease. Now that you can't go to the theater, it's coming to you. Thank you. Today we are going to play a new game. It's called 'turning a bottle'. Okay? It's very simple. We spin this bottle, someone points it out, we spin again... and then someone else is assigned and those two people kiss. Attention, the tension is rising. That's me. And that's Leontine. Kiss Me. One two... I'm doing it right tight, so that gives you a boost. Left, left, left, right. To focus. One two... Never mind. Act or truth? Ask Sylvette an embarrassing question. What's the most embarrassing place you've had sex? In a German tank. All right, let's play bingo. I want to show you something beautiful. Is that your husband? You made a beautiful couple. -Yes. That's what everyone said. Did he die? -Yes, six years ago. We had just celebrated our 39th anniversary. Beautiful. I don't know if I'll make it. -Of course it is. But love doesn't always look like love in the beginning. You must be observant and always treat women well. And you never had children. -No Unfortunately not. Michel was sterile. Crazy that no one here has kids. -Now you say it. Everyone I speak to has no family or children. Strange right? Maybe coincidence. -It's very coincidental. Come on with the one on the left. Not bad. But go underneath. What a dork. He has no guts. Not everyone can be the great Lino Vartan. If I was really the great Lino, I'd be out of here a long time ago. Well, I'll have a cup of tea. Don't, let me, that's better. Yes. My little Milan. -Can we talk? Naturally. -Something isn't right here, isn't it? How so? -No one has family. No visitors ever come, you never go out, the food is filthy... So? -You are treated badly. That's not true, we're just unlucky. That's exactly what I mean. - Stay out of it. We already have the counsel of the wise and help each other. I also want to help. If there's anything wrong, I'll go to Ferrand. You do nothing. You are an intelligent boy. You'll be ready in ten days. Don't ruin it now. Don't worry about us. You told me not to be afraid and to enter the cave. Which cave? He is different. It's a good kid. Resident contracts What are you doing here? I wanted to speak to you. - Are you kidding me? This was in the basement. -He's been sleeping here for weeks. Is this a hotel? This is the third warning. I'll call the judge. Yes, I'd like to explain to her why I'm staying here longer. I take care of the residents. You treat them like garbage and take them hostage. No visitors, no outings. And I'm sure it won't stop there. Are you not ashamed? -Take his pass and throw it out. First you sign off my hours. So. You're a free man and now get out. Get out. Run through. acorns. God damn it can still do that. - Do you work with old people now? Do you think we wouldn't find you? You'd be better off having the cash. -It's really not working out right now, guys. Oh, are we going to act tough? Tering, I disabled them. What happened? Are you OK? -Yes Yes. Oh, you took them down. How well did you hit them? Tell me everything. Are you really going to make it? -Yes, don't worry. Have a nice evening. -I'll wait till I know you can stay. That is nice. -Don't mention it. Thank you. -Just go. With Lino. Speak something. -Hello, Lino, with Milann. You should hear now. I beat up Moncef's men. I have followed your advice. I wasn't scared. I kept my cover high, just like you said. All thanks to you, so just wanted to say thank you. Amazing what you have done for me. Thanks, I mean it. Hello. -Hello. Sorry to interrupt, but is Samy home? Glad you're here. -Indeed. Sorry about last. -Let's forget about it. Come in. We're really glad you're here. And? She is cute. You are beautiful together. Has she been approved? -Yes, I'm happy for you. Stopped smoking? Yes, it actually happened naturally. And Snow White? Have those seven dwarfs done you any good? I want to show you something. Can you view these contracts? They are from the retirement home. Did you take pictures? Why? -Because it's not right there. Shows. Women, I love you. A new message. Lino, with Milan. You should hear now. I beat up Moncef's men. I have followed your advice. I wasn't scared. I kept my cover high, as you said. All thanks to you, so I just wanted to say thank you. It's amazing what you've done for me. Thank you. That's good, little Milann. I'm happy. Shit, I completely forgot about you. It's lino. -What? He passed away last night. That bad. He had a weak heart. -It's not the home's fault. He had been ill for some time. We have to go. See you later. Did you know him? -No. I like going to cemeteries. At my age it's like looking at houses. You were right. They are being ripped off. -Damn. I knew it. Very cleverly set up. In short: Ferrand inherits everything. When they come to the home, they give him all the rights. He is the beneficiary of their life insurance policy. The contracts state that they cannot dispose of their money... without permission from Mimosas. -What villains. They even receive state aid. They seek out their customers very well. Only people without family or children. singles. It is clearly an abuse of power, but difficult to prosecute. There may be a possibility. Ferrand legally inherits everything... as long as the inhabitants live in Mimosas. If they leave, the contract will expire. -Then we have to get them out. Do you know how risky it is to take them with you? Before I got there, I was a guy who always played the victim. That's behind me now. I have to help them. We have to do it for them, for their dignity and for Lino. And if they don't want to? -We're gonna make it. Okay? We do it on Fat Tuesday. Today is carnival. Everyone wears the same costume. Me too... so I can sneak in and explain everything to them. Nice to see you. I can't be here, so listen up. Ferrand is a con man and picks you bald. You relinquish all your property to him. -Will the bad luck never end? There is one way out. Escape. -Where do we have to go? That's my pack-an. Are you participating? Yes. -Absolute. When we do it, we do it together. -Of course, Simone. Are you sure we're going to make it? -No, but we'll do our best. And then at least we tried. Thank you, Milan. You know, we're among the ones nobody cares about. Those who are dead before they have died. We are the ghosts of society. We are there, but not really. We are actually a burden to everyone. -Thanks to you, we don't feel that way. We feel alive again. -And that, that's priceless. When are we going to do it? - Six o'clock in the morning. Wait, isn't that rushed? We must act quickly. Take as little stuff with you as possible. Okay? The plan is very simple. Listen carefully. Are we meeting in the gym or in the dining room? The gym. -Not true. In the dining room. Wait, who's keeping watch? It's not that complicated. You watch the guard. You, on Ferrand. And you... How do you remember that? I didn't remember. -Yeah, you just told me. What? I'm Alfred. -Listen, De Gonzague. Do not mess with me. You remember the plan perfectly. Sorry. I have to confess something. It's not easy to confess. I... I don't have Alzheimer's. -For real? What? -Really? Don't you have Alzheimer's? -It's not true. Why did you lie? -I don't know. It wasn't intentional. When I came here I wanted to be left alone. So that no one would ask me what I had done before and then... when you went to confession to me... I couldn't stop and continued. I saw it did you good. And me too, so... I haven't thought about it. I felt.. I felt useful. And at my age, what could be more important... then feel useful? Sorry I lied. Forgive me. And to think I confessed to him that I only have one testicle. Claudine, I beg you. I ask your forgiveness. Sorry. With all my hair on my head. I understand how you feel, but I didn't mean to hurt you. Would you have slept with me if I hadn't had Alzheimer's? Then we would never have had such a beautiful love story. Open now. Will you marry me? Are you OK? -What should I choose? That's my whole life. I don't know if I want to get out of here. -Believe me, it's for our good. Just pack the essentials. That's all. Come on. -Yes. Tomorrow we are free. See you tomorrow. -See you tomorrow. A new life. Tonight we eat at 7 o'clock, then the lights go out. It's half past five. What are we doing? -We're sticking to the plan. Come on, Fleurette. -Yes I go. Good luck. -Thank you. Okay, kids. Get ready, huh? Call me when the payments are made. I trust you. Guard. Inside. I'll call you right back. Hello, sir. I have so much to tell you. I have good news from my grandson. -Good thing, too. And your daughter? -I do not have that. Then the shoe pinches. Your daughter would cook for you. I made these fritters for you. They are still warm. I do not have time. I have work to do. -Then eat them when you have time. Precisely. Hi, Mr. Ferrand. -Hi, Fleurette. Carefully. So. Totally awesome. Let's go. And quiet, huh? Marion, are you there? -Yes. All right, let's go. Go, go, go. Hey Hello. We're going down to... -Okay. ...play a board game. We love games. This can no longer be the case. It drafted everywhere. We're still freezing. come. come. Fast. Run through. Come on, quick. st. Come on, hurry up. Where is that going? Ferrand may very well catch you on the first try. He's smart and has cameras everywhere. Then you try again the next day. Fleurette, you're making fritters with those special spices again. Leave them in Ferrand's room. He won't eat them, but someone else will. What about transport? -Alban found a bus. Did Alban find a bus? -Yes. A bus? -Indeed. What the hell are they doing? They don't expect another attempt so soon. You may have to fight for it, but don't let that stop you. Okay? Yes, I'll call you back. Where are they? What's that supposed to do? -That hurts, doesn't it? Erwann. Fast. Come with me. Fast. Awesome. Fantastic, Sylvette. Well done. Hurry up. They escape. Go after it by car. Come immediately. We'll get them. They're behind us. -They have clubs. So exciting. Go see if they need anything. -I am coming. Hold on tight. Get out, you bastard. Get off that bus. To get off. I have been there. You give me back my oldies and forget everything you've seen. Otherwise I will destroy you. Did you think you could outsmart me? Wanted to be a superhero? They're mine. Do you hear me? Mine. What a crazy person. You're going to jail for good. You've been there, convict. Do you hear me? You are dead. I'm the asshole. Go get Leontine. -Who are they? Who are those clowns. -What's the problem? Piss off. Get in. Fast. -Yes. You haven't got rid of me yet. You go in the bin. You all. Not you. - Shut up and get out of here. What am I to do with you? Do I have to taser your mother? You're lucky you have friends. I swear. Especially that Marion is a real brother. She's like my little sister. She paid your debt. Aren't you ashamed? I like honest people. She told me what you did for the old ones. For Leontine and all that. That is good. Leontine watched me grow up, she changed my diapers, she's like... Leontine. How are you? -Who is that? It's me, Moncef. You looked after me when I was little. In the shower. Hopla boom hopla shower, raise your feet, raise your hands Now your cheeks. Oh my Moncef. fuck me. -What? She is tired. -Indeed, from the bus trip. We go. I don't want to see you in the neighborhood anymore. Okay? Take care of yourself. -I will. Thanks? Why didn't you say anything? -I didn't pay for it. It was Lino. It's a good boy. I was all set to grow them. I wanted to hit them everywhere. I was furious. -I've seen it. Come on, Leontine. Yes. I want to marry you. Where are we going? -They can't stay on the bus. Trust me now. ORGANIZATIONAL HOME OF FORGEAC I had other orphans in mind. Thank you. -Carefully. Welcome. Get out carefully. Welcome home. What an honor to open this home. It is neither a retirement home nor an orphanage... but both. Here a different everyday life awaits them. Our orphans can grow up among warm people and thus have a family. We are pleased to be in Europe for the first time... to open a family home for seniors and orphans... that it will be called Lino Vartan Home. Congratulations, Milan. Thank you. Mimosas is on the news. Daniel Ferrand, director of the Mimosas home has been found guilty... He has to go to prison for two years and pay a fine of 375,000 euros. Inspectors must go to all Ehpads and retirement homes... to investigate whether seniors are being abused or mistreated. unbelievable. Do you realize what this means? I'm proud of you. Lino would have been proud too. - Thank you, brother. Will I see you? We will now look at the future tense. It's on the board. The future tense is about an action that has yet to take place. Or a ban. For example. How beautiful he is, isn't he? What's your name? -My name is Alfred. And you? -Adele. Shall we play a game? It's called 'War'. The highest card wins. We are going to start. In sexual relations... there must always be permission from both persons. And if there are three of you? We have blind finches and veal shank. Blind finches, blind finches. So. If you hug plants and trees, they will hug you back. That's what I do. I'm so unlucky. -I have found my spiritual son. What's going on, man? -I miss my parents. I'm scared alone. -You are not alone. We are here for you. Come, dry your tears. We're going to play a game. Close your eyes. Imagine that you are walking in the forest and suddenly you see a cave. Do you go into the cave or do you walk through? I do not know. -Come on, let's go for a walk. And left and right and faster. And shake that ass.
