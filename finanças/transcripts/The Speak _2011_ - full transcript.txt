(abrupt music) - [Louis] All right, Shell, we're live in five, four, three, two... - Are ghosts real? Do they exist? Some experts believe ghosts to be the disembodied spirits or trapped souls of the deceased, while others theorize that they are in fact demons attempting to break through our plane of existence and exert their influence on the human world. Now whether they be spirits or demons, the bigger question is what do they want, and how do we communicate with them? Tonight, my team and I have enlisted the help of a renowned Native American medium to help us tear down the walls between realities and open the doorway between our world and the world of the dead. Directly behind us... Louis! Man, what are you doing? I was on a roll there. - Hold up, man, I got some shit on my lens. - [Shelly] Hurry up. - What are you complaining about? This beats digging ditches for dad, right? - Unless you want me to go to the dark side, let's not talk about dad right now. - [Louis] Man, you're being really undue right now. - Fuck, where was I? - [Louis] The our door into their door thing. - Right, right, okay. Is the hotel in frame? - [Louis] Oh yeah. There, yep, and there you are. Hi. Still rolling. - Directly behind me is the Don Park Hotel. Now it may not look like much right now, but this hotel is widely considered to be one of the most terrifying places in Northern America. Tonight, my team and I will put our reputations on the line, to find indisputable evidence to prove to you, our fans, that otherworldly entities really do exist. Ladies and gentlemen, believers and skeptics, welcome to our final webisode. This is The Perfect Apparition. And cut! Okay, how was that? (laughs) - [Louis] You're like the lovechild of Ryan Seacrest and Joe Rogan, man. - Can you please be serious for a minute? - [Louis] What? Come on. - This has gotta be killer, bro. I've got way too much riding on this. I'm an award-winning filmmaker and they've got me out here in Buttfuck, Egypt. People are expecting more from me. - [Louis] First off, it was a short film, and second off, what people, man? Some web series? No one watches. - You just don't get it. It's make it or break it time, and I'm the guy the network is looking to pull a ghost out of his hat. - [Louis] All right, man, look, I was just messing with you. You look great, the show's gonna rock. Trust me. - I don't look fat? - [Louis] No, you look great, trim, fit. - Fucking fat. - [Louis] No, that whole (laughs) zone time's really paying off, man. - It must be really nice having a job with no pressure. - [Louis] Wait, what the fuck do you mean no pressure? - You pull the trigger on a fucking camera, Louis. - [Louis] Man, that's not cool. - You know what? Give me that thing. - Be careful with that. That's an expensive camera. - [Shelly] A trained monkey could do your job. Is this thing even on? - My camera's like New York, dog. It never sleeps. (laughs) - [Shelly] You think you can do what I do? All right. - Yeah, I do. - [Shelly] Three, two, rolling, go. - Are ghosts real? Do they exist? Some experts think-- - [Shelly] Shut up! - What? (laughs) You're not gonna let me do it? - [Shelly] No, you're such a fucking asshole. - [Louis] I'm just messing around, man, come on. - Yeah, it's not funny. - [Louis] Don't be mad. - There's Paige. - [Louis] Hey, don't run away mad. I love you. - Oh, yeah, I love you. - [Louis] Say it like you mean it. - Love you. - [Louis] Yeah. (laughs) - Hey guys, how's it going? - [Shelly] What's the holdup? - Shelly, please, I've been running around all day trying to get everything together for tonight's shoot. I'm tired, I'm cold, and I'm hungry. - [Louis] Somebody woke up on the wrong side of the rental car. - So? - I have your crew. They're great. They're in the car filling out paperwork. - And? - [Paige] I told them we'd pay them after we wrap. - How much? - You said 250 each. - No, I said 150. - (laughs) No, I have it right here. On the 5th at 4:00pm, you said you'd give them 250. - You need to be a little bit more budget-conscious. - Do you have it or not? I already told them. - Stop freaking out, babe. I've got it. - Don't say that. I hate that. I only freak out because of you two. - [Louis] Me? What did I do? Just running camera here. - We're gonna produce it. - Shelly, I can't pay them in cash. I have to keep a record of everything. - (laughs) Not my problem. Give me some love. - Come on, let's go. Why don't you just let me handle the money? - [Louis] No, because then you'd be in charge of the strippers and booze. - [Shelly] So this is our crew. - Okay. Jackson, Elsa, Malia, this is Shelly Dewise, our director, and this is Louis, his brother, obviously the cameraman. - [Jackson] Here's your paperwork. - Thanks for coming out tonight. It's really hard to find good help these days. - [Jackson] Shelly? - [Shelly] Yeah. It's a family name. - Your mom's? (laughs) I'm just messing with you, man. - [Louis] No actually you're right, it was (laughs) our mom's name. Sorry, bro. - Hi. I'm Malia. Nice to meet you. - [Shelly] Pleasure. - I'm a really big fan of your work. - [Shelly] Oh. (laughs) - Hi. - [Shelly] Thank you. What have you seen? - The documentary you did on autopsies, the one where the skin just peeled off that corpse's body, that was amazing. - [Shelly] Thank you very much. A lot of people didn't quite get how we did that. - [Louis] Yeah, I shot that. - No you didn't. I shot that. - [Louis] I was there the whole, I shot the whole-- - You need to stop telling people this stuff. I hate when you do this to me. Thank you. I really appreciate that. - Genius. I think you're a genius. I can't wait to see what you shoot tonight. - Yeah, speaking of which, where's the man with the keys? - AJ, caretaker. - [Shelly] Wasn't he supposed to be here two hours ago? - Yeah, I don't know where he is. - [Shelly] Maybe you should call him. - I'm doing that right now, Shelly. - Great. - While I'm doing that, why don't we start shooting some B roll and introduce the new team members, hmm? - [Shelly] All righty then. Why don't we start with you? Malia? - Malia. Malia. - Okay. Just go ahead and speak right in the camera for me. - Oh. Okay. Hi. I'm Malia. - [Louis] Malia, hey. (Malia laughs) - I'm 26 years old. I'm from Montana. I'm of Native American descent. My grandfather was a shaman, and ever since I was a child, I've been able to see and communicate with the dead. - [Louis] Now is that something that can be taught? - Why? You wanna learn? - [Louis] No, I was just wondering. That's all. - Oh, okay. - I've had out of body experiences before myself. - [Malia] Really? - Yeah, I saw myself strangling Shelly, and then whoosh, back in my body. (laughs) - Paige Stone, ladies and gentlemen. Oh and don't you worry, she will be with us all night. (Shelly whispers to Paige) - I did. Left a message. - Okay. Jackson. - [Jackson] Yeah? - [Shelly] You're up. - (laughs) You want me on film? - [Paige] Yeah, we wanna get-- - [Shelly] Yeah, if you could, just a little. - [Paige] Everybody on. Your background. - [Shelly] Something about yourself. - My name's Jackson. I'm here to run sound. - [Louis] Hi, Jackson. - Okay. I wasn't hugged much as a child, but I'm starting to feel that this group therapy thing is really gonna help out a lot. - [Shelly] Could you just take this a little more seriously? - (laughs) Oh, you want me to be serious? Oh, sorry. My name's Jackson. I run sound. Was that serious for you? I like studying and researching the unknown, and I've even run sound for a few satanic rituals. - [Shelly] Really? Like what? - Typical shit, people try and talk to dead people, drinking goat's blood, skinning cats, drinking human blood. That Twilight stuff's pretty popular right now. - You watched people skin cats? - Haven't you? - No. - Note to self, never party with that guy. - [Paige] All right, I think next we should-- - [Shelly] Elsa. - [Paige] Yeah. - Hi. I'm Elsa. I'm 25. I am Jack's Velma. He's Freddie. It's from Scooby Doo. - (laughs) That's cute. - You are. I'm from Seattle originally, and we've been here for the last two years running sound, and I'm just really happy to be here. That's it. - Good. I guess that will be the end of the background stuff. I wonder if we're gonna be shooting anything else tonight. - Can I talk to you for a minute? Not you. - [Shelly] What? - [Paige] Don't do that. - [Shelly] Do what? - Talk to me like that. I don't think you have any idea how hard this has been on me. I've been lining up a new crew in every city, finding all the stories, the locations, doing all the background research, booking hotel and travel, uploading the footage. I need a little help, Shelly, a little bit of help. - [Shelly] Why didn't you just ask? - [Jackson] Fucking amateurs. - [Paige] I did ask you, Shelly, and you blew me off. - Why don't you get a peek of this? - [Paige] I can't keep this pace up. I'm 24 years old and I look like I'm 40. - You know that's bullshit. You don't look 40. - Stop. - You look just as prepubescent as ever. - I'm serious. - Okay, listen. - Come on. - We can deal with your workload and your emotional state later. If that caretaker doesn't get here soon, we're gonna lose the night. - I know. - [Jackson] You guys, what's the holdup? - [Paige] We're just waiting on the man with the keys. - [Shelly] Call him. - I'm calling him again right now. - Great. Shouldn't be too much longer. - Hi, is this AJ? You're in the black truck? Hello. You're not AJ? - No, like I said, Doyle. AJ's my son. - It's nice to meet you, Doyle. I'm Paige, the producer. This is Shelly Dewise, our director, rest of the crew. - Nice to meet y'all. (laughs) - It would've been nicer to meet you about two hours ago, but I guess we'll just take what we can get. - Aren't you a ray of sunshine? - [Louis] You have no idea. - You're here to let us in for your son? - Junior is home on his ass, recuperating from a little discussion we had, so I thought I'd come down and tell y'all what's what. - What is what? - It appears Junior decided he could make some money on the side dealing with y'all folks, but I'm in charge of this property, and when I found about his little business venture here, I thought I'd come down by myself. - Well, we're ready whenever you are. If you can let us in, that'd be great. - See, it's just, it's dangerous in there. It's dangerous. There's been a lot of bad history in there. - Which is exactly why we need to get in there. - Yes sir, that's why we did the deal with you several weeks ago. - Hang on now, ma'am, you didn't do a deal with me now. Okay? Let's be clear about that. You did a deal with my bone-head son, okay? - [Shelly] Listen, Doyle, is it? - Yes. - [Shelly] We're all big boys and girls here. We can surely take care of ourselves. - Not in there you can't. Sir, I'm responsible now if I let y'all in there. I'm the one who's responsible. Is this camera on? - Yeah, we're rolling. - Would you tell him to turn it off? Can you turn that off, huh? I said turn it off goddammit! - [Louis] Sorry, sir, sorry. - Motherfucker! - [Louis] Sorry, sir. - Turn that motherfucker off! - [Louis] It's off. It's off. - Stick it in your goddamn ass! - [Paige] Look sir, I am-- - I don't like my picture taken! - It's off, it's off, sir. I really appreciate you wanting to look out for us, but the thing is is that your son signed a contract and already accepted payment. - Enough, enough. Hey, look. This is our finale webisode, and we just really need to get into that building. I'll do whatever it takes to make that happen. Whatever you want. Just what do you want? - (laughs) What do I want? Come on. - Tell you what, I'll give you 50 bucks more than I gave your kid. - It's not about the cash there, guy, okay? - [Shelly] Doyle! - Yep? - [Shelly] How do you like your job? - What do you mean by that? - [Shelly] I'm sure your boss wouldn't like the fact that your son is making money off of his property. I would be pretty upset about that, maybe even upset enough to fire the caretaker. - Wow. Are you threatening me, city boy? If I were a betting man, I'd say you threatened me. - [Shelly] No, that's not a threat. - No? - [Shelly] No, I'm sure you'd love (laughs) an extra eight hours a day at your trailer park. (grunting) - [Louis] Oh, hey! (Shelly laughs) Shell! - Did you get that? Tell me you got that. - [Louis] Oh I got it. - [Shelly] Okay, how about you back up there, Doyle. - How about you not talk shit to me. - Okay. I take it you've had a few run-ins with the law, haven't you? I'd be willing to just keep this between us if you just let us in. - The law? Fuck the law. Fuck it, you win. Let's go. - My kind of guy. Let's do this, guys. - [Doyle] All right. Hope y'all got flashlights, 'cause there's no power in there. - Jackson? - [Jackson] Yeah, I got that covered. - [Doyle] Nothing good's gonna happen when I open this door, you hear me? When I open this door, ain't nothing good gonna happen. - [Shelly] We got you. Just go ahead and leave the scary stories to the professionals. - When you leave, lock the door, if you leave. What's your name? I'm just kidding. (laughs) - Thank you so much for helping us. - Excuse me, ma'am, in all seriousness, I think you're a very nice girl, now why don't you just leave while you can? Just get out while you can. - I really appreciate the concern, Doyle, but I think I'm gonna stay. Thank you so much for your help. Good night. - [Louis] That guy wasn't creepy at all. - [Shelly] Did you kiss you boyfriend good night? - [Paige] Shut up, Shelly. - [Jackson] Place has got quite the ambiance. - [Louis] I like it. It's dark and moody. - [Malia] Like somebody else I know. - [Elsa] I think it's scary. - [Shelly] Are you sensing anything? - I feel something. I'm not quite sure what it is, but it's not very welcoming. - The Charles Manson gang stayed here once. - [Louis] Really? - Yes, Louis, really, which you would know if you read the packet that I gave you. - [Louis] Right. - Were ghosts really here? - [Paige] That's what they say. - [Shelly] Hey Jackson. - [Jackson] Yeah? - Why don't you set up over here? How are you on batteries? - [Jackson] We're good for at least eight hours. Hey you guys, before I forget, please turn off your cellphones. My equipment is very sensitive to interference. - Shelly. - [Shelly] Yeah? - We need to get you mic'ed up. - Be gentle. - All right, all right, guys, I'll mic up Shelly boy. Elsa. You get the rest of the Scooby gang. And you keep your hands to yourself. - Don't worry. I don't touch the help. - Only your brother. - [Louis] Hey. - [Shelly] Are you about ready? - No. I need some time to set up. I wanna take a walk around and see if there's somewhere where I find some better energy. - [Jackson] Listen, I brought three mini DV cameras. You want me to set those up? - Abso-fucking-lutely. Paige? - [Paige] Yeah? - See those notes, let's see, second floor, end of the hall. - [Paige] 207. - Room 207. - How about down this hall right here? - No. How about at the top of the staircase. - Whatever you want. All right, it won't take me too long, just about 10 minutes and I'll be ready. - I'm not even gonna be on camera. - [Elsa] Well you never know. - [Louis] What do we do while they're setting up and the sexy psychic's getting ready? - [Shelly] Paige? - [Paige] Yes? - Why don't you tell the audience a little bit about this place? - What? I've never been on the show before. - Yes, well you just gave me an earful about how you're overburdened with research. Why don't you just tell us about it? - [Louis] Paige. - [Paige] Are you serious? You sure? - Yeah. We don't have anyone else here who's an expert on the history of this place, so I'm sure. - Thanks for the vote of confidence. Geez. All right, I'm just gonna look at my notes really quick. - Okay. You got your notes, and all you have to do is relax. (laughs) - Geez. - Breathe. Louis, just follow us down one of the halls, and you just walk and talk. I do it all the time. You got a... - No! - [Louis] Camera's rolling. - I'm gonna cue you in. You ready? - Okay. - [Louis] Yeah, still rolling. - All right. What can you tell me about the history of this hotel? - The Don Park Hotel was originally built in 1850 by a Miss Jane Zool. She built the hotel on Native American land for these Native Americans that were displaced by the greedy land barons of the time. - (laughs) Cut. You're going way too fast. - [Louis] You look good though. - Yeah. (laughs) Yeah she does. (laughs) - I can slow down. - Slow down. Try to keep a good distance. Don't move the camera too fast. I want it to be smooth. Just take it. I'll start you over. The first owner, how did she die? - [Paige] She died in bed, of natural causes. - [Shelly] Then what? - Then in 1846, the Mayor of the town took the land for himself and turned it into a hotel. A year after that, he killed his wife and his brother in a bloody, gruesome double murder. He hung himself. He hung himself after that. - Oh. Interesting. Where did that take place? - That was all in room 207. One incident that I read about said that he found them having an affair, but another incident said he just went crazy. (slamming) - Okay. (laughs) Go on. - Then, from 1902 to 1922, this woman named Amanda Wiley owned the hotel. She used it to house loggers when the mill opened up. She fell off the roof in the middle of the night, but her death was never fully explained. - What else can you tell us? - It sat vacant until 1945. That's when the state purchased it to house an overflow psychiatric... - What was that? Did you guys hear that? - [Louis] Yes. - Sounded like someone coughing. - They purchased it to house overflow psychiatric patients, and you're gonna love this part, one of the orderlies was discovered to be having sex with the patients, murdering them, and then feeding their bodies to the rats. - [Louis] That's why I never read the packet. - [Paige] The orderly later said that a demon made him do it. - [Shelly] Wow. - [Paige] He was convicted. Executed by electric chair. - [Shelly] Who owns the hotel now? - It belongs to a family trust. Oddly enough, they've never done anything with it. I think it's being sold. - After sifting through all the history about this place, what might you conclude? Hello? Is anybody here? Okay. I think something is trying to communicate with us. This would be the first apparition caught on tape, tonight. Hello? We're not here to harm you. Could you just give us a sign that you're here with us? Oh shit. - [Paige] Oh my gosh. - Let's give this another try. (screaming) (Jackson laughs) Not cool, man! Not cool! - You couldn't see me down there? - [Shelly] No! - (laughs) I'm sorry, I won't do it again. - [Shelly] Yeah, that'd be good. - (laughs) Listen, I've almost got all the cameras set up, and then we'll be almost ready. - [Shelly] Why don't you go ahead and get finished with that? Thank you. - [Jackson] You could even record flying balls. (laughs) - Paige, where do you find these people, huh? - He just heard you say that. - Whatever. Oh my god. - [Louis] I thought it was funny. - [Shelly] You would. - He's really qualified. - That's enough. - We paid 12 hours. - Okay. Where were we? Okay. After sifting through all the history about this place, what would you conclude? - If you examine the evidence, all but the original owner met with tragic, and most times very violent ends. - And? - There's something about this place that has the capacity to drive people to extreme violence. And insanity. - And that's a wrap. That was good. - Yeah? - Yeah, it's gonna be good. (Louis screams) (Shelly laughs) - [Malia] Are you okay? - [Louis] Yeah, fine, just let's make a rule that people warn me when they're about to come into the room. Thanks. - Guys, this really, really isn't a good idea. There's a really bad feeling in here and I don't think I can do it. - Yeah, we just heard all about it. It's gruesome. What? - You don't believe, do you? - (laughs) Believe? Yeah, no. If God exists, may he strike me down. - [Louis] Shell, don't go there with the God thing. - Louis, there is no God. There are no ghosts. And everything is going to be fine. - Okay, well, I can't perform the ceremony, not here. It's too dangerous. I can't do it. - Do you really believe the shit you're selling? - Selling? - Yeah. (laughs) I'm sorry. Come here. Come here. I know why you need the money. Paige told me about your mom. I am more than willing to give you 500. - [Malia] No. - [Shelly] No? - [Malia] I can't. - [Shelly] Okay. Let's see. I've got one two three... (laughs) I'm gonna be driving home on fumes here. I've got $1,000. It's all yours if you do this for me. I need this. Please. Come on. Please. Everything's gonna be okay. It's a goof. - [Malia] It's not a goof. - [Shelley] 1,000 bucks. - [Malia] Okay, fine. I'm gonna need everyone in here, and when this is done, I'm out, no questions asked. - No questions. I'll give this to you when we're done. Louis, round the troops up. Let's pound this out. - On it, bro. See the rack on that Malia chick? We gotta get on that one. Hope she's single. Look, what are these guys doing? - [Jackson] I think that you get your nose any further up that guy's ass, must be getting hard to breathe. - [Elsa] Gee, Jackson, does somebody feel a little bit envious? Unlike somebody I know, Shelly's actually doing something with his talents. (Jackson laughs) (Elsa laughs) - Talent? Talent? You mean his highly polished ability to know fuck all and keep his job? Oh, oh, they went out in the hole. They brought to him a dumb man possessed with a devil. - [Elsa] You know what you always say. Don't hate the player, hate the game. - [Louis] I had a shirt that said that once. - Hey, Louis. We're pretty much ready. - [Louis] Are you sure? Because I can totally give you more time to rip on my brother. - No no no, don't listen to Jackson. He bitches about everything. - I'm sorry, man. I wasn't trying to rip on your brother. Elsa just likes to push my buttons. I didn't mean anything by it. - [Louis] It's cool, man. I have to live with the guy 24/7. - Actually, you know what? In fact, check this shit out, man. I brought an EMF, which is an electronic voice meter, and a ghost meter basically on a K2. It measures electronic voice phenomenon. I know they're gonna need it for the show, so why don't you get this to Paige later, okay? - Okay. - [Louis] Most cool, man. Where did you get that shit? - Told you, I've done a lot of interesting jobs. - [Louis] Oh yeah, about that, is that where you got that Bible quote? - What, are you surprised I can quote scripture? - [Louis] Yeah, actually. Why don't you do another one? - Would it make you feel better? (laughs) - [Louis] Yeah, sort of. - [Elsa] I'm with Louis. - How about, and the scribes came down from Jerusalem, and they said, "He hath Beelzebub," and by the prince of the devils, he casteth out the devils, and the man fell on the ground, wallowing, foaming at the mouth. (laughs) Jesus, what'd he do? He rebuked the foul spirit. You know that one? - [Louis] Nope. (Jackson laughs) Satan, Lucifer, Devil, those are all scary names, but Beezlebub. - It's Beelzebub. - [Louis] Okay, yeah yeah, Beelzebub. That one does nothing for me. It sounds like a redneck clown or something. - What's up, Louis? - [Louis] Oh hey, it looks like it's showtime. - All right. Let's go. Hey, you coming? - [Jackson] No, you guys run along and find Beelzebub. I've got work to do. - [Elsa] We're really gonna miss you. - [Jackson] I know, you will. - [Louis] So long, Jackson. What's the deal with you and Jackson? - Why? Who's asking? - [Louis] Just me. - [Elsa] It's a long story. - Hey guys. Where's Jackson? - [Elsa] He's not coming. - And why not? - It's all right, it doesn't matter. We have enough people to perform the ceremony. Honestly, this really doesn't feel right. It's not a game. Once we invite the spirits here, we can't control the outcome. Do you understand that? - Got it. I think we'll take our chances. Let's just get going. - All right. Everyone, take a place around in the circle. - [Louis] Oh hold up, hold up. Okay. - Okay, everyone kneel. This ritual is called the speak. It removes the veil between the spirit world and our current reality. A sacred object needs to be used to do this, so I'm using my grandmother's amulet. It'll serve as a portal between the two realms. It'll allow the spirits to pass into our realm. We have to make sure that none of us pass into theirs. Are you guys sure you wanna do this? - [Shelly] Yes. - Okay. Everyone join hands. I am the speaker for this place. I come to make contact with the spirits, to acknowledge you. I light this candle in acknowledgement of your presence. May its light reach out across the barriers from this plane to the next, illuminating the passageway between our worlds. May the light from these two candles blend and grow, dispelling all darkness and lighting the way so that all spirits may come to us. We are the speakers for this location. We welcome your presence. We grant you entry. Repeat with me. - [Everyone] We are the speakers for this location. We welcome your presence. We grant you entry. - Again. - [Everyone] We are the speakers for this location. We welcome your presence. We grant you entry. (creaking and rumbling) (crows cawing) (screaming) - [Shelly] What the fuck was that? - [Louis] That's some bullshit right there. - [Malia] I told you. - [Paige] Shelly. - Did you guys hear that? What was that? (screaming) Dude! - What's all the screaming about? - [Shelly] Something is seriously wrong with you, man! - What? - How can we be sure that it worked? - For your sakes, I really hope it didn't. - It was a pleasure doing business with you. - Good luck. - Louis, see her to the door. - [Louis] You don't have to ask me twice. - I hope you don't think I'm a bad person for what I did. - [Louis] What'd you do? You stood in the circle, said some words, lit a candle. What's the big deal? - You really don't understand. What I did in there was real. If I didn't desperately need this money, I wouldn't even be here right now. - [Louis] Yeah, you did have me for a second when the lights went out. - Yeah. Well I guess this is goodbye. - Hey. When we get out of here, can I give you a call? Maybe we can do dinner or something. - (laughs) Yeah. If you get out of here, give me a call. - No no no, when. When we get out of here, I'll give you a call. - Yeah. Be careful. (slamming) Holy shit! - [Louis] What was that? Was that just the wind? - [Malia] We're locked in! - [Louis] What do you mean we're locked in? What the hell? - [Malia] Come on, we gotta get back to the room. - [Louis] Malia, what's going, Malia, what's... What's going on, Malia? Wait up! - [Malia] We're locked in! - [Paige] The door locked by itself? - Uh-huh. - Guys, this is an old building. The door's probably just jammed. - [Louis] It did not (laughs) just jam. I don't know what the hell just happened, but it did not just jam. - [Malia] I warned you guys. The spirits are here. - That's great. What are we waiting for? Let's check it out. - [Louis] Wait, Malia, what's up? Aren't you coming? - No, I'm staying here. - [Louis] Alone? Why? - Because I need to try to save our lives, that's why! - [Louis] Hey, be careful! Shelly? Shelly! - She's right, it's fucking locked. - Try one of the other doors. (slamming) Okay. Louis, here. - [Louis] Yeah, yeah? - Shelly, really, right now? - Yeah, right now. - [Louis] I don't know, man. - Right here. My crew and I have mysteriously been locked into the hotel after performing a Native American ritual known as the speak. Now let's see if we can find some visual evidence of the spirit that's locked us in. - [Louis] Shelly, I don't know, man-- - Louis, stop being a little bitch! It's probably just that psychopath Doyle fucking with our heads, okay? This is great for the show. - I'm gonna call Doyle, see if I can get him. - Just try and get upstairs. Where's Malia? - [Louis] She stayed in the room we did the ritual in! - [Paige] What's going on? - [Elsa] The door. - Did you try the window? Why would there be bricks in here? Why would there be bricks in the window? Let's try the other room. Shelly. This wasn't here before. - That's impossible, unless one of you walked around and checked all the windows, nobody knows shit! - We did walk around the building, and there were no fucking bricks on the windows. - Shelly, something is not right here. We need to get out of here right now. - What the hell? - Hey, I wanna go. Let's leave. - Hey. Come on, people. We're finally getting some really good footage here. What, we're gonna just pack up and leave, because the door's locked? Seriously, this is why we're here! Unless someone's dying, we're not leaving. It's why we're here. Now what room did that guy hang himself in? All right, let's go check it out. What? - All right, Elsa, let's get back to work. - [Shelly] Damn, what's that smell? Paige? - [Paige] Yeah? - I need you to check the room numbers. - [Paige] Yeah, right. 217. 218. It has to be down this way. Shh shh shh shh shh! Did you guys hear that? - Hear what? (wings flapping) I think it's coming from over there. (birds cawing) (door creaking) Like a bird's nest. Where are they? - I don't know. There's no hole in the ceiling. - [Elsa] What's going on, you guys? - Louis. Louis, let's roll in. We're in room 207, site of a gruesome double murder suicide, where it appears crows have been nesting for years, yet there's no visible evidence of an entrance or an exit. In many cultures, crows or ravens are considered to be the scavengers of death. The Don Park Hotel continues to unveil the mysteries of the unknown. (screaming) (crows cawing) Let's get out of here, guys! - [Paige] Shelly, get over here. Get over here! Okay, quick! - [Shelly] All right. - We need to find a fire escape. - No we need to find Malia. - [Paige] We need to go upstairs. (door slams) (screaming) (knocking at the door) - [Elsa] Open the door! Open the door! No! No no no no no! I've gotta find Malia! Louis, come with me! (unintelligible screaming) Jackson! Jackson, Louis! Louis! Jackson! (screaming) (Jackson coughing) (Elsa screaming) Oh my god! Oh my god, Jackson! Breathe. Breathe, breathe. - [Louis] Jackson, you all right? - [Elsa] Oh my god, breathe. Oh my god, Jackson. Are you okay? - [Jackson] Let's get the fuck out of here. Fuck! (Louis coughs) - [Louis] I didn't think this place had power! Oh shit, dude, you scared me. - What happened? - [Louis] Scared the shit out of me. - What happened? - [Louis] We gotta get out of here. This is crazy shit, man. Something just tried to strangle Jackson! - What? Was the camera rolling? - [Louis] Of course the camera was rolling, but fuck the camera, bro! We need to get the fuck out of here! - [Shelly] No, no, pick it up. - [Elsa] What happened? - [Louis] What? - On your solar, rolling now! Everything that happens from here on out I want on tape, okay? - [Louis] Something tried to kill Jackson! - What happened? - I don't know. I was trying to fix the interference with the lofts and I was fucking ripped off of my feet, something fucking grabbed my throat, I was pulled down the hallway. It wasn't fucking Doyle either. - [Malia] You guys said you heard crows, right? - [Shelly] Yeah, in room 207. - [Paige] What do crows have to do with anything? - When crows cry together, it's to confuse the evil entities that wait for the soul to leave the body. They were preparing for Jackson's death. - [Paige] What are you talking about? - We opened a sliver, a crack into the spirit world, but what came through is darker and more powerful than I could've imagined. It's gonna continue to expand, letting any demon or spirit cross over. - [Louis] Cross over and do what? - They're gonna start taking us, one by one. - Well then you need to stop it. You need to turn it off. - I've been trying, but based on what's happened to Jackson, it's too late! The door can be closed, but only at the first light of day. - We're just gonna wait this thing out, and when the sun comes up, we're all gonna leave together. - If any of us make it to see the sunrise. - You are fucking insane! - I'm insane? - [Shelly] Yeah! - Everything I've told you guys has happened! The only way that we can save ourselves is by taking the amulet from the circle at dawn and bringing it into the daylight, shutting the portal. - Somebody fucking help me over here! What's wrong? - [Louis] Guys, Elsa. - [Jackson] Breathe, breathe, Elsa. Ellie, breathe. What's wrong? Lay down lay down lay down. - [Louis] Paige! - [Jackson] You're gonna be okay. Lay down. Lay down. Everything will be okay. - Do not take this woman! Leave here in our realm! - [Jackson] Breathe, Elsa! Breathe, Elsa! - [Louis] Oh my god! - I am the speaker for this place! Do not take this woman! Leave her in our realm! - Breathe! Breathe! Breathe! She's dead. She's fucking dead. You did this. You fucking did this! If it wasn't for you and your fucking goddamn show, she'd be fucking alive! You're gonna die, you motherfucker! - Stop it! Stop it! You wanna blame someone, blame me! I knew the consequences of what I was doing and I did it anyway! She's dead because of me! - [Paige] Guys, you guys, she's not dead. - [Jackson] What the fuck are you talking about? - She's not. She's not dead. Her breathing is really faint, but she's breathing. - [Jackson] Can you hear me? - She's trying to say something. I can't understand what it is. - [Jackson] What's she saying? - [Malia] It's Ottawa. - [Jackson] What? What? What is it? - The bringer of death. The bringer is a demon that takes different forms and it enters the body and it makes people do terrible things. It's impossible. - [Jackson] No, that's... No way. - Paige? - [Paige] Yeah? - [Shelly] What are our options? - I think we should go up. I think we need to go to the roof. - Let's go to the roof, guys. - [Paige] We can't leave Elsa. - No. No. She has to stay here. - [Jackson] I'm not leaving her. - There's no telling what she's capable of! She can't leave! - [Shelly] Be serious, Jackson, come on. - [Jackson] Fuck you, Shelly! - [Shelly] Do you wanna stay here and die? - I'm not fucking leaving her. - [Shelly] Well we are. - [Louis] Hey, Jackson, man. - Don't worry about me. Get the fuck out of here, man! - [Shelly] Louis, come on. - [Louis] Be careful, Jackson. - Don't worry about me. Fuck you, man. - [Shelly] Louis! - [Louis] Yeah, Shelly, I'm coming! - I just hope they're gonna be okay. - [Malia] There's not much we can do for them now. - [Shelly] Do you have some sort of insight in the divine, because I could really use some help right now. - No. But if you're asking what I think we should do, I think you should pray. - [Paige] Let's go back this way. (smashing) - What was that? - Sounded like it was somebody knocking. Does it mean something? - They say that right after someone dies, and you hear a knock in your house, it's them telling you they're all right from the other side. - I remember when my dad died. We used to hear knocks in my apartment. - What happens when it's not all right on the other side? - They knock twice. - That can be confusing. - Wasn't there two knocks? (knocking) Elsa! Elsa! Elsa! Elsa! Elsa! Shelly, get over here! Elsa! Shelly, help me with her! Elsa! - [Shelly] Where's Jackson? - [Paige] We gotta find Jackson. Jackson! - [Shelly] Jackson! - [Paige] Let's go, let's go, we gotta go upstairs. - [Louis] Jackson! - [Shelly] Come on, Louis! - [Louis] He's not here! Jackson's not here! - [Paige] Come on! (girls screaming) - [Louis] You okay, Malia? You okay? You happy, bro? It looks like you got your show. - You think I wanted this to happen? - [Louis] Man, I think you'd do anything if it would get us some-- - Fighting is not gonna help us right now! - Malia's right. We have to get through that door. Come on. Just kick it! Kick it in! - I don't understand! (Louis screams) - [Louis] Shell, Shell, you okay, man? - Yeah. Louis, you were right. Put the camera down. We don't need it. - [Paige] No, Louis, pick it up. - [Louis] What? - [Paige] Pick up that camera. That footage is the only thing that proves that we didn't kill Elsa! Come on, hurry up, we gotta keep moving! - [Louis] Shell, Shell, do you wanna come? - No, I need to sit down. - [Louis] Okay man, stay there, stay there, we'll be right back. Paige, Malia! - I remember reading about this. This floor used to be an orphanage. - The hotel's manifesting past wrongs. - [Paige] For what? - Retribution. Someone has to pay. - [Louis] By someone, you mean us. (kids creepily singing) - Shh. Did you guys hear that? (baby crying) - [Malia] Come on, it's just fucking with us. It's not real. (girls scream) Oh shit! - [Louis] Jackson, man! We thought you were dead! - [Paige] What happened to Elsa? We thought you were supposed to stay with her! - Elsa's fine. - [Louis] Dude, what are you talking about, man? We're fighting for our lives here. Elsa's dead. (Jackson laughs) - They're here. - Jackson? Jackson, what's wrong with you? You're gonna come with us, okay? We're gonna find a way out of here. - [Louis] No, Paige, I don't think he's okay. - Help me with him! - [Louis] Jackson! Jackson! Paige, we gotta get out of here! - Find the fire escape, and we're gonna get Shelly, okay, come on, hurry up! Louis, you go in there, we're gonna go in here. We're gonna go here. - I told you not to film me! - [Louis] Jackson! Hey! Malia? Guys, guys! (crows cawing) (wings flapping) (baby crying) (kids laughing) (heart pounding) (Louis screams) (heart pounding) (wings flapping) Shelly! Guys! (Louis coughs) (knocking) Shelly! Shelly! Shelly! Shelly! Shell! Shell! Guys! Guys! Where'd you guys go? - I don't know what the hell you're talking about. - [Louis] I just searched this entire floor for everyone. You guys were all gone. Shelly's not even here. - Are you okay? - [Louis] No, no, I'm not okay. - All right, come on, let's find Shelly. Come on. - [Louis] Wait, Shelly, that's impossible. Where'd you go? I was just right here. - [Shelly] I haven't moved. - [Louis] What are you talking about? - What'd you find? - We found Jackson. He's alive. - [Louis] Yeah, he's alive, but he's definitely not well. - He's really messed up, Shelly. He disappeared. - We have to be careful. If they've taken him, they're gonna come for us next. - Guys, guys, come here. (Paige coughs) - [Louis] Not that again. - [Shelly] Oh, oh, it's making me so sick. - I don't smell anything. - [Shelly] How do you not smell that? - They're coming for me. I've shamed my family. - [Louis] Malia! - Louis, the amulet. - [Paige] Guys, you guys, there's somebody down there. - [Shelly] It's Doyle! - [Paige] It's Doyle. Doyle! - [Shelly] Doyle! - [Paige] Doyle! - [Shelly] Doyle! What's he doing? - [Malia] He can't save you now. - [Paige] What? (Paige screams) - [Louis] What the... - I'm sorry. - [Louis] Malia, Malia, don't be sorry. Look at me. Look at me. Malia. - Help me! Help! Help! (Malia screams) - [Paige] Malia! (Malia screams) - [Shelly] Oh my god! (Malia screams) (door rattling) Louis, come on! Louis! (screaming) Louis, help me with this door! It won't budge. It won't budge. - [Louis] I was just there and there was a dead end! - [Shelly] That door's open. (screaming) - Guys, is that one of Jackson's cameras? (Jackson screaming) (Jackson laughing) - Back this up. (Paige cries) - [Louis] Oh no, oh no, oh no! (camera buzzes) Got it, got it! - [Shelly] Come on, Louis! This has gotta be it. (Paige coughs) The floor's on fire! - [Paige] No, that's what it wants us to think. It wants us to turn back. I don't see any flames, do you? - [Shelly] It feels real. - [Louis] Keep looking, keep looking. - [Paige] Where the hell do we go? - [Louis] All I can see is two feet in front of my face. (everyone coughing) - [Paige] What is that? - [Louis] I think I see a light up ahead. - [Shelly] I can't see anything either. - [Louis] Wait, Malia? Malia! - [Shelly] Malia! - [Louis] Malia! (door slams) - [Shelly] No, wait, come back! Help us! (banging on the door) - [Paige] She tricked us. - [Louis] No, she wouldn't bring us down here without a reason! Here! See, told you! See, see, told you, fire escape! - [Shelly] It's blocked off! - [Paige] We have to go up, come on. - [Louis] Shell, call Doyle. - [Shelly] It's his voice mail. Doyle, Doyle! We're trapped at the hotel. Doyle, you gotta wake up, man. You're right, we're trapped at the hotel. Please hurry, there's not much time. You'll never make it. - [Louis] No, fuck that, he's just downstairs in his car, he'll come. Find something to throw. - [Shelly] There's nothing up here. - [Louis] Paige? Paige? Paige? - [Shelly] Are you okay? What are you doing? - [Paige] I don't have a choice. I have to do this. - [Shelly] No, no you don't. Paige, you're stronger than this. You are the strongest person I know. Whatever this is, you don't let it control you. - So now I'm strong, huh, Shelly? For years, you've walked all over me, and I let you, because I believed in you. Now I see who you really are. - [Shelly] Paige. - I let you into my life, and for what? You used me! Just like you use anyone you can to get what you want. Even the people that you're supposed to love. (Paige laughs) I don't know why you put up with him, Louis. He's your brother and he's using you too. - [Shelly] Paige, I'm glad you're finally getting this off your chest, but we can get through this, we can. - No. It's too late for that. (Paige screams) - [Shelly] No! (Shelly screams) (Paige laughs) - Not so fast, Shelly! We're not done with you yet. - [Shelly] What do you want from me? (Paige laughs) (Paige screams) - [Louis] You're okay! Stay with us, Paige! - He's still here. He's still here. He's telling me to do things. He's too strong. He's too strong. - [Louis] You gotta fight it. - There's nothing to be afraid of, Louis. - [Louis] Don't talk like that, Paige. - It's too late for me. But you, you're almost home. - [Louis] No! - [Shelly] Paige! - [Louis] Paige! (Louis screams) Oh god! Paige. (Shelly cries) - You okay, man? - Why? - You okay, man? - Why? - We're gonna go. Shell, we're gonna get off this roof. - I'm not leaving Paige. I'm not leaving her. - We're not safe here, man. - Stay until the sun comes up, and then just wait here. - I don't wanna leave Paige either, okay, but you saw what happened to her, man. We're not safe here, not anywhere in this building, not even on the roof, okay? We've gotta go. We've gotta get off this roof. Shell. - She's right. - What? - About me. - No. - Yeah. It's all my fault. - No, man, no. We gotta go, okay? We gotta go. All right, let's go. Come on, Shell. Come on, stay with me, man. Come on, come on. Okay? - [Shelly] Fuck this fucking hotel, man. - [Louis] What the... It's the same hallway! - We were just here. Let's go. I don't think he saw us. (banging on the door) - Hold on, hold on, Shell! Hold on! (guys screaming) Keep holding it, just keep holding it. Keep holding it. Just keep holding it. Just keep holding it. - I thought he didn't see us. (laughs) - It's okay, man, it's okay. We're gonna make it. I know it, I know it, we're gonna make it. - I've been a pretty shitty brother. - What? No, man. You gave me my first camera. (laughs) - And I broke it too. (Louis and Shelly laugh) - Yeah. Yeah you did. - Hey. - Huh? - Let's kick some ass and get the fuck out of here. (Louis and Shelly laugh) - Yeah right. Let's get the fuck out of here. Come on, bro. Let's go. Come on. (crows cawing) (children singing) (people shouting) - [Louis] Shell. The amulet. (Louis shouts) - [Shelly] Hang on, hang on, hang on! Louis! - [Louis] Shelly! (Louis screams) (Shelly screams) - Where'd she go? (Louis screams) - [Louis] Come on, we're almost there! We're gonna make it! - [Shelly] Hey, Jackson. It's good to see you, man. We saw this tape. We thought you were dead, man. - Dead. Alive. Those have no meaning here. - [Louis] What's wrong with you, man? - [Shelly] Jackson, it's fucked up what happened to you, man, and everybody, but we got Maria's amulet. We got it from the room, man. We just need to get out that door. (Louis screams) - Are you rolling, Louis? - [Louis] What? (Louis screams) - Don't you wanna prove that something like me exists? - [Louis] Please, please just let us go, man. - I can be stabbed, hung, dragged, helpless, tortured, like Malia, like Elsa, like your bitch, Paige. - [Shelly] We didn't mean to do this. - [Louis] Stop fucking with us, Jackson! - No, Louis. I'm gonna show you the other side. Just like you wanted! (thudding) - Doyle, Doyle, you gotta wake up, man! You gotta wake up, you were right! We should not have gone in there! Everybody's dead! Everybody's dead! Come on, Doyle, you gotta. What are you doing? - [Doyle] What the hell? - Doyle! Doyle, what are you doing? Doyle! - What the hell? Whoa, shit. - [Louis] Doyle, don't go in there, they're gonna kill us! - Goddamn idiots. Nice day. I told them not to go in here. Hello? Hello? Anybody home? (door slams)
