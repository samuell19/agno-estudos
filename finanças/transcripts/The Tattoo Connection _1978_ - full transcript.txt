- Hey. What do you want? - Is that one eyed here? - Who the hell are you? You dare call our boss that. - You bums obviously don't know me. - Oh, I know you. You're one of Lu's men, the one they say can kick like a mule. - Well, if you know who I am, then that's the best you can come at. - Watch out. You're on our home ground now. - Where I am always belongs to me. - Well and maybe I'd like to find out if that's the truth. - Stop it, Lee Tung Hao, what do you want? - I want one of your men. - Who's that? - The one behind you. The Fat Dog. - I don't know him. - He's one of my men. Do you think I'd hand over one of my men to a member of another gang? - He used to be charge of keeping Mr. Lu's books but then he went missing with some money. And now, I must take him back with me. - All by yourself you won't? - I've always done things on my own. - Good, then let's see what you can do. All by yourself. If you can beat me, then he will go with you. - All right. - Tung Hao, I've lost, Fat Dog's no longer my man. You take him. - Fat dog, there's no where left to run. - Please, please, nothing to do with me. - What the hell have you done with all that money? - I lost it. Gambling, it's gone. - All right, that's enough now, we're going back. - Going back? But then I'll be killed. - No, you won't. I'll see to that. You're my responsibility. - On your knees. You've been treated well enough. You dare to lose money gambling after you've stolen it, you fool. Well then, what are we to do with you? You must be punished according to our rules. - Let's put him in a pig's cage. - And throw him in the sea. - Boss, no, anything, anything but that, no, no. Not to me, no. - Tung Hao, what's the meaning of this? - Mr. Lu, please spare his life. We've been together for a long time. I promised he would not be killed. Mr. Lu, he came willingly. - All right. I'll spare him this time. But our rules can't be broken. But then, you are left to punish him in any way that you see fit. - Get me the branding iron. Fat dog, your tattoo is now gone. From now on, you are not one of us. - Here they are. - Hi. - Hi there, George. I'm Micho, the bus is waiting for you up at the villa. - Good. - Keep up with him. - How much further? - Oh, about 10 more minutes. - Holding this briefcase is like carrying a timebomb. - It's all right. No one knows you're carrying diamonds. - I hope you're right. - Come in, come in, get ready to go. - Okay. - You okay? - Yeah, I'm all right. - That job couldn't have gone better. - You better be careful in covering our tracks up or we'll be in trouble. - Why? - Damn you, people know it's us. - There was a robbery at Kalu today shortly after 11 o'clock this morning. A Mercedes Benz traveling from the airport suddenly had path blocked by another vehicle. A briefcase... - Fancy getting your mouth around my sausage, huh? - Ah Min, eat it yourself. - The police say they have a few clues to go on, It is believed that several robbers were involved in the hold up. Some of them were reported armed with axes and knives. However, the police could not confirm this and we will try to get further news to you on the robbery in the late news. And that's all for now from the main news for this evening. - Ah Min. - Huh? - Those two cars. - It wasn't me. - Yes, it was. You were involved in that robbery. - Oh, woman. All I did was steal a couple of cars. I didn't know anything about that robbery there. - Who asked you to steal those cars? - I don't know. Some guy called Lu. Paid me $2,000 just to steal a couple of cars. - Then you're a fool. They made a lot while you're still a poor man. You better watch out the police don't get you. If they do, you'll be cuttered as a robber. - Hey, this will make front page. But not only the police will be after us. Some other guys will also be on your tails. You must stay hiding. No one must go out. Not even you. You must also wait to take our shares. - Yes, boss, when can we sell the diamond? - Mmm, our buyer is on his way from the states with cash. Tung Hao. - Yes, boss? What shall I do? - You got the diamond and don't you damn well lose it. - George. - Hi. - How are you? Have you thought of any new leads for us? While you've been lying here. - As I have told you many times before now, I am in hospital because of the robbery. You should be out there catching the thieves, not questioning me. - All right, you have a good rest and get better. - Hong Kong's a city of crime. - All right gentlemen, I've called this emergency meeting to pass on bad news. I've just heard from Hong Kong that the North Pole Star Diamond has been stolen. George is in hospital, but should be all right. As you know, the gem company was insured that diamond with us for over three million dollars. If it's not recovered by the end of the month, we stand to lose everything. All right, let's have suggestions. What steps can we take and let's map out a plan of action. - Have the Hong Kong police taken any action yet? - It's been reported to them but so far, they haven't a clue who did it. - I suggest we pay for its return. - That may work. But don't forget, we've paid out before, and it ended up with no results and losing even more. - Well, we must do something. - I've already planned some action, but it needs your approval. I agree, we offer a reward for information leading to it's recovery. But at the same time, I think we should send out our new operative to Hong Kong. This man was with the CIA in the far east for several years and he has an excellent record and now he's with the company. I think he's the right man for the job. - Where is this man? - Mr. Lucas? - Good morning. - Mr. Lucas, the board of directors have given their approval for you to take any action necessary for the recovery of the North Pole Star. - I've been known to be called a black six million dollar man. Hello, can I come in? - Lucas, well, what are you doing here so soon? - Don't forget, time is money. Well George, aren't you gonna ask me to come in? - Come on in. - By the way, how's the rib? - Oh, they're better now, it wasn't serious. - There's no more pain? - No, Lucas, I haven't got any information. How can I get back the diamond? - Take it easy. And you remember, you can do anything you want to, providing you're willing to learn and to go about things properly. - Right, but, well, neither of us is familiar with this place and where the hell are we to begin? - Just keep cool. I'll handle it. Don't worry. I have an old school mate who's with the Hong Kong police. There's a possibility. Maybe I'll get something out of him. - I just received the picture you sent me, but what is his name? - His name is Lucas. - Ah, Lucas is his name. Don't you worry, we'll take care of him. There's some bastard asking questions about the diamond. - Good evening. - I want you to keep an eye on him. Get rid of him if you have to. - Yes. - Hsiao Chen, wait here. I've got some business. How do you like the show? - Great. - Fantastic. - Not really, it's not really all fantastic. You can see much better back home in the states. - Mr. Lu, you're a humble person. I'll bet all of your staff are close cats. That's why our head office sent us out here to do business with a professional. - And since we know each other, how much can you offer? - 500,000 American dollars. - But don't you think that price is too low? - Your stone is too hot. It wouldn't be easy for us to sell it. - You know that it's worth three million bucks. Can you buy it? - Our highest offer is only 800,000. And that's as high as we'll go. You think about it. - No, thank you. It's far too low. - Well Mr. Lu, if you don't sell it to us, I'm afraid you won't be able to find another buyer. - Maybe so. But I can always give it to my fiance as a wedding present, she'll like it. Now you must excuse me, gentlemen, I have to go. - And now we have more news on the recent robbery at Clear Water Bay Road. We can now confirm that the valuable diamond, the North Pole Star, is missing. It was insured with an American insurance company for a sum which has not been disclosed. The company is now offering a reward of $100,000 to who can provide... - $100,000? That's more money than we'll ever make. - You're not kidding. We'll never see that kind of money. We ought to try and make some more out of our customers. - Over 30 people were made homeless, but they were given shelter by the social welfare department, no one was injured. - Good evening. - Good evening. - Here, sir. - Thank you. - Luisa? - Yes, sir? - You got me? - How are you very familiar with this place? - Oh, it's because of my job. - Luisa, Inspector Lu is here. - Oh, really? Inspector Lu? - Here's to our happiness and our success. Hi. - Inspector, I thought you'd forgotten me. - No way. I don't come here anymore. My boss will start wondering where I get my money from. - You're kidding. But manners. Must I stand? - Oh, come here. Let me introduce you. This man's name is George. - Hello, how are you? - Hello. - Now here's my old friend, Lucas. - Hello. - Hi. - And he's here to give us some money. - Oh, is that why you're really here? - Don't be agist, man, he's joking. - Luisa, you must have heard something about the recent diamond robbery. He's been sent by the insurance company. - Oh, so you're the man. - I thought we agreed not to talk business tonight, man. Hey you're good health. - Cheers. - Well now that we've finished our drinks, I think it's about time for you to introduce us to some ladies. - Oh yes, of course I'll find you some ladies. - You certainly don't believe in wasting much time. - Hey, George, diamonds are a girl's best friend. You should know that. - Hey, I'm in. Wake up, come on you lazy devil, wake up, come on, wake up. Haven't you been watching TV? - It's broken. Somebody's gotta fix it. - The insurance company's offering an award. Now's our chance. This time you'll be smart and we'll make some money. This time, we'll make some money. - No. - What did you say? - We won't get a chance to spend it. These aren't ordinary crooks. If we call that place, we're in big trouble. They're all murderers. - But how can they know it was you? - No, they'd find out, I'm sure of it. - The only thing wrong with you is you haven't got any damn guts. Okay, then you can hide here forever. - Luisa, what do you want with me? - Lucas, if I can supply some information about the diamond, will you pay me the $100,000? - If you can supply me the right information, the reward money will certainly go to you. - What information can you give us? - I have a friend called Ah Min who has some information about the diamond. - Where's he now? - Who you looking for? - You Ah Min? - What do you want? - I'm Lucas, your girlfriend sent me over here. - Whatever for? - The North Pole Star. - I don't know what the hell you're talking about, man. Maybe you came to the wrong place, huh. Let me go. - Are you trying to say you know nothing about it? - Please let me go. - If you tell me about the diamond, and help me find it, then have all the money you've ever wanted in your life, you hear? - You've only given me $3,000. I have to pay rent, everything, you think that's fair? - Well think about it. That's a lot of money. - I know nothing at all. - Well, if you won't cooperate, I'll hand you over to the police. It's your decision. Better decide. - This is your chance, the money's waiting for us. What are you afraid of? What's the matter? - All right. I will tell you. - I'm waiting. - Well, I don't really know that much. - What do you know? - I supplied the cars for them. I went out and stole two, that's it. I know nothing else. - Where'd you take 'em to? 5,000 here with me, if you can take me to the place where the diamond's being kept at, I'll give you the rest. - Come on, let's go. - You dare to betray us. You tell him, you tell him. - Ah Min, what did you tell that interfering? - I told him nothing, Mr. Lu. I told him nothing. - Oh, you won't tell me the truth? Well maybe car thieves enjoy being tortured. - Get up. - I'll tell you, boss. - Well, tell me. - I told him I got you the cars and nothing else, boss. Nothing else, boss. Why should I lie? - You're lying now. I wanna know why you went to the wood yard. - Chow Li. - Huh? - Where the hell are we going to? - To the ship. Quite near where we are now. - I have a feeling, a premonition about this diamond and it's not a good one. - Uncle, trust me. It's all right. Everything's okay. - I hope you're correct. - Wait. - Tung Hao, what are you doing? Tung Hao, if you want to survive, you have to be more ruthless. - Boss, our situations already bad, we shouldn't make it any worse. - How right you are. Your uncle's here? - Yes. - Ah. - This diamond's the best I've seen in my entire life. It's a true creation of God. - Old man, how many days? - It's perfect. Wonderful. - We know it's a damn good one. Your job is just to cut it. How long would you want to cut the damn thing? - At least 10 days. - That's too long. - Then seven. - All right. Seven days. I'll allow you. I'll send you a girl around, this is our custom. - No. I want three of them. - Huh, why is that? - I want you to send me three so that I can play my favorite game of mahjong. - You're really very young at heart, old man. I hope that three don't kill you. - What's wrong with you? Why didn't you tell me that you were coming over here? - Don't you know Ah Min's dead? - I know he is. Tung Hao, I'm tired of this kind of living. Can't we just leave here and go somewhere else? - There's no way out. The boss needs me. - You only think of your damn Mr. Lu. Don't you realize you're committing crimes and that it's wrong? One day you're going to be killed. - I would gladly die for that man. I was at one time an orphan. It's thanks to Mr. Lu I'm here. If it wasn't for him, I'd still be in the gutter, begging for what I could get. - What's the big difference between a beggar and a robber? One gets his money legally while the other does not. Don't you think you'll ever be punished for the things that you've done? Don't you ever stop and think about the woman who wants to be your wife? Tung Hao, I spend most of my time worrying about you. All right, you don't care if I can't sleep. Because I'm worried that you might get yourself killed, but don't come to me telling me how great Mr. Lu is. - No. - Don't touch me! I work in such a low class nightclub, fondled all the time by that man. I just can't take much more of this. I just can't. Please will you get me out of that damn place. I can't stand it, I can't stand it. I've made up my mind to leave that place. Tung Hao, didn't you say that you really love me? Well now you can prove it to me. All I ask is that you take me away. Please, promise me. - Is he dead? - Yes, sir. - How? - I would say he was beaten to death. There are wounds all over his body. There's no ID. - Wait. Lucas, take a look. Is he our man? - It's him. - Sir, have you come for tattoo? - Yes. - Good sir, we can do many types. Some plants, some animals, even some girls. Which do you like? - I'd like to see them. - Well have a look around. Sir, well, sir, which one do you like, which one do you like, huh? - I like none of these. I like this. - That's very unusual. It must be another place. - I've been all around Kalu and Hong Kong and they told me you are the greatest. But now I'm here, you don't welcome me. - I couldn't get the color in. Your skin is much too rough. You have to go somewhere else. If they can help you. - Do you know this man? - No, I've never seen him. - Hold it. I hope that you've been telling me the whole truth. There's no reason for you to worry. I know that you weren't involved in the murder. All I want is the truth. - Can you prove my innocence? - Yes. - I don't know this man. Miss Nana introduced him to me and he asked me for a tattoo on his arm. That was the first time I spoke to him. As it happens, it'll also be the last. - Nana. - Come in, sir. - Thank you. - Hey, Tung Yu, what's the black guy doing here? - Tell the boss. - Right. - Boss, the black guy is here. - Who? - That man's a danger. - Tell all my men. Be careful. - Sir. - Thank you. - That black guy, see him sitting over there? Well you keep your eyes on him. - Right. - Good. - Ladies and gentlemen, we are proud to present, the sexy dancing star of our show who is guaranteed to titillate you. How about a big warm welcome for our lovely lady, Miss Nana. - Waitress. - Yes, sir? - Could you ask Nana to come over to here? We're old friends. - Boss, it's all arranged. - Good. I want him killed as soon as he leaves. - Right, boss. - This gentleman was looking for you. - Please sit down. - I must say, I don't think I can handle you. Not at all. - There's an old Chinese proverb that says, "Strangers today, friends tomorrow." We'll get to know each other very soon. Miss Nana, what are you drinking? - Nothing. You have what you like, can put it on my bill. - That's one thing I really admire about you, Nana, that's your oriental nature. Shall we make friends? - Let me tell you, I don't want to. Because I don't know you and because you're black. - Miss Nana, Miss Nana. I'm Ah Min's friend, you should know him. - I don't know anyone with that name. - I hope you will remember. Hmmm. You bunch of murderers, if you don't wanna die, you better run away. You're gonna need all the help that you can get. - Stop it. Mr. Lucas, never in my life has I come up against a problem I couldn't solve. - Ah, that may be as maybe, but some problems just can't be solved. - We'll see just who can't solve what problem when he puts a little effort into it. - Your Chinese legs aren't bad. - I thank you. How does defeat taste? You're not so bad yourself. - That's about right. - Come on, the police are here, let's go. - Black man, you're lucky this time. - Yellow man, you won't get away the next time. - What are you doing here? - I'm just visiting. - No, you can't stay here. - Why not? Why every time that I come, do you tell me to go, huh? - I'm too busy to stand here talking to you. - You think you're too good for me? Well you're not and I'm the boss around here. You do what I tell you. When I call you, you must come to me. I don't want any of your excuses. You hear me? All right, stop crying. You're ruining the atmosphere. Come on, stop it. Stop it. Stop it, you hear me? - Why don't you ask me where I've just been out to? - I don't want to know. - Tung Hao. - Don't touch me. - You must think that I'm no better than a damn prostitute. I see that must be clearer. I'd asked you to take me away from that damn place so many times before. You must be gotten away from your precious Mr. Lu. Tung Hao, you'll regret this for the rest of your life. Your damn Mr. Lu. I hate him for what he is and what he's done to you. But you don't see that. - You shut up. - I can't stand him. - It's a dirty game but you are much dirtier. If you're not willing to stay here, no one will stop you from going your way. - You'd think that I'd be here willingly? You think that... - You slut. - I tell you he's not the man you thought he was. He's evil. He's a devil. I tell you I know what I'm saying. He only wants to use your talent. You're no better than a damn dog. You're no better than a dog. - Damn. - Hello. - Is that Lucas? - Hang on, I'll get him. It's for you. - Who is it? Yep. - You're Lucas? - Yes, who is this? Who are you? - I'm called Fat Dog. Have you lost the diamond? - You're right. Word spreads very quickly in Hong Kong. - I know that you still haven't found the diamond. So if you're still seeking it's return, bring 50,000. We'll meet at noon down by the sea. Now we'll meet near Cygon Ferry Pier at exactly 12 noon. Have you got that? Good. Look for my boat. - Hold on, who are you? - Lucas is meeting Fat Dog tomorrow at noon, somewhere near the Cygon Ferry Pier. - Tung Hao, as a result of your damn mercy, Fat Dog has contacted Lucas. - So, you're Fat Dog? - Yes. I wanna be friends. - Really? You come out here just to make friends? - I have some information. - Can I trust you? - Do you know who called the police the other night when you were surrounded? - So, you called the police. - Why, of course I did. - You'd know who they were? - Of course. One of them is responsible for these bandages. - Ah. - Ah, what are you doing? - I was just making sure you weren't lying to me. - I want 50,000 for all of my information. - Well, what kind of things can you tell me? - I can tell you who stole the diamond. How they did it and where the damn thing is now being hidden. - Fat Dog, I didn't bring well enough money. You tell me first and I'll pay you later, okay? - No. Your reward is $100,000. I only want half. I won't bargain anymore. Give me the money and I'll tell you. - All right, but when can I see you? - One o'clock, at the James Achua Ferry Pier. - Okay. - Huh? Fellas, why are you here? - Fat Dog, you asked for death instead of enjoying a long life? - Huh? What's that? What are you saying? - There's no use pretending. You see, we know what you've been up to. Come on, we're taking you to the boss. - Wait, don't you come near. Don't you make me want to kill you. - My god, it's 100% pure. I've never seen anything like it before. - Fung Yuen, do your work. - Uncle, how have you been getting on? - Splendidly. Look, I'm studying it's structure. When I know all there is to know, then I'll start. I must be very careful. It's so perfect. - Mr. Lu wants you to work much faster. You better hurry up. - He's an old man, you shouldn't try to ask him to work any harder. - Get out of here. - Hi, sit down. - Hi, look. - I already knew that. - He's another victim. Two people have been killed because of that diamond. The police don't even know a damn thing of what the hell is happening. - Old friend, so you expect us to make progress reports to your company? - Your police department moves as slow as a snail. That's why the crime rate's so high. - The rate is still really quite low in comparison with the states. - All right, Bobby. But I really want your help. All I want, Bobby, is your full cooperation. That's all. - We are trying our best. We're using all our available man power. We have come up with one small clue. There's a jewelry shop in Talu. A famous diamond cutter's gone missing. I think that, well I feel that, if we could only somehow find that old man, then we would find the diamond. But then you can never be sure. - Thanks for the information. Now I'm gonna be getting back to my room. - A moment. Don't you go getting emotional. - Beautiful. Another one. Tonight, we're having a delicacy. Rabbit stew. - Huh? You put them down. Ta Niu, Ta Niu. Ta Niu, you leave them alone. - Damn it, you always give us canned food. So why don't we eat one? - You think this is the QE2? Where the hell do you think that you are? - How do you dare to provoke me? - Ta Niu, I'm gonna kill you. - Ta Niu, stop it! - It's none of your business. - Let's go in. - Mmm. - That's a good move. I'm stuck. - You could move your knight there. - You're right. Your move. - Check. - I think you've got me this time. - You could move with your bishop. - Ah, I see. That's a fantastic move. But George, it looks like you're playing both sides of the fence. - What do you mean? - It seems that you've already arranged all of my moves for me. I'm always the loser. That's why I must change it. Check mate. - George, you shouldn't have come here, it's dangerous. - There's no other way I can be sure of absolute privacy. - Follow me. Take a seat. Let's have a drink first. What'll it be, huh? - Mr. Lu, the situation has turned very sour on us. Do you still wanna have a drink? - We Chinese have a saying. "While you still have life, make the most of it." George, I think we should toast our cooperation. - Since our little cooperation, I've received nothing. You promised me one third of the diamond's value. - You're right. I did promise you. But that Lucas, he's causing so much trouble. - The black man should have never been allowed to get this far in the first place. I can't stay any longer, I must get away. All I want is 500,000 Hong Kong dollars. The rest is yours. - My friend, I'm afraid I don't carry that much cash with me. - That's your business. All I want is the money. If things go wrong with your end of the deal, I'm not gonna be responsible for it. - All right. You'll have your money tomorrow. I hope that's to your satisfaction. Please. - All right, I'll wait one more day. Goodbye. - Goodbye. You two, make sure he gets back. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Mr. Lu, I don't think we should be doing this. - Tung Hao, why do you always treat me like a little boy? Why do you do it? In this world, if you don't stop the wars, the others will. You should at least know that fact. Think about it. - Where are you taking me? - What? - To a place so far away. - Mr. Lu, Lucas has already met her. How can we let her go? - She's going because Lucas knows her. All right, my friend. - Why do you think he's so stupid? - He'll do anything at all to find us. Otherwise, he's failed. And he's the kind of man who, like me, cannot tolerate failure. - Boss, I will go. Just tell me whatever you'd like me to do. - Huh? - This is one of the latest drugs from the states. When a man takes this drug, he'll become excited. His heart will beat faster and faster until he cannot control it and then he will die in the end. Nana, you get Lucas excited and then, let him die in complete happiness. - For our lives' sakes, I'm willing to do this just once. - Good, good girl. You'll be rewarded. The moment that I have that stone, you'll have all that you've ever wanted. Tung Hao, wake up. Go tell your uncle to start cutting. - No, I don't want this one. But there's more and I don't know what it's called. It helps you to give up smoking. - I'm sorry lady, but we don't stock that stuff. - Hello, Nana. What are you doing here all by yourself? - Ah, so it's you. - The last time we met at the night club, you didn't seem to be all that friendly towards me. Why don't we start again over a quiet drink? I hope you'll have that drink with me. I hope that we can be friends. - If you want to go and have a drink, I'd certainly like that. Why don't we go now, mmm? - That's beautiful. Let's go then. Over there. - Is that right, sir? Thank you. She's a pretty girl. - Yes, she is beautiful. - Lucas, why did you come to stay in Hong Kong? - You don't know then, what I'm doing here? Ah, excuse me. - What are you going to do with all those eggs? - Oh, this is a special prescription. - Special? - Mmm. Nana, you're so very pretty. Your hair is so beautiful. - Let's drink to each other. - Here's to you. Hang in there, all right? This is the best protein for you to improve your sexual drive. - Will you stop it then? We're singing. I want you to stop it. - Why don't you make all of us stop it? - Bet you can't. - I'll finish with all of you later. - I feel so hot. My heart is beating so much. - I think you've drunk too much. - Oh no, I've only drunk a little. - Bet you know, I know what the reason is. - What's the reason? - Nana, you have a fine sexy, young black man. I think you're a very sexy young lady, you follow? That's why you're so nervous. - Well my friend, to pay for the drinks, I think I'll put on a special performance just for you. Come on. - No, my drink hasn't stimulated me yet. - Mr., who are you looking for? - That guy in room nine. I know he's down there. - Well, he's just gone out. You can't go in there. - Hmmm. Open it. - I will if you pay. - Oh my friend, who are you looking for? - Nana. - Nana, we're going home. - She's really loaded but I promise you, me and her never really got it on. She's all yours, baby. - You damn... - Hold on a minute, will you wait? Now then, this is a high class joint. No place for fighting. In front of all those people. - Bye. - Get back, come on. - You were supposed to watch the diamond cutter. What the hell have you been doing? Is it because of that? You think you can hide anything from me? I already knew you two were together. If you love her, why the hell didn't you come and tell me, huh? I would have given her to you. I couldn't care less. There's no need to sneak around in the dark. All right, I'll give you just one more chance. I'll have to kill that black guy. If I want to ever be able to sell the diamond. I passed on the information to all the jewelry shops. But if that black guy comes looking, they'll send him here, and we'll be waiting. Tung Hao, try and kill him. - But if I kill the black guy, can I take her away with me? - All right. It's a deal. - So we meet again, then. One against many again. - Heya! - Take him away. Hsiao Chen, bring me the diamond right now. - Have you finished, old man? - You know nothing about diamonds. It takes time to cut one. - All right, I'm stupid. Now shut up and give it to me. - What did you say? - Come on, give it to me. Give it to me. Come on. Damn. - What the hell? Why you swallow it? - Spit it out, old man. Spit it out. - Where are you going? What? You want to leave? - Mr. Lu, you said that we could go. You promised us. - Boss, what do you think you're doing? - Precisely what I mean is that no one is ever allowed to leave here. - But boss, you promised us. You promised we could leave. - You know all about me. You leave over my dead body. - I'm gonna leave. I'll leave with Nana, then we'll forget about the past. - Even if I let you go right now, you think the police will be so kind as to let you walk right out of this mess? - We're going. Nana, go. - Hey, hey. Come quickly, the boss wants you, he's fighting Tung Hao. - Who will guard the black guy then, huh? - Oh it's all right, I'll take care of him. - Let's go. - Hurry. - Hurry up, come on quickly. - Spit it out, spit it out, spit it out. - They're fighting up there. Come on. Old man, you stay here. - I'm very glad because the best thing to come out of all of this is that, we have become friends. - You're right. I'll be going to the states in two years if I'm lucky. - You may be free in a year in a half if you behave yourself well. All right, then he'll be able to see you at Christmas. - Then I'm looking forward to seeing you at Christmas.
