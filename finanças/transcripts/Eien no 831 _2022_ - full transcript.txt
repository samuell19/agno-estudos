{\fnArial\3c&HFFFFFF&\1c&HFF0&\fs15\b1\an0} Subtitle Extraction from : Shahid {\fnArial\3c&HFFFFFF&\1c&FF0000&\fs20\b1\an0} Edit sync By : D.LUFFY My name is Suzushiro Asano. It was the year the world was in turmoil following an unprecedented disaster. Like so many others, I was also in extreme financial and emotional distress. I only managed to make it to Tokyo because of a newspaper scholarship and a single-minded desire to escape "stopped time." 'Morning. Oh, good morning. You're new, aren't you? Student? Yes. College kids doing paper routes are a rare sight these days. But school hasn't started yet, right? Shouldn't you still be at home with your parents? No, I wanted to get away as soon as possible. Get away? Where is there to get away to after the disaster? I know... Are you okay? Yes... I'm fine. Be careful. Yes... Last summer, a classmate committed suicide because of me. Ever since that day, I've been wandering all alone in "stopped time," unable to share my pain with even my family. That is, until I met her... a person who endured a similar, or even worse, experience than I went through. ETERNAL 831 WEBVTT	#Elemental Media Engine(TM) 2.17.1.0 Well done. You finished by seven. Yes...just barely. You got this far in a week. You're doing pretty good. Thank you. Go get some breakfast. Okay. Hi, guys. Good morning! - Good job. - Good work. Suzushiro! I hear you can do the route on your own now. Come sit here. Thank you. Sugoroku has been on a newspaper scholarship for eight years and is my senpai at Teio University where he will graduate this spring. Tea, Suzushiro? Thanks. I'll get it myself. You're so nice to youngsters, Belle. I can't have students think news vendors don't treat their people well. Take your time. School hasn't started yet, has it? No. This fetching woman who everyone affectionately calls "Belle" is Akina, the store manager and only daughter of the shop's owner who I heard died two years ago. They say the economy is looking up. Don't they know how many more people can't even afford the newspaper? The government can go to hell. The way things are going, it makes no difference if the prime minister's from the opposing party or a woman. Outbursts like that make you sound like a menopausal old man. Didn't Father tell you that news vendors are journalists on the front line? Now shape up. Don't you start now, Belle. Belle's escapades during her college days kept the late boss's hands full. Hey, enough! What do you think, Suzushiro? As a young man who has to live through the unprecedented disaster. I...hadn't really thought about it. It was, after all, the worst thing to happen to postwar Japan. The pros who run the country can't do a thing to fix it. Nothing people like us say will make any difference. You lucky students have it easy. Suzushiro... Before school starts, you should get to know which customers are deadbeats. Shall I make the rounds with you? I'd appreciate that. It's the same as the morning delivery. Press 4 - 2 - 8 - 1 - 3 - 2. That's the code for paper delivery. If you ring them from here, they'll always pretend they're not home. I'll wait for you here, so give it a try. What?! Okay... I'm from Toto Shimbun. I'm here to collect. What do you want? You interrupted my work. You owe three months' subscription. Huh?! You're not the same guy who signed me up. About that... There's a lot I don't like about your paper, so I'm not paying. Huh?! Wait! Just a minute! So you do read it, right? Wait here. You can have all these back! No! Newspapers are information. You can't just return them after you read them. Nowadays, if a consumer isn't satisfied, it's understood that he can return it. No, that's not how it works. Take them and get out of here! WEBVTT	#Elemental Media Engine(TM) 2.17.1.0 Take them and get out of here! Uh-oh... It's been a while. Everything stopped. How long will it be this time? This is "stopped time." This state is usually triggered when I'm angered by injustice. When it happens, I have no sense of how long time has stopped. The first time it happened, I think it lasted about three minutes. After that, when the parents of my classmate who committed suicide and students at my school came after me, time often stopped for a week or more. That gives me an idea... He's a smoker... Oh... It's not the best plan, but if it helps calm me down... it might be the way to go. How'd collection go, Suzushiro? Good man, Suzushiro! I nearly had to force that guy to buy a subscription, so I was certain he wouldn't pay. Huh...? That was the moment I discovered how to start and stop time since I began wandering through frozen time. So, I want everyone to read it. As for the section on student life... There are still open places, right? I think so. How about there? Oh... Asano, the two of us are thinking about going for a drink. Want to come? Sorry. I have work. Aside from your part-time job? Yeah. Okay, maybe next time. See you. - Say, Muroto. - Yeah? What's a way to cut onions without crying? Well... Welcome back. - Oh, Suzushiro! - Have you got the hang of it? Yeah, getting there. Oddly, there was no complaint call from the man I went to collect from the other day. Go upstairs. There's lots to eat, so go help yourself. Okay. What? Hamburgers? You once said you like pot stickers... Even though time had stopped, it wouldn't have been odd to question if I had gone into his residence. But there was no trouble aside from his cancelling his subscription. Damn it! Perhaps he felt guilty about not paying his newspaper bill. When people are aware they're doing something wrong, they show more anger than necessary when someone points it out to them. WEBVTT	#Elemental Media Engine(TM) 2.17.1.0 Could you... please pay for your subscription? I told you not to come during business hours! But I'm afraid I can only come to collect when you're open. Well, it's your job to collect regardless. You're right. I'll come again. Still not angry enough... Hello! Evening edition delivery. Excuse me. Along with your evening paper, could you please pay your ten years of unpaid subscriptions? Oh, you're new, aren't you? I'm with a guest now, so mind coming around back? For the past ten years, this household has subscribed to several papers, but efforts to collect payment have mostly failed. They're stubborn deadbeats. Just who the hell do you think you are?! You embarrassed me in front of my guest! I served as a member of the Tokyo Assembly for ten years! Companies gladly bring their papers to me to read for free! You're the first person who's had the gall to ask me to pay! What paper are you...?! He kept every one of his past invoices... I felt like a thief, but if I looked at it as recouping what the shop was long due, I felt like I was doing justice. Was she...looking for me? WEBVTT	#Elemental Media Engine(TM) 2.17.1.0 How was she able to move? I need to get angry all over again. That kid! This is going to get me yelled at. Hi. I'm sorry. It got a little wet. That's okay. I was expecting you. Here you go. What's this? This month's payment. Thanks for all you do. You've subscribed to our paper for years. Why haven't you switched to direct payment from your bank account? Direct payments are simpler, but then, I can't thank you like this, can I? Take this with you, too. Here. Thank you very much. Thank you. Oh, thanks. Another good day to deliver news, guys! Good morning. Oh, 'morning. Guys! Look at this! This hasn't made the TV news yet! Hey, hey! Haven't seen a scoop like this in more than a decade! Oh! There's nothing about it. If the attack at the prime minister's residence happened at night, and they just managed to send it to the presses, then it happened at 1:00 a.m. Not even the internet news has this story. - That's awesome! - Awright! Everyone! Get these delivered ASAP! WEBVTT	#Elemental Media Engine(TM) 2.17.1.0 'Morning. Good morning. Did something happen? You're lucky you have it easy, Belle. 831 Front declares war?! "Anti-Government Group Sends Threat to PM's Official Residence." "Hints at Kidnapping Hughminicc's Matsunaga..." Let me see... "To the people who run Japan, 'the country where time stopped...'" The country where time stopped... Enjoy it, Suzushiro! On my way. - Be careful! - Bye! The country where time stopped... Look... Oh that. Yeah, I saw it. Read on. - A threat? - Yup. That's scary. A kidnap threat. This isn't fake. I'll explain, so read on. This is scary. Disasters, terror attacks... Enough already. We're not in the Showa Era! No, that's not what the Summer Breakers are. I have high hopes for them. Just who are the Summer Breakers? I'll explain from the start. There are many ways to interpret it... There was quite a bit on the Net, before the media picked it up. We have learned that an anti-government group calling itself the 831 Front has warned of acts of terrorism against the Japanese government. The terms "Summer Breakers" or "831"... It's exactly that. People thought these guys are crazy... But then, they took on this hero aura. I get it now. So they like... They punish the powerful to save the poor. - Yes, yes. Cool. - They're saviors. Cool, right? And they intend to act. You think they will? Terrorists trying to end summer vacation, ergo "Summer Breakers"... Is there someone else who can also stop time?! Could that girl also...? How long will time stay stopped? It worked! WEBVTT	#Elemental Media Engine(TM) 2.17.1.0 The uniform! Wireless isn't working, so I can't use the internet. I'm back. - Hey. - Welcome back. How was school? Cancelled. Oh... Because more people died... An all-girl school in Shibuya... That's nowhere near here... What was she doing there? Hey! The 831 Front effing did it! This is breaking news. Tomiyo Matsunaga, chairman of the board of the staffing firm Hughminicc Group, has been kidnapped. We repeat. - Here. - This is getting interesting. Tomiyo Matsunaga, has been kidnapped. The incident follows on the heels of a threat delivered earlier this morning to the Prime Minister's residence. Police believe anarchists calling themselves the 831 Front are responsible and are investigating their connection to the incident. At Hughminicc headquarters, the site of the incident, the driver of the car carrying Matsunaga says he stopped on the roadside in front of the building, but when he opened the back door, he realized that Matsunaga was not there. In response to the kidnapping threat, the scene was heavily guarded by police officers and Hughminicc employees, but there were no witnesses... The 831 Front used "stopped time" to commit that crime. She's not here, after all. What good would it do to look for her? Back then, too, if I had kept quiet to the school about the stolen student council funds, nothing would have happened... Huh?! Hello? Where am I? Just... looking for something. Uh-huh, okay... What? Again? Right now? WEBVTT	#Elemental Media Engine(TM) 2.17.1.0 That girl has definitely been looking for me. What now? Number 2 headed for Shinjuku-Shibuya will arrive shortly. For your safety, please stand behind the yellow line. Takada-no-baba. Takada-no-baba. Thank you riding the train. Number 2 doors will close. Please be careful. Next stop: Shin-Okubo. Please disembark from the right. Please silence your cell phones while you are on board. Thank you for your cooperation. Maybe this isn't a good idea... Why, Asano?! Why did you tell the teacher before coming to me first? Miyamae is about to go to Nationals. The student council won't need the funds for a while, and after the match, the money for cleats and uniform was going to be... Even if you intended to return the money, those funds were collected from the student body. Miyamae has no right to it. Look, I know that! But if we had kept silent, it wouldn't have been an issue! Hearing Shinohara shouting in tears, I realized for the first time that she and Miyamae were seeing each other. You tried, Shinohara... I'll give up going to Nationals. But...you worked so hard for this! Asano... What made you want to be so righteous that you'd ruin a life for it? I was only... I bet you're feeling pretty good about yourself. You think you beat us by doing the right thing. Shinohara took the student council presidency from you, so this is your way of getting back. That was never my intention! You're misusing justice... and you're going to pay for it. I'm not letting you win. And then, it happened... August 31. Miyamae called the police and told them I stole the money and then, he jumped off the roof. Shibuya. Thank you for riding the train. Please be careful when you step onto the platform. Number 2 doors are closing. I'm in... Eighth floor... WEBVTT	#Elemental Media Engine(TM) 2.17.1.0 Huh? Oh, a newspaper guy... We don't want a newspaper. No loitering! Huh? Did time just... stop? It was her. Forgive me, Nazuna. This should be moving, but... Eighth floor... It's that newspaper guy. Don't touch him. He'll start to move. This time, it might not be stopped for very long. Let's hurry. Gotcha. That was close... But...how're they able to...? Are you...all right? You're that newspaper guy... How did you...? So you did see me! I realized that there was someone other than me who could stop time. WEBVTT	#Elemental Media Engine(TM) 2.17.1.0 I realized that there was someone other than me who could stop time. I thought maybe you were the one, so I followed you. You were looking for me then, weren't you? I thought maybe there was someone else too... I think it was about a year ago... when I first became aware of time being frozen that was not my doing. I've been looking for you ever since. One year ago was probably me. How long have you...? Since the first year of junior high... so five years. That long? But I only noticed your time stoppage recently. That's because I hadn't done it for nearly a year. Before that, you had probably stopped, as well. You just never noticed. I see... Sorry! I'm Suzushiro Asano. I came to Tokyo this spring. I'm Nazuna Hashimoto. By the way, who were those people earlier? And what's with this gun? What was it that made you able to stop time? For me, it's usually "anger." For me... it's "death." Death?! Then is this...? Don't! If you touch it, your intervention will cause huge trouble. Did one of them...? The one who fired it... was my older brother. My brother and his friends are the rogue group calling themselves the 831 Front. What?! Can they stop time, too? Then how are they able to move? My brother was there at the moment of my death and he's been able to move ever since. As for the others, they can move if I intervene. Can your brother move during time that I stop? I don't know... I think he probably can't. Let's run away from here together! Where will we run away to? This is my home. My brother is the only one I can depend on. I don't know what's going on, but I would never point a gun at my own sister and use her to commit a crime. You mustn't stay with a person like that! Stop it! Please! Please stop it! Gramps? It's me, Yuki. WEBVTT	#Elemental Media Engine(TM) 2.17.1.0 Gramps? It's me, Yuki. Hello? Grandma? It's me. It's me! Oh, Grandma... Right. It's me, Hiro. I'm in a bit of a jam. Yes, regarding your credit card... Yes, the credit card you use. Yes, a foreign purchase was made on that credit card. I used company money. I'm calling to check if you bought anything... My phone's gone... My wallet, too. I did a stupid thing. I know that. At this rate, your money will be... They said they'll tell my company if I don't pay. One million yen. I need to know your bank account number by today. Can you lend me some money? I don't know what to do?! Yes. I swear I'll never do it again! Yes, if I can have the number by today. Uh... I'll be fired or even arrested! Am I in some kind of scammers den? You're the new guy, right? Better get working if you don't want to get in trouble. If you can't pay... Isn't what you're doing wrong?! 300,000 would help. Hey... Working hard? - Hello. - Hello. You... Come with me. Get in. Yo, Suzushiro. Sleep well? I hear you were good to Nazuna yesterday. Thanks. You sure about giving back his phone? If he tries to run, we can track him. "Suzu" as in "pure" and "shiro" as in "white." It's a name I feel a connection with. I'm Seri Agawa. How do you do? Seri... Nazuna... Like the seven herbs of spring... Student body vice president at a prep school in Utsunomiya. Top five in your class. Ran track in junior high. Placed third in the prefecture. Considered a prodigy until junior high? In high school, I was called the picture of mediocrity. I like you a lot though. What I'm trying to do, you've already done. I checked up on you. I'm sorry to hear that your parents had to close down their real estate agency, but let me praise you on behalf of your late father. What you did wasn't wrong. You did the right thing. Nazuna and I went through a similar experience. I'm going to make the people who hurt her pay for what they did. Is this about claiming responsibility and the kidnapping? I don't know your circumstances, WEBVTT	#Elemental Media Engine(TM) 2.17.1.0 but I feel like I understand. But why do you do it that way?! Each time you force her to stop time, she has to feel the fear of death all over again! You're right... - That's what I like about you. - What? You can stop time too, right? We've had lots of students quit without a word, but Suzushiro was getting the hang of it. There were no signs that he was going to give up. Suzushiro's bicycle was abandoned near the intersection at 7-chome. What should we do? Call the police? Let's contact just the school and see what happens. I'll have Sugoroku do his deliveries. What?! Thanks. All right. The "831 Front," believed to be behind the series of kidnappings, has issued demands to the government for ransom, including an end to the casino construction project. Did this happen when time stopped yesterday? Yeah. We're kidnapping this guy next. Why? Who cares, Suzushiro? Do your thing and stop time. No, that's going to be a problem... What? I can't stop time until I become extremely angry. Huh? Then get angry. Anger isn't something that happens in a situation like this. Then I'll pound you until you do. No, I'm not a fighterâ€” I'd just give up. You're right. It won't be easy to make you angry enough to stop time. He's useless... Donki! What? Wait a minute! If you're willing to go that far, I'll stop time for you. Chill. Donki won't get caught. He's not the one I'm worried about. He was abused by his parents from the day he was born. Probably treated worse than a dog waiting to be put down. Child protective services turned a blind eye. Then, when he was twelve, he killed his parents with a blunt object. Suzushiro... I'm glad you're okay! Where's my brother? After they took you, I was so worried about you. I thought something might happen to me too, but for some reason, your brother took a liking to me, so I'm still alive. I think my brother likes you because he learned you can stop time. WEBVTT	#Elemental Media Engine(TM) 2.17.1.0 You need to get away before he takes advantage of you! As much as I want to run away, I don't know if it's because he trusts me, or because he sees right through me, but he told me to come alone to see you. I want you to tell me your story. I know it'll be hard for you, but tell me, so that I can stop time in your place. My father was remarried to my mother. He was over 60 at the time and worked for the Ministry of Finance. As I recall, it was the year the consumption tax was being debated. As part of his duties, he would appear on television. But at home, he was constantly troubled. He fell ill and missed a lot of work. That day... my father was feeling sick since morning. I was worried and came home earlier than usual. Dad? Nazuna! Nazuna! Breathe, Nazuna! At first, my brother and I didn't realize that time had stopped. Breathe. My brother and I lived apart, but he happened to come by after receiving a silent call from our father. Do you know who he is? Dad... Time has stopped. Nazuna! Get away from her! Who was that man? I don't know. WEBVTT	#Elemental Media Engine(TM) 2.17.1.0 I told the police about him, but they said I was hallucinating from the shock of seeing my father die. My brother didn't make any statement about the man. My father's death was ruled a suicide and widely reported on the news. They labeled him a crook who forced the consumption tax hike through. Every day, we received phone calls and e-mail blaming him for it. I think I remember that incident... A finance official pushing for the tax increase killing himself out of remorse. Nazuna... This next one will be... the last time you stop time. Good work. This is breaking news. Economic analyst Masayuki Kishimoto was the victim of an attack. Due to the weapon having a trick blade, Kishimoto did not suffer any injuries. The youth in the attack escaped and still has not been found. Mr. Agawa... Who is it that you're fighting? The people who have brought this country to a standstill and have no intention of moving ahead. Do you have any idea who runs this country's agenda? The people, I think. I see. But the government of this country is comprised of special interest groups that have nothing to do with the good of the people. They aren't based in ideology or political philosophy, but on market fundamentalism. They don't help victims and the needy during a great disaster like this because they want to believe that the people will return to prosperity even if they cut off welfare. Want to believe? They fatten their pockets by cutting welfare and social security and applying it to foreign investments and tax breaks for the wealthy, and turn a blind eye to the fact that they are working hard to build a system in which people left behind by the economy have to work like slaves. The reason the great disaster forced your father to hang himself was because of the social structure those people created. What we really need to confront is the defeated-nation status that has created a harsh, exploitative structure that invalidates the very right to life; the thorough brainwashing that makes us forget we are a sovereign nation; the media that deprives us of normal thought; the colonialism exploited by trade agreements; and the irresponsible minions that happily accept the totalitarianism, who think that summer vacation will never end. Now you will be taking the fight to them as well. Shinohara... It's your fault! WEBVTT	#Elemental Media Engine(TM) 2.17.1.0 It's your fault! What'll you do?! Miyamae is dead! You're the one who should have died! Bring him back! Bring him back! That's not what happened! I didn't do it! Listen to me! It wasn't me! He... Wait! I'm telling you I didn't do it... Listen to me! When my father died... somehow... I couldn't cry... The anger comes afterwards, doesn't it? In that moment, you don't know what happened. But for some reason, it wells up in you after time has passed. Oh, wow... She's not here. Come with me. She's here, Mr. Agawa. She's... This has got to be a first. The Prime Minister kidnapped stark naked from her house! WEBVTT	#Elemental Media Engine(TM) 2.17.1.0 The Prime Minister kidnapped stark naked from her house! No funny stuff. Treat her with respect. Gotcha. Hey... Don't lose concentration and let time start moving again. - Sorry for the intrusion. - What ?! Who are you?! Stop this! Let go of me! Stop! - Who do you think I am?! - Yeah, sure. I had a feeling...I would be next. But I'm surprised you came personally, Mr. Agawa. I'm impressed you got this far. How'd you get inside? I used special means. I can't even imagine what that might be, but it's the most brazen so far. That's because a Hollywood-style crime is the quickest way to achieve the drastic reform of the social structure we want from you people. I see... So... what do you want me to do? For now, we'll demand a ransom of 10 trillion yen from the government. The money is to be for distributing aid to impoverished citizens. The government will have no intention of complying with our demands, of course, so they will announce a 10-trillion yen stimulus package in lieu of the ransom. So until then, I'll be a prisoner somewhere? Yes. About how many days does it take for the cabinet to make a decision in the absence of the prime minister? Since it's an emergency situation, it shouldn't take long. Five days at most. That's long. You're not taking me like this, are you? I don't know where you're taking me, but at least let me get dressed. You'll be plenty comfortable just as you are. Think about what the press will say! Do you want to humiliate me? Is this payback for five years ago? Catching you in the bath was purely a coincidence. You're the girl from that day, aren't you? Nice... Yours? No, it's a rental. Because I can't write it off. WEBVTT	#Elemental Media Engine(TM) 2.17.1.0 Suzushiro... Come. After you... One of my people will let me know when the Cabinet authorizes the stimulus. You'll be free to go then. What happened to the two you kidnapped before me? Are they here, too? Who's to say? But we have finished short selling the related corporations, so... They'll be released tomorrow. I see... Then the Finance Ministry will have a busy day tomorrow. I will... enjoy my time off to the fullest. Mr. Agawa... The enemy you talked about... She's not the one, is she? Wrong. Five years ago, when my father had to die alone, she was the finance minister at the time and to me and Nazuna, definitely the enemy. But that talk about short selling... You and your people had ties to the government from the start, didn't you? It's hard to fight with people you don't know at all. That might be true, but I don't understand at all. Tell me what's going on! I don't feel that much anger towards that person. In fact, I'm beginning to distrust you, Mr. Agawa. What was the real reason your father had to die? Who was moving this country at that time? I think you already know. If you really don't know... it's not because you don't know... it's because you don't want to know. You're free to go, too. You did good work in Nazuna's place. I appreciate it. See you. Let's go. Drive. Suzushiro... Suzushiro came back! Where have you been all this time? I'm sorry, Miss Akina. How many delivery days have I missed? Days? - Hey, wait! Suzushiro! - Suzushiro, what's wrong? Pull yourself together! - Suzushiro, hey! - Suzushiro?! Hey! Are you okay?! Suzushiro! Suzushiro! After the incident, there was a huge uproar. The Hollywood-style crimes in the wake of the great disaster created a buzz that lasted about three months as the hunt for the kidnappers continued. In this way, the collection or group that is formed... becomes known as a unit. WEBVTT	#Elemental Media Engine(TM) 2.17.1.0 becomes known as a unit. Just as Agawa said, the ransom for the prime minister was approved by the budget committee in the form of about four trillion yen in aid to the citizens which quickly disappeared somewhere. The Prime Minister is nothing but the victim here. You all read the statement she gave to the police. Perhaps it was channeled into the stock market and led to the surge in stock prices that followed. The media reported that the economy was recovering, but Sugoroku could not even find a job and people continued to default on their subscription payments. Oh... It's been a while. How have you been? Here. Thank you. For you... Thank you. Go ahead and eat. I will. See you again. Do your best. In my spare time, I scoured the Internet to find out more about Nazuna and Agawa. After the disaster of five years ago, when the priority was rescuing victims, the consumption tax was increased to raise funds for reconstruction. The people had no choice but to accept it as long as it was for reconstruction. However, certain opposition party members raised suspicions that all of the additional tax revenue was used to pay the U.S. military which had assisted in the rescue efforts. As the people lost faith in the Cabinet and rumors began to surface about subpoenaing witnesses and a Finance Ministry official, who was in a position to know the truth, committed suicide. His motive was attributed to remorse over the tax increase. While it seemed unlikely to appease the public, the opposition party members stopped pursuing the matter any further. I was still in my second year of junior high at the time and did not understand what the incident meant. Agawa's mother had passed away, but Nazuna's mother died in the Great East Japan Earthquake. Nazuna's father, Teruyoshi Agawa, a Finance Ministry official at the time, felt the people could not afford both a reconstruction and consumption tax and stubbornly opposed a tax hike that would not be used for reconstruction. He attempted to stop the bill, but the public became convinced that the bill originated with him and began bashing him, and even his family, on the internet. The minister of finance at the time was the current prime minister, Kyoko Kagami. You can find everything on the internet... In light of Nazuna's story, Vice Minister of Finance Agawa was set up to be the fall guy and then murdered to make it look like suicide. Agawa was notorious enough as a rogue malcontent to appear on the internet, but his source of funds and connections to the entertainment industry WEBVTT	#Elemental Media Engine(TM) 2.17.1.0 and connections to the entertainment industry still left many questions. As I see it, Agawa was connected in some way to the man who appeared at his father's suicide. Comparing stock price movements of the staffing and IR-related companies with the dates of the kidnappings and subsequent release of the hostage as well as the dates of bills passing in the Diet, it became very clear that stock prices began to soar due to repeated short selling and buying. While it could be said that Agawa achieved a personal vendetta for Nazuna, it'd be difficult to say he carried out his battle against the people he told me about who brought the country to a standstill. Prime Minister, don't you owe the people an explanation about your connection to the perpetrator? The Prime Minister became the topic of scandals, but continues to hold her position without much shame. Hurry! When all is said and done, Agawa used me. Since then, I've been wandering about an unending, eternal August 31. Who should I fight, and how? Tell me, Mr. Agawa... "Those who live August 31 eternally..." They might make me disappear as well... Excuse me. I'm looking for Suzushiro Asano. That would be me. Package for you. I'll need your stamp or a signature. Thank you! Who could it be from? Seri Agawa?! "Your reward." "End August 31 yourself." WEBVTT	#Elemental Media Engine(TM) 2.17.1.0 A foolish life or a noble death? He's saying it's my choice... He knows me too well... After time stopped... Were you waiting here for me all this time? Yes... Where's Agawa? He went off somewhere before time stopped. To end August 31? Who knows? I want to start up time again on my own terms... with you. I'd like that. WEBVTT	#Elemental Media Engine(TM) 2.17.1.0
