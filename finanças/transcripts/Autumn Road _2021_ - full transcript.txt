Tell me, if you remember with some tender sentiment the first time you looked out a dark window and wondered what could be looking back at you. If you remember the heartbreak you felt when you first learned that life and love were fragile things. If you've ever been enchanted by the night. And if in addition to experiencing one of these priceless sensations, you carry around a chill in your bones that you've never quite been able to shake, turn around now, for this may be too much for you. For behind these doors is the home to those very same dark delights. Then I take their ticket, and I'll let them in. Do you have to say that every time? You don't have to, but it helps set the mood for the guests. See, haunting is all about setting the right tone. What's that? It's a feeling. That's right. A strong feeling. A feeling you can almost touch. I like scary stuff. I like scary stuff, too. Scary stuff can be fun, and it's good for you. Where's Charlie? That's a good question. Vince, where's your brother? Hey, buddy. - Ready to go trick or treating? - I'm okay. We need to go early if we wanna get back in time for the house. I don't wanna help out with the house this year. Okay. But you know your friend Winnie's here, and I think she's waiting for you. - She's not my friend. - Really? No. Vincent likes her. He told me to stay away. Now, he's not the boss of you. You know that, right? Okay. We'll be back soon. If you can't be good, don't be stupid. Scoot in a little bit closer. Perfect. Trick or treat! You two are early. I wasn't ready yet for you. Let me see what I can round up. There you go. I can't eat these. They make me sick. Let me see if I can find something else for you. You got an eye for something else. You really want this? Well, I've got other ways of telling time. Tell you what. You hang on to it real tight, and don't lose it. And don't tell anybody else. They'd get jealous. People want what they can't have. You're not supposed to tell anyone. I got you too good. Don't do that. Did they really used to drive dead people in this thing? Yeah. Dad said they did. Cool. Do you wanna go to the haunted bridge again? Not tonight, I don't think. What's the matter? Nothing. I just thought you're hanging out with Vincent again. Your brother's off scaring people with your dad. Okay. Besides, I don't wanna hang out with your brother. I wanna hang out with you. Do you want any of my candy? You can have this one. - I can't eat it. - Okay. I also got this. Check it out. Oh, that is cool. This guy just gave it to me. It's pretty neat. Do you think we'll be friends when we're older? I think we'll know each other. But are we going to be friends? Sure. How many times do you think that hand will spin before that happens? I don't know. You don't have weird thoughts like that? I do sometimes, I guess. Like what? I wanna hear. Sometimes I wonder what I'll look like when I'm older. Sometimes I think about if I would think about me now. Like your older self is watching you through memories. Pretty much. I think about that stuff too. Damn. You get scared easy. No, I don't. You jumped. You were scared. No, I wasn't. I think you're cute when you're scared. You wanna try? Ready? Three, two, one. Three... I'm gonna go get some candy. I like your hair. I like your hair. Are you scared? Winnie? Winnie? Winnie? I'm sorry. I'm sorry! I'm sorry. I wasn't paying attention. Stop! Stop! Stop it! Somebody help! Winnie, I'm so sorry. I'm going to get help. Stay with me! Stay with me! Please! Vincent! Vincent! Winnie's... Winnie's in the car. You have to help. You have to help! What were you doing in there, Charlie? Listen. I'll take care of it. Just don't tell anyone. Her parents are worried sick. She never came home last night, and they don't have any idea where she is. Can you imagine how that feels for a parent? Look, if you guys know anything, this is a safe place to talk about it. You wanna talk about it? Charlie? I already said I didn't see her. And if you guys are scared, that's okay. Do you think she's dead? Is that what you're afraid of? It could be a possibility, but... we don't wanna think about that. We wanna be strong for her parents and give them hope. Is there any way people can come back? Only in pretend. In the context of our haunted house... sometimes it's fun to talk about death, and sometimes it's not so fun, like now. But it's a natural thing. Death happens, and sometimes it's suddenly. It can happen any time. You could slip, hit your head funny. You could have an allergic reaction, choke on some food. Get sick. It could happen anytime, anywhere. But can she feel anything? No. She wouldn't. But that's not the case, so we need to concentrate on how we feel. Okay? What if someone hurt her? Charlie. Charlie, do you know something? Did you see her talking to somebody? You can tell me. You're not gonna get in trouble. I don't know. I saw her talking to someone. When we were trick or treating, we went by the old man's house. He said we could come back whenever. I better call her mom. Can we go to our room? Yeah. Come on, Charlie. He's there, Johnny. He's gonna get in. We gotta do something! Real quick. Can we start again? We wanna go just before that. From? It's a new page. There's some rewrites the director wants to include. - Where is everyone? - Real quick. Can you slay it again? Sure. Laura Drake, reading for Claire. I'm five foot four. Laura Drake, five foot four... You can go ahead and start. Where is everyone? It's too dark. Wait, what was that? There's someone out there! Hey! How'd it go? I don't wanna talk about it. Oh, okay. Alright. I'm tired of waiting. Like, you get stuff. It's not like I'm jealous. I mean, I am, but not in a "I hate you" kind of way. I'm happy for you. I just want some of that. You could write something. Every time I sit down at a keyboard I feel like I've been amputated at the wrist. You could drink something. I feel like you could use one of these. You know, I guarantee you'd get a lot more roles if you stopped overthinking so much. Yeah, you're right. You're always right. No pity party. Not today. Come on. I'll help you out. I thought you had to learn those lines. Yeah, but you can help me run them when we get back. - Back from where? - Back from... I thought we could pound a couple of these, go for a bike ride and clear your head. - Yeah? - Yeah. Cool. Well, then bottom's up. Right? Cheers. Mm-hm. Let's do it. Let's make something. - I told you it's not that easy. - Why not? I think we can do it. I'll help you. We can write parts for you and me and we can make it for no money, too. - It could be a calling card. - Yeah. And if not, even if no one sees it, and you and me are the only ones who do, imagine. Our kids, or our kids' kids, stumbling on this movie. Seeing us, see how cool we were. That's my speech. Respond. Okay. So where do we set it? The lake. Are we, like, on vacation? No, I think we should live there. Okay. We've lived there our entire lives. - That's cool. - And we're trying to get away. Yeah. Okay, yeah. Something's gotta happen, like, our dad disappears. Is that okay? Yeah, that's fine. Okay, so something happens, and he wanders off... Sorry, one second. Hello? Who is it? It's the casting people from that shitty movie. Oh my God, tell them to go fuck themselves. - No! - Yes. I'll do it. Go fuck yourselves! Go fuck yourselves. We don't need them. - We're making a movie. - Yeah. Yeah! Man. Kid threw up in the labyrinth. Sorry to hear that. You okay? No. I don't feel so good. Sorry to hear that. Will, can you take him to headquarters and talk to Nadia? Can you get on the PA and ask for the parents? - Sure. - Okay. - Hey, what's up? - Two, please. Yeah, that's 15. He's scared. Who is? The very nervous boyfriend behind me. Is this gonna freak him out? - We can try our best. - Good. I like when it's intense. Can I get you two to sign this? How about that? - You guys have a good time. - Thank you. Let's go. You can talk to your little buddy later. laughs] Captain! We have prisoners. This sucks. You are about to witness my ultimate creation. Time traveling... The land beyond time. I am Doctor Gregor Rowaster. Yes, the Gregor Rowaster. If you choose to follow me, you must heed great caution. - My latest experiments... - Oh, shit! Sorry! Travel in my invisible void and go deeper... Hey! Get off of him! Come on! He touched first. We can touch back. Those are the rules. He signed the waiver, right? He knows. He read it. Yeah? You're fine. You're fine. - Alright. Keep going. - You guys are fucking wild. ...but they hold great danger for all of you. You'll see, should you... Alright. Thanks, you guys. Slow down. Hey. I wanna talk to you. Shit. Tam, you didn't see them having a good time? - I don't want any part of this. - You've never made a mistake? Wait. Where you going? You can't convince me to stay this time, Charlie. - Not worth it. - Hold on. - Where are you going? - I'm done. I can't spend another minute with this psycho. Psycho? Vince? He's not a psycho, it's Vince. He tackled another guest. He signed the waiver. There's something seriously wrong with him, Charlie. I always feel him watching. And he hurts animals. Now that, that was one bird, and he has apologized for it. Right? He's sorry. You're sorry, aren't you? - I'm very sorry. - See? He's sorry. Don't lie to me, Charlie. What are you doing? These halls are the key to my safe return, but they pose great danger for all of you. So I was thinking if the dad calls the son... Is everything cool? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Okay. So, I think if the dad calls the son at work, we can't have the son answer. Why wouldn't he answer? Maybe he's flirting with a girl. I like that. Oh my god, 'cause we have that new girl at his job, and we haven't done anything with her. Perfect. Would you write that in? - Yeah. Let me add stuff. - Look through everything, 'cause I have notes in there, like, for the scene over there. You're quiet. I guess it was the call. Got me in my head a little bit. When are you not in your head a little bit? She just gets weird this time of year. - We both do. - Yeah, I bet. You should visit, or at least call. - I haven't seen her in years. - I think that's more reason. - I'll go with you! - Yeah? Maybe we could do some writing there. We can write about your hometown. Maybe. There's nothing exciting happening back there. It's kind of just a town you pass through. Gosh, please! There's so much. There's country roads. There's, like, tons of fields... It smells burned. Sorry about that. Yeah. I'm headed out, Charlie. Ashley will come switch with you in a bit. Don't give this fine gentleman bad coffee. We see him too often for that. Sounds good, Lou. Hey. You can take a seat wherever you'd like. Hey, what can I get you to drink? You guys have liquor? Oh, no. No. We have hot chocolate, though. - Best in town. - Sure. Whatever. - Do I know you from somewhere? - I don't think so. Is it Laura? - Yeah. - Yeah, you're Winnie's sister. How do you know about my sister? Well, it's Charlie. We grew up by each other. Families were friends. Yeah. Charlie. You used to come over all the time. Sometimes. Might be thinking of my brother, Vincent. Yeah. I remember him, too. You know, you can go. I'm really not gonna be good company right now. No, no. That's not it. I was just... now might not be the best time, but I do wanna talk. Are you in town much longer? Maybe we could... meet up another time? Maybe. Yeah. I can chat now. Yeah. I got a second. The drinks. I'll get drinks. The hot chocolate. So, you're an actress. Got out of town, making movies, getting famous. That's pretty cool. Well, gotta have parts to be an actress. How did you know that? Your mom's still in town, so... I hear things. Your family used to run that haunted house, right? Still do. At least Vincent and I. Dad's... dad's gone. I'm sorry to hear that. It's alright. It's not bad working there either, so... So is that what you wanna do for the rest of your life? Scare the shit out of people? I'm sorry. I don't know why I said it like that. - I told you, I'm shit company. - No. No, I... It's not all bad. It beats working in a cubicle and I like seeing Vincent happy. I get it. My sister loved that place. She would go over there all the time, and I was afraid to even go past the parking lot. And she was three years younger. What does that say? She got scared, too. You know? So, you like, really knew her then? Not so well. I mean, how well can you really know someone that age? I think sometimes I trick myself into thinking I knew her better than I really did. Yeah. I think I did the same thing. Like... I kind of made up that her favorite food was spaghetti. It was a weird thought realizing I'd made it up, you know, cause I didn't realize I had for years. Then... I don't know. I guess if you go long enough without someone existing, you start to rewrite who they were. So, you think I could see the house sometime? The haunt? The place is a dump. You don't wanna go there. I doubt it. I've always wanted to see the behind the scenes in one of those places. Well, we're remodeling at the moment, but maybe when we're done, we can... you can go check it out. It's okay if I don't, really. I probably shouldn't be around people right now. I think it's more complicated than that. I can show you some time. I do wanna keep hanging out. Maybe now is just not... Drinks are on me, okay? You don't have to do that. No, it's okay. You'll get them next time, yeah? It's Winnie's sister. I didn't know she was coming. Laura? She looks like shit. She's about to head out. - So if we can just... - Excuse me? Your boss said you're to take care of me. You work at that haunted house, don't you? It didn't seem so scary to me. You actually scare people? Or do you just use that to get screaming girls in there? I know you know what I'm talking about. Look, I'm here for breakfast, lunch, and supper, and you've still barely said more than a sentence. Charlie number two. Good to see you again. Your brother was just bringing up my spirits. Was he now? Thanks for the cocoa. Jesus, are there three of you? I'm sorry, did I scare you? No, it's okay. Where you going off to, so late at night? I still have to find a motel. I'm not ready to see my mom yet. You can come to the Haunted House. Now? Why not? I mean, it's pretty late. Charlie made it seem like it wasn't ready for visitors. Nonsense. Don't listen to Charlie. He doesn't know what he's talking about. You come with me, I'll give you the private tour. I mean, if it's okay with him. I don't wanna intrude. Don't worry about Charlie. We'll have a good time and Charlie's gonna love it. Can I come by tomorrow? I wouldn't have it any other way. Alright, then. Good seeing you again. Heed great caution. My next experiment... Hey, Vince. What's going on? You're supposed to scare in my room. Vince? You okay? Turn it off. What are you talking about? These portals are the key to my safe return. I said turn it off. - Can you stop with the mystery? - Can we have a second? No. I wanna hear. I wanna speak to my brother alone. It's okay. I got it. Thank you. So, what is it? What do you wanna... What you wanna talk about? There's a cold breeze blowing through the town, and it's got me feeling inspired. This is it, Charlie. This is the sign we've been waiting for. Okay, I really don't want to fight tonight, so... Fight? I don't wanna fight. Why'd you think I wanna fight? if you'd listen to me, Charlie, I'm saying... this isn't us. What we're doing isn't us. This is the same old stuff. Old stuff, like... The same old stuff that's kept us in business this long? - That old stuff? - The same old stuff that has kept us back from reaching our full potential. Okay, so... full potential? What does that mean to you? 'Cause to me, it looks like this. It looks like we have the only haunt in town that's been scaring folks for generations just fine. You know, if it works, it works. Amityville. Now there's a house that has had its legacy burned into the ground, and they didn't have to waste a dime on some plastic skeleton to get there. We have to bring something new to the table. Something personal. You have to have an edge. You have to be extreme to get their attention. Okay. Let's break it down. Amityville, that's not a haunt. That's a crime scene. You wanna kill a family? Is that what you mean that by extreme? Don't do that. Don't talk down to me. I'm talking about legacy, Charlie, and what's going to be burned to the ground after we're gone. I'm talking about the fact that you and I could be more than we are right now. That if we wanted to, we could have the whole town afraid of us. That's exactly it. I don't want the whole town afraid of us. Not more than they already are. I mean, we got bills to pay. We're in previews. We are weeks away from the most crucial financial time of the year for us, and you wanna pull the plug before game day? I mean, it's not... It's too risky. What I want is to know that we're still in it together. I think that you're upset right now. I do. You always take these things too personal. And I just think that... if we could just get through the end of this year, we can absolutely revisit this conversation next year. Please don't do anything dramatic. Yeah. Next year. Next year. Next year. Next... year. Alright! Everyone listen up, because I'm only going to say it once. We are closed for the season. We're done. And I want everybody on this property off in one hour. You can keep your costumes. You can leave them. Frankly, I don't give a shit. Nothing dramatic. You got it. Jesus. So, Margaret, Laura. Laura, Margaret. Sorry. I didn't think I'd actually get you. You're good. You should work here. - Yeah? - Yeah. I think I could do it. Let's keep going, but you're walking in front. So, this is Tom. He's lovely. He's very... - Muscular? Yeah. - Yeah. Yeah. He's got a brother somewhere around here, but I think he might be in the shop. For a broken spring, or something. Where's the other half? He's the one that asked me to come here. He left a bit earlier, but he's around. You don't know where he goes? No, but I don't think it's a big deal. I mean... he just needs to be alone, I think. I'm sorry if what I'm about to say sounds insensitive, but was this the last place you saw her? - Winnie? - Yeah. Like this specific spot? Or, I mean, in the haunt? - Yeah. - I saw her in the haunt. It was right before they went trick or treating. You didn't go with them? No. Like I said, I don't normally dress up. And there's a hearse a little bit farther down, and that's where I would hang out. Can you show me? It's probably full of snakes and spiders, but maybe another time or... Okay. What was Winnie's favorite part? I don't know... I don't know in the haunt, but there was a place a little farther out that way. And it's not terribly exciting, but it is a place we used to go to. We should go. - Right now? - Yeah. I don't think Vince is going to like it if he comes back and I'm not here. Who cares? You'll be with me. Okay. Yeah. As long as we don't take long. That should be fine. Should be. The fuck do you want? Take the truck! Go! Just take it! Just please... please just don't... Sorry about all the glass and profanity on the ground. You come here often? Not so much anymore. Used to be a bit of a retreat. I wish I could say we would read and talk about our feelings, but I think we liked watching stuff fly off the bridge. Winnie came with you? Most of the time. So you guys were friends? I never said we weren't friends. We were just... I knew her as well as you could know someone at that age. Did you have a crush on her? - Come on. You can tell me. - Did she tell you that? 'Cause... I knew you guys were close. Yeah, I wish. It's not that we weren't close. It's just that she was my sister and I thought she'd always be there. You know, I thought I had time to not care about her. To be annoyed by her. I lost someone else recently. Not that Winnie's dead. I mean, she probably is, but this other person, my friend, she's... yeah. She's definitely gone. It already feels like that's the way it's always been. Like, of course that happened. I've got bad luck in my bones. It follows me around like a dark cloud. You still wanna be around me? Yeah. Yeah. I got bad luck, too. I think it actually cancels each other out, - so we'll be okay. - Really? Yeah. I mean, I got a dead mom. - Got an alcoholic dad. - I got a dead dad. Dead sister. Missing. Whatever. I'm in debt. In my home town. Left my home. Left my new home. Came back. Still in debt. Totally lost. - Single. - Single. I've had three dogs, and they've all run away in the same year of getting them. You have some good luck, too. I mean, you've got a brother that cares about you. You've got another half, even if he's a bit of a character. Yeah, character. He... He's a good guy. Look, I know he's intense, but it's all part of the act. He's all... he's all veins on the outside. He lets things get to him. But he's protective. And he's passionate. You know, he loves what he does. He's good at what he does. he pushes me to be better. It's exciting. Do you think he's dangerous? No. No, just... protective. Passionate. Charlie? Charlie? Where's the audition at? Welcome. Head down there. You're gonna park on your left and then meet us at the stage. Sounds good. Thought you guys canceled the haunt? Thought we did, too. What's up? We're opening back up. Old faces were getting tiresome and we could use some new, fresh ones. We closed earlier today. That was before. There's been a change of plans. No time to dally on the details. We have work to do, and we are weeks away from Halloween. Laura, would you like to stay and watch? Yeah. I guess I could stay for a little bit. I should really see my mom tonight, though. No, it's fine. She'll be there tomorrow and you're gonna wanna see this. Your sister, she loved the auditions. Yeah, I'll stay. Sure. Are they weird? Yeah. It's weird. Would you mind waiting for us at the stage? Thank you. What? What I do? Change is in the air, Charlie. In your hand is a cup. And in that cup is poison. Take a sip, say your name, and your greatest fear. Grimes. Spiders. You can feel the poison moving down your throat, rotting everything it touches. It gets hard to think. Hard to breathe, hard to keep your eyes open. Pass the cup. Jade Spellman. Small spaces. You feel the poison moving down your throat, rotting everything it touches. It gets hard to think. Hard to breath. Hard to keep your eyes open. Pass the cup. Take a sip. Jack Carpenter. Needles. You can feel the poison moving down your throat, rotting everything it touches. It's getting hard to think. Hard to breathe. Hard to keep your eyes open. You can feel your heart start again, but it's not the same as before. It is something different. It is unholy, broken, lost. Now, rise, and let the poison dictate your actions. Your body is a shell. You are nothing more than little, pink insides. And you have no control over what your shell does. You have no control over what your body does. No control over what you are. Now you're an animal. Alright, now stop. Stop, that's enough. That's enough. You... you can go. Animal killer. What did you say? I said that guy kills animals. And I bet you do, too. Bunch of fucking psychos. Charlie? Can you take these two to get their paperwork done? Thank you. Sorry, man. I shouldn't have yelled. I've had a really shitty birthday. It's been. You can't talk to my brother that way. I don't know, man. It's my birthday. Give me a role. I'll do whatever you want, man. I'll be a zombie. A ballerina. Wait right here. See if we can find you something. Okay. Cool. Thanks so much. I see you found the make-up. I hope that's okay. I'm sorry you had to hear that out there. He was just saying shit, right? Mostly rumored. I have killed an animal once. You kill one bird and nobody ever lets you forget it. I mean, hunters aren't held to the same type of scrutiny. But yes, I killed an owl. One owl. I was in the haunt, and the owl had gotten stuck in the labyrinth. Unable to escape. And so I went outside and I got a big stick, so that I could help the little guy. But I helped a little too hard, and I knocked him to the ground. And I watched... as the owl laid on its back, flapping its wings desperately trying to get up. And so I did the merciful thing, and I took that stick... and I shoved it through the center of its body. And I have seen death before, but I have never seen it like that. Never so intimately. And later that night, I was going through the haunt, and I heard it. I heard the owl... call my name. Gotta keep up the image, I guess. What? The whole haunted house, "I'm a spooky guy" image. I like what I do. I can relate. I was working on a horror film before I came here. That's right. Charlie told me. The actress. Yeah. But who are you? Who are you but an apparition? The girl that used to live here, that used to have friends. The girl that used to have a sister. There it is again. Always on the job. Definitely admirable. Well if you like that, you should come to my new haunt. I'm opening it soon. I think you'd like it. And if nothing else, it will shake you loose. Not really my scene. Well, while you are in town, which I've been led to believe will not be long, maybe you can refrain from harassing Charlie. I haven't harassed Charlie. He is a sensitive boy, and he does not need some girl poking and probing about the past. He's not a baby, Vincent. And I'm not probing. He doesn't wanna be here, you know? He has his own dreams. And sooner or later, you're gonna have to let him go. No. No, he's not going anywhere, and he knows that. And why is that? Because he knows that if he goes... I will haunt him until the day he dies. And then some. Hey, you guys coming out? Hey there, Charlie. Hey. Everyone's waiting. What you wanna tell them? I'll come out in a moment. You didn't tell me your friend Laura here is a real artist. She can speak for herself, so... Yeah. Well, she doesn't scare easy either, so... I'm gonna have to try a little harder. You okay? I'm sorry about whatever he said to you. Wanna get drunk and go for a bike ride? What are you still doing here? You said you might have another role for me. No. Go home. Happy birthday. Fuck that guy. Fuck that guy! Surprise! Who's that guy? Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Did you ever play at this park when you were little? Oh, yeah. All the time. I had my first kiss in those woods back there. Tristan Summers. It was a dare, so I don't know if it really counts. I think that counts. I think a dare counts, right? Where was your first kiss? Probably somewhere around here, right? I don't remember. Who doesn't remember their first kiss? Well, to be fair, I'm sure it was incredibly underwhelming. I smoked weed for the first time here, too. Okay. Okay. I guess the better question is what haven't you done here? A lot of stuff. Was it something like... "Hey, Tristan. I dare you to kiss me." "Okay, Laura. But only because it's a dare, and it doesn't count." I mean, it was true love, right? Not really. We never talked again. The last I heard, he was in jail for selling drugs to kids. But you're not like... - waiting for him or something? - No. Not that I know of. Cool. Cool. Can I tell you a secret? Oh, yeah. When I was younger, I used to hate this side of my face. And I would hide it from pictures, and I would... you know, pull my hair down to try and cover it up. I don't know why I did that. I mean, I... if it helps, I like both sides of your face. That's the nicest and weirdest thing anyone's said in a while. - Can I tell you a secret? - Yeah. I actually got this from your sister. She came by the night that she disappeared, and gave it to me, and I was gonna tell you, I just never thought... it was the right time. It felt weird and I knew that... you wouldn't like me afterwards. And I want to preface it with I'm sorry. What are you talking about? I'm sorry. I don't mean to freak you out. I... okay. - Well you can't not tell me now. - No, I... - You have to tell me. - I promised I wouldn't, but I... I... I loved your sister... a lot. Well, at least I think I loved her, and she came by after trick or treating. She came to the haunt to see me and give me the watch, and I should have stayed with her that night. Had I stayed with her, she'd probably still be here. - What? - I'm sorry. Who told you not to say anything? - Nobody. - Was it Vincent? What did he do? Why is everything Vincent's fault? This was a mistake. Coming here was a mistake. - Wait. I'm sorry. - I have to go. Hold on, I'm not finished. I still... Laura? What are you doing here in the middle of the night? Hey, Mom. What's wrong? I'd come visit more often. I would. It's just, you know, I... had a lot going on. I've been busy. Yeah, I know. Well, come on in. You're letting in all the cold. So, you talked to dad recently? No. - You? - Nope. When did you get in to town? A couple of days ago. Oh. I was always gonna come here. Actually, that's the reason I came down. It was just hard. And I got distracted. I was hanging out with the haunted house twins. It's been a minute since I thought about them. Are they well? Yeah, they're okay. They're weird. They always have been. Their dad was a bit of an oddball, too. Never did like that place. I don't know what your sister saw in it. Yeah. I went through it once. After your sister... I don't know. I guess I just... I don't know. Thought there'd be some kind of connection to her. It's stupid, huh? No, it's not. My friend died. I'm sorry to hear that. She was my best friend, actually. Everything was going great. We were living together and we were working on a movie. And then, she just... there was a car wreck. That's such a waste. Life can be cruel like that sometimes. I left everything behind. I left the movie. I left my job. And I don't know what to do. You know? Everything blew up. And I don't know what to do. I just knew I had to come home. I had to see you, and I wish I could see dad, and I wish I could see Winnie. Honey. It's okay. It's okay. Her room's the exact same as when she left it. I think she'll appreciate that when she comes back. It's probably stupid to hold hope like that, but... bigger miracles have happened before. I think she'll appreciate it, Mom. I always try to imagine what she'd look like now. I don't know if I'd recognize her in a crowd. She'd be so different. I don't even know if she'd recognize me. Where are you staying? The old motel off Robin Trail. Don't be silly. Stay here tonight. I'll go fix up the guest room for you. Okay. Don't move. I won't. Do you know what you're gonna be for Halloween? I don't wanna dress up. Why not? I just don't. Well, I'm going as a witch, and I think you should go as a possessed girl. Like The Exorcist. Who let you watch The Exorcist? Nobody. I watched dad's copy. So, I get to be the gross vomit girl, and you get to be the cute witch? Fine, we can switch. It's okay. I don't wanna switch. Don't move! You gonna drink it or just study it? You think I'm a bad person, Lou? No, you're not a bad kid. Trust me. I know what that looks like. Plus, you drink hot chocolate. Bad people drink hot chocolate, too. No. They don't. They don't let their brothers pick on them all the time. This doesn't have anything to do with him, does it? He isn't getting you into any trouble? No, he didn't do anything. It's not his fault. It's not. Hey, guys. Usual? Yes, ma'am. How's it taste, pumpkin? It's alright. Where's your creepy little brother at? What? I think... I think... you got me confused - with someone else. - No, I don't think so. Let's go outside. I don't want any trouble. Come on, guys. Don't you have anything better to do? The kid's had a rough night. A rough night? What's the matter? Girl troubles? I don't wanna go outside so... Charlie! Stay out of our business if you know what's good for you. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! We can talk about it! We can talk about it! Help! Help! Help! Quit whining. At least your brother was a fighter. Leave him alone! The police are on the way. You just stay right there. We're leaving. Yeah, yeah. We're leaving. We're leaving. Charlie? Charlie, are you okay? Charlie? What they do to you? Charlie, you're gonna be okay. Hang in there. Hey, you ready? Give me a minute. Hey, Laura. It's Charlie. You don't have to call me back. I just wanna say I've been in the hospital for a bit. I'm not sure if your mom told you, but it was pretty bad. Well, I'm out now, and... if you're still in town, I'd love to see you. Come by the haunt later. You won't ever have to worry about that guy again, Charlie. I took care of it. And I'm gonna keep taking care of us as long as you stick with me, yeah? We can go back to that good old stuff you like, but better. Charlie! You're mad at me, Charlie. I can see it! I can see it all over your face. I can feel it! What do you want from me? You wanna come over here, and rip open those bandages and scream at me? Because I would love to see it. All we need is some change. Yeah, some closure. I can give that to us. Not next year. Tonight. Charlie was in the hospital? Why didn't you tell me? He called me earlier. I'm here to see him. Okay. Vincent, I don't want any trouble. He told me everything, but I'm not gonna say anything. Just please let me see him. Please? Of course. He's right inside. My mom knows I'm here. She's expecting me back soon. Charlie? That was good. You got me. But I don't wanna go through this stupid haunt, Vincent. Hey, man. How do I get out of here? Super helpful. Thank you. Charlie? Please! Help me! Help me! Is that the best you got? Almost looks real. I wanna show you something. Fuck you. That's not funny. It's not her. - No! No. - Let's take a closer look. No! No! Please! No! Hey, Charlie. I'm taking care of it. I got this. I did it. You don't have to do a thing. All you have to do is not tell anyone. Don't tell anyone, and we're gonna be okay. Yeah? - Help! Help! - What? What are you... are you mad at me? I... I... I did it for us. I mean, we can go back. - We can fix things. - Help! Help! I can take care of us. Charlie. Charlie, we're almost there. You just gotta not tell anyone. And I'm gonna fix it. I'm gonna fix it. - Yeah? - Is she okay? Give us a minute! Do you hate me? I'm doing the best I can, Charlie. I'm doing it for us, you know? I mean... you wanna hurt me? Do you care about her more than me? Do you wanna go to the police? 'Cause I won't be mad. I'm really not mad at you, Charlie. Just you... you just gotta tell me what you want, huh? Tell me what you want, Charlie! Tell me what you want. Tell me what you want, and I'll do it. And I'll do it. Okay. Okay. It was a good... scare though, right? That was the last time I saw you. I can still feel you watching. I can always feel you there. Just out of view. Out of sight in the shadows. I imagine you sitting alone, or... standing in a crowd. Always nearby. Always out of view. Do you remember what dad used to say to the guests? "Tell me, with some tender sentiment, the first time you looked out a dark window and wondered what could be looking back at you. If you remember the heartbreak you felt when you first learned that live and love are fragile things. If you've ever been enchanted by the night. And if, in addition, to experiencing one of these priceless sensations, you carry around a chill in your bones you've never been quite able to shake. Turn around now, for this may be too much for you." I know you remember. I can see you there. I can feel you there. And I know you're waiting. Waiting for the right moment to pop out and frighten me for the delight of it.
