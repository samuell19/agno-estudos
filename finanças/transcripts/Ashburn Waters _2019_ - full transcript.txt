Filthy. Are you seeing this fuckin' creep over here? While you're checking out dudes, I'm noticing the fine bit of puss dwelling within the tent over yonder. Ha. What, is she all of 15, you ped? Hey, if there's grass on the wicket. Amy? Good luck dealing with her old man. Amy. What? I'll drop that motherfucker. Yeah. She'll come back. She probably just got lost. Look, just stay there. I'll go and find her. Would you look at that? The 'rents are out of sight. It's time for big Filthy Phil to make his move. Are you serious, man? Yeah, dude. Where else am I gonna get a bit of poon out here? You dirty bastard. Well, off to drain that main vein. Hey, Mike. Don't touch me fuckin' beers. Filthy? You all right, mate? Dude. Are you taking a dump? All right. Well while you're back there unleashing the kraken, I'm gonna go and hit on your girl. Hey. Hi. I just wanted to warn you. My friend's about to come over here and hit on you. He's harmless. Just tell him to piss off and he'll leave you alone, okay? Okay. Okay. Have a good night. Hey, excuse me? Sorry. You haven't seen my mum around, have you? Oh. No. Sorry. Okay, well, good luck with the search. Oi, Filth? Shit, Filthy. You passed out already? You lightweight. Are you for real, man? Filthy? Hello? I need help. Hello? Are you okay? Holy shit. Ah. Fuck off. Brett, open up. Binns? What are you doing here, man? Camping? I'm not coming, man. What do you mean you're not coming? You said you were. No, I didn't. I can't. I've got things to do. What? Like clean this shit? Do you even have a job anymore? Everybody from school is gonna be there, dude. I thought you were keen? Well, is she gonna be there? She's part of the group, man. Yeah, well no. Definitely no. Not if she's gonna be there. Shit. What are you doing? None of us have seen you for months, man. You've gotta get outta this dump. It'll do you good to see your friends again. Trim and Rhi. Cassie's coming. Nah. Just don't wanna see her. You gotta do something. You can't just sit around here all day. Fuck. It's too hard. I just wanted to get the group back together, but nobody seems to care. Let me know when you're ready to stop ditching your friends. Shit. Check it out. Ah, Cassie's still playing Mum. Of course she's the only one packing. I'm gonna get on that this weekend. Yes, sir. Why the sudden interest? I dunno. She got hot? You coming? No, I'm just gonna wait here. Look, you said we be cruising soon, Binns. What's the point? Let's just go already. Hey. How you doing? - I brought Brett. - Really? Hey. So, how're you doing? Leo, where are you? I said be here by 10. Ah, Brett. What the fuck, Trimmer? - Fuck. - What are you doing in here? Floggin' it? Fuckin' 'bout time you made an appearance. What, floggin' it like you were- - Ah, does Binns have the beer in the back? Mate, you've already got one. Now I need another one. Jason, did you get my bag? Yeah girl. Cassie's sorting that shit. Hey, Brett. Rhi. Good to see you. Go help her. And stop drinking. It's still morning. Don't act like you don't like the freaky shit I do to you when I'm drunk. Oh, hey man. Let me help. Here, here. Bro, I had it. Righto. Finally. I didn't think you'd make it. Oh, Brett. This is Leo. Yeah, we've met. What the fuck, man? What? What do you mean, what? You invited Scout's new boyfriend? Oh. Look, man, I'm sorry. She wouldn't come without him. I wanted the whole group to be together again. Fuck, you gotta think. Just take me home. Come on. Don't, just don't. It'll be fine. Fine? I don't want to see this, Binns. I don't wanna see her, let alone that arsehole all over her. Look, man, I'm sorry. I just wanted you to be here. It's just so hard getting everybody back together. Well things have changed since high school, man. Oh, great. What's wrong, Brett? Okay. Where's Cassie? Hey, Brett. Hey, Cas. Hey, Cas, I thought work wouldn't give you time off? Oh, the emergency ward can do without me for the weekend. I wasn't gonna miss this. Rhi's car was full with all the gear on the backseat, man. They had to come with us. All right, let's do it. Oh, come on. There has to be something. Can't we just set up in that little piece of grass near the toilet block? You can't set up there, I'm sorry. You should've made a booking. Surely not every site was booked out. Well, no they weren't, but those sites were filled early this morning. Hey, mate. You come in here on a Good Friday at lunchtime and expect to get a site without a booking? Ha, mate. This is our busiest time of the year. Merv. I don't see why you have to laugh at me. Yeah, you should head down to. Yeah, you know that place. You know the one. The one where those people died and they closed it down. Oh, Ashwood. Ash- - Ashburn. Ashburn Waters. Yeah, head down there, mate. They're gonna have plenty of space. Merv, stop it. Ha ha. Okay. There's been a problem with bookings or whatever and there isn't any space left here, but I've got another campground we can go to. Where's Brett? What? Where is he? Aw. What are you doing? Calling a taxi, man. I don't have to put up with this shit. What the fuck? What has she done? She's doing it right now, Binns. She's flaunting her new dick right in my face. Man, stop being like this. No, you stop being like this. I didn't want to come here in the first place. You fuckin' guilt tripped me. Brett? You don't have to leave. We have so much to catch up on. I haven't seen you in so long. Okay, Cas, but we're staying away from them. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. You're good. So you're staying? Fuck you. Hey. So, where are we going, Binns? Yeah, how could you forget to book, Binns? Hey, it's my bad. I didn't know. Shit. How do you forget to book a campsite on Easter weekend, man? Well I'm sorry, Brett, but I did. Maybe if I wasn't using all my energy to actually get you guys here, I might have remembered. So. Where are we going? To this place I heard about. Shouldn't be too far. Wait here. Excuse me, mate. What can I do for you? I was just wondering how far Ashburn Waters is? Why do you wanna go there? Well, we wanna camp there. Well, you can't. Campground's closed for business. I was hoping to talk to the owner out there. If you could just tell me- - I am the owner. Campground's are closed. Stay away from there. What's happening, yo? Who's that motherfucker? Just the owner of the place we're going to. Says it's just up the road. Why's he taking the sign down? Bet you don't have a booking there either. Nah, it's cool. This place has plenty of space, trust me. Jason. Oh, shit. I'll bet those motherfuckers are dying to get in. You can be such an insensitive prick. What the hell is this? Is this it? Whoa, whoa, dude. What are you doing? Binns, this is a crime scene. You can't touch that. Okay. We've gotta hide the cars and then walk the rest of the way. Hide the cars? I told you I would find us a campsite and the best part is we have it all to ourselves. Dude, we can't do this. It's trespassing. We'll get fuckin' arrested. Look. I'm sorry. I messed up. I just wanna have a good time with my friends, you know? And this is the only option we have left. We're already here, so we may as well go in. This tape looks like it's been here for months. So I'm sure there are no cops around anymore. They'll be too busy busting drunk drivers and giving out speeding tickets over the holidays. And that guy before was the owner. We all seen him leaving. I doubt he'll be back for the rest of the weekend. How do you know that? Well, he was taking down the sign and he told me the place was closed. So why would he be here? What? I'm with this boy. We're already here. Let's just go in and get drunk already. I wanna go home. Why? I just have a really bad feeling about this place. Don't start with this shit again. Please, stop being such a jerk and listen to me. There's something wrong here. There's nothing wrong. It's just a camp. There's fucking police tape all over the gate. Well, we'll have to walk a fair way in so people don't see us from the road. My god, let's go in already. Come on, man. Live a little. This is crap. If you'd just booked a place, Binns, we wouldn't have to do this. You're welcome. Looks like we aren't the only ones here after all that. See? I told you guys it was sweet to camp here. He doesn't look happy to see us. I do not want to stay near him. Yeah, let's get as far away from that guy as we can. Isn't this sweet? It is pretty nice. Ugh. What's wrong, babe? No reception. Fine. You can set it up yourself then. Whatever. Probably do a better job without you anyway. Hey, Cassie. Wanna come find the toilet block with me? Toilets in this place won't be good enough for you. Please? Yeah, okay. Be right back. Jason, I wanna go home. Baby, it's cool to camp here. There's someone camping right over there. It's gotta be all good. All right, who wants a fuckin' beer? I mean, he can be really stupid sometimes, but he's just so hot. How long have you guys been together? About a week? Oh. There it is. I'm not using that. Disgusting. Gross. Hey bro, mind if I have one? Fuck yeah, boy. All you gotta do is ask. Oh, man. You gotta check out this river down here. It's fucking sweet. What are you doing? Why isn't the tent up? I was. Fuck. Man, I used to think she was hot. Now she's just a fuckin' bitch. You dodged a fuckin' bullet there, Brett. What are you people doing here? Campground's are closed. You will leave if you know what's good for you. What the fuck are you gonna do? Jason. Hey, man. Look, we don't want any trouble. Trouble found you just by being here. Leave. Now. He's not the owner so he can't do shit. My hero. Arsehole. Yeah, fuck that douche. He's just pissed because we crashed his party. Let's get fuckin' drunk. Ah bigerk. Yeah, hit me, Trim. Cannonball. Comin' in? Hm. Nah. Okay. Damn. Look at Cassie's bod. Cassie. You gotta jump in. Oh, no. Nah, seriously. You can't come in otherwise. Hey, Leo. Pop it up for ya mum. No, you gotta use the rope. No way. It's too shallow. It's my bad. Eh, cop a big feel there, Binns. What's up? Leo. Fuck you, Brett. Nice, bro. Hey, Cas. Hey. Hey. Yeah. Wow, you can be a real bitch. Fuck you, slut. Man. I'm just sick of people trying to ruin our weekend, you know? That guy was a real prick. Now where does he think he's going? Let that little bitch throw his tantrum. Here. Leo. He's over there somewhere. We should go fuck him up. Nah, but we should go see what's up. Maybe we can give him a scare like he did the girls. The girls? Man, it was you who was shitting your dacks. Fuck off. I was about ready to knock him the fuck out if he stuck around any longer. Hey, 'sup baby? I need to talk to you. What? I'm really scared. Of what? I don't know. I've just have a really bad feeling. Fuck me. There's nothing wrong. Why are you trying to ruin everyone's night? Jason, shut up. Why won't you listen to me? Because I'm sick of this shit. It's all a bunch of crap. What's the problem? Fuckin' Rhi sees like evil spirits or some shit. Jason. What? Like ghosts? Shut up, Binns. - Take me home. - Nah, fuck that noise. I'm here trying to have a good time and you're fucking it up as usual. Hello? Hello? Evil entities? Would you like a beer? I'm not talking to you, Binns. Can you just leave us alone for a second? No. Hold on. Now you're trying to fuck everything up, too. What is it with you people? Trying to mess with what I'm trying to do here? Look, we're all so grateful that you brought us here together this weekend. Doesn't mean you can act like such a dickhead. Trim, you gotta keep your bitch on a leash. You two can fuck yourselves. We gonna raid that dude's tent? Yep. Fuckin' shit. Fuck. Fuck. Shit. Cassie? Oh, are you all right? Aw, shit. So fucking sorry. Are you okay? Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. What are you doing, psycho? I was. I was over by the river. What's wrong? Something jumped me just now. What was it? I don't know. It was some sort of animal. I didn't really see it. It was too quick. Did it bite you? No, I don't. I don't think so. It jumped straight over the river. Right at me. I had to block it with this before it took off into the bushes. Maybe it was a possum. A possum? In the water? Okay, boy. Sounds like you need to go for a walk, calm down. Could've been a platypus. Fuckin' aye. You dip shit. Get fucked. What the fuck is this shit? How you doin'? I'm good. No, you're not. What was that back there? I just didn't want to come with her here. Hm. Yeah. That would be difficult. I dunno. Maybe it'll help you move on. I mean, you don't wanna get back with her, do you? Fuck no. Not after what she did. See? It's already starting to work. It's just the last few months, just haven't been able to get the image of Scout with that guy outta my head. Who Leo? No, no. The other guy. The guy I caught her with. Oh. I just don't know what I did to deserve this shit, you know? She wouldn't do something like that without having a reason to. I mean, did you spend enough time with her? What? People don't just throw away what you guys had. You clearly don't know Scout then. Do you? I guess I don't. Is that Trim? What's he doing? Dude, check out what I found. What's this creepy shit? I thought it was porn. Porn? Yeah, man. What else is he gonna do out here other than, you know, jerk the gherkin? Ah. Man, there's gotta be some dirty shit around here somewhere. I don't think this dude's gonna have anything like that. Looks like he's all religious and shit. Exactly. They're into the most fucked up shit. Oh, fuck. What are you doing here? Why are you still here? Where are you going, fuckhead? Ah bigerk. Oh, shit. Jason? Jason? Jason? Jason? Should we go check on her? Yeah, Brett. You wanna go see what's going on? All right. Jason? Shut up. Rhi? Brett, he hasn't come back yet. Well he, you know Trim. He does stupid things when he's drunk. He's probably passed out in the bushes somewhere. That's what worries me. Can I come in? Are you okay, Rhi? This isn't the first time Trim's disappeared. I mean, he always comes back. I'm not so sure this time. This place scares me. Wait, is it that creeper guy? I don't think we need to worry about him. I don't know. I just get a really bad feeling here. What kind of feeling? Like something wants to hurt us. There's something really bad here. I'm so scared. Hey. Why don't we go look for him? Would that make you feel better? Oh, Brett, would you? I just, I need to know he's okay. Yeah, yeah. It's no problems. I'll go get Binns. He can help us. What is happening? Trimmer hasn't come back yet. Who fuckin' cares? Trimmer's always disappearing. Oi, Binns. Come help me find Trimmer. Why? Come on. You know he's just gonna be blacked out in the dirt somewhere. Trim. Trimmer. Hey, fuckhead. Come back so the rest of us can get some sleep. What? Trim. Trim. Trimmer. What's going on? Trim. Oh, it's just Trimmer being his usual dumb arse self. Trim. Come on. Trim. Trimmer. Trimmer. Trim. Trimmer. Trim. Trim. Ah. What? There. Jason. Jason. It was him. Fuck. Ah. Ah, my fuckin' ankle. You gotta get me away from him, man. You gotta get me away. Rhi. Rhi. I need you to help Binns. Go. I'll catch up. Let's go, let's go. What the fuck happened? Oh my god. Oh, that is so gross. Oh my god. Is he really dead? Oh, Trim. Rhi, I'm so sorry. It was that guy. He's a fucking killer. This is your fault. Jason is dead because of you. We never should have come here. You knew. Rhi, I- - No, shut up. Why is the camp closed, Binns? What happened here, Binns? People died. People died here? Now Jason, my boyfriend, is one of them. You wouldn't listen to me. Nobody would listen to me. I didn't wanna come here. I wanted to leave. How did they die? Were they murdered? Oh man, this is fucked. Look, I think we should just go. Let's just leave. Let's just get all the stuff and let's just go. No, no, no. It's too late. I can't go out there now. We'd have to go pass his tent. It's between us and the gate. No, I'm not going anywhere near that fucking creep. We can't just stay here. Trim's dead. I don't think that guy could've done this. Why not? There's no external damage. It's all internal. His insides have been turned to mush. I've never seen anything like it. Well, what could've done that? I have no idea. What did you do to your ankle? Ah. We can't stay here. Binns has rolled his ankle pretty bad. There's no way he'll make it to the gate. It's too far. It is too far. We'll be safer here for now. Okay, well, we'll wait it out 'til morning, but we have to keep watch. Right. Well, I need to get some ice for this ankle. Can you help me back to the tent? I don't wanna be out here. Oh. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Keep an eye on Rhi, okay? Yep. Hey, where's your phone? Hey. It's not your fault. It is. No, it's not. I wanted to come here. I pushed for it. And now Trim is dead. It's all my fault. You had no idea what was gonna happen. You just wanted to get us all together again. You're a good guy, Binns. Whoa, what are you doing? Binns. We're friends, Binns. We always have been. But you get me, Cas. You have no idea how good that feels. Binns, stop it. Okay. Okay. Do what every girl does. Deny me. It's so unfair. I'm really a good guy, you know. I know you are, Binns. But you still treat me like shit. Everybody does. I'm sorry you feel that way but we all love you. You love Brett. What? Yeah, I mean, Brett's cool but- - You like him better than me, don't you? He's my friend, too, Binns. I love your hair, Cas. Stop. Only you would do something like this with everything else that's been going on. Unbelievable. Ah. I'm so sorry. Aw. Oh, come on. Please, not now. Aw. Oh my god, are you okay? No. I'm not okay. Leave that on there for another 15 minutes. Oh, great, yep. Leave me. Like every girl does. Hey, hey. Rhi. Rhi. Come on. Rhi. Something's going on out there. Who cares? Just hurry up and fuck me. But. It's your friend. Come on. What's wrong with you? Please? I need this. Look, I'm just gonna check, okay? Just gonna go check. You're a dickhead. Rhi. Rhi. Hey guys. She's over here. Come back here. Ah. Ah. Scout. Fuck sake, Scout, put some clothes on. Oh, it's not like you haven't seen it before. Scout, Rhi's dead, too. What? We found her in the bushes. Where's Leo? I don't know. He bolted off that way after he saw Rhi. Well, why didn't you go after him? I don't know. Binns, we have to go. You may not like it, but he's my boyfriend now. What? Look, just because you hate him doesn't mean you can leave him out there. Scout, I came back to get you. We have to go. You don't give a shit about me. Don't pretend like you do. I don't give a shit? I wish it was that simple. I wish I could just fucking move on, but ever since you did what you did to me, my whole life has been a fucking mess. Yes, I fucking hate you, and what you did to me, and my God I wish I could just forget about you, Scout, but the reason it hurts so much is because I do in fact give a shit. Just shut the fuck up and stop only thinking about yourself. Just for once. I'm trying to fucking help you, Scout. Let me. Now we have to go. We'll find Leo on the way. Let's go. Binns, we found Rhi. Something. She's. Something killed her. We have to go. Oh, great. Well I guess that's my fault, too. Oh my God, will you stop being such a sook? This had nothing to do with you. Ah. No, no, no, no. Go away. Get the fuck out of here, man. You'll need more than that to kill the beast. What did you do with my friends? I told you not to stay. You have no idea what you're up against. Hey, what are you doing? Don't look at her. Don't even think about it, man. It is when you are alone that it will attack. What will attack? Hey, stop. Hey. Stop. Ah. No, no. Ah. Get her back to your camp. Put her down here. Ah. Check her, see if she's all right. Are you okay? No. What did it, Scout? What was it? I don't know. I don't know what it was. Oh my God. Binns. Look, don't worry. We're gonna get outta here, okay. We'll find Leo. Oh my God. Oh my God. Wait, don't leave me. Scout, I'm right here. Oh, fuck. Oh. Oh, what the fuck? Holy shit. Settle down, look. Think he's here to help us. He saved you, Scout. Cassie. Get away from this. Thank you for helping us. What was that thing? What are you doing? Salt will deny it access to your camp. You need to get that fire going. Deny what? Demon. The demon? Man, you're not making any sense. What are you talking about demons, man? Demon. And the most desperate kind. It wishes to walk freely among us. To achieve this it must devour a certain number of souls within a particular perimeter here on earth. I believe that is this campground. It doesn't seem to venture far past the borders. It's becoming careless. Typically its kills are clean, precise. It is most likely agitated after I pinned it with my iron. So you know how to kill it? How is it you know so much about this? I've been hunting it here for months. We need to start that fire. Okay, demon. So you do know how to kill it, right? Iron and fire will harm it. And salt will stop it? Correct. We need that fire. It will keep it away from your friends when the circle can't. Cassie, start the fire. So iron and fire will kill it? I'm not sure. What do you mean you're not sure? How do we kill it? It is near on impossible to completely destroy a demon. You need more firewood. Brett. Binns. I'm so scared. Get off him. What the fuck are you doing? Stay away from him, you slut. Scout. No, you stay away from him, you fucking bitch. How dare you call me the slut? What's that supposed to mean? Well, only sluts cheat on their boyfriends. Don't even act like you know what is going on. You're the reason I did it. I'm the reason? What? - Scout, not now. - No. You had a thing for her. It was always Cassie, Cassie, Cassie. Whenever I needed you, you were always with her. What? So it just makes it okay for you to go fuck somebody else? Why didn't you just talk to me about it, Scout? You are so stupid. There was never anything going on between us. How could you think that I would do that? To you? We used to be friends. You know what? Fuck you both. I know there was something going on. I know it. No, there wasn't. Scout. Stop. I'm not gonna stop. Fuck you, Brett. You're a fucking bastard. Okay, look I'm sorry. Just please, Scout, just stop moving. Stay where you are. No, I'm not gonna stop. I don't have to do what you say anymore. I didn't make you do anything, Scout. Do not touch the salt. You made me cheat. You never cared about me. Scout, stop. Get her back in the circle. - Scout, come back. - Scout, stop. What do you care? This is all your fault, bitch. I'm really sorry about everything, but just come back and we can talk about it. Scout, come back in the circle now. Come back in the circle. I don't wanna talk about it. I wanna go home. Scout. Ah. What's it doing to her? It's taking her soul. Ah. She's gone. Why didn't you do something? There's nothing I could do, boy. Do not turn your back on the shadows. You could've done something, man. You just froze. You could've saved her. I have told you. It is not so simple to kill a demon. What was that? What the fuck was that? It's a demon. It will be back. It was afraid of the fire. Yes. Demons cannot stand fire. They are tortured with it for eternity in hell. So we can burn it to death? Technically, yes. I have thought of that method, but the beast is fast. It is a hard task to stop it long enough to catch it alight. What about the salt? The salt keeps the demon out. But we can use it to trap the demon in. Look, I know it's risky but maybe we can open up a part of the circle that we already have- - No. Listen, listen. Maybe we can lure it somehow. We can lure it onto the fire pit. Put a bunch of flammable stuff in it and I can make one of those cocktails. A Molotov cocktail. Look, we have heaps of alcohol. Once it's over the pit, we circle it with salt so it can't get out and hit it with the cocktail and boom we send that motherfucker back to hell. You may be on to something there, boy. Okay, once we have this part of the circle rubbed out, I'll stand over the fire pit and hopefully it'll come straight for me. Then you grab the bottle, light it- - No. No, this is my battle. I will act as bait. No, I can- - Just make sure your aim is true. Saint Michael, the archangel, defend us in battle. Be our protection against the wickedness ensnares of the devil. May God rebuke, we humbly pray. Brett. And do thou at once of the heavenly host. They're gone. All of our friends are dead. I know, Cas. But we're not gonna die. This is going to work. What if it doesn't? By the power of God, thrust into hell, Satan, and all evil spirits who wander through the world for the ruin of souls. Yah. Hurry, girl. Finish it. Get out of the circle. Get out of the circle. Cassie, no. Cassie, the salt. Shit. Cassie. Hey. We made it. We're okay. Let's just go. Yep. Yep. There you go. Come on, step up.
