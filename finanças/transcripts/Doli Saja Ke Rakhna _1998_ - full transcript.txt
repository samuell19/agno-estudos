- How are you? - Fine. College is over. And we've got our degrees. - It all happened so fast. - The way it is. - When do we meet again? - Why? We're taking MBA together. We'll get admissions easily. Daddy isn't going to be convinced. He says I've had enough education. He wants me to get into the family business. Talk him into it. It's just a matter of two years. Daddy can be talked into it. But Mummy is... impossible! No knowing what she might do to stop me. Your son's horoscope is fine. And the stars favor him. I don't think there will be any hurdles in your son's marriage. His mother has tried out at least a dozen girls by now. So where lies the problem. There were problems. That's why we went through all these rituals. The main problem is this fellow himself. And now you've told his mother that unless he marries this year... he will have to wait for fifteen years! Now the mother is up in arms to get him married. And the son says. He won't. This is Inder. My only son. - Greet them, son. - Greetings. Just back from Bangalore after graduation. First class. He wants to continue studying. But the wife wants a bride for her son. Now I don't know whom to say yes to. Please consult my horoscope, and tell me what I should do. Listen! - Want sandwiches? - No. - Samosas? - Not - Have you eaten? - I'm not hungry! You mustn't keep your stomach empty for more than two hours. I'm not hungry! I don't want to eat! What's wrong with him? You think hunger-striking is going to scare anyone? Even if you did scare us, that won't make you... a Vinoba Bhave or a Mahatma Gandhi. Just go and eat. - I don't want to. I said so. - What's your problem? My mother keeps nagging me. About getting married. About getting married? But you're married! To me! Stop joking, Daddy. I just want to know whether you'll let me take an MBA. No way! I failed my tenth standard exams eleven times! Yet I've made enough to feed seven generations! - But ... - No buts! We have decided. You're going to get married! Look at this one. Go on. Choose. Just choose one. Surely you'll like at least one. One of so many! You're going to choose. Right now. Sure! I'll let you know! Right away! I like every one of them! I'll marry every one! Let's do it! How dare you insult your father! I'lll kill you!? - Go on! Kill me! - Yes! I'll kill you! Listen... Listen to what? The boy won't obey his parents! No mercy for him! Come over here. Come on. In here. What is it? Why are you arguing with him? If he really wants to study, let him. Let him study? Did you say that? If he wants to study, let him do it. Go on. Tell him. All right. I'll tell him that. But you aren't going to change your mind about this. I won't. Tell him. Did Mummy say yes? Dad, I can't believe our plan succeeded so easily. The plan wasn't ours. It's your plan. For a change, you turned sharp. In that case, from now on, you call me Daddy. What did you say? You're the son! Rascal! - Are you cross with me? - No. Can ll go to the study? Go on. There's one thing. I'll think about your marriage only if you beg me. Get it? Then you'll get me a lovely bride! And she'll do all the chores for you. As of now, I want your blessings. Won't you bless me? You were worked up for nothing. A bit more of the harangue, and he would have wilted. Drop the act. I've taken the plot in my stride. Now let's see you handle my move. Missed him! You're finished! Who are you? What do you want? Colonel Nair! You don't recognize me? The Judge! Mr. Hariprasad Chaturvedi. Right? Come in! Tell me, how many years have we known each other? Several... Exactly 34 years. Fantastic memory! - Can ll have a glass of water? - Sure. But there's no one to serve you. She has gone away. How many years has it been since your wife passed away? 20 years. The anniversary is a few days away. You know, it was a great shock for me. I didn't let them take her away for the funeral. For three days, I sat holding her hand. I was expecting her to come awake any moment. Finally, they gave me a sedative. Then they cremated her. Ever since, I've been a bit off my rocker. - Who are you? My son. Lallan. What does he do? He has just taken an admission for an MBA course. In this city. I don't want him to go to a hostel. Then I suddenly remembered I have a friend living in this city. You, Colonel Nair. So ll came to you. Can he live with you? I'm not forcing myself on you. If it's inconvenient for you... Inconvenient? Chaturvedi and I were in the same class for five years. We shared the same bench. Chaturvedi's son is my son. You must live here. I'll send him over with his bag and baggage tomorrow. Yes! Let's go. From tomorrow, you go to college. - Look who's sitting here. - There he is. Where have you been? You've been missing all day. - You didn't attend the lectures. - You weren't in the canteen either. Fallen in love? Yes. Has she said yes? Not yet. Meaning you've found a girl. But she hasn't fallen for you. No problem. We'll woo her. For your sake, that is. Now what's her name? No idea. Her whereabouts? No idea. Well, is she good to speak to? Have you spoken to her? No. - She's for real, isn't she? - You've seen her, haven't you? Just a glimpse. You don't know her name, her address. How are you going to find her? I'll follow my heart. Poor fellow. He's on cloud nine. Hey! I've become a poet! Let's find her. There's another joke. Do you know why the ant hid behind the tree? Because it wanted to scare the elephant. Can we sit here? Sit down. Can we start a conversation? Please. As if we're old friends... Say something... I'm Pallavi. My friends... Poonam and Ritu. Those two are scoundrels. And that short one. The fatso with curly hair. He's a scoundrel! Don't you take his word. Please don't misunderstand. We were in trouble. Now it's over, thanks to you. Actually, her parents are very strict. We had been to a matinee show without taking their permission. Those boys in the car were sitting in the row behind us. - Then they started teasing us. - They tried to talk to us. And then they pinched us. From behind. We were so scared, we ran. But they followed us. They offered us a lift. We refused. Then they threatened to force us into the car. That's why we came in here. Please don't mind us. Not at all. Thanks. We'll be leaving. What if they come back? The streets are unsafe for girls nowadays. The hooligans, you know. Wait here. We'll fix them. Forget it. They won't come back. We'll fix them if they come back. - How far are you going? - To the station. - We'll take a train. - We'll drop you at the station. - Never mind. We'll manage. - Why take chances? Sit here. If they return, we'll fix them. Good. Wait here for them, while I drop them at the station. - Come on. - Never mind. We'll manage. - Not - Listen! - Now what did you say? - What? - You want me to fight all alone? - I don't want to get bashed up. - We don't even know who they are. - I know. She's the one. What?! She's... The girl of your dreams! Yes! Is she the one?! And you let her walk away! What a hopeless Romeo! You haven't even been introduced! Come on! On the bike! We thought the hoods might be back... Consider us your bodyguards? We'll manage. No. We're coming with you. Ever since we were boys, we've been protecting girls. Over here. Me...? The policeman is calling you. Go over. Where are you going? Where is the entourage headed? Who is she? His sister. What's your sister's name? Madhumohini. - And what's your name? - Madhumohan. Who is she? His sister. What's your sister's name? Chandramohini. - And what's your name? - Chandramohan. And why are you silent? Is she your sister? No. She's the girl I love. Is he saying the truth? Who is he? I don't know. Do you know that one? I don't know. And the other one? I don't know. Do you know who I am? Yes. You're my brother. I'll beat you so badly, you'll even treat your wife like a sister! There's been trouble. Some boys were teasing your sister. I'll beat the daylights out of you! Prithvi! What are you doing? You have no idea what your daughter has been up to! - I'll ask her. - You haven't even asked her. - I'm asking her. - Ask her? With whose permission did she go for a film? Shut up. I'll ask! Had it not been for me, your daughter would've... gone pillion-riding! Quiet! Prithvi! Quiet! Vicky! What's wrong with him? He won't even listen to me! - Don't hurt Pallavi. - You don't know what... - she has been up to. - You needn't tell her anything. Pallavi has told us everything. She has not done anything. He won't listen! Some hoods were after them. You don't believe? Pallavi, he wants to hear it from you. Come on. Il swear by the soul of my father 1 have done nothing wrong. And I never will do anything to make my father sad. I swear. I swear. It's all right. Don't cry. You believe her now, don't you? Go back to your studies. Why are you standing here? Go on... go away. - Tell me, who were they? - Why? I'd like to leave my mark on them. Never mind. I've beaten them up badly. That was a policeman at work. My account is yet to be settled. They live in Ashok Nagar. With some Colonel. Listen! No broken bones. Give them a discount. Who is the one? Which one is in love with my sister? Another one. Which one of you said he is in love with Vikram Sinh's sister? We. Not them! I had said that. I know it was my mistake. For that I apologize. But if you want to create a scene over this... I can say it again. My boys! Someone is roughing up my boys! Run! That fellow is mad! Stop! Calm down! They have gone away! They attacked you! If someone was shot, there would've been trouble. So what? I can get away with killing! No court is going to hang me. How come? I'm mad! Look, how much they beat you! Hurry. Get some medicines. Here's the money. Take it. Take it, I said. Go and see the doctor. Go on. All of you. Why get into fights? All this violence. Where is this country headed? To the hospitals. But it isn't our fault. It's all because of him. He was in love. And he told his girl's brother about it. What's wrong with that? Is it a crime to be in love? The girl's brother is an animal. Haven't you been to the police? How could we? That fellow is a police Inspector. A bastard of the first order! The devil incarnate! The hood who did this latest, also turned out to be another brother. Now what's his name? That cur! Not Vikram Sinh? The same. Thank your stars you're alive. The two have yet another brother. And he's dangerous. - He's a doctor. - A doctor? Yes. A doctor. His name is Suraj Sinh. Suraj Sinh? - I've read the name somewhere. - Not somewhere. Right here. On the sign outside. So how do you feel? Burns. That'll last for five minutes. Afterwards, you're going to be on fire! I told you not to get into it. The shot he gave us would kill an elephant! I'm burning all over! Where did you find this one?! Her brothers are all terrorists! And they seem to be everywhere! Let go of her! What?! Not so easily! Not after the beating we've taken! At least we have to square the deal with her brothers! You want to square the deal! The start with the first one. - That one... what's his name? - Prithvi Sinh. Yes. The one with the moustache. Let's start with him. 1 have an ideal - A game! Hide and seek! - Hide and seek? Yes! The game about the missing man! Missing! Let's lodge a complaint. That'll scare him. Let's post Lallan as missing. And we'll implicate the cop. You're lucky I'm on your side. I just want Pallavi. We've been through all this just because of your love-life! Now you must have an affair with her. If she falls in love with you, we'll have had our revenge. Can you do it? Sure. They were screaming in pain! No injections! You did the right thing. Gave the Romeos what they deserve. But Prithvi... what you did was not right. I did whatever I had to. I beat the daylights out of them. And then you wanted to hit Pallavi. What? Who did that? You hit her?! Hit my sister? How could you do that?! Daddy used to love her so much! What was it he used to say? "My Pallo is our princess" Have you forgotten the word we gave our father? We had said we'd protect our sister. Like soldiers. Have you forgotten that? What use your tears? Apologize to her. All right. I'll apologize to her. Well said! I'll call Pallavi. Pallo, come here. Hurry. I have hurt you. I'm sorry. You need not say that. Don't say that. Say you have forgiven me. Please. Till you smile, there will not be any happiness in our house. Smile, my princess. For once. You should tickle her. Kids, you must get your Aunt to smile. We'll get you food everyday. This place is deserted. The only ones who come here are ghosts. You'll have to take care of ghosts yourself. - You can do it. - You're scaring him. There are no ghosts. It's superstition. You'll be fine. All right. But Daddy is going to be worried. We'll handle that. - Sir, have you summoned me? - Yes. Did you beat 3 boys in custody on the 4th of this month? Sir... the matter is... No use fumbling. Two college students and a constable witnessed it. The boys were teasing a girl. Have you noted it in a formal complaint? Where's the report? One of the boys is missing. - Missing?! - Yes. This is his father. He's a retired judge. - And this is Colonel... - Nair. - Yes, Nair. They allege that you assaulted Lallan in custody. And they suspect you've hidden him away. That's a liel Get this clearly. I may be retired. But I still have my contacts. If I don't find my son soon enough... I'll make sure disciplinary action is taken. If you don't find Lallan in a week, you're sacked. What are you staring at me for? Come here. Excuse me. What is it? Where is your missing friend? No idea. Don't you act smart with me. Just tell me. You don't know where your friend is? We in the police know how to make the likes of you talk. I can make you talk. Want me to do that to you? Maybe you don't? Then just tell me. Try. You'll get to know. - What did you say? - Enough is enough! Someone is dead! Don't make a joke out of it! Who is dead? Not dead. It was murder! - Murder? - Yes! You were brutal. You hit him on the head. Again and again. Poor fellow. He died of a hemorrhage. What are you saying?! And after that, you dumped his body in your jeep, and you took him away. We'll drag you to the Supreme Court. And if need be, we'll present his remains as evidence. Now I know! You're cunning! You've got it all worked out, haven't you? Coming down to plainspeak... Can't we have a cease-fire? Possible. - I'm willing if you're ready. - Great! Now we're friends! Someday, we must go for a hunt together. Hunting is fun, you know. But first, we have to discover Lallan. That's the problem, you know. We're off for the hunt the very next day. Don't worry about Lallan. He's fine. That I knew. But where is he? Some place where he won't be found. We're friends now, aren't we? You'll tell me, won't you? I wouldn't tell your father. Neither you. Suraj! I'm in deep trouble! - 1 might lose my job!? - Why, what's up? One of those boys is missing. His father is accusing me of murder. He says I've dumped the corpse. Inder is behind all this. I know that. He's getting even with me. He has the fellow hidden away. In which case you should accost him. 1 tried to reason with him. 1 threatened him. But he won't wilt?! Said he wouldn't even tell my father! What did you say?! Did he insult our father? You heard him say it! And you didn't do anything! You should've killed him! The devil! Shut up! He's going to aggravate the situation! Don't you worry. I'll do what needs to be done. My job is at stake! Let it bel How dare he insult our father! I'll make sure he's crippled! Please! Try to reason with him! No, Vicky. The matter is already out of hand. He might lose his job. Please leave us alone. Go inside. Prithvi is about to lose his job. Why make a cripple out of Inder? Just kill him. So that's your tension? Not tense. But when I think of I, I feel it was all because of us. How come? We approached them. We had asked them to speak to us. So what? We just talked to them. How could he say something like that? In love with you! That's what I don't understand. Why did he say such a thing? Madness. What else? By the way, what's his name? Indrajeet Bansal. The pet name is Inder. Look! He's coming. - Let's get away! - No. I'll wait. I'm leaving! I don't want to annoy you. I don't want to hurt you. I want apologize. It was my mistake. No use being shy about this. We've met, maybe seen each other, two or three times. And that's about as much as you know me. But I don't know why I feel as if I've known you for years. But I didn't want to annoy you. She's so lovingly simple! So charming! So disarming! What I said is the truth. 'm sorry if I hurt you. Please! Stop! Where have you hidden your friend? Why did you do such a thing? - What have I done? - How do I say this? Look, we're talking as equals. Let me apologize to you too. Please do not be angry. Please ask your friend to show up. Please! I request you! And please forget everything. The mistake was mine. And my friends had to suffer. They want revenge. How can I stop them? But now that you're asking me, I'll try. Whatever I can. Listen... You asked me to forget everything. I'll do that too. I'll forget everything. But how can I forget the face of the girl I've given my heart to? I cannot forget you. Never. Must you scare me?! 1 nearly had a heart attack!?! Only joking! What news? Anything hot? News is it's all over. You can come out. The hide and seek is over. But why? Pallavi came to me. She pleaded with me. This fellow was supposed to be suspended! What about it? That isn't necessary. Pallavi came to me. - What more do you want? - I don't care. That fellow is a devil! I'm not coming out till he is suspended! Try to understand. If he's suspended... I'll lose Pallavi forever. If he isn't suspended... Pallavi will surely be mine. Someday. You fell for her words! A woman's words! Never trust a woman! Women pretend! All of them do! Had he been suspended for even an hour...! Do you remember how he bashed us up? You promised me you'd do anything to help me get Pallavi. Remember? Then do what I say. And Pallavi will be mine. - Sure? - Absolutely! Inder has a point. That's why we are here. But if she's playing a game, we aren't with you. Remember that. If I'm wrong, I'll do whatever you want me to. Promise? Promise. Kids! Look what I've got for you! This is for you... this is for you... Mummy, this is for you. For me? And this is for you. - And this one? - For my brother. For you and Vicky. Very nice! What's the occasion? The threat has blown over. What do you mean? That boy I was accused of killing. 1 played a neat game. He came walking. And he presented himself. He even wrote a note apologizing for the incident. 1 had given him a good beating. And he wrote that I didn't even touch him! Bloody coward! His father was begging. He wanted the case closed. Now they know what Prithvi Sinh is made of! Not worth losing sleep over. Say what Mummy? You're the one who lost sleep. Not I This was minor. I saw you carrying the presents... and I thought you had done something great! Yesterday, you were going around with your tail between your legs. Well, enjoy yourself. Fine. Then give my gift back. Give it to your wife. It isn't my class, anyway. That tail was between your legs yesterday! I want to thank you for asking your friend to show up. I was looking for you. At last I've met you. Listen... Pallavi, at home you might be considered a kid. But you aren't. And you can take decisions for yourself. 1 have said this once. I love you. But you have never replied. Give me an answer. You must. - 1 don't know these things... - If you like me, say yes. If you don't like me, just say it. I don't know all these... Does that mean you love me? No...1 In that case, I'll take it that you don't love me. But why? So you love me! Right? When did I say that? Okay, so you don't love me. I'm leaving. Give me an answer. Can I tell you tomorrow? All right. Listen! Don't lie to me tomorrow! I know you mean yes. I'll wait for you. Now who has made my princess so sad? Everyone says you've been looking off-color the last three days. What's the matter? Tell me. It's nothing. If any of us has done anything... No. But why are you so glum? I'm fine. You are the light of this house. If you stay glum, you'll make everyone sad. No one has said anything to me. It's true. She says it's nothing. Now don't bother her. Get up Go away. Let her study. All we want is for her to be happy. Well all right. Now go on. Come on. Are you cross because I took away Mummy's gift? But I returned it to her. The same evening. - It isn't that. - Not that, right? - No. - Then it's all right. No. I won't do this. I won't make anyone unhappy. Never. Didn't I tell you not to trust that girl?! You're satisfied now, aren't you? She's a fraud! Had that brother of hers been suspended.. We would've something to feel nice about. We let him off the hook. And now the girl has vanished. Much ado about nothing. Why nothing? We took a beating, didn't we? My Pallavi! Forget it. Spilt milk. And you forget her. No dearth of girls. Find another one. She's mine. I love her. And she loves me. She has cheated you! What are you staring at me for? You think you're going to scare me? Take it from me. She'll never to be yours. Now where is he off to? "It's been so long. Don't make me wait any longer." "Please give me an answer. Yes or no." "If you can't speak it, write to me. From your heart." You will never do anything wrong. I know it. And I know you won't tell me a lie. But I have to ask you. Did you call him here? Vicky... Did you call him here? No... but... That will be enough. I understand. I understand everything. Don't you touch him! Leave me! Let go! Don't hit him! Leave him, I say! Cur! He walked into my house and he gave my sister a dirty note! My sister cried when she told me that he's making her life miserable! What am I supposed to do?! What would you do if I messed around with your sisters? Will you sit and watch the fun? This matter doesn't end here. Come on. - Take him to a doctor! - No one touches him! We'll take care of him. Go away. Whatever Vicky said was a lie! Then why didn't she give you a reply? Why didn't she come to see you? How did the letter reach her brother? She's deceiving you! Maybe you're right. Promise me you won't see her any more. Don't even think about her. Promise me. I promise. Who are you? Where do you think you're going? Stop! Hands up! You must be Colonel Nair! I've read about you. Nice to see you! - Hands up! - But please don't shoot! What's your name? My name? Yes, Satish Kumar Bansal. - That's too long. Make it short. - What? - Satish Kumar - Shorter! - Satish? - Shorter! - Stop! - Uncle Nair! That'd be a mistake! He's Inder's father. I seel I heard about you! At last, we meet! No hair on your head? Please put that down. Else I'll lose the few I have! How are you? - Alive. How are you? - The same. - Put that in your pocket! - Don't worry! It isn't loaded! No bullets! Go on! Come, Uncle. It was loaded! Just one bullet. One of these days, someone is going to die! What happened? How did this happen? Some people bashed me up. Bashed you? Who did that? Who has dared to touch you? Tell me. No. The mistake was mine. I deserved it. Just don't ask me anything about it. I just want to forget everything about it. Does it hurt? I'll be all right. Come with me. Let's go home right away. No! I don't want Mummy to see me in this condition. And you mustn't tell her anything. You won't, will you? I won't. Once I'm all right, I'll come home. This is the end of my education. I'll do whatever she wants. Tell her that. But why? Don't you know your mother? She wants for you what you want for yourself. It's the same with me. You want to study, don't you? Go on. Please do. You're going to be fine. But I won't leave that scoundrels! No! Let's not think about it anymore! It's over! Can I stay with you for a few days? You can't do that! Mummy will be worried. Very well. We'll take care of ourselves. And you take care of yourself. Sure. Stop. So what do you think of yourself? You had him beaten up so badly. And now you're off to college, are you? All Inder wanted to know was whether you love him. Was that so wrong? If you didn't want to write to him... you could've thrown the letter in his face! The least you could do was to tell him you don't like him! You think you can do anything just because your brothers are goons? Look... Inder's father. Who were the ones who beat my son? - We don't know. - You know! You don't want to tell me? We don't know. That's the truth. Lies! You're lying! Tell met Who's the one who hurt my son?! Tell me! We don't know. Don't be sorry! Tell met It's true. We don't know. Who were they?! Tell met Tell met - It's the truth! We don't know. - I know. You know who hit my son! I know! You call yourselves friends! Shame on you! You watched on while he took the beating! Shame on you! Heard that?! Inder is his only son! If we told him, he would've hacked your brothers to pieces! Go away. No one is going to harass you ever again. Inder will never see you again. Go away. Inder still lives in hope. That's why he asked us not to tell his father. Forget it. She's stone-hearted. No use talking to her. Go away. - Forget her. - Get lost! I want to... No! Don't say anything. I don't want to listen to you. Hear me out! Please! I said I don't want to. I have gotten over it. I don't want to remember anything. I want to say... I know what you want to say! That you never gave that letter to your brother! He just chanced upon it. That you never even imagined this would happen. And now you want to apologize. Right? - No. - What else? I wanted to tell you... I like you. No! I don't believe you. You must. Believe me. 1 am telling the truth. Really? So when are you taking me home for introductions? Will you be able to say it with the same conviction... that you love me... you want me for yourself? I might not... I might not be able to say it in words. Then stop this farce and go away. I haven't forgotten this address. 1 thought all I had to do was to say yes or no. But I never imagined these circumstance would arise. Our lives are so different. I know that. And I know it's difficult for us to come together. But now I'm ready to face any situation. Once my brothers have calmed down, I'll tell them everything. They might not concede. But for my sake, they will. I know that. But as of now, I cannot tell them what you want me to. If after all this, I still have no place in your heart... I'll leave. Shall I leave? I'm leaving. Why was she here? What new game is she up to? What's her new plan? She came here to say she's in love with me. She said that? Not once. She said it over and over again. And she cried. And what did you tell her? What could I have said? You've forbidden me. I'm not even supposed to think about her. I kept my promise to you, friends. And she walked away? Did you mean what you said? What? That you love Inder? Yes. Sit on the bike. Here. Here she is. For you. Now I know that she's saying the truth. I wouldn't let a friend be weighed down under a promise. You're free now. True love is something that comes from the heart. Don't say this just to make me happy.- Inder, you know me. Tell me, can I ever cheat you? Do we exit now? If you want us to. If you say so, we can stay back. - No. Let's exit. - No. We stay. - So we stay. - No. I said we go. Inder, why don't you say something? Let Pallavi have her say. You call this romance? Romance we will. But after you've got lost! The mad fellow! He's after the dog again! What happened? Either the Colonel has gone mad again. Or it's confetti from the heavens! It's late. Can I leave now? Sure. So when do we meet again. Whenever you want. The fort on top of the hill? Do you know the place? We can meet there. The place with a lot of wild grass? Yes. That's the place. Come in. Lovely place. Very romantic. We should all meet there. Not all of us. Just the two of us. Where does that leave the two of us? Pallavi is getting late. Who's going to drop her at the station? - May I... I'm the one who brought her here. I get to drop her. You brought her here. I drop her. Come on, Pallavi. What right have you? Who's she to you? My sister. What's your sister's name? Chandramohini. - And you? - Chandramohan. And who is she to you? She's the girl I love. Is that true? I'll drop her. No one else. But... It's late. Let me drop you home. I know you're very brave. You needn't prove it. Go on. I'll manage. Listen... I'll take it the next time. Will she make it? I think she said it in a state of shock. I don't think she's coming. He's such a misfit anyway. Had you just kissed her once, she would've come running to you. I told you she isn't coming. She will come. Hear that? Inder says, so she will! Inder is omniscient! He can read her mind! For the last time, she isn't coming! She's here! It's her first date with you. She must remember this day all her life. Make sure you do something appropriate. Appropriate? What? The exam is about to begin! And you're still asking questions! A kiss! A long and lovely kiss. Hold her and smooch! You insist on taking care of it to the last kiss. Maybe I should leave? - What's going on? - Let's go for a holiday. Far away. They just walked past me. And they didn't even notice me! As if they don't even know us. Maybe they don't want to disturb us. In there. In the shade! Don't just chatter! Make our day! What's happening? Stones. What? He's playing with stones! It's going to rain today. But there are no clouds. There was a forecast. It's going to rain. Do you listen to the weather forecast? No. I don't either. Just saw it on TV yesterday. Do you have a TV at home? A color TV? Or a black and white? Both. Earlier we had a black and white set. But my brothers have given us a color TV. You're scared of your brothers, aren't you? Not scared. But whenever I think about them, I get nervous. I know they will concede. Everything will be all right. I have faith in them. They love me very much. Me too. I want to tell you something too. But I don't know... I know what you want to tell me. Say "Me too". Me too. What are they doing? - They are laughing. - What? He must have told her that silly old joke. I have a feeling this girl is going to dump him after all. What was I saying? - The rains? - Yes. The rains. Even the grass flowers during the rains. Did you know that? - The grass? - Yes. - Have you seen grass seeds? - No. - I'll show you. - Never mind. It's worth seeing. - They are as pretty as flowers. - Really? Don't do it. There might be thorns! Are they doing anything? Yes. They're catching butterflies. - Butterflies - Oh yes! Trying out romance! Come on. Stop! Stop! Please! Enough! In this age of rock, you're stone-aged! We were talking about so many things! This is romance. Not entertainment for the audience! - Now aren't we friends? - Yes. - We wish you well, don't you? - Yes. And the two of you have so many things to tell each other? - Yes. - But you cannot express it. Here. - Here you are. - What is this? - Blank paper. - What do I do with this? - The day today. Monday? - Yes. - So tomorrow is Tuesday? - Yes. Go on. Put the words on paper. See you tomorrow. Come on, boys. - What have you written? - Lots and lots. Only you can understand it. What have you written? About as much as you'll be able to understand. Show me. One minute! Wait! Give that to me. Now it can't get lost. What are you doing?! Listen! We've been serving sentry duty for long enough. You're going to hide nothing from us. Ms Pallavi. Your letter please. Now we face off and read it out aloud. Don't read it like news. Use a bit of romance. To that effect. What's in yours? Nothing. Blanked out. Mine too. White, as if it's just been dry cleaned. How come mine is whiter than yours? Let's ask them. Aren't you ashamed? We got bashed, landed in trouble... just so that the two of you get together. And the two of you can't even romanticize! If this is your romance, you should rather sit at home. The two of you have made fools out of us. The friendship is over. - Come on, Lallan. - Come. - Listen Lallan. - We don't want to. Where are you going? They walked out on us! Why are they cross? - Nice act. - Right? Now he's going to kiss her. I think they want... me to touch you. How? Maybe I could touch your lips. Why? Maybe they want me to kiss you. No! Don't do that. I'm going to run away! I'm going to kiss you! Pallavi! Stop! The chance of the day! Don't let her slip!? Get her? Get her! Hold her tight! Lallan! Stop him! Stop! Not! Don't stop him! Let him! Let him beat me as much as he wants to! Don't hurt him! 1 belong to him! He's mine! Wait! Please don't leave like this! Listen to me! Don't hate me! You can hate someone who is alive. For me you are dead! I have no sister! Not hate you! I have nothing but hatred for you! And when my brothers come to know of this... they will hate you even morel Your mother will hate you too! Inder! What's going to happen now? I didn't imagine this would happen! What am I going to do now? How can I go back home? I can't face my mother! I can't bear this! I'm not going home! What's the matter, Vicky? What happened? Tell met What happened? She is gone. The princess has gone away. What are you saying?! How...? Had it been anyone else, I wouldn't have been so unhappy. But this I cannot tolerate! Had it not been for Prithvi, I would have broken his bones! Why did he have to stop me? Stop talking in riddles. What is it? She clung to Inder! And she said she's his! She loves him? She said that to me!? - Pallavi? She said that? - Yes. She will not step into this house. Not without him! Why are you standing like morons? If she has gone away, let her go! Let her die! She doesn't care for you! Why are you crying?! It's all the result of pampering! You pampered her! Now see the result! Throw away all her belongings! Get rid of everything that bears her mark! I don't want her! I don't want a daughter like that! Burn everything that reminds us of her! The light has gone out of our lives! Let her go away! But that scoundrel! He took our Pallavi away from us! I'll hack him to pieces! Any news? - They've burnt everything. - Burnt? - They've disowned Pallavi. - What is going to happen now? They were planning. - A plane? - No! A helicopter! Shut up! - Did you understand anything? - No. Neither I. Then came the younger brother. Everyone accepted this plan. It's dangerous! I'm not getting involved! Do what you have to do! Now have you had enough? I told you... Why must 1? And why didn't you go? What's up? Bad news. They have disowned Pallavi. They've burnt all her belongings. What?! And now they are up to something. What? That's what we can't understand. - That madcap! - That's beside the point. Whatever they do, it's surely going to be something drastic. It could be dangerous for you to stay here. The two of you should get away. This is Indian champagne. Who is it? Cur! Come out! And who are you? Inder isn't at home. What is the matter? We have come to see those parents.. Who have fed their son with animal feed! And have raised him like an ass! To fulfill his stupid needs... keep a few more asses like him! So that idiot can have company! What nonsense is this?! You haven't yet told me what this is all about! Your son has eloped with my sister! She was like a daughter to me! That scoundrel! He has seduced my sister. And now they're hiding! I don't want my sister back! For us, she's dead! But get this one thing! We'll hunt your son down! And we'll kill him like a dog! Remember that! And we'll do it right in front of your eyes if we have to! Everybody... please be seated. No, I mean if there's a problem... No. Please be seated. Excuse me... What's happening? We must look for him. To what end?! Didn't you hear?! He has eloped with her He's hiding! Where do I look for him?! And why should 1?1 Let him go wherever he wants! He'll come here when he tires out. Then we'll see. But they could hurt Inder. Let them! If what they say is true, then he deserves it. Now why do you have to be sad? I'm the one who should be feeling sorry. It's all my fault! I treated him like an equal. Not as a son. And this is the result. Did you hear how that fellow was talking? Does that not tell you where this girl comes from? Where she belongs! But my Inder would never do such a thing! How could he?! Neither do . But... Well then, tell me what you want me to do. I'll do it. You don't stay in this city for another minute! They are in a murderous rage. They are beating up everyone. The two of you look nice together. But it's so scary. This could lead to a tragedy. Either of you... There's still time. You could still change your minds. No. There won't be any tragedy. We're going home. To my parents. We are getting married. Move it then, Right now. In the car. Come along. Only you. - But Pallawvi? - 1 know. And that's why I want you to come alone. But without Pallavi...? What about it? I'm not coming. There is someone at home who wants to find a girl for you. And right now, she's praying for your life! Never in my life have I hurt your mother! And I won't have you do this to her! She's miles apart from the girl your mother would want for you. Daddy! I beg of you! I won't come without Pallavi! You're coming with me! As far as this girl is concerned... they will dump her at her house! Take her away! Don't you touch her! Leave me! Let go! I'll kill you! Kill me! Go on! No, Inder! You mustn't raise your hand against your father! I'll go away. Hold on... - Are you coming? Or aren't you? - Not She's my love! And I will take her home to my mother! I'm going nowhere without her! You will. And you will come alone. If you truly love your mother... if you are a true son to your mother... you will be home by tonight. And you will leave her. Otherwise, even if her brothers end up killing you... I won't shed a tear. You will come. Make sure you do. You'll come, won't you? Where do you go from here? Stop staring like zombies and come home with me. I'll give you a taste of hospitality. I haven't a palace. Just a little shanty. My father is a poor fisherman. But at heart, he's a lion. He'll stand by me. He's big at heart. I'll take you home. No one can touch you there. Daddy, get a hold on yourself. You've drunk too much. Listen to me, will you? Who are you? Oh Peter! My son! When did you come? I never even noticed! Drink like a fish, and you hear nothing and you see nothing! Now come on. My friends are with me. My son's friends! Where are they? I don't see them! My son's friends! Where are you? Over there. That friend of yours looks like a girl. Not like one. She is a girl. A girl! This is Pallavi. And this is my friend Inder. They want to marry. - Not married yet? - No. Look here, Uncle... Looks like Peter is in trouble. I think he wants to tell you something. Inder is in love with this girl. The girl loves him too. But their families are against it. They are going to come here too. Hey folks... This boy and this girl are staying here. Any problems? Any hassles. - None. Then rest assured. No one can take you away from here. But you have to promise me that the two of you will stay together. We are poor. But we are proud. And our pride is at stake. Sure. We promise we'll be together all our lives. We will never separate. From this day... these kids are ours! Some people are coming here. In jeeps. Driving like savages. Some people are here to take a look-see. Let's give them a warm welcome. Where's Peter's house? Know where Peter's house is? Where's Pinto's house? Peter's father. Keep working, guys! Where is Pinto? Can't hear me, can you? Right here. What do you want? A boy and a girl. Your son has brought them here. Where are they? We'll dump the girl. But that bastard! We're going to kill them! That's my shack. The kids are in there. Go on. Take them away. You dogs! Come on! Have you got it in you?! Let's see who has the guts to take our kids away! Stop behaving like savages! All we want is that boy and that girl. They have eloped. Is that so? You aren't going to resort to violence, are you? We do what we want to! Who are you to question us?! Bastards! Hiding them, are you? Bring them out! The boy and the girl came to us asking for help. They're nice kids. How can we throw them out? If this is going to be a show of strength, so be it. Let's see who drags them out. Bring them out! Else you'll die a horrible death! Do it, kid. Shut up and do it. They have touched Jojo Uncle! Cut their hands off! Stop it! Stop it I say! Stop! Hold on, everyone! No outsider has ever won a fight on this beach. We have cut off the hands that have dared to rise against us! That is history! Two innocent kids. In love. They have come to us seeking refuge. They can stay here as long as they want to. As long as I am alive, you cannot touch them. Bring the kids here. Touch them if you dare! Dumbstruck, are you?! Bloody dogs! Touch them if you dare! All right. We will never touch them. For us, you are an untouchable! You are the reason why we've had to go through this! When we saw you, we thought you would come running to us! - That's what we thought. - Enough! No more! You will cry! You will beg! But our doors are closed for you. Forever! You have no place in our lives! Not at home! Not in our hearts! No use talking to the dead! Come on! Come on! What are you staring at? Get back to work. Don't worry, little girl. Go where you want to. Go find a place for yourself. A place where there is peace of mind. - What's on your mind? - Nothing. About your brothers? My mother. My brothers. Everyone. Uncle Jojo abused your brothers in front of you. That was too much! You thought they would accept us in the end. Do you still think so? No. It's all over. They will accept us. There's only one person who can understand us. Who? Mummy It was Daddy who said all that. But if I beg my mother for you, she'll relent. 1 think I should see her. - Now? - Yes. - Will you go alone? - Yes. But I won't tell these people about it. Else they won't let me leave. I'll be back as soon as I can. Maybe with Mummy. Don't go alone, Inder. I'm so scared. It's going to be all right. Don't stop me. I'm going. Say you'll be back! Have you dropped her home? I want to know! No. Then why are you here? I want to see my mother. - You cannot. - 1 will? If Mummy says she won't see me, if she doesn't want to meet Pallavi... if she doesn't want to see me happy, I'll go away. You won't see your mother until you've severed ties with that girl. I'd like my mother to say that. Aren't you ashamed?! Some girl you met yesterday means more to you than... the woman who bore you! What use seeing your mother? 1 have to see her... I must?! I know she will agree! - Your mother won't! - If she does... I don't have to care for anyone else! Not even you! - She doesn't want to see you! - I don't believe you! - I told you so! - What are you doing, Daddy? - Get out of here! - What's going on? Why are you so adamant, Inder? You cannot see me till you have left her. That is what I told your father. What he has told you is what I have decided. Beg me if you want. But you cannot change my mind. Why don't you understand, Inder?! This is a disaster! We can't condone that! What we have decided is for your sake! You are lost, my son! But there is still time! Any longer, and you'll reach the point of no-return. Apologize to her. And send her home. No, Mummy. A son loves no one more than his mother. I love you. Pallavi loves her mother and her brothers too. She has left everything behind. For my sake. How can I abandon her? But if you will not accept it, 1 have no right to stay here. I'm leaving. Inder! I won't let you go! - Don't stop me! - You can't! - Please! Let me go! - 1 won't let you go! - What are you doing?! - Stop! Inder! Come home! - Don't go away! - Let go of him! You're behaving like a child! Let him go! We aren't sending him away. He's leaving us. He's an adult. He must decide for himself. Let him go. Why are you looking at me like that? Have I said anything wrong? Don't worry. I know Inder. He will send her home. And he is going to come back to us. He will. There is going to be trouble if you aren't careful. Her brother is a policeman. He'll complain in court. For holding a woman against her will. He'll have all of you thrown in jail. So tell me man, what are we supposed to do? A marriage. Let's have the marriage registered. Once the marriage is registered... neither the police nor the courts can do anything. Can we get the registrar of marriages here? How many registrars do you want? Tomorrow, I'll get you one. Trussed up, if I have to. - That okay? - Perfect Here you are. - What is it? - A wedding dress. A gift from friends. Get ready, Inder. The marriage registrar is coming. Once this marriage is done, we will get some breathing space. What are you waiting for? Get the flowers. Go on. Shall I get dressed? Will you sit beside me for a while? You look sad. You don't look happy either. I've seen it in you. Yes. I think I know. What is happening to us? I don't know. Are you unhappy about the marriage? No. It's just that I would've liked my mother and my brothers... to be with me at this moment. That is what I wanted. You are right. I wanted my parents to be here too. Why are they doing this to us? Have we committed so grave a sin? We didn't do anything intentionally. It just happened. Won't they forgive us? They won't. They are possessive. Maybe that's why. What did your mother tell you yesterday? Mummy said she won't allow a disaster to happen. She is right. To be refused by the one she loves most... her son. What could hurt her more? Can I ask you something? Go on. Should we... should we separate? Yes. What did you say?! Yes. That is just what I said. My Pallavi must be happy. Always. For my sake, you must never be unhappy. You love me very much, don't you? You too? Me too. You'll go back home, won't you? I will. You must ask your mother to forgive me. I will. Tell her that I've given her son back to her. I will. Now I'm not unhappy anymore. You aren't unhappy, are you? Neither you. Promise? Promise. Call the kids. - The registrar is here. - All right. Peter... get the kids here. - Are we having a party tonight? - Sure. Please be seated, sir. - A cold drink, sir? - No. Where are the kids? Call them. Hurry. What is this?! They aren't ready! We don't want to marry. We are breaking up. Have you decided not to marry? Yes. It's mutual. What nonsense is this? You didn't even ask them! Why did you put me through all this trouble? Please wait, sir! They don't want to marry. What's your worry? I tried to bring you together. You made a promise, didn't you? Didn't you?! They why? What is all this about? I don't understand a thing! Not a thing! You shouldn't have insulted me like this! This is wrong! Very wrong of you! I will not let you do this! Never! You have deceived us! And we lost sleep over you! You understand me. You do. Not a word! I don't want to hear a word! You've insulted us in front of everyone! Just like a true friend! You should have told me it's like this! I wouldn't have brought you here! You know how much Inder loves me. More than you, we grieve this. We have people at home. They are good folks. And they love us. Just as you do. They have raised us with great expectations. They have hopes for us. They have their dreams. Is it right of us to be so selfish? Can you hurt your family? Could you do this to your father? Inder loves me very much. That's why he is sending me back. We are sacrificing our loves for the sakes of our families. You should support us. I haven't a father. You have been like a father to me. Give me your blessings. And please send me home. I am the one who should be apologizing. I understand! Now I understand you! Blessed are your parents! To have good children like you! Bless them! I was taken aback when I heard you. But now...l salute your decision. What a lesson for every child! I cannot say more. You are adults. You are mature. Maybe more mature than your years. Never mind all that. Do whatever you feel best. Go on. Inder, I hit you. Forgive me, my friend. - Forgive me! - Not What are you saying?! Go on. Drop Pallavi home. I'm leaving. You'll drop by to see me sometimes, won't you? What is it, Suraj? We have the court order. That scoundrel! He's going to be jailed! And we'll drag Pallavi home! Drag her, where? Don't you make the mistake of bringing her here! She mustn't step inside this house! Send her to a home for destitute. The doors of this house are closed for her. Forever. I swear by the soul of our father. I am pure. In body. And in soul. 1 have not sinned. 1 have left it all behind. Forgive me I knew! You'd never do anything wrong! I know you'll never hurt us. But what came over you? Why did you do such a thing? Won't you forgive me? Oh, but you're the light of this family! You needn't say anything. My daughter is come home! My darling! 1 told you? Inder would come back!? Here he is! Forgot Daddy, did you? Forgot your Daddy! - Daddy, it hurts. - Hurts, does it? And what about me? What about the way you hurt me? You had me scared! Now will you ever leave me?! You're going nowhere! Find a boy! And get her married. As soon as you can. As soon as you can! Pallavi's marriage is the most important item on the agenda. - How can we rush into this? - I don't caret! She must be married off! The sooner the better! She jokes with you. She sings with you. But the fire still burns within her. Unless the fire is quenched... I can never rest in peace. Keep that in mind. Just tell me which of these you like. Don't ask me. And don't ask anyone else. The girl you choose is going to be the best for me. I know that. This is tough! Listen... sit here. - What is it? - Help me choose a girl. No. You must do it. It's your prerogative. He even asked you not to ask anyone. Now, how do I... Wait... I haven't seen Pallavi. You saw her. See if you can find someone like her. As far as I am concerned, she's going to be good enough. Our son has given his heart to Pallavi. There's only one reason why he left her. He loves you more than he loves her. If you want to reciprocate... you must find him a girl better than Pallavi. And remember, it's your duty. - What is the matter, Suraj? - We have won the day! We can have our sister married off as soon as you please! Thank God! You have answered my prayers! The boy is brilliant. You are lucky, Pallavi. Now who is he? Words of praise aren't enough for him! He's coming to see our princess. You can meet him for yourself. He will surely like our princess. And Pallavi will like him too. All that is left is the formal introduction. When is that? Next Sunday. At last we have found a prince for our princess! Look at her! The princess is shy! This chain belongs to Pallavi. How do I give it back to her? Pallavi is getting married. We just got to know. The fellow is an engineer settled in America. After the marriage, Pallavi is going to settle in America. Come here. I want Inder to marry before that girl does. Why? Can't I go there to return the chain? Why? I want to see Pallavi. I want to see the girl who won my son's heart. Pallavi. I want to meet her. Once. You even told me that I must find a better girl. Please take me over. We have an excuse. This chain. And then I'll find a better girl for our Inder. Take me there. Please. Good morning. May we come in? We heard about a marriage. Pallavi had a necklace. It was lying with Inder. We just got to know. So we thought we would return the chain. And I'd like to apologize for the inconvenience Inder has caused you. Oh that was minor. Please step inside. The other day we were very upset. And we spoke to you very rudely. I wanted to apologize to you for it. Please step in. Inder's parents. Why, you're still standing. Please be seated. Please be seated. Please come with me. Sit down, children. Welcome. Please be seated. Go on. Attend the guests. Pallavi... get some sherbet for the guests. Sit down. Please. You are the first guests since the marriage was announced. Is the date decided? What? The date of the marriage? No. The boy is in a hurry. Maybe by next Thursday. They have just arrived from America. This chain belongs to Pallavi. Inder had it. My son was very foolish. He put you through a lot of trouble. 1 apologize for him. Please forgive him. Why bring up bygones? It was trouble for both of us. 1 pray to God for the strength that we may forget it all. I have not even seen your son. Which one is he? Pallavi's mother wants to meet you. May you be happy. It wasn't Pallavi's fault. It was all my fault. 1 apologize. Don't say that. You have given my daughter back to us. I should be thanking you for this. You mustn't be unhappy. Whatever be the reasons, what has happened has happened. Pallavi insists that the first one to be invited to her marriage... must be your mother. Be seated. Please. Have you come to marry Aunt Pallavi? No. Then why are you here? Out! Get out of here. You will excuse us now... It was nice meeting all of you. Shall we... 1 shall be leaving. You did not even speak to my daughter. After you are gone, my daughter is going to break down. I won't be able to bear that. She is getting married. You will bless her, won't you? What am I to bless her with? With what words do I say it? She's my daughter! Why don't you give her to me?! 1 will take care of her? Give her to me! Please! Take her. Take her away. Let her have the man she wants. What did you say?! Yes. This only a mother can see. Do you not see how she holds back her tears? She wants this. Let it happen. - That's what I wanted to tell you! - Yes, Mummy! That's what I wanted to say too! My darling! I made you unhappy, didn't 17 I'd never find a better girl for Inder would 17 Never. Now what is it? What are you staring at me for? Go on. Ask for your girl! No. Never. You can't take her away just like that. We give her the send-off. Take good care of our sister. You have your bride. Nothing to stop you. Nothing to hold you back. You are free. And the world is yours! Why are you fellows standing there? You have a part to play, don't you? Come on.
