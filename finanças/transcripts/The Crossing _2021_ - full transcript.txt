I've been drawing all my life. My father gave me my first sketch book. Look. This was my home when I was little. This is my village, Novi Varna. People didn't have much. Actually, we had nothing. We did everything ourselves. But I had a home, a family. I was happy. Look, that's my mother, with my little sister. My father. The twins. Here, I'm thirteen. Adriel is twelve. Our village doesn't exist anymore. People ran away, many died. Him. And her. And them too. With all their children. That's the summer we left. It was a beautiful summer. Why are you scared? Mom didn't see us leave. I'm not scared of her but of the farmers. They hate us. So? They are eating right now. Kyona, wait for me! Hey you bumpkins... Release the dogs! It's not funny, Kyona. - Go home. - Without you? I'm not leaving you alone! Where are you going? - Don't mind me. - You are always mean to me. - Oh, come on. You don't get it. Adriel! Adriel! Get down. Why? What did you see? The dogs? - Hurry, it's burning! - Where? At home, it's burning! Take that! Is it because we stole the cherries? Is that it? No, don't be silly. Rummage everything, the house, the barn. In their gang of murderers, there were soldiers, militiamen, farmers with guns. They came to our village to destroy it. Their only reason was hate. They needed an enemy at all costs. We were the enemy. We didn't find anything, boss. - That's all you got? Are you kidding me? I know you've got gold somewhere. You Yelzids are all the same! You'll have to find your money for me, you understand? Take that! You vermin! You think you can fool us? You rats! It's a big mistake, Yelzid. A very big mistake. Let's get out of here! Watch out, I will deal with you and your family. We'll come back as many times as we need to and burn everything that's left. Animals, people, everything! They don't make the rules here. They think they can do anything they want... Vermin! Yelzid pigs! - Do you know him well? - He's my cousin. He lives on the other side of the border. The village is called Arcata. The train leaves from Novi Varna, and goes through Lower-Bathely. Then we arrive in the mountains. Then... - Then? - Then... There are smugglers, there must be smugglers. - Kyona, where are we going? - To his cousin, didn't you hear? Aren't you scared? - Why? We will be with our parents. Why don't we defend ourselves? Some people do that. I'm too old to fight. And we have the kids. We need to leave. We will do like everyone else does. Mom, I'm sleepy. Where are we going? Dad, where is my little knife? - Kyona, please help your brother. - Yeah, wait a second. Hurry up, you're too slow! Let's go! Kids, hurry up. What are you waiting for? For them to come back? Rock, paper, scissors. Rock, paper, scissors. Rock, papery scissors. - Wait for me! - Kyona, your brother! - Dad! Why always me? It's not fair! Can't you take care of yourself? That's how we left. My brother was trailing behind, my mom crying, my dad screaming. And I was so excited. I was leaving Novi Varna for the first time. And I was going to take the train. I had never seen so many people at once. They were coming from everywhere. Until then, I thought everyone was like us: white skin, black hair... Mom, who are they? - Ostelians. - Why are they here? They're out of water at home. Animals and children are dying. What about them? With the tattoos? Skanderbergs. At home, it's war. Everyone has his reasons. Dad! Dad! Nobody knows if we will be controlled or not. - Are there controls? - I'm talking to your mother. Controls... Everyone who was running away was counting on their luck. If that didn't work, they'd say they'd lost their papers, or they'd offer gold and jewellery. Daddy... Daddy... Don't cry... Let's go! Come on, hurry up! My mother was very strong. We didn't know how, but she always managed. That day, she got us all on the train. Control for everyone. - Don't be scared. - Get out of here! - Dad, what's going on? - Get your bags, get your papers ready! - Stay hidden! - Dad... - Shush! - Hurry up! - Get off at the last stop, wait for me in the station. - Get off! If we don't make it, make your own way, take your brother to Arcata. We'll meet there. - Mom! - Shush... Don't worry! Yelzids, out! - Children too. Your wife too! - You're the oldest. Take the map. You don't have papers? Come on, hurry up! You, you get down here right now! - Mom... Give me your papers! Faster! Everyone on the platform! Stemetsvar... I had never seen a city before... I'm telling you, they are coming. When? Get up! Get out of the way! What should we do, Kyona? I'm hungry... Kyona? - What now? - I'm tired. - Oh, shut up! My bag! My bag! Hey, stop! That's all we found. And this? - It's mine! - Who's that? She was under the arcades. With this boy. - You brought them? - They followed us. If the cops follow you, you bring them too? Give me the notebook. Did you draw this? It's beautiful. Adriel, let's go! - Where? - To the station, to look for my parents. You think you're gonna see your parents again? Soldiers took them for a control. But we kept going. And now... Now you are here, we will protect you. Right, guys? It could have been worse, you know? At first I thought it was just for a night. That they'd arrive the next day, and in the meantime, we were safe. What I didn't understand was that we had become street kids. Iskender understood. He understood a lot of things. That parents who got arrested never come back. Never by train anyway. I waited for them everyday at the station. I began to lose hope. Look, he is there! My brother had made friends. Six half-crazy scoundrels. - Take that, you crook! - With him that made seven. They called themselves "The ravens". What? - Nothing. - What nothing? - My parents, my family. - Don't talk about that here. Forget everything that happened before. Before is dead. - I can't. - But the others can. - I know... But my brother... - Your brother is fine. He isn't sitting on the floor, crying. He's working. It was true. Stealing was what he did best. Not that I wasn't worried, but at least I didn't have him in front of me. Huh, wow! Kyona, can I have some, please? - Always begging, these ones. You tramps! - Here, eat. Why are you giving it to them? All they do is take advantage of us. Plus, they are Ostelians. We need papers to be able to eat now? Is this what you learned at home? Get lost! This man was a snake. He would sneak in, you couldn't hear him coming, and once he was there, it was too late. Let's see what you've got for me. Hello? Yeah... Yeah... Yeah... Ok. I need copper. Can your little rats find that for me? You're smart. Here you go, as promised. Don't do that Adriel! Adriel, no! Fuck off, you idiot! What would your mother say? She is dead, my mother! Hey, would you draw me? Why not? - But I want a beautiful face. - Then don't move. Look at me. I could draw you too. You're pretty. Yeah, right. I like the drawings on your face. - It's the mark of the Skanderbergs. Did it hurt? I don't remember, I was young. It's difficult to remember the past, when we were little. Having fun, lovebirds? Let her go! Are you giving me orders? Iskender, you've forgotten who you're talking to. - You said you wouldn't touch the kids. - I said, I said... Kids are selling well right now. I've got demands. So I am hesitating. Not everybody would hesitate. Ouch. Okay, you win. Just take it. What are you thinking about? They won't come back. I waited for nothing. - I told you. Stay with me. - No. I promised my father that I would bring my brother to Arcata. He is in danger here. We will cross the border. Nobody is crossing, it's over. - I will cross. - You will be arrested. - I will cross. - First you'd have to cross the water. Don't leave, Kyona. I can protect you here. Here you are safe. You, out! - You're hurting me. I said: out! - Clear off! - Stand up, little brat! - Don't move, otherwise... - Hey, you over there! Bring that kid back here! Everybody down! - Get in! - Let go of me! - You can't take them, I was promised... - What? - We have agreements. - I'm not aware. Leave it. He's a friend of Jon. This whole thing stinks. - Take him too! - No! They'll work it out at the police station. Don't worry, Kyona. They'll release us, they can't keep us. Line up against the wall! Everybody! Hands on your head... You too! The brother and the sister, perfect! I take them both. - You promised! Had I asked you, you'd have said no. It's easier to deal with the police. One day, I'll kill you, I swear, I'll kill you! Yeah, right! Let's go! - Iskender! - Let's go! Iskender! I hadn't realized until then how attached I was to him. I felt like he was being ripped away from me. This should be fine. You'll look less dirty. We're sick of disgusting kids. People don't want them anymore. Your name is Adriel, right? And you, girl? - Why would I tell you? - Out of kindness, darling. Don't call me darling. As you wish, dirtbag! As long as you put on clean clothes. Don't be squeamish, it's not the first time I see naked kids. If you're not nice, you could be smart. You might as well die here. I get you out of jail, help you cross the water, you don't say thank you? - We will cross the water? - If I tell you. Look what I found. - My notebook! It's yours, right? Isn't he nice, Jon? Are we less angry suddenly? So, what do you say? My name is Kyona. It's for the two kids. - Are you crossing with them? - No, I've got papers. I take the ferry. A small boat. 150. 150? Isn't it a bit too much? Do the cops know about your rates? I'm the one rowing, I have to pay myself. Not sure they need you. They can row too. You want to get them back in one piece? Then it's 120. 110 and I tell no one. And you, make sure you don't drown. 55 now, the rest upon delivery. Ok, we meet at the wrecks. Don't move! I want it to stop, Kyona. I want it to stop now. And that everything gets back to normal. - Adriel, I'm here! We are in Lower-Bathely. They'll be at your house in an hour. Get in! - How is business? - As you can see. These ones are cuter than the ones from last time. It's true, they were ugly. I placed them anyway. How is it going with the farm? - It's alright. So many people at the boats this morning, we're not short of staff. - Yeah. Adriel, we crossed the water! I don't care. You're always lying. - I am lying? - We were supposed to find mom and dad. Everything you say is a lie. - Why am I still taking care of you? If only I hadn't promised... - Leave me alone, I don't need you! Where are we? - In Lower-Bathely, Miss pain in the ass. - Domaine Paradiso. Maxime Della Chiusa, prince of finance and money. And his wife Florabelle. No need to introduce her. - Why? - Florabelle, the actress. - They are too young to remember. They come from a shithole! Here is your new family. Stop it, you idiot! It looks bad! Don't run away. If you behave well, they will adopt you. You'll be rich. This is your chance! Jon! It's always a pleasure to see you. - Did everything go well? - Of course, Sir. They are in good shape. Nice hair, nice teeth. The girl is called Kyona, the boy, Adriel. He sold us like puppies. But to be away from him, I would have followed anyone. My husband's office. That's where he makes money for his family. Let's go! I hated her right away. Everything about her disgusted me. I just had everything repainted. Here is your room, little boy. And the little girl's room. My children's bedrooms! I thought she was crazy. We weren't little, we weren't her kids. What was she up to? Sit down, my little darlings. Oh no! No hands! It's disgusting! Maxime, tell them. As of tonight, you, boy, your name is Peter. And you, girl, Janet. You don't need your old names anymore. I want you to call me Daddy. And your mom... Call her Mommy. So, Janet? So, Peter? Yes... Yes who? Yes... Daddy. Good, that's a good boy! Do you like him, Florabelle? Hmm! But his hair, Maxime... It's very black, isn't it? Very black, indeed. That's too bad. Ouch! That mop! I can never untangle it. Marie, come here! Ouch! Ouch! I can't anymore, cut it! Please, don't touch my hair, please! No! Ouch! - Eat, my dear Peter. - Leave me alone, please! - Stop, no! - Make Mommy happy. - Stop wriggling! - Ah! You can go out now if you want. Go play outside. Look what she did to me! You have nothing to say?! She keeps putting things in your mouth! It's disgusting! Don't swear. I don't like it when you scream. - She will choke you, your hear me? Adriel, answer me! Shut up. There was nowhere to hide. It was like the house was alive and it was watching us. Janet, don't go so far! Or we'll have to look for you everywhere! We need to see you. Always. Where do you want me to go? It's a prison everywhere. Why aren't you nice like your brother? Would be easier... Your brother is nice. - Which brother? My brother was skinny, had black hair and a rotten temper! I don't have a brother anymore! She took him from me! You're so bad. But I'll tell you something. Your brother is smarter than you are. He's got Madame eating out of his hand, that's all that matters here. Don't go into the forest, do you hear me? I heard it eats kids. You would never come back alive. Yeah right, I could use a good laugh. Laugh all you want, I am watching you! Janet! Janet, please! I've tried everything. I can't change her! She doesn't fit here. She really doesn't. No, indeed, she doesn't fit. Come here. You're so lucky to have wings. I lost it. - You lost it? - Ouch! Yes, I lost it. - Bad girl. Bad girl! Mommy doesn't want you anymore. They were almost done stuffing Adriel. Soon, it would be my turn. Time was running out. Move over. Adriel. She hates me. She's gonna kill me. We have to get out of here. We'll go into the forest. They won't look for us in there. They are scared of it. - No. - What no? I stay here, at home. But I can't leave without you. I felt so sorry for him. It was as if he'd forgotten everything. Like he was frozen. All cold inside. A real patriot. Show your mother how handsome you are. Go downstairs too, the guests are coming. I'll come down when I want. I'm not in a hurry. Who is the client? You have to sort things out! Don't get angry, we'll find a solution. It's not easy to find a brother and a sister their age. I don't need both. The boy is okay. It's the girl you're taking back. Ah, then it's not a problem. We can make the switch today. - Today is perfect. We have guests. - Florabelle! Florabelle, what the hell are you doing? They are here! Alright, I'm coming! Marcus, my friend. - Florabelle... - Come! - What? - As beautiful as ever. - We're leaving! Now! - What? Now? - Hurry, Jon is coming back. Oh! My darling! Peter! Catch them! Catch them! I'm not going in there, it's cursed. If they want the kids, they can go themselves! - They don't care. They didn't like the girl, anyway. I had my brother back. I mean, almost. When we'll see mom and dad again, they won't recognize you. - You still think we'll see them again? Of course. They are going to Arcata and we are too. If you stop believing, you are dead. And now? What do you believe in? Kyona! Kyona! Adriel! Can you hear me? Adriel! Where are you? Adriel! Who are you? Where is my brother? Did you find me? I must find my brother. I lost him in the snow. I can't stay without him. Take me back to where you found me. I'm begging you. Come closer. Look. You are beautiful. Do you have family? A deer? A doe? Do you have a brother? I like it when you smoke. Did I ever tell you that my dad used to make cigarettes? He was selling them in the city. It wasn't allowed but we had to earn money. I can't say I thought about them all the time. It's more like they crossed my mind. With my brother, it's special. I still picture him in the present. He tells me that he's waiting for me. And I'm here, stuck with you and the animals. Are you listening? You know, I've slept in boxes. I was sold to people. I lost my father, my mother, and now... My brother. So? You think you're the only one? Have you seen anything? We're looking for two kids. A boy and a girl. For the boy, there is a reward. You know what happens if you hide them? Maybe you eat them. - Maybe yes... People don't like witches. If I were you, I'd be careful. If I were you, I would leave. Men who are turned into toads, you've seen that too, huh? Ouch! You were so beautiful! Your brooch. Is it for me? It's a gift for a Queen! Goodbye, you! I had just spent months in silence. So all these people, this noise, scared me. I wasn't used to people anymore. I spotted her right away. She had a very bossy way of not doing anything. Ouch! What are you spying on? Where are you from? I asked you a question. I... I don't know. You spent the winter in the forest, right? - You think it's her? - Didn't you run away from the actress? You're the one everyone was looking for? I can't stay, I have to go. Follow me, I have a surprise for you. Kyona! Adriel? I knew I would find you. I've always known that. I missed you. I saw you all the time, everywhere. Look at my hair, it's black. Is it really you? You've changed... - You too, old lady. You're even pretty now. You're pretty too. We don't have all day, we gotta go! Give her your dress. We'll find you something else. Here, they call me Madame. The children call me Auntie. What do you prefer? Madame. Adriel had dragged himself through the storm. And finally the forest spit him out. Madame saw him coming to the camp, cold blue in his little suit. She warmed him up and kept him. He spent the whole winter there, hiding under a dress. As long as we could mistake him for a girl, he was safe. The girls at Madame's were sacred. Your sister has to work too. She'll work with you, Erdewan will teach her. You three will do the act. Adriel! Adriel! We're off! My brother knew everyone, everyone loved him. I didn't recognize him. It seemed like a new Adriel had used the winter to get out of his body. Look at that, Shaké. Beautiful from head to toe. Erdewan! He was so handsome. Problem was, he knew it. Don't listen to him. He can't help but show off. Hey girls, let's keep in touch. I have a lot to tell you! We were managing Madame's circus. In return, she was protecting us. And she was sneaking us towards the border. That's why we were all here, for the border. Can you at least try?! I can't be interested in balls. I can't. Ask me something else. - It's not complicated! - I could learn how to dance. - No, not a dancer! Why not? - Because dancers... - Stop screaming, it won't help her. Come on, try again! That's it! She really sucks, right? Yeah. I wonder why I keep her. If I didn't like her brother, I would tell her to go. She is funny, she could play the clown. - You're afraid I'll chase her away? - You wouldn't, she's family. She is my sister. And you are my mother. Shut up, I'm way too young! I had to get on it. No pain, no gain. Soldiers liked Madame's girls too. Soy they'd leave us alone. - Come on, girl! In the caravan, we all knew the girls were buying peace. Can you make room for me? Your hair looks so silky. - What's wrong with you? - What? - We get along well together. - Yes, but not like that. - But I'm handsome and I adore you. - Hands off, or I'll call my brother! Hey, Adriel! I told you she wouldn't like it. But it's night. And nobody can see us. - Ask the dancers! - They are too old, and I really like you. Then leave me alone! Alright, your loss. You always want everything right away. Everything right away, yes. Have you seen where we live? Do you think we have time to wait? The further we got, the more soldiers there were. Madam was becoming more and more tense. One day, her dancers would not be enough to remove the roadblocks. Stop! Let them pass! See you later! - Bye girls! - Bye girls! - You have a strange look on your face. - It's you... Nothing disgusts you, you make deals with everyone. - I'm doing the best I can. Nothing is pure black or white. Life is grey. If you want to make it, start seeing grey. So, can you show us your drawings? This is in Stemestvar. We were living with them. - That's a cute one! - Who's that? Nobody. A guy I used to know. - He didn't want everything right away? - You never forget anything. Here is my home, Novi Varna. - Novi Varna? I met people from Novi Varna, when working at the farm. - What were they called? - I don't know... - What were they doing? Looking for the border, like everyone. Was it them? - There are so many people on the road... - Try to remember! Imagine, if you saw them... I shouldn't have said anything. Forget about it. It's your turn! It's her! Arrest her! - Oh no! - Let go of me! Hold her! - It's my daughter! - Your daughter? No way? You have a daughter now? Jon, I thought you were burning in hell. Do you have papers for her? You think I have time for that? Bothering people for papers? Don't get angry. Did you know she ran away from a farm? Of course she didn't brag about it. I'm not the one selling them like cattle. Oh, please! What about the ones working hard in your circus? Who is going to do the act? Please be nice, let her go! - Madam! - Move along, that's enough. - Shaké! - Should we control the others? Jon is back there, don't turn around. - Hypocrite! - It suits you. You're no better than me, fatty. They're gone. They took Shaké. I couldn't do anything. Don't look at me like that! You think I'm the good Lord? Who is Jon? The one who sold us. He will come back. We need to leave. We're not far from the border. - So? You know how to get through? We'll find out. We? Are you coming with us? You think I'll leave my darling alone with you? - What do you expect? - What do you think? - Leaving without saying goodbye? - Madam... It's alright, get out of here. She was sad. I was, too. I kept losing people along the way. My heart had become a sieve. Adriel, I'm tired. I have chills, I don't feel well. Hey! Look out! The road is too dangerous. We have to climb up into the mountain. There is a village. We'll find smugglers. I had the impression that the village was getting further and further away. I was hot, I was cold. My whole body hurt. All of a sudden, we were facing the first houses... This way! Don't move! Hands up! That's when we left for Shalangar. Shalangar, a hole dug in the mountain. The end of the journey for those who didn't get through. You'd be thrown in there and left to rot. Faster! Men to the left! Women to the right! Give me your bag! What's that? In the bin! Next! No way! My goodness! You did that on purpose! You little wretch, take that! Next! You, move! Hurry up! You! Follow the others! Move! Move! Did they hit you? I feel sick. I'm dizzy. I think I'm going to pass out. - Wait, you can lie down. Hello you, we're gonna live together, and I'm sure that... - Shut up, you're making noise. His name was Issawa. But I barely noticed him. I was burning with fever. Please Madam, my sister is sick. - Everyone is sick. There's no medicine here. She is not well. - Good point, man. - She is going to die. - No, that's forbidden. My brother died. Give her fruit. Issawa, do you know where we can get medicine? Maybe. You got something to sell? When we'll get out of here, I'll take you with us. He is crazy. Nobody gets out. They will take you and hang you. Oh no! Nobody can catch me. If you make it, will you take me with you? I promise. I know a man who has medicine. I'll bring him to your sister. She's not my sister. - I'll bring him to your wife? I like that better! Here you go! The medicine guy! Iskender? You're alive! It was normal to meet again here. We took the same roads, got arrested by the same soldiers, ended up in the same camps. Cover her up. And she has to eat. Eat? But there is nothing. I'll find something. I've seen him before. I don't think so. I met him in Stemetsvar. The guy from the drawing! He was with your sister, right? Stop with my sister! He's gonna help us. - What does he want in return? - He is jealous, he is jealous! Jealous of what? Don't be ridiculous! Iskender came back every day, he waited for Erdewan to be away. Without him, I would have died that summer. You didn't tell anyone, did you? - Of course not. Thanks Iskender, you're a true friend. - No friends here. - And what am I? - You? You were one of my men. What the hell is he doing here? He is bringing medicine. How do you think he finds them? Get out of here! - Don't touch me! - Get the hell out of here! - Watch out. - Are you threatening me? - Loser! - Don't ever come back. Can't you stop yelling? Look... She is waking up! I had dreams. In one dream you were giving me fruit. Three small fruits. In other dreams I saw Iskender, bringing me cookies. It was not a dream, he is here and he cured you. - Iskender? - You didn't dream about me? Who is he? I wish I was your son. - But I'm not your mother, little boy. - It doesn't matter, I'm alone. You're old enough to have kids. Look, you have boobs and everything. - What am I going to do with you? - I don't know, love me? It was getting hotter and hotter. No one ventured out into the sunshine. Everyone was staying inside. It made no difference for me. I was too weak to go out. Hello, little thief! I started drawing again. I was a big hit with the kids from the block. Little by little, I was strong enough to go out of that hovel. I wasn't going far, and I was discovering life in the camp. - Kyona, Kyona, draw me! - Come one, draw me! - Me, me, me! - Wait! Wait your turn! - No, me! - What about me? - Please, please! - Iskender? - Show me your drawings! - Move! - Come on! - Iskender! - How beautiful! - That's me! - Where is Kyona? - Outside. I look great! Kyona! Why didn't you come back to see me? What for? You were healed. So what? Iskender, did you forget everything? Did I forget you? Open your eyes, look where we are. - I have to go. - Wait! I have a present for you. How did you get that? My mom was wearing one. I know. I don't want it. Please take it. Take it for me. Kyona... No, I can't. There is no hope... I thought about Iskender endlessly. I would have given anything to see him again. - Waiting for someone? - Leave me alone! Do you have a date? So? Did you get what I asked for? I should have known, I was so stupid... - Here, for you! Iskender had always done this: dirty deals, I sell you that, I trade you that, that's all he knew. Kyona, we're leaving. Some friends are escaping, and they're taking us! What's going on? - I need something else, you promised me. Are you crying? It's because of the sun. But Kyona, what did you think? He is a rat. Don't stay here, come... The days were cooler and shorter. We were waiting... Get in line like everybody else! - Move! - This kid's got a nerve! I wonder how he is able to feed them. He doesn't feed them, you naive! He eats them. This is it. We are leaving. - Now? Tonight? - Yes. - We're waiting for the signal. - I'm so scared, Erdewan. No, Kyona. I don't want to know. We're together, we'll be happy. You'll see. Very happy. That's them! Let's go! Erdewan! Kyona! Now! Come! Go! It's this way. Nobody moves. Step back! Step back! Did you hear? Don't move! - Take that! - Bastards! Bastards! Quick, this way! Hey, my brother! Hey! Erdewan! Erdewan! No! No! Noooo! Erdewan... Kyona, Kyona, we have to leave! Quick! Quick! After that, I don't remember much. We went down into the tunnel, we walked, I couldn't see anything, I couldn't feel anything. And then I saw daylight. Oh no! Not you! You were right, some always manage to get out that way... Iskender?! My favourites... What a joy! But I won't let you go this time, right Iskender? I told you I'd kill you. Forget, Kyona... Forget about him. He followed us from a distance for a while. And then we didn't see him anymore. Kyona, it's so beautiful! There you are! From now on, it's straight ahead. Fleeing had ruined our childhood and, with it, our entire former life. I didn't know what was waiting for us on the other side, but Adriel and Issawa were with me. We had crossed the last border.
