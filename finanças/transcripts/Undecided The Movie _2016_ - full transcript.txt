[anchor 1] The 2016 presidential election may come down to the undecided vote. [anchor 2] ...13% of voters' poll say they don't back either major party candidate... [anchor 3] ...come October, November, they're gonna have to pick a side... [anchor 2] ...well, with these numbers, they could decide the election either way. [John] Oh! Florida! Home, sweet home, huh? My name's John, I live here in West Palm beach, Florida. I was up in Orlando for seven years for college, UCF - You Can't Fail! Proved them wrong. My dad, he's got his own law firm, Nelson & Nelson, the other Nelson is my brother. My dad and him are always... always working together, so, they, they're busy a lot of the time. Which is fine 'cause I-- I'm busy too. Typical day here in Florida, you hit the beach with a couple of your boys, play some volleyball, bring a 12-pack, we can't beat that. Girls would, just like, go to the beach in a bikini. It's basically like, a bra and underwear. You'll see when you follow me around. I'm kinda the Mayor of this town. Yeah, yeah. I know Julian. We had shots at the bar the other night. That's Julian, I call him J-Birder. What was your name, again? Who are you? Class of '05, right? I don't know who you are! I don't know who the fuck you are. She's being weird. I think we probably hooked up, once or twice. [Dan] Well, my hometown has about 50,000 people in it, which sounds like a lot, but feels really small. Hey, guys, uh, come on in. It's Dan and mom's house, for a little while longer. Oh, God! I was on the hockey team for a couple of years. I'm not in either of the photos because I was the equipment manager. I took... took the photos. You know, I used to get the equipment from the equipment room out to the ice so fast, like a locomotive. They used to call me Danny, the Tranny. I was one of the guys. I've never, uh... had a girlfriend. Yes! I mean, I don't like to put labels on things. But I know that I've never had a girlfriend. Defense, come on! [John] You know, I've always been a Republican, but I hurt my shoulder and didn't have insurance, so I had to sign up for Obama Care. My dad is running for office, it is very anti-government handouts. A local newspaper found out that I signed up for Obama Care, and they kinda had a field-day with that. [laughs] Then my dad kinda cut me off, big time. I guess, I'm a liberal moocher now. I... I'm a little conflicted over it. You guys wanna see top rope hurricanrana? [Dan] My mom, you know, took out a second mortgage on the house, so I could open up my Mac & Cheese shop. I was always a Democrat, and I think paying people a living wage is really important, so we had a meeting the before we opened the shop, and everyone said that $25 an hour was a living wage, and everyone is really excited, you know? Especially, the High School kids. I mean, they were laughing. [Dan] We won Best Fall Eats, and three weeks later, we were closed. Since the shop went under, my mom has just been hangin' out upstairs. She'll kind of work on a corona over the course of few days. I love you, mom. The good news is, we don't have to pay a moving company to take everything out, 'cause the bank said, they would just take it. [Dan] So, yeah, I guess, I've just been questioning things, a little more. Hopefully, I can do this show and my dad'll see that I understand politics, and I don't need handouts, and I'm not a moocher, and he'll let me move back in the house. [Dan] I'm excited to do this show because then I'll have enough money to pay my mom back, and the bank won't take the house, and... I wanna go on a road trip, you know? 'Cause that's something you do with a friend. I get to learn about all these great people who are in-charge of keeping the American dream alive. Sadly, the American dream is dead! The stakes for America's future are about as great as they come. [Hillary Clinton] We all know we're not yet running the way America should. [Bernie] For most Americans, their reality is that they're working longer hours for lower wages. [Marco Rubio] Despite our troubles, we have it within our power to make our time another American century. That is what makes this nation an indispensable nation in the history of the world. Ladies and gentlemen... ...I have a message. I am proud to announce... ...I've decided... ...to run... ...for President of the United States... Yes, I am running for President. We're in this race to win. I declare... ...that I am a candidate... -I'm a candidate... -...for President... ...for President of the United States. Thank you, all. [candidate] Join us! Join us! [news anchor] Just seven days to go before the Iowa caucuses, we have team coverage for you as the candidates make their final pitch to voters... You guys excited for this project? [man] Oh, yeah! -[Jen] The set looks great. -[man] Nice sling. [John] All right, so just... Keep this in my pocket? -[man] John's here, you want me to send him in? -Cool. Okay, we're all set. Send him in. Just to get you in this chair. -Hi, John, I'm Jen. -Hey! -Nice to meet you in person. -Yeah, nice to meet you. I was out there for like ten minutes. Oh, sorry about that. Uh, feel free to take a seat. -I'm gonna be on camera here, huh? -[Jen] Yeah! -[Jen] Yeah, yeah, yeah! -Awesome! -[Jen] Hi! You must be Dan. -Sorry, everyone, I'm late. Yeah. I couldn't find the baggage claims. Not a problem, nice to meet you in person. -[Dan] Okay, so I'll sit here-- -[Jen] Take a seat. -[Dan] Okay. -Can I ask you a quick question? Shouldn't it be like a guy and a girl doing this? [Jen] We don't have a lot of time, we actually have to get on the road pretty soon. John. -Dan. -Too slow. Uh, tell us your name, and why you're an undecided voter. My name is Dan Stiefler, I'm from Colorado. -[Jen] Hold on, one more time. -[Dan] Yeah. [Jen] John, if you're going to sigh, the camera's going to pick that up, so... I didn't vote in the previous election. My mom told me that I wasn't old enough yet. [Jen] How old are you, Dan? I'm 32. [John] This is cool. This is your home for the next six months. There are two beds, one on the-- -[John] I'll take this one. -[Dan] You want that one? Okay, got a bunk. Wow! I can talk to the driver-- I'll see you get a weekly stipend and then you'll get your lump some at the end of your six months. Actually I want that one. The RV is equipped with Wi-Fi to research the candidates, which are all listed on the white board right here just to keep track... -This is good, too. -That's mine. -Okay. -Get you out of here. All right. Three pillows! Is it haunted? I'll put my bags here, and then you can just sleep, -maybe sleep over here, grab the floor. -Yeah. At first, I was like this might suck, but this looks like its a lot of fun. Oh, its gonna be fun. Yeah, it's already been so much fun. What is that? A fridge in a car? Hey, what's the deal with bringin', uh... girls back? [Jen] Whatever you guys wanna do... It's not gonna be a problem for me. [Jen] As long as it's consensual. I like this bed. Maybe we'll be best friends. -This is the production phone, all right? -Got it. All correspondence needs to happen in this phone, got it? -Yeah. -Okay. Now, upload the footage every night, and then the hard drives, -keep them locked up in this bad boy... -Got it. And keep that locked in the RV at all times. Obviously, keep the footage locked in a safe place. -That's all I'm saying. -Okay. Oh, hey! Hey, guys. -Hi. -Hey! This is Raj. -Oh, hi. -Yeah, it's Raj. Raj... Roger. -John. -Good to see you. -Hey. -Dan. Now I'm the guy who sticks behind and does the ground work, while you guys are out having a good time, making magic happen. Right, you're like our assistant. Yeah, sorta like that. Yeah. Anyway, this is gonna be exciting, six months on the road... -They're excited. -Wow! Politics brings people together. -Right? -Yeah! That should be good, and remember, you guys keep rolling everything. I want all the footage, just keep those cameras going, all right? -Good, great! -Yeah. -Good to see you. -Yeah, nice to see you, Raj. It's Raj, but that's cool. I'm gonna head out. Could you get me a sparkling water while you're out? -It'll be great. -Will do. -Thank you. -Absolutely, all right. Have fun, okay. Am I supposed to tip him? We met Roger, I guess he represents the investors. Yeah, I don't even know what that means. But a really slick dresser. And he shook my hand way too hard. What are you guys looking for in a candidate? I want somebody who is a man, you know, 30, 40 years older than me, supportive of me, and loves me no matter what. You're talking about a candidate? Yeah, candidate for president. I'm maybe not making myself clear, so issues in terms of like... -The environment. -...the environment. Yeah, and I think the best environment to hang out with somebody would just be a place where you can bond, and eat so much ice cream our stomach hurts together, you know. You want a candidate who you can eat ice cream with? I mean, that would-- Is that-- Yeah. How about religion? We used to walk past a church on the way to the pumpkin patch. -Are you a Jew? -What? -Are you a Jew? -Yeah. Is that a problem? Okay, uh, let's talk about something else. [news anchor] After months of speculation, today Rick Santorum made it official. Besides the presidency, the former US Senator will try to win back to back Iowa Caucuses. So, Jen thought it'd be a good idea for us to meet our first candidate, Rick Santorum, at a gun range in Iowa. I've never fired a gun before in my life. [Dan] Cool, all right, yeah. And how much is the ammo? But we can share, right? How're you doin'? Good to see everybody. How are you? [Dan] Apparently, this guy won the Iowa Caucus four years ago, so the odds of even gettin' near him are pretty slim. All right, where we headin'? I think we got to take a gun-safety course in here. [John] So, having a concealed carry permit doesn't give you a waiver? [Rick] I don't think it does. [Dan] It should, though, right? That would make sense. -You would think so, right? -[Dan] Yeah. All right, let's go to lane number four. -It's like bowling. - When you hear a cease fire, immediately take your finger off of the trigger, bring your elbows down to your side, while keeping the muzzle pointed down range and then wait. Before you get ready to shoot, make sure your sights are lined up... You ever fired assault rifle? -Yeah, sure. -Oh, yeah? -We own three... -Oh, nice. -...fifteens, yeah. -Oh, sweet. Do you guys have a lot of land to go shooting? We do have land but, you know, the county I live in, you're not allowed to discharge a firearm. Oh, really? What, really? You can legally shoot people, or animals too? Uh, you can't shoot anything. My dad would always take my brother to the gun range, and he wouldn't take me. Why didn't he take you to the gun range? Seems like it would be easy to... How's it lookin' for the Caucus? How you feelin'? I feel, you know, I feel like we're gonna surprise some people. Yeah, that's what I felt. And confidence is key, obviously. -Yeah, people pick up on that. -Absolutely. -Yeah. -[Rick] We feel good. -Been tryin' to rally as much support as I can for you guys. -Thank you. We can take this. -Thank you. -Yeah. Do you have any questions? -No. -No, that was great. Let's shoot a gun, let's do it. -Did you get us a lane? -Yeah. -I hope he hits it. -Yeah, he will. Don't worry about that, Rick could do anything. Nice, that was a neck shot. Nice shot, dad. -You want to take a shot? -Yeah, I'd love to. -Could you help me load this? -Sure. Are you good to go? -Just shoot. -I dunno if the safety's on or not. That is awesome. I feel like I've got so much power, right now. No one's gonna mess with me when I got-- Oh! Put that down, good job... I get the-- I get it now, that makes sense. -Lot of fun. -That is fun. -You want to shoot this one? -I do. It was weird to shoot a gun near Rick Santorum, because I've never shot one before, and nobody asked who I was. So I just-- Finger off the trigger until you're ready to go. [Dan] That was great. Ever since, I, you know, I was off my-- Oh! ...my medication, I feel like I finally found a sense of peace, you know what I mean? This-- this was incredible, thank you. Could I keep that as a memento? What do I do? Oh, my God! Long story short, we would've killed this guy for sure. He would have died. I love Rick Santorum. He sat with me and watched, uh... watched a movie, taught me how to fire a gun, and if he's gonna be there for me now, imagine if he's president. Can you get out of here, please? Oh, fuck! [news anchor] In other news tonight, Democrat Martin O'Malley met with the voters north of the quad-cities, today. Jen said we're gonna go to a rally for Martin O'Malley, which rhymes. I think one of the crew members must've gone on our computer, 'cause there's some really weird stuff on there. [John] Yeah, that's probably the crew. [Dan] I just wanted to do a little research about the next candidate, Martin O'Malley. -[John] Who? - He seems really-- Martin O'Malley. We're gonna go see him right now. I'm really excited, he seems like a smart guy. -[John] Who? - Martin O'Malley. -You want me to tune it? -You know how to tune it? -Yeah. -Yeah? What's your name? -My name's Dan, how are you? -Hey, Dan, how are you? You know, I just want to say that, I... you know... I've been hearin' about what you're sayin', and you have a friend in me... -Yeah. -Thanks a lot, man. This is so fun, we're friends, right? -We are friends. -We need friends, everyone needs a best friend. -What's your name? -Martin O'Malley. Oh, Martin, nice to meet you. Well, look, it's wonderful to be with all of you, I love your state. I love its beauty, I love its landscape, I love the warmth. [crowd laughing] I love its people. [Dan] He's funny. With three of us in this race, there's only one of us who could upset the apple card. [Dan] We're rootin' for you. Well, thank you, and I need you. Caucus night, I know that you guys take this very, very seriously. Can we get an amen to that one? [Dan] Yeah! Seems a little bland. Thanks a lot for coming out. I tell you, you're talkin' a lot about togetherness, and most importantly, friendship. Solidarity. We're all in this together. Martin O'Malley is the candidate for me, he's really the total package. He's got nice-ness, he's got, um... He cares-- he's got caring... Where's that guitar? -It's broken. -I don't think-- I think we're way out of tune, man. [crowd laughing] We'll do an A Capella. * Home in the midst Of the corn * * The middle of The US of A * * Here's where I was born * And here's where I'm goin' to stay * Here's the chorus. * Iowa! * Iowa * Winter, spring Summer or fall * * Come see * Come, dance with me * To the beautiful Iowa It's very well done. * Iowa * Iowa * Winter, spring Summer and fall * [John] He's a big pussy, he's gonna lose. [Dan] What are you talkin' about? Look how many people are in there. [John] They hate him. [Dan] He's a friend of mine. Don't talk about a friend of mine like that. [Dan] Don't talk about a friend of mine like that. I pick a winner. When I pick a winner, I'm all in. -You gonna be okay? -Yeah, it's like a dull pain. You want a lollipop? The people at the tattoo shop were lookin' at me like I was crazy. [John] I'm sure there are a lot of Santorum 2016 tattoos out there. You think it was a good idea to get a tattoo on... on your arm there. That's a really stupid question. That's the next president of the United States. Oh, no, I know, but like, you know, what if he... If he doesn't win or... I just wouldn't want our votes to cancel each other out... Shut up, shut up! You're an idiot. You know, my mom always said that if somebody didn't like you, they weren't worth liking back. Oh, do you know what else your mom said? [talking gibberish] [John] Here he is. Oh, this is exciting. -Hey, Rick. -How are you? -Good to see you. -It's good to see you again. I wanna let you know I got this... -For you. -Okay. So, we're gonna take it home, right? -All right. -Jesus! -Pretty cool, right? -Yeah. It's interesting. So, I met a really good friend today, and also a presidential candidate. I just thought I'll make him a couple of gifts, the best way to have a friend is to be a friend. I made him a mix-CD, and then I made him a picture of us, um, and some woman, probably maybe his wife. I just really hope he likes 'em. Hey, Marty. I made you a couple of things, I wanna say, I made you a mix with the Iowa thing on it and a fun picture, and I hope you know no matter what happens, I just think you're gonna be a good friend going forward, and... and I hope to see you at lunch tomorrow, or racket ball, or something. -We're gonna hang out, right? -All right, Dan. -All right. -[Dan] Come on, all right. -[John] Who's that guy? -It's Martin O'Malley. That's the President, that's the future president. -Him? -Yeah. He's a great-- [news anchor] Iowa is choosing, the world is watching, and this night will change the course of the 2016 campaign. To win Iowa, everybody wants to do it. Tonight's the night, Iowa Caucus. Martin O'Malley is gonna win, and I'm gonna feel so happy for my friend. Martin O'Malley is a loser. Rick Santorum is a winner, and we're takin' it home tonight. Two in a row! He's not gonna let me down. Whoo! The best way that I can, uh, do what I set out to do when we announced to run for president to be done, uh, by not furthering our campaign, by not continuing our campaign, and by-- [news anchor] Do you mean you are suspending you campaign? [Rick] ...suspending our campaign as of this moment. Wait, he just quit the race? Martin O'Malley, uh... he looks like he dropped out too. He told me we were gonna take it home. Just to lose? Martin O'Malley said he'll play racket ball-- No! That's-- We're not talkin' about Martin O'Malley. We're talkin' about Rick Santorum, we're talkin' about him just turning his back on people that believe in him. I'm not doing this, everybody is the same. You know what? I quit, I'm out. -I'm out. -[Jen] Are you serious? Yes, I'm serious. [Jen] Hmm... That's... -[Jen] That's not cool. -It's just me now, huh? -No, it doesn't actually work like that. -What-- What do you mean? Um, if John's out, then we're gonna have to recast. What? They'll still... They'll still pay me, right? Because... -You told me. -[Jen] Um... You know, I think, for the week, uh... Hi, yeah, John just walked out. Yeah, he like left, left. -[Jen] I don't know. -We lived in a car for a while. [Jen] Can you call him? [Jen] Yeah, I know. I don't know how to-- I don't know how to-- I do not want to do. Okay. Or you could try that. You just tell my dad that I'm-- I'm gonna be comin' home tomorrow, and, uh... I'm not gonna embarrass him anymore, and... I might need a place to stay. Yeah. All right, yeah. Thanks. -Hey, John. -Jesus Christ! Sorry, who was that on the phone? It's my dad's assistant. That's fine, I think you should bring up your dad, 'cause I overheard Jen talking to him just now. -What? -Yeah. He was sayin' something about how he really wants you to, to stay on the show, and kinda be your own man. -My dad said that? -Yeah. I should call him right now, then. No, no, no. No! Because he said that he wouldn't admit it, like, if you called him. I think if we work together we'll find the right candidate. We'll really both be successful, and you can prove something to your dad. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, maybe, maybe. Hey, it's on her. Oh! Oh, that's me. What are you doin'? You got to talk to her. I've to-- I've to talk to her? Yeah, she bought you a beer, that means she likes you. Oh! -All right-- -Let's go. Why are you coming? 'Cause I'm your wingman. -[girl] He's cute. -All right. [woman moaning] Dan, what are you doin'? It's freezing out here. Ah, hi, Jen. Uh, yeah, I was just... just bein' a wingman. Get up. Come on, get up. Wow! It is really nice in here. Should I... Should I sleep on this floor, or this floor? -Anywhere's good. -You can sleep on the couch. -That's fine. -Oh. Cool, all right. A pillow? Okay. Is John here? Uh... I haven't seen him, no. Did you call him and see? -Ah, yeah. I've called him 20 times... -Okay. So, I have no idea where he is. -Okay. -But we are leaving in ten minutes. -So... -And then it's... Okay. -Mornin', guys. -John. You made it. He's back. Got you a coffee, cream and sugar. Thank you. I guess my dad wants me to stay on the show, and the whole thing is a test. He wants to see if I can do somethin' on my own. So, thank you. I appreciate that. Let's hit the road. Okay. Uh, off to New Hampshire. Yeah, is it close? It's gonna be so fun. John... Road trip! After the disappointment of our first two candidates, it was kinda hard to bounce back. We're just a little nervous because there are so many, and it starts to feel overwhelming-- You know, when I was a kid, whenever my family was faced with a really tough decision, we would seek spiritual guidance. I was never religious, so you'll have to kinda show me how it goes. Oh, yeah, I mean, I don't believe in God, or anything, but I'm very religious. Okay. [indistinct chatter] [Dan] It's hard to pick, right? Yeah, I just feel like we need a little bit more help. We got to get this done for Governor Huckabee. The story of Nehemiah reminds us that Nehemiah had been called to build that wall in Jerusalem, just like you were called to be here today. The next President of the United States... [crowd cheering] I put it this way. Tomorrow night is in God's hands and in yours'. I trust his hands, I trust your hands as well. People will say, "Oh, my! He done did it again!" -[crowd cheering] -Thank you, guys. [crowd shouting slogans] Hey, Mike, how're you doin'? We're just gonna do a very quick prayer with you, it's gonna be so fast. All right. Why don't we wait till we get all of these folks go, it's kinda crazy right out, or you wanna do it real quick? Dear Lord, please give all of our candidates strength to fight for you in office, in you name and in Jesus' eyes. And Lord, please give the candidates the strength to know when to quit and to leave, so we don't have to be lookin' at nine different candidates to decide our President... And to crush ISIS. In Jesus name, amen! Hey! Yeah. No, I think it's going great too. They're, like, becoming friends. It's kinda cool. Okay. No, I see what you mean, I just thought that we could get there organically, maybe. That's kinda not what I had pitched you guys, originally. All right, I'll-- I'll figure something out. I think we should get more involved in the whole process, that's the only way to really understand it is to be involved. -Right. -We're about to go meet Marco Rubio. What's his deal? Senator from Florida, right? Yeah, exactly. He's from Florida, he's very charismatic. Some people compare him to, like a Republican Kennedy, actually. He's really young and cute and... Marco... Two dollar bill? Wanna sign it? Marco! He's so cute. Marco. What do-- What is-- He looks like-- Who's the Karate Kid? Ralph Macchio. -He's like a heartthrob, a little bit, right? -Yeah. Yeah, I get it. [Jen] I didn't realize how cute he was until I saw him in person. -He's a good-looking guy. -Yeah. Mr. Rubio, my girlfriend has a crush on you, and I'm gettin' a little bit jealous, I'm gettin' a little bit jealous. I really am gettin' a little bit jealous. What can I do to win her back? You won her away from me. -Don't get jealous-- -I'm gettin' sad about it. -I keep seein' the way she looks at you. -That's a lie. Jen? Jen? Did she... Did she leave with him? You're gonna cross off Rubio? Yeah, I-- I don't like him as a candidate. I don't think we should vote for him. No, hey, I-- I kinda like him, I'd like to hear him speak. No, I really don't like him. We said we'd do this together. So, no Rubio. Jen, uh, who's the next candidate? Aw! You crossed off Marco already? I was told that that was within my rights. That's my room! I just need some privacy for a second. Well, go to your bunk. Your bags are all over the place, up here. Are you gonna complain about my bags every night? So, tonight we're going to this rally for this fresh, young Senator from Texas, named Ted Cruz. -You all right? -Yeah. [crowd applauding] [man on mic] How awesome would it be to have a president of the United States who kneels down and asks God for guidance as he's leading our country. Everywhere Ted Cruz has been he has been an advocate for what he believes in and that's who he'll be as your president. Give it up for Ted Cruz! [crowd cheering] He looks so weird. I'm starting to feel weird. I don't feel so good. Ted Cruz looks so weird. [Dan] Oh, God! [Dan vomiting] [crowd laughing] I've never seen anything like that before in my life. I saw the shape of his face and it looked like it was a man but it was melting. [Dan vomiting] I'm gonna say it. Ted Cruz. [Dan] I Feel like I'm a pretty good judge of things most of the time, but this one, I just don't get. [John] It doesn't make sense, it's not of this world. "And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea having seven heads." Those are his seven chins. "...and they worshiped the beast saying, 'Who was like unto the beast.'" The voters. Man, this is a scary book. Do you realize what this means? He's possessed. He has a demon inside him. We have to help him. Ted Cruz-- [John] I don't know if I'm ready for this, to be honest with you. The evil we're gonna face today... [Dan] I think we're doin' the right thing. [Ted] We need to defend our Constitutional Rights. If I'm elected President, the first day in office, I will instruct the Department of Justice and the IRS that the persecution of religious liberty ends today. [Dan] Ted Cruz, look in the mirror and let the evil spirit leave. Leave. Your power-hungry demonic soul will leave your wretched body. It will leave your wretched body, the evil can confront itself. Look at yourself in the mirror. [Dan and John shouting] That's why the body is so disgusting to look at. Please leave, demon. Evil, out. [John] ...into the snow. [Dan] ...fresh air... The spirit touched me in my soul. [retching] I'm so sick of the food on the truck. -Hmm, it's not that bad. -Fast food. Eatin' at truck stops, I can't do this. We should go out for, like, a nice steak dinner. [Dan] John had a really great idea. He realized if we can make a little bit of our own money, then maybe we can have a nice meal. [John] So, we're walkin' down the street, and we saw these fliers from Dale Herbert Events. Dale Herbert Events is lookin' for enthusiastic seat fillers at campaign events. -That's what we're doin' anyway. -That's perfect. Dale Herbert, what kind of a name is that? There's no way that's a real name. -Who's this seat-filling thing for, anyway? -Who cares? [John] I can't believe we're makin' 50 bucks just to sit here for two hours. [Dan] I guess, that's the job here, right? Come fill this seat. This is impressive. We got a whole network of people just helping fill seats. Oh, my ass is fallin' asleep. It's one hour, two hours... It started to spill over to the third hour-- -That's overtime. -Yeah. We weren't paid for overtime. [announcer] Please welcome the next President of the United States, Jeb Bush. Thank you all for coming. I wanna thank Governor Branstad for coming here, and well, he won't endorse, like my mother who claims that I am her favorite son. [crowd laughing] ...and volunteers from... [John] Wait, so who is this guy? [John] Is he-- Is he in charge? Yeah? I mean, he's the one she said he's in charge. -Dale Herbert? -[Dan] Yeah. -I don't know. -[Dan] I'm gonna ask. We just have been in here for a long time. [Dan] We've been here for a long time. I know, but we-- -We should just ask. -[Dan] Yeah. -Excuse me! -[Dan] Sorry. We've been here for over two hours, we haven't gotten paid for our-- We got the $50. Is Dale Herbert here? Get out of here, man. No, I'm serious. We've been-- It's been two-and-a-half hours. [Dan] You just have to give us... We're already... we still need another $12.50. This is not a joke. We need to talk to Dale Herbert, are you Dale Herbert? Are you Dale Herbert? I don't understand... Dale Herbert! Dale Herbert! What? Is Dale around? I want their names. Take their picture. -[woman] You guys are shit-bags. -[Dan] That's not nice. Shit-bags, shit-bags, shit-bags! The rumor was that he needed to pay people to be seat fillers. And in the middle of him speaking, this is what happened. We're already-- We still need another $12.50. Obviously, the rest of the crowd didn't enjoy it and Jeb Bush definitely did not enjoy it. We deserve to get paid for our time. But we got to have a really nice dinner. -This is a nice meal, right? -This is a really good idea. Yeah, this is great. I'm gonna have to thank you for letting me know about my dad's test, otherwise, I wouldn't be going on this awesome journey with you, so, thanks. Yeah. I mean, I should tell you something about that because-- I was also thinkin' about, we should go out tonight, get some girls, have a little like RV party, put a sock on the door. Ah, I can't do that. Oh, come on, man. It'll be fun. I just-- I wouldn't feel right about it because there's actually somebody that I-- think I like, you know. -What? -I may love, yeah. Who? Jen. -Jen? -Yeah. -Jen, Jen? -Yeah, you said, -if somebody does something nice for you-- -I like you. She's done a lot of nice things for me, and I feel the same way. Well, that's great. I mean, you have to tell her. Oh, no, I can't. No, you need to tell her how you feel, man. -I would feel uncomfortable-- -Dan, Dan... ...and she would feel uncomfortable, and would be hard to become-- -Listen to me. -What? You can't start a relationship off with a lie. If you do that, it can ruin the whole thing. -You know what I mean? -Yeah. What were you gonna say about my dad? I think I cut you off before. I'm-- I'm just so glad I could help out, you know. [glass shatters] What were you reaching for? Oh, my gun. You have a gun? Yeah, I've had a gun since the shooting range. -Me too! -Yeah? Yeah, because I felt so powerful and I wanted that-- No one's gonna mess with you when you've got a gun. -You could shoot right in the head. -Yeah! What kinda gun do you have? I haven't read mine, yet. I think mine's a Beretta. It says, a wal-- Walther. -[man] He's got a gun! -Who? [woman screams] I can't believe they'd kick us out just 'cause we've got guns. Yeah, I mean, what if someone came in there with a gun? What if a masseur came in there? -Who would stop him? -Us. Yeah. Everybody should have guns. What if the only person that could stop a bad guy with a gun... ...was everyone? -We gotta get to work. -That's amazing. -[John] Oh, shit! -That's mine. -[Dan] Is that mine? -This one's yours. When this falls out, there's not another one there, right? I don't know, I don't know much about guns. Here, this is yours, it's lighter. [Dan] We realized that people don't understand the importance of guns, here in America. So, we kinda came up with something that we think is pretty special. It's gonna be a new law called Arm Americans. Jen is gonna take us to a rally of a candidate who is really pro-gun. [Dan] Hello, people, our little table's over there. [John] How's it goin'? Can I get your John Hancock on this? -You wanna sign here? -You want to sign a petition for mandatory carry? -For what? -Mandatory carry. [Dan] Requiring everyone to have a firearm. [John] Yeah, just to be safer. We want everyone to carry a gun. I got misdemeanors... -That wouldn't be a problem. -Safety first. -Over the age of 16, of course. -Right. -We're not bein' stupid. -We're not insane. -[John] Hmm... -[Dan] Well, it's for safety. [John] Technically, it's for everyone to have guns, so, no, but it would-- It's for safety. -Perfect. -[John] ... couple more signatures there. -I don't want my son carryin' a gun. -Well, how old are you? He's 14. -Yeah... so two more years. -You got two more years. I'm actually kinda hungry. I think I saw some guy selling some food nearby. I'll be right back. -It says, "Support mandatory carry." -Right. That looks insane to me. No, 'cause everyone will have a gun to protect against mass shootings and things like that. That seems crazy! -John I found-- -Oh, sweet. -[Dan] Yeah. -Is that a brownie? That's an interesting texture. Yeah, it was really expensive. How much was it? -It's like $40. -What is this? We want to make it a requirement for everyone, over the age of 16, -to carry a firearm... -So fuckin' stupid! -Can we just get your sign-- -I'm a journalist. I'm not gonna sign any kind of petition. It's okay... Just put your name there, you know. I'm sorry. -What do you mean? -I'm sorry. Well, I'm sorry too, but I definitely don't wanna hug you. Hey, Tucker, are you in Washington D.C.? Tucker Carlson, write it down. Easy-squeezy. That's probably the most valuable-- Yeah, we got a celebrity endorsement. -Yeah. -You want some brownie? It's such a beautiful day out, today. The snow is glistening. When I look at you, am I lookin' at you for too long, or the right amount of time? Like, when I'm like... -What? -Oh, shit! A little bit more... No, these are not regular brownies. We have to pack this up. [Dan] Let's go in the rally and see what Bernie's all about. [announcement] The next President of the United States, Bernie Sanders! [crowd cheering] [Dan] It's so cool that Jen got us into VIP for this. [Bernie] The reason is we've treated the American people as intelligent human beings and we've told them the truth. We are dealing with a broken criminal justice system, kids get arrested for possessing marijuana... [crowd booing] Feel like we need more brownies. There's definitely something in it. -I think it's... -Marijuana. Yeah, that's what I was going to say. Yeah! [Bernie] ...public education should go through to college. People shouldn't have to pay for college. -No. -That makes sense. Feel like I'm gettin' more and more... Free health care, free college, they're like brownies. Everyone should have one. Bernie! Bernie! Bernie! Bernie! Bernie! Bernie! If they search your feet, you'll have different socks than when you came in... [both laughing] [Bernie] Wages in this country are too damn low. I think I stepped in a puddle. [Dan] I feel like what we have to do is figure out a way to get more brownies. We got to find a doctor and get a prescription. [indistinct chatter] [Dan] We're out of brownies, and I gotta be honest, these ideas are startin' to wear off. We got-- I'll be right back. Dr. Carson, I hate to bother you, could I get an autograph? Thank you. It's for my... for my girlfriend, Mary. Yeah, she's with us, Mary Jane. Yeah, thanks. Oh, that's so great. [John] What is it? He signed this prescription-- I mean, it's blank, so we can fill it out for whatever we want, really, but I guess if we need more brownies... we can make 'em. The ideas that we are fighting for are the ideas of the future of America. You have to put more Bernie in it. [both] Yeah! It's 22 minutes on 375 till we feel the Bern. [Bernie] Let me thank all of you for being part of the political revolution. [John] Tonight's show was awesome. It was amazing! [John] I loved when he played the top 10 percent... ...of the top one-tenth of one percent... We were due shows in four days... But then, he like, randomly got another show in Wiscon-- [crowd] Bernie! Are you guys watchin' us? Or am I watchin' you? [Bernie] ...and we are gaining momentum everyday. Yeah! [Dan] We should go to Bernie Man! That's probably the biggest show of the year. -Yeah, Bernie Man's happening in New York. -We should go. Are you goin' to the Bernie Sander's rally? Bernie Sanders? Who is he? -Oh, dude! -I'm not political. He's on his last tour... -Oh, no, no, no, no. -Come on. Come on. One, all right. -All right, we should get to Bernie. -Yeah. * Tearin' down the fences * Comin' to my senses * Seein' what I really know Hi. * And I giver her * Get you cross that river [Dan] Feel the Bernie! * I'm on a train to nowhere [Bernie] And I'm so inspired to see all of you here. Yeah! Tom Ribbons! This is what democracy looks like! [crowd cheering] The status-quo no longer works. Real change never occurs from the top on down, it's always from the bottom on up. [Dan] A little help. A little help, a little help... There is nothing we cannot accomplish. [crowd cheering] Will you pass me a brownie? Oh, no. I don't have anymore. But if you-- I need a brownie, so if you just give me one, then I'll have it. You give me one and then I'll give you-- I'll give you one, but you just give it right back. Let me just find one. I don't have anymore. Can you pass me one and-- Oh! I guess we got to find another candidate. Wait, we were on the Bernie tour for a month? -Yeah. -Wow! Have you ever played slap hand? -See, put your hands like that. -Okay. -Like this. -Yeah. -Then that. -Okay. Hey, guys... There's another Marco Rubio rally in, like, 20 minutes. Do you wanna go? Yeah, I'd go check him out again. Awesome, Dan? What? Do you wanna go to see Marco Rubio? Can you hear me with your small ears? I'm just kidding. -They are kind of small though. -I know, I never noticed that. They're just the regular size for a smaller person. They're cute. A lot of women, I'm sure, would like small ears. I'm kinda excited to see him again. -[Jen] Oh, yeah... He's so charismatic. -[indistinct chatter] -[Jen] Yeah. -[John] So, how far away is it? [Jen] Hmm, it's like 10 miles away. So, we will get there in time. [Dan] Did Jen say anything to you about meeting him or anything that? Or... Yeah, she said he's pretty cute. He's really good-looking. -He's kinda the total package, really. -Who is? -Rubio. -Yeah. Well... [crowd applauding] ...Senator Marco Rubio, soon to be President of the United States of America... [crowd chanting] [crowd applauding] On the eve of this very important election, not just for Florida, but an important election for our country. What is this election about? [distorted speech] Can you hear me with your small ears? Well, most elections are a choice between a political party and another-- That's enough! I have to tell everyone that Marco Rubio is tryin' to steal my girlfriend. He is, I-- They met in New Hampshire, and she doesn't look at me in the same way anymore. I don't see anymore love in her eyes, and he's-- I'm serious! He is using his power and his money, and-- Yeah, he's a little bit better-lookin' than me, and that's true. You-- You shouldn't vote for him, he's probably gonna steal your's too. He has a flexible immigration policy and people love it. Someone needs to take a stand. -You're right. -I have to use the bathroom. -This way. -I have to use the bathroom. -[Dan] Don't let him steal her. -Let's go. -Don't let him. -All right. -Don't let him steal my girlfriend... -[John] Dan! What happened? I-- I-- Someone had to say the truth. -Is that true? -Yeah. You saw, she said... She said, she... He's an ear-guy, okay? And I have... mine are small. I'll leave, I'll leave, I'll leave... Just like a love thing, you know what I mean? And I just think you should know, people should know. -[cop] Do you have weapons on you? -[Dan] No. No, no. Apparently, you're not allowed to accuse presidential candidates of tryin' to steal your girlfriend. I just wanted that. [Jen] You can't just interrupt presidential candidates as they're speaking. Like, we're not gonna be allowed back in, and now we're, like, a day behind schedule. I'm, yeah... I'm really sorry about that. So, there's this girl that I like, and I think she likes Marco Rubio, and I don't think he's good enough for her. 'Cause she's... She's really great, and... And I'm sorry. [John] I'm super pumped to go back to West Palm Beach. Kind of a big deal there. Actually, I worked here for a summer, they fired me after a couple of weeks, they accused me of stealing. I said I did, but I really didn't. Just, you know, wanted street cred. -Hey, Steve, how you doin'? -Ah, that's too bad! Hey, what's up? [sighs] That's harsh. I have experience. I know how to tell a good story and I think the best way to do it is to just step back and let them... And then, do you shave your penis? [John] Do I shave my own? -Yeah. -[John] Sometimes. I think that there is enough conflict and I think if we try to force it, it's gonna... What do you want me to do about it? No, I don't want to lose my job. West Palm is pretty cool, huh? Yeah, it is. -This building right here... -Yeah. ...is the Court House. It's where my dad works. I want to introduce you to him. [stammering] Hold on. Remember we talked about that whole testing you thing and if you go in there right now you're probably ruining the whole thing, you know? You're my friend, he's my dad, I want you guys to meet each other. -Yeah, you said-- -He's right here. Let's go say "hi." John? You mean a lot to me, I really don't want to go in there. I'm really sorry, I just... As a friend if you... -Okay. -Cool. What else should we do? -There's Downtown and the gardens. -Yeah? [John] Yeah, they got all sorts of shops. -Banana Republic, J Crew. -Cool. -Old Navy. -Yeah? West Elm. I don't mean it. And I had to get the fuck out of there because he's trying to sleep. Funny game we play. How do you stay so positive all the time? Well, you know, when I was young, my mom was really sad and somebody kind of had to smile for the two of us. So, that was me. -I'm sorry to hear that. -It's okay. -You know... -Yeah. So, what was it about you at the Court House with John? Oh, um... The truth is that I kind of lied to John to keep him on the show. I told him that I overheard you and his dad talking and that his dad actually wanted him to stay on the show. And... Sorry I lied to him. But, just please, please, please don't say anything. I won't, but, you told him that I talked to his dad? What? You said you won't say anything, so, that's fine. -I'm not going to say anything. -Okay. -But, don't do that, okay? -Sorry. I promise. Okay, I just... No, no, no, no, I didn't mean to... [laughs sheepishly] -It's okay. -Okay. So, it's okay when you do it. -Yeah. -I'm guess I'm trying to learn what... Okay, I promise. -It's almost decision time. -Yeah. Jen says we have to pick our candidate on-stage at the convention. They're going to air that episode the night before the election. -Ten million households-- -Waiting to see who we pick. [nervous laughter] I'm so nervous. -Don't be nervous. -Okay. -I just am though. -Yeah. We want to play for you something. This is Al Baldasaro. He is a Trump Campaign advisor, New Hampshire State Representative. This is him on the Jeff Queener show. If we could roll that sound. [Al] Hillary Clinton should be put in the firing line and shot for treason. Put in the firing line and shot for treason? -Hey. -How's it going? All right. -Thanks for joining us. -John. Okay, we'll have a little bit of fun. Yeah, I think so. -I'm a State Representative. -[both] Oh, cool. Donald Trump is the real deal. I support him 150 percent. We don't know much about him as we wish we did. Well, I'll give you an idea. I mean... What he said on banning Muslims. He didn't actually just say ban Muslims. He said ban Muslims until the system is fixed. So, if you don't know which ones are bad, it's easier to not let any of them in. -That's right. -And that's what Trump is saying? Yes, that's what he's saying. All the terrorists are Muslims. That are... You know, been attacking us here. Like that church in South Carolina, right? No, wait, there's a church in South Carolina... -There was a-- -There was a guy in Colorado. Yeah, in the movie theater line. I'm not sure whether he was a radical Muslim. No, I was talking about the planned parenthood guy. No, he was a sicko. -Oh, he was a sicko? -Yeah, he was sick. The Columbine shooters, I think there was a religious element. Now, let's talk about what he said about the Mexicans that they're killing, raping and murdering, all the stuff I'm talking about. But if you listen to what he said at the end of it. He said, "but not all Mexicans are bad." You know, he has Mexicans that are working for him. You have freedom of speech. I'm scared to say something now because we're worried that you might hurt somebody's feelings. I say tough shit. Can I say that? -I'll say it too, tough shit. -Tough shit. We've had hundreds and hundreds of volunteers that show up to help him. You think he's a strong candidate, that he's the strongest? Look. -Trump's strong. -Yeah. It's a good idea. You guys should do it. No, we don't do that. [both chanting] Trump Strong, Trump Strong. All right, that's fun. Trump Strong. I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose any voters, okay? Who would say that? How stupid are the people of Iowa? It's like he has no shame or pride. [laughing boisterously] -It's a joke. - I would bomb the [beep] out of them. -He's fearless. -And funny. Ah, I don't know what I said. I don't remember! If we're going to support Trump, we're not going to do it from the stands. We're going to be out there getting our hands dirty. What would Donald do? WWDD? -That was right. -Hmm. [John] Join Trump Strong and wear Trump Strong Armband with confidence. It is a symbol of strength, it is a symbol of unity. And most of all, it is the symbol of pride in your beliefs. -Do you want one to wear? -[Jen] I'm okay. It's almost like, remember World War II? Rosy the riveter. -Yeah. -You can do it. So, we made these armbands. And today we're going to walk around town and kind of show them off. It feels good, you know? -[John] I feel like I'm walking with a purpose now. -Wearing my heart on my sleeve. [John] I was actually thinking about going shirtless at the beach. -Yeah, just this. -Right. You guys making a movie? [John] Oh, yeah. They say Trump... Trump Strong. [John] I don't know, you could say it looks like that or it looks like Trump. -[John] No, I mean, I think pride is important. -Yeah. -All right, good luck with the movie. -Have a good one, guys. -Trump Strong. -That was kind of weird. Are you going to give it back? Yeah, we just have the one. [Carl] Just a moment ago, we met a couple of guys who were walking down the sidewalk and had armbands. Trump armbands. It's not the kind of thing you normally see. Buttons, bumper stickers, occasionally t-shirts. But, armbands is a fairly new phenomenon in American Presidential politics. We ran into this guy. Guess he was a news reporter or something like that. And he said he wanted to put them on the air. He told a lie on TV and said that we said we got them from the Trump campaign. Two guys said that they were being passed out by the campaign and that they were free. And it had this feel of sort of fascist militant attire. That's just kinda weird. Hey guys, uh... We're heading out in five minutes. I got us great seats at a Trump Town Hall. -That's great. -Awesome. -Thanks, Jen. -I'll see you there. I'll be in the production van following you guys. Hey, this isn't what Trump would want us to do? -Okay. -He wouldn't want us to be waving flags, being cheerleaders. He'd want us to take action! Yeah. So, what do we do? [whispering] [anchor] Lots at stake here in the Republican race today. Is Donald Trump in for a big night? Can Rubio and Kasich win their home states? [indistinct chatter] [announcement on PA] Donald J. Trump. [crowd applauding] Hello, everybody. So, thank you all for being here. This is really amazing. I mean, we're coming to the end of a beautiful, beautiful journey. It's going to be a very big day for the nation. And we're going to see. What do you think? We're going to do well? Make America great again? It was win or go home night for Governor Kasich and he achieved his goal by winning Ohio. [crowd cheering] Kasich is going nowhere. Nowhere, nowhere, nowhere. I have never seen a human being eat in such a disgusting fashion. You better believe it. You better believe it's about America-- You got to drop out. You got to make room for a real candidate. You got to drop out. Come on, it's best for America. Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump. Come on, guys, it's the right thing to do! The big headline here in Florida is that Senator Marco Rubio did not have much of the support of voters. With a double-digit loss to Donald Trump, he decided to suspend his campaign. Ladies and Gentlemen, please welcome Senator Marco Rubio. [crowd howling and cheering] I just want you to know, there's nothing more you could have done. Little Marco, little Marco. He couldn't be elected dog catcher. It really began back in 2007. [John] You lost, Marco. You lost, little Marco. Trump for President. Everybody needs to follow Donald Trump. Trump for President. Hey, there's my hat. Hey, hey, we're going for Trump. Hey, I need my hat back, I need my hat. Trump, Trump, follow me. Follow me. You lost, you loser! [John] It's the classy thing to do. He's gotta drop out and he's got to make room for someone who can really win. Trump, Trump. A lot of people are saying there might be a connection. [Trump] I wouldn't mention that. You know, it takes guts to run for President. [Jen] They did what? [Trump] I've never done this before and I'm enjoying it... Listen, guys. When you say you're going to be somewhere, you have to be there. We're on a tight schedule and we can't afford to have you guys going to different events. When we all say we're going to meet at the Trump Town Hall... Look, I'm sorry, honey. We were just doing what Trump would have wanted us to do. Sweetheart, we had to, okay? We like Trump now, and we have to let them know to their faces-- That they're losers and it's really terrific. -And, and, and-- -Everything else is sad. -Every other candidate. -[both] You're fired, you're fired. I'm not filming you with those on. -What? -Are you serious? Take those off, they're so offensive. [people clamoring] [woman chanting] U.S.A! U.S.A! [woman] You're fucking racist. Lose some weight! Oh, man, just look at him. -[man screaming] Donald! -We love you. [excited grunts] That was great. We settled on a Monday morning and you're packed. And it's like that all over again. We have a lot of things to talk about. Trump is leading 26 Cruz 24 in the rest of them are... Bingo! [John laughing] Some of those zeros, what are they doing? [John] Get out of here! Basically how to fix the problems? Elect Trump as President. -[crowd cheering] -[John] Obama, you're fired. Obama, you're fired. -[applause] -That's right, President Obama-- Obama, you're fired! [both chanting] Obama, you're fired! [Trump] Thank you. I've got an enthusiastic person. Oh, here's a good one. Just came out. Against Clinton, Hillary Clinton. [crowd booing] Hillary for prison! Hillary for prison. Hillary for prison! ...Hillary for prison. [laughing] We will build a wall... [crowd cheering] Who's gonna pay for the wall? Who? [crowd chanting] Hope all is well and that you had a wonderful Holiday season. Happy New Year, Amanda. [John] This isn't even funny anymore. He stopped telling his jokes. Would you have lunch with me at my club? He has a club, nice club. I had a hamburger. I said I'll tweet it. So, I put out a tweet. He's super low energy, right? Super, he's super low. Super low energy! That's a good thing and that's a good thing. We need strong energy. It's time to do something about it. [John] Sit down and shut up! [both] This is boring. We're bored. Tell us some jokes, something, entertain us. We're bored. Come on. Are you kidding me? We're bored. Get him out of here. -Are you serious? This is boring. -This is boring! We came here to be entertained. [Trump] There's nothing funny about it. I want to be entertained. -This is boring. -Out, out! [John] So boring. Get out of here. He's got a very serious problem. I love Donald, but he's so freaking boring. It's getting a little old. I want a few jokes. -Wow. -This appeared to be one of the supporters too. -I mean, he's wearing a hat. -Does the heckler have a point? During a Donald Trump rally yesterday, a man was kicked out for yelling, "this is boring." [laughter] Hey, guys. -Hey. -[Jen] Hey. You look so sad. What's wrong? Oh, I don't know. Seeing all these candidates. It just seems hopeless. You haven't seen everybody yet. There's still one candidate left. Okay, what's his deal? Only you should say that. It's actually not a "he." Oh, is it like a trans? As long as those trans people stay out of the bathroom. -That's all I care about. -No, you have to use the bathroom. You guys, the first female President. That's exciting, right? -Yeah. -I think so. -Okay. -All right, great. Oh, I just thought about Donald Trump. I got to lay down. Yeah, even for a second. Oh my God. He is so fucking boring. [Jen] It's on the side of the show. It's like a kind of bipartisan coverage of what's going on with the elections. [woman] Undecided though. [Jen] Yeah, I know. That's why I'm having them talk to you. -[Jen] This is Karina. -[John] Hello. She's a Hillary supporter. We've seen all the candidates. -Mm-hmm. -So, we are trying to figure out who we want. And you're obviously for Hillary. Why should we vote for her? You should vote for Hillary because I think, um... Women should have a voice. We're overdue to have a woman President. -Right. -She's been in the White House in a different role. She's been working for the American people to get health care, to represent disabled folks, children, women. We could have something new as opposed to the same old thing, but still at the same time kind of... Same old thing, yeah. It's not exciting, but, it's like a reasonable choice. Yeah, that is reasonable. You feel totally comfortable thinking about everyone and then settling for Hillary? Oh, yeah. Hillary is our lady. -I guess I'll settle on Hillary. -Thank you! -Thank you for your support. -Yeah, I'll settle for Hillary. Guys, why not settle for Hillary? Everyone else is too crazy, right? Settle for Hillary, okay? Settle for Hillary? Who else could you possibly vote for? She's the least bad out of everyone. [man] The least bad? Oh, true. We were with Trump for a little bit. He's a snooze fest. Disappointingly boring. [chanting] Settle for Hillary. I mean, she's fine, whatever right? Could be worse, could be better. For sure though, could be worse. We put up with so much crap and finally we settled for Hillary. We're still putting up with crap... Hope you guys settled on Hillary Clinton. You want to settle for Hillary? -They're making us leave? What's do you mean? -Let's just go. I don't know. I guess I don't really care. I'd rather get dinner. Hillary Clinton is running for President. I agree. We're just going to go there tonight, you know, to her rally and just kind of show... -Our presence. -Yeah. [choir singing "America the Beautiful"] [woman] Former President Bill Clinton here. [John] Oh, yeah, that guy. He would say, "are people better off when..." The children have a brighter future. How about coming together instead of being torn apart? Hillary Rodham Clinton. [John] Why not? [Hillary] Hello! Thank you all. Thank you so much... Imagine what we can do together. Imagine an economy, very much like what we did have in the 1990s. [John] I'll settle for that. Settle for Hillary! [man] Excuse me, if you could just follow me? We're not really comfortable with the message there. We're for Hillary. We're for Hillary. I don't understand why we're getting kicked out for voting for her. I feel like he's against Hillary or something. [Dan] I'd love to give her a shirt if she would... I'll take it from you if you want and give it to her, sure. Promise you're going to give that to her? I don't know, just head out. Security guy got mad, but he asked for a shirt and said he'll give it to Hillary. So I think we're getting the word out. I think it's going to work out. [Jen] Great. Oh, you're peeing. Okay. I'm really proud of you guys for picking a candidate. -Yeah. -Yeah, sure. But I also want to see your excitement. This has been a long process. And it'll be really helpful to have the audience get a sense of your excitement. -Okay. -That makes sense, actually. We should go 100 percent. We'll turn up the volume a little bit. Well, by turning up, don't go overboard. -Going overboard? -Yeah. -You know just-- -We're just going to show our support. -Okay, cool. -Okay. Yeah, sure. -Great. -We'll try. [howling] We have bridges that are right now too dangerous to drive on although people take a deep breath and drive across them. We finally found a candidate to settle for. We're gonna settle for Hillary Clinton. That's right. [news anchor] Clinton distracted by shirtless men at rally. The Daily Mail did it in true British tabloid fashion. Hot for Hillary. People haven't necessarily noticed that it's always the same two guys. But now, here's the news. The Clinton Campaign has decided to make these guys part of their campaign effort. [crowd cheering] Okay, so, as I was saying... So, what to make of this? I don't know what you want me to say. What do you want me to do? What do you want me to do? All right, fine, fine. You want conflict? I will fucking give you conflict. [John] I think, listen. You like Jen right? Yeah, I love her. Then you need to tell her how you feel before we end this. Or you're going to regret it for the rest of your life. Go to her hotel room and just speak from the heart. I'm really scared though because what if she doesn't feel the same way? You'll always miss 100 percent of the shots you don't take. I never made a shot. -You keep it. -Thanks. Hey, there you are. Mind if I join you? Oh, yeah, sure. Why aren't you back at the hotel? I don't know. I just wanted to be out and about... Hey, can I a get a beer and two shots of tequila? -Yeah. -Thank you. That is unpleasant. I know, I don't drink a lot. I do, I drink a fair amount. That's why I wanted... Maybe just have, you know, one shot and call it... Are you sure? You don't want just one more shot? See where the night takes us? -You already hesitated... Yes. -You're gonna have one more? So, this is crazy. I wanted to tell you something. It's not a big deal. But... You know how Dan told you that I've spoken with your father? Yeah, yeah, yeah, my dad's, like, doing... -...the test. -Yeah, it never... It didn't happen. How is that possible? Then, what happened there? Dan lied? -That upsets you? -It upsets me that he would lie. That has consequences for my family. So, then, just don't even think about it right now. Tomorrow is another day, and then, that's when you guys can... Just doesn't seem like Dan. -To friendship. -To friendship. -Let's get out of here. -Yeah. I had -eight tequila shots? -Yeah. -Right here. -Okay. -Do you mind if I lie down? -No, of course. -You'll feel better that way. -I feel like I'm gonna go. Jen, I wanted to say that I like you and I noticed that you have a done a lot of nice things for me and I haven't tried to do a lot of nice things for you, and I brought these because I think that we would be better together. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Dan. What... [solemn music playing] Dan! -That's a joke right? -What? Your email. No, you're fired. -I don't understand. -You're fired. I did everything you asked me to do. What I asked you to do was put a wedge between them and make them fight with each other. That's how TV works. I did exactly what you said. I put a wedge between them. Really? When did you do that? Dan has a little bit of a crush on me, and so, I made him think that I hooked up with John. [scoffs and chuckles] I mean, that's really fucked up. Technically, that is awesome. Thank you. Okay, good. So, then I'll just finish the... No, you won't. They're gonna finish this project. -It's gonna be fine-- -Who's "they"? The investors, they will put together whatever-- Put them on the phone, let me talk to them. You're not gonna talk to the investors, Jen, okay? They are these offshore guys. They've got tax deals, it's their thing. Okay, look, they are gonna cut this together. You're gonna be very proud whatever version they end up using. What do you mean "whatever version"? ...you're gonna be really proud of it. What do you mean "whatever version"? Okay, look, I would just drop it, all right, champ? Dan is not my friend. Dan is a liar. John can go suck a turd. -So, Jen quit. -What? Did she say anything or where she was... Yeah. She said something. She said that one of you made her uncomfortable. Okay? I'm not gonna say which one of you because I'm cool like that. The good news is Jen is gone. The better news is I'm your new daddy. Okay. So you're gonna listen to me now. We're gonna go to John Kasich's rally tonight. Is it Kasick or Kasich? -We don't know. -Yeah, nobody knows. Nobody cares, he is not gonna win. Here is the point, big celebrity introducing him, all right? Maury Povich, I think. Okay? So we're gonna go there, Morgan Freeman is introducing him, we're gonna cover that. Danny, you're riding in the RV. Johnny, coming with me in the Batmobile. -Let's go. -Yeah, get out of the RV. Liar. I'm the RV guy. I can do anything I want. Your dad, West Palm Beach, big Republican City Council? I like that guy. Good family values. Hey, what do you think of Dan? You think he's really undecided? Or is he a democrat? You got something in your teeth. Let's go. I'm not settling for Hillary. ...not had a Presidential candidate visit our community of Bay Ridge since Gerald Ford in 1976. So, we're real excited to have Governor Kasich with us today. And I have the great opportunity of introducing a very special guest who is joining us today. Without further ado, I'd like to welcome Montel Williams. I wanna explain to you why I'm here tonight. -Montel, Montel... -Yeah? Just before we go I just want to let you know that guy in white shirt is a democrat. -No, you can stop now. -No, he is a democrat. And he been saying things around town about my family. -No, no, no, well. look-- -Yes, he has. -That's not true. No, no, no. -That's correct. You've been talking about my dad. Hey, hey, you used to be my best friend... Quiet! -Tell them what you did. -I didn't do anything. -Okay, I was drunk. -He made love to a girl... ...who I cared about. That's not true. Robust foreign policy, that's all he cares about. That's bullshit. No, no, no. You could say I don't care about this? Hey, let me get out of here! Let's go, go! White trash! White trash! You have to live what you did. I'm a Republican, I should stay! I'm undecided. You don't go away for free. Typical democrat! I'm undecided. You're a democrat! I know you're a democrat! Come on, they're gonna go, you gotta hurry. [laughing] That was awesome. What made everyone so weird and sad that they had to come out here? Carly? I don't know what my question is... Can I have a hug? I miss my friend Daniel a lot. -You have faith, all right? -Yeah, thank you. Yes! Here's the thing. This whole place, owned by one of our investors. They got one in every capital now. It's crazy. That's a lot. Danny, you are a sharp guy. -No. -Yeah, you're a sharp guy. He tried to hold me back one year... No, but this... What I'm trying to say is, do you wanna be the next American hero? -Yeah, it sounds good. Yeah. -Hero, right? Okay, look, take this. -What is this? -Just... -put it in your pocket. -Okay. -Oh, gosh. Okay. -No. -Take a puzzle... -Just pick it up. Pick up. Here, put it in your pocket. -Yeah. Okay. -Put it in there, all right? Now, look, there's more where that came from. So, let me tell you a little secret. The people who are doing the show, they think the democrats are the good guys, which is good for you because it means you're gonna be -the hero. -The hero. Sp, what I need you to do when the finale happens and then when this show airs right before the election, I need you to make a decision -Yeah. -Here. -You're gonna decide... -I'm gonna decide... -The blue hat, the blue shirt. -Right. -Right? -Okay. -What about John? -He'll be fine. So, Jen introduced us to Roger today, -Really nice guy. -Yeah. He, apparently, represents the investors. Politics brings people together. They're gonna finish this project. Whatever version they end up using. Larry, how you doing, buddy? You know, I never thought I'd see the day when half the country jumps when you snap your fingers, you motherfucker. Bill, how are you pal? Can you believe you're running the show over there already? Well, I'd thought you were a fuck up, but, you know, who knows. Hey, fuck you. Okay, listen to me, listen to me. We've been radio silent on this so far, okay. But we've got a product, and I think it's gonna be very interesting to you. Listen to me, it is a Truman show... ...meets Circus... ...meets Forrest Gump... ...meets Citizen Kane. Right? Have I got your attention? Ten million households... ...falling in love with your guy... ...and hating their guy. Forget their one percent, this is the one percent that will determine the election, delivered to you on a platter. You know what we want. That's... It does sound like a small price to pay for the presidency, you're right. I'm glad you're interested. Look at this, you got the bathroom, you got the king-size bed, you got the flat-screen TV, this is way better than that -stupid RV, am I right? -Yeah, the RV sucks. You know I've been looking at you and Dan, John. Doesn't seem like you guys are getting along. Yeah. I mean, Dan, he lied to me. -Yeah. -He's a liar. I think it's maybe he just doesn't share our values. -Our values? -Yeah. I don't like him. I don't trust him. I thought he was my best friend for a little bit. No. I'm going to propose something to you. Now, wait till you think about this very carefully. But not for too long. You want to be the next American Idol? -Yes. Yes, I do. -Yes. I think they canceled it. This is the last season. No, I don't mean literally the American Idol, I mean it's a metaphor. Here, maybe this will explain it. That's for you. Take it. You're gonna be the hero of this show. -Jen, what are you doing here? -Look, I'm sorry. No, no, no, no, no! Sit down. Please sit down for just one second. I just want... I want to apologize, Well, I don't know how I can trust you, I knew that if I ever saw you again I wanted to say, -darn you. -I'm sorry. -Well, you slept with John. -I didn't slept with John. There was a sock, and... I made it look like I slept with John just to get you guys fighting. I was under a lot of pressure. And if I could have done it over, I would have stood my ground, or left earlier, but I didn't. But why would they wanna drive us apart? Dan, if you either one of you chose as a candidate, the investors will have all the footage that they need to make whatever version of the show they want. They are planing to make one of you look like the biggest asshole on the planet. What do you mean? There he told me I was gonna be -a hero. -Yeah, they were just saying whatever they needed to say to get you on board. How do I know you're telling me the truth right now? We have to stop John from going in that rally. -Are you with me? -Yeah. -All right, then let's go. -I am. Are we gonna get in trouble for this? I'm a little scared, but I don't mind it. Where is Dan? Why is he not at the event? You lost him? [chanting] Donald Trump! The clowns are chasing me. [chanting continues] John. Rick, hey. You shouldn't have dropped out, you know. You're really disappointed my friend, John. He was so bugged. -That's very kind. Thank you. -All right. Okay. Thanks. You know where John Nelson is? I gotta find him. John. John. -Dan? -John, I'm so sorry. -I lied to you. -You shouldn't be here. I shouldn't have done that. Please, you gotta hear me out. They're trying to drive us apart. Okay? -They're telling us these lies. -Dan, I've made my decision. I just wanted you to stay on... -You need to go, Dan. -Please. John. ...and operate on the premise that it's your money, you pay the lowest tax rate you possibly can pay, and then you decide what you wanna do with it instead of the... John, you gotta hear me out. okay? -What? -I'm sorry I lied to you. I'm sorry I lied, but they're trying to drive us apart. No, no, no, no. They're trying to get power, and influence ans it's all about the money. Money? You took money. I did, but I don't care about it. This whole thing was about money for you. -That's the whole reason you... -I don't care about the money. I don't care about it. I don't care about the money. Okay? I don't even care about it. What? -Y ou know what? -No. I don't care about it either. I just want to be friends. -Fuck! -They're trying to drive us apart. It's Roger is who it was. Motherfuckers! He took us to his hotel room, he gave us money, he made me do things I'd never do. It was Roger. He took me to a fancy country club and he offered me money, to do disgusting things. Listen, I saw it. I'm gonna get to the bottom of this. It's gonna be fi... What do you mean I'm fired? I'm fired. -I missed you so much! -I missed you! John, don't let 'em drive us apart. I don't care about your political... I don't care that you're poor. Thank you so much! You're my best friend in the whole world. So, we kinda ruined the show. Yeah, they can't use any of that footage after what we pulled. -Roger was so mad. Yeah. -He sued us. So, my mom and I lost the house. My mom was pretty mad, but she showed up everyday to court with me. Then John's dad offered to represent us. Yeah, in a weird way, it kinda helped me and my dad reconnect. And it actually helped my mom meet John's dad, they were at court everyday together. They fell in love, so now, we all live here. She's got a great big house. And I finally found out what my dad was running for. And it sounds like an awesome job, I decided to run. Hi, everyone, my name is John Nelson and I'm here to announce that I am running for Congress in the great state of Florida, the Sunshine State. What... No. Vote Nelson! 2016! And I'm his campaign manager. It's just like being a hockey equipment manager, I still have people telling me what to do all the time. -Gimme that drink. -Oh, sure. You said you were a little sick. Yeah, I'm not feeling well. My dad's running as Republican, I guess this other guy's running as a democrat. So, I'm running as a dependent. It's independent. Independent. Yeah, and we have the smartest PR department ever. It turns out all those interactions we had with the candidates made for a pretty awesome YouTube channel. Jen made a pretty good use of that footage. -Yeah, she stole it. -Hey. I took the footage because I'm thinking about showing people what really happened. Am I gonna vote for John? I don't know, but there's one thing I'm not undecided about. We're gonna stay friends. Yeah, we're not gonna let a whole bunch of political issues drive us apart. -John! -Oh, shit. I gotta go! You goddamn indepedent. John's dad is pretty upset with him all over again, you know, 'cause he's running against him and everything. We thought he'd be proud, but it did not work out that way. My shoes, my shoes, my shoes. John Nelson, 2016. I just think this election's gonna be so fun. -[woman] Dan? -Mom? Yeah, no. I'm sorry. Yeah, I forgot. -I didn't start the mac and cheese. -It's fine. No, it'll be done really fast, mom. -The fastest ever! -All right. We can cut, guys. Justin? How are you doing? -How are you? -My name is John. -Pleasure to see you. -Uh, nice to see you. Could I shake your hand as well? I wanted to know, could you run for president here? Actually, it's very simple. I'm not an American boy. -Ted Cruz. -Ted Cruz. Yeah. No, but he was born as an American. Yeah, but all our guys are so bad. You gotta believe us. We met 'em all. They're so terrible. They're either boring, weird, you have to settle for them. We'll do anything. We're begging you. -We will literally beg you. -We're begging you. -We will literally beg you. -We're begging you. -Please, run for president. -Seriously, please run for president.
