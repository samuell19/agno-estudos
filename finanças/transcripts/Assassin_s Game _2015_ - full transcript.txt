Um... There should have been... There should have been... Woulda. Shoulda. Coulda. Come here! You give me one reason... Huh? ...why I shouldn't blow your motherfucking brains out. It didn't... It was... We've done a lot of good work for you! We've done a lot of good work for you! Please! -Did you know... -You're gonna blow it all... Do you know how important this job was? Because if you did... then why'd you fuck it up? Huh? Why'd you fuck it up? We... We didn't fuck it up. Rhetorical question, asshole. Now, either you're incompetent, or you're in on it. Either way, you're of no use to me. Just give us... Please, please, please! Just give us one more shot. Oh, I'm... Are you out of your fucking mind? When we took out Gerber, were we of use to you then? What the fuck are you doing out of the kitchen? Please, just... Just give us a chance to redeem ourselves. Redeem? Talk about redemption with God, cocksucker. Don't bring that shit in here with me. Books. Bullshit, right? Books? Ain't nothing you're learning in here that's gonna help you out there, right? This one's interesting though. Come here. Let me show you something. Come here. Somebody get this faggot out of here right now. Get this faggot out of here right now, or I'm gonna put a bullet in his fucking goddamn head. Where's my money? Do you got my money? Hey, Vet, how you doing? Keeping busy I hear. What do you want, Viejo? Ah, shit. I got a job I want you to do. Okay? I got a target... 24 hours, in a warehouse. After that, they're in the wind, they're gone forever. I got my ass on the line on this. I need your help. I'm retired. Huh. But your son and his friends aren't, are they? Are they? But they will be... permanently... if you decide not to do this. Why don't you get Emmett here to do it? He's chomping at the bit as usual. Well, happiness is a warm gun. Who is it? Is that what this is about? You know how it goes. What are the terms? Simple. Take out the target, and you and the Three Stooges are free to go. I'll send two of my men with you to observe you. They'll notify me when you've accomplished the mission, and the matter's closed. Then you go back to your job cleaning assholes or whatever the fuck it is you do. I'm sorry, this shit is just funny, toilet man. And if I refuse? You're still free to go, but these three guys... they're doing this shit for the last time. It's the end of the line for them. Time's ticking. Yes. Everybody hear that? We got witnesses. An oral agreement is a binding contract. I just read that here. So word is bond. What the fuck are you doing here? Get the fuck out of here! Cocksuckers! Shit. Not me. Don't fuck me. I'll kill your son. Pull over. I gotta take a leak. It can wait. Pull over. I gotta take a leak. Follow him. They say you're the best that ever was, huh? Well, that may be... but a lot of good that did Dahmer, when they caught him. Didn't help Bundy neither. All I'm saying is, time... waits for no man. And you look like you lost a step or two. No offense. I'm just saying... you look a little sloppy. What the hell's he doing? Taking a shit? I thought he said he was taking a leak. He's taking a dump, boss. And? So what do you want me to do? Nothing. I'm gonna kill you. You, let's go. Come on. Stay here. Hey. Yo, Henry, where you at? Fuck! What the fuck? -What are you doing? -Don't worry about it. El Viejo's gonna flip out. Fuck him. What the fuck happened? He decided he would kill those two motherfuckers back there. Why the fuck you do that? You might as well have left us where you found us. You're welcome. Are you at least gonna tell us what the fuck is going on? I'm retired. I don't kill people anymore. So... so what now? So now we find the target and we get her to safety. Wait, what? I don't think you know who El Viejo is. I mean, he will literally chase us down to the ends of the earth. Stop talking, slick. So instead of finishing that bitch off, we're gonna rescue her? Fuck that. One full magazine. That's it. Don't waste it. -You stay here. -I'm coming with. No, you're staying here. What for? There's nothing to do here. There's plenty to do here, and it will be safe. I don't wanna be safe. Are you suicidal? Yeah. Fine, but do it here. Let's go. Okay, you guys go. I'll cover your asses. Alone. They're here boss, alone. Kill 'em all. Get the target. You hear me? Kill 'em all! Get the target. Bye-bye, bitch. Man, this place is fucking huge. She could be anywhere. If she's even here. Why don't we just call out to her? What the fuck is wrong with you? You think we're alone? You go left. You go right. I'll be upstairs. We'll meet back here. Get it done. Hey. We got company. Any word? No one's answering, but I'll keep trying. Okay. It was fantastic. Oh, honey, of course we missed you. It's never the same without you. Of course I do. How could I stay mad at you? Charlotte told me to tell you, "Hi." Are you... asking me out on a date, sir? I can't think of anything better. Love you too. Jerk. Crazy. This diamond ring could feed an entire village in Africa for a year. It's so beautiful. Thank you. And it's from there. Yeah. You like what you do? My father was in the military. Brother, uncle... It's all I've ever known. So you always wanted to be a soldier? No. I want to be a... princess. Chinese princess. No. Just a princess. Well, I have everything I've ever wanted: Money, jewelry, cars. I am living my dream. But it's not enough. No. Why? I don't know. 'Sup, girl? You know where I can find a pool around here? No. They said it was in this area. I was hoping maybe you could help me find it. Do you know who the fuck I am? Shit. Don't mind me. I had a long night. So what's up? You just chilling? Yeah, nothing. My name's Clayton by the way. -Ruby. -Ruby? I like that. And you are gorgeous. Typical dumb broad. See, you give a girl a couple compliments, and she melts right in your damn hands. The key to my ass... Little Missy got some moves, huh? -Show me what you got. -You ready for this? You done fucked with the wrong person today. Come on! The hell's wrong with you, huh? -Give me the gun. -No, he's done. I had him. What are you doing? I had him. You don't see me up in your business, do you? What are you even doing out here? Go fucking help your son and Mack. From now on, there's a chain of command. You don't talk to me directly. You need something, you talk to Junior, Junior talks to me. What makes you think you can make these rules up? You're not the boss of me. I'm my own boss. I don't know who the fuck you think you are, old man, but this ain't the '50s anymore. You're not needed. What? You can't touch a girl? You murder people for a living, deary. Chivalry is dead. You killed it, literally. Hey! Don't you ever put your hands on my girl again. I wouldn't have to if she had a real man. Oh, yeah? Who's your real man... Okay. All right. Yeah. Yeah, you're a real man, walking out on Mom and me like you did. Come on, let it all out. You know, I fucking hated you growing up. I wanted nothing to do with you. I hated you then, and I fucking hate you now. Whatever. Shut up. Get your head back in the game. Where is Mack? He should be here by now. Where the hell is he? Let's go. Emmett. -Emmett. -What's up, man? Are you familiar with the Massacre of Thelonicus? No, not at all. Really? Not at all? Not at all, man. Listen to this. "The anger of the emperor "rose to the highest pitch, and he gratified his vindictive desire "for vengeance by unsheathing his sword "most unjustly and tyrannically against all, "slaying the innocent and the guilty alike. "It is said 7,000 perished without any forms of law "and without even having judicial sentence passed upon them; "but that, like ears of wheat in the time of harvest, "they were alike... cut down." So the emperor sounds like a real dick. I mean, what are you trying to say? You want me to kill everybody? I get it. Exactly what I'm saying. Let it come. Deep breath. Breathe out. What the fuck are you doing? - I'm interrogating him. - By torturing him? You sick fuck. What is wrong with you? Oh, man, you've gone soft. Fucking psycho. The fuck you do that for? He had Intel. For the remainder of our time in this warehouse, your decision-making privileges are suspended. Now, if you two did your jobs... my target should be somewhere upstairs. Let's find her and get the hell out of here. Can't let you leave. I have to go, Tony. You know too much. I won't talk. You know me better than that. I would never do that. Take it up with the big boss. There's nothing left for me here. Please. I'm sorry. No. I'm sorry. It's that bitch from the desert. Let's fuck her up. Hold on. We flank her end, easy breezy CoverGirl. No, we're not gonna do that. -Why not? -Because she's not the enemy. I'm pretty sure that she's the one firing at us right now. She's protecting the target, the same thing we're doing. We're not gonna kill her for that. Sir, I'm pretty sure... Hey, pretty sure means shit to me. You know what it means? It means I got a half a piece of ass. All right, "pretty sure" means that I don't know what's going on. All right? I want confirmed kills, all right? Get me confirmed kills. Go. Send more men. Hey, Vet, the toilets are on their way. You can clean them tomorrow, okay? Let it come. Copy. She's fucking crazy. Let's quit jerking around and take this fucker out. All right, Mack and I are gonna go around. We'll take her out from the side, okay? Let's go. We're not murdering this woman. Not now, not ever. Get it through your goddamn heads! What was that for? Just ringing the doorbell. What the hell was that? It's World War III. How many did he send? All of them. Anything I can do to help? Be careful. I'm going after the target. Go back to the base. Take defensive positions. Do not engage. I'll be back as soon as I can. Let's go. Be smart. Hands. -Hands! -You got me. Everyone's time to come, I suppose. You always dress like this when you're being hunted? Put this on. This ain't no bathing beach. You're not gonna kill me? No. Let's go. Freeze, faggot. On your knees. Hands in the air. Well, well, well. If it isn't the man, the myth, the legend himself. Remember me, dipshit? You should have killed me when you had the chance. Yo, Henry, get your butt up here. I got dibs! This is gonna be interesting. I'm gonna skin this motherfucker... alive. Use him as a carpet. You know... some people have... tigers for rugs. Some people have bears for rugs. Only... I'm gonna have Vet Jones for a rug. When are we gonna do her? Oh, we're gonna do her all right. We're gonna do her... and then we're gonna do her again. And when we do her again... she's gonna be... done. Any last words for you, dipshit? How about... "I, Vet Jones, have been conquered "by Henry the IX." - That's got a nice ring to it. - I like it. That's good. How about... How about... "Henry the IX is my lord and sovereign... "and I am honored to die by his..." Come on. Come on. Go, go. Who are you? I'm gonna stash you in here. Why are you doing this? Would you rather I didn't? -No. -Then don't worry about it. Can you tell me something? I'm at least entitled to that. -You are? -Yeah. I don't know what's going on. Good. Can you at least tell me your name? What difference does it make? Well, what should I call you? Don't call me. If I need something, I'll call you. -In here. -In there? -It ain't the Ritz. -O-okay. It ain't the... None of this would have happened, and we wouldn't be here right now if we'd just stayed. Stayed home? This is really what this is all about? You want me barefoot and pregnant, that's it? You don't want a strong woman that will call you out on your bullshit? Well, fuck you, 'cause this is not who I am. You have a problem with that? What? Junior? We're coming out right now. Where's your friend? He went off on his own. We haven't seen him since. Thanks. Let's go. Hey. We're not done. I need you for something. You up for it? What is it? Guard her. What are you guys gonna do? We're gonna go find Mack. Can you handle it? Aye. Where have I seen you two before? We tried to kill you a few days ago. Sorry about that. Yeah, your bodyguard shot me. You all right on ammo? Inside. In there? Yeah, where else? No fucking way. Ruby, come on. Hey, why don't you get in, Junior? Or better yet, why don't you get in? I'll go find Mack. It's for your own safety. I can keep myself safe. The lioness does the hunting, in case you've forgotten. All right, let's go. A lioness hunts... while the lion sits on his ass. What? How's the arm? What do you care? I asked, didn't I? Look. You can skip the small talk, okay? Sitting in a toilet. Classy. Excuse me? I don't sit in shit for no men. Well, good for you, but that man just saved my life. Doesn't mean you have to do whatever he says. Yes, it does. See, I don't question shit in the middle of an operation. You stink. So? I'll take a shower. A shower cannot fix this stink. You done fucked up now, boy. You got one shot. Make it count. Come on. There we go. Come on, it's almost over. You're all right. You're all right. You're all right. Come on. Stand up. Stand up. Stand up. Stand up. If you give them an inch, they take a mile. You have to challenge men every step of the way, or they lose respect for you. What? You just have a disease, that's all. It's called early 20s bougie bitch issues. Wow. When did you come up with that? While you were sitting in the toilet? No, it's written all over your face. You scream it every time you open up your mouth. Okay. -You wanna settle this... -Like men? No, thank you. Say what? Nothing, bitch. When is your sex-change operation scheduled? Hmm? As I was saying... women are stronger than men. That's what you don't understand. Whatever, Ruben. Mack? Mack! -We should bury him. -No. I'm gonna bury him out back. The cops will just dig him up again. He was my friend! I can't just leave him here. This is where he belongs. He died like he lived. Let him rest in peace. Let's go. It can't be like this. It is exactly like this. There are no 21-gun salutes in this business. Now, find Ruby and wait for me. Where are you going? To end it. Shut up. I don't want to hear you anymore. No worries, a strong man will come and save you, fragile woman. Hey, baby. What happened? It's Mack. He's dead. What? How? They shot him. Why didn't you save him? You should have saved him! Got there too late. Where is he? I want to see him. You can't. It's not safe. I don't care. I have to see him. -Ruby. -No, I don't care. I have to see him! -Where is he? -We have to stay here. We're moving out in minutes. I don't care. Where is he? Listen, please. Stop shrieking. I'm not shrieking, and don't you dare tell me what to do. Fine! I'll find him myself. -I'm coming with you. -Don't. I want to be alone. She just doesn't listen! I know. You know? What is it you know? Hmm? You said, "I know." What is it that you know? Well, I was just... agreeing with you. I know she doesn't listen. You don't know anything. What could you possibly know about my girlfriend? In fact, what are you doing outside of your toilet? I was just trying to tell you what she told me. What did she tell you? Nothing. She's just, uh... -strongheaded, that's all. -What did she tell you? Specifically. Speak, woman! She said... she wears the pants. -You know what? -Wait! What? Okay. Stay put. Emmett! Not Emmett. Emmett! Emmett! Emmett! Drum. What's up, janitor? Welcome back. -You gonna play with me? -You're a sick fuck. What's that make you, huh? What's that make you? An angel? I'm not a pimple on your ass when it comes to killing. Isn't that what you used to say? Oh, wait, you retired. Yeah, that's right. So what does that... does that clean the slate? All this carnage is your fault. Yeah, you broke that contract, so you're the reason why all this is happening. It's blood on your hands. You're even more destructive now than you were when you're... when you were in your prime, man. And you retired. What the fuck does that say? -This ends here. -Yeah, of course it does. I know it ends today. But I'm gonna give you an option. I'm gonna give you one chance to walk away and surrender. Leave with a little bit of dignity. Otherwise... it won't be pretty. I promise you. We're even. Emmett, what the fuck's going on? Viejo. Come on, motherfucker! Let it come. Fuck! -They got Ruby. We gotta go. -Where? They took her in a car. Let's go. -Is she alive? -Yeah, let's go! -Fuck. -Asshole. Do you want her dead? Calm the fuck down! They're not gonna kill her. They're taking her to Viejo. Well, let's go. We can still catch her. No, actually we can't. See what happens when you don't control your woman? Dumb bitch. Call Ruby a bitch again. Hey, Vet. Is that you? That is you. She's of no interest to me. Yeah, well, tell faggot boy I'm gonna mail her to him in pieces, okay? What do you want? You know what I want. You did good back there, no matter what I say. No, I fucked up. I let them take Ruby. Stop killing people. I'm gonna kill every motherfucker that I see. After this, I leave. -Are you listening to me? -What? Uh... no. No, not really. What do you care anyway? We're all going to hell. This is hell. I live my punishment every day. Haven't slept through the night in 20 years. Yeah, well, I sleep very well. Thank you. That's nothing to be proud of, son. But I don't believe you. You haven't crossed that line yet. I can tell by looking in your eyes. You still got your humanity. It's not too late. Oh, fuck. No, no, no! We have to save her! No! You can't go in there. God damn it! Fuck! God! Take me instead. Shut the fuck up, asshole. Put that down. Let the girl go. It's me you want. You know what I want? Bring me what I want, and I'll give you what you want. Where are you? Start walking south. I'm staying with Ruby. I have to do this. Good luck then. Be careful. Are you fucking crazy? You've got to get out of here. Stop fucking around and get out of here! -You can't help me! -I gotta... I can take care of myself! I gotta figure this out. -Junior! -Shut up! Don't you ever speak to me or interrupt me like that again. -It's just... -Ah! Don't interrupt me. You and I are getting out of here together, okay? I'm not gonna let you fucking die here. So get it through your fucking head. -Are you with me? -Aye. Are we in this together? Oui, baby. 15 minutes. If I'm not back, I want you to drive far and fast. Don't look back. Don't come back. -Can I do anything to help? -No, stay. Hey, Vet. Vet! You fucking screwball. Let it come, motherfucker. Come and get me! Throw the gun forward. Where is she? She's gone. It's just me. I told you just to... I told you just to bring her. I... She's long gone, Viejo. It's just me. Me for her. It's an even trade. I said... don't fuck with me! Now you fucked with me. Let it go, Viejo. What the fuck is it with you guys, huh? What the fuck is it with you guys? All noble and shit all of a sudden? What the fuck, man? You're going to hell. Deal with it. You ain't getting out of it now with the way you've been, especially saving the life of some fucking cheating whore. You're going to hell, because if you're going to heaven... ...so am I. They're gonna make me St. Peter in charge of the gate, fuckface. You sure you know what you're doing? Positivity, please. I'm just saying. Don't just say. Why don't you focus on your job? What's my job? Silence. Okay. Okay? Hang on, motherfucker. Come again? Oh, yeah. Special guest. What? Look at your scrawny fucking punk ass now. You have lost a step. You have. You ain't got nothing to say? You ain't talking. Hey, look. I live by a code. I live by a code, man. Ain't nobody forcing anybody to join up with this life. And if they do want to join? Amen. They know the consequences. You kill people for money. So does the government. That makes it okay? A man's gotta eat. Okay. All right. Let Ruby go. You don't need her anymore. You know, I've been thinking that too. I don't need her. You know, I don't. Fuck you. Badavich. Get your hands off her, or I'll kill you. 15 fucking years, and not even a kiss goodbye? A kiss on the cheek? Huh? A phone call? Come on, girl. A motherfucking text? You're cold. You're cold. It can't be like it was before. You tell that to Tony? You would have never let me leave. You're god damn right I wouldn't let you leave. Why would I let you leave? Till death do us part. Remember that, honey? We took vows in the eyes of the Lord. I kept mine. I was never gonna talk. I didn't care if you did. I loved you. And that's bullshit anyway. Well... You got what you wanted. No, I didn't. Don't turn this around on me. You got what you wanted. I wanted to live with you, and love you in holy matrimony, and I'm not getting it, am I? No. I'm sorry. The fuck you are. You fucking lousy-ass bitch. You're sorry for me? That's all you got for me after 15 fucking years? You and this piece of shit? That your boyfriend? Hmm? Hmm? Maybe I ought to kill him, huh? You're both professional liars. Be sorry about a fucking thing but getting caught. Don't jive with your new morality, does it? But look, you shouldn't have to be sorry because I loved you, and I love you, but I will see you in hell. Okay? Kill this bitch. I still don't know your name. It's John. Nice meeting you. Isabella. Nice meeting you, Isabella. Thanks. You're welcome.
