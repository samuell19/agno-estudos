WINTER 1941 You look very upset, my girl. Victor didn't come back last night, he stayed at Gustave's again. Gustave is a serious boy. It's not like it was before, when they're home, playing cards, they talk quietly. I hear them in the kitchen. When I come in, they go quiet, as if they have something to hide. He never used to hide things… You understand, mom? Don't worry. Let's go, Emilie. If your husband doesn't come home, he must be busy. He does what has to be done. I want to believe you. My daughter suspects something, Victor. You have to talk to her, she's your wife. For Dr. Simon. No wonder, when it's so bloody cold here! My hands are cold! I told you not to watch them… Fool! we'll get in trouble! Trouble? Trouble indeed! They can't stop me whistling can they? Has Victor gone to the factory? I don't know, I've not seen him. -Hello everyone. -Hello daddy! Hello daddy! Come on, kids, or we'll be late. Victor! My Blanche. I was scared for a moment… There's nothing to fear… See you this evening. Think of the children. I do. 1ST CLASS PHARMACY "The law on the sale of clothing and textiles was published this morning in the official journal." -Are you listening, Blanche? -Yes, Ma'am. It'll be like bread, meat and the rest of it, you'll see. "Three customer categories are to be set out." What did I tell you! More privileges for factory workers! Your husband will be better off than mine. We'll be spared nothing, it seems. -Excuse me, Ma'am. -Yes? I have butter, would you like it? What do you need? Four tubes of ointment. Is your mother's leg still bad? Yes, Ma'am. Two tubes per pound. I only have one pound. LIBERTY, EQUALITY, FRATERNITY There you go. Here, don't forget your scarf. Thank you, Marie. Has the Rouge Baiser arrived? No. I don't know when we'll get it. It's very annoying, it's the only lipstick that doesn't come off. You look after your admirers, Mrs. Charpentie! Oh Mr. Germinal, at my age! At your age? Age doesn't come into it. You are a tease, Mr. Germinal, good day. Goodbye Mrs. Charpentier, have a nice day! You too, Marie! Are you alright, Mrs. Louise? My leg is giving me trouble, Mr. Germinal. Would you like to rest a while in the back? Yes please, that will do me good. Marie! Yes dad? Come here and finish off. What's going on? Just as I was about to hand over a letter to Dr. Simon, he was arrested. Cancel the meeting at yours tomorrow. Have it at Victor's instead. I won't go. He can tell me after. Warn the others and then… you can't stay, you must leave, quickly! Leave? What do you mean? I can't leave Marie all alone! Why can't you leave me on my own, dad? What are you doing here? I came to check on Mrs. Louise, but everything seems fine. I saw nothing, heard nothing! Leave if you have to, dad. What do you mean? No need for secrecy, I know what you're up to with Mrs. Louise and co. So? It's none of your business! I totally approve. I'd love to get involved too! You know you look like a baby, right? Look at you! You're practically a child. Sorry, but you're a real airhead. I'm not an airhead! What were you up to last night, with Gustave? Doing what we have to for the country. If they catch you, they'll kill you. You don't think of us and the kids. Why do you want something to happen to me? Nothing will happen. And you'll help me. I need you. Tomorrow some friends will come over, make them a nice dinner. That's all? Yes, for tomorrow. But each morning, I'll tell you what you have to do all day, and you'll never tell a soul. What's going on, Minai? What's going on? Stay in the kitchen. She's thinking of joining us. Thinking with her little airhead. You okay, Marie? I'm fine. -Goodnight. -Goodnight. -Goodnight, mum. -Goodnight, darling, sleep well. They're lovely. When I was at my grandparents', I'd eat one every morning. Go ahead, they're fresh. Thank you. Marie! Your dad says you're an airhead, but we think you'd make a great agent. Do you know the risks, Marie? Your life, others' lives too. I don't want France to become a Kraut colony. It means no more friends, no more family, forget everything and never talk, no matter what. From tomorrow, you're on your own, your dad's leaving. He'll tell you all you need to know. Lets go back into the kitchen, come on… Thank you, gentlemen. The less you know, the better! Good evening Merlo, do you know Marie? Hello. Distribute these leaflets in the city, and you can take the girl with you. Right away. WINTER 1942 These are explosives. A comrade will pick them up in the morning. He'll have the other half. My respects to you, Ma'am. Is it real soap, mommy? Yes, from Marseille. It's me, Fernande! Soap from Marseille! It's a bit heavy… I'll try to get you some next time! No, no. Bizarre. It's not pure, is it? I know, but it's effective. So, no butter or bacon this time, I brought you some lard. I didn't find any shoes for your boy, but I have some leather! So, to go with these lovely little turnips I made a mushroom garnish. Let the peelings dry for four days, then let them soak for a good two hours in cold water, then drain them… -How long? -Two hours! Drain them, fry them in lard, serve with salt, pepper, they look just like boletus. Wait, I'll go. Hello Father! Good day to you, my child. Hello! So, I hear you're expecting! All going well, I'm due in November, Father. Oh how pretty you are, little Emilie! -You alright? -Yes. Yes! That's good. -Oh! Fernande, hello. -Father… Say, you're going to have one too, I hope? For France: Work, Family, Country. Listen here, Father, I already have four and it's not the Holy Ghost that feeds them! I'll hang up your laundry, Blanche! Come, my darling! You're getting fat faster than I am, Father! It's called patriotic portliness! If only everyone could catch that disease! Is everything okay? I saw the priest. Well, it seems the neighbor is breathing her last. It's very good, Miss. Lace, buttons, threads. Everything you need to make a charming dress. and two packs of English cigarettes, right? Exactly, Ma'am. If you have anything else like this, let me know. See you next week, Mrs. Lancelot. For your fiancé. My fiancé? Yes, your fiancé Antoine. He awaits you at the theater. With him, you are Lucie. Goodbye. EXHIBITION: THE JEW AND FRANCE LEARN TO TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN JEWS AND THE FRENCH The campaign against Man led the photographer into the very lair of Judaism, which you will now see in his particularly eloquent report. LEARN HOW TO RECOGNISE THE JEW With their domestic protests, the Jewish community has always disregarded the most elementary laws of civilizing missions. LAW ON THE STATUS OF JEWS JUNE 2, 1941 Miss! -Miss! -Lucie? No smoking in the museum. I found you! Antoine! There's a load of people at your house, Blanche. It's my family from Paris. They can't find supplies, so they come here. Antoine… Monique. -Good evening. -Good evening. It's for you. Alright kids, have you eaten? Yes mom! Here. Thank you. Antoine? Oh! English cigs! Lucie brought them. From London? Ah London! Trafalgar Square, the Thames, the fog! Oh Lucie, if only you knew England! Monique, could you hide these for me? Yes, right away. They've arrested Merlo! They came straight at him in the workshop, we couldn't do anything, he threw his tool at me, shouting: "It doesn't matter, we'll get them!" Such a nice kid. Just this morning, he told me: "Victor, I'm going to get provisions tonight, if I manage to get some meat, I'll think of you." Someone reported him, they knew who they had to arrest, they went in without asking anyone. He's just a kid, Merlo's just a kid! We have to do something, we can't just leave him, we have to get him out! I need a gun, Antoine. I'll get him out. Come on now, that's crazy talk! What can you do against all of them? I'll help him! We'll just lose two instead of one! Oh! Antoine! She's right, even two won't stand a chance. -Let's hope he doesn't talk. -Merlo? He wouldn't. -He won't give in. -Maybe. You got another hideout? -Yes. -And you? I know where to go. So we move. Good evening grandpa Léon. Marie! If I'd known I'd see you this evening… Come on in. It's been a while, something must be wrong. Is it your dad? I've had enough at home. I'm not surprised, he's just like his ma. He's always had a temper. May she rest in peace, she died in pain… I'll show you your room. You didn't bring much. Didn't you have time to pack? I closed the door and left. I see! I'm glad you're here, you bring youthfulness to the place, but… times are hard, you have to work. I'll do as you ask. You'll do the paper rounds. Open up! Search! Okay, okay, I'm coming! Light! Quickly! Well, this is nice… Quickly, quickly! Hurry up! -Victor Foucart? -That's my husband. Where is he? His aunt's place, she's sick. Where does she live? In the countryside. Who's this? My father, he fought at Verdun, he died there. You know, I have a little girl like you in Germany, What's your name? Emilie. So, Emilie, is your dad a guerilla rebel? Daddy's not a gorilla. Hurry! Hurry up now! What are you doing here? And you? The Germans started with my place. And who are these people? But… this isn't their hideout, I hope? Yes! Mother! And I was coming to reassure you. Maybe it's you who needs to be reassured now, huh? Your helper talked. Not Merlo, no way. What do you know? Were you there? Tougher guys than him talk. We'll soon find out. For now, we know squat. -He'll get what he deserves. -Enough! My children, whether he talked or not, Merlo was one of us and he doesn't deserve your anger. Keep your vengeance for the Boche. We can't go on like this. We need even more precautions. Victor! We can't hide at your place any more. Go to another region, you're done for here. There's nothing to fear, Blanche, there's nothing to fear. SUMMER 1942 Every time we went down we went to see Mother Anciot. The German wasn't far away, we could have touched him! Back then we didn't call them the Boche, it is only later that we called them that. The Germans back then weren't like they are today. We were at Mother Anciot's and I sang "A Green Mouse"; her daughter always asked me to. All of a sudden, the door opens: the future victor of Verdun had arrived! With his beady eyes he says: "Keep going til the end, Major". So I kept going until the end and then he says: "Soldiers…" Show us what you got. I'll show you what I got. Here you go! Well… Wait… look. Ooh, cigarettes. -Thank you. -Thanks very much. I'm out of ointment. So is the pharmacist. She asked me for news of Victor, as he hadn't been seen for several months, then out of the blue she says, "The Germans take hostages because of the terrorists. My husband is on the next list". Finally he'll be good for something, because he never paid much attention to the workers when he ran the town hall. Okay, your turn. Hey, Blanche, at the weekend we'll receive materials for printing flyers. Find us a place to store it. I'll see to it. You're not dressed yet? -Well, yes! -No you're not! Gustave's wife is home. She says he's always with girls. -What did you say to her? -Us? Nothing! We're the three wise monkeys: we see all, hear all, but say nothing! Has it been long since you saw your wife? Yes. A good two, three months now. Hi Alfreda, you wanted to see me? No, it's Gustave I want to see. Do you know where he is? No, I've not seen him for a while, what has become of him? Apparently he's been running after young girls. -Apparently? -Folks say so, yes! Don't play innocent, I know what our men are up to with the others. Nonsense, Alfreda. You know full well! Look, even the priest goes to your house. Go on, I won't keep you. But tell Victor I want to see Gustave and that I know he's with a girl. If he refuses, I won't put up with it. Did you see the paper? No. Two million francs. "Antwerp, tobacco shop robbed of 2000 packs of cigarettes and tobacco. Four millions francs taken." Is it four or two? No, they never had four million francs. It was shared by God, Christian charity benefits everyone fairly. You should give it to François. Wait for him at Miss Honorine Caillous' 16 rue des Carmes today at 11:30 a.m. and be on time, gifts from God don't wait. Don't blaspheme, Father. I'll be pardoned for much more! May God protect you. My little brother will be too hot, mommy, if you wrap him up like that. What will the little brother be? Huh? -Thank you. -Thank you. -Goodbye! -Bye. You're coming with us! Let me go! I haven't done anything! Bastards! Assassins! I'm French, more French than you are! Bastards! Dirty Kraut lovers! Call yourselves French? -I'm right, huh? -Maybe. Of course I am! Those collaborators betray France. Oh boy, you walk a lot! I walk across town every day, now I'm going back again. I've finished work, I'll take you. With pleasure. What's your name? Odette and you? Marthe. "German forces penetrated deeper into Stalingrad's defense system. The Marshall says, 'My government and its leader, Mr. Pierre Laval, will continue and bring the national revolution to its conclusion.'" That's it. Don't move, I'll be right back. These are cufflinks, are there any others? Huh? Are there any others? Don't damage anything, darling. Emilie, come with me. I'll play you a little tune. -Minai! -Blanche! How are you? Well? I'm fine. You're so thin. Well, yeah, I don't have Marie to cook for me anymore! Here is the mail for the Haute Butte network. Here. And you? Not too hard without Victor? No, during the day it's like he's there, I'm always cold in the evenings. When are you due? -In about two months. -Ah… Here, two million francs, Voltaire told me. Great timing. The guys at Croix de Bercy ran out four weeks ago. That's especially bad, as the Givenchy network fell last week. All the men, the hideouts… all because of agent Marceau. He fell in love, told her everything, she repeated it, obviously… There, done. He's Raoul's son. Why tell me that? You shouldn't tell me that. You're right, Blanche, I shouldn't. I'm so glad to see you. Me too. Sometimes I wonder if we'll see the end of this night. We'll see it through. I'm sure of it. He tells me that every day. There's no denying it, happiness is round, right? It's not something that goose steps. I think we'll smash them. When you win, you know, I'll be your first customer and you'll do my hair like… -Danielle Darrieux on a first date. -Yes! How is Marie? Fine. She's fine. She defends herself well. She's brave, you know? It's hard, it's hard for her, she's still a kid. Well, I can't pick her up anymore… but she's still a kid. We only see each other in the street, we don't even stop, I just give her orders, I force her to change hideouts, to learn everything by heart… It's as if I'm not her dad anymore. She's proud, strong, but… she's still my little girl. Like father, like daughter! No more touching my gun! Get out of here now, thief! I need to put some things in a safe place, do you have somewhere? What sort of thing? Printing materials. When for? Pascal will bring it. Mommy, mommy daddy's here! Daddy, daddy! He'll have the other half. Daddy's here! He must come when Henri's not in, he's working evenings all next week, I'm his wife, but he won't want that at home. He's better off not knowing anyway, and you're not to talk, under any circumstances. I got that part, ever since I saw you doing it. Hello, Blanche. Hello, Henri. Get down, kids, get down! There'll be a patrol in half an hour, get going. We'll tidy up and go home. I'll bring you your coal tomorrow, so you don't have to make the effort. Thank you. Blanche, Blanche, if you have anything in your bag, give it to me. The Germans came by earlier and said they'd be back. If they come, I'll let them in. I'm doing nothing wrong, I have nothing to be ashamed of. Go wash your hands, quick. Take care of your sisters, don't come down unless you are called. Open up! Police! Hurry up! Just a minute, I can't come to the door naked! Open up! Police! -What's going on? -Police! I'll do upstairs. Commissioner Benoit. Where is your husband? -My husband is sick. -He's sick. He's gone to say hello to his aunt! If you already know, why ask? I've heard the same song three times today! There's no need to shout, sir, I'm not deaf, and my children are asleep. Where are they? -In their room, of course! -Come on down… Quickly! Over there. In the kitchen, in the kitchen! It's fine, you can go now. There's nothing here, Commissioner! You're coming with us to tell us what you know. What I know? Yes, a little information. May I get dressed? I can't go like this. But for what we have to do you don't need to be dressed. Can I at least kiss my kids? No need, you won't see them again. Why won't I see them? I've done nothing wrong! You know the internment camps? No sir, I've never been. -Don't act tough! -I'm not! If I say I've never been, it's because I've never been. Well, you're going to die there. To grandma's, quick! Search her! Get undressed. I said, get undressed! Raise your arms. You don't think I'm hiding a gun in my armpit hair, do you? Don't give me any cheek, or I'll slap it for you. Turn around! Bend over! Spread your legs! Lower. Okay. You can get dressed. Apart from her bad seed, she's empty as a tomb! Do you know François? No, I don't know François. And Germinal Poireau. The hairdresser? Yes, the hairdresser! He's also known as François. No, his name's Germinal. Germinal is also known as François! If it makes you happy. You'll talk. Honorine Caillous, if you don't tell the truth, it will cost you dearly. Do you know this woman? If you breathe a word, you won't get out and then… even though they are police officers, they'll suspect. Did you hear that? Your friend thought he was smarter than us, so we finished him off. With a 9.5 mm just there… Germinal Poireau, you know him, right? What about François? Get rid of it, get the other one. Now then Blanche, are we going to tell the truth? What truth? I can't say I know people I've never seen, say things I've never done, or say what I've never said. So? When you've had your brat, you'll talk. You know this young man? His name is Merlo it seems, but you don't know him, you don't know anyone! Do you know this sow? It's amazing, no one knows anyone! Put your balls on the table. Put your balls on the table! Now then, Merlo, Germinal Poireau, you don't know him? Be quiet! Be quiet! Victor Foucart, also known as Floréal, still doesn't ring a bell? Be quiet! Answer! Be quiet! The Germans killed your husband. It happened in the street. They ordered him to stop, he ran away, and they killed him. Tell our friends they mustn't be angry with those who talk, they are martyrs, I assure you… Mom. Blanche Fouquart, come with me. Blanche Fouquart née Valenti, married July 16th, 1930 to Victor Fouquart. What's this, Madam? I think I'm about to give birth, sir. Mrs. Fouquart is about to give birth. Take her to hospital. Yes sir, right away. Take her to the hospital! FALL 1942 Pétain finally died last year on November 11th. He doesn't realize and his men don't dare tell him. Stop laughing and just tell me when it's over. I'll never manage it. Sure you will! It's not just the elites who have the right to speak well! You may pass, Miss. Thank you, sir. Goodbye. Sir. Off you go, Miss. Stop! Freeze! Stop! Okay, okay! Is Persephone on vacation? They've arrested Suzanne and Robert, go, go, go! Come on! That's it, surround him! Grab him! Hit him! Hit him! That's it, let's go, drive! Oh! Miss Marie. What good wind blows you here? Come in. NOTICE: MARIE POIREAU, WANTED TERRORIST REWARD: 25,000 FRANCS They're saying I'm a terrorist. 25,000 francs is a bit of an exaggeration! We'll deal with this. Everything you told Mrs. Lancelot about your activities has turned out to be true. Our group is called Milky Way. You will be called Vega, and Orion will be your contact. Mrs. Lancelot will show you your new hideout, then just forget about us. Very well. Goodbye. Miss? Vega. Orion, come in. Do you know what Vega is, Miss? A star. Yes, but what else? Well, it is the alpha of a beautiful constellation. That is, the main star of a system of several stars. I must tell you that your beauty justifies the name. It is in the shape of a V, an unfinished V, like the line that your blouse forms with your jacket. It is called the lyre, the lyre, music, poetry, island birds, enchantment… Starting from Vega, it draws an oblique line seven times the size of La Grande Barre taking you to Altaîr. I've not come to talk about stars. I've come about a job. I've come to take care of the lady. This evening? Yes, this evening, February 2nd 1943, I have to take care of areas that men are not allowed to look at. Leave us, my son. Blanche, wake up. I'm not asleep, Sister Marie-Ange, What's going on? The Russians have beaten the Germans at Stalingrad! Oh, Sister! Beaten the Germans! The Lord has blessed us with this day. We are heading for victory. Victory… I want to see it with my daughter. You will, Blanche. I don't want to go to Germany, I don't want to die. You won't be going. Keep pretending to be sick. I'll give you some boils, so they can't transport you. A male and female rabbit. Feed them well and you'll have their young. What do you want in exchange? -40 francs. -Ah no, not money. We want 40 francs. 20 francs and ointment for your granny. -Do you have some? -I've always had it. That's not what you told mom. Right, I forgot, but it's back in stock. It's not good to forget, Madam. -Hush, Emilie. -Very well. 20 francs and one tube, okay? 20 francs and two tubes! Go on then, seeing as I'm nice. How is your mom? If she ever gets out of prison. Why wouldn't she? She's done nothing wrong. Poor things! That wasn't part of the bargain. Come on Nicole, we're leaving. Goodbye, Madam. -Check the road. -Quick, I'm scared. Shut the door. Yes, yes. Come on! SUMMER 1943 Andromaque is perfumed with lavender. Pierrot looks like his grandfather. The postman fell asleep. The elephant has broken a tusk. Repeat. Jeanne is hungry. Grandpa is eating our candy. Tissien was a painter. I don't like crêpes suzettes. El Cid is playing at the opera house. Laplanders wear furs. Attali remained in ecstasy. Come. Someone's downstairs. Quick! Don't move! -Mom! -Gilbert! Mommy! Mommy! It's mommy! Nicole! And your little sister Jeanne! What's that? We thought it was a thief. And you were the police? No mom, not the police, patriots. Give me that, it's not a toy. We weren't playing, mom, We had to defend ourselves during your 13 months in prison. My children! It's late, let's put the little one to bed. In my bed, mommy. I'll get grandma. Okay. My big boy! It's good, you've not changed. Except you're alone with four kids. What will you do? I don't know. You don't have a job anymore, she won't take you back. You never know. I don't want any trouble. I want to keep going, Louis, you have to help me. No one wants someone like me. There's a cross against my name, like the door of my cell: "Terrorist"! I don't have a choice. Nobody else will do anything, we have to manage. It's Bastille Day next week, we'll reawaken patriotism in our hearts! I spotted Marie, I'll see her this afternoon. Give her this, she'll know who sent you. Okay. Alfreda. Hello Alfreda. I'm glad you came. Let me through, Blanche, let me talk to Gustave. No, not here, not now. You can't stop me from seeing him! Come to the house tonight, he'll be there. You'd better be telling the truth. He'll be there. The Germans are here, run! Run, run, they're coming! Get them! Shoot! Fire! Fire! The police came to arrest her; she threw herself out of the window. It's Mrs. Lancelot. COMMANDANT'S OFFICE Open up, it's Orion! I don't know you. Yes you do! Music, poetry, island birds. Hurry, open up! How did you find me? I followed you from Mrs. Lancelot's house. The network has fallen, there's just us left. Where did you get this? The suitcase? Put it back, you shouldn't have touched it. If you scream, the Germans will come. Marie, Blanche sent me. Blanche who? Blanche… Stay put, I'll come back later. What is it? What happened? I can't stay here, you have to take me with you. Okay, right away. Are you crazy? I might need to defend myself. You don't even know how to use it. Give it to me. Okay, quick. Let's go! Eat this, it'll do you good. You know Marie, you can't stay here, with your photo in the newspaper, it's too dangerous. Tomorrow I'll get you a hideout in town. Don't worry about Orion. I have a visitor, it won't take long, I'll be right back. Where is he? Take a seat. No thank you. Gustave is not here. He's not coming, is he? No. So why did you make me come here? I didn't want a scene this morning. No, but hang on, he's my husband, I'm the one he's cheating on with young girls. I've lost him thanks to Victor and his friends, and all your lies! Don't shout so loudly, Alfreda! People will hear us. Well I've got nothing to hide! Gustave's quite the catch with his swagger and big package, right? Maybe you're enjoying it too! Oh stop it! What nonsense! We have other stuff to do. Oh yes! You have some important stuff to do I bet! Here in Lonches! The French talk to the French. The apples are in the cellar, the cherry trees are in bloom, and my sister's hands are down the Zouave's pants! I'm sick of my Gustave sleeping with anyone he can! It's been two years since he's spent a night at home and I'm not talking about fake dates. Apparently he was being tracked by the Pétainists or the Gestapo, the cowboy! At least you never fell into poverty because of it. I'm dying from love, should I die of that too! Of course not! If he wants to bed them, I prefer to lie in silk sheets! I came into some money; I'll spend it without him, that'll teach him, I'll spend it all on myself. Too bad for him! What if he comes back? If he doesn't, I warned him, he won't get away with it. I made a list of all the people he's seen for the last two years. Victor, you, your mother, Germinal Poireau, little Merlo, Louis and the priest. It's not for nothing. I know things about him, and what Gustave told me, you wouldn't believe it! I'm giving this to the police! We have to take the body to the cemetery and put it in my father's tomb, no one will look there. It's Henri, I don't know what he's doing here. Listen, don't worry and tidy up quietly. Have you finished work? No, I got replaced. You've not gone to bed? Oh no, I was tidying up. Where are you going? Join the railroad comrades, take care of the Fridolins. No more questions. Look after yourself, my darling. Be careful. See you tomorrow. Alfreda! Alfreda! Hurry up! Be quiet! Hide! For God's sake! Get the French flag! It's not here, mommy, it's downstairs. My God, darling… Why aren't you being careful? Take care of the little ones! What's going on? The father fights, but the children pay the price. She fell down the stairs. Why was she on her own on the stairs? Here, go fill the canister. Well, I was hanging flags at the window. Wow, it doesn't take much for you to forget your kids. The resistance is over, now it's war. So stop all that and take care of the kids. I don't want to see your face outside until it's over. Come on, kids, let's go upstairs. Fernande, come quick! We're to go to the town hall to welcome the English, they're arriving. What happened, did she fall? Where's your smile? Come quick, we've got a car! Hey, it's alright. Where we going? Town hall, to see the English. What, is it Henri? Hey? Come on, don't stay here on a day like today! Blanche, come get your picture taken with us! Gustave! Come on. -Do you know Fernande? -No. Yes you do, Fernande Arnold… It was at her place that we printed all the leaflets since November '42. And her husband never knew about it. Arnold, but your husband is Henri from the Amédé group. Closer together! -And he never knew? -No! That's incredible! Stand closer together. What did he say when he found out? It was like the Germans were at the door again! He will never forgive me, he's not the only hero in the family! He entered the game much later than me, in July '43! Okay, nobody move! It's an ambulance! Cease fire! -Let it through! -The Boche! He's crazy, he'll be killed! No, the Boche won't shoot straight today. Stand back, they'll get you! No Miss, they're leaving, you will be able to cross. Victory is ours! Ah the bastards! The bastards! The bastards! -Oh the bastards! -He's dead. The idiot didn't steal it. Dirty collaborator! Don't touch my little girl! You, pretending you're Gavroche under fire, enough standing around! I'll take you home and lock you up. Watch out, there's a sniper! Marie! Run! Marie! …taking what is not yours to take compromises the survival of others. Looters starve others. Since your husband was the first to be killed by the Boche, you get to avenge him. But he's almost dead. They killed your husband, you have the right to avenge him. A prisoner… a child… No, never! The English are behind us! On their way! They're behind us! The English are coming! We saw them on the road! We are free! We are liberated! We're free! Free! Marie! My sweet Marie! Victory! The Americans are coming! Marie! Oh Marie! In the town… Let her speak! -All those who were hungry… -Come on, Marie… The ones who were always queueing now they're drunk, shouting out loud: "Hang the Krauts from street lamps!" Everywhere, folks are happy even if they haven't done anything! No more! We've won. Ooh, you've become so hard, haven't you? The English are here! We're free! Long live the Americans! -Long live the pharmacist! -To the pharmacist! -Long live the pharmacist! -It's the pharmacist! Victory! Victory! We're fr… Fernande, come with us. Come on, mom! We're free! Long live Fernande! Victory! Victory! Victory! What gives you the right to wear that armband? That's Orion. Here, Marie! We're going home, my mother's tired. I am very moved, by the honor bestowed upon me today, to be able to tell you, after all these painful years, I am proud to see my country is free, thanks to the resistance work that we all took part in! I myself have been… I myself have been… I myself… -Victor. -My Blanche. For a moment I was scared… There's nothing to fear. If they catch you, they'll kill you. You don't think of us and the kids. Yes, I do. Why do you want something to happen to me? Nothing will happen. See you tonight. THE END Subtitle translation by: Emma Sayers
