(Inspired by true events) INNER COURT Good morning. - Good morning. - Mornin' - How was the night? - Slow. Good morning. I said good morning. Good morning. See ya. Take care Giba. - Good rest. - Good luck. Good morning. - Is that Clara? - Don't touch the photo! Stay here with him. The hallway camera is down! Take him to his chambers. I wouldn't do that. Clara? Is everything okay with the kids? No. Is everything alright there? Did someone try and speak to you? No? Okay then. No, no. Everything's fine. Let me speak with the agent there with you... Hi Carlos, it's Giba. Did you notice anything strange over there? Someone left a photo of the family here. The photo looks recent. No, just the photo. Did the signal come back? Hold on a second. No. It's back! It's down again. It's working! Hey boss. We're gonna have to relocate the family, again. Of course. One more at the door and... more agents in the vicinity. Good morning ma'am. Excuse me, but I have to take a look inside that bag. Good morning your honor. Something happen? They found the kids and Clara. In Buenos Aires? They left a photo under the door. In here? How? I don't know. Did you call tech support about my computer? I call them every day. Is everything okay with Clara and the kids? I think so. Today's cases and this afternoon's witness list. What time's the caretaker's hearing? Marco de Oliveira's the first, at 1 pm. The others in order are: Jose Maria Brasil, Romulo Alcantara... Forget the rest. They get a big payday from the ex-senator to do hard time, while he shows up in the 'rich and famous' column of the paper. What if the caretaker doesn't talk? We know what happens. Or what doesn't happen. Hopefully you can finally get out of here. How was your evening? You've been in here almost a month now, Gustavo. How was it? I'll be out there if you need me. Are you okay? I don't know. Don't know. Call the doctor please. Thank you. The doctor's here. Something happen? Just a precaution. I'm fine. You can put your shirt back on. Everything seems normal. I didn't find any significant alterations. But it would be wise to see a cardiologist... for a more thorough examination. Everything you're feeling surely is an indication that something's happening... and should be monitored closely. What do you mean? Would you agree that we've had a unusual day? And you don't seem well. What do you mean? I don't think today is a good day for you to preside court. I'm sorry, what? - It is very important that you are not... - in contact with any strangers today. I'd like to request the cancellation... Mr. Donato. Hello your honor. Finally confirmed the caretakers testimony? Mr. District Attorney, as I was saying to Mr. Ferreira, we have an issue to discuss. What issue? We've had some unusual occurrences here today... and I'm advising him against presiding the hearings. Your honor, I don't what happened here today... but it would be terrible to simply cancel all the witnesses. You know very well that without the caretaker's testimony... we don't have the slightest chance to convict the ex-Senator. Your honor my advice is to cancel all courtroom activities. I will not cancel court. Thank you your honor. Excuse me. I know you're worried about me... but we are going to proceed as planned. Can't you at least cancel the other witnesses? If the photo was planted inside here despite all our security... there must me someone on the inside. The longer you are exposed in the courtroom... the greater the chance that something might happen. I'm gonna cancel the other witnesses. Thank you. Better eat while its warm. I'm going to the bathroom. Please stay here. Are you okay in there? Yes. Fontes? Your honor? Your honor. Mr. Ferreira. Didn't touch your food? Could you please wear the vest? Good afternoon Mr. Aristoteles. - Mr. Donato good afternoon. - Good Afternoon your honor. Good Afternoon. Verinha, do me a favor... cancel all the witnesses for today except the first one. May I ask why your honor? Security reasons. Today we will be hearing the witness Marcos de Oliveira. The caretaker. We are waiting his arrival. How's the family your honor? Wonderful. Thanks for asking. - Cancelled your honor. - Thank you. The witness has not arrived at the courthouse. Well, it seems I don't have a choice. We will reschedule the witness's hearing. Any objection from the district attorney or the defense? No your honor. None. The hearing will be rescheduled, and the witness will be subpoenaed to appear on a new date. Verinha, check and see if the other witnesses are still in the courthouse. We're gonna do the others? If they're still in the courthouse. Excuse me. Didn't we agree to cancel the other witnesses? I'm gonna put them on the stand if they are still in the courthouse. I can't lose the entire day! Every minute in that courtroom is an unnecessary risk! Yes. Which one? The bus driver. Send him up. Name please. Romulo Soares Alcantara. Identification number. One, two, six, eight, seven, four. Profession? Bus driver. Do you swear to tell the truth, so help you God? Yes. Mr. Romulo Soares Alcantara Neto, correct? Please respond clearly yes or no... because we are recording audio and video. Yes sir. First of all good afternoon. Thank you for being here. I'm going to allow the district attorney... to ask you some questions. Yes. Thanks your honor. Good afternoon Romulo. On November 7th last... a commercial bus of the Rodram company, that you were driving... was apprehended with a total of 104 kilos of cocaine paste... hidden in two large suitcases. Whose suitcases were they? I'm going to rephrase my question. Who owns the company that you work for? You don't want to answer? Let me remind you that if you don't want to talk about the suitcases... you alone will be charged with intent to distribute 104 kilos… I'm sorry, but this hearing is cancelled. - Yo. - What's up? - Nailed the rat. - Really? - What about the man in black? - He's holed up in that fortress of his... - Won't leave that courthouse for nothing. - Tell the boss we gonna get him too... only a matter of time. We just found the caretaker's body. I just found out about the caretaker. Let's leak everything we have on the ex-Senator to the media. The phone taps. Illegal offshore accounts. - That's against the law your honor. - You're well aware of this. Leak everything. I'm very sorry about what happened today. Excuse me. No tech support? Tech support didn't come. What do you mean? I didn't authorize anyone to come in here today. But it's just tech support! Unfortunately, he won't come in today. You can't be serious! Want me to take a look? Fontes. Fontes! We need to talk about my security. Yes. I lost the entire day because of this. It's one problem after another! We had an unusual day. - Unusual day! - Fuck your unusual day! Every day is gonna be an unusual day? Every day now you're gonna want to cancel my trials? This situation is crap! Soon you'll go home to screw your wife, Go out to dinner. Go shopping, whatever. And I'm the one stuck in this shithole 24 hours a day. With no privacy. Not a fucking thing! Why don't you guys just throw me in a fucking jail cell! You guys are fucking me over! Fucking me! I shouldn't have cancelled shit today! Does the police really know what's going on here?! Where's the fucking 'intel' Fontes? Where? Can the police explain to me what the fuck is happening here? Can someone explain to me what is happening here? Your honor? Gustavo. Gustavo? Do you want me to stay here with you? Thank you, Bia. It's not necessary. See you tomorrow. Today, Gustavo Ferreira, the judge in charge of the trial of former senator Ronaldo Riachuelo... released a telephone wire between two men belonging to criminal organizations, I'm leaving, okay? Fabio's here. Where's Jura? Not sure. Fabio called him, but he didn't answer. Shows that he was in fact the owner of more than 100 kilos of cocaine paste... Do you want me to call headquarters? Seized in two suitcases insided... - No. - I'll see what I'm gonna do. See you tomorrow then. Riachuelo has three different offshore accounts Good night, your honor. Good night, Giba. With more than 90 million dollars, the result of... the result of supposed illegal commissions in multi billion contracts with contractors made... by the government during his term as senator. The former senator declined to comment on the leak or the existence of off-shore accounts. Olavo Aristoteles, his lawyer, issued a note in which he sees an 'affront' to the legal rights... of Riachuelo and that the leak of the telephone wire is unethical and illegal. The police also confirmed earlier today the death of key witness Marcos de Oliveira... Riachuelo's caretaker, after he didn't show up to court this afternoon. His death jeopardizes the prosecution's entire strategy, losing it's only witness willing... to testify against the former senator. And Brazil's financial woes won't go away... - Hi… - Hey. - Hey there. - Hey. They're not in there. Is everything alright? We're fine. Good night. Good night.
