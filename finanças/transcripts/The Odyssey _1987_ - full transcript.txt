(dark brooding music) (dramatic music) (soft ethereal harp music with chorals) - [Narrator] Long, long ago before the mighty gods left man to his destiny, the world was full of adventurers. The greatest of these was Odysseus. Never before or since has a mortal combined such bravery and cleverness. At times, he even outwitted the immortal gods. (dark brooding music) (doors creak open) (Zeus laughs) - I've had just about all I can take from those mortals. Why don't we just get rid of them all and be done with it? - We need mortals as much as they need gods, Poseidon. Tell me, Athena. How goes your favorite among mortals? The most admirable Odysseus? - Ha! Yes, Athena. Tell us what new mischief that troublesome mortal has gotten himself into. - Great Zeus, Odysseus has traveled far from his native isle of Ithaca. (water splashes) (dramatic music) For the past nine years, he has fought with great courage at the siege of the city of Troy. Odysseus fearlessly led his men into Troy, little knowing he would remain for nearly 10 years. (feet thud) Many where the captains of the Greek armies, but there was none more cunning, more resourceful, more skilled than noble Odysseus. Many brave men, Greek and Trojan, died in the fierce battles. (men yell) (swords clang) Odysseus survived and commanded the final desperate attempt to breach the city's impregnable walls. (wind howls) It is said the cunning notion of the wooden horse sprang from Odysseus's fertile mind. (feet thud) (soft dramatic music) (crickets chirp) - Open the gates! (gates creak open) (footsteps shuffle) (footsteps shuffle) (dramatic music) (wheels click) (gates creak shut) (men yell) (crickets chirp) (soft tense music) (door creaks open) (feet thud) (wood thuds) (gates creak open) (dramatic music) - He is truly a most unique mortal. I do believe that one day, Odysseus will outsmart one of us. - Ba! No mortal could deceive a god, never. - And what is his destination now Athena? - He travels to his island home Ithaca, great Zeus. Let us watch him awhile. (water splashes) - Captain Odysseus, we must reach land soon. Our food is low and the water jar's nearly empty. - Praise be to the gods on Olympus. - [Eurylochus] Land! Ithaca? - No, Eurylochus, it is not home, but it is land. We will take on food and water. (waves lap) (gulls caw) I will take six men inland. We'll carry skins of fine wine to offer to whomever can give us assistance. Eurylochus, you stay and guard the ship. (bugs chitter) (footsteps shuffle) - A cave! (tense music) - [Odysseus] This way, men! - Forgive me, Odysseus, but I am greatly greatly afraid. The occupant of this cave must be a giant! (large footsteps thud) - Quiet, men. What is that? (dramatic music) (boulder rumbles) Hide yourselves quickly! (feet stomp) - What man dares invade the home of a cyclops? Show yourself! - We are sailors, sir, stranded on your shore. - So like thieves, you sneak into my home. - We are not thieves, sir. We only seek nourishment, and Zeus himself has decreed that poor wanderers like ourselves should receive hospitality. - Ha ha ha! Zeus, Zeus. What do I care for Zeus? I only fear one god, my father Poseidon, and he cares little for thieving strangers. You poor wanderers may be - No! - of some use after all. - Please, let me go! - I haven't had meat for many a months. (chair clatters) (dramatic music) (man screams) - [Man] Stop! - Stop! You incur the wrath of the gods! - You are welcome to stay in my humble cave. You are guests of the cyclops! (laughs) - Odysseus, what will we do? - Fear not. I have a plan. (flames crackle) (boulder rumbles) (sheep bleat) (hooves shuffle) - It's cold tonight, so I brought my little friends with me. Your companions were delicious. (dramatic music) (laughs) - Give me the wine. Cyclops, as you intend to devour us all, there is no point in trying to hide our special vintage wine. - Wine? Wine. You have wine? Then give it to me! (feet stomp) (gulps) (sighs) This is nectar, nectar and ambrosia distilled. You have more? - Quickly, more wine. (feet stomp) (gulps) (moans) What is your name, little man? - Odysseus. - Well, as reward for giving me this fine wine, I will eat Odysseus last! (laughs) More! (feet stomp) (tense music) (flames crackle) Wine, good. Sleepy. (body thuds) (cyclops groans) - Quickly, you two, fetch the beast's staff. (tense music) Come in. (sword hacks at staff) (sword sheathes) (footsteps shuffle) (twig snaps) Help me but quietly, quietly. If he had two eyes, my plan would not succeed, but like this, we might have a chance. Come on, men! (dramatic music) (cyclops cries out) - My eye! I'm blind! You'll pay for this, Odysseus! (cyclops growls) (objects clatter) (cyclops breathes raggedly) (boulder rumbles) You can't escape me, Odysseus. I'll let my sheep out to graze, and then I will search every corner of this cave until I find you and your tasty friends! There you go, my beauties. (sheep bleat) (hooves clop) One, two, three, and four. Here's my favorite, a brave ram. Shall I take all your belly as I always do? No, I think not. I have work to do. (hooves shuffle) (boulder rumbles) (sheep bleat) There's no point in hiding. Odysseus, you're finished! - Quickly, to the ship! (dramatic music) (feet stomp) - You tricked me! Curse you! Listen (muffled speaking) Poseidon, destroy the men that blinded your son! (dramatic music) (waves crash) (cyclops groans) (boulder splashes in ocean) - Ha ha! (soft ethereal choral music) - I must finish this Odysseus. He has blinded Polyphemus, my own son. - The beast deserved more, the way he insulted Zeus, mighty lord of the winds. - The cyclops did insult me, but a son's blindness must be avenged. You must not kill Odysseus, but you may fill his homeward journey with peril and evil plight. Zeus has spoken. (Poseidon blows) (wind howls) (tense music) - [Man] Land ho! - Ithaca. - Home, home! Praise be. Ithaca, men. We've We've made it. (men cheer) (thunder rumbles) Odysseus, what's happening? - Drop the sail and hang on! (thunder crashes) (waves crash) (mast cracks) (thunder crashes) Have you ever seen a place such as this, Eurylochus? - [Eurylochus] No, and I wish I were not seeing it now. 'Tis a fit home for neither man nor beast. We've run aground! Where are we? - [Odysseus] I have heard of a place like this. The island of Aeaea, home of the witch, Circe. - [Eurylochus] Well, it certainly isn't Ithaca. - Hmm, a beautiful but formidable goddess full of trickery. We must take great care. I will split the men into two groups. You command one and start repairs on the ship. I will go ashore and beseech Circe to help us. - Let me go, Odysseus. I have a way with women, even witches. - Very well. Eurylochus, you may take your men and call on Circe. See if she'll give us supplies to rebuild the ship. - So be it. (bugs and birds chitter) (footsteps shuffle) (monkey howls) (brush rustles) (soft tense mysterious music) - Welcome. Welcome to my home. I have fine wines and good food. Please join me. - An offer I cannot refuse. - She's beautiful. - No, men, wait! It's a trap! (footsteps shuffle) - To the gods! - [Men] The gods! (men cry out and gag) (bodies thud) (Circe cackles) (men oink) (dramatic music) - Pigs? - Head of pigs, bodies of men. What can we do? - The goddess Athena will help us. (dramatic music) (men oink and snort) - Oh, help us, great goddess Athena! (rumble echoes) Athena. - Stand up, brave Odysseus. Here, swallow these herbs before you visit the witch. Her magic will not affect you. Farewell! (rumbles echoes) (dramatic music) (footsteps shuffle) - Welcome to my house, brave warrior. Come, share a drink with me. - I can think of no greater pleasure. (glasses clink) (Odysseus sighs) Delicious. - What is this? What sort of man are you? Nobody can resist the power of Circe's magic. - Without help from the gods. - (gasps) What do you want? Name it, and it is yours. - Release my men from your spell and help me get away from this place. - You have my word. What is your name, brave warrior? - Odysseus. (men oink and snort) - Oh, pity. (light undulates and blasts) (tense brooding music) (dramatic music) (sail rustles) (muffled chatter) - You have been true to your word, Circe. Many thanks. - You are the bravest warrior I have ever met, Odysseus. The gods favor you. I will help you find a way back to your beloved Ithaca. - Thank you, kind Circe. - Odysseus, you must first make a perilous journey. - Where must I venture, Circe? - A powerful god opposes you. To avoid him, you must travel to the very holes of Hades and there consult with the blind prophet Tiresias. He will tell you how to reach your home. - Tiresias? What does he look like? How will I find him? - This map will show you how to get to Hades. No living man has been there before. As for Tiresias, he is dead already. He will find you. Farewell, Odysseus. (tense music) - The map to Ithaca? - I'm afraid not. We have to go somewhere else first. - Whereabout, Odysseus? Egypt, Crete? - Oh, Eurylochus, we are going to Hades itself. - Hades? But don't you have to be dead first? - I hope not, Eurylochus, but we shall see. (dramatic music) (birds caw) (monster growls) (vulture caws) (water splashes) (birds caw) (rocks clatter) (footsteps shuffle) (rocks crumble) - What do you want here? - Yeah, what do you want? - I am Odysseus. I seek the blind prophet Tiresias. - (growls) Go back. Only that dead are welcome here. - (muffled speaking) Be gone! - Can a living man pass through the portals of Hades? - No! He is surely doomed to die. - Doomed, do you hear? (dramatic music) - Then let me pass as I am doomed and therefore dead already. (creature growls) (dark brooding music) (creature growls) (dark dramatic music) It looks like blood. Throw a pebble into the Red Lake. When the ripples reach the other sides, Tiresias will appear before you. (pebble plops into lake) (soft tense mysterious music) (dramatic music) - Odysseus, you seek instructions to guide you back to your homeland. - Yes! How did you know? - Silence. I am Tiresias the prophet. I know what you want. Listen well, Odysseus, or your journey will fail. The first danger you will face is the sirens. No man can resist their beautiful voices and live. Next, you will face- - What was that? (earth rumbles) (bats squeak) - Poseidon the earth shaper. It is he who torments you, and now he is angry with me for helping you. I must hurry. After the sirens, you must face the six-headed monster, Scylla, and the mighty whirlpool, Charybdis. Do not attempt to fight Scylla. She will devour six of your crew. There is nothing you can do. - Six of my men? But I- (boulder crumble) - I must be quick. Charybdis sucks down the sea three times each day. Time your passage carefully, and you will be safe. Poseidon is very angry. If you survive Scylla and Charybdis, you went past the Island of the Sun. Do not touch the beautiful sheep and cattle that graze there. They belong to Zeus. If you harm them, you will die. (wind roars) (earth crumbles) Leave this place! Go! Go! (boulder thunders) (boulders thunder) (explosions boom) (creature growls) (Odysseus cries out) (dramatic suspenseful music) (feet thud) (creature growls) (slow dramatic music) (birds caw) (footsteps shuffle) (muffled chatter) - Quick, men! Away from this cursed place! (sail drops) (dramatic music) Take this wax and block on years, men! Your lives depend on it! (tense music) Now tie me to the mast as firm as you can. (footsteps shuffle) I must hear the voices of the sirens. - You will die, Odysseus. - Do as I say, Eurylochus! Bind me to the mast, and if I beg you to free me, bind me tighter. - I will obey, captain. (footsteps shuffle) (ship groans) (water laps) (tense brooding music) (seagulls caw) (water laps) (water splashes) Sirens! (eerie discordant harp music) ♪ Beautiful Odysseus (muffled singing) ♪ Bring your ship to rest ♪ Stay with us ♪ So you may listen to our voices ♪ (muffled singing) ♪ Odysseus ♪ Odysseus ♪ Odysseus ♪ Odysseus - Eurylochus, release me! I order you! Do as I say, Eurylochus! I beg you to free me! Eurylochus! (eerie discordant music) Release me! I order you! I beg you, Eurylochus! Do as I say, Eurylochus! ♪ Odysseus ♪ Odysseus (waves lap) (footsteps shuffle) - Thank you, Eurylochus. Well done. We have passed the sirens safely. We now face a double peril. On one side, Charybdis, the mighty whirlpool that suck ships to their doom, and on the other, the demon Scylla. - Is there no other passage, Odysseus? We have all been through much already. - [Man] Eurylochus is right, Captain Odysseus. - Let's find another way round. - Silence! I spoke to the prophet Tiresias, and I tell you what he told me! If we want to see our beloved Ithaca again, we must go this way. To the oars, men! If we have fast, we can avoid the whirlpool. The other creature, I do not know. (dramatic suspenseful music) - Speed, men! Speed will save us! (whirlpool roars) - Pull, men! Pull! We're nearly through! - Well done, crew! An excellent piece of rowing. - Ha! No whirlpool will ever claim this ship. Your prophet was wrong, captain. There was no other creature. We're through one on our way to Ithaca. (men cheer) - [Tiresias] Next you will face Scylla, the six-headed monster. She will devour six of your crew. Do not attempt to fight Scylla. There is nothing you can do. (Scylla growls) (tense dramatic music) (stones splash) (men laugh) (Scylla screeches) (dramatic suspenseful music) (man screams) - Help! (screams) (men scream) (Scylla screeches) - [Man] Help us! - [Man] Odysseus, help us! (Scylla screeches) - [Tiresias] There is nothing you can do, nothing. (dark brooding music) - The whirlpool! (dramatic music) Eurylochus, quickly! Row, men! Row for your lives! (muffled shouting) Hang on! (water splashes) (dramatic music) (bird caws) (ship creaks) (tense brooding music) That is the Island of the Sun. Tiresias has told me of peril there, far greater than we have faced already. - What is it, Captain Odysseus? - Tell us if this new creature. - Peril is within us. The creatures are mere sheep and cattle, harmless in themselves, but they're pets of the great god Zeus. Woe to anyone who should harm these creatures. My instincts tell me we should keep on sailing and avoid the Island of the Sun. - Keep on sailing? I'm exhausted! - No, I can't go on. - Captain Odysseus, our drinking water was lost in the fight against the vortex, so we must stop soon. Our food supply is plentiful. Zeus's sheep and cows are safe. - Eurylochus is right. We should stop! - We will not harm the animals. - They have nothing to fear from us. - Very well. We land. But remember, no harm must befall the sheep and cattle, or we surely doomed. (men cheer) - A wise decision, captain. (tense brooding music) (birds caw) (soft tense music) (birds chirp) (water rushes) You have nothing to worry about, little friend. We won't harm you. (sheep bleat) (game pieces tap) (man laughs) (water splashes) (soft dramatic music) - Let's see how safe Zeus's pets are when there are hungry men about. (Poseidon blows) (wind roars) (fire crackles) - This cursed north wind has blown for 10 days. - And while it blows, we cannot leave. We wait, Eurylochus. We wait. - But Odysseus, we have no food! Unless the men eat soon, they will starve. - I will go alone to the top of that hill and pray to the gods. Perhaps they will abate the north wind. (tense music) - I am starving. - I must eat soon. - I'm so hungry, I could eat a Trojan! - Men, we need not starve. We are surrounded by food. (sheep bleat) - Surely Zeus wouldn't miss just one. - Or two. - Stop! Do not even think of such a thing. Odysseus is praying to the gods for help. - The gods. What good have the gods done us so far? - We have been forsaken by the gods! (tense music) (sheep bleat) - You are right. I will do the deed. (tense dramatic music) (footsteps shuffle) (wind roars) - Zeus, great father of all mankind, I beseech you to rest the great north wind. My men and I have been through much... (sniffs) No! Zeus's sheep and cattle! (tense brooding music) (footsteps shuffle) (fire crackles) (meat sizzles) I would rather go hungry. - What Zeus doesn't know, Zeus won't worry about. - Zeus knows everything! (soft ethereal choral music) - And then they cooked them and ate them all. - My cattle and sheep, Zeus's own animals. - Did Odysseus eat the sacred meat? - No. Surprisingly, their captain showed more sense. - Any who harmed my animals will die. (water laps) (dark brooding music) - It has been a week now, captain. The sky is clear. The wind is fair. We are safe. - I fear not, Eurylochus. (tense music) (birds chirp) (water laps) (discordant mysterious music) - What does it mean? (dark brooding music) (bleats echo) - Do you hear that? We're doomed! - Nah, it's just the wind in the rigging. (thunder crashes) (flames roar) (man screams) (mast topples) (men scream) (mast topples) (thunder crashes) (Eurylochus screams) (thunder crashes rapidly) - [Eurylochus] Help! (ship topples) (men scream) (thunder crashes) - Jump or you'll go down and die! (mast topples) (fire roars) - [Man] Odysseus, help us! (fire roars) (water bubbles) (water splashes) (water splashes) - [Athena] I will save you. Cling to me, Odysseus. - [Odysseus] Help me, Athena! Help me! (cries out) (tense music) (flames crackle) - No, no, please! Let me go! (muffled shouting) (Polyphemus screams) (thunder crashes rapidly) (birds screech) (monkey howls) (pigs oink) (thunder crashes) (vultures caw) (earth rumbles) (bats skitter) (creature growls) ♪ Odysseus (whirlpool roars) (Scylla screeches) (men scream) (water laps) (waves crash) (birds chirp) (brush rustles) (body thuds) (syrinx softly whistles) - How gracefully the princess Penelope dances. - Thank you, Iris. That is most kind. - (laughs) But how much prettier she would dance with a fine strong husband. - That is not for a maid to say. I have told you, Iris. When I see the man for me, I will know. (footsteps shuffle) (Penelope gasps) - Eek! A wild man! - I will protect you, princess. - Fear not, maiden. I will not hurt you. I have a traveler who has undergone much hardship. - Your condition tells me that. We must assist this traveler. There is nothing to worry about. He is obviously of noble birth. Come, sir. I will take you to my father, King Alcinous. (birds chirp) (soft pleasant music) (goblet clinks) - Sir, you are welcome in our house. Eat and drink your fill. You are among friends here. - Thank you, King Alcinous and Queen Arete. May the gods look upon you with kindness. - Please, sir. We're most curious. Be so kind as to tell us your name and what brings you to our fair island. (soft lyre music) (birds chirp) - I am Odysseus, royal son of Laertes, sacker of cities, and wanderer of the world. - Oh! - Odysseus himself? - We are honored, Odysseus. Come up here and sit with us. Please, tell us if you wish of your adventures since the fall of Troy. - Yes, Odysseus. Please tell us. (footsteps shuffle) - It is a long and tragic tale but I hope an interesting one. After leaving the great plain of Troy in my fine ship, I set out for my home, Ithaca. And so I met the most beautiful Penelope. - A remarkable journey, Odysseus, remarkable. - Fear not, Odysseus. A Phaeacian ship will return you to your Ithacan home on the next tide. - Thank you, Queen Arete. (trumpet blares) (footsteps shuffle) - Yes, yes, what is it? - From the high priest, your majesty. The god Poseidon has given him the name of our next sacrifice. - Poseidon? - We are a seafaring nation. So to ensure a safe passage for our ships, once a year, we sacrifice one of our young women to the god of the sea. - Poseidon selects the chosen one, and the one who is picked must go. Oh no. - What is it? Who is the sacrifice? - Our daughter, Penelope. (dramatic music) (Penelope gasps) - I will not let this happen. (birds chirp) (soft tense music) (rumble echoes) Athena! What can I do? - The sacrifice will take place at a small cove on the other shore of Phaeacia. Princess Penelope will be tied to a stake, and Poseidon will emerge from the sea to carry her back down to his watery kingdom. - Then all is lost. - Not so, Odysseus. Poseidon must reduce his size to that of a mortal to enter the cove. He is vulnerable at this point. If you cling to him, he will grant your wishes. - I will do it then. - Beware. He may change his shape into many different forms. (rumble echoes) (bird caws) (waves crash) (somber music) (water splashes) (dark brooding music) - Fear not, maiden. You will enjoy life under the waves eventually. (laughs) Huh? - Odysseus! (men grunt) - Odysseus! You tricked me! (men grunt) (water splashes and bubbles) (lion roars) (dramatic suspenseful music) (Odysseus cries out) (snake hisses) (Odysseus cries out) (boar growls) (lizard hisses) (water splashes) (shark roars) (Odysseus cries out) (Poseidon groans) What do you want? - You must exact no more sacrifices from the Phaeacians. - Yes. - And you must leave me in peace. I have paid in full for blinding your son. - Yes, yes, you have my word. - [Odysseus] Go, then. - Thank you, Odysseus. Thank you for saving my life. Untie me quickly. - Not until you answer one question. - What? What question? - Penelope, will you come to Ithaca with me as my wife? - Yes, Odysseus! Oh, yes! (muffled chatter) (bright swelling music) - Farewell, Penelope. Return to us with our grandchildren. - A safe passage to Ithaca. - Goodbye. - Farewell, and thank you. - And so they married and sailed to fair Ithaca to live in peace. - Live in peace? No. Odysseus will have many more adventures yet, of that I am sure. I thought you said no mortal could ever deceive a god. - No mortal except Odysseus.
