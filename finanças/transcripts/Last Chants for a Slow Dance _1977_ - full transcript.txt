Take whatever. We're on the road again. Are you recording? Do you want me to now, start? Am I supposed to start now? You said 30 seconds, I didn't hear anything from then. Ok. No, I never did think about where I was going. I can hardly remember where i've been. Shit, it's like.... life's too complicated, you know? I mean, don't you ever get the feeling that everything's just going by woosh! Just going by, it's all too fast. Can't, can't, see anything it's just going by. It's too complicated you know? I guess what I got to do is sort through some of this shit. Get some of this shit out of my life... then, then i'll know where i've been. I don't know. The deal is I can't remember anything from where i've been. The past, I don't remember anything. A couple of things maybe, things that hurt, when i got hurt. I remember being whipped when I was a kid. I remember that real good. and I remember running away, I remember running away. All the time I was always running away... didn't matter where, I would just run away all the time. I've always been that way I guess, like... too much, too much inside my head, you know... and some of it I just had to get out, you know... just go off and drive and drink beers and... get laid, you know. At first it upset Darlene, that's my wife Darlene. She'd get all upset and cry, oh hell... I never could explain to her it had nothing to do with her it... nothing to do with her really at all, I just had to get away, I had to get out, you know. She'd get upset, she threw things at me, I mean... anthing she could get her hands on, knives, dishes... she threw a pot of coffee at me once, burnt my whole arm. God that hurt. I smelled like coffee. Upset yeah... she was pregnant see with our first kid, Bobbie. I never wanted any kids, I never did, I never wanted any kids. And I got two of them, two of them. For not wanting any, that's a whole lot. One thing just leads to another, know what I mean. It does, I wish it could work that way with jobs. See i've been driving all over this state for 2 fucking months... and I can'r find nothing, nothing, there is no work. It's not like I don't want a job either, i'd do anything, I take a job. Christ i'm sure... i'm desperate. I'm desperate. That's not true, that's not true. Of course Darlene is on my back, fucking bitch! "Why don't you get a job Tom? Can't sit all your life Tom." God damn woman, I love her and all that but... Jesus Christ, you could put shit in my face, you know. It's not even like she was starved either. I put money in the bank, I put... I put $2,000 in the bank. She's got money. Shit... well it's gone, sure. Hell, you can't get ahead, small man can't get ahead. I don't care what you do. There's no way you're ever going to get ahead. Shit. What i'm gonna do... What i'm gonna do is get some of this shit out of my life, just get it out, just get it out of my life. I'm gonna make things simple... i'm gonna make things a hell of a lot more simple, and then, I get to a place where I can start over, that's what i'm gonna do, i'm gonna start over. You can't man, you can't do it, it don't work that way. "I just received sweetheart, your yellow roses" I wonder what she's doing now... Darlene. It's 1, 1.15, she's putting she kids to nap... she's watching tv, watching the television, all the time. "You tell me that it means that we are through, you tell me that"... oh god. I knew this girl in Butte... her name was Dee, prettiest girl, oh my god beautiful girl, she had... had red hair and... god damn truckers all over this god damn road... big motherfuckers think they can do any god damn thing they want. Harass the shit out of me, arsehole. She had red hair see, she had beautiful curls, red hair and green eyes, and her skin was real pale, we were gonna run away together, she and me. Darlene was pregnant again, our second kid. Two remember? Two. Billy. Women. Women I will never understand them, will you? It's a real problem. Yeah, it's a problem. Shouldn't have had a lot of them, I shouldn't. I still do. I have a lot of women in my life, all the time, any time I want. Any time I want, there are women, still, right now.

Yeah, funny, what about it? I'm just saying a lot of people will be in trouble... if they don't get some rain. Big deal, so what's that got to do with me? I don't see that shit, I don't load that shit. There's nothing there. There is nothing out there. You'd have to be blind not to notice that. -Huh? I said you'd have to be blind not to notice that. Well maybe, maybe I was looking of something else, you ever think of that? I mean, you ever give that a thought? I was looking of something else, ok? Fucking funnies. I didn't mean to get you uptight. Alright, you didn't mean to get me uptight. Well you did... you succeeding in getting me uptight. Are you happy now?

Hair's lighter. The sun. Yeah, it's pretty. Getting lots of sun? Some. Guess you wouldn't know though, would you? This time, not a word. You know if... if you don't care much about me, you could at least think of the kids. I mean, what about the kids? No money, no word. What about clothes, food? All that shit, huh? Or just being here, what about that huh? Hey I just got back alright? Hey come on. Alright. Ok I know I acted like a shit alright, I... Shit. I should've got some money. You call splitting like that being a shit? You feel like it so, whatever Tom wants, Tom gets huh? I get stuck here. How long this time? 5 weeks, 6 weeks. And the time before, and before that? How many times Tom? I don't know. You know, I wanted to come back here because I wanted to feel good. I don't want to feel bad anymore, I want to feel good. This stuff you're putting on me, it's like shit. It's like rubbing shit in my face. You like doing that? Shit in your face? Your fucking face? When do I get to see your face? You out in that fucking fantasy world of yours. Come home all lovey dovey trying to honey me up... and get your piece of ass. I'm not dumb Tom. That's one thing i'm not. I never said you were dumb darling. Yeah sure you never said it. I never said that. You never said it but you sure act like it. Just like i'm some dumb broad who's gonna put up with your bullshit forever. You know, it's no picnic raising two kids Tom. One, I don't like standing in line at welfare. I don't like... having people look at me funny in the supermarket just because... because i'm using food stamps. You know, you could get your ass in gear. You could help, you son of a bitch. You think this is gonna help Darlene? You think this is gonna make me want to stay here and put up with all your shit? I mean, what? This is supposed to make me... This is supposed to make me want to get a job... this is supposed to make me get up in the morning and make money... and what? Drive that fucking truck down in that fucking hall for Anaconda? I mean, this shit, this is what i'm gonna come home to. You think i'm gonna want to do that? Yeah, I know, I know. It's not pretty, is it? Alright, ok, i'm sorry. But you know it kind of drives me up the wall having to go through all of this. 6 weeks is no small time. 6 weeks, no money, no word. Where's daddy? And what the fuck do I know? Nothing, split, again. You may have all the reasons in the world Tom. I mean, I know, I know driving trucks down that hole is no fun. I know that. But that doesn't give you the right to just up and take off... and leave me holding the bag. I gotta live my life. Yeah. I guess we're, basically we're... Darlene, Dar... Yeah. I didn't think you we're listening. I'm listening, i'm putting on my face but i'm listening. Good. So we're basically what? Well I was thinking that, I had this thought that... we're just fucked up you know. We're all of us fucked up you know? You and me and Bobby and Billy we're fucked up. The whole fucking world is fucked up. I'm not fucked up Tom. You're the one who is fucked up and I mean fucked up. You are really fucked up. Okay, okay i'm fucked up. I know that, I admit that. But you just have to say it again and again and again. Tom fucked up, Tom fucked up, Tom fucked up. What do you want me around here for anyway? I'm some piece of shit you know, just dump shit on, all the time. What is the point? You want to know something Tom? Yeah, what? I'm pregnant. We're gonna have another kid. Oh shit. Oh shit. You did it again didn't you. I did it? What do you mean I did it? We did it. You got that, we did it? We fucked, we got pregnant. So don't give me anymore of that you did it shit. Yeah we fucked, but it ain't my job to take those fucking little pills is it? You know what? You do that shit on purpose. You want to nail me to the wall. Poor little Tommy, you just can't take it. What about me? You want them to go stick a knife up my gut? I bet that's what you want isn't it? That's what you want. Just go right in and clean it up. It's simple. Sure, you never had anybody cut your gut before... you would never let anybody cut anything in your balls. Oh but they can go right in and cut up Darlene. Doesn't... Doesn't matter. So, what do you want to do? What shall we do about it? I mean are you gonna stay here? You gonna be around? You gonna do your job? You gonna be the old Tom, the Tom that I know. The one that runs away. That just can't take it, that just... poof you're gone. Am I gonna have to D-I-V-O-R-C-E you? Alimony and all that shit. Child support. I'm tired Tom and... I may love you a whole lot but sometimes I really wonder why. But, i'm not gonna take any more. You got that? I mean it. I mean if you pull any more of this shit... i'm gonna go see a lawyer, I am, I mean it. That was it, that was the last straw. Very huh? Rubber. Real funny Tom, real funny. God, can't you just be serious for one minute, just once. Listen, I have got to, know what i'm gonna do. And if you're not gonna be around here, then I am gonna do something. You ever read this? No. Hey listen to this. I just read in a magazine, that one of the most... unusual letters you ever received was from a woman.. who said that on her honeymoon, her husband wanted her to lie... in a tub of cold water for 20 minutes and then... come to bed and pretend she was dead. Boy is he weird. I would've been satisfied if on our honeymoon... my wife had taken a hot bath and come to bed pretending she was alive. You read that stuff? That's nothing but garbage. What do you mean garbage? Don't you know man, this whole thing... from page to page, is made up by some crazy little quirk in the back room. And he got nothing to do, he just pounds crap out. Tell me that ain't true. This is a letter. No man. It's all bullshit. You know, these rags are put out by the government... just to pacify people so that they forget about their real problems. The what people? The government man. They got everything. Even how to eat. Eat all the crap with all the junk in it. Did you ever read... oh wow. Who are the cowbells? How in the hell do I know? This turkey in the back room, he knows. Sitting there, thinking back to his childhood. Cowbells. I don't know. Maybe some... lover of swiss cows. Do you live here? No, i'm just passing through. What, who'd wanna live here? I don't know, not me. You believe that stuff huh? I don't know, some of it yeah. They got you too. You know animals, they got their shit together. You know they really do. You take a dog or a horse or a cow or a pig or anything man. He knows what's happening. You don't find him hanging out reading no paper. He just does what comes natural. You're about to do it, you're gonna eat. You don't find me going to no slaughterhouse now either, do you? Well man, you know. Hang out might be fun sometimes. You ate huh? I don't think so. Hadn't planned on it. That crap they're feeding you, that's putting you in the slaughterhouse. Just so somebody can make money off you. You're putting me on right? No man. If you quit reading that stuff and just do like the animals do you'll be alright. Take a rabbit, long flappy ears. What's he like to do? Eat? No he likes to hump man. Start thinking about that. I do I do. Now you're starting to get it then. Just don't think about the papers. Woman laying in bed cold like she's death. You don't believe that? When was the last night you ran into anybody like that? Last night. You been keeping some strange quarters then. -Yeah, I guess. Food's good though. Is it good here. -Yeah. Do you eat here often? No but I know it's good. How about you? Just got here. On your way through then? I guess, trying to find I job, you know. Job man, everybody's looking for a job. Heard anything? No, ain't nothing. Ain't nothing i'd wanna do. You work? No. I live off the government. Off the newspaper? No. I'm in another bureau. How do you do that? I just hang out and go to school. Let the government pay for it. Somebody else's taxes, i'm tired of paying taxes. Student huh? Well occasionally. Is that a good deal? Yeah, better than the army. I wouldn't know about that. Pay me more now than they did when I was in the army. Is that right? Just to go to school. Hang out and chase girls. Lot of girls? Oh yeah. Are they willing? As willing as they can get. How long have you... lived around here? Most of my life. Most of your life, how lucky can you be? -Well... How old are you? 22. Really, 22. You're just a kid. Well you know, it's alright getting older. Well it's all downhill from here. Oh no. Get married huh? I actually did. Married with kids huh? They know what to do, before I even do it. They do, they do. I don't know, I don't know what to think sometimes. So... When that happens, what I have to do is go away, I just go away. What do you mean by that? Well I guess i'm trying to saying that... I think you're real pretty. Well thanks, i've never received a compliment. Would you refuse another drink? This ain't no sunday school. Well you should talk. Hey Jim. What are you drinking? Bourbon and water. Bourbon and water and another double and some coca cola. You been putting that down haven't you? Shit, shit. Did I say something wrong? Maybe I don't like women telling me how to drink. Okay? I didn't mean anything by it, I was just being playful. Thank you. Playful huh? Make you feel better? I guess that mean yes. Hold off til we finish our drinks. Okay. Thank you. So, where were we? I was kissing you, remember? No before that, what were we talkking about? I remember you were... saying how pretty I was.
