RSG Five, four, three, two, one! 5:30! Today is a new day! My name is Jasmine Mijandro Lagman, and this is how I start my day. Carrots. Raw cabbage. Grandma says my tongue isn't short. It's just lazy. I need to train it... and remind it. Macaroni. Grandma! Breakfast is ready! Thank you, dear. You designed this? Yes, Grandma. How creative! Since Dad and Mom died, Grandma has raised me and my sisters, Dahlia and Violet. Have I taken my medication? Yes, Grandma. After we had breakfast, you took your medicine for hypertension. Thanks, dear! Now that they have their own families, I'm the only one left with Grandma. Five scratch-its, please. Where are last week's results? Shouldn't they be posted here? The flyer got wet. Check the results online. How will I know if I won? You should always post the results. Which lotto results do you need? 6-42? 6-45? 6-49? 6-55? 6-58? Do you have them? I want the Mega Lotto results. Mega Lotto 6-45 results for January 4, 2019: 26-27-23-14-06-21. No jackpot winners. Correct. That's exactly right! My granddaughter has never been wrong. -For real! -Let's see. Super Lotto! Super Lotto results as of January 3, 2019: 03-25-34-28-40-35. No jackpot winners. She got it right again! How impressive! Grand Lotto 6-55 results as of January 5, 2019: 28-27-26-51-42-16. No jackpot winners. -Correct. Correct! -Again? Amazing! -You're so good! -Let's take a photo! That's my grandchild! Thank God I'm good at memorizing. My skills come in handy at our caf√©. I'll have one order of matcha latte with no whipped cream. Use soy milk instead. And a dash of cinnamon on top. On second thoughts, with whipped cream. And he'll have an egg salad sandwich, but don't toast it. He likes eating cold sandwiches. And one hot chocolate. But not so hot that it burns. I'll sue you if that ever happens. And extra pickles, please. But I hate pickles! The pickles are for me. And for you? Just give her water. She's fine with that. Will that be all? Wait. You didn't list our orders? I was very particular about some of them. I remember everything. Could you repeat the order, please? One order of matcha latte with no whipped cream. Soy milk instead. Also, a dash of cinnamon on top. On second thoughts, with whipped cream. He'll have the egg salad sandwich, but we won't toast it. He likes eating cold sandwiches. One hot chocolate. But not so hot that it burns. You'll sue us if that ever happens. And extra pickles. It's not for your son because he hates pickles. It's for you. And lastly, one chocolate shake and ensaymada for Ma'am. I didn't order chocolate shake and ensaymada for my maid. It's on the house. We'll serve your orders in five to ten minutes. One order of matcha latte-- What's with the freebies? -Is she a friend of yours? -No, but I know she's hungry. Water won't be enough. Just deduct it from my salary. Grandma and I are happy. I would still often see my sisters Dahlia and Violet at family gatherings. Aunt Olive, like I told Dahlia and Violet, intermittent fasting is so effective. That's all I do. Look, I've lost so much weight! See? I can eat anything I want! But only for a restricted period. I've really lost a lot. See? That really takes discipline! You're now very sexy. I know, right? Thank you! You're not sexy. In fact, you've gained weight since you attended my debut. You're so cute. Cute, not sexy. I can't help it. I want to hug you! Ouch! Grandma! Jasmine, you should apologize. I embarrass my Grandma and sisters a lot. For some reason, I can't ever say the word, "so..." "Sorr..." Sorry, but I just can't say it. Is it true that you already have two kids? -Yes. -We wouldn't have guessed. -You don't look it. -Thank you. What about Jasmine? Isn't she going to get married? It's a shame. Pido, there's no shame in being single. I'm sure Jasmine has many admirers. Oh sure, tons! Maybe you're too choosy. What are you looking for in a man, Jasmine? I have an colleague who just came home from the US. Tall. He's very good-looking. I just want someone who prays before eating. Whenever I serve snacks to my admirers, they eat them right away without praying. A man who knows how to pray will be a good husband. Make sure your husband knows that. You didn't pray again. I will, later. After I eat. Hello, everybody! Let's begin today's celebration. We would like-- Stop! Calm down. Stop! Stop it! -Stop it! -She's just like that. Come here. Come. You're no longer a child. You should be able to control your emotions. That was so embarrassing! Dahlia, that's enough. Grandma, no offense, but someone should rein her in. This is why she's so spoiled. She's not spoiled. And no offense either, but what you're doing isn't helping. I better call the driver. I'll go with you. Jasmine, it's okay to make a mistake. Next time, try saying sorry when you say something offensive. You hurt your aunt's feelings. Saying sorry doesn't diminish you. I'm telling you this because I love you very much. I want you to learn. Okay, Grandma. Grandma, tell me about Happy again. Aren't you tired of my stories about Happy? I keep telling the same stories. I will never get tired of your stories. Once upon a time... Before you were born, they found a tumor in my body. I was terrified. I think Happy sensed it, because he showered me with affection. Then, one day, he suddenly died. I was very sad. But a week after Happy died, my tumor was gone. Grandma, Happy saved your life! This is why you have to be kind to everyone. To people and even to animals. Kindness comes back to you a millionfold. I love you, Jasmine. Where are you? Your sister is so excited to see your kids. There's so much food. It's like a fiesta. There's menudo, pancit canton, pancit luglog, grilled fish-- What happened? My hand got burned, so I dropped the pan. Calm down. My sisters are arriving any minute, and there's still so much to do. I also have to clean up here. Everything's a mess! They still have a long way to go. Do you want me to help you? I can handle this, Grandma. Everything tastes great! Who cooked these? Was it Jasmine? Can I bring home some caldereta? Do you have plastic containers? Mommy, is there dessert? I want ice cream! You should expand your coffee shop. Offer fine dining. Oh, no. It would be too much of a burden. I'm fine with how things are. -Here comes dessert! -Me first! Grandma first. You promised to see a doctor. I've told you so many times. This is nothing. Go ahead and eat. When did your cough start? You sound terrible. Why is there blood? It's nothing. Grandma, we have to go to the hospital. Your grandmother has tuberculosis. She should be placed in isolation to ensure that she doesn't infect anyone. So she has to stay in her room? -Do we have to hire a nurse? -That's not all. I'm also Jasmine's doctor. And given her immune system... I would not advise her staying with her Grandma. Grandma. Jasmine, listen to me carefully. While I am here, stay with Dahlia. I just need time to recover. I want to stay with you here. You can't. We'll both get sick. Wear this while we're apart. It will feel like I'm always by your side. You can do anything. Dahlia, even though your sister's a bit different, you don't need to worry about her. She can take care of herself. Are you okay? Are you hurt? I'm okay. Why did you suddenly cross the street? Thank God our driver was able to stop in time. I'm sorry. I was running after the ball. Ball? Don't do that again. Do you live around here? Do you want us to call your parents? Doggie, that's not yours. It's his. I'm taking it. Don't bite, okay? Doggie, that's not your toy! That's my ball. Okay, be careful next time. Thank you. Let's go, Jasmine. You're a good dog, after all. Hello, Jasmine. I'm Nurse Gem. Hello. Where's Grandma? Sorry, Jasmine. But your grandmother is resting. How did you know my name? Ever since your Grandma got here, all she talks about is you. And her old dog, too. -Happy? -Yes. So I bought her a stuffed toy to keep her company at night. Grandma! I miss you. Manang? She couldn't sleep earlier, so I sang to her. I'll have you know, I'm a singer! Would you like a sample? How does that sound? It's good that you're a nurse. You can help more people that way. Don't mention it. But you have to bear with me. It wasn't that good because the sound was choppy. The signal here is really bad. Call again tomorrow. I'll sing for you again. Okay. Bye! Who's there? Hey, Doggie! Don't be frightened. I didn't mean to scare you. You should have barked to let me know you're a dog. This is for you. I'll leave this here. If you eat it, it means we're friends. Do we have a deal? I don't get it. You just can't sleep, so you're running away? I'm not running away. I'm asking for permission. I'm not comfortable in your house. I want to go home, to Baguio. -No offense. -This is so typical of you. When you don't get what you want, you throw a tantrum. Jasmine, you need to learn to adjust to where you are. You're not the only one who's having a hard time. We all are. I don't want to give you a difficult time. I didn't even want to come here. -Besides, you're not very nice to me-- -So it's my fault again? All these years, you make me look like a villain... When all I do is look after your welfare. I'm tired of trying to understand you. I'm tired of you. You're tired of me? You don't want me here? I don't want to be here either. That is my bag! Let go of my bag! Give me my bag. Give it back! Doggie! Doggie! Doggie! Please help the dog. Please wait outside. -Was it you who brought him here? -Yes, how is he? He's okay. It's good that we were able to treat his wounds right away. He defended me from thieves. I'm worried about him, even though he's not my dog. -We've become friends, you see. -He will be just fine. But we need to keep him here for a few days because his condition is still very delicate. Okay. -Would you like to see him? -Yes, please. Mario. Hello! Hello. Hello! Happy? Happy! Happy? Grandma, you seem to be getting better! Whose dog is that, Jasmine? -He looks like Happy! -Yes, he does. He's not better yet though. He's still recovering. Do you want to be named Happy? Do you want to see him? I can bring him with me to Baguio. Jasmine! How are you? Are you happy living with your sister? No. It's not often that you get to be with your sister for a long time. I'm having a hard time. It's so noisy and chaotic here in Manila. You'll get used to it. You just need to have a routine. You know that, right? Cia. Sab. Cia. Sab. Bye. Bye! Here's a snack, Doc. Thanks! -Your snack, Doc. -Thanks. -Will you remember everything I said? -Yes, Doc. Since you always bring snacks for me, I have a gift for you. Wow! Happy. Okay. -Thank you! -Food! -Good morning! -Good morning, Aunt. -Good morning, Sab! -Good morning, Aunt Jas. Good morning, Cia. Good morning, Dahlia. -Good morning, Mark. -Good morning. Good morning. Sab, what did I teach you? Sab is our prayer leader for today. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Thank you Lord, for blessing us with yummy food this morning. May this make us healthy. Please provide food for those who are hungry today. Amen. Thank you for preparing breakfast and packing lunches for the kids. I've never seen them this excited to eat! -You're welcome. -Thank you. But you don't have to do this all the time. -I can do it. -It's okay. I wake up early anyway. -Thank you. -You're welcome, Dahlia. The kids don't like your cooking. That's why they used to skip breakfast. The same's true for Mark. Now he likes having breakfast. I'll always take care of breakfast so that your family can eat well. -Mark. -Thank you. Dahlia, this is yours. All right. Thank you. You assured us that she was under constant observation. How could that happen? Rest assured we're looking after her, but what happened was an accident. You can't always prevent accidents from happening. How is she now? Please give us more details so that we won't panic. She has been stabilized for now, but it's really important for you to get here. I need to discuss her condition with you personally. We have some new findings. -She needs you here. -Of course. We'll leave tonight. All right. I'll be here. Thank you. Sis... Something happened to Grandma? I'm going with you. You're going there, right? Jasmine, you can't be around Grandma. Please. Jasmine, you know you can't come with us. Even Grandma said so. -Just stay here while she's recovering. -I don't care. As long as I can see her. -I want to go with you. -Jasmine, stop acting up! I want to go! I want to go! I want to go! You're not listening! I want to go! I will go! Aunt Jasmine! Aunt Jasmine! I want to go! Let her be. What do you mean, "let her be"? She's hurting herself. She knows how to calm down. Grandma taught her. We need to let her do it on her own. I want to go! I want to go! I want to go! I want to go! I need to bring Happy to Grandma. When she got sick before, she suddenly got well because of a dog. Maybe a dog can save her again. What can Happy do to save her? I don't know. But whenever we talk and I show her Happy, she becomes happy too. Happy? Are you going to save Grandma again? But Mom will never allow you to go there. Happy and I need to go to Grandma. I'm going home, even if I have to go alone. Aunt, do you know how to go home on your own? No. Well, one can find out anything on the Internet. How... to get to... Baguio? Baguio. That's a lot of money! Why don't they want to give us a ride, Happy? It's wet back there. Sit here, in front. Okay. I'm hungry. -Would you like a sandwich? -All right. I've been driving all afternoon, and I haven't eaten until now. Not eating at regular hours isn't good for you. I have no money to spare. I need to save for my child's hospitalization. What is your child's illness? They don't know what it is. She's been in and out of the hospital. Even faith healers can't tell what's wrong with her. Are we going in the right direction? According to the map, we should have gone past a church much earlier. No, this is a shortcut. A shortcut that's taking much longer? This was supposed to be a hold-up. No, that's bad. Why would you do that to me? My bag has already been snatched. I have a gun. Don't scream. It's not real. I'm really not a bad person. I don't think you're a bad person. See? Happy likes you. Even if your dog likes me, I still have a hospital bill to pay. Here's my money. There's no need for a hold-up. It's all yours. Thank you. But this isn't enough. I don't have any more money. That's all of it. The only thing left is my mobile phone. No, it would be shameful to take it. That's okay. It's yours. I'd be heartless if I took that from you. -Okay, so don't. -Wait. I could pawn this. That would help. -Thank you. -Okay. And there's more food here. You need it more than I do. There are also drinks in here to wash it all down. There's also tissue, just in case you spill some, -and you need to clean up. -You're too kind. You're like the Virgin Mary. That's too much. My Grandma taught me that, if you're going to help someone, you should go all out. Don't just give for the sake of giving. Give everything you can. -Really? -Yes. Is it okay if I drop you off here? I'm going home now so I can take my child to a hospital. -Is that okay? -Okay. Thank you. You're welcome. Bye! This was supposed to be my day off. It's Karl who should be working right now. Boss, can't we take a break and grab a bite? We're starving. I know I screwed up. Let's just take a break together later. Let's finish our pending orders, please. Boss, we will never run out of customers. There will always be new ones. I'm begging you. If you want, I will double your salary. No. It's okay. I'll say yes to you. Say yes to what? I'm not courting you. You're not? Well, help me anyway. Come in. Boss, we're really hungry. We'll just go home. I'll say yes to you too! I'm so hungry, it's making me dizzy. You kept delaying our break time! I can't do this anymore. I quit! Wait. Don't leave me, hey! -I've been waiting for my adobo. -What about my T-bone? Who ordered the adobo? She ordered adobo. -Miss, I'll have a barbecue. -Where's the barbecue? In the kitchen. Over there. Here you go. I'll do it. Let me do it. How embarrassing. -Thank you. -Welcome. -Menu, please. -Oh, the menu. Is that your assistant? -Yes, that's Happy. -Yeah, Ha... Jasmine? Where's your Aunt Jasmine? What's wrong? Tell her. Let me do that. Thank you. -Have you eaten? -No, not yet. Happy and I are so hungry. Okay, have a seat. I'll get you some food. Thank you. Happy, let's go. We're finally gonna eat. -Here. -Oh, wow! -Thank you! -There's rice and chop suey. There's adobo. And this is for Happy. -Thank you. -All right. Oh, can I also have barbecue? I already brought you two meats. Okay, some barbecue then. Hey, thanks for helping out. If you hadn't done that, I would have lost a lot of money. My customers would have got tired waiting. I get confused. -Here's your barbecue. -Wow. Thank you. Where are you off to? Why haven't you eaten? We're going home to Baguio. To my Grandma. I promised my grandmother that I would bring Happy there. But I don't have money anymore. The taxi driver got everything I had. He needed the money for his sick child. No offense, but I heard your staff earlier. They were hungry. No one can work hungry. I know. But if I'd let them have a break, I wouldn't have been able to handle everything. So there. My Grandma says... people are more important than money. In our coffee shop, our staff have been with us since the beginning. We keep their stomachs full. You know what? Your Grandma's right. As much as I want to keep helping you, Happy and I have to go. Thank you for the food. That's okay. -Can I bring this with me? -Sure. -Take it. -Thank you. I better take you to the terminal where you can find a bus to Baguio. Give this to them. Here's more. -This is mine? -Yes, it's all yours. Take this too. That's everything I earned today. Thank you! Ask them first if you can bring Happy. -Why? -Some buses don't allow pets. -Okay? -Okay. Don't forget your barbecue. -Can I have a drink? -Of course. Come with me. Do you want a drink, too? I still can't reach her. Just keep trying. The bus bound for Baguio is still here. We're off to Baguio! We're now in Pagudpud. If this is your stop, you better get up! I need to pee. Happy, we're on the wrong bus. We're lost. Excuse me. Is there a bus bound for Baguio where we're going? Yes, there is. -Can you show me once we're there? -All right. Let Grandma sit there. That's a priority seat What? But there are so many available seats! You've got a lot of nerve! That's a priority seat. Just let it be. I can sit elsewhere. Take my seat, Grandma. Happy and I can sit at the back. Thank you. You're such a kind child. I'm no longer a child. What's happening here? Kick her off the bus. She has a dog! She's upsetting the passengers. A real troublemaker! Why did you bring a dog here? What if it poops? Please get off the bus. Happy? Stay here, okay? I'll see if we can cross this river. Happy! Happy! I can do this. But I didn't do anything! Mom, are you telling me that this cellphone shut down on its own? -I didn't touch it! -So was it magic? Just fix it. Come on. I've taught you this so many times, but you keep forgetting. I already have so much on my mind. How can I remember that? Just do it, stop yakking. I told you to just get a landline. Is that a corpse? She's dead! A corpse! A corpse! Stop overreacting. Let's just help her! Mom, that's the last of my money. Tell Nonoy to try being frugal. Okay, fine. Even if I feel bad about it. -I will borrow money from Pol. -Mom, that loan shark again? When will you learn? This is why your life isn't any better. -You're awake. -Who are you? -Where am I? -How are you feeling? Where's my dog? Happy? Happy. -Happy. -Who's Happy? Happy? Happy? She sure doesn't seem happy! -Happy! -Who's Happy? When we saw you in the market, you didn't have a dog with you. I really had Happy with me. We were going to my Grandma in Baguio. You might never see your dog again. The people here don't like dogs, especially those just roaming around. Why? They're good-natured. And they bite and have rabies. Dogs only bite bad people. Yeah, right. Dogs stink. They smell like... dogs. Dogs only become smelly when you don't give them a bath. You, in fact, smell like fish. I just couldn't tell you. It's impolite to call out someone with body odor. -No offense. -Excuse me! Chuchay! You're scaring her. Don't worry. We're going to help you find Happy. -Really? -Are you serious? For real! Sit down. Let's eat. I'm getting dizzy from hunger and from watching you. Take a seat. I'll sit beside you even if you smell like... I'd rather not say. Fish! Look, there it is! Fish! You smell alike. I need to find Happy. He's my only companion. He will help save Grandma so she can get well. We won't stop until we find Happy. Thanks, Chuchay. You're nice, after all. You were annoying at first. -You're brutally honest, Beh. -My name is Jasmine, not Beh. -Okay, Beh. -It's not Beh. Jasmine! Jasmine Beh. DOGS MUST BE ON A LEASH STRAY DOGS WILL BE IMPOUNDED -Just Jasmine. -Beh Jasmine. Get used to it, Jasmine. Chuchay and I rarely get along. I don't get Chuchay. As time passes, she loses patience with me more easily. You saw how she shouts at me like it was nothing. Yes. But maybe shouting at each other is your way of showing concern. Maybe. Or maybe she finds me stubborn. Old people can be stubborn. My Grandma is stubborn. She doesn't listen. She didn't want to see a doctor, so, now, she's sick. But I try to understand her because I used to be stubborn too. Yet, she gave me care and understanding. I want to take care of her this time. Your Grandma is lucky to have you. I'm lucky too, because she loves me. And she always lets me know that. You're lucky with Chuchay, too. Maybe she just ends up shouting because she wants to be heard. You should listen sometimes. I'm not saying it's ugly. I've just never seen eyelashes that look like fans. Bakla! Your honesty is unbelievable. I'm helping you find your dog, yet you're putting me down. Did I say something wrong? No offense. And I'm not a homosexual bakla person. I'm a girl. No, "bakla" is just what you call your besties. "Bakla" or "baks" or "beks." -Like that! -I see. -Right. -Chuchay! Je! I heard you're looking for a dog? -Yes, have you seen it? -No, sorry. All I know is that stray dogs are captured and then brought to the pound. -Really? -Yes. So, if I were you, I'd go to the pound near the barangay hall. Thank you! You're a big help. -Don't mention it. -Now, we know where to look. Jasmine, thank my friend. At last, we have a lead on Happy. Hi. Thank you, bakla. Hey! -I thought he was your friend? -Yes, he is. But... -Oh, never mind. -Thanks, bakla. -The place is near the barangay hall. -Okay. -Quit it. -What? There are no more dogs here. Happy isn't here. Are you sure you don't have any dogs? Just to be sure, here's what he looks like. He's a white dog with a lot of brown spots He's this small, and this long. I think we had one like that the other day. -But he's not here anymore. -Where did you take him? Either his owner claimed him, or he was brought to the center... to... Sorry, but there's a possibility that he was put to sleep. What does that mean? Jasmine. It means that Happy... is probably dead. Jasmine... Jasmine! You kill dogs? You're bad people! Give Happy back to me! Bad people! -Where is this center? -I'm sorry. We're not allowed to tell you that, according to the Mayor's ordinance. -Don't be so heartless. -You're evil! Give me back my dog! This can't be happening. It can't! It can't! It can't! No, Jasmine. We'll find a way. We'll find a way. What am I going to do? -Do you want to get a cat? -No! -I want Happy! Bring Happy back to me! -Maybe we can still get your dog. Let's go after our vehicle. It's on its way to the center. When I got this job, I thought I'd just be taking care of dogs. I'll have you know, I'm a dog lover. I didn't expect my job to be like this. It's good you listened to your conscience. I pitied her. I think I would react that way too, if I lost my pet dog. I thought our Mayor would change his stance. I've been thinking about resigning. Good. Find a job that doesn't require killing dogs. I will resign immediately. Tomorrow! On second thoughts, I'm going to wait for our 13th-month pay. That's months away! I will resign in due time. I hope we can still get to your dog before it's too late. Go faster, please. We need to save Happy. Happy! There are no dogs here. Where are the dogs? I just took a toilet break, and a dog escaped. Brought the others with it. Was there a white dog with brown spots? He's this small and this long. I don't know. They're all a pain in the ass. Happy is not a pain in the ass! You are because you kill dogs. Listen. Let's just look for them. They're probably just around here somewhere. -Okay. Happy? -Happy! Happy, come! Happy! Happy! Hello, Mom? Chuchay, come quick! There are so many dogs here! Happy? Happy! Happy! -Why are there so many dogs? -I don't know where they came from. Jasmine, do you think these are the dogs from the pound? Happy isn't here. Happy! -Mom! -That's Happy? What about the other dogs? They have nowhere to go. I can't bring them with me. I know. What if we adopt one? That one! Yeah, okay. Let's do that! Mom, that one! I now have a dog. Yay! Maybe you'd like to have one, too. -All right. I'll take one home, too. -I want one, too! Let me take one! Jasmine, they're taking the dogs home. Chuchay, I can go to Baguio on my own. Besides, Happy will be with me. But I want to go with you and Happy. What if they kick you off the bus again? And I'm not saying that I want to take a vacation in Baguio, but maybe I do! Okay. I'll say yes, bakla! There. You got it, baks. You've been teaching her nothing but foolishness. I want to thank you and Chuchay for helping me. It's a good thing I fainted where I did. Otherwise, who knows what could have happened to us? Don't mention it, Jasmine. Here's your necklace. Take care of it. Okay. -Goodbye. -Bye! -Take care, okay? -I will. -Chuchay! -Mom. Take care, too. Don't get too dramatic, Mom. I will bring you purple yam jam and strawberry jam. Don't forget to buy a broom. Take care. Bye! -Bye, Mom! -Bye! Goodbye! Thanks, Happy, for coming back. Thank you too, Chuchay. I wouldn't have found him without your help. Thank you, too. Why? I didn't help you with anything. I heard you talking to Mom at the market. You're right. I hadn't noticed that I've been quick-tempered with her. I find Grandma stubborn too. But what if she dies? What if your mom suddenly dies? Don't talk that way. But you have a point. Fine. From now on, I'll try to be more patient. I will lower my voice and stop giving her such a hard time. -Okay? -There. You got it, bakla. Ma'am, excuse me. Dogs are not allowed inside. Let us in. It's important that my Grandma sees us so she can get well. -Happy will save my Grandma's life. -I'm sorry, ma'am, but it's not allowed. What kind of a hospital is this? Ma'am. It's hospital policy, ma'am. "It's hospital policy, ma'am!" I'm going to report you to the MTRCB and DENR, if I faint and get dizzy because you insist on your so-called policy! Chuchay, why are you shouting? -Why am I shouting? -Why are you shouting? Why am I shouting? Because of this... This... Ma'am, come on. This is too much. Ma'am... -I'll go get a nurse. -Hold on. Don't talk to my dead body. Jasmine? Jasmine. Nurse Gem. I am Nurse Gem. Nurse Gem! Nurse Gem! What a cute dog! I need to bring Happy to Grandma. What? The hospital doesn't allow pets. We know, but it's important for Grandma to see Happy. Don't cry. It's okay. Stop crying. Don't cry anymore. Please stop crying now. This is what we'll do. Give Happy to me. I can sneak him in better than you can. -You'll bring Happy there? -Yes, I'll take care of it. Go straight to your Grandma's room, okay? -Okay. Give him to me. -You and Happy will go there, too? -Yes, I'll take care of him. -Okay, but please don't lose him. -Please. -Yes, I'll make sure. -Okay. -Go. -Go to your Grandma. -Bye, Happy. Bye! Thank you, Nurse Gem! -Bye! -Go ahead. Happy! Stay with me for a while. Let's go to the pantry. It's got great acoustics. I'll sing to you. Come. Jasmine? Grandma? -Grandma! -Jasmine! Where have you been? We were going crazy looking for you. I wanted to go to Grandma, but I got lost. Of course, you got lost! You ran away! Grandma's not well, and you chose to act up. All you think about is yourself! It's always about you. You don't care about other people's feelings. You're so selfish! That's enough. Jasmine, where have you been? Are you okay? We were worried something had happened to you. Sister... Sorry. Sister, I'm sorry. I don't know what I'd do if something happened to you. I don't know, Jasmine. We didn't know where to find you. Every day since you've been gone, it's been hard to breathe. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, too. I love you, Jasmine. Happy wants to join us. Group hug. Grandma will be glad to see you. For sure. But can I make a request? What is it? Let me and Happy take care of Grandma. Of course. Thank you. Grandma? Grandma! Grandma! Look, Happy's here. It's Happy. Happy? Thank God, you're back! You told me that Happy saved your life once. Well, he's here to save you again. Isn't that right, Happy? I'm just glad that my two favorite beings are here. Wait. How did you get here? I got a lot of help, Grandma. Your grandma is not doing well. She's not responding to the treatment. Maybe being in the hospital depresses her. It might help if you bring her home, especially with her birthday coming up. It might be better if she's in a familiar place, surrounded by familiar faces. HAPPY BIRTHDAY GRANDMA OLIVE WE LOVE YOU! Never leave her. Always take good care of her. Grandma! Grandma! You should get some rest. Sleep now. You got tired earlier. Grandma... thank you for taking care of me. Thank you... for loving me. Thank you... for teaching me to be strong. I love you, Grandma. I love you, Grandma. Grandma. Grandma. Happy's waking you up. Grandma. Grandma? Grandma. Grandma! Grandma, wake up. Grandma, wake up. Sister Dahlia! Sister Dahlia! Sister Dahlia! I'll call an ambulance. Jasmine, would you like to have that? Okay. Thank you. Look at Grandma. I miss her. This was Jasmine's birthday. I can do this, Grandma. How old was she here? Five, four, three, two, one! 5:30! Today is a new day! I miss you, Grandma. I love you. I'm doing great. Someday, we will be together again. But for now, I have them. Rice. Liver. Gizzard. Rice. Liver. I'm sure Grandma is happily watching me now. Her wish for me was pretty simple. She wanted me to be happy and never alone. That became true! I have a lot of companions now... because Happy... had so many babies! Feeding time! Sister Violet says life goes on. Sister Dahlia let me live in Baguio on my own with Happy. But I have to text them every hour and call every night, even when I have no stories to tell. Here's your order, sir. They visit me every weekend. Thank you. Bakla. Have you noticed? That guy has been coming here a lot, and he's always staring at you. He's cute! I told you, no chitchat during working hours. He always prays before eating. Sorry.
