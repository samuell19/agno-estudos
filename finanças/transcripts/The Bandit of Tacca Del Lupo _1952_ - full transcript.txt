THE BANDIT OF THE TACCA DEL LUPO After the decline of the Bourbon reign, the unification of Italy is now complete. The enthusiasm that Garibaldi's quest for liberation had... ... stirred up among the Southern people is now largely dampened. The farmers, oppressed by ages of poverty, were inclined to place blame upon the... ...new Piedmontese Government, and call for the return of the King of Naples. Thus, between the remaining, scattered members of the Bourbon Army and the poor... ... Southern farmers, there has developed the phenomenon of banditry... ...which would employ the soldiers of the North at length in a cruel guerrilla war. We came to Melfi to restore justice and order! The Piedmontese, who God has so cursed, have destroyed justice... ... but we will restore it at once! Garibaldi, with the excuse of liberating you people... ... will make you pay taxes to fatten Vittorio Emanuele... ... who wants to become the King of everything as if he were God himself. We already have a King, and this God will never remove him! We will pray and fight to the death to save him! So, in the name of his majesty, Francesco the Second... ... I order that the town safe be handed over immediately... ... including all the tax money. I order that all liberal traitors are to be severely punished... ... so that they learn! I order that no man in the area is exempt from becoming a soldier. And we will burn all of those who are against our king! Long live Francesco the Second, our King! Long live the King! - Fall in! To your places, sound the horns! - Fall in! This is Melfi. Yesterday we received news that the town has been reoccupied... ... taken from the control of the company that you are to command. For three days now the bandits have remained in charge. They have plundered, they have killed, they have burned... Nonetheless, in assuming control of the place they have been greeted like liberators. "The Southern people continue their fight..." "... against the oppression of the so-called New Italian State." "The revolutionaries are achieving clamorous success all over." "The people welcome them with banners supporting the King of Naples." Occurrences such as this one at Melfi are happening too often. And the press only profits from it. There are too many people that have political motives and interests... ... in this phenomenon of banditry. Have you sent someone to investigate? A superintendent from the police headquarters at Foggia, an experienced man. And ex-official of the Bourbon police who is now working with us. A wonderful idea, that of Garibaldi, to help liberate the Southern people. He should be here now, as well, to help fight this war against bandits. Who goes there? I am the new Captain of the company. Where is the man in charge? - Vanzato, take the Captain through. - Yes, Sir. Second Lieutenant De Giustino. Captain Giordani. We weren't expecting you at this hour, I shall go and wake Lieutenant Magistrelli. No, he is not on duty and has the right to sleep, I will see him in the morning. Now I wish to find myself a bed, a cot, to rest for a few hours. Yes, Captain, Sir. If my room will satisfy you for tonight... Good, and please sort out food and lodging for my orderly. And punish that Bersagliere guarding the mules who has fallen asleep. Yes, Captain, Sir. This way, Captain, Sir. - And the escort? - What escort? - You have travelled at this hour without an escort? Yes, why? - Is this it? - Yes, Captain, Sir. - That is all I require. - Until tomorrow. - Tomorrow, Captain, Sir. Company, attention! Wake up... At ease! Come on, what are you doing here? Fall in! Come on, wake up! Company, attention! - He's finally arrived. - Yes, last night, alone. Come on, slobs, let's go! At ease! Company, attention! Present, arms! Fourth company, 85 men present, 10 wounded in the infirmary. - At ease. - Company, at ease! - Where is he? - He hasn't come out yet. Here he is! Quick, to your places. To your places! Company, attention! At the ready! 85 men present, 25 on duty, 10 wounded in the infirmary. Lieutenant Righi. At ease. Company, remove! Shoulder, arms! At ease! Get the men in order, present the company to me again in one hour. - But, Sir... - Do not tell me that the unit has been out here for three years. To maintain discipline you must respect form. Last night one of the officials on duty was asleep... ... and today they present themselves with extremely untidy uniforms. - I gave you 5 days to prepare for my arrival. - Yes, Sir. - I haven't finished. You are restless, Lieutenant. Extremely nervous, and it shows. Three years hunting bandits, among people who hate us... - Believe me, it's a tough job. - But your job is to defend the town. - Has the investigation started? - A superintendent from Foggia has arrived. - Superintendent Siceli ? - Yes, the documents are in the town hall. - Get someone to take me. - Lieutenant Righi! Take me to the town hall. Half an hour to arrange uniforms, under the judgement of the squad leaders. - Break ranks! - Company, attention! Break ranks! - The town hall is here, Captain, Sir. - Thank you, you may go. - Have you been here for three years, too? - Yes, Captain, Sir. - How old are you? - 22, Captain, Sir. Off you go. Let me pass! Let me pass. My respects, Captain, Sir. Usher! They are all in a meeting to discuss the investigation. They have summoned the entire town. The witnesses... The relatives of victims... But those who know do not speak. - Usher... - It doesn't matter, thank you. Captain! Captain, Sir! Domenico Strafaci, land surveyor and patriot. At your service, Captain, Sir. And tell them that if they do not have the power to maintain order... Captain Giordani? Superintendent Francesco Siceli. It is an honour, Captain. It's best if we close these. Please, come in. We are very pleased to have you with us. If I may? The Mayor, Baron Lo Cascio. The town clerk, Rosario Cottafava... ... the town councillors, Carcano, Bellusci, De Franco, Cuffaro... All gentlemen. Baron Lo Cascio... ... was outlining to us the official version of this most painful episode. The victims are numerous, and the damage considerable, Captain. 15 dead, 4 houses burnt to the ground, 3 citizens taken as hostages... ... extortion, theft, the town safe has been stolen... - I had to hand over money, livestock... - Me, too! But if the government cannot provide the means to protect us... Are these gentlemen here as witnesses or as defendants? Well, we have been discussing it all meticulously. In fact, despite such dramatic circumstances... ... many still support the bandits. The people have been stirred up, but we will all be left ruined. It's unpleasant, but the people have actually sided with their over-throwers. Gosh, Captain, when such responsibility exists, we will not turn away from it. But I believe, or we should believe, that we're dealing with mere formal support. A form of subconscious, powerless acceptance so as to avoid a greater trouble. But for now we should simply thank the representents of the people... ... for their valuable contributions. Mr Mayor, Baron... One moment. Wait for me outside, without going too far from the town hall. Is it true that the authorities have greeted these bandits as if they were liberators? And that the Mayor now displays the same flag seen on the horse of Raffa Raffa ? These gentlemen, my dear Captain, wretched men, useless men... ... know only how to shake income from ground upon which they do not work. They're capable of just about any cowardice in order to defend these privileges. Yes, Sir, they have greeted the bandits as liberators and the Mayor has put up the flag. - And you, what measures have you taken? - What can I do, my dear Captain? Report them? That would put me against the people, and then what would I achieve? And who knows if they really haven't allowed for the avoidance of greater troubles. Do you know why banditry endures? Because the people are more afraid of them than of us. We need to get it into their heads that the Bourbon Reign is over... ... that Italy is now complete, and that we are the strongest. Come, come... Come and see, Captain. Come... Look. Do you see that smoke on the hills? Perhaps it's from shepherds, but perhaps it's from bandits or their look-outs. That entire area is under their control, and none of us have ever put a foot there. You cannot make a single move without that movement being seen and reported. It's a tricky situation, complex... And you wish to resolve it with guns? We need to take our time, dear Captain. Time, patience, and politics. Yours is very much a Bourbon point of view. I believe that those responsible for this mess are those who think and operate as you do. The victims of the bandits are on your conscience. I see that you, too, consider us Southerners... ... as people of the earth, the flowers, and the meat... ... just like the newspapers of the North. Colonized people. Of course, we have much to learn. But consider that these poor people have lived in ignorance through decades of hardship. They tolerate and support both soldiers and bandits in exactly the same way. And yes, it's true, they have sided with with bandits. But what do you expect from them? They know of earth upon which they toil... ... and of the Saint to whom they pray, to whom they ask for bread for their family. And they also know that the new Government has only brought them taxes and the draft... ... that they didn't have before. But you want to use force? Hell, Captain... You're an excellent soldier, I'm sure. Military speaking, you know more than I. However, we are to work together so it's better to make this clear from the outset I shall head out into the country as soon as I can... ... do you intend to join this expedition and give it your full support? - I will remain here, Captain. - One might say that you're afraid. Afraid? Of course I'm afraid. You are a soldier, I am a policeman. I will work, modestly, from here. With my means, my confidants, my informers. Modestly. A cop... That's exactly what I thought. - Good luck. - And to you, Captain. - In the meantime perhaps we should conclude this investigation? - Yes, come on. Sort out and file a report against all those who have given their support to the bandits... ... and arrange for the arrest of both the Mayor and the town clerk. The military command of the area orders... ... that anyone who is found in possession of arms... ... anyone who is found to have helped or supported the bandits... ... anyone who is found in the country without a valid reason for being there... ... will be executed on the spot. The houses of those who have shown hospitality to the bandits... ... will be burned and destroyed. We will take away the bandits' bases, their supplies, their accomplices. Let it be known that we are not facing soldiers... ... but a mob of thieves, killers and rapists. They will never accept this fight... ... until they are backed into a corner like the wolf in its den. And in the den we will take them. We will track them down and capture them in the wildest and most inhospitable places. It is us, now, who must root out the bandits. It is use who attack and destroy them. We will not return across the plain... ... until we have annihilated Raffa Raffa and his gang once and for all. Until we have restored peace to the villages that we have been entrusted to defend. Company, march. Company, march! Company, attention! Right flank, Right! - Second platoon, right flank! - March! One-two ! One-two ! One-two ! One-two ! Lieutenant, Sir! We have been spotted, that is a new signal. We could be attacked at any moment. How far are we from Cervara? It should be just up there, over that crest. No troops have ever passed through that village? I have always followed orders, my area of jurisdiction finished at Melfi. - It might be better to spread the soldiers out. - No, that will just slow down the march. The village should be close. 10 minutes rest. Halt! 10 minutes rest! - Hey, Ferrioli, what a place for a vineyard. - Sure, up here it never freezes over. - Allievi ! - Present! - Borsei ! - Passignana ! - Here! - Rovere! - Present! - Martinelli ! - Here! Hey, look, Busacchi has his own little communion. Eat it all, idiot, tomorrow you'll have no teeth left! - Busacchi! - Present! - Tubino. - Present. Tubino! - Tubino! - Hey! - What is it, blockhead?! I'm here, but my stomach hurts. Your stomach hurts, does it? Aren't you ashamed? All of us have stomach-ache! Mine is worse than yours and I have a wife and kids. You disgust me! - Remember that a Bersagliere must take seven more steps after death. - Celli ! Celli ! - I'm here. - Why don't you respond "present"? - If I say that I'm here, then I'm present. Trying to be clever, are we? The wise one is finally among us. Enough eating fatty meat... At the ready! Onward! Three men up ahead. What are you doing here? - What are you doing here? - Working. Did you hear gunshots? I didn't hear anything. - Have you seen anyone pass? - No. Lieutenant, Sir, we found this. Bandit things. We need to reach the village at once. Move out! - Let's go! - Be on the lookout. Forward! Smile, you've got yourself a new hat. First platoon, at the ready! Attention! At ease! - The Piedmontese. - Attention! - Fourth platoon, halt! Together! Let them have a rest. Come, Lieutenant. - Fourth platoon, at ease! - First platoon, at ease! - What's wrong with this child? - He has the evil eye. What do you mean, "evil eye"? This is Trachoma. Hey, bring the first aid kit. Do you know who we are? We are soldiers of the King of Italy. Italians, like yourselves. We have come to free you from the bullying of these bandits. Is there anyone who wishes to help us? All we need to know is how long ago they left. And if they still had three prisoners with them. They will never talk. They're afraid. Then they will need to learn to be afraid of us as well. - Bring the company forward. - Yes, Sir! Did you hear what I said back there? Do you want to help us find the bandits? No. And you? There are no bandits here. Company, at the ready. Company, attention! Right flank! Search the village from top to bottom. Everyone out of their houses. First platoon! Forward, march! One-two! One-two! - Quick, out of the houses. - Come on, be quick about it! Out! In we go! - Get them out! Move it, women! - Come on! You, over there! Come on, hurry up! - Hey, you! - Move it! - The other side! - Move it, come on! - Move, move! Out of the way! - Someone should sort you out! - And be quiet! - Sort you out good and proper! Bastards! Everyone out! What are you doing here? - Why aren't you outside with the others? - I'm sick. What's wrong with you? You're wounded! Who shot you? Sergeant! Sergeant! Halt! Stop there! He's getting away! Stop! The Virgin Mary. Lieutenant, Sir... we found this in the house. A Bersagliere's coat. This is blood. For having been found with military garments in their houses... ... for having given help and shelter to bandits, for the illegal holding of arms... ... and for the attempted acts of hostility towards armed forces of the State... ... the accused, deemed guilty of conniving with armed gangs... ... that against the security of the State... ... on the basis of the enforced laws of War... ... are condemned to the penalty of death by execution. - Ready! - No ! - Fire! Hey, look. - Halt! - Halt! - Come here. - No, let me go! What do you want? - Walk, don't yell! - Leave me alone! - No! What are you doing? - What's going on? No, curse you! Let me go! - No, no! - Hey, bring her back here! Leave me alone! What do you want from me? - Let me go, I want to go! - Come on. - No, no. - What a beautiful bandit! - If all bandits are like this, I'm joining! Poor girl, God knows what happened to her. - Who is this woman? - We found her just outside the camp. She wanted to run away, Captain, Sir, she bit me here. Send for the medic. Come on, make way. Get out of here. - Make way, make way. Out of the way. - Move it! - Come on, get out of here. Come on, a beautiful girl like yourself shouldn't be afraid of anything. What are you doing in these parts? Where do you live? Come on, answer me. She's in shock, Captain, Sir. These primitive people are good liars, perhaps she's a confidant of Raffa Raffa. That devil, I hope he rots in hell! And that his body is cut into pieces! You know these people better than me, try to make her explain. - Then report back to me. - Yes, Sir. - It's better if I speak to her alone. - Okay. Did Raffa Raffa hurt you? Are you running away? Where are you running from? From your mother's house? From home, from my husband. From your husband? But... what happened to him? We were in love. For how long were you married? Listen... we can help you. Raffa Raffa is our enemy as well. Where was he when you ran away? We are also looking for revenge. My husband is a man of honour. - Get her something to eat. - Yes, Sir. One ration for the prisoner. Come on! - Hey, who wants to take it to her? - Me! - I'll take it to her. Guys, guys, that's enough! Make way for the meal! Here. - There's no need to be fussy. - She knows that you made it. - Do you like eggs? - Where did you get that? - The Sergeant laid it. You're not giving much confidence! Idiot! - Look at these apples. - Do you want some grappa? - Come on... Leave her alone. Don't you see that she's in a state of shock? Hey, she likes music! Let me pass. What is it? Leave her in peace. Get out of here. She won't say any more, Captain, Sir. I don't intend to interrogate her. Ger her a blanket and order some men to stand guard for tonight. You don't need to be afraid, it's dark now but tomorrow morning you can leave. Out of here. Out of here, bastard! Out of here or I'll crack your over the skull with that. Halt! Stop! Stop! Halt! - Where's Carmine? - We don't know. - Is he alive? - He left when Raffa Raffa passed through here. Tell me where Carmine is. You can't stay here, Zita Maria. Go back to your father. We know that it's not your fault... ... but you must not bring dishonour into our brother's house. The primitive state of the Southern people is not some kind of pretext... ... that serves as propaganda with which you can justify outside intervention. - You cannot ignore Mazzini, Baron. - Mazzini? What's he saying? Claiming that we should treat these people as though they are foreigners? The South cannot remain indifferent to this progress that is changing the world. - Waiter, an iced coffee. - Ha, progress! - An iced coffee. - What would this "progress" be? - What do you mean, "what would it be?" - Evolution, freedom. - Freedom?! How many have died in the name of freedom? Progress only brings scepticism. Our people are too steeped in tradition... ... to ever lose their antique customs. - Gentlemen. - Good day, Superintendent. My daughter! My daughter... Mother! Mother... My little girl.. Close that window. From now on we will keep them closed. Whoever hurt me will die! Die at the hands of Carmine, my husband! - Who are you? What do you want? Good day, Lieutenant. - Do you know this man? Yes, he served as a Lieutenant in the Bourbon army. - Did you come to know him then, or later? - Later. I always spoke to the Lieutenant when the useless spilling of blood could be avoided. I have come here for the same reason. Such contacts may exist if you are facing a regular army, but not in this case. And we must never forget this. A bandit can never be trusted, nor negotiated with. Captain, Sir, the lieutenant is trustworthy enough. If he's here, it is only with grave motive. I deal with the lives of the hostages, including yours. Raffa Raffa intends to execute those poor men... ... in retaliation for what happened at Cervara. But he is willing to return them to you, if you choose not to proceed with this march. Turn back! Continue and you will be attacked in every way and from every angle. Your men will fall, one by one. This country is not your country. We will defend the King of Naples and all that belongs to our King! Tell that bandit that we will be at Sant'Andrea by tonight and that I hope to see his face! If you kill those hostages that will be one more debt to pay! For their lives you must answer, you just as all the rest. Get out of here, now! A soldier that unites with a gang of criminals should lose the right to wear uniform. - You should be executed on the spot. - Ha, you think I care about life? Move the company forward. Use one of the platoons as an advance guard. First platoon, forward! Hey, over there! Check his pulse. The hostages... Company, move out! There! - Hey, guys! Anything ? - Nothing, nobody. - Carry on. "Hail Mary, full of grace; the Lord is with thee..." Officer, in the name of God please spare these poor people further pain. Do you think that I enjoy doing this? I have fought for Italy, and still I fight for Italy. Return to your houses, and do not be afraid of us We'll get it out, we'll get it out, the young man is a strong one. Good... you've done well, and you're doing well now... ... as a Bersagliere. I don't want to die here, I want to go home. No, I don't want it! I don't want! No! No, no! No, no! Bandage! Done, done. It's over, well done. - Sergeant. - Here's the boss. - He's on a donkey! - What a lovely couple! It looks like he's got a bowl of porridge on his head. - Well, look at this place! - What's under your hat, a bowl of stew? Oh, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus. Oh, Mother of God. - Boys. - Evening. - Evening. - Superintendent, you're here? - Evening, Captain, good to see you again. Greetings, Lieutenant. Has there been a battle? No, the bandits left the village without a fight. - How did you get here? - On the back of a mule, Captain, Sir. I'm stiff as a board, I've been travelling for 3 days. I didn't take the same route as you. - And these men? - My guides, Captain. - Armed? They work for me, Captain. I, too, am an officer you know. You must be a well-respected one if you can ride through these parts safely. Have you come to speak with me? Have you some information to give me? No, I only need a bed, just a bed. Tomorrow I will go on. - Anyway... I would like to see you again before you leave. - Of course. But... Before they abandoned the village, Raffa Raffa killed the hostages. He offered me their safe release if we chose not to continue on this quest. I knew all three of them, Captain. Three gentlemen, fathers of families. Captain, the officer invites you to the vicar's house for coffee. Listen... the wolves. In my grandmother's village... ... with a moon this bright you would be better off shelling corn. Do you remember shelling corn? I bet that up here they don't even know what corn is. Go on, Tonin, we'll all be back home before long. Not all of us, Captain, Ferrioli will never shell corn again. Do we still have much ahead of us, Captain, Sir? The men are all very tired. They say that we'll never catch the bandits anyway. - And what do they say about me? - Well, us soldiers... with superiors... This mule track doesn't exist, officer, I can assure you of that. The map is incorrect. There are some trails, but up here they're difficult to follow. They're trails that are traced out and then lost in the scrub. - Is there water? - Depending on the season. There are no springs, but when it rains small, stagnant streams are formed... ... water that has eroded the rock into crevices and caves. You really need to know the place, but there is nobody to guide you. The coffee is getting cold. I'm sorry you were made to wait. Please, sit down. I will need to spend some time outlining the orders for the day before we turn in. That means only a few hours to rest. But it's critical that the operation is clear before we begin. Thank you. - The third platoon, yours, Lieutenant... - Yes, Sir. ... will be divided into seven patrol groups. Will need to find a place out there in the wild... ... a place without of inhabitants, accessible from this mule track. - The mule track doesn't exist, it's a mistake on the map. - Are you sure of this? Could be, but it's not important. The bandits have been forced out of their bases... ... they are taking refuge in an area that is both wild and inhospitable. So we will need to comb the area methodically. The gang will be forced to fight so as to avoid capture. The patrols will search this entire area and keep in constant contact. The rest of the company are to follow this general plan. If I may, Captain, this region is full of fractures and crevices in the land. You can't see these on the map, by the map is only an approximation. There are large caves. The bandits know them well, and this terrain is ideal for set up an ambush. We don't know the land, our combing has very little chance of success. And there is no water. If you were commanding the company, what would you do? Maybe I'm mistaken, but I don't think that the bandits will be able to... ... stay in an area as barren as this for very long. And they wouldn't risk the lives of men. Those are the opinions of a Lieutenant, as far as I'm concerned I thought about this solution too but I rejected it immediately. The bandits could profit from our lack of action and attack other villages. And if it's up to someone to risk their lives... ... it's not up to the civilians, it's up to us. I'm sure we can all agree on this, no? None of us have ever been afraid to risk our lives, as long as we are of use. I had hoped to have the full backing of the men by this point. It doesn't matter, I can manage without. The food cart will be left behind. Every Bersagliere will leave his equipment... ... and replace it with rations, water and ammunition for 5 days. We depart at 04:00. Good evening Go, and good luck! - Third! - Be strong, and Keep your wits about. Company, attention! Wake up down there. Let's go, boys! - The patrols have moved out, Captain, Sir. - Off your go, Lieutenant, and good luck. Thank you, Captain, Sir! Present, arms! 95 men present. - Remove. - Remove! At ease! I sent for the Superintendent, why isn't he here? The Superintendent left an hour ago. Left?! Forward, march. Company, attention! Left flank, left! Right shoulder, arms! Forward! Fourth! Fourth! Fourth! Fifth! You answer, let me hear your voice. Sixth! - Sounds like a rooster. - I'm not a tenor, you know. Be quiet. They didn't hear us. Sixth! Let's try together, if they don't respond we'll need to inform the Captain. Sixth! - Who goes there? - Sampetta! - Any news? - The seventh patrol isn't responding to our signals. - Lieutenant! Have you heard any rifle fire? - No, Sir. Why aren't they following instructions? Did you hear that? The seventh patrol isn't responding. Who was in command? The seventh? Corporal Rovetta. Busacchi and Tavella were with him. Tell the patrol commanders to proceed on the assigned route. Yes, Sir! - But, Captain, Sir... - If the seventh platoon is lost, we shall find them. - There's no time to lose. Move the company forward. - Forward, march! This guy is terrible. Seventh! Seventh! Seventh! - Seventh! - Enough of that, for God's sake! Get up! Get up, you sack of porridge! Get up and walk before I whack you! - If you don't get up I'll kill you! - Calm down, Michele. Here, take a sip of water. Enough, do you want us to be without!? - Just let me fire off a round, they might hear it. - No, no and no! How can I make you understand? Are you looking to get spotted by bandits? And, since we definitely won't hear them calling like this, it's better if you shut up. A real corporal, you are! All you know is how to bully others and stuff yourself... ... not how to command a patrol. Now where are we going? The only thing we can do is keep moving forward. - You damned idiot! - No, take it easy! You're a damned idiot, alright. Look what you've made me do. - Let's go. - Leave me here. - It's my fault... I wasn't thinking. - Don't play the idiot, now. Come on. Who is in the house? Answer me! Hey, Busacchi! Pinin, check inside. - Where are you from? - From Piedmont. Do you know where that is? - No. It's the same the world over. What's your name? Do you want me to help you? I would never have believed that in this country there were blonde girls. - My name's Pinin. - Pinin? Come on, wake up! Get up, men! Quickly, quickly! Rucksacks on shoulders. Come on! - You too, Tubino. - I'm ill. Tell the medic that I'm ill. - Enough! - Is Pinin's patrol back yet? No, but we're going to look for them. Get up, get up! Come on, let's go! Forward, quickly! Men, forward march! Come on! - I'd like to see how far we get without a drop of water. - Quickly, quickly! What do they think we are, lambs for the slaughter? We're thirsty! - Water! - I can't go on! Wat... - Shut up and walk. Idiot. Who knows what's happened to the others and you're moaning about water. Why don't you peasants go and look for them? - Why should we risk our lives for them? - You disgust me, go to hell! Hey, water! Water, boys! Look, there's water! Look, Lieutenant! Company, attention! Present, arms! - Halt! - Where are you going? I must speak with your Captain. The rifle is mine. Go on. I bring you the head of Raffa Raffa. Tell your Piedmontese, I know where he is and how to get him. We need to leave right away, while the wolf is in his den. And if you bring your soldiers, tomorrow Raffa Raffa will breath his last breath. I swear to you on Saint Michael! Do you know how to read? Read this. It's confirmation that this man can be trusted, that we should follow him immediately. There's Superintendent Siceli's signature. Do you know his handwriting? No. - Who are you? Where are you from? - Where did you see the Superintendent? Come on, idiot, answer the Lieutenant! If you swear on your honour that you will not tell anyone... ... then I'll tell you who I am and why I want Raffa Raffa's head. Take it, a token of trust. Keep it. Sound the horns to march. You come with me. Sounds the horns. Let them know. Sound the horns! Forward! Forward, quickly! Come on, hurry up! In line, come on. Fall in. - Fall in ! Come on, come on! - Get in line! To your places. Fall in on the right. Come on boys, come on! - Ready, Sir. - At ease. Break ranks. Gather round. Boys, this man knows where Raffa Raffa and his gang are hiding. With a march of just three hours we can pounce on them. I know that you're dying of thirst, and that provisions are dwindling... ... that you can't go on... But we must go on! I ask you for one last effort, and I don't ask this for me. Three years out here, in a country now stained by the blood of our dead... ... men whose lives must be avenged... ... now the moment has arrived and I will not let it slip away. Fill your flasks with any clean water you can find. Share out any remaining provisions. They are to be divided equally. Get kitted up and then fall in. In half an hour we set off. But Captain, Sir, how can we trust this man so easily? His motives are believable, I believe he's telling the truth. Anyhow, to take such risks is part of our duty. - Go and prepare, we're moving out. - Come on, boys. Captain's orders. Come on, move yourselves. - Move it! Let's go, get yourselves ready. - Are you deaf? Go and prepare! - What do you think you're doing? - What's wrong with you? - Get up! - Get walking! - What are you doing? Did you not hear? - Come on, start walking! - Come on, wake up! - Get walking! Come on! - Get organise, come on! Go and prepare! - What are you doing there? Move! What's going on? Do they refuse to march? I don't think it's right for them to have to take on such a risky expedition... ... with the unit in such bad condition. - You think we could hold out here for another 12 hours? - Certainly. Find me 5 volunteers, I'll go and see what it is we're dealing with. You are to wait for me here for 12 hours. If this man is telling the truth... ... I will send you a rider and you are to move the company to my location. If we're dealing with a trap, or I haven't returned within 12 hours... ... you will take the company back to base and file a report detailing what has happened. What, you're not taking your soldiers with you? - 5 volunteers. - Me. - I will come with you, Captain, Sir. - Excellent. - Me too, Captain. But we need soldiers, Captain! I need three more. Come on, boys! Sound the horns! - Off you go, Lieutenant. - Let's go, boys. - Forward. You, too? Your stomach-ache has passed? - If there's the promise that this thing will be over soon, of course. - Well done, go. You lead the way. Okay, Lieutenant. If I'm not to return... My wife and children... Make sure you get this back to them. Goodbye. That's my brother. We can pass. Stop! The wolf is in his den. Hey! Hey, Captain, over here! Over here, Captain! Let's go. - Get down. - Stay low. - Oh, finally. - Superintendent... Come. Come, Captain. Stay hidden, Captain. Bandits. In this country the question of honour is serious matter. Since Raffa Raffa took his wife, he has plotted his revenge... ... he hasn't let Raffa Raffa from his sight, him and his brothers. There's no time to lose, Captain, here they're sitting ducks. Bring the company forward. Thank you, Superintendent... ... and please, accept my apologies. Me? - Heaven forbid, Captain. Do you think this is the time for that? - Yes. Please? Tonin, come here. Listen. Take off your rucksack. You need to run like a horse, as if you were back in your village running for sport. Find Lieutenant Magistrelli and come back here with the company. Yes, Captain, Sir. Should leave this as well, so that I can run faster? Yes, yes. Go, go! We're alone, Superintendent. The soldiers were worn out and didn't trust me. If Tonin reaches them, the company will be here within a couple of hours. Jesus. Get down, Lieutenant. Tonin is quick, I'm sure he made it. If the bandits discover us up here as well we won't be able to hold out for long. This is an excellent position. Lieutenant, spread the men out. Hide yourselves, and stay on the lookout. - How's your stomach feeling? - Good. - Well done. Keep it up! Look out! Come on, Dino. - Charge! - Forward! Raffa Raffa! Come on, you bastard! I've come to slaughter you! I throw my rifle down! Come on, you coward! And remember Zita Maria in hell! - Tancredi. - Present! - Colnaghi. - Present! Paolucci. - Passignana. - Present! - Marchetti. - Present! - Rovere. - Present! Martinelli. Martinelli. - Vastamino. - Present! Bordoni. Bordoni. - Baroncini. - Present! Put it back in his bag. - What should I do with the bag? - Put it with the others. So that someone, one day, will know all of the the Bersaglieri who gave their lives today. Yes, Captain, Sir. - Lieutenant Righi's effects are in his case. - Okay. Lieutenant Magistrelli needs you, there's a wounded man who wants to speak with you. A bandit. Please, bury me in a separate grave. Not in contempt of the others... ... but because my mother will want to come and... find me. Of course, Lieutenant. You have done your duty. I have done mine. Good luck to you... ... and to all of Italy. Hey, here they are, they're here! Carmine! Where's Carmine? Coscritto! Hey, Carmine ! Coscritto! Coscritto! Carmine ! - Carmine ! - Carmine, your wife is here! - You've avenged her! - Carmine. Go, Carmine, she's waiting for you. You can go. Go. I was sure you were dead. - Hip, hip, hooray! - Hip, hip, hooray! Company, attention! Present, arms! 75 present, 19 wounded, 13 dead. At the ready! At the ready! Remove! Right flank, right! Company! Forward, march!
