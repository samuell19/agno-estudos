It's a typical day in Dogpatch, U.S.A. Where typical folks Do things in a typical way First, we rub the sleep From our eyes Get our grub And shoo away the flies We spend what's negotiable Then we get sociable Sitting around swapping lies And then we drops by To collect unemployment pay Which leads us to say It's a typical day in Dogpatch, U.S.A. Howdy, boys I'm Moonbeam McSwine Sleepin' out with pigs is my line The fellas admire me But they don't squire me Unless the weather is fine But I does all right when the wind Blows the other way I is known as Marryin' Sam Which is fine Because that's who I am I figures it's vital To change a gal's title To missus or even madame For 15 cents extra I'll furnish the bride's bouquet Step aside for Earthquake McGoon Bustin' out all over like June I stands on the corner Enormous and ornery Makin' the fairer sex swoon My secret desire is to tangle with Daisy Mae. Like he said My name's Daisy Mae Because my ma She planned it that way My one aim in life Is to be a good wife And to marry Li'l Abner someday She'd chase Li'l Abner Clear off into outer space If he could be caught In the next Sadie Hawkins Race Mammy here's society's queen And she heads the local machine I's sweet, but I's mystical And pugilistical Matter of fact, a champion Li'l Abner We has both learned Still don't know How money gets earned He's big, and he's gentle But unsentimental As far as young gals is concerned I get purty tired Of runnin' from Daisy Mae Which leads us to say It's a typical day in Dogpatch, U.S.A. - Girls, Sadie Hawkins Day. - Oh, boy. I'm gonna catch myself a husband this year. Look, here comes Marryin' Sam. - Good old Dogpatch. Nice to be back. - Hi, Marryin' Sam. Greetings, everybody. Greetings to y'all. - Hi there. - Hi, Marryin' Sam! - Hi, Sam Howdy, Marryin' Sam. Welcome home. Well, it sure is nice to see all you gals getting in shape - for the big race next Friday. - We sure is, Sam. Has you any new types of weddings for us this year, Sam? No, honey, just my usual line. There's my $2 standard, which guarantees you three weeks of bliss and 50 years of quiet desperation. My $4 special. My $6 foreign sports model. That's in case any of you latches on to some foreign sports. And of course, my $8 spectacular. And don't you worry about your credit, because this year I'm on the Diners Club. Now we'll see you next Friday, Sam, with our newly intended, whoever they may be. - Grab yourself a live one, Moonbeam. - We sure will, Sam. See you. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten... Come on, Sophia. Let's go see our friend Available Jones. Well, howdy, Sam. Welcome home. Howdy, Available. My, sure is good to see you, and it's good to be back here in a metropolis. - I guess that's where I belong. - You always was a city boy at heart. Yeah. I likes the hustle and the bustle and... Say, what you working on? Greatest piece of merchandise I ever had for the Sadie Hawkins Day Race. It's my ICBM. ICBM? What's that mean? "I catches bachelor men." Sounds promising. - How does it work? - Top-secret. Already been promised to a matriarchal head of one of Dogpatch's first families. - Not Pansy Yokum? - No comment. Now, don't tell me that Mammy's fixing to trap Li'l Abner so as Daisy Mae can catch him this year? Can't discuss it. - Why not? - You knows my integrity, my sense of honor. When I makes a confidential deal for a price, my lips is sealed, and they stay sealed. - Till you gets a better price. - Naturally. Marryin' Sam. Marryin' Sam. What is it, Louella? Mammy Yokum says for you to come right on over for a business conference of enormous magnitude. I'll be right there, child. Oh, by the way, - how's your dear mother? - She's out a-hunting. - And your dear father? - That's what she's a-hunting for. Lovely child. Think there's a chance we could marry her off this year? Sure is, soon as her divorce is final. Keep me informed. Abner, it's time to go fishing. I'm coming. You can't go yet. - Why not? - Because you can't, that's why. Pansy, if the boy wants to go fishing-- Hush up. You can't go yet. - Why not? - Because... Because you haven't taken your Yokumberry Tonic. Mammy, I'm too old to still take that old baby tonic. - Oh, no, you ain't. - Oh, yes, l is. Oh, no, you ain't, and I knows best. I've been giving you a spoonful of my own special Yokumberry Tonic every day since the day you was born. And I intends to give you a spoonful every day till the day you dies and for several weeks thereafter. Now open and hold. - But, Mammy, I've got-- - Open and hold. I has spoken. - Hey, Abner, come on. - I'm coming. Abner Yokum, you sit that down right there. That there. Oh, Mammy. Now, Abner, Daisy Mae is coming by soon, so is Marryin' Sam. And I kind of thought that maybe this year you'd let that sweet little gal catch you on Sadie Hawkins Day. Pansy, if the boy feels he ain't ready for marriage yet-- Pappy, why don't you take your oversized nose and your undersized self and take a walk. - Now, Pansy-- - Goon. Stroll into town, see what's doing down in the lower-rent district. Go on, get. - But, Pansy-- - Get! I has spoken. One of these days, you're gonna make me very mad. Get, get, get out of my way. I got places to go and things to do. Now, son-- Mammy, before you get started, I've got something to say. You is my very own mother. Down deep inside of me, I loves and respects you, almost as much as I loves and respects the U.S. of A. But I also want to say that down deep inside of me, I loves and respects fishing, and that's where I'm going now. - But, Abner, I-- - See you later, Mammy. Abner, I'm... Now, you wait right here for me, Sophia, and don't you go chomping on any of them Yokumberries. - Well, howdy, Sam. - Why, howdy, Pansy Yokum. Sure is nice to see your Yokumberry tree blooming so high and happy. Does pretty well every year, Sam. Thank you. Yes. And how is your sweet, gentle and relentless little self? Tolerable, Sam. Tolerable. But I has to have a man-to-man talk with you. Summit conference? The summitest. Sit down, Sam. Tell me, Sam, what you got this year in a $2 wedding? My $2 wedding? This year, it is spectacular. First, I strips to the waist and wrestles the four biggest guests, male or female. That's a nice warm beginning. Then I tells four or five off-color stories, guaranteed to embarrass man or beast. And as I ties my arms and legs to four infuriated mules-- Mammy, Mammy Yokum. Mammy. Mammy, look at this. - Oh, hello, Marryin' Sam. - Morning, Daisy. And how is your sweet and well-proportioned little self? Miserable, Sam. Look what I just received, a wedding invite. Well, what's so miserable about that? It's an invite to my own wedding. - What? - Listen to this. "Dear madam, you is hereby cordially invited to attend the nuptials of your own, sweet, well-put-together self and that ever-popular, champion dirty wrestler of the world, namely me, Earthquake McGoon." - Earthquake McGoon? - Earthquake McGoon? - "Dinner. R.S.V.P." - What's that mean? When you has dinner with Earthquake McGoon, R.S.V.P. means only one thing, “roast skunk very possible." Mammy, I'm scared. I never said I'd "nuptialize” with a miserable ape like Earthquake McGoon. Did I hear my name? Morning, ladies. Howdy, Sam. My, Daisy Mae, you looking special purty this morning. Thank you, Mr. McGoon. Glad I ran into you, Sam. Tell me, what has you in a $4 wedding? And just what, may I ask, would a rat varmint like you want with information about a $4 wedding? Could be I'm fixing to get myself married, since just returning home with my newly acquired title, namely the World's Dirtiest Wrestler, I am particularly well-heeled. Is you inferring you has money? Lady, I is filthy with it. Mister, you was filthy without it. Naturally, I intend to wed a certain Dogpatch gal. McGoon, you crazy or something? You knows a man can't claim a gal for marriage down here unless she catches him herself on Sadie Hawkins Day. If you want some answers, I suggest you perambulates on down to the fall-about meeting, which is about to be held at Cornpone Square. Cornpone Square! You mean this is gonna be a Cornpone meeting? By direct request of my very good friend the Honorable Senator Jack S. Phogbound. - Is Senator Phogbound coming here? - That's right. - First time in 18 years. - This could be serious. And we only has Cornpone meetings for events of national importance. Or a hideous change in the Dogpatch way of life. There gonna be a hideous change, all right. Come on, Sam. Now, tell me about your $8 wedding. Well, I don't crave your business, but I can't discriminate. Now, first I clips your toenails, gives you a quick shave and a sponge bath if you needs it, and frankly, I'd say you needs it. I like that for a beginning. Looks bad, Daisy. Oh, what is we gonna do? I tell you what we's gonna do. You hightail it up to Polecat Creek and tell Abner and the rest of them no-good skunks - to get over there to that meeting. - Right. But what if they'd druther not? You just tell them that I'd druther they had druther, and when Pansy Yokum says she had druther they had druther. Brother, they'd druther. If I had my druthers I'd druther have my druthers Than do any work at all It ain't that I hates it I often contemplates it While watching the raindrops fall I sits there for hours Developin' my powers Of figurin' how flowers gets tall If I had my druthers I'd druther have my druthers Than do any work at all Abner? Oh, there you are. Abner. Abner, Mammy says y'all is to come to the meeting. - Daisy Mae, you is out of bounds. - Abner, you-- You know Polecat Creek is off-limits to love-starved females. - I'm no-- - And since you is both love-starved and female, I suggest you get out the way you got in. Abner Yokum, if you don't get down to that meeting, Mammy gonna give you what for. What for is she gonna give me what for? Because it's a big, important meeting, big enough so that Earthquake McGoon's going around bragging how he's gonna marry me and throw me a big fancy wedding with a roast-skunk dinner. That's just talk. He can't marry you unless you catches him first on Sadie Hawkins Day. And you don't run after nobody but me. You does it every year, you poor soul. This year it'd be so simple if you'd just help me. I mean, if you is ashamed, I could dig a big hole, and you could fall in and pretend like you broke your leg. Or maybe I could shoot you in some unimportant place. Daisy Mae, that is subversive talk, and I won't hear none of it. And neither will these boys. Now you get on out of here. - But, Abner-- - I said, get. - But Mammy said-- - Get, I has spoken. All right, I'll just tell Mammy you ain't coming to the Cornpone meeting. - Cornpone meeting? - Of course. You didn't say it was a Cornpone meeting. Did you hear that, fellas? A Cornpone meeting. This must be a national emergency. We'd better get there fast, this might call for some brains or something. - Daisy, fetch me my worms. - Surely. Mayor Dawgmeat! Times a-wasting, so let's get on with the meeting. Yeah, mayor, lay it on them, lay it on them. Fellow citizens, I, My Honor, Daniel D. Dawgmeat, declares open this solemn Jubilation T. Cornpone meeting. That's fine, I'm sure glad to hear that. - Who was Jubilation T. Cornpone? - Hush up. - Hush up, I said. - Now wait a minute, Rufe. Don't whomp that child. Come here, Zsa Zsa. Zsa Zsa, honey, it's high time you knew that our town was founded by that beloved man sitting up there on that beloved horse, Jubilation T. Cornpone. The greatest fighting general and military strategist the Confederacy ever knew. Was he brave? Brave? Why J.T. Cornpone didn't know the meaning of the word "fear.” Terror, yes, but fear, never. And all over the countryside, there's monuments commemorating the names of his famous battles. - Such as? - Cornpone's Disaster. Cornpone's Misjudgment. Cornpone's Catastrophe. And Cornpone's Humiliation. When we fought the Yankees And annihilation was near Who was there to lead the charge That took us safe to the rear? Why, it was Jubilation T. Cornpone Old Toot-Your-Own-Horn-pone Jubilation T. Cornpone A man who knew no fear - Tell us more, Sam. - Yeah, tell us. What else did he do? When we almost had them But the issue still was in doubt Who suggested the retreat That turned it into a rout? Why, it was-- - Jubilation T. Cornpone. - Correct! Old Tattered-and-Torn-pone Jubilation T. Cornpone He kept us hidin' out With our ammunition gone And faced with utter defeat Who was it that burned the crops And left us nothing to eat? Why, it was Jubilation T. Cornpone Old September-Morn-pone Jubilation T. Cornpone The pants blown off his seat Hooray! When it seemed like our brave boys Might keep on fighting for months Do tell! Who took pity on them And capitulated at once? Why, it was Jubilation T. Cornpone Unshaven-and-Shorn-pone Jubilation T. Cornpone He weren't nobody's dunce Why, it was Jubilation T. Cornpone Unshaven-and-Shorn-pone Jubilation T. Cornpone He weren't nobody's dunce History says that General Grant Was pretty good with a jug Who drank drink-for-drink with him And wound up under the rug? Why, it was Jubilation T. Cornpone Passed-Out-Until-Morn-pone Jubilation T. Cornpone His whiskers in his mug Hearing that a Northern spy Had come to town for a night Who gained entrance to her rooms And lost a glorious fight? Why, it was Jubilation T. Cornpone Old-Weary-and-Worn-pone Jubilation T. Cornpone He fought all through the night There at Appomattox, Lee and Grant Were present, of course As Lee swept a tear away Who swept up back of his horse? Why, it was Jubilation T. Cornpone Weren't-Sorry-Forlorn-pone Jubilation T. Cornpone A picture of remorse Why, it was Jubilation T. Cornpone Completely-Abhorrent-pone Jubilation T. Cornpone He really saved the day All right, mayor, now get on to your agenda. Yeah, let's do a little "agendizing." All right, let's get back to the meeting. - Now, the first thing on the agenda is-- - Hold it! Hold it a minute! Mayor Dawgmeat, I've got a question. I wanna knows how come we having a Cornpone meeting. Abner, my boy, the answer to that is a-coming up the road right now. Hello, everybody! Hello! Hello, glad to see you. Well, now, say-- Hello. Yes. Earthquake, how are you, my boy? Howdy, senator. - Abner, get back here. - Hello, senator. Well, Daisy Mae. My fellow citizens of Dogpatch, our distinguished senator, the Honorable Jack S. Phogbound. Mayor Dawgmeat and my beloved constituents of Dogpatch, I could stand here and bask in the sunshine of your warm greeting forever. Bask on your own time, Phogbound. Yeah, get to the point! Get to the point! Now, I bet you all wonder what I've been doing down in Washington these last 18 years. We didn't care just so long as you was there and we was here. Quiet! Senator, tell them what you done done for us down there in Washington. I done got the United States Senate to pass the Jack S. Phogbound Bill. There's no Jack S. like our Jack S. That's right. Through my efforts, little old Dogpatch, obscure, unknown, poverty-stricken Dogpatch is gonna be world-famous. And just what for is we gonna be famous for? What for? You is gonna save the lifeblood of a vigorous, thriving American industry, that's what for. And what industry is that, senator? My boy, a glorious young industry devoted solely to the stimulation and relaxation so necessary for the American businessman. An industry known as Las Vegas. Las Vegas? Ain't that where they do all that gambling? Yes, Daisy Mae, and right there's their problem. You see, in the desert nearby, the government's a-shooting off certain nuclear weapons of war. Atom bombs. Atom bombs! That's right, and atomic dust of them bombs is a-floating down and a-settling in them Las Vegas swimming pools and on them beautiful, green felt crap-shooting tables. That green felt is a-turning so brown, you can't tell at all whether your money is playing the field - or coming the hard way. - Well, I object. And the colors is fading on them slot machines. - No. - Oh, yes, they is. Why, you can't tell at all whether you've got two cherries or three plums, three bells or two oranges. And when you hits the jackpot, you don't dare touch your money, because it might be radioactive. Does you think your government up there in Washington is gonna stand by and let a tragedy like this happen to an American industry to whom so many have given so much for so little? - No! - No, my-- No, my friends. And that is why the Jack S. Phogbound Committee has been chosen. To find a new place to test them atom bombs and guided missiles? Yes. Some place we can blow off the face of the earth. Some spot that ain't never gonna be missed. In fact, the most unnecessary place in the whole U.S.A. Well, I'll be dogged. How about that. And I now has the honor and the privilege of announcing that, after a four-year government survey of all the no-good, no-account, unnecessary places in this whole country, you has been selected as the most unnecessary of all. Now pay attention, you lovable citizens. You all is gonna be moved out of here by order of the United States government. And here's the fine government scientist who will supervise your evacuation. Citizens, meet Dr. Rasmussen T. Finsdale. Friends, friends, we intend to move you from Dogpatch to a necessary place in our society. Now, the first detonation will be on Wednesday, but the evacuation will start immediately. So good luck and thank you. And so, my dear constituents, as I bid you farewell, I beg you, don't let me down. Just remember, your government is spending $1 million on one bomb just to blow your homes off the face of the earth. So show your appreciation! Don't that take the rag Off of the bush? Sure do! Don't that take the tassel Off of the corn? Yahoo! Of all the very ordinary Most unloved Unnecessary places on this earth They settled on yours - Rule the day! - They settled on yours - Great day! - As sure as you're born - Hey! Hey! - They settled on yours Dogpatch! Don't that take the beard Off of the goat? Don't that take the nap Off of the yarn? Of all the very ordinary Most unloved Unnecessary places on this earth The favorite is ours Don't that take the rag Off of the bush? Don't that take the tassel Off of the corn? Of all the very ordinary Most unloved Unnecessary places on this earth The favorite is ours Dogpatch! Hold it! Wait up! Friends, citizens, wash out your ears and listen close. I wants to add to this glorifying occasion by making a history-creating, romantic announcement. I hereby claims as my bride in marriage none other than that attractive little crowd-pleaser, the ever-popular Miss Daisy Mae. - Holy mackerel. - How dare you! - Abner, give him what for. - I'll bust his head wide open. Just a minute. I does the head-busting for this family. McGoon, you crazy? You know you can't claim no gal down here unless she catches you on Sadie Hawkins Day. You hear the man? He say they gonna drop the bomb on Wednesday. Well, Sadie Hawkins Day ain't till Friday. So there can't be no more Sadie Hawkins Day. No more Sadie Hawkins Day? What is we gonna do? Mammy, what is we gonna do? Think fast, Mammy. My income depends on the outcome. - Don't worry, Sam. - Be quiet, everybody. Since we ain't gonna have no more Sadie Hawkins Day, we automatically goes back to the code of the hills. Whereby, if a male desires marriage with a female of the opposite sex, he can claim his beloved if he gets approval of her next of kin. - Right, Mayor Dawgmeat? - That's the law. Therefore, I claims in marriage the aforementioned lusciously desirable, delicious, delectable, palpitatingly appetizing young morsel-- Is that a female or a breakfast food? Hush up. Miss Daisy Mae. Under the code of the hills, is there any other claimers? - Excuse me. - Naturally. Much obliged. Well, if there isn't any other claimers, - I's award Daisy-- - Wait! I also claims the ever-popular lady in question. - You done what? - I claims Daisy Mae. For the purposes of marriage? Well, whatever he's claiming her for, I'm claiming her for. Abner, does you really mean it? Sure, I means it. Oh, Abner, dear. All right. We has two claimers. Now, under the aforesaid code of the hills, whereas there's two claimers, the choice must be decided on by Daisy Mae's next of kin. - Been decided. - What? She already been promised to me by my good friend, and Daisy Mae's closest next of kin, the ever-sensible Romeo Scragg. Romeo Scragg? That's me. Big and brassy, fat and sassy, fit as a fiddle and ready for love. Romeo Scragg, you claims you Daisy Mae's kith and kin? - I is, and that's the whole trouble. - Trouble? I'd like to kith her, but I don't think I kin. Quiet now. Now, Daisy Mae, is Romeo Scragg your kinfolk, or ain't he? Well, yes, but they from a disgusting side of the family we never socializes with except for weddings and hangings, mostly theirs. Ain't no use you fighting it, honey child. You're pure Scragg from the top of your scraggy head to the bottom of your scraggy toes, and that's a mess of Scragg. But we don't consider ourselves-- Once a Scragg, always a Scragg. Quiet. Quiet. Now, Romeo Scragg, is it true that you gave Daisy Mae - to Earthquake McGoon? - Correct. How could you make such a miserable decision? Because Earthquake here, he's a fine man. He's a good man. He put love in his heart, he put faith in his country, and he just put $4 in my back pocket. Bless you, my children. That'll be $4 more. Let me at him! Let me at him! Didn't I shoot you last week? - Did you hear what he said to me? - Quiet, everybody. Now, let's get on with the plans for the evacuation. Just a minute. I have something to say. Now, I has been promised to Earthquake McGoon to have and to hold. I know some great holds. And I'll go through with the nuptials fair and square because we lives by the code of the hills, which I loves and respects. But first I wanna ask a question. Is there a government man here? Excuse me. Yes, miss, what is it? Were you gonna bomb our town because you couldn't find - nothing about it necessary, right? - Correct. Suppose we did find something necessary, - what then? - Well, we'd hardly bomb any community which made a necessary contribution to society. You all hear that? Now, I say, let's go spread out and find something necessary. She's right. We gotta save our Sadie Hawkins Day, gals. - Protect the rights of womanhood. - You can't stop your fellow citizens. They wants to get up and get out of here. These fine young maidens got a right to get out of this miserable pesthole and go see the outside world. - Yeah, Mammy. - We wants to get citified. - "Culturized.” - Modernized. We wants to broaden our horizons. So you does, does you? Well, let me tell you something. Your horizons are broad enough already. Especially yours. You gals got any idea what they got waiting for you out there? - The horrible, miserable customs? - Like what? Like a before-marriage custom called "engagement.” Engagement? What's that? That's the time that elapses between when a gal says, "Sure do," and the preacher says, "Go to." How long does that engagement thing last? - Sometimes a whole month. - A whole month? What are they, insecure? Yes, my good friends, you're gonna have to do all kinds of horrible things out there. - Gonna have to take baths. - No. - Comb your hair. - No! - Clean your nails. - No! And worst of all, you'll have to go to work. No! - Oh, that's terrible. - Is we gonna stand for this injustice? - No! - Is we gonna take this lying down? - No! - Then what's we gonna do? I'll tell you what we's gonna do. We gonna turn this whole town upside down until some place, somewhere, someone finds something necessary. Abner, help me. Come on, Daisy. Abner, let's stop and talk for a while. This ain't no time to do any talking. But, Abner, don't you realize what you've just done? - You've finally asked me to marry you. - Yeah, I know. Why did you do it? Well, I don't know. I just did, that's all. But why? Well, there you was, your usual sweet self, and there was old Earthquake, a-panting, a-puffing, a-wheezing and a-snorting at you. I ain't gonna let no one like McGoon puff, pant, wheeze and snort at you. So I just ups and done it, that's all. Does that mean you aims to let me catch you if we has Sadie Hawkins? - I reckon so. - Oh, Abner. - What took you so long? - Well, I don't know, Daisy. Some years, I wanted you to catch me awful bad, but I just couldn't. I don't know why I couldn't, but I couldn't. - There must've been a reason. - But what was it? Take last year's race for instance. There I was, loping along with my usual burst of brilliant speed, and I turned around and seen you, sweet and purty, reaching out your hand to grab me for life. And suddenly, a voice inside of me hollered, "Abner, boy, take off!" And I took. Oh, but that's all behind us now. You really reckon? And life's gonna be full of so many wonderful things. Things you've been deserving for such a long, long time. Namely what? You deserves a gal who's willing Namely me One who'd love To have your children Namely me Standing there In the doorway waiting At the close of day With you all the way To love Honor and obey You deserves two arms to hold you Namely mine There to comfort and enfold you Rain or shine I deserve someone Strong and handsome Bashful and shy and true And I know Just the one who'll do Namely you You deserve someone good-looking Namely me Someone who as yet ain't tooken Namely me That is how I'll remain Unless you get me Shall we say In the family way Come next Sadie Hawkins Day You craves arms To make you tingle Namely mine To a bachelor who's single That sounds fine Comes the day I no longer "bachel” Naturally, I'll be true - And who could I - And who could I - Be truest to? - Be truest to? Namely you Abner, don't stand there mooning and spooning! Come on, we gotta get down and help save the town! I'm sorry. It just won't do. There's nothing indispensable about any of this. Here's something necessary. Yeah, what about this, Mr. Government-Man? Oh, no. There's absolutely nothing necessary about a cigar-store Indian, or a set of his and her spittoons, or any of this trash. - Is there anyone else? - I've got it! I've got it! - Here it is. - What is it? A 1925 Sears, Roebuck catalog. Special Dogpatch edition. But there's no printing in it. The pages are all blank. Well, we didn't have any money that year, so they sent it out blank just to keep up the goodwill. Well, it's interesting, my good man, but hardly a necessity. Might be if you lived in Dogpatch. Now I've had enough. This is an order. Every one of you-- I's got it. I's got it. You can stop your fretting and your fussing because I's really got it. The most necessary innovation in modern times. - Oh, quickly, what is it? - Here, put these on. Cover up, young feller. Stupefyin'... ...Jones. What does it do? It's a deadly weapon, guaranteed to stupefy any human male dead in his tracks. Here, I'll demonstrate. Hey, Itchy McRabbit. - Yeah. - Come on over here. All right, honey. Five, four, three, two, blast off. Stupefied. Unstupefied. - What you want? - Nothing. Oh, all right. - Well? - It's fascinating. But of what utility? Why, she'd be invaluable to music lovers. She could make Elvis Presley stand still. But I like him the way he is. Now, then, enough of this nonsense. The-- I've got it. I've got it. I've really got it. If you's looking for something necessary to the whole country, look no more, because I has it right here in this little bottle. My own special Yokumberry Tonic. - Yokumberry Tonic? - Yep. I whops it out of the berries of my Yokumberry tree. Madam, I never heard of a Yokumberry tree. Well, you wouldn't. There's only one of them in the whole world. That's right, and it's right in their front yard. - That's the truth. - Man ain't interested in your phony old tonic. Phony? My boy, Abner, takes it, and just look at those muscles. Yeah, just look at those muscles. And look at that smile. Wall-to-wall teeth. I'm sorry, madam. We already have more tonics and bodybuilders than we can use. Appears to me, your body could still do with a little more building. Now, that's enough. The evacuation will proceed immediately. Meaning there's just nothing about us that's necessary? I'm afraid not. And I should think you'd be delighted at a chance to get out of a place like this. You don't rightly understand, mister. It may not look like much to you, but this here's our land, our soul. Where we was raised. And where our kinfolk was born and hung. Where our ancestors took their bare hands and built all of this out of the wilderness. Our beautiful skunk works. West Pork Chop Railroad. That beautiful intersection of Hog Fat Boulevard and Sheep Dip Drive. Where we was planning to build our new hotel, the Dogpatch Hilton. Not to mention, Cornpone Square. Come on Mammy, Pappy. If you're looking for something really necessary, we got them. - Now what? - Kikapoo joy juice. Heap big firewater. Cheap rotgut, ain't fit for human consumption. Now, wait, wait. Can it be produced inexpensively? Mister, if you pays more than a nickel a quart, you're violating the fair-trade laws. Well, there we are. An alcoholic beverage that could be sold to the American public for only 5 cents a quart. Perhaps I'd better taste it. No need to bother, doctor. I'd be glad to take a little taste for you. Oh, very well, if you'd like. Water! Water! Water! Why bother with just plain water? Why not take something guaranteed to build you up, like some Yokumberry Tonic. - He's as big as Li'l Abner. - He is. He is. Holy mackerel. He sure is. What was in that bottle? Just some of my own special bodybuilding tonic. Has anyone ever taken this before? No one in the whole world except my boy, Abner. You say this tonic is made from a tree that grows only in your front yard? That's right, and it belongs to my boy, Abner. Dr. Finsdale, this is a matter for top echelon security. Right. Yokum, you'll have to come to Washington immediately. - Yes, sir, Your Honor. - Now hear this, all of you. This Yokumberry Tonic seems to have miracle-like properties, which could well alter our plan for the evacuation of Dogpatch. - Hooray! - Hooray! However, this drug will need exhaustive tests on human guinea pigs, and since you will be most affected by its outcome, I'm asking, are there any volunteers among you? Hey, hey, you got one right here. If he gonna come out looking anything like Abner, you got yourself one guinea pig. If that stuff will make something like that out of something like this, you got him. I'd be happy if mine had a pair of shoulders like that. I'd be happy if mine had one shoulder like that. - Take him. - Take them all. Marryin' Sam. Sam. - What is it, child? - Go along with him, Sam. - Take care of Li'l Abner. - Be my pleasure, honey. Gentlemen, you'll find an Army truck waiting down the road. Come along. Hold on. Wait a minute. Mr. Scientist, does this mean we're gonna be necessary after all? My dear young lady, if these tests fulfill their promise, Dogpatch will not only become necessary, it will become absolutely indispensable. Hooray! The world was shaken to its roots today by a White House announcement that a Dogpatch lad named Abner Yokum has discovered a miracle drug which may revolutionize mankind. We got it first. Bulletin, the White House, Washington, D.C. Abner Yokum has just told the president that if the Yokumberry tests are successful, he will give all rights of his fabulous drug to the government itself. Private industry is up in arms. Phogbound, you idiot. Phogbound, you bumbling nincompoop. Didn't you tell Yokum of my offer of a million dollars for the rights to manufacture that drug? I did, General Bullmoose, but he says he's only interested in what's good for the U.S.A. What's good for General Bullmoose is what's good for the U.S.A. And by Dow Jones and all their little averages, don't you forget it. - Right, boys? - Right! Three rousing rahs a few hazzahs And a hip, hip, hip hooray What's good for General Bullmoose Is good for the U.S.A. Phogbound, I want the manufacturing rights to that drug. And by E.R. Squibb & Sons, I don't care how I get it. What's this nonsense about his wanting to give it away? That's right. He's gonna give it to the government. Didn't you tell him I can make him a better deal than the government? I have more money and fewer dependents. But, my dear General Bullmoose-- Don't you "dear General Bullmoose" me, you bumbling, incompetent hillbilly. Do you realize what you've done? If I owned that tonic, I could make all the money in the world. And I need it. Ever since I was a little child, I had a dream. A simple child's dream. And all that simple child ever wanted was to get his hands on all the money in the world before the greatest broker of them all called him to that big stock market in the sky. And you, you imbecile, you've shattered a little child's dream. Bullsie. Bullsie, sweetie, lower your voice. You know what the doctor said. You mustn't get so excited, you'll lower your blood sugar. I don't have blood sugar anymore. I sold it to my Cuban interest. Oh, Bullsie. Appassionata, you should've been here an hour ago. - Why are you so late? - I had to make up. - Your face? - No, with the chauffer. We had a little fight. Remind me to fire that chauffer. Now, Appassionata, that Yokum yokel is coming here today. He wants to give his drug to the government. And we've got to make him a better proposition. Now, let's see. What could we possibly offer him that he couldn't get from the government? Make sure I fire that chauffer. Now, Appassionata, listen carefully. You've got to do everything you can to help. If this bumpkin gives his drug to the government, he threatens the whole free-enterprise system. - What's in it for me? - This could destroy capitalism. - What's in it for me? - You've got to think of yourself as a super patriot doing a super patriotic duty. What's in it for me? A million bucks. Call me Betsy Ross. Mr. Yokum to see you, sir. Send him in. Send him in. Keep your motor running, Appassionata. I may need you. Come in, please. Just Mr. Yokum. Much obliged. Well, well, well. My boy. My dear boy. - I'm General Bullmoose, son. - Howdy, general. - You know the senator. - Oh, sure. And this is Miss Appassionata Von Climax, my executive secretary. Howdy, ma'am. Executive secretary? What does that mean, Your Honor? Well, she... Well, she works here. She gets a salary, and she kind of lives in my house. Oh, does that mean you gets bed and board, ma'am? Extremely. Mighty pleased to meet you, ma'am. Well, I'm mighty pleased to meet you too, Mr. Yokum. Mighty purty fur, ma'am. Did you shoot it? No, I kind of trapped it. Did you use any special bait? Just inhaling and exhaling. Yes, she's a very healthy girl. Yokum, my boy, it's time you and I had a little business talk. Now, I'm offering you a million dollars in cash for the rights to your drug. But I already told the president... - President? What president? - President of the United States. Oh, that president. Yokum, I don't think you comprehend what this elixir of yours can do. It stopped them from bombing my hometown, and that's all I cares about. Idealistic nonsense. Yokum, I have access to top-secret government reports, and so far, the tests show this drug of yours exceeds the most fantastic discoveries of science. - Is that good? - Good? Why, it'll give every male a perfect physique. Makes fat men thin, thin men fat. Takes hair from where you don't want, puts it where it counts. Broadens your shoulders, narrows your hips. Builds up your corpuscles, lowers blood pressure. Wakes you up in the morning, puts you to sleep at night. It softens your beard, toughens your skin, and what is more, it cleans your teeth and leaves your breath alone. Sure got good manners, don't it? Yokum, say the word, and we're ready to go into production. We'll bottle it. - We'll name it after you. - Me? We'll call it Yoka-Cola. Yoka-Cola. Son, we'll make billions, and for a starter, here's my check for a million dollars. Well, thanks, general. But if you don't mind, as a 100-percent red-blooded American, I'd rather give it to the United States government. - Government? - Yes, sir. Now if you'll excuse me, I gotta catch my bus home. They're running Sadie Hawkins Day tomorrow, and this year I just can't miss it. I guess you knows why, Mr. Senator. Well, bye, Mr. General, Miss Executive, senator. But, my boy, you can't walk out on a million dollars. - Why not? - Well, because-- Well, it just isn't thrifty. Well, maybe so, general, but I've always been kind of sporty with money. Bye, y'all. - Oh, Mr. Yokum. - Yes'm? - I do wish you'd stay. - Well, I have to catch a bus. - I'm sure you'd find it amusing. - It's-- I could show you around the city, or maybe we could even go to the country and do a little hunting. Well, I have a Sadie Hawk-- Could we hunt skunk? You do your skunk hunting in Dogpatch. Howdy do, ma'am? Oh, general, you better fire that chauffer. How do you like that? Well, I'm not through. Not yet. There's a billion dollars in that drug, and I'm not selling short. Not by all the barest bulls of all the bears and bulls on Broad Street. Phogbound, what's this Sadie Hawkins Day? Oh, a monstrous Dogpatch custom, wherein the gals chases the men and marries whomsoever they catches. Can an outsider enter? Sure can. Then we got him. We go to Dogpatch. Appassionata enters the Sadie Hawkins Day Race. She runs the race, she catches Abner Yokum, she marries Abner Yokum. And by community property, she owns half of everything he owns. Specifically, Yokumberry Tonic. Then, if some unfortunate accident should befall the poor fool, you, his young widow, would be the sole possessor of the entire drug. But, Bullsie, what if I don't catch him? I never run anymore. You'll run this time, or you'll be back wiping windshields at the five-minute car wash. But, Bullsie! Don't "Bullsie"” me. Pack your things, Appassionata. We're heading south. We'll show these hillbillies what's what. Right, boys? Right! He makes the rules And he intends to keep it thataway What's good for General Bullmoose Is good for the U.S.A. He finished up Like he begun it He went to Washington To win a fight and won it Li'l Abner seen his duty And he done it And he's necessary now Abner Yokum, we want you to know that we are all very proud of you. We wanna thank you for saving our town. It weren't hardly nothing. Hey, how's our guinea-pig husbands doing up there in Washington? Just fine. They're all turning into handsome, good-looking men. Good-looking as you Abner? Purty close. Well, tell us about Washington, son. Is it run by a bunch of crooks? No, sir, Pappy. And Washington's a right purty town. Why, everything's made out of big old white marble, and you can't hardly spit without you hitting a national shrine. Right, Sam? I ought to know because I let go a chaw of tobacco in a strong wind. It ricocheted around the Washington Monument, flew past Abe Lincoln and come to rest on Jefferson's dome. Thank heaven it didn't hit none of the Confederacy. Sam got a $5 fine. They got a law up there says you can't deface a national shrine. Well, never mind about defacing no national shrine, son. Tell us about the government. All them crooks. Well, there ain't no crooks up there, Pappy. Far as I could see, there's a very nice mess of people. And I can tell you all this much, the country's doing just fine. Right, Sam? You are so right, boy. Them city folks and we'uns Are purty much alike Though they ain't used To living in the sticks We don't like stone or cement But we is in agreement When we gets down To talking politics The country's in The very best of hands The best of hands The best of hands The Treasury says the national debt Is climbing to the sky And government expenditures Have never been so high It makes a feller get a gleam Of pride within his eye To see how our economy expands The country's In the very best of hands The country's In the very best of hands The best of hands The best of hands The farm bill should be 89 percent Of parity Another feller recommends It should be 93 But 80, 95 percent Who cares about degree? It's parity that no one understands The country's In the very best of hands Us voters is connected to the nominee The nominee's connected To the Treasury When he ain't connected To the Treasury He sits around on his thighbone They sits around In this place they got This big congressional parking lot Just sits around On their you know what Up there they calls it Their thighbones Them bones, them bones Gonna rise again Gonna exercise a friend Tries again Gonna tax us up to our eyes again When they gets up Off of their thighbones The country's In the very best of hands The best of hands The best of hands Them GOPs and Democrats Each hates the other one They's always criticizing How the country should be run But neither tells the public What the other's gone and done As long as no one knows Where no one stands The country's In the very best of hands The money that they taxes us That's known as revenues They compounds up collateral Subtracts the residues Don't worry about the principal And interest that accrues They're shipping all that stuff To foreign lands The country's In the very best of hands Abner, we's very happy to have you back for Sadie Hawkins Day. Now, I'd like to remind all the rest of you folks, the race starts at 2:00. So if you got any readying up to do, you'd better get to doing it. Ladies. Ladies. Get your Sadie Hawkins Day specials right here. Ropes, bear traps, running shoes. Get your cotton-picking hands off that. Ladies, ladies. Get your Sadie Hawkins Day special... Mammy, how come Daisy didn't come down to meet me? Maybe she don't want no part of you, son. Then again, maybe she does. - Hi, Daisy. - Hi, Abner. - Welcome home. - I sure missed you, Daisy. Sure missed you too, Abner. I'm sure glad I... ...got back in time for the race this afternoon. Sure you still want to go through with it, Abner? Well, sure I'm... ...sure. Well, has you figured out how I'm gonna catch you, I mean, so it won't be too embarrassing to your masculine pride and then so we both knows what we's doing? - Well, not exactly. - I has. - You has? - Yes, I has. Now, just close your attractive eyes and see if you can't visualize it. There we is at the starting line. The mayor shoots off his gun, and you takes off with your usual burst of brilliant speed. - Naturally. - I hightails it right after you. - I sees it. - You heads out for Repulsive Rock. - I got you. - Now, I takes the shortcut - over Hog Fat Boulevard. - I likes it. You sees me coming, so you ducks down through Sow Belly Lane. - I ducks. - Now I'm gaining on you, and we's - heading for the Promised Land. - Goose Grease Gulch. - Right. - I sees it now. As my feet starts slipping on them goose feathers, you starts gaining, a couple feet behind. You reaches out your hand. You spread your fingers to grab me. - I'm grabbing. Yes. - And then-- And then-- - I'm sorry, Daisy. - What happened? I puts on a brilliant burst of speed and dashes out of sight. You means you still ain't gonna let me catch you? Well, I don't know, Daisy, I sure intended to, but now I just don't know. Abner Yokum. But I knows this much, I'm gonna get in this race this afternoon, and I'm gonna do my darnedest to let you catch me. And I want you to know that no matter what happens, I wishes you the best of luck. Because if anybody deserves me, you do. What you got there, Available? I want one of them bats. I'm gonna get me a man with one of those. That's rope there, Available? - That's it buy now, pay now. - I'm gonna get me a bear trap. I'll give you your change next week. Available. Oh, Available. Well, howdy, Daisy Mae. What is on your scintillating and well-built little mind? Available, I was just wondering if you could fix-- I mean, arrange to make the Sadie Hawkins Day Race come out right. - So that you catches Li'l Abner. - Naturally. Daisy Mae Scragg, does you realize what you's asking? That I betray my neighbor, sell out my fellow man. What is there in this whole world makes you think that I could sink to such slimy depths of moral depravity and human degradation? - Fifty cents. - Could you make that a dollar? - Maybe could. - You has a deal. Abner will be stopped in that race today by the only diabolical device in creation fully guaranteed to freeze - a fear-crazed bachelor in full flight. - Namely? Stupefyin'... ...Jones. - Deal? - Deal. All right, dearie. Shake. Not you. Her. - Remember, I'm depending on you. - Your money is in the best of hands. Move it along, honey. Available. Available. Available. There's our man now. - Howdy, Available. - Howdy, senator. Available, is you available? - I's always available. - Come right on over here and meet the Honorable General Bullmoose. Well, welcome to Dogpatch, general. I'd say, "What's your pleasure, sir?" But I see you've done brought it with you. Jones, we've got to stop Abner Yokum dead in his tracks this afternoon so that Appassionata here can catch him. Naturally. And there's only one man for the job. A refugee from justice who's hiding out in these hills. A man whose name comprises the three foulest words in the English language, namely Evil Eye Fleagle. Evil Eye Fleagle? What's he like? Picture the warm friendliness of a rattlesnake. Picture 5-foot-4 of menacing manhood. Picture a hat covering a face of sinister rapacity. Picture two eyes peering out with supernatural powers of malevolent intent. Someone call me? Sashay on over here and meet the general. Evil Eye Fleagle at your service. You actually paralyze with your eyes? It is known in paralyzing circles as Fleagle's Famous Fabulous "Fracturizing” Whammy. Can you put that whammy in Abner Yokum long enough - for Miss Von Climax to catch him? - Naturally. Get the picture. Sadie Hawkins Day begins. The gun goes off. Bachelors running. Maidens pursuing. Yokum comes dashing by. I jumps up and down. Rotates my eyeballs. Rears back and lets fly a triple whammy, which hits the fleeing Yokum smack in the back. - And then? - His bone marrow freezes. His pancreas petrifies. All of his red corpuscles, white corpuscles suddenly stand stock-still and stupidly stare at each other. Whereupon who dashes up and claims the body, but this superbly stacked young lady. - Is he dead? - With Yokum, you can't always tell. - Will you guarantee he'll thaw? - Absolutely. Fleagle, you deliver Yokum, and you've got a job with me for life. At your service. I've got confidence in that little fella. He's the same color as money. - Holy mackerel there, mayor. - Heck fire! All right, you miserable, fear-crazed bachelors. When I shoots off this gun, you will disperse backside over teakettle in all directions. When I shoots this gun off the second time, this bevy of love-starved, valentine-believing maidens will take after you. Now, there are no rules. Remember, everything goes. - Bachelors ready? - Yeah! - Maidens ready? - Yeah! Sadie Hawkins Day is officially-- Not yet. Get back in your position, boy. All right, then, Sadie Hawkins Day is officially begun. I pronounces you man and wife. Washington, D.C. While the world continues to await the final outcome of the tests of the miraculous Yokumberry Tonic, the hearts of America have gone out to Abner Yokum and Appassionata Von Climax. In what is to be truly the marriage of the century. This spectacular event will take place at the estate of General Bullmoose on Tuesday next. Daisy? Oh, hello, Sam. I knows how you feels, Daisy. I misses him too. It ain't just missing him, Sam. All day I's had this cold, shuddery kind of feeling. I just knows Li'l Abner's in some kind of real mortal danger. What makes you so sure? I always gets this terrible feeling when Abner's in trouble. It's a clutch-and-grabbing feeling right in here. You know what I mean, Sam? Course I do, honey. But when I gets that feeling it's either a mite of gas, the approach of a creditor or I buttoned the wrong button on my drawers. Oh, I'm so miserable, Sam. Well, if you really feels that Abner's in mortal trouble, go see Mammy and have her conjure up one of her visions. You know she's got the mystical power to see if her boy is in trouble. I did ask Mammy to conjure. She's up at the cabin right now making the preparations. But I don't know whether she can conjure all the way up to Washington. Don't you worry about Mammy. She'll conjure, all right. Hi, Daisy. Hi, Sam. Wait, wait a minute. Where y'all going? We's leaving for Washington to pick up our newly beautified husbands. Yeah, the government said it was okay. Oh, wait, and what y'all carrying there? We just bought these from Available Jones. It's a special happiness-guaranteed on-your-second-honeymoon do-it-yourself kit. Well, let's see what's in them? A black lace nightie. Some sweet-smelling perfume. And that new romantic album, Music to Scratch Your Back By. That ought to do the job. Moonbeam, when you get up to Washington, would you tell Li'l Abner hello for me if you sees him, please? I sure will, Daisy. Well, we'd better get on down to the station or we'll miss our train. - Yeah, I think so. - Bye, Sam. - Bye, Daisy. - Bye, Sam. - See y'all. - Bye now. - I can't hardly wait to get there. - I could just cry. Everybody's so in love. Now, now, everything's gonna be just fine for you. No, Sam, how could it be? Well, who'd wanna marry me now? I waited around so long I'm plumb wasted away. That may be, honey, but what you got left over is more than what most folks - starts out with. - No, Sam. I looked in the mirror this morning, and there's no doubt about it, my good years is gone. I guess you're right. After all, you is pushing 18. I'm past my prime What a shame. And I'm losin' time Guess the old clock's run down. - Seventeen last spring - My, what a wasted life - Still without a ring - Would you become my wife? I'm past my peak You's an early antique - Look at this physique - Just hear the old bones creak - Where there was a glow - Ain't there a glow no more? - Now the wrinkles show - Where art thou, Romeo? Who'd think of marrying An octogenarian? - An 87-year-old hag - An 87-year-old hag When you's in this position You lose your disposition - All the time it's nag, nag, nag - All the time it's nag, nag, nag Life's like a song - And the happiest thing - When you're young and strong Most every day is spring - But it's just a crime - You can't get off the dime - When you're past your prime - When you're past your prime You's past your prime - Gettin' grumpy and gray - You's on overtime Ain't making take-home pay - Every sun that sets - All through the day, I frets - Brings you more regrets - And larger silhouettes You's climbed the heights - I is over the hill - Of romantic nights My hand has lost its skill - Comes the cruel dawn - I's feelin' pale and drawn - Lover boy has gone - Doggone I ask you who's elated When you's "Methuselated” - Like a mummy underground - Like a mummy underground When you is antiquated Boys leave "dejectaquated” - They prefers you in the round - They prefers you in the round Life's just like pie Huckleberry or peach? - When you're young and spry - Heaven's within your reach - But it's just a crime - How can it be sublime? - When you're past your prime - When you're past your prime - When you're past your prime - When you're past your prime - When you're past your prime - When you're past your prime Oh, evil spirits of another world. Oh, half god, gather the sights and sounds of the supernatural. Pansy Yokum craves your indulgence while I conjures up a vision of my boy in Washington, D.C. Beaks of owls and reptiles' gizzards Claws of bats and toes of lizards Eels and snakes and other vipers Also bugs on windshield wipers Caldron hiss and caldron bubble Tell me if my boy's in trouble - Hello. - Oh, hello, general. - This is Dr. Schlifit speaking. - Yes, doctor. Disastrous news, general. For international reasons, the government has ordered that the Yokumberry tests be completed - by tomorrow midnight. - Tomorrow midnight? - Yes, sir. - That means I've gotta move fast. Stay where you are, doctor, you'll hear from me. How do you like that? They've moved up the deadline on those tests to tomorrow midnight. - No. - That means that Yokum will be giving his drug to the government before - he's married to Appassionata. - I'll be dogged. Well, by Simmons' mattress and all his springs, - I'm not taking this lying down. - What will you do, Bullsie? If I can't get the rights to Yokumberry Tonic, I'll at least get Yokum to tell me the secret formula so I can make the stuff myself. And there's only one man for the job. Press my Evil Eye Fleagle button. You sent for me, boss? Now, Fleagle, I only have until midnight tomorrow to get a secret formula out of Yokum. Now, have you got a whammy that can make a man tell the absolute truth? Naturally. It's known as Fleagle's Famous Non-prevaricating - "Veracitizing" Truth Whammy. - Good. Now, what would you like on that whammy? The truth, the whole truth, the half-truth or a little of each? You've got a whammy that'll make a man tell half the truth? Certainly. Among used-car dealers, it's one of my biggest items. But, Bullsie, what happens to Yokum after you get the formula? We proceed with Fleagle's original plan. Right. I gives him my Suicidal Sports Car Whammy. He jumps into some handy convertible and drives himself off the nearest cliff. - Capital, "veracitize" him at once. - Okay, who gets him loaded? Loaded? This truth whammy only works when a victim is gassed, pickled, under the influence of alcohol. But, Bullsie, you know Abner doesn't drink. - Why not? - He says he's 100-percent red-blooded American, and no 100-percent red-blooded American drinks, smokes, tells naughty jokes, necks, pets or smooches. Then who gave this country a population of 160 million? Some oversexed subversives. There must be some way to get that boy to take a drink. What about the society party you're giving us tomorrow night? Oh, we've got him. No 100-percent red-blooded American would dare refuse to drink a toast to his prospective bride. Champagne all right? - Champagne's perfect. - Good, then proceed as planned. - Right, boys? - Right. He calls the shots and he expects To keep it thataway What's good for General Bullmoose Is good for the U.S.A. Oh, my boy. Oh, my boy, my boy, my boy. - My poor baby boy. - What did you see happen? - Oh, my sweet baby boy. - Oh, Mammy, what did you see? Oh, you was right, child, you was right. He is in terrible mortal danger. - They means to kill him. - Who does? General Bullmoose. I seen the whole miserable plan. They means to nuptialize him, veracitize him, "suicize" him. - Suicize him? - We've gotta do something. - We gotta act fast. - We gotta get up to Washington. - Daisy, I desires words with you. - Hush up, Earthquake. - I loves you, gal. - Not now, Earthquake. They must be some way we can get help. How we ever gonna defeat a strong force like General Bullmoose? We don't have any power. That's right. Nobody's strong enough to-- Earthquake. Li'l Abner's in terrible trouble up to Washington, maybe get killed if we don't help him. Yeah, that's a crying shame. Now, Daisy, honey, if you marry me, - I'll do anything for you. - All right, Earthquake, I will. You will? - Daisy! - What you saying? - On one condition. - What's that? That you comes up to Washington and you uses your brute strength to help save Li'l Abner's life. And if I does, you solemn promises to give yourself to me? I solemn promises to give myself to you. - Body and soul? - Body and soul. One at a time or both together? You takes your pick. Lady, you just got yourself a passport to ecstasy. Not now, Earthquake. We ain't got time. We're gonna need help. You get those ornery Scraggs and anybody else that can scrap. Tell them to bring their socializing clothes. - A soup and fish? - That's right because we's heading for high-society country, and when we gets there, there ain't gonna be anybody soupier or fishier than we is. - Come on, Pappy. - Come on, Mammy. Abner? Daisy. What you doing here? I sneaked in, Abner. I had to come to warn you, warn you to run away for your life. - What are you talking about? - You're in terrible mortal danger. You daren't marry Miss Appassionata. Daisy, how can you say such a terrible thing? You knows we lives by the code of the hills, and she won me fair and square. - But-- - Besides, Miss Appassionata has been planning to marry me, and I ain't about to break no more hearts than I already has. - But they's aiming to kill you. - Who is? That General Bullmoose and your precious intended. Daisy, how can you say such a terrible thing? It's true. They aims to nuptialize you, veracitize you and suicize you. Daisy, I's starting to get angry. You's making this up out of your head because you're a poor gal who's still miserably in love with me. For which I can't blame you, because I could see how it could happen. Oh, Abner Yokum, you run for your life. Daisy, you go on home and forget all about me. - No, Abner. - Get out of here. That's an order. - No, Abner. - Get, I has spoken. May I? Now me. There he is. Stop! Stop or there'll be bloodshed. - How about that. - Now, all of you, out. Don't hurt them, they're my kinfolk. Mammy and Pappy, you shouldn't ought have done this. After all, I give my word. Start moving. Earthquake, do something. That's right, Earthquake, do something, do something like you promised. You and your big mouth back in Dogpatch. - Now, all of you, out. - Just a minute, everybody, wait up. General Bullmoose, sir, we sorry we caused this disturbance, but we was under the impression you aim to harm our good friend Abner, who we loves and adores. - Preposterous. - But we was wrong, so we'll go, and quietlike. Why, you miserable, double-crossing-- Snake in the grass. - Earthquake, you's a gentleman. - Thank you, Abner. But I'd sure like us all to part friends, so I'm asking you, Brother Bullmoose, to let us all join you in drinking a toast to Abner - and the future Mrs. Yokum. - You no-good, miserable-- Well, I'm not one to harbor a grudge. Waiter, champagne. I told you he was real friendly-like. And now, ladies and gentlemen, a toast to the lovely young bride-to-be. May the flower of her sweet innocence burst into blossom and bring joy to this fine young man. I give you that sterling example of red-blooded American manhood, Abner Yokum. There you is, a ricochet truth "whammified” Mr. Bullmoose. Earthquake, you lovable rat, we got him. Now he's got to tell the truth. Mr. Policeman, just you listen. General Bullmoose, is you or is you not a no-good, dirty, double-crossing, finagling crook? Would you repeat the question? Is you or is you not a no-good, dirty, double-crossing, - finagling crook? - Yes, madam, I am. And just what did you intend doing with Abner Yokum? Subject him to Evil Eye Fleagle's truth whammy. - So he'd tell you... - The secret formula - of Yokumberry Tonic. - Then you intended to... Further use the nefarious E.E. Fleagle. The purpose being... Put a suicidal whammy on the gullible Yokum. Then the poor fool would... - Jump in my fastest sports car. - And subsequently... Drive himself over the nearest cliff. - Making it appear like... - Accidental death. When for real and true, it was... Cold-blooded, premeditated murder. There you has it, a confessed murderer. Take him away. But, Bullsie. Bullsie! Attention, everyone. All residents of Dogpatch are hereby ordered to return home immediately - and resume their orderly evacuation. - Evacuation? Are you crazy, man? The evacuation and the bombing will be concluded tomorrow. But, Mr. Army-Man, what about our Yokumberry Tonic? I'm sorry, the tests have been declared a total failure. Now, attention. All you women whose husbands have been used as guinea pigs, a special bus will take you to the laboratory immediately. And, Yokum, I'm afraid you'll have to - come along with them. - Yes, sir. What about our newly beautified husbands? - Is they all right? - You'll find out at the laboratory. This way, Yokum. Wait a minute. I earned you fair and square. You coming with me. Please, Earthquake, not till I find out what happens to Li'l Abner. Please, Earthquake, dear. But remember, you mine now.

Ladies, will the rest of you embrace your husbands? Luke. Clem. Hey, Rufe. Cy. Hey, what's wrong with them? They don't care about us no more? Ladies, I'm afraid these tests have tragically demonstrated that while Yokumberry Tonic will make men physically perfect, eternally youthful and incredibly attractive, they unfortunately lose all romantic interest. Good gosh, they's all become Li'l Abners. Precisely. - What's we gonna do now? - It's inhuman. You can't leave them like that. You just can't! Put them back The way they was Oh, put them back The way they was They was dumb They was heathen But at least they was breathin' So whatever else you've done Put them back the way they was - Put them back - Put them back - The way they was - The way they was Oh, put them back the way they was They was plumb unattractive But by gum, they was active So I beg you kindly because Put them back the way they was Put them back The way they was Oh, put them back the way they was They was not known for beauty But they sure done their duty And the made the boudoir buzz Put them back the way they was They was long, lean and lanky But they loved hanky-panky That's a pastime we prefers Put them back the way they was They was vile-lookin' varmints Wearing vile-lookin' garments But they knowed a his from hers Put them back the way they was - Put them back - Put them back - The way they was - The way they was Oh, put them back the way they was They was no shakes as lovers But they warmed up the covers Covered as they was with fuzz Put them back The way they was Attention, ladies. There's a bus waiting outside to take you back to Dogpatch. But, Mr. Army-Man, what is we gonna do? Return to Dogpatch and proceed with the evacuation. But what about our husbands? They must remain here. Now, please move along. - You can't leave them like that. - Please, ladies. I love my husband. Move along, now. Move along, ladies. I'm afraid you folks will have to come along too. We'll move along directly. If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, I wouldn't have believed it. Mr. Scientist, is they the way they is and Abner the way he is because he's been taking Yokumberry Tonic all his life? Regretfully true, Miss Scragg. Oh, that no-good, miserable tree. The bus is waiting. Do they all go? All except these men and Mr. Yokum. We'll need you for further study. Yes, sir. All right, men. Out this way, please. Come along, folks. Well, Daisy, I guess this is goodbye for a while. It's goodbye forever, Abner. Forever? Why? Because I promised Earthquake that if he'd come up to Washington and use his brute strength to help save your life that him and me would get married. Well, he did, and we's gonna. Earthquake? Could I have one moment alone with Daisy? - Before she leaves? - Well... Please, Earthquake. No messing around. No messing around. Oh, Abner, I'm so miserable I could die. I knows how you feels, Daisy, but we lives by the code of the hills, and a promise is a promise. Yeah, but they's something we could do. It's too late now. But don't you worry none. Earthquake is bound to be a good man, once he's married up with you. It ain't never gonna be like it could've been with you. I know, Daisy. I know. Oh, Abner. I wish it could be otherwise Otherwise, I'm sorry we met at all I'm sorry we ever had to start with Those wonderful dreams You broke my heart with ! wish there was some other way Like it is Our backs is against the wall Just seems that - Fate put this heart of mine - Fate put this heart of mine - Under some Injun sign - Under some Injun sign - Or otherwise, you'd still be mine - Or otherwise, you'd still be mine - All mine - All mine - Or otherwise - Or otherwise - You'd still be mine - You'd still be mine Time, Daisy. I done it. It was all my fault. I ruined my own boy. - Mammy, I got something to say. - Hush. I never should've give Abner that tonic. - I should've known-- - Now, Mammy, I'm gonna be heard. I said, hush. Why didn't I have more sense? - Why didn't I realize--? - Well, you gonna listen to me. Would you hush up? You little pipsqueak. You hush up. - What? - For once, you gonna hush and stay hushed. I got some private talking to do with my boy, and by gum, I'm going to do it. - But, Pappy, I was only gonna try-- - Now you get, woman, get. I'll see when you when I get back in Dogpatch. If I takes a notion to. - But, Pappy, I-- - Get! I has spoken! Boys, come in here. Boys, come here. I want you to listen to this and listen careful because I think I got a way how to get you out of your miserable condition. - Well, what is it? - A special potion developed by our beloved founder, Jubilation T. Cornpone. Oh, Pappy, we've taken enough tonics and potions already. Yes, but you haven't taken Cornpone's powerfully potent, perpetually "passionizing” and romanticizing potion. Pappy, could that potion romanticize me and put these boys back the way they was? Well, son, all I can tell you is that when I was your age, I had a mite of your trouble myself, so I took me a little swig of that potion. - And what happened? - As I wiped my lips, your sweet, ugly little Mammy come a-walking by. And I can only tell you that that dried-up, sawed-off little creature looked to me like Lillian Russell, Gloria Swanson and a plate of pork chops rolled into one. What are we waiting for? Come on. Just a minute. There's one mighty special and important condition that goes with this potion. You see, it only works if you really wants it to work. Oh, I does, Pappy, more than anything else in the whole world. Well, then get a-going. That wedding ain't waiting for man or beast, and with Earthquake, that covers both ends. Right. Come on. \Western Union, please. I wants to send a telegram to Marryin' Sam, Dogpatch, U.S.A. Message? Well, just three words: Stall, stall, stall. All right, Sam. We only got 20 minutes. So start "festivitating” the festivities. Earthquake, why don't you wait till we's relocated. No, sir. With all this shuffling around, the queen liable to shuffle herself right out in the deck. Right, Cousin Romeo? You're so right, Cousin McGoon. - So start festivitating. - Very well. Dearly beloved, we is gathered here today-- Earthquake, I can't do it. Can't do what? I can't shortchange you. You wants a $8 wedding, I gotta get into a $8 mood. There's no way of knowing how long it's gonna take me to get there. I'm there. Dearly beloved-- Dearly belove-- Dearly beloved-- Dearly beloved! Come on, Sam, we ain't got much time. So hurry up and get down to the "I does-es.” Well, that's right, Sam, proceed. Only I do wish, Earthie, dear, that you'd wait till all the rest of my kinfolk get here. Account of this wedding is gonna mean so much to them. Why, of course, my dear. With the bombing and all, they just can't wait to get into their nice, new home. - Naturally. - With their new, rich relative. Most assuredly, my-- Rich relative? Who? - Why, you, of course. - Me? You don't think a Scragg would let another Scragg go homeless, as long as they was related to anyone as well-heeled as the world's dirtiest wrestler. You mean you want these three miserable Scraggs to come and live with us? Why, of course. You is a first-class provider, Cousin McGoon. - The others will be along directly. - Others? I sent Speedy McRabbit out to tell them all the good news. I knew you'd want it that way, Earthie, dear. - Well, no, I never counted on-- - Hi, Cousin Earthie! Say, look who's here. Why, it's Uncle Unbearable Scragg and his three darling children, Unthinkable, Unwashable and Unhuman. Say hello to your new, rich relative. - Hi, Cousin Earthie. - Thanks for the invite. - When do we eat? - Hi, cousin. Why look who come out of the swamp? Hi, Cousin Earthie. It's Unappetizing Scragg and his two dazzling daughters, Priceless and Liceless. - Welcome to the family, cousin. - He sure is generous. Hi, Cousin Earthie. Oh, well, upon my soul, it's the Bar Harbor Scraggs. Yeah, they've been barred from every harbor in the country. The children will be here in the morning. What time is you serving dinner? Well, Sam, ain't you got some marrying to do? I sure has. Well, batten down your hatches and grab hold of each other while I lets fly with my $8 wedding. Dearly beloved We is gathered here today He's startin' to dearly beloved To put an unfortunate Miserable critter away Better he was hung first Remember poor Adam Who got married and so began That miserable race of creatures - Known as the married man - Married man Then think about Samson - Who was Israel's strongest male - The strongest Till little Delilah went - And give him a ponytail - Ponytail State your objections Or forever hold your peace He's telling you State your objections You signing a genuine, ironclad Permanent lease Never no escape clause Don't let me influence you In saying those fatal words - Fatal words - Just let me remind you - Getting married is for the birds - For the birds Now if you still wants This little gal as your lawful mate By powers invested I pronounces you man and-- Wait. Hold on there. Hold it, Sam, stop the wedding. That's right, stop the wedding. Did you say, "Stop the wedding"? That's right, I'm gonna claim Daisy Mae for myself. You'll laugh out of the other side of your faces when Pappy gets here with his Cornpone's passionizing and romanticizing potion. - There ain't no such potion. - Oh, yes, there is. Now, wait a minute. Maybe there is and maybe there isn't, but I gotta say something. This here lovely young gal's been in love with this fine boy all her life. And even if it means giving up my passport to ecstasy and giving up all these fine family ties, I'm willing to make the sacrifice. Hold on. What about our passport? Besides, there ain't no such potion. Oh, yes, they is. I've got it. I've got it. - Here it is, son. - Thanks, Pappy. Now, remember, son, it only works if you really and truly wants it to work. Oh, I does, Pappy. I sure does. What's in that jug, Pappy? Just a little old creek water, Mammy. Just some plain old creek water. - Daisy. - Oh, Abner. Li'l Abner, does you take Daisy Mae For your wife? I does - And, Daisy, is you agreed? - I reckon I always was And now with my blessings I pronounces you-- Wait! Look who's here, our big, oversized husbands. Pappy, give me that jug. Put them back The way they was Oh, they is back The way they was They's uncouth and unpleasant But at least they is present Doing things that we prefer Welcome back the way you were And now with my blessings, I pronounces you-- Wait. Wait. Stop the wedding. - Your time is up. - But I'm almost done. But the plane and the bomb are on their way. - But I got just three more words. - Not a word, not a syllable. Three itty-bitty words. Out, do you hear me? Out. On your way. We're not leaving without our statue of Jubilation. - Right, Mayor Dawgmeat? - Right. Let's go get our statue. Yes, come on. Let's get our statue. Take it easy, now. Don't hurt it. Take it down. Something fell out of the statue. Hey, look, there's some writing here, - signed "Abraham Lincoln." - There are trucks waiting-- Abraham Lincoln? Here, just listen to this. "Because of his lack of strategy, his military blunders, and his general ineptness, which almost single-handedly enabled the North to win this Civil War, a grateful government dedicates this statue of General Jubilation T. Cornpone, proclaiming it a national shrine." Good heavens, it's a national shrine. And you can't deface a national shrine. You can't deface it, you can't move it, and you can't bomb it. You're absolutely right. Stop that plane. Notify Washington. Citizens of Dogpatch, the evacuation is ended. And now with my blessings I pronounces you... - Wait. - Why? This joyful event can't be consummated until we pays homage to the one man who made all this possible. Who romanticized this boy? Who put them back the way they was? And who saved our town from being bombed? None other than that beloved man that's sitting up there on that even more beloved horse, Jubilation T. Cornpone. Though he's gone to his reward His mighty torch is still lit First in war, first in peace First to holler, "I quit!” Oh, it was Jubilation T. Cornpone Unshaven-and-Shorn-pone Jubilation T. Cornpone He really saved the day Why, it was Jubilation T. Cornpone Unshaven-and-Shorn-pone Jubilation T. Cornpone He really saved the day
