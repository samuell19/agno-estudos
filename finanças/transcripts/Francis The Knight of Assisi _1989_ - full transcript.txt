(tense gentle music) (footsteps thumping) (tense music) - The cowardly blood in that boy, is from your side of the family. - Francis, what happened son? - You disgrace me. You disgrace our family. - No father, God has spoken to me. He wants something from me. - Is that right? What is it he wants? - I don't know yet, but I do know, it's something important. - Mark my word Francis. If you won't fight, you will work for me now. You will earn your keep in the marketplace.

It's painful. - I know it's difficult, but be patient Francis. The Lord, God comes first, and only he can tell you your destiny. (birds chirping) (rain drizzling) - And give me Lord, a correct faith. Ascertain hope, a perfect charge. (gentle music) - (God)Francis. You must restore my church, for it is falling into ruin. - Yes, Lord. I will restore your church. (lively music) - Francis. It's a good thing your father is away. - Mother, now I know what God wants of me. I'm going to rebuild the church at Sain Damiano. I'll need money. I can sell these cloth for gold. - I hope you know what you're doing. (soft music) (groaning) - Francis, what's come over you? (soft music) - He's gone mad. (laughing) - Just wait till his father gets home. (gentle soft music) - He what? (roaring) This is the last straw. He won't fight. He refuses to work at my shop, and now he steals from me. He is out of his mind. - But Pietro, he's your son. - He shall pay. For he shall no longer be called a son of mine. (crowd murmuring) - Francis is really gonna get it now. - Your excellency, as you've heard by now, my son has gone totally mad. In the name of God. He, he steals from his own father. - Francis, even if you wish to serve our Lord, you must return your father's gold. - I want it all the back. Everything. - Your excellency, I will not only give him his gold, but the clothes off my back. I give him everything as he requests. listen all. up until now, I have called Pietro Bernardone my father. But from now on, I shall say only, our father who art in heaven. - You renounce your rightful inheritance. - Yes, your excellency. I shall go naked to meet the Lord. And I will restore the chapel at San Damiano, with my bare hands if I have to. (crowd murmuring) (soft music) - He's out of his mind. - I'm not so sure. something tells me we may have much to learn from Francis. Don't underestimate him. (laughing and cheering) - (Francis) Stones. I need stones to repair the chapel at San Damiano. (cartwheel thudding) Won't you give stones for the Lord's house. (soft music) (trash thudding) (laughing) - Here you go beggar. Here's your stones. (dog growling) (suspenseful music) (screaming) (dog barking) (dog growls) - Stop. (dog growling) come here. I'm ashamed of you, brother, dog. Be kind to these children, and maybe they'll feed you. (laughing and cheering) - (crowd)Yeah - stones for the Lord's house. Won't you give stones - Here Francis, for the house of Jesus. - My little friend, it is in giving that we receive true joy. (gentle solemn music) (footsteps thumping) Bernard you're a good man. - Oh am a rich man, a few stones and some mortar mean little to me. I admire you Francis. Rebuilding this church all alone. - But I'm not alone Bernard. (gentle uplifting music) (goat bleating) (brick thudding) (laughing) (thunder rumbling) (rain drizzling) (gentle music) (air whooshing) (birds chirping) (lively music) (birds and insects chirping) - Now give it a try. (lively music) (bells chiming) Good (screaming) (grass squishing) (laughing) (bell chiming) (gentle soft music) - Many in the congregation could be sick. - No Pietro, it's not the people who are sick. It is the church itself. We must face the truth. Francis is reaching the people. He's bringing them back to the church at San Damiano. - He's dangerous. He somehow tricks them. - No, it is by example that Francis inspires. He speaks to the people and they listen. (footsteps thumping) I'm beginning to believe he is divinely inspired. - Go out and preach. Carry, neither gold or silver nor bag for the journey nor two tunics, nor sandals, nor a staff and preach as you go. Saying the kingdom of God is at hand. (soft music) - (Francis)My Lord, now I know. you weren't asking me to rebuild crumbling walls of stone, but to rebuild the collapsing faith of my brothers and sisters. Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is kingdom of heaven. - Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted. Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth. Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled. (gentle uplifting music) - (Pietro)Bernard, you are my last chance. Speak to Francis. Tell him I'll even allow him back into the family, if he just stops this nonsense. Will you help me? - All Right, Pietro, I will speak to him. (laughing) - My friends, Won't you share your good fortune with those In need? (laughing) - Look what's become of Francis. (laughing) Where's the Francis we used to know? The warrior, the one who would fight for glory. (gentle music) - Not all glory is found on the battlefield Eduardo. - Come on Francis, come on. Be a man. (laughing) (rumbling) (laughing) (rumbling) (body thuds) - Enough. (footsteps pattering) How can you do this to your own friend. (gentle soft music) (footsteps thumping) - Francis? (footsteps thumping) - Lord, make me an instrument of your peace. Where there is it's hatred, let me so love. Where there is injury, pardon. - Francis, may I confess something to you? - Of course Bernard. - I have everything a could want in life, money, possessions status, and yet never have I felt so empty inside. - I know the feeling. - The more I have, the more miserable I am. I mean it with you. It seems the less you have, the happier you are. How can this be? - I become richer and richer each passing day with God's love. And you can become as rich as I am Bernard. The Lord refuses no man. (gentle uplifting music) - What's going on? - God bless you, sir. God bless you. - Bernard, are you sure you want to renounce your title? Give away all that you want. - Francis. I no longer have need of earthly possessions. - You've made a friend for life, brother. - You are the best friend a man could ever have Francis - Bernard. I wasn't speaking of myself, you've made friends with our heavenly father. (gentle uplifting music) (Pietro rumbles) (soft music) - My brothers, though our numbers are small. We still need rules for life. I propose we form a new order to live and preach. Simply as Christ himself did. we will follow his life of poverty, chastity, and obedience. We will help the sick and the poor. (soft music) (birds chirping) - Who's there? - Don't be afraid. I am Francis and these are my brothers. - We're lepers go away. - There is no need for shame. We are all God's children. Please come out and share in our love for him. (soft music) Hold your head high brother. In God's eyes we are all men no more and no less. (birds chirping) (footsteps pattering) - Francis Bernardone has broken from the church and formed an entirely new order. And this order of his is growing. - And they're actually touching the lepers. (crowd yelling) - But he is speaking the words of the gospel, and helping the poor. - Your excellency, who gave him the authority to do form this new order and preach the gospel. (crowd rumbling) Who gave him the authority to speak on God's behalf. No one. Your excellency should ban him from Assisi. (crowd yelling) - But keep him out. Keep him out. - Yeah keep him out ,tell him to go away. (crowd yelling) - Move, go away, we don't want you. - Go away. (air whooshing) - Have faith brothers. (crowd yelling) - We don't want him, send him out, throw him out of the gates. (stones thudding) - Francis, for your own good, if you are going to start a new order, you must go and get permission from the Pope. - Then we shall go to Rome, your excellency, and speak to the Pope himself. (laughing) - The pope listening to you. That'll be the day. (crowd yelling) - Keep him out, send him out, throw him out. - (Francis)And so your holiness, we want to form a new order. And live humbly, according to the gospel and help strengthen the faith of the church. - Francis, I admire your self sacrifice and your dedication, but your rules are too strict for your brothers. - They are not my rules, your holiness, but the rules of Christ himself. - I'm sorry, Francis, but I must deny your request. (gentle soft music) (footsteps thumping) (door creaking) (soft music) - All our hopes, all our efforts, all our prayers. I can't believe we've come all this way for nothing. (fire hissing) - Do not despair, brother Bernard, we must pray even harder. I know God is listening. (soft music) (snoring) (suspenseful music) (wind whooshing) (ground rumbling) (bricks and stones thudding) (glass shattering) (bricks thudding) (uplifting music) - Ah! It's Francis, it's Francis of Assisi who will help save the church. Bring him to me at once. (soft music) (footsteps pattering) - I was once a young man like you Francis, and I too wanted to help change the world, wanted to help the poor and the sick find God's love. Last night after prayer, I saw that you saved the church. It is God's will that I hereby give you and your new order, my full blessing. - Thank you your holiness. - Go Francis of Assisi. Go and be a true light for the church. (soft music) (footsteps thumping) - You always wanted to be proud of Francis, Pietro. He and his new order have been blessed by the Pope himself. And the Bishop has invited Francis to our cathedral. Won't you come and listen to your own son speak the word of God. - Lord, make me an instrument of your peace. Where there is hatred, let me so love. Where there is injury, pardon. Where there is doubt, faith. Where it's despair, hope. where there is darkness, light. And where there is sadness, joy. Oh, divine master, grant that I may not so much as seek to be consoled as to console. - To be understood - to be understood, - as to understand. - as to understand. - To be loved, as to love. - to be loved, as to love. - For it is in giving, - For it is in giving, - that we receive - that we receive - It is in pardoning, - it is in pardoning, - that we are pardoned - that we are pardoned. - It is in dying that we, - it is in dying that we, - are born to eternal life. - are born to eternal life.
