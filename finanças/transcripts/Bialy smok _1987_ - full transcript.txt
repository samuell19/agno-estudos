(wind rustling) (downbeat music) (animal's roaring cry) (gentle music) (birds chirping) (dog barking) - Come on Mara. I'm bored, what am I going to do? - [Jim] I don't know, what do you wanna do? - Remember the game? - [Jim] Uh huh. - I thought you were gonna get it for me? - I'm afraid you'll have to forget about it for now. - Why? - Steve, please stop asking me so many questions. - That wasn't very nice of you to say. - Okay. Just remember when you grow up, it's not a good idea to beat up the brother-in-law of the park commissioner, even if the guy shouldn't be shooting up all the deer. - That why you lost your job? - Yep. - You gonna go to jail? - Please leave me alone, alright Steve? - [Steve] Can I tell you something? - No. - Know why you're always getting in trouble? - I said no. - [Steve] Because you're too jumpy. - You think so, huh? - [Steve] Hey Dad, there's a chopper coming! (dog barking) - Hi. - Hi. - Is that your dog? - Yes sir. - Looks dangerous. - Not to me. - Good. Is that your dad? - Yep. - Jim Martin. Frank Brown. - Merco Industries? THE Frank Brown? - You can call me Frank. - How did you find me? - I can find anyone I want, right now I want you. Does the name "Karistan" mean anything to you? - It's a country on a map. (helicopter whirring) - Okay Jim. Back to the business at hand. This country Karistan got very rich mineral deposits. - Uh huh. - A government that's willing to give a five year developmental lease on those deposits. You see what I'm getting at? - Want me to do an environmental impact study. - Oh I don't, the government does. You see I need somebody who can interpret the data we've got, make a quick on-site inspection, that's where you come in. - Why me? - 'Cause I only hire the best. - Thank you very much. - We've done our part, but our government requires that everything we've done be verified by an outside independent. Like yourself. - I understand that. - I hear you got yourself into a jam. - Story of my life. - You could wind up in court this time. - If you say so. - And you've lost your job. Now you work for me. People that work for me don't go to court. - What about my son? - Take anybody you want. - That would be it. - Fine. Just go in there for a few days, verify the data, put your rubber stamp in the right place, that's it. And on your way out see Carol, she's got a check for you. - Okay. Hey, Steve, now listen. Stay here, you guard the baggage and I'll go over and talk to this lady, okay? Excuse me, are there any messages for Jim Martin? - [Woman] From who? - [Jim] Jim Martin. - [Woman] No. (laughing) - Dad, why is he looking at us? - You're just imagining things. Go on. - You are waiting for a taxi? - Yes. That's what we're doing. - It's Sunday. - Yes. Yes. - No taxis on Sunday. - Why? - It's Sunday. (bell ringing) (children laughing and talking) [Child] THE WITCH! (children screaming) - [Jim] Slow down! Are you crazy?! (honking) Slow down! - [Steve] Dad, we're out of control! - What's the matter? - This stupid! - What? - No brakes! - What do you mean? (honking) - [Steve] We're gonna crash! Help, get me outta here, Dad! (banging) - Idiot! - [Steve] Look out! - Hold on! - Dad! (murmuring) - Jeezus! Steve, you okay? - Where the heck are we? - I don't know, son. - [Superintendent] Mr. Martin? - Yes? - Welcome to Grodo. - Thank you. - You see what's it like here. But we've all changed. People will come, they will build houses. Transport will improve. At least a road will get built. - Who's that girl? Down there. - She is daughter of witch who lives there. - A witch? - People will say different things. - Maybe I could stay there, instead of walking up and down from town every day. I could be right at the spot. - I would not advise that. She's a bit, eh, "different". But, who knows? - Yeah, sure. I don't care what she does, the point is she lives close to the mountains. - I'm afraid that it would be a waste of time. She won't take you, anyway. - I'll pay her. - She does not need your money. She's a witch, I told you. - She doesn't ride a broomstick at night, does she? (chuckling) - You Americans, you do not believe in anything. - I can't believe in anything that I haven't seen. Let's go. We'll see how really scary she is. - It isn't...it's no use going there. A waste of time. (gentle music) (bird calling) (mystical music) - Do not be afraid. Nothing will harm you here. You want to tell me. Come back to the memory. Try. - Wings. Huge. Eyes. Cat eyes. They burn. They fly away. - To where, Stein, to where? - To the mountains. - The way... Do you see the way? - High. His cave. (animal's roaring cry) I ... I don't know, it's... (animal growl, then roaring cry) Fall down. (knocking) - (shouting) Who is it! You. - Yes, I wanted to have a word with you and I wanted-- - Yes? Stein, I tell you to wait. Stein! You'll never find the speech again. - You listen. How many times have I warned you about practicing your craft on these simple people? I realize that the Middle Ages have been over for centuries and we no longer burn witches but we haven't stopped prosecuting charlatans! I will stop you. - The priest cannot and you will? I don't think you understand, Mr. Superintendent. - I am tired of your insolence. - I am tired, too: what do you want? - Excuse me, maybe this isn't the right time. - [Superintendent] I told you, it's impossible. - Who is this person? - This is Jim Martin ... from America. He... he... is here to make a study of the land and bring prosperity to our people. - So? - So listen, the location here is perfect for my work. (huffs) I just thought it'd be nice if I could rent a room for myself and my son. - This is my home. I do not rent rooms. How dare you tell him I would do such a thing? - Actually the superintendent told me there was no possibility of renting a room. I thought I'd just ask. - Oh, then you told him I would not? - Yes. - The room is yours, move in when you wish. - Thank you. (gentle music) (horse whinnying) (horse footsteps closer) (horse whinnying gently) (horse footsteps moving away) (low animal roaring cry) (laughing) - Look. Jorg, look! (laughing catcalls from the men) - [Jorg] She's got to be helped. She may get lost. What do you think, brother? Huh? - Just the witch's bitch. - Are you afraid of the witch, her mother? - [Jorg] Johann? Johann! - No. - [Jorg] No, no! I am going alone. But don't ask me later how it was. (laughing) (gentle music) (suspenseful music & footsteps.) - [Girl] Hello? Is someone there? Hello? (muffled scream) - Oof - HEY! (intense music) (horse angrily neighing) (animal's roaring cry) (animal's roaring cry) (BOOM!) (birds chirping) (bird calling) (wind chime tinkling) - Looks good. Great food here, Dad. - (cries out) Ahh! - Who are you? - Uh... I'm Jim, Jim Martin and this is my son, Steve. We're staying here for a few days. - I'm sorry. Look, look. Do not move. Pretend you're a piece of furniture. Then when I get to the table, then you can move. - Okay. - This is my daughter, Jewel. - You're blind, aren't you? - We will eat now. You will take your things upstairs later, yes? Please, to the table. - Thank you. - Come on, come on. - [Steve] Coming. - [Jim] Boy am I hungry. - I am surprised you choose to stay here Mr. Martin after all the stories I am sure the superintendent has told you. - Well I try not to listen to too many stories. Besides, it's... it's very beautiful here. And this is the best place for me to stay while I conduct my studies. - What is it exactly that you do, Mr. Martin? - Mother. - I'm a consultant. I do environmental impact studies. - Ah . - I try to protect nature. - I find it very difficult to believe that someone would come to the ends of the world, to this valley, only to protect it. - Mother, please. (laughs) - Well. It takes all kinds. (sheep bleating) (knocking) - Mr. Martin, how is it at the witch's house? When you didn't show up I thought she turned you into a chair or table or something. - You've given me all the maps... yes? - Uh, I think so. Why, anything wrong? - I'm having some trouble figuring them out. The maps aren't complete. They look like sketches. If I turned those in I'd be laughed right out of the EPA. - Okay, come to my office. Maybe I didn't give you everything. - I can't make any sense out of these. Where did you get your data? - From your company, Mr. Martin. - You must be joking, not this. - Do you suggest I lie to you? Your people were here for two months. This papers are what they give to our government. What is you don't like about it? - I don't know yet, but it doesn't all add up. I've got to make new maps. Is there anybody around here to help me update these? - Nobody here. Nobody here has learned these things. - Yes, it figures. I guess I'll have do it up myself. I'm sorry I interrupted you in your work. - [Johan] It was the witch's daughter! - [Blond Peasant] What, witch? - [Bartender] The witch: get her out of here. If not, do to her what you do to a woman! (laughing) (tutting) - This woman. A witch? - Yes, things fly. - And they also change. Butterflies. People. Horses. - You, you know. - Tell me about this witch of yours. Sounds interesting. (gentle music) - I can see why you chose this place, it's beautiful. The silence is extraordinary. (computer game beeping) - Dad, I'm bored. Let's do something. - You do something. - I have something interesting to tell. There are caves here. - Caves? - Um-hmm. - How do you know? You can't see anything. - Steve. - Sorry. - It is dark in caves, Steve. I see things my way. - Who knows what the blind can see? - Hmm. - Mr. Martin. If you are very interested in these caves, I am sure that Jewel will help you. She knows the mountain better than anyone. - There aren't any caves on my maps. - You do not believe me, do you? - I believe you. - Some are high and some are very big. Hot air comes out of one. - Is there any sort of smell that comes out of this hot air cave? - Sometimes. People call it the dragon's breath. - Dad, do they have dragons here? - Maybe it's sulfur. - It is not good to tell a child these stories before he sleeps. Jewel. Sing us a song that makes for better dreams. ♫ [Jewel] I wonder ♫ I wonder ♫ I wonder what things are like ♫ I wonder if my dreams are right ♫ I wonder ♫ I wonder ♫ I wonder what people see ♫ I wonder what makes up the key ♫ To see ♫ So there's the sun and the moon ♫ And the stars and the trees ♫ The animals in the woods ♫ There's the caves and the rocks ♫ And the foggy cool mornings ♫ The sun rising over the hill (Dragon's roaring cry) ♫ And there came a special friend of mine (suspenseful music) (Dragon's roaring cry) (echoing Dragon's cry) (echoing Dragon's cry) (dramatic music) (gentle music & chirping birds ) - [Steve] Come on, Dad. - [Jewel] Follow me, we're nearly there. - [Jewel] Steve, stay close. - [Steve] Catch up, Dad. - [Jim] Okay, okay. - It is here. - What's here? - The cave. - The cave? - Yes... the cave. - [Jim] Steve, you stay there, guard the entrance. - Okay. - [Jim] Where are we going? - Through here. - I can't see. - That is your problem, not mine. - [Jim] Amazing. How did you ever find this place? - By chance. I find everything by chance, and then I remember. Be careful and stay close. (Jim cries out) Jim! Are you alright? - [Jim] I'm alright, don't worry about me. Damn! (splashing) - [Jim] I'll be right up! - What is the matter with you? - [Jim] How do I stop from falling? - [Jewel] Everything is alright, yes? - [Jim] Everything's alright. - Oh, Jim. - [Steve] How'd you get so dirty? - I thought you could see. - You can see, Dad. - You, you just remember who feeds you. - You're gonna get in trouble. Okay, okay, okay. - I will walk around. I have to count the paces myself. - [Jim] Be careful. - No, YOU be careful. I know the way out of here, you don't. (gentle music) Steve, do you want to come? - No. - [Steve] Wow. Hey, Dad, look at this rock I found! (horse neighing) (romantic, ever-more-exciting music) (mysterious music) - So many enemies around you, Mr. Martin. Why do you come? Ah . . . So . . . Destiny plays us against each other. (gentle music) - There is something bothering you, yes? - I am trying to make up my mind about something. - [Jewel] I'm sure you will do what is right. - Steve's mother used to say that a lot. We miss her. - I miss my mother also. - I thought Alta was your mother. - Alta's not my real mother. I have been with her since I was very small, much younger than Steve. - Where's your dad? - Ever since I can remember we were always changing places. Always on the move. - How'd you end up here? - I go where Alta goes, but of all the places we have been I'm most happy here. - I don't think Alta's too happy about our being here. - People misunderstand her. They say bad things about her, but they are not true. It is just that she knows things other people do not. [Jewel] And I've had to learn things, too, in my own way. I can tell, Jim, you're a good man. (suspenseful music & heavy animal breathing) (panicked breathing) - Now . . . Take me there. (computer data beeping) - Boy. These errors in the data sent to me by my boss just can't be a mistake. Something very, very strange going on around here. Are you telling me I have to drive all the way to the capital to phone the United States? - We have no needs of telephones here, gossip is much quicker. - God, I can't believe I gotta drive 100 miles to get to a telephone. - I'm sure the superintendent will be happy to drive you. It will give him a chance to ignore his duties. - Okay, I'm gonna go down and see if he can take me now. Do you mind if Steve stays here? - It's alright, I can stay with Jewel. Okay, Jewel? - Alright. - Jewel will take good care of him. - I'll be back tonight or first thing tomorrow morning. - As you wish. - Take care, Steve-O. - Okay. - [Jim] Now you behave yourself, alright? - Yeah. - Don't pester Jewel with too many of your infernal questions. - But I gotta ask Jewel about the white horse we met. (shushing) - Come Steve. Take my hand, Steve. - Where are we going? - Into the forest. - [Steve] Is it far? - [Jewel] No, it is not too far. I want to show you something very special. - [Steve] What is it? - [Jewel] You'll see. (bird calling) [Jewel] You will like it though. - [Steve] What is it? - [Jewel] I cannot tell you yet. - [Steve] Come on. (laughing) - [Jewel] No. (suspenseful music & heavy animal breathing) (animal's crying out, echoing & panicked breathing) (Dragon's roaring cry!) (intensifying suspenseful music) (Dragon's roaring cry, echoing) (screaming) (Dragon's cry!) (echoing Dragon cries) (falling scream) (thud) - Why couldn't we tell my dad about the horse? - I thought that my mother would be angry that I rode him. You know how parents are. It is better not to say some things. - Okay. I've never kept a secret from my dad before. (gentle music) I'd sure like to ride that horse. - You're too small. - I'm not really small and anyway you're not much bigger. If you don't let me ride I'll tell him everything. - You're horrible. I never thought that a small boy could blackmail. - [Steve] I'll do anything to ride that horse! - Let's just forget about it. I don't even know if he'll show up today. Where are you going? I'm supposed to take care of you. - But I don't need anyone to take care of me. - Well we're going together anyway. - [Steve] Together? I can beat you, you know. You're just a girl. - Wait, let's bet on it. - Yeah. - I can get to the other side of the rocks first. A race! - Alright! Alright. - Come on. - I'll win! - [Steve] I'm ahead already. (Jewel laughs) - Jewel, where are you? [Steve] Jewel! [Steve] Boy oh boy! - [Jewel] Isn't he beautiful? - [Steve] Yeah. - Hello. This is my friend. You're not afraid, are you? - A little nervous. Maybe I'll ride him ... tomorrow. (horse neighing) (gasps) - You! I thought you were dead. - Disappointed? - You were to have been executed. - You could have stayed to find out. [Tai Ching] Does she know? - She thinks her mother died of the sickness. She has no idea she is the Chosen One. - 14 years to find you . . . yes? It was the only thing on my mind. So the Dragon is here. - I am not sure. - Do not deceive me again. - I am the one who has searched for the Dragon all these years, I will not give all over to you now! - I ... brought you the legend. - And I found Jewel in the stars for you. I have the girl and soon I will find the lair. I do NOT need you! - You may have found the door, but I have the key. - I do not understand. - The Dragon must be killed with a certain kind of arrow. Without it, all is lost. - What is it you want? - The original agreement. I want only the precious stones from the lair. You may take the powers of youth and immortality. My gift for your vanity. So: we are partners again. Agreed? - Agreed. Is that all? - That is never "all". (chuckles) - Well I was gone a whole five minutes, did the Roman Empire fall? - Frank, the figures on the Brazilian project don't add up, not to the quarterly report. - I'll make 'em work, I always do. - [Robert] Frank, I don't have to tell you that since my father left me 51% of the company-- - Robert, don't talk to me about my brother. - My father. He was! MY 51%! And I just have to ask "What direction the company's going in?" I mean, where's something holistic, something fun, or... you know, Uncle Frank: profitable? - Profitable is something I'm very familiar with, Robert. - Mr. Brown, you have a phone call - from Karistan. - Excuse me, gentlemen, I have to go deal with something "profitable". - Well, I hope so Frank 'cause if not we may have to vote you out at the next stockholders' meeting. - Hello, Jim! What time is it there? What are you up to? - [Jim] I've been busy up here, Mr. Brown. There's a lot of work to do. - Yeah, well what's the good word from Karistan? - Oh, it's a very pretty country. I like to think it's gonna stay that way. - What do you mean by that, Jim? - [Jim] Your reports and mine don't agree. - Well maybe your analysis is at fault. - I don't make faulty analysis. - I'm not attacking your ability, Jim. I sent you down there to do a job to verify the data and a simple report that'd be acceptable to both governments. - You come in here, this place will become a wasteland within 10 years. - 10 years is a long time, Jim. Our contract runs out in five. - The hell with Karistan, right? - You sound really tired, Jim. Why don't you just bring us the report and we'll rework it into an acceptable form? - No no no, I'm not giving you any reports. Any reports I got to give I'm gonna give it to the governments involved. - Is that your last word, Jim? - You better believe it. (bell tolling) (phone ringing) - [Woman] Hello? - Put Doc on. - [Woman] Okay. - [Doc] Hello? - Hello Doc. - [Doc] Oh, Frank, long time no see. - Got a small problem needs taking care of right away in a place called Karistan. - Hmm? - Problem's name is Jim Martin. Get on it. - Okay. Silver? Frank Brown has a little employment problem. Needs our immediate attention. - For christsakes, Superintendent, you don't have to believe me. I could be wrong, but what if I'm not? - But why? Why would your company try to destroy my country? - You really don't understand. They don't give a damn about your country. All they want to do is make money! I can't talk about this anymore. I've got a job, and I have to do it with or without you. Period. - How can I help you? What can I do? - I have to make copies of my report. - Get them to me. I will make sure they get delivered to the right hands. - Thank you. (jeep driving away) (owl hooting) - What is this Chinaman up to? - Who cares? You got your money, so do what he wants. - [Johan] What are we supposed to do? - [Blond Peasant] Shut up. Just find the blind one. - Your father, he is a good man. - Yeah. (gentle music) - Do you not think so? - But he's always getting in trouble. - [Jewel] So who takes care of him, you? - [Steve] Of course. (humming) (shouting) Let Jewel go! (Dragon's roaring cry!) - [Jewel] Steve, Steve! (Dragon growl and roar) - Jewel, it's a real dragon, a real dragon! He just wiped out those bad guys. - They could never understand us, could they? (gasp) - You have deceived me. The Dragon turns for her into a white horse. - And how do you know? - I know. - So . . . now you see all. Especially that you'll never find the Dragon alone. Is this the arrow? - This one looks the same as the others, but only one can kill the Dragon. - Which one? - The metal itself is nothing remarkable, but it must contain a certain element. And it must hit the heart at the precise moment when the Dragon is most vulnerable. It must be done in the lair. - Yes! Jewel must be sacrificed in the lair or I do not receive the gift of youth. The moment she dies the gift is mine. - The American, you must get rid of him. - Or use him. - How? - His son. Already he and Jewel speak of the white horse. Soon they will find the lair. We must only be patient. (owl hooting) (suspenseful music) - [Alta] This youth . . . is mine . . . Forever. And you. Death. Fade into the darkness. (sheep bleating) - Anything happens to that rifle, you're responsible. (funky suspenseful music) - [Superintendent] Mr. Martin. - Superintendent. - This is Dr. Lawrence Westmore, he says he is from your company. - [Jim] Doc. - [Doc] Didn't think we'd met. - [Jim] We haven't. But I've worked for companies that have bid against you. - Oh, well, we work for the same company now. - [Jim] Really? This gonna take long? - No, this won't take long at all. Excuse us a minute. - [Jim] Hey you guys, why don't you go inside for a little while? - [Steve] Come on Jewel, I wanna show you something. - [Doc] Good looking boy. [Doc] What a beautiful country this is, huh? Frank Brown has, uh, ... told me I could offer you money. The rest of your pay, as a matter of fact, in exchange for the reports. And to advise you those reports legally belong to the company. - You can always pay me, but a copy of those reports goes to the company as well as everyone else: Government of Karistan and the US government. - Well you don't even have to sign 'em, I'll fill in the final report. - It's okay. I'll sign 'em. - In what form? - In full detail. - That could be misinterpreted. I'm also authorized to double your salary. One day you're gonna go in front of a government agency, it's gonna be a day like any other day. A hearing like any other hearing. And you're gonna go in there with all your facts, your figures, your very sincere convictions. And you know what you're gonna see? A bunch of people who have already made up their minds without hearing a word you say. Why? For a piece of the pie. A new car. A vote they may want down the line, who knows? But if you're looking for somebody to fight for the future with you, don't look to those people 'cause they don't care at all. You really want to see that day? - I don't have a choice. - We all have a choice. - I don't. - Superintendent, I think I'm ready to go now. Does he know? - No. - Yes. I know everything that goes on here. - Of course. No hard feelings, business is business. (funky suspenseful music) Alright you guys know your jobs. Stay outta sight and I'll be in touch. No drinking. (keyboard clacking) - No matter how many times I put the information through this thing it still comes out with the same answer. I've been set up. - In the universal scheme we are all pawns, Mr. Martin. - Come on, lady, I don't wanna hear any more of your backwoods philosophies. - As you wish. - What the hell is this? - Probably a failure in the power. The current is not so reliable in the backwoods. - This is impossible! The memory is erased! - You have become too dependent on machines, Mr. Martin. It is good to exercise the brain as well as the finger. - Well at least we care enough about our children to see that they get an education. - Are you speaking of Jewel? - Yeah, it's great that she gets to commune with nature around here but it also might be nice if she got a chance to go to school! Had a chance to make some friends, lead some kind of a normal life. - Let me tell you something, Mr. Jim Martin. If you had clothed and fed and cared for her all these years maybe, just maybe, your opinion would be worth some value. But since you have not, I would suggest that you concentrate on putting your own life in order. - She's right. (gentle music) - Here. I baked something for you and Steve. - Thank you very much, that was very thoughtful. - It is funny. I am usually the one who is leaving. With you and Steve going, I feel as if I'm losing a part of me. I wish I could have shown more of my world to you. - You may have shown me more of your world than you think. - But why is it you have to go so soon? - I just have to, that's all. Listen. Remember when you said that you thought I would always make the right choice, right decision? - Yes. - Well, hopefully, I have. I'm afraid that means that we must go. - I understand. I will miss you. - [Steve] Jewel, come here! - Where do you think you're going? - We'll be right back. - He wants to say goodbye to a friend. - A friend? It's a lucky thing I got all these notes down on paper before the computer memory gave out. Alta? Anybody home? (suspenseful music) (gun firing) (tires screeching) (gun firing) (explosion echoing) - [Jim] What happened? What happened? Tell me, who did this? What happened? (gurgling) [Jim] Come on! - Here? Damn. Grenade. Hold on. (jeep driving away) (bird calling eerily) (flames roaring) - [Jim] Steve, Steve. (suspenseful, rising music) - [Man] Stop! (beeping) - Yeah, come in. - Hello boss, I got them. (thunk) (groans) - [Steve] Ohhhh. - Good, good boy. Now, let's go to your friend. That's right, you and her, go to your friend. Everything is fine. Good. - Alright come on, let's get out of here! Let's go, let's go, spread 'em out! Let's go, move! (funky suspenseful music) (gun firing, ricochet echoes) - Steve! - [Steve] Dad's in trouble, I better go find him! - No, no. It is okay, he will find us. (horse neighing) - [Steve] Are you scared? - Yes, a little. (horse neighs, echoing) It's alright. Here comes our friend. We're safe. (horse neighing, echoing) - [Steve] Noooo! (dragon's roaring cry) (machine gun firing) (funky suspenseful music) (machine gun firing, echoing) (other guns firing) (machine gun firing) (cries out) (splashes) (gun firing) (gun firing) - Hey Doc. Can you hear me? (beeping) - Yeah, come on in, who is it? - It's Jim Martin. - Alright, good boy Jim. (guns firing, echoing) (Machine gun firing) - Uaghh! (crashing body) - Hmm. You should have taken the money, Jimbo. (gun fires) (groaning) (twang - thunk!) - Aagh! (mystical, suspenseful music) - The time for praying is past. - [Tai] It will be done. (rock striking rock) (Dragon growling) (Dragon crying out alarm) (Dragon growling distrust) - Jewel . . . you are safe. Please come to me, I fear for you. - Do not worry, it's Alta, it's only my mother. - Come to me. - Everything's alright. Steve is here. And I'm with my friend. - [Alta] I do not trust your friend. Haaa! (Dragon roars!) (Dragon roars, crying out angrily!) (screams) Nooooo! (screams) (weaker cries of pain and age) - Jewel, no! (gentle music) - [Jim] Jewel! - I can see. I can... I can see! (laughing) I can see! Jim! (tapping) - Frank, we're already a half hour late for the press conference? - I'm waiting for that report. - Come on, Frank, this is it. Either you pull it out of the hat again - or you resign. Let's go. Come on! Let's go. - Don't worry about a thing, kid, I've got an ace in the hole. - Oh, come on, Frank, you don't have anything. - Nothing up this sleeve, nothing up this sleeve, but I AL-WAYS WIN, kid! (flashing) - Mr. Brown, Mr. Brown! - No comment. (reporters shouting) I'm afraid I can't answer that question. Sorry about that. Nothing to say, nothing to say. - My name is Jim Martin. I have a report here from Karistan. I'd like to read it to you. (cameras clicking) (reporters shouting) - [Steve] Dad? Is Jewel coming home with us? - [Jewel] Steve. - [Jim] Sure. - [Steve] Come on Jewel. We're really gonna have some fun. (upbeat gentle music)
