Unbelievable riches had accumulated over hundreds of years accumulated behind the walls of sodom and gomorrah, in these cities of sin and vice without borders. The greed for power and wealth had also gripped the desert tribes, which became more and more threatening. Your mighty leader was the prince of the Helamites. Even if so many subordinates are loyal to your prince, our attack may only take place when my horse troop has returned. Tell your prince, I'm looking forward to the day, at which we shall shed the blood of our enemies. I thank you, prince. Beware of the sodomite scouts. There she is! After her! Faster! - Faster! - Stop! Stop! - Stop! - No! - Get off your horse! Get down! - No. Who sent you to the Elamites? - Let go of me! - Who sent you? Tamar, the prince's secret messenger. She will talk. We must bring news to the prince. While in sodom and gomorrah betrayal and intrigue reigned, a peaceful people wandered through the desert, the hebrews. You were looking for pasture for your cattle and for food for yourself. The tribes of Abraham and lot were together and the country could not stand it that they dwelt together, for their number was great. Abraham said to lot: If you want to go to the left, I'll walk to the right, or if you want to go to the right, I'll walk to the left. And lot voted and went with all his people against the Jordan valley. Go back to lot, maybe he'll carry you. Oh, sir. If it is your will that my people should take this arduous journey so help me not to show any tiredness. Give our bodies strength for the future, to overcome all the hardship. First of all the thirst that plagues us. Help us, oh lord, to conquer the fear that gnaws at our hearts. The way was long and arduous. Thirst, hunger and exhaustion attacked lot's people. Hopelessness spread and sowed discord. Only the sick should drink from it, says lot. Aren't you sick, Isaac? - Are you feeling well? - Cut them open. Come on, let the cool water run over your hands, your face. - Wet your lips and mouth. - No, no, please. If lot gets angry, then you say: But, lot, I'm sick. Look, I'm dying of thirst. Here. - No. - Take it. - No, no. I beg you. - Come on. - Come on. - No. Hold on, Isaac. Stop. Please let me drink. I'm sick, lot. The water is for the sick. Please give me a drink. - Help him. - Who made him sick? Who got him so far that he can't control himself? - Lot is to blame. Let us repent. - Repent? Now that we are at our destination in a few days? Maybe in a few hours. He is incapable of leading us. We have endured enough. He's right. It is not customary to decide such questions with a weapon. Give orders that we repent. We elders have chosen lot as our guide, melchior. - You have a duty to obey. - This staff belongs in my hand. I'd better guide you. Since melchior is keen on action, he can accompany me on a corridor. We'll investigate how far we still have it. Come on, melchior. Water. Come. To drink. Wait. Where there is water in the desert, there is danger. - Back with you! - Let them come closer. - What are you doing here? - We hope to find water. There is no water in this oasis, not for 3 years. - You are the hebrews? - Yes. Our scouts have informed us of your coming. They say your men have beards but you are shaved. Why? During the period of mourning our men shave. Are you grieving? To whom? - For a favorite? - My wife. The wife. A wife is easy to replace, am I right? Where can we get water? Many are sick with thirst. Maybe they need not only water, but also salt. Salt? Salt makes you even more thirsty. It's a secret as old as our city. When one is weak and exhausted from thirst and heat, one needs salt. Unfortunately I gave away my salt for the slaves. I bought her for the queen. It cost 4 times its weight in salt. Poor creatures. Am I a poor creature too? Is your heart broken too because of me? I'm a slave too, the top of the royal body slaves. To own people as property is wrong, evil. Evil? What kind of views do you have? Where I come from, there's nothing wrong with it. Everything that gives pleasure is good. Where are you from? Not from far away. Straight ahead for a while. Sodom and gomorrah. You people of sodom and gomorrah, beware. Your sins cry out for retribution. You buy men and women as if they were made of stone. You treat them as objects of your pleasure or like machines for your work. You force them to mine your precious mineral wealth, the white salt. Just to increase the prosperity of your nefarious cities. You owe all your power and prosperity to the salt. And you buy this salt with the blood of your slaves. Listen to me people of sodom. The old fool! Shut him up! I have to warn the prince. Hey. Hey. One day they will destroy you, just as your prince would even destroy his own sister. Watch your tongue. You have publicly blasphemed the queen's brother. How can this person demand submission? How dare you speak of it? You have the monopoly on the precious raw material, which in Africa is more valuable than gold. On the salt. You use this material, in order to keep an entire continent cruelly in a stranglehold. You exchange your salt for gems, fragrances and slaves, just for the insatiable greed of your queen and her nefarious brother to breastfeed. We hurried to warn you. We were worried that we would be late. They haven't been brought here yet. It was good of you to come here immediately. I'll reward you for it. Now is the time to find other means, more effective ones. After a defeat on the battlefield they would be despised. Your assassination would be celebrated as a great deed. Whoever killed them would be the new king of sodom and Gomorranh. My sister. She imagines she can rule as well as a man. She has a cautious woman's mind. I could found a state, an empire. She's just trying to hold what we already have, our 2 united cities. - No, let go of me. - In there! There it is, stupid creature. Tamar, Tamar. Up here. Do not be afraid. I'll protect you, don't be afraid. Silence. What message did you bring me with you? That the arrival of the hebrews changes things. He thinks the time is not yet ripe. Quiet, I said. Take a deep breath. Breathe, do you hear? - He's blind. - Blind? What a nice idea. You have a delightful imagination. This makes the case more interesting. An excellent refinement, Maleb. That should loosen that faithless bitch the tongue. Do you know the name? Then your sisters will die. If you have to watch it, I'll tell him. Of all my slaves I have given you my favor. Weren't you happy? And not even grateful. What message did you bring to the Helamite camp? Since when have murderers been allowed to act as judges? Since when do traitors have the right to ask questions? Who sent you there? I want you to keep your life. What is my legacy to you and sodom? - No. - Are you insane, Tamar? Silence! Tamar? Tamar. Tamar, the slave. No, no. No! Make it short, please. You're helping me with this. Have pity on me. It will cause me less pain. Have pity, please. The name. Please, arlok. Please. She will die without speaking. Give her the rest if she doesn't speak. Talk. Tell me the name! Who sent you to the Helamites? Speak before it's too late. Speak. Ah. Ah! I have to praise you. Your wild cat gives the best testimony to your taste. Thank you, mistress. She's also proud. After you, the 1st girl who suppressed every scream. - I admire pride. - Better for her if you don't like her. If you take Tamar's example. The life prospects of your favorite slaves are exceptionally low. - You met them? These hebrews? - Mmm. My brother didn't succeed. Even so, he never tires of warning me about them. I want to know why. These hebrews cannot be trusted. They want everyone to behave as their beliefs dictate. And you tell me they are not dangerous. Dangerous? Who are they dangerous to? Us. - Didn't you say they were unarmed? - That I saw. I want to convince myself why they seem threatening to you. When my plans are ready, we will go see them. Beloved sister, I only live to obey your commands. As always, he thinks no further than the tip of his sword. He believes these people are a danger to us. But in reality your presence can be useful. Should we be attacked by the Helamites. And in peacetime they make themselves useful as slaves. - For menial jobs. - Not as slaves. Your leader lot says, no human can own another human. Whoever has no slaves must be very poor. Poor? That's right. But they seem to be ignorant of their poverty. If this lot prefers not to keep slaves, it is at his discretion. Often you can't prevent becoming one yourself. Especially when one is seduced by tricks, which are as old as sodom and as proven as Gomorranh. How often have we heard on our marketplace: The hebrews keep their word, the hebrews can be relied on. You understand, the hebrews with their newborn religion stand between the great mighty kingdom my brother dreams of and us. And between the hebrews and the rest of the world only sodom. And you, Ildith? Do you fear being my favorite too? - The Jordan. - How beautiful. This is where our faith will be put to the most severe test. No Hebrew is allowed to go into these cities, not even near them. No. Instruct that no one should cross the river. Nobody is allowed to cross the river. No one. You my two brave daughters. Our long journey is now over. Let everyone know that they are not drinking too much at once. "Lord, I thank you for our salvation and humbly ask you to show me the rest of the way." So let's go now. Ho! Forward! I think the old Alabias was still alive. What a horrible place this is. What a horrible blasphemy. Dead and dying. Bleached bones under god's bright sky, under its brilliant sun. You will be fine. We will take care of you. Here, drink. Slow down, drink. What kind of place is that? The body of the slaves of sodom and Gomorranh. With the flesh from those bones these wicked cities are built. Forward. Faster. Faster, forward. The chosen people, that's what they call themselves. Chosen by whom? Stop. You're right, Ildith. When it looks poor it is easy to think of the raw as a virtue. Or you make the mistake and think it is weakness. Melchior. Warn our people. Nobody is allowed to cross the river. You have to negotiate for us. Watch out. Don't worry. My son and I are slaves to the queen. We have orders to carry you across. - I have two legs myself. - Please. So that I can talk to you. You have no slaves? No. We are all just servants of our lord in heaven. If my son and I could flee to you, would you give us refuge? I would do that. Thank you. - Sodomite queen. - Lot. Lord of the hebrews. There is room for your people everywhere. What do you think you can find here that made you wander around? - Let the land be fertile. - For crops? - Or for your religion? - Maybe both? If this country were yours, you would be ready to fight for it? You will notice that the nomad tribes are not peaceful. We are not a warrior people, but we would fight, - to protect what is ours. - Then take possession of it. The whole Jordan valley for annual 100,000 talents of grain. For, say, 10 years. In your interest I warn you, the land is barren and arid. It is impossible for us to raise that price. 75,000 talents, no less. 50. Agreed. For, say, 7 years. I agree too. My daughter Shuah brings a present for the queen, to seal the trade. To dry your feet. I would like to give you a gift in return. - My best slave, Ildith. - But I don't want to. I'd rather die. Did I learn so much for it? To live with this pastoral people? In huts made of smelly skins? You were brought up to do what I please. I have to refuse your gift. It is against our belief to own others as property. Is it also forbidden for you by your faith to set them free? Farewell. And good luck. Hurry up. Come over. There will be trouble. The women, especially the wives, will reject this woman. She is a slave from sodom. I'll be in front of the altar of the tabernacle to point out the duty to hospitality. Thank you. We dressed them as you ordered. She is dissatisfied with the clothes, but she'll get used to it - how we all got used to it. - Thank you. As you ordered. Well? Don't you even want to admire your work? A noble robe and so supple to the skin. Do you like it better than the silk robe? For the purpose it's supposed to serve, yes. For what purpose? A bird has colorful feathers to attract others. Look at that! - I think you will agree with me. - Not at all. Women wear clothes as protection from the sun, from the cold. That explains the shape of your clothes. You hebrews confuses clothes with tents. You sit loosely so that it does not interfere with your work. - Which one? - Women's work. Cooking, spinning, cleaning, work in the fields. - And you say you are against slavery? - That's the way it is. Nevertheless you ask me to do work, which I had never to do before. Work is the price of freedom. The work for yourself. If you decide for yourself what and where you want to work. This is what really sets you free. If that means a sunburned face cracked hands, dirty, rough clothes like this, I'd rather be a slave then. Me too, if it it means delicious smells and silk clothes. Just feel it. Soft like angel wings. And those lovely shoes. You will need them. How can you show yourself like that. What would your mother have said? What would she have said if she had seen the woman in our tent? We know why you recorded it. A man who has lost his wife, - doesn't have to be ashamed about it. - Insolence. You forgot that your father is the master. I've learned that the lord never does anything wrong. Run, run! Come over we will protect you! - Stop the sodomites. Save the slaves. - Ah! The network, the network! Get out of here! Get lost! Come on. Wait. Give us refuge. Protect us. Hand over our slaves. At the word of your sister this is our country. - Hand them over. - No. Stop. Stop fighting. Ishmael. Do you want to kill a defenseless man? Is that what you want? So. Help him. Tell your queen we will take care of her brother, until he is ready to return alone. Bring him to our tent. Tell her too that these men are now free. You are under our protection. Now leave our country. - Back to sodom. - The sodomites will never forgive you for that. We need not fear them. We are servants of the lord. We are here on his behalf. You should be scared. The elders and lot pray to jehovah. They ask for help with what we are doing. Better to pray for swords, Spears and lances. You don't get it. The sodomites are your enemies. Dangerous, unscrupulous. Be careful with this man, no matter how sweet his words are. You have to be vigilant. You think of me a lot, Shuah. Right? No. Not even at night? Not at all. Admit it. You think of me a lot. Is my skin still as soft as on that 1st day, that you anointed me? Does my hair still smell that sweet? Does your hand still shake when you touch me? My father has given orders to take care of you. I obey him, nothing more. Not even at night? Tent walls are thin, and you don't sleep far away. I hear you. What you said in a dream, was very enlightening. What did I say? - What did I say? - Should I repeat it? Shall I? Why aren't you like everyone else? What is it? Your skin? The scent of your hair? Why am I doing this? Why can't I stop feeling this way? To stop feeling means to die. You're too young for that. Think about your dream again. The answer lies in it. He didn't tell you that he wanted to leave? - No. - Why should he? You have just been been a pastime. You know what Ildith looked like when she came to us. These are the women he's used to. So it will be wide enough. - So he would have to withstand. - How long will it take us? When our men work like Eber we're ready for spring ordering. A surprise for the queen of sodom. How delighted she will be when it turns green and sprouts. The land of hope for every slave in sodom. Do you know those roots? You can find this plant all over the mountains. If you cut it, juice will come out, which we use to color our nails, like now. See? The more you take the darker the color. - What's going on here? - The girl has feet like an animal. - I showed her something. - I can see that. Shuah. It's late. Water the cattle. My father doesn't want me to be attractive. Why can't Maleb water the cattle? Should she do your work in addition? Now go on. My daughters are beautiful enough as nature created them. You don't need any decorations. Perhaps it's the most refined nothing to be done. This brown, wind-tanned skin is probably exercising has a very special charm. - Of which we in sodom just have no idea. - Do you think? Oh. A Clay floor also has advantages. It would have broken on marble. This is strange. Huh? Show your other hand. Let's go to the light so I can see it better. These are not the hands of a farmer. Why not? These are the hands of a great man. Your lifeline is long and clear. My lifeline is short. I.e. I will die young. Do you believe in things like that? Why? Not you? We believe that only god knows our future. This belief gives us the power to move mountains. Soon you will see what our faith can do. He's transforming this whole country. When you see this structure growing towards the sky, you will share our faith one day. - After that nice speech, you want to sleep outside now? - No. In ishmael's tent. I should have figured that out. It's warm and comfortable here. Too comfortable maybe. You must be a good example to the men of the tribe. Even if you wanted to stay here, you wouldn't dare. Good night. You are much more a slave to your faith than any slave in sodom. Although your visit came as a surprise, prince Astaroth, we have still brought about this modest show of our foot and horse troops. It is certainly not to be called humble. The elite from all of my desert tribes. Watch the cavalry troops ride through the warriors. An example of good horse control. The attack of a well-led cavalry force beats the best foot troops. You're supposed to ride for another hour. - I don't understand why you are not acting. - Patience. - Your sister has new allies. - Allies? The hebrews live in tents of skins, the men are unarmed. You would even have taken the queen's brother off the horse. Coincidence. They are a peaceful people. Anyway, I want to get an idea of myself first from this peaceful people. Every thing needs the right time. I have trained leopards. After pulling on the halter I can judge when the animal is ready to jump. This moment has not yet arrived. I'll wait. To me. Ah. Please, please. You promised me one. You are way too slow. That's it now. - Have you seen my brother? - No, my mistress. Well, in a nutshell. We must always be ready and bring more and more fighters to our side. If the attack occurs, we must stab in the back of the forces of the queen. What a pretty sight. How pleased is my heart, so many of my loyal subordinates. So convinced of our warlike strength to see that they can afford to spend their time playing my father's favorite game. And so sensible. You play in front of your remains. With this you prove him and our other ancestors an extremely dignified and tasteful honor. Get out! We weren't idle. No? A little more precisely, please. Have your confidants established - what pleasure hebrews seek in this quarry? - Yes. Before you came I said that these granite blocks, that have troubled us are destined for a temple, with whom they want to make their god friendly. I want to know exactly. Here, your first request for salt. You have to sign a deposit for every grain. You may find some useful help in Ildith. Ask her what the hebrews build. A visit to the Hebrew camp? How pretty. Yes, lot's young daughter. There are times in which I envy you men for your freedom of action. - For nothing else? - For many things. Like you, you alone, maybe you know very well. The brother is cute, oldest and dearest of my enemies. - That was down to the blood. - Here. You no longer enjoy it. Not even pain. Go! Carry out my orders. Anything you want sweetest sister. Ah. The sodomites believe we are building a temple in honor of Jehovanh. For jehovah? No. My one pagan temple, I fear. For fertility. Come on, come on. We bring the salt your leaders asked for. We also bring things that will make your life easier. Soft sleeping beds and blankets made of wool. Metal bowls and ornate ornaments, with which you can make your hut more beautiful than that of your neighbors. Good afternoon. Aren't you happy to see me again? Tell me, does this lot dislike you? As far as I can tell, yes. Good. What do the hebrews build? I have had no reason to find out. - It's your job. - Why? Tell me that. You are only here to keep your eyes open for us and to seduce lot into our habits. To convert him. How Malek converts women to our ways. Tell your sister, I don't know anything. If I knew something I'd keep it to myself. You know my sister doesn't appreciate unkind words very much. She sent me away. I do not belong to your sister any more. I'm free. I can do what I like. I belong to myself. Congratulations on this possession. Shuah. The bird you are looking for is in hiding. In the tall reeds. Thank you. There is something touching about your loyalty to lot. Are you hiding from me? Am I a stranger? Are you angry because I left without saying goodbye? You don't want to show yourself. Good. That makes the game more exciting. I have to find your lead. You leave traces, on purpose. You want it that way. So that I can follow you. And find you. Even for a mediocre hunter it's easy following a trail in the reeds, best Shuah. You know that very well. I'll find the lead. And I'll find you. What do you need so much for, melchior? Why so much? - You wanted me to find you. - No. - You wanted it. Admit it. - No, no. Salt is meant for everyone. It's free. Like the air, like the water. On behalf of the elders, Nako will sign for all of us. And you, go now. - Go! - Ah! Lot! Lot! Lot! Astaroth, Shuah, I wasn't vigilant. Forgive me. Down by the reeds. - Leave me. - Why don't you want to? - Am I being too gentle with you? - No. You dog! Get out of here. Leave me my pleasure or die. So kill me. You will not return to sodom alive. No! - You want me to spare him? - Yes. For your daughter's sake I'll spare you. So our calculation is smooth. At our next meeting there will be no more consideration. Grace is not given. No mercy is asked. If you touch my daughter again once, I say, by Jehovanh, I will kill you. - Lot, look. - What kind of riders are they? - Nomads. Helamites. - Perhaps you will see it now. You'd better get out of here. We will convene the council and prepare. Our watch is over. Fine, Sarah. - Are the backup guards on duty? - As you ordered. - On all peaks within earshot of each other. - Good. We haven't seen anything in days. You have to give that to the devil, or the she-devil. She worked like one of us this week. What a week proves. They are watching us. I better go. Wait. Look at him. Soon she will have him sweep out her tent. Leave him alone. Lot. Lot, wait. I have to ask you something. It's about Maleb and me. - We would like to get married. - Getting married? Not immediately, of course. In about 6 months. Ishmael. When a man and a woman love each other, they should not live apart for too long. I have reasons to wait. My share of the harvest, a new household must be started. You have my blessing. Go and give her a kiss. - You shouldn't have followed me. - No? Not in my own tent in broad daylight? That's it right now. All these women by the river. In 10 minutes you will know in the camp. The breath of annoyance. - You have a low opinion of me. - Do you think so? You make no distinction between me and my office. Lot, the leader of the tribe would never do this or that. Neither does man lot. Now the man lot is standing in front of you. His heart pounding like a stupid boy. He didn't want to go into the tent, but his feet carried him. Lot. Sun. Let me know everywhere in the camp. Must I fail what is taken for granted by other men? Yes, you have to. - You must remain a good man to your people. - A good one? Why not a gloomy one, grayer, older, more boring? That's not what I meant. What does being a good man have to do with that I'm with you in my tent please, lot. Please. Has it anything to do with the fact that you think I'm a good man and you're not a good woman. Because you used to live in sodom? You can't even imagine life in sodom. This is over. It has nothing to do with the now. Look at those hands. Furrowed, sunburned. These are not the slave's hands given to me. These are the hands of a woman who was born again. You don't know if it really is. I don't know. The hands of the woman who is now. The woman, who shall become my wife. Very well. Why not? I am brought up to give joy and to obey. I can give you joys that you have never dreamed of. Ildith. In sodom, we had fragrant baths. Will you forgive me if I come to you like this? Without a beguiling scent? And what a shame that you took my pretty dress away from me. I would really like to be beautiful for you. But maybe, I am enough for you? You may not even miss the finer points? I'm not looking for pleasure in you. I want your love as I give you mine. You mustn't love me. - I want to make you my wife. - You mustn't love me! - You mustn't love me! - Why not? - I don't know. - My dear wife. Not because of the things I've done. Because of what I may do. Maybe I will never believe in this Jehovanh. You will. - Maybe I'll never be happy in clothes like that. - You will. Maybe something in me will give us away. And I will wish to live in sodom again. I'll take it seriously. Why are you bothering me? What do you have to tell me? Isn't one favor always worth another? Didn't melchior show you the way to lot's daughter? I intend to do more favors to you. Maybe you don't care, as the first hebrews who wanted to become a citizen of sodom. Services rendered are remembered with benevolence. Future services we will know how to reward. We welcome you to our walls. Open the gates. - Melchior betrayed us. - Do you have anything else to say? Nothing about sodomites, but much about hebrews who betray us. - Jehovah will cast you out. - Hollow words of an arrogant religion. I would think you guys are crazy I would not have seen what you built. Help, help me. Help me. Let go of me. No! No! Leave him alone! We are not slaves. No! You've been so smart, so smart. You set a trap and trapped yourself in it. You persuaded the hebrews to pay dearly for a desolate piece of land. What now? With this dam that they built this worthless piece of land will bring in so much that they will have paid for it in 2 years. Now the time is working for you. My most gracious sister. But melchior brought other news too. Well. That lot should intend to marry Ildith. You don't think it's important? It proves to me that the leader of this invincible people. Is not that insurmountable. Time works for me. Speak. Gentlemen, the leader of the hebrews, lot, is waiting with a group of his advisors. They wish to speak to you. I'll talk to him, but alone. This is great. He gives himself into your hand. In one fell swoop we can take down lot. Without their ruler the people are helpless. And sodom will be without allies. Your eagerness to serve me moves me. Put down your gun and wait outside. Why do you always have to treat me like a child. I want to be alone with lot! My brother is having a fit of hurt pride. Please don't put anything on it. - You want to reclaim melchior? - I don't care about traitors. But where are the former slaves, that you kidnapped with his help? For a clear head - and to calm your nerves. - Where are they? I want them back. It is our pleasure to please you. Allow us to make you comfortable. You're wasting your time. I'm not here to be drowned in wine. I am the leader of the hebrews. I'm here to discuss important matters with the ruler of the sodomites. Leave us alone. You want that I do not speak as a woman, but as the ruler of sodom? Then speak as the leader of the hebrews and not as a self-appointed prophet of an imaginary deity. Let's tear off our masks. Do you want to see the slaves that we took back? Come on. Where does he ride to with such a grim face? Wherever he may go he will not like it. Our great general's wrath is aroused. None of the sinners can evade them. A man in the free country is a free man. If this is not so, we are not masters of the land. In that case we will move on. Who told you that I wasn't indifferent? - Maybe Ildith? - Nobody told me that. Back then you asked if we would be ready to fight for this country. Since then I've assumed that our presence fits into your plans. But maybe I was wrong. Wait, lot. I can afford to be generous. The 3 recaptured slaves are to be released. - You may go back to the hebrews. - Yes, my lady. And our right to give refuge? If you insist that it belongs to the acquisition of the land, that too. Earlier you refused to drink with me. Let's drink now to celebrate the covenant between the good two enemies. We're enemies, aren't we? Our peoples, no. Our philosophies of life, yes. Have you discovered a lack of courage? Say your opinion openly. Nothing but bravery. Hot blood. I congratulate you. But if it is to be done it must be done now. You never asked me for my price. I know everything has its price. For years we nomadic tribes hat to pay terrible tributes for the salt of sodom. Now is our time. Half of sodom's total gain in salt. Ok. The leopard is pulling on its halter. If I let go of him, you have to take care of the Booty within the walls. My sister? My sister. I've waited a long time for such a hunt. I'm so glad you became my father's wife. Thank you. Let me be the first to bring you bread and the salt of life. - Congratulations, lot. - Thank you. You and Maleb, you are next. - Live happily. - Thank you. - Good luck from the heart. - Become happy together. My lucky comb. Do you remember how he helped me catch you? Don't lose him, Ildith. The Helamites! Ildith, lead the women and children to sodom. Demand shelter for them. Calm down. Calm down, keep calm. We knew that this could happen. We promised that we would defend this land, our country. We are prepared, so arm yourselves. Each go to his post. Hurry up. Who knows how fast they are here. It is better we can wait for her in peace. Nobody can know when you are here. They're still over an hour away, calm down. Everything is going as lot planned. Didn't we practice all of this enough? Quiet. Trust in god, friends. I'm so sorry on your wedding day. Quiet, Maleb. What should the other women think? He's coming back. Shuah, you and your sister, - you help Ildith with the women and children. - Yes. My two daughters will follow you as if you were their mother. We have to act. The Helamites are only five miles away. As agreed, you are under lot's command. Attack! May I suggest that our most trusted subordinates with your departments keep the town occupied? As her queen's bodyguard. As you mean. Select them. Let them into town. The men for your protection ride into the field. Since they are the most reliable, we have given them this honor. Then may I ask you to cite them. You will serve where I please. Here. By my side. For my personal protection. Forward. Attack the Hebrew camp! Death to the hebrews! Destroy your camp! Death to the hebrews! Our Hebrew allies aren't even fighting for their camp. The hebrews are gone. You are gone, escaped. We'll find them. Even in sodom the sodomite cavalry is known for their betrayal. - I hope it isn't too important. - We'll keep it in reserve. If we're lucky we don't need them. Lot! Lot! The Helamites have destroyed our camp. Tents, grain, everything burned. Our men are all in their places. Done. Suppose the Helamites are not doing us a favor, to attack where we want. We have decoys for that. Give the sign that they are coming towards us. The hebrews! Like rats, so they run into their canyons. Prisoners are not taken! The watchword of the day is: Death to the hebrews! Oil! - Into the hiding places! - Into the hiding places! - Into the hiding places! - Into the hiding places! As you can see, my friend, they are prepared. Back! Return! All back! Ah! Ah! Ah! Help! Your prince's allies appear to be trapped. The key to this trap is up there. If we turn this around, we'll reverse the course of the battle. You take this container, I take the other. Drive them out! Forward! Ishmael! Get back! Get back, Helamites! Save yourselves, Helamites! Get back! Return! The fire, it's going out. See what happened. Melchior, come back! Come here, you traitor. - Come back! - Ah! Ah! Help me! Help me! I don't hear your voice. Dead people cannot speak. Help me! Ah! They're going to slaughter us. Order the withdrawal. Our men have to stop them. So that we can buy time to break the dam. - The dam? - No, lot, no. It is the only hope for the future of our people. What else can we do? Nothing. We gave our word. Command our people to fight until they hear the horn. When they hear the horn, they should withdraw. The way is clear! Forward! You and your men are defending the southern front, I defend this one. Help the hebrews! I'll take command. Retreat. Retreat! Retreat, sodomites! Return! Return! Keep fighting until you hear the horn. Follow them. They withdraw like rats. Chase them! Destroy them! Eber, try to break through the middle section of the dam. We'll hold them for as long as possible. Go, Eber, go. Run, run! Everyone upstairs! - Does everyone know what to do if he blows the horn? - Yes. They're going to drown us. Let the men dismount. Dismount! Forward! Hold on, hold on. 1st group forward. - Attack on the dam from the south. - Attack on the dam from the south. Forward. Group attacks from the north. Unmounted forward. Spread out. Clean up the ravine. Ah! Ah! Break through the ropes. Break through them. Come on, punch them through. Let's go to the top! Hurry up! Back, back. Your message? Victory. Triumphant victory. Dangerous. That's what you called the hebrews. My dear bodyguard. Have you not been privileged to protect me? Get water and bandages for the wounded. Between sodom and the world. Hebrews only. Quiet! The queen wants to speak to you. Hebrews and sodomites, I greet you. Our city's hospitality awaits the winners. You too, brave lot, and all your people. The city awaits you with food and drink and with everything brave men dream of. Charities. Mild sheaves from the sodomites. We can take sodom and free the slaves. Give us the order to attack and we'll burn sodom to the walls. No. We'll have to accept it. We have no other choice. Hear me, queen. We accept the hospitality offered to us. But only until our burned down camp is rebuilt. Come on. I'll take care of the wounded. "0 lord Jehovanh, give me a sign, that I have done well in your face. That I made the right choice. Show me the right way and show me what to do, to serve you humbly. - Where can we get water? - Maybe there. Try this, I'll look here. Maleb. Our work is ruined. Washed away by the same water, which we believed would be a blessing to us. This water will grow new fruit. Lot. The water. - Salt. - This land is cursed. I don't think so. I don't think so at all. A mountain of salt. The flood and a landslide exposed the salt. Nothing grows on our soil anymore. All of this is on our land. What use is water to a land that is poisoned? Death. - Better we go back to where we came from. - No. We will accept the offer. We will live in sodom. Separated from them, but within the walls of their city. Live in sodom? That is the sign I asked for. Jehovah has chosen me to lead my people away from the fields. We're going to trade. Weigh honestly, measure well. The sodomite tyranny is over. Merchants who avoided sodom will come. We'll have paid our land in a year. What are we going to sell? Salt. And so it happened that the hebrews lived within the walls of sodom and Gomorranh. You had given up your simple life as farmers and Shepherds and had become a salt trader. - To pay for our land or for you? - To free slaves. Quiet please. It is the hour when judge lot will hold his midday meal. Come back tomorrow. He will listen to your concerns. Lot never used to stop working just to eat. The hardworking tastes better with a crust of bread than a rich meal for the lazy. Lot said in those days that salt was as free as air. Now we're going to sell it for gold. The tax I collected in one day. This is how we pay the queen our land. We sell so much because we ask a fair price. The sodomite slaves are whipped for it. You have to work faster and faster. Lot has won a great victory. Now he brings you riches, us righteousness. Could it be that we sodomites think more of him than you do? - We admire your lot. - You admire him. We love him. Our love obliges us to remind him that he is a servant of jehovah. - Your anger is immeasurable, ishmael. - How else is anger supposed to be? If you could say what you hope to achieve with such ruthless trade. Don't you get it, it can't go on like this. You mean we should openly break with the sodomites? - They wouldn't know. - What is it about? We have the queen's word, that in Hebrew dwellings every slave enjoys protection. You are going to cheat the queen of her property? Property. Are flesh and blood, people suddenly your property? How have you changed. I am a man of peace. I must respect the way of life of my neighbors. What they have acquired we cannot steal. If we do our presence loses any moral basis. The reason for our presence is to free the slaves. We are in sodom to win the people over to decency. While slaves perish? You should know what it means to be a slave in sodom. Tell him! A work slave? What do I know. I've never been anything like that. I believe your freedom is not that important like our peace with sodom. Ishmael, I command you to do nothing without my consent. Then why do we live here? Is it that hard to understand? If we continue to rise in the respect of the sodomites, one day we shall obtain everything by law, rightfully. You would put all of that at risk through a rash act. They change us more than we do them. Their depravity infects us. Look around here. Your clothes, this food, this house. We live in a nicer house, because the elders wished it. And Shuah, who paints her face, and barely comes home? And my Maleb, who avoids my gaze. - Is that true? - Shuah spends her time like other girls. As for Maleb, if you thought of them as much as you thought of the slaves, if there were no difficulties between you. How can you judge innocence? If you want to accuse me or my wife of any wrongdoing, bring it before the eiders. The elders. Forgive him. He's angry with me. He doesn't realize how close we are to success, without us having to use force. - Did lot hear you? - Heard yes. That's all we expect. He refuses to act. The queen once told me between the hebrews and the world there would be only sodom. Do you think so too? Yes, I do. Who do you think is the most powerful Hebrew right now. My uncle, Abraham. And should you convert sodom, who would be the most powerful then? Lot. I would be so proud of you. - Proud? - Mhm. If that happened then it would be jehovah's will. I'm nothing more than his tool. His tool? No. It would be the credit of loft, the man. You still don't understand. You lack true faith. That all the great things that you do are not your credit and you owe it only to this invisible jehovah? There are sure to be times when you know whose achievement it really is. Does your former slave confuse you? - Does she annoy you? - No. But I care about you. If we should face hardship and dangers again, then you are lost without faith. Then I'll be lost. I can't believe in something that I can't see. Hardship and poverty I'll never endure again. I know that, never again. But I don't need that either. Because you protect me. Isn't that enough for now? That I believe in you? Your sister Maleb. No. No. No, I just don't think so. Because it makes you angry. Because of this? Maleb is too young, too innocent. Too cute to be so spoiled. As I was. Younger yes. And maybe, maybe too sweet. You are lying. If that's true, if you loved her too, - why should you tell me? - Why not. Didn't I succeed to make you jealous? Just admit it. You're jealous. If only I knew. If only I knew. - What difference does it make? - She's my sister. Well then. Then you now have even more in common. Also with the other Hebrew who treasures our sodom, your father. My father is good. - He is perfect. - Did I say something else? He married a woman of ours. Led your tribe into town. What makes you different from him? Or Maleb. Or me. Do I remember your father? Captain. Step closer. Do you prefer the captain? He's very beautiful. Right? Would you rather kiss him? Come on. Don't be afraid. Come on. Kiss him. Go ahead. Isn't she beautiful? Answer me. Come on, take her in your arms. Answer me. I thought years of loyalty to you deserves at least respect. Respect for a hypocritical dog that wags its tail? He goes and thinks he's betraying me. The queen already knows everything. I'm close to death. Those tears. For you or me? For Maleb. I'll make you very happy tonight. Look, the dancer here. - The one next to it is better. - The other one is more graceful? Give me some rest. Pay attention. Silence please. I ask for silence on the queen. My loyal subjects, old citizens of this city and new ones. On the faithful keeping of the word of the hebrews, which is confirmed to us once again today. By making the final payment on their land. To your great esteemed colonel, lot. The first against the Helamites, the first in righteousness, whom I hereby appoint as my personal advisor. To the highest dignitary of sodom. My eternal gratitude to the queen of sodom. To peace and friendship. May she rule forever between the sodomites and the hebrews. Just like the queen over both peoples. - Are the guards. - Shh. - How many are guarding the camp? - 2. The slaves are ready. Make way. The gates open inward. Back. You won't get out like that. Make way! Return! Make way! Move out of the way! Push them back! Ishmael, this way! If I were to do you an important service, would you give me the position that was due to me back? How about you do me the service and then ask? There was a time your wife was such a good dancer too. Slaves, escaped slaves! The slaves broke away. - This way. - They're going to Rob us. Quickly to your houses. Hurry up. - Not here. - Take us in! Hebrews, help us. They are killing us. Let us in. Let's get in. They're killing us. They kill us. - We're trapped. - You have to let us in. Arrest them. They are trying to free slaves. - Tell them to be silent. - Listen! Listen! Silence please! A couple of ex-slaves have attempted to help their friends to escape. Don't worry. Thanks to the loyalty of our new Hebrew citizens they and their treacherous patrons could be caught. Show them in. Forward! - Get the fire wheel ready. - No, lot, help us! No! As the leader of the hebrews I invoke our right to give refuge. Your people have refused them refuge. They slammed the doors before us. They have turned us over to the guards. That man over there is a Hebrew. If he broke the law, I claim the right to punish him. Whatever you want. Into jail. - He may wait what lot decides. - No! I want to stay with them. I want to stay with them. And as for the others, your punishment will be a welcome relief for us. Save us, lot. Neither I nor my people approve of such a spectacle. Maybe you will ask your people first. I don't hear any protest. They seem to think that the sentence is deserved. - Take them away. - Rise up, hebrews. You are stronger than them. Don't let it happen. Rise up. Save the slaves. Save them! - Save them! - What are you waiting for, lot? Save them. Lot, save us. Don't watch them kill us. Lot, save us. Help us, lot! Hebrews, help us. Hebrews, do not let them kill us. How can you expect them to defend slaves? If you know that you do not even defend the virtue of your family? Your wife, your wife, which has been one of ours and will be again. She knew it, but she kept it from you. Don't listen to him. He grudges you the queen's esteem. He's going to set a trap for you. She protects your daughter Shuah. You vowed to kill the man who stole her innocence. I'd do it. Then kill me. Read the truth from her face. And the other one, Maleb, that you think is an innocent angel, avenge her too. Stop! A fight of equal value. Is more entertaining. Don't do it, lot. They're just trying to challenge you. Spare me, lot. In the name of your god, spare me. No, father, no! I am to blame for everything. Let him live! Let him live. No! How could you? You could have spared him, all right, but you didn't. You didn't do it. Shuah, don't cry. I won. I promised you I would die in your arms. - Remember? - No. You mustn't die. I won't let that happen. Congratulations, lot. How delicious it is to kill. To see how life flows out of the body. And knowing I did that. Why? Why! He begged for mercy! Did he have mercy on you? Or with Maleb? In the name of jehovah I punished him, in jehovah's name you also led us through the desert. In jehovah's name you brought us to sodom too. You wanted to flatter your vanity. Your arrogance. But he did believe that jehovah had hallowed his sword. And he would have the right to kill an evil man. He had the right. As the highest dignitary of sodom he is the law. What about the Helamites? The Helamite warriors were already defeated, but you destroyed the dam and drowned them down to the last man. You murdered them. In the name of justice. And in the name of your god, you gave yourself over to the bloodlust with zeal and lust. You are a real sodomite, lot. Welcome. No. - No. - Take a look at your hebrews. Take a look at them. Behind the exciting pleasure of killing the pleasure of watching is coming soon. You enjoyed every moment of the bloody spectacle. You have converted the chosen people, lot. To sodom. I killed. What does Hebrew law say about this? Don't fall into her trap. Be careful. How would you judge such a murderer judge lot? Now speak, judge lot. We wait for your words. I would sentence him to the dungeon. For the rest of his life. Don't be thrown into the dungeon. Fight. Fight, lot. Your people want to help you. Believe me, they will help you. Justice is an empty word. Fight if you love me. Don't you understand, you had the right to kill him. If you love me I beg you. Fight. Don't you understand? You don't understand. Lot. Lot. Lot, lot. What happened? Why are you here? What did they do to you? Lot! Lot! No! No! No! Faster! More quickly! O lord god jehovah. Help me. How could I get so lost and cause so much damage? Where I only wanted good. I have tempted my people, that no one can resist. I did that with your name on my lips. But in my heart there was pride. And now it's too late. The queen is right. If we're all as sinful as she says, let's destroy one another, for we're not worth it. May we be wiped out from the face of the earth. I ask you, my lord and god: Is there nothing in our hearts of yours? Answer me. If there's anything else in us fighting for life, in the midst of death and damnation, give him your ear. Speak to me, jehovah. Let me know if we are worth surviving. Do we have a right to live? We're bringing you a message. Jehovah's wrath is upon these cities, for they have corrupted his chosen people. In their sinfulness would sodom and gomorrah bring death and perdition to all of god's creatures. You have to go away. Lot. You have to lead your people away from here. At sunset will be the lord's vengeance and destroy sodom and gomorrah and everything that lives there. I fervently thank jehovah for finding us worth saving. To be his tool on earth. But will the lord destroy all the sodomites? All? Guilty and innocent? The innocent had enough time to stand up against the guilty, and have not done if. But jehovah is gracious. Should he find 50 righteous here, does he not spare the place for their sake? Then look for these 50 righteous ones. If there are that many among the sodomites. 40 for sure. Jehovah does not destroy 40 righteous people with sinners. Not even 30, but not 20 or 10. If I can make it, among the sodomites there are only 10 righteous found before sunset, wouldn't he spare the rest? Jehovah will spare all others for the sake of 10 righteous people. But if the 10 do not exist, he will born these cities with everything that is in its walls to the ground. Remember, lot. If some of those that you take away will look back... Jehovah knows that they regret to live in sodom. And he will destroy them. Don't let anyone look back. Nobody. I thank you for your grace, jehovah. Lot. Where are you? Ishmael? Lot. You mustn't stay in jail. You are our leader. Say what to do. A miracle, I'm free. See. My chains have fallen off. I'm free. Lot too. He saw the miracle. See his face. His eyes. Let's not talk about miracles, we want our leader back. Lot, you mustn't leave us. I have sinned. In my arrogance I wanted to punish myself. But now I know someone else is going to punish me according to his will. Melchior. We have to get out of this place. - Isn't it better to stay? - No. But we wanted to convert the sodomites. Hold on, on behalf of the queen. Let us through. Now don't be a fool. - I have my orders. - He's going to kill you. In the name of Jehovanh. My eyes! My eyes! We must tell our people what we saw. Stop it. - Stop the wheel. - Stop the wheel. They are dead. The pleasure is over. Make way for the noble judge. Or should it just start? Friends. Hebrews. These cities are cursed. We have to leave before the sun goes down. Guard. - Get hold of this man. - No. Make way for him. Let him speak. This will be entertaining. Lot, what do you think of the fire wheel? These cities will disappear from the face of the earth. Crumble to dust. Hebrews, listen to me. I brought you here and tolerated that you were corrupted by an evil people. But the lord in his mercy wants to save us one more time. Come on, follow me. Get out of this awful place. A miracle. You have to believe. Look, the sun, it's already low. We only have so much time left until it goes down. Why not burn him? He's insane, insane. He can't harm us. You citizens of sodom and gomorrah. If there are 10 of you who come with us, at least 10, then jehovah will show mercy for their sake and spare their cities. Only 10. 10 who still believe in life. And not death. Don't laugh. I beg you, follow me. Avenger of my lost innocence. Now jehovah's personal ambassador. Be glad he's free. A man like lot goes unusual ways. Who knows what he's really thinking what he's really up to? You, come with me, before it is too late. Leave me alone. Can't you see that I am comfortable here? God offers you the last opportunity to turn his anger away from you. Renounce your unnatural pleasures. - Come on! - Lot? You defeated the Helamites, freed me from my brother, and now you want to leave? Want to leave sodom, which is richer in salt than it was when you arrived? Please, go. If 10 of my people want to go with you, they should do it. Avoid torture. Think for the good of your people. What you call sin is virtue to me. The mighty death that you detest is my friend. I have my back on you, lot. You and your feeble god. Clouds, lightning. You teach your people to fear such cheap miracles. My people don't leave sodom out of fear. But for faith in god. Faith in him who is mighty enough to appear to us in the shadow of a cloud. Whose voice in the thunder can speak to us. Take a long look at this sun. - You'll never see her again. - Not until tomorrow morning. Follow me. Hebrews, have faith. Pray. Listen to the elders. A hot wind from the desert. A storm is approaching. This is going to be beautiful. Come with me. Follow me. Is it true that sodom is going to be destroyed? I only passed on what I was told. A message I've been waiting for a long time. Come on. Follow the eiders. Goodbye. Goodbye. Our people are waiting. We must join them. Maleb. Maleb. Shuah, I have a lot to make amends. I will do what I can. Only now please obey me. - Go with your sister. - I'm going. I'm going. Because I will wait for the rest of my life to hear you scream how I screamed. I want to see you crushed on the ground, crawling. Until I see this, I won't leave you. Father. I did not set myself free, jehovah did. Only he can overcome sodom and gomorrah. Come. Just so you know that everyone will know. That it is lot who does good. That it is lot who has courage. Come. Hear me out. Listen to me. As I was told, I will tell you now. When we're out of town, don't look back. When any of you look back at sodom then jehovah knows that he is sorry to give up life in sodom. And he will destroy him. Let nobody look back. Nobody. - Tell everybody, mouth to mouth. - Nobody is allowed to look back. Tell everyone backwards. Don't look back. Back! Return! Get back! Close the gates! Back! You are all free people now. Come on, join us. Look! A miracle. Opened by invisible hands. It was jehovah's hand. Jehovah has opened the gate for us. - The lord is with us. - A miracle? No, it was the wind. The wind pushed open the gate. Don't look back. Don't look back. Go on. Run! Run! Lot, wait for us! Come on. Ildith, what have you got? - I can't believe it. - You have to. - I can't. - Yes, you have to. - I've tried. - Believe. To the left. Left. It's just a bad storm. Nobody needs to be afraid. Ah! An earthquake. We've had that before. Stay with your queen. Ah! You should stay! You stay here! Where do you want to go? Do you want to hide? Ah! Don't look back. Remember lot's words. Lot's name should be on her lips. They have to thank him for all the good that happened to them. There is no jehovah. Ildith, don't look back. No! Ildith! No. No. Ildith! My father. Come, father.
