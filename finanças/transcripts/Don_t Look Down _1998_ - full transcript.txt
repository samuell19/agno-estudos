RACHEL, CARLA'S BEST FRIEND AND SPICE TO HER LIFE. TWO YEARS AGO, WHEN WE GATHERED HERE, WE BADE FAREWELL TO THE PARENTS OF RACHEL AND CARLA. TODAY, TRAGICALLY, WE COME TO BID FAREWELL TO RACHEL. IN A MOMENT, HER MORTAL DUST WILL JOIN THAT OF HER PARENTS ON THE LAKE, EVEN AS HER SOUL JOINS THEIR SOULS IN HEAVEN. CARLA HAS ASKED ME TO READ NOTHING GOLD CAN STAY BY ROBERT FROST AS SHE SCATTERS THE ASHES ON THE LAKE. "NATURE'S FIRST GREEN IS GOLD, HER HARDEST HUE TO HOLD." "HER EARLY LEAF'S A FLOWER, BUT ONLY FOR AN HOUR." Girl: CARLA! "THEN LEAF SUBSIDES TO LEAF." Girl: I'M AFRAID, CARLA! "SO HEAT SANK TO GRIEF." Girl: CARLA! "SO DAWN GOES DOWN TO DAY." Girl: CARLA! I'M AFRAID, CARLA! COME ON. JUST TIP IT AND LET HER GO FREE. JUST LET HER GO. "NOTHING GOLD CAN STAY." AAH! RACHEL. [MURMURING] RACHEL? SHE WANTED TO PULL ME IN. HEY, HEY. SHH! SHH! I COULDN'T BREATHE. SHH! SHH! SHH! SHE HAD HER HAND COME OUT-- Mark: IT'S OK. [CROWD MURMURS] I WANT TO GO HOME. CARLA, WHAT AB-- NO. I WANT TO GO HOME NOW! THE ROSES ARE BEAUTIFUL. THEY ALWAYS WERE HER FAVORITE FLOWER. MAYBE IT'S BETTER SHE STAYS WITH US A WHILE LONGER. YOU THINK? CAN I SEE? WE ALWAYS WERE TOGETHER. AND THE WAY SHE BELIEVED IN LIFE AFTER DEATH AND KARMA, IT'S PROBABLY BEST SHE'S HERE. AFTER ALL, MOM AND DAD DID LEAVE THE PLACE TO BOTH OF US. CARLA... LOOK AT ME. LOOK AT ME. WHAT HAPPENED AT THE LAKE WAS NOT RACHEL. SHE'S GONE. IF SHE'S GONE, IT'S BECAUSE I LET HER GO. DON'T DO THIS TO YOURSELF. I WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR HER. RACHEL DEPENDED ON ME FOR EVERYTHING. SHE WAS LOOKING INTO MY EYES, AND I COULDN'T HOLD ON. I CAN SEE HER FACE, THAT LOOK OF HORROR AND BETRAYAL. I CAN SEE IT NOW. I CAN SEE IT WHEN I SLEEP-- THAT'S NOT REAL. IT'S NOT RACHEL. YOU KNOW THAT. Girl: I'M AFRAID. CAN'T YOU COME UP AND GET IT, CARLA? YOU'RE SO MUCH BIGGER. JUST REACH, YOU SISSY. DO AS I TELL YOU. CAN'T YOU COME UP AND GET IT, CARLA? YOU'RE SO MUCH BIGGER. I'M AFRAID. COME DOWN. DOWN WHEREVER YOU ARE. DOWN, DOWN, WHEREVER YOU ARE. DOWN, DOWN, WHEREVER YOU ARE. COME UP, PLEASE. RACHEL! AAH! [DOOR OPENS] GOOD MORNING. HI. DIDN'T SLEEP WELL LAST NIGHT, DID YOU? UH, NO. I HAD A BAD DREAM. YEAH? WHAT ABOUT? WHEN RACHEL AND I WERE KIDS, THERE WAS A KITE STUCK IN A GUTTER. I CONNED HER INTO GOING UP TO GET IT, AND I NEARLY GOT HER KILLED. SHE FELL FROM THE ATTIC WINDOW. DID THAT REALLY HAPPEN? YEAH. IF IT HADN'T HAVE BEEN FOR THE HEDGE, SHE WOULD'VE DIED. I SPENT THE REST OF MY LIFE TRYING TO REGAIN HER TRUST. YOU NEVER TOLD ME THAT BEFORE. ARE THESE THE PICTURES FROM THE MOUNTAINS? NO, I THREW THOSE AWAY. WELL, YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT. I COULD'VE HANDLED IT. I KNOW. I JUST THINK IT'S BETTER WE MOVE ON. I'LL TAKE SOME NEW ONES. I DON'T NEED NEW ONES. I THINK YOU'LL FEEL BETTER WITH NEW ONES. I ALSO THINK MAYBE WE SHOULD FIND A DOCTOR FOR YOU TO SEE. I'LL BE FINE, ALL RIGHT? ALL I NEED IS A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP. OTHERWISE, I'M HUNKY-DORY. OK, THEN, HOW ABOUT NOT GOING TO WORK TODAY? GOING TO WORK IS THE BEST THING THAT I COULD DO. BESIDES, I'VE GOT AN EXCLUSIVE WITH SENATOR BILLINGS. HE'S RESIGNING, AND I'M NOT GOING TO LET HARRIS GET THE STORY. I'M OK. ALL RIGHT. I'LL BE AT THE STUDIO. OK. WAIT UP. HE'S IN 3415, RIGHT? YEAH. PENTHOUSE. OUR TAX DOLLARS AT WORK. [DING] Woman: I'LL MEET YOU IN THE CONFERENCE IN DETROIT. Man: DID YOU NOTICE IF THEY HAD A LAUNDRY SERVICE? Woman: SEE YOU LATER. Man: YEAH, THEY'VE GOT A LAUNDRY. THEY'LL DO IT FOR YOU, ACTUALLY. WHAT FLOOR ARE YOU ON? [MEN TALKING] HEY, UH, I HEARD THIS THING FELL YESTERDAY. HA HA HA. [WOMAN WHISPERING] Carla. [RACHEL'S FLUTE MUSIC PLAYING] [BREATHING HEAVILY] [BELL DINGS] Man: UH--UH--UH. SHE'S WAY OVERLOADED. [BUZZER] EXCUSE ME! I NEED TO GET OUT. HEY, HEY! THIS IS 25. WE NEED THE PENTHOUSE. I'LL MEET YOU UP THERE. I FORGOT SOMETHING. GEE, WHAT'D YOU DO, WALK? COME ON. THEY'RE GETTING ANTSY. WHERE IS HE? HE'S IN THE BEST LIGHT OVER HERE. YEAH. IF YOU'D JUST GET IT NOW. HERE SHE IS. SHE'S JUST COME IN. IF WE GET GOING NOW. NO, LISTEN, SENATOR-- UM, YOU KNOW BRADLEY. CARLA, WE'RE DYING HERE. WHY DON'T WE DO IT INSIDE? HE WANTS TO BE INTERVIEWED WITH THE CITY IN THE BACKGROUND. YOU WANT TO BE THE ONE TO TELL HIM TO COME INSIDE AND LOOK LIKE A COUCH SALESMAN? I CAN'T. CAN'T IS NOT IN OUR VOCABULARY, CARLA. YOU KNOW THAT. NOW, COME ON. Man: I UNDERSTAND THAT, OK? LET'S GO. HELLO, SENATOR. I THINK WE'RE JUST ABOUT SET. SOMETIME IN THIS CENTURY, I HOPE. UM, UH, WHY DON'T YOU STAND OVER HERE, SO WE CAN GET THAT NICE BACKDROP FOR YOU? PUT YOUR HAND ON THE RAIL. UH, SENATOR-- AAH! WHAT? Cameraman: COME ON, CARLA. LET'S GO. LET'S DO IT. [HORNS HONKING] JUST STAY CALM. WE'LL DO THE INTERVIEW. FORGET THE INTERVIEW. I'LL DO IT MYSELF. JUST TALK AMONG YOURSELVES FOR A SECOND. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. RIGHT BACK. I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME FOR THIS CRAP, YOU KNOW. WE GET HER OUT HERE AND SHE'S GONE! CARLA...ALL RIGHT, HE SAID FORGET THE INTERVIEW. HE'S GONNA MAKE A STATEMENT TO THE CAMERA. YOU KNOW, THAT TALKING HEAD THING? LISTEN, IT'S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT. I'LL JUST TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING. JUST SIT BACK AND RELAX. OK, CARLA. Senator: SEND A WOMAN TO DO A MAN'S JOB. WHAT DID I TELL YOU? HA HA HA. WHAT IS SHE HAVING, A HOT FLASH? Mark: SO I CONCENTRATED ON ACROPHOBIA. THAT'S WHAT YOU WANTED, RIGHT? RIGHT. FEAR OF HEIGHTS, FEAR OF FALLING. OK. WELL, HERE IN THE CITY, WE DO HAVE SEVERAL PSYCHIATRISTS WHO SPECIALIZE IN TREATMENT OF PHOBIAS. I'VE ALREADY CHECKED THEM ALL WITH THE A.M.A., AND THE CLOSEST WAS THIS GUY DR. OLIVER BARRETT OVER AT MOUNT SINAI HOSPITAL, BUT UNFORTUNATELY HE JUST DIED. IT'S LIKE SHE JUST WENT NEXT-DOOR FOR A MINUTE. IS THIS YOUR FIRST TIME IN HERE SINCE-- çi THIS IS THE SCARF SHE WAS WEARING ON THE CLIFF. IT CAN'T BE, CARLA. SHE PROBABLY HAD A COUPLE OF THOSE. NO. IT'S THE EXACT ONE. I BOUGHT IT FOR HER IN BERMUDA. WELL, YOU KNOW, ALL THOSE SOUVENIRS COME FROM THE SAME FACTORY IN CHINA. ARE YOU SURE YOU DESTROYED ALL THE PICTURES? YEAH. WHAT ABOUT THE NEGATIVES? YEAH. EVERYTHING. CARLA, IT'S NOT THE SAME SCARF. SO WHAT DO YOU GOT? WELL, THERE IS THIS NEW GUY, DR. PAUL SADOWSKI OVER AT THE UNIVERSITY. HE'S CURRENTLY CONDUCTING A STUDY ON ACROPHOBIA. HE'S WRITTEN A BOOK. PERFECT. WHAT'S HIS NUMBER? WELL, I'M NOT SURE HE DOES THERAPY. HOW WOULD I GET IN TOUCH WITH HIM? PSYCH DEPARTMENT AT THE UNIVERSITY. [HEART POUNDING, BREATHING HEAVILY] [HORN HONKS] [HONKING] HOW LONG DID YOU HAVE TO SIT BEFORE YOU COULD MOVE? 15 MINUTES... BUT I THINK I GOT DOWN, ONCE I GOT MOVING, IN ABOUT 2 SECONDS FLAT. DO I GET POINTS FOR THAT? NO ONE'S KEEPING SCORE HERE. I AM, AND I THINK I'M FAILING. ALL OF A SUDDEN, WHEN I'M IN A HIGH PLACE, I FEEL THE DROP PULLING ON ME, AND ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT IS FALLING. YOU WANT TO JUMP. YOU DON'T WASTE ANY TIME, DO YOU? LIFE IS SHORT, AND YOUR CASE IS NOT THAT UNIQUE, BELIEVE ME. I WOULD SUGGEST YOUR ACROPHOBIA IS TRIGGERED BY ASSOCIATIONS REMINDFUL OF YOUR SISTER'S DEATH. NOW, HEIGHT WILL ALWAYS BE THE STRONGEST ASSOCIATION, BUT ANY ASSOCIATION-- SIGHTS, SMELLS, SOUNDS-- HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO PUT YOU ON THE BRINK, WHICH IS THE CLASSIC PLACE FOR THE ACROPHOBIC-- TO FALL, TO JUMP, TO BE OR NOT TO BE. I GOT TO GET PAST THIS. I CAN'T LIVE LIKE THIS. IT'S AFFECTING MY MARRIAGE, MY WORK, MY SLEEP. I'LL PUT YOU IN TOUCH WITH A NUMBER OF GOOD THERAPISTS THAT WILL HELP YOU WITH RELAXATION, HYPNOSIS-- NO. I WANT TO WORK WITH YOU. NO, I'M A RESEARCHER, CARLA. YEAH, AND YOU'RE ALSO HEADING A STUDY RIGHT NOW WITH PATIENTS. THE INTERNET KNOWS ALL. WELL, UM, I'M WORKING WITH ONLY 4 PATIENTS. IT'S COMPLETELY EXPERIMENTAL. AND THEY'RE ALL EXTREME CASES. YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK? I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO BE FINE. I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE PEACE WITH THIS. I GOT TO GO. OK? THANKS FOR YOUR TIME. YOU'RE WELCOME. I CAN DO THIS.

THE MAN WHO SAVED HER SAID IF HE HADN'T GRABBED HER, SHE'D BE DEAD. WELL, IS SHE OK? WHERE IS SHE? SHE'S RIGHT OVER HERE. SHE SHOULD BE UP IN RECOVERY, BUT WE COULDN'T GET HER INTO THE ELEVATOR. WELL, SHE'S A LITTLE AFRAID OF ELEVATORS RIGHT NOW. YEAH, YOU'RE TELLING ME. LISTEN, SHE'S BEEN SEDATED, SO KEEP IT SIMPLE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. IT DOESN'T MATTER. OK? I TOLD THE DOCTORS I WASN'T GOING TO JUMP, BUT I WAS. OH, GOD, MARK, I'M SO FRIGHTENED. I DON'T WANT TO END UP IN A PSYCH WARD. CARLA, THAT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. THEY WANT ME TO SIGN VOLUNTARY COMMITMENT PAPERS. THEY WANT TO SEND ME TO GREENDALE. SHH! SHH! SHH! I WILL NOT LET THEM DO THAT, OK? I WILL STAY WITH YOU EVERY SINGLE MINUTE, IF I HAVE TO. OK? I THINK, UM, MAYBE WE SHOULD GO SEE DR. SADOWSKI AGAIN. OH, MARK, HE DOESN'T WANT TO TAKE ANY PATIENTS. IF HE DOESN'T TAKE YOU THIS TIME, I'LL PUNCH HIM IN THE NOSE. HE'S VERY TALL. I'LL PUNCH HIM IN THE NECK. OK? MM-HMM. LET'S GET YOU OUT OF HERE, ALL RIGHT? OK. I TRIED TO JUMP OFF THE FIFTH STORY OF A PARKING GARAGE. WHAT MORE DOES IT TAKE? YOU'RE ASKING TO BE PART OF SOMETHING YOU DON'T COMPREHEND. YOU THINK THIS IS ARMY BOOT CAMP. WHAT I DO IS NAVY SEAL STUFF, GET IT? I'M WORKING ON A TECHNIQUE CALLED "FLOODING." IT PUTS THE SUBJECTS IN UNRELIEVED CONFRONTATION WITH THEIR PHOBIAS. NOW, THE THEORY IS THAT THIS WILL ALLOW A BREAKTHROUGH, BUT THERE'S NO GUARANTEE OF THAT. JUST AS LIKELY, THEY'LL CRASH AND BURN. IT'S FOR CASES THAT HAVE NO OTHER HOPE OF RECOVERY. WELL, OK, THEN LET'S-- NO, BUT DO YOU THINK IT'LL WORK? WELL, IT ALREADY HAS WORKED IN PRELIMINARY TESTS. BUT I'M TRYING TO ANSWER A BIGGER QUESTION HERE. IF ACROPHOBICS IMPROVE WHEN THEY CONQUER THEIR GENERIC FEARS-- AIRPLANES, ELEVATORS, ROOFTOPS-- WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY BREAK THROUGH TO THE UNDERLYING CORE TERROR? WHAT WAS HIDDEN IN YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR SISTER? OR MORE SERIOUSLY, YOU WILLING TO RISK THE POSSIBILITY... IS THERE ANY HISTORY OF MENTAL ILLNESS IN YOUR FAMILY? UM... MY MOTHER SUFFERED FROM SCHIZOPHRENIA. THAT'S NOT ALWAYS HEREDITARY, THOUGH, IS IT? WELL, WE DON'T KNOW. BUT VERY OFTEN IT IS. LOOK, THIS RATCHETS THE STAKES WAY UP FOR YOU AND CARLA. IF CARLA WERE TO ENTER MY TREATMENT, SHE MIGHT BREAK THROUGH HER ACROPHOBIA INTO CLARITY ABOUT HER SISTER, OR SHE MIGHT BREAK THROUGH TO SOMETHING FAR MORE DEVASTATING. OK, SO IT'S... ME AGAINST THE BOGEYMAN. I'VE BEEN AFRAID OF THAT MY WHOLE LIFE. I WANT TO DO IT. Mark: ARE YOU SURE? Carla: I THINK IT'S WORTH IT. HOW DOES IT WORK? WE WORK AS A GROUP. SO I'M FLYING FOR THE AIRLINES AND--AND 15 YEARS WITHOUT AN INCIDENT, BUT... ONE DAY WE'RE ON-- WE'RE ON APPROACH TO PITTSBURGH, DESCENDING TO 27,000 FEET, WHEN, LIKE, THIS...THIS DOOR OPENS UP IN MY MIND THAT I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WAS THERE AND OUT--OUT STEPS THIS--THIS URGE TO J-JUMP OUT OF THE PLANE. I WAS PARALYZED-- THE COPILOT HAD TO LAND THE PLANE. OLD BENNY HERE, HE COULDN'T MOVE. DO YOU MIND IF I TELL MY OWN STORY, ZAK? DO YA, HUH? THE DOC--THE DOC'S HELPED ME TRACE IT BACK TO WHEN I WAS IN THE ARMY. I WAS A FIRST INFANTRY PARATROOPER--THE SCREAMING EAGLES, YOU KNOW? UP IN THE PLANE WITH MY JUMP BUDDY, IVAN IRELAND-- DO YOU BELIEVE THAT NAME? WHO NAMES THEIR KID IVAN IRE-- IT WAS A FREEFALL EXERCISE. IVAN JUMPED FIRST, BUT HIS CHUTE DIDN'T OPEN, AND I DOVE OUT, AND I TRIED TO CATCH UP TO HIM, BUT I WAS TOO LATE. IF I HADN'T PULLED MY OWN RIP CORD, I WOULD'VE GONE IN WITH HIM. I WATCHED HIM FALL. I SAW HIM HIT THE GROUND. YEAH, BUT YOU DID THE BEST YOU COULD. I SHOULD HAVE GONE IN WITH HIM. THE FACT IS, HE... HE WASN'T FEELING RIGHT THAT DAY. HE DIDN'T EVEN TRUST HIMSELF TO PACK HIS OWN CHUTE. I DID IT. OOPS. LISTEN, YOU STUPID LITTLE PUNK! OKAY! WE HAVIN' FUN YET? COME ON, BENNY. READY TO HIT THE TRAIL? LET'S GO. OH, OH, ZAK! GET A LIFE! Sadowski: YOU OK, BENNY? YOU ALL RIGHT? I'M OK, YEAH. YEAH. WHOO! WHOA! COME ON, BEN! WHOO-HOO! BENNY, COME ON OUT HERE! HE'S GONNA FALL. OH, YEAH. WE SHOULD BE SO LUCKY. NO, UNFORTUNATELY, HE'S JUST SHOWING OFF. Hallie: HE USED TO BE LIKE THE REST OF US, THEN HE GOT CURED TOO WELL. NOW HE'S COUNTER-PHOBIC. OBSESSED WITH PROVING HE'S NOT AFRAID OF HEIGHTS. Sadowski: HEY, ZAK! KNOCK IT OFF, WILL YOU? SHOW SOME RESPECT FOR OTHERS. COME ON, BEN! HE EVEN GOT A JOB WASHING WINDOWS ON CLARKE TOWER, JUST SO HE CAN LOOK DOWN. OH, BEN, MAN, IT'S GREAT! I'M HOPING HE DIES FROM THE CURE. BOO! OK, BEN, YOU'RE NEXT. NO WISECRACKS. WE SUPPORT EACH OTHER. Zak: PIECE O'CAKE, BUDDY. COME ON. COME ON, MAN, YOU CAN DO IT. I'M SUPPORTING. THAT'S SUPPORT, ISN'T IT? Sadowski: OK, BEN. COME ON. FOLLOW MY VOICE. COME ON. ONE STEP... THEN ANOTHER. FOLLOW MY VOICE. KEEPING MOVING. DON'T STOP. KEEP MOVING. THAT'S IT. YOU'RE DOING GREAT. YOU'RE DOING GREAT. THAT'S RIGHT. COME ON, BEN. WHY THE BLINDFOLD? SO HE CAN CONCENTRATE ON DOC'S VOICE. Sadowski: YOU'RE DOING GREAT. YOU'RE DOING GREAT! I DON'T THINK I CAN DO THAT. Sadowski: FOLLOW IT. YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO TOO FAR ON YOUR FIRST TIME OUT. BUT HE'LL PUSH YOU. IF YOU DON'T DO WHAT HE SAYS, HE'LL COUNT TO 3... AND THEN IT'S OVER. YOU'RE OUT OF THE GROUP. FOLLOW MY VOICE. COME ON, BEN! [WHINES] STAND UP! NO, NO, NO! STAND UP! STAND UP! THAT'S IT. COME ON, KEEP COMING. KEEP COMING. FARTHER THAN LAST TIME. FARTHER THAN LAST TIME. THAT'S IT. STOP! [WHINES] LOOK AROUND. NOT BAD. MUCH BETTER THAN LAST TIME. THAT'S A LOT FARTHER THAN THE LAST TIME. Hallie: YOU'RE DOIN' IT, BEN! WE LOVE YOU, BEN. NOT! CARLA, HAVE YOU SEEN THE DROP? IT'S 300 FEET, STRAIGHT DOWN. PLEASE DON'T. [IMITATES FALLING OBJECT] KNOCK IT OFF, ZAK! JAGGED ROCKS, WATER BOILING UP-- STOP IT! CLOSE YOUR EYES. UM... I'M SORRY. Sadowski: DON'T SAY "I'M SORRY." SAY "I'M SCARED." I'M SCARED. WELL, THAT'S NOTHING TO APOLOGIZE FOR. NOTHING TO BE ASHAMED OF. I CAN'T. [CLUCKS] UNH. [COUGHS] BUT YOU HAVE TO DO IT. YOU'RE COMMITTED TO DO IT. WELL, I CAN'T. ONE... COME ON, CARLA. JUST CLOSE YOUR EYES, CARLA. 2... MMM. OK. OK. COME ON. STEP. UHH... THAT'S ALL I WANT YOU TO DO TODAY. JUST TRUST ME. MMM... YOU KNOW WHY I LET ZAK SHOW OFF THE WAY HE DOES? NO, I GUESS NOT. BECAUSE HIS COURAGE IS CONTAGIOUS. SO IS YOUR FEAR. FEAR CAN'T HURT YOU UNLESS YOU SURRENDER TO IT, BUT ONCE YOU DO, IT CAN KILL YOU. JOCELYN, YOU'RE NEXT. [MARK LAUGHS] OK, GIVE ME SOME... RIGHT HERE. WELL, YOU LOOK BETTER THAN I'VE SEEN YOU LOOK IN WEEKS. IT'S THE BEST I'VE FELT. I'M WITH PEOPLE WHO UNDERSTAND ME. IT'S AMAZING HOW FAST PEOPLE CAN BOND WHEN THEY HAVE A COMMON ENEMY. I'M THINKING I MIGHT BE ABLE TO GO BACK TO WORK. YEAH. I THINK YOU'RE PROBABLY THE HEALTHIEST ONE OF THE BUNCH, AREN'T YOU? HAS HE ACTUALLY EVER CURED ANYONE, THIS DOCTOR? YES! ACTUALLY, THIS KID ZAK. HE'S, UH, WELL, ACTUALLY, NOW, HE'S A COUNTER-PHOBIC. COUNTER-PHOBIC? YEAH, DON'T YOU-- HE'S, UH... AFRAID OF COUNTERS. YEAH, RIGHT. HE FREAKS OUT IN DINERS. EXACTLY. NO, HE HAS TO PROVE HE'S NOT A PHOBIC. HE WASHES WINDOWS AT CLARKE TOWER JUST TO KNOW HE'S OK. OH, YEAH, HE'S HEALTHY. THE DOCTOR'S WORKING ON A SPECIAL PROGRAM FOR HIM, BRING HIM BACK TO NORMAL. WHATEVER THAT IS. HEY, MR. PETERSON. IT'S ZAK. Peterson: YEAH. UH, BOB NEVER SHOWED TODAY. YEAH, AND THERE'S NO ANSWER AT HIS HOUSE EITHER. YEAH, I GUESS I CAN DO THE WORK. IS HE GOING TO SHOW UP, THOUGH? YEAH, HEY, NO PROBLEM. I MEAN, I DO MOST OF THE WORK ANYWAY, RIGHT? SO DOES THIS MEAN YOU'RE, UH, GOING TO PAY ME DOUBLE TODAY? [CLICK AND DIAL TONE] WHAT? HELLO? [BEEP] THERE'S NO NEED TO BE RUDE. FEEL THE RUSH! WHOO! [FOOTSTEPS] BOB? [GRAVEL CRUNCHES] [SCREAMING] Female Reporter: THE 19-YEAR-OLD UNIVERSITY STUDENT, ZACHARY CARTER, FELL TO HIS DEATH JUST BEFORE DAWN TODAY FROM THE WINDOW CLEANING SCAFFOLD HE WAS WORKING ON. THE SCAFFOLD ITSELF WAS INSPECTED AND FOUND TO BE IN WORKING ORDER. POLICE SAY THE YOUTH WAS WORKING ALONE, HOWEVER, WHICH IS AGAINST OSHA SAFETY RULES. [EXCITED CONVERSATION] HI, GUYS. HI. HI. WHERE'S SADOWSKI? HE'S IN HIS OFFICE WITH THE POLICE. WHAT ARE THE POLICE DOING HERE? THEY THINK HE'S INVOLVED SOMEHOW. ZAK WAS BLINDFOLDED. DID YOU KNOW THAT? NO. WE'RE THE ONLY ONES WHO KNOW THAT DOC USES A BLINDFOLD. WE KNOW IT WAS NONE OF US, BECAUSE NONE OF US COULD GET UP ON THAT ROOF ALONE. UNLESS SOMEBODY'S FAKING IT. OHH! LISTEN. DO ME A FAVOR... [TALKING QUIETLY] EXCUSE ME. DETECTIVE YERXA, RIGHT? YEAH. CARLA ENGEL, KCEI-TV. OH, RIGHT. YEAH, YOU COVERED THE CARLSON CASE. VERY GOOD. DOING A STORY ON THIS? UH, NOT EXACTLY. DO YOU THINK THE DOCTOR HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT? SADOWSKI SAYS HE WAS AT A CONFERENCE IN ALBUQUERQUE LAST NIGHT. I'D BE ASTONISHED IF HE'D LIE ABOUT SOMETHING WE COULD EASILY CHECK WITH A PHONE CALL... WHICH PHONE CALL I'M ABOUT TO MAKE, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME. IS IT TRUE THAT ZAK WAS BLINDFOLDED? YEAH. MAYBE THE KID WAS PRACTICING THE STUFF THE DOC TAUGHT HIM. PRETTY CRAZY, THIS DOC, IF YOU ASK ME. TAKE CARE. HEY. HEY. I'M SORRY ABOUT ZAK. WELL, HE KNEW THE RISK. WE ALL DID. RIGHT? RIGHT. LET'S GO. Woman: YEAH, I'LL-- I'LL TAKE CARE OF THAT. WHEN ONE FALLS IN LIFE... THERE ARE 2 POSSIBILITIES: EITHER ONE CANNOT GET UP, OR ONE GETS UP AS BEST ONE CAN AND MOVES FORWARD. THOSE WHO CANNOT GET UP... ARE KNOWN AS BABIES, THE ELDERLY, COWARDS, OR THE DEAD! THE PEOPLE WHO GET UP ARE KNOWN AS WARRIORS. ANYBODY HERE WHO CONSIDERS HIMSELF OR HERSELF AMONG THE FORMER, PLEASE RAISE YOUR HAND. AND WHO HERE CONSIDERS HIMSELF OR HERSELF A WARRIOR? LET'S SEE IF THAT'S SO. Sadowski: COME ON, COME ON. COME ON. ONE STEP AT A TIME. COME ON. DON'T THINK ABOUT WHERE YOU ARE. THINK ABOUT MY VOICE. COME ON. Sadowski: REMEMBER... ANY FEAR CAN BE OVERCOME BY A GREATER FEAR. IF FLAMES WERE LICKING AT YOUR BACK, YOU'D MOVE. IF YOUR CHILD WAS ABOUT TO FALL OFF THAT EDGE, YOU'D BE THERE IN A HEARTBEAT. ONE... COME ON, HALLIE. 2... YOU CAN DO IT, HALLIE. YOU DID IT BEFORE. UH...THAT WAS ANOTHER ROOF. MUCH LOWER. THERE WAS A RAIL. LAST TIME WE HAD ZAK! DON'T THINK ABOUT ZAK! I CAN'T HELP IT. OHH! 3. [HALLIE SOBS] I'M SORRY, HALLIE. LAST TIME YOU MADE IT OUT TO THE PIPE. NO, I CAN'T. ARE YOU GOING TO LET WHAT HAPPENED TO ZAK RUIN EVERYTHING THAT WE WORKED FOR? HMM? YOU KNOW WHAT ZAK WOULD BE DOING IF HE WERE HERE? HE'D BE DANCING ON THE EDGE OF THIS ROOF, LAUGHING AT YOU! HE'D BE ASHAMED OF YOU! YOU MAKE A MOCKERY OF HIS DEATH! OR IS IT SOMETHING ELSE? YOU THINK MAYBE I HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH WHAT HAPPENED TO ZAK? DO YOU?! I DON'T THINK YOU DID IT. YEAH, BUT YOU'RE NOT SURE, ARE YOU? AND THAT TINY LITTLE SHADOW OF A DOUBT, NO MATTER HOW SMALL, WILL BE THE RUINATION OF EVERYTHING THAT WE'VE WORKED FOR. BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T TRUST ME COMPLETELY, IT'S OVER. RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW! Sadowski: FEAR CAN'T HURT YOU UNLESS YOU SURRENDER TO IT. ONCE YOU DO... IT CAN KILL YOU. COME ON, DOC. YOU CAN MAKE IT. Hallie: I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DID THAT. IT WASN'T ME. IT WAS LIKE I WAS STANDING OUTSIDE MYSELF, WATCHING. OH, I SAW YOU MOVING FORWARD, GETTING CLOSER TO THE EDGE. I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO JUMP. OH, SO DID I! OH, I WISH I COULD HAVE SEEN US. WHEN SADOWSKI SAID THAT WOULD BE THE END OF THE GROUP, I JUST... I SNAPPED, YOU KNOW? I HAD TO DO SOMETHING. I SAW MY WHOLE LIFE FLASH BEFORE MY EYES. I JUST KEPT THINKING ABOUT MY KIDS. THAT'S WHAT GOT ME OUT ON THE ROOF. HOW MANY KIDS YOU GOT? UMM, 3. PICTURES, PICTURES. YES, YES. HERE. THEY DON'T TALK TO ME ANYMORE, THOUGH. WHY NOT? OH, WELL, THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS GOT SO BAD I WOULDN'T EVEN COME UP OUT OF THE BASEMENT. THAT'S WHEN THEY SENT ME TO GREENDALE. 2 YEARS, STRAIGHTJACKET, HELMET, WHOLE 9 YARDS. BUT...THEY KEEP ME GOING. IF I DIDN'T EVER THINK I'D SEE THEM AGAIN, SOMETIME, SOMEHOW, I'D END IT ALL TOMORROW. DO YOU HAVE ANY KIDS? AH, NO...NOT YET. BUT WHEN I DO... I HOPE THEY LOOK LIKE HIM. OH, MY GOODNESS. MMM...OOH, WHAT A HUNK! WHERE WAS THAT TAKEN? Carla: UH, BERMUDA. WE MET LAST AUGUST. MY SISTER AND I WENT THERE AFTER MY PARENTS DIED, AND MARK WAS DOING A PHOTO SHOOT, AND, ACTUALLY, RACHEL MET HIM FIRST. SHE INTRODUCED US. WELL, YOU LOOK GREAT TOGETHER. ♪ ...WHO WILL TAKE OUR LAST CHANCES ♪ ♪ WHO WILL UNMAKE THINGS GONE WRONG ♪ Rachel: CRANK IT UP, CRANK IT UP! I LOVE THIS SONG. ♪ WHO WILL TAKE OUR LAST CHANCES... ♪ YOU CAN'T LET GO OF ME! AAH! AAH! HEY, IT'S ONLY ME. WH-WHAT'S THE MATTER? I'M SO SCARED. I THINK RACHEL'S STALKING ME. WHAT? THE SCARF. WHAT SCARF? THAT SHE WAS WEARING ON THE CLIFF. I PUT IT RIGHT HERE THE OTHER DAY. WHERE IS IT NOW? I...MAYBE THE HOUSEKEEPER PUT IT AWAY. NO, THE HOUSEKEEPER DOESN'T COME TILL TOMORROW, MARK. RACHEL HAS IT. RACHEL HAS IT. I SAW HER. SHE WAS WEARING IT. I SAW IT ON HER TONIGHT! OH... I'M CRAZY. I'M CRAZY! YOU'RE NOT CRAZY, OK? YOU'RE JUST EXHAUSTED. COME ON. I GOT AN IDEA. I WANT YOU TO SAY WHAT I SAY. RACHEL, I LOVED YOU WITH ALL MY HEART. RACHEL, I LOVED YOU WITH ALL MY HEART. AND I DID EVERYTHING THAT I COULD TO SAVE YOU. AND I DID EVERYTHING I COULD TO SAVE YOU. BUT NOW I HAVE TO GO ON WITH MY LIFE AND PUT THIS TERRIBLE PAIN BEHIND ME. MAYBE THAT DOCTOR IS... PUSHING YOU TOO FAST. [SIGHS] THIS GROUP IS MY ONLY HOPE OF GETTING BETTER. YES, BUT-- I'M NOT GOING TO LEAVE IT, MARK. CARLA... [DOORBELL RINGS] MARK, JUST LEAVE IT. JUST LEAVE IT. [DOORBELL RINGS] I SHOULD GET IT. [KNOCK ON DOOR] [DOORBELL RINGS] SORRY TO DISTURB YOU, SIR. DETECTIVE YERXA. IS YOUR WIFE IN? GOOD EVENING, MA'AM. I'M AFRAID I'M GOING TO HAVE TO ASK YOU TO COME DOWN TO THE STATION. WHAT IS IT? WHAT'S WRONG? WE HAVE WHAT LOOKS LIKE A SUICIDE, AND YOUR NAME APPEARS AT THE SCENE. WHAT?! WRITTEN BY THE VICTIM... IN HER OWN BLOOD BEFORE SHE DIED. WHO? Yerxa: A WOMAN BY THE NAME OF HALLIE BARNES. HALLIE'S DEAD? YES, MA'AM. IT APPEARS SHE JUMPED FROM THE ROOF OF HER APARTMENT BUILDING... 3 STORIES. AMAZING SHE COULD WRITE ANYTHING AT ALL. SHE EVER MENTION THINKING ABOUT SUICIDE? SHE DID SAY SHE MIGHT TRY IT IF SHE COULDN'T GET HER KIDS BACK, BUT I'M SURE SHE WASN'T ACTUALLY THINKING ABOUT IT. YOU'D BE SURPRISED AT WHAT PEOPLE THINK ABOUT. THEN AGAIN, IF THERE WAS FOUL PLAY, THE LAST THING SHE DID WAS WRITE YOUR NAME, WHICH MIGHT BE SIGNIFICANT. I WAS HER FRIEND, FOR GOD'S SAKES. WAIT A SECOND. IF ANYBODY COULD'VE GOTTEN HER OUT ON THAT ROOF, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DR. SADOWSKI. WE'RE LOOKING INTO THAT. SHE WAS BLINDFOLDED, YOU KNOW. SHE WAS? MM-HMM. SAME AS THAT KID ON CLARKE TOWER. YOU KNEW HIM, TOO, RIGHT? SEE, THIS IS THE ONE WE TOOK OFF HIM COUPLE DAYS AGO. AND HERE'S THE ONE FROM HALLIE BARNES LAST NIGHT. LOOKS PRETTY SIMILAR, DON'T IT? FACT IS, LAB SAYS THEY'RE THE VERY SAME KIND OF CLOTH. THAT ISN'T EVEN THE MOST INTERESTING THING. SEE? THIS IS MINE. AAH! MY, MY, MY. GET HER SOME WATER. SHE HAVE A HISTORY OF THAT? YOU GOT A HISTORY OF BEING AN IDIOT? ARE YOU ACCUSING HER? HUH? 'CAUSE IF YOU ARE, JUST COME OUT AND SAY SO, OK? I'M JUST POINTING OUT SOMETHING INTERESTING HERE. SHE'S A MEMBER OF THE PRESS, NO? I MADE NO ACCUSATIONS THAT I RECALL. IS SHE UNDER ARREST? CERTAINLY NOT. FACT IS, THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THAT ANYBODY WAS ON THAT ROOF WITH HER. NO SIGN OF STRUGGLE. NO MARKS ON THE LADY'S BODY, EXCEPT FOR IMPACT WITH CONCRETE, I'LL PROBABLY WRITE IT UP AS A SUICIDE. IT'S JUST THAT HER NAME WAS RIGHT THERE ON THE SIDEWALK. RACHEL IS DEAD. YOU'VE GOT TO START ACCEPTING THAT OR-- OR WHAT? I'LL GO CRAZY LIKE MY MOTHER? NO. THAT IS NOT WHAT I MEANT. CAN'T YOU SEE THAT RACHEL IS OUT THERE? SHE'S ALWAYS DISTRUSTED ME. EVER SINCE WE WERE KIDS. AND NOW THAT I LET HER FALL, SHE'LL NEVER FORGIVE ME. CARLA, COME ON. YOU GOTTA FIGHT THIS. I HAVE LIFE, AND RACHEL DOESN'T... AND IT'S MY FAULT. SHE'LL NEVER LET ME REST. SHE'LL KILL EVERYONE I LOVE AND THEN TEAR ME DOWN WITH HER. I WANT YOU TO QUIT THE GROUP. NO, I WILL NOT QUIT THE GROUP! NO. LISTEN, HOW WELL DO YOU REALLY KNOW THESE PEOPLE? BY NOW YOU ALL HAVE EACH OTHER'S PHONE NUMBERS AND ADDRESSES. YEAH. THE HOUSE WAS OPEN ALL DAY WHEN I WAS AT MY STUDIO. SOMEBODY WHO KNEW YOU, WHO KNEW YOUR STORY, KNEW YOUR VULNERABILITY, COULD EASILY HAVE GOTTEN IN HERE TO TAKE THAT SCARF. [TELEPHONE RINGS] [RING] HELLO. IT'S BEN FROM THE GROUP. HI, BEN.,@ YEAH. HE QUESTIONED US THIS MORNING. HE THINKS IT'S A SUICIDE-- WHAT--WHAT DO YOU-- BEN, NO! BEN, WAIT! [HANGS UP] HE'S QUITTING. YEAH. SEE? I THINK THAT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO. MAYBE THAT'S WHAT RACHEL WANTS. YOU KNOW, TO ISOLATE ME. THAT IS CRAZY. WRONG WORD, MARK. WHERE YOU GOING? I HAVE TO TALK TO HIM. CARLA... [KNOCK ON DOOR] EXCUSE THE MESS. WANT ANY WATER OR ANYTHING? NO. I CAN'T STAY LONG, BEN. LOOK, I JUST-- I WANTED TO SEE YOU FACE-TO-FACE AND TELL YOU YOU CAN'T QUIT THE GROUP NOW. NO? WATCH THIS. BEN, PLEASE DON'T LET HALLIE'S SUICIDE RUIN ALL WE'VE WORKED FOR. HALLIE WASN'T A SUICIDE. HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT? CAN'T TELL YOU. DID YOU TELL DETECTIVE YERXA? I CAN'T. WHY? MAYBE BECAUSE I'M CRAZY. I DON'T KNOW ANYMORE. I MEAN, LOOK AT ME. I'M PACKING MY THINGS. I'M LEAVING. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE I'M GOING. MAYBE KANSAS. I UNDERSTAND IT'S REALLY FLAT THERE. BEN, I'M NOT THE POLICE, ALL RIGHT? I'M JUST YOUR FRIEND. YOU CAN TELL ME. IT'S NOT THAT I WANT TO QUIT. I DON'T HAVE ANY CHOICE. WHAT HAPPENED? I GOT A PHONE CALL. FROM WHO? I CAN'T TELL YOU. BEN, JUST TELL ME. DO YOU REMEMBER THE GUY I TOLD YOU ABOUT FROM THE ARMY? YOUR FRIEND? THE ONE WHOSE CHUTE DIDN'T OPEN? IT WAS HIM. YEAH. IVAN IRELAND HIMSELF. I THOUGHT YOU SAID HE DIED. HE DID. THEN HOW COULD HE CALL YOU? THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION, AND YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M NOT HANGING AROUND TO FIND OUT THE ANSWER. BEN, YOUR FRIEND IS DEAD, ALL RIGHT? DEAD PEOPLE DON'T MAKE PHONE CALLS. I KNOW THAT! MAYBE EVEN YOU KNOW THAT, BUT APPARENTLY HE DOESN'T KNOW THAT 'CAUSE IT WAS HIM. HE KNEW EVERYTHING ABOUT THE PLANE. HE KNEW ALL THE DETAILS, AND HE KNEW WHAT I WAS DOING HERE, TOO. HE EVEN TOLD ME ABOUT HALLIE BEFORE THE POLICE EVER CAME. tw WHAT... WHAT ABOUT HALLIE? HE TOLD ME SHE WAS DEAD. HE KNOWS WHO KILLED HER, TOO. SOMEONE FROM HIS SIDE, HE SAID. SAID HE DOESN'T KNOW HER NAME OR WHAT SHE LOOKS LIKE BECAUSE SHE KEEPS HER FACE ALL COVERED. BUT SHE'S A FELLOW FALLER. HE WANTS TO MAKE ME SUFFER FOR WHAT I DID. JUST LIKE THE GIRL IN THE SCARF WANTS THE ONE THAT'S RESPONSIBLE FOR HER FALLING TO SUFFER. GIRL IN THE SCARF? YEAH. HE SAID HE KEEPS HER FACE COVERED BECAUSE IT'S ALL BROKEN AWAY FROM THE ROCKS. Rachel: YOU CAN'T LET GO OF ME! BEN... I CANNOT EXPLAIN WHAT'S HAPPENING. I JUST KNOW... WE NEED THE GROUP. YOU CAN'T QUIT. WE NEED EACH OTHER. YOU, ME, AND JOCELYN. I JUST SPOKE TO JOCELYN. SHE'S QUIT, TOO. Young Rachel: ♪ CARLA, JOIN ME ♪ ♪ CARLA ♪ SO, HOW DID YOU FIND ME? I WENT TO YOUR HOUSE. SOMEONE HELD UP A NOTE. THAT WAS MY MOM. SHE HASN'T TALKED IN 5 YEARS. SHE'S PHOBIC ABOUT EVERYTHING, INCLUDING PEOPLE. LOOK, JOCELYN, WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT-- LOOK, I DON'T BELIEVE IN GHOSTS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO ZAK, BUT HALLIE KILLED HERSELF. AND I KNOW WHY. SAME REASON I TRIED LAST YEAR. I JUMPED OUT OF A THIRD STORY WINDOW. SPENT 8 MONTHS IN THE HOSPITAL. RIGHT NOW I FEEL LIKE I COULD DO IT AGAIN. LOOK, JOCELYN, I DON'T SEE HOW HALLIE COULD'VE DONE THAT. WELL, WHEN YOU'RE DESPERATE, YOU DO IT. IT GOT SO BAD THAT I'D GO TO BED AND PRAY, "PLEASE, GOD, DON'T LET ME WAKE UP IN THE MORNING." I MEAN, WHAT WAS I LIVING FOR? TO KEEP MY MOTHER OUT OF AN INSTITUTION? TO KEEP MYSELF OUT? YOU'RE GETTING BETTER, RIGHT? AND HALLIE WAS GETTING BETTER, TOO. WELL, IF YOU STOP NOW, YOU'RE JUST GONNA BE RIGHT BACK WHERE YOU STARTED. I DON'T KNOW! WHAT I DO KNOW IS THAT I DON'T WANT TO END UP LIKE MY MOTHER. AND I DON'T WANT TO DIE. YOU DON'T HAVE TO. WE CAN BEAT THIS THING. I'M SCARED, CARLA. I'M SCARED, TOO, JOCELYN! THIS IS NO WAY TO LIVE. WE CANNOT QUIT NOW. JOCELYN, WE COULD DO THIS. DEAL? DEAL. I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING, BUT I'VE MADE UP MY MIND. WHY? BECAUSE THERE'S ONLY 2 OF US? NO, IT'S NOT THAT. BUT I CAN'T PUT YOU OR MY REPUTATION AT RISK WHILE SOMEBODY'S TRYING TO SABOTAGE MY WORK. WHO WOULD HATE YOU THAT MUCH? I DON'T KNOW. COULD BE A COLLEAGUE WHO WANTS TO SEE ME FAIL. COULD BE A FORMER PATIENT. BUT YOU'RE PUTTING US AT RISK BY QUITTING. I WOULD BE DEAD NOW IF IT WASN'T FOR YOU. SO WOULD I. YOU KNOW WHAT? HALLIE IS DEAD BECAUSE OF ME. WHAT HAPPENED TO ZAK, ALSO BECAUSE OF ME. WHAT ABOUT THE PHONE CALL TO BEN? WELL, I DON'T THINK ANYBODY CALLED BEN. I THINK THAT WAS JUST AN EXCUSE TO QUIT THE GROUP OR TO GET OUT OF TOWN BEFORE THE POLICE START ASKING TOO MANY QUESTIONS. I SAW BEN. HE WAS TERRIFIED. MM-HMM. WELL, BEN'S GOOD AT BEING AFRAID. HE ALSO HATED ZAK. NOTHING'S IMPOSSIBLE TO ME ANYMORE. YOU TOLD US IF WE FACED OUR WORST TERROR, WE WOULD BE CURED. IT WAS JUST A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE SOMEBODY ELSE GETS HURT. THEN LET'S NOT WASTE ANY TIME. LET'S GO FOR BROKE. NO HALF-MEASURES. YOU'RE HARDLY READY FOR THAT. I'M TELLING YOU, WE ARE. I'LL GO FIRST. IT'D BE YOUR WORST NIGHTMARE. FEAR CAN'T HURT ME, RIGHT? Dr. Sadowski: YOU READY IN THE BOAT? WE'RE ALL SET. WE'RE READY AND WAITING. STEP OUT ON THAT PLATFORM. [PANTING] TAKE A STEP. DO IT. ALL RIGHT, KEEP GOING. KEEP GOING. TAKE A STEP. AND ANOTHER. JOCELYN, MAKE ME PROUD. YOU CAN DO IT. COME ON, COME ON, COME ON. YOU CAN DO IT. KEEP GOING. KEEP GOING. A LITTLE FARTHER. YOU'RE THERE. JUST PUSH ME! NO! YOU SAID YOU WANTED TO DO IT, JOCELYN. DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO. LET'S GO, LET'S GO. IT'S WORKING. IT'S WORKING. [STATIC] Rachel: CARLA! [LAUGHING] CARLA! I'M NOT AFRAID ANYMORE. Rachel: CARLA! JOCELYN! JOCELYN, DON'T DO IT! HA HA HA HA! I'M NOT AFRAID ANYMORE! JOCELYN, CAN YOU HEAR ME? DO IT. DON'T JUMP! AH! I FEEL LIKE I CAN DO ANYTHING! DO IT, DO IT, DO IT. DON'T DO IT! DON'T JUMP! AH! AAH! WHOO-HOO! YEAH! WHOO! Jocelyn: OH, I DID IT! HA HA HA HA! OH, YES! YES! YOU DID IT, JOCELYN! OH, LOOK AT ME, GIRL! WHOO! AH HA HA HA! IS THERE ANYWHERE ELSE I CAN FIND INFORMATION ON THIS GUY? WELL, I SUPPOSE IF YOU HAD A TISSUE SAMPLE, YOU COULD DO A DNA TEST. OTHERWISE, AT THIS POINT, I WOULD WAGER THAT YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT HIM THAN HIS MOTHER DOES. WHAT EXACTLY ARE YOU LOOKING FOR? I DON'T KNOW. SOMETHING. Carla: HOW DO YOU FEEL? Jocelyn: OHH! IT WAS INCREDIBLE. IT WAS SO AWESOME. JUST WAIT AND SEE. HA HA HA! OK. I'LL GET THE CREDIT CARD, YOU CHOOSE THE RESTAURANT. AND DON'T SCRIMP. I'M SORRY YOU HAVE TO WAIT OUT HERE. I UNDERSTAND. MAYBE I'LL GET HER TO COME TO THE WINDOW AND WAVE. OK. [RACHEL GIGGLING] [GIGGLING] AAH! SHE FELL. CARLA! CARLA! WHAT HAPPENED? MY MOTHER. SHE'S... WHAT? SHE FELL IN THE BATHROOM. SHE'S DEAD. OH, I SHOULDN'T HAVE LEFT HER ALONE! IT HAD TO HAVE BEEN AN ACCIDENT. SHE WAS SO HAPPY FOR ME. SHE KNEW WHAT I WAS GONNA DO TODAY. DO YOU KNOW WHAT I SAW WHEN I FIRST WALKED INTO THE HOUSE? IT WAS RIGHT ON THE TABLE ON THE DINING ROOM. Carla: THE ROSES ARE BEAUTIFUL. THEY ALWAYS WERE HER FAVORITE FLOWER. ALL SHE WROTE ON THE CARD WAS... "CONGRATULATIONS." [DOOR CLOSES] CARLA! CARLA! WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I KNOW YOU THINK I'M CRAZY. NO. I JUST ASKED YOU WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WE NEVER IDENTIFIED THE BODY PROPERLY. HER FACE WAS SO BADLY SMASHED, YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW IF IT WAS HER OR NOT. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF THIS IS HER OR NOT. WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA FIND IN THERE? I THOUGHT MAYBE I COULD FIND HER GOLD FILLINGS, BUT THEN I REALIZED THAT THOSE PEOPLE AT THE CREMATORIUM, THEY WOULD'VE STOLE THAT. BUT THEN I REALIZED THEY WOULD MISS THE PIN IN HER WRIST THAT THE DOCTOR PUT IN WHEN SHE BROKE IT. IT'S NOT HERE. SO? THE TITANIUM, IT WOULDN'T MELT. OH, BUT EVEN IF IT WOULD, THEY WOULDN'T WANT IT. JUST WHAT IF THIS ISN'T HER? ALL RIGHT, WOULD YOU LISTEN TO YOURSELF? I'M TRYING TO FIGURE THIS OUT, MARK. I'M SEEING HER! I'M HEARING HER! WHY? I MEAN, MAYBE... MAYBE IF THIS ISN'T HER, MAYBE SHE'S ALIVE. NO! SHE'S DEAD! THEY HAVE THOUGHT OF EVERYTHING. MAYBE IT'S SADOWSKI. MAYBE IT'S BEN. I'VE EVEN THOUGHT IT COULD BE YOU. ANYTHING IS EASIER THAN BELIEVING IT'S RACHEL. HOW ELSE AM I GONNA EXPLAIN ALL THIS? YOU WANT AN EXPLANATION? LOOK AT THIS. LOOK AT IT. YOUR DR. SADOWSKI IS NOT WHO HE SAYS HE IS. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? I FOUND OUT WHO HE WAS BEFORE HE BECAME A DOCTOR. SEE, LOOK, HE USED TO BE A MOUNTAINEERING GUY. AND ON HIS LAST TRIP, HE TOOK A BUNCH OF PEOPLE UP TO MOUNT RAINIER, AND NONE OF THEM CAME BACK. EXCEPT FOR SADOWSKI. AND THE REST OF THEM, THEY FELL TO THEIR DEATHS OFF A 3,500-FOOT CLIFF. THIS SOUNDS LIKE AN ACCIDENT-- MAYBE, OK? BUT THE BEAUTY OF BEING THE ONLY SURVIVOR IS THAT YOU GET TO SAY WHAT HAPPENED. I THINK THIS IS A SICK GUY WHO NEEDS TO TAKE PEOPLE UP TO HIGH PLACES AND WATCH THEM SUFFER AND POSSIBLY DIE. THAT'S WHY HE NEEDS DESPERATE PEOPLE. PEOPLE WHO WILL DO WHATEVER HE SAYS. BUT HE CURED ZAK AND JOCELYN. THEN LOOK WHAT HE DID. OK, MAYBE HE THINKS THAT HE CURED ZAK. MArYBE HE THINKS HE'S HELPING JOCELYN. BUT WHAT ABOUT THE PHONE CALL? HUH? SADOWSKI COULDN'T HAVE KNOWN ALL THAT STUFF THAT BEN SAID THE GUY KNEW. CARLA, YOU CAN EASILY FIND THAT STUFF IN THE LIBRARY OR IN MILITARY RECORDS. LOOK WHAT I FOUND IN JUST A COUPLE HOURS. NO! CARLA, OPEN YOUR EYES. YOU WERE SO DESPERATE TO BELIEVE THAT LUNATIC, YOU CAN'T SEE WHAT'S RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOUR FACE. COME HERE. JUST COME HERE. SHH. NOW, LISTEN TO ME. MAYBE HE'S DANGEROUS, MAYBE HE'S NOT, BUT HE CAN'T BE THE ONLY DOCTOR THAT CAN HELP YOU, OK? WE WILL FIND SOMEBODY ELSE. WHERE? I DON'T KNOW. MOVE TO ANOTHER CITY, I DON'T CARE, CARLA. AS LONG AS YOU'RE SAFE. NOW, I MADE SOME COPIES OF THESE DOCUMENTS FOR THAT DETECTIVE. BUT I WANT YOU TO PROMISE ME SOMETHING. PROMISE ME THAT YOU WILL NOT GO SEE SADOWSKI IN THE MORNING, OK? I PROMISE. I LOVE YOU, CARLA. AND I'M NOT GONNA LOSE YOU. [RACHEL'S FLUTE MUSIC] [FLUTE] Rachel: CARLA... [FLUTE] [FLUTE] [FLUTE] HA HA HA HA! Rachel: CARLA! NO. NO. HA HA HA! Rachel: CARLA! NO. NO! NO! NO! Rachel: HEE HEE HEE HEE! YOU CAN'T LET GO OF ME! CARLA! [TELEPHONE RINGS] HELLO. HELLO. IS CARLA THERE? WHO IS THIS? UH, THIS IS DR. SADOWSKI. MAY I SPEAK TO YOUR WIFE, PLEASE? SHE'S NOT EVEN HERE, THANKS TO YOU. WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING WITH HER? WELL, DO YOU KNOW WHERE SHE IS? NO, I DON'T. WHERE WAS SHE SUPPOSED TO BE, ACCORDING TO YOU? WE HAVE AN APPOINTMENT. WHAT, AT THE CLINIC? NO. AS A MATTER OF FACT, I'M SUPPOSED TO MEET HER ON THE ROAD TO LOOKOUT MOUNTAIN. IF SHE CALLS IN WILL YOU TELL HER THAT, PLEASE? I'M GONNA BACK UP THERE AND WAIT FOR HER. NO! DON'T GO NEAR HER, YOU SON OF A BITCH, OR I SWEAR TO GOD, I WILL KILL YOU. Mark: YOU'RE GETTING A LITTLE CLOSE TO THE EDGE, SO COME OVER HERE AND SIT ON THE RAILING. Rachel: I AM NOT FALLING! I'M FINE! Echo: I'M FINE! I'M FINE! I'M FINE! OH, I FEEL LIKE I'M FLYING! AAH! RACHEL! PLEASE DON'T LET ME FALL. RACHEL, I'VE GOT YOU. AAH! CARLA, COME AWAY FROM THE EDGE. DON'T COME ANY CLOSER. CARLA, YOU'VE ALREADY DONE IT. YOU'RE CLOSE ENOUGH. YOU'VE WON. NO, THERE'S NO WINNING FOR ME. MAYBE YOU SHOULD COME WITH ME FOR ALL THE PEOPLE YOU FAILED ON THE MOUNTAIN. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT, CARLA? MOUNT RAINIER. LOOK, WE WERE ON A RIDGE 300 FEET FROM THE SUMMIT. WE WERE FOLLOWING AN ESTABLISHED ROUTE. THERE'S A BIG CORNICE OF SNOW AND ICE. IT GAVE ALL SIGNS OF BEING STABLE. I WENT FIRST. I CHECKED FOR CRACKS. HOW'D YOU DO IT, THEN? D'YOU CUT THE ROPE? WHAT? PUSH 'EM? NO! IT WAS NOTHING LIKE THAT AT ALL! THEN HOW DID THEY DIE? WHEN I STARTED BACK, THE ICE PACK STARTED TO FAIL. THE SECTION THEY WERE STANDING ON BROKE LOOSE. I LOOKED DOWN. IT HAPPENED SLOWLY. I THINK I COULD'VE SAVED THEM. I KNOW I COULD HAVE. I HAVE THE TRAINING, BUT... BUT WHEN I LOOKED DOWN, I COULDN'T MOVE. I COULDN'T EVEN BREATHE. I KNOW. I KNOW WHAT THAT KIND OF FEAR FEELS LIKE. WERE THEY YOUR FRIENDS? THEY WERE CLIENTS. ALL EXCEPT FOR ONE. WE WERE ENGAGED TO BE MARRIED A MONTH LATER. HOW DID YOU DO IT? HOW DID YOU GET OVER IT, THE FEAR, THE GUILT? I DIDN'T. WHEN I'M ALONE IN A HIGH PLACE, I'M AS DIZZY AND FRIGHTENED AS YOU ARE. BUT WHEN I'M TEACHING OTHER PEOPLE NOT TO BE AFRAID, I'M NOT AFRAID. IT'S OK. COME ON. COME ON. MARK! I TOLD YOU TO STAY AWAY FROM MY WIFE. MARK, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. WAIT, WAIT. WAIT A SECOND. I THINK THERE'S BEEN A MISUNDERSTANDING HERE. Carla: STOP IT, ALL RIGHT?! MARK, JUST LISTEN TO ME! HEY, BACK UP NOW. HOW DOES IT FEEL, DOCTOR, TO BE ON THE BRINK YOURSELF, THIS TIME, HUH? Carla: MARK, STOP IT! STOP IT. LOOK, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO CALM-- STOP IT, ALL RIGHT? CARLA, STAY BACK. MARK! MARK! MARK, STOP IT! MARK! HOLD ON, OK? HOLD ON! MARK, THERE'S A ROPE IN THE VAN. GET IT. UH... I DON'T THINK SO. LOOK, WHAT HAPPENED ON MOUNT RAINIER WAS AN ACCIDENT. ALL RIGHT? JUST GET THE ROPE! IT'LL BE A MINUTE. JUST HOLD ON. NONE OF THAT MATTERS, CARLA. YOU KNOW... YOU COULD'VE MADE THIS A WHOLE LOT EASIER... IF YOU'D HAVE JUST DONE WHAT I SAID IN THE FIRST PLACE. WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU? YOU DON'T GET IT, DO YOU? I TOLD YOU TO SIT ON THE RAILING. I RIGGED IT TO BREAK FOR YOU, NOT RACHEL. YOU KILLED RACHEL. NO. YOU DID. YOU'RE THE ONE WHO DIDN'T SIT ON THE RAILING LIKE I TOLD YOU TO! YOU WANTED ME TO FALL? WHY? AAH! WHEN I MET YOU, I DIDN'T HAVE 2 NICKELS TO RUB TOGETHER. YOU HAD YOUR PARENTS' MONEY AND THAT BIG OLD HOUSE. AND I COULD'VE HAD ALL THAT. EVEN RACHEL IF I WANTED. SHE WAS SO MUCH MORE CONTROLLABLE. YOU... YOU'RE STUBBORN. YOU MAKE EVERYTHING A MESS. THAT'S WHY WHEN THE DOCTOR CAME ALONG, I FIGURED, "HEY, HOW MUCH MORE PERFECT COULD THIS BE?" A GUY WHO LIKES TO PUT PEOPLE ON CLIFFS AND SEE IF THEY'LL JUMP? THAT'S BEAUTIFUL. FROM THEN ON, I HAVE TO SAY IT WAS ACTUALLY KIND OF FUN. I KNEW YOU WERE TERRIFIED OF COMING DOWN WITH YOUR MOTHER'S MENTAL ILLNESS, SO I JUST HELPED YOU ALONG A LITTLE BIT BY DOSING YOU FROM TIME TO TIME WITH THE WORST HALLUCINOGENIC I COULD FIND. THEN ALL I HAD TO DO WAS SIT BACK AND WATCH YOU FREAK OUT! ADD A BIT OF SUGGESTION... A LITTLE INCENSE HERE... MOVE THE SCARF THERE. THE REST OF IT WAS YOUR IMAGINATION. OH. THEN THERE WAS THAT DAMN GROUP... AND ALL THEIR SUPPORT. THEY HAD TO GO. AAH! AAH! AAH! YOU SHOULD'VE PICKED AN AMATEUR. AAH! CARLA! Dr. Sadowski: HANG ON! GIVE ME YOUR HAND! GIVE ME YOUR HAND, CARLA. THE ROOT WON'T HOLD! IT'S GONNA BREAK! LET HIM GO! CARLA, GIVE ME YOUR HAND! GIVE ME YOUR HAND! MARK! MARK, PULL ME UP! MARK! AAH! AAH! AAH! TAKE MY HAND. COME ON, CARLA. TAKE MY HAND. DO IT! AAH! HANG ON! CLIMB THE ROPE, CARLA. CLIMB IT. COME ON, CLIMB IT! CARLA, YOU CLIMB THAT ROPE NOW! YOU'RE FINE. YOU'RE FINE, CARLA. IT'S OK. BYE, RACHEL. [RACHEL'S FLUTE] Rachel: CARLA...
