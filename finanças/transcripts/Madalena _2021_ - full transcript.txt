Stop lying to yourself I didn't lie to myself You did No, I didn't You did, you couldn't let go You were just using me to replace your wife I didn't think of you as her No matter what I did, you'd think that I was lying to you From the first day we met You knew how much money meant to me You beating him up today Caused me to lose my job You beating him up I didn't think of you as her You know that I have to provide for my mother and Little Yuk But you're just the same as her You cheat men for their money You want my ID, you're both whores Do you know why I came to the restaurant today? I withdrew all the money I had I wanted to leave Macau with you, and go home. I wanted to start all over with you Since I was a kid I've been all alone Until I met you Then I thought... maybe life isn't so bad after all I thought I deserved happiness Do you know how hard it was to stand back up? Why? Why? Why did it have to be you? Don't come looking for me ever again We're done Mixed stir fry Madame Tai, let me introduce you This is my woman Lena, isn't she stunning?

Look at you now, who would want to? Where is she? She got train tickets and left this morning Madame Tai told me you'd be here I still have something I need to pack I was gonna tell you Once I've settled down But it's good that you're here You'll drive me, right? This suitcase sucks I've only used it twice and it's broken I need to catch a train I quit my job I'm sorry, let's not break up I won't ask about this anymore. That time I was at the hotel I was meeting Little Yuk's father's subordinate I wanted to protect our relationship So my past doesn't come to haunt us I know you don't like to be lied to But I've done this to you I told you that... I came to Macau because of a man After a while I gave birth to Little Yuk He gambled a lot, and was in massive debt He made me work as a prostitute to pay off the debt. I didn't agree, so he brought his buddies, and raped me right in front of Little Yuk I was only 24 years old I didn't know how to face it So I could only lie to myself And pretend nothing ever happened I actually hate it here I came back just to earn some quick money With no emotional attachments to anything Until I met you You make me feel hopeful for our future. But when I saw how much you've suffered becasue of me, I knew I had to tell you. But do you understand, once I come clean Every time I see you I'll think about my past If both of us are so miserable Why don't you let me go? We can start our lives over. Use this money to open a restaurant You know that I won't take it Forget everything here and go back to live a good life with Little Yuk. You're beautiful when you smile That's a beautiful drawing, mummy will treat you some ice cream, okay? Okay Table for one?
