That's the fourth quarter right there. So tell me, Kate. Why do you want to work here? Well, I thought I could make a difference and- - That's great, and so did I. You can't make a difference in the world without money. You want to feed the kids in Africa? You're gonna need money. You want to clean the water in Thailand? You're gonna need money. You want to save the South American three-toed tree frog? What are you gonna need? Money? Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding! That's right, money. And that's what we do. Without money, there is no business. There is no adventure, there is no making a difference. There's no saving the tree frogs. Tree frogs are dead, money. Ding, ding, ding, ding! You can't make a difference in the world without money. Money, money. Shipyards, power plants, steel factories, medical imaging. Money, money, we're gonna make money. We are prepared to offer you a position at this firm. I'm gonna have to say no. - No? Did she just say no? - I really appreciate it but I just, I can't. I can't breathe in this coat and- - I mean, you're exactly what we're looking for. I know, I know, and there are 1000 applicants who would shave their right arm off for this position, I'm sure. But it's not me. It's my parents. They want me to be successful and self-sufficient. See, I'm an actress. And I like drama and comedy. And show tunes. And these clothes, I cannot breathe in. And if I can't breathe, then I can't live, can I? Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Mendelson. Oh, and good luck with the money. Well. That was different. - You need this more than me. - Penny. Could you send up someone who actually wants the job? Jo, I'm coming to the fair. Blue 19.

Yo, you better have him sign off on that, Will, because if you don't, you're not starting next year. If you don't start, no NFL. All right guys, ready? ♪ Huddle up, huddle up ♪ ♪ Go team, go team, go team, go ♪ Who am I supposed to hike to? Literature is the lifeblood of learning. So I close this course on the Renaissance with words from the Bard. Be not afraid of greatness. Some are born great. Some will achieve greatness. And others will have greatness thrust upon them. So I say unto you, go forth and flourish. Class dismissed. Plenty of me to go around, ladies. Just take a piece and move it on, huh? Oh, I see, ladies. Oh, it's the volleyball team. Bring it inside. Bump, set, spike, guys. Bump it, set it, I'll spike it myself. Oh, you guys are terrible. - Call me, Will. - Professor Shockworthy, - how you doing? - Ah. Mr. William Pepperidge, the great quarterback. What brings you by my humble classroom? Surely not a desire for knowledge. Nah man, I got all the knowledge I need right here. I just need you to sign off on my absences so I can start next season. Do you recall how many classes you actually attended? Zero? Touchdown, exactly. I didn't even know you were in my class. Listen, all my other teachers already signed. I am not other teachers. You're not gonna make me go to summer school, are you? I mean, that's... Well sadly, I won't be teaching summer school this year. But I will be attending the Ye Olde Times Renaissance Pleasure Fair. You mean one of those places where the dorks sword fight and wear the tights? Oh man. Yes, tights. - Tights, so stupid. - Yeah. Similar to the ones you're wearing now. That's a good one, Professor Shockworthy. I thought so. Are you really going to a Renaissance fair? Yes. And so are you. There's no way I'm going to one of those dork-a-thons with you. My friend is the proprietor of said dork-a-thon. And I'm sure she'll be more than happy to give you a job at the fair once I appraise her of your predicament. I see what you're doing here, Professor Shockworthy. I'm gonna go to the fair and I'm gonna get a turkey leg and I'm gonna walk around and I'm gonna grow as a person. And then I'm gonna understand everything that you wanted to teach me and it's gonna be great. So why don't we just skip all that and just go ahead and just sign away? That would be nice. That's not why I'm doing this. I'm asking you to do this because I like to harass spoiled, dumb little athletes who get everything handed to them! So what are we talking about here, a day? Three weeks. And I'll be there watching your every step. Come on, man, please don't do this to me. Oh no, I didn't do this to you, William. You did this to yourself. Now you work at the fair and you play football next season. Take it or leave it. I guess I'll take it. Oh fret not, Mr. Pepperidge. The fair is a magical place. You'll love it. Where else can a dishwasher become a royal? Or a librarian become a witch? People from all walks of life come to experience the values of the Renaissance. Huzzah! Take that! Well, we're gonna have to get you out of those clothes. - Jo! - Hi, hi! So glad you made it. - How you doing? - Good, good. Hi, Benny. You look beautiful, I love that dress. Thank you. Wait 'til you see the one I've got for you. - Yay. - Come on. I've got to get you ready for the play. I'm so happy you're here. Me too. So I guess the guys here are pretty hot. - Oh my God. - Hey, I'm Horny! That's great, man. No, that's my name, you big dummy. Horny, don't be rude. I'm Jester Roy. And of course, you met Horny. And welcome! To the Renaissance Pleasure Fair. Dude, you can take it down a notch if you want. Cool. I'm gonna be working here and they told me I have to find a queen. Ooh, the queen. Her Royal Highness, Her Majesty. I shall take you to her. In fact, I shall ride you like a royal steed. Tally-ho! Are you serious right now? He's serious, dude, go. Oh my God. Oh there it is, the queen's castle. Looks like a dump to me. Ahoy there, matey. Giddy up, nave! Hi everybody, look at my new horsey. He's fuel efficient, very green, and allows us to be less dependent on foreign oil. He's like a Prius with hair gel. That's awesome. Halt, who goes there? I go here. And I go bye-bye. Hi, my name's Will Pepperidge. I was sent here- This is the young man - I told you about. - By Professor Shockworthy to meet a queen. Ah, yes. The bad student. We've been expecting thee. Sweet. You may approach. Thank you. Hi, I'm so glad that you're a queen and everything and it's really nice to meet you. You will address me as Your Majesty. Seriously? Yes, Your Majesty. Now kneel, nave. Listen ma'am, I just met you. I don't typically kneel. Kneel before the queen! Now I'm definitely gonna do it 'cause that guy yelled at me. Step forward. Okay. Now listen to me. Professor Shockworthy told me that you might be a little unwilling to play along. So I'm telling you now, kid. Either you believe in the fair and all the hierarchy within it, or you'll be fired and fail your class. Got it? Yeah I got it, thank you. Well, what a humble peasant. Indeed. Now, those who work here are divided into two camps. The upper class, who enjoy the privileges of nobility, and the lower class, who perform the less desirable tasks. I've assigned you to the lower class, where you will work as a fetch boy. Sounds like a lot of fun. And at the end of the fair, we hold the grand finale in which all of the members of the shire perform. And I expect you to participate as well. I'll be there, Your Majesty. Ah, Your Majesty! Your beauty shines like that of the summer sun. Oh, such a beauteous visage. 'Tis the stuff of poetry. Sonnets, literature, such as, oh, for a muse of fire- - Yes, yes, yes, Prince Rank. Your excessive compliments will have to wait. I'm having an audience with the new fetch boy. So glad you're here, fetch boy. I've run out of toilet paper. Now I'll use you to wipe my buttocks for me. Why don't I just kick those buttocks, how does that sound? Why don't I kick that boyish face? Enough! Guards, take this new fetch boy to his quarters. Get him properly attired and confiscate those street clothes. You're gonna make me wear one of these coffee filters? Be gone with you. I'll fix thee. In your dreams, weird guy. Ramon, I tell you. It's people like that that make me twirl my mustache. Si. We've reached the camp. Whose underwear is all that? Princess Jeanette. - Hi Jo, hey. - Hi, ladies. - This is my cousin, Kate. - Hi, Kate. Home sweet home. Oh wow. Wow, it's so pretty. I know, right? Is that my bed? - Uh-huh. - Yeah? I brought in some things of my own. Oh my God. Tell me that's my dress. I love it. I knew you'd love it. I do, I love it. It's so pretty. Oh. Oh God. You know what this reminds me of? What? When we used to play dress-up when we were kids in England. Oh my goodness, yeah. Don't you miss it there? What, miserable weather and rubbish food? No. And don't even get me started on the men. Well, what happened to that guy you were seeing? Oh, is that the time? - Jo? - Are you hungry? You must be starving. There's this really good turkey leg stand - I want to take you to. - Oh my God. What? He's here. - Forget it. - He's here, isn't he? Forget about it, I have. And what about you? Are you still seeing that guy that used to play Xbox all the time? No. He played Xbox all day and for some reason, I thought he was living some kind of ironic lifestyle. That he was smart and sarcastic and dry. But he was actually just a stupid person. Great. I just want to meet somebody who is exactly who they seem to be. No assumptions, just they tell you who they are and you can believe it. Come on, nave. - Easy. - Let's go. - Easy, buddy. - Move it, fetch boy. What the hell is this place? - Up the stairs. - Shouldn't you kids be playing Dungeons and Dragons? Go! You know you're dressed like a clown, right? Like a small clown? Get back to the castle. - The queen beckons. - What's up, man? Oh, look who it is, everybody. This is the new fetch boy I was telling you about. Fetch boy, everybody. Everybody, fetch boy. Hey, guys. I'm not a big fan of fetch boy. Fetchling? Fetchenburg. No. Fetchenstein. Will. Not really close to any of those. - Will Fetcherson? - Is he always crazy? Yeah, every single day he's. - Hey, Will. - Hey. - I'm Rusty Crockett. - Nice to meet you, man. You're the fetch boy. I'm kind of in charge of you for the summer. Allow me to officially welcome you to the peasant world of the green briars, also known as the lower class. That sounds great. Rusty Crockett? Ow! Natalia, is that you? Oh hi, I never could've guessed. Long time no see, how was your year off? Ow, that's my hair! Why are you cutting my hair? This is for your cheating heart. I don't have a cheating heart. I have a very nice heart, ask these guys. I'm a nice-hearted guy, aren't I? You told us we were special. You are, you're special. You're all very special. You will pay for this, Crockett. What? You have abused your gifts, Rusty Crockett. - Gifts? - Gifts that have brought you much pleasure and fame. So in accordance with the laws of the cosmic womb, I invoke the power of Lilith to curse you. The very next time you use your manhood, it will separate from you and fall to the ground like a lonely twig. Separate from me? Like a twig, what does that mean? I believe it means the junk in your trunk shall be defunct. Can't we negotiate something here? I mean, other than burning my hair? It's too late. Fire, fire! More fire, more fire! God. It is done. Long live the curse! Was that a real curse? No, no, no, no, not a curse. What was that thing? - That was hot. - What the hell was that? Who are they? The witches. They're the witches, they're bonafide witches. They live out in the forest. They're not bonafide. She's just like one of those goth chicks at the mall. She did the thing and the thing and the Lilith and then the thing is gonna fall. Your wang is gonna be fine, man. Says you! Ooh, ooh, you know what we need to do? We need to get the witch's book and break the curse. I've gotta get that book back. If I get that book back, there's gotta be some kind of uncurse thing in the book, right? We gotta go, come on. We gotta get the book, you're with me. There's nothing wrong with your ding dong, bro. I'm not taking a chance 'cause there is a possibility. No, they're not bonafide. - It looks amazing. - I love it. There's your boyfriend. Yeah, thanks. I know, I'm sorry. That's definitely your boyfriend. That's Carl, he's a creep. From the beginning of time, witches have had these kinds of powers. Right. Hi. Hey, Jo. Crockett. This is my cousin, Kate. - Hi. - It's her first fair. I'm sorry, I'm Crockett. - I'm Kate. - Hi, Kate. - I'm Will. - Hi, Kate. This is the new fetch boy. Oh, I'm the new fetch girl. We both fetch. I like your tights. It's not my tights. You're wearing another man's tights? No, they're not anyone's tights. Okay. Is that a dog? Hey, buddy. - It's Benny. - Hey, Benny. He fetches too. So we were just on our way. We've got, I just got cursed. These witches cursed my- - Weenus. - My weenus. My weenus is in danger of falling off. So we have to go. - We do. - Fix the thing. Yeah? Cool, bye. They're not my tights. God, I hope his weenus is okay. Natalia, do you know where my crystal ball is? Mm-mm. I think I left it in the van, come on. The book. Here it is, a curse of the fallen loins. Rub the freshly spilled urine of a goat on your loins at midnight. - It's right there. - Natalia, wait. - Go, go. - I forgot my keys, I'll be right there. Come on, here they come. You hold that side, it's- - Are you familiar with the term make believe? Dude, we're talking about my little man here. It's always been there for me. I'm not gonna turn my back on it now. Oh, peasants. Time for your chores. Hey Rank, how's it going, pal? Crockett, so sorry to hear about your potentially fallen phallus. The whole fair is abuzz with talk of your ding dong. I thought it only fitting for you to sell pickles today. Oh, that's good. You get it? Pickles. 'Cause I'm having a curse thing going on, right? That's a good one, Rank. You're so funny. You get it, go on now. Off you go, sell some pickles. Yes, my liege, of course. Anon, good luck. Have fun, man. And now, prepare for loneliness. Who put you in charge, weird guy? - Weird guy? - Weird guy. Weird guy? I mean, you're obviously a very weird guy. You will address me as sir or sire or lord! Okay, Lord Weird Guy. Listen to me, I'm a noble and you are a peasant. And a lowly one at that. Now, before you do your chores, allow me to introduce to you my royal legion of allegiance. He maybe short in stature, but he's grandiose in ferocity. Count Le Petite. Je m'appelle Count Le Petite. I will cut you where it hurts. Whoa, easy, buddy. Wonderful, CLP. Wonderful. Like a pearl from the orient. Like fine china from China. The fierce warrior, General Tso. And last but certainly not least, my most trusted ally, the Rosecrantz to my Guildenstern, the Proteus to my Valentine. The menace from Mexico. Jamón del diablo. Well done, guys. Those are great intros. Now, I totally respect you, respect all of you. Mock us all you like, but your future is in my hands. Okay, man, so what do you want me to do? I thought you'd come around. Petite, Tso, keep an eye of the peasants. Go on, now. It's really good to meet you guys. Maybe we can all go trick or treating later. It begins. What? You want me to go that way? Yes. Sir, stupid dance. Did you just say something? I'm listening. Hey, can you guys hold up for a second? Thanks, just gotta grab the arrows. Fire!

And last year Stratford beat us in the Grand Finale and so now they're nobles all summer. Yes, we've lost five years in a row. But if we get our act together, maybe we can win something this year. It's tradition for fetch boy and fetch girl to do something together. Oh yeah. All we can do is fetch pretty much, right? Let's try something. Come on! Oh, yeah. Come on, fetchy. I like to watch and sit. Come on. Get up here stat. Let's see what you're made of. I mean, we've seen what you're made of. We could get you - some loser tights. - Shut up, Horny. She is- - Riding a motorcycle. No, it's a horse. That's a horse. Oh, she has hit her head on a low lying branch. Are you okay? Elizabethan English only, sir. Are you'th okay'th? Dude, that suck'th. Oh, kind sir. I am so grateful for you coming to my rescue. My pleasure'th. You have been hit with a non-talking spell. Kapow. I've waited for this moment all my life. Now you can finally tell me all those deep dark secrets you've been holding inside. Yes. I hit you with a spell. No talking! Just die. Just fake death. Always a good call. Oh, he's pulled the dagger. Oh. Dead. And he's out. Poison I see. Hath been, his time has end. Oh child, drunk all and left no friendly drop to help me after. I will kiss thy lips. She's pretty good, you know? I know, right? Yes, she's brilliant. Will is not bad either. Thy lips are warm. Ye know'th? Thy I will be brief. Oh happy dagger, this is thy sheath. Thy rust and let me die. Poof. Will, you are alive again. A kiss will revive her. You want me to actually kiss her? Kiss her. Like in real life? Just do it! Put a little tongue into it. Shut up. Is it okay if I kiss you? Yeah, it's okay. And then we take a bow. Bravo. Bravo, Kate. Your grasp of the audience is breathtaking. Stolen my breath. This boy, awful. Excellent job, both of you. Bravo. But now I think it's time the fetch boy and I do a little scene of our own at my room. Jeanette, just stop it. Stop what, Jo? It's the fetch boy's job to please me. And I think it's right about that time. So, I'll see you in my room in 10 minutes. Get off me, I'm fine. Have that step removed. Kate, Kate, Ka-ta-ri. Your performance was brilliant. Your inflection, eloquent. Not perfect, but some fews are. Sure is promising. Perhaps I could arrange for a private tutorial. Just a little one on one. Easy buddy, don't touch her. No. That's right, fetch boy. You have anything to say to me, go ahead and say it to Jamóns fist. You're a very creepy guy. Okay, all right. That's enough. He was a total cock block. You rubbed her cheek with your hand. That's a total invasion of her personal space. I'll invade your personal space. Put those nunchucks away. You're all right. No, you may not talk to a member of the noble class in that tone. - Oh. - No, stop it. - Stop it. - No. No, I did not say that. Oh, I don't. Stop it. Oh, look at that it's midnight. - Midnight. - Good night. You really sound just like that. Don't let that fetch boy just fetch himself up or he will be in trouble. Team. Away. A kiss will revive her? I didn't see you complaining. What? I didn't want to embarrass him. You loved it. - I did not. - Yes, you did. So what did Jeanette mean when she said that I had to please her? That was just like drunk talk, right? It was drunk talk, but you do have to please her. Traditionally, in Renaissance times, any virgin, anywhere at anytime had to bed the king if he so desired. If not the king, then the queen. But see, as our faire doesn't have a king and the queen is off-limits. You are Jeanette's play-thing. Play-thing? I've never considered myself a play-thing. Okay, let's get some goat pee to break the curse. All right, what do you think? We got to pick one, right? That's a goat, a goat. That's a sheep. It is disqualified if it's a sheep. It's that one. We got 10 minutes. Let's do it. You stay there while I corral this guy towards you. He's coming, he's coming, he's coming. - He's got horns, man. - Okay, pick him up. How am I supposed to pick him up? Pick him up and hold him. We're going to get a nice stream of pee coming out of his wiener right there. I think, right now, the best thing to do is maybe tickle him or hug him really strong. Come on, buddy. Whatever you do, don't pee on my face. Try to pee down on this area. Oh, gross. Not in my face. Yes. Pee on him. That's enough. Stop peeing. Oh, my God. It smells terrible. It worked. Good job. The Renaissance Pleasure Faire is now officially open. Open the gates. The Pleasure Faire! Oh, so close. That was really close. What? Don't do anything. I'm not. I'm just encouraging the kids. Let the kids have their fun. It's for kids. All right, see if you can hit that. Oh, they're close though. I'd never do that. Why would I do that to you? I would never- - Oh boy. Whoa. One, two, three. Master, do you believe in love? Yes. You do! My lady, he believes in love. There is no such thing as true love. True love comes and goes with the wind. If you can't make it in love what chance do I have? Life without love is like a tree without fruit. Thank you. Enjoy your time at the faire. - Next. - Hey, man. That's a sweet hat. - Hey. - Hi. What's this all about? Kiss the Wench? No way. I don't like it that they call you a wench though. It's good plank work, man. You're doing a great job. You're really good out there. Would you stop bothering my customers? - I'm encouraging them. - You're warm. - Thank you. - Good work, buddy. - Enjoy the faire. - First base. Next. So, what do you say after this whole thing we grab a beer? Thanks, but no. Because I thought that last night we really connected. No. It was a bit of a moment. Remember? When- Oh, in the scene. You kissed me. Yeah, but I was acting. I thought you were acting like you were pretty into me. Sir Rank enters, finally. Oh, walk the plank and kiss the wench. Sounds like a lark. Command. Assistance. - He's acting. - Gracias, hombre. Like a swan. Oh, my God. I hope he falls. As expected, I crossed with ease. Now, my prize. Mmm. I'm ready. Lovely. One more. Bravo. What's that? Encore, encore. Shall I, dear? I am a noble. You shall put me down at once. Put him down immediately. Your Majesty! Your second day and you've already made a mockery of this fair. But he started it. To the stocks with you. Stocks? He should be beheaded. Okay, come on. This is the man I was telling you about. Oh, hey, Kate. Very bad, mean ogre. What's with the basket and the fruit? Are we having a picnic today, kids? One. - Two. - Hey come on. That's not cool. That's not nice. I love them. Come on, man. They're vegetables, kids. Could you not throw them at me? Oh, no. The kid in the vest has an arm. He's not a kid, he's at least 13. That's great. Thanks, guys. Go find your parents. Tell them you all need counseling. You enjoyed yourself? That was fun for you? Yeah, it was kind of fun. How about you unlock me now? How does that sound? Why should I? Because the only reason I'm in here is that I defended your honor in front of Rank. You did and I do appreciate it. He really is a jerk. He is. You know who's not a jerk? This guy. So, why don't you unlock this lock so that I can get out of here? Mmmm. You are in a rather compromising position. Why, you want to spank me? Don't tempt me. Your butt is looking pretty good right now. I didn't want to be the one who said it. Okay. Oh. How did that feel, bad boy? That was really good. Have you been naughtier than that? Not a lot naughtier but I've been pretty naughty. Want a lot more of that, wherever that came from. Oh, wow, Kate. How about that one, big guy? Not bad, you really got into that one. Oh, hey, oh my God. No hands. No hands? What is going on? What are you doing? Good day, master. Was it good for you? Dude, I'm gonna kick your ass. Don't forget to call me. I'm going to kick your ass. Dude, I'm going to kill you. ♪ Everything, I give it all away ♪ ♪ Anything I would give for you ♪ Oh, that place looks really safe. ♪ 'Cause I was meant to love ♪ ♪ Yeah, I was meant to love you ♪ Yeah, my parents wanted me to study business administration. They want me to work on Wall Street. They think the faire is just a waste of time. It is a little silly. What do you mean? It's beautiful. You're such a loser. Watch out. That's my throwing arm. Oh. Did you always want to be a football player? Yeah. You know, my dad wanted me to be a classical pianist like him, but not for me. Can you play the piano? My dad made me play every day. I was playing Bach when I was five. I always wanted to play catch with my friends on the street. So what did you do? You just stood up to him? Pretty much, yeah. - On the port side. - Si. No, you're overshooting. I'm okay. Of course I'm all right. Great, it's Captain Morgan. So sorry to interrupt your sunny soirée. But the fetch boy is needed to pick up road apples. There's no way I'm leaving her alone with you and your mustache. Well then, I'll just have you fired. How about that? I can handle his mustache. Fare thee well, fetch boy. Tata. Fare thee not well. Fare thee not well. Yes, "Fare thee not well". Good one. Darling, Kate. Please sit. Join me for a spot of picnic. Yes. Gracias, Jamón. My dear. Over the years I've had the fortune to work with many talented actresses. Last night when I saw your performance for Juliet's death scene, despite the fact that you were opposite of giant oaf, I was mesmerized. This is why I'm here today. I would like you to play Juliet opposite to my Romeo at this year's grand finale. I'm flattered. But I'm on the peasants team, so how would that work? Surely, we can make an exception for such an actress. Such beauty, grace, panache. I have always wanted to play Juliet. Haven't we all? I perform with the peasant's team, so I'm going to have to say no. All right, then. Lovely chatting with you. I thought we made a real connection today. My hat! Pick up my hat and place it on my head. Oh God, that felt great. Whoo! Road apples. Yeah, I've learned my lesson, professor. Don't go to class or shovel poo all day, you are a genius. You are a genius, Shockworthy. So, isn't the faire everything you dreamed of? I do love it and it is everything I imagined. Except for Rank. I know, right? He asked me to play Juliet in the grand finale. But Jeanette always plays Juliet. And anyway, you're on our team. You'll be helping them win. I don't see that happening. As long as Will is around, anyway. You are so horny for him. I'm not. I saw the way you looked at him when he kissed you. That was acting. Well, then you're a really good actor. Yeah, I am. You're amazing. You're gonna win the Oscar. Get away from her. Hey, hold fire, dragon. Hey! Unhand thy lady. Shoo, dragon. Me thinks you have been at the tavern too long today. Let go of her. Hey! Get off, dude. Let go of her, man. Stupid dragon. That happens, man. Mistress, I have slayed thy foul dragon. Thank you, kind sir. No worries. Huzzah! Huzzah! Get him! Get him! Ye old Miller time. So, Will, did you satisfy tradition and please Jeanette? Not a big fan of your creepy little tradition. Better honor it or you're going to get fired. Why don't you just do it, man? Why don't you do it for me? It's your job. I mean you are the fetch boy. Do you think she'd really have me fired? I'd rather set you on fire if it were up to me. Hey. I was just wondering, where is Rank? Well, off you go to Jeanette's trailer. All right. I'll go in that trailer. But I feel really degraded. So, Rank, how's the beer? Thank you for the libation, Horny. What? - No tip? - Here's a tip. Ditch the doofus. You are alike. Kind of attached. Kind of attached. Love it. Who is it? It's Will. I'm here to please you. Come hither. Hither. I thought you'd never show up. Listen, I don't know about this whole tradition thing. Not a big fan. Okay. What is going down? Whoa. You know what to do with this. You want me to polish your nails? Don't worry. I don't bite. Want me to start with the big toe? - Yeah. - Okay. Really? Oh, yeah. Say I'm a pretty princess. You're a pretty princess. Oh yeah. This one went to market. This one. - That one had roast beef. - Oh yeah, he did. This one went all the way home. He did. He went all the way home. All the way home. I know there's something going on with you and Crockett. Crockett. How long have you guys known each other? Well, it was our first faire. We performed in the grand finale together and won. It was amazing. We got to be nobles the following year. - But it didn't work out. - Why not? Well, let's just say it was undone by certain tradition. Jeanette? - Yeah. - Ugh. She's a cow. Must have every man she sets her eyes on- Crockett just wasn't strong enough to say no. Oh yeah, oh yeah! Oh yeah! Okay. Jesus. Horny, what are you doing? - Smoking a cigarette. - No, no. All the doctors say that smoking is bad for you, Horny. We must extinguish this immediately. Oh. See, it says right here. The curse of the fallen loins. There's actually a picture. I know. It's disgusting, right? Look what it says. Goat urine does work but it could take up to six to eight week to take effect. "Could" is not a good word. "Could" is a bummer. Oh, I got it. I got the perfect solution. I'll be right back. So maybe, does that mean I am no longer- - Here, put this on. What is it, Horny? It's a chastity belt from the chicks. I don't think that will work at all, Horny. Six to eight weeks will fly by with this thing. Yeah, especially when you have metal on your wiener. Good job, Horny. Give me a hug, buddy. They're not real witches. Are you a real witch? Yes. So, make my sister disappear. Magic powers of the air with the spell make her disappear. Mom! Can I come out now? All right, come on out. Thanks. Good girl. Hear ye, hear ye. The joust tournament is about to begin. Two tickets to the joust, right here, come on. Two tickets to the joust. You want two tickets to the joust? Hey you, you! Come here. - Who me? - Or me? Both of you. Come here. Two tickets to the joust. I'll give you 100. Sold. Let's go. Yay! I win. 100. As agreed upon. Come on, come on. What the hell is this? That is 100 magic beans- - As agreed upon. Welcome oh gentles to the tournament of knights. Turkey legs. Turkey legs. They're kind of warm. They're not super bad. Want that? That's a smart move right there. Smart lady. Yeah. Turkey legs. Oh! Turkey legs, I love turkey legs. Oh, Crockett. What's up, man? What's going on? Can I sit down? Yeah, it's the joust. Good start. Rest your turkey legs. Knights, to your rings. Knights at the ready! Charge! Ah! He's cut his head clean off. I am, how you say, okay. Ah! No man can best me. - I'm unstoppable. - Please. What a medieval jerk. All the time jerks. I am all that is power. All that is man. I am virile. I will impregnate all of you. That's right, even the men. I can't take this anymore, man. It's going down. Hey, Rank. Yes? Why don't you pick on somebody your own size? Like me. What's he doing? Oh, so sorry, kind sir. Alas. We're not accepting challenges at this time. Thank you though. Very flattered. We can't do it though. But thank you. What's the matter, Rank? Chicken! Yes, chicken. Alas, the Pleasure Faire doesn't carry insurance for this sort of thing. Not really my call. I'd love to. Really I would. But I can't. I'd love to. But I can't. Let them joust! Let them joust! I will vanquish thee. So, can I ask you a kind of a stupid question? Yeah, totally. You ever jousted before? No, I haven't. Take this moment to say goodbye forever. Are you ready? I'm going to be fine, man. I got chest plates. The horse is just like a car. A big hairy car. Roll over. - Yes, all right. - Here's your helmet. You want to put that on. Squire, get me his lance. Yeah, that one. You want to put that face thing down. How do I make it walk? Grab him and kick in the ass, you just go that way. - That way. - Come on, baby. Make sure Kate is watching, bro. Dead man riding. Prepare to be lanced. A lot. Ah. It's a pretty good joke. For an idiot. You're the idiot. You're an idiot. They're both idiots. Fetch boy, to your ring. Knight, to your ring. Is jousting a skill that can come naturally to people? No, it takes years. Knights at the ready. Charge! His stick is broken. That means he lost, right? He needs that. He's still on the horse. So technically, no. Will, get off the horse. Fall off the horse. I can't do that, Kate. I don't know how. I am victorious, yet again. Ha! He's not moving. Kate, my darling. Come mount this noble steed, then me. Where are you going? Will? Will? Are you okay? Did I win? No. You came in second. Did I look cool? What is wrong with you? I just got so fired up. You could've been killed. You look amazing. You're an ass. You're an angel. Here you go. Nice cup of tea. That really was the stupidest thing I've ever seen in my life. Congratulations. So, tell me, how are you feeling there, you big brave knight? Can't believe I lost to that guy. Yeah. You want to bring him down, you beat him at the grand finale. If you guys haven't noticed yet, I'm not much of an actor. I'm not much of a jouster. Not a lot of I can bring to the table. Stop being such a big baby. We can do it. I am not a baby. You're a little bit of a baby. I'm not a baby. Look at him. What is he wearing? He's like some kind of big, dumb, giant baby. - I'll be back. - Where are you going? We're in the middle of a show. Hey, guys. What's going down? What's going on? Just having some breakfast. You're wearing a bonnet. I'm not wearing a bonnet, bro. It's a little hat. Just a little hat. What's with the bib? This? This is not a bib. It's like a tiny shirt. Nope, that's clearly a bib. It's not a bib. Fetch boy? I said, "fetch boy". Oh, she must be talking to you. Fetch boy. Yes, your Majesty. There seems to be some mud in my path. Would you be so kind as to help me with it? Ah that is a bummer, your Majesty, because I don't have a jacket, so I can't be super chivalrous. You'll do. I will do. What do you mean by that? I said, you will do. You want me to lay in that mud for you? Yes. Right now? Now. - You want me to- - Yes. Totally hurt himself. He's got a coat. Happy birthday to me. Always remember that faire comes first. Well done, fetch boy. Can't say no to the queen. Who's calling the blade now? Such a psycho. Little bastard. What's the point of that? Oh, you got to be kidding me. ♪ Everybody dance now ♪ Check this guy out. ♪ Everybody dance now ♪ Later, fetch boy. ♪ Give me the music ♪ Where are your friends now? Hey! It is enough. Sorry, your Majesty. Of course. Now, come along. We should help him. Oh, my God, Will. It's so cold. Do you have any idea how many people would kill to be stepped on by the queen? None? No, lots. Seriously. Dude, are you all right? There's stuff all over. By the way, bro, that Rank dude, he's going down, man. What we need to do is kick his ass in the grand finale. Dude, I'm so down to kick his ass, bro. You and Kate have to get together some kind of really good scene. Okay. He danced on me. Okay. We should probably work on what we're going to do for the grand finale. Totally. I can act. What can you do? I can throw a football insanely far. Great. I can also ask where a bathroom is in Spanish. And then they point. I don't think that's going to help us. Oh I shall no longer be a Montague. Capulet! The line is Capulet. Blast, this is just not working. I'm not feeling it, darling. Why? Whatever is wrong? This new fetch girl, Kate, poses an actual threat to our dynasty. Her talent alone could dethrone us. We must step it up. I can step it up! Well, step's is the only thing you need. Why must you drown yourself in the bottles of liquor? Drown yourself in the prose of William Shakespeare. Like I have. Are you implying that I have a drinking problem? I'm telling you. You have a drinking problem. This brings back memories, huh? What happened to us, Crockett? I made a mistake. I screwed up. Did I ever tell you I was sorry? No, you didn't. Allow me to take this moment, my lady. I am so sorry, Jo. Maybe it's not too late. What are you wearing? What is that? Chastity belt. For the curse? Yeah, the curse. Why don't you just reverse it? You know, to undo a curse all you have to do is do it in reverse. Reverse the curse? Everybody knows that. That's a great idea. Why are we going to the witch's? The foolproof method to reverse the curse is to burn a lock of hair from the witch that cursed me and blow it back in her face. - Really? - Yes. I thought you said it was to have goat pee on you. I made a mistake. This is it. Let's go. Come on. See? Ah, there were strippers in the renaissance. They're not strippers, they're witches. Bona fide witches. They're bona fide strippers. Give me my scissors. I have to get a lock of her hair to reverse the curse. - If they're real witches- - I'm a little scared anyway. You shouldn't be at all. What if they turn me into, like, a pig? Yeah, what if they turn you into like a pig? Like they do all this crazy portions stuff. Dude, what are you doing? Can I help you with something? We were looking for- - A Frisbee. We dropped a Frisbee. You have a totally great fire, and we thought we would- This is a great opportunity to maybe mend our friendship. And we could hug, as they say- - Hug it out. - It out. So. Maybe. Oh, great. A hug. Crocket. Drop it. You love me. Perhaps you'd like to join us. How did you do that with one hand? A little help, please. What do you want me to do, man? Hi, BFF. Now is the time to come help your buddy. I still gotta find the Frisbee. Help! I think the Frisbee is over here, bro. Have fun. Are you ready to test the curse? I'm not really. What the hell is this? - Oh! - It's protection? This is not going to stop us. Take your best shot. Let's rock. Oh, there you are. Hey. I've been looking for you. Where have you been? I've been looking for you. I want you to get your sexy butt in my trailer, right now! Enough of the horse thing. I'm ready. I want you. And I want you now. You keep that emotion going. I'm gonna go slip into something more comfortable, put on my nice shoes, and come right back. Just get nice and relaxed. Have a couple sips. And I'll be back. Okay, don't you keep your princess waiting. Roy. Roy, wake up. Roy, what's up, man? Roy is asleep. I need your help with Jeanette. Why didn't you say so in the first place? Roy! What is it? We got a date with Jeanette. Oh! Let's go. Here we go. Come on. Wakey, wakey, time to get nakey. - Wake up, buddy. - Oh, okay. So, you're gonna go in there and pretend you're me. And she's going to ask you to do some really crazy stuff. Oh, kinky. I like it. Just treat her like a princess. That's what she's all about. Got it. And your name is Will. Fetch boy. Brush. Beautiful. Handsome. Intelligent. Brush. Jamón. Brush. Brush every sun-kissed golden follicle. Looking glass. Hello. Sunshine. Haha. Away with it. Damn it. Jeanette is incapable of delivering the performance we need to assure victory. Kate must be my leading lady. For without her, we stand to lose the grand finale. And I refuse to be a peasant next season. Hello. What's going on, Pete? No, no, no. Listen, listen. You press record once so you only TiVo the one episode. You gotta press record twice and you're going to get a season pass and you can TiVo every episode. Yes, that's how it works in the modern age. Do not delete over "Gossip Girl", okay? Do not delete "Gossip Girl." All right, water my ficus. All right. I'ma holler at you, B. All right, peace. Where was I? There is no other option. Kate must be my Juliet. Even if I have to kill to make it happen. Oh, Jamón, really? Maybe not kill, but something killish. - Hey. - Hey. - It's a good looking fire. - Yeah, it's warm. So, where is Benny the dog? He's sleeping. - That's very adorable. - Yeah, he's cute. Are you gonna go to the faire tonight? Isn't it closed? It's very dark outside. No, it's open for fare opening night. It's the moonlight walk. I'm totally down. - Do you wanna do it? - Yeah. All right. Cool. I've never been here at night. - Isn't it gorgeous? - It's cool. It's kind of dark. Yeah. But it's pretty. Hey, bobbing for apples, let's do it. Do you wanna do it? Do you wanna do it? Can you hold on to this by the way? What is that? It's a key to Crockett's chastity belt. Ew. Get it out of my pocket.

All my songs are written by people who have been dead for a long time. That's okay. I'm sure they won't mind. Wow. That's really amazing. That's very impressive. Really? That's definitely what we should do for the grand finale. If you can play that well then I think we should use it. Definitely. So, I just play a song? Yeah. We'll make one up. Oh, like sing-a-song?

Not good with pies. Just good with getting them on my face. You got it all over your face. I learned about, that doing it doesn't always have to mean doing it. No. You do lots of things. - Yeah, so we just did it. - Yeah. We worked that all out. This is you, right? Yes. I had a really good time tonight. Yeah, me too. And we figured out what we're going to do for the grand finale. We can work on it tomorrow. We'll just practice tomorrow. So, tomorrow morning, you wanna meet at the piano? Yeah, that place is totally empty in the morning. So, we'll have use of the piano. Okay, cool. Let's do it tomorrow. Okay. You wanna kiss me now? All right. Cool. Okay, wait. - No you're not. - I know. Okay, one, two, three. Nice. Good lifting. Oh, I hate them. This is amazing. Good teamwork. That was great. Well, fare thee well. Fare well. I'd do it to you, too. Kookookachu. Nice. Yeah. Kookookachu. It was great, insane person. Hi, sweet boy. How are you, Benny? Did you have a good time? Are you well rested? Yes, I had a good time. Oh. Wait, Will. Will? So sorry to see of your tall friend's infidelity. Yeah. I'm sure you are. Can't say I'm surprised though. Under the circumstances perhaps you'll reconsider my previous proposition. Oh, what proposition? For you to play Juliet at the grand finale. What about Jeanette? Looks like she has already found her Romeo. Yeah, I'll do it. You'll do it? Yes, I will do with you. Yes, of course. Why wouldn't you? Get over here. - No. - Don't touch me. I won't. I do not like men like you. I don't either. Leave. I am leaving. Do not lurk. No lurking. I'm walking away. Walking away. Advantage, right. I told you! Respect the stache. Jerk. - Oh, fetch boy. - Just a fetch boy here. Just combing your hair. Pretty princess. Sweet. I made it. I'm home. Are you all right, bro? You? You left me out there for the witches. And they attacked my weenus again and again and again with the belt. Listen to that, it held up. Chastity belt. It worked. Can't beat steel, brother. Yeah. Where are you going? It's early. I gotta meet Kate and finish that song. Grand finale. The finale is today. I've got to, I've gotta find Jo. We gotta win. Jo! I'm really sorry, babe. Jo, I need to tell you something. What? I did something kind of bad. What? Well, last night when I saw Will go into the trailer and I saw everything that happened, and then, you know, Rank showed up. I told him that I would be Juliet with him. With the nobles? I'm really sorry. I'm sorry. I just, I just want to get back at Will so much. He really hurt you, didn't he? I'm really sorry. I don't have to do it. I can just leave. Come on. You've always wanted to play this role. You're going to be a beautiful Juliet. It's fine. Jamon, I'm so excited. Here, grab this for me, won't you? Won't be needing this. Now! Have you delivered Kate's Juliet costume to her tent? Si. Good boy, Jamón, good boy. Now, just in case, I have a plan B. Si! No, Jamón! Plan B. - Si. - B. Can you even say "B"? Si. You're going to be a good boy? How are you feeling, honey? Nervous. Really nervous. Well, you look amazing. Okay. You're gonna be great. Okay. Rank is actually a pretty good actor, you know? That's what I'm told. Hey, Jo! I can't find Kate. You sound surprised. That's because I am surprised, Jo, because I was supposed to meet her to work on our song. Never showed up. She doesn't wanna see you, Will. Why doesn't she wanna see me? Chop the dumb act. Not an act. Kind of dumb. Yeah, you are. We all know about you and Jeanette. Me and Jeanette? Oh, she thought that was me in the... I gotta go. Jeanette! May I be bold enough to say I find you irresistible. You do? Yes! Yeah, sure I do. Let me see those darling digits. Let me see those cute cuticles. Yes. It's in there. Oh, Rank! I didn't know you were so kinky. Oh, yeah. Actually darling, I'm not kinky. I'm a rather conservative lover. But aren't you going to take advantage of me? Darling, I already have. Your Grace, unfortunately, it seems that due to severe intoxication, Jeanette will be unable to attend tonight's performance of the grand finale. Rank! Will! I've taken the liberty of asking Lady Kate to become a noble and perform with me in her stead, with, of course, your royal permission. Well, this is highly irregular. Since I feel partly responsible for my daughter's behavior, I will allow it. Thank you. Doesn't anybody care? Hello! Kate, Jo told me that you're mad at me? I don't wanna talk to you. You think I was with Jeanette? Oh, my God. - Get away. - Why won't you just listen? - Just listen. - Go away. Guards, take away this low-caste filth. All right, fetch boy. Let's go. Yeah, we can go. Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. It is the grand finale. At the end, a champion will be chosen, and new nobles will be crowned. And now, from the Greenbriar camp, Horny and Roy. Oooh. What are we going to do today, Horny? Oh, I got it. Let's tell some jokes. Okay, Horny, but keep them clean. Oh, I know a clean joke. What is it, Horny? How can you tell if you're girlfriend is ticklish? I don't know. How? Give her a test-icle. Rubbish. Get it? Testicle. From Bradford camp, Count Le Petite and General Tso. All right. Here comes the show. Go, get him, CLP. Yes. Le sausage. Le Fast food. Brava. Amazing, my boy! I taught them everything they know. I don't believe it. Well, I'll get you a sandwich if you like. All right. You can stop now. From the Greenville camp, Jo and Crocket. Boring. Dude, that was amazing. Good, right? Dude, we totally kicked ass. Yeah! You're amazing. It was good, right? Dude, you crushed! You were awesome. Chest bump! You're going to leave me hanging on a chest bump? Why is she not chest-bumping? I did not hook up with Jeanette. Tell Kate. Not me. I tried telling Kate and Rank won't let me near her. Well, maybe you should try harder. How am I supposed to try harder? She's pissed. There is a change in the program. Kate will not be performing with the peasants. Here now, Will, the fetch boy. It's you. Go, go, go. No, no. Yes, you have to go. I'm only half the act. Kate's not here. Just go up there and make it up. We need you. What am I supposed to do? Just make up a song. The first thing that comes to your mind. Giraffes. Go! Go, go, go! Today I'm going to play a song for my friend Kate, because I was originally going to do a duet with her, but she got mad at me, and I tried to explain myself but there's some stuff she needs to know and, what better time than on stage in front of a group strangers to have an intimate conversation. So I wrote her a little song. ♪ You make this crazy place seem right ♪ ♪ You make me feel okay to wear tights ♪ ♪ And I wear these tights for you ♪ ♪ You are small and I am tall ♪ ♪ And if they had phones in the renaissance ♪ ♪ I'd give you a call and I would ♪ ♪ Ask you If you want to do it with me ♪ Oh, Lord. ♪ I never did it with Jeanette I swear ♪ ♪ It was Roy and his puppet ♪ ♪ With her in there ♪ ♪ I'm telling you this ♪ ♪ Because I care I just painted her nails ♪ ♪ And brushed her wasted hair ♪ ♪ Her super drunk hair ♪ ♪ Her blacked-out hair ♪ Too much information. ♪ Her shit-faced hair ♪ ♪ I love your smile ♪ ♪ And when you laugh ♪ ♪ You're a koala bear and I'm a giraffe ♪ ♪ And this giraffe ♪ ♪ Wants to do it with you ♪ ♪ Just do it with you ♪ ♪ And only you ♪ ♪ This giraffe ♪ ♪ Wants to do it with you ♪ This song is now called, "This Giraffe Wants to Do it With You." - That was wonderful. - Indeed, your Majesty. What do you think? Where did that come from? It just started flowing. I was just singing what I felt. Do you know you are a champ? That was amazing. Kate, time for stage. Rank, I don't think I can do it anymore. I'm really sorry. I misunderstood some things. Yes, I've prepared for this. I've taken the necessary precautions. That's my dog. Yes. What is wrong with you? Oh, such fire. Such passion. Save it for the stage. - You're crazy. - Am I? Or am I just acting crazy? Don't answer that. Get on the stage to perform or the dog dies. I hate you. I think Rank is up to something. Why is she still with Rank? And now for the Stratford camp, Lady Kate and Sir Rank. She's gonna perform with Rank after I just sang a song telling everybody that I think she's a koala bear? Amazing. Come on. Will, that was wonderful. Thanks, Jo. But, soft. What light. Through yonder window breaks. It is the East. And Juliet is the sun. I can't believe Kate's with him. It's ridiculous. Wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father. And refuse thy name. Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love. And I'll no longer be a Capulet. Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this? 'Tis but thy name that is my enemy, Will. Yes, to Will. So gorgeous. What's Montague? Will? It is not hand, nor foot, nor arm, nor face, nor any other part belonging to a man. O, be some other name, Will. Does that seem weird to you that she keeps saying Will? It's definitely not in the script. By any other word would smell as sweet. So Romeo would, were he not Romeo called. Why does she keep looking at the side stage? Perfection which he owes without that title. Romeo, doff thy name, and for thy name, which is no part of thee. Take all myself. Will! Will. Haha. That doesn't sound like Shakespeare. Something is wrong, man. Something is definitely wrong. Come with me. Were I twill a rose? I am as beautiful. What are you doing? Focus! Never add to Shakespeare. Stick to the script, idiot. I take thee at thy word. They got Benny. Dude, he's forcing her to act with him. That's why she's doing it because they're got Benny at gunpoint. Henceforth, I will never be Romeo. So stumbles the council. I hate you. So stumbles the council. Say the line or the dog gets it. We gotta save him. Dude, just go. Don't be foolish, Bon Ami. Ha! Guys. This is a renaissance faire. It's all make-believe. He's not really from France. And you're not really Asian. - Yes, I am. - Are you really? Come here, I'll choke your ass. I got him. Thank God. Do something! Shoot him, shoot him while he's handing the dog. I don't remember a dog. Behind you. Thank you, my lady. You're gonna have him shoot me with a crossbow? Yes. Da-da-da. Horny to the rescue! Oh, no. Are they still acting? Is this part of the show? Dude, all joking aside, I'm going to kick your ass. Oh, wonderful. Use that energy with swords! Like they did in the age of the renaissance. Haha. I'm not going to play swords with you, buddy. Did you hear that, folks? The big shaved ape is also a big bloody chicken. Okay, I definitely will sword fight you now. En guard. Okay. Now you say en guard. I'm not gonna say en guard. But you just did. Damn it. Lunge. Looks like someone lost their sword. I don't think you're supposed to say the W in sword. I say it. What I say is right. I have the sword. On your knees, fetch boy. Kneel, kneel before me. Romeo still in character. Respect the piece. I'm not gonna kneel near your piece. Fine. Don't have to. Any final words before I kill you, fetch boy? Yeah. You're a very weird guy. That was so cool. You saved me. Thanks for catching me. It's no problem. I thought it was the obvious move. You saved my dog. I did. Where is he? - Benny. - Come here, Benny. Who's a good boy? Fake sword. Fake sword. Real fist. Come on, guys. Guys, you look great. You look good up here in this theater. Come on up here, buddy. Thank you. Well done, everyone. It was splendid. Now, I have made my decision. The Greenbriars shall be next year's nobles. Hip, hip, hooray! Kate and Will, please approach.
