[♪♪♪] [SNORING AND WHIMPERING] [RINGING] [STILL SNORING] [RINGING CONTINUES] Hello? Hello? Will you wake up, you snoring hyenas. I can't hear a thing. [GRUNTS] Stop snoring. Hello? No wonder I can't hear a thing, there's nobody on the line. [RINGING] It's the doorbell. Oh. Get out of my way. Okay. Well, I guess I'll have my morning smoke. Where'd he go? Where's Moe? Where'd Moe go? [YAWNS] [FLICKING SOUND] Ow, ow, ow! Ah, what are you squawking about? [SHOUTS] Hey, it's a telegram from Bill. This explains why he didn't come home last night. "Got married last night, flying home today. "Sorry, must ask you to move. "Ordered TV set delivered today. "Pay men for installing antenna, "repay you later. Regards, Bill." Say, why can't we put up the television antenna ourselves? And we save him the money for the wedding present. Wonderful. Let's clean up the joint. Now, rise and shine. Right-o. Okay. Time to rise and shine. Oh, that's nice of him to send a telegram. Yeah. Oh, yeah. [SHOUTS] Why don't you watch where you're going? Relax. As soon as I eat this jelly sandwich, I'll help you guys. I can't work on an empty stomach. Well, I'm hungry and I haven't... Aw, shut up and finish your job. [MOE SHOUTING] [LOUD CRASHING] [GURGLING] [COUGHS] [SHOUTS] Wait a minute. [SHOUTS] Hey, it's stuck. Help me get it loose. The water must have swelled his head. Oh, he always had a swelled head. [TAPPING] [GRUNTING] Stop doing it for me, you're doing it to me! Oh, my neck. You nitwit. Wh... Say, did you say you were hungry? Oh, I'm starved. How'd you like to have my sandwich? Oh, I'd love it. You got it. Oh! [CHUCKLING] Why? Get another bucket full of water and finish up the mopping or you'll find out why and how. Yes? [LAUGHS] Why, you. Whoa! [SHOUTING] [GROANING] What's the matter with you? What are you playing around for? Oh, but it's that door. Never mind the door, I'll fix it. Go get some water. What a nitwit. I never saw a guy like that. [SHOUTS] [SIGHS] [GROANING] I didn't know you were standing there, Moe. I wouldn't have slammed the door. Oh, you slammed it. Yeah. [CHUCKLES] That's all right, kid. Hey, is that a spot? Where? There. Oh. Now, go on, get busy. I don't want any more trouble with you either. Okay, okay. Well, get to work, I gotta make myself another sandwich. Ah, I hope you choke. [SHEMP SHOUTING] [LOUD CRASHING] [GURGLING] [SPITTING] How do you like that? No more jelly. Guess I'll have to eat cheese. Gotta get some bread. You cockeyed soap. You troublemaker. [HUMMING] I'll get some more water and be right back. [BANGING] Oh... Darn that door again. And this too! A valuable antique. You muttonhead. [LOUD CRASHING] [SHOUTING] Larry! Hold it, kid, I'll get it in a minute. Now, hold it still. There we go. There. There. There. [SHOUTING] There. [HUMMING] Mm-hm. Heavenly. Yummy, yummy. Stop squawking and get busy or I'll dust your brains out again. [SHOUTING] [CRYING] Oh, that cockeyed door again. I'll fix it. Yes, sir. Come on over here. [PHONE RINGS] I'm coming, I'm coming. Hello? Yeah, we're waiting for the television set. You're bringing it right over? Thanks. [CRACKING] [SHOUTS] Hey, Moe. Shemp. Always stalling. Two guys are never around when you want them. [LOUD CRASHING] SHEMP: Ow! [GURGLING] All right. Take it easy now. [GRUNTS] Look at this boy. All right, we'll give you a hand. There you are. Ouch. Ouch, my finger. I nearly ruined the ring my girl won for me in a crackerjack box. I'll take it off for safety. [GRUNTS] It's tight. [POPS] Oh. How do you like that? But that won't stop me. [GRUNTS] Hey, we're short a couple of screws. Go in the kitchen and get some. Okay. [CRACKING] Oh, oh, I twisted my ankle. Hey, this is the control knob off the television set. You stepped on it and bent it. Now, get a hammer and fix it. This thing is still loose. Ah, I got you. I lost the knob. I need a longer arm or a shorter wall. Shorter wall. [BANGING IN BACKGROUND] Come on, kid. No, nothing's gonna help you. Come on. I'll get you. Why...? My beautiful crackerjack ring is in here. Right in he... I got it. No, you haven't, but you're gonna get it. Wait a minute, Moe. That thing cost 100 bucks. So it does. Here's something for free. [SHOUTING] [SPUTTERING] [SHOUTS] What's the matter with you? [GRUNTS] You trying to burn the joint down? Listen, I'm telling you... Moe, I dropped a knob in the wall, I had to get it out. That's no excuse. That's how guys start fires, playing with matches in houses. Now, I'm telling you, one of these days... Hey, I smell smoke. Are you chewing tobacco? No, I... [SNIFFS] You idiot. You did set the joint on fire. Go on, get some water. Hurry up. Hurry up! Hey, Moe, what's cooking? Your goose if you don't shut up and do something. All right, I'll... Oh! Oh, the joint's on fire. Oh, if we only had some marshmallows. Go out and get some marshmallows. What's marshmallows? Come on, get this thing out. All right, let me fan it. Marshmallows. I'll fan it out. Get out of my way when I'm fighting fire, and quit blocking the water. Now I'll have to get some more. [SPUTTERS] It's getting worse. Hey, there's a fire extinguisher in the kitchen. Go get it. Hurry up. All right. Wait'll I find my way. [LARRY GROANS] [WATER SPLASHING] [GURGLING] Wait a minute. Is that me? No, it's me. Well, go on and get that garden hose. Okay. Go on. Give me that thing. Look out. Well. Okay. [GROANS] [SHOUTS] [SPITTING] It's dry. Keep pumping. Give me that hose. No. Give me that hose! No. Let go, will you? LARRY: Will you let go of it? I know how to work it. Hey! The fire's in there. Okay. [FLAMES BEING EXTINGUISHED] That did it, Larry. That did it. Oh, no, it didn't. But this did. Oh, oh, oh! Wait a minute. Go shut the water off and hook this antenna up on the roof. Hurry up. Now, come on. Get out of here. And you get that control knob out of the wall while I put the television set back together again. All right. [GROANS] Yeah. [GRUNTS] [SHOUTS] Just for that, you don't go in there. [BARKS] Now we'll get it. Hm, champagne glass. Well. Oh, there it is. [CHUCKLES] There. Good as new. Hey, Moe. Moe, I got it. I found the knob. Good work, kid, but... [SHOUTS] A Swiss cheese. Look what you did to the wall. How are you gonna explain that to Bill? Woodpeckers. [BOTH CHUCKLING] That's a good one, ain't it? Yeah. Here's a better one. Yeah? What happens now? This: Oof! Now, go on, get those boards up there. I gotta get that plug back, so we can plug the television set in. Hm. [HUMMING] I'll have this television set together in no time. [POPPING AND CRACKLING] Nyah. [SHOUTING] Oh... Larry...? Wait a minute, Moe, I'll put it out. [WHIMPERING] Wait a minute, Moe, I got an idea. Don't go away. [MOE WHIMPERING] [BIRDS SINGING] Come on, Shemp. Hurry up! [GRUNTS] Well, this cockeyed thing won't work here. I better nail it to the roof. By golly. Don't move around there. [CRASHING] [GRUNTS] You imbecile, leave that alone and come down here! I'm coming. Whoa... How do you like that guy, huh? [LOUD CRASHING] I fall down. [SIGHS] Well, Rosebud, here we are, our little love nest. Yes. In we go. But, Bill, darling, a bride never crosses her threshold by herself. You're right, little dumpling. [SPITS] [SIGHS] Oh. [LAUGHING] Oh, I'm so happy. This is so wonderful. [GASPING] Why, I wouldn't live in this rat's nest. [GRUNTS] But, baby... Ah, let her go, Bill. Sure, Bill. Then the four of us can live in peace and harmony. Why, you home wreckers. I'm... I'm gonna... Why, you... Wait a minute. Whoa! Whoa! Don't shoot. Don't shoot, Bill. Bill, don't shoot. Whoa, whoa, whoa. I got you. [GUNSHOTS] [IN UNISON] Oh, oh, oh. Ow, ow, ow. [ALL MOANING] [♪♪♪]
