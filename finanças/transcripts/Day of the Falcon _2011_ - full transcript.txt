We can not make war with thee . Your son will join us in peace. I will exalt him as a father, with my son Tarik and daughter Leyla. Corridor And Yellow? We should laugh at ourselves for we be held this... This piece of sand. Whether a no man's land between us. No one will claim. God is my witness, I agree. God is our witness. Saleh never forget that you are my eldest son. You inherit my throne. Defend the honor of our house. Auda! Crying is wasting water. Do not worry, sidi, the time pass quickly. You could swear that he won. May all our enemies like him, Colonel. It is my sad duty to announce your mother Princess Zamira, died. What hand? Leyla! Auda! You are there! What are you doing? Leyla said that our mothers are in heaven and they watch over us. Leyla! Princess you're too big to play with boys. Go back. Leyla, darling... Come. They need water. But they have a well! Cholera has taken up residence there. This happens there in Paris? My wife would she died in Paris? No, Your Majesty. This happens to it in London? The last epidemic of cholera in London must date back one hundred years. Here we are? Hundred years behind the West? Rather miles, Your Majesty. Tarik, my son, there worst curse of being a poor king? I can not grow anything. I can not ship. Not even to trade. Who would come to Hobeika? The truth be Arab means being a servant at the banquet of the world. This is called House of Allah. The emptiness of sight. And this road? This is the North Road. To the south, there Hobeika. And due north Salmaah. My beautiful! Pleated eyes Why you? Hoping that one day on a clear day, I perceive Salmaah. It's too far. It's strange, Saleh. What? I'm starting to forget what father looks like. At that. It looks like this. Stay away! Back! Not so close. Stand back, please. - And hospitality? - At the infidels? That's for me to decide. Take him. I'm sorry, gentlemen. I Nesib, Sultan Hobeika. Thurkettle Sat, Your Majesty. You are an artist, Mr. Thurkettle? No, sir. I work for a small company named Texan Oil. There is no oil here, Mr. Thurkettle. Nothing but sand, sun and wind. Half of the year, it blows from the east. It's winter. The other half, it blows from the south. It's summer. I must contradict you. It... This is the black shale. There is no lack, here. It usually indicates the presence of oil. Feel it, Your Majesty. Go! It smells like what? Oil. The shale behaves like a sponge. And this is not any oil. Come back to it, Your Majesty. Is it a pungent or sweet? Douce. Exactly! From sweet light crude, the best in the world. I would bet my last dollar you have one package. You'll be rich. Rich? Pretty damn rich. When you say "damn rich", how rich it is? Your Majesty, a good well product one hundred thousand barrels per day, a dollar a barrel. 365 days a year. More Money Than the King of England? The King of England, it has what? Green lawns and a wet hat. Tarik, who is it, Lindbergh? A guy from Texas. He said he found oil. True? Where exactly did you get that? Gianni, what's it called again? Corridor Yellow, Your Majesty. The Yellow Corridor. A blind man on his knees before God is happier seeing a lot of greed. The latter, like the Franks wants to quench his thirst with sand. - "... With sand." - What does he say? What they say when the mail is monitored. But you recommended, my lazy friend , to do some exercise. Stop! It's expensive, a book! Shake your booty! Give it to me. Go, little brother! But moving! You are a slow agonizing. - What is beautiful! - Superb! Ibn Idris... Princess, we thought you intended. - Who said that? - Everyone. This is what we'll see. In my arms, my friend! I adore you! God be with you, Colonel. When you negotiate with Amar, made him the offer. - But only as a last resort. - Of course. Please let me go. On my honor, I will return. My father would force me. But I need you here. Why? For falconry? Have patience. You will see again soon Salmaah. Do not come back once the agreement. Colonel... wait! Tell my father that I'm exercising... I will not fail. The name of Allah, the Merciful... Next! Mr. Minister. - And the scissors? - Lost, Emir. Thank you, father. Auda! To you the honor. Go. Here... Auda, I know much you love the books. Do not you? I officially appoint you Librarian of the Kingdom. Approach. He's happy? Yes! Well, well. And here is your office. Go! Sit there. Gentlemen, please... That's how we ended the day in the South, with a good old bourbon. - Cheers! - The best liquid in the world. It is rich. For the lucky biggest desert! Take up this stuff, fast! They have weighted the feet and threw them in the tank for literally they are full of oil. Are suspected Al Talabyns or Anizas. I do not reign over a country. I reign on a mosaic tribes, people... Deeply conservative. They do not like oil? They are in ever using that for their camels , in poultices, against scabies. But... I'll beat the drum and "see" while their sliding gold in the pocket. I will act so that your people are protected. Maybe would it take to launch the operation Corridor Yellow. I should wait next cholera epidemic? The next woman died in childbirth, like mine? Our people need the oil money now! The envoys are back. We return to Hobeika. Auda, the delegation! She came back. We will return. Finally, I hope. Look. Quick! They look exhausted. Provided they have succeeded! What did he say? He repeated week after week: "I gave my word and my son to this treaty " passed under the eyes of God. "Why withdraw?" You did say it That oil wealth is a gift from Allah? It seemed the opposite view. The Sultan would like to point considers that the operation of the Corridor as a violation of the Treaty. If Amar wants war, he will! I'll join father. Not a word. Declare war. These lands are ours! Let's go, gentlemen. Encore! We just got back. No laziness! This is the hunting season. It only negotiate. Offer him more. I already tried, Mr. Thurkettle, but said that money has no value. Never heard of it. You offered to return her son? Of course, following your instructions. My dear boy, come over here. We live in difficult times, but we will find a solution. Where is your brother? I think it was a little disappointed. So he went out to... Get some air. My beautiful... Fly away! How beautiful! Please, no! Auda was necessarily aware. It is an accomplice to this heinous crime. You've always been a brother to me, anyway. It is said that every man has three tasks to accomplish in this world. Plant a palm tree, dig a well and beget a son. Have you ever done one of them? I'll allow, with the blessing of Allah, Start with the easiest of the three. Instead of judging the remaining hostage, Auda, brother of the infamous murderer Saleh Nesib, king of Hobeika supreme commander of the southern tribes , a gesture of extraordinary clemency saw fit to adopt Auda within his own family and offer him by the sacred bonds of marriage his daughter, Princess Leyla. Sign here. Sign! I declare the previous treaty between the house of Amar and the house of Nesib null and void. Let us recite Al Fatiha. Go! It is here! Here is a token of my gratitude. They come from a place called... Switzerland! - Dear Friend! - King Nesib... All Beni Sirris are proud to be at your side. They are welcome in my house. For you. I have exactly the same. Now we are brothers. Do not forget. Brothers! It's been how long? 11 years. Do you remember! You were so surprising, as a boy out of a book. Do you see what I look like today? You have the right to take off my veil. I made do a Bedouin costume for you. Do not you like it? I never thought you... Would become so beautiful. Princess, do not you see that it's a trap? A trap? How so? If your father wants get married, is to destroy my hostage status and make war with mine. It was not a marriage, but a declaration of war. I could have gone to Salmaah. I should have gone Nesib as envoy. Who better than I could talk to my dad? Why no one thought? Because nobody sees me. And if we marry, we can no longer negotiate. Do we not already married? Strictly speaking, not yet. All this is only vulgar politics. So, all these years to spy on you through the moucharabiehs when you came home from the library, with books, Look so wise and so serious... It was the policy? You were promised to Ibn Idris. I was promised to no man. I went to see my father and I chose you, you. I? Saleh Why not? For you, it's a good brother. For me, it's just a prince with a hawk and love of the past. Come see. My mother looked out the window and did she see? An unchanging world. But you, you are intelligent and sensitive. Do not worry, Prince Auda. Look you're in the harem. This is the only place on earth where we have the right to unveil. Alikoum Salam Ibn Idris. Alikoum salam. So you have exhausted all your balls ? Nesib living wills. He promised to pay blood money. Let simple. The guards you killed my cousins ​​were . You can not shoot me, Ibn Idris. I am a prince. You were a prince. Saleh died. What? It would never have left. Never. Hello, Father. The apple of my eye! Are you? If I'm fine? Why did you not with your husband? Te has he dishonored? Would it not... The purpose of a wedding night? None. It is the gentlest of men. Can I ask you a question? Saleh is dead? Father, hold. You I never asked a favor? All the time. Sometimes I tell myself that God put me on earth just for that. What do you want? I thought. We thought. What a blessing for us to have under our roof the son of two fathers. Should I not myself peace-loving father, send this son father who seems to blinded by the war? To remind the pious man in the Holy Quran the word "peace" returns twice that the word "war"? You are the emissary of Hobeika but above all... You are my son and married to Leyla. I have not finished yet! Tell Amar I do not seek conflict, but I did not shirk. And this time... They are with me. Go, now. My daughter request permission to accompany her husband to the door. It is never mounted in an automobile. Do you remember these places? Not really. Monsignor... Your son is here. Saleh? In fact, it was Auda... father. Peace be with you. Auda, of course. Forgive me, too many years have passed. Fifteen. That much? You became a man. Thank God. Where is Saleh? It is no longer with us. Why? Where is he? He entered the grace of Allah. He killed his guard and was shot. He killed his guard? He ​​fled to the return of the delegation. And not you, obviously. I come here as an emissary. The emissary who? Envoy of peace, I hope. Nesib With soldiers? In a car infidels? Amir, it was faster. And his advisers speak in your place. Your houses are now united. Auda? I married Leyla. You married the daughter of Nesib for being murdered your brother? Let me explain. You explain to. Do not doubt it. But these people return to Hobeika. My sense of hospitality does not extend murderers of my son. Forgive me, Princess. It's nothing. Latifa something that speaks of love. Do you think we would have killed you if you had refused the marriage? Some might suggest to Nesib that I would leave remove a freer hand. Then, according to the principle of Al Takeyya, which permits a Muslim to hide if he thinks his life is threatened, you are absolved. You must free a slave, or, if you can not do, fast three days and say three times: "I divorce you, Leyla , daughter of Nesib" and you will be issued. Thanks for the advice. You say come as an emissary of peace. The term is a misnomer. Indeed. For it is we who are abused, while we remained peaceful. army was ready. Tribes Vengeance shouting, but I waited. Why? To keep his word. Corridor belongs to no one. But now you are free to act. This war is the cause of God! Can I speak? Listen my son! My father always recommended to read the Koran . I am surprised that people of faith gathered here any call to war while the holy book condemns the . Sura 2, Emir enjoins us to defend ourselves against the infidels. It allows you to defend yourself against the unbelievers who want your loss. Precisely, these foreigners want our loss. How? Were you threatened? Unbelievers may be a threat to Muslims. For Muslims! "Be not a friend " to anyone who is not your people. " Oil is unholy because it links us to the infidels. You totally reject? It operates vehicles unbelievers. What are our vehicles? - Camels. - of course! We have camels! I have a question. If oil is not for us, why Allah did it take us? If wanted us to serve, Quran would say. The Qur'an would say! He has not forbidden in the Koran. I think he put in the ground to improve our lives. What counts, that's life eternal. We do not have to improve life on earth. This is a temporary enjoyment. A temporary enjoyment! And your glasses, it is a sin? They improve your life. No, Emir. They allow me to see the words the Holy Qur'an more clearly. Listen to me! The enemy are apostates. Do you hear? Hello. You are alone. Unfortunately, yes. I'm sorry. The king kept his son Amar. Auda remained for further discussion. Ibn Idris , can I count on your support? Do you remember how you taught me to pray? I was not higher than your sword. Tell me. Was I wrong to come here? The fate made my profession of war, Sidi. But in truth, I have never seen anyone win. Enter. Good evening, Doctor. I'm very badly. Tell me about your symptoms it a little less vague. I have a high fever, my heart beats a hundred miles an hour and it looks like my head will explode. Replace your sleeve. I know what you have. A cigarette? You make an attack of hypochondria. Not at all. , if it is in the head, but do a little exercise. I really really bad. Somatization. Your mind is agitated. If you are calm, you are better. And this is so, Modern medicine is prohibited here. The drugs are banned? Why? Why? It's coming from abroad. This is the work of the devil. This is the venerable theologians say Sultan. You've seen them, I think. They just forgot that the Prophet himself said: "Use medicine. " Allah has created no disease without provide the remedy. " Unless old age . The Sultan has swallowed the Koran at once. At his age, is digested poorly. Good luck to you. Wait, doctor. What is your name? Ali. Ibn Ali Amar. The unloved son of the Sultan. And his favorite scapegoat. We are brothers? The disease has not affected your judgment. Yes, different mothers. Mine was more beautiful. Our father would say he did more than you, Saleh died , ascended into heaven, among the virgins. I do not count. All you will return. Do not slam it. Why you do not count? Because I have opinions. This is frowned upon in Salmaah. We must obey blindly. Beware of our father, the only leader who prefers to be poor. It has a strange seduction. You have spoken well, yesterday. I have lost the habit to hear the voice of youth. I've dropped too soon, you and Saleh . Come. Father, I must know. Nesib offered you send us. Why did you refuse? I'll tell you. Accountants Nesib offered me 5% revenue Corridor. I refused. On reaching 32%, they suggested... Already how... Include you in the lot. Only... When I got defeated, 15 years ago by telling your mother I'd have let you hostage, it was like a bird who no longer wants to sing. She retired to her room, turned to the wall... She died six weeks. Your life was priceless for her. Not for me. He assigned a value would dishonor his memory. Know, my son, that everything you see in this room was conquered by blood or by love. Not by money. What can be purchased has no real value. I came to warn you. Nesib has a powerful army, on the North Road, with modern weapons. His fortune swells visibly and he rallied the southern tribes. Poor , he had money for guns . The one who believes only weapons is a poor soldier. As for the southern tribes, they are quicker to celebrate a wedding to choose sides in the war. By the way, I was... This when you were young. Do you remember? I told you I saw the inside of your soul. Tell me the truth. Want to repudiate the marriage? None. I like it. Really. You know, my son, the greatest gift in the life of a man, is love. Hassan! Yes, Emir. Go to Hobeika. Nesib Tell my son has softened my heart. To celebrate the union of our houses, I propose to meet in peace at new moon. Father, yesterday, the doctor said... This is a bitter man, a buffoon. He said my brother. All rivers have their tributaries. Given the recent union between your two houses , King Amar forgive you of your right to be unduly Yellow Corridor. That's it? He wants to return to the original agreement passed before God, Corridor stating that belongs neither to him nor you. You finished? No, His Majesty added when the infidels have packed up, she will be happy to attend wedding festivities Which inadvertently you neglected to invite him. Okay. I've beaten, Hassan Dakhil, you and your master. I should have ended. Thank you, Your Majesty. Hassan Dakhil... Sit down a moment. You are a professional. You know that this war to summarize in three words to the house of Amar. Absurd. Cruel. And vain. So... You will build a wall midst of your land. In return, I give a sheep each. They came to see me too, these Texans. With their boots, their hats and their voices thundering . They spoke only of money. But I told them: "What can I make money? " I have been blessed a thousand times. " " My beloved wife, "As you have understood, "father is fully committed to peace. "This is the truest of men. " I look forward to introduce you. " We should live half the year Salmaah " and the other Hobeika. " Where is Hassan? It remains to Hobeika. For an indefinite period. "for health reasons." He bought it. Nesib bought Hassan and killed Saleh. The truth and courage were the stars that guided us. Today oil and money is king. Who are these men, father? I aerate my prisons. It is their year. They, they'll get some exercise? Yes, this is my army of straw. Nesib It will distract while I will hit the heart. You know him well. What does he think of me? Whether you are honorable, but incorrigibly nostalgic . antiquity! If he reported that I conduct my army in the desert to get through the House of God would believe it? Send these men in the House of God? They would die. Better to die for a noble cause The believe-it? Yes. He would think an attack Yellow Corridor. An idea worthy of antiquity! withdraw its men from the North Road to strengthen the Corridor? Yes... probably. Exactly. And then I began the Northern Sea Route to take Hobeika. But you can not if you are in the desert in the House of God. None. But you, though. I what? You'll pass through the House of God. Not the cross, show you but to bring the army of Nesib. I was going to send Hassan, you will take his place. This is absurd. I came to plead for peace, not replace your General. You have it in my blood, you are born to command. You are the future of Sultan Citadel Salmaah, twelfth of the line. reign over these lands for centuries. Our ancestors were escorting the Prophet. Once, I used a firearm. I almost lost my shoulder. I read books. They tell me that my blood is water, protein and iron. And if it contains something else, is the certainty you will lose this war as the previous . I had you mistaken for another. Thank you for coming to Salmaah. You have found a better king and a better father in Nesib. We are at war, being found opulence of Hobeika and the arms of your wife. May God guide your steps. Do you fill the belly! This is the last well. The last water point for two weeks to come. Do you fill the belly. Fill the bottles. Peace be with you, brother. And leprosy with you. You were supposed to rest. What are you doing? You compresses? Not enough. But I've found a replacement in case of relapse . No one will see the difference. So, what's the plan, General? I can not tell you if you do 're not. How could I be if I do not know him? Dr. Ali! Sultan awaits you after the prayer. What a pleasure to see your highness! Or should I say "father"? You turn everything into ridicule. It's easier. - Easier? - What to say what you feel. And what do you feel? I regret not being able as you want. Sit. I thought. If God disapproved of medicine, He ​​would not put people like you on earth. So, perhaps, to your return, we will see your project. Thank you, father. I can count on you? Course. Watch over Auda. I expected to hate him. But no. It reminds me of a young owl. He ​​just sees despite his myopic eyes. This fabric door sweat and blood of our house. The head of our family wears since the time of the Prophet. In Be-worthy. I will do my best. Remember, 'm just identify yourself by Force Nesib. Useless... FOR contact. I know. No need to worry about that. Come. May God protect us all. Can we go that far? Our trucks allow us to strike anywhere. Anyway, it does not really cross the House of Allah. Not with a conventional army. The thing is impossible. I know this region. It would break the bravest. Walk to the House of Allah does not mean the cross. It has not rained here since the sky mourned the death of the Prophet. This is the Door of demons, Emir the entrance to the house of Allah. "Father, is a plane flew over us. " It did not necessarily seen. We continue. " Hey you... Move! Loans to fire! - Ready! - Amir, stay there. We want water ! Back! Stay away! Do not shoot! Move back! We want water! This is not an extravagant claim . Qu ' Is what it is? Silence! I know what it is. Armored. I'll talk to them. Do not do it, Emir. Come back! I am Prince Auda. It's me, Auda. On the dunes, fast! It will be safe, follow me. Jump on the slope! sand in deadly! It jammed. Aim tires! Block the wheels with your clothes. With anything! What you can. Victory! We got them. They were repulsed, Emir. I do not believe. They did not let go. They return to Hobeika. They will kill our Sultan on the North Road. Do you want water? My commander, look there. Was your prince. We want to sell it. We do not ask much. A little water. You have not abused? Your little prince? Why would it be? Come! That's enough. The gas can! Quick, the can! Hurry. We crossed the Rubicon. Another ! There's always something wrong. Give! They are close! It's coming. Here we go! My Beagle! Auda, home to yourself. Amir, fast! Get down. No message? God bless our dead heroes. Everyone in the saddle! Help Us! Help! Now! The sea .. Go to the sea Do not exhaust. You'll find water... In the sea! It is in the sea Yes, of course... It's okay. I grew up with him. I am married to her sister. I'm sorry, Ameer. It was God's will. God hates what is to each other in His name. It is from here. Nesib will embark on our heels. He's right. It will send its planes. That's the war? What inspired epics? Yes. What is really scary, it is how you're good at it. Send the army in the Corridor. Finally, what is left. Is this really wise? I sent my armor, my best plane with my son on board. No one has returned. What do you want more? Prefer pick Amar yourself? Come! How do you know? My spies saw him leave Salmaah He chose his camp, that of the murderer of your brother. You killed Saleh. I have not killed Saleh. He died, that's all. This junk of Auda has betrayed you as he betrayed me. A Amar Amar remains one. Explain to him what the Koran says. The Qur'an says many things on many subjects. On divorce, idiot! Allah does not favor. Except when the husband is beneath all, if he fled and joined a foreign army to march against his family. So... So... the wife... Can break marriage if repeats three times "I divorce..." "On Auda, son of Amar!" Approach. Now say three times: "Me, Leyla, " Nesib daughter, "I divorce Auda, son of Amar." Say it. I refuse. You refuse? If Auda followed his father, is that he had no choice. This is the man most peaceful imaginable. Pacific? Yes. It is just like his father. It is worse, actually. Amar's just stark raving mad! Okay. Disobey me. What's the divorce of a corpse? A corpse? "Hardened criminals", my father said. "Dangerous men." He was right. You are dangerous. But this battle is not yours. You can leave. And the water? We share what is left. You go where? Eastward. The sea Nobody will get us there. I come with you. We also . If this is the house of God, it must be exit. I am sure that the camel was right. Can be found in the water near the sea Who will give us? Fishermen. Merchants. There are always people near the sea A drop. The sea! Look! The sea! Do not drink this water. Do not drink.

See what you find. Donne. From sea water! Nothing emir. Standing, everyone! We're going. You know, go to the sea, it was a choice between certain death and probable death . And the probable death became certain. Well, Your Majesty, very soon, our tongues will swell, our behavior will become very strange and... And then we fall asleep. I wish I could die without this strange noise. He said... The camel said: "Water is in the sea...". No near the sea In the sea! This is a source. A submarine spring! She like? Salee.
