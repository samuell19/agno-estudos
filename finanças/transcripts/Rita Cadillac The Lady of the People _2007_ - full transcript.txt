- I'm not saying anything. - My baby. Is that it? I got in at ten o'clock. - Gee. - Out, out, out. What are you doing? Done. Beans, rice, kale, meat. - I don't want kale. - Just a little kale. RITA'S GRANDDAUGHTER Just a little bit. Just a little, okay? Pity it wasn't very hot. Spray Spray perfume An interview with Rita, doing her nails... you with her and... ...I'm gonna ask some questions. - Okay. - When is this interview? - Wednesday, 3 P.M. 3:30 P.M. We begin. - How are you feeling? - Nervous. - Today is the first day. - It is? DIRECTOR Yeah. We made an interview... ...with your son. - Oh, yeah? Let's come in, guys. Come closer Just a little bit closer A little more closer I want to kiss you Come closer Just a little bit closer A little more closer, love I want to love you "RITA, THE LADY OF THE PEOPLE" I want you To keep me warm this winter And everything else Can go to hell Your kiss smells of orange blossoms My chest brings The sun that shines Your fire, your flame, The love that catches fire My body has the dark color of chocolate The leaf of the race The passion that poisons Two people gave me the Rita Cadillac name. One was Franco, a friend of mine who owned a club in Rio. When I began work for Chacrinha, I was just Rita. Then they told him my nickname was Rita Cadillac. She looked like a Cadillac. But why? CHACRINHA'S SON It was the hot car of those days, get it? It was the fashionable car, the it car. That Cadillac fish tail... and she had a beautiful body, a very beautiful butt... very full, like she has to this day. Her mark... Her trademark was her butt. And the first time he said, A sound for Rita Cadillac"... the idiot here thought it was another Rita... and I just stood still. The third time realized it was me. So I danced and I was baptized as Rita Cadillac... and from then on there's ever been another Rita. A samba for Rita Cadillac. Fly, little canary, fly Show to the people That you are king Half of Chacrinha's success at the time... was because of the chacretes, the dancers. It was a show with 20 women dancing... My father always knew who to show off. He gave her more attention, showed her off more... because he took advantage of that. So I had to do something different. So I decided was the hottie of the show. I was the power girl. I created the character like that. "Okay, maestro, a panther or Rita Cadillac." And the maestro played the Pink Panther theme. There were lots of famous chacretes, but Rita... was the one that really remained. During all the years she was with us... it was over ten, twelve years dancing with us. There was the call for commercials. They all swung their arms, very big and wide. And I decided... I didn't want to do the same thing. So I just twirled my finger to excite people's imagination. To be a chacrete, you have to dance well, to photograph well... you have to be nice, and you have to look good. So I imagine the kind of woman the people at home like. FORMER CHACRETE The teenage girls looked at us... like we were fulfilling their dreams. Right? Because in the early Eighties... being a chacrete was the best thing. It was a time of glamour. Lots of glamour. I think we had a lot of glamour. There was a lot of luxury. - Lots of sparkle. - It was a very beautiful thing. - But... - It played with their imagination. We weren't all that people imagined we were. - Sure, we were a little daring. - While people... were using thongs to the beach, we were using thongs during shows. And there were other girls in other shows. They did their shows in bathing suits. You see? So there was this image of us... "Gee, they'll do anything." Nobody was a prude, a saint, none of that. But we weren't what we were famous for. Who wants some? Who wants some? Chacrinha always made fun of the censorship. The symbol of the censors for us was Solange. Doctor Solange. I called her auntie. Before we went on, they wanted to see... our bathing suits. The problem was some of them used more revealing suits. They'd pull it up more, see? They'd show a little more skin. I was always very naughty. I wore a size 40, 42. But I said I was a 38. I always did that. Just to show off my butt. I want to wake up at dawn RITA WAS CHACRETE FROM 74 TO 83 On the sidewalk So I won't see your good-bye Your good-bye A hand for Rita Cadillac. I want to see the head rest in place ASSUNÇÃO SCHOOL - SANTA TERESA - RJ I was born. My father never knew me. He died when I was 13 days old. Then my mother showed up at my grandmother's house... with me in her arms saying I was her son's daughter. RITA WAS BORN ON JUNE 13, 1954 She lived for a while with my grandma and my brother. One day, my mom left, took me with her. And I left. RITA'S GRANDMOTHER My grandma missed me a lot... I was all that was left of her son. And she went to get me while I was still a baby... and I went back... to her and never saw my mom again. RITA'S MOTHER The image I have of my father comes from my grandmother. Constructed. She said he was a man of character... an honest man, a war hero. CARLOS D'EÇA - RITA'S FATHER RITA WAS 13 DAYS OLD WHEN HER FATHER DIED I created the image of the perfect father. Sure, he had his flaws. The biggest one was not marrying my mother... not giving me his name. My grandmother said I had his eyes. Kind of sad, kind of pulled down. But they were very expressive. Here is the Assunção School. Where I studied. A nun's school. It was a prison for me. It was a boarding school. The nuns were very strict, there was a lot of discipline. Wake up at five in the morning, having cold showers. It was awful. Having to pray all the time. It's terrible. Having to eat what you don't like was terrible. And the abandonment too, because Mother's Day, there's no mother. The Father's Day party, there's no father to come. This is what I had. I couldn't see from here on down. I couldn't see the rest. This was all I saw. I saw the sea in the distance, the Sugar Loaf. But that's the only view I had. This was my prison. GRAVE OF RITA'S FATHER - CAJU CEMITERY - RJ She came from Alagoas state. Through a theater company, running away. She came to Rio, became a seamstress. My grandmother was a very happy woman. She sang all day. She drank a lot. It was a bottle of whiskey every day. She carried me to games, she played all night. She went to play at friends' houses. And she took me with her. And despite that, she educated me... a very strict education, very formal. I didn't even know what sex was. During the dictatorship, she was arrested, and I only found out... several years later. She hid a lot of people in our house, because she'd say: "You can't tell anyone... there's someone here at home." And I kept quiet. And we lived in front of an army barracks. DOWNTOWN - RJ Here was the barracks, they closed this street. It was in the Seventies, right. Imagine, because of the repression and all. Because of the repression. So everything here was closed. There wasn't all this noise, this movement? Not, not at all. There weren't all these cars and buses. And where did you live? Show me. I lived here. Lucy building. 49, Evaristo da Veiga, 503. What memories this place brings you? Good things. This is where I grew up... my childhood was here, this is where I... had a home. The walls are the same. The door is the same. But I lived here. Look. - Your apartment was in the back? - In the back. This was a small room. - Were you naughty? - Very much. I'd run up the stairs, ring other people's doorbells... tried to play with my dolls in the hall, on the stairs. Hi, Rita, how are you? Everything's fine? Pleasure to meet you. They're doing a documentary for our TV channel and for her movie. Yeah? That's great. Wow, the story of a life. It's the spotlight. Hey, there, honey? Let's go clubbing? I'm ready to dance. Hey there. I think I want the mother-in-law. - Paola. - Hi, Paola, how are you? - Nice to meet you. - How are you? The pleasure is mine. I'm talking to Marcião, but I don't know. You think I'm over the hill? Not at all, lady. I think you're all good. Are you taking me out to dance or not? You want to see what's good for you? Or are you going to stay there until you grow leaves? - Roots. - Roots. Or are you going to stay there until you grow roots? - Are we going or not? - Let's go. I don't now how to imitate a horse. Let's go? Me, you, both of us We have a past, my love A guitar put away That flower And many other things "ASA BRANCA" - 1981 DIRECTED BY DJALMA BATISTA It was a film about a popular soccer player. I didn't want a famous actor for the lead. Edson Celulari was launched in the film... he was totally unknown. So there would be no conflict with the audience. I wanted a pure character. And I called the TV stars. Eva Wilma, Walmor Chagas, Gianfrancesco Guarnieri... Geraldo Del Rey. FILMMAKER But there was something missing and that was the rule breaking... character, the wife of the team owner... from the capital. I had done a lot of research. And it happened to be her. I was watching TV and I thought: "This girl can do this," and I called her for an audition. She arrived after lunch. It was a cold day... but she wore a T-shirt, tennis shoes... Tennis really... Pants like this... Very shy, her hair tied together. She came, people looked at her and they were disappointed. Everyone expected a monument, a Cadillac. They expected the Cadillac. It was disappointing. Except for me. "Let's do a screen test. You just do... what you always do for Chacrinha. Just move so we can see how you move." And I coached her. Everybody came to watch, their jaws dropped. Here was the myth she had become... the sex symbol she'd become spontaneously. Where were you? Edson was 22, very young... was very excited about doing... a sex scene with Rita. She sat on the bed, observing. She looked him over, measuring him. She's very perceptive. One of her qualities... is knowing to sense her surroundings. Know where she is, how to act, and she looked at him... measured him up. And I watched them both. When they had to take off their clothes... I asked the crew to leave to create... some intimacy between them. Edson couldn't stop talking and tried to be playful... and he made some rude jokes. She sent him a message that I can't tell you... because it's a secret between her and me, but it shut him up for good. To always sing out of tune Sing out of tune, sing After all that theory... how about a little practice? Me, you, João Turning on the record player On and on I took Rita to the Gramado and Brasília festivals. She caused a great scandal, but she always behaved like a lady. She is a lady. A lady of the people. I always said that to her. She became a sex symbol in Brazil. And she maintained that... after so many decades. She is still there after AIDS, After globalization. I think she's a Brazilian myth. I played soccer on the beach and I had a girlfriend. RITA'S FIRST BOYFRIEND I was like 15 years old. And a cousin of hers came with Rita to Copacabana. I must have been 15 years old. Fifteen. What happened? The thing is I fell for him. I think he fell for me, too... and that was the romance that was my big first love. To this day he's a great love of mine. When Rita came to the beach she was... She was kind of... I remember... this red bikini. In those days, it was... Who is this woman? Not woman. Who is this girl? Where did she come from? She's got it all. Really, this amazing body. A body with no defects, no defects. Truly, a perfect body, on the beach. Once it almost happened. We'd make out a lot. In those days, we'd make out a lot. But nothing happened, because I was afraid. My grandmother always said, women... who give up their virtue cheapened themselves. - So you were a virgin, then? - I was a virgin. Virgin, saint, chaste, pure. And he also respected me a lot. But there came a day when the respect didn't hold up. The love was too great, the heat was too great... the fire really came. They were going to start things when I walked into the room. - We were almost naked. - Rita was... very angry at me, she called me names, argued with me. MÁRIO'S SISTER And I said, "Not here. Out." Vera walked in. She had her shirt off, was almost doing it... when I walked in. - And Rita? - Poor Rita. "Now you come in?" "What did you want? The door was closed, you didn't want me to come in?" It was a cold shower. It was a cold shower. And she managed to put an end to it... because I never wanted to do it with him again. It was hard to land a girl like that. She was amazing. Man, we got these awful women at TV Rio. Roberto Carlos would go in, we went to the beach. Man, to land a girl like that. When Mário and I broke up, I heard he was dating... Sandra, who was part of the gang, too. I decided I was going to provoke him. I said, "I'm going to provoke that man." Maybe if I show up with a boyfriend... he'll think, hey, wait a minute. She's the one I like... she's the one I want. I thought that. RITA'S FIRST HUSBAND Then I met Cezar in October. She met Cezar and decided to marry because of him. I married out of anger. I wanted to quit on my wedding day. I left the church, went to my bridesmaid's house... RITA'S MARRIAGE JANUARY 11, 1971 that was across the street from the church. I went to the room to see the presents and Mário came. And I took him in my arms. And I responded with great pleasure. It was really a kiss and I got worried. I wasn't alone at the party. If I didn't go... she said she'd go to my house. I did that in my wedding dress. It's a scene, a scene I can't forget. And he didn't say anything. Cezar was a salesman I met. One week of honeymoon and I didn't do it. He wanted to and I said no. But you're married now. No. I didn't want to have sex, I didn't want to consummate the marriage. After we came from the honeymoon... he got me drunk. I don't remember anything that happened... and a month later I found out I was pregnant. CARLOS CEZAR BIRTH - OCTOBER 16, 1971 After three months of pregnancy, I caught my husband... with a bridesmaid from his wedding. At her house. She was even married. He really wasn't a man. He wasn't a man of character. He wasn't the man my grandmother thought he was. In the end, it looks like the guy was after... her grandma's money. It's what I... I never told Rita that... but I was sure of it. RITA, HER GRANDMOTHER AND HER SON CARLOS CEZAR My grandmother found out she had lung cancer... and was admitted to the hospital. She died soon after. And I saw myself adrift, with nothing, because... I still had her. I felt depressed, became self-destructive. I wanted to die... I felt awful, I was even admitted to a hospital... I couldn't even take care of my son... but I got over the crisis. Then I found out he was arrested... with his gang... because of credit card fraud and other things. But he'd already been released. And when I came back, he'd invaded the apartment by force. Then I told him what had happened... that I didn't think that was right... and that we should separate. He got his gun and said he wouldn't accept... a separation... that he'd kill me if I left him. I said he could kill me... but I was leaving, that he'd only kill me if he were a man. And I left. After I left, I went through hard times. I had no skills, I had no money, I had to pay for my pension room. And I couldn't be with my son at the pension room. A girl who lived at the pension said: "The only thing you can do is work. Are you getting a job? What do you do?" Nothing, I told her. I never worked, I never did anything. So she said there was a way. I could turn tricks. I asked her what was that. I really didn't know what that was. Then I had my first john. It didn't last a year. That I won't say. Thank God it wasn't. It was less. Because another angel appeared in my life. And it was Ledão... who took me to do a test with Haroldo Costa. Let's surprise Haroldo? Let's go. Can we come in? Hi, Mary. I didn't know you were coming. Look who I brought here as a surprise. CHOREOGRAPHER Are you okay? Boss, my boss. How are you, boss? That's great. Thanks, thank you. Hi there. How are you? Are you okay? Everything's fine. We were doing a series of shows about folklore and carnaval... ARTISTIC PRODUCER and we had some girls with us. And Leda... would be part of the show. One day she showed up with this girl... we later found out it was Rita. Once, twice, three times. But Rita just came as a friend. The show was over, they'd go out. That was the first time I saw Rita. And she hung out with Leda... until the day Mary, my wife... invited her to participate, if she wanted to do a test... to be part of the group, or someone didn't show up... one of those things that happen in shows. We're missing a girl. And Rita came in. She came in and stayed. I started holding... as a chorus girl. Holding up the Afro decoration. I'd hold up the totem. And I learned the choreography, I started in the back... then I kept coming forward, forward, forward. Then I was in the front. Of all the dances, that's how I ended up. I first saw Rita in a meeting... with Haroldo Costa and Mary, who's his wife and choreographer. A shy girl... PERFORMANCE ARTIST with this lovely ass. That boy ass, you know? Because the most perfect ass is a man's ass... which is very firm, it won't fall. Rogéria showed up in one of the shows... when we were going to travel... we were going to Puerto Rico. She showed up in my life... and said, "Look, you're a very beautiful... hot, sexy girl, but you don't know how to use that." First thing, change the hair. I changed my hair color... She basically taught me makeup. Rogéria, is my eye right? Did I get this okay? Am I stopping okay? She had a lot of talent, it was very easy, and I taught her the glamour. Because I learned a very important thing: A woman is touch, a woman is mind and feelings. And she taught me to be sexy... to use the eyes, to use... my sexiness, to use the body. She encouraged me to be... a feminine copy of her. CENTRAL AMERICA AND USA TOUR IN 1973 We were in Puerto Rico. We'd go then to New York. I said, "Come here, dear. I'm not against prostitution... but there are some guys running after you... not hustlers... guys that are American millionaires. Why don't you take some 100 million from these guys?" She said, "Rogéria, that's not my thing." And I couldn't believe that. Because there were many men interested in her. Beautiful Puerto Rico men. I would play "Land me your ass". And she gave me a big help with one thing. She pushed me into Pelé's arms. Because there were over 40 women there. I don't know how many there were. And he got interested in me. I didn't want... and she'd say "Go. You are hot. He wants you". So I went. Let's see what happens. We went out, had diner and then we had a night of love. Two nights of love, and that was it. But what really called my attention about Rita... was that she had that amazing body... but she talked non-stop about her son. My son... I have to make money for my son, his schooling. When I got the job with Haroldo Costa... I took Carlos Cezar to stay with his father... and told him I'd be back to get him. He said okay. But it wasn't okay, because I only got my son back... when he was nine. If Chacrinha was on, they changed the channel. RITA'S SON They told me she was dead... then I answered the phone and it was her. So I had conflicts with my father from early on. It was a huge fight. I wanted to be with my mother... I didn't want to be with my dad. I was forbidden to see him, and when he let me see my son... it was at the door to his house, his mother's house. And one day I kidnapped Carlos Cezar. My husband came after me, then we reached an agreement. You're not going to say I died... you won't say I abandoned him. You're going to let me have him back. My life began to change... My life began to change when I started living with her. That's when my childhood began... IN 1991 CARLOS CEZAR RETURNED TO LIVE WITH RITA when I had a mother. There were times when Rita Cadillac opened my mind to the world... she explained everything to me, what happened out there. She was my friend. But Rita de Cássia was the one who got angry... sent me to my room, told me to study, gave sermons... she was the mother. Me turning into a singer. It was Luis Andrade who thought that up. That was before I left Chacrinha. At the time I was Gretchen's agent. Rita's first agent I had launched her too. There was this film called "Aluga-se Moças"... that Rita starred in. I saw the movie and thought Rita was good in it. And I remembered that. She wasn't the star... she was a supporting actress. I thought her image was interesting. I thought it was interesting she was very photogenic. I met him on the street... and he made the invitation, and I accepted. She said, "Gee, Luis, Chacrinha isn't well. I think everyone's going to be fired. It's going to end... he's going to the hospital. He's very sick." I said, Rita, I have a huge market... for work like yours as a model. Do you sing?" I told him it wouldn't work, that I didn't know how to sing. He said, "No, no, you don't have to know. Come over and we'll start." I told her I had a house at Recreio, I had some caretakers there... and I would take her to live there. She would only have to do the Chacrinha shows... and I would begin to prepare her. It was funny, he taught me to behave... on stage. Until then I was just a dancer... I didn't have the responsibility of being on stage... of commanding the show. She had everything. Dance lessons, singing lessons, stylist. He wanted me to be Rita Cadillac 24 hours a day. That's not what I am. To this day... I can't be her all day long. I can't wake up, put on high heels... put on makeup, get dressed... and go for a stroll, walk, go shopping. Everything I did had to be like that. I had to get up and sleep like that. The funny thing was rehearsing the show. What were we going to do? We had two songs. You have to help yourself Don't let it grow cold Leave it all for later Just think of us two It's good for morale Don't say anything to anyone But in this coming and going We know how we do it And always want more It's good for morale She grows when she gets on stage... and people fall in love for the game. RITA'S AGENT Luis made up a game. The game was like this. They put four guys on stage... and eliminated one by one. The guys would dance. Who danced the best? Then only the best would stay. And this one got to kiss her ass. It was a simulation of the erotic, not pornographic. I remember I had some chocolate asses made. Get it? So she came to the show and gave everyone an ass. The chocolate ass. And the guys... and that game and all worked. It was the time, right? The thing worked, that kind of thing. So I said, that's the gold mine. What does Brazil likes? It likes an ass. It was sexy, just real sexy. I didn't even have to sing, really. It was just moaning and dancing. Her name was stronger than any song. The marketing was in the eroticism, the supposed eroticism. People thought she'd be naked. There'll be a festival, she'll do a strip-tease. And that wasn't it. People like it, clapped... hired us again, because it was a hoot, a celebration. A party, see? And she would do 30, 40 shows a month, see? It was a radical change in her life. And now the transformation. The artist on stage. Our star up close, Rita Cadillac. Come Come closer to me We were made to do it Sujinho... I have to go to work. I know we're missing some products. Like that smell. - Fennel. - It's not that. It's Stilus. One more of that one. Ok. Are you going for a walk? - No. Going to work. - Ok. Bye. When I accepted, it was because I knew that the Rita Cadillac... shows couldn't go on for much longer. I couldn't go much further. I didn't have many miles more, so the damage was minimal. I wouldn't be risking much. I wasn't risking a whole life. It wasn't vanity. It would be vanity if I said... I have a movie with this guy, that guy. But a porn movie? No. That was strictly for the money. The money they offered... was the money I needed then. For my home, my son's home... to have another apartment to have some income... that could pay at least some bills. I looked her in the eye and said, "You're over 50, man. Nobody pays your bills. You want to do it?" I applauded her. I told her to do it. Do it, because this is your chance. Stop making it easy for everyone else. But of course she'd have to do it. You really have to do it. We talked a lot. Lurdinha was the only one who objected. But she did that as a mother... she did it as a manager. Yeah, that's not what I wanted. I didn't want that for her and I did my best... I tried all I could, but there's no condemnation. I said, "Rita, you've carried the name for so long. If you can sleep easy, then do it." The first scenes were easy, I just had to dance... be sexy. Something I'd always done. I thought, okay. But then the director looked at me and said: "Now we have the sex scenes." That's when the reality sank in. And a guy grabbed me and penetrated me. And I saw that, and the director with the camera... Open the leg more, close the leg now. The feeling I had then... was that they were sticking a knife in me and cutting me open. I felt bad... I felt dirty, I felt everything. Every bad feeling a person can feel... I felt at that moment. Let's go, Angel. Run, run. "AMAZON GOLD" - DOCUMENTARY BY BBC And Luis took me to the mining camp. And he went with me on the tour to the camp... when the plane crashed with us both. We went there on a single engine plane... and there was a problem. The plane fell and she was terrified on my back. She was in front of me. And I was behind her, holding her. We're gonna fall. We're gonna fall. The plane turned and turned and fell on a tree. We walked in the middle of the jungle. I put a cap on her head, some cloths on her head. We managed to walk a lot in the mud, in the rain. Luis carried by suitcase on his head. Me in tiny shorts and sandals in the mud. Then a truck came by, with pigs and everything. And there's Rita in the middle of the pigs... till we got to Serra Pelada, where no women went. The first thing I saw was all these men taking a bath, naked. I saw those statues of men... those big brutes. All covered in mud. I looked at them and said, "I'm done, I'm dead." There were 300,000 men. No women. We stayed in the federal police barracks. A bunk bed, she on top, me on the bottom. She couldn't leave there. But they were so shameless, so shameless... that a week before the show... they screened the movie "Aluga-se moças"... the one with the car scene, the first one. So when I got there, the guys were at their limit. They were really hungry. The show was set up inside... this circus tent. I froze on the first show. When Luis said, "Now the show's on. Go on." I said, "Okay.", and went on. I went on, looked and said I wanted to leave. I was the only woman there, half naked, wearing this tiny bathing suit... with some fringes, surrounded by who knows how many thousands of men. I thought, "Man, I'm done for." He turned on the music, told me to dance. I danced. In the middle of the song, I began to feel these... I looked, turned to Luis, said... they weren't liking it. They were throwing stones at me. And he, "Idiot, that's gold. It's gold nuggets." She must have made a lot of gold in Serra Pelada. All those gold camps... all the camps in Mato Grosso. And that was it. Taking a message to a very needy people. Lurdinha went to several mining camps. The one with Barba was very funny... because we got there and Barba was the sheriff... he like owned the camp. So we did the show and during the show... there was the game where I called four boys... to dance with me. But the guys had to dance... send kisses. They had to repeat all I did. And I was naughty. I would make those men... Those big men, all sweaty to dance... shake their asses. And the one who won... could chose his present... and there was one who asked for a night with me. But this guy was new there. So during the show he began to be cute... say some things. And the game was over and he thought he was taking me. He was taking me right then. I told him: "No, let me finish the show, or I won't get paid." The bottom line, he was quiet, but he drank a lot. And he started shooting. And the guy was, you put out or you die. Man, the guy began to shoot. We had to duck into a cabin... until they calmed him down. Then Barba heard about the mess, went there, got the guy... disappeared the guy. I never saw him again. Mangos on offer! I told you I'd come. - He won't eat these kind of things. - Yeah, the kids are like that. Everything I like, he won't eat. It's the same at home. That's how it is. Tell me, honey. Where are your daughters? How's everything? - More ripe or more green? - No. Halfway. - Not green and not ripe. - From tomorrow on it's okay? - From tomorrow on, yeah. - Can it be the whole bunch? Fifteen? - Sure. Why not? - Fifteen, twenty. Three reais. Real cheap. Strawberry and cashew, 1.50 now. Tell me, honey. It's too much, it's good. You've got the keys? - You have the keys there? - Yeah. I'd seen her around and after a while... she came to live nearby. And we became friends. During one of her birthdays, maybe... the one before last... I think she was turning... I'm not sure if she was turning 50. But at night, with everyone at the party... I was talking with the gang... RITA'S FIANCÉ and she called me inside to help with something. I had to help her with the gas or something. But she really didn't want any help. I called you, grabbed you and you... "Hey, everyone's here, we can't do this," and you left. - That's a lie. - And you left the party, too. I didn't know what to do. I didn't expect it. I wasn't expecting that. So you don't know what to do. - Embarrassing, huh? - So I went back... to the party. But I didn't leave. You disappeared. I didn't see you anymore. There were 30, 40 people. You wanted to find me with 40 people? You were the one I grabbed. I would see you. - No, I didn't run away. - Yeah, you did. You don't expect someone like her to... You don't think it'll happen with you. I was just a friend. You don't think a friendship will become... something else. And it happened for me. Kind of lucky, huh? The dream I have for us is to go on until the last day... of my life. I have this dream of a family. That's a great dream of mine. And now I'm having it. With him I can have in-laws, brother-in-law... niece, uncles, aunts and all these things... I never had and that now I'm beginning to have. If it's not this, there's one across the street. Thank you, okay. I came back from a trip and I got a message from my sister. That my sister had called. I said, "Sister?" I called and said: "I want to talk with Raíra." And she said, "Yes, it's she." "It's Rita. You called saying you're my sister." She told me that she was my sister... that she didn't know, that she'd been adopted, and her adoptive mother... died and before she died, she told her the truth... that she was Geni's daughter. - Geni, your mother. - Yeah, Geni, my mother. And therefore was my sister. Not my sister on my father's side. Raíra? It's Rita. I'll open so you can come up. Okay. She's not in. - Hi. - Hi there. Please ignore the mess. - How are you? - I'm fine. - How are things? - Everything's fine. - You're the nephew. - Yeah. How are you? RITA'S NEPHEW - Nice to meet you. How are you? - Fine. We came to surprise Raíra. Where is she? The supermarket. We came to surprise Raíra, but Raíra... surprised us. Yeah. And I told her: "Don't go to the supermarket". But she went anyway. It's so hot. - I don't believe it. - How are you? - I'm fine. And you? - How are you? Fine. Thank God, everything's fine. That's great. Look at her. - What do you think? - We look alike? RITA'S SISTER I had blonde hair, now it's black. Now it's black. - It's so great to meet you. - After 64 years, Rita. - 64? - I've just turned 64. Congratulations. You look great. - 64 years old. - That's great. I loved it, you know why? I have one, too. I have two of them. I have two black ones called Naomi and Angel. This here is Brisa and there's Kika, the white one. I saw them. - It's really great. - Let's talk more. - Because now, friend... - God's will. There's no other way, now. My treasure, my boyfriend. My love. Good morning. - Are you taking the ones for the girls? - It's better right? It's more guaranteed. Because they're coming early. I'm coming in early, too. It's lovely. Look. It's so lovely. Bye, kids. Thanks. Good luck. See you tomorrow. - Your official bouquet. - This is my official bouquet. This is the one you throw. - There are for the bridesmaids. - Bridesmaids. The groom needs good luck, because he doesn't know he's getting married. - He doesn't know? - No. The groom doesn't know he's going to marry tomorrow. - No? - No... ...it's a surprise. - That's quite a surprise. - He's going to have a shock. - Thank you, guys. - Good luck. - Thanks. Have a nice wedding. APRIL 1 ST 2007 - Are you nervous? - Yeah. Where's Luis? Then hold him. Give me five minutes. - Yeah. Okay. Bye. - Let me do it, honey. Look, I'm just going to leave the keys in the starter... because the alarm starts up alone sometimes. Are you okay, man? Are you calm? I just want to play a game with you. Man, that's not nice. Put on the blindfold, put the blindfold on him. Hold on. No one goes in without a blindfold. He's coming. - I just saw him. - Is he coming up blindfolded? I don't know. I couldn't see. You're beautiful. Beautiful, hear? God bless you. My love Is secret Is sacred It's preserved In my heart I'll get you. I didn't suspect anything. - Did you like it? - Of course. O Lord, bless these rings this couple will wear... now as a sign of their love. In the name of the Father... the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen. I'm speechless. All I can say is that I love you very much. Will you say bow-wow for me? - Bow-wow. - No, it's not like that. Wait. But it's like this. Bow-wow. CARANDIRU PENITENTIARY - 1986 Now another animal. Come on. Come here. Get on all fours for me. You on this side. Get on all fours. Now you each chose a side and kiss my butt. The first time I entered a prison in my life... was in Rio. It was terrible. The feeling was awful. I cried. I swore I'd never go to a prison again. When I went to Carandiru... there was no sense of death, no ugly things... none of that. It was a happy thing. There were children. You didn't feel in danger. The convicts decided to call her a godmother. During the graduations of the courses for the inmates... FORMER CARANDIRU EMPLOYEE many inmates didn't have a godmother... a family member to get the diploma with them. And she would go with them because they had no families. Move your tush Let's dance It was a strange relationship. On one side, they were very aroused by her. When she performed, you could see that... she provoked this desire in the men. A carnal temptation. But they also felt great respect for her. And she really provoked them. You couldn't believe she could do that. I once saw Rita in a tiny dress... DOCTOR handing out autographs, at this gallery... kneeling in a way that... She wasn't wearing any. I watched the men's reactions. They would have a quick... embarrassed look... pretend they hadn't, smile a little. But she had their respect. She had their total respect. I never was in any danger in the prison. Never. They said, "You don't worry in here. You're more protected here than out there." I met Rita on a hot afternoon in December. We had a contest in prison talking about AIDS. The show began with this group... called "Together by Chance". They played and Rita came on, dancing. She danced and the hall... was in total silence. Then they began to cry out, "Turn, turn." She pretended she didn't understand. She threatened to turn... then didn't. And the cries got louder. Turn, turn! Then it was marvelous. She turned and began to dance. She would turn and bend lower and lower, and suddenly get up. And when she got up, the place came down. At the time, 17% of the inmates had HIV. The medical wards were full. We lost 2, 3 inmates... a week in the prison. People who died and never got out. And she got interested in doing these messages. Talk about condoms. The things now is to use a condom. Because AIDS is getting ugly. The thing is to wear a condom, okay? Did you use any objects like I saw in the movie, "Carandiru?" The bottle? No. That was something Hector Babenco made up. I talked with Drauzio and he told me no. FILMMAKER That Rita was one thing and the sexual education... thing in the prison was separate. I didn't want to make that part... very didactic... so let's talk of entertainment and of... sexual education. I brought the two together... and that was really a creation of mine. I was afraid people would think... that was what I did at Carandiru. And I never did that. And to make it very clear... I never received any pay. My only reward was the love I received. Voulez, voulez Dance, dance Forward, back For all her shows, Rita went prepared with panties. During the show, she'd take off the panties... and throw them to the inmates. The inmate... who caught the panties would celebrate. There was even a raffle. Those panties would be around for months. One year, instead of just throwing it, what did she do? She decided to change the show. She called an inmate... to the stage. He came up to participate in the show. He'd have to take off the panties with his teeth. What happened? She realized... the inmate was toothless. He had no teeth. - He used his tongue. - She turned to me... and said "He has no teeth." But he managed to take it off with his tongue. This woman intrigued me a lot. Kind of androgynous... half car, half human being. I thought it was funny, a woman of her age... unmentionable, of course... wearing those strong Lycra pantyhose... the color of darker skin to hold together... that physical presence. And it's something very shameless, very Brazilian... and incredibly naive. So a person who gets up on a stage... that is up there and is capable, a woman with a thousand people... like I saw, capable of doing an erotic dance like that one... and call the attention of all those people... with the greatest respect is an artist. If she's not an artist, who is? I think the work she does is of a beautiful stimulus. So naive, so elementary... so basic that I really give her a hand. I really give her a hand. When I come back, I want to be Rita Cadillac. - Hi, Rita? How are you? - Hi. The kids came today. They came. Today I'll see my babies. - Good night. How are you? - How are you? Today is an unusual day. The kids came with me. Let's go, girl. It's her. The super lady. Rita Cadillac. When will I stop making shows? When they let me. I'll stop when they let me. But I think it's close, very close. I'm in that kind of position. I have the hand on the lock to open... to stop the shows. There's no point in being perfect and empty. It wasn't talent, it wasn't my voice... that opened doors. It was my body. Like Rita Lee said... "It's the only ass that thinks." So it's my ass that thinks. My brain is here. There's no other way. I have to face that, I have to accept it. I accept that my body made me. I, Rita Cadillac, live off my body. There's a little Rita de Cássia here. Now there's a lot of Rita Cadillac here.
