This story is about a rebellious young Brave called Starbird and the truths he discovered. (roaring plane engine) - [Starbird Voiceover] Let me see, did he say turn the wheel left and step on the right pedal to turn right? Or was that to turn left? Oh boy, this isn't as easy as it was yesterday. (roaring plane engine) (buzzing and grinding) (snapping) (whooshing) (crow squawks) (moody atmospheric music) (groans) (groans) (raccoon squeaks) - [Man] Starbird? Nadine? - [Starbird] Nadine, will you marry me? - I might, if you'd only change your ways. - A man is what he is. - Sometimes I think you're ashamed of being an Indian. - I'm not. - But you are not proud of it. Are you? - What's there to be proud of? - Starbird, why do you try so hard to be different? To always oppose our way. - Some people have choices in life! Decisions to make. They get to choose where they wanna live, what they wanna do, who they wanna be. They're free! That's all I'm asking. Just a chance to choose my own life. Will you come with me? - No, Starbird. I can't. - You're a coward, Starbird! You're a disgrace to all of us. (tense music) Leave here, Starbird, forever! - We were friends once, Ramheart. Now you've turned against me. Why? - You don't deserve the honor of being a member of this tribe. (rhythmic tribal music) - You shouldn't scorn, Starbird. You should take part. - [Starbird] Why, Grandfather? - You forget, the ritual is for us. Not for those who look on. You bear a proud name, Starbird. As I look at you now, I do not see an Indian Brave. - [Narrator] Starbird was hurt by his grandfather's blunt words. And his pride was stung. So he hotheadedly turned in his ceremonial necklace. A symbol of being a member of the tribe. Now he knows for certain he must leave the reservation, and make a life for himself elsewhere. (somber acoustic guitar music) (car horn honks) - Where you headed? - No place. - [Driver] It's pretty rugged country, isn't it? A man could get himself lost in there, have one heck of a time finding his way out. - [Starbird] Yeah. - [Driver] You lookin' for some kind of work? - [Starbird] More or less. - Well, we're diggin' some browse ways. - What are they? - Well they're traffic lanes through very dense brush to allow the browse animals like deer better access to their natural food supply. I don't know for sure that they're lookin' for any hands right now but if you're interested, you could ask. - Oh I don't know, I... I sort of like to fool around with motors. - Well, now we've got an equipment depot at Mount Meadow, and there's an airport about two-three miles down the road. Maybe that's what you're lookin' for. (buzzing and whirring propeller) (roaring plane engine) - [Pilot] Is this your first flight? - [Starbird] Yeah. Boy, things sure look different from up here. - [Pilot] Go ahead, try it. (moody wind music) - [Narrator] Starbird was really excited about flying. Soaring up there with the eagles was the kind of freedom he'd had bottled up inside himself for a long time. So, he didn't really mean to steal the airplane, he just got carried away and borrowed it for a little while. (buzzing and whirring propeller) (roaring plane engine) (buzzing and grinding) (snapping and whooshing) (Starbird groans) When Starbird regained consciousness, he knew he was in serious trouble. His whole body hurt. His arm was broken. And he was a long, long way from civilization. (crow squawks) The plane. (ominous music) He'd better salvage anything from it he could use. He'd need the hatchet and the matches for sure, but the thermos bottle was broken. Wait a minute. Maybe the pilot had put his lunch in the plane. (Starbird groans) Seeing the young deer was comforting. It reminded him he wasn't really alone in the wilderness, and he remembered something his grandfather had said long ago. (wind music) - [Grandfather] Animals are our brothers. We must help them whenever we can. Remember that, Starbird. - Yes, Grandfather. (crow squawks) (upbeat folk music) (crow squawks) - [Narrator] The pain in his broken arm was intense. He knew the bone must be set, and he must do it himself. (tense music) (Starbird groans) (moody atmospheric music) (raccoon squeaks) (crow squawks) (crow squawks) (crow squawks) (approaching plane) - Hey! Down here! Hey! Help me! (somber acoustic guitar music) - [Narrator] Now, Katie Crow had been lookin' at that sack and wonderin' what was in it ever since Starbird sat it down. - Get out of there! - [Narrator] Well, no need to be rude. I was leaving anyway. (moody tribal music) - [Starbird Voiceover] Grandfather always said, "if you're lost in the woods, follow a river downstream." I guess I'll give it a try. - [Narrator] Seeing the baby foxes and the young deer, Starbird had a warm feeling of kinship with his brothers, the animals. Something he'd really never felt before. As he watched young Bandini the deer, Starbird suddenly realized she was in danger. (suspenseful music) (cougar growls) (Starbird whistles) (cougar roars) - [Narrator] Old Man Cougar hadn't eaten for days, and he could practically taste that tender young deer. When that man thing scared it off. Now he was gonna have to run his legs off to get a meal. Drat that man thing anyway. What is it doing in this part of the forest? If it didn't smell so bad, (cougar roars) he was half a mind to eat it instead. Of course he'd heard they tasted terrible. (melancholic piano music) (crow squawks) (jaunty upbeat music) (raccoon squeaks) - Hello, little fellow. Are you hungry, too? - [Narrator] Well, it sure didn't look like Starbird was gonna be lonesome. (crow squawks) - You want some too? (crow squawks) (crow squawks) (raccoon squeaks) (bear roars) You go away, I don't want your momma comin' around! (cougar roars) (suspenseful music) (cougar roars) (cougar roars) - [Narrator] Trying to do things with one hand was tough, but if you thought it through first, you could do most anything, Starbird discovered. (playful music) As usual, Brother Bear was lookin' things over. Well, what have we here? A cave? Funny-lookin' cave. Sure wasn't made for short, fat bears. Well, pretty poor cave. Got a big hole in it. (xylophone glissando) - Back for dessert, huh? (owl hoots) (peaceful piano music) (wolf howls) (peaceful orchestral music) - [Narrator] Starbird was awakened by the feel of a rough tongue. It was friendly Brother Bear again. Starbird was still concerned that the cub's mother might show up and bad-tempered. Starbird couldn't know it of course, but, little Brother Bear was an orphan. (atmospheric wind music) (suspenseful music) (cougar roars) Starbird didn't like the way Old Man Cougar was lurkin' around growlin'. He decided he better cut himself a spear for protection. (cougar growls) (cougar growls) (cougar growls) (cougar growls) (peaceful orchestral music) (raccoon squeaks) - Goodbye, little fellas. Stay out of trouble. - [Narrator] He felt a growing fondness for the little fellas and wondered what would happen to 'em after he was gone. (crow squawks) (suspenseful music) (cougar roars) (peaceful upbeat music) (raccoon squeaks) - [Starbird] You're gonna get your feet wet, little raccoon. (raccoon squeaks) - [Narrator] Naturally, Brother Bear intended going along, too. But first, he had to investigate this strange-lookin' tree that Starbird had built. Hmm. Well, it smelled like any ordinary old tree. Nothin' hangin' on it good to eat. Oops! Well, not much of a tree. Too flimsy. (suspenseful music) (cougar growls) (cougar roars) (joyful music) (raccoon squeaks) Roger Raccoon didn't have very good manners when it came to food. Mmm, boy! It's time for breakfast! (crow squawks) And Katie Crow who could spot food a country-mile hollered out "hey, how about some of that apple for me!" Of course it sounded just like "caw, caw" to Starbird, but he knew what she meant. (crow squawks) - Well, here's our friend again. Welcome, Brother Bear. You lonesome? Where's your momma? (raccoon squeaks) Somebody turn her into a rug? - [Narrator] Where is it? Don't tell me you ate it all, you pig! Raccoon, I ought to lay one on ya! (crow squawks) (raccoon squeaks) When he looked across at the splendor of the snow-capped peaks, it gave Starbird a strange feeling. It almost seemed he'd been there before. One of the legends of the Indian people is that the Great Spirit lives on the top of the mountain. Starbird felt a strong urge to go there. (suspenseful keys) (upbeat piano music) - What have you got there? Sweet William, huh? - [Narrator] And that's how Brother Bear got the name of Sweet William. - Well, come on, Sweet William! (crow squawks) - [Narrator] Old Man Cougar was waiting. Hungry and mean. And everybody knew he meant trouble. (suspenseful music) (raccoon squeaks) (cougar growls) (cougar roars) (crow squawks) Sweet William and Roger were both really frightened. There comes a time when a man must put his courage to the test. (cougar roars) (cougar roars) (cougar roars) Starbird knew he must face Old Man Cougar, no matter what happened. - Now I know a mountain lion doesn't wanna attack a human, but if you wanna mess with my friends here, you're gonna have to mess with me. Come on, move. Move! (cougar roars) (cougar roars) (cougar roars) (crow squawks) (cougar roars) Get out, move! (cougar roars) (crow squawks) (cougar roars) (crow squawks) (raccoon squeaks) (cougar roars) (cougar roars) (cougar roars) (cougar roars) (raccoon squeaks) (cougar growls) (raccoon squeaks) (cougar growls) (raccoon squeaks) - [Narrator] Old Man Cougar didn't care for this business of being jabbed with a sharp stick. (crow squawks) - Thanks for your help. (peaceful music) Hey, that tickles. (crow squawks) (raccoon squeaks) Sweet William? (upbeat banjo music) Thanks to you too, Sweet William. (crow squawks) - [Narrator] Sweet William just remembered that his momma had taught him those things swimmin' were good to eat. - By golly, you did it. You're not a bad fisherman, Sweet William. (upbeat piano music) (raccoon squeaks) Here! Raccoons gotta eat, too. (crow squawks) - [Narrator] Katie yelled down, "Hey! "What about me?" (crow squawks) Not bad. Not bad at all. (crow squawks) (raccoon squeaks) - Sweet William? Sweet William! Hey, bear! (raccoon squeaks) (crow squawks) Sweet William! (playful organ music) - [Narrator] Sweet William had, of course, heard Starbird calling, but he was having such a good time, he just couldn't be bothered right now. Well, well! Hello there! You look like an interesting fella! Wanna wrestle? Phew, no wonder he's in the creek. That fella really needs a bath. (raccoon squeaks) - Sweet William! Come on down, Sweet William! Hold everything! - [Narrator] Roger was disgusted. Let that dumb bear get down the best way he can. Starbird, you're gonna fall and hurt yourself again! Careful, Starbird. Easy. Easy. (crow squawks) (raccoon squeaks) (crow squawks) (raccoon squeaks) (raccoon squeaks) - Oh, not again. Hey, Sweet William! Hold on there! - [Narrator] Suddenly it dawned on Starbird that Sweet William was trying to lead him somewhere. That the bear must know of a place he wanted Starbird to see. (joyful music) (raccoon squeaks) (peaceful atmospheric music) - Hm, what do ya know? Sure would like to go up that mountain and look around. Well, Sweet William, it looks like a long way around. You feel like comin' along? (Sweet William growls) Okay, come on. There's gotta be an easier way to get there. (raccoon squeaks) You comin' too, little raccoon? You may have an idea there, little fella. What do ya think, Sweet William? Ain't gonna be easy, maybe even impossible, but it's worth a try. (crow squawks) (crow squawks) Where'd you come from? (crow squawks) (joyful music) (raccoon squeaks) - [Narrator] Starbird discovered that building a raft with one hand is one heck of a job. (Starbird groans) (crow squawks) (raccoon squeaks) - All right, all aboard. - [Narrator] Starbird had a lot more confidence in his raft than Roger who eyed it suspiciously. "It'll never make it," he thought. "We'll end up swimming for our lives." - Come on, Sweet William. (raccoon squeaks) (peaceful music) - [Narrator] Easy, you big lama. You'll sink us before we get started. That's right, stupid. Fall off and tear the boat up trying to get back aboard. Back ashore, Bandini watched them head out, then tore off around the lake to meet 'em on the other side. (raccoon squeaks) - Sit down, you two, you're rockin' the boat. (creaking) (raccoon squeaks) (Sweet William growls) (suspenseful music) Hang on, Sweet William! Hang on! I'm coming! Don't jump, Sweet William! Stay! Hang on, Sweet William! Crazy bear. (raccoon squeaks) (upbeat music) - [Narrator] Sweet William was amazed, delighted, and a little bit frightened of the snow. It was fun to run and slide on, and it didn't taste bad. (suspenseful music) (guns fire) He'd never heard a gun before, but he didn't need anybody to tell him it meant danger. - How could you miss a bear in close? - 'Cause he ducked, that's why. Which way did he go? - That'a way. - I'll get him the next time. (xylophone glissando) (joyful music) - [Narrator] When Starbird saw the hunters, he knew Sweet William was in deadly danger. Starbird's first thought was to distract the hunters from Sweet William and give him a chance to get away. (wood snaps) (suspenseful piano music) (raccoon squeaks) (sliding whistle) - Hey, it's over here! (playful music) - No! He's over here. - [Narrator] Roger got the idea from Starbird, and decided he'd do a little distracting, too. (wood cracks) - What was that? (suspenseful piano music) (thud) - I could have swore I seen him. - Well he ain't here, that's for darn sure. Sure is a small one for all this trouble. - Them's the best eatin'. - That's right. (upbeat piano music) (crow squawks) What you jumpin' for? (laughs) - Who's jumpin'? - It's just an old crow, that's all. - I know it! There he is! - There he is! (guns fire) - (laughs) I think I winged him! - Come on! You missed him clean, he's done gone and give us the slip. - I swear I seen him start up that mountain. - Well he ain't gonna make time climbin'. - Well there's some snow up there. He'll be leavin' tracks, more than likely. - Let's go for it. (upbeat blues music) Ain't been up this far in quite a spell. - Seems a lot further than I thought. Ain't much further to the timber line. He'll be easier to track in the open. - Yeah, if it doesn't get dark before we get there. - Sweet William! Little raccoon! (raccoon squeaks) I was beginning to think I'd lost you. When I was a kid on the reservation, we used to gather them nuts by the bushel. We'd sell 'em for uh, a few pennies. Indian nuts, they called 'em. They were darn good eatin', too. (raccoon squeaks) (crow squawks) (crow squawks) (joyful piano music) - Hey, here's a print, real clear, too. - Here's another one over here. Can't see how we can miss him now. That bear's up on this mountain. - Yeah, sure seems like it. Only one thing, though. - What? - Gonna be gettin' dark before long, and I ain't aimin' to get caught up here in the night. - You mean, you gonna let that critter get away, after all that climbin' we done? - Them prints will still be here in the mornin'. So will the bear. - Well I don't know. - We'll come back up here first thing after sun's up. Gets mighty cold up here after dark. - Well, I don't know. I sure would hate to lose that cub after all the work we been to. Maybe you got a point there, anyway. - Come on. Will you come on! (bluesy jingle) (playful chimes) (raccoon squeaks) (peaceful piano music) - [Narrator] Starbird noticed it more and more. Animals of the forest were no longer hiding from him, and that even the elusive foxes now openly performed their courtship rights while he watched. (raccoon squeaks) - Sweet William! I was pretty darn sure I'd seen the last of you, bear. Alive, anyway.

(upbeat piano music) I'm sure glad I got you fellas around to keep me warm. Good, huh? Can't beat mountain cookin'. Grandfather, I... - [Narrator] Snug in the cave with his friends, Starbird felt a closeness with the night. In the distance, a coyote howled, like a lost devil child. And he heard the footfalls of a mountain lion creeping softly across the snow in the stillness. He thought of the mysteries of life. Of father sky and mother earth. And a feeling of contentment came over him. - Go to sleep, you guys! (bluesy piano music) (peaceful piano music) - [Bearded Hunter] Only one way he could have gone. - Where? - Up, ya darned old fool! (upbeat blues music) Look! - I see him! - Is that him? - There he is! - Now. Now! - You're too darn slow. - Now. Now. (gun fires) (crow squawks) (gun fires) (crow squawks) Stand right where you are. - Just don't budge and nobody's gonna get hurt. - Have you been followin' me? - That there bear. - His pelt's no good to you, he's just a cub. - [Hunter] Those are the best eatin' kind, eh, partner? - None better I know of. Kindly oblige us by stepping aside there, Indian. - No. - We didn't aim to do no killin', human that is, but we can. - And sure enough will, too. (Sweet William growls) - Hold it, right there! Drop those guns behind you. Slow. Now! Before I give you a load of this buckshot. Pick up the guns, boy. Empty the shells. Now look in their pockets and make sure they got no more. (dissonant piano keys) Okay. Pick up your guns and get goin', you two. (upbeat blues music) (sliding whistle) (sliding whistle) - [Narrator] Good heavens, what was this? - Whoa. - [Narrator] Sweet William had already had enough excitement for one day. And now this great beast with long ears showed up. - Howdy. - Hello. - I seen a bit of smoke up here last night. Figured it might be a campfire. - Well, you figured right. - [Ranger] Decided I better take a look. - Well, it's a good thing for us you did. - Indian, ain't ya? - Yes. They call my Starbird. - Ain't often I get to see another human being. - No, I guess not. - Name's Mattie. - Nice to meet ya, Mattie. - I best be goin'. I got other things to do. You can come along if you mind to. You're welcome. - Don't mind if I do. Come on, you two. (upbeat piano music) (crow squawks) - You Indians sure got a way with critters. - Animals are our friends. - That be your airplane down there in the valley? - No. - Just thought I'd ask. - Not that plane! What I mean is, I don't actually own it, but I sort of borrowed it. - You stole it. - Well I meant to bring it back. I know it was a crazy thing to do, but I just wanted to fly so bad, and I really did mean to bring it back. - They'll be comin' for ya on account of that airplane. Ain't gonna be easy to make them believe what you say. - I know. - Got me a trap somewhere. - A trap? - It's humane. Instant kill. Legal. - You know, I could have gotten myself killed doin' what I did, but I think it was worth the risk, 'cause I learned somethin'. Somethin' I won't soon forget. I found out why my forefathers loved the land they lived on. They had to struggle hard to survive but, they were happy doing it. I think I know why now. - Huh. Ain't even touched the bait. No tracks neither. - Maybe there aren't as many animals around as there used to be. - Person's got a right to try to make a livin'. - By killin'? - Ain't stealin'! Come on, baby. - No. (somber acoustic guitar music) - [Mattie] Ain't likely to go easy on you, Starbird. - [Starbird] I know. - [Mattie] A man can hide from the law just so long, even in these mountains. And then what? - [Starbird] I don't know, Mattie, I just don't know. I'm not a criminal. - [Mattie] The law could say different. - [Starbird] You know, when I crashed that plane, I was just glad to be alive, all I wanted was just to get down the hill. After three days, I'm not so sure I ever wanna leave. - Well, better make up your mind, boy. That way will take you down the mountain. And that way will take you back up into the woods. It's up to you. (peaceful orchestral music) - Thanks, Mattie. (raccoon squeaks) (raccoon squeaks) (laughs) Goodbye, little raccoon. (raccoon squeaks) Now Sweet William, you stay here with Mattie. (Sweet William growls) I'll miss ya but don't worry 'cause I'll be back, Sweet William. - Well, I was wonderin' about you, Bandini. (crow squawks) (crow squawks) - How will I find you, Mattie? - Don't you worry, Starbird. We'll find you when you come back. - [Starbird Voiceover] When I have forgotten my pride, when I am filled with love for all your creatures, lead me, oh father sky. In your love I shall grow, o ancient one, until hatred disappears. Until all envy and jealous and petty thoughts are blown away, as the wind blows the mists from the valley. I was weak, but now you've made me strong. I was proud, but now I shall be humble. I was filled with bad thoughts, but now they shall be gone forever, as a youth leaves the ways of childhood, and becomes a man. ♪ Come, let us be brothers ♪ Come, let us be friends ♪ Take me away from the sadness inside ♪ Make all my loneliness end ♪ Come, let us be brothers ♪ Come, let us be friends ♪ I have forgotten how happiness feels ♪ Won't you please show me again ♪ Brother bear, la la la la ♪ Brother bear, la la la la ♪ Brother bear, la la la la ♪ Brother bear, la la la la ♪ I am a child, la la la la ♪ Again with you ♪ Starbird and Sweet William ♪ Sounds so soothing to me ♪ Out of an emptiness too deep to tell ♪ Find me a reason to be ♪ Starbird and Sweet William ♪ Sounds so soothing to me ♪ Out of the darkness and into the sun ♪ Finally I'm able to see ♪ Brother bear, la la la la ♪ Brother bear, la la la la ♪ Brother bear, la la la la ♪ Brother bear, la la la la ♪ I am a child, la la la la ♪ Again with you
