'ORIDATHU' I didn't think it would happen so often. - Didn't you? Luckily, nothing went wrong. What can we do? - How much does this cost? No matter what we go to buy.. - Even if we stay.. Do you want tea? - Yes. What do you want to eat? - He is not on the right path. Add it to my account. - We will go tomorrow. Will he come? - He will surely come. Here's your tea. Do you need anything else? There's an adage that says 'if the procession is bad, then the festival shall be great'. The people were saying that it wasn't up to the mark this year. Then the festival is going to be extraordinary. Hey, Raman! That sack is to be delivered at Killimangalam. Please stop. Stop the vehicle! 'With reference to your memorandum cited above' 'I am to inform you that the ex-engineer..' I'm sorry. 'The executive engineer of the department' 'will be visiting your village to carry out' 'a preliminary investigation of the feasibility' 'of the proposed electrification of the village.' 'The date and time of the said visit' 'will be intimated duly.' Raman! Where has he gone? Hey, Raman! - Sir. You can distribute it to everyone. - Okay. It's a good day, isn't it? Having Payasam would be a good idea. Yes, technological development has arrived in this small village of ours. In the better days to come we shall witness machines that work on electricity like fans, grinders and other appliances. Who said 'Humans are great species?' Marx. - Lenin. - Trotsky. Yes! Marx Lenin Trotsky! This isn't the votive from the temple, is it? It doesn't matter whether it's from the temple or the house it is all the same. Run.. What are you doing? - Hey.. Run, Ramu. - Hey, stop him. You can start running now. We will play after a while. - Go slowly.. Stop him.. - Come on. Hey, catch him. - Hey, Krishna! Run! Watch it. Catch me if you can. Come on. - Catch him. It's my turn now. Catch him! Not over there, but here. Hey.. - Give it a try. Catch hold of his leg. I win! - He won. Did you hear, Thomachan? - What? They don't even know what starvation means. Oh, I see. Son, it's time for me to go and collect funds. Close the shop and go home. I know very well about your collection. Make sure that he reaches home if he gets too drunk. - Okay. Did you hear, Josekutty? The engineer is coming here. Our village is going to be enlivened by the lights of development. 'Light is sadness, oh, dear! Darkness is more comforting.' Haven't you heard it, Mr. Shekharan? From where did you learn that? Let me hear the rest. You are such a dissuader! Two tea, please. Come. What about the electricity? Finally, we got a reply to the memorandum we submitted. Will it make any difference? We cannot expect more from a capitalist government like ours. 'An informal meeting' 'may be conducted.' 'Today, the trustful..' What's the news? "The time when the leaves fall." People are excited about getting electricity. We should get it as well, right? Yes. Even if it's expensive, we can't neglect it. I will try. - Okay. Come on! Come! Come! Fast! Good morning, everybody! - Please come. Did your have a pleasant journey? - Yes! You can have some rest. What would you like to drink? - No, I just had breakfast. I don't want anything now. - What about some buttermilk? It will be a relief in this weather. Raman! - Yes! - You are here! Bring some buttermilk for the engineer. Let's go inside. What's your name? - Joseph John. Where are you from? - Kozhencherry, near Chengannur. Hello. - Hello. He came here from Brazil to study about the oracles. His name is Antonio. He is staying here. I have put some conditions, like he should bathe daily and wear traditional underwear. He was very happy. I must admit the dedication of these westerners. Engineer, this is the junction that I have told you about. - I see. We need a post there. A street lamp as well! That's the way to the Panchayat. And this way is to the temple. There should be street lamps near the temple. We will have to cut these trees. - Why not! We will cut them. You should install a lamp there as well. Where? - Near the Harijan colony. Be careful! Look out for that banyan root! Yes, like that! We are going to electrify this village. I welcome Mr. Joseph John, the engineer who is in-charge of this project. I use this opportunity to request you all to be a helping hand to him and his fellow subordinates. Now, Mr. Joseph John will share a few words with you. Respected President, Mr. Nampoothirippadu and friends. This village is going to get electricity. 'Electricity is not a symbol but a catalytic agent for change.' You might have heard this saying before. I request you all to make this project a big success by giving accurate details to the government. Why are you back so early? - We don't have class today. A riot has broken out somewhere. I don't know where it is. I understood. It's in support of the Goa Liberation Movement. The master told me yesterday. - Where are you going? To the shop. Where else would I go? Neela, can you give me the knife? - Why do you need it, master? I need it. Here. You can take this. Is it enough? - Yes. Jose! Jose! Jose! Jose, the weekly edition has arrived. It's a Christmas special edition. 'Neelakuzhil' Give me one! Give me one.. Give it to me.. Shall we get down? - Yes, this is the place. Get down. - Hold this. Unchain it. - Place them here. The other side. Unchain it. - I'm on it. Yes. Unload it slowly.. Watch it.. That's it. Run.. - Is it heavy? - Yes. 'Smoking is injurious to health.' Move back.. - Go away! Put it there. Hey, move back! Go home! You've become a nuisance! Hey, won't you let us work? They're fragile. Unload them carefully. Move back! - What are you doing? Go away.. Move aside. What is this? Go home.. You'll hurt yourself. Go back! You've become a nuisance. Hurry up. Go home.. This way.. - Roll it. Go away! Hey, go to your houses. Careful.. I have a friend named Tharun in Kolkata. I have told you about his article in the newspaper. Yes. - 'Pather Panchali'. This week's edition has it. I haven't seen you of late. I'm busy these days. I'm at my father's shop most of the time. If you really want to see the use of electricity you must witness the festival in Thrissur. - Is it? - Oh, God. In the Soviet Union, there isn't a single house without electricity. When a baby is born in a house the government makes sure that the required electricity for the baby is delivered to that house. - Oh, I see. Which is the way to Manakkal? - It's that way. Achuthan Nair. - Yes. Take them with you when you leave. - Okay. I wonder if they have electricity with them. - Fool! I'm the manager at Manakkal house. He'll take you there. - Thanks. - It's all right. Lift. Once again. Step your foot there. That's it. Hold the chain. Move to the front and sit over there.. Move forward. Put your legs between those ropes. Don't worry. Take these now. You can hop on it now. Get on him. Lift your leg. Hold the tail. That's it. Don't worry. You can sit on it. Take this too. Hurry up. What are you doing? Walk! Come on.. Move towards the right. How do we get down now? Give them to me. You don't have to worry. You won't fall. Get down the same way you climbed. Step on her leg and get down. Come here.. Is Mr. Nampoothirippadu here? - Yes, I'll call him. Come here. Turn around. Move to your left. That's it. We're from Puthumaadam's shop. We didn't have the stock. We arranged it from another place as you were our client. - Okay. We've brought the sample. How would the business thrive if Namburars run it? You can rest for a while once you're done with the lunch. Today is Thursday, isn't it? It's inauspicious until 3 p.m. You can start after that. They've begun preparations at Manakkal to electrify the house. Dad, we should also get a connection. I received a letter from Bhaskaran. What does it say? He says he'll bring radio, fan and other things when he comes here for his vacation. - Okay. I'll try to talk to them about electrifying our house. If the master were alive, he would've got our house electrified. You don't know anything. What is it? I have lost everything. Master. Are you listening? Yes. What a pity! What can I say? You haven't had anything. - I have had enough. I normally eat less for supper. A glass of milk is enough for me. What can I do, master? I have to live for the sake of Josekutty. Do you want some? - No, Thomachan. I don't drink. No. - Okay. Right after Maria's death, her husband left her. Why are you saying all this now? I'm an unlucky man. So unlucky! "Oh, Infant Jesus, who was born in the stable!" "I see your divine image." "We shall rest upon you." "Please bless us. Oh, Lord!" "Lord, You have been so faithful." "Oh, we're here to know the power of your resurrection!" "And to know you in your agonies." "We've come here to worship you." "As we call your name, will you meet us here?" "And praise the holy name." "To feel the bliss of your embrace." "You're my rock, in times of danger." "Oh, Infant Jesus! Who was born in the stable." "I see your divine image." "We shall rest upon you." "Please bless us. Oh, Lord!" "Oh, Infant Jesus, who was born in the stable!" "I see your divine image." "We shall rest upon you." "Please bless us. Oh, Lord!" "Oh, Infant Jesus, who was born in the stable!" "I see your divine image." "We shall rest upon you." "Please bless us. Oh, Lord!" "Oh, Infant Jesus, who was born in the stable!" "I see your divine image." "We shall rest upon you." The day I met Maria.. I was there in the carolling group. She was very beautiful. Angel.. Like an angel! "Oh, my dear!" "Oh, beauty!" "Let it match if it's meant to be." "Let's wait till Onam." "Oh, my dear!" "Oh, beauty!" "Let it match if it's meant to be." What are you waiting for? Unload it fast. We need to load the remaining goods as well. Be careful! Sir. Kuttan. - Okay. Make it fast. The truck will be here soon. Why are you so slow? Make it fast. What happened, Jose? Did you get an electric shock? What happened? It's not matching. We will go with the quarter. Are you finished? - Yes, sir. Is this lamp good? - Yes, sir. Four coconut trees have been cut down from Thekkeppattu. Mr. Pothuval made a living with those trees. Either electricity or the trees! We should cut the trees if we want electricity. - It's not that. If the lines were about to the East the Manakkal family might lose their jackfruit tree. That's all! - We got the electricity because of Nampoothirippadu. Don't forget that. You are so loyal to them. You will surely learn a lesson in the long run. The officer should find a way. - That's right. We will now know who he supports. Hey, come over here. Okay, then. What were they saying? - They're fighting with each other. Why? - Nuisance! They are so irritating! To hell with them! Who do they think they are? - But we should listen to them. Hold it. Won't women come to work if you ask them to? For the project work. - I will try. Okay. We will give them the same wage imposed by the government. Here. I don't want it now, sir. The engineer told me as he is close to me. We are lucky. Even if you refuse the offer, they could take her away. It's a government matter. Could you bring me something to drink? Push it.. - That side.. Step on it.. - Step on it. Push it. - Raise it. - That's it. Pull the rope.. - Don't let go. Hold tight.. - That's it.. That's right. Put gravel over here. - Give him the shovel. Bring it - Now place the rocks. - Get the rocks. Push them with your feet. - Place it right. Watch your legs. Be careful. You might slip. Watch it. Let it go.. Let go of the rope. Drop it. Tie it properly. Pull it now. Hey, Nair. Don't you dare say anything! Make sure that it doesn't fall on the post. Watch it. Chop the branches leaning towards the road. - Okay. Move the wires aside. - Move the wires. Take them away. Hey, Kuttan. - Yes. - Watch and learn. - Yes, sir. Is it the neutral wire? - Yes. Kuttan, get that. Tie it. Here. Untie it. Pull it. Is it enough? Pull it! - Pull it.. Here.. Hold it. Slowly. - Okay. Tie it now. Move. Walk straight. - Make sure that the wires aren't entangled. Twist it. - Pull it. - Come on. Move. Unwind it. Somebody unwind it and help them. - Faster.. What is he doing? Pull them tightly. - I'm doing it. Unwind it.. Walk straight. - Come. Walk. 'Mathrubhumi' Some believe that anything is possible if they can influence the officer. I won't let them chop even a branch from my plot. Nobody needs your permission to do that. I shall also talk with that overseer. You shouldn't take such foolish decisions without thinking. For the betterment of the people we may have to compromise on some matters. The overseer is a smart guy. Kathakali, drama, and music. He told me a plan for the electrification of our library. Drama for the festival. Everything can be sorted out with the donation fund it seems. I don't think it's time for our library to be electrified yet. Old books which preach superstitions novels which support capitalism and poems on love. Then, I think it must be the temple that must be electrified before this library. We can hear the vedic hymns in the morning and evening over there. How about that? I strongly oppose such thoughts. I have no part in this. I think we must propose a street light in front Kunjilakshmi's house. People who visit her at night wouldn't trip and fall anymore. Hey, I'll.. What did you do? I'll kill you today. Oh, no! - What's happening.. - Let go of him.. He brought down my newly built compound for the sake of the post. I'll kill him.. - Forget it, Raghavan. What could he do about it? He was just following orders. We must fight against the landlords who oppose such actions. That's the right thing to do. Tighten it. Tighten it well. Pull it.. - That's it.. Tie it now. - Let go. Pull it. - Loosen it a bit. Let it go from there! Yes, some more. Pull. You just have to unwind it. - I'm doing it.. Leave it now. - The wires are all entangled. Do it properly. - Pull it up now. What is it? Do it carefully. The wires are all twisted. Let it go, sir. - Pull it. This was not needed. - You've misunderstood us. We are poor! What is this, Dad? - Let go! - I said come with me! Let go of me.. - Come, Dad. Thomachan, you're fighting for no reason. - Dad.. Please stop. I did it for you.. - Let me tell you one thing. You'll be getting the power supply over my dead body. Come, Dad. What are you doing? - Go in, Dad. What are you doing? Get inside. Keep quiet, Dad. It's all right. He'll forget it by tomorrow. Come. What is this, Dad? Stop it! - Oh, Jesus! Jose.. Jose! Get inside! They're rich people. We didn't have to get the power connection at all. "In enchanting blossoms" "and vibrant butterflies." "We see your wonderful creations." "May our heart be filled with noble deeds." "We pursue you in our path." "We feel his blessings in the rays of the sun." "Praise the Lord who lives in the realm of our thoughts." "Oh, God, rising above this world." Come, enough! Go. Please sit. Sir! I invite the honourable MLA to inaugurate this great project which was the dream of our village. Dear natives. I would say that it is because of my hard work that the government has approved for this project. The second five-year plan has started. By this time we all know that electricity is important for the development of a village. As our Chief Minister is guiding us to a united Kerala I wish technological.. I wish the technological development.. Will guide you to new heights. And I'm going to inaugurate this project. Down! "The rice and platter!" "If we are united.. - We can bring down the mountain." "If we are united.. - We can bring down the mountain." "The pot and the water." "The pot and the water." "The rice and platter!" "The rice and platter!" "If we are united.. - We can bring down the mountain." "If we are united.. - We can bring down the mountain." "If we are united.. - We can bring down the mountain." "The pot and the water." "The pot and the water." The inauguration was very grand. - So, you came! You are adding less milk in the tea at night, right? Thanks to the electricity, we caught you red-handed! How do you do? It's so bright! To hell with you, Nair! Give me the matchbox. Be careful! - Move! - It's dangerous! We will find a way. - Stay there! - Careful! 'The game of life' 'is ruining the social life of people.' 'From the hearts of people' 'the game of life and hatred should be detached.' 'And it should be replaced' 'with cooperation and compassion.' 'Those are the ideals of our institution.' 'What you heard right now was the speech by Mr. Sreekandan Pothuval' 'about the Village Development Institution.' 'All India Radio, Kozhikode.' Hello! We will see in the evening. I'm a bit busy right now. Okay, then. - Thank you. A special tea! Who was that? - Dr. Rajasekharan. He is a reputed surgeon. What's he doing here? - He's planning to stay here. He can manage his operations as there is electricity here. Because of the electricity, our luck has changed. The power went off! Damn it. It's been a while since I have been seeing him here. I saw him a couple of times talking to a thing in his bag. It might be some wireless device. I doubt that he is a CID officer. Yes, you're right. It has a gemstone in it. The price will be a bit high. - That's okay. Do you like it? From where did you get the money for all this? It's a secret. The meaning is that deep inside all of us, there is an artist. Singers, painters.. Why can't we make use of our talent than wasting our time? What do you think? - That's right! If you stand by me, we can prepare a drama that can even beat the plays from KPAC. How is it? - Okay.. Hey, Kuttan. Why are you so haughty these days? Why are you always with him? He is a doctor. - Oh! Yes, right! He might be a fraud. The arrack we get here is of poor quality.. It is bad. Do you have good arrack? - I did not buy it for selling. I bought it for us to drink. Bananas, jackfruit and mangoes. Oh, so.. It is the elephant owned by Manakkal family. Whatever it is, it's an elephant. Stay here. You don't have to be scared. - I am not scared. Shall I get you one more? Yes. Where have you kept it? I have buried it in the farm. It's special. - Okay. What is your name? - What? Your name. What is your name? Panchami. He will come now. What is your name? - Madhavi. What is your age? - What? Your age. - I am 75 years old. What is your problem? I am not feeling well. I am not able to walk. I am sick, that is it. Okay, turn around. Come on. Take a deep breath. Once more, please. Once more. Run.. - Run.. Run.. - Run.. Poor crow. Come fast.. - Look at that.. Did you see that? It is okay. I saw a spark in the electric line near the river. Haji's goat and its two kids died on getting an electric shock. Even an elephant will get killed if they come in contact with those huge structures bringing current to this place. I cannot believe such a danger was hiding in plain sight. Oh, God! Is this the reason why doctors say that ice is hot? Might be. Might be. Destiny is dragging us.. - "My neighbour.." "That is all.." From the same mountain.. - "Inside me.." "Inside me.." - What is this, sir? - What? From the same mountain.. - Same.. It originated from the same mountain.. - Okay.. It originated from the same mountain.. And followed the same path.. - And followed the same path.. Those love birds.. - "Shaking.." "In your beauty.." - In the destiny of.. Without any way.. - "Unpredictable.." "You are the ocean.." - From the same mountain.. Originated and through the same path. - "The beauty.." Those love birds.. - "In that circle.." The destiny.. - "The beauty.." It started from the same mountain.. - "Inside me.." Those love birds.. - "Shaking.." And followed the same path.. The mountain which is the destiny.. The destiny.. - "The shaking beauty.." The same path.. - Wait, let me say. It started from the same mountain and followed the same path. - "I..' Are you on your way back? - Yes. Where are you now? - Pathankot. Get my belongings out. - Okay. Slowly. That too. - Okay. And that fan. Carefully. How are you? Are you fine, Neela? - Yes. Are you on your way back? - Yes. Is her marriage fixed? - No. Our village has changed. Did you see those electric lines? Do you still have your old job? Making arrack and small thefts! No, sir. If you do such stuff when I am around I will not spare you. Mom, dad is home.. How are you, dear? Are your exams over? - Yes. Mom, dad is home. Please hold this carefully. You have become so big. Why did the bus come so early, today? I was about to go to the bus stop. Then, I heard the horn of the bus. Was the journey comfortable? - Yes. How long is your vacation? - Two months. Do you have to go back to Pathankot itself? - Yes. Most probably. Please take that. Wow, it looks good. Yes, it's nice. Liquor for dad. Balloon for you, dear. - Any promotion.. I might get.. - What is all this? Take that. This is for you, Dad. You can use it in winter. You can take this. - Come. - Okay. This is for you. What is he doing? Come here, dear. This is for you. Blow it. Oh, no. - Keep blowing. Don't do it, dear. Oh, no. How is it? Doctor. Oh, was it you? Do you know any of those girls? Oh, they are the Manakkal's manager's kids. The elder one is married to an army man. What is it? He is back in town. Where are you now? - Pathankot. No matter where he is, he'll never miss the festival. I heard that the girls in Kashmir have cheeks as red as this apple. Is it true? Your name is Devi, isn't it? I'm a devotee too. Will you give me some of that oblations? Oh, why are you back? - Keep quiet. Who is drawing in this, Jose? I don't know. It's beautiful. Take a look at it. What is it, Jose? What happened to you? I managed to find a job in Bangalore. It's in a book stall. I can continue to study while I'm working there. But my father is not letting me go. I'll talk to my dad about this. You father will listen to my dad for sure. But they don't talk to each other. I'll take care of that. There is a proposal for Devaki. It's the doctor. He is from the South. I can't remember where he was from. It's Kaduthuruthy. Yes. He saw her once and came here with the proposal. Is it? These days it doesn't matter where he is from. If he likes her, then we should proceed with the wedding. It would be great if we can conduct the wedding before you return. What are you doing? Oh, no. What is it? I think you are becoming naughtier these days. Through the rough tides. In the snow clad mountains. When I was standing face to face with death. I was thinking about you, dear. It was only you. - Dear.. The birds which came from the same mountain. Those birds.. - Because of destiny. Because of the destiny. - They are wandering off. They are wandering off. Yes, dear. But.. - Yes, dear. What about the graves? Dear, even the graves have.. No.. Look at him when you are talking. Yes, dear Okay. - Even the graves have their own value, right, dear? - Okay. Yes, it has a value, dear. It has. But are you telling me the truth? Don't doubt me, dear. Don't.. - No. - Don't doubt me, dear. Don't doubt me, dear. - Okay. - Don't doubt me, dear. Oh, my dear. My dear. - My dear. - It's your turn to go in. Who is it there? - Fear.. You should have fear on your face. Oh, we forgot. - Oh. - You shouldn't hug her when her dad walks in, right? Let's start again. My dear. - My dear. - Okay. Now the father can go in. - Who is it? The engineer had told me that he will get me a job. If I get a job. The first thing will be our wedding. Okay. Okay. We wish to have the wedding before Bhaskaran goes back. - Oh, I see. We'll talk to your relatives and let them come here too. I don't have any close relatives. I have a sister, but she is in Ethiopia. And the rest of them will not stand against me. What is your full name? Rajasekharan. Rajasekharan Pillai. But we don't use the caste as our second name. Have you heard of Mannathu Padmanabhan? And then there is Vaikom Velappan and M.P. Manmadhan. You didn't eat anything. Maybe some other time. Okay then, I'll leave. The patients will be waiting. It's a busy day. We need four bangles of her size two sovereigns of gold chain and a nuptial chain also. Did you find a groom for her? Yes, there was a proposal from the doctor. Yes. - He is marrying her. He saw her and liked her and came to us with a proposal. Poor thing. This cow was the only source of income for Malluamma. Yes. I heard a lot of disturbing noises last night. Even I heard something like that. Yes.. But I thought it was something else. I wonder if the cow's meat is poisonous as it was electrocuted. It is usually said that it won't stop with one. Don't say things like that. Oh, that's a good thing. What did your dad say, Jose? He is not letting me go. Okay, let me talk to him about it. He never spoke to me after that incident. You will be able to convince him. Yes, I'll try to talk to him. Don't let him play. Don't worry about it. - Take it. It doesn't matter who is saying it. - How much is it? - It's Rs. 25. But we are against that idea. - Here. We have a much better support. I also agree with you on that, Shekharan. - Okay. Thomachan, you must be angry with me. Master, you are the one who should be mad at me for my stupidity. I have something important to talk to you. - Okay. Jose. Jose, I will be back soon. Okay, Father. Master, you are right. But please try to understand my concern I can't live separated from my son, Jose. That shop will be enough for him to make a living. Is that enough? He is good in academics. He wants to pursue higher studies. If he goes to Bangalore, he can study after his work. There is no provision for that over here. Then I will sell my shop. I will accompany him. I can't live without seeing my son. I can't. Thomachan, why are you crying like a kid? Look at me. Why are you so naive? The matter of fact is that the moods changed with new clothes. Isn't it? - That's correct. We are lucky Bhaskaran came. Or else, we couldn't hang out here. You can all go home and sleep. Tomorrow is the final rehearsal. - Okay. The script. - Okay. I will be back in a moment. It's new. The old man will fall asleep after he drinks this. Are you sure? Yes, I am sure. I'm leaving. - Okay. How are you? Did you see the rehearsals? What's your opinion? Don't feel bad when I tell you this. It's not up to the mark. They are just kids. Expect nothing more. Have you seen the play 'Parijathapushpadakaranam'? What? - You might not have seen it. The character of Sathyabhama was excellent. I was the one who played that character. "Dear, where does this fragrance come from?" "I have not smelled a fragrance so intoxicating ever before." Do you feel sleepy? - What? Do you feel sleepy? I won't feel sleepy if I'm drunk. That's my habit. "Dear, where does this fragrance come from?" "I have not smelled a fragrance so intoxicating ever before." "Dear, where does this fragrance come from?" "I have not smelled a fragrance so intoxicating ever before." "Dear, where does this fragrance come from?" "I have not smelled a fragrance so intoxicating ever before." Malu.. Malu.. Don't cry. We will find a way. Let's go and see the doctor. No, I won't do it. Let's elope to some place. Okay, before we go let's see that doctor. Let's find out if you can travel. Look at me.. Believe me. Oh, was it you? We want to see you. - Come in. What is the matter? Are you pregnant? Go inside. Go on. Oh, no! Please don't! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Stop! Oh, no. Like the fireworks. Maybe ten times more powerful. 'The minister committed suicide' 'in a chamber in his house.' There were dead bodies everywhere. We'll have some drinks and we'll be there.. - Corpse. Corpse.. There is a corpse in the pond. How can there be a dead body in the pond? It must be some cloth floating in it. - Yes. Do you know who it is? Are you sure that you saw a corpse? I am sure I saw it. Let's go and check it out. Oh, no. What? - What happened? What happened? - Bring me some water. What happened to you? I felt like I was about to faint. Is it Malu? - Yes.. She must have been electrocuted. The pond is not clean anymore. Move away. Move away. - Move. Be careful. It's dangerous if the electric wires touch the water. Move away. - Lay her down there. Something is wrong with this place. We have lost the friendship among us. The birds and animals are dying every day. And now there was a dead body in the pond. Everything is happening while we are planning for the festival in the temple. Don't worry about it. Let's call an astrologer. Human kind is in the scientific era. Yes, now the human kind is playing with the world. In a time like this I'm against anarchy and superstition. What are we going to do now? Can you explain the legal side of this situation? You are a lucky man. For the doctor to come here and to meet your daughter. He wants to keep it simple it seems. We have to plan the wedding before Bhaskaran goes back. - Don't cry, come here. Why can't you let me be in peace! Don't make me beat you. Go and sit down over there. How much is it for the 'Sughiyan'? It's not 'Sughiyan', it's 'Mothakam'. Do you want one? Give me a black tea with that. Do you know someone named Rajappan? Rajappan. There is no one here with that name. It must be someone in the electricity board. I heard that there is a new mahout for Ganesh. By the way, who are you? I'm coming from the south. Rajappan is my husband. I heard that he is somewhere here. What is his job? He was a working as a peon in a hospital. He is short and fat. Maybe the doctor will know him. That's right. Hey, Appu go and show them the doctor's house. I'm also going that way. Come. What are you looking at? Are you trying to scare me? If I want I can put you in prison right now. I know how that girl died. Don't underestimate me. That one. Okay. I'll pay later. This mango is delicious. The next plenum has been scheduled. What is that? Did you know that there is a funeral? "Oh, Goddess Kali, where were you born?" "Oh, Goddess Kali, where were you born?" "Oh, Goddess Kali was born there." "Oh, Goddess Kali, where were you born?" "She is coming from the sky." "The earth will break open." "She was standing near the door in the west." "She is going from there too." "With intensity in her eyes" "The skies split upon her gaze." "She is going from there too." Do you want to shave your moustache? It's just hair, it'll grow back, right? - Yes. I'm dressing up as a Nambudiri for the drama. Hey! Dad agreed to it, Rama. He agreed because the master had a talk with him. When do you have to go? - As soon as possible. I wish to leave soon after the festival. Rama, when you come to watch the drama wear that blue blouse, plaid your hair on both sides and wear studs.. - Don't be silly, Jose. Will you come? Won't you come? Oh, no.. - Leave him! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh.. Oh, no! Fire.. Fire.. Fire.. Fire..
