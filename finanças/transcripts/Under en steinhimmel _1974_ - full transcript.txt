Teamfilm AS, Lenfilm Studio OCTOBER, 1944 Already in early summer 1944, people in East Finnmark began to move into the mines at Bjørnvatn. The order of the Nazis was ready: the entire country was to be destroyed and all people forced southward. But it was not so. By October, the mountain was populated by two to three thousand people, women, children & elderly for the most part. Inside they had created their own little community, independent of the German superpower outside. But soon a reputation begins to spread, that the mountain is going to burst. This film is about one such episode. The film was co-produced by Norway and the USSR UNDER A STONE SKY Screenplay SIGBJÖRN HJOLMEBAKK, JURIJ NAGIBIN Production SVEN TUREG, VLADIMIR SEMENEC Sound ASJA ZVEREVA State Film Symphonic orchestra of the USSR, led by E. CHACATURJAN Main cameraman VLADIMIR VASILJEV Main Architect ISAAK KAPLAN Directed by KNUT ANDERSEN, IGOR MASLENNIKOV Did you give the residents an evacuation order? - Yes, Colonel, but... Are there still residents in the area? We do not have enough technical means, Colonel. Your troops have taken everything! Do you see, Mr. Mere? We've evacuated so many times, and on foot! - It's cold, it can end up tragically. - Please? - Nothing. The Fuhrer issued an order to keep Northern Norway at all costs. One thing is commands, the other the harsh reality of war. If the worst happens, there must be nothing left for the Bolsheviks to use. Neither men nor animals, a single house, a barn, or a haystack! Not a single pair of skis! Look again! - What is he saying? - It's his brother. - This is Hjalmar! - Look, I'll look. Places! We are emerging! The Major relies on you. - If you're going for the first time, I believe everything will come out. - It's going! - Hold on, Losh! - Unfortunately! - Ticho, Tino! Enough. - What happened? Eldar? - What do I see? - Utopence. - You're alive? - Of course! And you knew that? Why didn't you say anything? - I couldn't! - You could tell us. So much trouble! How is it with them? Something happened? - Matka is in the hospital, in Kirkenes. - The father is with her. - Heart! - List with Vasiliev. - Oh my God! You still have drawn a Russian! - Hello. - Or are you a Norwegian? Russian. I want to go here. - Welcome to us! - Thank you. You have peace here, silence. Fast! Marto, upstairs! Silence, Timo! - What do you want? - Buy fish! - We went to sleep. - When Wehrmacht leaves, you'll go bankrupt. We need fish. You give me the tobacco. Three pawls. - Two pawls. - Three. Two are enough. Two, three! That was a dashing resistance! I have to change the bushes. Bring the shooter. - Hjalmar... What is it? - Little girl! - And what is his name? - Nothing. Where do you have a family? - In Leningrad. - Leningrad? - Not too hot? - I'm called Naďa. - No? And my brother is called Zena. - What parents? - Thanks, thank you! - I have to see my mother! - No! - Is in hospital. - I'm going with Hjalmar to Kirkenes. No! Will you come with me! Is right. You have to go with him. - But I'll be back soon. - No. - New! - You didn't forget? First of all, reports on minefields at Holmengofjord and Bek Bay. Sure, as we have agreed. That's right. I have not seen my family for three years. Command of Prime Minister Quisling. The inhabitants of Norway are obliged to unconditionally submit themselves. Their goal is to save the Norwegian inhabitants before the tyrannical Bolsheviks. The inhabitants of Kirkenes, we command you to assemble today at 19:00 in the harbour, at the steamboat Tangvik. Everyone is allowed to take their luggage with them up to 15 kilograms and meals for three days. Later, boarding will be provided. Those who do not complete the command, will be handed over to the German military tribunal. I repeat. The inhabitants of Kirkenes! We command you to assemble today... My rabbit! Stop! Thank you! Kams wanted to go? He caught him. - Are you sure the train will go? - Yes! Stroke is our man. So you decided to go to the mine? Under the mountains is it more promising than underwater Sofi? You know who his brother-in-law is. More! Nazi! Hold your tongue! - Was he here? - Yes! He was with us yesterday. - Have you heard what they were talking about? - Of course. They argued. The Minister sent Quisling a telegram, not to issue food tickets here. They want to force people to go south. - And your man does not want that? - He doesn't know what he wants. She wants you to go with the kids, don't you think? They are not going anywhere. I know better than your man, as it is dangerous at sea. - And what if they come? - Russ? You have nothing to worry about! No! We are also a family, like mum and dad. - How's my mother? - Poor. Mainly, if she kept moving... - Move? What do you mean? - They're in the shaft. Both of them. - The nurse is empty. - In the shaft? He will not live long. He's just talking about Eldar. He doesn't believe he will died. He thinks he's alive and he'll be back when he'll free us. So far we know that he is with us. But what about us? They reported that it would be windy at sea. Those who throw up over the deck are disgusting and look like the Nazis. - There's a place. - Thanks! Peace be with you. - That's a terrible smell. - You like that? Maybe we'll go. When does the steamer leave? Once it's over. You will be a true patriot. German patriot! Good German mattress. There's a train there. Is there anyone who thinks that he will go with him? Is not it? Good! Because you know the order. The German Commander kindly provided a steamer. Good steamer available to residents. - Trosek! - What? And what if we refuse? So the Bolshevik terror will be waiting for you... Those who refuse will see how the iron wall rises between you and... What the hell do you have in that bag? Come here! A rabbit! You are like those cowardly rabbits, who would have given up. What about you? If you want to work with your dick anyway, wait for the Bolsheviks and see. They'll just put your bullets in your back and your eyes... - I know what I'm talking about. - I see. It is true! - Who is it? - Hey, what are you doing? Heroic Hunting Regiment of the 2nd Mountain Division. - I have to leave! - But it isn't possible now. Kirkenes is just one town and they need me in Hammerfest. - I assume that... - Stay here. Before you were thinking of what? Taking control of Kirkenes and its surroundings. But Mr. Minister... You know the instructions and you know how to follow them. I'm sure you can do it like me. You are the person who knows it here. Good luck. - Thank you, Minister. Heil Hitler. - Sieg heil! Astrid, you are crazy. The steamer is leaving in a while. Where are you, Astrid? Stop! That's sabotage! - Daddy! Dad! - Astrid? - Dad, are you with us? - Astrid, you didn't. The Germans shoot everyone who... Astrid, please! Yeah, somebody is going, someone is leaving, and someone is standing in the same damn place. Like you, Mere. You don't know who you are. What do you want? Wait. No, not like that. That was right. Not this way, look. I dance like that. - I thought the Russians were dancing well. - Good dancing. Hjalmar is where? He's late, your brother. After a while we have to make a connection, and now here. A lot of people, gentlemen! I didn't know there was a rail road here. But no, it's just factory. - The station is just one, shaft. - Shaft? - Yes. Sven? You don't recognise me? Is that you, Ellinur? I thought you moved to Vadsa. I came back. I took a boat from Kirkenes! And where is your husband? The Germans killed him in Kibergu! Brown! Brown! I'm going gold! Come on! - What about your parents? - They drove them south. Do you need some help? Shall I bring you water? Help the woman rather, and then come back. Just half. You are here today for the third time. Shall we remove the dirt? - Mere's wife came in! - Seriously? - This is probably more. - She is not a Nazi. - Has anyone already seen her? - I haven't. She arrived yesterday with her children. Her mother is in a hospital, apparently dying. Kirkenes, that's a nice name. That means the church was first build here, right? Yes, it's right... Soon that church will be the only remaining thing here. I hope it will be spared at least. We don't burn churches. - You know why? - No! Don't think that is for some religious reasons, from practical point of views. I'll explain it to you. Imagine, the houses were burned, the inhabitants had fled to the mountains, and after some weeks, when they are no longer entertained in dwellings or huts, they would want to come home. And so they would gather in the church. They want to hide, right? And at that moment we'll send out a disciplinary unit. The church becomes a trap. By the way, Mr. Mere, how many people will fit into the church? - And two hundred. - And into a shaft? I want to go home! We're all here together and we'll be with you! He is not the youngest. My children! I was quiet when I put you in bed. And it's not that long ago. And now I'm here... Hjalmar, did you want to see a doctor? - Yes, where is he? - Come with me. Inside the mountain there are huge warehouses, supplies for the entire German army on the Northern Front. - Nobody has ever been there before. - No one has ever tried it. We still have food and there are more important things to do. We have to think properly. Ninth. She was born at night. Milk is enough, but if we want meat, we will have to kill cows. This is already a problem. First try to get into the warehouse. We have Rickard, he goes through any door. It's a difficult task. We're becoming more and more. - They are here? - You came yesterday. They're waiting! - Come with me. - I have something for them. - Phenomena! I'll be with you soon! Good! These are the figure on the minefields in the fjords. In addition, the Germans withdrew their troops from Torne. Looks like they're expecting an attack from there. Does it look bad with your mother? It looks bad for all. We're trapped. If the Germans go from words to acts, it is all over! That's terrible! Look, there were ours! Did you see that? They burned them alive. Swine! There were people here, and now they're just a bunch of corpses. They burned the prisoners, animals! They say they have driven out thousands of ours to forced labour! State! Attention! What are you doing? Damn! You wanted to kill the prisoner? A good fascist is a dead fascist. They burned our people. How does that make you any better than them? They will judge you for this! I have to take Martha and the baby, or burn the house. You see what they are capable of. They burned almost the entire town. - Give Marta! - Thanks! - How can we like him? Don't complain. - He speaks Norwegian well! - He studied at the university. Let's do it, they don't bury the mine! There are no Germans there, and there are thousands of Norwegians! Good! Father gave us a circus with his brother. We managed until the war began. And now the Germans caught us. All nine of us were sent to a camp. Father and brother perished. And I ran away. Over the queue. Lieutenant, you have to go to the regimental commander. If they judge me, I'll tell them about this camp! How my dad and brother died. What I learned from this. I'll tell them what a pig is and why I throw knives! - Grigorija Ivanova. - Yes. - Give others a meal, a bit of alcohol, as in the regulations. - What? Has it already started? - Looks like it. And the water is pretty cold in Jarfjord! What's up here like a pant. Get up! It's not time to put you in court. You buy the blood. - You should play the songs. - Something was wrong. Oh, my God, here's the Christmas glass! - Rickard, where are you? - Here! - You got food? - And you? - Jenom detonator. - If the Germans blow the store in the air, it will be a disaster! No doubt! You see, it's written "Achtung" here. We have to be careful. - There's Rickard! - I have tasted such a good wine. How did you get there? I will show it to you! Will we get some wine? You're crazy! No word to anyone. Ezine to grow nicely. Only the Pope. I wanted to ask, can I buy milk for the kids? Buy? Your money is nothing to me. Go to the Germans! Did she do something to you? Or did her kids do something wrong? - No, but her husband did. - Because he's a jerk! I'm sorry. - There's a little... It is enough for you? - Thank you! - We're neighbours now. - Looks like it. - It is nice! - How long have you been here? She hasn't dropped a drop for four weeks. - Milk arrived! - It's good. Sven, take a yellow jug from the shelf. Do you have a new employee? Guy, how to be. Thanks! Sven, help me blow my hair. No! Stop it! - When will you give birth? - I'm sorry to let us out of here. He will not wait for that long. - Thanks to you. - Give me a better piece. - I have to talk to my wife. - She doesn't want to see you. - Post me! - This isn't yours. - We do it without fascist. - You're trapped! - Get out. - Believe me! - What is he saying? I spoke to the commander. He said that... Stop panicking. Get out! - The Germans know you're here. - So what? I spoke to the commander. He said that... He didn't say that right... Wadni! What could I do? Do you want to talk to him? - They're coming from me. - Yes. Serjozo? Don't forget to build buckets and stumps. When the infantry starts to bleed, it will sink us all. We've seen cleaner things than yours. Cleaner! Better stop smoking, then it is cleaner. - Why not Dad? - Come on! Spi! - The roses will kill him. - Who told you that? - Kluci! - Not so. NSDP And you? Do you think it's true that the Germans are coming here? What would they do here? Did you hear him? He said we were trapped. I will take care of both of you. - Can I get to you? - No. - Eliner. - Yes? - Just sit on the edge of the bed. - No, no, no! Sven? - Dad, go, lie down. - I am not tired. Mark all floors. - Give the wire, fast! - Where's Eldar? - He returned. - I want to see him. - Thank you, mum. We will expel the Germans first. Guys, help! Fast! Your room is full of dust! - Hjalmar is here? - Yes, silently, please. - What happened? - Will you see them? - At ten o'clock at Jarfjord. - Good. He'll tell us we're on the brink of death. We'll take the boat! - Oh, you're staying here! - There's nothing for us here. - It's going to be hard. - I'm eating! - What if the fighting starts? - Do you want to sit here? - What are they? - You'll not understand, scum! - So what are they sending? - Who is crazy, he'll grow old soon. - How do you say? - Semon! Norway winks at you. And he tells you, I can't live without you, Semjone. It's time to take the sub-machine gun. Hjalmar's barn is a 20-minutes walk away. So. One thing is behind us. We're at Jarfjord! From Kirkenes? Me? And if, directly, it's about 25 kilometres... - Sergey Trofimovich? - There is a problem! We don't have enough ships! Yes, let's start! - Sergey Trofimovich! - We're going to start! What do you have? - The Norwegians there. - What do you mean "the Norwegians"? - They are fishermen. Fishermen? Where are they? Jarfjord, Jarfjord... So you are at Jarfjord? - Here! Come on, here. - Please. Sit down. They offer us our boats and say they will help us get there. I have to get your mother's greetings. You have to be careful. These were her last words. It is urgent! The Germans are about to blow up the mine. We have to help them. Where's your radio? In a reliable place, a few hours walk away. We're thinking about going to our father with the Russians. Go. And we'll go to the mine. Hey, Ruse, have coffee, have coffee? - What? - Coffee. - What do you have with the coffee. Get down, buddy! Comrade Lieutenant, I have an idea. We have a good resource for ice water in the Black Sea. Bring it here! Brown. Cocktail! Cocktail, and what is it? We have never heard of it? Cocktail? Maybe it's a healing coffee. The fishermen are not stupid. Brace yourself. Hold on! Come on, boys! I need help! The sub-machine gun... Put it here... closer... That's good, that's at least warmth. I said it. - Hold it. - Help... - Thanks. - Where do you have your kitten, Lieutenant? - Moved by my cat. Oh, come on. Boys, jump! Boys! They're here already. The Russians are here already. I will not stop them. I'm alone, Colonel. Hold your position! Heil Hitler. There must be nothing left. It's time to start destroying the food stores. Nothing can get into the hands of an enemy, neither archives, nor the ammunition! Everything must be destroyed! You can rely on me, Colonel. - Once you make the order! - What about women and children? According to the authorities they are all evacuated. The warehouses in the mountain need to be disposed of. - It's an order. - Yes, Colonel. - How many people did they say are there? - Around two thousands. - Yes, exactly. These two arrived specially to us. - So! And the dug-out is far away? - Moment! Once they have saved you, your division will have to break through the line of the queue. Comrade Colonel, this is Björne... - Björnevaten! - Björnevaten, yes! - Far, beyond Kirkenes? - It is far. You need someone local. We have one. That worked. It is harder for the partridge to cure. Hjalmar. You will be seventh. - Why do you go downstairs? - Why don't you go? I have claustrophobia since long time ago! I used to work in the mine before, and then it got to us there. Since that time, the disease from closed spaces has been in my head. Now no one will get me into the mine. But you go! Here are the warehouses inside the mountain. They lead from the main entrance of the hip line. As you can see, it's a labyrinth. This leads to the ammunition store, and this to the wine cellar. It's good wine! And that is cognac! The order is quite clear. Ksakra, where do you get here? You can't! There's my family. I want to see the Colonel. This is a mass murder. What do you know about mass murders. The Soviet Union, as well as Norway, is occupied by Germany. And Soviet troops come to Norway as allies. They have shown sympathy for our country. And we watch the hero with enthusiasm and the victorious struggle of the Soviet nation against a common enemy. The inhabitants of Northern Norway share the patriotic mood of the whole country. - Did you hear that the Russians... - Silence, the king is talking! The Norwegians are ready to bring the necessary sacrifices and show co-operation and discipline, which are necessary steps to victory. I send a warm greeting to the people in the north and I want to thank them for their hardness and patriotism. Together with the whole Norwegian nation I'm glad we can say with certainty, that the liberation of our country has begun. The final phase of the war may bring new victims and difficulties, but victory is closer every day. - I knew it! - Can't we drink to the king? So I'm going to drink to him too! They want to blow up the mine! Stop! Wait... By this lead, we'll get right down! Stay! Stop! There are people! I will show you! Attention! Vasiljeve... What's wrong with you, Ljosh? Colonel, stop! Peace. Keep quiet! Silence! We listen to what he wants to say! If we start panicking, everything will be lost! Don't lose your head! Put him down. We'll help him. Potapove? Peťo... Relax here. Do you hear? We'll be back soon. Wait here for us. Wait! How does it go? Everything ready, Colonel. Yes? So let's finish it. - Commander, Colonel. - He is hiding! The car is here. Come on! Fast! Say, Comrade Lieutenant, who doesn't like a fast ride in Russian? No? There are policeman on the road! Find out what happened. Surround them from above, from behind the mountain. Push! - Griso? - No? - Get the front of the mountain and cover me from the right. - And you, friend, left wing. - Wing? - Wing! Gypsy, where the hell are you going. The bullets missed him. Bless him! Excuse me? - There's no Germans here. - What? - There's one Russian. - Russian? Where? - He is in that wheelchair! - Push? He is a Russian! I see he is Rus! That's Ljos Vasiliev, an interpreter. We were together in Spitsbergen. And how come I see him here, and you speak Russian? We were in the intelligence here. That's why I couldn't find him. I have a letter for him. From whom... is the letter? Vida, he recovered. I'm the lieutenant, are you acquainted with me? The letter is from Leningrad, from home. So much for that letter. He told us he had a family in Leningrad. I know he's from Leningrad. Read... Please! Dear, Ljoso! Because of this damned fascism, your whole family has perished. Not even you mother or brother lives, not a house. Neighbour of Jerofeyev. Read, why don't you continue? It's unreadable. Put it here. Dear Ljoso, beloved son! - Mum? - Yes. We are all alive and well. And father? Father writes? Everything is alright. He fights. What about Zen? Listen, Ljosh! Everyone is doing well. They are alive! Is the dressing room here? What are you doing? Blowing it. Good colour for an important thing. - Thank you for everything. - Tell me when you get settled. Put it here! You have more important things to do! Emanuel! Catch! Dad, we are here! - What can I say? - What are you supposed to say now? When you get people into a new intelligence section, bring rookies to me. I will tell them this story. It will be useful for them. Nikolai. - We're out for an hour! - Yes! ORDER OF THE HIGH COMMANDER GENERAL MERECKOV.
