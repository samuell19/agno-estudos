I really enjoyed that movie. I love classics. Yeah, it was fascinating. The ending with the kids singing and dancing? That one kid playing the acoustic guitar? That was touching. Okay, you're right. I gotta learn the Portuguese language. Gotta be next on my things-to-do list. -You should teach me. -Got no problem with that. Think that's our Uber. Yep, that's him. How's your day? Good. I'm starvin'. I can call our order in. You want pizza? Sure. Hi, I'd like to order a large pan pizza with green peppers, spinach, and sausage for pickup. Thank you. Is everything okay? Everything is fine. -Are you sure? -Are you sure you don't want a slice of pizza? 'Cause you keep staring. Yes, no? We don't mind. Besides, Tyler mouth is much bigger than his stomach. What? Really? I know you ain't talkin', Mr. I-Could-Eat-A-Whole-Cow but really can only end up eating a small little mouse. Come on. Come here. Hey! Hey! Not that in my car! This makes no sense to me, this men kissing men stuff. It's not acceptable in my country! Good thing we're not in your country, are we? Why don't you just shut the hell up and drive? -Thank you. -Get out of my car! Look, we'll report you, you won't get paid, so I suggest you take us where we need to go. - I don't need your money! Get out! Get out! These boys... I am sick of you and your rainbow colors. -This guy got a bat? -What's-- what's he doin'? - He's walking over! - Get out of my car! - What's he about to do? - Get out! -What is he about to do? -Go, go, go! Stay behind me. This man is crazy! He's a bigot! No, no. No! No! No, no! No! No, no! Lola. I'm leavin'. Thank you, Your Honor. I rest my case. Mr. Eguasa, wake up. We don't have all day. -Uh... -Counsel, are you ready to give your closing statement? Yes I am, Your Honor. Your Honor, the State gives a compelling case. Attorney Matthews here... quite captivating, now, wasn't she? Yes, she was. Well, I'd like for your brilliant minds to consider this. In the case of... Okay. Uh, schedule her for tomorrow by 10:00. Awesome. Uh, thank you. Bye. Not now, Lola. Come on. - Not now. I didn't say anything! - Not now, okay? - What? Okay, what is it? She had you shook. Give her a few more years, and she's gonna be a beast to deal with in that DA office. Look, she wants to save the world by putting away the bad guys. No problem. Give her some time. Once she has a taste of Chicago's political culture, she's gonna come running to us for work. -You better hope so. -I know so. I don't ever wanna see you like that again. Remember who you are. You are David Eguasa. My father would've had a heart attack if he witnessed that. Yeah, I'm sure of it. But... your parents would be very excited to know that eventually, you'll make partner. - Amen to that. - Salud. Salud. What are we toasting to this time? Mmm. Another one of David courtroom victories. -Mm-hmm. -Although this time, he almost got thrashed. "Thrashed"? -Yes. -Interesting word. But I doubt it. My boy has the whole fashion history maker. You guys want another? -The usual? -Yeah, you know what? Give us your best bottle of Ciroc and put it on David's tab. Where's everyone at? Everyone except Sokal, 'cause that dude's supposed to be our friend. Every time he comes here, it's like he's asking for discount. Ah, Sokal is always late. And he's cheap. Sokal's cheap when it comes to supporting, but anytime we go anywhere else, he's happy to pay more. Crazy. Oh, here they go. -Hey! -Hey. Trina, we need a bigger table. Thanks. - Oh, my gosh. Another round after this! -I'm glad y'all having fun. -Mm-hmm. 'Cause I'm just gonna get right to it. Pay your bill. Tip the waiters. What are you talking about? Don't come at me like that. Nobody comin' at you like-- Pay your bill, tip the waiters. -How's the comedy club coming along? -Good. -When's the official open? -Soon. -So you're giving us free tickets? -Ah! Yes. I hate you, man. Like, what? How'd cheap-o over there get a beautiful Liberian queen like you? You're African royalty. - I know you have cousins. Oh... hook me up. Mmm. Well, you know what, I do have this one cousin. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm. And he, let me tell you-- He? Oh! Whoa! Oh, no. That's what you get! 'Cause we don't even talk like that. Now, we have thousands of languages and dialects. Which one are you pretending to do? The ones from Zamunda and Wakanda. -Yeah. -Let me get this right. So you'd rather think Wakanda and Zamunda are real, -right? -Yes. -But I bet you don't even know where Liberia is on the map, do you? -Not exactly. -Mm-hmm. Yeah. See, that, my Black brother, that don't make no sense to me. Preach, my queen. -Yes, baby. -"Preach, my queen." "Preach, my--" You from Hyde Park, bro. Hyde Park. -Such a hater. -"Preach, my queen." -David. -Yeah? So, Wakanda and Zamunda. Not real places? - They don't exist, bro. They ain't real. - What? Wow. - They ain't real. -We been hanging for a minute, you wasn't even gonna tell me. You got me out here looking-- Yeah, okay, brother. Gosh, I can't believe he thought those were real. Leave the bottle here! Come on! Hey, Mum. Good morning. Good morning, my son. - How are you today? - I'm doing fine. Great day. Uh... where's Dad? Ah, you know your Dad like to take his time. He upstairs. He be down shortly. -Okay. -Something wrong? -Oh, no. I'm fine. -Okay. -Hey, son! -Pops. -Good morning. -Yes. Good morning. And how are you and things at the office? -Couldn't be better. -Is that a good or bad thing, David? Is what's-her-name-- Roth-- is she treating you well? I know they were considering you, and by now, they should have made you partner. Well, they're still considering. Hmm. Anyway, um, what's new? I don't know, David. I'm reading newspapers, and when I'm done, I will tell you. What is it? What's on your mind? Speak up. Now that I won my last three cases, things are looking pretty good for me. Do you know Black people only make up 4% of lawyers in the United States? I can't even tell how many of them make partners. David... we are so proud of you. However, we are not surprised. But you know that we are Nigerians now, and so we expect the best from you. Abi? As for that 4%... 3.9, that's us now. Ah! - Thanks, Dad. - Yes. Great! We will celebrate this weekend. I will make your favorite pepper soup. Oh, that sounds great, Mum. Thanks. Ah, I will invite the Woodtors and their beautiful daughter, Bendu. -You remember her? -Well, I'd like to invite Lola. She loves you guys. Lola? David. You need to be with a Nigerian woman like Bendu. Henry, talk to your son now. David. Counselor. Dad. Now that you are winning cases, perhaps it's time that we should discuss the 20 million I've invested in you. 20 million? You mean in naira or dollars? - David. You got jokes now. - I'm just asking, Dad. We are in the US, and you're talking about nairas? I will be expecting 20 million US dollars from you. Okay, you mean Liberian dollars. That was a good one. That was a good one. Bendu is smart and respectful, and she understands our traditions. - Thanks, Mum. - All right. You're welcome, my son. David. Do you want me to invite Bendu over for dinner? Mmm, mmm. This is good. It's really good. -What? What's wrong? -Hold on, it's David. Hey. Yeah. I'll grab it for you. Okay. I'll see you later. -All right, let's go. -Wait. You'll grab it for him? What are you talkin' about, Lola? Every day we're out here trying to keep our bodies lookin' right, all the cute guys trying to holler at us, and obviously you stuck on David. Girl, stop making yourself so available to him and let him chase it. Look, I am not stuck on David. I thought we'd been through this already! David and I are-- are-- - It's complicated. - Yeah, okay. -And I don't always make myself available to him. -Yes, you do. Girl, every time he calls, you stop and answer. If you want him to appreciate you, let him appreciate you, so you guys can become a real couple. Send him to voicemail. We do work together. Okay, well, what did he want this time? He asked if I could stop by the store and grab some milk. What? Grab him some milk? God, does he want you to get some cereal, too? He's allowing me to stay at his place until my bathroom is done. -That's the least I can do. -Okay, Lola. I am not about to accept advice from a woman who doesn't have a man. Oh, I don't have a man because I have too many men chasing me. -Oh? -Uh-huh. -Sam seems to like you. -Ew. No. Ew? Sam is attractive! Girl, Sam is goofy. Real goofy. That makes the two of you. Come on, let's go. -Lola. -Santiago! -How are you? -I'm good. -You good? -Yeah. I remember you from college. -Aja. Aja. How are you? -I'm good. -You good? -Yeah. And my girl here, she's single. - Girl! -I just-- Since you guys already know each other. When are you gonna come over to good side? I always said you would do well as a prosecutor. Good side. That's interesting. I think I'm pretty comfortable at private practice. -Are you comfortable? -It's David. -What? Really? -Mm-hmm. -You still hangin' on to David? -Yeah, she said he's just a friend. That's because he is just a friend. I'm playing soccer against that guy's team. -Ah! -Tomorrow. -Oh. -So now he's "that guy." -Wow. Okay. -He's just so insignificant. I always forget his name. What is it? Davido-- Kunta. Kente! -Wow, shots fired. -Shots fired. -It's David. -David! -Uh-huh. -David. That's his name, David. I defeated him in court a few times. How could I ever forget his name? -That's funny, but you're real petty. -I am petty, ain't I? Listen, uh, these muscles ain't gonna grow themselves. I gotta go. Gotta stay fit for the courtroom, and maybe dinner with you? Yeah, uh, 7:30 p.m., Friday night. - I can give you her address. - Girl! - Your number still the same? - Yes. Uh, 555-6830. - Aja! - I'll be giving you a call. You look so good. I'ma call you. - Damn! He is fine. - Oh, my God! - Yes, he is. - I want her so bad. Let's go, fellas! Oh, oh, oh, oh! Oh! All right, dude. - The ball. - Let's go! There we go. Now y'all playing! Let's go! - Hey, hey, hey. Come on now. - Now y'all are playin'! Whoa! Oh, fuck! You good, boy? Come on, bud. Let's get up. - What happened, boy? - It's on. He so petty. What? - Did-- did David just step over Santiago? Yes. Yes, he did. Wow. Yeah. He so petty. The both of them are petty. Both. Yeah. Here you go. Thank you. You're welcome. I know you're a busy man and all, but your laundry is piling up. Do you wanna help me? I appreciate you for letting me stay here, but I am not your maid. - I never said you were. - But you act like it. What you doin' out here with all this ass? Seriously? Get off your dang phone. -I'm just replying to mail. -I don't care. If it's not work-related, I need your undivided attention. Oh. Like the attention you're giving to Santiago at the soccer game? Yeah, I saw that. What was that about, though? You and Santiago are like two petty females, and it's not attractive at all. Whatever. Are you jealous? Jealous? Of course not. I'm just concerned about the kind of company you keep. Oh, so now you're concerned about me. How's your knee feelin'? Better. It looks good. So, when is your place gonna be ready? Are you ready for me to leave? Can I have my phone back? No. Instagram will be there in the morning. Come on. Thanks for checking in. Mm-hmm. Okay. Knock, knock. Folder. Oh, come here. - Thank you. - You're very welcome. Um, Mrs. Roth will wanna see you in the conference room. - Okay, I'll be there in five minutes. -Okay. - So, I sign here? - Hey. Um, rumor has it that this case can make you a partner. Congratulations in advance. David Eguasa here is our number one guy, but he doesn't win without Lola Henderson, -also one of our very best. -Good morning. David, Lola, thank you for joining us. Mr. and Mrs. Deng have been referred to us by our very good friend, the mayor. I'm gonna pull your other cases so that you can give them your undivided attention. -They're from Africa. -Uh, we are from Uganda. I know Uganda. Their son is fighting deportation because of an unlawful firearm conviction. Allow me. I don't know what got into my son. I don't understand this, because he has never exhibited any type of violent behavior. He is a well-mannered young man. I am sure he was provoked. So your son shot an Uber driver during an altercation? Look, my son Eric is no criminal. There has to be a reason for this. I don't understand why he had a gun. Well, it seems like Eric has had multiple offenses involving a firearm. His first was bringing a loaded gun to school his sophomore year, and his second was possession of a loaded, unregistered weapon on the armrest of his vehicle. Let's start at home, Mr. Deng. What do you do for a living? Um, me and my wife own an import-export business here in America and in Kampala, Uganda. My family is very well-respected in the community. We help others start and maintain their businesses. In our culture, it is not right to do well and not help the village. We take our responsibility very seriously. This is why I specifically requested for you. We're a team. So, your son, Eric. Is he involved in the family business? Yes, he is. He's the one that built the website. He has been distributing flyers for the business all over town. He's even part of the people that organize the food drive every year. He's passionate about helping people. What about school? Um, what kind of grades does he get? Is he, um-- Does he get along with the students, teachers? Does he involve in sports? Oh, what does this have to do with defending my son? Mr. Deng, what I'm trying to understand is what could have caused this, uh, uncharacteristic behavior in your son. You know, what could have triggered him to want to make such a decision, to buy a gun and use it. - Who's on trial here? - It's his style. But, David, just let up a little bit. My son was a very good student. Top of his class. Mr. Deng, here's what we're trying to understand. The man handling this prosecution is an animal, so we need to know everything about your son Eric. The size of his shoe, where he lives, when last he went to a strip club. Does he have a girlfriend? My son does no such thing. Well, does he have a girlfriend? Not that we know of. See, Mr. Eguasa, we are going to make sure that you have everything that you need to win this case, but my son cannot go back to Kampala. Mr. and Mrs. Deng, we will do everything possible to defend your son. Ah! I figure that's the reason you wanted two plate. One with extra jollof. -That is not acceptable. -What isn't? The extra plate of jollof? I'll slap you across your head. Mum, I don't get this. Lola and I have been friends since high school. Then, you didn't complain. Why now? Because your father and I wanted you to have fun. You wasn't ready for marriage. Can't believe I'm having this discussion with you about a girl, an American girl who loves your jollof rice. David! She doesn't know how to even cook jollof. And I'm your mother. And I don't understand. And you know your father. He would definitely not understand. Wasn't it you and Dad who told me to go after what I wanted? Don't twist our encouragement to justify your behavior. Oh, so that only applies to when I'm doing what you guys want me to do? -What, David? -Mum, for crying out loud. Lola might just be my long-lost cousin. Maybe we should do a 23andMe test to just, you know, clarify. Who knows? Stop laughing. This is not funny, David. Your decision will affect our family. What would people think? You know what, Mum? My food is getting cold. -Mmm. -I'll see you later. -Mm-hmm. -Let's just say Lola and I are friends. Hmm? -Friends? -Yes, friends. - David. - Save that stuff for me, okay? Love you. "Friends." Hmph. Who does the boy think I am? Hmm? Hey. Man, I say hey. Huh? You-- you talkin' to me? I sure as hell ain't talking to myself. I'm fine. How are you? Locked up. It'll get better. Considering our current situation, it has to get better. So what happened, man? How'd you end up in here? - My Uber driver attacked me and my friend, so I pulled out a gun and I shot him in the leg. In the leg? The same old story. Now let me guess. The cops didn't bother askin' for any witnesses, right? Yeah, you-- you'll be good, man. Long as you got a concealed carry, you'll beat the case with self-defense. It's a little bit more complicated than that. - Oh? - No concealed carry? Man, they're tryin' to deport me for some shit that wasn't even my fault. I can't go back to Africa, man. -They'll-- -They'll what? Shit, man, I wish I was African instead of the facing the time I'm facing here. You lucky. Let the judge give me a choice between Africa and jail. I'd be walkin' through there, putting my finest dashiki, dancin' like a Zulu warrior. Why are you here? Ah, man. Forgot to pay a traffic violation. Judge issued a warrant for my arrest. Man, SWAT team came to my house, like, 100 deep. Really? A hundred police officers? I'm just playin', man. It was just this one little fine little dime piece, man. Came in, threw the cuffs on me, and locked a brother up. Moms was crying, 'cause, you know, they lockin' her baby up. Geez. I'm so sorry to hear about that. So, how long you in for this traffic violation? Couple hours? Maybe out in the morning. Never mind. -Hey, girl, what's up? -Hey, ma. What's up? Nothin' much. What's going on with you? Well, my fiancé and I... ...are about to go do our wedding registry. Wait, y'all still coming over? Did you really just call to ask me that? Of course I will see you later. -Hey. -Oh! David's here. I'll call you back. All right. Talk to you later. Bye. Sorry I'm late. I was on the phone with my mum. -Oh, just talking to your "mum"? -Silly. -So, check this out. -Yeah. I was going over the case. I think he has an obsession with guns. Plus, like you, he loves Africa. Goodness, all you ever talk about is how beautiful it is. What's your point, Lola? Why is he so adamant about not being deported back? And don't say because this is the land of the milk and honey. Like, I need to know exactly why. Well, 'cause he's been here since he was ten. Okay, but he's never been back to visit. His parents have, but why would they leave him behind? Lola, look. Nobody wants to be deported from the place they know and call home. Technically, he's American. No, technically, he's still from Uganda. And that's exactly why the system wants to deport him. Listen. His parents paid us a lump sum of money to prevent that from happening. -So let's play ball. -David. -Yes, Lola? -Look, if you look over the case, you'll see that every time he's caught carrying a gun, he's always in a particular area. So what are you saying? Okay. This is exactly why you need me. I'm extremely detailed and very observant. This guy graduated the top of his class, he comes from an extremely wealthy family, and he's only had one girlfriend his entire life. And? And? Is his girlfriend American? Like, why is he keeping her a secret? We need to get to the bottom of this. Okay. You have a point there. Sorry, let me get this. It's Sam. Well, let me get this, okay? -You have a good point there, though. -Mm-hmm. Hey, bro. What's up? Yo, David. I've been thinking, bro. You know, my grand opening's in a few days. I got a good idea. I think we should tell Lola to invite Aja. Listen to this. Well, I think Aja has her unique plans to come already, but you want to send her a special invitation, right? David. Do you have me on speakerphone? - David, why do you have me on speakerphone, bro? Why do people do that? Hey, Sam. I wanna come to the club! Take me off speakerphone, bro. Take me off. Right now. These are the files you can go through. -Are you good? -Yeah, I'm good. Take me off, man. Take me off speaker phone. Sam. Come get me. I'll call you later, bro. -Leaving already? -Yes. - Where you going? - To the club. Bye. I just got here. Myself with that one. - Oh! - Mm-hmm. - Okay. - Mm-hmm. Not bad. It's my little place, you know. Okay, Sam. Yep. Wait till I turn the lights on. I see you. You could have took the chair down for me. Oh, you got it, sis. You got it. I'm strugglin'. There you go. Yep. It's gonna be good. Sam... why is David so confusing? Why is David so confusing? He's not confusing, he's... quite simple, actually, like most men. You're just too emotionally attached. - Explain. - I just did. -Why does he treat me like I'm one of the fellas? -Because that's what you allow. I'm not about to try to control a grown-ass man. No, you can't control David, but you can control how you respond to him. It's just about setting up boundaries. -Boundaries. -Boundaries. Look, enough of you and David. What's up with Aja? -You really wanna know? -I asked, didn't I? I may have mentioned the fact of you two together. Yeah? What'd she say? She said "Ew." "Ew"? -The hell is that supposed to mean? -Google it. I mean, I know what it means, but what she mean by "Ew"? I-- I mean, I guess she's not interested. What? I don't want her big head ass. No way. Honestly, she said you can't handle all that. Oh. So she must not know I'm bow-legged. -That doesn't mean anything. -It does over here. -Oh, my gosh. -Oh, man. -I'm not chasing her. I'm the catch. -Oh? -Yeah. -Well, you know this is Aja we talkin' about, so you might wanna put on some running shoes. Yeah. I'm just messin' with you. Look, go ahead and make me a drink, please. Okay, what you want, girl? -Something nice and sweet. -Nice and sweet. With cranberry juice. Oh, give me the bottle, please. -Cranberry, okay. -And what kind of chasers do you have? You know what? We're out of ice and chasers. -No cups, chasers. -Oh, my gosh! What kind of establishment is this? Gotta take a shot from here. Let's go. Come on. - Okay, ride the boat. Come on. - Oh, there we go. - Oh, okay. - Stupid. I'm thinking something light. - Okay. - Nothing too heavy. Well, just so you ladies know, the colors are gonna be purple and gold. - Ooh, purple and gold. - Perfect. Look who just walked in like the world revolves around her. Oh, you know, just wanted to give you a daily reminder of who's the baddest, you know? -I'm a ten. -Okay, whatever. Look, did you all finish the website? Because we need it done by the 25th. -Yes. -I need to send out the invites. -Yes. -The website. Relax. I got this. She acting like this her own wedding. Excuse me. You relax. I just wanna make sure that this is the perfect wedding for my friend. You come in here, cursing everybody out in Swahili. I bet you bring that Italian guy to the wedding. Actually, he's Greek. -Ooh? -Yes. Oh, so you just gon' colonize an African wedding? Right. Actually, Aja, maybe I won't. I think I just might call up Dave. Dave is single, right? Okay, because I was under the impression that it was Lola-- -yes, Lola-- -No. ...who was in queue waiting for Dave to get it right. -No? -No, it's not. You don't know the secrets. Girl, Lola's actually seeing somebody named San Diego. - Santi who? - His name is Santiago. It's pronounced Santiago. And I'm not seeing him. Yet. Girl, he is exotic. -Ooh. -And he speaks fluent in English and Spanish, and he's a lawyer. - Ooh, girl. - And his shoe size? On point. Mmm! And his teeth? His teeth were straight and white. When I tell you ladies, this man is fine. -Fine. Mmm. -Ooh. So you mean there's someone other than Dave that has Lola's attention? -Mm-hmm. -Okay, Lotten, what is up with all this shade? Oh, she's throwin' all that shade because she's just mad that she's not the maid of honor. "Oh, she just mad 'cause I'm not--" No. Actually, she's my sister. And she's promised me since we were kids in Liberia, right? Right, Lotten. Oh! Y'all, did I tell you the time I dated this African guy? I dated him and he kept breakin' up with me for, like, years. That's 'cause he said I didn't know how to cook African food. 'Cause I kept making steak tacos for him. I told him, "You know what? Just pretend like you Mexican." - But, then he came back, he started dating me again. Guess what I started making for him? - What? - Fufu. - Fufu? - Yes. What? Girl, you made fufu? And I learned how to quickly make me some fufu. - Oh, yes. - That would do it. -Mm-hmm. -Mmm! Cheers to fufu. Yeah, fufu! I need to learn how to make some fufu. -Fufu! -Fufu! Fufu! Yes. Alexa, how do you make pepper soup? Here's what I found on the web. Pipefish and broth. Maybe I should spell it. Alexa, P-E-P-P-E-R soup. Pepper soup. Pipefish, uziza leaves, ehuru seeds, Scotch bonnet, -uda, crayfish, ginger, chili, onion... -You gotta be kidding me. -...fennel, tamarind pulp, cloves. -Alexa. Does Campbell's make a pepper soup? - No. - Oh, no. Hey! There you go! Good evening, everyone, good evening. Welcome to the world-class, the world-famous Riddles Comedy Club. This is our opening. It took a lot to get me here, but we're here. Wanna say "What's up" to my homie David. I see you in the crowd, man, the whole gang over there. My good buddy Sokal. I'm sure he just snuck in here because he's cheap as ever, but... I still appreciate the support, you know? Who here has kids? Man, bro, I was almost late. I was babysitting my nephew, and, like, these new kids are different. He's allergic to juice. And iPads, right? That's, like-- that's his thing. So, you know back in our day, if something was wrong with the game, you blow in the cartridge, you spray the Nintendo, Sega. Not these new kids, man. If the iPad turns off, he goes crazy. It's like he wasn't born with an umbilical cord, he was born with an iPhone charger or something, right? It's nuts, so. I don't know. I don't think I'm gonna have kids. How's the pandemic been treating y'all? Like, post-pandemic. Everyone been cool post-pandemic? My pandemic was okay, but post-pandemic's been weird. I've been having, like, a lot of bad sex. I mean, a lot of bad sex. I don't know what's the cause of it, so I told a buddy about it. He was like, "Man, you gotta get some sea moss. Black people are crazy about sea moss right now." So I went over on Madison and Pulaski and bought some sea moss, and, um... it was jerk sea moss. Yeah. It tastes good, but it didn't work at all, so. I'm still having bad sex. But anyway, I don't wanna keep you all day. Wanna bring on this comic who's a lot funnier than me, so put your hands together for comedian Correy Bell! Y'all keep it going for my buddy Sam here. Jerk sea moss? Keep your day job, buddy. This is... not really good for you. - Everybody good? You guys good? - Yeah. Yeah. Sam was talking about the pandemic, and you know what? I-- I know that the pandemic is not over, but I'm over it. Like, I'm over these masks. I-- Like, I'm having too many issues with 'em. I had an issue the other day. Look, I'ma tell y'all, 'cause it's only-- only us in here, and y'all not gon' tell nobody. Anybody ever... - man, you ever sneezed in your mask? - Okay! - -Like, that is the wor-- Like, you can't get it down fast enough. Like, it is the absolute worst. The other day, I was goin' in the store, and I was gettin' ready to walk right into the door, and before I knew it, I couldn't get my mask down, and I sneezed right inside my mask. I didn't know whether I should be happy, or sad, or cry, or be angry. But I did what any human being in my position would do. I flipped it inside out, okay? I'm protected on the inside of this mask. This nasty virus was on the outside of that mask, all right? I walked right in the store. Hey, ain't got nothing to do with me. I'm protected. All right? And it's crazy because I've been dating. I've been dating a lot. Anybody else dating? Like, dating is great. The hardest part right now about dating - is that my husband keep finding out. And I don't know who keeps telling him about my Tinder profile, my Plenty of Fish, but I wish y'all would stop snitchin'. Like, seriously. I keep planning these dates. He keeps showing up with flowers. Like, something has got to give. I mean, I need the world to open back up really, really quickly. You play too many games with me. How do you mean I'm playing games with you? You know I'm not a mind reader. I never said you were a mind reader. I have and know how to articulate my feelings very well. You think you know how to articulate your feelings, but you don't. You always want me to guess. - David, you are full of shit. - How am I-- -Full of shit? -Yeah. I have bled my heart out to you. But you ignore it. Why? Because when it comes to your parents, you bow down to them. Whoa, whoa. Just relax, okay, Lola? Don't laugh at me. I'm not laughing at you. I'm laughing with you. I'm not laughing. When we go to your parents' house, you make me sit and wait in the car. When before we introduced sex into this mess of a friendship, I used to go inside all the time. Lola, look. I don't want my parents in our business. David, admit it. You're afraid that if they see how you look at me, they would disown you for falling in love with a Black American woman. Come on, now. It's not that deep, okay? But it is. David, I love you. I loved you ever since we first met in college. You're blind if you can't see that. I care about you. You care about me? Wow. Where you going? To love you from the couch tonight, David. -Lola, come on. -Good night! Lola. Come on. Ready, David? Mr. Deng, my name is David Eguasa. Here's my colleague, Lola Henderson. Your parents retain our services to represent your case. Great. It's nice to meet you guys. So, your parents painted you as this perfect young man. We need your help to paint the same picture to the court. Can you do that for us? Eric, what's your fascination with guns? -My fascination with guns? -Yes. Your fascination. It's a long story. Well, we have about an hour to speak with you. I spent a lot of time being bullied. Eventually, I just grew tired of it. For some reason, the African-American didn't like me because I was African. They said I was too arrogant. And of course, the white kids didn't like me because I was Black. I was fine until it got violent. - Violent? - I was attacked. - For being African? - Where are you from? - Nigeria. - Raised? Between here in the States and Nigeria, yes. So you know what I mean. Well, I was never physically attacked. Well, maybe 'cause you're a lot tougher than me. Eric, when did you start carrying guns? One day after school, a couple of kids decided they wanted to make me their punching bag. But I wasn't having it. The first boy approached me, and I hit him before he could hit me. That's when they all jumped in and attacked me. After that, I decided I wanted to get a gun. So, were you physically injured? Did your parents notice anything? Black eye and bruises all over my body. When I got home, I simply told my parents that I tried out for the football team. - Soccer. - Yeah. That made my dad proud. After that, I purchased a gun and kept it in my bag. The rest is in my file, I'm sure. Did you ever have a girlfriend in school? - A girlfriend? - Yeah. Someone who we may use as a character witness, or someone who may have been there during one of the attacks. 'Cause I was looking through your file, and I don't see anyone. It was just always you and some guy fighting the bullies. No. No one special. They want to deport you back to Uganda. -I-- I can't go back there. -What if that's not what you want? We're gonna need your help to make sure that doesn't happen. - Well, what do I need to do? - Be honest with us. I am being honest with you! Okay. Okay. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. We're here today to decide the case of the United States Government vs. Eric Deng. Counsel, have you prepared your opening arguments? - Yes, I have, Your Honor. - Let's hear it. - Let's get this show on the road. - -Okay. Your Honor, every day, immigrants have been deported back to their home countries. Oftentimes, these people don't even know their way home, because they've lived in America and haven't traveled back home for years. Some can't even speak the language anymore, because they're fully integrated into the American way of life. While some don't even have living relatives back home. But with your help, we can save Eric from experiencing this fate. He moved to the States when he was a preteen, and has been a productive citizen of the United States up until his recent felony conviction that we'll explain in detail. I am sure we can all relate to Eric's experience, because sometimes in our lives, we are faced with making decisions that change the direction, the course of our lives. Eric made one mistake. He believed he was defending a friend. But now, he's faced with being taken away from the place he calls home. I hope that you can make the best decision in this case. Thank you. Thank you for this time, Your Honor. Fine people of this great country are called to duty once again. And it is our civic duty to do our part in helping keep America the safest place in the world. Unfortunately, there are some who slip through the cracks and wreak havoc on our streets. Eric is one of those people taking the freedoms that we fight for, for granted. Now, if this had been his first run-in with the law, we wouldn't be standing here. Hell, if it was his second, we wouldn't be here. But the fact of the matter is, this is his third run-in. When is enough enough? All of Eric's offenses involves a weapon, and now he has shot someone. Do we want to give him a chance to kill? Absolutely not. There is no justification for this young man's behavior. He has proven, time and time again, that he does not belong on American soil. We must do what is right for American citizens and deport Mr. Deng before he wreaks any more havoc on our streets, on our American soil. Eric is part of the decay that we see each and every day. Thank you. I wonder what the judge's verdict is gonna be. Well, um, I don't think what he did was, like, really extreme. -I think it's gonna be fair. -Yeah. I guess we gotta see. -How's your sandwich? -Mmm. It's good. -How's yours? -Mmm. All rise. Be seated. Eric, you seem like a good kid, with very loving parents, and I'm not sure why things continue to go wrong in your life. Unfortunately, you have an obsession with guns, and this was taken into consideration. And the court's decision is to move forward with this deportation. This is based on the penal code count 8 USC, 1227 (a)(2)(c). According to the United States government, you've now been issued a deportation order. You will be released to Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, and you will remain in their custody until this order is enforced, Mr. Deng. You have the right to file an appeal with the Board of Immigration Appeals in the next 30 days. -Do you understand me? -Yes, Your Honor. Court is adjourned. Lola's across the street, filing for an appeal. I've been to Uganda before. -Oh, really? -Mm-hmm. -It's beautiful. -It's very beautiful. -Nothing like you see on American television. -I'm telling you. You know, I tell them all the time, "Listen, this is not the Africa I grew up in." You know, it's different. Eric, what's the relationship between you and Tyler? - I'm sorry, it's just that-- - Listen, Eric. I need to know everything so I can stop this deportation order. Deportation... I was ten years old when I left Uganda. I still remember that to this day. - I had no idea why we had to leave. I cried so hard. I love it so much. I miss it so much. -But I can't go back there. -Why can't you go back? Hmm? Why can't you go back, Eric? My parents are gonna hate me. Talk to me, Eric. Why can't you go back to Uganda? - Because... - Because what? Because... Tyler's my boyfriend. Guard? Let's go. David? You okay? Eric is gay. That was why the Uber driver attacked him. A hate crime. -Self-defense. -Exactly. Bring in that Uber driver or anyone that witnessed the altercation. Lola's on it already. - The driver? - We're on it. Hey. Have some good news for me? Uh-oh. I know that look. -Mm-hmm. -What is it now? -You know what it is. -What? You know, preparing for Comfort's wedding just has me thinking about our situation. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Just slow down now, Lola. -Where you going with this? -Don't make me pour this coffee on you. I thought I got you hot chocolate. Hot chocolate, coffee, it's the same thing. David, not to sound cliché, but I deserve a wholesome relationship. A man who loves me. You know I'm not out here sleeping around. We've been back and forth for so many years without a real commitment. Professionally, we're great. You're my best friend. Come on. All the other couples that we've been around, they say that those are the key elements of keeping sparks in their relationship. Dude, I feel like I practically beg you to be with me. Like, what is it? Like, look at me! I am sexy as hell. I deserve more than this. Yeah. You deserve more than this. Now, what is it? I mean, is it someone else? If so, just tell me. If so, just tell me! And let me do me. Yeah. When you haven't said anything, that's exactly why you also haven't committed, too. Lola, look. I have a lot of things on my mind right now. I mean, we just lost a case. This guy is about to be deported back to Uganda. And if he does, he's gonna be killed. Kill-- What do you mean, killed, David? -Eric is gay. -Duh. I swore an oath to defend this guy, only to find out that he's gay. Like, I don't even know what I'm doing right now. I don't know what to do. -Like, if it was in my country-- -In your country, David? Newsflash: it's your job and your duty to defend that young man, despite whatever your traditional beliefs may be. Look me in my eye and tell me that you're okay with allowing another young Black man dying. Of course I'm not okay with it. Good. I know you. You're so damn sexy right now. Oh, my gosh, you get on my nerves. Lola... I really do love you. That's the first time you ever told me that. I said it a couple of times. -I don't recall. -Through my actions. -Really? -Yeah. David... Look. Thank you. And you may be willing to toss your career away, but not me. I am going to file the appeal, so get ready to man up. -Man up? -Yes, man up. What do you mean? Whatever your traditional beliefs may be, just-- Man up, get ready. And by the way, this hot chocolate is delicious. Sure, of course. I know how you like it. It's all the actions. Oh, God. Excuse me. -It's my mum. -Mmm. Tell your "mum" I say hello. I'll call her back. So... would you wanna go to this comedy show with me? I can use a good laugh. I'm sure you would. What do you want me to wear? Wear a dress. No undies. -Oh, God. David, let's go. -I know you like it. Come on, now. - Come on. - Come on. Really? Hey. You stalking me now? I don't stalk. Thanks. How's that appeal coming? It's coming. Even after a loss, you are just absolutely stunning. What's your secret? You know... water. Lots of rest. Exercise. You know they say Black don't crack. Indeed. Mi abuela, she would always say... -She sounds like a smart woman. -She is. I wonder what you would look like if you had won. Okay... What's going on with this? -With what? -With this pursuit. I like it when you call it that. A pursuit. I don't stalk. Okay, yeah, but... is it real? I can tell you over a nice steak and a glass of wine. Well, I'm vegan. But... maybe I'll take up your offer on the glass of wine. Your place or mine? Okay. I'll think about it. But until then, I'll see you in court. See you in court. -Thanks for the water. -My pleasure. My pleasure. - Thank you. - Of course. Read this. -Think it's funny? -Hmm. You don't think it's funny. Nah. Not as funny as the last one you told. Maybe it's the way you told it, but reading this right now? It ain't funny. Hmm. Thanks for your honesty. - Hey, Sam. - What's up? Would you get married to a woman from Africa? Mmm, probably if it was Charlize Theron. Come on, man. No, I'm just joking, man. The reason why I'm asking is 'cause-- I know why you asking, man. Lola. I don't wanna keep leading her on, you know? Then stop leading her on, bro. Look, man, you my best friend, so I can be honest with you. You go outside right now and you fighting two guys, I'm coming out there and we fighting together. -What about 20 guys? -I'm calling the police. No, we going down together, bro. You my brother. So I'm gonna stand with you on whatever decision you make. -Thanks, bro. -Yep. You can see it in her eyes, man. Yours too. You really don't like this joke, though? Let me see that again. Bro, you gotta try again, okay? -That bad, huh? -Yeah. That bad. Okay, all right. I-- Mr. and Mrs. Deng, I wanted to meet with you and Eric so we can go over the details of Eric's appeal. We were able to file a motion to reopen the case with this information. Eric has something he'd like to share with you. Well, what is it, son? Mom, Dad... I was just defending myself against people who don't like my kind. Because you are African? Because... I'm gay. What are you saying? - I'm gay, Dad. - What are you saying? Where did you learn this? From the white people on campus? Didn't learn it from anyone. I have always been this way. Elizabeth, are you hearing this nonsense? He is saying that he is homosexual. Elizabeth, are you listening? I knew it. -You knew what? -I knew it, and you knew it too. Ah... we both chose to ignore it. It does not matter now. What's matter is, Eric needs to get out of here. Dad... can you please not look at me with such disgust? Eric! Let's go. The judge is back. -I love you, son. -I love you too, Dad. Can you state your name to the court and your relationship with the defendant? My name is Tyler Smith, and... Eric is my boyfriend. On the night Eric was arrested, can you tell the court the events leading up to that? Well, Eric and I were just coming from the movies, and we wanted to get a quick bite to eat. Neither one of us wanted to drive, so we called an Uber. Everything was going smooth until the driver realized that me and Eric were sitting really close to each other. He got angry. He pulled over, and demanded that we get out. I can remember him saying things like, "Y'all are disgusting. Y'all need to be wiped off the Earth." That's when he grabbed his bat, came over to the passenger side, and yanked the door open. Me and Eric got out on the left-hand side. He kept charging us with the bat. He started swinging. And I fell. I just knew he was gonna bash my head in. I couldn't do nothin'. That's when I heard the gunshot. Mrs. Deng. Can you tell us about your experience in Uganda? Objection, Your Honor. Relevance. Objection overruled. Go ahead, Mrs. Deng. When I was a little girl in Kampala, I had a friend. His name is Moses. We're very close. See, Moses did not like to play football like the other boys. He was always so neat and clean, and a lot of the kids found it very strange. As we grew up and went to high school... Moses grew up so handsome. Almost pretty. And all of the girls in school was in love with him. One day, he told me that he's not interested in girls. I was so confused, 'cause I've never heard somebody say something like that before. I've never heard it in my life. But I promised that day... that I would keep his secret. I would never tell anybody, till today. One day, he decided to tell another boy... how he felt about him. A big fight broke up in school that day. The boy and his friends, they ran, they chased after Moses. He ran. He ran all the way to the market square that day. They chased him. And they caught up with him. They beat him black and blue that day. He was unconscious. I didn't know what to do, so I started to run. I ran all the way. To this day, I have never seen him again. Nobody knows what happened to him. Do you see Moses in your son? Yes. Did you fear for your son's life? I do. Objection, Your Honor! Relevance. I wanna see where the defense is going with this. Objection overruled. Go ahead, Mrs. Deng. Mrs. Deng, are you telling the court that your move from Kampala, Uganda to the States was because you were afraid for your son's life? I love my country. But I love my son more. And Kampala is not a place for a boy like my son. It's not. No further questions, Your Honor. You may step down. Your Honor, I'd like to present to you this exhibit as evidence to support the reversal of the deportation order. Since the passage of the Anti-Homosexual Law in 2014, the gays and the LGBTQ community have been tormented on the daily by the police and the citizens of Uganda. Court is in recess. Irene. This America is turning into something else. Where we are from, it is a man and a woman, period. Abi, I don't understand where this new behavior is coming from, this man and man, woman and woman. Adam and Femi. Eve and Chidinma. It is rubbish. Rubbish, I tell you. Henry... I understand this is not our culture. But we cannot sit here and allow this young man to get killed if he get deported. If it was our son, would you want him to get killed if he was gay? Well, I do not have to worry about that. We should have mercy on him, and pray the court will have mercy on him too. Just to spare his life. David. When you find a woman... let her cook as well as your mum. I'm in love with Lola. Ay! - Hey. - Hey. Great job. Thank you. Let's go save this guy. Does the prosecution have a closing statement? No, Your Honor. The prosecution rests. Interesting. Well, if I may. Eric, I have watched you during this trial, and you hold on to so much hurt, anger, and pain. Young man, we all deserve to be free by way of forgiveness. When we decide not to forgive-- because forgiveness is a choice-- we hold on to that pain. And then it begins to eat away at us. And then we seek the sympathy of others instead of taking charge and action of our own healing. It takes more energy to hate a person than to forgive them. So let go. Move on with your life. Stand up, young man, while I read this new order. I'm glad you finally came to your senses. - I was about to drop you from my Rolodex. - Wow. -You were gonna drop me from your Rolodex? -Yeah, all the way off. -Really? -You were gonna go to the bottom. Whatever. You know, I'm proud of you. You did a good job today. Thank you. Thank you for understanding. Thank you for seeing the bigger picture. And thank you for saving a life. Yeah. I think we all could do some good. Yeah. He's gonna have to do six months for the charges, though. -We understand. -Yeah. You know, you should accompany me to Comfort's wedding. I've always liked Comfort. You sure you want me to go, though? You know David's gonna be there. David is a non-factor. Yeah, I know. Thank you. You're so beautiful. Thank you. I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride. Whoo-hoo! Hey, Michael Jackson was right to make that song "Liberian Girl." These Liberian women are fine, bro. She about to be livin' la vida loca, all because you don't want her. -Shut up, Sam. -They're probably going to the parking lot to do sex. Shut up, Sam. Look, Lola ain't like that, okay? Bro, he has wavy hair. Italian wavy hair. Go and get that girl, man. Shit. So you want one of these African women in here? Nah. I already got me one. You think you can hang with me? You do know I'm from the West Side, right? You do know I'm from the South Side, right? What's that mean? I mean, you keep on playing on me, you gon' find out. -Really? -Really. You sure about that? -I'm sure about that. You know what else? -What? -That after we do this... -Mm-hmm. ...you gon' know that with me, you're always in good hands. -You sure about this? -Yes, I am. -You like that? -A little bit, yeah. Wait a minute. We need to go somewhere. Mm-hmm. Let's go. -Ready? -Mm-hmm. Let's go. -You smell so sweet. -Oh... You know all the right words to say. You want kids? Can we talk? What's up? -This is rude, David. -Can you stop? Please. Can we talk? Give us a few minutes. I'm going outside. If you ain't out there in five minutes, I'm leaving. -All I need is five. -Leaving for good. Yes, David? -I kissed you in my office. -And? We kiss all the time. Your kisses mean nothing to me. -It means something to me. -Well, not to me. What do you want me to do, Lola? I shouldn't have to tell you what to do, David. And now you have a few more minutes, counting. -You don't want that guy. -He is a man! He told me what his intentions were from the very beginning. Give me one reason, David, one, why I should pick you over him. Because you love me, and you know it. I can learn to love him. People do it all the time. You should know that. I do now. Lola, my intentions with you are pure. I'm no longer afraid or ashamed to love you. Just... give me one more chance to make this work. I promise you, I will right all my wrongs. Please. He's waiting for me. -Hey. -It's been ten minutes. Yeah. You okay? Look, I gotta go. You know, you're in good hands with David. You think so? Yeah. Santiago, you are one hell of a guy. I know. Kiss for the road? -Maybe a little one. -The cheek is fine. 'Cause I'd be devastated if you were mine and you kissed another man. Oh, gosh. Take care of yourself. See you soon? Yeah. See you later. Official? Official.
