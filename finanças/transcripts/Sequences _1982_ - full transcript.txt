"Truth is our master, We don't master the truth." Mihai Eminescu August 23rd 1944... a landmark in our country's history The best words to describe this turning point are: Everyone take up arms! The tricolour armband worn by volunteers of all ages, is a first sign that the entire working class is under arms. The army joins the fight backed up by the people whose national pride was stirred. The air was crystal clear after those hot days of August marked with red in the calendar. - Is this Grivitei Avenue? - No, it's Victoriei Avenue. - Andrei, don't forget the banners... - Yes, I know... And make sure we don't see those shop signs twice. That's how the scene should look like, when Matei enters the boss' office. - Can you load this reel again, please? - Load it again, please! These images are just a part of a long period of social turmoil, fighting, sacrifice and glory that justify the present and thefuture. Following the revolutionary policy of our Party, the Communist Youth will enrich with new heroic events future epics in years to come... I think it's clear now... There are two periods in our film: Matei's story, when the Party was banned... Florin, don't go please! - I'm going for a walk. - He's not interested... And the contemporary life of the descendants of those who fought... Please don't smoke here! I'm not smoking,, do you see me smoking,? What was I saying...? SEQUENCES... a film by ALEXANDRU TATOS with and the whole film crew makeup film editing sound associate producer costume design set design production executive director of photography written and directed by ALEXANDRU TATOS Yes, mummy, I got everything... Olives too... yes... ham too. And endives... cheese... feta... Don't worry, I'll buy the drinks and come home. Yes, I'll drive slowly, don't worry... I'll be home in an hour. Bye-bye, Mummy! - Where did you buy that cheese? - How to explain... I'd rather show you... But I was next... - Young man, that's too much! - Just a second. I can't believe it! I've been waiting for 15 minutes... I left the food on the stove... I need a recipe for a tart... Hello! Can I speak to Andrei, please? He went to the mountains? I'm his friend, Ion... Yes... I'll call back after New Year's Eve... Thanks very much, good-bye... Please, just a second... please! Hello! Can I speak to Stefan, please? Sorry... am I bothering you? I'm sorry... is this not a good time? I'll call again then... Shall I wait? OK, thanks! Thanks a lot. How rude... Go away... come back tomorrow! Are you not in the line? What manners! As the poet says: Oh Moon, you mistress of the world Over the skies round vault you glide. That's Mihai Eminescu. Excuse me, are you waiting, to use the phone? - And you too? - Yes! "We Want Land"... by George Cosbuc. You celebrated New Year's Eve earlier, didn't you? Last night! My wife sent me to buy bread. Rotten luck! Now I have to call her and tell her precisely where I am. - Budapest. - Poor me! Budapest Restaurant! Budapest Restaurant? Hi, Stefan... It's me... Don't you recognize my voice? It's me, Ion... I got out of hospital yesterday. I'm better, but I feel weak... I'm on a diet... I had hepatitis... Did I wake you up? Ah, your landlady... I'm sorry... "Poor Dionysus", by Mihai Eminescu: The empty bottle's only good To hold a burning candle And loneliness the poet may inspire. Stefan, what are you up to? I couldn't hear you... Sorry... What are you doing now? I see, it's a special night. What do you mean, where am I spending New Year's Eve? Nowhere... I told you, I just got out of hospital. I can't eat or drink. Yes, I'm going to the campus... It's quiet there. - Will he finish? For God's sake! - They're all on holiday... A bit of understanding,, we're all human! It's deserted... Yes, I called them all... Andrei is in the mountains... ...and Mihai is with... you know... But, listen, are you really busy all afternoon? We can't meet? Yes, I see... It's not about New Year's Eve... I'm down... and I'd like to talk to you... You know, the story with Ani... I'm alone now... Shall I call later? When? Around seven? I'll be all right... I'll wander about... Yes, it's not that cold... Good idea, I should go to a movie. All right then... Bye-bye! I'm very sorry! Who needs some coins? I don't need them any more. Emilia, step forward a bit! You're supposed to be moved... More troubled, come on... Clapperboard! "Happiness" 547, take 1! That's done! - What's next? - Wait a minute, what's going on here? Are you bullshitting me? Have a bit of understanding,! What understanding,? Do you take us for guinea pigs? How dare you? Do you have authorisation? You're from the Television? Big deal! Leave me alone! Do you have authorisation? - No we don't... - Then how dare you do this? I can't make a call without being filmed? Have a bit of understanding... He's only a young man... A snake at your breast. Where it might give birth What are you but a crazy coward? - T. Neculut? - Did I make them cry? I destroyed them! It was great, I was almost crying too. It's getting cold. I think we should all wait in the cars... ... we need new people at the phone box, this lot will attack us if we go back. Then we can do another take. - Shall we pack up? - Are you in a hurry or what? - Did you see that guy? - Yes, I did... I don't like mixing ordinary people with actors. I prefer normal conditions, proper lighting... Yes, but we'd never get such authentic reactions... I'm sick of his search for truth! We weren't supposed to work today! I didn't have time to prepare anything,! Is New Year's Eve is the only time we can get the truth? The bottle is here, the salami too, the cheese... - Well, how was it? - You want praise? - It was OK, wasn't it? - I don't know, we'll see... Let me see the rushes... You got scared? Kind of... Happy New Year! Bye-bye! Hello! - Who is it? - The carol singers. There's nobody home. "The stew is in the oven. If you don't want it, put it in the fridge." Florica Yes... Who is it? Good evening,! Thank you... I am very grateful that you thought of me. All the best to you too. With the family, I'll stay with the family... No, I won't forget you. I'll let you know if I have a part for you. Yes, all right. No need to thank me. Yes, a Happy New Year, good night! We have had great results. Our production keeps going up. Productivity increased by 8,7% last year. Emilia, get out of the away! Don't you see we're filming,? Am I in the way? - I'm cold. - Take my coat. Here is fine. Try to get everything. A bit wider... We made 10.6 million lei more than was planned. You want to film here? We have better places, like the new plant... It will finish in a few months time. Although, I admit, we had lots of problems... We had workers coming from all over the country... ten thousand of them. This has changed the balance of the city. We've had lots of complicated problems, plenty of trouble. But we sorted them out. We built new apartments. Further back a bit. That's fine. We'll start shooting in May, or April, when it gets warmer. We'll get all the authorisations we need. - Thank you very much. - You're welcome. Oh, sorry, here's your coat... Thank you! Thanks, I hope to see you again. Don't you want to see the canteen too? No, thanks. Just a few minutes. It's one of our great achievements... - Let's go to the canteen then! - Let's go. What shall we do in the canteen!? Damn it's five o'clock! My stomach thinks it's eight! - Have some crackers. - No, thanks! Bebe is sleeping. For posterity. - Take one of me too. - Piss off! It's been a good day... We did the building site. We found the "Stamate House"... - Where did we find it? - In Novaci! Novaci? - Where is that place? - In Novaci. - In Novaci? - It's none of your business! Says who? Drop it, go back to sleep! What about accommodation for the crew? And how will you get everything, to the top of the mountain? With a sledge! The "Stamate House" in Novaci! Filming there will cost a lot. I'm starving... Hello! They seem to have everything here, even toothpaste! Hello! - Comrade, we'd like something to eat. - We're hungry. - What do you want? - Anything,! I've only got what you can see here. Why don't you come in high season? We will... What's so funny? - I want to tell you something... - Let's talk somewhere quiet... The prosecutor's had a hard day today. He wants a big meal... what do you have? What prosecutor? They are his assistants... Conrade, you know what? I'm not impressed. Even if there were 10 prosecutors I could only give what is here! If they send food, I have it; if they don't, I don't. Is that clear? I don't want to shoot in Novaci! I'm responsible for the official budget! He is Comrade Prosecutor. Why did we stop in this shit hole? Wait till we get to the hotel. - Can't you see they've got nothing? - Wait, don't get upset. We'll sort it out. - Follow me and... - Sort what out? We'll sort it out! This way please, come in. - You're a great guy. - Come in please... He's with us too... - I don't believe it! - It's just part of the set! Write this down: In our restaurant... Just a moment. Is there anything wrong? Can you talk him out of shooting at Novaci? - Hey, you! - It's OK. He's with us. Cold, isn't it? - Why did I come on this location search? - Ask the boss... Gigi, come here! Why didn't you get enough chairs? The Conrade Prosecutor needs a... Where shall I find it? Shall I kick someone out? Hey, leave that chair alone! Get one from mine... ...mind which chair you take. Now, let's get your order. What would you like to eat? Well, toothpaste, brushes, what you have in the window... Leave that... If I don't have it here, I'll manage somehow. My customers are always happy. How about... steak and salad... - And some French fries? - You said you didn't have any meat! So what if I said that... I don't eat pork. I'd like some fish. So that will be two pork chops... ...three, four... But I don't eat pork. You let the Comrade stand like that? If I was your boss... He's very democratic! You're nice guys! That makes eight... - Eight pork chops! - No more chops, the grill is off! You do what I say! Will they fight? No more joking,, Conrade Prosecutor is here. Horsing around again? - What's this story with the prosecutor? - You'll hear after you eat. Are you bullshitting me? I've made over 20 films... ...and a half! You don't look like the type! Everything is on! Steaks are on the grill. Chips are in the pan. The bill please! - What will you drink? - Mineral water. Two steaks, right? - What about you, Comrade Prosecutor? - Do you have any mineral water? Comrade Prosecutor is not happy with something? Who's a prosecutor? I'm not a prosecutor! Don't listen to their bullshit! What are you then? The bill please! Bring beer and Pepsi and then I'll tell you! I'll see if there is any... - Listen... - Just a moment! I tell you a secret... and you shout it out... - What's the date today? - The 20th. He doesn't want people to know who he is... ...they might think he's abusing his position. Bring everything: The beer, the Pepsi, and behave yourself, or else... Here come the drinks! The music drives me nuts... turn it down... - Pepsi? - Nice chair... Where did you get it? From home. I live opposite... Very convenient! Beer? You have special chairs for special customers? No, it's from my dining room. - You have a dining room? - I do! - Do you have a sofa? - I do! - And a carpet? - A carpet too. Beer! Why do you ask about the carpet? To improve his general knowledge... - What would you like to drink? - Beer! - You got a car? - Pepsi! A Trabant. - Why are you drinking? - Why not? A little drink... - During working hours? - Once in a while. - I'm drinking because I'm upset. - Why's that? You have a car, a carpet, everything you need... You steal now and then. You drink and you steal! Why would I steal? If I stole my clients would suffer! The client is everything to me. What are you looking at? Scram! Get into the kitchen! Do those chops! And don't burn them. What a guy! He's really something,! He's unbelievable! I wish you had such a guy in your phony script... When you asked me to come location scouting... ...it felt very strange, but now, I see you meet amazing people, what a cast! Yeah, sure! - I hope we can use him. - Like a hole in the head! - Like a useless ribbon on a parcel! - Yes, but ribbons are useful... Give me a break! People don't die, or live, in our films. They're just numbers in a script. - What can I do? - All directors say that! Why is it so important to shoot the "Stamate House" in Novaci? Lunch is served... If you don't like it I'll kill myself. Please, turn that music down, it's driving me mad! What music? It's those guys over there! I'll seize their player in a minute! You're the boss here? - Who else? - You have no employees? Well... there's him! And the cook... And someone else, who's busy right now... In high season, in the summer, when it gets really busy, I have two waiters... There was another woman, but... I fired her! - What for? - She did something... I can't tell you. Is that why you're so upset? Tell us what happened. Conrade Prosecutor might help you. - Who? - The Conrade... I get it. I like you! Can I have another knife, please. I'll fire you all! Everything is a joke here! - Just a second. - Some bread too. - Why is the boss so angry? - Ask him. - Careful, he'll throw you out the window. - Or hit you with a tray! Enjoy your meal! What are you staring at? Get back in the kitchen! You have to be firm, otherwise they take advantage! Would you like anything else? I'm very upset... Very upset! Let me tell you what happened... Do you have any idea how upset I am? Listen... You said you'd stop that music! Right away, just a second. Is everything all right? Listen, I'm very upset... - Do you know what she did? - What? Let me tell you... She left in the morning... Said she was going, to the hairdresser... in town. And she came back in a car, late at night... - Who did? - My wife! She thought she could deceive me... Go to the hairdressers and come back late at night... by car! - Who did? - My wife. I was in the yard... it was empty here... ...and I saw it all. You know what I did? I made her sleep on the carpet, and the next morning I locked the wardrobe and threw her out... I don't care anymore! Maybe she really did go to the hairdressers? She didn't! Her hair wasn't done! She thought she could lie to me. I told her: On the carpet! In the morning I threw her out! She's the one I told you I fired. Now I have to serve you. What have I done? Why did she trample on my soul? How did I harm her? That's why I'm so upset. Why does she trample on my soul? I didn't harm her. She was everything to me! I did my best for her! If you give an inch they take a mile! You can't weigh your love, can you? It's not like a drink, a thing to be measured. Either you love or you don't. Do you think I was wrong,? Showing her all my love? How do I know? And stop that music! It's driving me nuts! I can't... The Mayor's son is with them! I told you. I think they turned it down. I feel bad about this joke. Why don't you eat? I'm sick of your jokes! I'll never work with you again. My head is spinning. - Will you have a hard drink? - No, thanks! We must go, it's getting late. The bill please. I did everything for her... I gave her my last penny... - The furniture, I bought it for her... - I told you... I don't steal, not me! The client is my priority... And she trampled on my soul... I made her sleep on the carpet and then, in the morning. I took the key from the wardrobe, and... out! Don't let it upset you! - The bill! - No bill... No bill for you... Can't I treat you? I like you. This was on the house! It's not your house! It belongs to the State. The bill. As you wish... All together or separate bills? All together! It's quicker. We can split it later. That's 8 steaks... times 17... What will I do now? All alone... It's terrible being alone! As the song goes... "It's bad to be alone!" You know what? You're still young, and the world is full of women... You'll find another... What about this one? ...8 trimmings... - The lady? She has no eyes for me! - Why not? You're somebody! If you know how to approach her, how to charm her... Cut it out, Costic?! Five Pepsis... seven beers... I don't want another woman... It's her I love. - How much is 7 times 4.50? - 31.50. 31.50... My head is spinning,! How much is mineral water? For Christ's sake! Where the hell do you think you are? One mineral water... How much is a mineral water? Please, don't go... Stay a bit longer... Let's go to my place! You're my guests! Thanks, you were very kind, but it's late... You have time... - Comrade Prosecutor... You at least... - I'm not a prosecutor! - I know you're not... - Let's get out of here. Wait! I locked the door. I'll open it... Please! Just a minute... - Come and see how I live. - It's getting late. I must show you something! Something extraordinary! Don't leave me like this. - OK! Move along! - Just for a moment. - I'll wait in the car. - OK, good night! Thank you very much. I would like her to come, too. If possible. Come in please. I'm sorry... I entered before you. You don't need to wipe your feet... Fancy place you've got here! You're well off! Thanks... This is the living room? This is the carpet I told you about... Great... Beautiful! What do you think? It was a lot of work though... Let me show you what I promised to show you... Allow me. It's right there... - Look! - What's this? My pencil sharpener collection! Look! Since I was a child I've always had a... A hobby? A craze! Whenever I saw a sharpener, I bought it! I wanted to be a civil servant... That's what I always wanted! But I dropped out of high school... - What a pity. - You're better off now. - Don't you think? - Sure you are... - Let me show you the bedroom now! - Don't bother. It's late. No, no! I promised! Come on, please! Well, if you insist... Come along. I have some friends with me. Good evening,! It's her... It's her. - You shouldn't bother... - Do you like it? I got it from my contacts at the warehouse. No, thanks, I'm not allowed to drink. I have contacts there, otherwise... Miss, please. No, thanks! Please... You can't do anything without contacts. I got it from the warehouse. Please, Miss... - No, thanks! - Please! - Please, I beg you... - No, thank you! Let's go, that's enough! Come on Costic?! Let's go! Hold on! Let me show you something... ...a curiosity of nature... Here it is. - Yes, it's unusual... - It goes through there... - Tell me, what do you do? - We make films. - What kind of films? - Feature films. You might make a film here one day! We might! Shall I give you something to eat on the way? No thanks, you've been very kind. Everyone has his troubles... I can't kick her out! Goddamn it! I love her, I can't help it. Tonight she sleeps on the carpet! Tomorrow she's out... ...and I'll be alone... Miss... If you come back tomorrow I'll have some fish... All right, good night! - Good night! - Good bye! Perhaps tomorrow. I'll wait for you tomorrow! OK. Just a moment... Good night, Comrade! Good night! Let's go! - Andrei - 35 lei. - OK. - Costel, 38.50 lei. You had an extra beer. - I'll pay on payday. - Cornel, 32 for you. - Do you want it now? Do you really insist on shooting at the "Stamate House" in Novaci? Talk! Cut... Hit him harder, don't just pretend! Spit it out! What's so funny? Quiet! This is not a party! One more time! Extras - get on the set! You hear? Everyone on the set! - Hello Mr. Pintilie! - What are you doing here? - Making a film with "Fellini"! - That's cool! Come on! Everybody in! Move it! Let's see: One, close up on Matei! - Write it down Ioana. - I'm writing. - Two: head shot of the inspector. - Yes. - Three: Wide shot. - They're all here. Stand them in two rows! Why only oldies? Is this a retirement home? Where can I find young ones? Don't give me that bullshit! You're a slob! What are we waiting for? Sit them around the tables. I'd like to see the 10kw spotlight again. Traian, turn on the 10kw. You there! Stop playing chess! The other one! Is Emilia ready? It's getting late! - Wait a minute... - Hurry up, he's yelling! Ready! Leave the mirror. You come in from the right... Enter the restaurant... looking for him... - What about the necklace? - Never mind the necklace! Listen to me! You come in and look for him. We pull back with the camera. Let's rehearse it first! When I get into the restaurant, shall I close the door? Of course, don't you do that at home? Tighten up the shot! Help yourself. Please! Sorry, I don't have anything better... In the old days... - A future star? Am I right? - I hope so. With your figure... You should make it. Are you hot? Japanese technique! Unbelievable! Japanese, my foot! It's a toy! - Colonel, this is our future star. - Oh, congratulations! How is it that no director has discovered her yet! Tragic. Incredible! Raise the camera! - Are you sure we can't smoke here? - The fireman will fine you. - What about the ashtrays? - They're props for the film. We will have smoke... for the film... Camera on the entrance! Emilia! Tracking shot! - Cut! It's no good... it's no good. - Why? You don't look like you're in a strange place, or that you were rushing,, or looking for someone! I woke up at seven this morning. Know what? Why don't you run three times around the set! - Do what? - Run three times around the place! Please! I'm not joking. Really, I'm not joking. Do it! - Why is he smoking,? - He's the director! The boss? So what? The rules are different for him? - Will it be long before shooting starts? - It depends. Sorry for asking so many questions. It's my first time. No problem, I'll tell you everything I know. Thanks! Do I know you from somewhere? I don't think so! I don't recall. - Why are you moving your lips? - I'm pretending to talk to you... Do the same. We were told to speak. How should I do it? It's easy, just watch me... Move your lips... If you can't do it, just say something. What? Anything it doesn't matter. It is not heard in the movie. We have to pretend we're talking. We have to laugh too, realistically. Come on, laugh! Laugh! Quiet! Forget it. You'd better say something. Attention! We're shooting,! Attention! - Who's that girl? - An actress. A little stiff, but very pretty. "Happiness" 274, take 2. Action! I'm watching the band... It makes them look ridiculous. Not really, the music is added during editing. That's how it's done. Cut! - Is it finished? - I don't know. Let's see. One more take! Clapperboard! The band! Over there! Attention! Action! - "Happiness" 274, take 3. - The band! Look around, look for him! Look for him! Are you sure we never met before? I'm sure! You have to laugh! - I'm sure I know you! - Maybe from films. - You're an actor? - Not exactly, but I've been in many movies. - Where did you work? - You think I'm someone else. Maybe. A bit forward. Look around! Walk... look for him... Go, go... Scan with your eyes. Keep searching. - Looks like she went into a corner shop. - Cut! My dear, you're still too indifferent. You're here to get news about your father, who's in prison... I don't want to look too melodramatic... Try chewing some gum in front of the camera, if you think that's modern acting. Why do you keep picking on me? What's this? Svetlana! - Now you found something else to pick! - What's this label here? You and your precious modern films! - Throw water on her! - What? How? Throw water, so she looks like she's been in the rain! - Get a grip, Sandu, that's too much! - Make-up! Quiet! Let's rehearse it. I'm sure I know you... If you insist, but I'm sure you're wrong,! Papasha! I beg your pardon? - Papasha, it's you! I recognise you. - What are you on about? You're Papasha. I don't understand. My name is not Papasha. - What's your name? - None of your business! You're Papasha! Cut. Send 3 and 4 to the lab... Ten minutes break, for the extras too! Turn the lights off! Ten minutes break, for the extras too! He's playing the big shot director! Why don't you make your own films? Stand on your own feet, don't work for others. If I was as well connected as him... He was a nobody at the Film School. If I hadn't helped with his films, he wouldn't have graduated. He bites the hand that fed him. - Eat this! - No, thanks! Come on, the break will be over and... ... he'll start shouting at me. He's good at that... Have some cucumber. Can you move that table! Set the chair in place. Paul, serve that customer and then look at Emilia. Step forward when we're filming. Wasn't there someone else at that table? - Of course there was. - There was another guy. - Where's Costic?? - He's never on the set! Costic?! Get a woman instead! You'll do! Not you, you're not a woman! You, over there. - Who, me? - Go to that table! That's not going to work, there's no continuity! You're killing me with your continuity! A woman will do. There were two men in the previous shot... Look at the photo! - I don't think you were sitting here, Miss. - I wasn't. - Who was sitting with you? - What? - Who was sitting here? - There was an old man, but he left! No! That's not possible! - Please give me my seat. - I was a piano player once. I'm a piano player too. Costic? told me to sit here. - That's my place. - No, it's mine. - Why did you sit here? - Sorry, I didn't know. For God's sake, sit over there. We're not jerking around here! Quick, they're waiting for us! Sit here and don't move! OK? You're avoiding me, Papasha! I've no reason to avoid anyone. - Did you recognise me, Papasha? - My name's not Papasha! - Why did you leave then? - I refuse to share a table with you. Why pick on people you don't even know. I know you Papasha. I won't forget you in three lifetimes! You are my youth... Papasha, Papasha! Don't Papasha me! I have nothing to do with your Papasha. You'd better laugh! You laugh too! No need to really laugh, they're not filming,! You're the same rascal, Papasha... My name is Ionescu, not Papasha. You mistake me for someone else. What are you doing there? Were you invited? Get back! - Look at her! Do you see her? - What shall I do with these? - This is from your father... - My father? It's all that he left... He saved it. Although they tortured him. His comrade brought it out. - And father is gone? - He was tortured to death. The microphone wasn't right. Carry on! And father is gone? He was tortured and he didn't survive... Hey you, what are you talking about? The bus timetable? Once again! Take that tray. Come on! Look at her. You see her for a second. Leave the tray. Costic?, send the fiddler to that table back there! All right... Father died in prison? You've changed a lot, Papasha! Amazing how old you've grown... You got a stomach now; grey hair... Anyone might think you're just a nice old man... How many years have passed? I don't understand a word of what you're saying... Like hell you don't... A lifetime... - I've changed too, haven't I? - How should I know? I've changed. My hair's grey, I'm bald... You don't recognize me, Papasha? I've never met you! I realise you might not recognize me... I didn't recognize you at first! You know when I recognized you? Your gesture with the handkerchief. When you wiped your forehead... You would beat me... then wipe your forehead... I see the same gesture now... How could I beat you when I've never even met you?! Sir, you're talking nonsense! What are you doing? You've changed places again! Wasn't I clear enough? Make-up, costume, come over here! Deal with these two... It's always the same with the extras. They should know by now, after so many films. - Give me light! - Not possible! You always say that! Look up! - Hurry up! - Just a second... Look at his hair... What can I do? I told him to get a haircut! Use some hairpins for now. Hurry up! Hurry up, Ileana! One moment please. I only have two hands! Attention! Quiet, please! Let's do a rehearsal. Papasha, you're ridiculous... Who would think that a character like you used to beat me... My God, did you beat me! You didn't care that I was just a kid! You would punch me, then wipe your forehead! You're out of your mind! I could take it when you would punch me, but when you kicked me... I thought I'd die. I only slapped you four times! - What was that?! - Four times, that's all. You're driving me crazy! Now then! Old Papasha has remembered! - You said you're not Papasha! - I am, but I only slapped you four times! - Good boy! Only four times? - Yes, only four! And the rest was just my imagination? Is that what you're saying? You're an old man, it's a sin to lie like that. It was you who kicked the teeth out of my mouth... - What a beating! - It was only four slaps. Really, so now you can remember? Well, who am I? Just a second... don't move! Titi! Nastase! The 5kw light... Spotlight on this face... that's it. - Light meter... - 5,6. Put the 4kw light on the other guy! Too much. Softer! - What's the reading? - 5,6. - Can you add a filter? - Get more filters ready. OK, let's shoot. All lights on! Turn all the lights on. - How many slaps do you remember? - Four! - Four? - Four! - Not three? - Four! - Two and a half? - Very funny! If you have such a good memory, tell me who I am! Ready, we're shooting... Did you light the candles? Quiet! Rolling,! - "Happiness" 175, take one. - Action! Emilia! Come on, who am I? Quiet, they're shooting. You said we should talk... Now we have something to talk about. - Tell me, who am I? - What does it matter? Then how can you remember four slaps? I never slapped anyone more than that! I never beat anyone in interrogations. Now we can really laugh! Hurry up Paul! You see her... Good, put the tray down, go to her! - They're real! - Yes, sure! - What shall we do with them? - Let's pretend we're eating. How? Look into his eyes. Put your head on his shoulder. It's from your father. It's the only thing left. I managed to save it. Cut, cut! - What's the matter? - They're not eating over there! Come on guys! We gave you food. You're supposed to eat it! - Excuse me... I've got a problem. - What problem? Sorry for bothering you, but the waiter... ...he isn't doing it right... the garnishings are all wrong,! I've no time for this! This is supposed to be a first-class restaurant... You know, I was the owner of a restaurant... It's intolerable. I can show you... Forget it! My actors are leaving,, they've got a show! If you worked for me I'd have fired you! OK, go! - You made a fool of yourself Papasha! - No, I didn't! Sometimes they put gas on the food, so no one eats it! It's cold. What do you expect, you're not at The Ritz! You know what, Papasha? You gave me an idea. - Don't you Papasha me! - Why not buy me a beer afterwards? Only if it doesn't get too late... Amusing... You and me at the same table, remembering our youth. - As you were saying Papasha... - Don't you call me Papasha! Would you like Inspector better? You swine! - Please, behave! - Really! What else can I do for you? I didn't mention your swearing! You would hit me and then swear at me... I only slapped you four times! "Happiness" 175, take 2! OK, have it your way! I think you're insane! You actually believe your own lies! I could say the same about you! - What? - You're not the first to... Let's drop it! Let's! Don't worry, I won't take my revenge... You're an old man now. I forget. Actually I didn't forget... but I will leave you alone. Your coffee. Say something, Papasha! What can I say? All this time I've been looking for you... And now we have nothing to say... - You were looking for me? - Of course I was! - Why? - To make you pay... Don't worry about that. I've already paid... 10 years in jail... Really? That's good news. But I don't care anymore. It doesn't pay for my suffering. Tell me something now... Who are you? What's your name? So many years since... Of course... Many years, even more victims... I was just asking! My name is Marin Iosif. Marin Iosif... - What year did it happened? - 1943. Maybe you don't even remember Roman? Of course, I remember Roman. He was not easy to forget... He was the man we most dreaded! He gave us a lot of trouble. Until one day... People are hard to understand... Why did he sacrifice himself? He had everything going for him... You probably think it was because of his faith! We only live once! Dig deeper, perhaps you can remember me now... I was involved in the Roman case too. Yes, I remember now... - You were the shop assistant, right? - Yeah! Roman was hiding in Popa Nan... You used to bring him food there... That's right... Tell me, how did you become an extra? I only came out of curiosity. To see how films are made. I'm retired but I can't sit at home and do nothing... I told you this is my first time. - What did you do in life? - Nothing important. Very average. Was I supposed to become somebody? Don't be surprised, Papasha... There's a lot to be said. And it hurt more than your torture. Nobody tortured you! It wasn't really like that. You drive me mad! I remember well; there weren't even four slaps! What are you talking about? You tortured me! But you didn't get a word out of me. You didn't have it tough! You knew nothing. You can say that now... If I had found you earlier... What would you have said? I might have said something else... Many people have lied about me in court, that I put them through hell. But I never saw them in my life! I suppose they did well out of it. You son of a bitch! You sick bastard! Reactionary pig. I'll teach you! Father? He died in prison? He never came back. A pencil? I feel like laughing and crying at the same time... Just a pencil?! Cut! More natural... more emotion. We should have feelings for those who fought... ...even if it seems melodramatic to you. - OK. - Once again... - Quiet! - What a bullshitter. Action! Rolling,! "Happiness" 279, take 2! Father? He died in prison? He never came back... A pencil... Should I laugh or cry? Just a pencil... Go away! I'm telling you! Quiet! Who's talking so loud? What happened? Why are you talking? One more take! - I told you not to talk so loud! - Because you didn't leave from this table! Even if I want to, I can't. The continuity! I don't care. Get out of here! Not so loud! How can we possibly sit at the same table? So we can share the bread? Fate has made a mockery of me! How I have suffered! - You suffered... I admit it. - You admit it! I do, but there's no point in getting upset now! You twist everything to suit you. I see you're old and frail, but you still manipulate words! In a way... ...you were innocent... ...just an extra, like here. Indeed, I was just an extra. I was just carrying out orders! You all deserved to be killed, for torturing and jailing us! Let me ask you then: how long were you in jail? That's none of your business! Not you! Some were in prison... Many were tortured... Roman, for example... He can say he has suffered, and he didn't talk! I've got you Papasha! You said you didn't hit anybody more than four times. I used to slap them only four times. I was doing preliminary interrogations. Then, they were handed over to R?descu. He was in charge of the Communists... He questioned Roman. I was there... I had seen a lot, but that time I got sick. He didn't say a word. Roman can say he was tortured, not you... You were an extra, but you wanted to be paid as a lead. Bastard! Son of a bitch! Get away from my table! Quiet! Are you nuts? You think you're playing the lead? I'll throw you out! Get them out of my sight! Throw them out now. I don't believe this! Can't you show any respect! We've done seven takes! I have to get wet again? I can't do it anymore! I'll get a cold. Come on, once more. Don't get upset. Attention! It was your fault! I'm telling you politely: Get away from me! I'm going. But first tell me... You know you were suspected... of having betrayed Roman, don't you? - How dare you? - It's still a mystery to me! We got an anonymous letter saying where Roman was hiding... I suspected you. You got away with it too easily, old man! - Papasha, if you... - I'm not Papasha! Quiet! You could put it like that. Cut! One more take! Put some glycerine... Why are you so stiff at that table now? Talk to each other! Action, extras! Rolling,! "Happiness" 279, take 7! Father? He died in prison... He never came back... A pencil...? Should I laugh or should I I cry? Just a pencil... That's all he left behind! My dowry... He was so trusting... ... that it would be fine... That it would be wonderful one day! Cut! Very good! Well done! - Photos! - Don't move! Remain at the tables. Lights off! One more. Lights off! That's it! Thank you very much!
