DIRECTED BY HUH IN-MOO Aren't you hot? Come here. Dung-gwang! Being a social worker is tough, huh? Where are you going? Mrs. Byun's house. And my name's Dong-gwang. Can't you call your son by the name you've given him? Who's the girl? Hyo-seon's daughter. Hyo-seon? The one who ran away to become a singer? Mom, let's talk later. Almost there. Grandma will be done with her work soon. Go and wait in there. She'll be home soon. I'm a little busy, so... This hilltop village is so high... Gosh, how could this happen? Why are they here instead of Hyo-seon? Will you stop drinking? Who are you? Why are you sleeping here? Kiddo? What is that thing? Did you steal that? What? No, of course not. Kiddo, you shouldn't do that. What did you steal and hide in there? Give it, let me see. Give it to me. It's not like that. You should brace yourself... I'm too old for that. Just give it to me! Why are you so strong? Kim Hyo-seon My mom's name is Kim Hyo-seon. Who? Kim Hyo-seon... Did I break your mom's urn? Yes, you broke your daughter's urn. Keep it a secret from your mom.

A LITTLE PRINCESS Aren't you coming in? Nice save! Are you okay? Thanks. We have a new student. Her name is... I'm Na Gong-ju from Cheongsong. In class, I was always first in the village, but I don't know how it'll be here in the city. I still hope we get along. Applause! Me! Me! Me! Miss! There's an empty seat here! Oh man... Off you go, Gong-ju. We need to help him from being last in class. All right, attention! Let's look at earth's rotation and revolution. So you were always first in class, huh? I was kidding. Kidding is good. Oh, dear! If you try to hit on dreamy U-ram again, that'll be your funeral day. You got that? You think he's dreamy? Are you pretending to be tough? You've got some attitude. Who are you to tell me that I've got an attitude? Everyone knows your mom died after running away from home. It means she was a delinquent. Isn't that it? Like mother, like daughter! Like... daughter! Same crap! Hwang-suk! You're bleeding! Are you okay? Try being cute with me again, and you'll nosebleed from both nostrils. Your nose is crooked! I like her more and more. It's hard getting used to living with kids. What's wrong? This! Look at this! And this too! You did this, right? Yes, I did that for you. Do you always compliment so threateningly? I need long strings to embroider. These are too short. Don't ever do something on your own around here. Got it? Okay... I've got to wash Jin-ju's diapers. Even her poop diapers are cute, right? What did I just tell you? What? She shouldn't use cloth diapers. I admit that her butt does look red like a monkey's. Diapers Freebie Take a freebie! Take some! Sure. Premium baby formula Thank you, thank you! Check us out. I'd like a refund. I thought my heart was going to explode. It'll be okay when you get used to it.

I've got to sell as much handkerchiefs as possible. Oh yeah! What? I forgot about visiting U-ram! Squeeze it harder! Can't you see what I'm doing? Harder! Harder! Jeez! Let me try!

Why are your eyes so dull-looking? Jin-ju kept me up all night. Your eyes are no different from mine. Someone kept me up too. You have a baby too? I'm a bachelor! Jeez! Well, it's not that... Could you give this to your teacher? Huh? That's my grandma's. I know. Don't open it and just give it to her. Okay, I won't ever open it. A camellia flower has blossomed in my heart. You're like a camellia flower, Ms. Park. Won't you please allow a tiger butterfly named Dong-gwang to land on one of your petals? What's with him? Who's that? I think it's Gong-ju. Gong-ju, wake up. Na Gong-ju! Gong-ju! I see you at home, and at school too. What? Gong-ju here, Gong-ju there! Gong-ju everywhere! Of course. I'm Gong-ju, who else would I be? The teachers took photos. Wow, look at that. I want to take these too. I wish I could eat these until my belly explodes. Gong-ju! Your nose is bleeding! - Huh? - Tissue, tissue... It's okay, I got some. Open this sugar pack for me. - You okay? - I'm fine. Did you get this from the school cafeteria? Is it good? You think I'm eating this because it's good? Why eat it then? I need to get my energy back up. You need to eat meat to get energy, not sugar. I have a lot of meat at home. Would you like some? You don't like meat? Are you a vegetarian? How could I say it with my mouth? Do you need an answer to know that? You are so clueless! If you don't say it, how am I to figure you out? Gong-ju, wait for me! Gong-ju! Na Gong-ju! Nice! Oh my... What was the point of getting her drunk? She can still read all our cards! My mind is as clear as day, and luck is on my side. Stop showing off and shut your hole. If I play for real, you'll need to bet your house on it. Are you going to talk about how you went to jail for gambling? Will you stop it? Yeah, I learned to tattoo and play cards too. Stop bluffing. Challenge me anytime you want and I'll take you on. Going somewhere? I've got to get home before Gong-ju comes home. You can't! Or spit out your $3 winning before you go! I wouldn't spit anything out even if I won 3 cents! What are you doing here? Did you see the frowns on their faces? You didn't see mine? I see it as clear as day. What is the matter with you? The corner store granny smokes! Don't you know what will happen if Jin-ju inhales that smoke in? I'm really tired after that drink! There you are. I went over your place. - Good afternoon. - Hi, Gong-ju. I milked this just now. - Thank you. - Sure thing. One more. - Thank you! - Sure. Ma'am, did Jin-ju get vaccinated? - What? - No, not yet. You know the pediatric clinic on the main intersection? The one that does free examinations. Yes, why? Didn't you hear they're vaccinating for free until this week? Get Jin-ju vaccinated before it's too late. But why is it free? I think something happened to the doctor's kid... They seem to have their reasons. Geum-sil, say bye to Granny. Ma'am, I'm off. Goodbye. Diaper freebie I wondered who it was. Oh my, oh my... I thought it was free. I'm so sorry. Free? Ma'am, taking something without paying is stealing. Don't you know what will happen to your grandchild if she steals? She didn't do anything wrong! I told her to do it! Could you take this instead? It's silver, pure silver! What are you doing? What's with the ring? I'll go to the police station! Take me instead! I didn't say anything about going to the police. I'm just telling you you shouldn't do this from now on. Granny, please get up. Let's go! What did she do so wrong? We weren't stealing, we just misunderstood! Now that it's cleared up, this won't happen again! - Grandma, let's go. - Okay, let's go. This way. Let's hurry along. Could you slow down? Family Writing is an expression of your mind. Through people's words, we read their thoughts and learn about the world. With the topic, "family," write your own story by next week. It's homework. Dismissed! Essay Assignment - Family I know what you did yesterday. "She did nothing wrong!" "I told her to do it! I'll go to the police!" Shut it. This place isn't your home! What is it that you want? Now we're talking. Tell me to die instead! I can't do it. That's all you can do for me? What's so hard about having just one meal? I'm only doing this for you. You'll have to take responsibility for me. Should we play Were You Fooled? Forget it. Let's get it over with. There's something that people are mistaken about me. I don't eat that much. Were you fooled? You look like you could eat a horse. I felt it when I transferred here this year. I could feel the way the boys looked at me. But I only care about you! Did your brain grow fat? Oh yeah, let's take a cute selfie. Cute selfie? Come closer. I'm asking you a favor as a girl. Then can I ask you a favor as a guy? Anything. Could I borrow your camera? Sure. Use it as much as you want and give it back when you're done. Let's take a cute selfie. Since you're so good-looking, it came out like art. Don't you think so? Like you said, I'll keep this as long as I want. You don't believe me? I'm a girl of my word. Let's go. Holy cow! Shouldn't guys be chivalrous? It hurts just as much if guys get hit too! Playing hard to get, eh? Grandma! Grandma! Hey, there. The arts and craft shop lady gave them to me. I asked for leftovers, but she gave me a bunch. You did good. But what's the point? I didn't sell anything today. Did you have lunch? Only Jin-ju had anything. But she didn't eat properly. She's been quiet all day. You must be really hungry. Not as bad as you. Here, eat this. Sure. $23, $24, $25, $26, $27... Wait a bit. When the sun sets, she'll sell us the leftovers at half price. - 2 rolls, please. - 2? - Thank you! - Thank you! It's good. The ingredients are from the market. Doesn't it taste a bit sour, though? We'll starve to death if you start questioning such things. You're so right! Oh my! Grandma! Sorry! Grandma, can't you knock? Hurry up! I'm about to burst! My gosh. How many times did we go already? That kimbap girl is going to be dead meat tomorrow! Grandma! What? I can't stop now! At gym class tomorrow... It's nothing. Just hurry out. You're eating ice cream nonstop. I'll eat just this. You always say that! You'll end up like your dad later. What about Dad? He's so cool! I want to be like him when I grow up. You're halfway there. I'll be like dad, and marry Gong-ju, and have kids like us... I mean, kids like Gong-ju! What is it with you? All you talk about is Gong-ju. He takes after me. Chasing after a pretty girl. Yeah, I'm like dad, so I like pretty girls. You little punk! Where are my shoes? I'm taking this to Gong-ju! Stop right there! That's enough! Drop the sharpener. You were going to give some to Mrs. Byun, anyway. I'm seriously worried for his future. Good, good! Move your body, slightly this way. The other way! That's it, good. You like taking photos that much? Come on, tell me. You look really handsome. Don't joke around. You're right, I was joking. You're not handsome. This is what I like about photos. What does that mean? Tell me with your pretty lips. Photos don't lie. It shows everything as they are. That's why I like photos. And that's why I like you. This is art, and so is this. This, this, and this too! Everything's art. They're incredible! Boys and girls, gym class is next. Who here has not brought their gym uniform? Aren't you going to buy your gym uniform? Forget it. I needed some break from looking after Jin-ju, anyway. Want to take my pants? Get out of here. Why are you being lazy? Go outside, hurry! So your wallet disappeared after the gym class? Yes, it had $30 for judo class... Has no one seen Gyeong-suk's wallet? Teacher's Office Is this what kids are taught at this school? Ma'am, please calm down. There's no evidence that Gong-ju took it. Evidence? Then are you saying that my child is lying? I hear she's quite poor. Look at her glaring at me. Mrs. Byun, it's here. Welcome, ma'am. I came with her because she seemed shocked. I see... Gong-ju, go outside. Grandma... Don't worry, go outside. Please sit down, ma'am. $30 can be a small or large sum depending on who you ask, but I can't let this slide for educational reasons. Why was a child carrying around $30? Oh my god! Whether my baby brings $30 or $3,000 to school, why does it matter to you? You call your kid, "baby"? Now that is weird. But you see, my grandchild said she didn't do it. Denying it won't make this go away! If she's got no parents, shouldn't you at least teach her properly? Honestly, how do you know if she's your runaway kid's kid or some adopted crass kid? What? What did you say? An adopted crass kid? My daughter gave birth to her, so she's my blood. Did you see her steal it? I'm asking if you saw her steal it with your own eyes! How dare a whore like you accuse my grandchild of stealing? "Whore"? Have you gone mad? Who are you calling a whore when you're raising a thief! What did you say? You bitch! Stop it, you hag! Let go of me! Gong-ju did not steal! She never would! Let go! Mrs. Byun! Please! Mrs. Byun! Stop! - Mrs. Byun! - Gong-ju didn't steal it! Grandma! Stop it! Stop that. You're going to pluck her hair off. Oh my god! Will you stop it? Isn't this her wallet? It is. This is hers. Where did you hide it? No one hid anything! She dropped it in the fields while playing hide-and-seek! Look here, say it again. A thief? A crass kid, huh? Let's all calm down and sit. Mrs. Byun? Oh no, it's time to feed her. - Miss, can we go now? - Yes. I left her bottle at home. Yes, please go ahead. I'm so sorry for today. Okay. - Let's go. - Okay. Goodbye. Take care. Goodbye. Okay. Good day. You must be worn out. She hurriedly left because of the baby. Could you do me a favor? I, uh... Could you have a meal with me? As a favor. Sure, we can have a meal, have some tea and even drinks. For real? But I want to make one thing clear. I'm not into older guys. I'm only into younger men. - Goodbye. - Thank you so much. What? I'm 24. I got a job right after I graduated so I can get married first before serving in the military. And I'm into women who are older than me. You're 24? - Yes. - You're 24, as in your age? Yes, I'm 24. I'll go ahead and reserve a nice wedding hall... I mean a restaurant and get back to you. I'll call you later. Thank you so much! Yes! Gong-ju! Gong-ju! Were you looking for me? Are you okay? You must be shaken from earlier. No. It's you who must be shocked. What for? Thanks for Gyeong-suk's wallet. You found it in my bag, right? They say everyone does it once. It's fortunate that you learned your lesson now than later. I want to apologize to you. I'm really sorry... for always showing you my bad side. Did you want to buy your gym uniform with that money? No. Grandma's glasses broke... Seeing her wear them makes me anxious that something bad is going to happen. You said photos don't lie, right? You've been photographed, so you shouldn't lie anymore. That's all you need to do. I'm not sure about that. About what? You said not to lie, so I'm being honest. What? Sorry for being indecisive. I couldn't choose between barbecue and sushi. When you eat meat, you feel like having fish instead, and when you see fish, you start longing for meat. Could I be indecisive once more? Sure you can. It's okay to be indecisive, and if you feel like... I don't think younger guys are a good fit for me. What? I won't be able to grow old comfortably if I'm with a younger man. That would be so tragic. You understand, don't you? Then let's walk our own paths. Pardon? You can continue to be indecisive towards me. As for me, I'll only go after you. That's decided then. Do eat up. I wish I could get some acupuncture therapy from him. I'll massage you until Jin-ju wakes up. No, it's okay. My body is like an old junk. Then I'll grease you up! Oh no, that patient hasn't been treated yet... That old junk is busted again. Drat... Oh dear. You'll be so bored without it. Should we do something fun? I can't play cards. I mean, I won't. Not that. Want to play Were You Fooled? Were You Fooled? Yes, you tell a secret one at a time, but you lose if it's a secret that others already know. That sounds interesting. Let's start quickly. There's a penalty. It wouldn't be fun without it. All right, let's begin. You said to throw away the cloth diapers, but I washed and put them away. Were you fooled? To the sound of the TV, I farted twice. Were you fooled? Today's lunch wasn't fermented soybean soup. I didn't wash my feet for 2 days! I didn't wash my hair for 3 days! My mom wasn't my real mom. Your daughter didn't give birth to me. She was my stepmom... You lost. Why? Because I already knew that. Then why did you take care of me... Did you hate your mom? She'd hurt me, but at least she didn't abandon me. When Dad passed away, she stood by us. Then you won't hate me too. I won't ever part with my granddaughters. I'll forgive you for losing, so can you forgive my daughter? Whatever Hyo-seon did to you, please forgive her. I beg of you. Were You Fooled is fun! I laughed a lot. Let's go to bed. Pediatric Clinic I, uh... I heard we can get free vaccination here. Fill this out. I came to vaccinate my baby. Do you have this? I heard that this one's better because there are no side effects. None of them do, but this isn't covered by insurance. But could I still go with that? I feel bad for trying to save a few bucks. Okay, please sit down. Could my sister get that shot too? She said it doesn't have side effects. None of the shots do. The free vaccination is a different kind. How is that fair? You're giving free shots just because they're bad ones? What's with you? It's not a bad shot, it's... Then give my sister the same shot! What's with you again! Just get it. It's free... Should we be grateful for everything that's free? I can't do that. If you give us the shot she's getting, then I'll be really grateful. Are you nuts? What's with you? How can a person be so careless with their baby like that? Grandma! That's Jin-ju! Jin-ju! It's okay, it's okay! Oh no. What do we do? I must've gone crazy! How could I have mistaken her for another baby! Is Jin-ju all right? Jin-ju, let's take a look at your stomach. How long has she been like this? What are those? When did those things appear? Call Dr. Jang at the General Hospital. Yes, ma'am. Baptist Hospital Is Jin-ju going to be okay? Her platelet count has gone up slightly, but it hasn't normalized so she'll need further treatment. She's still a baby. How did she... Doctor, what's the illness? It's... You heard him earlier. Her body isn't able to stop her bleeding. So she can't get hurt. You have to be careful when handling her. Am I right? That's right. How could there be such a weird illness? Eat up. Eat. Gong-ju! How did you know? I know everything that happens to you. ♪ She's always wearing a smile ♪ ♪ Always with a warm voice ♪ ♪ We'll always be together ♪ ♪ My beautiful you ♪ Wow, teach me that song. Geum-sil's always crying that I can't handle it. Will you be quiet? She finally calmed down. Okay, sorry. Attention, please. We have Mrs. Byun Mal-soon at the information desk. Byun Mal-soon? If you are her guardian, please come to the info desk. Isn't that your grandma? - Grandma! - Granny! Why are you here? What was that broadcast? Don't prank us like that! We don't play hide-and-seek anymore! - But... - Children. Where is her guardian? I'm the guardian. She said she was with her daughter. Where's your mom? I never said that. I said I came with my granddaughter! Granddaughter? Not this again... Then what's her name? Are you really mad? Don't ask me obvious things! Ma'am! But you can't even answer the obvious things! You didn't even know who you came with, or the patient's ward number. Do you remember everything? Do you have the names of everyone in the world in your head? I... You'll be presenting the essay you wrote about your family. Gong-ju, could you present yours? Come on. I'll give mine a read. There were 3 shaggy dogs living in the forest. Mommy and daddy shaggy dog, and their pup. One day, while looking for food for their pup, Mom and Dad were captured by a hunter in the forest. All alone, the pup cried and looked for her parents, and ended up going to a village. The hunter found the pup and said "I'll get you!" So the pup ran with all her might. Tired from all the running, she finally collapsed. Just then, a woman was passing by. The poor weaver had not eaten anything for days, unable to sell a single thing. When she found the pup, her eyes lit up. When she got home, she began to boil a pot of water. She calmed her growling belly and walked closer to the pup. Then she revealed what she was hiding. It was rice porridge that she made for the pup and herself. She fed the shaggy pup and said, "Shaggy dog, welcome to the family." Meh, pretty good. Just a tiny bit. Amazing! You did great. What happened? I thought you wouldn't see me ever again. What changed your mind? I've got to try everything that's good for my mind. Your mind? Stop nagging and just play! Is your mind fogging up? - It's your turn! - My goodness. My hand's numb, that's all! If you frown like that, bad things will happen here at home. - Smile! - Gong-ju! Smile, Jin-ju! Gong-ju, there's a fight! It's like a war! Oh my, oh my! Calm down, Grandma! - Stop it! - My goodness. I'll break both of your hands! How dare you cheat? You should be grateful that I'm playing with you even when you've got dementia. Don't bark at me! Dementia? How dare you? I should rip you apart. I should rip that mouth of yours! - Oh my gosh! - Stop it! Go ahead, bitch! - Grandma! Please stop! - Stop! You being so wicked is what got you sick! You all better be careful! This woman with dementia will stir trouble everywhere! This rotten bitch is scarier than death itself! No! I dare you to say dementia one more time! Let's go! Are you okay? Tell me. Will you be okay even though it's just you and Jin-ju? Answer me. Say something! Can you live by yourselves? We can't. You, Jin-ju and me... We can't! You saw it yourself. The blood on that woman. How could one keep a crazy woman close to a baby who should never bleed? We can be careful. It's not a problem. At this rate, I'd have to put on a diaper! How could I possibly take care of Jin-ju when I'm in that state? Then I'll take care of you and Jin-ju too! Aren't you tired? I have to put her to sleep. There's no other way. It's mammoth bread, and it's way bigger than rice puffs! Warm and freshly baked mammoth bread! Here, have some milk! There's always a way. Did you give up on your diet? You and I are meant to stuff ourselves. We need to eat first and then go on a diet. Are you kidding me? You can't lose weight like that. Do you know why Gong-ju's so thin even when she eats an extra bowl of rice? What? How should I know? It's because of the baby. She's on her feet with the baby all day. Baby? It's a sure way to lose weight. Be quiet! You'll wake the baby! I'll lose weight no matter what. Byun Mal-soon Even with the glasses, I can't see anything. You really didn't see my grandma? No, she didn't come. Yet she begged me to save her spot. What's wrong? There she is! - Gong-ju! Hey! - Gong-ju! How could this happen? We better go! How did she get this burn? Her grandma made a mistake. Is she okay? Let's get her admitted right away. Yes, Doctor. I told you that she doesn't stop bleeding easily, right? Yes, I remember. After a few tests, she'll need to stay here for a few days. Is she in a lot of pain? She'll be okay. You should've been careful. Can someone with dementia ever be careful? You should still get treated, for the kids' sake. - Dong-gwang. - Yes? Could you look for someone to take care of my kids? I need to find them a way to live before it's too late. Why are you out here? I heard you're on night duty, so I brought some snacks. A baby named Jin-ju was admitted today. Is it impossible for her to recover fully? There's hope at Johns Hopkins Hospital, since they've done plenty of research for this illness. They cannot afford proper treatment, and her grandma's got dementia. How could we not help even after knowing she could die even with treatment? - Honey... - I know! I shouldn't cause pain to others for my selfish reasons. Then you know better. But when I look at her, my heart beats so fast that I can't stand it. I can't help but think of adopting her and saving her life. To get rid of your guilt, you want to adopt a baby who looks like ours? Gong-ju, I'm here. Teacher asked us to visit you since you missed school. Is she going to expel me for missing school too much? No, you're not that lucky. Your hair looks well kept. Did you not sleep a wink? It's okay, I dozed off often. Go sleep on the bed. I'll look after Jin-ju. - I want to! - No, no, not now. Anything I can do to help? Anything except losing weight. Then could you watch her for just a bit? Dong-gwang, I know I'm asking a lot, but please take care of Gong-ju too. She loves you so much. You think she'll leave you? How could she not when Jin-ju's going away? Send Jin-ju away first... Then send Gong-ju away. Grandma! I'm back! Hi, Gong-ju. Thank you for looking out for us. When I grow up, I'll repay your kindness. Aren't you hungry? I'll get lunch ready. Grandma, wait a little bit. What? Give Jin-ju up for adoption to the doctor? Calm down and listen to me. They said she's going to need continuous treatment. You have to face reality. Say something! Do you agree with him? You two planned this... Eat by yourself! Don't ever come to our home! Don't cry. Eat well and get better soon. Then the 3 of us will live like before. It's not just the cost. Finding a compatible platelet to Jin-ju isn't easy. Dr. Jang's doing all the hard work. Apparently, he's covering the hospital fees, too. Otherwise, they wouldn't be able to afford such an expensive shot because they're not well-off. If it wasn't for Dr. Jang, Jin-ju wouldn't have made it. I know... Hot! You must be hungry. Have some food. She sure has a temper. Gong-ju, I'm packing all your favorites. You better eat them all. Oh no, I forgot the lunchbox. How could you eat all that? You didn't leave anything for the children! Why were you in such a rush... What's with the rush... - Oh gosh! - Hear me out. I got no business with you. I don't need to hear you out! Just hear me out! My goodness. Jeez! Should I call the police? What's all this ruckus? You said you've been to jail before. Isn't that what you said? You did a background check on me? You want to kill me now? You said you learned to tattoo there. You definitely said that. You've gone mad. Dementia completely ruined your head! Do me a favor, just this once. Please do this for me. Were you waiting for me? Grandma, I bought you glasses for cheap. Use these from now on. Grandma... Do what you think is best for Jin-ju. I know it all. I know you're just as sad... Na Gong-ju, Na Jin-ju Are you nuts? Why send her away? Don't send Jin-ju away! Thanks for this. With Jin-ju gone, I won't need it anymore. Gong-ju, this isn't like you. Don't be so cold-hearted. Forget it. I'll use it when I lose weight, so use it till then. In other words, she wants you to keep it. Take more photos of Jin-ju. When Jin-ju... comes back from treatment, watch her for 10 minutes. What do you mean? The doctor couple will be here to pick her up... I can't bare to watch her go. Missing Child Missing Child Jin-ju... Jin-ju! Jin-ju! You shouldn't be crying on such a happy day. You shouldn't be crying. I didn't expect to see you get married, but I wanted to be with you until you could walk... This worthless life is not on my side... You abandoned your own sister. How are you able to swallow your food? I can't help myself. I'm sick of you. Just go away like Jin-ju did! I'm sick of seeing you! Get out of my house! There's no reason for you to be here. We don't even share the same blood. You're like my mom! Yeah, I'm a bitch like your mom! No, she told me to leave too. She said I wasn't her daughter and that I should leave, but she never threw me out! I know that you won't throw me out! You just won't! Of course, I will! Just get out of here! Eat. You must be strong if you want to kick out a tough girl like me. Here, eat your meal. What's with you? You stubborn girl! Get to school, all right? Dong-gwang, please feed her. I'm begging you. Okay, hurry along. Why do you keep biting? It hurts even though my skin is old and scrawny. So imagine how painful it must be for her tiny hands... What are you shooting? Cutlassfish. Why? It's not even alive. I heard fish is good for the mind. Gong-ju? There's no school tomorrow, right? That's correct. I want to invite you to my home for lunch. Would that be okay? What is it? I'm okay, goodbye. Did you know Jin-ju's going to the US? It's called Johns Hopkins Hospital. They specialize in treating patients like her. We made that decision for her. What are you doing? What's that bag for? Where are you going? Can't you tell what's going on? You're practically forcing me out. What's with you? Let go, I refuse to live with someone I despise! You can't do that! Whether you like it or not, we must live together! Don't make me laugh! We're not even related! Out of the way! Do as you please! If you think you can leave, give it a try! Are you nuts? You're not letting me leave, yet you don't listen to me. You're crazy! Out of the way! I'll go live somewhere nice without you! Try to leave all you want. I'll stop you! Do it a hundred, thousand times! Let go! Stop it! Honey, Gong-ju's here. Come on out. Oh gosh... Our princess is in dreamland. So it took me a while to come out. Jin-ju. She's fast asleep. Wake up, Jin-ju. You should show your sister your room. I'd love for you to sleep on this bed, study on this desk, and become our family. It's windy today. Where have you been? The wind really messed your hair. Gong-ju, can you wash my hair? Sure. Does it feel good? Yup. The doctor said your head has turned black. What does that mean? It's been white for a long time. He said your head is black inside, just like how our teeth rots. But don't worry. Just like how we brush our teeth, I'll turn your head white again. What is it? Does it hurt? Gong-ju, do you know what makes my life the hardest? What is it? You. Because you're trying to do your best for me. Gong-ju. Yes, I'm listening. Could you... let me go now? Could you let me rest? I used a basin that had garlic in it to draw the water. Now my eyes are stinging. I better rinse your hair. Don't open your eyes or say anything. It'll be bad if the foam goes inside your mouth. I'll go and load these. Honey, here's one more. Gong-ju! Grandma's leaving, come on out! - Gong-ju! - Let her be. It's not like I'm going away for good. It's all right, let's go. I'll take Gong-ju and Jin-ju and visit you. ♪ She's always wearing a smile ♪ ♪ Always with a warm voice ♪ ♪ We'll always be together ♪ ♪ My beautiful you ♪ Gong-ju? Na Gong-ju! - Gong-ju! - Yes? Please concentrate. Could you read page 48? "Wind and Grass Flower" by Noh Won-ho. Leave that, I can do it. No, let me. This is fun. You really don't need to. Then can I just clean my room? Is that okay? Is it because you're sorry? Don't be sorry, or too arrogant. Let's just live comfortably. I'm just thankful. Then while you're at it, make it spick-and-span. Sure, don't worry. Oh my... - Hello. - Hi. Have you administered pills? I gave them lunch pills. What are you waiting for? I thought you were in a hurry. Come with me. Yes, I'm coming. Ma'am! She's not allowed to take walks. Where did she go? Mrs. Byun is gone! Mrs. Byun's gone! Ma'am! Yangsan Nursing Home Grandma, you were here? You are so pretty. What? Why do you cry with those pretty eyes? Have you lost your parents? I think I lost my grandma... No need to cry. I'll find her for you. My name is Mal-soon. I'm the baby of the family. Baby, what's your name? Gong-ju, Na Gong-ju. As in "princess"? That's a name I won't forget. ♪ She's always wearing a smile ♪ ♪ Always with a warm voice ♪ ♪ We'll always be together ♪ ♪ My beautiful you ♪ ♪ I can live without the sun ♪ ♪ I can live without the moon ♪ ♪ But I can't live without you ♪ ♪ My beautiful you ♪ I'm sorry... She's still not up? She didn't come out of her room all day yesterday? Gong-ju, let's eat... No matter how much I think about it, I better head back. The only thing I ask of you is to make Jin-ju all better. I'd be ever so grateful. I need to help Grandma so that she won't forget. I'll wash her hair and make it look good for the photo, and make sure she has enough needles on her pincushion. I'll welcome the 4 seasons, rain, snow, wind and sun, and build memories gradually. Until the day I see Jin-ju again, Grandma and I will stay strong. Your face is glowing like snow today. Gong-ju... Yes? What is it? Can we play Were You Fooled? Yeah? Sure. Then you go first. Do you see... the first drawer without a handle over there? I left something in there. It's for you. It's beside that. It's exactly the same as the one I made for Jin-ju. I had no idea. You looked so pretty in your sleep, so I kissed you. 5 times. I had no idea. One day, a child came along... carrying a baby on her back... And I was so happy. I always ate alone, slept alone, and lived in a daze. I was so happy that the child came to me. But I hid my feelings. Were you fooled? You lost. Why? I already knew how you felt. I lost... What's the penalty? This is a story that I made up. You have to listen to it until the end, even though it's boring. All right, go on. One day, while mommy and daddy shaggy dogs were out looking for food for their pup, they were captured by a hunter in the forest. The pup cried and looked for her parents. Tired from all the running, she finally collapsed. A woman who had not eaten for days found the pup at that moment, and her eyes lit up. When she got home, she began to boil a pot of water. She calmed her growling belly and walked closer to the pup. Na Gong-ju, Na Jin-ju Then she revealed what she was hiding. It was rice porridge that she made for the pup and herself. She fed the shaggy pup and said, "Shaggy dog, welcome to the family." Grandma, thank you for being my family. Hurry up! We can't be late today! I can't believe it. You're seriously wearing makeup? Let's go, we're late. Our Gong-ju is all grown up. It's amazing! She's really something. I found you. A princess in pearls. Are you all better? Sister... I was so happy when I traveled the world with my camera. But the happiest time of my life was when I was in Grandma's embrace. Thank you for bringing back Jin-ju into my life to fill my emptiness.
