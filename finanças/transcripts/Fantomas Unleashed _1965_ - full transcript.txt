FANTOMAS BREAKS LOOSE Present... ...arms. Present... ...sabres. In the name of the President and the authority invested in me... ...I declare you Knight in the Legion of Honour. Congratulations. Finish the ceremony. Less than a year ago... ...Fantomas terrorised the country. But a Frenchman never despairs. He knows that at crucial moments in history... ...a great person always takes charge of the situation. Bayard, Napoleon, Jeanne d'Arc. Yes, chief. A year ago you risked your life... ...on land and sea and in the air... ...to catch Fantomas. A little civil servant... ...so unsightly... ...a trivial typical Frenchman... ...with nondescript looks... ...suddenly appeared in front of the enemy... ...and chased him into his lair. That's France. Long live chief Juve. Again, congratulations, chief. In spite of the emotions that overwhelm me... ...I would like to share this honour with journalist Fandor and his intrepid fiancée. Because your chest is as worthy of this reward as mine. Thanks to us, Fantomas hasn't shown his face for a year. Thanks to this bond between police and press... ...Fantomas has been eliminated forever. Excuse me, chief, it's urgent. One moment. Hold this for a second. What's this? CONGRATULATIONS FANTOMAS SEE YOU SOON! CENTRE FOR SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH Hello, Professor Marchand. Fantomas. Please accompany me. Don't hit him on the head. Red alert. Get your guns. Close the doors. Shoot. Come on, take him along. Is it happening again? I want news and you come up with Fantomas. He kidnapped Marchand. - The witnesses are adamant: Nobody has seen Fantomas. - Yes, because the others are dead. Soon I'll be accused of panic mongering and demoralising the police. I can already hear Juve. - It's a scandal. I would like to deny the allegations made by an infamous journalist... ...who's spreading false rumours. Look. This journalist, who I made the mistake of trusting, hasn't changed a bit. He only has one goal: media attention... ...and better sales, by scaring honest citizens. So you're sure Marchand hasn't been kidnapped by Fantomas? Absolutely sure. And this is why: The sound's gone. But... Don't resist. Out of the way. What's happening? This is a pirate broadcast. Call the TV tower. Fantomas. - Yes, it's me. Fantomas. - Great. My friend Fandor didn't lie. I kidnapped Professor Marchand. Well, what did I say? Thanks to him, I can create a horrible weapon... ...that will remain a surprise. A bit of patience. Soon, I'll rule the world. Get the picture back. The failure sign. APOLOGIES FOR THIS UNPLANNED INTERRUPTION INTERMISSION THE BROADCAST WILL BE RESUMED SHORTLY There's no more picture. It's not true. I'm cracking up. Amazing. Chief... On behalf of the authority invested in me... ...and on behalf of the President... ...I declare you Knight... ...of the Legion of Losers. We had bad luck. - You had great luck. Enormous luck. You were knighted just before that broadcast. If I'm... - What's that? If I'm not worthy of this honour, I'm always prepared... ...to return it. Come on, chief. I want you to show us that you're worthy. The fate of humankind is at stake. - We're a bit tight. If Fantomas finds a scientific brain more important than all the gold... ...you must prove that the combined brains of our police... ...are worth more than billions. You have a brain, don't you? Use it then and re-evaluate your approach. Re-evaluate your approach. The days of petty crime are over. Use your brain. Show that you have one. How would you look if Fantomas was caught by just anybody? I'll tell you: you'll look like a loser. What do you want? I'm here for the briefing. - Too late. Go. A huge display of power to scare the enemy is old-fashioned. These are the days of secret agents, of gadgets. What was that? Nothing, I just wondered what 'gadgets' are. A gadget. A secret invention to surprise your enemy. Don't you ever go to the movies? Never mind. A little demonstration. Bertrand, threaten me with your gun. I wouldn't dare, chief. - It's an order. Threaten me. A strange feeling. And look. Almighty. That's a gadget. If this had been real, you'd be dead now. I understand. - No, you don't. Sit down. Explanation. Projector. This raincoat gadget is equipped with an artificial arm and a fake hand. Do you hear me? - Yes, yes. The movement of raising a hand transfers the same movement... ...to the artificial arm, from bottom to top. You seem at the mercy of the enemy... ...but suddenly, near your stomach... ...the real second hand appears and fires the gun. Do you understand now? You, help me get out of this raincoat. Quickly. And for the slow ones among you... For the slow minds... ...a detailed explanation of this device. Pay attention. And look. And from behind. To the back, to the front... Understood? Everything clear? That was it then. And look. Thanks. Now, for the second gadget, also my own invention. A pocket submarine. - Not at all, a rocket. No, a cigar. - A cigar? A cigar gun. I always carry one. That's the tobacco. That's the gunpowder. That's the timer and the ignition. Using the cigar band, you set it to go off 15 to 20 seconds after you light it. In emergencies, you can let it go off by biting the mouthpiece. Demonstration. Come here, Bertrand. I'll show you how I, with my hands on my back and smoking... ...eliminate an enemy who keeps me at gunpoint. Give me a light. Look. Careful. I'll set it to 15 seconds. 15 seconds. Count down starts. Stand back, fool. Wait: 7, 8, 9... Keep your cool, gentlemen. Sit down. I want a relaxed police corps. Relaxed. Not like... Relaxed. Body control by a strong mind. Psychosomatic. Relax and watch. Like this. Relaxed, relaxed. Stay relaxed. I'd like to thank Professor Lefèvre... ...for his presence at this press conference. Professor, could you answer the... ...questions that will be asked? With pleasure. Who wants to ask a question? Go ahead. If I understand correctly, you were doing similar work to Professor Marchand? Yes, indeed. In the margin of all our scientific work... ...Professor Marchand and I are both specialised in hypnosis. We're both working on a device... ...that emits a telepathic beam... ...that allows you to control the thoughts of other people... ...and to command them from a distance. But if you succeed... ...you could turn everybody who's listening, into a robot. Yes, indeed, but don't worry. We have only good intentions. But Fantomas' intentions... Yes, with such a weapon he could... ...dominate the entire world. Don't worry. Without the results of my research, Professor Marchand... ...cannot achieve a break-through. Now, Fantomas will kidnap him as well. This will be a disaster. No, that would be great. - What? You gave me an excellent idea. We have to provoke Fantomas. - But how? Leave that up to me. Hello, sir. Do come in. I've seen you before. I know you. I'm certain. I'm bad at remembering names. Professor Lefèvre. No, no. I'm Professor Lefèvre. I could be as well. If you'd want. - But how? Come have a look. Come. Do you see? Do you see any similarity? - It's incredible. But still... ...as simple... ...as this. Look. And look. And look, Professor. This is really incredible. But, please don't take offence, young man. These kinds of jokes don't amuse me anymore. I'd never make fun of you, Professor. I only want to save you a lot of hassle and maybe even... ...keep world peace. World peace? Shall we continue this conversation in my study? You're burdening me with a huge responsibility. It's the only way. - If I understand correctly... ...you want Fantomas to believe he's kidnapping Lefèvre... ...while it really is Fandor. - Exactly. Because he can defend himself. - And Fantomas will be caught. Good idea. Can I call you Hélène? - Of course. I have to tell the chief that. - No, not at all. He refuses any idea that's not his. - You think? It must be our little secret. - Our little secret? And with a man like you, it has to work. - That's true. As you see, Fantomas is not the only one who can disguise himself. I'd like to beat him with his own weapons. Let me take your place in the express train to Rome. Why? Professor Marchand, as you said yourself... ...is of no importance to Fantomas without you. So he'll do anything to kidnap you. That would be very funny. No, believe me. I know him. Let me take your place. Danger's part of my job. I'll be the bait. If Fantomas buys it... ...we can catch him. BOARDING SCHOOL FOR SECONDARY EDUCATION Did you see the supervisor look at us? Stop there. You'll be expelled. Who played Fantomas? - Michou. But how then? - He was sitting on Jacques' shoulders. What is it? - He's been expelled again. He's been expelled as well. What a disaster, a little brother like that. - But I came second in gymnastics. Get in. We're going to Rome tomorrow. If I leave him at home, he'll destroy the entire street. Let's take him to Rome. - And then? Travelling is educational for young people. Right, Michou? Gentlemen, Fantomas will use the conference in Rome... ...to start his big offensive. But what is his aim? To kidnap Professor Lefèvre. So what's our mission? To guard Professor Lefèvre. Once Fantomas shows up, we can easily arrest him. But don't forget what ploys he's capable of. Projector. Last year, thanks to masks of which we now know the secret... ...Fantomas was able to commit his crimes. Not just disguised as Fandor... ...but also as me. You'd swear that was me. As you know, Lefèvre takes the express train to Rome tonight. So don't trust anybody and check who's who. Yes, check who's who. - Who's whosewho? Would you have a light? Permesso? Attenzione. Everything alright, chief. And Fandor, our journalist? Fandor, our journalist. He's typing in his compartment. Watch Lefèvre. I'm getting changed. - What did you say? Watch Lefèvre. I'm getting changed. Permesso? Get up. Arrivederci, bon appetita. Second round. Speak. Everything goes according to plan. The scientist's in carriage 27, compartment 33. Continue surveillance. Here are your instructions for Rome. Second round. And? It's going fine. Fantomas will definitely come to kidnap me. I'm so hot. What a hassle. Stay here. Wait for me. You're cute as a senior citizen. Now I know I'll never leave you. Second round. Almighty. That's true love. - Why? When I kiss you, I hear bells. Ooh la la. What is it? - The women. Are you married? Nice to be the alibi, but I'm starving. When will we eat? Help me remove the make-up. Join me in the corridor. Strange, strange. Close the door. My cameras. - Are you coming? Quiet. Second round. This table, please. To the next carriage, quickly. Open up. - He must already be asleep. Open up. - That's not allowed. Shut your mouth, open the door. Gone. The professor has disappeared. Gone. Kidnapped. Through the window, by Fantomas. Or he fell out. - Fantomas is on the train. High, low, in the corridor... - Quiet. I'll confess everything. I already know. Fandor is in the compartment next door. He kidnapped the professor. So Fandor's not Fandor. Fandor's not Fandor. - Yes, he is. Don't be stubborn. Fandor's Fantomas. Fantomas is wearing a mask, like last year. A mask of Fandor. And now he's having a nice dinner. - No, he's not. I'll explain. Let me, please. Professor Lefèvre is really Fandor. Fandor is Fantomas. Careful. Arrest him. It's Fantomas. Get him. Nobody gets out. It's Fantomas. Arrest him. It's Fantomas. What's with him? It's Fantomas. Arrest him. This time, I'm not buying it. This is Fantomas. Take the mask off. He's mad. What are you doing? Don't you recognise chief Juve anymore? Villain. Stop there, scoundrel. Now look. What are you doing? Whose shoes are those? They're mine. Do you call that working? I'll call the Director right away. Do whatever you want. What are you doing here? I'm looking for hidden mikes in Professor Lefèvre's room. Which Professor Lefèvre? - Fandor. Where's Bertrand? - Under the bed. Where are you? - I'm here. And? - No mikes, chief. Don't call me 'chief'. Interpol's next door to protect the scientists. I'm here incognito. No microphones and no chief. Nothing. Where's Fandor? - In the bathroom. Is he ready? Almost. - Almost ready. How are you? - Just my moustache and my glasses... ...and I'm all yours. - Perfect. Why didn't you say that in the train? We could have worked on the idea... ...and we would have had Fantomas already. Thanks to you, we can finally get to work, chief. Now we have to provoke Fantomas. I'll be watching you. At 11 o'clock, we're going to visit the monuments of Rome. Don't stand out. We're incognito. What does Fantomas want? - To kidnap Professor Lefèvre. And where is he? In Paris. - No, here. It's Fandor. Fandor alias Lefèvre. - Yes, chief. Don't say 'chief', say 'father'. At this moment, Lefèvre, alias Fandor, acts as bait. He acts as bait. If Fantomas shows himself... ...he'll throw himself upon Professor Bait, I mean Lefèvre. And we throw ourselves on him. Understood? - Yes, father. Pay attention. Keep an eye on Fandor. Stop it. Oaf. What are they saying? - No idea. Well, what are they saying? You have to baptise him, I believe. - Baptise? I can't baptise. Lefèvre. Hello, sir. Let me help you. Thanks. - At your service. Professor, would you make a statement on TV? No, not one statement. Please, a couple of words. - Don't be pushy. Do you believe in flying saucers? But of course. I'm sure we're surrounded by Martians. He makes a complete fool of me. Why don't they show themselves more often? - Because... I think... they're afraid of journalists. It's not true. I have to go there. I have to go to Rome. I'm going. I'm the professor's photographer. - No photographers inside. And what about freedom of the press? - This isn't politics, it's science. I have to get in. - I'm sorry. Ladies and gentlemen, I believe everybody's here and we can start. Please sit down. This way, Professor. I'm happy to be able to say hello to our respected colleague Lefèvre. Mister chairman, I'm sorry I'm this late... ...and that I lost my voice. The train. I caught a cold on it. I'm very sorry. My secretary. Ladies and gentlemen... Allow me to first pay homage to... ...to our poor colleague Marchand... ...who was so cowardly kidnapped by Fantomas. I hereby open the 14th international, scientific congress. Would you like to say something? Colleagues, I proudly say... ...that we convened again to clarify our ideas... ...and to report the results of one year of research... ...in the context of scientific progress. Thank you for showing up in such large numbers... ...and for appreciating the importance of this event. The results are so convincing... ...that I suggest we convene on a yearly basis. It's very simple. You get Professor Lefèvre out of the congress room. You kidnap him and I take his place. That way he won't be missed. Then we'll have the real professor... ...and I can steal the documents. In peace and quiet. Go ahead. Ladies and gentlemen... We know the true power of science... ...and we must together fight inhumanity... ...with an international treaty. You know what you have to do... ...and you tell Professor Lefèvre he's wanted on the phone. The express train from Paris arrives on track 3. Martians... I'll give them Martians. Cab. Chairman, I'd like to say a word. - Go ahead. Personally, I feel, respected colleagues.... ...that we shouldn't allow this Fantomas bogey man to bother us too much. I totally agree. Phone call for you, Professor. From New York. And I think, respected colleagues... ...that we should try our utmost... ...to make sure Fantomas doesn't endanger other scientists. Phone call from New York. - But we should not take any initiatives... ...in what is mainly a police matter. Thank you for agreeing with me... ...and we should not waste time on matters... ...that are not strictly scientific. No objections? Then I suggest we proceed to the order of the day. This way, please. You can call there, Professor. As you see, Professor: All resistance is futile. Would you follow these gentlemen? Grab him. Careful, there he is. Open up. Kick the door in. Get up. Quickly. What are you waiting for? Get that man. Can't you see he's not Lefèvre? Hands in the air. And, Pandor? Good that I was here, isn't it? - Thank you. Where's Hélène? Still outside. Fantomas, this time you won't escape. No, chief. I'm Fandor. Don't you recognise me? Are you starting that again? Get him. That was Fantomas. I'd like to say something. - Go ahead, Professor Schmitt. Gentlemen, Fantomas. He's wearing my mask. There he is. Get him. That's Fantomas. No, that's not Fantomas. Come. Did they recognise you? - Get in. Why is Lefèvre going all of a sudden? Whose car is this? Fantomas' car. - Don't make fun of me. And why do you use that voice? - Because I'm Fantomas. Is it far to the congress? - No, we're there. I'll get you, Fantomas. There he is. That's Fantomas. Give me your mask. - A madman. A madman. My briefcase. Police. But gentlemen, the cab's taking off with my briefcase. Thank you, gentlemen. That was the real professor. He's being kidnapped. Relax, relax. PSYCHIATRIC CLINIC The first fake professor was Fandor, the journalist. The real one stayed in Paris. The second fake professor looked like the real one, but no. Not at all. That was Fantomas. In other words... - Excuse me. In other words... The second fake professor, Fantomas... ...jumps the first one, the journalist, and they start to fight. A fight. - I turn around... ...and hit them with my third hand. - Third hand? The hand on my chest. Of course, his third hand. - Don't make it even more complicated. Excuse me. - Alright, doctor. Then, I was hit on the head. On your head again? I say. And I see three Professors Lefèvre. The real one was there too now. But I threw myself on the real Lefèvre Do you understand? Yes, yes, yes. - I doubt it. I'm following the third doctor. The third scientist, I mean. No, Fantomas. I threw myself on the real one, thinking he was the fake one, but he was the real one. That explains everything. - And that's how, in Rome... ...the highest French police officer is in a nuthouse. A victim of his work. Hello, Professor. Chief, I don't get it anymore. Everything indicates that he's really the highest police officer of France. Bunch of losers. - But Professor... Listen, my car is at your disposition. In front of the door. Including a driver. No, that way. Come along. No, that way. I'm chief Juve. Call inspector Bertrand. I'm chief Juve. Call inspector Bertrand. What a job to explain who you were. Me, the highest police officer of France. Thought to be a crazy man. If the press find out about it... - Chief.. In our business, it's better they think you're crazy than a loser. But they wouldn't put you in a straitjacket. - That's true. Now you have to make a choice. With me, everything's simple. You just have to say 'yes' or 'no'. If you accept my proposal, you'll see your little brother back alive. Why the blackmail? Why so evil? What's evil, what's good? For me, good is what I want. What I long for. You're free. But talk to nobody about what you now know. Your brother's life and your friends'... ...depend on your silence. So, think well. Sit down. Grab a pen. - I don't hear anything. Did you install it correctly? - Two microphones. I don't hear a thing. There she is. She's pacing up and down. Not anymore. INVITATION MARQUIS ROSTELLI INVITES YOU TO A COSTUME BALL ON SEPTEMBER THE 27TH IN HIS PALACE She's stirring. Filling up her bath. Come in. This was just delivered for you. - For me? Are you sure? - Yes, miss. Put it on the bed. 'Put it on the bed.' What's that? - I don't know. She's unwrapping something. She's unwrapping and unwrapping... - But what? I don't know. It's still wrapped. Who is it? - Me. What happened? Where were you? - Can't I even leave for five minutes? I've been looking for you for an hour. What's happening? - They're arguing. Arguing badly. Where were you? And where's Michou? With friends who were going to Paris. Where's Michou? - No idea. In Paris, with friends. Yes, in Paris. Oh dear, what a fight. We're not married yet. You're driving me nuts. - There's something. You changed. A strange woman. Get lost. - Where were you this afternoon? Do you want to know? You should have let that stupid Juve follow me then. Oops. - What are they saying? None of your business. Come on. I'm fed up. I'm going. I don't want to hurt your feelings, but your fiancée is acting weirder and weirder. I agree. Look. An invitation from Marquis Rostelli. - Oh, that's very strange. No more personal initiatives. From now on, I'm in charge. Thank you for coming, Hélène. Masks on. Quick, put your masks on. Ready? Did you betray me? - No, I swear. Oh well, what does it matter? I knew you'd spill the beans. Or that you'd be followed. That was part of my plan. Your friends are trapped here. There's nothing you can do for them. Are you sleeping? With one eye. - He might end up kidnapping her. This time we've got him. Later on, you start doing the polonaise. - And then? Grab his hand and pull him with you. - Alright. It's time. We're doing the polonaise. Understood? What are you doing? - That's Interpol. Let's surround him and grab his hand. - Alright. What else do you want from me? You'll find out soon enough. What's wrong? - Interpol has been electrocuted. Darling, darling... - Not now, come. Quickly. Faster, faster. Careful. Stop. Come along. Good heavens. Bertrand? What's happening? Excuse me, I dreamt I was being hit. - Look. Look. We've been drugged. We're in trouble. - No, we're in Fantomas' place. Thanks, I didn't know that. Michou must be here too. - Michou? Did Fantomas kidnap him as well? I couldn't say anything. He would have killed him. Now, things look much better. This is not the moment. - How do we get out of here? There's always this. Taste it. I'm not thirsty. - Taste it. It's nice. Very nice. - Give it to me. Very nice. Now let's look around. No, not anymore. What's that? Televisions. - I can see that. And that? What's that? Don't touch anything anymore. Hello, my friends. I'll join you in a moment. Strange, not one window. Indeed. We must be high in the mountains. My ears are singing. Sharks. - Unbelievable. At least we know that the exit isn't upstairs. I hope you're enjoying yourselves, friends. My headquarters are located on the slope of a submerged volcano. At the location of a destroyed city. That should appeal to the romantic in you, Hélène. I needed this peace and quiet... ...to work on my experiments without being disturbed. I need your cooperation, gentlemen. Please follow my assistants. Walk. Take it easy, dear Hélène. Remember you'll soon see your little brother again. I don't need to say anything. Alright. Get on. You too. What's this? Hélène, your brother's life and your friends'... ...is no longer in your hands. Why are you so cruel? Cruel? This is scientific research. An experiment I've been dreaming of for a long time. Gentlemen... You're in good company. Professor Lefèvre has joined Professor Marchand. Under these domes and under my orders... ...the elite of the international scientific world is working. It's now possible to keep an animal's head alive, separated from the rest of its body. I want to apply that experiment... ...to the human body. You will experience something extraordinary. And even if this will be your last day... ...know that you've been... ...a pioneer of a new science.. Patience. I'll be with you in a moment. Imagine, those heads without bodies... ...that tell us their thoughts and their innermost feelings. How gruesome. You can stop the experiment. - How? Ever since Lady Beltham passed away... ...I've felt the need for company. I'd like you to be that company. And I'd like you to come and live with me of your own free will. I'll give you time to think about it... ...while I'm going to get your little brother... ...to prove that I always... ...keep my word. Don't be so impatient. The boss will be here soon. Tell me, old chap... - What? I can see you have a good heart. - Shut up. But it's a matter of sympathy, of telepathy. Stop it. You can't refuse a soon to be victim of science a last cigar, can you? You'll even get champagne. And dancers. My own cigars, in this case. Come on, help me. Also one for you. One for you. one for him... ...and one for me. I set them to 19 seconds. 13, 14, 15... What's wrong? You look pale. And so does he. Look at each other. Careful, a guard. Got him. He bought it. Come on, untie them. - Let's join them. Untie them and then we get out as well. My dear Bertrand. You didn't expect this, did you? We didn't waste our time. This is a telepathy canon. Unfortunately, it only has a range of 14.50 meters. Better then nothing. - It works perfectly. We worked very hard. Look. Come here. Faster. Faster. Stop. Give us your gun. Slowly. Come on. Come here. Step up onto that. Come on. Climb on. Close your eyes and fall asleep. Incredible. Now we have to free Hélène. - Come on. And, Hélène? What have you decided? Drop your weapons. Thanks to the work you forced us to do... ...we now have a weapon that leaves you powerless. Look. Come here, friends. Come here. Drop your weapons and walk away. Faster. Don't shoot. I want him alive. There. Fantomas. - Let's go. Look, I have an idea. Come. Come, chief. - Get in. Faster. It's not possible. - It's not? Look at the meter. It goes to 200. Faster. You can never do it. - Hold tight. We'll take a short cut. To the right. Faster, faster. Come on, straight to the left now. Another 20 meters and he's within reach. - This time he won't make it to his plane. Unbelievable. A plane. Quick, we can get him. Quickly, quickly. Police. I'm confiscating this plane. Follow that car. Faster. Come on, faster. - Hands off. Closer. Less than 15 meters. - Why? So I can force him to land. A bit closer. Don't do that. Closer. It can't fail again, like last year. Open the door. Are you crazy? What are you doing? You're ruining the door. - So what? You could fall. At least use a parachute. Here, put this on. - Hurry, hurry. Faster. Closer. You're not wearing your parachute. A bit closer still. - Chief, your parachute. You're forgetting your parachute. No, that's a backpack. I don't care. Not one bit. - Come on, chief. I have to get him. Help. Fandor. I can't fly. Wait a moment. I'm coming. Hold me tight. Hold on. I'll get you Fantomas. You won't escape punishment. Fantomas, I'll get you. The footage of the free fall, shot for the first time in wide-screen... ...was made by flying camera man Jean-Jacques DUBOURG.
