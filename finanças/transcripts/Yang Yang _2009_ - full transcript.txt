You can file an appeal within 20 days. Have you taken any medication recently? I sprained my ankle last month. The doctor gave me some medication. But I showed him the list of prohibited meds. Yang-Yang. Think carefully. Did you take any cold medicine? What about Ohinese medicine? That might influence the result. Do you want to re-test? Of course! We have to be certain about this. - Perhaps... - No need. What? I took them. I took prohibited drugs. Zhang Xinyang! Yang-Yang! Have you looked around for her? Are you sure you searched everywhere? Wait. It seems that... I think she walked in. Yang-Yang. Wait. She just came home. That's alright. Take it easy. I'll ask her. You stay there. Okay. Bye. What do you think you're doing? What happened? Won't you tell me? Talk to me. You must be exhausted. Right? I won't ask you what really happened. I'll keep Dad from asking too. But you have to promise... You won't leave me. Ok?

By the way. Dad is busy at school. He couldn't make it. And he hopes you'll understand. Don't make excuses for him. I know he doesn't want to see me. I know I deserve it! How can you say that? He misses you. - How can you think that? - Okay. I know. I'll be right back. Nervous? I'm worried about my pronunciation. You're not French after all. You're a Taiwanese hotty.

She can't speak French. And where am I supposed to find a French girl? Give me some time. I can have someone teach her the lines. - You're putting me on the spot. - I'm really sorry. How do you expect me to make the day? - Sorry. - Okay. Forget it. Never mind. Here's what we'll do. Oome here. Next take. We'll pick up the pace. Yang-Yang. Open the door. You see her...

(Taiwanese) Excuse me. Hello? Ming-Ren. Olass is over. I went to class. Just like I promised. Alright. You got it. Zhang Xinyang. Take a seat. Thank you. How do you do? This is our director Laurent from France. I'm producer Kuo. I want to clarify first... While Yang-Yang is half-French. She can't speak French. That's ok. The director says that this character doesn't need to speak French. In that case... there's no problem. I think it's great. This character is just like you. Don't you think so? Not really. I wouldn't go looking for my father. Grab a bite? Hello? Yes... I have to check with Yang-Yang first. I'll call her and then call you back. Ok. Thanks. It's producer Kuo. He said the French director likes you. But he's leaving tomorrow. So he wants to meet you tonight. I think it's good. We're doing great today. I'm not sure. What do you mean? I think the story sucks. You mean... A Eurasian looking for her father? So boring. You're afraid? Of what? You're running away. You're not me. How can you say that? And why can't I run away? It's just a start if you wanna be an actress. Ok. Ok what? Whatever you decide. I trust you. Really. Ok. I'll call him later. Oareful. - Hello. - Table for two? No. I'm here to meet a Mr. Kuo. Mr. Kuo. Second floor please. Thanks. Second floor please. Excuse me. I'm here to meet Mr. Kuo. Yang-Yang! Don't you look gorgeous? That's why you're my agent. Oome in. Mr. Kuo! - Ming-Ren. You're here. - Hello. Mr. Kuo. Finally! What took you so long? This place is hard to find. We got lost. Where's the director... He left already. Early flight tomorrow. So he went back to rest. I see... So... Don't worry. Basically... all the Taiwanese casting... is up to me. Have a drink? Oome on! Have some! Thanks. - Will you drink with me? - A little. Just a bit. Thank you. - You're late. So bottoms up! - Ok. Bottoms up. Thanks. - Yang-Yang. - Yes? The story you told this afternoon. About seeing the photo in the hospital. The director thinks it's good for the film. If you can elaborate. We want to put it in the script. Of course... That's only if you agree to play the character. Of course we're interested. As long as it fits her schedule. Actually I have several projects in the works. And... I think Yang-Yang is really special. So... Go for it! Ok. Have some more. - Okay... - Oome on! Thanks. Mr. Kuo. Don't mention it. Waiting for you is my pleasure... Oheers to you. Bottoms up! - Want more food? - No. We've eaten. Oareful. I'm fine. Be careful. Yang-Yang. Where do you live? Are you drunk. Mr. Kuo? Not one bit. Oan I give you a ride? No need. It's not far! I need some cigarettes. Want anything? No! Ming-Ren! He's unbelievable... He insists on sending me home. Say no if you don't feel like it. I've got some work to do. You're not a kid anymore... You can handle yourself. Right? But he's so gross. You can take care of yourself. Got any money? Only 200 NTD. Grab a taxi if you don't want to go with him. Oall you tomorrow. I have to go. You're so beautiful. Please stop over there. You're getting out? My house is nearby. You take care. Just stop right here. Oan you pick up that girl over there? Here... - Keep the change. - Thanks. Just pretend you're passing by. Thank you. How are you doing? Hungover? Here. I didn't use it. The producer called to ask about your fee. Do you have any ideas? Or... Should I make an offer? You decide. I told you... I trust you. Yeah. Ok. In that case... I'll have the script translated into Ohinese. Then we'll take it from there. I'm warmed up. Your dance partner is late. I know. But I wanna dance with you first. Alright. Let's go over what we did last time. Your dance partner is on his way. I have to go now. Am I too early? Don't sweat it. - It's been a long time. - How are you? Getting by. Shawn! Oome out here. Let me introduce you two. Senior. Junior. Junior to me by a year. Hello sir. Give him a JD and water. Not tonight. Straight. No chaser. - Why the change? - It's nothing.

But I go in the military next week. I'm worried it'll be too late. I'll tell her as soon as I can. Are you and her together? No. No. What's the matter? Will you give me the number or not? I told you. I've got nothing to do with her private life. Oome on. Let's have a drink. Will you give it to me or not? Sorry. But I can't do that. Did you fuck her? No. I just told you. Have a drink.

How about you? I... Pretty good. I think. Excuse me. The director wants to speak to you. I can go by myself. Thanks Director. Good job. You too. We're about to shoot the last scene. When you enter your dad's house... You'll find he has already passed away. You'll see the photos he secretly took... ...because he's loved you for so long. I hope when you see the photos... you'll think of your real father ...very fondly. I hope you can release your true feelings. But I've never experienced that. You'll know what it is. Give it a try.
