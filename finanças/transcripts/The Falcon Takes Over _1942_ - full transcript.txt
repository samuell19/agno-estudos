[instrumental music] [orchestral music] [cars honking] Never mind, bud. I'm just waiting for someone. Yes, sir. Would you mind pulling ahead a little, please? Okay. [all laughing] [laughing continues] [car door closes] [engine revs] Hey, you know anything about that dive in there? No. Just saw you talking to the doorman. I am talking to you but I don't know you. What I mean is...I've only been into that place once, buddy. Ever know of a girl named Velma in there? Brother, if she's your girl, I don't wanna know her. I just asked you a simple question. Alright, so I never met a girl by that name. She worked in the place that used to be here five years ago. I ain't seen her for five years. - Five years is a long time. - Yeah, it is. She promised to wait for me if she is some place. - You don't know Velma. - No, I don't know Velma. And it'll be healthier for the both of us if we never meet. Just a moment, sir. Club rules, evening clothes only. Sorry, sir. You can't go in there. ♪ The first time I saw you ♪ ♪ I knew at a glance ♪ ♪ I was meant to be yours, yours alone ♪ ♪ As I stood before you my heart seems to dance ♪ Looking for somebody? Yeah, Velma. Does she work here? Velma? There's no Velma around here. ♪ As I look in your eyes ♪ - I am sorry, but... - Where's the boss's office? - Maybe he can tell me... - I'm sorry. The doorman should've explained. We don't admit anyone... Where is the boss's office? Back there. But you won't be able to see Mr. Montgomery. [women screaming] [screaming continues] [gunshots] [screaming continues] [clamoring] [male #1] 'Move!' [male #2] No, you don't. - Keep going, pal. - Yes, sir. I wanna get out alive but did you eliminate some competition back there? - What makes you think so? - Skip it. I ain't curious. You'll live longer. I guess I better drop you now. I got a date. You wouldn't want it with an angel, would you? No, sir. - Then keep on driving. - Yes, sir. [male #3] 'Alright. Break it up. Break it up. Come on.' - Allow me. - Oh, thanks. Hmm, the great Falcon. Haven't seen you for a half a dozen murders. - What're you doing here? - I was gonna ask you? - I ain't night clubbing. - Mind if I join you? - I certainly would. - Thanks. Bates, take everybody in a place. - Why, chief? - A murder's been committed. And I'd like to find out something about it. - Do you mind? - No, not at all, chief. I thought you gave up detecting and dames since you got engaged. I did, but my fiancee's out of town. I have some free evening. Why, Homer Bilkie! I didn't think you'd show up. - You don't know Homer. - Yeah, madam. I think you must be mistaken. My name is, uh, Dittenfrisk. Fingerprints? They're checking on it downtown. - What do you say, doc? - Broken neck. - What? - He's right. - You mean, he wasn't shot? - He was held by the shoulders and shaken so hard, his neck was broken. You can't do that. You can argue about that with the corpse. - Good day, gentlemen. - Cheerio. - I got all the dope, boss. - Alright. I get it from the bartender. A palooka comes in and ask for a dame named Velma. They ask him to leave cause he ain't dressed proper. - You know what he does? - What? He trounced the head waiter across the room. - Then he starts back here. - Yeah. Dames scream. Guys yell. - Manager hears the commotion. - 'He sees the guy at the door.' - He runs back to the desk. - For a Roscoe. He takes aim. - Fires. - Twice. - Like you can see, he missed. - Too bad. "Will the police apprehend the killer? Tune in tomorrow at 6:50. Go on! Give me the rest. Then the killer goes to work, he lams outta here in double time, hops in a car and powders. He must have had an accomplice waiting in that car. That's a great deduction. [phone ringing] Get that. I might even say brilliant. Grimes talking. Okay. Fingerprint Bureau. For you. O'Hara. Yeah. Okay. Put on a general radio alarm for him. Fingerprints check with a character named Moose Malloy. Doing a 20 year stretch for manslaughter. Broke out last week. Still owing the state 15 years. How very ungracious of him. Ex-wrestler. 6'5". 265 pounds without his necktie. Just a cute little fella. Go on out there, boys, and turn that crowd loose. We'll pick this mug up within an hour. [male #2] 'I'll have your badge for this flatfoot! I'll tell O'Hara.' Break it up! Break it up! Well, if it isn't Jonathan G. Locke the mastermind stooge. Oh, you. I should've known you'll be behind this miscarriage of injustice. I'm gonna sue you! Shut up. What is this? This mug drove the getaway car. - Yeah? - He's off his beat. It's him, alright, inspector. The doorman saw him. So, Moose Malloy must have had an accomplice, huh? Will you guys quit clowning? If I was an accomplice will I drive back and walk right into your arms? I was parked out front waiting for The Falcon when this man mountain comes and says something about a dame. I don't know him for nothing. So he goes.. - Oh, he did it, huh? - No, no. This guy's tired so we told him to take a nap. Go ahead. The mountain runs out, jumps in the car. He grabs me by the neck and he says, "Get going." - Did he have a rod? - He didn't flash it. Oh, you obeyed an unharmed stranger, huh? I obeyed what had me by the neck. A gun ain't the only way of killing people. - How did he get it? - Broken neck. Didn't I tell you? Yeah. Now tell me where you took him. Why, I, uh.. ...I-I just drove him around till he said he'd get out. - Where? - Ten blocks over the subway. You just let him off? Just like that. Did he give you a tip? He tipped me to keep my trap shut so he wouldn't have to shut it for keeps. So we're gonna need Goldy here. Nobody else, Mr. Dittenfrisk? That seems to be routine. Think I'd do better in a movie. - Come on, Goldy. - Huh? Go ahead. With your puss, the boys can pick you up anytime. Wise guy. [people chattering] Camera-shy, Goldy? Yeah. Me and my neck wants to be in magneto. Aren't you Gay Lawrence, "The Falcon"? - Guilty. - We're reporters, Mr. Lawrence. - You interested in this case? - It's a coincidence I am here. That's what you told before you broke the Gordon murder ring. This time it's true, boys. O'Hara's on his own. What a break for crime? - Why did you lie to O'Hara? - Well, I didn't, I tell you. Goldy, where did you really take the killer? 17 Washington Avenue. Over in Brooklyn. Near a graveyard. So he wouldn't have to carry the bodies too far. And you even wanted to keep it from me. Why? Moose said he'd mangle me if I squawked. He's strictly the mangling type. This can get you into trouble with O'Hara. Not the kind of trouble I'll get in with The Moose. Anyways, we're in a brokerage business, remember? You swore off dames and crimes. This case seems especially interesting. Ah, I should know better. Where are we going? 17 Washington Avenue, Brooklyn. Okay. Wait a minute! That's where I took.. - Exactly. - But you can't do this! We can if we're quick enough. That guy ain't human. He's a mountain. So, like Mohammed we go to the mountain. - 'Isn't that the house?' - 'That's where I took him.' You stay here and keep the engine running. And be prepared for a quick start. I don't even have to prepare. Better take this with you. [intense music] [music continues] [music continues] [door opens] [door closes] [music continues] Hiya, Herman!

No. I wasn't trying to find you.' - I didn't do nothin', Moose. - Shh. It's me. - Let's get out of here. Quick. - He's gone. - Maybe he forgot his hat. - You wait here. I am going in to investigate. I should've become a fireman like me old lady wanted me to. [music continues] He'd kill me. You gotta protect me. Do something. I've always taken care of you, haven't I? You've been getting your money every week as I promised. But I didn't know Moose was gonna bust out. - He'd kill me if he finds out. - Tell me what The Moose said. He wants to know what happened to Velma. He's coming back for information. He says he'll strangle me if I don't get it. We'll take care of him. When he comes back, tell him he can get the information he wants about her if he goes to.. Yeah. Yeah. [doorbell buzzing] - Mrs. Jessie Florian? - What do you want? I want to ask you some questions. I'm an investigator. Just a moment. Cops, huh? Well, you ain't got nothing on me. So, come on in. - Well, what do you want? - A girl named Velma. Velma? Yes, I, uh, want to try and trace her for her folks. - Here. - You ain't no cop. No cop ever flashes a ten-spot. What's the gag, mister? I only said I was an investigator. Private creep, huh? Where's her folks at? What difference does that make? Ha! Okay, all cops is the same. Okay, handsome, when I like a guy the ceiling's the limit. [click] [trunk closes] Here, you'll find a picture of all the girls that worked at the club. - Pick her out. - What club? Mike's. Do you know my husband, Mike Florian ran a club? - Where the Club 13 is now. - Which one of these is Velma? Didn't her folks give you a picture of her so you'd know her? No, they didn't. Trying' to put something over on me, you dirty snoop. Get out of here before I bust your skull. Sit down. You're not dealing with a simple-minded lug like Moose Malloy. What do you know about him? He killed a man tonight. Then the cops are after him, huh? They'll get him maybe, huh? Maybe. Alright, now, what about Velma? I don't know. - She's dead I think. - When did she die? I don't know. I ain't telling you anything more. Now get out of here. Get out of here, you dirty snoop. Very well, but I'll be back. Get out of here. I'll kill you if you come back. - You better think it over. - Get out! [glass shattering] Now you won't get your deposit back. I ain't curious about anything not pertaining to the case. But what kept you back there? A charming old lady named Jessie Florian. - Was she alive? - Very much. Pull over to the curb, driver. I want to buy a newspaper. Paper. Thank you. [Gay] '"Gay Lawrence, sometimes known as The Falcon, amateur sleuth' "seen leaving the Club 13 with his associate "Jonathan Goldy Locke." That's it. Now all I have to do is find my pallbearers. Or maybe Moose will carry my coffin all by himself. Don't worry, Goldy, Malloy isn't looking for you. Neither was he looking for the manager of club 13. Now, where is he? - Where are we going? - Home. They ain't got our address on, have they? But we're listed in the phonebook. I'm going to take an ocean voyage. Goldy. - Good evening, gentlemen. - Hello. - Good evening, Jerry. - Evening, sir. - Any messages? - Yes. A very pretty lady called here twice to see you. I supposed you asked her to stay? - No. I told her to go away. - What? That your fiance was a female bullfighter from Mexico City. - Named Lupe. - Really? - Now who told you to say that? - Your fiance. - Oh, that's fine. - Thank you, sir. You don't think a pane of glass is going to stop him? But it will give me a running start. [telephone ringing] Well, that must be the young lady. Answer it, Goldy. That's all we need is some cookie to complicate things. Listen, lady.. What? Who? Guy named Marriot. - Who's he? - How should I know? Hello, yeah. Yes, I'm available. Alright, I'll be right over. Goodbye. What gives? Who was that guy? - Lindsey W. Marriot. - Never heard of him. - Nor have I. - What does he want? What are you going to use that gun for? He wants a private detective and all private detectives carry guns. - You ain't no private dick. - I am tonight. - Now, where you going? - I'm going to see Mr. Marriot. Are you crazy? What's this all about? I don't know, but I have a vague feeling that it ties in somehow with Moose Malloy. Just take it easy, Goldy. Sit down and relax. People who have the ability to relax live longer. [engine revving] [cars honking] - Well, there he goes. - I don't get it. Why don't we put the pinch on him now, chief? In my dumb way I've got a kind of a cute eye there. - You don't mind, do you? - No, of course not. Thanks. Ah-h, take it easy, will you? Those claws are so tight, you could play a harp solo on 'em. Yes, a lovely instrument. [doorbell buzzes] Excuse me, sir. Oh. This is the first time in my life I was ever glad to see a cop. Well, it's just a livin'. - Pick a party, you. - A what? - Beat it. - Of course. Can I do something for you, fellas? Yeah. Would you tell us where your car is? The last I saw it, it was parked in front of the building. - You're a nice guy, Goldy. - Getting to like me, huh? You're a nice guy, but you're in trouble. Look, O'Hara, you ain't accusing me of being in cahoots with that murderer again, are you? Certainly not, nothing like that. All we want to know is, how it happens we find Moose Malloy's fingerprints all over a car found abandoned in Canarsie? - How could I know that? - Maybe because it was your car. We've got enough on you to send you up for 100 years. - We might even make it life. - Unless you play ball. State your proposition. Good, now we're getting somewhere. We know your boss is gettin' himself mixed up in this murder. What we want to know is, where he goes and what he does. You're on the wrong floor, the rats is in the basement. Oh, now, Goldy, I know you better than that. Look, this case ain't as simple as it seems. And if it ain't handled right it's liable to land you and me and your boss right in the middle of the East River in a concrete nightgown. So? So, all I want you to do is to accept this little token of my esteem and consider yourself my special confidential deputy. It's still a stool pigeon where I come from. Okay, take a choice. Sing or sing sing. Listen, O'Hara, you can't scare me, see? I know the law, you can't pin nothing on me until you proved corpus delictis. I'll give you 24 hours to make up your mind. You're letting him get away with it like that? - Yeah. You don't mind, do you? - No, of course not, chief. I'm not at liberty to divulge many details about this case. It'll be sufficient for you to know that the job is simple. I'll pay you well and the risk is small. I think you better let me be the judge of that. Very well. I'm meeting some men tonight and paying them some money. I'd like to have someone with me. You carry a gun? Yes, but I seldom shoot anybody. What is it, blackmail? I'm not in the habit of giving people grounds for blackmail. Well, it happens to the nicest people. I'm meeting these men in a lonely place. - I'm not much of a hero. - They know you? I'm not sure, I'm acting for a friend. It's a large amount of money. What for? I told you, I want no liberty to go into that. I think you better get someone else. I don't like your manner. I can't say that I'm particularly intrigued by yours either, goodnight. Just a moment. I'll tell you what you need to know. A lady friend and I were held up on our way home from a night club. My loss was negligible, but my friend's jewels were taken. Have you ever heard of the Fei Tsui jade? Vaguely, yes. Practically priceless. They stole her necklaces worth, perhaps $90,000. But it'll be hard to dispose off. So the thieves are selling it back to her through me. I've been warned not to call in police or the deal's off. I contacted you because I don't want the risk of a double cross. How'd you know about me? Your exploits would be rather well publicized. - Thank you. - You're ready? Yeah. Rather a deserted bit of country, isn't it? We're almost there. You seem to know your way pretty well. Their instructions were very explicit. [frogs croaking] [intense music] Restful spot. They're waiting for this over in that churchyard. [music continues] - Coming? - You'd better go alone I think. I think so too. Just a moment. Leave your gun here. They said to be unarmed. [music continues] [music continues] [gunshot] [car door creaking] [frogs croaking] [gunshot] [footsteps] [engine revving at a distance] [croaking continues] [shrieks] [intense music] I'm holding a ten shot automatic and I can shoot. Eight shot. Stay where you are. Reach for the sky or I'll let you have it. You better use both hands. You alright? Nobody ever got killed by a blank cartridge. - You mean it's full of blanks? - I should know. I loaded it. You are a good shot and lovely too. I didn't shoot him. I never shot anybody in my life. I don't even have a gun. You could have thrown the gun away, but you didn't. - Oh, no, Mr. Lawrence. - Who are you? I-I guess I better tell you. Yes, I think you better. Well, you see, I'm a newspaper reporter. What paper? Well, none at the moment, but if I could just crack this Malloy case, I could get a job on any paper in town. You see I come from, well, Morgan, Minnesota but I got a degree in journalism. - What are you doing here? - Following you. How do you know me? I've heard about you and your picture was in tonight's paper, I tried to see you at your apartment, but your boy just wouldn't let... - So, you're the pretty girl? - What? Oh, that's alright. Just go on with your story. Well, I decided the best way to crack this case was to follow the smartest man involved in it. So I did. You believe me, don't you? I like you, which is much more important. [dramatic music] What did you put in your pocket? - Just a business card. - Look, I'm in this too. I'll take care of you. Have you got a car? - Sort of. - Let's go downtown and confess. - Confess? - Yeah. So you just happened to be driving by and heard the shots? That's right. Which gives you a pretty nice witness. - Never had it nicer. - Oh, thank you, Mr. Lawrence. I ain't in the way, am I? Since when did you turn bodyguard for a playboy? - I just had a hunch. - Mind if I have one too? - Help yourself. - Alright. My hunch is there's something fishy about the whole story. Jade necklaces, bodyguards, pretty dames, who just happen to be driving by cemeteries, when a murder takes place. Michael. I've got another hunch if you wanna know. You two find better ways of staying out of trouble and poking your noses in police affairs. Now get out and stay out of my hair. [all together] Which hair? Okay, I know. I know. - Well, that's that. - This isn't brush off, is it? Not socially I hope, just professionally. Don't tell me you're gonna quit the case just because - that snide old cop... - Why should I go on? Well, I thought we might.. Well, anyway you have helped. - I've got something to go on. - What? The Jade necklace, I'm going to every jeweler until I trace it. Forget about it. I can get you a job. I get my own jobs, goodbye. I'll tell you what, I'll make a bargain with you. If you get any dope on that necklace I'll follow through on the case. - You will? - It's a promise. Don't wait until you've tracked it down before you call me. Oh, I won't. You know it's wonderful of you to do this for me. [engine misfiring] It's just practicing to be a tank. I might have known you'd run into a dame. Dames and trouble, they go together with you. - Well, I'm lucky. - Lucky? Suppose she tracks down that necklace. Then what happens? Oh, she won't. There isn't any necklace. Just relax, and tell Jerry to get me a cup of coffee. I'm relaxed. As long as you don't break your promise to keep us away from Moose Malloy. Mr. Lawrence will be very angry when he hears about this. I warn you madam, female bullfighters are a particularly dangerous species of femininity. Will you please tell Mr. Lawrence I'm here. I'll take care of this, Jerry. Take a powder. - You mean, beat it? - Yeah. - What can I do for you? - Is Mr. Lawrence in? No, he just left on a round-the-world trip. He'll be back tomorrow. I mean, next August. - I'm Ann Riordan. - Oh, okay. - Sit down. - Thank you. Look, sister, I don't know what your racket is. But his racket is the bond business and mine is to keep him in it. Now, confidentially, the boss is a pushover for a pretty face. He'll string you along and drop you like an old shoe. Why don't you get.. - Good morning, Ann. - Hello. - Thanks for the buildup, Goldy. - I've some good news for you. That's fine. Tell me all about it. I found out the jade necklace belongs to Diana Kenyon. Wha...you mean to say there really is a jade necklace? Why, of course there's a jade necklace. You.. Oh, I see. You thought I was on a wild goose chase. Guess who's the goose? You can't back out now. You promised. - Oh, alright. I'm in it. - Which is no surprise to me. What about this Diana Kenyon? She's a big shot in cafe society. - She's a famous beauty and... - A beauty, you say. [Goldy] 'He's wondering why he don't know her.' - It's worth $90,000, what's... - Let's take this slower. She's been running around with this Marriot. I gathered she sort of plays the field, if you get what I mean. - Oh, that's interesting. - It would be to you. - I wonder how we can meet her. - I've arranged that. I'm to interview her about her necklace for an article, she thinks. In half an hour, in fact. Well, that's quick work. Let's go. Oh, Goldy, what are you doing this afternoon? Nothing. And I don't like the way you're asking me. Here, this may give you some laughs. It don't read funny to me. I want you to call on Mr. Amthor at 4 o'clock sharp. - What for? - Get your fortune told. - Let me know how you come out. - What? [doorbell buzzes] - I'm Ann Riordan. - Will you come in, please? Thank you. I'll tell Miss Kenyon you're here. - Oh. - Good morning, Miss Kenyon. I really wasn't expecting, uh.. Well, I hope you don't mind my having brought a friend. Not at all. As a matter of fact, I've always had a secret ambition to meet Mr. Gay Lawrence. Oh, then you know The Falcon? Only from hearsay, but it was a very intriguing gossip. Have you become a reporter? I must confess I used this innocent little girl to get an interview with you. Oh, are you interested in the necklace too? I'm much more interested in its owner. It's strange that we haven't met before. It's stranger still if we don't meet again. Can probably be arranged. Ahem! I don't want to change the subject, but I was going... - Yes, yes, of course. - Oh, you're not leaving? Oh, I really must. You see, I almost forgot my cue. It was lovely meeting you. Charming girl. She was alone in the city and I befriended her. I suppose you know about Mr. Marriot. - Yes, what really happened? - He just drew a blank. - Poor fellow. - Know much about him? I think he had some pretty shady connections. Didn't that bother you? I'm not in the habit of checking on people's past. Particularly when they rumba well. It seems evident that he was double-crossed. You think he might've had connection with the holdup gang? Possibly. 'Could you give me a description of the men?' No, it all happened too fast. Why are you so interested in Marriot? I'm not really, but I have a suspicion that he was connected in some way with a gentleman named Moose Malloy. 'I'm anxious to find out what that connection was.' Moose Malloy? That sounds grotesque. Do we have to talk about it anymore? No. And it's beginning to bore me too. You aren't really a detective, are you? No, I just took this job and I think I'll finish it. If it's the jade necklace, you are really working for me. Only if you want me. I think I do. Oh, may I offer you a drink? - Never before a sundown. - And after that? After that the deluge. What about tonight? Fine. Shall we make it The Swan Club at 10? That's an excellent idea. Well.. Sorry I kept you waiting, dear. I like the way I was eased out of there. You should've stayed to protect me. I didn't hear you yell for help. You're jumping at conclusion. If you plan to argue the point you'd better remove the lipstick. Oh. Well, that's a purely circumstantial evidence. Doesn't prove a thing. Well, if your life depended on it, you'd be a dead duck. Well, what did you find out? I mean, about the case. About the case? Well, practically nothing...yet. - By the way, are you jealous? - You're positively psychic. Psychic? That reminds me. I wonder what's happening to Goldy? - Go ahead, follow him. - Why, chief? Because I've got a gold badge and you've got a silver badge and I wanna follow him. - You don't mind, do you? - No, of course not, chief. [eerie music] [sniffs] You have an appointment with the great Amthor? - You mean the swami? - He's not a swami, my friend. - The great Amthor is... - Yeah, I know. The great Amthor is great. - You were to be here at 4? - Yeah, how did you know? The great Amthor knows all. He's expecting you. You will come with me. [music continues] - Go ahead, I'll follow you. - You are to go in alone. Hey, mahatma! [intense music] [male #4] 'Come in, please.' Sit down, please. Why are you here in place of your friend? What friend? My appointment was with Mr. Moose Malloy personally. I cannot deliver the message he seeks to anyone else. Wait here. Idiot! You let in the wrong man. Show him out quickly. I'd better get out of here. Excuse me. Moose! - It's you again, huh? - I didn't do nothing, Moose. I wasn't trying to follow you, honest. I was only gonna get me fortune told. [Moose] 'Hmm, sure, sure.' [indistinct chatter] [clanking] [gunshots] [footsteps] [gunshots] Open up! Open in the name of the law. Open up that door! [gunshots] - Quiet in the name of the law! - Stay where you are! So we ain't got nothing on you, huh? Yeah, we gotta prove corpus delictis. I'm sitting in a chair! I'm gonna get me fortune told when all of a sudden The Moose walks... - Take him down to headquarters. - With pleasure. Hey, wait a minute! You can't pin this on me! Alright, Goldy, for the last time why'd you knock off them swamis? I'm sitting in a chair, I'm gonna get me fortune told when all of a sudden The Moose comes... How'd you know he was gonna be there? - I didn't... - You arranged the meeting? You think I'd be near that joint if I knew Moose was gonna be there? - Then, why'd you go? - The Falcon gave me a card. He says, "Get your fortune told." He must've had some clue that Moose was coming. - What was it? - Why don't you ask The Falcon? We're asking you. I'm sittin' in a chair, I'm gonna... Gonna have me fortune told. Yeah, I know. Alright, then. Take him down to the DA, boys. Book him as being an accessory before the fact, after the fact aiding and abetting homicide and compounding a felony. Go on, get him out of here. Hey, wait a minute, you gorillas! This is... Just a minute, boys. Maybe we've been misjudging Goldy. I think he wants to cooperate with us. - Don't you, Goldy? - Sure, Mike. Meet my new special confidential deputy. Welcome to the force, chum. Hey, take it easy, will you? My neck ain't never gonna be the same. It appears that your vertebrae is at least an inch longer today, sir. Yeah, it's stretched to the limit. One more twist from The Moose and it'll bust. It might be wiser to return to the hoosegow, sir. So you've been spying again, huh? How much do you know? I saw the badge in your pocket. Need more be said, sir? One crack to the boss, I'll show you how The Moose does it. Not interested, sir. It is sometimes wiser to be, shall we say, uninformed. - Yeah, you were only kidding. - Hello, Goldy. Back already? Yeah, do you know anymore good swamis? Not offhand. What happened? I ran into The Moose and grew another inch. You mean Malloy was there? He just dropped in to strangle a swami and his assistant. Then he had to leave. He had a date with a giraffe. How'd he miss you? He was working on me when O'Hara showed. O'Hara? How did he get wise? I don't know, but I was mad at him for butting in. Put your coat on. We're going for a ride. Sounds like more trouble. No thanks. I'll sit this out. Alright, as you like. I thought you'd be safer with us. Malloy might find out where you live. Why, thanks. - May I go along? - Yes. We'll drop you off at police headquarters. I want you to get a look at the records of the Malloy case. Make notes of anything important. Come on, Goldy. Something tells me this ain't gonna be no joyride. Pump information out of Bates, but don't let O'Hara know. - Right. - Meet me later tonight. - After you leave Miss Kenyon? - This is strictly business. Liar! A lovely woman is even lovelier when she's angry. And an ugly man gets uglier. Where to? - That dame's apartment? - No, to Jessie Florian's. So long, boss. This is the end of a beautiful friendship. - We haven't any time to lose. - You said it. I got 30 years to go. I don't wanna lose them at once. - Come on, don't argue. - I've gotta get cigarettes. Inspector O'Hara's office. Bates speaking. Hey, Bates, this is Goldy Locke, but don't mention my name. The boss just sent a dame up there to get some dope on Moose Malloy. Yeah? That's very interesting. Look, Bates, me and The Falcon are going down to old lady Florian's. 17 Washington Avenue in Brooklyn. Look, Bates, you gotta get O'Hara there in a hurry. If I run into The Moose again, he'll turn me inside out like a two-bit umbrella in a cyclone. Yeah, I'll phone him and give him the dope. Right. Some dirt on Malloy? What's your slant on the case, lady? I want a feature story for my paper. Well, here's The Moose's record. He was doing a stretch on manslaughter when he escaped. I and my colleague, O'Hara, figured that The Moose took the rap for a big-timer named Burnett. - Who's Burnett? - The nightclub owner. Been around long, but nobody's been able to pin nothing on him. Ever bring him in for questioning? Sure. Only he had all the right answers. Thank you very much, Mr. Bates. I'm sure I'll get a story out of that. That's alright, lady. Always glad to help a good-looking babe. - Aren't you cute? - Cuter then you think, sister. Wanna see my baby pictures? Not at night. I scare too easy. Grimes! I heard you. I'll look at your baby pictures. That dame that just left, get on trail, don't lose it. Hello, chief, I've got a new angle on The Falcon. You wait here and if The Moose comes, just whistle. Hey, boss. I wouldn't be able to whistle the way I feel. Then come along. [intense music] Looks like she's retired for the night. Good, let's go. No, tomorrow might be too late. - Not for me. - Come on! [music continues] Careless old girl, leaving her door open. Maybe she's expectin' somebody. Or someone she wasn't expecting has been here and gone. I don't care if he's been here. - I just hope he's gone. - Shh. [music continues] [thud] Be careful, Goldy. Shh. I kicked a bundle or somethin'. Well, move it out of the way! Okay. Give me some light. Plenty heavy. Wonder what she's got wrapped up in here. Take a look. [gasps] Easy, Goldy. Like I told you, there goes two of them thirty years. Broken neck, just like Montgomery's. Why should he wanna knock off an old dame like that? She wouldn't give him some information that she had. Why wouldn't she spill it? She was obviously protecting somebody. Who? When we find that out, Goldy, we'll crack this case wide open. Also, maybe our necks. Whoever she was covering for instructed her to send Malloy to Amthor's. They didn't think he'd leave Amthor's alive, but he did. And how! I still can't seem to fit Marriot into this case though. Would you mind trying to fit him in at home? Look, you stay where you are. I'm just gonna move around a bit. And leave me alone? You're perfectly safe. Malloy won't come back. Just sit tight. [intense music] [whistles] [music continues] [door shuts] [footsteps approaching] [doorknob turning] [door creaking open] [no audio] [footsteps] [gasps] Hey, Goldy, is that you? 'It's me, O'Hara. We got your message.' What goes on here? What, again? Hey, look, can't I have just one murder without finding you layin' around with a body? Can't I? Can't I? No, Moose! I didn't do nothing, Moose! I wasn't following you, Moose! Snap out of it, will ya? It's me, O'Hara! You got a nerve! Sneakin' up on a guy like this! How'd I know what I was gonna find here? - Where's The Falcon? - Ain't he around? He ain't never around when I get on the scene. [car engine starts] - Where's he goin'? - I don't know. Start talkin' fast or I'll tell you where you're going. Go ahead! Put the cuffs on me! A stretch and a clink will be like living at the Ritz after what I've been through! I accept your resignation. Come on! Come on, Jerry. I'll need you. - Hello. - Hello. What's the hurry? I've got a lot to do. I'll explain later. Here's something to look at while you're waiting. [Jerry] Goodness. [man on TV] 'Special bulletin.' 'The police of five boroughs have been warned to be' 'on the look out for Gay Lawrencealias The Falcon' 'who is wanted by the homicide bureau' 'for questioning in connection with the mysterious murder' 'of Mrs. Jessie Florian.' How long do you think it'll take O'Hara to track you down here? [Gay] 'He probably thinks I'm much too smart to come home.' So this is Velma. - 'Gorgeous, isn't she?' - In a vulgar sort of way. 'What's vulgar about a beautiful figure?' Did you study the face? Oh, I haven't gotten around to that, yet. Hmm! [whistles] [Guy] 'What did you find out at police headquarters?' Nothing much, except they think Malloy took the rap for a gentleman he used to work for named Laird Burnett. - Burnett? Are you sure? - Of course. - He runs The Swan Club. - Give me that. I've an idea. [banging on door] [male #5] 'Open up. Police.' Wow! [waltz music] Hello. A real champion keeps the challenger waiting. I'm sorry, darling, I couldn't get away. Did you try very hard? - Oh, does it show? - A little. Well, that makes matters even. She'll be glad to hear that. - Now, let's talk about you. - Why, Mr. Lawrence. I should warn you that I'm being sought by the police. - How exciting! - You can help me clear myself. I'd love to. Now, that I've found you, I'd hate to lose you. Naturally. Do you know a Burnett, the owner of this club? - I'm his star customer. - I'd like to meet him. - Could you introduce me? - Surely, but why? I think he can tell me something about Moose Malloy. Burnett? I don't understand how he'd... Just don't try to solve it, darling. Leave it to me. - Now, let's go and meet him. - Alright. [music continues] - Check your hat, sir? - Uh...no thanks, sister. [Burnett] 'Come in.' - Hello, Laird. - Hello, Miss Kenyon. Glad you dropped by. How's everything? No complaints. I just wanted you to meet a friend of mine. Mr. Lawrence, Mr. Burnett. - How do you do? - Oh, The Falcon! Any friend of Miss Kenyon's is always welcome. Thanks very much. Delightful place. It has to be. I entertain delightful people. I must admit I had a purpose in meeting you, Mr. Burnett. Yes? I was wondering if you had any means of getting in touch with Moose Malloy. Malloy? Why should I? Uh, he worked for you once, didn't he? Lots of people have worked for me but I'm not responsible for their actions. You misunderstand me. I didn't mean to infer that you were involved with Malloy. I just thought that he might seek your protection. If he were foolish enough to do that. Naturally, I would have to inform the police. Naturally. Malloy seems to be very anxious to find this young lady. If he thought that we knew anything about her we could probably trap him. [Burnett] Just what is your interest in this case, Mr. Lawrence? [Gay] 'I'm tracking down a valuable necklace for Miss Kenyon.' [Diana] 'That's right, Laird.' [Burnett] Sorry, but I'm afraid I can't help you. [Diana] 'Let me see that.' You know, I've seen this girl somewhere before. You have? - I'm sure. The Green Mill. - The what? It's a little roadhouse on the Old Post Road. She's dancing in the floorshow there. - Are you positive? - Quite. I remember wondering why such a beautiful girl could waste herself in an isolated spot like that. - Probably hiding out. - Of course. Let's take a drive there. My car is out front. That's an excellent idea. Come on. - Oh, goodbye, Mr. Burnett. - Goodbye, Mr. Lawrence. So long, Laird. Don't let The Moose get you. Be careful, yourself. [door closes] [crowd applauding] - It's one of O'Hara's men. - What'll we do? - Get somebody to start a fight. - What? Go on, don't argue. Get somebody to start a fight. - Sock somebody, Louie. - What? - Start a fight. - You want to get me fired? It won't get you fired, it'll get you a raise. [soft piano music] Okay, Miss Kenyon. Go on, hurry up. Hey, you! What's the big idea molesting this lady? - What? - I beg your pardon? This lady happens to be my wife. Oh, yeah? That's what they all say. Why, you.. [women screaming] [all clamoring] [women screaming] [screams] Come on. You get the car. I'll be right with you. - Get this quick. - Oh, yes, sir. One minute. Give me paper and a pencil. Yes, sir. There's a Mr. Grimes of police headquarters on the floor. Give him this note when he disentangles. Yes, sir. - Did you get rid of him? - Yes. Let's get going quickly. Drive out to the Old Post Road, Gerger. Mr. Grimes, Mr. Grimes. There's a message for you. You better read it to me. "You can catch up with me if you take the Old Post Road. - Signed, The Falcon." - The Falcon? [screams] Police! Police! - Lonely highway, isn't it? - It isn't used much anymore. It's a nice place to go for a ride. That's what I thought. - Oh, so it is a ride. - You've guessed it. You've guessed too many things, Mr. Falcon. Check me if I've guessed wrong. You're Velma. You were in the swami racket with Burnett, Marriot, Amthor. Was a good living until you looked into the crystal ball. Burnett was the headman. It was his job to recommend wealthy Swan Club patrons to Amthor. You'd be surprised how those society saps fell for that swami drivel. They bare their souls. And then you promptly blackmailed them. You're amazing. And so amusing. Tsk tsk tsk. It's a shame you're too dangerous to have around. [Gay] 'You planned my murder once before, didn't you?' [Diana] 'That was Laird Burnett's idea.' Getting rid of you and Marriot at one time. - Why Marriot? - He was getting weak. We knew it'd be only a matter of time until he would talk under pressure. You and Burnett are rather close, aren't you? [Diana] 'Rather.' [Guy] 'Jesse Florian knew about your past' and present romance, didn't she? She was also being paid to forget some information she knew about a manslaughter that Malloy took for Burnett. We were a little worried when you tracked The Moose to her. I don't see any cars, chief. Could it creep under that thick skull of yours that maybe deliberately gave you a bum steer? No, sir. Did it creep in yours? No...shut up! You know, if we could find a road with some traffic on it maybe we could pinch somebody for speeding. How did you know the picture was a fake? Because the handwriting on it matched a little note that Jessie left around. Unfinished. You know, I can't understand how such brilliance could get you into a spot like this. I'm always a sucker for a beautiful woman. You and mankind. Nobody will disturb us. We left the old road quite sometime ago. Alright, Gerger. Take The Falcon for a walk. 'And come back alone.' Hello, baby. Gerger couldn't come. Moose. Yeah. So it's you and Burnett, huh? That's my payoff for taking his rap. Moose, listen. I wanted to come back, but he wouldn't let me. [Diana] 'Honest, Moose.' I saw Burnett last night, baby. He said he didn't know where you was. He lied. He didn't want you to find me. He said he'd kill me if I went back to you. Now, Velma. Why did you do it, baby? [intense music] [gunshot] Why did you do it? Why did you do.. That leaves only you to take care of now. [car approaching] Don't tell me you had to struggle with her now. And in such a romantic spot too. Tsk tsk tsk. This time they weren't blanks. Holy cats! It's lucky for me that you're a jealous woman. I followed you only because of my interest in the journalistic aspects of this case, Mr. Lawrence. Hmm. Well, there's your story. 'You can pick any newspaper in town for your job.' I think Inspector O'Hara would like to see you. Jeepers! Goodbye, Miss Kenyon. A good lawyer and your charms should get you off in 30 years. Yeah. I've decided to give you and your stooge a break. I'm gonna drop the charges against you. - Well, thank you. - It's alright. Come on, Bates. Let's pick up Burnett. - Why, chief? Who said so? - Uh.. I'm the head of the Homicide Squad. I'd like to pinch him, if you don't mind. - No, not at all, chief. - Thanks. Okay, Goldy, spill it. I'm sittin' in a chair, I'm gonna have me fortune told when all of a sudden The Moose comes. - What's the idea? - Alright, free him, Elmer. Oh, no, you don't. I'm staying right here till the season for Moose is on. Miss Kenyon opened it officially a few hours ago and without a license. You got a call from the airport, Mr. Lawrence. Your fiance just arrived. She's waiting there for you. Oh, thanks. Oh, Gay! Darling! Look. Well, that's fine! Now, you don't need me anymore. Oh, but I thought my...but.. My dear, there are moments when one must face reality with courage and steadfast bearing. My fiance is waiting. I have pledged my life to her alone. You understand, my dear? - Take your hands off me, you! - Come on! Well, just because that ham actor, Barry Featherbush. gets himself bumped off in the dressing room isn't any reason a bunch of hardworking girls 'have to be deprived of their livelihood!' Well, tell that to the chief. Mr. Falcon. I recognize you from your picture in the newspapers. - Help us, we'll be grateful. - Come on, sister. [female #1] 'Are you going to allow us girls to suffer this injustice?.' - Come on! - Are you? I should say not. Back to his old game. Yeah, only this time, he hit the jackpot.
