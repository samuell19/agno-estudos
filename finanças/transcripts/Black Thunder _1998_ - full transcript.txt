All systems a go, waiting for your order, Sir. Thank you, Colonel. I got F-16's at 10 and two o’clock. -Roger, that is a bogey. Let's get him. -I'm right on your Wing, Boss. -There he goes. -I’m on him. You hang back, I’ll take him. Bogey in sight. Closing to mark 0.7. I’m coming up on his 6. Mel to Edwards, standby to go active on my mark. Getting a ﬁx, target locking on. Got you. -Ratchets got a lock, sir. -Told you, he’s the best. Nova, engage active stealth on my mark. 3, 2, 1, mark. Blue 2, I've lost contact with our bandit. Do you have a positive? It’s gone. Cheek your FLARE. No sign of him on the HOZ, the FLARE or the E-O, sir. Target locator line is blank, range to target negative. Closure rate zero. Nothing. -What about visual contact? -Now you see him, now you don’t. He’s not on any of our displays and I don’t see him out there. A plane can’t just disappear. Where the hell did he come From? Incredible. Trying evasive maneuvers. Weapons engaged. I can’t shake him, shit! Lock on. Fire side missile. Blue 1, you’ve been tagged. Abort your mission and return to base. Shit. Let's rock and roll. Going full throttle. I can’t see him, I can’t see him. Ratcher’s been tagged. Ratcher’s been tagged. Sorry, Tom. You are the best we’ve got but nobody can beat Nova technology. Go ahead and continue on to rendezvous point Delta. That’s a 95 percent PK, Splash two F-16‘s. Nice job, Nova. That’s an impressive piece of hardware you’ve got there. Thank you, sir. Black Thunder returning to base. Roger, Nova. Great job. -Congratulation, Colonel. -Thank you, sir. Event Tom couldn’t get past the Nova. We gave him a hell of a surprise. Yes, sir, I’m sure we did. General Barnes... Great Job... -Thanks. -Great job. It's a milk run, sir. I could have blasted those F-16‘s out of the sky if you’d given me any word. I know you could have, I know. Well tomorrow’s our last test exercise. After that we go from prototype to production. You sending me to Baghdad, sir? From your lips to God’s ears. Now, unfortunately I'm only putting Nellis on full alert. Everyone from General Sorenson to the janitor will be looking for you. You get in there, I’ll buy you dinner. Sir, I can taste that lobster now. I bet you can. Edwards, we’ve got a problem. Sir, Ratcher’s reporting a malfunction. -Talk him through it, Captain. -Blue 1, what’s your status, over? Blue 1 to Edwards, do you copy? Flame out! We’ve lost both rear engines. Going down. Base..base! -Sir, he’s got a flame out. -Tom, get the hell out of there. He's losing altitude fast, Blue 1, eject. Eject, eject. Can’t eject. The G-force is too strong. -We’ve lost all radar contact. -Did he have time to eject? -It doesn’t look good. -Dammit. OK, I’ll inform General Barnes. -Sir. -Yes, Colonel. -Colonel Ratcher’s plane went down. -What? -He crashed a few miles out. -What the hell happened? Apparently a ﬂame out. Search and rescue’s starting their investigation now. -Did he get out? -No, sir. How the hell did this happen? Torn Ratcher’s one of the best pilot’s we’ve ever had. -What do we have here? -A surprise. Very-nice. Awesome. No. -Who is it? -Base camp. They’re probably passed I didn’t ﬁll out my reports. Yes, sir. Yeah, right away. Hey, babe. Uh, You’re not going to believe this but I’ve got to go. You’re kidding. Man, I wish I was. Can we do this tomorrow? -Do I have a choice? -Thanks. Okay. Hey, Nick. How are you? Nick. -Morning. -Morning. You up for this today? Yeah. Sure, as ready as I’ll ever he. Good. Investigation team will want to talk to you about Torn when you get back. Sure, yeah, set it up. Gentlemen. Today the Nova goes up against the best air craft detection system in the world. A United States Air Force Base. Sir, you really think the Nova can get through Nellis’ radar and patrol ﬁghter net? They’re locked down tight as a drum. Not only will the Nova get through, but Colonel Moore will drop a dummy payload... right in the middle of runway one. When he succeeds it will he the beginning of a new era in stealth technology. Captain. Nova 1, you are now cleared for take-off. Sir, last radar contact with the Nova was here, that was 15 minutes ago. He should have reached Nellis two minutes after that. Now if he’s still cloaked he’s in experimental territory. We’ve never been active that long before. And Nellis has no conﬁrmation of payload drop? Alright, Captain, let’s break radio silence. Yes, Sir. Nova, Edwards, do you copy? Break radio silence and answer, Nova. Nova, do you copy? There is nothing, sir. Alright, Colonel, have Nellis start a search and rescue operation immediately. -There is one other possibility, sir. -Yes? Colonel Moore went AWOL with the plane. I hand picked the Colonel for this project. I ﬂew with his father in Vietnam, goddamn it. This man would not steal my airplane. Stone, this is Black Thunder. Black Thunder to Stone, do you copy? -Ha, ha, ha. Go Black Thunder. -The Nova is secure. Excellent, excellent. -Proceed to phase 2. -Copy that. Sir, Colonel Moore went through security check point this morning, Three sets of blue caps saw his ID card, his thumb prints on the records. And no one else had access to the notebooks, including our other pilots? -Right. -While there’s no way to get a radar ﬁx. And Nellis has no reports of wreckage in the area. Dammit. Come with me, Colonel. There’s something kind of funny about us losing a stealth plane. I’m not laughing, Colonel: What I mean, sir, is we build an invisible War Plane and... I knew what you mean. Have CIO start a satellite re-con immediately. And I want an SR71 fueled and ready to go. -Yes, Sir. -And Colonel, get Vince Connors. OK, ready? What are the four forces of ﬂying? Uh, the four forces... Thrust, Drag, Lift and Weight. You are very good, Winston. So, you gonna let me ﬂy the plane now? Like I said, you’ve got to learn this stuff. The basics, like this guy here. See this guy? Tom Ratcher, taught me everything I know. He's the best pilot there is. -And you know what? -He was your teacher. You got it. You’re smart, you know what? You know everything. Whiskey tango delta 71, do you copy? This is Whiskey Tango Delta, copy. Connors, you are to return to the airﬁeld immediately... by order of General Barnes, USAF. This is a national emergency. Copy, heading back. I guess we’re going to have to cut this day short. This is Edwards Air Force Base, to Nova 1. You’ve been detected by Eye In the Sky satellites. By the power and authority of the President of the United States of America, you are hereby ordered to land immediately. -Sorry, sir, we lost him again. -Damn. -Sir, how are you? -Vince, I'm not well. What’s the problem? Vince, what I’m about to tell you does not leave this building, understood? Yes, sir. Earlier today one of our experimental aircraft, the Nova, was stolen from this base. -Stolen? -Stolen. The Nova’s a black project, ultra top secret. Code name Black Thunder. It incorporates standard stealth technology... but it adds something new, an active stealth system. Active? What do you mean active? You’re familiar with the black box ECM on the SR71? Yes, the radar jammer. Yes. We’ve had a team working on improvements for the past thirty ﬁve years. What they’ve come up with is active stealth. It's a cloaking device. A cloaking device? Like in Space Tech. Exactly. It uses an electromagnetic impulse. Which bend light to a wavelength of under 3500 angstrom units Which renders the Nova invisible to the human eye. Blanketed from radar, positioning devices. Things of that nature. Vince. This is a completely invisible airplane. Someone stole this, sir? Yes. One of our best pilots. Took off about three hours ago on a routine training mission. He hasn't returned. Search and Rescue found no indication, no evidence of a crash site. Sir, what kind of range does this plane have? I mean, can’t we just send in a strike force when it stops to refuel? It’s equipped with the latest fuel cell turbine technology. It can ﬂy over twenty thousand kilometers without refueling. -That’s halfway around the world, sir. -Vince. It’s the ultimate weapon, Vince. Whoever has the Nova can literally rule the world. Sir, if each of our bases uses their AWAC’s planes to search... Only a handful of people know this plane even exists. I want to keep it that way. You’re the best pilot I’ve ever seen. Vince, I need you to get that plane back for me. How am I supposed to do that? Active stealth is a drain on the Nova’s power system. It's designed to only work with strategic and evasive operations. So for most of the time it'll be under the cover of standard stealth only. Now, our CIO spy satellite spotted the Nova here, over the Bonan Islands, flying on a heading of two six zero. The Nova is equipped with a DAX satellite monitoring system, so naturally it went active stealth here. Probably moving in a straight line to conserve fuel. Sir, this route’s going to take him through China, India, Iran, Iraq... I don’t know, that’s a lot of ground. That's why I'm sending you up in a modiﬁed SR7l. It’s equipped with the Phillips Thermal Tracking System. Which can pick up the Nova’s heat signature, but only at close range. Sir, they found Colonel Moore’s body in his apartment. Shot twice. Nick Moore? Yes. They cut off his thumb to get by the print scanner. Well at least we know Nick didn’t steal the plane? Well then who the hell did I put in that cockpit this morning? Does the man have an identical twin brother? Vince, I need you to get me that plane back. Minimum footprint. Yes, Sir. You'll be working with Captain Rick Jannick. Geez. -I’m not working with him. -What? He’s not a pilot. Sir. He’s a skydiver, he takes too many chances. With all due respect, sir, I’d rather work with Tom Ratcher. He’s the best ACM pilot in the world. -He’s thought me more stuff than... -Vince... Tom is dead. His plane went down in that training exercise yesterday. This-E Black Thunder to Stone. Preceding to rendezvous-point Alpha. This ought to be interesting. Vince, buddy, it's been along time. That was pleasant. Remember the Blackbird interceptor project back in ‘65? Before my time, sir, but I know of it. -New plane, Same weapons. -Weapons? Great. Let’s just hope we don't have Tu use them, huh? I don’t know about you. But I'm ready to rock and roll. These scumbags took our plane. Let's waste them. We'll get the Nova back without any international incident, sir. Good. I don't want to sound overly dramatic but I don't need to tell you how important this is. No, Sir. -Good luck. -Thank you, Sir. Thank you. Okay, Connors, Jannick. She’s prepped and ready to go. It’s just like old times, Vince. Oxygen pressure, good. Oil pressure, good. And the fuel is ﬂowing. We are set to go. Okay, Tower, in position. Ready for take off. Roger. All systems go. General Barnes. Connors and Jannick are airborne in the SR71, sir. -Radio frequency is open. -Alright. Captain. Let’s ﬁnd this thing and blast it. I got dinner plans tonight if you know what I mean. Orders are to get it back in one piece. Minimum footprint. Jannick, let me be honest with you. You the last person I would have picked to back me up. You're not a pilot, you're a skydiver. You bail at the ﬁrst sign of trouble. Ancient history, My man. I got a lot of air under my wings since then. Yeah? Well just remember my life’s in your hands. And mine in yours, partner. New toy here, my man. Turn right going two ﬁve nine. Turning right going two ﬁve nine. Bingo CIO imaging the Nova. Where? Stand by. Triangulating Nova's position. Over the Thar Desert, in India. It will take five minutes for the fuel cells to recharge. Right, Colonel. Until then he can't go active. -Blackbird, Edwards. -This is Blackbird, go ahead. Vince, we’ve get a ﬁx on the Nova. 27 degrees, 31 minutes north, by 69 degrees 27 minutes east... on a heading of two four-ﬁve. Over. Roger that. We’re on our way. Here we go, may have something. Going Infrared. -Take her down for a visual. -Descending to 45. We have a positive IR signature on the Nova Stealth Fighter. Moving in for visual contact. This is US SR71 Blackbird, please land your aircraft immediately. Got a lock. Nova, please respond. Please respond. If you do not respond, we'll be forced to fire. Jannick, common. Help me out here. Where's the visual? It's hard to make a visual at Mag 2. Where is he? -He’s right behind us. -Hold on. -He’s gone. -Dammit. Where is he? -Base, Connors. -This is Edwards, go ahead. We lost him. He went active stealth. Roger, Vince. What's your status? Sir, if you want us to continue the search, we need to refuel. Vince, there is 135 in your quadrant. -Okay, I copy that. -Okay, I have it. Turning left to point zero eight. This is 135, we have a visual contact with Blackbird. Moving in to begin refueling process. 135, you are locked in Blackbird. Fueling Commencing. -Fueling complete. -Copy. Disengaging. Hey, aren’t you guys going to do the windows? Approaching landing coordinates. Approach vector locked in. Magniﬁcent. Look at my beautiful new Nova plane. Nice work, Ratcher. Not yet. Where’s my money? A man with priorities. I like that. Half now. The rest when we ﬁnish our little bombing mission. Next time you wear the mask. Look at my beautiful plane. Anything? Negative. Got something. Take us to 70 degrees and drop us to 30. 70 degrees, drop to 30. Conﬁrmed sighting of the Nova. Appears to be in Libya, inside some kind of structure. Coordinates, four seven eight by three seven zero. Repeat. Coordinates four seven eight by three seven zero. Positive heat signature. Edwards, Connors. Go ahead, Vince. Jannick located the Nova. Copy that, Vince. There’s a deserted airstrip 7 clicks from those coordinates, sir. The SR71 can land there. Thank you, Colonel. Vince, proceed to eight seven three zero point two. You can land there. And avoid enemy detection. Okay, proceeding to rendezvous. Admiral Pendleton please, General Barnes. Admiral Pendleton. Admiral, we found the Nova on the ground in Libya. Copy that. I’m sending in a pair of men for recovery. We need air support and intelligence on who we’re dealing with. Copy that, Pendleton out. Starting landing site. -Connors, Edwards. -Copy. We’re working on a tight decision cycle. You’ve got twenty four hours to get the plane back. What happens then? An aircraft carrier in the Mediterranean will send in planes. They’ll carpet bomb the area. It’ll start a war, sir. If we don’t get the plane back in twenty four hours... they’ll have a chance to organize a ﬁrst strike. Or duplicate the Nova’s technology. The Nova drove the balance of power in their favor with nuclear strike capacity. Good luck, men. What do you got from Interpol on these people? They’re all part of a movement. It’s tied to a radical middle eastern terrorist group. Well funded organized OP. Their MO isn’t money, it’s domination of the free world by any means necessary. They’d use a nuclear bomb without a second thought. So they plan to nuke us. I'm afraid that’s what we must assume. There’s an airstrip here. Bridge, small village. We’re somewhere here. Shit. What are you thinking? We move to plan B. I want you to stick with the stealth. I may need air support. I need the pictures. Now, Wait, wait, wait. You think that’s a good idea? Well, you got a better one? Move. You could give me a few minutes. Shit. The plane went down somewhere over here. Vit! Stay with the plane, that’s a great idea. -Let's go. -We go. Ah shit. -And there’s no response to radio calls? -None at all, sir. This is Admiral Pendleton US Navy. We’ve lost all contact with Connors and Jannick. Sir, we’ve lost radio contact with Connors and Jannick. Damn. Halt, stop or I will shoot. According to the CIA this region is run by the Graebner/Stone Terrorist Group. They make Bahder-Minhoff look like a bunch of school yard bullies. I want everything the CIA has on them. Right, sir. What do we have here? It looks like an American pilot. So, Mr Pilot, where is your plane? I parachuted in. I’m a sky diver. You didn’t have to use this, eh? I always land on my feet. Where is the plane? -Why don’t you kiss my ass? -I will kill you. What are you waiting for, asshole? Sir. We found the plane. An American SR71. Stone, this is Elias. What is it, Mr Elias? We have found the pilot. And an American SR71. You found an American SR71? Interesting. Another man was seen near the woods. We’re searching for him now. -Bring in the pilot. -And the SR71? I'll bring it in. It’s being taken care of, Mr Elias. CIA made me jump through hoops for this stuff. Okay, Petar Stone, son of a wealthy industrialist. Joined a skinhead faction at 16 where he met Jose Graebner... Skip the bio’s, Colonel. Okay, CIA has been monitoring terrorist weapons buys, lately there’s been a change in methods. Which is? They’ve been networking. Forming buyers clubs. What are you telling me, Colonel? Terrorists are getting 10 percent off on their guns? No, sir, group like Graebner and Stone are joining forces... to buy weapons of mass destruction. Nuclear? At the very least, sir, they could be chemical or biological. -Pass me through to Admiral Pendleton. -Yes, sir. This is Admiral Pendleton, US Navy. Yes, Admiral. We’ve conﬁrmed they have nukes. Jesus. We can send in our planes on a ﬂy over. Negative, Admiral. I don’t want to spook those people into hiding the plane. If our team can’t get it back we’ll have to go ahead with the bombing, -Destroy it, and anyone who’s seen it. -Copy that. Thank you, Admiral. Good evening, my friend. I'm so glad you could make it. My name is Mr Stone and this is my associate, Mr Elias. And your name is? Asshole. Yes. Mr asshole. So please tell me, Mr Asshole. I have some questions to ask you about this Nova stealth ﬁghter plane. Oh, you just ask away. You let me know when you are ready to cooperate. Alright? This is Stone, what is it? We’ve located the other pilot. We need help in searching the village. I'll go take care of it. Let’s go. Elias is on his way. Shit. Don’t move. Put up your hands. Okay, okay. Step away from the door. Slowly. Drop the gun. Drop the bag. Turn around. Slowly. Who are you? Open the door. One word and I'll kill you, you understand? One word. Look at me. The door, Mela. A minute please. Just a minute. What do you want? We are searching for an American spy. I am the only one here. We’ll see. This American, has killed many of my patrol. Look if you want but there is no man here. But you have had men here before, Mela, haven’t you? That is none of your business. Everything in this town is my business. Graebner Stone’s business. You have a lot of nice things in this town, Mela. I can take them away from you. Leave you with nothing. Except my love for you. Is this what you are looking for? Perhaps I can help you ﬁnd what you want. Maybe you would like this? Yeah. What is it? I will be there. Our day will come. Remember that. You watch her. She’s a dissident, she cannot be trusted. Okay, let’s go. Nice gun collection. So you want to know why a... Why a woman like me would have so many guns. Yeah. Because of this ﬁlthy government. They parcel out our land. They give our towns and villages to these terrorists. And then they just come in here and they just take whatever they want. So some of us are trying to stop them. To take the government away from the military... and the terrorists and give... And give it back to the people. So you’re with the underground? I am their leader. Bring it up, Chris. They haven’t budged. I don’t get it. 11 hours, 52 minutes. There’s still time. Sir. Are we really going to destroy a 75 million dollar prototype war plane if they fail? I have no choice, Colonel. You're insane. Millions of people will die. That’s the point. That’s what we’re counting on. Finally, you stupid Americans with your free market invasion. You will know what it’s like to have your culture destroyed. And from the ashes of the corrupt western world, we will build a new civilization. Our primary target, The Paris Peace Talks. Presidents and Premiers from all over the world will be on hand. At ﬁrst, they’ll think it’s food poisoning. But then within 12 hours they’ll all be dead. And thanks to your Nova Stealth ﬁghter... they'll never know what hit them. Which will leave us free to go on to our second target. The State of Kansas. What is it you call it? The Heartland? Well I hope they appreciate our little heart attack. You know, we’ll be ﬂying in two days. -It’s a pity you’ll be dead. -We’ll see who'll be dead, asshole. Maybe the arrogant American pilot... knows something that I don’t know. Maybe a smart man would move his mission forward. This is Stone, fuel the planes. We ﬂy this morning. You people are too stupid to ﬂy that plane. Ah yes, but I’ve thought of everything. I’ve recently acquired a very gifted American pilot. Ratcher? So how is my favorite student? Shame you missed your funeral, it was real touching. I wasn’t talking about you, Richard. How’s my old buddy Vince Connors? I need to get to this airstrip, right here. This is a very difﬁcult region to get to now. They have patrols guarding everywhere. They will be searching for you. There will be a check point right here, and another one right here. Yes, I know. And another one right here. Look, it’s almost morning. I’m running out of time. No, this is impossible in the daytime. You will be captured, they'll kill you. I will make it through. That’s not what I wanted to hear. You're being crazy. Look, in six hours and twenty eight minutes... they're gonna carpet bomb this place. Do you know what that means? You are going to destroy my country. Yes. Yes. The decision, thank god, I didn’t have to make. And I’m sorry. I’m truly sorry. I’ve got to go. Thank you. Wait. My cousin, Rojar, he has a fruit truck. Who is it? It is your cousin Rojar. I bring you melons. Rojar. Oh, Rojari Ber. Friend, you have American cigarettes? You send me American cigarettes we both make a lot of money. Sure. And Coca-cola. Yea, get in here. Get in Get in. Hey, What are you doing? Selling fresh produce. Melons, oranges, onions. Here. For you. -American cigarettes? -No. I go before they spoil. Jeber, produce king. I want these armed and loaded now. -How much longer? -It’ll be ready. Be in the air in one hour. Hey, tell me, you like American cowboy? Shut up, Rojar. What about the check point? Check point? We drive straight through. What if they search the truck? Then we ﬁnd out if old fruit cart can out run motorcycles. Good morning, General, I have produce, fresh for your pilots. I must hurry before the sun wilts them. Let me see your papers. You are not_a general, you’re a private. Rojar Jeber, the produce king. I deliver produce to the colonel himself. Here. -This is for you and your friend. -Let’s check your cargo. Don’t check my cargo. Don’t put your dirty hands on my cargo. Don’t you mix up everything, chickpeas, carrots, onions, don’t! -Should have put in new spark plugs. -Fine. -They’re gaining. -You go like wind you ancient cart. Rojar, drive faster. Get my gun. Get him, Rojar, get him. He’s gaining on us. Dammit. -Kick him. -Yeah, but.. Use stranglehold. Stop. Stop. Tum it around. Turn it around. What? Are you crazy? Go back. Right. Right. There's only two hours left on the clock, sir. Is the carrier on station? Yes, sir. The Admiral's giving the wing commanders his ﬁnal brieﬁng right now. Good. Sir, I’ve got the best ﬁghter pilots waiting for immediate departure on your command. Our information leads us to believe the President will upgrade the situation to Defcon 3. It is therefore imperative that you take out Stone... before the Nova can launch. Make sure that you burn it all, nothing left. Sir, what’s our primary target? Take out the airﬁeld, the hangar and any outbuildings in the vicinity. Yes, sir. Good luck, Lieutenant. You may be out last line of defense. Yes, sir, I’ll get my men in the air immediately. Get me the President. The planes are out in the wide open. Yeah. They probably got Jannick in that hangar. So why do you help this man? Who is he to you? A friend? Deﬁnitely not a friend. You do not like this man but you risk yourself to rescue him. He’s my partner, I'm not leaving without him. Even if it kills you? I’d rather die doing what’s right than live doing what’s wrong. You’re a good man. I wish there were more men like you in my country. Thank you. I thought the American cowboy no kiss girl. Sometimes they do. Sir, Connors and Jannick are still in the area. I know, Colonel, they still have two hours left. We have to give them time to get the Nova back intact. If they do, I'll call it off. If not... This is squadron leader. Our ETA to. Target is one hour four seven minutes. Our orders are to roast and toast. No survivors. Patrol to Stone, Patrol to Stone. What is it? Sir, we are being attacked. -It’s Connors. -Come. -You’re dead, Ratcher. -Guard him. You’re both dead. Behind you! -Mela. -Yeah? Mela. Get up. You two, Men, Come here! You okay? Never better. You shouldn’t have come here. You should have gotten your ass in that plane and gotten the hell out of here. Your life was in my hands, remember? I didn’t tell them anything. I know. -Can you ﬂy? -Like a bird. Good, I’m going to need cover ﬁre and that Nova’s no UAB. Vince, Ratcher’s alive. He stole the Nova, faked his own death. How do you know that? Because I saw the asshole. He’s going to ﬂy the bombing mission for them. He’s as sick as they are. Shit. I got more ammo. Let’s go. Come on. So, this is your day. The day you die. Ratcher, the plane. Go, go now. Cover me. Shit. Now. Move. Go. Mela. OK, ETA to target is two, three minutes. Look alive guys, look sharp. Keep your eagles open, don’t want no surprises. Jannick. No. No. Jannick. I’m about up now, partner. Come on. Common, we’re going. No. You try to take me out of here we’re both going to die. No. You give me the slaver. Blow this place to hell. Come on. You give them hell, partner. You give them, Hell. Ratch. Put the gun down. I said put it down. Vincent, nice to see you again. -What the hell are you doing, Ratch? -Getting rich. Getting rich? Do you know how much I’m getting paid for this? This is treason, Ratch. This is treason. Connors has escaped. Let’s go take back our life. Attention, GS squadron leader. This is GS squadron leader. The American has stolen my Nova plane. Shoot him down. I repeat, shoot him down. Copy that, missile armed and ready. Common! Come on, come on. My old friend Mr Jannick. Not so arrogant now, huh? Time to die, Captain. Wait, I’ve got something for you. Jannick’s little parting gift. Courtesy of the United States Air Force. Asshole. Hey, Kemosabe. Kemosabe. We did it. Edwards, this is Black Thunder. Connors, do you read? Vince, General Barnes. Go ahead. General, the good news is I have the Nova. I am at seventeen point 0 four three degrees east. And the Tropic of the Cancer, headed north. Roger, Vince, copy that. What's the bad news? I'm carrying two big NBC bombs. I’m afraid if I take a hit and go down I take half a continent with me. Roger, Vince, stand by one. You were right, sir. Those bombs have biological capacity as well as nuclear. Give me all the information on possible fallout scenarios, Colonel. Yes, sir. Vince, we’ve got a squadron ﬁve minutes east of you. I can’t go east, I got Ratcher on my six. Ratcher? Ratcher’s dead. No, sir, he faked his death to steal the Nova. Sorry. Sir, I’ve got to cut you out. I got Ratcher on my tail. You are entering French airspace, please identify yourself. If you do not identify yourself you will be shot down. Do you understand? Do not shoot, I repeat, do not shoot. I'm an American Air Force pilot being chased by unfriendly aircraft. Vince, you’ve got to keep Ratcher off your tail. Help’s on the way, Just hold on for three more minutes. Give it up, Vincent, you know I’m the better pilot. Hey, Ratchet, I’ve picked up a few tricks since then, I think you’ll like them. Tricks. That’s all they are, Vincent. I can out-fly you in a school bus. One well placed hit might take the whole plane down. Take Europe down. Stone’s dead, Tom, there’s no one to pay for this. I’ve already been paid. Have you perished, make nice the revenge. Drop the load, Vincent, I’ll let you live? We could be partners. Why ﬂy against each other when we can ﬂy together? Kill millions of people? Come on, Ratch, for what? For millions of dollars. What do you care about those people? From up here, they’re nothing. So small you can’t even see them. If you could get a hundred dollars for each one who died. Sorry, Tom, no deal. I’m the one who’s sorry. If Nova’s shot down over Europe the gas will spread like this. 12 hours. 24 hours. 36 hours. 48 hours. Jesus. You can’t hit me cause you can’t see me, Ratch. I don’t have to see you, Vincent, I just have to predict where you are. Shit, heat seekers. It’s right behind you, Connors. Hey, Ratch. You taught me, you taught Jannick. But you forgot to teach yourself. Edwards, this is Black Thunder. Do you read? Threat neutralized. I'm on my way home. Admiral, the situation is diffused. You can call off your boys. Great, great. Mike, you can call off the B-3's. The job has been taken care of. And damn well taken care of if I may say so. Vince, great job. Sony, red. Connors got them this time, we’ll get them next time. Let’s take it home. -Good job, Colonel. -You too, sir. Let’s get a drink. How are you doing? Welcome back, Vince. Sorry to hear about Captain Jannick. Thank you, sir, he's a good man. Vince, they’ll be a medal in this for you. Sir... If anyone deserves a medal, It’s Jannick. Give it to him, sir. Hell of a mission, sir. I didn’t think he could pull it off. You’re damn right, Colonel. I hate to mention this now, sir, but there’s one more thing. Yes, what is it? That SR71. It’s still out in the Libyan desert, sir. You're right. And there’s only one man who can go in and get it. Oh, Vince.
