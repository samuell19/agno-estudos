Man: APRIL 8, 1804. HONORED PARENTS, I AM NOW ON AN EXPEDITION TO THE WESTWARD THROUGH THE INTERIOR PARTS OF NORTH AMERICA WITH CAPTAIN LEWIS AND CAPTAIN CLARK. WE ARE TO ASCEND THE MISSOURI RIVER WITH A BOAT AS FAR AS IT IS NAVIGABLE AND THEN GO BY LAND TO THE WESTERN OCEAN, IF NOTHING PREVENTS. Narrator: ONE AFTERNOON IN THE SPRING OF 1804, NEARLY 4 DOZEN MEN CROSSED THE MISSISSIPPI AND STARTED UP THE MISSOURI RIVER, STRUGGLING AGAINST ITS THICK, MUDDY CURRENT. Man: WE EXPECT TO BE GONE 18 MONTHS OR TWO YEARS, AND IF WE MAKE GREAT DISCOVERIES-- AS WE EXPECT-- THE UNITED STATES HAS PROMISED TO MAKE US GREAT REWARDS. FOR FEAR OF ACCIDENTS, I WISH TO INFORM YOU THAT I LEFT $200 IN CASH, AND IF I SHOULD NOT LIVE TO RETURN, MY HEIRS CAN GET THAT AND ALL THE PAY DUE ME FROM THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. I WILL WRITE NEXT WINTER IF I HAVE A CHANCE. SERGEANT JOHN ORDWAY. Narrator: THEY WERE BEGINNING THE MOST IMPORTANT EXPEDITION IN AMERICAN HISTORY-- THE UNITED STATES' FIRST OFFICIAL EXPLORATION INTO UNKNOWN SPACES AND A GLIMPSE INTO THE FUTURE OF THEIR YOUNG NATION. THEY WOULD BECOME THE FIRST UNITED STATES CITIZENS TO EXPERIENCE THE GREAT PLAINS-- THE IMMENSITY OF ITS SKIES, THE RICH SPLENDOR OF ITS WILDLIFE, THE HARSH RIGORS OF ITS WINTERS. THEY WOULD BE THE FIRST AMERICAN CITIZENS TO SEE THE DAUNTING PEAKS OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS, THE FIRST TO STRUGGLE OVER THEM, THE FIRST TO CROSS THE CONTINENTAL DIVIDE TO WHERE THE RIVERS FLOW WEST. AND AFTER ENCOUNTERING COLD, HUNGER, DANGER, AND WONDERS BEYOND BELIEF, THEY WOULD BECOME THE FIRST OF THEIR NATION TO REACH THE PACIFIC OCEAN BY LAND. IT WOULD BE THE GREATEST ADVENTURE OF THEIR LIVES. Man: IT'S A GREAT STORY. IT'S A HUMAN STORY. IT'S A STORY OF THOSE WHO WENT FIRST. THEY WERE FIRST. THEY LED THE WAY. THEY OPENED THE TRAIL. Man: THE BEST AUTHENTICATED ACCOUNTS INFORMED US THAT WE WERE TO PASS THROUGH A COUNTRY POSSESSED BY NUMEROUS POWERFUL AND WARLIKE NATIONS OF SAVAGES OF GIGANTIC STATURE, FIERCE, TREACHEROUS, AND CRUEL... AND PARTICULARLY HOSTILE TO WHITE MEN. SERGEANT PATRICK GASS. Narrator: THEY WOULD TELL PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN OCCUPYING THE LAND FOR HUNDREDS OF GENERATIONS THAT THE WEST NOW BELONGED TO SOMEONE ELSE, YET THEY WOULD MEET MORE FRIENDS THAN ENEMIES AND ONLY ONCE FIRE THEIR GUNS IN ANGER. THEY CARRIED THE MOST MODERN WEAPONS OF THEIR TIME, BUT IN THEIR TWO MOMENTS OF GREATEST NEED, WOMEN WOULD INTERVENE ON THEIR BEHALF, AND TIME AND TIME AGAIN, THEY WOULD BE SAVED BY THE KINDNESS OF STRANGERS. THEY WERE LED BY TWO UTTERLY DIFFERENT MEN-- ONE OUTGOING AND SELF-CONFIDENT, THE OTHER BRILLIANT BUT TROUBLED. REPRESENTING A NEW NATION THAT CELEBRATED INDIVIDUAL ACHIEVEMENT, THEY WOULD RELY INSTEAD ON COOPERATION AND TEAMWORK. THEY CALLED THEMSELVES THE CORPS OF DISCOVERY, YET THEY WOULD FAIL TO DISCOVER THE THING THEY HAD BEEN SENT MOST OF ALL TO FIND. THEIR REAL DISCOVERY WOULD BE THE LAND ITSELF AND THE PROMISES IT HELD. Man: IT'S AMERICA'S STORY, I THINK. THEY TURNED THE NATION AND FACED IT WEST, AND THAT'S WHERE THE FUTURE HAS ALWAYS BEEN. THAT'S WHERE HOPE AND POSSIBILITY HAVE BEEN. AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT DRAWS US TO LEWIS AND CLARK. IT'S ABOUT POSSIBILITIES. IT'S ABOUT WHAT COULD BE-- SOMETIMES WHAT IS AND SOMETIMES WHAT ISN'T. BUT IT'S ABOUT POTENTIAL, THE FUTURE, AND HOPE. Man: CONFIDENTIAL-- GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE AND OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, THE RIVER MISSOURI AND THE INDIANS INHABITING IT ARE NOT AS WELL-KNOWN AS IS DESIRABLE. AN INTELLIGENT OFFICER WITH 10 OR 12 CHOSEN MEN MIGHT EXPLORE THE WHOLE LINE, EVEN TO THE WESTERN OCEAN. THE APPROPRIATION OF $2,500 WOULD COVER THE UNDERTAKING. THOMAS JEFFERSON. Narrator: IN 1801, WHEN THOMAS JEFFERSON BECAME PRESIDENT, 2 OUT OF EVERY 3 AMERICANS LIVED WITHIN 50 MILES OF THE ATLANTIC OCEAN. ONLY 4 ROADS CROSSED THE ALLEGHENY MOUNTAINS. THE UNITED STATES ENDED AT THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER. JEFFERSON HAD ALWAYS BEEN CURIOUS ABOUT THE WEST. HIS PERSONAL LIBRARY AT MONTICELLO CONTAINED MORE BOOKS ABOUT THE REGION THAN ANY OTHER LIBRARY IN THE WORLD, BUT HIS BOOKS TOLD HIM OF A WEST WHERE WOOLLY MAMMOTHS STILL ROAMED, OF ERUPTING VOLCANOES, HILLS OF PURE SALT, AND BLUE-EYED INDIANS WHO SPOKE WELSH. JEFFERSON'S BOOKS ALSO DESCRIBED A NORTHWEST PASSAGE-- AN EASY WATER ROUTE SOMEWHERE FAR BEYOND THE MISSISSIPPI THAT WOULD LINK THE ATLANTIC WITH THE PACIFIC, MAKE POSSIBLE DIRECT TRADE WITH ALL THE ORIENT, AND UNLOCK THE WEALTH OF NORTH AMERICA. SINCE THE TIME OF COLUMBUS, THE SPANISH, FRENCH, AND BRITISH HAD BEEN SEARCHING FOR IT. WHICHEVER NATION DISCOVERED THE PASSAGE AND CONTROLLED IT, JEFFERSON WAS CERTAIN, WOULD CONTROL THE DESTINY OF THE CONTINENT. TO LEAD HIS AMERICAN EXPEDITION, JEFFERSON TURNED TO HIS 28-YEAR-OLD PERSONAL SECRETARY, MERIWETHER LEWIS. A SKILLED FRONTIERSMAN AND AMATEUR SCIENTIST, LEWIS HAD GROWN UP WITHIN SIGHT OF MONTICELLO AND HAD MADE A NAME FOR HIMSELF AS A PROMISING ARMY OFFICER BEFORE JEFFERSON SUMMONED HIM TO WASHINGTON. INITIALLY, I THINK, JEFFERSON IS THE PERSON WHO PUT HIS SPIRIT AND A GOOD PIECE OF HIS MIND-- THIS DEISTIC RATIONALISM-- INTO THE BRAIN OF MERIWETHER LEWIS, AND IN MANY WAYS IN THE MONTHS BEFORE THE EXPEDITION, IT WAS JEFFERSON WHO BECAME SOMETHING OF MERIWETHER LEWIS' FATHER-- HELPED REMAKE THIS MAN. Narrator: SOME CONSIDERED LEWIS AN UNLIKELY CHOICE FOR SUCH AN IMPORTANT EXPEDITION. HE SOMETIMES DRANK TOO MUCH, AND JEFFERSON HIMSELF HAD NOTED WHAT HE CALLED "OCCASIONAL DEPRESSIONS OF THE MIND" IN LEWIS, BUT HE STILL CONSIDERED HIM THE BEST MAN FOR THE JOB. LEWIS IN TURN ASKED AN OLD FRIEND TO HELP HIM LEAD THE EXPEDITION. Meriwether Lewis: MY FRIEND, IF THERE IS ANYTHING IN THIS ENTERPRISE WHICH WOULD INDUCE YOU TO PARTICIPATE WITH ME IN ITS FATIGUES, ITS DANGERS, AND ITS HONORS, BELIEVE ME-- THERE IS NO MAN ON EARTH WITH WHOM I SHOULD FEEL EQUAL PLEASURE IN SHARING THEM AS WITH YOURSELF. Narrator: HIS FRIEND WAS WILLIAM CLARK. BORN IN VIRGINIA, HE HAD SPENT MOST OF HIS LIFE ON THE OHIO AND KENTUCKY FRONTIER, WHERE HE HAD LEARNED BOTH TO FIGHT AND TO NEGOTIATE WITH INDIANS. HE WAS, ONE ACQUAINTANCE SAID, "OF SOLID AND PROMISING PARTS AND AS BRAVE AS CAESAR." CLARK WAS 4 YEARS OLDER THAN LEWIS AND HAD ONCE BEEN HIS COMMANDER. HE WAS LESS FORMALLY EDUCATED, BUT WITH MORE PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE AND A STEADIER TEMPERAMENT. Man: DEAR LEWIS, THIS IS AN UNDERTAKING FRAUGHT WITH MANY DIFFICULTIES, BUT, MY FRIEND, I DO ASSURE YOU THAT NO MAN LIVES WITH WHOM I WOULD PREFER TO TAKE SUCH A TRIP. MY FRIEND, I JOIN YOU WITH HAND AND HEART. WILLIAM CLARK. I THINK IF WILLIAM CLARK WALKED INTO THIS ROOM RIGHT NOW, THAT--THAT INSTANTLY I WOULD LIKE HIM A LOT. I THINK HE'S AN INCREDIBLY BRIGHT GUY. HE WAS INVENTIVE. HE WAS A LITTLE LAID BACK. HE DIDN'T TEND TO GET AS UPSET ABOUT THINGS AS LEWIS DID. I THINK LEWIS KNEW THAT HE NEEDED SOMEBODY TO HELP HIM ON THE EXPEDITION. I THINK SOMEWHERE DEEP DOWN HE KNEW THAT HE NEEDED SOMEBODY HE COULD COUNT ON, AND THE PERSON HE COULD COUNT THE MOST ON WAS WILLIAM CLARK. THEY'RE TWO VERY DIFFERENT MEN, BUT THEY FORM A UNIT, AND I THINK AT THE CORE OF THE LEWIS AND CLARK EXPEDITION IS A BOND, A FRIENDSHIP, A BROTHERHOOD BETWEEN TWO VERY DIFFERENT MEN. Narrator: IN THE SPRING OF 1803, AT JEFFERSON'S URGING, LEWIS WENT TO PHILADELPHIA, HOME OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY. THERE HE STUDIED FOR MONTHS WITH THE NATION'S LEADING SCIENTISTS, LEARNING BOTANY, ZOOLOGY, MINERALOGY, AND CELESTIAL NAVIGATION. HE BEGAN BUYING SUPPLIES-- GUNPOWDER, LEAD, AND RIFLES OF THE MOST ADVANCED DESIGN, SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS, TENTS, AND WOOLEN BLANKETS, GIFTS FOR THE INDIAN TRIBES HE EXPECTED TO MEET, AND BARRELS OF WHISKEY. HE LEARNED MEDICINE FROM THE MOST CELEBRATED PHYSICIAN OF THE DAY-- DR. BENJAMIN RUSH-- AND BOUGHT FROM HIM 600 DOSES OF THE DOCTOR'S FAVORITE CURE-ALL-- POWERFUL LAXATIVES EVERYONE CALLED "RUSH'S THUNDERBOLTS." [FIREWORKS AND CHEERING] THEN, ON JULY 4, 1803, CAME NEWS THAT DRAMATICALLY EXPANDED THE EXPEDITION'S IMPORTANCE. NAPOLEON BONAPARTE, THE EMPEROR OF FRANCE, HAD OFFERED TO SELL THE LOUISIANA TERRITORY-- THE VAST AREA BETWEEN THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER AND THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS-- TO THE UNITED STATES FOR $15 MILLION. IT WAS A SUM NEARLY TWICE THE FEDERAL BUDGET, BUT JEFFERSON NEVER HESITATED. FOR JUST 3 CENTS AN ACRE, HE MORE THAN DOUBLED THE SIZE OF HIS COUNTRY. IT WAS THE GREATEST LAND DEAL IN HISTORY. Ambrose: JEFFERSON HAD A MIND THAT ENCOMPASSED THE CONTINENT, AND HE ENVISIONED THE CREATION OF A GREAT NATION THAT WOULD STRETCH FROM SEA TO SEA, THAT WOULD BE BOUND TOGETHER BY A POLITICAL CONCEPT-- THE IDEA OF LIBERTY-- AND HE WANTED TO SPREAD THAT LIBERTY ALL THE WAY OUT TO THE WEST COAST. Narrator: AT LEAST ON PAPER, NEARLY HALF OF THE WEST NOW BELONGED TO THE UNITED STATES, BUT IT WAS STILL A CONTESTED AREA. SPAIN CONTROLLED TEXAS, CALIFORNIA, AND ALL OF THE SOUTHWEST. ENGLAND HAD CANADA AND A CLAIM ON THE OREGON COUNTRY, AND IN THE FALL OF 1803, AS MERIWETHER LEWIS AND HIS FRIEND WILLIAM CLARK MADE THEIR WAY TO THE EASTERN SIDE OF THE MISSISSIPPI, NO ONE KNEW FOR SURE WHAT THOMAS JEFFERSON HAD JUST BOUGHT. THE CAPTAINS WOULD SPEND THE WINTER OUTFITTING THEIR BIG KEELBOAT AND ASSEMBLING THE ROUGH AND UNDISCIPLINED FRONTIERSMEN WHO WOULD MAKE UP WHAT THEIR PRESIDENT CALLED "THE CORPS OF DISCOVERY." Thomas Jefferson: CAPTAIN LEWIS, THE OBJECT OF YOUR MISSION IS TO EXPLORE THE MISSOURI RIVER AND SUCH PRINCIPAL STREAM OF IT AS BY ITS COURSE AND COMMUNICATION WITH THE WATERS OF THE PACIFIC OCEAN MAY OFFER THE MOST DIRECT AND PRACTICABLE WATER COMMUNICATION ACROSS THIS CONTINENT. THE ACQUISITION OF THE COUNTRY THROUGH WHICH YOU ARE TO PASS HAS INSPIRED THE PUBLIC GENERALLY WITH A GREAT DEAL OF INTEREST IN YOUR ENTERPRISE. PRESENT MY SALUTATIONS TO MR. CLARK. ASSURE ALL YOUR PARTY THAT WE HAVE OUR EYES TURNED ON THEM WITH ANXIETY FOR THEIR SAFETY. THOMAS JEFFERSON. Narrator: ON MAY 14, 1804, THE CORPS OF DISCOVERY LEFT THEIR WINTER ENCAMPMENT IN ILLINOIS, CROSSED THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER, AND FINALLY HEADED UP THE MISSOURI. Allen: WHEN THE ASTRONAUTS WENT TO THE MOON, THEY'D SEEN PICTURES OF IT. THEY KNEW WHAT TO EXPECT. WHEN LEWIS AND CLARK HEADED OUT, THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE SLIGHTEST NOTION OF WHAT TO EXPECT. IT WAS MORE UNKNOWN TO THEM THAN TO THE ASTRONAUTS. Man: MAY 25th-- SET OUT EARLY THIS MORNING AND PROCEEDED ON. PASSED A FRENCH VILLAGE CALLED LA CHARRETTE. THIS IS THE LAST SETTLEMENT OF WHITES ON THIS RIVER. SERGEANT CHARLES FLOYD. Narrator: SERGEANT CHARLES FLOYD WAS A 22-YEAR-OLD KENTUCKIAN-- "A YOUNG MAN OF MUCH MERIT," LEWIS NOTED. BEYOND THAT, NOT MUCH IS KNOWN ABOUT FLOYD OR THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE CREW-- "STOUT, HEALTHY, UNMARRIED MEN," LEWIS CALLED THEM, "ACCUSTOMED TO THE WOODS AND CAPABLE OF BEARING BODILY FATIGUE." THEY CAME FROM NEARLY EVERY CORNER OF THE NATION. JOHN ORDWAY WAS A YOUNG SOLDIER FROM HEBRON, NEW HAMPSHIRE. JOSEPH WHITEHOUSE WAS A TAILOR FROM VIRGINIA, AND PATRICK GASS WAS A CARPENTER WHO CAME FROM IRISH STOCK IN PENNSYLVANIA. REUBEN AND JOSEPH FIELD WERE BROTHERS. GEORGE DROUILLARD, FRANCOIS LABICHE, AND PIERRE CRUZATTE WERE THE SONS OF WHITE FATHERS AND INDIAN MOTHERS. IN ADDITION, LEWIS TOOK WITH HIM HIS BIG NEWFOUNDLAND DOG... AND WILLIAM CLARK BROUGHT ALONG A SLAVE HE HAD OWNED SINCE CHILDHOOD, A BLACK MAN NAMED YORK. Meriwether Lewis: SUCH IS THE VELOCITY OF THE CURRENT THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO RESIST ITS FORCE BY MEANS OF OARS OR POLES IN THE MAIN CHANNEL OF THE RIVER. THE EDDIES, THEREFORE, WHICH GENERALLY EXIST ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER OF THE RIVER ARE SOUGHT BY THE NAVIGATOR, BUT THE BASE OF THE RIVERBANKS, BEING COMPOSED OF A FINE, LIGHT SAND, IS EASILY REMOVED BY THE WATER, AND THE BANKS, BEING UNABLE TO SUPPORT THEMSELVES LONGER, TUMBLE INTO THE RIVER WITH TREMENDOUS FORCE, DESTROYING EVERYTHING WITHIN THEIR REACH. MERIWETHER LEWIS. Narrator: THE BIG KEELBOAT WAS RAMMED BY DRIFTING LOGS, GOT STUCK ON SAND BARS, HAD ITS MAST SNAPPED BY OVERHANGING TREES. OFTEN THE ONLY WAY TO PROCEED WAS FOR THE MEN TO WADE ALONG THE MUDDY BANKS AND PULL THE BOAT WITH A ROPE. Allen: THE MISSOURI RIVER WAS A BIG, BROAD, WILD, TOUGH RIVER IN THOSE DAYS. THEY'D GET UP IN THE MORNING, AND THEN THEY'D HAVE TO GET THIS BIG, HEAVY KEELBOAT-- HAD TONS AND TONS OF SUPPLIES IN IT. THEY HAD TO GET IT AGAINST THE CURRENT. CURRENT'S GOING 5, 6 MILES AN HOUR-- JUST PUSHING THEM, TRYING TO PUSH THEM BACK TO THE MISSISSIPPI, AND EVERY DAY THEY'VE GOT TO GO A LITTLE BIT FARTHER. Narrator: 14 MILES WAS A GOOD DAY'S PROGRESS, BUT AFTER TWO LONG MONTHS, THEY WERE STILL IN WHAT IS NOW MISSOURI. Heat-Moon: I HAVE NOT BEEN ON ANY RIVER THAT HAS MORE OF A DISTINCTIVE PERSONALITY THAN DOES THE MISSOURI RIVER. IT'S A RIVER THAT IMMEDIATELY PRESENTS TO THE TRAVELER, "I AM A GRANDFATHER SPIRIT. I HAVE A SOURCE. I HAVE A LIFE." I THINK THAT THAT GRANDFATHER SPIRIT OF THE MISSOURI RIVER HELPED DRAW THEM ON. YOU'RE GOING AGAINST THE SNAGS AND THE SAWYERS AND THE SAND BARS. YOU'RE GOING AGAINST THE TREACHERY OF THE RIVER, BUT YOU ALSO ARE GOING AGAINST THIS RIVER WHICH SEEMS TO SAY TO THE TRAVELER, "COME UP ME." [GUNSHOT] Narrator: EACH DAY, GEORGE DROUILLARD, THE EXPEDITION'S BEST SHOT, WENT OUT TO HUNT FOR FRESH MEAT. SILAS GOODRICH, THE BEST FISHERMAN, CAUGHT BASS, PERCH, AND CATFISH. THE FOOD THEY BROUGHT IN SUPPLEMENTED THE DAILY RATION OF CORNMEAL, FLOUR, AND SALT PORK THAT JOHN ORDWAY DISTRIBUTED WITH 4 OUNCES OF WHISKEY. CLARK SPENT MOST DAYS ON THE KEELBOAT, CALCULATING THEIR PROGRESS BY DEAD RECKONING, ESTIMATING THE DISTANCE TO A COTTONWOOD TREE AT THE NEXT BEND OF THE RIVER, THEN THE NEXT AND THE NEXT, AS HE COMPILED A MAP FOR JEFFERSON. LEWIS OFTEN GATHERED PLANTS, TOOK SAMPLES OF THE SOIL, AND TENDED TO THE MEN'S AILMENTS BY DRAWING BLOOD FROM HIS PATIENTS AND LIBERALLY DISPENSING RUSH'S THUNDERBOLTS. IT WAS A PILL THAT DR. BENJAMIN RUSH HAD WORKED UP AND THAT HE SAID WAS SOVEREIGN FOR ALMOST EVERYTHING. IT WAS A PURGATIVE THAT IS WELL DESCRIBED BY THE TERM "THUNDERBOLTS," AND IT WAS THE MEDICINE OF CHOICE FOR ALMOST ANY AILMENT. USUALLY, IT WAS ALMOST CERTAINLY THE WRONG THING TO USE, BUT THEY USED IT CONSTANTLY, AND THEY BELIEVED IN IT, AND IT SURE DID CLEAN THEM OUT. Narrator: THE EXPEDITION MARKED THE FIRST FOURTH OF JULY EVER CELEBRATED WEST OF THE MISSISSIPPI... [CANNON FIRES] BY FIRING THE KEELBOAT'S CANNON AND DRINKING AN EXTRA RATION OF WHISKEY. THE CAPTAINS NAMED A STREAM THAT THEY PASSED INDEPENDENCE CREEK. "THE DAY," JOSEPH WHITEHOUSE REMARKED IN HIS JOURNAL, "WAS MIGHTY HOT." Duncan: IT WAS HOT, IT WAS TOUGH GOING, AND WHAT DO THEY COMPLAIN ABOUT? WHAT EVERY PERSON WHO GOES OUT AND CAMPS COMPLAINS ABOUT--BUGS. THERE WERE GNATS ALWAYS FLYING AROUND THEIR FACE... BUT MOSTLY IT WAS MOSQUITOES. THE DOG WAS HOWLING AT NIGHT, YOU LEARN, BECAUSE OF THE MOSQUITOES, AND THEY STRUGGLED TO TRY TO EVEN DESCRIBE WHAT THEY WERE LIKE. THEY START OFF BEING, "THE MOSQUITOES WERE TROUBLESOME." THEN HE SAYS, "MOSQUITOES VERY TROUBLESOME," THEN "MOSQUITOES UNCOMMONLY TROUBLESOME," THEN "MOSQUITOES EXCEEDINGLY TROUBLESOME," AND FINALLY, "MOSQUITOES IMMENSELY NUMEROUS AND TROUBLESOME." IT WAS JUST--THEY WERE THE BANE OF THEIR EXISTENCE. Thomas Jefferson: CAPTAIN LEWIS, YOUR OBSERVATIONS ARE TO BE TAKEN WITH GREAT PAINS AND ACCURACY, TO BE ENTERED DISTINCTLY AND INTELLIGIBLY FOR OTHERS AS WELL AS YOURSELF TO COMPREHEND. THOMAS JEFFERSON. Narrator: IN HIS INSTRUCTIONS TO LEWIS, PRESIDENT JEFFERSON HAD INSISTED THAT THE EXPEDITION WRITE DOWN EVERYTHING THEY EXPERIENCED. AT CAMP EVERY NIGHT, THE CAPTAINS, THE SERGEANTS, AND AT LEAST ONE OF THE PRIVATES TOOK OUT THEIR JOURNALS TO RECORD THE DAY'S EVENTS, MAKE OBSERVATIONS ON THE WEATHER, WILDLIFE, AND LANDSCAPE. Heat-Moon: WITHOUT THE JOURNALS, WE WOULDN'T REALLY HAVE AN EXPEDITION TODAY. IT WOULD BE LIKE ALL THE OTHER EXPEDITIONS THAT WENT OUT THERE, BUT WITH THOSE JOURNALS, WE COME IN AS READING A NOVEL, ALMOST, BECAUSE THEY HAVE THAT KIND OF POWER, PARTICULARLY TO READ THE WRITING OF MERIWETHER LEWIS, WHO WAS SUCH A FINE STYLIST. Meriwether Lewis: THIS IMMENSE RIVER, SO FAR AS WE HAVE YET ASCENDED, WATERS ONE OF THE FAIREST PORTIONS OF THE GLOBE. NOR DO I BELIEVE THAT THERE IS IN THE UNIVERSE A SIMILAR EXTENT OF COUNTRY. MERIWETHER LEWIS. Narrator: BUT DESPITE JEFFERSON'S ORDERS AND FOR REASONS NOT ENTIRELY KNOWN, THERE ARE LONG LAPSES IN LEWIS' JOURNALS DURING WHICH NO DAILY ENTRIES CAN BE FOUND. Ambrose: JEFFERSON SPOKE TO THE MELANCHOLY STREAK THAT RAN IN THE FAMILY, AND HE CERTAINLY WAS A MAN WHO COULD FALL INTO A DEEP DEPRESSION. AND YET HE HAD A WILLPOWER AND AN ENERGY SUFFICIENT TO OVERCOME THOSE DEPRESSIONS SO THAT ON THE EXPEDITION ITSELF, THE ONLY INDICATION WE HAVE OF DEPRESSION IS WHEN HE DOESN'T WRITE IN HIS JOURNAL, BUT THERE'S NO INDICATION AT ALL THAT IT EVER AFFECTED HIS ACTIONS, AND FOR A MANIC-DEPRESSIVE-- WHICH HE PRETTY CLEARLY WAS-- THAT TAKES A TREMENDOUS WILLPOWER TO OVERCOME THAT DEPRESSION AND CONTINUE TO ACT. Allen: I THINK HE KEPT UNDER CONTROL BECAUSE OF THE TREMENDOUS NECESSITY TO CONTINUE THE JOURNEY-- HIS GREAT WISH TO FULFILL THOMAS JEFFERSON'S HOPES. I THINK IT WAS THE FORCE OF THOMAS JEFFERSON MOVING IN MERIWETHER LEWIS THAT KEPT HIS POTENTIAL FOR DEPRESSION AND MOROSENESS UNDER CONTROL. [THUNDER] William Clark: ORDERLY BOOK, JULY 12, 1804. A COURT-MARTIAL CONSISTING OF THE TWO COMMANDING OFFICERS WILL CONVENE THIS DAY AT 1:00. PRIVATE WILLARD-- CHARGED WITH LYING DOWN AND SLEEPING ON HIS POST WHILST A SENTINEL. TO THIS CHARGE, THE PRISONER PLEADS GUILTY OF LYING DOWN, NOT GUILTY OF GOING TO SLEEP. WILLIAM CLARK. Narrator: ALONG THE LOWER MISSOURI THAT SUMMER, THE CAPTAINS CONVENED AN IMPROMPTU COURT-MARTIAL 5 DIFFERENT TIMES. Ambrose: AVERAGE AGE WAS IN THE EARLY 20s. PHYSICAL CONDITION EXCELLENT. KNOWLEDGE OF THE WILDERNESS OUTSTANDING. DEVOTION TO DUTY... THEY WERE YOUNG MEN. SOME OF THEM HAD TO HAVE SOME LASHES LAID ON-- 50, IN A COUPLE OF CASES. Narrator: NEAR WHAT IS NOW KANSAS CITY, HUGH HALL BROKE INTO THE WHISKEY SUPPLY AND GOT DRUNK. JOHN COLLINS WAS PUNISHED FOR A STRING OF OFFENSES, INCLUDING TALKING BACK TO CLARK. AND FARTHER UP RIVER, PRIVATE ALEXANDER WILLARD WAS CONVICTED OF SLEEPING ON GUARD DUTY, POTENTIALLY A CAPITAL CRIME. William Clark: THE COURT ARE OF THE OPINION THAT THE PRISONER IS GUILTY AND DO SENTENCE HIM TO RECEIVE 100 LASHES ON HIS BARE BACK AND ORDER THAT THE PUNISHMENT COMMENCE THIS EVENING AT SUNSET. Narrator: BY FALL, THERE WOULD BE NO MORE SERIOUS BREACHES OF DISCIPLINE. Charles Floyd: JULY 11-- CAME TO ABOUT 12:00 FOR THE PURPOSE OF RESTING ONE OR TWO DAYS. OUR OBJECT IN DELAYING HERE IS TO TAKE SOME OBSERVATIONS AND REST THE MEN, WHO ARE MUCH FATIGUED. THE MEN, ALL SICK. JULY 31--I AM VERY SICK AND HAVE BEEN FOR SOME TIME. WE CAMPED AT ONE OF THE BEAUTIFULLEST PRAIRIES I EVER SAW, OPEN AND BEAUTIFULLY DIVIDED, WITH HILLS AND VALLEYS ALL PRESENTING THEMSELVES. CHARLES FLOYD. Patrick Gass: AUGUST 19--THIS DAY, SERGEANT FLOYD BECAME VERY SICK AND REMAINED SO ALL NIGHT. HE WAS SEIZED WITH A COMPLAINT SOMEWHAT LIKE A VIOLENT COLIC. PATRICK GASS. William Clark: AUGUST 20--SERGEANT FLOYD MUCH WEAKER AND NO BETTER. NO PULSE, AND NOTHING WILL STAY A MOMENT ON HIS STOMACH. PASSED TWO ISLANDS, AND AT THE FIRST BLUFF ON THE STARBOARD SIDE, SERGEANT FLOYD DIED WITH A GREAT DEAL OF COMPOSURE. BEFORE HIS DEATH, HE SAID TO ME, "I AM GOING AWAY. I WANT YOU TO WRITE ME A LETTER." WILLIAM CLARK. Narrator: NEAR WHAT IS NOW SIOUX CITY, IOWA, SERGEANT CHARLES FLOYD DIED FROM WHAT LEWIS DIAGNOSED AS BILIOUS COLIC, BUT WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN A BURST APPENDIX. Ambrose: THERE WAS NOTHING THAT THEY COULD DO FOR HIM. IF HE HAD BEEN IN PHILADELPHIA WITH DR. RUSH AND THE LEADING MEDICAL MEN OF THE DAY, THERE'S NOTHING THEY COULD HAVE DONE FOR HIM, EITHER. Man: HE WAS LAID OUT IN THE MOST DECENT MANNER POSSIBLE. WE DUG A GRAVE ON THE TOP OF A ROUND KNOB AND BURIED THE DECEASED WITH THE HONORS OF WAR. THE FUNERAL CEREMONY PERFORMED, WE NAMED THIS HILL FLOYD'S BLUFF. PRIVATE JOSEPH WHITEHOUSE. William Clark: THIS MAN AT ALL TIMES GAVE US PROOFS OF HIS FIRMNESS AND DETERMINED RESOLUTION TO DO SERVICE TO HIS COUNTRY AND HONOR TO HIMSELF. AFTER PAYING ALL THE HONOR TO OUR DECEASED BROTHER, WE CAMPED IN THE MOUTH OF FLOYD'S RIVER, ABOUT 30 YARDS WIDE. A BEAUTIFUL EVENING. WILLIAM CLARK. Narrator: THE CORPS OF DISCOVERY HAD SUFFERED ITS FIRST FATALITY. Patrick Gass: THERE IS NO TIMBER IN THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY, BUT CONTINUED PRAIRIE ON BOTH SIDES OF THE RIVER. A PERSON, BY GOING ON ONE OF THE HILLS, MAY HAVE A VIEW AS FAR AS THE EYE CAN REACH WITHOUT ANY OBSTRUCTION AND ENJOY THE MOST DELIGHTFUL PROSPECTS. PATRICK GASS. Narrator: AS THEY MOVED FARTHER NORTH AND WEST, THE MEN NOTICED THE LANDSCAPE CHANGING. EXCEPT ALONG THE RIVERBANK, THERE WERE VIRTUALLY NO TREES. THE LAND SEEMED TO UNFOLD, TO ROLL ON AND ON FOREVER. THEY HAD EMERGED ONTO ONE OF THE LARGEST GRASSLANDS IN THE WORLD-- THE GREAT PLAINS. THEY HAD NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT IN THEIR LIVES. Heat-Moon: NONE OF THE EARLY TRAVELERS WHO CAME INTO THE WEST AND ENCOUNTERED THE GREAT PLAINS COULD BELIEVE WHAT THEY WERE SEEING. IT MAY BE THE FIRST COUPLE OF DAYS OF TRAVELING THEM, THEY COULD SAY, "YES, THIS IS A LARGE MEADOW. I UNDERSTAND MEADOWS, AND THIS IS JUST A BIGGER MEADOW." BUT TIME IS WHAT MAKES THE GREAT PLAINS COME ALIVE-- AND FEARFUL, ALSO, TO ANY TRAVELER, AND ESPECIALLY TO LEWIS AND CLARK. Duncan: THEY USED TO SAY A SQUIRREL COULD START AT THE ATLANTIC OCEAN AND GO FROM TREE BRANCH TO TREE BRANCH AND MAKE IT ALL THE WAY TO THE MISSISSIPPI. WHEN THEY GET ON THE GREAT PLAINS, THAT'S WHERE THE SQUIRREL STOPS. THESE ARE GUYS WHO ARE USED TO LOOKING UP AND SEEING TREES, AND NOW, NO TREES. IT MUST HAVE JUST BEEN STUPEFYING TO THEM. YOU FEEL SO SMALL. YOU FEEL LIKE THE WIND CAN BLOW YOU AND DO AT WILL WITH YOU WHAT IT WISHES. Narrator: NOW THEY BEGAN TO ENCOUNTER ANIMALS THEY HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE-- NEW ONES, IT SEEMED, ALMOST EVERY DAY. FOLLOWING JEFFERSON'S INSTRUCTIONS, THE EXPLORERS TOOK MEASUREMENTS OF EACH NEW SPECIES, NOTED THEIR HABITS, PLACED THEIR SKINS AND SKELETONS IN CRATES FOR SHIPMENT BACK TO MONTICELLO. THE DETAILED DESCRIPTIONS THE MEN WROTE DOWN IN THEIR NOTEBOOKS WERE THE FIRST EVER RECORDED FOR SCIENCE OF COYOTES, PRAIRIE WOLVES, JACK RABBITS, AND ANTELOPE. John Ordway: CAPTAIN CLARK KILLED A CURIOUS ANIMAL. IT RESEMBLES A DEER IN SOME PARTS-- THE LEGS LIKE A DEER, FEET LIKE A GOAT, HORNS LIKE A GOAT, ONLY FORKED. SUCH AN ANIMAL WAS NEVER YET KNOWN IN THE UNITED STATES. William Clark: DISCOVERED A VILLAGE OF SMALL ANIMALS THAT BURROW IN THE GROUND. IT COVERS ABOUT 4 ACRES AND CONTAINS GREAT NUMBERS OF HOLES, ON THE TOP OF WHICH THOSE LITTLE ANIMALS SIT ERECT, MAKE A WHISTLING NOISE, AND WHEN ALARMED, SLIP INTO THEIR HOLE. THOSE ANIMALS ARE CALLED BY THE FRENCH PETIT CHIEN. Duncan: THEY WERE PRAIRIE DOGS, AND THEY DECIDED, WE GOT TO HAVE ONE OF THESE. THEY TRIED TO DIG INTO THE PRAIRIE DOG HOLES, AND THEY COULDN'T GET THEM THAT WAY. THEY RAMMED RODS DOWN 6 FEET. THEY STILL COULDN'T GET THEM OUT. THEY STARTED HAULING WATER, YOU KNOW. THEY HAD EVERY MAN IN THE EXPEDITION EXCEPT A COUPLE PEOPLE GUARDING THE BOAT INVOLVED IN TRYING TO CAPTURE A PRAIRIE DOG, WHICH THEY FINALLY CAUGHT, AND THEY SENT IT BACK LIVE TO THOMAS JEFFERSON. Meriwether Lewis: THIS SCENERY, ALREADY RICH, PLEASING, AND BEAUTIFUL, WAS STILL FARTHER HEIGHTENED BY IMMENSE HERDS OF BUFFALO, WHICH WE SAW IN EVERY DIRECTION FEEDING ON THE HILLS AND PLAINS. I DO NOT THINK I EXAGGERATE WHEN I ESTIMATE THE NUMBER OF BUFFALO WHICH COULD BE COMPREHENDED AT ONE VIEW TO AMOUNT TO 3,000. Ambrose: IT WAS THE GARDEN OF EDEN. NO AMERICAN HAD EVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. BUFFALO HERDS THAT STRETCHED ACROSS THE HORIZON. ELK HERDS THAT NUMBERED IN THE HUNDREDS--INDEED, IN THE THOUSANDS. DEER SO PLENTIFUL AS CHICKENS ON A FARM, ACCORDING TO WILLIAM CLARK. THE GRAPES. THE FRUITS. THE GRASSES OF THE GREAT PLAINS. THE ROLLING HILLS OF THE MISSOURI RIVER. THE BOUNDLESS HORIZON. THIS WAS PARADISE. Thomas Jefferson: THE COMMERCE WHICH MAY BE CARRIED ON WITH THE PEOPLE INHABITING THE LINE YOU WILL PURSUE RENDERS A KNOWLEDGE OF THOSE PEOPLE IMPORTANT. YOU WILL, THEREFORE, AS FAR AS A DILIGENT PURSUIT OF YOUR JOURNEY SHALL ADMIT, ENDEAVOR TO MAKE YOURSELF ACQUAINTED. THOMAS JEFFERSON. Narrator: AS THEY MOVED UP THE RIVER THAT SUMMER IN WHAT IS NOW NEBRASKA AND SOUTH DAKOTA, THE CORPS OF DISCOVERY MET WITH SEVERAL BANDS OF NATIVE AMERICANS-- THE OTOS, THE ARIKARAS, AND THE YANKTON SIOUX. THE CAPTAINS TOLD EACH TRIBE THAT THEIR LAND NOW BELONGED TO THE UNITED STATES AND THAT A MAN FAR AWAY IN THE EAST WAS THEIR NEW GREAT FATHER. EACH ENCOUNTER WAS MARKED BY FRIENDLY RELATIONS AND FELL INTO A PREDICTABLE PATTERN OF CEREMONY. Duncan: THEY'D GIVE OUT THESE PEACE MEDALS THAT HAD JEFFERSON ON ONE SIDE AND TWO HANDS SHAKING ON THE OTHER. THEY'D GIVE OUT THESE LITTLE CERTIFICATES THAT SAY, YOU KNOW, "SPOTTED WEASEL IS NOW AN OFFICIAL CHIEF." AND THEY'D GIVE OUT PRESENTS OF MIRRORS AND CLOTH AND TOBACCO AND SOMETIMES WHISKEY, ALTHOUGH ONE TRIBE SAID, "WHY WOULD YOU GIVE US SOMETHING THAT WOULD MAKE US FOOLS?" THEN THEY WOULD SHOW OFF FOR THE TRIBES. THEY'D FIRE THEIR GUNS, AND THEY HAD A BIG CANNON THAT THEY'D SHOOT TO SAY, "WE'RE FROM A VERY MIGHTY COUNTRY." AND THEN THEY'D HAVE THE SPEECHES. William Clark: CHILDREN, THE GREAT CHIEF OF THE 17 GREAT NATIONS OF AMERICA HAS SENT US OUT TO CLEAR THE ROAD AND MAKE IT A ROAD OF PEACE. WILLIAM CLARK. Meriwether Lewis: CHILDREN, YOU ARE TO LIVE IN PEACE WITH ALL THE WHITE MEN. INJURE NOT THE PERSONS OF ANY TRADERS WHO VISIT YOU UNDER THE PROTECTION OF YOUR GREAT FATHER'S FLAG. MERIWETHER LEWIS. William Clark: CHILDREN, FOLLOW HIS COUNSELS, AND YOU WILL HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR BECAUSE THE GREAT SPIRIT WILL SMILE UPON YOUR NATION, AND IN FUTURE AGES WILL MAKE YOU OUTNUMBER THE TREES OF THE FOREST. Man: THE SPEECH THAT LEWIS AND CLARK GAVE THE TRIBES, THERE WAS A LOT OF PROMISES IN THERE. THERE WAS THE PROMISES OF FRIENDSHIP. THERE WAS PROMISES OF HELPING EACH OTHER SURVIVE. THERE WAS A PROMISE OF "THIS IS YOUR TERRITORY. "WE'RE NOT GOING TO INTERFERE WITH IT. THIS IS YOUR LIVES. WE'RE NOT GOING TO INTERFERE WITH IT." AND SO THEY BELIEVED THEM. THEY BELIEVED THEM. THAT'S WHY THEY HAD WELCOMED THEM WITH OPEN ARMS, AND EVEN AFTER THAT SPEECH WAS OVER. Man: MY HEART IS GLADDER THAN IT EVER WAS BEFORE TO SEE A WHITE MAN. IF YOU WANT TO OPEN THE ROAD, NO ONE CAN PREVENT IT. IT WILL ALWAYS BE OPEN TO YOU. WHEN YOU RETURN, IF I AM LIVING, YOU WILL SEE ME AGAIN, THE SAME MAN. WE SHALL LOOK AT THE RIVER WITH IMPATIENCE FOR YOUR RETURN. KAKAWISSASSA, LIGHTNING CROW. Narrator: ACCORDING TO THE YANKTON SIOUX, DURING THE EXPEDITION'S VISIT, A CHILD WAS BORN. LEWIS WRAPPED THE BABY BOY IN A UNITED STATES FLAG AND DECLARED HIM AN AMERICAN. BUT A CHIEF ALSO ISSUED A WARNING. "THE NEXT TRIBE UP THE MISSOURI," HE TOLD THE CAPTAINS, "WILL NOT OPEN THEIR EARS, AND YOU CANNOT, I FEAR, OPEN THEM." THEY WERE THE TETON SIOUX, ALSO KNOWN AS THE LAKOTA, AND THEIR REPUTATION HAD ALREADY REACHED WASHINGTON. Thomas Jefferson: YOU WILL PROBABLY MEET WITH PARTIES OF THE TETON SIOUX. ON THAT NATION, WE WISH MOST PARTICULARLY TO MAKE A FRIENDLY IMPRESSION BECAUSE OF THEIR IMMENSE POWER. Narrator: THE LAKOTA HAD ONLY RECENTLY MIGRATED WEST ONTO THE GREAT PLAINS, BUT THEY WERE NOW THE MOST POWERFUL FORCE IN THE REGION, DOMINATING EVERY OTHER TRIBE AROUND THEM. FOR YEARS, THEY HAD INTIMIDATED FRENCH AND SPANISH BOATMEN, STOPPED SOME FROM CONTINUING UPRIVER, DEMANDED TRIBUTE FROM OTHERS, EVEN CONFISCATED CANOES AND ALL THEIR CARGO, UTTERLY CONTROLLING THE FLOW OF TRADE GOODS ALONG THE MISSOURI. ON THE MORNING OF SEPTEMBER 25, NEAR WHAT IS NOW PIERRE, SOUTH DAKOTA, THE CORPS OF DISCOVERY MET THE TETON SIOUX. WHILE LARGE NUMBERS OF LAKOTAS GATHERED ON BOTH SIDES OF THE RIVER, CHIEFS NAMED BLACK BUFFALO, THE PARTISAN, AND BUFFALO MEDICINE, ALONG WITH 30 WARRIORS, CAME OVER TO TALK. EVEN WILLIAM CLARK, WHO HAD BEEN IN SCRAPES WITH INDIANS BEFORE, SEEMED ANXIOUS. John Ordway: GAVE THE 3 CHIEFS 3 NEW MEDALS AND ONE AMERICAN FLAG, SOME KNIVES, AND OTHER SMALL ARTICLES OF GOODS. THEY DID NOT APPEAR TO TALK MUCH UNTIL THEY HAD GOT THE GOODS, AND THEN THEY WANTED MORE AND SAID WE MUST STOP WITH THEM OR LEAVE ONE OF THE CANOES WITH THEM, AS THAT WAS WHAT THEY EXPECTED. JOHN ORDWAY. Ambrose: THE TETON SIOUX TRIED TO FORCE A TOLL THAT WAS BEYOND THE EXPEDITION'S ABILITY TO PAY, AND WHEN THE EXPEDITION WOULDN'T PAY IT-- NOT ENOUGH TOBACCO, NOT ENOUGH WHISKEY, NOT ENOUGH BEADS, NOT ENOUGH GUNS-- WHICH WAS PRINCIPALLY WHAT THEY WANTED-- THEY MADE AN ATTEMPT TO STOP THE EXPEDITION. Narrator: WHEN CLARK BROUGHT THE CHIEFS BACK TO SHORE AFTER SHOWING THEM THE KEELBOAT, 3 WARRIORS SEIZED HIS CANOE'S TOWROPE. THE PARTISAN BEGAN ARGUING WITH CLARK, WHO DREW HIS SWORD. ALONG THE BANK, LAKOTA WARRIORS NOTCHED THEIR ARROWS. ON BOARD THE KEELBOAT, LEWIS LOADED THE CANNON. THE FATE OF THE ENTIRE EXPEDITION HUNG IN THE BALANCE. John Ordway: CAPTAIN CLARK TOLD THEM THAT WE MUST AND WOULD GO ON, THAT WE WERE NOT SQUAWS, BUT WARRIORS. THE CHIEF SAID HE HAD WARRIORS, TOO, AND IF WE WERE TO GO ON, THEY WOULD FOLLOW US AND KILL AND TAKE THE WHOLE OF US BY DEGREES. Ambrose: THIS WAS THE TENSEST MOMENT BECAUSE YOU HAD HUNDREDS OF INDIANS ON THE RIVERBANK WITH THEIR BOWS STRUNG AND CLARK WITH HIS SWORD DRAWN, READY TO DRIVE IT THROUGH THE HEART OF THE TETON SIOUX CHIEFS. IF THEY DIDN'T LET GO OF THE CORD OF THAT CANOE THAT THEY WERE TRYING TO HOLD ON TO TO FORCE THIS PAYMENT, CLARK WAS READY TO ACT. "I FELT MYSELF GROW WARM," HE WROTE IN HIS JOURNAL. Narrator: AT THAT MOMENT, BLACK BUFFALO INTERVENED AND DIPLOMATICALLY CHANGED THE SUBJECT. HIS ONLY REQUEST, HE SAID, WAS THAT THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN OF HIS VILLAGE ALSO BE ALLOWED TO COME AND SEE THE KEELBOAT AND MEET THE EXPLORERS BEFORE THEY MOVED ON. CLARK QUICKLY AGREED, AND FOR 3 MORE DAYS, THE EXPEDITION NERVOUSLY STAYED AMONG THE LAKOTA. Joseph Whitehouse: THEY APPEAR TO BE THE MOST FRIENDLY PEOPLE I EVER SAW, BUT THEY WILL STEAL AND PLUNDER IF THEY CAN GET AN OPPORTUNITY. ABOUT 15 DAYS AGO, THEY HAD A BATTLE WITH THE OMAHAS. THEY KILLED 65 MEN AND TOOK 25 WOMEN PRISONERS. THEY TOOK THE 65 OMAHA SCALPS AND HAD THEM HUNG ON SMALL POLES, WHICH THEIR WOMEN HELD IN THEIR HANDS WHEN THEY DANCED. THEY HAD DRUMS AND WHISTLES FOR MUSIC. THEY KEPT IT UP UNTIL 1:00, DANCING WAR DANCES AROUND THE FIRE, WHICH WAS CURIOUS TO US. JOSEPH WHITEHOUSE. Narrator: BY THE TIME THE EXPEDITION MOVED ON, CLARK HAD FORMED AN OPINION OF THE LAKOTAS DIFFERENT FROM HIS ATTITUDE TOWARD ALL OTHER INDIANS. William Clark: THESE ARE THE VILEST MISCREANTS OF A SAVAGE RACE. THEY MUST EVER REMAIN THE PIRATES OF THE MISSOURI UNTIL SUCH MEASURES ARE PURSUED BY OUR GOVERNMENT AS WILL MAKE THEM FEEL A DEPENDENCE ON ITS WILL FOR THEIR SUPPLY OF MERCHANDISE. WILLIAM CLARK. Narrator: AS THE EXPLORERS PUSHED NORTH INTO WHAT IS NOW NORTH DAKOTA, HUGE FLOCKS OF GEESE AND OTHER BIRDS PASSED OVERHEAD, MIGRATING SOUTH. IT WAS OCTOBER NOW. THE WEATHER WAS TURNING COLDER. THERE WERE FROSTS AT NIGHT, EVEN AN OCCASIONAL FLURRY OF SNOW. CLARK WAS SEIZED BY RHEUMATISM, WHICH LEWIS TREATED BY APPLYING A HOT STONE WRAPPED IN FLANNEL. WHEN THEY HAD LEFT ST. LOUIS, THE CAPTAINS HAD HOPED TO REACH THE HEADWATERS OF THE MISSOURI BEFORE STOPPING FOR THE WINTER. NOW THAT WAS CLEARLY OUT OF THE QUESTION. BY LATE OCTOBER, ACCORDING TO CLARK'S ESTIMATES, THEY HAD TRAVELED 1,600 MILES UP THE BIG RIVER, BUT THEY WERE NOWHERE NEAR ITS SOURCE OR THE NORTHWEST PASSAGE THEY BELIEVED WOULD LEAD THEM TO THE SEA. INSTEAD, AFTER 6 MONTHS OF HARD TRAVEL, THEY WERE ARRIVING AT THE LAST FIXED POINT ON THEIR MAP OF THE RIVER, BEYOND WHICH EVERYTHING WAS ONLY RUMOR AND CONJECTURE. HERE THE CAPTAINS REALIZED THEY WOULD HAVE TO FIND A SAFE PLACE IN THE VASTNESS OF THE NORTHERN PLAINS TO SURVIVE THE WINTER. Woman: WHEN YOU WHITE PEOPLE MET OUR MANDAN PEOPLE, WE GAVE TO THE WHITES THE NAME MACI, MEANING NICE PEOPLE OR PRETTY PEOPLE. WE SAID ALSO, WE WILL CALL THESE PEOPLE OUR FRIENDS. Narrator: FOR CENTURIES, THE MANDANS OF THE UPPER MISSOURI HAD BEEN ONE OF THE DOMINANT TRIBES ON THE GREAT PLAINS, PROSPEROUS FARMERS WHO LIVED WITH THEIR NEIGHBORS, THE HIDATSAS, IN 5 LARGE VILLAGES OF EARTH LODGES, HOME TO 4,500 PEOPLE, MORE THAN LIVED IN ST. LOUIS OR WASHINGTON, D.C. EACH YEAR, DELEGATIONS OF CROWS, ASSINIBOINES, CHEYENNES, AND CREES CAME GREAT DISTANCES TO TRADE WITH THEM. EUROPEANS HAD COME, TOO-- REPRESENTATIVES OF FRANCE, SPAIN, AND ENGLAND, EACH COUNTRY RACING TO FIND THE NORTHWEST PASSAGE AND THE GREAT WEALTH IT WOULD ADD TO THEIR EMPIRES. ON OCTOBER 24, 1804, NEAR WHAT IS NOW BISMARCK, NORTH DAKOTA, THE MANDANS LOOKED DOWN FROM THE BLUFFS OF THE MISSOURI AND SAW THE LATEST GROUP OF WHITE MEN TO ARRIVE AT THEIR VILLAGE. IT WAS THE CORPS OF DISCOVERY. THE MANDANS WELCOMED THE STRANGERS, LISTENED TO THEIR SPEECHES, ACCEPTED THEIR GIFTS, AND INVITED THEM TO BUILD A FORT RIGHT ACROSS THE RIVER. Man: OUR WISH IS TO BE AT PEACE WITH ALL. IF WE EAT, YOU SHALL EAT. IF WE STARVE, YOU MUST STARVE, ALSO. SHEHEKE, BIG WHITE. Meriwether Lewis: FORT MANDAN, 1,609 MILES ABOVE THE ENTRANCE OF THE MISSOURI. DEAR MOTHER... THE NEAR APPROACH OF WINTER, THE LOW STATE OF THE WATER, AND THE KNOWN SCARCITY OF TIMBER WHICH EXISTS ON THE MISSOURI FOR MANY HUNDREDS OF MILES DETERMINED MY FRIEND AND COMPANION CAPTAIN CLARK AND MYSELF TO FORTIFY OURSELVES AND REMAIN FOR THE WINTER IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE MANDANS, WHO ARE THE MOST FRIENDLY AND WELL-DISPOSED SAVAGES THAT WE HAVE YET MET WITH. GIVE YOURSELF NO UNEASINESS WITH RESPECT TO MY FATE, FOR I ASSURE YOU THAT I FEEL MYSELF PERFECTLY SAFE, AND THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 3,000 OR 4,000 MILES AND 130 IS THAT I CANNOT HAVE THE PLEASURE OF SEEING YOU AS OFTEN AS I DID WHILE AT WASHINGTON. MERIWETHER LEWIS. Narrator: WINTER CAME EARLY THAT YEAR ON THE NORTHERN PLAINS. BY NOVEMBER 13, ICE WAS RUNNING IN THE RIVER. THE WATER IN SOME COTTONWOODS EXPANDED AS IT FROZE, SHATTERING THE TREES WITH A SOUND LIKE CANNON FIRE. THE WIND NEVER SEEMED TO STOP. THE TEMPERATURE KEPT DROPPING, "COLDER," WROTE SERGEANT JOHN ORDWAY, "THAN I EVER KNEW IT TO BE IN THE STATES." Patrick Gass: DECEMBER 6, 1804. IN THE NIGHT, THE RIVER FROZE OVER AND IN THE MORNING WAS COVERED WITH SOLID ICE 1 1/2" THICK. PATRICK GASS. William Clark: DECEMBER 12-- A CLEAR, COLD MORNING. THE THERMOMETER AT SUNRISE STOOD AT 38 DEGREES BELOW ZERO. THE WEATHER IS SO COLD THAT WE DO NOT THINK IT PRUDENT TO TURN OUT TO HUNT, AT LEAST UNTIL OUR CONSTITUTIONS ARE PREPARED TO UNDERGO THIS CLIMATE. DECEMBER 17, A VERY COLD MORNING-- 45 DEGREES BELOW ZERO. WILLIAM CLARK. Narrator: THAT WINTER, THE MANDANS CROSSED THE FROZEN RIVER OFTEN. THEY BROUGHT CORN, BEANS, AND BUFFALO ROBES IN EXCHANGE FOR REPAIRS ON THEIR KNIVES AND KETTLES THAT ALEXANDER WILLARD, A FORMER BLACKSMITH, MADE ON A FORGE THE EXPEDITION HAD BROUGHT ALONG. Duncan: YOU'RE NOT SURE WHO'S EXPLORING WHO SOMETIMES. LEWIS AND CLARK ARE WRITING DOWN THE CUSTOMS OF THE MANDANS. THE MANDANS ARE COMING OVER TO SEE, "HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON IN THIS FORT?" THERE WAS A ONE-EYED BOATMAN NAMED PIERRE CRUZATTE WHO PLAYED THE FIDDLE, AND EVERYONE ENJOYED THAT, AND TO WATCH THE AMERICANS DANCE FOR THEM, AND THEN THE AMERICANS WOULD WATCH THE MANDANS DO A DANCE FOR THEM. IT WAS A COLD, COLD WINTER, BUT IT WAS MADE A LOT WARMER JUST BY THE FRIENDSHIP OF THE DIFFERENT CULTURES. William Clark: THOSE INDIANS WERE MUCH ASTONISHED AT MY SERVANT. THEY NEVER SAW A BLACK MAN BEFORE. ALL FLOCKED AROUND HIM AND EXAMINED HIM FROM TOP TO TOE. Narrator: TO THE AMERICANS, YORK WAS A SLAVE. TO THE INDIANS, HE WAS BIG MEDICINE. Baker: AND I REMEMBER MY FATHER TELLING ME ABOUT THIS STORY, TAKING DIRT AND TRY TO GO UP TO HIM AND RUB THAT BLACK OFF, AND WHEN THEY FOUND OUT THEY COULDN'T RUB IT OFF, THAT HE WAS A MAN-- OF COURSE, HE WAS VERY MUSCULAR AND HE WAS A BIG MAN, APPARENTLY. AND SO THEY HAD A LOT OF RESPECT FOR THAT, AND HE WAS FOLLOWED AROUND ALL THE TIME BY THE CHILDREN AND BY THE WOMEN BECAUSE HE WAS POWERFUL, AND PEOPLE RESPECTED THAT. AND HE WAS DIFFERENT. HE WAS DIFFERENT. INDIAN WAY TEACHES US THAT JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE DIFFERENT DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT'S WRONG. Narrator: IN EARLY JANUARY OF 1805, WITH THE SUPPLY OF MEAT RUNNING LOW, THE MANDANS INVITED THE EXPEDITION TO PARTICIPATE IN A SPECIAL CEREMONY. IT WAS A SACRED RITUAL MEANT TO CALL THE BUFFALO HERDS BACK TO THE VICINITY OF THE VILLAGE. William Clark: JANUARY 5, 1805-- A BUFFALO DANCE FOR 3 NIGHTS PAST IN THE FIRST VILLAGE. A CURIOUS CUSTOM. THE OLD MEN ARRANGE THEMSELVES IN A CIRCLE, AND THE YOUNG MEN GO TO ONE OF THE OLD MEN WITH A WHINING TONE AND REQUEST THE OLD MAN TO TAKE HIS WIFE, WHO PRESENTS HERSELF NAKED EXCEPT A ROBE, AND SLEEP WITH HER. ALL THIS IS TO CAUSE THE BUFFALO TO COME NEAR SO THAT THEY MAY KILL THEM. WE SENT A MAN TO THIS MEDICINE DANCE LAST NIGHT. THEY GAVE HIM 4 GIRLS. WILLIAM CLARK. Narrator: TWO DAYS LATER, THE BUFFALO SHOWED UP. Patrick Gass: CAPTAIN LEWIS AND 11 MORE OF US WENT OUT AND SAW THE PRAIRIE COVERED WITH BUFFALO AND THE INDIANS ON HORSEBACK, KILLING THEM. THEY KILLED 30 OR 40, AND WE KILLED 11 OF THEM. THEY SHOOT THEM WITH BOWS AND ARROWS AND HAVE THEIR HORSES TRAINED THAT THEY WILL ADVANCE VERY NEAR AND SUDDENLY WHEEL AND FLY OFF IN CASE THE WOUNDED BUFFALO ATTEMPT AN ATTACK. SERGEANT PATRICK GASS. Narrator: THROUGHOUT THE WINTER, MERIWETHER LEWIS' PRIMITIVE MEDICAL SKILLS WERE CONTINUALLY PRESSED INTO SERVICE. HE HAD TO AMPUTATE THE FROZEN TOES OF AN INDIAN BOY WITHOUT ANESTHESIA OR A SURGICAL SAW. BY LATE JANUARY, MANY OF THE MEN SHOWED SIGNS OF VENEREAL DISEASE, WHICH LEWIS TREATED WITH A SALVE OF MERCURY. AND ON THE BITTERLY COLD EVENING OF FEBRUARY 11, LEWIS MADE A MOST UNUSUAL HOUSECALL. A BABY WAS BEING BORN, AND THE YOUNG MOTHER WAS HAVING TROUBLE WITH THE DELIVERY. HER NAME WAS SACAGAWEA-- A SHOSHONE GIRL WHO HAD BEEN CAPTURED SEVERAL YEARS EARLIER BY THE HIDATSAS AND THEN SOLD TO TOUSSAINT CHARBONNEAU, A FRENCH CANADIAN FUR TRADER. LEARNING THAT THE SHOSHONES LIVED NEAR THE HEADWATERS OF THE MISSOURI AND THINKING THEY MIGHT NEED A GOOD INTERPRETER WHEN THEY REACHED IT, THE CAPTAINS HAD HIRED SACAGAWEA'S HUSBAND, KNOWING SHE WOULD COME WITH HIM. Duncan: SHE'S CALLED A LOT OF DIFFERENT NAMES-- SACAKAWEA, SACAGAWEA, SACAGAWEA, BIRD WOMAN. SHE'S A TEENAGER. SHE'S ABOUT 16 YEARS OLD. SHE'S ONE OF TWO WIVES OF TOUSSAINT CHARBONNEAU. SHE'S PREGNANT WHEN THEY HIRE HER. UM, BUT THEY KNEW THAT SHE WOULD BE ESSENTIAL, AND SHE BECAME ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT MEMBERS OF THE EXPEDITION. Narrator: BUT NOW, SHE WAS IN LABOR. IT WAS EXCRUCIATINGLY SLOW, LEWIS NOTED, AND THE PAIN VIOLENT. SOMEONE SUGGESTED THAT THE RINGS OF A RATTLESNAKE CRUSHED INTO POWDER AND GIVEN WITH WATER SOMETIMES HELPED EASE AND SPEED A BABY'S DELIVERY. LEWIS GOT SOME FROM HIS COLLECTION OF ANIMAL SKINS AND PLANTS. SACAGAWEA WAS GIVEN THE RATTLESNAKE POTION. [BABY CRYING] Meriwether Lewis: WHETHER THIS MEDICINE WAS TRULY THE CAUSE OR NOT I SHALL NOT UNDERTAKE TO DETERMINE, BUT SHE HAD NOT TAKEN IT MORE THAN 10 MINUTES BEFORE SHE BROUGHT FORTH. Narrator: IT WAS A BOY, WHOM CHARBONNEAU NAMED JEAN-BAPTISTE. AND THE CAPTAINS AGREED THAT WHEN SPRING FINALLY CAME, HE COULD GO WEST WITH THEM AS THE YOUNGEST MEMBER OF THE CORPS OF DISCOVERY. Thomas Jefferson: I KNOW THAT THE ACQUISITION OF LOUISIANA HAS BEEN DISAPPROVED BY SOME FROM A CANDID APPREHENSION THAT THE ENLARGEMENT OF OUR TERRITORY WOULD ENDANGER ITS UNION. BUT IS IT NOT BETTER THAT THE OPPOSITE BANK OF THE MISSISSIPPI SHOULD BE SETTLED BY OUR BRETHREN AND CHILDREN THAN BY STRANGERS FROM ANOTHER FAMILY? THOMAS JEFFERSON. Narrator: IN THE EAST, PRESIDENT JEFFERSON HAD BEEN RE-ELECTED TO A SECOND TERM, BUT HIS DECISION TO PURCHASE THE LOUISIANA TERRITORY STILL HAD MANY ENEMIES. FAR AWAY, IN MEXICO CITY, NERVOUS SPANISH AUTHORITIES FEARED THAT THE REAL MISSION OF THE EXPEDITION WAS TO PREPARE THE UNITED STATES TO CONQUER TEXAS, THE SOUTHWEST, PERHAPS MEXICO ITSELF. UNBEKNOWNST TO JEFFERSON AND THE CAPTAINS, SPAIN HAD ALREADY SENT A DETACHMENT OF SOLDIERS AND COMANCHE INDIANS NORTH TO INTERCEPT THE EXPEDITION. THEY FAILED, REACHING THE PLATTE RIVER JUST A MONTH AFTER LEWIS AND CLARK HAD PASSED. NOW THE VICEROYS IN MEXICO CITY WERE PLANNING ANOTHER ATTEMPT TO CATCH THE EXPLORERS ON THE RETURN TRIP. IN MID-FEBRUARY, GEORGE DROUILLARD RETURNED FROM A HUNTING EXPEDITION TO SAY THAT A BAND OF LAKOTAS HAD STOLEN TWO HORSES. THE LAKOTAS BRAGGED ABOUT IT TO A FRENCH FUR TRADER, WHO REPORTED BACK TO THE CORPS OF DISCOVERY. John Ordway: MR. TABO SAID TO KEEP A GOOD LOOKOUT, FOR HE HEARD THE SIOUX SAY THAT THEY SHOULD SURELY COME TO WAR IN THE SPRING AGAINST US AND THE MANDANS. THEY SAY IF THEY CAN CATCH ANY MORE OF US, THEY WILL KILL US, FOR THEY THINK THAT WE ARE BAD MEDICINE. JOHN ORDWAY. Narrator: BUT LEWIS AND CLARK WERE ALREADY PLANNING TO BE MUCH FARTHER WEST BY THE TIME THE LAKOTAS RETURNED. AS THE LONG WINTER SLOWLY ENDED, THEY ASKED THEIR INDIAN FRIENDS WHAT LAY AHEAD. THE CHIEFS DREW LINES ON THE DIRT FLOORS OF THEIR LODGES, WHILE CLARK TRANSFERRED THE INFORMATION ONTO A MAP HE WAS PREPARING FOR JEFFERSON. THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS WATERFALL FARTHER UPRIVER, ONE CHIEF TOLD THEM, AND THEN THEY WOULD HAVE TO PASS THROUGH A RANGE OF SHINING MOUNTAINS. THE CAPTAINS CALCULATED THAT THE PORTAGE AROUND THE FALLS WOULD TAKE ONLY HALF A DAY, AND THE MOUNTAINS, THEY WERE SURE, WERE LIKE THE ONES THEY KNEW IN VIRGINIA-- 2 OR 3 DAYS AT MOST TO CROSS. THEY TOLD THE CHIEFS THEY COULD MAKE IT TO THE PACIFIC AND BACK TO THE MANDAN VILLAGES BEFORE WINTER CAME AGAIN. BY EARLY APRIL, THE ICE WAS OUT OF THE RIVER. LEWIS AND CLARK SENT A DOZEN MEN BACK TO ST. LOUIS WITH A BIG KEELBOAT LOADED WITH MATERIALS FOR JEFFERSON-- LENGTHY REPORTS ABOUT INDIAN TRIBES, BOX AFTER BOX OF SPECIMENS, AND 5 LIVE ANIMALS, INCLUDING THE PRAIRIE DOG THEY HAD FLOODED FROM ITS HOME. WITH THE SHIPMENT WENT A LETTER FROM LEWIS SPEAKING FOR ALL OF THOSE WHO WERE ABOUT TO LEAVE FORT MANDAN FOR THE UNKNOWN. THE CORPS OF DISCOVERY WAS NO LONGER THE UNDISCIPLINED COLLECTION OF FRONTIERSMEN WHO HAD LEFT ST. LOUIS A YEAR EARLIER. Meriwether Lewis: AT THIS MOMENT, EVERY INDIVIDUAL OF THE PARTY ARE IN GOOD HEALTH AND EXCELLENT SPIRITS, ZEALOUSLY ATTACHED TO THE ENTERPRISE AND ANXIOUS TO PROCEED. NOT A WHISPER OF DISCONTENT OR MURMUR IS TO BE HEARD AMONG THEM, BUT ALL IN UNISON ACT WITH THE MOST PERFECT HARMONY. WITH SUCH MEN, I HAVE BUT LITTLE TO FEAR AND EVERYTHING TO HOPE. Duncan: THEY'RE GOING TO LEAVE FORT MANDAN AS A COHESIVE TEAM. THEY'VE SPENT A LONG YEAR GOING UP THE RIVER TOGETHER, AND THEY'VE SPENT A REALLY HARD WINTER TOGETHER IN NORTH DAKOTA. SO NOW THEY'RE GOING TO WORK AS A TEAM, AND THEY'RE GOING TO NEED IT BECAUSE THEY'RE LEAVING WHERE THE MAP IS AND THEY'RE ABOUT TO GO INTO THE REAL UNKNOWN. Meriwether Lewis: WE WERE NOW ABOUT TO PENETRATE A COUNTRY AT LEAST 2,000 MILES IN WIDTH ON WHICH THE FOOT OF CIVILIZED MAN HAD NEVER TRODDEN. THE GOOD OR EVIL IT HAD IN STORE FOR US WAS FOR EXPERIMENT YET TO DETERMINE. YET ENTERTAINING AS I DO THE MOST CONFIDENT HOPE OF SUCCEEDING IN A VOYAGE WHICH HAD FORMED A PROJECT OF MINE FOR THE LAST 10 YEARS, I COULD BUT ESTEEM THIS MOMENT OF MY DEPARTURE AS AMONG THE MOST HAPPY OF MY LIFE. MERIWETHER LEWIS. Narrator: ON APRIL 7, 1805, THE CORPS OF DISCOVERY HEADED WEST ONCE MORE. TRAVELING IN 6 DUGOUTS AND 2 LARGER CANOES, THEY PUSHED INTO WHAT IS NOW MONTANA, FARTHER WEST THAN ANY WHITE MAN HAD GONE BEFORE ON THE RIVER. FIERCE HEADWINDS SLOWED THEIR PROGRESS, SOMETIMES STOPPED THEM FOR ENTIRE DAYS. SAND BLEW IN THEIR FACES AND SCRATCHED THEIR EYES-- "SO PENETRATING," LEWIS WROTE, "WE ARE COMPELLED TO EAT, DRINK, AND BREATHE IT." THERE WERE JUST 33 MEMBERS OF THE PARTY NOW, INCLUDING THE YOUNG SHOSHONE WOMAN SACAGAWEA. SHE DUG FOR PRAIRIE TURNIPS AND ARTICHOKES, PICKED WILD LICORICE AND BERRIES FOR THE CAPTAINS' DINNERS. AND WITH HER WAS HER INFANT SON JEAN-BAPTISTE, WHOM THE MEN CALLED "LITTLE POMP." Ambrose: AND SHE BROUGHT A WOMAN'S TOUCH TO THIS EXPEDITION. I LIKE TO THINK THAT AS SHE WAS NURSING POMP AT NIGHT AROUND THE CAMPFIRE, THAT SCENE HAD TO HAVE HAD A GREAT EFFECT ON THE MEN. TO HEAR A WOMAN'S LAUGH AT NIGHT AROUND THE CAMPFIRE BOLSTERED SPIRITS. Funkhouser: WELL, I THINK IT'S A DIFFERENT JOURNEY FOR EVERYBODY WHO'S MAKING IT, AND IT'S CERTAINLY A DIFFERENT JOURNEY FOR SACAGAWEA. SHE, UNLIKE ANYONE ELSE IN THE CORPS OF DISCOVERY, IS MAKING A RETURN VOYAGE. SHE'S GOING BACK HOME. SHE WAS ALSO TENDING TO THIS INFANT AND CARRYING IT ALMOST THE ENTIRE EXPEDITION ON HER BACK, AS FAR AS WE KNOW. THOUSANDS OF MILES WITH A BABY... WITH A BABY. Narrator: ONE BLUSTERY DAY, SACAGAWEA'S HUSBAND CHARBONNEAU LOST CONTROL OF HIS BOAT. THE EXPEDITION'S SCIENTIFIC EQUIPMENT, BOOKS, AND MEDICINES BEGAN TO WASH OVERBOARD. CHARBONNEAU PANICKED, BUT SACAGAWEA REMAINED CALM AND SOMEHOW MANAGED TO RESCUE EVERYTHING, INCLUDING THE JOURNALS OF LEWIS AND CLARK. CHARBONNEAU, LEWIS WROTE LATER, WAS A MAN OF NO PARTICULAR MERIT, BUT SACAGAWEA, HE SAID, WAS AS BRAVE AS ANYONE ON THE EXPEDITION. Meriwether Lewis: ABOUT 5 MILES ABOVE THE MOUTH OF THE MUSSELSHELL RIVER, A HANDSOME RIVER OF ABOUT 50 YARDS IN WIDTH DISCHARGED ITSELF. THIS STREAM WE CALLED SACAGAWEA OR BIRD WOMAN'S RIVER, AFTER OUR INTERPRETER, THE SHOSHONE WOMAN. Narrator: WITH EACH MILE IT TRAVELED NOW, THE CORPS OF DISCOVERY WAS MAPPING NEW TERRITORY. THE CAPTAINS STRUGGLED TO THINK OF NAMES FOR EVERY LANDMARK THEY ENCOUNTERED-- BRATTON'S, WISER'S, WINDSOR'S, AND THOMSON'S CREEK FOR MEN IN THE EXPEDITION, UNTIL THE NAME OF EVERY MEMBER OF THE CORPS OF DISCOVERY WAS AFFIXED TO THE LAND. ON MAY 29, THEY SAW ANOTHER RIVER, WHOSE WATERS SEEMED MUCH CLEARER THAN THE OTHERS THEY HAD SEEN. CLARK CONSIDERED IT AN ESPECIALLY PRETTY STREAM AND NAMED IT THE JUDITH RIVER IN HONOR OF A YOUNG GIRL BACK IN VIRGINIA HE HOPED ONE DAY WOULD BE HIS WIFE. [BEAR GROWLING] DURING THE WINTER IN NORTH DAKOTA, THE HIDATSAS HAD TOLD LEWIS AND CLARK ABOUT THIS FEROCIOUS ANIMAL THAT LIVES WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO BE GOING. IT'S A BIG BEAR, A BEAR THE SIZE THAT YOU'VE NEVER SEEN. WELL, AS THEY'RE GOING WEST INTO MONTANA, THEY START SEEING SOME BIG BEAR TRACKS. THEY THINK, "HEY, THIS MUST BE IT." BUT THEY'RE MORE CURIOUS THAN FRIGHTENED OF IT. [BEAR ROARING] Narrator: IT WAS THE GRIZZLY. AFTER PASSING THE MOUTH OF THE YELLOWSTONE RIVER, LEWIS AND ANOTHER HUNTER SHOT THEIR FIRST ONE. Ambrose: AND LEWIS REMARKED IN HIS JOURNAL THAT "I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THE INDIANS ARE AFRAID "OF THESE BEARS, WITH THEIR INDIFFERENT LITTLE MUSKETS "THAT THE BRITISH SELL TO THEM AND THEIR BOWS AND ARROWS, BUT WE GOT KENTUCKY LONG RIFLES. WE CAN TAKE ON ANYTHING." AFTER ABOUT THE THIRD BEAR, THE RESOLUTION OF THE MEN BEGAN TO CRUMBLE A BIT BECAUSE THESE GENTLEMEN WERE SO HARD TO KILL. THEY'D HIT THESE BEARS WITH 8, 10, 12 SLUGS-- SOME OF THEM THROUGH THE BRAINS, OTHERS THROUGH THE LUNGS, SOMETIMES THROUGH THE HEART-- AND THESE BEARS WERE STILL COMING AFTER THEM. [BEAR GROWLING] [GUNSHOT] Duncan: IT CHASES THEM OFF THE PLAIN AND INTO THE RIVER. THEY MEET ANOTHER ONE WHO CHASES SOME MEN UP A TREE. EVERYWHERE THEY'RE GOING, THEY'RE MEETIN THESE BIG GRIZZLY BEARS THAT THEY JUST HAVE TROUBLE KILLING. AND FINALLY LEWIS SITS DOWN ONE NIGHT TO WRITE IN HIS JOURNAL. HE SAYS, "I FIND THE CURIOSITY OF OUR MEN WITH RESPECT TO THIS ANIMAL IS PRETTY MUCH SATISFIED." Meriwether Lewis: MAY 30. MANY CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE OUR NEAR APPROACH TO A COUNTRY WHOSE CLIMATE DIFFERS CONSIDERABLY FROM THAT IN WHICH WE HAVE BEEN FOR MANY MONTHS. Narrator: LEWIS NOTED IN HIS JOURNAL THAT THE AIR WAS MUCH DRIER. THE INK IN HIS INKSTAND EVAPORATED MORE QUICKLY. A WOODEN CASE SHRANK AT THE JOINTS FROM THE LACK OF HUMIDITY. John Ordway: THIS COUNTRY MAY WITH PROPRIETY BE CALLED THE DESERTS OF NORTH AMERICA, FOR I DO NOT CONCEIVE ANY PART OF IT CAN EVER BE SETTLED, AS IT IS DEFICIENT OF WATER EXCEPT IN THIS RIVER AND DEFICIENT OF TIMBER AND TOO STEEP TO BE TILLED. JOHN ORDWAY. Ambrose: LEWIS WRITES AT ONE POINT THAT "IF THIS RIVER WEREN'T GROWING A LITTLE SHALLOWER EVERY DAY, I WOULD SUSPECT THAT IT WOULD NEVER HAVE AN END." MOUNTAINS WERE FINALLY SEEN IN THE END OF MAY OF 1805, BUT THEY WERE SO FAR IN THE DISTANCE, AND IT JUST SEEMED YOU WOULD NEVER, EVER BE ABLE TO GET TO THEM. MEANWHILE, YOU'RE STRUGGLING ALONG, KNOWING THESE MOUNTAINS ARE HUNDREDS OF MILES OUT THERE, AND YOU'RE MAKING 10, 12 MILES A DAY. IT'S ALWAYS SEEMED TO ME THAT THEY MUST HAVE BEEN, EVERY TIME THEY LOOKED UP FROM THAT RIVER, WONDERING, "MY GOD ALMIGHTY. WILL WE EVER MAKE IT? WILL THIS RIVER EVER HAVE AN END TO IT?" Narrator: NOW THEY ENTERED A NEW SECTION OF THE MISSOURI. THE INDIANS HAD NOT TOLD THEM ABOUT IT, AND THEY WERE UNPREPARED FOR ITS WILD BEAUTY. Meriwether Lewis: THE HILLS AND RIVER CLIFFS WHICH WE PASSED TODAY EXHIBIT A MOST ROMANTIC APPEARANCE. THE BLUFFS OF THE RIVER RISE TO THE HEIGHT OF FROM 200 TO 300 FEET AND, IN MOST PLACES, NEARLY PERPENDICULAR. THEY ARE FORMED OF REMARKABLE WHITE SANDSTONE. NICHES AND ALCOVES OF VARIOUS FORMS AND SIZES ARE SEEN AT DIFFERENT HEIGHTS AS WE PASS. THE TOPS OF THE COLUMNS DID NOT THE LESS REMIND US OF SOME OF THOSE LARGE, STONE BUILDINGS IN THE UNITED STATES. Patrick Gass: WE PASSED SOME VERY CURIOUS CLIFFS AND ROCKY PEAKS IN A LONG RANGE, SOME OF THEM 200 FEET HIGH AND NOT MORE THAN 8 FEET THICK. THEY SEEM AS IF BUILT BY THE HAND OF MAN AND ARE SO NUMEROUS THAT THEY APPEAR LIKE THE RUINS OF AN ANCIENT CITY. Meriwether Lewis: AS WE PASSED ON, IT SEEMED AS IF THOSE SCENES OF VISIONARY ENCHANTMENT WOULD NEVER HAVE AN END. MERIWETHER LEWIS. Narrator: BUT NOW AN UNEXPECTED CHALLENGE SUDDENLY FACED THEM. Man: JUNE 2. WE CAMPED AT A FORK OF THE RIVER. WE COULD NOT DETERMINE WHICH ONE WAS THE MISSOURI. OUR OFFICERS AND ALL THE MEN DIFFER IN THEIR OPINIONS OF WHICH RIVER TO TAKE. Narrator: THE INDIANS HAD NOT MENTIONED SUCH A FORK. THE NORTHERN BRANCH WAS MUDDY, JUST AS THE RIVER HAD BEEN ALL THE WAY FROM ST. LOUIS, AND MOST OF THE MEN BELIEVED IT WAS THEREFORE THE TRUE MISSOURI. LEWIS AND CLARK THOUGHT OTHERWISE-- THAT THE MISSOURI SHOULD BE GETTING SWIFTER AND CLEARER, LIKE A MOUNTAIN RIVER, IF IT WAS TO LEAD THEM TO THE NORTHWEST PASSAGE. THEY WANTED TO FOLLOW THE SOUTHERN BRANCH. Meriwether Lewis: TO ASCEND THE WRONG STREAM WOULD NOT ONLY LOSE US THE WHOLE OF THIS SEASON, BUT WOULD PROBABLY SO DISHEARTEN THE PARTY THAT IT MIGHT DEFEAT THE EXPEDITION ALTOGETHER. Duncan: RATHER THAN JUST SAYING, "WE SAY IT'S THIS WAY. WE'RE GOING THIS WAY," WHICH THEY COULD DO AS MILITARY COMMANDERS, THEY SAID, "WE'LL STOP. WE'LL RECONNOITER. WE'LL CHECK UP THIS RIVER. WE'LL CHECK UP THAT RIVER" BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO BRING THESE PEOPLE ALONG WITH THEM. THEY'RE WAY OUT THERE NOW. I MEAN, THEY'RE A LONG WAY FROM ANYWHERE, AND IF THEY MAKE THE WRONG CHOICE, THEY'RE SUNK. Narrator: LEWIS FOLLOWED THE MUDDY STREAM FOR 40 MILES, FAR ENOUGH TO CONVINCE HIMSELF THAT IT LED TOWARD THE ENDLESS CANADIAN PLAINS, NOT TOWARD THE PACIFIC. HE AND CLARK NAMED IT THE MARIAS, BUT TO A MAN, THE REST OF THE EXPEDITION REMAINED CONVINCED IT WAS THE MISSOURI. Ambrose: NEVERTHELESS, LEWIS AND CLARK MADE THE DECISION-- "WE'RE GOING UP THE LEFT-HAND FORK." THE MEN TOLD THE CAPTAINS, "WE DISAGREE WITH YOU, BUT WE ARE HAPPY TO FOLLOW YOU WHEREVER YOU CHOOSE TO LEAD US." THIS WAS A MARK OF CONFIDENCE IN LEWIS AND CLARK THAT WAS EXQUISITE. [THUNDER] Narrator: ON FOOT, LEWIS AND A SCOUTING PARTY OF 4 MEN PUSHED AHEAD. HE KNEW THAT IF HE COULDN'T FIND THE WATERFALL THAT THE HIDATSAS HAD DESCRIBED TO HIM, THEY HAD TAKEN THE WRONG FORK. ON THE MORNING OF JUNE 13, LEWIS BEGAN HEARING A CONSTANT ROAR IN THE DISTANCE AND THEN ON THE HORIZON SAW WHAT LOOKED LIKE COLUMNS OF SMOKE RISING FROM THE RIVER CHANNEL. HE HURRIED FORWARD FOR 7 MILES. AT LAST, LEWIS REACHED THE SOURCE OF THE NOISE AND SPRAY AND KNEW THAT HE AND CLARK HAD BEEN RIGHT. THERE BEFORE HIM, 300 YARDS WIDE, 80 FEET HIGH, WAS THE GREAT FALLS OF THE MISSOURI. Meriwether Lewis: TO GAZE ON THIS SUBLIMELY GRAND SPECTACLE FORMS THE GRANDEST SIGHT I EVER BEHELD. IRREGULAR AND SOMEWHAT PROJECTING ROCKS BELOW RECEIVE THE WATER IN ITS PASSAGE DOWN AND BREAKS IT INTO A PERFECT WHITE FOAM, WHICH ASSUMES A THOUSAND FORMS IN A MOMENT... SOMETIMES FLYING UP IN JETS OF SPARKLING FOAM TO THE HEIGHT OF 15 OR 20 FEET AND ARE SCARCELY FORMED BEFORE LARGE, ROLLING BODIES OF THE SAME BEATEN AND FOAMING WATER IS THROWN OVER AND CONCEALS THEM. I WISHED THAT I MIGHT BE ENABLED TO GIVE TO THE ENLIGHTENED WORLD SOME JUST IDEA OF THIS TRULY MAGNIFICENT AND SUBLIMELY GRAND OBJECT, WHICH HAS FROM THE COMMENCEMENT OF TIME BEEN CONCEALED FROM THE VIEW OF CIVILIZED MAN. Narrator: LEWIS SENT A MESSAGE BACK DOWNRIVER TELLING CLARK THAT THEY HAD MADE THE RIGHT DECISION AND TO BRING UP THE REST OF THE EXPEDITION. MEANWHILE, HE SCOUTED AHEAD, LOOKING FOR THE EASIEST PLACE TO PORTAGE AROUND THE FALLS. Duncan: AND THEN HE FINDS THAT THERE'S ANOTHER WATERFALL AND THEN ANOTHER AND ANOTHER. IT'S AWFUL PRETTY, BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE A HALF-DAY GETTING AROUND THESE THINGS. Narrator: THEY WOULD HAVE TO PORTAGE AROUND ALL OF THEM, 18 1/2 MILES OVER ROCKY, BROKEN GROUND UNDER A BROILING SUMMER SUN. THEY BUILT CRUDE CARTS OUT OF COTTONWOOD TREES AND HEADED OVERLAND. Meriwether Lewis: THE BUFFALO HAVE TRODDEN UP THE PRAIRIE VERY MUCH. THE SHARP POINTS OF THE EARTH ARE AS HARD AS FROZEN GROUND, AND PRICKLY PEARS STAND UP IN SUCH ABUNDANCE THAT THERE IS NO AVOIDING THEM. THIS IS PARTICULARLY SEVERE ON THE FEET OF THE MEN, WHO HAVE NOT ONLY THEIR OWN WEIGHT TO BEAR IN TREADING ON THOSE HACKLE-LIKE POINTS, BUT HAVE ALSO THE ADDITION OF THE BURDEN WHICH THEY DRAW. William Clark: THE MEN HAVE TO HAUL WITH ALL THEIR STRENGTH AND WEIGHT AND ART... MANY TIMES, EVERY MAN CATCHING THE GRASS AND KNOBS AND STONES WITH THEIR HANDS TO GIVE THEM MORE FORCE IN DRAWING ON THE CANOES AND LOADS. Meriwether Lewis: AT EVERY HALT, THESE POOR FELLOWS TUMBLE DOWN AND ARE SO MUCH FATIGUED THAT MANY OF THEM ARE ASLEEP IN AN INSTANT. OTHERS FAINT AND ARE UNABLE TO STAND FOR A FEW MINUTES. [THUNDER] Narrator: VIOLENT STORMS PUNCTUATED THE HEAT. A FLASH FLOOD NEARLY DROWNED CLARK, CHARBONNEAU, SACAGAWEA, AND HER BABY IN A GULLY. ANOTHER STORM BROUGHT HAILSTONES 7 INCHES IN CIRCUMFERENCE THAT FELL WITH SUCH FURY THAT THE MEN WERE KNOCKED TO THE GROUND. William Clark: THE PARTY RETURNED TO CAMP IN GREAT CONFUSION, ON THE RUN, LEAVING THEIR LOADS IN THE PLAINS. THE HAIL AND WIND BEING SO LARGE AND VIOLENT AND THEM NAKED, THEY WERE MUCH BRUISED AND SOME NEARLY KILLED-- ONE KNOCKED DOWN 3 TIMES, AND OTHERS WITHOUT HATS OR ANYTHING ON THEIR HEADS BLOODY AND COMPLAINED VERY MUCH. I REFRESHED THEM WITH A LITTLE GROG. Meriwether Lewis: THIS EVENING, THE MEN REPAIRED THEIR MOCCASINS AND PUT ON DOUBLE SOLES TO PROTECT THEIR FEET FROM THE PRICKLY PEARS. SOME ARE LIMPING FROM THE SORENESS OF THEIR FEET. John Ordway: JULY 3. ONE PAIR OF GOOD MOCCASINS WILL NOT LAST MORE THAN ABOUT TWO DAYS. WE WEAR HOLES IN THEM FOR THE FIRST DAY AND PATCH THEM FOR THE NEXT. Narrator: AND TO THEIR GREAT CONCERN, SACAGAWEA HAD BECOME SERIOUSLY ILL. WHEN BLEEDING HER DIDN'T WORK, THE CAPTAINS GREW ALARMED. THEY WERE COUNTING ON HER HELP IN GETTING HORSES FROM HER PEOPLE WHEN THEY REACHED THE MISSOURI HEADWATERS. LEWIS GAVE HER DOSES OF OPIUM AND HAD HER DRINK FROM A SULFUR SPRING HE HAD DISCOVERED. FINALLY, SHE BEGAN TO RECOVER. IN THEIR WINTER PLANS, THE CAPTAINS HAD ESTIMATED IT WOULD TAKE HALF A DAY TO GET AROUND THE FALLS. INSTEAD, IT TOOK THEM NEARLY A MONTH. BY EARLY JULY, THE DIFFICULT PORTAGE WAS COMPLETE. John Ordway: JULY 4. A BEAUTIFUL, CLEAR, PLEASANT, WARM DAY. THE FIDDLE WAS PUT IN ORDER, AND THE PARTY AMUSED THEMSELVES DANCING ALL THE EVENING UNTIL ABOUT 10:00 IN A CIVIL AND JOVIAL MANNER. IT BEING THE 4th OF INDEPENDENCE, WE DRANK THE LAST OF OUR ARDENT SPIRITS. JOHN ORDWAY. Ambrose: YOU KNOW, NAPOLEON SAID, WHENEVER YOU SET OFF ON A MARCH, MAKE SURE YOU GOT PLENTY OF BEER AND WINE ALONG, ENOUGH TO LAST UNTIL YOU GET FAR ENOUGH AWAY FROM CAMP SO THAT NOBODY CAN DESERT. AND THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT HAPPENED WITH LEWIS AND CLARK. THEY BROUGHT ENOUGH WHISKEY ALONG TO GET THEM THROUGH TO THE GREAT FALLS, AND THEN THEY RAN OUT. THAT WAS WAY TOO LATE FOR ANYBODY TO DESERT. AND SO THEY CELEBRATED PRETTY HARD. THE MEN GOT A LITTLE TIPSY, ACCORDING TO LEWIS. THEY HAD A GREAT TIME. BUT FOR THE CAPTAINS, THEY KNOW THAT THEY'RE BEHIND SCHEDULE, AND YOU CAN SEE FROM THERE, WAY OFF IN THE DISTANCE ARE THESE MOUNTAINS THAT ARE A LOT BIGGER THAN ANY MOUNTAINS YOU EVER SAW IN VIRGINIA OR NEW HAMPSHIRE. Meriwether Lewis: WE ALL BELIEVE THAT WE ARE NOW ABOUT TO ENTER ON THE MOST PERILOUS AND DIFFICULT PART OF OUR VOYAGE, YET I SEE NO ONE REPINING. ALL APPEAR READY TO MEET THOSE DIFFICULTIES WHICH AWAIT US WITH RESOLUTION AND BECOMING FORTITUDE, AND ALL APPEAR PERFECTLY TO HAVE MADE UP THEIR MINDS TO SUCCEED IN THE EXPEDITION OR PERISH IN THE ATTEMPT. Narrator: THEY WERE BACK ON THE MISSOURI ONCE MORE, BUT INSTEAD OF LEADING THEM FARTHER WEST INTO THE MOUNTAINS, THE RIVER NOW TURNED SOUTH. ON JULY 18, CLARK, YORK, AND TWO OTHER MEN SET OFF OVERLAND, HOPING SOMEHOW TO FIND THE SHOSHONES AND THE HORSES THEY KNEW THEY WOULD NEED TO CROSS THE MOUNTAINS. LEWIS TOOK CHARGE OF THE CANOES. Ambrose: THE SEASON'S WEARING ON. THE DAYS ARE STARTING TO GET SHORTER. EVERY TIME HE'D LOOK TO HIS RIGHT, THERE WERE THOSE MOUNTAINS. HE'S GOT TO GET ACROSS THEM BEFORE WINTER SETS IN, AND THE DAMN RIVER IS GOING THE WRONG WAY. THE RIVER IS GOING SOUTH AND EVEN SOUTHEAST A BIT, BUT HE'S GOT TO FOLLOW THAT RIVER. EVENTUALLY IT'S GOING TO HAVE TO TURN AND GO UP INTO THOSE MOUNTAINS, BUT WHEN? WHERE? Narrator: CLARK RETURNED EMPTY-HANDED. NO SIGN OF THE SHOSHONES. THEN, SOUTH OF WHAT IS NOW HELENA, MONTANA, THE MISSOURI DIVIDED INTO 3 TRIBUTARIES. THE CAPTAINS NAMED THE 3 FORKS THE GALLATIN, THE MADISON, AND THE JEFFERSON AFTER TWO CABINET MEMBERS INSTRUMENTAL IN THE LOUISIANA PURCHASE AND "IN HONOR," LEWIS WROTE, "OF THAT ILLUSTRIOUS PERSONAGE THOMAS JEFFERSON, THE AUTHOR OF OUR ENTERPRISE." THE JEFFERSON POINTED WEST, AND THEY FOLLOWED IT. Duncan: BUT NOW THE RIVERS ARE GETTING SMALLER. THEY'RE GETTING SHALLOWER. IT'S HARDER AND HARDER GOING. THEY'RE PULLING THE CANOES IN THE WATER OVER ROCKS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. IT'S EARLY AUGUST, LATE JULY, AND YET THEY CAN SEE IN THE DISTANCE THAT IT'S SNOWING UP IN SOME OF THE MOUNTAIN PEAKS. THAT'S MIND-BOGGLING. I MEAN, THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN IN VIRGINIA. Meriwether Lewis: AUGUST 2. THE TOPS OF THESE MOUNTAINS ARE YET PARTIALLY COVERED WITH SNOW WHILE WE IN THE VALLEY ARE NEARLY SUFFOCATED WITH THE INTENSE HEAT OF THE MIDDAY SUN. AUGUST 3. THE CURRENT MUCH MORE SHALLOW THAN USUAL. IN MANY PLACES, THEY WERE OBLIGED TO DOUBLE-MAN THE CANOES AND DRAG THEM OVER THE STONE AND GRAVEL. AUGUST 5. THE MEN WERE SO MUCH FATIGUED TODAY THAT THEY WISHED MUCH THAT NAVIGATION WAS AT AN END, THAT THEY MIGHT GO BY LAND. Narrator: NOTHING SEEMED TO BE GOING RIGHT. TOWROPES SNAPPED, AND CANOES OVERTURNED IN THE SWIFT WATER. ONE OF THEM NEARLY CRUSHED JOSEPH WHITEHOUSE TO DEATH IN THE ROCKY STREAMBED. THE JEFFERSON ITSELF FORKED INTO SMALLER STREAMS, CAUSING YET ANOTHER DELAY. AND STILL THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF THE SHOSHONES AND THEIR HORSES. "IF WE DO NOT FIND THEM," LEWIS CONFIDED TO HIS JOURNAL, "I FEAR THE SUCCESSFUL ISSUE OF OUR VOYAGE WILL BE VERY DOUBTFUL." THE ONLY SOLACE CAME FROM SACAGAWEA. UP TO THIS POINT, THE ROUTE THE EXPEDITION HAD TAKEN WAS AS UNKNOWN TO HER AS TO THE OTHER EXPLORERS, BUT STARTING AT THE 3 FORKS, SHE BEGAN TO RECOGNIZE FAMILIAR TERRITORY. Meriwether Lewis: THE INDIAN WOMAN RECOGNIZED THE POINT OF A HIGH PLAIN. THIS HILL, SHE SAYS, HER NATION CALLS THE BEAVER'S HEAD. SHE ASSURES US THAT WE SHALL EITHER FIND HER PEOPLE ON THIS RIVER OR ON THE RIVER IMMEDIATELY WEST OF ITS SOURCE, WHICH FROM ITS PRESENT SIZE CANNOT BE VERY DISTANT. Ambrose: TO HAVE SACAGAWEA SAY TO THEM, "THAT'S THE BEAVERHEAD. WE'RE ON THE RIGHT TRAIL," OH, THAT LIFTED SPIRITS WHEN SPIRITS WERE VERY LOW AND THEY THOUGHT THEY'D NEVER COME TO AN END OF THIS JOURNEY. Narrator: NOW IT WAS LEWIS' TURN TO SCOUT AHEAD FOR THE SHOSHONES AND THEIR HORSES. Meriwether Lewis: I DETERMINE TO PROCEED AHEAD TOMORROW WITH A SMALL PARTY TO THE SOURCE OF THIS RIVER AND PAST THE MOUNTAINS TO THE COLUMBIA AND DOWN THAT RIVER UNTIL I FIND THE INDIANS. IT IS MY RESOLUTION TO FIND THEM OR SOME OTHERS WHO HAVE HORSES IF IT SHOULD CAUSE ME A TRIP OF ONE MONTH. Narrator: 3 DAYS LATER, ON AUGUST 11, LEWIS' ADVANCE PARTY SAW AN INDIAN ON HORSEBACK IN THE DISTANCE, THE FIRST INDIAN THEY HAD SEEN SINCE LEAVING THE MANDAN VILLAGES 4 MONTHS EARLIER. LEWIS WAS OVERJOYED AT THE SIGHT AND LAID DOWN HIS GUN TO SIGNAL THAT HIS INTENTIONS WERE FRIENDLY. Ambrose: LEWIS HAD HAD THE FORESIGHT TO ASK SACAGAWEA, "WHAT'S THE SHOSHONE WORD FOR FRIEND?" AND SHE SAID, "IT'S TAB-BA-BONE." LEWIS STRIPPED HIS SLEEVE BACK TO SHOW THE INDIAN-- HE WAS SO SUNTANNED, HE LOOKED LIKE AN INDIAN-- TO SHOW THE INDIAN THAT HE WAS A WHITE MAN AND STARTED SHOUTING, "TAB-BA-BONE! TAB-BA-BONE!" IT TURNS OUT THAT SACAGAWEA HAD MISUNDERSTOOD HIM. TAB-BA-BONE WAS THE SHOSHONE WORD FOR STRANGER. THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY WORD FOR WHITE MAN. THE INDIAN, WATCHING THESE MEN APPROACH, WHEELED HIS HORSE AROUND AND DISAPPEARED, SO LEWIS EMOTIONALLY WENT FROM JUST EXULTATION TO THE DEEPEST DESPAIR. THE CHANCE TO GET THOSE HORSES HAD QUITE POSSIBLY PASSED MAYBE FOREVER. Narrator: THE NEXT DAY WAS AUGUST 12. THE SHIPMENT THE CAPTAINS HAD SENT FROM FORT MANDAN FINALLY REACHED THE EAST COAST. PRESIDENT JEFFERSON WOULD HANG THE ELK ANTLERS ON THE WALL OF HIS HOME, PLANT THE INDIAN CORN IN HIS MONTICELLO GARDEN, AND SEND THE TWO SURVIVING ANIMALS-- A MAGPIE AND THE PRAIRIE DOG-- TO THE NATION'S PREEMINENT NATURAL-SCIENCE MUSEUM-- INDEPENDENCE HALL IN PHILADELPHIA, WHERE 30 YEARS EARLIER, JEFFERSON HAD HELPED CREATE THE NATION THAT NOW STRETCHED TO THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS. Duncan: WHAT A SYMBOL. IN THE PLACE WHERE THE AMERICAN NATION HAD BEEN BORN, IN A CAGE WAS THIS LITTLE PRAIRIE DOG THAT LEWIS AND CLARK HAD SPENT AN AFTERNOON OUT IN THE WEST TRYING TO DROWN OUT OF ITS HOLE TO SEND BACK TO THE SCIENTIST PRESIDENT. Narrator: AS HE SIFTED THROUGH THE SPECIMENS, READ LEWIS' CONFIDENT LETTER ABOUT THEIR PLANS, AND SPREAD OUT CLARK'S MAP ON THE FLOOR OF MONTICELLO, JEFFERSON WOULD HAVE IMAGINED THEM ALREADY THROUGH THE NORTHWEST PASSAGE AND AT THE WESTERN OCEAN. BUT THE CORPS OF DISCOVERY WAS NOWHERE NEAR THE SEA. INSTEAD, MERIWETHER LEWIS WAS ABOUT TO LEARN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN IMAGINARY MOUNTAINS ON A MAP AND THE REAL THING. Meriwether Lewis: AUGUST 12. THIS MORNING, I SENT DROUILLARD OUT AS SOON AS IT WAS LIGHT TO TRY AND DISCOVER WHAT ROUTE THE INDIAN HAD TAKEN. WE EVENTUALLY FELL IN WITH A LARGE AND PLAIN INDIAN ROAD. I THEREFORE DID NOT DESPAIR OF SHORTLY FINDING A PASSAGE OVER THE MOUNTAINS. Narrator: THE WELL-WORN INDIAN TRAIL LED DUE WEST UP A GENTLE RISE TOWARD A RIDGELINE. A SMALL CREEK RAN BESIDE IT. Ambrose: AFTER THE INDIAN DISAPPEARED, LEWIS DETERMINED TO FOLLOW HIS TRAIL BACK TO THE VILLAGE. HE REALLY HAD NO CHOICE ABOUT IT. HE HAD TO GET CONTACT WITH THE SHOSHONES. HE FOLLOWED THE TRACK. IT LED HIM UP A CREEK TILL FINALLY HE CAME TO A SPRING, AND WITH ALL THE ANXIETY AND FEAR THAT HE WAS FEELING, HE NEVERTHELESS WAS ABLE TO PAUSE AND DRINK OUT OF THAT SPRING COMING OUT OF THE SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN AND TO EXULT THAT HE HAD REACHED THE ULTIMATE SOURCE OF THE MISSOURI RIVER. Meriwether Lewis: HUGH McNEAL STOOD WITH A FOOT ON EACH SIDE OF THIS LITTLE RIVULET AND THANKED HIS GOD THAT HE HAD LIVED TO BESTRIDE THE MIGHTY AND HERETOFORE DEEMED ENDLESS MISSOURI. FARTHER UP WAS THE MOST DISTANT FOUNTAIN OF THE WATERS OF THE MIGHTY MISSOURI, IN SEARCH OF WHICH WE HAVE SPENT SO MANY TOILSOME DAYS AND RESTLESS NIGHTS. THUS FAR, I HAD ACCOMPLISHED ONE OF THOSE GREAT OBJECTS ON WHICH MY MIND HAS BEEN UNALTERABLY FIXED FOR MANY YEARS. JUDGE THEN OF THE PLEASURE I FELT IN ALLAYING MY THIRST FROM THIS PURE AND ICE-COLD WATER. Narrator: NOW LEWIS BEGAN CLIMBING THE REST OF THE RIDGE. HE WAS APPROACHING THE CONTINENTAL DIVIDE, THE SPINE OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS, BEYOND WHICH THE RIVERS FLOW WEST. NO AMERICAN CITIZEN HAD EVER BEEN THERE BEFORE. THIS, HE BELIEVED, WAS THE NORTHWEST PASSAGE THAT HAD BEEN THE GOAL OF EXPLORERS FOR MORE THAN 300 YEARS, THE GREAT PRIZE WHICH THOMAS JEFFERSON HAD SENT HIM TO FIND AND CLAIM FOR THE UNITED STATES. Duncan: FROM THE TIME THAT LEWIS HAD BEEN WORKING IN THE WHITE HOUSE WITH THOMAS JEFFERSON, HE'D BEEN PREPARING HIMSELF FOR A DAY WHEN HE WOULD COME TO THE CONTINENTAL DIVIDE, FIND THE NORTHWEST PASSAGE. HE WAS GOING TO CLIMB A RIDGE, AND WHEN HE LOOKED OUT, HE WOULD SEE WHAT ALL GEOGRAPHERS HAD SAID YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO SEE. HE ANTICIPATED SEEING IN FRONT OF HIM WHAT WAS BEHIND HIM. HE THOUGHT HE WOULD SEE THE SAME THING ON THE OTHER SIDE-- AN EASY DESCENT DOWN TO THE COLUMBIA RIVER, ONE DAY'S PORTAGE OVER THIS MOUNTAIN PASS. YOU COULD HAUL THE CANOES ON YOUR BACK, PUT THEM ONTO THE WATER ON THE OTHER SIDE, AND YOU'RE HOME FREE. YOU COULD JUST FLOAT ON DOWN TO THE PACIFIC OCEAN. HIS HEART MUST HAVE BEEN RACING LIKE CRAZY BECAUSE IT'S THE SUPREME MOMENT OF THE EXPEDITION, AND HE WALKS UP TO THIS RIDGE, AND WHEN HE GOT THERE, HE LOOKED OUT, AND ALL HE SAW WERE MORE MOUNTAINS. THERE WAS JUST MOUNTAIN AFTER MOUNTAIN AFTER MOUNTAIN AFTER MOUNTAIN. Ambrose: AND WHAT HE SAW WHEN HE TOOK THAT FIRST STEP OUT OF THE UNITED STATES AND INTO UNCLAIMED TERRITORY BROUGHT AN END TO A DREAM THAT HAD BEGUN WITH COLUMBUS, THE DREAM OF AN ALL-WATER ROUTE FROM EUROPE TO THE FAR EAST. Allen: THE GEOGRAPHY OF REALITY AND THE GEOGRAPHY OF HOPE WERE CLASHING AT THAT POINT. IT HAS TO BE A SITUATION IN WHICH HE FEELS TREMENDOUS ELATION, AS HE EXPRESSES IN THE JOURNALS ABOUT THANKING GOD THAT HE'S LIVED TO BESTRIDE THE MIGHTY MISSOURI, BUT TREMENDOUS DISAPPOINTMENT AT THE RECOGNITION THAT HIS PRECONCEIVED IDEAS ABOUT WHAT WAS WEST OF THIS LAST DIVIDING RIDGE SIMPLY WEREN'T TRUE. Duncan: AND WHEN HE WAS STANDING THERE AND YOU SEE ALL OF THOSE MOUNTAINS, YOU KNOW THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE A HALF-DAY PORTAGE. IT'S GOING TO BE A LOT HARDER, AND TIME'S A-WASTING. IT'S AUGUST, AND IT'S ALREADY SNOWING IN CERTAIN PLACES, AND YOU'D BETTER GET A MOVE ON BECAUSE IF IT SNOWS, THEY'RE DONE. THEY'RE GOING TO DIE. Narrator: LEWIS HAD NO TIME NOW TO CONTEMPLATE HIS DISAPPOINTMENT. HE DESPERATELY NEEDED TO FIND HORSES FOR THE EXPEDITION TO CROSS THE DAUNTING MOUNTAINS THAT STRETCHED OUT BEFORE HIM. THE SUCCESS-- PERHAPS THE VERY SURVIVAL OF THEM ALL-- DEPENDED ON IT.
