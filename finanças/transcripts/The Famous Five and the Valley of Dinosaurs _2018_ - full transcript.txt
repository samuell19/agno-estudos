W... wait. l... I'll help you. Oh, thank you. That's kind of you. Thanks. Do you have any flowers? Yes. It's my father's birthday. Have a good day. Your father too. Hey, stop... Stop that! G... go away! Happy birthday, Dad. I miss you. Marty Bach Junior! My old friend! We... we're not friends, Kurt Weiler. Why would you say that? Huh? And... Wh... What are you doing here? Your father owes me money. For the generator. - My... my father's been dead two years. - I know, I know. And I think that's really a terrible pity. I still need my money. - Are you taking the piss? Huh? - Th... that's all I have. There must be something. - What's in there? - It belongs to me. That wasn't the question. I want to know what's in... What the hell... is that? A bone? Hey, I asked you a question! Fool! Gorgosaurus libratus, a theropod dinosaur. A late-Campanian bipedal carnivore of the Tyrannosauridae family. This is a dinosaur bone? Where did you get it? Fr... from my father. Maybe your dad wasn't a crank like they say he was. If it really is a dinosaur bone, it has to be worth a few euros. It... it belongs to me. You mustn't steal it. Who said anything about stealing? I'll just borrow it, yeah, Marty? For always. You're a thief! I think you understand me. THE FAMOUS FIVE AND THE VALLEY OF THE DINOSAURS Should we have taken the last exit? According to the map, there'll be another exit in about 30 km, Aunt Fanny. Still no signal. - We're lost. - Oh well... - No rush. The wedding is in two days. - I still don't get why we have to go. - Your cousin might marry a fourth time. - George! We've discussed this. What if you married? - I'm sure you'd want your cousins there. - Oh yes! I could be bridesmaid. - I'd love that. - Cool! Anne, I think George was... - ...being sarcastic. - You're jealous. No one will marry you! - Not with that hairdo, at least. - Heh? - Don't! - Stop it, please. I have to... get a new car. It's about three kilometres to the next town. Three kilometres? Oh no! It'll be hours until we get there! Well now, it is well known that the average walking speed is 4.2 kilometres an hour. So you need to multiply three kilometres by 60 minutes and divide that by 4.2. What's up? I can't help being so brainy. Let's go, or it will take hours. - 42.857 minutes! - Come on! It can't be much further. Thank God it isn't raining. Evening. Can I help you? Yes. I mean, I hope you can. Do you have a room for us? Well, this is a hotel. Come inside. Is this some kind of themed hotel? What makes you think that? It's all perfectly normal and boring. So... Here are your rooms. Bang, bang! We can discuss the rest in the morning. Good night, kiddies. Uh, thank you. Very kind. I'm so tired. I'm going straight to bed. Good night. Oh, dear! That doesn't sound good at all. - I hope she isn't going to be... - Uh-uh. You keep your mouth shut. - But... - Shh! I said no pets. Don't start questioning me about that... That... That was a dog there! - That depends. - On what? It was a dog! I saw it with my own eyes! - Morning! - Morning. - Morning. - Morning. Are you okay? Where's Aunt Fanny. Tell me she isn't... ill? I'm afraid she is. We'll be here a few days. No! - And what about the wedding? - That will go ahead. But without us. Is this cousin really marrying for the third time? - The probability of a fourth wedding... - Dick! - What? I was talking to George. - I know that man from somewhere. I don't believe it! I'm utterly speechless! - That'd be amazing. - So who is he then? - Professor Herzog? - Yes? - George Kirrin, the daughter of... - Oh yes, George! What a surprise! - Is your father here too? - He's a famous... I mean, he is the famous palaeontologist. - And what is a paletto-thing? - Palaeontologist. That's a scientist who studies fossils. Herzog specializes in fossilized bones. He's a dinosaur expert! - Come over here. - She wants us to go over there. Well, then... I can do this. I can do this. This is Julian. - Anne. - Barbara. And this is my cousin... Dick. Yes, well, sadly we have to be going now... But, as I said, you shouldn't miss out on that. - It sounds fascinating. - Dick... I hope you'll come too. - Goodbye, children. - Bye. See you. Where does he hope I'll come? Mr Mayor, can you tell us with certainty that this bone really comes from a dinosaur? I myself am no expert, of course. Our expert is Professor Carl Herzog. The renowned scientist studied the bone for us. He confirmed that this fossil truly is a bone that's over 65 million years old and once belonged to a dinosaur. That's so cool. May we assume there are more of them? We thoroughly explored the site where the bone was found by our esteemed friend, Mr Kurt Weiler. Nothing, I'm afraid. - But of course that doesn't... - Wrong! It's all lies! W... Weiler didn't find the bone. He stole it. He's a crook. My father found the bone. And there are more. A whole valley full of bones! One moment. Wait! And... where might we find this valley? I don't know. Come on, Marty. Enough of this nonsense. Ladies and gentlemen, I should explain. Marty's father was Marty Bach Senior. We knew him as a man who was fascinated by dinosaurs and became obsessed with the dream of uncovering a major find one day. That dream was not realized. Sadly. And stop spreading lies like that. Weiler stole it. Button it, pal. Who are you? I'm Marty. Professor. - Well? Did I promise too much? - No. - Not at all. - It was great. That was a strange moment with that Marty fellow. I was told that's not the first time he's tried to save his dad's reputation. What if he's right and there really are more bones? - Wouldn't that be a sensation? - Indeed it would. Indeed it would. Ah, your daughter. Barbara is my wife. - My turtle dove! How is your headache? - I think the Prof likes me. Let's go get ice cream. Timmy? - Oh no. - Timmy. Let's go. This way! It came from over there! You'll regret humiliating me! Leave me alone, or the dog will bite your bum. I'm not done with you. I promise you that! Th... Thank you, doggie. - Leave me be, or the dog will... - Timmy! Bite your bum. Well done. He came along with me. Really. l... I'm not lying. It's okay. You're Marty, right? Was that the man from the museum? Weiler is a liar. Where are you going? Home. Should we go together? Let's go, Timmy. This rain's getting on my nerves! - So, this is my house. - Wow! Cool! Your hotel is in that direction. But you can come in. - And wait for the rain to stop. - Yes, please. The living room is that way. You have a dog as well? W... would you like something to drink? - No, thanks. - No, thanks. Palaeontology! Wow! Have you read them all? Cool! This is for you, Timmy. Thanks again for helping me. Is this your father? That's mine! Anne didn't want... I mean... We don't want to steal anything. Look! There's something stuck to the photo. That's odd. What are those numbers? I... I don't know. May I take a look at them? Those two rocks from the photo, they're also on the map. These symbols would seem to suggest... They're coordinates! Marty, in the museum you said something about a valley. These could be the coordinates... But it belongs to you. My father wasn't a crank. He wasn't. I think we'd better go. It's getting late. Maybe we'll see you again tomorrow. See you. - Kind of weird, huh? - Yeah. Those two rocks on the photo. I've seen them before. Really? Here. They're the same rocks. Twin Brothers. The rocks are called that. No idea why. - It's a stupid name. - Maybe because they're almost identical. Like twins. Yeah. Right. Okay, kiddies, want to take the tour? Put your names down. It's the last tour before the bridge gets repaired. Then there'll be no bridge for a year. And no way to get over there. Capiche? - We'll think about it. - You do that. Come on, Timmy. It's well cool. - If they really are coordinates... - What else can they be? - They might lead to the dinosaur valley. - Starting from where his dad was. By these Twin Brothers. Sounds plausible to me. Then Marty's father was right. - The valley exists. - Right! And we'll help him find it. It didn't seem to me that Marty really trusted us. We have to show him that we're the good guys. Yes, we'll do that. Let's go to sleep now. - We'll discuss it tomorrow. - Good night. Good night! Scientific study of dinosaur bones began in the 19th century, and today there are digs on all of Earth's continents. It isn't only palaeontologists who are keen to find dinosaur skeletons. More and more people around the world are willing to pay millions to find one. The larger and more complete it is, the more valuable the skeleton. An Asian billionaire recently offered a renowned palaeontologist ten million euros for a dinosaur skeleton... - I hope Marty's at home. - Hey, do you see that? The police. Something's happened. Quick! Let me summarize that. - At around ten p.m. a masked man... - Marty! - Marty, what happened? - Hold it! This is a police investigation. You can't just... It's not appropriate. - Who are you anyway? - We're Marty's friends. - Friends? - Yes. Okay, if you say so. Well? Got anything to add? - We don't know what happened. - The photo's been stolen. - What? - No! - No way! - Quite a remarkable haul. A photo with some scribbled numbers on the back. I don't see what's so funny about it. - Marty has been injured. - Marty... Could you see who it was? He was wearing a mask. I don't know. - L... W... Weiler... - Stop accusing respectable citizens! - Without any evidence. - We are witnesses. - We saw Weiler threatening Marty. - Yeah. Know what? You're wasting my time. Isn't it possible, Marty, that you simply fell over or something? That you banged your head, causing your own injury? You have a good think now, Marty. Maybe you'll remember where you put your valuable photo. What? What... But... You can't just walk away from this! - You have to do something! - Oh, my God! I'm so furious. Does he think you're crazy? - We'll have to deal with this ourselves. - Right. Come on. - What's he reading? - It's Magic Max. A superhero comic. Max forces villains to confess. - He's also a clairvoyant. - Wow! - A clairvoyant is... - I know what it is. Stop it! Let's work out how to lure him away from there. - Yeah? - It's me, Marty. Marty! I have something for you. Yeah? What's that, you twit? You'll see. - Hey, tell me what it is. Spit it out. - You'll see soon enough. Jesus! No silly tricks, okay? - Of course. Come over to my place. - Okay. I hope for your sake it's worth it. Moron! That was a great idea, Marty. We need something to force the door open. I'll just go in. I'll come with you. I... I'll wait outside. I'll wait with you. - It smells like Dick's room. - Very funny. Joke! This guy has every edition of Magic Max! What a nerd! - May I ask you something? - Of course. - Why are you helping me? - It's the right thing to do. Maybe he has the photo in his pocket or something. Magic Max would force him to confess where he hid it. - But he isn't real. - Dick, you're a genius. Yes, I am. - You know about electronics, right? - I do. Tschangis 320 voice changer. Really old, but really good. Why are you asking? We're on. Check, check. Hello! One, two, three, four. You hear me? - Can you see me? - Check. We see and hear you. Can you hear me? Julian! Weiler's coming back. Get out! Julian, your jacket! Stupid Marty! Weiler's coming through the door. The window! Looks like he didn't notice anything. I did it. Great picture! How's the sound quality? Now it smells like Dick's room. Ha-ha. So funny! Okay, let's do it. Do it, Dick! You have good taste, as far as comics are concerned, Kurt Weiler! Sit down. We have to talk. Put your beer down! How do you know... Who are you? Oh, come on. I'm sure you know. I don't. - Think about it. - What? In front of you. Max! Magic Max? I can't believe it! What do you want? I haven't done anything wrong. - Are you quite sure? - Absolutely positive. What about Marty? Marty? Uh... I don't know anyone called Marty. You're lying! And liars must be punished! I placed a force field around the door. Max, please! Please, I... I know Marty. I... I won't do anything else to him. Please don't hurt me. If you ever get mess around with Marty again, you're done for! - Do you understand? - Yes. I won't. I swear. - Most definitely. - And now, the photo. What photo? The photo with the coordinates that you stole last night. I didn't steal anything. Kurt Weiler, you're lying! Max... Wait a minute. Last night, you say... Last night. That can't be. I was at Barny's Bar. Honest! I swear, Magic Max! I'll check. - If I find out that you're lying... - I'm not! - Don't interrupt me! - Sorry. If I find out that you're lying, I will come back, and next time you won't get off so lightly. Okay, I hear what you're saying, Max... Magic Max. Hasta la vista, baby! Max? Are you still... Magic Max? - Did it work? - Sure thing. - So what did we achieve? - Weiler will leave Marty alone now. But he seems to have an alibi for yesterday. "Barny's Bar." Yes. Thank you. Goodbye. Barny confirmed the alibi. To use the map, the thief has to go to the Twin Brothers. - A tour participant must be the thief. - What do you have to think about? The last tour. After that, tick, tick, boom. If you don't sign up, you can't cross the bridge. That means no one can go there without joining the tour group. Right. You got it. I didn't know you lot liked hiking. - Three days, you say? - That's right. Staying overnight in an old castle. It's all in there. Please! Well, here with me you'd only catch a cold. Nature lovers and hiking fans! I hope you're all fit. I'm Harald Beck. Friends call me Becky. Look at the brochure. - You will see... - Your brochure's ancient. Not a word about the discovery of a dinosaur bone. Are your marketing people fools? As I was saying, friends call me Becky. Friends? I missed something. - Besides... - Let Becky finish. Who are you? I was saying... Shut up! My brother and I want to enjoy a nice little hiking trip and if you're not interested in that then just stay here! Otherwise, I'd ask you to stop putting everyone in a bad mood. You got that? Fine. Uh, I don't have much more to say. I'm very excited. You are welcome to keep taking pictures but you won't get a signal. Later on, in the castle, we will be able to contact the outside world via radio. - Any more questions? - Watch it, you. Great, then it's time to say... Bada-bing! Off we pop! PARTICIPANTS - Bada-bing. Off you pop. - Pop! Let's go! Fans and followers, here's Christa, out here with my brother Walter. - He's behind the camera. Say hi, Walter. - Hi. You know me! We're on a lovely hike. We're heading for some rocks called Twin Brothers. I'll keep you updated on where we are. Now I'll present my hiking family. This is Harald Beck, our hiking and climbing guide. - His friends call him Becky. - Okay! Bada-bing, hiking fans! That way is the Schiller Valley. Schiller Valley! But we're going that way! Schiller Valley! Here are Marty and Pedro. - Hi. Hello. - Hola! Todo vale Ia pena... - Todo vale la pena... - Uh-huh. - Si el alma no es pequena. - Si el alma no es pequena. It's difficult. This is Gottfried Meyer. Gottfried used to be a police inspector. - A fine figure of a man. - ls there no pub around here? Give us a wave. Please. The weather is very changeable out here. And this is the famous Professor Herzog and his daughter... sister... I mean, wife! Barbara! Do you have any children? No, we don't have any children. Get loose! We pluck, we pick, the apples, the pears... Anne, George, Julian, Dick and Timmy the dog. The "Famous Five". We get on famously. I don't know about Becky. He's goes out and does his thing but he seems so... so superficial. And he's vain. I consider him a suspect. Gottfried? Hmm. Well, we've got to know him. He isn't exactly loveable. He used to be a policeman and loves to complain. - This weird weather! - I wouldn't put it past him. Walter and Christa are so normal that just isn't normal. Adults who keep posting selfies? That's pretty suspicious. Ah, super! Marty, what do you think of Pedro? He's... he's nice. una buena persona. Want some sausage, huh? And the Herzogs? The Herzogs? Oh, come off it! Carl and Barbara have invited me to visit them. I think that for them I'm like the son they never had. So... So what now? One of them must have stolen the photo. But who? We can't exactly search their bags. Sounds like a plan. Did I miss something? Okay. Bada-bing! Before the fog gets any worse! Off we pop! Super-duper! Here we are! The Twin Brothers! I like 'em. Don't worry, Marty. We can do this. Bada-bing! Oh, what now? My ankle. What a stupid thing to happen. I can't walk anymore. My God! Come on. Walter... - Yes? - Right. - Everyone. - And up! Vamos! - Are you alright, turtle clove? - Up over this hill. The castle is there. There's a bench. Welcome to Marberg Castle! Ah, here we are! Bada... bing! May I... present Hans Beck? - My charming twin brother. - I'm the better looking, cleverer one. - What's up with your foot? - I know! Last tour of the season. Look what happens! - It may be better tomorrow. - I hope so. We have plans. - Follow me, please. - Yes, you go ahead. - I have to rest a little longer. - Faker! I'll take this. Come along with me. As you will notice, the castle has seen better days. But it's ideal for those seeking peace and solitude. These steps continue up into the tower, Count Constantine's prison for 30 long years. But you don't need to hear that now. This way! Mind your heads! Mind your feet! The ladies' dormitory is up there, the men's is here. Dogs don't belong inside. They sleep in the barn. What? I refuse to leave my dog on his own. Thanks for keeping me company and sleeping here too. No problem. It's more chilled than in the dormitories. Check, check. Okay. - It works. - You all know what to do? Ready? - Okay, let's go. - Come on, Timmy. Soup..- Que' noche! - I'm hungry like the wolf. - Hungry as a horse. Twit! - Hi. - Kids! Just the two of you? Sorry, the three of you! There's space over here. - Where are the others? - They... They... They are inside the castle, searching your rucksacks. You're hilarious! Yes! He really is. - Very funny. - Are you hungry? Vitamine! Vitamine, vitamine! Vitamine. Damn it! Damn it to hell! Damn it to hell! It's not me who has to eat it. It's not me who has to eat it... What? Dirt is good for your immune system. Help yourselves! Delicious organic fruit. Organic! I bet that fruit hasn't even been washed. I've been talking to Becky about his foot. If it isn't better tomorrow evening, I'll lead you to Schiller Valley. In any case, you can spend tomorrow as you wish. - Anyone have plans? - Yes. Barbara and I will get up early to watch the sun come up in the Gratzmann Ravine. Okay, the coast is clear. - How about you? - We... We... Uh... We haven't talked about that yet. We'll see. Look, Mrs Herzog works for a company that makes medicines. A pharmacist, with a PhD. Good-looking and intelligent. Like me. - The photo isn't here. - Nor in Christa's bag. Okay. The men's dormitory. Come on. You see, Gottfried? This is a wonderful little trip. You don't always have to be such a grump. I'll be right back. - Oh no. - A walkie-talkie! Christa, look! Let me. Give me the batteries. Thanks. There! I put them in the wrong way round. - I'll do it. - Wait... You have to... Perhaps you'd like to go for coffee with me some time? Marty to Dick. Hello? My dear Christa, welcome to my realm. Isn't it a little dark? I'll turn on the light for you. How cosy! Hang on... Something isn't right here. I heard something. And I smelled something. Don't worry, Christa. Everything is fine. Have no fear. That's quite sweet. Not as sweet as you. Now, my dear Christa... come with me. - What was that? - He's so weird! - He's not right in the head. - And he fancies Christa! Ah, Gottfried, there you are! - I thought I'd scared you away. - Oh no. Everything is fine. - I don't believe it! The map! - What? Look! - Becky's rucksack! - I knew he and his brother were fishy! The thing with the sprained ankle was just a trick! So that he can sneak off tomorrow and look for the valley. So wrong! That'll send those two fools on a wild goose chase. We had to leave the photo there. So that Becky didn't smell a rat. Great job. Timmy seems to really like you. I used to have a dog. Cookie. They took him away from me. Because... Because I couldn't look after him, they said. What nonsense! Why shouldn't you be able to look after a dog? Marty... What does that mean, anyway? That... That everything's going to be okay. It calms me down. My dad always said I shouldn't listen to what other people say. Words can hurt. Listen to people's hearts instead. The heart doesn't lie. It has its own language. When your dad found the dinosaur skeleton why didn't he make it known? When... When I was your age Dad came home, really excited. He told everyone he'd found dinosaur bones. But they were only... only... the bones of a dead cow. So everyone laughed at him. He wanted to prove that he wasn't a crank. Then, one clay... he brought me a genuine dinosaur bone. The bone Weiler stole. Yes. And Dad said he'd dig up the rest of it. So that people would believe him. And so that I could be proud of him. So... What happened after that? He died. He never told me where he found the bones. Instead he drew the coordinates on the back of the photo. - Tomorrow we'll find the dino skeleton. - Yes. We'll show everyone your dad was right. So, we should probably go to sleep. Yes. Tomorrow is a busy day. Yeah. - Good night. - Good night. Come on! Another 52 metres to the north then 100 metres to the west. Come on. This way. Here. Destination reached. This has to be it! The Valley of the Dinosaurs. Hey, come here! Maybe a baby dinosaur. Oryctolagus cuniculus. A wild rabbit. I can't go on. How much longer do we have to keep digging? Keep going. There must be something. There must be something. A Stegosaurus... A Brachiosaurus... Tyrannosaurus... There must be something. They were right. - My father was... was a crank. - Hey, Marty! No! You mustn't think like that! Get off! He was a crank! - His son is too. His son is a crank too. - Marty, calm down. No one thinks that! Marty, don't go! Everything's all right. Truly! I... I want to be on my own for a while. I'll go back to the castle, yeah? What now? You heard what he said. He wants to be alone. Maybe I missed something or other. - You've never made a mistake. - True. So it can't be. Come on, let's get packed up. It'll be dark soon. - Can we take a break? - Yes. And let's take a look at the map. We didn't come this way before. We should have passed the Twin Brothers by now. Great! Now we've got ourselves lost! It's probably not that bad, just a little detour. I think the Twin Brothers are back there. George! George! George? - Are you all right? - Yes, I'm fine. Can you climb back up? Yes, I can. But... Pass me a torch. - Dick. - Okay. Come back up! Before something happens to you! Didn't you hear what I said? The entrance to a cave! Come down here! This is unbelievable! Go on, Dick. Of course we'll be careful, Timmy. You wait there for us. Okay. Let's keep going. Be careful. It's quite slippery. Incredible. Completely fitted and furnished! Judging by the dust, no one's been here in a while. Look at this. A diary! That's Marty. The diary of Marty Bach Senior. Marty's dad! Amazing! The first entry is 12 years ago. And the last one? "Today I exposed the final remaining bones. I now know that my Gorgosaurus libratus is a complete skeleton." What? 8 September 2015. - Let's go. - Okay. A generator. It's pretty dark down here. Don't be frightened, Anne. It's only a dinosaur. Awesome! Unbelievable! Incredible! Gorgosaurus libratus, a theropod. A dinosaur of the late Campanian age. A bipedal carnivore. - We've found it. - But... - But how can this be? - Well, they're fossils. They got covered in sedimentary rock, so can survive millions of years. Erosion gradually reveals dinosaur bones that were under the surface. But this is a cave. Some caves are made when water under the earth's surface gradually drains away, leaving a hollow. So the skeleton was revealed. D'you understand? - No. - Okay, I'll start from the beginning. No, no. We did understand after all. Tyrannosaurus Bachae. After the man who discovered it, Marty Bach. Amazing. Incredible. Marty? Marty! He's probably in the barn. Marty? Hey, kids! I've been waiting for you. My charming brother and the group have set out for the Schiller Valley. - And Marty? - Don't know. I thought he was with you. Pedro and the Herzogs will be here soon. We should set off too. - What have you done with Marty? - Why should I have done anything? We know that you're a thief and want the dino bones. Sorry? What? 'Yes! ' We found the valley ourselves. Have you been in the sun too long? Good trick with the sprained ankle! What are you doing? Have you gone mad? - Becky... - Carl, Marty's dad was right! Here! Take a look for yourself! Gorgosaurus libratus! A dinosaur in the Tyrannosauridae family! Fantastic! - What's going on? - Look what the children found. Sensational! Very nice. Shut up! You hit Marty and stole the map! What nonsense are you talking? What map? - The map that leads to the dinosaur. - And then you gave Becky the wrong map. To lead us astray! - Turtle clove, tell them... - Don't touch me! That... That's a gun! I know that, you fool. Well, haven't you clone a marvellous job? Saw through our game, did you? 'Why "Our" game» "Oh! ' Oh, did I say "our"? Hola, amigos! - Do we have a problem? - You're doing it with Barbara? Not so much recently, but you're a very clever boy. I didn't want to tell you, Carlie, but... - Pedro and I... - We're in love. - How long has this been going on? - A very long time already. But that isn't really your problem now. - You all have a different problem. - So many problems! Because we can't have anyone knowing about the dinosaur. - Let's go! - Vamos! - Oh, turtle dove! - Shush, Professor! If we don't go to the Schiller Valley my brother will send out a search party. That's a problem. - No! - There you are! Please, leave Marty be. He doesn't know about the dinosaur. Tell him to go to the Schiller Valley and say that everything's fine here. One wrong word and you're all done for. l... I wanted to apologize to you. For earlier. That's fine, Marty. No problem. Okay. - The others have gone. Should we go too? - No, we'll stay here one more night. Could you go to the Schiller Valley and tell them? Why... What am I supposed to tell them? That everything is fine here. - I thought we were going together. - We want to do things alone. We don't want to upset you but... Marty, just piss off, okay? - Fool - Piss off, you twit! You odd person, get out of here! - You're a weirdo! - What a loser! - Get lost! - Go! - Fool - Twit! Why are you saying this? - We want nothing to do with you. - Get lost! You fool! You have to be good now. Or Barbara will be angry. Now, senores y senoras, in you go. So, you can enjoy the view while we go and take the bones away at our leisure tomorrow. You'll never get them to the surface in one piece. Your smart aleck ways are adorable and I don't want to break your heart but we don't need them in one piece. Quite the contrary. We're going to crunch them up. Got it? From the bone dust my company will make a new drug. - That will boost people's vitality. - What? That's nonsense. - Who would buy such a thing? - You little pain in the neck! You adorable little pain in the neck. Everyone. Everyone! The whole world. I will make millions out of this! Then we will have the life we always dreamed of. Sun, sea and pina coladas! Maybe you'll get lucky and a new tour group will come by and let you out. Oh, no. That was the last tour of the season. - I'm so sorry. - Adios! - You're such a strong woman! - Oh, you charmer! Over here, Becky. Three, two, one. Sorry about your foot. It's not so bad. I'm more worried about Professor Herzog. He has trouble with his heart. - How are you feeling? - I've been such a fool. I'm so sorry, children. Not a hope. The door is too solid to break down. At least we kept Marty out of here. Stay by the fire. There are lots of fierce animals out here. Marty! You gave us a scare. - Where are the children? - They decided to stay at the castle. Is everything all right? Yes, everything's all right. The others are fine. There has to be something here. We have to get out of here somehow. At least we have light. If it were dark in here, I'd lose my mind. Light... Maybe we could abseil down this cable. Forget it! Firstly, it doesn't look like it could bear the weight of any of us. Secondly, it's electrified. You probably meant that we can somehow cut off the electricity and then send the lightest one of us over kind of like in a cable car, right? You can forget it! I was actually thinking of... Timmy. Even if that works, I've never seen a dog unlock a door. Timmy's our only chance. - He has to go find Marty. - Okay, then. - Let's do this. - Okay. You're crazy. Sometimes. Julian, be careful. Please. Be careful. It's alright. Julian, watch out! - This thing seems to be stuck! - In any case, keep calm. Don't force it. That's dangerous. Hey, did you hear me? - The light's out. - The light's out! Julian, you can do it! Yeah! Oh my God, Julian! Becky, your jacket. So, Timmy, you've managed tougher stuff than this. - Here. - Okay, thanks. Fetch Marty. And be quick. - You can do it, Timmy. - Okay. How does it look, Becky? Will Timmy be able to do it? You can do it, Timmy. - Come on! - Timmy, you can do it! What a bummer! We need to get the rope swinging so it moves again. Be careful, George! Run, Timmy! How is he doing? Hey! What are you doing here? "Listen to your heart. It has its own language. The heart doesn't lie." They were just trying to protect me. "We need your help." Today is a lovely day to smash up a dinosaur skeleton. Right, Pedro? Every day is a lovely day with you, turtle dove. Okay. Marty? Take care of the professor. Becky, you said there's a radio. Call the police and send them to the cave. - What are you going to do? - We've something to do. Come on, Timmy. We have to think of something fast or they'll destroy the skeleton. We'll stop them doing that. It is a bit of a pity. - What's a bit of a pity? - That we're breaking it up. - It's very impressive. - Yes. But think about... what your reward will be. Hey, turtle clove, wait a moment. Let's take some photos! Come on, come on. - Pose like a supermodel. - The vain tart! Yes! That's good! And now give me a fierce look. You're so sexy! Now roar! Oh, you're really scaring me! I like it when you're ferocious. Very good. Wait, wait! Where did the light go? The generator! I'll take care of it. Don't bump your pretty head. Hola, companero! You're a big, fierce laddie, aren't you? Very nice! Pedro! Boy! My eyes hurt... You! His head probably hurts too. And now quick. Let's get to work. Pedro? What's up... Pedro... - What happened? - We happened. - The smart aleck. - The pain in the neck. You four think you can outsmart me? Hang on... Yes, we do. Well done. Great. A dog! And the kids? Dick! - I had to get something. - The police will be here soon. Get away. This isn't a playground. Speaking of... Don't worry. I have everything under control. "Perhaps one clay my son, Marty will be as proud of me as I have always been of him." It's not just some bones, but a whole dinosaur skeleton. Would it be possible to get a room together, please? A shared room? Good joke. You're going to jail. You can't share a room there. - But... turtle dove! - Be quiet! - Are you all right? - Yes. Well, then... We came as quick as we could after we got the call. Well, in any case... - It all turned out fine. - How's the professor? Fine. The doctor said he'll be back on his feet soon. But now I have to tell you something. Well, I... I would like to... Well, what I want to say is... Thank you. I mean... Truly. You're welcome. Well... Marty... So... I'm sorry I didn't believe you. I might have been a little harsh towards you. I apologize. My many years of experience in the field of palaeontology put me in the position to confirm that this skeleton is probably the best-preserved and most complete dinosaur skeleton ever found. The fact that we are able to present this spectacular find is all thanks to a most extraordinary person. Please welcome Marty Bach Junior! He's a great guy, Marty. I knew his father. A very fine fellow. Very. I'm Marty. I... I know I'm not like other people. And because I am the way I am some people laugh at me. But it doesn't matter what people think who have never taken the time to really get to know me. The only thing that matters is what the people think who are important to you. And that you listen to your heart. I would like to thank my friends without their help I wouldn't be here today and the dinosaur behind me would be destroyed. So I'd like to thank Julian, Anne and Dick, George and Timmy. Timmy is a dog. Thank you, for everything. There's just one more thing. Because this skeleton is likely to attract a good many tourists the city urgently requires someone to take over management. And, after discussing the matter with the mayor, I can't imagine a better candidate than you, my dear Marty. That is, if you want to do that. Yes, I do. This is much nicer than a wedding. Now they know you were right. Just imagine! The dinosaur is now called Tyrannosaurus Bachae. That basically means "Bach's Tyrannosaurus." Named for the man who discovered it. I mean you. Hey, Marty. We have to go. - Will I see you again? - I certainly hope so. Oh, by the way, we have a present for you. Go get it, Timmy. Go on... take a look. We all agreed that no one can look after a dog better than you. And Mayor Jacobi has no problem with you taking him to work. And wh... what is his name? I tried out a few names and somehow he responded best to "Dick". But of course it's your decision. Goodbye, Marty. Goodbye, Ms Fanny. Okay, pose for a photo, everyone. One... two... Activate your last reserves! Bada-bing! After discussing it with the mayor, I can't think of anyone... No, I just can't. 11-1, 3. Cameras A and B. Marinus, the map. Ron, got the mobile? Oh! Start again. Great! It was a dog! I saw it with my own eyes! Depends. Where's Aunt Fanny. Tell me she isn't... - lll? - My mouth is too full. Some caves are made when water under the earth's surface grad... gradually... grad... It is a bit... What are you doing? Where to now? Very funny, Walter. Cut! Thank you! - You! - And his head... That probably hurts too. Isn't it possible, Marty... I can't find the hole. Hang on. Sorry. A voice changer... Tschangis 320. Then Farty's mather was fight, and... Then Farty's mather was fight, and... Farty's ma...! I'll do it again. Voice changer... I... I'll wait inside... outside. I'm... I'm Timmy. Up there is the lappy... What? So... What next? Don't know yet.
