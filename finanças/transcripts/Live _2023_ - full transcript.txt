'Kochi, 2018' While co-passengers are saying that he might have alighted for some emergency, the police haven't taken it at face value. After questioning those who were present at the scene, the police have inferred that the incident is shrouded in total mystery. "Rains and fountains will shower embers" "Upon the waves and the shores" "Rains and fountains will shower embers" "Upon the waves and the shores" The police investigation is progressing, based on the possibility of an accident. Moreover, a higher police official stated that there are discrepancies among the statements of some of the co-passengers. CCTV footage from Kayamkulam, Mavelikkara and Chengannoor stations are being inspected. We shall come back with more details regarding this news. News Hour shall continue with "Live" updates. "Rains and fountains will shower embers" "Upon the waves and the shores" Today, our Government has acknowledged that our beloved Amala Ma'am is a brilliant doctor. And that's a fact known to every common man... who's dependent on our District Hospital, right? Anyway, for selecting Dr. Amala Sreeram as one of the best doctors in the state, here's a warm hug from 'Friends from Kochi' workers, to the Government and the Health Department. Everyone knows that Doctor joined us during the floods... when not just Kochi, but our entire state was neck-deep in water! I still remember. Doctor called us on a night when we were baffled like... we were witnessing the end of the world before our very eyes. She asked if she can join us. And you know how we are, right? From that day onwards, we took hold of her completely. And I think she was there with us day and night... for all the programmes of 'Friends from Kochi' during the floods. Doctor, we love you! I love you all too! But... enough of all these praises! I had told them that such an event is unnecessary. For such a success, is a party necessary? Is it? But the only relief is that... these two will bear the entire expense for tonight! So, eat to your heart's content without blinking your eyes... and rush to your homes and sleep well! Okay? Ma'am! A song, please! What is this? - Sing! - A song? Please, please! One song! - Come, sit here! - So that was your plan! "The day I set my eyes on a mirror, I didn't see my past" "Did my eyes shut from within, due to the scorching heartaches?" "The singing within" "Smeared all over" "Smeared all over" "The singing within" "The singing within" "Smeared all over" "Smeared all over" "The singing within" "Beside a memory that's leaving me without ever leaving me" "Are the eyes in a hurry to shed tears?" "On the small path that leads to the sea that overflows unknowingly" "Was death waiting around the corner, to erase the laughter?" "To disappear, to keep flowing" "To fly high" "The singing within" "Smeared all over" "Smeared all over" "The singing within" "Within the blink of an eye" "A season of compassion blossoms before me with kindness" "When the mind is dreaming" "The depth of time appears before me" "Tears are turning into a sea far away" "The rains and the fountains" "Are flowing away in sorrow" "Riches and foes" "Are turning into mere shadows" "Through this thread of water that has wounded everyone" "All of us have come together, with our hearts united" "The singing within" "Smeared all over" "Smeared all over" "The singing within" "The singing within" "Smeared all over" "Smeared all over" "The singing within" Come. It will be alright now. You will be alright now. There's nothing to worry. It will be alright now. Don't cry. Don't cry, dear. Don't cry. Yes, Nikhila. Hey, there's a casualty case. It's a 5-year-old child. She ripped her necklace and inserted a bead into her nose. Oh! It's quite serious. Can you come to the hospital quickly? Okay. I'll come right away. I'm starting now. - Tell me. - Hey, Nikhila. Make sure the child is stable. Remove your hand from your nose. Make sure that the bead doesn't enter the child's trachea. Okay. Make sure that she is sitting upright. Keep your head like this. Okay? And make sure, she's breathing through the mouth. Open your mouth and breathe through it. Okay. Okay, that's good. Okay. I'll be there shortly. I'm on the way. Come. How is she now? Did you check? Yeah. Now she's okay. But that bead's position seems to be a little risky. Is it? Okay. Let's get it checked. Hi, dear! How are you? - What's your name, dear? - Alli. Alli! It's such a cute name! It's nothing. It's very minor. She will be fine soon. Can you please wait outside for some time? Go. Your mom and sister are scaredy-cats! We can handle this ourselves, right? You are a good girl. Give Doctor Aunty a hug! Now Dr. Archana will give you a tight hug. Come. Sit back. Hold her tight. What's your favorite cartoon character? Mr. Bean. Mr. Bean is my favorite too! Do you know what Mr. Bean said? That lil' Alli has hidden a bead! But where has she hidden it? Oh no! It's inside her nose! Give me the forceps. Don't move. Okay, dear? Then, Mr. Bean told me... to remove it from Alli's nose. Come, let's find it. Come on, come on. Okay. Come. This is the bead, Aunty. You know what would have happened if it had entered her trachea, right? It would be best to supervise a child of her age while she's playing. Okay? There's no problem now. There will be a minor bleeding. After you reach home, keep her head in an elevated position. She will be alright soon. She is a smart child. She cooperated very well. Right, dear? Here you go! - Thank you, Doctor! - Of course! Bye! Bye. Good night. Bye. Oh God! - This is from a new number! - Yes. Should we file another complaint with the Cyber Cell? There's no point! Let me see who it is. Let me try calling Sreeram. 'There is no urgency. Thanks' I'm leaving. I'll see you tomorrow. Okay, okay. Okay. Bye. Who is going to Bangalore tomorrow? It's me, Sir. You don't have to go. Send Sreekumar. - You go to Trivandrum tomorrow. - Okay. Call me by noon and let me know what the actual issue is, over there. - Okay? - Okay, Sir. 'My love might be bugging you' 'My love might be annoying you' 'But I will continue to love you, since my love is my right' 'barrage of creepy, flirtatious messages' 'But I will continue to love you, since my love is my right' 'Did my love annoy you?' Hello? Hello! Talk to me if you dare! Hello! - Understood? - Hello. Hi. Hi. - You're talking about Qatar, right? - Yes. Hey, he's talking about what happened in Qatar. That's what happened. That's not what happened. She was working in Qatar airways, right? So, when this movie was being shot in Qatar, she went to the location to play the role of a gynaecologist. That's how this relationship actually began. I was also saying the same. Hey, they must have seen each other at the shooting location, right? - Of course. - That's all there is! Us, being Malayalis... The moment we hear 'extra marital affair', we want to link some movie folks! We feel good when we do so! Check out the glow on this guy's face! Hey Joyce! Show it to us before you leave. Please show it to us before you leave. You're never going to see it! Show it to us before you leave! Joyce! Sreeram! Dude, please show it! Get lost! - I just want to see it. - Bye, bye! Hey Sree! I don't want it, Sir. - Send it to him. - Yes. I'm sure. He won't send it. I'm sure. He won't send it. Joyce, it's definitely her! Almost every night, after sharp 11:00 p.m. messages start flooding my phone's inbox, inquiring about my well-being! 'Have you gone to bed, Doctor? Have you slept?' I even get inappropriate marriage proposals. Like, how cheap...! Please! I request you to... please please... Can you drive faster? It's not possible to change my number. I've been using this number for the past 10 years. Why should I change it? Sree... That ADGP is your friend, right? Can you talk to him? Please. No. This is something that you can solve yourself if you really want to. Solve it? How? I didn't understand. You are a Doctor. A paediatrician who's quite good at what you do. Then why are you making YouTube videos at midnight? I make YouTube videos at midnight... since I don't have time during the day! What's wrong with that? Have you seen the comments below your videos? I post informative content that's very helpful to ordinary people in my videos. If people post vulgar comments below that, why should I care about it? That's not it. You are really enjoying all that. That's all! Don't decorate it with your justification, Amala! There's nothing wrong. And this headache is due to sinusitis. There's nothing to worry. Okay? No need for any medicine. Do steam inhalation regularly. Reduce the fan speed at night. Are you relieved now? This is the man who invented the word 'tension'! Especially in her case. No need to get stressed. Okay, Sir. Thank you! Okay. Thank you, Doctor! - Listen, dear. - Yes. The sale of the plot in Thalayolaparambu is more or less finalized. That money, along with the bank loan... will be enough to pay for her college admission. We can look into the rest when the time comes, right? But she has to agree to it, right? I don't want to become a Doctor by paying for my admission. I had told this to Grandpa earlier as well. Just give me a year's time. I will secure a seat on merit itself. See? She can do it, Kuruvacha. You just have to give her some time. But you should utilize the time that you get, very well. You shouldn't over think and give her a headache, Kuruvacha! Right, dear? He never understands. He just keeps repeating himself. It's like that. Anna, I've kept aside 3-4 books for you. Okay? I'll send them along with your grandpa. Okay. Are you going home now, Kuruvacha? No, I'm on duty. You're on duty? Okay. - See you later then. - Okay then. Let's go,dear. This time, we don't need famous models. Any college student would do. But she should be beautiful. Or else, it will be a disaster. - That's a good idea. - Okay. My God! What is this? So many curries? Is this all you do at home? It's not me. It's my Mom! Cooking is my Mom's main entertainment. And since she learned how to watch YouTube now, she experiments after watching the videos on it. Great! What is this? Do you still have all these? Didn't get tired of it? It's for Anna. - The two of you are very close, right? - Yes. This attachment is not just for me. It's the same for everyone from our batch. This Kuruvachan addresses everyone like his children, and nothing else! He is such a loving person. Long ago, while I was staying in hostel during my 1st year in college, I was down with severe pneumonia. Moreover, I was very homesick. Then, Kuruvachan and his daughter... I mean, Anna's mother... The love and affection with which they cared for me... That care... I can never forget that, Nikhila. Where is Anna's mother now? Anna's mother was a teacher. She was married off to Kozhikode. But her husband was working at a private bank in Kottayam. One day, Anna and her parents took the Madras Mail train... to attend a wedding in Kozhikode. When the train reached Kadalundi, the railway bridge collapsed! Three carriages fell into the river. Including Anna's parents, 57 people were killed in that accident that day! Oh no! 5-year-old Anna survived, somehow. I'm telling you... She's a miracle child! Check this out. This was the next day's front page news... with Anna's photo. 'Kadalundi train accident: 5 year old girl brought to the shore by rescue workers' Strange, right? Such is life! Not bad. But we need better girls, right? - Right, Dilip? - Of course, Sir. Campus to ramp is not a privilege, right? The model should look gorgeous to the public. That's all. There's a girl I know. Just a minute. I took him to the room in the morning itself. Okay then. You can leave. Yes, Sree. Amala. There's a driver at your hospital, right? What was his name? Kuru... Kuruvachan. Yes. He has a grand-daughter, right? The one who came to our apartment? - Yes. Anna. - Anna. Yes, yes. Can you send me a photo of Anna? What for? You prepare a detailed complaint, as per Manoj Sir's instruction. Let's file it tomorrow itself. Sreeram will find out, right away. The two of them are very close, Jerin. Amala, no girl without a proper stand, can live peacefully in this society. You should have a stand about everything. You should definitely have it. Don't you remember... that Malaysian trip while I was the news editor at the TV channel? Yes, I remember. I casually posted a photo of me lying on the beach wearing a short dress, on Facebook, just for fun. And what a mess it became! My parents had a problem. My husband had a problem. I lost my job the next week! Oh God! Finally, what happened? On the anniversary of my resignation, my husband and I went back to the same beach. This time, I wore a bikini and posted another pic of myself hugging my husband! And a poem along with it. 'Guys, 19th century was better than the 21st.' 'Isn't it heroic to strip away the bodice and pay tax instead of wearing one decreed by boomers?' The thing is very sensitive. - Basically... - Last time the anesthesia... Last time... - Doctor. - Yeah. You continue going. I'll join you later. Alright. 'Hi. Have you slept, Doctor?' 'Send a pic. I want to see you.' 'The customer you're trying to reach...' We are planning to shoot the ad for the Trivandrum showroom, with some college girls. In that case, wouldn't Anna be a good fit for it? If that happens, it would be a help for them, right? No. No chance. I don't think she will be interested. Why are you acting like a guardian to her? If she does an advertisement and it clicks, wouldn't it be beneficial in her life? You have no idea what you're saying! She is studying very well with a goal in her mind. I don't think she'll be interested in any of this. Try to find some other girl. The way you talk has been really irritating, lately. Hey, dear! Oh! She won't listen when I tell her not to enter the kitchen in the morning! What should I do with this girl? - Yes, dear. - Hi, Kuruvacha. I'm going to Coimbatore urgently. Sree's grandfather passed away! Okay. You know why I called? On the way to the hospital tomorrow morning, please stop by my flat. I have given a cover to the security guard over there. Please collect it and give it to Dr. Cyriac tomorrow morning itself. Of course. I will do it. Is Anna with you? - Please pass the phone to her. - Okay. Dear! Yes! Here you go. It's Dr. Amala. - Yes, Doctor. - Anna. I have sent an email with an attached document. Please print it and give it to your grandpa. Okay. I'll give it to him. Oh no! Didn't you take a shower? I'll come back and take a shower. We need to find a new house, Grandpa. Someplace closer to the town. The town is just 10 minutes away, right? - Yeah, right! - What? We have to walk 2 kilometers to catch a bus. Uncle Saji drops us here only because he'd get other trips from here. Moreover, I don't like this house. It's a house with zero positive energy. Okay. Let's do it after we sell that plot. We will find a way. Your mother also wanted to leave this place. Though it was all water and swamp, if I call her to Marykutty Amma's house, she would step out right away! Mathukutty had the same opinion too. He wanted to buy a property in Vypin. Yes, Grandpa. It got late by the time the class got over. I'll call you after I board the bus. I'm on the way. Okay. Stop there! Catch them! Hey! Catch them! Hey! - What did I do? - Get inside! - Let go of me! - I didn't do anything! Get inside! - What's the matter? - Get inside! Sit over there! - Move aside! Catch them. - Get everyone inside! Get them inside! - Catch them! - Get them inside! Get in! Let's go. 'Grandpa calling' What do you have to say, Madam? What do you have to say about this raid, Madam? Excuse me. Does that girl have anything to say? - Go! - Move aside! - Do you have anything to say? - Move aside! Don't disturb us. Let them inside! What is this? Move aside! Go! Go fast! Don't disturb us. The police conducted a raid based on Mandaram TV's report that... prostitution gangs and drug rackets were operating... using college students in the city. The gang was operating from a luxurious house.... in a colony where many of the city's VIPs reside. The initial conclusion made by the police is that all the girls... who were arrested are students from several colleges in the city. We are yet to receive more information in this regard. Kuruvachetta. Come. Let's go to the station. Come, Chetta. Come, Chetta. Babu sir? Are you at the station? There's a small problem. You will be there, right? Move aside! Move over there! Check those bags. Keep it there. Hey, move over there! Hey, move! Why are you reluctant? What is your name? Hey, what is your name? - Anna. - What? Anna. I was returning from coaching class, Sir. What coaching class? Parents work tirelessly and send you to study. But you hook up with someone and... Sir, we got these from their bags! Oh! So is this also yours? Is it? Give me your bag! Let me check it. Check it properly. Hey, check her! Fast! Get her to the hospital! Fast! What is this? Move aside! What is happening here? Move aside! Move! What is happening here? - Sir... - What is this? Take her to the hospital instead of playing around! Get these people outside! Get them outside! Get out! - What is the case? - Immoral trafficking, Sir. Shadow police confirmed it. We made the arrest after that. Come here, Sreejith. Get their statements. Get her checked by someone from the clinic. It shouldn't become a nuisance later on. Hey girl! Dear! - Hey! - Hello! - Hello? - Hey! According to the police, drug sales and immoral trafficking... have been taking place for an extended period of time... in these luxurious houses rented by Perumbavoor resident Sajimon. What is this? Can't you guys do your job if there are no reporters and cameras around? Who is giving you your salary? Is it the government... or the TV channels? These things can't be allowed here. The gang was operating using college students... Oh! What an enthusiasm! You have told them everything, huh? Now we can prepare the FIR report after watching the channels! When will you all mend your ways? Sir! Let me tell you one thing clearly. The way you work along with reporters and TV channels... I won't allow it in my station! All of you will be in trouble! I'm warning you! Sir, the girl who went unconscious is not part of this gang. Then? None of them know this girl. She was waiting for the bus after her entrance coaching class. By mistake, we... Shucks! ...many agents were working for Saji, Who is that? ... in this prostitution business.... I asked you, who is that? - CPO Sumathi. - Call her! Sir. What is this? You will be suspended, for sure! This girl is innocent. But the whole world is seeing her face! It's only because of you! Dear! Grandpa! I didn't do anything, Grandpa! That girl's grandfather is here, Sir. What all have you done? I am answerable for all this! If this becomes an issue, that officer will sit at home! That's for sure. Call him. Chetta, Sir is calling you. Come. Please sit down. Can I get you something to drink, Uncle? No. During the raid, a struggle broke out near the bus stop. We took this girl from there by mistake. We haven't registered any case. When we realised it, we asked to release her immediately. You got stressed for some time, right? Das, drop them to their house in our vehicle. That's not required, Sir. I came in an auto rickshaw. We will go back in it. Just think that it missed the eye and hit the eyebrow instead! She has God's blessing. That's why the Police realized the truth. Or else, we would've been forced to go to great lengths to prove our innocence. I had always suspected her. I have told you, right? Ask them when they arrive. I knew it earlier itself. I let it slide since he is very gentle and well-mannered. What gentle and well-mannered? Shameless people! You should ask them to leave in the morning itself! This item can't be allowed to stay here. Throw her out of that house. Are there any new videos of yours? We can't allow this here. You should leave this place. Move away! Shoving the phone on the face? Move away! Move! Get lost! Move! The Police admitted that they made a mistake. We saw you on TV. [booing] Stop booing! Move aside! Move away! It's nothing. It's nothing. Tomorrow morning, everyone will realize the truth. Don't cry, dear. Don't cry. Get lost! Yeah. I'm just getting in. Thank you, Sir! What happened, Rahim? Did you get the minister's news byte? No, Sir. They are waiting over there. Even now? - Send Jiji over. - I'll call her, Sir. Roy Sir. Our boys are waiting over there. We sent them because the minister called us. Not possible at night. He is going to meet the CM, right? It's difficult to do it over there. Just remind him. Thank you. - Sir. - What is this? Is it NASA's satellite image? This is that girl's raid case, right? Yes, Sir. It's the same visuals on all channels! Same scrolls! We haven't gotten any side stories. Sir, I had called and informed Rahul. That Circle Inspector is a troublesome guy. He is not cooperating. This girl... - Lal? - He is in his cabin. - Over there? - Yes. Sir. Show me the visuals of that raid. Give me that laptop. Who is this? This is... Anna. - Anna? - Yes. - Only Anna? - Yes. Do you have any other details? No, we don't have any other details. Hello. I had called you many times, Sir. I'm really busy here. It's okay, Sir. I called you for something, Sir. The girls who were arrested in the raid... Is there any way to collect their names and details? Is this for telecasting on your channel? No, Sir. This is not for telecasting. Things are messed up over here. The C.I. is really furious! I can't do anything for the next two days. I will call you back later. Okay, Sir. - Come, Lal. - Okay, Sir. - Is Dasettan over there? - He will be there, Sir. Hello! Dasetta, 2010... Get me the news files till January 15th. Your eyesight is diminishing! The file that you are looking for might be in here. There! 2010, January. Kozhikode. State School Youth Festival. Individual champion. There she is! Anna Chirayath. Bharatanatyam, Mohiniyattam, Kuchipudi, Mono-act, Story Telling. A-Grade in everything! Dasetta, please mail these to Jiji. I'll send an email. The 'Kalaprathibha' and 'Kalathilakam' titles were cancelled after 2010. After that, the participants with the highest points... became 'Individual Champions'. It was the first State Youth Festival that I reported. That's why I remember it so well. - Sit down. - Sir. Collins. 2010 State School Youth Festival, held in Kozhikode. Back then, I got you the details of a girl named Anna. Do you remember? Yes. Director Rammohan had asked me to get it. Yeah. Which film was it for? 'Honey Drops'. Okay, thank you. Anna... Chirayath. A film star who rose to fame from the Youth Festival stage, Anna... Chirayath... arrested in a Police raid. It was through Director Rammohan's film... that Anna entered the film industry. Now, this has... a side story. You can go live! Okay, Sir. Thank you. Shouldn't we confirm it once again, Sir? What's there to confirm? Whether this is the same girl... At the station, what did you hear that the girl's name was? - Anna. - Anna! Anna Chirayath! It's her. I'm sure of it. Don't worry. Go on! - Okay, Sir. - Okay. Anna Chirayath! Former 'Kalathilakam' and film star, Anna Chirayath arrested for immoral trafficking. It was Anna Chirayath who was the topper in... 2010 Kozhikode Kerala Youth Festival, winning the highest number of A-Grades. After that, she debuted as a heroine in "Honey Drops', a film directed by Rammohan, the famous Director. Even though several offers came to Anna after the success of her first film, Anna decided to quit films and pursue her studies to become a Doctor. An intelligent girl who was a role model for the society... got trapped in the hands of drug mafia and pimps. This is a topic which should be discussed with much importance by our society. 'In the arrest of sex rocket-' 'Operated in a rented house in the city Anna Chirayath is in the arrested list' 'Police takes Women's Association to custody in Kochi' Hello. Good morning. No, no. We just landed. No. I haven't checked Facebook. What's the matter? Is it? Let me check. Okay. 'Drug sales and prostitution ring in Kochi's rented house' 'Former 'Kalathilakam' and film actress Anna Chirayath arrested' 'Drug sales and prostitution ring in Kochi's rented house' Was she a film actress? This girl. 'Drug sales and prostitution ring in Kochi's rented house.' 'Former 'Kalathilakam' and film actress Anna Chirayath arrested' Nikhila, what is this? No, no. I just landed now. Okay then. Let me see. I just came to know that this girl was a film actress! Just because she played a small role in a film a long time back, does that make her a film actress? That's enough, right? When I asked her photo for that ad, what all were you bragging? 'She is at a different level.' 'She has a different aim.' - Was this her aim? - Sree...! - Great aim! - Enough! Please stop! Take a right turn from here. Okay, stop. Where are you running off to? I need to go to the office. You have the keys to our flat, right? You can order food online. There's nothing else, right? - Give it. - Look at this. Film actress and former 'Kalathilakam' Anna Chirayath arrested for prostitution. My God! The news focusing on Anna broke out on Mandaram Channel first. And then, on their online portal as well. By late night, it spread like wildfire on all the online channels. I've been calling you since then. Film actress to serve drugs. When did all this happen, Nikhila? All in one night! Anna, you look so tired after crying all this while! Do you know what I believe? There is still some justice and law left in this country. You just wait and see! Media, police... and especially that Mandaram Channel. They will definitely have to come to court to answer for this! Be strong. Drink some water. Yes, Krishna. Tell me. Amala, you know Sama's Aunty, right? Devika Aunty, who works at Bharata Mata College. Oh, yes. Devika teacher. Sama is staying with her now, right? Her only daughter is in Bangalore. Sama is saying that she will shift to the ground floor. So, Anna and her Dad can stay there, right? You do this. Try to shift them to that place today itself. Thank you! Okay. I will update you. Bye. A house has been arranged. Let's shift today itself. What is the situation outside? Should we call the police station once again? Okay. Let go of my hand! What do you have to say? Move! Can't see her! Move away! Move away! Hey, move! Close the window! Move! Hey, move! Move, move! Move! - Don't beat reporters! - Which newspaper are you from? - Online! - Which online channel? Hi Machan vlog, Irumpanam! Go away! Everyone go away! Get lost! This is definitely police's mistake. But you know they won't admit it. Anyway, the C.I. is not available today. Let's go and meet him tomorrow. It was Lal from Mandaram Channel, who reported this. He didn't do the follow-up story on his own. All of these are SJV's work. SJV? Well, you are yet to see that havoc! This is the only news that's going around online now. What all are they writing? Shucks! What is a way to block this? Mandaram is the mouthpiece of Malayalam, right? They are the ones who made it so worse, right? This will end only if they confess the truth. But the possibility of that happening is unlikely. But anyway, we can try. It's not about trying, Jerin. We have to make them rectify this. Or else, the shame will be on us. Or else, what meaning do our lives have? True. Jerin! Jerin! Here! Can you serve the food to them? What is the update? The channels haven't stopped yet. Some of them have just started weaving new stories. I contacted the police station. It was their blunder, for sure. But they won't accept it easily, right? We are going to the police station tomorrow. Okay. Anyway, I have asked Kuruvachan not to give the phone to her, for the time being. If she opens it, she will collapse! This is so cruel! It takes just half a second to get trapped. I'll take the plates out. - I will also come, Teacher. - Okay. "This is life" "This is why it's full of joy" "And that's a lie" "This is life" "This is why it's full of joy" "And that's a lie" "I was a little girl" "With a big smile and big eyes" "Big as the sky" "Big dreams, big dreams" "Medicine, medicine" "This is life" "This is why it's full of joy" "And that's a lie" "This is life" "This is why it's full of joy" "And that's a lie" Our dream doctor with our dream girl. Oh God! - Hey. - Yes. Just show up for the function and leave immediately. Uncle came here and invited you as well, right? It's not possible at all today, Sree. I'll call Uncle and tell him. I have to go to the C.I.'s office along with Jerin in the morning. I have to meet many people today to address Anna's issue. Anna's issue! Are you all so jobless, that you're getting involved in these shady cases? Sree, this is a problem affecting the life of a poor girl from an ordinary house. Do you know what a huge trap she is in now? I've known Anna and Kuruvachan for so many years. And they need my help now. Shady case, it seems. What's the matter with you people? The two of you are saying the truth. Absolutely right! There is no doubt that the police have made a mistake. Our internal body is investigating that as well. Action will be taken against the responsible individuals. Definitely! But I can't say all this in front of the media. Actually, I spoke openly about all this because... I'm extremely sad about that girl's situation. There's no point in discussing this between us, right? Due to a false news, that girl is unable to leave her house. There should be some solution for this, right? That's true. But actually, it was Mandaram Channel, that made such a mess of it. What was the need for them to dig up that girl's history and make a news out of it? Madam, don't think that I'm accusing you. Today's media is very wrong. Who gave them permission to publish a news article... using the photo of a girl upon whom no cases were charged? I am the station officer here. They should have called and asked me at least, right? Is this what journalism is? That's how it is now, Sir. I'll give you some simple mathematics. We publish a fake news. So, the affected person would definitely go to court. Then, we will hire a big shot lawyer and fight the case. We'd most likely be acquitted in the case. If not, we would pay a meager fine. That's it. If the money we can make from publishing this fake news... is ten times more than what we would spend for this court case, why should we ignore that fake news? This was the question that my editor asked me before I put my resignation. Sir, we really appreciate that you're trying to cooperate with us. Anyway, we are going to meet the editor of Mandaram. Our primary requirement is to make them publish a retraction, right? If we require anything, we will call you, Sir. You know what really happened, right Sir? Sir, can you please... just talk to them? I'll tell them. But not through the phone. I'll do it in person. Or else, he will record that as well, and turn that into a news! - Hi Jerin. - Hi. What can we do now? You tell us. Look, by today evening... news regarding this retraction should come... on Mandaram channel, newspaper and online portal. There's no other solution for this. Also, it's a grave mistake from your side. Can you deny that? It was Mandaram that started this. You guys should come forward and resolve this. I wrote about it in great detail on my online channel. But its reach is very limited. You are right... but you should talk to Sir about this, directly. There's no use in discussing this with anyone else. Okay. I will talk to Sir right away. Hi Jerin. You should have walked right in! What's the need of such formalities? Is this... Hey, please sit. You presented it to him as a big issue, as if he is a 'big' guy over here! No, SJV. I just mentioned it to him when I saw him. That's all. And of course, you will be busy with your paper, channel... You know how busy it gets, right? So many news items are coming in. From that, we have to pick what we need. That's how we're busy. This is Dr. Amala. I know. Dr. Amala Sreeram. Paediatric Surgeon at Ernakulam Government hospital, right? Yes. - You were working in Thrissur earlier? - Yes. I'm a big fan of you, Doctor. Actually, my wife is your fan. She watches all your episodes without fail. She has a doubt as well. Achaya, how does... She calls me 'Achaya'. Achaya, how does the doctor precisely describe... the health issue you are facing in the very next episode? That's purely coincidental. This is a question from 3.5 million subscribers! - Excuse me, Sir. - Yeah. Jiji, please stay. Let's get down to business. Lal told me about it. Almost all news media reported about that day's raid. But it was our media... that found a special story in it. But in that story... There are no factual mistakes in that story. But there was a twist in its climax. And it was completely unexpected, right? But Mr. SJV... you do realize... that twist... has made a girl's life pathetic, right? Yeah. That I know. I'm not disputing that. - Jiji. - Sir. In the 7 p.m. bulletin of Mandaram online and Mandaram Daily, Anna Chirayath's... news should be corrected. Okay, Sir. We will close this with an apology... saying that we received wrong information from the police. - Right, Lal? - Yes. Hereafter, at least try to get a clear picture in such cases before you... Is it okay now, Ma'am? Sounds reassuring. Yeah. Yeah. - Draft it real quick and send it to me. - Okay, Sir. Then, Rahim from the online department... Tell him to call me. So, yeah. Jerin, Doctor... you can come over any time. We will be with you. Thank you. Hey... your hand was sweaty when you arrived. It's not sweaty anymore! Yeah. Thank you! Hey, what about the news? It will start now. Welcome to 7 PM News. First, we have the headlines. Kerala, under the grasp of fever. There are no medicines in Government Hospitals. The state is in deep trouble. Chief Minister said that the Government will agree to the demands of the fishing community, except halting the Vizhinjam project. [other news continues] Did anything come in the news? Nothing so far. They will be saying it later. Recklessness on the front page and apology on the last page! That's how it is, right? Sit, Kuruvachan. Actually, they were afraid about what you would say. Anyway, we did the right thing, Sir. After all, it was a mistake from our side, right? What? Mistake from whose side? Hey, who reported the immoral trafficking? Who sent the visuals? Before reporting such a thing, whose responsibility was it to confirm it with the police station? Elsewhere, you would be sitting at home for this single reason! We won't do that. Incidents reach here at the speed of light. Those are converted to news at an even greater speed. That's our only concern. There is no need to get emotionally attached. Understood? People won't remember these things. They keep on flying from one news to the next news and then to the next. What about the retraction, Sir? [Other news playing] Retraction!! This company has a credibility. It has my name on the byline and I have a credibility! If I say tomorrow that the news I created was incorrect and apologize for it myself, who will continue to watch our news? News bulletin is ending now. Over to 'Public Forum' with Abhilash. Namaste. What was that? Where is the news, Jerin? Wait. Let me check. Look! 5 million followers! This happened in a single day and night. How? If we publish the story of an 'ordinary' Anna Chirayath... will this happen? No. So, the news about 'film actress' Anna Chirayath... can make such things happen! We should sing a hymn in her name, right? Cheer up, man! Amala! He won't correct it. What? He won't stop with this! 'Anna Chirayath with Amala Sreeram, the social media star' He started his new game. Anna Chirayath with... Dr. Amala Sreeram, the social media star? This was posted at 7.05 p.m.! It's a warning, Amala! I shouldn't have trusted him. - I didn't do anything! - Get inside! What's your name? I don't know. That SJV says one thing and does something else! Hey, Anna! You slept very well, right? What happened? Did they say anything in the news? Come here. Come. They didn't say it. There's no point in hoping that they would confess their mistake now. Let's move forward, our own way. Anna, you should listen carefully to what I'm about to tell you now. You are a highly educated girl. You are intelligent as well. If someone says something that you never even imagined to your face, you should be able to ask them to get lost! We should be giving her the courage to say that! And... From now on, we shouldn't hide anything from her. News articles that appear online, on TV and the press... She should see all the information that comes up, connected to this issue. Instead, how long can we live within the moral codes, created by the media and society, and die of suffocation? Yes, that's true. From today onwards, you should show some more courage. - Okay? - Yeah. Hey, the entrance exam is fast approaching. You should attend classes. You should study. When the rank list is published, you will be there in the top 50. This is my prediction. Be good to your servant while I live, that I may obey your word. Open my eyes that I may see wonderful things in your law. I am a stranger on earth; do not hide your commands from me. Yes, teacher. - When? - What? Okay. We are meeting the lawyer tomorrow itself. We have to think seriously about our next step, right? We will drop by tomorrow. Okay? Bye. What happened? Two youngsters came on a motorbike, holding a camera. They took a photo as well. When teacher stepped outside to check, they went away. So irritating! Our media and society are changing so fast! You know something? I never read the comments below the videos I post on Facebook. - Who has the time for it, right? - Yeah. Today, when I posted about Anna, I just casually looked through the comments. You won't believe it. 99% 99% of people... is interested to prove that what she did was wrong! I don't understand what's plaguing their minds! They don't even care about the truth. In between all this stress, I forgot to change my clothes. I posted a video wearing this. So many disgusting comments came below that video! I don't know. Is it only women who have this fate in this world? Amala, let me tell you a quote by Rebecca West. 'People call me a feminist... wherever I express sentiments... that distinguish me from a doormat.' I've heard that one. She said this about 40 years ago. There is no change in that even today. It's not going to change tomorrow as well. But in between this, we have to live our lives and show them! That's heroism. Heroinism! Okay. Don't forget the meeting with the lawyer tomorrow. - But Amala... - Yes. Just remember. You're going to fight a big media house. Especially with a wormwood like SJV! I've been doing some research about him. I asked around and got to know some things. The story of how Samkutty Vakathanam became SJV is... quite interesting! 'Mandaram' 1986-87 period. It was the blooming time for Mandaram weekly magazine in Kottayam. Are you resting your butt on the magazine? Hey! - Did the vehicle to Kozhikode leave? - Yes, Sir. It left. Okay. Sir, this is the guy whom Father Vakathanam told you about. Okay. - What is your name? - Samkutty. - Till which grade did you study? - I've passed 10th grade. Passed 10th grade. Do you read Mandaram? I read only Mandaram. Apart from that, I read the Bible. Kuriyapi, get him on that vehicle going to Idukki. Okay? I've told him. Okay? Samkutty, are you there? Yes. Say something while you're at it. I need to know whether you're in the jeep or fell off on the road. [Singing an old Malayalam song] Send the 15th chapter of 'Vannathikkili' novel for printing. What were you saying? I was saying that we should thank Father Vakathanam. He sent such a nice fellow to us. - Our Samkutty. - Okay. He is so humble! He is so God-fearing! That's good, anyway. I'm on leave for three days from Monday onwards, right? Shall we send Samkutty himself with the Idukki vehicle? But does he know how to drive? That's the surprise! He has a driving license even for heavy duty vehicles. What? Is that true? Then, send him. Send Maniyappan also if he needs company. Okay? Place it over there. Hey Maniya. Go somewhere and read this. Go and read! I can do this alone. Sir. Yes. What is it? Why does this vehicle going to Idukki... need two workers? A single person can load this... and drive the vehicle too. So, two workers are not required? No. I will drive the vehicle and do this too. Hey! From now on, only one person is required... in the vehicle for newspaper distribution. It's not granite that you are transporting, right? It's paper bundles, right? Only one person is required for that. Those who came as helpers... can go and do manual labour at the construction site, if they want. Those who are not willing to do it can go home. [Singing an old Malayalam song] Four days after his daughter's wedding, Kuriyappi returned to Mandaram. My keys, Chetta. Boss has asked you to go and meet him. What? Boss! Take care of them, read Mandaram, pray everyday... Samkutty is here, right? You get going. Samkutty Vakathanam started his triumphant journey... by betraying Kuriyappi, the one who got him a job at Mandaram, on his fourth day at work itself. - Going home, brother? - Shall I drop you? Go drop Pathalam Varkey, your Dad! You blood sucking vampire! Pathalam Varkey? With that smile on his face, Samkutty continued his Idukki trip with Mandaram's weekly bundle. He would begin his journey at night, and in the morning, after unloading each bundle at its designated location, he would start his return journey to Kottayam. Around this time, women working in hospitals, government offices, textile shops... around Ponkunnam, Kanjirappally and Kottayam... would be standing at bus stops waiting for the Idukki-Kottayam Super Fast bus. He would give them a lift. Only to them! During those trips, Samkutty would talk to them endlessly. He would strike a friendship with them. He'd ask them things happening at their homes, their towns and their work places. They would tell Samkutty their stories... filled with sadness, happiness, tears and hopes. Samkutty would store those stories in his mind like a photocopy. During nights, sitting in the press, the dispatch unit or the terrace of the magazine building, Samkutty would write these stories as series of news articles. The tear filled stories of women living in hillside towns! Hey. Was it really you who wrote this? - Yes. - Tell me the truth. I swear, Sir. Okay. How many chapters of this do you have? I've written only four or five chapters. I can write as many as you want. You write as much as you can. Next week, we are going to give an advertisement for this. And we will start the series, the following week! - What about the 'Vannathikkili' story? - We are stopping it next week! Hey, this is 'Sad stories from Painavu'. Give it to the artist to prepare the advertisement. Another thing... We need Samkutty's photo as well. Okay? Come here, Sam. Hey, nobody else has anything that can beat this! Our 'Mandaram' will grow like wildfire! Got it? From then on, Samkutty's life changed completely. The series started. It became a hit. Within just 6 weeks, Mandaram weekly's circulation went up from 10 lakhs to 15 lakhs! Driver Samkutty became Mandaram weekly's Idukki reporter. In 1995, Mandaram started their newspaper division. Sam was appointed as the newspaper's news editor. You know how Mandaram newspaper is, right? Sam blurred the boundaries between tear-filled soap operas and the news! He remodelled news in such a way that truth and lies became indistinguishable. Malayalis started devouring Mandaram! Mandaram newspaper's circulation went up from Lakhs to Crores! News editor Samkutty became the Chief Editor. By 2001, Mandaram initiated plans to start a TV channel. Uthuppachan Sir's sons were educated abroad. They said something openly to their father. Hey Samkutty, my sons are saying that the chief editor should not be appointed... based on old acquaintances! Moreover, they will appoint a senior journalist. He will conduct interviews and decide on the person. Okay? I agreed to it. Samkutty had the ability to crack almost any interview. The boss knew this more than anyone else! Well, one last question. During Mandaram TV's launch, imagine that an earth shattering breaking news is required. We have only 3 days. What can you do? I'll search for one till I get it. What if you don't get one? I will create one. I will definitely create one! Thus, Samkutty Vakathanam took over as the supreme soul of Mandaram TV! He modified his name according to numerology as well. He changed it to Sam John Vakathanam. Sir had appeared for two defamation cases against Mandaram for publishing fake news. But what happened at the end? SJV influenced the petitioners and made them withdraw the cases. That's his experience. That's what Sir hinted at. That won't happen in my case anyway. Well, I was just saying. You do this. Prepare all the documents Sir asked for. - I'll send someone to collect them. - Okay. - Okay, bye. - Bye. Nikhila, let's go to the coaching center. Anna, you wait here. Let me meet the principal and talk to him first. You can come when I call you. Okay? Let Kuruvachan also join us, right? Yes. Come. What is it, dear? You forgot what we told you, is it? Be brave. Stay here. Hey, I'll call you back! - Hey! This is that girl, right? - Who? That Anna! - Anna Chirayath? - Yes. Call the others. It's her, for sure! Come! Come. Doctor, I respect you. But the outside world is not aware of whatever you told me now. If it's a mistake by the police, they should say it publicly, right? It should come on some channel or newspaper seen by the people, right? And you mentioned an online magazine, right? How many people see it? Anyway, our coaching center's name hasn't come out in public yet. But some rumours have started spreading. That maybe the reason why many parents are calling us. In any case, we have to protect the dignity of our institution, right Doctor? Sir, we can understand your situation. That girl is suffering so much for no fault of hers. Do you know how much this man has been toiling for her studies? Personally, all of us have only good opinions about Anna. Actually, this news has left us all very confused. What really happened? What is the reality? We don't know that, right? But we know her, right? Few people like us who support her... know the reality very clearly. We are trying to make you realize that! Now I realize, it's not going to be an easy task. Anyway, thanks for your time. Amala Ma'am, please say a few words! Amala Ma'am, please say a few words! Please say a few words about this issue! We are curious to know what had happened to Anna Chirayath. Please say a few words for our 123 Online Portal! Whatever I say, you publish news as you like, right? Will Anna Chirayath be able to continue her studies, Madam? Please say a few words! Please, Madam! Please say a few words for 123 Online Portal! Please don't go, Madam! Just two words, Madam! Hey! Start the motorbike! Let's go! Move aside! Move! Move aside, brother! Guys, we are right behind their vehicle! We are about to reach near their vehicle! We're giving you an exclusively report! The reason Anna Chirayath got expelled from the coaching center... was her unruly relationship with the drug mafia. We are right behind their vehicle! Guys, we can clearly see that her Dad is also inside. Hey Anna! We can see Anna hiding her face! We have to find out where they are going! We are in Panampilly Nagar, to be exact. We are right behind them! Hey, it's a traffic block! Move, move! One minute, Guys! Look, look! Amala Sreeram is here. Anna is here. We can see them clearly. We can clearly see that her Dad is worried. The exclusive thing to find out is... the relationship between Anna Chirayath and Amala Sreeram! Whatever it is, 123 Portal will report that exclusively for you! Guys, please don't forget to subscribe to our channel! Such risky reporting... Hey! We've run out of petrol! Somehow we managed to escape from those channel guys! Some online channels had called Aunty as well. This is how our world is! We can't expect anything less than this. The court case will move ahead properly. But we must hold on, until the court verdict comes out. Hey! Don't get stressed thinking about your exam. Even if no one else is there, you have Nikhila and me, right? We will give you the best coaching. We only have an approximate idea about where we are. I think they are somewhere here nearby. - Hey! This is the same red car! - Call the other media guys! Quick! Call them now! Guys, we are now right in front of the house... where Anna Chirayath, the controversial girl stays. We can clearly see Anna Chirayath inside! We also see Amala Sreeram! Guys, we are going to give you an important hot news! Cine artist Krishnaprabha is also here! We need to find out why she is here! Other media reporters are arriving just now! But we were the one to arrive here first! 123 Online Portal! Don't push! Move aside! What are you talking inside, Madam? - Move aside! - Run, run! My mobile! Guys, we are being beaten up like dogs! Please don't beat me! My mobile! Please don't beat me, sister! Please don't beat me! Please support 123 Online Portal! Please don't beat me! 'What's the role of social media star Amala Sreeram' 'and film artist Krishnaprabha in this case?' 'Is Amala Sreeram getting involved to get more social media attention?' 'You will be surprised to know how Amala Sreeram and Anna Chirayath are related!' 'Doctor's hooliganism on the streets' 'Is film artist Krishnaprabha part of the sex racket?' I can't even switch on my phone now. It's you and your gang's clamoring everywhere! Anna Chirayath and Amala Sreeram getting united! You are not just a Doctor now. You are a 'Social media star'! If all the media in the world is reporting such news about that girl, there will be some fact in it. Without realizing that, you went behind it and now... they made a brand out of your name! Are you seeing any of it? And you have the perfect friends too! Pathetic! Phew! Who am I talking to? Hello. What? Yes, I'll come now. Where are you going? Teacher... We are leaving. Because of me and my daughter, I know how much you all are suffering. I will call Amala and her friends. I don't have any clue in my mind as to where we are going. God will show us some way. "The cloud" "The sky" "A flickering flame" "Wandering all over the earth" "A fire scorches the soul" "You are a ripple that flutters on the waves of dreams" "Why are you sad?"

Please don't be mad at us. I got worried seeing the problems you all had to face because of me. That's why I forced Grandpa. Sorry. We are in Kanyakumari right now. There's an Aunty here, who's a distant relative of Grandpa. When the news came on TV and problems piled up, it was Aunty who asked us to come here. When we left Teacher's home, we didn't know where to go. That's why we came here. Aunty has a beauty parlor here in Nagarcoil. She told me that she would get me a job over there. Then, the entrance exam... I will write it, Doctor. When I mentioned it to Aunty, she said she will get me some time to study. I will call you tomorrow or the day after. Please don't be angry at us. 'The number you're calling is currently switched off. Please...' Jerin. Yes, Amala. I'm about to leave for Trivandrum. Jerin, they are in Kanyakumari. What? Anna and Kuruvachan are in Kanyakumari. Anna had sent a voice note on WhatsApp. Really? Thank God! You said you're leaving for Trivandrum now, right? Yes. I had told you that I'm attending Journalist Union's State conference, right? Are you coming? We can go meet Anna. That's what I'm also thinking. Okay. Anna said that she will call tomorrow. Shall I plan after that call? - Okay. - Okay then. "Fiery clouds are showering on the soul" "Your teary words are flooding the waves" "The paths of embers are diverging" "The sweet tunes of lullabies are spreading all over" "Fire will spread all over the streets" Yes, Sir. Thank you. Minister will be late. If I don't leave from here now, I won't reach Trivandrum on time. Those two questions that we planned to ask him... Ask him those. It's not related to this event. But ask him anyway. Oh no! Are you leaving, Sir? Minister will be a little late. I've told everything to Lal and Jiji. They will manage it well. But it won't be the same as you being here. Just 5 minutes, Sir. Please! State Union conference is being held in Trivandrum. I've never been to that event. SJV Sir is leaving. That's good, right? Let him leave. Let the new Kerala be cleaner! Yes, I have to leave early. One second. - Yes, Jerin. - Hello. Hey, can you hear me? - Hello? - One second. I can hear you now. Tell me. Did Anna or Kuruvachan contact you? No. Actually, she told me that she will call me after two days. But she hasn't called me yet. When I tried calling them, both their phones are switched off. You should listen carefully to what I'm about to say now. A news has come on Mandaram Online just now. Did you see it? No. Obviously, I'm here. I didn't see it. There's a video of Daisy and a woman leaving in an auto rickshaw... from that Daisy's beauty parlor you told me about. There's a news posted along with it. One second. Hold the line. 'Controversial girl Anna Chirayath in Daisy's? She has upped her game!' What is this? Daisy's is not a good institution. I spoke to Roy, a reporter at Nagarcoil. They have this massage parlour and they are into some other sort of things. Oh God! Poor thing! They wouldn't have realized all this. We have to contact Anna as soon as possible. I've asked Roy to trace her. Didn't you say that Daisy's house is in Kanyakumari? Yes. Can you come to Trivandrum tomorrow morning? Or will Sreeram create an issue? Sreeram is in Ponmudi right now. Let me try to catch Vanchinad express and get there. Okay? - Okay. - Okay then. Bye. Shit! - Hello. - Hey. They are no more! What? Anna and Kuruvachan have committed suicide! What? I have a couple of meetings here, tomorrow. Or else we could have gone together. Call Sreeram. He had asked you to call him once the funeral is over, right? Roy is going to Trivandrum. He will drop you at the railway station. 'Kerala Journalist Union - 57th State conference' Though both of them were going through hell, the reason behind this sudden suicide is Mandaram online. There is no doubt about it! After that news came out on Mandaram, all online channels were scrambling over there! Everyone must be happy now! - Can you drop me there? - Okay. The reason for the crisis faced by Malayalam's mainstream media... is the lack of believability! The time when people used to believe what they saw... on the newspapers and on TV as the truth, has ended! Make sure that your news doesn't adversely affect... the life of even a single person among the helpless ordinary folks. Then, they will come seeking you. They will listen to you. Or else, they will forget you and your news! Go and search the truth in the news. Speak only the truth! You should once again remember... the old word 'Ethical Journalism' that has become extinct now! 'Blowing their whistles,' What was the rest? 'They crossed mountains and shattered silence'! Who's buying Sprite? You'll see my true colours if you tell me later that you didn't get it. Get in, get in! 'Kerala Journalist Union - 57th State conference Chief Guest - Sam John Vakathanam' It was a great conference. He made some excuses. You are drunk! Drunk? I'll be standing on my two legs even if I'm drunk! Hey! Are you not going to booze? Have you stopped boozing? We aren't supposed to booze inside trains. But we can do anything, right? We can do anything! - Yeah! - Pour me a double large. Hey, are you not going to booze? Have a drink! The case of Madhu from Attappadi. No other media in Kerala handled that case like Mandaram! Do you know that? I, myself... did two news series on it, personally. Women, children, tribals. If there's any issue related to any of them, Mandaram will pounce on it! SJV, recite the 'Kattalan' [forest dweller] poem! Paying homage to dear friend Madhu, I present 'Kattalan' by Kadammanitta. "With watery eyes like that of a tigress after giving birth" "With curved eyebrows like the tail sprouting out of a black cobra" "The forest dweller stands in the middle of the burning forest" "The forest dweller stands with a burning torch pierced in his chest" - Wow! Great! - Super! Long ago, I recited 'Puthen Pana' loudly like this and... It's 1:00 a.m., SJV! - I'm going to sleep. - What is this? I thought all you guys would stay up and we'll have fun. That's why I boarded this damn train! And now, halfway through the party, everyone crashed! - Good night! - Good night. Good night! Good night. "...like the tail sprouting out of a black cobra" Hello. Jerin? Hello. I'm unable to reach Amala on the phone. At what time are you guys starting from there? Amala has left! It was Roy who dropped her at the station. Is that so? Okay, okay. Thank you, Jerin. Okay. I had been calling you since Trivandrum. Why didn't you answer my calls? I didn't see your calls. I even messaged you that I haven't brought the car... and that we can return together by train. And I came to know that you were in the train, when I called Jerin. I have a bad headache. I'm going to sleep for some time. Renowned journalist and Mandaram TV chief editor, Sam John Vakathanam alias SJV... has gone missing during a train journey. Sam John, who was traveling along with his friends... after Journalist Union's State conference... They have testified to the Police that... Samkutty's bag, phone and other belongings were found at his seat. The police have started a vigorous investigation along with RPF, focusing on the railway stations between Kollam and Ernakulam. Why are you sitting like this? I saw you just now, Doctor! Where are you coming from? Trivandrum? - Yes. - Are you alone? Our State conference is going on in Trivandrum, right? Actually, though I came by car, I thought I will return by train. I've shuttled quite a lot on this route long back during my reporting days. So, thought I'll rekindle some of that nostalgia while travelling. Why were you in Trivandrum, Doctor? There was a death. Not one, but two! Oh! Any relative? You know them. Anna Chirayath and her grandfather committed suicide. Oh! Yes, yes. I heard about it. The bureau had informed me during the conference. It's really sad! So pathetic! She was a girl with a bright future. She could have studied further to reach a good position, just like she wished. But she had to go act in that movie unnecessarily in between all that. Aargh! So what? She acted in just one movie, right? What happened to her because of that? I know how far you are involved in that girl's case. But that does not change the facts. What fact? I know this Anna Chirayath really well. I've known her since she was 5 years old! Do you know that? Doesn't matter! Have you seen her between the ages of 14 and 23? The age when a woman shows all her true qualities and traits. Ram Mohan, who made that movie with her... The director... He is my friend. Friend as in... We do all sorts of nonsense together! Partner in crime! I can even say that he is my teacher when it comes to women! Sorry. Well, I know that I don't have to apologise to you. When someone gets trapped in your aura, they can never lie! So, what I was saying was that... Ram Mohan! When Ram Mohan cast her, I was the one he called first. I was the one who gave him her contact details. If you inquire about this Ram Mohan in the industry, you will know, Doctor. He keeps casting newcomers as heroines in all his movies. What for? Huh? No girl will leave his movie set without sleeping with him! So, Anna would also have... Aargh! He must have screwed her, for sure! Doctor, you and your friends... tried your best to protect her. Didn't you? By confining her within your veils. Yet, she destroyed that cage and where did she fly to? Daisy's beauty parlour! Do you know what this Daisy's beauty parlour is, Doctor? It's a first class whorehouse! And this Anna Chirayath... She is not Saint Anna Chirayath, unlike what you claim. She is a first class whore! Hey! Doctor, are you okay? You have something to tell me, Doctor! This Samkutty Vakathanam never studied journalism. But I've studied the minds of people. Especially, that of women! And it was using that tool, that I was able to run Mandaram until now and reach this stature. The first time I saw you... was in 2015. At Thrissur. It was Indian Medical Association's national seminar. You had cropped your hair... and you were wearing a red saree! Phew! Do you remember? But I remember. Ever since, I've been after you, Doctor! Every public function that you attended, seminars, camps... I'd be there at all those places. I wonder whether Sreeram realizes all this. If I was a poet, by now... I would have written an epic poem! That's how beautiful you are, Doctor! You look so ravishing! My paths leading to Dr. Amala Sreeram... These pictures bear witness to those paths! Is this... Is this your number? This is one of my numbers! Now it's your turn, Doctor. You wanted to tell me something, right? It's an old story. A father, mother and child were travelling by train to Kozhikode. When the train reached a similar bridge, the bridge collapsed. Three carriages fell into the river. 57 people, including that child's parents died! Only two people survived. And one of them was you! And the other one was a little girl. Don't you want to know the name of that little girl? Anna Chirayath! Really? Is it true? This has the scope for a huge news item! Yes. This is the news. This should be the news! Sam John Vakathanam's body has been recovered from Pamba river near Chengannur. The initial inference by the police is that... it was a natural death caused by falling from the train. Vinu is joining us with further details. Smitha, as you said, the mystery continues. Sam John Vakathanam's body has been found. The other procedures are progressing. A police team including DySp George Varghese and two Circle Inspectors... have been examining CCTV footage for the past two hours. The DGP has ordered an immediate inquiry at every station from Kollam to Ernakulam. 'Have you slept, Doctor?' 'No' 'It's really late. Why haven't you gone to sleep yet?' 'I'm not feeling sleepy' 'Me too' 'You looked stunning in that sleeveless dress you wore on your Facebook Live' 'What are you wearing right now?' 'Is it possible to meet you, Doctor?' 'Shall I come there?' 'No! Where are you?' 'I'm outside your apartment' 'I'm at the bridge' 'Oh! I'll come there' 'Really?' 'I'm coming right away!' Two individuals who miraculously survived... the train accident at Kadalundi river that happened in 2001. 5-year-old Anna Chirayath and Sam John, who was a youngster back then. That accident occurred while Sam John was working as Mandaram's Kozhikode bureau chief. Later, it was through Sam John's interview.... that Anna Chirayath entered the film industry. Now, on the night after Anna Chirayath and her grandfather's suicide, Sam John, the media genius, has left us, in a similar train accident.
