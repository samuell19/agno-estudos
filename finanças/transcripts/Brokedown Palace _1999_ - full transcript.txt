They've scheduled the hearing for the Burmese. - Where are you going? - They should have a copy. You're crazy. It's pouring out there. I know. I'm not sure where to start. You're probably fast-forwarding already. I mean we shouldn't be here. We're from Ohio. A dinky little town called Upland. I'm Alice Marano. My best friend forever is Darlene Davis. - I don't know about Hawaii anymore. - What? It's like a bunch of tourists on family vacations. We met as babies, we crawled to each across the neighbor's lawn. At least that's what my mom used to say. Please get a little closer to your sister. Teachers always said that I was the bad one, Darlene was good one. We didn't care. It was a joke to us. We knew how we were. It was always the two of us. Doug, could you take a picture of me and Alice? Sure. Darlene was going away to college in the fall, so... we decided to have one knockout trip together. Celebrate our sorrows, you know. Cause after that... it was going to be the first time in our lives we weren't gong to be together. It had to be amazing. Memorable. Hawaii seemed so middle-class. Like our parents ' version of fun. I wanted it to be special. Not that she would ever forget me. Then someone mentioned Thailand. It was as simple as that. Strange how its always the little things that make big things happen. Ferg told us that his brother spent the whole summer in Bangkok for less than $500. Later on I learned that Thailand means freedom. What could be better than a country named after the exact thing we were looking for. - I thought you wanted to go. - I do, you know. It's my dad. - You're so afraid of him. Look, he's already being a dick about my off-campus apartment. Whatta you think he's going to say when I say "Oh, did I say Maui, I'm sorry, I meant Bangkok." - What'd you tell your dad? I told him you were going to go and he never gave it a second thought Not that he thinks twice about anything anyway... not as long as I still have my exciting career. Just don't tell your dad. Let him think we're still going to Hawaii. I mean it's only 11 days. How's he gonna find out? Dar was worrying about lying to her dad for the first nine hours of the flight. By the 24th hour, she was too tired to care. It took forever to find the hotel. Funny what forever used to feel like. This is it? It doesn't look very royal. How much royal do you want for $6 a night? Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. What is it? It's a huge roach! Thais have so much respect for their monarch... that up until Rama llI changed the law... no one was even allowed to utter His Majesty's name. The act of buying and then releasing captive animals... was also considered meritorious. A number of vendors around Bangkok sell birds for this purpose. Its hot. Enough with this heat. Exactly. I'm tempted to just jump in the river. How bad can raw sewage be? They dump human waste, bathe and drink, all in one river. Give me that geek book. Tell me you brought a bathing suit. - But I'm not going in there. - Come here. What if we're caught? No one thinks here, Just walk in like you own the place. Welcome to first class. Something to eat or drink please? uh yeah, two of those, please. What room number? - We'll just pay cash. - 414. Oh come on. They don't care. Lotion. Thank you. That's me. I'm gonna be her. I'm her divorce lawyer. I want both houses, the Jag, and the nanny. Ah, you've gotta have a Nanny. Of course, I mean the girls are crazy about Helga. You know what, let's make him pay. Damn right. Exactly. You say room number 414? 414? That man number 414. I was sure... Oh, it's 416. I'm sorry. You stay this hotel? Of course, our room's up there. What's your name? I'll find your room number. You know, this is really inappropriate. Our room... It's right up there. What's your name? Room 333. Bloody hell, I can't take you two anywhere. Sorry, mate. It's been a bit of a blur of hotel rooms. - Cheers. - Thank you. I've got to shoot through. You're scared straight now, right? Excuse me. - We'll pay you back. - No worries, it's fine. - Can we get you a drink or something? - It's the least we could do. Okay. I'll take it for the wanker in 333 who left his key in the men's room. Come on. But the man said it was solid wood. What? Oh, great. Don't worry about me. You're in the fake Rolex capital of the world. - Some look better than the real ones. - So you're new in town. - Where are you from originally? - Australia. Actually I haven't been down there in ages. The software company I do seminars for, they fly me all over Asia. I do bugger all most days. Getting paid to sun-bake. I'd kill for a gig like that. Quick, eat rice. It makes it go away. Eat more. It's like, it feels like your mouth's gonna explode. You okay? Nobody's laughing. Come on. Have some more. - You forgot your drink. - I've had enough. Beautiful night, isn't it? Yeah. Is this okay? Are you okay with it? Why would I care? He's cute. Go for it. Take notes. I want details. I didn't know if you had keys. - Where are you going? - To the market. Coming? No, I've gotta get some sleep. Sure. Okay. - He wants to take us to Hong Kong. - Us? Yeah. Just for the weekend. He has to go on business and... Alice, it was great. And weird. And intense. I don't want to go to Hong Kong. It's just for a day or two. The flight's only a couple hours. I though we were gonna go to the beaches? Please? I really like this guy. Then go. I'm not mad. But I'm not going. You go. And have a great and weird, and safe time. How many times have I done shit like this for you? Please? Okay, Dar. I'll have the black one. It's nice. It suits you. That is, did Darlene tell you about Hong Kong? Ah yeah, she might have. Okay, well here's the drill. I'm gonna flly this afternoon. Then you two guys can come out there tomorrow. I'll get all my business done... then we can just kick back have a good time. It will be unreal. Come on. I want you to come. Look, I've made the ultimate sacrifice here. One first-class ticket cashed in for three economy. You have no idea what you've ultimately sacrificed. I'll get it. How much? What did you get? You were gone so long. I got you something. It's beautiful. Thank you. Thank you for coming to Hong Kong. They said on CNN that it's gonna be pouring in Hong Kong. You still sure you wanna go? We'll buy umbrellas. My top got all wet. Alice, can you hurry, we're gonna be late. - Does this look okay? Yeah, Perfect. I'll see you downstairs, okay. - Okay? - Okay, okay, okay! - Who is it? - It's Manat. I have a bag? Oh uh, okay. Just give me a minute. Thank you. - What have you been doing? - I had to brush my hair. Excuse me. We're gonna be late. Shit. They're already boarding. Sorry. Alice! - Where are we going? Alice. - I don't know. I'm an American citizen. May I please telephone the American Embassy? - Darlene! - Where are you taking us? Who gave you the narcotics? - I want to see an attorney. - It was your girlfriend's idea? I am an American citizen. I have the right to an attorney. Ah yes. And right to one telephone call too. Excuse me. Excuse me? I have to go to the bathroom. Please, take me to the bathroom. You sign. This is in Thai. I don't speak Thai. I can't sign this. You sign. I don't speak your language. Darlene Davis? I'm Chief Detective Jagkrit. Have you been here all day? Yeah. The bathroom is down the hall. Please. - Why were you going to Hong Kong? - Just for fun. You okay? No. No, Darlene, I am... I am definitely not okay. Come on, we can't fall apart now. Someone's gonna come for us. - What make you think anyone even knows we're here? - The embassy knows. The detective called before. Yeah...sure he did. Then he called the president. They try and drive you nuts. "You Sign. You sign. Your girlfriend confessed to crime. " - They told you I confessed? - They told me you signed a bullshit confession. Like we're retarted. Like we're going to sign something we can't read. You didn't sign anything, did you? It was my statement... ...saying we were innocent. Was it in English or Thai? Was it in English or Thai? Look, if they change what I said, then I'll tell them. Clearly, I can't read Thai. I'll just tell them it's not what I said. I'm sorry Alice. I'm just...I'm just not used to being tossed into some filthy, disgusting jail. Is that what you think? You're gonna make this all my fault? Is that what you think? You were the one carrying the bag. Yeah. The bag you packed it. Well you were the last one alone with it. Okay, so we're innocent. So there's nothing to worry about. Once my dad gets to hear about this... He'll know what to do. Hello? Hello, Mr Davis? Yeah. Sorry. I think you've got the wrong Mr. Davis. My daughter's off in Hawaii. Alice Marano. Marano. Yes. They were arrested in the afternoon... I'm sorry, but it appears there is no Nick Parks. But I went to his hotel. The Queen Victoria Hotel. We sent someone. The only Parks registered as far back as three months. Nor is there a plane reservation in his name. No Nick Parks. But that's impossible. Check again. We're quite thorough actually, and of course we'll keep at it. At this point, I must advise you to consult with an attorney. I'm sorry. If you repent, plead guilty, ask for the court's mercy... ...the judge will be lenient. Give you no more than 40 years. But I'm not guilty! But are you prove that. If you plead not guilty and don't prove... you get life sentence. It's just until the trial. You wash. Dar, come on. I wasn't even that scared at first. I'd had worse haircuts. And I actually believed that if we could just hold on until the trial, it would all be over soon. like a nightmare. See, I didn't know then that it was all rigged here. Like those birds in the market place that you think you're setting free. While all the time they're trained to fly right back to their cages. Because that's all freedom is. An illusion. Waiter, there's a bug in my snot. The fruit looks okay, though. You like? Go take. Thanks a lot. Kneel down and lie. Like a priest. Maker. But she said it was... Come on. Do it facing down. Make it super-size. She said we could get some fruit. You have to earn the food. You can not just take it. Well how do you earn it? Put in your time girl. Take one of those. I was so high, I didn't notice my bloddy visa had run out. I couldn't pay the friggin' fine. So this bloke I hook up...He tells me he'll pay the fine and give me some pocket money. And all I gotta do is take these packets and stuff them up inside me. And let me guess... You're telling that smack-in-the-box tale again? Yankee girl. - What's the deal with her? She just thinks you're fun to piss off. To give her a good show. Get her a new long job at the brokedown palace. - When's checkout time? That's all I want to know. - Check out anytime, man. You find freedom here and in here... ...and in here. - What's up with her? - She thought she'd get pardoned. Everybody thinks they'll get a pardon from the crown. Makes me sick. Addicted to fantasy. That road leads straight into the ground. It happened at least once. The old mama-san... ...she was here one day and gone the next. - The guards were in a proper lather too. - What happened? Nobody knows. We think a certain guard opened the gate, and she just walks away. Which guard was it? Velie. We think Velie. So someone bribed Velie? With what? I heard it was $100 US, for the gate and a car waiting outside. Nix please with these bedtime stories. If they catch you escaping they add 15 years to your sentence. That ol Mama-san could have been shot out there in the street. All this talking is a big waste of time. If I was you, I'd get in touch with Yankee Hank. - Who? - Yankee Hank. - He's a barrister. And that's stretchin' a ton. - Yankee Hank's a damn good lawyer. If he's so good, how come you never called him yourself? What young ... going with an impoverished soul like myself? He like American folding money girl. You're not lying. Of course, if I had the dosh, I'd try Velie first. Dad! I'm so sorry. What? I'm sorry I lied about Hawaii. Honey, it's all right. We're gonna get you out of here. Don't you worry. okay? Whatever it takes. Tell everyone I didn't do it. - What? - We didn't do it! They know that. Everybody knows that, baby. Everybody back home. They miss you, sweetie. - Why would you ever want to come here anyway? - I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Honey that's all right. It's all right. We'll find a way, okay? Everything is gonna work out, I promise. All right. It'll be okay. I love you. He's going to get us out. He's getting us out. - Us? He said us? - Yeah, he wants to see you. You always thought you were so smart. I hope you're proud of yourself. - Mr. Davis... - You're a schemer. You're a manipulator. And you think that I don't know you? You are dead wrong. The only thing that has ever come out of your mouth is lies. Six years old, the paint. The paint all over your hands, all over our couch. "I didn't do it." 16 years old, the beer cans in my car. "I didn't do it. " Let me hear you say it again Alice. Come on. Let me hear you say it in here. Uh? Come on, for old times' sake. I didn't do it! I'm so glad he's finally here. He's being so great about it. A cool thing about my dad is really knows how to grease the wheels. He'll figure out a way of getting us out. - What's the matter? - Nothing. - Why aren't you excited? - I am. I am. Till you talked to Father? Damn it! You like? Good fish heads. No! It's a matter of days now. I told the detective the truth. I told him about Nick Parks and all the events leading up to our arrest. and I signed a statement... assuming that it was just a Thai translation of what I said. But these aren't my words. I never said anything that was in that statement. That's the truth. - What happened? - Don't give up all hope. We still have an appeal. And after a while, you can request a pardon from the crown. He found you both guilty. - For how long? - Good news. I was afraid it would be life. You both got numbered sentence. - For how long? - 33 years. Honey, don't worry, okay. I'm going to take care of everything. Yes, we're all over it. Listen, I gotta go. Sorry about that. Couldn't be helped. - Mr. Davis, I know how you must feel. - Fellas, look, look... I know what goes on around here. Spare me the lip service. The Thais take drug smuggling very seriously. - There's no doubt about that... - Yeah yeah, yeah Come on. Nobody here really wants to stop the drugs. They're all... Look. I don't give a damn if this country drowns in heroin, okay. That's their business. Your business is to help American citizens, now... She didn't do anything. They're not gonna make some kind of example out of my little girl... ...with some trumped-up charge. You folks pull strings all the time. If you wanted to, you could pull them for my daughter. Mr. Davis. The DEA will continue our investigation. If we find any evidence of this alleged young man who lured your daughter into this... ...well sir, we'll certainly introduce that into an appeal. I know this is difficult for you sir. But the best thing that you can do for your daugher right now, is to go home. Okay? Go back to your family. We're not going to let anyghing fall through the cracks here. We'll keep you well informed, okay? That's a promise. So here we are. Just two more drug smugglers. I don't even know why I'm making this tape. How do you do? I'm Henry Greene. Hank Greene, actually. - Who are you? - Yankee Hank? Yankee Hank, or Hank the Yank, or whatever. What can I do for you? You want a cigarette? - So you're like a lawyer? - I'm not like a lawyer Sweetheart, I am a lawyer. Is this pro bono work that your firm does? Pro bono? No. So I listened to your narrative. Forgive me if I'm blunt, but there's nothing there. You just claim you didn't know about the smack in the backpack. Which, if you're lying... makes you brainy and stupid. If you're telling the truth, then you're just stupid, so... I gotta ask you a couple questions. Who was carrying, the luggage, the carry on thing with the drugs? I was. Okay. So you had a couple kilos of heroin in there. You didn't notice any extra weight? - I didn't. I mean, I dont know. I just didn't. - We were late. Yeah, of course you were. - Who packed the bag? - I did. Okay. Alice, what's your father do? Works at Bekins. - Does he run a branch office, or a frahchise manager? - No. he rents trucks. And your mom. She work? She died when I was 7. Sorry to hear about that. What happened? Car accident. - what your dad? - He works in insurance. And my mom sells real estate. Part-time. Okay. I'm gonna give them a call, and were going to see if they wouldn't care to contribute... ...to their daughters' liberation fund. - What exactly are you gonna do? - I'm gonna try to get you both out of here. What I want you to do is start writing letters to various lawmakers back home. Congressmen. The president. A priest. You know a priest. That'd be good. You want me to write to my congressman? That's right. I'll be in touch, girls. - Well he's totally sleazy. - Don't say that Darlene. What kind of a name is Greene? You say you're Thai? Well, I might as well be Thai. I'm an American, but I know the Thai justice system. - Now there's an oxymoron. - Yeah. My wife, Yon, is also a practicing attorney... born here in Bangkok. We've helped a lot of families in your position. And we could help your daughter. What is it you want out of this, Mr. Green? I'm just a broker. We're looking for our usual retainer. Which is... $15,000. $15,000? $7500 to try to get a hearing and $7500 if we do. That's for both girls. Wait, wait. For both girls? - Now Darlene needs her own trial. - No. I don't think you really want to do that Sir. I mean one of the strongest points in your daughter's case is the fact that Alice didn't sign that confession. So if you separate them, you'd be begging for Darlene to be singled out. Mr. Davis. Do you wanna take a day or two? No. No no no. I'll work out the money. I'll get with Marano and... well, I'll wire it to you. Great. All right Mr. Davis, We'll be in touch. Who laid these tickets on you? Same guy who introduced me to these babies. Well, hello there. Thank you. Our next Royal Minister of Justice. Come on buddy, he's worked hard for it. He's working his fingers to the bone. I love that guy! I love that guy, man! This is great. No problem. When are you going to give me the police file on Davis and Marano? Those girls have absolutely no chance of getting out of there. You know that. You wanna tell me about Nick Parks? Who? Why couldn't you find him? The cops say the girls made him up. Let's just say we did find him, right? And he did plant the six keys on them, you know he'd never confess. - Six keys? - Yeah. They had the shit in their backpacks when they stoped them in the airport. As far as the Thais are concerned, they're guilty. Guilty or not, they're guilty. Take a pass on this one, bud. After you give me the file, Roy. Why didn't the police try and find out who bought the plane tickets? You'd think that'd be the easiest way to catch this guy. If he exists. He sure doesn't exist in this. What do you believe? I believe that, no matter what... we'll be able to afford a new car. Thanks to these girls. This is Jagkrit's trophy photo, right? Look at that, these guys are so arrogant, they don't even bother to finesse it. All that narcotic in that little backpack. I don't think so. - That's great. - It's just a hearing for a retrial. I also talked to the lady who runs the Royal Garden Guest House. Either she's not involved or she's the best liar I've ever met. What about Nick? Parks isn't the magic bullet. Even if we do find him, it's still your word against his. But we're still looking. So Darlene, I need a moment with Alice. Sure. Nick was staying at the Queen Victoria Hotel, right? My wife Yon, she went ther and found a maid who confirms... there was a young foreigner staying there who seemed to match your description of Parks. So, good, right? The maid remembered him with an American girl. But when Yon showed them this picture... ...guess who the maid picked out as the girl he was with. Me. Okay, I was at Nick's hotel. And he came on to me, but I told him to forget it. He was too sleazy. He never mentioned anything about drugs though. I swear it. - Is there anything else I should know? - No. Do you have to tell this to Darlene? 'cause, that would be really weird. - I see no reason to tell anyone. - Thank you. Now I've got a favor I gotta ask you. I haven't gotten your father's check. So... I need you to talk to him. Hi, hello. Hi. Alice? Are you okay? Where are you? You sound so close. I'm still here in Thailand. I'm trying to plan a trip. I would have been there sooner, but... It ain't about money or nothing, but the doc says my diabetes is... I don't have much time. I'm here with that lawyer, Hank Greene. He needs his money. He says he's got us a new hearing. Yeah, I know, I talked to Doug about it. And I got your money. Daddy. Do you think I did it? Oh, jeez, sweetie... Do you think I did it, Daddy? That don't matter to me. I don't care about that. Do you think I'd do that to Darlene? Oh, jeez, Alice... Don't beat yourself up about it. Nobody's perfect. - I gotta go, Daddy. Bye. - Wait. - It'll be here tomorrow. - Good. Thanks. Who are they? Refugees. The government wants them sent back to Burma. But we fight to keep them here. I think you are lucky today. You have a more lenient judge. - That's good. - That's very good. Here we go. Our pro bono work is good for the firm's image. Right, honey? Right. Some firm, you and me. - I get it. You're a closet do-gooder. - That's right Babe, I'm a closet saint. Just you watch me. He wants the prosecutor to bring in the yellow backpack. He says the backpack was inadvertently, unwittingly destroyed. Would you care to demonstrate how six kilos... ...that's 13 pounds of powder... ...can fit in here? He doesn't get it. This backpack is from the same manufacturer as the girl's. Identical in every way. If prosecutor and police can lie about the amount of drugs involved... ...how can this sacred court trust anything else they say? The charges should be dismissed, and these innocent, young American girls... ...must be freed. He is going to address the judge privately. You room 414? That man room 414. They know you snuck into the Royal Orient hotel and tried to put your drinks on somebody else's tab. - So? What does that prove? - It proves that you stole and you lied. All of you is on trial here, and this court will consider anything... ...that will prove that you are person of low character, capable of being a drug smuggler. Oh, that's such bullshit. Alice. We lost. This trial's a joke. - Alice! A shitty third-world joke. - We just proved that the cops and the prosecutor are totally corrupt, and the judge didn't give a shit. - Alice, get in the van. Oh, guess what? Our evidence disappears! Oh wow, what a big surprise! In the van! Alice, Thailand is your country now. Do you honestly think it's going to go better for you if you start pissing on them. You got paid. What do you care? I don't. What?! You have to keep working for us! You're on your own now. You think the president of the United States gives a shit about us? You're kidding me, right? What? Do you think getting stoned right now is a good idea? Yeah, it's an excellent idea, a terrific idea. Besides, if my brain wasn't on drugs I'd possibly kill someone. But you heard what Hank said, every single thing we do in here... We've got no more money. Hank's not coming back. Even if we could find a way to pay him, he can't do dick in this shithole country. Hank the wank. - So we're done with Marano and Davis? - Yeah. Okay. Because if we were still working on it, I think I've got something. These six women were on the same flight with Alice and Darlene. All eight tickets were paid for with the same stolen credit card. He had other couriers on that flight. It wasn't in the file. - Was it in the file? - No. Who was the customs supervisor on duty that night? This woman, Beth Ann Gardener, arrived in Hong Kong. Her suitcase arrived too, but it sat in baggage claim for 8 hours. She never claimed it. - I wonder why? - I have her address. So which member of the firm is going to Hong Kong? Charlie, did you forget your key? Yeah. - Beth Ann? - No! I'm not cops, I'm not President, I'm not immigration, and I'm not embassy. I'm a private defense attorney for some Americans in Thailand. And? I'd like to ask you a couple questions. Try to help my clients, two young women like yourself... who may have been victimized by the same person you had dealings with. What's your name? Henry Greene. Hank. Well, like I told the gentleman from customs here... it wasn't my suitcase. I didn't try to bring anything in. Somebody must have been trying to mess me up. Only thing I know is the guy bought me a ticket to HK. How was I supposed to know he used a stolen credit card. So go arrest him. - Nick Parks? - Whoever. - Are we done? - No. I thought I'd wait here for Charlie to come back with your wake-up dose... ...and snitch you both off to the Chinese. Or we can tell me about Nick Parks. I don't know what you're talking about, but... ...I may have heard stories about situations like this. And how does it happen in these situations? From what I understand, he looks for suckers. He comes on all nice and open. I mean... when you're with him... ...if there's 100 people in the room, it doesn't matter. All he sees is you. That's how this person gets the girl to trust him. Yes. Then, he... He starts asking her things. "Wouldn't it be great to live in a chalet in Switzerland?" "Get married in Paris?" By the time he pops the real question, you haven't answered no in so long, that you don't want to disappoint him. That's what I've heard, okay? You'll never find him, he's too smart. Maybe. What's his name? Nick something, you told me. Now please, leave. His name. Hello, Darlene. Great, does this mean you're working for us again? I don't know, maybe. Does the name Skip Carn mean anything? Look, I'm tired, I gotta tell you, I had a lousy flight back from Hong Kong. Where I met another one of Nick's, or Skip's, or whoever's girlfriends. - So come on, be straight with me. - What are you talking about? You've been playing me all along. Haven't you? At first I thought it was Alice, but then I realized the romantic come-on wouldn't work with her. - But it worked with you, didn't it? - No. You fit the mold, Darlene. I'm telling you, he's done it a hundred times. - And you're just 101. - Look, you're wrong. Okay, he wined you, he dined you, he made love with you. And then what? Asked you if you wanted to spend the rest of your life with him? No, he never asked me that. He never talked about what a kick it would be to get married in Paris? - What you'd do with a million bucks? - Well, yeah, he did ask me that. He asked me something about that, but look, he never asked me...I never knew. Who was it then Darlene? Was it Alice? No, Alice was never even alone with him. Look, what do you want from me? You want me to say I knew? Okay fine, I knew. I planned the entire thing myself. I'm the mastermind and the Kingpin. Is that what you want. Does that make it easier for you to walk away? So I don't care what you think. I don't care what anybody thinks. I know I didn't do it. Darlene. Darlene! - You. - What? You did it, didn't you? - What? - The questions. Nick's questions. "What would you do if you had all the money in the world? Where would you go if you could travel anywhere?" His little tests. I flunked, so he asked you. What are you talking about? I wasn't groovy enough. But you sure are. - And it wasn't me. So it had to be you. - So it wasn't me either. And then you gave me a bracelet? And what was that a consolation prize? Darlene, no. What did he say? "Oh, Darlene's a sweet girl, I don't want to hurt her feelings, but you know... " And you! "O yeah, Darlene's a really sweet girl. My best friend is a really sweet girl... ...but you know what, she's no match for you. " You've ruined my whole life. Do you see that? Do you understand that? No more girlfriend? Thai people is good friends. No secrets between Thai friends. Not like Yankee girls. - Ferg! - Jason! Mary! Hey, babe. You look great. Don't lie to a lifer. Dad said they won't let you have hardly anything in here...so uh ...but we got you each a bra. It's padded. A little push-up in the padding. - Alice? - Great. Great. So you guys still hanging out together? No, we see Mary at Christmas, spring break. You're at college? Yeah. So do you like it? It's just State you know. I have this unbelievable moronic roommate. I mean, the girl sleeps in her socks. It's different than high school you know. That's good. That's really good. I saw your dad with your sister in the mall. She's gotten so big. You guys look so good. Attention! Visiting hours are over. All visitors must leave. Darlene! At least you're together. I mean... At least you have each other, right? Whatever she's on, I want some. Darlene! Darlene! She stay in infirmary. They find cockroach. It crawled in Darlene's ear. It caused infection. The doctor pulled it out from ear. Can I make a wish? Spirit house is not for wish. Spirit house not joke. I need to talk to the guard who forgot to lock the gate? - Help me. - Do you want to die? Velie, I've got money. Leave me alone. - Can I just talk to you? - No. You know that night I gave you the bracelet... I was with Nick that day. And he kissed me. We didn't do anything else. I promise. He tried, but I wouldn't let him. I should've told you he was a creep he was, but... I keep thinking, what if we had just gone to Hawaii like you wanted? What if I just let you pay for those drinks at the pool? What if I told you that Nick had come on to me? - wouldn't have been going to Hong Kong... - And we wouldn't be here. We won't be here much longer. I set it up. We're getting out. I need to go to the bathroom. Where's the damn car? I couldn't sleep. The coffee's fresh. Listen to this: "Customs was notified that Davis and Marano were carrying narcotics... ...by a telephone call from an anonymous informant. All attempts to identify the caller were unsuccessful. " They tape those calls, don't they? Do they? I don't know. Hey Bud, check this out. - Just had it installed. Good to see the - American Tax dollars so hard at work. - Hey, it's a living. Drink? - I don't think so. So what's up? You got a line on a guy named Skip K. Carn? Why? See? The letters, just rearranged. So, it's an anagram. What's that prove? - I think you know all about him. - I do huh? This is a recording from the anonymous informant who called customs. The caller was a young man with a heavy Australian accent. So? - It's Skip Carn. I'm sure. - On come on Bud, Prove it. It could be any good samaritan with an Aussie accent. Nah. Those girls didn't stand a chance. This scumbag bought eight tickets, on that Hong Kong flight. My girls were getting busted, while his real couriers sailed on through. Yeah, that sounds about right, it still doesn't remove the smack from your girl's bag. Damn it, Roy! They're gonna die in that shithole if we don't do something. The only thing I know about Skip Carn, is that he's a low-level hustler. He's a bottom-feeder. And he must have some friends in high places. And that's it? One friend... ...in a really high place. So he had to give up a couple mules to the authorities.. because he had six other mules on the same flight. Could you stop saying that word? We're not mules. Certainly. The many who called himself Nick Parks tipped off customs... ...to create a diversion. If they are busy with you, they won't have time to search the six other couriers. It's a type of insurance for these kind of people. So, so the cops, or the customs guys They'll get paid extra money... ...when they make a dope bust? Right? - Right. So we were like a walking bribe. Yes. Now they're going to add 15 years to our sentence for trying to escape. Well, you have been busy, Mr. Greene. - Please, sit down. - Thank you. Getting those two young girls set free. I wager has a quite few shekels in it for you? A few. Yeah. You know, it occurs to me that I am already the source of your good fortune. How's that exactly, sir? I keep catching these vial little drug smugglers, and you keep defending them. I feel I'm owed some sort of tribute from you. It's a regular food chain isn't sir? Yes, that's exactly what it is. And I guess Skip Carn would know a thing or two... ...about paying tribute to you. You know, I expect a little more from you Mr. Greene. You're acting like... What is that colorful American expression? An ambulance chaser. I'm kind of a loose cannon now. So you know that colorful American expression? Because I would love to blow this thing right out of the water. You have a cozy relationship here with a known drug trafficker. You know, this is exactly the kind of thing... that stateside they love watching on TV. Two American girls' have their lives ruined by a sleazebag smuggler... ...and the greedy top cop in his pocket. You're going to have to get ready for Larry King. You know the colorful suspenders guy? You'll love him. And Barbara Walters. Now that, they're just going to cut in a couple pictures of you. It will be mostly Barbara, and the parents going into the bedroom: "This is Darlene's room, exactly as she left it. " - A couple Teddy bears propt up against... - Is there a point to this fantasy? Yes, sir, it's a simple point. I need your help. That's a good accent. My Spanish teacher always told me, "Good ear, bad memory. " - How's Darlene doing? - She's better. - We'll just wait for her then. - Can I ask you something? Since there's no money left, why are you here? No matter how I look at it, you don't deserve this. - Even if I did it? - Yeah, but... You didn't do it. We both know it. I wanted you to hear this at the same time. You're gonna get to go home. - How? - You're gonna have to sign a statement. And you have to admit you're wrong, and that Nick was a figment of your imagination. - No. A statement? No, I can't do that. I know, but its okay. This is how it works here. This is the official, face-saving confession. All you have to do is corroborate the official police version of events. That's our part of the deal. Then the crown will pardon you. Then you get to go home. All right. It's okay. No pardon. Narcotic offender. - What's the problem? - No pardon. Narcotic offender. We had an agreement. Your Minister of Justice has agreed. We have an agreement. You tell him that we have an agreement. I'm sorry. They are narcotics smugglers. You son of a bitch, we had a deal. We had a deal. Yes, nicely done. You really had me going. But now there is no more Skip Carn. So you won't be getting to him. No one will be getting to him, so there is no more deal. Wait. No, get them off me. You may speak English. My best friend Darlene is not a drug smuggler. I know this. She is innocent. My friend is innocent. All she ever did wrong was to trust me. Here in Thailand you believe that one friend does, the other one knows about. Maybe that is true friendship... ...but I'm an American, and I was not that kind of a friend to her. I know this. I know this because because I did it. I did it because I was foolish... ...and because I was jealous. I was afraid she was going to drift away. I was afraid I was going to lose her. She never knew. It was all me. She spent all this time in your prison for my mistakes. I'm sorry. Please, please if you need someone to do the time, let me do it. I'll do her time and mine. Just let her go, please. Then you're of strong character and would lie to me to save your friend? No, no I am of weak character. And I just want to make up for my mistakes. If you're lying, and want to save your friend... ...then you're of sufficient character to earn what you want. If you're telling the truth... ...then your friend is innocent and should go free. If you are willing to serve her term and yours... ...your friend is pardoned. Thank you. Thank you. Darlene must go soon Alice. You're a very good liar. Alice, you didn't do it. I know you didn't do it. And I don't think I can leave you. If I say it was the truth... ...you'll hate me. And if I say I lied... ...then when you go home, all the time you are there with your family... You won't be able to just be happy. So let's just say it was the right thing to do. Let's just leave it at that. Come now Darlene. - I'm going to get you out of here. - I know. Go, Dar. I need you to. Please. I know a lot of people won't understand why I said I did it. But for me, it was the right thing to do. Maybe more right than anything I've ever done before. And I know Darlene and Hank will never stop trying... ...till I'm out of here. Until I'm free.
