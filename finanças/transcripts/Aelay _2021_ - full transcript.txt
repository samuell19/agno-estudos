I dedicate this film to the late writer, Mr. Ka. Si. Sivakumar who helped me in developing this script. -Halitha Shameem. Shall I tell you a story, sir? Hey, you... I got a call last evening that my dad has passed away. Since my office is in Perungalathur, I managed to catch the last bus out of Chennai. The man next to me kept snoring loudly. And they kept playing loud movies in the bus. I couldn't sleep a wink. I didn't worry about my dad's death as much as I did about my lost sleep. His son is coming only now. He has come to see his father's cold body. Poor thing must be hurting so much. My child... Look at your father! I am the first to see him dead. I brought him food thinking he must be hungry. But he took his last breath in his sleep. My son was longing to see you. But you had an unresolved feud with him. Had you spoken to him before he died, my son wouldn't have had any regrets. I wonder what my son had in mind while breathing his last. When did you arrive? I got the news around 8 o'clock yesterday. I arrived around 10 o'clock. I couldn't visit him often even though I stay in the next town over. He bought Chinna's favorite snack only last week. He used to say that Chinna resembles you when you were young. But you didn't speak to him till the end. Don't start again. I'm starving. Is there anything to eat? Why do you do this? I'll send you some tea if I can. Okay, I'll be back. Don't take the front entrance, go this way. He hasn't eaten anything since morning. Give him some snacks. Open your mouth, come on. KADAIKUTTY SINGAM Hey, I heard that that movie is good. Yes, I heard so too. It's a comedy movie. Let's watch it later today. Oh, lady with a basket... Oh you're clicking a selfie? Go take one with your crap. Go away. -We're not far, don't get down. -It's all right. Let's go. -Hey! Praise the Lord. -Praise the Lord. -In our town... -In our town... -the late-- -Sir... -Here you go. -Let us send off our beloved Muthukutty on his journey to the afterworld... Stop... You have the liquor, right? Have it. Sit down. Come, Parthy. This way. We had gone to book the photographer. We were held back. We're overseeing the rituals. Everyone is hyped now, but if something goes amiss, they'll create a ruckus. -What about these old men? -They're tossing coins to see who's next. Your turn now. How come you came alone? Where's grandma? She can't make it. -The artists have started from Theni. -Artists? -They'll be here by noon. -Sir. Why inform him? Aren't we the ones paying you? -Let's talk. -He might expect extra money. -Come on... -We'll take care of this. Be strong, child. The dead are not going to come back alive. Your father will surely rest in peace. Could you tell me where I can quench my thirst? I'm sorry? Where are the beverages served? -Are you Muthukutty's son? -Yes. -I asked if you're Muthukutty's son. -Yes, I am his son. You've prospered after moving to the city, my son. I can see the change in you. Parthy, this is the photo we've given for the posters. Is it okay? -It's up to you. -How could you do this? What's wrong? -He was speaking to me just yesterday. -Okay. He said he was leaving for home but he has left all of us. So he died after talking to you. -Yes. -What did you talk about? I was talking about myself that if I die on a Saturday evening, it'll be easy for others to visit on Sunday. He took my words to heart and died peacefully. -Oh... -I meant it for myself. He is asking for copyrights. Get him some coffee. How could you do this to me! -Tell me! -Come this way, sir. -Watch your head. -I meant it for myself. -He died so suddenly. -Yes, he did. -Is the funeral today or tomorrow? -It's today. What about yours? You are a menace indeed. You brat, I'll teach you a lesson. I'll break your jaw. Be careful, I'll tear your face apart. Let's wait till the cremation and pack some meat on the way back. -Let's go home at our leisure. -Okay. Adjust your sari. -Come on, beat it... -Oh, no... Beat it... Oh, no, how could this happen... What do I do? Muthukutty is no more! -What do we do? -What are you glaring at? I'll dig your eyes out, rascal. Stay right there. -Come, click a picture. -I'll go after everyone else. -Sir, come this way. -Sir, come on. -Come on, ma'am. -Come. Stay right there. Come on. -You're his son, aren't you? -Yes. Try to look sad. Oh, no, you've left us... Sir, let me click a selfie. -Hey, move. -You'll get beaten up. -Go. -Go away. -Uncle! -Sweetheart! Come here, come here. -When did you arrive? -Just now. -Where's Chinna? -He's playing. Is he playing? Do you want some tamarind? My dear... Here, have some. -Eat it. -Oh, Lord... Is it sour? Really... -Hey, give me some tamarind. -Do you want some? Give it to me. -You poor thing... -Here you go. How could you leave us like this? -Oh, Lord... -How could you take him from us? Muthukutty... How could you leave us? My gold tooth... My gold tooth is missing! -My gold tooth is missing! -Oh, no, you've left us... Move your leg. Let me check if you're sitting on my gold tooth. Move, come on. I can't find my gold tooth. You ladies, I can't find my gold tooth! He was bent on getting my gold tooth! He finally took it away through his granddaughter. You scoundrel! -What's wrong with her? -My gold tooth... Why are you cursing us, you witch? Go and bring Chinna. Parthy, we need your grandfather's name to publish obituary. -What's your grandfather's name? -It's Chellamuthu or Chellaiya. -Wait, I'll ask Meena. -It's Chellamuthu. Don't you know your grandpa's name? Your grandfather was a freedom fighter. Even if we forget it, you shouldn't forget your ancestry. It's Chellamuthu. Chellamuthu is the one who made our town famous for its boondhi. -Chellamuthu it is. -Okay, I'll do it. Sir, I like your ring tone. Do you have Bluetooth? I have a gold tooth. Want it? -You'll pay me as promised, right? -Yes, we will. -You'll let me go by 3 pm, right? -Just sing for an hour and you can go. She is the one who sings mourning songs. Come on. -She has come from Madurai to sing. -Are you here to sing? Let me go before 3 pm, I need to go to another funeral... So you've got appointments? What is his name? What was his occupation? His name is Muthukutty, he used to sell ice cream. His daughter's name is Meena and son's name is Parthy. Oh sweet Muthukutty, you made Everyone happy with your ice cream Oh sweet Muthukutty, You raised Parthy and Meena With so much care When you rode your bicycle Selling ice cream Everyone looked at you with awe The whole world turned its head To look at you But you have left all of us behind Oh, sweet Muthukutty... Muthukutty, wherever you are, come to the main entrance. We request Muthukutty to come to the main entrance. I heard it again. They're looking for our dad. -They say that he is missing. -He is not a child, he'll be around here. Who else would search for him when we are right here? Sir, I want to get down. -Sir. -What is it, child? Muthukutty is our father. We heard that he is missing. Isn't he here? I've announced it four times. Chandru, hold the mic. Let me come there. Come, let me check. -Where's the one who gave this paper? -He was dancing. He's dancing here. Hey, you... Who are you to Muthukutty? -Why do you ask? -You complained that he is missing. His children are searching for him. But you're dancing here without a care. Didn't I ask you to play silently? -What are you doing here? -I warned her but she started crying, Dad. -Dad? -Yes, I am their dad. I am Muthukutty. I wanted to hear name over the boombox. What is wrong in that? It was just for fun. Oh, God! You're playing with my bread and butter here. Beat it... -Sikkim. -Sikkim. -Bhutan. -Bhutan. -Manipur. -Manipur. -Assam. -Assam. Royal diamond. Dad, they didn't teach me about this place in my school. They wouldn't know it. Superb, Dad! You know everything about the world. Everything is right here. Dad, everyone in my class has bought the answer guide. I am the only one who hasn't. My teacher chides me about it. -Tell me who it is, I'll deal with them. -No. -Just get me the answer guide. -All right. Why involve caste in answer guides? Sir, get us the answer guide for sixth grade. Get the answer guide. Paranthaman, car driver. Passed away in 1998. Oh, Lord. Dhurian, car broker. He passed away in 2002. Hey, what's that written in English? It says "PN", Dad. -What about that one? -It says the same. If they have the same initials, then... -Sir. -Yes? Dhurian from this town who died last year and Paranthaman who died in 1998... Were they brothers? I've heard about them. But I don't know if they were brothers. You don't... Paranthaman was a driver here. He died of a heart attack. I don't know if he was Dhurian's brother. Dad, I'm getting late for school. Let's go. Yes, don't be hasty. Come on. This is a kind of knowledge too. Not everything is learned from books. I know several things, right? -Were Dhurian and Paranthaman brothers? -I don't know. Everyone has ganged up against me. They must have been brothers. These guys don't know. People tend to forget the dead quite easily. Rs. 5 lakhs for Rs. 5! KAS LOTTERIES You can buy a car and travel in class! You can brag and boast. The Goddess of Wealth calls you. Jesus calls us here. The Goddess of Wealth calls us there. Let's see what She has to offer. -Hi, sir! -Hi, Muthukutty! -What happened to the lottery pool? -Don't get me started. The whole thing backfired on me. Why don't you pool with me? Five of us can split a ticket of Rs. 50. -Cooperating for mutual benefits. -Dad, that's wrong. -Cooperation is a survival strategy. -Shut up. I only have the bus fare. Add these under my tab. Let me take them now. I'll pay you next time. What do I do if you run away? I don't even trust the locals. And you are from the next town. -Why don't you give me some collateral? -Collateral? M PARTHY -Dad! -I bought this just now for Rs. 25. I'll take it from your son next week. Here, take it inside. Strike his name. Why are you breathing heavily? Let's strike off his name next week. If I win, you don't have to go to a public school. I'll send you to a private school. It's in your best interest. My sweetheart. -Ice cream! -Hey, Muthukutty. Hey, gorgeous! Come on. -Here. -Give me a rose milk flavored one. Is one enough? Here you go. Have it before your grandchildren find out. This goes on your tab too? Whom do I ask if you die suddenly? Don't you want an ice cream? I do, but I don't have money. Did I ask you to pay, Naachiya? They wouldn't give me money to buy ice cream from you as it's unhealthy. Unhealthy? They gave me this, but I don't like it. I want a Popsicle. Um... I'll give you a Popsicle. Will you give me this? Hey, you... Ta-da! Wow. -Bye, Mr. Ice Cream Man! -Bye, sweetheart. Get two balls of ice cream tomorrow. AELAY ICE CREAM It's fragrant inside.

This is the middle seat. We'd be safe from accidents. Our skulls will be safe. Okay, you stay right here. I'll be back. Stay here, okay? I'll be right back. Good morning, ma'am. Good morning, Parthy. Thanks, ma'am. Dad, they're starting the bus. Make it quick! -Come on! -I'm here... -They wouldn't dare leave your dad behind. -Don't keep the basket on the seat. Get another ticket otherwise. -Kalavathy! -Hey, Prabha, come. How are you? -I'm fine. -You got transferred... Hey, who is that smoking in the bus? If I catch you, I'll kick you out of the bus. Did you have to pay for it? Hey, I had blocked this seat. Oh, is it you who blocked the seat? I thought it was the government. Hey, fatso. You can laugh later. Where are my slippers? Placing your slippers on the seat doesn't make the seat yours. -It does. -Not anymore. I threw away your slippers to teach you a lesson. What! Y-You threw them away? Yes, what about it now? I have to worship you. How dare you sit on the seat I blocked and tease me about it? You don't have to teach me a lesson, you glutton. -Hey, don't you dare call me names! -Dad... -How dare you... -Stop it, Dad. Please. -What is it? -She is my teacher. Oh, is she a teacher? No wonder my son fails all his subjects. If you eat salt, you must drink water. -Stop it, Dad. -This expanding glutton is a teacher. Hey, Muthukutty! Why are you troubling her? Hey, you do your duty and I'll do mine. It's a given that I should ask this. Is it wrong to use my slippers to book a seat? -Everyone's looking. -Get my slippers back or turn the bus around. She has thrown them away. I am sloshed. Yet I'm speaking with patience. -I'm sorry, ma'am. -Kick them out. -Who was that? -Stop the bus. This guy is causing a scene. This is nothing. Stop the bus, turn it around. Listen to me. Don't cause trouble. -Just get down already. -Get down? -Go find them. -All of you are in on this. Find them yourself. If she is the one teaching, my son won't go anywhere in life. -Get down. -Everyone's looking. Let me see how you drive again on this road. Be careful! You messed with the wrong guy. I'll teach you a lesson. My sweetheart, come on. What is this? Did you contract bird flu? Who is it? Hey, you! You are up to something. I'm not up to anything. Somebody asked me directions to your house. -Who was it? -Somebody from Thirumangalam. -Did you tell him? -I told him that you're home. It hurts... -What happened, Dad? -My chest hurts. -Bring the grandma from next door. -Dad. Run! Oh, God... Only when you fall sick do you realize the significance of a wife. You should have remarried at least to keep yourself in check. The jaundice took your wife. You are raising your children as a single dad. But you don't know how to hold your tongue. You poke your nose in everyone's business and meddle in other's affairs... -Hey, move aside. -...as a hobby. Your cholesterol levels have gone up and caused this. Make him drink this potion a little at a time. I'll ask my son to bring a vehicle. We must visit Dr. Kanagaraj to get him treated. We shouldn't take chest pains lightly. Here, get him a bottle of soda. Hey, Muthukutty. I'll visit you when you're feeling better. -I'll take your leave. -Sure, sir. People experiencing chest pains should be careful. They may die anytime. It's common in his age though. Did he leave? Were you scared? -Why are you getting up? -The money lender came unannounced. -Give it to me. -He did it to fool the money lender. How funny! Even the greatest actors don't stand a chance. He gave them a run for their money. Were the children in on the act? What are you laughing at? Get lost. Go home. Don't you have anything better to do? Hey, why are you crying? Do you love me so much? Is this how you'd cry for me? Is this how you'll cry when I die? But this is not enough for me. Don't cry. Forget it. Muthukutty, is everything ready? Everything is ready. Close your tab today. We're so close. -You still have to pay. -Don't do this over a piece of bun. How could you? LIQUOR PRICES INCREASE BY 3% They've increased the price of our fuel. MANI TEA STALL Stay right on the road, okay? Eat your fill. Someone has staked a rooster over there. Someone's coming. Hey! Didn't I ask you to stay on the road? Hey... Hey... You're running like an athlete. Stand right there, okay? Hey, look over there. Your dad is playing with chicks on the road. The plan worked! Oh, no... My hen! You murderer! -I didn't run over it. -Did my hen commit suicide then? It wasn't even a hen, it was a chick. How can you prove it now that you've run over it? -Pay me Rs. 500. -Rs. 500? My hen was about to lay eggs. Sir, I'm an honorable teacher. -I teach kids for a living. -I raise hens for a living. I don't have Rs. 500, I have only Rs. 300. Give me what you have then. I'm sure you'll run over it again. Take it out. Stop counting already. See how cunning your dad is? This is why we should take real good care of our chicks. He takes real good care to kill them. Settle my tab. -Come on. -All your sins will go to your son. I've been saving up since last Diwali. I should've kept it hidden. He has stolen everything. I wanted to buy new clothes this year instead of the usual hand-me-downs. -I hate him! -Leave it, Parthy. Let me give you an idea. Let's buy a new piggy bank and keep it there. Lord Muni will not let anyone steal it. -What if Muni takes it? -Lower your voice! How dare you talk ill of Lord Muni here! If He hears it, we're done for. -Why? -Don't you know about Lord Muni? Don't you know about His pot full of gold? I heard that there is a big pot full of gold buried over there. Lord Muni protects it. If we sacrifice a black cat, a pregnant cow and a young boy like you, Lord Muni will voluntarily give us the gold. -Where did you hear it? -From many sources. -Does everyone know? -Almost. -What about our dad? -I don't know if he knows about it. If he does, he would've sacrificed me. Why do they only want a young boy? Why don't they sacrifice our dad? Why do you always pee at this spot, Parthy? It's a free flow in this spot. If I don't empty my bladder, I can't sit through the class. Shall we keep the new piggy bank near Lord Ayyanar's temple? Okay, Parthy. -Good morning, sir! -Good morning. Sit down, sit down. Children... He is the new teacher who will teach you Tamil and Social subjects. -Hey, he is the one! -He used to teach in MHSS School... He is the one who paid for killing a chick. -Really? -His name is Rajendran. -Greetings, sir. -Let him teach now. Okay, sir! All right. I'll ask for your names in the next class. Let me teach you some proverbs and their meanings now. -Poor thing, he can't escape us. -Ready? -You can repeat after me, okay? -Okay, sir. DATE: 21-10-2003 CLASS: 6 C Time and tide... -Time and tide... -He paid Rs. 300! -He is going to get it bad. -Yes. ...wait for none. Wait for none. -A hen's tread... -A hen's tread... Let's ask if his bike can kill a chick. -...won't kill the chicks. -...won't kill the chicks. Sir, he is asking if your bike can't kill the chick. Hey! He has nowhere to go. HAPPY DIWALI What is this? Why are you sitting all gloomy? See what I have bought you. Here, eat this. Come on. I've bought you a lot of fireworks. Here's a toy gun. Keep this. Look, I got you new clothes. For your sister as well. Wear the new clothes and show them off. That will make me proud. -Do you think he stole from the temple? -Keep quiet. He might hear us. Parthy, come here. I'll take you to someone's house. There is a TV and many toys. You can play there. -What about Meena? -Let her play here. Come on. Sit here. Get down. -Who is this, Dad? -I'll tell you, wait. -Hi. -Parthy! How are you, dear? -I'm good. -Stay with me for a while. -Greetings, sir. Welcome. -Greetings. -Eat with us. -Have you told him everything? -Yes, I've told him. -Great. -Say bye to your dad. -Bye! -Bye, Dad. -Stay for a while. I'll pick you up in the evening. Meena! Meena! -Get me the hammer. -Sir. My dad is not home. So what? I'll return it once I'm done. Bring it. -Is your dad out? -Yes. I'll return it in the evening. Inform your dad. -Bye. -Okay, sir. Dad, Mr. Moopan took your hammer when you were not home. I gave it to him, but he said that a bird knocked it into a well. Don't ask me anything. I can't ask him. You can ask him yourself. Go on, eat. That little... Who is it at this hour? -Where's my hammer? -Hey. -Can't you see that I'm sleeping? -Why should I see that? I'll buy you a new hammer in the morning. I want my hammer back. Oh, God... How dare you sleep when I'm talking to you! Why are you troubling me? Bring it to me! -Hey, you! Come here! -Wait! Stop, don't leave me behind! Hey! Hear the ice cream horn?

Bring a week's worth of snacks when you come this weekend. -Hey, what do you think of me? -What? If he leases me out, should I bring you food? Am I something to be rented out? Didn't I ask you not to tell him? He doesn't talk to our dad. Hey, I'll break your jaw with this rock! -Get away! -You... Go ask your dad! Why are you asking me?

Let me welcome these gold-clad and generous men who are approaching us. Move. Greetings, everyone. The late Muthukutty borrowed Rs. 10 lakhs from me in his full consciousness. Here's the promissory note for the same. -Anyone can verify it. -Did he tell you anything about it? His immediate relatives should pay me Rs. 10 lakhs right now. Or write me a promissory note. If you refuse to do both, I won't let you cremate the body. -I won't let this funeral proceed further. -Let me talk to him. Do you know anything? You scoundrel! Come here! His dad is dead and is this the time to collect your debt, you fool? -Granny, go away. -Don't touch me! Won't you listen to me? How dare you! Will you stop a funeral for the sake of money? Then how do I get my money back? Will you remain quiet if it was your money? -Don't touch me. -Shut up! -Hey, go away! -How dare you! -Hey, wait. -Yes, what of it? His son is here, right? Just a minute. Wait, stop. Approach us legally through an advocate. Did your father ask an advocate before taking a loan from me? There is a problem. Did I say that I won't pay? Did I say that I won't pay? I won't let you take the body! -What is this? -Do what you can. -Hey, put me down! -Call whoever you want. I won't let you take the body. -Don't create a scene. -How dare you! -Let me go! He is testing my patience. -What will you do? I'll get your money back, come on. -Humans lose their value... -Hey! I sing out of grief Let them go at each others' throats The grief is overwhelming The grief is overwhelming Something seems fishy. Why would your dad borrow so much money? He must have gotten into something big. What is it this time? They find new ways to gamble all the time. You were so uptight that you won't take my money. I'd still leave money for you on the table, right? Why didn't you ask me? -Why did you take such a loan? -Hey... -Answer me! -Naachiya was here when you were away. Why are you telling him that? Leave it. W-Was Naachiya here? Was Naachiya here? W-Why didn't you tell me? I knew that she'd come. Woolflower. This is the garland she got, right? That's her favorite. Did you treat her well? Did Meena speak to her? Did she look for me? Why wasn't I here then? Sorry... You're Naachiya's friend. I won't scold you. She rejected me, but she came to see you. I won't scold you. -Thank you. -Bye. Women these days are so beautiful. Back then, there was barely any beauty. You can't say that for sure. Women were fit working in the fields. Don't forget that. Girls are always beautiful. What is the point in having you as a kin? -You don't care about me. -You seem fit and fine. I plan on getting married. I'm growing old, right? Getting married? Learn to walk without tripping on your own foot before that. Worry about your youth after that. Let me talk to him. Sir! Sir! Don't talk to him. -Senga! -How are you? -I'm good, how are you? -Aren't you watching the competition? -Senga. -Ask your husband to buy you an ice cream. -Come on. -No, sir. I have a sore throat.

Four grams of gold! Guruprasath has surfaced with a bleeding nose, unable to hold his breath any longer. Volunteer Alwin is helping him out of the water. Hey, volunteers, come on! Run to their aid. The volunteers are doing their duty as lifeguards to those who can't breath and as a referee to those who surface during the game to catch a breath. Hey, what is this? Why are you holding a voodoo doll? And that's the cue for Dhanraj to exit the competition. Let's wait and see. We'll soon know who the winner is. Wow! There! Look! He comes out of the water like Baahubali! Here comes the winner holding the painted pebble, the winner of the gold coin... -What was his name again? -It's Parthy. -He was the winner last time too. -The winner is Parthy! I just learned that he won the competition the last two years as well. His friends have already reached him to celebrate the victory. His parents must be really proud right now. There's no doubt that this is a precious moment for them. His gait looks like he'll be the winner in the upcoming years as well. Guruprasath is getting first aid now. But there are still others underwater who don't even know that the competition is over. They will receive consolation prices. Here comes the victor! -He is galloping to the stage. -Parthy! Congratulations! Superb! Welcome! Congratulations! -He always wins. -Now. They gift him a shawl. The elder of the town, Mr. Kuppusamy offers the shawl to the winner. The landlord, the most generous of them all, is offering the gold coin to the winner, Parthy. Parthy! The landlord offers sweets to the victor and makes this moment sweeter on stage. Congratulations! They make it sound like he has won the World Cup. Of course, we have to encourage him. This is a big deal. Your father has already given him the gold. Congratulations to the winner! My dear... Sir, I want a cigar. -Take it. -I want a cigarette. -I want one too. -Take it. What does he want? He is a teetotaler. Get him some tea. He'll get a fever if he tries to smoke. Just sit down. You're lighting it the wrong way. Have you ever seen me doing that? I got emotional, buddy. See, my eyes are tearing up. I wanted to go to Goa. You struggled so much to make my wish come true. Liar! You teared up because of the smoke. All of us wish to go to Goa. He didn't do it only for you. You want to go to Goa, right? Hey, call the pawn shop. Call them! They might step out for lunch. All right? Ask him to keep the money ready. Then he might waste our time dilly-dallying. Okay? Let's pawn it and catch the bus tonight. -Tonight? -Let's do it right away. Why should we wait? Call him! How much do four grams cost? -I'm checking. -Wow! We're going to Goa! Let me update my status first. Sir, I'll pay you later. -Don't push me! -We're coming, Goa! Sir, keep counting. Let him check it. Hey, I don't have a good bag. Shall I pack my clothes in your bag? Hey, we'll carry you on our shoulders if we have to. Don't worry. I have a huge bag. Let's use that. There's north Goa and then there's south Goa. -Where shall we go first? -North Goa... There's a mountain with a huge sign that says "Kingfisher". That should be our first destination. Everything else can wait. -Hey, wait a minute. -What is it, sir? -Isn't it 24 carat? Even 20 carats would-- -This is not even gold. It's fake. The plating is melting. This isn't worth anything. Take it with you. -We've been fooled. -What? Keep it inside, sir. Close it. Sir, which solution did he pour on it? Which solution was it? Hey, come on. PAWN SHOP Hey, which bus shall I book? Which one? Tell me quickly. -There are not many seats left. -Wait. Hey, tell me! Parthy, hey... You tricked us, you fraudster! -You scoundrel! -What happened? At least the cup was real. He fooled us with the gold. GRAND SWIMMING COMPETITION You fraudster. DISTRICT COLLECTORATE -Hey, how long do we have to wait? -The cameraman will be here in 30 minutes. He just called. Be patient, he'll be here. -Who is coming? -They're from a channel. Popular. -Popular. -Popular TV. Is that the only one? -Isn't that enough? -How long do we have to wait? Hey, hold the buffalo. To help me study... -Are your initials right? -Yes, they are. Do you want to come along? No, I'm waiting for Vinu. You go ahead. -Oh, Vinu is coming? Okay, bye. -Yes. -Let's go. -Bye, dear. Should I hold on to the buffalo while you booze? -You're the right person for it. -Hey. How come the writer is so young? Shall we try giving her the petition? Hey, I asked because she looks so petite. I've never seen her before. They pop out of nowhere. Hey, have you also started changing your attention? Hey, he is also a teenager. -You're right. -Hey. Do you really not know who she is? Who is she? She is the landlord's daughter! -Is that his daughter? -Yes. It must be four years since she got her periods. I think it was around Diwali, 2011. -How do you know so much about that? -Just like that. His father hung up posters everywhere to celebrate his daughter's coming of age. That was the first time we saw so many posters. She is covered in gold from head to toe. Her pendant looks so enchanting. -But he ended up tricking us. -Let's fight for justice then. -Let this be a lesson to her. -Yes, let's go and reform them. A crime is a crime, no matter who commits it. What's up with them? Let's do what we came here for. Come on, hey... RATHINA SABAPATHY WRITER We want to write a petition. I'm not the writer, I came here to help a friend. You can help us too. Yes, do it. You played well the other day. I meant the swimming competition. I played? -Right. -What's your name? Parthy. Write it neatly, okay? -Address? -RS Polytechnic College, Idayapatti. -What's her name? -Naachiya. I think it's Naachiya. My dear... Honorable... No, write "honorable". -Honorable... -Just tell me the issue. -I'll write it. -Is that so? To... Write whatever your name is. When I staked my life and held my breath underwater to find the painted pebble and emerge as a winner the landlord, your father, fed me sweets and pretended to give me a gold coin all the while being applauded, when in reality, it was a fake coin. So we humbly declare that we will take back what is rightfully ours from you, his daughter. -Thank you. Write this down. -Thank you. Go on, write. -Hey... -Hey, catch her! -Stop. Don't ask. -Who are they? I'll tell you, just go! -Hey! -Pal, she took to her heels! We should've actually robbed her of her jewels. -An umbrella. -An umbrella. -A lotus. -Greetings! Aunt, look, it's Pluto the dog. -Pluto the dog. -...college students gave the petition to a buffalo in front of the Collector's office. They've been giving petitions to the Collector asking to build a bus stop -and a speed break near their college... -Look at their audacity! -Since their petitions were not heeded... -Do you think the Collector saw it? they took such drastic yet comedic measures. -That's a buffalo. -This is Arogyanandan from Popular TV. SHRI ANNAMALAYAR DRIVING SCHOOL Sir, do you have a coil motor? -Just a minute, Aunt. -A coil motor? I have this one only. Oh, God... Look here, Parthy, someone's raining on your cycle. -Aunt! Come here! -Hey! Who are you? Who is your aunt? -Aunt! -Hey, twist his ears. -Twist his ears. -He's just a kid. -Oh, no! -Hey! -You're still peeing! -Aunt! -How dare you! Call your aunt. -I can't stop! -Come here, Aunt. -Call her. Come quickly, Aunt. -Come here, Aunt. -How dare you pee on my cycle! -Come here, Aunt! -Gandhi! Hey, Gandhi! Gandhi! -Gandhi-- -Gandhi! Hey, Gandhi! Gandhi! Come here. Don't try to run away. Come here. You ran away the other day too. Now, you make your nephew pee on my cycle. Haven't I warned you against peeing on others' cycles? -Isn't he the buffalo man we saw on TV? -You little... I'll twist your limbs now. You'll have trouble peeing after that. Come on, he is just a kid. What do you want now? Wipe it. It stinks. -Crap. -It's okay. I didn't apologize. You've stepped on crap. Hey. Come on. These are my mom's old jewels. They're not mine. How's that? You look for it. I'll go and buy a cage. Come back soon. I'll start searching. Hey, birdie, where are you? Hey... Who dropped you here? Let's sit in the shade. Are you scared? -Where are you going? -Naachiya. Naachiya. What are you doing here alone? I've to place this bird in a cage. My friends have gone to buy one. -Are you going to put it in a cage? -Yes. I saw it yesterday and felt bad that I couldn't help it. I had nightmares that it was eaten by a vulture. Naachiya, it has wings. It's learning to fly. Like how we learn to walk or cycle, it's learning to fly. Look, its parents are watching from over there. Come on. Its mother might abandon it if it smells of a human. Oh, is there such a thing? Yes. We can help it if it had fallen off the nest without wings. So it's learning to fly? -Will it fly? -It will. Where do you have to go? Tell me, I'll drop you. -No, my friends will come. -When will they? You're not buying the cage, right? I'll drop you where they are. I don't want to get in your car. I'm doing this out of concern. If I leave, you'll stand here all alone. Hey, I'm from this town too. I'm sure someone I know will pass by shortly. -Just you wait. -Okay. Isn't he the plumber I know? He's not looking back. -Someone will come. -Let's see. I guess people are sleeping after eating their fill. Hey, you... Uncle! Mr. Ice Cream Man! Didn't I tell you? -Uncle! -Naachiya, dear. Uncle! -I didn't bring ice cream today. -That's okay. Why are you here? There are wastrels around. Yes, let's leave right away. Wait, let me push you. Come on! -Hop on. -Go slowly. Shall we go? Hey, you... Who is he honking at? See how he looks at us. -What an attitude! -That's true. He's my son, after all. -Your... -He is a pepper-upper. Let me do it, Aunt. Here, this is tea with pepper. Drink it. -What did you say? -It's tea with pepper. Drink it. Hello? Your cousin goes to RS College, right? -Yes. -I need a help. There's a student named Parthy. He works part time as a driving coach. -He is the ice cream man's son. -Who is that? His father sells ice cream. He even staged a demonstration by giving a petition to a buffalo. -He was on TV too! -What do you want now? -I want his number. -I'll get it for you. -Oh, God... -Yes! Look at her glee. Naachiya. Don't be scared. There's no one around. -Did you ask for my number? -Yes. We don't have a phone at home. Why did you want my number? I wanted to return something to you. No, it's okay. I don't want it. I knew that Mr. Muthukutty has a son, but I didn't know... I've sent you ice cream in hollow balls. -Was that yours? -Yes. He'd eat all the ice cream and give me the ball. He is such a kid. He felt bad that you haven't spoken to him properly in years. Why aren't you talking to him? There's no specific reason. Two swords cannot fit into the same sheath, right? It's like that. If he is home, I won't be there and vice versa. How come? Don't you get along with each other? If money lenders come asking for him, I wouldn't rat him out. He'd do the same for me. Whatever. I don't understand what's going on between you two. I've played behind your house in childhood. Your house used to be a landmark back then. I found an empty soap packet behind your house. I brought it home and kept it on the shelf. The whole house turned fragrant. I have a blocked nose now. Do you still use the same soap? She is from a rich background. I don't want to pursue this. But I have confidence that I'll become successful one day. -What do I do? -Bury that confidence. Just do your job. Okay. You pay your college fees by working part time. I'm proud of you for saving up and getting your sister married. Don't become ordinary like us by getting into this. You were underwater and yet you made me fall for you. - Naachiya Parthy You gave life to my soul, my love! Let's arrange a feast And get married in a grand ceremony We are bound together like the two sides Of the same coin, my dear All I want is to spend The rest of my life with you by my side Even when the sun is scorching, I feel cool as a cucumber When she is by my side Her smile makes me feel Like a twilight muzzle That is all I need in life, my love!

Let's arrange a feast And get married in a grand ceremony We are bound together like the two sides Of the same coin, my dear All I want is to spend The rest of my life... I have become ordinary too.

My chest flutters Like a sparrow's wings When I think about you, Something brightens up inside me Target found. Muthukutty! Muthukutty! My dear! This hammer belonged to your dad. We've dug up the well many times before. After all these years, we found it today. Bury this along with him. His soul will rest in peace. Your soul has departed the body The entire family is filled with sorrow As they mourn your death As they mourn your death Rs.35,000? Why did you spend so much for the bier? It will be paid by your sister. Don't worry. -Show me the bill. -Is that Yama, the God of Death? Hey, I'm not ready to leave. Go away from here. I have a lot of duties. I should get my grandchildren married. I will come after two months. Go away from here. Hey, Selvi. -Come. I brought food. -Go away. -Come soon. -Go away. I'm starving. Come soon. ...Muthukutty!

My beloved Muthukutty has left me alone He has left me and moved on My son would never bath in cold water. Take this hot water. -He won't shave his head. -Okay. -What about the hand? -Yes, shave a bit from his hand. Who is playing wedding songs near a funeral? Whoever it is, stop it until the body is taken away. Is that Murugan Sound Service? It's a grand wedding. They must've hired someone from the town. Whose wedding? Landlord Loganathan's youngest daughter is getting married. Loganathan's daughter? Who is the groom? He is from Keeranur, the heir to Suryaprabha Mills. Oh, God! The kid is heartbroken. My grandson is heartbroken. Muthukutty was hale and hearty. He should've lived for a few more years. His death is so unfair! Don't cry, my precious. It hurts to see you cry. -What's wrong, Parthy? -What is it? -Why didn't you tell me about her wedding? -What's the point? What would you have done? You broke up, right? You left to forget her! I didn't want to remind you... Do you know that we broke up? What do you know? Everyone is betraying me. Ask the son to come. He needs to perform some rituals. -What the hell! -Forget about it. Just stay calm for a while. You need to perform a few rituals. They need you there. It's only the engagement. The wedding is in two days. So we have time. First, let's finish this. -Then let's decide what to do. -We'll help you complete the rituals soon. -Okay? Everything will be fine. -Right! Come. Sir! Hold on a minute. We can't bury the body today. His relatives are on the way. -If we bury the body, it'll be a problem. -What are you saying? -Why didn't you tell this earlier? -Please understand our situation. We can cremate him as soon as they come. The flowers on the bier are starting to wither. Do as you wish! -Come back tomorrow. -Leave now! Ladies can start singing. We'll bury the body tomorrow. -Is that all? -I'll explain later! -Our beloved Muthukutty has left us... -Go on. Join them. Let's go. -Oh, dear Lord -Oh, dear Lord -Oh, dear Lord -Oh, dear Lord We have lost our dear man We have lost him -Parthy! -Parthy! -What's wrong? -You father's body is gone! -What are you saying? -I don't understand. We were preparing the bier. When we went inside to bathe him, the body was gone. I don't know what to do. -Stop the car for a minute. -Stop it. -Why? -Stop the car. -What? Where are you going? -We'll be back. They must have planned something. Let's use this to keep the beer chilled. You're always clever when it comes -to partying! -Hey, awesome! -Ask them to follow them everywhere. -Okay, sir! I snatched it from him. -How is this? -I can't make them understand. Make this moron understand that we'll miss the train if we don't leave now. Hey, come on! Let me search inside. What a creation! -Sister, control yourself. -How can I? We didn't look after him when he was alive. We failed to protect him even after he died. -This is a sin! -Say it to everyone then! -Let everyone know. -What will happen if they find out? Stay calm. The back door is open. Some animal must've dragged his body. If the villagers find out, they'll gossip for the rest of our lives. -What are we going to do? -Make sure the movie plays continuously. Keep the water pot outside. Nobody should enter the house. We should find it before dawn. Keep the liquor flowing. If they get sober, all hell will break loose. Sister, take care. Let's go. Take the torch. -Call us if you need anything. -The torch must be on the slab. -Got it? -Here it is! -You got it? -Hey! Why are you sitting here? Get up. Let's go. Hey, check over there. No, no! Don't! Heck. Two creatures are making out. Look at the place they've chosen. Selvam, point the light in that direction. -He hit a pig! -Who was it? -Is that a pig? -Whose car is that? -It came out of nowhere. -Check it out! -It's the landlord. -It's him. He's got a new car! Damn! You filth! Don't you have any other means to die? Why are we watching this? Let's go. -The car is brand new! -Let's watch it. How do I use this car again? The wedding is near. Where will I buy a new one? Who can I even sell this to? Oh, my God! Heck! I shouldn't have gone to the meeting. -Looks like he will break the bonnet. -Let's leave. -It's my fault! -Sir, please look at this. -This will calm you down. -Just go away. Things have taken a turn for the worse ever since the wedding was fixed. It's a bad omen! We'll have to look at a corpse in order to make things right. Let's make a quick stop if there's a funeral in town. -An ice cream vendor died recently. -Ice cream vendor? Please wait in the car for ten minutes. I will get another car. -Where is it? -Near Kannadiputhur Main Road. -Fine, I'll walk. -Okay. The garland that they presented at the meeting is in the back. Get it. Yes, sir. -He's so shameless! -Scoundrel! -He's going to our house. -We should reach before him. Did my dad die to fix his bad luck? -We should reach before him, move. -Let's take the shortcut. Look at the scoundrel! Welcome, sir! -Welcome. -I've come to pay my respects. I don't believe in caste or religion. I give equal respect to everyone. -I take part in everyone's joy and sorrow. -Oh, wow! You're a reputable man. -You have come to my house. -Oh, that's okay. Don't expect that I would say such things. I won't show you the corpse. -He didn't die to fix your bad luck. -Hey... -Haw dare you talk that way! -What of it? Do you know what gold is? You fooled me once. Your daughter has a heart of gold. I'm not up to her standards. That's why I walked away. -We were in love. -What! Did you ask what she wanted? If you act arrogant, this is what you get. You decided to get her married to that imbecile, right? Your bad luck will follow you. Misfortune will follow you. How dare you say such things! -You will suffer! -Come quickly. -He has left us all! -Come, join the singing. He has left us all! -He has left us all! -Come, let's join. He has left us all! He has left us all! He has left us all! Let go of me! Don't come near me! I'll break your bones if you do. He has left us all! -Hello. -Parthy. The VAO and insurance checking inspector are on their way. They informed me just now. So I called to tell you. I'll ask them to come. -Okay, ask them to come. -All right. -Hey, what's wrong? -Who called? The VAO and checking inspector are coming here. What? -We're done! -What are you saying? We'll have to tell them the truth. -What are you saying? -What else can we do now? They are waiting for people to come from other places. Parthy, look at him. Hello, can you hear me? I think he is a contractor. He looks like your father, right? I don't have reception here. -I saw him earlier. But... -I'll talk to him. Do you want to reveal the truth to a stranger? He knows that the body is gone. He was there amidst the chaos. -Yet, he's quiet. I'll talk to him. - Go on. -I'll convince him. -The west coast train arrives at 5 a.m. Can you hear me? Sir! -Please come with us. -Why? -Please come with us. I'll tell you. -Why should I? -Come quickly. -What are you doing? The officers will be here soon. -Officer? -Give it to him. -You give it. -Please sit. Why should I do it? Please lie down for a while. Please, sir. What are you saying? Yes. Lie down for a while, please. -What are you hiding? -I'll explain everything in a while. -Just lie down. -You should explain. -I will. Lie down. -Lift your leg. -Cover him. -Hold on. Let him lie down. The coin shouldn't drop. Use the sandal paste. Please close your eyes. Look here, have you seen him anywhere? -Are you his son? -Yes, sir. -When did he pass away? -Last night, sir. It will be difficult, but don't worry. They can't find us. -Let's discuss in the morning. -Okay. Okay. We'll take your leave. -Get up... -Hold on! Leave the footwear. -Hey, who is this? -They are Parthy's colleagues. Sorry for the delay. The car broke down on the way. I thought you would've cremated him. Thankfully, I got a chance to look at his face one last time. Sorry, Parthy. -Hey! -My God! I can't act dead for these people. You asked me to lie down for a while. Idiots! Hey! What is going on here? I will explain later. Your car keys. -Car keys? -I will explain later. Get down. Hit him, Parthy. Hit him. Don't spare him. Where's my father? Where is he? -Tell me, where is my father? -Don't spare him! Tell me, open your mouth. Where is my father? Even if I kill you here, there won't be a case anytime soon, as this place isn't under any jurisdiction. I'll drown you right here. -Tell me! Where is my father? -What would I do with the body? Wouldn't I have demanded money if I had taken it? -I swear! -Tell the truth! Please believe me! My brother and I wanted your word. -So we put up a drama. -Drama? -How dare you! -He borrowed money! That's all I know. Run away. Otherwise, I'll kill you! -Hey Parthy... -Parthy, what happened? Stop! AELAY ICE CREAM Who's breaking the bottles! Look at him! My father's ice cream box.

Get lost! -Beat him up! -Parthy! -How dare you! -Where is my father? Tell me. -Hey! -What are you doing? -Sir, be careful. -You're here! I knew that you'll try to spoil everything. That's why I came here to pick up the groom. Did he speak ill of you? Did he ask for my daughter and create a ruckus? Your daughter? Why would he create a ruckus over her? Enlighten him. I didn't come here for your daughter. My father used to sell ice cream with this. They stole it and used it to party with some strangers. Should I keep quiet? -She was my classmate. -Be happy that I didn't break his skull! I don't want your daughter. I don't want your daughter! Get her married to this piece of shit. As if she is the only girl here. -They're my relatives. -Just come. -What's this? -Don't break the bottle. -You swore on me! -That costs Rs. 90. How dare you flirt with other women when I'm right here! -Who'll look after you when you grow old? -Don't hit me! -How dare you go sniffing for a new taste! -Let's hide. Come along. Don't be afraid of them. What will you do if I hit you like this? -You're a good girl. -Is that what you think? I'll show you. Hey! See, I will hit you badly. Hey, it hurts! They're gone. -Idiot! -Does it hurt? Hey, Naachiya. It says that you'll be enemies. Why are you doing this? They already treat us like kids in this college. -And you're acting no different. -Oh, is it? -What's your family deity? -Alagunachi Amman. -His family deity? -Arungarai Amman. I knew it! Both your family deities are enemies. This is in our blood. -You both will never be together. -I'm going to break your skull open! -I'm doing you a favor. -Let me do a favor! Wait and see! You'll be separated by a twist of fate. -I'll kill you! -Oh, no! -Aunt, surprise! -Dear, check what it is. Wow! An iPhone? Thanks, Dad. Okay, I'm going to the shop.

The college management wouldn't let us use a mobile saying that you'll telecast it. I would have looked better in that. In your camera, I look blurred. Hear me out. Only you look blurred in the entire video, right? Think about it. Your boyfriend fought with the videographer, got the tape and did this. I kept scolding the boys that they ruined the channel's image. And it's all because of you. Ask him. -What happened, Aunt? -Nothing. Do you know how much I love to dance?

I can't concentrate on my studies at home. Relatives keep visiting us. I also want some change. Please, Dad, let me stay in the hostel. -Did you talk to your mother about this? -No. Okay, dear. Have I ever said no to you? I will talk to your mother. -Bye, dear. -Drive carefully. -Okay, sir. -Call me when you reach. -When will she return? -Bid her goodbye! Naachiya! I have kept the oil and chilli powder on top. Keep those in your cabinet first. Okay? -Naachiya! -Fine, Mom. I will do it. Naachiya! You are Muthukutty's son, right? -Yes! -Get up. You want liquor? Your father skinned a cat and sold it to me as rabbit meat. Someone found out and spread the news everywhere. I had to pull so many tricks to get the sales up. Losers! Hey, no booze for you. Get out! Tell him that I kicked you out. Only then will he regret his actions. Get lost! Hey, what are you doing? Hey, come here. He is breaking the chair! Hey, come here! Sir, he passed away last night. -Who? -His father. Hey, what are you saying? Nobody informed me. Son, I'm sorry. Your dad is the reason for the growth of this place. He's my old friend. He made a mess of my business. So, I spoke out of anger. He's the reason I'm alive. When I was down with jaundice he brought the doctor at the right time and saved me. He's my savior. Son, have it. -Go away. -Please forgive me. Take this. Please take this. Hey, please give this to him. -You're a... -Go on, have it. When they sang his praise, I just felt angry! But if someone badmouths him, I lose my mind. It's my pendant! He pawned it when I was a kid. You used to wear it around your waist. I have no idea when he got it back and kept it here. I used to hide money in this place. If he had kept it here, he must've believed that I'd check someday, right? How long would he have waited? Be glad that you found it now. This is his shirt. The launderer stamps this seal to identify Dad's shirt. Hey, the bill for the flowers and the garland. -Is it with you? -I gave it to you. -What's the date today? -It's 12. Dad passed away last evening. That's 11. But the order for the garlands was placed on the 10th. So somebody knew that he was going to die. Who? Sir, get up. What happened? Who ordered this? Who gave the advance? The person said it's for a funeral. He wasn't a local. Only when I came to your house did I realize that it was for your father. Some outsider paid the advance. There was no sadness on his face. He gave the order happily. I can identify him. I can find him even if he is in disguise. Hey, stop! I said stop! If I catch you... Stop right there! He doesn't know how to climb a tree. Hey! Hey, stop. Get down! -Come down -Let go of my leg. You shameless fellow! -Won't you change? -You change. I can kill you right now! -Do we look like fools? -Hey! Remember what you did? You ate parotta and burped in my face. You paid for my insurance so that you get paid when I die. You vulture, you think I don't know anything! Go away! You better get down! I won't! I'm going to thrash you now! -Get down! -Hey! -Cheenu! -Welcome. I came all this way to get my beard shaved. Of course. Where else would you go? SALON Hey, are you a lookalike of mine? I thought something was wrong with me. He is the owner of the sweet stall. Don't you know? Sweets? Hey, did your mother sell boondhi? When my father kept supplying boondhi to every nook and corner, I suspected that there was an affair. But how did you escape my eyes for so long? I am wondering the same! How? Only our father can answer that question. What's your name? Sudhakar. But everyone calls me Leftovers. Leftovers? As a kid, I used to beg people for their leftovers. -How else would a fatherless kid survive? -He used to visit you often, right? I never knew when he would visit. He never did anything for us. He'd even take away the boondhi my mother prepared to sell. He lived his life to the fullest! But it didn't last long. He'd have lived longer if he had stayed here. He went to Andaman and passed away there. People usually go to Singapore or Qatar for work, right? Do you know why he went to Andaman? For that, you should first know about our grandfather! Ever heard of him? Yes, I know. He was a freedom fighter. He had called his British friend to play a round of cards. He was calling him out saying, "Come out, you white guy". Other Britishers thought he was staging a coup and jailed him in Andaman. But everyone thinks he is a martyr! -Is that so? -Yes. Our father wanted to visit grandfather's resting place and he also passed away. Since so many from our family went to Andaman and died there, I was curious to visit Andaman too. But no luck. I've taken a vow to visit Andaman before I die. But I haven't even been to Chennai yet. I travel to Chennai often. I have work there. I'm working hard to open a shop there. My son is in Chennai too. But we are not on talking terms. Yet, he loves me a lot. He transfers money every month. I get a receipt from the bank. But I won't withdraw it. Let him hand it over directly. Then, I'll take it! He has transferred money this month as well. See, here's the receipt. Hey, you can't withdraw this whenever you want. This is an insurance scheme. If you die, your son will get the money. If I die, will my son get the money? Yes. Ten lakh rupees. He pays only a couple of thousands. But the settlement is in lakhs. -Lakhs? -Ten lakhs. All this while, I thought my son was doing this out of affection. He never talks to me. But I hoped that there's some love left in his heart for me. There is nothing called love. Everybody needs money. And your son's plan is very clean. He shouldn't get this money. -Is there a way to stop it? -A way? The only way is that you shouldn't die. Or act like you're dead. If you do that, even you have a chance of getting that money. Will I really get it? How? You sign a document saying you borrowed money from me. Fine, even a thumbprint should work. Let's trap him. I will get the insurance money from your son and give it to you. How's my idea? Well, I can act dead until I'm getting buried but how do we trick people after that? Is that even an issue? We'll set your house on fire. When people run for their lives let's burn another body or some meat and conclude that your body got burnt. Before setting the fire, I'll distract everyone and get you out. That's it! Let's book a ticket to Andaman. Illegitimate child with illegal ways. Just drink! Were you snoring? Thankfully, there are only oldies outside. Control yourself! Shake it well. Lift his chin and feed him. Drink this juice. I have asked them to give sugarcane juice. And doze off for a while. Pour it. His son is coming from Chennai only now. He has come to see his father's cold body. Poor thing must be hurting so much. -He opened his eyes, Mom. -Oh, no! Don't say such things. His eyes opened. I saw it, Mom. -What is he saying? -He's scared of something. -Come here, my child. -Nothing will happen! We'll get some talisman to ward off the evil. Don't you worry. Brother, the petrol cans are in place. Let's finish it off secretly. When people are not around, let's bring him out and burn the shelter! Don't speak like an idiot. Did you mean burn the house? Why, idiot? Why should I hand him the money? Do I look like a martyr to you? I'll stop his breath with a pillow and finish things off. He's sleeping with bandages already. Let's finish him off and grab his money. Listen, don't think of me as a monster. He laughs at me saying that I'm illegitimate. -He laughs at my name. -That's very bad, sir! You know why I carried the byname for so long? I wanted to remember the pain I went through. Legitimate child, it seems. Let him die legitimately too! -Of course! - Yes. Let's finish it. Muthukutty left us all He has left us all I built a bier for you Oh, my sir, I built a bier for you! Hey, you... The late Muthukutty Is leaving for the afterworld Let's pray for him to rest in peace You paid for my insurance to benefit from my death, right? What? Benefit from your death? Is that what you think of me? I'll kick you! I swear I didn't pay for your insurance to benefit from it. I thought of giving you the money after five years. For how long can you ride your bicycle? I planned to fix that broken house and make you comfortable. You've done enough to repay me. But you won't get the money unless I die, right? Would I have received it even if I was alive? You didn't even shed tears when you saw me as a corpse. What have you done to deserve my tears? I thought you'll leave this nest and be happy in another. Now you're dancing as if nothing happened. Maybe if you had really died, I might have cried. Thankfully, you didn't. Please don't speak that way, my son. I didn't intend to trouble you. They conspired against me. I listened to their words and did all this. The moment I realized that my son wouldn't cry for my death I felt dead. I feel like hanging myself. But I don't have the courage. See! Gather your courage and confess your actions to the cops. Fine, I'll confess. Wash your face first. Yes, fix your dress, please. Because even if we shoot well, the groom will meddle with the tapes like he did with the dance video. It has been a year, right? I left that job and came to shoot wedding videos. To my surprise, I'm shooting your wedding. Can you wait outside, please? I'll call you. -Who are you talking about? -I'm talking about the groom. Your dress was slightly torn during the dance. He got the tape and ensured that you were not visible at all. He stayed quiet to prevent others from learning about it. When you were dancing, some guys shouted and he was really pissed off. It's his duty to protect his girlfriend's dignity. Now, he'll do it as a husband. Parthy is not the groom. Sorry! I thought he'd be the groom. I brought up the past like an idiot. I'm sorry. TRUTH WILL TRIUMPH The one who went from Earth to Heaven to sell ice cream. Our dear Android and Angry Bird and 'Mad Max' Muthukutty! Stupidity! Sir! Please forgive me, Mad Max! I-I made a mistake. Hey, you... Hey, you... Hey, stop! WELCOME TO THE WEDDING OF R VIGNESH AND L NAACHIYA Son, look at this banner. Why are you just driving away? You pushed me aside because I'm a wastrel. I deserve it. But what did she do? What are you trying to prove by acting indifferent towards her? She has decided to get married. Do you expect me to stand against her wishes? Naachiya was the only soul that truly shed tears for me. She loved you a lot and kept asking about you. I thought she would take good care of you. I don't know what happened. Now, she has decided to marry someone else. You should stop being so stubborn! What do you mean? -You're talking as if I'm avoiding her. -Aren't you? She waited at our doorstep the entire day. You shut the door and remained inside. Poor girl! She was so heartbroken! I was drunk that day. So I couldn't console her. -Did she come when I was home? -Yes. Why didn't you knock on my door? How could I have known that she was there? What have you done? Did I tell you that I was avoiding her? How would you have known? You were drunk at that time! You ruined my life by getting drunk all the time. You've ruined my life! Ever since I was a child, you brought me nothing but shame. I lost everything because of you. I've lost everything. You are here just to ruin my peace. Hey, come here. Give me that ball. My life is ruined. Naachiya, my dear! Please see this. R VIGNESH WEDS L NAACHIYA I don't want that money, son! Not even a penny. I'll go somewhere. Take the money and live happily with that girl. Ask her father for her hand in marriage. Go to their house. Did you eat something? No. Get in. She is here. What's wrong? Why are you crying? What happened? Say something. I heard that my dress was torn during the dance. That happened long ago. Why are you crying over it now? So you knew that my dress was torn? Why didn't you tell me? We didn't want you to feel bad. My God! -I want to go to Parthy. -What? -I am going to elope. -What do you mean? I'm serious. I want to go to Parthy. We are actually happy that you've decided to elope. The groom was staring at us in a wrong way. We were wondering how to tell you that. Keep wondering. Just keep wondering. That's what friends are for, right? Hey... Listen, everything is going to be fine. I promise! Don't cry, please. Let's see who stands in our way. Come with me. It doesn't matter what is in your way March on with your head held high -Did you have dinner? -I did, dear. Did you see the bride? Hello, dear! Have you applied henna? Not yet. The beautician is here. We've selected the design. -We just have to get it applied. -Okay. Let me know. Are you still tying the garland? There are more flowers inside. -Enough with the decoration. -It'll be over soon. Where will you look for him? His house? Let me visit the temple first and seek blessings. He has been lying down controlling his appetite and his other needs. -Such a difficult task! -No one doubted him. Not even when he disappeared. What are we going to tell the villagers? Buddy, how are we going to keep him safe? Do you remember Suresh from school? -Yes. -He drives a mortuary hearse. Yes, he's a friend. Shall I ask him to come? Yes, call him immediately. -Who? -Suresh. He drives a mortuary hearse for the government hospital. Hey! Why do you carry such a big sickle? Had I been a little careless, they'd have killed me. They would've finished me within a matter of seconds. It was my luck that I heard what he said. And I escaped from there. But what did I get? Nothing. My son is all alone. My dear Naachiya... She has decided to get married to someone else. You just keep watching on. Don't do any good for us. Hey, Naachiya! Uncle? Uncle? -Uncle! -Naachiya, dear! I knew it! You wouldn't have gone anywhere without telling me. When I visited you, I cried so much and wished it was all a dream. It feels like I woke up from a nightmare. My sweetheart! Forgive me, Uncle. I misunderstood your son. What's this? Don't cry, okay? I've run away from home. Ask your son to take me with him. Ayyanar, my Lord! Protector of my family! I made a mistake! Forgive me, God! I spoke rudely to you. Please forgive me! Lord Ayyanar. You're omnipresent! You have always protected my family! Buddy, just a minute. He didn't answer my call. I'll bring him myself. -We only need the van. -I'll bring the van. Naachiya is here. -Looks like she has eloped. -I hope everything goes well. Won't you talk to me? What is wrong with you? If you have a problem, say it aloud. How could you do this? Even though we didn't talk, I never thought we were separated. I never thought that you will abandon me... I believed that you'd understand my love. But you stopped talking to me altogether. -Your phone means the world now! -Don't act like you care! If I hadn't come here, wouldn't you have abandoned me? Didn't you say that you don't need me? I saw you at the riverside. You looked happy. That's why I said it. I didn't know what happened at that moment. You looked at me. A smile comes to my face when I know that you're looking at me. Our problems, my wedding, your situation... Nothing came to my mind. Parthy! What is this, darling? How could you do this? Couldn't you wait until our wedding to have an affair? What are you looking at? I won't complain to anyone. You're my investment, baby! And our business deal closes only when I tie the knot, right? How could you abandon me like this? Let's go! Parthy! -Come, darling! -Get up! -Don't touch me! -Let's go. -Let's go! -Let her go. -Thrash him, guys. -Parthy! Let go of me! -Let me go. Parthy! -Stop creating a scene. Parthy! Parthy! Come on! Help me out here! Put her in the car! Leave me! -Uncle! Parthy! -Hey! -Parthy! -Get in quickly! Parthy! Parthy... Hey... Oh, God! Parthy! Blood... Hey! Stay awake! Don't lose consciousness! Open your eyes! Oh, my God! Hold on. Parthy... Parthy! His name will resonate Across all directions Look at him closely, He is just a child at heart Someone who doesn't know The cruelty of the world Yet, he will create a fuss every day There's no comparison to his mischief And, there's no limit to it His name will resonate Across all directions Look at him closely, He is just a child at heart Wearing a dirty dhoti and colored shirts He pedals his cycle hard He drinks until he falls unconscious He breaks a sweat, day in and day out He treats every child as his own He treats everyone equally Neither is he above the poor Nor is he beneath anyone He'd steal the hearts of kids But will act as if he doesn't care He'd steal the hearts of kids But will act as if he doesn't care His name will resonate Across all directions Look at him closely... Don't worry! Lord Ayyanar will save you. Son, where is your phone? Call your friends! Hey, come quickly! -What happened? -What's wrong? -Parthy! -Parthy! -What happened? -Get up! -He is bleeding heavily! -Let's go to a hospital. -Who did this? Where is Naachiya? -I don't want to go. -Who did this? -Be careful. -Be careful. -They've beat you up badly. The situation is getting out of hand. -What happened? -One wants to use the restroom. Another guy is drunk and is adamant on seeing his face. Your sister keeps calling me. Let's go home quickly. Get in. Hey, take these away. What are you waiting for? Get started with your performance. -Stand closely! -Do it quickly. Who kidnapped you in this condition? Why did you borrow money from such heartless men? You must have gone through an ordeal! -Are you seeing all this? -Meena! -He is hearing everything from here. -Please forgive me, Dad! -Meena! -Forgive me, Dad! Forgive me, my dear. There's a traffic jam near the market. So, the car won't go through. We'll walk to the town. Wait for us at the five-road junction. Come quickly. Hey, is the rope tied properly? She'll fool us with her doll face. Everybody, please listen to me carefully. My father has donated his eyes. We received this information a while ago. We're taking the body to Madurai. -To Madurai? -Yes. We'll donate his eyes and cremate him there. If you want, you can see him one last time. -He has donated his eyes. -Such a commendable deed. I used to scold him all the time. Oh God, forgive me! My dear, don't go away The eyes should've been donated within five hours. The technology is updated now. You quench your thirst. Be careful. Move away. Suresh, hey. HEARSE -Wait for us at Pazhani bus stand. -Okay! -Dad! -Move away! -You're my precious! -Move away. Listen. -Please listen to me. -My dear! -Calm down. -What a brilliant idea! My son is smart just like me! Listen. Move away. Ramasamy is not breathing. Please come here. Check up on him. He needs help. What happened to Ramasamy? He fell down from the chair. Wait for us at Pazhani bus stand. Get going. He passed away suddenly. It's true that people who die on a Saturday don't go alone. Very true! How dare you try to kill him! I was just kidding. I was just joking. I didn't plan to kill him. I knew that he was listening. So I decided to prank him. Just for fun. The bier you've built will be going to waste. Shall we use it for Ramasamy instead? Sure, sir. Please take it! -You have a big heart. -I'll make you pay for this! Sir, were you really pretending to be dead? Of course. Hey, idiots! He has been roaming about in town. His son knows about it too. What the heck are you doing? We're trying to kill him without a trace. That is not possible anymore. Have you even killed anyone before? Don't doubt us. We have killed people before. He is taking his father away. He must have a plan. Block the van and finish him. Let the dead stay dead. His drama shouldn't be revealed. I'll finish them both and scare Meena into giving me the money. Block the vehicle. I don't trust you. I'm on my way. What the heck! Her location sharing has stopped. -They must've snatched the phone. -What's the last known location? -Narikkalpatti Meenakshi Hospital. -Narikkalpatti? It's market time in that area. All the vehicles will be stopped. They won't be able to leave. I'm certain that they will have to be there till dawn. Let's go. Yes, let's go. Sir, just a minute. -Beat him up! -Hey! -Hey! -Hit him! -Beat him up! -Hey! -Throw him on the side! -Hey! Who are you all? -Hey! -That's a railway gate. Buddy, you be there. I'll let you know if I see them. -Parthy, they're coming. -I'm not able to find them! Parthy, I've spotted them! They're here! -Parthy, be careful. -Where are you all? -Hey, Parthy! -Let me go. Stop being adamant! Come with me. Hey, Parthy! You go there. We will handle it here. -How dare you! -Who are they? -Hey! -Die! Go! I will bring Naachiya. Go quickly. Bring her. Come on! -Does it hurt? -No. Why is your father so impatient? First, tell me what you've planned for your dad. We'll take him with us to Chennai. He can travel to other places. That's his destiny. He can never come back to this place. Why is it crowded? It looks like an accident. It's a hearse. Your dad was in that van. -Stop the car. -It's your dad. -Parthy! -Hold on! -Parthy! -Let me go! I hated you I always went against you -But now that you're gone... -Sir, that's my father! I wonder why I broke down I hoped To see your good heart Why did you fade away When I finally realized the truth? Dad... I saw you Dad, I saw you. The way you handled that baby goat. You assisted the goat in labor. I was never aware of your other side, Dad. I have only seen you killing chicks. But you had this side to you as well. I only saw your bad side and kept you away. Oh, God... Dad! I could have saved you. I lost you when I was very close to understanding you, Dad. Dad, please open your eyes and look at me. Please open your eyes and look at me. I am shedding tears for you! Can you hear me? Can you see that I'm shedding tears for you? Can you see me? Please look at your son shedding tears for you! Please look at your son shedding tears for you! This is enough! What else can I ask for? This is enough, son. You've shed tears for me. I feel alive now. Dad! Block the vehicle. I don't trust you. I'm on my way. -You cheat! -You're sitting here. You! Die! Just die! Die! Sembuli, come to me! Hey, was it a wig? I knew it when you kept using the word hair in every sentence. Only those who don't have something will keep talking about it. -Yak, it seems! Yuck! -I am going to finish you! Are you trying to escape? Get inside. -How dare you! -Hey, it's me! Hey! Hey, open this. I hated you I always went against you But now that you're gone I wonder why I broke down I hoped To see your good heart Why did you fade away When I finally realized the truth? I hated you I always went against you But now that you're gone I wonder why I broke down I hoped To see your good heart Why did you fade away When I finally realized the truth? The one who birthed me Open your eyes and look at me The one who birthed me Can you hear me weep? The one who birthed me Open your eyes and look at me The one who birthed me Can you hear me sing?
