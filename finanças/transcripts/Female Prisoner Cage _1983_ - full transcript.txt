Prisoners! Start eating Directed by: Masaru Konuma Masayo has escaped... Masayo has escaped! Silence! Listen Nothing has happened, and nothing will happen In this place, you don't think You just eat, sleep and work hard until you've done your time And that's it Understand? Wonder where she is What? Where she is now Did I tell you about my cousin falling off that yacht? It was one of those upper class sex orgies you read about My cousin and his friends used to come to our house in the summer They are all doctors, students, diplomats, things like that And one day he turned up with this yacht and so we all went sailing on the lake They all started to have sex and my cousin raped me Your stories are always about being raped or having weird sex But they're all true You have got so many plans I know! But how long will it take to do them all after we get out of here? After we get out That's when... ...our second life begins! Get up! Masayo...! Damn Ah, it's so humid tonight I'll never be able to sleep Line up! Number! One, two, three, four... Right face! Forward march! Masayo...! - Did you meet your man? - No Couldn't find him? Didn't get time to look. I got caught too soon Why do we have talk out here? Let's go inside Be patient This is the only place we can talk safely Maybe your boyfriend got back together with his ex-girlfriend He's not that sort of rat We just missed each other Well, men are so devious Yeah, so I thought you should just keep on running forever... ...and never stop This is Japan, though. There's only so far you can run You must be really in love with him But aren't you tired of men? I'll keep on escaping It's better than rotting here! She's a tough girl, all right I can't wait... This will be fun Oh, excuse me. The food will be cold Let's eat and talk about something fun Come on, let's hear your exciting stories Masayo...! Let's go! And then Masayo kicked the ball like this...! And it banged right into Saeko's tits, like this... Silence! Acting like school girls You really want to cause trouble, eh? It was Saeko who started it And you... In my office at 6pm Don't think you can go on acting like this It still makes me want to scream when I remember it I was only fourteen... I didn't knowthat a man's thing could get like that I was so scared that I passed out when I saw it But my father made me hold it in my hand Told me to lick it... Lick it again And then finally... ...he took hold of it and forced it right into my mouth Fuck it! You don't have to be scared You like doing it alone, right? You think we don't know what you're doing in the dispensary? What would the wardens say if they found out, eh? Don't be afraid We only want to watch you masturbate Come on, be a good girl Woah! Nice tits... You finished already? It was a waste of time No one showed up Miwa hasn't come back yet I guess she's getting a scolding Hey, check this out I just got it today A bed catalogue This is Varroa This one's Raymond I think I like that one better It's double layered and has better springs Masayo? Oh, dear... This looks serious It's all right. I disinfected my hands Let me examine you Oh, shit! Look at that... She needs a diaper You're cute You can join our gang No, please... Don't do it... It's just you and me now I'll lick you clean Miwa! They raped me I think it was meant for me! It's all right... It's nothing Oh no! Leave me... Leave me I'm so sorry Don't tell anyone... Please What's wrong, Miwa? What's up? It's her period - Oh, OK - That's all right Kishiko... Start eating! Where's Yoshie? Still in the clinic? I thought she was a little strange today. She seemed restless Do you want to see what I got today? It's really weird. Have a look This is a Chain Letter, a grim reaper, sent to me from Okinawa It was created by the Canadian ambassador If you don't forward this letter to someone... ...a great misfortune will befall you I don't suppose things can get much worse for me - But I wonder if I should send it on - That's scary Yoshie..?! No...! Don't stop now... We heard it all... ...Kishiko I will remember this... Along with that trick you played on Miwa It was amazing. The priest and Kishiko His tongue was so long A man from Texas... ...kept this letter and died a horrible death five years later It is important that you send it on... ...within 60 hours of receiving it - Writing a chain letter is hard - So many words Who are you sending it to? I'm just writing the letter now When it's finished I'll try to remember the name of someone I hate Masayo Saito A letter came this morning It's him! What does he say? He's coming to the next visiting day! Let me see! Tatsuo Hagino. Yay...! - Smells like the outside world - It is the outside world! Why weren't you there? Were you with her? What are you talking about? You know I wasn't... It's OK... It's in the past Don't feel bad Then I'll feel bad too Sorry I really miss you I'm glad you came Now... I feel I could die happy Here... You like rice cake, don't you? Hold me Strip me Make love to me here That woman... will be leaving soon If not, tomorrow everyone will be talking about what she gets up to People here like to gossip more than anything And the priest really likes her... Don't make me feel ashamed This is all I have Soon... ...I shall be old Be quiet Not so much noise What are you doing? Get back to work! Having a good time? Masayo...? Masayo, what's up? Who wants some? The Demon Sperm Masayo...! Come on girls! Drink deep You know you like it! Shit, we have to stop them! Don't get involved. You'll be punished Stay here Stop it! Stop it! I feel... strange I'm afraid l might do something stupid It sounds crazy... ...but I was raped by two men the other day I was in so much pain. So much pain... And now my body feels like... Reality is so boring, isn't it, Miwa? I think we can come up with a more interesting story Come on, then I want to hear something more interesting Making up stories is fun It seems you've forgotten how the outside world works Nowthen... How about this...? You tell your best friend, Masayo... ...that someone informed us about her escape plans We let her remain free for a little while... ...so we could punish her when we caught her It's true, but maybe not interesting enough Who could we name as the informer? It's much more fun if we make something up But which name would be the most amusing? The summer is coming to an end soon Winter is the best season I want to swim! You're right In a place where the water is clean and cool I'll wear a bikini Don't be silly, Yoshie Blue sky and white waves... You'll be naked, right? Yeah Look out, here goes Miwa... More rubbish about swimming naked in the ocean... ...and being raped by students and doctors - Scratch there... - Where? That better? What are you doing? Dispensary Closed Hey, get up! You're not finished yet A hundred more push-ups! No slacking now, you lazy scum! What the fuck's this? I can't eat this crap Since that escape we've been treated like pigs Why should we suffer for someone else's mistake? Someone who cares more about pussy than food It used to be fun in here Now we all hate each other Masayo...! There's a rumor going round I heard it from a guard, so I think it's true Just listen to this... Someone informed on your escape plan The warders knew all about it even before you'd gone But there's even worse to come Apparently your boyfriend was bribed to come and visit you so that you'll miss him even more and try to escape again They'll catch you and beat you up... ...to make it a lesson to other prisoners That day, when your boyfriend Tatsuo made love to you in the visiting room They knew all about it and were laughing at you behind your back After that, Tatsuo received money Listen... ...I hate to tell you this This is really the worst bit You know who the informer was? It's awful It was... Yoshie! I wanted you to hear all this from me I'm sorry Where's Masayo? I wonder what happened Yoshie Wait here Go to hell, Masayo. Go to hell, Masayo... This time you went too far You really going to suffer now We have special punishments for each of you Such great bodies deserve punishing Nowthis woman is a real lesbian She'll wash out her cunt... ...every time a man even goes near it A sad excuse for a woman That was the cause of her crime Her hatred drove her crazy, and she stabbed a man to death What a very perfidious priest you are I was hoping for someone like you to come along The more I love someone, the more I want to hurt them I really want you to lick my feet No! Very well Let's make your pretty face a little uglier After all, you are my pet dogs So... Come on, wag your tails and yelp all you want That's what I'm dying to see What are you doing? Stop it! Stop! Why are they being punished and you are not? That is the question you are all asking Each of you has done something good for me All good acts, we reward with love. Understand? The earth is filled with love? On those who have big hearts, love will shine all day... ...like bright, strong sunlight Chain Letter I'll try to remember the name of someone I hate... You've become quiet and obedient You can finally enjoy being my pet dog Masayo... I respect your bravery and courage In five minutes, you will be freed from here Who knows where this darkness will lead... ...butjust run fast This is what you call freedom We will start hunting you as soon as you are free from here My beloved Masako... My last gift to you is lying at your feet The End
