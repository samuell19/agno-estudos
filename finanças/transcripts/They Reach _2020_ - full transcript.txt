You're right. That wasn't your mom years ago, I documented my father's studies. He was studying the case of a disturbed boy. We had no idea what we were in for. We need to leave. Let's go. Let's get out of here right now. Father, look, I don't know what's going on. Shut up. How long has that been there? Just fear. Can we move it? Don't touch him. What do you mean? Sound Gwen? Guamanian Timonium. It must possess the Mark one, right? We'll just, just take Michael and get the hell out of here. No, this might not be Michael. He can take the shape of the marked one or those closest to the marked one. The sanguine demon can only inhabit our bodies for a short time. It wants your son as its vessel. Life it craves life. This is something it does not have. So what do we do? The only normal way is to sacrifice, to sacrifice the vessel just after possession. What talking about killing a child in front of the boy. Don't touch him in the name of the father, the son, the Holy ghost. Lord strengthened my soul cast out by demons to hell. Be the wicked perish at the presence of God. Let's get outta here. Father The church came in and cleaned everything up, took away all our equipment and a crate. Wait, hold on. What if somebody kind of maybe accidentally, definitely has Mark on her.

You've got to find your family, man, pure light organic light light of mother earth. This repels the evil question. Is this thing ever going to stop? No, it won't stop. It's building power. What do you mean? It feeds on souls until it's strong enough to possess the Mark. Wonder how do we kill it? You can't game over, man. Not necessarily. There was something about something about a doorway. Here it is for Nellum ostium quote or something like that. It's Latin. The final doorway is the backwards door that doesn't make any sense backwards. Okay. Okay. I don't get it. What door is it going through to get here? It's not a door door. I mean, it could be a door or an old book, a possessed doll, Weegee board. That's kind of cliche. Yes. Give me the back. Why, what about. Boring, but it could be. What about this giant stupid spork? Why do you have that? What about, um, my lucky yoyo cheddar, we need to be serious. Any item can be a doorway. All it needs to open or close is blood. We're solid, right? Cause mother's candles are keeping us safe. We need to leave now. Nobody's here. This is some weird shit. This like the romance section. She what happened? That's when I followed you around. You can't go back. We have to get to the church. We'll be safe there. Well over Jessica, Jessica. Jessica, Jessica it's playful. My mom don't have time for that. The reason we can figure this out. There has to be a better way. We can. Hello, Jessica, can you hear me? Can anyone hear me anything yet? No, we're going to find them. Let's go. There's someone on your walkie. This is Jessica come in over. Oh, thank God Jessica. Yeah, it's me. I'm here. What are you born on James street? Don't move. We're on our way. We have to get out of this car. Sacrifice the Lord, my God strengthened my soul. Hey, what's the plan? Go to our house. Just join the wants blood. Sacrifice, you need to listen to her. I know how to send it back. The final tour with Charlie. Where's the real surreal Oh shit. The doorway, it was here. It was right here. Listen, we need to find this damn doorway bleed on it and send this thing back to hell all the dead bodies and close the door on your way out. Just keep looking. No behind me. Jessica it's the pure light. It hurts it, it does something to it. How much time does it? We have a dozen potatoes, maybe five minutes, five minutes. Is that all we got? There's a bag in the shed. No, dad. No. Be very careful with it. Slight district will disrupt this connection. One, maybe two minutes. How do I turn it off? It's the switch, but only when you're ready. Charlie can't go. You can't carry that light and the potatoes at the same time. No Coming back. You got a dance to go to Come on. Let's go. Jessica. Find the doorway. It's dying, Charlie. Jessica. Yeah, I can fix this. We have the potatoes and the real, and they can fix it. You can do anything. You too, right? Michael. I'm dr. Quinlan. Are you. Are you okay? You take it, uh, uh, just for you. Okay. I saw that guy. He, I don't know how he miss you. I was, I was at your house. Um, you weren't there. I thought I'd bring you something to cheer up. I'm sorry about your brother. Are you?
