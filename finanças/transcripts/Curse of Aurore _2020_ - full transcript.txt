Hey guys, welcome back. I'm Casey Nolan with MindSeed TV, the YouTube channel for all things horror and scary related. Now, as some of you may know, we've opened up cursed items here on the channel, we've done our own paranormal investigations, and we've even opened up the infamous dark web mystery boxes. For those of you watching this the first time, there are people on the dark web who put items into boxes and sell them and they're called mystery boxes. Now, nobody knows what kind of items that these boxes are going to contain, but each one that I've opened up here on the channel in the past has contained very disturbing things. Some of these items that I've found inside these boxes were so compelling to be evidence of crime scenes that I actually had to turn them into authorities. Last year, I opened up a very interesting and disturbing box that contained all sorts of strange items inside. I found leaves, blankets, and all sorts of other weird stuff. There were tarot cards, a beanie with a hole in it, and even a little bag containing a girl's hair that looked like it had been ripped from her scalp. It had blood still in the hair and maybe what was even a piece of skin attached to it. I still don't know what any of these things actually mean, but the reason that I'm revisiting it today in this video is because this doll right here, which I found inside the box, had a USB drive attached to its neck. Now, I believe that whatever is on this USB drive might contain some of the answers as to what all those items meant inside the box. However, when it comes to these USB drives, you never know who is sending this to you and if it might have a virus or something on it, so you have to be really careful when plugging this into your home computer. Luckily, I was able to pick up a burner laptop, and we're going to go ahead and plug this in today and actually see what's on this thumb drive. But before we do, I would like to mention, you never know what you're really going to get. And sometimes you might see things on here that your eyes just can't take back. So with that being said, let's go ahead and take a look today. Fingers crossed. Here we go. Dan-gér. It's pronounced "dang-er". Yes, you are the international - man of dan-gér. - I know 'em all. That's right, we're gonna be fine. Oh, you are so polité. Polite? You don't have to film everything. Have you met me or... Wish I hadn't. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay. Huh, kinda empty. Alright, this is Kev-Mo in Canada. Is it Québec? I think so, yeah. - It's cold. - If you pronounce... Oh, here she is, writer, actress, producer, Miss Lena Carpenter. Lena: Oh my God. Oh my God. Welcome to Canada! - Hello, hello! - Is that a cane? - Oh careful, careful. - I'm sorry. No, it's fine, it's fine. - You're here! - Yeah. Well, hug me later, I got the camera. Okay, do I look okay? You look great, yes. - Are we doing this? - We are doing this. alright. What is all this with the leg? Just new fashion. We're good, I'll tell you about it in the car. - Hey, come on. - Should you even be driving a car? Yeah, I got here. No, I'd like not to die so maybe... Okay, you can drive. - Thank you, okay. - How about that? You're the soccer mom. If you guys need to make any phone calls though, you gotta do it now 'cause it's a dead zone 'til we get there. Dead zone. We are getting deeper into the Québec countryside. - Ooh la la. - That's right. I cannot believe you guys are here right now. Kevin, I've been telling Aaron to come up here for probably, what, 10 years? - Something like that? - Yeah. - And here you are. - And here I am. In the flesh. - I'm stoked. - Lena: Me too, this is it. We're doing it. So what exactly happened with your leg? Oh, yeah. So you know how I came up here a couple weeks ago? I told my mom I was gonna fix up the house a little bit while I'm here. - Yeah. - Don't tell me you fell off a ladder. Well... - You, what? - Actually, no. Well okay, let me explain. So there was a leak in one of the bedrooms upstairs, so I got up on a ladder and I was patching it up and I mean, yeah. I fucking fell off the ladder, dude. Fuck, Lena, is it broken? No, it's not broken. It's just a torn ACL. - A torn ACL? - Yeah. That's so bad. My brother tore his ACL once playing football and he couldn't walk for six weeks. Well obviously this isn't that bad 'cause I'm walking. Limping, but I'm walking, okay? And don't be pissed, Aaron, because this isn't gonna stop us from writing the fucking script, dude. Yeah, I find that hard to believe. Why didn't you tell us about this? Well 'cause... It doesn't matter. Look at all this nothing. Ooh, a detour, that's exciting. Ooh, want to go down that spooky road? - Nope. - Kind of. Maybe we can film down there. Maybe midnight we'll be back. I really did miss you guys. We finished our feature a whole fucking year ago. I really have a good feeling that we're gonna sell it. I mean, I've had how many conversations now? - Four, 10, - LENA: Four conversations - 30. - With sale reps. I know, feels like 30. And they're all telling me that our film is highly marketable. I just feel good about it. I think something's gonna happen. Yeah, I hope so. I mean, you spend three fucking years working on a feature and until it sells, it doesn't even exist. Yeah, exactly why we need to get started ASAP up here. ♪ Kev-Mo in Canada ♪ Oh, those are some beautiful Betty Davis eyes you just gave me, oh yeah. Hey, how's your new gig going? Uh... It's going. I'm already thinking about switching careers. - Seriously? - Maybe professional sports. Is it that bad? I sit in a windowless office for 12 hours a day, so. Well, you'll love it up here. I mean, there's tons of fresh air. - It's true. - Chilly air. Plenty of windows. I mean, just think of it like you're paying your dues. It's just a starting point. I know, I'd just rather be doing this with you guys all the time. Aw, did you hear that? If only you paid money. Here it is, you guys, moment of truth. Your first legit Québec poutine. - I'm going in. - Oh my gosh. - I'm going in. - Yeah, you are. Yeah you are, do it, do it. Look at that, look at those curds. - Perfect bite. - Mm-hmm. Well, what do we think? It's pretty fucking good. Yeah, of course. - A little sweet. - Yeah. - A little savory. - Yeah. Perfect stoner food. I agree. Yeah it's, but wait, no, no, no. Take just one cheese and eat it because - it squeaks in your mouth. - One cheese. - Yeah, just... - What do you mean it squeaks? Just do it, you'll see. Enjoy the squeak. Am I right? I get it. It's weird. Yeah, deliciously weird? It's squeaking, yeah. It's squeaking. alright, save me some, I'm starving. Have as much as you want. Okay, okay, mmm. So do you miss California at all? I mean, yeah, I miss you guys. I miss working on a project. But North Carolina is beautiful and it beats the LA smog, so. And the LA earthquakes. Oh my God, yeah, you guys just had a really big one, right? Yeah, guess where I was? - LAX. - No you weren't. Yeah, I was at the terminal about to get on a flight and people started freaking out. It was like... trapped in a box. Oh my God, that's a nightmare. I mean, LAX any day is a nightmare but on earthquake day. It was scary, my first big one. - Your first big one? - Yeah. Aren't you like 85 years old or something? Yeah, I'm 85 exactly, yeah. Yeah, I don't think there's earthquakes up here though, so you guys should be good. - There's one good thing. - Might get some snow. But... um... Yeah. So what happened with you and Mark? I don't know. Nothing, I guess. He's still in LA and I'm in North Carolina, so. So, like, that's it? Yeah. Told you guys if we got up far enough, you'll see the snow. Is that what this is? Alright so, tomorrow. I want to take you guys to a couple different location possibilities. There's the church and the cemetery. Well, we still don't have a script yet. We're still figuring out the story. Didn't you read the stuff I sent you? Yeah, does it include a script 'cause... Dude, did you read the stuff I sent you? Neither of you read the stuff I sent you? We read some of it, we just didn't... Okay, okay, so. In 1920, there was a little girl here, okay? Her name was Aurore. They call her the child martyr. Aurore l'enfant martyre. Because she was murdered by her parents - at 11 years old. - Jesus, shut up. Yeah, yeah. And I guess they were abusing her pretty severely her entire life and they found her, someone found her in her bedroom, being eaten by rats on a pile - of her own excrement. - Fuck. I don't remember that part. Yeah, no, it was, it's gross and sad and it was a really big story obviously when it happened. It's still talked about today. So if you were to ask any of the locals about Aurore l'enfant martyre, they know exactly who she is. Yeah, it's interesting, it's fucked up, it's tragic, but that's the history, not the script we're writing. Okay, so. alright, so what I'm thinking is that we do sort of a modern day something haunting that has to do with Aurore. - Okay, we could... - Oh my God, oh my God! This is too creepy 'cause right now... Jesus, you scared me. I'm sorry. - This is the sign. - And there she is. Fortierville, this is the town where she died. - Okay - Right here, see? - Alright. - Creepy. I get goosebumps when I come through here. But my family's cottage is just, it's kind of the next town over, so we're almost there. Hope it's not that far 'cause... So just past that kinda green house to the left. See the one with the stones on it? - Oh yeah. - That's my family's - heritage house. - Ooh. It's been in our family for over 100 years. Cool little place. Kinda creepy, to be honest. I can't wait for you guys to see the inside. Come on. Come on in, my dears. This is the living room. Yeah, cool, how about the bathroom? Oh, go. Oh wait, wait, shoes, shoes, shoes. - Okay, are you shooting? - Sure am. alright, so this is obviously the kitchen. See how low the counters are for my little relatives? Yeah, I see how normal sized the counters are for your normal sized relatives. Don't be mean. There he is, hey. Why are you filming me? 'Cause we're taking the tour. Yeah. Bathroom's nice. Thanks. Maybe want to not go in there for a few hours. Oh, gross. I feel like that's kind of, there's not a whole lot going on down here. - Hmm, yeah. - It's kinda small. I guess it is smaller than I thought. Yeah. I bet you hear that a lot though. What's with all the crucifixes? Say what now? The crucifixes, why are there so many crosses? Well, I mean, everybody's Catholic here. I mean, you gotta have a Jesus when you walk in. Come here, come here, I want you to see this. Fine. So these old houses all have these hatches in them. It keeps the heat down when no one's upstairs and they are heavy as fuck. - See if you can lift it. - So you're saying, saying I can't do it? I mean, I just kinda want to see if you can 'cause my four foot great-grandmother can. Come on, channel your inner four foot grandmother. Do it! He's got it, come on. Seems like it's gonna open and then it doesn't. Oh, he thought he was so strong - but he's not. - Come on, LA Fitness. Do it, yeah, alright! Okay, okay, see at the top there's these little latches? To lock? - Yeah. - Yep, just. Okay, so this is what my family calls the pink room. - Ooh. - So pretty. Why do you call it the pink room? One of you guys can sleep in here if you want to. Alright. I'm good, actually. No? I'm definitely getting creepy little girl vibes in here. Well, I like the pink. It matches my vibrator. - Oh my God. - Ew, really? - Don't shame me. - Really? I'm gonna check out this... - Oh. - Giant closet. So Kevin just found "Closet-Land". - Okay. - You gotta see this. Go on in. What do you mean "ClosetLand"? It's like a maze to other rooms. - Really? - Yeah, seriously. - You coming? - Dude, light. We need your light. It's nice to be needed. - Okay. - Yeah, keeps going. - Interested. - Yeah, we have... - Oh, there we go. - Old magazines and old jewelry. It's my great-grandmother's stuff. - It's a Bible or something. - Cool, dope. - Did he just take that? - I think so. Kevin. You're sleeping in the closet, dude. What the fuck? - Oh boy. - Aaron. What's up? Will you be my wedding videographer? - Don't fuck another - For me and my Lamp dude. - groovy boo She is pretty. This is definitely my room. - Really? - Yeah. Is that cool with you, Aaron? I'm totally cool with it. - Alright. - Yes. - Comfy? - Looks good on him. - A little light reading. - You should be careful with that book. I don't think it is a book actually, Lena. Turns out it is... a place to hold... - Yeah, that's... - A bag of hair! I was trying to say that. So this is from my great-grandmother's wake. Okay. Before my time, but these were the candles they burned and this is... Weird. A bag of her actual hair - Not good. - That they wanted to keep. So my family's weird. - Yep. - No, no, if I had hair, I would keep it in a book. But maybe that's why you shouldn't just take things, Kevin. - Dude. - I don't even, I'm speechless, it's a bag of hair. You still want to take this room? Yes, but please remove the book. No, you're sleeping with that hair. I'm putting it under your pillow. But look, it takes you back to where we started. So you don't have to come through the closets. - Oh, okay. - Yeah, so. - I see now. - Safe land out here, Kevin. - Yeah, got it. - So yeah. That's pretty much upstairs. But who wants to see the creepy basement? - Creepy basement! - Creepy basement! Let's do it, let's do it, come on. Alright, be very careful going down. They're old rickety stairs. I think you need to be careful going down. I think your mom needs to be careful going down. - Whoa. - Spooky! That was unnecessary. Come on, pussies. Get down here. Watch your head when you get down though. Okay. Super low ceilings. Oh, somebody's necklace. It's not a necklace, it's a rosary. What is a rosary? You don't know what a rosary is? It's Catholic prayer beads. Oh well, I'm a Jew, so that's probably why. This could be a cool spot to film something. Right? Once we actually have something to film. Dudes, I don't know. Kind of getting weird, freaky vibes. Are you scared, Kevin? And it's freezing cold. - Yeah, it's a basement. - I'm just uncomfortable. He's uncomfortable. Oh, that's totally normal. - What? - I don't know. Why do you have that? I don't know. People don't come up here very often. This little room... Oh, is it your family's secret torture room? Funny. This is where my great-grandmother used to keep her homemade jarred goods. Jarred heads, probably. Yeah, maybe it is a torture chamber, Kevin. Want to go in there? No, you could not pay me enough money to sit in that chair. He's gone, he's just done. You want to go in there, Aaron? Oh no, I think you should ask Kevin again. He seemed to be on the brink... - Kevin. - Of changing his mind. Are you okay, dude? Yeah, cool little home office. What's wrong with him? How's he sleeping like that? I know, really. Oh, wait. All we had to do is film him and he stopped. Keep filming. You and I can finally go to sleep. Seriously. Oh, did you hear that? No, hear what? Quiet. Yeah, either I'm really, really high or the wind just stopped. No, it stopped. Here, hold this. What is it? There's people over here. - Really? - Yeah, it's weird. Check it out. - I don't see any... - No, right here. The neighbor's house. Whoa, that's weird. Do you think they're having Bible study or something? It's one in the morning. - Christ! - Oh dude. Fuck, Aaron. You suck at sleeping. What's going on? - Oh my God. - There's people outside. What are you doing? There's people. Look. Get up. I don't see anything. They're gone. - Seriously? - Yeah. That's so weird, they were just right there. Yep. We were filming you snoring, by the way. Oh. Fuck you guys. Let's go, come on. It's cold. Get ready to practice your French. Okay What is he saying? I don't really know. Yo, dude. They got milk in bags. It's the metric system, man. There's three bags to a gallon. Oh look at that, 3%, 10%, 15%. - They got 35%. - Oh my gosh. That's almost half. Turkish Delight Loukoum? Canadian beer... - -is free. - What? Kevin, what the fuck are you doing? Kevin! Pardon, put it back, man. It's an entire aisle dedicated to preservative packed mini cakes. Those actually look amazing. Okay, okay. We should stop. Kev-Mo, you look so domestic. Aaron, I look "bro-mestic". Okay, guys. So I want you to be intimately familiar with the story here. Great. So this little girl, that's Aurore, the martyr. - Got it, okay. - Okay, got it? This is the very happy family photo. Not creepy at all, yeah. - Great. - Okay. And we have Telesphore Gagnon. Okay, he's the father. And we have Marie-Anne Houde, the stepmother. And these guys were cousins. Yikes. A lot of that went on up here. So fucking messed up. Yeah. Kevin: Who wants more wine? Oh yes, thank you. - Aaron? - I'm good, thanks. Perfect, thank you, thank you. - That's it? - Yeah, yeah. So basically, terrible people. Especially this woman, Marie-Anne Houde. She's the original evil stepmother. She would burn Aurore with the fire poker and starve her and shit just, ow. So basically pure evil. - Yeah. - Like Kev-Mo. Yeah, so after Aurore dies, there's this trial. And Telesphore gets sentenced to life and Marie-Anne gets sentenced to hanging. - Right, yeah. - Right, yeah. Yeah, except that both of them end up getting released for various reasons and get to live out their days. - Just free people. - Yep, yeah. Oh, so there's never any real justice for Aurore. No. None, not at all. So alright, what I'm, I'm thinking about this from kind of a spiritual standpoint and it's like... Unfinished business. Absolutely, yes, yes. And so I think that's the foundation for the script. Alright, yeah, I want to hear more. But first, I gotta piss. So glad this shit is legal up here. I know, and it's good too. Oh yes. - Alright, Aaron. - Yep. Whoa, my God, dude. Chill. Every time. Are you okay? - Such a lightweight. - What is happening to you? - You want more? - Of course. I just had an idea for a story idea. Oh my God. - Someone's really high. - Kevin, Kevin, take the camera. What, that kind of idea? - Yep, yep, yep. - Someone's high. - This is it, this is it. - Alright. No, no. Yes, yes, I am high, but that's not the point. Okay. Okay 100 years. Since the death of Aurore. A child is murdered by her parents who are possessed by evil spirits. Ooh. Like the evil spirits of Mary Anne and Telesphore Gagnon? - Sure, yep, them. - Yeah, yeah. - Yep, them. - Alright, alright. I'm okay with that. I think it's good. Cool, shut the gate. We're done. Roll credits. Yes. Invite friends and family to the screening so we have people in the seats. I have an idea, I have an idea. I have an idea. Alright, so. Like he said, 100 years after Aurore died. Why are you laughing? Sounds derivative. I feel like I've heard this one before. There's children going missing here, now though again, and because of a copycat killer. A coffee cup killer. What, cup? No, no, wait, I got one. - I didn't say coffee cup. - You say coffee cup killer? Alright, remember that idea that we had awhile ago? Wait, which one? Which one? The one where it was like a cult town? Oh yeah. And they were harvesting human bodies. That's good though. Think about the lady that we saw today at that store. She would make the best cult person. What did you just say? Did you say cult person? Aaron: What is that? What is a cult person? I don't know. Kevin: Yo, deal with it. I'll get it. Fix it, fix it. Director, direct the music. Knobs within knobs. - Come on. - Okay. That thing's dead. Sorry, I tried. Calling it. - Come on, man. - I did not promise the technology in this house would be very good. We need "tune-age", - come on! - Stream something! Oh, okay. Okay, hold on, let me pull something up here. "Tune-age". - Oh. - Try AM. I think the wifi is dead, you guys. Alright. I'm gonna reset the router. You know one of us can do that, right? Yeah but it's fine, I'm right here. All: Oh fuck! You gotta be kidding me. Are you serious right now? What the fuck? What? What happened? I think it just locked when it fell down. - No. - Does that happen often? You can't lock it from inside. And no, this has never happened. Alright. Oh, actually, that was really easy. - Alright. - It just opened? - What the fuck? - That's really weird. You got the latch okay? Yes, there you go. Can you check to see if there's a window open or something, or maybe a draft blew it closed. I don't know why this would do that. Yeah, sure, I'll go be the hero and check it out. - Thank you, Aaron. - Alone, by myself. Freaked out. - What was that? - What the fuck? Aaron. Aaron. It's not funny. Did you find something? What the hell? Aaron, come on. - Aaron! - Aaron! Come on! Aaron. - Aaron - Kevin: Fuck! - Aaron! - God. Fuck you guys. Dude, I'm too high for this shit. Not one of you assholes even asked if I was okay. The one scene, that one permit, would've cost more than the entire film. So we had to go guerrilla. Just one actor, DP, director, that's it. - Wow. - You get the shot? We got a shot. I mean, the director wasn't totally happy but... See that's why shooting here is gonna be so awesome. It's not like LA where you need a permit for everything. I feel like we'll just be able to roll up to a place and just go. That's great. Here's our first location, my friends. - This is the church. - Yeah, this is what we're gonna check out. So you can just go into this parking lot right here to the right. And yeah. This church is over 100 years old. Yeah, I can tell by the phone booth in front of it. Is it locked? I don't know. It's not locked. - Let's go to church. - Yeah. Churches are friendly, welcoming places. Here we go. It's warm at least. Oh, don't slam the door on the camera. Sorry. Check out all the local art. Wood carvings. That's cool. Isn't it beautiful though? It is, yeah. Must be a lot of farmers. Aaron: Oh, wow. Yeah, you gotta look at the ceilings. - Wow. - So nice. Stations of the Cross. Some things are universal. En francais. Oh, I speak English. Oh, Okay. Good. Well we're here because we're looking to film here in the church at some point in the near future. Hold on a second, hold on. I think this is someone I'm related to. The priest's watching us. Where? He's over there. So much for filming everywhere. He can't say anything. I mean, we're paying our respects. Fucking freezing. I want you guys to see if you can find Aurore's grave. I'm not gonna tell you where it is. You'll know, you'll know when you'll see it. Wonder if they're related to our friend Aurore. Yeah. And no one ever heard from Kev-Mo again. I remember my first Mail Hot account. I'm a Mail G guy myself. Oh shit. Telesphore. Aaron! Oh, you found it. It's amazing that she died 100 years ago and people still leave her all these toys. I think I know this girl. Chantal? Lena? Oh my God! Hey, Kevin, it's nice to meet you. Aaron. It's okay, my English is not so bad. - Oh, okay, good. - Mine too. We would like to do a film about Aurore. Wow. You know, my uncle lives at the house where she died. For real? - Yeah. - Seriously? Yeah, it's not that far away. Oh my God, do you think you could give us directions so we could check it out? - Sure. - Let me get a pen. Aaron: Poor little guy. I bet he used to have a whole bunch of fly friends. And they all abandoned him 'cause they'd rather be smoking pot. Snow day. See, this is kinda more what I was expecting. Shit happens fast up here. Camera likes you. Thank you, Aaron. It's so cold. Do I look like an angel? Do you see that? - Don't break it, don't ruin it. - Sorry, sorry. - Did you get this? - It's beautiful. Just created art. Yeah, just looks like a bunch of white stuff. There's no lake out here, is there? That we're walking on and we're gonna... Yeah, you're on one right now. - Oh yeah, very funny. - You don't hear the cracking? It's snowing. I don't know what to do. Such a baby, so sensitive. I've never felt more alone. Hey, hey, don't run with the camera. - I'm not. - He's frolicking. How do you tell if someone from LA is cold? I don't know, Aaron, how do you tell? Oh, he'll tell you. How far are we allowed to go this way? Our property ends at the tree line. And then the rest of that belongs to a farmer, I think. Get some air, dude. - Let's get some air. - Oh my God. You guys are so cute together. Almost looks like you're standing in front of, on a lake that's frozen. Yeah. - An old, cool house. - It's all sunken in. I would not want to get lost out there. Always a shame that the moon never looks as good as it does in real life. It's so pretty tonight. I heard there's a streetlight around here. That flickers every night at the same time. Not around here, I don't see any streetlights. - I know. - Much less a haunted one. I feel like maybe we went too far. Well, if you want me to turn around, tell me to turn around. I don't know. Keep going for now, I guess. So I got a burning question. Are all priests assholes? Some. Yeah, I'm kinda weirded by the Catholic church. Never liked going much as a kid. It's not my scene except for the Latin chants. You know what, you guys, this is definitely not right. Whoa, there's a snow twister. Look at that. Kevin, you getting this? Hell yeah I am. That thing is awesome. It looks like a ghost. I feel like we went too far for sure. She said it was just - a couple of miles. - I'm down to go home. Let's turn around. Alright, this might take awhile because somebody rented a minivan. Yeah, be super careful with these ditches on both sides. Yeah, precious cargo. Don't worry, Kev. Look at this cornfield. Baby on board. Watch the ice, man. Easier to watch the not ice. - Alright, here we go. - How do people even live out here? The only thing that I care about is that we don't get lost in the middle of nowhere on a freezing night. Holy fuck, Aaron! Oh my God. Are you fucking kidding me, Lena? There was a girl. - You almost hit her. - I didn't see shit. Kev? I don't know. Fuck. I'm not messing, you guys, there was a girl. Save it. - Son of a bitch. - Are we stuck? - Dude, where are you going? - Aaron. Fuck. - What is he doing? - Fuck! Raging out. Really, really, really sorry, you guys. You always take it too fucking far, Lena. Just fucking relax, I have triple A. They don't have triple A up here, man. And we don't have reception, so. God Damn it Great, so. It's dark and I'm freezing my nuts off and I have to go to the fucking bathroom and we're just stuck in this ditch? - I swear, I saw something. - Can we just find a way to go home, please? Seriously. There's a house down here, alright? We'll just, we can ask for help, alright? Seriously? I'm not going alone, come on. This is how people get murdered. You're not gonna get murdered. You can't promise me that. Come on! Do not wanna walk down this road. She's fucking stubborn. We should just let her... Come on, we can't let her go alone. - Goddammit. - Come on! Okay, please be home. My toes are just gonna crack off. Weird red lights. Oh, goddammit. Smells weird. Kinda like incense or something? Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. We got in an accident You don't speak English, okay. - So we slid on the ice. - We need help. Blanche! Heard him say "anglais", I think. Hello. English? Oui, can I help you? Okay, thank you. So we slipped just down here on the ice. We went into a ditch - kind of thing. - We need a tow truck. Oh, tow truck, oui. - Come inside, yes please. - Okay, thank you so much. Thank you, thank you. Yes, come in, come in. Benoit's cousin Marc has a tow truck. Wow, really? You alright? He's gonna see if he can get the tow truck. Oh my God. - That was Benoit. - That's amazing, thank you. Hey, what's up, Kevin. Oh, the American, yes. You are the filmmakers obviously. Oh we're famous, huh? Well I don't know about the States, but around here, people pay attention. What are you filming? Oh. Well, we're thinking about doing a horror movie. Maybe a local haunting story. - How exciting, yeah. - Thanks. We're excited. You're into that stuff, huh? Yes, I do enjoy it. I'm a bit of a, how you say, spiritualist. Oh! Yes, as you can see, I do tarot card readings for my friends. Beautiful. What happened to you? Oh, just stupid, minor injury. Oh well please, sit down. Well speaking of hauntings, we have had a few here in Sainte-Sophie. - Really? - Mm-hmm. Has anyone ever seen a girl walking in your field? Come on, Lena. I know what I saw, you guys. Because when we were driving, I swear I saw this little girl, and we've been researching Aurore l'enfant martyre. Let me stop you there. Aurore's story is... What is the word? Delicate. The people in this town don't like when people make fantasy of a tragedy Oh, we definitely don't want to make light of it. Oh no, not at all. It's a nice fire. Well, I'm quite certain there are no little girls running around in my field in the middle of November. Lena: Oh, okay. Hey, can I use your bathroom? Yes, through the kitchen to the right. I'd be happy to do a card reading for you, if you'd like. - Really? - Yeah, please. I would love that. - Be my guest. - Thank you. I guess it's what we're doing. That's super cool. And what exactly do you hope to get out of this? Go with it, Aaron. - Inspiration. - Please. I need some quiet. Okay, sorry. You can take your jacket off, Kev-Mo. What would you like to know? Oh. I don't know. Will our movie sell? Okay. The film that we finished, will we sell it? Tarot cannot tell us everything but let's see what the cards have to say. This card means the world. Facing this way, it means completion, fulfillment. Yes, we are aware we finished the movie. Hmm. Well, death doesn't always mean death. Sometimes it means a new beginning. New movie? New beginning? Is it always so bleak? More new beginnings maybe? Tarot is not a game. I thought it was just one death card in a deck. What is it? That's fucked. What does that mean? Lena: Nice guy. What'd he say? He said to be careful and then I think something about maybe don't be stupid. These roads suck. We already got in one accident too many tonight. Yep, no more ditches, no more ditches. Drive slowly, please. Check it out. Languages of the Dead, what is that? Nabbed us a little "souvie". You stole from them? - Why would you do that? - Kev. They just helped us. We're writing a horror script. I thought it'd be useful. You can't just take things, dude. It was the only book they had in English. Kevin, really? - I don't read French. - Fuck, Kevin. Get your shit together. Fuck you, Aaron. No good? She pulled three death cards. Oh my God, please don't tell me you're still thinking about that. Was kind of fucked up. See? So what, you die three times? Is that what you believe, like we're a fucking cat with nine lives or something? There's three of us, Aaron. - Three death cards. - Don't say that. Don't fall for her bullshit, Kev. Lena, seriously, we're not here to do tarot card readings and chase the ghosts in your head. You didn't think that was good inspiration for what we're doing? Because when we shoot this, I'm thinking that we... Why don't you just direct this? Here we go. That's not fair, Aaron, you know I don't want to direct. Yeah, you always say that and then you always try anyway. So maybe this time, you should just write and direct what you want. Are you fucking joking right now? You clearly don't trust my judgment. It's the Lena show every fucking time. And I'm tired of it. Hey, I got an idea. Why don't you guys just fuck already? Turn off the fucking camera. Dude, she's super pissed. Yeah, you certainly didn't help things, did you? When are you gonna get your shit together and just tell her how you feel? You really think she would want to, you're fucking filming me right now? Whoa, the church looks awesome at night, dude. What the fuck? Another one a.m. meeting. Aaron. Aaron, they have candles Holy shit, I wonder if they do this every single night. - Aaron. - Hmm? Dude, are you even listening? I'm booking an early flight back. You're doing what? I'm not into any of this, to be honest. Feels like a waste of time. Holy shit, man, you're not into any of this? It's so cool up here. Lena. Lena! Lena? Is your leg okay? Come on. - It's fine, I fell on my ass. - Let me get you up. We heard it. Put the camera away, Kevin. Chill. Hey, guys. - What's up? - Hey. Having a little solo Lena party in here? Yes, I'm celebrating, you guys. Really? You should be too. Uh-huh, and what is the occasion? You were right. About everything, all of it. None of it matters, none of it. You were right. - Wow. - Look. I'm sorry, hey, I'm sorry. For what I said before. I was frustrated and a bit out of line. But I don't think all of this is worthless. I don't. But it is. It's all worthless. It's total bullshit. I mean, we've been doing this forever and no one cares. And I'm not in my twenties anymore. Which is fine. But now I got this thing with my leg. I'm like the crazy old lady at the nursing home. Come on, Lena, stop. You know you're crazy talented. So very nice. You're very sweet. And even if that were true... it doesn't matter, because nobody cares and no one sees our shit, and we're all talented but no one sees it so, it doesn't matter. This doesn't sound like you. I AM TIRED OF BEING OPTIMISTIC! Okay? And I don't want to be the fucking girl who cries. But... Maybe I have felt like a failure all this time. And I felt like it was my duty to keep you guys happy and living the dream. But no one sees our shit and we work so fucking hard. And we spend so much fucking money. And no one sees it and no one cares. Lena. I'm here because I believe in you, alright? I believe in us. Always have, I mean, we do really great work together. Right? Yeah, yeah. I'm proud of the work we do. We all should be proud. Really? I thought you hated it up here. It's not that bad. Not that bad. Come on, it frickin' rules up here, man. I'm digging the whole spooky town history stuff. Really? Yes. So you guys don't want to leave? I'm not going anywhere. Yeah, we're in it 'til the end. I'm sorry, you guys. I'm an asshole, I'm sorry. - No, no. - You know what? Let's get you to bed and we'll talk about it more in the morning. - Okay. - You ready? - Yeah. - Help me out, Kevin You got it, alright, alright. - You good? - Fuck, I'm gonna puke. Okay, okay, it's okay It's okay And the secret to a good quiche is, and they don't tell you this in most recipes, is you don't want to beat the eggs. You getting this, Kev-Mo? What's the difference? Good question. The difference is you don't want any air in the custard. You want to gently stir the eggs into a smooth, even consistency. What's going on? What will emerge from... Oh my God. It's so bright in here. - Oh my God. - Good morning. It's a horrible monster. Looking beautiful as ever. Ya know, I actually feel pretty good today. Yeah, me too. Ya know, I wanted more wine last night but... Oh, I wanted more wine last night. Fuck you guys. Hello? Lena: Oh my God, go away. Hey Lena, could you get the door? Are you serious right now? Oh my God, why are you filming this? This is what I do. This is bad, okay. Hello? - Hey, it's Chantal. - Chantal. Hey. How did you like my uncle's house? Hey. Actually, we didn't find it. I can take you there. My Uncle Gagnon is very kind. Did you just say Gagnon? Oh, I did not tell you? Yeah, Gagnon. Aurore would have been my great-aunt. Oh, you're related. Yeah. Do you think he would show us the house? Oui, I can ask. Awesome. Hey Chantal, you like quiche? Oui. Come on, come on. You hear that, Aaron? - You have a fan. - Cool, two more hours. Okay. What's up with people today? What do you mean? I'm getting beer. Pay for it, Kevin. We're watching you, dude. So what's Chantal's story? What do you mean? I don't know, she seemed pretty cool. And you know Kevin's kinda lonely, so. Kev Mo needs to get... I'm starting to get the feeling nobody wants us here. This book is really interesting. See, I did a good thing. I just got to this part where it talks about spiritual possession. Like exorcism shit? This is fucked up. It says, "In the early 1600s, villagers used to take part in a sacrificial blood transferring ritual in order to keep people's spirits away." I mean, you gotta see this. Okay. Oh shit, like a human sacrifice. That's what it looks like. Human sacrifice? It's like having a literal blood bath. Sounds awesome. Yeah, that's not weird. Aren't you guys gonna eat the sandwiches I made you? Oh, you made sandwiches? Oh yeah, I'm starving. Ooh! And where exactly are we going? To see a haunted streetlight. - Hmm. - Uh-huh. This one looks pretty scary. So it's not far, just to the right. Okay. - Huh - KEVIN: It's cold. What? Guys, guys. Another late night gathering. Aaron: Shit! Are they still looking? - Yes. - I don't know. Shit. Just the way they were looking at us though... Yeah, but you have the camera in their face, dude. I'm just saying, it's weird. I'm not, it's not a problem - we need to solve. - Yeah, it was weird. Okay so apparently, Yeah. every night at approximately 1:15 a.m., Uh huh. this light flickers. You know there's any number of reasons why a light would flicker? You know there's any number of reasons? Aaron, could be really great motivation, okay? So chill out. Alright, yeah, totally. Yep, you're right, it's haunted. Do you guys know what time it is? 12:58. Okay. That gives us about 17 minutes. Sorry it's cold. Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. - Spooky streetlights. - The light is flickering. Yes, I'm sure you see a lot of things. Hand it over, man. Alright, it's almost showtime. If this does happen, I'm gonna get freaked. This is so stupid, guys. Seven seconds. You see, nothing. Can we just wait one more second, come on. Alright. Alright, no ghost, let's get outta here. Okay I'm cold, I'm tired. Wrong way, Lena. What are you doing? Yeah What the fuck? What is this? Could be cars coming, Lena. - Come on! - You guys. You know you're injured, right? Yeah I mean... how many chances do you get in a lifetime to sit in the middle of the fucking road and watch the stars with a "jay"? You're just gonna get cold and wet. I don't know that this is... Yeah, and I'm gunna have fun while doing it. Shit, yep, this is happening. Sounds cool. Come on, Aaron. No way I'm lying in the middle of a road with this camera. Uh-huh, wah. You're not gonna get hurt, it's fine. Yeah, I'll just film you idiots from here. Or maybe 10 feet back. See the stars, dude? - Yes. - So peaceful up here. You can see the stars with that streetlight above you? Aaron, shut up. Is Kevin asleep? Yep. Kev! Hey, buddy? How can you sleep, man? Are you really asleep, dude? Kevin, wake your ass up! He's so cute. Kev, I'm pretty cold though. Oh shit, alright, guys. Car coming. Kev. Kevin, wake up, come on. Kev. - Kev, you're messing, right? - Seriously, come on. You're messing. - Kevin. - Fuck, Aaron. Fuck, shit, shit, shit, - shit, shit, shit. - Kev. Dude! Shit, shit shit shit Okay, okay, okay. Careful, slippery. Okay, okay. - Kev, Kev, come on. - Kevin, come on, come on. - Shit, Kevin, come on. - Dude, If you're fucking messing, oh my God. - Alright, just pull him up. - Oh shit, shit, okay. - I got him, I got him. - No, I can, Jesus Christ, it's coming, Aaron! Fuck, oh fuck. Aaron, hurry, come on. Fuck, that was sick. - Yeah. - What happened? What the fuck - was that, Kevin? - Oh my God! I think I passed out. Aaron, you okay, dude? Jesus, Lena, are you trying to get us killed? That weed is strong. By the way, how is this my fault, Aaron? Wow, it's beautiful here. Sure is. - Cool house. - Well guys, this is the house where Aurore died. I could die at a place like this. You almost - did last night. - Hey guys! Hey, Chantal! He'll be here in a minute. - Okay. - Come in, come in. - It's so cold outside. - Thank you. Kevin, did you see the ass of your coat? Is that from dragging you across the road? Yep, watch your step. - Thank you, thanks. - Hey Kevin! Chantal, ah, you remember me. Yeah, I do. Hey Aaron, with the camera. Okay. Nice to meet you. Is he cool with the camera? It's okay, no problem. Thank you so much. - Thank you. - Don't stay there. - Come in, come in. - Okay, wow, thanks. This place is amazing. Please, have a seat. Well, thank you so much for having us at your home. We appreciate it. Okay. Can we maybe just start with his relation to Aurore? Telesphore was his great-uncle. Did he know him? He knew him when he was alive, but he was very young. Okay. Um... What was he like, do you remember? Yeah, too young to remember. Okay. Um... Can you ask him what it's like to be a Gagnon? Um... Do you know what he's... It's a curse! The Gagnon name. Curse. The house is haunted. For real? Chantal! Sometimes the crucifix falls off the wall. Really? Shit. Okay. He doesn't want you to think he's crazy. Oh, no, no. Would he mind showing us the crucifix? It was Telesphore's room. That's crazy. It's the crucifix that falls off the wall. There's a lot of bugs and flies... Kevin. Okay, it's not that the crucifix bother him, it's the scratching sound in the other room. Scratching sounds? Yeah. Mort? He said it's Aurore's room where she died and now it's always locked. At night he hears... During the night he hears scratchings sounds. Has he checked for rodents or raccoons or? Okay. He asked for an exterminator. Didn't work and he make come a priest. - A priest? - Yeah, to bless the room. And this is a few years ago now and since then, it's closed. Blessings didn't work, huh? No. Let's go in. - No problem. - We can pay. How much? It's okay, thank you for showing us. Okay, let's have some tea. - Alright, Alright. - Thank you, wow. I'm sorry! I'll fix it, I will fix it, I will fix it! Oh my God! What the fuck were you thinking, dude? I was trying to get a glimpse inside that room. So you ripped the rosary off the doorknob? I don't get what your issue is, man. If there's ghosts here, I want to see them. I wasn't trying to break the thing. I was trying to take it. Oh, that makes it so much better. Dude, you need help. Seriously, I think you might be a klepto. Yeah, and you managed to make enemies with the one family we need help from for our fucking film. Stop the car! Jesus! Oh fuck. I saw somebody. Alright, I think it's about here. "Seriously, I think you might be a klepto." "I'm not a klepto" Yeah, and you managed to make enemies with the one family we need help from for our fucking film." Stop the car! Did you see it? - No, I saw nothing. - Alright, go back. Go back, back, back, yes. - Oh my God. - Okay. - Okay, I see it too. - That's her. You guys, that's the girl I saw before. Alright. Jesus. Well first of all, I see it too. But it could be a stump. - A stump? - Yeah. You're a fucking stump. Aaron, there's a face there. Or a smudge on the window. There's a face. Let's go to after we break. Hang on. - Gone, okay. - Yeah, that's after. - She was there. - Go back to when - she was there. - I'm doing that, see? So it could be a smudge on the window interacting with the environment. Okay, sure. Give a fucking break, man. That's a girl. No, it's a foreground... Are you serious, Aaron? - Foreground, background. - You're just denying what's on the screen right now. I'm not denying it, I hear you, I just think we tend to see what we want to see or think - what we want to think. - Fuck that supposed to mean? You think I want to see a girl in the road? Yeah, I don't want to see this shit, Aaron. What the fuck is that? Alright, have fun, play with it. Play with it? - I'm gonna go lay down. - Aaron! No, I'm tired of talking about it. - You saw this. - I'm tired in general. - Walking away. - You're tired. - Yep. - Take a nappie. - Yep, this timezone's a dick. - Alright. Amazing. - Long day. - Seriously? Hard day. There's not enough wine for whatever the fuck is going on right now. Oh Kevin, you didn't. Kevin, this is the biggest dick move you've ever made. - We're taking it back. - Fuck that. - Dude. - Kevin! We're taking it back right now, come on. I took this for a reason. And that is? Okay, I was reading the Languages of the Dead. Yeah, the other thing that you stole. Just listen, please. Fucking leg is killing me. There's a part in that book that talks about communicating with the dead. Yeah, I'm aware. It's called Languages of the Dead. Right. So then you also know that it talks about communicating with the dead through use of a icon thing. Yeah, like a talisman or some bullshit. You know it better than I do. We could try to talk to Aurore using that. I mean, think about it. We may not even have to write our script. We could maybe just film what's happening here around us. For real. And voila, as they say. And that's our film. Just gotta get Aaron on board. Yeah. Did we leave this shit on? - Cued up? - Yeah. Okay. Alright, here we go. Aaron! What? You gotta come down here, man. Why? Dinner. Alright. I have full body chills. Shh. Give me the thing. Don't let him see it. Hey. Hey. you guys haven't moved. What are you baking? Pepperoni pizza. Okay, Aaron, you need to see this. - Okay. - Check it out. Okay, so. We've been looking at all the footage that we shot since the day we got here. And? Okay, so just watch the grave. "Telesphore". Is that a face? - Yeah. - Yeah. Yeah, like... It's there. Then it's not there. Okay so then, remember the night we got high? Just watch the cross. Okay. Kevin: "Are you okay?" Jesus. That's a fucking rotation. - I mean... - Back to what it did. - Does it go back? - No, I mean, it turns like that and then it stays. Okay, sorry. Show the last one. Did I shoot all these? Yeah. Alright. What am I looking at? So, the mirror. "Fucking messed up". "Yeah". Oh, fuck! - I mean... - Dude. There's a face. There's a presence here and we captured it, man. Aaron, you captured it. What am I looking at? You guys are messing with me. Yeah, okay, we edited this in here. I... I don't know what to say to this. This is fucking crazy. This is our real footage, man. And it's gold. I think it's watching us, now. - Don't say that! - I'm sorry. You realize this is our film now, right? Wait, what? Okay, so Kevin and I have been talking. Shit. And Aaron, look, we have legit paranormal activity on camera. Okay? This is it, this is our film. All we have to do is shoot everything that happens from this point on. So just film and hope we catch something. Yeah. Why wouldn't we? We already have, dude. And maybe we go a little deeper. Go deeper? The only place I want to go right now is home. This is fucking crazy, this is fucked up! Aaron, I'm thinking that this spirit or presence or whatever it is could be Aurore. And we should try to communicate with her. Communicate with her, you fucking psychopath. Dude, we have a whole book about talking to spirits and dead people. Really, you're into this, Kevin? This is potentially huge for us. I think you're scared. Yeah, I'm fucking scared! That's the appropriate response! You know what? You're getting a little crazy right now. I'm crazy. We have all this footage that you just saw with your own eyes, okay? Whatever, whoever is here, you saw it, okay? And we should try to communicate with it. I don't understand you guys, this is, where are you going? This is fucking bull. Dude, come on. Really, Kev-Mo? You're on board with this? What do you mean, man? We've been waiting for something that's gonna sell. - Come on, you guys! - Jesus. Hey, can you hit the light? Yeah, let me just start by saying this is the worst fucking idea you guys have ever had. Can you not be a dick, please? I'm here, aren't I? Let's just do this. Yeah. Oh, I'm fine here. - Someone has to shoot this. - Okay, fine. Here we go. Do you have the rosary? How did, - is that from Aurore's house? - Can you not worry about this right now, please? You've got to be fucking kidding me. Okay. You ready? We're here in peace. Is there a presence here with us in this house? Did you just, guys did you... What the fuck? Hello? Is there someone in this room? We. Are. Friends. Aurore? Try French. Oh, okay. Do you smell that? Yeah, it smells like smoke. Sulfur? I just smell the candles. Oh fuck, the pizza. Alright, I'm done with this shit. Kev, can you blow those out? Son of a bitch! Burnt to a crisp! Aaron. Really, Lena? Dude, you always do this. I don't want to fight with you, Lena. Why does every fucking thing have to be an argument? None of you brought the camera? You guys trying to burn the house down? Kev-Mo! Aww. You look so sad. I think I got one bite of actual food because we are ghost hunters now. So much smoke. If you guys are still hungry, I can make scrambled eggs or something. - Yeah. - Yeah? Anything's better than this shit. I won't say no. Alright. Earthquake! I thought you said they don't get earthquakes here. We don't! Shit. Well, first time for everything, I guess. Holy fuck! Jesus fuck! Which one of you stole my book? That was me, I'm sorry. I took this too. I don't know what the hell's wrong with me. Is that from the Gagnon house? Yeah. Put it away! Is there something you're not telling us? You should not have taken it. Dude, what's going on with you? I don't know, my back feels like it's burning. Is there something there? Holy fuck, what did you do? - I didn't do anything. - Let me look. What is it? You have communicated with a spirit, but it is not Aurore. - Whatever is here is too big. - Fuck! Lena: Kev, Kev, Kev? - Oh my God, Kevin! - Calm down, calm down - Something's happening! - Oh my God, okay. - What's going on? Kevin? - It's okay, it's okay. - What's happening? - Kevin. It's okay. Lena: Oh my God! What's happening to him? - Keep filming it. - Okay, okay, I'm filming. Film it! Film it! M-A-H... - Oh fuck! - Marie-Anne Houde? He has been marked. - What? - Oh Jesus, fuck. We gotta get him to a hospital! It's okay. It's okay, breathe. - It's too late. - Too late? They will be coming for him. What! Who's coming for me! What are you fucking talking about! Only they can put an end to this. - I'm so sorry. - Wait, wait, no! Wait! Where you going? Wait! - It's okay, it's okay. - Oh fuck. It's okay, it's okay. Fuck. Fuck. What the fuck? What is this? What is this? May God have mercy on you. Have mercy on... what? Is this some kinda joke? Where are you going! Oh my God, oh my God, Kev, it's okay. What do you want! Lena! It's okay, Kevin. What the fuck? What are they saying? I don't know, I don't know these words. Aaron, get in the house! Get in the house! Kevin, where's Kevin? - Kevin? - Kevin! Lena: Fuck! Oh my God, Kevin, Kevin! Kevin! Kevin, Kevin, Kevin! - Come on, Kevin! - Fuck! Aaron, is he up there! Aaron! Did you find him! No! Check the basement. Shit, shit, come on. Turn off the light. Kevin! - Kevin! - Kev-Mo, come on! It's not fucking funny! Kevin! Kevin! - Aaron, Aaron... - Still out there? Aaron, Aaron, Aaron, Aaron, Aaron, Aaron! I don't know what the fuck is going on! It's okay. - What the fuck? - Aaron. Wait, wait, wait. Get your coat, we have to go out the back, come on. Jesus, what are they doing to him? Oh my God! Kevin! Oh my God, I think my battery's running out. My leg hurts so much. Fuck, why can't we hear him anymore? I'm losing my shit, Aaron. I know, I know, come on. We can find him, we're gonna be okay. I heard him, I heard him. - Kevin, Kevin! - Okay. Okay There's a farm over there. - Kevin! - Kevin! Aaron, I hear the chanting. What are we gonna do? Oh my God, Aaron. Kevin! - Fuck. - Shit, shit. Kevin! Kevin, we're coming. Aaron. It stopped. We have to go to the police. - Lena? - Oh fuck! - Jesus Christ. - Oh my God, Chantal, Chantal. We need someone to call the police. Kevin is missing, we can't find him. - We need help. - It's okay, it's okay. You don't need to be scared anymore. - What? - Okay. Your friend is here. What do you fucking mean? Where! Where is he? He's inside, don't worry about it. What? - Kevin. - Okay? - Kevin, Kevin. - Jesus Christ. What did they do? - Why did they take him? - Chantal! Can you tell us? - Chantal? - Fuck. Aaron, Aaron, I don't like this. It's okay, alright? Aaron, what's happening? - Lena, Lena. - Aaron, Aaron. Whatever happens. Jesus Christ, they're chanting again. Chantal, what is this? Why won't you talk to us? Tell us what's happening? What do you fucking mean? Tell us what's going on. Chantal! - It's time now. - Time for what? Aaron, Aaron, hold my hand. Oh my god. Oh, holy fuck! - Kevin! - Lena! Lena! Lena, Lena, we have to get out of here! Aaron, they got Kevin! We have to get outta here! I'm so sorry! No! No! It's okay! - I should have never... - No. No. It's okay Lena! No! Lena! WHAT DO YOU WANT!! This is exactly the reason that I stopped doing dark web mystery boxes here on the channel. This is murder evidence. I'm gonna have to turn this into the authorities. I really don't have any choice at this point. You saw what I saw.
