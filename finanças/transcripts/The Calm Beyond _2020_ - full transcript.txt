How did it come to this? It's been five years already. The storm has passed, but I'm stuck in its wake. Everything's gone... and I'm still here. If you hear this, there is hope. We have food, shelter and supplies. Our location is 22.27... That's one. That's two. That's... three. All right. I need that. All right, now... Okay, that's 12. That's 8. Looks so dry. When is it going to rain again? All right, so 12 and 8. Fish today or chicken? Oh, no, no, no. What is that? Okay. Waste of time. There's no one here. Maybe you're just not looking hard enough. I know what I saw. I thought I saw something. Well, cheers. And you can tell me how it is. Is it good? - It's really good. - This is, technically, our first meal as sisters. Does this count as a meal? Mm, this can be the appetizer. What does it taste like? - Goodness. - Goodness? Should we take a picture? Give me something. Give me something. What's in there? What's over there? Caught you! Ow! Ooh, I like this. Tsk, I thought we were shopping for your sister's birthday? Half-sister. And I am. Doesn't mean I can't find a couple nice things for me. - A couple? - What? Didn't I say we were gonna celebrate? Celebration time. Oh, here we go. She'll like this. Hey, that's cute. It looks just like your jacket... but cheaper. It's okay. That way, she'll stop borrowing mine. - Yeah. - I'm gonna get this. Hey, do you think I need more denim in my life? - Basic L.A. energy. - Heh, yeah. Oh, you're coming to Tristan's party, right? Yes, you've only asked me like 87 times. I know it's a big deal. I'll be there. Okay, good. I'm just making sure. - Do you think that...? - No. He doesn't suspect anything. - And...? - And, yes, he'll be surprised. Okay, good. Oh, oh, oh! I am staying at yours that night. Oh, my God. Are you kidding me? You're still hiding that you have a boyfriend? You're 24. Ugh! Come on, you know how traditional my parents are. They would have a stroke if they knew I was dating a non-Chinese guy. You know what? You need to just grow a pair. When I told my parents I was gonna move out, they just accepted it. I think about that a lot. Moving in with Tristan, having my own space... - Yeah. - ...but I can't. You know what? You're an adult now. They're just gonna have to deal. Plus, it's not like you can't afford it. Miss Associate Merchandise Buyer! Okay, maybe you're right. - I'll think about it. - Yeah. Oh! It's like she can hear us. - It's okay, let's go. It's fine. - Leave me alone! I think I saw durian back there. What? Hi. Hey! Hey. Here. Wow, thank you. Thank you, jiejie. It's just like yours. - Oh... - Now that you have your own, you won't have to borrow mine all the time. Thanks. Huh? Wait, what? Poh Poh's necklace? Yeah, but that's not the point. It should go to the oldest daughter. I'm the oldest. You okay? Fine. - I'm Asha. - Hmm? My name is Asha. Okay. You're scared. It's okay. It's okay to cry. I don't cry. You don't? Wow. I cry a lot. Yeah? Yeah. Before, I cried every night. With so much snot. You miss family? Yeah. Ah Ma. But I'll see her soon. You will? Yeah. When I leave. - Oh. - I'm gonna build a boat, and we're going to find her... and go far away from here. Okay. My name's Yuen Hei. But people call me Hei Hei. Night, Hei Hei. Wait! No! No! No, no! No, no, no, no! No! Oh! No! That tape, it was... Oh. Okay. Excuse me. Don't play with everything. Okay. Since you're gonna be here, we're gonna have rules, okay? First, don't touch my stuff. Second, don't slam any doors or make any loud noises. Sound travels, people are always listening. They are not as nice as me. - Pretty. - Hey, are you listening? That was pretty cool. What? Hei Hei. That little thief. I'm gonna... I found food! Get it out of here! What do you do if the bad men come? - What? - The bad men. What do you do if they come? I have a hiding place. Can I hide there too? Weren't you leaving? You can come. No. I won't. Why not? This is my home. And plus, there's no point. There's nothing out there anyway. Nothing? No. Not really. Anyway, let's deal with these tangles. Here. You have a couple of tricks up your sleeve, huh? Ah Ma, she taught me. - Did you take my necklace? - Huh? My necklace, you know, the one I always wear. Did you take it? It's okay if you did. - No. - Just be honest. - I won't be mad. - No! You really didn't? Hei Hei? I'm not upset if you took the necklace. I'm just not good at this whole being with people thing. I'm just used to being alone. It's just... easier. I mean, it's been so long. The last person I talked to was... It's just been a long time... and I don't like people touching my stuff, you know? It's not like I'm mad. Seriously? The silent treatment? What do you want me to say? I'm sorry that I accused you. It's fine if you took it. You can tell me. I'm not upset. Okay, fine. I'm upset. Are you happy now? Don't touch my stuff. What just happened? Huh? What the...? Where's the...? What the...? Is this okay? Is this okay, jiejie? I don't know. Ask Ma. I'm not allowed to help with dumplings, right? Yeah, the worst typhoon in history. - Jiejie. - Yeah, I know. None of those places were built like Hong Kong, but still. Ma, I'm on the phone. Phone later. I'll call you back. The master beckons. I don't see what the big deal is. You already have yourself a slave. Don't talk like that. Why can't you be a good girl like your sister? Asha? Asha? Asha? Asha! Wake up. Wake up. It's okay. It's Hei Hei. It's okay. The lights work. Only this one, but it's always flickered like that. Plus, I don't trust electricity around so much water. Come on. So we change the headlamps in the stairwell much less because we don't use them as much, right? Hey, are you listening? What's in that room? Which room? At the end of the corridor with no handle. Oh, yeah. That room. It... stinks. Oh. And when we let that smell out, it's everywhere. Like warm farts. I don't care what social media says. - Massive waves... - This is different. ...have devastated Indonesia and the Philippines... ...Singapore has been completely destroyed by floods. Ah Ma! That was important! - Family's more important. - Call you later. But there are actual disasters that we should actually be worried about. Eat first. Worry after. You're working? I thought you had that party... Ow! - You will go. - It's okay. Your father too nice. We go as family. You're part of our family, so you will go. Maybe I don't wanna be a part of this family. - Jiejie. - Okay. Then you go find another family. - Fine! I will. - Go! This place is like a prison anyway. Jiejie. Jiejie. - Jiejie! Don't go! - Okay, go! Maybe I'll move in with my boyfriend. Don't go! - It's okay. You'll be fine. - MOTHER: So anyone out there, if you hear this, there is hope. We have food, shelter and supplies. Our location is 22.2759 degrees north by 11... Asha! Asha! Asha! I found help! Asha! I found help! Be quiet! - We just need a boat. - No, we don't. Why not? They said they'll help us. No. We don't know that, okay? We don't know how long it's gonna take to get there and how easy they are to find. Once we go back, we can't come back, so no. - We're staying here. - But if we try... Just stop it! Just... stop it, okay? Just forget it. - You're a coward. - Well, you're a thief. I didn't mean... I didn't take your dumb necklace. You think you're so nice to me, but you're not. You're just an angry, bitter, scared person with no life. You can look if you want, but don't touch. You're building a raft. Hey, now I have to fix that. You know this won't work. Well, I'd ask you to help me, but I can't trust you. You might steal from me. Hei Hei, you know you can't go out there. It's dangerous out there. You'll never survive. There are things in the water, the weather's unstable, you could get lost, starve or... worse. How do you know? You don't even try. Anyways, I have protection. What the...? Where did you get this? I found that. It's mine. This is not a toy, okay? If this flare gun goes off, they will hear us, find us, and then it's game over. Do you understand? I'm sorry, but you don't know what's out there. I do. I tried to find help... before. It was bad, Hei Hei. Very bad. But it's not safe here too. Why do you say that? They'll find us. - Who will? - The bad men. You talk about them all the time. Even in your sleep. Well, now I have you here to keep us hidden and safe, right? Yeah. Okay. Clean all this up and put it back where you found it, okay? Okay. Can I have the gun? Nice try. - Jiejie! - What are you doing? Go back in. Please, jiejie! Please don't go. I can't go back. I can't go back to that prison. I mean, I have no space, no freedom. Everyone's in my stuff. Even you! Come on. That's my jacket. Look... I'll come home tomorrow and talk to Pa and Ma... but I am moving out. It's just time. But we can still hang out. We can go get fries. Can we go now? No. Nice try. Wanna help me get a taxi? Hey, you're not wearing the necklace. - Hei Hei, wake up. - Hm? I need your help. So much water. We've got a lot of work to do. Hmm? Um, Asha? What is it? I'm not sure if you believe me. I'm not sure how to say this. - What is it? - Well, first, I'm sorry how I talk about your necklace. - About wishing... - It's okay. We were both... stupid. Anyway, I'm kind of glad it's gone. Really? Yeah. I'm glad. Wow. - Looks good. - Thanks. Hei Hei. - Thanks. - Welcome. Shall I cook some noodles to celebrate the rain? Yeah. I'll open a can of meat and pickled cabbage too. - Let's go nuts. - Okay. Is that your sister? It's the only one I have of us together. She's pretty. Yeah. She was. You don't talk about her too much. What's there to talk about? She's gone. They're all gone. Yeah. Dead. But, hey, we're not gone. We're still here, right? Yeah. - And we have each other. - Mm-hm. And Grace. - Grace? - Mm-hm. Grace. Right. And Grace. Let's eat the food. It's getting cold. - Wow. Three sausages each? - Yep. What happened to rationing? I know. Well, yeah, it's a celebration. There you are. Well, the water's clean and stored and done the laundry, and... Hey. Look at that. What? The sky? It's a good one, huh? Yeah, I guess. Hey. Thank you for doing all that. Now I have something to show you. - Yeah? - Yeah. Come on. We can eat later. A raft! So you're definitely coming back tomorrow, right? Yeah. I promise. - Morning? - Wai... Yeah. Okay. Oh, God, I'm never gonna get a taxi here. Let's try over there. Come on. - I knew you'd take the jacket. - What? I knew you'd take the jacket. I put something in the pocket. Ow! Asshole! Oh, my God! Amy, run! Run! Hei Hei. - I didn't... - I know. The catch was broken. I'm really sorry. Here. There. - Keep it safe for me? - Okay. Thanks. - Hei Hei. - Hm? I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Please, no one hear that. Please, no one hear that. Please! Please! Please! No, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I know, but, Hei Hei, it's just not safe. Please, we can still do it. Hei Hei, we'll go, but not right now, okay? We have to wait it out. Now come on, help me do this. Come on. Go over there. That's good. Come on. Let's go. Nothing. Hei Hei? Hei Hei? All clear. Nice hiding spot. You hungry? Are you sure? Might be the last hot meal you get for a while. There's no room to light a stove on the raft. We're going? There she is! I see her. Asha! Asha! Asha! Asha! Asha! Asha! Hey, get the bed! Hurry! Get Grace. Come on. Hurry. Come on. Come on. Yeah. Okay. - No. No. Wait, you can fit. - It's okay. No. You have to stay here, okay? - No. No. - It's okay. - No. No. - No. It's okay. - You have to stay here. - You can fit. No, no. It's okay. No, it's okay. We are running out of time. Stay here. It's okay. - I wanna go with you. - No, it's okay. - I'll find another spot. - Don't leave me. Hei Hei, I'm not going to leave you, okay? Before you, I had nothing. I had nothing, okay? I didn't have anything to live for, nothing to care about. You changed that. Okay? You changed that. We're gonna find a new life together, okay? I promise. When it's time, I'm gonna come for you, okay? I'll come for you, I promise. Okay? - But where are you hiding? - I know the perfect place. Somewhere that smells like warm farts, okay? - Okay? Okay? - Promise? Okay? Be quiet, okay? Okay? - Okay, go! - I will! - Jiejie! - Go! Oh, my God, Amy! Go, go, go! Amy, come here! Go! Go that way! Go that way! Come on, Amy! - Stay close to me! - Wait! - Hurry! Amy, come on! - Slow down! You're hurting me! Come on! Wait! - Slow down! - Hurry up! Ow! You're hurting me! - Hey! - Come on, Amy! Hurry up! Come on! - My ankle! - Come on! - Come on! Let's go! - Wait! - Wait for me. - Stay with me! Wait! Wait! Amy, come on! Wait! Wait! Asha! Come on, Amy! She's in there. Get up! Get up! Hei Hei! Oh! What are we gonna do with you? You can move if you like. I like it when they wriggle a little. No! No! Shit. It's all right. We've got plenty of time for that later. Stupid bitch! It's okay. I'm not gonna hurt you. Whoa! If you hear this, there is hope. We have food, shelter and supplies. Our location is 22.2759 degrees north, by 114.1455 degrees east. - There is hope. - All right, where are you? No! No! No! No! Please don't leave me. Please! Please! No! No! Shit! Okay. Why'd you save me? Because I get it. It's hard to make good choices with only bad options. Want some? If you hear this, there is hope. We have food, shelter and supplies. Our location is 22.2759 degrees north by 114.1455 degrees east. There is hope.
