BELINDA AND ME - Good morning! - Hello. Jacqueline! You've been a great help. Thank you, Cécile. What will you do with it? Give it to an organization she was fond of. I'll keep this. It was her favourite book. How about a cup of tea? It'll do us good. Why did she stop the concerts? Because of her rheumatism. A tearoom in the wine capital. What a challenge! You're right, but it wasn't her first idea. Her first idea was to open an antique shop. Talk about a distraction! I said to her, "Marie-Louise, "you'll get bored surrounded by old furniture. "Whereas a tearoom with a piano, "where you can play... "And it'll draw people." They also came for her meringues. Marie-Louise's meringues were certainly popular. What a laugh we had! You can't imagine. She was like a sister to me. It was the same for her. - Didn't she have family? - Yes. A bourgeois bunch who regarded her as a clown. Look at the photo over there. Her great-nephew. She called him "Little Jean". She was so fond of him. She gave him piano lessons. She said he was very gifted. Then one day, she fell out with her family. She never saw him again. She left the piano to him. You know, Cécile... I really miss her. So much... So very much. Sorry, excuse me. Would you like some? I couldn't have coped without you. - Thanks again. - See you soon. - Hello, Mrs Escandier. - Sorry. You gave me a fright. Hello, Mr Loisel. I wanted to let you know someone is interested in the shop. He wants to open a pizzeria and start the work as soon as possible. Your lease expires in September... It isn't a problem, Mr Loisel. - You can have the shop. - Thanks. For the flat, I'll give you a bit of time. The flat? Hang on, you want the flat back too? Er, yes! It's part of the same lease. But I can wait a month or two. Goodbye. "Dear madam, "I was very sad to hear "Marie-Louise had passed away "as she was a dear person. "For the piano, "it would be simpler if I made the trip. "Jean." Little Jean. I hadn't planned to move. - It's going to be such a drag. - You sound pleased. Almost. There's nothing like problems to distract you from grief. I've an estate agent friend. I can't work miracles, but we'll manage. Want a lift? I'm picking my car up at the garage. - What's wrong with it? - Just a service. Why not buy a new car? I love my old DS. It's comfortable and spacious. I could even sleep in it if you don't find me a flat. Bye! I'm counting in you. "I arrive Wednesday at the 5:23pm train. "How will I recognise you?" Right. "I have short hair, "platinum blond, "I will be wearing "a blue jacket." So I recognize you, why not wear a flower? "A flower in my buttonhole"? "No carnations." An hibiscus flower then? An hibiscus flower? Where am I going to find that? "OK." Jean? Jacqueline? It's me you're waiting for. Jean? I prefer Belinda. Right. My car is in the car park. Here it is. It was made specially for her by Yamaha, at the height of her fame. It's a prototype. It's a shame I no longer play. I'll sell it. It's worth 10,000. It's yours. So this is the famous Piano Thé? - It was. - How long has it been closed? Three months. What rotten luck. There was no restaurant car on the train. I haven't eaten. All I have is pasta. My favourite dish. You're just being polite. It's true though. You're just how I imagined. Because you imagined me? Help yourself. Marie-Louise told me so much about you. That's impossible. When the two of us met, you hadn't spoken for over two years. We wrote to each other. At first. Then we forgot about one another. She didn't. She thought you could become a maestro... A great virtuoso. You've put your finger on the problem. Transgenders go with rock. But in a classical recital, it doesn't work. The world is changing. - You're an optimist. - Yes, that's true. And it's no business of mine. - She would've been disappointed. - So what? I've disappointed lots of people. In fact, Marie-Louise is just like everyone else. Why wear such thick foundation? It's old-fashioned. You look like a hooker. - You don't mince your words! - True. I don't like the way you talk about her. Like she's a pain in the arse who made you do your scales. She reassured me. She enriched me. But I'm done with that scene. What does that mean? For 3 years, my priority has been not to drown. I see. - Did she mention the family? - Yes. She said, "They are a dying breed, "backward bourgeois folk, "with no artistic sensibility." I can confirm that. When she wanted to teach me to play Chopin, I can still hear my dad, "He's enough of a pansy already!" Is that what discouraged you? You know, when you have to look in the mirror every day to become the woman you are within, it doesn't leave you much time for anything else. - Coffee? - It'll stop me sleeping. Speaking of which, we need to find you a room. I can't find anything in here. Don't bother, I can't afford one anyway. Times are hard. Like a waiting-room bench. The first train is at 6am. I don't mean to pry, but... do you often travel without any money? - I've have a few euros. - How will you get home? Don't worry about me, I've got a return. I'm sorry you've got yourself into this position. We could've sorted it out on the phone. Let's say I wanted a change, to meet you. Marie-Louise's room is a mess. Sleep on the couch. - I'll get the sheets. - Thank you. It's Marie-Louise you should thank, not me. She wouldn't want you sleeping outside. LIBOURNE STATION I'll drop you here. When I find a buyer for the piano, I'll write. OK. Thanks for everything. Goodbye. - Write to this department. - Reimburse me. - Write to them. - You can't? - And this? - All the trains are late. By how much? We'll display the new times soon. OK. Never mind. Thanks. Following an attack on a railway employee, the service has been suspended until further notice. Jacqueline! - What are you doing here? - You'll never guess. The strike could go on indefinitely. I thought it was silly to wait at the station. Right. Leave it. I can clear the table. There! Done. Do you play cards? No. Really? How about Monopoly? No. Why? We could have played. What do you do in the evenings? I do bit of sewing or watch a film. Let's have a movie night! How about Sissi? - OK. - Come on, then. What's the matter? I had a nightmare. Sorry I woke you up. Wait. Take this. You'll sleep like a log. - Thanks. - Keep the glass. Will you be OK? Can I leave you? - Are you sure? - Yes. Oh no! Please. Could you leave the light on? Thanks. Goodnight. Come in. Come in! What's all this? I could only find crackers. But I can always go for croissants if you like. No, thanks. You shouldn't have. I love breakfast in bed. Don't you? And I love my habits. But seeing as you went to so much trouble... Any news of the train strike? I haven't checked yet. You should. OK. Could you close the curtains? No one is interested in pianos these days. If you'd said a harp or spinet, they're decorative... But this piano was made entirely by hand, by Yamaha. Like the motorbikes? It isn't an antique. It's a prototype. Look, I'll ask around. Leave me the photo and I'll put it online. I'm counting on you. Come on, let's go! Well, we'll see. Why don't we go to the park? No. I'm going home. OK. See you later. The two of us have to talk. - Yes? - Tell me if I'm mistaken. But are you trying to move in? If you are, it won't work. I feel happy in your home. - I don't want to leave. - You have to. I was delighted to meet you. A bit disconcerted, but delighted. Now our business is settled, and if the trains are running, you should go home. Where's home? I've no idea and it's none of my business. I was mistaken, then. - Marie-Louise's fault. - What's she got to do with it? This is the last letter she sent me. "You'll see, life is like music. "There's adagio and allegro. "It doesn't take much. "An encounter, sometimes." The rest is about you. "I've made a new friend. Her name is Jacqueline. "For her, there's a solution for everything. "She doesn't believe in desperate situations. "She is the best thing that's happened to me in years." I can't go back there. Right. Well, stay then. But don't make any plans. The owner has given me two months to get out. Careful! Don't touch the dish. It's very hot. I'm impressed. Here! Taste it to see if there's enough salt. - It's perfect. - Good. Hey, will you teach me to cook? It'll help me find a hubby. Why? You want someone to marry you for your cooking? Not only for that. More and more transgenders are getting married. - Have you already been married? - Yes. - Once or several times? - Once in my dreams. In church and the town hall. And then, two or three times. - Always to men? - Of course! When did you start batting for the other side? Sorry? Marie-Louise and you, how did it happen? Hang on a minute! You've got it all wrong. Me and Marie-Louise got on extremely well. We laughed, loved to talk, to put the world to rights. We complemented each other. It was a great friendship. And that's all it was! Aren't you finishing it? No. I've lost my appetite. I'm not having much luck with you. Why do I disgust you? Don't deny it. You're as prejudiced as everyone else. I accept your choice. It would be a lie to say I understood it. Firstly, I didn't have a choice. And there's nothing to understand. I'm a woman. I've never had any doubt. People thought I was wrong and did everything to convince me. Put yourself in their shoes. Put yourself in mine. Alright. How did it come about, this change? This change... You know, sexual identity, and all related suffering, is private. But if you change it, it becomes everyone's business. I've suffered a lot. And I'm still hurting. No one can take away what I've done. What now? What do you mean? Well... You can't be at war for the rest of your life. Hurting, as you say. That isn't a life plan. I haven't really thought about my life plan. It would be a good idea, though. No? This is a studio flat. But it's 29m2. The owner has renovated it. And look at the kitchen. The extractor fan comes on automatically. - Where is this studio? - Merignac. Near the airport. It's far from the centre... But handy when you fly!! If I can't sleep, I can count planes. Be reasonable. I convinced the owner you were the ideal tenant. Well, I'm not! No. No. You know how much trouble I went to? You're incorrigible. I know. Cécile, you know me well, give me an honest answer. - Am I prejudiced? - You? Yes. Like the majority of folk. About how people should be or appear? Has Belinda accused you of being prejudiced? What a nerve! May I borrow your lipstick? Yes, of course. Want to go out on the town? No. I don't think so. Come on, don't be scared. At night all cats are grey! I'm having a movie night. - What are you watching? - Trapeze. Wow! Not bad. - Who is he? - Burt Lancaster. I know he is not bad. He's gorgeous! - Want me to stay? - No. You go out. I'm too old. OK. I'll leave you with Burt. Could you hand me my bag, please? Here. Right. Here. Take the car. - Are you sure? - Yes. - You drive, don't you? - Yes. Don't get your hopes up. The only place for fun is the casino. And it closes at midnight. - Then I won't be late. - Enjoy yourself. Have a good evening. Thanks. Hi. Not there! It's the Eastern girls' patch. Their pimps are nasty. - How about a blowjob? - Get lost! Who are you? She's new. She didn't know. Don't take me for a jerk. Get out of here, quick! Run! I'm telling you she's new! No one in these bushes! OK. I get it. You're in a hurry. I'd love to go for a spin. Don't you have your keys? Yes, but there's a problem. Sorry to wake you, Mrs Escandier. I saw a stranger. She didn't have the car papers. I wanted to check everything was OK. Everything's fine. I lent her my car and I forgot to give her the car papers. Sorry again. It isn't your fault, it's mine. I was distracted. Do you know her well? Yes. Why? I was patrolling near the park, I went over to your car and saw he had a client. - You must be mistaken. - Believe me, I made no mistake. Goodnight, Mrs Escandier. Is that cop a friend? What did he have to say? Gossip, nothing terribly exciting. CLOSED DUE TO PASSING I only have two hands! - What's all this? - Flowers. For you. - And that? - I did the shopping. I bought us some champagne. I thought you were broke. Last night I put 10 euros on the 7, my favourite number. And I won. Don't you like my bouquet? Aren't roses your thing? What I don't like, is being taken for a fool. Right. OK, I lied. How would you have taken the truth? Badly, for sure. How do you think I survive? By teaching music to rich kids? No job is too lowly! Look, last night, it wasn't planned. But it bothers me to live off you. By the way, this is for you. I'm sorry this is how it ended. In a quarter of an hour, I'll be gone. Why did you decide to keep me? Did you think of Marie-Louise? - No. Not this time. - What's the reason then? Waste depresses me. And you're wasting your life. Given my assets, I have mitigating circumstances. But why? Was your life as a boy really so unbearable? Because you were attracted to men, is that it? If that was all, it wouldn't have been enough. I didn't dress as a woman because I thought it was better. It's far more simple. I am woman trapped in a man's body. I understand. The first time that I... That I dared to wear a dress, I understood I had just allowed myself to exist. That means a lot. You can't imagine. I felt so relieved. Full of hope. Proud. And that was new. What were you hoping for? To finally be seen as an ordinary woman. And you'll achieve that by streetwalking? You think it's achievable? Yes. But with conviction. You've said nothing. What do you think of it? It's more than I wanted to pay. Utilities and hot water are included. Do you like it? It's great! OK then, kids, we'll take it! I'll go tell the owner. - We'll wait over here. - See you later. Ah, thanks! Thank you. I feel relieved, you know. I was starting to worry. - Do you really like it? - Of course. - It needs a lick of paint. - I can do that. A parasol on the balcony. With jasmine. I love it! Sorry, Cécile. The owner says the flat is already taken. Why didn't he tell us? Do you believe him? He changed his mind. It's not nice. A transgender looks bad. What a jerk! Isn't a little fantasy ever allowed? Yes, but it's best to be an owner. - In the bin! - Here. We'll keep it for a heatwave. Iron. In the bin. I don't know what this is. God, it's old! In the bin. A shoe box. Crumbs! Oh dear! - All over the floor. - Pick up the photos. - You were gorgeous. - Let's see. Your hubby wasn't bad either. Yes. He was handsome. But he was such a bore. Why did you marry him? People got married then as easily as they divorce today. He got transferred to Madagascar. To go with him, we had to get married. I loved Madagascar. It was so colourful. You travelled a lot? Yes! That was just the start. Then what happened? A circus came to town. - A circus? - Yes. A circus. I met the wrong man, or Mr Right. He was a trapeze artist. His name was Ricardo. He was the sort of man who makes you want to drop everything and follow him. - What did you do? - I dropped everything. He left the circus? No. You must be kidding! Don't tell me you became a tamer? The circus was his life. It became mine. Even for a hot guy, I wouldn't go in a lions' cage. Oh lions! If you're confident, they sense it. I never had an accident. Ah yes! Once. Oh! A young panther. To play. Here. The sum in full. - Count it. - It's OK. No. I insist. It's all I could get. - You know, pianos. - I know. "No one is interested in pianos these days." Where will we stash this? That's what banks are for. My book was confiscated. A cheque bounced. Can you put it on your account? - If you like. - Thank you, sir. Goodbye. What's the matter? It's as if part of my life were being thrown away. You've always told me to look on the bright side. Sometimes, it's hard to know where it is. I'm the cause of your problems. Don't be silly. The worst thing is, I may have the solution. Published 2 months ago. If I hadn't come across this, I'd never have known. Known what? "Mrs Richard Croizet, his wife, "Jérôme and Xavier Croizet, his sons, "and Liliane Lancelot Croizet, his daughter-in-law, "are deeply saddened to announce the death of... "Richard Croizet." - Who was he? - My father. When we met at the station, I was at his funeral. For five years, I hadn't been to Périgueux. No one recognised me. Not even your mother? - I didn't go up to her. - You should have. That was stupid. I don't exist anymore. I'm not even on the obituary. My dad is dead, I never existed. You should've spoken to your mother. She'd have been moved, and hugged you. I called her a short time after. She wasn't moved in the slightest. She told me icily to come to the notary's. I hung up. I couldn't face them. You'll have to face them one day. What are you afraid of? Of their welcome. 5 years' absence can change people. You might be surprised. Imagine I take the risk and they don't recognise me. Or pretend not to, to humiliate me. There may be a way to prevent that. - We said not short. - We said not too short! What are you doing? Thinning it at the back. Marie-Antoinette, she had her hair cut too. I bet she didn't make as much fuss as you. - Well, are you done? - Wait a second. Hurry up! Well? Come over her. Turn round. It doesn't suit you, it doesn't suit you at all. I don't recognise you. It isn't you. You're stiff, uptight, lifeless. Oh, thanks! You can't know how pleased that makes me. Thank God I didn't cut it too short. I can't do this. No! We didn't come all this way for you to chicken out. You have to do this. Delormel and Sons Solicitors Come in. Everyone is waiting. Don't come near me! Don't force me to push you away! Jacqueline Escandier, I am a friend of Belinda. She asked me to come with her. She was expecting this welcome. I didn't believe her. Now I understand what she meant. Mrs Delormel is ready for you. Madam, your presence at the reading of this will is rather unusual since you are not family. But if no one objects... We have no objections. I'm not family either. Through marriage, you are though. Ah yes! That's true. - Do you have any objections? - It's too late for that. Right. I'll open it. "I, Richard Croizet, declare this to be my last will "and testament. "My estate is to be divided into 3 equal parts: "To my spouse, my properties. "To my sons, Jérôme and Xavier, "my shares in the factory, making them majority stakeholders. "The law does not allow me to disinherit my third child, Jean, "whose behaviour has always been a source of immense grief. "But as the law guarantees him a minimum share, "I ask him to accept whatever payment his brothers "offer him. "It is the least he owes a family... This was a bad idea! Sir, put an end to this nonsense. - The situation is hard enough. - For sure! - Dear madam... - I am not your dear madam, sir! Look, we will not get anywhere by being unpleasant. And it is in everyone's interest to find a solution. I suggest we discuss it calmly back at the house. Sir, could we have a clerk to draw up an agreement? My son will oblige. What do you say? Is this where you grew up? Yes. My father bought it from a friend who had a knife at his throat. He called it an opportunity. He loved opportunities. It put him in a good mood for at least 2 weeks! Hello. Thank you for coming, sir. My sons are expecting you. Show him. This way. Your brothers are in the library. You do not intend to join us. Wait for me here. I'll be OK. It's because the legal heirs are legally entitled to the deceased's assets and shares, as stated in article 724 of the Civil Code. - And it refers to this paragraph? - Precisely. Explain our proposal to him. Jean is standing up to them! Did you teach him to defend himself? You should give me lessons. Haven't you been offered a drink? - My mother is so rude. - No. The discussion is far from over. How's it going for him? - Sorry? - For her, if you prefer. I haven't seen my brother for five years. It's surprising. With a family like yours, nothing surprises me. - A family like ours? - Yes. It's true, they were awful to him. A homosexual son, maybe, my parents could have handled. But a son who claims to be a girl. Jean did well to leave. I believe he was lucky to have met you. - I have been lucky too. - There. It's a beautiful story. I'm reassured to know you're by his side. Because although minor, his share is still significant. He mustn't exasperate my brother. Jérôme is a jerk. He could initiate a lawsuit just to delay things. We must avoid that. - What do you mean? - Reason with Jean. If he agrees to our offer, everything will go smoothly You want me to meddle in someone else's business? It is your business. In a sense, Jean is your future. Even if you're disinterested, you can't be indifferent to money. Would you be willing to make a small gesture? Even a big gesture. That's good. No. No. I cannot go any further. Ask Mr Delormel about the state of our affairs. Times are hard! Accept what your brother is kind enough to offer you. Kind enough? Sir, the will states I am entitled to a share? Have you no shame? Come in. We haven't reached an agreement. Good! They didn't succeed with me either. - I don't see what you mean. - You do too! Your big gesture... the answer is no! - They tried to buy me. - What a surprise! What's all this about? She'd make anything up to sully respectable people. Respectable? Because you think you are respectable? You're pathetic. You are devoured by greed. You're just like your banknotes. All shrivelled. What's bothering you? Are you still thinking of them? Yes. You know, their offer, at one point, I almost accepted it. My mother could tell. She thought if she humiliated me further, I would cave in. It used to work. Not anymore. You don't regret it though? No. I don't have to apologize for being who I am. You're right. Come on. Let's go. Go all the way, go all the way. What does that mean, go all the way? It means the operation, breast implants. That's madness! I can't let you do that. My mind's made up. Can you see yourself in 30 years'? And there's the risks. Can you see yourself ageing all redone, mutilated even? Right now, I see myself as someone sick. I accept all the disadvantages. There is one you haven't thought of. I know. But at least I will be complete. You haven't had children either. Think about it. Some people have a birthmark on their face or a harelip. I have a man's genitals. But I'm a woman. - First, we'll run some tests. - I'm positive. It's an indispensable step. Then a biological analysis to determine your karyotype and the hormone doses. Will all that take a long time? You'll have to be patient for a few weeks. I need precise information to determine the treatment. What does the treatment involve? First, a series of injections of estradiol and progesterone. Know how to do jabs? No. You ought to learn. But I have to warn you, it's a long destabilizing process, sometimes with unpleasant effects. You'll need support. I'll be there. Thanks. - Are you OK? - Yes. I feel like I'm being born. Come on! Show me. No. Not like that. Walk. - Is your toe touching? - A bit. You'll need size 42 then. - You have them in 42? - Yes, of course. These days, girls have big feet. Because of sports. You must be very athletic. Yes. Very athletic! Look at that! It's hardly wearable. Except for the Cannes Film Festival. I could do with a red carpet dress! Come on, then. Jacqueline, look at this. Too dark for you. You have a fair complexion. What do you think? - You'd dare wear that? - Why not? Give it to me instead! Cheeky! Your heels are too high. I already told you! Place your bets. It's beautiful. What's that? Good evening. 20, black, even and passe. - What's your favourite number? - 7. Straight up! - If I win, we're off to Brazil. - Why? It's my dream. There are beautiful beaches, the samba, and the best surgeons. 7, red, odds and manque. Brilliant! No. When you win, you have to stop. Come on! You're right. It ought to be enough. Brazil... We're already there! You're completely nuts! For you. Want a lift or are you staying? The car's by the park. Don't go without telling me. - Promise! - Why not come along? Oh yes! Well... How much did you win? 2,000 I think. 2,000? Hey, that's good! Not bad, yes. What happened to you? Ah, it's you? You know each other? I told you about her. - Was it the Eastern girls? - No. Some bastards. They nicked my bag. I put up a fight. - Report it to the police. - No. - Go to hospital. - No way. You need stitches. If she doesn't want to, there must be a good reason. We can't leave her here. Can you walk? Help her, Belinda. - Jacqueline Escandier? - Yes. Superintendent Vignaud. I would like to interview about a procuring case. - Sorry? - Please come with us. Is this some kind of joke? No, madam. But... You don't have the right! You don't have the right. - No. Leave them alone! - Let go of me! Leave them alone! Take them away! - Let go! - Calm down! - You can't... - Let go! Do you have... Let me speak! Do you have a warrant? Show me your search warrant! You admit you lodge Mr Croizet, who works as a prostitute? Yes. I mean, no. He lives with me, but does not prostitute himself. That isn't what this report says. And Vanessa Mercier, known as Jacinthe, aged 15. Also a known prostitute. 15 years old! She was hurt. She didn't want to go to hospital, so I took her in. Do you often take in strangers? Belinda knew her. They had already met. In what circumstances? Don't bother trying to think up another lie, madam. A lie? It's you who are lying. You're the liar! Please sit down. I shall make a note. Insulting behaviour towards a police officer, and violence. Mrs Escandier? Hello. Mrs Florence Bardini. Hello, madam. Right. Right, are you ready to meet the liberty and custody judge? It is he who will decide if you will be remanded. If I'll be remanded? Why? The superintendent has submitted a case and requested you be remanded in custody. Your revolt at the police station did not go down well. But we have a trump card. You have a clean record. And, if you don't mind my saying so, you're not a young woman. And Belinda? - What will happen to her? - She's been questioned. She refused to incriminate you. Don't worry. The most she'll get is a fine. But tell me... What's all this about a sum of cash deposited on your account? Ah, here it is! 3,000 euros. - 3,000 euros? - Yes. That's the money from the sale of the piano. Why? Is it a problem? I will not lie to you, it won't look good. Put your personal effects in here. - A mobile? - Yes. Your jewellery too. Place your right hand there. Come this way. Remove your clothes and get ready to be searched. To be searched? What's the matter? Are you OK? No. I don't understand what's happening to me. Is this your first time? Yes. Come on! Hurry up. Open the curtains! You look terrible. You've lost more weight. I did some shopping. There's enough food for 2 days. I don't feel very hungry. Force yourself! You can't get sick. - What's the point? - Jacqueline wants you to be strong. What the hell's this? It's from the landlord. "Eviction Notice"? Don't worry, It'll be fine. Listen. I didn't mention it before because of Bernard. I was afraid he'd be reluctant. Not at all. He agreed immediately. We can't abandon you. It'd be like letting down Jacqueline. And there's no way. We have a spare room. It's best you come and stay. I'll be fine. If you're hoping for more time, you're kidding yourself. - It'll work out OK. - No. It won't work out. But when they evict you, you'll know where to go. I'll get the room ready for you. I'll come by tomorrow. If you need anything, my phone's on. Bad news. The court rejected the appeal. What does that mean? You'll be held till the trial. I will do my best to get the earliest possible date. Here it is. It's open. Apparently, no one is home. - What are you doing? - Writing my summons. - I'll put it under the door. - Is that it? I can't do anything more. I have a copy of the keys. You can't let yourself in. They should have vacated the premises 2 months ago. I want no part of this. Never mind. Here we are! Right, outside! Damn! Damn! Sir! Sir! - Hello, madam. - Hello, Mrs Escandier. I wanted to see you today because I have some bad news. Attempted suicide. Don't you worry. She's in good hands now. - Have you seen her? - No, but I've had news. She's doing well. She's regained consciousness, and she's OK. God, it's dreary! You don't come here for fun, but to convalesce. Know how much it costs a day? Hello. - Jérôme and Xavier Croizet. - To see your brother? - No. To see the manager. - I'll take you. We know the way. Go see him. Remember the power of attorney. - Yes! - Room 23. You have a visitor. Thank you. - Did I wake you up? - It doesn't matter. With the pills, I sleep 18 hours a day. Like a cat. Are you alone? Jérôme and Xavier are with the manager. I fear the worst. I understand, but you cannot have someone committed just like that. Now hang on... There is a lot at stake here. If he were committed, we would get power of attorney. I advise you not to put forward that argument to just anyone. People might doubt your motives. We are acting in his best interest. Imagine he falls into the hands of unscrupulous individuals. Yes. You're right. Thank you for coming to see me. I'm fond of you. And I'm on a mission. I have to make you sign this. They think if it's me, you won't be so wary. - What is it? - Power of attorney. So they can rip you off more. It's all they talk about. The circumstances are in their favour. Not only. What do you mean? They paid an investigator to set you up. - Will you help me? - Yes. I'll sign the document. It'll calm them down. And I'll give you a letter to post for me. Make an effort. In a week, we go before the judge. I'll do what I can, madam. But something is broken inside of me. Unfortunately, it's irreparable. I understand. Right. You have a week to gather your strength. Alright? Here. Hide it. I am not supposed to give you your mail. Thank you. "Jacqueline, "The day I came into your life, "I never imagined the trouble I would cause you. "The nastiness of my family has sapped "my morale and taken your freedom. "I finally know why our lives have taken a bad turn. "My mother and brothers hired an investigator to set you up "and so erase any hope I had "of believing in who I really am." Spontaneously, we would all tend to be indulgent. Jacqueline Escandier is a person who inspires confidence, a person whom it is hard not to instantly like. And she also has the benefit of a trouble-free past. But if crooks and pimps all looked the part and had the reputation they deserve, would there be so many victims? The virtues you believe she possesses, because of her kind face, must convince you to punish her severely. For she has used them as arms of corruption. The defence may speak. During her long and irreproachable life, Jacqueline Escandier has made a single mistake. Because she is too kind, too human and too gullible. - She let herself to be led... - To be led? That isn't it at all. - You haven't understood anything. - Allow me to defend you. May I, Your Honour? This is original. I wish to explain myself. My client would like to express herself. - Go ahead, madam. - Thank you. Right... Stand up, please. Stand up. When the police came to arrest me at home, I initially thought it was a bad joke. I very quickly understood it wasn't a joke at all. For the past 4 months, I have been living a nightmare, someone else's nightmare. I am fighting accusations which have nothing to do with my private life. Nothing. Your Honour, if I may, I would like to explain what actually happened. Jacqueline! Oh, Cécile! You've lost weight. I've made up a room for you. No, no. I'd rather you took me to the station. - I'm going on a trip. - To rest? - To settle my scores. - I don't like the idea. Don't worry, I'm in no danger. You could even say I've paid in advance. Are you here to mock us? After 4 months in custody, I've no time to lose. If it wasn't for you, I could've saved my son. By locking him up in the loony bin? - You turned him against us. - No. I looked on him kindly and I tried to understand. You see, it's simple. Anyone else could do the same. Excuse me, I'm expected. If it's compensation you're after, it's a waste of time. Compensation? I would never even have thought of it. No. I have come to ask you for some advice. Contracts, sales agreements, drafts... You know about all that. So... what do you think of this? It's a publishing contract. To tell my story. Well, ours. I have also been contacted by two television shows. All of this is excellent for me. Maybe less so for you. How will your clientele react? Mind you, one never knows, they may be broad-minded. You think you can intimidate us? Intimidate men like you? Come off it! No. Well? What's your decision? A friendly agreement or the media spotlight? There's a name for what you're doing. Yes. It's called blackmail. You know about that too. You called me, Mother? Is that woman still here? I don't know why I don't call the police chief. Last time, it wasn't a great success. The superintendent did his duty. As did the judge. But the court was a farce. You can't promise everyone to advance their careers. Since we agree, will a cheque do? Perfectly. No. Make it out to Jean. - But he's... - In the clinic, I know. Get him out. Mother says dinner is at 7. Will you be dining with us? I don't think so. - Another time maybe? - Maybe. Thank you for her. - Shall I call a taxi? - It's done. It was a bit dear, but we got off lightly. Blackmail, extortion... There are laws against it. - And with a good lawyer... - Ah no! Don't you start again! May I ask you what you find so amusing? It's indiscreet, but I'll tell you anyway. - It's life I find amusing. - It isn't always funny. Ah! That's for sure. Sometimes it's hilarious. Today, for instance. - Room 23, please. - Come with me. Thank you. Jacqueline! I never thought I'd see you. That you didn't get my letter. Sorry, Belinda, I was delayed. Minor problems, nothing serious. My darling. You hurt yourself. You had a bad time too. No worse than here. How about we pack your bags? I love to see you smile. They'll never let me out. Want to bet? - Do come in. - Thank you. The two rooms connect. - Enjoy your stay. - Thank you. It's wonderful! So how do you feel? You know, when I was in there, I never imagined I could be this happy. I'll let you into a secret too. I didn't either. It really suits you. Want to drop your bag at the hotel? There's no point. I won't need it in Brazil. Brazil? I've never seen anyone fantasize so much about beaches and samba. Tell me, are you still sure about the operation? We'll see. I haven't given up on the idea. BRAZIL At the top end, there's Copacabana Palace. There are more affordable options. This, for instance. That's beautiful! Very beautiful. If you book it now, I can give you a discount. Maybe we'll think about it for a day or two. To your success! Do you realize how far you have gone since we first met? We did it together. And it isn't over. Is that so? Remember what I told you at the beginning, when you wanted me to leave? No. I said, "I feel happy here. - "I don't want to leave." - That's right! It's you I feel happy with. Wherever we are. At your age, you can start over absolutely anywhere. But at mine, it's much harder, Belinda. Imagine what would've happened to me if we hadn't met. You were providence. Providence doesn't exist. Nor do providential encounters. It's all nonsense. It just makes you regret things and prevents you from grabbing life by the horns. Hang on. Where were you? Here! I don't believe it. Come on, pack your bag. Thank you! You didn't tell me how it ended with Ricardo. One day, a new trapeze artist turned up. You know, trapeze artists are a special breed. It all seems mysterious up there, from the ground. And then, of course, one day I understood. Were you really hurt? All passionate affairs come to an end. I think that's sad. Not really. In life, what you've had, you've had. And that never leaves you. Believe me. You travel light. It's 35C in the shade over there. I'll buy myself some summer dresses. Right, I'm ready. Wow! Hello! - Nothing to check in? - Just hand luggage. You'll be boarding at Gate 22. Where's Gate 22? - That way. - Thank you. Apparently, it's 38C. I don't like this bit. Take a deep breath. Which queue do we choose? On the right. The young man has a nice face. The other. - She knows about discrimination. - OK. Hello. Are you, Jean Croizet? Yes. It needs to be changed. The paperwork is being done. Next time, it'll say Belinda. Belinda is a lovely name. Thank you. Hello. What are you thinking about? Over there. What we'll discover when we get there. - Are you nervous? - A bit, yes. With the life you've had, you're not scared. My life is not unusual. A circus comes to town, you decide to follow it. Not everyone would dare. - You said it. - What? A circus came to town, I didn't follow it. I don't understand. I told you about the life I would have liked to have. And how it could have been, if I'd had a bit of courage. Sorry. Ricardo never existed? Oh yes! And Ricardo still exists. I have never been able to forget him. We only saw each other 4 times. But 4 unforgettable times. I don't believe it! Calling passengers in rows 15 to 29. On our second date, he asked me to follow him. I said I'd think about it. But he never asked me again. He'd understood I'd never have the guts to drop everything. We never said goodbye, and he was right. There you go! That's the truth. Sorry. But this? That? I don't remember who said, "Life is worth nothing, but nothing is worth life." It took that for me to understand. Calling passengers in rows 25 to 59. Why are you telling me all this now? Look, you are lucky to know what you want. So go for it! You never regret what you have done. But what you haven't done. So go for it! Bon voyage. Hello. So this is new for you too. We'll have a great fun. That's one way of looking at it. Go ahead. Hello, madam. I'm not coming. What's got into you? I promised to accompany you until you no longer needed me. You've just crossed that line. This is where we say goodbye. - Did you check in a bag? - No. May I see your boarding card? - Thank you. - You can't do this to me. - Not now. - I have one passenger less. Be confident. Yes, she's here. Everything will be fine. But I can't go without you. Of course you can. Look, you're not breaking down. You'll get used to it. It'll go smoothly. You're not leaving? She's leaving. Off you go! Go live your life. Go on! I'm closing the boarding gates. It'll work out. Go! Don't forget. Your name's Belinda. - Hello. - Gosh, you travel light. - Where were you? - In Brazil.
