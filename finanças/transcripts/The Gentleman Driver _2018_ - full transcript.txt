But, ultimately, the piece of humanity that you plug into all of that technology does make the difference, and that's why this is such a great sport. And yet, we still have the gentleman driver competing. So the difference between winning and losing is your gentleman driver, which I find fascinating. We had a two-lap lead and I was tasked with something pretty simple - bringing the car home. I think mentally I was there. Unfortunately, physically I didn't get the job done, and it's a high price to pay. Given how competitive this championship is, we haven't been able to recover. Gentleman drivers are drivers that are not professional, that are rich. They have lots of money. More money than sense. While there is good talent in the field, there is also questionable talent, questionable moves that happened during the race. Some of them are better than others from what I can see. I've read it does cause a little bit of... consternation with some of the more professional drivers sometimes. A gentleman driver is somebody that pays for their drive rather than somebody paying them. I wish I was rich enough to be one, too, but I'm not. I believe that gentleman drivers are part of the living tradition of this whole racing. They're flamboyant. They're not quite as programmed. They still do things wrong. The crowd loves people who screw up and spin the cars, just occasionally. Thank God we have a few gentleman drivers to do that for us. And quite often the guys who could afford cars were quite wealthy, so the original racing drivers, ultimately, were all gentleman drivers. There were no pros in those days. Because if you have the wherewithal, you could buy a baseball team, you could buy an NFL franchise, but can you go out and quarterback it on a Sunday? Of course you can't. It would be ridiculous. Rich businessmen just doing it for fun at the weekends, it's hard to do that now. In fact, it may be impossible. He's had to make that change to make his performance level appropriate to the World Championship. Definitely racing is an addiction. You are taking risks, you're working off hours, you're travelling. It's not easy. It's not easy. So if you want to be there and you want to be good at it, it has to be passion. We're all drivers and we're all passionate about it. Some guys just started when they were six years old, and some of us picked it up later in life, but I've always wanted to be the best at whatever I've tried to do. As an entrepreneur, and certainly now in the racing world, you know, it's a pretty demanding audience of one, frankly. You have to look in the mirror at the end of the day and say, "Did I get it done or not?" I think I'm motivated and I push hard, but when I hear other people speak about me, they seem to think I push to the point of just insanity. But I just think it's normal. For me, it's just what you have to do. "Better than him, her, them. Better than I just did it." And the quest for perfection is something that motor racing is pretty much all about. We have all this data from two years ago, and then my data from this last Friday. So what you do is you overlay it. My steering traces, my brake pressures and my throttle, turn one, all the way through turn 20. This data is absolutely imperative. You're talking a tenth of a second here, a tenth of a second there. Twenty laps, or 20 corners, one tenth of a second is two seconds, right? It's all data-driven - everything. Business is and this is. I got my profit-and-loss statements in via email last night, so I'm forecasting taxes. That's what I was doing in my room. I thought I was taking time off, but I really was doing analysis on my accounting. Now, as of this morning, I turned that all off, and now I'm on data here. So my life goes from one to the next. It just never stops. Never stops. Without the injection of finance that they bring, some of the teams simply wouldn't be able to exist and go racing. I think that gives something to the sport. It doesn't take something away, it adds. And I think that's what brings in some of the fans, because they look at that and think, "If only I had the money, I would be doing exactly the same thing." None of these corners are really late apexes, Ricky. What's your braking point? It's seventy five. It's deep. You kind of brake-release, carrying speed into the apex, looking for the apex. This extra speed at the rear will help you turn the car. To take the gentleman driver to a track walk is really important, because we, as pro drivers, help explain to them how to take each corner. You know, they look at corners like racing drivers, but sometimes they also look at corners as businessmen. He's actually showing me on the computer where to brake. I don't know if he's right or not. We'll see tomorrow. Ultimately, the car and the stopwatch doesn't know whether it's a gentleman driver in that car or someone who's a superstar. Once the helmet's on, it makes no difference. As a race-car driver sent off down the pit lane, you might have 20 seconds to get yourself sorted out, then off with the pit-lane speed limiter and everything's going to happen at 100% straight away, because if it's not, you're losing time to your competitors. Now, the pro drivers do that as a matter of course. The best amateur drivers build up to that. In WEC, we're racing with top teams, so there's a lot to be learned, and I think it would be an error not to be like a sponge. I don't remember this being so downhill. You don't feel it in the car. Downhill is great for you, because the more weight, the faster you go. The first time I'll be faster than you. Human beings are a competitive species - we cooperate in teams, but we have always competed against the other. Now, an entrepreneur is in a very competitive environment, because in order to succeed, they actually have to allow their company to do better than everybody else. When you extend yourself in a new area, it actually feeds back on what you do professionally, because you realize, "Hey, I was able to acquire this new skill, so why can't I solve some big problem that I'm facing in the workplace? I know I can do it, because I'm able to do it in these other areas." I think what joins racing and business for me is... being able to take that pressure, and then perform the same. That's when life said, "No more." No more sponsorship, there's no more support. I had two kids already, so I had to focus back on work. It definitely was not easy, but I was sure I could do it. Seven years later, an opportunity to race came back, and my business partner sponsored me. And it was after the first or second race that I realized I cannot do it just to have fun. I have to be competitive. I like to think where I want to be, what I want to accomplish, and then understand how I get there. And sometimes I just drop a lot of ideas. I think if you want to really help and leave something behind for Mexico, and revolutionize education in Mexico - which is what Mexico needs right now - for me, this was the opportunity to do that. This is the student union. We are here. And in here we have the cafeteria. All this will be a huge new city. You become the bridge, basically - the academic to the corporate side. Ricardo, this is phenomenal. I mean, it's unbelievable. We talked about this maybe 60 days ago. The progress you've made in 60 days, incredible. It's incredible. - Every week it changes. - That's right. Some days he's in China, and when he finishes racing he texts, "How is everything over there?" I think he doesn't sleeps. There's a whole team behind you, there's people working for you, there's a contract. Being under that pressure at that age, it definitely starts to prepare you. The racing world, it's a small circle. Basically, everybody knows each other. One big circus that travels around the world together. Even though we're different teams and competing against each other, one year you'll be with one team, another year you'll be with another team, so you become friends with the people you were racing against the year before. For me, the thing that racing has provided, which is a weird thing, is... sort of an escape, almost, right? It's provided a mental shift. So, it's taken me a number of years to be able to go there and just completely forget everything else. I don't know when you started if you felt that? You would come to the track, doing your business, in the middle of... That's what I loved about it, though, because if I wanted to play golf, or did whatever, somebody could email me, text me, or call me. In the race car they can't do that, so it was the biggest release I ever had. People don't understand. I'm more relaxed in the race car than when I'm not. For me, also, I will leave my cell phone for three or four hours. Going to races, it's a shift, completely, everything. What's been good for me in racing in Europe is that the time... We're so far ahead. Basically, when the day's over, the day starts in California. So I don't have to watch my phone all day. No one's emailing me because no one's awake. So... when I'm over there, during the day, it's really relaxing. If I can control the evenings, I'll be OK. Get the results, rack up the points, and hopefully, by the time we get to Bahrain, then you're in a pretty good state to challenge for the championship. Ricardo tries to focus on the racing, but a secret project that Ricardo and I have been working on is to bring a WEC event to Mexico, which would be huge. Mexico's a huge market for racing and for all the manufacturers involved. There's a lot that happens at a racetrack that has nothing to do with racing. It's all business, and vice versa. I'm pretty good. I don't get in for another hour or so. I stay calm until I get my helmet on, and then I'll probably get, you know, a little anxious. Tell Ed if he starts complaining... It felt like the suspension fell out of the car sometimes. - From the fender, came down. - Oh, no kidding? - Yeah, huge. - Yeah. -So tell Ed he's got to drive through it. -Drive through it. Looked like a good hit. - Yeah. - They're showing it again. Shit. He doesn't have any brakes? Oh, my God. Good thing he didn't roll. He said no brakes. That's what it looked like on the video, so we'll see. I actually was moving good through 19. You got some serious air. I mean, that went way up. I never saw. The other problem was when I hit, the steering wheel flew off and hit me in the chest. -The steering wheel? -It came off. Holy shit. We're going to take it down there and look at it. - Sure you're OK? - Yeah. So, it's halfway through the race. About three hours left. Ricardo just finished his stint, so he's done for the day. Ricardo was in fourth place when he came in. Right now I think we're in sixth place, but it's hard to tell because people have to pit still. Usually, when you see that, it means there's some kind of mechanical problem. So, you know, it sucks for them. But their other car's running pretty good, so at least Patrón will be happy. When it's a mechanical failure like that, you know, it's part of racing, and you just hope that we can find the issue that happened, and hopefully never let it happen again. I'm drinking Patrón and relaxing, taking a little of the bruising away. For us to be one and three, I think it's very good news for the team. Winning is important to me, and definitely that's why I'm here - I like to win. And it's not that you're going to go and get that podium or that trophy at the end of the day, but you get a longer version of it, so... Anything you do in the business world, and how you develop yourself, will stay with you for the rest of your life. Oh, my God! I always tell my employees, "In really good times you learn absolutely nothing. It all went right, so what did you have to learn?" It's in the hard times when you fail that you learn the most. Whether it's failure to run a lap time that I wanted to run or a brand that didn't do as well as I thought it would, I learn, and I learn every single day at everything that I do. So that's important. Without failure, you can't have success. And that may help you to succeed in school, but it doesn't really help you to succeed in life, because success in life isn't about never making mistakes, it's about recovering from the mistakes that you make. People who succeed over and over again in different areas aren't just lucky. They're good at making mistakes, sometimes even failing, and then learning from those failures and using that knowledge to help them move forward. Do you think trial eight in a higher proof, with more bite and nose might...? I haven't done eight. I'm going to eight now. It doesn't have much of a smoke at all. Not much smoke on the nose, no. That's always the question we've had internally - how much smoke we're going to put in there. I think the taste, for me, it's a little soft. Yeah, it's soft. I just don't know if it's a big enough difference to go ask for $30 or $20 a bottle more. - What's the proof on that? - That's 80 proof, right? - Yes. - Forty percent, right? - Yes. - I think a little hotter. An 85 would be... a full brand. Let's taste a range of... Let's... A percentage of 40-45. Fifty... Forty, 41, 42, 43, 44... Hey, I like 50s, but I don't want to go back to the days when kids were falling off of barstools. I'm passionate, and I'm... uber competitive, you know. And I think that's kind of what's always driven me. My dad gave me the worst territory known to man in Colorado, and I was making, I think, $15,000 a year. I'm like, "Dad, I can't survive on this." So... after about six months I was working for him, a company called Seagram's came knocking and said, "Hey, you want to work for us?" They're going to pay me $22,500. "That's a deal. I'm out of here." And they gave me a van, so I didn't have to have a car. So all that set me up to really do what I thought I was going to be really good at, and that's not really having to work for somebody, and, you know, using all that I hope I've learned over the years to build something. But I had this idea, "If I can have a car going around a track with Patrón all over it, I'm going to get it on television." So, Scott Sharp and I became close and I started sponsoring him, and he kept saying, "You need to get in a race car." I said, "I don't have time." For the next four days, we're going to teach you how to drive it." He goes, "You've got to get into bigger horsepower." And so that was when Sharp and I decided... I won't mention names. I've been with a lot of team owners over the years. They all lose their stomach for spending the money, because racing's expensive. And so, you know, Scott and I decided at that time, "Hey, why don't we start our own team? But it's always been Sharp shoving me along. You know, the number-one thing is teamwork, on both sides, right? A lot of the gentleman drivers have seen success in their business lives. They will have seen failure, too. I think that's quite important, because when they come to this sport failure is more likely. -Well, you had good laps going into here. -Yeah. I mean, you had a bunch of 57s. -I just need to get it right. -Yeah. I'm like, "No, no, no. Please. I'm just a worker here. Be brutally honest." I've been very fortunate that teammates and engineers, they will call me out. - That will work out. - Yeah. - I can run 57s. - I know, they were just saying. - Just, I can't-- - What's that? -That's that fast right. -We're going to get you flat. -You've just got to suck it. -I know I was turning in too early. You've got to go way right and then come back way left. A late apex across that hill. Make yourself believe, especially if you're on good tires. Drive all the way down to that sign before you park it and turn. -I hate that turn. -You've got to go to the sign. -There's no vision there. -The sign. The sign's the key. And not only is it just good for you, generally speaking, as a human being, to have to be humble and occasionally embarrassed because you don't do things as well as your comrades, but also you discover that they have talents you didn't suspect. And I, for example, was amazed at how clever my co-drivers were at handling the media, for example. I was doing this every day as a CEO, but these guys had a way of talking back to the journalists. I thought, "I've got a lot to learn, even in things I thought I knew how to do." -Get him in the race. -That's right. The most humble people tend to be the most confident. The people who are able to say, "You know what? In this situation you have more expertise than I do, so please tell me what to do, or give me some advice so that I can do what I'm doing better," they're the ones who have the most confidence in their ability because by giving you the opportunity to instruct them, they don't feel like they are being seen as a lesser individual. And that's what makes people successful across a whole range of different endeavors. I mean, I blew the esses twice. I came in way too hot. And then... Then I started getting a bit of pace, but... You picked it up better through the esses. Right, well, I need a little help sometimes, and it's nice to hear where I'm blowing it, so... Honestly, I used to prefer when I did racing that was just me and the car. Mm-hmm. Because, at the end of the day, if I screwed up, it was all on me. For me, before getting in a car, if you ask me, "Do you get nervous?" I do, but it's because I want to deliver. I don't want to be the guy who drops the ball. -I don't want to disappoint my teammates. -Yeah. Like when Johannes tells me... You know, he grabs me and he'll tell me he's proud of me - that's greater than anything I do in business. -You know? -No question. Because here's a guy that drives for a living and he was happy with what I did, you know? But I think for the gentleman driver, that's huge pressure - that when you drive with a pro, you just don't want to disappoint them, and you don't want to be the guy that screws up the race, you know? We're in Bahrain for the final round of the 2015 FIA World Endurance Championship, the last 6 Hours of the season, and all bar two championships are still up for grabs. It's been a real return to form for Aston Martin in the last couple of races, and here in Bahrain I would think that Paul will be looking for at least a podium and possibly even a win. This is actually probably our busiest weekend, as far as business goes, outside the racetrack. I'm here trying to put together Ricardo's team for next year, and my main focus right now is how I can get the best combination of Ricardo as a gentleman driver and our pro drivers. We're also finalizing the deal for the WEC race in Mexico next year, so it's coming down to the wire. Every time we get a few free minutes, we're talking to people or negotiating deals. You either drive or focus on business. You can't do both at the same time. You know, the butterflies are up, I'm really not sure how those first couple of laps are going to be, so just trying to calm down a little bit. I missed the autograph session and missed driver-change practice. We were doing emails through the night, sending corrections, and at 8:00 a.m. I received a final copy of the contract, signed it and went to bed. You're going to be in for just over your minimum hour and 20, so those tires are going to have to last. - Easy on them the first couple of laps. - OK. Bring them in, just don't slide them. They don't have to last forever. One of the suspension members in the left-rear broke on both cars, so we need to investigate why that happened and make sure it doesn't happen again. I didn't love a whole lot about racing this past year, but... after the season, I started to analyze what I need to do as a driver to go now to the next couple of levels. But I really don't want to do it if I can't win. So an outside chance at a win, but more than likely a podium and third overall in the championship this year. It goes back to Le Mans. When I got out of the car they said, "Hey, you were... hauling ass." We are at risk of missing that flight. But is the airport closer to here or closer to the hotel? There's no debate. You are going on the podium as well. -No, no, no. -You absolutely are! Listen, we've sent one of the boys, and they will meet you at the airport. Or we just go there and... -Just risk it. Just risk it. -Yeah. The option is that we have to go to the 2:05 flight or whatever. -Risk it. It doesn't happen very often. -OK. -That's true. -You know what to do, the procedure. We give you a little top. Everyone's happy. -Are you happy with it? -Let's see. Let's see. Let's go. Thank you. Being home and being available on a Monday morning is a huge priority. Not so much the glory - although it's nice to be acknowledged - but I get more satisfaction out of my competitors acknowledging that here's this person that was a late starter, maybe in some ways shouldn't even be here, and yet is up on the podium celebrating and achieving these results. There's a spectrum of behaviors that is called "Imposter Syndrome," and it's the idea that you've risen to a particular level, but if people really knew who you were, they might realize that you don't deserve that. And for people who are in that situation, it's actually rarer for someone to work hard and succeed than it is for people to give in to that. It's much easier to give in. And more recently, probably in the last ten years, we've come to focus almost exclusively on healthcare real estate. Which is a bit strange, because in Canada we have a public health system, and the provincial governments own the vast majority of healthcare real estate - you know, hospitals and the like. So, over the last ten years, we've really become a very significant owner of healthcare real estate in Europe, Australia, New Zealand, South America, and, of course, in Canada. Clearly, completing the merger with NorthWest International was the biggest thing we've been able to accomplish. I mean, I think that leaves us in a great position, but how do we make it even better? What do we think about further down the line? So, you know, maybe thinking past 2016 and the big opportunities for the business. Yeah. I started NorthWest with one property, and really running it by myself with a cell phone and no office, to now, you know, having hundreds of people working for the company and hundreds of properties. So it's been an incredible journey, and I think as a public company now, as an entrepreneur, and in particular as a person in charge of the strategy for the business, I find myself wearing two hats every day coming in here. "Are we on plan and are we capable of both hitting our quarters and our year?" And at the same time being the chief disruptor, coming in and saying, "Let's think about what we could do totally differently. How could this be 10X?" So it's a very interesting tension, and I find that to be really rewarding. I would say I'm an accidental gentleman driver, in that although I have enjoyed racing over the years, and I can remember even meeting my wife at a Formula 1 event, my journey into the sport happened quite recently. That was, you know, going to a track day with a friend, having never driven a car on a racetrack, never done go-karting. I showed up as green as you can be, and I think after the first lap I knew that it was something that I wanted to do, and enrolled the next week in racing school, and started the week after that. So it was a real eye-opener that I had a whole lot to learn. -Howard, nice to see you. Thanks. -Paul, great to see you. The Dalla Lana School of Public Health is one of the world's leading institutions for training and research in population health. You take that and say, "Here's what we're putting together. We're still working out the final details, but you need to have this in your budget. The estimated cost will be US$300,000." Right? So they take that 300,000, that becomes a placeholder in their budget for 2016. So it's like, "Here are the contemplated assets, here's the price, and we'll have the final packages to you by March 31st." Yeah, and what we can say is that whoever buys those is going to be in it for three years... -It's a three year deal. -If you want to be in, it's now or... But the sales hook is saying that there are only so many packages, right? You know, there's one title sponsor, and that's sold. There's one presenting sponsor, and there are, you know, five or six of these. I don't want anything under 300,000. There's appetite, so we don't want to be selling for less than that. Right. And what happens if we run out of packages? - You add more. - What? - You add more. - If you sell out... we can always... - That's a good problem to have. - We can... It's going to happen. Is it different now than when it was a start-up - the drive of it? So, here's me - I'm competitive. And... So I sit there and I'm like, "Wow, Patrón's worth X amount of billions. That's awesome. But how did this guy with a stupid little Internet company... He's worth 40 billion?" And it... motivates me, and it drives me, and it drives me crazy. So it pushes me to continue to say, "OK, I've got to keep pushing." To me, it's not about the money. It's more about winning or losing. It's like, whether it's racing or business, or whatever, I want to win. The business is business. It's kind of just... For me, it's more about... It's the means to an end, you know? It's basically just a tool so I get to do all the things I really want to do. You said that when you retired, you sold your company... Yeah, I sold my company, and then I started racing. What are you going to do, right? Sit around and garden? No way. I loved the early days of Patrón. I don't get to do the things I loved to do, like working in the bars and showing people why it was better and stuff like that, but that's what happens. Would you give up the money, go back and do that? - Probably not. - Yeah. We're going to get it all soaking wet, muddy and crappy. It is what it is. It's important, because we've got potential sponsors coming, we have lots of customers coming, so we need to show well. So far... less than 25 minutes in, we're running first and second. There were a couple of shunts we dodged. Then, luckily, I was able to get up into P1... and then pulled a little gap. So all is going well so far, but it's only one hour of the race gone, and there's a long way to go. Last year, I was only a driver. I got to have a lot of fun with my teammates. Very young teammates, actually - 21 and 25 years old. Yeah, and not being happy with the extra work of team owner, I'm now the promoter for the Mexico race, and that's very exciting. I haven't driven this car on this track at all, so... I'll just take it easy, because you see all the yellow and red flags. Everyone's going off. If you try to be a hero, it's not going to do you any good. One more pit stop, which is about a 40-second pit stop. So we're getting it right now, and under yellow, which is perfect. So if we get it out here, we're going to put five gallons in it. A little splash and go. There you go, right now. That was close. Those fuckers almost caught us. - They fucked up our fuel! Unbelievable! - ...next time. Let's go to the podium, get some champagne. Right now we're second, but Pipo over there pitted early for some reason, which is strange, but I think that's good for us. Things are looking pretty good. Ricardo's going to go in now, and we'll see how he goes. He's going to do his first stint as a team owner. That seat is so fucking bad. So fucking bad. So, I had to lift myself up, you know, to pull my butt down in a corner. It's terrible. I think that was my worst stint ever, I've got to tell you. -I got punted off twice. -Yeah. -Then I made a couple of mistakes. -You were running consistently. For a bit, and then I just... It's just frustrating. I really feel like I left a lot out there, so... I'd say at least 25 seconds for mistakes. We've got 18 minutes to go and we're leading right now. So it's a little nerve-wracking right now, but we might start our team with a win in our first race ever. You have to... give credit to people when they deserve it. I love working with the team, and just getting in the car, and just trying to do the max out of what you have... and then sharing that with teammates - I think that's what I enjoy. It's not that much about winning or not winning. It's just being there, being part of it. There's a lot of research on the relationship between being an entrepreneur and what's called your risk tolerance. And it might look from the outside like entrepreneurs are willing to be more risky than most people. My guess is that most of these gentleman drivers don't see what they're doing as being all that risky. What they see is that they are engaging something that would be risky if they hadn't actually spent a lot of time learning how to do it properly. For one thing, I'm not a gambler. I don't feel like any of this is a gamble. I look at these as very intelligent decisions - just that you need to do these things to go forward. It's slightly risky spending millions of dollars building a new facility in a new industry that's not regulated yet, but I try to look at the future and make a calculated decision, and then don't look back. We have four-hour, six-hour, 12-hour, 24-hour races. You don't take big risks. So it's worked out well for my personality. Get in there, go 90-95% all the time. But going 100-105%, that's risky and not for me. We're now in charge of the branding of the new Smith &amp; Baxter line. We're now on version three. Once we do the physical mockup, we have to see if it changes the look and feel on some of these. So, the other alternative was just to do this square block for the flavors. But I do like the way we've color-coded the flavors, too. They're very, very adult, and we don't see a lot of that in the industry. I agree. I agree. I'm happy with this, and I think the next round would be changing these up, getting some iterations here, and I think we're going to be good to go. So I grew up in that business, but after a few years I realized there's something better for me. I didn't know what it was, but I knew that was not my calling. So I sold all that off and went into the consulting business to the industry, and I taught all these cleaning companies service techniques and sales techniques, because I was really good at it. So that's when I started to get a feel for the chemical industry, because I worked for chemical companies selling into the cleaning industry. I just thought manufacturing something and shipping it out in volume, and seeing pallets and trucks of stuff going out the back door, that was just, to me, extremely cool. So I said, "I want to be in this business." I ended up making millions of dollars doing it, and that allowed me the time and the ability to go back to racing, because I had put it on hold for 20 years. But at about 25 or 26, after a number of years of racing different things - Jet Skis, motorcycles - doing very well as an amateur, could turn pro... it just didn't make sense. Financially, I would never make a living out of it, so I said, "That's not going to work." So I bought race cars and semis, got a building, and I spent a million bucks - whatever it was - and built a whole marketing business around this race team. That was a big mistake. I got my ass kicked. Flat-out kicked. Embarrassingly kicked. Last place by, you know, 20 seconds. This is my simulator that I use for practicing before I go to a racetrack I don't know, essentially to learn the track, learn the corners, the braking points. This is Silverstone, which we just raced a few weeks ago. We won, and I think the simulator is a big part of why, because I know the track before I get there. People have said it doesn't matter when you start. Start at five years old, you're good at 15. You start at 25, you're good at 35. It just takes you ten years to figure it out, and I didn't start until I was 45-46 years old. If they're getting better than I am at the time, I'm going backwards. Have you guys ever decided to take a big risk and completely had it go really wrong in business? My race team. Yes, I think you're right. That's the only way you can become a millionaire. You're a billionaire, you open a race team, then you're a millionaire. Yeah. You think you know it all and then you try it. Oh, my God. Not very profitable, the race team, so far. If you're trying to make money on the race team, stop. No, no, no. I know that's not going to make money. Not only because we're the only Mexican team, but actually because Ricardo's the promoter of this race, which means that he pretty much made all this happen. He's building a university, he's a team owner, he runs an insurance company, and now he is planning an event for 45,000 people. It makes it extra special because I've got 600 employees coming to watch. For them to come here and have some cocktails, it's going to be a day they won't forget. I just had very little sleep the last three or four weeks. So I'm ready to start changing my hat into the driver hat. I think people are pretty impressed with what we have done, and this is helping me a lot to forget my promoter duties. Ricardo, expecting a huge crowd... The numbers sound really, really enthusiastic. How is that going to lift your team, carrying the Mexican flag? It's going to be pressure. I know how Mexicans go wild, so we're going to enjoy that. Ricardo is very stressed on the radio. He wants a drive-through for Rusinov. Our car is fine. It's racing, but we need to keep it cool. I think we've lost five laps now, so a very frustrating way to end up. Just hoped it wasn't going to be us. It's raining in sections of the track. A three-second gap, so it's nerve-wracking right now. Come on! Woo-hoo-hoo! Nice, huh? Woo! You jumped in big this year. Going from just racing and being on a team to having your own team, you know, that's a big jump. Yeah, but the event took a toll on me, physically and time-wise. You know, we noticed that, because you won the race and shit like that. They feel real bad for you.
