our journey begins at Hyde Park mansion the summer home at the Vanderbilt family on the Hudson River about a hundred miles upstream from New York which is just one of the many great houses overlooking the river heading south we take in West Point Military Academy as well as the famous Golf Club and a notorious prison facility at Sleepy Hollow we take a look at the old Dutch Church in Washington Irving's creepy tale before looking at two more 19th century mansions the brother then takes us down to the city that never sleeps New York the Hudson River flows for 315 miles through New York and is named after Henry Hudson who explored it in 1609 in the late 19th century during what has become known as the Gilded Age many beautiful large mansions were built for wealthy industrialists along the river Hyde Park mansion with its 54 rooms was home to Frederick William Vanderbilt and constructed in the beaux-arts architectural style from 1895 it was designed to be a seasonal country residence the house was very modern at the time and used concrete and steel in its construction electricity came from a private power house and the house even had hot air central heating the original estate was around 600 acres but in 1938 much of the land and the mansion were donated to the National Park Service two miles downriver is the Springwood estate which is the birthplace home and burial place of the 32nd President of the United States Franklin D Roosevelt the estate was bought by the president's father in 1866 who then enlarged the house it was further enlarged in 1915 so that the yet-to-be president could entertain his political friends he designed the two wings himself giving the house a Colonial Revival style the Roosevelt Library close to the house was the first presidential library built in the United States and was designed by the President himself in 1939 the Hudson River is still a busy waterway and navigable for much of its length with the opening of the Erie Canal further upstream goods could be transported between the City of Buffalo and the Great Lakes and the Port of New York the success of the waterway led to industrial growth along the river during the late 19th century however serious pollution problems of raw sewage and industrial wastes followed and it was only from the 1960s that anti-pollution legislation finally came into force when the cleanup effort could begin environmental protection was also important for the landscape overlooking the river the Hudson Highlands was saved and became a state park joined the mid 20th century as previously the area had been heavily locked and mined today the 6,000 acre park with its proximity to New York City is a popular destination for day hikes just downstream is the United States Military Academy at West Point at the oldest of the five such academies in the United States it was founded in 1800 and two with the motto duty honor country on the hill above West Point is for Putnam completed in 1778 to protect the Hudson join the Revolutionary War it was later enlarged but had gradually fallen into disuse by the mid 19th century around 65,000 cadets have graduated from West Point including several household names Custer Lee Sherman and Mead from a civil war from world war ii macarthur Bradley and Patton and also two presidents ulysses s grant and dwight d eisenhower George Washington is celebrated as America's first commander-in-chief who won independence for America before the Academy was founded in West Point's history there have been 74 recipients of the Medal of Honor the highest award for bravery in the United States on the opposite bank of the Hudson is the first railroad track to be built in the state of New York in 1831 the line was originally called the Mohawk and Hudson railroad and was built by Frederick William Vanderbilt whose house we saw earlier in 1853 the line became part of the much bigger New York Central Railroad today diesel locomotives carry commuters to and from Grand Central Station in New York on a 75 mile scenic stretch of track much of it running right next to the river in 1996 the Hudson National Golf Club opened up on the site of an old estate downstream from West Point and the mansion easily converted to the clubhouse the 260 acre site which now ranks in the top 100 golf clubs in America offers unrivaled views over the Hudson River the club is unusual in the players have to walk the course and only have use of a golf cart if over 60 years of age or physically infirm a very different sort of Club is a few miles downriver and one that you don't really want to join Sing Sing Correctional Facility this maximum-security prison came into being in 1824 over the years there have been 614 executions but in 1972 the death penalty was finally declared unconstitutional in the state of New York and the electric chair was removed today the prison houses around 2,000 inmates in 1996 North Tarrytown was renamed Sleepy Hollow when residents voted to have it changed to honor Washington Irvin story The Legend of Sleepy Hollow published in 1820 which was set in the town the story is still in print today over the decades the legend has been made into several films including Tim Burton's version in 1999 in the Legend of Sleepy Hollow the cemetery and old Dutch Church which is the oldest church in the state feature prominently in the tale where Ichabod Crane the new schoolmaster competes with a rival for the hand of Katrina Van Tassel when he leaves a party at the Van Tassel house he rides his horse gunpowder towards a wooden bridge close to the church and cemetery where he sees the Headless Horseman on the other side Irving writes in the dark shadow of the Grove on the margin of the brook he beheld something huge misshapen black and towering it stirred not but seemed gathered up in the gloom like some gigantic monster ready to spring upon the traveller Ichabod was never seen again but who was the horseman an evil spirit from the past in search of his head all was it echo Boggs rival The Legend of Sleepy Hollow leaves it up to the reader to decide on a hill above Sleepy Hollow is one of New York State's most famous houses built for the industrialist john d rockefeller who had made a fortune in the oil business commanding wonderful views over the Hudson it is named pyke it derived from the Dutch word

delivery tunnels and interconnecting passageways the garden is laid out in a series of terraces and in the park mature trees were transplanted at huge cost and placed into prominent positions the house is now open to the public and a National Historic Landmark in 1952 construction began on the Tappan Zee Bridge across the Hudson at its second widest point it's the first bridge upriver from the city of New York because it was built at a time of material shortages during the Korean War it was only meant to last for 50 years but together with an increase of traffic that was never envisaged the cantilever bridge is beginning to deteriorate and a new bridge is planned half a mile from the bridge is a Gothic Revival house begun in 1838 and today called Lyndhurst the original house was smaller and given the nickname Holdings folly after its builder William holding because of its unusual architectural style the second owner George Merritt a successful businessman doubled the size of the house in the 1860s and named it Lindenhurst after the linden trees on the estate in 1880 the house was purchased by railroad tycoon Jay Gould who added the first steel frame conservatory in the United States replanted the park and called the house Lyndhurst the house is still privately owned perhaps one of the most unusual properties to be built during the gilded period of the late nineteenth century is this domed octagonal house the armoire Steiner house it was named after its first two owners Paul Armour and Joseph Steiner Paul Armour built the octagonal house in 1860 but without a dome that was added by the second owner Joseph Steiner in the 1870s he also enlarged the house creating what we see today the design may well be unique in America and its exuberant style led to it being described as the tajmahal of the Hudson Valley and a pastry chefs nightmare 1976 the house was declared a national historic landmark our journey is fast approaching the city of New York and the river becomes a transport system the computers alongside the river and on the border with New Jersey is the Paris aids interstate Parkway a major route in and out of the city and now designated a national landmark construction began just after the Second World War in 1947 and was completed ten years later the parkway takes its name from the New Jersey Palisades a line of cliffs and the Hudson and behind the cliffs is the silhouette of one of the best known and best loved cities in the world New York with special permission from New York's air traffic control center to climb to 5,000 feet the whole of Manhattan is set out before us Manhattan is one of the five districts of New York City the others being the Bronx Queens Brooklyn and Staten Island but Manhattan the smallest of the five is the most densely populated and the heart of the city it's a major commercial financial and cultural center of the United States and the world this or inspiring site with its myriad of high-rise buildings looks simply spectacular from the air so one of the best ways to see New York without doubt has to be by helicopter and several companies operate passenger flights around the city some of them will include flying out to the Statue of Liberty surely one of the most famous statues in the world the gilded flame held aloft by the Statue of Liberty has been a symbol of freedom to millions of people around the world for over a hundred and twenty years the statue was to be a gift to the people of America from the people of France in 1876 in recognition of the friendship forged join the American Revolution but also to celebrate the centennial of the Declaration of Independence it was agreed that the base would be funded and built by America and placed on what is now Liberty Island following years of hard fundraising in both the US and France the statue eventually arrived in New York in 1885 the 350 individual pieces were packed 214 crates and took four months to assemble on a new pedestal on October the 28th 1886 the dedication ceremony took place in front of thousands of spectators and in 1984 the Statue of Liberty was declared a World Heritage Site by the United Nations close by is in its island the Gateway for millions of immigrants arriving in the new world and where roughly half the population of America can probably trace their families back to the center operated between 1892 and 1954 and the small island was gradually enlarged through land fill until 9/10 of it was artificial it is now a much visited museum tourist boats crisscross the harbor along with various ferries including the distinctive orange Staten Island ferries which pass Governors Island the name gets back to a time of British rule when the island was the exclusive preserve of New York royal governor's bridges are a distinctive feature of New York and the verts are no narrows bridge straddles the entrance to the harbour and joins Staten Island to Brooklyn the bridge is named after the Italian Explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano who was the first European to enter the harbour in 1524 it was completed in 1964 and at the time was the longest suspension bridge in the world in 1883 the Brooklyn Bridge was the longest suspension bridge in the world as well as the first to be built of steel the pedestrian walkway offers great views of the city and bridge it took 16 years to build and claimed the lives of 20 people including its designer John a Roebling most died of caisson disease known today as the bends after coming up too fast from the caissons below the East River the George Washington Bridge is the first across the Hudson who connects Washington Heights to Fort Lee in New Jersey the double-decker bridge was completed in 1931 and has 14 lanes for traffic by the year 2007 the bridge was carrying well over a hundred million vehicles a year also along the Hudson River is the New York passenger ship terminal which is also known as luxury liner row before the age of air travel this was where passengers would arrive at the great ocean liners from around the world even today around a million people arrived by ship each year and get superb views of the city before docking the East River separates Manhattan and Brooklyn on Long Island and was the busiest shipping channel in the early part of New York's history the Williamsburg Bridge was built in 1896 thirteen years after the Brooklyn Bridge overlooking East River is the United Nations headquarters built in 1950 and it stands on is considered to be international property a mile upstream and the River forks right under a Hell Gate Bridge before widening out at LaGuardia Airport and Rikers Island New York City's main jail complex the Harlem River forms part of the Hudson estuary system and serves as a narrow channel dividing the Bronx from Manhattan and over this short stretch of river are fourteen bridges close by are the old and new Yankee stadium's the farthest away built in 1923 and the nearest in 2006 the best-known open space in New York must be Central Park this 770 acre open space was completed by 1873 and is the most popular park in the United States one of its creators Frederick Olmsted said that it was of great importance as the first real Park made in this country a democratic development of the highest significance it took 16 years to create an involve planting around 500,000 trees and shrubs lakes were dark hills created Follies built formal Gardens laid out and bridges constructed the only building encroaching into the perfect rectangle is the Metropolitan Museum of Art begun in the 1870s at the southern end of Manhattan is the financial district which roughly overlaps the original New Amsterdam settlement of the 17th century and right on the end is Battery Park where the Dutch and then the British had an artillery fort district is home to major financial institutions including the Federal Reserve and the Stock Exchange it was also home to the twin towers until the tragedy of 9/11 and that appalling event meant that the Empire State Building was once again the tallest skyscraper in New York it was built in the Art Deco style in 1931 and is still the 15th tallest building in the world at twelve hundred and fifty feet it was open to dramatic fashion when President Hoover pushed a button in the Oval Office in Washington and turned the

where everything seems possible New York is known as the city that never sleeps a saying taken from a film of 1924 even the traffic contributes to the lighting effect along the streets like long multi-coloured glowing ribbons buildings are lit with neon hoardings and some of the skyscrapers are lit like works of art none more so than the Chrysler Building for many people this is the greatest Art Deco building in the city and was completed in 1930 at night the distinctive v-shaped lights which were fitted when the skyscraper was being built have become an iconic sight the flood lighting was added later seen from the river the city resembles a magical ocean liner set against a black sky to dazzle entertain and amaze create walls of glass sparkle in the night as the skyscrapers reflect the light from the streets of the city that never sleeps and out in the harbor the Statue of Liberty watches over the city a light shining out for the freedom she represents a perfect place to end
