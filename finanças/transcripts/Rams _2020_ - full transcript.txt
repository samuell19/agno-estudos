(Gentle uplifting music) (Sheep bleat) (Inhales and exhales deeply) (Engine rumbles) (Engine stops) Well, look at you, my beauties. Come on, girls. Oh, there you go. You are beautiful, you are beautiful... ..But you're the best. Yeah, there you are. (Grunts) Come on. (Dog barks in distance) (Whines and barks) (Quiet bleat) (Dog barks) (Quiet bleating) (Bleating continues) (Dog barks) What is it, kip? What's up, mate? (Bleating) (Lamb bleats) (Bleats) (Door creaks) (Hooves clatter) (Door creaks) (Atmospheric country music) (Bleats) In you get, kip. Come on. Hup! Alright, come on. (Starts engine) Hey, floss, come on! Come on, girl. Come on, come on. Good dog. (Yips) (Chuckles) Come on, kip. Come on. -Come on. -(Engine starts) (Car door thuds) (Music swells) (Hooves clatter) (People laugh and chatter) (Man calls out indistinctly) (Bleats) (Carnival music plays) Good boy. Hey. How are you, col? You right? Yeah, good. -(Men speak indistinctly) -(Sheep bleat) (Indistinct conversations continue) (Sheep bleating) (Exhales) How's my man? Oh! Now we're into the good gear. -Lionel. -Colin. You mind if I just have a little...? -No. -Thank you. -Man: G'day, col. -(Lionel wolf-whistles) Matt. Ooh! Hey. Wow. (Chuckles) How do you do it, mate? Man: Hiya, frenchie. (Sighs) He's gonna be a busy boy, I reckon. What do you mean? (Stammers) See all these blokes all dressed up, walking 'round like they run the shop? (Whispers) Merino farmers. They got millions of merino mummies looking for the absolute best... ..Daddies, kalgan horns, So they can have millions of adorable, little, delicious babies. Girl: We can have merinos on our farm! Nah, nah, we're not merino. Merinos are... Well, if you're gonna farm sheep... All: Farm a real sheep. Lionel: You see, maddie, you have to understand, merinos are like beer. Kalgan horns are like champagne. You never struck me as the champagne type, Lionel. I dunno. Rum and coke, then. Frenchie: Kalgan horns are more like a craft beer, you know, smaller vats, select ingredients. I'm trialling organic hops this year, actually. Oh, you can feed it to your llamas. Alpacas. They're alpacas. Hmph. Righto. Lionel: Yeah, it's a fine ram, alright. Be a close call, I reckon. Hey, hey, hey! Hands off, mate. (Sheep bleat) Woman: Jackson. All those breeders registered? Er, yeah, yeah. All here. Um, actually, I haven't got, er... Oh! I'll register les for you, shall I? Yeah, no worries. Thanks, mum! (Women chattering) (Speakers pop) Jackson: One, two, two. Ok! This is the one we've all been waiting for, folks - the kalgan horn ram judging, the Tom stocks memorial cup. -That's my old man. -(Applause) Uh, yeah. Judging today is the new district vet Kat O'Connell, who is from dorset in the UK, which is home to the kalgan's ancestor sheep, the dorset horn. Oh, and sal too. She's, er... She's the apprentice. So... yeah, anyway, er... Hang on a tick. Oh, hey, steady on, frenchie! (Laughter) Kalgan horn were first bred by the grimurson family in the plantagenet region in 1924, thriving in the wet winters and particularly able to survive through the hot, dry summers. Kat: Come on up. It is So Well-suited to our unique microclimate that it is bred nowhere else in the southern hemisphere. First-cross lambs from kalgan horn are market-ready or can be joined with a short-wool... Great. (Jackson continues indistinctly) -Oh, you're gorgeous. -What's that? I was talking to my sheep. (Clears throat) I'd like to see a little less square in the nose. I mean, it's acceptable but... Pretty good for a llama, but. With the muzzle, it needs to be like a mandarin rind. You want it rough and a little bit loose. Don't we all? Yeah, nothing. All good. Sorry. -(Whispers) Not appropriate. -(Chuckles) (Bleats) -Jackson: Oh! -(Crowd groans) Unlu...unlucky, mum. -(Scattered applause) -Oh, Well. -(Pats) -(Chuckles) See ya, frenchie. Jackson: Ooh, there goes frenchie. -What? No! -No! Down to the final three, folks. Wouldn't we all love to take the champion ram home today and put him over one of our ewes, eh? Well, you need to pay for the privilege and the winning breeder will make sure of that. Ah! Bad luck, Lionel. No surprises here, ladies and gents. The grimurson brothers find themselves the last two standing yet again. You get one of their lads over your ewes, they'll be pinging lambs back at you left, right and centre, no worries. (Laughter) The muscling in this hindquarter, it's... ..Unsurpassed. A lot of meat on that carcass. Great carcass, mate. Good job. (People murmur) Ok. (Cheering and applause) Jackson: And les grimurson is the winner! ('Before too long' by Paul Kelly) You little ripper! -(Metal clatters) -Jackson: I'll get it. There you go. Yeah, no worries. (Clicks tongue) (Grumbles lowly) G'day, can I just get a pot of this and a summer breeze, a pink one, please? Thank you. Thanks very much. (Women chatter lowly) -(Women continue chattering) -Here we go. (Whispers) Angela, Sally, at the bar. -Oh, hey. -I saw you at the show. -Yeah. -Boyd. -Oh, yeah. Sally. -Lovely to meet you, Sally. -Yeah, you too. -You local? Fergo: Oh-ho! That's rough. He's a real heartbreaker, your boy. Chip off the old block, eh? (Clears throat) I meant you, not stocksy. Not that he wasn't... You know, I was... It's fine. Don't worry about it. -Oh, come on, col. Cheer up. -What? You're a shoe-in next year, mate, I reckon. Frenchie: It's just that hindquarter muscle, mate. That was the only difference. I reckon he knows that, mate. Yeah, I Know he knows that. I'm just tryin'... Righto. -Righto. -Lionel: Righto. -Hey. -What have you got there, mate? Oh, I just, er... they're... I...i just drink 'em sometimes, So... Fergo: "I just drink 'em sometimes." (Laughter) -Stop it! -Just leave him alone. -What? -Cheers, darlin'. Hey, Jacko, I drink 'em too, mate. -(Laughs) -Angela: Leave him alone! (Soft music) (Sheep bleat) (Colin grumbles) So what's the story with this hindquarter muscle, then, eh? Hmm? Come on. Let's have a look at you. Come on, mate. Yep. (Ram bleats) What is this? (Stammers) (Bleats) Ohh! Oh, g... (Breathes deeply) -(Gate rattles) -(Grunts) (Whispers) Mate, we gotta go. Come on. Good boy. Come on. Yeah, we gotta get outta here. (Water runs) We gotta get this off you. Whoa. Oh, whoa. No, mate, wait. It's ok. It's alright. -(Door creaks) -(Music plays on headphones) Hey, mr grimurson. It's sal. -Sally. -Huh? Gary and Susan's oldest. She in? Good morning! I was just thinking about you. Were you? You're a welcome distraction from faecal samples. Uh... (Grunts) Ah, here. Um, thank you, Colin, for this. Uh, you're right. The writing's not gonna set the world on fire, but that stuff about your family, the grimurson family, that's, er...Quite a saga. What's up? Les's ram. I think it has ojd. Johne's disease? No, Colin. I Don't think you need to worry about that. He has all the symptoms. Um, listen, do you want anything, a tea or a juice or...? No. No, thanks. Kat: As far as I Know, you've never, ever had ojd in this part of the world. (Coffee machine whirrs) And don't forget, I had a good look at that ram. Colin: But you were judging. You...you were looking for different things. Would you like me to have another look? I could talk to les. Would you? You two haven't spoken in 40 years. Why start now? If it is ojd, what are the chances that both our flocks are infected? I Don't think it is ojd. Right. Ta. Les: What a load of crap. Who gave you that idea? Alright, So we get the results within 48 hours. -(Sheep bleats) -You don't need 48 hours. I can tell you now it's bullshit. Kat: Just doing my job, les. Les: It's bullshit, isn't it, mate? She wouldn't know what she's on about. (Clicks tongue) Kat: We'll take good care of him. (Bleats) (Tense music) (Thunder rumbles) (Kip whines) Come on, kip. (Thunder crashes and rolls) (Kip whines) Come on, mate. You're alright. (Continues whining) (Thunder rumbles) Alright, mate, there we go. -There you go. Yep. -(Gunshot) Cop that, ya sneaky bastard! -Ojd?! -(Gunshot) -(Grunts fearfully) -Les: Bullshit, it's ojd! You're a sore loser, you miserable prick! -(Whimpers) -Oi! Col! (Gunshot) Les: You're as weak as piss! Weak as piss. Eh, col, get out here! (Slurs) You want 'em to kill my ram. Ya think you can do that? Murderer! Come out here, you weak prick. (Kip whines) (Thunder rumbles) Shot your boot! (Chuckles) Shot your boot. (Grunts softly) (Thunder rumbles) (Rain patters) Yeah... (Mumbles indistinctly) -(Gunshot) -Oh! Bugger, shit, damn, poop, cack, robb's jetty. Bugger, shit, damn, poop, cack, robb's jetty. Bugger, shit, damn, poop, cack, robb's jetty. (Exhales) (Gentle piano music) (Birdsong) (Bone thuds) (Gentle music continues) (Sighs) (Engine rumbles) -Lionel. -Eh. -Brang the young fella along. -Hey. So what's this about? Oh, you know, just a bit of, um, target practice last night. (Lionel chuckles) -Lionel: So are you sure? -Colin: What? Lionel: Les's ram, are you sure it's ojd? No, i'm... look. I'm not an expert. Kat's the expert. Don't whip it around. Just hold it steady. Shit, if we got ojd in the valley... You lot on the east side, you don't have to worry. Mate, that creature's already been joined up with half me ewes, same as Bob's. (Music plays faintly on radio) ('One way street' by Bob gallion plays) (Song continues on radio) ? Every sign reads misery for me ? down this one-way street ? no detour signs ? for me ? loneliness... ? kip, come on! Kip! Come on, dog. ? No end in sight... ? go to les. (Les grunts) (Thudding) (Les sighs) Les: What have you got there, floss? -(Kip grumbles) -Come on. Bullshit. (Sighs) You were right. It's ojd. Yeah, I'm So sorry, Colin. I should have, um... The department. I'm So sorry. I've only just found out about this myself. They, um...They need access to the farm. Newsreader on radio: Plantagenet sheep farmers have been shocked by the discovery of a highly infectious disease on a stud farm near mount barker. Ovine johne's disease, or ojd, is caused by bacteria attacking the lining of the gut. The disease has been present in other parts of the country, but until now there hasn't been an outbreak in western Australia. Affected sheep can no longer absorb nutrients and ultimately starve to death. Ojd has the potential to be especially devastating in the mount barker region, with its unique heritage breeds and higher rainfall. The department of agriculture's infectious diseases team has travelled to the plantagenet region to carry out further testing in the hope of containing the outbreak. An emergency bio-control plan has been put in place for the entire valley and local farmers have been ordered to slaughter their sheep. It's a cruel blow for a community still recovering from a fatal bushfire two years ago which took the life of top breeder Tom stocks. (Sighs) Col. (Clears throat) So what do we do now, you know? -Like, I mean do we... -There's no fighting it. That's it, mate. Done deal. Yeah, I Know, but they found, like, what? Only 20-odd head infected on two farms? I mean, mine were clear. Yeah, it's the contact between farms. It's...it's... Well... ..They don't muck around with this stuff. They're taking the whole bloody valley. That's it. Les: Why don't they take us while they're at it? -Finish the job. -Frenchie: Look, let's not... I think we need to trust the department. Oh, the bloody department! Yeah, I mean, them? (Chuckles bitterly) That pommy vet, she's bloody useless. They don't know, do they? They just...They just come down here and... (Spoon clatters) Jackson, be a darl? It's overkill, obviously. Fergo: Well, they don't care, do they? Easier to wipe out our whole valley than risk it finding its way to their precious merinos. Even then, you'd think there'd be a bit of leeway for such a rare breed. I mean, the entire breeding stock. They're not pandas, mate. -I'm not saying that... -It's overkill. But the decision's been made. We can't fight bureaucracy. Les: Bullshit. They can decide all they want. They're not taking my sheep. You don't have a choice, les. They're gonna come and take 'em. Oh, you go on and do whatever you want, the lot of you. Yeah, go on! Obey orders from bloody bureaucrats. But not me. Not my flock. (Softly) No, no. No. (Solemn music) Here, Jacko. (Music continues) (Exhales) (Engine rumbles and stops) (Car door thuds) Uh, Colin, this is Brian de vries. Yeah, I Know. From the department. -What are you up to? -Hey? -What are you working on? -Oh. You know, I was just fixing a board on my deck there and I saw some dry rot in a stump. Next thing you know, you're drawing up plans and this and that. De vries: Full Reno, eh? Been there. -Good timing. -What? I mean, you know, you got plenty of time now. You know, now... Well, you won't have any sheep to... Sorry. Colin, we need to run you through the decontamination process. Yeah, right. All this old wool, obviously, um... ..Rags and, um, bits of old hessian sacks, they'll have to be burned. You'll be fully reimbursed, though, of course, for everything. Oh! Things like this, old tools. Um... The worst of the porous wood, that'll have to go. You can hold onto all this. Kettle. Kettle should be fine. Actually, the whole place is in pretty good Nick. Steel cladding - just needs a good clean. Bad luck for you. (Chuckles) Eh? Oh, we do new for old, So... Like next door here, your brother's shed. It's an absolute wreck. -(Door thuds) -Old and rotten. Whole thing's gotta go, get replaced. Brand-new shed. He'll be laughing. (Chuckles) Hey, retro. (Camera clicks) Colin: Grandfather built this shed. Him and his brother, 90-odd years ago, from timber they milled themselves, from trees they felled when they cleared the land here. Yeah, you had to in those days. (Chuckles) I reckon we spent half our lives in here. Bit easier now though, eh? You know, there's a bloke in town... (Clears throat) You know what his job is? He installs sheds. Yeah. He doesn't build you a shed. He installs a shed, prefabricated from... ..A factory somewhere. China probably. Hmm. I'll get you his number, eh? (Colin mutters) Dickhead. Anyway, the transport should be here Friday, fingers crossed. Been an absolute nightmare trying to find stock trucks. No-one wants to touch these sheep. The department is setting up a facility to...deal with them humanely. -A facility? -De vries: Oh, yeah, yeah. Don't get me started. That's a whole 'nother headache. I tried to tell Perth. Finding someone to process these sheep, I mean, they have no idea, no idea. They were raised here. I raised them. They will rest on this land. Kat: Colin, you know there's counselling. (Huffs) Failing that, I'm always up for a cuppa. A cup of wine, preferably. I wish... No, it's fine. It's fine. It's ok. (Softly) Ok. You know, these people... It means everything to them. (Grunts) No reception! (Chuckles) You just forget what it's like out here, don't you? Yeah, you do. (Starts engine) -Hup! -(Hooves clatter) -(Sheep bleat) -Hup! (Colin claps) Hup! Hup! Get up there. (Melancholy piano music) (Sighs) Music continues) You're beautiful... ..And you're beautiful... ..And you're beautiful. (Melancholy music continues) (Music darkens) (Trigger clicks) (Gunshot) (Birds squawk) (Gunshot) (Breathes shakily) (Trembles) (Sobs) (Moans) (Melancholy piano music) (Engines rumble in distance) (Hooves clatter) -(Les shouts) No! -Man: Les! Les: Mate, no. Man: Come on, les. -Les: I Don't give a toss! -De vries: Les... Les: I Don't give a toss what your piece of paper said. -De vries: Can we get some... -Man: Alright, alright. -Man 2: Come on, les. -De vries: We talked about this. Les: Take your truck and piss off! No, don't, don't! Let...Let go of me. -Les: Don't, you bastards! -Man: It's alright. Les: Let go of me! -Alright, can we just... -Please! -We've talked about this. -Please, I'm begging you. Please, don't take 'em, mate. They're mine! They're mine! No! (Les sobs) No! (Bolt clunks) Les: They're mine! (Sorrowful music) (Thuds truck) (Sheep bleat) I hope boxing doesn't run in the family. -Yeah, go! -(Sheep bleat) (Flies buzz) Oh, Colin. (Exhales) Colin, I... Oh, no, that's not... no! You can't do that. That's not on, that's not on. Over here, see this? What do we, er... what do we... Can we... we've got a situation here! You have to do what they say. Then in two years... (Flies buzz) (Fire crackles) (Sorrowful music continues) -Col. -Lionel. You right? Yeah. You just seen him? Yeah, he asked me who my mob was. -Righto. -Righto. So the good news is that all the sheep that you... That were slaughtered, uh, are covered. And you'll see here, this is what we call product loss compensation. So that's based on your average income over the last three years. Just in case you're wondering, though, it's only a two-year deal. We're not gonna pay you to do nothing forever. (Dr vries chuckles) Um, and So if you comply with the soil-testing schedule, then after two years you can apply to restock. But, er... Mm, yeah, absolutely no more funny buggers. Ok? You gotta follow the rules, basically. Um, ok, any questions? Feedback? Feedback? Questions? Where do I sign? Oh, I just have to run you through all your other options. The buyback scheme is actually quite generous. -I'm not selling up. -Well, ok, but I do... -I am legally obliged to... -I won't sell my land. I think you'll find that if you have a look at the rate of compensation being offered, it... Oh, no! Wow! Ok, great. That's good. That's your autograph down the bottom. Great. Oh, oh, there is actually one other thing. I was wondering if you could help us communicate with les. -Les grimurson. -House next to mine. Yes, Well, I mean, he's not really communicating with us. Well, you're brothers, aren't you? Yeah. No, we haven't spoken either for... ..Quite a while now. Right, Well, he needs to start decontaminating the shed, the... Everything, actually. I mean, if he doesn't start burning soon, then it'll be summer. You see, in summer, it's a total fire ban around here. No kidding. Soon. Well, not soon. Now actually. Asap. Otherwise, it's six months until the end of summer. So if he doesn't start, he'll hold everybody back. In six months, you, everybody will be held back. And So you need... Well, we need to communicate that to him. Thank you! ('Black coffee' by humble pie plays) ?

Sleep off the booze now. Colin: Yeah. Yeah. Alright, um...Um... (Colin grunts) Um... -(Kat clears throat) -Colin: So... ..Thanks for popping by. (Muffled thudding) Oh...bloody pipes again. You wouldn't believe the plumbing in this place. So, um...How about that cuppa? (Insects chirping) Kat: Has he been this bad before? Colin: Oh, a long time ago. But, yeah, oh, yeah. He had a bit of a... ..Bit of a rough trot there for a while. Things weren't easy for him. Anyway, you don't want to hear me rabbiting on. Sorry. I hope you don't think I'm prying. No. No dramas. (Mimics Australian accent) "No dramas." Oh, I used to love how Australians said that. It's probably why I've travelled halfway across the globe. "No dramas." (Kat yawns) Well... Colin: So why did you come across... Kat: Sorry. Don't feel you have to... I Know I sounded mysterious. It wasn't intentional. I hate it when people do that. Yeah, but I...I... I want to know about... ..You and stuff. (Soft music) (Sighs) You've never... (Exhales) Have any women ever made it out here? Yeah, one or two, but, um... ..He'd scare them away. Plus the bag of rotten prawns at the bottom of the stairs. That never helped much either. (Both chuckle) (Colin snickers) (Sighs and mutters) (Thudding) (Thudding continues) -(Sheep bleats) -(Thudding continues) ('Hark! The herald angels sing' plays on radio) ? Peace on earth and mercy mild ? god and sinners reconciled... ? -(door opens) -(Footsteps approach) (Grunts) (Groans) -(Grunting) -(Loud thud) ? Of the skies ? with angelic host proclaim ?

(sheep bleats) Dj on radio: That was slim dusty with 'Christmas on the station'. A bit of an obvious choice today. But in this heat, you might want to give that second serving of Christmas pudding a miss. (Exhales) (Birdsong) Oh, good! You're good. Alright, mate. Yeah. Oh. What a night, eh? A bit of drama, bit of romance. (Chuckles softly) Eh? -(Colin chuckles) -May: Ok, pull. -Hey! -(Laughter and applause) -Girl: What did you win? -It's a... Oh. -It's a sheep. -(May whispers) Yay. -Angela: Hi, Sally. -Hey. -You're working here as Well? -Nah, just here. The timing's a little bit off for becoming a vet nurse. Turns out you need animals for that. -Angela: Oh, I'm sorry. -What? Did Kat lay you off? No, no, no. It's not her fault. Actually, she's got something lined up for me in Perth next year. Perth? How long for? Er, like, for long or are... Fergo: No, you won't be back. Once you're used to all the nightclubs, you'll be breaking hearts all over the place, won't ya? Ok, Well, I'll be back in a tick to take your order. Alright. Um, actually... ..We're, um... We're moving on too. -Lionel: Hey? -What? May: I mean, for us, it's take this offer now or hand over to the banks later on. We don't really see it as a choice, with all the debt. -Where you going? -Katanning, for now. -Seasonal stuff. -Lionel: Katanning? You're working with merinos? We gotta do something, sitting around for two years with no sheep. And that's if ojd doesn't come back. -No, that's not gonna happen. -Fergo: Who says? The pommy vet? That ag department bloke? He wouldn't know his arse from his farrr... ..Canal. Alright, girls, why don't you go outside and play on the bouncy castle? Grrr! -(Girls giggle) -(May clears throat) They had ojd in tassie. Three times they slaughtered in 10 years. I mean, maybe this is the kick up the bum some of us need, you know? It's not like it's raining cash with heritage breeds. But that's exactly why we need to think outside the box. -You know, diversify. -You and bloody llamas. Alpacas, mate. They're alpacas. You know that. They're the only things that made me a profit this year. -Righto. Settle down. -I'm staying, for now at least. Been offered a job. -Oh, yeah? -Yeah. Well, the ag department mob cleared out and... But they still need people to test and that. What, you're working for them pricks? Mate, you're working with merinos. At least they're sheep, not bloody alpacas. -I mean llamas. -Oh, shut up! -Don't get all cut. -Frenchie: I'm done with you. You're always pushing and giving me grief just 'cause I'm giving it a go. -You're all cut, are you? -Yeah! At least I'm trying, mate. Look at you. What do you do? You give up! I mean, think of your kids. -You're bloody gutless! -Angela: Now, boys... -(All shout) -Angela: Stop it, boys. Boys! May: Fergo, sit down! Let's not do this. Let's just not. Sit down. We haven't made a decision yet. Let's just be honest. People are gonna leave. You can't blame 'em. And then what? No more footy team, no more fire crew. I mean, huh, no more fire crew! What are we gonna do next Christmas? If Lionel has to move away, then we'll be struggling to find a Santa claus. Oh, I Don't know about that. (All chuckle) (All snicker and laugh) (Gentle uplifting music) (Doorbell rings) Hmph! (Doorbell rings) (Sighs) (Doorbell rings) (Doorbell rings) -(Scanner beeps) -(Muzak plays) Oh, just the man I'm looking for. Ha! Ok. Er, that's $81.60. -Thank you. -Merry Christmas. Yep. (Clears throat) You're a hard man to get hold of. -Oh, yeah? -Yeah. I tried calling, tried popping in, a couple of times. Oh, yeah? Righto. (Clears throat) I was, um... Oh, I'll be back. Oh, actually, do you mind, um, the goats cheese, just pop it in the fridge? Just, yeah... wait. Yeah, just until I... Come back. -Uh, like I was... oh, sorry. -(Brakes squeak) Like I was saying, mr grimurson, I need to talk to you. -Were ya? -Sorry? I Don't remember you saying that. It's this business with your brother. I'm sure you know he hasn't really been cooperative. And it's a bit of a worry, to be honest. A real worry. He's the only one who hasn't cleaned, hasn't burned a thing, and he's gonna set the whole valley back. Well, you know this. Anyway, the thing is I checked the papers and as far as we can see, les doesn't own his land. (Engine idles) It's entirely in your name. (Switches off engine) Would you care to... You know, what's that about, then? Dad left the farm to me, only me. But before mum died, I promised her that... ..Les could live in the old house. So... Well, how did he end up with half the bloody... Right. Ok, I've tried to be... ..You know, about the whole thing, but this means that you're responsible for him. If he doesn't want to follow the rules, it's you that's... When I fill the forms out, it won't be his name on there. It'll be yours is what I mean. -Yeah, mate, I got it. -Ok. You wanna keep the farm? Talk to your brother. (Sombre music) (Sighs) Where you gone, kip? Kip, kip? (Softly) Oh, yeah. Good dog. Come here. Take this to les, can you? Take it to les. Go on. Les. Oh, shit. Wait. Wait! Kip! Ahh! -Here you are, girls. -(Sheep bleat) You're gonna love this. Les: Oi! (Slurs) Oi! Col! (Thumps at door) Les: Oi! What's all this crap? Hey? What do you think, you can tell me what to do? Eh? Eh? That's not how it works, little brother. -(Rattles door) -(Grunts) (Rattling continues) (Crashing) (Lock clicks) Open the door or I'll kick it in! You think I'm gonna listen to you? You think I'm gonna listen to you, ya weak prick? (Grunts) You know what you can do with your letter? You can wipe your arse with your bloody letter! You weak prick. It's not yours. It's mine! It's mine! (Exhales) Daddy's little boy. Ya prick. He was always a weak prick. (Coughs, clears throat) (Engine revs) -(Kip barks) -(Engine stops) (Barks) (Yelps) (Gentle music) (Engine revs) (Tray thuds) (Gentle music continues) (Metal creaks) (Gasps softly) (Birds caw) (Gentle music) Hmm. (Timber creaks and clatters) (Creaks) (Clatters) (Clattering continues) Oh! (Grunts) (Metal squeaks) Er, mr grimurson? Ahh! Mr grimurson! Sorry, I just, er... Mum said to tell you that he's got alcohol withdrawal, that he'll be in there another week maybe. You know, I can give you a hand. Not with the... With the shed. I mean, you know, the clean-up. Not the... god. (Chuckles nervously) A week, you say? Nah, I'll be right. I can do it. Yeah, yeah. Hey, um... You're not leavin', right? Taking an offer? What do you reckon? Um...no? Yeah, I...I don't wanna leave either. But everyone else is moving to Perth. Oh, not just Perth. I mean, people are moving everywhere. Some people are going to Perth, not all, just... People who want to be vet nurses. (Chuckles nervously) Yeah, anyway, I just, er... ..I just wish things were normal again. Look, um... (Sighs) That support beam in there, maybe it is a two-man job. Yeah. All good. I'll see you tomorrow, then? Yeah. Um...up here, not down at my place. Yeah, all good. (Gentle music) Woman: There you go, nice cup of tea. Newsreader: ..Bushfires which are threatening homes on the outskirts of Albany. Dozens of residents have been ordered to evacuate and authorities have transported 100 tourists visiting the local attraction, whale world, to safety. Conditions are expected... G'day. Hey, mate. (Uplifting music) Three, two, one. (Timber clatters) Newsreader: Firefighters in the great southern have been stretched to the absolute limit, battling as many as 50 blazes across the region. The biggest, near Albany, prompted emergency warnings overnight, with lives and property under threat. That fire remains out of control and is moving quickly in a northerly direction, threatening homes and lives in the shire of plantagenet. Career firefighters are currently battling the Blaze and local brigades are on standby... (Timber clatters) Hey, col. Colin: Yep. (Door creaks) (Melancholy music) Newsreader: The weather outlook has been described as extremely dangerous, with a total... (Switches off TV) (Rattling outside in distance) (Squelch) (Grunts) Ohh... (Engine rumbles outside) -Ta, love. -Woman: Yep. See you, les. (Engine rumbles in distance) (Quiet music) (Handle clunks) (Colin exhales heavily) (Mutters) (Murmurs indistinctly) Colin: Alright, girls. (Colin speaks indistinctly inside) -(Clattering) -(Colin muttering) I reckon you might have a couple on the go there. And how about you, my love? Oh, yeah, you too, eh? (Metal squeaks) Colin: Mate, I'm proud of you. All the girls are up the duff. It's a good job. Well done. And now that's it for you, ok? Put it away. -(Liquid gushes) -Oh...! (Low tense music) (Radio beeping) -(Sighs) -(Beeping continues) Angela on radio: All fire-fighting units in the kalgan river area are called to woogenellup road north. I repeat, all firefighting... Newsreader on radio: Fires swept through farming land close to Albany while at lower kalgan, a house and four chalets have been destroyed. With So many fires burning and wind gusts reaching 80 kilometres... See ya, girls. You be good now. Newsreader: ..Seems certain to get worse. One such fire is heading towards mount barker... Ok, mate, you gotta make this last. I might be a while. Newsreader: ..Mobilised in an effort to save the town. The biggest threat to residents and firefighters is smoke inhalation. And if you're in this area, you too are in danger. Do not attempt to evacuate as it's now too late and the roads in the plantagenet region are no longer safe. (Crew shouts indistinctly) Angela: The back-burn here's been great. Good work. Now, the wind's not a huge problem right now, but you know what it's like. It can crank up, get gusty. Jackson, mate, you gotta prime that back-up tank. Right, col, just keep goin' on this flank. -Thanks. -Colin: Right. Alright, you two, I Know it's tempting, but don't go too deep along this section. We've got 10, maybe 15 minutes, right? Buddy up, stay hydrated. -Did you catch that? -Nup. Albany crew's caught on the old road. We're not gonna stop this one. But with our back-burn here along this wedge, we might be able to stop it getting to town, maybe. Ok. You good? -Yeah, I'm good. -Alright, good. Man: Come on. I'm down to 416 on Marion, 416 on Marion. Chuck it in the side, spin it 'round. (Dramatic music) (Fire crackles) It's madness him being here. When did he get back? I'm not sure. Maybe...Maybe this morning. I Don't know. Angela: Well, keep an eye on him, eh? Silly bugger. It's gonna get worse before it gets better. (Dramatic music continues) Angela on radio: All units, fall back and stay vigilant for spot fires. I repeat, all units, fall back, stay vigilant for spot fires. (Coughs and spits) Angela on radio: Fire front approaching! All units, fall back! (Engine revs) (Coughs and splutters) (Coughs) (Colin gasps and chokes) (Fire crackles) I Know what you got in your house. They're mine! You stay away. -(Grunts) -(Thuds) Stay away! (Indistinct chatter over radio) When did he get here? Jackson: I dunno. I only saw him, like, a couple hours in. (Coughs) Righto, everyone, I just spoke to regional. They're still at it up the coast, but with the wind change, it doesn't look like it'll flare up this end again. Everyone, pack it in. Let's see you back here tomorrow for mop-up. Well done. (Coughs) Righto. Hey, col, I reckon you should just take it easy. No, no, I'm good. Thanks, mate. (Engine starts) (Starts engine) Think he's alright? Old fellas like that... The way he's looking, sniff a bit of burnt toast tomorrow morning and, bang, gone. You reckon? Nah, mate. Just sayin'. (Both chuckle) (Fire crackles) -(Door thuds) -(Sheep bleat) (Coughs) Oh, good, good... -(Coughs) -(Thudding in distance) (Rattling) Angela on radio: All kalgan river firefighting units report to woogenellup road north for mop-up. Repeat, all kalgan river firefighting units report to woogenellup road north for mop-up. (Sighs) All kalgan river firefighting units report to woogenellup road north for mop-up. Repeat, all kalgan river firefighting units report to woogenellup road north for mop-up. Over. (Doorbell rings) Oh, for the love of god. (Coughs) Kat, I can't chat. I'm sorry, i'm...I'm... -Yeah, heard about yesterday. -(Col coughs) How are you faring? Yeah, nah, i'm, er... (Coughs) I'm fine. Thought So. Thought I'd pop over anyway. -Yeah. -Hey. I reckon you could do with one. Oh, no, no, no. I'm right. Thanks. (Sighs) Oh, Colin, give yourself a break after what you went through yesterday. Oh, for Christ's sake, Kat! I just...I just don't want you checking up on me all the bloody time. (Sighs) (Slams door) You selfish old bastard. You are sick of me checking up on you all the time, are you? Asking how you are, if you're ok? Well, I'm just fine, I'm bloody fine, in case you were wondering. I'm...I'm tickety-boo. You know, no dramas here. Why would there be? God, I'm an idiot. What is wrong with me? I wanted someone to talk to and who do I turn to? A mute. You can't even talk to your own brother and he's right there. He's just there. Oh, god, what did I... You're a sad old man and all you can think about is your dead bloody sheep. And it's not even... You're not ever, ever gonna change. I wanted to! I didn't wanna be this... ..Sad... (Gasps) Kat: That's one hell of a fire, isn't it? Colin: Yeah. You know, my grandfather spent his first few summers up there. Just a few head of stock. Pretty tough country. That's why they reckon our bloodline's So strong. (Laughs drily) That's the sheep, obviously. Kat: Oh, I Don't know. You're doing alright... For an old fella. The thing is he went up there with his sheep because there'd been a fire through there not long before. Big fire, all along the Ridge, down to the beach on the other side. He knew that after a fire, green shoots everywhere, the bush is never lost. Is this still the same fire, the smoke? Yeah, the wind's changed. Oh, bloody wallabies. They'll overrun the place. (Chuckles and coughs) Colin... (Colin continues coughing) Better get a wriggle-on, eh? You kept some. In your house! Oh! Kat, what are you doing? No. You stay there. No. They're not infected. They're fine. -Kat, please, please, please. -(Engine starts) I had to. I Know you did. I Know you did. (Sombre music) (Mutters under breath) (Knock at door) (Sheep bleat) (Sheep bleat) ('Bad to the bone' ringtone plays) (Chainsaws buzz) (Ringtone continues) Yeah, I'm on call today. Fire and shit. You what?! (Quirky music) (Trapdoor thuds) (Bucket clunks) (Colin grunts) (Exhales, mutters indistinctly) (Quirky music rises) Hey. (Car horn blares) (Beeps horn repeatedly) (Horn blares and beeps repeatedly) (Metal clanks) Mr grimurson, I've been authorised to inspect your property. Just have a look through this approval form... He gets it! (Engine starts) (Bleats) Is it true? Man: No sheep. A lot of air freshener, though. Did you notice that? What's all that about, huh, all the air freshener? Where are they, Colin? Nup, nothin'. You smell all that air freshener? That's not a coincidence. Search the property, every last inch. -You didn't know about this? -Excuse me? You and him, you're...Friendly. No, I did not know about this. Well, either way, he's done it now. Violation of the terms. He'll lose this place. He thinks he can hide it with some air freshener like no-one would notice? First thing I noticed. Did you really have to? I mean, the whole valley? -Every last one? -Yes! This is the way, I mean... I'm not the bad guy. Ojd, that's the bad guy. We're the... And him, he's... He's the bad guy. We're trying... We need to get rid of this disease and he's just... I think I've been pretty... And everyone's just... We find those sheep, he is done! (Phone clicking) (Sheep bleats) (Sheep bleats) (Bleating) (Radio squeaks) I think I might have an interesting development over here. Over. I said I think I might have an interesting develop... (Heavy thud) (Gasps softly) (Grunting) (Grunts) Man on radio: Vehicle 1 to control. It's Wilson here. You trying to reach me, boss? Boss, you there? It's Wilson. -(Kip barks in distance) -Lionel: Mad bastard. Hang on. Is that...? -He's with... -Les? Bloody hell! (Chuckles) (Kip barks, sheep bleat) Kat: Still burning up there. It's dangerous, isn't it? Yeah. (Kip barks) (Engine rumbles) You getting the boss on the radio? Can't get him. Your boss, not mine. (Clears throat) Yeah, nah. Maybe he's back at the house, eh? (Uplifting music) Huh! Mad bastards. (Both laugh) (Kip barks) (Colin shouts indistinctly) (Engine revs) Colin: Get up. Get up, kip! -(Kip barks) -Get up, kip. Hup, hup! Hup, hup. Hup-hup! -Colin: Whey! -Les: Come on! Come on! -(Kip barks) -(Sheep bleat) Colin: Hup, hup, hup! -(Bleats) -(Colin shouts indistinctly) Get behind! Hup! (Les exhales and groans) (Sheep bleat) (Exhales) Ah. (Sheep bleat) (Sheep bleat) I suppose you've been joined with these ladies already, eh? -(Chuckles) -(Sheep bleat) Huh... ooh, yeah. Oh, you're a fine ram. A fine ram. -Righto, kip. -(Barks) Let's get a wriggle-on. -Get up! -(Kip barks) Get up! Up-hup-hup. (Kip barks) -(Sheep bleat) -(Kip barks) Get up, get up! Get back, kip. -Les: Whoop! Whoop! -Colin: Hey-up! (Kip barks) -(Kip continues barking) -(Sheep bleat) (Engine revs) Colin: Good dog. Get up, kip. -Get up, kip. -(Kip barks) (Wind whips) (Coughs) Here! (Shouts) What do you reckon? The wind's changed. Head to the beach. (Wind whips and whistles) Colin: Get up, kip. Hup, hup, hup, hup-hup. (Wind whistles) (Hooves drum) (Engine revs) (Slow intense music) (Kip barks) (Kip barks) (Engine rumbles) (Kip barks) (Sheep bleat) Colin: Hold, kip. Hold, kip. -(Sheep bleat) -Good dog. (Water lapping) (Engine falters) (Metallic clank) -(Grunts) -(Tyres screech) Les: Bugger me! See if we can lift it. (Engine strains and revs) -One more. -(Engine strains) Les: It's stuck! (Engine revs) Colin: Well, shit. -(Kip barks) -Kip! Kip, get around, get around! Bring 'em back. Kip, kip. Come on, bring 'em back! Bring 'em down, kip. Bring 'em down. Les! -(Engine revs) -Colin: Les! (Engine idles) Col?! (Switches off engine) Col? Oh, shit. (Fire crackling) Col! (Wind whistles) Col! (Eerie music) Col! (Coughs) (Continues coughing) (Coughs) (Gentle music) Col? Col, come on, mate. Col? It's les. (Tearfully) It's les, mate. (Les grunts) (Grunts and mutters) Arggh! (Groans) (Groans) Ohh! (Strains) Oh. (Panting) Come on, mate. One more. (Groans) (Grunts) (Continues grunting and groaning) (Gentle music continues) You're right, mate. You're right. I gotcha. Ah... (Tearfully) Everything's gonna be ok. You'll see. You'll be right. You'll be right, mate. (Sobs) Everything's gonna be ok. Oh, mate. Everything's gonna be ok. (Waves crash, wind blows) (Rhythmic thudding) (Post clatters) Jackson: Thank you. Kat: Yeah, these are all looking great... ..For merinos. Well, they mightn't look like much now, but with 100-odd years of breeding... ..They'll still be rubbish bloody merinos. -(Laughs) -Colin: Oh, you never know. One day, a long-lost flock of kalgan horns might just come... Wandering out of the bush. You never know. You never know. -Yeah, I reckon. -Definitely. Yeah. -(Whistles) -(Sheep bleat) (Thermos clatters) (Chuckles) Yep. (Lush instrumental music) Colin: Oh, yeah. Oh, that's a good boy. Yep. Oh, you're beautiful. (Softly) Beautiful.
