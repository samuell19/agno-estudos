Be right back. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday, dear Mommy ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ I love you, Daddy. I love you too, baby. It's late, I gotta get up early, so, I'm gonna to bed. - Daddy. - What's up? Did you see the Morgans' house is up for sale? Do me a favor and just, um, stay away from that house. Is it because somebody died in there? Can we just talk about this another time? Okay. So, why are you here, Hayden? Why now after all this time? Sometimes I find myself doing things that I don't want to do. I have these thoughts, these desires. I try to quiet them, I try and suppress them, but I can't. What kind of thoughts exactly? Horrible ones. So, what do you think caused the change in you? So many things. One night I saw this documentary on Satanic cults, and I was captivated. I don't know why, but from that moment on, I researched everything that I could about the religion. I read every night. I learned all that I could. I became obsessed. I couldn't stop even if I wanted to. And then one day, all my anger unleashed. All my hate, all my fury. In that moment, the feeling was exhilarating. The need was fed. That feeling soon passed, the need vanished. And all that was left inside me was fear and resentment. But what I didn't know is that the need would leave the door to my soul open. For years, I've watched dark thoughts play at my mind's doorsteps. And as the darkness walked inside of an open door, an evil so pure came out. I never did find her. A few weeks later, I got a gig as a video assistant to help record a seance. But everything went haywire. - Hello. - Mrs. Watkins, I've assembled my team and I'm on my way to you right now. No, no, please don't. Things have been fine for the last few days. My husband doesn't want anyone coming over here. He made that perfectly clear. Mrs. Watkins. Your daughter is in serious danger. I found evidence that the land your house is on used to be used in Satanic ceremonies. Ever been to one of these? Yes. Is this shit for real? - Yes. - I have my doubts. How did you get this gig? I work in video production at the school. Why? It's gonna take more than a video production class to handle what you're about to see. You need to tell your husband, and we need to do this tonight Otherwise, I fear that the demon is gonna make an attempt on your daughter. Please, just trust me, Mrs. Watkins. Hello? Okay. I'll be right there. Evil's very powerful. It'll play tricks on you. Whatever you see, whatever you think you see, don't let go of each other's hands. What if we do? You lose your soul to the other side. - And? - And you'll bring darkness upon this realm. So, we do as I say, or put everybody else at risk. - Yes. - You understand? Yeah. - Yes. - Of course. Oh, my God, I am heartily sorry for having offended Thee tonight, confess to all my sins because I dread the loss of Heaven and the pains of hell. But most of all because I have offended Thee, my Lord, who is all good and deserving of all my love, I firmly resolve with the help of Thy grace, to confess my sins, to do penance and to amend my life. Amen. Lord, may the living water of your heart purify us. May you surround us and guide us with your loving light. In the name of Christ, I command you to come forward. It's here. I sense it. In the name of Jesus, I command all authority and I bind all the powers... ...and forces of the earth and the air and nature and fire. Lord, who is seated in the center of the universe. - I praise you for your creation... - Stop! Stop! Stop, stop, stop. - In your name, I defy... - Make it stop! We can't, it's already begun. Surround us... and our families. and you shield them in the protection of your precious blood that was shed for us on the cross. Amy. Mary, mother of God, we seek your protection and intercession and protect us and our families. Mary, mother of God, surround us in the shelter of your living love. Break us from our enemy. Save Michael and our guardian angel. Come! Defend us. For art Thou who can destroy the evil that roams the earth. - Help me. - In the name of God, Almighty... Stop this shit right now! ...the demonic forces to be parted at once from us, - from our land, from our house, in the name of God. - Amy. In the name of Jesus, in the name of the Holy Spirit. Amen. - Stay away from me! Paul! - In the name of God Almighty... Do something! In the name of God Almighty, I bind and command you to depart at once! Away from us! Away from our hearts, away from our lands in the name of God, in the name of the Father in the name of the Holy Spirit. What the fuck? Amy! - Father Michael! - Get another priest! This has never happened before! Let's get the fuck outta here. No, no. Oh, my God, no! Not my little girl. No. It's your fault! - No. - It was you! This is gonna end right now. No! No! - It was you! - No, no, please. It was you! Her husband went crazy and shot all of us. Then all I remember are flashes. Do you hear my voice? I need you to stay with me. Just listen to my voice. I need you to stay with me. You brought this into my house! It was you! Please! - You did this! - No. No! Don't! I woke up and found myself in a motel room. I was covered in blood. Who did this to you? Was it me? I don't know how I got there or who she was. I did this to you? The darkness that entered my soul also had a need. A need I haven't figured out how to control. I gave it a taste because I couldn't kill on my own. It killed for me. That's the first night I blacked out. The first time it took over. I went out looking to kill and awoke in a river of blood and tears. I feel it within me. Breathing, moving, laughing, feeding off my fears. I don't know which way is up anymore. But all I know is that I've fallen to the point of no return. Hello. Hi, Daddy. Hi, honey, what's wrong? I didn't want to tell you because I know you're going to lecture me. Okay, well, I'll try not to lecture you then. Tell me, what happened? I don't know. It's been a really weird day. Why? What happened? Earlier this morning I was getting coffee, and I'm at this rest stop and this weirdo spills his coffee all over the ground. At first I thought, you know, he just burnt his tongue or something. And then he turns to me and says, - Don't drink that. - "Don't drink that. It's full of maggots." Were there maggots? No, he was crazy. And then, just now, this car pulls up behind me with its high beams on. Literally forces me out of its way, and it had a whole other lane to go around me. So, I moved a little to the lane, and then it just started messing with me and staying side by side with me. And I literally had to slam on my brakes for it to get going. Did you see who it was? No, they had black tints. You see, this is exactly why I didn't want you to take this trip alone. Come on, Daddy. I'm really freaked out about the whole thing and you're not helping. Do you mind just staying on the phone with me for a little while? Yes, of course. And don't tell Mom. Last thing I need is for her to worry. I won't. I felt awful leaving today. Come on. We both know what kind of opportunity that this is for you. She wouldn't have it any other way. I know. Oh, my God. What happened? I just ran over something lying in the middle of the road. I think that it popped my tires. I'm calling roadside assistance. Stay on the phone with me. Oh, my God. What is going on? Tell me exactly where you are. Um... I'm on Route 10. I'm about ten miles away from Lake City. You made it that far already. Didn't I ask you to stay the speed limit? Daddy. Daddy, there's somebody behind me. Can you see who it is? No, I can't see, their brights are on. Wait, Dad, somebody's coming. Wait, Daddy. Daddy, it's the guy from the rest stop. Do you know him? No, Daddy. He's from the rest stop. Honey, I'm calling the cops right now. Do not open that door. Daddy. Daddy, please help. Holly... Holly, the cops are coming, baby. ...goddammit. Holly? Holly, the cops are on their way! Holly! Megan, Megan, Megan. It's okay. It's okay, I'm here. I got you. It felt so real. No, it was just a dream. It was just a dream, all right? I'm sorry. I'm okay. - I'm okay. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Sure? Good, 'cause I'm not. You gave me about three heart attacks You're learning the secrets of wizardry at school? It's just a book I found. Oh, God. Nightmares. It's not that bad. This book is too dark for you. Let's just put it back where you found it. That's not funny, Daddy. It wasn't meant to be. This book is too dark for me. - You shouldn't b reading this, get rid of this. - No! It's late. You're tired. Get some rest. What're you gonna do with it? Good night, sweetie. Megan! Megan, are you okay? Daddy? Did you even sleep? I don't know. Time to get ready. Holly, the cops are on their way! Holly! Where did you get this? Found it. Found it where? Someone threw it out. So, I picked it up. Still don't know why you won't let me read it. Are you kidding me? Did you hear the scream you let out last night? It was a nightmare, Dad. Yeah, I wonder why. I'm almost 15. Stop treating me like a little girl. You're my little girl, and I'm just looking out for you. Hello, finish your breakfast. I'm gonna be late for school. Hey, girl. Hey, babe. What's up? Hey, how you doing? Doing all right. How you doing? I'm all right. A little tired is all. So, what's up tonight? Anything lined up or what? Yeah, you know we got that guy from before coming through. That's good. I hope it's better than last night. Oh, can I get one of those? - Oh, yeah. Hmm. - Thanks. So, what happened? Girl, you'll never believe it, and it's just my luck. Last night, I was at Lou's Bar and I ran into one of my old clients. Alone, Celine? Yes, I know, but I knew him from way back then, - and I thought it was set. - There's a fucking psycho out here. So, what happened? So we're in the room, and everything is cool until he pulls out this razor. And I'm like, "What the fuck is that for?" And this psycho told me he wanted me to initial his name on his penis. I can't do this shit anymore. I can't, I can't do this shit anymore. Every time one of them walks in the door, we gotta wonder if it's just another John trying to get off, or some fucking psycho, sadistic asshole who wants to live out his fantasy. And every time I see another one of those girls on the news, it's like I'm living vicariously through her and then Ala's face pops in my head. And I play out this whole scenario where the cops have to come to my house, tell my little girl that her mommy's not coming back. And I see her face, Celine. She's devastated. That little girl loves me so much. You know, she's the only reason I was able to overcome my past, and I'm gonna make damn sure that I'm there to provide for her. Hello. I'm good. Oh, okay. Well, can you give me, like, 30 minutes? I just need to freshen up. In our top stories tonight, two missing call girls. ...seem to be the killer's number one target, and their circle of freedom has gone smaller. Please, if this is you on the street, stay alert and stay together. Relax, honey. We're alone. Hey, are you okay? Oh, God. Please, please don't hurt me. I have a little girl. Please. Oh, God. Jackie? What the hell? You put these lights off? Ain't like we gotta pay for lights, you know. Oh, God. Hayden. Hayden. Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! - What is it? - There's somebody in the house! - Where? - In the living room. - Are you sure? - Yes, call the cops! - Wait right here. - No, stay here and call the cops! Megan! Wait right here. There's no one there. You're probably having nightmares again. No, Daddy, I swear I saw someone in the living room. All the doors and the windows are locked. There's no one in the house. No, Daddy, I swear I turned on the lights and there was a man standing there. Megan, I promise you, there's no one there. Come on. Come on. So, you went through the trash to pull out the book? No, Daddy, I swear the book was right there when I came home. I don't want to hear another word. I'm disappointed in you. Dad, I swear, it was right there. I told you I had to be up early for work. Please, go to bed. - Hi. - I need to see Dr. Harris. Do you have an appointment? No, but it's very important I speak with her. I'm a former patient of hers. If you get her, she'll tell you. Okay. What's your name? - Hayden Kroll. - Okay, hold on. Dr. Harris?
