A WOMAN MINISTRY OF THE INTERIOR Juliane, I'm going to bed. - Are you still working? - Yes. I'll be up soon. What are you doing? I'm looking at you. I love you. Come here. Hold me. Good morning, Mrs. Verbeke. Good morning. How are you? Fine, thanks. So, what do we do about the cedar? Have you decided? Like I said, I'm out of ideas. Hugo's in Chantilly for the day. I'll talk to him tonight, okay? Thank you. - It's been a while. - Yes. I thought you'd quit. No. I train in the forest. I was afraid to come back here, to be honest. Yes, I understand. I'm happy to see you. Did you go by the cemetery? There were flowers. Yes, her favorites. I came because I need your help, Fabienne. I'm writing a book about Lydia and I'd like you to tell me about her. So it won't be a crime novel this time? No, not at all. She was my little sister, but you knew her better than I did. I don't think anyone really knew Lydia, you know? She didn't open up easily. Remember when she first ran away? Yes, I remember. She was already like that at 12. Unstable... I don't even know how I managed to bring her here. But in the end, when she left for Japan, like that... That was different, wasn't it? I don't know, Juliane. She seemed so unhappy. This might be the time to write under your maiden name? You shouldn't have dropped it. Crachet may be a strange name, but it's yours. And Lydia's. I'm not sure my publisher would approve. Find another publisher, then. Your fans will be surprised, that's for sure. If I finish writing it. Speaking as a doctor and a concerned citizen, what's happening here is worrying. People rarely wear masks now, protective measures are ignored... There's an undeniable slackening. Yes, Sami. Garnier was found in the woods near Porte Dauphine. Alright. I'm coming. We can't rule out that a more aggressive variant could emerge. Garnier was your colleague, right? Yes. What did he get mixed up in? I don't know. Ma'am? We have a witness. The Captain will take care of it. Some cops think they're untouchable. Dealing with scum has a price. Still, to end up killed, like a dog... That was his choice. He was still a man. A man, but a bastard. Why are you looking at me like that? Have you always been like this? I guess so. We've located a suspect. Can you handle it? I have to see the Prefect. Aren't you coming back? Call me if anything comes up. Garnier made a bad choice, so you don't care. What about all the good years? I do care. Call his family. We can see them, if they want. How's that? Don't forget to call back Copeau, please. Sure, I'll just have him call Chief Verbeke. Yes, Hugo. Hi. How are you, darling? Good. Where are you? On the road. Heading back to Paris. Did you go to Chantilly? Yes, as planned. The visits took longer than expected and I had a few things to take care of. I saw some magnificent apartments. Look, I have to go back to the agency. I forgot some files, so don't wait up. I'll be home late. Okay. Love you, darling. Love you, too. I was beginning to think I would leave without a kiss. Are you okay? I had trouble sleeping. Is it your book? I went to see Fabienne to talk about Lydia, but it didn't help. I no longer know what I'm writing. You knew it would be difficult. Don't give up. Did you go to the cemetery? You should've waited. I'd have gone with you. I went yesterday. It was exactly five years. Yes, I know. I went into the garden last night, to smoke. And I could see her tending the flowers. She loved doing that when she was here. She was better at it than you. I should've been better with her. I didn't help her. I could've done something. It's not your fault, you know that. It was an accident. Isn't it beautiful? The owner's left the country. He wants to get rid of it quickly. I'm going tomorrow. Perhaps we could rent it for a break, before it gets sold? Sure. Why not? Let's talk when I get back. I'll be gone two nights. I'll visit other houses while I'm there. Juliane. Agathe and I will make dinner tonight. Sure. She's just staying one night, right? Yes. She'd rather be in Paris, at the apartment. To see her friends. I'm not sure it's tidy. We haven't been in a while. I'll take care of it. I'll call ahead. Is there something you want to tell me? We have to decide if we're cutting down the cedar or not. I've asked around and there's another treatment we can try. The garden wouldn't be the same without it. How about a kiss? - Are you really a hunter? - I am, yes. I started doing archery, like Juliane, when I was young. Later, I met people who did bow hunting and they got me into that. Bow hunting? That's a thing? Yes, absolutely. It's a different approach to hunting. How so? You camouflage yourself. You become one with nature. You hunt down the animals by becoming like them. But the ultimate thing, and Juliane knows this through target archery, is when you release the arrow. Something incredible occurs. I remember looking into the eyes of a stag right before shooting. He was a handsome, powerful beast. I shot a single arrow and he collapsed. The smell of blood filled the air. And then it was incredible. I felt a deep communion. I was both the animal and the arrow. I felt myself dying with him. While being at the origin of it all. You're back at the source. It's an inner journey. Time travel. You should try it, Juliane. It's Copeau. If you like, you can come with me. We have to wait for the hunting season... You wanted to talk to me? Your transfer's been confirmed. You should leave as soon as possible. You must be glad. You got what you wanted. No, I was hoping you'd be convicted. I only did my duty. Our duty is to protect, not beat people up. I know what I have to do. Do you know what you're facing? I'm talking to you! He refuses to talk. One thing's for sure, he didn't kill Garnier alone. Shall we? Go ahead. You're not coming? No. Keep me posted. I forgot to lock the door yesterday. These stairs are exhausting. Hold on. You okay? Yeah. You? We need to tidy up a bit. My daughter's coming for a few days. Let me shower first. Constance, we have get going. I don't want to be late. I love having sex with you. Me too. You love women. It shows. You must've had many. Have you had many men? No... You and I are alike. That's the good thing about us. We're upfront with each other. And we keep it casual. Do you still love Juliane? Deeply. I couldn't bear to hurt her. She's everything I'm not. She has a pure heart. If it makes you feel better, I prefer wild hearts. Everything's good to go tomorrow. If the house isn't comfortable, I know a nice hotel. Are we taking your car or mine? Mine. Isn't your wife suspicious? No, she's too busy. And your husband? He's taking care of his sick mother. He's nice with me and the kids. But if I ever fall in love again... Who knows? I was out walking in Hyde Park, after a class. It was nice out and I was happy. I was talking on the phone to Ã‰milie, the redhead you met last time. Anyway, I was walking and talking to her. I was sure I was over him. I had forgotten about him. But then, bam. I saw him right in front of me, kissing a girl under a tree. I thought I was going to faint. Then I pulled myself together, moved closer. But it wasn't even him. It's driving me nuts. I broke up with him, but I see him everywhere in London. With girls, by himself, all the time. Is he really worth it? He's a total scumbag. At least he's not in Paris. You'll be okay there. What would you do if I cheated on you? Me? I'd have to kill you, my darling. I thought here was the Temple of Law. That's your mom's domain. I'm just a poor human. An incredibly weak one. What's the sentence for a crime of passion? If it's premeditated and there's no extenuating circumstances, the maximum. I'd still like to kill Steven. Before any bloody acts of vengeance, let's have some pie. Dad said it's been hard for you with the anniversary. I have nightmares about it, you know? I see that driver. Lydia under the car. She smiles. Then I wake up. I miss her. It's crazy. You have nothing to feel guilty about. She was so passionate and fragile. You did a great job protecting her. I feel better knowing Dad's here to help you. He's good at that, right? Yes. After what happened with Steven, I thought a lot about you two. Really? Why? It's crazy how much you still love each other after so long. I find it encouraging. - Still working? - Yes. Juliane, are you okay? Yes, I'm fine. I'm going to bed. Agathe is already asleep. I'll drop her off at the apartment tomorrow on my way to Normandy. Great. You looked so much alike. Does your book mention her drawings? Yes. I can't wait to read it. I'm sure it'll be beautiful. See you in a bit. Lydia. Lydia? Lydia. Wait! We left, didn't want to wake you! Love, Agathe & Hugo Sami. What's going on? I've left you messages. I'm sick, I'm not coming in. Are you okay? What's wrong? Just nausea. I'll be fine. Anything new with Santis? He's still tight-lipped. We need to keep him in custody. Fine. I'll see him tomorrow. Hugo, love can't flourish in the dark, it stagnates... Let's find a place where light will shine on us. I love you, Lydia I'm lonely, I miss you. Hugo, I'm scared, I'm trembling and crumbling. You left two days ago... How can this suffering end? Hugo, I can't go on like this. I can't let you go. You're my everything. My heart will explode. I don't want to live anymore. PROPERTY DETAILS In the Arctic, we know there are huge quantities of oil and gas under the melting ice. Drilling could release old viruses. We know climate change is already... Does it hurt? Dry your hands. Ma'am. I'm sorry, but... Could you help us out? Let me see... No, this isn't about money. There's a man outside. My husband. He just hit our little girl. Don't you have a phone? Shall I call the police? - No, not the police. - Why not? I'll get in trouble. What do you want, then? Do you have a car? Yes. Take us with you. Somewhere near. Wherever you want. Just so he won't find us. Please help us. Where is he? In front of the store. Look, he's right there. Do you see him? Next to the white car. Look, I can't do what you're asking. - But ma'am... - Call the police, they can help you. I'm begging you. Don't leave us. He'll end up killing us both. He's a scumbag. - I can't go back. - I'm sorry. - I just can't. - I'm sorry. Just do it. Let me talk to him, goddammit. I don't care that he's busy. I don't fucking know. Get in. Quick. Hurry up. Get down! Don't worry, I'll take you to a hotel. I don't have any money. I'll take care of it. Just promise me you'll get help at a social center tomorrow. We'll drive a while. You should rest. It's Dad! He found us! No, that's not him. That's not him. It's okay. What's your name? SolÃ¨ne. That's pretty. Do you have kids? Yes, I have a daughter. She's 25. Do you love her? Yes, of course. Come on. It think it's this way. Put your mask on. If you need anything, don't hesitate. We close in half an hour. This way. Here's your room. The light is on the right. Thank you, ma'am. Good night. Here you go. You'll be safe here. Thank you. I'll leave you, then. Could you... Could you give us some money? We don't have anything. It's all in his car. Here. Thank you so much. Bye, SolÃ¨ne. Go take a shower, and then to bed. Okay? Can you stay a little? I've a long drive ahead. I have to go. - Until I go to bed. - Stop bugging her, SolÃ¨ne. She's done enough. Just a few minutes. I'll be quick. I tried running away many times. But he always ends up finding us. I don't know how. Then he makes me pay for it. It's horrible. He takes it out on her, too. He doesn't just hit her either. I mean, I suspect as much. She doesn't say anything. She adores him. You need to go to the police and tell them everything. He'll go to jail. But when he gets out, he'll kill us. I know all about cops. I don't like them. And they don't like me either. They won't believe me. They won't care. I'll get in trouble. They'll take my daughter away. I know how it is. No, I don't want to. SolÃ¨ne, are you almost done? Yes, it feels really good. Hurry up. The lady wants to go. Juliane. Mrs. Juliane has to leave. She's waiting for you. I'm Virginia. What about him? - Nils. - What does he do? Wheeling and dealing. He won't say what. Go to bed, quick. Mrs. Juliane has to go. Everything will be okay now. Do you believe me? I guess I won't see you again. Can you talk a bit? My daughter was the same, at your age. She liked to talk before sleeping. Every night, we'd make a promise to each other for the next day. Can you promise me something? Yes. If someone hurts you, you need to fight back. Okay. And help your mom when she needs it. Yes. Thanks again for your help. Good luck. Juliane, answer me, I'm worried about you, I love you. Don't push me! Don't touch her. We're leaving. Put your jacket on. Hurry up. Come on! Open up. Quickly! It's okay, ma'am. Go back to your room. Open now! What's going on? Why are you shouting? I want to see Virginia. Let me in. She's fine. The girl, too. I'll take it from here. Can I come in? Didn't you hear? Many thanks, but you can go now. Virginia, it's me. Can we talk? He followed us. He always finds us. I told you. Don't come in. He's dangerous. Shut the hell up! Are you okay? What the hell are you doing? This is none of your business. Get lost! - Careful, he has a knife. - Freeze. You didn't tell me she was a cop. Hand me your knife. I don't have one. Get back, hands in the air. You must be joking. Do as I say. Back up, turn around, hands against the wall. What now? Ma'am, leave him alone. Everything's okay. We're leaving. Didn't you hear? We don't need you. Turn around! This is illegal. Give me your name and badge number. I know how it works. What's your name? Why won't you tell me? Stop it. Listen carefully. Get down. Nils, stop! You're gonna let us leave. You hear? Nils, stop! Don't hurt my dad! Stop! Stop it, Nils! Having trouble breathing, huh? Stop it! - Let go or I'll shoot. - With what? With what? You lost your gun. Stop it! I don't see her gun, Nils. Let her go. Shut up, you stupid bitch! That's enough, goddammit! What have you done? Please... We need to go. Sure. I'll take you to the hospital. No. Take the keys and drive. I'm taking the keys. Come on, let's go. Get out, SolÃ¨ne. Wait for us outside. Get out, quick! You're not leaving. Wait for the emergency services. What now? You're gonna shoot me again? Wait here, I said. What have we done to you? Who do you think you are? Who are you? You're nothing. You're nothing. You wanna shoot? Go ahead and shoot. Go on, shoot! You killed him. Why did you do that? Why did you kill him? Why did you kill him? Why did you do that? Why? Why? You bitch! Why did you do that? Why? You bitch! Don't come in. Bitch! Stay there, SolÃ¨ne! Don't touch her! No, don't do it. Let us go. You understand nothing. You know nothing, you scum. Don't do that. I can help you. Don't move! Stay there. Come on. Let's go, SolÃ¨ne. Stay. Hurry up! Let them go. I'm with the police. Are you hurt? No. We called the police. Wait for me, I'll be right there. The Conduct officer is coming. Can I wait in a room? I'm tired. Wait here. It won't be long. Where were you when he took out his knife? Near the door. He came forward. He wanted to kill me. So I shot him. How many shots did you fire? Two. Why two? I panicked. Did he die on impact? Yes. What about the mother and daughter? They hit me and took my weapon. They threatened me, before running away. I couldn't stop them, I was barely conscious. Do you know the victim's name? We couldn't find his ID. I know his first name. Nils. What about them? No, they didn't tell me. Why did they turn against you? You were helping them. They were shocked by his death. But wasn't he abusive? Yes. They were in his grip and they feared him. The mother also told me she was avoiding the police. Are you okay? Do you feel unwell? I'm exhausted. I'd like to rest. Alright. We'll stop for now. The Prosecutor allows you to sleep here. We won't take you into custody. But you're expected at the station at 10 a.m. tomorrow. For your official statement. Fine. You can tell me more about what you'll be doing in Normandy, for your book. I find the writing process fascinating. I say this, because I've read and loved all your books. They're accurate. They don't lie. Try and get some rest. What's this I hear about a murder at a hotel? What are you doing there? Your husband tried to reach me. What should I tell him? No news regarding Santis. Call me! Santis confessed all. Where are you? Call me back. My darling, I was worried to death. Where are you? Why didn't you answer me? The police called, they're looking for you. What's going on? I know who you're with. And what you're doing. Her name's Constance. You went to that nice house in Normandy to fuck her. And I also know about Lydia. It's your fault she's dead. What are you talking about? I read her letters that you keep in the shed. You broke it off. She couldn't bear it. She fled to Tokyo and killed herself. She even warned you. In her letters. But she didn't. It was an accident. No. She wanted to die. She jumped in front of the car. No. There were witnesses. You read the police report. It's wrong. No, you are. Look, I'm coming back tomorrow and we can talk about it. There's nothing to talk about. You're just a scumbag. I've been betrayed like no one ever before. I never loved anyone but you. Juliane, you know it. You sullied that love and you killed my sister. You toyed with her and you killed her. I didn't toy with her. Or kill her. I left her, because it couldn't go on. It was impossible. She was desperate, she fled to Tokyo and I couldn't stop her! No one could've helped her. You know how she was. You shouldn't have toyed with her. Listen to me. I was devastated by her death. Devastated. And I still am, you have to believe me. Looks like you found solace. I saw you fucking at the apartment. Your women... How many have you had these last five years? And before Lydia, how many were there? Juliane... You don't even apologize? Juliane, let's meet. Let's talk, please. You'll understand. Hugo? What's wrong? Should we pack up and head to Paris? Yes. It's her. Who? Juliane! Get down. Get down, Hugo! Call the police. Call the police! Shit. Constance. It's okay. Juliane, stop! Come on out! She's crazy, Hugo. She wants to kill us. Come out! I'll go talk to her. Call for help. Jump! Don't leave me, Hugo. I told you to jump. Hugo! Juliane, stop this. Let's talk. Juliane? Juliane. You need to stop. Stop! Stop. Juliane, that's enough. Stop it, my darling. No. - You're going to kill me, huh? - Apologize. For Lydia, for me. For our daughter, who believes her father is such a good man. Apologize for everything! Juliane, I love you. Nothing else in this world matters more to me. I was never unfaithful in my heart. Never. I wanted to tell you about Lydia. I couldn't pretend anymore. But I couldn't. I was hoping you'd find out. All these letters. I couldn't pretend anymore. I wanted it to end. Why did you cheat on me? I don't know. I don't know. I needed to... Your love is too... too big. It's too big... for me. Forgive me. Forgive me. My love, have pity. I'm sorry. There he is! Hello, ma'am. Police. Are you okay? Go ahead, we'll meet you by the car. Wait. Last night, I killed a man in a hotel. I pretended he had attacked me. He was violent, but I didn't have to. I killed him voluntarily. Last night, I tried to kill my husband and his mistress. I did it knowingly and with premeditation. I'm guilty of murder and attempted murder. I'm Chief of Police in Paris. My name is Juliane Verbeke. Verbeke is my husband's name. My real name is Crachet. It's a strange name, but it's mine. I'm Juliane Crachet.
