Get the fuck away from me! Jenny, just hold on second let me explain. Stay away from me! You're a little confused. You're filming this? I just want to talk to you. You're being overdramatic. You don't need that! I'm not gonna hurt you. You know me, remember? You know my heart. I would never hurt you. Lilly, what'cha drinking? I'm sorry, was that for me? Yeah. What you drinking? Oh, it's, um, just tea. Ooh, do you put honey in it? Honey and some lemon? That's really good. Especially for the "kckk" throat. Uh, no, I haven't. I haven't tried that. Try yerba mate. It's really good. Someone just told me that green tea is, like, better for you than water. Caffeine releases slower over time, but I have to have coffee. I hear boba's nice. - Oh, yeah. - I don't like boba. Yeah. I wish you lived closer. It's not that far. Feels like it. I know. It sucks. It really does. You sure you're okay, hon? I worry about you. I don't want to cry. Then don't. You know what I mean. I know. Honestly, I... don't really feel like anything's getting any better. Have you thought anymore about seeing a therapist again? No. I'm not going back to that guy. He's a mansplaining prick. I don't think he was listening half the time. Well, maybe there's someone else that's-- No. I said no. Okay. What if you started vlogging again? Hear me out! It is not a terrible idea. Yes, it is. It's stupid and it's a waste of time. No, it is not. Everyone needs an outlet to get their shit out otherwise it-- it festers and it ties you up in knots, and it makes you sick. And, besides, your videos were always so funny and so sincere, and you're such a good writer, I just... what if you just tried one and saw how it felt? Nobody ever watched my dumb videos. I did. And they're not dumb! I don't know. Who came up with the word Vlog anyway? It's, like, so gross. It's like the sound you make when a barf gets stuck in your throat. It's like... Ew! Gross! Wait, but what if, hold on. If it's a barf and a gag mixed together wouldn't that be called a barg? Or a garf? Could be a garf. Gar-- oh! My cookies. Hold on a second. It's cool, just call me later. Okay. Love you! -Love you! -Garf! Hi, guys! Happy Tuesday! For this Tips Tuesday, as requested in the comments, thank you guys, I am going to be doing a little tips about plant care. Uh, as you guys know, I am a crazy plant lady. If you haven't seen my place, uh, Tyler and I have so many plants, like, it's ridiculous. So, specifically today I want to talk about watering and making sure that you get the light-- Hi, guys! Happy Wednesday! Uh, I wanted to do something a little different today, so we were shooting outside. Please don't mind all the crazy noises, um, but I wanted to show you guys my happy place. This is my park. Um, well, that's the corner. That's the park, see? I park myself, like, right over there. I don't know if you can see, the dog park is right there. I situate myself and look out at the dog park as if I had a dog also playing in the park along with all the other people watching the dogs. And all the dogs run up and they want to play and they want to be pet and I get to, like, snuggle with them. And then people are like, "Oh, which one's yours?" I'm like, oh, the fluffy one over there. And no one ever knows. Oh, favorite quote... you guys ready for this? ...of the day. It reminds me of the dogs. Outside of a dog, a book is a man's best friend. Inside of a dog, it's too dark to read. Okay, that's really stupid. I get that, but I do. I love it. Oh, fuck. Hey, Lill! I just watched your vlog and I am so, so, so proud of you! It was amazing! I loved it! And there's all these comments and views and likes! And someone said they shared it on Reddit! It just seems like people are really connecting with what you have to say. -Shit. -I'm just so proud of you for getting it all out there! I just know this is going to be exactly what you need. - Move on, start over and just... Oh! Lilly you look so cute today. Oh, thanks. I showered. Nice! I showered today, too. Check it off the list. Soon as I get off this call. Lill! Come on! I'm sorry. I froze. I wasn't wearing any makeup And I was feeling bloated and gross and also just not in the mood to chat up a weird guy. You said he was cute. Well, yeah, but who just waves at strangers like that? You're right. I just finished the Night Stalker documentary, and Richard Ramirez was just known for walking around waving at strangers. It's a known serial killer thing. Really? No! It is perfectly acceptable to greet and/or show interest in another human being one finds attractive by smiling at them and yes, even waving. Very funny. Oh, gotta go. Date night. Talk to you tomorrow? -Okay. Bye. Talk tomorrow. -Bye. Love you! Morning everybody. -TGIF! -Yes. Hey. What? Hi. -Are you okay? -Oh, my God. I am so sorry. -No. No, no you don't-- -That was incredibly gross. I'm so sorry you had to witness that. You don't have to apologize. I'm the one that startled you. You did kinda sneak up on me there. What can I say, I'm light on my feet. Makes it easier to sneak up on my victims that way. You're all right? Yeah. I'm fine. I'm sufficiently embarrassed, but good. What's that you're choking on there? Um, just veggies and pesto. Veggies and hummus. Do you mind if I sit down and eat next to you? Sure. Yeah. I mean, I'm just not staying super long 'cause I have to get back to work at some point so... Understood. I'm Tom. Lilly. Lilly. I love that name. What? I mean, it's fine. It's a pretty common name. No, I'm being genuine. I love it when girls have flower names, like Lilly or Rose. -Violet. -Petunia? Okay, maybe not that one quite so much. Sorry if I'm making this awkward. I'm just... I'm not sure if I remember how to do it correctly. -Do what? -You know. Talk to a cute girl I just met. My last relationship didn't exactly end well... and I haven't spent a whole ton of time around people lately so... Trust me, I-- I get that. -You're doing fine. -Yeah? Yeah. Scale outta 10? Um, like... like a 6.5? 65 percent? That's like a D. No, I said 6.5. -Yeah. It's the same thing -That's different. -I'm basically failing-- oh, my God. -Oh, my God! I'm so sorry! I'm sorry! Was that not suave? No, I'm crying. I can't. -I'm sorry. I just um-- -Here. Here. Okay. Thank you. Oh, my God. That is what I get for wearing makeup today. Shit. I think you look lovely. I'm sorry, this is all just a little surreal. Strange men don't throw sandwiches at you in the park every day? Oh, shit. I gotta go. Zoom meeting. -Oh. Yuck. -Tell me about it. My entire life is staring at assholes in small boxes on a screen all day. Not literal assholes. Like, the people I work with. They're-- they are assholes. Yeah. I got that. Sorry. I just really have to get going. Yeah. Of course. No worries -Missing something? -Yeah, your handkerchief -I was gonna wash it for you. -No, it's all good. Uh, I got it. Are you sure? It's kind of gross. Wait a second. Is this your sneaky way of getting to see me again? No. If that's what you're doing... No! I wasn't, I was... Okay, maybe that's what I was doing, but I wasn't aware that I was doing it. Must have been subconscious. I don't know. I'm at the park for lunch almost every day. So, yeah, you can do with that information whatever you want. The park it is. Okay. Bye. Oh, my God, my ears! I'm sorry! I'm just so excited! Okay, it's not a big deal. It is a big deal! It's a huge deal! You haven't so much as talked to another guy since Tyler. Oh, fuck. Sorry. No, it's okay. It's not like he's Voldemort. We should probably be able to talk about him or say his name or whatever at this point. Giving him any more power over me isn't going to help anything. So just, yeah. It's all good. Good. I'm okay. Yeah? Yeah. I don't want to fucking cry anymore. I'm sick of it. His name was Tyler and he was a fucking asshole. See? There. I'm fine. Oh, Jesus! Please don't start. I literally just said I don't want to cry and if you start then I'm gonna start, too. I'm sorry I'm just so proud of you. Thank you. Okay. Talk tomorrow. Love you. Love you. Bye. Have fun with Mark or whatever you're doing tonight Hey. -Hey. -Oh, shit! I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. It's okay. It's the most action I've had in a while. Kidding, of course. Although, not really. The same. So, what were you watching? You were so focused there. Nothing. Nothing, oh yeah. I've definitely seen that one. Yeah. I don't know, it's... it's kind of embarrassing. Oh, was it porn? Yeah, you got me. I was watching porn in the park before our date. Fine. It was a... a self-help video. That's nothing to be embarrassed about. I watch those, too. -Really? -Yeah. Who was it? I probably know them. Barry Wright. Yeah! My Emotions Belong to Me. She's my favorite. I watch all of her videos. -Some of the more than once. -Really? -I even have her book. Yeah! -No way. Me, too! That's awesome. It's just, you know, it's embarrassing to have to admit that. There's nothing wrong with trying to better yourself. I know. But... watching self-help videos isn't necessarily the most attractive... It's not the first thing that I want to reveal myself on a first date. I just said that I watched them too. Right. Shit. I am digging myself in deeper here. Um... Okay, how about I just start over again? Hi! I'm Tom. Sometimes, I watch self-help videos to help me deal with some tough things that I've been through in my life. And, I know that's nothing that I should be ashamed of because lots of people watch self-help videos. They can really be a mirror to kind of reflect everything that you've been going through. And it's good to hear someone else's perspective... You want to go for a walk? Lilly? Hmm? Uh, I was saying that it might be nice to go for a walk if you're up-- Yeah! Yeah! Yeah. Sure! I'd love that. Okay. Was that okay? I didn't mean to-- Yeah, no. It was great. Really. I'm good. I'm great. I'm good. You pulled back. It's just been a really long time since I've kissed anyone, or even wanted to kiss anyone and I just... feel... really happy right now, which is just kind of bizarre in its own way. And I just felt a little bit overwhelmed. That's all. You take all the time you need. I get it. Believe me. It's like Barry says, "You have to... hold on to your boundaries until you're comfortable breaking them down." And that shows trust. It took me a long time, too. My last relationship was a complete disaster, and afterwards I had to move and start my whole life over again. Ever since I barely interacted with anyone except for you and my computer. So, you really were watching porn in the park. I knew it. Yeah. You got me. I'd be willing to bet you that Aleister Crowley probably was a Gray. - He knew some shit... - -Way to go sandwich guy. Mark, can you turn that down, please? Respectful and supportive and a good kisser? Sounds good on paper. Tom. His name is Tom. T-O-M or T-H-O-M? I don't know. I think just regular. Good. I do not trust a Tom with a T-H. -Oh, yeah. Me neither. -Either way... to Thom. Ugh! I completely recoiled like his lips were covered in acid and he somehow took it like a champ. I was pleasantly surprised. You're hot. Guys put up with a lot when you're hot. I mean, I think it could possibly be that he's just actually a good guy. Perhaps. And he likes Barry Wright! Your YouTube lady? Yeah, I don't know. It was just so great to be around someone like that, that was, like, warm and caring and also speaks my language, which is a huge bonus. I mean, we haven't really gotten into all the details, but from what he said his last relationship was, like, totally fucked, too. And he had to completely start over and start, like, a whole new life. And so we talked about Barry and how much her books have helped us both deal with the guilt and shame of being powerless. And... I don't know. It's weird. It's kind of like we're the same person. He almost makes me feel... normal. Almost. Okay, you're not gonna like this, but I just feel like I have to say something because I love you. Um... while I'm all for you having some no-strings-attached fun with a guy which I have been saying for a while now. Um, do you really feel like this is the right guy to do it with? Just because two people with trauma who are still healing, just seems like it might get a little... A little what? Dangerous. I'm gonna fucking hang up on you. No, please, please don't. -I like him. -I know. And I'm really happy for you and he seems really nice. It's just... I'm worried you're being a little manic about this whole thing, and I just caution you to take things slow. Especially with a guy like this. Manic? Now you're calling me manic? 'Cause two seconds ago you said this was a good idea! What the fuck? Okay, that might have been the wrong choice of words. Don't get mad at me. I just-- Okay, remember at the hospital at our survivors' group? Dr. Collier specifically said that two people with emotional wounds who are still healing can create a trauma bond that feels intensely like love. Well, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, okay? I guess I'm a terrible person because I'm enjoying the fact that someone wants to kiss me and hold me and be supportive and be nice to me. What the fuck could I possibly be thinking? I am desperately lonely, Deb. Do you not get that? 'Cause I am by myself, like, all of the time, and you're always busy with your boyfriend and you do these things to try to protect me, but you don't actually understand what I'm going through and he does, okay? He gets it 'cause he's going through it, too. And maybe we could help each other heal. Did you ever think about that? Did that ever occur to you? Oh, no. I forgot. You're too busy pretending to be my therapist to actually know what the fuck you're talking about! Fuck. Don't put a silver lining on it. Don't try to fix it. Don't try to play optimist. All that they need to hear is a reflection that you see them. So what do I mean by that? For example, you can use phrases like, "Wow. I see how hard that was for you." Or, "I can see"-- Wow. I see how hard that was for you. Wow. I see how hard that was for you. "...how hard you're working to try and get past that." And the best phrase of all everybody needs to hear is, "You are not alone." You are not alone. You are not alone. You are not alone. So, I hope that through this video and in my new book, you will find all sorts of new ways to build trust and vulnerability and just remember: no matter how hard you try, how patient you are, how open and vulnerable you are with yourself, your partner may not open up to you on the timeline you expect, or with the depth that you expect. And it could get frustrating. But in those moments always come back to our mantra. My emotions belong to me. ...so we're gonna end a little early today. Does anyone have any last words before we sign off? Tom, you've been quiet today. Is there anything that you would like to share or comment or...? Um... no. I feel like I'm learning a lot and making progress just from listening. Thank you. Great! That is great! It is important that we all go at our own pace. Jenny, would you like to say anything else? Um... Yeah. I guess, um, I just want to thank you guys for being so supportive and just, like, express how grateful I am that I found this group. I, um... don't really trust myself in relationships right now, but I also need to be with people, so, I'm just really grateful that I'm, I'm here. So thanks. We're here for you Jenny. And I am grateful for all of you. See you all again next Wednesday. Bye. Yes! I swear it was the same guy. I wanted to scream at him. In the span of a day, he'd completely forgotten who I was and now all of a sudden was pretending to be a vet with cancer, which is just all kinds of despicable. -No way. -Yeah! - That's gross. - I know! So what did you do? I mean. Nothing. I just turned around and walked away and now I'm venting to you. Oh, I felt like such a wuss. I wish I would have punched him in the face. If it makes you feel any better, I probably wouldn't have done anything either. I would have just texted you venting about it. You know, we've got the same issues with confrontation. Oh, my God! Wait! That reminds me. I wanted to tell you. Um, I was doing more reading on RW Wayne, and he said something that really hit me. He said that being afraid of confrontation is essentially the same as being fearful of being rejected. When he said that I was, like, that is so accurate. Once again, it all comes back to the abandonment stuff, which is, like, such a part of my freaking DNA. Tom? Huh? Oh! Sorry, I was just thinking about what you said. You do that a lot. What? - Think? - Yes! It's like you're studying what I say sometimes. If that's weird, I can try and stop. Wait, no! That's-- no, please don't. Most men don't even listen to half the things you say. They're just thinking about boobs and football the rest of the time. You're different. It's one of the things I like about you so much. I feel like you actually listen. I do. And that you really care. I care about you. I care about you, too. Good. This is magical. I feel like I'm high or something. Yeah. You make me very happy. Same. It's amazing to have found someone that I can truly trust and completely let my guard down with. I know. No. I can't do this. What just happened? Did I do something wrong? Tom! Are you gonna tell me what the fuck is going on? Tom? Tom! What the fuck? Will you talk to me, please? I don't think we should see each other anymore. This was a mistake. What? I don't understand what's happening right now. Did I do something wrong? It was stupid of me to think I could be with someone like you. Someone like what? Someone like what? Broken. Fuck you! -I'm sorry! -No, you're not! -It's okay. -No, stop it! -I'm so confused. -It's okay. -It's okay. -What are you...? No! I don't-- I don't understand! What are you doing? Oh, my God! What are you doing? Stop it! Let me go! Get the fuck away from me! Jenny. Just hold on for a second. Let me explain. Stay away from me! Okay, before you hang up, just let me talk first. Fine. I'm sorry I didn't support you in the way that you needed and I love you. That's it. Thank you. I just worry about you and I want you to be safe. I know. And I admit this is moving a little fast, but it's taken a really long time for me to get here and I just... wish you could be happy for me. I am. But, like, for real happy for me. I am. He's coming over tonight. Oh, really? Mm-hmm. I'm cleaning now and then I'm gonna shower and shave. What's the plan? I don't know. I just think it's important for me to have a guy in my apartment who's not Tyler. I'm really proud of you. Thanks. I'm proud of me, too. I think if I can get through tonight without acting like a total freak at any point or crying that would be a major milestone. Okay, well keep me updated and touch base with me later. I will. I love you. Get the fuck away from me. Jenny! Just hold on for a second. Let me explain. Stay away from me. You're a little confused. You're filming this? Okay, just calm down. You're being overdramatic. You don't need that. I'm not gonna hurt you. I would never hurt you. You know me. You know my heart. Hi guys! Um... I haven't posted in a while. You probably noticed, um, I don't know if anyone's even gonna watch this, but my friend Deb... told me that it might be, uh, really healthy for me to release some stuff and, uh... I don't know. If I've learned one thing it's that Deb is always right. So... I don't know what the fuck I'm doing, but I'm here. So, hi. Um... some of you guys might remember, uh, me talking about my boyfriend on the blog before and... I guess I just want to, um, tell the truth. Because I told you guys that he was, um, kind and funny and and smart and that we loved each other unconditionally and, um, it's just really hard for me to go back and watch those because it's just really, really embarrassing. And everyone just keeps telling me that I'm, uh, you know, a survivor and I'm a warrior and I'm-- I'm so strong, but I just don't feel that way. And I'd like to think that maybe there'll be a time that I could feel that way, but right now I just... I just feel, like, really fucking embarrassed. And... You know, it's really easy if you've never been in an abusive relationship to judge someone else, you know? Like, I get that. Like, I get that from the outside it's so simple. Like, just leave. Why wouldn't you just leave? Why would you stay with someone that treats you like that? But... from the inside, it's... it's, like, warped, you know? Like, I somehow convinced myself that I wasn't a victim. I was a strong woman who just happened to fall in love with a really troubled man. And... it's really hard to admit how bad it got, um, but it got really bad. And, uh... the drinking got worse and the violence got worse. And I was just living in this constant state of dread. This dread that the next time I still wouldn't be able to stand up for myself 'cause that's what would happen. I would tell myself this isn't gonna happen again. You're gonna stand up for yourself. You're gonna do something. You're gonna leave. You're gonna walk away and then I just... freeze. This... thing would wash over me and I wouldn't... I don't know. I just... He could make me feel so weak. And I would just sit there and cry while he screamed at me. And I... I don't know why I let him do that. And then he would hit me with his fist or whatever he could find nearby and I would tell myself that somehow I deserved it. And it was my fault. I wanted him to die. I wanted him to die so bad because I knew that that's the only way I'd ever be rid of him. And I wished for it. I wished for it every single day. I sat there and I wished that he would die. And then he did. He died on the floor right in front of me. Right there. And I was... I was heartbroken. And I am so fucking ashamed to admit that, but I was heartbroken 'cause I loved him. Despite everything that he did to me, I still loved him and I... I'm just so confused. And I... I've spent every single day since just being consumed by the guilt and... So fucking confused. What is wrong with me? I'm sorry, I-- I wanted this to be, like, inspirational and happy and I'm sorry it's not. It's not. I don't have any answers. I'm just tired. I'm really fucking tired. -Thank you. -You're welcome. You like it? Yeah, it's good. Booze is pretty much all the same to me, but, yeah, I like this. I like you. What were we talking about? Yeah. Um... Oh, you were telling me about the movie you were watching when you were supposed to be working. Mmm, very, very important stuff. Um... I don't know. It was sci-fi. I heard it was good. It wasn't good. It's kind of the whole story. It's fascinating. Sci-fi is my favorite, -so I've probably seen it anyway. -Oh, yeah? Yeah. Especially if it has anything to do with androids. How come? I don't know. I haven't tried to talk about this with a human in a while. Usually doesn't go quite like I'd hoped. You can tell me. With everything I've been through, I promise I'm the last human who would ever judge you for anything you want to share with me. Okay. Um... I identify with the tragedy of their lives. All of that potential. All that beautiful engineering, but... their existence is ultimately hollow. Is that how you feel? Androids don't actually feel anything. They're just mimics. See, I knew you wouldn't understand. -No, I-- I-- -No. It's okay. It's my fault. I should have known someone like you wouldn't get it. Someone like me? We're the same-- -No, we're not. No. -Yes, we are. Just because you don't want to talk about it-- You think I don't want to talk about it? I wish I could talk about it with you and everybody else. But, I can't. You said you weren't going to judge me and I feel pretty judged right now. You're making me feel like I'm crazy or something. The look on your face. -I-- -It's like... someone just died right in front of you or something. Lilly? Lilly, are you okay? I'm fine. I just need a second. I'm sorry if I said anything that made you upset. -Can I come in? -I just need a second, please. You okay? Yeah. I'm-- I'm fine. It's just something you said. It was a major trigger for me and it's not your fault. You didn't know. I guess I'm just not as tough as I thought. It's not about being tough. All survivors have triggers. At least, now I know what happens when I hit yours. Can I have a hug? I'm sorry. I really have to pee. We can talk about it after, okay? Okay. Hey, Tom. Tom? What? Do you think you'll want another drink? I was thinking I could open us another bottle of wine or maybe a cocktail or something? Sure. Okay. Okay. -Mmm. -Yeah. Let's go again. Hey. Morning. So, how are you? Pretty good. You know, a little tired. What time did you get up? I'm not sure. I was kind of up all night. Sorry I kept you up too late. No, no, no, no. It's not your fault. I just don't always sleep super well. Kind of hard to turn the brain off sometimes, you know? Yeah. Apparently I did not have that problem last night. I must have passed out on you. Sorry. It's embarrassing. -So... -So... No, no you go first. I need to see you again as soon as possible. Would you want to go somewhere with me? Sure. I mean, go somewhere like a trip. Oh. Just for a couple of days. No big deal. Where were you thinking? I could tell you or... we could make it a surprise. Surprise sounds fun. Um, I guess just let me know if I need to bring anything special, otherwise I'm-- I'm good with that. Pick you up tomorrow morning? So soon? -Is that a problem? -No. No, no I'm-- I'm one of those people that just, like, loves adventure. Uh... Yeah, I guess I could just bring my laptop and do some work from there if I need to. Great. Adventure it is then. Okay. I guess I'll see you tomorrow then. Bye. Bye. Hi, guys. Um... I haven't posted in a while. You probably noticed. Um... I don't know if anyone's even gonna watch this, but my friend Deb told me that it might be, uh... really healthy for me to release some stuff and, um... I don't know. If I've learned one thing it's that Deb is always right, so... Ta-da! Uh, this is it? Yeah, you like? Um, yeah. Yeah, it seems nice. What? We're not here for the house. We're here for the hiking and the Joshua trees and the sunsets. I know you said you've been feeling a little cooped up lately so... I figured you could use a couple of days in the great outdoors. Mmm, so thoughtful. Thank you. You're the best. Yeah, we're kind of in the middle of nowhere, but it's cute. He said he thought I needed some time outside. I'm almost done, I swear. I just want to show Deb the place. Here, come here. Say hi. - Hey. - Hi. Took my girl out to the middle of nowhere, huh? Yep. Where are you guys, exactly? Uh, near Joshua Tree somewhere. I gotta pee. Nice to meet you. Um, so, how is everything going thus far? Great! I think he's just a little tired. Okay, um, well have fun, um, and be safe, please. And text me the address or just at least drop me a pin. I will. Love you! Love you! Everything good? Yeah! I was thinking maybe I'd get cleaned up and put on something more comfortable? Sounds great. Okay. Be back soon. Something's not right. -Huh? -I wasn't talking to you. Okay. Something's not right. I can feel it. What-- are-- are you talking to me now? Yes. Take your headphones off. What do you want? Just come here. What? I'm worried about Lilly. Oh, I'm shocked. Hey, hey! I'm being serious. Yeah, I know. So am I. You're worried about Lilly, like, legit 90 percent of the time. This is different. This guy has her in a random house in the desert. I just... I have a really bad feeling about it. That true crime shit's really warping your brain, huh? No, they practically just met and he takes her to some extremely remote mystery location as a surprise? He was super sketchy on the phone and apparently he has some really fucked-up past. And get this, I tried to look him up online and no pictures. I even tried to do a background check and nothing! Jesus, Deb! What?! Something is wrong! I'm-- I'm not crazy! Right? I mean, I don't know. I... I'm gonna track her phone. We have to know where she is. Right. Well, I'm gonna go back to my game. Hey. Hi. Wow. Yeah? You like? Yeah. -You look incredible. -Thanks. So I feel really vulnerable and kind of silly, but I really want to have sex with you this weekend. And I figure that it probably would happen eventually, so maybe it's better just to get it out of the way now because otherwise I'm gonna be super anxious and nervous about it all weekend. Okay. I guess we should just get it out of the way then. What's your tattoo mean? It's a birthmark. You're so special. Are you sure you want to do this? Just fuck me already. Her phone is off! What? Lilly's phone is off! How do you know? Because it disappeared on the app. Find my phone. That's how I know it's off! You need to leave her alone. Honey. The day that I picked up Lilly from the hospital I promised her I would never turn off my phone in case she needed me. And she swore to me that she would do the same. Since that day, she has not turned off her phone or let it die once. It's never off? No, never. Huh. I'm calling the police. To tell them what? They're not going to drive all the way out to the boondocks to check on her just 'cause her friend is worried about her. We don't even know if anything bad has actually happened. Maybe she just forgot her charger or something. No way. I'm calling them and telling them whatever I need to say for them to go and check up on her. Ehh, it's not really a great idea to lie to the police. And I don't even know where they are. You said you had her location on-- I did, but I didn't write it down! All right. Same team. It's good. It's all good, baby. It's all good. It's all good. what are you doing? Stop. Yes! Yes! It's like your eyes bleed opium. Although opium never did for me what you can. We make a good team. Stop trying to hide. I'm talking to you. Lilly. They say that the eyes are windows to the soul. When you look into mine, do you see anything there? Lilly, I'm not going to ask you again. You said you wanted to know more about me. Well... there is no software fix, no god, no drugs, no daredevil shit, no puppies to hug, no pussy that does anything for me. Nothing. It's all like styrofoam. But one little taste of you... And there's this explosion of pain and sorrow and anger and in that moment I know joy. I don't expect your feeble little brain to understand that, but... it's like I get to be a real boy even if it's just for a second. Can I go home now? -Please. Please. -No. No, baby. We're not done yet. Shh. Shh, shh. Are you not listening to me? I could kill you right now and I wouldn't feel anything. Not guilt or remorse. Nothing. I can watch the life leave your body and never think of it for a second afterwards. But then where would we be? That would be a total waste, and I'd just have to start over again with somebody else. Somebody disposable. But not you. I think I'm gonna keep you for a while. We're going. Get your bat. I-- mmm. Fine. I couldn't find my bat. Are you sure you want to do this? I mean, we don't even know where they are. Yes we do. I saw it on the map. I don't know the specific street name, but, once we're close, I'm sure it'll look familiar. But even if you're right, it's gonna take, like, three hours just to drive there. And then what? There's hundreds of houses out there. It could be any one of them. So we'll knock on doors all night. I'm not gonna let this happen again, okay? Okay. Okay. All right. Look, it was not your fault. You didn't know. I love you, but you need to get your ass in the fucking car right now. Okay. Hey. I am... so sorry that things got a little rough last night. I didn't mean to hurt you like that. But... you kind of made me do it. Is it okay if I sit? I think the best thing for us to do would be to just put it behind us and move on. Yeah? I want to show you something. I found this in the garage. It's just like what he used when he almost killed you, isn't it? Steel toe and everything. Oof. Yeah, I saw it sitting there... and I just started picturing it... You... huddled up in a little ball, kind of like you are now. So weak and helpless. Him just raining blow after blow down on you. Fracturing your ribs, breaking your skull. How long did it take you to recover? That man... was a monster. I would never do anything like that to you. You know that, right? Think of me... more like a gardener. I just want my beautiful Lilly to blossom. So, I'm gonna give her what she needs. Speaking of... Lilies need water, so... It's just water. Here. Take it. You need to hydrate. There you go. That's my girl. Can't let the tank go empty, can we? Okay, well... you get some rest and I'll be back in a little bit. So, where to next? I think just go north one more street and we'll turn left the next place we can and it's starting to look familiar. Okay. Hey. Ready for round two? Please. Don't act like I'm some pathetic rapist. I told you that's not what I want. What I want is this. This is incredible. I've lost track of how many times I've watched this. You want to see? He could make me feel so weak, and I would just sit there and cry while he screamed at me and I... You are not a strong person, Lilly. You let Tyler do anything he wanted to you. Why didn't you just leave? You must have had a thousand chances. It's because you couldn't. Right? Because you didn't want to. I don't know why I let him do that. And then he would hit me with his fist or whatever he could find nearby and I would tell myself that somehow I deserved it. And it was my fault. See? You said it yourself. There are some people in this world who are, at their core, victims. Born prey animals. That wasn't the first time someone hurt you, was it? And it wasn't gonna be the last. You have a role to play, and you play it over and over and over again. I wanted him to die. I wanted him to die so bad 'cause I knew that that's the only way I'd ever be rid of him. And I wished for it. I wished for it every single day. I sat there and I wished that he would die, and then he did. He died on the floor right in front of me-- right there-- and I was just heartbroken. And I am so fucking ashamed to admit that, but I was heartbroken 'cause I loved him. Despite everything that he did to me, I still loved him and I-- I'm just so confused. And I... I've spent every single day since just being consumed by the guilt and... so fucking confused. What is wrong with me? Wow. What is wrong with you? You killed him, Lilly. You can't say it wasn't your fault. Maybe if you'd been a more caring... supportive partner. More understanding of his mental illness, you wouldn't have been so miserable. But, no. You weren't. You were selfish. Self-absorbed. Completely consumed with your own shit. You put the bottle in his hand. You sat and watched as he tore himself apart drink by drink... and you just cowered there... as his head went right through that glass table... three feet in front of you... and then bled out all over the floor. I bet you can still smell the blood, can't you? If it's any consolation, I'm sure that he never really loved you. Because how could anyone love someone like you? No one will ever want to be with you except to use you. Like he did. Like I am. Because that's all you're good for. And deep down, you know that's what you deserve. Oh, yeah. Yeah. That's my girl. Yeah. Oh, that's so good. Mark! Lilly! Oh, my God, you're hurt! No, it's not my blood. I'm okay. I'm here. It's okay, I'm here. All right, come on, let's get you to the hospital. Let's go. No, police first. Wait, what are you guys doing here? I think you're in shock. -Come on. -I'm okay. I'm good. I'm good. I'm okay What did he do to you? He wanted me to cry.
