Monday, August 2, 1907. It's six o'clock in the morning. Today, my youngest son is going to leave our home. After 3 years of military academy, he enters His Majesty's Army. I hoped his first assignment would have been in town... or at least nearby. Instead, he's leaving for a lonely fort... on the most distant border of the empire... That horse... is a Tartar horse. GIORGIO SILVAGNI, BAHMAN FARMANARA PRESENT IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER Come on... Come on, wake up... it's six. THE DESERT OF THE TARTARS FROM THE HOMONYM NOVEL BY DINO BUZZATI I can't be as happy as you are... I can't blame you. I know... but I don't want to leave remembering you like this. I know how much it means to you. But it's sad for those who are left behind, too. Go now! You're lucky... You'll wake up everyday hearing the famous trumpets of Fort Bastiano! I don't even know what this fort looks like... I only know it's very far... You're the one who's going to live the most exciting adventure. Do you see those trees, over there? When I reach them, I won't turn back, and you won't see me anymore. Hey... Hey! Hey there! Captain... Sir! What is it? Nothing, Sir... I just wanted to salute you... Who are you? Lieutenant Drogo, Sir. Go on! Our paths will meet downhill. - I'm Captain Hortiz. - Lieutenant Drogo, sir. I suppose you're on the way to Bastiano? I'd given up the hope of ever finding the fort. Why? I must have taken the wrong way, Sir, and... If you're coming from that direction, you most certainly did. Those mountains are the border with the North Kingdom. No army could cross them... There's never been a fort around here. It'd be useless. Bastiano is farther on... to the north. I'm surprised that a messenger doesn't know where he's going... I'm not a messenger, Sir. I'm going to Bastiano for my first assignment. Congratulations, Lieutenant. You couldn't have made a better choice. - Two years, I suppose. - Sir? That's the rule. Two years on the border count double for seniority. I didn't know that, Sir, and I didn't choose Bastiano. - No? - I was ordered there. That's odd... usually... - Give me a drink, Strauss. - Yes, sir... What's odd, Captain? There aren't many volunteers for Bastiano these days... That's the reason why you were ordered there, I guess. - Would you like to drink? -Yes, please. - Here... -Thank you, Captain. Bastiano is a dead border station... - as you will see. -Thanks... It's alright, Lieutenant. It was a splinter under the hoof. What did the Captain mean with a "dead border station"? A border with nothing on the other side of it. Beyond the fort there is a desert... And then... nothing. The Desert of the Tartars... They may even have crossed it, centuries ago. But they vanished, after destroying the ancient city. The desert has kept their name. But the older history is, the more men change it into legend. So, we don't know what's true and what isn't. I've lived at Bastiano Fort for eighteen years. I must say the place is more lively on the inside than you could say from here. I see you are in a hurry to report. Ride ahead... Go... go ahead, Lieutenant... Halt! Advance and be recognized! I'm Lieutenant Drogo. Assigned to Fort Bastiano. I've come to take up my post. I'm Lieutenant Simeon. Lieutenant Drogo. Welcome to Bastiano. Thank you. Lazare! Marshal Tronk. Take the Lieutenant's horse. Come with me, I'll take you to meet Major Matti. - Take over, Tronk. - But, we're in the middle of a training! So what? In case of alarm, the commissioned officer on duty takes command. That's the rule, Sir. Yes, Tronk, that's Paragraph 3. But paragraph 12 says: "Guard posts not immediately exposed to attack, which is this case... may be placed under the command of a high-ranking non-commissioned officer". Any objections? None, Sir. Fine. Come with me, Lieutenant Drogo. It's not your fault, but you've arrived at the worst possible moment. I'm sorry, Sir. Colonel, this is Lieutenant Drogo. I'm delighted to welcome you to Bastiano. The King himself has called us "the noblest guardian of His crown... Our regiment is an enviable assignment for an ambitious young officer. You'll soon see for yourself. I'm listening, Lieutenant... All positions ready to open fire 6 minutes before the general alarm. Six minutes, you say? Five minutes and 42 seconds. It's a pity you're leaving us, Lieutenant. As a soldier... I'll miss you. If I may say so... I'll miss you too, Sir. As a soldier... You may go... A fine officer. But all the same... a good riddance. Would you like to be introduced to His Excellency now, or tonight at dinner? Tonight at dinner, Sir. It will be an honor. Good evening, Lieutenant Drogo. My name's Rovine. I'm the doctor here. Your medical file just arrived on my table. Welcome to Bastiano. Thanks, Sir. Excuse me, Colonel. Let me introduce to you... Lieutenant Drogo. - Sir... - No, thank you. Don't insist, I already told you... You must take a decision... You're in bad shape... I'm stealing the Lieutenant from you. Come with me, Drogo... What's wrong with the Lieutenant Colonel's health? A glorious battle wound... from the time when there were still wars... Broken back... Steel corset... He's the only one here, who's actually been under fire. Why you persist? You'd be better off stationed in town. Oh, right, you just arrived from the city... help me convince him! - Keep out of this, Lieutenant. - Be careful, for god's sake... Getting involved in Rathenau's and Amerling's bickering can be dangerous! Sirs! His Excellency! Welcome back, Hortiz. I hope your travel was fine. Thank you, Sir. Dear Nathanson... General Conrad greets you. He would like to have your help for the maneuvers in the south. Please help yourself... Carry on... please. Please, Sirs... This is Lieutenant Drogo, Sir. He has arrived this morning. My papers are at the headquarters. I request the honor of introducing myself to you. My name is Jean Baptiste Drogo, Infantry Lieutenant on first assignment. Good evening, your Excellency. Good evening, gentlemen. Good evening, Lieutenant Drogo. His Excellency, the Colonel, Count of Filimore... commander in chief of the garrison, invites you to join us... Colonel Nathanson... Good evening, Lieutenant Drogo. I am in command of your company. Captain Hortiz... Good evening, Lieutenant Drogo. I am in command of the garrison's artillery. Captain Von Sern... We already met... I am doctor Rovine... Major doctor Rovine. I am Simeon, senior subordinate officer of the garrison. Lieutenant Simeon. Good evening, Lieutenant Drogo. I'm Amerling. Lieutenant Von Amerling... - Good evening, Lieutenant Drogo. - Lieutenant Von Rathenau. I am Maude. Good evening, Lieutenant Drogo. Lieutenant Maude... Good evening, Lieutenant Drogo. My name's Von Arnim. Lieutenant Von Arnim. Good evening, Lieutenant Drogo. I'm Sarteris. Lieutenant Sarteris. - Good evening, Lieutenant Drogo. - Lieutenant Gothard... I'm second Lieutenant Morel. Good evening, Lieutenant Drogo. Second Lieutenant Morel. Good evening, Lieutenant Drogo. Will you dine with us? Thank you, Excellency. Thank you, Sirs. I am honored. You can only see the desert from the advance post. What can you see from there? Stones... sand... dust... And almost always, mist. But further, to the north... You must be able to see something? Nothing but mist... in winter and summer. Still... there are some who insist... that they've seen riders on white horses. Patrols from the North Kingdom? Maybe not... Where else could they come from? From the desert... If it were true, the General Staff would know about it... There are things they prefer not to talk about... Colonel Filimore himself, he never mentions them. - As for Hortiz... - Captain Hortiz? It happened shortly after he arrived here... He was in charge of the outpost. He suddenly spotted them... just at the edge of the mist... Hortiz saw those riders? He even gave the alarm... He had a cannon shot fired. A serious decision... An officer like Hortiz would never have done it... if he was not sure. When dawn came, the riders had disappeared... So he was the only one who saw them. This morning he told me that Fort Bastiano is a "dead border station"... overlooking nothing. He also spoke of legends... But he's stayed here, waiting... Waiting for what? The enemy. May he come from the North Kingdom, or the desert... Hortiz may not believe so strongly, now... but he's waiting, just like the others... Calm down, Colonel... please! Try to stay calm for a moment... Alright, alright... I'll help you, don't worry! How can I make you an injection?! Calm down! Give me a hand! Hold him, hurry! Keep him still! What is he saying? He wants you to put your hand on his mouth... Keep him still! You can let him go, Lieutenant. The drug acts almost immediately. - I just can't believe it... - What? That in three days I'll be back in town... and I won't see this fort anymore. But you... You'll be seeing my family? Listen... if you want, I can wait for you... No... I already told you, I like Bastiano, and I feel fine. That's what you're going to tell my mother. Promise me... What else could I tell her, the truth? That for you, staying another day at Bastiano equals suicide? You mustn't be late. - Good bye. - Bye. Alright. You've been frank with me, and I'll be frank with you. In order to stay at Bastiano, twice a year, we all have to pass a medical examination Me... Lieutenant Colonel Nathanson... the Colonel himself... Everyone... it's the rule. When your turn comes, I promise to get you a negative report. You can count on me. Is that clear, Lieutenant? Yes, Sir. I don't know how to thank you... Fine... the next examination will be in four months' time. Four months? That's the best I can do, Lieutenant. What if I would send in an application? It's a risk for your career. Think about it... Applying for a transfer at your first assignment could harm you. If you follow my suggestion, you'll have time to show your value. Four months... that's not so bad! I believe you're right, Sir... I thank you for your advice... Let's keep this between you and me. - Good morning, Sir. - Lieutenant Drogo... Your platoon moved in ahead of Lieutenant Sarteris' at roll call. He's your senior, here. Lieutenant Sarteris' platoon was late, Sir... Don't let this happen anymore. Your men are well disciplined. Congratulations. So I'm all the more sorry you made the decision to leave us. Don't be surprised... Everybody knows about your agreement with Major Mattis. Many young officers have come to Bastiano just like you. And those who have chosen to stay, don't feel inferior. I never thought anything like that, Sir. I wanted a different assignment. It was mere chance that I was sent here. And if the chance wants you to stay? Maybe that's what happened to me. It's more probable that chance had nothing to do with any of it. Close ranks, Lazare! Get a move on! - Come on, you stupid mule! - Hey, Lazare! Move on! Come on, move! Coming off guard... To attention! Present arms! Platoon... halt! Turn on the right! Ground arms! Coming off guard, ground arms! Stand at ease! - Is this your first duty out here? - Yes. Rather boring, but you'll get used to it. Night falls early, this time of year... Sooner or later, in this darkness, something's going to happen... The Colonel should be warned of the danger. What danger? You see Lieutenant Amerling's unit, over there? It'll be dark when they get back to the fort, like we'll do tomorrow. Just like you, Lieutenant Von Amerling has three different passwords. The one he used when he left, the one he used today... and the one he will need to re-enter the fort. Because, meanwhile, the guards will have come off duty. - What of it? - Well... Let's suppose that the only officer who knows the password falls sick... In that case, the returning guarding unit couldn't re-enter the fort. Because nobody but that officer knows the password. - The sentries would recognize them. - In the dark? And what if the returning guarding unit was attacked by surprise... and wiped out by an enemy patrol between here and the fort? The enemy soldiers could put on our uniforms. True... Without the password, nobody coming from the North Valley... and I mean nobody, can enter the front. Guard! Lookout! Tronk! - Tronk! - At your orders, Sir. Tronk... I may be mistaken... But it seems to me that... - Alarm! Alarm! - Alarm! There's something out there, alarm! Take your positions! Quick! Back to your posts, not a sound! - Double the sentries, Corporal. - Yes, Sir. - Up to the platform! -Yes, Sir! - Machine guns ready! - It's vanished, now! - I can't see anything, now... - Machine guns ready to fire! They can tell, Sir... What do you mean? The horses, they can feel them coming... Them who? Shut up! From where? And who are they? There's only the desert out there... miles and miles of desert... Tronk... Would you give the alarm? To fire the cannon is always a serious decision... In a couple of minutes, the fort would be on war... I'd wait till dawn, Sir... What do you think, Tronk? Nothing yet, Sir. Ask the corporal to come here, and get back to your cannon. Yes, Sir. So... Now tell me what you think... That horse isn't from Bastiano, Sir. At Bastiano, maybe you haven't noticed, all the horses are black. So, where would it come from? Relieve the night guard, Corporal. Put three gunners at the cannon, ready to fire. Tronk... Would you advise me to give the alarm, now? No Sir, not yet... But we should be prepared to do it, any moment... That horse... what is the danger of a lone horse? It could mean that danger is on the way. From the North Kingdom? Their horsemen have never ventured into the desert... At least, not until now... Then call them with their name! I want to hear you say that word! That horse... is a Tartar horse. Nothing's going to happen... No one's coming... We spent the whole day staring at that horse. Lazare, on your post! C'mon, Lazare! I know how you feel, Sir... but the border is just below us... - Rules are rules. - What rules? That horse out there has nothing to do with your rules! Alright, Tronk... You're right. I won't send anyone to bring the horse in... because it's against regulations. Our relief will be here in an hour. And it will soon be dark... - Halt! Who's there? - Guard returning from the outpost. - Give the password! - "Sword and banner". Open the door! - Guard, halt! Turn on the left! - Stand at ease... - Tronk, call the roll and dismiss. - Yes, Sir. - Corporal, call the roll. - Yes, Sir. - Merru... - Present! - Sveta... - Present! - Vicinic... - Present! - Filey... - Present! - Fratz... - Present! - Haus... - Present! Lazare... - Lazare! - Present... That horse should have been captured and examined! But, the regulations, Sir... There are situations where an officer must take responsibility. You may go... Stay here, Lieutenant... You behaved wisely... First, by not alerting the fort. Am I right, Excellency? It was just a horse without a horseman. Secondly, you followed regulations to the letter. I congratulate you... A border is a border... Only the Colonel could have taken the initiative to capture that horse. Captain, do you think that horse belonged to a military unit? - Answer me, Captain. - No, I don't think so, Sir. Still, you reckon that this incident is suspect... Yes, Major. Then why haven't you doubled the guards? Can't you see this is a moment in which regulations should be applied strictly? Come with me, Lieutenant. - A white horse, you said? - Yes, Your Excellency. Call me Colonel, please... I'm honored, Colonel. - No special marks? - No, Sir. And no saddle... - It must have gone away by now... - Probably, Colonel. Do you think I should have trespassed the border to catch it? Regulations are regulations, Lieutenant... It's certainly the Colonel's opinion. You may go now, Major... You must not blame yourself, Lieutenant. Major Mattis is right... There's nothing we can do about it. - Who goes there? - Private Lazare, mule driver. Listen, friend, I've broken regulations, try to keep it quiet... I'm bringing back the horse! Go to the entrance and give the password! The password?! How should I know it! Don't you understand, guard? Didn't you hear about the horse? Look, I'm bringing it in! Let me in, c'mon! Are you going to open up or not? - The password! - I told you... I don't know it! We surely know each other! I am Lazare! I can't see you, but... What are you doing? You're not going to shoot! No! Don't shoot! No! - Alarm! - Alarm! - Alarm! - Everybody on your posts! - Open the door! - You can't go out, Sir. Get off! Lazare! Right between the eyes. Who fired? Private Kupka. First rate shot. I trained him myself... - And who's this? - Private Lazare, Sir. A deserter... Being the officer on duty, it's my job to find out how the tragedy occurred. "Tragedy"? Stop being dramatic, Captain! Lazare tried to bring the horse back to the fort, Sir. The sentry can testify. Sure, he'll testify! And he'll confirm that this soldier was a traitor! You also have a few things to explain, Lieutenant. This soldier was in your unit, wasn't he? Yes, Sir. His disobedience could have caused a serious incident! The North Kingdom might protest for border violation! You can't be serious, Sir! Deal with this, Tronk. Have him buried, without honors! Yes, Sir. Marshal! - Order... arms. - Yes, Sir. Order... arms! Order... arms! Order... arms! Order... arms! Order... arms! What's going on? Tronk, I asked you what's going on! The third platoon refuses to obey orders, Sir... It's private Lazare's section. They refused to present arms before the flag. This is a mutiny... These men belong to your company, Captain... And to your platoon, Lieutenant! I demand a report, immediately! Order... arms! You bastards... You fucking bastards! You bunch of swines! Bastards! You bastards! Alright... let them stand there. Without food and water! As long as they refuse to obey! Marshal, break the ranks! My report, Colonel. What do you want from them, Major? First, their submission. Then, I want them severely punished. The dead soldier was one of them, wasn't he? That's no excuse, Colonel. Those men refused to present arms before their officers and the flag! And they disobeyed orders! Platoon... stand at attention! Order... arms! Captain Hortiz, have these men taken to their cells. Four days of bread and water. You have a heart condition, this altitude is bad for your system. Will that do? Perfect. Thank you, Doctor. Bastiano is probably bad for everyone. God himself would have troubles living here. You're thinking about Amerling's illness? Yes... Amerling's and other people's too. Some nasty germs have been trapped in these walls for centuries... There's no cure. And it's impossible to find its origin... Even the specialists in the capital weren't able find a cure. - You're wise to leave... - But, that's not the reason... I was sent here by mistake... Here or elsewhere... we're all somewhere by mistake. You're wise. If I could, I'd do the same... Couldn't you ask for a transfer? Yes, I could, of course... but I'd feel like a deserter... With this certificate, you can leave whenever you like. All you need is the General's signature... You're lucky, he'll be here in two weeks. Less than what it would take sending it to town and waiting for an answer. Thank you. - Goodbye, Lieutenant. - Goodbye. Touched! You're really good, and I'm not as young as you are. I ask your permission to retire. You don't seem tired, Captain... You think I can't last till the end of the match? I really wanted to stop, Amerling, but if you want to continue... Thank you, Sir. Thank you. Garrison! Stand at attention! On your knees! I'm afraid, and I place my trust in Thee, my Lord... O Lord, grant us peace! Listen to me, Lord, turn not Thy face away from me. Bless my soul and wash away my sins. Jesus, have mercy upon us. Saturday night, as the first day of the week was dawning... Mary Magdalene and the other Maria, after bought some essences... came to see Jesus' sepulchre to embalm him. And then an angel came, descending from up above... He knocked over the stone, and sat on it. He looked like a thunderbolt, and his dress was white as snow... The guards, frightened, fell on the ground as if they were dead. But the Angel smiled, and said to the women: "Don't be afraid, the man you are looking for, isn't here... He rose again from the death, on the third day, as he had foretold... and has gone to Galilea. You will meet him there. They have swords and shields... I'm sorry, Sir? What are you talking about? The horsemen in the desert. The men I saw once, a long time ago. They ride white horses. They don't want anyone to see their swords gleaming in the sun. They let them tarnish. An old warriors' trick. Is this what you wanted me to say? Why I stayed here? To wait for them... - This is Captain Hortiz... - Good evening, Captain. General... Our dear Nathanson... - I'm happy to see you, how is it? - Fine, Excellency, I feel better. - Lieutenants Von Amerling... - Sir. - Von Arnim... - General... - Maude... - Excellency. First lieutenant Gothard. I'm honored, Your Excellency. - Lieutenant Sarteris. - General... Ah, Sarteris... your mother is my wife's friend. They meet often. She always asks me about you, I'll tell her that we've met. Thank you very much, Sir. - Lieutenant Morel. - Good evening, Excellency. Good evening, Lieutenant. - Major Mattis. - Nice to see you. I'm honored. - Captain Von Sern... - Captain... - Lieutenant Simeon. - Ah, Simeon... I knew your father, we were together in the academy. I know, sir... - This is Lieutenant Drogo. - Lieutenant... You're new at Bastiano, aren't you... I've been here four months, Sir. I consider Lieutenant Drogo as one of the garrison's best officer. I'm not surprised, Filimore, Bastiano attracts all of our best young men. - I'm happy to see you here. - Dinner is served, Sirs. This way, Excellency. Good idea! This ceremony has given me appetite. I envy you, Filimore... you have the best garrison, the best officers... the finest cooks of the kingdom. I ask myself if Bastiano has a weak spot? Dear Colonel, I want to tell you a stow that... - ls something wrong, Drogo? - No doctor, nothing... Shall I have the General sign your certificate for you? No, thank you... Then, don't just stand there. Come and sit... I'm going this way... - This time we lost our prey, Sir. - You lost it, not me... Next time, Lieutenant, don't provoke me with these kinds of games. And don't try with others. You would lose in any case. Yes, until it's a game... Major! Look over there... How many are they? About one company, I think. That soldier... the one who brought that horse to our fort... Do you remember, Drogo? Yes, Colonel, I remember. It's too bad we never found where that horse came from... Come in, please. Colonel... Lieutenant Amerling just came back... He believes the enemy will be in sight in a few minutes. - Did you say "the enemy", Major? - Yes, Colonel. Those soldiers are advancing armed, according to the rules of engagement. They wanted to take us by surprise, after skirting the desert... avoiding to be seen by the outpost. Thank you... you may go, Major. Colonel, Sir... aren't you going to order a general alarm? Major, I appreciate your sense of duty, as always. Summon all the officers for the usual daily report, in 10 minutes. - But, Colonel... - You may go now, Major. Please stay, Lieutenant... Stay, phase... What's this confusion? Go back to your places! You've no business here! Clear the parapets! Move! Colonel, the officers are here to report. Sit down, please, Colonel Nathanson. Sit down, gentlemen... Did you want to say something, Major? There are more on the way, Colonel. They're spreading out along the border. You can see them from the window. No, I don't think so. Stay where you are, Major. I'll ask you to look out, if I feel it necessary. I'm sorry to have to say this... I have noticed... I noticed that, during the changing of the guard, some units arrive... without their commanding officers. Colonel, we're wasting valuable time! Lieutenant Malevic, Excellency. I bring a message from Your Excellency the Chief of the General Staff. Excuse me, gentlemen... Thank you, Lieutenant. You must be exhausted... Lieutenant Von Arnim will look after you. Dear Officers... I noticed that this morning, our soldiers... and you too... were somewhat troubled... by the presence of unidentified troops spotted in the North Valley. The troops are from the North Kingdom, sent here simply to survey the border line, just like we did ourselves a few years ago. Good... The units in question will not come to our fort. They won't. They'll break up in small groups over the mountains, to carry on their mission This is what the Chief of the General Staff told me in his message. He also asked me to organize an expedition without any delay... to establish the border line on our side, along one mountain area... that hasn't been surveyed yet. I don't need to add that it would be best if we reached first... to the north brink, to take its possession, without any incident. Colonel, as the only engineer co-officer of this garrison... I ask authorization to command the expedition. Yes, of course. Pick the men you need and leave at dawn. Have them take warm clothing. Dear gentlemen, you can leave... You're going to have a hard time walking in those things. I wouldn't want to stop because of stupid reasons... They're going to hurt, you'll see. - Sergeant! - Yes, Sir. - We'll camp here. - Platoon, halt! Have the first unit set up their tents. The men who will go on top can rest. Yes, Sir. Sergeant, set up the tents and discharge the mules... Hey, you... light the fire, and distribute the meals. I see you're in good shape. I feel very well, thank you, Sir... It's a pity we don't come up here more often. Wonderful place. In that case, you can come with me on the climb. That's what you want the most, isn't it? I wasn't expecting such an honor. Don't ever loose the contact with the fellow that's towards you. If you're left behind, fire 3 shots. We'll stop and fire more shots, so you can reach us. No matter what, you mustn't put off your gloves! You, cover up your head! Platoon... stand to attention! Twenty soldiers and two officers, Sir. - Alright, Lieutenant. - Godspeed, Major. Goodbye, Drogo. Goodbye. - With God's help... let's go... - Platoon, form a line... Go, ahead! I wish I could go with you to Amerling's family, to tell his mother that... I'm sure you'll find the right words. Will you come back to the fort, Drogo? I don't know, Captain... I asked for a permit. I'll go see the General. See you... This is unheard of! You can't ask me to leave the fort! I'm not asking you, Major. I have made my decision. It's not regulation... only the General can... The General promised me that he'd give you a splendid assignment, where your remarkable ability to command, will be appreciated. I'm surprised by your sudden interest in me, Colonel... And I am not. I've always appreciated your devotion to duty... But I don't belong to your world, isn't it? Tell me the truth! You've never considered me equal to the officers of your class. You just put up with me, and you know why! You let me handle the jobs you didn't want to touch yourself. But you never had anything but contempt for me! It's because of Amerling, that you're asking for my leaving... You hold me responsible for his death! You're the one who feels like that, and you're pleased by this thought. You're quite mistaken! No... You had nothing to do with the death of Count Von Amerling. Nothing! It's something you can't understand. It's beyond what you are... beyond anything you will ever be! Here is your promotion to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel. I congratulate you... Lieutenant Drogo? The General's waiting for you. I'm Lieutenant Drogo, Sir. Bastiano... yes, sure! Please, come in and sit down. You are from the fort that gave us plenty of troubles... over that border matter. His Highness accepts no compromise about the empire's integrity. A mountain peak is a mountain peak. And that Lieutenant... Von Amerling, Sir. Count Peter Von Amerling... His stubbornness lost us a mountain peak! Sir, Von Amerling is the one who died... Ah, is that so? So... please, sit down... In any case, the whole business made a bad impression. Enough of that! You're here because you want a new assignment, aren't you? Bring me the file of Lieutenant... Uh, what's your name? - Drogo. - Drogo! You would like to get an assignment in town, I suppose. - Yes, Sir, if it can be arranged... - Sure! Why not... Do you know Bastiano's weak point, Lieutenant? No, Sir, I have no idea... There are too many men... That's the weak point, too many of 'em... That's why it was decided to reduce its troops. - Reduce the troops at Bastiano? - You didn't know? No, Sir... I can't seem to find your transfer application... - I didn't make an official request... - So? But I think this paper will do... It's a medical certificate, Sir. Oh, well, if it's a medical certificate, I understand... And I also see it was made out a long time ago! Not that I doubt its validity, but it's a bit too old... That's quite unpleasant... If your health was so bad... that it didn't allow you to stay... to stay in Bastiano, then why didn't you leave the fort? But, I was assured that... You will return to the fort, Lieutenant... to settle this problem. That is, if you're still in poor health. Wouldn't be easier for me to make a normal application for transfer? No, Lieutenant. That was possible before, but not now... We're reducing the staff at Bastiano, we'll give preference to officers who have made regular applications. But when, Sir? I never heard it mentioned. How should I know? You wouldn't dare to ask me for some favoritism, would you? No, Sir. Goodbye, my friend. Keep me informed... C'mon, I may seem severe, but I like receiving young officers... At your age, an occasional scolding doesn't do any harm... Goodbye, Lieutenant... Platoon... turn left! Close the ranks! - Welcome back, Lieutenant. - Are you leaving, Tronk? No, Lieutenant. I'm staying... Colonel, Sir... Drogo... you came back... My little private space... As time goes by, we accumulate things without realizing, until the day... Follow me, Drogo... The General told me about a reduction of the strength... I didn't expect it to be so severe... or that you'd be leaving too, Sir. Neither did I... It took everyone by surprise... Usually things proceed... more slowly. Do you know why the General Staff has called you back, Sir? No, they probably think I've been here long enough... that I'm too old. It's up to you to take my place, my young friend... Will you do me the honor of having a last drink together? Of course, Sir. I'd be delighted. I was afraid I wouldn't have the chance of bidding farewell to you... - Here it is... cheers. - Thank you. You wanted to leave too, didn't you? There's been a misunderstanding regarding my file. - I hope my command is not responsible... - I'm the only one to blame. Would you like me to put in a word, to speed things up for you? I thank you, Colonel, but I don't mind staying a while longer at the fort. - Hortiz will be happy to have you. - Captain Hortiz is staying? Major Hortiz... he's replacing me as commander of Fort Bastiano. It was my wish... If you'll excuse me, I still have a great deal to do... I won't be coming to the refectory again. Take care of yourself, my friend... - Sir... - Goodbye. Ah, you came back... What is it? - You don't seem pleased to see me... - I just thought you'd never come back. - Any news, down there? - Nothing, as usual. - May I have it back? I must go... - Please, just one moment... - What are you looking at?! - Nothing in particular... - Listen, they're waiting for me, I must.. - There's a light, down there! A light?! What are you talking about? Have you gone crazy? There isn't just one light, there are three... four... no, five! Oh, come on... that's absurd! Then look... look over there! Look at them, in between those mountains... over there! Don't tell me you don't see anything! I wouldn't believe you! I discovered them 3 weeks ago... I was waiting to tell you... Why? I was afraid you wouldn't believe me, and laugh at the idea... So you don't have to tell anybody about it! The lights are there, everyone can see them! No, not without a special field glass like this... We should tell Hortiz, at least! No... They would cancel the departures... You can't imagine how many of them would take advantage... of this opportunity to stay! What opportunity? If something finally happens, the fewer of us, the better! What are you saying?! It's probably a nomads' camp. No... They would move. In three weeks time the lights would have vanished. It seems like a construction site... they're building a road. A road? In the desert? Who could they be? And what would be the use of it? To reach us faster. To transport heavy weapons... like cannons! Cannons across the desert? Listen, Simeon... - Do you really believe that? - Think what you like! But don't tell a soul! Is it clear? Ok, I believe it's best not to. But leave me your field glass, will you? Colonel... would you do us the honor of presiding at our table? Sit down, gentlemen... Thank you... I beg your pardon for being late... What are you looking at, Lieutenant? And what are you and Captain Simeon plotting together? A secret... that has become too heavy for us. We were planning to tell you, of course... but we wanted to be certain. Certain of what? Here... look for yourself, Major. There, straight that way... What was I supposed to see, Lieutenant? But, Sir, those dim lights... Straight in front of us... I don't know what you're talking about... I didn't see a thing. Nothing at all... Absolutely nothing. Listen... I don't want a rumor, based on an optical illusion... to spread in the fort. In the past, irresponsibility damaged the reputation of this fort. I know... but, Sir... this time... Is that clear, Lieutenant? Yes, Major, Sir. I have just received your promotion to the rank of Captain. Congratulations... - Anything else, Captain? - No, you may go... He says they're advancing, but they're still invisible to the naked eye... I can't understand it... Maybe they're having some problem. Maybe they don't want to alarm us by coming too fast... They're pretending the road is of no great importance. Yes... of course! That must be it! Yes! They hope that in time, the lights and the road will seem normal to us. And the proof is Hortiz's attitude. He never mentions it, he's not worried... Who's on guard at the outpost? Sarteris, but with his field glass he can't see them. I don't trust Sarteris, I don't trust anybody... - Are you sure they're coming toward us? - Absolutely. I've got two points of reference. I can't be wrong... it's impossible. Stay down... Come on, cover yourself... Ok? I'm going... It could take them years... Years? Yes... Haven't you noticed how Hortiz has aged? The commanding officer of this fort, request that... all officers and soldiers of this garrison... ignore the rumors about an impending invasion of our borders. Therefore, any officer on duty will verify... that guards and sentries on duty at the outpost... use only regular optical field glasses. Go on, Captain... Therefore, anyone possessing irregular optical instruments... which often cause mistaken evaluations... will immediately surrender such instruments. An officer will confiscate them and keep them in a safe place. Missed! I can't understand why Hortiz gave that order. What does it matter, now? Nobody really believes in the road's existence... Not even I... What do you mean, "not even I"? Bulls eye! I hope you didn't turn in your field glass... What else was I supposed to do? It was an order! Without it, we won't see them anymore! See what? Who? You just won't see that far, that's all. Come in... - Were you looking for me, Sir? - Yes. Would you have tea with me? Of course, Sir... with pleasure. I have made the decision to abandon the outpost. May I ask why, Colonel? I haven't enough men to keep a permanent guard out there. But, it's the only place from which we can have advance warning... That's enough, Drogo. I've had enough... Nothing you can say will make any difference. I already signed the order. Excuse me, Colonel... I can't understand what's happening here... You can't give an order like this... An inspection guard will be sent there every ten days. I place you in command of it. Company! Stand at attention! Present arms! For Colonel Hortiz... - Hip, hip, hip... - Hurrah! Do I have your permission to enter the refectory hall? You're welcome, Colonel... Would you like anything? May I serve you? Just a coffee... Where have you been assigned? I'm going nowhere, Drogo... Things will be different here, from now on... It would be better for me to leave... Why? You're second in command now, in a few years, you'll take Simeon's place. But still, nothing will happen... - Do you really have to leave? - I received orders... And obeying is the thing I did best in my life... I hope you'll be in command of the fort, when the enemy will attack... and I know it will. Even if I was ordered to ignore it. What nonsense, and what disregard... I might have been useful in wartime... I'm so regretful... I waited for such a long time... without knowing why... I'm glad you kept me company this far... Now you must go back... Have we ever shaken hands? Never, Sir... Go away! Go! Drink this, Captain. It's freezing on this platform, at night. Come on, take it. I'll have your horse saddled... let's go back... - Are you certain? - Absolutely, Major. Sergeant Tronk saw them too... The cannon... My God, the cannon... So... it's finally happening... what do I have to do?! I can't... They fired the cannon... Tronk ordered to fire the cannon... The Tartars! They're coming! Did you hear that, Sir? The enemy's coming towards the fort! - You're improved since tonight. - Oh, yes... - I want to get up... - I wouldn't advise that. Come on, Rovine, haven't you heard... the enemy is advancing... Yes, battalions and battalions! And you want to keep me in bed? I haven't decided this by myself... What do you mean? Who took this decision? You ought to rest for a day or two... Major Simeon wants you to stay in your room. Simeon? He came to see you last night, he didn't think you looked well. He should mind his business! Have they sent a messenger to town? Sergeant Lobis left after the first cannon shot... By now, the General Staff should have been informed. Damn it! Will you let me know what's happening? Remember that I'm second in command at Bastiano! - What are you doing?! - Sir... Stay calm, come on! Don' t be agitated, come on... Come on, stay calm... Go to hell, Rovine... Leave me... leave me alone... The cannons are in sight... What is he saying? Rovine! I'm sorry, my friend... It's not your fault that I fell ill in a moment like this. Maybe you're right... Without any doubts, in fact. You'll make it, I know... - Call Kreysky... - He's on guard duty, Captain... Everyone's been mobilized... except me! They say I'm too old... Please, help me... Ah, Drogo... I looked all over for you... I didn't know what to do. Decisions have to be made, and... It seems you already made them without me... Of course, I had to. I intended to tell you, anyway. Do you feel better now? Yes... I'm fit for duty. I'm glad to hear it. I sent a messenger asking for two regiments. What if the enemy attacks before they arrive? I've concentrated the artillery here at the outpost... to hit them from the side. Isn't it dangerous to weaken the fort? Not at all... I hope you agree. We'll open fire only when we're attacked, not before. Why not? They could be... provoking us. Nonsense! No one sends out a whole army for provocation... Is it really an army? Yes... Look for yourself... Take this... Are they easy to see? Yes... Their vanguard is in full sight. Look... Captain, Sir! Drogo, what's wrong? Don't worry, Simeon. I won't cause you any more troubles... Tomorrow I'll be able to help you... Where are they now? They haven't moved. They must be waiting for reinforcements. The best strategy... would be to keep them from establishing a firm position. Of course... The best move... would be to open fire immediately. Don't you agree? Maybe... But I can't act all by myself... If there's anything I can do, just tell me... I feel better already... I can't stand to stay in this room... Don't think I've forgotten you. I even have some good news, for you. Today, a very comfortable carriage will arrive here... What for? War or not war, friends come first... I won't leave you here in this room, when you'd get better care in town... You might have asked me... You were sleeping... - Rovine told you to do it? - No, you know Rovine... The enemy is at the gates, and he keeps on scraping the walls... No, no... he just thinks you'd benefit from a change of air... He told me so. That's all... I have no intentions of leaving, Simeon... I thought I was doing the best for you... It's been so many years... I've waited so many years for this day to come... I sacrificed everything for it... Everything... And now... Now that the enemy... Now that war... I don't want to leave... You can't ask me this... - It's impossible! Not you! - Come on, Drogo! Yes, you're right. I'm sorry... Anyway. l--- I'm not able to endure such a long trip. You were talking about getting up, making yourself useful... It's not the same thing... Do you really want to be useful? When the reinforcements come, I could billet 3 officers in this room... Two beds along this wall, and the third over there, in that corner... I'm sorry to say so... But that's the only way you can be useful to me and this fort... This will be your way to help us in war. By leaving my post? What else can you do in your condition?! I understand... but don't insist. I won't leave... All right... if you're going to take it that way! I spoke to you as a friend... Now your commanding officer is speaking. I know your sense of discipline... and I know you will obey. You'll travel under the best possible conditions... You don't know how many of us would like to be in your place... Don't worry... I'll write in my report that you held out to the end of your strength... and that your courage... was an example to us all. In life... everybody has to accept the role... which was destined to him. Goodbye... When you want, Captain, I'm ready... Just one more minute, soldier... Drogo!
