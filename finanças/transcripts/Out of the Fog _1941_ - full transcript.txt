It's your turn. You take a card. This is not cards. This is torture. I can do better sitting in a rocking-chair and knitting. Am I giving you an argument? Bourbon, straight. One bourbon coming up. Here's a Jack. I hope you don't need it. A Jack I need? A doctor I need. Why don't you give me decent cards? My luck. My cards are just like my business. Look at them. Like cheapskates playing the chamber of commerce. Merchants of the community. Like clockwork, they come in every day and order the same food. They play the same game of cards. They even play the same records. And I got to listen to the same bellyaching about their business. And when they leave. I get the same crummy nickel tip. I ask you, mister. Is there any percentage in that? I ask you. - Another bourbon. Another bourbon coming up. Good evening, Mr Propotkin. Hello, Sam. - Good evening. Hi, Eddie. Fine thanks, Mac. Nice weather, eh? - Yeah. Hey, Olaf. A hot plate for the law. What's new on the beat, Lieutenant? Anything exciting? I'll take my coffee now, Eddie. - Yes, sir. Ask the Lieutenant what else he wants to drink. Thanks. But I can buy my own. How much do I owe you? - Four bits. A fifty out of five. Two bourbons. If she feels like that, why don't she sit here and take in the cash herself? Instead of staying in the kitchen making passes at the chef. By the way, the chef that works here. What's his name again? Olaf. Olaf Johnson. Does he own a fishing boat round here? - That's right. Eddie .. I want to eat tonight, not tomorrow. How about it back there? - Coming up. Be careful, Eddie. The plates are hot. This is for Igor. They made it just the way he wants. Olaf. All day, all day. You have everything on your mind but your work. You didn't clean up the kitchen. - The kitchen is clean. The floor is going to be washed. - The floor is washed. That clock .. always that clock. Counting the minutes. Counting seconds. Can't you at least talk to me? I'm a simple man. I can only keep my mind on one thing at a time. Tomorrow, I think I put a little more garlic in the sauce. Olaf. Yes? Olaf, what is a man without a woman? Nothing. - Exactly. I'm a lonely woman. And growing older. I need the strong arms of a dependable man to lean on. It's getting hot here. I could make out in a fish tavern three times this size. If I only had some help. - Size isn't everything. I'm growing no younger, Olaf. I need .. I need to take out the garbage. Please excuse me. Olaf. Meatballs, sauce and spaghetti. - Oh, I'll do it. Jonah. Jonah. Yes, Olaf. Yes? Is something wrong? She's still in the kitchen. I cannot leave yet. You're off. It's past 8 o'clock. Don't worry. Only be a few minutes. I will call you as soon as she leaves. Hey Magruder. There's a fire on the pier. What, a fire? - A fire? Where? It ain't a big one. Just Carny's boat. Another fishing boat? Is it still burning? Whatever is left of it. The fog is so thick nobody noticed the smoke. I'll have a look. Eddie, keep my plate hot. Wait a minute, Mac. I want to go with you. Oh, no you don't. You're going to stay right here. I'm going upstairs, and remember. No watching fires. Okay .. okay. It's like living in a jail around her. It's a wonder she even lets me breathe. Mister. Would you watch the place for me for a minute? See, I'm just a sucker for fires. - Sure. Sure, go right ahead. Thanks a lot. I'll be right back. Good evening, sir. - My name is Goff. I'm glad to meet you, Mr Goff. - Are you the chef here? Uhuh. - Nice, homey place you got here. Well, I'm glad you like it. Excuse me just one minute please. Jonah. Jonah. It's alright. She's gone. Is there anything I can ..? Oh, you shouldn't be eating them shrimp dry like that. They give you heartburn. Here. Try them with just a little bit of sauce. And just a spray of lemon. Tastes better, don't it? - Hmm. Much better. I saw your boat tied up at the pier. I was admiring it. Oh well. It ain't much of a boat. Just an old tub made with wood and spit. You own the boat? - I own half the boat. My friend Jonah Goodwin. The tailor next door. He owns the other half. You do a lot of fishing, don't you? - Uhuh. You like it? Ask me if I like to breathe. Ten hours a day I work in this place. Only the nights when I go fishing do I feel free. Then I'm a different man. I live in a different world. Out there on the bay with my friend Jonah. We get peace. We can get away from things. You see what I mean? - Sure. I see what you mean. Supposing somebody came around and said you can't go fishing anymore? That's silly. Why should anyone want to say a thing like that? Olaf. Aren't you ready yet? - Oh, I'm sorry. I was talking to my friend. This is Jonah Goodwin. He owns the other half of the boat. This is mister .. - My name is 'Goff'. Mr Goff. He's a nice fellow. He takes a personal interest in what we're doing. I'm glad you're both here. I must have a little talk with you. A little business talk regarding your boat. Our boat? Talk to us about our boat? What's to say about our boat? I'm ready, Jonah. Maybe you can put it off until another time? Tomorrow? You see, we're in a hurry now. Fire engines? It's nothing. Just a little fishing-boat caught fire at the end of the pier. Jonah. Maybe it's ours. - Don't worry, sport. It's not your boat. Mister. What makes you sure it's not our boat? - You can take my word for it. Wait a minute. You're here. The fire is down at the pier. How do you know? I just know. Come along, Olaf. - Yeah, I'm ready. Wait a minute, Jonah. It's cold out. Let me button your coat. Goodbye Mr Goff. I hope I have the pleasure of seeing you again. Don't worry, sport. You will. Hurry, Jonah. You know Caroline. Eddie. - Yeah? Here .. and don't forget. The next time you run off to a fire I'll fire you. I'll fire you. You understand? Always hollering. I wish she would fire me. 'Don't ring up the cash register. 'Don't do this'. Don't do that'. She don't holler at Olaf like that. The pushing-around I got to take for the dough I get. What did you say, Eddie? - Nothing. I didn't say nothing. By the way, George called. He'll be down in a few minutes. He ordered the usual. Hi everybody. How's business, Mr Propotkin? Terrible. Even the people who never pay, stopped buying. There you are. Gee, I'm glad you finally got here. I was worried about you. How do you feel? You look good. But then you always look good to me. Boy, did I have a swell day today. Sold off a lot of junk that was laying around the shop for years. Boy, was I in good form. I don't know why. I never had such bad luck in all my life. But then it's a pleasure to lose to a good sport like you. Put that back, Sam. Put what back? - That ace. What ace? That ace you're trying to deal yourself, you old gyp-artist you. You want to gyp, do it slick. Here, I'll show you. Put that ace back in the deck. Back in the deck? - That's right. Alright, now where's the ace? - In the pack. You're Sure? - Sure, sure. Keep your eye on the deck. I'll show you something. Now, keep your eye on the deck. Excuse me, lady. I'm just showing the boys a little trick. I was proving the hand is quicker than the eye. Go on eating. You don't mind if I use your boyfriend? It only takes a second. Where'd you say the ace was? In the deck. Wasn't it? - Sure. In the middle. Where I put it. No it ain't. It's in the inside pocket of this gentleman. Say, that's wonderful. I know how you did it. Can I have the deck a minute? I'll show you. - Go ahead. George. Leave him, lady. Don't let him suppress his natural talent. Take a card. Any card at all. Makes no difference to me. Alright. Put it back in the deck. Remember it now. - Yeah, we remember it, don't we? Is that it? - Uhuh. I guess I got that part of the trick wrong. Try it again. Take another card. Why not do something you can do rather than making a fool of yourself? Stop. There's lots of things he can do. You know it. Isn't there, Mr Propotkin. He was the best football player at Boy's High. First in his class. 'All-round George' they called him. - Stella. Now he's an auctioneer on the pier. He's a really talented man, but it only comes out when he makes a spiel. Come on, George. Show him. Show him with feeling. Stella, people are watching. Do you mind if my friend makes a speech? - No, go right ahead. It's a pleasure. Come on, George. Make the echoes ring on the pier. You know: 'what am I bid, what am I bid'? Stop it. I won't talk to you again unless you do this. Stella, please .. - Alright, I'll start for you. What am I bid? What am I bid? Who says 5 dollars, 3 dollars, a dollar? Fifty cents, ten cents. Who will say a dime? A genuine antique .. Stella. Hey Stella, what's wrong? Anything I've done? Anything I've said? No, it's not you George. Please believe that. It's just that I'm so fed up with things. Every day just like the other. Get up at 7. Rush to the phone company. 'Wrong number? Just a minute, please. I'll try them again'. Come home at night. Listen to mother nagging. Meet you at the grotto. Eat the same food, listen to the same corny jokes. I just can't take it any more George. I just can't take it. Don't you understand that? - Well, sure I do, but .. But I also know you'll feel different after we're married. I'll make you feel different. I swear that. You're such a good guy, George. But why do you pick on me? Because .. you're the girl for me. You're my kind of girl. But I'm not, George. Honest I'm not. - You are. I know from the bottom of my heart you are. You're a good, solid man, George. I'm not like that. You know what you want out of life. I don't. All you'll ever get from me is the pushing around. I know what I'm talking about, George. Please believe that. If you know what's best leave me alone. - I can't, Stella. I can't. - Why not? Because I love you. Hey, George. How do you like that? Here I am looking all over for you and you're making sweet words with a girl. A half-hour the boss gives you for supper. No more and no less. Alright. I'll be right there. Alright. I said I'd be right there. - Okay. I got to get back to the place. I'll be through in about an hour. Will you come by for me like you always do? Yes, George. I'll come by for you like I always do. That isn't such a bad fish, Jonah. A mosquito. Go home to your mother. Come back in two years. Off the coast of Cuba in the Gulf-Stream .. They catch fish that weigh from 700 to 1,000 pounds. Fish with spears in their noses. And it's warm there. The sun shines eleven months out of the year. Oh, it sounds like music. Like music from a band. You and me, we could be sitting in the middle of the Gulf-Stream right now. Wearing Panama hats and fishing for fish with spears in their noses. You and me and the Gulf-Stream. Olaf. - Yes, Jonah. Look. We could be on that boat, Olaf. Please, Jonah. It's torture. Jonah, Swenson wants $500 for that boat. Well, in the coffee-pot in your room we have $190. Am I right or wrong? - Right. But is $190 the same as $500? Haven't you heard of an instalment plan? - No thanks. In America, Olaf, every man can be a king on the instalment plan. I heard of it, you heard of it. But has Swenson heard of the instalment plan? Tomorrow he'll hear of it. Look, Olaf. Someday I'll die. God forbid. And they'll put on my grave: 'Here lies Jonah Goodwin. A good son, a good husband, a good citizen'. 'All his life he worked like a horse and never did the thing he wanted to do'. A little later, you'll die. They change some particulars but they will put the same thing on your grave. Jonah. - Yes? Caroline wants to marry me. - So? I ain't crazy to marry her. She reminds me of a woman in vaudeville that used to sing all promises. Then there's no problem. 'No Caroline'. You say: 'you don't click with me. You're not my type'. 'I like chorus girls with sweaters'. Yeah? Then she'll fire me. Or worse yet, she'll put on a sweater. You've never had to work for a boss who wanted to marry you. You've sure got a problem. Look, Olaf. Now it's December. January, February, March, April. Only four months. And springtime, Olaf. For once in our lives, a real spring. No tailor shop. No fish grotto. No Caroline. Let's buy it, Jonah. Let's buy it tomorrow. Stella. Hello, Stella. Hello, Pop. What are you doing on the pier alone? Nothing, nothing. How was the fishing, Pop? Not good, not bad. Medium. Come down here. I want to talk to you. - Okay, Pop. Remember. Not a word about our new boat. That's strictly a private secret until we have a bill of sale. Yeah. Yeah. Good evening, Stella. How are you tonight? Fine, Mr Johnson. And how is George tonight? That's right. Where's George? He had to work late. I'm going to meet him later. Say, Pop. You'd better hurry home. Mom's had another one of her attacks. Around this boat, Stella darling, we don't talk about your mother. Or about jobs or about money or about what we read in the newspapers. Here we just come four nights a week to fish .. And to be happy. Gee, Pop. I wish I had a boat four nights in a week. All I've got is .. George. That's no way to talk about a nice young man like George. I know Pop. Did you bring home a swordfish? 'Swordfish'. That's what they're called. With spears in their noses. 700 pounds. Oh, the ocean is a wonderful place. Swordfishes, octopuses. Wonderful. - Anyone got a cigarette? You know, it's not nice for young ladies to smoke outside of their own homes. Here. Look, Pop. Nine hours a day I'm a nice young lady. The smiling, cheerful voice of the telephone company. Friendly but virtuous. Never a wrong number. At night let me relax, Pop. Got a match? Sorry. It's okay. I'll get one down the pier. See you later, Pop. Anything wrong with Stella, Jonah? Oh no. She's just high-strung and nervous like all the other young girls. If you're looking for a light .. Thank you very much. I'll get a light down the pier. - That's alright, girl. Here you are. That's a nice perfume you use. Violet? - Well? Well, violet is a first-class smell. I like it. Well, I'm glad you like it. Thank you so much for the light. - My name is 'Goff'. I beg your pardon? - I repeat: my name is 'Goff'. Sorry. I never heard of you. You will soon. From coast to coast they'll hear of me. I can wait. - Just a minute. Excuse me. I really shouldn't be talking to a man I've never been formally introduced to. Look baby, you only live seventy years if you're lucky. We've no time for formal introductions. Especially women. How long do you think a woman has anyway? Fifteen years? You'll rot in Brooklyn your whole life .. Without meeting anyone but that boyfriend of yours. What's his name? And you're not the type to rot, sister. You must be a very successful man. You've got a successful attitude. You're alright. I knew when I first laid eyes on you. You've got class. You don't find that much in Brooklyn. Well, it doesn't do you much good in Brooklyn. Who'd have thought it? On a pier in the middle of winter, a girl like you. How do you know what kind of girl I am? - Oh, I can tell. There's a look in your eye. It sticks out all over you. Say. I've some to business to attend to. Say I meet you at the end of the pier in 15 minutes? It's been very pleasant to talk with you. But I've a date for tonight. - With Mr whatsisname? I beg your pardon, mister. But I said I've a previous engagement. Talk English, will you? What you think you're doing, writing a business letter? I think I'll be going now. Come on, I'll take you anywhere. The moon if you say the word. It's a holiday evening. A Saturday night in a mining town. Where to, sister? Good night. - I'll see you in 15 minutes. Don't bet on it. - I'll bet on it. Good evening, gentlemen. So that's your little tub, huh? Millions of gallons of water and he has to throw it in our boat. Yes? I'll make it short, boys. I'm the Admiral Dewey of Brooklyn. I protect Sheepshead Bay from pirates. We're not interested. We don't believe in pirates. I get $5 a week for protecting boats under thirty feet long from pirates .. Whether you believe in them or not. Go away Mr Goff. You see, Mr Goff. We've moored our boat here for three years and nothing ever happened to it. My fee is $5 a week. You get my special winter rate. Because you have a very pretty daughter. What do you know about my daughter? That's a nice boat you got there. Pretty name, too: 'Enterprise the 3rd'. I'd hate to see the Enterprise the 3rd at the bottom of the bay and .. Being used by the fish for their Rotary lunches. Go away, bluffer. Go away. Well, let's think it over. Sure, sure. Take plenty of time. I'll see you here tomorrow night. Nice to make your acquaintance, boys. We don't have to think about anything. Goodbye, chiseller. Look Pop, I ain't kidding. If you know what's good for you don't be stubborn. I'll call Magruder. Do that and you won't see that boat tomorrow night. Please Jonah, don't be a hero. Alright, Mr Goff. Come back tomorrow. I'll have you put in jail. Magruder! Magruder. Why did you call the cop? I told you not to do that. If you open your mouth to that flatfoot tomorrow there's no Enterprise the 3rd. Listen, Jonah. Every place you go you got to pay to be allowed to live. Who are we that we should fight with a man like that? We're two old men so we pay the $5 a week. Tell him, sport. - I beg you, what's $5 a week? What's up Jonah? What's the trouble? I have .. I have a sandwich left over, Magruder. A ham sandwich with rye bread. Why thanks, Jonah. You know, there's nothing better for a late snack. Now I have to pay for this fishing-rod. Good evening, Florence dear. Well, it's twelve midnight. How do you do, Mrs Goodwin? I hope you're feeling good tonight. I feel terrible, Mr Johnson. Hang it up, Jonah. Yes, dear. Maybe you'll be better soon, Mrs Goodwin. I doubt it. Are those fish, Mr Johnson? Yes. Four of them, Florence. - Well. Please don't place the fish in the middle of the living room, Mr Johnson. Oh, please forgive me. In the kitchen, please. Yes. Excuse me please. Is there anything wrong, Mrs Goodwin? Nothing. No, take it. - Thank you. Well .. I'm going to bed. Oh, I won't sleep. But I may as well lie down. Goodnight, Florence dear. Don't sound so happy to get rid of me. Please. Florence. Are you retiring for the night, Mrs Goodwin? Yes. Then, sleep well. How can I, Mr Johnson? When you brought half the Atlantic ocean into my living room. Florence, remember Mr Johnson is a guest in our house. The coffee is ready, Jonah. In the kitchen, Olaf. Stella. Yes, Pop? Stella. You weren't going to bed without saying goodnight to me, were you? I thought you were asleep. Why, you've color in your cheeks and your eyes are dancing. Hey Olaf, look. Look at how excited she looks. You must have had a wonderful time. You did, didn't you? Yes, Pop. I had a swell time. - Where's George? George? Why didn't you bring him in? - Well. He has to work for a living. He has got to get up early. Like me. Goodnight, Pop. Pleasant dreams. Goodnight Stella. Pleasant dreams. Well, I guess I'd better be going too. Alright Olaf. I'll walk to the door with you. Goodnight Jonah. And don't worry about Goff. Everything is going to be alright. Oh yes .. everything is going to be alright. Olaf, we're getting old. We must take a stand some place. Let's make a stand in our little boat before we're pushed off the earth. Jonah. - Not a cent. We won't give the hoodlum a cent. Alright, Olaf. I meet you tomorrow night at Caroline's as always. But remember, Olaf. Not a cent. Not one cent. Good evening, Mr Goodwin. I'm sorry to bother you but Stella promised to meet me at the store. I waited and waited but she never showed up. I felt something may be wrong. - No, nothing wrong. Stella wasn't feeling very well. She went to bed early. You sure it's nothing serious? - No, it's nothing at all. She'll be alright in the morning. Goodnight, George. Goodnight. Wait a minute, George. I'll walk down the street a way with you. Goodnight Jonah. You will pick me up tomorrow night at Caroline's? Yes, at Caroline's. Stella. [ Jonah's wife: ] Jonah. Jonah, come to bed. [ Jonah: ] Stella. Stella. I want to talk to you. [ Jonah's wife: ] 'Are you coming or aren't you'? Yes dear. I'm coming. I said I'm coming. I'm coming. Good evening, Mr Goodwin. - Good evening. You know, Jonah. I've been thinking about Goff. If he wants $5 a week for such a little boat like ours. How much would he charge for an ocean liner like the Leif Ericson? Well Olaf, we'll worry about a big boat when we get a big boat. I enquired this afternoon about putting the boat in Gravesend Bay. It would take us thirty more minutes to get to it but Mr Goff wouldn't be there. Let's put it in Gravesend Bay then. Why didn't you say it sooner? What are we worrying about? Well, in Gravesend Bay there operates a man who charges $7.50 a week. Goff won't come, Olaf. Wait and you'll see. It was all a bluff. He'll come .. he'll come. The man who collects money always comes. Good evening, sports. I'm glad to be dealing with a couple of punctual gentlemen. I told you, Jonah. The man who collects money always comes. What's the matter? Don't you recognize the Admiral of the Sheepshead Bay Navy? As a matter of fact, I should get a 17-gun salute. I'd like to give it to you point-blank. Jonah. Come on, Olaf. Please. Be nice to him. Now look, boys. We're here to conduct business. Let's conduct it friendly. Remember, we all got to live. - Get away from our boat. Come on, Pop, come on. Stop horsing around, will you. You'd better talk to your friend. - Jonah. Make believe he's a new tax. Who's he that we must pay him for space in God's ocean? Just a petty little grafter taking 5-dollar bills from small people. But not from me. For an old guy, you've got some cockeyed notions. He's joking. He's joking. Ain't you, Jonah? No, I'm not joking. Listen, you broken-down old jerk. Don't you hit my friend. Olaf. Olaf. Are you hurt? I've been hit harder, Jonah. I talk. And you get hit. I regret to do business this way. I like doing things on a friendly basis. What do you want? I've prepared a little paper. Just to keep everything legal. On this paper it says: 'Olaf Johnson and Jonah Goodwin'. 'Have received a loan of one thousand dollars'. 'At six percent interest'. 'And jointly pledge to pay the sum of $5 a week until the debt is paid off'. This is .. just for my file. But you didn't lend us anything. This note says I did. You sign here. But I'm a man who makes about $30 a week. And I support a wife who is always running to doctors. Doctor Goff is prescribing now. My fee is five dollars. Pay him, Jonah. - I'll make a deal with you. A deal? This is my deal. Clauses A, B, C and D. You'll never live to be an old man. Anyway, I won't starve to death. I'm in a hurry, boys. I got a date. Come on. Sign it. Right here. Now let's see how nice you can write. That's fine. Now, money boys? Olaf. Oh, here. I'll lend you fifty cents. Have a cigar. It's been a fine week. Twelve new customers. There's no telling where this corporation is going to go. Thank you very much. That don't worry me, Pop. Dime cigars. Well, I'll see you next week. Keep dry and I'll give your regards to your daughter. Olaf. - Yeah? What was it he said about my daughter? Is there anyone in here looking for me? - No, Miss Goodwin. Not that I know of. I'll have a chocolate soda. - Yes, ma'am. Right away. Here you are. Anything else? No, thank you. You shouldn't drink that. It spoils your taste for better things. Now, that's twice in a row I win my bet. How would you like to make another bet? This time I'll lay odds. Now, don't get sore. I'm glad you came. I was hoping you'd come. Now, where do we go tonight, huh? How about the moon? - Sure. Fine. Only we'll stop off at a couple of other places first, huh? I hit it. I hit it! For once in my life I beat the machine. 48,000. Pay me nine nickels. Keep your shirt on, you'll get paid off. Hello Stella. Hello Buddy. Let's get out of here. - Check. Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. - Wait a minute. What's your hurry? Oh violet perfume. Here, baby. Like the Ads say. My favorite smell. How much do I owe you? - That'll be $4.68 with the tax. There's exactly five dollars here. Keep the change. Let's go. Stella, must you play that radio again? Do you hear me? Shut it off. Alright Mom. What did you say? I said, 'Alright Mom'. [ Door knocks ] Who is it? It's me. Can I come in? Sure Pop, sure. Come in. I don't like to disturb you, Stella. Pop, will you unbutton me down the back? - Oh sure, sure. Stella. Remember the other night? You came home and said you'd been out with George. Yes, Pop. - You lied to me, didn't you? Yes I did. And all those other nights you lied. Didn't you? Yes, I've been lying to you. You've been going out with Goff. Haven't you? Yes, I've been going out with Goff. Stella .. have I ever interfered with your life? Oh no, Pop. You've been swell. Just a second. - But no. This Goff. Now I have to speak up. Stay away from him, Stella. Please stay away. He's a bad man. He's an exciting man, Pop. Why, he's been all over the country. New York, Chicago, Atlantic City. He's been in jail maybe. Those other places he saw in the movies. He's a disease. And it's a disease I want to catch. A disease that lets me sit in the subway in the morning .. And look at all the people around, and say to myself: 'I'm not like them'. I'm not like the people in the subway. I'm different. I've got something they haven't got. - What? Something, Pop. I don't know what, but something. Look Stella, you're my own daughter. And I'd like it better than anyone if you were extraordinary. But you're not. I don't love you any less for that, baby. There's nothing so terrible about being an ordinary person, Stella. Alright, so I'm ordinary. Okay. Well, ordinary or not, I will take my fling with Harold Goff. Why shouldn't I? - Listen, Stella. Do you .. do you know how Goff makes a living? He's a cheap racketeer. He takes money from poor people. Five dollars, three dollars. Anything he can get. If they don't pay, he beats them. How do you know? - I know. I don't believe it. And even if it's true, so what? That's the way world's made, Pop. The strong take from the weak. If it wasn't Goff it would be somebody else. I'm afraid he's done you some damage already. Say, Stella. Maybe. Maybe you need a vacation. A trip. You work too hard. - Pop, I got to get dressed. Yes. Yes, I'm sure that's what you need. Where would you like to go? What's the use of talking about it now? - Will it hurt to tell me? Alright .. I'd like to go to Cuba. I'd like to see the blue Caribbean and palm trees and natives dancing a rumba. I'd also like to fly like a bird and live in a penthouse with 25 servants. Oh please, Pop. I've got to get dressed. - Stella, listen to me. What do you say you take the next boat for Cuba, and stay three weeks? What do you say? Don't they use money in Cuba anymore? - You'll have the money. From where? - From me. A gift to my daughter who needs a vacation. Enough for a state room without bath. I'll fix it. Wait a minute, Pop. This will cost about $200. That's what I figured. Where can you get that much money? I have $190 saved for a special reason. You can have it. What's the matter? I've worked long enough to save that kind of money, haven't I? And you want to give it to me? Sure. Sure. Why not? Well? Are you going? It will be nice in the Gulf-Stream with the water blue and warm like a bath. The sun like butter. Oh, Pop. Pop. What are you crying about? A little travel information you can get from a booklet. And you cry. Stella. Oh Pop. Pop, I love you so much. But not enough to listen to me. Jonah .. Jonah .. Well, what's going on here? What's being kept from me? Why am I treated like a stranger in my own house, huh? [ Bell ] Pop, that's the store bell. - Yes, I'll see. Other daughters go to their mothers. Not once since you've been grown up have you ever come to me. Jonah. Jonah. Who came in? Good evening, partner. This is what I'd call a real cheerful dump. Like the mummy exhibit at the Brooklyn Museum. But each to his own taste. It's what makes the world go round. Where's Stella? Who'd have thought out of a hole like this you'd get a juicy girl like Stella? Where you going Pop, fishing? I'm going for a walk. - Why? Because I'm here? That's right. Listen, Goff. If you do anything to Stella .. This couch is hard enough to make a handball court. I mean it, Goff. Five dollars a week is one thing. My daughter is another. Evening, Mr Goodwin. Oh, hello kid. Welcome to our little castle. Stella upstairs? Yes, George. Go right ahead. Just a minute. Sit down. Relax. What's your hurry? Take it easy. Excuse me. - Do you like these? Orchids. Three bucks apiece for your girl, Stella. Imagine. Three bucks apiece for flowers that don't smell. Why not leave her alone? She's free, 21 and makes her own choice. - You're turning her head. You make her think she's important. You make her think you're important. You don't think so, do you? I asked you a question. You seem to be awful worried about my opinion, Mr Goff. George. Mr Goff .. I'm sorry. Look what comes out of the Brooklyn Telephone Company. You're lucky she came down, kid. I never hit a man with ladies present. Pop. Didn't you tell George I had a date tonight? Stella baby, what's come over you? I got something for you, Stella. Orchids. Three orchids. - I'm a fast man with a dollar. Stella, I've got to talk to you. Tomorrow George. I've got to go now. Goodnight, Pop. Goodnight, George. Goodnight, Pop. So long, kid. Practice up on your card tricks. Table, Mr Goff? - We'll sit at the bar. Hiya Joe. - What will you drink, Mr Goff? Don't sit there. I've got two good seats for you right over here. Follow me. - Let's go, baby. Alright boys, on your way. - Okay. What will you have, Mr Goff? - Two Zombies. Right. Good evening Mr Goff. How about it? - What have you got? Anything you want. Take your choice. - I'll take the Cuban doll tonight. Thanks. Thanks very much. - Oh, that's perfectly okay. Here you are. Keep the change. Thank you. Say, Joe. Who's the dame? She just started a few days ago, Mr Goff. A tasty dish. Right from Cuba. If you look close you can still see the baggage tags on her. Hiya, beautiful. Say, what's eating you, baby? - Nothing. Good-looking girl, ain't she? - Yeah. Everyone to their own taste. Sure. That's why I'm here with you. Nice place, huh? Uhuh. Very nice. Funny. You taking me to the Cuban room. - Why? Well, as a matter of fact .. - Yeah? Just hours ago, I was offered a trip to Cuba. By who? Your boyfriend? - No. Who? A man I know. - I said 'who'. You want to know? Baby. If I ask a question I want an answer. Who? You're hurting my arm. - Well? You don't have to get sore. It was my father. Your father? So, your old man offered you a trip to Cuba? Say, where would he get that dough? Well, he told me he had it saved up for a long time. $190. That's all he's got. Can you imagine? He wanted to give it to me because he felt I needed a change. Pretty wonderful. - You bet. You going? No. Of course not. Gee. I can't the take money he worked so hard to save, can I? So your old man's got 190 bucks and he's giving it to you? Yeah, wasn't it swell of him? - Very swell. He's a great guy alright. Let's drink to your old man. There's a special kick in those Zombies, Mr Goff. Better take it slow and easy. I like the music. Shall we? - Sure. You want to dance? Like Joe says, baby. Slow and easy. Goodnight .. I had a wonderful time. Come on. One last cigarette. It's almost daylight. Turn around and wait on the corner. Yes, sir. [ Ship's horn. Loud ] Sounds like a big one. An ocean liner. I wonder where it's going. - You do, huh? Why? Nothing .. I just wondered. You ever been away from Brooklyn? Yeah, once. I went to Buffalo to a funeral for an uncle. Listen .. about that trip you were talking about. You want to go with me? How can I? Mr Goff, what would I tell my mother? You can tell her we'll be married on the boat. Married. By the Captain? Yeah. With a brass band and flowers. How about it? I don't know. I don't even know if I'm in love with you. It's a 5-day trip to Cuba. You'll have plenty of time to find out. I must think this thing over carefully. Listen. If I thought things over carefully .. I'd be working a machine for 13 bucks a week. You get chances, you grab 'em. I turned from factory worker to bootlegger in eight minutes. But this will cost a lot of money. - That's my department. You know .. I heard that .. That is .. they say you're a racketeer. You make your living taking money from poor people. That you beat them up. - Who told you that? Your father? What else did he say? - That's all. Well .. it's true. I may as well tell you the rest so we can start from scratch. You know who one of my customers is? Your father. Goodbye, Mr Goff. Goodbye, Miss Goodwin. How can you be so hard? What have you got inside of you? - I've got education inside of me, baby. The education I got on the breadlines, pool-rooms, and bar-rooms of big cities. I got rocks inside me, baby. It would have been a nice trip. Well .. Maybe another uncle of yours will die in Jersey City. George. What are you doing here? I've been outside. Waiting for you to come home. I don't want you spying on me. - I have to talk to you. There's nothing to talk about, George. - There's our whole life to talk about. Yours, not mine. - And yours too. Look, George. It's 5 o'clock in the morning. I must be up at seven to go to work. I've got to get some sleep. Do you say that to Goff too? George. - Or to me before you met him? Shall I remind you of the times we stayed out all hours of the morning? How many times I took you straight to work. You weren't worried about sleep then, were you? George, you're waking everyone up in the house. Tonight .. we'll talk about it tonight. I'll see you tonight, George. I promise I will. Oh no. No. It must be now. Look George. I know what you will say. You want me to marry you. Yes. To live in a 3-room flat with you? - Yes. To have children. To spend all day cooking and washing diapers. Yes. - Why should I? Why should I? Because I know you can be happy living that kind of life with me. Look, Stella. I'm not talking off the cuff. George. Please go home, will you. I cannot see a guy like Goff break your heart. What for? It's so easy for you to be happy. Yeah, even in a 3-room flat. We can live a beautiful lifestyle. George, go home will you. Just doing the simple things. Taking a walk on a boardwalk on a Sunday afternoon. Watching the people in the ocean. I can get a real kick out of just watching you just put on a new dress. It's inside of you, Stella. With your heart spilling over with love for the things you've got. That you can hold on to forever. That's where you find what you're looking for. Not with Goff and his phoney kind of life. Inside of you, Stella. With me. It's the way I feel about things. Why did you have to come here? Why did you have to spoil everything now? Eddie. Eddie, Eddie! - Yeah? Where's Olaf? Can't you hear me? Where's Olaf? - Where do you expect him to be? Did you tell him? - Certainly I told him. I said in plain English. I said: tonight is Caroline's birthday party. Tonight she don't want you to go fishing and tonight she wants you to be here. What did he say? - He said he'd be here. You stay here. If anybody comes .. I'll be right back. Olaf. Olaf. Olaf. Olaf! That's funny. The boat is here. Olaf. Where are you? Olaf. Olaf! She must be a very athletic woman to run so fast with all those corsets on. All she needs is a letter on the sweater she is wearing. She's thirty-seven today. She wants me to go to her birthday party. Her thirty-seventh birthday. So she says. - Thirty-seven? She's fifteen minutes younger than the Roman Empire. Let's go. Oh. I forgot to ask you. What happened with Swenson? Good news. He'll take the $190 and allow us $100 on the Enterprise the 3rd. And the rest we pay in instalments. Olaf. I feel that Gulf-Stream sun right now. Like warm butter. Oh, Jonah .. look. Men of the Enterprise the 3rd. I salute you. We're pleased to see you. - I'm pleased to see you. We've got some business to transact. I've come for the small sum of one hundred and ninety bucks. What did you say? - I repeat. I came for the small sum of one hundred and ninety dollars. Somebody's been telling you fairy-stories. Where can two old men like us get $190? I want that money tomorrow night. I don't know what you're talking about. I'll sink the Enterprise the 3rd to the bottom of the bay and then you'll know. Please, Mr Goff. Ain't you got any feelings inside you? Don't talk foolish. I got rocks inside me. What's the use, Jonah? Why should we fight any more? Let's sell the Enterprise the 3rd. Forget the Leif Ericsson. Forget fishing and .. Forget Mr Goff. You can't sell your hide, brother. Tomorrow night at 9 o'clock. One hundred and ninety smackers. Magruder. Magruder! Don't call him. I tell you, leave the cops out of this. Police .. police! Magruder. One thing I'm serious about. I don't like to appear in court. Help! Magruder. Jonah, he'll kill us. Magruder. Police. Jonah, not so loud or Magruder will come. Magruder! Okay. Don't say I didn't warn you. Jonah, maybe we can make a deal. - No. No. No more deals. First it's $5, now it's $190. Next it will be the food we eat and then the roof over our heads. Magruder .. Magruder! What's the matter? What's going on down here? Magruder. This man here is a racketeer. He extorts money from us. Two crazy old men. - A gangster. He wants 190 dollars. He'll get 190 years. We want him arrested. You too, Olaf? Well .. Olaf. Yes. I want him arrested too. Boys, I've been waiting for this for a long time. Come on, you tinhorn Dillinger. You boys will have to come along and press the charge. Yes, yes. That's it, Magruder. We'll be right along. Olaf. We should have done it a long time ago. Too simple. There must be something wrong. Come on. I accuse Goff of being a racketeer and I want him put on trial. Very well. What do you say for yourself, Mr Goff? I'm afraid these two old boys are trying to pull a fast one, Your Honor. Tell the truth, you crook. Order. Preserve the dignity of the court. Continue, Mr Goff. In the course of my business on the evening of December 7th this year. I had the occasion to advance as a loan to Mr Goodwin and Mr Johnson. The sum of $1,000. You liar. You'll be struck dead by God. Order. All decisions in this court will be made by me. Continue, Mr Goff. This $1,000 loan at 6% interest per annum, payable at the rate of $5 a week. Was secured by a personal note signed by these two old men. Here is the note .. notarized. Yes, notarized. December 7th. $1,000 payable to .. Why, this seems perfectly regular to me. But we signed it at the point of a gun. He didn't lend us a penny. The note is a lie, Judge. I swear it. One at a time please. Now, did you sign this paper? Yes, but .. - And you? Yes, I signed it. Notarized. These two gentlemen have invented their little plan to avoid paying their debt. That's the whole story. I'm unpleasantly surprised .. That two men of your age should attempt an adventure like this. But you are wrong. You're so wrong. The court rules there are no grounds for further litigation. If you Mr Goff, wish to bring charges of false arrest. You're at liberty to do so. But, Your Honor. You cannot do this. I know these men. I'll vouch for .. Silence. And next time don't make arrests on such ridiculous evidence. And take up the time of the court. Get back to your beat .. case dismissed. Next case. Tony Badiccio. Wife beating. Alright. Let's go. Yes .. yes. Now, I have to go to Caroline's birthday party. Olaf. - Yes? Maybe you ought to marry her. She cannot be any worse than Goff. Yeah? Well .. Get a good night's rest, Jonah. Tomorrow we go fishing. Goodnight, Jonah. Tomorrow we go fishing. Goodnight Olaf. Hello, Pop. It took you a long time to get home. What do you want now? I'm going to teach you a lesson, Pop. Purely for business reasons. Understand? You see that? That's rubber hose. You can beat a man to death with rubber hose. And it hardly leaves a mark on them for their wives to complain about. I see. I got nothing against you personally. But the next time any of my clients decide they may want to kick up a fuss. They'll see what happened to you. Yes. Purely a business measure. I'm glad you see it that way. One yell out of you and it will be your last. Remember that. Go ahead .. go ahead. That'll be enough. Because you're an old man. Now, no more funny business about the 190 bucks. Look at me when I talk to you. I'll be here tomorrow night at nine to collect. Well. Why don't you say something, Pop? Go ahead, say it. Say what you'd like to do to me. Go on, talk. Talk it out. You're all alike. Scared. Scared of your own shadow. That's why I get away with things like this. Because I know that. If you did to me what I'm doing to you, do you know what I'd do? I'd kill you. Yeah, I'd kill you. But you'd never have the nerve to do that. Here. It's easy. Go on. Take it. Take it. All you do is pull that little trigger and there's no more Goff. Go ahead, Pop. Go ahead. What's the matter? Can't you do it? Remember, Pop. Tomorrow night. 9 o'clock. One hundred and ninety smackers. Pop. The door was open. I thought I'd come in. What's the matter with you, Pop? You don't look well. I don't look well? Oh, I'm fine. Fine. You're up late, aren't you? Yeah. I've got some things to do. - Oh. You have got some things to do. What are you doing? Going away? Where? I am .. I'm going to Cuba, Pop. Cuba? Yes. I'm going with Harold Goff. When? The day after tomorrow at midnight. Stella. Stella, is there anything I can do .. or say to stop you? No, nothing, Pop. It's all been said. I can't help it, Pop. To get what you're after in this world .. You've got to be hard and tough inside, like Goff. What? - Yes. Not caring what happens to anyone else or what you do to them. Like Goff. I'm sorry, Pop. That's the best you'll ever get out of anything. His talking. 'You're all alike. Scared'. 'Scared of your own shadows'. 'That's how I get away with things'. Pop. What are you saying? What are you talking about? - Yes, Stella. Maybe you're right. Maybe that's the way to be. Like Goff. Take a man like me, like Olaf. All our lives we're peaceful men. We don't want to hurt anyone. We don't want anyone to hurt us. But they keep pushing us. Pushing. Pop, I've never heard you talk this way before. I've never felt this way before. Stella, dear. For the last time, I beg you. Don't go with him. For your sake, for my sake. Oh Pop, it's no use. You must love him very much. All I know is Pop, is .. When he talks I feel like I'm burning. When he takes my arm as we go past a cop in the street. I know someday that cop may shoot him. He knows it, too. And even so, he laughs. And then I get hot and cold all over and I feel like yelling. Nothing that ever happened to me before made me feel like this. Pop. What's the matter with you? Nothing. Nothing. Goodnight baby. Goodnight, Pop. Pop .. aren't you going to bed? Bed? No, I'm not going to bed. Well, where are you going? Well, I .. I've a headache and I need a little fresh air. I'm going for a walk. You lose again, Bublitchki. Hello Mr Goodwin. - Hello Jonah. What brings you here? I've got a pain in my back. - You've come to the right place. Steam is good for everything. I'll see you alright Mr Goodwin. Bublitchki. Bublitchki. Come back soon, Bublitchki. I'm going to miss you. [ Singing ] Bublitchki, Bublitchki. What do you want? Hit me on the neck, but hard. Harder. Ah, that's good. Thank you Bublitchki. What's more peaceful than a Russian bath at 2 o'clock in the morning? Tomorrow. Tomorrow the creditors come and hold an auction in front of my dry goods store. On Pitkin Avenue for sixteen years. A bankrupt. I Propotkin, a bankrupt. A man who once had $12,000 in the bank. The more I sweat, the more I forget. Sweat is my only happiness. Here is your towel, Mr Goodwin. - Thank you. Are you sure you haven't seen Mr Johnson? A little man. Speaks with kind of an accent. Young, more or less. I'm sorry. I not see him. - Thank you. Well .. the bankrupt becomes one. I sweat and the profit system comes right out of my pores. They push you. They push you. They take everything from you. They strip you naked. Naked as a mule. And what do you do? Yes, yes. What do you do? Did I ask you? No. - Then don't answer. Oh, it's you. I didn't recognise you. Bublitchki .. Bublitchki. Alright, alright. What do you want now? Give me a rub, but first hit me on the neck again. And this time make it really hard. Okay, don't you worry. It will be hard. Okay, okay. That's enough. That's enough. Thanks very much, Bublitchki. How is business at the store, Mr Propotkin? Business at the store? I'm no longer the owner of Propotkin's Dry Goods Store. They tell me my books don't balance. For me they balance, but for them they don't. So I'm a bankrupt. Always, they thought I was joking when I told them I didn't make any money. Finally, it turns out I am losing money. Even I am surprised. I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. For sixteen years I was an institution on Sheepshead Bay. Yes. Yes, come and go. I'm the victim of people who don't understand my accounts. Just because I kept them in my own way. Everybody has a different taste in clothes. Why can't I have a different taste in bookkeeping? Sixteen years it takes them to find out I cannot add or subtract. A situation like this can make a man like me an anarchist. Please don't repeat that. - Around now. What a life. Olaf .. Olaf. Over here. - Yes, Jonah. Sit down. I came as soon as you called. Caroline is ready to fire me. Why the rush, Jonah? We have a decision to make tonight, Olaf. A great decision. All night long, I've been faced with great decisions. First Caroline, then with George and then this. It's too bad it all had to happen in one night. Misery grows like a boil. At first, a little red spot. Then, all at once tragedy. Pardon me, this is a private conversation. I'm not listening to you. I've got enough troubles of my own. Rub Bublitchki. Rub. Why you in the Russian Bath all of a sudden, Jonah? After you left me tonight Olaf. Goff caught me. He hit me with a rubber hose. It's a little hard to move now. Harder. Harder, harder, I said. Shake the brains well. That's terrible. But what can we do? If you lived in the jungle. And a tiger stole your food. And ran off with your children. What would you do? I don't know. You would kill him. The modern man has a size 12 foot. With a size 8 shoe. Massage the spine, please. Did I .. Did I hear right what you said, Jonah? Yes, Olaf .. you did. Did I understand you? I think you did, Olaf. But we ain't living any younger, Jonah. Yes Olaf, we are. We're two old men. - Yes. Two old men. You and me. Listen. I have a plan. - Oh. You have a plan already? All men are created free and equal so it says in the books. Who am I equal to? Nobody. Throw away the books. All my life I wanted peace and gentleness. Violence? Leave it to men like Goff. All my life, I too Olaf have wanted peace and gentleness. But can you convince airplanes and bombs .. And men with guns in their pockets? What's your plan? You will go through with it? I will. I will go through with it. It's a little bit hot in here, isn't it? Naked I came into the world. Naked I will go out of the world. The Pitkin Company will have my clothes. Rub hard Bublitchki. Rub harder. Harder. Yes? Tomorrow night he'll come for his money. We'll pay him. But you said .. - We pay him. He'll be in good spirits. We'll make believe we're in good spirits too. We'll take the cigars he gives us. I always take them anyway. Cigars don't grow on trees. We'll talk to him friendly-like. We'll say Stella wants him to call for her. We'll say she's at a friend's house over in Manhattan Beach. At a linen shower. - Sure. Then, one of us will say: 'Come in our boat, Mr Goff. We'll take you to Sheepshead Bay'. 'Where we dock is only five blocks away from where Stella is tonight'. 'It's a nice night, Mr Goff. The air will do you good'. 'Your complexion is ..' Ah .. naked. Naked as a mule. A bankrupt. So .. he has to get in the boat? - That's right. And what happens after he gets in the boat? We start across the bay. - Yes .. and .. We go far out and when we're in the middle, all of a sudden .. The motor will break down. Excuse me. I'm thirsty again. Say, he's a fine-looking man. He has kept his figure. We all eat too much. Teeth. If we didn't have teeth we would be better off. I'm surprised the Pitkin Company left me my teeth. Yes. Olaf .. Olaf. You said 'the motor has broken down'. 'Look' somebody says: 'The boat's stopped. It's the motor'. 'Mr Goff .. would you please hold the rudder down while I inspect it'? So he goes to the back of the boat and he leans over .. And one of us will say: 'I think it's the carburettor float'. That's the signal: 'I think it's the carburettor float'. The other comes from the back of the boat. And? Hits him over the head. - What? I said: 'Hits him over the head'. Oh. No. That's the sweat. You drink and it comes out. It's an endless circle. Jonah, he's a very powerful-looking man. Yes .. he has arms like a circus strongman. You know, it would be nice if we could give him fifty cents and let him do it. Yes, it would be nice but it can't be arranged. One of us has to do it. One of us. Yes. Well, which one? You or me? Well, are you all finished with your private conversation? I'm in the mood for talking now. If you have no objections. In a little while, thank you. In a little while. Sweat and discussion. It's like champagne to me. That's all the Pitkin Company has left to me: sweat and discussion. Alright. Let's .. let's toss a coin. Yes. Bublitchki. Give me a coin please. - What do you want a coin for? Come on. How far can we run with it dressed like this? Here .. a quarter. Look .. somebody still has a quarter. A quarter. Most people think a quarter is nothing. For a quarter the Pitkin Company would dump you in the ocean. In front of your wife and children. For another quarter they'd push them in. No. You toss the coin. Olaf, please .. let me do it. You're a grown man but somehow you've kept the soul of a baby. I'm different. I'm old, Olaf. Old through-and-through. And this is an old-man's job. Toss the coin please. Heads. Heads. It's 9 o'clock. - Yes, I know. I know. Maybe he won't come. Maybe he changed his mind. He'll come. You haven't changed your mind, have you? Who me? No. I think it's the carburettor float. Good evening boys. Hello Mr Magruder. Glad to see you. - How's the world treating you? We've no complaints. Well, you can consider yourselves lucky men then. We do. The night of the new moon. A fit night for sin and corruption. Or fishing. Well, what's so funny about that? Nothing. You know Olaf. Sometimes he laughs. Say I must be getting on. Got a long beat to cover. Goodnight, boys. - Goodnight, Mr Magruder. Goodnight. Good evening, Captain. See. I've promoted you, Magruder. If you are nice I'll make an Inspector of you. Oh boys. Boys. - Yes? If you need me I'll be right around the corner. Thanks, thanks. - Goodnight Mr Magruder. Goodnight Captain .. and .. Don't pound that beat too hard. Hello boys, I'm sorry I'm late. Well, that's alright. We didn't mind waiting. I don't like to rush but I'm in a hurry. Come on. A hundred and ninety smackers. A hundred and ninety smackers, Jonah. Mr Goff is waiting for it. Oh. Yes, that's right. Here you are, Mr Goff. It's all there. I'll count it. We counted it many times. One hundred and ninety, gentlemen. We saved for three years. Everybody should save for the future. You can start all over again. Just save your pennies. Right in the old wallet. It's a nice article, that wallet. Ostrich. Genuine ostrich. Cost me 23 dollars. Imagine that. A bum off the brake-rods with an ostrich wallet. How do you like that? How do you like it? Here. Have a cigar. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr Goff. I see you're smoking my cigars now, Pop. You changed your mind. - Yes. I changed my mind about a lot of things. Here, have a light. That's the way I like to hear you talk. Well, so long boys. I'm off to meet your dark-eyed, willowy daughter. Oh I forgot. Just a moment, Mr Goff. I've a message for you from her. - Well, what is it? She's at a linen-shower over at Manhattan Beach. 305 Exeter Street. She wants you to call for her there at 10 o'clock. 10 o'clock, huh? - If you like .. We can take you over in our boat. Say, thanks. That's the kind of business partners I like. It's nice of you boys, but I'll take a taxi. It's a nice night, Mr Goff. It's a million-dollar night. There's no doubt about it. The breeze is fine for your complexion. Your color ain't so good. Huh? That's the truth. I look as if I came out of a jug, don't I? How long will it take? - Twenty minutes at the most. Or much less. Okay. Goff is in the mood for a boat ride. Lead the way, Admiral. Hey! Well, well. Look who's here. - George. Mr Goodwin, I must speak to this fellow. - What's on your mind, kid? Not now George, We'll talk later. We're in a hurry. Come, Mr Goff. We got to take Mr Goff someplace. Don't we, Mr Goff. Just a second, boys. This will only take a few minutes. What's eating you, kid? I hear you're taking Stella to Cuba. It's alright George. Everything will be alright. Now don't worry. Yes. Why not see us tomorrow? Same time, same place. This cannot wait until tomorrow. - It can't. You're right. I am taking Stella to Cuba. What you going to do about it? I'm going to stop you. - Yeah? How? George. George. - He's hurt bad. Nah, he'll be alright. Next time the dope will check out if he sticks his nose in other men's affairs. Come on, Pop. It's getting late. Get some water, Olaf. - No, it's alright. That's right, George. That's good. Please don't worry. Come on, boys. It's getting late. Please, Mr Goff. Can't you see he's hurt? Okay, I'll take a taxi. - No, no. No, Mr Goff. It's alright. Look, we'll take you right now. On our boat. Come on Mr Goff. It's right here. It will take no time at all. Yeah, we'll take you. - Yes. Ah, this is the life. Like I always said, Pop. There are superior people, and there are inferior people. No harm meant, Pop. - No harm done. Superior people make the inferior people work for them. That's a law of nature. If there's trouble, you beat them up a few times and there's no more trouble. Then you have peace. - I see. Ah, I can feel the color coming into my cheeks. Hey. What's the matter? We're stopping. The motor. There's something wrong with the motor. It happens once in a while. - Listen, I got a date at 10 o'clock. I must have holes in my head to sail this jalopy. I should have got a taxi. Compose yourself, Mr Goff. Say, listen. I can't swim. - It's alright. You won't have to swim. Would you be so kind as to give me some assistance, Mr Goff? Okay. These gloves cost 6 bucks. I don't like to get them dirty. You won't get them dirty. Say, listen. This boat is rocking. Is it alright for it to rock like this? She's perfectly safe. Steady, old jalopy. Come on, let's get going. What you need me to do? Would you please hold that, Mr Goff. - This? Yes .. I think .. I think it's the carburettor float. Okay. Who you saying it to? Someone on Staten Island? Hold that, Mr Goff. - The light too? Yes. An outboard motor. A man has to be crazy to go sailing in an outboard motorboat. Snap it up, Goodwin. I think, I think .. it's .. The carburettor float. What do you expect me to do about it? Nothing. I'm just telling you, Mr Goff. Well hurry then. Don't expect me to stay here all night. I think it's the carburettor float. Okay, it's the carburettor float. Fix it. You know, Goff. There's a lot in what you say of being superior or inferior. You bet. Can the gab. Get this cracker-box going, will you. I think it's the carburettor float. What the devil you doing? Memorizing that? You think it's the carburettor float. Okay. I think it's the carburettor float. Okay. Now, do something about it. It ain't safe to be standing in this egg-crate. Look how it's rocking. Here, let Johnson hold on to this thing. Why, you dirty double-crossing .. So you two old guys thought you would pull a fast one? And knock me off, huh? Sorry, Jonah. I couldn't do it. Alright, Olaf. Neither could I. - Well, I can. Jonah. In the book, it says a man comes up three times. Maybe Goff didn't read the book. - Maybe. Once Mr Goff said he had rocks inside him. I guess Goff was right when he said he couldn't swim. Olaf. - Yes, Jonah? We didn't have to do it. That's right. We didn't have to do it. 'And The Lord shall cause Thine enemies who rise up against Thee ..' 'To be smitten before Thy face'. That's from the bible, Olaf. Thanks, God. For stepping in. Here's your bundle, Pop. I'll pick up the returns on the way back. Okay. Hi, Mr Goodwin. - Good evening. Oh, good evening Mr Goodwin. - Good evening, Joe. Is that the latest edition? - Yeah. Just hot off the press. Can I have one please? - Why sure, Mr Goodwin. What happened to you? You rarely bought a paper and now you're taking them all. You haven't started playing the horses, have you? No. Here is your money. Come on, Olaf. Please Jonah, may I look at it? Maybe I can find it. No, never mind. I can look. Well Jonah, anything in it? - Not a thing. Not a word. Maybe they wouldn't print it in the paper. After all, he was only a gangster. Who else's names do you find in the papers? You know, I'm still worried. How long can the ocean hide a man, Jonah? It can hide him until the last fish is caught. But already it's three days and not a word from Mr Goff. What do you want him to do, send you a telegram? Stella. Why doesn't your father answer that bell? Well, it's a few minutes past eight. He's probably gone fishing with Olaf. I'll answer it, Mom. Are you Stella Goodwin? Yes. What do you want? - You'd better come along with us. Here we are. Go right ahead, folks. What's the matter? Saving the lights? Take it easy. Is it my fault they put the switch at the other end of the room? Well, maybe they're afraid the light will hurt their eyes. Come, Miss Goodwin. - Where you taking me? So the young lady wants to see her sweetheart? Well, it's easy. We'll show him to her. - Please. Come on. Don't be scared. They can't bite you. Here we are. Go right on in. No. Don't, please. Try to pull yourself together. You've got to help us. Here he is. Right here on the little shelf. Is that him, lady? - I don't want to look. Come on, lady. Is that him? - Please, please. Don't make me look. Come on. Speak up. Is that him or isn't it? Take a good look, lady. This is where they all wind up. All of them. - Yes, that's him. Lady, I can't hear you. Yes or no? Yes, yes. That's him. How about a statement, lady? Did you love him? Were you mixed up in the racket, lady? How old are you? Miss Goodwin, did you know Goff was wanted by police in 5 other cities? No, I didn't. I thought you were Goff's girlfriend. Yes, I was his girlfriend. When did you see him last? Several days ago. I had a date with him. He didn't show up. Wouldn't it have been better if you'd notified the police? He wasn't the kind of man you notified the police about. In here. You know this man? Yes. What are you holding him for? What's he got to do with it? - Now take it easy, Miss. Sit down, young man. I said, sit down. When we found the body, there were two tickets for Cuba in his inside pocket. What do you know about that? Yes, I was going to Cuba with him the next evening. Did you know that? Yes, I knew that. - When did you find out about that? Three days ago. - What did you do about it? I went to the pier that night to meet Goff. And what happened? - We had a fight. George. - What about? I told him I didn't want him to take her to Cuba with him. He's no good for her. I wanted him to leave her alone. How did you feel about it? Sit down, young man. I asked how you felt about it. What's that got to do with it now? - A lot. A week ago, your father and a Mr Johnson tried to get him arrested for extortion. Did you know about that? Yes, I knew about it. You must have been pretty crazy about him to want to go away with him .. After he pulled a stunt like that on your father. You were pretty much impressed with Goff, weren't you? Answer me. Yes. Impressed. You thought he was a pretty big-shot, didn't you? Please. I guess he didn't look like much of a big-shot lying there in the morgue. Please, don't. Just a stiff with a number. No different to other petty gangsters. No, Don't. Please don't. - Why put her through this? She doesn't. If you tell me the truth. - I've told you the truth. Not all of it. I want the whole story from beginning to end. You were in love with her, weren't you? I still am. Yet you knew she was crazy about Goff. You admitted fighting with him on the pier. What did you intend doing about it after that? Nothing. I knew afterwards it was no way to stop her. She'd just have to get over him. That's all. It may have taken a long time. I was willing to wait. It would be possible wouldn't it, that you got a little impatient? Met Goff at the wharf and .. Would that be possible? - No, it wouldn't be. Not George. Well, you don't know him the way I do. If he said he was willing to wait until I got over this, he'd wait because .. Well .. that's the kind of guy he is. Yes. I kind-of think so, too. Not a single fish tonight, Jonah. No. I suppose it's because our minds aren't on it. I suppose so. - How can you think of fish when .. When what? - Oh nothing. Only maybe .. Maybe what? Maybe the morning paper is out. Maybe. I lost my pipe. I can't find it. Come on, Olaf. Tie it fast. - Jonah. Yes? Look. I think Mr Goff left something behind. Jonah, please. Throw it in the ocean. Quick. With all our money in it? Oh no. Alright, take out our money but throw the wallet after Mr Goff. Hold the light. I'll count it. Uhuh .. it's all there. A hundred and ninety. Please Jonah, throw it overboard. - Wait. We paid him $5 a week for five weeks didn't we? Yes, five weeks. - Alright. Five, ten, fifteen, twenty. Twenty-five. It's just like saving money in the bank. Jonah. Overboard please. Why should we throw all that money away? Olaf, all over the world little children haven't got enough to eat. Well, maybe it wouldn't be wrong to keep the rest of Mr Goff's money and .. Donate it to charity. - Some worthwhile charity. For children, say. - Yeah, for children. Alright, take all the money, Jonah. But throw away the wallet. It's a shame to throw a wallet like that into the ocean. A 23-dollar wallet. No. A small return for all the misery he gave us. [ Police siren ] Jonah, look. What's that? A car. Officer. - Sir? Do you know Jonah Goodwin and Olaf Johnson? Sure I know them. - Seen them round here? Sure I saw them. They went fishing a few hours ago. They should be back by now. There they are. Oh, Miss Goodwin. Is that your father? Yes, that's my father. - Alright, come on. Let's go. Jonah. The wallet. It's the police. They're coming after us. They found out. I can see the electric chair. I can feel it. Olaf. Calm yourself. What are we standing here for? Let's go someplace. Maybe we can run away. Hey you! Stay where you are. It will be alright, Stella. Don't worry. Not a word, Olaf. Not a word, do you hear? Let me handle everything. Which one of you is Jonah Goodwin? - I am. Hello Stella, George. What's the meaning of this? It's alright boys. This is just a routine check. I'll talk for myself. I can vouch for these two parties. I've known them for years. They don't need anybody to vouch for them if they've done nothing. Do you know anything about a Mr Goff? - No. Yes. - A little. His body was found in the bay. - Is that so? A wallet was missing from the body. An ostrich-leather wallet. Do you know anything about it? What's the matter with him? - Hit me on the back hard, Jonah. It's my nose. You see, in the winter it runs and trickles down my throat. You know. Yeah I know. I've got to search you men. - Go right ahead. No. I'll be first if you don't mind. Alright, you can be first. What are you laughing about? - I'm ticklish. I'm sorry. Oh alright .. now you. Turn around. Wait a minute. You don't have to do that. Lady, will you please stand back and allow me to do my duty. It's alright, Stella. - I'd suspect my own father first. That's why you still pound the beat. The Inspector is only doing his duty. Go ahead, Inspector. Jonah. I feel kind-of sick. Well, what's this? Worms. Bait. For crying out loud. - Is that all? Yes, that's all. - What did I tell you? Public enemies? Go back to your fish, boys. The G-Man is through. Button your lip. I'm your superior officer and the law is the law. Come on, Jack. If you're going home Stella and don't mind, I'd like walk along with you. Alright, George. Oh Pop, I can't, I can't. Well .. I guess I'd better be getting back to the shop. Got a new shipment of genuine antiques. Going my way, Magruder? I'll walk to the end of the pier with you. I have a job to do too. That's swell. Stella is kind-of a moody girl. She'll be alright, won't she Mr Goodwin? - Oh sure. Goodnight. Goodnight, Stella. Goodnight. - Goodnight, George. Goodnight, Mr Magruder. Goodnight. - Stella, baby. Oh Pop, I've made such a mess of things. Such a horrible mess. That's it baby, cry. Cry. It will do your heart good. It will wash the hurt away. Pop, tell me it never happened. Please tell me. - It happened, Stella. It happened. Oh no. It was a dream, I know it was. And when I wake up .. The dream will be over. There will be nothing. Everything will be like before. Before Goff. - I don't know if it will be, Pop. Without you to turn to I don't know what I'd do. Don't talk that way, Stella. You'll be alright without me too. No I wouldn't. You're the only one, Pop. And I've hurt you so much, haven't I? I'll never hurt you again, ever. I'm so lucky to have you. So grateful. What is there so wonderful about me? I'm just an ordinary person like .. Like everybody else around here. Like Olaf, like George, like Magruder. Yes, Stella. Your father is just an ordinary man. And his daughter? She's an ordinary woman. But there's one thing ordinary people can do just as good as anybody. They can love each other like .. Like millionaires or poets. That's why it isn't such a terrible thing to be an ordinary person, Stella. Here .. have a cigarette. Gee, Pop. That's the first time you ever offered me a cigarette. Well, we all make mistakes. Olaf. - Yes? Will you take care of the boat tonight? I'm walking home with my daughter. Please, Jonah. Before you go there's something I have to talk over with you. Go ahead, say it. - No, Jonah. Alone. I must talk to you alone. Excuse me, Stella. It's alright, Mr Johnson. I'll wait for you on the pier, Pop. - I'll be right there, Stella. Well, Olaf? Jonah, before I die .. the wallet. Where is the wallet? In the water. - The money? In the wallet .. watch me. Too good to be true. The boat with the bunks in the galley, the swordfishes in the Gulf-Stream. We'll have it all now. - Jonah. Our safety deposit box. - Our bank president. A man with the brains of a bank president. That's what you are. Now Jonah. Please. Will you throw away the wallet. For your sake, Olaf. Make a wish as you throw it, Jonah. And while you throw that old hunk of bait away make a wish for me. See you later, boys. Too bad. It was a nice piece of leather. Goodnight, Olaf. - Goodnight, Jonah. A man with the brains of a bank president. Stella. - Yes, Pop? For a long time Mr Johnson and I wanted to buy a boat and go fishing off Cuba. I think now, we can buy that boat. And it would be nice if we had somebody like you along. Somebody to do the cooking and help along. Would you go on such a trip if I asked you? Would I? Oh, Pop. Just ask me. You'll find out. You know Stella, off the coast of Cuba the sun shines 11 months of the year. And they catch fish that weigh from 700 to 1,000 pounds. Fish with spears in their noses. Swordfish, Pop. They call them 'swordfish'. That's it, Stella. Swordfish. ..r-o..
