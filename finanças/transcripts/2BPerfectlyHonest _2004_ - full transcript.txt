(metal chimes) - I understand. I understand. I understand. Absolutely. What? Is he an expert? Well, then, Mr. Abrams, why should we have to... You didn't have these questions two years ago. But the company is still the same. Mr. Abrams. But, we should be capitalizing on the weaknesses, sir. If anything, we should be putting more money in. What about a bridge loan? Well, thank you. Thank you. I appreciate that. Yes. Yes. Absolutely. You too, sir. (thumps into glass) Ow! (screams) (groovy music) (sighs) - Went real well, did it? You try the loan angle? - Uh, yes. And he gave me a lecture about throwing good money after bad. Thanks. What are you doing? - I'm sending him a virus. - No, you're not. No you are not. He's gonna know it was you, and then what? Huh? You know, I'm out of dials at this point, okay. I have called everybody. Everybody! Even Stanley. - How is Stanley? - I don't know, 'cause he won't return my calls. - You shoulda let me call Stanley. - Oh, well, I would have, Josh, except you're allergic to the phone. - After all we've done for him, too. - What have we done for him? What have we done for him, Josh? - He's 21, he makes his own decisions, okay? C'mon. Things are a little tight. - Tight? Josh, things are a little worse than tight, Josh. A little worse. - Yeah? How much do we need? - 150. At least. - Wow. Asshole! (phone beeps) - Dad, are you gonna get that? - Ah. Okay, sorry. Yeah? - [Jeff] So, what's goin' on? - (laughs) What's using going on this time of night, Jeff. C'mon, I'm puttin' Danny to bed. What are you doin'? - We're havin' some coffee. - [Josh] I thought you were off tonight. - I swapped shifts. So, if you need me, call, okay? - Alright, thanks a lot. Now, can I put my son back to bed? - Alright. Hey, what kind of story you tellin' him? - Are you eating a doughnut? - [Jeff] Excuse me? Believe you'd ask me such a thing. - C'mon, I can smell the sugar from here. I can't believe your wife lets you eat that stuff. Look, I gotta go, alright? - [Jeff] Nighty-night. - Alright, see ya. So, alright. Where were we? - Frank was packing up his office. - Right. Okay, so, Frank knows the business is doomed. And, as you can well imagine, things look pretty bad. - A little early for cocktails, isn't it? - Not really. I always drink at funerals. - So, that's it, I mean, we just... Game over. Turn off the light, clean out the desk. What do I tell my kid? (bluesy music) - Hi, Mom. - [Mom] Is that everything? - Pretty much. Everything else is in storage. - I just don't understand how they can simply kick you out. Aren't there laws against this? - They didn't kick me out, Mom. I told you, the building has structural problems, and, besides, it's only for three or four months. - Well, what are all the other tenants doing? - I don't know. Maybe they got lawyers. I'm gonna go upstairs and unpack. I'm beat. Okay? (sighs) (grease crackles) - Why can't I call him from the office? - Because I think something is wrong. You can be late for once, he's out only son. Have some more coffee. - I've had enough. - Francis, your breakfast is ready. And your father has to leave. - [Frank] I'm coming. - He's coming. (sighs) Toast is ready. - I'm not really hungry, mom. - [Father] How'd you sleep? - Not so good. What's with the birds? They're louder than traffic. - This is what happens when you live in the city too long. You'd rather listen to sirens than to songbirds. - They're crows, mom, they're not songbirds. - So, tell us what's going on. - There's nothing to tell. Look, I don't want to turn this into a federal case, alright? - Are you sure they weren't looking for an excuse to turn the building into condos? - That would be illegal, dad. - [Father] That doesn't mean they won't still try to screw you, you know. - It's under control. - Alright, I'm not trying to push. Well, how is the work? And Josh? - [Frank] He's fine. - Hmm, well, I guess everything's fine. In that case, I can go to work. - Not so fast, honey. I bet it's weeks since you had a good breakfast. - Mom, this isn't breakfast. This is a heart attack waiting to happen. - Frank, please, just enjoy it, will ya? (clock chimes) (sighs) - You know, I gotta go. - You're not going anywhere until you eat. You know breakfast is the most important meal. - You know, it looks great, mom. But, I'm gonna be late for my meeting, so. You know what, I can save this, and I can have it for dinner. How about that? - Well, at least take the toast. You can eat it on the train. - It's a breakfast meeting, mom. - Enough. I'll drop you at the station. - So, how was Italy? - [Man] Not bad. But it's tiring being on the road. - So, let me get this straight. You're complaining about traveling first class to Milan and staying in a five star hotel. - Things are never what they seem, Frank. You of all people should know that. - Oh God, eating like that is gonna kill you. You know that, don't ya? - That might not be such a bad option. - Ooh. So, what's eating you? - Nothing, really. - You sure? Parents okay? - Mm-hmm. - How's business? - Good, busy. - Josh. - He's fine. - That's not what he told me. - You talked to Josh? - I ran into him last week. He told me the lights are out. Said he hasn't spoken to you in over a month. Hey. Come on. Every millionaire goes bust at least once in their life. You're gonna be fine. - You know how many resumes I've sent out? - Yeah, well, you're not alone. A lot of people feeling the pain. - Yeah, well, I don't need sympathy, I need work. Any work. I was thinking maybe you had something. - Well, sure, if I had something, but... - Well, what about marketing help? You know, Josh and I could build you a website. - I don't think Josh wants to talk to you right now. And, even if he did, when my customers want something, they pick up the phone and call. - Not forever they won't. Web is the future. - Well, you talk to me when that happens. In the meantime, there's too many boarded-up websites out there. You know, it's too bad you can't do something with all that junk. Hmm? - Hmm. (classical music) - You want a hit? - No. - It'll calm you down. - Who said I need calming down? I just gotta get back in the game. (hookah bubbles) (exhales sharply) Jesus Christ. - Dad. So, what's the story about? - What do you think it's about? - Is this one of your lesson stories? - No, absolutely not. This is pure action adventure. And there's also a wizard thrown in. - Dad, how come Sal smokes pot? - I never said Sal smokes pot. I said he smokes a water pipe. - I bet you smoked pot. - Never. Alright, come on let's get you... Give me that thing. Alright. Alright. So. Sal and Frank were playin' chess, and Sal says to Frank... - It's a temporary setback. - Living at home is more than a temporary setback. (hookah bubbles) Will you cut it out, Sal? Jesus, you're stinking up my clothes. - You just need to think smarter and work harder. Think smarter. - You're talking to me about working harder and smarter? Have you even made a sale this week? - That's not the point. - Oh, really? Well, then, maybe that's where I went wrong, because, I thought business was about making money. - Well, I must be making some, Frankie. After all, my lights are still on. So, which one of us is the schmuck, huh? - (sighs) You didn't talk this way a year ago. - Well, why would I talk? You're head was so swollen your ears were pinched shut. - Well, there goes your knight. - Listen. What do you see when you look around this place, Frankie? Huh? - An empty place. - That's why you crashed and burned, Frankie. You don't see beauty in anything. All you see is a fast buck. - Investors don't lend for beauty. - Checkmate. You ought to pay more attention to the game. Fiji. When's the last time you got laid, huh? - [Frank] It was on this chessboard, so. You were here. (laughs) - Alright. This is for you. And this goes in the garbage. Open it up. It's not gonna bite ya. Go ahead. - What? In Search of Self? What, are you kidding? You know I hate this self-help crap. It's all fortune cookie nonsense. And, you know, this is blank. Completely blank. - You expect someone else to write your life story. Legend has it that the wood from that pen is from Noah's Ark. - You expect me to believe that? - Did you hear me say it was a legend? - Look, I know my life story, okay? I'm living at home, I'm on the verge of a mid-life crisis I'm not even old enough to have, I've got no job, no cash, and I just lost a chess game to a pothead. - Hey, you're not old enough nor wise enough to have a midlife crisis. - Alright, enough, Sal. - Alright, listen, wait a second. Just wait a second. I want you to meet a friend of mine. She's a wizard. She's got the eyes. - What, are you a Zen master now? - Go and see her. - Okay. (hookah bubbles) - You want a hit? - No, I don't. You know, Sal, you oughta lay off the smoke. It's startin' to rot your brain. (curious music) (siren wails) - Wow, did I miss the weather or what? - Oh, I thought you were asleep. - No, no, no. I was just resting. Where have you been? - Just working. Hey, did the case settle? - Thank God they blinked. I'd hate it if I'd taken that one to trial. - Mm. Mom in bed? - Yeah, she left some pot roast on the stove. - I ate. Want me to put it away? - No, no, I'll take care of it. I might have just another little fork full. You okay? - Yeah, I'm fine, just a busy day. I think I'm gonna call it a day. - [Father] How's work? - Fine, fine. - Wanna watch the weather? - No, no, you can tell me in the morning. - You're not upset about moving back home, are you? Because you shouldn't be. I was at home all through law school. It's no big deal. - I appreciate that. - It's the truth! Your mother and I like having you here. So, stay as long as you like. But, just don't worry so much. And eat your mother's cooking, okay? - I will, Dad, but, seriously, she's gotta lay off the red meat and the fat. I mean, that will kill us. - You don't look like you're gonna die to me. - See you in the morning. Everything's fine, yeah. Nothin' wrong. Mm-hmm. Yeah, things are good. Mm-hmm. (traffic clamors) (metal chimes) - [Voiceover] In the meantime, there's too many boarded-up websites out there. You know, it's too bad you can't do something with all that junk. (laughs) - Let me know if I can help you find anything. - Oh, thanks. Uh... Actually, I'm looking for Clara. - Any reason in particular. - Yeah, a friend of hers, a friend of mine, actually, said that I should come see her. - And what's your friend's name? - Sal. He has a chess shop downtown. (laughs quietly) - Then you must be Frank and I must be Clara. - Hi. - Hi. - So, this is a nice shop you have here. What's with all the, uh, stuffed animals? - My father was a taxidermist. I think I inherited his love for bringing the dead back to life. - That's a little creepy, isn't it? - Some people may think so. I just think it's unusual. Are you unusual? - Not like Sal, if that's what you mean? (clock cuckoos) So, have you known him long? - Sal? Kind of. We met in Scotland about 326 years ago. - Really. Well, you look great for your age. So, I guess that's why he called you the wizard. - The trick to life is to think young and not always believe your eyes. Wizard, I don't know, but, I can see things that other people can't. - Like, what, my underwear? - I didn't mean that, but, um, say, since you brought it up. You're wearing white briefs. - Okay. (laughs) - If you want, I could see deeper into your soul. - I think we should, uh, not go that deep today. - Don't worry, you have a good soul. I mean, you're a bit screwed up, but life does that to people. Especially when you're unemployed. - Did Sal tell you that? - You do computers? - Oh, so, you've been talking to Sal. - If you wanna think that. So, what happened? - Even millionaires go bust once in their life. - [Clara] Is that your dream? To be a millionaire? - Why not? I mean, is there a problem being rich? - I didn't say that. I just think that maybe it should be the ending and not the beginning. (door chimes) - Um. I better go. - Yeah. Well, let me know if you need any help. (traffic clamors) (sighs) (phone bleeps) (phone rings) - Chess Forum. - [Frank] Hey, Sal, it's Frank. - Frankie! Come on over, man, I'm here with Mike. - No, I can't, I got a meeting. - What is it with you and meetings? You're always going to a meeting. Do you actually do anything at these meetings? - Listen. I just met your friend, Clara. So, what was that, like, a fix-up? - What, with Clara? - [Frank] No, your mother. - No, Frankie, I wouldn't do that. - Oh, you wouldn't, huh? - No, Frankie. My mother is dead. Frankie! Hey, Frank, c'mon! (phone beeps) Lost his sense of humor. (energetic music) - So. Can you tell me how this job interview went, or what? - Nothin' said, they hired somebody else. I think I'm too old. Pretty soon age discrimination is gonna start at, like, 25. (laughs) Don't laugh, Frank, I needed that. Unlike you, I got a family to support. - Forget about it, it was a nowhere job. I got something much better. - Yeah, that's what you said to me last time, and I'm back to drinking domestic. - What, do you blame me? What did I do? Look, you and I both know a lot about advertising on the Internet, right? - So what? Nobody's gonna touch the web. What about food? C'mon, people still gotta eat. What about the internet cafe idea. - What, have you been talking to Stanley? Josh, you really wanna be worried about people coming up and complaining about their french fries are cold and the network went down. I got something much better. Web boards. - Web board, what the fuck is a web board? - It's kind of like a billboard, except we use bankrupt websites, and we put ads on them and call them web boards. We take dead dot com sites and we're gonna turn them into advertising opportunities. (laughs) - Where do you come up with these ideas? - Don't laugh, look at this. I got the business plan right here. I think I can get this funded, Josh. - When did you do this? - Nights. It's mostly a cut and paste job, but it proves that we can capitalize on this. Now, I know you think it's bullshit, but, will you at least consider it? Hmm? - [Josh] You really think you can find someone stupid enough to fund this? - Yeah, I do, actually. The numbers work. - Equal partners? - 60/40. - Come on, friends are supposed to share things equally. - It's my idea, Josh. - What about startup cash? - I'm working on that. I have a meeting set up with Abrams. And I sent it to a few other VCs as well. - That's a nice toss. - [Receptionist] Hi, can I help you? - Yes, I'm Frank Costello to see Mr. Abrams. - What? - Frank Costello to see Mr. Abrams, please. - [Receptionist] Mr. Abrams, Mr... What? - Costello. - Mr. Costello is here to see you. Sure. He said to go back. - Thanks. - [Receptionist] It's the first door on your left. - Yeah... - Listen, my boss wants me to ask if you want some coffee. Would you like some? - Oh, no, no, thank you. - Oh, good, because I don't get coffee. I can tell you where it is, though, if you change your mind. - Alrighty, I'll keep that in mind. (knocks on door) - Hello, Frank. How's your father? - Oh, he's fine, thanks. - Please, sit. You look hot. How 'bout some spring water. - Sure, thanks. - Did you know that coffee dehydrates ya? It's as bad as alcohol. - [Frank] No, I didn't know that. - Yeah, and people think that all liquids are the same, but nothing is ever what it seems. And I've seen it all. Go ahead, enjoy. Spring water, that's what flushes the pipes and keeps the piss pure. I bet yours is yellow. Piss should be clear. You drink eight glasses a day, watch the difference. You'll thank me. - Hmm. I'd rather thank you for other things, Mr. Abrams. - I haven't read your business plan yet. You mind walking me through it? - Well, it's right there in front of you. I can walk you through it quickly if you'd like. - Mr. Abrams, when you drive down the highway, what do you see? - Traffic. - That's right, traffic, sure. But, what else? - I don't know, all sorts of things. Um, road signs, potholes, buildings. - What about billboards? You ever seen any billboards? - Sure, too many. - Yeah, lots of billboards. And it doesn't matter if the buildings are vacant or not, you still read the billboards because they're in your face. Now, that's the model behind WebBoards. These bankrupt dot com sites are like vacant buildings littering the superhighway, but, they still get thousands of hits a day. It's prime advertising space, and WebBoards can make money both leasing and linking to these sites. That's the pitch. So, what do you think? - Would you, uh, like some more water? (curious music) - Maybe just the bathroom. - Hi, Frank. - Hi, Jane, how are you? - I'm going on vacation next week. You wanna come and lay in the sun with me? - No, I hate the beach. Too much time to reflect. - Not to me. The only time I'm gonna leave it is to get a drink, a man, and some sleep, and in that order. Your dad's in the conference room. - Send me a postcard? - Something topless? - Well, only if they're real, Jane. (chuckles) - [Father] Now, I don't think my client would agree to this. (knocks on glass) Look, can I call you back in about an hour? Someone's just coming into the office I'm gonna have to talk to. Right, okay. - Hey, Dad. - Anything wrong? - No, no, everything's fine. I just wanted to talk to you about something. - Mm-hmm. Well, make it fast, I've got a deposition in an hour and I can't cancel it. - I'm not really comfortable asking you this, but, um, I'm kind of in a jam. I was wondering if I could maybe borrow some money. - What, you got some problems with the business or what? - No, that's fine, it's just some of the work got pushed back a quarter. You know how that is. - How much do you need? Well, I was thinking, maybe, 5,000, if that's okay. - Frank, I tried calling your office. - Does Mom know? - I'm not the one to tell her. (sighs) - I'm sorry. I didn't know what to say to you guys. It's hard admitting you're a fuckup. - Son, you are many things, but a fuckup is not one. Alright. I'll give you, um, 4,000. Nobody gets everything they want. And I think, uh, 80% is pretty damn good. Now, when are you going to tell her? - I was thinking maybe never. - Never is too long, think sooner. After all, it is your mother, you know. Was the story about the apartment bullshit too? - Yes, but I'll get out as soon as I can. - No, I didn't mean that, the room is yours. All I'm asking is that you eat your mother's cooking. I mean, I know it's a little greasy, but... - Well. Maybe we can get her a nonstick frying pan. (chuckles) Alright, thanks. And I'll get it back to you as soon as I can. - Is there anything else you wanna talk about. - Not really. Well, there is one thing, but, I don't think you'll understand, and I know mom definitely won't. - [Father] Well, maybe I'll surprise you. - I met a wizard. - A wizard? - Yeah, actually I met a she-wizard, and, uh, I'm having dinner with her. - I gave you money to have dinner with a she-wizard, huh? - Come on, Dad, it's not like that. I mean, maybe she can help me see better. - Well, I think if you're having trouble with your eyes you ought to see an eye doctor. Now get out of here before I change my mind. - Will do. And thanks again. (romantic piano music) - Hi, come on in. This is my house. - Uh, this is for you. - Oh, thank you. That is very sweet of you. Sal did not tell me that you were a gentleman. Let me put this in some water. - This is a great apartment you have here. - [Clara] Thank you. I love color. I love color and flowers. Here you go. I hope you like sushi. - You know, actually, I don't, uh, I don't eat raw fish. - Okay, I should've asked, um, well, we have dumplings, two kinda of dumplings, and there's seaweed salad, which is really good for you. And, I've got some edamame, which is, um, very good, and I'm gonna show you how to eat it, 'cause you have to know how to eat it. You just put it in your mouth, and then you such out the bean. (slurping) Like that. - So, um, how long have you had your store for? - Um, oh, about 10 years. Before that, I was a singer. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm. - So, what happened? (sighs) - Life. So, now I sing in the shower, or at family weddings, or at friends' weddings. - Plus you're a wizard. - No, Sal says I'm a wizard. But, I am a little psychic. - Now, let me get this straight. Does that mean you know when the Knicks are gonna win? - (chuckles) Still with the jokes, huh? - What? - You know, it's a lot more scientific than that. Actually, for such important questions, I'd like to consult my oracle, excuse me. Ta-da! - You gotta be kidding. - No. See, you think this is crazy because you think this is just, like, a silly 8-ball. But, actually, it is a delivery system through which my energy passes. So, if you wanna ask a question, you have to have the energy flow through both of us so we, you know, maybe we should hold hands or something just for the energy, for us to flow, obviously. - Should I get a little closer? - Yeah, a little bit closer. Okay, like that, is that close enough? - Yes, it's close, just ask the question. - Uh. Will I get the money for WebBoards? - Okay, don't think about it. And the answer is most likely. - How soon? - It has to be, like, a yes or no question. - Oh, okay, will I get the money soon? - Will he get the money for WebBoards soon? Yes. (chuckles) - Excellent. - Okay, not, it's my turn. Should you spend the night? (phone rings) - Hello. Yes, this is WebBoards. Speaking. Yeah, I remember. Yeah, I sent it to you last week. (energetic music) Hi, I'm supposed to meet Gene Williams. You know where I might find him? - Are you Mr. Costello? - Yes, yes. - Wallet. - (scoffs) Wallet? - Mr. Williams said you are to meet him in steam room. You been here before? - No, uh, steam room? - No black mud treatment? Opens up pours, takes out toxins. - I'm sure that's true, no thank you. - Take the door on the left, any locker. - Thank you. - Oak leaf treatment, on house. (steam whooshes) - Gene? - [Gene] You must be Frank. Find it okay? - Uh, no problem. - Thanks. I love the steam. Clears the pours and lungs. You don't mind meeting here, do you? - Beats having coffee at McDonalds. - I steam every day. Been doing it for over 10 years. Like it? - Not really, it makes me sweat. (laughs) - Thanks, boys. So. I read your business plan. Not bad. You write it? - Yes. - According to my reading, you need about four, 450 to get this bird to fly. Think that'll do it? - I know it. - Confidence. I like that. But, now comes the tough stuff. Say my firm did give you the financing you're looking for. What makes your concept so unique? - Me. It's my idea. No one else thought of it. - (chuckles) Exactly. - I don't understand. - What stops a copycat? What stops someone from taking this idea, undercutting you, then blowing past you faster than shit through a goose? - It's my plan. I bring the vision and the management. - Come on. I can have a truckload of MBAs delivered to my doorstep by 9am., no, make that 8am, tomorrow morning. - I don't understand. I mean, you read the business plan. You saw by reading it that there weren't any patents involved. I mean, why bother even getting together? - I wanted to meet my competition. - Is this a joke? - Not to me. I've been listening for a reason why I need you, and you haven't give me one. - (coughs) How about the fact that it's my idea and how about the fact that, to cut me out, would be completely unethical? - Calm down, Frank. I'm not a lawyer, but I'm sure you know, you have no claim to an idea. I deal in business, and business has only one rule. It's the golden rule. The guy with the gold rules. Look, I worked hard on this idea. Okay? You can't cut me out. You know, my father is an attorney. - Courts are open to everyone, so be my guest. - Well, there's another reason. - I hope it's better than the others, Frank. (tense music) - I'm gonna... I'm gonna... (Frank thumps on the floor) (light classical music) (light snoring) (coughs) - Excuse me. Do you know if there is anyone who can help me? - Well, that depends on what kind of help that you need. - Sales help, please. - Well, that would be me. - And you are? - Me? That's a long story. - Could you tell me about this? - That? - Yeah. That's called The Florentine. The board is made of alabaster and the pieces are, uh, bronze and are gold and silver plated. - It's just gorgeous. I think it would be perfect for my coffee table. - Now, that would be a waste. - I beg your pardon? - He said, uh, do you play? - No. I just thought it would be a wonderful conversation piece. - I prefer conversations about sex. - You know, I've had my eye on that set myself. But, I'm gonna have to wait 'til I hit the lottery. - How much is it? - $6,700. - Really? That much. - I'd say that was cheap, lady. - Couldn't you do a little bit better? I've seen it for less. - Where? - On the Internet. - Get outta my store! - Well, you don't have to be rude. I was just asking about the price. Oh, for God's sakes. - That's a hell of a way to make a sale, Sal. - She'll be back. Or she'll send her slave. - Yeah, what makes you so sure? - Because she's full of shit, that's why. No dot com piece of shit sells for less than I do. - So, I met Clara. She's no wizard, Sal. - Big deal, Frankie. - Sal, she consults a bowling ball. - We've had presidents who consulted astrologists. She's someone to talk to, do you like to talk to her? - Yeah, but it's not gonna work out. - Why not? - Because she likes sushi. Sal, raw fish, she's like a cannibal. - She likes to eat it raw. It's every man's fantasy. - No, it's a sign we're incompatible. - You're not thinkin' straight, Frankie. - Yeah, well, I don't know what to think. You know, I was at a meeting, this guy tells me, to my face, he's gonna steal my idea. Yeah, and the funny thing is, I didn't think my idea was good enough to steal. - So, what did you do? - Well, what could I do? - What could you do? This is what you could do, Frankie. - Jesus, Sal. Put it down before somebody comes in. - A guy like that needs to know that there are ethical ramifications to his actions. If a guy like that did something like that to me, I'd put one right in his back. - Sal, you can't shoot people in the back, okay? It's like completely against the Geneva Convention. - Did you ever hear of mustard gas? - What? - Guys like that are amoral, and they need to die. An amoral death. - Sal. Seriously. - [Sal] Frank. - [Frank] Sal. - Sal, Sal, Sal. - [Sal] Frank, Frank. - [Frank] Sal, Sal. (screams) (laughs) - You're sick, you know. You're a sick, you're a sick, sick man. - So, what, we're all sick here, this is New York. - That's not funny. - When are you gonna realize that a man either has balls or goes through his life peeing in his pants. - I could've had a heart attack. - Your heart's fine, it's your mind that needs to be placed on life support. - I'm not kidding, you know, I passed out in that steam room. - So, you steamed too long, so what, it happens. - [Frank] Pry my mother's cookin'. - See, you always have excuses. Have you started writing? - What am I gonna write? I have nothing to write about. - When you gonna learn, Frank. Everyone has a story. Even you. Checkmate. - What? - Excuse me. My mother was just in here looking at this chess set, may I see it? - What did I tell you, Frankie? Drinks are on me. - Dad. I need to use the bathroom. - You do that, and I will check on your mom. Everything okay? - Oh, I want him out. How's the story going? - He's a tough critic. - (laughs) Try and remember he's only 10. - Going on 35. Can I get you anything? - Yeah. Whiskey and that leftover curry on the second shelf of the refrigerator. - Really? - Shelly went into labor when she had whiskey and Indian food. - I hear sex does it. - [Danny] Dad, I'm ready. - What happened to the girl I married? (elevator dings) And so, about a week later, Josh and Frank went to see Mr. Abrams. - What? (sighs) - I got to go to the bathroom. (water splashes) What's the matter, Frank? Too much time to reflect? Hmm? To much time on your hands just to reflect, starin' at yourself in the mirror, day after day. When is it gonna change, Frankie? When will it fuckin' change? (speaks in foreign language) (scoffs) Um. I don't know what just happened, but, um, if you can hear me, um, please... (sighs) - You alright? - Sure. (briefcase slams on counter) - Hi. Can I help you? Yeah. I'm Frank Costello, this is my associate Josh Gilbert. We're here to see Mr. Abrams. - [Receptionist] I'll let him know that you're here. - Great. - Mr. Abrams, Mr. Costello and Mr. Gilbert are here to see you. Sure. He said you can go right back. - Thanks, love. - Would either of you like some coffee? - No. But, if we do, we'll get it ourselves, won't we? (knocks on door) - Mr. Abrams. This is my partner, Josh Gilbert. - Hi. - Nice to meet you, Josh. Sit. How 'bout some fresh spring water? - I'm all set, thanks. - And I've already had my eight glasses for the day, so... - Well, then let's get to the good news is that I decided to take a second look. Any idea why? It's simple. Venture capital runs on two rules. The first is that no one knows what the next Microsoft looks like, and the second is every new idea seems stupid. The Wright Brothers had a stupid idea, and Edison had several. - And the bad news? - Well, I'm afraid it's too small for us. - No problem, we'll just make it bigger. - It's not that simple, and also, it's not quite what we're looking for. - I'm sorry, but why are we here? - I wanted to meet both brains before I give it to a group of private investors who deals within your funding figures. They're willing to sit down. - Finally. Thank God. - God may not have anything to do with this. How about thankin' me? - Oh, you're absolutely right. Thank you, thank you Mr. Abrams. Thank you so much. - His name is Eugene Arnold. You call him at this number, and use my name. - And, just out of curiosity. What's the finder's fee if this goes down? - Nothing this time, but next time I'll take your first born. Just joshing, Josh. (laughing) (jazz music) (overlapping conversations) - Just remember, we're not committing to anything. We're just gonna hear him out, alright? - I was gonna tell you the exact same thing. - [Josh] Hi. - [Frank] Good evening. - Hi, we have reservations with a party by the name of Eugene Arnold. - He already arrived. If you follow me, I'll show you to your seat. - Great. - We're just gonna hear him out, alright? - [Frank] Josh, enough. (laughing) (knocks on door) - [Eugene] Come and join us, Gentlemen. Thank you, Angela. Which one is Frank? - I am, this is my partner, Josh Gilbert. - I'm Eugene. - Hi. And this is my cousin, Peter. - Nice to meet you. And you. - Please, sit down. I'm having the hanger steak, and Peter went for the porterhouse. Either one is a blue chip. - I guess I'll have the hanger then. How 'bout you, Josh? - Uh. Maybe just a piece of fish for me. - Josh, we're in a steakhouse. - Thank you, Frank, I wasn't aware of that. - Don't tell me you're worried about your cholesterol. - (laughs) Maybe just a heart attack. - You know, when I was in college, during the summer, I used to work at a fish processing plant. And some of the fish that came in off the boats had so much cancer from the PCBs, that by the time we cut all the tumors off the fish, there was only enough left for fish cakes. - Perhaps the shrimp scampi would be a good compromise. - Yeah, that would be fine. - And, Richie, pour a shiraz for the carnivore. And a pinot grigio for Josh. So, you met with Abrams. - Yes, and he said you liked the plan, and he thought there might be a possible fit. - That's true. But, to be perfectly honest, Frank, I don't know much about the Internet. All my investments have been in old economy businesses, but, Abrams things I need to diversify. - Well, you know, it's true, the Internet has taken quite a hit. But, what industry hasn't? You know, I still think there's a lot of upside potential, and, let's face it, it's sexier than most. - It also offers more risk. - Well, the only way I know to avoid risk is to invest in T-bills. - Well, I never said that I was adverse to risk, I just prefer to minimize it. - Well, I think we've addressed that concern by offering very conservative growth projections. - You did, and it's one of the reasons your plan caught my eye. I also happen to think your idea has potential. Although, what do I know? My kids are glued to those chat rooms, and I can't even turn on a computer. (laughing) - What do you think, Peter? - Well, I understand the model. - But, do you think it'll fly? - Well, flight's a funny think, Josh. I mean, can man fly? Some say yes, some say no. But when I'm on an airplane five miles up, I think that I can fly, but, I know that I need a plane and a pilot. So, when you ask me if it can fly, I need to know first if your plane is air worthy, and secondly, if you two are good pilots. - Fair enough. So, what do we have to do to make you say yes to these questions? - Did Abrams tell you what type of businesses I like to invest in? - We didn't get that far. - Waste management. Solid, liquid, and nuclear. You know why? Because America is a disposable society. We throw out more trash than half the world. That makes for profit margins as lucrative as bottled water. - Well, now, nothing is as lucrative as bottled water, I mean, not gasoline, not even fancy coffee. - Yeah, whatever, Josh. - And, like us, you also deal in garbage. - I don't think I follow. - I'm not sure I do either. - You wrote the plan, didn't ya? - Yes, but I don't recall anything about garbage in it. - Well, tell us what you two know about garbage. - I don't think I know anything about garbage. Except you put it out on Wednesday nights. - Websites that go belly up. What did you call them again? - Vacant buildings. - Right, vacant buildings. And you know what a vacant building is to me, Frank? - Garbage. - Exactly. - You see, I can visualize what you do, because the Internet is built by humans. And if there's one thing humans make, it's waste. I invest in waste. You manage waste. All that other stuff about networks and backbones, forget it. I'm no doctor. Waste management, I understand. But there is one thing I don't understand, gentlemen. And that's a company without profits. Investors need to see black on the bottom line. - Not a problem. We'll be in the black in eighteen months. - You know, if I invest, I need to see profits within one year. - Now, come on. We'll hardly be operational by then. - It's a deal breaker, Josh. - We can do it in a year. - [Eugene] Don't say it unless you can deliver. - No, we can do it. - Josh? - Well, I'm, thanks. Well, I'm strictly the technology side, but Frank wouldn't say it if he couldn't do the numbers. - Good. Eat. How's the steak? - You can cut it with a fork. - [Eugene] And the shrimp? - Tumor free, thanks. (laughs) - You're a funny guy, Josh. - Now, there's one last item, and that concerns Peter. Since it's my money, I want somebody managing it I can trust. So, Peter comes on board as the CFO. - Not a problem. - No, wait. Don't you think we ought to have somebody with some accounting a business management experience? - That's true. Do you have any experience? - I studied business in college. I think I can balance the books. - Oh, that's good enough for me, how 'bout you, Josh? - You know, Mr. Arnold, we just met. Maybe we outghta take a step back and think about this a minute. - Josh, my father always told me, too much thinking makes you stupid. (laughing) - I could second that. Well, I think that went pretty good. - Do you? - Sure, why not? - What you doing, Frank? - I'm going home, it's late. - That's not what I'm talkin' about. - Look, I negotiated the best deal I could. I mean, what do you expect them to give us the money with no strings attached? - Why didn't you just pull down his pants and kiss his ass? - I was trying to make it work, what's your problem anyway? - My problem is these people don't even know what we do. I mean, they deal in waste management. - So? - So, we don't have anything in common. - Yeah we do. Money. They've got it and we need it. So, we close the deal. - But at what price? - Josh, when no one else is bidding, any price is a good price. You know what, we just came from a funeral. Here. - This is not worth celebrating, alright? Look, if you wanna walk away, walk away. - I'm not saying that. I'm just saying it's not a perfect fit. - There's no such thing as a perfect fit, or a perfect opportunity. But, what we do, Josh, is we take this imperfect opportunity and we make it work to our advantage. - You don't turn chicken shit into chicken salad, alright? It's all I'm saying. - Screw chickens, man. I just wanna take lemons and turn 'em into lemonade, okay? Now, are you with this or what? Alright. - [Jack] Hey, maybe we should finish this tomorrow. - No, keep going. - Are you sure, your eyes are filling up with sand. - I'm awake. So, does Frank become Bill Gates or somethin'? - Well, you gotta be patient. Okay, Frank and Josh dive into their work with all the enthusiasm and energy of a new startup. I mean, they god long hours, late dinners, hardly any sleep. In fact, things are lookin' pretty good. I mean, their burn rate is low, they even got lucky with a couple of clients. Frank's able to move back into his high-living apartment. Josh moves his family into a Manhattan loft. They're finally back in the game. Or, so they thought. A couple of months pass, and while Frank is workin' at his desk, Peter walks into his office. - Frank. - Yeah. - Can I talk to you for a minute. - Oh, sure, come on in. - Peter, I haven't even had my coffee yet, and you're closing my door? - (laughs) It's just better to do this alone. Eugene has this idea that he wants me to run by you about adjusting the business, a little. - What exactly does that mean? - He wants me to turn Phoenix into a holding company. - I mean, you understand that term, right? - Yeah, yeah, it's like a parent company which holds several other companies. But we don't have several companies, Peter. - Right, but, he does. - Okay. So, we're a holding company. - [Peter] So, I can tell him you're cool with that? - Is there a downside? - Well, there's additional accounting, but, uh, I can deal with that. - You're the CFO, and, if it's okay with you, it's okay with me. - Okay, so, I'll pass it by you as soon as I have it all worked out. - Sounds great. - Oh, and by the way. Eugene wanted me to tell you how much he appreciates the way that you and Josh have gotten the place up and running so fast. He's authorized bonuses for you both. - Really? That's great, man, I can totally use that. Great. Hey, you wanna have lunch? - No, I can't. I'm on my way to meet with a potential client. - That's the second one this week, who is it? - No way, the last time I opened my mouth we didn't get it. But, I will tell you, if we get it it's a big one. - Big is good. - Big is better than good. - (laughs) Alright. (laughs) Josh, where are you. Don't, don't. Meet me at El Vagabando in 45 minutes, okay? Just don't worry about that, I'll explain when we get there, okay? Josh, Josh, Josh, just get there, alright? Will you, please? Thank you. (sighs) (tense music) - So, what's up? - Mornin' Frank. - Mornin'. - Some coffee? - Yeah, please. - Anything else? - How about you, Josh? - No, I'm all set, thanks. - Have some toast. - I don't want any toast. - Have some toast. - I don't want any toast. - You know what, give us two cinnamon toasts, but, for him, don't give him any butter, okay? Not so fast. I have to talk to you about a business thing, and I want to do it calmly, because I know you have a tendency to panic. But, there's no need to panic, not at this point. - That's reassuring. - Peter told me this morning that he's turning us into a holding company. Are you listening to me? - Yeah, we're turning into a holding. - [Frank] Thanks. - Thanks. We're becoming a holding company, so what? - Do you know what one is? - Yeah, what, it's a quiz? It's like when a big company takes other businesses and holds them under their umbrella. - Right, very good, that's good, Josh. Yeah, they're consolidating their other businesses, and they're turning us into a holding company. - Uh-huh. - You don't get it, do you? Josh, I think we're being turned into a laundromat. - Yeah, I thought they were in the rubbish business. - What is with you, okay? You know, I just checked, you know how much money we have? - I have no idea. - 900. - Nine? - How did we go through all that so fast? - 900 thousand, Josh. - That is not possible, where did that come from? - I don't know, and I don't wanna know. Question is, what are we gonna do about it? - Nothin'. We don't know anything about it, we haven't done anything wrong, period. - We know the books are dirty. And Peter is giving us a bonus, why is he doing that? - Because we deserve it. - We deserve it. - Yeah. - Or to keep us quiet, what about that, huh? - Look, Frank, c'mon. We're makin' good money, I got my family, you're living large again. We don't have a problem, c'mon. - The problem is we could be in some very deep shit. - What's the alternative? You go to the cops and you're back living with your parents again. - Beats living in a jail cell. You got a better idea? - Yeah, we do nothing. - Oh, yeah, well, that's good for three to five. - Look, Frank, like I said, technically, we didn't do anything wrong. Okay, finish your coffee, I'm going back to work. - So, just like that, huh? Business as usual. - Well, on second thought, we should probably get out a life insurance policy. - What? - What, you think I'm stupid? - No, I never said you were stupid, Josh. Eugene said that. Tom, can I get a check? - Yeah. (clock gongs) - Dad. - Oh, must've dozed off, what time is it? Did I miss the weather or what? - Yes, you did. - Well, how did it go today? - Okay. - What's wrong? - Why do you think something's wrong. - I'm your father. - It's nothing I can't handle. - Is that all I get? - No, no. You get this. - Oh, thank you. - Thanks for the loan. - No problem. - And this is for not telling mom. - What did you do, win the lottery or what? - Kind of. Me and Josh got bonuses. - Oh. - So, what do you think, you like it? - It's very nice, very nice. - You can play movies on it. - Well, I take your mother out if I wanna see a movie. What did you do to deserve this bonus. - Well, I guess they like the way Josh and I are running the company. - Oh. Congratulations, then. - Hey, dad, let me ask you a legal question. Hypothetically. - Yeah. - If someone's messing with a company's books, but the owner of the company doesn't know that somebody's messing with them, could he be in trouble? - Well, it depends, I mean, if he doesn't know, that's fine. But if he suspects something, and he's an officer in the company, that definitely implicates him. Why? Something wrong? - No, no, no, no, I was talking to a friend of mine, he works on Wall Street, and he was telling me a story. - Mm-hmm. Well, if your friend wanted some legal advice, advise that people that cook the books generally get burned. - I mean, do you see my point here? - Yes, yes, I do. But, like every client, they're trying to put 10 pounds of manure into a five pound bag. - This is a weed. You know what, I am absolutely done with this. Be my guest. - What is wrong with you? Don't ignore me, Frank. - Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know you were talking. - You signed off on this? - What are you talking about? - Don't, please, I know you, Frank. Please. - Josh, what are you talking about? Where are you going? Josh, what are you talking about? - Ask Peter, alright? - What does Peter have to do with anything? - Look, this isn't funny, Frank. - Who said it was funny? Josh, get over here, Josh, stop right now. - Frank says he knows nothing about the tobacco account. - What tobacco account? - I closed on a smoke deal, a major smoke deal. - We agreed no porno, no guns, no tobacco. We agreed to that, didn't we? - The numbers were too good to pass up. - What was the offer? - I don't care what the offer, I don't care if it's 10 grand a site. - [Peter] It's more. - It's more than 10 grand? - Potentially, five times more. - We're gonna need to rethink this, Josh. - Fuck it. - He'll come around. - You know, Frank, I like Josh. But he's startin' to get in the way of business. - He'll be fine. What are you doing? - What does it look like I'm doing? Last time I waited too long, you boxed up first. This time, you can turn out the lights, okay? - Look, Josh, I don't know what your problem is. - You know, not only are you a whore, willing to sell out your best friend for an Armani suit, but you do it and you make it seem like I'm the problem. - You're the one that said we can make this work. - Yeah, well, I guess I was wrong, okay? - [Frank] Josh, enough, okay, I need you. - Yeah, well, it's a little late for that, isn't it? - You really think they're just gonna let you walk away? - I'm not washing money and I'm not selling tobacco to kids. Okay, my father died of lung cancer, Frank. - You never told me that. - Yeah, well. I also got a kid who looks up to me. I'd like to keep it that way. - I heard you, Josh, I heard you. I will think of something, alright, but we are in a dog eat dog situation in here, and we need to make sure we don't get eaten. (sighs) Christ, motherfucker. (melancholic music) Hey, it's Frank. Is Peter in his office? Do you know when he's gonna be back? (tense music) (knocks on door) - [Man] Come in. - Hi, I'm Frank Costello, I spoke to you on the phone. - Sure, have a seat. You have signing authority on this account? - Yes. - Then, I just need some identification. Okay, how would you like that? - Hundreds. - Well, an amount this large, I'll have to place a special order. It'll take a couple hours. - Okay, when do you close? - [Man] 4 o'clock. - I'll see you at 3:30. - Very good. - [Frank] Thanks again. - [Man] Sure. - May I speak to Peter, please. - What's goin' on? (grunts) Easy! Fuck. - Good morning, Frank. - What's going on? - How should I know? So, Peter, (laughs) what's goin' on? You'll find out. Just relax. Help yourself to a drink from the bar. - Listen, Peter, if it's about the tobacco account thing, I mean, I'm sure that we can work that out. - Yeah, Peter, I mean, Josh was just kidding. I mean, weren't you, Josh? - Right, I mean, all the time... - Would you shut the fuck up? (engine revs) (funky music) (laughing) (shouting in foreign language) (laughing) (shouting in foreign language) - Now, which one of you is Frank, huh? - Who wants to know? - Pedro. (punch thuds) (grunts) (gasps for air) - I'm sorry, my mistake. (cries out) - I ask the questions, si? - [Frank and Josh] Si. - Frank. We can do this the hard way or the easy way. The choice is yours. - Well, I always say, why make it hard when you can make it easy? - Be careful, your life is not worth the trouble you have caused me. (gargles) Where is my money, huh? - What is he talking about, Frank? - He doesn't know anything about this. - Josh doesn't have anything to do with anything. - I ask again. Where is my money, huh? - Don't worry, it's safe. - [Roberto] In a safe? - No. - What he means is, he has it. - In a safe? - It's safe. - That's what I said, in a safe. - I think I'm gonna throw up. - Where's the money, Frank? - My father has it. - He's lying. - [Roberto] He's lying. - [Thug] He's lyin'! - Enough! - I swear. Is that real? - There's one way for sure to find out, my friend. - Wait. I need a phone. Call your father, tell him Josh is coming by to pick up the money. - Yeah, yeah, I'll go. - Make it convincing, or we shoot Josh. - What? - Hi, Jane, it's Frank, is my father there? Do you know when he's gonna be back? No, that's okay, I'll just call back, thanks. You too. Yeah, he'll be back in 20 minutes. - Okay, Peter. Drive Josh over there, call us from the street. For Frank's sake, don't screw this up, Josh. - I can't believe you got me into this! - Fight him back like a man, man. I should blow your balls off, but I'm feeling good today. - How good? - Very good. (laughs) I want you to pee pee in your pants, huh? - What? - You heard me. - Pee pee. - Do it. - You're kidding. - Either you pee pee, or I blow them off. - Okay, okay. (tense music) (heavy breathing) This is really hard with you standing there. - You need some privacy? - Yeah. - I don't got all day, man, I wanna hear it. I wanna hear that stream, man. (water trickles) (sighs) Yellow, man. You gotta drink more water. - At least eight glasses a day. - You act like a boy, I treat you like one. Now sit down. This never should've happened, man. - That's obvious. How would I know they'd do something so stupid. - They also know too much. - That's not my line of work. - [Roberto] What if the money isn't there, huh? - Frank, tell Roberto he'll get his money. - Oh, you'll definitely get your money. - Oh, I better get my money, man. - [Eugene] Okay. - [Roberto] Okay. - Now, if you need me for anything, I'll be in my office. (sirens wail) (shouts in foreign language) (sirens wail and tires screech) - FBI, Roberto! We got you surrounded. Give it up, get your hands up! - Hey, put your guns down or I kill Mr. Frank. - We can't do that, amigo. You let him go and we'll parley. - There's no way out, Roberto, let my lawyer handle this. He'll have us out by this evening. Don't shoot, I give up! (gun fires) (grunts) (sad music) (gun fires) - You shot him in the back. - Is there any other way for lawyer-licking cowards to die? (tense music) Listen. Mr. Frank is next. I shoot him unless you back off. - You're in a heap of trouble, boy. Where are you gonna go? - Get up! I want a plane to Cuba! - We can't do that, it's a Republican administration. - Well, then I want political asylum. I'm a Cuban refugee. - No problemo. Just put down the gun. - Somehow I don't believe you, amigo. - This is your last change, Roberto. - Please don't hurt my son. - Your son? Your son has no balls, man. Look at him, no balls, he pee peed in his pants. Someone get him a diaper, man! (gun fires) (guns fire) (screams) (angelic music) (grunts) (funky music) - Dad! I screwed up. Tell mom I love her. And I do like her cooking. Where's Josh? - Right here buddy. - Josh, I never meant to be a whore. - Could've fooled me. - [Father] Me too. - Dad. I couldn't even make lemonade. - [Paramedic] One, two, clear. (machine beeps) - We were just talking, then, all of a sudden, he passed out. Is he gonna be okay? - Hopefully. Okay, let's get him an IV and get him out of here. This place makes me sweat. (machine beeps) - You had us worried. - Where am I? - Where do you think you are? - May I see Josh? - Who's Josh? - I have to talk to Josh. - Whoa, whoa, Frank, listen, not so fast. You know what happened? You remember being in the steam room? Frank, you had a heart attack. You passed out and fell, you hit your head pretty hard. You remember any of that? - Kind of. - How's your vision, any blurriness? - How did I get here? - By ambulance. If you want a blow by blow, that paramedic is outside. Get some rest, I'll be right back. Frank. This is Emily. She's the paramedic who got your heart pumpin'. - [Emily] Hey, Frank, how's the bump? - Don't I know you? - Frank, let me just take a look. - You're the paramedic that saved me? - It's no big deal. I mean, it is for you, but it's my job. How you doin'? - Fine. I'm just trying to decide if I'm happy to be alive or if I with I was dead. - I would recommend life. I think we're all gonna die soon enough. - Easy for you to say, life isn't hell. - Frank, I'm gonna have 'em come in and give you something to relax. - So, you probably hear this all the time, but, I feel like I should do something to repay you. - Oh, well, we don't accept tips, so... - What about dinner? - Dinner we can do. Yeah, when you're feeling better. Just not sushi, I don't eat raw fish. - The Ilenroy House was opened in June of 1929. - [Jack] Over the next few days, while he recovered. Frank became more and more depressed, until he finally got to the point that he stopped eating. He was transferred to the psych ward where he spent seven weeks. WebBoards never funded. When Frank was finally released, he thought about starting his life over. He also had Chinese dinner with Emily, and it wasn't long after that that they fell in love. And, as for Josh, well, let's save that story for another night. (moans and groans) Honey? You okay? - The curry worked! Oh, it's time! - Okay! (cries out) Okay, let's get you dressed, okay, that's yours. Okay, okay baby, everything's fine. Keep breathing, let's get you dressed. - Oh shit! - Okay, okay, what is it? - This is gonna be a home birth, Jack! - Don't say that, it's gonna be okay! (cries out) - Mom, are you okay? - Alright, come here, son, talk to your mom. (phone beeps) Come on, Jeff. Jeff. Hey, hey, it's happening! (laughs) Yeah, it's happening. Come on, okay, alright bud. Okay! Okay, let's get you dressed, sweetie. - What about me? - [Parents] You go get dressed! - Go get dressed! Where are your slippers, where are your slippers? - [Lynn] I don't want to wear slippers. - Okay, you don't have to wear them. - Okay. - Okay, okay, okay! (screams) Alright, you stay in there, you hear me? I'm your father talking, I'm telling you to stay in there. (door buzzes) - Hey, sweetie. - [Danny] She's in the bedroom. (moaning) - [Emily] How you doin'? - Fine, but I don't think we're gonna make it. - Hi, beautiful, how close are they? - Every few minutes. - Can I ride up front? - If it's okay with Jeff and Emily. - Why not. My wife might even let you use the siren. - I could use some company. - Cool! - Danny, give mommy a kiss. Alright, wear your seat belt. I think this is the first time I've seen you in uniform. - Pretty sexy, huh? (funky music) (screams) (grunts) (groans) - [Jeff] How are things at the diner, Jack? - It's not a diner. - Oh, that's right, Internet cafe. - There's a difference. - They both sell coffee. - Yeah, well, we don't do fries, okay? - You know, to be perfectly honest, I forgot you were in a classy establishment. - So, how's our old friend Stanley? - You never liked Stanley. - Well, as I recall, neither did you. Although you did like his money. - Are you two ever gonna stop? Enough is enough, just let me have my baby in peace. - I am taking some of your advice, though. - Really, you're taking some of my advice? - I'm turning lemons into lemonade. - Did I say that? (screams) - [Jack] Alright, baby. I think it's just gas.
