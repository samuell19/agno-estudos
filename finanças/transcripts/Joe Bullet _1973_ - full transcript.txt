>> There are only a few minutes to go in the second half of this Cup final match between Falcons and Eagles, and still there is no score. Jerry have the ball and make a magnificent run on the win. Oh, what a player this man, Jerry, is. Last year, he was playing for the Falcon but changed to the Eagles at the beginning of the season. Since then, he has been their highest goal scorer. Jerry Santos. It is taken by Ralph, but is robbed by Bennett. Taken by Jackson for Falcons but saved by goalie block! The Falcons are now or never, and Santos to Ross. But it's swiped by Clarke. He gives the ball to Bennett. Bennett to Ross, shoots, but the goal is saved by goalie! of the Eagles! The ball is now on the loose player on the other side of the field. There can be many minutes left in this game, and it must be well into an Eagles volley. Oh, what a magnificent save by goalie Brown. The play's fast and furious, around the Falcon's goal, but Eagles just can't make it! And that was the final whistle for this Cup tie. There will have to be a replay. Just listen to the crowd. >> * Joe Bullet * Joe Bullet * He's the man * A man who fights evil * He's the man * The man who fights crime * He's the man * No one can tie down * He's the man * That criminals fear * He's the man * That you can't get near * He's the man * That money can't buy * Beware * if he's looking for you * For pity * is the last thing you'll get * He'll hunt you night and day until he finds your hideaway * * Bullet * Joe Bullet [ Whistle blowing ] >> Hello, Lucas. >> Hello, Mr. Poko. >> How are things going? >> Meet my friend, Rockey, a football fan and very interested in the Eagles. >> How do you do? >> How do you do? It is not often I have a chance to watch a team training. But, uh, Mr. Poko invited me over. >> You're welcome. >> That was a very good game last Saturday, Lucas. But I think the boys will have to put in a little more effort if we are to win the cup. >> The boys are training hard. Just watch that ball control. Jerry and Flash are the backbone of the team. Jerry's 66 and Flash is triple one. Just watch them play. >> I don't want to interfere with your work, Lucas. But as president of the club, I must say what I think. It seems to me they ought to play more like a team. They're inclined to be all individuals. Get them to pass the ball more often and not dribble around until they lose it. >> That's exactly what I'm trying to do. Excuse me. I won't be long. >> All right. >> What are you chances for the cup? >> Come and meet the man it depends on. >> Can I get a picture? >> Not at the moment. >> Let me have one picture with you, Flash, and Jerry. >> Well, okay. Come, you two. Come and have your picture taken. [ Camera clicking ] >> Uh, could you give me an idea of your training methods? >> No more time. >> Please, my readers are very interested in the Eagles. >> Could I have your autograph, sir? And you, sir, please? >> It is only my job, after all. >> Where is Mr. Lucas? >> Over there, son. >> There you are, son. >> No, no, no, no. I have no more time. Come on, you guys. Back to it. >> Aah! [ Groans ] >> Hurry, hurry. Let's get away from here. [ Toilet flushes ] >> * Joe Bullet [ Indistinct singing ] >> Are you sure your scheme will work? >> I have done it before. >> You find a football team that depends on two or more players, like the Eagles. You bet heavily on the opponent then bribe the players to change sides. >> And if they won't be bribed? >> Eliminate them. Simple, isn't it? [ Pool balls break ] >> I have reason to believe the Eagles need a new trainer. >> Well done, Sonny. Well done. I want those guys back with the Falcons by next week. If not, get rid of them. >> I'll hang around and wait for you, Joe. >> I won't be long. >> Okay, Joe. >> Hi, Joe. >> Hi, Flash. >> We need your help. >> I've heard about Lucas. No sign of the killer, I suppose? >> Unh-unh. But I know who's behind it. >> Who did it? >> The Vulture Gang. >> The Vultures? >> You know, last year, when Jerry and I left the Falcons to play for Eagles, we were threatened. I'm sure it's them. >> And now they're meeting the Falcons for the cup final. Are they still bothering you? >> No, not the team, but the gang handler. You see, they want us to join the Falcons. So they can win the cup final. >> And you want me to keep them off your backs? >> Please, Joe. And you can help with training. >> Hey. Anything else you want me to do? >> Please, Joe. Until the cup final. >> Okay, Flash. I'll do it. But you better win the cup. >> Thanks, Joe. Thanks. [ Telephone ringing ] >> Dan Poko speaking. >> How are you, Mr. Poko? >> Very well, thanks. Who's that? >> That's not important. Listen carefully. This is our final warning. We want Flash and Jerry to join the Falcons before the cup final. >> What you talking about? You must be crazy. They are our best. >> Exactly. >> Impossible. >> Lucas refused our offer. And you are next. >> Lucas? This whole thing is ridiculous. I am not prepared to discuss it any longer. Who are you? >> You've had your chance. Don't regret it. >> Hello? Hello? >> What's wrong, dear? >> I'm in serious trouble. I think I better go and warn Joe. Go get the car. [ Gunshot ] >> [ Screams ] >> What the?! Are you all right? >> Yes. Let's go before they come back. >> That's gate number two. That's the one Flash and Jerry always use. >> Leave me alone! >> How long you'll get, Jerry. Three things. Get back to the Falcons. [ Whistle blows ] >> All fours. >> One, two, one, two, one, two. >> Flash. >> Get the boys out of sight of the field. >> Why? >> Don't ask questions now. Do it, man. Do it at once. Do it. >> Okay. >> That way, that way. >> Get to the car. Get to the car, quick. >> What's wrong? >> Joe Bullet saw. Joe Bullet saw me. He's coming. >> Don't worry. He'll never catch us in this car. >> Blow the whistle for me and keep them over the other side. >> Better go and tell the boss. Bullet is working with the Eagles. >> What happens now? They could really get us on our way home. >> Mm. You guys have to stick together from now on. >> Hey. I've got a place right out of town. >> Sounds great. Could we use it? >> Certainly. >> Hey, you guys. Get your clothes together and get over to the president's place, okay? >> I'll visit you're farm one evening. Good luck with your new training quarters. >> You know you're always welcome, Rockey. [ Men singing ] >> There he goes. [ Singing continues ] >> Where are they? >> Oh, please. I'm an old man. They -- they gave me money to drive to the farm. >> Are they still at the stadium? >> I don't know. They went along the main road. >> Let him go. [ Engine starts ] >> [ Laughing ] [ Tires screech ] >> Seal. >> What are you doing back here? Did he get away? Answer me! >> Yes. >> [ Coughs ] Did you hear that, Sonny? They got away. >> Well, the cards will tell. If it's black, you get a beating. If it's red, make it quick. Take it. Take it. The carpet, Sonny. The carpet. Take him outside. [ Explosion ] >> [ Laughs ] [ Explosion ] [ Laughs ] >> Watch out. Get out quickly! Joe! Get us out, quick! >> Joe Bullet. Let's move. >> Joe! There they go! >> [ Screams ] Help! Help! >> Beauty! >> Help! Help! >> Hold on, Beauty. Hold on. >> Are you all right? >> [ Groans ] >> Joe will get them. >> Who is your leader? Tell me! Who is your leader? Tell me! >> I'm sorry you've failed. The reason why Lucas was killed was to set an example. The attack on the president was only to alarm them. When the threats at the stadium were ignored, it was necessary to act against the president seriously. But thanks to Joe Bullet, everything has come to nothing. Joe Bullet must be eliminated. I have no intention of failing because of one man. There is a man named Spike Robbins who is a hired killer. Phone him at the gym. He'll be there now doing his karate exercises. >> [ Breathes deeply ] [ Grunts ] [ Telephone ringing ] >> Hello? >> May I speak to Spike? >> Speaking. >> Spike. Sonny here. >> Listen, Spike. I have something in your line of business. Are you interested? >> Who is it? >> Joe Bullet. >> I'm not interested. >> The reward will be high. Come on, Spike. What do you say? >> 10 grand. Nothing less. >> 10 grand? Okay. I'll come and see you tonight. >> Tonight. >> Ah, don't get up, my boy. Just take it easy. Easy, now. You seem to have had a lucky break after tangling with Joe Bullet. But you made it, and I'm glad. How you escaped, I don't know. Sonny thought you'd copped it. He was wrong. Must have been tough. >> He caught me. >> Yeah, Sonny told me. He also said you put up a fight, enabling him to make his getaway. I hope he appreciates that. I like people in my organization to show spirit. It is almost a sure sign that you can rely on them. Trust them. And when one does things beyond the call of duty, I think it should be well rewarded. >> [ Screams ] >> [ Singing in native language ] [ Telephone ringing ] >> Hello? Joe Bullet here. Hello? [ Chimes ringing ] >> [ Singing in native language ] [ Singing continues ] >> Yes. Yes. But there's no doubt. With boys like Flash and Jerry, we can't lose. I've told you before. >> Come on, Jerry. Let's go into the dining room. >> Why do women change so much? >> What do you mean, Jerry? >> You know, one minute I think I've got you, girl. And then the next thing, another guy comes along. >> You mean Joe? >> I was your man, Beauty. Now suddenly it's Joe Bullet. >> I don't think Joe really cares about me. >> But you wish he did. >> Yes. I do. >> Hi, Jerry. >> She's all yours, lover boy. >> That's what the man said, lover, boss. >> Hi, Bennett. You enjoying yourself? That's good, man. >> Hi, folks. >> Hi, Joe. How's the training going? >> Well, um, that's a good question. In good shape for the cup final. But, uh, they lack spirit. >> Spirits? That's what I need right now. [ Laughter ] Come on, Lillian. >> I organized this party just for that reason. >> Yes. But you must be very careful. These boys mean business. How did they know we were working at the farm? >> I don't know. But it's very strange. Enjoying yourself? >> What's wrong with Jerry? You his girlfriend or something? >> Not really, Joe. I like him. But, uh, no sparks fly. >> I see. >> Why so glum? Come on, cheer up, man, and let's enjoy the party. >> I've got nothing to cheer up about. I'm still getting threats. I feel like joining the Falcons, and I'd prefer it. >> We're the greatest, boy. Look, we're a team. Remember, we got Joe Bullet behind us. >> We can talk about one guy and his whole gang. They get him in the end. >> But that's the only way, Jerry, and you know it. >> I'd rather play for the Falcons and stay alive. What's more, there's the money in it. >> Aw, come on, man. They'll never kill you. They just want you to kick the ball and score more goals for them. >> Kick the ball and score more goals. Then what about Lucas? >> Oh, well, he was merely a trainer. >> Glad to see you, Flash. [ Telephone ringing ] >> Joe, I'm worried about the death of Lucas. And now they've blown up my dam. What next? >> Don't worry about that. I'll organize a bulldozer next week to repair the damage. >> You mean it? >> Tell me, Rockey. What's the secret of your success? >> It's simple. It's like a game. As long as you make the first move. >> I've known Rockey for very many years. He used to be professor of zoology, specializing in reptiles. Then he started a sideline business as an excavating contractor. He's a methodical man and perseveres in everything he does. >> And another thing. I have a lot of patience. And I don't make mistakes. >> No matter how good you are, sooner or later one makes a mistake. >> Not me, boy. I'm too clever. And I don't make mistakes. >> Please cut me another piece of pork, Rockey. >> See you around. >> Okay. [ Chimes ringing ] >> [ Grunts ] [ Tapping ] [ Timer ticking ] [ Ticking continues ] [ Sirens wailing ] >> [ Breathes deeply ] [ Grunts ] [ Telephone ringing ] >> Is that Joe Bullet? >> Speaking. >> You don't know me, Mr. Bullet. My name is Fred. I have important information for you about the bomb in your apartment last night. Will you meet me at the railway station at 9:00? I'll introduce myself. Platform number two, coach number 8681, compartment F. >> 9:00 sharp. Okay, Fred. >> Popeye! You're getting old. Get up! You have a job to do. >> What's cooking this time? >> I want you to go over and make arrangements with Rockey for that bulldozer. If we don't do it now, he may forget it. Come on, get up. >> There's more of them than expected. >> Yeah. >> Tell the president if we do this, it should be ready by the end of this week. That's good for all of us. >> * Joe Bullet * Joe Bullet * He's the man * The man who fights evil * He's the man * The man who fights crime * He's the man * No one can tie down * He's the man * That criminals fear * He's the man * That you can't get near * He's the man * That money can't buy * Beware * If he's lookin' for you * For pity * Is the last thing you'll get * He'll hunt you night and day until he finds your hideaway * * Joe Bullet * Joe Bullet * You will see * That giant of a man * You will hear * The fire in his voice * You will feel * The touch of his hand * He'll shoot you so * You'll never forget * Moments of terror * You'll always regret * He rights the wrong * And keeps it that way * Beware * If he's lookin' for you * For pity * Is the last thing you'll get * He'll hunt you night and day until he finds your hideaway * [ Train chugging ] >> Aah! >> [ Grunts ] >> [ Grunting ] >> * Joe Bullet * Joe Bullet * Joe Bullet * Joe Bullet * Joe Bullet * Joe Bullet * Joe Bullet >> I'm worried. Three days before the cup final. If the gang is going to move, they'll do it today. Want you to mix with the crowd and keep your eyes open. If you see anything suspicious, please let me know. >> Okay, Joe. >> I'm meeting Flash and Jerry at Gate 2. >> Okay. >> Hey, we're lucky we missed the pass. >> Yes, it was a tough match. >> It was. Hi, Jerry. I'm gonna keep my stuff here. >> Sure. >> Thanks. Say, uh, Horatio? Will you tell Joe to meet us outside Gate number 2? >> Yes. >> We're waiting for Beauty. Come on, Jerry. >> Come quick! Beauty's had an accident. She's in the ambulance. We're taking her to the hospital. Go. Go away. You better hurry. Get in, please. >> Have any one of you seen Flash and Jerry? >> They're meeting Beauty at Gate number 2. Hold this. >> Look. If I'm not back before the cup final, tell the manager to use Torres as your right. >> What? >> Nothing wrong. But see that you win the cup, huh? Right. >> Don't worry. We will. Now listen, you guys, there's nothing to worry about. >> Have you seen Flash and Jerry? >> No. Not anywhere. No. >> Thank you. Where's Flash? >> In the ambulance outside. >> Come, boy. Come and show me. You know, Popeye, the position is serious. The president has lost his daughter and the team their best players. Unless we find them, the Eagles don't stand a chance in the cup final tomorrow. If only we could find out who is their leader. This corruption in sport must stop. Look, Popeye. Are you sure you have never seen this sign before? It's a D with a lightning flash going through it. Now are you sure this means nothing to you? >> It seems to ring a bell. >> It does? >> I've seen it. I know I've seen it. I know where I've seen it. >> Are you sure? >> I'm afraid so. >> Do you know where they are? >> I don't know. Ambulance took off before we got to the car. >> They might have gone down to the old mine. The place is heavily guarded. You can't just walk in there by yourself. >> I know the place. But you've got to be a bird to get in there. >> Hey, you've given me an idea. Let's go. >> Hey, wait a minute. There it is. >> Now just remember, count 10 then pull the cord, all right? Count 10 and pull the cord, Popeye. >> I can't! I can't! >> Oh, you can do it. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. >> [ Screams ] [ Chickens bawking ] [ Chickens bawking ] >> This way, Popeye. This way. [ Goats bleating ] >> You try that way. >> [ Grunts ] >> [ Grunts ] >> Think you can work it out? >> I can't take much more of this. >> They're going to kill Beauty if you don't play for the Falcons. >> It's built like a bank here. We'll never get out. >> Hadn't you better play for them? I mean, these guys might kill Beauty if -- >> Don't kid yourself! Step out of it, Jerry. They'll never let it go, whether we play or not. >> Okay. Okay. I only hope Joe Bullet manages to find us. >> Hey, you guys. Talking about me again. >> Joe? >> Come here, come here. >> Stand well away from the door. I'll try and break it down, okay? Right. [ Engine rumbling ] >> Hey, hey. Get out of here. >> Grab the car and get to the stadium. And don't worry, I'll get Beauty. And you win that match for us. [ Engine starts ] >> Cheer up, honey. It won't be long. >> Leave me alone. >> Over. >> Joe Bullet is here with the other men. The footballers have escaped. >> What? What? Ahh. Sonny? Sonny? >> Yes. >> That Bullet bastard is here. >> We better hurry. Help me to move her forward. >> Attention. Two strangers have entered our premises. I want the big one alive, bring him to my office. >> Ha! >> [ Grunts ] >> Aah! Aah! [ Punches landing ] >> Are you all right, Popeye? [ Door creaks ] [ Knocks on door ] >> [ Grunting ] >> Popeye. Popeye. >> And here at the stadium, the Falcons take the field for the cup final replay against the Eagles. It will be a very interesting match, as I understand that Flash and Jerry, the Eagles' best players, may very well be absent today. [ Tires screech ] >> Where the hell you been? [ Indistinct conversation ] >> Are we late? >> Yes, you are. >> Where the hell is Joe? >> Look, don't worry about Joe. We must just win this game. >> No! What a surprise! The Eagles take the field, and there is Flash and Jerry! >> I'm going to have to kill you. >> No. Please. >> [ Laughs ] >> Don't! >> I wouldn't do that. >> Let her go! You made a mistake this time, Rockey. >> Pass me that toy, now. >> No. No. Oh. [ Crying ] >> [ Laughs ] .32. Junk! [ Laughing ] >> No, no, no, no, Sonny, please. Please, Sonny. Leave him. Leave him. He's mine, Sonny. I want him to die slowly. [ Laughs ] [ Grunts ] >> No. No. >> Tie him up. Tie him up. I'll keep these as a little souvenir. Search him well. This guy's full of surprises. [ Laughing ] Is this the great hero? [ Laughing ] Sonny, run to the airport for the plane. Tell them we want to get out of here immediately. Get up the tower for -- for better reception. Hurry. >> I never trusted you, you rotten pig. But we both make mistakes. >> Shut up, you fool. I could have killed you much earlier. Only I want to have my fun before I leave. >> Leave? >> Yes. In 4 hours time, I will be across the border, safe, sound and rich and -- and a beautiful girl to keep me company. Bitch! >> [ Screams ] >> Don't ever try that again. I could've given you everything, Beauty. >> Don't. >> If only you'd listened to me. >> No. Leave him alone. Leave him alone! Aah! No! No! Please. >> You don't want me? Nobody interferes with my business and lives. You want him? You can have him. But not alive. >> Don't. No. No! >> I'll show you something that can spit, baby. [ Laughs ] My little beauty. [ Laughing ] Egyptian spitting cobra, the same pet that killed your brother. It is not alone from the deadliness and his almost hysterical disposition that the present reptile have got notoriety, but he also has the most virulent poison of all snakes. The Egyptian cobra might well be termed the most sensational, viper -- neo-toxic. It can strike at any moving object, faster than the mamba, aims accurately, can spit accurately, can kill a man in 5 minutes, even the great Joe Bullet. [ Laughing ] [ Snake hisses ] [ Laughing ] So long, Mr. Bullet. >> Joe. Joe. >> Don't move, Beauty. Keep still. Don't move. >> Don't. >> Use this. I'll kill that bastard with my bare hands. >> Careful, Joe. >> Now only a few minutes to go in this cup final replay. Oh, what a magnificent match. No score so far. These teams are so evenly matched that anything could happen. The Falcons gather around as Ross changes his shirt, which got torn in that last exchange. And then Poko, the president of the Eagles, take the opportunity of having a final word with the team. And there's go the whistle, and the play's on. Still no score in one of the toughest matches we've seen on this ground. The Falcons are playing a tremendous game, but just can't break through the Eagles' defense. Time and again, they are stopped just when they are ready to take the ball through. Flash passes to Jerry, who boots the ball well upfield to Ross. Cross back to Flash, who runs through. Shoots, but then the ball is stopped by goalie Brown. He had a chance this time for a moment, but was robbed by Bennett. Now the play is very red and developing into two-man duels. Why doesn't Baker pass? He has lost it. It's taken by Ross, who passes it to Flash. Flash runs up the wing. What a magnificent run! There's nobody who can get it. He's holding it well into the Falcons' half. The crowd cheers and is going mad. He steadies himself and shoots. It's a goal! Goal! [ Cheers and applause ] [ Whistle blows ] And that was the final whistle. The Eagles have won by one goal to nil. And this was a magnificent match by the Eagles in sudden death. [ Indistinct announcing ] And by winning this game, the Eagles have proved to be this year's champion of games. And now, once again, back to the studios. >> I lost my money. My money. >> Come on, Rockey, hurry! I've got contact. Come on! >> We must get out of here, Sonny. Come on! Let's go. Let's go. Now give me that thing. Come on! >> I've got contact. Please hurry. >> Calling Delta Zulu Juliet. This is two one two decimal five, over. Calling Delta Zulu Juliet. This is zero one zero red. Calling Delta Zulu Juliet. This is zero one zero red, two one two decimal five, over. Calling Delta Zulu Juliet. This is zero one zero red, two one two decimal five, over. >> Come in, zero one zero red, over. >> Get the plane ready in one hour. We're leaving for headquarters. Over and out. >> [ Speaks indistinctly ] >> Impossible. My god. If only I'd brought that gun. Impossible. My god. We've got to kill him! Go and get him, Sonny. >> [ Grunting ] >> [ Panting ] [ Metal scraping ] [ Footsteps approaching ] >> [ Laughing ] >> You'll have to pass me to get down. That's why -- that's why I'm going to kill you.
