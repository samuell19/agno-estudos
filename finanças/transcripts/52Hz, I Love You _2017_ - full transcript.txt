With long hair and a free personality? No, he's about the age of my father And his mustache tickles me when he kisses me. -Failed. -Kisses you? You've already thought of that? You don't understand. The mustache is useful in flirting. No. He smokes and his mouth stinks. What about that handsome young man? With a cute butt and an eye-catching look? No, I don't like his hairstyle He looks like a snob Harassing girls like a fly. Failed. Like a fly? Then you're the dog shit. No, I'm a flower. A beautiful rose. How about a strong driver? He has strong arms for his lover You can get a sense of security from him Oh, my! Open your eyes! Haven't you seen that huge tummy of his? From this angle, he looks like... A tadpole! Disgusting! Hey, careful. No, I'm fine. I'm totally fine. Yeah, you're late for school. Go on! Bye-bye! Hey, wake up! He's just a little boy. And you're way over 30. No, I'm 33!

Girls always trouble themselves with love We're picky before we say yes But we're paranoid after it Always remembering who makes us say yes As long as you try harder To tolerate My self-indulgence and paranoia I'll ignore it When you become bald or fat Come to me, my Mr. Right I'll definitely hold you tight Despite all the difficulties I'll keep on Looking for love -Who are you? -You cockroach! Why did you fly in here to scare us? No, I walked through the front door. -What flying cockroach? -I'm afraid of cockroaches! -I'm not a cockroach. -What do you want? I want flowers. I'm a customer. Where are your manners? Why are you shouting? Hey? What flowers do you want? You're not happy today. I guess you don't have a lover. You're disgusting! You're a failure! At least a flying cockroach is indigenous to Taiwan. -Why am I a failure? -Give it back! You're so humble. A pink cockroach is a world heritage. What do you want? Come on! We're busy.

A cockroach will never understand me. Give us five minutes to wrap your flowers up. Yeah, five minutes. Enough for me to sing a song. -Background music! -That guitar is for display only. One of the strings is missing. If you really know how to play it, you don't care how many strings it has. Lights! What lights?

Fine. Never mind. I've got to go. Hey! You kept saying that you love her, but I'm wondering... Does she love you? Of course! I think that his parents are both optimistic. A big umbrella for the stereo! Here it is! MAY EVERY JACK HAVE HIS JILL Why is it sunny and raining At the same time? Is it a hint? How can the two parallels Meet at some point? It's an inharmonic beauty Sunshine dyes the rain golden Just like you put a rainbow in my eyes Love is both sunny and raining You think it foolish to walk in the rain Love is both sunny and raining But I'm only smart enough to love you Why is it sunny and raining At the same time? Is it a hint? The two parallels meet again What a contradiction The rain rids the sun of its glory Just as you make a girl Afraid of the future Love is a multiple choice question Whether it's right or wrong You think it a good thing Love is a multiple choice question But is it good to you? Or to me? Above the clouds, it's forever sunny During the monsoon, it's endlessly cloudy If we have to choose a place To settle down Will it be my optimism? Or my pessimism? Love is both sunny and raining It makes the strange familiarity And familiar strangeness Intertwine so beautifully But it's illogical for the dark cloud To fall in love with the blue sky But when the blue sky Falls in love with the dark cloud It'll stop raining soon It stopped raining. Come on, the rain stopped. The sun and the rain don't belong together. Love is powerful indeed. Hey, Lei! Have you checked the remote for balloons? Yeah, it's good! Lei? What? They didn't register, but they're here. I'm sorry, but I can't allow you to join them. Why not? All we want is to be a part of it. It's not about joining or not. This is a legal wedding ceremony. They'll be husbands and wives by law. But our law hasn't approved your... We're not here for your approval. We want everyone's blessing. It was not easy for us to find each other. Please give us your blessing. I guess... When you're in love with your boyfriend, you'd want others' blessings too, right? Yeah. Do you have a boyfriend? What does that have to do with this? I'm sorry. You can't register. But I'll put you in the middle of the first row for you to receive the greatest blessing. Is that good enough? Hello? Yes, sir. Everything's okay, but I need to confirm it. Yeah. In an hour? Okay. Yeah, all right. Thank you! Yeah. Good. Bye. A bit bitter and a bit sweet Is that the taste of love? When she's the wind In love with the summer I'm the ocean disturbed by her in June Drinking seawater makes me thirsty I'm waiting with tears, sweet and bitter Salty? You've added seawater and tears to the chocolate. Who is the girl? Is she in your imagination? I've told you. She's the wind in love with the summer. So she doesn't even know that you love her? If she's the June wind In love with the summer You should be the anemoscope That blesses her I'm a whale searching for What the wind wants in the sea But her love is so picky You can make a nice dough With the best butter Salt, sugar, flour and milk But you can't force The taste buds of love We don't have much time to create your love today. Come and help with the mass production of love. Hey, Ang... I used to be exactly like you when I was young. Every morning when I woke up, I wanted to make the best bread for my wife. But I don't have a wife. How can I be like you? Then she fell ill and died. Life was difficult for a few years. The bread I made was hard as rock. It didn't taste bad, but it had no taste at all. Then one day when I was making bread, I thought of her smile. She smiled at me and I smiled at her. She kept smiling at me and I kept smiling at her. And you know what? The bread I made that day tasted better than any other bread. I used the same recipe, but it tasted really good. -Aren't you surprised? -No. The bread in cartoons can even sing. I'm remembering my wife. What are you talking about? How many loaves of bread have you made? Always with the same smile on your mind? Sometimes... Sometimes, someone else would smile at me. Love is sweet and so is yearning. But too much love or yearning makes your heart heavy. Yeah, I know. Make it a little more bitter. But it's difficult to give up the unrequited love and wish them happiness. If she's the June wind In love with the summer Just wish her happiness sincerely. It's weird. I've never been in love, but why do I feel lovelorn? A bit bitter and a bit sweet Is that the taste of love? I learn how to play the guitar With the hands that make desserts Hopefully the music that I write Sounds like summer too And when she hears my song She'd feel happy also Maybe by the end of this summer She'll know my hesitation MAY EVERY JACK HAVE HIS JILL To dream or to face reality It's a dilemma she's in She can have love But she can't afford it Before your lover says "I do" You have to ask her first He's waiting for the right time To make a promise But he waits Until he has enough savings He always has two helmets with him Waiting for a possibility But in the heavy traffic Who will wait For a whale swimming slowly? She's afraid that the roses Might be out of bloom soon Like a cat, careful and cautious But modern people want love And curse it at the same time My love comes and goes But I'm afraid that I'm not good enough My love comes and goes But I'm afraid That I won't be naive forever My love comes and goes But I'm afraid that There's no Mr. Right for me My love comes and goes But I'm afraid that She doesn't mean she and I When she says "us" So what's wrong, love? You come to us But we're scared with you So what's wrong, love? You leave us But we're lonely without you To be happy is all we want To be approved is all we need The gate of love We can neither get in nor out of it Love comes and goes It comes and goes again So what's wrong, love? You come to us But we're scared with you So what's wrong, love? You leave us But we're lonely without you To be happy is all we want To be approved is all we need The gate of love We can neither get in nor out of it Love comes and goes It comes and goes again Hey! Hey! Would you please rehearse my song? It's an important evening for me. But, Da-he, we're performing at 7:30, while in your text to us, you said 6:30? But I've made a reservation. Give us a break. No one sings in a restaurant at 6:30. You can propose to her after you finish dinner. Yeah. But it's not how I want it to be. We'll do it at 7:30. Listen, if you propose to her at 6:30, it's awkward. But if you do it at 7:30, it's great! -7:30. -What's the difference? Forget it. I don't understand you musicians' logic. 7:30 it is. -Hey! I don't need it. -You've memorized the lyrics? Of course! I wrote them. Don't forget to ask me to sing on stage. You're not the one who wrote them. Don't steal my song again. And I'll bring my own guitar. Keep that in mind. Hey! I'm proposing, not fighting a battle. I need something romantic. MAY EVERY JACK HAVE HIS JILL What the hell? Hey! What are you doing? Do me a favor. My feet... Pull my feet. -I can't get out. -What the hell? Get down! You didn't watch where you were going. Didn't you see my van? You bumped into it without braking. -But I was going straight. -Excuse me! It's not much to look at. Get out of here! Let us deal with it. Stop taking photos, okay? Please. Thanks a lot. -What are you going to do? -What? Me? You drove a van and I rode a scooter. Whose fault was it? It was your fault. You bumped into my van. You have to take the responsibility. You'll pay to get my van fixed. -What? -Yes, you will. And... I can't make deliveries before my van is fixed. You're going to make up for it. What? What are you looking at? Do you want me to call the police? Yeah, call them. Let them decide who's right or wrong. You were sitting in the van without a scratch while I flew away when you bumped into me. And you don't wanna know if I'm fine. You look pretty, but you're so cruel. Well... Do I really look pretty? Have you only heard what you wanna hear? Flower shop... XIN FLOWER SHOP So you make deliveries too. Are you okay? I think I'm fine. You're delivering others' love too? Yeah, everything's fine. But I'm not! -Are you happy? -Yes! -Are you blessed? -Yes! -Are you in love? -Yes! Good.

We have lots of customers. Everyone is busy. I have to stay here. And these are extra deliveries. We want the money, don't we? But I've made everything for you in just two days. Whose idea was it to sell chocolate on Valentine's Day? Mine. And you want me to make deliveries? Why are you watering the flowers at noon? Stop pretending to work hard! The god of love shoots an arrow And it hits the heart of a young girl Her heart's beating fast When eating the candy made of love The god of love shoots an arrow And it hits the heart of a young boy He falls in love and gives her flowers It's never too late For them to meet each other We're lonely when we're growing up But we grow up to rid ourselves Of being lonely Even Cupid needs love too I wanna be held in your arms Even if one is changeable and selfish Only he knows how to love somebody Even Cupid needs love too I want you to indulge me But Cupid is a god. -Does a god need love? -Of course. A god may not need bread, but he'll be lonely without love. I'm glad that we're ordinary people. We want love and bread too. Or our chocolate wouldn't have so many sales. -Right? -All right. You deserve to have both love and bread. Let's go for the last deliveries. Damn! I really want to work overtime. I'm sad with love And even sadder without it And I've tried hard to hang on to it If in your search you come up empty-handed Why don't you act crazy with me? What will it be next? Love always makes us nervous We're born to be torn apart It's the unforgettable part of love Red light! You did it on purpose. No, I didn't. It's green. This is my stop. It's mine too. Will you break my heart? No, I won't. Taipei 101. Taipei 101. It's Valentine's Day. Give love a second chance. Try harder, you lonely people. Yeah. We haven't eaten anything today. Because you bumped into my van. Yeah. It was my fault. Let's eat. What's the rush? Do you have a date? No. Do you? Mind your own business. Listen... When my van is fixed, you'll have to treat me. To what? What do you want? I want French. These are mine, so you owe me two. Here. What? Take them. Oh, no. I didn't ride it yesterday and it won't start? Damn you, Taipei! Why am I too scared to break my guitar? I've been waiting I've been waiting I've been waiting for ten years I've waited And I'm still waiting But it's not too late to give up now If I give you up now At least I can save the exhausted me Love, I no longer believe in Now I'm ready to leave It's too late It's too late Zero the timer to stop our love forever The tragedy will be no more Lei! The show will be on at 7:30 Give me a G To our love, I'm singing When the music's on, you'll know that Everything's fine if you're with me It's not too late It's not too late I'm on time, believe me I haven't showed up on time So I'll never be on time to leave What do you want to eat? It's your treat. You decide. Me? Okay. Let me order you... A set meal of the best rib eye steak. -As for me... -Wait a second. What? Do you like it? Or do you prefer the Australian classic... Any set meal costs more than NT$3,000. Why are we here? Are you crazy? It's all right. I have money. These two set meals and a bottle of red wine. Wait. Excuse me. Leave us the menu. We'll have coffee. -Thank you. -No, it's okay. Go ahead and place our order. Thank you. Sit down. Da-he. Do you know how much your order costs? It's my weekly wage! Come on. It's Valentine's Day. And for you, it's worth it. Don't worry. I have money. You have money? Then why don't you make our life easier? I don't give a damn about this dinner. Don't be mad. In half an hour, I'll sing a song for you and tell you a secret. I've waited ten years for you. Half an hour more won't kill me. -Lei... -Can your stupid secret make my life a lot easier? Don't worry, Lei. I'll pay by credit card. Credit card? You've squandered away my youth and my everything! It'll be my credit card, not yours. I'll pay from now on. Stop crying. They're looking at us. What's the big deal? You have the courage to sing in front of them, but you're afraid of me crying here? In order to be with you, to help you fulfill your great music fantasy... -Dream. -It's a fantasy! For your daydream and my dream of having a family, how much time and money have I spent? What about you? How much money have you earned? You've never earned over NT$9,000 with selling instruments and renting out the practice room. -No, it's true. -And you spent NT$5,000 for this shirt. Are you Pink Panther? I can't go on like this anymore. But, Lei... I've had some success. I'm not waiting for the roses. And I'm not waiting for 7:30. I'll tell you my first secret now. The international music award... -To hell with you and your music. -But I won first prize. -I won! -It's none of my business! So... So the home I want is but an illusion created by myself. So I've built a castle to lock myself up in it. If you love me... If you really love me, why didn't you get me out? I can't believe our last deliveries are to the same restaurant. What a coincidence. It's so unique and pretty. How much is it? I want one too. "How much"? It's someone else's love. What's wrong with you? I know. Valentine's Day will be over soon, so you're sad, aren't you? What are you talking about? Lei, I know I'm late, and I'm really sorry. But every song I wrote, I wrote it for you. I have a song. I'll sing it now. I'll get you out with it. Please... Please don't. You can't get me out even if you kill yourself. I know I'm not somebody. But as long as I have a guitar, I can write songs of my love to you because I'm telling the world with my music... that I love you. Do you understand, Lei? I love you, you know? Happy Valentine's Day, Lei. Hi, Mr. Cockroach. My love is not that great. I've had enough after ten years. -I'm breaking up with you. -Let's get married, Lei. -Let's get married. -Go away! -Lei! -Lei? Lei! You know the girl, right? And you like her. I heard you call her Lei, not Miss. Happy Valentine's Day. I'll take care of the flowers. -But it's not... -Please. Have a seat. Thank you. Thank you. Enjoy the meal. Happy Valentine's Day. I was speeding But before the red light I stopped How many heartbreaks Before meeting true love? Where do I start this long story? If we've crossed the starting point Can we talk about love on the way? You're different From those billions of people You've shown up and it's destiny We're destined to meet each other I've lost one half of my soul And I find it in your eyes It is love Hi, I'm Ang. I'm 31. And you? I'm Xin. We're two years apart. I'm 29. Lei! Lei! Before you finish counting the stars Don't be distracted You've got to ten Why don't you keep counting? Where do I start this long story? If I no longer yearn for tomorrow, Can we stop While the night is still beautiful? You've locked up the door That should be open for me You and I both have the key Let's be together to do everything I can't guarantee How good your life will be In a black hole, light will always be seen Leaving me troubled Fold a thin piece of paper countless times And it'll be so thick That it reaches the moon Where do I start this long story? You can't practice love With an opportunity We're partners It takes two people To sing a song beautifully I bought this ring for you because I knew you'd give it back to me. What a ridiculous way to get a present. I don't want to be a fool anymore. You can have this ring, but I'm leaving. What? Again? Come on. You're hard to get. You've said what you wanted to say and sung what you wanted to sing. What do I stay here for? That was not what I wanted to sing. Don't worry. I don't blame you for being too romantic. I blame myself for being too naive. No one breaks up on Valentine's Day! You can't do that! Let's start over. Forget everything that has happened. Let's start over from the beginning. This time, we walk together into the restaurant. We walk in together, but there's no table for us. So the manager takes us to the rooftop, the VIP seats for lovers. -What are you doing? -Let's go to the rooftop. -But it's someone's car. -It's not mine anyway. -Stop it! -I don't have a car anyway. But if you like this car, I'll buy you one next month. This time I won't sit across from you. I'm sitting by your side. Let's order two of their cheapest set meals. And look. I've got you this night sky. Look at it. Then I say... I've been in love with you for ten years. Please let me keep on loving you. And you say... You say... I've had enough after ten years. I'm breaking up with you. Forget it. Let's eat. Here are the steaks. This is yours. -And this is mine. -Don't waste your time. I'm determined to break up with you. It's not a sudden whim. I've thought about it for a long time. You're so cruel. You've thought about it for long before breaking up with me. But I'm not ready. It's not fair. Not fair at all. Here's the deal. Let's break up. But I think that love is like a shuttle run. The finish line is the starting point. So breaking up is not the end, but the beginning of our walking back. So you have to walk with me back to the start, back to where we met. What? But I've been with you for ten years. I'll spend another ten years walking back with you? I'll be over 40 years old. Who wants a middle-aged woman? Me. I do. I want you. We'll have enough wisdom to start walking together again. But I'm not stupid. I don't want to start over with you. You can sleep on it. But, Lei... Can I sing you the song that won first prize? I wrote it for you. Sing it if you like. Do, Mi, but no Sol... -Just kidding. Not that one. -Be gentle! Wow, the way you said it... So sexy. You're crazy. In my first ten years I didn't play house with you In my second ten years I played the guitar without you I used to imagine what you'd look like And compare it to the sunshine That I liked But I'd never seen the sweetest summer In my third ten years You showed up like we'd already met You love to smile And I like to joke around with you We walk everywhere side by side You're afraid that Love won't be with us forever So let me change my vows I'll love you for ten years more When we're... What? When we're... Come on! When we're together When we're together We're as happy as we can be When we're together When we're together We're as happy as we can be Good evening. We're The Wonderful Four. We'll be responsible for warming up, opening performance, closing, ending performance and encores. Happy Valentine's Day to all. -It's Valentine's Day? -For the opening performance... -What? You didn't know? -A friend of mine... -Oh, no! -...is proposing to his princess. He's singing her the song that won first prize. Let's hear it for... Mr. You Da-he! Da-he? Mr. You Da-he? Mr. You Da-he... Once. Mr. You Da-he... Twice. Let her decide. Mr. You Da-he? Well, sorry then. In my first ten years I didn't play house with you Hi, Miss. Sell me those flowers, please? But I have my own Valentine. Pretty please? Actions speak louder than words. Call now to order a bouquet. It's not too late. -No, it's too late. -No, it's not. These two... Which one tastes better? They're both delicious. Oh, no! What the hell is this place? It's so expensive. I'll pay. I'll pay. Happy Valentine's Day. -Thank you. -I've come prepared. -I'll take care of it for you. -Okay. Oh, God. NT$100 for a rose? Come on. It's Valentine's Day. Even if you don't have a boyfriend, buy yourself one. -How did you know that I don't... -I've been there before. Here. Be happy even when you're alone. Understand? NT$100. How much longer shall we wait? It's Valentine's Day. Let's wait until you smile. But I've been sitting here with you for so long that I've forgotten how. But they haven't come back. I can't leave, or my sister will kick me out. Well, why don't you move in with me? Let's close up. -It's Valentine's Day, Mommy. -Happy Valentine's Day, baby! Come here! I've missed you so much! Be a good girl and say hello. -Hi, Auntie. -Hi, Olivia. Let's call her "Mommy." -Okay? -But there are two mommies. Then I'm Big Mommy and she's Little Mommy. I know there will be another And yet another ten years When you're too old to walk My hands will still be holding yours When we're together When we're together We're as happy as we can be When we're together When we're together We're as happy as we can be What do you think? Well... So everyone loves a silly love song. What silly love song? I was confessing my love to you. It's a silly love song anyway. When will you be awarded? Next month. But there's only one ticket. I won't go. Come on! I'm serious. I've asked them to mail me the prize money. There's prize money? Of course. It's $30,000. We can buy a house downtown and a car, too. And we can have a child. But $30,000 is a little less than NT$1 million. Or we can pay our debts. That's more like it. But how much do we owe the bank? A little less than NT$1 million. So we'll be back to the start? Great! Back to the start and we can break up. That's not what I meant! All right, already! ...as happy as we can be When we're together When we're together We're as happy as we can be Happy Valentine's Day. Happy Valentine's Day. Thank you! Thank you all! Next up... "Big World, Small World." I hear the sunshine because you're warm I hear the rainbow because of your smile I was wrong to think that my ears Couldn't hear the happiness Then you showed up and my heart beat fast And my voice has a pulse So I've had a big world of love That's deafeningly beautiful But I've never shared it With anyone before Thank you for giving me A small world of love For me to keep quiet loudly Because I don't have to say a thing To make sure that you understand me I hear the flowers blooming Because you pick me I hear the candy sweet Because you kiss me Your whispers in my ears Stop me from being lonely And prove that everyone Will be heard eventually So I've had a big world of love That's deafeningly beautiful But I've never shared it With anyone before Thank you for giving me A small world of love For me to keep quiet loudly Because I don't have to say a thing To make sure that you understand me So I've had a big world of love That's deafeningly beautiful But I've never shared it With anyone before Thank you for giving me A small world of love For me to keep quiet loudly Because I don't have to say a thing To make sure that my dearest you Loves me as well Thank you!
