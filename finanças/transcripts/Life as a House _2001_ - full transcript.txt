WHAT'S IN MY PANTS IS NONE OF YOUR FUCKING BUSINESS! LOOK, I'D SAY YOU'RE IN COMPLIANCE. I HOPE THIS MAKES THE PAIN IN THE ASS THAT CALLED YOU HAPPY. YOU AND ME BOTH. George: BYE! EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU IS MY BUSINESS. WHAT YOU SMOKE, WHAT YOU SNIFF, WHAT YOU SWALLOW-- IT'S ALL MY BUSINESS. I'VE BEEN USING SINCE I WAS 12! YOU'RE ALSO UNBELIEVABLY STUPID. YOU KNOW THAT?

MY DAD USED TO PLAY THIS GAME. I NEVER REALLY EVEN UNDERSTOOD WHAT IT WAS TILL AFTER HE WAS GONE. I WAS HOLDING FOR SOMEBODY ELSE. IT WASN'T EVEN MINE. THE GAME WAS TO MAKE ME SMALLER THAN HE WAS-- SMALLER, ALWAYS SMALLER. NO MATTER WHAT. HE COULD BE ALMOST INVISIBLE AS A HUMAN BEING, BUT I STILL HAD TO BE SMALLER, SO THAT IF I GOT GOOD GRADES IN SCHOOL, THAT I WAS A PUSSY FOR NOT PLAYING FOOTBALL, OR IF I CUT MY HAIR FOR HIM, IT WAS NEVER SHORT ENOUGH, OR IF I SHAVED MY HEAD, THEN I LOOKED LIKE A PSYCHO. I NEVER WON THE GAME. NEVER. AND IF HE COULDN'T MAKE ME SMALLER WITH WORDS... I'LL HAVE TO PAY HIM BACK. SAM... I WON'T EVER HIT YOU... EVER. I DON'T WANT YOU SMALLER. I WANT YOU TO BE HAPPY. YOU'RE NOT. NOT HERE WITH ME, NOT HOME WITH YOUR MOTHER, NOT ALONE, NOT ANYWHERE. YOU'RE WHAT I WAS MOST OF MY LIFE, SAM. I SEE IT IN YOUR EYES, IN YOUR SLEEP, IN YOUR ANSWER TO EVERYTHING. YOU'RE BARELY ALIVE. I'M NOT EVEN LISTENING. YOU KNOW THE GREAT THING, THOUGH? IT'S THAT CHANGE CAN BE SO CONSTANT THAT YOU DON'T EVEN FEEL THE DIFFERENCE UNTIL THERE IS ONE. IT CAN BE SO SLOW THAT YOU DON'T KNOW THAT YOUR LIFE IS BETTER OR WORSE UNTIL IT IS. OR IT CAN JUST BLOW YOU AWAY. MAKE YOU SOMETHING DIFFERENT IN AN INSTANT. IT HAPPENED TO ME. BUILD THIS HOUSE WITH ME. COME ON. FUCK. I HAVE TO PAY BACK WHAT YOU FLUSHED DOWN THE TOILET. I WANT $10 AN HOUR, THEN I'M DONE. THIS ALL HAS TO COME DOWN BEFORE WE CAN START AGAIN. KNOCK IT DOWN. I HAVE HATED THIS HOUSE FROM THE MOMENT MY FATHER PUT IT IN MY NAME. 25 YEARS OF HATING WHAT YOU LIVE IN-- HATING WHAT YOU ARE! THIS IS AN END OF IT, SAM.

I WENT TO MY ROOM. I HELD THE BARREL RIGHT UP TO HIS EAR... AND THEN I CHICKENED OUT AGAIN. 'COURSE, IT WAS A BB GUN, BUT STILL, IT WOULD HAVE HURT LIKE HELL. ARE YOU TALKING? I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT MY MOM. SHE WOULDN'T LEAVE MY DAD. I REMEMBER ONCE SHE MADE DINNER FOR US WEARING SUNGLASSES. MIND YOU, IT WAS DARK OUTSIDE... AND IN. AND NOBODY SAID A THING ABOUT IT. WHY WOULDN'T SHE JUST LEAVE? I THINK SHE WAS TERRIFIED TO LIVE WITH HIM, BUT, UM... MAYBE EVEN MORE TERRIFIED OF LIFE WITHOUT HIM. I WOULD HAVE KILLED HIM. WOULD HAVE BEEN SO MUCH BETTER IF YOU HAD. THEN MAYBE HE WOULDN'T HAVE DRIVEN DRUNK... MAYBE HE WOULDN'T HAVE KILLED MY MOM IN THE CAR CRASH... THE WOMAN IN THE OTHER CAR... HURT A LITTLE GIRL IN THE BACKSEAT, TOO. YOU WOULD HAVE LIKED YOUR GRANDMOTHER. SHE WAS PRETTY COOL. I STILL THINK ABOUT THAT LITTLE GIRL. THEY COULDN'T FIND HER FATHER, AND HER MOTHER WAS DEAD. YOU EVER WISH YOU'D DONE IT? WHAT? KILLED MY DAD? I LOVED HIM TOO MUCH. THAT'S WEIRD. YEAH, I GUESS IT IS. YOU KNOW WHAT I'VE DECIDED? WE SHOULD TAKE A VACATION... JUST THE TWO OF US. I'D LOVE TO DRIVE THROUGH NEW ENGLAND IN THE FALL. SOONER THAN THE FALL. I'M HELPING GEORGE WITH HIS HOUSE. WHAT? I'VE BEEN HELPING HIM THE LAST FEW DAYS-- WEEKS, ACTUALLY. SAM'S WORKING. WELL, GOOD. THAT'S GREAT. THAT WAS THE PLAN. WE COULDN'T STAND HIM, AND GEORGE NEEDED HELP. I CAN'T GO RIGHT NOW. YOU CAN'T GO BECAUSE OF SAM? WE HAVEN'T BEEN AWAY TOGETHER FOR 3-- 3 YEARS. WHAT DIFFERENCE IS A FEW MONTHS GONNA MAKE? YOU CAN'T GO WITH ME BECAUSE OF SAM. SAM'S WORKING AT SOMETHING FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS ENTIRE LIFE. ONCE IN A WHILE HE EVEN TALKS TO ME. I WANT TO BE AROUND FOR THAT. SO AM I, ROBIN.

THIS IS YOUR FAULT! THESE CLOTHES ARE WORTH A FORTUNE--A FORTUNE! WHAT'S THE POINT OF THIS? DOES EVERYTHING HAVE TO HAVE A POINT? ARE YOU SURE THAT YOU'RE TOTALLY INTO GUYS? I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. JUST--JOSH KINDA SAID-- I'M NOT GAY. I MEAN, HELLO! YEAH, I WAS--I WAS WONDERING. YOU'RE DRIVING ME CRAZY, YOU KNOW THAT? YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TRYING TO JACK OFF IN AN ARMOIRE? NO, NOT REALLY. NO, YOU'RE OFF, YOU KNOW? YOU'RE... YOU'RE WAY OFF. LOOK, I THOUGHT I WAS HELPING YOU. IT WOULD HELP ME IF I COULD KISS YOU. NO. LOOK, I THOUGHT WE WERE JUST FRIENDS. WELL...WHAT YOU THINK YOU KNOW DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE MUCH TO DO WITH REALITY. I MEAN, I HOPE I'M NOT THE FIRST TO SAY THIS ABOUT YOU. ALL RIGHT. BUT THEN WE'RE JUST GONNA BE FRIENDS, OK? YEAH, OK. AHHH! OH, YUCK! OH, YOU'RE SCRUBBING DOWN THE SHOWER. Alyssa: YOU MUST HAVE A REALLY GREAT HUSBAND. Robin: WHY IS THAT? WELL, NO, IT'S JUST-- I MEAN, YOU'RE HERE EVERY SINGLE DAY. HE'S AT WORK WHILE I'M HERE. I GUESS I WOULD JUST BE JEALOUS, IF I WERE HIM. HE HAS NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. HE'S NOT THE TYPE TO WORRY.

[BREATHLESS] [GUSTER BARKS] IT WOULD BE BETTER IF YOU DIDN'T COME EVERY DAY. WHY? I LIKE BEING WITH SAM. BUT THERE'S LESS AND LESS FOR RYAN AND ADAM TO DO AND... I'D HATE FOR THE BOYS TO BE BORED, YOU KNOW. WELL, I KNOW THEY DON'T HELP MUCH ANY MORE, BUT THEY LOVE COMING HERE, GEORGE. BUT, UH... HOW MUCH TIME DO THEY GET TO SPEND WITH THEIR DAD? WHAT IS THIS? YOU KNOW, ALYSSA THINKS SOMETHING'S UP WITH US. SHE KEEPS GIVING ME CRAP ABOUT BEING AWAY FROM PETER, AND NOW YOU'RE DOING IT, TOO. NO ONE REALIZES THAT HE'S NOT THERE. HE'S NEVER THERE. EVEN WHEN HE IS, HE ISN'T... SO IF YOU DON'T WANT ME HERE OR YOU DON'T WANT MY CHILDREN HERE, THEN... SAY IT. I'LL STOP COMING... BUT IT WON'T BE BECAUSE OF PETER. IT'LL BE BECAUSE YOU TOLD ME TO. SO SAY WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY, BECAUSE I'M NOT LEAVING TILL I HEAR IT. I'D RATHER YOU NOT BE HERE. I THOUGHT WE WERE HELPING. [CAR BEEPS] [KNOCKS] HI. HEY. IS ALYSSA HOME? OH, NO. SHE WENT OUT WITH SOME FRIENDS. WHAT FRIENDS DID SHE GO WITH? I DON'T KNOW. YOU CAN COME IN AND WAIT IF YOU LIKE. OK, THANKS, MRS. BECK. Coleen: CAN I GET YOU SOMETHING TO DRINK, JOSH?

IF I WEREN'T MARRIED? SHOULD WE DO THIS? I NEED TO KNOW. WHAT? DO I STILL LOVE YOU? ABSOLUTELY. [SIGHS] THERE'S NOT A DOUBT IN MY MIND. THROUGH ALL MY ANGER, MY EGO, I WAS ALWAYS FAITHFUL IN MY LOVE FOR YOU. THAT I MADE YOU DOUBT IT... THAT IS THE GREAT MISTAKE OF A LIFE FULL OF MISTAKES. THE TRUTH DOESN'T SET US FREE, ROBIN. I CAN TELL YOU I LOVE YOU AS MANY TIMES AS YOU CAN STAND TO HEAR IT, AND ALL THAT DOES, THE ONLY THING IS REMIND US... LOVE IS NOT ENOUGH. NOT EVEN CLOSE. I--I--I'VE GOTTA... OH, GOD. HEY.
