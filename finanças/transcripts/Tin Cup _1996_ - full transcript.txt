WINNER! * A LITTLE BIT IS BETTER THAN NADA * * SOMETIME YOU WANT THE WHOLE ENCHILADA * ANY OF YOU SHITHEELS EVER GET BORED? HUH? YOU EVER GET BORED? [CHUCKLING] I GOT A RIDDLE. YOU GOT A RIDDLE? TAKES ABOUT TWO OUNCES OF BRAINS TO FIGURE IT OUT. ANYBODY THINK THEY GOT A BRAIN WITH TWO OUNCES OF BRAIN IN IT? THERE'S A RUMOR EARL DOES. WELL, FOR CHRIST'S SAKES, BOYS, COME ON, A LITTLE SELF-CONFIDENCE FROM THE PLAYERS' GALLERY, ALL RIGHT? WE AIN'T TALKING LONG DIVISION. Earl: HOW MUCH WE GOT TO LOSE? YOU WANT TO LIVEN THINGS UP, EARL? THAT'S A HELL OF AN IDEA. SO EVERYONE PUTS IN 20 BUCKS. POT GOES TO WHOEVER SOLVES THE RIDDLE. YOU'RE GONNA GET THE RIDDLE, TIN CUP. DEWEY, I'M THE ONE ASKING THE RIDDLE. I ALREADY KNOW THE ANSWER, OK? I DON'T GET A GUESS. ALL RIGHT. ALTHOUGH WE COULD SAY IF I GET TO 500 BOUNCES ON THE OLD WEDGE HERE AND NO ONE GETS THE RIDDLE, I GET THE POT. NOW, I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING. YOU'RE THINKING IT'S AN IMPOSSIBLE RIDDLE. WELL, IT'S NOT. IT'S AN EASY RIDDLE. AND IF SOMEHOW, BY THE GRACE OF FLUKE LUCK, I WIN, AND Y'ALL DON'T AGREE THAT IT WAS AN EASY RIDDLE, WELL, THEN, HELL, UH, I'LL REFUND YOUR MONEY. I'M IN! ALL RIGHT! Earl: MONEY IN THE BANK. I'LL HOLD THE MONEY. COME ON. GIVE IT UP. NOW, A MAN'S DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD WITH HIS SON, AND HE GETS IN A CRASH. TWO AMBULANCES COME AND TAKE THE MAN AND HIS SON TO DIFFERENT HOSPITALS. OK? DIFFERENT HOSPITALS. SON GOES INTO THE OPERATING ROOM, ALL RIGHT? THE DOCTOR LOOKS AT HIM, SAYS, "I CAN'T OPERATE ON THIS BOY." HE'S MY SON. NOW, HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE, HMM? HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE? CLOCK'S TICKING, FELLAS. Earl: THE FATHER'S STILL OVER AT THE OTHER HOSPITAL. I MEAN, HE DIDN'T SNEAK BACK IN, RIGHT? THIS AIN'T STAR TREK, EARL. NOBODY BEAMED HIM ABOARD. ALL RIGHT. WHAT ABOUT IF THE FATHER MARRIED THE SON'S DAUGHTER? THIS IS A FAMILY RIDDLE, EARL. YOU GOTTA THINK CLEAN THOUGHTS. GIVE US A LITTLE HINT. Roy: YOU WANT A HINT, CLINT? Clint: LITTLE HINT. ALL RIGHT. Woman: THE DOCTOR'S A WOMAN. THE DOCTOR'S A WOMAN. SEE, THE DOCTOR'S THE SON'S MOTHER. FEMINISTS POSED THE RIDDLE TO REVEAL HOW DEEPLY OUR SEXUAL STEREOTYPES RUN. I, UH, TAKE IT YOU'RE A FEMINIST. [MEN SNICKER] MA'AM, I'VE BEEN CALLED A LOT OF THINGS BEFORE, NEVER BEEN SADDLED WITH THAT ONE. WELL, YOU MIGHT TRY BEING SADDLED SOMETIME: SMELL OF LEATHER, STING OF A WHIP. MERCY. OOH! WELL, I'M JUST A HUMBLE GOLF PRO. COULD I HELP YOU? YOU'RE ROY McAVOY, THE GOLF PRO? MM-HMM. OH, WELL, I PICTURED SOMETHING, UH, DIFFERENT. I HAVE A 7:00 LESSON. I THOUGHT I HAD A DR. GRISWOLD. UM... THAT'S ME. OK. FIRST THING YOU GOT TO LEARN ABOUT THIS GAME, DOC, IS IT AIN'T ABOUT HITTING SOME LITTLE WHITE BALL IN SOME YONDER HOLE. IT'S ABOUT INNER DEMONS: SELF-DOUBT, HUMAN FRAILTY, AND OVERCOMING ALL THAT CRAP. OH, YEAH. SO WHAT KIND OF DOCTOR DID YOU SAY YOU WERE? I'M A PSYCHOLOGIST. IN LAYMAN'S TERMS CALL ME NEO-JUNGIAN, POSTMODERN, FREUDIAN, HOLISTIC, SECULARIST. OK. I MEAN, INNER DEMONS AND HUMAN FRAILTY, WELL, THAT'S MY LIFE'S WORK. I USED TO PRACTICE IN EL PASO, BUT I MOVED HERE NOW. WHAT IS ALL THIS STUFF? OH, I ORDERED ALL THIS FROM THE GOLF CHANNEL. IT'S A-- IT'S A WASTE OF MONEY. WELL, NO, I'M-- LOOK, I'M SURE THAT THERE ARE SOME EXCESSES AND REPETITIONS HERE, BUT I BELIEVE IN THE GATHERING OF KNOWLEDGE, AND I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, THERE MUST BE SOME TRUTH TO THE GOLF SWING ILLUSTRATED BY SOME OF THESE DEVICES, AND THAT YOU WOULD JUST KIND OF HELP ME, YOU KNOW, SORT THROUGH IT ALL. I HAVE DOZENS OF GOLF VIDEOTAPES, TOO. I'LL BET SHE'S GOT A GOLF WATCH. YOU GOT A GOLF WATCH? YEAH. I THINK I GOT A PRETTY GOOD ONE. RIGHT THERE. WELL, TAKE IT OFF. TAKE IT OFF? ALL OF IT, RIGHT NOW. JUST--ALL OF IT NOW. YOU'RE A SMART WOMAN, FOR CHRIST'S SAKES, RIGHT? JEEZ. DON'T YOU KNOW THE WORK OF HUSTLERS WHEN YOU SEE IT? WELL, NO. I MEAN, I CAN ALWAYS TELL WHEN SOMEONE'S LYING TO HIMSELF, OK? BUT I'M QUITE SUSCEPTIBLE AND FREQUENTLY WRONG WHEN THAT PERSON LIES TO ME. I MEAN, CHRIST, THIS STUFF COST ME OVER $200. WELL, IT'S $200 OF SHIT. WELL, THAT'S JUST GREAT. WHY DON'T WE DO THIS THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY? JUST GO TAKE A SWING. ALL RIGHT. OK. COME ON. EXCUSE ME. OH! FUCK. WELL, YOU TALK LIKE A GOLFER. THAT'S A PRETTY GIRL TO HAVE SUCH AN UGLY SWING. OH! GOD! OH, THAT HURT. SHIT! FUCK. SHIT. THOSE ARE HIGHLY TECHNICAL GOLF TERMS. YOU'RE USING THEM ON YOUR VERY FIRST LESSON. THIS IS PROMISING. OK, WISE-ASS. SHOW ME. JUST GO AHEAD. [SIGHS] SOMETHING LIKE THAT. THAT'S IMPRESSIVE. YOU KNOW, LOOK, I TEND TO PROCESS THINGS VERBALLY, SO DO YOU THINK YOU COULD BREAK DOWN INTO WORDS HOW YOU JUST DID THAT? YOU MEAN, WHAT IS THE GOLF SWING BY ROY McAVOY? WELL, I TEND TO THINK OF THE GOLF SWING AS A POEM. OH, HE'S DOING THAT POETRY THING AGAIN. CRITICAL OPENING PHRASE OF THIS POEM WILL ALWAYS BE THE GRIP, WHICH THE HANDS UNITE TO FORM A SINGLE UNIT BY THE SIMPLE OVERLAP OF THE... LITTLE FINGER. RIGHT. LOWLY AND SLOWLY... THE CLUB HEAD IS LED BACK, PULLED INTO POSITION, NOT BY THE HANDS, BUT BY THE BODY, WHICH TURNS AWAY FROM THE TARGET, SHIFTING WEIGHT TO THE RIGHT SIDE WITHOUT SHIFTING BALANCE. TEMPO IS EVERYTHING, PERFECTION UNATTAINABLE. AS THE BODY COILS NOW TO THE TOP OF THE SWING, THERE'S A SLIGHT HESITATION, A LITTLE NOD TO THE GODS, UH, A NOD TO THE GODS? YEAH. TO THE GODS. THAT HE IS FALLIBLE. PERFECTION IS UNATTAINABLE, AND NOW THE WEIGHT BEGINS SHIFTING BACK TO THE LEFT, PULLED BY THE POWERS INSIDE THE EARTH. IT'S ALIVE, THIS THING, A LIVING SCULPTURE, AND DOWN THROUGH CONTACT, ALWAYS DOWN, STRIKING THE BALL CRISPLY... WITH CHARACTER. A TUNING FORK GOES OFF IN YOUR HEART, YOUR BALLS. SUCH A PURE FEELING IS THE WELL-STRUCK GOLF SHOT. AND THEN THE FOLLOW-THROUGH TO FINISH, ALWAYS ON LINE. THE REVERSE "C" OF THE GOLDEN BEAR. THE STEELWORKER'S POWER AND BRAWN OF CARL SANDBURG'S... ARNOLD PALMER! OH, HE'S DOING THAT ARNOLD PALMER THING. AND THE UNFINISHED SYMPHONY OF ROY McAVOY. UM... WHAT? WHAT'S UNFINISHED? WELL, I HAVE A SHORT FOLLOW-THROUGH, HAS AN UNFINISHED LOOK. WHY? WELL, SOME SAY IT'S BECAUSE THAT'S THE EASIEST WAY TO PLAY THROUGH THE WINDS OF WEST TEXAS. SOME SAY IT'S BECAUSE I'VE NEVER FINISHED ANYTHING IN MY LIFE. YOU CAN DECIDE, BUT THE POINT IS EVERY FINISHING POSITION IS UNIQUE. HUH. THAT'S WHAT THE GOLF SWING'S ALL ABOUT. IT'S ABOUT GAINING CONTROL OF YOUR LIFE AND LETTING GO AT THE SAME TIME. JEEZ, LOUISE. THERE'S ONLY ONE OTHER ACCEPTABLE THEORY ABOUT HOW TO HIT A GOLF BALL. OH, BOY. WELL, I'M AFRAID TO ASK. WELL, WHAT IS IT? WHAT'S THE OTHER THEORY? GRIP IT AND RIP IT. [MOLLY CHUCKLES] WELL, YOU KNOW, UM... WHILE I DO APPRECIATE YOUR POETIC SENSIBILITY, MR. McAVOY. CALL ME ROY, MOLLY. WELL, CALL ME DR. GRISWOLD, ROY, BUT AT THIS POINT, I REALLY THING I'M MORE OF THE GRIP-IT-AND- RIP-IT SCHOOL. WELL, THEN, LET'S TEE IT UP. ALL RIGHT, WAGGLE. WAGGLE. NO, NO, LOOK. HE'S GOT HER WAGGLING NOW. Earl: OH, LORD. WAGGLE THE CLUBHEAD. OK?AH. IT'S A LITTLE RELAXING RITUAL WE DO, OK? OK. JUST WAGGLE IT. [MEN SNICKER] WAGGLE IT AND LET THE BIG DOG EAT. WHAT BIG DOG? THE DRIVER, THE NUMBER 1 WOOD. WELL, THIS IS METAL. YEAH. WELL, WOODS ARE METAL. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. THE DRIVER'S KNOWN AS THE BIG DOG. I'M JUST SAYING, "LET HIM LOOSE. LET 'ER RIP. LET THE BIG DOG EAT." OK. OK. EH-HEH. OH! OH. YOU KNOW, THIS IS WITHOUT A DOUBT THE STUPIDEST, SILLIEST, MOST IDIOTIC GROTESQUERY MASQUERADING AS A GAME THAT HAS EVER BEEN INVENTED-- EVER. YES, MA'AM... AND THAT'S WHY I LOVE IT. NOW, YOU HIT ONE GOOD SHOT, OK? OK? ONE, AND THAT TUNING FORK RINGS IN YOUR LOINS... YOU CAN'T WAIT TO GET BACK. TRY IT AGAIN. MM-HMM. WELL, I THINK THE BIG DOG JUST ATE SOMETHING THERE. MM-HMM. DID THAT TUNING FORK RING IN YOUR LOINS? WELL, I WOULDN'T GO THAT FAR. WELL, I ALWAYS SAY QUIT ON A GOOD SHOT. WE'LL CALL THAT LESSON NUMBER ONE? WELL, OH, OK. AND, UM... IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND PAYING ME IN CASH? THERE'S A LITTLE SITUATION I'M DEALING WITH WITH THE IRS, OK? MM-HMM. WITH THOSE GUYS, I GOTTA BOB AND WEAVE AROUND THE FACTS OF LIFE, IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. YEAH. LOOK, CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION? IF YOU'RE SUCH A LEGENDARY STRIKER OF THE GOLF BALL, AS EVERYONE SAYS, THEN WHY ARE YOU, AT YOUR AGE, OUT HERE IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE OPERATING A BARELY SOLVENT ESTABLISHMENT, DUCKING THE IRS, COLLECTING A FEW PATHETIC DOLLARS TO BUY YOUR NEXT SIX-PACK WHEN YOU'RE CAPABLE OF SO MUCH MORE? PERHAPS I'M CHOCK FULL OF INNER DEMONS. NO. HMM? YOU'RE CHOCK FULL OF BULLSHIT. ANYWAY... SAME TIME NEXT WEEK? WHAT DO YOU MEAN I SHOULD TRY BEING SADDLED SOMETIME? WERE YOU BEING LITERAL, OR WAS THAT SOME FREUDIAN TYPE OF DEAL? MOLLY? DOCTOR? WHAT KIND OF SADDLE? [CAR HONKING] [HONK] DAVID SIMMS. WHAT THE HELL YOU DOING HERE, MAN? HEY THERE, ROMEO. BEEN A WHILE, HASN'T IT? YEAH. TIN CUP AROUND? UH, NO. HE'S IN, UM, HOUSTON ON BUSINESS, YOU KNOW. ANYWAY, I THOUGHT YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE ON THE BIG PRO GOLF TOUR. WELL, YOU TELL TIN CUP THAT I'M IN TOWN FOR MY BIG CHARITY BEST BALL TOURNAMENT. I GOT A SPOT FOR HIM IF HE EVER GETS BACK FROM, UH... UH, UH, HOUSTON. YEAH. WHEREVER. WELL, UH, I THOUGHT YOU HATED HIM, MAN. HELL, I HAVEN'T EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT HIM IN A DOZEN YEARS. HEH HEH HEH. NOT SINCE THE GOOD OLD DAYS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON WHEN WE WON ALL THEM TITLES TOGETHER. GOD ALMIGHTY. WELL, HE SAYS HE CARRIED YOU ON HIS BACK ALL THEM YEARS, MAN. WELL, I DIDN'T HAVE MUCH CRAFT BACK THEN, ROMEO, JUST A LITTLE NATIVE ABILITY. NOW, OLD ROY, HE'S A HELLUVA BALL STRIKER, ISN'T HE? WHAT DO YOU WANT, MAN? I WANT TO WIN MY OWN TOURNAMENT, ROMEO. BET YOU DO. NOW, OLD ROY, HE CAN HELP ME IF WE CAN MANAGE TO BEHAVE LIKE GROWN-UPS TOGETHER. YEP. YOU NEVER KNOW, HUH? YOU TELL HIM THAT. YEAH. I'LL BE SURE TO TELL HIM. SO WHAT'S THE-- WHAT'S THE CATCH, DAVID? HELLO, CUP. THERE IS NO CATCH. I PUT TOGETHER THIS LITTLE TOURNAMENT, AN ELITE FIELD OF PLAYERS, AND A HALF-MILLION DOLLAR PURSE, AND, BY GOD, I'M TIRED OF SEEING THE MONEY HEAD OUT OF TOWN. MAKE MORE BIRDIES. YEAH. WELL... THAT'S WHERE YOU COME IN, PARTNER. I NEED YOU ON MY TEAM. WELL, I REPEAT. WHAT'S THE CATCH? WE'RE PLAYING COTTONWOOD, WHERE YOU ONCE SHOT A 59. WHERE YOU CAN STILL SHOOT 65 IN YOUR SLEEP. BECAUSE YOU KNOW EVERY BUMP ON EVERY FAIRWAY AND EVERY SUBTLE BREAK ON EVERY GREEN. HOT TUB, ROY? IT'S A SPA. HA HA HA! YOU AND ME AT COTTONWOOD. KIND OF LIKE THE OLD DAYS, ISN'T IT? HA HA HA! YEAH, WELL, PUT 'ER THERE, PARTNER! THESE TWO HOMEBOYS ARE GONNA SHOW THE WORLD WHAT GOLF IN WEST TEXAS IS ALL ABOUT. HELL, I'LL BE A GODDAMN BIRDIE-MAKING MACHINE FOR YOU OUT THERE. OH, WHOA. WHOA, WAIT A MINUTE THERE, ROY. HELL, I DIDN'T MEAN I WANTED YOU TO PLAY WITH ME. I WANT YOU TO CADDY FOR ME. YOU KNOW, READ THE GREENS, CLUB ME, THAT KIND OF STUFF. QUE TE LLEVE LA CHINGADA, CABRóN, QUÉ CADDY NI QUÉ NADA. CADDY? COME ON, ROY. HELL, I CAN'T BRING A GUY IN OFF THE STREET TO PLAY IN MY TOURNAMENT. I MEAN, FOR CHRIST'S SAKES, GUYS, THIS HAS BECOME A BIG-TIME EVENT. HELL, I GOT CORPORATE SPONSORS, 30 BUCKS A TICKET. THIS GUY OFF THE STREET COULD KICK YOUR ASS ON THE GOLF COURSE ANYTIME, MAN. HE KICKED YOUR ASS IN JUNIOR GOLF, JUST LIKE HE KICKED YOUR ASS IN UNIVERSITY-- NO. FUCK IT, MAN. I'LL GIVE YOU 100 BUCKS FOR THE LOOP. AND 5% OF ANY EARNINGS, ROY. GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE, MAN, AND TAKE YOUR PINCHE COLOR-COORDINATED, CORPORATE-SPONSORED CHINGADA AND TAKE A FLYING FUCK ON THE ROLLING-- ROMEO. I GOT IT, MAN. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. [CLEARING THROAT] WELL, I WAS JUST TRYING TO OFFER YOU SOME WORK. Romeo: YEAH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. DAVID? YEAH? I'LL TAKE THE JOB. YEAH. WE'LL TAKE THE JOB. * FLAT BROKE * * AND BUSTED * * JUST DON'T SEEM FAIR * * THE MAN IN HEAVEN * * DON'T HEAR MY PRAYER * * AND THESE DICE ARE LOADED * * BUT I STILL CAN'T WIN * * FLAT BROKE AND BUSTED * THIS LOOKS LIKE IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE MORE THAN YOU GOT IN THE BAG, PARTNER. Roy: I COULD MAKE THAT. * ALL CRAPPED OUT A-- * SHIT. * GAIN * IS HE ON? HE'S ON. PRETTY GOOD SHAPE, TOO. Romeo: MY GUY COULD DO IT. I'VE SEEN HIM DO IT LOTS OF TIMES, AND YOU HAVE EXTRA-LARGE HUEVOS. Man: HIT IT! WOMAN: OH! OH! OH! SHIT! FUCK THAT! I TOLD YOU THAT WAS MORE THAN YOU HAD IN YOUR BAG. SHIT, I HAD TO, PARTNER. I MEAN, YOUR DAMN CADDY CAME BY AND TOLD ME THAT HE'D GET ON THE GREEN FROM HERE. I COULD. HEH HEH HEH! I GOT TO HAND IT TO YOU, ROY. FOR 15 HOLES, YOU SEEMED TO GRASP THE CONCEPT HERE. SEE, I'M TRYING TO WIN THIS TOURNAMENT, AND YOUR JOB IS TO HELP ME. GIVE ME THE 7-IRON. I'M GONNA LAY UP. DAVID, YOU CAN MAKE THAT SHOT. HELL, I CAN MAKE THAT SHOT, EASY. I KNOW I CAN MAKE THIS GODDAMN SHOT, BUT THE SMART PLAY IS TO LAY UP. THESE PEOPLE DIDN'T PAY 30 BUCKS TO SEE A TOUR STAR LAY UP ON A SHORT PAR 5. I'M SITTING ON A 2-SHOT LEAD WITH 3 TO GO. THANKS TO YOU, MY PARTNER'S IN HIS POCKET. SUDDENLY, PAR'S A HELLUVA NUMBER TO ME. 13 YEARS ON THE TOUR, YOU'RE STILL A PUSSY. GOD DAMN IT, DAVID. JUST HIT THE FUCKING 3. HIT IT. 13 YEARS ON THE DRIVING RANGE, YOU STILL THINK THIS GAME IS ABOUT YOUR TESTOSTERONE COUNT. NOW, BACK UP. 230 TO CARRY AND THE TOUR STARS LAY IT UP. HA HA HA! HA HA HA! SO SIMMS, FROM THE ROUGH, THAT'S A SMART PLAY. [CROWD APPLAUDS] HEY, DAVID, YOU IN A HURRY OR WHAT? WHY? I GOT A PILE OF NICKELS IN THE CAR THAT YOUR CADDY CAN KNOCK IT ON FROM HERE. COME ON, GUYS. WE'RE TRYING TO WIN A TOURNAMENT HERE. YEAH. WE ARE. THAT'S GREAT, BUT I GOT 5 TO 1. THOSE ARE PRETTY GOOD ODDS. I THINK HE CAN DO IT. Man: LET HIM HIT IT. IT'S ONLY AN EXHIBITION. COME ON, ROY. YOU CAN HANDLE IT. I GOT A BALL. RIGHT HERE. BALLS VERSUS BRAINS, ROY. YOU HIT THAT SHOT, JUST KEEP WALKING 'CAUSE YOUR ASS IS FIRED. HOW ARE YOU GONNA FIRE ME IN FRONT OF ALL THESE PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY WHEN I KNOCK IT ON THE GREEN? Announcer: IT LOOKS LIKE THE CADDY WANTS TO HIT THE SHOT. PETER KOSTIS, WHAT'S GOING ON DOWN THERE? BOYS, I THINK THINGS HAVE OFFICIALLY CHANGED HERE NOW. FORGET THE 2-SHOT LEAD. FORGET 3 HOLES TO GO. HEY, ROY, YOU NEED A GLOVE. IT'LL HELP. THERE'S A LITTLE SIDE ACTION GOING ON DOWN THERE. AND THE $250,000 PURSE HAS JUST GOTTEN A LITTLE BIT BIGGER. GARY, YOU OBVIOUSLY DON'T THINK THIS GUY CAN PULL THIS SHOT OFF? I'LL TELL YOU WHAT. I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY CHANCE. LET ME GIVE YOU A LITTLE BACKGROUND HERE. THIS IMPENDING DISASTER'S A DRIVING RANGE PRO. HIS NAME IS ROY McAVOY. EVERYBODY CALLS HIM TIN CUP. THE LOCALS AROUND HERE TELL ME HE WAS A PRETTY GOOD COLLEGE PLAYER. HE HUNG AROUND THE MINI-TOURS FOR A WHILE. HE'S GONNA HAVE TO HAVE BEEN A HELLUVA COLLEGE PLAYER TO PULL THIS SHOT OFF. HE'S GOT 240 YARDS. HE'S GOT A NATIONAL TELEVISION AUDIENCE. HE'S GOT A BIG GALLERY HERE, AND HE HASN'T HIT A GOLF BALL YET. WELL, THIS IS SOMETHING WE DON'T SEE EVERY DAY: NATIONAL TELEVISION WITH NO WARMUP. HOW DO YOU LIKE THOSE ODDS, BOB? I DON'T KNOW WHO THIS GUY IS, BUT IF THIS GUY EVEN GETS IT OUT OF THERE, I'D BE SURPRISED. A TOUR PRO I'D GIVE 10 TO 1. Roy: DOLLAR BILLS. OH, HE'S GOT THAT GOOD. Announcer: DO YOU BELIEVE THIS? UNBELIEVABLE. Stadler: WHAT A CADDY. GOOD SHOT. THANKS FOR THE GLOVE. YOU. YEAH. YOU. COME HERE. COME HERE. CAN YOU CARRY THAT BAG? YEAH. PICK IT UP. YES, SIR. NICE SHOT, ROY. HEY. COME HERE. COME HERE A SECOND. TAKE A HIKE. THE LOOP'S OVER. YOU CAN'T FIRE ME. HEY, DAVID, COME ON, MAN. HOW CAN YOU FIRE ME? I--HEY, I JUST KNOCKED IT STIFF FROM 250. HE'S ALWAYS BEEN A JERK. COME ON, DAVID. WHAT ABOUT MY MONEY? YOU JUST HIT THE SHOT THAT TOOK YOU OUT OF THE MONEY, BUD. WELCOME TO LIFE ON THE TOUR. TONIGHT, THE SPORTS MACHINE BRINGS YOU A BIZARRE INCIDENT AT THE CHARITY GOLF EVENT OF TOUR STAR DAVID SIMMS. LET'S GO TO WEST TEXAS, WHERE DRIVING-RANGE PRO TIN CUP McAVOY, SERVING AS A CADDY TO DAVID SIMMS AT THE CELEBRITY EVENT-- HE GRABBED A 3-WOOD OUT OF HIS OWN BAG AND DRILLED A 240-YARD SHOT OVER WATER TO THE 16th GREEN... IF I HAD IT ALL TO DO OVER, I'D STILL HIT THAT SHOT. YEAH. I KNOW. MAN, YOU'D BURY YOURSELF ALIVE JUST TO PROVE YOU COULD HANDLE THE SHOVEL. YOU KNOW WHY I'D STILL HIT THAT SHOT? YEAH. 'CAUSE IT'S THE ONLY WAY YOU COULD BEAT DAVE SIMMS. NO. 'CAUSE YOU GET THAT LOOK IN YOUR FACE. I HIT IT AGAIN BECAUSE THAT SHOT WAS A DEFINING MOMENT, AND WHEN A DEFINING MOMENT COMES ALONG, YOU DEFINE THE MOMENT, OR THE MOMENT DEFINES YOU. I DID NOT SHRINK FROM THE CHALLENGE. I ROSE TO IT. 1981, FORT WASHINGTON GOLF CLUB, FRESNO, CALIFORNIA. RING A BELL? THE FINAL ROUND OF THE TOUR QUALIFYING SCHOOL? I WAS PLAYING TO WIN. TRIED TO HIT THAT SAME IMPOSSIBLE CUT 3-WOOD INTO THE WIND FROM A HILLY LIE. I WAS PLAYING TO WIN. 5 IN A ROW OUT OF BOUNDS TILL YOU FINALLY PULLED IT OFF AND TAPPED IT IN FOR A CROWD-PLEASING 13 WHEN A 12 WOULD HAVE GOT YOU ON THE TOUR. NOW THAT WAS A DEFINING MOMENT, AND THE DEFINITION WAS "SHIT." GREATNESS COURTS FAILURE, ROMEO. YOU MAY BE RIGHT, BOSS, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? SOMETIMES PAR IS GOOD ENOUGH TO WIN. WE OWE HER $12,000. NO. I OWE HER $12,000, ALL RIGHT? I OWE HER. OK, FINE. YOU OWE HER $12,000. LIKE IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE. IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE. LOOK, BOSS, I ONLY GOT ONE RULE, AND THAT'S DON'T BET MONEY YOU DON'T HAVE ON A DOG RACE WITH AN EX-GIRLFRIEND WHO HAPPENS TO BE A STRIPPER. NOW YOU BROKE THAT RULE, AND YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO BE SWEET TO HER, HOMES. LOOK, YOU GOT TO TELL HER SOMETHING NICE TO START OFF WITH. YOU KNOW, KIND OF LIKE AN ICE BREAKER. HOW HARD CAN IT BE? LOOK, I'LL SAY ONE THING NICE. IF IT DON'T COME OUT RIGHT, THEN YOU SAY IT BETTER. HEY, TIN CUP. DOREEN'S LOOKING FOR YOU. YEAH, I'LL BET SHE IS. * OH, BABY, YOU LOOK SO GOOD TO ME * HEY, TIN CUP. HAVEN'T SEEN YOU FOR THREE DAYS. I'M A BUSY MAN. HEY, TIN CUP. HI, SWEETIE. HI, HONEY. THAT BETTER BE YOU, ROY. JUST BE NICE, OK? DOREEN. YOU'RE LOOKING PARTICULARLY LOVELY THIS EVENING. YEAH, THAT'S EVEN NICER THAN THE LEOPARD SUIT-- CUT THE HORSESHIT, GUYS. YOU OWE ME $12,000. AND WE'RE GONNA PAY IT. DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT. OH, I KNOW YOU'RE GONNA PAY ME. 12 SMACKEROOS. WHERE IS IT? THERE. WHAT IS THIS? WITH EQUITY AND INVENTORY, IT'S WORTH 12 GRAND, MORE OR LESS. THIS IS HOW YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA SETTLE UP? BY GIVING ME THE DEED TO YOUR DRIVING RANGE. ONLY ON THE CONDITION THAT YOU DON'T SELL RIGHT AWAY, AND ME AND ROMEO KEEP OUR JOBS. WHAT IN THE WORLD WOULD I WANT WITH YOUR STUPID DRIVING RANGE? EQUITY, INVENTORY, CASH FLOW, NOT TO MENTION AN ENHANCED STATURE IN THE COMMUNITY, PLUS A PREPAID MEMBERSHIP IN SALOME CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. WHAT ARE YOUR LABOR COSTS? EVERYBODY GETS WHAT THEY'RE GETTING. AHEM. BUT THE TRACTOR KID GETS 5 BUCKS AN HOUR. AND ROMEO GETS 10, CASH. WHAT DO YOU PAY YOURSELF? MYSELF? YOU KNOW, TO STAND AROUND ALL DAY AND HIT THOSE LITTLE GOLF BALLS, WHEN YOU'RE NOT BREAKING FOR BEERS OR CORN DOGS OR TO GATHER THE GUYS UP AND LAY BETS ON WHICH CROW'S GONNA FLY OFF THE FENCE NEXT. ARE YOU REFERRING TO MY MANAGERIAL SALARY? I AM REFERRING TO EVERY RED NICKEL THAT YOU TAKE FROM THE TILL AND EVERY BAG OF BEER NUTS THAT YOU LIFT FROM THE RACK. THAT IS WHAT I'M REFERRING TO. HE'LL TAKE THE DEAL. HE'LL TAKE THE DEAL. WHAT IS THE DEAL? OK, LET'S JUST SAY THE DRIVING RANGE IS WORTH 10,000. YOU STILL OWE ME 2. * MAYBE TOMORROW * * I'LL SEE SOME LIGHT * * AND I'LL KNOW THE DIFFERENCE * * BETWEEN WRONG AND RIGHT * * MY SHIP IS OUT THERE * * NO, BUT IT CAN'T COME IN * * FLAT BROKE AND BUSTED * * CRAPPED OUT AGAIN * SHE'S BEEN HERE A WHILE. AM I EARLY? MR. McAVOY, I CAN APPRECIATE THAT YOU HAVE A FAIRLY LAID-BACK, RELAXED LIFESTYLE, BUT I HAVE HOURS TO KEEP. ALL RIGHT. A FORMER PARAMOUR ONCE ASCRIBED MY FLUID SENSE OF TIME TO BEING BORN UNDER THE SIGN OF PISCES. SOMETHING ABOUT FLOATING THROUGH THE UNIVERSE. OH. YOU AMUSE ME, ROY, BUT I'M THE ONLY WOMAN IN AMERICA BORN AFTER WORLD WAR II WHO THINKS ASTROLOGY'S A CROCK OF SHIT. NOW LET'S SEE IF THE BIG DOG'LL EAT. WAGGLE. I'M WAGGLING. SET UP TO THE BALL LIKE I SHOWED YOU LAST TIME. I AM SETTING UP TO THE BALL. WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. HOLD ON, HOLD ON. YEAH. QUIT TRYING TO WRING THE CLUB'S NECK, MOLLY. SHOW A LITTLE WARMTH, A LITTLE COMPASSION. REMEMBER, THIS GAME'S ABOUT TRUST AND TOUCH... AND LETTING GO, SO WHILE I SUBTLY ENHANCE YOUR TECHNICAL PROSPECTS, WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME ALL ABOUT YOUR PERSONAL LIFE? THAT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS, ROY. YOUR BOYFRIEND'S A GOLFER. THAT'S MY BET. HE'S THE REASON YOU'RE TAKING THIS GAME UP. HELL, I PROBABLY EVEN KNOW HIM. GET YOUR HANDS OFF HER ASS, ROY. HI, HONEY. HI, DARLIN'. HE'S TAKING HER TO MIAMI FOR THE FUCKING DORAL. HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO COMPETE WITH THAT? MAN, YOU ARE HAVING A BAD WEEK, AREN'T YOU? MAN, SHE MUST THINK I'M SUCH A NOTHING, SUCH A LOSER. A LOUSY DRIVING-RANGE PRO LIVING IN A WINNEBAGO. SHE DON'T KNOW YOU LIVE IN A WINNEBAGO. WELL, SHE SURE AS HELL KNOWS I AIN'T TAKING HER TO NO DORAL FOR MASSAGES AND MIMOSAS ALL WEEKEND. OH, GOD. I DIDN'T LEAVE IT OUT. WELL, I DIDN'T. GOTTA DO SOMETHING WITH MY LIFE. YOU JUST THREW THAT IN THE SPA. GOTTA RISE TO A LEVEL WORTHY OF THE WOMEN WHO THINK I'M A JOKE. WELL, YOU COULD GO OUT AND WIN THE U.S. OPEN. THAT WOULD IMPRESS HER. WHAT? WIN THE OPEN, MAN. SHE'LL THINK, "OH, YOU'RE WONDERFUL, ROY." ROMEO, THAT IDEA HAS PROMISE. ARE WE TALKING ABOUT THE SAME GOLF TOURNAMENT, HUH? THE U.S. OPEN, THE BIGGEST GOLF TOURNAMENT IN THE WORLD. NOT JUST THE BIGGEST GOLF TOURNAMENT IN THE WORLD, THE MOST DEMOCRATIC GOLF TOURNAMENT IN THE WORLD. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? SO? WELL, I MEAN IT'S OPEN. IT'S OPEN. ANYBODY WITH A 2 HANDICAP OR BETTER HAS GOT A SHOT AT IT. YOU JUST GOTTA GET THROUGH A LOCAL AND SECTIONAL QUALIFIER, AND UNLIKE DORAL OR COLONIAL OR AT&T, THEY CAN'T KEEP YOU OUT. THEY CAN'T ASK YOU IF YOU'RE A GARBAGE MAN OR A BEAN PICKER OR A DRIVING RANGE PRO WHOSE CHECK'S SIGNED BY A STRIPPER. YOU QUALIFY, YOU'RE IN. YOU DON'T GOT THE GAME, MAN. I GOT EVERY SHOT IN THE BOOK. I'M TALKING ABOUT THE GAME. THE MENTAL GAME, YOU KNOW, LA CABEZA. YOU DON'T GOT IT. WELL, SINCE YOU'RE THE AUTHORITY, HOW'D YOU LIKE TO TEACH ME WHAT I AIN'T AND NEVER WILL BE? WHAT FOR, MAN? YOU'VE NEVER LISTENED TO ME. NEVER. WELL, THIS TIME WILL BE DIFFERENT, I PROMISE. YEAH, RIGHT. YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE THE MONEY TO GET YOUR GOLF CLUBS OUT OF HOCK, AND YOU'RE GONNA WIN THE U.S. OPEN. THAT DON'T FIT, MAN. DON'T FORCE IT IF IT DON'T F-- AHH, IS THAT WHAT THOSE THINGS WERE? FLOWERS? FLOWERS. Man: LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT. YOU'RE GONNA PLAY ME FOR $400 WITH THOSE? YEAH, AND I'LL GIVE YOU 2 STROKES A SIDE. YOU AIN'T GOT NO 400 BUCKS. I GOT THE TITLE OF MY CAR FOR COLLATERAL. I AIN'T INTERESTED IN THAT PIECE OF SHIT. THAT'S 'CAUSE YOU THINK OF IT AS TRANSPORTATION, BOONE. THINK OF IT AS BRAGGING RIGHTS. THINK OF YOURSELF SITTING AROUND THE BAR CROWING TO YOUR CRONIES ABOUT THE CADILLAC YOU WON FROM ME. THEY'LL FORGET ALL ABOUT THE WINNEBAGO YOU LOST TO ME. I'LL CALL THE I.N.S. ON YOU, YOU LITTLE MIDGET. I'LL BE PLAYING A PINK LADY TODAY. IS THAT LITTLE PINK FAG BALL SUPPOSED TO INTIMIDATE ME? WELL, NOT UNLESS I KNOCK IT BY YOU. LOUISVILLE SLUGGER, PLEASE. * I'M DRIVIN' DOWN THE HIGHWAY, HEADED TO THE RANGE * * GONNA KNOCK 'EM OUT STRONG * OH! * GOT AN OLD BROWN BAG * I BELIEVE YOU'RE AWAY. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, JULIO. I THOUGHT I CAUGHT THAT THING WAY THE HELL ON THE TOE. * THERE'S A PLACE FOR YOU IF YOU'RE JUST LIKE ME * YOU DRIVE FOR SHOW, AND YOU PUTT FOR DOUGH, BIG MOUTH. YOU HEAR THAT, ROMEO? BOONE WAS BEING PROFOUND. LET'S SEE, LITTLE WIND LEFT TO RIGHT. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE SHOVEL. YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I WAS THINKING. * WELL, THERE'S A PLACE FOR YOU IF YOU'RE JUST LIKE ME * Boone: ALL RIGHT, I WANT TO SEE A LEGITIMATE SWING. NO SCOOPING. * I'M NOT RICH, AND I'M NOT ON TV * * HAVE ANOTHER COOL ONE, BUT IT WON'T HURT * * GOT MYSELF A BIG STICK SWINGIN' IN THE DIRT * I'LL FINISH. * GOT MYSELF A BIG STICK SWINGIN' IN THE DIRT * GET THE HELL OFF MY GOLF COURSE. UH, NEED A RECEIPT? YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK, GRASSHOPPER? SHE'S GOT YOU BY THE HUEVOS. LISTEN, SWAMI, YOUR JOB'S TO TEACH ME PATIENCE AND HUMILITY, ALL RIGHT, NOT ADVISE ME ON MY LOVE LIFE. NOT ALL MY THINKING OCCURS BELOW THE BELT. I MEAN, I ACTUALLY STAND FOR A FEW THINGS BESIDES WHERE MY NEXT ROMANTIC INTERLUDE'S COMING FROM. WELL, THEN GREAT. YOU WON'T HAVE ANY TROUBLE TELLING THE DOCTOR LADY YOU CAN'T TEACH HER NO MORE UNTIL AFTER THE OPEN. WELL, NOW THAT WOULD MAKE AN ISSUE OF SOMETHING THAT'S NOT AN ISSUE, NOW WOULDN'T IT? YEAH, RIGHT. BESIDES, I'M FOCUSED. I AM! THIS IS MY QUEST! THIS IS WHERE I STAND UP FOR ALL THE LITTLE GUYS EVERYWHERE WHO'VE HAD THEIR FILL OF SOULLESS ROBOTS LIKE DAVID SIMMS. WELL, DAVID SIMMS MAY BE A SOULLESS ROBOT, BUT HE'S A RICH, HAPPY SOULLESS ROBOT WITH A BEAUTIFUL DOCTOR LADY GIRLFRIEND. BESIDES, HOW'S GETTING IN THE OPEN GONNA CHANGE WHAT SHE THINKS ABOUT YOU? WELL, IT'LL SHOW HER I'M NOT WHO SHE THINKS I AM. BUT YOU ARE WHO SHE THINKS YOU ARE, MAN. NO, ROY, I WILL NOT GIVE YOU TIME OFF TO GO WIN THE OPEN. I DON'T CARE IF IT IS YOUR QUEST. HOW ABOUT MY DESTINY? OR YOUR DESTINY. OR ANY OTHER TERM YOU VAGUELY REMEMBER FROM YOUR CLIFF NOTES. THAT'S THE MOST STUPID THING I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE. DON'T GET MEAN, ALL RIGHT? FIRST YOU GET MEAN, THEN YOU GET PETTY. YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN A LITTLE NICER TO ME WHEN WE WERE AN ITEM, AND MAYBE I WOULDN'T BE SUCH A NASTY BOSS. YEAH. ROY, I'VE GOT A BUSINESS TO RUN. BYE-BYE, BON VOYAGE. YOU KNOW WHAT, BECKY, BECKY, BECKY, COME HERE, SWEETHEART. RIGHT NOW, HURRY UP. WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME. NOW, YOU'RE DOING A NATURAL THING, AND IT'S REALLY SWEET, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? WE DON'T DO NATURAL HERE. WE DO BIG AND BOLD. COLORFUL. HAIR, LOTS OF IT, MANY COLORS. LOOK AT ME. THAT'S WHAT WE DO, OK? [DIAL TONE] WELL, IF YOU'RE GONNA TAKE THAT TONE, THEN WE'LL JUST HAVE TO TALK ANOTHER DAY. I'M SORRY, UH, I HAVE THINGS TO DO, AND I DON'T REALLY NEED TO BE TREATED LIKE THAT, SO GOOD-BYE. YOU KNOW, IT WOULDN'T KILL YOU JUST ONCE TO TELL HER SOMETHING LIKE THAT SHE'S BEAUTIFUL OR THAT SHE CAN DANCE OR THAT SHE'S SEXY AS HELL. HERE I AM, READY TO CHARGE FORTH IN PURSUIT OF MY MYTHIC DESTINY, I CAN'T EVEN GET TIME OFF WORK TO DO IT. WELL, I'M NO EXPERT HERE, BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE PURSUIT OF A MYTHIC DESTINY ISN'T SOMETHING YOU NEED TO GET OFF A $7-AN-HOUR JOB IN ORDER TO DO. I'M STUCK, MAN. I'M BURIED. I NEED HELP. I NEED ADVICE, I NEED COUNSELING. I NEED A-- I NEED A SHRINK. YOU DON'T KNOW NO SHRINKS. I KNOW ONE. NO, NO, NO, NO. NOT THE DOCTOR LADY. WHY NOT? YOU CAN'T ASK ADVICE ABOUT THE WOMAN YOU'RE TRYING TO HOSE FROM THE WOMAN YOU'RE TRYING TO HOSE. WHY NOT? [DOOR OPENS] [SOBBING] [SOBBING LOUDLY] SUE ANN. SUE ANN, HONEY. I DIDN'T--I DIDN'T SAY SHIT TO HER. ROY, OH! OK, ROY, GET IN THE OTHER ROOM, PLEASE. SUE ANN, HONEY, IT'S OK. [DOOR OPENS] HEY, LOOK, SHE WAS CRYING WHEN SHE CAME OUT THERE, ALL RIGHT? OK, OK, ROY. THAT IS A PATIENT EXIT ROOM. WELL, I KNEW IT WAS SOME KIND OF ROOM. IT WASN'T PAINTED. THERE WAS NO MAGAZINES OUT THERE. ROY, WHY ARE YOU HERE? THERAPY. YOU'VE COME FOR THERAPY? OK, LOOK, ROY, YOU KNOW, YOU REALLY NEED TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT, BECAUSE I HAVE A CLIENT IN A HALF AN HOUR. THAT'S ENOUGH TIME, 30 MINUTES. HELL, I'M NOT THAT FUCKED UP. OK, ROY, YOU KNOW WHAT? WHY DON'T YOU JUST HAVE A SEAT RIGHT THERE? RIGHT OVER THERE. OK. OK, SO HOW DO I DO IT? THERAPY, I MEAN. I MEAN, HOW DO I START DOING IT? OK, ROY, WELL, IN PARLANCE YOU MIGHT UNDERSTAND, JUST KICK BACK AND LET THE BIG DOG EAT. SUPPOSE THERE'S THIS GUY, AND HE'S STANDING ON THE SHORE OF A BIG, WIDE RIVER, AND THE RIVER'S FULL OF ALL MANNER OF DISASTER, YOU KNOW? PIRANHAS, ALLIGATORS, EDDIES, CURRENTS, SHIT LIKE THAT. NOBODY'LL EVEN GO DOWN THERE TO DIP A TOE, AND ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE RIVER IS A MILLION BUCKS, AND ON THIS SIDE OF THE RIVER IS A ROWBOAT. MM-HMM. I GUESS MY QUESTION IS THIS. WHAT WOULD POSSESS A GUY STANDING ON SHORE TO SWIM FOR IT? HE'S AN IDIOT. NO, SEE, HE'S A HELLUVA SWIMMER. HIS PROBLEM IS MORE LIKE WHY DOES HE ALWAYS HAVE TO RISE TO THE CHALLENGE? HE'S A JUVENILE IDIOT. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT I MEAN BY THE RIVER. ROY. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YOU AND WHAT YOU LIKE TO CALL YOUR INNER DEMONS, THAT HUMAN FRAILTY YOU LIKE TO BLATHER ABOUT. NOT SOME MYTHOPOETIC METAPHOR YOU COME UP WITH IN A FEEBLE AND TRANSPARENT EFFORT TO DO YOURSELF CREDIT. YOU MEAN YOU'RE GONNA MAKE ME FEEL LOUSY? NO. I CAME HERE TO FEEL BETTER. I MEAN, WHAT KIND OF THERAPY IS THIS? YOU DON'T HAVE ANY INNER DEMONS. WHAT YOU HAVE IS INNER CRAP-OLA, INNER DEBRIS, GARBAGE, LOOSE WIRES, A FEW. HORSESHIT IN STAGGERING AMOUNTS. LOOK, I'M NOT SOME JUST JERK DRIVING-RANGE PRO WHO DRINKS TOO MUCH BOOZE, EATS TOO FEW VEGETABLES, OK? ROY, COULD YOU PLEASE SIT DOWN, OK? 'CAUSE YOU'RE GETTING DEFENSIVE, AND I WANT YOU TO JUST CUT TO THE CHASE AND TELL ME WHY YOU'RE HERE. WOMAN. OH, A WOMAN. HAVE YOU ASKED HER OUT? NO. SHE'S SEEING A GUY. I DON'T KNOW HOW SERIOUS IT IS. BUT THE GUY'S A REAL HORSE'S ASS IF YOU ASK ME. MAYBE IF YOU SHARED YOUR HEART WITH THIS WOMAN, YOU KNOW, TOOK HER OUT TO DINNER, THEN IT WOULD FORCE THESE ISSUES OUT TO THE OPEN. WELL, I'M AFRAID SHE'LL SAY NO. SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT ALL YOUR SPEECHES ABOUT SWIMMING ACROSS SHARK-INFESTED WATERS ARE REALLY ABOUT YOUR GOLF GAME, NOT ABOUT YOUR PERSONAL LIFE. OH, JEEZ. SO LOOK, WE'RE GETTING A LITTLE CLOSE TO THE TRUTH. WELL, CHRIST, I DIDN'T KNOW WE WERE GONNA GET INTO MY PERSONAL LIFE. WELL, THIS IS THERAPY, ROY. WELL, I KNOW, BUT I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS THAT KIND OF THERAPY. WELL, OK, LET'S MAKE THIS SIMPLE. ROY, PLEASE, HERE, SIT DOWN RIGHT HERE. YOU KNOW THOSE RISKS THAT YOU LOVE TO TAKE ON THE GOLF COURSE? THE ONES THAT YOU TALK SO PASSIONATELY AND POETICALLY ABOUT. WELL, YOU NEED TO APPLY THOSE SAME RISKS TO YOUR PERSONAL LIFE WITH THE SAME PASSION. YOU MEAN I SHOULD JUST ASK HER OUT? YES. AND RISK COMING RIGHT OVER THE TOP, SNAP, HOOKING IT OUT OF BOUNDS LEFT. ABSOLUTELY, ROY. HITTING IT A LITTLE THIN. OK, ROY. THAT'S GOOD. I'M SORRY. NOW LOOK, ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS WALK UP TO THIS WOMAN, WHEREVER SHE IS, LOOK HER IN THE EYE-- LOOK AT ME, ROY. JUST LOOK HER IN THE EYES. THAT'S RIGHT, LET DOWN YOUR GUARD. DON'T TRY TO BE COOL OR SMOOTH OR WHATEVER. JUST BE HONEST AND TAKE A RISK. AND THEN YOU KNOW WHAT? WHATEVER HAPPENS, IF YOU ACT FROM THE HEART, YOU CAN'T MAKE A MISTAKE. DR. GRISWOLD. YES? I THINK I'M IN LOVE WITH YOU. WHAT? FROM THE MOMENT I FIRST SAW YOU, I KNEW I WAS THROUGH WITH BAR GIRLS AND STRIPPERS AND MOTORCYCLE CHICKS, AND WHEN YOU FIRST STARTED TALKING, I WAS SMITTEN WITH YOU, AND I'M SMITTEN WITH YOU MORE EVERY DAY I THINK ABOUT YOU, AND THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW I'M FULL OF CRAP-OLA ONLY MAKES YOU EVEN MORE ATTRACTIVE TO ME. USUALLY I CAN BULLSHIT PEOPLE, BUT I CAN'T BULLSHIT YOU, AND IN ADDITION, YOU GOT GREAT LEGS, AND MOST WOMEN, I'M THINKING ABOUT HOW TO GET IN THEIR PANTS FROM DAY ONE, BUT WITH YOU I'M JUST-- I'M JUST THINKING ABOUT HOW TO GET IN YOUR HEART. ROY, UH-- STUNNED, HUH? SO, UH, SO WHAT ABOUT DINNER? AND WE CAN TALK ABOUT US AND IF WE HAVE A FUTURE AND HOW TO DROP THAT HORSE'S-ASS BOYFRIEND OF YOURS. ROY, JUST SLOW DOWN, OK? WHAT? I JUST HIT A 8-DEGREE DRIVER OFF THE CARPET. I MEAN, I'M STARING EAGLE IN THE FACE. OK, WILL YOU JUST CUT THE GOLF TALK, PLEASE? BECAUSE THIS IS A MISTAKE. WELL, I'M ACTING FROM THE HEART. HOW CAN THAT BE A MISTAKE? RIGHT? WRONG, ROY, I MEAN-- SHIT. I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT ME, ROY. WELL, WOULD YOUR ADVICE HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT? UH, HA. ROY... YOU KNOW, THIS SESSION IS OVER. I HAVE SOMEONE COMING SOON. I THINK YOU BETTER LEAVE. I TAKE IT YOUR ANSWER IS NO. WELL, OUR RELATIONSHIP IS, AND WILL REMAIN, STRICTLY PROFESSIONAL. THAT'S IT? YEAH. WELL, I'M GONNA QUALIFY FOR THE U.S. OPEN AND KICK YOUR BOYFRIEND'S ASS. AND WHATEVER YOU THINK OF ME, YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT YOUR BOYFRIEND, HE HATES OLD PEOPLE, HE HATES CHILDREN, AND HE HATES DOGS, AND THAT BROAD'S OUT THERE CRYING STILL IN THE EXIT ROOM. YOU'RE STILL IN THE EXIT ROOM. [PATIENT SOBBING] HELLO. UM, DR. KASSELDORF, YOU'RE THERE. WELL, YOU ALWAYS SAID TO CALL IF SOMETHING CAME UP THAT CONFUSED ME, AND YOU KNOW, SHRINKS NEED SHRINKS, BUT IT HAPPENED. I MEAN, YOU SAID IT WOULD. A PATIENT CAME IN AND THINKS THAT HE'S FALLING IN LOVE WITH ME. I MEAN, HE'S NOT REALLY A PATIENT, HE'S MY GOLF PRO, BUT-- NO. I KNOW THAT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCE, THAT I'M SUPPOSED TO RECOMMEND ANOTHER THERAPIST, BUT THERE ARE NO OTHER THERAPISTS IN SALOME. I MEAN, HE'D HAVE TO DRIVE 100 MILES TO MIDLAND OR ODESSA, AND I'M NOT SURE YOU COULD COUNT ON ANY HELP THERE. ME? NO, MY SELF-ESTEEM IS FINE. MY SELF-ESTEEM IS FINE. WELL, HE'S A GOOD-LOOKING MAN. GREEN EYES, I DON'T KNOW-- THAT'S NOT THE POINT, IS IT? WELL, HE'S, YOU KNOW, HE'S KIND OF CUTE. HE'S CUTE. B-BUT I MEAN-- OK. OK. OK. UH-HUH. * OH, I WISH I COULD LAUGH * * WHEN I LOOK WAY BACK * * FIND OUT WHO STOLE ALL MY DREAMS * * OH, I WISH IT WAS EASY * * TO FACE THE FACT * * THERE WAS NOBODY THERE BUT ME * * THERE WAS NOBODY THERE BUT ME * [KNOCKING ON DOOR] HELLO. HI. YOU GOT A BEAUTIFUL SWING, ROY. I'M A BEAUTIFUL GUY. LOOK, ROY, I CAME HERE TO APOLOGIZE, OK? FOR WHAT? WELL, YOU DID EXACTLY WHAT I SAID, AND I JUST POURED COLD WATER OVER YOUR EFFORTS, OK? I DIDN'T GET IT. I'M A, LIKE, TERRIBLE SHRINK PROBABLY. SHOULD'VE NEVER GOTTEN OUT OF REAL ESTATE. SHIT. ACTUALLY, I SHOULD'VE NEVER LEFT OHIO FOR THAT COWBOY IN AMARILLO, BUT-- HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TO AMARILLO? COWBOY? YEAH. IT'S NOT AS ROMANTIC WHEN YOU'RE ACTUALLY WITH ONE, TRUST ME. I MEAN, SO THE OILMAN IN DALLAS OR HOUSTON OR I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE WAS FROM. ANYWAY, HE JUST LOOKED GREAT AFTER THAT-- OH, BOY. THAT'S WHEN I WENT TO THE GULF, AND I ENDED UP IN, LIKE, TRAILER SALES, AND THEN ALL THOSE CONDOS IN CORPUS CHRISTI. THE BOTTOM JUST-- BOOM--FELL RIGHT OUT OF THE MARKET, AND I NEEDED A NEW GIG. A NEW GIG? THERAPY. I MEAN, I TOOK ALL THE CLASSES. I'M, YOU KNOW, LEGITIMATE, LEGAL, CERTIFIED. FUCK. I'M CERTIFIABLE. I'M REALLY SORRY, OK? OH, BOY. RAY, DO YOU MIND IF I HAVE A DOUGHNUT. THANKS. OK, LOOK. I AM REALLY FLATTERED THAT YOU ASKED ME OUT, BUT, I MEAN, I CAN'T ACCEPT BECAUSE I AM INVOLVED WITH DAVID, AND I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY EVIDENCE THAT HE TREATS OLD PEOPLE, CHILDREN, OR DOGS BADLY. LOOK, I ADMIT, AND I'M SORRY. I GUESS I GOT A LITTLE CARRIED AWAY WITH THE DAVID THING. I JUST SHOULD HAVE LAID UP AND MADE MY PAR. OK, ROY, I JUST WANT TO MAKE A PROPOSAL, ALL RIGHT? I MEAN, AS LONG AS YOU UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S STRICTLY PROFESSIONAL, AND THAT, YOU KNOW, WE'RE NOT GOING OUT TOGETHER. TEE IT UP. WELL, I THINK THAT I CAN HELP YOU WITH THE MENTAL ASPECTS OF THE GAME. I MEAN, YOU HAVE ROMEO TO BE YOUR SWING DOCTOR. I COULD BE YOUR HEAD DOCTOR. WHAT, ROY? WELL, YOU JUST SAID YOURSELF YOU'RE A CRUMMY SHRINK. WELL, I CAN IMPROVE, ROY. MOLLY, I DON'T EVEN HAVE THE MONEY TO PAY YOU. I'M BROKE. ROY, YOU DON'T NEED ANY MONEY TO PAY ME. WE'LL TRADE SERVICES. I MEAN, YOU KNOW, I'LL GIVE YOU MY SERVICES FOR GOLF LESSONS, AND I CAN HELP YOU THROUGH THE QUALIFYING, ROY, AND THEN IF YOU MAKE IT INTO THE OPEN, WELL... I'M ON MY OWN. YOU'LL BE WITH DAVID. YEAH. UH, I DON'T--I DON'T-- I DON'T REALLY WANT THIS.

WHENEVER ANYBODY SAYS THEY'RE WITH A REALLY GOOD PERSON, IT MEANS THEY'RE-- IT MEANS THEY'RE ABOUT TO LEAVE 'EM. YOU KNOW, YOU'RE AWFULLY JUDGMENTAL. WELL... IT'S ONE OF MY FEW REDEEMING VIRTUES. LOOK, DAVID'S INVOLVED IN A LOT OF CHARITY WORK. GETS HIS NAME IN THE PAPER. NO. ROY, NO. LET ME JUST FINISH. HE'S A SENSITIVE PERSON, AND A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T SEE IT. WELL, SO AM I. HELL, I'M-- SHIT, I'M TWICE AS SENSITIVE AS HE IS. I MEAN--HELL, I BROUGHT YOU TO THE RIVER. THAT'S A NATURE KIND OF THING, ISN'T IT? [CHUCKLES] YEAH, IT IS A NATURE KIND OF THING, ROY. IT IS A VERY NICE RIVER. THANK YOU, BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT. THE POINT IS IS THAT DAVID IS THERE FOR ME. OH, GOD. NOT THE "HE'S A VERY GOOD PERSON AND HE'S THERE FOR ME THING." LET ME BE YOUR SHRINK FOR A MINUTE. THAT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA. YOU'RE STARTIN' TO SOUND LIKE A WOMAN WHO'S LOOKIN' FOR A WAY OUT. WARM? THAT'S ENOUGH, ROY. OK. I'M SORRY. WE COULD KISS. OH, JEEZ, ROY.

ALL RIGHT, GOOD. NOW TAKE THIS LITTLE BALL, HIT IT THE HELL UP THE FAIRWAY. YOU'RE READY. [SIGHS] HOW'D I DO THAT? 'CAUSE YOU'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT SHANKING.

Jim Nantz: DAVID SIMMS IS THE FIRST-ROUND LEADER AT THE U.S. OPEN AFTER A BRILLIANT 67. CONGRATULATIONS, DAVID. WELL...JIM, I GOTTA TELL YOU, I'M THE LAST GUY ON THE PLANET THAT EXPECTED ME TO GO OUT THERE RIGHT OUT OF THE BLOCKS AND SHOOT A 67 TO LEAD THE OPEN. SHUT UP. Nantz: I'VE REALLY MARVELED AT HOW YOU'VE BEEN ABLE TO BALANCE THE SUPERB PLAY WITH ALL THE TIME AND ENERGY YOU GIVE TO... TO SO MANY CHARITIES AND ALL OF YOUR FANS, TOO.

WE'RE TELLING THEM IT'S EITHER THE COVER OR NO GO. Simms: OH, JESUS CHRIST. EXCUSE ME, MR. SIMMS. EXCUSE ME. WOULD YOU MIND GIVING OUR GRANDSON AN AUTOGRAPH? CAN I PLEASE HAVE YOUR AUTOGRAPH, MR. SIMMS? CAN YOU PEOPLE NOT SEE THAT I'M BUSY? I'M WORKING HERE. THIS IS MY OFFICE. DO I COME TO YOUR OFFICE AND ASK YOU FOR YOUR AUTOGRAPH? I DON'T THINK SO. JESUS. Simms: WHAT AN UGLY DOG.

HELLO, CUP. I HEARD THAT YOU PUT A MONSTER NUMBER UP THERE. YEAH, WELL, IT COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE. YOU KNOW, I PLAYED IN THE PRO-AM WITH SOME ASSHOLE MOVIE STAR HERE ONCE. SHOT AN 82. NOW, HOW IN THE WORLD... DID A GREAT BALL STRIKER LIKE YOURSELF... A LEGEND... MANAGE TO PUT UP AN 83? WELL, I MISSED A 4-FOOT PUTT ON 18 FOR AN 82. THAT'S HOW. AIN'T LIKE PLAYING SOME MUNI TRACK IN BROWNSVILLE, IS IT, BUCKO? AHEM. DOES, UH, INTEGRITY, TRADITION, AND HONOR INCLUDE KICKING A MAN WHEN HE'S DOWN? COME ON, MOLLY. THIS IS JUST GUY STUFF. IT'S JUST BAR TALK. NO OFFENSE. RIGHT, CUP? YOU KNOW, THIS MAN STILL HAS A LOT OF GREAT GOLF SHOTS IN HIS SYSTEM. Roy: MOLLY, IT'S OK. JUST GO AWAY. JUST--I DON'T NEED ANY ATTENTION RIGHT NOW. I'LL BET YOU $100 RIGHT NOW THAT ROY HERE CAN HIT A BALL THROUGH THAT DOOR, OVER THE PATIO, AND INTO THE RIVER. AND, HAROLD, GIVE ME A VODKA TONIC WITH A TWIST. MOLLY, HONEY... [CHUCKLES] REALLY, THIS ISN'T DIGNIFIED. OH. HA HA HA. OH, I'M SO SORRY. ROY. I JUST WANNA GO BACK TO TEXAS. WHAT ABOUT THE RIVER? THE PIRANHA, THE IMMORTALITY? ALL THAT BULLSHIT? YOU GONNA DRAG YOUR ASS HOME WITH AN 83? YOU KNOW, $200. FOR $200... I SAY THAT ROY CAN HIT THE BALL THROUGH THE DAMN BAR, OUT THE PATIO, INTO THE RIVER, AND MAKE THAT PELICAN RIGHT THERE FLY OFF ITS POST. Man: NO WAY. FROM RIGHT HERE. Simms: GOD ALMIGHTY. THIS IS RIDICULOUS. Romeo: HEY. HEY. HEY, YOU GOT THIS SHOT, PODS. YOU CAN DO-- IT'S A HOODED 4-IRON, MAN. YOU JUST TURN IT OVER, AND YOU START IT OFF LOW-- YOU CAN DO IT. HE CAN DO THIS SHOT.

THEN HE'S GOT TO GO THROUGH THE FRENCH DOORS, OVER THE UMBRELLAS, AND THEN CARRY 30 YARDS OF RIVER. HE'S GOT TO TRY TO POP THAT PELICAN RIGHT OFF ITS PERCH. KIND OF A THIN LIE, WOULDN'T YOU SAY? BEATS ALL THAT DEEP-SHIT ROUGH YOU WERE IN ALL DAY. Romeo: FORE! FORE IN THE BAR! COME ON, CLEAR IT AWAY! McCord: PELICAN'S ON THE OTHER SIDE. MAN, WHAT A TOUGH SHOT. I BETCHA HE'S GOTTA BE THINKING ABOUT THAT BRUTAL, EGO-SAPPING, MANHOOD-ROBBING... 83 HE BURIED HIMSELF UNDERNEATH TODAY. THAT'S AN AVALANCHE OF STROKES, A MUDSLIDE. ROMEO, YOU WANNA GET CONTROL OF THAT GUY? WILL YOU SHUT UP? GET DOWN. [WOMAN GASPS] Romeo: YES! YES! HA HA! DID YOU SEE THAT SHOT?! OH, MY GOD! THAT OUGHT TO COVER IT. YEAH. YOU KNOW... YOU'RE ALL FUCKING NUTS. YEAH. YEAH. YOU REALLY... LOOK GOOD. OH. * PUT YOUR COFFEES DOWN * * YOU BETTER STEP AROUND * * YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE TO GET THIS DONE * [WOMAN MOANING] * CLOSE AND LOCK THE DOOR * * DUCK DOWN TO THE FLOOR * * FORGET THE PHONE UNTIL YOU SEE THE SUN * [KNOCKING] * HEY, IT'S ALL RIGHT * * 'CAUSE YOU KNOW I'LL MAKE THIS FUN * * OH, WHEN WE SEE THE MORNING LIGHT * * WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WHERE WE STARTED FROM * * 'CAUSE THIS COULD TAKE ALL NIGHT * I KIND OF SHANKED THAT, HUH? NO, NO. HEY, COME ON, YOU GUYS. ROMEO! [GIGGLING] THIS IS NO TIME FOR A MARATHON! IT'S WET OUT HERE. DAMN. TEMPO IS EVERYTHING. MMM. PERFECTION IS... UNATTAINABLE. UNATTAINABLE. [SIGHS] [SIGHS] YOU KNOW, SOMEBODY SAID... GOLF AND SEX ARE THE ONLY TWO THINGS YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE GOOD AT TO ENJOY. REALLY? CAN I HAVE A MULLIGAN? A WHAT? A MULLIGAN. WHAT'S A MULLIGAN? OH. JUST HOLD STILL. DON'T MOVE. OH. AND I'LL SHOW YOU. IN FACT, WHY DON'T YOU GET ON TOP, AND I'LL SHOW YOU? MMM. TEE IT UP. COME ON, ROY! DAMN! * BABY, THIS COULD TAKE ALL NIGHT * * YEAH * Nantz: WELCOME, EVERYONE. JIM NANTZ WITH KEN VENTURI. THE SUN IS STRUGGLING TO COME OUT, THE COURSE IS DRYING UP, AND IN CASE YOU'RE JUST JOINING US, DAVID SIMMS IS TIED FOR THE LEAD IN THE CLUBHOUSE AT 5 UNDER PAR WITH PETER JACOBSEN. BUT THE REAL STORY TODAY, KENNY, INVOLVES A DRIVING-RANGE PRO FROM TEXAS WHO SHOT AN OPENING-ROUND 83 YESTERDAY, BUT NOW IS MAKING A RUN AT U.S. OPEN HISTORY. THE SINGLE-ROUND RECORD IN OPEN HISTORY IS IN JEOPARDY BECAUSE OF ROY "TIN CUP"... ANOTHER DRIVING-RANGE PRO, THAT'S ALL WE NEEDED. MORE OBSCURE GUYS. UNBELIEVABLE STORY. YES, HEROES IS WHAT I NEED. NOT OBSCURE DRIVING-RANGE PROS. OK, BEN, WE'RE BACK AT 16. QUICKLY. Wright: NOW, THIS PUTT, UH, HE'S STUDIED IT FROM EVERY ANGLE, AND I'M SURE HE KNOWS IT'S-- HE'S JUST GOT TO BE FIRM ON THE LEFT-HAND EDGE WITH THIS PUTT. ...THUMBNAILS ON THESE CLOWNS. I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE HE CAME FROM, BUT HERE HE IS GOING 10 UNDER IF HE MAKES IT. HE'S GETTING READY TO PUTT. Wright: LOOK AT THAT. SMOOTH AS SILK. MADE IT! 10 UNDER PAR FOR McAVOY. MAN ALIVE! THIS IS, UH... THE STUFF OF, UH, LEGEND, I WOULD SAY. WHO'S McAVOY? McAVOY? JOHN, YOU EVER HEARD OF THIS McAVOY GUY? ROY McAVOY AFTER A PAR AT 17, AN EAGLE TO SHOOT 60, ALTHOUGH NO ONE HAS KNOCKED IT ON THE GREEN IN 2 HERE TODAY. Venturi: THIS IS NOT A SHOT YOU REALLY WANNA GET AGGRESSIVE WITH. YOU GOTTA BE CONSERVATIVE. YOU GOTTA THINK THIS SHOT OUT. HE'S IN GREAT POSITION. WELL, IT'S A 3-SHOT PAR 5. ESPECIALLY TODAY, A LITTLE WIND IN THE FACE. JOHN DALY, IN FACT, ENDED UP IN THE WATER TRYING TO GO FOR THIS GREEN IN 2. Romeo: 237, MAN, TO CARRY THAT WATER. 237, MAN. 3-WOOD. Romeo: HIT THE HELL OUT OF IT. Venturi: YOU KNOW, JIMMY, HIS ADRENALINE MAY HAVE GOTTEN THE BETTER OF HIM. IF HE LAYS UP, HE TAKES BOGEY OUT OF PLAY. HE GOES FOR THE GREEN, HE BRINGS 6 IN, HE BRINGS 7 IN. BUT HE'S GOTTA REMEMBER, HE'S IN CONTENTION. HE HAS A CHANCE TO WIN THE U.S. OPEN. HE'S GOTTA PLAY SMART. WOW. NOPE. [MUMBLES IN SPANISH] Crowd: OHH! AW! AW! SHIT! Venturi: JIMMY, HE JUST DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH CLUB. WELL, WHAT THE HELL. YOU RIDE HER TILL SHE BUCKS YOU... OR YOU DON'T RIDE AT ALL. Nantz: IF HE CAN STILL KNOCK A WEDGE CLOSE AND MAKE PAR, IT WOULD CONCLUDE ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE TURNAROUNDS IN TOURNAMENT HISTORY. Venturi: HE'S GOT ABOUT 85 YARDS FROM HERE, JIM, AND THE DROP ZONE IS SHORT OF THE WATER. AND HE'LL NEED TO GET THIS ON THE UPPER LEVEL OF THIS MULTI-TERRACED GREEN. [CHEERING, APPLAUSE] NOW, THAT'S A GOOD SOLID SHOT LEAVING HIM ABOUT 12 FEET AWAY FOR PAR, A PAR AND 62, THE ALL-TIME OPEN ROUND RECORD. Venturi: GOOD STROKE. HE'S GOT IT. Nantz: UNBELIEVABLE! ROY McAVOY HAS DONE IT! YOU HAVE JUST SEEN THE GREATEST ROUND IN UNITED STATES OPEN HISTORY. 62. THE ALL-TIME LOWEST ROUND IN THE MAJORS DOESN'T BELONG TO A JACK NICKLAUS OR AN ARNOLD PALMER, NELSON, HOGAN, OR SNEAD. IT HAS BEEN SHOT BY THE MOST IMPROBABLE ARTIST OF ALL. ROY McAVOY HAS HIS SIGNATURE ON GOLF'S ALL-TIME MASTERPIECE ROUND. YOU KNOW, I GOT SOME MONEY FROM THE PELICAN BET. WHY DON'T WE GO SOMEWHERE FANCY AND CELEBRATE, GET READY FOR THE FINAL ROUND? [WHISTLES] THERE'S NOTHING TO CELEBRATE. BESIDES, THESE ARE MY PEOPLE, RIGHT? Waiter: THAT'S RIGHT. I'M A WAFFLE HOUSE GUY. GOTTA STAY IN TOUCH WITH THAT. PLUS, HE NEEDS HIS CARBOHYDRATES. Both: YEAH. PLUS, IF THE BOYS IN SALOME WERE IN TOWN, THIS IS WHERE THEY'D BE. OK. ALL RIGHT. Clint: YAY! THE LEGEND. GODDAMN, WE'VE BEEN ON A BUS FOR 2 DAYS, RIDING AROUND, RIDING AROUND. OH, GOD, IT'S SO GOOD TO SEE YOU. Romeo: IT'S SO GOOD TO SEE YOU. I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE GONNA COME. Dewey: SWEET 62! HEY, PUT THE TABLES TOGETHER. PUT THEM TOGETHER. Romeo: PUT THIS UP AND REST YOUR RUMP. DOES THIS FEEL LIKE HOME? Clint: YEAH. WE JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT WE ARE WITH YOU ALL THE WAY. DOREEN, UH, MEET DR. GRISWOLD. UH, THIS IS MOLLY. HI. SHE'S, UH, MY SHRINK. HI. WELL, EX-SHRINK, UM... WE'RE SLEEPING TOGETHER NOW, SO I CAN'T BE HIS THERAPIST. KNEW IT. THANKS. KNEW WHAT? OH, NOTHING. GOOD LUCK. YOU KNOW WHAT, GUYS? I HAVE GOT A LITTLE EXTRA CASH. WHY DON'T WE ALL JUST GO SOMEWHERE A LITTLE FANCY AND CELEBRATE? EXACTLY. WHY? WELL, IN HONOR OF, YOU KNOW-- THIS IS THE WAFFLE HOUSE, DOREEN. WELL, I KNOW, AND I LOVE THE WAFFLE-- I'VE BEEN DREAMING ABOUT WAFFLES FOR...1,800 MILES. YEAH, ME, TOO. THERE'S A WAFFLE HOUSE EXACTLY LIKE THIS IN ODESSA, TEXAS. YEAH. ODESSA? IT'S IN MIDLAND, AIN'T IT? NO, IT'S IN ODESSA. HONEY, IT'S IN ODESSA. I'M FROM ODESSA, AND IT'S IN ODESSA. I WAS BORN THERE, HONEY, AND THAT'S WHERE IT IS. TO THE MAN. TO THE CUP! TO THE CUP! TO THE CUP! YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT. YOU LOOK PARTICULARLY LOVELY TONIGHT, DOREEN. OH, WELL, THANK YOU. I DON'T KNOW IF ANYBODY EVER TOLD YOU, BUT YOU'RE REALLY A HELLUVA DANCER. REALLY? MM-HMM. YEAH, BUT THEY HAD ONE THERE. THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING. THEY HAD ONE THERE. WAIT, WAIT. IT WAS...ODESSA. THAT'S NOT WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT, AND YOU KNOW THE PLACE THAT WE STOPPED? LISTEN, THERE IS ONE EASY WAY TO FIGURE THIS OUT. YOU EVER TANGO? TANGO? MM-HMM. UH, NO. DO YOU? WELL, YOU KNOW... ROMEO, YOU DANCE? [MUTTERS] IT DOESN'T MATTER! IT DOESN'T GET MUCH BETTER THAN THIS. [CHUCKLES] Wright: WELL, THIS EXTRAORDINARY ROY McAVOY, HE JUST WON'T GO AWAY, THIS, UH, HUMBLE DRIVING RANGE PRO FROM...SALOME, WHEREVER THAT IS. LITTLE TOWN, WEST TEXAS. IT HASN'T BEEN DISCOVERED YET. OVER TO 18, GUYS, QUICKLY. KENNY, THIS IS JOHN COOK AT THE PAR 5 18th, NO STRANGER TO CHAMPIONSHIP PLAY. HE'S GONNA LAY UP WITH A 7-IRON. [APPLAUSE] MEANWHILE, HERE'S ROY McAVOY. Venturi: HE HAS THE SAME SHOT HE KNOCKED IN THE WATER YESTERDAY, JIMMY. THE THING TO DO RIGHT NOW IS TUNE OUT THE GALLERY SAYING, "GO FOR IT." HE'S NOW BACK IN CONTENTION, BUT HE MUST CONTINUE TO PLAY SMART. GIVE ME A 3-WOOD. Jimmy: WELL, HE'S PULLED THE 3-WOOD, AND HE CONTINUES TO PLAY THIS TOURNAMENT WITHOUT AN OUNCE OF FEAR. THAT IS JUST INEXPERIENCE, JUST PURE AND SIMPLE. THIS IS FOR VENTURI UP THERE IN THE BOOTH THINKING I SHOULD LAY UP. YEAH, WHAT DOES HE KNOW? HE ONLY WON THIS TOURNAMENT BEFORE YOU WERE BORN. DOLLAR BILLS. Venturi: CAUGHT IT A LITTLE BIT HIGH, A LITTLE BREEZE IN HIS FACE. THAT'S GOTTA GO, GOTTA GO. Jimmy: HE'S DONE IT AGAIN. NO, NOT AGAIN. HE HAS FOUND THE WATER FOR THE THIRD STRAIGHT DAY. WHAT WAS HE THINKING ABOUT? GIVE ME ANOTHER BALL. Romeo: ROY. WHAT? IT'S A WATER HAZARD. YOU GO UP THERE AND TAKE A DROP, TRY TO SAVE PAR, JUST LIKE YOU DID YESTERDAY. YOU'RE RIGHT. WHAT THE HELL WAS I THINKING? Director: HE'S TIED FOR THE LEAD, THIS ROY McAVOY, THIS TIN CUP, THIS EMPTY CUP, THIS AIRBRAIN OUT OF NOWHERE. WEST TEXAS. AND, UH, I--YEAH. THANK YOU FOR WEST TEXAS. YOU, UH, WENT FOR THE GREEN ON 18 TODAY. I'M JUST WONDERING IF YOU THINK THAT COST YOU. I SAVED PAR, DIDN'T I? WELL... DIDN'T I? I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE THINKING. YOU HAD THE SAME SHOT YESTERDAY ON 18 WITHOUT A HEADWIND-- YOU DON'T THINK I CAN KNOCK IT ON FROM THERE? LET'S JUST SAY IT'S A LOW-PERCENTAGE SHOT. WELL, SO AM I. I MEAN, LOOK AT ME, ALL RIGHT? LOOK WHAT I'M WEARING. I MEAN, I'M PLAYING FOR RIO GRANDE SHORT-HAUL TRUCKING, BRINK'S AND BROWN'S SANITATION, UH... FIRST STATE BANK OF SALOME, WOODY'S SMOKEHOUSE. YOU THINK A-- YOU THINK A GUY LIKE ME BOTHERS TO WORRY ABOUT THE PERCENTAGES? ARE YOU NERVOUS ABOUT TOMORROW, ROY? IT WON'T ALWAYS BE LIKE THIS, YOU KNOW. WHAT? WITH ME, SURROUNDED BY ALL THESE GUYS SNORIN', STRIPPER EX-GIRLFRIEND LAYIN' ACROSS FROM US... MY CADDY SLEEPIN' NEXT TO HER. [WHISPERING] It won't always be like this. Yes, it will, Roy. IT WILL. Dollar bills. DOLLAR BILLS. DOLLAR BILLS. FIRST UP, IN THE FINAL PAIRING, FROM SALOME, TEXAS, ROY McAVOY. FAIRWAYS AND GREENS, DAVE, AND DON'T FORGET TO WAVE AS I BLOW BY. YOU MEAN BLOW UP, DON'T YA, SPORT? YOU ALWAYS DO. [WHISPERING] Crowd: AWWW... [WHISPERING] Son of a... PLAYING OUT OF HOUSTON, TEXAS, DAVID SIMMS. IT'S OK. I KNOW EXACTLY WHERE YOU ARE. DON'T WORRY. YOU'RE IN GREAT SHAPE. WHAT KIND OF LIE WE GOT, BOSS? OH, SHIT. IT'S BURIED. UH-OH. ALL RIGHT. BE CAREFUL. DON'T--DON'T TOUCH IT. I KNOW THE RULES, ROMEO. WHICH WAY YA GONNA GO? GO RIGHT THROUGH THERE. GO FOR IT. Roy: NO! GOD! DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. IT WAS MY FAULT. I GAVE YOU THE WRONG CLUB. OK? YOU'LL BE FINE. YOU PUT A GOOD MOVE ON THE BALL. YOU REALLY-- NOW, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. HERE--YOU DID FINE. GIVE ME THE CLUB. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, JIM. WE'VE JUST HEARD THAT ROY McAVOY HAS TAKEN A DISASTROUS DOUBLE BOGEY TO OPEN HIS FINAL ROUND HERE. AH, DOUBLE BACK THERE, ROY. JUST KEEP MAKIN' PARS, ASSHOLE. I'LL TAKE 18 OF 'EM, ALL DAY LONG. DO IT, AND I'LL OWN YA. [SPECTATORS CLAPPING] Roy: FORE! ROY McAVOY'S 2nd SHOT AT THE 2nd HOLE HAS GONE DEEP INTO THE WOODS. FOR A REPORT ON HIS PLIGHT, LET'S GO DOWN TO GARY McCORD, WHO HAS SPENT MOST OF HIS LIFE IN THE WOODS AND IN DARKNESS. GARY? BEN, HE'S IN JAIL HERE. NO CHANCE FOR PAROLE. IN FACT, THE ONLY THING HE'S GOT-- HE'S GOT TO HIT THE BALL BACK IN THE FAIRWAY, TRY TO PITCH BALL ON THE GREEN, AND GET UP AND DOWN FOR HIS PAR. HE'S GOT NO CHANCE TO HIT IT ON THE GREEN. 50 BUCKS SAYS I KNOCK IT ON FROM HERE WITH A 7-IRON. ON THE GREEN? RIGHT ON THE GREEN. YOU GOT IT. MARSHA, YOU WANT TO MOVE THESE PEOPLE BACK RIGHT HERE? I'M GOIN' RIGHT THERE. Director: McCORD, WHAT YOU GOT? WHAT'S HE DOING? BEN, I THINK HE'S GONNA TRY THE OLD RICOCHET OFF THE PORT-A-LET WITH A HOODED 7-IRON. HE IS! HE'S GONNA HIT IT RIGHT OFF THE SHITTER! Director: I CANNOT BELIEVE HE'S ABOUT TO HIT THIS SHOT. DAVE, V.T. 1, RECORD, RECORD. RECORD THIS SHOT. HEY! Ben Wright: ROY McAVOY HAS BANKED HIS 3rd SHOT AT THE 2nd HOLE BETWEEN THE TREES, OFF A WATER CLOSET-- TOILET OR LOO, AS YOU MIGHT CALL IT-- AND GOT IT ON THE GREEN, SOMEHOW, IN 3. IT MAY BE THE SHOT, THOUGH, THAT DOES GET HIM RIGHT BACK ON TRACK HERE IN THIS FINAL ROUND. IT COULD ERASE THAT DOUBLE BOGEY AT 1. IT MAY BE THE BEST THING THAT EVER HAPPENED TO HIM. [CROWD CHEERS AND APPLAUDS] OH, THAT WAS GREAT. I DIDN'T KNOW THERE WAS A LITTLE MIRROR THING IN HERE. ISN'T THIS CUTE? HERE. LET ME JUST LOOK AT MY... LOOKS PRETTY LEVEL. JUST ROLL IT IN LIKE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOIN'. HIT IT CLOSE, SPORT. YES! YES! YAAH! DOREEN, HOW DID HE GET THE NAME "TIN CUP"? OH, HE WAS THE CATCHER ON THE HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL TEAM. THE STAR PITCHER HAD A BIG LEAGUE CURVE. NOT ALL HIS PITCHES HIT ROY IN THE MITT. OUCH. TEAM THOUGHT "TIN CUP" WAS A WHOLE LOT BETTER THAN "CLANK." CLANK... FUCK. Doreen: MOLLY, CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION? SURE. HAVE YOU EVER HAD A LATIN LOVER? WHERE DOES HE GET HIS NAME FROM IS WHAT I WANNA KNOW. Doreen: WHY DID YOU WAIT SO LONG TO LEAVE THAT SIMMS CHARACTER? WELL, IT TAKES A LITTLE WHILE TO REALIZE THAT PRINCE CHARMING MIGHT BE WEARING A BEER-STAINED UNDERSHIRT WITH A SAUSAGE HANGIN' OUT OF HIS MOUTH, MAKIN' $7.00 AN HOUR IN SOME ARMADILLO-INFESTED DRIVING RANGE. YOU'RE NOT ONE OF THESE WOMEN WHO TRIES TO FIX MEN, I HOPE. I MEAN, MEN CANNOT BE FIXED AND ESPECIALLY HIM. YEAH. WELL, I'VE BEEN PATHETICALLY SLOW LEARNING THAT LESSON. MOLLY. HEY. HI. HOW ARE YA? GOOD. HEY, I COULD USE A LITTLE HELP, I THINK. YOU KNOW, I'VE SEEN WHAT YOU'VE DONE WITH McAVOY AND ALL THAT PSYCHOLOGICAL STUFF. I THINK IT COULD COME IN PRETTY HANDY. WELL, HEY! LET ME GIVE YOU MY CARD. SURE. SUPER. ACTUALLY, IF YOU GOT A FEW MORE OF THESE, THERE'S A BUNCH OF GUYS IN THE LOCKER ROOM COULD USE YOUR HELP AS WELL. YOU KNOW WHAT? TAKE 'EM ALL. THANKS. THIS IS DOREEN. HI. I'M DOREEN. AND, YOU KNOW, MY NUMBER'S RIGHT THERE. JUST CALL ME ANYTIME. I DO COUNSEL COUPLES, SO IF YOU WANT TO BRING YOUR CADDY, THAT'D BE JUST FINE. YEAH, I'LL THINK ABOUT IT, AND I'LL GIVE YOU A CALL. OK. BYE. NICE MEETIN' YOU. CHEERS. OH. CHEERS. YES! HO! BOOM. Director: THAT PUTS JACOBSEN INTO A TIE AT 7, GUYS, AND THAT, UH, TIN CUP GUY IS 1 SHOT BACK. LET'S KEEP ABREAST OF THAT. Jim Nantz: THAT BIRDIE BY PETER JACOBSEN FORGED A TIE NOW FOR THE LEAD AT 7 UNDER WITH DAVID SIMMS. AND ROY McAVOY JUST WON'T GO AWAY. HE'S ONLY 1 SHOT BACK AT 6 UNDER PAR. MAN, HE'S THROWIN' DARTS BACK THERE. IF WE DON'T MAKE SOME BIRDIES, WE'RE PLAYIN' FOR 2nd. McAVOY? YOU BELIEVE HE'S STILL HANGIN' AROUND? IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT A GUY NAMED TIN CUP MIGHT HAVE HIS NAME BENEATH MINE ON THE TROPHY. Jim Nantz: SO IT'S COME DOWN TO THE 72nd HOLE OF THIS GREAT CHAMPIONSHIP, AND 3 MEN, ALL BATTLING TO BE CROWNED THE NEXT OPEN CHAMPION. PETER JACOBSEN IS IN THE FAIRWAY AT 18 AT 8 UNDER PAR, TIED FOR THE LEAD WITH ROY McAVOY, WHO'S ON THE 18th TEE. AND DAVID SIMMS IS BACK THERE TRAILING BY 1. JACOBSEN'S LAYIN' UP. YEAH, HE TOOK OUT AN IRON. Ken Venturi: JACOBSEN'S GONNA LAY UP, JIM, AND I THINK THAT'S A VERY SMART MOVE. HE'S TIED FOR THE LEAD, VIRTUALLY ASSURES HIMSELF OF A PAR. AND WITH HIS SHORT GAME, HE COULD MAKE BIRDIE. YOU AIN'T GONNA HAVE THAT LUXURY, DAVE. NOT IF YOU PLAY TO WIN. Jim Nantz: WELL, WE'VE SEEN THIS POSITION BEFORE. McAVOY WITH ANOTHER PERFECT DRIVE AT THE 18th. THE LAST THING HE NEEDS RIGHT NOW, JIM, IS AN EXCUSE TO GO FOR THE GREEN AGAIN. I DIDN'T CATCH IT ALL. THAT'S OK. YOU HAVE TO LAY UP, THEN.
