BY WHOM? SOME INDIANS. Danny: RELATIVES? ONLY ON MY FATHER'S SIDE. STOP IT, JUDY. YOU'RE BEING RIDICULOUS. ALL RIGHT. DO YOU WANT TO HEAR THE HONEST TRUTH? YES. YES, GO ON. WELL, IT'S LIKE THIS. IT'S HIM! YOU SEE, I SAVED HIS LIFE, AND HE WAS SO GRATEFUL-- SO GRATEFUL THAT HE BOUGHT YOU EXTRAVAGANT CLOTHES, EXPENSIVE APARTMENTS? THAT'S RIGHT. ISN'T IT? OF COURSE IT IS. THERE. WHY DON'T YOU STOP LYING? I'VE HEARD OF THINGS LIKE THIS HAPPENING TO OTHER GUYS WHILE THEY WERE AWAY, BUT I DIDN'T THINK IT COULD HAPPEN TO ME. I KEPT THINKING YOU WERE DIFFERENT. DAY AFTER DAY AND NIGHT AFTER NIGHT, IT WAS THE ONE THOUGHT THAT KEPT ME GOING. DANNY, PLEASE LISTEN TO ME. I CAN-- NO, THANKS! I'VE HEARD ENOUGH. [WHISPERS] Danny. [DOOR SLAMS] HOW DID YOU MAKE UP THAT STORY ABOUT IT BEING ME? HOW COULD I TELL HIM THE TRUTH WHEN I DON'T EVEN KNOW IT MYSELF? WHY DIDN'T YOU SHOW HIM THE LETTER? FINE. THEN HE'D THINK THE WORST. THE LETTER SAYS I'VE BEEN "VERY ACCOMMODATING." OH, IF ONLY HE'D COME HOME YESTERDAY. I'M SORRY THIS HAPPENED. MAYBE I COULD HELP YOU TO FIND OUT WHO HE IS. BUT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, POP. YOU SEE, I THINK I KNOW WHO IT IS. OH, YOU DO? YES, MY BOSS. BILLINGSLEY? AND THE WORST OF IT IS, I HAVE TO GO TO HIM SO DANNY GETS THE JOB AT THE STORK. JUDY, PROMISE ME YOU WON'T DO ANYTHING WE'LL BOTH BE SORRY FOR. WHAT DO YOU THINK I AM? DON'T ANSWER THAT. ANY CALLS? JUDY OF THE CLOAKROOM IS HERE TO SEE YOU. OH. WELL, OK. TELL HER TO COME IN. SIT DOWN, JUDY. I'LL BE RIGHT WITH YOU. [WHISTLING] IS ANYTHING WRONG? NOT YET. WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU? NOTHING. EVERYTHING'S FINE. YOU'VE BEEN VERY NICE TO ME, AND I APPRECIATE IT. IT'S NOTHING. OH, NO? CERTAINLY NOT. LOOK, SHERM-- MR. BILLINGSLEY-- THAT'S RIGHT ABOUT MY BEING UNDER NO OBLIGATION, ISN'T IT? YOUR ONLY OBLIGATION TO ME IS TO BE ON TIME AND DO YOUR WORK PROPERLY. I DON'T GET IT. THERE IS ONE THING, HOWEVER. WHAT? WE'LL GET ALONG MUCH BETTER WITHOUT THESE SURPRISE VISITS. I GET IT. OH, I ALMOST FORGOT WHAT I CAME HERE TO TELL YOU. WHAT'S THAT? I HAVE A LITTLE SUGGESTION. IS IT ABOUT THE CHECKROOM? NO. IT'S ABOUT-- DON'T BOTHER, THEN. I WANT TO MAKE A DEAL WITH YOU. YOU TAKE CARE OF THE CHECKROOM AND LET ME RUN THE STORK CLUB. DO YOU MIND? COME IN, MISS PATTEN. PARDON ME. WELL, MIS PEABODY, WHEN DOES MY BAND OPEN AT THE STORK? IT DOESN'T. I MEAN IT ISN'T-- NO? THE WAY YOU TWO CAME OUT JUST NOW, I THOUGHT WE WERE ALL SET. DANNY, DON'T JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS. ARE YOU SERIOUS? THERE ARE SOME CIRCUMSTANCES-- I'LL SAY THERE ARE, BUT YOU'RE NOT GONNA INVOLVE ME IN THEM. I COME BACK AND FIND YOU AT THE YORK TOWERS, DRESSED LIKE SOMETHING OUT OF "VOGUE," IN THE COMPANY OF AN OLD MAN YOU CAN'T EXPLAIN, AND NOW I SEE YOU WITH THE BOSS' ARM AROUND YOU. SOME CIRCUMSTANCES. HA HA. IT DOES LOOK KIND OF FUNNY, DOESN'T IT? NOT TO ME, IT DOESN'T. DANNY, YOU'RE WALKING OUT ON A GIRL WHO'S NO DIFFERENT THAN SHE EVER WAS. THERE'LL COME A TIME WHEN YOU'LL FIND THAT OUT. THEN HOW WILL YOU FEEL? WHEN I FIND THAT OUT, I'LL LET YOU KNOW. THANK YOU. NO MATTER HOW I FIGURE IT OUT, I ALWAYS COME BACK TO THE SAME THING. WHAT'S THAT? I LOVE HIM. I GATHERED THAT. I JUST CAN'T LET HIM LOSE HIS BAND AND ME IN THE BARGAIN. HOW'S HE GONNA KEEP THE GUYS IF HE CAN'T GET A JOB? MAYBE HE CAN'T KEEP THEM, BUT I CAN. HOW'S THAT AGAIN? YOU WAIT AND SEE. WHEN WE KNOCK OFF HERE, WE'RE GOING OVER WHERE HE'S REHEARSING. I WAS HOPING WE COULD GO SHOPPING AGAIN. I COULD USE A NEW GIRDLE. WHO COULDN'T? GEE, WHAT A BAND! THAT'S JIMMY JONES ON THE DRUMS. OK, TAKE 5. JIMMY! GWEN! YOU STOOD ME UP THE LAST TIME WE HAD A DATE. THAT WAS 3 YEARS AGO. WHAT HAPPENED? WELL, I'LL TELL YOU. I WAS STANDING ON THE CORNER. A MILITARY BAND WENT BY, AND THE NEXT THING I KNEW, I WAS IN CAMP ROBERTS. I'LL GIVE YOU ONE MORE CHANCE. MEET ME TONIGHT ON THE SAME CORNER. YOU GOT A DEAL. Judy: DANNY. CAN I SEE YOU A MINUTE? OK. THE BAND IS SWELL, DANNY. THANKS. AND IF YOU OPEN IN A GOOD SPOT, YOUR FORTUNE IS MADE. THAT'S RIGHT. YOU LIKE RICH GUYS, DON'T YOU? WHAT KIND OF A CRACK IS THAT? THIS IS A WASTE OF TIME, JUDY. BUT I'M IN A SPOT TO HELP YOU KEEP THE BAND TOGETHER. THANKS. I'LL FIND A WAY TO DO THAT. NOW YOU RUN ALONG, WILL YOU? NO, I WON'T. I'M GONNA GET SORE IN A MINUTE. I'M SORE NOW. THIS IS VERY EMBARRASSING. DON'T BLUSH SO EASY. YOU OUGHT TO. GET SMART. I'M LOADED LIKE A TRANSPORT. WILL YOU BLOW? IT'S LEND LEASE. DON'T BE A CHUMP. NO. WELL, THANKS, JUDY. NICE OF YOU TO DROP IN ON US. DON'T MENTION IT, DANNY. WELL, FELLAS, YOU'RE ALL SET. FROM NOW ON, YOU HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. YOU'RE ALL MOVING IN THE YORK TOWERS AS MY GUESTS TILL YOU GET IN THE RIGHT SPOT. SAY, THAT SOUNDS FINE. HEY, NOW WAIT A MINUTE. DANNY THOUGHT MAYBE YOU FELLAS WOULDN'T LIKE IT. WHY NOT? TELL US MORE. NOTHING DOING. I WON'T STAND FOR IT. CAN YOU MAKE US A BETTER OFFER? NO, BUT WE'LL GET STARTED EVENTUALLY, AND-- NEVER MIND THAT. I'M ALL FOR IT. WHAT DO YOU GUYS SAY? [ALL TALKING AT ONCE] SWELL. [KNOCK ON DOOR] POP, WE'RE GONNA HAVE COMPANY. I'LL PUT ME SHOES ON. "THE WALL STREET JOURNAL"? POP, YOU SLAY ME. YOU SEEM IN MIGHTY GOOD SPIRITS. IN A WAY I AM. I'D LIKE TO SPEAK TO THE MANAGER-- MR. GRAY. YOU MADE IT UP WITH THE YOUNG MAN? NO, POP. THAT'S ALL OFF. AH, THAT'S A PITY. MR. GRAY, THIS IS MISS PEABODY. IS THE APARTMENT NEXT TO MINE STILL VACANT? IT IS? HOW MANY ROOMS IS IT? 12. THAT'S FINE. I'LL TAKE IT. YOU CAN CHARGE IT TO MY ACCOUNT. OH, IN ABOUT AN HOUR. OPERATOR, WILL YOU CONNECT ME WITH LOCKE'S FIFTH AVENUE? NOW WHAT ARE YOU UP TO? I'M GOING TO RUIN BILLINGSLEY OR SOMEBODY. LOCKE'S? MEN'S DEPARTMENT, PLEASE. I'LL SHOW HIM! I'LL SMOKE HIM OUT. I'LL SPEND EVERY CENT HE'S GOT. BUT WHY? HE RUINED MY LOVE AFFAIR, THAT'S WHY. MEN'S DEPARTMENT? THIS IS MISS JUDY PEABODY AT THE YORK TOWERS. COULD YOU SEND A REPRESENTATIVE UP TO MY APARTMENT TO MEASURE 12 MEN FOR DINNER JACKETS, TROPICALS, AND A HALF-DOZEN BUSINESS SUITS APIECE. THEN THERE WILL BE SHOES, SHIRTS, AND COLLARS AND TIES BESIDES. THAT'S FINE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WHAT HAVE I DONE? POP, DID YOU HURT YOURSELF? WHAT? WHEN YOU BUMPED INTO THE WALL JUST NOW. DID I BUMP INTO THE WALL? WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK? JUDY, I MUST TELL YOU SOMETHING. I AM A BA-- NOW, DON'T TELL ME YOU'RE LEAVING AGAIN. I THINK BOTH OF US SHOULD LEAVE. NOT ME. I'M AFTER SOMEBODY'S SCALP, AND I WON'T REST TILL I GET IT. BUT, JUDY, IT'S MY SCALP. YOU MUST HAVE HIT YOUR HEAD. WHY DON'T YOU GO LIE DOWN? JUDY, YOU MUST BELIEVE ME. I'M A RICH MAN. I HOPED TO BRING A LITTLE HAPPINESS INTO YOUR LIFE BECAUSE YOU SAVED MINE, BUT, ME GOOD GIRL, YOUR KIND OF HAPPINESS IS MORE THAN I CAN AFFORD. WHY DON'T YOU STOP IT, POP? I THOUGHT OF THAT ONE AHEAD OF YOU. CALL CURTIS. FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF. YEAH. HE WOULD KNOW. I WANT TO TALK TO HIM ANYWAY. HIS NUMBER'S RECTOR-21098. YOU READ THAT ON HIS LETTER TO ME. CALL HIM. CALL HIM. GET ME RECTOR-21098, PLEASE. [INTERCOM BUZZES] WELL? OH, YEAH. PUT HER ON. HELLO, MISS PEABODY. HOW ARE YOU? YES. UH-HUH. OF COURSE, OF COURSE. ALL RIGHT. I'LL BE RIGHT UP. NOW EITHER YOU'RE CRAZY, OR I'M GOING TO BE. WE'LL SOON FIND OUT. [KNOCK ON DOOR] COME IN. SORRY TO INTRUDE. YOU'RE NOT INTRUDING! I HAVE THE KEY, AND WE'RE ALL SET. THERE'S ONLY ONE THING I'D LIKE TO MAKE CLEAR TO YOU. I'M ACCEPTING YOUR HOSPITALITY BECAUSE I HAVE TO, BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT YOU'RE GONNA GET EVERY CENT BACK. EVERY CENT, DO YOU UNDERSTAND? YES, DANNY. YOUNG MAN, I LIKE YOU. I LIKE YOUR IDEAS. I LIKE THE WAY YOU TALK. I LIKE EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU. I WISH I COULD RETURN THE COMPLIMENT. GOOD-BYE. A FINE LAD. YES. THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S THE MATTER WITH HIM. [DOORBELL RINGS] I'LL GET IT, POP. ARE YOU MR. CURTIS? YES, MISS PEABODY. COME ON. THANK YOU. J.B.: WELL, IT TOOK YOU LONG ENOUGH TO GET HERE. NOW, SIR, TELL THIS YOUNG LADY WHO I AM. WHY, I NEVER SAW YOU BEFORE IN MY LIFE. HUP! IS HE ANNOYING YOU? YES, HE IS. HE TOLD ME A TERRIBLE LIE. I TOLD HER WHO I WAS. I EXPECT YOU TO CONFIRM IT. I THINK THE POOR OLD CHAP'S DEMENTED. COME ON. YOU BETTER GET OUT OF HERE, OLD MAN. OH, NO. I DON'T MIND IF HE STAYS HERE. I JUST WISH HE'D BEHAVE HIMSELF. WHAT DID HE DO? WILL YOU OR WILL YOU NOT TELL HER WHO I AM? PLEASE. IF YOU'RE NOT SURE WHO YOU ARE, DON'T ADVERTISE THE FACT. OHH! MR. CURTIS, I'M TRYING TO FIND OUT WHO'S KEEPING ME. WELL, YOU MUSTN'T DO THAT. YOUR BENEFACTOR'S A VERY GENEROUS MAN, BUT HE WANTS TO STAY UNKNOWN. I'LL FIND OUT WHO HE IS SOME WAY. I DON'T THINK YOU WILL, MISS PEABODY. IS IT YOU? NO. I PAY THE BILLS, THOUGH, AND YOU CAN GO RIGHT AHEAD AND DO ANYTHING THAT'S GOING TO MAKE YOU HAPPY. OHH! J.B.: UMM. WELL, WHOEVER HE IS, I'LL BREAK HIM IF IT'S THE LAST THING I DO! THAT WILL TAKE QUITE A BIT OF DOING, MISS PEABODY. GOOD-BYE. GOOD-BYE. CURTIS! HIYA, J.B. OH, YOU KNOW ME NOW. HOW DARE YOU SAY YOU DIDN'T KNOW ME? WELL, YOU TOLD ME NOT TO LET HER KNOW WHO YOU ARE. NEVER MIND WHAT I TELL YOU TO DO. YOU DO WHAT I TELL YOU. ALL RIGHT. I'LL TRY TO REMEMBER THAT. THAT GIRL'S OUT TO BREAK ME. HOW CAN SHE, J.B.? SHE'S ORGANIZED. LOOK. YOU'RE SOLVENT. WHAT CAN IT COST YOU? $200,000 OR $300,000 AND, OF COURSE, THE GIFT TAX. GIFT TAX? WHAT'S THAT? WELL, IF YOU'D EVER GIVEN ANYTHING AWAY BEFORE, YOU'D KNOW. EVERY TIME YOU GIVE ANYONE OVER $3,000, YOU HAVE TO HAND THE GOVERNMENT ANOTHER 30%. COOLIDGE. OH, FOR ANOTHER COOLIDGE. AFTER YOU, J.B. I WOULDN'T RIDE IN THE SAME CAR WITH YOU. I'LL WALK DOWN! WELL, DID YOU ENJOY YOUR STROLL, J.B.? WELL, AT ANY RATE, IT GAVE ME TIME TO THINK THINGS OVER. YOU KNOW, YOU COULD HAVE WALKED DOWN ONE FLIGHT AND TAKEN THE ELEVATOR AT THE NEXT FLOOR. I WAS SO MAD, I NEVER THOUGHT OF IT. WELL, I'M GLAD YOU'RE FEELING BETTER ANYWAY. TOM, I LOVE THAT GIRL JUDY DEARLY. SHE REMINDS ME OF EDITH WHEN I WAS COURTING HER, BUT I CAN'T BEAR TO SEE MONEY SPENT FOOLISHLY, PARTICULARLY MINE. WELL, I THOUGHT YOU WANTED TO MAKE HER HAPPY. I DID. IT'S MAKING HER MISERABLE. HOW? SHE HAS HER HEART SET ON A HORN TOOTER. WHAT KIND OF FELLA IS HE? AN INDEPENDENT KIND OF CHAP. I LIKE HIM. WELL, GET THEM MARRIED. THEN YOU'RE OFF THE HOOK. CURTIS, MUCH AS I HATE TO ADMIT IT, I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT, BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE EASY. WHY NOT? HE'S JEALOUS OF ME. JEALOUS OF YOU? HA HA! YEAH. I'D USE THE ELEVATOR IF YOU WANT TO GET THERE TONIGHT. AHEM. JUDY. YES? I WANT TO ASK YOUR FORGIVENESS. I DON'T KNOW WHATEVER POSSESSED ME TO ACT LIKE I DID. NEITHER DO I. HOW COULD YOU MAKE UP SUCH A LIE? WHAT WAS THE POINT? I GUESS ME POOR OLD BRAIN ISN'T WHAT IT USED TO BE. POP, I'M SORRY. BUT I STILL HAVE ME LUCID MOMENTS, AND IF YOU LET ME STAY AROUND WITH YOU, I'LL HELP YOU BRING DANNY BACK TO HIS SENSES. OH, POP, IF WE ONLY COULD. I BEG YOUR PARDON. DON'T LET ME INTERRUPT YOU. OH, POP! WELL, THAT'S THE WAY THINGS STAND, DANNY. I CAN'T PLACE YOU FOR AT LEAST TWO WEEKS, BUT I'M WILLING TO STAKE YOU AND THE BOYS IN THE MEANTIME. WE'RE BEING STAKED NOW. THE GUYS ARE GETTING OTHER OFFERS FROM BANDS THAT ARE WORKING. I CAN'T HOLD THEM TOGETHER TWO WEEKS LONGER. THAT'S A TOUGH BREAK, BUT KEEP IN TOUCH WITH ME, THOUGH. YOU NEVER CAN TELL. YEAH, I WILL. SO LONG. THANKS, BARNEY. [BAND WARMING UP] HEY, FELLAS, LET'S GIVE THIS NUMBER A QUICK GOING OVER BEFORE DANNY GETS BACK. HE'LL NEVER KNOW THE DIFFERENCE. SUPPOSING HE DOES. HE'D GET SORE. WELL, AREN'T YOU GONNA SING WITH THE BAND? NO. THAT'S ALL OFF. HE TOLD YOU? WELL, NOT IN SO MANY WORDS. HE JUST ACTS THAT WAY. WELL, GO AHEAD AND SING, JUDY. I'D LIKE TO HEAR YOU MESELF. MAYBE HE HAS A REASON YOU DON'T SUSPECT. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? I'LL TELL YOU AFTER I HEAR YOU SING. OK, FELLAS, HIT IT!

BESIDES, IT'S A TERRIFIC KICK FOR ME TO HAVE JUDY COME THROUGH LIKE THIS. IT JUST GOES TO PROVE YOU CAN GET SO USED TO A PERSON DOING ONE THING THAT YOU FAIL TO REALIZE THEY CAN DO ANYTHING ELSE. CAN YOU UNDERSTAND THAT, MR. WILTON? OH, SURE, SURE. I UNDERSTAND IT VERY WELL. I'M PROUD OF YOU, JUDY. THANK YOU, MR. BILLINGSLEY. YOU HAVEN'T HEARD THE BEST YET. SING THE WALTZ FOR HIM, JUDY. NOTHING DOING. NO WALTZES. THERE'S NEVER BEEN A WALTZ PLAYED IN THE STORK CLUB. HUH. CAN'T BE MUCH OF A PLACE. THE STORK CLUB WAS BUILT ON SOFT, PEPPY MUSIC, AND IT NEVER STOPS. THAT'S WHY I HAVE 3 ORCHESTRAS, UNDERSTAND? OH, HE UNDERSTANDS! GOOD. YOU OPEN TOMORROW NIGHT, SO COME AND SEE ME IN THE MORNING, MR. WILTON. WE'LL MAKE A DEAL AND SIGN THE CONTRACTS. HE'LL BE THERE, MR. BILLINGSLEY! OH, UH, AND BY THE WAY, JUDY, I'D KNOW THAT VOICE OF YOURS ANYWHERE. BESIDES, I WAS SITTING WITH MR. WINCHELL WHEN YOU PHONED. GOOD NIGHT, ALL. DANNY, WE'RE IN! OH, DANNY, ISN'T IT WONDERFUL? I DON'T THINK SO. THAT'S WHAT YOU WANTED, ISN'T IT? YEAH, BUT I DON'T LIKE THE WAY I GOT IT. WHY NOT? WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT, SON? WELL, I DON'T THINK A BAND WAS EVER ENGAGED UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES BEFORE-- AN EXPENSIVE APARTMENT TO REHEARSE IN, ALL THE FOOD YOU WANT TO EAT, THE BOSS ARRIVES FOR A NICE, COZY AUDITION, AND WE'RE HIRED. WELL, WHAT COULD BE SWEETER? I DON'T WANT ANY PART OF IT. NOW, LOOK, DANNY. YOU CAN'T LET PERSONAL FEELINGS DO US OUT OF THE BEST JOB IN TOWN. THAT'S RIGHT, DANNY. NO, AND I WON'T LET HIM. I KNOW HOW DANNY FEELS, AND MAYBE HE HAS A RIGHT TO, MAYBE HE HASN'T. THAT'S BETWEEN US. THESE GUYS HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. YOU AND THE BAND HAVE TO STICK TOGETHER. WE DON'T. YOU SEE, DANNY, I CAN LEAVE WITH A CLEAR CONSCIENCE. YOU COULDN'T. WELL, I'VE GOT EVERYTHING I COULD ASK FOR. SINGING WITH YOUR BAND WOULD JUST BE AN ANTICLIMAX. I'M THE ONE THAT'S BOWING OUT. MAYBE THIS IS BESIDE THE POINT, BUT IF YOU EVER REALLY FALL IN LOVE, YOU'LL TRUST THE GIRL. AW, GEE, HONEY, DON'T CRY. EVERYTHING WILL BE ALL RIGHT. WHY DO GIRLS ALWAYS HAVE TO GO FOR DUMB GUYS? MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE IT MAKES US LOOK SMART. WELL, I AM SMART! MAYBE I'VE BEEN ACTING LIKE I'M DUMB, BUT I'VE GOT A BRAIN SOMEWHERE IN MY HEAD, AND I'M GONNA USE IT! JUDY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I'M GONNA SEND THESE THINGS BACK WHERE THEY CAME FROM. OH, WHY? NOBODY CAN BUY ME. THERE'S ISN'T ENOUGH MONEY TO MAKE ME FORGET WHO I AM! I'VE GOT CHARACTER, I HAVE! I'M NOT SO EASILY TEMPTED. I CAN'T BE BOUGHT BY A FEW MEASLY-- NO, SIR! I'VE GOT BRAINS! OHH! [INTERCOM BUZZES] YES? Woman: JUDY PEABODY TO SEE YOU. OH, FINE. SEND HER IN. WELL, GOOD MORNING, JUDY. I'VE GOT A LITTLE SURPRISE FOR YOU. I DON'T WANT ANY MORE SURPRISES! WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU? WE CAN'T GO ON LIKE THIS, MR. BILLINGSLEY. LIKE WHAT? I'M IN LOVE WITH DANNY. WELL, THAT'S ALL RIGHT WITH ME. WELL, IT'S NOT WITH HIM. YOU'RE ALL MIXED UP. I KNOW I AM, AND I DON'T WANT TO BE. HE'S AS JEALOUS AS-- JEALOUS? WELL, CERTAINLY. WHO WOULDN'T BE AFTER ALL THE THINGS YOU'VE GIVEN ME? I'VE GIVEN YOU? OH, SHERMAN, DON'T BE SO ANONYMOUS. SAY, LISTEN. I'M A MARRIED MAN. THAT'S WHY YOU OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF. OH, I'VE GOT TO GET YOU STRAIGHTENED OUT. NOW, GET THIS. I NEVER GAVE YOU ANYTHING EVER. HUH? WHY SHOULD I? WHAT ARE YOU IN MY LIFE? WELL, I DON'T KNOW, BUT SOMEBODY'S BEHIND THIS. I KNOW THIS FELLA CURTIS. HE COMES TO THE STORK A LOT. HE WON'T TALK, THOUGH. I'VE ASKED HIM TO TELL ME. WELL, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT TOO MUCH, JUDY. I'VE BEEN IN THIS TOWN FOR YEARS, AND NOBODY EVER GIVES ANYTHING AWAY FOR LONG WITHOUT LETTING YOU KNOW WHY. YOU JUST SIT TIGHT. YOU'RE A CLEVER GIRL. STICK TO YOUR SINGING. IT'S YOUR REAL FUTURE. BUT I CAN'T SING WITH THE BAND THE WAY THINGS ARE BETWEEN DANNY AND ME. WELL, EITHER YOU DO, OR I DON'T WANT THE BAND. OH, I'LL OPEN TONIGHT. DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT. ATTAGIRL. WE'LL BE VERY HAPPY TOGETHER. I UNDERSTAND, MR. BILLINGSLEY. NO, YOU DON'T, BUT YOU WILL. COME IN. I WANT TO STRAIGHTEN YOU OUT, TOO. DON'T LOSE YOUR TEMPER! WHY NOT? WILTON, WHAT DO YOU THINK I AM, A CHUMP? NOT EXACTLY. THANKS. ARE YOU A CHUMP? NO, SIR. OH, YOU'RE SURE ABOUT YOURSELF. THAT'S RIGHT. BUT NOT OF ME, HUH? WELL, MR. BILLINGSLEY, MY EYES HAVE BEEN OPENED. HOW WOULD YOU LIKE SOMEBODY TO CLOSE THEM AGAIN? CAN'T WE SETTLE THIS LIKE GENTLEMEN? NOW YOU'RE TALKING MY LANGUAGE. I LIKE YOU, WILTON. I LIKE YOUR BAND, AND I LIKE JUDY. YES, SIR. DON'T SAY "YES, SIR" LIKE THAT. SORRY. COME HERE. LOOK AT THOSE PHOTOGRAPHS. TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT THEM. THOSE ARE THE ONLY WOMEN IN MY LIFE. THAT ONE'S PRETTY YOUNG, ISN'T SHE? THAT'S MY DAUGHTER. OH. THEY ALL ARE EXCEPT MY WIFE, AND I'M MARRIED TO HER. OH. I SEE. IT'S ABOUT TIME. WELL, I'M SORRY, MR. BILLINGSLEY. THAT LETTER SHOULD HAVE TIPPED YOU OFF. TOM CURTIS ISN'T MY LAWYER. TOM CURTIS? WHAT LETTER? OH, SHE DIDN'T SHOW YOU THE LETTER. NO. AND I WONDER WHY. WELL, FORGET I MENTIONED IT TO YOU. NOW I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF YOU TWO. KEEP YOUR PERSONAL AFFAIRS OUT OF THE STORK CLUB. THAT'S ALL. YES, SIR. WELL? MR. BILLINGSLEY, WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU WERE IN MY SPOT? I'D STOP BOTHERING ME. DANNY! WELL? WHAT HAPPENED? NOTHING MUCH. BILLINGSLEY'S OK. I WAS WRONG ABOUT YOU AND HIM. THERE. YOU SEE? NO, I DON'T. YOU DON'T? IT'S GOT TO BE SOMEBODY. OH, WELL, YOU KNOW WHO IT IS. I TOLD YOU. POP? CERTAINLY. OH, HOW COULD IT BE? WELL, HE'S A VERY RICH MAN AND A GOOD MAN. WAIT TILL YOU MEET HIS WIFE. HAVE YOU? NATURALLY. WHY DO YOU LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT, DANNY? WE'RE NEVER GONNA GET TOGETHER IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN ME. OH, JUDY, I WISH I COULD. OH, YOU'VE GOT TO, DANNY. IT'S THE ONLY WAY IT'LL WORK OUT. HI, JUDY. OH, HELLO, MR. CORETTI. HOW'S YOUR FRIEND POP, THE BUSBOY? OH. HA HA HA! OH, THAT WAS A VERY FUNNY GAG, WASN'T IT? YEAH. HE BREAKS $32 WORTH OF DISHES, AND SHE CALLS IT A GAG. WHO WAS HE? AN OLD MICK SHE BROUGHT AROUND. HE HAD A BROGUE THAT THICK. SOMEBODY OWES ME $32 FOR DISHES. OH, DANNY, I CAN EXPLAIN IT. SURE YOU CAN, BUT BREAK IT IN ON SOMEBODY ELSE. I WANT TO SPEAK WITH MR. CURTIS. HE'S NOT IN YET? WHY NOT? HE'S NOT AT HOME EITHER. NEVER MIND WHO IT IS. I'LL CALL AGAIN. HI, POP. WHAT GOES? I WAS CALLING YOUR LAWYER. MY LAWYER? THAT MAN CURTIS. I WAS TRYING ALL MORNING. BUT WHY? I THOUGHT HE MIGHT SPEAK TO DANNY ON YOUR BEHALF. WELL, THAT WOULDN'T DO ANY GOOD. IT MIGHT. I'LL GO TO ME ROOM AND BRUSH UP A BIT BEFORE I GO OUT. JEALOUSY IS A TERRIBLE THING. LOVE SHOULD BE TOLERANT TILL TRUTH BREAKS THROUGH THE CLOUDS OF DOUBT. GEE, THAT'S BEAUTIFUL, POP. WHO SAID THAT? I DID. [DOORBELL RINGS] I'M MRS. BATES, MRS. J.B. BATES. YES? ARE YOU JUDY PEABODY? THAT'S ME. [SOBBING] UH, COME IN, MRS. BATES. I KNOW NOW I'VE LOST HIM. WELL, I'LL BE GLAD TO HELP YOU LOOK FOR HIM. A FRIEND OF MINE IN THE BUILDING SAYS HE LIVES HERE. WELL, A LOT OF GUYS LIVE HERE. A LOT? HOW MANY? OH, 12 OR 14. YOU POOR CHILD. WELL, WHAT INSTRUMENT DOES HE PLAY? HE USED TO PLAY THE ZITHER. OH, HE'S NOT WITH THESE CATS. CATS? WHY DON'T YOU TRY THE SALVATION ARMY? I'M SURE MY HUSBAND WOULDN'T BE THERE. OH, OH, I'LL BET YOU MEAN POP! OH, HE LIVES HERE WITH ME. YOU ADMIT IT. OH, OH, NOW, MRS. BATES, THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH IT. YOUR HUSBAND WAS DROWNING, AND I SAVED HIS LIFE, AND I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET HIM A JOB. HE'S DOWN AND OUT. MR. BATES IS A RICH MAN. HOW'S THAT AGAIN? MR. BATES IS A VERY RICH MAN. OH! OH, THEN HE'S THE ONE. OH, IT'S TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE! MRS. BATES, YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE YOUR HUSBAND BACK. DON'T YOU WANT HIM? NO, AND HE DOESN'T WANT ME. WHY DIDN'T HE TELL ME WHO HE WAS? HE DID. THEN HE DENIED IT. I'M SORRY. I CAN'T FOLLOW THIS. NEITHER CAN I. HE'S PRACTICALLY RUINED MY LIFE. HOW? WELL, I GOT A BOYFRIEND. I MEAN, I HAD A BOYFRIEND. AND JERRY CUT HIM OUT? OH, NO. POP LOVES YOU. YOU'RE ALL HE EVER TALKS ABOUT. MISS PEABODY, I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. I WANT TO GO TO HIM. OH, NO, YOU DON'T. NOT ON YOUR LIFE. OUR MEN DON'T TRUST US. WE GOT TO TEACH THEM A LESSON. I TRIED THAT AND LOST HIM. WELL, THIS TIME, YOU DO IT MY WAY, AND YOU'LL GET HIM BACK. UM, BY THE WAY, DO YOU ALWAYS DRESS LIKE THAT? YES, I DO. WHY? YOU MEET ME IN THE PARIS SHOP AT LOCKE'S FIFTH AVENUE AT 2:00 THIS AFTERNOON. WE'RE GOING TO THE STORK CLUB TONIGHT. THE STORK CLUB? WHATEVER FOR? YOU LEAVE THAT TO ME. I CAN HARDLY CONTAIN MYSELF. OH, YOU'VE GOT TO! NOW WHEN POP COMES IN, MAKE BELIEVE YOU THINK THE WORST AND WALK OUT ON HIM! IS HE HERE NOW? CERTAINLY. TELL ME, MRS. BATES, IS YOUR SLATE CLEAN? MY SLATE CLEAN? YES. HE SEEMS TERRIBLY JEALOUS OF A MR. BASCOMBE. WELL, THAT'S RIDICULOUS. CLARENCE BASCOMBE IS A HARMLESS OLD BACHELOR. HE COURTED ME YEARS AGO, AND JERRY CAN'T STAND THE SIGHT OF HIM. HE'S COMING. NOW, WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T LET ON AND BE FIRM. JUDY, WHERE'D YOU PUT ME--OHH! WELL, MR. BATES, EXPLAIN YOURSELF. NOW, EDITH, TAKE IT EASY. ARE YOU GOING TO BELIEVE ME OR WHAT YOU SEE? WHO COULD BELIEVE YOU, YOU SCOUNDREL, YOU PHILANDERER, VIPER, YOU SNAKE IN THE GRASS? DON'T EVER SPEAK TO ME AGAIN! THIS IS THE END! [DOOR SHUTS] THE GODS HAVE DONE ME IN. THEY WERE LAYING FOR ME. I'VE LOST HER. WHO WAS THAT? ME WIFE. YOUR WIFE? COULDN'T YOU TELL? OH, WELL, RELAX, POP. REMEMBER, LOVE SHOULD BE TOLERANT TILL TRUTH BREAKS THROUGH THE CLOUDS OF DOUBT, AND IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHO SAID THAT, YOU DID. THE FACT IS, I READ THAT IN A VERY CHEAP BOOK. TSK, TSK, TSK.

OH, CHEER UP, POP. YOU'LL HAVE THE TIME OF YOUR LIFE. MR. CORETTI, DO YOU HAVE MY RESERVATIONS? WHAT? WHY, JUDY! YES, MISS PEABODY. THIS WAY, PLEASE. WHAT ARE YOU STARING AT? I NEVER FORGET A FACE. YOU'VE LOOKED AT MINE LONG ENOUGH TO REMEMBER IT THE NEXT TIME YOU SEE IT. YES, SIR. [PLAYING "I'M A SQUARE IN THE SOCIAL CIRCLE"] I JUST REMEMBERED! SHALL I PUT THE $32 FOR THE BROKEN DISHES ON YOUR BILL, SIR? YES, AND ADD $5.00 FOR YOURSELF AND FORGET YOU EVER SAW ME. IT WILL BE A PLEASURE, SIR. 'TIS MUTUAL.

I HEARD YOU WERE CAUGHT WITH YOUR SUSPENDERS DOWN. I'M A GONER. EDITH, I'M AN INNOCENT MAN, A VERY INNOCENT MAN. YES, JERRY, SO IT APPEARS. GOOD EVENING, YOUNG LADY. OH, MRS. BATES, I HOPE YOU DON'T BLAME ME. NOT AT ALL, MY DEAR. IF IT WASN'T YOU, IT WOULD BE SOMEBODY ELSE. NO, IT WOULDN'T. AH. A LOVE MATCH. I THINK I'LL SKIP THE NEXT ROUND OF THIS BATTLE. WILL YOU EXCUSE ME, PLEASE? GOOD RIDDANCE. AT LEAST SHE'LL TALK TO YOU. SHE WON'T LISTEN TO ME. YOU'VE GOT TO GET ME OUT OF THIS. HOW? TELL HER THE FACTS. SHE WON'T BELIEVE THE FACTS ANY MORE THAN DANNY DOES. YOU CAN TRY. OK. YOU WERE GREAT. YOU'VE GOT HIM ON THE HOOK. HE'S REALLY SQUIRMING. I DON'T THINK I'LL BE ABLE TO GO THROUGH WITH THIS, JUDY. YOU'VE GOT TO. IF YOU NAIL HIM DOWN RIGHT THIS TIME, HE'S YOURS FOR LIFE. SHE SAYS SHE'S GOING TO DIVORCE YOU AND MARRY SOMEBODY WHO APPRECIATES HER. SHE CAN'T. I'LL FIGHT IT. I'LL TAKE IT TO THE SUPREME COURT. TELL HER THAT. YOU'RE OUT IN FRONT BY 20 LENGTHS. DON'T CARRY IT TOO FAR. LEAVE IT TO ME. WELL? I THINK YOU GOT A CHANCE. WE HAVE? IT'S GONNA BE TOUGH, THOUGH. I DON'T DESERVE HER. FIRST YOU GOT TO PROMISE TO COUNT TO 10 BEFORE LOSING YOUR TEMPER. I'VE ALWAYS DONE THAT! YEAH? WELL, MAKE IT 20. ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. NEXT, YOU CAN NEVER TAKE YOUR SHOES OFF IN THE LIVING ROOM. A MAN CAN'T LIVE UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS. WILL YOU OR WON'T YOU? ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. AND-- AW, THERE'S MORE! YOU MUST PROMISE NEVER UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES TO BE JEALOUS OF CLARENCE BASCOMBE. BASCOMBE? AH, I SEE IT ALL NOW. SHE'D TIE ME HANDS BEHIND ME BACK FOR THE REST OF ME LIFE, WOULD SHE? OH, NO! NOT IF I KNOW HER, SHE WON'T. OH, IT'S VERY SLICK OF YOU, VERY SLICK OF YOU INDEED, MRS. BATES. YOU AND YOUR STIPULATIONS, AND ME AGREEING TO THEM. NOW, CALM YOURSELF, POP. NO, NO, JUDY. THIS GOES DEEPER THAN YOUR INNOCENT EYES CAN SEE. BUT, JERRY-- DON'T JERRY ME! YOU'RE NOT GOING TO PULL THE WOOL OVER ME EYES AS YOU DID IN THE PAST. THAT ISN'T TRUE! AND I'M GOING OUT OF HERE. NO, YOU'RE NOT, NOT TILL YOU PAY THE CHECK. THEY'RE VERY FUNNY ABOUT THAT IN HERE. SOMEBODY BRING ME THE CHECK. IF YOU LEAVE HERE, JERRY BATES, YOU'LL NEVER SEE ME AGAIN. THAT'S WHAT I HAD IN MIND. I'M ASHAMED OF YOU, POP. WELL, I-- SLIP THIS TO DANNY, WILL YOU? THAT OUGHT TO GET HIM. BRING ME THE CHECK. I'M NOT GONNA WAIT HERE ANY LONGER. POP, ARE YOU REALLY LEAVING? OF COURSE I AM. YOU'LL BE SORRY SOMEDAY. WELL, IF I AM, I'LL BE GLAD OF IT. THIS IS FROM ONE OF YOUR FANS. THANKS. HEY, FELLAS, THE BOSS WANTS TO HEAR "OLD APPLE TREE." WE'LL FAKE IT IN "G" RIGHT AFTER THIS CHORUS. AND IT WAS A LOT DIFFERENT, TOO, WASN'T IT, POP? OH, I KNOW YOU HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN, EVEN THOUGH IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO-- 40 YEARS. YOU TOLD ME ABOUT IT YOURSELF. IT BROUGHT TEARS TO YOUR EYES WHEN YOU DID. LOOK AT HER, POP. ISN'T SHE BEAUTIFUL? JUST THINK WHAT SHE WAS THEN. WHY, EVERY BOY ON THE BLOCK HOPED SHE'D LOOK HIS WAY, BUT SHE ONLY HAD EYES FOR ONE, A YOUNG, WILD IRISHMAN. HE HAD A RIGHT TO BE JEALOUS. IT WAS SWEET TILL IT GOT STUPID. IN 1905, HE WAS ROMANTIC, WHERE THEY DANCED TO THE SAME SONG THEY'RE PLAYING NOW, BUT I GUESS THAT'S THE TROUBLE. HE JUST ISN'T ROMANTIC ANYMORE. OH, BUT HE IS. EDITH, WILL YOU DANCE WITH ME ONCE AGAIN TO THE TUNE OF OUR SONG? I'D BE PLEASED TO, JERRY, IF-- I KNOW IT. I'LL SAY I'M SORRY. WELL, I AM, AND IT COMES FROM THE BOTTOM OF ME HEART. WELL, I'M GLAD THAT'S PATCHED UP. YES. ISN'T IT WONDERFUL? CORETTI, IS THAT A WALTZ? YOU'VE BEEN IN VIENNA. IS IT? I'M HERE AT STORK CLUB SO LONG, I CAN'T REMEMBER. NO. IT COULDN'T BE A WALTZ. THEY WOULDN'T DARE. NO, SIR. THAT'S A WALTZ, ISN'T IT? YES, SIR. WHAT'S THE I-- WELL, THERE'S NOTHING LIKE A GOOD OLD-FASHIONED WALTZ. BY THE WAY, TOM CURTIS, THAT FELLA WE WERE DISCUSSING, IS AT THE TABLE NEXT TO JUDY'S. WOULD YOU LIKE TO MEET HIM? NO, THANKS. HERE, TOM. TAKE OVER. DO ME A FAVOR, WILL YOU, GWEN? SURE. WHAT? GO AND TELL THAT GUY CURTIS HE'S WANTED ON THE PHONE IN THE FIRST BOOTH. OK, DANNY. MR. CURTIS, YOU'RE WANTED ON THE TELEPHONE IN THE FIRST BOOTH. THANK YOU. WILL YOU EXCUSE ME? YES. OH, I'M SORRY. THAT'S ALL RIGHT. COME IN. MR. CURTIS, I'M DANNY WILTON. HOW DO YOU DO? IT'S RATHER CLOSE IN HERE, ISN'T IT? I LIKE IT THAT WAY. WELL, IT'S MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE OUT AT THE BAR. UH-HUH, BUT BILLINGSLEY'S GOT A RULE-- ANYONE WHO FIGHTS IN THE STORK CLUB IS BARRED FOR LIFE. I KIND OF WISH I'D BEEN BARRED YESTERDAY. LOOK, MR. CURTIS. SOME TIME AGO, I WAS IN A CAVE ABOUT THIS SIZE WITH A JAP. AS YOU CAN GATHER, I'M HERE TO TELL THE TALE. UH, AHEM. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE JAP? UNH! I KNOW I'M SUPPOSED TO DOUBLE OVER AT THIS POINT, BUT THERE REALLY ISN'T ROOM. LISTEN, CURTIS. THERE'S ONLY ONE THING I WANT FROM YOU. WELL, I HOPE I'VE GOT IT. I WANT THE TRUTH ABOUT THAT LETTER YOU WROTE TO JUDY PEABODY AND EVERYTHING THAT'S BEHIND IT. OH, IS THAT ALL? THAT'S VERY SIMPLE. MISS PEABODY SAVED MR. BATES FROM DROWNING. HE WANTED TO REWARD HER AND STILL REMAIN ANONYMOUS. IT'S ALL VERY INNOCENT, I ASSURE YOU. OH. WELL, THANKS, MR. CURTIS. THAT'S GREAT. SAY, CAN I BUY YOU A DRINK? YES, YOU CAN UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE SUED WITHIN AN INCH OF YOUR LIFE. BUT, JUDY DEAR, YOU'VE GIVEN ALL YOUR TIME TO US. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT YOUR YOUNG MAN? I'M JUST GOING TO TELL HIM THE TRUTH. JUDY, YOU CAN'T DO THAT. YOU'VE ALREADY TOLD HIM THE TRUTH, AND HE DOESN'T BELIEVE IT. POP, WHAT CAN I DO? TELL HIM ANOTHER LIE. WHAT LIE? I HAVEN'T WORKED ANYTHING OUT. I'VE SEE YOU AT WORK, AND I HAVE EVERY CONFIDENCE IN YOUR ABILITY. ALL RIGHT, BUT YOU'VE GOT TO BACK ME UP. WE'LL DO THAT IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE. WHILE EDITH AND I WERE DANCING, WE TALKED ABOUT A LITTLE SURPRISE FOR YOU. OH, DANNY. YOU KNOW MR. AND MRS. BATES. HOW DO YOU DO? DANNY, I HAVE TO SING WITH THE BAND, OR MR. BILLINGSLEY'S GOING TO LET US ALL GO. THAT'S HIS PRIVILEGE. I WON'T TILL YOU BELIEVE IN ME, AND I KNOW YOU WON'T LET ME TILL YOU KNOW THE TRUTH. THAT'S RIGHT. WELL, DANNY, YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR IT RIGHT NOW. I'M LISTENING. IT--IT STARTED MANY, MANY YEARS AGO IN 1849, WASN'T IT, POP? YEAH. YEAH. '49. THAT'S RIGHT. IN THE SUMMER. IT WAS THE YEAR OF THE GOLD RUSH. YEAH, I SAW THE PICTURE. HOW'D YOU LIKE CHARLIE IN IT? STICK TO THE SUBJECT. WELL, YOU SEE, IT STARTED THE DAY I SAVED POP FROM DROWNING. THAT'S WHEN HE FIRST DISCOVERED WHO I WAS. I HAVE A STRAWBERRY MARK ON MY LEFT THIGH, AND MY BATHING SUIT DOESN'T COVER IT. POP NOTICED IT. YOU'LL SEE IT SOMEDAY. WELL, POP CASUALLY MENTIONED THAT HIS FATHER KNEW A MAN IN ALASKA WITH THE VERY SAME MARKING. THEY SHARED A CLAIM IN THE BIG YELLOW TAIL MINE. INTERESTING? VERY. VERY. I MEAN, THE WAY JUDY TELLS IT. I KNOW THE STORY WELL, BUT I NEVER GET TIRED OF HEARING HER RELATE IT. GO AHEAD, JUDY. THANKS. WELL, RIGHT ABOUT HERE, I THINK I OUGHT TO MENTION MY GRANDFATHER'S MAP. OH, A VERY GOOD-LOOKING MAN HE WAS, TOO. THE MAP WITH A MINE. YES, YES. PARDON THE INTRUSION. WELL, MY GRANDFATHER WAS LOST IN THE BLIZZARD OF '51, AND POP AND HIS FATHER HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR ME EVERY SINCE. POP CHANGED HIS NAME TO BUTLER WHILE SEARCHING FOR ME. WELL, OF COURSE NOW YOU'RE VERY RICH. NO. AND THIS IS THE PART YOU WON'T BELIEVE. THE MAN THAT POP'S FATHER THOUGHT WAS MY GRANDFATHER TURNED OUT TO BE NO RELATION OF MINE AT ALL. WELL, HOW DID YOU FIND THAT OUT? MY GRANDMOTHER TOLD ME! WELL, NOW THAT MAKES SENSE. WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME THAT IN THE FIRST PLACE? I DIDN'T THINK YOU'D BELIEVE IT. OH, JUDY, YOU UNDERESTIMATE ME. YOU SEE, I DO BELIEVE IN YOU. NOW DOESN'T THAT MAKE YOU ELIGIBLE TO SING WITH THE BAND? HURRY BACK. YOU HAVEN'T HEARD THE SURPRISE. ♪ IF I HAD A DOZEN HEARTS ♪ ♪ AND IF YOU HAD ONLY ONE ♪ WHAT A LIAR. ♪ IF I HAD A DOZEN HEARTS ♪ ♪ I WOULD LOVE YOU 12 TIMES ONE ♪ YELLOWTAIL MINE. ♪ IF I HAD A DOZEN LIPS ♪ ♪ I WOULD SAY ♪ GRANDFATHER'S MAP. ♪ 12 TIMES A DAY ♪ STRAWBERRY MARK. ♪ DARLING, I LOVE YOU ♪ WELL, SEEING IS BELIEVING. ♪ IF I HAD A DOZEN ARMS ♪ ♪ THEY WOULD ALL BE HOLDING YOU ♪ BUT I FORGIVE YOU. ♪ IF I HAD A DOZEN DREAMS ♪ ♪ IN YOUR ARMS, THEY WOULD ALL COME TRUE ♪ KNOW WHY? ♪ ALTHOUGH ♪ BECAUSE I LOVE YOU. ♪ I KNOW ♪ ♪ A DOZEN HEARTS ARE FUN ♪ ♪ I COULDN'T LOVE YOU ♪ ♪ MUCH MORE THAN I DO WITH ONE ♪ [APPLAUSE] I LOVE YOU, PIE FACE.

I CAN'T REPAY YOU, BUT I HAVE AN IDEA. I'VE DISCUSSED IT WITH EDITH, AND WE HOPE YOU'LL BE PLEASED THAT I'M GOING TO MENTION YOU IN MY WILL. OH, NO, THAT'S OUT, POP. NOT THAT I DON'T APPRECIATE THE THOUGHT AND ALL, BUT, OH, I DON'T KNOW, I DON'T SEEM TO BE ABLE TO GET ALONG WITH MONEY. MY HAPPINESS WILL COME WITH DANNY, SINGING WITH THE BAND ON THOSE ONE-NIGHT STANDS. BAD HOTELS, BAD FOOD, BUT WE'LL BE TOGETHER. WE'LL BE RIDING ON CLOUD 9 JUST OUTSIDE OF HEAVEN. I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN, AND I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT. TWO YOUNG KIDS IN LOVE MIGHT GET ALL MIXED UP WITH A MILLION IN THE BANK. A MILLION?! KEEP TALKING, POP. MAYBE YOU CAN CHANGE MY MIND.
