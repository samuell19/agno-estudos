How did you feel as a boy who fled from Germany and a part of your family must have suffered, to play the role of a German officer and later you even played the role of a... Nazi. A Nazi with a dubious past. Look, when you must take on the identity of another man, for many years, and to live with this identity all day long, you either become the other person in your thoughts and in your dreams and if you're incapable of that, then you're not suitable for the role. You have a son... -Yes. He's studying in the United States now. Did he inherit any of your adventurousness? -Yes, a little. | remember the first time we arrived in Paris. | remember it well. It was May 23rd, 1961. My Mom was anxious during the flight. We landed and she saw Dad was waiting for us, that everything's fine and it's all going according to plan. Then she relaxed. Then we drove to the city. | was mesmerized. All the lights, Paris... | wasn't even 12 years old yet. When we arrived we were supposed to stay for five years. All I knew then was that my Dad was sent over by the Defense Ministry and we'd be stationed in Paris and Dad would go on long business trips. In the 1960's, all the buildings in Israel were new. So the first thing I said when we came in was: "What an old place!" The floors were made of wood. When you walked you heard it creaking. As if the house was speaking to you. Saying hello. We were a family and everything was really nice. We went on a lot of trips and had a lot of fun. We made the best of the time we had together. It was important to us all. When he went on his first trip | was told it would be for 4 months. It seemed like a long time. When you're 12 years old, 4 months is 5 percent of your entire life. It's a lot. The last thing that should happen is that the family becomes aware of the job at hand and the mission. He should tell his family there's a business opportunity which will better their financial situation. The job involves traveling and visiting many clients abroad. Any story to reassure the family and not leave any room for worry. A pilot who enters enemy territory and perhaps shoots a plane down returns full of pride. He tells all the guys about it. Perhaps he even gets a medal. In our case, when you return, you have to keep your mouth shut. You have to stay anonymous and choke on what you did. He was the kind of man who could look the angel of Death in the eyes, never lower his gaze, invite him to a drink and raise a glass to him. He had nerves of steel. You can be very proud of your Dad. He was an extraordinary man. Cairo 1961 In those days, Egypt was our biggest enemy. We estimated they had high military capabilities. Egypt's citizens and visitors had limited freedom. This made Lotz decide not to go to Egypt. Later his decision was changed. If he was afraid, and he was, he overcame his fears. He was an adventurer. But you can't go on such a mission if you aren't adventurous. At the time, Nasser wanted to obtain weapons of mass destruction. We discovered he wanted to make chemical weapons to threaten Israel and perhaps at some point even use it. Who was involved in that market at the time? The Germans, right after the war. Professor Pilz, where did you work before going to Egypt? My colleagues and |, and their parents who were here, came from Peenemunde. From a moral perspective, German scientists, after what happened in the past, are helping a country who's president talks about attacking Israel. | want to add that we aren't acting here against Israel. We are only helping with development. It was also a question of money. | got paid very well. Because after the Second World War they lost their jobs in Germany. There was no possibility. So German government was of course not happy about this fact, but there were no legal means to prevent it. The German scientists and experts were very well watched by the Egyptian intelligence. And they had to have thousands of people working for them. Simple people. Taxi drivers. The community avoided keeping close contacts with the experts. It was considered too dangerous. A cover story is good when it involves few lies. Lotz was born in Germany and had a German passport. He knew the German language as well as any German. He told me he wasn't circumcised. We added some false details. For instance, that he was a SS officer who fled from Germany because of Nazi hunting. All of this enabled him to socialize with the scientists. We knew he was a daring man. Lotz had the ability to make connections with the right people. He easily fit into the cover story of being a former Nazi. We told him to develop a horse breeding farm in Egypt, use it as a place of social gatherings and pass the information on to us. | didn't think he was going to Egypt. | was sure he was operating in Europe. After 3 or 4 months, | began the countdown. When is Dad coming back? He'll be here soon. | was eager for his return. Most of the kids at school were children of government workers from the Defense Ministry or the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. We all knew our parents were doing important things. They were all on missions for the state. That gave it a sense of importance. At the time, half of the people in Paris were from the Mossad. It was the Mossad's European headquarters. Missions to hunt down Nazis or operations in Arab countries all originated there. Children of our generation knew not to discuss what they saw. Usually they told us something and we understood we had to ignore it. We knew it was a matter of national security. And that's that. Cairo 1962 Lotz lived there as a man without financial difficulties. He was a member of many clubs: horse riding clubs and country clubs. There were enough social venues for him to meet anyone. He had contacts in the Egyptian military and police forces. He made his contacts with local government and military officials through the horses. Horse riding and races were an important asset in the so called Egyptian high society. He knew how to make people talk and to get information from them. My life centered around the Gezira horse club, where I worked with my horses. Usually, people who ride horses become one big family. As soon as he came he was adopted into the family. He listened a lot. | noticed that about him. Sometimes when the men were having conversations | don't know what they talked about, but he liked to join and listen. Once he convinced himself he was the character which he was playing, he stopped playing it. He was just living it. Just like a good actor doesn't play his role, but rather he lives his role. | believe he never thought that there would be someone inside the Egyptian circle, where he was living, who could expose him, except for himself. And he was sure of himself. Every few months he'd go for meetings in Europe to report to his superiors and to charge his batteries, meet with his family and so on. We'd meet at a prearranged and set place. We'd exchange all his documents and he'd return to his original identity. After we parted he'd take a cab or the metro back home to his family. We always knew when he was coming. We'd wait. The doorbell would ring or I'd go downstairs when I saw the cab drive up through the window. Dad would arrive and everything would turn upside down. Everything would change. Our whole world would change. One Saturday morning we sat in a caf√©, with Jacob Nahmias. The three of us sat at the table and they spoke with one another. | sat and listened. As soon as they started talking about Egypt, and talked about details involving an Egyptian general and "I rented a house there..." all kinds of such details. | immediately understood what was going on. | don't know if they just blurted it out, or if they planned to let me in on the secret that day, but when we left here, they parted and I returned with Dad. He said: "Now you know what I'm doing. Now you understand." Something like that. And I replied: "Yes." He said: "You understand you must keep quiet "because my life depends on it." | said: "Yes, of course." It felt important. It didn't weigh down on me. | felt part of a secret organization. It was a secret. It was important. It was a matter of national security. And I understood his life depended on it. | never told anyone. It was an exceptional case in which the family was so aware of what the husband was doing. It doesn't make it easier on the family, and certainly not on the... on the person. On the agent. He would have felt more comfortable if he knew they didn't know and they weren't worried. Their concern becomes his own worry. He used to tell all kinds of stories from Egypt. | had an 8 mm film projector. He'd show us the film of Egypt before he passed it on to the Office. He never told us anything about being nervous or afraid or... He was always in total control. He'd pick me up from school, we'd go eat together and go to a movie. I remember we went to see James Bond once, "From Russia with Love". He laughed and told me it's much more interesting in real life. | always saw the equipment he took with him on the trip. His radio or his new transmitter which he practiced using here. Someone came especially from Israel to train him with the new transmitter. They'd sit here and he'd click away. | asked him if he was ever scared. He told me in his profession you can't be scared. You can't be afraid because he said once he leaves here he stops being Ze'ev Gur Arie and becomes Wolfgang Lotz. His departures were always quick and to the point. There was no lingering or stalling or anything like that. I'd walk him downstairs, we'd hug and kiss. He'd get in the cab and go. | remember I'd say goodbye and I was sad. | was sad... The sadness of a boy who's father is leaving. Cairo 1963 Lotz gathered information and categorized every German scientist there. There were important messages or answers to questions which he transmitted. Israel 1963 The Israeli public knew about Egypt's nuclear development program and that the Germans were helping them and "wanted to destroy Israel". I'd say there were some very exaggerated headlines. "Egypt's Death Rockets What are German experts doing in Cairo?" "German Scientists in Egypt Develop Weapons of Mass Destruction‚Äù There was much panic. From a certain date onwards, Lotz's became more active in dealing with the scientists. He changed from being a... A watchman to a sharpshooter. There were threat letters: "If you don't leave Egypt, this and that could happen.‚Äù The German scientists and experts asked us to protect them but we of course did not know who was the sender of these letters. Some came from outside, others from inside Cairo. So they felt themselves threatened. Uneasy. Not only uneasy, but threatened. They worried about their security. The secretary of Professor Pilz, who was competent for the missile program, received a letter with explosives. She became nearly blind. | first read the thin letters. The thick letter left there was sent by a Dr. Hanke from Hamburg. It was odd. The letter was addressed to Professor Pilz. The blast broke my thigh bone and I can't see well either. There were 4 or 5 envelopes which exploded there and I remember reading about it in the papers and knowing exactly what was going on, who sent them and how they arrived. By that time I was... I think I was 14 years old. I was older. | was proud to be in on the secret. | knew what was going on. Wolf was sent on three different missions which were conflicting and that was wrong. One was to create a base, another was to gather information, and a third was to arrange bombings. Those three things can't be mixed. If you're sending letter bombs, you're going to Cairo, mailing letter bombs and then taking the next plane to Italy. But if you're just sitting there someone can catch you. How can you leave him there? There's a good chance someone will get to him. Why not? Maybe someone saw him drop the letters in the mailbox. I don't know. Paris 1964 The boss asked me to take care of the family. Rivka and Udi. He said it's one of the duties of his agents' wives. She asked to meet with him, with the boss, but he avoided meeting the wives of his agents. She shared her concerns with me. She was worried. Certainly worried. She was afraid, but she was a patriot. So it was flattering for her that he was so successful and had found his place. At least for the meantime. It was a one way relationship. We couldn't make contact with him, but he'd send us letters once a month. We'd get a letter from him. He'd change his handwriting. He didn't send it in his own name or to our own names either. | remember a few times he gave me a German name, Uli. There were lots of things | wanted to share with him. A report card from school or a sporting success or something. But I knew I couldn't and that's that. Cairo 1964 His confidence grew with every trip and he felt this was his stage. His fictitious identity wasn't so fictitious. The lifestyle he led in Egypt was a lifestyle which he enjoyed, which he wanted, which he desired. He mingled in society, he enjoyed life and liked the good life with all its manners, the champagne, the cigars and the beautiful women. The dancing and the music. The job was made for him. | think he thought he was best at that game, that he did it best and he was born for it. Espionage isn't a profession. It's an art form. Wolf was an artist, without a doubt. He could have been a good stage actor. But the danger is not to overdo it. Not to stick out in his surroundings. He lacked that quality. He needed the self restraint which would give him an objective perspective of what was allowed and what was forbidden. | think that boundary became blurred. Paris 1965 Rivka always said it was dangerous. She hoped it would end well. She told me: "I had a terrible nightmare." She told me she dreamt he was caught. It was very vivid. She felt terrible. I'm sure she was scared and afraid, but she never let me feel it. As far as I was concerned it all looked pretty safe. Mom used to read the Herald Tribune every day. She'd send me out to get the paper. Thank you. | looked at the headline and read the bottom. | turned it over and it jumped up at me: "Wolfgang Lotz". And his wife, Waltraud Lotz..." | remember the blood rushed down to my feet. After a few seconds of shock, | immediately thought: "Wow. What do I tell Mom?" It was like... They had disappeared and | understood they'd been arrested. | knew what "disappeared" meant. And also, who is this Waltraud? This was a very big love. A very big love. A very big love. She called me and she told me she met a man on the train that she likes very much. A horse breeder from Australia. And he's looking for horses. I don't know, for making some breeding. And she was very interested in him and she fell in love the first moment, she told me. They talked on the train and the attraction must have been very tense. Very intense on both sides. On both sides. And they right away left together. She told me the first night every woman would dream of having such a first night with their lover. With champagne in the bathtub. There was no champagne, but still... And him drinking the champagne out from the shoe. It was something outstanding. When she came back she said that's the man of her life and that they will stay together. Well, when she came with the real story, that he wants to go not back to Australia for the horse breeding, that he wants to do this in Egypt, | was very much afraid. | was very afraid. | was very afraid. | think at the time, we didn't know all the details about their matching. | knew he was living with a German lady. I think I knew. It became clear from the material he passed on to the office. There was an envelope which was addressed to "Mr. and Mrs. Lotz." The fact he hid his relationship with Waltraud was out of the ordinary and not customary. It was out of line and in bad taste. The unit commander came and had a heart to heart talk with him. He admitted her existence. He tried to convince the unit commander it was good for his cover and good for his mission. That it was a good thing. There was a lot of deliberation. They checked and examined the facts and the unit commander decided to continue the mission. | think after 3 or 4 months | went there to look. | didn't have such a good feeling. | thought I will discover something but all I discovered was a dream like in a movie story or something. It started in the morning. Breakfast, into the riding boots, go to the Gezira sporting club, staying there all day. After a few months she really sat very well in the saddle. Wolfgang taught her. And then I also got a lesson from him and he was a very strict teacher. Even cruel. Even cruel. One day I was crying. I said: "I can't anymore. "You don't see my blisters. And there and here and blue..." And then Teddy showed me in the evening. She said: "Look." It was healing. But one day she must have been all open. She told me: "If I want to stay with this man I have to sit on a horse and I have to sit good. And she did every day. Every day for hours. | felt terrible about it. | couldn't tell her. | couldn't talk to her about it. | was very friendly with Rivka and it seemed terrible to me. The whole story was terrible. Today perhaps my viewpoint has changed, but at the time it seemed a betrayal of all that is holy. A betrayal of a wife, of the family. And at first I thought maybe it was good for him and for his role, perhaps it served him well to have a wife. And that she so identifies with what he's doing. She thought he was working for NATO. At first, she had no idea. She understood she had to help him. She'd host the German scientists and the Egyptian government officials. They had lots of parties. It served the mission very well. She would look outside when he sent transmissions from the bedroom. She made sure the neighbors wouldn't surprise them. She joined him on trips around Egypt, where they were allowed to go, and she knew she was serving as his "camouflage‚Äù. It helped him. | said: "He'll break up with her later.‚Äù No, but if you'd bring him back to Israel because of something like that you'd be losing an asset. | think it's a cardinal mistake to let a person live a real double life. For real. Because he wasn't acting. It was a real woman who he loved. He legally married her. The Mossad is responsible for that complication. They organized it, they agreed to it. Maybe they didn't organize it, but they agreed to it after the fact. He wasn't sent home. Nothing was done. Nothing. They left one as his wife and the other as his wife and only they knew. What sort of thing is that? It gave him a split personality. He'd come to Paris, be a family man. And later he'd go back to Cairo to be another family man. You're not lying to the Egyptians. You're lying to Rivka and to Udi... When he came he was expected to spend more time together as a family. Usually he'd run off to meetings and actually, from what I saw, he wanted to leave as soon as possible. He said on one occasion: "Tell them I need to go." Six of them were arrested. There was Dad, Waltraud whom I didn't know about, and I think her parents, and Franz Kiesow and his wife and I think that's it. | remember I walked slowly. | tried to think and saw there was no way out. | went home, walked inside and I remember I told my Mom: "Look, Dad's disappeared." Or something like that. She took the paper and... She was in shock, too. Then a whole mess began. Within minutes people started calling. I don't know. There were calls from the Office. Apparently everyone ran and bought the Herald Tribune. The state of mind was: "Now they're trying to find out information." And I had the imagination of a 15 year old. | was sure they had lots of agents in Egypt checking it out. And... Finding out exactly what happened. The critical matter was information. What's happening? And no one knew. They didn't know. They didn't know anything. Then my faith in the system was shaken because I was surprised they didn't know and he'd been caught. So | understood we were in trouble. Then I was worried. | was scared. | felt fear. It was clear... If an Israeli spy was caught in Egypt. It was the end of the road. Whenever I talked to Dad he'd always say: "If they catch me..." Suddenly all these people came to our house. They caught us and said: "Don't move." We didn't know where the prison was because we were blindfolded. We arrived at the prison. We were separated and interrogated separately. They blindfolded our eyes, put us in a high chair so our legs didn't touch the floor and we couldn't move anything. They asked us questions under a very bright light. We asked: "What's going on here?" They said: "You were arrested because you are friends of Lotz and his wife. They are spies." "Decision to trial German terror organization" According to publications in Egypt, he had a servant at home. The servant reported his behavior for some reason. When they surrounded his house and went inside, the servant took them straight to the bathroom. In the bathroom there was a scale and inside the scale was a transmitter. They knew we were innocent, but didn't want to admit it. In the papers it said: "We arrested a ring of spies." There were only two spies. Lotz and his wife. They needed others to create the "ring" and we were the ring. | think they knew we didn't belong to the same group as poor Lotz. The enemy we face doesn't use brains. There they use the strong hand, torture and suffering. The torture is horrible. Not everybody can withstand it. Sooner or later, most people are forced to talk. Waltraud was tortured more than Wolf... They filled her with water and then stomped over her. She did everything for him and everything she could to save him. Nowhere did it say he was an Israeli. Everyone saw that and understood they had to be very careful because the Egyptians didn't know he was Israeli and we had to keep this terrible secret. His cover was totally perfect. | went to Germany to talk to Gehlen who was head of the German secret service. | told him there was such and such a man who has taken on a Nazi identity. | told him: Take him under your wing. He immediately agreed. This gave Lotz a sense of security. He was interviewed on TV and on the radio. How do you do, sir? Sit please. -Thank you. Would you please tell me about your life history before contacting the Israeli organization. Secret organization. Yes. Well there's not much to tell about my life history. | was born and raised in Berlin. | went to school there. | was born in 1921. In 1960 in Berlin, | casually met one or two Israelis. And they explained to me that they would invite me to make trips to Egypt. There was good money in it. There was very little to do. | wasn't hurting anybody. | wasn't harming anybody. Just a little information to pick up, which |, as a German tourist, can easily do. All information pointed to the fact they still didn't suspect him of being Israeli. He was still acting as a German. In Israel there were TV sets which could receive Arab broadcasts. We feared someone would see his face and recognize him as an Israeli. We scrambled the reception in Israel. His acting ability was really put to the test. If he's a Jewish Israeli agent who was spying for Israel, he'd end up like Eli Cohen. Eli Cohen was caught in Syria and it had a great impact on our unit. It was one blow after another. Once they knew he'd been arrested and that it would be a big problem, they started talking about us returning to Israel. Mom packed a suitcase, | packed a suitcase... The next day we flew back to Israel. As a kid I asked myself: "What now?" "Where will I go to school? Where will we live? "Who will my friends be?" All the self confidence I'd had came from the confidence which my Dad projected. ‚ÄúIt's fine. I'm in control.‚Äù Suddenly the bubble burst. Tel Aviv 1965 | wasn't worried about the move and the change of school. A new place. That didn't bother me so much. The toughest part was the anxiety. | went to the Gymnasia Herzeliya School and we had a field trip. An annual field trip or something like that. We went to the Galilee and on the way back the buses stopped in the town of Afula. We got off to buy a drink at the kiosk and I saw the daily paper with headlines about Eli Cohen being executed in Damascus "Eli Cohen was Hung in Damascus" | remember that... | couldn't talk about it with anyone. And it really hurt in my heart. So I just kept it inside and went on. | had no one to share it with. | didn't have any way to release the pressure and my worries. Nothing. | started talking about it with my Mom, but she... She had a full plate of her own. | didn't want to burden her with my worries. So I tried not to talk to her about it. The office... To be honest, | didn't interest them too much. They didn't think a 15 year old boy needed any psychological support or social support or I don't know what. The whole trial was very secret. If anything came out and they discovered he was Israeli, he'd die and all that responsibility was on my shoulders. Not to say anything. Friends would ask me: "What does your Dad do? Where is he? "What is he?" I'd tell them all kinds of lies. He's in Europe on business. On a mission. Working. Looking back it seems insane. And of course we waited for the sentencing. We waited in suspense. | remember I didn't feel happy, but I felt relieved. It was a relief. It was a relief. A relief of tension. The trial was incredible. We left there and were happy to leave. All we wanted was to leave. | never returned to Egypt. I'm not so angry at Lotz. I'm angry at the injustice we suffered. After the sentence, Lotz and his wife were transferred to the Tura Prison. The conditions were worse in comparison with the prison, the Barage Prison. One time I met Dad's boss, Yos'ke Yariv. He mainly wanted to report that they're doing everything possible to make Dad comfortable and hope one day he'll be released. | knew there was a problem with Waltraud and didn't know how it'd be solved. It was an important issue. I'm sure he knew it was very important to Mom and me. Now it's not something I brought up and he didn't bring it up either. Of course they concealed things from us. They concealed many things. During his years in prison there was an article or two in the German press and there were photos of him in prison. | remember the Mossad brought us the photos. You see him with a cigarette, showing his transmitter. He looks... To me, as someone who knew him, he looks very stressed. | remember it hurt very much to see that photograph. | felt so sorry for him. You imagine all sorts of possibilities. What's it like in prison, what do people do there, what if it's cold in winter? If they yell at them and hit them and... You try to imagine what it's like in prison. During the Six Day War | remember I was very worried. That he'd be killed or abused. The Egyptians took a beating in that war. They could have easily taken out their anger on him. Once the war was over and we had 5,000 Egyptian captives with 9 generals among them, my worries were eased a bit because it was clear there would be an exchange. And then the Egyptians answered "No." Nasser said no. He won't do it. Nasser said he wouldn't exchange POW's for spies. That's what he said. | gathered all our Arab experts to get their advice. They all said it was an issue of ‚Äúsharaf". Of pride. And the families of Israeli captives, there were a few pilots and some naval commandos and their families began putting pressure. They said: "Forget it. Leave the spies. Bring back our sons." December 25th, 1967. "Dear Prime Minister, Mr. Levi Eshkol, | am writing you this as the son of Ze'ev Gur Arie, a Major in the IDF, {Wolfgang Lotz). For nearly three years we've waited for my father's return. Our hopes grew following the Six Day War when the IDF captured many Egyptian troops. My father, who risked his life for years and was eventually arrested, has a part in the war's success. And if the IDF has so many captives, | believe we must insist that when those captives are exchanged, my father will also be returned. Even if it means waiting a bit longer. I'm asking you Mr. Prime Minister to do all that is in your power so that I may see my father again. Respectfully yours with thanks, Oded Gur Arie." Two weeks later I received an answer. "Dear sir. The Prime Minister read your letter of December 25th, 1967 and asked me to confirm its receipt. Sincerely, Y. Lior. Military Secretary to the Prime Minister." It's an embarrassing answer, isn't it? Moshe Dayan said: I don't want to keep 6,000 prisoners "during the winter." I'm going to exchange them. | said: "Moshe, over my dead body." We sent a letter to Nasser. We wrote: "We have a proposal. "We'll release all your prisoners. When we finish releasing them, we want you to release our people and we promise not to publicize it." Suddenly a message came to the Foreign Ministry: "I agree." We started releasing them and believe me the toughest time of my life was when we released them. It took us about a week. Every day we released 1,000 men until we were left with "no chickens in the coup." Then I waited for him to fill his side of the agreement. | remember I was worried. We waited in suspense. | remember when I found out the Egyptians gave in and they'd return. There was a report... It was almost in real time. When they were on the plane, Wolfgang was writing a letter and before they landed in Tel Aviv, in Israel, he gave the letter to Teddy. Wait a minute. Later, I was also reading this letter. And I never in my life read a love letter like that. Not in real life and also not in a novel. You know till this day, Teddy did not even know that he was married in Israel. She did not know that he had a son. And this letter covered everything. Covered this and covered the love he had for Teddy. Rivka told me she knows it was a woman the Mossad coupled him with. She was sure of it. Rivka continued believing that for 3 years, till his release. | tried somehow... to shake her belief that he'd return home. She went to the most expensive store in town, bought the nicest dress and she prepared to go meet him at the airport. Then at the last moment, she was told: "Don't get dressed. You're not going." They didn't give her a clue that he wasn't coming back to her. She didn't know. The Mossad asked for some technical help from me. They asked me to receive them and to announce there's another woman involved. They said: "How will we tell them?" | said: "Now you ask?" You should have asked that many years ago. So they said: "'Can you do something?" | said: "Okay. I'll take Udi. I'll explain it to him first." Not to Rivka, because I think Rivka would have fainted. | was told: "Dad is arriving tomorrow and he's not going back to Mom. He's not coming back home." There was no way to smoothen it, to change it or soften the blow. These were the hard facts. Udi? I think he reacted like a stone. He didn't even blink. He must know how to hide his emotions. He knew back then and I think he's even better at it today. | went home and Dad was standing at the entrance, waiting for me. We hugged, we kissed. And... There were some tears and... | was very very happy and excited that Dad had arrived. On the other hand, I didn't feel intimate or close with him. | didn't feel I could really open up and share with him all the experiences I'd gone through. Tel Aviv 1968 When he came back with Waltraud, all those receptions. He was received with great honor. He was famous. Everyone... He'd give lectures, appear in public and tell stories. "I Was a Spy in Cairo" He tried to drag the stage he had in Egypt back to the rest of the world. Including to Israel. In one way, the fact he was imprisoned allowed him to continue living on stage in Tel Aviv. People recognized him, he appeared on TV, he talked on the radio. He wrote a book. | was angry. Because... Of what he did to Mom. | knew she was terribly disappointed. | think she expected Dad to come back home. She was afraid of the possibility he wouldn't, but still hoped he would. And here was the moment we'd waited for. He was released and returned and she wasn't a part of any of that. | knew that for her it was a bitter disappointment. What's the life of a retired spy like? Like any other retired officer. A pension? -A pension. If they asked you to be... How did you call it? A permanent agent... A resident agent. -A resident agent in an enemy country today, would you? That's a hypothetical question because I'm already exposed. But if it was possible I'd excuse myself right now and go. It's so... Yes. Do you miss it? -Often. Reality after the mission is hard. There you are a king. Here you're just a pawn. There's no doubt there's a crisis. It's a crisis. We helped him recuperate. We helped him establish a horse ranch in Ganot. The cover story was so much a part of him and fit him so well and it fit his aspirations so well, that when he finished his job it was hard for him to stop and say: ‚ÄúI'm done. Now I'm just a regular person." His standard of living was high, but now he had to pay for it, from his own pocket. And that source became more and more depleted and there was nothing to fill it up so he reached a point where he became bitter. Ganot was a failure. They lived in a rented house. He didn't have his own house. She rode horses with him, but she suffered from thrombosis from her time in prison. She had a brain hemorrhage. After Waltrauds death, he was devastated. I've never seen him like that. He cried. He looked physically devastated. It was very hard for him. | think what made us closer was the fact he was in mourning and I was with him every day, for a few days. | helped him and went to the funeral with him. That made us closer. | think he really appreciated that. He appreciated me coming with him, being at the funeral and so forth. Yes, yes. It made us closer. It wasn't her death that made us closer, but... his need made us closer. After her death he became lost I think. He didn't find his place. Not mentally nor physically. Waltraud served as a compass for him. She showed him the way. After her death he was going in circles. He was crying all day for 6 months. Alone. What can you do alone? In Ganot. No one took care of him. But that's the responsibility of his superiors. You can't leave people like that alone. His loneliness led him to all Kinds of places which I didn't know. A relationship with one woman, and with another. An attempt to build a new life. He was sick of it. Everything he touched failed. The debts piled up. He wasn't the type to lower expenses. He got used to a standard of living which he couldn't afford and he thought he'd be better off somewhere else. In 1977 we arrived in Germany. We lived in a small motel on the road to Stuttgart. It was a room in the attic. There was no bathroom. There was a sink, a bed and our bags. He started working at ,, Kaufhof‚Äú in the fishing department. It was torture. He was on his feet from 10 am to 7 pm. He had two breaks during the day. Half an hour. That's it. | saw what was left of the legend. It was a far cry from Cairo. At some point he was fired. We were left with no money. One day he got an offer to write a book, so he said to me in the most rude and vulgar way possible... that I wasn't stylish enough to live the lifestyle he was going to live. All the red lights started flashing in my mind because I knew a woman was involved. I knew him. One of the reasons I think he stayed here wasn't from love for Germany, but rather his shame. His financial situation there was bad and I know he borrowed money from people and anyone he could. He asked me to help him financially. For him it must've been a huge effort. To overcome his ego, his shame and I think it really was... | understood when he asked me... | understood it was a last resort, because it wasn't in his character to ask. | was very sad. | pitied him. One day I was notified he was ill and in a bad state and that I should come. | went inside. He smiled and said: "You came for the wake, eh?" He had a sense of humor till the very end. So I said: "Forget it. Come on." We started... | tried to get him to talk and he looked very worried. Very old. | hadn't seen him in a long time so it was quite a shock. There were many things which weren't said. They were expressed in a look, in the presence, in emotion, but they weren't actually said. One way or another I'd ask him if he ever thought about the price others paid for... for the incredible life he had. Because... all the people around him, in one way or another, were hurt or suffered. From his closest relatives to Waltraud, to the people around him in Egypt when he was a spy... In the end, anyone who was somewhat close to him was hurt somehow. | forgive him for what he did to me. | don't have a problem with it. | don't forgive him for what he did to my Mom. | don't have the means or the ability to forgive him for that.
