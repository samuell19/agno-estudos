Prince.. Prince! Prince.. Prince! Prince.. - Prince! Prince.. - Prince! Prince! Prince! Prince.. - Prince! Prince.. - Prince! Prince.. - Prince! Your honour, it's an insult on humanity.. ...to call this accused a human. This person is more criminal than the crime. More shameful than shame itself. And more monstrous than a monster. Because this tormentor who is called Zorawar.. ...has painted such a dreadful picture.. ...of his crimes on the existence of humanity.. ...of which each stroke is painted.. ...with human blood, your honour. There is only one punishment meant.. ...for such a criminal and that is the death sentence! Judge, till date I have used my brawn to my advantage. But today, I wish to join my hands and ask the court.. ...that why didn't anyone try to understand.. ...why captain Zorawar became a criminal? The gun which I had picked up to protect the country. Why did I have to use it for my own benefit! Even I had a happy family. Loving parents.. An innocent younger sister. And I had the love of a girl whom I was supposed to marry. Even if the world thought that Zorawar Singh is dead.. ...how did your love believe that? If you can, look inside me, I still am all yours. If this is true then this.. Why are you getting married to someone else? Whenever an Indian woman is dead and was married.. ...she is dressed in a similar fashion. If you wouldn't have come today.. ...l rather than marring someone else.. ...l would have turned myself into ashes. Look at this. Yes. Poison. Padmini, I am proud of you. You were, are and always will be mine. Aunt! Aunt! Zorawar eloped with Padmini. What nonsense! Are you in your senses? Zorawar is dead. No uncle, he is alive, I have seen him with my own eyes. This means that that rascal is still alive. He has not picked up a Thakur family's bride. But invited his own death. There is no use of cribbing after the damage is done, Thakur. No elder brother, no. You crib when the damage is already done. We will kill him before he leaves this place. Words do no good, Lakhan. No one has slapped the Thakurs like this. We were defamed in front of the entire village. And these people who used to bow in front of us. From tomorrow these same people will joke on us. That the landlords of Haripur are so weak and coward.. ...that the women of their family can.. ...be eloped anytime by anyone. Roshan.. don't instigate the fire within me so much.. ...that I set the whole village on fire instead of Zorawar. He has defamed us, and we will gift him death. Where is that rascal Zorawar? He.. - We don't know. And even if knew then too no parent.. ...who send death to their son. No! No! Nikki's father! Rascal! Mother! Mother will be very pleased to see you like this with me. Just hold on here. - Why? You are coming into my house as a bride for the first time. Mother will come and take you in with ritual gifts. My sister will come, perform rituals. Fine? Mother.. father. Mother.. father. How did all this happen! Oh God! What all desires I had for you. Those tormenters didn't even spare you! Who were they? Who were they! Who were they! I ask who were the ones who.. ...murdered my parents and my sister! Why are you all so quiet.. at least someone answer me! What will these cowards tell, Zorawar! Ask me, I will tell you. The one to weight your younger sister's and old parents'.. ...dead bodies to your shoulders are the torturous.. ...Thakur Hakim Singh and his brother Lakhan Singh. Thakuﬂ Zorawar. Zorawar. Bhiku, Ramu, Kalu, save me! Help me! Kill the rascal! Kill the rascal! Kill him. No! No! No, Zorawar. No. No? Imp! Rogue! I can still see my innocent sister.. ...and my parents squirming in your eyes. Today I shall drown you in your own blood. Zorawar. Zorawar, don't forget that you are a soldier. Don't try to take the law in your hands. Today even your law cannot save him! Don't try to escape! I will not spare him, inspector. Gauri, don't scream, I am not your enemy. I am shot. And I need your help now. Before the poison spreads in, bring me a knife. Heat a knife and get it. - Ok. I will remove this bullet. You come in. You are bleeding profusely. I will just make a medicine for you. Padmini. Padmini. Padmini. Padmini. Padmini. You came. Padmini. Come to me. No. No. No.. this.. this.. oh God, what have I done! L.. I have.. this.. this is a grave sin. Gauri. Gauri. Brother. Brother. Brother.. Brother! What happened, Gauri? Brother! Brother! - What happened? What is it? What is it? Tell me Gauri, what is it! - No!.. Tell me. - Brother.. brother.. No! No! - Gauri, won't you tell your brother? Tell me what happened. Tell me. Yes, tell me. Brother, he.. he.. Zorawar. Brother.. brother, kill this rapist! He.. he is no circumstantial criminal. He is a criminal since birth. He is a felon since birth! I agree that I am a culprit but.. ...But how did it all happen.. - I supported him. But this rogue took my right to live with dignity. Yes brother, he.. he.. he has.. he has raped me, brother! He raped me! Rogue! Elf! I thought of you as a victim of atrocities of society. And you.. - No! No, inspector. No.. I still have to do a lot of things. I have sinned. And I am ready to face any punishment. But till I don't fulfill my promise, you cannot shoot me. And after that I will surrender myself to you. You can shoot all the bullets in me. No Zorawar, no. This brother will sentence you death.. ...now here at this very moment for this sin. No. I say no! Kill him, brother. Kill this rascal! Kill him, brother. Kill him. Kill him! Kill him! Brother! Brother! No! Brother. I ask have our department gone so weak.. ...or crime has become more powerful than law.. ...that we cannot get Zorawar arrested? Today we lost an able police officer like Shankar Shrivastava. His innocent sister Gauri was raped.. ...and she committed suicide. Who is responsible for all this? Zorawar Singh. And Zorawar Singh's only aim is Hakim Singh. If you wish to arrest Zorawar Singh.. ...then surround Hakim Singh with so many policemen.. ...that even a shadow cannot escape them. I am sure that Zorawar will surely come there. After hearing my story you tell me, priest.. ...what right does a person like me to live? Dear, I was.. - No, priest. No. You did no good by saving me. But instead increased a sin in this world. No, dear. No. Don't say such things in God's presence. Don't take your God's name! He just smiles at people's helplessness and vulnerability. Ask him, priest! Ask him, what harm I had caused him! He has taken everything away from me.. ...and gave me a blemish such that cannot be washed away. The thing you consider a blemish.. ...Is a new creation of lord Shankar. Dear, suicide is a crime. And even if you wish to die you have no right.. ...to kill someone with you. Yes dear, you are pregnant. Now you are not just a girl but.. ...also a mother to an unborn child. Wow, God. Great! Nice justice. You distributed nectar to the world and had the poison. And you were hence named 'Neelkanth'. The poison which your world has give me.. ...what should I name that? Yes? Tell me? Why don't you answer me? What will you say! I shall speak today! Now I won't die! I will drink this poison and stay alive! Got it? If there is any truth in yourjustice.. ...then give this unmarried mother such a son.. ...such a son which the whole world considers 'Neelkanth'. Yes, yes considers him as 'Neelkanth'! Congratulations, dear. It's a boy. The Prince of the world of my sadness. I being a mother too cannot give you anything other than hatred. You have taken birth in lord Shankar's temple. And even my brother's name was Shankar. Who sacrificed himself for his ill-fated sister! So.. I will name you Shankar. Yes, from today you are my 'Neelkanth'. And.. you only are my Shankar. You only are my Shankar. My child, I will tell you a story. My child, I will tell you a story. I will tell you who killed your mother. I will share my sorrows with you. I will tell you who killed your mother. I will tell you who killed your mother. I will bestow my life and make you dearer than life. I will bestow my life and make you dearer than life. You are like a flower I will make you an ember! I shall ignite the fire of revenge within you. I shall ignite the fire of revenge within you. I will tell you who killed your mother. I will tell you who killed your mother. Dear, the snake! Don't worry, priest. Only the fangs of a snake are poisonous. But his whole body is poisonous. Snake can cause him no harm. Iam ruined! Iam ruined, nothing else remains! Now I will make the world cry, I won't. Today I will surely shed a few tears. Today I will surely shed a few tears. I will tell you who killed your mother. I will tell you who killed your mother. I have written that tormentor's name on your heart! I have written that tormentor's name on your heart! You have to take my revenge from my enemy. My revenge! Notjust milk; lwill feed you my blood. Notjust milk; lwill feed you my blood. I will tell you who killed your mother. Till when? Till when will we wander in the jungles like this? I didn't say anything in the past. But now.. now we have our child with us. We can endure punishment but why punish this innocent child? Why cast a shadow on his future? You should forget your revenge. And start afresh with your Suraj. Padmini.. Now my life will begin when Hakim Singh will die. Village head. - Yes, sir? The seed that I had implanted 10 years ago.. I didn't get you, sir. You might remember, it's was Lakhan's wedding that day. Ancl my intelligence turned his wedding into a funeral. And this faithful risking his life instigated Zorawar.. ...about Lakhan and Hakim. But why all this, sir? Why? For what? The property of Haripur and wealth worth crores of rupees.. ...have always been hurting my eyes. And my cousins are the heir to it. Until there is bloodshed, the heirs don't change. Whom do you wish to kill, sir? Just me the orders, sir. Your faithful is here. Iam proud of you, village head. You are my confidante and helper too. I will get you out of this dirty village.. ...and take you to the city. Hail to you, sir. Hail to you. And your only innocent child. She will grow up and start a new life. Right, dear? When will all this happen, sir? Tonight, village head. Tonight is Hakim's wedding and Zorawar is coming to kill him. Forgive me sir, but whenever Zorawar Singh.. ...will know that even you were responsible.. ...for his family's destruction, then? What will happen then? Nothing will happen, village head. Zorawar will kill Hakim Singh. And after that even Zorawar will not survive. And this too will be to my credit. This is called intelligence! Sir. Officers. - Yes, sir. Zorawar has left to ruin Hakim Singh's wedding. Yes, sir. That's the reason I have come here. So you will leave and guard the main gate. Ok, sir. Remember no one should pass by. Come on. Yes, go out and guard. Now S.P himself has come to guard me. S. P, thank you very much for taking care of me. Hakim Singh, since ages I have.. ...been only thinking about you. Zorawar. Zorawar! Forgive me, Zorawar. Only this rascal is my enemy. If anyone makes a move will have to dare the consequences. Zorawar! You have taken your revenge.. ...but you still have to pay for my wounds. Look at me very carefully. You will see your dreadful sin. Remember the night you came to my house half dead. You were bleeding from your wound. You were begging for mercy from your eyes. I relieved you from the pain of the bullet. But you.. as your pain subsided, you raped me! Remembered? Did you remember your crime? And now look.. Shankar.. Zorawar, look at him very carefully! This is your tomorrow, your death. He will seek revenge for his mother's tears with your blood. The fruit of your sins. Your own blood will kill you! I have given birth to him just to kill you! Zorawar, this is that poisonous weapon.. ...of an anguished woman, which.. ...will soon be planted on your chest. Leave me! Zorawar, don't think that I did you a favour by saving you. If you would have been killed by someone else. Then.. then the motive for my son.. ...to live would have been dead. Only my son will shoot at you! Like this mother lived.. ...squirming and writhing. Similarly.. you too.. will squirm and die. Then only.. then only will my revenge be complete. Then only.. will my soul rest in peace. Mother! This crime has traumatized me, judge. I am shattered, judge. I am shattered, judge. I am shattered, judge. So l.. hang me again and again. Hang me again and again, judge. So that I can pay for my sins. So that I can pay for my sins, judge. Zorawar Singh, you are ashamed of your sins. And you have respected the law by surrendering yourself. Hence the court sentences you with.. ...life imprisonment rather than the death sentence. Padmini, I am a criminal by law but.. ...l am also a bigger criminal to you. I have.. I have disgraced your status. No, a person's sins are known by his intentions. I understand that you didn't intend to do what you did. You are so great, Padmini. You can forget my sins but the.. ...world will never forget my sins. So.. if Suraj grows up and asks about his father.. ...then tell him that he was a soldier and died in the battlefield. For God's sake don't say that. I don't know that when my son grows up and hears.. ...my name.. people taunt him with my name. My crimes and sins make his life miserable. Hence you being married will have to live a widow's life. Yes, Padmini. One punishment is given to me by the law.. ...and I am giving you one punishment. You will lead a life of a widow. Promise me. Promise me. Promise me, Padmini. You are everything to me. How can l.. I promise. Padmini.. Take care of Suraj. Take care of yourself. Jailer, I am the one who made.. ...Shankar an orphan and stray. And I also know that Shankar hates me a lot. But I won't be able to tolerate that tomorrow.. ...Shankar too turns out to be a criminal like me. Walk the ways of sin. I have a request to you, that if you can lead him.. ...a good way with my hard earned money. Make him a police officer like yourself.. ...then my sins will be well repented. Shankar your exams begin from today.. ...pass out with flying colours! Yes, father. - Bless you. I have written that tormentor's name on your heart! I have written that tormentor's name on your heart! You have to take my revenge from my enemy. My revenge. 'Our son Suraj has grown taller than his mother.' 'You will be pleased to know that he has opened up.. ...a small garage in the hamlet itself.' 'He only lives for his mother.' 'l haven't told him anything about you.' Place the bet! Get the double! Get the double! Pay up! Pay up! The last one for today, eight! Pay up! Pay up! Come on hurry up! Get the double! Get the double! Hey the number nine's money.. Hey body builder! Hey, you are gambling in Suraj's area! Do you wish to die young? What did you say? Damn, he is telling the truth. Your body will be a mess once Suraj comes. He will smash you so well that you will.. ...fall flat on that board like a powder and skate.. ...and fall into the basket like in the game of carom. Body builder, do one thing give.. ...us your photograph and a garland. Because Suraj is going to kill you. He hit me! He hit me! He hit me! He hit me! Leave unnoticed! Pick him up. With respect, honour, attention! The cherished of our hamlet! The leader of the poor. Our prince.. - ls coming! Prince. Prince. Hey sinfully blown out of proportioned watermelon. Cheat, rotten tomato! Ugly face, blind! Didn't you hear that, fool? Prince, Prince I have promised to remove gambling.. ...liquor and betting from this hamlet. I am the.. - Prince of the poor! Very good, soldiers! So you have come to remove my gambling joint! I will remove you too, dear. But what to do dear, lam a mechanic. So like a car I first test a human brain. Like what and which part has what problem. If the carbonator is filled with dirt, then I clean it. If there is water in operator's oil then I shut its engine down. Hey, stop your nonsense! Rascal, hippo, fool! Your car is a total loss. I think with the car, the body and brake too need repairs. Or else this car will never start or leave this hamlet. Brother, this is no push and drive car. This is a hit car! Soldiers! - Prince! Pick up this crocodile and throw him out! Yes. Pick up this fool! Son. What do you think that by hitting him.. ...you saved this hamlet from ruination? No, son, no. This hamlet is infested by the termites.. ...which will soon swallow all these houses. What are you saying, aunt! Yes, son. If you want to save this hamlet, then save my husband. Who has lost most of the houses here in the derby club. Our ancestral land in which our ancestors.. ...once give you all a right to live. That right is being snatched away from you, son. His obsession for gambling and cheating by gamblers.. ...Is slowly-slowly eating up this hamlet. Son, save this hamlet from ruination. Save it, son. Suraj has faced a lot of the fire of poverty and hunger. He won't let this hamlet catch fire! This Suraj will get rid of that hub of illegal activity! 50,000. - 50,000. Once more. Brother Shanti, don't get so hyper, declare your cards. Declare them. You are strange now I have got he turn to win back.. ...the half lost property of the hamlet. How can I declare it! A lakh. Who are you! I am a storm to wash out cheat, bluff, con and blag! And if one gets a high of cheating.. Then I am the dangerous wielding.. ...fire to burn the one into ashes. And if someone tries have bad intentions for our hamlet.. ...then I am the devil to take his life away. How dare you enter the club! Look clear, I will show you my strength and guts later. First let me get the cheating out in the open. Yqu! Look brother Shanti, this is what goes on in this club. 0h, you guys cheat! Such clubs are famous for cheating and crimes, brother Shanti. But now I won't let these rascals.. ...write the destiny of our hamlet with cards. Who did this to you? Mr. Rai, a stranger entered the casino and..And.. ...created a mess and went away. Bob, I have trained some dangerous dogs to guard my house. Who bark and bite the strangers. And when these dogs can't bark and bite. Then l.. Mr. Rai! Mr. Rai! One minute! One minute! What do you want! What do you want! Won't you let your mother live easy in this old age? These fights and tiffs have taken all pleasures off my life. L.. now don't trouble me, son. I can't shatter and settle again now. But mother, I didn't fight with anyone. Dare not lie to me! Why did you go to the casino! Tell me! Why are you so quiet? You don't understand today you fight them.. ...tomorrow they will come to fight you. And thus the enmity will increase. And the consequence.. Enmity has a very bad consequence, son. What's the harm is fighting in the casino, brother? And you get thrashed for no reason. You are talking about slaps; I would happily die for my mother. She is not my mother.. but a God for me. And then there is special love in a mother's slaps. Only the one who loves has the right to hit. Now you all tell me, who does.. ...mother have other than me? And whom do I have other than mother? No one. We both are all alone without each other. There is light in my life because of mother. If there is no mother then there is darkness. That's the reason you trouble your mother so much. Right? - Mother, I swear on you, I will never on.. ...purpose hurt your feelings, go against your teachings. Suraj will never dare to do so. But the situation was such, mother. That my white looks black to you. May be it's my destiny which is written in black. I will give you a tight slap if you say that again. Ok come, come have dinner. I have brought dinner for all of you. No mother, you keep the dinner, we will have it later. Why? We have to repair a truck. Hey the old model big boot Chevrolet. How dare you bring country liquor in our hamlet! Hey the rotten son of a dead elephant.. ...l will lock you up in a bottle and cork you such.. ...that you all stale all your life like a useless engine oil. And then give you such a servicing that.. ...all your fat will melt and enter your bones. Soldiers. - Prince! Take it. - Take everything! - Give me the bottles. Here! Why are you breaking the bottles? Hey hippo! Remember that this Hitler is one of Bijli's men. Bijli will not spare you! Go and tell Bijli my name. If she doesn't get scared of my power.. ...and leave the city then my name is not Suraj. Hey rasca_l, I am _'_B_ijli' (llghtenlng). Bljll! I give a jolt of 360 volts! And then loafers like you seek hospital beds. Or then the graveyard! But Bijli, l.. - Shut up, cheating in Bijli's bar! Yes? Cheating with the liquor bottles! Rascal, you look for share in everyone's glass. Sometimes eats someone's cashew. And sometimes someone's wafers! If someone is high, then there goes his bottle. Get out! Get out! I say get out of here! You.. Bijli, you are throwing him out of here but he.. Hey Hitler, Bijli has already lost it, don't chatter. Come on pay for the bottles. What bottles, he defused me! What! - He broke all the bottles! Who wishes to die? Who is he? Hey the prince of honesty, come out! If don't crush your bones into a soup and.. ...serve your meat as kebabs then my name is not Bijli. Yes. - Yes. Hey drunkard, I will.. - Suraj. Now will my brave son fight a woman? Hey mother.. - There is no one who can fight Bijli. Bijli sells liquor. Just liquor, doesn't steal or pickpockets! Got it? I have 14 years license! 14 years! Acts smart, rascal! You.. you will shut down my bar! I sell real goods, real goods! Or else all village drunkards would have died.. ...long back drinking the gutter water, rascal. Mother, now you tell me does.. ...he have the license to break my bottles? Hey hollow prince, remember I will thrash you such.. ...that you will stop looking at your face in the mirror. If I see you again, you will walk when you come in.. ...but need support when you walk out. Iwill rupture you! Greetings, mother. Let's go, fatso. You got your goods, Jack. But where are my goods? There is the price for your goods. These diamonds are worth 5 crores. Ok. - Thank you. Bye. Come on. Come on, let's move. Mother. Who are you? Poison for the people living in the illegal world. Whether the crime is taking place in sky, or the depths of hell.. ...my hand becomes the noose for punishment.. ...and nabs the enemy's neck. Get out of our way, inspector. Prince. You can get rid of a wall from your way.. ...but not a mountain like Shankar. Kill him. Thank you, madam. Where are the diamonds? Tell me, where are the diamonds! Wow Aarti, you pull off our goods.. ...from the police like a hair in butter. I should venerate you so that no evil eye casts on you. But Bhima has caught police's eye. And I know how I got out there today. Mr. Rai, till when, till when will you make me do illegal things! Until your father is in my custody. And what about the day I get caught? Then your father will die. You will kill my father.. - Yes. If you are caught your father dies. So, whenever you go out for my work.. ...come back successful. And think of this criminal deed as a holy deed for your father. And then I will not making you do this for free. Whenever you come back successful.. ...l make you meet your father atleast once. Father. My child. My child. - Father.. father. Don't call me father. Don't! I am not worthy of being called your father. I got greedy and committed the sins.. ...and now my child is enduring for them. I won't die! L.. I to ruin that innocent Zorawar Singh.. ...gave support to these sinners, dear. Gave my full support. Iwish. I wish I could meet Zorawar Singh just once.. ...then I would touch his feet and beg forgiveness for my sins. So that I can peacefully take my last breath. Dear, dear, listen to me. Listen to me carefully. There is nothing left in my life now. Don't worry about me. You run away from here. Run, dear, get far away from these sinners, dear. No father, no. I have no one other than you in this world. I cannot leave you and go.. I cannot go.. ...Very good, village head. You are teaching your daughter to run! Catch her. You should be thankful that I kept you alive.. ...even though you are my confidante. Or else.. even death can't let a person out of my grip. Roshan Singh, fear God. His hurt doesn't give a forewarning. The day there is a noose in your neck.. ...you will release what great sinner you are. Law! I swirl the law on my palm like a top. I twist and turn it whenever I want. And when needed I make the law my friend.. ...and sent it to my enemy with a message of death. Give me an ice-candy. How much? Who amongst you is Suraj? Big brother.. that's me! So you are the worshipper of ember! The place you pass lights up in fire! You need to wield to get a body right. And the fire accompanies spark and ember. I throw men like you into live fire! Very good. I don't wish to fight in my shop, big brother. To go into the club of respectable men like Mr. Rai.. ...and do riots is what you like! Oh.. so you are the arrow shot by the enemy? Not the arrow but the sword. Which injures the enemy such.. ...that they reach their final destination. The one who went to Rai's club.. ...broke bones and sent them to hospital.. ...you have come to threaten him and that too all alone? Since childhood Shankar has fought all wars alone. Then this will be the last war of your life. Prince! Prince! Prince! Prince! Prince! Prince! Suraj! No son, no. Forgive him. I have no one other than him in my life. Mother, you are apologizing to him. - Yes. - Him! Yes son, I will have to apologies for what.. ...my family has done. Mother, it's not my fault. This is that Mr. Rai's fault. Who wants to annex this hamlet land! And he is his right hand! - Shut up! Iam no right or left hand of any Mr. Rai. I am a police officer and I had come to punish you. And listen, you were saved because of your mother today. Whoever's mother I respect the word mother. Even I respect the law. But I didn't know the truth. The style in which you entered.. ...l felt you have come to seek revenge for Mr. Rai. The rampage you did in the club.. ...l spare you for that, taking that to be your first mistake. If you repeat any such thing then.. ...you will remember what I do to you! What are you saying, Padmini! Iam telling the truth. Today was the first time I saw Shankar. He looks exactly like you. You want to wash your sins with repenting tears.. ...and he.. wants to burn everything.. ...with his fire of revenge. Today he left a fight because of a mother. But if he comes to know that Suraj is your son.. ...then what will happen? Nothing will happen. You don't worry, Padmini. If needed I will wash off his revenge's need with my blood. I even worry for Suraj. His heat might get him to a place where he can't hear me! No, no.. God can't be so unjust to us. You have endured a lot of pain, Padmini. Enough of all this. Who are you all? Where are you going! - Leave me! Leave! Leave me! ls someone there? Help me! Leave me! I say leave me! Help! Help! Leave me! ls someone there! Help! Leave me! I have written that tormentor's name on your heart! I have written that tormentor's name on your heart! Now you have to seek revenge. - Shankar! Shankar! Come back to your senses, Shankar! He is Zorawar Singh! He is Zorawar Singh, jailer! You have gone crazy! Yes. Yes I have gone crazy. When I see these criminals, I see Zorawar. And when I see his face, I go crazy, jailer. L go crazy. Soldiers! - Prince! You take care of the garage I am going to repairjailer's car. Hey prince, will you all your life just repair other's cars? Look the madam is back again. Shut up! - What shut up! You are back again! Why is this Dubai? Do I need visa to come here? Hey look, if I lose it then I will move my hands.. ...such that you will directly land up in the hospital. Got it? - Really, even I wish to go the hospital. But you don't do anything! Hey what do you mean? Bring a wedding procession, get married. Have your wedding night and after that.. Careful! - Hospital! I will marry a drunkard like you! A liquor seller? Hey, you get a high after you drink my liquor. But what such is there in your face.. ...that I get a high just by looking at it. And I climb up the steps of your garage. Will you leave or should I apply grease on your face? Hey not the grease, apply vermillion on my forehead. A nose pin for my nose. Bangles in my hand. A sacred thread in my neck. Enough. Enough. The politician is_here. Politician, greetings! Politician! You bluffed me again! Jailer, quickly give me your car keys. Hey brother, hey.. what did you hide in your pocket? Yes? Yes, sir? Nothing, sir. Nothing. Nothing? Aren't you ashamed to lift jailer's things in his absence? Get it out, fast! Sir, I didn't lift anything from here. Look my mother has also taught me not.. ...to listen to a lie along with not to lie. If the criminals are even given a little liberty.. ...then they will tear the law apart. Get it out. - What happened? What happened, Suraj? Look jailer, a scorpion can stop stinging. And a snake can stop to bite but.. ...these criminals in white uniform.. ...cannot stop doing what they do. What? - He just took a thing from here.. ...and hid it in his pocket. Really? - No, jailer. What did you lift? Jailer, what shall I hide from you, look. Look at this. This is his wife and son's photograph.. ...whom he loves a lot. What love! What emotions! Didn't he even think once while taking up crime.. ...about his wife and his children? When he went to prison he started loving their photograph! A man can endure a harsher punishment. Imagine. Just imagine how his wife must be suffering.. ...along with her innocent child close to her chest. He has taken up a punishment from law. And he has also given a punishment to his family. Suraj, you didn't do a right thing by hurting his feelings. He is the only true human behind these bars.. ...who has crossed all limits of being great! Son, unknowingly he committed a sin. He is enduring that punishment.. ...which is even worse that this punishment, by repenting. To hurt his feelings is like hurting God's feelings. Hey, father! Father! My father, you.. forgive me. Look, I don't know anything. But the jailer says that you are a very good man. You are gold. Pure gold! And even a goldsmith can make mistake. Father, I am just a mechanic. Son, since you have called me father then hug me just once. Hug me, son. Father, I don't have a father. But had he been alive, I would have gotten.. ...then same love from him which I got after embracing you. Forgive me, father. Son. Bless you, son. Son, my child. Bless you. Bless you.

You won't! - No! No! No! Leave! Leave my husband! Leave him! For God's sake leave him! Leave him. Leave him.. No! Hey stop! Stop! l.. I will sign! Iwill sign. I will sign. - Stop, even I will give one of my signatures, sir. But not on this lifeless paper, your faces! And I will sign such that from today.. ...whenever you will dare to look into the mirror. You will only be able to see my signature! You won't be able to see your face! I will prepare Suraj's funeral pyre, I will! Look my can has broken down on the way.. ...please come and repair it. I don't have time, I am very busy. Please come. Look madam, there are so many cars here. I will spend my whole day in repairing them.. ...l don't have time now. You can go to another mechanic. Greetings, mother. - You, dear. Are you alright? My car broke down on the way. He doesn't have the time to repair. No time? You come with me. Suraj. - Yes, mother. Did you get the lunch? Hey she is the one who saved my life that day. Mother! Your mother is alive because of this girl. Forgive me, mother. Forgive me. The one who saved Suraj's mother's life.. ...Suraj can sacrifice not one but many lives on that person. Come madam, where do we have to go? Come. Listen, there is my car. Ok this car, I will check it. You don't worry. You start the car. Prince! Prince! What harm had I caused you! You did my mother a favour and you also planned to kill me! Tell me fast or else lwill kill you. No Suraj, no. Had Aarti wanted to get you killed.. ...by these people then she couldn't have.. ...called me here to save you. Such conspirers don't pity, Shankar. And even if they do, they have a motive behind it. Yes, I have conspired. Laid a trap of deception and ruse. I have committed a sin by my conscience by.. ...calling you here with a lie. Had I known that your life was in danger here.. ...l would have rather died but not called you here. But what can I do, I am just a toy. Someone who cries and wipes her own tears. My father is under their captivity. He is living amidst the wounds, lesions.. ...and injuries given by them. I have to follow their orders. If I don't obey them then they will kill my father. They will kill him! Aarti, I trust you. I will try by best to get your father free. If that is the case then even Suraj is with you. Suraj always hates injustice! If I get the power of your brawn. Then we will melt crime however hard it might be. Slowly-slowly. Slowly-slowly. Quietly-quietly. Secretly. Secretly. Secretly. Discreetly! Discreetly! Slowly-slowly. Quietly-quietly. Secretly. Secretly. Discreetly! Discreetly! Talks.. these meetings. No story should be made out of this. It might turn out to be an indicator of danger. Slowly-slowly. Quietly. Quietly. Secretly. Secretly. Secretly. Discreetly! Discreetly! Talks.. these meetings. No story should be made out of this. It might turn out to be an indicator of danger. Slowly-slowly. Quietly. Quietly. Secretly. Secretly. Discreetly! Discreetly! We are thirsty, quench our thirst. Spread your tresses. We are thirsty, quench our thirst. Spread your tresses. I will love the one, who will die for me. Such kind of a person will become my lover. No story should be made out of this. It might turn out to be an indicator of danger. Slowly-slowly. Quietly. Quietly. Secretly. Secretly. Secretly. Discreetly! Discreetly! A beauty, thousand lovers! A damsel, thousand rescuers. A beauty, thousand lovers! A damsel, thousand rescuers. Don't play with fire. Wonder what might happen! When we touch fire it turns into water. No story should be made out of this. It might turn out to be an indicator of danger. Slowly-slowly. Quietly. Quietly. Secretly. Secretly. Secretly. Discreetly! Discreetly! Talks.. these meetings. No story should be made out of this. It might turn out to be an indicator of danger. Slowly-slowly. Quietly. Quietly. Secretly. Secretly! Secretly! Help! Help! Zorawar. What do you know about Zorawar? What do you know about Zorawar! What do you know about Zorawar! I am asking what do you know about Zorawar! Where is Zorawar? I ask, where is Zorawar! Where is Zorawar? Where is Zorawar! I have written that tormentor's name on your heart! I have written that tormentor's name on your heart! You have to take my revenge from my enemy. My revenge! - Zorawar! Shankar, I will tell you. Zorawar is no longer in this prison. He has been freed. Jailer. Great jailer, you call me son and you gave me.. ...such a big betrayal being a father. You didn't have Zorawar imprisoned in your prison. Instead to had kept him in your.. ...prison to save his life from me. Today.. today by keeping his release a secret.. ...you have made yourself a criminal in my eyes. Son, I was waiting for the anger in you.. ...for Zorawar to reduce. Suraj. My son.. My son. Soldiers! - Prince! What happened? Father, you. Hey, you.. - No, son. No. That poor fellow is not at fault. It's my fault. I had lost my sense for sometime. Father.. hey why is there so much commotion here? Hey out of here, come on! Come on! - Come on. Come, father. - Move on. Yours.. mine.. Bless you, son. Bless you. Are you hurt, father? - No son, I am fine. Tell me something, father. When did you get released from prison? This was my last day of the sentenced punishment. But I think my internal punishment shall never get over. No father, no. What are you saying! Son, the journey to meet my loved ones is tougher.. ...than the punishment of the prison. They being so close to me are yet so far away from me. Father, blood beckons blood. You see one day your family will come to you. But it is possible that they might see me.. ...as a criminal and hold their step back. They might turn away. Father, time heals everything. Look, even the sun sets and mixes into sea in the evening. Similarly you will surely get your family back one clay, father. Son, what you said has given me a lot of peace. But still, I don't know why I fear. No, father, no. Till your fear doesn't subside you will stay here, in this hamlet. You will stay in my house. No son, no. I don't want to burden you. Son.. Father, you have called me son. Right? Is a father ever a burden on the son? I will not listen to you. You cannot refuse. You are under my oath. - No, no son. Don't give oaths. If you say so.. ok I will stay with you. Mother. Mother. - Coming. Mother, he is the same person.. Father, she is my mother. Mother, situations have made him lonely. So I have told him, mother. That now he will stay here with us. Ok, mother? Mother, set the table for two not one. You sit here comfortably. From today this is your own house. I will just wash my hands and come back. Then we will have lunch together. Ok? Please sit, father. Padmini. Mother, where is the soap? How is the patient, doctor? As the poison of the bullet has spread, for the time being.. No doctor, he can't die. You have to save him at any cost. I can't say anything for the next 24 hours. 'Shankar has waited since ages.. ...so he can also wait for another 24 hours.' What has happened to you, Shankar? It seems like you have turned into my father's enemy. The only way to reach the person I hate is your father. Zorawar has given me such wounds.. ...which has not only hurt my souls but.. ...my whole body has turned into a wound. Can't my love cure your wounds? My wound has turned into an impaired wound. No one's love can cure it. Don't try to instigate it or else you will quiver with its pain. Doctor, save my brother's life. Trust me, everything will.. - Hurry up, doctor. He is squirming in pain. No. This is not possible. My son cannot die. Your brother can't die. Tell me that all this is a lie! Tell me! Your brother was burned in front of you all. My life support was taken away, I was handicapped.. ...and all you all did was hear him scream! Just saw him die! No! I will take such a revenge for my son's death. That for once even the almighty will get scared. I will turn that Bharat Nagar into.. ...a graveyard engulfed with fire just like in the Mahabharata. Make arrangements! A boy. A Girl. A boy and a girl used to meet secretly. One night they both got caught. Got detained in handcuffs! One night they both got caught. Got detained in handcuffs! A boy. - A Girl. A boy and a girl used to meet secretly. One night they both got caught. Got detained in handcuffs! One night they both got caught. Got detained in handcuffs! I wish darling, even we would have gotten caught. Get caught. Got seized in the handcuffs of love! Get seized! I wish even we get caught someday. Got seized in the handcuffs of love! But my fate is not so good. A boy and a girl used to meet secretly. A boy and a girl used to meet secretly. One night they both got caught. Got detained in handcuffs! Got detained in handcuffs! A boy and a girl used to meet secretly. A boy and a girl used to meet secretly. The flowers of love, not always bloom. Not always bloom. Many love, but how many unite? But how many unite? The admirer looks at the object of affection from far away! Who.. who is it? - Hey. A boy and a girl used to meet secretly. A boy and a girl used to meet secretly. One night they both got caught. Got detained in handcuffs! Come sit.. close to me. Why are there these distances in love? There is some shyness and some helplessness. There is some shyness and some helplessness. Leave me darling, don't force. A boy. A girl. A boy and a girl used to meet secretly. One night they both got caught. Got detained in handcuffs! One night they both got caught. Got detained in handcuffs! A boy and a girl used to meet secretly. A boy and a girl used to meet secretly. One night.. one night they both got caught. Got detained in handcuffs! One night they both got caught. Got detained in handcuffs! Fire! Fire! - Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Radhe, quickly arrange for water! Come on! Run! Run! Run! Run! Help! Help! Come on! Someone save my son! For God's sake save my son! Someone save my son! My son! Brother, save my son! Son! Save my son! For God's sake save my son! My child! - For God's sake save him! Suraj, here take care! For God's sake save him! - Move aside! Move aside! Leave me! Leave me.. Leave me! I say leave me! Leave me! Father.. I wish to call you saviour. You have given me a new life my saving me from the fire. Or else I would never be able to fulfill.. ...the promise given to my mother. Mother is another form of God. No fire can kill the person who.. ...has his mother's blessing, son. I bless you that may God very soon.. ...make you achieve your aim, son. Father, I will never be able to repay your favour is this life. But I will not spare the one to set the hamlet on fire. Ok father, I will make a move now. Where is Mr. Rai? - Yes? You set the hamlet on fire. I have come to arrest you. Inspector, you wish to fulfil your duty by arresting me. First fulfil that promise of yours.. ...which you had given to your dying mother.. ...that you will seek her revenge. If you wish to punish then punish your real enemy.. ...who is called Zorawar Singh. Zorawar Singh? How do you know about him? Where is he? Iam asking, where is he! You have all your life made me.. ...stick to the promises made to you. And forced to me to live like a widow. And today, today you give Shankar the blessing.. ...that he in a true sense kills my husband! What kind ofjustice is yours! What kind ofjustice! You know this very well, Padmini.. ...that I have taken all happiness away from Shankar's life. And he has nothing but hatred with him. And his hatred can go away only with Zorawar's blood. Call it a disaster or anything you want to. After all Shankar is my son. Even Suraj is your son. You also have your responsibilities towards him. What is his fault, what is it that he has done wrong? That he is an orphan even when he has a father. Look, I have happily endured.. ...all the punishments in life. But.. but I won't let injustice be done to my son. I won't! - Hey fool, God has done this injustice with us! How am I enduring this injustice.. Now you say.. say what should I do? What should I do? You.. you promise me. You promise me.. ...that now on you will never go in front of Shankar again. Come what may you will never go in front of him. If not for me then for your Suraj. Rascal! I thought of you as a helpless person and.. ...gave you a place to stay in our house. I gave you food to eat and you betrayed me! Suraj, what are you saying! Your Suraj is dead. You have ruined me. What! - Till date I have worshiped you like a goddess. But today I am ashamed to call you mother. For God's sake don't say that to her. Don't touch me. Imp! Rogue! Your presence makes me sick! Today I believe that a criminal's tears.. ...are nothing but a deception. Get out of here! Rascal, get out of here! Suraj. Leave him. Get lost! - Suraj! You have abused me, my husband.. my spouse! What are you saying, mother! You had said that my father is dead. Yes, you know.. you know why? Just for you. So that your life is not shadowed with our bad luck. You could have blamed me as much as you can.. ...and I being a mother would have endured it. But you.. you to my husband.. No women in the world would tolerate.. ...anyone abusing her husband. Even if that's her own son! Mother. Mother, what have you done! All my life I longed for a father and.. ...you revealed the truth when I had lost everything.. ...with my own hands? Son, you can still rectify things. Go. Go and pacify him. The world has wounded him enough. He won't be able to tolerate this injury. Go son, go. - Yes, mother. Go and call him father, son. Father. Father. - Father. Forgive me, father. Yes, father. Suraj, my child, my ears were yearning to hear this. You called me father today. Call me father once again. Say it, my son. Father. Father. - My son. Suraj. Zorawar! Suraj, I haven't called for you but that Zorawar! Mind your tongue and enthusiasm, Shankan You are lucky that you are my friend. Or else I would have killed the one.. ...who disrespected my father. So that poisonous snake is your father! Iam giving the last warning! Mind your language! I will not spare the one who tortured my mother! I will not spare him! Suraj has yearned a lot for his father! Now nothing in this world can take away.. ...mine and my mother's happiness. You will not be able to stand in front of my revenge! Even the world cannot stop me today. No. No! 'Son, look very carefully at this sinner's face!' 'You have to kill him at any cost.' 'His death is the aim of your life!' Shankar, you wish to kill me, right? Kill me. Take your revenge. No one will stop you today. No, father, no. - No, Suraj. You are under my oath. No one will intervene today. Shankar, killing me will make your.. ...mother's soul rest in peace, won't it? Come son, kill me. Kill me, son. Don't abuse me but calling me son! Stop, Shankar! Jailer, no one can stop me today! No! Get aside! Get aside! Shankar, do you know whom are you hitting? How can I forget this face! It has made my life miserable! No Shankar, no. He is the one to give you a new life. Your life is a gift of his life's hard work. If he has brought me up to hide his sins.. ...then I promise to look after his family all my life. You don't knowjailer, I have seen.. ...my mother die a thousand times. Look at me carefully, jailer! When I look at this face in the mirror, I hate myself! Because this face too is a result of his sins! And today his sins will be washed off with his blood. Shankaﬂ - Move back, jailer! Move back, jailer. I say move back! Come with me. - Zorawar.. because of the jailer.. ...you have been spared a few more moments of life. But remember, I will seek my revenge! Zorawar! Zorawar.. it's me. Ram Singh. Ram Singh. - Yes, the village head, Ram Singh. The co-conspirer in your family's ruination. L, the imp Ram Singh. I apologies to you, forgive me, brother. Forgive me. Roshan Singh is the one to kill.. ...your parents and innocent sister. Suraj! I have brought your death with me! If I want.. then I can kill you with one blow. But no, I want to see a more dreadful.. ...scene of death than that of my son. That same struggle for life and squirming breaths. That same blood smeared body! Catch this rascal! Hit him so hard that even devil shies away! No, don't hit him! No! Rascal! Suraj, don't worry about me! Him them! Stop! You imp, rogue, enough of your sins! I will kill you along with the one who killed my son.. ...such that no one can ever dare to betray Roshan Singh again. Arjun Singh! Suraj dear! You will not be spared! You are squirming a lot, Zorawar Singh! You saw the consequences of mess with me! Men who torture the innocent are called impotent. Remember only one of your sons.. ...have been sacrificed to your sins. It is possible that your crime and injustice ruins.. ...your entire breed, rascal! Zorawar! - No, Mr. Rai! You cannot kill him, lwill kill him! Iam dying to kill him since childhood. And since I have got this opportunity today.. ...don't try to take this opportunity away from me. Move your weapon away. Yes inspector, the death from your hands will be very dreadful. Kill him. And fulfill your revenge. I have written that tormentor's name on your heart. You have to take my revenge from my enemy. You have to take my revenge from my enemy. My revenge! - No son, no. Don't do that. Today a mother begs for her husband's life in front of you. Son, please don't do that. Can you give back Shankar's mother back to him? Never! Shoot, Shankar! - No. Look. Look at me very carefully! After so many years have I got the pleasure of.. ...being married again. Don't take that away! Don't take that away, son! Don't forget Shankar, the sin this sinner has committed.. ...cannot even be forgiven my God! Shoot him! No. No son, I won't what is good or evil. But I have endured punishment.. ...all my life for no crime at all! Did your mother also give you an oath to.. ...make a married woman, widow? Make a son, orphan? Don't do this, son. Have mercy on me. - Get aside! No, son. No. - I say move back! No mother, no. Leave this stonehearted alone. Don't beg him. He only knows to talk about mother. He doesn't know.. he doesn't know what a mother is. I am surprised why he is named, Shankar! Shankar is the one to have poison and distributes nectar. But he.. he has given nothing.. ...but hatred to everyone, mother. Mother, he is no human. He is just a piece of stone. Dumb and deaf. Emotionally handicapped and ruthless! He only remembers his revenge, mother. Just his revenge! Yes, I remember my revenge. No, son! If you want to kill then first kill this monster. I know that Zorawar Singh was iniquitous to your mother. But that was a mistake in the state of.. "Drunkenness, unconsciousness. But this monster has shot your mother and.. ...killed her in front of me! If you wish to seek revenge for your mother then kill him! Kill him! Mother! Take the name of the lord.. Oh God! No! Shankar dear.. Son, come.. come close to me. Even after being shot with so many bullets.. ...l have a few breaths left. Come. Come and.. shoot me, son. Or else.. your mother's soul won't rest in peace. Seek your revenge, son. Seek it. Tell him, Padmini. Tell him to take my last breath away. No, father. My hatred has lost in front of your repentance, father. Father. You have washed off all your sins with your pureness. Father.. I got my mother, father. I got my mother. Son.. My son. Look he is calling you mother, Padmini. He is your son. He.. he.. - Father. You.. you are great, father. Now I am proud.. to be called your son.
