You're ready and sing Bless your beautiful hide. Prepare to bend your knee. And take that vow, cause I'm telling you now, you're the gal for me. Pretty and trim, but not too slim, bossy and bold, but not too-- Are we still on for Saturday? Oh, yes. Are you coming alone? Yes. You need a man. Bless your beautiful hide-- Hmm. Well, I had one. I told you. Mmm. Thought I had one. Well, get another one. OK, cut. Let's take it back over on page four. Skip on over You can have mine. No, thank you. Bless your beautiful hide-- Oh, no, no, no I didn't mean it like that, Nancy. No, I like Chuck. Don't worry, I wouldn't wish him on you. He has very unpleasant personal habits. Oh, I'd swap my gun 'n' I'd swap-- Really? my mule, Tho' whoever took it would be-- Cut. Miss Davis. - Yes, sir? When did, when did you get this music, hon? Last night, after teachers' meeting. Sure it wasn't this morning? Well, it's possible that I didn't have time to practice it after last night's meeting. Uh, It is written for both hands, left and right? I will chord. I told you when you asked me to help you out that I couldn't play the piano that well and I can maybe give him a chord. - OK. - Will that be all right, Frank? - Let's try that, OK? - OK Like a little bit more support. Let's take that intro. You got the intro-- Chuck has invited some boy over for Saturday. Uh-huh It's Burt Reynolds Hey, uh, maybe you haven't noticed yet, flapping your mouth here, but you're burning those steaks. Well, I couldn't notice from hearing. Not that they don't need it. No, these are not burnt. I know about these steaks. Look at that. Prime! That one there can-- That's yours. I wouldn't feed that to my dog. Guess who's gonna eat it? In fact, that looks a lot like my dog. Where did get this [INAUDIBLE] You're gonna have the, uh-- You don't know anything about this. Food and Drug Administration out here. - Obviously. - Chuck. - Hi. - Great! Thank you. Obviously somebody around here knows what's going on. But I'm not getting any help from this turkey. Larry, Kathleen. Don't hold it against her that she's a Yankee. Nice to meet you. Why don't you look after her and I'll take care of this stuff right here. Let's get out of here while the gettin's good. How long you been down in Texas? And Reagan's been groomed. He's been groomed for the presidency. Ever since he made that Goldwater speech. Well, he's got a believable face. Such a-- He's got class. I think they really got a lot of class, don't you? --and this I like. You work with Chuck. Yeah, we work together downtown. Law offices down there. You're a teacher, though, you said. With Nancy Oh, yeah, yeah. Skyline High School. Let me ask you a little historical question, then, all right? - Yeah A little quiz here. OK - Who do the following people have in common? Uh, Texas Rangers, outlaws cowboys, Indians, cattle barons, marshals sheriffs, bad guys, saloon keepers. Who have they got in common? Who do they have in common? This guy is as famous as anybody in the whole history of the West, or the country for that matter. I don't know You're a teacher? And you don't know? A history teacher? You don't know? Well, tell me. Samuel Colt. The gunman. Right, of course. Colt revolvers. Sure. Texas Rangers down here were issued Colts in the 1830s. 40-caliber, nine-inch, five-shot Colt revolver and then, do you know about the, uh, Colt single action 45, 1873 it was called? I don't know anything about guns. The Equalizer? The Peacemaker? The gun that won the West? I never heard of it You can't possibly begin to understand history down here unless you know something about Colt revolvers. How come you come to know so much? They teach you this at law school? I collect antique guns. Good. Yeah. know something? Your kids can learn a whole lot of history from just one of my old guns, I'll bet ya. I mean, it's always been the case that the guy who had the best weapon was the guy who changed the course of history. Hey, you have something there. Would you teach them? I mean, would you come to one of my classes, maybe? You know, just bring a couple of your old guns, you know. Talk to them about the Old West. You think they'd be interested in that? I know they'd love it. Well, you got yourself a deal, lady. Oh, wow! This takes me back. What? This takes me back. Yeah. Who are the [INAUDIBLE] We are the [INAUDIBLE] Now, Samuel Colt's first revolver was this 1836 Texas Patterson, 40-caliber, 9-inch barrel. And it was a single action, which means when I cock it, like that, trigger drops down and you're ready to go. Now, this as an improvement on the single shot, sort of, musket type gun is just inestimable because what it meant was that you had five shots right away and there goes five Indians, right? OK, so now we get to the gun that I've been waiting for, it's my favorite and the favorite of most collectors. It's the gun that won the West. That's it, that's the Colt six shooter. You know, you've all seen it in the movies. And it's very different from the guns that we've seen already in that it takes a, uh, metallic, self-exploding cartridge, (i.e. a bullet). OK, now this has a four and 3/4-inch barre. That was the smallest barrel that was used and that was because of the necessity of having a quick draw. You know, which, excuse me, which you've all seen. Now, that just meant that you were clearing your holster a little bit more quickly. And you might have heard of Wyatt Earp, Dodge City Sheriff. Uh, he had an 11-inch barrel, a special one that was made by Ned Buntline for him. And he used that for accuracy and he swore that with that 11-inch barrel he was just as quick as anybody else. And he did a pretty decent job of proving it, I might add. Now this basic gun was known as The Peacemaker. Kind of tended to subtle arguments. The Equalizer, uh, Judge Colt and His Jury of Six. It was really, uh, very important for us in the, uh, in the history of the Old West, and in the history of Texas. And, actually, this gun is not very much different than the kind of gun you'll see on any Dallas patrolman today. Hope not too many of you get a chance to look at that up close, but-- I guess you'd have to say that Samuel Colt's influence is incredible when you think that the policemen are still using guns very much like these. OK, hold it. That's all we have time for, but I'm sure we'd all like to thank Mr. Keeler. OK. Mr. Keeler, will you be coming back to see us? Well, I sure would like to. I'm sure Mr. Keeler is very busy, Tonda, we'll have to see. OK, go ahead. That was really, really good. Thank you very much. I enjoyed it. I really appreciate it. How 'bout having dinner with me tonight. Hey, Ms. Sullivan. Um, well I don't know, I'm really busy right now. I'm not. --the [INAUDIBLE] Well, how about the weekend? Bet you've never been to the Texas State Fair, have you? We get a day off for it, actually. I wanna take you. Please? Are we going to re-fight the Civil War, Kathleen? Well, all right. OK. Goin' courtin', goin' courtin'. If you find it hard to break the ice, goin' courtin', goin' courtin'. Here's a little feminine advice. Roll your eyes and heave a little sigh. Grunt and groan like you're about to die. That is what's known as emotin', goin' courtin'! And Goin' courtin' going courtin'-- Stop, let's stop right there. Oh, boy. OK, she'll sing. The next line is "You cuddle up." Come on, Nancy. Yeah, "You cuddle up," she moves away. OK? OK. You got that real good? All right, then the strategy comes into play. OK? Once again from beginning? Yes. - OK. Well, like this, Millie? You gotta wait for it, Caleb. There's lots of things you got to know. Be sure the parlor light is low. You sidle up and squeeze her hand. Let me tell you fellas, that it's grand. Howdy, folks. Welcome to the state fair of Texas. So now we're goin' with the up, round, flip it over and around, get a flat span. Put a triple up in the air, bring it up and then shoot it up over and around, and catch it under the leg, over the shoulder and fire it up around and make it flip up in the air, back down in your hand. Work it over here [INAUDIBLE] Sometimes you get a flat span to where it'll jump up in the air and work it over. And back into it. Uh, ladies and gentlemen, there ain't no place like Texas. Now there's what it's all about, there. What do you shoot with this thing, anyway? Anything you want. Here. Take one of these. Put Ketamine in it. Is that right? And, like I said, it'll bring down anything you like: tigers, elephants, cattle, anything. - Anything, huh? - Right. Here I am. Hey, I wondered what happened to you. Never been this close to a gun. This is just to put animals to sleep with, nothing to get excited about. John, thanks a lot. - You bet. Have a nice day now. Let's go looks at the sheep. So how was it? It was OK. I told him I was getting over somebody else and I didn't want to get involved. Didn't want to get involved? Who said he wants to get involved? You know what he wants. Well he's going to be disappointed. And I wouldn't mind going out with him occasionally and having a good time. There's nothing wrong with that, is there? Well, obviously there is. I didn't say a word. Oh, look. Hi, Noreen, hi. How you doing? Hi, baby. Hello? - Hello? - Mom! - Hi! - Hi! How are you? Very good, and yourself? - I'm really fine. - Yeah? What a surprise! Yeah, I got your letter. Oh, good. But I figured we would surprise you with a call. - Oh, God, this is really nice. - Yeah. Hold on, let me get, let me get more comfortable. Hold on. - Yeah. Oh, wow! How are things? Really fine. Good good. How do you like it down there? - Good. The school is immense. I've made friends with one of the teachers here. Oh that's nice. And I got to her house every now and then. - Oh, that's good. - Yeah. Like family, like you know feel more at home. Mhm. It makes a big difference. And, uh, this Satur-- this past Saturday I went to, uh, the state fair with a friend of theirs. Yeah? Male or female? He's a man I see. Don't go jumping to conclusions. Well, I have to keep tabs on you a little bit, even you're far away. - Yeah. Yeah. Nothing serious. - Nothing serious? - No, no. - OK, OK. - No. OK. What does he work at? Um, he's an attorney. Oh, very nice. You're in-- - Yeah. - Very good. You're in with the right kind of people, it seems. He seems to think so. - Oh, he does, huh? - Yeah. - Thinks a lot of himself? - Yes. Oh. Ha!

Um, I've been going to mass. - Oh, my God. - What? Miracles will never cease. She's going to mass. Oh, God. Oh, that's good. Yeah, well, my mom says that's good. Well, that is. I knew, I knew it would make you happy. Yes, yes, there's no question [INAUDIBLE] of that. But, you know, when you are a little lax while you were away in college. Yeah. All I can say is it, it makes us feel so happy that you're, sound so contented and, you know, eh, well, it may sound a little choked up now, but you're a good girl and, and, and just keep up the, you know, the way you were brought up and that's all, then we'll have nothing to worry about. OK, love? So listen, you're always in our thoughts, and we love you - Ohh. - Very, very much. Oh, I love you too, daddy. Give us a call whenever you get a chance or drop us a line. OK, yes. - OK. - OK Excellent. So I'll be talking to you again soon. - Oh, God bless you. - OK. Sleep good, OK? Good night, darling. Bye-bye. Bye, love. Bye. Good to hear her voice, wasn't it? Oh, good God, yes. Yeah, well we never had to worry about her, so we won't-- Unfortunately, yes. That's true. Yeah, yeah. We won't worry. - Well, it's great-- - OK, so she's all right. - Yeah - OK Nancy tells me you're seeing a little bit of Kathleen. Now, you know me, Chuck. Always a gentleman. Give a lady a little time and she'll blossom like a flower. Mm. Good to go. Dan-- - Taking off? Congratulations, I'm sorry I can't make it tomorrow. - Oh, that's all right. - Larry, see you later. Take care. Take care of my man here, huh? Sue, can I have a drink? Coming up with your tequila. Tequila? Come on, you only get married once, so [INAUDIBLE] All right. You'll be thankful-- - One more drink. - Yeah. It'll be all right. Those special occasions. Can't drink that stuff. OK OK, A little salt. You know how to do that. There you go. He looks kind of experienced. I seen it, and I seen it in the commercials. Yeah, seen it. Down at, down at, down at the first Baptist church-- Oh, my! And isn't she pretty, huh? Yeah! That's our pretty poison. But we've got a challenger. Sit on my face. We have got a challenger. Referee, let's bring up Sweet Cherie Amour. All right! Sweet Cherie! All right. Is there any fella out there who wants to help a little lady in here? Ladies go get yourself a manager. Let's wait till we get into the ring, ladies. This is a grudge match. These girls don't like each other. They're wanting to pull away a championship and you're going to help them do it. Can I hear from the marijuana section? I knew you were out there somewhere. All right, they look like they're about ready. We're going to put them in the ring. Referee, where are you? Right here. We're ready to get Foxy Boxing underway! Round one. All right, separate corners. Sixty seconds, round one action, underway! Both ladies show up to center ring. Heavy boxing action, underway! Cherie, up against the ropes. Misty Fordson giving her a taste of what Poison is all about. They're tangled up. Pull those ladies apart. All right! All right, more action on the way. Poison, up against the ropes. She says, no way, I'm coming back. Right away [INAUDIBLE]. Getting a taste of the action. [INAUDIBLE] Trying to find a way Sweet Cherie! [INAUDIBLE] And we're counting down. Eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. All right! Oh, yes, indeed. Foxy Boxing. - All set? - Uh-huh. Have you been busy? Yeah, I've been up late almost every night with some trying cases lately. We'll take turns, OK? Sure. I'll go first. Old movie stars. Well, that's easy, John Wayne. Why? At least he was a real man. I mean, better than the faggots you see in the movies these days. And you? Alan Ladd. Why? Haven't you seen Shane on TV? I mean, he didn't want to fight anymore, but he could if he had to. He looked so sad and lonely. Such nice eyes. Look at that. You have a nice body, you know? Nothing wrong with that. I mean, you shouldn't be ashamed of that. You have a nice body. I'll tell you what's real special about Texas, and that is this is still a frontier. And what I mean by that is that on the frontier, in the olden days in the West, on a day-to-day basis, people had to draw upon their courage and their resources, their inner resources, in order to just exist from day-to-day, to just live. In the last 10 years, or so, there's been this tremendous build up in government-supported welfare type programs. I think it's wrong. I think it's contrary to the frontier spirit. I think it causes people to lose their self-respect. And I think it's something that we in Texas have been really loath to accept and we've kind of stayed away from. If I'm living in New York City, I ought to be on welfare. I'm going to make as much money as I would working. You sound just like my father. Uh, he must be a very fine man. He's an anachronism. My sister Mary Ellen, she calls him a beached male, not to his face. He's very strict with us girls. I would have been, too. Would you like to have some dessert? Kathleen. Madame? Um-mm, I'll take that piece. Make me come, come along with you, baby. Make me come, come along with you, baby. Take me home tonight darlin' Just too strong where the feelin's right It's too intense to keep on tryin' to fight tryin' You gotta make me come, Come along with you Make me feel for you tonight, baby, Make me real for you tonight, baby. Take me down with you tonight. I can't wait to take a little chance. Let's get out of here-- You just continue going on straight down there. It's all right. Well, I'm gonna take you right home, just where I picked you up. I mean,do what do you think this is? Some type of second class operation here? What a night, huh? Larry, I had a really good time. Oh, it was wonderful. You're a good dancer, you know? - Why, are you surprised? - No, no, not a bit. Good dancer yourself. Thank you, thank you. I think we danced well together. Hey, I should at least walk you in. Um, It's not necessary, really. Kathleen This is a safe neighborhood. I thought you'd at least ask me in for a cup of coffee to get home on. - You did? Well, uh, it's, it's late and, um, if I don't get a good night's sleep I'll be a wreck tomorrow morning. You know? OK, bye. Hello Kathleen, it's Larry. Larry, hi. How are you? What are you doing? Uh, I was just out the door to mass, actually when you called. What are you doing after? Uh, well, well I'm going to be busy, actually. I have some, uh papers to look over and, uh, just getting ready for the weekend in general, you know. Kathleen, do something for me, please. It's really kind of special and I'd appreciate it. What? Come straight over here after church. I'm sure you haven't eaten and I have something really special I want to share. Well, what is it? I'm not saying any more. Please say you'll come. I'm going to be real hurt if you don't. I want it all to be a surprise. Please? Well, all right. I'll come. You've obviously got something up your sleeve. Great. You won't regret it. Amazing grace, how sweet the sound Gives the fake, now the Cowboys have a third down and six and the shotgun formation in effect [INAUDIBLE] the Rams. Motion from Butch Johnson. Snap is back. White retreats, goes right side. Mann is open, caught. Jay Saldi, up at the 37, first down. Twelve yard gain. PRIEST 1: Christ, Amen. Body of Christ. Amen. Priest 2: Blood of Christ. Blood of Christ. Amen. PRIEST 1: Body of Christ. PARISHIONER: Amen. He's at the 25, he's at the 10. Hills throws and touchdown. A pass of 63 yards. You've just eaten the finest venison steak that can be had anywhere. Downed by me yesterday, down near Laredo. A deer? Was great, wasn't it? Oh, no. Now, you just said how good it was. I know, it was good. Well, I'm glad you told me now because if ya told me before I probably wouldn't have eaten it. Listen, I've got some fresh fruit and I've got some nice Camembert just [INAUDIBLE]. Would you like little a cheese, maybe? - No, no that's not necessary. - You sure? Yea, I've had plenty. Well, why don't we just move on over here make ourselves comfortable and finish our wine maybe listen to a little music. All right. OK. This is yours. And that's mine. And this is ours. Here's to a new culinary experience for you. Venison. OK. You know, this thing of hunting and having venison to eat is a really special thing for me. And, it's something that I, uh, well, I often, in fact, do by myself just because it's so special. I'm just really happy that you were able to come over and enjoy it with me. And I'd like to think that it, is a way, maybe I'm not too good at phrasing things, uh-- Well, that's not necessary. --directly. Well, I just want to tell you, it's really a special experience for me and I wanted to show you somehow that you're really special to me. Oh. And I don't know how to do that because sometimes you seem kind of standoffish, you know? - I do? Yeah. Oh, I don't mean to. - Really? I mean, it's like, it's almost like you're afraid of something. It's like, you're so warm and you're so, so giving and open and friendly and I see it with the kids. And you're so sensitive, you know, to their feelings and needs and you're so open to them. And I feel you being that way with me sometimes and then it's like you catch yourself, or something. And you just, wham! Down comes the, down comes the wall. It's like you're afraid of something. I mean, obviously, you couldn't be afraid of me, but it's just It's not, not afraid. It's like you're afraid of something in yourself, or? No, no no, not at all. It's just, like I told you before, you know, I don't really want to get involved with anyone right now. That's all it is. It's very simple. I just wish there was some way for me to communicate to you, or express to you how special you are to me. Oh, but you have. I mean, not just today. You've been very kind. Well, I'd like to be a little more than kind, lady, I think. Larry. Please, stop. Larry? Larry. Larry! Let me, let me go, OK? Larry? Please don't. Let me go. Larry! Let me, let me up. What's wrong with you? Piss off! What're you acting like that for? - Let me go. - No! What're you acting like that for? Why do you think? I'm going now. No! Stop it! Stop it! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Stop it! Stop! Stop! Help! Help! Take it easy, understand? Help! Help! Stop it! No! No! No! No! Put it away! - Shut up! It's not pointed at you. [SOBBING AND SCREAMING] - Quiet! Shut up! There were one-hundred and ninety-eight accidental handgun deaths in Dallas last year. Not one of them was successfully prosecuted. They were all caused by people who weren't familiar with handguns and that's you. None of them were caused by somebody familiar with handguns, and that's me. Kathleen, I'm not pointing it at you. Now, shut up! Let's go in the bedroom. No! I'm not pointing it at you. You have, you're a very passionate young lady because you are removed from any responsibility whatsoever for your actions, as long as you're here. Now, just relax. Just relax. You have no choice, no responsibility. So, just relax. All right? Why don't go over there and get undressed. Come one, just go on and get undressed. Just get undressed, Kathleen. Take your time. I can't. Nothing you can do about it. Just get undressed. That's it. Just relax. Just relax. Please, stop, Larry. Just relax. No. [INAUDIBLE] Just relax. Oh, God. Just relax. Just relax, honey. I just want to make love to you. It's nothing terrible. It's going to be OK. Just relax now. It's OK. I'm really sorry things got a little out of hand back there. But it's, it's partly your own fault, you know, for being so irresistible. I guess I shouldn't have scared you like that. I'm sorry. You know, uh, you should at least consider the possibility of maybe getting professional help. I mean, you're so repressed sexually. And there's no reason for that because you're a wonderful, warm, sensitive, sensual person and you just kind of shut it off. I mean you really should at least, you must have been traumatized at some point when you were young into feeling just incredibly guilty about sex and sex is just part of your life. I wish there was some way, some trigger to release the sort of sexual repression that you have. The sort of psychical freeze that you have on your sensuality because it's clearly something in your psyche that's just slightly maladjusted. I'd like to help you with that, I mean I'd like to share it with you, talk to you about it. Do you have any sexual fantasies, maybe? May I go now, please? Let's just try this once more. This time's just for you. Kathleen, hi. What are you doing? It's not morning yet, is it? Hey, you're welcome to stay here. You're being such a [INAUDIBLE] No, I've gotta go. I saved you some fresh fruit for breakfast. No, thanks. It's real good. - I don't want any. - You sure? Yeah. Suit yourself. Drive safely now. Here you go, Harold. Hi, can I help you? There's things that I need to find out if we're going to do anything to this guy. I'm going to have to ask you some questions, I'm afraid, but I'll try to make it as painless as I possibly can, all right? OK And afterwards I'll take you down to the hospital and we'll let the doc check you and make sure you're OK. OK? I know my way to the hospital. I can drive myself. Well, I'd really prefer to drive you, if you don't mind. You don't have to go through that trouble. Really, I'm fine now. Kathleen, I'm afraid that for the next few hours you are walking evidence and it's my job to protect it. Spread your knees out now. Just relax. Nice and easy. OK. Doin' all right? Kathleen, this is Sue James's number at the rape crisis center. She's good people and she'll take care of it. And you know where we are. Sure. Take care. SKYLINE HIGH SCHOOL Hello, um, this is Kathleen Sullivan. Uh, I'm calling in sick today. Um, I have a stomach virus. I should be in tomorrow. Tuesday morning? - Yes. - OK, take care. Thank you. This, this is a situation in which you're going to do yourself, your soul, your whole life, grave harm and even toying with any idea of vengeance. And what, what you have to do yes, in time, I, I'm not saying this right now, but what you have to remind yourself in a panicked moment is that there is a Providence behind what's going on and this man is in serious trouble spiritually, emotionally, and he's going to be in great legal trouble. What you have to do, in time, is to forgive him, pray for him, Kathleen, it's, it's hard, I know it's hard. I'm, again, saying give yourself time, but in a troubled moment it's easy to panic and forget anything that you ever learned, anything that's ever been important to you and, and your that's a time when you can destroy yourself, your soul if you're not careful. I want him punished! That's, again that's up to God. That's up to God. And if, that's not, that's not our role to punish people. Christ' whole life is that, is that we, we have, we have to pray for people in trouble. Now that, again, is going to take you time. But you don't know what kind of punishment he might already be going through right now. You're shaken by it, if the man has any heart, I mean you were attracted to him, weren't you? Wasn't there something attractive about the man? OK, so there is a possibility that you might be pregnant --something like this. Kathleen, just try to be realistic about it. Again, the question of your faith. Believing that, that children are are just these little wonderful miracles and miracles happen because of God. So even at the, the darkest if that's what's happened. You-- - I've been to the hospital. Already taken care of that, thank you. I know. It was just amazing. It held its body. Are you want this all cut off? Yes. OK. How short did you want this? But I think we have to look at the idea that it's just an opportunity-- we've got to take advantage-- - Good morning, coach. Good morning. So how's it going? Pretty well. My last class is the type that laughs every time I say the word organism. You seem-- Kathleen? Kathleen. When did you cut your hair? Yesterday. - You OK? - I'm fine. How are you? You have some bad news? No. Are you folks OK? - How are you, Jim? - I'm fine. Kathleen, it looks good. It really does. It's cute. It's suits you. It really is. You're-- Take care, huh. You'll get used to it. Kathleen! Oh, my God! She looks terrible. What happened to her head? Looks like those Indians we were talking gotta hold of her. Pretty sexy, huh? Yeah, it is but it looked better before. Back when it was long, sexy. Did I ask for your opinion? Keep it to yourself, Mr. Neil. Same goes for you, too. Tonda, sick of this late business. You saunter in here as though you're coming to a nightclub. I'm sorry. I'm just light. Get the gum out of your mouth. I just put it in. Get it out. If you have any problems, you know who's office you can go to. What's it going to be? It's gone out. Turn to page 126. What were the four cattle trails running through Texas? You. In west Texas? Any part of Texas. Um, Goodnight-Loving. Do you have gum in your mouth? Yes, ma'am. Get it out. That goes for anybody else in here. Glad you got Mike Stone on that thing. Got it squared right away. Yeah, Stoney's a good man. Best you got. Yaleies Yeah, you Yaleies are surprising me. I hear you're still seeing Kathleen. Make any progress? Gentleman never discusses details of his sex life, Chuck. Even you ought to know that. Wouldn't be fair to the girl. Thank you. Old love'em and leave'em Larry, huh? Well, it's better than not loving them at all, like you old, married men. It's not that I don't believe, Kathleen, I do, and it's up to you to pursue this if you want to. Juries are funny animals, but we can't take it to them. There's no real evidence. All we have is your word and the fact that intercourse did take place. But you admit that you were not a virgin before all this started. You'd been out with this guy on dates before, you went voluntarily to his apartment at night where he cooked you a meal and you shared a bottle of wine together. You said that you screamed and struggled, but he lives in the middle of an apartment complex and nobody heard anything. You spent six hours with him, you had intercourse twice. He even asked you to spend the rest of the night with him, but then he didn't prevent you from leaving. This guy is a respectable, professional man with no criminal record. Look, Kathleen, even if you did get it into court the defense would rip you to pieces. They'd start out by ridiculing you, a girl whose been scorned after a one night stand. Promiscuous. Before they were finished, they'd be calling you a whore. Are you ready for that? I didn't have to come over here and tell you all this, Kathleen, but you're a nice girl and I just really don't think you know what you're letting yourself in for. Take care. Hello? Hello? Hello, Kathleen, it's Larry. Listen, I noticed you left your, uh, shawl over my house. I thought I'd give you a call, see if I can get it back to you. I'd be happy to meet up with you later, bring it over. Anywhere you like. Or maybe later on in the week we could have dinner and I could, uh, bring it then. If that's easier for you. The real West wasn't where, or when, it was who. It was people. Real people. At one time, one out of every 100 Americans was involved in the opening of the West. There was glory in what they did. Just in getting there there was glory, but there was tragedy, too. Because someone was there first. Lights. As far as that man was concerned, we were all illegal aliens. We'll take that tragedy up in the next lesson. There was more Indian, Mexican and European bloodshed in Texas than in any other place. The casualties were terrible, rape, pillage, and murder. And Texas was not settled. It was fought over and finally conquered in a race war. Remember what Mr. Keeler told you, the man with the old revolvers, how important guns were to our history. That old Indian chief knew it, and you should know it. When we as a people won our independence, with guns, preserved the union with guns, settled strikes with guns, and even now we think that we can protect ourselves with guns. We solve all of our problems with guns. Preserve peace with more guns. As a nation, we're in love with guns. Hey, Kathleen, could you take over rehearsal tonight? Nancy, I'm busy. Oh shoot, I knew the minute you'd get a man I'd lose you. What did you say? Well, you and Larry. What about me and Larry? Nothing, I mean I know you-- What has he said? Nothing. We just assumed. You just assumed! Hey, I'm sorry. Does that feel comfortable to you? - No. - OK. Let's split it one more time. OK? Load two more. Hey, how you guys? Hey, Larry, how you doing? Hey, you should've been out here about an hour ago, you missed it. What I missed something? We got a new member. A real cute one. You ought to check her out, she's a real cutie. Is that right? You've never seen Masterson move in on something so fast in your life. Man, we've had women before. She'll never make it. They come and go. Well, I hope this one stays. I'll go check her out. - Sounds Good. Go down there and check it out. She's down on the end with the plaid shirt with Masterson. Walk down there and see what you think. I might have to have a look at that after all. Take care. Take it easy. Kathleen. Kathleen. Kathleen. Kathleen, are you trying to kill someone out here today? Remember what I told you, keep the gun pointed down range at all times. Don't ever point it at anything you don't want to kill. Hey, Larry do you know that girl? Ah, thought I did, but it turned out to be somebody else. Oh. Where can I get a gun? You want a new gun? God, guts and guns, have made our country strong. Now they're trying to take them all away. Yes, God, guts and guns, gonna keep our country strong. I hope I never live to see the day. Uh, tell me senator, what would you do if you came home tonight and found the bird was stole, the stereo, killed your kids and raped your wife? Would you tell them master, no, no, and slap him on the wrist and say that's not nice to do? Or grab your twelve gauge shotgun and blow him clean in two. Here's a basic 45 automatic. It holds seven in the magazine, one in chamber. We have a total of eight shells. Single action. It's a good, little weapon. Yeah, I was wanting one just for my own personal use. I didn't really, you know, wanna, but we're not allowed to carry them on duty. Boy, these are tight. - Hello, Ray. Bill, how are you? Glad to see you. - Fine, how about you? - Fine Doing all right? Fine, thank you. Good. Ray, this is Kathleen. She's a-- - Kathleen - --new member of our club. - Hi - She's looking to buy a gun. Very glad to meet you. I told her you could help us out. Bill, you have any idea what she might like, or what do you think? Revolver, automatic, uh? I've been shooting a Diamondback. Revolver, that's good. And I think I'd like something a little heavier. Yeah, I'd highly recommend that Python, the Colt Python is basically the same gun, just a little bit bigger like father son and let me, let me get one for you, just a moment. - It's the, uh-- That sounds better. Yes, it's the Cadillac of the Colt revolver line, the Python is. Same idea. Same family as the Diamond and it works the same way. So you don't have any problem-- - It is. This is a really good feel. Just hard to beat. - Does it feel good to ya? - I like the weight. Do you like the weight of it, uh? A lot. It's quite a bit heavier than the Diamondback was, so therefore we control the recoil a little better. Bill, let me show, uh, Kathleen the one with the rubber grip on it. - The rubber-- You'd even like it even better than that. The rubber Pachmayrs. Yes, I think so-- - Just a minute. - That's a good idea. - Like yours. Yes, like my service revolver that we've been shooting. I think you'd even like this better. Well, the thing of it is with the rubber grips down south here your hands get sweaty in the summer and, uh, the gun's not slick, whereas wooden grips like that, they get slick in your hands. How did that grip feel? Mm. It's like it's not even there, it's oh, God. Mhm. Now, How'd it feel, Kathleen? It feels really good. And even in the wintertime, it's much better grippin', you know when it's cold, you know, not only summer, but winter. I like this. Beautiful way of doing it. How much is this? Oh, 185 dollars. I know, that's expensive, but it's the perfect way of doing it. And I can just come in here and buy this? Mhm. Do you, uh, you live in Texas? Yeah. You do? You're in a new world, this is a free country down here, uh, Kathleen. Kathleen, where you from? Where's your home state? I mean-- - Boston. Oh! No wonder. Oh, down here, long as you live in the state you can buy the weapon. No problem. - Mm. We're gonna make a Texan out of her, though. Good, good. You like that, Kathleen? This is the one I want. Oh, yes, we have, uh, very liberal gun laws down here and they don't seem to cause any problems, Kathleen. So, I don't see what the uproar is about trying to make them more strict. That gun's not gonna commit any crimes. What'd you think about the store? Hmm. Never seen anything like it. Nothing like it in Boston? No. Not that I've seen, anyway. It's unbelievable. It is. He's built up a fabulous operation there over the years. You have time to go out to the range with me? Yes, uh, sure do. Be glad to. Enjoy it. Dump the empty brass out, like we've been taught. When you dumped them before you came to this position. Good, but you kept it like this. At that point, gravity won't let the empty hulls fall out. They could hang in between your grip and jam up your weapon. Need to turn your gun over a little bit more. Get your speed loader out, arm extended, line up two and then the the rest of'em will fall right on in. Now, just, then, push it on in. Don't try to pick the speed loader up. Just kind of whack it off. There. Ready on right, ready on left. How'd I do? 10 seconds. Very good. Terrific. That's terrific. OK, Kathleen, this is close-in drill from Zone Two. You will go on my command, OK? Gun! Very good. Did you see that? The important thing is, I'm gonna tuck this shoulder under and tuck my head in, so watch, OK? OK, Kathleen? 'Member, sight picture, sight picture, sight picture, then squeeze as it's in there. And just think about making it go off and it will go off. A very gentle pull, right-- sight. Very good! You got yourself an X that time. Not too bad, is it? - No. Damn, you're doing great. I wish I could get my wife to do that good. I could tell when you were talking through it. I could tell the difference. Yes, uh, you see that X you got in there? - Mm-hmm - That's very good. That's because you were concentrating on what you were doing. Remember that any time you're under a stress condition or a combat condition, the guy that stays calm is the one that wins. I watched that Vietnam many, many times. - You were there? - Oh, yeah. But when you've got somebody pulling down on you, take your time, get your principles down. He will probably blow his first shot. If he doesn't, didn't make any difference, anyway. You don't usually become that lucky. OK, Kathleen, this time I want you to Mozambique the target. What? Mozambique the target. Two in the body, one in the head, that way you'll make sure he's really dead. On my command, go. Gun. - I would take a sandwich. - Yeah. Hear you, boy. Let's eat, I'm hungry. We made it all right, didn't we? Yup. All right. Uh, what he carried to the Alamo we don't know, maybe a slight modification to this, but this is the type of knife that Bowie actually became famous with and carried into the Texas area. From that point-- Can I pick it up? Sure. The knives really became more of a killing and deadly weapon. They created a clip point to it and sharpened the top edge. And this knife was used with what they call a hammer grip. The knife was generally held just like you'd hold a hammer to drive nails with and was used at very close quarters. You would get close to your opponent, use your other hand as a defensive hand or to grab a hold of him, if you could, to draw him into you and with the weight of the knife and the length, an upward puncturing stroke would slash completely up the chest area and through the bone, or at a deflected angle, through the heart it made a very massive and deadly immediate killing wound. But the popularity of the big Bowie knives have stayed with us even today. This is a shortened version of a modern knife with a Bowie blade on it. Makes an ideal hunting type knife or a camping type knife and realistically it can be used as a very good survival type knife. What do mean? This is going to be a valuable weapon to have in the next few years, as a survival knife. What do mean survival? Well, when the break down, when the collapse comes. - What are you talking about? - It's gonna happen. You know, I was watching you the other morning on the shooting range. You're getting to be real good. Ah, thank you. I don't know, particularly, why you're wanting to learn how to use a gun, but let me tell ya in two, three years, you're going have to use that gun. This is going to come in handy. Because our social society, as it is now, is going to, is going to break some point. Our c-- our nation, our country's weak right now. You know, a lot of people think that, uh, you know, the government is going to be able to step in and help when we need it. You know, like they did during the 30s. The government's not gonna be able to help. What do you think is going to happen when the federal government can't pay off welfare checks anymore? Every black and Mexican in this city is going to start rioting. Now, if I pointed this knife at you, and you knew that I was serious about it, and I asked you for that drink there, you would give it to me. Yeah. I'll have to agree. We've been selling more combat knives and fighting type of knives in the last year, or so, to people that-- and we expect to sell many more. And this is a combat knife? That would be a survival or combat style typical of knives that are the bigger sellers in today's society. I wish you'd just open a school here as, as good an instructor as you were. You should just open a school here in Dallas for executive protection. You can teach them hand-to-hand combat. You can teach them pistol craft. It's frivolous. Sure, it's not frivolous, it's-- There's no discipline. You look around and see what's happening in the U.S. of A today - They can't survive this. The schools are doing real well. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the, uh, North Texas Pistol and Revolver Club and this morning's combat match. Safety is one of our biggest concerns out here, since we will be firing live ammunition and this is considered to be a hot range. That means that the majority of the shooters will be loaded at all times. Uh, we haven't had any accidents as, as long as we've been shooting here and, uh, We want to maintain it that way. There are some hostile and non-hostile targets out there. If you do fire on a non-hostile target you will be disqualified. Everybody I'm sure understands that safety is the first, most important thing in a match like this. All right, if there are no questions, then I'd like to have the first shooter up on line, Don Yost. Be sure and come up here to the line, Don. All right, get up in the starting position. All right, the commands I will give you will be shooter make ready, which time you will load your weapon and I will give you the command shooter ready, standby, then go. Understood? All right, shooter make ready. Our next shooter is Larry Keeler. Good luck, Larry. Good switch there. We'll see if the attorney can shoot. All right, stand easy, Larry. Thank you, Don, good going. Good round. shooter make ready. Good round, Don. All right, hands at your side. Shooter's ready. Go! Good run. You really moved down that trail. What's the time on that, Phil? Not a bad round at all. Looked like you had wings on those feet. All right, let's get to the next shooter now. The next shooter is Kathleen Sullivan. Shooter please come up on the line. Good luck, do good. There you go, Ray. Good going, Larry. Thanks, buddy. Go for it! All right, shooter make ready. All right, shooter ready? Stand by. Go! Jesus, look at her tits. Gosh, she moves just right. Wow! Look at her bounce. That's a good run, though. Damn, she shot the wrong target. She shot the wrong, the friendly target. - She had it won. - Damn. What in the world? She had it running great. Looks like she did it on purpose. Oh, too bad. She didn't hesitate much did she? Boy, now that was a real super run. Looked like she shot one of our local police officers. Well, that's too bad, looks like that will disqualify her from this run. I'm trying to find out if maybe she cared more for you, maybe her feelings got hurt. Maybe she, you know, I'm trying to find out what has changed this girl. I like her. Oh, I do too. I'm fond of her. I have a great deal of affection for her. I am concerned for her mental health right now because I think she has some kind of a psychological problem. She looks dreadful she looks to me like somebody that had something really terrible happened to her. And what I want to know is did something terrible happened to Kathleen? Not when she was with me. What happened the last date that you had? Nothing out of the ordinary. Now, wait a minute. Not your ordinary, out of her ordinary. Absolutely not. We had a very pleasant evening. She was, she walked out of there and said bye and that was it. She walked out the door and I said drive safely and I'll give you a call tomorrow. But you didn't call her tomorrow, did you? Called her Tuesday. We were tied up on that Houston case. She knows I work hard and I'm very often tied up. I want you to understand that I am not trying to play lawyer. I'm not trying to say, hey, you're the guilty culprit, you low-down, you hurt this girl. I'm trying to say that this sensitive, naive and I will use the term innocent girl. Now, wait a second. Little, vulnerable Kathleen went through a combat course where she killed seven silhouette targets, including jumping over hurdles, shooting left-handed speed reloading a 357 Magnum revolver. And, in the end, in fact, she blew away the friendly figure target that-- like that. Kathleen? That's not somebody I consider to be innocent or naive. That's somebody who's a killer. Then they were talking about somebody that is either very disturbed or somebody that fooled us all completely. Hello. Hello, I can't hear you. And I'm gonna hang up. Hi. I'm sorry I'm late. I took'em to the airport. Well, it's just good to see ya. Good to see you. Why don't you have a seat over there. OK. You're not that late, anyway. Hasn't been too long. Excuse me a second. Hello. Hi. It's Kathleen. Oh, hi, Kathleen. How ya doin'? I'm not feeling very well. I needed to call you. Why? What's the matter? I don't know. I've been going through a terrible time. You must've thought I'd gone crazy. Larry, I feel kind of dizzy, sort of weak. I don't know what it is. Well, hey, take it easy. What can I do to help you? Do you want a doctor? I want you, Larry. I want you to come and get me. I don't think I can make it back on my own. Sure, where are ya? I'm at the gun club. You're at the range? What the hell are you doing at the range this time of night? I don't know. Ah, um, it's, it's just as though I'm just waking up from something. I feel so funny. Please, help me. - Sure. I need you. Sure, sure. Look, don't worry. Don't do anything silly. I'll be right there. OK. Just sit still and, Kathleen, everything's gonna be just fine, OK? OK? - OK. - OK. I'm on my way. - Bye. Bye. I gotta go. I have a friend who's kind of freaked out. All right. And I'll be back real soon, so just make yourself at home. OK. And I'll see you in about an hour. OK? - OK. Turn around and kneel. Kneel. If I pull this trigger a fraction of an inch, you're dead. That's all it takes. Aren't guns fun, Larry? Everyone should have one, the we could all play. Come on, relax. This is no time to be inhibited. Remember, you have no responsibility for your actions. Doing my very best to make sure you enjoy this. You're gonna really love it, once I get you going. One of us is going to die tonight. Let's shoot it out. Isn't that the way to right a wrong? Isn't that what your believe? I'm sorry. Do you hear me? I'm sorry. Just give me a chance to explain, will ya? My life's-- No way to explain rape, Larry. A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do, isn't that it? I'd come out of there if I were you. You're a sitting duck. Who're you going to be? John Wayne? Be Jack Palance, so I can be Alan Ladd, huh? I always liked him. That's your six! Morning, I'm Dr. Portillo. You've lost a little blood. Clean room, no problem. Lucky, or someone with careful. It was the one in your stomach that had a puzzled. Weird. You've been shot with a tranquilizer gun. The drug was Ketamine. Used on big game? Been on safari, big boy? No? Somebody had a sense of humor. Want to tell me about it. There's a policeman outside and the news. They're the inquisitive type. Me? I'm just nosey. I'll read about it in the newspaper. Now see what you get when you shoot so low. Once you see it's bad, you must say no, no. When you can not sleep, you must ask yourself what for. See what it is, you can ask no more. Lay down your arms, Whoa, Lay down your arms, and I will open mine. Lay down your arms, lay down your arms, and I will open mine. You see love is not a sin give in, give in love is not a sin, give in, give in, love is not a sin, give in, give in give in give in to love Oh, lay down, your arms, whoa, lay down your arms, and I will open mine Oh, don't close your eyes, Whoa, Please don't close your eyes don't close eyes and I can open mine lay down your arms lay down your arms and I will open mine lay down your arms lay down your arms and I will open mine lay down your arms lay down your arms and I will open mine lay down
