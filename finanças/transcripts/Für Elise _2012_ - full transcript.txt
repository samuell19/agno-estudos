Elise, tell me if you have problems. But I have good marks. - I was always good. - Elise, that's not the point. I know you. I know, that you're a good student. Elise, tell your mother, that she can always come. Yes... She has a lot on her plate. She has to put in many extra hours recently. On-call duty and so on. Elise, it's in your own interest. Yes, I know. I'll tell her. "Rent invoice - final notice" Go, get inside! Such a leased car is - oah! - super cramped. So? You didn't tell me yesterday, that it'd get this late. - Better later than never. - That's right. "Tomorrow's a day too", "early bird catches the worm". "End good, all good." You'll remember the parents' meeting tonight? Yes. Sure. Damn, we'll have a major surgery this afternoon. Please, Mama. That's really important for me. Elli. I'll try my best. I understand, okay? You got another love letter. And you opened it? No, just the bills. You didn't pay the rent. - I thought I had paid it. - No. For two months now. If you don't pay it, we'll get evicted. I know. Elise, we'll go to Saaletal. Want to join us? I can't, I have something to do. - Come, the boys are coming too. - No, I really can't come. Have to study maths again? Nerd. - You're playing on my piano. - What? You're playing on my piano. Hands off! Elli, what's this? I need to study for a maths exam. I can't concentrate. - You're Elli? - Mhm. Then we'll mix you one mean Virgin-Mojito and we'll all dance! You're too stupid to dance. Okay... okay, okay. You can also just close your door. Make them leave, all of them! We're having a little party here. What's the problem? If Papa would see all this. - If, if... but he isn't, is he? You'll kick them all out of here. Immediately! Elise! That's enough. The little beast is out of her mind. Give me the bottle. Give me the bottle, you halfwit. Halfwit? Elise... I don't think this is... funny. Elise. Come in, it's cold. We'll leave soon. Morning. Want some hot chocolate? No, thanks. - Say, Mama? - Mhm? You're not in love, are you? - Maybe. - Oh God. Do you know how old he is? He could be your son! So, like my brother! Bah! Hello. Holy shit. - Slept well? - Thanks, baby! Ew! Good morning. Just wanted to give mum a kiss. I saw, looked like shit. Say, got a problem with me? No, but you can take out the trash. Please, Elise. - Eat something, Elise! - Yes! How's school, hm? Mh... it's all going quite well. Just in maths, I need to put in some more work. Papa always said, who's not good in maths, won't do well in life. But apart from that just As and Bs. Oh, wow, that's amazing! And the piano? Are you practicing well? Of course. Just someone needs to come and tune it again. You could practice here too. You could play on this wonderful piano every day. - Isn't that right, Helga? - Yes, of course! - Do you want some more coffee? - No, thank you. Are you well, Elise? I'm good, yes. Are you too? - Och, we're well! - We're doing well, yes. Elise, and how is your mother? She's also well, very busy. How late is it, Aunt Gisela? 3:10pm. Already 3:10pm? I... I must really leave now, I forgot I still have sports today. So... then... You can visit us more often. Your father was visiting often. After all we're your great-aunts. We're your family, hm? Yes... so... Wait, wait a moment! Just for you. Thanks. I'll be in touch, yes? Bye. Mama? Mama... please! Come. I'll take you to bed, yes? - What's your business? - Leave her alone. Done with maths then, yes? Piss off! When's the bus? What bus? I said piss off. The bus with all the people. The bus with all the people who give a shit about you, Anke. - You think that's funny? - You don't? Another one too? No. Two straight vodkas. Cheers. Betty! I'll leave, I can't anymore. Give that to the owner. Tell him to call me, please. Elli? Ugh! Let me sleep! You're not sleeping. I'll... I'll... pffh! I'll take you to bed. No need. No bed for a princess! Go, climb up here! - You've been drinking. - Yes, but that's over now. Climb up here now! Oh, pfffh! Boy, you're heavy! - I can't do it. - What's happening? Listen. It's Sunday and we'll go on a trip. - I've met a man, a man! - I have no time. You can't picture how polite he is! And he's in his early 20s or his late 70s and bald? Mama. Who won't come, won't get to decide. - Is something broken? - The car. Show me, my love. - See, it's driving again. - Thanks. Picture this, Elise: Ludwig is a journalist. Yes, he was. - Why, is it different at the radio? - It's called editor there. Right. I remember now. - Would you like some tea? - No, thank you. Can I look through the CDs? Yes, sure. Say, how'd you pick the names Edgar and Evelyn? Uh, my mother-in-law, uh... she wanted those. What, because of your mother-in-law you named your children? Excuse me? Can I listen to those? Uh, sure, of course. Bizet... - A shortbread for you? - Oh, of course! - That'd be one cent. - Careful. One cent per bread, yes? - Would you like to get the cake? - Yes, I'll do it! Do you also have "Die Perlenfischer" from Bizet? - Yes, I do. - The duet is so beautiful. You have quite the taste in music. Yes, I wanted to be a pianist. Her father studied singing. Why'd you give it up? I haven't give it up. I... have just... "Für Elise" was my favourite. And when Elli, well Elise, was born, it was clear we'd name her that. And now? Pff... no idea. - Uh, may I? - Yes, sure. That's news to me. I thought you, you... You're interested in journalism? - Nah. - That's good like that. Journalism is an unforgiving work. Exactly. Tell her that. So tell her, how difficult it is. Why should I do that? She doesn't even want to do it. - Still missing a belt. - Beautiful. - Can you lend me 100? - Sure. - I need something for Elli too. - No problem. Thanks. I'll make sure to return it. I've returned everything last time. The 150 from last week, you can give it to me - when you have a little money. - What, I owe you 150? Yeah. The week after next, you'll get your 250. How'd you get home that time? - How'd you get home then? - Good. - Good? - Motorbike. Black leather jacket? Not clingy, two children, and the wife's just gone. And he's good for Elli. She really needs a father. How do you like it? You know, for Elli, I mean. It's a bit light for this season. So, you'll see him again? Yesterday we've been there. Hey, you're still awake. - Have you been drinking? - No. I was shopping with Kathi. We just had a beer. You said it's over now. Don't be so strict on me always. We just had one beer. Here! For you. Have you gone completely crazy? A top without sleeves? In the middle of winter? You're driving me crazy! Look, isn't it cute with the sequins? Rent you probably didn't pay either, right? - Mama! - Hm? Look, those are all demands and... bills... You really know how to spoil an evening. And at some point you could really visit my head teacher now. It's getting hard to lie to her. Yes, Elli. I'll go there. You can rely on me. But what was that? Around them there were thousands of lamps glowing But those were not lamps. It was really all stars. They've never seen it. And then the two knew, that it was good to be travelling. In search of the lost dreams. But whether they'd really find the dreams. That is a story for next time. Good night. Good night. Sleep well. Lights out. It's a nice little story. Did you invent it? - For your daughter? - Yes. But she always hated it. I'll take a water please. Oh, excuse me. I didn't know that. Where's she? Why didn't you bring her? I didn't even ask her. I mean, isn't she on her own too much? Thanks. No. You saw her, she's responsible and grown-up. Where's her father? He left us, two years ago. Traffic accident. Elise misses him a lot. I'm sorry. And... Where is... your wife? Alexandra? Yes... She... She's in France... with her new husband. But... doesn't she want to see her children? Sure, one day. She'll be in front of the door and will take them away. She can't do that. Sure she can, she's the mother. Why don't you have custody? Uh, we have shared custody. But there's a new family, that's where the two belong. I'm sorry, I can't do this. Considering these are your first egg cakes in years, they are not even that bad. Now, you two. That's it, that was great. Now you'll brush your teeth. No, we still want the story. I'll do it. - Okay. - Thank you. And then... then they'll come around the corner, drag the children from their beds. And eat them! And cut them in pieces! What's going on here? - What happened? - Hey, what are you doing? Where is Evelyn? Elise, can you answer the question please? - There. - Kid, what did you do? Well, I've modified Mama's bedtime story a bit. I must've added some monsters and ghosts by mistake. Are you scared? Well, excuse me. I didn't know they'd be scared this easily. - You'll apologize, now! - Elise, you'll leave now. - Now! - Tsh! You role-model mother! Papa, I want on your arm! Papa! Come here, darling. Come. Betty, it's better we don't see each other in the next time. You must really take care of your daughter! Hey, it's really not that bad. We'll change the pants. Come, to the bathroom. Thanks to you, we can't visit Ludwig anymore. Me neither! Never again! - That's even better. - You always destroy everything! You'll go there and apologize! And I mean now, immediately! Leave me alone. You'll go there now! I'm going nowhere, end of discussion. - There you're wrong, you'll go now! - No! You will! Go! If you really want that, I'll tell him about the real you. Not even capable of going to parent-teacher evenings. That you always get hammered when a man leaves you hanging. You want that? Do you want that? Can you please leave now? I want to watch TV. Get the fuck out! What are you doing? That is mine. - We should collect it. - What do you mean, collect it? It's mine, belongs to my father. Where's my mother? What are you doing with my piano? Here's the collection notice. It's signed by Betty Weiß. That's impossible. Where's my mother? - Where's my mother? - She left earlier. We should close the door. You'll put the piano back into the flat immediately! Take your hands off, it's mine! And you'll put it back there immediately - please! Put it back, it's mine! Please! Please... Please... How dare you? - Hey, get your hands off me! - Tell me that it's not true! What should I say? How dare you? Don't put on such an act because of the- - It's just a piano! - ... just a piano! Papa gave it to me! You've sold my single most important possession! We need the money! Are you wasted again, or what? Mama... Mama, please! Please, stop this, please! Stop it, please! Please! You'll kill us with your alcohol! You can still fix everything. You know what I mean. What? You'll go to him and apologize. And I, I... ...will stop drinking. Okay. Yes... Good. Mama! Elli, we have a deal here. That is ridiculous, he will kick us out. - He won't. - It's so embarrassing. No risk, no reward. Hello, Betty. Elise. Hello. "I'm very sorry." - I... - It's all good. All forgotten. I'm not angry. Want to see the studios? - Mhm. - No, thank you. - Don't be so shy! - Mama! - It's no problem. - Another time, hm? Well. - Come whenever you want to. - Okay. Because today's your birthday I've thought... I'll sing you this little song, because it brings you joy. - Yes... happy birthday! - Thanks. That's for you. Thank you. - That as well. - But that is... And that too. Yes, hello? - "Uh... It's Ludwig, I..." - Hello. Listen, Elise, don't freak out. Your mother... She drank a bit too much, she'll be staying here tonight. "Elise? Are you there?" Yes. Yes... "Will you be fine alone? At home?" I'll be fine here, don't worry. - What are you doing here? - Where is she? - Papi, I can't sleep! - Evelyn, hey! Hey, what... - Oh! - Mama! Mama, come! - Mmh, leave me! - We're leaving! Birthday party! - Mama, you're completely drunk! - No! Ludwig... coercion! Dance with me, man? Elise. Elise, it... I'm sorry, I didn't know, that your mother... ... drinks. Listen, I've... I put the children to sleep. It didn't even take half an hour. But then... ... the bottle was empty. Always a solution. There's none for this. I'll think of something. Promise. She fell for you. You can't take her home like this. Careful, now... I'll take her home. What do you want to do? Are you planning to carry her? I'm so sorry. Uhm... it's not your fault. If all goes well then... ... I'll get a C- in maths. Mama is unhappily in love again. And with the Étude, I can't continue playing. Papa... I can't anymore! Help me! Please! - Hello, Aunt Helga. - How are you, Elise? Not bad, thanks. Hello, Aunt Gisela. Elise, you wanted to visit us last Sunday. I'm sorry, I was really busy with exams and... I had to practice a lot. Isn't that right, Mama? Your father would be very proud. Yes, definitely, Elise. You know he can see everything from up there. Elisabeth, you wanted to pay your share of Andreas' grave. We insist you share our cost. He is as much your deceased, as he is ours. Especially mine. Elli! Elisabeth! Elisabeth! What's wrong with you, child? - Bye, Aunt Helga. - Yes, bye, my darling. - Bye, Aunt Gisela. - Bye, my darling. Come. - I've already seen you. - Yes, sure you did. You have eyes in your back. Hey! I'm happy you're here. You're not busy? No, not at all. My wishing show is running. Can I also wish for something there? What... would be your wish? Come. Yes, here, here, here... - Ludwig? - Yes? Excuse me, what? You still have to revise the Christmas show. Yes, I'll do it soon. - It's beautiful here. - Play something for me? What? Something of Schumann. - Where've you been? - At the opera. - Alone? - No, with Ludwig. You'll get on his nerves. I doubt it. Do you think? Listen, Mama. He's not fallen in love with you. - Who then? - With me. Hello, Ludwig. Hello, Betty. You're so quiet. Is something wrong? Hear this, Elise thinks, you're in love with her. Well, she misses her father. - A male role-model... - Yes, excuse me, but... I must look for Evelyn. Last day of school, you see. I, uh... wish you a nice Christmas. You too. - Hello. - Hello. So, how're you? Good, pretty good. Don't you want to join us with the children? For Christmas. I don't want to intrude. Oh... Elise would be very happy, wouldn't you be, Elise? We'll see. "Christmas is the feast of love." "Humans come together." "Big and small, young and old." "Agape, that is Ancient Greek... and means love your next." "But for Christmas we also do a lot that has nothing to do with love." "Don't worry, if the cake doesn't come out well." "If the tree falls over, or if you're disappointed with your presents." "Our last one for tonight is Beethoven's timeless masterpiece 'Für Elise' ". Hear that? He's playing my favourite... "Für Elise". You never wanted to play it. You know I don't like it. - Anyone can play it on the piano. - He's playing it just for me. You're ruining my potato stew! I just wanted to see if it's done, it looks really delicious. We must hurry. I must put on something new. And wash my hair! I bet they'll come when I'm still in the bathroom. Don't worry, I won't send them home. Most important: Take their coats! Mama, stop it, it's annoying! Think they'll really come? I'm sure of it. Shouldn't we start? The food's cold anyway. I'll call him. We'll wait 15 more minutes. We had a date. I'm sorry, I couldn't... - What's all this? - Gifts then? Uh, please... Betty, let's drop it. - Come on, unwrap your gift! - Please get dressed! For once in your life, show some courage! You ridiculous man, no dick in your pants? For fuck's sake, it's enough now. - You chicken! - Hey, it's all good! Hey! It's all good. Let go. Let go! It's good. Let it go. It's good now. It's good. Listen now. Get this into your head finally. I don't want you. I don't love you. You reek of alcohol. You're disgusting, leave. Leave my flat, is that clear? Get out. Get out here. Out. Elise? Wake up. What did you do to him? How'd you turn his head? Whose head, Mama? You don't love him. You just don't want us to be happy. Mama! Please, I... I didn't do anything. Get lost. Yes. You can get lost. Some coffee? - A cookie? - Thanks. How is your mother? Good, thanks. What did you get for Christmas? Books. Beautiful. You're so quiet today, Elise. I must leave. Elise! Your presents! - Elise, so wait please! - Elise! Mama? Mama? Mama. Mama! Mama! Mama! Take a seat first. What is it? I've been looking for you. Where's your mother? She, she... She's out with Kathi, I didn't want to join them. Want a drink? Want to wish for a song? Take me home afterwards? Sure. Is your mother still coming? No, she'll stay at Kathi's. - What happened here? - Nothing, I... ... forgot to clean. I had no nerve today. What's this then? What happened here? I had to call an ambulance. I found her drunk on the balcony. You're not staying here tonight, you'll sleep at my place, okay? Good. - Elise? - Yes? - All good in there? - Yes! - Sleep well. - Good night! I can't sleep. Uh... here, best you... Blanket... Merry Christmas. - You like it? - Yes! Thank you! Okay... Come! Hey! - Stop it! - Come on! Come! Stop it! - Stop it! - Ow! Can you open up please? I must talk to you. I must talk to you. Can you open up? Please. For fuck's sake, I... Elise, I... I want to apologize. I must apologize after all. Hey, are you there? Hell, I... I must apologize to you. I want to apologize. Elise, are you listening, please? Okay, then I'll see you tomorrow. Remember your papers please. Hey. Do you want to come? Are you well? Say, why do you never wear a belt? Because your pants always drop. See the ship there? What ship? The ship with the sailors. The ship with the sailors, who're interested in what you say about belts. Oh, look! That's the one. Elise, it's me! - Hello, Kathi. - Hello. So. - Come along to your mother? - M-m. I spoke to her on the phone. I'll go visit her tomorrow. - Anything I should tell her? - M-m. - Need anything else? - Thanks, I'm good. See you then.
