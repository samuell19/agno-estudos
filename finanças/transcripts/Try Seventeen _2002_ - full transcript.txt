Test, test, test. This is a test. One, two, test. Kid. Are you lost, kid? Hey. Where's, uh, where's your big brother, kid? I don't have one. Yeah? Don't you look a little too kiddie-like to be in college? You still wetting the bed? Well, congratulations. Now, here's the deal, I listen to ska music, right? Just ska. No rap, no punk, no hip-hop, no heavy metal, no classical, no classic rock, no new wave, no new age, no bluegrass, no blues, no jazz, and no fuckin' country. I ain't no bumpkin like the rest of you pukes.

Well, most people I rent to like to see the place before they take it. Ok. There are two white girls upstairs with you, and a white man has the first floor. You'll be just fine here, Jones. Snug like a bug. Thank you. What is this? My rent check. $12,000? Well, that was the figure on the lease. It's my grandfather's money, or it was, anyway. He went to college here and the will said I had to come here, too. And I didn't want to go to Texas. What's in Texas? Just my mother. You'll be glad to know I dropped out of college today. You told me yourself, all a writer needs is his eyes and ears, and sense enough to use them. Besides, you know I don't play well with the other kids. Better watch your ass, punk! Yeah, punk! You know how much this means to me. Don't be like this. Look, I'll be there in twenty minutes, ok? Don't be this way. Ok, I'm fine... I'll just hang up right now. I'm hanging up now!

Jones. Jones Dillon. You listen to Ma, now, 'cause she speaks the truth. There is nothing, absolutely nothing, as important as a bed. Nothing? Nothing! A happy bed makes for a happy home, Mr. Jones. If you take my meaning. Jones, hmm, Jones. I knew a man named Jones once. Yes, indeed! Maybe he was your daddy. I doubt it, ma'am. Well, I wouldn't be too sure, now. He was a handsome devil, just like you are. Phone? I... I don't have one yet. I'll get one. Well, you be sure and let Ma know just as soon as you do. Hi, Ma. Oh, boys, this is Mr. Jones. Will you tell him when you all can deliver him his furniture? Be a week at least. Be at least a week, maybe two. Could be two. That's ok. Fine. We ain't askin'. No one's askin' you nothin'. Now you boys shut the hell up. Talkin' to my customers like that. Now, get out! Sorry, Ma. Go on! Get! From my second husband. Kid, you ain't twenty-one. Twenty-two. Twenty-three in December.

Yeah, just be a second. Anything else? Pack of cigarettes. Scheißauto! Shit! Brad? Brad? Brad? Come on! Hi. Think you can mess with me, you little bastard, huh? You think that? Think you can? Hi, Jane. Hi, Brad. Who's your friend? Asshole tried to attack me. Oh, bad boy. Think I should shoot him? No, I'll do it. Well, well, well. Lookie-here. Caught yourself a deviant, did you? I live here, you lunatics! Oops. What? Boy says he lives here, ma'am. I'm in 2B. Upstairs. I just moved in. He's making it up. Listen, hot stuff, are you 2B, or not? Yes, damn! I'm 2B! Well, all-rightie, then. I just got you wired up for the great wide world and everything in it. I saw the whole thing. It was a mistake. Don't be so sure. Are you ok? Yeah. Come on. This makes us neighbors, I suppose. I'm Lisa. I'm Jones. Hi. Hi. You can keep them if you want. Call it a housewarming. Thank you. I... I'd ask you to stay. And I'd ask you, "where would I sit?" You can sit here. I think it's much too soon for that, don't you? Goodbye, Jones. Hello? Hello, Blanche. Guess who? Oh, lovely. My only begotten son. Don't tell me they kicked you out of school already. I wasn't expecting this call for at least a month. Relax, Blanche. You'll spill your drink. I'm calling with good news. I'm calling from my very own phone. From the comfort of my very own apartment. Your what? Have you lost your mind, Jones? If there's anyone in this world who cannot take care of himself, it is you. Do you hear me? No, you're right. In fact, I've been interviewing help all week. I'm leaning towards this beautiful young Asian girl. Cantonese. Cantonese, I mean. She's expert in ancient massage techniques. See there? I knew it. All those prep schools turned you into a little sex monster, didn't they? Blanche, I called to ask you something. Oh, god, here we go. I'm going to need a copy of my birth certificate. It's for the school. Yeah, I bet. Well, have the school get in touch with me then. I have a right, Blanche. For Christ's sake! Jones, couldn't we just have a conversation where you didn't dredge up all the footnotes of your ancestry? What if I called your father a footnote? Yeah, well, just don't call him an overbearing, manipulative son of a bitch. I'd hate for us to agree on something, Jones. I think my own father would like to know where I am, what I'm doing. It's late. You probably have school tomorrow. Uh, Jones? Don't you dare. Jones? Well, son of a... Bitch. I have done something to make you angry? No, not you. Yes, indeed, Mr. Jones. A happy bed makes for a happy home, and Ma, here, is going to show you just how happy a home can be. Well, my bed hasn't been delivered yet. Just you leave everything to me. I'd have called first if I had that number. Yes, indeed, Mr. Jones. Get comfortable, Mr. Jones. Oh! Mr. Jones, you are a handsome devil. Oh, my. Yes! Oh! Shh! Look at how happy you are! Just a minute, Mr. Jones. Here comes your bed now! Treat me wild. Ooh! Oh, Mr. Jones. Rough, just like your daddy was. Jones! Damn. Jones! No, don't! One, two. No! Boy, there's something you probably ought to know. You got shit-wipe sticking out of your fly. Don't. Please! One, two... Freeze! Put it down, fellas. Nice and easy. We can't very well do nothing, bein' as we's frozen, and all. Bad joke, daddy-o. One more and I blow your little sister's best friend right out of your trousers. You think they treat all of their customers that way? No, you're just lucky. Lucky you were there. There, that's all of it. Wow. If you hadn't shown up like that, I don't know. Let me get you a beer. "Freeze!" The looks on their faces. Hi, Brad. And who would've ever guessed those guys could be so polite? You go easy on him. Ok. Easily the most exciting thing I've ever seen in real life. Hi. Hi. Where's... Gone. Look. Now you can stay. You want a beer? Oh, I'm gonna have to take a rain check. I have lines to learn. You're an actress. The female lead. Wow. Besides, I still don't know where I would sit. Are you sure that's clean? Your stalker has furniture. Hi. You ok? Yeah, sure. How are you? Great couch. Dear dad, I'm settling into apartment life just fine. I know it was more your style to move around a lot, place to place, but I think I'll stay right here for now. And why not?

And it would've been almost bearable if, just once, you'd written me a letter to tell me that you were still alive, and that your love for me was still alive, too. How could I have known you lost both your arms in battle? Damn you. Haven't I told you never to speak of that? Never! You foolish, proud man. Don't you see it doesn't matter? You can still touch me. You've still a heart to love me. Still lips to kiss me. You can touch me without arms. And I need you to, darling, desperately. Please, touch me. Touch me now. Touch me right now! Blah, blah, blah. God, it's awful. Well, you're good. Really? I mean, not just compared to you? A glass, please? Oh, well, I don't have any yet. Sorry. You know, I find it awfully sad, really. Well, I'm going to get some. No, not that. You know, a person can pursue something. A girl can go after her dream and give it her energy, labor, sweat, tears, and this is where it gets her. A two-room apartment and a role in some moronic period play. Things take time? Right. Things take time. I suppose. But I can't wait forever. Can I ask you something? Sure. You can ask me anything. Who's the girl with the camera? She's called Jane. Why? Well, she took my picture, out here. She didn't say a word, just took my picture and disappeared. It was weird. She is weird. You know what? I'd be careful if I were you. She took pictures of me once, and now she hates me. Hates you? Why? I have no idea. Except, I think she's maybe slightly insane. Insane?

Is this one any good? Yeah, it's fine. Fine if you're going to Disneyland with a wife and kids. Right. Well, I guess I'll have to plan a trip then, and a wedding. Here. Point and shoot. Right. Uh, how did that picture come out... On the roof? Not so hot. What did you say your name was again? Jones. I'm Jane. Hi. Bye, Jones. Ready? Ready. Beer? Oh! Oh, my, no, no. This calls for wine. I have a terrific bottle I've been saving. You have a corkscrew, right? Damn. Here, let me. It's a sticky one. And that's how it started. She opened the wine and started to pour, and pour, and pour, like words on a page. Big words like "ambition," and "inspiration," and "passion." Me? I didn't say much, but she didn't mind. She knew I was watching her. I think she likes to be looked at, but I wanted to do more than look. After all, I couldn't type, could I, if I didn't touch the keys? And she was so close, it should have been easy, but somewhere, somehow, I think I missed something. You know what I mean? Yeah. You do? No. You don't? I don't know. I'm sorry. It's late. I'm drunk. I have to go. Morning, partner. Shouldn't I have handcuffs, too? Sorry, partner. I've only got one pair. Don't you think we should drink them first? No. You'd never hit 'em that way. That's right. Steady. Use your sight. Line it up. Now what are you gonna do? Squeeze. Squeeze. What are you not going to do? Pull. Beautiful. Whenever you're ready. Perfect. You squeezed. So what do you think of Lisa? Lisa? Yeah, upstairs Lisa. How do you mean? Well, you're seeing her, aren't you? Did she say something to you? No. I just know. How? It's an old house. I know the creaks. I know what goes on. When she's in her bathroom, brushing her teeth, putting on just a bit of eye make-up. I hear her move from her apartment to yours. You let her in, she looks great. She takes a seat on the couch, makes herself comfortable. You offer her something to drink. You excuse yourself to the kitchen. "Mineral water or I have a light beer?" "Mineral water, please. In a glass if you don't mind?" Mineral water? Oh, come on. It's not like I'm snooping, really. I just hear it. There's a lot of turnover upstairs. And everybody leaves a story behind. Now, I can tell those stories, but I don't. And I won't tell yours, either, Jones. Together, this time.

You cook a meal for a man just once... And he thinks he can call you on the phone. What he thinks is that he's got a god-given right to tell me what to do, where to go, and what time to be there. Maybe he wants to show you the world. Istanbul, Mozambique. What are you talking about? You know what I'm talking about! My father. You said he'd been everywhere, seen everything. That he'd written it all down... every sight, every sound... So that when he met you he could show you the world. I never told you that. He told me that. I remember more than you think I do. You know, I'm getting dressed, here, Jones. What did you do, Blanche? What did you do that was so bad he left both of us? You know, if you gave school half the energy you give this little genealogy project, I bet you they'd name a building after you. I am taking it seriously. In fact, there's an instructor here, right now. Oh, instructor, hell. What instructor? It's art class. We're doing nudes this week. Wow. But she said I could sketch some gin bottles for extra credit.

I need you to, darling, desperately. Please, touch me. Touch me right now! At least someone's been rehearsing. It was bad, wasn't it? You can tell me. You were good. Can you say that again, please, with just a little bit more feeling? You were good. Jones? Will you kiss me? Ok. "Ok," because you want to, or "ok," because I asked you to? I want to. Will you do it now, please? Ok, I will, but... Sorry. I'm not very good at this. Oh, but you will be. You will be. Let me tell you the story of a girl there was not another like her in the world I'm sure I won't be the last to tell of her I'm sure I ain't the first guy in the world to hear her tell a lie, to see her start to cry I know she's got nothing on her mind what are you waiting for? Who could ever say um. She'd be unkind this isn't your first time, is it? Could be the way she got her start could be what? What? Are you serious? Jones, my god. What do you think this is? Nothing. I mean... God, exactly. You know what? You can't do this with me. Not like this. I mean, Jones, you're really sweet and everything, but, my god, how old are you anyway? Seventeen. Seventeen? My god, what am I doing? You know what, Jones? You need to fall in love first. Love? Yes. Love! Seventeen-year-olds can fall in love. By the time I was seventeen, I'd already loved three or four boys. Like, really truly loved them. You're right. Of course, I'm right. Trust me on this, Jones. You don't want to do this. You're right. You think you do, but... What did you say? I said, "you're right." Right about what? About this, about us. I... I don't want to. Like you said. What? Ok, the show's over. I'm through being an audience, just looking on and listening. I want someone who's more than words. Because if I've learned anything so far, it's this: Talk is cheap, partner. So you say it's a party you want, huh? Hell, woman, I'll show you a party. What did I tell you about coming down here and celebrating? Damn it, I've got dishes at home that need washing! You've done crossed me for the last time. Speak up, damn it, I'm talking to you! Oh, dear god, help me. It's Jones Dillon. Coming to kill me. Please, Dillon, I wasn't gonna hurt her. Honest. You'd best say goodbye to them buttons, you no-arm son of a bitch. Mr. Dillon. You have a shave scheduled, Mr. Dillon. A shave. And a bath? That's me. But Jones, this animal said he was going to roll me down main street! Down main street, right out of town, one kick at a time. Squeeze. With spurs on, Jones! I need a ride. You didn't have to do this. That's ok. I've been meaning to buy some records. We don't sell records. Oh. I thought you said it was a record store. It's just called a record store. It's all CD's. Right. Well, I... I don't have a record player anyway. ♪ She says, so I guess this is it ♪ ♪ He said, I guess it is ♪ ♪ She touched his hand once ♪ ♪ And gave his head a kiss ♪ Look, I don't care if you don't like the picture, ok? What picture? It's not going to hurt my feelings, but you could have at least acknowledged the damn thing, you know? What picture? The picture I gave you. The picture I slipped under your door! I put it in an envelope and... Look, there's no way you didn't... Oh, god damn it. She likes you, right? Who? Who? The bitch that... Just forget it, forget it. I'm sorry. He slowly gripped are you coming in? No. I don't have a CD player, either. Will you need a ride home? No. I'll manage. How about you? Took a stool next to her I'll ask the bartender he said, I'm just gonna lie ok, shut it off. That's great. How do you know all of this stuff? I learned it from rocky. Who's rocky? That motorcycle in my apartment? Yeah. That's rocky's. He left that behind, the rogue. He was my last. He lived in your apartment for a while, but he spent most of his time in mine. Then he moved on. That was three years ago. Jones? Yeah? It's been three years since I had sex, Jones. Whoa. Did you say "whoa"? Three years and you say, "whoa"? Listen, you, three years of celibacy deserves more than "whoa." "Whoa" doesn't come close. Try seventeen. What, years? Well, the first twelve were pretty easy. But what about... So you're a... Whoa. It's great. It's really great. It's the pain. The pain? That's why I like it, because it's honest and it's real and it's nothing you can fake or hide. I don't know. To me, it's like you're feeling pain for the first time in your life. And before this moment, you didn't even know it existed. I broke my arm once when I was a kid. How is it that someone you've only just met, that a person you hardly know, can somehow know you? Can take one look at you and see more in that instant than most people will ever see? I suppose there's only one way to find out. Hi, Jane. Hi. Hi. Uh, I was wondering if you would, you know, if you'd like to go out on... You're a little young for me, Jones. Besides, I don't date. Well, it wouldn't be a date. I just don't know many people here and I thought, maybe we could... Maybe you should get a record player. But we don't have to. I don't do movies, no dinners, no picnics, no walks. How about you decide? I hear you typing a lot. What are you writing? Letters, mostly. Letters to who, your girlfriend? Girlfriends... There are several. Is that right? Get the fuck out of here! Superfecta's the big one. The first four horses in order... A bitch to win, but top-dollar pay. Trifecta is the same deal, but the first three horses in order. Still's a bitch, still good money. Exacta bet is first and second in order. Quinella is the same, but in any order. So those are good. Win, place, or show bets, you can figure out for yourself. Are you talking to me? Yes, dummy. How do you want to bet? I have no idea. How about you bet for me and I'll get us some drinks? Sure you will. How did you do that? A trick I learned from my mother. So what are we drinking to? Close your eyes and point. "New in town." "New in town." Yes! "New in town," run, run, run!

No, it isn't. Fair enough. Then I'll ask you something. Name? Jones Dillon. Age? Seventeen. From? Texas. No funny accent. I grew up in the east, mostly. Me, too. Boarding schools and summer camps. What about your parents? What parents? How many orphans go to boarding schools? Lots. Who's Steve? I thought you didn't want to know. He's your old boyfriend? One of several. Are you telling me you're an orphan? Not exactly. How many is several? Wouldn't you like to know? I just want to know about one. That's it. Out of film. That's it? Why? You thought you were getting somewhere? So is there anything else I should know about you? I don't think so, unless... What? No. Spill it. I'm a virgin. Never? All those girlfriends and no action? Well, I almost did once. Really, when? Recently. How recently? Pretty recently. I'm going to tell you something. If you want to hang out with her, you don't hang out here, ok? I'll hang out here. Ok. Jane? Yeah? I'm sorry. I'm sorry about the kiss. So what do you know about Jane and Steve? Can't do it. Sorry. Can't do what? Can't say. It's one of those upstairs stories, partner. Sorry. But you know? Can't say. But there's something to know, right? Is there? Damn. Partner? She's at your door. Hi! I didn't think you were home. I... I'm not. I wasn't, but I am now. Now I am. Want to go for a ride? In a half an hour? Blanche is in Texas. Who? Blanche, my mother. You asked me about my parents. She lives alone, drinks, dates mostly men from the country club. She ran my father off when I was three... Or four. Her story always changes. What? This is the part where you tell me about Steve. Is that right? I used to work in this shitty little bar. Steve came with his band, like, they were playing a stadium show, or something. And for the next three nights he sang every song for me. I'd never met anybody like him. He said all of the right things. He did all the right things. Everything was so right. Then he fucked it all up. Me especially. You seem ok to me. I used to be better than ok. Oh, shit! Fuck! Dr. Martin, cardiology. "New in town." How are you? How do I look? You look great. How's your arm? Oh, I'll pull through, I think. Thank god. I'm miserable, Jones. That must hurt pretty bad. No. I'm so bored. Right. Maybe you should get a record player. Shut up. You know what I want? I want you to write me a letter. A letter? Yeah, like the ones you write to your girlfriends. But just a letter letter, not a love letter. I don't have any girlfriends. I write them to someone else. Well, I am someone else. Write one to me. No. I mean, I don't send them. Uh, it's complicated. Jones, I'm in the hospital for Christ's sake. I think I deserve at least a letter. I knew it. I knew it. I knew that something like this was gonna happen to you. No, Blanche, really, I'm fine. I'm going to pull through. You see, Jones, this is what happens. I tell you things and you don't listen to me. You don't ever listen to me, do you? Well, you don't ever tell me what I want to hear, do you? Don't you start. This is about you, Jones. This is about reality. Listen, I'm gonna have to hang up now, I've got breakfast coming. There's a place here that delivers bagels and belly dancers. It's fantastic. Are you drunk, Jones? What are you talking about, belly dancers? Oh, here she is. Jones? You can set that down anywhere. I'm gonna sing a love song for you, baby. How did he find out? I called him. You were bored and miserable, so you called him. Wrong. I missed him and I wanted to call him, so I did. Didn't he fuck you up, or something? What's your problem, Jones? I thought we were friends. He came 2,000 miles, Jones. She can't help herself, Jones. It's a biological weakness for the black leather/ guitar-player type. I've experienced bouts of it myself. It's powerful stuff. Well, it's... it's good, really. I'm happy for her. She seems happy, too. She's good. It's great. Grab your hammer, partner. Hi, Jones. Hi, Lisa. Did you see Jane's car? What happened to your arm? Oh. You were with her. Well, I'm glad you're ok. What about Jane? She's ok. I'm glad. You know when something like this happens, it kind of makes me wonder if I should tell her I'm sorry. Well, it was the deer's fault, mostly. Is that for me? I write them to my father. I don't send them because I don't know his address. Because I don't know if he's alive or dead or anything else. Nothing. Only you. Ok. Say it. Only me. Jones? I'll be leaving soon. I know. I don't mean just from the hospital. I know. Hey, guy. Hey, Steve. Ah, the, uh, famous copilot. Jones, right? Right. Yeah. How's the arm? You fucked her, didn't you? What? Lisa. Oh, yeah. You? But it was nothing. Nothing? Yeah. Jane took these pictures of her. You know, sexy stuff, where she was wrapped in these scarves, and, uh, I wanted to find out what was under there. But, uh, it was nothin'. And I mean, Jane took it pretty hard. I mean, Jane takes everything pretty hard. What am I telling you for? You don't even have a CD player. Dear dad, you'll be glad to know I'm recovering from the accident, and that girl I told you about, she's as good as new. What I can't figure out is how could I have been so stupid? How? You're listed. That Brad person downstairs. He told me which apartment, so... That Brad person? Yeah. You know, he made a pass at me. Wouldn't you know it? You look nice, Blanche. Well... Then ask me to sit down. Well, thank you, Mr. Sophisticated. Mmm. I got a motorcycle. Well, isn't that nice. Maybe I should throw myself off this roof, save the trouble of having to bury you. I don't think the fall would kill you, but you could try it. Tell me about this Jane person. Skip the part about her being a lousy driver though. I don't know. She's a lot like you, actually. That's exactly what happens. Boys always chase after girls that remind them of their mothers. She drinks, she's rude, she's loud. Yeah, ok. Shut up, will you? Is she pretty? She's beautiful. What about you, Blanche? Are you making anyone miserable on a regular basis? Well, if that's you're cute way of asking if I'm in love with anybody, the answer is no. Come on, Blanche. Well, sure, there might be times when I'm sweet on a man. I like to feel good as much as the next girl. But don't confuse feeling good with being in love, Jones. Now those two roads, they rarely cross. Rarely or never? Why are you still dragging around that beat-up trunk? That's all I have, that and this typewriter. Well, why don't you see if you've got a blanket in there for me? I guess it's getting late. We'll talk tomorrow. Ok.

It's beautiful. You guys are unbelievable. Well, all I did was beat on it. How would you like to drive it? Around the block or 2,000 miles one way? Ok. I'll do it. Why would you do it? We're friends, right? Yeah, we're friends. Poor guy, he's crying. Crying, wow. I'll only be gone for a couple of days. Shut up, Jones, and drive. Right. "I'm sorry, Jones. I don't have any answers. "Not many, anyway. "And probably none that would make you very happy. "No one ever looked at me the way your father did. He didn't see a pretty girl with a rich daddy." He saw someone with hopes and dreams of her own, and I would have followed him anywhere. Well, we only got as far as a little cabin in a motor court. I made eggs and toast in the kitchen, and we laughed, made love, and drank whiskey. And I wasn't more than fifty miles from home, but it felt like 5,000. And those two little rooms, they felt like the whole wide world to me. But for him, I think it was just another dot on another map. I'm sorry, Jones. I know I told you a lot of pretty things about your father, things I wanted to believe, too, but the truth is you never met your daddy. One day he went out for cigarettes and he never came back. These letters of yours are hilarious. I wish you'd let me show this one to Steve, where I'm tied up in the trunk and you come to my rescue. I know what he did. What who did? Steve. I know what he did. Oh. Jesus! Are you trying to get me drunk? I tried to pretend it didn't happen, that I didn't know, that I couldn't see it in his face. But why? Why pretend? Because I didn't want to go back to the way it was before. With Steve, there's no yesterday, no tomorrow, just now. Always and forever, now. For the first time in my life, I knew what it felt like to be free. Let me try. I could do it, Jane. I could rescue you. You are so nice. I could fuck Lisa if nice is a problem for you. We're too much alike. I could see it in the photos I took. I can see it now. Are you afraid of the dark? I thought you'd want it. You can switch it off. Jones, this is not happening. Say it.

Texas, Delaware, three schools in New Hampshire, Kansas, not everywhere, so maybe I'm wrong. But I think you're probably the most beautiful woman in the world. What did you say? Nothing. You said something. I said, we're here. Hey, guy! I can't believe this piece of crap actually made it. You can't do this. Don't. What's that? That stays. Oh, right, the top secret funny stuff. What was I thinking? Last night did happen. Please, Jones. What happened last night? Nothing. Nothing happened last night. Yes, it did, and it wasn't nothing. It was something. Stop it. Is this something I should know about? No. Yes. It is. In your dreams, kid. What are you doing, Jones? Steve, stop it! Stop it! Get in the car, Jones. I want to talk to you. Why did you do that? Jane, what are you doing? Come on, open up! You're better than this, Jane. You're better than ok. Come on, open the goddamn car! Give me a minute. Give me a minute! Last night was now, wasn't it? There was no yesterday, no tomorrow, and it still is now. It's not too late. Jones, it is tomorrow. I'm here. I... I cannot go back. Jane... Does it hurt? I want you to take the car. I don't want the car. Take it anyways. You fixed her. You put her back together. Close your eyes Maggie Cassidy and take your leave of me oh, shit! Somebody called the cops! Let's get the hell out of here. Let's go, man! That I thought I'd be piece of shit car! Let's go. Let's go! Mmm. Hello? It was me, wasn't it, Blanche? Jones? All of these years, I blamed you. I thought it was your fault, but it was me, always me. Jones, where are you? Why didn't you tell me the truth about why he left? That he left because you got pregnant? Because, uh... Oh, honey. Because I didn't want you to feel the way I did. I thought I could at least do that for you. So you could send me away to school and every summer. No, that was your granddaddy's doing. He said that I'd... I'd never make for any kind of a mother and I should just take care of it. You were my chance, Jones. That he might come back. I was your chance that he'd come back. No. I knew he wasn't coming back. You can't stop some people, Jones. They come into your life destined to leave it. You can wrap your arms tight around them, but the best that you can hope to do is just slow 'em down a little, because there's no holding on tight enough. But you were mine. You were my chance and I blew it. Blanche. No. You didn't blow it, Blanche. Jones! Guess what? You're moving out. Guess why I'm moving out. You got a part. Yes! It's a musical revue on a cruise ship, so my stuff is going into storage, and I'm going to sea! What happened to your eye? Oh, it's nothing. Congratulations, Lisa. I left you something. It's gonna be worth something someday. You want me to autograph it for you?
