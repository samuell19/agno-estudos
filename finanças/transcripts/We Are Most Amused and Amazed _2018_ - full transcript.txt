Tonight on... Sandi Toksvig. I love celebrating a big birthday. Wallace and Gromit. I bet Morph's there, he gets everywhere. Rowan Atkinson. You're all here for... eternity. Bill Bailey. 'Ere, let me through, I'm a doctor. Penn and Teller. Teller will do the physical evidence, while I do the deduction. Mischief Theatre. Think of a card. In my brain? If you have one. Omid Djalili. I audibly heard someone say, "There used to be a pool table in here." These guys... Whoever they are. This is like Charlie's party. What Charlie? Charlie from the Windsor crew. What? And many, many more. I'm rather excited. So am I, Ben. So am I. You join us here at the London Palladium as Their Royal Highnesses the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall arrive for a night of comedy and magic. FANFARE # God save our gracious Queen # Long live our noble Queen # God save the Queen # Send her victorious # Happy and glorious # Long to reign over us # God save the Queen. # CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Welcome to the London Palladium. Before we begin the show, here are a few important notices to ensure tonight's performance is a safe and enjoyable one. Good evening. To maximise everyone's enjoyment of the Prince's birthday celebration, please take this opportunity to escape from technology and social media and put your phones into aeroplane mode. Or, if you're a member of the monarchy, ceremonial-carriage mode. Thank you. TINNY MUSIC PLAYS It's just my phone, it's ringing... I... Hold on. Oh, I don't like them anyway, never mind. Sorry. As we're in a theatre, please remember that it's very, very unlucky to quote from, or to name, Shakespeare's Scottish play. Do you think people have any idea what you're on about? Do you think it's worth saying which play, just so they're sure? No, that would be unlucky. Right. Could you whisper it? Just whisper... SHE WHISPERS: Hamlet. No. Hamlet is set in Denmark. Is it? Yes! Is it Richard III? No. Richard III is set in England, he was King of England. Was he? Yes. It's not Merchant Of Venice, is it? Italy. The clue's in the title. Mousetrap. No! It's Macbeth! Maccy, Maccy, Macbeth. It's easy. Are you sure you want to say that out loud? I thought you said that was fantastically unlucky. I... Oh! We would like to assure theatre-goers that there is in fact plenty of armrest space for everyone, provided you follow this simple time-share system. For the first 15 minutes, lean on your right arm rest, then for the next 37 minutes, use the armrest on your left. Then, for the following 20 minutes, please refrain from using the armrests altogether. Then, after that, we invite you to employ both armrests by romantically linking arms with the person next to you regardless of whether or not you know them. LAUGHTER Remember, you can order an interval drink before the show. However, now the show's begun, you're too late. You snooze, you lose. Cheers, sweeties. LAUGHTER Hi. I'm Martin Freeman. LAUGHTER Now, if you get hungry in the interval, then ice creams are available and you don't have to be Sherlock Holmes, or indeed Dr Watson to work out where to go for one. Hi, one mint choc chip, please. I'm the programme seller, the ice cream vendor's up there. You couldn't just play along, could you? It's just an announcement, really, if you just... Is it all right? I can't possibly say this, it's very rude. Er... Well, don't worry, we'll bleep it. Oh. Oh, well, I suppose it's OK then. Dame Judi, take one. Action. Swearing in the theatre is prohibited. So words like BLEEP, BLEEP and BLEEP, BLEEP, BLEEP will simply not be tolerated. That is brilliant, Dame Judi. Thanks. You're BLEEP welcome. If you need to go to the toilet during the performance, don't inconvenience people in your row by squeezing past them to go to the bathroom. Simply use the special built-in pouch in your spacesuit. LAUGHTER Just like I have there. Sorry, Tim, you're not wearing your spacesuit, you're just wearing your overalls. They're porous. Oh, man, not again. LAUGHTER Can we get some wet wipes for the seat? And, finally, please be warned that any raucous behaviour, including heckling, drunkenness and petty vandalism will result in your being injected from the venue. Even if it is your birthday, Your Royal Highness. Happy birthday, Sir. Enjoy the show. Your Royal Highnesses, ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Alexander Armstrong and Ben Miller. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Your Royal Highnesses, thank you very much indeed, and, ladies and gentlemen, a very good evening to you all. And a very warm welcome to We Are Most Amused And Amazed. A night of spectacular magic and comedy in celebration of Prince Charles' 70th birthday. Now, all the proceeds from tonight's show will go to The Prince's Trust, this is a charity that has helped more than 900,000 people since it was formed in 1976. In fact, there you are, Rebecca Bernice Amissah, who sang the national anthem, there we are, a fantastic example of someone who has benefited from The Prince's Trust. And, by the way, a huge thanks to Rebecca for opening the show, alongside the fanfare team from the band of The Welsh Guards. But of course... Yes... APPLAUSE But, of course, the real reason you're all here is to witness the long-anticipated reunion of Armstrong and Miller. Yeah, well, it's been a few years since we last worked together. But, you know, when you've been a double act as long as we have, you never lose that special connection and, you know, we still have the most incredible... Arguments. ..chemistry. Chemistry. Alexander's right, after you've spent years as part of a double act, you never forget how to do it. It's just like riding a... A cockhorse to Banbury Cross. LAUGHTER Could I speak to you for a moment? Sorry. A what horse? Cockhorse. To see a fine lady upon a white horse. There's a line, Alexander, isn't there? Yeah? Of good taste, just remember who's here and let's just take a step back from the line. Yeah. LAUGHTER It's like riding a... Bicycle. ..bicycle, thank you. Well, look, we both know what we bring to the act. I do the set-ups, Ben does the... Hollywood movies. The punch lines. The punch lines. Punch lines, punch lines. Now, moving on. Tonight of course isn't just about us, we have an amazing line-up of comedy stars and world-famous magicians here to entertain you, with many of our acts travelling from all over the world to be here. I'm rather excited. So am I, Ben. So am I. OK, London Palladium, let's get on with the show, are you ready for the sharp, no-nonsense, quick-witted face of The Great British Bake Off? I certainly am. Here to put the cherry on top of the birthday cake, she'll need a ladder, it's the wonderful Sandi Toksvig. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Oh! Can I just say? I love celebrating a big birthday, OK? So this year, I turned 60. Mhm. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE And everybody said I ought to do something special and I do not know why hiring the Palladium never occurred to me. LAUGHTER It seems so obvious. I have to say, it makes the room above our local look a little shabby. Anyway, one of my friends said to me, she said, "You are 60, Sandy, what you need is a toy boy." And I thought, "Wow, you do not know me well." LAUGHTER A toy boy. Although, you know, it's a thought, Camilla. Just, you know... LAUGHTER Come on! Everybody's thinking about him, what about that lovely lady? No. So you know what I did? On the morning of my 60th birthday, I gave up wearing small pants. Yeah. Yeah. Older women will appreciate this. I now wear them to here! LAUGHTER DROWNS SPEECH If I ever go to a Tom Jones concert, I will kill that man. He'll have a marquee coming at him. Death by pantage. LAUGHTER I gave up small pants and I also gave up even pretending that one day I'm going to get fit. I just can't be arsed. And, honestly, I have the perfect job for this. If you don't know what I do, this is literally my day at work, OK? I stand in a tent and I say, "Bakers, you have one minute." I don't move at all, right? 60-seconds later I say, "Bakers, your time is up." And 12 people bring me cake. LAUGHTER This is not a job anybody mentioned at school. It is absolutely fantastic. And when I was at school, everybody was always going on about getting fit. Honestly, I couldn't be bothered then, I am certainly not doing it now. These days, if my partner says to me, "Let's run upstairs and make love", I say, "Make up your mind cos it's going to be one or the other." You know what's the best thing about getting older? You start saying whatever you like and you should try that, Sir, it's very liberating. LAUGHTER So I love the idea of saying or doing whatever occurs to me and I have learned this from people even older than me. So this is a true story, right? I was taking my daughter to an open day at Bournemouth University. Well, she's 28, she needs to get out of the house. And we stopped at one of those motorway service places and as soon as we went inside, she did what I think young people are trained to do, she went straight off to a retail opportunity, presuming I would be following with money. LAUGHTER Anyway, I didn't have any, so I went over to a cash machine and I had forgotten my glasses. I can't see that well without them. So I was really concentrating when this little old lady barrelled up to me. I don't know where she was going, maybe she was being made to go on a coach trip to see the sea one last time, I have no idea. And she was wearing something I hadn't seen for years, she was wearing a Pakamac. What a marvellous early-warning sound that is. She rustled up to me. I was concentrating, like this, and she went, "Hello, Sandi." I said, "Oh, yes, hello." And I carried on, like this. She said, "You're very funny." I said, "Oh, that's enormously kind, thank you so much." She said, "That's not why I like you." I said, "No?" She said, "No, Sandi, I like you because you, like me, "are not a specific shape." LAUGHTER Then she rustled off again. So those are my top tips for getting older. Sit about in big pants saying whatever the heck you like. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Yes! Happy birthday, Sir. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Still to come, Dynamo. Maybe, Sarah, the page was never there to begin with. And Rowan Atkinson. You must be feeling a right bunch of nitwits. Now, as well as His Royal Highness being a big fan of comedy, he also loves his magic. So much so that he became a member of the Magic Circle in 1975. True fact. Which makes it only right that we invited some of the world's best magicians to perform tonight. So, ladies and gentlemen, please welcome magician extraordinaire... Oh, hang on. I think we've got a video call coming through. Er... I don't understand why we weren't invited. It's his 70th, you know. I bet Morph's there, he gets everywhere. Not now, Gromit. Oh, oh, look, it's on. Where's my speech, lad? Must still be in the typewriter. You say your bit and I'll go and get it. LAUGHTER HAPPY BIRTHDAY TUNE PLAYS BANGING Oh, heck, this is a right dog's dinner, this is. We'll have to go to Plan B, lad. I propose a toast. Happy birthday, chuck. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Chuck, bit overfamiliar? I know, I know, I think it's different rules for plasticine. Anyway, ladies and gentlemen, he's stunned the world with his sorcery ever since he was a mere boy wizard and has gone on to become one of the greatest magicians of all time. Ladies and gentlemen, in his first television appearance in over two years, please, give it up for the original Magician Impossible, Dynamo! CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Thank you. I was 12 years old when I saw magic for the very first time. It was early November 1995, I remember because they'd just started playing Christmas adverts on the television and outside it felt like it had been raining forever. I was at my nana and grandpa's flat and one night, my grandpa came walking up to me. He was looking a bit more serious than usual. He said, "Stephen, do you know what these are?" In his hand, he held a small, green matchbox. "They're matches, Grandpa," I said. I was 12, but I wasn't an idiot. He opened the box to show me it was full of matches. Then he closed it shut, shook the box three times, you could literally hear all the matches rattling around inside. And he placed it on my hand. He paused, dramatically. "Open the box, Stephen," he said. I opened it and to my complete amazement, all of the matches had vanished. It was impossible. It was like my grandpa was a flipping superhero or something. But before I had a chance to say anything, he just walked off, mysteriously. Now, sadly, my grandpa can't be here with us tonight. But I want to show you something that I wish I could have shown him. I need someone to help me out. Now, there's a very special person here tonight who, like me, was also supported by the incredible work at The Prince's Trust. She's got no idea I'm going to get her up here, but if you could make her feel welcome, a nice round of applause for Sarah McHarg. Where is Sarah? APPLAUSE There she is. So I'm going to put a microphone on you down here, this gentleman will put a microphone on you. That's good, keep it going for Sarah. APPLAUSE How you doing? Nice to meet you. Come join me over this way. How you doing, Sarah? You OK? I'm very well, thank you. So, Sarah, before we start, I need to give you something. It's really important. It's a little green matchbox. Can you put that somewhere safe for me? Have you got a pocket? Perfect. And I've got something else for you. I've got a stack of books here, Sarah. Now, they're all different, you might recognise some of them, like War Of The Worlds, Oliver Twist, Frankenstein, that sort of thing. Choose any book you like. Yep, take it out, Les Miserables, classic. Hold on to it for a second. I want you to open the book somewhere in the middle. And now, in your head, not out loud, I just want you to read any sentence on the page that you opened up at. So read that sentence in your head a couple of times so you remember it. And then before you close the book, make sure you know the page number, as well. So you got the sentence roughly in your head? And you got the page number? Yes. Perfect, close up the book. I'm going to give you a pen, just come over this way a little bit. I want you to write down the page number on your left palm like this. But I don't want to see it, so once you've written it down, close your hand into a fist. Let me know when you've done that. Can I look? Just done. Perfect. I'll take the pen. Yeah, drop both hands to the side. Take a couple of deep breaths, in and out, so you're nice and relaxed and just relax your shoulders. Actually, Sarah, come take a seat back here for me. Have a seat. Hold this hand-out for me. Sarah... I want you to imagine that the sentence you just read was actually a scene from a movie. And imagine that whatever's happening in the story at that point is actually happening all around you. OK. Look at me. Great. That's exactly what I needed, Sarah. Keep replaying that scene over and over in your mind. But this time, pay special attention to all of the sounds that you would hear around you. Now, close your eyes for me, please, Sarah, and listen carefully. Everybody in the room, I need you guys to help me out. If you're sat in this section here, do this... GENTLE SLAPPING That's perfect. Up top there, clicking your fingers together. CLICKING This section in the middle here, rub your hands like this. This section right in the middle, clicking your fingers together. Everybody up top, do this. This section here rubbing your hands like this. And this section on the floor here, clicking your fingers together. Everybody else, if you're not doing anything, just click your fingers together for me like this. GENTLE PATTERING OK, great, you can stop, thank you. Sarah, open your eyes. I believe that was the sound you had in your head. Yeah. Was you thinking of the sound of rain? Yes, I was. Thank you very much, everybody. APPLAUSE For the first time, can you tell us the page number? 158. 158, and you wrote it on your hand, right? Show everybody. So 158. Open the book again to 158, but this time read the sentence out loud. SHE GASPS You all right? Can't find it. What do you mean you can't find it? The page is not in here. Let's have a look. It's torn. Just stand up, I've got to show everyone this. She's right, look. Page 158 is no longer in the book. It's been torn out. I've got 156, 159. Maybe, Sarah, the page was never there to begin with. At the beginning of... LAUGHTER At the beginning of all of this, I gave Sarah a little green matchbox which you've been keeping safe this entire time. I don't know where it is. Oh, it's in your pocket there, right? Open it up. Is there something inside there? Mhm. Take it out. What is it, Sarah? No! LAUGHTER Is it page 158? Yeah. And does it fit right there in the book? It fits perfectly! Would you do one last thing for me, please, Sarah? Yeah. Just read the sentence out loud to everybody. "Suddenly, the heavens opened and the rain poured upon them." "Suddenly, the heavens opened and the rain poured upon them." THUNDER RUMBLES APPLAUSE CROWD GASP Now, we're very lucky to be here at the London Palladium tonight because this stage has played host to some truly legendary performers in its time. Harry Houdini... Peter Andre. LAUGHTER Frank Sinatra. Little Mix. Aretha Franklin. The Vengaboys. The Beatles. Mr Tumble. And we're very pleased to welcome another legend onto this stage. Joining the ranks of The Vengaboys and Mr Tumble, it's Rowan Atkinson! ORGAN MUSIC PLAYS WOLVES HOWL EVIL LAUGHTER CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Hello. CROWD: Hello. It's nice to see you all here. Now, as the more perceptive of you have probably realised by now, this is Hell. LAUGHTER And I am the Devil. Good evening. But you can call me Toby if you like, we try to keep things informal here. As well as infernal. That's just my little joke. LAUGHTER Now, you're all here for... eternity. Which I hardly need tell you is a heck of a long time. But I'm sure you'll all get to know each other pretty well by the end, but for now, I'm going to have to divide you up into groups. If that's OK? Can you hear me at the rack? LAUGHTER Well, if you'd stop screaming, that would help. OK, now, murderers. Murderers... Over here! LAUGHTER Over here, please. Thank you very much indeed. Looters and pillagers, over here, please. Thieves, if you could join us and lawyers, you're in that lot. If you'd like to come down there. Thank you very much indeed. APPLAUSE Ah, yes, there's plenty of room. If the hedge-fund managers will just move along a tiny bit? There we go. Fornicators, if you could step forward... My God, there are a lot of you. LAUGHTER You're down here, but first, if you could form a queue in front of that small guillotine in the corner there? Thank you very much indeed. The French, are you here? Parfait! And the Americans. Yes, look, I'm sorry about this, apparently God had a little falling out with your founding fathers and damned the entire nation in perpetuity. He sends particular condolences to the Mormons... LAUGHTER ..who he realises put in an awful lot of work. But never mind, if you'd just like to come down here, yes. If you'd just like to keep clear of that big space there we're reserving for a Mr... Trump. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Atheists. Atheists? PEOPLE WHOOP You must be feeling a right bunch of nitwits. Come down here, please. If you don't mind. Er... And everyone who saw Monty Python's Life of Brian. CHEERING I'm sorry, turns out God can't take a joke after all. There, there, there, there, there. Good. And Christians. Christians? Yes, I'm sorry, I'm afraid the Jews were right. LAUGHTER If you'd like to come here and form a line there, that would be lovely. Thank you very much indeed. Right, well, that's about it. Are there any questions? Er, yes? No, I'm afraid we don't have any toilets. I don't know if you read your Bible, but I'm afraid it's damnation without relief. If you didn't go before you came, then I'm afraid you're not going to enjoy yourself very much. But then I believe that's the idea. OK, well, look, I'll see you all later at the barbecue. LAUGHTER Or, rather, ON the barbecue. And, generally, I just hope that you all have a terrible time. Um, I'd like to leave you, actually, with another little joke of mine. I only know two jokes, informal, infernal and this one. And this joke goes like this, it is, "Knock, knock", "Who's there?" "Death." "Death wh-..." CHEERING AND APPLAUSE THUNDER CRACKS Still to come, Kylie Minogue. And Omid Djalili. It's not even a heckle, just a wistful reminder of a happier time. Now, it's time to introduce a very special guest to the stage, I'll give you a couple of clues. I can't get her out of my head... CHEERING Is it Kylie Minogue? We should be so lucky to have her here. It's Kylie Minogue! She'll have you spinning around. Makes no sense, but it's Kylie Minogue. Is she Australia's best pop star ever? I'm torn. No, that's... That's Natalie Imbruglia. But I assume you're still talking about Kylie Minogue. Have you guessed who I'm talking about? Yes, several times, it's Kylie Minogue. It's Kylie Minogue. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Good evening, everyone. Well, there's a very special reason were all here tonight and that's to celebrate the 70th birthday of His Royal Highness. Or to give him his full, official title, His Royal Highness, Prince Charles Philip Arthur George, Prince of Wales. KG, KT, GCB, OM, AK, QSO, CC, PC, ADC, Earl of Chester, Duke of Cornwall, Duke of Rothesay, Earl of Carrick, Baron of Renfrew, Lord of the Isles and Prince and Great Steward of Scotland. Phew! Do you mind if I just call you Charles? Thank you. Well, Sir, you're a philanthropist, an originator, a style icon, a passionate environmentalist with a relentless determination to get things done. And it gives me great pleasure to introduce this next film which takes a look at some of the truly wonderful things Your Royal Highness has achieved. Here's Gaby Roslin with the tale of our very own charming Prince. For seven decades, His Royal Highness Prince Charles Philip Arthur George has lived a life in the public spotlight. In 1969, the world watched as he was invested as the Prince of Wales at the tender age of 20. And it wasn't long before he became the world's most-eligible bachelor. By the time he was 27, he was commander of his very own ship, HMS Bronington. But still found time to be a champion polo player. Today, he's a global figurehead. You are the man. In 2018 alone, he made over 160 overseas engagements. You've even got the size right. Whilst moonlighting as an occasional weatherman. The potential for a few flurries over Balmoral... Who the hell wrote this script? ..as the afternoon goes on. And whether it's busting out some moves on the dance floor or being a global style icon, the Prince has never been afraid to use his profile to help others. It's a privilege to be on the course that helps with our communication skills, key life skills, things that we can really put into practice on the outside world. Even if it doesn't always work out. Dig that crazy rhythm! You have to keep ahead of the game. You need to be constantly thinking and aware of issues that are arising to try and make sure you're relevant. He's incredibly driven to do his duty and therefore, in effect, help so many people around him. He's constantly wanting to make the world a better place. Decades ago, his views on the environment were considered controversial. But now, many believe Prince Charles was ahead of his time. We cannot ignore the symptoms and should act now to restore the health of the planet. He's not doing it for his sake. He's doing it for everybody's sake, he's doing it for the next generation. For his commitment to preserving the future of the planet, Prince Charles has received over 25 awards. And he is president or patron of 423 charities. Which raise over £140 million annually. And make a positive change to millions of lives. Happy birthday! So happy birthday to the Prince of Wales, we can't wait to see what the future brings. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Very inspiring. OK, here's a man who actually performed at Prince Charles' 60th birthday. And he's back again tonight, ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together for comedian and break-out ethnic bit-part star of Mamma Mia 2, it's Omid Djalili. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE MUSIC: 'Dancing Queen' by ABBA Cut the music. Cut it now, thanks. Cut it, thank you. Cut it. CUT IT! It's great to be in a theatre because I've been practising this set for His Royal Highness in comedy clubs and I got the worst heckle I've ever had in my life above a pub in Willesden Green. I was trying out a new joke that got nothing and in the silence, in the corner, I audibly heard someone say, "There used to be a pool table in here." It's not even a heckle, just a wistful reminder of a happier time. But it's great to have an Iranian on the bill here. Now, people say, "Are you banging on about being an Iranian again?" It's not banging on about it, I'm reminded of it every day. I mean, literally, just yesterday, I went into a New York diner because I was attracted by the sign on the door that said, "We offer the authentic American experience." And they wouldn't let me in. Very realistic. Very realistic. And the travel ban is actually... Even if you have a British passport, if you have Iranian heritage, they won't let you in. I was invited to do the New York Comedy Festival and they didn't give me a work visa, I'm not kidding. They said just come anyway. At the time of heightened terror attacks, I arrived at JFK, they said, "Can you step forward, please, sir? "Can I have your passport?" I gave the passport. He says, "Could you put your fingers there?" I said, "Fine." And the guy looked through my passport and he goes, "Excuse me, sir, are you Iranian?" I said, "Er, yes, I'm ethnically Iranian, but I was born and raised in the UK. So, technically, that makes me Ukrainian. "Welcome to the United States, sir." Thank you very much. It's amazing. It was a wonderful moment. They told me not to talk about Brexit, but, you know, I have problems with authority and, erm... No, but Brexit is an amazing thing, it's so British. I love the fact that... See, Brexit to me, if we going to do it, we should... Next Olympics, we should do the Brexit 100m. The Brexit 100m, everyone lines up, the guy with the starter gun shoots himself in the foot. And that's it. That's it. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE I love the Britishness of Brexit. "Brexit means Brexit, we've made our decision, "we're going to get over it, we're going to move on." I love the stubborn Britishness of it. "We've made our decision." Well, we don't know what's going to happen. "We've made our decision." It could be a disaster. "We've made our decision." We could all die. "We've made our decision." And with all the lies that we heard, you know, it's... I don't want to do too many analogies, but it's a bit like going to a newsagent and asking for a Mars bar. And the newsagent gives you a Snickers bar, you think, "Oh, well, I'll eat the Snickers bar despite the fact that "I have a fatal nut allergy. "But I've made my decision." APPLAUSE I don't want to do too many analogies... I haven't got time for your applause. I don't want to do too many analogies, but it's like jumping out of a plane and your parachute doesn't open and you think, "Oh, my God, I'm going to die." But then your instructor says, "It's OK, you've got an emergency parachute, pull the string." "No, I've made my decision." "We'll move on at terminal velocity." I don't want to do too many analogies about this, but it's a bit like watching the first two minutes of The Kardashians and then deciding to continue watching. "Because I've made my decision!" But, Your Royal Highness, 70's a great age. I know when I got to 50, like most people, you start making noises. Do you ever make those noises? You know, like when you've dropped your phone you just kind of go... HE GROWLS HE STRAINS HE STRAINS HARDER You know what? I'll buy another one. But 70, it's not like 80. I've got two neighbours who are 80 years old. I didn't see them all summer and they arrived, they came back in September, they looked tanned, they got out of the car. I watched them arrive, she went in the house. I thought I'd help the old guy with the luggage and I said, "Hey, you look great, where have you been?" He said, "Oh, well, it was amazing, we were on holiday." I said, "Where did you go?" He went... HE MUTTERS "No, I know this, I know this. Definitely. "Could you help me out, Omid? "What's the name of that plant that grows on the side of the building?" I went, "Ivy?" He goes, "Yeah, Ivy. "Ivy, where did we go on holiday? I've completely forgotten." LAUGHTER Completely forgotten. You're not quite there yet, you're not there yet. But we respect you, Your Highness, because as that film showed, you believe in having a respect and reverence for nature. And I think that's marvellous at a time where we have to worry about the environment. I went to Clarence House to meet His Royal Highness, they said, "His Royal Highness, he's in the greenhouse." And I went there, and there he was, surrounded by the delphiniums and the begonias and the tulips and he was talking to them. He was talking to them. It is not a rumour, he was actually talking to them. And I felt so humble to watch him talk and I just said, "I don't mean to interrupt," and one of the delphiniums said, "Please do, for God's sake. "No clue what he's saying. "Years! No clue." It was a great moment. I'm very proud to be a Prince's Trust ambassador and in the summer, we met again, all the ambassadors got to meet His Royal Highness and we were all in the gardens at Clarence House and you can't meet everyone at the same time, we were put in little groups of people. I was in a little group and I said, "Who are these guys?" They said, "They're actors." I didn't recognise who they were. I saw some Hollywood A-listers, three of them, over there. And I said, "Who are they?" And they said, "They're another group of actors." I said, "Well, I suppose Ben Kingsley, "he's never done The Bill, you know, so he's not in my group." But I just walked over and I stood with the Hollywood A-listers. I thought, "This is where I belong." I just stood there, they looked at me and said, "Hello," like that. And then Prince Charles came over and he made a beeline for me, which meant a lot to me. He goes, "Yeah, are you still doing the comedy?" I said, "Yes, I am." He looked at the others and goes, "Have you seen his act?" And they all said, "We don't even know who he is." And I said, "That is the Prince of Wales." You see. I've got your back, baby. I've got your back. Your Royal Highness, thank you so much. Goodnight, thank you. Still to come, Penn and Teller. We do like to speak rather candidly about magic to our audiences. And Mischief Theatre. Why haven't any of you got normal jobs? Now, our next guests have changed the way we all view magic over the years. And have repeatedly raised the bar. Now, they've kindly taken a break from their Las Vegas show and flown all the way to the UK to perform here tonight. Please put your hands together for the legends that are Penn and Teller! CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Good evening from Penn and Teller and we are so excited to be in London. Very happy to be here. You know, we're big fans of Sherlock Holmes and we try when we can to use Sherlock Holmes' principles in our show. Like Sherlock and indeed Dr Watson, we like to use deduction and physical evidence. I love the deduction stuff and Teller loves the physical evidence stuff. So we're going to try to do a card trick using deduction and physical evidence. Xander, could you help us out here? Yeah. Alexander Armstrong! We're going to have you pick a card, but not just reach in, where I can do all sorts of manipulation. When you look at the cards, really think about them, OK? I'm going to fan them out to you and I'm going to try to get you to see all the faces, but try to think about what card you want to pick, look at them over, think about it. It's really important that you think about what card you want to pick and then reach in and grab a card that speaks to you, that means something to do. A card that means something to you. Pull it out of there. And then you can show it to the camera. We won't look. It'd be no fun if we did. There you go. Now, memorise it. Don't forget it. Don't forget it. And now, put it right back in the deck. And now, something you'll never see a magician do, you give the cards a shuffle. Give those a good shuffle. LAUGHTER Oh, give them that kind of shuffle. That's fine! LAUGHTER APPLAUSE And now, Teller will do the physical evidence... ..while I do the deduction. I told you to look through and pick one. There's some psychology going on here. I can deduce some things. Like, I did some research. I happen to know that you went to Trinity College, Cambridge, right? So I know that part of their slogan, their sign... ..roses, right? So just by doing that, thinking about that, I know that you indeed picked a red card. No. No. LAUGHTER You love music, don't you? Yeah. Well, the suit that looks the most like musical notes is spades. You have four children. Final answer, four of spades. No. LAUGHTER OK, deduction doesn't always work. But you looked through the cards. Now, Teller has been examining this, he's looked for your fingerprints, he's looked at everything and he thinks you picked the queen of spades. Is that right? No. Not right. LAUGHTER OK, well, deduction didn't work perfectly. Erm, evidence didn't work perfectly. He says the queen of spades. So we're going to try something else. We need somebody, somebody who has tremendous psychic mental powers. What we call in America a mentalist. Are there any mentalists in the audience? Any mentalists in the audience tonight who can help us here? I thought there was supposed to be a mentalist...? Oh, right there. I think there's some mentalists right there. Can you help us with this, please? Of course. I think you picked the ace of clubs. Was it the ace of clubs? That's it. That is my card. So, deduction... APPLAUSE Deduction, physical evidence and a little help from an old friend got us there in the end. Yes, this gentleman is actually one of the world's most revered mentalists. He's former President of the Magic Circle and 43 years ago witnessed the induction of a certain Prince of Wales into that very society. Please put your hands together for our incredible assistant Mr David Berglas! APPLAUSE Thank you, dude. We are not members of the Magic Circle. They will not let us in because we've been known to give away magic secrets. We do like to speak rather candidly about magic to our audiences and there is a term, a misdirection, that all lay people know, but it's originally a term of art in magic. The way lay people use the word misdirection, it's almost synonymous with distraction. People sometimes think misdirection is like, "Hey, look over there!" And then you do something sneaky over here. And the problem is that just doesn't work. If people know they're distracted, they just aren't fooled. What we mean by misdirection is almost a curating of attention, giving people a story that they naturally tell themselves that explains where their attention was every instant. Now, we're going to do a trick that uses misdirection for you here. And this trick is called the vanishing chicken. Now, when I say I'm going to give you a story to tell yourselves, I don't mean some jive story, like this is, you know, Captain Clunky McCluckface and she's going to blast off to Mars in a rocket ship shaped like a chicken coop. No, I mean a real story that's really natural and you tell yourselves without even thinking about it. You know it's a vanishing chicken. I've told you that. So I cover it up and you're thinking your to yourself, "Well, this is Penn and Teller, "we know they're going to do a magic trick," so your thoughts automatically cover the misdirection, because you've promised yourselves that at no time will you allow your attention... LAUGHTER APPLAUSE Misdirection. Now, I want to see how well this worked. Can I have the house lights up for a second, please? Oh, hi! I want to see a show of hands here. Now, how many of you saw the gorilla with the cymbals? It should be all of you! It's a gorilla with cymbals! LAUGHTER Now, a subset of that, how many of you saw Teller walk out, cop the chicken, and split? That's most of you, too. Now, here's where the misdirection comes in. During all of that, how many saw I sneaked the gorilla into the chicken coop right there? How many saw me doing that? Cos that's misdirection. Ladies and gentlemen, Ben Miller! LAUGHTER That was so good. I got to tell you, if you're ever in Vegas and you need work, give us a call. He's good! That's fighting talk. Ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together for the incredible Penn and Teller! CHEERING AND APPLAUSE And I must stress, no animals were harmed during that trick. Although, I have sweated half my body weight in this suit. LAUGHTER Now, Mr Penn, while I slip into something slightly less moist... LAUGHTER ..would you please be so kind as to introduce the next act? I sure will. Thank you. Ben Miller! APPLAUSE I'm so happy to introduce this next act. We spend a lot of time around London, we've see some amazing West End theatre shows, and the last time we were here we saw a show that absolutely blew our minds. A show called The Play That Goes Wrong. And... APPLAUSE We loved it so much, we felt compelled to get in touch with them and said, "Why don't we do a magic show together?" So we did. And it's called Magic Goes Wrong. So, for the very first time, we'd like to present an exclusive little piece of the show before it opens next year, performed by members of the fantastic Mischief Theatre. It's time to delve into the world of psyche with our magic and their madness. Please welcome the Mind-Mangler! CHEERING AND APPLAUSE I am the Mind-Mangler. Medal-winning master of the mind, mind, mind, mind... LAUGHTER I have a sense of taste, but it is a strange taste, for I can taste people's first names. LAUGHTER Gentleman here, please, nice and clearly for all the audience to hear, what is your name? Mark. Mark... LAUGHTER Are there any Johns in? LAUGHTER What, there's no Johns in? 2,000 people and not one John?! It's the most common name in the English... Anyone called John? LAUGHTER I'll take a Jonathan. Yes, you, sir. Your name is John? LAUGHTER Is your name John? I knew it. LAUGHTER This is not my only skill. LAUGHTER I also have a sense of smell, but it is a strange smell, for I can smell what your job is. Yes, I can. When you arrived here at the theatre this evening, you checked your coats and bags into the cloakroom by the box office. I was in that cloakroom. I smelt every one of those coats and all of those bags. And from that, I was able to determine what your professions are. As I detected them, I wrote them down and the time has come now for me to reveal them. Gentleman here, please, nice and clearly for all of us to hear, what is your job? I'm retired. You're retired... LAUGHTER First one out of the gate, and you don't have a job. LAUGHTER Thank you for helping me with this section. That's why I wrote down... ..when I smelt your coat that you are old. LAUGHTER Anyone here have a job? What's your job? I'm a director. You're a director? That's generic, isn't it? What kind of a director? I run a marketing company. You run a marketing company? Very good. Absolutely. That's why I wrote down that you work indoors. LAUGHTER The lady here, please, what's your job? PR. PR? What kind of PR? You work for his company, do you? No. What kind of PR do you do? Champagne. Champagne PR? LAUGHTER What an insanely niche market. LAUGHTER Just champagne PR, just luxury champagne PR? That's why I wrote down that you have a vague job. LAUGHTER Why haven't any of you got normal jobs?! LAUGHTER You, what's your job? A maze marshal. You're a maze marshal? LAUGHTER LAUGHTER CONTINUES You're a maze...? Is that right? You marshal mazes? That's unbelievable. There can't be ten of those in the country! How have I stumbled across the one maze marshal? You marshal a maze. I'm surprised you've found your way here! LAUGHTER That's why I wrote down your job is ridiculous. LAUGHTER This is not my only skill. I also have a sense of hearing, but it is a strange hearing, for I can hear the thoughts of playing cards. I hear them in my mind, mind, mind, mind.... LAUGHTER In this next experiment, I need a member of the audience to come up and join me on stage. A member of the audience. Who would like to volunteer? Anyone? LAUGHTER Anyone?! Oh, me, yes! You, sir! Thank you very much. Give him a big hand as he comes up and joins me on the stage. APPLAUSE Thank you very much. Thank you, sir. Thank you very much. Thank you. Now, can you please confirm we have never met before? No. We do not live together. That's... LAUGHTER LAUGHTER What a strange thing to say. Now... LAUGHTER What's your name? Steve. Steve, right. No, Brian, isn't it? We said Brian. Brian. Thank you, Brian. LAUGHTER I'm a maze marshal. Thank you, Brian. LAUGHTER Now... Think of a card. The three of clubs. No. LAUGHTER Think of a card. Don't say it out loud. HE WHISPERS: The three of clubs. LAUGHTER No, think of a card in your mind, mind, mind, mind... Not that one! LAUGHTER Think of a card, not the three of clubs, that won't work. Why? Because you've told me what it is. Think of a different card. the four of clubs. Don't say it out loud! Don't say it out loud, right? Think of a card. In my brain? If you have one. Not the three of clubs, not the four of clubs, and don't say it, right? Right. Right. MAN: The five of clubs. Not the five of clubs, please! It was! It was the five of clubs! It wasn't the five clubs! He's proper good, he is! He's not good! He's better than you are. He's not better than me! Of course he is! He's not better than me! You haven't done nothing! I think it's very easy, yeah? Yeah, watch. You, what's your job? Sha-na-na-nana... Prince of Wales. Right, next! LAUGHTER I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. APPLAUSE Look, I'm the Mind-Mangler. Oh, fine. Oh, right, so you all think this is easy, do you? They all do, yeah. You all think this is easy? All right... WOMAN: Yes! What do you mean, yes?! OK, what's your name? Rachel. All right, Rachel, fine. If it's so easy, why don't you have a go? I'm going to think of a number. A number between one and ten, Rachel. Why don't you tell me what number I'm thinking of? Come on. Six. Six? All right, well, that time it was six, yes, but... LAUGHTER All right, maze marshal, what's your name? John. John?! Why didn't you say that in the first place?! LAUGHTER I was looking for a John at the beginning, wasn't I? OK, fine, all right. All right, all right... All right, I'm thinking of a city. What do you mean, you didn't hear? All right, I'm thinking of the city. All right, go on, John. If it's so easy, John... All right, if it's so easy, why don't you tell me? Come on, what city am I thinking of? Berlin. Berlin? All right, well, again, you got lucky. You got lucky. All right, fine. Just keep your cool, mate. I am keeping my cool! Right, let's try another one. Give me the chalkboard. All right, fine. Please. All right, OK, fine. Here, all right. You, what's your name? Anya. Anya? All right, fine, I knew it. OK, fine, Anya. LAUGHTER I'm going to think of a colour, OK? And if it's so easy to read minds, mind, mind, mind... Not now, please! LAUGHTER If it's so easy to read minds, mind, mind, mind... Stop it! LAUGHTER If it's so easy to read... thoughts, then why don't you tell me what colour have I written down? Maroon. Maroon? LAUGHTER How did you know that?! CHEERING AND APPLAUSE For God's sake, go home! Mate, just calm down! APPLAUSE CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Still to come, two old friends... Yeah, and I, like, totally did the fly-past over Buck Palace. Like, actually shut up! And Jim Carter... I just heard here on the stage tonight there is a member of the Magic Circle, which amazed me. I tell you what, bruv, I, like, totally made up the whizz of the theatre. It's like, sick, man. Yeah, going theatre's swag. Cos theatre's like, you know, TV or something or whatever, except it's all, like, in 3-D cos, like, actual things can come out in your face. And you, like, actually smell things which makes it foodie. Yes, sorry about that, man. I had a Scotch egg for lunch. LAUGHTER There is a line, bruv. Isn't it? Isn't it, though. So, my nan reckons this is like a birthday party. But how come, yeah? Cos we're, like, in a theatre and isn't a birthday party supposed to be in a house or a Laser Quest or an ice cream shop? Yeah, this is, like, Charlie's party. What Charlie? Charlie from the Windsor crew. What? LAUGHTER What, the one who used to be all in the RAF and flying them planes, like what we does? Yes. The man's boss. LAUGHTER I heard he's so skilled he flew his plane through Windsor Castle and didn't touch the sides and I'm not even lying or nothing. You can ask Kevin cos Kevin knows Tina and Tina's sister saw it. LAUGHTER The man's well boss. I heard he was the first Royal to do a parachute jump. You know, you fall out of a plane and instead of dying, you, like, live. LAUGHTER And he didn't hit a tree or a rock or a cow or anything. Legend. Standard. Remember, like, when he was born? What, like as an actual baby? But remember, like, when he was born? Like an actual baby? Yeah, like an actual baby. That day was proper wicked. The man had a well epic street party - cake, hats, gin, juice. Yeah, and I, like, totally did the fly-past over Buck Palace. Like, actually shut up. LAUGHTER You done the fly-past, you're serious, bruv? Totally serious. The King asked me and the RAF to fly over his crib and do some stunts or this or that or whatever. So I gets in the Spitfire, yeah, and I'm all, like, doing looperty loops and upside-down swagger with smoke and ting coming out the back. LAUGHTER What colour smoke, bruv? British colour. That's well gangsta. That's what the King said. He was like, "Oh, my days! That's well gangsta!" LAUGHTER But get this, he didn't even not give me no knighthood nor nothing. LAUGHTER That's, like, well prejudiced. You should, like, totally complain. He'd be well sacked. Isn't it? Isn't it, though? #HumanRights. LAUGHTER So, er... So, who's next? Cheryl. From school? Cheryl from geography field trip, who got wet in a rock pool and you could, like, totally see her bra strap and Tommy said he got a picture, but he never lets anyone see it. No, no, this is, like, a different Cheryl. You know, from the wireless and the music halls. Oh, Cheryl the multi-award-winning singer and all-round national treasure from the peng band Girls Aloud? Yeah, that Cheryl. Ladies and gentlemen, let's go cray, cray for Cheryl. Not from school! CHEERING AND APPLAUSE I'm here to talk about the Prince's Trust. In 1976, his Royal Highness the Prince of Wales had a bold idea. Having completed his duty in the Royal Navy, he became dedicated to improving the lives of disadvantaged young people in the UK. He founded his trust to deliver on that commitment. Who could have imagined that, 40 years on, the Prince's Trust would become such an important part of society? I have been so inspired by the work of the Prince's Trust that I've been raising funds for a Prince's Trust and a Cheryl's Trust centre in my own home town. I couldn't be happier that my centre in Newcastle is now open and we're helping hundreds of local young people get the support they need from this amazing charity. Here to tell more... APPLAUSE ..about the incredible work they do is Prince's Trust ambassador Jon Snow. I was a teenager, up to no good all the time. I was shot nine times. Throughout my life, I have suffered with psychotic depression. I lost full sight in my left eye. Environments I'm not familiar with would be a struggle. The Prince's Trust put me on to their enterprise programme, they helped me learn the ins and the outs of running a business. Relying on charitable donations from the public, the Prince's Trust is committed to helping disadvantaged youngsters into employment, training or education. You all have a job! Young people, from whatever background, should have an opportunity to fulfil their potential. But particularly those from disadvantaged circumstances. The Prince's Trust referred me to the Fairbridge Programme where you meet a bunch of new people, build your confidence doing lots of different activities. The Prince's Trust evolved over time into what it is now, which is this incredible charity that has bust every possible limit it was ever set. Individuals who were literally rock-bottom, and you give them just a little glimmer of hope and then, suddenly, they flourish. It changed my life. It gave me the confidence to leave my house, it gave me friends, it enabled me to get back into college and I recently got accepted to the University of West London for mental health nursing. If it wasn't for the Prince's Trust, I don't know where I would be. It gave me more confidence to do things. The Prince's Trust gave me some money to go to the National Youth Music Theatre. And if I hadn't got that money, I probably wouldn't be standing here today. Since it began, the Prince's Trust has helped over 900,000 young people across the UK. And now, it's branching out to support youngsters across the world. I'd just like to say thank you to the Prince's Trust. I was thinking about who I was and who I used to be. For more information on how the charity helps our young people, please go to... And on behalf of everyone the trust has helped, happy birthday to the Prince of Wales. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE What an incredible charity. Time now to welcome to the stage another very special guest. Fresh off the set of the Downton Abbey movie, where he plays everyone's favourite butler, ladies and gentlemen, it's Jim Carter! CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Tonight, I've been given the distinct privilege of saying a few words about someone who I think I can get away with referring to as the birthday boy. LAUGHTER As a fellow septuagenarian, I'd like to take a moment to recognise the impact that this incredible individual has had on so many lives over the last 70 years. His enthusiasm, his energy are truly infectious. And not content with the lasting legacy that he's already created, he continues to work tirelessly for the betterment of others. And tonight, I just heard on the stage that he's a member of the Magic Circle. Which amazed me. Yay! I've no idea where he finds the time. Ladies and gentlemen, I am of course talking about... Sooty! CHEERING SOOTY SQUEAKS 'HAPPY BIRTHDAY' Speech! Speech! Speech! Don't worry, Sooty, I'll do it for you. Now, Sooty, has been at the centre of British life for the past seven decades and, despite his superstardom, he remains modest to this very day, preferring to communicate by whispering in the ear of his best friend Sue. SOOTY SQUEAKS Sorry, Sweep, apologies. Yes, I'm going to introduce you as well. SWEEP SQUEAKS THEY BOTH SQUEAK Sweep, Sweep, language please! Royalty's present. LAUGHTER But... LAUGHTER But Sooty does of course share his birthday with someone he holds very dear, the Prince of Wales. And while not many people know this, they've quite literally grown up with each other. Let's take a look at their 70 years together... # Oh, you're my best friend... # LAUGHTER Ever since he was a baby, his Royal Highness has been inseparable from his favourite furry friend, Sooty. LAUGHTER And it was in the early years that they both fell in love with magic. So, here is Prince Charles with Sooty and their glamorous assistant Princess Anne rehearsing their disappearing pram illusion. Sadly, the Incredible Windsors didn't make it past round one of Britain's Got Talent. LAUGHTER Now, age and time only served to strengthen the bond between the Prince and his pint-sized pal and as Charles's military career blossomed, so did Sooty's. Here we see Sooty with the Prince when he was a lieutenant in the Royal Navy abroad HMS Bronington. You can't tell in this photograph that Sooty is seasick because it's in black and white but, actually, he's a disgusting shade of green. SWEEP SQUEAKS WITH LAUGHTER In recent years, both his Royal Highness and Sooty have enjoyed spectator sports together... ..with Royal Ascot being an annual awayday alongside the Duchess of Cornwall. And after a lifetime together... LAUGHTER ..they continue to enjoy each other's company. And I'm extremely honoured to be here with you tonight and to wish you both a very happy 70th birthday. Ladies and gentlemen, Prince Charles and Sooty! CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Still to come... Alistair McGowan. Dara O Briain said, "Er..." And the Ehrlich Brothers. But this is nice, isn't it? Back together again. I know. It's been too long. Not that it feels like we've been apart. You know, you're never off the telly. Well, you know, I dabble. Well, it's more than dabbling. What's that thing you do? It's Pointless. Don't do yourself down. I enjoy your singing. LAUGHTER No, as you very well know, the TV programme is Pointless. Your words, not mine. LAUGHTER Now for one of my comedy heroes, here with some messages from people who can't be here tonight, please welcome Alistair McGowan! APPLAUSE Thank you! Thank you very much, everybody. Good evening, Your Royal Highness. Yes, I have some messages from people who sadly couldn't be here on the stage with us tonight. Piers Morgan has tweeted... AS PIERS MORGAN: I can't be there. I've got to be up very early in the morning to do Good Morning Britain and annoy Susanna Reid and most of the entire nation, so... LAUGHTER ..no late nights for me these days. #LuckyYou. LAUGHTER Frank Skinner sent his apologies. AS FRANK SKINNER: Happy birthday, sir. A winter birthday as well. And I have to say, actually... LAUGHTER ..I love the winter. I really do. Although, last November, I actually went to call on a mate of mine and when I rang his doorbell I had to put on a pair of gloves and a scarf because a note on the door said, "No cold callers." Anyway... LAUGHTER Boris Johnson. SOME OF THE AUDIENCE BOO LAUGHTER AS BORIS JOHNSON: Well, you know, look, come on, you know, erm... when I received the invitation, you know, and let me be absolutely clear about this, when I first received the invitation, I was fully behind it. I was fully behind it. But by Monday... LAUGHTER You know... CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Professor Brian Cox was very upset not to be here. AS BRIAN COX: I may be an expert on the physics of the universe and an authority on the very nature... LAUGHTER ..of time itself, but I wrote the date down wrong in my diary. LAUGHTER Sir Patrick Stewart said... AS PATRICK STEWART: I'm washing my hair that night. LAUGHTER Dara O Briain said... AS DARA O BRIAIN: Er... Er, er... Blaa, blaa, er... No. LAUGHTER And Simon Cowell just said... AS SIMON COWELL: No. Just no. LAUGHTER Which I think is a bit rude. One final message, sir, from me. Congratulations on 49 years as the Prince of Wales. Although, I have to say, in all that time, to my knowledge, sir, you've never once tried to be Welsh. LAUGHTER Now, if I'd been the Prince of Wales for 49 years, I think, just once, I'd have wanted to turn up somewhere and go... AS THE PRINCE OF WALES: Well, obviously, I'm absolutely delighted to be here today to, erm... to open this, erm... IN WELSH ACCENT: ..this here hospital. LAUGHTER And I've had a bit of a look around, like, and I've got to say it's bloody lush here, innit, eh? I tell you. AS HIMSELF: Thank you very much, goodnight! Thank you! CHEERING AND APPLAUSE OK, time now to enjoy one of Germany's best exports. I have to say what you're about to see is absolutely extraordinary. Please welcome for their first-ever UK performance, just sneaking in before the borders close, it's the Ehrlich Brothers! # Why # Why can't this moment Last for evermore? # We sail into infinity # No # Don't ever stop Doing the things you do # Don't go # In every breath I take I'm breathing you # Euphoria # From now on, only you and I # Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh # Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh # Euphoria # We're going u-u-u-u-u-u-up. # CHEERING AND APPLAUSE MOTORBIKE ENGINE REVS APPLAUSE Thank you very, very much for your warm welcome. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. We are the Ehrlich Brothers from Germany. And we feel very honoured to be tonight here with you in the Palladium. Yeah, we'd like to tell you how we actually got into magic for the first time. It all started at Christmas. Yeah, I wished for a sister. And then I got him! Shut up. At least he looks like a sister. LAUGHTER Shut up. No, no, just kidding. On that Christmas, we got exactly, exactly what we had put on our wish list. It was a wooden sled with craft runners. Oh, we just loved it. And every day, we went outside and played on it. But unfortunately, it was a winter without any snow. Our mum took a picture of it. That's what it looked like. No snow. Just molehills. The only snow we saw that winter was Mum and Dad's snow globe. And that was the very first time in our lives we really wanted to be able to do... ..magic. May each snowflake turn into a magic moment in your life. APPLAUSE CHEERING AND APPLAUSE APPLAUSE Thank you very much! Thank you! APPLAUSE Still to come, Bill Bailey... There was a fellow there, he was doing a falconry demonstration and he said to me, "A lot of them don't come back." LAUGHTER HE WHISTLES Just before we bring on our incredible final act, sir, we'd like, if we may, to read out a few birthday cards that have been sent in. This one's very cute, sir. It's got a unicorn on it and it says, "May your day be full of rainbows, cupcakes and sparkles." Who is that from? The Royal Marines. LAUGHTER This one... It's lovely, look. It's got a birthday cake there was some candles in and some stars, all wax crayon. Oh, that's lovely. Is that from little Prince George? Donald Trump, no. LAUGHTER Joined-up writing, too. LAUGHTER Now, this is the last one. So this is from the Tower of London. For your birthday, they want to put the crown jewels on open-air display. A bit nippy for that. LAUGHTER It's like talking to a brick wall. The line, Xander. Remember the line. Look, they're talking about the orbs and sceptre. So am I. It's off the line! LAUGHTER I can't apologise enough, sir. Let's just push on with the grand finale, and we promise you this is going to be a real treat. Now, he normally hails from just down the road in Hammersmith but tonight, he's flown all the way from Australia where he is currently on his world tour. Ladies and gentlemen, it gives us immense pleasure to welcome to the stage comedian and musical genius Bill Bailey! CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Hello. Good evening, everyone. And good evening, er... LAUGHTER I'm Bill Bailey, I'm from the West of England, the West Country. And I don't have the accent any more because I wanted to get on in life. LAUGHTER You don't see people in positions of power or influence with a West Country accent, do you? IN ACCENT: "Hello, there..." You just, you know, you don't take them seriously. If somebody fainted in the street and you said, IN ACCENT: "Here, let me through, I'm a doctor." LAUGHTER People would just laugh in your face. "No, you're not." IN ACCENT: "I flipping well am! "I've got a certificate and everything!" "That's just a book of Pam Ayres poems, you wurzle." LAUGHTER I like the West Country, though. Don't get me wrong. I mean, it's where I grew up. I was filming down there in Devon. I went to a West Country wildlife park and it's quite different down there, they do things in a different way. It's quite relaxed, you know. And there was no signs on any of the animal enclosures. You know, "What's in there?" "Well, I don't know. "Could be a Mongolian red panda or a cat or something, I don't know." LAUGHTER "They're all in together?" "Yeah, we just chuck them all in together. "Lemurs, wallabies, crabs, gazelles. They all seem to get on." "What do you feed them?" "We just chuck a big bag of Quavers in "and they all seem to get on with that." LAUGHTER There was a fellow there, he was doing a falconry demonstration. He said to me, "A lot of them don't come back." LAUGHTER HE WHISTLES "That's another one gone down. We've lost another one. "Bring the ostrich out and the big glove!" LAUGHTER Anyway, it's a great pleasure to be here. Yeah, I am from West London. They did mention briefly I'm from West London. West London, yeah. When people talk like that, the young people, when they're making a point, they point a little bit to the side. They don't point forwards, like in the old way. "Well, that's a very good point well made." No, they talk to the side. "Yeah, that's it, when I'm making a point, "I point adjacent to the finger I'm actually pointing it at. "Like that, yeah?" I feel sorry for them. I reckon a lot of them must get the wrong cheese in delis... LAUGHTER ..on a regular basis. "Yeah, some of that, yeah?" LAUGHTER "No, no, not the Wensleydale low-fat with chive!" LAUGHTER "Port Salut, man! "I'm gonna have to stand a little bit to the side. "Some of that, yeah?" LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE Thank you very much. Now... I've always preferred the minor key. Scales, the building blocks of music. HE PLAYS A SCALE The minor scales are much more evocative. The beautiful melodic minor. HE PLAYS A MINOR SCALE The hopeful accent, the depressing decent. # Things are looking happy and joyful # No, they're not, they're depressing and bleak. # LAUGHTER The harmonic minor with that little Indian raga at the end. HE ASCENDS A SCALE HE LINGERS ON A RAGA THEME It's impossible to play that without playing this... HE ASCENDS A SCALE SCALE BECOMES A RAGA THEME LAUGHTER HE STOPS PLAYING APPLAUSE The minor key is so much more evocative. The major key, too eager to please. # Like me, like me, like me, like me, I'm a major key. # No, back off. LAUGHTER I prefer the minor key. Some of the world's great classical music is written in the minor key, like Fur Elise. HE PLAYS FUR ELISE But in the major key, it doesn't work, does it? FUR ELISE IN A JOLLY MAJOR KEY LAUGHTER It just sounds like a... APPLAUSE ..Bavarian milking song. Now, some of the great national anthems are written in a major key. In fact, most national anthems are in a major key, celebratory, uplifting. I'd like to experiment with them and play them in a different key. And the one I'm thinking of is The Star-Spangled Banner, the American national anthem, which I think is appropriately now, I think it should be played in the minor key. It... It takes on a totally different dynamic. STAR-SPANGLED BANNER IN A MINOR KEY It actually makes it sound a bit Russian. APPLAUSE APPLAUSE I'd like to play for you now one of my favourite hymns, a lovely old song, Jerusalem. Now, Jerusalem is a great tune. And the mark of any great tune is that you can play it in all different ways. And I'd like to play it in many, many different ways tonight. We'll be experimenting with virtual instruments, real instruments, one of these, which is a theremin, you play it by moving any part of your body in. ELECTRONIC SOUND There you go. Actually, I don't know if any of you have noticed, the opening stanzas of Jerusalem sound a bit like Fats Domino's Blueberry Hill. BLUES VERSION OF JERUSALEM LAUGHTER # And was the holy Lamb of God # On England's pleasant pastures seen? DING! # And did the countenance divine # Shine forth upon our clouded hills? # And was Jerusalem builded here # Among those dark Satanic Mills? # Bring me my bow of burning gold! # Bring me my arrows of desire! # Bring me my spear! # O clouds, unfold! # Bring me my chariot of fire! CHANGES TO MUSIC HALL RHYTHM # I will not cease from mental fight # Nor shall my sword sleep in my hand # Till we have built Jerusalem # In England's green and pleasant land. # CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Thank you very much! Jerusalem, as you probably never heard it before. So... It's really hard playing those bells. So, now... LAUGHTER ..I'd like to finish up by sending you off into the balmy London air with a little folk song. This is a little folk reel of my own composition. And I'll be employing the live looping skills, as employed by Ed Sheeran. So, in your face! LAUGHTER Here we go. THE TUNE REPEATS ITSELF APPLAUSE THE TUNE BECOMES MORE COMPLEX TEMPO INCREASES DRAMATICALLY CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Ladies and gentlemen, Bill Bailey! CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Thank you, Bill. And a huge thank you to everyone here on stage who have given their time in aid of the Prince's Trust. Thank you very much, everyone. Thank you. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE And a final thanks of the night must go to their Royal Highnesses, the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall! CHEERING AND APPLAUSE CHEERING Ladies and gentlemen, please join us in giving three hearty cheers for his Royal Highness the Prince of Wales! Hip-hip... Hurray! APPLAUSE After the performance, their Royal Highnesses joined the members of the cast on stage, where they met the creators of tonight's Wallace and Gromit film, Merlin Crossingham and Nick Park. Next is Rebecca Bernice Amissah and the cast of the Mind-Mangler. Followed by Penn and Teller. Then Cheryl, Dynamo and Sandi Toksvig. Before moving on to Bill Bailey and Rowan Atkinson. Next is Kylie Minogue and Alistair McGowan. Followed by Omid Djalili, Sooty and Sweep and Jim Carter. Then the Ehrlich Brothers. Clinton Jordan, conductor of the Kingdom Choir. Opera singer Florence Hvorostovsky. And finally, the Prince meets Ben Miller and Alexander Armstrong. We hope you've been truly amused and amazed.
