(camera beeping) (footsteps crunching) - [Jess] Are you ready? - [Brad] Almost. - [Jess] What're you looking at? - Everything. Isn't it beautiful? - [Jess] I miss the city. - That's not an option anymore, is it? - [Jess] Come on, let's head back. We need to check on her. (Brad sighing) - Yeah, I'm ready. - Doesn't make me any less intelligent. On the contrary, I like to I'm adding to a non-rigid perspective, especially when it comes to my forte of computers. And subsequently, I have become one of the best programmers in the world, maybe except for Ed, Ed's probably just a step above me, yeah, he probably is. - [Brad] Alex, who the fuck is Ed? - Dude, Snowden, join the conversation, come on. - [Brad] Uh, fucking traitor. (Jess speaking muffled) (Brad sighing) - Dude, close the door, it's cold. - [Brad] No, Alex, if you're cold, put a sweater on or wear a blanket. - Oh, okay, you know what, I see what's goin' on here. Gang up on the luminary of the group. Nice, pretty rich, all right, perfect, perfect timing. Give me that thing. - Knock yourself out. - Let's put you guys on blast. Where we at? All right, perfect. So, first we have the lovely, the beautiful, the demoness in the sack, my girlfriend Jessica who, and I love you babe, but someone who spent years in medical school only to hate her job. - Hey, hate is a strong word, okay? I prefer strongly dislike. - [Alex] (chuckling) Fair enough, fair enough. And then, there's this guy, mm. For those who don't know him, Bradley graduated with his masters in psychology. Now, did he go on to open up his own private practice making the big bucks, treatin' high-end clientele? (imitates buzzing) Perhaps he's paving his way into fascinating new research. Oh, no, no, no, no, ladies and gentlemen, my best friend shot for the stars with his education-backed occupation, drum roll please (imitating drum roll), he became a bar manager. (laughing) That's right ladies and gentlemen, a bar manager. So if either of you two wanna correlate education with anything, let's talk about education and quality of life, boom, suck it! Mind blown, these pills are amazing! Uh, I feel so good right now. Thank you, thank you, thank you. - You're so cute when you try to stick up for yourself. - I know, I know, mm. - [Brad] All right, hey, knock it off, knock it off. - Why, you jealous? - [Brad] Jess, check on her. - No, no, no, she's fine, all right. If you're so worried about her, you go check on her yourself. - [Brad] Jess, check on her. Alex, do everyone in the room a favor, keep your voice down. - My voice down, dude, she's been out cold for days. I could literally yell at the top of my lungs-- - Please don't. - Hey-o! And she's never gonna wake up. - Guys, guys. - What, what? - She's waking up. - [Brad] Goddammit, Alex. - [Alex] Yep, thanks. - (groaning) What's going on? - All right. - [Alex] Whoa, try to be calm, try to be calm. - Where am I? - [Jess] You were in an accident, okay? - Oh, what? - I know this all must be very confusing, okay, but you're safe, I promise. - [Jess] What's your name? - My name is Lily. - Lily? - Yeah. Who, who are you? - [Alex] I'm Alex, that's Brad, and that's Jess. - Uh, (groaning) ouch, my head. - Alex, go get her some water. - [Alex] All right. - Try to relax, okay? I'm, I'm, I was a nurse. I was a nurse. I'm trained. - [Brad] Lily? - All right, I got the water. Ah, shit. Well that went anticlimactic. - [Jess] Alex, really? - What, the pills give me cotton mouth and she's out cold again so, I'm gonna go take a nap. - Uh? - [Brad] Is she gonna be okay? - Yeah. Yeah, I think so. Someone needs to stay with her till she wakes up again. - [Brad] Okay, I will, I'll watch over her. - Okay. (camera beeping) - [Brad] Ah, smells good. Hey, guys, remind me to check the propane tank a little later, okay? - Yeah, will do. - [Brad] Is that-- - Hey! - Oh, all right. - No grazing until it's all done. - Hey man, run and do me favor, grab my map that's upstairs in our room. I wanna start planning the next run. - [Brad] Yeah, wait, planning something, you wanna plan? Did you take your concentration pill? - Help, help! - Guys, guys, she's getting up. - Oh my god. - [Lily] Help. (groaning) Everyone, stay the fuck back! - Oh Jesus, okay. - Oh, no, no, the anger towards us is not necessary, all right? You're not in any danger here. I mean, don't you think if we wanted to hurt you we would've done it already? - I mean, yeah, we're actually trying to help you. Hence the bandages and IV. - Oh, what's going on? Where am I? (breathing heavily) - Lily, right? Right? Okay, my name's Jessica. Do you remember waking up yesterday? - Yes. (panting) - [Jess] What do you remember? - Uh, I remember something about an accident, and then I, I don't remember anything else after that. I said stay back! - Yo, okay, okay. - [Alex] Careful with the camera dude, it's expensive. - Look, you can, oh god, you can put the poker down, okay. We are not here to hurt you. - (breathing heavily) What did you do to me? Why do I feel funny? Did you drug me? - [Brad] What is going on with her? - Lily, we didn't do anything to you. - I don't believe you. What was in that IV bag? - Mostly water, okay, with a small amount of salt and sugar. Nothing more, you can check the bag if you don't believe me. - Then, then why, why do I-- - Feel tired? Nauseous and weak? Okay, it's just your body. That, coupled with the accident, your body's just recovering, it need nutrients. - Look, we get it, waking up in a strange place full of strangers, probably have like a million questions and (inhaling) oh shit, the bacon's burning! - I got it. I, I got it. - Jess, Jess go ahead, get it. - Oh, it can't get any worse. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, now look. Hey, I have a suggestion, all right. Why don't we all go sit at the table, have some breakfast, answer all of your questions all right? If I'm being completely honest, this is the last of our bacon, and nobody likes cold bacon, like maybe on a BLT or something like that, but still-- - Look, seriously, Alex, enough with the bacon, look, (sighing) you need food, okay, you need nutrients. You haven't eaten in a long time. - No tricks, just treats. Delicious breakfast-y treats, okay? - [Brad] Exactly, just, you can bring the poker if you want to, okay, if it makes you feel safer. Just come on, let's eat some food. (Lily groaning) Jess, can you take that? - [Jess] Yeah, yeah. - Yeah, you need to eat, take my plate. (Lily panting) Okay, there you go, here's some bacon. - [Jess] Here, here's my water, Lily. - (panting) Okay, someone better start talking. You promised me answers. - [Alex] That we did, what do you wanna know? - Where am I? - This is my uncle's hunting cabin. - Why did you kidnap me? - [Jess] We didn't kidnap you. - [Alex] Well. - [Jess] Okay, all right, I mean, technically we did, but we did it to save you. - Save me, from what? - [Alex] Help yourself. - You, you really don't remember? - No, I, I, I don't, I, I, last thing I remember was, I mean, my routine is the same. I wake up, I take a shower, I eat breakfast, I put my headphones in and I ride my bike to work. - Damn. - That's it. - Where do we begin? - Start from the beginning. - Hey, turn the sass down a notch, all right. Just give me a second, let me think. I guess it um, I was picking up Jess from her shift at the hospital, that's about when it happened. - When what happened? - [Jess] The explosions. - It was a terrorist attack. There were calculated explosions around the city and, they were incredibly loud, and they were incredibly devastating. - [Alex] None of this is stirring a memory? - No. - [Alex] Here babe, let me take that, get some food. - [Jess] All right. - Go. - What? Terrorist attack? - The news report said it was ISIS, or one of those damn jihadists groups. Whoever it was, they set up calculated explosions all over the U.S. - I, I, don't, I don't believe you. I, that, that didn't happen. - Lily, I know this is a lot, okay, but unfortunately, this, this is the reality that we live in. I mean, luckily, we were outside the blast radius when it went off. - [Alex] And don't forget about upwind, otherwise we'd all be glowing a nice shade of green right about now. - Glowing green, what? - [Alex] You know, radiation poisoning. - Dirty bombs, the news reports call them. - Okay, now even if I believe all that, I don't understand why I'm here. - Right, uh well, Alex and Jess were on their way back to the apartment. I was closing up the bar, heading back to the house so I could take a shower and, that's when it happened, the first of the explosions. I mean it was like, it felt like an earthquake. And the next thing I know, Alex is literally kicking down the front door. - [Alex] My keys were still in the car. - Well, I mean, he was, he was insane. He was grabbing, he was telling me to grab food, he was telling me to grab the bag, the camera, he got the clothes-- - Insane, dude, even if that's the case, you would've acted the exact same way, we both know it. - Mm, I don't know about that but, I'm just, I'm not giving you shit, I just, look, Lily it, everything happened so fast. I mean, that's when Jess saw it. - I was waiting in the car and I saw it all go down. - Saw what, exactly? - You really, you really don't remember? I was so scared, so nervous, looking all around, honking the horn for Alex to hurry up and, and then I looked out in an intersection and I saw a girl riding her bike in the bike lane. - It was you, Lily. I mean, some guy must've ran a red and hit you. - [Alex] Coming out of the apartment I watched your body fly through the air. Helmet or not, I thought for sure you were gone. - It was, he didn't even stop. He didn't even stop to see if you were okay. He just, he just, he just kept going. - So I ran over to check on you. I mean, your vitals were low, you were in bad shape, but you were still breathing so, I mean, we figured with the accident there was no way an ambulance would come to get you but-- - Why are you laughing? - So we took you in our car. What? - [Alex] Okay, look, no offense, but I just gotta say, it is spot on when they talk about people getting hit by cars and their shoes flying off. (Alex laughing) - Alex, really, it's not the time. - [Alex] Well, she's fine, it's okay. I mean, we have your shoes too. - Thanks. Look, thank you guys for what you've done for me, I'm very appreciative, but why didn't you take me to a hospital? - Oh, oh, can you just, can you guys just tell her? Excuse me. - Jess, come, Jess. - No, it's fine, it's fine. - Are you sure? (Alex sighing) Dammit, all right. - What, what, was it something I said, what, what's wrong? - No, no, no, it's, it's fine, it's not, it's not you, it's just (sighing) the hospital was one of the targets. And, Jess's friends, the ones that were on shift at the hospital she worked at, they, there's no way that they made it. - [Alex] Those fuckhead terrorists targeted the perfect spots, hospitals, schools, basically the whole downtown and some. - I swear to god, I swear to god, if I ever get my hands on one of those terrorists, I'd-- - [Alex] I know. - I, I, I just did, that's not all. - What do you mean? - [Alex] See, nobody knew it at the time, and I guess, you know, looking back, how could they have, but explosions, that was just the opening act. Real hell, that pure evil, yeah, that came next. Kinda like a one, two knockout. See, they followed with something worse, something just devastating, biological attack. Smart, gotta give 'em credit for the misdirection. The sick sons of bitches released somethin' in the water. If you ask me, lucky ones died in the blast. - No, this isn't happening, this isn't happening. This can't be happening. - Hey, okay, whoa, whoa, whoa, let's slow down. Slow down, slow down. - It is happening. - Slow down, you okay? Look, I know that this is a little, a lot to handle right now. - I, I need to get to my family. - I understand, but let's just, let's just do this, okay? Let's go to sleep, all right? Get some rest, and then when you wake up we'll show you some footage, some news footage, okay? - Okay. (camera beeping) - Okay, I think this legendary come-from-behind win needs to be documented. Are you actually stretching your legs? - You would wanna come from behind. (Brad laughing) - Can I watch a movie already? - [Brad] I'm almost done whopping your boyfriend's ass, and then yes, absolutely. - Whooping my ass? You're about to kiss my ass once I sink this shot, shit! - [Brad] You actually missed the entire ball itself. - Okay, shut up. - (chuckling) You did a great job sabotaging your own game. - [Alex] Whatever. - (clearing throat) Let's see. - [Lily] Hello? - Do you hear something? - Is it who I think-- - Hello? - [Alex] Hello, Lily, we're up here. Why don't you come join us? Oh, you better miss, miss, miss, miss, miss, miss, miss. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, miss, miss. Ah. (laughing) - Fuck. - [Alex] Suck it. - [Brad] Goddammit, all right. - [Alex] Let papa show you how it's done. - Lily, how are you feeling? - I'm fine. - Come on, let me take a look at you. (pool balling clunking) (Alex laughing) - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, I was distracted. - I win, you lose. - It was a bullshit win. - Game, set, match. Roll, uh! - Alex, you know I don't fuckin' drink. - You know the bet. You know the bet. (Brad groaning) Make it a double. Double shot of whiskey. - Fuck. - [Alex] Followed by a double of that oh so sweet, oh so delicious Aunt Jemima, mm! All right, hey, syrup first, here we go. - Stupidest fucking plan - No time to wait. - in the world. - Come on, come on, come on. Oh, jeez. - Um-mm, um-mm. - [Alex] Lick it all, it's an asshole, lick it all. - [Brad] Uh-uh. - [Alex] There it is, whiskey, whiskey, whiskey, whiskey. Oh, I'm gonna throw up. - Ah! Ah! - Oh, shit. (laughing) - Oh my god, what're you guys doing? - I lost, I lost a bet. - I can tell you what he's doing. (laughing) Oh, it's just disgusting. - I lost a bet. (Alex laughing) - You seem to be healing all right. - Thank you. - Fuck you. - Did I remember something correctly? You guys said something about footage, right? - [Alex] Ah, that's right, we did. Okay, so our movie on hold temporarily. All right, um, well, live coverage stopped a few days ago. This is the only station still broadcasting on the satellite. It should answer your questions, at least the most important ones. - Reporting KSCY News. As many of you know, the United States has fallen victim to the worst, most notorious terrorist attack in recorded history. If you are lucky enough to have survived the blast, please get to one of the government's emergency trauma centers. There are two in the city, one on the east, near Jefferson Park, one on the west at the Kennedy High School's football field. The government has provided temporary living, food, and medical attention. If you are unable to get there, coordinated rescue efforts are in effect. But based on what our correspondents on the ground have seen, the efforts are slow moving. If you are not in any immediate danger, we urge you to stay where you are. (TV beeping steadily) - Is, is that it? - [Alex] Oh no, there's more, wait for it. - Attention viewers, contrary to our initial broadcast, it has been told to us by the government that no longer should you stay where you are and wait. The blasts, now confirmed as dirty bombs, contained radioactive material designed to cause radiation poisoning. Additionally, and more pressing, there has been a follow-up attack unknown to us until right now. The group ISIN, the most extreme branch of ISIS, has claimed responsibility for the attack, and has posted a second message on the internet. They claim to have tampered with the water, introducing a biological agent into all major water supplies nationwide. After inspection of various supplies (muffled by TV static), it has been confirmed, the threat is real and it is terrible. The CDC has given us instructions to broadcast. It is not yet known what the disease is, but it is imperative that you cease using all city water immediately. What we do know, is that if contracted, the disease will act fast. It will start as a simple rash, but will soon flare up and cover the body. Coughing, chest and stomach pain are all indicators. If someone is infected and you need to interact with them, please use any personal protective equipment, gloves, masks, et cetera. It has been confirmed that this disease is not airborne, but will pass through bodily fluids and from skin-to-skin contact. At this moment, there is no cure. So please, protect yourself and act accordingly. Following this broadcast, we will show footage of the disease and its progression so you can better identify it. It saddens me to say, this will be our final broadcast. We recommend getting somewhere safe outside the city. Use water sources not connected to the city water, such as lakes or rivers. Be sure to boil your water first. From everyone here at KSCY News, I'm Wendy Nash signing off. Good bless America, and good luck to all. - This is the part that I can't watch. - Oh, yeah, sure. - Not for me. Mm. (sighing) - Oh my god. - God's not here. - Now do you get it? - I just, I can't believe it. It just feels like a bad dream. - [Brad] Yeah, we've had a lot of time to process this, and you're gonna need some too. - Oh it's just, it's just unbelievable. What is with the camera? - Great question. See, the others thought I was crazy but, I figure we need to document everything, you know, so there's a record. - [Brad] I didn't say you were crazy, Alex-- - Yes, you did. - [Brad] No, I said you were-- - [Both] Insane. - Oh, same difference, whatever. - It's the details, Alex. - [Alex] Whatever. - [Brad] (sighing) But the more I thought about it, the more I realized, if the next generation survives, this is history, they're gonna need to see all of this. - Yeah. (sighing) Look, you guys, I am so thankful for what you've done for me but, I mean, I need to go, I need to get ahold of my family. - Good luck with that. - What Alex means is that, it's impossible. Okay, uh, cell service is pretty non-existent up here, and satellite TV, well, as you can see, there's no other broadcasting besides the emergency broadcast system, so people know to stay away from the cities and the infected. - Okay, okay, um (sighing) where's my stuff? Okay, I must've had a bag. - A bag, right? - Yes. - Yeah, I got it for you, hold on. Here you go. - Thank you. - [Alex] Hey, watch the felt. - [Brad] Alex. - Shit, does anyone have an iPhone charger? - [Brad] Oh we're we're droid users, sorry. - Okay, well can I borrow someone's phone? Maybe I can send a message. - Yeah, our phones are dead too. You can thank Alex for that one. - You're still putting that on me? - Yeah. - Okay, look, in my defense, with all the explosions and the craziness, I didn't exactly stop to think, I should pack the socks next to the cellphone chargers. Yeah, you guys call me an idiot-- - [Brad] Whoa, whoa, Lily, Lily, listen, listen, look-- - What, please let me go. - [Brad] You have to reasonable, okay? You have no idea what is going on out there. If you run into somebody that's infected, that's it, you die. - Besides, do you even know where you are? Do you even know how to get back to the city? - I don't know, why don't you tell me? - [Brad] You're in the Acade Mountains, okay. It's about a four, five hour drive back to the city. I've been coming up here for years. I don't know any road signs, but I mean, I could make you a rough map, but it's, it's just not worth it. - Okay, well then I'll drive there. You guys got here in a car, right? I'll just take that. - Yeah, great idea, and um, when you magically pull that gasoline out of your ass-- - Alex? - What, she's acting stupid and I'm the asshole. - (sighing) Okay, okay, okay. Uh, so the only way out of here is to hike out. - [Brad] No, no, no, no, no, you can't consider that, okay? - Why? - [Brad] The weather the way it is, you'll freeze. Or get lost, probably both. (Lily breathing heavily) - Oh my god, I, this just can't fucking be happening. - Oh, it is happening. And since someone has to be the cold, hard dick and say it, I will. - Phrasing. - All right, look, since neither of them are gonna say it, I will. Look around you, we didn't ask for this to happen, but it did. Now we're just trying to do the best we can to survive. You better come to terms with that real quick. Uh, you know what, hey, still wanna start that suicide march, by all means, just don't let the door hit your ass on the way out. - Alex, come on, she's been through enough. Let's go get dinner started, come on. (Lily sighing) - Look, Lily, I know this is a lot but, it's, it's gonna be okay, I promise. - I just miss my family. - Oh I know, I know you do. I mean, look, we all do, I, wait, wait, where you goin'? - [Lily] I just need to be alone. (camera beeping) - [Brad] I guess I'll show you a little bit of the tour. - Okay. - [Brad] This is the, the fun room. - Fun room, oh, I remember that pool table. - [Brad] Yes, you unfortunately had to see me do a Canadian double. - I did see that. - A cocky Canadian double. (Lily laughing) - And then a wet bar, that's pretty nice. - [Brad] Yeah, yeah, exactly. - Cool. So, where does everyone else sleep? - [Brad] My room is right here. - [Lily] Okay. - [Brad] Jess and Alex sleep there in the master. - Got it. - Uh-huh. - And-- - Oh. - What's in this room? - [Brad] Ah, you know, nothin', it's uh, it's locked. - Oh. - Yeah, don't worry about it. (Brad chuckling) - Okay. - Yeah. - In there? - [Brad] It's the bathroom. - Oh. - Yeah. - Okay. - [Brad] So I guess, probably a good time for some house rules. Uh, number one, if a door's locked, like that one, don't go in. Trust me, if you walk in on Alex or Jess going at it, it'll scar you for life. - (chuckling) Okay, noted. - [Brad] Yes, um, and when you're feeling better, and Alex will undoubtedly reiterate this 'cause he's, he's kind of a dick, um, just help out with the normal housework chores, stuff like that. - Okay. - Yeah. - That sounds simple enough. - [Brad] Yeah (chuckling), and then we go on scavenging runs. So, there's three parts to that, okay? - Okay. - [Brad] Number one, tell everybody where you're going. Number two, always use the buddy system. - Okay. - [Brad] Number three, always carry around PPE. - PPE? - Yes. - Um, personal protective equipment? - [Brad] Yeah, wow, not just a pretty face. Yeah, just another way to minimize the risk of exposure. - Nice. - Yeah. - Um, anything else? - [Brad] Well we, we share everything, so no hoarding. - Okay. - [Brad] And honestly that's about it. Yeah, the rest is just minor stuff. - Oh. - [Brad] But, your room, right here. - Oh, nice. - Mm-hmm. - Thank you. - [Brad] Absolutely, it's the bridal suite. (chuckling) - Is it the bridal suite? - [Brad] And the doors. - (chuckling) Well um, thank you for showing me around. - Of course. - And for my room. - [Brad] Yes. - Um, I'm actually gonna get some rest and finish the rest of my tea. - [Brad] Yeah, right, absolutely. Well, if you need anything, I am just down the hall over there. - Unless your door's locked. - [Brad] Unless my door is locked, exactly. (chuckling) - Mm-hmm. - [Brad] Well, goodnight Lily. - Goodnight. (camera beeping) - [Brad] All right, we have been watching Alex try to chop wood for about an hour now, right? I think it's time we make a little bet. Hey, Alex. - [Alex] Hm. - [Brad] Nice tape job, by the way. We've been watching you try to chop wood for about an hour now, so I have a bet to make with you. - Okay. - Okay? - Let's see it. - [Brad] All right, if you chop this piece of wood-- - Okay. - Okay? I will do anything you want. - Anything? - [Brad] Anything. - You heard him say anything. - [Brad] That's right. - Okay. - Okay? - Better get this goin'. - But-- - Oh. - [Brad] If you miss this piece of wood-- - If? - Or you don't break this piece of wood, okay? - All right. - [Brad] You gotta do a dying cockroach in the snow. - What the fuck is a dying cockroach? - [Brad] Seriously dude, Christmas, three years ago. - What Christmas? - [Brad] There's only one Christmas in a year. - No, no, I mean like, what, where were we? - [Brad] The bar. - That was the whole-- - [Brad] Yep, you know, and you're gonna do it in the snow. Come on, are you a man? - Okay, all right, all right, all right, but when I win-- - [Brad] Oh. - We're taking those shrooms tonight. - Oh you fucker. - Tonight. - Okay. - No more putting it back. - [Brad] All right, hand it right there, you see it? - You heard it, man. - You got it? - [Alex] All right. - Babe, no. - I got this, come on. - She's a witness. - [Alex] Have some faith in me, all right. - [Brad] All right, Paul Bunyan, let's see you do this thing. Look at that footwork. - I need technique, dude. (Brad chuckling) (Brad laughing) That counts. - [Brad] That doesn't count, it's stuck in the wood. - Fuckin' counts, man. Babe, does that count? - Look. - [Alex] Let's go to the judge, we'll go to the judge. - Shards of wood. - [Alex] We're goin' to the judge. - Judge. - Babe, I told you not to do it. - [Alex] You kidding me? (Brad laughing) Whatever. - Look at that. - All right, you know what? - Look at that. - I'm not a fucking woodsman, all right. I don't do this forte, my forte is computers. - [Brad] What the fuck is a woodsman? - It's someone who chops wood for a living. - [Brad] You're an idiot, come here, let's go. - Come on. - Right there. - Do I have to do it now? - [Brad] Yep, I want the slush. (Alex groaning) I want the slush. - Okay. - Let's go, get in there. - Thanks babe for stoppin', I appreciate it. - [Brad] Come on. - Okay. - [Brad] Do it. ♪ I'm a dying cockroach. ♪ - [Brad] Louder. ♪ I'm a dying cockroach ♪ ♪ I'm a dying cockroach ♪ - (chuckling) Look at him. ♪ Look at me, look at me ♪ - Oh, hey Lily. - Ouch, okay. - Hi. - Good morning. We uh, kind of ate breakfast without you, sorry. We just thought it'd be better if you slept your natural cycle. But there is still some, it's just a little cold. - It's okay, I'm actually not that hungry. Yeah, I think um, honestly my body just needed the rest. - How are you feeling? - Better, a lot better. Um, my body still aches in a few places and my head's a little tender but, overall I'm doin', I'm doin' pretty good. - Good, maybe next couple days you can actually start to hold your own? - [Brad] (laughing) Like you with the wood? - [Alex] Oh shit. - [Brad] Unbelievable. - What Alex means is we only have so much canned food. So, we've been scavenging what we can. The nearest houses are still pretty far away. Since they're mostly vacation properties they've been pretty well-stocked with stuff that lasts. - What about the water situation, isn't it bad to drink? - [Brad] No, that's the city water, actually. We use lake water which, well, we're pretty sure it's okay. - You're, you're pretty sure? - Yeah, we've been drinking it since we got here, so there's that. Um, but, that makes food our main concern, that and the infected, someone fill her in, I gotta take a piss. - Hold on, Jess, take this. - Okay. - Okay, Alex, this does not mean you get out of chopping wood. Oh geez, see how hard this thing is anyways. (Lily chuckling) He's an idiot. - Wait, uh, infected? - Hm. - There're people around here? - [Jess] Not really. We're pretty well isolated, so we haven't had much contact. - But that is the last thing that you want with them. - With them? - Yes. - Well who are they, these infected? Uh, I don't, I mean, I kinda remember the report but how do you know they're infected, what's wrong with them? - [Jess] Like the news report said, people who are infected get a rash pretty quick. It starts at the point of contact and then spreads. Reports have said it can happen within hours. Once you have it, you're on borrowed time and at risk to everyone around you. (Lily sighing) - That is why it is imperative that if you see anybody, even if they seem normal, walk away, okay, it's for your own safety. - Yeah, reports say 50 feet of distance, fuck that, if I see infected, I'm shoot to kill, pew. - Alex. - Unbelievable. - What, I'd be doin' them a favor. Better a bullet in the head than lettin' that disease kill you all slow like. See, okay, if I ever get it, you have my express consent to send me to the next fucking plane of existence. Am I right, dude? - Noted. - Come on. All right, let's role. - [Brad] You're forgetting one thing there, buddy. - [Alex] What? I know. - Yeah, shit. - I need bullets too. - Yeah. - Um, okay, I'll get the bullets and those things. - Uh, you're doin' that wrong. - [Brad] (laughing) She's right. - I know, whatever dude. All right, let me get the bullets and we'll go, okay? - [Brad] Go get the bullets. - Wait, where are you guys going? - We're going on a scavenging run while we still have light. - Oh, well, be careful. - I will, I can't vouch for him. (Lily chuckling) But hey, if you can, can you help Jess out with some chores around the house? - [Jess] If you're up for it, I could use your help. I still need to do an inventory of the supplies we have. - Sure. - Cool, I'm gonna go help out the idiot. - [Alex] Brad, where're the bullets? - Seriously, did you forget your pills today? What's goin' on with you? (Lily chuckling) (camera beeping) - [Alex] Told you I'd get the fire started, suck it, Brad. Something wrong? - No, um, actually just been meaning to ask you guys, you're so far out, how do you get power out here? - [Alex] Ah, since you haven't had the full tour yet, you haven't seen the generator on the side of the house. - Don't forget the propane tank, which I think Brad's checking on. - [Alex] Big ass propane tank's more like it. I mean, it makes sense with Brad's bazillionaire uncle and his huntin' buddies comin' up for weeks at a time. - As I'm sure you've mostly noticed, we use power at night and we use the natural cold from outside to store the meats that the guys bring back from their trips. - [Alex] Um-hmm, and speaking of, how's the squirrel? - Mm, I mean, it's a bit gamey, to be honest. (Jess laughing) But it's food, and I'm thankful. - [Alex] Sure. Thanks, babe. - Mm-hmm. - Oh, no, actually, I got it. - Are you sure? - [Lily] Yeah, you guys cooked, I can clean. It's the least I can do. - [Jess] Wow, thanks, Lily. - [Lily] (chuckling) You're welcome. - [Jess] All right. - [Alex] Well, in that case, I get you all to myself tonight. (Alex groaning) - Oh my god. (laughing) - There we go. Mm, happy anniversary. I'm cool right here, let's just go for it. - Don't you think-- - Uh-hm. - We should take this upstairs? - Maybe she wants to join. Huh, what do you say, Lily? - Shut-- - A little menage a three-way? - Nah, I'm good. - Shut up. - [Alex] No, I mean, I'm cool if you are. - [Jess] Night-night. - Goodnight you guys. (water flowing) - [Brad] Hey, Lily. - Hey. - Did, did they leave the camera? They did leave the camera on, didn't they? And they left you with the dishes. - [Lily] No, actually I volunteered. - Really? - Yes. - [Brad] Jess. - Oh, hey, sorry, Alex locked us out again. Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Night. - [Brad] God, he's a dumb ass. (Lily laughing) All right. Well, can I lend a hand? - Um, sure, you can dry if you want. But you don't, you don't have to. - [Brad] Well, I don't really know what else I'm gonna do. - All right. - Plus, I've um, I've enjoyed spending time with you. - Me, me too. - So tell me a little about yourself. Um, do you have a boyfriend back home? - Oh wow, how long have you been waiting to ask that? - Well, I mean, come on, how often are you stuck in an apocalypse and there happens to be a beautiful girl? - Mm, no boyfriend. - No boyfriend. - Uh-uh. - Huh, okay, good to know. - Okay, well what about you? - Me? Um, no boyfriend back home either. - (laughing) Okay. - No, I'm, I'm uh, I'm straight. (Lily laughing) I'm not gay. Um, not, not that I have anything against the gays or anything like that but you know, they um-- - Uh-huh. - That's a choice that they make, you know what-- - Do you wanna was this? - Let me wash that. - Okay. - I'm gonna stop talking now, it's probably for the best. - Well, are you at least gonna answer the question? - Uh, no girlfriend back home. - I don't believe you. - Oh really, why is that? - Uh, well um, a guy like you, he'd definitely have a girlfriend. - Mm. Okay, well, managing a bar has its perks. I mean, women they, yeah they throw themselves at me. - Okay. (chuckling) - Every night. Mostly for the free drinks and the VIP hookups. But, you do um, you know, you don't, you don't meet quality girls at the club. - Really? - Yeah. - Well, what makes a quality girl? - (sighing) Well I mean, I'd have to include physical attractiveness on the list but um, someone who's smart, independent, strong-willed, has strong family ties, and someone who, someone who's incredibly passionate. - I'm sorry. - Lily, uh. Fuck. (camera beeping) (knocking at door) - [Lily] Yeah, come in. - Hey. - [Lily] Hey. Is there something that you need? - I um, look, downstairs I shouldn't have kissed you. I'm sorry. - [Lily] No, it wasn't that, it was what you said about family ties. It just made me think about my family and how much I miss them. - Gotcha. May I have a seat? - Yeah. Just, I'm very close to my family, and they're always, always there for me when I need them. And right now I feel like I could use them and it's just the thought of never having them again hurts. - I know, I know what you mean. I, I miss my mom, I miss my sister, very much. - Well haven't you tried to contact them? I mean, aren't you curious to see if they made it? - Yeah, of course. My sister and my mom lived in a condo together near one of the hospitals that, with the explosion, it's not, it's not look... - You can talk to me, okay, just, I wanna listen. - When everything happened, I uh, I called my mom, check to see if she was okay, and I, I didn't get any answer. And we were in such a hurry, so we, we left town. As soon as we were out of town I received a text message from her. And she uh, she was one of the most positive people I've ever met in my life. She said, "Honey, everything's gonna be all right, "everything's fine, but, me and your sister have uh, "run into a bit of a situation." And, they had been round up in one of those quarantine zones for trauma and infection. And I, I don't think there's any way that they made it out. - I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. - [Brad] Me too, I am. - I'm sorry. Oh baby, can you, can you close the door some? - [Brad] Yeah, yeah. (camera beeping) - Do you think that they heard us last night? - [Brad] Um, I don't know. I guess we'll find out, right? - Yeah. (laughing) - [Jess] Good morning, you guys. - Oh, I'm sure it is a good morning. - Alex, shut up. - What? We had sex last night too. So wait a second, everybody here got laid last night. Guys, I am so proud of you. - It's such a good-- - [Brad] Good lord, look, just ignore him, okay. Breakfast of champions. - Hey Brad, do you know your uncle has some freak out shit? Uh. (laughing) - Dear god, Alex. - That's your family. - [Brad] Where did you even find that? - It was a closet in the back. - [Brad] Good lord, that is disgusting. - No, I'd say disgusting are these nipples, they're so disproportionate. - [Brad] That's what you're worried about is the nipples? - Yeah, well maybe the pubes too because they're really curly and kinda dark. - [Brad] Good god. - Yeah. - [Brad] I am so sorry, just erase that from your mind, immediately. - I'll try. - [Brad] Ooh, okay, today, first scavenging run, how are you feeling? - Um, well not thrilled at the prospect of running into infected people. - Don't worry, with Alex by your side, nothing will happen. Will it, babe? - [Alex] Not on my watch. - Oh. - Oh, Jesus, okay. - Oh, wait, you guys aren't coming with us? - No, we have some things to do around here. - Yeah. - Okay. - [Brad] Oh, by the way, got everything, all your stuff? What do you need? - Yes, yes, I just need to put my boots on. - Your boots? - Then I'll be ready, yeah. - [Brad] Alrighty. (Lily sighing) (Brad clearing throat) - Okay. - All right. So, just make sure your cute ass comes back safe, all right? - (laughing) Okay. - Brad, (snapping) come on. - Okay, yes, oh, and I want you to film everything. - Everything. - Okay? - Um, I don't, I don't know how to use the camera. - It's super-easy, all right. It's just like a gun, okay, you point, and you shoot. - Point and shoot, like a gun. - Yeah, that's it. - Okay, well I know how to use guns. Cameras are a little different. - How do you know how to use guns? - [Lily] Oh, my dad was in the military and taught me how to use guns. Um-- - Really? - [Lily] But, even though I know how to use them, I just, I hope I never have to. I don't, I don't really like to use guns. - Such a democrat, you ready to go? - [Lily] Yes, I'm ready. - [Alex] Come on. - Just be safe, okay? - I'll try. - See you soon. (Lily laughing) (zipper scraping) - [Lily] Well this should be fun, right? - Yeah, somethin' like that. - [Lily] Wait, we're not gonna take the car? - No gas, remember? - [Lily] Okay. Forgot. Well maybe we'll find gas on our scavenging run. - Maybe, haven't found it yet so don't get your hopes up. Don't slow me down. - [Lily] Okay. (camera beeping) So what did you used to do before all this? - I uh, used to work with computers. - [Lily] Oh, like the Geek Squad? - Somethin' like that, hey, keep your voice down, okay? - [Lily] Okay. So did you used to do programming or something like that? - Yeah, something like that, it was mostly contracts. What's with all the questions? - [Lily] Just trying to make conversation. - Well, you're being annoying, so. - [Lily] (sighing) Well, can I ask how you guys met? - Yeah, about Jess and I, we used to go to school together. (Lily groaning) Straight up ahead over the ridge. - [Lily] Okay. - From the looks of it though, we're gonna need some PPE, so turn that thing off, let's get ready. - [Lily] Okay. (camera beeping) Wow, is this it? - [Alex] Yeah. - [Lily] My god, this place is huge. Do you think it's safe? - I don't know, Lily, I've never been here before, but that's why I have this glove off, I don't wanna take any chances, not today. - [Lily] Oh man, I really hope it's safe. (door rattling) What? - Shit, it's locked. Okay, okay. - What're we gonna do? Uh, uh, break a window? - Let me think, let me think, let me think. Uh, well I'd rather not get injured today if I can avoid it so, hey, put that thing down, let's try to find the hind-a-keys. More often than not those rich assholes-- - Hide-a-keys? - Tend to leave their keys back in the city. - Okay. - All right, search up here. - [Lily] All right. - Better to be lucky than smart. (Lily sighing) Hello, anyone in here? - Hello. - We're gonna rob you. - [Lily] God, this place is so big. - [Alex] I know. - [Lily] I don't think anybody's here though. - I don't think so either. Okay, here's how it's gonna go down, we're gonna split up. (Lily sighing) Remember, look for anything that's useful. - [Lily] Okay. - Food, water, uh, medical supplies for Jess. - Food, water. - Any pills, just save 'em for me, I'll divvy 'em out later. - Pills? - Yeah. - [Lily] What kind of pills? - You're gonna take upstairs, I'm gonna take downstairs. Be careful, be quick, be smart. - [Lily] Okay. - Hey, if you run into anything, any problems, cover up, get the hell outta there, go. - [Lily] Okay, um, okay. (sighing) Anybody here? Oh my god, wow. What is this place? That's weird. All right, uh, anything useful, useful, useful. What's in here? (door rattling) Dude, it's locked. All right, let's check in here. Um, (sighing) shit. Okay. Come on, there's gotta be something in here. Something, come on, come on. What about in here? There's gotta be something in here. Shit. Dang it. (sighing) God, there's nothing here. Pretty rugs. Yes, think I just found something. Ah, yes, yes, yes. - Hey, what're you doin' down there? - [Lily] Um, uh nothing. I was just trying to find some useful things. - Did you find something? - [Lily] No, uh, no luck at all. Books, blankets, pillows. You know, all the non-useful things you told me not to get. - Right. - [Lily] What about you? - Yeah, actually, a pretty good stash. Some canned tuna, some fruit. Come on, let's try to hit some other cabins on the way back, before it gets too dark. - [Lily] (clearing throat) Okay. (camera beeping) Come on, shit. - [Brad] Hey. - Hey. - [Brad] I just wanted to congratulate you on your win for Cards Against Humanity. - Oh, yeah um, I just got real lucky. - [Brad] I've never seen anything like that before. - I haven't either, to be honest. - [Brad] What you uh, what you up to? - Um, I was just looking at my phone. - [Brad] Yeah? - Yeah I, I found a charger the other day and I used it to charge my phone. And I was just looking at pictures of my family. - [Brad] Oh, can I take a look? - Uh, sure. - Cool. - Yeah. - Oh my goodness, tell me that's, is that your sister? - That is my sister. - Oh my goodness, you guys look exactly alike. - I get that a lot. - That's cool. Looks like you have a nice family. - Thank you. - Um, look it (sighing), it's none of my business, and I, I wasn't eavesdropping, but I know you weren't looking at pictures of your family. - Um, what, what do you mean? - I know you were trying to call them. - (sighing) Look, uh, I don't want you guys to think that I'm ungrateful or anything, it's just that I have a really-- - No, look, look Lily, I, I get it, I get it, just for me, I don't know, I always just thought it would be easier if I just let them go. - Yeah, well, I guess it doesn't matter anyway, no cell service. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Okay, I got a crazy idea. What if tomorrow, we hike up to the top of the mountain, and see if we can get a signal? - Really? - Yeah, why not? - Are you sure? I mean, won't, won't the others find out? - I'll come up with somethin', leave a note. Uh, but I mean, it's not like you're a prisoner here, you know? - Mm-hmm. - Hey um, I, I know that you're an optimistic person and I don't wanna encroach upon any of that, but I, I don't want you to get your hopes up. You know what I mean? - Yeah. I know, I know what you mean. You really are one of the good guys, aren't you? - Yeah. (chuckling) - Where were you before the attacks? - I was just, I was just doin' my thing in the city. - (laughing) Managing a bar? Mm, no, I don't, I don't mean it like that, okay. - Okay. - That sounded bad. But I mean, I mean didn't you wanna do anything else? - Anything? - Yeah, anything. - Gosh, I mean, I, I love filming, especially nature. And, I mean, I'd love to be able to travel. I think that would just be the coolest thing. Um, but I, both of those things require money. - Uh, you know they have jobs for that exact thing. Yeah, the Discovery Channel or Nat Geo, one of the two, they actually pay crews to go on location, travel the world, they take video of landscape and animals. I have contacts, I will definitely put you in contact with them. - You're, you're just forgetting one thing. - Oh yeah, the attacks. - Yeah. Look, hey, hey, thank you though, you know. Hey um, you're a really great person. I'm so lucky to have you here with me. - Yeah, me too. (Brad and Lily moaning softly) Uh, uh-uh. - [Brad] Oh. - My god, turn that off first. - Okay. - My god. (camera beeping) - [Brad] Hey, stop for a sec? - Yeah? - [Brad] You look beautiful. - Stop. (Brad laughing) It's my turn to have the camera. - All right. (Lily laughing) Let's climb this thing. - [Lily] All right. - Hey, by the way, last night, I uh-- - [Lily] I, it was great. I actually wanted to tell you I felt like I got to know you a little bit better. - Oh really? - [Lily] Yeah. - Well, I had a great time last night. I want you to know I'm not like uh, uh player or anything. (Brad and Lily laughing) - I honestly am not worried about it. There's not a slew of options out there anyway. (camera beeping) (sighing) - [Brad] Anything? - Uh-uh. - I'm sorry, hey, I'm sorry. - It's okay. I really, really thought that there could be a chance this time. - Yeah. Well hey, you're not alone, right? Got me. - Right, you're right. Do you think we could just stay up here for a little bit longer? - Yeah, of course. - Okay. - [Brad] Absolutely. (wind whipping) (camera beeping) Look at that. - [Lily] Sure is pretty. - [Brad] That's incredible. - Brad. - [Brad] Yeah? - Oh my god, do you see that? - Careful, what? - [Lily] It's a car! - Oh my god, no, Lily-- - Oh my god. - Stop, stop, stop. - Maybe it has gas. - [Brad] Lily, I didn't bring any PPE. Please don't touch, don't touch anything. (Lily speaking muffled) Goddammit, she's touching everything. - [Lily] Come on, start, start, start. - Fuck. Is that, what the fuck? - Shit. - Does that say water? Okay, okay Lily, this is bad. We really need to go. - Do you hear that? - Really, no. - Is that live? - No, what, no. - The radio. - Absolutely not, let's go. We really need to go. - [Lily] They just said today's date. - [Brad] No they didn't. - Yeah, they did. - No, they didn't. No, no. (crackling) Did you hear that? Okay, we need to go. - Yeah, oh my god. - [Brad] Right now, we really need to go. - Okay. - Right now, come on. - Oh my god. - Lily, no, no, no, don't touch. - What is that? - [Brad] Don't touch it, don't touch it, don't-- - What is it? - Leave it, leave it alone. - Brad. - That's dried blood, let's go, let's go, out. (camera beeping) Hey just, remember, don't mention anything about the Hyundai, okay? - [Lily] Oh, okay, got it. - (chuckling) How nice was it up there though? - [Lily] It was beautiful. - Wasn't it? - [Lily] Again, hey, thank you for what you did. - Of course. - And they're back. - Jesus Christ, Alex, what the fuck are you doing? Sitting here with sunglasses, are you sunbathing in the shade? With a, a bear? - That's Frank. - Frank. - Where you guys been? - We went on a scavenging run, bro. Didn't you get my note? - I saw the note, it seemed pretty vague. What'd you find? - We didn't find anything, it was a bust. - That happens. - What, pills, more? What is it this time? - Where'd you guys try? - Oh, the other side of the lake. - Bear Lake? - Yes, Bear Lake. - That's an interesting choice, 'cause you know we've already cleared that area, right? - Yes, I know that, I thought it'd be a good spot for Lily to kinda get her feet wet in the whole scavenging run 'cause she hasn't done much-- - Hey, Brad. - And it would be safer. - [Lily] Brad, hey, why don't, why don't you just tell him? - Whoa, hold on, hold on, tell me what? - Guys, what's going on? - Oh, great timing and question, Jess, 'cause we are just about to find out. Well, Bradley? - (sighing) Okay, I lied. - I fucking knew it, I knew it. - It's not what you think. - What is it? - (sighing) I took Lily to the top of the ridge so she, she could see the sun rise. - Oh, you're being serious? - Yes, I am being serious. - (chuckling) That is the most romantic thing I've heard all day. What are you two like, dating now? - [Lily] It's not like that. - What is it like then, Lily? - Alex. - Uh-uh. - It's really none of our business. - Jess is right, she's right. What you two wanna do, that's your thing. But hey man, we tell each other everything. And we sure as hell don't go out unprotected. You know that. - Mm-hmm. - I know you didn't bring the rifle, so tell me, did you at least bring the PPE? - No. - Bro. - It's cumbersome. - Come on. - It doesn't fucking matter. - Dude. - [Brad] It doesn't matter, knock it off. - I just have to preach. - Okay? - Come on, man. - Just-- - Oh, come on. Mm. - What, what is it? - Look, I'm gonna give the girl a break, she's new, she doesn't know what the hell's goin' on. - You're so kind. - But you, man. - Um. - Oh, you know better than that. You could've brought back the disease-- - Yeah. - Without even knowing it. Infected your girl right here, infected my girlfriend right here, infected me. Come on, man, that's unfuckin' acceptable. (Brad chuckling) See these are the simple rules that we follow that keep us safe. Rules, hey, we both made those rules. - Yes, we did. - (sighing) I just, uh man, I can't, I, I just, I can't, okay, well, I just, all right, man, I just, I need a second, I need-- - Alex, Alex. Chill out, okay. (Brad sighing) - I know, but it's some, I just, I, bro, I'm sorry for comin' at you, I am. - Okay. - I am. You know that was, that was unfair of me, my apologies. - Yeah. - All right, do you forgive me? - Yes, I fucking forgive you. - I'm sorry. Okay. I just, okay then man, just so we're clear, just so we're clear, just don't be so fuckin' stupid next time, okay. (Brad laughing) - Oh, okay, just, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm. - Come on. - Okay, okay, I'm gonna, I'm gonna catch you guys later, okay? - [Jess] Brad. (sighing) (brush crunching) What're you looking at? - [Lily] Uh, I don't, I, do you ever get the feeling that someone's out there? - I mean, it's a big forest but I doubt it. We'd know. Come on, let's go inside, let's have some lunch, okay, okay? - [Lily] Yeah, you're right. (camera beeping) - Hey, did you get a look at the moon tonight? Man, it was massive. The stars were absolutely stunning. - [Lily] Um, I actually did look, they were really beautiful. - I know. - [Lily] I like the stars at night here. - Me too, it's gonna be a great night. There you go. (glass clinking) Hm. (Lily clearing throat) - Whew. - So, how you doin', Lily? - I'm fine. - Fine? You can't be fine. Okay, look, I'm gonna level with you. When everything went down, I was scared shitless. And the first few days just felt like a, like a bad acid trip. Everything was destroyed. Life as we knew it was blown up and biologically attacked. This, I mean, the new normal, ah, it's fucked up. - Well, when you put it like that, I guess I'm not fine, fine. You know, I, I miss my family, and I miss my job, I was really, I was really good at it. And I, I don't know, I miss Taco Tuesdays, and I miss bowling. - You know, I actually 100% agree. I um, I don't like Mexican food, but everything else. But, I will say, there is something appealing about this new world order. I mean, isn't a small, eency, weency part of you enticed? Think about it, life is savage now. It's wild, it's basic. But, it's kinda beautiful. - No, it's not, not really. - Anyways, back to what I was saying. What was I saying? Oh yeah, oh yeah, I don't remember when it happened exactly, but I sorta had this epiphany, you know, the light bulb thing. Set aside the fact that everything was fucked, and life became clear. You know, like, just cut out all the complex shit in our modern lives, cell phones, schedules, be here, do that, just, take it all away. Everything is simplified. Don't, don't misunderstand me though. We have to work hard if we wanna stay alive, yes ma'am. And only the strong, as long as they, well as long as they follow a few, we'll call 'em, essential rules, they're the ones who are gonna survive. They will be the meek. - Wow. Well, in vino veritas. - Excuse me? - In vino veritas, it's a, it's just a phrase. It roughly means, in wine there is truth. - I don't speak Spanish. - It's not Spanish, it's actually Latin. - Well in that case I guess it'd be uh, in whiskey veritas, right? How's the drink? Refill time? - Mm, mm, mm-mm. - You sure? - No, I'm good, no, this is good, I'm-- - Don't wanna go down that rabbit hole? - Uh (laughing) I really haven't eaten a lot lately, so this is, this is just perfect. It's gettin' to me pretty quickly. - Okay. - Um, you know, if we're being honest. You know, Jess, she's, she's great. - Ah, she's the love of my life. - And, and, and, and Brad, he's, he's so amazing. - My bestie. - Yeah, but you, that's a different story. You, you just, I just don't-- - You don't trust me, do you? - No, I wasn't gonna say that. - That's exactly - No. - what you were gonna say. - I wasn't going to say that. - See, I don't think you fully appreciate what I've done here, Lily. Supply runs, hunts, staying up late to scan the parameter making sure you're safe and snug in bed. Does my temper flare from time to time? Yeah, sure. Newsflash, I'm human. And I get it, I, I do. You, you feel out of place here. Hey, like I've always said, you can leave whenever you want. (Lily groaning softly) But just know, that day back at the city, you know, we didn't have to save you. We did it because it was the right thing to do, because it was the humanly thing to do. You'd be best not to forget that. - I, I really appreciate what you've done for me, okay-- - Yeah, it sounds exactly like it, uh-huh. - I wasn't saying it like that, I-- - Hey, man. What's goin' on? - What's goin' on down here? Heard some voices. - Ha, nothin', just a couple people havin' a chat about life, isn't that right, Lily? - Uh-huh. Yep. - Where you uh, goin'? - [Alex] To inhale the savage beauty, my friend. (Alex howling) - Okay, uh, Alex. - [Alex] Yes, Bradley. - We've got a big day tomorrow, okay. Why don't you get some sleep. Hey, you okay? - Mm-hmm. - What uh, what was that about? - I don't know. - Look, Lily, I, there's something I need to tell you, okay. I, I don't know how you're gonna take it, I just think that, you okay? - I'm sorry, yeah. - [Brad] You all right? - Um, yeah, I think it's just the, the alcohol really got to me. - Did you let Alex pour, he pours strong. - Yeah. - Yeah, you know, let's uh, let's just get you to bed. Okay? - Okay. - Yeah? - [Lily] Mm-hmm. - Come on. Oh, okay. - Whoa. Okay, I got it, I can do this. - It might be a little bit of altitude. - [Lily] Uh-huh. - [Brad] Let's go. - [Lily] Oh god. (door banging) (Lily sighing) - [Alex] Where'd the party go? Somethin' wrong with the camera? (camera beeping) (Lily exhaling deeply) - Brad, I got your note. "Lily, Alex and I have gone on a supply run. "We should be back around mid-day, Brad. "P.S. Remember to film everything, it's important to me." (exhaling) Man, so I have a splitting headache. (exhaling) Maybe I can find some aspirin. Hey, Jess. Are you in there? I was wondering if I could get some aspirin. (door rattling) Please. (Lily sighing) (door lock clicking) Yes. All right, I'm just gonna go in for a second, all right. I just need some aspirin really, really, really bad. All right, where is it, where is it? Wait, what is all that? Is that? What? What is this? - Lily, what're you doing? - Um, I was, I was, I was actually gonna get some aspirin for my head, but, your door was open. - It was, 'cause I'm pretty sure I locked it. - Um, Jess, what, what's with the DVDs? - Oh, oh, um, nothing, this is Alex's, and this is, the guys, they just made news report-- - Oh. - Copies and, they think that when the world comes back one day, they're gonna sell it and make millions. - Oh. - I know, right? - Um, I just, I thought, I don't even know what I was thinking. Wait, is someone yelling? Do you hear that? - Yeah. Come on. - [Lily] Okay. - [Jess] Come on. (Jess and Lily yelling) - We, Brad! - Brad! Brad, what happened? - Brad! (Brad yelling) What happened, what happened? (Brad yelling) What happened? Oh my god, oh my god. - Oh I fucked up, oh. - Oh my god, what happened? What, where's Alex? - He's fucking-- - Where is he? - Where's Alex? (Brad yelling) (all yelling at once) What happened, what happened? You left him? - He's infected, he's infected, I left him. - Oh my god, I'll be right back. (Brad groaning in pain) - Lily. - What am I gonna do, what am I gonna do? - Lily, he said he's coming back, he's gonna infect all of us. (groaning) - What am I suppose to do? - You gotta shoot, you gotta shoot him, Lily. (crying) - [Lily] No, I can't do that. - Lily, you have to shoot him. - [Lily] I can't kill someone, Brad! - Lily, you have to fucking shoot him. I can't, my fucking arm just took me back. You have to shoot him, somebody, give me the camera. Give me the fucking camera. (Brad groaning in pain) - [Lily] Oh god. (Lily panting and sobbing) I'm sorry. - [Alex] No! (gunshot blasting) - [Jess] No! (yelling) - [Lily] Oh god. - [Jess] Get the fuck off me. - [Lily] Oh, I'm so sorry, what do I do? What else can I do? (Alex muffled by Jess and Lily yelling) - [Jess] What did you do, Lily? He's dying, his brain, it's not registering. - [Brad] Lily, back up, Lily, get away from us. Lily, Lily, get away, get away from us. Go, move. Get away, Lily, get away from us. (Jess crying) (camera beeping) (Lily crying) I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I wish that there was another way. Okay, I need to check to make sure you're not infected, okay? (Lily crying) All right. You need to turn this way. Okay, you seem to be fine. Let me see your hands. (Lily sniffling) All right, I don't think you have any signs of infection. - How do you, how can you be sure? - [Brad] Well, if we wash these with a lot of alcohol, and you know, I don't see any spots on you at all, okay? (Lily shuddering) Look, you're freezing, let's get you inside by the fire, okay? Come on, come on, come on. (Lily sniffling) Come on. (Lily shuddering) - [Lily] No, no. (Lily breathing heavily) - [Brad] All right, go have a seat, okay. Right over there, by the fire, okay? I'm gonna grab you a blanket. (Lily whimpering) Here. Okay. (gloves snapping) (Brad groaning) - What's wrong? (Brad groaning) - It's dislocated. (groaning) But Jess set it back. - Jess? How's Jess? - She needs some time alone. - (crying) Brad. What happened? - Well, Alex and I went on an early morning scavenging run and we hit a couple of houses, and then Alex found tracks on the ground from a, a buck. He became obsessed with this buck, and we just kept following it farther and farther out, and we ended at this ravine and where he was standing the ice gave way and he slipped, and I dove to catch him but, I, I grabbed his arm but I couldn't, I couldn't hold on to the glove that he had on and he just, he tumbled down into this ravine and landed on a bunch of dead bodies. Infected dead bodies. I, I don't know what else I could've done. (Brad crying) - That's why he blamed you. Brad, you can't blame yourself for that. (Brad crying) - I know, I just wish, I just wish there was something I could've done. - I know. (Brad sniffling) I'm, I'm so sorry. (Lily breathing heavily) - We've had a long day, okay, you've had a long day. Let's, let's go to bed. - Okay. - Okay. (camera beeping) - [Brad] Here. - Is there no fire? - No, not tonight. I, (groaning) I can't chop any wood with my arm. We don't have much wood left anyways. - I can do it. - Really? - Yeah. - That's really nice of you, thank you. Just, let's just do it later though, okay. Stick with blankets for right now. - So what are we gonna do, what's the plan? - I don't. - I don't care. (bottle clunking) - Well we have to think of something. - Yeah, we, we can't, we just, we can't just stay here anymore, okay. It's only a matter of time before bad luck comes for us too. - So what are you saying? You just wanna go back to the city? Smart idea, Lily, I mean, you've already killed Alex, you might as well just kill us now too. - Hey, no, that's not fair. Okay, I'm not saying that. What I'm saying is I think it's a good idea if we go back to the city and find people like us. So that we can find out what's really going on. - Lily, I, I get what you're saying, I get it. But, but we don't have a bad thing going on here, we've got food, we've got water. - Yeah, but that's not-- - Why are you being so selfish, Lily? This entire time you've been trying to leave. And I hate to break it to you, but everyone you know is as dead as Alex. - Okay, okay, what she's trying to say is that there's nothing left for you back there. - I don't know what to tell you, okay. After the storm passes, I'm gonna leave. Okay, and you guys are more than welcome to come with me but I just can't stay here anymore. - Lily, don't you think that's a bit brash? - No, actually, I think it's a little past due, to be honest. - [Brad] Mm. - Okay, come on, you guys, just come with me. All right Jess, it's not like-- - Don't you fucking touch me. - It's not like we can't come back, come with me. - I can't believe I'm hearing this. I'm outta here. - Jess, come on. - Brad, come with me, please. Please. - I don't think, I, I would, but you know I can't leave Jess here. - Yeah, I get it. Well, I'm just gonna go back. (banging) - [Lily] What was that? - [Brad] Ah fuck, what was that? - [Lily] I don't know. - [Brad] Okay, look, stay here, I'm gonna go check this out. - No, I'm coming with you. - [Jess] Someone's here, at our house? - Okay, fine, wait, yes, somebody's here, just, okay yes, grab the camera and come with me. (camera beeping) (Brad breathing heavily) Hey, you, I don't know who the fuck you are but you need to get up right now. You are not welcome here, you understand? - [Mo] Please, please, you have to help me. - We don't have to do shit. Get your ass up and leave, right now. (Mo panting) Is he sick? - [Lily] I don't know. - Hey, you need to get up right now, and leave, get up. - [Mo] Okay, okay, okay. - Come on, move, move. - [Mo] Okay. - Jesus. - Oh my god. - [Brad] Goddammit. - [Lily] Oh my god is, oh my god, is he faking it? - I don't know. If you're faking it, I swear to god, I will shoot you. (camera beeping) - You're positive you didn't see any signs of infection? - [Lily] No, nothing, I mean, just this weird tattoo on his wrist but, I mean, no rashes or bumps or anything. - Look, regardless, he's locked in the garage for right now, so we're safe. - [Lily] I thought you guys said there was no one else around here. - No, what we said, we didn't think we saw anybody around here. - [Lily] Well then, how did he get here? Where did he come from? - Who gives a shit? I'm wondering what we're gonna do with him. - [Lily] What do you mean? - He can't stay here. - What? - Please tell me you guys feel the same way. - [Lily] No, he needs our help. Brad, back me up on this. - No, Lily, I'm sorry, I'm with Jess on this one. - [Lily] Are you, I cannot believe I'm hearing this. So you would save me but not him. - Oh, okay, it is not that simple. - [Lily] Oh, it's exactly that simple, Brad. - Really? - We only have so much food, plus we don't know anything about him, and on top of that he just looks shady. - [Lily] He doesn't look shady, he just looks Middle Eastern. - But, sh. Did you hear that? I think he's waking up, okay, all right. Are you guys ready? Careful. All right, follow my lead. All right, Lily, you need to go check the window, tell me what he's doing. Jess, when I say, open the door. What is he doing? - [Lily] He's just laying there. - [Brad] All right, Jess, open the door. Okay, you ready? Here we go. All right. (Mo groaning) Listen up, you do exactly as I say, okay? - [Mo] Huh-huh. - First off, what is your name? - [Mo] Ob lotfan. - [Jess] What the hell is he saying? - [Lily] I, I don't know, he said that earlier. - Your name is Ob Lofton? - No, my name is Mo. Please, I really need some water. - [Lily] Water, I got it, I got water. - [Mo] I need some. - What are we gonna fucking do? (Mo speaking foreign language) Lily, just go slow okay. Mo, move back. Now put it down, nice and slow. All right, back up. Go ahead, Mo. So, hey, don't touch the fuckin' shovel. (Mo panting) Easy. (Mo shuddering) Jesus Christ. All right, you've had your water. - Thank you. - No, don't thank us, we got questions for you, 'kay? - I know, I have no right to ask, but I'm so cold, so hungry, please, can you spare some food or a blanket? - Fuck no, not until you-- - [Lily] Brad, don't be so callous. Jess, you're a nurse, isn't there an oath to help people? - That's doctors. - [Lily] Fuck this, if you guys won't help him, I will. - [Brad] Goddammit, Lily. Ah, okay, Mo, listen up. You're gonna get the best goddamn courtesy of your life, okay? If you try anything, and I mean fucking anything, I will fill your body with holes. Do you understand me? - I won't try anything. (camera beeping) - All right, Jess, that's enough, enough. - Medically you seem fine. My guess would be dehydration and malnutrition. - Seems like a good guess. I haven't had food or water in days. - [Lily] Oh, here. - Thank you. - [Lily] You're welcome. - [Jess] So, what language were you speaking earlier? - Persian. - Persian, who the fuck is that? - It doesn't exist anymore, it's Iran now. - Iran, what the fuck is a towel head like you doing in the Acade Mountains? - Brad! - No, okay, I'm with Brad on this one. Our city isn't exactly bursting with Middle Easterners. - What the fuck are you doing here? - You don't have to answer that, okay? - Oh yes, he very well fucking does if he wants any more of my food he will sing if I ask him to. - Could you please get some firewood first, please. - What gives you the impression I would ever get wood for you? Hell no, it is story time, let's go. You know what, Jess, as a matter of fact, get the camera, I want every detail of this lying sack of shit's face. - I was here visiting my girlfriend. - What is her name? - Melissa. - Where'd you meet? - We met online. - Online? - Tinder, man. - What the fuck is Tinder? Where're you coming in from? - Chicago, Illinois. - Oh really? - Why don't you just let him finish the story, okay. - [Brad] (sighing) Fine. - [Lily] Go ahead. - I, I'd just reached the city limits when the bombs went off. I had no idea what was goin' on. I just knew I had to get to Melissa. But, she lived downtown, and with the fires and the people and the destruction, it was clearly impossible to get to her. Then I tried calling her, but, the phone lines, none of my calls would go through. I didn't know what else to do. - So, what, you just gave up? - No, not at all. I must've been there for a day or two, I don't know. The police, they took us to this, this high school for safety but, I looked for Melissa there too and she was nowhere. Then someone told me about another shelter on the other side of town. And I, and I went there, and I looked for her there and, she wasn't there either. I just hoped she was okay. I prayed and I prayed that I would find her. I kept denying it, I kept denying it. I convinced myself that she was alive somewhere. (crying) But, you get that feeling, you know. I hope it was quick. I hope she didn't suffer. (Mo crying) - Hey, it's okay. Tell us what happened after that. - At the time, it was just people talking. But, we heard things, reports about some radiation fallout. And as if that wasn't bad enough, the word got out about the water. And oh my god, I've never seen such panic in my life. I mean, hundreds upon hundreds of people all violent, crazy, confused, it was a freakin' mob. And I knew exactly where that was going. So I got in my car and I headed straight outta town. I ended up staying with this, this group for a couple days until one of them got that rash and then I, I left. I figured it was safer just, just to be on my own. - [Brad] Okay, hold on, let me get this straight. You came in from Chicago to meet with your girlfriend, Melinda, then decided-- - It's Melissa. - Yeah, Melinda, then decided after what, a day of searching-- - I was there for two days, man. - Oh my god, two days. Two days of searching, you decided to go wander off into the woods, meet some strangers and go camping, and then magically, stumble upon our house. Wow, you know what, that seems like a great piece of fiction to me. - Man, don't you dare mock me like-- - Wait guys, guys, guys, stop, stop. - I lost my girlfriend back there. - Back off, back off! - My girlfriend! - Sit down! - (crying) Don't you dare think I don't feel like a coward for leaving her, but I was there, man! - Yeah? - And I saw it all. And there's no way she made it. And I would've died too had I stayed in the city. I mean, look at you guys. You guys are up here, and not down there with the rest of the bodies. (Mo breathing heavily) - All right, okay. Next question, what kind of car do you drive? - What? What does it matter? - It matters because I'm asking the question. What kind of car do you drive? - A Hyundai. - Wait, a black Hyundai? - Yeah, what, you want the VIN number too, asshole? - What happened to your car? - It ran out of gas. - [Jess] And you what, wandered the mountains aimlessly? - Yeah, that's exactly what I did. There's no point being in a car without gas. So I headed off and I tried looking for anyone. - And just, came across our house, is that it? - Dammit man, what is your problem with me? - What is my problem with you? You know, Mo, here it is. I don't like towel head fucking terrorists blowing up my country, and I don't like liars. And you know what, you seem like both. - Do you wanna know how I found your cabin? - Yes, I do. - I heard a gunshot, okay, and I headed towards that gunshot. I figured a gunshot meant people, people with some food, people with a shelter, people with some water, all of which I desperately needed. What, you happy? - [Lily] Well, makes sense, Brad, he probably heard when I shot Alex. - Any more questions, detective? - Yes, as a matter of fact, I have a thousand fucking questions, but you know what, I've had a pretty fucked up day. So you know what, Lily, grab him a blanket, he's gonna sleep in the goddamn garage. - What, no, that's ridiculous, it's freezing in there. - Okay, then grab him two. If he wants to stay here, he's gonna be under lock and key. - That's fine, I get it. - Let's get moving. (camera beeping) (scraping) - What're you doing? Brad. Are you serious? You wouldn't even throw a log in the fire for Mo when he asked because he was freezing. - Lily, that is not his wood, that is our wood. - I, I don't understand you. When did you become so cold and racist? This isn't the Brad I've come to know. - Lily, my best friend is dead outside, okay. And some Middle Eastern guy shows up at our doorstep and just lies-- - Lies, lies, how do you even know he's lying, huh? - It's obvious, didn't you hear him say he had a black Hyundai? That can't be a coincidence. - Maybe, maybe not. (Brad sighing) - Okay, look, let's just say for a second, okay, that I believe you. He is who he says he is, right? Then how do you explain the papers in the back of the Hyundai? I mean, am I just so crazy to think that he's not one of the terrorists responsible? - I, I, I don't know, okay. But I get what you're saying, okay, I just think we shouldn't jump to conclusions. - Let's just, my head'll have cooled down tomorrow. But I still have questions, I've got-- - I do too. - Look, tomorrow, we'll let him finish his story, okay? But if something doesn't add up, okay, or if it's not right, or if it, it, it, it, it, it doesn't work-- - Then we'll, we'll give him food and water and then we'll ask him to leave. - Lily. - It's the right thing to do, you know that. - Just, everything that happened with Alex today. If something happened to you, I have no idea what I would do. (camera beeping) - Okay look, I mean, his story hasn't changed. Okay, and I believe him. I mean, what do you think? - [Jess] Yeah, I guess I kinda believe him too. At least I don't have any reason not to at this point. - There's, there's, there's just something that's off about him, and it, I don't trust him! - Well isn't that the world that we live in? I mean, look, I know it's not my house, but I vote that we let him stay. - [Jess] What, here, for how long? - (sighing) It's the right thing to do. Besides, if we let him go out, he'll die. (Jess sighing) - Okay, okay, I can't believe I'm gonna say this we, we can let him stay. - (gasping) What? - But, but, only until we figure out what we're gonna do with him. - Okay. - Oh! - Okay? - Yeah. - [Jess] I, I can't believe I'm hearing this. I'm outta here, whatever. - Let's go tell him. All right, Mo, by the good grace of God, or whatever it is that you call him, we are gonna let you stay. But, this is not gonna be-- - Thank you. - A permanent solution. No, no, no, do not thank me. You can thank her, do not thank me, okay? And just so we are crystal fucking clear, okay, if you do anything that I perceive is suspicious, or puts any one of us in danger, do not think I will hesitate to shoot you. - Of course. - Okay, do you understand? - I won't-- (hand pounding) - Do you understand? - I understand, I won't try anything, I promise. You have my word. - I'm gonna go check on the propane. - [Lily] Okay. (Lily sighing) - Thank you. You're kind to a complete stranger. I owe you my life for that. - [Lily] It's okay, I mean, I was an outsider too once. Uh, Mo. - Yeah? - [Lily] Can I ask you something? - Of course, anything. - [Lily] Do you think, I mean whenever you're feeling better, do you think that you can show me the road back down, please? - Look, I appreciate what you did for me back there, I owe you my life for that. But, if I'm being completely honest, there's just no way I would ever go back down there. It's, it's a death sentence. And even if I found my way back to the car or the roads that I took, Lily, the city was completely destroyed. It's still radioactive. I hate to say it, but there's just really nothing left for anyone there, I'm sorry. I know it's hard. - [Lily] It's okay, I guess that just confirms the reports. - The reports, what reports? - [Lily] The news reports. I mean, haven't you seen the news? - Uh, at the shelters we didn't have any TV, and then, I was in the car and on foot, remember? - [Lily] Yeah. Hey let's, let's go upstairs, I wanna show you something. - Okay. (Lily sighing) - [Lily] So, Mo. - Yeah. - [Lily] Is that short for something? - My real name's Mohammad. - [Lily] Mohammad, oh, wow. Um, yeah, we'll just keep calling you Mo. - Why, 'cause of Brad? - [Lily] I'm sorry. - Whatever. - [Lily] All right, let's just have a seat. (Lily sighing) - [Reporter] It will start as a simple rash, but will soon flare up and cover the body. Coughing, chest and stomach pain, are all indicators. If someone is infected, please-- - I think I've seen enough. - You haven't seen-- - Please, Lily, whoever did this, they killed thousands of people, including my girlfriend. I can't relive this, I'm sorry. - Um. - I'm sorry. - [Reporter] At this moment, there is no cure. (sighing) (camera beeping) - I told Mo that if he wants to stay here he has to start contributing. So I have him chopping wood. That should keep him busy for awhile. - [Lily] Well, shouldn't we be doing something too? - No, not yet. What, Jess, what is it? - Well, what about Alex, I mean, we still need to bury him. - No, I mean, yes, just, I don't want us divided, okay? I don't want us going on any runs, scavenging, anything. Not with him here, I, I do not trust him. (Lily groaning) - I don't trust him either. - [Lily] What're you talking about? I thought you said you did trust him. - I do, I mean, at least his story makes sense. I don't know, something just seems off. - [Mo] Hey guys, I'm gonna take a break. I'm gonna take a piss for a second, okay? - Okay, yeah just do not be long, okay. We burn through a lot of wood. - [Mo] All right. - [Lily] Guys, I'm not saying that I trust him completely, but I don't distrust him. - What about all that stuff you told me about? About his car and the paperwork in the back. - [Lily] That's, I don't even know, we didn't even inspect it. - I know exactly what I saw, Lily. Okay, those were building schematics in the back and I'm 99% sure it said water treatment plant. - What're you saying that he could be like one of the terrorists? - [Lily] Guys, we should not be jumping to conclusions about him. - (sighing) I'm sorry. I'm hearing everything you guys are saying, I just, I just can't stop thinking about Alex. I can't believe he's gone. - [Lily] Brad, look, I know you don't wanna leave Mo unsupervised but, I gotta take Jess's side on this one, okay, we, you just can't leave Alex like that. He deserves to be properly buried. - All right, we're gonna have to burn him. - What, are you fucking kidding me? You wanna burn my boy-- - We'll cremate him. - You wanna cremate your best friend? - Look, Jess, we don't have a lot of options here, okay. The ground (foot stomping), nearly frozen solid, okay? I'm not gonna dig through that, so that's enough, all right. I'll figure out what to do with Alex, okay. Just, in the meantime, you girls stay here, keep the gun close, and if Mo does anything suspicious, well, you know what to do. - [Lily] You really think it's gonna come to that? - I'd, I'd rather you be prepared. - [Lily] What, what is it, what's wrong? - For a guy who's gone to take a piss, he's takin' a really long time. Hey, what the fuck is going on over here? - [Jess] What's going on? - [Mo] What, nothin'. - [Brad] What did you just put in your pocket, huh? What the fuck did you just put in your pocket? - What're you talkin' about, man, I was just takin' a piss. - Really? Unless you have a detachable dick, I just saw you take something out of your pocket. What was it, huh, what was it? - Look, it was nothing, okay. I should get back to the wood though. - No, no, no, no. - Brad, calm down. - No, Lily, okay, no, you're not going anywhere until you tell me what you have in your pocket. Cough it up, let's go. Oh my fucking god. Unbelievable, who were you calling, huh? Your terrorist buddies? - What, terrorist buddies? - Who was it? Yeah. What's the password? What's the password? - Look, if you weren't such a paranoid asshole, maybe I'd show you. The password, it's 69, 69. - [Brad] Sixty, oh my god. - It's 69, I wasn't calling anyone, okay? - Really? - There's not even service up here. - Then what were you doing? - I was just, I was just looking at pictures of my girl. Okay, of us. - So real, really? - That's all. - Uh-huh. - [Jess] Is that true? - Recent applications. - Of course it's true. - I wasn't asking you. - Everybody just calm down. Brad, what is it, just tell us. - He's telling the truth. - I told you. - Well what about the texts and calls? I mean, he could've shut those apps down quick. - Exactly, yes. - I can't believe you guys. Uh! - [Jess] What is it? - Nothing, just stuff that dates back to the day of the attacks. - I told you. - For now. - I just miss her, man. - Oh, Jesus. - I loved her. She was the love of my life. (Brad sighing) And looking at pictures is all I have left. Is that okay with you? - Oh my god, okay, just look, get back to chopping wood, all right. We only have so much daylight, okay? - Whatever, man. - Go. I'm gonna go take care of Alex's body. I will let you girls know when it's time to say goodbye. (camera beeping) (Jess crying) - Hi, Alex. (crying) I'm so sorry. I can't believe this happened. This was suppose to-- - Jess? (Jess gasping) Are, are, are you okay? - No. - Is there anything I can do to help? - Yeah, you can do some fucking dishes. - Jeez, okay. I'll do the dishes. (sighing) Well, where's that soap, okay. (sighing) Ah shit, the towel. Right. Okay. Fuck, dude! You scared me, man. You sneak up on everyone here? Something I can do for you? - I don't trust you. - Well that would be obvious. - You might have the girls fooled, but not me. (laughing) Your story has so many holes in it, and everything about you is shady. - Whatever, man. - And I'm gonna prove it. - Prove what? - I've seen your car, I've seen the shit in the back seat. The building schematics, maps, all of it. I know you're involved in the attacks 'cause I can fucking feel it. - You are insane, you know that? - Uh, maybe, maybe not. We'll see tomorrow. And if it is like I think it is, let me put it to you this way, you will not be able to hide behind the girls' pity anymore! - Don't, stop. (Mo breathing heavily) Look, I'm going to bed, you finish the dishes. - What the fuck did you just say to me? Get out. - What the fuck is goin' on here? (Brad breathing heavily) - Ah. (camera beeping) - [Lily] Jess. Jess, hey. (Lily sighing) Look, I hate you like this. You gotta do something, this isn't, this isn't healthy. - I know. Alex, I just, I just don't wanna do anything. - [Lily] I know you don't wanna do anything but, you gotta, you gotta move. Come on, let, let me get you up, come on. Please. - I don't know, Lily. - [Lily] Please, just trust me. Let's go into the living room. Hold on a second, hold on a second, Brad. - [Jess] What's going on? - [Lily] Wait, wait, wait, wait, Brad, Brad, Brad! - You piece of shit. - What, what? - You snuck out. - Oh my god. - Oh my god. - You moved the fucking papers, didn't you? - Get off of him. - You son of a-- - Get off of him. (Brad yelling at Mo muffled) - Didn't you, huh? You knew I was goin' down, you got rid of the fucking papers, didn't you? - Man, what the fuck are you talking about, man? - Brad, Brad just calm down. - No fucking way, I told this lying sack of shit I was gonna call him out on all of his shit. Well you went, and you got rid of the fucking papers, didn't you, huh? Son of a fucking bitch, huh? - Let him go. - No, oh my god, Brad. - Stop it. - You fuck! - Brad, Brad take a second and calm down! - Just let him go! (Lily breathing heavily) - Oh my. - What the fuck? (Lily breathing heavily) - Brad. Brad, Brad you're scaring me. - [Lily] Oh my god. (Mo coughing) Are you okay? (Mo breathing heavily) - Brad. - Brad, Brad, Brad, what's with the rifle? - Oh god, Brad. - [Lily] Stop, just stop, just talk to us. Tell us what happened, okay? - What's with the rifle? - I went to find his car. You. - I thought you said you were going for a run this morning. - I lied! - Are you calling me a liar? - Shut up! - Brad! Oh my god. - You son of a bitch. I went to find his fucking car so I could prove it to both of you. That he's been lying this entire fucking time. This piece of shit. - No. (Mo groaning) - You left, and got rid of your fucking papers, didn't you? You got rid of your fucking papers, didn't you? - Stop. - Left last night and did what, man? - You got rid of the fucking papers, you destroyed them, didn't you? - Stop, Brad! Brad! - I'm not fucking crazy, Lily! Okay, we both fucking saw it, the papers, they were in the back seat, but this lying sack of shit threw the shit away. - No, no, no. - Stop it. - Let go, let go! - Ah! (Mo crying out in pain) What? You think I left last night without any one of you hearing me? - [Brad] Goddamn right. - (panting) And found my car that I abandoned, and lit some magical papers on fire? - Magical fucking papers-- - Without any one of you hearing me? - [Lily] Jess. - God, dude, you're fucking insane. - [Brad] I'm gonna fuckin' kill you. - [Lily] Oh my god. (breathing heavily) - Brad, listen to me. I'm not calling you crazy, okay, but his story makes sense. (Mo coughing) We would've heard him coming and going, the floors creak and the walls are thin, you know that. - [Brad] He's a liar, he's a fucking liar. - [Mo] Fuck, dude. - You son of a bitch. - I don't know how else to prove it to you. My name is Mo Bolouri, from Chicago, Illinois. I came to the city to see my girlfriend, that's it. And she died in the attacks! - He's a fuckin' liar. - Mo Bolouri, man. You can hit me all you want, but I am not a fuckin' liar. - [Brad] Yes you are a fuckin' liar. - And I'm not a fucking terrorist. - You are a fucking terrorist! - I'm just as American as you are, asshole. - [Brad] That's a fucking lie, that's a fucking lie-- - Stop it! - You slimy fuck! - Stop! - Where the fuck do you think you're going? - [Mo] To get some water, is that okay with you? - Fine, fine, I want you to follow him, take the gun, take the gun and follow him. - All right, fine. - Are you okay? - Yeah. - [Lily] Brad. - I am not fucking crazy, Lily, I know what I fucking saw. You were there, the papers, they were in the back seat. - [Lily] Yeah, I, I, I, I believe you. I just think there's a better explanation. - Fuck, maybe you're right. God, my head's so fucking twisted, I don't know. I just, oh. - You just need to rest. - Yeah. - Okay? - Yeah. - Just get some rest. - Yeah. Thank you for believing in me. - Uh-huh. - I just, I, I just need to rest, you're right, okay. Look, just find me later, okay? - [Lily] Okay. (whimpering) (camera beeping) - They're fighting. - What? - [Jess] Brad! (Brad and Mo grunting and groaning) Oh god. (gunshot blasting) (Jess yelling) (Brad groaning) Are you okay? - Oh my god. - Are you okay? - Fine, I'm fine. (groaning) God. - [Jess] Brad, just look at me. (Brad groaning) Brad, look at me, what happened? - I fucking caught him. Ah, I fucking caught him red-handed. - [Jess] What do you mean? (Brad groaning) - You caught him? - [Jess] I can't find a pulse. - God. - Do you need water? - [Jess] Brad, you've killed him. - [Lily] No, I mean, we all saw it. Mo was reaching for the ax, he was gonna kill Brad, right? - Uh, uh, yeah, check the, check his phone. Uh, check his phone, check his phone. Check his phone, it's over there. - [Jess] Where is it? - [Lily] Uh, it's right over there, underneath you. (Brad groaning) What is it? What is it? - Oh, oh, mission accomplished, cities are destroyed, U.S. in panic. Return home, Allah Ahkbar. Oh my god. - [Lily] Brad, what, what happened? Talk to me, talk to me. - He went out front to make a call. I've been watching him the last couple of days. - Are you okay? - I'm, I'm okay, get off. I've been watching him the last couple of days and I saw him go to make a phone call. (panting) But I waited and I didn't confront him. He got a text message, and he went out to the wood. I followed him, that piece of shit. (groaning) While he was gone, I saw his phone, I grabbed his phone, I confronted him and he fucking attacked me, and I'm guessing that's when you girls showed up. (Brad groaning) - [Lily] I can't believe this. Are you, are you okay? - God. - [Lily] Brad, I'm, I'm so sorry. - [Jess] As long as you're okay. - Come on, let's get you inside. - Okay. - Come on, come on. Come on. - [Jess] Wait, wait, what're we gonna do with him? - [Brad] Let the animals take him, that piece of shit. - [Jess] Come on, come on. (Brad groaning) (camera beeping) - Okay, let's see. Anything but a six. (laughing) Oh my god, in jail. Honestly, I think this is the third time this game, unbelievable. All right, Lily. Lily? Lily, you're up. - Oh, sorry, my mind was wandering. - I know it's not exactly a culinary masterpiece, but Lily, you barely touched your food. Is everything okay? - Yeah, I'm fine, I'm just not hungry. - I know we haven't exactly known you for years, but I think it's easy to see that something's bothering you. - Yeah, Lily, you can talk to us. What's goin' on? - I don't know. It's just that, two people are dead. Weird shit is going on. And we're playing fucking Monopoly like everything's okay. - Okay, honestly, not everything is all peaches and cream, okay? Jess's boyfriend, my best friend, is outside dead because of that fucking terrorist, and I'm, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I just, these are the moments that make me feel sane amidst all of this chaos. - Look, I get that, I totally get that, I do. But don't you guys want more than this? Aren't either of you anxious to see what's going on in the city, at all? I mean, maybe the government has gone back to help. Maybe there are survivors, maybe there's-- - If you keep thinking like that you're gonna drive yourself crazy. We have a good thing going on here. - I know, it's just-- - Just what? - It's just that, something inside of me is telling me that I need to leave. I need to go back to the city. Maybe there's something that, that I can do, someone I can help. Maybe my family's still alive and is looking for me. Maybe-- - Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe. You're gonna risk your life on a maybe? What did we do, besides try to help you? (Jess sighing) (Brad sighing) - Look, Lily, that is a really big decision. Okay, why don't we just, why don't we just sleep on it, and then tomorrow we'll talk about it. I think-- - No, no, I've already thought about this long enough. - Uh. (sighing) Fuck. (camera beeping) - [Jess] You're losing control. - No, I'm not, everything is fine. - Everything is not fine. You're delusional if you think that everything is fine. The last couple days, that's not what a part-- - Keep your voice down. - My voice should be the least of our concern right now. - Okay, okay, look, everything is all right. Moving forward we'll have to adjust, we'll improvise. - Improvise? You'll have to excuse me if I can't solely rely on improvising shit. What'd you have in mind? - I think it's time we tell her. - Tell her? - What, tell me what? (Brad sighing) - You're falling for her. - Absolutely not, don't even go there. - Do you really think that telling her is the best course of action? - Yes, I do. Okay, look, we've already planned for that ending, okay? She still believes us. - Yeah, but her little ambitious attitude is really fucking shit up. - Oh, she's really fucking things up, huh? Didn't she find the DVDs in your room? - Hey, that wasn't my fault, Alex got sloppy. Yes she did, but, but I explained it. - She believed it? - Of course she did. - Huh. - You don't become a good actress without making people believe you. - Even still, okay, she's a smart girl. She's gonna find out one way or another, all right. Look, we have to convince her to stay. (camera clicking) - Lily? - It's fine, the light's still on, look, do you know what you're doing? - Yeah, I think I have a plan. - You think you have a plan? - I'll take care of her tomorrow. - [Lily] What is going on? (camera beeping) (knocking at door) - [Jess] Lily. (knocking at door) - [Lily] Um, hold on a sec. (door clicking open) Hey. - [Jess] Hey, can I come in? - Sure. I was just gettin' some sleep. - Yeah. - How are you feeling? - Oh, um, I'm okay. Listen, I just, I just wanted to come here to apologize for the way I've been acting lately. With Alex dying, it's kinda just gotten me all twisted. - I know, you don't have to apologize. - Thanks, Lily. You're such a good friend. - You know, I still don't understand what happened with Mo. I really don't, I mean, was he really a terrorist? I mean, why did he attack Brad? - Maybe we'll never know. But hey, now at least we're safe. (Lily sighing) Listen, I, I know you wanna leave but, I was hoping I could convince you to stay. - Jess, I don't know. - Well just for one more day, okay? To be honest, I really just, I just need a girlfriend right now. - (sighing) I don't, I don't know, I don't know. (Lily sighing) - Please. It would mean the world to me. And we still need to go out to get more medical supplies, with Alex and everything. - One more day? - Yeah, yeah, just one more day. - Um, okay, fine, one more day. - Yeah? - Um-hm. - Great. Okay, um, we'll leave at daybreak. - Actually, Jess, can we, can we sleep in tomorrow? I mean, the last few days have just been very exhausting. - Yeah. Yeah, of course. Sounds like a good idea. Um, all right well, I'll let you get some sleep. - Thank you. - I'll see you tomorrow. - Okay. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. (door clicking shut) Hm. Fuck that, I'm gonna leave well before that crazy bitch wakes up. Great actress, my ass. (Lily breathing heavily) Oh god, this is it, this is my evidence. It's gonna prove everything. I don't know what the fuck is going on between Alex's death and Mo and the shit I heard last night, something is off, I know something is wrong. And the more I think about it, the more I know I have to get away from those two. I can't be here anymore. I know my family is okay, and I know the city is okay. I gotta go. (camera beeping) Oh my god, it's a car! (Lily breathing heavily) Stop, stop, stop please, stop! Hey, stop! Oh my god, there's a car, yes stop, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. (breathing heavily) Please stop. Brad? - Why did you leave this morning? - [Lily] Wait, this is Alex's car. - You just made things a whole lot worse for yourself. - [Lily] What're you talking about? Brad! (yelling) (car dinging) - [Brad] All right, get her feet. - [Jess] Okay. (Lily groaning) - [Brad] Ah shit, there's somebody coming. Go show the camera. - Okay, yeah. - [Brad] Fuck. - [Kenny] Are you guys all right? - [Brad] Yeah, yeah man, appreciate it. How you guys doin' today? - I'm a mechanic, is something wrong - All right, Kenny, come on. - with the car? - No man, we're good, we're good with the car. Thank you. - They're fine. - Now it you'll just-- - Tony, relax, dude. - He's gotta be - Wife just wants to - the Good Samaritan. - film some stuff. You know how women are, right? - Oh, I thought you're battery - All fuckin' day - needed a-- - with this guy. - No, car's, the car's in good shape, just needs a wash, that's it. - All right dude, it's pretty rough. I thought you guys needed like a jump or something so-- - No, we're good. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, fine. - Okay. - How's it goin'? - Not too bad. - All right, guys. - Yeah, you guys have a good one, all right. - Thanks so much for stopping. - Have a good one, y'all.
