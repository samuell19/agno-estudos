Good morning. Well, you know his name, you know his face, the director, producer, actor, and writer of the Academy Award nominee Best Documentary, "Super Size Me." Is there any props or anything I need to know about? Is it just you? Just me. Camera one, medium shot. - He's joining us live this morning. - Good morning. Good Morning. Thanks for being here. Well, there is a new restaurant to cluck about. It's going to be a chicken restaurant. Brought to Central Ohio by Morgan Spurlock. The star of the documentary "Super Size Me." Now he's opening his own restaurant, right here in Central Ohio. With new paint outside and brown paper covering whatever is going on inside. Is it possible that we are all subject to one giant prank? - You open tomorrow? - We open tomorrow, 11 a.m. grand opening. Now, I know what you're thinking. How did a guy like me get into a business like this? Well, it all started when I received a very special email. "Hello, I'm reaching out from 72andSunny, the advertising agency for Carl's Jr. And Hardee's. We're exploring a concept for a script with Morgan Spurlock. He comes in one of our restaurants to expose us as a bad fast-food brand, then he discovers that we're actually doing a lot of great things; all-natural meat, made-from-scratch biscuits, hand-breaded chicken. So we're actually doing good for fast food. We'd love to know your thoughts." My thoughts are... you gotta be fucking kidding me. But it made me wonder, have things really changed? Welcome to Burger King. The new garden-fresh salads and wraps. Wendy's new black bean burger. Are things actually getting better? Has fast food gotten healthier? - Absolutely. - I think so. - I would say yes. - It's better for you and delicious. They wouldn't believe it's Taco Bell. With 44 % Americans eating fast-food at least once a week, better would actually be pretty great. We got some new salads on the menu. Dressing on the side. Dressing on the side, that's not a problem. At the same time, it's not like Big Macs and Whoppers are suddenly off the menu. - Meechie, you want a Whopper? - Yeah, he wants one. But look... now they have kale. McDonald's to call on kale. They said they're getting kale. - McDonald's? - Oh, yeah. The nation's obesity epidemic... The country's biggest health threat. A new study finds 2/3 of Americans are overweight or obese. So if we're not getting any healthier, has fast-food truly turned a corner? So much that they think a guy like me... You'll not talk to anybody. ...could actually be a spokesperson for a company like this? The most American Thick Burger, only at Carl's Jr. No, something's definitely not adding up. Mmm. To get to the bottom of it... - Would you like to supersize it tonight? - Oh, yes I would. ...I could go back on an all-fast-food diet. Oh, give me a minute. But something tells me this calls for a different approach. Better... New... Fresh... You see, my dad always told me if something seems too good to be true... it probably is. Now, if I've learned anything out of making a career out of questionable life choices it's that sometimes the only way to find the truth and solve a problem is to become a part of that problem. - Hey, man. - Morgan, how are you? - How are you? - Great to see you, looking great. - So, um, I had an idea. - Yes? Awesome. And I thought if anybody could kind of help me explore and figure out it would be you. - OK. Right. - 'Cause you've had experience in the fast-food industry. So, um... - I want to start... - Mm-hmm. I want to start my own fast-food restaurant. I want you to give me some advice. - OK. I want to open my own fast-food restaurant. Yeah. Is that a fact? Wait, say that again. I want to open a fast-food restaurant. - You do? - Yes. So, do you think it's a, do you think I'd have a shot? I don't know if you can be able to season the food right 'cause you're not a chef. But I would make it a given, based on your integrity, that the quality of the food is gonna be spot on. You know, having done "Super Size Me," I think authenticity is everything. And I think honesty is everything. - OK. - Does that make sense to you? Yes. Yes. Tell me what kind of food you think it would be. Um... - Pizza, salad. - Um... Vegetables, grain bowls, Mediterranean. What do you want to do? What is it gonna be? It better be good. Hey, I know it won't be easy. - You're crazy. But it's not like Little Caesars was built in a day. - Pizza! Pizza! - And these guys do have a point. Customers will come to my restaurant with certain expectations. Expectations like honesty and integrity. So in today's world, what does integrity even taste like? - Does it taste like a burger? - The Baconator. After all, with the rise of Shake Shack, Smash Burger, and Five Guys, burgers are a pretty good business. But at the same time, no one's claiming burgers are suddenly good for you. So what is healthier? What's different? What's a blank canvas? Something familiar but unassuming. Something common but still packed with delicious potential. Something like... ...chicken. ♪ Hallelujah! Hallelujah! ♪ Right now, at any given time, there's over 20 billion chickens clucking around the globe. That's more than three chickens to every human on Earth, making it the most farmed animal on the planet. Wendy's, McDonald's, and Chick-fil-A all go through 1.4 billion pounds of chicken per year alone. That's 3.7 million pounds per day and 43 pounds of chicken per second. But most importantly, chicken is a lean meat. It's accessible, affordable, and if any fast food could be considered healthy, it has to be chicken. Mm-hmm. Chicken's a wonderful product. It's not a bad idea. It's gonna be healthier. - It's an inexpensive food. - Yeah. Matter of fact, we are more likely to eat chicken than we are to eat beef, a beef-based product. Chicken overtook it a couple of years ago in--in--in its importance to our diet. How many people are doing better chicken? I feel like I haven't seen-- I've seen better burgers, but I haven't seen a lot of better chicken. There's a chain in this country, Chick-fil-A, who is doing fantastic. - Yeah. - Fantastic! And what are they doing? - Selling chicken. - As? - As a sandwich. - As a sandwich. In fact, the chicken sandwich is slowly becoming the new burger. - Sandwiches. - Sandwiches. That's--we love-- the number one food eaten in this country is a sandwich. - Not chicken on a bone? - No, no, no. It's inconvenient. - Messy. - Exactly. And what's the beauty of a sandwich? Yeah. I can drive and eat it. - It's very portable. - Right. We like sandwiches. Yeah. So, what advice would you give me now, as I'm going down the path of starting my own restaurant? My advice to you would be, you can't just have the same sandwich everybody else has. - Right. - You have to give me... some reason why this one is different. Yeah. Harry's right. - For every successful Big Mac... - Big Mac. ...there's been an equally unsuccessful Bell Beefer, The short-lived Wendy's Frescata, And, of course... McPizza. McDonald's Pizza. So how does a highly competitive industry design the perfect sandwich? You know, a sandwich isn't just a sandwich. Everyone has--there's so many choices out there. So why should someone pick you? There are consultants... What makes you amazing? Strategists... Is it the product? Is it the place? Is it the way that it's ordered? Food is an experience. If you could pick at least three. I think it's real. Fun. Trendsetting. But I think it's provocative. It's exciting, but it's gonna be a big task. - I mean, it's fiercely competitive. - Yeah. But most importantly, there are companies like CCD Innovation. CCD Innovation. Hey, it's Morgan Spurlock. - I'm Christine - Great to see you. - Pleasure to meet you. - Kimberly. Welcome. OK, let's come this way. CCD Innovations has teams of chefs dedicated to creating some of the industry's most successful menu items. This is the kitchen. This is an artisanal pita with a spicy sauce. So I used a gluten-free waffle with maple syrup and bacon in the coating. I wanted to try corn flour. I finally centered on the crepe. The kitchen here, kitchen lab, frankly, is where we marry business strategy and culinary trends... Yeah. ...with culinary art and commercialization. So that's essentially what our company does. - Pickles and herbs. - Pumpkin seeds, chia seeds. Nostalgic breads. They are masters at forecasting market trends and coming up with menu items that customers crave. For example the Sriracha Burger from Jack in the Box. - Slew-racha. - No, Sri-ra-cha. We did the BK shots for Burger King. Oh, I just wanna squeeze 'em. And, in fact, we were the group that created the Gordita. Viva Gorditas. And this is why I'm here, because I need people who are infinitely smarter than me to help me figure this out. At least in that spot. Yeah, and who--who understand kind of what this business-- what it takes to actually be successful in this business. OK. So what is behind this for you? - Sure. - What's your inspiration? What's your motivation? You know, why are you wanting to do this? Yeah, well, I think... what I've seen in the last, you know, 12 years is there's been this big trend, this big push towards healthier fare, healthier options. And I said, if I'm gonna focus on something healthier I should already be focusing on the choices people are making, - which is chicken. - Chicken, exactly. So what is your home run for your restaurant? What's the home run? When the consumer walks away from the restaurant-- - They tell everybody about it. - What are they saying? It looks different than everything else. It tastes different than everything else. And people look at it, it's like, oh, I trust that guy. - That's someone like me. - Exactly. - And have a story. - Yeah. And most importantly, what does that mean from a food standpoint? Every good restaurant needs a story. Burger King has the Whopper. Wendy's has Dave Thomas. And Subway has... well, you know. But as important as good branding is... There's a lot of chicken to think about. ...I first need to figure out what type of chicken is and isn't selling. All right. So you're ready to do some eating? - I am so ready. - All right. Let's go look at some restaurants so that you can kind of get a sense of what's happening out there. Let's go. We are coming up to Chick-fil-A, a number one in customer satisfaction. Hmm, a regular and a spicy. - OK. - Perfect. There's something about this chicken... - I crave it. - Oh, yeah. What's this ingredient in here? It-it's MSG. They've got MSG in this. A lot. So part of the reason why this is the fastest growing chain is 'cause they're cracking us out on MSG. They are. Yeah. The other thing about Chick-fil-A is, um... you should just never go there with your gay husband. I know. I think if you're not gonna be inclusive, then you can fuck yourselves. That's a scientific point of view. Pulling in to Wendy's. Can I take your order? What's your most popular chicken sandwich? - The Spicy? - Yeah. And what's the healthiest chicken sandwich? Mm. It's like somebody cleaned the grill with, like, cleaning solvent. You ever melt Styrofoam? Oh, research. That's what this is. - A little 7-Eleven? - Awesomeness guaranteed. Let's take a look. That's like an unfortunate colored sauce. - Oh, that's the signature sauce. - Oh, that's the signature sauce. I've got a new baby that's putting that in his diaper every night. Right there. Let's go. OK, so off to Organic Coup. Hey, how are ya? And this is all about organic through and through. You get, like, this real barn farm. I know, right? - $400. - No. - I feel like organic's gonna be too expensive. - Yeah. - Oh, fried chicken. - Three piece dinner. Awesome. Here's a chicken leg for you. So-- We are going to Bakesale Betty's, and the line's out the street. So this is the whole menu? Buttermilk fried chicken and coleslaw sandwich. And where do the chickens come from? - They're free-range. - OK. What does--what does free-range mean? I'm not sure what that means. I should know. Yeah. That's a good-looking sandwich. Ooh. Mm-hmm. Oh. Mmm. Oh, yeah. Hey, what's the healthiest sandwich you guys got? And then what's the most popular sandwich? So this is the Burger King most popular sandwich, breaded, fried. Mm. Ground up chicken bits inside. All I can say is this place is called Burger King for a reason. Oh, look, it's hollow. You can actually put it on like a mitt. You should not be able to do this with a chicken sandwich. Come on down to Burger King. Get yourself a Chicken Mitt. Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom. So we've eaten... - I don't know how many calories of chicken. - A lot. A lot. So now we have to work on honing in your vision. Yes. The hard part is, you want to provide healthy options, but at the end of the day, the healthy options aren't what's keeping the lights on. Right. So this is this kind of conundrum. Grilled chicken sandwiches, which are the healthier version... - Yeah. - ...are declining. And I agree that grilled chicken sandwiches are... ultimately boring. Right. And fried chicken sandwiches are growing. - Yeah. - You know, consumers crave this food. They're not willing to sacrifice the taste. But there's this interesting shifting definition of health, so it's not necessarily 100 % healthy for you. It may be bad for you, it's fried, but it's got some vegetables in it, so you feel better about it. - So it's a perception. - It's the perception. Then I should play into that as much as I can. Yes. It should feel like healthier food. My sense is you've gotta start with the chicken. - Hmm. - Right? I mean, how do you feel about... having your own chickens? That you raise, that you know what their life has been like, before, you know, we eat 'em. Sort of a farm to table sort of a feel. 'Cause no fast-food place is doing that. These people are still getting their chickens from someone else. And if I can have the farm that brings the chickens to the restaurant, that's a good story. - So, a chicken farmer. - Go forth and find your chickens. Take a step towards your future today. Farming, like any other market, is taking pride in your work, doing all that you can to provide the best environment that we can for those birds. I think Perdue cares about people as well as they care about the chickens. We're very fortunate to have a relationship with family farmers, and we feed a lot of people over the world. Today, chicken is a $48 billion industry. With so much demand, you'd think getting just a few thousand birds and a farm would be easy. Uh, hello. I was hoping I could speak to someone about getting some chickens. Getting some chickens? - Yes, sir. - Um... Uh... I don't know about that. Thank you for calling Perdue. Hey, uh, I'm trying to, uh, get in touch with somebody about getting some chickens. We don't sell our chickens. I'm trying to get some chicks. Let me transfer you to security. We don't give chicks to other than Tyson growers. OK. Would you happen to know a place? I sure do not. But the same way there's Big Oil and Big Tobacco, for poultry, there's Big Chicken. Big Chicken produces over 99 % of all the poultry consumed in the U.S., most of which is supplied by only five vertically integrated corporations. Tyson, Pilgrim's, Sanderson Farms, Koch Foods, and Perdue. And these five companies control practically everything. From the breeder farms, to the egg hatcheries, the feed mills, grow-out conditions, and the processing plants. Big Chicken dictates almost every part of the process. Look at it this way. The next time you're wondering which came first, the chicken or the egg? Turns out it's Big Chicken. Here's how it works. We will provide the birds, the feed. OK. You as a grower, you'll be responsible for all the costs associated with the building, the land, plus the, uh, utility costs, and the labor. OK. Like, how much is the costs for one house? I would recommend starting out with four. That's a million six. Um, OK. The standard is going to be an 80/20 loan. I believe there's another place in Bowling Green, Kentucky. One second, I'm sorry. I'm just writing this down. Thank you for calling Live Oak Bank - This is Josh. - Hey, Josh, how are you doing? I'm a first-time chicken grower I just wanted to call about getting a loan for my chicken farm. OK. What's your name? Morgan. Mm-hmm. Spurlock. S-P-U-R-L-O-C-K. Are you a filmmaker? Am I a filmmaker? Yeah, and a chicken farmer. Well, are you the documentary filmmaker? I-I am. Gotcha. Give me a little bit of time here, and I'll give you a call back. Clearly, if I'm going to do this... God, damn it. I'll need to find a way around Big Chicken. Out of business. But finding an independent hatchery is easier said than done. How many birds do you need? How many birds could I get? Murray McMurray is one of the few remaining independent hatcheries in the U.S. They've been hatching chickens for over a century, and offer over 100 different varieties of birds. But today, I'm all about the broilers. Also known as meat chickens. Also known as the most popular chicken on earth. Your chicks are in here. Look at you, you're out. Aww, good job. Good job getting out. Happy birthday! In six weeks, these guys will be ready for the dinner plate. Wow. Let's go meet your friends. This little guy, he's just one of more than 9 billion broiler chicks hatched in the U.S. each year. Come here. Their sole purpose in life is to grow fast and to get in our bellies. That is so incredible. Your birds are in here. Oh, man! That is a lot of chicken. Look at all my guys! Holy cow. These are Ross crosses, large, double breast, fast-growing breed. Any other kind of fast-food restaurant, they'd have these same kind of chickens. They would have the same kind. And if you go to the grocery store, this is what you would be buying. They're especially bred for the meat. These chicks are the result of 70 years of cutting-edge scientific research and selective breeding. It's like Easter. What did the time to market used to be? - Sixteen, twenty weeks. - Wow. From 20 weeks to 6 weeks. Just selective breeding. Over the years, they keep breeding a day off every year, and they just keep bringing it down and down. That's incredible. And while society continues to strive for gender equality... We'll get set up to sex these birds. ...with Big Chicken, it still pays to be a man. Because the males grow faster. And faster means more money. So, if I want to get more bang for my chicken buck, I want to get more male chickens. Correct. This is the Marek's vaccinator. The piston here will push this hypodermic needle-- - Just like that, right? - There you go. - Have you ever been poked by that? - Yes, it hurts. One down. So we hear a lot about birds that are pumped full of hormones. You know, most of that is a myth. OK. These chickens grow fast enough - the way they are naturally... - Yeah. ...that they don't need those hormones. 2,600 chickens. You're now an official chicken farmer. Awesome. Thank you so much. Hi, let's talk about being outside today. It's going to be a really nice afternoon, lots of sunshine is coming our way. It's gonna be a beautiful day with a high near 81 degrees. Might end up with a quick shower, but 78 on Friday, and 80's again rest of week. ♪ Ain't gonna do no plowing ♪ ♪ Ain't gonna plant no seed ♪ ♪ Ain't gonna feed no chicken... ♪ Jonathan Buttram is the president of the Alabama Poultry Growers Association. With 38 years in the industry, Jonathan, his wife Connie, and their son Zack have grown for several of the biggest poultry companies in the country. Jonathan has agreed to rent me one of his 14 grow houses and help me raise my chickens. ♪ Ain't gonna spread no seed ♪ How you doing? Hey. Jonathan Buttram, nice to meet you. John, absolute pleasure, man. Thank you so much. - Great to meet you. - Great to see you face-to-face. You look like a country boy. I'm--I'm a hillbilly, it's what happens. When you're from West Virginia you don't have a choice. Exactly. If you're from West Virginia you don't have a choice. This is a big space. This is gonna be home base for my chickens? This is home base for your chickens. That's fantastic. We think you're gonna do great here. You're home! Home! - Right over here? - Yeah, we want it that side of the water line. OK. There you go! Yay! Home, home, home! Oh, so you're much less delicate than I was. That will actually stimulate 'em. - It will stimulate 'em? - Yeah. I really don't want to walk. Why are you guys chasing me? Oh, I'm your mama. Mama! This is where you gotta watch about stepping on 'em. Uh-oh. Holy cow. There are so many chickens in this place. Get out! Get out! Get out! They're, like, surrounding me. He's mama! Go, go, go, go, go! Last guy! You're home! Home, home, home! Whoa. - Did y'all hear a pop? - Did you step on that guy? Yeah, he ran under my foot when I... Wow. So they're running under our feet, getting all around us. - Yeah. - It's really hard not to step on 'em. Right. Compared to most of the industry, my chicks had it pretty good. You see, most grow houses pack in more than ten times as many birds. That's less than one square foot for every chicken. So, in your new chicken house, how many chickens are in there? There's, uh, 28,000 in each chicken house. Six flocks a year, sometimes seven flocks. Wow. Now, I would love to show you what 28,000 chickens actually looks like, but Big Chicken locks their farmers into ironclad contracts which strictly prohibit outsiders, like me, from entering their grow house. So while I can show you this... for Jonathan's sake, I can't show you what's actually happening on the other side of these walls. It's about numbers for the industry. Getting the most amount of chickens grown out, in the smallest amount of space, for the least amount of money, so they can make the most amount of money. That's the secret. Hello, my chickens. I am your chicken father. This is going to be the best time for you guys. You have one job to do, now that you're here. That's right, you have one job. That's to eat as much as you can and do absolutely nothing. Are you guys excited? Who's excited? It's your daddy! The Beatles, this is how they must have felt. Now that my farm's up and running... OK, now we're going back the other way. ...I need to hunt down a restaurant location. Taco Bell, Papa Johns... Smashburger, McDonald's. Ooh, look at that Arby's. That's a fancy Arby's. And where better to do that than Columbus, Ohio? This is like fast-food strip right here. The test market capital of America. That's the first free-standing Chipotle I've ever seen in my life. See, Columbus has everything. - How you doing? - Hey. We've got freezers, coolers, Amish-built bar, music up here, and-- So has it been empty for two years? - Yeah. Yeah. - OK. So in an industry where most new restaurants don't last a year... Um, it feels like it was a strip club. There's a dance floor over there. ...what's the secret sauce that fuels those lucky few to succeed? I love that they put a menu over another menu. For starters, they're probably offering food that customers actually want to eat. So, if you were gonna order a chicken sandwich, what type of chicken sandwich would you most likely order? It'd be a crispy chicken. Crispy, of course. Why a crispy chicken sandwich? It just tastes so good. It's got a nice spice to it. Are you gonna go grilled or you gonna go... Most likely fried. You know, I go to, uh, Kentucky Fried Chicken every once in a while. - Yeah. - And get a half a bucket and sit there, and the next thing I know, I-I shouldn't have did it. Right. See, we know we should probably get the grilled but we don't. Why? It doesn't taste as good. So in our brain we're telling ourselves we should order the grilled chicken sandwich, but our actions... Go the opposite direction. Yeah. Why is that? I don't know. I think healthy food depends on the definition of health. What do you mean by that? So, we started to see health change and evolve based on health halos. What is a health halo? What's that mean? Well, a health halo is when there are terms associated with certain product that--that make it feel healthier. OK. So give me some examples. So examples would be "fresh" and "natural." Um, "hand-crafted" has become big. "Artisan." "Homemade," "scratch"-- things where consumers feel good about the food and the ingredients. Even when I deep-fry it? Even when you deep-fry it. That's incredible. The term "fried" has evolved to "crispy." - Fried has a very negative halo around it. - Right. - So let's talk about my restaurant. - OK. - Can it be fried and also be quality? - Sure. In fact, younger consumers see quality ingredients and transparency as better for them. So, for example, what are the additives, preservatives? Was it sustainably raised? - Was it free-range or cage free? - Right. This is what basically gives them their perception of health - that becomes their reality. - Yeah. But generally, they're led by indulgence and craveability, so when they go out, 90 % plus of consumers are going after the fried or crispy food, versus the grilled. So how many fried chicken sandwiches are sold in the U.S. every single year? I would venture to say... it's close to a billion sandwiches. A billion chicken sandwiches a year? - Yeah. - Wow. So the fried chicken sandwich... It's a good business to be in. Yes, absolutely. When was the last time you ate a grilled chicken sandwich? Probably never, man. I'm not gonna lie! Probably never. Anything that's healthy doesn't taste good. It's not, like, sizzling and making a pop sound, it's-- - I don't see myself eating it. - Yeah. So if everybody wants the fried sandwich... Take the fried, every time. - ...and nobody wants the grilled sandwich... - Not me. But everybody wants the idea of getting something healthy, can you just kind of bring those two worlds together? Is there a way to make a healthy fried chicken sandwich? It's a grilled fried chicken! It's a grilled fried chicken. Well, actually this is a fried grilled chicken. You're gonna see fried grilled chicken and grilled fried chicken. So this one, we wanted to showcase the fried, then the grilling. Fried grilled chicken? - Yes. - Really? Yeah. I encourage you to taste that. Remember that taste is a huge part of it. - Mm-hmm. - If it doesn't taste good, - you're not getting a business. - Hmm. But I mean, how can I present the fried grilled chicken sandwich as being... better for you. - Let's see what happens... - Yeah. ...and have a chef create one of those - and see what that's like. - Sure. So we have spicy mayonnaise. Health used to mean low fat, low calories... That's nice. And now, health is about what are the good things or the kinds of ingredients that you're using. And all those fresh green herbs - really do give a health halo. - Yeah. OK. Pickled vegetables. This is daikon, onion, and carrot. So they are fried in the potato and panko coating... and then they're grilling it in a Panini press. To make this fried chicken feel healthier, CCD is surrounding the meat with a halo of all natural, local, and artisanal homemade slaw and fresh green herbs. That combined with pressed-on grill marks at least gives the perception that this is a healthier chicken sandwich. But the big question... How does it taste? So we have the grilled crispy chicken. For this one, we increased the spice on the spicy mayo, and this one, we have a mustard sauce. - Great. - Are you ready to taste? - Yes, please. - Perfect. Here we go. We're actually gonna taste the mustard one first. Oh, man... the mustard sauce is good. Oh, my God. That's like one of the greatest things I've eaten in my life. That slaw pickle mix is really nice. All those fresh green herbs. - Yeah, that already looks like a healthy sandwich. - Mm-hmm. I'm wondering what isn't letting us get the grill marks. Our grill, our Panini press, if it burns it, just so you get the char marks, it's gonna overcook the chicken. See, the problem is I feel like we need grill marks on it to hammer home the healthful-looking sandwich. Mm-hmm. If you really want char, or grill marks, pardon me, you can paint them onto this with dark food coloring. You're a--you're a smart one. OK, so we're getting ready to do the next one? Mm-hmm. We're creating the ultimate health halo. Let's try this. This is the spicy? This is the spicy, yeah. Like three seconds in, it starts. Mm-hmm. You feel it, you get the kick. That is a craveable flavor. That's a great sandwich. For the spicy crowd, you've got something. For the non-spicy crowd, you've got something. Both feel very craveable to me. So let's have a conversation of how healthy are our sandwiches. Um... I think--I think that answers my question. Morgan, you know I'm not a nutritionist, but I would assume if you're deep-frying something you could be heavily criticized and perhaps see a backlash for that. I just want you to know that. But everybody in America loves fried chicken. But--but you-- But I think that if you start going down a path of super, super healthy - nobody wants to eat it. - Mm. OK. Well, you're gonna have to do something that makes it healthier. Right. What are your guys' thoughts on... Obviously, fried chicken is never gonna be amazing for you, but if you are showcasing all of the ingredients and being transparent about it, that's where I think it can be interesting to consumers. I think that's the big thing, is what's the story behind you and the chickens? You really have to be clear on what kind of chicken you're serving. Yeah, the chickens are blank, or the chickens are this. Are the chickens that you are sourcing high quality and free range, and things like that. Are you looking at organic? Or are you... Probably not. But what if--what if the chickens that I serve... are vegan? Yeah, I don't know how that works. Home of the vegan chicken. - So there you go. - I like it, actually. I kind of love that. Um, but I guess the point being, Morgan, the better the chicken, and the more claims you have, the easier and better it is. - To tell that story. Yeah. - A hundred percent. Oh, my gosh, they're so big! They're outgrowing their feathers. - That's why they're bald. - That's good. They're growing so quick that the feathers can't catch up. Holy shit. So if almost of the chicken consumed in America comes from the same type of bird, then how do you make the actual chickens better? So, the thing that I'd really like to figure out is how do we make them free-range? If we do that, we have to really be careful about what we do with this type of chicken. OK. These birds are bred to grow... indoors. They're sort of like sissy birds. If these birds went outside, and it'll be a 120 degrees outside this house right here, they're gonna die from heat stress. - Kill these chickens just in a few minutes. - OK. But if we gave them shade, with like-- what's the smallest space we could give them that would still be quantified as free-range? You know, I really don't know the regulations on that. - Hello. - Uh, yes. Is this the USDA? It certainly is. How can I help you? Uh, so I have a question. I have a, uh, I have a small chicken farm down in Alabama, and we're looking to raise my chickens free-range. And I just wanted to understand everything that I need to do, uh, to kind of fall within USDA guidelines. OK. The written description of the housing conditions is reviewed to ensure that the birds have continuous, free access to the out of doors for over 51 % of their lives to the normal growing cycle. So does that have to be full-time? Even when it's 100 degrees outside? Or is it time in the morning when it's cool, then they come back in during the heat of the day, then they're allowed access again in the evening when it cools down again. Right. That--that's fine. - That's fine. - That's fine. And is there anything about the size of the enclosure? Not that I'm aware of. I'm not seeing it has any designation here in the information. - OK. - And I'll send you all the details. Awesome. I really appreciate it. Thank you so much for your time. - Not a problem, have a good day. - Have a great day. Bye, bye. Let's see what I got. Hold on. USDA permits the term "free-range" if the chickens have access to the outdoors for at least some part of the day, whether the chickens choose to go outside or not. So, ultimately, they don't have to go outside, as long as we give them the option to go outside. - Right. That's right. - Then they're free-range. - That's what I understood. - OK. Better watch your fingers. Let's move it over here. Ready? OK. Should I just push this side in? Yeah. We're done. They have access to outside. That's it. Here it is. Free-range. Come on, come check it out. Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Yeah, go check it out. What's over there? They're afraid to cross the threshold. But they are curious. Yeah. Come on. Hey, go outside. Check it out! Look, you're free-range. They're still considered free-range if we're, like, trying to force them to go outside? I think right now we're just letting them know. Come on. Come check it out. Check it out. Check it out! Check it out, free-range chicken. You are living the chicken dream. Look at you, you're a free-range chicken. Go tell all your friends. This guy's like, I want that shade. Go check it out, guys. Pretty sweet. Or don't. Doesn't matter. I know. Free-range chickens are supposed to look like this. Or this. Or maybe something like this. That's what I thought, too. But it turns out there's no enforceable legal definition for what free-range chicken actually is. Which way is the meat department? You see, the poultry industry is highly competitive. Natural breast, no added hormones. And Big Chicken is determined to convince us that all chickens are not created equal. Better feed, better taste. Chicken raised without antibiotics. More than delicious, a way of life. Moist and tender. Mmm. So if it works for them... See, there's an actual picture of their real farm. ...shouldn't it also work for me? There's a lot of things I can say about my chickens. I mean, it's not really cheating if Big Chicken makes the rules to the game... right? I've got to fill out the USDA application than enables me to label my chickens certain things. So name of product is Morganic Fresh Farms. Since my chickens are already on a non-organic diet that includes pork meat... It has some pork in my chicken feed. Pork-fed chickens. ...sadly, that means they can't be called organic. But what else makes people think that chicken is better? If I had a chicken farm called Morganic Fresh Farms, what would you expect those chickens to be like? I'd expect it to be Morgan's highest quality chicken. - They're natural. - Natural, all natural. Natural. - What does "all natural" mean? It was born in the wild. Eating corn, living life. - All natural - 100 % natural. 100 % natural. All natural is the most misleading claim on meat and poultry products. All natural is really organic? Organic, I guess. The average consumer appears to think all natural is very similar to organic. All natural, organic, it's the same. How the land is treated; how the animals are treated; what they're fed; whether they get antibiotics. It means none of those things. All natural, according to the United States Department of Agriculture, means minimally processed; no artificial ingredients. Only means what happens to the product after the animal is killed and has nothing to do with how the animal is raised. So, all natural. Hormone free, what does that mean? They don't put hormones in the food to make them grow faster. That's where they inject the chemicals into a chicken. I think it absorbs into the muscle, into the fat of the chicken, then the meat. We eat that. And I'm one of those people at the grocery store that will buy-- spend the extra and buy the no hormone-injected meats and I do the best I can. Without any added hormones. Grown with no added hormones. By law, poultry cannot receive hormones. And yet, producers can make that claim. Well, Foster Farms Chicken has no added hormones. Well, I wish you didn't have any added negativity! No hormones added. - If a chicken is cage-free, what does that mean? - Cage-free? Cage-free chicken would be a cousin of a free-range chicken. They're still within quarters but just not in those small, little containers. - And that's good, right? - Yeah. Cage-free. We consider that misleading. Meat chickens in the United States have never been raised in cages. Cage-free. What about a label that says "humanely raised." What does that mean? Uh, it's not raised in a cruel, unnatural condition. Like, if you're gonna eat meat, I'd rather it be, like, - ethically treated, you know. - Yeah. Then for some things, like humane, they allow the producer to define the claim. So I'm gonna say humanely raised means... chickens raised humanely on a family farm in a stress-free environment. Our farmers always handle the birds with care and respect. So now my free-range, cage-free, no hormones added, humanely-raised, 100 % natural chickens can get the USDA's seal of approval. Some pretty good bullshit right there. If you put your faith in government to be looking out for what's in your food, then you're--you're putting yourself into an experiment. And the USDA, there's no funding. They can't afford to test anything, so they don't. If you vouch for its safety, we're good, you know. They rubber stamp it. So when people say... we're only selling people what they want, is that true? - It's absolutely true. - Yeah. 'Cause they're constantly, ear to the ground, what do people want? GMO free, free-range, humanely raised, like, all these terms are coming out of the people that are the activists, and then they get adopted really quickly by the companies. Yeah. It's kind of like the '70's, when the whole peace-love movement became, like, lunch boxes and stuff, and then it was over. Right. What will it take to change the environment we live in? A really passionate... involved consumer that takes advantage of the fact that you can kind of learn about anything you want to, right now. You want to know what's in something, Google it up. If everybody took advantage of that, there'd be clean food, there'd be healthy food, it would change overnight. So I'd like to ask you about what I'm doing. Well, you need a catchy name. Talk about the farm. There is this bucolic notion of what's going on at the farm, still, that Americans have, because we all grew up with our little farm toys and everything. And why do we, as consumers, want to believe that? We don't take in stuff through fact, we take in stuff through stories. So every brand has a story, every campaign has a story. - And your restaurant has a story. - Right. - You gotta weave a good tale. - Yeah. This is my farm. Whoa, whoa, whoa, Morganic? Yeah. Andrew Clark and David Littlejohn run the creative agency Humanaut. They specialize in getting startups off the ground with innovative and outside-the-box campaigns. Hey, foodies. It doesn't get any more local than that. They've agreed to come on board to help me weave my tale. I'm trying to find an agency who can kind of help me fulfill my vision of the ultimate farm-to-table fast-food restaurant. And the whole reason I wanted to raise my own chickens was because what consumers are kind of leaning towards and want now, which is kind of "healthy fast-food." - Right. - So, raising my own chickens, there's nothing more farm-to-table than that. - Are you gonna serve that chicken? - Absolutely. - Chicken farmer. - Chicken farmer. They are free-range, they are cage-free, they are antibiotic-free, hormone-free, - all natural... - Asbestos-free? Asbestos free, USDA certified. That sounds amazing. Until you start to realize how much of that is labeling. And marketing. And it's just kind of... the health halo. Especially like a fast-food restaurant. They've kind of been green-washing, health-washing the dirty, unhealthy truth. They want you to feel like they're being honest, - or you can trust them. - But it's still junk food. Before we get started on slogans and jingles, I need to understand just how much things have changed. First stop, the one place story-wise that Andrew and David think has truly evolved the most. McDonald's. Oh, my gosh. Yeah. This is your first time back, right? This will be the first time I have set foot in a McDonald's in 12 years. - It's a big moment. - Here we are. Oh, my gosh. I'm having flashbacks already. This is a drastically different place than the McDonald's of ten years ago. It doesn't look like any McDonald's I've ever been in. It definitely looks better than those clown castles they used to have. Nice stone work. I mean, that's not cheap. Yeah, but is it gonna taste drastically different? You're gonna let us know. The smell's already wafting out of the doors. Yeah, it really is. Wow. There's nothing in here that makes you think this is a McDonald's... I'd like to get a southern-style chicken. ...except for the way it smells and the fact that it says, like, "I'm lovin' it" on the wall. Thank you very much. Mmm. All right, guys. Here's the goods. So let's take a look. OK. Are we ready? - Let's do it. - Let's go. Enjoy. Glad to know some things haven't changed in 12 years. Oh, whoo. I'm having like... McPTSD. Whoo. This looks very different. This... tastes just as bad. OK, remember when they used to have Styrofoam containers? Now they've got these. That gives you the sense of, like, minimal processing. Yeah, it's very green-looking. This sandwich is called, you know, artisan. If you talked to a true artisan and showed them this... Here, let's take a look. It's not like they have artisan staff back there and then regular staff. One guy makes that sandwich all day. It's made by our artisan. So then this idea of, like, the simpler the better. They're able to kind of create this health halo around the food by calling it simple. And you realize it doesn't mean anything. And look at this chicken. It's like a super nugget. That's amazing. But also, you gotta love the fresh cracked eggs. Cracked fresh in our kitchen... with two hands. I feel better already. You know, it's like the bare minimum becomes the height of, like, look at what we've done. - They said they've heard me. - Yes. - "We've heard you." - Literally talking about you. We've heard you, Spurlock, and now look what we've done. We made a tri-fold brochure. So it's like when you see a word like artisan, fresh cracked egg, the simpler the better, and you just even begin to ask, "What do they mean by that?" It just quickly falls apart and becomes humorous. Got it. - Let's go to the next spot. Oh. Whoo. - What's next? - Here we go! Chipotle. These guys do it better than anyone. It's really simple, raw ingredients. You're gonna see a lot of handwriting, telling the story of where your food comes from. Well, that chip was probably cut, fried, and finished with a squeeze of lime. Maybe those salty little imperfections aren't for you, buddy. What do they do to make that guacamole so radioactive green? Nothing, man, it's natural. It's right there on the cup. And it's that hand-lettered font to give you that handmade artisanal feel, so that you feel better about what you're eating. - Mmm. - Regardless of the astronomic calorie counts. "As they say in the old country, treat thyself. Chipotle." - Panera. - Panera. So Morgan, as we go in here, we encourage you just to pay attention to everything. Every piece is gonna be something you're gonna want to think about, too. Van Gogh bread, Dali bread. The walls, the colors. Very orange. The orange is about vibrancy and energy. Green, you're not just eating natural food. There's chips here, there's cookies... but you're in this comfortable, green, sustainable space. And you can see their mission statement for everyone in here to read. - It's, uh, food as it should be. - Got it. Or, Morgan, you could just do something like a word wall. Words smashed together. They don't have to mean anything. - Quality. - Services. - Col. Sanders. - Chicken. Boston Market. You know, here we got photographs of the farm. You want to feel like your food came from a farm and a farm that looks like that. I know what a chicken farm looks like and that looks nothing like one. Whether or not this is the actual farm, who knows? Yeah. Subway. Eat Fresh. These guys were the first ones to actually show you vegetables. Providing this healthy halo to the unhealthy items right next to it. So I'm gonna get the Oven Roasted Chicken, or I'm gonna get the 1220 calorie Chicken Bacon Ranch Melt. But you're gonna feel better about that... because you're nestled in a salad, right there. And your brain doesn't expect more. That's right. I've got the Oven Roasted Chicken Sandwich but you can see I've actually got grill marks, even though it's from an oven. - But somewhere it was "grilled." - Artificial grill marks. That's something that's been used in the industry for a long time. So despite there being fake grill marks on there, I think it's better for me. - Absolutely. - That's amazing. When it comes to truly washing oneself in the vast green glow of healthy-ish... - Wendy's. - Yeah, here we are. ...Wendy's takes the gluten-free cake. - Welcome to real. - It's real. We're not gonna serve you virtual food. You will have real food. So I'm counting at least four different types of wood grain. My favorite thing in this place is the glass grass. I mean, it screams natural. All the messaging that's on this tray liner. - Because it's different. - Raised on ranches. All-all cows are raised on ranches. Right. With the bakery-style bun. Does this bun look any different to you than it did ten years ago? No, but do I think that because of the cues that are happening in this restaurant, this is suddenly better for me? - Yes. - It's up there nestled between salads. How could it not be better for me? You're actually having a health halo... - Experience. - Yeah. You can't fault a brand for trying to say the best thing possible, but when you're doing all of it to give people a false impression of what you really are... Yeah, from the Baconator. You've crossed a line and you're deceiving people. - You think you're eating that... - Yeah. But you're eating the shitty thing in your hand. Right. Just keep your eyes on this while you-- So, when consumers go into a fast-food restaurant, thinking that the food is actually healthier than it is, what are the dangers of that? I can eat everything I want! As much as I want! And I'll be just fine and the calories won't count. Not the case. Unfortunately, no. I mean, what you care about is the calories, the salt, and the sugar. And those mostly haven't changed. Right. If you show people two of the exact same food, and you label one as green and the other one as not green, they think the green one has fewer calories. - Yeah. - Those studies have been done. And the food companies are counting on human behavior to increase the sales. And if people will buy more because there are salads there. - Mm-hmm. - They'll put salads there. - Yes. - It's their job to sell as much product as possible, maximize shareholder value, and please Wall Street with growth every 90 days. That's their job. What if there was a company that was completely honest with their customers? Well, why would they do that? - Look at it. - Here we go. - It's a Wendy's. - It's real. Looks strangely familiar. - Yeah? And I got the magic key. - All right. - Ooh, yeah. - Wow. - I'll turn on the lights. This doesn't look dangerous at all. Look at this thing. See the mouse trap down at the bottom? All mine. Um, all right. Let's just start flipping and see what happens. - No? - No, nothing. Keep doing that, thought. Hey! We're on--we're in business. Hey, wow, it's even better in the light. Welcome to your fluorescent-lit restaurant. Let's take this baby over. American dream, right here. American dream. There are so many possibilities. Like, will you just look at the wall space. This wall, it's your entrance, right? So have a kind of a--our story. I love the little nooks. I love the windows. - Bringing the nature in. - Yeah. The traffic going by. Good propaganda space, right here. That's right. Chicken farmer hall of fame. We're gonna have lines, and I almost feel we just want to keep that. Definitely like the corral. We have a fryer here, where we'll fry the chicken. That's local water. - Artisanal city water. - Yeah. I love this; small meat; large meat. I love that it's an old Wendy's. We do need to think through our loyalty program. Next! I like it. ♪ With a little bit of chicks in the chicken coop, ♪ ♪ Picking crumbs off the floor ♪ ♪ So who'd suspect a thing from us ♪ ♪ When we chicken walk across the floor? ♪ ♪ When the farmer comes every morning to feed ♪ ♪ Ain't nothing that we want more ♪ ♪ But every night that farmer comes down... ♪ Here we are. Let's go to work. Morning. How we doing? Look like you growed some behemoths. I can't believe how big they are. Should we weigh a couple? See how they're doing? Yeah. - Six one. - Six one. - That's a big bird. - Come on, buddy. Six pounds and one ounce might not seem like a lot. That is until you get a better perspective. You see, if we humans grew at the same rate as the modern-day broiler, a two-month-old baby would weigh in at a whopping 660 pounds. That... is a big boy. When they sent over my Ross 308 chicks, they sent over a little, small white chicken. But as these have grown, this one didn't grow. He was right out here a second ago. Here he is. He's fast. He's like a road runner. Now, that was impressive. Come here, big boy. There you go. This chicken, just like God made him. That chicken-- - Just like Dr. God made him. - Yes. And you can see he's gonna keep growing like a normal chicken. And this is how big my Schwarzenegger chickens have been bred to grow. Six times the size. They'll get up and move a little bit and then they'll just drop. But that kind of rapid growth has come at a heavy cost for some of my birds. Here we got three dead birds, right here. They're starting to have heart attacks because they're so big. There's one. Let's keep looking. Here's another one. This one got his leg up in the air. - Probably had a heart attack. - He's even stiff. Like, rigor mortis has set in. There's another dead one. A lot of chickens, when they're growing really fast, they'll form a fluid around the heart, and they'll die with a heart attack. If they weren't having any heart attacks, we'd say, well, they're not growing too fast, there's something wrong. It's not often you hear, they're doing well so they're having heart attacks. Right. Which is a good thing in chickens. See, bigger is better. - It's the American way. - Bigger is better. As with any bird that is supposed to grow, you know, so fast, - Yeah. - You can have a lot of problems with their growing. You can have obesity. Bone issues. Sudden death syndrome. Heart attacks. Gumboro disease. Newcastle disease. Salmonella, infectious Bronchitis. Mycoplasmosis. Many different strains of E. Coli. Campylobacteriosis. Pasturellosis. Or green muscle disease. That is so wrong. So, where should we start? Well, I would like to start with an autopsy. OK. Here is your sample of mortality, right? Yes. OK. Oh, let me tie you up. My chicken necropsy kit. OK, chicken. This checks for salmonella or E. Coli. This is the breast muscle, right. Now, this is a very large bird. They're nice, white, plump, and juicy. All of these birds are very large and well-fleshed. Oh. Routinely these hip joints in these chickens are necrosed, one of the emerging diseases that came up when these birds started getting so large. Sometimes it breaks totally. - Other times... - It pops off. Yeah, it just pops right off. - Here we do have a little curve. - Mm-hmm. That could be potentially linked to the weight of the bird. This bone is brittle, it fractured. They just can't support themselves. Exactly. So this is a common thing. I see it a lot in these larger birds. - Would that have caused its death? - No. Oh, why did you die? Now we're going to open it up. Let me get my coracoids' crunchers. OK. - The heart muscle seems to have failed. - OK. It's just a normal thing, pretty much run-of-the-mill. This is very much something you only see in these types of bred chickens. - Yes. - Yeah. They're growing really, really fast. - So it puts a strain on the heart. - OK. But I think you've got a pretty healthy flock, here. They're going to be safe to eat. I'm facing the same thing everybody else does. - Yes. - Yeah. So I just got a letter sent to my office and I'm just gonna read it to you because it's pretty unbelievable. "Good morning State Poultry Federation Reps, I wanted to make you aware that Morgan Spurlock from "Supersize Me" is working on a documentary with a working title of 'Chicken.' He's been calling companies with vague inquiries about what it takes to become a grower. Spurlock has also reached out to bank lenders trying to get information. Recently, one lender mentioned that Spurlock was looking to get a chicken farm calling from a New York number. The lender asked if he was the filmmaker, and his reply 'yes, and a chicken farmer.'" Are you a filmmaker? Am I a filmmaker? Yeah, and a chicken farmer. Then it goes on to say, "It is unclear if he is working with any activist or other groups. We will keep you apprised of any new developments but wanted to make sure you were aware and alert. If you have any further information or know people who have been contacted, please let me know. Thank you, Thomas Super, Senior Vice President Communications the National Chicken Council." Now, the National Chicken Council is the big lobby group for Big Chicken. Like, every Big Chicken company gives money to them to kind of help them lobby on behalf of their interests in Washington and beyond. And so, the reps hand-deliver these letters to the farmers, and that's how I got it. A farmer read the letter, saw my phone number, and called, and the farmer said, "Listen, it says here you're looking to buy a farm. We're struggling, we're trying to make ends meet. If you want to buy one, buy mine." It's all so bizarre. The fact that all these companies are colluding together to kind of talk to the National Chicken Council to kind of block me from talking to farmers, to growers, to getting chickens, to banks. It's like, you have to ask yourself, what are they trying to hide? I call, basically, the chicken industry one large mafia. - Yeah? - Myself. There's even the possibility they're gonna retaliate against me for speaking out. Thank you. 'Cause they don't want anybody telling about what's actually going on inside the chicken companies. Yeah, explain to me, what do we not know? What do I, as a consumer, not understand about the chicken business? I don't think a consumer understands anything about it other than what they see in a grocery store. Mm-hmm. I see a chicken that I get to buy, and I get to take home, and that's it. That's right. That's all you see. You don't see... maybe, how sick those chickens were at times. You don't see... - how mistreated the farmer is. - Yeah. We used to get paid, just like, so much a pound. - Yeah. - And everybody basically made the same. Now, the way that they pay the chicken farmer, they have him competing against other farmers. Right. The grower that has the best bird, - he gets the top pay. - OK. And from the top pay to the bottom pay... is a lot of money. - Wow. - Yeah. This is called the tournament system. The tournament system is a merit-based competition that pits farmers like Jonathan against other growers. It works like this. Each farmer's performance is ranked according to a formula which factors in things like how much the birds weigh, how much they eat, and how many total chickens actually made it to slaughter. Big Chicken makes the farmers compete for a set amount of the chicken pot pie. And farmers who perform well earn more money per pound of chicken. Farmers performing poorly earn less. But here's where farmers think it becomes unfair. Remember, Big Chicken dictates every aspect of how the chicks are grown. So if you get a flock of sick birds, doesn't matter. If the company ships female chicks that don't grow very big, tough luck. If your birds won't eat the stale feed they're delivered, well, that's just too bad. So there's technically competition, but to farmers like Jonathan, the whole system just feels rigged. I hate the tournament system. It's terrible. They figured out a legal way of stealing from people. - Right. - And making them more money. But the arguments from the industry will be, we live in a capitalistic society, you know? We're a business, we're supposed to make money. So from their standpoint, and they say listen, we're just trying to make as much money as we can. What's wrong with that? Well, there's not anything wrong with making as much money as you can unless you're doing harm somewhere else. And they're doing harm somewhere else. - Yeah. - If you are on the bottom in this ranking system, there's not enough money to pay your payments, your electric bills and all that. And too many times I've seen a young farmer borrow all this money then lose everything he's got. It's--it's not right. - Thank you. - Nothing we say counts. We have no input, no say. When you speak out, what happens when... they basically try to punish you, I guess, in some way? With the tournament system, it doesn't take much to go from top to bottom. Integrators can manipulate the paper, the feed, actual chicks coming out of the hatchery. They can pick the bad flocks of chicks, bring 'em to your farm, and you won't do very well. Yeah. I did a newspaper interview, and after the interview, my pay dropped 5,000 per flock. - $5,000 a flock? - $5,000 a flock. They get it in for you... they're your worst nightmare. The tournament system is used by all the major chicken companies. And according to the National Chicken Council, quote, "Everyone benefits, including the farmers, who are compensated according to the quality and care of their chickens." They also claim, quote, "Chicken farmers are happy and in many cases feel more secure in the current system." Growers are accusing Tyson Foods of rigging the way they are paid. Ten farmers sued the company in Hopkins County, claiming a tournament system used to pay them is being used against them. Can you break down, kind of, what the--what the claims are? What are you guys claiming in the lawsuit? Well, basically, what we're--what we're saying, Morgan is that, um... the tournament system is patently unfair. - Mm-hmm. - If you're gonna have growers compete against each other, everybody has to be treated equally. And that's not even close to what's happening in this case. - Yeah. - More often than not, Tyson manipulates the variables that are used to rank these fellas. How many houses do you have? I've got 52 chicken houses. - Fifty-two? - Yes, sir. We'll have one do good, one'll do bad, one'll do good, one'll do bad. One will stay in the middle. It's just a roller coaster. You could sell one farmer birds this week and be number one. And then eight weeks later-- It don't have to be eight weeks. You could sell a farmer birds next week and be dead last. So when something like that happens, what-what changed? My water didn't change. My settings didn't change. My--You know, we didn't change anything. The temperature's the same, the water consumption's the same, everything's the same, but the only variables is the chicken and the feed that you get. It's the variables that you get from Tyson. Yeah, so you go from being a great chicken farmer to a terrible chicken farmer. A-a-and... six months down the road you can be out of business. We hear the same complaint from all these growers, all across the country. They're saying the same thing. - Yeah. - And it tells me... that they're a victim of the same corrupt, rigged system. Tyson's got an incentive to make sure that these guys stay - in debt. - Why? Because then they have control over them. They know a man in debt, you know, is-- he needs that next flock of chickens to-- just to survive. Did they ask you for anything in particular when you get those contracts? Yes, sir. I've had to put in new heaters in order to keep up with the contract. That was about an $80,000 upgrade. - New controllers. - Yeah. New lighting and stuff when I got my last contract. You get barely above the water and that's where they want you. Or you gotta upgrade for the next contract... and--and so you're back in debt. - Thanks for doing this. - Sure. So, um, when did you work at Tyson and for how long? I worked for Tyson Foods for well over five years. I was a field representative. I saw several things that I didn't... didn't agree with morally, where certain growers were treated... differently than other growers, and I have seen the system being manipulated. What were the incidents that stand out in your mind? Uh, certain supervisors instructed me to go out and to make sure that I used every available option I had to control contract grower farms. Tyson and other integrators will force upgrades when they're not necessarily needed as a control mechanism to keep people under their thumb. So Tyson purposely keeps farmers in debt? In my opinion, the debt is encouraged. Then why do you believe Tyson... rigs the system? To simply control. If you're running a business, don't you want as much control over that business as you can have? One of the greatest things that we have to sustain is our relationship with our farmers. Because without that relationship we don't have a business. Our relationship is the cornerstone of who we are. Tyson is controlling family farmers. And that's probably what hits me the hardest... They care about what they're doing out there. It's their house, it's their livelihood. ...because they're in my community. These are people that I've known for multiple years. I've known their children. I've watched some of their children grow up. Our farmer partners are critical to our success. We're critical to their success. That's their livelihood. You know what really gets under my skin, is when I have to watch a commercial about somebody saying how big we're a family farmer and how much we support these guys, and you really don't do that. Don't lie to my face. Once you build that chicken house, enter into that agreement, then you're trapped in that system. The farmer... he's an indentured servant. I mean, he owes all this money and the only way he can pay it back is through growing chickens. There have been many... uh... men and women... who have left as broken people. It--it's just a vicious cycle. They want to keep you enslaved. It used to be good, though, Morgan, it really did. Yeah. So how much debt are you carrying right now on 'em, on all the houses? On all the houses, I'd probably say right around and-- around $4 million. - Four million? - Yes, sir. I mean, I'm carrying... this corporation on my back. Along with every other honest, hardworking family farmer in the country that's growing chickens. We're on call 24/7. We didn't go anywhere away from those chicken houses for ten years. Man, I've--I couldn't even tell you. Family reunions, I mean, Christmas Day with the family. I placed chickens two days after my son died. I can't tell you the stress level of it. The stress level of-- of dealing with a company that tells you that everything that happens is your fault when you know different. It's all about money. These companies have their-- their thumb on these people. And they know it. And what's sad about it is the growers know it, too. I don't want anybody to live like I do. How is that? Well, I mean... 'cause of this. It's just not worth it. This is a life I wish nobody had to do. Hey. I got your sheets. Settlement on the last flock of chickens I sold. And it has me... 11 out of 11. I'm bottom on the ranking system. - You're in last place? - I'm in last place. But here's your check. Yeah, I'm getting less money, a lot less money. For this flock, it's $11,980. $5,000 they gypped me right here on the ranking system. - Yeah. - $5,000 go a long way paying your bills. Right. It's just one thing after another, constantly. - It never lets up. - Yeah. So with this, like, so-- so you're last place. Doesn't make sense. I had the largest chicken on the sheet. When you see this... is the company trying to send you a message? Sounds like it. They may have found out about, uh, what we're doing now. Usually, anything like that goes on, they'll call and let the companies know. - Mm-hmm. - Hey, there's something going on that you may not know about and so we can't trust anybody. Man, that's terrible. I'm sorry. So you're a third generation chicken farmer. You want your son to be a chicken farmer? Well, I did, but now I wouldn't advise him to. He's wanted to. This is what I know. It's what I was raised in. I'm good at it. I've got a skill to do things that most couldn't, but I watch him get so stressed out when stuff would go wrong or happen that was out of his control, and I don't see myself wanting to do it now for the integrators that I know are here. Yeah. The way that the chicken company is, he can't go ahead and carry this on and be the fourth generation chicken farmer, and he can't pass it on to his son. The legacy's stopping now. Really? Can you grab the drill? We're good to go. We can go ahead and raise the waters. Now, it's wait till the catchers show up. Is it normal that I feel a little bad that I sending my chickens off to slaughter? I think you would be not normal if it didn't affect you. Is it just because it's my first flock, is that why? Yeah, you got used to 'em and you don't wanna see 'em die. If you did this a hundred or a thousand times, it'd just be nonchalant. Wouldn't worry you or bother you a bit. All right, fellas. This is it. How many is in that one? Three. - One more. - Thank you. Come on, get in there. So far, since we've just been gathering them, four have died of heart attacks. Come on, big bird, get in there. It's like all I look at now is everything that has to be fixed; cracks in the walls, things that are all rusted through. The vents have to be functioning; repair the holes; things that are just dirty. Everywhere you touch is just greasy and sticky. The list is huge. Look at those delicious grill marks on there. - Charcoal powder. - Yep. We're going to do kind of a natural looking feel. Fixodent to glue parts. K-Y Jelly, dab it on and it sticks perfectly. Drops. What is this? Glycerin. Now I need the mustard. - Scotchgard. - Scotchgard. I'll do them with Scotchgard. It will give you nice drips down the side. That is the most perfectly placed drip I've ever seen in my life. Little seeds. Little more homemade-looking goes in that farm-to-table kind of feel. Did you tweak that dangler, Jeff? Yes, I did. Man, that is a good looking chicken sandwich. I'm gonna show you a bunch of names. Fantastic. Peep No Evil. Cluck and Dagger. Charred &amp; Feathered. Conspiracy Chicken. Goodbird. Flippin' the Bird. Bird + Bun. Dumb Cluck. Mother Cluckers. And of course, we're trying to create Chicktopia. Chickri-la. So this is a new size cup, right? - Yeah. - Squattier, smaller. OK. Then we've got our handwritten messages on the cups. So there's a red sticker for spicy, green for the regular. - What about the wrapper? - It's brown paper. - It's good. - Approved. Can you tell me the fast-food experience you've had? Four years restaurant management experience. - I'm a cook. - Team leader. Hamburger specialist. - I started out at Chipotle. - McDonald's. - Jack in the Box. - Chick-fil-A. - Popeyes. - White Castle. - Burger King. - Taco Bell. - Wendy's. - May pay is... - $7.25. - $7.25. $7.25 still, and I've been in the industry of fast-food for seven years. There are no benefits. There are no sick days. You can either come into work sick... They'd be sneezing on their hands. Not trying to cough all over everything but... One job is not enough. The working conditions sucks. And that's just the way that it is. If you don't like it, you can leave and we'll find somebody else to replace you. Everyone's replaceable. Welcome to Chicken corporate training. Whoo! Yes! Here's the most important part. The flavor char station, where you install the flavor char marks. And then... boom. Grilled crispy chicken sandwiches. Right there. The char marks on top. Look at your build if you ever have a question. And then just across, right? Great. - Generous. - Yeah, generous. That's a good wrap. Nice job. Well, there is a new restaurant to cluck about this weekend. It's going to be a chicken restaurant. Brought to Central Ohio by Morgan Spurlock. The star of the documentary "Super Size Me." Now he's opening his own restaurant, right here in Central Ohio. ...brown paper covering whatever is going on inside. I hope we get a lot of people to come out and enjoy that delicious grilled crispy chicken sandwich. Grilled crispy chicken sandwich today?

Do you remember that letter that I got from the guy at the Chicken Council in D.C. warning "chicken people" all about me making this movie? Well, I'm in Washington, D.C., to track down Tom Super, the guy who wrote that letter. That's him. Hi, you've reached Tom Super. Please leave a message. The grand opening of my chicken restaurant is this Saturday, so I felt like it's the least I could do to invite him. Hey, how are you?

Hey, how are you? - Good. - Good. - May I help you? - Yeah, I'm here to see Tom Super. - I'll see if he's available. - Cool. Thanks. - If you could wait here. - Oh, wait here? Oh. The way she looked down that hallway makes me think Tom Super just went to the bathroom. Tom's not in the office. - He's not in? He's not here? - No. - No? OK. - Mm-mm. So could I leave you something for you, for him then? Yeah. It's an invitation to a-- I have a restaurant opening in Columbus. So could you pass this off to him? 'Cause I wanted to make sure he was invited to come. Did you take pictures of our logo? 'Cause that's not allowed. - That's not allowed. OK. - OK. - How did you get up here? - How did we get up here? - Yeah. - We took the elevator. How did you get past security? I'm a really nice guy. No, that doesn't work. It's true. It's true. OK, I'll put this on Tom's desk. Put that on Tom's desk. I appreciate it. - OK. - Thank you very much. Joining us this morning... - Morning. You know his face, you know his name. The director, producer Morgan Spurlock is now opening up his own fast-food restaurant right here in Columbus in a building that used to be a Wendy's. Used to be a Wendy's. Our goal is to take over, you know, the bones of old, dead fast-food restaurants all over America. But why are you choosing to start off in Columbus? Well, 'cause Columbus is the test market capital of America, So what better place to taste the Grilled Crispy Chicken sandwich than in Columbus, Ohio? Well, that's something to look forward to. Ribbon cutting's at 10:30, - 11:00 a.m. grand opening. - All right, gonna be something new in store there. Well, coming up, it's Wild Wednesday. Lisa's out checking out four new... Today is the big day. Today we're finally opening. Fast food, fresh, local, healthier. It's long overdue. I'm sure it'll be good. I think it's gonna help change people's lives.

And... we'll find out. Thank you guys so much for coming. Nice to meet you, come on in. Come on in. Thanks for coming, guys. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Thanks for being here. Nice to meet you. I am so excited. Thank you, everyone, for being here today. You guys braved the weather to come here. Now, most of you probably thought that this is the last place that you would ever see me. And, believe me, 12 years ago when I was throwing up out of the side of a car window after stuffing myself with McDonald's, this was the last place I thought I'd ever see me. But... I've had a revelation. After watching fast-food business continue to grow, seeing how these companies say that they're changing, that they're becoming more healthy, that they're becoming everything we wanted them to be. And every year these chains continue to sell us the same tired food, only now, with new and improved marketing and spin. Today is the first step towards total honesty in a lying industry. Today, we tell you everything that they never would. Ladies and gentlemen... I give you... Holy Chicken! Holy Chicken! Holy Chicken! Holy Chicken! Holy Chicken! So that will be the name of it, Holy Chicken! Holy Chicken! I would like to present you this certificate and welcome you officially to the State of Ohio. That is fantastic. Thank you so much. At Holy Chicken! Near Westerville, the line was out the door. Welcome to Holy Chicken! How may I help you today? Could I please do the Grilled Crispy Chicken Sandwich?

Just like the rest of the fast-food industry, we never use the "F" word here. - We never call it fried. - Sorry. We never call it - Even though it is. - Crispy! That way you can feel better about yourself while eating craveable, greasy food. Hi! Welcome to Holy Chicken! Tawanda. Tawanda. Come on up, Tawanda. We'll call your name when your food's ready, but while you wait, be sure and take a look around. See the frickin'... Yeah. Interesting signage around here. Next customer. Welcome to Holy Chicken! - Can I interest you in any of our health halo items today? - Yes, please. All of our items on the board actually have the halo around them, and ultimately a health halo makes our food seem way better for you than it actually is. "We surround our food with a glowing healthy halo." "Which often results in increased consumption." The average Holy Chicken order contains 1,000 calories? Oh, my God. According to nutritionists, it's technically a meal and a half. Next customer. Julia A. - What can I get you? - I'll take a spicy sandwich. Would you like an order of Little Cluckers for your little clucker? - Sure. - All right, done. Crunchy greens and a side of sauce. "100 % committed to goodness by which we mean using words like 'goodness' to make you feel good." Be sure and take a look at our word wall. - All natural? - Fresh. - Artisanal. - Antibiotic-free? - Transparent. - Better. Free-range? Legally speaking... ...they don't mean much. By painting these walls this lively shade of green... We're helping you believe our food is fresh and natural. So... We've got wood to make you think of barns. Healthier. - Locally sourced wood and... shit. - Shh... Feel free to roam around the free-range zone there, OK. - Hey, you guys are in the free-range zone. - Yeah, we're ranging. This is the exact same amount of space we gave our chickens to be free-range. This is so tiny. Luckily, they never go outside, anyway. They get so big so quickly they can barely walk. - Oh, gosh. - Big chickens. Mom, look! Mom, look! Farm to table, technically a giant windowless warehouse with thousands of obese chickens crammed together is a chicken farm. That's so sad. One Grilled Crispy Chicken regular. Feel free to take some time to look around. We'll call your name when your order's ready. Next customer. Welcome to Holy Chicken! How may I help you? Better for you. - Sounds great. - Means nothing. Be sure to take a look around. Honesty never tasted so good. Next customer. Welcome to Holy Chicken! How may I help you? Does this look like that-- the farmer guy? - That's him. - Is that him? That is him. - That's pretty cool. - That's the guy. That's him. Two regular, one spicy. I can't believe I drove all the way from Alabama... for a chicken sandwich. We'll call your name when the food's ready. - Look at that guy. - Hey! How you doing, Morgan? - How are you, man? - Good. Great to see you. This is our chicken farmer. Farmer Jonathan. Let's hear it for farmer Jonathan. That's neat. Wow. Let me get down close for you can see it. Oh, we can see the resemblance without-- Do I look like that guy? You're better looking than him. I was having a rough day that day. You messed up your hair. We actually tell... This is Farmer Jonathan. ...your story. Amazing. And what's happened to you and your battles with Big Chicken. I'm amazed. "If you win, your neighbor is totally clucked!" I never would have thought I would have saw this done. Because people have no idea how they take advantage of farmers. - I'm amazed, I mean... - Awesome. Yeah. - It's great. It's great. - That makes me happy. This means that all the work I've done in the past is not in vain. Yeah. I hope y'all build thousands of chains. Welcome to Holy Chicken! How may I help you? I'll have a regular. Regular Grilled Crispy Chicken? Grilled Crispy Chicken Sandwich for here. And y'all feel free to move about the free-range zone. The fake grill marks. - Seriously, though? - Yeah. And we lightly brush it with charcoal just to give it that grilled look and feel. I love the irony here. So everything's fried to be crisp-- Crispy! Kinda like bullshit, but it's reverse bullshit. That's right. Two crispy sandwiches. Two regular sandwiches, fantastic. - Would you like one of our local beverages? - I'm all right. You're just gonna have the holy water? - Yes. - Also local. Did you see the sign out there? Local just means... It's here right now. - For here or to go? - For here. - Great! - Crispy Chicken Sandwich for here. See, I do it all at Holy Chicken. Boom! Be sure and take a look around. Honesty never tasted so good. Not photos of our actual chickens. Like, those are photos of our actual chickens. I'm not gonna forget this the next time I go eat chicken somewhere else. - That's right. - If I do. I can't finish my meal. You don't want to see that. I'm not sure if I really want to know. You're still eating it. - Thank you, sir. - Crispy! Seeing this living piece shoved in people's faces and the direct contradiction of evidence here is--it's awesome. Take a look around. It's too good to be true! Next customer. How are you, sir? Anything that we can do to make people understand and make different choices is a good thing. But then by bringing this out, wouldn't it discourage people from going to restaurants like this? Mmm. Mmm. Mmmm. - Mmm! - Mmm! How many we got, guys? - We've got lots more orders. - OK. I'm sorry, we were overrun today, but we--we are out of chicken sandwiches for today. We still have the Little Cluckers chicken tenders. Like my father always said, "If something seems too good to be true, well, it probably is." You know what, all you companies out there, you just keep doing what you're doing. 'Cause I'm gonna keep doing what I'm doing, and I'm gonna open more of these. And in time...
