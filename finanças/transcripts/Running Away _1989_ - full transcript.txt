In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, amen. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, amen. - My condolences. - Thank you - Heartfelt condolences. - Thank you - Mama, it's Giovanni. - Ah, yes. May he rest in peace. At least he won't cheat on you anymore. I already forgave him. Did you love him? I married him. You know why? I was tired of sleeping with donkeys and chickens. He came along, he had money. He told me: "I'll take you to Rome." I married Rome not him. Poor man! He wasn't a husband and he wasn't a father. - One, Giova'? - Two, thanks. - No, mamma. - No don't be afraid, Rosetta. They're not going to bomb Rome. They said so on the radio. The Pope lives here. Oh, my God! You can't get any peace. There's no more parmesan, take the pecorino, it's very good with the pasta. It sweetens the taste of the bran. Here. You need more than that to kill the taste of dark pasta, Cesira! What can I tell you? Today, even the spaghetti wears a black shirt. Signora Ferrari, here are some pickled vegetables for you. Just what you need for your stew. Stew? Who can find meat for a stew these days? Oh come on, cheer up! It's good with eggs too. Hey, it's me! When are you going to learn to keep your hands in your pockets? Come on, let me show you what I brought. Come on, come on. Have you got everything? Let me see. Everything. Except the chickens. Look. What a beautiful prosciutto! - And the eggs. They're not rotten? - No, no. Hide it, hide it. Good morning. - Enjoying the cool air, Donna Cesira? - Yes, do you mind? No. He's with the rationing police. He's always hanging around. We'd better wait until tonight. Do you think it's safe to leave everything outside? It's quiet, and besides my stuff, nobody touches! Well, come up to the house and figure out the bill. This is your share, the same price as last time. Now if I can make more... How would I know if you can make more? Can you? - Are you saying I'm holding out on you? - Are you? Are you holding out on me? Why don't you be nice and show me your bedroom? Go home to your wife. She's waiting for you. Why do you care about my wife? I never cared about your husband. You're not looking for a fight are you? Cesira, this isn't enough. I had to pay for petrol. I had to go a long way for your prosciutto. Oh! You want me to pay for your expenses too? You are crazy! Okay! So next time, you risk going to jail... ...for a few pieces of lard. You don't risk any jail. You have too many saints in paradise that's for sure. so don't play the big hero with me. Giovanni! Rosetta will be coming any moment now. Rosetta, Rosetta! It's always the same excuse. Giovanni! Giova', wait! My dear Gino, I did everything I could to help you stay in Rome. How could I know that Colonel Ranieri would also be sent to the front. I'm sorry. Write me as soon as you get there, Gino. I'll worry. You'll see, I'll be back soon. Of course! In a few months the war will be over. As soon as you get there they will send you back, you'll see. They'll even give you a medal. That's how you'll make my future grandchildren happy. Rosetta, I'll see you at home. Don't forget the change. - Gino, ciao. - Bye. Ciao. - Win! - I will. - Ciao. - Ciao. - Goodbye Cesarina! - See you again, Madam Cesi'! - You'll write me? - I swear. Good morning. Is Mrs. Skarleotti in? - Come in. She's expecting you. - Thank you. - My dear, it's nice to see you. - Thank you. What goodies have you brought me? Prosciutto, some cheese and some sausages. Oh good! And I brought you a beautiful rooster from Abruzzo. But you promised me a chicken from Tuscany. Why do you need a chicken from Tuscany? You can't talk to it! Besides, this tastes better. Oh, God bless you! you have everything here. And this refrigerator, it's as big as a house! - It's a "Frigidaire". - Ah, "Frigidaire"! That's what I need for my shop! Look at this ice! How do you put it in the box? It does it by itself. I put the water in, it becomes ice. Amazing, what they come up with! - It's made in Germany. - Where else! But the oil? I don't see the oil. I couldn't find any. Next time, I hope. Please come back soon and bring me everything you can. We will pay you 30 percent more than the others. Yes, I'll come back. With what you have here, you could feed the whole Italian army! Have you heard anything about the Allies landing in Sicily? Don't worry, they will soon be pushed off the island. Tullio, Mrs Cesira is here. No, no don't disturb him, I have to go anyway. You want to get your pay, don't you? - Good day, my dear! - Good morning. Tullio, Cesira brought a lot of things. I don't care, I leave the petty house-keeping affairs to you women. - How much? - 12 hundred Lira. Ah, he's so handsome! The whole world envies us a man like him! "To General Skarleotti". Oh, congratulations! I got this when I was stationed in Africa. As a token for my heroism in Ethiopia. - Here. - Thank you. When you see Mussolini, tell him how much I admire him. Il Duce to you. Oh, I'm Sorry. - I'll see you soon, your Excellency. - No. Use the salute! Every move I make around here is wrong. Excuse me, your Excellency, but you are an insider. Can you tell me if we are going to win this war or not? How else could it be? At party headquarters today, the Supreme Council of fascists meet. A meeting that will go down in history! The party's keeping silent, but they do say the Fuhrer... Your Excellency, a phone call for you. It's urgent! Excuse me! - Let's hope he's getting really good news. - I hope so! - How?! What?! - Excuse me. When?! Oh, God! It isn't possible?! Oh, God! Amelia, we're ruined! Pack your bags! Giovanna! Mario! Quickly, hurry! The photos! And the fur coats. We are ruined! We are ruined! The cards, and money! Your Excellency! Your Excellency! - It's the end! - Your excellency, may I know what's happening, please? What happened? What's the matter? My God, the letters! Signora! Signora! - Giovanna, the mink! - Hey you, come here! - Signora! - My jewelry. Oh, God, what a disgrace! Hey you, stop! What's happening? Tell me! - It's the end of fascism! They arrested Mussolini! - Why, when? He says I'll shoot! - Quick, run away! - What a tragedy, what a tragedy! You want to see that the war is over? I'm taking back my prosciutto. So Giova, these are the keys to my store. Keep an eye on it every now and then, to keep the thieves away. Not that there is anything to steal. - So where are you going? - Well, I have family in Chochara. My mother was there for a while, before she went back to Naples. It's easier to find food there. It's become impossible in Rome.. And then, Rosetta is scared, I have to get her out of here. Bad things are happening in Rome. They arrested Mrs. Levy. Poor woman, she never hurt anybody! Aren't you afraid? I'm not Jewish. Yes, but they're rounding up all the men and sending them to work in Germany. They won't touch me! Sure, because you too work for them. Yes, I sell them coal and I sell them wood. They do me favours, I'm a merchant. Yes, what can we do? We make a living! To everything there is a remedy, except death. Thank God we are alive. You know, taking care of your store these days could be a pain in the neck. - What will you do for me in return? - Nothing. Nothing, eh? Okay! I'll do it for the blessed soul of your husband. - I hope you'll do it for me. - For you? I come near you you bite me. Only if you're rude. But, when you are not rude... Giova'! Giova', what are you closing up for? Leave it open! You still don't know me. Cesi', don't be afraid! I won't be rude. Please. No! Cesira... Giova'! Ah, Giova'! What the fuck are you doing? See who arrives! Hey, don't exaggerate! Break ranks! # If you do not know us, come close # We are the Brigades of Renzo Ballastrini # - Here are the tickets. - Thank you. The train is leaving soon. How much do I owe you, Giova'? You don't owe me anything. Do you have enough money? Yes. My money's right here next to my heart. Everything I have. What do you have there? It's a present for you: champagne. Thank you, Giovanni. Thanks for everything. This how you say goodbye to me? With just a handshake? Eh! - Ciao bella. - Ciao Giovanni. Won't you kiss me? - Rosetta's looking. - She's not looking! - Will you visit me up there? - Yes, yes, of course. But where will you be staying exactly? I do not know exactly. I will write you when I get there. - Ciao Cesi'. Have a good trip! - Don't forget the milk for my kitten! - Don't worry. - Ciao Giovanni! - Ciao! - Ciao! Have a good trip! Ciao! Ciao! Come Rosetta, lean on me, try to sleep. Who knows when we will get there. Give me the other case! Good. - Put this on your head. - On my head? You know, you were born in Rome, but your blood is Chochara like mine. Lift the case like this. Hold it with your right hand! And walk. Walk with your head up! Good. Hey, driver! See how easy it is? What did I tell you? I used to do it without hands. It's not difficult. I'll try. Dear me! Tomasino lives around here, you remember him right? The one who sells us the goat's cheese? Yes. He's a good man. His price was always cheaper than the others. It's so peaceful here! You wouldn't think there was a war going on, would you Rosa? Hey, do you know Tomasino, the goatherd? Everybody's deaf and dumb around here. Or pretends to be. Oh my God Rosa, run! Damn it! Did you see it? They wanted to kill us! For fun! Like shooting at birds! Mamma... Poor man! Don't look, Rosetta, don't look. Poor little donkey! You must be tired! Look at that fine company! - Good morning. - Your health! Good morning. He is Floriano. And I know the ladies of Rome: Cesira and her daughter. - He has told me about you. - Let's make some room here Romana quickly! Two more plates, clean ones! - Rosetta, sit down! - You're welcome. Thank you. Ciao, my name is Aurelio and I'm from Rome, like you. Ciao. There are plenty of others like you here. All refugees from Rome, ...and Frosinone, Littoria... - Mr Varvaro... - Hello! ...He was awarded the 'Order of Merit for Labour'... ...and Miss Noris... - Hello! ...all wealthy people! My wife Filomena... ...my daughter Teresa... - Good morning. - Good morning. ...my youngest daughter, Romana, - Ciao. ...all reunited at this beautiful table... ...celebrating the birthday of the fool of the family. The only one in the family, who wanted to be a doctor, ...my son Michele. Happy birthday, Dr Michele. Thank you. Nice to meet you all. Are you really from Rome, Signora Cesira? Well, I was born around here. I am a Chochara, but my mother was from Naples. I got married in Rome. My late husband, he had a grocery store in Trastevere. We have the same business. I have a grocery store down in the city. Filome', Cesira, she does what we do. You taste these pork chops! They've been cooked on the fire! I don't eat pork, it's bad for my liver. My father refuses nothing to anyone, and especially not to friends. And when the British get here, he'll have some really good stuff again, you'll see! But if the Russians come, all the stores will close down. Hunger must be equal for everybody. What a bore! The same nonsense every day! They know nothing about Communism. They don't even know where Russia is... ...but that doesn't stop them from talking rubbish! No, Michele, you're the one who doesn't know what he's talking about. If you believe in the Russians and Stalin, then you're a fool. No, Michele, I don't believe what Stalin says. Because I know better. The world is made up of smart people and dumb ones! Well, since you have to be smart around here, and I am only the fool, ...I'll leave you to your brilliant conversation. - Michele, come back! Where are you going? - Michele is off to the bathroom! Let him go! He doesn't know what he's saying, he drank too much! - Come on, play that card, no? - That's not how you play Casino! - What are you saying? - You don't know how to play! - I play the ace, here. - One of you has to understand, look! Man! Michele, fighting with your father on your birthday! Aren't you ashamed? Why don't you go and make peace with him? I can't talk to my father. He and mother don't understand me. We are from two different worlds. But your father is very proud of you, Anyone can see that. Who can blame him? To have a physician in the family! I'm not a physician. - You're not a doctor? - Yes, of the arts. What do you mean? It means he's graduated, ...he studied literature, philosophy, art history. Brava. - What's your name? - Rosetta. A beautiful name You see, here if you read and study, they think you're crazy. I can't wait 'til the war is over... ...to escape to a city like Rome or Milan. Ah! You are so young. Why aren't you in the army? I have my own ideals. I am a pacifist. I'm against war and violence. I'm also a Communist. - A Communist?! - Mamma mia, but Communists don't believe in God. Is that so? And what if I told you I was in the seminary? And was to become a priest. Anyway, that's my business, It's a personal matter. Well, I'll see you later. I haven't seen a house as filthy as this in my whole life. Mice, cockroaches, cobwebs! - Ciao. - Ciao. - What's his name? - Cat, what do you think? Do you want to take a walk to the caves? It used to be a hideout for bandits. No, I am busy. - Doing what? - Studying, if it's any of your business. Where are you, you ugly beast? Come here! - How old are you? - Guess! - Not more than 11. - Stupid! - Ciao. - Ciao. Would you like to take a walk up to the caves? - Where are the bandits hid out? - How did you know? Yes, let's go! Mamma, it's Michele! He wants to take us to the cave where the bandits hid out! I have no time for bandits, ...I'm trying to kill a mouse! Where are you? Where are you hiding... Ah! Oh my Virgin Mary! Oh how nice! Beautifully ripe! Rosetta, Michele! Where are you? What are you doing? Oh, look at how many there are! Tell me... who are your favourite writers? The modern poets. Especially D'Annunzio. D'Annunzio has ruined Italy. He invented fascism. And who do you like? The Russians, the English, people who tried to open other's minds. I became anti-fascist, reading Shakespeare. - Is he is a poet? - Yes. Can you recite one of his poems for me? Rosetta. Michele is not an actor! Don't bother him, or he won't take us for walks anymore. I might even become an actor for a nice girl like you. Even reciting Shakespeare. Yes, but she wouldn't understand it, she's still a little girl. The simpler you are, the better you understand. You understand everything, Cesira, even if you are... Ignorant? Is that what you mean? No, I wanted to say that... I didn't go to school, like the rich people. They are the worst! The bourgeois have ruined Italy. I thought you said it was D'Annunzio who ruined Italy. You're such a girl! I'll let you read some other poets, besides D'Annunzio. Let's go home. I have some polenta to do tonight and laundry, come on. Come on. Brava Cesira! You care about what's real. You don't get lost in words. I have no choice. ...one can't live on words alone. I don't live, I just talk. Michele! How do I look? 'Terrible! Careful! Close your eyes, or you'll get soap in them. That's it. Stand up. What a beautiful girl you've become! Before, you used to be all skin and bones. When? When you were little, one or two years ago. Was I that bad? Like a toothpick. - Mama, let me do it. - No, I do it better than you. Look at this sweet little bottom! My baby is becoming a woman. You know that when were you born, I sugared you from head to toe? - Sugared? - Yes, sugar. Really? All over. Most of it there. You never told me that. Well, you can't say these things. But sugar brings good luck, did you know that? And you're going to be a very lucky girl. Now tell me, who is going to take this beautiful girl as a bride? - Cesira! - Yes? - Oh, excuse me! - What's up, Miche'? You should have seen his face! - What are you laughing at? - Michele saw you naked and he got flustered! Stop it Mama, it's not funny! He's not used to seeing naked girls. He's not even looking back. # And when two women marry, who will have room for them both - # And when two women... # - Here, let me. Thank you! You got some nerve you know.? Why? Peeping through windows, spying on naked girls. I swear I didn't do it on purpose. I came to talk to you. Oh sure! I've heard all that before. What are you studying? Nothing. I was reading. - "Madame Bovary"? - "Madame Bovary". - Ah, Yes! - It's a love story. I thought you were only interested in politics. - Yes, but this is a classic. - A classic, eh? - Happy ending? - No. Oh, what a pity! Love should always have a happy ending. What about your love affairs, how did they end? Are you forgetting? I lost my husband recently. Did you love him? I married him. So you didn't love him? - Are you seeing someone now? - That's none of your business! Yes, there is someone in Rome. He deals with materials for heating wholesale. - I understand. In short, a coal merchant. - Yes, something like that. - What do you care? You're upset? - Oh no, of course not. A widow can't have another man? - Of course she can. - So. And you love him this coal merchant of yours? My one, my only true love is Rosetta. I had only one child, but I did a good job. Don't you believe that Rosetta is my only love? Mh-mh. - What the devil? - Merry Christmas, Mama! - Who gave you this? - Aurelio. He says it's the gunpowder from inside the shells. - He found a lot of them in the woods. - But how it stinks! It's smoking us out. Throw it away love. And this is my gift to you. I made it with my hands, and Louisa's loom. Oh Mama. It's beautiful. Thank you. Merry Christmas, sweetheart. I'm sorry the scarf isn't better, ...but I did my best. Mama it's beautiful! What is...? One two three. Why did you put three plates? Because... I thought maybe Michele would come? It's nice thought, but I don't think he will. You know what they say? Christmas with family, Easter with whomever you want. Come on, let's get to the table. - Who's there? - It's me, Michele. Come in. Hello, Cesira. Hi Rosetta. I didn't think you were coming, but I'm glad you have. You're staying to dinner, right? We're having a goose. It's lean, but there's enough for you, right Mama? I'd love to stay, but I'm not alone. I'm with two friends from England. ...two paratroopers, who landed near Rome last week on a secret mission. And you brought them here? Isn't that dangerous? Cesira, these poor fellows have to join their unit. ...but they need food and shelter tonight. My parents don't want to know, they're afraid. Rosetta, put out two more plates. Bring them in, Michele. - Come, come in! - Come. Peter and Ellis. - Hello Peter, Hello Ellis. - And Rosetta. - Hi! - Hello! Take a seat. Would you like to clean up a little bit before you sit down? This is a carob cake. Do you have carob in England? I don't know. It's really horse food, but you know, these days... This, on the other hand, is really exquisite. It's a gift from a friend. Italian Champagne. Great! - You mean Giovanni? - Giovanni. So, Merry Christmas to Giovanni! Not much for me because I get light-headed. - And less for my baby. - Rosetta isn't a baby anymore! - No, she is a child. - Don't you agree with me, Ellis? Rosetta is a very beautiful girl. I want to dedicate a special toast to Italy. Our poor battered and starving Italy! - Long live Italy! - Long live... Long live Italy - Long live Italy! Beautiful Italy! - Dante, Leonardo, Michelangelo. That's right. You know the dead Italians, What about those who are living? What about us? The ordinary living people of Italy. Do you know us? Have you seen these eyes? Look into these eyes. You English, Americans, and Germans you fight and you bomb, - but you've never seen these eyes. - Stop staring, you're making me blush! - Viva Rosetta! - Cheers! - To Rosetta! - To my child! Looking for the comet? It's not going to show up tonight. This year Jesus is going to be born in the dark. One more toast, courtesy of my father. Marsala? That's wonderful! Rosetta, fetch some glasses! - Yes, go! - Yes. - Where did you hide the two Englishmen? - In the barn. - Good. - They were completely drunk. - Really? - Oh, yes. I really should thank your father for this. Better not. He doesn't know he gave it. Ah, you're such a kid! I too am a little drunk. My head is spinning like a top. Cesira, for the first time, since the start of the war, ...I feel happy, thanks to you. And somehow, this time of running away, becoming refugees afraid for our lives ...has become for me like a vacation. I wake up happy in the morning... ...and look forward to the day because maybe I'll hear your laugh. You've helped me so much, to see things more clearly. I'm more tolerant of the others, and of myself, thanks to you. I even feel I can stand my own ...weaknesses. Cowardice. You know too many words, Michele, And sometimes words can... create confusion, like wine. - Let's drink from the bottle! - Oh please, no! Rosetta doesn't seem to be coming. It's good! - I don't dare - Drink! That heat! Oh God, my head is spinning! - What? - Come on, let's dance! - Oh no, I'm not very good. - Yes! - What, without music? - Yes. # But no love, my love cannot disperse with the wind, among the roses # Come on, sing! # But no love, I cannot love, disappear into the wind, the, la... # Mamma mia! You know that song better than Natalino Otto? Michele, what are you doing, eh? Mamma, Michele! They're having fireworks down in the village! Look! Jesus, what a show! Those aren't fireworks. They're flares to illuminate targets. Oh my God! The poor souls! - Open up! - Open up! Hurry! Open up here! - What's happening, Mama? - You stay here. I'm coming! I'm coming! - Hurry! Open up! - You want to break the door down? What is it? What do you want? We are looking for two English soldiers. You have seen them, yes? There is nobody here, nobody! We are two women alone! Get out! What do you want? I told you there's nobody here. Don't touch my daughter! You'll scare her to death! Silence here! You too, get out of here! I told you there's nobody here! Hey, look at this! Come here! - Spumante! - Eh! - One, two, three, four, five persons! - So? Who has been here? WHO?! Wasn't it Christmas for you too last night? Come! - Where are they going Rosetta? - Mama, they're going to the barn. To the barn? Mama Mia! Rosetta, make some coffee. Comrades! Comrades! I'm making some coffee. Coffee with grappa! I make very good coffee. Where are you going, there's nothing here. There's just hay! - Leave me alone! Stop, you imbecile! - Oh my Virgin Mary! St. Joseph, St. Anne and Mary. I heard something. Someone's there! German comrades! German comrades, there are no English here, understand? There's no one in the barn. Fire! - Oh very nice! - We'll eat this later! Oh my God. They're taking my last goose. Damn them! Thank you, thank you! Thank God they took the goose and not your son! Mom, and Michael? Everything is fine, it's quiet now. Run inside it's getting cold. Brr! Now we're going to have a beautiful cup of coffee! # And when the two women marry... # daughters will make room for me who make me an Aunty # And when two women he's married, the room is broken and the Aunty battered # Hey, I've got the mail! Letters and cards! - Let's see... Miss Noris! - Oh God! Who wrote me? Nothing for you. Idiot! You're wicked, Aurelio. - Signora Festa, a postcard for you. - Who could that be? I can't read. "Greetings from Palermo, have a good Summer. Maria." Oh, Maria! I got the card you sent me last year. - Signora Cesira this is for you. - Who could this be from? Giovanni! - Louisa! - Yes? - Is there nothing for me? - No. - Here. - I wonder who it's from? - Giovanna Chiusano! - Ah, run! There's a letter for you too, from Gino. - Gino! My poor little soldier. - My poor little soldier. Give that back to me you idiot! Maybe you'd like me to read it to everybody? Give that back to me right now or I throw this. I'm not kidding I swear! Here take it. Don't make such a fuss. I didn't know you were such a little girl. You're such an baby! And who cares anyway. I've got a girlfriend too and she's in Rome! - Who'd have you? - You say that! Yes, and my girlfriend is prettier than you and taller than you too. She's blonde, with blue eyes. And breasts like this. "Every day I go to your store... ...to make sure that no one has broken in, ... 'even though there is nothing left to steal'. When I go in, I imagine you there screaming like a chicken... ...bringing cheer to all..." What's this? "...taking the opportunity to sell short weights." Slanderer! He's got a lot of nerve! "Luckily, I was taken prisoner by the English almost immediately at..." Oh my God. Rosetta, Giovanni lost his wife. Poor man! She was ill. She ended up suffering. "...I'm always thinking of you. and I hope to see you again soon, ...because they say the allies are preparing an offensive and..." Where?... another black line! - Good news? - Yes. I mean no, I mean no. Giovanni lost his wife. - He's married? - He was. He's a widower now. Your heart doesn't seem broken. His heart isn't broken, Why should mine be? You're right. Michele, do you mind now that Giovanni is a widower? Maybe I do. - Mmm, smell that aroma! - Nice! You know what I do? With a couple of eggs, milk, garlic, parsley. ...I prepare a delicious omelette with mushrooms, just how Rosetta likes it! Oh, help! Michele! - Rosetta, what are you doing? - Leave her alone Aurelio - What's going on? - Nothing. We're only playing. - He was putting his hands on me! - No! Aurelio, you shouldn't be doing this kind of thing at your age! - But we were just... - Go, go. Rosetta, try to borrow a couple of eggs and oil from Louisa, if she has them. Here. She's still a kid. I can't believe she's engaged. Who is engaged? Gino's a friend, a kid like her. I'm sure they haven't even kissed. Rosetta likes older men, ...mostly those with an education from whom she can learn. Just like you! You know, with all your talk of books, she has a crush on you. Okay, I won't talk to her about books anymore. No, on the contrary. She needs somebody to guide her. - To be her father? - Yes, in a way. But soon she'll have a new father, right? What do you mean? Giovanni's a widower now, you're a widow... Oh, you think so? No, well I meant, since you love each other... Of course! We love each other so we get married and we have a proper wedding. Thinking like a priest. But then that's right, I forgot you were a priest! It's true, I was in the seminary. I'm not ashamed of it. I don't deny my past. I was a Fascist too, if you want to know the truth. And then I enlisted. And then I escaped. - And then I became a Communist and... - And then, and then, and then! Tell me, have you ever had a girlfriend? - Me? - Yes - Well, yes. Nothing... - Serious. Like her? Right, nothing serious. No, we won't even think about what happened the other night. When wine goes to your head, you're not responsible for what you do. I have forgotten. You try to forget too. Besides, we should think about Rosetta. What about Rosetta? Don't you know she cares about you? About your friendship? Rosetta shouldn't even think that there was something between us. Besides. Nothing happened. Then you didn't give me a kiss? I don't remember. Really? I gave you a kiss? The coins of the bank are false. Here, uncle. Am I late? Where can I sit? - Sit here. - Thank you. Shhhh! Be quiet! We interrupt our program... ...for a special bulletin from the Supreme Allied Commander... ...in the Mediterranean. Today at dawn, the American sixth army, ...under the command of General Lucas, ...have performed a landing on the beaches at Anzio. Hooray! They made it! Michele! What great news! Rosa! - Rosa! - Michele! Oh, we have to celebrate! Take a glass of champagne. Here it is! Everyone drink! What a beauty! Again and again! Here you go. Me too, don't you have one for me? Brava, beautiful hen. Let's have a little look. What the hell are you doing, you wretch? What am I doing? I'm taking two eggs. I'll pay. Those are not eggs, they're chicks. It's part of the brood yesterday! They are still eggs. Eggs that will be chicks, and then will be chickens. I can't wait for this to become a chicken! Rosetta and I are starving now. Give them back immediately, before they get cold. These eggs are chicks. They'd be more nutritious. I can't believe you don't have more eggs to sell. What about a can of peas? There is nothing left. Anywhere. Thank you. One day I'll do you a favour. That cheap bitch! And over two eggs! Cesira, where are you going? In search of food, thanks to your sister! She doesn't know that it is better to eat an egg today than a chicken tomorrow. I'll come with you. Are you crazy? The Germans are rounding up the old men, even kids. - It's dangerous! - So I don't want you going alone. But I am a woman. They don't know, what to do with women! They're all queers! You stay here Michele and tell Rosetta, when she wakes up, ...that I'll be back tonight, okay? Stop staring after her. You're as silly as a goose. I'm coming with you! Mama Mia, what a mean sister you've got! Are you sure she's your sister? Anybody there? Do you have anything to sell? Milk. I have milk. Do you want my milk? I don't need it anymore. Mariuccia is dead, they killed her. Don't you want my milk? Mariuccia there's more! Mariuccia where are you? Don't you want your Mama's milk anymore? He's an old friend of the family, our lawyer. He's quite rich, and has a beautiful house, you'll see. I'm sure he'll be able to give us something. - Someone's coming. Hide! - Here! Quick, quick! Oh, Madonna, tedeschi! Stop here! There. Fetch it. Hurry! Beautiful eh! Onward! They've gone. Thank God, what a fright! - What was it he was carrying? - A rabbit, I think. A rabbit? - I think we can go now. - Okay! I'm going to break a leg. - How many floors? - It's on the second floor. - Maybe he's not home. - No, I'm sure he's here! He's a bachelor and lives with his old mother. He never goes out. He's got a beautiful home! Michelino, you came to see me, how nice! How are your mother and father? Very well, thank you. Signora Cesira, the Attorney Fazio. Enchant?, Madame. What's he doing? - Lawyer! - Knock, knock! We'd just sat down for lunch. If you would like to join us... Michele, I warn you, I have a guest: I invited a German officer, the commander of the anti-aircraft battery here in Fondi. We must be careful... but if you want to come in, come in. Major Brandt has agreed to honour my table. This is professor Festa, one of our best scholars, - and Mrs... - Call me Cesira. Mama, two more places please. This is a homemade soup... ...chicken and noodle broth made by my mother.. May I ask you where you got this bread? It's the one our troops have. You know how it is, Major, I made an exchange. Your soldiers like our salami so much. Can you tell me the name of the soldier who gave you the bread? Maggiore, si dice il peccato, ma non il peccatore. You know our saying, no? One can tell the sin, but not the sinner! Michael, you know that our dear Major has read and knows by heart.. ...all of our great poets? "Clear, fresh and sweet water..." "...Where she, the only woman to me, rested her beautiful limbs.." Petrarch! My compliments, Major. I love Petrarch. However I seem to recall that your minister Goebbels said: ..."At the word 'culture' I reach for my gun". Mr. Goebbels was referring Jewish culture, ...Which was the plague of our great country. when faced with the nihilism of those Jewish intellectualists, ...I prefer the beauty of life and death. You know what was the greatest aesthetic emotion of my life? No, tell me. During the Balkan campaign, ...I cleaned out a cave, full of soldiers, with a flamethrower. - I'm going to make coffee. - I'll go with you. I experience my greatest aesthetic emotion... ...at the Sistine Chapel, in the Vatican. I've seen it myself. I know Saint Peter's very well. And the Pitti Palace in Florence? And Venice. I am grateful that the war, has given me the opportunity... ...to see Italy. My God, so much food! Can I take some? - Of course I'll pay you. - Help yourself. - A little pasta. - Take it, take what you like. - And a little cheese? - Sure, take it. Professor, how is it that you are here, and not at the front? I'm on sick leave. In fact, you do look a bit pale. Yes, he is on convalescent leave. It's true. I saw the certificate, his father showed it to me. And how many meals like this did your father have to give the fascist officers... ...so no one disturbs your convalescence? You have not done your duty, you are a deserter! He's going to make trouble. The coffee! Quickly, the sugar! My dear professor, You know that I could have you arrested.. ...and deported to Germany? - I assure you I'm perfectly legal, if you want I can... - Coffee's here! Here's your coffee, Major. How many sugars? - Two, he takes two. - Two. One, two. Would you like a liqueur? Major, don't you want to hear one of those songs we always sing? Ah yes, one of those nice Italian songs, sung by Benjamin Gigli. - Ghigli? - Gigli! Benjamin Gigli! "Mamma". # Mother, just for you my song is flying - Sing along! - I don't remember the words. - Follow me. - Sing, sing. # Mother, just for you my song is flying # Mother, you'll be with me, you won't be alone anymore # Why aren't you singing? You're no better than the others. Sing! I can't sing. And I'm not a clown. Ah, you're not a clown? You are a clown! Pulcinella, like all the Italians! All Pulcinelli! You're not only a clown, you're a traitor! You deserve to be sent to the front. You will come with me. Ah, the air raid siren! You are lucky. - Ah! We go to the shelter! - Miche'! Oh God, the bag! - Cesira! - Come on, come on! Here I am, come on! Move! - Hurry, this way! Follow me! - Run! - But where is it? - In the basement. No, no, I'm not going down there. I don't want to die like a rat. Let's go. - So now what do we do? - Come on. Oh God! - Run! - Oh! - Just in time! - Terrifying! - There was a close one! - Are you scared? I guess it would've been better if we'd gone down the cellar. I'm not going to die for this war, it's impossible. I refuse to accept it. You are an extraordinary woman. The bombs have gone to your head, eh? No, it's not the bombs. Listen, even the bombs respect us. They're leaving us alone. - Rosetta! - Mamma! - Rosetta! - Why are you so late, I was worried. There was an air raid, it was a dreadful. Look at how much food I found! - Was Michele with you? - No. Why? Germans! Run! Germans! Do not be afraid. We don't mean any harm. We are leaving the front. We need to reach our comrades at Valmontone. The liberators, for whom you have waited so long, have occupied Fondi. But we don't want to surrender. We are not cowards. We need to eat. Give us some bread and water. Immediately! Calm down! There's no need to shoot! - It's the last loaf that I'd been keeping. - Ah, you are here too, pretty lady. I am not a dog! Give it to me, here, in my hands! Where is the road for Valmontone? It's that way, ...up in the mountains and then down. But the road, where is the road? There's the only the trail through the woods. We'll need a guide. - You. - No! Mama, no! - You know. - I know what? I'm not from here. I used to come here when I was a child. I don't remember. Enough. I said you'll take us. Let's go. I'll take you. I know the trail to Valmontone. No Michele, what are you doing? Very good, Professor. I accept the pleasure of your company. - Move out! - Michele! We can chat along the way. We will talk about Petrarch. With pleasure. You see, I'm not like Dr. Goebbels. When I hear the word "culture" I put my gun away. Farewell. I'll see you tonight. Out, quickly! - My poor son! - Damn! - Will they hurt him? - No, I hope not. You see, I'm not like Dr. Goebbels. Rosetta, don't be sad. Nothing is going to happen to him. A running dog doesn't bite. Besides, that German is just a fanatic. How come he knew you? And Michele, too? Well, we met him at the home of a friend of Michele's... ...when I went to Fondi to look for food. Then you went to Fondi together? He wanted to come along What's wrong with that? Why didn't you tell me? Rosetta, so many questions! You should be happy today. The Germans are running away, and that means that the war is over. We don't have to hide, or run, or starve anymore. We are going back to Rome, to our home. At last! Leave me alone. - Here, let me help. - Thanks, but I've already done it all. You keep him. I've got another in Rome. Can I change his name? Maybe I'll call him Rosetto. You can call him whatever you like, as long as you love him. I'll keep him with me always, and, when the war is over, ...I'll come find you in Rome, so we can go out together. We'll see. If I'm free. Well so long, Aurelio. I'll always remember you. Then I'll call you and we'll see each other. Then I'll call you and we'll see each other. Okay, but I can't promise you anything. I'll be very busy with school and the store... And with Gino. Sure, and Gino. But you'll find another Rosetta. You'll see. I'll call you anyway. Continuing their triumphant sweep along the coast, this morning the allies have freed the town of Littoria, just south of Rome. - Have you had any news? - No. Don't worry, Philomena. I'm sure Michael will be back soon. I'm as sorry as you are for what's happened. I am sure he is with the Americans. Americans? That's what you say! What if he's already a prisoner in Germany? - My poor Michele! - And it's all your fault! He had to make a gallant gesture. This is my address in Rome. As soon as you know something, please write to me. Hey, look, Americans! Hello! - You there! - Thank you! - What is it? - How should I know, Rosa! What do you care? The suitcases! Where are the suitcases? They're here! - Hello! - Hello! How beautiful! Bread and dust. You like American chocolate? It make me thirsty. Do you want some? No, no, save it. It's good for energy. We have long way to go before we get to Rome! We're not going to walk all the way to Rome are we? I would walk on my hands, that's how badly I want to get home. But first I want to go to the Festas. I want to see if Michele is back. Of course he's back! The war is over! You have to think about school. And Gino's will be calling at the house. - Don't you think about Gino? - What does that have to do with Michele? - Michele is too old for you. - And he's too young for you. - Here. - I just wanna know that he's okay. Me too. - This suitcase just gets heavier. - Come on. We're nearly at Fondi. I wonder if there's a short-cut? Hey Joe, take a look at these two beautiful urchins. Do you know a place where we could sleep? There's always my tent, ...If not, take the first house you find that's not been bombed out. It's a present from me, General Frankie LaRocca. - No kidding? - So long! Call us when you've a place! Mamma, look at that poor old woman. Yes. This is where Aunt Amelia lived. And that is the trattoria Gigetto. Or what's left of it. Come on. Who knows who lived here? Let's see if we can get by here. - Here? - Eh! It's not a royal palace, but let's try. Come on. Tomorrow, we'll look for a ride. And you'll see, we'll get to Rome. A little patience, my daughter, and we'll soon be back home. I can't wait to be back in my own bed. This dirty war is about to end. God willing, of course. Sleep, sleep, my daughter. - Rosetta, run! - Help! Rosetta, where are you going?! Don't you see everything is burning? Run, run! I'm scared! Thank the Lord. We could have been under there. Rosetta, my darling. - What language are they speaking? - I don't know. French I think. - Miss, photograph! - Go photograph your sister! - Where are you going? - We're going to Rome. So are we, hop in! - Great! - Thank you! - Climb up, Rosa. - Thank you. - At last, our suffering is over. - Finally! Are you happy? Happy? You know the rules, soldiers! No Civilians in a military vehicle. Get them down! Sorry! He says, we must get down? Can't carry civilians. It is forbidden. - You have to get down. Sorry! Bye! - Bye! Why Mama? You heard, we are civilians. Let's get a move on! It's starting to rain. Can we get in here? Let's see if we can shelter here? Yes, let's see! That's the war. They don't even respect the churches. Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Let's go here. Here on this camp bed. - Hey! - What you want? Get back, we have you surrounded. - Hey, look! Come, here... - No! Rosetta! Rosetta! Help! Rosetta, run! - Get off me! - Help, mamma! - Help, no! - Get off me! - Get off me! - Cowards, get off me! Rosetta! Get off me! Get off me! No! No! No! Oh, my God! My daughter... Can you walk, Rosetta? Come on. Rosetta! Rosetta! Rosetta, stop for a moment. Rosetta! Rosetta, careful! Watch out! What are you doing in the middle of the road you idiot?! Do you want to kill me?! Haven't you done enough harm?! Do you know why we're like this? Because of what your soldiers did to us! Your soldiers, your filthy, disgusting soldiers! They ruined her life completely! No, I'm not crazy! No! Cursed murderers! Sons of bitches! Damn! Rosetta! - Have you seen a girl? - No, no. - Young, dark hair. - No. Where has she gone? Rosetta! Rosetta! Rosetta, speak, say something! Why won't you talk? Are you angry with me? Don't run away, Rosetta. Sweetheart. You haven't said a word all morning. Please, Rosetta. Don't keep your feelings inside. Listen... Hey, beautiful, you want a ride? No, no. We don't want anything. - Come on. Get in! - No, we're on our way to Rome. I'll take you to the end of the world. No. No. What are you doing? Ah, good! Cheer up! The war is over! - Lean on me. Lean! - I said no. Oh, did you hear? This morning, a group of Moroccan soldiers attacked the women at Vale Corso. God. If they touched my sister, I'd tear them apart with my bare hands! Where are you from? Two women alone... ...and on foot. It's dangerous. You should have taken the Via Casalina. It's quicker. Yes. I should have taken the via Casalina. # Live, while we are young # Sing with me! Come on! # Because life is beautiful and I want to live more and more # Hey, you sing really well, did you know that? Come out with me tonight, I'll introduce you to someone who works in radio. What do you say? You'd sing on the radio? My daughter isn't going anywhere with you! We have to get to Rome. What's with you? I'm going to Rome the day after tomorrow. I'll take you there. And tonight, I'll take you dancing eh? We'll have fun! I'll make you laugh, eh? Sing with me! # Live, while we are young # Because life is beautiful and I want to live more and more # Today, this great day, this day of happiness! # My beautiful woman left me! She has left so she can be free! - # Live, while we are young # - Brava! # Because life is beautiful and I want to live more and more # Do you want to have dinner with us? It's only Vincenzo and me. It's country stuff, simple meal. If you don't mind? This is the house. - Do you want to say hello to Vincenzo? - No. You say it for us. We are tired. We want to go to sleep right away. I will try to find you some clothes. You can't go around like that. Really, it's only a room. But it's got everything you need, even a sink. As you can see, it has all the comforts. How long have you known Florino? No, no! No, no, no! Oh, God, no! Rosetta! Rosetta! Rosetta! Rosetta! Where has she gone? Rosetta! What are you screaming about? Vincenzo's still asleep. What's the matter with you? My daughter has disappeared. Have you seen her? I woke up, and she wasn't in her bed anymore. She'll be back soon! Go back to bed.. If you know where she is, just tell me, or I'll go crazy. Don't exaggerate so! She's with Florindo. Rosetta's a girl, Florindo's a young man. They want to have fun. What's wrong with that? She'll be back, go back to bed! Florindo? Are you still here, fretting about your daughter? Think of those mothers, whose sons were killed. Your daughter is having fun, not like the Festa's son. He won't be coming back, that's for sure. Who? Michele? Yes, Michele Festa. He's dead. Killed by the Germans. It's not true. Who told you that? They took him to guide them to the road... ...so, they went up into the mountains, ...to an isolated place, where there was only a peasant family. The Germans didn't take anything to eat... ...and so they ordered the peasants to give them bread, cheese,... Either the family didn't have anything... ...or they didn't want to give them anything. So the Germans got upset and they started to shoot. Michele, who was such a good natured man, said: ..."Stop! Don't hurt these poor people". But instead they killed everyone, even Michele. A little girl survived to tell the story. That's war. War is just disgusting. - Ciao beautiful! - Ciao Florindo! See you tonight, eh? Who dressed you up like that, huh? Who dressed you up like that? Where have you been? What have you been doing all night? Who gave you this? Who gave you these things? Somebody. What somebody? Florindo? Yes. Don't speak to me in that tone of voice! I don't like your tone! And what did you give to Florindo, eh? What did you give him? Did you made love to him? Yes. You know that what you've done is what the whores do! You know? You mustn't do these kind of things! You must go back to the way you were before! How you were before! We're go back to Rome right away! Immediately! But Florindo said... Don't mention that name ever again. Ever! But Florindo has the truck! So how will we get to Rome without him? I'm fed up with walking! From now on, you're going to do as I tell you to, understand? What I say, okay? Do you understand? As I say. Michele is dead. What? He's dead. Aren't you sorry? I thought you loved him. - You don't even care that he's dead. - Yes, I do care. Do you say it like that? Why, how should I say it? Maybe it would have been better, if I had died. It would have been better. - Rosetta! - Oh, mamma! Cry, my daughter. Cry. I'm sorry. Long live the newlyweds! Hooray! Look at them, how beautiful! Hooray! Today we have corned beef, peanut butter, tomatoes from California. ...all from America. - What is this please? - Coca Cola. - It is a laxative? - It's a kind of American soda. - Provolone! - Well, perhaps we'll try one. Okay, pay at the checkout. I also wanted a liter of milk. Powdered milk, fresh from the cow. Milk as a powder? It's for babies And it's good for babies! Look at the Americans. Aren't they big and healthy? Who's next, is it you? Hello. Gino? How you've changed! You too. I almost didn't recognize you. - Gino! - Signora Cesira! Dear, you're back! You look good! Even a mustache. You almost look like a different person. Giovanni, come here, It's Gino. Gino? You're a man! But how did you get back? They released me from the prison camp, because I agreed to cooperate. What do you mean? He joined the Allies. To at least try to save face. The war is almost over, and we lost. Everyone loses in war, even the ones who win. Rosetta, do you want to go for ice cream? Sure. Go, Rosetta. Tonight you come to ours for dinner, we'll all be together. - A nice couple. Don't you think? - Yes, they look good together.
