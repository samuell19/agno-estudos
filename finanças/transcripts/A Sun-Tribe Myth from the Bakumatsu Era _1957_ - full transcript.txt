ANikkatsu Production Celebrating the Third Anniversary of Resuming Film Production SHINAGAWA REST STOP Are you all right? Halt! Stay back! It's dangerous! In times of upheaval, eh? BAKUMATSU TAI-YODEN After a Tokaido Line train departs Shinagawa, itgoes under the Yatsuyama Overpass. Running over this overpass is Japan 's busiest highway, Ieading to the Keihin Industrial area. Off to the side of the highway is a narrow alley. This was the first stop of 53 rest stops in samurai times. It was the Shinagawa Rest Stop. This once-popular stop is now a nondescript alley, except for its sixteen "'specially licensed cafes "', employing ninety-one hostesses of an average age of thirty-four. In one year's time, the red-light business will cease to exist, due to the new anti-prostitution law. The 350-year history ofShinagawa 's pleasure district is about to end. But that's not what this movie is about. It's not about modern Shinagawa or changes to prostitution. It's set in the second year of the Bunkyu Era. The year is 1862, six years before the fall of the Shogun. Business was slow in Shinagawa, one of Tokyo 's major red-light areas. But as it was the first stop of a major route, there were still 100 brothels and 1, 000 hostesses competing with each other for clients. SAGAM I HOTEL, TH E ONCE FAM OUS SAGAM I INN Directed by KAWASHIMA Yuzo THE SAGAM I INN Such times of upheaval, eh? - Welcome, sirs! - This way, gentlemen, thank you. We get a thank-you before we pay. Only brothel workers are so grateful. Listen, this is our first time and I'm footing the bill! Just make sure we get four of your very best girls. As you wish, sir. And we want some cheerful geisha too! No gloomy ones, you understand? Certainly, sir. This way, please. Just look at that decor! Shinagawa's so classy. And a sea breeze too. It's blowing a bit too much tonight. We'll go for quantity and quality when it comes to drinks. I know I needn't worry, but we don't want to leave with headaches. You won't, sirs. And serve us a variety of delicious dishes, will you? We don't like small servings on big plates. And one more thing! Oh, forget it. Aren't you being a little extravagant, brother? Don't worry, leave it to me. You only have 1 bu or so... Give me your share now. Just make sure you wake before dawn and get out of here. - Why's that? - I have a plan. I have nothing to do at home that early... You idiot! You can go home and sleep some more. - Oh, that was quick! - Sorry to keep you waiting. Let me introduce the girls to you. From your left, Osome, Otetsu, Oyoshi and Oume... And may we offer... Enough formality! Let's go to the banquet room. Sophistication isn't our thing at all. Let's go! Time is money and it's ticking away! Oh, Monta-san, you look so tense. - Stay out of it, woman! - Oh, well. - Where's Takasugi? - In my room. She's always busy, that one. We're coming in! What happened to your hand, Monta? So it was you, having fun with the foreigners earlier. We weren't playing around! We punished them for their misbehaviour. And they escaped? They were on horses! And then the officials showed up... They're engineers building the Foreigners' Quarter, Takasugi. What? Engineers for the building? That's what they told us. So you understand English that well? I'm not sure about Monta's English, but the foreigners ran off to Gotenyama. Oi! Sake! Bring sake! - Yamato, keep your voice down. - Why's that? I've been here for days without paying. I get dirty looks from the maids. Don't worry, I gave them some money tonight. Only 3 ryo? That's it? 3 ryo out of 63? Those penniless samurai think this is some kind of charity. I'll get them to pay before the end of the month. It's ridiculous. They go on about politics and expelling the foreigners, but none of them has the money to pay! Tokusaburo still isn't back? No. I don't know where the young master goes so often. You're not secretly giving him spending money? No, I swear. - Ohisa, be sparing with the rice! - Sorry, ma'am. They eat as much as you serve. Keep the fire low. The fire god will punish you. What's wrong, Officer? - I've caught a cold. - Too bad. Are the samurai who attacked the foreigners here? I'll take a look. Here you are, Boss. Hello, Officer. Kisuke, show the officer in. Watch yourself around those Nationalists. Don't worry, I was born and bred in Shinagawa, I'm a local. With that face of yours? Hello, Officer. Look at you, all dressed up. Me with a cold and you with an eye infection. - No customers? - Come on in! A prostitute with a kid? You'd make my cold worse. So, Koharu and Osome are vying for top billing as usual. Koharu! Tell your patrons that a police officer's here. Very well. By the way, how many patrons has Osome had tonight? Just one so far, a first-timer. Your position's safe. Oh, I'm so busy! Osome. - Listen... - How many has Koharu had so far? Not many yet. You'll be number one again next month. I don't know. Osome... Can't you pay me some of the interest you owe me? I had to send money home and you know it. I know that, but... Tomorrow's the Fire God Festival. My folks can't even afford to pay tax. Stuff those in the countryside! What about us? That's why I'm asking my regulars for favours. - Maybe tomorrow... - I won't hold my breath. You got yourself in this mess by being too choosy. Just look at Koharu, eh? I know! Stop talking about Koharu! That's why I took on that nobody with the huge forehead. Excuse me. An inspection. Eh, what? You want us to have an extension? Uh, no... Er... I mean an inspection. Extension, yes, please! Leave them be. Hey, pal, we're low on drinks. Bring them on! Listen, brother... What about the payment? Forget it! You look so worried, you're putting me off my drink! '"A man shows strength, a woman shows charm!'" Officer, this way. An inspection! I'd kill all the crows In the whole wide world So I can sleep in with... Thank you, Officer. Monta-san! It's humiliating, having to hide from a small-time police officer. '"Both time and my horse betray me.'" Hey, pour me one. Let down by your horse and by time! Excuse me, gentlemen. Onto the next patron? That's harsh! Well, I wouldn't make any money if I stayed here. Enjoy yourselves. - Hey, tell our girls to come! - Very well. We still owe them 60 ryo. And you didn't get those rogue foreigners. Monta, where's my watch? Ah, the watch... You haven't pawned it yet? Have you lost it? No. I must have left it at the manor as we sneaked out. Kijima, the Old Devil, got me jumpy. - Will Kijima give us money? - He has no mercy. He complained about our aborted attack at the British Consulate. INDEPENDENCE FOR JAPAN TAKASUGI - We'll set it on fire. - On fire? The Foreigners' Quarter. It'll make up for our failure. We'll shock the blue-eyed bastards and the Shogunate. I'm in! How about you, Yamato and Ito? We're in. It's you, Kusaka. You startled us. Anybody could hear you in the corridor. You've been grounded, yet you sneak out to a brothel? Behave yourselves! Calm down. You're beginning to sound like Old Kijima. What's so funny? I'm going for a piss. - Me too. I've been holding it. - Same here. Let's have a gang piss together. A-ha! You're that samurai I saw earlier. - You dropped something precious. - Precious? - A foreign watch. - What? I have it in my room now. - Where is it? - Upstairs. Excuse me. So I dropped it? Really? Monta, this is a serious blunder. - I bet I left it... - Don't play innocent. It's not just any watch, I bought it in Shanghai. I know! We all know you've been to Shanghai. It's only a watch. - How about that? - Very nice. - Be careful... - Don't worry. Don't touch it! You'll break it! You think so? You're the one who dropped and broke it. Give it back! Don't be so rough. I took time to repair it. You want money for repairing it? Well... I bet the authorities would reward me. Is that how you talk to a samurai? Hold it! Monta, you're in the wrong. Leave! - But this man... - Leave! Apologies. He's got a lot on his mind right now. Forgive him. Really? You mean, he's lost it? - Oh, Monta, watch your step. - Shut up! - Excuse me, sir. - Just a minute... Come on in! - I've brought your bill. - So you have. Your face looks too exotic for a Japanese. Women must love you. Sir, I was born and bred here in Shinagawa... Don't get me wrong, I wasn't prying. What do I owe you? - Take a look, please. - Oh, is this all? We had a ball and you only charge us this much? I'm sorry, but I don't have this much on me. - I'll talk to your friends then. - No, you can't do that! Don't embarrass my friends in front of the ladies. You'll have it tomorrow morning. How about now, sir? It's our policy... - Don't be uncouth now! - Did I keep you? No, you're just in time. Don't make a scene, unless that's how you like it. Not at all, sir. I'll take care of it in the morning, don't you worry. I see. I'm counting on you, sir. Close the door behind you to keep out the breeze. And fetch me another robe, will you? I sweat in my sleep. Certainly, sir. He's awfully friendly, that fellow. He sides with the Nationalists. Now, let's take this off. Hold your horses! I won't be doing it tonight. - What? - I won't be having any. What nonsense! Right... I mean it. I won't be needing your services. What did you say? Are you trying to embarrass me? Of course not. I've got chest pains, so I'm here to recuperate. Very funny! Now don't make me angry. I don't mean to humiliate you, but it's life or death for me. Stop that! You idiot. You don't make a fool out of Osome! I'm turning you down, you imbecile! That's fine with me. If you have patrons waiting, go ahead. Ain't Shinagawa the best place for chest pains? Great food, nice sea breeze. And on a fine day, you get a nice view of the hills in Chiba. Hail to the Lord Buddha... Hail to the Lord Buddha, Hail to the Lord Buddha... Put those bastards in their place. Soon enough! - Many thanks. - Thank you, sirs. Hello, Chobei. - Father? - Is the master in? - Is my brother well? - Hmm. Are you still working on the Foreigners' Quarter? - Yes, I'm starting today. - No time to dawdle then, Father. Yes. Where's my toolbox? Over there. - You have the money? - It's my tools I'm after. Good morning. Hey, Chobei! You just waltz in and take the tools you pawned to us? What good is a carpenter with no tools? Shame on you! Get out! - Now I've got this... - Hold on! So I can put your daughter to work? I might be dirt poor, but I'm not selling my daughter to a brothel! Is that so? Well, come back with my money then. Watch it, you fool! What a rude fellow. The Fire God Festival's tomorrow so I'll be back. I'll be waiting for you. Take care, sir. Sorry to have kept you waiting. - Oh? Leaving so soon? - Yes. Listen, come back soon, won't you? You're the only man I can depend on. I know that. You can miss me, but don't cry. I won't see you off because it will make me miss you so. I'd kill all the crows In the whole wide world... Sorry I made you wait. It's fine, I know you're popular. Ouch! Tomorrow's the Fire God Festival. Please drop by. Master Kurazo, you're the only man I can depend on. Very well, I'll come. You'll miss me, but don't be sad. I won't see you off. I'd miss you too much if I did. So I can sleep in with my man... Sorry I'm late. Oh? You're still sleeping? Your eyelids will be glued shut! Oh, wrong room. Sorry! - Excuse me, sir. - What is it? I've taken over Kisuke's shift. - Did my pals leave? - Before dawn. All right. Can you heat some sake for me? Eh? Right away, sir. On that subject, your bill, sir... You don't have to tell me, I know. In you, I see a playboy who's paying off his debt as a servant. - I can tell. - Well... By the time I have my drink, take a bath and a nap, it'll be evening. Then three men will join me for some fun. And who are they? Well... I'll let you in on it. They're my pals! I see. Then I'll give them a good time and we'll depart, all paid up! Eh? A man like you surely knows how it works. Certainly, I'm with you, sir. Now I've impressed you, go and fetch the sake. Make it dry sake. I've got a sweet aftertaste after so much. Tokusaburo! Hi, Father. Long time, Mother. Where've you been hanging about? Doing some business research. Around the Yoshiwara again? Yoshiwara is a damn fine place. As I meet the girl again and again... Idiot! - Boss! Zenpachi! - Yes, sir! Can you deal with the bill? - I have a horse waiting outside. - A horse! The man from Yoshiwara, come in! - Thank you. - Someone give the man some tea! Don't waste it. If he's a horse, give him tea leaves. How witty! Pay him for me, please. - No, it never stops! - Go on, please. No way! Right, I'll pay him myself! Tokusaburo! - Stop going to brothels! - Cut it out! If brothels are that bad, we'd better inform them. - Stop going to brothels! - Shame on you! - Hail to the Lord Buddha... - Stop going to brothels... Stop it, you fool! I'll disown you! Your father was good to me when he was alive. But I'm your stepfather now and I deserve respect! He's right. We're your parents. I won't let you treat my husband like this. It's an embarrassment to our ancestors. Lord Buddha, have mercy! - Can you pass me that? - The calendar? So, what's a good day to disown your son? How about tomorrow? Not on the Fire God's holy day! The day after's unlucky... - The day after that? - Bad for funerals. Show me. This is next year's calendar. This isn't funny! I can't handle your son anymore. You deal with him. Zenpachi! - Where's my tea and rice? - Coming. Look at your hands, chapped from the cold. It's an outrage. My folks took you as collateral. They must be devils... - Tokusaburo! - Watch out for yourself. You've just started to bud, ready for business. Ohisa, get back in there! Good morning. It's unusual to find you here, sir. Hello, Kinzo. Any interesting books? I have one that shows the private parts of foreigners. That sounds good. Show me! Show me! Morning. - Good morning, ladies. - Ah, the man from Echigo's. - Shall I show you to your room? - Here's fine. - I'll get some hot water. - Me too. Well, seeing as it's a holy day tomorrow, those creeps are hoping we'll give them tips. Ladies, how about this for next spring? Oh, that's beautiful. Show me! - I'm not finished. - Later! - What a divine pattern. - Take a look at this. - How about this? - It's lovely... Osome, you should come and have a look. - I'll pass. - I'll treat you to one if you want. Well, well, Koharu. That's very kind of you, but mind your own business. Don't be so tetchy, I was merely making conversation. Watch it, I won't put up with your attitude! - What's that? - Oh, nothing. You were still wearing an apron only yesterday. That's none of your business. You're so unpopular, all you do is make tea! I dare you to say that again! Of course I will. I said, '"You spend all your time making tea.'" What? At least I don't sleep with just anyone like you, you whore! That's an unholy ruckus outside. I'd kill all the crows... Hey, can I ask you to stop? How come, sir? I'd kill all the crows in the whole wide world So I can sleep in with my man - Great lyrics, don't you think? - I wrote that song. It's embarrassing to hear another man sing it. So you wrote it? Isn't that something? Osome, you caused a scene? You're mature enough to know better. Maybe. Anybody replied to your letters? Everyone expects tips tomorrow. I want to be more generous than Koharu. You are in a spot, aren't you? Show me the client book. - The owner of the Hoshino Inn? - I wrote to him first. - How about the monk Bonzen? - Oh, please! I'd rather die. This one's no good either... If I died alone, people would think I'd killed myself because of my debts. This is hopeless. I wonder if a love suicide would be the best... - A love suicide? - But who'd be a good partner? Yasuke... He's no good. Isn't there anybody I could die with? There's Kinzo the book dealer from Kanda. He's downstairs now, but you couldn't call him wealthy. Even though his name means '"Gold-maker'". What a joke! Kinzo... Well, he has no family. He's vulgar and absent-minded... He could die. - What's that you're muttering? - Just talking to myself. You said Kinzo was downstairs? I've got Love Suicide in Osaka. And Love Suicide in Amijima, The Courier in the Netherworld, and the famous Love Suicide in Sonezaki... - How morbid, Kinzo. - They're all Love Suicides. Don't say that, they're engrossing. Look at that! It's pretty racy. How about Love Suicide in Shinagawa? You must be kidding! Kinzo! - Yes, Madam Okuma? - Osome wants to see you. Me? Osome wants to see me? Kinzo, darling, you've come. You make me so happy. You promised you'd come, but I wondered if you'd got cold feet. Of course not. Good. I'll do the rounds and come back. Order anything you please. And don't be stingy, darling. Bring me sake! Ohisa, lend me some money, would you? Not a chance. I would have years ago, but not now. Years ago? When you were a pupil at Jogyo Temple school. You were clever and kind... but you've changed. Oh, please! But I'm telling you, watch out for yourself. My parents are as merciless as demons. Whoring in Shinagawa would be hell, with my demon of a mother telling you what to do. That demon mother is really... Son! Hey, Kinzo, wake up. Come on, Kinzo! Is it sunrise? What are you muttering about? We're going to commit love suicide. Oh, that's right. After a nap, I can't be bothered... Can't we put it off? Nobody puts these things off. Get ready. - Come on. - I'm getting ready. I'm cold. - Unwrap this. - What's in it? - I sold everything I own to buy it. - Oh... Oh, I'm so happy, Kinzo, darling! I'll wear this. How come the bottom half is missing? I didn't have enough money. When I rot, it's all the same. That's right. - Where's the blade? - I forgot it! Oh, you're such an imbecile! I had a pair of razors sharpened just in case. Razors? No, razors are very dangerous! What do you mean? Cuts made with thin blades don't heal easily. What are you talking about? You're telling me that you won't die with me? You deceived me! I didn't mean that... I'll go by myself then. In three days, my ghost will curse you to death! - Stop, it's dangerous! - Let me go! You could hurt yourself! Where do you think you're going? - It's a long pier. - And life is short. - Move forward. - Don't push me, please. - What now? - We jump in. - Into the sea? - Yes. No, I can't! I can't swim, you see. What's wrong with you? - I have a cold. Stir it well. - It's not a bath! - Osome! - Before somebody comes. I might cut myself on broken bowls or something. - I want to go in slowly. - Osome! I'll follow you, go ahead. Osome! - You mustn't do it! - Let me go, I have to die. You have money. Monk Bonzen has arrived. - Really? But I'm in trouble now. - What is it? I just pushed a man into the sea. - Who is it? - Kinzo. Acne-faced Kinzo? Don't worry then. Nobody else knows about it. Go and change. Kinzo darling, I'm putting this off. My regards to everyone. Don't feel bad about it! Hurry up! I do feel bad about it! It's shallow. Damn that woman! She pushed me off and left! Damn you! FIRE GOD SHRINE - Thanks for the tip, ma'am. - Not at all. You borrowed from me to tip him. Pay me back. I forgot about Osome! Osome. Ah, Kinzo! Pull yourself together. It's me. It's just you. Sorry, but I'm taking some of your things. This as well. It won't even cover the interest, but anything ofvalue... Nothing's worth very much. And this is from me. Take care of yourself. I'd be up and about, if it wasn't for you. Don't blame me. I just said the monk came... Don't remind me of that monk! I think I'll take this too. I'd rather have died with Kinzo than have this cold. I'd have made the news... '"Osome and Kinzo, A Love Suicide at Shinagawa'". Oh, Kinzo, I hope you'll forgive me. They said no? It's fine with me, but not with the management. They don't understand anything, do they? I'm waiting for my friends to settle the bill, right? Roll up the moxa for me. When are those friends of yours coming anyway? When I'm done with the moxa, right? - Try another. - Here... Attach it. It's best when you're overworked. You rolled it so sloppily! Ouch! Sorry. Light another one, will you? No more playing with me, sir. You've got to help me out here. I beg you. Well, then, I'll settle this fair and square. Oh, thank you, sir! Here's the punchline. I don't have a single penny on me! Isn't that hilarious? I'll visit those friends of yours... Also, what's even funnier is that I don't know where any of them live! What am I going to do about this? There's nothing you can do. But sir? Just go with the flow. Ouch! Ouch! I'm getting rid of him. - I'll sell him to the Kagema Teahouse. - Not Kagema! Anything but that, ma'am. As a man, I just couldn't do what the girls here do. Kisuke, you're the son of a wandering whore. I took you in and gave you a decent life. He owes you, but it's not all his fault. Those two and I, the manager... You two wouldn't get any patrons. - Kisuke's no youngster, but... - Please, have mercy on me. Kisuke's learned his lesson. Very well. You'll receive half your salary. - Kisuke and Kaneji get nothing. - But... Now get out of here. Go on, out! Make that grifter work hard to cover his expenses. Yes? What do you want? I'm Saheiji the Grifter. For a start, I can help you count money. What? First, I have to work out how much damage you did us. I've already worked out how many days of service I owe you. What? Oh, my back... You've got arthritis? That's bad. Massage works for arthritis. Allow me. It's the elbow-shoulder-back meridian. There you go. Altogether, that'll be 500 mon. 500? No, thank you. Perfect timing. My shoulder's hurting as well. The Sugiyama style or Yoshida style? No! You're driving me to tears! Looks like I'd better go and stay in my little room. Hey, boss, can you show me the way? Mr Grifter, sir. I know, this one over here. Oh, what a lovely room! The cobwebs are a nice touch. I have more bedding than I need, and tobacco too. I could hole up for weeks in here. Drop by when you have nothing better to do. Messengers approaching! Something's shaking up the Shogun and his idiotic lackeys. Maybe it's our friends in Kyoto? You mean they've got ahead of us? Is that man in the hood old man Kijima? Yes, it's the Old Devil. Kijima! Are you back from Yokohama? - Yes. - Back from our English lessons. And you, sir? I'm on my way to the Fire God shrine. That's very commendable, sir. - It looks like rain's on its way. - Don't be ridiculous. Don't do what I wouldn't do, men. Excuse me. He's off to the shrine unaccompanied? I doubt it. - Maybe he has a lady friend. - Interesting... We could blackmail him for 100 ryo! - Which room is it? - Banquet, number 11. Give it here! Thank you for waiting, gentlemen in number 11! Thank you. Thank you. Here you are! Why is he serving tables? Welcome! You? If I'd known this would happen, I'd have pawned the watch sooner. You'd only get 20 ryo for it. - Excuse me, gentlemen. - It's you! You'll see me working around here. I'd kill all the crows... I'll get you more charcoal. It's completely in bits! Keep your hands off! Hold it! This is what the British call the '"anchor'". It hooks onto this cogwheel. - This is no job for clumsy amateurs. - What! I'll expect a nice fee for repairs. Anyway, kick those samurai out of here. We can't afford an idle room. Accompany them to their manor and get what they owe us. I'll act as the '"horse'" then? More like a donkey! But you'll collect the debt. - A donkey? - An ass, get it? With that no-good grifter swindling us, just the thought of him makes me angry! Sorry to interrupt. - Why are you here? - Why are you wandering around? I got this as part of Mr Takasugi's payment. - What's this? - A watch. I can see that! It's a new product from Switzerland. What's it worth? At least 60 ryo, but collectors would pay 200 ryo for it. That's right, isn't it, Boss? I'm impressed. Zenpachi, you can learn a little from... Mr Grifter. - A little something for you. - Dearest! You deserve a holy day tip, but you owe us. So let's pretend. I'll just pretend I got tipped. Thank you. Room 12, your food is ready! That drunk won't keep his hands off me. Could I ask you to humour him? I hope you'll tip me, though. Where are you, Koharu? Excuse me... Forgive me, Seishichi. Everything's crazy tonight. Take a bath while I show my face to a few more fellows. Come on! Don't look so angry. Once we get married, you won't have to worry. Right? Hello, master. I'm so sorry, things are crazy tonight. I was just going for a pee... When we become man and wife, I'll be all yours. Until then, we'll persevere. Do your rounds, take your time. I have to go and pee. - Father! - Seishichi? Hey, where...? Praise the Lord Buddha... Spending money while your mother's crying in her grave! So what? I'm not having an affair. I'm too old to be a sugar daddy. But there's one trustworthy woman who I'll marry... That's what all the patrons want to believe, Father! - You think you're special? - Seishichi! If you know how it works here, then please go home. I'll let bygones be bygones. Father, you're just being selfish. Let me show you what I got from my woman. I'm not going anywhere! It's a letter confirming your engagement. Look at this, Koharu promises here to marry me. That's very sweet of her. Governor, are you from Choshu Province? Yes. And nobody messes with me, the Old Devil. Puffer fish are too watery in the capital. In my home province of Choshu, everything is better! Of course. I hope I won't see any of my countrymen here. You needn't worry. We have samurai from Satsuma, your mortal enemies. Really? Where's Koharu? Bring her to me. I didn't tip you for nothing! This is for hearing you out. One more thing! Nothing. Go! - He'll doze off in a minute. - Thank you. Sorry I took so long. Oh, he's still in the bath. Sorry I took so long. Oh? You look like King Yama in Hell. Koharu, sit there. What's this all about, Master? You can have this back. I never went anywhere without this. You promised to marry me. You've had a change of heart! How could you? Give it a rest! You've embarrassed me. Explain this to me. Seishichi is my son, doing his apprenticeship. How could you promise to marry both of us? How awful of me! He nagged me to write it so I did, but it's invalid. I don't want to call your son names, but he's still such a baby. Come out, '"baby'"! Koharu, why you! Help, help! Somebody stop them! - Somebody! - What is it? Two men are fighting over the engagement letters Koharu wrote. Wait! I know how to handle this. I need my jacket. Get me some paper and something to write with. I'm a prostitute, so I'll be damned in hell. Deception is my business. What? When you break a marriage promise, three of the gods' messenger crows die! I couldn't care less if they all died! You hate crows that much? No, but I want them dead so I can sleep in. - What? - Get off me! This body of mine is owned by the Inn, from head to toe. Do what you like with it, but only if you pay! You beast, you scratched me! Just hold it right there! Who are you? Koharu! How dare you trick me? Not just me, but all three of us, with this fraudulent letter! You too! Let me kill her! Don't stop me! Don't stop me! Let me go! You don't understand. What's wrong, sir? There's a long and sad story behind this engagement letter. A tale I can't tell without tears. But I'll tell it to you. ...and my business ended up failing. That's how low I've sunk! I know it's tough. Don't despair and work hard. Yes, sir. This has been a good lesson for us all. You're still young, so let's leave all this behind us and head back to the capital. Thank you, sir, but I'm so emotional I can't move. I see. This is not much but take it. No, sir... Keep working and things will look up. Thank you so much. Please excuse me. This is what the explosive looks like. Attach the igniting cord. The exact compound ratio isn't in the chemistry book. We'll experiment and work it out by trial and error. You can't just do it anywhere. I owe you. - Here, I want you to have this. - No, you keep it. Oh? What's wrong, my sweet Grifter? I'd rather you bought these letters for 1 ryo a piece. - But these are... - I can call those men back. Oh, you're sneaky! Right, then, I'll be off. I'll buy all three of them for 3 ryo. Let me go and get the money. That's better. - Want some? - It stinks. Is it medicine? It warms you up. - Nobody's ever treated me like this. - Oh, really? I'm quite impressed. I've met all kinds of people, but you top them all. Listen, marry me when my contract's up. - I'm afraid not. - Why not? '"I'm a prostitute, deception is my business!'" Chilly, isn't it? They're executing one of the wanted bandits. What bad luck! That means nobody will come today. - Shall we call in the grifter? - No, he's busy. Besides, he'll charge us by the minute. He's so clever, he knows algebra and even square roots! - What's that? - Some kind of maths. And he's a trained calligrapher too. Maybe he's really a ninja! Hello. Mixing medicine again, are you? That is some contraption you've got there. I use iris florentina and coreopsis, both tropical herbs. Can you write ten more engagement letters to these men? I'll give you a discount, 200 mon a letter. But you don't handwrite them, you print them! That's in order to keep up with popular demand. I get orders from Shinagawa, Shinjuku, Yoshiwara and the other rest stops. If you don't like it, write them yourself. That's typical of you, Grifter. I like you even more. It's not just our dignity, the man's taking all the jobs with tips. In his free time, he's making money printing letters. We have to take action if we're going to survive. Either he leaves or we'll have to move out. That's right. Supper's ready! Let's talk to him after supper. He won't listen to our words, but he'll listen to my fist. What's that you're eating? You must have money to spare. I have more brains than money to spare. What's that? I was strolling down the hall and found some leftover chicken. I cooked it with seaweed and ginger. Try it. I'll sell you some. I'll show you my fist! We want to have a chat with you after supper. Very well, I'll join you. Osome! What are you all jumpy about? He's here. Kinzo is here! The acne-faced Kinzo? What are you on about? He's dead. He really is here! I put him in room 6. He looks weak and white as a sheet... Maybe... it's his ghost! In the daytime? No way. He's such an imbecile, he can't tell night from day! Legs? Does he have any legs? I didn't look. You have to go and greet him. No, I don't want to. Take this off. Come on! - Over here. - Okuma! - Come with me. - No, I won't! Hail to the Lord Buddha... Oh, Kinzo, it really is you! Merciful Buddha, protect me... I thought that was the end of you. I chanted scriptures every day. Don't just stand there. Sit here next to me. Oh, my, Kinzo! If you're alive, why didn't you come sooner? Osome... To tell the truth... ... I died. Oh, I don't like this! I died once and have come back. Oh, stop messing about! I've come back to life. I'm ready to go. What are you on about? Anyway, thank goodness you're alive. I've got so much to tell you about. I'll order some dishes for you to enjoy. I'm feeling a little unwell. I'm just going to have a lie down. Very well. I'll get some food, you stay right there. Well, then? What a joke! He's not a ghost. Order some food. And don't forget sake. Hurry! '"The man commonly known as Kinzo departed this world aged 30...'" We're here for some fun! Anybody home? Take the lid off and show them the floater! Please wait! Guests will be put off from entering our establishment... Shut up! Shut up! I bet you lot will recognise this body! - It's Kinzo! - That's right. Some whore named Osome tricked poor Kinzo into dying! Osome! How are you going to make up for this, then? I'm awfully sorry for any grief we've caused. I hope you'll accept my apologies. - Please accept this for your trouble... - Hold your horses! Ouch, that's hot! Kinzo, this trick's too old to work in Shinagawa. - It was a bad idea, brother! - Shut it! So who the devil are you? Catch me if you can. Damn him! Wait! Leave this to the grifter. Everybody, back to your rooms. And don't come back! Oh, that makes sense! My apologies. I didn't know who you were. It happens all the time. Remember who to talk to. Come under the roof. You don't want to go away empty-handed. We'll share this. This is for you. And this is for you. And for you, Kinzo. This covers the coffin. And this is my share. There's a bad cold going around, take care. Thanks. Take care of yourself, boss! - Don't waste this. - How did it go? Nothing to worry about, a bunch of chickens. By the way, didn't you want a word with me after supper? Oh... it's nothing. We just wanted to ask you about that... Oh, I see. Count me in. Kisuke, can you pile this wood out the back? I earned it. I'll make chopsticks out of it and sell them. - Chopsticks out of a coffin? - Oh, yes! Do that for me. He doesn't know when to stop. Grifter, my dear, you were amazing. Were you hurt? Thank you, you really saved me. Oh, it was nothing. It's not much, but I'd like you to have this. How kind of you. I'll get more from my regulars in a few days, and so will you. Oh, you're still unwell? I'm almost better. So, are you still upset about the other day? When I called you a fool? - That didn't bother me. - Really? That's good! My dear Grifter, I'll need to call on you from time to time. - Now then... - See you soon. You can have this back now. And here's 40 ryo, after withholding your debt. If you'd agreed sooner, you'd have saved yourself some trouble! Your daughter will be well off now. Right, put your seal on this deal. Here you go. Right here. I hope you'll be good to my daughter... Hey! You're selling your daughter to these devils? - Son, stay out of this! - No, it's not right. Toku, dear! This is heinous. Does Ohisa know about this? Be quiet. - I bet you lost at dice. - No, it was a card game. It's the same thing! It's all ridiculous. Listen... - Toku! - Leave us alone! I won't move until he hears me out and sees reason. - It's about morals... - Very well, take this and go! Is that all? This won't do. Listen to me carefully. He thinks he can bargain with us. Here! - Keep them coming. - You ingrate! - Thank you. - Leave that alone! And you, stay away from gambling. And play... - Having a good time? - Come and join us. I certainly will! - I made tea for you, Father. - No, thanks. Work hard now. - Have some tea. - Don't worry. I'm too busy. Father! Give this to my little brother. What will you do after the Foreigners' Quarter is built? I'll get by. Buy a kite and a spinning top for him. I probably won't be home until New Year's Day. Go back inside. I'll drop by again. How could Father forget his precious tools? Ohisa, just come here a moment. Right! Grifter, I'll bet everything and my kimono. - Are you sure? - You're damn right! I'll turn this game around. Saheiji... Iet me borrow that penny, won't you? Are you kidding? I'll win and quadruple it so I can free Ohisa! - But you don't even love her. - I feel sorry for her. It's the same. - That can't be true coming from you! - So, you won't help me? Sorry, but no. Right, then, I'll borrow the kimono and go and make some money. - What about payment? - It's on the tab! Young master... You have a plan? Shall I tell you mine? Really? - Welcome home, Father. - Where are you off to? On an errand. I knew you were up to no good. Somebody, help! This is awful! Father's lost his mind! Lock him up in the storehouse! Quick! You half-wit brat! Let me go, you idiots! Saheiji, help me! Pick him up! - Damn you! - Keep it down. Grifter, I trusted you, as one man to another! I know I talk nonsense, but I trusted you! And that's how you got yourself into all this bother. If you go round trusting everyone in this world, you'll end up in an even worse mess. Damn you! THE SAGAMI INN It's freezing! I brought you some food. Ohisa, a couple of days in here and I'll die! - Young master... - What? - Take me as your wife. - What the...? I have to work as a prostitute. I'd rather be your wife. You'd rather...? I thought about running off alone, but that would put Father in trouble. If you married me, my father's debt would be cancelled. Who put such a bold idea in your head? It's my own idea. Father's never going to make 50 ryo in his life. We sleep in a house that's colder than this... I don't want to be a prostitute though. Marry me, please. What a day of surprises it's been. I'll have to think about it. Elope with me. Just until things settle down. I would if I could escape here. I'll ask the grifter. He'll get you out. You're joking! He won't do anything unless he's paid. What's that? Our test explosions were successful. We'll do it tomorrow night. Have you got the plans to the Foreigners' Quarter? Not yet. They've deployed more security. We need to know the way in. Ready or not, tomorrow's the night. Good day to you, Captain. Still got a cold? Take care of yourself. Those Nationalists are up to no good. Security around the Foreigners' Quarter is tight. It's because the Christians think the 13th is an unlucky day... Friday the 13th, or something. - I absolutely oppose the plan. - What? Burn down the Foreigners' Quarter? We're not gangsters. Don't call us gangsters. We don't need you! - Decide by rock-paper-scissors. - What? If you lose, you come with us. You fool! We're revolutionaries. This isn't child's play! Stop agitating your fellow samurai! It's not about burning the place down, it's a protest against the humiliating treaty with America. The foreigners can see the strongholds we built to keep them out. Listen, Kusaka, I saw how the Westerners violated Shanghai. Japan will be just like Shanghai if we don't stop the Shogunate. Burning down the Foreigners' Quarter won't do! You just complain! Do you have a better idea? Our solution is proactive. Look at the bigger picture. - You just think and do nothing! - Use your brain! - Damn it! - Come on! Are we fighting amongst ourselves now? Decide by rock-paper-scissors. You could elope with him, but you'd need support. His uncle in Senju has a big house and no children, and he adores the young master. If you helped us, Grifter, you'd get 10 ryo. 10 ryo? But I couldn't give it to you now. I'd save 1 ryo every year. - So, in 10 years' time... - 10 years? Japan will be a different country in 10 years' time! If Japan changes, I will too. It might change for the better. Very good. I like the way you think. We're in big trouble. Yamato pissed on a police post and was arrested. Pissed on a police post? - Why? - We begged for his release. - What about the explosives? - Yamato has five of them on him. - Five? - Right. What the hell was he thinking, pissing there? Right, we'll have to do it even if we're not all here. Kenji! Like the saying goes: '"A wise man changes, a fool never.'" - Let's go! - Wait... We can't evade security without the plans. - But it's now or never. - Wait! Let me think about it. Takasugi, are you backing down? Excuse me, gents, I'm here to remove the cinders. You again? Sorry, sirs, but can you move to the next room? Cold today, eh? Oh, I notice someone's been taking the charcoal. - Hey, leave that charcoal! - It's for the next room... - Stop! - Put it back! Why are you acting so strangely over a bit of charcoal? - Put it down! - Very well... See to Mr Takasugi's room, will you? - He knows. - He must know about our plan. - No way. - He's been snooping around. But he doesn't look like a spy. The Shogun's spies are everywhere. - I'll kill him. - Wait! I'll do it. - Why not me? - You're unreliable. I'll do it. How is it, ladies? Oh, it's perfect. It's wonderful, my dear Grifter! - Isn't it a bit hot? - Oh, shut up. Feels lovely! It's just like being in a hot spring resort. It's heaven! I've never had a bath so good, my dear Grifter. Maybe you'd like me to scrub your backs, ladies? - Oh, yes, please! - Me too. Grifter, Takasugi wants to see you. I'll be back. This is the best. Oh, it's heaven! It's too hot! - I'll kill you! - That's no way to behave. You can burn down the Foreigners' Quarter, for all I care. If you know that much, you'll have to die. Eh, is that a samurai's logic? '"When things look bad, just draw your swords and kill'"? Your political activism is funded by us peasants, but ordinary people like us have to survive on our wits. What? I know I'll make it even if I lose my head! Well said. If I pull this out, you'll sink with the boat. So, go ahead and kill me if you wish! I lose. - I never trust samurai. - Wait! I don't want to die with you in the Shinagawa Sea. I don't want to catch a cold in the winter sea either. - But I'm not a bad swimmer. - Hey, stop! I apologise. - You're the mistrustful one. - You doubted me first. There's no need to threaten me. I've never doubted you. But I had to test you. Can you help us with our scheme? - Nothing comes for free. - You'll be paid. Let me work on that Old Devil Kijima. What is it? I'm busy. Excuse me! Oh, my! You again... Koharu! Have you been waiting for me anxiously? - Well, I... - I've had a lot to deal with lately. I wanted to visit you but I had to resist. Koharu, you've waited such a long time. Don't say anything. I understand everything perfectly. Your long wait is finally over. - What's going on? - Come here. All set, sir. Mr Grifter? - How's your sweetheart? - Fine. Are we all set for tonight? Oh, yes. You have the tools your father left? So you have things like saws and chisels? Koharu, wait! So long, Master Kijima. Monta! Is this one of your pranks? There's no time for explanations. I only beg for your mercy. As I've been pleading with you for weeks, I hope you'll lend me 100 ryo. Idiot! You think I go around carrying such a large sum? I don't wish to be rude, sir, but I've come to learn of your liaison with Koharu. You villain! Shame on you! We have a rogue samurai like you in our domain? In all my 52 years... The shame of it! - Yamato, are you all right? - We got him released. - And the explosives? - Were they confiscated? You must commit hara-kiri in recompense! No, he ate the explosives. So that they wouldn't find them. How did they taste? Bad, like eating sand. - Yamato... - How did it go with the Old Devil? Success! I put tears in the Devil's eyes. That's how you deal with samurai. I wish I could keep you here forever. - A small token of gratitude. - Thank you, thank you. Master, I don't want to worry you, but I heard strange noises when I walked past the storehouse. Maybe your son's trying to escape? Damn you, woman! You're helping him to escape! - The keys, Master. - Lock this woman up with my son! Mr Grifter! Son, Ohisa. You won't eat or drink until you learn your lesson! Mr Grifter, keep your eye on the both of them. Certainly. We'll guard them in shifts. Good. I appreciate it. Rest assured, sir. Leave this to me, chaps. Grifter, you backstabber! Chobei. I knew you'd come back for this sooner or later. Don't worry. You can do me a favour concerning Ohisa. Ohisa? I can't look her in the eye. If you helped me with my scheme, you'd be freeing her. Come on. It's eleven o'clock. It's time. - Let's set off. - No. Let's not rush it. We've waited long enough. Forget the plans. Excuse me. I've got what you've been waiting for. As I explained on the boat, Chobei the Carpenter drew up the plans for the Foreigners' Quarter. This is very thorough. Right... As planned, Kusaka leads his eight men by the main road. My group will go by boat to the Quarter with the explosives. Rendezvous at the cherry trees in Gotenyama. We'll all set off now. Remember your code names. Sky. Black. Earth. Yellow. Heaven... Has... No... End. Sun. Moon. Eclipse! - Master Takasugi... - What is it? You want your money for the plans? - Yes. And I have a favour to ask. - A favour? No, please don't! Come on, I just want to see if we're suited. I've heard about reading palms but never the feet! Only our feet will reveal if we're compatible. Stop it! I won't show you until we're married. Ohisa, it won't make much difference. Someone's coming. Look at you two! Reading her feet? Good excuse. - Grifter, what are you up to? - Come on, we're leaving. - What's going on? - No questions. Let's just go. But... Once I let you out, I won't be able to stay here. - Are you sure? - It's high time I left. I'll see you in ten years to collect the money. Let's go. Hurry. Look out, it's slippery. - Thanks for waiting. - Hurry up. - Very well, sir. - Excuse me. Sir, if you don't mind me asking... Another favour? Can you marry them before the boat trip ends? A wedding on the boat? Very well. - Mr Grifter... - No weeping now! Behave! Thank you. Young master, you have a new life. Remember, don't trust anybody. - I certainly won't. - Grifter... My watch has stopped again. Fix it for me. Off we go. - I'll collect it when we meet again. - Very well. And when we meet again... Yes, I know. You'll get the repair fee. That's a bad cough. Will you live to see me? Oh, I will, sir! You're too good to be a samurai. Don't flatter me! That's all taken care of. - Now it's my turn. - Mr Grifter? Where have you been? Room 5 is waiting! Thank you, sirs. Tend to the man in Oyoshi's room! Thank you, Governor! Mr Grifter, you're needed! - Enjoy yourselves. - Mr Grifter! Mr Grifter, meet me after closing time. Grifter, dear! Meet me after closing time. Fire! Fire! - Look at it burn! - It's in Gotenyama. - What, in the Foreigners' Quarter? - It's arson! Grifter, my dear, you can see it better from here! I've got a better view here, Mr Grifter. Up in smoke! Nothing burns like the Foreigners' Quarter! In times of upheaval... Oh, I have to go! We have a business to run and everyone's watching the fire! Close. Right, everyone, you've had your fun! It's nearly closing time! - Mr Grifter! - Oh, it's you two. What on earth are you up to? I have to leave early in the morning. Thanks for all your kindness. You mustn't leave. I want to marry you when my contract's up. I've had many men, but I want to spend my life with you. That's my line! In times like this, looks don't matter. A man must have nerve and wit, just like you. - Be with me! - No, be with me! Grifter, dear, you have to choose one of us. Which one do you like better? Sorry, but I can't sleep with women. When I was grifting around the Yokohama settlement, I had a chest pain and Dr Hepburn saw me. He told me, '"No women.'" - I knew it, you have TB! - I thought you looked pale... I've been feeling better lately. I'll go to Yokohama tomorrow, and if the doctor says I'm fine... I'll follow Dr Hepburn and grift my way to America. I'll go with you. Don't go so far away. Have a happy life here with me. Oh, happiness is what I dread. What do you mean? Besides, going back and forth between here and America sounds too much. Stop joking around! Grifter, dear, I promise myself to you in this letter. Me too! I wrote it myself, it's genuine. I have a stack of them for sale. I want to get going before sunrise. - Excuse me! - Wait, Grifter! Help me! Koharu's patron won't go to sleep. I'm rather busy. Koharu, take care of him. Is that Mokubei? No, thank you. Osome, he used to be yours. You go. I pretended that I'd died of measles, and then you got him. The man makes me sick! I have fits just thinking about him! He's impossible, Grifter. Only you can help us. - Please, please... - All right, I'll go. - Grifter, I'll be waiting. - Me too! - What room is he in? - Number 6. Sir, I'm opening the door. Eh? Go ahead, open it. There's nothing embarrassing going on. I'm on my own. It's about Koharu... I heard that Koharu's sick. What's wrong? What kind of sickness is it? Don't mess around, tell me straight. It sounds like she's sick all over. All over? Where exactly? I think it's her kidney or liver... Nobody mixes up the kidney and liver, you idiot! - Well, I think... - Where's the doctor? Well, he's... How bad is it? What's acting up and what's going down? Come on, talk straight like I do! You hear me, you useless fool? Very well, I'll give it to you straight. In fact, Koharu fell sick and dropped dead. What, she's dead? Oh, my... Oh, my! She's dead? She's dead? My condolences, sir. - Where's her grave? - In the neighbourhood. - Take me there. - You must be kidding. It's almost dawn, so take me there, you lazy fool! I'll tip you. But... Excuse me. Hey, don't run off! I won't run off, sir. I'll take you there, but I just have to get ready. I'll be here waiting. Won't be long. Where have you been, you lazy ass? And what's with the outfit? - Why are you here? - Hey! Hurry up and take me there. Where's her tomb? If I recall correctly, it's either to the right or left. Stop messing around. Of course it's to the right or left. Too many tombs... Pick any one. - What? - Nothing. There! It's that one. This is Koharu's? It's so unkempt. Hey, sweep it with that broom over there. Hail, Merciful Buddha... Eh? '"Year of the Hare, 2nd Year of Ansei Era...'" Hey! This person died in the 1855 earthquake. Oh, I see. I mixed it up with the next-door neighbour. This is it. What's wrong with you? That one's huge and this one's tiny. I don't have much to do with graves. Don't be silly. We all end up dying and resting in our graves. I'm too young to worry about that. You never know, you do have a bad cough... You've become this little piece of stone... I hope you go straight to heaven. Her dharma name is '"Child-Playing-In-The-Dark...'" '"Child'"? This is a child's tomb! Young man, where's her real tomb? Choose any tomb you fancy, sir. Hey, keep lying like that and you're sure to go to hell! There's no heaven or hell! I have my life to live. You're going to hell!
