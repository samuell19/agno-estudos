And therefore the idea of retirement just seems to me ... Yes, I understand. But there is, however, a labour market. We are obliged to take them into account. Marithe, sorry to interrupt, but the Monjouet group's arrived. I'll end with this gentleman and be with you right away. - Ok. - Well, Mr. Garanger. Come back at the end of the week and we'll work on a project a little more realistic. OK? Then... here really we do individual training. Now, imagine the shape of a rhombus. Before we open the field of possibility, and then we re-centre to find professional projects suitable for your core competences. I think that's clear to all? For me not very clear. It's good if you can introduce yourself first. All right, I'm Cynthia. For me it's not very clear. For me, I didn't really unerstand! In fact, let's start from your experiences, on your skills, you are all skilled workers, to find the training that matches the best to each one of you. Ok. As I said, individual training. Excuse me, Carole. Will it also work for a for someone who's never exactly been a worker? You mean that at The Monjouet - you have never worked in production? - No. After a dismissal so brutal, it's absolutely normal to feel lost or frightened. But you should know that here, we are really here for you. Now I'll ask you to fill these individual sign-up forms. Anyone need a pen? Yes. Pass behind you? At least you could give her appointment in a bar! Ah, here they are. - You're almost late! - It's not true, I'm punctual. - Oh yes? - Today I had the workers of Monjouet. All those women without jobs, suicidal! That sucks, every time you say the same thing! You're still with us, but! Love, be a little friendly, for once! It's her birthday. - Hello! - Hello! Watch out for your legs! Hello! Go, Pierre will direct you. - We're not going to the Tai? - Eh, no! - Straight ahead! - It's a surprise! You'll see! But are you crazy inviting me to dinner here? - It's going to cost a fortune! - Do not worry! You'll see. You're gonna love it. Oh my, it's so chic and romantic. It's a bit of a waste to come with you, no? - Because? You have other friends? - What an asshole! At least, you know what I mean? It's a place that is in fashion. Nothing else! - Good evening. - Good evening. I have a reservation, Perusel. Yes, sure. If you want to give me your coats. - Thank you. Oh no, I will keep mine, thank you. - Good evening gentlemen. - Good evening! It's Augustin, - Augustin who'll take care of you. - If you'll follow. Off you go. smoked egg with yellow carrot, tuna in jellied raspberry and sea bass mousse in teriyaki sauce. - Enjoy! - Thank you. How strange, that woman... I saw her this morning, She was with the workers of Monjouet. But what's she doing here? Who cares? Eat, it's a delight! - Hello! - Ah, Theo! - Have you already ordered? - Not yet. Another! It's my birthday. - Hello! - Hello. - Hello, Nathalie. - You ok?! Oh my God! Bloody hell, how good is that? But Mom! - Sorry? - Some bread. This meal is the best thing that's happened since ... - Since the birth of Theo? - No, since we divorced! No, frankly, it's better than, it's better than all of it! Of all? How can say that after after you were married to me? Oh, I, don't really know, darling! - Amnesia! - Yes! Oh no, you've not done that for me? Yes we have! Here is a special cake with Sam Drissi strawberries. - Happy birthday. - Thank you. - You all right, that pleased you? - It was perfect. Thank you, thank you. So, I understand that there's a birthday? - Who's the birthday girl? - It's her. Ah good, and as it's a lady I won't ask her age. But certainly, it doesn't show! Ah hah... you think I am older than I look? - Pardon? - You said that I do not show my age. But you does not know my age. Therefore, you suppose I must be older than I look! Really, I just wanted to pay you a compliment. - There's something you don't like? - Come on, try the cake! Maybe sugar will neutralize your upset. There you go... It's good! It's our speciality cake, here at the Moulin Blanc. And also my wife's favorite... - She's your wife? - Yes! You know her? Err yes, we've already met. Carole, can you come? The lady says that she know's you. Ah, yes, we met at the gym. You also spend your life in the gym? It's what, this pleasure women have in suffering so much? Especially if there's someone who loves you as you are. Yes, it's true, I really don't know at all why we do that. Now excuse me, Sam. There are still many orders. Sorry, I must leave you. Good evening. Such a beautiful restaurant and wonderful couple. You can certainly say that there're people who lead a perfect life, yes? Ah, me, I would never say that. I'll think about. 'Till Thursday then. 'Till Thursday, yes. - Good morning. - Ah, good morning. I wanted to apologize for embarrassing you the other night, at the restaurant. It was very kind of you to keep my little secret. Well, you see, professional secrecy also exists for us. Although I prefer not having to lie. Yes, certainly I understand, I am very sorry. I should I do my competency test, now? - Can I do it with you? - Ah... yes, ok. Come along. I hope at least you did not take me for a pathological liar! You know, it 's just that I'v not made my husband aware of my needs since we are rather well known, because of the restaurant. And you thought to do an competence test, because you see yourelf changing profession? Frankly, I don't know what I envisage. All I only know is that I have to do something. I went to a dermatologist, by an allergist and an acupuncturist. She thinks that the cause is your job? Every night when I go down to work at the restaurant it burns me so much that I want to tear at my arms. What precisely is your role at the Moulin Blanc? Owner, or official taster, public relations ... In fact, I do not know what my profession is. I do not have a precise role. You know, in the cases of disatisfaction in the workplace, It's not necessarily nature of the work that's the cause. Sometimes a change of scene, or team, or even timetable, can already be enough to feel much better. But not in my case, because... the scene is my house and the team is my husband! So, we'll simply assess your best professional memory, and your best memory non-professional, and your greatest professional regret and non-professional. Right... it's rather personal, no? So then, my best professional memory: I'd say when we got our first star and the title of 'Master Restaurateur'. And non-professional... when I met my husband, obviously! My greatest professional regret: that I left my studies. My greatest private regret: not having had children. I could not. I wanted to adopt, but for Sam the process was too hard. The procedures for adoption were too long, but to open a new restaurant, that's not a problem! - You're opening a new restaurant? - Yes, you didn't know? Yes, the newspapers have already reported. It was Sam's idea to to create a Moulin Blanc bistro, in the town centre, in Rue des Sept Dormants. Just talking about it, I already feel exhausted. I note that in all your memories your husband is always at the centre. Well, the Moulin Blanc, that's him. The talent, the force of personality, that's him. There can be no doubt about that. So I just have to smile at customers - And scratch until death, no? - Oh no, not at all, Carole. You'll discover that you have developed many more attitritubes than you have imagined. You think? I'm happy to be with you rather than with that other one, who looks like a prune! Michel? Excellent trainer. Yes, but among women there's better understanding, especially if you're more or less the same age. and at an important crossroads! - An important crossroads? - But yes! - You don't understand what I mean? - No. - Now, do you feel ready for a new test? - Yes. What you have done? It's a terrible job, it sucks! Sorry. - Marithe, right? How are you? - Fine thanks. - Come to see Carole, to see the work? - No no, not at all! I was passing by here by accident. I'll show you around. I cannot ignore a friend of my wife, especially if it's my fault you do not see her more. Between the gym and the your lunches in town! - Pardon? - Here it is! Take care not to get dirty. Wait, give me the bag. Also, I'll take the handbag? Carole will have told you what we want to do for our tapas menu. - Well ... - Here, the kitchens. Here we bake our own bread. - You bake bread? - Oh yes, it's easy. You should try. There 's nothing better in the world That eat your own bread. It's, well, mythological! I'll show you the upper room? - Here it is. - Oh yes. - It 's cute, right? - Oh yes. Here there are 30 seats. You know, I have a lot of love for the Moulin Blanc, but, I felt the need to renew, to discover new horizons. It excites me more than in 20 years! - Take me for crazy, huh? - No no, not at all. No no, on the contrary. I'm glad to see someone passionate about what he does. I enjoy it because I always deal with people who do not love their work. What is your job? Carole did not he tell me. I work with vocational training for adults. The headquarters is close by. - Interesting. Do you like? - Yes, I really like it. When people change profession, they are better off, For me it's rewarding. - You have something for, errr? - Pardon? Wait... That's a good idea! Ok, I'll explain to you. Here is the cold room. Here we broke down the two partitions to enlarge the kitchen and here I'll install my oven. There? There? Well yes, there. Here you are. - I have to go. - OK, well. The ceiling is dirty, yes? It 's really a job for ... - Oh, I'm so sorry! - Oh dear! All right? You hurt? No, not bad. I just had a shower! Come on, lower your head. - Huh? - Lower your head. Lower your head. There! That's a nice perfume. Some women in the restaurant would like it. Huh? mmm... fresh bread, pears and mushrooms. - What? - Yes, it's what you smell of. - See you soon? - Yes. I'll tell Carole to organize a lunch. - After the gym? - Yes fine. See you soon. Look, now that I think of it, You will need staff here. - You've already found them? - For the kitchen, yes. For the dining room service, I've not looked yet. I think I might have the waiters for you, - Would you be interested to meet them? - Yes, why not? - You know what? Call me. - OK. Carole, Carole are you there? - Yes I'm here. - Come down? - But do you mean now? - Yes, right away, I'm ready. Go. It starts from the left. Interesting, but too acidic. OK. Here's the 2nd. Today I met by chance your friend, Marithe. - Ah! And you chatted together? - I showed her the place. She liked it a lot. She's going find some waiters. This is not so good. Little character, the tastes are dull. You'll take an interest in the bistro one day? Your friend found the project wonferful. - You've talked about it, right? - No, we haven't talked about it. Not everything revolves around you and your projects, Sam. I also have my own interests too, because I exist too! Who's said otherwise, who? What is it? Is it your eczema? You've not told me about the third one. Not bad. Yep. Good morning! You're very stylish today. - Good morning, Carole. - You look good with make-up. - It 's a special occasion? - No, not particularly. But thanks. So, first of all I say that I met your husband, by chance. He thinks we're friends, right? But we could be, right? No, excuse me, but if I use it as an alibi and solely in order to come here. But that's not the question, ok? Follow me. So, the idea is to circle, on the list of candidate words, those you think are your main qualities. Right. Decided, obliging, clever, organized, polished. Oh my, that'll take some optimism! You try to do the exercise objectively, without undervaluing yourself. Ok. 'Liar' is not there... Frivolous. That's for me. And I do not undervalue myself. The first thing I noticed coming in was your makeup. You could circle 'Observer'. Yes, 'Observer'. See that you undervalue your qualities, Carole? I am sure that the restaurant is as important to you as your husband. You're so encouraging. Not at all, I say what I see. Do you know that in tests that we do, women systematically see their defects and men their qualities? - Really? - Oh, yes. But yes clear... If Sam did the test he'd immediately circle his merits. It's true that he's very solid, very enthusistic. - He always has so much energy? - Yes, always. And in everything, if you know what I mean. - It's exhausting. - In what way? Sometimes, you need a man to leave you alone , right? Er, yes... I would not know. We continue. OK... dreamer, spontaneous, curious, diplomatic, generous. But no, I was wrong! These are not really professional qualities. Excuse me a moment. Why do not you answer the phone? My birth certificate, I turned over the house but couldn't find it. - You need it? - For the scholarship! - I have to hand in everything today. - I had forgotten. Ok look in the big box in the library. Lunch together? I have no time, Mom. I have to do passport photos. Excuse me. That was my son. I never imagined that you had a son so great. Me neither, I mean... It seems like yesterday he clung to my legs before going off camping. And now he wants to go far away. For a long time. You live alone with him? I had a strong sense that you were also going through a moment like that. - Like what? - You know: the important crossroads. Oh, I'm lecturing you! - You're offended? - No, but. between trainee and trainer using 'vous' [not 'tu'] would be more appropriate. The problem is the customers. - Why customers? - Having to make greetings all day, hello, please and you're welcome, and this and that! Ah, it's sure the boss had the right to reprimand her! Well that depends... ackie, you have to learn to relax, otherwise... because service means kindness - That's for sure, huh? - Ok. Now I propose a brief review of your personal aptitude tests. - Are you sure they will fit? - yes, they will be perfect. Help me now. We will do the role play, because I know you like that. Francoise, you arrange the roles. Then, you are her boss, Cynthia. Perfect, ok?. - Good morning, Sam. - Ah, good morning! Good morning. Apart from a few, are all older. They seem to have one foot in the grave! I thought the idea of th project was clear: It's young, local, cute, trendy. - Frankly, those are all grannies! - No. - No what? - No. You said you want to do a simple and authentic cuisine? Then you have to present it with the simple and authentic people. Me, to advise me on the food, frankly I'd have more confidence in a granny, than those, as you say, in anorexic twenties. You're telling to me how to market a restaurant? Im not talking to you about marketing! I'm talking about people. Those women have lived, experienced, have human value. And that is priceless! You think customers are duped with a little smoke and mirrors? Who makes smoke and mirrors? I make smoke and mirrors, me? And this is smoke and mirrors? Be sure when you want something, huh. - Not you? - Yes. I did not say that you can not do. Wow, you're a genius! You're my idol! All tested! And how you just put him in your pocket. You subdued him! - Are you kidding me? - But no, it was completely enthralling. And Jackie had become almost a sweetie! Really? Stop it, Marithe! After all you are not just a mother. You have your own life, you can even fall in love. If and to fall in love again, no problem! How would it be? Did you meet someone? Huh? Come on tell me! Come on! Forget it! Anyway, the good ones, they are always married. Excuse me for reminding you, Marithe, but... when I met Pierre, he was married. True, but here it's not the same. It is not possible. There's someone I have known professionally, and from an ethical point of view, no, I cannot do that. Can I carve the chicken? And then seeing what you've gained, makes him your sister! - What? - No no, nothing! - Go ahead and carve - Thanks, love. Here we are at the end of our first step today. With the test results, the computer will propose a profession suited to your potential. - Shall we go? - Go! It's like opening Christmas gifts under the tree! I expect to leave here able to do something. Something just for me. FALCONER So, what does it say? Falconer. Falconer! What's that? I guess they are the people who train falcons. I am surprised as you. It has never suggested that. But, it's absurd! It cannot be my vocation! How could I train a falcon? I think that there are falcons in an area where they seek personnel and maybe the computer thinks it would be suitable. Perfect! Even the computer takes me for a nothing ! No, no no! You cannot say that. And especially, try not to have preconceived ideas, huh? Me, for example, I have dealt with a real estate agent which opened a centre for dog toilets. and who is very, very happy with this change. Oh yes? But I do not want to do a toilet for falcons! I see. Falconer. Falconer. Falconer! I think it has a virus Because it's not normal make a single proposal. But you could not reset all data? Listen, Carole, I do what I can I'm not a magician! But shit, it's screwed! Anyway, it's better that we stop now. See you Friday, eh? - Goodbye. - See you, Carole. If we begin to say that the computer has a virus whenever you don't like the profession! Come on, Michel! Falconer? What did you expect? Supermodel? - Belly dancer? - No! Nor stripper. I don't pretend to be a Barbie. I just hoped for a positive return based on your past experience. It also seems legitimate, eh? When you've worked for 20 years to be able to highlight the talent of another! No? Well, that's a normal unsatisfied and frustrated wife. No, I do not know, I feel empty, sad, a nothing. But of course I'd love to do whatever you'd like! There, right now? No no, I cannot. No, it's impossible. Yes, you too! - Carole! - I'll try. I'll call you. - I wanted to apologize to you for just now, really! - No, no no! Yes! Listen, get in I'll give you a lift, if you want. Ah ok, thank you! Pardon me for the problems with the computer. They become crazy. I'm sorry! - You all right? - I don't dare to go home. Look, would you mind dropping at the country club? At the country club? But why there? It's not such a big detour. - You ever been there? - It's beyond my finances. And we should be members, right? Ah, if you don't know it, I urge you come along! We'll drink something together. You'll see, it's a great place. You'll love it. I would spend my life there, if I could. But unfortunately, I do not drive. - Why, you did not have a license? - Yes, I do. I had a bad accident 5 years ago and since then I am afraid of touching the steering wheel. But that's a big problem, Carole. To train you, you must be able to travel. And then for self-esteem, absolutely you must resume. Why not try now? Look, there's no one around. Drive the car? Alright. Let's see the horses. Good life, yes? The Moulin Blanc, the country club. These places are incredible! I feel a bit of an Ugly Duckling here! If you feel at a crossroads, you'll feel out of place everywhere. Ah, you did come! Vincent, meet Marithe. - Hello friend. - Hello. Err, I have no right to say friend, I can say my trainer, It's a bit like a parole officer! Well, I don't know what. Well, Marithé Bressy, that'll do! - The toilets are where? - Over there. Ah, there you are. You disappeared! We looked everywhere. We get a drink? Unfortunately, I have to go. Oh yes? Not right away, I hope. - First we have a drink? - No, I'm going, it's clouding over. But you don't have to come with me. - Well, goodbye. - Goodbye. You saw? It's amazing! I completely relaxed. Thanks to you, because I don't feel you judge me at all. Sam must always be macho. Watch the road! Check the rearview mirror! Well, to look at the road is not really a macho concept. I'm glad that you like the country club. It's in a place like that I'd like to work. The outdoors, sports. But actually, you invited me just because you wanted to meet your lover. - What? - I saw you after the toilet. With the rider, Vincent. I saw in his arms. Okay, I have not talked about Vincent. But it was you who said that our relationship must be professional. So I never know how much I can confide in you. What I can say and what I can't say to you. Oh well! I think the whole transmission is gone. That's bad. I'll reimburse you, of course. It's not just about the money I will lose the bonus for this shit! And what do we do now, in this forsaken place? It will take hours for the recovery. But no, just we call Sam. With the 4x4 he will pull out in 2 minutes. We don't really need to make a drama. But you know that it means fixing the transmission? I thought to would keep this car for three years! Look, it's not my fault! It was you who distracted me. Call your husband, immediately! Right now! Sam, it's all right. Look, I'm with Marithe and we have a small problem with her car. No, not serious, but can you come up with the 4x4? Ah, he's coming! Please, can you do me a favour? Can you say that it was you driving? - Otherwise he'll question. - We'll see. Well, girls? What have we here? - How are you? - Good. Lets see. I can tow it home. I'll call Gerard, He can fix it without an invoice. Carole told me of problems with insurance. Remember that it was you, eh? And if we talk about it, we were at the gym together, Monday evening. So, evidently, you've used me as an alibi for meetings with your cowboy! See you there? OK, thanks. Well, Gerard will join us at the Moulin Blanc I don't think that there is a lot of damage. But, the transmission is bust! I see that you know enough to be a public danger! Oh, Sam! If we could avoid the macho jokes about women drivers! Seriously,how did you finish in the ditch on a road so straight? That's enough! I prefer to call a recovery service - And lose my bonus! - What a character! - But Sam, stop! - No, it's ok. It was just a bit of humor. Stop it! It was me who was driving. Why didn't you tell me? - Ok? - Yes, it's ok. What is happening? You can tell me? You're never there. We don't talk. There's nothing anymore. What's going on in your head? Tell me! I will not talk about it now. - When, then. When we talk about it? - Stop! - Stop what? - Stop! But stop this car! Leave me alone! Please do not do that. Carole, Carole! It's unbearable. I do not have to change jobs. I have to leave Sam. It's ready! You'll eat with us? How about a cognac? Here, it will do you good. Here. Do you know what? It's such a relief you know everything about Vincent. It's not the first time that I've had an adventure, you know? - Huh? - You're judging me? No, no no. It's a breath of fresh air. It stops me from going crazy. Because I just cannot take anymore! I want to leave, breathe, have my own life! I do not love him anymore . It's the truth! I do not love him anymore. With him I choke. With Vincent, I'll live again, you understand? He listens to me, like you. It feels so good to talk to you, You give me confidence, I can't imagine what's good for me. Do you think I'm right, huh? - You think I should leave Sam? - But Carole, it's not for me to tell you. But I'm right, no? Frankly, you can't ask this of me. But to whom? You're my only friend! Carole, Marithe? Carole? - Yes? - The car's ready. Ok, we're coming. Shit! I have to prepare for customers. Above all, he musn't suspect anything until I'm ready to leave. Otherwise, it would be hell! I know it'd be painful for you too. No. don't worry. I understand. Thank you, thank you! Come see, she's as new. I'm really sorry. Are you OK? You're pale. There have been revelations! ...backlash from the accident. You, come with me. Here. - What is? - One of my grandmother's secrets. Energy. - Ok? - A little bitter but going down. - Here. - Thank you. Look, I am very sorry that you find yourself in between all this. I do not know if Carole told you about it, but it has not been a good time for us. And I know that this must be painful for you. In addition I've been an idiot! - No! - Yes Yes Yes. Anyhow, I want to thank you for your response. - Thank you, but I was too hard. - No, no, no, on the contrary! No, on the contrary. I was, I have found you ... ... supportive No, I can not, I can not! I can't. I... Not my style. I can not do it. - But yes... - But yes what? No, I agree. You're right. It's... not good to begin a story... with a situation that's not clear. You're right. I'm going. What this order? What this order? It's not understandable. Write more clear! - Where's Carole? - I don't know. I've not slept a wink. I had a mess in my head! - Tell me about it! - Changing lives so suddenly. - Yes, I know. - In addition... And at our age. We are at an important crossroads. - It's now or never. - Exactly. Did you change your mind? No no. But I've never been independent in my life. - You think I'm really able to do it alone? - But sure you can do it! Obviously. I took advantage of insomnia to repair the computer. And I made out a whole list of proposals for you. Please! You know, when you change the orientation, - Or rather start from scratch - Of course. But I must say that there is necessarily a period of adjustment. Eh! You'll find a job you'll like, Carole. Don't worry! Good morning madames. What'll it be? - A coffee for me. - Two. Two coffees. Even the secretary? There must be someone in the office that's not on maternity? Yes, I'll wait. Yes? Thank you very much. I got it! I've got my place at MIT! My son goes to college in Boston! Bravo, I'm proud of you. See how happy your mother and I are. Mom, are you okay? What's wrong? Theo, it's fantastic. I'm so happy for you. Ok? WINDOW DRESSER, THE CRAFT OF THE FUTURE See that building over there ? And an equestrian center. From what I know, it's for sale. Is it not the ideal place for starting a new life? yes, yes, but I could never manage such a place by myself. Carole, stop! You must become aware of the extraordinary qualities... you developed at the Moulin Blanc. - You really think so? - Of course I do! You have a huge potential. Yes, but do it all alone, however. - And Vincent? What's his profession? - Has an accounting firm. - Oh, great! So boring! - Eh? Believe me, no one does accountant by vocation! On the contary, it means that they have money and the ability to arrange a deal. And what's more, he's a horse rider! Before buying the shares of the equestrian center and then he helps you manage it. It's perfect, right? He could also keep the riding lessons. He's so talented! I would deal with beginners. And children, especially. We might also have ponies! Ponies too, of course! And you could come and work with us. Me? Wouldn't you want to get out of that box? No, no no. Well certainly, sometimes I can't take it anymore, like everyone else, but... Confess! I know that you're like me. You are about to implode. No, it's not that. I just... Oh, you're right! Once my son has left, what do I have left? Nothing! Why can't I have some fun for a change? Right! Then we work together? - You're crazy! - No, not at all! We'll be associates? Oh damn, you've convinced me! We'll be associates! Ah, allow the grand world! ... independence! Allow luxury, and freedom ! - And ponies! - Oh yes, the ponies! Many ponies, thousands of ponies! So, why do I have to come back? Cause I'd like to look deeper... But why do you insist? I've told you that I've no desire to change jobs. Ok? It went well? - Did you do the adjectives test? - Yes Yes. Goodbye. What are you talking about? It's not crazy. How can you talk like that to a friend of mine? Look, she's not a friend of yours. You've only know her for two months. And then I assure you, I found her insistent. You know, pushy. Excuse me! I wanted to tell you. That little meal last time. Oh, it was a marvel. - Pardon? - Usually, I don't like those, but those capers! You know we change the menu next week? There are the sweetbreads with hazelnuts. They are a delight. You really mustn't miss them! Well, I'll run to book! Until the next time! See you soon! So, Carole, we were talking and you... I what? I do my work and I do it very well. And thanks to Marithe, I became aware. Oh, my love! If you make a little effort. I'm sure she might help you too. Stop, Carole! I'm good , I'm fine where I am. Come! Here, they have brought this for you. Oh yes? Don't you think it's a bit too much with the family of the Moulin Blanc ? Now they you give this? Look Michel, you have to be flexible at times. Who was that guy who came for an interview a little while ago? - Oh, fuck! - Pardon? Taste. He just wants to do a training course or to change jobs? Look, there the meeting. Excuse me for my conduct the other night. I hope it didn't spoil our friendship. I'm counting on you being at the opening of the bistro. With friendship, Sam. You are welcome. That's delicious! - Hello! - Oh! - Hello! - Good evening, Marithe ! Carole is over there. Thank you. You know each other well? Excuse me. Excuse me, excuse me! - No thanks. - As you want. It hard to follow the diet tonight. - Good evening! - How are you? - Some champagne? - Yes, thanks! - Great success, eh? - Yes! I can never thank you enough for this job. - Mr. Sam is brilliant. - You following the management course? Yes, I hope to soon be on the cash desk. Hello Marithe, the owner wants you to taste this. Jackie! The chef wants you! Ok, but who cares! I wanted to create a convivial space, to get the feeling of cooking for my friends. It was my dream, and this environment was ideal, comfortable but not too refined, elegant but not pretentious. And also the staff reflects it. Marithe, the equestrian center can we forget it? Vincent did not take it well when I asked him to invest money. I feel he's angry with me. What you need is a whole weekend together. A whole weekend? Impossible. Would you do that with me? An intensive fitness weekend with you? Certainly! I'm working a bit too much, We have to get back in shape, yes? - An entire weekend would be wonderful! - Oh yeah! But what would I use as an excuse? It'll be fine, don't worry. I'm looking for a training course for you. What you need and internships which will take you directly into a job. Training for what? In which area of work? It doesn't matter. Who cares? Carole, you must not feel limited. No! yes but, even so. Excuse me Mdme. Drissi. I must present you to the deputy mayor. Excuse us for a moment? Shit, shit! It's not serious, Jackie. But I'm still on probation! - I'm totally screwed! - Do not worry. Oh shit, the master! Jackie, what happened? No, absolutely my fault. - It is not possible! - No, I swear, she passed with the tray. Listen, come with me. Come! You know, they're very motivated, but they must have time. Do not worry, they will learn. - That's a... take. - Thank you. And some dish soap, removes grease stains. However, I am quite satisfied. Customers appreciate them and then I am a bit busy with you, right? Yes, a bit. I'm all wet! And I do not want you to take me for being too correct. I think that if I hold my hand here in front, - TLike this, then I can go. - Yes. - Yes? - Yes. Fine thanks. indeed, the pre-employment internship. But don't fool yourself, you know how the Chamber of Commerce is. Blocked lists since January. Pascal, I absolutely need a place. And I absolutely need a holiday in the Seychelles! But it's like your place, just wishful thinking. Come on, there's always someone quitting! 30 people on the waiting list. Please, put it in the list. Impossible! This is really urgent, you know?. My candidate is super competent. But her husband is violent! You must find a way out. - And with 5 children! - 5 children? Listen, I've done you many favors, Pascal. Get me a place and I swear I will not forget. Oh, fuck! Well, but I want the complete dossier in my office for Monday evening. Sure, you'll have it! Oh, shit! Hey Carole, it's Marithe. Listen! Call me before you leave for the weekend, I have the perfect lacement for you! Later! Yes , Carole, Marithe again. I hope the weekend of love goes well. But I would still need your response for the super, super placement. It;s urgent. Kisses. But no, what the hell? Yes? It's a form for the Chamber of Commerce. I need your stamp. - There are already ? - The parameters, signature, social security number, The placement, the letter of intent, etc. Everything except your stamp. A moment. Yes? Marithe ! - You're not in the kitchen? - No, no. Look, what was this invention of the fitness weekend? What's she been telling you? Since Carole been, she's in crisis. She does not get out of bed. Well, I need to see her. Because I think I caught the same virus. Carole? Carole? Carole! What's going on? What happened to you? Why have you not called for 4 days? The weekend was a disaster. It's over with Vincent. - Thing? - He doesn't love me anymore. He left me. Shit. I'm sorry. It's sad, very sad. But, now you have to get dressed right away, Because we have to be in the Chambers of Commerce at 11. - Huh? - The placement, Carole, the placement! We've only a half hour to rush over there! But I'm in no condition for a placement. I have to decide what do with my life. But, it's already all it decided. You want a divorce, finding a job and become independent. There you are - that's what you want. And this this placement will allow you to have all that. And also to forget right away that imbecile Vincent. There! No, not an imbecile. It just for those aptitude tests and he felt manipulated. I think I wanted him to be another Sam. Oh, what an idiot! I don't know, perhaps he was right. Maybe I should rebuild my marriage, If it's not too late. Of course it's too late! Your marriage is ended, What are you talking about? You cannot want that! Look, let's go. We'll talk about everything peacefully on road to the Chamber of Commerce. Get dressed now. Hurry up! But I don't care about your placement! Listen, Carole, you have to do it. I am committed to you, I signed in your place. - You can not ruin me. - You have imitated my signature? But I never said I wanted the damn placement. What made you do that? For your sake, I did it for your own good. But you've gone out of your mind? You cannot decide for me! Are you kidding? Vincent was right, you're crazy! Get out now! Leave me alone! Get out! Marithe! Wait for me, let's stop with the lies. - What? - Tell me what's going on with Carole. - What? - Something's going on between you. It's clear that you take me for an idiot. - No, no no! - What game are you playing? You're playing with me! Me? But I've never played with you. I'm honest with you, Sam. Believe me, I beg you. I never wanted to lie to you. But how can I believe you? - Here? - No, where you have your finger, look. I don't know, Marithe , I don't see anything. I don't see anything at all. And yet I swear that itches me so much. A terrible itch. I don't see anything. But I must tell you, dentists are no dermatologists. Look, you want me to prescribe a light anti-anxiety medication? An anti-anxiety for eczema? Im not crazy! It itches like crazy. But it itches, I scratch! I don't know what I'll do. I'm desperate. I don't understand anything anymore. Nathalie, I think I'm becoming a whore. - Hello. - Hello. Marithe ! I just came from Pascal, he's furious with you. for the placement at the Chamber of Commerce. I looked at dossier Carole Drissi. Am I wrong or was it you that wrote the reasons? And the signature does not match the one on the registration form. It was you? And then the guy the other day said that your forced his hand. Doesn't appears in the planning or the dossier. Are you wearing to makeup for the private consultations here? Marithe , you realize what you're doing? You no longer respect the rules, or ethics. You're mixing the private with the professional? You don't talk anymore about the dossier with your colleagues. This does not mean anything to you? - What? - Transgression, insulation, private and professional confusion. Well yes , they're all symptoms of nervous exhaustion. All symptoms of nervous exhaustion. I'm having a nervous breakdown? Oh shit. And what happenst when one loses control? Sick leave, psychological support, a dozen sessions to start. Recentering on non-professional activities: hobbies, leisure. And if it does not pass in three months, I'll do an aptitude test in view of a relocation. Good morning. I am so glad that you have called me! I'm so ashamed of how I treated you the last time. I was too shocked, I didn't know what I was saying. No, it was absolutely normal that you react like that. Carole, I made a lot of irregularities with you. - beause you became so involved. - No, no. There are so many rules and a code of ethics to protect the interns. But I have not protected you at all. It's inexcusable. So I really want to present my apologies. You're joking! Of course, I forgive you. Marithe , must not undervalue yourself, You always told me that. What I told you about your potential and your skills It was absolutely sincere. You must believe me. But from here I will follow more your dossier. You don't want take care of me anymore? No, I cannot take care of you anymore. Nor anyone else, because I'm leaving my job. - Because of me? - But no, no! Because of what I did to you. Come on, you did it for friendship! No. I did this to take your husband away from you. - What? Sam? - Err, yes, Sam. But I reassure you, It has not worked at all. Sam loves you. And I think you're right in wanting to save your marriage. Anyway, I promise not to approach him again. It's not possible. It's not possible, I don't believe you! You can't have done that. Yes, I did. I do not feel well, it's such a turn around! You ok? I feel faint. - What can I do? - Find me a bag. I have to breathe in a bag! - A bag? - Look for bag! errm... Hey! There! You cannot know how ashamed I am . I'm mortified. I'm so sorry! - It's horrible! - Yes, I know. I know. No, this bag is horrible! It's full of fries! - How could you do that? - Excuse me, I took the first I found. I'm talking about Sam, idiot! Liar, whore! I thought we were friends. 6 MONTHS LATER - Marithe ! - Hello! - You are a flower! - Thank you. - Nice to see you again! - I have a gift! So you think that I'm going to be really bored when I retire? Thank you. - Ah! - Oh, it's the same. Another fishing rod. No matter, no matter. - Here, Michel! - Thank you, Francois. Thank you. I'll give you mine later! This is from the secretaries. Thank you. You were my model, my absolute model. A lighthouse. What you did for the Monjouet women was brilliant. But now you've also given it to yourself. Hey, Michel seems in high spirits! Oh, hello! Did you find a good job in a consortium of organic wines, eh? Bravo, congratulations! Thank you. But if after 20 years here I had been unable to compile a bombproof work application! - But you like it there? - Yes enough. But frankly it's only a step. Marithe ! - Cynthia! But what are you doing here? - I work here now. But it is not possible! And the bistro? Well, that didn't go very well. And the management course? Nothing, everything went awry. He's has also changed all the waitresses. I don't want to talk about it. - You need something? - No. Oh yes! SORRY WE ARE CLOSED Marithe ! - Good morning. - Good morning. But where did you go? I looked for you everywhere, to no avail. Even at training center. They you said you had left work. Yes, actually. But women of the Monjouet are still very important for me. I know that you have let them go, I would like to know why. - You're here for that? - Sure. Look, you have been misinformed. One of the older ones has retired, it's true. But the others are still here. - And Cynthia? - She was fired. She was fired? Because? It's complicated. - Because? - There was a thing... The situation had become untenable. And so she preferred leave. There it is. A 'thing'? You slept with Cynthia? You slept with Cynthia? With me you couldn't betray your wife! You were a perfect husband! But with a little 25 year old bitch... goodbye moral principles! She's not a whore. No. But I'm too stupid. You could not tell me to my face? That you didn't like me, huh? And you were fucking the little waitresses! Sorry, but I must lay the tables now. Yes, maybe take a short cigarette break, Jackie? Usually, I take it at 21:30. Exceptionally can you not take it now? Yes, but I'll still need a cigarette break at 21:30. So, tonight you'll have 2 cigarette breaks. Ok? - Ok. - Thank you. - Good evening, Marithe. - Good evening, Jackie. You've well screwed me. You've badly humiliated me. Look for me it wasn't like that. When I think of all the shit I did because of you! - What shit you did do because of me? - Bastard! Asshole! You're well-matched to and deserve Carole! Her, and her little Vincent and his cowboy cock! - And you, with your whore Cynthia! - Stop it! You're a beautiful couple of liars, assholes! Stop, stop! I have not betrayed Carole, if you must know. We were separated when there was Cynthia. And you had disappeared from circulation! - You have you separated? - Yes. She left me five months ago. - She didn't she tell you? - No. Well see you and I Carole. - I'll help you. - No thanks. - Did you know Carole had a lover? - No. - And Jackie? She knew about you and Cynthia? - No idea. - Maybe I'd better go. - Maybe, yes. The TGV 7:15 to Marseille and is on platform 7. It's platform 2! I'm going to buy some food, I'll be there. Wait a moment, help me! You said portable luggage! Give me this. Well ok, thank you! Call us from Brussels? I'm afraid you'll miss the plane. How can we miss it? It gets in nine hours before! Indeed, but if you take a nap you could miss the plane. - What logic, idiot! - What idiotic logic? Do you think you can fall asleep for nine hours? And an idiotic logic! - Maybe you get distracted window shopping. - Is this a fighting party? - Yes, you are right. - Take this, the computer. I'll go, I'll wait outside. - Don't fight, you promise me? - Don't worry, I promise. It's done. He's gone. It's over, Marithe. He's gone, my little boy! ?? Yes, no, I do not know. Come on. Well of course they are more prepared. I knew it would be tough. With Theo gone, you're all alone, now. [??] Why haven't you rebuilt a life? - What has prevented you? - I do not know. Anyway, now it's too late. Too late? Don't be silly! I was very much in love with you. But you were much happier with Nathalie. Thats not the point. Our son has gone. Somebody must love you! Move your ass. - Ok, but if there's someone ... - Yes, agreed, but it's not you! - I've got 2 minutes! - Sure, go. Were not so small! Pass the children their coats! Good evening. Excuse me, but isn't it closed today? No, the restaurant is reserved for a wedding. - Oh, shit! - 200 covers. Could you tell the chef that Marithe is here, please? Ok, hold this. Thank you. Sorry!
