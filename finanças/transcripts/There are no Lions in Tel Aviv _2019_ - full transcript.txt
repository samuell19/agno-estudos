THERE ARE NO LIONS IN TEL AVIV A film by Duki Dror It was the apple of my eye. What did Tel Aviv have back then? You tell me. Some sands, yards with dunes, where we used to fight in all sorts of kids' games. That's all we had. We had nothing here. Nothing. There was a zoo. There was a lion there, and a leopard. And monkeys that we'd feed, even though it wasn't allowed. And there were peacocks on the hill, and deer, and there were bears, who used to bathe... Oh, we had a giraffe in our zoo. Yes, a giraffe! Nobody could believe it, Giraffe! It was a magical place, what can I say... Of all the cultural institutions in Tel Aviv, a special standout is the Zoo. The Zoo has recently moved to its new address, on King Solomon street, near the municipal orange grove. A rare kind of animal is the bear, born in the Himalayas. These bears are very clever and good-natured. They are as playful as children and are agile as monkeys. And here is Dr. Schornstein, the Zoo's founder conversing with his protégé, the parrot, and giving it a Hebrew lesson. What was his name? -Dr. Schornstein. He was a rabbi. -Really? A rabbi who came from Copenhagen, and that was his dream, to create a zoo. And he created it? I didn't know. I didn't know that. As a kid, I always used to go there, with my parents or my grandfather. It was a vocation we went to once or twice a year. Going there was a pleasure. It's an experience that's stayed with me. It had some very lovely features. There was a crocodile pond, with a bridge over it. There was this murmur of dripping water. The Zoo was the most romantic thing of my childhood. My grandparents lived right near there, and I used to go there at least once a week. Every Saturday, I'd go with my grandfather. I know the Zoo very well. I can describe it to you. Every single cage. The gorilla statue by the entrance, and the deer on the right. The monkeys, at the far end. At night, we would hear the elephants and the lions. There was also the Zoo's sharp smell everywhere, but that was a great smell for me, as a kid. Do you remember who worked at the Zoo? Do you remember the keepers? I remember the zookeepers' faces. I remember Johnny. Johnny was the star. He lived at the Zoo. He was dedicated to it. He especially liked the big cats, and would go into their cages freely. Have you heard about Mordecai Schornstein? Schornstein? Yes. Mordecai Schornstein, who was the rabbi of the city of Copenhagen. Schornstein, I think, ended up poor and forgotten. Wasn't there some... dirty business? The story of Dr. Schornstein, the incredible story of Dr. Schornstein, is the story of Israel's Dr. Dolittle. For several years now, my students at Bezalel have been drawing him. The story is a wonderful, sad one, of someone who had an obsession, and a crazy vision, and managed to make it a reality. It's got everything you could ask for in a story, visually and emotionally. It's got love for animals and people, and on the other hand, it's also got injustice, destruction driven by greed, a story of innocence, and of innocence lost. Grandfather, Mordecai (Max) Schornstein, was a doctor of philosophy, and the chief rabbi of Denmark, in Copenhagen. What's a rabbi doing with animals? It's hard to say. There's hardly anyone in our family in that field. When he was with the animals, he was intoxicated. He loved them with all his heart and soul, and he wasn't put off in the slightest by their muck, etc. Anything to do with animals was kosher. I gather he was a relative of yours. You could say that, yes. I wouldn't be here if it weren't for him. I know him from stories. He used to enjoy solitude in nature. He used to go out, to the woods and lakes, and spend hours talking to the animals. He always aspired to live in Israel, but his wife wasn't in good health, and he only emigrated after her death. I think he was 65. He was old, especially for that time. Did he think he would be a rabbi here? No, he didn't want to. He decided to move to Israel and switch his whole life around. Tel Aviv, with its more than 100 thousand inhabitants, Stands in the place which was wilderness 25 years ago. It's a city still expanding, still changing sandy oasis into busy streets. Schornstein came to Israel with two birdcages, and moved to Tel Aviv, rented a store on Sheinkin street, and moved to Tel Aviv, rented a store on Sheinkin street, and started collecting animals. He went to Cairo and brought monkeys, and his fantasy was to make a living selling those animals. A unique shop on Sheinkin street, "unique" being the operative word. That is to say, not one of the kinds of shops we've grown accustomed to seeing in our city, such as general stores, cafes, sausage shops and the like, but a certain shop I saw on Sheinkin street: the shop for various animals and birds, which was opened a month ago by Dr. Schornstein, one of the immigrants from Germany. The shop window is an unusual sight in our town: Not an artificial rotating ice cream cone; not a mannequin, with sharp, painted fingernails; not the wonders of cosmetics or of technics, but a tree branch, and various songbirds hopping and skipping from branch to branch. Over 200 birds, of various species and from different countries. It was quite innovative and unusual. Israel's first pet shop. And the municipality allowed him to take part in the Levant Fair. The Levant Fair was like Europe's International Expo, And it took place in Tel Aviv's port. an exhibition of technological advances, and all kinds of achievements. Schornstein asked to show his animals at the Levant Fair. He arrived with his animals, and a few of the monkeys got away and managed to escape and enter the Polish pavilion, where they reportedly ran amuck. The pavilion had all sorts of Polish exhibits, one of which was bars of laundry soap, and the monkeys started eating them, and... I don't know, blowing bubbles or something, and some of them developed stomach aches. It turned into a whole big thing, and they decided they had to find a place to put the animals. At the time of the fairs, I was... about seven years old. At that time, I saw it happen. He started on Sheinkin street, and moved to HaYarkon street, number 60-something. It was a one-story house, and he set up shop in the yard. Dr. Schornstein's yard. With an act of Shamelessness, Dr. Shorenstein placed a sign "Zoo" on the house in the Yarkon street. Many children flock to the zoo from all over town, the first zoo of their lifetimes. The children love rabbi Schornstein, who knows the languages of deer and monkeys, and who talks to birds. There were all sorts of animals, but the main attraction was the parrot. He had a parrot. A big one. It was famous. We used to go there, and he would put on a show. He would sing. The parrot's name was Valencia. "Ah, Valencia..." And the parrot would answer, "Tra-la-la..." Admission to the zoo was the price of a glass of soda pop. His vision was to create a zoo, to expand it, His vision was to create a zoo, to expand it, and create something for Israel's children to come and see animals. At that time, he beamed with joy. He was known all over Israel as that crazy guy who collects animals. The list of animals who lived with him is quite amazing. He had snakes and a bear, two leopards and two lions, that he was given by the manager of the Cairo zoo. He got them when they were cubs: Gibor and Tamar There are photos of him walking the two lions on Ben Yehuda street in Tel Aviv, on leashes, like dogs. A birthday for a nice couple. A birthday for a nice couple. Gibor, and his sister-wife Tamar, two lion cubs at the Tel Aviv Zoo, on HaYarkon street, and all their well-wishers, celebrate their first birthday today. and all their well-wishers, celebrate their first birthday today. Grandfather was in the same room, with the large predators, with a lion and a bear. Simply unbelievable. What, he lived with them? Yes. Amazing. The neighbors started to lose their minds. Such a large group of animals. The smells, the noise... And on some occasions, animals escaped. The most traumatic one was the bear. The bear managed to sneak out the door one day, and all around town, people panicked. The municipal veterinarian managed to apprehend the bear unharmed, and returned it, but by then, it was obvious a solution was needed, and they searched for a place to start a zoo. The Tel Aviv Zoo was relatively small. It reached a size of 14.000 square meters, but it started much smaller. The original lease was for 2.500 square meters. It started with a collection started by Mordecai Schornstein, in a temporary residence on HaYarkon street, which was just an apartment, unsuited to the needs of animals, and the neighbors complained about the conditions the animals were kept in, and were also afraid of the predators. "It is our unfortunate duty, Sir, to bring up an urgent and unpleasant matter. For several days, we were promised a solution to the matter of the zoo. Despite this, for months, the municipality did nothing about this. We must insist, Sir, that you vacate the premises on HaYarkon street." Schornstein petitioned the municipality several times for a plot of land, and for the municipality to take charge and turn it into a municipal zoo. An association is formed, called "Friends of the Tel Aviv Zoo" They support Shorenstein and promote creating a city zoo, Its members belonged to the local elite: public officials, activists, a wide, diverse and interesting array of people. -Wheeler-dealer? Yes, of sorts. The association collected over 1.500 signatures on a petition to the municipality, which accepted Schornstein's plea and decided to grant him some land in an area known as the municipal orange grove, Fortalice grove. The abandoned grove was at the north end of Tel Aviv. The Zoo, where it was, where Gan Ha'ir is today, was at the edge of Tel Aviv. The far end of town. Wow, 1934. That's when I was born. So they created a map when I was born. Very good. This... This is Tel Aviv! Beautiful. Jaffa, Tel Aviv... Orange groves. Orange groves. There were orange groves all around. For sure. This is Meir Park. Here is Dizengoff Square. You can barely see it. East of Ibn Gabirol street, there's nothing. Oh, this is Sumeil, an Arab village. As kids, we weren't allowed to go there. Kids would get kidnapped. Where's Fortalice grove? Here. This is the orange grove you're looking for. Here, you can see... This is Keren Kayemet boulevard, which today is called Ben Gurion. Keren Kayemet Avenue, wow, There it is. This map has everything. This is the future site of Kings of Israel Square, and the zoo will be here. here. I poked a hole. The zoo will be here. S. Shoshani announced yesterday, at the town council meeting, the opening of rabbi Schornstein's zoo at Fortalice grove to the public. They opened the zoo, and Schornstein donated all the animals to the zoo. He demanded to be named director of the zoo for life. He was well aware of the power of advertising. He realized that in order to get people to the zoo, he had to make it known. He wanted to have posters for the zoo all over town, for five days every month. They printed posters, and cards, and brochures, that were handed out all over town, beautiful ones, by the best illustrators. Guttman was one of them. On every notice board around town, you would see "Visit the Tel Aviv Zoo", and it worked. The zoo presented itself as a zionistic enterprise, to do with the renewed connection to nature and the homeland, part of the process of creating a Hebrew culture, a national culture, as well as a sign of a modern, developed city. A kind of fantasy about life in Israel being normal, just like any other country. In practice, the people who went were people who lived here, both Jewish residents of Tel Aviv and Arab residents of Jaffa and the surrounding villages. On Saturdays, there was a bus from Jaffa that would bring visitors to the zoo. You'd see recent immigrants, locals, children, adults... they would all meet at the zoo. Not everyone saw it as a Western space, or as a place of recreation. Some people went to the zoo hoping to recover from diseases, receive blessings. There are accounts of pregnant women from Sumeil to look at the deer, hoping it would make their children as graceful as does. There are accounts of attempts at taking lion feces in order to help male potency, and snakeskins in order to cure diseases such as cancer. Some days, we stood in line for an hour. It was packed. Packed. There was a ticket office, and... I don't remember the cashier's name. He was fat, bald, big. And we were very scared of him. "Kids, go this way! Not that way." "Do you have a ticket?" I remember the fat guy who used to sit at the gate. His name was Magnus Weinberg. Very fat man. He wore a blue uniform with a blue visor. The beauty of that zoo was that you could reach out and let the monkey take food out of your hand. And I remember one time, when no-one was around, I jumped the fence to the lion, and fed it. Gave it food. I was ten years old. My mother was a widow and I went with her to the zoo, to see the animals. The zoo is empty. Dawn has risen, and only Johnny, the animal trainer, paces among the cages. His majesty, the lion, king of the animals, does not harm a hair on the man's head. And the small tiger cubs play with Johnny lovingly, like kittens. I saw my mother talking with someone in German. She told me he was the main keeper, and that he goes into the lion cages, and the leopard cages... It impressed me too, that someone can be with these large predators and not be afraid of them. Johnny wasn't Jewish. He was German-born. He didn't like Nazi doctrine. He opposed them, and had to flee Germany. He joined a group of Jews who came to Kibbutz Yagur. He moved to Tel Aviv, met Schornstein, saw those pathetic little cages, and took pity on the animals. He offered him his knowledge and expertise, and that's how he started working at the zoo. My mother and Johnny took an interest in each other, and a relationship formed, until finally, they married. They lived at the zoo. Literally. Behind the cages, there was a large house, and that's where they lived. The lioness gave birth to cubs, and she couldn't produce enough milk, so she wouldn't nurse them. They would have left them to die. He couldn't stand to see this, so he took them into the house, and both of them fed them from bottles, and raised them, right in the house, those little lions. A cheetah cub. A leopard cub. Just like a cat, no? Sort of. When they're small, sure. It was the love of his life, those large predators. My mother said he likes animals, and doesn't like kids. Prepare to meet Dr. Chimpanzee, a relative of Man. We are all nothing but descendants of this ape. The chimpanzees have their breakfast using spoons, from a plate, just like kids, and drink milk from a cup, as befits distant relatives of Man. Johnny was one of the most notable characters there. The kids who grew up back then remember him. And did Schornstein continue running the zoo? Yes. After the zoo opened, Schornstein agreed to hand over ownership of his animals and was named the zoo's director. The group started attracting as many visitors as possible, while also striving to add animals to their collection. Through imperial trading networks, since Palestine was part of the Empire, all sorts of attempts were made to procure animals. What about the awarness to animal suffering? Awareness of the suffering of animals only developed in later years. The Tel Aviv Zoo teemed all day yesterday with thousands of adults and children who came to see the zoo's newest guests, and especially the elephant, billed by management as the first elephant here since the Roman wars, when this animal disappeared from these parts. Among the visitors are Arabs from Jaffa, despite the Arab strike on November 2nd. Many of the animals, when they were brought to the zoo, it was a city-wide event. They would go around town, and the people would cheer them. When they brought the kangaroos, they were the first kangaroos ever seen here. It was people's first opportunity to see a real live kangaroo. There was a kind of magic there, that in this small town, just recently built, you can sort of "fly abroad", before that became a thing you do. I grew up with two hobbies: I drew constantly, like a crazy person, I grew up with two hobbies: I drew constantly, like a crazy person, and animals. I loved animals. Before my military service, when I was 17. I made friends with a zookeeper, and told him I drew animals, and he asked for me to work there. So I gained a foothold. I could go in for free, and became an employee there. They let me make signs for the water fowl pond. I drew the water fowls, and wrote their names and descriptions, and they would frame them, for the public to see and read. I would go to the zoo, from school, hand over the signs, and it was a joy. That's where we saw all the exotic stuff. There were no nature documentaries, no shows, no National Geographic. It was an extraordinary experience. The wondrous traits of the electricity fish were on display yesterday at Tel Aviv Zoo. The fish powered an electric bell, lit bulbs, sent morse-code telegrams, and even fired a small cannon. The first year, there were about 60.000 visitors. These numbers doubled, year after year. Truly a phenomenal success. They saw potential to make a lot of money, and too many people coveted the zoo and wanted it, and too many people coveted the zoo and wanted it, and realized that this rabbi, skulking around the zoo in frumpy clothes, wasn't exactly presentable. If you look at pictures of him, he looks disheveled. I think his appearance was eccentric, yes. He would walk around and talk to the animals, and sing to them, and I think they felt they could take it away from him. And that's what they did. My grandfather wasn't the easiest person when it came to interpersonal relationships. He would insist on his opinions, and sometimes lost his temper. Some said he had an easier time with quadrupeds than with bipeds. I know about wonderful things that he did, but the terms of his employment were apparently quite shameful. He was very anti-establishment, his whole life, I think. He had a different, more natural concept for treating animals. Love towards all of God's creatures. There's a story about the pregnant lioness. He said it should be free in order to give birth, and the veterinarian said no, she should be locked up. And all the cubs died. He exploded with rage, and took it out on the veterinarian. He said he knew nothing about animals. A rift began to form between Schornstein and the Friends of the Zoo. They made all sorts of accusations. They said he sold animal food and made money. And they went to arbitration. Schornstein felt like he was the boss, and here come these people, who know nothing, telling him how to handle the animals. Anyway, the tensions grew and grew. One accusation was that over a period of time, he wasn't paid at all. He had to make a living somehow. He went hungry? Yes. When he wasn't paid, he had to make a living somehow. Since he had no money, he used to go to cafes around town, selling photos of himself with Gibor and Tamar, the lions. The version I know is that the municipality wasn't diligent about paying him his salary, and so, one day, he took... let's call it a loan, from the zoo's till, in order to buy food. He went to the zoo's box office, and said he was taking three lira for lunch. They said they weren't allowed to give it. He became very angry. The cashier told him she'd have to report him. He said he didn't care, and took the three lira. That evening, she reported him to the police, and he was arrested. CONFLICT AT TEL AVIV ZOO DR. SCHORNSTEIN BARGED IN FORCIBLY TOOK FROM THE CASHIER "STOLE" THREE LIRA The ongoing rift between the Friends of the Zoo association and its director, Dr. Schornstein, was brought yesterday before judge Dr. Shneor Cheshin; their quarrels, which resulted in Dr. Schornstein himself being reduced to taking, on the evening of August 27th, three lira from the zoo cashier's table. "I was denied all my rights, my dignity and a fair trial, "and they even attempted to steal my livelihood and last remaining joy in life." That's a quote from his words to the judge. "'There was a rule prohbiting giving money from the till to anyone, "'but I am not just anyone', claimed the angry zoo manager, "who is also the zoo's founder and legal owner." The ridiculous thing is that he also donated all the animals, apart from managing it. The judge said that Dr. Schornstein was entitled to take animals from the zoo, or money from the association, but not from the clerks tasked with keeping the money. He is therefore guilty of a technicality, and has pledged, under a 5-lira bond, to six months of good behavior. The judge said he felt ashamed, but had to follow the law. And that was the whole pretext for firing him. The Friends of the Zoo coveted the zoo, and wanted to run it themselves. They decided this had disgraced the zoo, and, right after the trial, they fired him. They reached an agreement with him which gave him a small monetary compensation, on the condition that he would have nothing to do with animals in the cities of Tel Aviv and Ramat Gan. They just wanted to keep him away. And it also said that if he behaved well, they would agree to place a plaque at the zoo entrance, stating that Mordecai Schornstein was the founder of the zoo. His whole life was basically taken from him. It's an incredible crisis. CRUEL ATTACK ON CIVILIANS IN TEL AVIV Do you remember the time the Italians bombed Tel Aviv? One of my worst childhood traumas. The bombing was on September 9th, 1940. It really came out of the blue. Our street was hit by two bombs. The building next door fell on my building. The whole roof collapsed. I peed my pants. I felt it after it was over. It was something awful. Neighbors of ours were killed. Next-door neighbors. We felt that the war had reached us. It was a very difficult time, with the air raids over Tel Aviv. There was a serious concern that the animals would get out of their cages. They gave Johnny a rifle, so that if something happened, he would take care of it. How did he take it? -With great heartache. He didn't want to kill his animals. He said that as long as the cages stood, they weren't to be touched. FOREIGN SUBJECTS FROM ENEMY NATIONS ARE HERE During the war, the British treated him as a gentile, a non-Jew from Germany, and they were arrested in Latrun. They just came in and arrested him? -Apparently. They took them as Germans, who could be a fifth column, and took them to Latrun. It was a camp. It wasn't a prison, it was a closed camp. Johnny was arrested because he was a German subject, and when the war broke out, he became an enemy citizen, and from that moment on, nobody was in charge of caring for the animals. The zoo found itself was in a deep crisis, and made great efforts to have him released so he could return to work. "I am personally appealing to you to do everything in your power "to release Johny Zusia from detainment. His detention resulted in death among the animals, due to lack of care. "Among the animals that died: a bear, a leopard, lion cubs, and ostriches. Respectfully, Israel Rokach, mayor." He wasn't at the zoo at the time of the war. Several Years? -Yes. Several years. When he came back, he went into the leopard cage, who didn't immediately remember him, and pounced on him, but he petted it, and when it felt his touch, it immediately calmed down and started to lick him. Did Johnny tell you what happened to Schornstein? No. They claimed he stole three lira from the till. Schornstein? I didn't know. Maybe that's why we never saw him again. I don't know... what to tell you. After he was fired from Tel Aviv, he moved to Jerusalem, and in the Beit Hakerem neighborhood, he founded the "Bird Paradise". Dr. Dolittle turns a corner. Rabbi Schornstein's Bird Paradise. A parrot chirps: The State of Israel! There were birds there, rabbits... Small animals. One day, a wounded doe arrived. He took it in. He wanted children to connect with animals, so he never asked them for money. He said they could bring some seeds, or help him clean up. He was pretty old then, in his late seventies. He had a talking parrot. Lora. Very colorful. In '48, when the founding of the State of Israel was announced, everyone was in the streets, dancing and singing the national anthem repeatedly, and when we went to the zoo in the morning, Lora was sitting in a tree, singing the national anthem. I'm not sure she knew all the lyrics, but it was certainly the national anthem. That's where Grandfather was until '40... in late 1948, he became ill, and couldn't keep going, and finally passed away. The Tel Aviv Zoo is marking it's 25 year anniversary. 25 years ago, Dr. Shorenstein opened a small animal shop with only a few species. Today, the zoo is spead in a wide area with more than 800 species. Did you hear the name Shorenstien? -Yes. What did you hear about him? -That he was a Rabbi and a Doctor... and that he established the zoo. Did you know that he got fired? -Got fired? Yes. -Why was he fired? The story is that he was not paid, and... -He took something? He took from the cashier because he was hungry. Bastards! Did they want to starve him? Tell us what brought you to the zoo. In 1980, I became the head caretaker at the new zoo, the Safari. The animals were all still at Tel Aviv Zoo. I transferred every one of those animals. Very few of them survive today. I think Motek and Varda are among the only ones who came here from Tel Aviv Zoo. Motek. Motek. Where's your pool? Why can't you go for a dip in this heat? Do you want out of this dungeon they built for you? How old is Motek? Motek is 60. Nobody knows for sure. I've known him since 1961, when he was a cute baby elephant. That's why they named him Motek ("Sweetie"). They brought a handler over from Sri Lanka, and I remember, from childhood, that after they closed the zoo in the afternoon, he used to go with the elephants around the zoo grounds. The Tel Aviv Zoo, I'm talking about the 1960s... In those years, the people who worked there didn't love the animals. They were there for the money. They weren't very patient, and when the elephant wouldn't move, they'd poke his ass with a pitchfork. So Motek didn't like the handlers. There was a foreign worker here, a Pole. I think his name was Kaschpitzki. And apparently, he used to pick on him. They say elephants remember. It happened at night. There was nobody there, and he was drinking. He went into the elephant cage, drunk. Asian elephants have a fingerlike point at the end of their trunks. He used to unlatch the gates. The thing was, the keeper forgot to screw the screw. He closed the gate, but Motek managed to open it. And elephants can walk silently and go undetected when they want to. Motek came over, gave him a nudge, and trampled him. And he was killed. Crushed to death. It was in all the papers: "Animal kills zookeeper". But luckily, they didn't blame the elephant. They learned to be wary of Motek. That's why he lives to this day. I'm preparing breakfast for the chimpanzees and gorillas. Why are you making a salad, why not serving it as it is? I'll tell you. We made them get used to recieving Their food in a clean and orderly manner. And they're used to it. They eat better when it's like this. I tried once to give them their food in a wild manner and I noticed that they haven't touched most of it. Josephina, fat girl. You always eat. You always eat. There, there, fat girl, there. Oh oh, now he's scraming, now he's screaming. Lilly, I told you not to throw it. I told you not to throw it. What are you doing, Lilly? No stealing, no stealing.. Oh, that's how you'll get one. Look at your hands. Dirty hands. Phooey, phooey, Lilly. What kind of hand is it? Go, take your hands of here.. Are you upset? Are you upset, Lilly? There, Lilly, don't be upset. Dont be upset.. Don't be. What do you want? An egg? Do you want an egg? There, eat it. Do you like it? Give Josephina a piece. oh no, oh no.. Don't throw it! Oh no, I'll kill you. I'll kill you. That's why he lives to this day. That's why he lives to this day. That's why he lives to this day. Tel Aviv is developed rapidly, and the zoo area which was full of orange groves was built up very quickly. The new City Hall is buit right next to it. They said that the mayor had the best view from his office window. The're some monkeys, and they make noise sometimes. I don't think I got used to animals. The parrots. The parrots are the worst. They're very noisy. Around the zoo, they were constantly building very high-quality apartments. Just now, a building was constructed that has very expensive apartments, Just now, a building was constructed that has very expensive apartments, and the distance between these buildings and the zoo is only six meters. It's noisy. They feed the animals around noon, apparently, and then... Words can't describe it. It's a battlefield. The peacocks... All the animals, together. The clucking chickens wake us in the morning, to say nothing of the hippos! For my mom to put a baby to sleep, she has to fight tooth and nail, and if some animal suddenly screams, it wakes up again, and she gets very cross! That's what tipped the scales. The people sent a petition to the mayor, to remove the zoo. There was a terrible noise problem, as well as the smells. It stank! Listen, there are the droppings, the food sometimes rots, and the smells all mix together, and it's very unpleasant to live next door to a zoo, That I can tell you. My father bought a house in northern Tel Aviv. We went up to the house, and I went to sleep in my room, and suddenly, we heard screaming, out of this world. I was so scared, I hid under my bed, shaking. My mother had suspected something, so she came and found me. She found me under the bed and said, "Let me explain what we have next door. "There's a zoo here. "There are animals, people come, there are lions, leopards, "and the sounds you hear are the sounds of all the animals that live there." Just so you understand, my balcony was barely 100 meters from the zoo. It was that close. I was intrigued. I started going there, by myself, and people would ask me, "Hey, Kid..." "Yeah, I live right there." "Oh, you live nearby? In that case, come on in." They let me in, and I remember seeing people working there, laborers, with wheelbarrows. So basically, instead of going to school, I would go to the zoo. They saw that I was serious, that I kept coming, and I always said I wanted to help. They said "No problem". I used to go in with the wheelbarrow, give them food and water. I did all that, and I was the happiest kid in the world. Until something happened which turned my life upside-down. One day, I get to the zoo, and I see a dead pheasant. A beautiful male, dead. I'd never seen a dead animal. Lightbulbs started going off in my head. "What do I do? "I want to preserve this beautiful bird." When nobody was looking, I hid the bird under my shirt and ran home. I went to the kitchen, and took black pepper, salt, flakes of laundry soap, and I stole a razor from my dad. And I cut it open, and did what I had to do, put it in a cupboard, and closed the door. A day passed... No problem. Another day passed... It started to smell a bit. My mom asked, "What's that smell?" I said "I don't know, must be the zoo". By the third day, I noticed it really started to stink, so I took my great treasure and buried it in the yard. The main caretaker at the zoo was a man named Johnny. I asked him, "Johnny, "How do you do 'Stofftier'?" That's German for "stuffed animal". So he told me a little bit, what to do, more or less. So you became the zoo's taxidermist? No. I was... I wasn't the zoo's taxidermist. I did it for myself. My room was full of animals from the zoo. There wasn't room to set foot. I stuffed animals I could never get today. I could basically do whatever I wanted at the zoo. That was the best time. Until the zoo was closed, dismantled, sold. That land is worth billions. It's a central spot in Tel Aviv. There was corruption there too, between you and me, around that land. I didn't work at the zoo. I went there as an employee of the Safari. The idea was to bond with the animals before they were moved to the Safari. My memories from Tel Aviv Zoo are very sad. One of the worst things was the concrete floors they had there. I don't know why they left it like that all those years. It's just like putting a person in prison. It's the same thing. They put you in a 4x4 cell, and all you can do is go crazy or pace the cage or the cell. The apes were the most heart-wrenching thing there. I could go into the leopard cage. I know I would be safe. I wouldn't dare go into the chimpanzee or gorilla cages, because they were really violent, with severe psychological problems. Because they were so isolated, with no playthings, Because they were so isolated, with no playthings, they used to play with their feces. That's all they could play with. It was awful. The zoo's employees were municipal workers. Some of them loved the animals. Some of them just worked there for a job, for employment. They weren't interested in the animals, they just did as they were told. The municipal employees weren't reassigned to the Safari. They were let go, all of them. Some of them were in their fifties, and that's all they'd ever done. They didn't really know how to do anything else. They didn't really know how to do anything else. They didn't know how to handle being fired, and felt very lost. These are my bears. I raised them from cubs, and then they were sent abroad. Here's a picture. To leave everything... I wish my life ends before I leave this job and the animals. As they said in the paper, "They did their job, now they can go home". They were helpless. They had no idea what to do in their new situation. They couldn't go up to the mayor's office and start breaking tables, so they took their pain and their outrage out on the animals. One day, we got there and the cockatiel cage was empty. They had the keys, so they came at night and opened the cages. The cockatiels flew out into Tel Aviv. Another day, the spotted deer went missing. They were all grazing in the field. We started rounding them up there. There was a black leopard there called Sambo. One morning, I got in and I saw something was wrong with him. I called the veterinarian. It turned out the poisoned him, and we couldn't save him. He died that day. Was Johnny still working there when the animals were moved to the Safari? No. Johnny went into early retirement. When he was almost 80, he went back to Germany for the first time. He wanted to see the university he had attended. He came back very disappointed. He felt his home was here. After two days of persuasion, Paula entered the crate. In a few minutes, the truck will take her to her spacious Safari home. Those opposed to the zoo's evacuation have long since fallen silent. The cash involved in the real estate project to be erected in the zoo's place tipped the scales. The Tel Aviv municipality itself completed the opposition campaign, and was rewarded with a new office building. Only now do I get it. The municipal land was given to the association, and then there were shady deals... Someone had to have been corrupt. There must have been corruption there. He was ousted. "Go. Leave." Now... I mean Schornstein. Now, who finally got it? Who profited? I remember hearing about the move in 1980, and I remember they said the animals would have lots of space now. They'd have grassy patches, and a kind of imitation jungle. It sounded good. And I remember feeling really sorry about that zoo. I loved it so much. Experts, and even zoo employees, say this is a paradise for animals. A little Africa. Spacious paddocks, necessary for many of the animals, who suffered for years in the old zoo, also due to visitor behavior. Here, she's coming out. She's out. That's it. I think it's good that they got them out of there. That zoo was the worst. That zoo was the worst. Each animal had just a few meters. So I was delighted to evacuate that miserable zoo. Zoos aren't just passÃ, they make animals suffer. It's abuse. Animals deserve freedom. We treat them like things. They have souls, just like we do. For god's sake, keeping animals in tiny cages is abuse. For god's sake, keeping animals in tiny cages is abuse. Even in those yards, with the electrified fences. Did you become disillusioned? -Totally. I suddenly realized how absurd zoos were. That it was sadism. So you're saying, zoos were good for those days, but not anymore. They were never good. We didn't realize how bad they were. They taught us how to learn how bad it was for them. Zoos, as an issue? -Yes. They're terrible places, maybe. I have to think about it. I'm of two minds about it, like a double-edged sword. On the other hand, it also brings a lot of joy. Has anyone ever asked the animals? No one ever asked them. They're there. What do you see? A lion lying there, and cursing the day it was born, maybe. It just can't write it. Now it's starting to get sad. I enjoyed them very much. Do you know what we used to have? Nothing... That's all we had here. We had a zoo...see look at it, we had a zoo. But instead, to put a tower!? Who lives in this tower? I suppose that the people who live here are merchants or bankers. Insurance people. Lawyers. Not your average people. And they're in cages, as well. Each one in his own little cage. Today it is towers, tomorrow it will be ruins... I don't know what it will turn to be, maybe animal cages. It's finished. This isn't Tel Aviv. It's something else. Protect the cultural spirit of the city of Tel Aviv This city is not made of its houses, its streets, and its buidings, but rather, the people, the language, the love of work and creation, the equality, the freedom, our selfreliance and the urge to live a decent independent life Safeguard these values, because the future of our city depends on it. Long live the Jewish genius! Long live the city of Tel Aviv!
