[music continues] [glass shattering] [dramatic music] Hello, police? This is 652 East, 86th Street. Something terrible has happened. Car 98, Car 98 emergency call at 652 East, 86th Street. [music continues] Alright, what happened? Oh, officer, I'm glad you're here. I'm so glad you're here. - Well? - Look. - Did you see who did it? - Oh, yes, sir. Yes, sir, indeed, I did. And I'll always remember that face. What did he look like? He was big and ugly, and he had a scar over one eye. I think it was the left one. Yes, uh, it was the left one. You think you could identify him if you saw him again? Oh, absolutely. I'll never forget that face. [telephone ringing] - Yeah. - 'Walt, listen.' (male #1 on phone) 'They just picked up Caesar an hour ago.' 'They're holding him on suspicion of murder.' - Murder? - 'Yeah.' 'I want you to get him out on bail or habeas corpus' 'or something.' At this hour? Let him cool off a bit. I can't do anything until the morning, anyhow. 'Listen, Walt, this is important.' 'Come over here right away.' 'I tell you, you've got to spring him.' 'You understand? You've got to spring him.' 'Walt?' Alright, Hap, alright. Give me 20 minutes. [doorbell buzzes] Get it. (Hap) 'About time. What kept you?' It's a little out of my line, isn't it, Hap? I thought my job was acting as legitimate attorney for the Richie Syndicate. Not springing punch-drunk killers who go around shooting people full of holes. Not getting out of bed at 2:30 in the morning. You're my lawyer, you'll do what I tell you. Besides, I didn't say Caesar'd done anything. I just said he got picked up on suspicion. Sure, Walt, they ain't got nothin' on Caesar. Just because some old dame says she thinks she recognizes him from a police photo, that don't make no case. Will you kindly take your legal advice back to the sixth grade? Now, look, Walt, it's just I don't want Caesar in any trouble, that's all. Now you get him out on bail, see? If this isn't enough, well, you can get some more. Stop lookin' so sad. You're supposed to be a smart lawyer, Mr. Colby. This is gonna be easy. And suppose I tell you to jump off the dock with your easy jobs. Alright, maybe Caesar's innocent, I don't know. We'll let the law decide that. But I do know one thing, I'm sick and tired of mixing with these stupid mugs of yours that have sawdust for brains. And that goes for you, too, juvenile delinquent. Take it easy, Walt, take it easy. It's nothing to get excited about. All you need, sweetheart, is a little backbone. Backbone? You know, it's a very funny thing about backbone. You neck is always sticking out one end. Isn't it, Hap? Smart boy. Maybe a little too smart. - Hello, shamus. - Sit down. The dame isn't backing down on the identification. The DA's office wants a case, Caesar. They're holding you without bail. There's nothing you can do about it, so calm down. If you think I'm gonna sit here-- Sittin', standin' or ridin' a bicycle you're licked and you know it. It's about time some of you guys learn we got laws in this country. Yeah, yeah, sure. Come off of it, shamus. I tell ya, I didn't do it. Hap said he was gonna spring me. You tell Hap for me I can talk about a few things he don't want talked about. Well, there's nothing I can do for you tonight, anyway. You know, there's nobody any stronger for you than Hap. I don't know nothin'. You tell him what I told ya. Okay. I'll tell him. [telephone ringing] Okay, answer it. Act sleepy. Hello? - 'Flaxy?' - Yes. I'm sorry to wake you up, darling. (Flaxy) 'What's the matter?' Well, I, I don't wanna talk over the phone. - I, I wanna come over. - Alright. You sound worried or something. Alright, it's up to you, Flaxy. He listens to you. It will be like taking candy from a baby. Don't kid yourself. He's been talking about getting out of this toy mob of yours for a long time. Yeah, I know. Why is he so important to you, Hap? He's not so important but nobody walks out on Hap Richie. Nobody has, nobody's going to. After he gets Caesar off maybe I'll be looking around for somebody else. You're a cute kid, Flaxy. Buy yourself a yacht. Sure. Don't worry about Walt. Just don't draw on the punch, angel. That's what they call telegraphing. [instrumental music] This is wonderful, isn't it? Taking orders from a hoodlum like Hap Richie who was prying open coin machines when I was still struggling with first year Latin. Every time I walk into court with his name on a brief I'm sitting on a keg of dynamite. Now this thing with Caesar. Where do you think you would have started if it hadn't been with Hap Richie? Well, I didn't become an attorney to find loopholes in the law for Hap and his boys to walk through. Look, Flaxy. The only decent thing that's happened to me since I got mixed up with Hap Richie was meeting you. Let's get out now. We'll go to California, China, anywhere. Do you think you can walk out on Hap...just like that? Why not? I'm asking you to marry me and get out of this whole mess. Listen, Walt, I stand up every night and sing my lungs out in front of a bunch of guys who make bad jokes. I don't like that either. I do it because I know it won't last forever. It's the same with you, Walt. Someday you're gonna have a bankroll. We can get married and have the things we want. You haven't got that bankroll yet, Walt. You haven't got enough to throw Hap over. What difference does it make if we love each other? And I love money, too, darling. You can never get anywhere without paying for the ride. Do what Hap tells you. Get Caesar off. There's no actual proof he's guilty. The DA is just trying to make a case. You said so yourself. Make Hap pay. Make him pay you plenty. Then in a few months, we'll go away together. You'll never get anywhere if you don't take chances. - I don't like the odds. - I can help you, darling. I can help you save. It won't take long. Tell me you'll do it. Alright. When it comes right down to it I guess I'd do almost anything for you. Goodnight, sweetheart. Hello, Hap. Yes, he just left me. [chuckles] Sure, everything's gonna be fine. Okay, darling. Goodnight. [instrumental music] Hey, lookin' for somebody? Yeah, Peggy Farrar, if it's alright with you. Well, I guess it's alright. She's in room 202. I know. Money? Sure, I want money. You think I'd be livin' in a dump like this if I didn't? Don't worry about Peggy, Hap. She'll play. Alright, Flaxy. Takin' your word on this dame. We've got a lawyer on this case who has one weakness. He lacks imagination. Alright, what do you want me to say? You were with Caesar Thursday night, understand? When he was picked up, he just left you at the Montreux's Bar. He'd been hanging around with you for three hours. Yeah, but are you sure we can get away with it? That dame who saw Caesar ain't gonna back down. She'll back down when Colby gets through with her. You've never seen this lawyer work when he's convinced he's being honest. It's up to you, baby, to convince him he's honest. I told you not to let that bother you. Okay. Satisfied? That dame will do nothin' but get up in front of that jury and say I'm not sure. She's the only one we have to worry about, Peg. Nobody else got a good look at Caesar's face. It's your word against hers. With your testimony and the Montreux's bartender to back it the DA's case goes blooey. But it won't mean a thing if your story doesn't get across. I'll take care of my end, you take care of yours. I just don't want anything to happen, that's all. We don't either. Come on. Oh, well, Mr. Richie if, uh, I could have a C-note or somethin' while I'm waitin'. Let her have it. - I'll call you when I'm ready. - Fine. You're meetin' my lawyer this afternoon for the kick-off. And, uh, you better stay here, keep briefin' her. We don't wanna take any chances. - Alright, sure. - Oh, uh.. You want a drink or somethin', to success? With me, baby, success is inevitable. You don't have to drink for it. Alright, let's go over it. Oh, yes, sir. I'm tellin' you the truth. Caesar was with me the whole evenin'. Well, we closed the Montreux's Bar together. The bartender will tell you that. [laughing] [dramatic music] [instrumental music] He's coming in now, Mr. Richie. - Who? - Your lawyer, Mr. Colby. - You said I should-- - Oh, yes. Okay. Excuse me. - Hiya, Flaxy. - Hello, Hap. I'll be with you in a minute. Well, what do you say? Well, congratulations. That was a great pitch you gave the jury today. I hope you're satisfied with your boy back in circulation. The DA's office isn't. Oh, I'm bleedin' all over for them guys. Come on, let's get a drink. You don't waste much time, do you, Hap? Double-cross your attorney, put hoodlums back on the street throw a party. Ah, don't be cute. Nobody double-crossed nobody. You had an honest witness. Caesar had nothin' to do with it. That's what I thought. I kept my fingers crossed hoping that this time everything was on the level. - Did you tell him? - Tell me what? I've got a little news for you, Hap. News? What are you talkin' about? I'm talking about the star witness for the defense. Little Peggy. Sweet Peggy Farrar, that on-the-level character you handed me, she came up to my office an hour ago and said that you'd made a deal with her. Uh, well, uh, don't be sour about it, Walt. I had to do it. I had to get Caesar off, and you weren't being very cooperative. And you weren't being very smart. You haven't heard the rest of the story. Now that Caesar's free, she wants to yell copper. She thinks that perjuring herself is worth more than she bargained for. Come on, let's get out of here. Well, I told you to keep out of that cabinet. Okay, spill it. This has been coming to you for a long time. That Farrar dame ever talks what does she figure the law will do to her? Well, you've got a lot more to lose than she has and she knows it. She wants $10,000. She's got just that one thing on her mind like something's jammed her brain. Ten thousand dollars. Okay. Okay, I'll pay her. That won't work. How long do you think that will last? Every time she wants more dough, she'll put the arm on you again. - Then we'll stop her. - I'll stop her, Hap. - Why don't you shut up? - Get out, Roper. If that dame ever talks, you'll take the rap same as me. I'm not even going to give it a chance. I'm walking right into the DA's office the first thing in the morning and clearing my skirts of this whole mess. That's putting me on the spot, isn't it, Walt? Look, Hap, you're gonna have to roll your own hoop. You got into this, now you get out. Get yourself another lawyer. The police in this town have been after little mice like you for a long time. When this is all over, Hap you're gonna be cracked wide open and I'm not helpin' you break the fall. Come on, we're gettin' out of here. You haven't been fired yet, Mr. Colby. What makes you think your contract won't be renewed? I don't want it renewed. I'm leaving. I've been a long time getting to this point but I don't care anymore. This has been like a tough game of poker. You either call or you get out. Well, I'm getting out. Okay. Okay. I'll get your things. Thinks you're peaches and cream, don't he? A sucker for you, huh? He wants me to marry him. You lose this setup, there won't be much between you and the pavements, will there? What do you want me to do, Hap? Well, he's no good for me anymore, Flaxy and I don't want him to be good for anyone else. Like the DA, maybe? Yeah, maybe. You get along home. Get rid of Colby, change your clothes and call me in an hour. You may be going out tonight. Okay. Hello, Caesar? Hiya, kid, Hap Richie. Yeah. I got a little job for ya. Unh-unh, no. This is gonna be an easy one. Very easy. [dramatic music] [man whistling] (Peggy) 'I want out! That's all I want, Flaxy.' - 'I want out.' - 'Shut up.' (Peggy) 'You gotta listen to me. You gotta listen.' 'I ain't gonna do nothin'.' (Flaxy) 'You won't be able to do nothin', can you?' (Peggy) 'Please! Please don't, Flaxy.' [screams] 'Don't hit me again, Flaxy.' 'All I want is out. Flaxy, Flaxy, don't.' - 'You don't listen..' - 'Flaxy, I want out.' Flaxy, don't! Please call Hap. Please call him. No, I don't call Hap. What do I call Hap for? So you can pull a cheap trick like this some other time? I set you up with a grand, but you got greedy. I'm not gonna stand by and see my friends get taken. I will do nothin', honest. I'll shut up and be good. Just tell Hap I don't want the ten grand. I know how guys like Hap work. I tell ya, I was crazy when I.. [knock on door] Okay, open it. Open it! What are you afraid of, Peg? Afraid of Hap? Next time, keep your mouth shut. [knock on door] - Yeah, who is it? - 'It's the clerk.' (male #2) 'What's goin' on in there?' - What do you want? - We don't want no trouble. Shut up. Get out of here. [dramatic music] Call Hap off. I won't squawk. I'll leave town. I won't do nothin' to hurt anybody. You gotta listen to me, Flaxy. You gotta listen. I told you, you talk too much. [intense music] [Peggy screams] - Got a match? - Oh, yes, ma'am. Hey, is everything alright up there? Sure, everything is dandy. Stop worrying about your rotten hotel. [ship horn blaring] Looks like somebody didn't like her. How long you figure she's been dead? Can't tell much until after the autopsy. Maybe four or five hours. Nobody's seen anything, Max. Just reports from the kid who saw the body floating. Peggy Farrar, Hotel Norwood, 9th Avenue. We'll check with you later, doc. Let's go to work, Joe. Alright, alright, what about the dame in here with her yesterday? - What were they fighting about? - Oh, I-I don't know. A-all she kept sayin' was she was scared to death about bein' killed. But if you ask me-- Do you know the dame's name? Yeah.. Oh, sure, sure. I have it right here. Ah, here it is. Uh, "Farrar. Peggy Farrar." The other dame's name, for cryin' out loud. Oh, the other one? Oh, gosh, no. I don't, I don't know what her name is. Uh, oh, this Farrar girl kept callin' her Flaxy all the time. I don't know who she was. Hey, Max. Marriage license. There's her name right there, Flaxy Martin. She was that Farrar girl's witness three years ago. This Flaxy left right after the fight, huh? Oh, yeah, but m-maybe she came back. I-I don't know. I was off an hour. But she could have come back and killed her then. She-she could have hauled her body out of here then. Yeah, she could have been a bus if she had four wheels. Let's get out of here, Joe. Hey, wait a minute. Don't you want my name? Hey, don't you want my name for the papers or something? Of course, they're looking for me. My name's in the paper. I phoned my apartment ten minutes ago. They've got two cops waiting for me now. I'm scared, Walt. Tell me what happened. I was afraid for you, darling. I was afraid of what Hap might do if he found out you crossed him. I-I thought if I went to Peggy and got her to keep her mouth closed you wouldn't have to go to the district attorney. I didn't kill her, Walt. I didn't kill her. I know, darling, I know. What am I going to do? You're going to give yourself up. I'll get you out of this and we'll drag Hap and Caesar and the whole dirty show into it. But what about you? You drag Hap into it, you drag yourself. That's what I tried to prevent by going to Peggy. Supposing you do free me and Hap gets fined and thrown into jail there will always be someone like Caesar waiting for us to get even. Hap always gets even. You know that, Walt. That's just a chance we'll have to take. But I don't wanna take it. I say, leave Hap out of it. Do what you can for me, but leave Hap out. We'll make up a story. Peg and I could have had a fight over lots of things. I don't know if I can get you off on a phony story. There's too much circumstantial evidence against you. But it's better to take that chance than both of us getting shot up some night in a dark alley. Can't you see, darling? We'll never have each other if we don't sacrifice now. I'm willing because I love you. But why? Why should you make the sacrifice? Because the cops think I did it. I'm the only one involved. You saw the papers. 'Since when are you believing in papers?' But, Walt-- As long as the cops have a patsy, it could be anybody. The way the cards are stacked now, I couldn't possibly get you off with less than ten years. But with a lot of work and a little luck I might be able to get myself off. What do you mean? I mean, uh, I killed Peggy Farrar. - 'No.' - I say I did it. There's no evidence that says I didn't. She was blackmailing me, cock-eyed. It had nothing to do with Hap. Nothing to do with you. [doorbell buzzes] Now you'll see a good lawyer at work. I'll be my own defense and I'll get off scot-free. They'll never get a conviction. - How do you know? - Because I do. [doorbell buzzes] Now watch yourself. This will work. Believe me. - Walter Colby? - Yeah. We're looking for a girl by the name of Flaxy Martin. - Oh, yeah? - Mind if we come in? No, not at all. Come in. This is the girl. - Your name's Flaxy Martin? - That's right. Well, you better come along with us. We wanna ask you a couple of questions. That won't be necessary. You got the wrong party. Yes, she had nothing to do with the murder of Peggy Farrar. Here. Come on. - That's what you say, pal? - That's what I say, pal? I killed her. - Come again, Jack. - I say I killed her. Stop standing there like a couple of monkeys. Let's finish this down at headquarters. Come on. Coming, sweetheart? (Max) 'Double-crossing you for what?' What was Farrar double-crossing you for? She was going to the district attorney to tell him that I had paid her to perjure herself. I never paid her a dime. Her old testimony was on the level. It was just a blackmail play of hers and I wouldn't play along with her. Then you killed her, huh? Baloney. Who are you protecting, Colby? Your girl? You're protecting Flaxy Martin. No, I said she was out of this. Look, what's the matter with you guys? I've been sitting here all day and half the night trying to tell you that I killed Peggy Farrar. - What do you want? - The truth! Why did you hit her so many times? I don't know. I was sore, I guess. She hit me and I picked up the pipe. - Nah. - How did you get to the pier? I walked. So you didn't take a taxi, huh? No, you just walked. Who do you think you're kidding? I killed Peggy Farrar in self-defense. She was blackmailing me on a charge that wasn't true. Now, look, boys, that's my statement. - Take him out of here. - Come on. You know, you look tired, dear. It will be so much easier if you believed me. I believe ya. I'm tired enough right now to believe you if you said you killed Peter Rabbit. That's my boy. Do you wanna question the girl? No, no, send her home. You're free to go, miss. [instrumental music] Your witness, Mr. McClane. Mr. Colby, you've testified that the deceased attacked you on the Crescent Steamship Line Docks on the evening of April, the 11th after you'd ignored her demand for blackmail? Yes, sir. (McClane) 'And that as you turned from the deceased' 'to walk away, she struck at you from behind.' Yes, sir. You're quite sure, Mr. Colby that as you turned from the deceased she struck at you first? And in the ensuing struggle you accidentally killed her? Yes, sir. I've already said that. That's all, Mr. Colby. Thank you. The prosecution calls Fred Banford. (male #3) 'Fred Banford, take the stand.' 'Raise your right hand.' 'You solemnly swear the testimony you're about to give' 'in this case will be the truth, the whole truth' 'and nothing but the truth, so help you God?' - I do. - Sit down. State your name, please. Fred Banford. Mr. Banford, as cab driver for the Greater New York Transportation Company do you recall driving a customer to the Crescent Steamship Line Docks on the evening of April, the 11th of this year? I do. And could you identify the customer? Yes, sir. Will the defendant, please, rise? 'Is that the man?' Is that the man, Mr. Banford? Yeah. Yeah, that's him. You positively identify the defendant Walter Colby as the man who got out of your cab on the Crescent Steamship Line Docks on April, the 11th of this year? Yes, sir. What happened after that? He said he'd be about an hour, for me to come back. I, uh, went to a, a place for a cup of coffee. Before I went in, I, like I always do I, I checked the backseat for anything a customer might, may be dropped. I found a wallet in the back. It was layin' on the floor. Is that the wallet? Yeah. Yeah, that's it. Continue, please. Well, I, I opened the wallet uh, looking for identification and I seen a snapshot of this guy 'the one I just left off' 'so beat it right back where I left him' 'thinking that maybe he might be needing it or something.' (McClane) 'What happened after you arrived at the dock?' I just kind of started looking around. Then I came on the two of them. This guy and a dame. - They was arguing. - About what? Oh, all I remember, he says.. He says, "I'll kill you if you make a move." 'And she says somethin' about going to the DA' 'and spillin' everything she knew.' And she, uh, busted away from him and started off. I seen him pick up a, a.. I don't know, a piece of pipe or somethin' and, and grab her. 'And he swung around and hit her.' 'He was still hittin' her when I run.' That's a lie! That's a lie! [gavel banging] [indistinct chatter] [dramatic music] Your witness, Mr. Colby. No questions. No questions. Colby, DA's office here to see you. Hello, Colby. Why are you playing hard to get? Just because you caught a conviction still doesn't mean you can't tell the truth. What truth? Why did you suddenly clam up after the cab driver's testimony? Who are you protecting? Hap Richie? Or that Martin girl? Why don't you go away? Oh, it's going to be tough. They're gonna throw the book at you. Get out! I said get out! [piano music] [sighs] [upbeat piano music] Well, that's my kind of music, Flaxy. Keep it up. [somber music] (Hap) 'Hi, sweetheart.' Twenty years, they gave him. Twenty years. 'Some joke, huh?' Oh, come on, Flaxy. Ain't you gonna play some more? Lay off. This thing's not bothering you, is it? Of course not. Why should it bother me? Wasn't it a laugh the way quoted me in the papers? Yeah, waiting at the gates for the man you love. Ah, you were in there pitching all the way, honey. I wasn't taking any chances of him changing his mind. Ah, you're great, baby. Really great. Let's talk about you, darling. Who is it this time? Another one of those guys from the DA's office? I don't know, pal, I don't know. I just work here. What's the matter, Walt? You don't know me? Sure, sure, I know you. You're Sam Malko. You run a garage down on Colin Street. Goin' away tonight, huh? What's on your mind? I ain't forgot what you did for Florence and the kids. You might have forgotten it, Walt, but I haven't. You took care of them till I got that parole. It's hard to believe that stuff in the paper about you killin' anybody. Get to it, Sam. I'm worried, Walt, about somethin' I heard. A guy named Caesar's laughin' at you. Yeah, laughin'. He's got a habit of bendin' his elbow too much and shootin' his mouth off. Right now, he's braggin' about you takin' a rap for him. I ain't asking any questions. What you do is your own business. You're a smart guy. But maybe this time, you're taking a rap for something you didn't do. And I see your girl, Flaxy Martin always with Hap Richie. What about her? They come in my garage for gas. Don't always look good. Don't make much sense, does it, Walt? If she's hanging around with Hap Richie she ought to know what I'm tellin' you about Caesar. Why ain't she here instead of me? What she's stayin' clammed up about? Come on, let's go. Don't make much sense, does it, Walt? [train chugging] [train horn blaring] It's just like I said, Mr. Colby. They found his carload of booze where he left it. But the only proof they had that this guy was driving was the eyewitness testimony of his two cousins. [chuckles] I'm not borin' you, am I, Mr. Colby? No, no. Say, uh, you wouldn't like a chocolate-covered cherry, would you? - No. No, thanks. - Okay. 'Well, there was nothing nobody could do about it.' 'First cousin was dead, and the other cousin' 'was afraid to talk.' 'What that case needed was a smart lawyer' 'like you, Mr. Colby.' Sure. Sure. Look, how about a little stretch? I'm all knotted up. Oh, we'd better sit right here. - We haven't got far to go. - What's the matter? You're not afraid I'd do something foolish, are you? It wouldn't do you no good. I'm too smart to carry the keys to these handcuffs on me. Well, in that event, you don't mind, uh getting a little air, do you? I guess not. Let's go. Would you like a cigarette? I'd rather have a little air. Okay. [train horn blaring] [dramatic music] [music continues] [tires screeching] [dramatic music] (female #1) 'Well, good morning.' No name, no address, no nothing. 'I nearly ran over you. You know that, don't you?' How did I get here? Well, one minute you were alright, the next you weren't. Luckily, you were conscious enough so that I could manage but that's all that matters, isn't it? Well, I.. Oh! Oh, you better stay where you are. Here. And drink this. What is all this? Me and Florence Nightingale. I should have taken you to the police. Only.. '...how do I know they are looking for you.' You don't? Perhaps I should have left you on the road. That would have been alright with me. Would it? Well, that was a quick recovery. How do you feel? Obviously better. I don't get it. - What don't you get? - Who are you? Do you just go around pickin' up bodies off the highway? No, last night was my first time. My name's Nora Carson. What's yours? Let's skip the formalities. Very well. I guess you wanna know why I helped you. Well, let's just say it's because I'm a sucker. I happen to feel sorry for anyone who runs away from something. I know what it is to run away. Who are you, anyway? What are you trying to sell? You've got it wrong, mister. Everything in this life doesn't have a price tag. I work in the public library. Last year, I was elevator operator in Seattle. Next Tuesday, I might be washing dishes in Chicago. Speaking of work, I better get there. It's almost noon. If you'd care to stay and rest, I'll be home about 8:30. There's plenty of food in the icebox. No, thanks. I'll-I'll be running along. I always thought that running away was better at night. I'll take my chances. [instrumental music] [instrumental music] [music continues] [sizzling] [music continues] I decided to take your advice. So I see. Hungry? Oh, I guess I better beat it. You'll get awfully hungry tonight. You can't just walk into a restaurant and order a steak. Not you. Not with this story on page one. Well, what do you say, Walter Colby? Have some dinner? [sighs] All the roads are blocked and the sheriff's office is looking for you if you're interested. Why wouldn't I be interested? Last night I was sorry for you. Tonight I don't know what to be. - What are you sore at me for? - I'm not sore at you. I'm sore at the world in general. [door opens] Oh, excuse me, I-I didn't know you had company. 'I-I just came to ask if I could borrow a couple of eggs.' 'I h-have to boil them for my husband's lunch tomorrow.' Of course, I'll get them for you. - You sure you can spare them? - I have plenty. I do hope you didn't mind my butting in this way just when you and your, uh.. ...your gentleman friend are having dinner. Not at all. You think she suspected anything? I don't know. Thanks for the dinner. According to the newspapers, the district attorney's office had a hunch you were innocent. You were taking the blame for somebody else. Don't believe everything you read in the papers. You can leave whenever you want to. I'm sorry. You should have turned me in last night. I don't think I'd turn anybody in. At least not without knowing a lot more about them than I know about you. Maybe you're innocent. Maybe the other guy's wrong. Well, if I'm wrong, I'm gonna find it out. But if I'm right, I'm gonna find that out too. Find out about what? If I was sucker for a dame who took me to the moon. Isn't there an easier way of finding out than running away from the police? Unh-unh. Well, there are a couple of people I gotta see all by myself. Without any interference from anybody. The police or anybody else. [dramatic music] [doorbell rings] Evening. You're the lady that called the sheriff's office? Uh, there won't be any trouble, will there? I certainly wouldn't want to make any trouble for anybody. You know, she's a really nice person and I wouldn't, for the life of me-- Just a minute. Just a minute Where is this fellow? Right next door. Uh, he's in there now. I've kept my eye on the house. The paper said they wanted everybody to be on the lookout and I got to thinking that he certainly fit the description-- We've got 50 guys fitting the description. The whole town thinks they've seen him. Say, but.. You won't say I said anything, will you? - Do you mind if I take these? - Not at all. Take these too. You'll be needing it. That isn't necessary. You'll be needing a lot of things. Mostly luck. [doorbell buzzes] You better answer it. [dramatic music] - Mind if I come in, miss? - What's the matter? Just had a report you're having dinner with a stranger. We're checkin' everything. I guess you read the papers. Yes. Uh, oh, oh, that was my brother. He just arrived today. Do you mind if I see your brother? Yeah, let's all have a look at your brother. Well, if it isn't sixth grade. Always surprises, ain't there, shamus? Get over there. Well, I see you've been promoted again from newsboy to bodyguard to professional killer. You've been pretty loose with your big talk, ain't you? Well, I ain't takin' it no more. Don't you think you can get away with this. Shut up. Lock 'em together. Go on! Come on, hurry up! Now get over here. You and your comedy cops. Every time you got a call on some guy that looks suspicious I just followed you. Open that door. 'Go ahead, open it!' Get in there, grandad. Pleasant dreams. Maybe you're smarter than I gave you credit for. Sure. I'm a big boy now. What's up? You didn't make no break because you was lonely. You heard somethin'. You're lookin' for somebody. Who is it? It wouldn't be Caesar, would it, shamus? You're the genius. Maybe you can find that out too. I'll find out. You and me is gonna take a little ride. And as for you, sister, you can keep him company.. ...just so there won't be no more squawks to the cops. Go ahead. [dramatic music] You shoot me and you're through. The cops will want to know who killed me and why? You know they're apt to link the whole thing right back to you and Hap Richie. Why don't you call Hap over? You don't wanna gum up the works. Go ahead, genius. Call him up. You don't wanna be demoted, do you? I ain't gonna call Hap. Why bother him? You want me to make a mistake, don't you? Like parking the car, calling Hap getting picked up maybe. That's what you want, ain't it, shamus? What do you think I've got? Scrambled eggs for brains? I'm another Caesar? How far do you think you're going to get with this? They have all the roads blocked. Not the way I came in, sister. Get the trees behind us, Charlie. [intense music] It's funny, isn't it? I've always had a dread of being buried. You're not going to be buried. How can we get out of it with these on? And that killer standing down there staring at us like a madman. "Always bury the evidence," that's what they say don't they, shamus? Now they don't find you. Maybe they'll never find you. They'll think you escaped, you and the dame. Like you said, it don't start no investigation. Go on, stop loafing. We ain't got all day. Dig! Life can be very sweet especially when it's almost over with. It's not over with. Not yet. Ain't this deep enough? Look at my hands. Look at 'em! What do I care about your hands? 'You've got any prayers to say, you better start saying them.' Okay. Alright. Come on down. [dramatic music] Some campfire boy I got here. He can't even dig a hole without bellyachin' like an old woman. [grunting] [intense music] I hate taking you with me this way. It's alright. I think I would have come, anyway. You're asking for more trouble. It doesn't matter anymore. We're living on borrowed time. Borrowed until I can pay it back with interest. What do you mean, pay it back? I've gotta see a man named Caesar. He's the only man who can clear me. I have to see him before Hap does. Watch the road. That's the main highway up ahead. We've got to take it or we'll never get back to the city. Go ahead, take it. What about the roadblocks? You were talking about all those jobs you'd had. Ever did any acting? Lead in two high school plays. Well, that's good, because today is your big break and it leads right straight to Broadway. - Well, how are you doing? - Just great. We've stopped 3000 cars, nabbed 18 drunks six guys carrying slot machines, but no Walter Colby. This is it. Are you frightened? - Not very. - Alright. Keep your right hand covered and don't forget your accent. Officer! Officer! - Yes, miss? - We've just seen him. - Who? - Colby, of course. Alright, miss, where? Where? - How long ago? - Back at Five Corners. We were sittin' in the station gettin' gas when this man we know as Colby drove in. How did you know it was Colby? Well, because he-he was quite tall 'he had brown hair, brown eyes, and a mustache.' You better hurry, officer. How did you know Colby's description so well? Well, because we-we heard it on the radio. We were laughing at how the description fit Charlie. Charlie? Who's Charlie? Oh, officer, this is Charlie. (Walter) 'Officer, my girlfriend's a little excited' 'but if I were you I would investigate.' 'The man did look suspicious.' Okay, we'll take a look. Take Spencer and be at Five Corners. Well, uh, aren't you even goin' yourself? Now, honey, the chief knows what he's doin'. If that guy was Colby, then they'll catch him. [chuckles] Wait a minute. Say, what did you say your name was? - Charlie. - Let's see some identification. [siren wailing] Okay. Yeah, I see it now. You know, you do look a little like that guy Colby. [chuckles] Well, I always said Charlie had a shifty eye. [all laughing] It's alright if we go on now, isn't it, officer? Oh, sure. Sure, you're not smuggling no criminals. [chuckles] Just Charlie. - Goodbye. I hope you catch him. - We'll get him. A nice young couple. Phew. You and me both. [exhales] This is Sam Malko's garage. He lives at a little place in the back. You can stay here with him and wait for me. What about these? Well, I'm hoping he can help us. [knocks] - Walt, what are you doin' here? - Cut the emotions, Sam. Let us in. Take these off, will you, Sam? Come on. Come on over here. I read about your escape in the paper. Heard it over the radio too. But I didn't hear anything about the young lady. Sam, this is Nora Carson. Well, get us out of these, will you, please? If it will ease your conscience any, it wasn't the police that tied us together. I can clip the chain with these, but it will take a little while to get the bracelets off. Well, never mind that now. There. Feel like I just dropped 20 pounds. Come on in here. I'll make a pot of coffee. We won't be able to sleep, anyway. Sam, do me one more favor, will you? Take care of Nora. I've got to go find Caesar. Walt. Don't worry. I'm afraid. It will be alright. I'll be back. I better get that car off the street. [dramatic music] - Hello, Caesar. - 'Yeah, who is this?' Well, you don't know me. My name's Elliot. I got a message from a friend of yours. - 'Who?' - Samuel Morison. He asked me to see you when I got out. 'What about?' Well, it's kind of confidential. I, I ought to come over. 'Alright, but make it quick. I'm goin' out.' 'You know where to come?' Yeah. Yeah, he told me. [dramatic music] [music continues] [record player whirring] Caesar. Caesar? [whirring stops] [telephone ringing] (Roper) 'Hello, shamus.' 'What's the matter? You surprised?' 'I'm waiting for ya, shamus.' 'Come on down, baby.' 'And don't try to get out the backdoor.' [laughs] [dramatic music] [music continues] [music continues] [intense music] [gunshot] [gunshot] [music continues] (male #4) 'Hold it.' Come here. What are you doin' in here? I'm just looking for a shortcut home. Yeah? Well, that's the way out. Thanks. [dramatic music] [horn blaring] Well, you're getting on or not? (male #5) 'End of the line, folks. This is it.' Where can I get a cab? There's a phone right over there. [dramatic music] [music continues] [intense music] [gunshot] [gunshot] [gunshot] [gun clatters] George, what is it? What's going on? I don't know. I heard a shot. [laughs] Here I come, baby. [dramatic music] Who's going on the roof? I hate to do this, shamus. You are such a smart guy. [intense music] [gun clicks] [clicks] [grunting] [groans] [grunting] Get up. [grunting] [intense music] - What's happening up here? - Somebody call the police. Nothing's happened. Nothing's happened. Remember that. Get out of the way. Look out. Look out. Look out, George. Look out, he's got a gun. [instrumental music] [telephone ringing] Hello. Hap, I've been trying to get you for a half an hour. I heard about Caesar and Roper down at the club. I'm frightened. What am I going to do? Take it easy, take it easy. What are you frightened about? - You're getting protection. - Protection? What kind of protection are you giving me? I'm getting out of here. I'm getting out of town. Calm down. I'll come right over. I'm leaving the club right now. (Walter) You're not goin' anywhere, sweetheart. Yeah, I got back just a little bit sooner than I expected. What do you think you were getting away with? You-you think I framed you, don't you? Sure. Sure, I framed you. I-I framed myself at the same time. I knew Caesar killed Peg, but I had to lie to you. Well, you lied beautifully. Beautifully. Listen to me. I don't know if I can convince you or not. I guess it doesn't matter anymore. You hate me so. But you've got to believe this. Hap's been trying to get me away from you for a long time. 'You didn't know that, did you?' What else didn't I know? 'When you tried to walk out on him' 'he was going to kill you.' Everything I did was for one reason. - Because I loved you. - Go on. I told Hap not to kill you. Sending you up was just as good. I knew it would be rotten, but I wanted you to live. I hoped that someday you'll be free and we'll be together. It was all I could figure out. I just didn't get away with it. Oh, Walt. Walt, it isn't too late. We can still go away. I'll go any place with you. You mean you'd give all this up for me? I thought money was your first love. Alright. As long as we're in it this far, let's go a step further. - What do you mean? - Hap. What about him? He's on his way here from the Domino Club. He'll have the club cash with him. Forty grand. He ought to pay us something for what he's done to us. What do you say? To success. You know, Hap's not gonna like this. He's gonna be a little peeved at you. Sure you want to go through with it? [knock on door] Well, what do you know? Hello, Hap. Come in. Have a drink. I always say it's tough when you have to double-cross your best friend. I always say if you lie down with dogs you get up with fleas. - 'Take his wallet.' - Never mind. This isn't gonna get you any place, Flaxy. Let me worry about that. Go on, toss it. Where are you going? Get back. Get 'em up! You didn't really think I was going with you? No, not knowing you as I do. She's a great kid. You can always trust her to double-cross you. - What's the pitch? - You're no good to me anymore. When Walt gets picked up, he sings and you get it. I get it, too, if I stick around. Well, I'm not going to jail for anybody. Not just yet, sweetheart. Not yet. You couldn't hit the side of a barn with a bucket of birdshot. Don't try me. You double-crossed yourself this time, didn't you, Flaxy? Just like I thought you would. You know, if you shoot me, you're going to have Hap on your back before you can turn around. Shoot Hap and the same thing. You got me. You're going to have to shoot both of us before you can even get out of that door and then you'll have the police. Oh, you fixed yourself up good, didn't you, Flaxy? Okay, okay, you take the dough and let me scram. We forget about the whole thing. And who's gonna be patsy for the killing of Peggy Farrar? Me? Unh-unh. [heavy breathing] - Where do we stand, Hap? - Oh, you know where we stand. We toss her in, huh, Walt? We make a bargain. The cops will believe it. They never believed you, anyway. She was their first suspect. Sure. Anything for a joke. Get away from me. Get away from me! [gunshots] [dramatic music] [screams] Drop it. Get the police department, please. (male #6) '47 Precinct.' This is 621, Sutton Place, Apartment B. 'Who's this talking?' Somebody's just killed Hap Richie. You better send somebody over, sergeant. - 'Who is this?' - '621, Sutton Place.' (Walter) 'Apartment B.' I said you could have the dough. Let me out. I'm taking the dough and the police are takin' you. You and I are gonna have a little wait. The last wait we're ever gonna have together. [dramatic music] [siren wailing] What do you think this will get you? You'll end up poor but honest. Only worse. You don't think they'll ever let you practice law in this town. Not after your record. Since when did you get so concerned about my welfare? [siren wailing] Well, that's it, sweetheart. Happy landing. [bangs on door] Let me out of here! Walt! Walt! [sobbing] [knock on door] (male #7) 'Open up! Police!' 'Open up in there.' Alright, get up. [sobbing] Come on, take this. It's good for the butterflies. He told you not to worry silly, didn't he? Go ahead and worry. Where is he? That's what I wanna know. Where is he? How long can you keep waiting? Sometime you wait a lifetime and then it doesn't happen. Oh, where did he go, Sam? Tell me. It won't do any good. Believe me, Nora. I told you before. Oh! - Oh, Walt. - It's alright, darling. (Sam) 'What happened?' You'll read about it tomorrow, Sam. Look, we're pulling out of here. I'm not going to the police. - No. - Stop shaking your head. I'm getting out and you're coming with me. - I'm not going, Walt. - Why? Because you're running away and nobody ever ran away and had anything but bad dreams. I've had enough of 'em. Forty thousand dollars can buy a lot of good dreams. Yeah, that's what I've got. $40,000. It's Hap Richie's money, but he won't be needing it. Oh, Walt. That's not smart money. Suppose I gave myself up and returned the $40,000, what then? Suppose I manage to clear myself of the murder charge they'd still send me up for two years for perjury. Then where will I be when I got out? Broke, no job, no nothing. - Unh-unh, not me. - We can start all over. - Two years isn't a lifetime. - Now, listen to me. We'll take the car as far as Chicago and ditch it there. We'll watch our step, keep out of sight. Take out easy stages all the way to the coast. That's one tour you can take alone, my dear. I'm taking the next bus right back to where I started. You see, I know now that you really don't need me. You only want me. If you needed me, you'd feel that nothing was too tough to face. No. I'm a girl that believes in a happy ending. Running away seems to suit us both. [instrumental music] You think you ought to let her go like that? I don't need her. I don't need anybody. With 40 grand in your pockets, you can get far enough away and let somebody else take the heartaches. Is that it, Walt? You made one mistake though. You shouldn't have told her which way you were goin'. That girl loves you, Walt. She's liable to help you in spite of yourself because she knows what's good for you. 'She might turn you in.' It could work the other way, couldn't it, Sam? I mean, if a girl loves me, she could send them in the wrong direction and I could get away without any trouble at all. Could be. You know, Sam, I've got $40,000 but what I really need is a nickel. Police Department. Look, if you guys wanna get Walter Colby you better pick up a girl in the bus station in about ten minutes. Her name's Nora Carson. She's 5'6" tall, has brown hair blue eyes, and is wearing a striped blue jacket. Alright, gentlemen, thanks for the pick-up service. - What did you do? - Hey, who are you? - Guess who. - Colby. - Don't try nothin'. - Lay off. Walt? Come on, let's get this over with. Alright, so I'm a sucker for a girl who wants a happy ending. [instrumental music]
