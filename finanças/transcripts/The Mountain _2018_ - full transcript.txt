Mom... Dad won't let me visit. He says you don't want to see me right now. I don't believe him. I miss you. Can I tell you about my dream? You have already started. There were these two people... ...a man... ...and a woman. And they were grabbing at each other. And... I couldn't... I couldn't tell the difference... ...between the two of them. You know, when you were young, I thought you would never stop growing. Look at you now. Like your mother. It's okay. - Okay, ready? - Yeah. One, two, three. - Here we go. - Okay. ♪ Oh, give me a home ♪ ♪ Where the buffalo roam ♪ ♪ Where the deer and the antelope play ♪ ♪ Where seldom is heard ♪ ♪ A discouraging word ♪ ♪ And the skies are not cloudy all day ♪ ♪ Home ♪ ♪ Home on the range ♪ ♪ Where the deer and the antelope play ♪ ♪ Where seldom is heard ♪ ♪ A discouraging word ♪ ♪ And the skies are not cloudy all day ♪♪ I'm so sorry about your dad. Too bad about the rain. You need a hand bringing this stuff in? - I got it. - All right. How much for the pipe? Ten cents. I knew your dad. I'm Dr. Fiennes. You can call me Wallace. Or Wally. That's what the girls call me. I was one of your mother's... physicians. How much for that? What is it, anyway? It's a planchette. It's French for "little plank." It's an old parlor game. People used to think that spirits talked through it. Go ahead, put your fingers on it. Can I go see her? Can't do that. Or what I mean to say is that... I don't work there anymore. So... I can't get you access to her. But I'm sure... I'm sure she's comfortable there. I'm about to go out on the road for a bit. You know what I could use? Somebody to give me a hand carrying stuff... ...and taking photos. Okay. There we go. Oh! "You will see the great pyramids of Egypt." That would be kind of nice. What's it say? What's it say? That's the Polaroid Land Camera. Pop that... Pop that button. There you go. Then take a look at the insides. An aperture, aperture is the mechanical opening behind the lens. And if you were to close that thing down to... let's say f/11... ...you'd be shutting out a lot of light. ♪ Did you ever really love me? ♪ ♪ Did you ever really care? ♪ ♪ Did you ever really miss me? ♪ ♪ Kiss me ♪ ♪ I wonder if your heart was ever there ♪ ♪ Did you ever dream about me? ♪ ♪ Did you ever really cry? ♪ ♪ Did you ever really love me? ♪ ♪ Or did you really tell a lie? ♪♪ Andy?

I don't know where they are. Get your camera. Take your time. Take your time. Thank you, Andy. Is that what you did to my mother? Nice part of the world you got around here. In some instances... ...the best... ...the best that can be done for the family... is to return the patient to them in an innocuous state. I-N-N... O-C... U-O-U-S. So you wanna do like this... and like this, and sometimes the nose will swell. So... there's that. I see a little discoloration here. And you want to account for that. Now, the family... often sees the patient in this condition shortly after the procedure, before healing and swelling has gone down. We help them. And then we take their picture. Okay? Have a seat. Here we go. Okay, okay. Did it go down? Did I knock it down? Well, sometimes it goes down just like that. Come here. Come here. A Tom Collins for the young photographer there. Okay. Here we go.

I'm curious if you have any thoughts on Chlorpromazine. The new drug. The FDA has just approved it? - I know about it. - A lot of people say it's a more humane variation of the procedure you perform. Do they? A lot of people say? The approach that best benefits the hospital, the institutions, the patients, and the patients' families, that's gonna be the one that's gonna stay with us. Why are they screaming? Does it work? Is it dangerous? Are you waiting? When I left home, it was last winter. Last time I saw my boy, he was in the snow. I told him to come inside. You know? He was... just stood there, shivering. What did you do? I picked him up and brought him in. Goddamn it. Give me a towel. Goddamn it. Get her off the fucking table. All right, put her on the gurney. Okay. Carefully. - But quickly. - One, two, three. Let's go, let's go. Let's do another. Thank you. Hello? Hello? Can we speak to my mother? It worked for me before. Yeah, well... Yeah.

He was the first American surgeon to remove a brain tumor. It's absolutely true. He did it... with his fingers. I'm not kidding. And this is before the advent of X-rays. And he did it in an operating theater without electric light. He's still alive. Can you imagine? My grandfather. And you know what? That's him right there. Grandpa. Grampy? Grampy? Oh, Grampy. Oh, it's so sad. He's still got to work. Okay. You never introduced yourself, I mean, by name. I didn't? What the heck is the matter with me? I blame you entirely. This is Andy. Andy here is a fine portrait photographer. - So I hear. - He's so good, in fact, that he could make you look... more beautiful than you already are. And what do you do? Don't tell me you're that man's son. No, I'm not. Why do you hang around with him then? He knows my mother. Ah. Mother's friend. They're not friends. Where's your mother now? In the hospital. What kind of hospital? A state hospital. Hey... my daughter's in the hospital too. She got that from her father. I have it too, but... I have the guts to live with it in the world, and her daddy has no fucking guts at all. Have you ever been touched by a woman? I mean besides your mother when you were a baby? So where to next? What?

I've seen you in the magazines. What's, uh, what's your name? Jack. I need your service. All right. Okay, hold on. Hi. Excuse me. You look like somebody who should know. Since we've been here... I'm sorry. The Board has sided with the opinion that it should be discontinued, or at least weighed against other options like Chlorpromazine. Then, um, why the invitation? Pardon me? I said why the invitation? You invited me. - You invited me... - No, I don't think we did. I don't understand. Why don't you try St. Jude's Hospital? They may be more open to it. Here you go. Do you hear voices? I wouldn't call them that. Okay. If you wouldn't call them voices, what would you call them? Sounds. And what do they say? I already told you they don't say anything. I apologize. What sounds do they make? They sound like that. Or like this. Can you smile? Just gonna ask you some more questions. How long were you institutionalized? Have you received electroshock therapy before? I've met your mother. Hello. We're ready. There you go. I'm going to take you down. Ready, one, two... You're gonna go down on the table. And... down.

I've made an arrangement with that man. Susan's father. Remember that man? You're gonna rest up here today... and then tomorrow morning I'm gonna take you over to his house. More comfortable there. Andy? You've cleared the hurdle. So go on in. And, uh... I'll see you in a second. Let's go! Okay. Close your eyes. Let's breathe. Let it out of the body. And... into the body.
