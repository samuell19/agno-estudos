the big cattle spreads had spring and fall roundups. Then the steers to be sold became a trail herd, pointed for the nearest railhead, often hundreds of miles away. The trail was sometimes tough with rain, wind, and snow. [cows mooing] And sometimes pleasant with good sunlight. It was that way with the outfit we worked for, my younger brother and I. When we reached the railhead town we put on a rodeo for fun, to make a few bets. [cowboy] Ready? [crowd cheers] [horse neighs] [crowd chatters] [crowd cheers] All right, turn him out. [crowd cheers] [crowd laughs] Hey, what's matter, bud? You let crow bait like that throw you? Listen, up in our outfit we wouldn't let a dog like that even pull a wagon. Shoofly ain't never been rode, and I figure ain't any of you man enough to do it. Anybody thinks he can, put your money up where your mouth is. Well now, this is the sort of thing that makes me glad I'm here instead of someplace else. I got $200 here that says I can ride that horse. That is if Mr. Kraft can count up to ten seconds. You do a lot of popping off, don't you? I can count. You sure you can ride? Well, this says I can. Cover it. You've over-matched yourself again, kid. You can't ride that horse. You just stick around and get surprised. [crowd chatters] All right, boys, you want in on this. Let's see your money. [man] Twenty dollars for me. [man 2] Get your money up. - [man 3] I'll take ten. - [Kraft] Ten? [man] Just ten. [Kraft] Ten there then. [man] Here's ten. [man 2] I pick. Okay, turn him loose! [horse neighs] [crowd yells] [crowd laughs] No bet, no bet! It wasn't a fair ride! Go ahead and scream. See how far that'll get ya! I never got a fair chance. I caught my spur on the chute gate. - I get a re-ride. - That was a legal ride, boys. Fair and legal, he loses. [crowd murmurs] Take it easy. You were swindled, but forget it. I don't forget that easy! [grunts] I'll kill him, I'll kill him! Better get him to a doctor, be careful of him. Hurry! What happened here? Sam Mayhew claimed he got cheated in a ride, and hit him. You again, eh? Well, let's go. [door squeaks] No use arguing about it. I got a big bellyful of your little brother. He's a wild one. Every time he hits town, it's the same old story, trouble. This time he was right. He hooked his foot in the chute. - You saw him, same as I did. - I don't care. Your brother's just gotta stop beatin' up on everybody he don't agree with. Kraft isn't hurt bad. A little bump on the head. He'll be good as new in a month. And that's just the length of time your little brother's gonna spend in the pokey cooling off. How 'bout you, Lawyer Crump? You could help the kid if you wanted to. I wouldn't touch that boy with a ten-foot pole. I have to live here. But it was only a little slugging match. Nothing to put a man in jail for a month. Exactly where he belongs. Psst, psst, psst. I don't know if this'll work or not, but I have to take a chance. - Tie it to the bed. - What do you figure? This wall's as soft as it looks. Hurry up. [bed squeaks] Ready. There's a clump of bushes about 50 yards out. Your horse is there, stand back. [metal clanks] Get the key, get the key. How come you have to keep this thing locked? - [wind howling] - [narrator] We kept going until we crossed the border into New Mexico. I knew Sheriff Deadrick's reputation. He had a long arm. It's a nice little town, Bill. My name is Steve, remember? Steve Webster, and yours is Tom Blackwood. I don't see why changing our names means so much. The difference of staying out of jail or not. Breaking you out was a crime. All right, all right. You reckon he's in town? I don't know, I hope so. I'd like to settle down someplace. I'm tired of having to change towns every time you start something. Look, Bill... Steve. I told you, I'm cured. [chuckles] All right, you're cured. Hey, could you tell me where I'd find Ben Murdock? - You looking for work? - That's right. They told us at his ranch he was here in town. Over in the saloon. Well, that's mighty thoughtful of him. We can cut our thirst at the same time. We'll do that after we got the job. - You mind the horses. - Oh, wait a minute. You heard me. [man] I was at Stone's River, cooked with the Twelfth Indians. I wasn't at the battle of Shiloh. Well, I was at Shiloh, but that wasn't no battle. Battle's when two sides fight. There was only one side at Shiloh. Them rebels didn't fight. Which one of you gentlemen is Mr. Murdock? I am. We hear you're looking for hands. - We? - My... partner and myself. - What outfit you with last? - No outfit particular. We've been working around Abilene. You looking for a place to fill your belly, or a place to work? Place to work, sir. Place to settle down. - Are you troublemakers? - No. Pays 30 a month and found. If you're interested get on out to the ranch. - Thanks, Mr. Murdock. - Yeah. Got the job, both of us, 30 a month and found. Thirty a month, that isn't very much. Stop kicking, a job's a job. You saw it, it's a big outfit. - Can I get that drink now? - Go ahead. Fill it up. Shot of whisky, please. We come up on 'em early in the morning. The rebels, they were sleepin'. - They was always sleepin'. [laughs] - Hey, whisky! We jumped 'em and run 'em back into the Mississippi River. [laughs] Them Johnny Rebs ran like yellow turkeys. [laughs] That guy sure loves to flap his big mouth, doesn't he? You referring to me? You're the only one talkin', aren't ya? I happened to be at Shiloh, myself, and the only ones I saw running were the Yankees. You calling me a liar? Well, you had to be to get where you are now. 'Cause you're way past bein' a liar. Look at here, reb. [grunts] Here, get these horses over to the alley. Hurry up! [man] What's goin' on here? This rebel here, has been kicking up a ruckus. Let me have him, constable. I'll show you how we handle rebels where I come from. [grunts] Hey, what's goin' on? What's the matter? Hey, you! [gun fires] They suckered us, boys, they suckered us! Let's get 'em! What happened? Oh, I don't know, some guy talkin' about Shiloh. Large man, big mustache? Yeah. - That was only Murdock. - It was? Well, you never can tell, can ya? I can tell! I can tell right now. You're just a no-good spoiled brat. And I'm fed to the teeth with picking up your chips. You makin' another big brother speech? Nope, I tried to raise you like I thought Dad would. Guess I flunked out. Listen, you've been havin' the time of your life wet-nursin' me all these years. You like to tell people what to do! You and your settlin' down. You and your future. All right, you take that bull-head of yours west and I'll take my future east. One last sermon, if you intend to live by that thing you'll always find a man who can outdraw you. An empty head and a loaded gun are bad partners. I'm still the fastest draw you ever saw. I taught you, remember? And I've known a fair number of real fast drawers, they all got one thing in common, they're all dead. And never draw a gun unless you mean to use it. Good luck. I coulda killed you just now. No, you couldn't. - Can you take care of my horse for the night? - Yes, sir. I want him fed grain and fresh straw in his stall. - All right. - How much will that be? - That'll be two dollars. - Fine. Decent place to eat around here? Best in Denver, Globe Hotel, right there. - Expensive? - It's the right expensive. A dollar for supper and a dollar for a room. - Much obliged. - Sure thing. Much obliged, got a light? Hmm, good dinner. Best steak I've had since I left... left the... Gee I... I can't find my money. Thought I had it in my side pocket. - Something wrong? - Same old game. I'm afraid I've lost my money. [man] Another free-loader, huh? [Bill] No, I had enough to pay for supper. You know how old that line is? You saddle bums are all alike. Why, I've a mind to beat your brains out, you cheap tramp! [grunts] Oh, I'm... I'm sorry. I'm sorry uh... Look, I'll wash the dishes, huh? All right? [Bill hums] Evening. Howdy. I, uh, I saw the fracas. Are you just passing through Denver? Yeah. What do you do next? I'll figure that out tomorrow morning. You got a room? No, but my horse has. I'll tell him to move over. Would you like for me to put you up? Why? I like the way you handle yourself. I like the way you're washing dishes when you didn't have to wash the dishes. That ain't all there is to it. I got a proposition. When you're finished, I'll be waitin' out on the veranda. [Â¶ quiet piano music] - Have a chair. - Thanks. My name's, uh, John Sutton. I'm Bill Mayhew. You like a job? That depends. Good steady work. Fellow wanted to, might make something out of it. Go on. Well, I live in Central City. I run a livery stable up there. With this game leg I don't get around so good anymore. I got some plans. Might take me away from the stable more and more. Like a fellow like you around to help. You got anything against totin' water or heaving grain sacks? No. You too proud to shovel manure? What's the pay? Two dollars a day. I'll feed you and sleep you. You say the job is steady? As steady as you want to make it. I think I'm gonna like working for you, Mr. Sutton. [men chatter] - Welcome home. - Shake hands with Bill Mayhew. - Whipsaw Ellis. - Howdy. - Howdy. - Bill's gonna work for us. Is that a fact? Yep, he's gonna bunk up in the loft with you. You snore? I don't know, I don't think so. If you wake up in the water trough, you'll know. I can't even stand a horse who snores. Once when... Elizabeth's got supper waiting. Oh, uh, well, we'd better get on over there, Bill. - C'mon. - [Bill] I'll see you later. That you will. Well, hmm! Come on. - Dad! - Hey, hello, honey! Oh, it's time you came home. Darling, I want you to meet Bill Mayhew, new hand. This is my daughter, Elizabeth. - Pleased to meet you, Bill. - Pleased to meet you, too. You two get washed up, supper's ready. Oh, good. This way, Bill. Is this a celebration, or do you eat this way all the time? [laughs] It's the way we eat all the time. Do you like it? All I can say is, the next time you hire a man, don't mention the wages just carry around samples of food. - You hear that? - Yes, I heard, thank you. - I meant it, too. - Well, it isn't often I get a compliment like that. You know, this boy likes food so good he's even willing to wash dishes for it. - When he doesn't have to? - Yep, this'll prove it. Well. Well, I'm a little bushed from that long ride. - I think I'll turn in. - That's a good idea, Dad. With Bill around, maybe you can take it a little easier now. [laughs] And if he turns out to be a good dishwasher, so can you. - [chuckles] Good night. - Good night. I could get to like this. If I was sure of that, I might add a few more courses to the meals. Seriously, though, it's fun doing it because you want to and not because you have to. Well, it's not exactly man's work. Oh, I don't know. They say men make the best cooks. Why shouldn't they do a little cleaning up afterwards. Well, that's pretty revolutionary talk. You're gonna hear a lot more of it if I stick around here long enough. I'd like that. [chuckles] [glass crashes] I'll have Dad take that out of your wages. As long as you don't take it out of my hide. [glass crashes] Man's work? All right, you wash and I'll dry. First, the broom over there. - No! [laughs] - No? [laughing] No. - Hello, Bill. - Hi. Shindig, huh? Yeah, we have them around here every now and then. Schoolhouse? What do they do, dance on the desks? [chuckles] No, the fellows go over and take all the desks out, and then on Sunday they put them all back again. - Guess they need an extra hand? - No, but, uh, I do. Well, sure, I'll help you tack 'em up. Well, that isn't exactly what I meant. This is a one-man job, but, well, it does take two to polka. You just got yourself a dancing man. Well, I thought you'd never ask! Gimme a whisky. [coins clink] You wanna get rid of that chicken feed? What's your game? You name it, stranger. Such a piddlin' sum of money, doesn't seem worth while sittin' down for. Doesn't seem worthwhile my takin' up your time with, either. Name it. Short and sweet. High card for the nine bucks. You cut for me, and I'll cut for you, okay? Hey, boys, we got a real sport. All right, sport. This house ran out of luck. - You wanna go for the 18? - Sure. Hey, sport, you really been kissed by a bluebird. That makes 36 bucks. - Try it again. - All of it. Now that makes $72, again? Sure thing. This is a right nice game, that's $144. [man] Yeah, it goes on and on and on. Try it again, huh? That makes $288, you wanna quit? - Pass the deck. - [man 1] Don't be a sucker! [man 2] Why don't you quit while the quittin's good? You gotta lose sometime. [patrons murmur] [man] That's what I say. Let's see what he gets this time. Go ahead. [patrons chatter] Well, it's $576. One more time. Once more, only keep your eyes on me and don't run your fingers over the edges of the cards, understand? Look, mister, if you got some idea-- Just do what I tell you and skip the talk. Go ahead, take a cut. Not on that cut. I told you not to finger the deck. - Wait a... - Let's not lose our temper. What's the trouble? I just didn't like the way this gent was fingerin' the deck. You look like an honest man. You make the cut. I'm Jim Donovan, I own this place. Well, that's all the better. I'm sure you wouldn't want any of your customers doubting the honesty of your card games. Put your gun away, I'll cut for ya. Well, you cut so well for me, I'll let you cut for the house, if you don't object. Not at all. Satisfied? Perfectly. Well, why don't you join me in a drink while Rick cashes in your winnings? [patrons murmuring] Wouldn't want you to go away from here bearing any hard feelings towards us. Well, I'd like to drink with you. Always hated leaving hard feelings behind me. What's your name? Tom Blackwell. That was a pretty nervy stunt you pulled. Was it? You know I couldn't afford to let you lose. I was kinda bankin' on that. Pretty handy with a gun, too, fast. Could get you into trouble someday. Could get me out, too. What's your line? Anything, most anything at all. [Â¶ upbeat playful music] [patrons applaud] [Â¶ mid-tempo relaxing music] I'd like to have you folks meet Bill Mayhew. This is Miss Honeywell, the school teacher. - How do you do? - And Sheriff Luke Kimbrough. - Glad to know you, sheriff. - Bill's working for me. Well, glad to have you around, Bill. Thanks a lot. Go ahead and dance, Bill. Just grab yourself a pretty girl and cut right in on her. Well, do you have anybody in mind? Me. [all laugh] Hey, you are a good dancing man. You didn't believe me, huh? Well, you Texans are always bragging, I wasn't sure. When a Texan tells you something, just double it and you'll have it almost up to normal. [Elizabeth chuckles] - Evenin', Elizabeth. - Evenin', Randy. Excuse us. Getting a lot of competition, Mr. Mayhew. I guess that's what I get for bringing the prettiest girl in the territory, present company excepted. Hi, Jim. Hi, Luke, shake hands with Tom Blackwell, a new addition to my establishment. Luke Kimbrough, our sheriff. Kinda unusual seeing you around these community doings, Jim. Well, I'll only stay a minute. I just thought I'd bring Tom over. At that, I guess these school dancing contests are as much my affair as anyone's. Being the biggest taxpayer in town. I better be civic-minded just to see where my money's going to, if nothin' else. Who're those men over there? I don't know the younger fellow, probably a new man working for Jim. Jim who? Jim Donovan, runs the biggest saloon and gambling house in town. Had my way, I'd run him clean out of the territory. - [applause] - Looks like they're havin' fun. Well. [Â¶ slow romantic music] You're new around here, aren't you? Oh, I've been here a couple of days. My name's Tom Blackwell. My name's Elizabeth Sutton. Two very pretty names, and they belong to a very beautiful dancer. Thank you, you're the type that makes friends easily, aren't you? Well, kind of a methodical man, I am. Before I start anything, I always say to myself, now if the worst thing happens, will it be worth it? And if I figure it is, I go right ahead. That's the way I figured this. - What do you call the worst? - Oh, I don't know. Whatever it is, it's a small price to pay for dancing with the prettiest girl I've seen since I left Texas. - So soon? - The rules, I'm afraid. Bill, this is Tom Blackwell. Bill Mayhew, he works for my father. - How do you do? - Howdy Bill. - Been here long? - Couple of days, you? - A little longer. - He's from Texas, too. Fancy that. Why don't you show us some of that famous Sutton hospitality and get us some punch. All right, but don't you two fellows tell too many lies about Texas while I'm gone. We'd better talk. Shoot, you took your old name back, huh? It's a good name, I'm proud of it. Besides, we're a long way from Texas. I'm keepin' mine, it's been lucky for me. I got a mighty good job, stand to make $1,000 a month. Mr. Sutton was telling me something about the guy you work for. So you finally found a career for yourself, huh? Hired gun-hand. For big money you gotta take chances. It's your funeral. If it is, it's none of your business. This town better be big enough for both of us, Bill, 'cause I'm not giving up that kind of money. What are you two talking about? Oh, like you predicted, just, uh, wasting time lying to each other about little old Texas. [Â¶ lively bouncy music] I like it better out here. It is a pretty night. Couldn't be prettier. I think we better go in, hmm? I wouldn't concern myself too much about him. He's a very nice fellow. In my opinion, he's just another quick-tempered Texan. If I were you, I wouldn't got too mixed up with him. It's all right, Bill, he's just a kid. and bring back some horses, 18 head. Where are you gonna put 'em? Well, that's the problem. I was hoping Shad would board 'em for another week or so, but, but he won't. Well, we can't get back here afore morning, now. Better bring your blankets. I'll get some grub. Bringin' them horses back in here, huh? There's nothing else to do with 'em. You call that keepin' a secret? C'mon, boy. What secret, what's he talkin' about? You ever get bit by an armadillo? - No. - Knowed a fella' once that did. Nosiest man you ever see'd. Always askin' questions. Lost his thumb up to here. Armadillo snapped it right off. - Hi. - Hi. - See you recovered all right. - Didn't you expect me to? Well, I don't know, with all the fellas at the dance trying to wear you out, I still think you should be more careful about who you go outside with. I thought we had that all out at the dance. Maybe I'm taking too much for granted. About what? About you and me. Maybe you're trying to make things move too fast, Bill. All right, but when a fellow sees something worth working for he just likes to win, that's all. You've got lots of time. Stop moonin', let's get going. What's Sutton gonna do with all them horses? Don't you like horses? Expected him to come and get 'em last week. Ain't you never been busy? Owes me a week's board bill for 18 head. Yeah, yeah, I'll tell him. You know, I'm not by nature a curious man, but I can't help wondering about what Ewing said. What is Sutton gonna do with all these horses? Is it again the law for a man to like horses? No, not this many. He bought some in Denver, too. Maybe he's gonna start a stagecoach line. Stagecoach, huh? [Whipsaw] From Central City to Denver, maybe. But, that's a legitimate enterprise. - 'Course it is. - Then why all the secrecy? He don't want Jim Donovan to find out. Oh, Donovan, huh? [Whipsaw] Oh, Sutton's headin' for trouble, all right. I told him that. Well, if we're gonna bed down at the river by nightfall, we better hightail it. [horse neighs] Let's jump 'em now and get it over with. They're too close to the ranch. We'll wait till morning. [horse grunts] [horses neigh] [gunshot] Donovan's men, it has to be. You reckon he knows already? [gunshot] He ain't stampeding horses for the fun of it. - This is sure gonna be a wallop to Sutton. - Not if we get 'em back. Yeah, and how are ya gonna do that, with bird calls? - We'll round 'em up. - [gunshot] I'm too old for that kind of foolishness. You're not that old. I saw you haul yourself out from under those covers with a gun in your hand. Keep him pinned down. [gunshots] Drop it! You know this man? Yeah, yeah, I know him, Pecos Larry. But he ain't exactly what you'd call a social friend. Who you working for? Answer me! I just like to play with horses. Get up. In there. Keep him covered. Take his gun. There's only one here, there should be two. Where is he? Right here, freeze! Lose the guns. On your face, spread-eagle! Well, now, if you ain't full of tricks. Keep on and I'm gonna wind up liking you. - Get some rope and tie 'em up. - Yeah. All of you work for Jim Donovan? Yeah. I told ya we should've kept goin'. But you wanna be a hero. Oh, shut up. Big George kept going, he didn't wanna be a hero. Will you shut up? We'll tie 'em up nice and neat and leave 'em here 'til we get back, eh? [chuckles] Get them together. Ever tell ya how I learned to tie knots? - Nope. - Ever serve in a wind jammer? No. I did, never forget the time in Australia, tied up the ship so tight she pulled half the dock out to sea. [both laugh] That ain't no story, it's a fact. Hm, ain't a fact. Morning. Mornin', anything I can do for ya? Well, you can settle an argument between Big George and me. Loves to argue, Big George [chuckles]. - He's never right. - Well, if I can, I-- Well, Big George and a couple of the boys were ridin' down the valley this morning and they ran into a horse stampede. Said they saw Whipsaw and that, uh, fellow you brought from Denver with the herd. - How many horses did you see? - Eighteen head. Yeah, and I said the only reason a man would want that many horses would be if he was gonna start a stagecoach line. Well, since you're not gonna start a stagecoach line, I said those couldn't be your horses. Well, who was right, Big George or me? [laughs] Well, I'll be doggoned if you didn't finally win an argument. Drinks are on me, Big George. Donovan, he stampeded those horses. But how did he find out? Well, how does he find out anything? No, Dad! It's the only way to handle him. I don't care about Donovan. [horse hooves clop] Well, what do you know? What do you know? [horses neigh] Mr. Donovan. Did you forget something? Look kinda silly, don't they? - How did it happen? - You ever been in a stampede? How did he get the horses back? Can't figure it out neither. He just stood out there a snortin' and they come a runnin' from everywheres. [laughs] I appreciate this, Bill, I sure do. - It's all right, Mr. Sutton. - I appreciate it, too, Bill. [John] I figured Donovan would find out sooner or later. He just found out sooner, that's all. It means trouble, big trouble. Why would Donovan want to stop a stagecoach line? Because it'd make money. And anything that makes money, Donovan wants to run. - And we'd make money, too. - Lotsa gold back in the hills. But a stagecoach is legal property. A man's got a right to protect his own property. If he wants a fight, let's give it to him. You want to take on half that fight for half the profits? You just got yourself a partner. But this one had to shoot somebody, as usual. This time he found someone a little too tough for him. He came up on me from behind, two of 'em. Two of 'em, you shouldn't feel so bad about it. He was just too good for you. I thought you were a big man around here. Any doubt in your mind? Some, you're not thinking very good for a big man. Wanting to kill a man on your side. - On my side? - Yeah, your side. He's going to get the stagecoach line runnin', isn't he? Well, why don't you let him get it running and then take it over? No fuss, no bother. You're a bright boy, Tom. You are for a fact. [chuckles] Suppose you tell me what you found out about Garrett. Well, he's got about 100 head of three-year olds. They look pretty good. Well, you're a bright boy, go buy 'em. - Buy 'em cheap. - How cheap? Well, I offered him $30 a head for some poorer stuff a couple of months ago. He only laughed at me. Said he could get five times that amount by taking them to the mines himself. Well, he tried that, lost every steer. He oughta be in the proper frame of mind now to do business. Take Big George and Pecos Larry with you. - Garrett's got a nasty temper. - I don't need a bodyguard. Do what I tell ya and don't be so cocky. A man works for me does what he's told and don't waste my time arguin'! The only reason I mentioned it, it's 'cause three witnesses are better than one, in case there's trouble. All right, I'll take 'em. Not that they'll be any use. You figure you can get those way stations set up in a week's time? I hope so, we've got it laid out. It shouldn't take much longer. Well, you've done awful well with it so far, Bill. Let's hope it turns out the way we've got it planned. Your friend's gettin' up in the world. My friend? I never laid eyes on him before the other night. Well, it's funny how a man will lie when there isn't any need for it. I know a Texas rig when I see one, and it's more than a coincidence when two of 'em wind up in the same town, particularly when both horses have been branded with the same iron. What did you and Tom do that you had to leave Texas in such a hurry? Does it matter? Well, I ain't a pryin' man. I ain't one to get this partnership off on the wrong foot, either. Whatever you want to tell me, Bill, it'll stay right with me. He's my brother, got quite a temper, Tom has. Last time he got in trouble, I broke him outta jail. Yeah, I figured he was a wild one, all right. [dog barks] I'll do all the talkin'. All right, big man. Howdy, ma'am, is your husband home? Oh howdy, Garrett, shade cold today. What do ya want? Well, I heard you had some steers to sell. I came to make a deal. - You buyin' for Jim Donovan? - Yeah, that's right. I swore I'd shoot the next Donovan man who set foot on my land. Now, I'm giving you ten seconds to get off! - Now wait a minute. - Get! [Sam] Come on, Pecos. I don't scare that easy, big man. [guns fire] Oh, Jim. Oh, Jim! [sobs] You oughta talk some sense into your husband. Get away from here, and leave us alone. Oh! I shoulda killed you. Come on. [Sam] He's gun crazy. Eight little stitches they took in his head, and you shoulda heard him yelling. - It hurt. - It hurt. [laughs] Did you ever have eight stitches taken in your head? I want you to go down to the jail and give yourselves up. Give ourselves up? I'm turning the three of you in, swearing out a warrant and everything. Now wait a minute, Jim. [Jim] Now don't get excited. Garrett shot at you first, didn't he? - That's right. - Well, why not let the sheriff know that you shot back in self-defense? Well, how long do we have to stay in jail? [Jim] Oh, until he goes down and talks to Garrett. A couple of hours, I'd say. Yeah, what if Garrett tells a different story? We'll cross that bridge when we come to it. You're learnin'. [door shuts] You mind tellin' me what you're doing, Tom? No, it's a soft wall. It's a handy thing to know. But, why? Donovan's getting us out pretty soon. Well, for future reference. [Pecos groans] Keep the crybaby quiet. Well, he hurts. [Sam] Well, he's going to hurt some more if he don't shut up. You heard me, quiet! [door clangs] - Let's go, Tom. - Sheriff back? Not yet, Tom here's got himself a visitor, a lady. I thought you'd be more, uh, comfortable in here. Thanks, Ben. It was nice of ya to call on me, Elizabeth. I just heard about it a few minutes ago. What happened? What'd you hear? That you shot Garrett. Well, he shot at me first. I had to protect myself. He's not hurt bad, I made sure of that. But you're in jail, why? Well, I came here of my own free will. I was... It's nice to know you worried about me. I was kinda hoping our little meeting at the dance would lead to bigger and better things. The only reason I'm here is because Bill's out of town, or he'd be here himself. It's sure nice to know that everybody's worried about me. Anything that happens to you, is Bill's concern. Why, 'cause we're both from Texas? No, because you're brothers. Bill told you that? No, Dad guessed it, Bill didn't deny it. Tom, listen to me, you've got to pull away from Donovan. - You've just got to. - Why do I got to? Because you'll get into trouble, and then Bill'll get into trouble. Look, Bill's Bill, and I'm me. I worry about me, and I let him worry about himself. There are other ways to make money. - Not this much. - Then you ought to be man enough to take less somewhere else. You know, I can't figure out if you're talking like a sister, a sister-in-law... ...or just a real true admirer. Stop it! When Bill comes back into town, you better tell him to send a woman to do his work. - What'd you find out? - Garrett admits he threatened you, and shot first. You know something, he was trying to kill you. He needs some shootin' lessons. [Bill] Now this is the way it lays out, our first stop is right beyond Putnam here. A woman named, Mrs. Dover, got two grown boys and a big barn. Forty dollars a month. That's good. What about grub? Oh, she'll feed us. The food's good, too. I can vouch for that. We ferry Antelope creek here. It's dry now, but it fills up in the winter. A man named Wittenburg, ten dollars. Mm-hmm. A night stop here at Holtsville. We stay at Mansion House. You remember that. We stopped there on the way out. - Yeah, I remember. - We leave there at seven o'clock in the morning. We oughta make Denver one o'clock the same day. Hmm, well, you've done a good job, Bill. - A fine job. - Thanks. Did ya get the Concord? Yeah, it's stored in Bill Norton's barn a couple of miles out. Now, we can distribute the horses to the relay stations tomorrow, and on Wednesday, you can pull out bright and early for Denver. The sooner the better. I'll leave now and get a bite. - I saved the best thing for the last. - What's that? I talked to the United States Commissioner for the territory. Put in application for a mail contract. Bill, we're gonna get a government mail contract. That's great. That's just great! I'll see you later. Hey, that horse of yours's all tuckered out. Never seen a horse so tuckered. [chuckles] I was in kind've a hurry. He was in a hurry. He musta'... Elizabeth? Well, what do ya know? Oh! I thought it was Dad. - Good evening, Elizabeth. - Welcome home. How was the trip? Fine. Everything's good. The stagecoach line gets started on Wednesday. Oh, Bill, that's wonderful. Why don't you get cleaned up, and I'll fix you some supper. Oh, that can wait. I brought you somethin' from Denver, here. [gasps] Red silk! Oh, Bill, it'll make a beautiful dress. - That was the general idea. - But why? Well, lots of reasons. The first one is, pretty as the stuff is, you'll make it look even prettier. And the second one is I... I... well, I just hoped to catch your eye with it. Oh, thank you. It's... it's lovely. What's the matter? Don't you like it. Bill, your brother shot a man. - Who? - A rancher named Ed Garrett, argument over cattle buying. - Kill him? - No. - Where is he now? In jail? - No. Donovan got him out. Come on, I'll fix your supper. [people chattering] Whiskey. What's on your mind? Hear you shot a man. Self-defense. Yeah. Well, I'm tellin' ya. It doesn't make any difference. The next one'll be easier, ya know. You oughta know. That's why I'm here. Look, I know you're only a kid, but you remember as well as I do. What you don't remember is knowing you've killed a man. Self-defense or not. They throw you in the cooler for about a year for that and let ya think it over. So don't start preachin' to me. We're all through with that. All right. If I make ya a nice clean deal, will ya listen? Well, if it's money, I'll listen. Just 'cause blood's thicker than water, or so they say. I'm half-partners with Sutton. Why don't you come to work for us? I'll give you half of my half. D'you think that'd reform me? - Will ya do it? - Sure! You don't offer me the deal 'cause you thought I could help. You're just doin' me a big favor, like always! You're just bein' your noble, big brother self! Well, I don't like people who are noble, especially you! So get this straight! You live your life, and I'll live mine! Now get outta here! Why don't you watch where you're goin'? Let's get him to the doctor. [people murmuring] Where was your gun when he was slugged? That's my business. [Â¶ upbeat music] [whooping] This here the Fourth of July, or just the day we start the stagecoach line? [mutters] Wow! Hey! Can I see you a minute? - You Sutton? - That's right. - You're Mayhew? - Yes, sir. I got $20,000 in gold dust I'd like to get aboard your stage to Denver. - [Bill] Yours? - And some others'. We heard about your line and figured it'd be more safe for you to take it than for us to haul it over the mountain. We'll take it for you, Mr. McGovern. Take full responsibility, of course. Full responsibility, all the time, it's in our charge. But you better get it down here in a hurry. We're leaving pretty quick. Got it right here, in the bottom of this grain sack. Well, pull inside. We'll help ya unload it. You realize what that means, takin' responsibility for that gold? We're running a stagecoach line, responsibility's part of it. We lose that gold, it'll cost us everything we've got. - We won't lose it. - All right. McGovern turned the gold over to 'em. - They're unloading it now. - Get Tom. When he gets here, you know what to do? Yeah. We'll hit him on that first trip out. We'll wreck 'em. They'll be laughed right out of the territory. We've gotta have some more help. We can't handle it by ourselves. Isn't going to be that kind've a holdup. Tom. The boss wants you. Don't tell me you're goin' to send me out on another wild goose chase. Are you tired of bein' a cattle buyer? Well, I'm gonna be, that is if you don't start givin' me a price I can work on. Hey, you've been touchy lately. Why don't you have a cigar and cool off? I just wanted to de-fang you before we had a little talk. Funny how information gets around. Now, I have a proposition that concerns him. There's a lotta gold dust going out on that stage. I want it. And you're going to get it for me. Well, now, I'd be real happy to help ya. Should I ask Bill to drop it off down in front, or would you like me to go down and pick it up? You're going to write him a little note, telling him to come and see me. And if he wants you to stay alive, he'll come and talk to me. What makes you think he cares what happens to me? I'm a great judge of human nature. Write the note. [Bill] "Bill, I've put my foot in it good this time. Jim Donovan says if you don't drop around and see him, you're going to be minus a brother. I'm in a mess I can't get out of without your help, and don't get any bright ideas. Just do what Donovan says. Tom." Elizabeth. Read this. When'd you get this? A moment ago, a kid gave it to me. Bill, this sounds serious. Tom'd make it sound that way. Otherwise, he'd be afraid I wouldn't come. Has Tom ever asked for help before? Has he ever come right out and begged for it, like he's doing here? No. Well, then there must be a good reason for it. I don't think he's the type that scares easily. Maybe I better take a look. [Â¶ lively piano music] I want to see Donovan. All right. I knew you wouldn't let me down, Bill. What do you want? McGovern's gold dust you're carryin' to Denver. No dice. You know, in the short time he's been with me, your brother's become a valuable asset to my organization. [chuckles] I've become attached to him. It would grieve me deeply if he came to any harm. What if you do get the gold? Then I'd give ya both 24 hours to clear outta the territory. What about you? Haven't you got anything to say? Why? There's no noble blood in me, not a drop. That's the way it is, Bill. How do I know you'll keep your word? You don't... but I will. I don't expect any trouble from you two 'cause you'll be in it as deep as I am. They'll blame you for the gold's disappearance. All right, you can have the gold. It won't be easy though. John Sutton's riding gun guard. It'll be easy, practically painless. All you've gotta do is follow orders. [people chattering] Oh, there you are. Is Tom all right? Did ya ever hear of a bad penny not turning up? - What was the matter? - Been gambling heavily, that's all. Donovan was holding a lot of his IOUs. - I promised to make 'em good. - Oh, Bill. [John] With all this gold, I'm gettin' a little worried. Let's get it aboard, and get rollin'. This may be the beginning of great things, Dad. I'm proud of you. - Well, I had a lot of help. - Aww. Where do I come in? - Goodbye, Bill. Good luck. - Thanks. [Â¶ band plays upbeat tune] Get up! Hah! [whistles] [crowd cheering] It's a great day for Central City, sheriff. Sutton and Mayhew deserve a lot've credit. They had enough civic pride to want to bring the outside world in to us. Maybe we'll start booming now. Yes, sir, they deserve a lot've credit. I'll get off here. You guys go in alone. You won't have any trouble. Bill Mayhew's expecting you. Yep, see ya later. Get up! Hyah! That's it, up ahead. Anybody hungry? - We're all starved. - Good. We're here. Whoa. Whoa. Hello, Mrs. Dover. You're right on time. That's our motto: Right on time. - Can the folks go inside? - Surely. - This is John Sutton, Mrs. Dover. - Howdy. It's a pleasure, ma'am. Have you got some grub ready? - Yes, indeed. - You go and eat, John. I'll help with the horses and look after the box. Good. You got room for an express box to Denver? - I might have. Where is it? - Over there. - You're Joslyn, aren't you? - Yeah. Donovan described you. Bring 'em over here. By the way, Donovan said he had special plans for your brother before you find him in an alley, if you don't play it straight. - You goin' back there now? - Yeah, soon as I pick up Pete. Load that other box in the booth. Son, you got a good horse I could borrow? - Sure. - Saddle him up for me, will ya? - Here it is. - Well, that's good. You go and eat now. We gotta keep on schedule. This is as far as I go. You know the road the rest of the way. You won't have any trouble. What's the matter with you? We're partners, John. You'll have to trust me. They'll be some men waiting for you at Big Pine Creek. They'll be friends. It's seven o'clock. They should've been here by now. Looks like a double-cross, boss. I don't think so. What are you doin' here? I just came back to see you kept your part of the bargain. - Did they get the box? - Just like you planned. Come on, let's go. Not 'til I get the box. [horses approaching] They're comin'. You mean you gave us the gold, just like that? Yeah. That's the price of your life. [Sam] You chump. Did you really think they'd a killed me? That's what the man said. [chuckling] - Where's the key? - No key. You fellas go. We'll split tomorrow. Break this open. - What's this? - Stand easy! Dealing with such a smart man, Mr. Donovan, I couldn't be sure you wouldn't kill him, so we've got our stagecoach line and he's got his life. And you've got some rocks. [grunting] [gun fires] [piano keys play] Try the other one. [gun cocks] You were right. I couldn't. Come on. We got work to do. [Sam] Hyah! Hyah! That kid can't drive any better than he can shoot.
