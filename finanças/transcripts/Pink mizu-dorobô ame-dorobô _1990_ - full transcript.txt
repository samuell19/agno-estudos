By the way, why aren't you wearing any clothes? I was taking a bath. Ah, a bath. OK, I see. Oh yeah, is that hover bike yours? Yes. Gotcha. It's nothing serious. There was a theft near this area using a hover bike. Ahem. Where are your parents? Both of my parents died 2 years ago. Ah...sorry to hear that. What is your name? My name is Pink! Hey, haven't you seen him before? - Those pictures. - Ah, that's right. Pink made me take those pictures last year. Hey Black, my underwear... Hurry and give me my underwear!

This was my mom's treasure box! Hmm? Wha...? Ah! What's this? Pink, that's called an umbrella. You use it when it rains. Rain? Oh man... - What a waste... - Hey White, is it like this when it rains?

Don't feel bad. I am a professional. Die! Cobalt Blue-san! Hi, Pink-chan. Wh-Why are you interrupting?! That little girl is the thief! I know, but don't you think it's a little too much to kill her? My job is to arrest her. I'm a professional too. I won't let this happen! Huh. Well then, I'll fight you with my fists. Lousy punk! TAKE THIS! Ah! Strong... You're so strong! Cobalt Blue-san, you're so cool! Now, Mr. Killer. Are you giving up? No, Yamamoto! Don't go over there! Hey, Silver-san... Why does it feel like you're hiding something over there? No, Sheriff! Don't touch that! You dumbass, that door is made so that it's hard to open. Eat this! Cobalt Blue-san! HERE! Mmm, strong... You are really... Hey! NO! Very... Stop it! Strong... I've lost.

TL: Raijin is the Japanese God of Thunder. He makes it rain. Raijin...? - W-Well, that's it... - Wait a second. So, this is how you have so much water. I'll have to arrest you. Ladies and gentlemen! You've been waiting so long for this, now it's time to make it rain again! HAI-TAAA! Ahh! It's raining! Woo-hoo! Yay! Oh, Pink-chan. I stole the water. Why aren't you arresting me? Ah, that's fine. Silver was the one who was doing bad things. And now it's raining. Can you please get under this umbrella with me? Umbrella? Cobalt Blue, you remind me of my dear departed dad. Then...maybe I'll become your dad for real, Pink-chan. Huh?! Huh?! Huh?! Huh?! Really?! That makes me so happy! Black, White, and Red. We'll all be together?! Yeah. It should be a lot of fun! Hey, Raijin! I think we're good without rain for a while! I think I took it a little too far...haha... Just rain. Walking in the rain. Holding hands in a rainy town.
