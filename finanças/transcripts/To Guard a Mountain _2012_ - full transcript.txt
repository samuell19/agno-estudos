Come here! Show me how it's done. Pull it together first. Tighten it hard. Pull it under. Under! No, you're doing it wrong. I've told you a thousand times. You can't even close a fence. You're useless. There! If I were to die today, you wouldn't manage on your own. - Now what are you going to do? - Find the lamb. Do it right now. - And you, go read something. - There's no school today. - Why didn't you say it was your fault? - It wasn't! Shut your mouth. Go now. Hey, get over here. Lift that side. Right there. That's good. What are you waiting for? Find the lamb! Mom, throw me my jacket! - Ow! Dad! - Now what? Stop crying. It's nothing. I told you not to play with that knife. You're a big boy now. You shouldn't cry for nothing. Off you go! Hello, Hadji, have you seen a lamb? Give them to me. What have you done? Run over the cigarettes with a tractor? Come on, walk. Hello, aunt. Have you seen our lamb? - Aunt, have you seen our lamb? - Are you deaf, or what? Hello, have any of you seen a lamb? Turn it the other way. Watch out for the doors! Use your heads, you idiots! Put it down. Put it down! - What does it look like? - Like a cow? It looks like a lamb! - Have you lost it? - No, I'm trying to find you a wife. His father is going to give him a beating. Hey, do you have a cigarette? Are you coming, or should I send you home? Isn't this dad's lighter? - He gave it to me. - You're scared he'll see you smoke. Shut up! You walk around with that stupid stick all day. - You play as much as I do! - Why do you always have that stick? - I don't know. Because. - Because. Stupid kid! Let's go. - He has to be around here somewhere. - It's a she! - What? - The lamb is a she, not a he. I'll look by the aqueduct, you look by the Snake Stone. I don't know the way. Don't act dumber than you are. You know the way. It's over there. Look. There's the road. Now go! - What in the world are you doing? - It started to rain. Oh really? Go out and start looking! But it's so cold! You think I feel sorry for you? Go! Don't just stand there! Keep looking! What? And then? You kept calling, but I didn't listen and ran off. And then? And then I climbed up a tree and fell down. And you have to say that I looked after you, I told you not to climb. And that you didn't listen to me. - I know, I know. - Repeat it for me. I know. I know. - You're a real man, you know that? - I am? Of course you are! Remember when Nedgat hit his head? He started crying like a little girl. When was that? When I broke those eggs we had bought at the store. And when we came home, dad was... - Are you all right? - Yes. - Then we need to find the lamb. - OK. You broke those eggs playing helicopter. Hamid? - Are you all right? - Yes. Here, drink this. Enough? Is it nearby? - There! - Isa, wait! Hamid! Hamid? I think I fell asleep. Where is the lamb? - Who is that? - I don't know. - He has a pistol. - It's not a pistol, it's a rifle. Excuse me, have you seen a lamb? Good evening, have you seen a lamb? I have seen many lambs. It's one lamb, walking alone. No. - What are you doing up here? - Could I have a cigarette? - I'm guarding my mountain. - Is it yours? Yes. From here, and all the way up there. Where do you buy a mountain? At the market? My father left it to me. We've been here a long time. Then you must be really tired. Do you really think you can call... Keep going! Keep going! What are you doing? Stop kicking her! - He doesn't listen! - Give her some grass. Dad doesn't give us candy when we don't listen. It's a she, not a he. - There! - Let's go. Isa... Isa! We're almost home. I can't walk anymore. Stop crying. You're a man. Men don't cry. I'm not a man. Yes, you are! If you aren't man enough for yourself, you'll never achieve anything in life. You want a cigarette? Hamid, look. Stop smoking! You're too young to smoke. Is that Hamid crying? Who am I now? - Stop! Don't do that. - You have sand in your ear. - We have to keep going. - Be funny again. - I will, at home. Dad's probably... - I'm sleeping. Hamid? Hamid! Are you all right? Come here. Come here, you ass. Where have you been? I've searched everywhere! The entire village has been worried sick about you! - What have you done to him? - Nothing! He didn't listen to me. He fell from a tree. Hamid? Hamid! - I found the lamb. - Forget about the damn lamb! Isa. He didn't fall from a tree. I met Hassan yesterday. That man that sells wood. - You know Hassan, right? - No. His house is by the road into town. He asked if I was interested in some German wood for table legs. I said, "No, no, I have planted my own trees." "And my son is helping me now." He said, "Your son? He's only a child." And I told him, "No, you don't know my son." "He is strong." "Like his father."
