[THEME MUSIC] Good afternoon, my fellow Americans. I speak to you today about a very serious matter concerning the safety of every American, and the safety of our beloved country itself. [BURPING] My orbital missile systems program will enable each of us to rest assured that no foreign missiles will ever penetrate the boundaries of our beloved country. But-- I told you he would talk about that stupid orbital missile system. Oh. [SLURPING] Good boy. Ugh! OK. Ha, ha. How do you like this? Good evening, you over-attacked morons. Ugh, what an asshole. [LAUGHING] We don't really need the "Star Wars" stuff. Ugh. I'm going to pee on you. And [INAUDIBLE]. Manufacture the weapons. [LAUGHING] [SIGHS] DOG: Oh, no. Not the flag again. Oh, he's going to wrap himself up with the flag. Whoop, yeah. There he goes. Because the Russians hate it. [LAUGHING] Invisible [INAUDIBLE]. Meh, I'm going to puke! [LAUGHING] So fuck them. Eh, you're the President. Shouldn't talk like that. Yeah. If you keep talking like that, this film will never get a PG rating. From the office of the President of the United States to Professor Dr. Michael Mutzbum-- you have read this, Comrade Gudenov? Yes, Premier Rusky. So he wants [INAUDIBLE] ready to launch the orbital missile system in time for his fucking birthday-- well, that son of a bitch American egomaniac must not launch his [INAUDIBLE], pitiful, useless orbital missile system! Not until we have one just like it. Yes, Premier Rusky. Contact two of our best K.G.B. in D.C. Yes, Premier Rusky. And Comrade Gudenov. I want to be sending nice flowers to Professor NutsBomb! Yes, Premier Rusky. Ah! [PHONE RINGING] Yuck. Comrade. Comrade! Answer the phone. [PHONE RINGING] Comrade, answer the phone! [PHONE RINGING] [MOANING] Oh! Mm. [BABBLING] Ah! [RUSSIAN], Comrade.

Incoming Soviet missile approaching Washington, D.C. Anti-missile missile launched. Orbital missile system failure. Orbital missile system failure. [EXPLOSION] You confident, idiots, you just destroyed Washington, D.C. -- enemy rocket. You pushed the wrong button! COMPUTER: This has been a test of [INAUDIBLE] file. Your idiotic design of a [INAUDIBLE] missile penetrate our air space. Whose fault is that? We are so damn far behind! There's no way in hall that we're going to finish this project in time. Why don't you just shut up? We are doing our best, you know. What I know-- May I have your attention, please? Now, here, this is your equation that should end all this ridiculous arguing. Beaker, get over here. [MUMBLING] When you entered this calculation into the tracking circuitry program-- hm? [CHOMPING NOISES] [BEEPING] COMPUTER: That's fine with the equation. Trial one. Enemy missile approaching Washington, D.C. Anti-missile missile launched. Enemy missile destroyed. [CHEERING] We just completed phase one. You have no time to waste, my friends. We must now begin work on phase two. Get me Michael NutsBomb on the phone, please. Right away, sir. [PHONE RINGING] Hello? NutsBomb here. Oh, Dr. NutsBomb. How are you today? Oh, fine, sir, just fine. And, um, how is your work going? Mr. President, we have completed work on phase one, and we've already begun on phase two. Is there um, anything you need-- anything I can do for you? I would like to be free of all these security people. You know, I'm never alone. Now, Michael, you know that would be impossible. When do you think we could go for a lunch? Well, there's so much work to be done yet-- all the calculations and equations, so the hardware, and the software. I don't think I'll even have time for lunch. Ha! [LAUGHING] Oh, it's rare, Michael, that a man of such genius has a sense of humor, as well. Fucking Jew. Bleh, fucking Nazi. Fucking hot dog. Hot dog.

You were saying? Barton, um, I'd just spoken to Dr. NutsBomb He's unhappy about being constantly under guard. Well, I'm sorry about that sir. But as you know, security is very tight right now. [BRAKES SCREECHING] Hey, use the blinker, dick head! What was that, Barton? No, not-- not you sir, sorry. You may be particularly sensitive with Dr. NutsBomb? Yes, sir. Yes, sir, I'll get right over to the global defense building, and uh, talk to NutsBomb in my [INAUDIBLE]. Agent number one here. Everything's clear. Agent number two reporting. All is well over here. Over. --[INAUDIBLE], they discovered the [INAUDIBLE]! Woo! I'll tell you-- lord is everywhere, people. The lord, Jesus Christ, it's everywhere. The Lord, Jesus Christ is everywhere!

You kill him? No. We missed him. [SPITTING] What do you mean, you missed him? We missed him. But we got American [INAUDIBLE], instead. I don't know what you are talking about! You're as useless as [INAUDIBLE] testicles. You will have to try again. He's already completed phase one. He has? Are you sure? Of course I am sure! You must kill NutsBomb, before he can complete phase two. If he does that, Comrade, you can kiss your ass goodbye. Good night. Borris! Borris! Why would he tell me to do that? To do what? Kiss my ass? Fuck you. [CHOMPING NOISES] [BABBLING SINGING] Oh, oh, brothers, brothers, brothers, have you guys [INAUDIBLE]? Grow some hair. [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE]. We love you. Peace and love.

[GUN SHOTS] Done. So sorry to be calling you so late again. But we missed-- we tried to shooting NutsBomb, and-- we shoot many Hare Krisna dancing boys instead. You have failed the Kremlin once again. You're as useless as Khrushchev's crotch! Now, stay in your room, until you hear from me again. Now, we have to stay in our room. Those, those-- stooges will never kill NutsBomb! Yerkov I must [INAUDIBLE] Yerkov now. I cannot wait any longer. [FOOTSTEPS] I've come for Yerkov. I'm Gudenov. OK. You can have Yerkov. [BANG] Comrade Yerkov, I'm Colonel Gudenov. You have a job to do in the United States. Don't forget this. Uh huh. Thank you. What you guys doing? What's wrong with my sombrero? [INAUDIBLE] Come on, man. Leave him alone, bunch of peckers. I hope you enjoyed my speech. Now, you must understand. This is vital-- crucial to our national security. Now, the orbital missile system is-- Oh, si senor. I am Andrew Hutz. The survival of my country depends upon the mechanical manifestations of our hat industry. I prefer a hat I can eat. Ha, ha. Well, thank you for your support. [LAUGHS] [CHOMPING NOISES] [CHOKING NOISES] [INAUDIBLE]. Support is there. Well, what have we here? Food! What is this? Chicken? Yes. Chicken. Pasta. Guacamole. No, it's hairy. Hairy? Shut up! Just eat it. Eat it! [LAUGHING] It's fish. Eat it! It's good. Maybe they'd like some over there. Doesn't he know who I am? I have this [INAUDIBLE]. [INAUDIBLE]? [LOUD FARTING NOISES] Oh! Ha, ha, ha, ha. NutsBomb. NutsBomb! NutsBomb! NutsBomb! Nuts-- god-- ja-- NutsBomb! Shit! I hate when this happens! God. Oh. Ugh. Mm. [MOANING] [FARTING] [TOILET FLUSHING] [LAUGHING] [LOUD BREATHING] [BONE CRACKING] [LAUGHING] [GRUNTING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC STOPS] [MUSIC NOTE PLAYING] [MUSIC STOPS] [MUSIC PLAYING] [DOOR KNOCK] Oliver, Barton Oliver, ay, ay, ay. Me? Hi. No time for pleasantries, doctor. Have you finished your examinations? Yes. And? Well-- Well? Our computer have analyzed several hundred [INAUDIBLE]. And that shows [INAUDIBLE] from each of the 20 [INAUDIBLE]. Yeah. Uh-huh. We have pinpointed a significant amount of toxic chemical indigenous to the Siberian mountain in the USSR. [INAUDIBLE] mother have the sample contained, the combination of certain [INAUDIBLE] material, and a trace particle of adding military molecules that our computer carers could only comfort-- and thus, [INAUDIBLE] most of native Russia. [LAUGHING] Uh-- look, you little prick. Either you stop giving me this techno crap and tell me what killed these people, or I'm going to blow-- Ah! -- your fucking head off! They died from a [INAUDIBLE]. But inhalation of [INAUDIBLE] toxic create tissue. What are you talking about? I'm talking about (WHISPERING) toxic gas. You mean they inhaled toxic gas? Precisely, Mr. [INAUDIBLE]. Oh, all right then. They inhaled toxic gas. They want the gas delivered. Pellet? Gas gun? [LAUGHING] No. Well, what? Ventilation system, aerosol? No. Well, how the fuck did he get in there then? He didn't. Uh, you know. It was delivered by Russia [INAUDIBLE]. How do we get it past the metal detector? He produce it in the [INAUDIBLE]. How? From what? (WHISPERING) It's [INAUDIBLE]. You-- You mean-- I'm afraid so. The poison fart. Hey, doc, check this out. Now, that's Dr. Lewis and Professor Clark. These are two of NutsBomb's assistants. Damndest thing. No knife. No bullet wounds. No evidence of foul play. Holy shit! I've got to get to the President! [INAUDIBLE] There's no telling where the poison fart may strike next! Excuse me. Pardon me. Pardon me, excuse me. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SHOUTING] I'm coming, Mr. President! Operator, give me the White House. The White-- hey, buddy, get out of there. The White Ho-- hey, pal, I've got to fucking dash through emergency here. Damn it! [GUNSHOT] Ah! Yeah, operator? Yes. 1600 Pennsylvania Ave-- hey, buddy, bu-- [GUNSHOT] -Ah. -That's right.

This is Oliver, Barton Oliver. Put me through to Agent 37-38. [PHONE RINGING] BARTON (ON PHONE): Hello? Hello? Hello? This is Oliver-- Barton Oliver. I've done it for you. Oh, my password, please. God damn it, Jack! Ah. Password, chocolate devil nut fudge. Pistachio, Bart. How you doing, sir? What's up? Yeah, listen, listen very carefully, Jack, and do exactly what I say, all right? What's you're 20? I'm in the garden. What are you doing there? I'm on my lunch break. Where's Roy? He's-- he's here. Well, now, where's the-- where's the-- where's the President? He's in his office. Good. Now, listen to me. Here's what I want you to do. I want you both to go to the President's office and secure it. This is code P579. Don't let anyone else in, and don't let the President out. Code-- code P579. Do I copy correctly? Yes, yes! Jack. Jack, be nimble! Jack, quick! Jack, Jack, do you hear me? Code P579. Ah! [HYPERVENTILATING] What is it? What is it? Jack, what's happening? What's wrong? [INAUDIBLE] Hello, Jack? Jack? Damn it, Jack! Jack, you numskull. Jack. Jack can you hear me? Yes, I can. Jesus Christ, code P579. How many of them are there? What kind of weapons do they have? How do they deploy? What are they? Iranians? Nicaraguans? Welfare recipients? No, no. Now, Jack, listen very carefully. NutsBomb was killed by a poison fart. What did you say, some type of a poison dart? No-- no, no! A poison fart. We are under a poison fart attack. Uh, I don't see any poison darts. Not poison darts, you moron! I think he said we're under a poison fart attack. You listen to me, Mr. I Think He Said. You're nothing but a disgusting bag of slime! You're just a vile and putrid carton of filth! And you're a very sick mother fucker! No, no, no! He's not a sick motherfucker. Well, guess he is a sick motherfucker, but he's right. We're under a poison fart attack-- fart! Frank Alpha Romeo Tango, fart! Frank, Alpha, Romeo, Tango, F-- Fart! Fart! Fart! Fart! See, I told you. Listen, Jack, I'm coming from the medical examiner's office. He told me those lousy comic bastards are using poison fart warfare! Communist? Co-- co-- farts? BARTON (ON PHONE): Yeah, yeah. That's how they killed NutsBomb and the others in that peace rally, and they just blew away two more today, Dr. Lewis and Professor Clark. Get over to the president's office now! Seal it! I'm on my way. Communist farters! BARTON (ON PHONE): Yeah! This really pisses me off! Me too. Shut up, you sack of pus! BARTON (ON PHONE): Shut up, Jack! Now, listen, you two idiots, go to the President's office. And Jack, don't let anyone fart near the President! JACK (ON PHONE): Count on it, sir. Oh, Biffy, you're going to love this. Ah! Uh! Hi, Biffy. Hey, what's up? Hi, guys. Hi, guys. Good afternoon, Mr. President. Oh! [GROWLING] Uh, what happened? Did the Russians invade or something? What the hell's going on here? Mr. President, I've got orders not to let anyone fart around you. What did he say? Well, that's right, Mr. President. We have orders not to let anyone fart around you. [FARTING NOISES] I'll fart anywhere I damn please. Holy shit! Oh my god! [GUN SHOTS] [CHOKING NOISES] [WHIMPER] Rot in hell, gas pad. Give Lenin my love. Biffy! [GUN SHOTS] Shit. Mr. President! Mr. President! Christ. What the hell is going on here? Mr. Commie traitor. Pit dog farted! And we shot him. [INAUDIBLE]! [CRYING] He already got him. You're right. He's dead, but not from a poison fart. OK, if it was a poison fart, it would have killed you to, wouldn't it, idiots! [SNIFFING] It's a perfectly good fart. And now, President Richard stands with the great patriots of our time. One of the greatest men ever living is gone. Probably because of a heart attack! And it's your fault! Well, all right. All right, it's probably just an honest mistake. I'll let it go this time, but try not to let it happen again, huh boys? Now, come on. Fix your tie, and we're going to go break the Vice President. (WHISPERING) Thanks, sir. Poor Biffy. [SINGING] [FLY BUZZING] Oh. Mr. Money, I'm going to see to it that you keep getting those contracts. I want to go shopping. [SINGING] And I'll see to it that you keep getting those kick backs. That's even better. Mel, I really want to go shopping. You thought I was never coming, didn't you? Oh, thank you. This is just in time. How sweet. Thank you. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! I have urgent business with the Vice President. I give [INAUDIBLE]. I'm sorry. You'll have to excuse us. This is top secret. Oh! [BABBLING] You see, as soon as [INAUDIBLE] told me about the poison fart, I called the P579. Well, Biffy farted. Not a Russian fart, a common, ordinary dog fart. I always knew Buffy was ugly as dirt, but I never thought he was a stinking communist. He wasn't, idiot. Anyway, these two assholes blow Biffy into next week. Stands gets an eyeful of dog meat. His ticker goes boom. He dies, and the upshot is you're the President. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to secure the area. Say what? You're the President. Yes, ma'am. Fix your tie. I'm the President. Oh my god. The first black, Jewish woman. President of these United States of America! [HELICOPTER NOISES] Well, the White House is not going to be so White anymore. Gentlemen, I assume you've all read this report and found it as astounding as I have. We have been subjected to indignities such as our country has never experienced before. Now, we must show the world that we are made of. We must preserve the integrity of our country. We must maintain the highest-- I say we bomb the hell out of them mother fucking communist pigs. General Hawk. Bomb them! President Stands might have stood for this kind of mindless suggestion, but I don't. I will not stand for what President Stands stood for. Do you understand? Is that understood? Do you understand? Nigger bitch. [GASP] Jack Roy-- Why, you insolent scum! [GUNSHOT] Ah. [GASP] Anything more to say, Mr. Talkback? Sit down, stupid hemorrhoid! Now, hand over the meeting to Oliver-- Barton Oliver. Thank you, Madam President. Now, gentlemen, there are three objective to accomplish. Each of you is here because of your individual area of expertise. Now, first, you must continue development of the orbital missile system so that it will be ready for deployment by the launch date of July 13th. Dr. Thesis? Well, unfortunately, Dr. NutsBomb was killed before he could five us the-- [STUTTERING] -the-- [STUTTERING] Ca-- calculus-- va-- va-- variable. Well, it's-- it's easy for you to say. Um, anyway, they're essential to the final equation needed to complete phase two. Listen, you faggot egghead. Just give us the bottom line, huh? Will we be able to launch by July 13th or not? Well, if, if the three of us, Dr.'s Bunson, Beaker, and myself work day and night, maybe. No maybe's, Dr. Do it. Now, if you'll turn to page 14 in your reports, you'll see the information we have on the Russian agent responsible for the deaths of Dr.'s NutsBomb, Lois, and Clark. Jack Cheese and Roy Berger, my two best agents, unfortunately, will be in charge of tracking down this Soviet scumbag. Now, luckily, we already know that he's addicted to weightlifting, so we expect him to serve us at a gym, and we'll nail him there. Our final objective is to-- Oh! for the United States a formula equal to or surpassing the Russian capabilities for flatulent warfare. The poison fart, gentlemen, is more than merely a disgusting joke. What the Russians have invented is a nearly perfect weapon-- swift, small, lethal, untraceable, and anyone can ingest the formula. Why, even the cutest little towhead in a frilly dress, with those adorable little saddle shoes can turn into a deadly farting machine by taking one small tablet. Oh. [COUGHING] This is the most vile, despicable, inhumane weapon this planet has ever seen. What's worse, we don't have it. It's where Dr. Me comes in. Dr. Me, your task will be to-- Dr. Me? Dr. Me? Dr. Me, I understand you've already isolated some elements of the formula? This residue was found in the [INAUDIBLE]. Ah. master-- master of the people. [INAUDIBLE] to some of you. I assure you, it's snot! It's snot? No, no, no, no, no, no. It's biotainted [INAUDIBLE]. What the fuck are you talking about? [LAUGHING] We are very close to getting the exact [INAUDIBLE]. Wha-- yeah. Your job, general, will be to recruit the most highly skilled and trained men from all branches of the military. Now, once the formula is perfected, they will form an elite strike core, able to fart it out with the best of them. That's free [INAUDIBLE], and I won't allow it. No, Jack! You want to join the club, Twinkles? Jack, no. No, down. [INAUDIBLE]. Wha-- what I mean is I won't allow it to [INAUDIBLE]. Thank you. And I think that about wraps it up, well, of course. Uh, you all know Harry Babel, the press secretary? Mr. Babble will continue to do for this administration what he did for the last administration, which is basically cover up all our activities with a weird series of bizarre lies and excuses. My accomplishments-- Harry. -might show that-- Harry? Shut up. Sit down. And as you all progress, you will report directly to me. Mm. Not Me, me. Madam President? Thank you. Gentlemen, the future of your country depends on you. You're all dismissed. Have you ever seen this man before? [GRUNTING] No. [GRUNTING] Let's go. [INAUDIBLE]. Get down. What the fuck are you looking at? Who is this prisoner? A terrorist, Arab. Iranian? I don't know. It doesn't matter-- killed hundreds of innocent people. Announced a blue light special on car bombs at a Kmart in Jersey. Scum. OK. Send in the fortranaut. OK, Jerry. Just choose the tablet, and count to three, and aim at the prisoner. [GULP] [CLEARING THROAT] [GAGGING] Why? Why-- why are you having this soldier put his ass in my face? What is this? [GRUNTING] Oh. [INAUDIBLE]. [HEAVING] Is this your-- your form of torture? [GRUNTING] Sorry. There's too much pressure. [LAUGHS] I don't feel too good, uh-- [BURP] Can I go home? No. [BURP] Now, Me-- this formula sucks! Oh! All right? This asshole can't fart-- is not farting-- will not fart. Now, fix it! Can I go now? [BURPING] Get out of here. [SIGHS] [GAGGING] Oh. Oh-- [HICCUP] [MOANING] Mommy, may I have some bubble gum? Oh! Yes. Can I help you? Yes, please. Oh, you have a cold. I have just the thing for you. No, no. No. What I have-- oh. A headache, you poor thing. Try some of these. No. You don't understand what I need. Say no more. There's no need to be embarrassed. This will do the job. Is there anything else I can get for you? [FARTING] Whoa! Ah. Ah! Mommy, that man really stinks. Whoa! Excuse me, sir, have you seen this man before? No. [PHONE RINGING] Oliver, Barton Oliver. JACK (ON PHONE): Barton, it's me, Jack. So, Jack, do you have any leads? JACK (ON PHONE): No. This guy is just nowhere to be found. Well, keep trying. And don't bother me here again until you find Yerkov, jerk off. Jesus. [INAUDIBLE] have something [INAUDIBLE]. Ah. The automatic elevation ingestor is non-operational. Come on. Let's take the stairs. I don't want to take the stairs. Yeah. Stairs are-- I don't know. [INAUDIBLE]. I like [INAUDIBLE]. [CHOMPING NOISES] Mm. Oh, boy. [FARTING] Ugh. Ah. Oh. [LAUGHING] He should have gone on a diet. [LAUGHING] Ah, OK. So I'm a prisoner. You'll be prisoners of us soon. Edward, you-- OK, Mark. Uh, take your pill. Unflap, and let one go. [SPITTING NOISES] Just let it happen naturally. [GRUNTING] Any time you feel comfortable. [SIGHING] I think what I'd do is brutally [INAUDIBLE]. Anytime at all. No! Watch you do is-- Anytime at all. [GRUNTING] [INAUDIBLE] the shits. Come on, Mark. You can do it. I know you can do it, Mark. Me, myself, my colleagues, you won't let it go on. Mark, you got to do it. Come on, boy. Cut one for your country. [GRUNTING] Come on, for the United States of America and to the republic-- for Richard Stands! [GRUNTING] One nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all! Come on, boy! Let her fly! Ah! [FARTING] (CRYING) Why are you doing this to me? [CRYING] Oh! You [INAUDIBLE]. Ah! Ah! No, stop! Please. [SCREAMING] Oh, oh, stop. Oh, god. Oh, no! No more! [GROWLING] Oh! PRISONER: Please, no more. No more! Ah! What? I mean, uh, Oliver. Martin Oliver. Yes, Martin. Yes, I've just been informed that Dr. Beaker has been farted to death. Yerkov got Dr. Beaker? Where? Oh, somehow, he got into the global defense building disguised as a candy machine. I'm taking Dr. Bunson and Dr. Thesis now to a safe house. DR. BUNSON: [INAUDIBLE], how did you ever get to be assigned [INAUDIBLE]. You're-- I don't want to work. PRESIDENT: How are things there? They're going very well here. I-- I think we're, we're very close to-- No more, no. Please. MARTIN: --Uncovering something. Take this off. This is revolting. Remember, gentlemen, you must complete your mission. The future of your country is in your hands. What it is is what it'd be. Let's hook it up. Excuse me. Have you ever seen this man before? [BIKES SQUEAKING] I said, excuse me, have you seen this man? Excuse me, have you ever seen this man before? Never seen this man before. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] We've never seen this man before either. Ah. [PHONE RINGING] MAN: Yeah? Oliver. Barton Oliver. Barton, sir, it's, it's me, Jack. Ah! We've-- we found him. -No! -What was that? Ah! I-- I said we've, we found him. PRISONER: Ah! Ah! What was that? Oh, that? It's a-- uh, they're a-- Somebody save me! Never mind, never mind. Look, Jack, [INAUDIBLE]. And Jack, don't let him out of your site. No problem. Ah! Somebody save me! Ah! [INAUDIBLE] Oh, oh no! No more! -Send Frank in. No more! No more torture! [CRYING] Good luck. Thank you. OK, frank, here's what I want you to do. No! No! Take the pill, and uh, don't pay any attention to him. Shut up, you cry baby. Take the pill, and uh, turn your back to him, and let it rip. No! (CRYING) Don't. No, don't do this. Whatever you're going to do, don't do it to me. Allah! Don't. [CRYING] Oh. [FARTING TO "STAR SPANGLED BANNER"] Praise be to Allah! Ah! Ah-- ah-- ah. [COUGHING] [SNARE DRUMS PLAYING] Is that for me? [GASP] You've done it. You've created a poison fart formula! Ah! [INAUDIBLE]. [SCREAMING & LAUGHING] [INAUDIBLE] Ah! And I'm pleased to say that since I have been sworn in as President of the greatest, free-ist, most powerful nation on earth, that unemployment has gone down. The gross national product has gone up. Student uprising has gone down. And most of all the orbital missile system will soon blow up. That [INAUDIBLE] nigeress has got to go! [GRUNTING] [DOOR KNOCK] What is it? I want Yerkov. Who sent you? Gudenov. Gudenov. I am Comrade Pushka Tartsky, K.G.B. Gudenov sent me to join forces with you against American imperialist capitalist pigs. You are fartnik? I am fartsnik. Together, we will fart off the American woman president. That may not be so easy, Comrade Pushka. She is not as dumb as all the other American Presidents. We will do it together, Comrade. Of course, we can. How about some nice, Russian vodka? You look like you lift some very heavy weights. I too am from good Russian stock. I would like a work out. May I? Of course. Yes. Yes! Yes! [LAUGHING] I will join you. Ha. All right. I want the bug on that Soviet scum bags. Inside window, by the walk. All right. Check it out. [SPITTING] (WHISPERING) Here we go. Oh. Oh, push guys. Never felt them so round and firm. Oh. Unbelievable. These are bigger than the mountains in Russia. What's going on? RUSSIAN: Ugh! -Come on. Let me hear. RUSSIAN: Ah! Come on. PUSHKA TARTSKY: Oh, yes. Bring it up. RUSSIAN: Oh! Listen to me, you idiot. We're talking about the security of the United States! Give me [INAUDIBLE]. PUSHKA TARTSKY: Bring it. Your family, your friends. [GRUNTING HEARD] -Let me listen. -Yes. -Ah! Oh. Yerkov, push. Good. Bring it up. Bring them home. Oh, yes. Yes. Yes. -Oh! -Come on. Come on. Just three more times. Oh, just-- RUSSIAN: Oh! PUSHKA TARTSKY: One more. One more thrust. You [INAUDIBLE]. RUSSIAN: Push it, Pushka. Oh, man. Oh! RUSSIAN: I want you to give it all. Come on, push. Push, come on. Come on. Give me everything. [MOANING] Everything. Man, calm down. More. Come on. Make it burn. Make it burn. Come on, push! -Yerkov. -Come on. -Yerkov. -Come on. -Stop-- -Faster. -Stop. -Faster. -Ay. -Faster! No! Push it! PUSHKA TARTSKY: Yerkov. RUSSIAN: Push it out. Come. Come on. Come on. Push it out. PUSHKA TARTSKY: Yerkov. RUSSIAN: Come on. No [INAUDIBLE]. No, [INAUDIBLE]. Come on. Come on. Do it hard. I want it all every day. I give [INAUDIBLE]. Come on! Ah! [LAUGHING] [MOANING] Ah! You're a sick mother fucker. Ah. Pushka, it has never been so good for me. You are the woman of my dreams. I will love you forever. Please tell me you feel the same way. Yerkov, I do. You're the most incredible man I have ever met. I can tell you how happy I am. Well, we have a big job to do tomorrow. We must get some sleep. Goodnight, my little [INAUDIBLE]. Ha, ha. Goodnight, my big Yerkov. [FARTING] [MOANING] Oliver, Barton Oliver. Well? Sir? Yerkov is dead. Dead? Dead. All right! And, uh, what about Tina, our double agent? Well, sir, I'm afraid that she too is gone with the wind. [SIGHS] Where's Roy? Uh, well, Roy will be out for a little while. Ha. OK. Good work. Thank you, sir. Oliver, Barton Oliver. Ay, ay, ay. Good evening, Madam President. Good evening. Sit. Oh, thank you. I have some good news. We can all breathe a little easier. Yerkov is dead. PRESIDENT: All right. And, uh, things are going very well at the safe house. Mm. Bunson and Thesis are just about threw with the calculations needed to launch the orbital missile system. Oh. Wha-- You can look, but don't touch. Yes, ma'am. [SINGING] Interesting. It appears that Bunson and Thesis will be ready by lunch time Friday. Yerkov is dead. That Mongolian, muted Dr. Me has duplicated our poison fart formula. Oh. Things do not look so good for Mother Russia. [INAUDIBLE] OK. But just for a moment. [TINKERING MUSIC] OK. That is enough, Comrade. Hm. We will look like fools if that woman launches her OMS before we even have one. We must stop them. [PHONE DIALING] [RINGING] Hello? President Greenberg here. Hello, Madam [INAUDIBLE]. [MOANING] I hope I'm not interrupting any important affairs of state. Cut the crap, [INAUDIBLE]. What do you want? I think she's having [INAUDIBLE]. You [INAUDIBLE] do it to me, baby. Oh. [INAUDIBLE] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] OK. Madam President, we are willing to sign a peace treaty banning the use of poisonous fluctuates and other potential forms of gastrointestinal warfare, as well as less severe armaments, such as neutron bombs and other nuclear devices, provided [INAUDIBLE] a little [INAUDIBLE] and [INAUDIBLE]. Oh, yeah. How does that sound? How does a big fuck you sound? Oh, I, I give up! I give up! I-- I-- give up! Damn your soul, [INAUDIBLE]. What a disappointment. I was hoping she would confine herself to women's rights and helping to [INAUDIBLE]. [SWISH] [SIGHS] Gudenov, send our best [INAUDIBLE] to the United States. This means war. Do whatever you have to do. [INAUDIBLE] Eh! [INAUDIBLE] Ah. But watch out for the flying farters who may suddenly swoop down out from the sky. [FARTING] [INAUDIBLE] troops are vicious. They won't hesitate to shit in your face or fart your head off! Ow, my head. We must destroy Bunson and Thesis. So tell your men to be careful. Careful. Oh. [INAUDIBLE] The house is heavily guarded. Bunson and Thesis must die! You may have to stick an ass in the back window. [INAUDIBLE]. OK. Just eat the pie-- [FART] [MANIACAL LAUGHING] Ugh. Ugh. [BELL RINGING] Jesus Christ! That's right. Look what's going on, down here. Wait 'til my father hears about this. [SNARE DRUM PLAYING] (SINGING) Men make wars, and wars make men, so we'll do it again, and again, and again. Killing is fun. Killing is right. We a gory battle. We love a bloody fight. I died for this? Lose an arm or a leg. Show [INAUDIBLE] your [INAUDIBLE]. Lose an arm or a leg. You guys are nuts! (SINGING) [INAUDIBLE] for peace. [INAUDIBLE] for [INAUDIBLE]. JESUS CHRIST: I'm going to tell my father. If President Greenberg had signed the treaty, we wouldn't be dying. That was Sophie's choice. I just can't seem to get ahead. Ay, yai, yai. No! No! No! No! N-- oh. God, what a nightmare. Oh. Screw the OMS. This carnage has got to stop! I give up. [DIALING] [OWL HOOTING] [PHONE RINGING] Oliver, Barton Oliver, top secret safe house. Barton? Where are Bunson and Thesis? Bunson! Thesi-- they're right here. PRESIDENT: Are they safe? Yes, of course they are. Thank god. Bring them to me immediately. Course, Madam President. Yo, let's go. Wake up. We're going to the White House. Gentlemen, I have made a decision today. Oh, excuse me, Madam President, but there is something you should know. Madam President, we are very sorry. We tried really hard, but we are nowhere near having the correct frameline to ratio equation. It could be years before we have to correct the variable of the data. The fact is we're decades from being able to launch the orbiting missile system. Decades! A moment, ah, se--seconds. Ha. It's all right, Barton. They tried. You may go now, gentlemen. I must say, Madam President, you're taking this extremely well. Barton. Uh-huh. The Russians have proposed the most all encompassing peace treaty in the history of the world! And I, Sophie Greenberg, am going to sign! [GUNSHOT] Good idea, Madam President. Uh, if you'll excuse me, I have to go, uh, reload. [BOING] Hey! Secret Anti-Fart Treaty. This treaty will ban, as of now and forevermore, the possession or use by either the United States of America, or by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics of the following-- poison fart pills, liquids, and any other poison fart inducing method whatsoever. PRESIDENT: It is also agreed that there will be a permanent ban on all testing-- Whoa. PRESIDENT: -development, and deployment of all anti-poison formulas, as well. As the anti-poison fart fart? The heat seeking fart. And the poison nuclear fart bomb. SOLDIERS (SINGING): Hey! [CHANTING] Oliver, Barton Oliver. [CHANTING] Come in, Barton. [DOOR SLAM] Good evening, Madam President. Good evening. Are you here on official business? Or did you just come to play with my titties? I came to play with your titties. Evict! Evict! Get the way! Get the hell away from my wife. Jaime! I didn't know you cared. Of course I care. I can't play in here with this goddamn noise! I'm very sorry, Mr. Greenberg. But you're going to have to pray somewhere else. Oh! [INAUDIBLE] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Oh! Get out! No! Not the stairs. Not the steps! Not the steps! [SCREAMING] [CRASHING NOISES] Barton. Madam President, hear me out. Now, you must know that my feelings for you are not merely physical, they're patriotic. I care for you very deeply, not just as a person, as a head of state. Oh, I care for you here, in my heart, and I'd like to think that you care for me in your hearts-- heart, this one. [STUTTERING] Oh, I-- I know you think of me as Oliver, Barton Oliver, coldly efficient Chief of III, the most powerful secret agency in the world, but I'm also a man, damn it, and you're the President! Uh, what I mean to say is you've aroused my-- uh, admiration, and I have nothing but the utmost respect for your tremendous ability, Madam President, Sophie. I need, I want-- I want-- I know exactly what you want. And you ain't going to get it, mother fucka! Mhm. Yeah. Some days, you eat the bear. Some days, the bear eats you. That's right, baby. You come with me, because your behind is mine now, sucka. Come on down. [SIGHS] Jaime, is that you? What's happened to you? (SINGING) I've got a new belief. I've got a different view. I found a brand new religion. It's loving you. Loving you-- come with me to the altar of love. Whoa, let me tell you, baby-- let me take you to my altar of love. We'll find salvation there. Let me take you to my altar of love. I'll be the answer to your prayer, because I'm loving you. Come with me to my altar of love. Let me tell you something, baby. Let me worship you. Together, we'll be whole. Let me pray with you, and we save each other's sou-ou-oul. Ow! Love saved each other's souls. 'Cause I'm loving you. Come with me to my altar of love. Whoa, baby! Let me take you to my altar of love. We'll find salvation there. Let me take you to the altar of love. I'll be a-a-a-answer to your prayers. Loving you-- and when salvation comes. Loving you-- oh, when salvation comes. I'll be loving-- when salvation comes, we'll be together! We'll be together in the altar of love. Oh! Yeah-ey-yeah, yeah. PRESIDENT: Wow. [CAMEL NOISES] Mr. Ahab. Mr. [INAUDIBLE]. I expect to have the new formula by 5 o'clock this afternoon. Are you interested? [CAMEL NOISES] Yes, I'm very interested. [COUGHING] Do it. Bring the money to my office by 5 o'clock today. [CAMEL NOISES] [INAUDIBLE]. [LAUGHING] [INAUDIBLE] She has the new formula. Well, I'm going to have to be convinced, Dr. May. Show me a proof. [BEEPING] Yes? Mr. Coogan, from the IRS? Send him in. [DOOR SHUTTING] Smith. Mr. Coogan. Have a seat. Thank you. And how may I help you today? We've completed our review of your tax returns for the past five years, and there are some irreconcilable inconsistencies. Yes. Would you excuse me for just a moment? MR. COOGAN: [INAUDIBLE]. Prove it. Ah. [DOOR SHUTTING] [EXHALE] Mr. Coogan? Internal Revenue Service. [GASP] Ah. [LAUGHING] [GASPING] [FART] [SNIFFING] Remarkable. I didn't hear a thing. You've done it. You're actually done it. It's silent, but deadly. [CLASP UNLOCKING] Here is your cash. [GASPING] Wait here. I never dreamed I'd get rich from fake farts. I always knew this would be my destiny. [LAUGHING] [PHONE RINGING] Mm. Mm, baby, baby, baby, baby. Mm. Hello? The President speaking. Madam President? World domination in a global supremacy can be yours. Ha! Oh. I have in my possession a weapon. Hm. Baby, baby, baby, baby. What kind of weapon? Well, let's just say it's silent but deadly. Are you interested? Very interested. Are you interested? I am very interested. MAN (ON PHONE): Good. Silent, but deadly. The Russians will never know what hit them, baby. Oh! [LAUGHING] No [INAUDIBLE]. They will not even [INAUDIBLE] a hitman! [LAUGHING] [LAUGHING]
