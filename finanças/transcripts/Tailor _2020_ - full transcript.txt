TAILOR Emmanouil... Emmanouil Manios. The General. Pavlos Serpetinis. Cashmere, cashmere, cashmere. Here they are. All dead, Father. Get rid of them finally. He loved checkered fabrics. Argiris Vasiliou, tax officer... General manager. He died... Charalampos. At last, one that is alive. Times have changed. There are times and they always change. Jackpot! Jackpot! Results tomorrow! Shame on them! They can't even have their elevator repaired. Son! I'm sorry, Mr. Karalis, but under the weight of the overdue dept and with your inability to comply with the terms of settlement, we are in the unpleasant position of having to proceed with legal actions. The bank will proceed to confiscate your property. Listen, Mr. Eftyhiou. I founded my shop in 1961. A tailor's shop is still a viable business. Men will always need suits. There are Italian suits that cost 3.000 to 4.000 euros to be made. I can make Neapolitan-style suits for 1.200 euros. I guess, you are aware... that you cannot honor your obligations... nor settle your pending debts now or in the future. Inevitably, your business will have to be repossessed. What are you doing, Nikos? Nikos, what you are asking for is not possible. Still packed. Never opened them. These fabrics were on the market 15 years ago... Who wants them now? Buy them back for half price. You'll make a profit. I am not a charity! Our fathers worked together for a lifetime. They helped each other. Ok, Ok, I'll take two bolts. I was handsome... I'll leave a debt. DO YOU HAVE BREAD? Good morning, Miss Victoria. You forgot your watercolors last night. Oh! And I have a painting class today! -What time is it? -Eight. I'm going to be late. Thanasis, you'll die in there! A new suit! Ready to be a groom? Why not? I am more handsome than you. You're lucky to have your father to make suits for, little Nikos. My son is also an idiot, but... plumbers make money! At least he is not like Thanasis' son. He does what he can. WILL YOU SEW FOR ME TOO? Why didn't you call me immediately? What would you have done? Did you bring bed sheets? No. Hand soap? -I'll get some. -It's too late now. Too late. -Always repeating. -I'm just saying. No, I'm the one saying. The hospital doesn't provide sheets or towels. Papa? Papa? Papa? You will get strong. You'll walk better after. The shop. Nikos, my child, please go. Don't let the shop disappear. Go. Go. Don't worry. Everything will be fine. Don't worry. -How long will he stay here? -Two weeks. Are you ok? What on earth is this construction? What are you doing here? You're supposed to be looking after my father. Tell him I'm going out to get customers. He's lost it. Let's go. -Good morning. -Good morning! How much for the jars? The big ones are 15 euros and the small ones 10. -How much? -I'm also here on Sunday. -Are these with marmalade? -Yes, I make it. -Do you sell them? -You made this? Are you new here? I've never seen you before. Yes. Are those Chinese fabrics? If you don't mind, please.. don't touch anything. Thank you. Your hands. Excuse me. No problem. -Hello. -Hello. You shorten trousers? No. I'm sewing. Suits. How much for a new suit? It depends on the fabric, sir. -What's the occasion? -My brother is getting married. Nice. Will you need it for other purposes? Are suits in your everyday life? At work? I work at a bar, nights. Eh... I'll wear it somewhere. To pay it off. In this case, we can find a fabric quality... ideal for regular wear... without showing signs of deterioration. Which season will you wear it? Now, summer. The wedding is in two weeks. That soon? A suit needs at least three weeks... -and two to three fittings. -Eh, it's just a week less. So... we need to find a light woolen fabric... that will keep you cool. Take a look at these. Woolen and cool? The yarn type, sir, is super 130. Weight: 220 grams. These two weigh the same. Prices start from 140 euros per meter until 450. No cheaper fabrics? The cheapest fabric I have costs 110 euros per meter. How many meters do I need? For your body shape, 3.20. And 30 extra centimeters if you would like turn-ups or pleats. So, 800 - 900 to round up? -Look at this one. -How big are you, man? The fabric you're now holding is cashmere, sir. The wool originates... -in Australia. -No way! You can find sheep everywhere in the world... but it's only in Australia that the microclimate... affects them to such an extent... that the wool is of premium quality. The only part of the animal that is harvested is the one from the neck to the belly. That is, just a small handful from each animal. You understand why it's so expensive? What is all this stuff? Does he sell it or give it away? Hey, Nikos, what are you doing here? Ridiculous! Beat it. What is this for? That's an anti-mold product. -For tiles, for marble... -Is it dangerous? No, not at all. Thank you! You are welcome! Only men's stuff. No womenswear? WHEN WILL YOU GIVE ME A RIDE? What are you doing here? Go inside. Hello. I'm sorry. Good morning, Miss. It's perfect! Bravo, Nikos. You will make it! Why do you need my mum's dress? You only sew suits, don't you? These are amazing! You interrupted us! -Hi, Nikos. -Good morning, Olga. Tomorrow, I am going on a ride in the coach! What coach? in Russian Who is going to do your homework? Pushkin? Go home! I'm sorry about... I'm just trying to learn how to make dresses. I don't... Thank you. You sewed these? You can sew as well, Olga. Yeah, but... I'm not as good as you are. I only know the basics. I want to learn to sew well. Would you like to work here? Move aside! Come on, you clown! Pal, your vehicle rocks. -Need some help? -No, thank you very much. Further up, there's a pedestrian area with a lot more space. -Thank you very much, sir. -No problem. Stay tight. Hey, you! -You selling clothes? -Yes. -Do you sew wedding dresses? -Wedding dresses? My daughter needs a wedding dress! This balcony and one more, I'm done. You wait there- No, I don't sew wedding dresses. I have dresses! Yes, yes. I do! I can sew a wedding dress! I can sew anything your daughter needs! Tomorrow same time? No, this is not my house. Stay there I am coming down. I'll write it down for you. It's 29 Agisilaou Street, Kaminia. Kaminia? That's pretty far. No, it isn't. Only a 30-minute drive. Are you ok? Yes, yes. Fine. Look. It fits me well. Two nights, okay? I'll take good care of your father. Don't worry at all. If you want me to stay for more nights you have to make me more clothes. -Deal? -Okay. Deal. They were out of fabrics I had. Maybe not so good. They are very good, Olga. The stitches are straight... the hem correct. You could sell them. -If you want to. -Oh, I will! Thank you so much. Have you finished your homework? Who is going to do it for you? The tailor can help me. He knows Greek grammar! No back talk, Victoria. Little Miss, bring your books. Let's see if I can help. -Here. -Let's see. Oh, verb tenses. Do you appreciate time, Miss? Yes. -So, present, past continuous, past... -Not all three! Present. I climb, you... Hello, Nikos. Welcome! Thank you for the invitation. Yes, ok. You can sit down. What's up? You'll abandon us now? Start your own career? Oh, please. Seat yourself, Nikos. Thank you very much. -You want a whiskey, Nikos? -No, no, I don't... You'll have a whiskey. Pour him a whiskey-- Forget it. I'll do it. -Careful! -I can reach it. On the rocks, huh? Whiskey should always be drunk on the rocks. Cheers! -Cheers! -The rice. -Thank you, miss. -Bring me the salt. The salt. Got everything we need? -Bring a fork for me, too. -Don't you have a fork? -No. -I am sorry. Who makes tailor-made clothes nowadays anyway? What are you talking about? This tailor can sew everything. Beanies, robes, scarfs, toys, pajamas... My darling! Eat, Nikos. Eat, man. Enjoy your meal. I'm vegan. I don't eat steaks. Do you want some orange juice? -How about exchanging drinks, Miss? -Okay. Watch the way you eat. Hold it tightly. I forgot to tell you... My partner in the taxi is leaving. On top of everything else... I've thought about it, though. I will buy his share. Don't worry about money. I'll find it. She can cook, eh? -Yes, it's delicious. -Thanks. Well, Nikos, listen. Olga, doesn't need money, you know. No, no... I asked her to help me. To teach me women's fashion. She's good, I know that. But who's gonna buy them, I don't know. Good morning! Good morning! Come in, come in. This way. This way. Come. Welcome! This is Sissy. -Your hair up, please? -Yes. Thank you. My size is extra small. There are no sizes in tailoring, Miss. Have you sewn a wedding dress before? No. Why can't I have a proper seamstress? Sissy, you'll have the most beautiful wedding dress. He's the best in Athens. Classy. You get me? So, I want it strapless... tight over this part and full of rhinestones up here. Like Swarovski. I want it to have a huge skirt. and a very long train. -It won't look nice on you! -Why? For your body type, the best choice would be... a long narrow dress. It'd make you look taller. -He called me short. -We want a large skirt, okay? A large skirt, you hear me? How much will it cost? 800 euros. 800? -Yeah, right... Ok, 200 euros? -We should buy a readymade one. It takes time! It's a wedding dress. Silk is expensive. Silk? It can be fake. Won't it still be good? -Let's say 600 then. -600? 400, final offer. -Hello. -Welcome. Straight from Paris? Yves Saint Laurent? No, from Lausanne. Tell me. Is it your first time here? Where are you from? -The center of Athens. -Are you married? No. So...You're a Pisces with Virgo horoscope. Yes! -There she goes again! -Is this one good? -How many miles do you hit per hour? -As many as it reads. Are these all the sizes you have? The hitch, have you installed it yourself... -or did you go to a garage? -Myself. Do you only sell dresses? -I can make anything you like. -Can you make me rich? I can sew you a dress with big pockets. This is very nice! Let me change your gasket. This one is leaking oil. I saw you at Halina's. You're making her daughter's wedding dress. -How are you? -Take care of her. Bye. Such nice things. My cousin is getting married. She doesn't have much money. -Will you come by our work? -Yes. At the nursing home. When does she need it? Later, one or two months. -There's a difference. -Make it fast, it stays cheap, eh? Fast is not cheaper! And I want this dress. Eight euros. Twenty. For you. Eight. Twenty. -Ten! -Fifteen, we have a deal. -Ten. -Fifteen. All right. Thank you very much. Me too. -See you. -Goodbye. It's wonderful! But it doesn't have the enormous skirt she asked for. What? But it is big. It's big, but not enormous. It would be a mistake. Never enough for the brides, trust me. The tailor is right! If the skirt is bigger, the bride won't be able to kiss the groom! She's right. I'm not vegan anymore. I can't hear what you say. I can't hear. Cut according to the cutout. I want to try something new. I'll follow the cutout. You need to advertise yourself! CLOSED I told you to call first! Katerina! My cousin. She cleans here. Look who I brought to you! This way. Here. I've brought more dresses for you to choose from. Oh, nice! And now the bride. Thank you. -Here. -Thank you. Do you like it? -Beautiful. What a nice color! -Thanks. -Excuse me. -About what? -Here. -Thank you. -I want a pretty dress. -You're going to be gorgeous. How aristocratic! -It's very nice. -I'll wear this at your wedding. Girl! Well... I'm done here. How much? With the discount we were talking about. So... 200 euros and these medicines. Why are you trying so hard? I am not vegan anymore. Guys! You've surrounded me with your food. Yeah... I asked you to put something up here, Mr. Nikos. It's too plain. Add some rhinestones. -Right, Mom? -Yes, something flashy. The tablecloth? Cut it, cut it. Perfect! It's perfect! -I can do this myself. -I know. You don't even answer the phone anymore. The bank called me. Time is passing. Can you, please, bring me my pill box near the stove? So many years of work... and you are running around the city like a charlatan. You think I haven't heard? You're embarrassing me. I'm working, Father! That's what I'm doing. Wedding dresses are for seamstresses. We are tailors. I'm also sewing, Father. You sew. But what do you sew! I'm sewing, Father. I'm sewing.

Thank you very much! You wrapped it for me, thank you! Twenty-five euros, final offer. I'm not paying that. I'll tell my father then to cancel his cancer treatment. Yeah, right. Ten euros. Papa! Papa! This woman doesn't... Okay, okay! Twenty. I won! These are for you. What's this? Fresh from the sea! That's ridiculous. Nikos! You want people to pay you actual money. He hasn't got it, what can I do? Sell them cheaper. But don't let them bargain. They'll mock you if you lower the prices. Just a thread. Do you hear me? Time for dinner, Victoria. I'm not hungry. Time for homework then. Sweetheart. Thank you. It's perfect, perfect! Maybe you would like it more pink? But it is pink. You can't get any fresher. And 200 euros! Agreed! Hello, my friend Nikos! What's up? Pour gas, 20 euros. -Fine? -Yes. Check this out! You are in the streets, too. I bought the whole share. I own the entire taxi now. Congratulations. Olga's been telling me about the wedding dresses! She's working around the clock for you. She'll become the breadwinner in the end. Shall I treat you to a coffee? Nah. Not the season for treats. You don't come by for dinner anymore. Congratulations! Come on, kiss him! Okay, I'll kiss him! Relax! She'll kiss him! Bravo! We wish you a happy life! Come here, Mr. Tailor! Let me introduce you to my friends. We made the wedding dress. Turn around. Let him see you. May you have a happy life! Take care of him! Let's dance. -Are you okay? -I'm fine mom. Don't worry. Let's go! Couldn't you make a better dress? That's what she wanted. Shall we? -A grandchild soon! -Don't rush them! Let's dance. I was 14 years old... when one day my father told me, "Nikos... we're going to a fine restaurant". "Let's go," I said. "Yes, but you can't go like that. You should wear a suit". Seriously? Fourteen years old. He took me to the shop, chose a fabric for me... and he made me my first suit. Really? When I was 16... I started working in the shop and learned how to sew. From here, you can see my island. In the far distance, you can see the mountains. Yes, I see it. That's where we spent summers. We still have the house. We wouldn't be able to sew wedding dresses there. Why? We'll have to go back to suits. Only funerals now. What's up, Victo? Let go of me! You aren't talking to me anymore? Have you done your homework? What's gotten into you? You're quitting school? You should quit night shifts! "Immediate repossession." Nikos! Come in, Nikos. Sit down. No, no... I haven't cooked. It's okay. You'll make something. Attention, ladies and gentlemen... the famous race "Taxi versus Coach" starts now! -Stop it! -Don't you yell at me! The key doesn't fit. Try the other one. Come in. Let me do it. Come, father. Bring me my pattern. Can I see it? It's extraordinary. What are you thinking about? You. I need a jacket! -How about sewing one together? -Yes.
