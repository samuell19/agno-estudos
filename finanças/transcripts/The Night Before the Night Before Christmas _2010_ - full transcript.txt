Two minutes to departure. Two minutes. Oh, dear! I'm late! Two minutes, only two minutes. You are fine, sweetheart, you have plenty of time. Two minutes is not "plenty of time", Mrs. Claus. Now why are you so anxious? Everything is going to be fine and you know it. I don't know, my dear. That's just it. Something just doesn't feel right. Nonsense. You've done this thousands of times. What could go wrong? Uh... Nothing I supppose. Of course not. Now I put a thermos of hot cocoa under the seat, because-- The first rule of winter: put something warm on the inside... ...so you won't feel cold on the outside. You take such good care of me. Am I wrong, my dear, or did this year pass by faster than usual? They say time passes faster the older you get. And you, my darling, are positively ancient. What does that make you, Mrs. Claus? A gentleman isn't supposed to notice a lady's age. This gentleman never does. Time to go, Santa. It's time to go. Such a taskmaster, our Nigel. Be safe, my darling. I'll be back before you know I'm gone. Santa. It's time. Come along! Yes! One minute to departure, one minute. My beauties! What? What is it? My map. I don't have it. You don't?! I was sure I gave it to you. Don't tell me I forgot it. Maybe I dropped it. Oh! Hah! Here it is! I had it all the time. Silly me. No harm done. Now remember... First stop: New Zealand. Where midnight begins its journey around the globe. You know, I still can't believe how fast this year went by. Yes, yes, time flies. And now so do you. Off we go! - Up, up and away! - Quite right, Nigel! Here we go! All clear! Goodbye, my love! To the sky! Mrs. Clause! What was that? Everything seems fine. I'm sure it was nothing. "December 24th, 2010. 6:00 p.m. Eastern time. Santa departs on schedule." There you go. Another Christmas set in motion. Max. Max, Max, Max, Max and Max. All the Maxs'. Not enough. I need more. Hannah? Hannah! Can't you see I'm in an important conversation? I'm collecting Christmas presents for the Christmas Hope Foundation, but I don't have enough yet. And this matters to me, why? 'Cause you can't expect Santa Claus to give us stuff if we're not willing to give stuff to other people. Okay, you are not gonna believe this. My little brother's gone all bono on me trying to collect for charity. Yeah, he's playing the Santa card to make me feel guilty. Can you believe it?! Are you still here? Please. Okay. Hold on. I didn't like it anyways. You happy? Good. Bye! Mom? In a second, Toby! I'm just getting some prints out of the bath! Okay. Okay. Mom and dad. Now Hannah. And then me. It's a family photo. Well... kind of. Gorgeous. These are just gorgeous. I think this is probably the best work I've ever done. And if my boss doesn't think so, then he's just crazy. So what's up with my favorite little man? The truck from the Christmas Hope Foundation Is coming in the morning, And I was wondering if you had anything you'd like to donate. I think that's wonderful what you're doing, Toby. And I would certainly love to donate something. Not sure what just now, but I'll think of something. Okay? But right now I think we should go and figure out what we're gonna have for dinner, 'Cause daddy's gonna be home any minute. Come on. Guys?! Hey. Hey. - How was your day? - Oh, don't ask. It was murder. You're lucky you work at home. First of all, the office fax machine breaks down, then my secretary calls in sick, and the internet decides to stop working for some reason. And then you know what? To top it all off, I've got a jetstream and a King Air on the ground in Bakersfield, both of them need fuel pumps. I found a couple in the L.A. Warehouse, but, you know, try getting a delivery company to pick up the phone, two days before Christmas. I've been on hold for like an hour. Hey ya, sport, how was your day? Pretty good, I guess. Cool. What's in the box? Stuff for the Christmas Hope Foundation. Do you have anything you'd like to donate? Absolutely! I just can't think of what right now. Can we do this later? Sure, dad. Hey, Wayne! You still with me, buddy? Yeah. I'm still here. You left me on hold forever. Now where were we? Wow! A shooting star! I get to make a wish! Okay, okay... I wish my family would come together and have a great Christmas this year. Oh, and I wish it would snow too. Wouldn't be much of a Christmas without snow. Come on, let's have some pizza. I think it's your favorite - "Meat lovers". It right to Davis... to drive Okay, this is for you. You know, I can't even think about eating until I get out of these work-clothes. They smell like the dark room. You be all right by yourself for a minute, kiddo? Sure, mom. What was that? Is that coming from the roof? That's what it sounds like. What do you suppose that was? I don't know. A tree branch maybe? Oh, ah, uh... Oh. Oh. So who do you think he is? Looks like one of those mall Santas. What would a mall Santa be doing up on our roof? I don't know. Maybe he's really into his job? Well, you got me, honey. Look... Don't you think maybe we should take him to emergency? I mean, what if he's hurt? He doesn't appear to have any injuries. That's true. Hey, mom! I know who this is. You do? Who? It's Santa Claus. Uh... Gee, sport, I don't know about that. It is. Well, you never know, right? Hey, who's the old geezer on the couch? It's Santa Claus! What? It's Santa Claus! Okay, get serious. Even if it was Santa Claus, it's not like he'd be here the night before the night before Christmas, hello? Oh yeah? Well, you never know. Right, mom? That's right, honey. You never know. Actually we don't know who he is. He was up on the roof and then he just... He fell off. He fell off, huh? Yeah. Well, how do you know, he's not an alien, who crash-landed on our roof, took the shape of a nice old man, just to put us at ease, and as soon as we let our guard down he's gonna cut open our head with a laser beam and eat our brains out? It could happen. Is there any creature on this planet more bizarre than a teenage girl? - I heard that. - I certainly hope so. She's got a point though. I mean, we really need to figure out who he is and what he's doing here. Well, why don't we wait till he wakes up and then we ask him. Problem solved. Okay, you two go finish eating, I'll take the first watch. There you go Santa. Nice and cozy. I'm sure, he is nice and warm now. But you still haven't eaten. Come on, let's go get you some pizza. Hey, Bradley. Yes, I'm back. No, no, no, just a minor kind of Christmas-family related thing. Oh, right, Santa Claus. Frank? No, that's not it. Cecil? Neh, Cecil, huh. Tim? Tim? Santa can't remember his name. I can see that. Henry? Guiseppe? Come sta, Guiseppe? Bob? Edward. Frederick? Fred? Freddy! Hey, sport, do you want to go upstairs and get dressed so your mom and I can have a talk with our guest here? Oh, uh... okay. Um, be right back, Santa. Oh, oh, oh, yes. All right, Toby. Toby. Now that's a nice name. It's not mine though. Hello there, we're Toby's parents. I'm Wayne Fox. This is my wife, Angela. Yes, Wayne and Angela, of course. Toby's been telling me all about you. It's a pleasure to meet you both. How are you feeling? Well, uh, aside from not remembering who I am, or where I am, or how I got here... I couldn't be better. Where am I, by the way? 223 Oak Road. - Milwaukee. - Milwaukee. - Wisconsin. - Wisconsin. Milwaukee, Wis... I'm sorry. It doesn't ring any bells either, I'm afraid. How I did get here? Well, we were kinda hoping that you would tell us. Well, yeah, well, uh... I distinctly remember waking up on your couch. Before that... Pzzt, nothing. That's actually not surprising, 'cause you took quite a nasty tumble from our roof. I was on your roof? That's me as distinctly odd! What do you suppose I was doing up on your roof? That's another thing we were hoping that you could tell us. - Yes. - Oh, I see. Well, I... I'm almost sure I was up there for a good reason... just can't seem to think what it might have been. Toby thinks it's because you're Santa Claus. Santa Claus. Yes. He keeps calling me that for some reason. But I don't think that's my name either. No. Of course not. Well, then... I'll just have to go back and keep trying to remember. Rob? James? Joel? Michael? All right, what do we got? Snow boots. Skates. Hamburger phone... ooh... What's this...? Well, Merry Christmas to you too. All right. Red velvet sack... Full of presents. That's a nice touch. I guess, he hit his head harder than we thought, huh? No kidding. Which is why I think we should get him to the emergency room. Can you take him? Me? No. My phone might go off at any time. Look, I got a plane on the ground I can't be stuck in some emergency room. They might make you turn your phone off. I guess I could drop him off outside the front door. - No, we can't do that. - Then you've got to take him. I still have to get the perfume ad into the agency by 5:00. Added to which, I have to do all the Christmas shopping this morning, and we still don't even have a tree. What do you mean we don't have a tree? We don't have a tree. What? You mean you haven't noticed? Yeah, yeah, I noticed. We don't have a tree where there should be a tree. Okay, yes. We don't have a tree, we don't have presents, we still have to get the old guy down to the E.R. - How are we gonna handle that? - Like responsible adults. Good. - Odds or evens? - Evens. One, two, three, shoot! One more time. Two out of three. No, no, not, a not a chance, Lance. I win. For some reason I really like sugar. If I tell you what I want for Christmas, do you think you'll remember? Yes, of course I will. Well, what I really want is a puppy. A german shepherd or a spaniel maybe. It doesn't really matter. I've got a name picked out and everything. - Max. - Max. That's an excellent name. I wish it was mine. But that's probably not gonna happen, 'cause my parents always say we'll go to the pound... to get a puppy, but they never get around to it. So, I guess I'd like... A Superspeed Raceway instead. For my Nintendo DS. Mmm hmm. Well... I suppose that's good too. Whatever it is. No, not enough sugar. Will you look at that! It's real velvet. It's handmade, too! Where'd you get it? Out on Oak Road. I hadn't found there with somethin' this nice! The things some people throw away! All right. It is time to say goodbye to Santa, Toby. Goodbye? What do you mean, dad? Uh, I mean, it's time for uh... Santa to go back to the North Pole. But why can't he stay here? Well, because he's got to get his memory back, right? And there are people at the North Pole that can help him. Oh. I never thought of that. Come on. So then he'll be back, right? Yeah, of course he will. In what? 15-16 hours? - Right, Santa? - Absolutely! We're friends now, Toby. That's what friends do. They come back, right? Okay, but when you come back, don't be afraid to wake me up, all right? You got it. Well... I guess this is goodbye for now then. Goodbye, Toby. I'm very glad to have met you. You are quite a wonderful young man. And Angela! It has been a distinct pleasure. A thousand thank yous for all your many kindnesses. It was my pleasure... Santa. I would say goodbye, but apparently I'm coming back in 15 or 16 hours. You are? Yeah, the Santa-thing, he's coming back. Oh right. Good morning, ma'am. Pardon the intrusion, but have you seen-- Santa! You're here! You're here! And you're all right. Thank heavens! I was so worried. So worried. I used the GPS system on your sleigh to track you to this neighbourhood. You can't imagine how many houses there are. I knocked on every door. You know this gentleman? I should think so! I've only been working for him for 207 years, young lady. I told you he was Santa Claus! I knew you were Santa Claus all along. And you were right, apparently. And we have this fine fellow to thank for it. I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch the name. My name? Don't you recognize me?! It's me! Nigel! Nigel Thumb! I'm your head elf. Well, it's a pleasure to meet you, Nigel Thumb! He fell off the roof. I think he landed on his head. Yeah, he doesn't remember anything before this morning. No. Santa lost his memory? Oh... This is a catastrophe! Do you have any idea what this means?! No. It means... I've single-handedly destroyed Christmas. This is all my fault! All my fault! I'm so stupid! I don't deserve to be head elf! Now, now, Nigel. I'm the one who fell off the roof of these nice people, not you. Although what I was doing on a roof in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in the first place, I couldn't say. That's because you weren't supposed to be in Wisconsin yet. You were on your way to New Zealand! I mistakenly used the last year's datebook and sent you out a full 24 hours early. Okay, I can't believe I'm gonna ask this, but... What's the big deal? The big deal is the Christmas magic! Only works one day a year: Christmas Eve! Any other time nothing works properly! Reindeer can't fly right, Santa's bag can't refill itself! Of course, that's it! Santa's bag! That'll jog his memory! Quick! Where's the bag! He didn't have a bag. Are you sure? Red velvet, gold trim. - Sorry. - No. Maybe it's still on his sleigh! Of course, his sleigh! Good work, Toby. Well, unfortunately, we haven't seen a sleigh either. - Are you sure? - Oh yeah. Cherry red, rocket-like carriage. Attached to eight reindeer? This is Wisconsin. We don't have reindeer. If I might uh... a suggestion... Perhaps when I took my tumbled out of the sleigh, the reindeer kept going on to New Zealand without me. No, no. They would never leave you, Santa, never. Really? Such loyal beasts. Yes. But the question still remains: Where are they? Hey, mom! Wow! It's really them! Come. Oh, my goodness. Toby, don't get too close! Not to worry. They love children. They... How did we not see that we had eight reindeer in our backyard? Well, I guess we were distracted by the "Santa Claus" we had in our living room. It's really them! Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, and Vixen. They remember you! Yes, they certainly seem to. Would that I could remember them. Ho, ho. The bag's not here! I can't find it. It should be right here. The altimeter. Where's the altimeter? I think I found it. - What's wrong? - I broke it! That's all I need. Thing is toast all right. Wait a minute, why does your sleigh have an altimeter anyway? Because if you get too high, the air gets too thin and the... the reindeer drop out of the sky like rocks. Ah, of course. I should've known. Well, that's it. Without the altimeter, there's no way to fly the sleigh! My dad can fix it. He used to fix airplanes every day! Uh, I'm sorry, son. There's nothing I can do with this thing. Look it's, it's a goner. There's gotta be something you can do, dad. Well, I could try and get a new one delivered. You can? Oh bless you, Wayne Fox! You do that while I continue to look for the bag. It might be in the yard somewhere. Yeah, I'll do my best, but... Maybe it fell in the bushes. That was a good idea. No it wasn't. Now I gotta go find an altimeter. You do that. I'm gonna go pet the reindeer. Why do we have reindeer in our backyard? Oh, that. We bought them for Toby 'cause we like him best. You did?! I knew it! I'm kidding, Hannah. The reindeer belong to... you know, that guy, Santa Claus. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to order a new altimeter for his sleigh. Santa's sleigh has an altimeter? Yeah, of course it does! What do you think keeps the reindeer from dropping out of the sky like rocks, huh? This family is so weird. I must have been adopted. I'll go check thze front of the house! You might have dropped the bag when you fell off the roof! Excellent idea, Nigel. Hello there. You must be Hannah. Delighted to meet you. Likewise. Big thrill for both of us. Two questions: who's the leprechaun? And does he have a pot of gold? He's an elf. And his name is Nigel. Hmm, figures. I bet they're hungry! I'm gonna get them something to eat. Good idea, Toby. They're hungry. I'm gonna go get them some granola. - Okay, mom? - Okay, sweetheart. So that guy's supposed to be the real Santa Claus, huh? I think I should call you... Sleepy. Gee, I thought he'd be fatter. Of course he's not Santa. We don't know exactly who he is... Yet. You can be Goofy and you... you can be bBb. You know he kinda looks like? The Santa they used to have at Macy's. Except that guy was way better. What the heck am I doing? I'm ordering an altimeter for Santa's sleigh? I must be out of my mind. Let's see what's in this bag. Oh! Ha! Oh. Oh wow! Oh, my goodness... Wow! What is going on here? They sure like grenola, don't they? Oh! Now look, you've got your antlers all tangled up. Why don't you go help your brother? Well, maybe just a little bit. Here you go, Sleepy. That's a good boy. Hey Tob, can I try? You culd try with sugar, too. Here. No, no, no, don't be rude. Hey. There's something I never thought I'd see again. - Well, you know what they say. - What? Inside every cynical, self-absorbed teenager beats the heart of a little girl, who can't resist large furry animals. Bad news. No bag. I couldn't find it anywhere. Well, at least we have the altimeter coming, right? Yeah, it's-- It's on its way. Uh, from Chicago. It should be here in about three hours. But that's just an estimate though, because, you know, the delivery company's kind of busy this year with, you know, all the Christmas stuff. Christmas stuff. Of course! That's how we'll jog Santa's memory! I must say I really appreciate all of this effort. It's very strange not knowing who you are or what you're supposed to be doing. Well, we're gonna fix that, right now, with this! Wayne! A popcorn garland. I made it... I don't how many years ago. You remember this, Santa? Popcorn? Absolutely! It's my favorite snack. Buttered, of course. Love it with a good movie. - No. - Hannah! I can't not believe I'm even doing this. Hey, Santa! See the pretty angel! And it's all coming back to you now? Uh, no. Toby, you're up! Hey Santa, look! It's my stocking! I hang it from the mantelpiece and you put stuff in. Remember? Uh... No. I promise you'll have it by 5:00. I'm in the darkroom as we speak. Yeah. Bring back any memories? No. Sorry. Well, this isn't working! There's got to be a better way. There's got to be. I've got it. Everyone ready? Okay, Toby and Wayne first. On the... * First day of Christmas * * My true love sent to me, * * A partridge in a pear tree * All right, now Hannah and Angela. * On the second day of Christmas * * My true love sent to me * * Two turtle doves, * * And a partridge in a pear tree * Not exactly America's most talented, but I see real potential. Let's try something else! "Jingle bells"! That's a great idea! But, you know, I'm-- I'm really not much of a singer and I think that my talents could be put to better use maybe, gosh, getting a tree? Well, I suppose a tree would be nice. Well, you know, I think maybe you should try, while I'm gone. Maybe baking cookies. Because, really nothing smells more like Christmas than freshly-baked shortbread cookies. Why don't you stay here and bake cookies! I'll get the tree? 'Cause I called it first. I... Wait! I'm coming with you! Want to come? Really? Please drop me off at Katie's. Katie's? Yeah, I promised her and her mom I help them make fudge today. Oh, I see. You can't leave! You promised you'd help save Christmas! No, mom and dad promised, not me. I'm out of this loony bin. Oh yeah? Well, when Santa gets his memory back, I'm gonna tell him not to give you anything for Christmas! Ooh, and I'm so scared. What are you gonna do next? Hannah! Bad-mouth me to the Easter Bunny or the Tooth Fairy? Don't be upset, sweetheart. That was just... - Hannah being Hannah. - I know. Look, you go back to work with Santa and I'll be back in half an hour with the best tree in all of Milwaukee. Deal? That's my guy. Save me some cookies. What do you think, Tobes? That shortbread cookie idea, it sounded pretty good to me. - Yeah, I guess. - Yeah? 'Cause you know what? Even if we don't jog Santa's memory, at least we'll have some delicious cookies to eat, right? Come on! Let's make some cookies! - Done! - Hey, Yolanda! This here is Hank from... what were you...? "Toys for Tots". Understand you got a few items for pick up. Well, I guess that all depends on what you mean by "a few". Well, I'll be. You know, Hannah, if you wanted to make fudge you could've asked me. I didn't want to bother you. I would've been happy to make fudge with you. Okay, I didn't come here to make fudge. - You didn't? - No. I came over here because Katie's family has a real Christmas every year. We play games, watch Christmas movies like "It's a Wonderful Life". Really? And how long have you been doing that? The last three years. And you never mentioned it to me? Why? Christmas isn't a big deal for you. I mean, I figured I was doing you a favor. One less thing to distract you from your work. - Oh Hannah, that's not fair. - Isn't it? You're gonna tell me that it's not true? You know what you got me for Christmas last year? A hamburger phone. Well, I thought you would think it was cool. Yeah, because you saw it in some movie about a teenager. What I really wanted was a camera. - You wanted a camera? - Yeah. I thought that maybe we could take pictures together... sometime or something. Oh god. Hannah, I had no idea. Gee, really? Like there's a total shock. You "had no idea"? I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that. It's okay, honey. You're right. I know I'm not the world's most perfect mom. I focus too much on my work. And I know that's hard on you and Toby. But I am trying to do the right thing. I really am. It's just that I get- I just get distracted and I forget. You know, I lose sight of what's important and I'm beginning to realize that now, and if there's anyone, who should say they're sorry, Hannah, it's me. and I really, really... and you're texting? Why are you texting? I told Katie that I can't come. I told her that I'm going to buy a Christmas tree... with my mother. You know what? I think have a knack for this. Now pack it into a ball. You know what? I'm gonna let the machine pick that up. It's kind of like uh... Packing a snowball here. Oh oh oh! That's not gonna make the cookies taste very good. You know, at this late date, I thought we were gonna be stuck with all the scrawny kind of loser-trees, but these are-- they're not bad. Hey, look at this one. This is nice and full. It still has some life to it. What do you think? Do you like it? It's pretty good. Okay, I guess we'll be taking this one then. Do you see the guy? - I don't see the guy. - Hey, mom. Do remember that tree we had one year? It was so tall it almost touched the ceiling? Sure, I remember that. And daddy hoisted you up on his shoulders, so you could put the star up on the top. Well... I think that's the one. Cookie dough, take two. - This time no playing around. - Excellent. Uh, now roll it into a sheet of dough. All right, all we need is a roller then. And we're gonna need some Christmas cookie cutters, to make the shapes. We could always create our own shapes! - Oh! - There we are. Can't thank you enough, Yolanda. You just made Christmas a whole lot better for a whole lot of deservin' kids. Well, if you find you need any more presents just... reach inside this. Merry Christmas, Hank! Yes, Tucker, I got your message. Yeah, Bluestar, biggest client, nine jets. Why are you telling me what I already know here? My attitude? Come on, I can do this from home, you know that. Okay, calm down. Tucker, relax. All right. All right, Tobes, let's get to that tree! Now that is what I call a Christmas tree. Look at them. You got it all lit up! Okay, you take the low branches, I'll take the high branches here. I guess I'll get started on the... light ball. Good luck with that. So, how's the tree working for you so far, Santa? Oh, uh, nothing yet, but I must say, it's a magnificent specimen! Well, maybe when it's all decorated. Mmm hmm. Here we go! Fresh from the oven! Ooh! Take a whiff of these lovelies, Santa. Oh, delightfully aromatic! Mmm! Well? Anything? Nothing so far, but uh... I shall persevere until memory dawns. Cookie, Hannah? Not in this or any other lifetime. On second thought, I'd love one, Nigel. Thank you. I, uh, I better get that, but I'll be back in 60 seconds, all right? Time me. All right! Let's get to work on that tree! Toby, I want you and Nigel to get busy with the lights. Hannah, you and I are-- Hello? Yes, Rick. Well, how about I scan you what I have and then I can e-mail it to you. Five minutes, tops. No, the color won't be great, but at least you'll get a general idea Of what it's gonna look like. Well, five minutes isn't so bad. Except it usually means 25 minutes. Yeah, if we're lucky. You know what? For a second, I thought maybe things might be different this Christmas. Man, was I stupid. This is gonna be some Christmas. Hey, hey, hey, guys, listen to this! One pair of snow boots, ice skates, hamburger phone... a-and a red velvet sack with gold trim! This is the receipt for my donation! That's where the bag is! The Christmas Hope Foundation took it! Toby, let me see that. This must be where it is! So there really is a bag? Of course there is. But then... Does that mean that you guys are for real? Of course it does! No way. No. Shall I tell you what you wanted for Christmas, when you were... Seven years old? I don't even remember that. Actually... I do remember that. What did I want, Mr. Christmas? Oh my god! Oh my god, you guys are so real! Toby, they are so real! Well, of course they are! Whatever happens, you keep that to yourself, okay? Come on, Hannah. We've gotta tell dad we know where the bag is! Okay, let's go! Dad, dad, we found the bag! Th-That's great, Toby, just hold on a minute here. Yeah, on the Lear, H99... You should have gotten them by now, Rick. I sent them five minutes ago. Well, did you check to see if they got sent to your spam folder? Mom! Mom, we found the bag! It's at the Christmas Hope Foundation! We're gonna go get it, okay? That's fine. That's great, kids. I'll be up in a minute, okay? You heard what she said. Let's go. How's that? Resend them. Just give me a minute. They said yes. Well, they sort a said yes in a-- "I'm too busy to deal with it" kind of way, but that's good enough for me. Well then? Let's go get Santa's bag back! Yes! Tally ho! Ha ha ha! Yes, yes, yes. I realize that's the part for the King Air 200, but it also fits the 300. The KDL part, yeah. Yeah, that's the two-- Just read the number back to me, Murph. Yeah. Two more minutes, guys! What did you want for Christmas, when you were seven years old? Oh, like I'm really gonna tell you. That's between me, Nigel and Santa Claus. Excuse me, young man? Santa and his elf. Okay, uh, see looking all fine for the big day. Why thank you! And feeling fine as well! We're looking for a bag, red velvet, gold trim? Picked up on Oak Road this morning? Full of presents! Oh, that was yours! My bad. Uh, yeah, yeah, we do have that bag. Thank heavens! Can you tell us where it might be? You'd have to ask Yolanda. She's right over there. Excuse me. I'm told you have a bag full of presents that belongs to me? I promise, Rick. Yeah, 5:00. Okay, before 5:00. Right, bye. How'd you do? Not bad, you? Taking care of business. Okay, where is everybody? Uh... Hannah? Hello? Any luck? No, not anywhere, they're gone! Look around for a note. Maybe we missed it. I'm in a call for Hannah's cell. Oh wait, wait, wait! I've got a text message. "Bag at Christmas Hope Foundation. Went to get it." They're at the thrift store! They went on their own! Well, no, technically-speaking, they went with Santa Claus and his head elf. Not comforting. Did they say anything about this to you? Might have, I don't know. I was busy. Did they say anything to you? Maybe, I don't remember. It's Hannah. Hannah, where are you? Are you okay? The what? It's where? The Fantasy Fair? Okay, well look, you just stay put and we'll come and get you. No, sweetie, we're not mad at you. You just should have left a note or... The guy you looking for is named "Hank". He's this old dude with a white beard, and he's really skinny. He's working for "Toys for Tots". Yolanda says he took the bag to the Christmas festival at the Fantasy Fair. Yeah, that'd be his last stop. Where are we going? You sure you don't mind giving us a ride? What, you kidding me? Santa always hooked me up, when I was a kid. I'll be honoured to do the big man a solid. There you go. Yuletide brother number one. Excellent! Hello! We've made some wonderful new friends! Things are looking up! Are you okay? We're fine, mom. We tried to tell you where we were going... I know, and we were too busy to listen and that's wrong. Well, we're sorry, and that's not ever gonna happen again, okay? Is that a promise? Yes, that's a promise. Pinky promise? Pinky promise. Hey folks? I can see the "Toys for Tots" truck in my mirror. It's back there. Hey, are you Hank? Sure am. Yolanda Davis from the Christmas Hope Foundation told us that she gave you a big red bag. Well, she surely did all right. Excellent news! Now if you'd be so kind as to return the item, we would be eternally grateful! Well, I'd surely like to, only some feller in a santy suit just asked me to borrow it. They got a santy contest goin' on inside and he was bagless. Well, what could I do? But, young man, we really need to have that bag! Not if you ask me, you don't. I've seen some of them fellers in the contest. Bag or no bag, you got 'em beat. Oh, well, I thank you very much. Excuse me. Good luck, oldtimer! My money's ridin' on you! Oh my. This is not good. Now, kids, you've seen five Santas. What do you think? You like what you see?! Hey, look at that guy! Okay, okay, I've got it! Here's what we do: We enter you in the contest. You get up onstage with those other bozos and sneak a peek in the bags. Yeah, but how will I know which bag is the right bag? You'll know. Trust me. Magic? Bingo! Come on. Registration's over here! Mom, you're not gonna believe this, but Santa and Nigel are real. Oh. I'm serious. Nigel knew exactly what I asked Santa for when I was seven years old! Hannah! Please, do not make this any more complicated, than it already is. I'm serious. I know, sweetheart. Hello, I would like to enter the contest along with these other bozos. You have the winner, right here. Too late. Sorry. What do you mean it's too late? What I mean we got 20 guys already, which is five more than what we really need. Any more than that, we're gonna be here all night. And I'd really like to see my family for Christmas Eve, if that's okay with you guys? Oh, that's perfectly okay with us! Of course-- It's just-- This is a matter of considerable importance. See... I really need to see inside those bags. And I said, sorry. No can do. Now, beat it! Am I making myself clear? Perfectly, yes. Disqualified, I'm afraid, on technicality. Well, now what? I'm telling you, "now what"! The gloves are comin' off! That big oak doesn't know who he's dealing with! Wait here. I'll be right back. Be careful, Nigel! I'm not the one, who needs to be careful! He's a remarkable little guy, isn't he?! Hey, Goliath! Meet your David! You messed with the wrong elf, pal! I demand to see inside those bags now! Am I making myself clear?! Hmm? Is that yours? No, no, that's gotta be yours. It's mine. Hello? - Yeah. - Yes. Yeah, I know. Yeah, I know. They'll be finished soon, Toby. Don't worry. This always happens! They're going to leave us and go back to their jobs again! You don't know that for sure. Yes I do, Hannah, and you know it too! They always put their work ahead of us! Not this time. They pinky-promised, remember? They don't care about promises! They don't care about Christmas! They don't care about us! They don't care about anything but their stupid jobs! Toby! Tucker wants me in the office like now. Rick wanted the proofs five minutes ago. What are we gonna do? I don't know. This is a tough one. Mom, dad, Toby's gone. What do you mean Toby's gone? He ran off. He saw you guys on your cellphones and he figured, you know, like always. He got really upset. Well, which way did he go? That way. Toby! Toby! - Toby! - Toby! Toby! Let's split up so we can cover more ground. Make sure you check all the rides! Okay. Let's go! Put me down! Do any idea what you're doing?! I sent Santa out on the wrong day! Christmas is in jeopardy! Don't make me get rough! Put! Me! Down! You haven't heard the last of Nigel Thumb! Barbarians. Hey, there! I've been lookin' all over for you. He is not in the arcade. Let's uh... Let's try down here. Hannah? Hannah. Are you okay, sweetie? What's wrong? I was just thinking. What if Toby ran away 'cause of me? No. No, sweetie, Toby's upset with me and your mother, all right? Not with you. I haven't been much help. Always being mean to him, bossing him around, telling him to get lost. I haven't been a very good big sister. Well, then maybe we should all, you know, try being more considerate with each other. We're a family. We should start acting like one, right? Good. Thanks, dad. Thank you. Now listen, okay? You stop worrying, all right? Everything's gonna be fine, you know. What do you bet that Toby's is on some ride somewhere right now having the time of his life, huh? Well, you gave us all quite a scare running away like that. Yeah. I know. I'm sorry. Ah, no real harm done. You just needed some time to yourself, didn't you? To think about things. Yeah, I have been thinking. Santa, when you get your memory back and stuff, I was wondering if maybe I could come back to the North Pole with you and Nigel. Now why would you want to do that? Well... So I could have a real Christmas again. Ah... I see. Well, I don't know, Toby- I wouldn't be any trouble. Really! I could help Nigel around the workshop. We're about the same size. I could pretend I was an elf! You wouldn't even know I was there. Well, I suppose so. But... What about your parents? What about Hannah? Oh. I didn't think about that. Well, Hannah could come if she wanted to, I guess, but my mom and dad probably wouldn't want to, 'cause they're always so busy with their jobs. They probably wouldn't even notice I was gone. Toby? Aren't you gonna talk to me, honey? Aren't you gonna even look at me? Do you really think I wouldn't notice if you were gone? I'm sorry, mom. I didn't mean that. I know you'd notice if I was gone. Of course I would, sweetheart. It's just that you and daddy are always putting your work ahead of everything. Including me. So I guess I felt like I wasn't that important. Toby. I am so sorry. I just want us to be a family again, like we used to be. So do I, sweetheart. You know what? I'm gonna prove it to you right now. Hello, Rick? It's Angela. Listen, you're not gonna get those proofs tonight. There are some things in the world that are a lot more important than work. Like spending Christmas Eve with my family. We'll take care of it next week. Oh, and Rick? Have a Merry Christmas, because I'm definitely going to. I love you, mom. And I love you too, baby. Ohhh! - You okay? - I'm fine, dad. Good. - Is everything okay? - Yeah. I called Rick and told him I was gonna be spending the holidays with my family. He'll just have to wait. I thought he would be upset, but he wasn't. I just did the same thing with Tuck, like five minutes ago. I told him that he should even go home and spend Christmas with his family. What did he say? Said it was a great idea, wish he'd thought of it himself. Wayne! Angela! Okay, okay... Tell them what you told me. Well, like I told Nigel, feller who got your bag? Ran into him at the gate. Said his kids got sick eatin' a couple dozen corn dogs, so he couldn't do the contest. I asked him about your bag, rememberin' how you all were lookin' for it, but he said he handed it over to a guy picking up donations for December House. Homeless shelter. End of story. See? While you lot were running around enjoying the amusement park, I was busy finding the bag. I thank you very much. Well... Don't you think we better go get it? Absolutely, what are we waiting for? We've got Christmas to save! Let's go! Come on! Hank, I thank you. Thank you very much. Glad to be a help, oldtimer. Welcome to December House, folks. I'm Wes. We're gonna be serving dinner in about 15 or 20 minutes. Oh, um, no, thank you. We're here to find something. Uh, yes, we've lost a... Santa bag. Red velvet? Gold trim? About this big. We were at the Fantasy Fair and apparently, one of your driver's picked it up. That'd be Karl. Karl Coker. He should be back soon. Probably in an hour. Maybe two. An hour? Mister, you know what? You could do me a really big favor. Whatever you need, sir! Do you think you could play Santa for the kiddies? I was gonna do it myself, but you clearly have me beat. It would be my pleasure. That's awfully nice of you. I've got a chair set up right here. Hello, my dears! Come on up! You know, as I recall, Santa always had a pair of helpers. Go. One hour? Maybe two?! This is an absolute disaster! Oh, this young fella. Come on. Ooh, what a weight! You realize we spent most of the day searching for a "magic bag" for "Santa Claus" and his "head elf"? We don't even really know who these guys are. You're right, we don't. But I do know, that yesterday we were like four people who just happened to live in the same house. But today? We're a family again. So if Santa Claus is a guy who brings you gifts, then as far as I'm concerned, this guy is definitely Santa Claus. Oh! I'd like that for Christmas! That's pretty good. You know what? I love you so much... I can't help myself. It's almost departure time, we have less than an hour. We still don't have the bag. Santa still has no memory. It's all over. There's no hope. * O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree, * * Thy leaves are green forever * * O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree... * So sorry, Santa. I failed you. I'm the worst head elf in history! I'm just pathetic. * Thy leaves are green at Christmas time * Go ahead and fire me, get it over with. * Thy leaves are green forever * Fire you? Nonsense! In fact, I've decided I'm gonna promote you. * For every year the Christmas tree * Promote me? After what I've done?! Because of what you've been doing, Nigel, For me, for the world. You've been working your heart out, in order to save Christmas. A lot of good it's done. Christmas wouldn't be in trouble in the first place if it wasn't for me! I sent you out a night early! And now... Christmas Magic is finished! Well, now, that's not entirely accurate. What do you mean? Remember how we found them this morning? Yes. Dysfunctional to say the least. Couldn't even get them to sing together. Now look at them. They're a family again. * That makes each toy to sparkle bright * * O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree... * If that's not Christmas Magic, Nigel, then I don't know what is. * ...brightly! * Well done! Merry Christmas! I got presents for everyone! Santa! It's the bag! All right, here you go! And for you! Oh, what a lovely smile. There you go! You don't mind, do you? I've been looking all over for this! I'll bet you have. Go ahead. Merry Christmas! Thank you, kind sir! Kids. There you go and one for-- Oh, don't bother tryin' to empty it! Drive you crazy! Oh, there you go! I think Nigel has the bag. Hey! You did it! You found the bag! Here it is. Do you remember it? I have- I have seen this bag before. It looks exactly like... It looks exactly like one of the bags we saw at Fantasy Fair! Wrong answer? Well, at least you found the bag. That's something. I suppose. But we still need the altimeter. Wayne, can you call and see if it's arrived? Uh... Well... Uh... Actually, the... the thing is about the altimeter, I never actually ordered it. You didn't?! But why? I'm still not 100 percent sure that you guys are, you know, Santa Claus and his head elf. I mean, it's pretty far-fetched. I see. You don't believe us. I'm so sorry, Nigel. You guys seem great, but, you know, you have to understand that-- Take out a present, Wayne. Take a present. You want me to take a present? All right, which one? It doesn't matter. The bag only gives what the recipient of the gift needs. "To Wayne Fox." It... It's an altimeter. But that's- that's not possible. How did this get... That means that... They're real! They're really real! Well, it took you long enough to figure it out. I know, I know. I... Oh no! That means Christmas really is in jeopardy! Big time! Santa's lost his memory, and we only have 35 minutes before it's all too late. 22 minutes, dad. Is that enough time? Uh, not really, but... I'll do my best. Santa, let's you and I harness the reindeer! Good idea! I thought, if anything could jog Santa's memory, It would be that bag! So what are you gonna do? How's Santa gonna make his rounds tonight? I haven't a clue! Come on, Nigel, think, think! - Well, you must know the route. - The route? Santa's route around the world. You must know it. Intimately! I spent an entire year planning it! Well, now, you've got the bag back, you'll have the Christmas Magic working for you. That's true. Well, then... Mom's right, Nigel! If you know the route and you have the bag you can be Santa's memory! That's it! I've got it! I can be Santa's memory! I knew I'd think of something. Santa! I've figured it out! I know the route. I can be your memory! You just have to do the driving, I'll take care of the rest! Ingenious! Nigel, you are such an amazing individual! Well done! Well done! Now fix that buckle! Oh! You know, I was kind of upset when you ran away today. Yeah, right. No, I'm serious. I was actually more than kind of upset. No way! Would you like me to tell Toby what you wanted for Christmas when you were seven years old? Absolutely not. Too late now. When, uh, Hannah was seven, she didn't ask for dolls or clothes, or anything like that. What she asked for... was a baby brother. You really asked for that?! I mean, I had to. Being an only child it was so boring. You wanted me! Okay, okay, I wanted you, but I want right now you, is for you to let me go, okay? Did you manage to do it? Yeah! We're good to go here! Excellent! You truly are a miracle worker, Wayne Fox! And with ten minutes to spare! We're gonna make it. Santa, we're ready! Let's go! Magnetic compass, on. Airspeed indicator, on. Altimeter... On. Yay! Now all we need is the magic word! The what? The magic word. You say the magic word and the reindeer go... up, up and away! Oh my stars! You don't remember it, do you? Uh... no. So close! We were so close! Magic word! Magic wor-- I mean, how many magic words could there possibly be?! Shazam! Asta la vista! - I've got an idea! - What? What if you just ask the reindeer nicely? Oh, you mean, just... Sort of amble up to them and talk to them politely? Yeah. Worth a shot. Okay, uh... Um... Names? Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen. Cupid, Comet... - What's the-? - Donner! - Uh, yeah. - Uh, Blitzen! Yeah, yes. Okay, uh, fellas, ladies... Off we go, huh? Ha ha! Heh! Ha! Heh. Up, up and away! Ha! Oh, come on! Flying away now! Ha ha ha! This'll do it! Ooh, look, Granola! Now, now, now, fetch! One more time. Do it again! Now fetch! Good try, Toby, but it's clear they won't move without the magic word. It didn't work, Nigel. I'm sorry. This is a disaster. We only have four and a half minutes left. We'll never make it. I know, I'm sorry. I tried as hard as I could. You know, I just think now, that I'll never be Santa Claus ever again. Hey. Now you stop that nonsense right now, Mister. You will always be Santa Claus. Okay? You just need to take a deep breath... And relax. And it'll come to you. Now you keep this closed up tight so you don't catch a chill. Did you remember your hat and your gloves? Oh, yes, yes, uh... I have them right here. Good. Oh, I made you a thermos of hot cocoa to take with you. Oh, I like hot cocoa. Well, it's the first rule of winter: you put something warm on the inside... So you don't get cold on the outside. So you won't feel cold on the outside. What? What is it? What you just said, that sounded very familiar. Someone else said that to me and... It wasn't that long ago. I... Nigel, let me have that bag. It gives what the recipient of the gift needs, right? Yes. Oh, I hope this works! This is for you. Oh, thank you. Mrs. Claus! Whoa Prancer, Vixen! It worked! That's the magic word! "Mrs. Claus"! I remember now! Nigel, my boy. I remember who I am! I am Santa Claus! Angela! My darling girl! You did it. You did it! I thank you. Thank you. You're welcome. Santa! We have to leave. - We only have two minutes. - Yes, you're right, Nigel. I'm just saving us a stop later on. This is for my dear friend, Hannah! Merry Christmas, my dear! Mom, look! Now we can take photos together! And now... Something for a very special young man. Reach inside! Be very, very careful. It's Max! Max! He's so cute! Oh, you remembered! I told you I would! Can I keep him? Of course you can, sweetheart! Wayne! Angela! I do believe you two already have everything you need. We certainly do. Thank you. Thank you so much. Good? Great? Everybody happy? Can, uh, we go now? Please! All: (laughing) As you say, Nigel, as you say. Oh! Toby! I just thought of something else! - Your last wish! - My last wish? Wouldn't be much of a Christmas now, would it? Without snow? The shooting star! That was you! Goodbye, my dear, and thank you all. Till the next time. To the sky and goodbye! Mrs. Claus! On my beauties! On we go! Oh ho ho ho ho ho! Ho ho ho ho ho ho! Bye, Santa! Bye, Nigel! Ho ho ho ho ho ho! Merry Christmas! Hang on, Nigel! It was the night before Christmas... Oh, but not quite. Because some creatures were stirring and that wasn't right. You see, Santa's schedule was wrong. A mistake had been made. And this was the story of how Christmas was saved.
