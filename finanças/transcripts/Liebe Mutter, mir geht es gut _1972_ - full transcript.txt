Dear Mother, I'm All Right Dear friends from West Germany! In this booklet you have here... you'll have found information... on life in West Berlin. As mayor of this city... I can assure you that we are happy... to welcome any friend form the West... who comes here to share... our life and work in Berlin. We will do everything to help those who come here... to love our city and become Berliners. So allow me to assure you: Your future is West Berlin. A worker who doesn't do his work... who fights, swears at his comrades... agitates against superiors gets what's coming to him The film shows how this works... and why we consider this as normal. Workers fighting agains increased rents... learning from their defeats... or fruitlessly fighting lay-offs... and drawing their conclusions. Finally striking and thereby discovering their strength... beginning to change their lot. This film shows us these workers and poses the question why we don't regard them as normal. Gimme something to read too. Take your pick. Lothar has two more. Leave the ashtray for Lothar to clean up. Cheerio Scheff! Alfred Schefczyck lived in Baden- Wiirtemberg till 1966. He was an assistant fitter... in a machine factory. He was fired during the economic crisis of 1966. He came to live in West Berlin and has had a job... in the metal industry for six months. He lives in a hostel for West German and foreign workers. Alfred works from 6 AM to 2.15 PM. Look at all them fancies you're bringing! Is all that for us? - OK, drop it there What the hell's that? Let's weigh this one for the hell of it Are you trying to be funny? This load's over 60 pounds, I told you before The women can't handle this. So take it back like a good boy and divide it between two crates. The galvanizers have no more crates. That's your problem. Clear off. Can't I leave this stuff here... and get another crate? Be sure to get it right. It's too heavy again. You can manage it like me I still got hell from the checkers. I need another crate. Go some other place, I haven't got time to find crates You piece workers, earning a fat pay and still moaning! And I'm just your sciffy. You gotta understand, we're on piece work I'll only take crates with the exact weight. You see we're slaving away We're not paid to find you crates. Don't make me cry. Always moaning Here's your crate but it's the last time I'll buy you a beer. Haven't you got an old crate for me? If I gave them away to you lot, what would we do? Are your selling them or what? Where's all them new ones? Bad times - more work for us there is always something. Hands off, scrounger! You've got plenty You'd like to have a go, huh? You gone blind, or what? They haven't been nickled yet. Even experts can make mistakes. Go on, you tranport expert! Crickey, you're on high grade fuel today! In great form! Me sense of duty, mate Your sense of duty? Don't know the word, do you? I'll explain it. If ever this dump goes broke... there'll be two men left here, me and the foreman. I'll be working and he'll supervise. And the bosses will still get paid. That's sense of duty And what's your wife say to that? She counts the dough and keeps her mouth shut. You must be having quiet nights at home. You said it. Can you lend me your welder over the weekend? A big safe, is it? I want to make a gate for my garden. Do you know how to handle it? Yes, I've seen it done... What about the materials? I can get some steel bars cheaply. Go to the locksmith, he'll fix it. My welding kit isn't very good. How big should the gate be? Large enough to get the car through. Too heavy to do it with steel bars. The mass is too great. It'll break the hinges. You'd better use profiles. Can you draw it for me? Well... I haven't got that far yet. Better move on, Werner is watching He can get lost. Can you cut me some sheet-iron for a friend? Tomorrow, I'm busy now. Can't I even use your cutter? Want to clip your nails? OK but don't get caught. I'll take some of those scraps. But make sure that's all you take! Alfred Schefczyck had been a fitter. But when he came to Berlin in 1966... he couldn't find a suitable job. Finally he took on the job carrying crates... in this factory where he thought fitters might be needed. He thought he wouldn't do unskilled work for long... Also, the foreman had given him to understand... he would get piece work at the first opportunity. Hey Kurt, you're blocking up the way! I've had my fill waiting for you. Got to leave it somewhere. Your foreman was here and pulled a face. Hang on, you're giving me double work. How can you go walking around, with this pressure on here. You stubborn bastard! Your bloody business! Stop it! You're messing up everything. I need the bolts for the compressors, this minute! OK, I'll get you some. If my foreman saw me doing your work... he'd think I've nothing to do... and without materials the turners can't get on either. Stop making more work! Stupid bastard! Nice language around here! Do you have to yell? What's wrong, Mr. Ulrich? You have to wait for hours here. Where've you been, Mr. Schefczyck? I had my cart repaired. You should have taken another one. Leaving your place without permission.. I thought I better get it fixed quickly. Repairs are not your concern. Just dropping everything and strolling about! And stopping Mr. Ulrich getting on with his work. I have to deliver my parts in time, too. And fighting with colleages. Where do you think you are? You're making the whole shop rebellious. Try cooperating to speed things up. What are you waiting for? Give me a hand. Here are your bolts. In this confrontation with his foreman... Alfred saw his piece work go down the drain. He had broken the rules. He was furious. But could this help him... and against whom should he direct his anger? You see, if you really try... nobody has to wait... and you're worth your pay. You know the economic situation is strained. Don't be oversensitive. THE WORKS MANAGER Our less zealous colleagues will have to earn their pay. We've got orders to fill and goals to achieve. That's no point of debate. Our competitors aren't sleeping. THE COMPANY DIRECTOR We should integrate our units even more... aiming for maximum effi ciency. Only he who concentrates... fully on growth will be able to survive. Yes, I agree with you. THE MAJORITY STOCKHOLDER Reduce special benefits and increase productivity. In times of recession we must get rid of that social crap. We no longer need to make consession. I certainly agree. THE MINORITY STOCKHOLDER We are against unnecessary expenditure. THE SMALL STOCKHOLDER I do agree. I thank you for your comments. Next item: the distribution of profits. RENT INCREASE AT THE HOSTEL What are you reading, Scheff? "The Deadly Wait" That's crap. Lot of old rope. Got an egg to spare? Thanks. Any amount of hard work won't stop them fucking. Why do workers always have more kids... than other people? They need some sort of compensation. Polenz from 142 is moving. His single room will be free. Come to my office. You can have it as promised. I hope you're comfortable, Mr. Schefczyck? Only, we can't afford new furniture every month. See you later, then. Goodnight, gentlemen. Took long enough. You don't deserve it. I'll treat you for a drink. Come on. In July 1967 the Government of West Berlin... raised the rent in the hostel... by 10 marks for each bed. We decided to send a delegation... of which I was a member. We went to see the manager... and asked for a room to hold a meeting. I refuse to enter into a discussion. You have your arguments, I have mine. Besides, I'm not the right person... the increases come from above... and they'll have their reasons. We'd like to know about those reasons. If you don't like it you can leave. I won't give you a room for your meeting, I want quiet. We must all stick together on this. This time it's 10 marks... If we don't react, it will be 20 the next time. What can we do, just 7 or 8 of us? You saw Kriiger's face. Tell him we're all leaving... he'll just laugh. But I listened around today. Nobody will fight for 10 marks. Because everybody's afraid, Kriiger can do as he likes. Because you're all scared shitless. You have to be secure to speak up. You're right. Cheers! We need a strong base to start something. And what could that be? We're here from West Germany because they need us. That's where we should put in the wedge. OK, then we'll leave again. So if we let the pulic know... if we let them know what's happening... some of those gentlemen might not like it. Having to smuggle women through windows... Stop yelling. Want everyone to hear? That'll interest some people: 240 marks for a room.. with four beds, or even more... and that Kriiger can throw someone out for speaking up... - A communist. - He wasn't! Of course he was" Who else talks about "expropriations™? All this talking won't help because no one will follow us. I think they'll come along... and I tell you it won't work. Let's find out who'll go on a rents strike. Blimey, what the hell's that If enough people don't pay the rent, they'll have to listen. Yes, if... That's why I propose... to collect a list of signatures first. Signatures! I thought you wanted to fight. Got a better idea? And where will that get us? We must know who's prepared to act. We'll make a list, and I'll explain it to them. And then they'll sign. Doesn't sound bad. But what if that list gets into the wrong hands? They'll all be kicked out. They're all glad to have this place. No reason to say thanks when they kick us. Besides, if you go into lodgings... that'll cost you 130 marks or more. It won't go that far. That's 50 marks more than here. We won't rush into this without thinking. We only move if we've collected enough signatures. Our mates can add up. If everybody joins in nothing will happen. If, if, always if... Well - will you sign? Yes you! I'm not important. Ask the others. So you're backing down now? Do you mean to say I'm scared? Then leave me out of it. I won't take your insults. Forget it. Show us your new slides. Leave them alone! We aren't finished yet. Let's sleep first... Someone might have an idea tomorrow. You gone crazy? Want me to be kicked out? That's enough! You're all nuts. You don't understand what's happening. This has nothing to do with politics. The toilets are always clogged... 3 or 4 blokes a room for 200 mars... and now 10 marks more. And you close your eyes to it all. We've a right to hold a meeting anytime. But what Kriiger doesn't like... ...doesn't go So we just shut up and forget it. And sure the rent isn't too high. And the rooms are even nicer for the extra 10 marks. And what do you lot do? You say Amen. You'll get used to the rents. Alfred felt the anger rising in him: Against the rent, and the hostel manager. And even more about dirty walls, curtainless windows... Anger against that way of life... and the apathy of his comrades. But then the thought his anger would have no effect... for he too was convinced there were powerless. Cheer up, times will change. Not until they're shaken up properly. So I go all that way for 20 kilos of coal... But I couldn't let the old lady lug the bucket. You'll like some help too when you're that age. Then I'll down my pint and watch the others go of to work. Two more pints and a meatball! A meatball... Where are you from? Not from Berlin, are you? Kempten. You wouldn't know it. And now I'm here, whether you like it or not. Cool down. Suppose they've given you a nice flat... Money and loans to tide you over. Main thing you like it here. Stick to your beer and don't fight with the West Germans. 1 do as I like. Then tell me the difference between... a berlin worker and one from the West. I can tell you. We built Berlin up again... resisted the Russians, and starved... whilst you were stuffing yourselves. - Don't shout! - Leave him, he's OK. Then the comrades came over from the East... and made the wages go down. Made us cry for them, but their rate of exchange... made them rich over there. That's the difference. I caught one of you buggers at my work... I made him see what we are made of. Watch it, or else! Come and get it. Leave the guests alone, Walter. Let him talk. We'll see who's made of what. Tell me: Is a Berliner the same as a Berliner? What are you getting at? Look here: This is a Berliner. He just wants to do his job, quietly. And what does he need to do his job? He needs a machine. And here's another Berliner with this machine. You want to pinch it from him, huh? Why don't you go over the Wall? Walter, be nice to our guests from the West. Now listen: scram, will you? I tell you I won't be had by anyone. Not by any boss, and no West German bastard either! That'll teach him! I'll show this basard... He hasn't had enough yet. That's no way of showing him. Think your yapping will help? Think who'll benefit if you bash each other. Pay up now, gentlemen, and get out! You and your stupid preaching! SHUT DOWN OF WORKSHOP W 14 Your share from the pools: 3 marks 75 What about the rest? It's alright for a start, isn't it? You can talk: you ain't got a family. Think my women cost me nothing? W 14 made 360 marks last week. Then it's worth it. Trying to earn a gold medal? Working like a madman. So I sleep better at night. Did the foreman slip you a cigar? - Quiet! - Shut up! Did you hear they're closing W 14? Who told you? You turners are behind the times. 150 men on the list. That's only rumours. The shop committee is already negotiating. Tall stories. But you hear them a lot these days. They'll give us some of their work. I could use some overtime money. The taxman will get most of it. Got a light? If you give me a fag. 150 men? Is it official? I don't know. All from W 14 or also others? It won't be that bad. The committee will think of something... Today it's overtime, tomorrow short- time... then they fire you, then they take on new ones... they really deserve a kick in the ass. We in West Berlin can't allow ourselves the luxury... of keeping up units that lose money... while we can't man the profitable ones. The company must not be hindered... from adapting itself to the demands of the market... in its investments and sales policy. The board of directors has taken note of the facts. We hope that you, who represent the workers... are now convinced of the urgency... to transfer W 14 to the federal republic. Of course for you shop stewards... this is a hard decision to accept. But be assured that we too... don't act without reason. The good of our company... and the workers is our only concern. Gentlemen... I may have said this before... but I'd like the restate our arguments: When the buildings in Hannover were bought... we saw no purpose in it... as there were vacant buildings in Berlin. And we were told: Don't worry.. Hannover will merely be subcontractors for W14 where the qualified work will be done. We asked for guarantees. that employment wouln't be reduced... or even stopped entirely in Berlin. And at that meeting you declared... that on the contrary this would give Berlin more work. That's why we finally agreed to it. And what happened? First: It went like we prophesied. The splitting-up of W 14 production... only made for increased costs. Second: For a whole year, at our expense... you employed unqualified labour... because their was no skilled labour... the market being dried up. Third, you transfered the drilling machine... our only modern equipment to West Germany. Now that labour is available in Hannover... you start laying off skilled workers in Berlin. So you want us to agree to the closing of W 14. What I think is: You're using the recession... to increase efficiency at our expense. Here are the facts. You're trying to hoodwink us with your calculations. You have the right to check everything. Gentlemen, let's be honest: You bought those buildings with this shut-down in mind. You want our agreement to record: "decision unanimous". That's what we get for agreeing to you before when... Let's not get distracted from our subject. When times were good you invested without thinking... and now you want us to pay. It was also profitable for the workers. Spare us your cynicism. You know very well the wage raises... in the past were merely a fraction... of what the shareholders got. And what we're discussing today isn't investment policy... but reduce production. Everything on the worker's back... going ahead, stopping again... The measures we are discussing now... are due to hard economic necessities. Two months ago it was very different. You then told the committee... workers would be taken on for W 14. When did I say that? July 18th 1967... during a meeting. I don't remember, do you? No, neither do I... Do you think we're idiots? It's not the first time promises are broken. And we're the victims, as always. Please gentlemen... try to see it objectively Obijectively? It's quite clear: For the reasons we just stated... we refuse to accept the closing of W 14. The directors drew attention to the benefits scheme... which they would draw up with the committee... to alleviate social hardships. with the vote came the final decision. Those in favour raise a hand please... Those against?... A week later 138 people were laid off. Come on, Alfred, this one's on me! It's my farewell drink... After all we had gained some kind of respect... even as a worker. Sometimes we could even say: That's no good, it should be like this. Even to the bosses. And there were plenty of them. Any little upstart could think himself boss... if he had a white overall. After 10 years you know how to defend yourself... Of course now the job's gone. There's plenty of jobs But you have to start all over. And me being over 50... I can't start all over again. True, I survived the war. What the Americans left standing the Russians grabbed. Then we were told: Let's get going. So we started to work real hard. We cleared the rubble. We salvaged what we could. Good. And then? The French took everything Plenty of nothing again. Then came the monetary reform... dried potatoes, and the new money... And we were told: Let's try again. After all we're Germans. So we started again. Then came the Economic Miracle. And what did it do for us? See: I'm back on the street. Are you drunk or what? I'm quite sober. I'll get you some coffee. ... final discussion gives us a new starting point. for preparing the next meeting of the committee. To sum it up: A workshop meeting has to be prepared carefully. We must proceed as follows: Report on the committee's activities... discussion of this report... and answering the worker's questions. I'm going back home. I've had enough. Just a few hours overtime and that's it. I need a change. They closed W 14, the bastards. Why get so worked up? They're doing as they always did. Tell that to those who got kicked out. They worked their asses off for years... they thought that workers and management... were together in this. Machines were baught, the factory expanded... by their work. And now it is: "No more orders... here are your papers, we're sorry." Just kicked out, like 10 years ago. Some have a car, or a small bank account. But nothing of the millions they earned for the factory... And they just shut up, like they've learned. Yap, yap, yap... Does that get us anywhere? People are sacked. They can't eat your speeches. You have to see the whole picture. Better tell us what to do. Your speeches won't change anything. Life stays like it always was. A MANAGER'S VIEW Some diehards are still obsessed... by foggy ideas from the previous century. A small minority in a rather malevolent way.. throw the old clichés at us... which are as close to reality... as a computer to a steam engine. But we industrialists don't stand alone any more. Since the last war pleasing things... have changed the image of the exploiting bosses. Let me quote Professor Erhard... who says literally: I would never have introduced... the politics of a social economy... without complete faith in industrial management. Why shouldn't I have good relations... with my subordinates? I do everything to create a team-spirit. The industrial bill helps us in this. A COUNCIL MEMBER'S VIEWS They say we are in the same boat as the bosses. But the question is: Who has to row, and who does the steering? Our electors say: "You sit in the supervisory board... smile at the bosses and get your pay.” And even when they see us fighting for their rights... We haven't the power to asert these rights. The papers say there is plenty of work. Maybe, but not for unskilled workers. They've cut my pay, blow the committee. I'm kicked out. What were you elected for? You always thought nothing could happen. You said: "We are doing better then ever.” You only show up when it's too late. Who's investing or closing down shops? Whose word is law here? You are our representative. Where's our jobs! There are laws for everything. Here they are, your laws! Just stick them up yours! Then you'll know who's the boss here. A WORKER'S VIEW They say prosperity has made us soft. But as a worker I know very well... the only security is in the graveyard. For instance: The stockholders of A.E.G. - Telefunken... got 74 millions divided despite the crisis. And preferential shares... giving them another 125 million. At the same time 50 million were saved in wages... through rationalization and lay-offs. If there's profit for the company our jobs are safe. But that shouldn't blind the workers. They know they're in the corner And the boss sees to it they stay there. The workers have their own ideas... but they should be coordinated. PIECEWORKERS' STRIKE In September 1967 production was changed... at the factory where Schefczyck worked. New timing charts were calculated... around the conference table. As a result wages went down. This can't go on. They'll end up doing anything they like. Try and see it our way... We won't raise another finger... unless we go back to the old timing. Why make such an issue of it. You've been promised a new timing... Why not wait for that. If they say we are going to get a new timing... it won't be ready before Christmas. Or even later... And work with that new timing till then? That means a loss of 20 marks a week. The management knows this means... a certain rearrangement for all of you. You can say that again. So they'll try to get it through quickly. You can't tell beforehand... that you'll lose by it. The opposite! If they introduce new rates... then not to give us more money. Now please, go back to work. Don't do anything rash! We've shown that we can pull our weight... if necessary. - That's right... The company can't complain. It paid off for you, didn't it? Even more for the company... But we can't agree to these rates. The other shops don't complain. We don't give a damn. A big mouth for an unskilled worker. What's that got to do with it. Tell the management we don't accept their rates... and want the proper timing rates, right now. As soon as they promise this... we go back to work. Tell ‘em that. Just watch him rush out. Today he's earning his money. Better save some energy for his wife. The galvanizers are on strike against the new rates. They really raising hell? Erwin, come here! Stop working, and watch them come to time us. I like your optimism. You should join in, you have some influence. If you join in, they'll follow you. They've never yet taken a new timing. We've been had again, serves us right. You know what I think. What's happening? You know, I just got three more years... Then I can retire. If I get thrown out now, you understand... Leo, have you heard? The galvanizers are on strike! Fritz, come here. Something's happening. Do you mean they're striking? Looks like it. Is that true? Go and have a look, Leo. The galvanizers, you said? The charge hands can come to state their claims. Why not send the foreman? - What do you mean? You know... Now things are moving. Come, don't be shy. Just the charge hands? Nothing doing. The management agrees to chosen delegates. That's something. They're getting the message. They're afraid to come here... We chose our delegates, the foreman can show the way. If I may give you some advice: Don't say anything rash about the new rates. You haven't put them to the test yet. One man from each section. Go on, Leo! Back to the old rates! But watch what you're saying. Who's going for the drillers? Kutte, you go for us. Gerhard, you're our man anyway. He knows when to speak up. Go now, the work must go on. You tell the other charge hands. Colleagues, I hope you all agree... that we can't give in. Yes, like before... It's a provocation, the way they treat us. Off with you, Werner. The charge hands should be in on this. I think you're going a bit far. There's the committee. Lowka's coming! We'll tell him a thing or two. Why, look at who's coming! We need you, you know them. - Beat it. - Why, let him talk. You nearly missed the bus again. What do you want? Haven't you noticed anything yet? We want the new rates withdrawn. Our representatives are going to see the management. Kutte, Leo and I are just going. Do you think that'll help? Our committee has been negotiating for 3 weeks. That's news. We never see you. I can't be everywhere all the time. The thing is to keep negotiating. You'll still be negotiating in 50 years! If we don't do anything we'll be done in again. Listen, Lowka: You go and bring your committee here... and we'll all decide what we'll say. That the worst thing we can do. Lowka's backing out! If the committee gets involved in this rash action... we give them a stick to beat us with. We try to prevent new lay-offs... and you do your best to get kicked out. Watch it, or we'll plate your ass! We want action, right now! Don't you see things are boiling up? Be objective. Try to see the other side. You weaken your position, and mine as well. The management will see we don't cooperate. Cooperate in keeping quiet? If you push yourselves into the negotiations... you'll just stiffen the fronts... and we won't be able to get any concessions. You're bargaining for concessions? We never noticed till now! We all want the same thing. But yours is the wrong way of going about it. Are you paid for handling out that crap? - How much are you paid - Out, Lowka! But don't you see, the shop committee... cannot support your strike. ‘Cause you don't want to! We're not allowed to! There you see, you're no use to us. Get back to your cushy office. You'll be safe there. Just think who is the stronger. Today we are! You're a traitor to the workers! You'll do yourselves in. Stupid bastard... Well, it's true, isn't it? Lowka, stay here. We won't negotiate, we'll just demand! Yes, let them feel our strength. Careful! They'll skin you alive. We must get this under control quickly... before some of them exploit the situation... How on earth could this happen? Didn't you notice the sighs? How! Their meeting passed off quietly... and the foreman reported no talk about the shut-down... It's simply a matter of the new rates. Surely it must have been brewing! You never reported unrest. Otherwise we would have been more careful... and introduced the rates gradually. And now we've got this mess! It couldn't be foreseen... The shock of the lay-offs and the close- down... showed in the restraint of their shop- committee... And still we had no idea of their mood! Do you think there is a certain group behind this? No, I think it's spontaneous. Nothing was done to make other sections join. Maybe it's being done now. And what is Lowka's position? He is a reasonable man. The committee itself is in the line of fire. The delegates are with Mr. Bieler, sir. Let them wait! We must be aware of the seriousness of the situation. This is the end of the recession. After the end of our reorganisation... our manpower is up to optimal numbers. When the new orders start coming in... we can't afford breaks in production. We can't afford lon-lasting conflicts. That means three things: Their spontanious action must have no success. If we give in to such tactics... we expose ourselves to anything. So we must only let them deal with us... through their legal channels. Mr. Bieler, tell them we'll only talk... to their legal representatives... meaning to the committee. Second point: The strike must not be allowed to spread. Find out what the other workers think... especially the skilled ones. Keep it limited to the rates. We'll talk on that, and nothing else. Third point: We must confine our reactions to threats. So long as we cannot calculate... precisely what their reaction will be. Don't pour oil on the fire. Better keep on a loudmouth than stop production. Let the foremen spot the militants... but do nothing before I've been informed. And one more thing: If the situation gets worse... we'll have to reconsider the rates. But otherwise... our motto will be: We'll negotiate after everything's back to normal. Where've you been all this time? Some things to do. The checking section is waiting for parts. There's nothing to check, we're striking. And how long is that going to last? Go see for yourself. You must know what you're doing. Of course, Mr. Bieler. First the galvanizers' delegates. OK, let's go. Only the galanizers' delegates. The others please wait. I think we should stick together How we say it is not that important. We all have the same to say, so... One moment, please. These gentlemen want to see you all together. Wait... Good day, gentlemen. Let's not complicate matters. Let the two delegates from each workshop... explain their colleages' problems. We are here together... and want to talk to you collectively. I am certain that you want this... settled as quickly as possible. As this concerns new dispositions... and new rates for the different groups... I think it would be better to talk... to each group separately. These changes affect us all together And none of us can accept these rates. But our work's different. Certainly. That's why.. each shop should state its problem. That's the quickest way to find a solution for all. You go ahead, you know the problem. Having heard the statement of Gerhard Brahm... on the new rates... the manager started to explain the reorganisation measures. He mentioned economic problems... losses and profit, technical matters... and said that a revision of wages was needed... if they were to stay competitive. The worker Gerhard Brahm lacked information about this. So the manager concluded as instructed: Only an immediate return to work could... prevent strong punitive action. Is that all you've achieved? Negotiate? We wanted their promise. They'll review the timing, that was all. They'll kick us in the balls. You backed down. We asked for a review, didn't we. But when? I bet not for ages. We're the losers again. Yes, always us... We did our best. You did nothing at all. After all it's the first time... the management talked with workers... And maybe the committee can get them... to keep paying our average monthly pay... Yes, on the day that never comes. The management knows what they're doing. They first want us to go back to work. Or they'll set an example. - We'll see - You'll see... You call that concessions? We talked with them, didn't we? They just gave us a lecture, that's what. I must say their reasons don't sound bad. Their reasons? You didn't listen properly. They'll set an example, unless we resume work. So that's it... Well, they're not charity. And I have nothing to give away either. Can you make sense of this talk, Scheff? You've been had, and the charge hands just yap. But he makes sense, too. Wait and see what's in this for us. The foremen alwas get something. Don't kid yourself. We got to keep cool. They threatened us, that's clear. You may understand their reasons or not. Werner said something true for a charge... they're not charity. No guts, but a lot of wind. Shut up, Werner's right. As they're no charity, they'll fight to keep these rates. And to skin us. Only if we go back to work again. We must all stay here... And the management must come to us... to negotiate in front of everybody. No one gets back to work. Don't be too sure. This is completely stupid. Well, we agreed with them on the next steps... Are you mad or what? And they don't mind kicking a few men out. They promised nothing at all. They talked about a review, nothing else. Isn't that enough? Try to agree just for once. One talks of action, the other of reason...and the third about charity first try to agree about something... and then talk. I've had enough of this. What fuss he's making! I never seen Harry like that. Don't forget why we're here. We know what their promises are worth. I'm sick of all this shit. Why don't some of us think something out first. You always find something to nag. Shut up, or I'll make you. Steady, you nitwit... You said? Take it easy, Pagels. Don't get excited. We must have this timing done as soon as possible. Let's wait till then. Hasn't Gerhard made the point clear enough? They promise you that timing... to make you go back to work... But you don't seriously think the result... will be a return to the old rates. They'll find a way to keep you down. We just won't let them. I think Gerhard is right. We must have the management here. Then they'll have to take a clear stand. You have a fine imagination. Don't you fool yourself. You're 50 or 70, they can't ignore that. Can't they - with 50 out of 2000! But you can stop the whole works. What are the other workshops doing? I saw the toolmakers and the fitters... You're right on the ball, Scheff! But they won't go along with us yet. They say it doesn't concern them. So you needn't wait for them. Can't see beyond the ends of their noses. They haven't been informed properly. They'll say: Tomorrow, not today. We've been here for two hours now... they haven't shown up yet. But you didn't go to see them. They won't take a stand. All well and good what you're saying... but it's utopian. You'll learn, Scheff. And what next? Wait for the results of the negotiations. We aren't through yet. What more is there to say.. They've agreed to negotiate. Keule, come back... And negotiations are for the committee. Come, Kutte... We have nothing but words, no definite promise. How do you expect ro get any results... if you put your head in the noose. We all took a risk by striking. But that's all we can do, in these times. Right. Stop it, Gerhard. Who'll pay for lost time? Not the unions, I'm sure. Stop the fuss, Gerhard... Let's wait a bit. You have to be in the shit up to your mouth... What was that? Come here if you want trouble. Only an increase of profits and bigger investments... can help us out of this. At this stage we cannot afford social conflicts. Fear of unemployment... makes a man work conscienciously. We must keep cool, or else... we'll lose all we've achieved. Everything's checked, it's all right. So everything is quiet. Now we must bring them back to order. - Did you strike? - Yes... For what reason? To get what's our due. We decide on that. We went back to work. We must enforce the laws which protect the peace. Do these laws protect us, too? That's enough! You're fired! They gave me one hour to clear off the grounds. The personnel manager forbade me to go back to the shop. But as I had been in charge of the timing... I had to hand over the cards in there... so they gave me a watchdog. I went to change, then I went back... to the workshop, with my watchdog. I took the longest possible way... so everybody could see me. When they saw me in ordinary clothes... I told them I was kicked out. Most acted sorry, some got angry. Then I went to the shop steward... and he phoned the union... who'll represent me in my court-case. Nothing much will come of it. Some compensation, maybe. I shouldn't have said I was in the strike... I should have said I was their representative... and that I had given them some advice. But I think the stand I took in the personnel office.. will spurn my colleages on. Read this an sign. Did you write that? Only three signatures? Now 4, and with yours 5. If this is ever found... There will be trouble. That won't help Gerhard anyway. And now, sign. When we've got enough, they'll understand... and Gerhard will come back. You think they'll be impressed? I'll sign when there are more... You're a real friend. Make your cross here. That's hot stuff... The workers will consider taking action... if this dismissal isn't revoked. Big words... Who'll do the organizing? We'll see to that later. Better know that first. But we don't know how they will react. You talk about action” there... I'll sign when I know what that is. How much rent do you pay? 80 marks I pay 280. - Why? - Nothing... Leo, I need your signature. Just 3 from Gerhard's section? Is that all?! What does the committee say to this? They don't want to upset the negotiations. I think it's useless. We'll see. I only got a few signatures. But I talked to Axel and Leo again. And we think, considering how all those years... the little man always kept quiet... and swallowed everything... this strike was a considerable achievement. Bruno would say: It's still al long way from conscious class struggle... But one has to make a start somewhere. Dear mother, I'm doing well. Stop worrying about me. The machine work isn't hard, I earn more now. I'll be moving out of the hostel soon... 1968 saw the end of the first postwar recession. Investments were on the increase... The papers said: "Recovery goes on in a satisfactory way".
