There was a lot of men's lives wrapped up in this place. You'd walk across this gantry and enter the airlock. At that point you'd entered another world. A world of noise. There was no music, no birds singing. It was completely, entirely, brutally industrial in every single aspect. You'd get your pit gear on, your helmet, your boots and you'd walk across the yard... the bells rang. The steel doors would slam shut and you'd descend and you'd set off slowly then you'd just drop like a bullet, and at that point there was silence. VENTILATION SHAFT It's a real shock to come back and see it all like this. At one point well over 2,000 people worked here. When you think that was over 2,000 breadwinners for families, working in the bowels of the earth producing coal, which apparently at the time was the future, as we thought, but... people higher up the pecking order thought otherwise. THE BRITISH COAL INDUSTRY IS THREATENED 160,000 MINERS GO ON STRIKE VICTORY TO THE MINERS THE LONGEST NATIONAL STRIKE IN BRITISH HISTORY THE MINERS ACTIVE ON THE FRONTLINE NUMBER... JUST 16 000 THE MEDIA DUBS THEM ARTHUR'S ARMY As national president of this union I'll tell you the terms: No pit closures, No pit closures. MARGARET THATCHER CALLS THEM THE ENEMY WITHIN THIS IS THEIR STORY They are the enemies of democracy, they're trying to kill democracy for their own purposes. STILL THE ENEMY WITHIN A hard, dirty, dangerous, tough job. When you're doing a coalface, they have a thing called the hellhole at one end and it's got no support. I used to think, "I bet it collapses when I'm going through it" and I used to scurry through it like a rat. I was sitting there eating my sandwich and drinking my tea and I couldn't see the bloke sitting a foot away because of the dust. I could just see this dull yellow glow of his lamp. He said, "Sunderland were crap on Saturday, weren't they?" I said 'I know.' Anybody watching this scene would think 'God!' They'd run a mile. And we're sitting as if it's the most natural thing in the world. Being a miner in those times was like living politics. It was not talking about politics, it wasn't abstract; it was real. If someone was sent out of the pit for some ridiculous misdemeanour everybody in the pit would down tools and go out the pit. The idea of solidarity, sticking together was something tangible. It really meant something to us, it wasn’t just a slogan. Sticking together just becomes a habit. When I was buying my first house I went to see a mortgage advisor. Mortgage lenders would give you three times your annual salary. They said they'd give us four times. When I asked why he said: Your job, unlike others, is secure. You've got a job for life. If you know what a coal mine looks like, get a job in Britain's modern mining industry and get more out of life. Be a miner. Ask at your local pit or job centre. PEOPLE WILLALWAYS NEED COAL A huge crowd and a huge cheer. 1979 MARGARET THATCHER IS ELECTED BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Her Majesty the Queen has asked me to form a new administration... and I have accepted. Thatcher's intention plainly stated by her. She was going to change industrial relations for good. She was going to change British society... away from dependence on state and all those things. She was going for the throat. MANUFACTURING TRADE BALANCE TIME SPENT FINDING A JOB OFFICIAL STRIKE There has been a sharp rise in the number of people without work. Jobs are vanishing faster. The number of people out of work took a sharp turn for the worst. I have only one thing to say: You turn if you want to. The lady's not for turning. The real problem we face today... is we've lived through a long period of increasing trade union power. It's also been a period when we've had increasing left-wing militancy in control of the unions. Oh yes we have and the country knows it. The people in the rank-and-file of the unions know it too. Unions meant something in Britain and... at the head of that movement was the National Union of Mineworkers. They were the best organised, the most militant. Part of Thatcherism, monetarism, was to undermine organised workers. The miners had beaten the Tories in '72, they'd beaten them again in '74, that rankled in the conservative ranks. There were massive strikes in the '70s. The Tory government was chipping away at our wages. But miners were constantly fighting back. And with strikes causing power cuts, it was obvious that we were winning. Prime Minister Ted Heath had no choice but to put the question... the burning question of the day... POWER CRISIS: EMERGENCY DECLARED Ted Heath called a general election because the lights were going out. HE HAS THE NERVE TO ASK FOR A VOTE OF CONFIDENCE! He said "Who runs the country, us or the miners?" It is time to say to the extremists, the militants and the misguided: We've had enough, there's a lot to be done, let's get on with it." When Ted Heath went to the polls and he said "Who governs?" We told him who governed, and it wasn't him. EXIT HEATH TOTAL VICTORY FOR MINERS To win, it tastes so sweet. What power! Working class people, if they're organised and show solidarity can defeat the government and the state that supports them. Some of the old guys said the Tories will be back for us. We knew from day one we were firmly in Thatcher's sights. What was stopping privatisation and letting rip with profits? Their philosophy of a free market economy, the thing that stood in the way was us. So they started to organise... Sir Nicholas Ridley... Tory MP etcetera, was sent to a right-wing think tank... to dwell on this. They thought long and hard and came up with this plan. It was a beaute, it was a bobby dazzler! RIDLEY PLAN CONFIDENTIAL It outlined how to take on the British trade union movement COUNTERING THE POLITICAL THREAT Thatcher wanted to smash the trade unions. She was going to use every resource at her disposal to do it. The police were bulked up, were trained up in riot gear. Ordinary plods who were mooching round the streets were taken away and trained up how to... in crowd control. LARGE, MOBILE SQUAD OF POLICE It was like setting up a paramilitary force. It was all well planned, well thought out. UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT OFFICE Next they wanted to stop strikers from getting access to benefits, to force them back to work. CUT OFF MONEY TO THE STRIKERS They wanted to attack weaker unions before coming for the stronger ones. This was outlined in the Ridley plan. Whole groups of workers had been attacked. She'd attacked the health workers, the rail workers... the steel workers... and we realised that we were the next in line. To break all the unions, they had to break the strongest union, which was the National Union of Mineworkers. She knew if she smashed our union, the rest of the unions would crumble. We knew what was coming, they'd outlined it for us, in big letters, big shiny lights: "We're coming for you." They started giving us more overtime, wanted us to produce more coal. MAXIMUM QUANTITY OF STOCKS All so that they could outlast us if we ever came out on strike again. There were massive stockpiles, never been seen before. You had climb over it to get in and out of work. Saying digging our graves was never as apt, that's what we were doing. The Tories have never forgotten... the defeat inflicted in 1972 and in 1974. Equally, neither have the miners. In '81, Scargill became president of the National Union of Mineworkers. We knew we were in safe hands for when the Tories came for us. We knew he wasn't going to shirk his responsibility. To the media and the Tories Scargill became a hate figure. He was a representative of a union who wasn't willing to concede, who was prepared to argue his corner and act upon his words. And that frightened them. ARTHUR THE ARROGANT SCARGILL OUTRAGE MOSCOW PLAYS SCARGILL'S TUNE FALL OF KING ARTHUR The Tories wanted the NUM defeated. The best way for them was closing coal mines. They needed an argument for closing coal mines and the argument was they're uneconomic pits. The coal industry was nationalised and for years we had a plan for coal. The policy was about Britain having a long term energy supply, rather than relying on the international market and all the insecurities that come with that. When Thatcher appointed MacGregor head of the Coal Board, that was it. It was as if the agreement had been completely tossed to one side. Can you work with Mr Scargill? I haven't even tried. The question is can he work with me? They brought a hit-man in, he'd done business in Leylands, he'd done business at British Steel, and he was brought into the NCB to do business with miners. It was absolutely nothing about the mining industry. It was nothing about energy, this man was a union buster. And they gave him the top job. Suddenly a pit closure programme was pushed forward. Pits full of coal were marked down for closure 20 PIT CLOSURES 20,000 JOB LOSSES Prior to that, they'd say "We'll close it as it's run out of coal." They'd say to the union "It is running out, it'll have to close, ' but they didn't, MacGregor said "I'm shutting that one and that one, But we're..."', "No arguments, I'm shutting them." He's getting good money, sound, secure position. He's telling lads between 20 and 45 that there's nothing for them. MacGregor's working at 72, I want to be working at 27. Mrs Thatcher said "We want more production in the mines. Produce more of this, produce more coal." We did, and when there was coal on the ground she said: Some of you have to go, there's too much coal in the country." It was the Tory government laying down the gauntlet, telling us that they were coming for us. The Tories and the media had all sorts of figures bandied about how much the coal industry was costing the country and the taxpayer. The board had an accounting system Lehman Brothers would be proud of. They had said they were going to close five collieries, that changed to 20 collieries after a few weeks, but we knew they had plotted to close a lot more than that. This was about communities and people's future and dignity. These people wanted to trash it. There's only pits holding this area together. If this pit goes, it'll be like a plague. They might as well put an gate up and say "That's your pit finished. There's the dole office. That's where you go after school." There'll be nothing left in Blythe. Cardowan and Bedley had been closed, Polmaise was going to close. Kinneil was closed, which was not far from where we worked. With MacGregor announcing even more pit closures, how many pits were going to be left? We could see that 1984, we were going to be forced into strike action, these were provocative actions, couldn't be seen as anything else. DESTROY THE PUBLIC SECTOR MONOPOLIES The challenges started to become more fast and furious. They blockaded the office, trapping Mr MacGregor inside, the miners insisted he should come out to face them all. They came on the attack, the Tories closed Cortonwood Colliery, a productive pit they'd invested in. That was the red line where we had to take action. STOP THE YANKEE HIT MAN The feeling in the Scottish coalfield was electric. There were incredibly bitter scenes at the NUM headquarters in Edinburgh. Everyone was centred on one question, whether to go on strike. Ln some of the delegate conferences, it was nearly coming to violence. It was like we'd backed off and backed off... until our backs are against the wall. We can't go any further back, so we've got to come out fighting. The choice is a simple one. You can allow them to butcher the industry, and do nothing. Or you can join with the rest of us, get off your knees and fight! And if we do it together, we can't lose. Our union meeting was absolutely packed and there was just one thing on the agenda: Are we going to join Cortonwood in strike action to save the pits! And I'll tell you there was no hesitation, every single hand in that hall went bolt upright within a second. There was talk about whether to have a national ballot but the strike moved like wildfire. Tonight all the counties' pits are shut. Pit after pit voted with their feet and they joined the strike. Scotland's out, Kent's out, Wales is coming out, Derbyshire will be out, this strike will be national. The mines will be out in this country. One out, all out. NOW OR NEVER And that was it, we'd started. DAY ONE OF THE STRIKE MARCH, 1984 Apicket line is workers on strike standing in front of the gates trying to persuade the workers to support you in your struggle. Not with violence, with chatter. Support us. This is why we're doing it... Please don't go to work because your support will help us." I was so euphoric that finally we had the chance to fight back, I'd had a few pints of beer. I was... We were picketing Monday at our pit I couldn't wait. With three or four other miners, I went to the gates which wasn't sanctioned by the union because the strike started on Monday. A manager was going in. I remember winding his window down. I said "This is a picket line" He said "It doesn't start until Monday" I said "you're not crossing, I want you to turn round." He started to put his foot down, so I jumped on his bonnet. The car sped off down the pit lane, I'm hanging on to his wipers and he jerked to a stop. I whipped his wiper off, tried to throw it through the side window I felt determined, I thought, we have a good chance of winning. We could change the world with the strike. Me and another lad agreed to meet at 6 a.m. at the stockpile at Bouldon which was huge, and lorries were constantly taking coal away. We'd agreed to meet there to put a picket on, the two of us. I turned up at six o'clock but he didn't. Rain was pouring down. I'm standing in this desolate place, waiting. Suddenly this convoy of lorries pulled up. I stopped the first lorry and I said "I'm an official picket, " he said "You don't look much like a picket, there’s just you." I said "That's all it needs, I am an official NUM picket. I've got authority from my colliery to be here and I'm asking you not to cross this picket line." He said "Urg, " and they all turned their lorries round and went back. I was elated. To turn back six lorries on my own. I thought, "If I can do it on my own, what can we do with loads of us?" COAL NOT DOLE IT COULD BE YOUR PIT TOMORROW We were so optimistic, the last strike took six weeks and brought a government down, so in the first days we thought we could do that in five weeks. NO PIT CLOSURES SCOTTISHAREA MARCH FOR JOBS COAL FOR BRITAIN NOT DOLE FOR MINERS SAVE OUR DADDY'S JOB Good luck! I think Thatcher thought the miners would soon go back to work because the women wouldn't stand for the men not bringing home money, it would be a difficult time for them and we think that she was convinced that the women would resolve the strike very quickly. This iron lady had thousands of iron ladies in the coalfields The women wanted to help. We knew it was going to be a long time. So there was no sitting back and letting things run past you you had to get out... all hands to the pump really. People talk about the feeling of the country at wartime... That's very much what it was like in a microcosm. Here we go, here we go. Here we go, here we go, here we go. The first few weeks we were forever at the NUM headquarters in Sheffield. Special court hearings and lobbies. It was an incredible time... If you see any of the photos, the faces of the people involved It was just... It was awesome. It was absolutely awesome, what a feeling! That general coming together, the fact that we were on the move. We'd moved from a defensive position, being attacked by the Coal Board... to an offensive position, which felt more natural, you're in control of your own lives and your own future. It was such a daunting task that you had to organise, that was the thing, you had to organise. Organisation was the key to it all. Thatcher would not pay money for the miners and the families. Thatcher was thinking, "We'll starve them back to work." But she was pleasantly surprised. We approached it from another angle, we organised soup kitchens, we had one in nearly every little village. It started with breakfast. I was here at five a.m., doing breakfasts. She made the best coffee in Elmsall. They used to send really good things. Really good things. We made use of every single thing, except those snails. They sent some snails once, that's the only thing we never used. - And they didn't like spinach. - They didn't like spinach, no. That's the only two things I think we never used. It was like hunter gatherers, men went out to do the dangerous stuff while the women were doing what women do best, putting a pinny on and working in a kitchen but it didn't stay that way. It didn't stay that way. It was a steep learning curve for a lot of people and what drove people was the moment, the fact that it was important. This was for a lot of people world changing. Their willingness to do things outside normal routines changed. I'll fight tooth and nail with every one of them, with every miner and miner's wife to keep the NUM. It's like being a born again Christian spreading the gospel, you have to speak to people, you have to argue with people, try and convince them what you're saying is right. All those thousands conversations that must have been going off. What was true for me was equally as true for all those people that were involved in the dispute, All those that were prepared to step up, be counted and get on with the job of winning the strike. Miners united will never be defeated! But from the beginning of the strike, there was a problem. On the Nottinghamshire coalfield most miners ignored the instruction to stop work from the national and area NUM leadership. Each area was given a choice to vote, the Notts area voted to come to work so that's why we're here. Nottinghamshire miners produce 25 percent of the country's coal. Without their support, victory for the NUM is uncertain. When we found out Nottingham had refused to come out we were furious, This is the National Union of Mineworkers, if the majority of the National Union of Mineworkers are on strike, they should have come out on strike. Crossing a picket line was a massive thing. I had grown up in an era where you didn't cross picket lines. If people crossed picket lines, they were pariahs in the community. They were scabs, nobody wanted to be labelled a scab. So it was incredible to us that they were crossing picket lines. The underground conditions in Nottingham were very, very good. They were paid well. The Tory's plan was to keep them sweet. They were told a lie, which they swallowed, which was they were going to be kept safe. Should the NUM lose this dispute the cause could well be here. Nottinghamshire's pits are modern, the miners are among the best paid, there isn't the close-nit solidarity of South Yorkshire. Ln Nottingham, their union leaders didn't even know what they wanted. They argued that the strike wasn't valid without a national ballot. They used the ballot as an excuse to keep working. The call for the ballot was trumpeted by the media, Thatcher and MacGregor. There was this idea that only a national ballot counted. This meant one man, one vote, across the country whether your pit was under threat or not. The NUM led by Scargill, was undemocratic, we were intimidatory. That was the basic premise. It's surprising that they were got out on strike without a ballot. Why doesn't Scargill have a ballot? The reason the miners are staying out is they're forced out by the mob. The union's democracy and credibility was being destroyed. A national strike call requiring a ballot is being avoided. What would your views be on the ballot? Mr. Kinnock, can you just tell me what-- To call for a ballot meant you were against the strike. The momentum was on our side, over 80% of miners were on strike. We could not risk calling the whole thing off, a national ballot might have cost us our jobs and our communities. There was a real debate raging on TV, newspapers and in the coalfields. We want to go to work, we haven't voted, we have the right to go. It's morally wrong, when a man can support a ballot vote that makes another man lose his job in Yorkshire or wherever he works. The battle had begun. The time for talking was over. We had to get down to Nottingham and convince our fellow miners that the strike was right, ballot or no ballot. We said, "Does anybody here work in headings?" Yeah", "I work in headings, anybody got kids?" "I've got a kid". Anybody want the pit to stay open?" "Yeah, well we all do." They came out with us. We were winning pit after pit. Because we moved so fast, rank-and-file, we'd caught them with their pants down and we were already into Nottinghamshire. It was great, it was fantastic to put the arguments to them. Picketing was successful until Thatcher sent the police in. About 3,000 extra police were drafted into Nottinghamshire tonight, doubling the county's normal strength. The reinforcements have come from all over Britain. Flying pickets don't make it to the collieries, those that face a new military-style police force, keeping them away from the Nottinghamshire miners. The whole county of Nottingham was completely sealed off by police, the Nottingham miners who stayed on strike were heroic. I'm full of admiration for them, it must have been awful. The police were prepared to stop you going up to the colliery gates, to stop you putting the case to Nottinghamshire miners. - Hi, Gentlemen. - Alright. - Where are you off to? - We're going to Nottingham. - What are you going there for? - We're on business. - I see. What do you do? - I'm a coalface worker. - You're a coalface worker? - Yeah. Would you tell us why you've stopped us? Ln connection with the dispute concerning the miners. ls it lawful to stop us and question us about where we're going? It's lawful for us to stop any motor vehicle that's on the road. - You're absolutely sure about that? - Oh yes. I'm absolutely sure. - Okay. - Don't ask me if I'm sure of the law Turn round at the roundabout and travel north on the A1. If you don't the traffic car will pursue you, you'll be arrested. - For what? - For obstructing the police. I got stopped by the cops at Nottingham, This cop said "What's your name?", I said "Norman Strike", he said "And I'm Arthur Scargill", I said "I'm Norman Strike." He said "Don't believe you."' He had to radio through "He's Norman Strike" I used to carry my birth certificate around to say "Look, Norman Strike." Even to this day people say, "But what's your real name?" And who are you, might I ask? But they never met my mate who was actually called Will Picket. If we carry on to Thoresby colliery we'll be arrested? - Any colliery? - Any colliery you'll be arrested. It became clear that we had to devise a different strategy. It was a game of cat and mouse. To get to the colliery you had to avoid the police with crazy schemes and shenanigans. We used to stop before the roadblock, get out, and pretend we were joggers. Jog past the roadblock and the car would pick us up at the other side. They used to stop cars with four people in them. Two in the boot, one on the back seat, one in the floor well If you were unlucky enough to get in the boot of the car... You'd hear them in the boot saying "What's happening now?" 'We're coming up to a roadblock, don't make a noise, you're going to get us all shopped." If it was afternoon, we'd just pull up to a pub, and have a pint... have a game of darts. You'd get in the car and... what's happening? " " 'Aye, you're alright, we're on our way now, we'll let you out in a bit.' Can we go up there? The motorway? No, turn right here. We got motioned off the motorway at junction 28. Stopped by the police, then we were told to get back and they led us back on to the motorway. We thought, "Buggerthis" so we went abreast on the motorway, drove at 10 miles an hour. The police came, up the hard shoulder, started smashing the windscreens of the vans with truncheons, dragging people out and arresting them. They were absolutely vicious. I was terrified, if I'm honest with you. I never thought I'd see that here, police are supposed to be impartial. I know a nice young policeman, of disposition sweet, all the children greet him as he patrols his beat, impartial on the picket line, to the striker he's a friend, he is stainless, faultless, peerless, conscientious to the end. Oh, dear! Things were starting to hot up, a lot of fighting with police, there were a lot lads getting beatings off police, the temperature was starting to rise, rapidly. It was becoming clear we had a real fight on our hands. This was not going to be any walkover. But for me there was a moment early on in the strike, when it became much more real in terms of what we were involved in. The atmosphere at Ollerton was scary. There were massive police presence, people were hemmed in on pavements, you knew something was really kicking off. Lots of scuffles with the police who were very heavy handed. By this time we were demonised, we were from hell. The local thugs in Ollerton who'd fuelled with alcohol, they were giving the striking miners abuse. There'd been some bricks thrown. Word was coming back that they were smashing all the cars up. My mate Dave Jones, I'd just been chatting to him. He said, "I'm off down here", because his car was down there. As bricks and bottles were hurled David Jones ran towards his car, he was afraid of it being vandalised. And that's it, last time I saw him. Next thing I heard he was dead. For the third night running Yorkshire's pickets stood duty but it ended in tragedy. David Jones, who'd have been 24 today, died. Pickets said he had been hit in the neck by a brick. Ln the melee of the picket line, nothing was clear. This is a strike for God's sake, nobody should die. You don't go on strike to die, and David Jones died. Great lad. From that moment on it was never going to be the same again. His funeral was massive, people came from all over the country. When we talk about unions, Scargill strategies for coal and Thatcher, it's all abstract. But when you turn up to your mate's funeral and there's thousands of trade unionists with their banners dignified, sombre, determined. That's what the union is. That's the union, that's what solidarity is. It's something to behold really, it's something to behold. As we reached summer, it was obvious we weren't going back to Nottingham. One of the major coalfields was still working, it was hurting us. I had no idea how the strike was going to pan out, how to win, but it was clear that we had to do something quick. The Financial Times said "If miners stop coal getting to the steel works car production will stop in three to four weeks. And for us that was a wake-up call. We needed to hit industry by stopping steel. And that meant Orgreave in Yorkshire. It supplied the coke that serviced the steel works. If we could stop steel, it would cut the life blood of the industry. It would have a major, major effect. I'd love to see every single member of my union who's here, every single member who's on strike, every trade unionist supporting us down at the Orgreave-- Every arrow was pointing towards Orgreave, it had to happen. It started in May, setting up a picket. It had to be accelerated, more and more miners turned up. Then the police started to arrive in a big way and it became more difficult to mount that picket. - Move. Get moving. Come on, move. - No way. No way. No way. The police were being provocative, mounting charges. We had to argue with the leaders to send more pickets, in order to ensure it was a victory. They did and the final call came from the union, All pickets to Orgreave." This is an attempt to substitute the rule of the mob for that of law and it must not succeed! JUNE 18, 1984 105 DAYS ON STRIKE If only for moral, we needed a victory, we thought Orgreave was going to be it. Thousands of us went there early on a Monday morning. We left South Wales at midnight on the Sunday night to get up there. I didn't think we were going to walk into what we walked into. It's a day I'll never forget as long as I live. It was an absolutely magnificent day. We had our t-shirts on. We were stripped to the waste from Scotland. This was really incredible weather for us. It was strange. Usually the police stop you and turn you back. On this occasion it was different. They were saying "Come in. Park in that field. You need to go up to there." I knew something was up that day. All I could see in the distance was just lines of cops in a field, and in this field there were policemen with snarling dogs, I could see all these mounted police behind the lines. They knew we were coming and they were ready for us. They were waiting for us; they were waiting for us. When the lorries came the miners' ranks had swelled to more than 5,000. As the last lorry went in, the trouble started. Everything was good natured, it was no more than a total push. We were never, ever getting through in a million years. And so there was nothing happening. Then, all of a sudden, they decided to clear the field. And things changed. It was like a dreadful movie happening in front of you. To think you were in the middle of it. I was at the front and some of the things I witnessed, it was absolutely incredible. Dogs snarling and barking. Police with truncheons and with staves out, looking for people to hit. They had been given carte Blanche to do anything they wanted to us and they did. Get up! Get up! The older fellas couldn't keep up and I passed an old bloke and he was so terrified he was making involuntary noises from his throat. grabbed hold of him and said "Calm down, it's alright." I was trying to keep him calm, afraid he was going to have a heart attack. Then he was physically sick, that's how terrified he was and I'll never forgive them for it. It was madness. People lying on the floor with blood pouring out. The people in the houses put bricks on the wall from their garden stones. We were lobbing them at the police. We heard Scargill had been injured. All I know is this guy hit me on the back of the head with a shield and knocked me to the ground. Somebody set fire to a car and it was just chaos. This wasn't a game, it was us against the armed state. This is what Margaret Thatcher and her government had put into gear. I thought "We're only on strike, " I never thought they would do that. We're not robbing anybody. I can't understand it at all. Figures ranged from something like 5,000 to 7,000 miners. If we'd had 25,000 it'd have been a completely different outcome. Because of the lack of numbers we were walked into a massacre. We didn't have a chance against highly armed, trained policemen. We were there with our shirts wrapped round our middles. It was a turning point, the brutality the violence that was meted out. I realised that you'll never win the state over to your point of view, that these people are our enemies. I remember the face of my father as he walked back home from the mine He'd laugh and he'd say, that's one more day and it's good to feel the sun shine. Take me home, let me sing again. Anybody that was left you were assaulted, charged, arrested. Fortunately for us they're poor liars the police. Not one single miner was found guilty of anything. Get in there and see what they're doing. We wanted to go back, we should have never gone away. We wanted to go back and our union leaders said, No, that one's lost, we're not sending you back in." We tried to say: "We have to go back and try again, take more people this time, " but they wouldn't have it. Tonight's sixty minutes headlines: The worst violence so far on the Orgreave picket lines. And for weeks after it, Orgreave and the miners violence... it was everyplace. "This is the real face of these Luddites." As industrial relations descent to scenes of riot... The worst violence of the strikes so far... They were hurling rocks and stones and bottles... - In no way is this picketing. - They are breaking the law. It made an impression on me that if they could do that and get away with it, the miners be vilified as the cause of the violence it meant we were really in trouble. We took Orgreave on the chin but we weren't down and out. We were prepared to go full 15 rounds, never mind going down on to our knees in the fourth round, and staying down. We got up, we were spurred on to do better, to do more to win the strike. We couldn't act on our own, we needed support from the rest of the movement like we'd never needed it before. One of the things the Tories were terrified about was action spreading from the miners to other groups of workers. Throughout that whole year they did their best to offer workers, whether it was health or rail workers, electricians, slightly above the expected pay rise. Liverpool city council got a better deal than they expected. These were all fronts we'd been hoping might open up and help us beat Thatcher. There were still opportunities, like the dock strikes. If there was workers the Tories wanted to beat as much as the miners, it was the dockers. But deals were cobbled up, and the chance was lost. We know for a fact we were set up to be taken on by the government, the only reason they're not provoking us at the moment with the attacks on the national dock labour scheme, is that they want to deal to the miners first. Every week that came could have seen the end of the strike, There was no planning ahead. The miners knew that there weren't only us feeling the pinch, there were ten million plus strong trade union movement out there. The longer the strike went on the more chance that another significant group of workers was going to challenge the government for their own ends. The problem was that we needed money, claiming social security benefits was very difficult. Laws were changed. It had been a long time since anyone had been paid. If we were going to remain on strike, winter was coming, we had a 150,000 miners and their families on strike so we had to turn to our colleagues in the working class, to all sorts of people. Thankfully there were support groups sprung all over the country. It was inspiring, it was incredibly inspiring. THEY SHALL NOT STARVE SOGAT '82 SUPPORTS THE MINERS The first thing that needs to be said is hatred's all very well But hatred must be organised if dreams are to be realised And anger is no substitute for disciplined rebellion To unionise is to organise Unionise! Fight back! Unionise! Stop! Strike! Unionise! Unionise! It's difficult to conceive the huge impact the strike had on our culture it really divided the country. It kind of drove a wedge between people, you were either for the miners or against them. There was many connections. Many had been battered by this government so when they were taking on the miners, people understood this was a life or death struggle in terms of what happens here, ls it going to be the rich getting richer or the poor getting poorer? Why did students identify with workers fighting back? Well, if you're young, you're meant to be rebellious, aren't you? What the miners were experiencing was similar to what we were. We were used to the media telling lies about lesbians and gay men, to the police harassing us, to the courts being used against us. What the miners were going through we could identify with completely. There was the question of turning the sympathy and that passive support into something more. As well as collecting money and food, we also stood on the picket lines But I'm sure when the miners saw us they probably thought understandably, Very nice of you to come but do we really need your help?" I mean, hundreds of burley miners in front of you, and say possibly not but another side thought, "Why are these people identifying with us?" We built up respect by turning up and being alongside them. Other miners and industrial workers tended to look down on students as lazy good for nothings-Yeah. But I always I admired students, they were something that I wasn't, they were intellectual, they were educated in a way I could never be. I went to York University to sway the student union to donate a bus to go picketing in. I went to the university thinking, "God, I'm out of my depth here, I'm going to be speaking to them and I'll come over as a buffoon, with my cloth cap and my begging bowl asking for money. But I found out it wasn't like that. Ln a way I was their equal and it was a big personal moment for me. That I could hold my own in debate, it was quite a seminal moment for me. Support the miners! When we'd collected about 500 quid, we had to ponder about where to send it and this lad said "Why not my community?" and we just went "Alright, what's it called and where is it?" Ln that part of South Wales it's pits and sheep. We were quite conspicuous. 27 lesbians and gays from London. We were wearing what you might call charity shop chic, nobody had any money but we got style. We'd been invited to meet at the local miners welfare hall, and it's a big welfare hall, the Onllwyn miners welfare. This was another one of those things that will always stick in my mind as one of the proudest moments in my life when we walked into the hall, there were already people in there, every generation, grandmas, granddads, kids, as we walked in... the volume of people chatting away dropped... and it was a really tense moment for a second or two. Because we knew what that was a response to us walking in the room. Somebody started clapping, and then everybody started clapping. Every hair stood up on my body, I thought "We're making history." Also, for me personally, I come from that working class background, it did feel like coming home for me-- it, it... whoops, here we go I just felt like that acceptance, that's all I ever wanted. It was fantastic, and it strengthened you even more. I thought, "To stop me supporting the miners, you'll have to kill me because... I'm there now completely." It was a beacon. It attracted people, they wanted to show solidarity, because they'd experienced gay, racial or female oppression, could find an expression by working with people in struggle. Women were pushed to do things they never thought they would do. By going out and collecting money, it was an opportunity almost to speak at meetings, to go out on the streets and people wanted to listen and that had never happened before. Miners' wives are as determined as any Margaret Thatcher’s, she will not beat us. You think your life is normal and suddenly your life is not normal. And you realise there's a big world out there. If anyone had told me last year... that I would be going around marching, going to conferences, speaking in front of people, I'd have thought they were crazy. But this strike of 1984 got more than me motivated. We knew what our men were doing was right, and so women have risen up... into... and organised themselves, and we'll never be the same again. Not even when this is won we'll never be the same again. Because win it, we will. Prior to the strike, when I would go to the working men's club, I used to be ignored. The only words spoken to me were "Another drink? During the strike the guys would say "Where've you been picketing?" What happened on the picket lines?" You were being involved with miners some of whom didn't even go on the picket line. A lot were left to run the house while we went and did our own thing. I was going places I never went, meeting people I'd never have met. Like people from the arts and... they're far removed from us. Or, that's what we thought. They offered to come on, we'll put a show on here, raise funds just to raise the profile and [INDISTINCT], you can't knock them man. A journalist got in touch with me from the New Musical Express. He had a band called The Redskins. Norm, " he said, "we're on the tube, do you want to come along?" I said " yeah." We composed this speech about how many miners had been arrested, despite that people were supporting us all over the country. I was nervous, my legs shaking. I'm banging the tambourine and then Chris says: "And on strike for 35 weeks, a Durham miner," and I made my speech. We found out they'd switched the mike off and nothing had gone out live, which really pissed me off. I go back to the green room where you can have a triple Southern Comfort, or a bottle of whisky. I'd been on strike for 35 weeks. I'm drinking triple Southern Comforts trying to get the lager down as well Holland said: "They're complaining about "Why did they censor him?" If you told us-" I said "Fuck off you little twat." Victory to the miners! And then I was thrown out. We can't afford to sit down without supporting the miner's cause. When you're fighting to protect jobs, it's not only a case of fighting for the wages it's a fighting for the right to work. That's why you find every community all supporting the miners' cause. Solidarity shown to us by working people of this country, it's absolutely fantastic. Not just the level or the amounts but the way it was given. Pensioners dropping their pension book in a collection tin, and having to say "I've got a mother. You can't afford this." There was this tramp who came up to us and he opened his purse and he had nine pence, nine pence! He gave us five pence and he kept the four pence for a cup of coffee. So I went in the bucket, I got a handful of coins out I said "Take this. You need it more than we do" And I gave him, gave him a handful of change I've started to fill up. Avery emotional time that, very emotional time. He said "Keep the fight up." Something you can't forget. Can we move on to the main issue which is the miner's dispute? You said that you thought it would run a little while yet, how long do you think it's going to run now? I don't know how much longer it will run, I don't feel it'll be settled immediately. It has been a very long time. ls the government prepared to sit out however long this strike will take? If any group of people, or any government, gave in to violence and intimidation of this kind there'll be no future for democracy or for any moderate trade unionist if we were to give in to that. ls this what you meant by 'the enemy within'? This kind of violence should never have happened. It is the work of extremists, it is the enemy within. Forget the propaganda and rhetoric that Thatcher came out with. Not only was she wobbling, but the markets were wobbling. The media were saying "She could lose this one." We knew we’d got to up our game. The money and the food parcels were great, very grateful for them but what we really wanted was the trade unionists to go on strike. Ln September that year the TUC was meeting, where all the trade union leaders were going to get together. We hoped they'd see the sense of it and finally force Thatcher to back down. We hadn't stopped Nottingham We hadn't stopped Nottingham we needed solidarity from other workers, it was our chance. Scargill gets up. Standing ovation. No problem. We all support you. Ahem, financially. Despite all the applause, they didn't call for strike action. I just knew it was the kiss of death. If they were serious they'd have challenged the anti-trade union laws. But they weren't serious. The leaders supported miners but wanted to negotiate their way out. But the Coal Board under the tutelage of MacGregor under his authority; didn't want to negotiate. That was an opportunity missed, absolutely, absolutely. I'd love to see the TUC get off the fence and do some business. I know shouldn't be saying it but they should, they should really show solidarity with the miners. Because if they lose, we've all lost. There will be no going back. The Trade Union Congress said to me that we're going to struggle to win. Something would drastically have to go wrong for MacGregor. It would have to be an accident at that point. NACODs, deputies, these are like the foreman in a factory taking care of safety, organising work at the same time. NACODS weren't part of the dispute, but they got paid for staying at home NCB sends out a circular, talk about stupid... NCB sends out a circular, instructing them to turn up at pits. Because pits open if there's one working miner attend. And you've got to go through the picket lines, you've got to attend your place of work. That threw them in a spin. None at NACODs wanted this, lots of them lived in pit communities. They lived close enough to see the damage that was being done. We made it our aim to go out and see individual deputies. said to them "This is your chance, these are your communities, you have more in common with us than with a Tory in Downing Street. They had to have a response and they did. Number of votes cast 'for': 11658 Number of votes 'against': 2400- Percentage of the votes in favour of strike was 92.5% Out on strike by Monday. The cat was amongst the pigeons. Thatcher saw what was happening. There will be recriminations getting tough with the deputies backfired. NACODs has now given the NUM enormous support over the issue. When NACODs said "it's a strike, " it was a national strike. Even the few pits in Nottingham would have shut. So it'd done our job for us, it would have shut the pits. NCB and LAN MacGregor dropped a right bollock there. It was an opportunity like no more. One of their leaders went in to this meeting he was just going to pull them out, it was like: this is it. I remember watching the news thinking "It's really going to happen." He went in to this meeting and he came out and said: The NEC expressed satisfaction with the result of those negotiations and agreed to call off the strike, due on Thursday the 25th of October. - Unconditionally Mr McNefferey - It's off. What can I say about him? We picked up like that and we were flattened like that. They negotiated different terms; NACODs called their strike off. They'd come up with some new review procedure for pit closures. As if that was going to alter the government's plan to close pits. It was enough for them to call off the strike, and they kept working and thinking they were going to be safe. UNITED WE STAND DIVIDED WE FALL After the failure of another strike to materialise, we felt that cold wind of isolation. There were those who thought the miners could win it on their own we were a breed apart etc. They continued with the illusion, We can go it alone, in the face of all material facts. We can go it alone and come out triumphant in the end." Thatcher smelt blood after the TUC conference. She was determined to press home her advantage. It was clear that the miners were going to be left isolated. Thatcher could see that, everybody could see that. The state stepped in and really tightened the grip. The government tried to do whatever they could to demoralise us. The court seized our union assets, miners on bail were banned off picket lines up and down the country. You've got hundreds arrested and some had been sacked. On top of that you've got the media, courts, police chiefs, politicians. For us, at the centre of it, it sent like we were bang, slap in the middle of a war with our own government. We haven't been fighting pit closures, but the government they're determined to smash the trade union movement. Once they've smashed the NUM, they'll go through the others. We had no idea where this was going. I mean... it was only when the picketing started to get quite bad. You knew that everybody had to do more. This idea blossomed that women could have a picket of their own. Maybe the police wouldn't be as vicious if women went. Bu it didn't turn out that way. Glory, glory oh you miners Stand together, not divided Together we will win and we'll stop MacGregor LAN And we'll all go marching on! Disperse. Go away. Disperse. Clear the area. You're arresting a woman. [INDISTINCT] The forces are capable of terrible things, the police, the government, you know that these forces have the power but it's not until you're faced with it that it becomes this scary thing. And I think that's what... one of the real issues with people... was other parts of the country didn't realise that. They didn't realise that they were breaking the law, that the police and the government were breaking the laws. The enormity of it. Going to a picket line to see riot police, now they were parked at the end of your street, they were following you home from the pub on a weekend. They were permanently around and for us it felt like a siege. Some villages just got locked down, they sent in thousands of them. The government was throwing everything that they had at us. I see somebody marching Marching down the street, yeah. I see somebody marching. Marching down the street. This time we stop and pray... to have a better day. I see somebody marching. Marching Marching down the street, yeah. I hear somebody crying. Crying. Crying in the street. I hear somebody praying. They're down on their knees 266 DAYS ON STRIKE It was winter. It was cold. People hadn't got much fuel left. People were chopping down trees and scavenging for bits of coal... We didn't get anything for a year. To have an idea of what it was like, get your salary and don't touch it for a year and see how you get on. That's what it was for us, we had nothing. My granny tells me that she's seen it all before and at 94 she's seen a thing or two She's seen the stockbrokers crying and the speculators sighing and the millionaires relying on a war to pull them through. And they're turning the clock back and I can hear my granny say, Yes, they're turning the clock back and the working man will pay... One chap came to the strike centre in tears. He didn't have anything, he was struggling with everything. And that was the case everywhere. People were struggling. They had nothing in the cupboard, they had no fire in the grate, they're having these heavy letters and they can't see no way out of it. It was just amazing to think that men had been out for so long. They had mortgages, car loans, kids. They had Christmas to think about. They had all sorts of things, they gave up everything for a year, they ran their cars into the ground, the effect it must have had on individual relationships. They were trying to starve us back to work and that's why after ten months some of the men did crack, some people couldn't take it anymore. There was a lad I worked with down at the pit. He was on the picket lines with me, he went to Orgreave and everything. His marriage was breaking up, he's in mountains of debt. He came into the soup kitchen, had his dinner, walked out, went to work. He said 'I 've got a wife and three kids, " I said " Same here. I've got the same, we've all got wife and kids. we've all got families to support but we're not scabbing." You scab, you should be ashamed of yourselves! That was all really messy and heart-breaking. Scabs, scabs! People wanted to think that the strike was crumbling. It was gutted wasn't I? Things seemed to be getting desperate, out of hand. People didn't want to give in, they wanted to go... How could you give in? Because what was left? What else is there in this community apart from mining? There's nothing. There is absolutely nothing to do. That's why we're going to fight, we'll fight, and we shall win. I'm absolutely convinced of that. It's worth fighting to try and get jobs for your children Anywhere you go, young kids leaving school and there's no jobs, it’s just hopeless for them. I don't want that for mine. They'll end up on the dole. if they shut the pits down. Human beings get tired but organisations don't. TO MINERS STILL ON STRIKE They were adding pressure, both financially and psychologically. Every way they possibly could. The pit manager offered me 500 quid if I went back to work on Monday They'd pay for a holiday, they'd pay your debts for you you know, if you'd just back to work. It was like somebody dying of thirst, offering them a drink of water, and all you'd got to do was cross a picket line. It made lots of people angry, others thought it was the last straw. And they'd gulp their pride back, and they'd turn up for the bus to go back to work. According to the national coal board, a further 218 miners returned today. That brings the week's total to 2,870, and a total of nearly 6,000 since the resumption of work. You used to have on the news everyday: the background to the presenter was "31 pits working, 32 pits working, " if one miner went in with his dog, they would be deemed to be working. A massive police escort signalled the arrival of a green coach carrying just one man, back to work for the first time at the small-- Almost unnoticed, Cortonwood's lone miner was escorted into the pit. A deliberate police tactic to guarantee his safety. National news, one more man going to work. That's what they were trying to do, to chip away and chip away. That was part of the NCB strategy. They wanted to show that not only was Nottinghamshire not going to come out that the strike was crumbling in Yorkshire, Wales and Scotland. We'd be only talking about handfuls of men. A pit employing 2,000 men might have four people go back to work. The NCB are confident by the end of week there'll be men in every pit in the Northumberland - Durham coalfield. The pickets tried to turn out in force but the strike is over. The men will start to come back and in big numbers. You bastards! They were sending coaches in. You thought, "50 in that bus, plus but there wasn't, there'd be three in that bus, two in the bus behind and nobody in the bus behind that. The board says another 128 miners returned to work today. A dramatic rise in the number of NUM members at work. The NCB points to men returning to work in all 12 areas. They might as well say, "Out of 181,000, 203,000 have returned to work." They were claiming so many miners had returned back to a coal mine and it had been closed about 20 years before that. The coal board can't say how much more coal, if any, has been produced- There was no trouble as the buses carrying 200 men into the colliery. The pit manager says he's getting calls from miners wanting to return. His relief that production has restarted is evident. It was announced that another 99 new starters reported for work. Work at Ellington brought the total to 470, That's 380 more-- Scene of the most violent clashes, three quarters of the NUM workforce-- Return to work continues, strikers may soon be a minority. It's not just numbers that count. The volume of it got so loud, like somebody screaming in the corner Really angry, "Why don't you get back to work?". Everything's against you, you've lost, go back to work." There's no way we can win now. No chance. The vast majority of the men want to come back to work. It's not fair on your families to be without fuel, money at Christmas, you’ve just got to make up your mind and you're going back to work. It was unsustainable even if there was only 55 working miners at my pit you could see that the writing was on the wall. Each time they go in, it's them that are knocking us down. There's no way the board is going to meet us on any terms as long as these people are going in. And for them to keep saying "These are the people, " is rubbish, these people are slashing everybody's throats. One minute you were thinking "We're going to win" and then "Oh god, we're going to lose." We definitely could have won if we'd had support from other unions led by Norman Wallace, Len Murray and other trade unionists We could have won in January and in March. Absolutely no doubt. You can make arguments to a thinking head, I was talking to empty bellies, tired men and women, who'd been beaten. It seems that meeting will finally order the remaining strikers back. MARCH 3, 1985 363 DAYS ON STRIKE The feeling in that conference today is very clear... that we go back on Tuesday, we go back together this union fights to retain pits, jobs and communities. The movement, with a few exceptions, left this union isolated, to their eternal shame. We faced not an employer, but a government, aided and abetted by the judiciary, the police and you people in the media. At the end of this time, our people are suffering tremendous hardship. It has been the considered view of conference, by a very narrow vote, that we should return on Tuesday and continue the fight. I remember I was having a little nap, my partner coming up to me in tears. You'll have to-- Sad time, sad time. Some of us thought it would go on forever, and I didn't mind. I didn't mind at all, I'm not saying it was fun, but... I got a really, really lovely feeling of being able to have a bash at the state. I don't think there is words to put it into... Sorry. I think it was anger. I think it was knowing that... she'd won. These evil, vicious, pitiless people... had won, and... looking into the future was a bit bleak. The day that lads went back, they had the lodge banner and the band. They all marched in and I stood and watched them. They went to get changed, I went to the office, handed my notice in. My marriage was over, my marriage broke up in November, it was a shock. I was happily married with kids when the strike started and unhappily married... I had to move out the family home so she could get social security, because she'd be a single mum. I didn't want my marriage to end, I didn't want to leave my kids. I didn't want to be defeated, and... I was. But, if I had my time over again I'd do the same thing. It's more important than my marriage, more important than my life. It was the future of the trade union movement in this country. We were right, we lost, but we were right. Coal executives delivering the worst message on the future of the industry While they spoke of job losses and pit closures, thousands of miners in Britain waited to hear their fate. 30,000jobs are to be lost and 31 pits will cease production. Five pits exist in the North-East, four are to go leaving just one. Pits in Yorkshire will be halved by the closure of 11 collieries. The same applies to Nottingham: 13 now but seven are to go. There are eight pits in the Midlands and North-West, six will be axed. Wales has four and three are going, leaving just one. Ln Scotland its single mine remains open. - It's a waste of talent, resources. - What will you do? Struggle, same as everybody else. It's devastating, you know it is. Not a lot we can do. 27 years in the pit, on the dole now. Like most Nottinghamshire miners John Brown worked through the strike. Today he says Scargill was right. He'd seen this coming. Our union must wear blindfolds. They never told us this is going to happen. He predicted it years ago, we should have listened to Arthur. We got beat, we got beat. And... we paid a heavy price. Ln 10 years they'd shut nearly every pit down that was worth talking about. The mining industry wiped out. That was their endgame. They were prepared to lose an industry to defeat that beacon of hope that organised group of workers, a beacon to millions of workers all over the world. It's 30 years since the strike and I am so angry. I'm probably angrier now than I was at the time. We live in a country that produces absolutely nothing. What it's meant for generations of working people in these villages. It wasn’t just us that was beat, families were destroyed. The number of guys I've known that committed suicide. I'm so angry. And it could have been different. There was a man at the pit who, when they shut the pit, went to his house with petrol, poured it over himself and set fire to it. They'd shut his pit down and he couldn't face it. It was more than a defeat for the miners, it was a defeat for trade unionism in Britain. If miners lost, then what chance have we? That rippled out throughout the working class institutions. We were the enemy of the state and political elites, we recognised they wanted to tame the trade unions so they wouldn't interfere with profit making. It was about defeating the miners so they could boost their profits when the miners were defeated, we're suffering from that defeat. record levels of unemployment, wages being driven down, conditions, ridden roughshod over, they're the scars of defeat. It wasn’t just coal mines that were closed, all sorts of factories and breweries, everything was closed down. 30 years later they talk about how much social security is costing. These people haven't worked for two generations, "Whose fault's that?" All the things that have happened can be traced back the Great Strike, that we lost and we should never have lost it. One union, rail workers, dockers, if just one union had joined us, we would have won that strike. But we didn't and our defeat changed everything for the next three decades. INDUSTRIAL DECLINE JOB LOSSES LEADING BRITAIN INTO THE 1990S Ln the British economy, there will be no no-go areas for free enterprise. PRIVATISATION TIMETABLE BRITISH GAS ENERGY IS OUR BUSINESS One question about privatisation is how prices will be regulated. POWER BILLS WILL SOAR UNTIL 2030 The shares in privatised industries pushed the stock exchange- Does enterprise and liberty rise from the dead ashes of state control? The assets sold read like a roll call from Britain's industrial heritage. We've laid the economic foundations of a decent and prosperous future. FTSE SEEN OPENING HIGHER 5,000 JOBS AXED IN BANK CRASH PEOPLE BEFORE PROFIT THOU SHALT NOT STEAL With the knowledge of the past we can try to do something about the future. Our strike shone as a beacon, that even if the state is against you you can fight back. And that side of it has lingered on, they've not defeated us, we've lost a battle, not the war. It's certainly not beautiful, it’s just scrub land really, isn't it? I don't feel sad about losing machinery and conveyor belts. It's what that machinery meant and what it enabled us to do. That runs through the veins of the communities and it's lost. That's what happens when you lose, if we'd won, it'd have been different If we'd won it'd have been a better world for everybody. It definitely would have been a better world for everybody. Who knows, come back in 100 years and things might be different. The future's still up for grabs.
