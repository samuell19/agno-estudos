While listening to the song of the bird I'll dance the polka again today A favorite old man in the mountain Always use a stylish red shirt While listening to the song of the bird I'll dance the polka again today If you call down the deep valley The song that you call will rebound Gathering friends in the mountain I'll dance the polka again today Wind I'm asking you to do both shoulders. So stiff. Tap my back also. -Please do it on my neck. -Here? Grandma, it smells like tobacco. Were you smoking? -It's because grandma caught a cold. -But you will prolong the cold. What should we do about the water? Go take a look at it. -Look at this grandma. -What? -My height is exactly 1.60m now. -That's not important now. -I couldn't make it until now. -Let's talk about that later. Rather than that, hurry up and turn off the water. Grandma, I'm leaving now. Sleep well, okay? You still have a fever so don't smoke okay! Good morning! Sacchan, good morning! Morniiiiing! We will have an English test today, right? Just kidding, homework homework... This is an important time. No, not only now. From now on, there will be times in which everyone has to face difficulties. That's why now, at this time. Please value this day. That's all that I can say as your teacher. Please do your best with and keep in mind... Really?! I saw that... Me too Hey! Noisy! It's time for you to focus on your studies for the exam next year. Study at night instead of doing other activities. -I had that dream too. Hey, have you heard about the dream? At first, it seemed like they were talking about the dream... -After that... -Continue. They all saw the same woman in their dreams and were shocked because of that. It's exactly the same dream I had yesterday. -It's hard to believe... -Tell me more. What are you talking about? Stand up! -Well. -What's that about?! It's about the dream. We were talking about the dream. It seems like everyone had the same dream yesterday. Besides that.. I also had that dream. -Sachiko? -Yes, I'm surprised. So all of you had the same dream yesterday. Yes. I had forgotten about that dream until my classmates reminded me of it. No way, are you saying I had the same dream too? I'm not sure about that... Say it. In the dream, there is a road leading to Nanja Monja Forest. I was walking alone in my dream. But in my classmates' dreams, it was them who were walking. Right? Obviously, Sachiko would never be in my dreams. Be quiet! -Then? -And then.. Someone was coming from the other side. I can't remember her face. This person approached me and gave me a windmill. When I looked back, that person was gone. And then... The windmill that she gave me suddenly... Close the window, please. Sachiko, you can sit now. Open the book on page 74. Obviously I also had that dream. (On the way home) Not only that... By the way... I don't feel this is just a dream, a long time ago... I feel like it is real. Yes, I really feel like it's real. Hey, what's wrong? The place you're looking for is over there. Go straight. It's a bit far. No problem for me because I walk every day. There's a shrine in the forest, right? It's good to be there. That's why I want to go there. I see. You're going to the Sisters shrine. -Then, take care. -Thanks. Good bye. I'm home. I'm home! Grandma? -Grandma. Grandma!? -Look at this, got it for free. -What about your cold? -I'm fine. -There's a note for you from your sister. -Really? Sorry I didn't tell you before. Sister! Hello. Sister! Yo! Are you okay? Hey, how are you? What happened? -I'll go back tomorrow. -Really?! Yo! Are you okay? It's been a long time, right? Handy, right? I didn't bring much. -Big sis, you didn't change at all. -But that's good, right? You too, you didn't change. Don't say such thing. Wait for me, be careful.. We are talking about so many things. Just girl things. Especially sister to sister things. Anyway, I am happy that big sis didn't change. Her personality is still so bright and she's still talkative but that's how she should be. We arrived! Finally! It feels good. -About what? -To be here. (saying the address) Oh really. You arrived. Thinking about that, I'm not sure either it was a dream or not. (grandma is talking about the time since her husband died, in which something happened that now seems like a dream) Wow, this is an amazing dream. Talking about the windmill and the forest fairy.. Move. As expected big sis, because this is your room, right? Let's continue. A forest fairy with a windmill appears. A forest fairy? There's a small path in Nanja Monja Forest and I got a windmill there. When I was walking back home alone, suddenly the windmill was spinning. Everyone in my class had the same dream. Isn't it strange? Nothing has changed in this room since I was a teenager. You are not listening to me? -I had that dream too. -No way. It's a turning point. -You are talking nonsense again. -Then help me to clean up. -I will probably move here. -You are moving back here? It's a turning point. A turning point.., anyway, are you really moving back here, sis? Why are you so busy? Ayako, this is all your stuff. Here is the Nanja Monja Forest. In this small forest lives Fu-Chan the wind. The stormy winds protect the villagers and their rice fields. We trust Fu-Chan to protect village. I wonder if that was Fu-Chan. -Show me the Nanja Monja Forest later. -Yeah let's go. Let's go. I will go back tomorrow and prepare all things to move back here. I will go out at 7am. That's good because I will also go out at that time. Okay, good night. Good night. That night there was no wind fairy in my dream. I wonder how old will I be when the fairy comes into my dream again. -It arrived. -See you again. -You're late. -Sorry. What's wrong? -I'm fine. -Really? Good morning! Did you know? -What? -Right now, my mom's belly is big. -You will become a sister? -What? You will become a sister! Congratulations! You will have a younger brother. Thank you. No one saw the big spaceship over the brown house. No one saw the little orange man. Only, Pete saw them. Then, he saw it. A light in the sky. It was like a very big star. It was coming towards here. He closed his eyes. No one saw the big spaceship over the brown house. No one saw the little orange man. Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Ayako. A favourite old man in the mountain Always using a stylish red shirt While listening to the song of the bird I'll dance the polka again today
