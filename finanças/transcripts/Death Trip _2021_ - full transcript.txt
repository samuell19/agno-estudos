You're so special. I can't even see. I think you have lipstick all over your mouth. I probably do too. I don't know. Is it that bad? It's not bad. I love you so much. So special. Fucking love you, Kelly. Nobody makes me feel like this. ♪ This is my church tonight ♪ You are my church tonight ♪ Are you my God? ♪ Kelly. Come on, wake up. Kelly. Kelly. Kelly. Kelly. Kelly. Kelly. I'm awake! Garrett's gonna be here in five. Let's go. Kelly. Garrett's gonna be here in five minutes. You know he's a stickler for this kind of shit. So, we got this fucking new guy at work. The guy's name is DJ. You know those dudes from Vancouver? They're all the same, you know? They just want to smoke weed and skate and smoke weed and skate. This guy he calls in sick yesterday. I have to cover his shift. I'm walking home, after service, I see this guy skating. Wow. Where's, uh, where's Glenn? Oh, that's another fucking thing. Dramatic. I don't know. He just, like, has to work this weekend all of a sudden, which is very convenient. He has to work, he has to work, you know? Yeah, whatever, but, like, it's the emotional aspect that's, hurt... I'm allowed to feel bad about it. Why are you taking... Of course you are. Why are you taking his side? - A lot of times... - Is this, uh... This is the place right here? It's coming up. Yeah. Right there. Yeah, she's ready. I'm gonna go get her, okay? - You excited? - Yeah... yeah. It's gonna be fun. It's gonna be really fun. Okay. All right. Let's go. I think actually to call it a cottage is a bit disparaging. It's a chalet. Oh! Wow. That's a bit too much. There are toilets. There is running water. Are we talking about, like, an outside toilet, though? Is that what this is? We're not talking about outside toilet. We're talking about an inside toilet. Okay. I'm sorry. I haven't been here before. And the last time we went there was, like, ten years ago, - so things could have changed... - It was not ten years... - Yes, it was. - It was seven. It was ten years ago, yeah. - And you drove up in the same car? - Yeah. - It's actually a van. - "Technically" This van got me quite a bit of "attention" in high school. MELINA, TATYANA & KELLY: Oh! See what I'm saying. Just, like, your mom, your sister. - What the fuck? - What the fuck happened? Uh-oh. But we're in the country. What happened? We're stuck. - Oh, shit. I mean... - I'm sure it's fine. This car's, like, really old. As long as we're not here for, like, hours on end. And, like, the people around here are friendly, right? Yeah. But, like, when are "they" gonna be here? When are they coming up here? Well, that was my concern. Just someone passing by and seeing just three clearly city womens. "City women." - Do you need help? - Naw. It's all good. I got this. Okay. Yes! See? - It worked. - It's worth opening. All right. Ingenuity. Who is that guy? That's just Bruce Kingsley. He lives next door. He's also watching us. He's a good guy. Is everything okay? Do you think it's, like, kinda weird... Like, being back here after what happened last time? It was a long time ago. What are they doing? Hey! - MELINA & TATYANA Garrett! - Guys, guys, guys. No, okay. There are people that live here. We can't just, like... - Who? - Who lives here? We didn't see any car. The Kingsleys live right next door, um, the Bowins live up the road... All those names sound fake. No, they're real people. They're real people, okay? Okay. Okay. All right, this is the place. It's, uh, pretty simple, you know? Cottage-y... - Wow. - Um, yeah. There's... So, uh, we got one room here. Couple of bunk beds. You can share that room. This is my room. It's, like, my... Y'know. It's a bit embarrassing, but... Over here, there's the, uh, master bedroom. It's the largest room in the house. Um, there's just... There's one thing about it, is that my grandfather did pass away a couple months ago. - Oh. - In this room? Yeah. He died in his sleep, so it's not... That doesn't make it... It's not haunted or anything. Someone's got to sleep there. We'll figure it out. - I vote you. - It's not going to be me. - It's haunted. It's a haunted room. - He died in the room? Okay, okay, okay! We're gonna... We're gonna draw straws. Okay. Okay, let's do it. Oooh. Oh, no, Kelly. That sucks. I feel like Melina was a great sous-chef. - Thank you. - I think... That is incorrect. Maybe, like, a great dishwasher/part-time prep... Wow. Gets fired a week after... I'm sorry not all of us can be a line cook at a trendy restaurant, Garrett. - Jesus Christ. - Hey! I'm... They've been scouting me for sous-chef. - Oh, yeah? - "Scouting you"? - What does that even mean? - Did you get "scouted"? - Tina told me that, uh, some people... - "Tina". Were talking about, uh, me being... Me being sous-chef. - Tina's a liar. - Tina just wants in your pants, Garrett. Tina's not a liar. I think that she has a crush on him. Oh, absolutely. Tina's been eyeing you... Look at him. He's so excited. - Is she 17? - Stop. - You are the latest... - Tina is a friend of mine. She's, like, 12. She's so young looking. - Maybe I'm wrong. I don't really know her. - She's not. She's 18. Oh, my God! - No, she's 18. - That's unacceptable. - That's gross. That's fucked up. - Legally, she's allowed to make up her own mind. - Ohh... kay! - Guys, come on. Hey! What are you... What are you doing? You can't smoke that in here. You just called me like a dog. No, no, no. - Get out. No, you gotta take it outside. - Relax! Relax! Melina! - This is my parents' cottage. - She's getting wild. This isn't your, like, loft you know? This isn't, uh... You can't just kick back in the bean bag chair. Relax, relax. I'm no Tina, but, uh... Tina can take a lesson from this one. - Hey! - Come on... - You're, like, polar opposites. - Noisy shit, like... - Right. - But, like, it's, like, I understand, like, inherently, you can only really get down with the two step and that's fine. - Give us some m... Yep! No. - Oh, my God. It's just too erotic. I can't even look. See, that is why I cultivate my life, so that I don't have to see... - Oh, my God. No, no, no, no. - ...things like that. - Thank you. - You're welcome. You know, I'm just being vulnerable. I'm being, uh... Guys, guys, guys. You guys gotta come. - What? - Why? - It's... - What... what? I'm not gonna spoil the surprise, okay? See, I told you it was worth it. She should know that we can see her. This is insane. You know what? Maybe she knows and she just doesn't care. I like that. I like that narrative. - I think that's fine. - I like her. - What do you think her story is? - What's the deal? 100% she works at Tim Hortons, like, down the road. Totally. And you know what? Honestly, she would, uh, look cute in that uniform. I wonder who she is. - I wonder what her life is like. - That's, uh, that's Megan. - You know her? - She's Bruce's daughter. Her, uh, her family would go to this cottage for the summer when, uh, my family was here... And then, like, around 13, her mom died... And they moved back here to live permanently. And when I came back the next summer, she didn't want anything to do with me. Oh? It's crazy and the weirdest thing is that there's all these rumors that her dad killed her mom... - Oh. - Are you serious? Yeah, it was, like, a really fucked up... Fucked up situation. You know, I can... I can see it. I can see it in, like, her... in her hair - You can see it in her hair? - It's just, like, murder, murder, murder? - She's definitely a Leo cusp. - No. - No way. Leo Capricorn cusp? - I like it. - Rising. - There's no way. - You are full of shit. - She's way too bashful to be a Leo. - Are you kidding me? - What's like a shy sign? I feel, like, she's, like, a Taurus? Look at her, she's obviously a Libra. Like, there's a fire, like, a stubborn... Has this never happened to her before? Like, she's at a window. I would like to think that she does know that it's happening... You guys! Look at this! She doesn't care. - Oh, my God. - You're having a moment. You love her, too! - Guys, guys. Let's get inside. - Garrett. - We are guests. She lives here. Get inside. - I love her. - Get inside. - It's so cute, though. - We love her. - You love Megan. I love Megan. We all love Megan. - Hi Mom. - Hey, it's Garrett. - How's it going? - Good. - You know what I was thinking we should do? We should unplug. - And bonding. - No. - No, I read this in O Magazine. - O Magazine? - We take our phones... Yeah, yeah. - ...in the potty bucket by the back door under the porch. - Yeah. - There's also a full bottle of water under the sink. - Yeah. - And one in the back shed. - Why? - I won't. - I'll let them know about the water. It's automatic. You won't even entertain me with the idea? We're in the middle of the woods. You're telling me I can't have my phone? - Come on. - I'm not gonna do that. What if there's an emergency? - I need GPS. - Yes! - GPS? - GPS. 911. We need emergency services. - Guys, come on. - Basic services. Yeah. Yeah. Everything's fine. Yeah and I'll... I'll close everything up, uh, properly. I know, Mom. I know the drill. Yes, we will. Also, I know it seems like a lot, but I love you so much. Okay. I love you. I don't want to ruin your whole trip by talking forever. I love you. Okay, bye. So, we are playing Ride the Bus. Primarily a game of chance, ends up being a game of revenge. - This sounds terrifying. - It will work. Someone just tell me when to drink and I'll be fine. Okay, I'll tell you. - W-w-w-we'll figure it out. - We'll figure it out. Pick up your cards. Let's go! - Go! - "Queen". Yeah, perfect. - No! - Yes! There you go. Wow. It's kind of one whole drink or one half a drink? - Just sip on it. - Just do it. - Yeah, there you go. There you go. - All right. - Oh! - Oh! One. Two. Go. Go. Go. Go. Makes sense, like, two and two is four is eight is 12 is poker. Yeah, like, with card counting, you know? Kelly, what do you think? What do you think? - Magic card people, do they ever meet? - We're starting a school. The House of Magic? The big one. This is four drinks. Oh, my God. I don't think I'm gonna do... Oh! Wrong again! Drink. Drink. Drink. Drink. Hey. Hey! Get out! Get... I told you already. Outside! I'm going to go outside, I can't... 'Cause I watch it and I'm just like, "Is that me? Do I say all that stupid shit on..." Like, you know what I'm talking about? For me, it's, like, white people are crazy all the time. - Well, that's true. - And it's... it's difficult. Actually, you know what? I'm not gonna lie, you know, 'cause we're out the cabin. You don't have to lie to me ever. I watched every episode of Girls. - I mean, you truly lost. - I definitely lost. I had to ride the fucking bus. - You rode the bus for a long time. - Yeah. - You crashed the bus. - Yeah. I crashed the bus. Yeah, I'm pretty bad at most things. Most things. What do you want to do now? Do you have a plan? I don't... - Do you have a plan? - No. Not really. I've been to New York once. - Ooh "the big apple." - Yeah. I was like, "I don't see it." I, like, got off the bus, I was, like, "Okay, everybody." - Just, like Like... "Calm down." - "Calm down." - This is funny. - No. - Three shots? - He's saying three shots, Melina. You know what? Are you guys ready for this? - No, I don't think so. - This is gonna be magic. You don't have to do this if you don't want to. Um, I have to do it. They're laid out in front of me, that means I have to do it. There's no... You're gonna have to puke outside. I'm not gonna puke. Oh, my God. Okay. - You'll have to puke outside. - Okay, ready? You guys ready? - I won't hold you hair. - Okay. - I won't do it. - I'll do it! - Thank you. - Again. - You know what? One. - Oh! Two. Okay. Three. Oh, no, no. - What was that? What the hell was that? - I don't know. What the hell was that? - Might've been the neighbors. - It sounded like someone was at the door. It's the universe telling me that I did a good job. 1, 2, 3. I don't know. I don't know you. I-I think... I don't know. I don't know. - I think I have to go. I have to, like, get out... - What is... No. It's fine... There's four of us. We're gonna go outside. We're gonna check and we're gonna see. Melina? - Come with me. We'll get weapons. - I'm there. Let's go. - It's gonna be good. - Who are you going to fight? - What weapons? - People! - We'll fight people. - Let's find a knife. - I'll fight a person. - That's a fun weapon. Maybe a shovel. I don't know. We'll figure it out. I have total faith... Okay. Okay. Look, we just gotta... We're finding weapons right now. We're doing the weapons. We're thinking, like, sharp. - We're thinking, like, pointy. - I got some. I got some more right here. What am I doing? What am I doing? What are we doing? So, like... Oh, okay. It's a classic, you know? It's, like, a Chanel. God knows he's expecting this baby! And so, it's like, why would I even suggest it? All right. Okay, I got another one for you. I got another one. I got... You know, you're so thoughtful, Melina. And I think that's what people, I think, don't realize sometimes, - because sometimes you're really selfish. - Right. - But... - Garrett! - We're gonna fuckin' kill somebody. - Kelly, we're ready! - We got it. - It's go time. Oh, God. This isn't a good idea. There's no way this is, like, actually a thing, right? It's probably just a coyote. - A coyote? - Oh, my God. I think that's, like, not as scary as monster. You might as well have said the Loch Ness monster's gonna come out of the frozen lake. A man-eating coyote. Hey, do coyotes attack people? Coyotes don't attack people. They set up traps. - They honestly... - Elaborate traps. - Oh, like this one... - That doesn't sound good. Listen. If we encounter a coyote, you don't need to get worried about having a knife or not having a knife. What? What would we have to be worried about? - You just gotta watch out for anvils. - Oh, my God. Shut up. Be quiet, we're hunting monsters... Guys! Jesus Christ. Ah, look, you got the pitchfork. I like it. It's a good look. I also was just out here and I was like, "Kinda nice." - It is nice. You're right. I'm feeling it. - I really like it. I enjoy it. - Look at the stars. Yeah. - Ooh. I'm feeling real good, like, maybe we just, like, take a walk or something. - Yeah, let's go for a night walk. - Night walk! - Yeah. - Night walk. Night walk. We were scared out of our minds... - Oh, Kelly. Come on... - What? Where you gonna go? What are you gonna do? What are you gonna do? - Just stay in this cottage by yourself? Ooh! - You can't stay here alone... Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine. Let's just go. Let's just, like, hurry though and go. - Yes! - Yeah! Uh-oh. Garrett's dancing again. Call the police. Going red. Purple. Red stripes. I'm ready. Let's go. Fuck, marry, kill. Kathy Bates, Academy Award winner Meryl Streep or... - First of all... - Or... Taylor T... Swift. - I do not believe in the institution of marriage. - Okay. Second of all, I think that the term fuck implies that women are objects to be used sexually, - which I do not agree with. And kill... - Okay. Okay, okay, okay, okay. Look, I get it. You're a good guy. Okay? There. Here's your fucking cookie. Wait! How many are there? This seemed more fun... What do you think that noise was? For real? - Kelly. - What? It was probably Bruce's dog. Yeah, or Bruce and Megan going on a nightly stroll. - Dad and daughter. - It's so late! Why would you... - I'm not. I can't sleep in that... Not after that. - You are. Yep. - You can't just undo that. - No. What the fuck? Oh, my God. - Jesus. - Whose man's is this? This is my grandfather's actual face. I found it in the closet back there. Fuck off. Oh, my God. I can't bel... Stop laughing. You scared me. - Oh, my God. You scared the shit out of me. - "Grandpa Watts." No. How long were you out there? I-I mean... What do you mean, "How long was I out there?" - How long were you out there, like... - That... that wasn't me. No. Fuck off. No, it was you. Stop. You're making it worse. - Are you okay? - No, I'm scared. I mean, I'm fine. It's just this bedroom's obviously haunted and then you just... - Whatever. It's okay. I have anxiety issues. - Well... Well... I mean, my room isn't haunted, so perhaps... Per chance, uh, the good lady, uh, would like to abscond with me to, uh, mine-a chamber? - "Mine-a"? - With me? This is so stupid. I don't understand the question. You, you... I'll just... - I can leave you with the face. - No. - And the face here, uh... - No. - I'll give you guys time. - I'll come with you. - Night, Garrett. - Goodnight, Garrett. Goodnight. - Goodnight, Kelly. - Goodnight, Kelly. Goodnight. - It's fine. - No. - No, it's fine. - No. I just know, like, I'm never gonna hear the end of this. Do you realize that? - That's... - Neither are you. Ever. That's fine. Um, how exactly did your, uh, grandfather die? Is it, like, a scary... - A scary situation? - No, it was an aneurysm. He died of an aneurysm. - I mean... - He, like, fell asleep... And then didn't wake up. I don't mean to laugh. I'm sorry. It's just, like, that, to me, is the scariest thing ever, I could ever think of. You fucking little whore. Megan? Megan? Megan? Megan! Megan! Thank you so much for cooking breakfast. I'm extremely hungover, so. That's very helpful. - I didn't drink as much as you. - That's true. So, I woke up early. Don't worry about it. Um, hey. It's me. Uh, I'm just, uh, calling you back. Uh, sorry I missed your call last night. We were just, you know, drinking a bunch. Um... Yeah, I was just calling to say hi, um... so, give me a call back whenever you get the chance. You know, if I don't answer, I'm out playing croquet for some reason. Fun stuff. I miss you, and, uh, I'll talk to you soon. Bye. So, you, uh, ready to go? Everyone's, uh, out there waiting. Do you think we should talk about... yesterday? Last night... specifically. It's fine. I mean, we're gonna play snow croquet. - It's fine. - You sure? - Yeah. I'm fine. - It seems weird. You're fine? - Are you sure? - Yeah, yeah. I'm fine. You're fine. - You're fine? - Yeah. It seems like this is something people talk about, you know what I mean? I mean, those guys are waiting for us outside. I don't know. - Okay. I mean, I... - I'll see you out there? - Yeah. Yeah, yeah. - We'll go play croquet. It's gonna be good. - I'll see you out there. - Yeah. No, Garrett. It's a stupid game. I hate it. I hate everything about it. I don't wanna play it, and I'll never play. We decided a name. It's "sno-quet". That sounds horrible. I hate it. We decided that name. It's gonna be great. Oh, what the fuck? Hey! Get the fuck out of here. What are you doing? I hate that fucking dog. - Calm down. - I hate that fucking dog. - Calm down, dude. - I thought he was kinda cute. Oh, okay. You know what? I think I can probably cross it. So, what you gotta do is break the barrel open, throw in a pellet... Line up the sights... and squeeze. Yeah, Garrett, I know how to shoot a gun. You think it's so easy? It is easy. Yeah, I know how to... Watch. Let me get the right one. Oh, my. Big boy. It's not as easy as it looks. I know how easy it is. Hello? - Hey. - Hey, Kelly. How's it going? I'm good. How are you? - What's up? - I'm just at work right now, so I might have to put down the phone. How's country life? No, it's... Yeah... it's really... It's fun. Yeah, we're having a good time. I mean, obviously, I wish you could be here too, - but... - You wanna take a crack at it? I wanna take a crack at it. Okay, instead of beer cans, we'll do the paint can. But paint can's so much bigger than the beer can. We'll go on the lake. Are you sure the lake's frozen? What, are you chicken? I'm not chicken. I just wanna make sure it's safe. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Fine, let's go. Give it to me. - Yeah, yeah. - Let's go. - Yeah. No, yeah, I'm having a lot of fun, it's just, like... in this weird head space. I've been having these, like, crazy dreams. It just really... You know, how... - They just, like, get to me and... - Mmm-hmm. This place is really weird. I mean, it's fun, but it's weird. I just don't do well... I gotta put down the phone for a second. - Yeah. Yeah. - Okay, just a sec. You getting along with Oscar the grouch? Um, yeah, I don't know. I've been having these crazy dreams since I've been here. - I don't know. Just... - Mmm-hmm. - There's this girl, next door... - No way. ...is really just, like, sad, and maybe her dad killed her mom or so... I don't know. I just, like... It's really just throwing me off and it's, like, not real. Obviou... Well, that's... I don't know. Whatever. Anyways, it's just, like, kind of fucking me up. - Like, out of it. - Kelly, - I'm sorry, I gotta put down the phone. - Yeah. - It's cool? - Yep. Hey, what you doing? What you doing? - All right, go get the paint can. - Okay. Hey. No, I know you're busy. Uh, can you just talk for, like, just 30 seconds and then put it down? - Just... - Babe, honestly, I am at work. - I'm sorry that I can't talk to you right now... - Got it! - I'm busy. - Throw it out. - Okay. - I'm sorry, I'm really busy. I kinda needed to talk to you - about something important... - Okay. Kelly, - I gotta put down the phone. Two seconds, okay? - Yeah. Fine. You missed it completely. You gonna throw me the paint brush, too? I said I had a good gunshot, not a good throw. Glenn, we need to have a fucking conversation, okay? It's very important. Can you just hear me out? Can you just stay on the phone for, like, two minutes? We really need to talk. Babe, I have to hang up the phone. Just for a minute. Just for 30 seconds. Garrett, stop. All right, I'm here. What's your problem? It's about Garrett. Garrett? What the fuck did he do? Garrett! Kelly! Kelly! Garrett! See? Told you guys the ice was safe. For fuck sakes. Open the door. Please, open the door. - You guys, we have to go. - What? I was... Wait, what... what happened? Garrett fell in the lake... - I feel more alive than ever. - "Than ever." What happened with you? I was walking through the woods. I was walking in the back path and then there was this car and so, I just walked towards it, and, like, it was someone's foot was hanging out of the car and then... - A foot? - And then that guy, like, - came in, like, yelled and ran at me. - What guy yelled at you? He came out of nowhere. He, like, lives over there... - Bruce? - Yeah. - Bruce Kingsley? - Yeah. No, exactly. There's so much shit back there. - An animal or something? - It could be a branch. Okay. Look, I've already thought - about all of these things. - Okay. So, I just need you guys to trust me. - You know what? - I wanna go. I feel weird about this, - and I just want to go. - Come here. Come. I'm sure you were on his property or something. - What do you mean? Why would he yell at me? - Okay. - I think we should go. - Here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna get dressed. I'll take us to Cici's, pay for the meal. If you still wanna leave after, we can go. - Yeah. Okay? - And then, it'll be good to de-stress... Get something in our stomachs. I'll get some wine for the table. It'll be fun. It'll be nice. If you still feel really uncomfortable, I swear we'll go. I'll drive home. - That's it, okay? - That sounds pretty fair. Look, I already told you guys I want to go home. If going to this stupid restaurant, like, means that I get to go home, then that's fine. But I want to go home, and I'm not gonna change my mind, okay? Okay, that's fine. Let's just focus on going to the restaurant. We'll get dressed. Go to the restaurant. - One hour at a time, you know? - It'll be fun. Like the drunks do. - I don't know. - It'll be fun. It'll be okay. It'll be good. What the fuck? Yeah. I said it was a foot. It was wearing a sock? - You didn't... - You all good here? Yeah. I would love some water, thank you. That's perfect, thank you! - Oops. - No, that's all right. You can put that down. I got it. Thanks. Uh, the food is great, by the way. Yeah, it was... It was really good. - All righty. - Oh. Wow. Uh, I thought townies were supposed to be nice. She probably had a long day. - I mean, cut her some slack. - Okay. I'm getting the vibe that all of you guys are feeling a little bit better. - Tatyana, you feeling better? - I'm drunk now, so, yeah, but I... I saw a foot today, Melina. - Oh, yeah. - I saw a lone foot. You think, like, - there's no proof that we saw the foot. - What do you mean? The proof is me. I saw the foot. That's the proof. - That's not the proof. - What more proof do you need? What do you mean? I witnessed it. Do we have any other witness? Any witness-i, to make this witnesses? I would like to witness you shutting the fuck up. Is what I would love... What would just like... Mmm. You got your pep back. I've got my pep back. Thank you for the wine. - It's all you. - No problem. It's the least I could do. Do you think that Bruce... It's Bruce's foot? Like, it's not... I saw Bruce. Bruce knows something's going on with the foot. Did he buy it? - I don't know. - You can't buy a... - Black market? - ...a foot. Hey! Hey, guys. - Hey! - How you doin'? Yeah, hi. - Nice to, um, meet you. - And what's your name? - Uh, Kelly. - Kelly, nice to meet you. - Hello. - Hi. Nice to meet you. What's your name, pal? Uh, Garnet. Oh, Garnet. That's a great name. Garnet. What a wonderful name. - His name is Garrett. - It's not Garnet. What's your name? Taty... Tatyana. - My name is Tatyana, hi. - That's so cool. Yeah, thank you. Your plans for tonight? What's happening? What's going on? I don't know. What are you doing tonight? Well, there's a party happening. - No. - A party? Yeah, there's this house party at James'. - Do you like parties, bud? - We do like parties. Do you like parties? - He loves parties. - Would you like to come? I mean, I want these other people to come. It's important to me these other people come, but I really want you to come. Kelly looks like she wants to go. Okay, let's do this. We have to... We... We gotta get out of here. - Yeah. We can get out... - To the party. Garnet, you're gonna love this party. - It's a night time thing... - My buddy has a truck. I've got a truck. He's got a truck. It's perfect. It's not okay. We have to go back. What do you think, uh... Do you want to come? - It's perfect. - Yep. Let's do this. You guys are gonna throw this democracy shit in my face. No, It's only fair. Come on. - It's the only way. - Who would like to go to the party? Me. Oh! So what do you guys, like, do? Mostly this. Mostly ride around in trucks. - Great. Well, it's pretty fun. - Yeah. No, like, what do you do for work? For work? That's a good question. Uh... - You gonna answer it, or... - Mysterious. You know, we fix things up. Sometimes we, uh... Do this and that. Right? - Right? - Yeah. I mean, we just hang out. Yeah, we hang out. You guys come out here often? Uh, no. This is just a little... Weekend trip. We're going back very soon. You guys are gonna love it. Honestly, it's pretty fun out here. We're staying, uh, beside Bruce Kingsley. - Do you know who he is? - Yeah. I know who Bruce Kingsley is. - And? - A few days back... He's a freaky dude, Bruce Kingsley. A few days back, I saw him in a convenience store. He walks in late at night, takes a carton of milk, pours it all over his chest... Pulls his shirt up, pours it over his chest. - Okay. - Drinks some of the milk, throws it on the ground, says, "That's the closest thing I've ever had to a mother." - What? - All right. That happened. What does that even mean? I don't know. Bruce Kingsley is like... He's a bit eccentric, Okay, I'll give him that. But he's not psychotic. You know? Are we almost here, or... We're getting there. But no, Bruce Kingsley is... Crazy. We're staying next to him. Should we be worried? I saw him yell at a tree once. - No. - Yeah. Just yelled at a tree. And nature's very important to me, so personally, I felt really hurt by that. Wait, so where are we going? Whose house? Oh. Oh. We're going to James's house. Honestly, this is gonna be a good time. Okay. Well, I guess I trust you. - You should. - Oh. Whoo! Party. Can I have some of that too? So this is how this night's gonna pan out, eh? Eh? That's not... That's not legal. You're gonna... It's totally fine. We do it all the time. - Come on. - When we're driving around in trucks. You guys are fucking idiots. This is what we do. This is all we do. Every day. We're living the life. Oh, my God. "That's the closest thing to a mother I've ever known." That happened. That's true. So this is the house? Yeah. Wait 'til you see inside. We're here. Yeah! All right! Hey, nice to meet you guys. Whose house? James' house! Say what! Everyone is kind of in their own "zone". Easy! I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. I'm kidding.

Uh, Montreal. From the city! Hey! Get a room, get a room, get a room, get a room, get a room, get a room, get a room. Montreal. Hell, yeah. I know Montreal. I was told there'd be beer. There's beer here. Fuck yeah, we got beer. This guy is looking for beers. Thirsty... What's your name? - Garrett. - "Thirsty Garrett." You know what I'm talking about? "Thirsty Garrett." This is not going well. - I don't know about this. - Yeah, you're not having fun? I just don't think I can do this "Garrett thing." - Okay. - I don't think I can do it. I think it's really stupid. I can't pursue it. It was just like a dumb... Okay. ...moment. And now I feel like a fucking idiot. It feels like you're going through little bit of crisis. And you know what you do when you're going through a crisis? You go and make out with those fucking hockey players that we met. Come on. Brad was kind of cute, and he was looking at you. He gave you the googly eyes, or whatever the fuck. Joe's a tall drink of water. I guess he's like, what... "Tall drink of water." Twelve. He looks like he's 12, right? No, 17 at least. Hey. Taty. Get everything done? What did you just call me? I'm sorry. Did you... You found the bathroom then, I guess. - Yeah. - Yeah? You got it all done. I'm sorry, it's a weird... I'm just... I'm just joking around. I'm trying to be fun. Tryin' to be casual. I need to, uh... Find someone. Okay. Okay. If you need anything though. Strikeout, okay? You gotta smoke a bong. You gotta chug a beer. You gotta do a shot. Once you've done those, you blow out the smoke. He can do it. He's a pro. He does this all the time. Wait, he doesn't blow out - until the end? - No, you gotta hold it in. Oh fuck! Hit it. What? Make out! We're going smashin', we're going smashin'. Let's go! Smashin'. - It is very hot. - Mmm-hmm. Yo, what's going on? - Oh, hi. - "New girl at the party". How are you doing? - "New girl at the party"? - Yeah, city girl. I like your look.

You wanna get out of here? - Using the fridge? - Yeah... - You're hitting on this girl. - I was not. I'm gonna get my brother to beat the shit... I guess. Garrett. Garrett. - Have you seen Tatyana? - Yeah, I've seen her. Why don't you get the fuck out of my face? You'll love this. Let me just find something. Give me a second here. Here take this flask for a moment. Go ahead. Let me find this for you. Just one second. Yes. Okay. Mmm-hmm. Also, is this gonna get me, like, really fucked up? Hey. Hey. Tatyana. You finding everything you're looking for? - Hey, Dave. - Whoa. Hey. Hey. It's been awhile. - Yeah, you know, it has. - I'm so sorry. Dave, he's probably been following you around all night, right? - Yes, actually. - That's kinda what he does, 'cause he's sort of a huge creep. Yeah, you fucking stalker. And as I light it, you're gonna want to pull this up very slowly. Let it fill up with smoke. It's gonna be fantastic. Oh, my God. This is crazy... Okay, you want to keep pulling up slow. Take that foil off and take a hit. - Oh, yes. - Oh, shit. Ah! Uh-huh. Can I show you something? Um, so what do you think of this party? I haven't seen you around, like, are you, uh... - I don't live here. - It's like, I saw a few people... - I haven't seen around. - I probably came with them. Okay, Um... Anyway, like, I have something to show you. - Okay. - I'll see you when you come back. I'll see you when you come back. I have something to show you. Okay. Okay, so this is the make out room. You can go... Enter at your own risk. - Okay. - So like the thing about Dave is that every fucking time I tell him that things... Do you play a sport? I played lacrosse. City champs, grade eight. That's adorable. And the main word that has been used to describe me is potential. And I heard it in elementary school. Mmm-hmm. - Like, grade six. Was like... I was kind of the... The kid, the person, you know. And things are, like, still good. But like, I kinda have to recapture that. - 'Cause it was like glory. - Yeah. Mmm-hmm. - You know. - And now you're just... - What do you... What? - Nothing. I'm, what, I'm nothing? No, I just meant... I just meant, like, now you're just trying to recapture. - Okay. - Trying to recapture is what you're talking about. That's fun that you and Dave are dating. No, we're not. ♪ You're in trouble ♪ Tomorrow you'll be fine ♪ When I'm at home ♪ Crying your name ♪ I know you won't ♪ Remember mine... ♪ Yeah! I don't like him at all. - Suddenly... - Suddenly... Dave has this other person. Dave doesn't... I don't think Dave... - And suddenly... I'm out of the picture. - Oh! - Do you... - So regular, and it's like something that... I'm not the person. And like I'm not the person that... The person wants to be with. And... And I'm not nothing. - I just remembered... - And everyone knows that. - But like... - We all have to go. We all have to go now. I have to go. No! No! Don't go! Kelly! Kelly, we're going. We... We're leaving. Okay. Let's go. Yeah? Mm-hmm. Okay, bye. Yeah, great... Great meeting you. Okay. Come on. Melina, we're leaving. Oh, okay. What happened? Yeah. Mmm. It doesn't matter. Let's go. I'm so... I'm so done with this place. I had fun. I had a good time. I think it's so cool. I just wanna thank you for, like, trusting me to drive you guys home. Not that you need to trust me, I mean, like, obviously, you know, there's no reason not to trust me to drive you guys home. I just mean, it's just really cool. That's all I'm saying. It's cool. Wait. Um... My friends are already out of the car - so I think I have to go. - You don't have to go in there. You know what, at least give me your number, or... You know, I'm actually only here for the weekend, so, uh, I'm not sure how well that would work out. Uh, thanks for the ride though. Appreciate it. Oh, fuck. You wanna talk about it? What is there to talk about, honestly? What just happened? You kissed that dude right in front of me. Are we actually doing this? Do you actually care? What do you mean do I actually care? The fuck kind of question is that? Since when is it your business who I kiss or who I do not kiss? Do you know what I mean? We kissed last night! And so what? Think about last time that happened, and like how much it did not matter to you. So they're just... Yeah, I think we should leave them alone. I think it's been, like, kind of a long time coming. This has been happening since high school. Not happening, but, like starting, not starting... That must have been fun for you being a third wheel for, like, 10 years? Ten years ago, you kissed me, - I was happy and I thought... - We were 17! You told me you were going to break up with your fucking girlfriend, like, then and there, you go inside, and then I'm here, standing here like a fucking idiot waiting for you, and nothing. And then the next day, I wake up and I'm embarrassed, I don't know what to do, and I look around at my friends... I was scared! - Can I tell you a secret? - Please. I fucking hate Glenn. I mean... Who likes Glenn? You know when people say that they're nice? Yeah. Like, go fuck yourself. Everyone's supposed to be nice. You know. Honestly, fuck you. Like, fuck this! Fuck this! Sorry. Fuck! Aw, God. I'm sorry, that's like really intense. But like... I don't know what to tell you. I don't know. I don't know what to do at all and... - Oh, my God. That's so good. - Yeah. Oh! Oh, shit. Okay, fuck, shh. - We gotta go. We gotta go. Ready? Ready? - Quiet, quiet, quiet. We're gonna get fucked. You know, I had fun today. Taty, don't you want more of this? Tatyana? Oh, my God. Kelly? Kelly? Kelly, she's... She's not in her room, I don't think. Oh, no. God. - Good morning. - Ooh, do I smell coffee? - You do. - Ah, you're a saint. - It's so nice. - I am, it is. Oh, good morning, Garrett. - Good to see you, Garrett. - Good morning. - How'd you sleep last night? - Er, good. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Did you sleep good? - Yeah. - Sleep alone? - Yeah. Good and alone? Drafty? Drafty there, was it cold? - Cold or was it warm? - Did you have to cuddle up? If you guys are asking if I... If Kelly and I slept in the same bed last night. - Yeah, that's exactly what we're asking. Thank you. - We did not. I did like a little search of the cottage, and she wasn't there. Did you look in her bedroom? - Yeah, that's part of it. - Yeah, she was... doing something with you. So you don't know where she is. This is not like a cute little fun game that you're playing? - She's probably... She probably just, like, passed out. - Yeah. Let's go. Let's go get her. You know what we should do? We should jump on her bed and give a chance to... Uh, she's not in her room. - Uh, maybe... - Maybe check the washroom. Um... She's probably here, she's... - I mean... - Well, she's not here. I mean, I was up pretty early. Like I feel like... She's like, trying to play some, like, weird prank on us. Kelly, this isn't funny. Like the bag that she brought isn't here. Did she leave it in the car? - Garrett, do you remember seeing it in the car? - Luggage in the car? - Okay. - Fuck the van is at Cici's. Ah, fuck. We left the car at Cici's. Jesus. You know what, I'll call... I'll call her cell phone. I'm just trying... - It's fine. - ...because we came back with those guys... - And then we left. - Her phone's just ringing. That's weird. 'Cause like... - Probably the battery is probably dead. - No, it's like ringing, right? Like, was she upset? Like, or like... - Like did you be... - I mean, we talked a bit. And I kissed her goodnight. She went to bed after... Like a peck or like a kiss? - Maybe call Glenn... - You know what? ...maybe she got upset. - Maybe just call Glenn. - All right, I'll call Glenn. Good, that'll do. - Well, you know what, we can't find her, so... - Okay. Hey, Glenn. Yeah, it's Melina. How are you? - How are you? - We're good. Um, I was just wondering if you, if you heard from Kelly. - No. Is she all right? - Everything's fine. - You sure? - Yeah, don't worry about it. Can you just try calling her again? I'm calling her again. Because, like, now I'm getting a little bit stressed out - that she's not here. - Yeah. Call her again. Okay, this is getting a little bit, uh... - Not fun, okay? - Maybe her phone died. It wouldn't work if it just died, right? It'd just go straight to voicemail. But it's ringing, right? So that means that she's not. Maybe she left it at Cici's or the party. Will you guys shut up? Shut up. Okay. - Her whole bag is here. - Oh, my God. Her phone is vibrating in the bag. - In the bag? - Yes. - Her wallet's here. - She's gone for a walk or something. That's not making sense. Kelly would never go for a walk by herself. Why'd she go for a walk without her phone? - We need to find her. - Okay. I'm gonna call us a cab... - Why would you call a cab? - We have to go get the van at Cici's. Where're we gonna call a cab in cottage country? What the hell are you talking about? I'm gonna call a cab. There's one in town. - What we're gonna do then? - We're gonna go get the van, if you wanna look for her. If you're so convinced that she's gone missing. We're gonna go find her. Okay? We're gonna go find her. No, I'm calling a cab. Garrett, you call a cab if that's what you need to do, we're gonna go outside and we're gonna find Kelly. Okay? - Fine. I'm calling a fucking cab. - Call the cab. Kelly, come on. Let's try this way. Kelly? I don't wanna wake up the neighbors and do something stupid, you know? I know. I just feel like... I feel like I want to go back and check. Melina? - Okay. Okay. - I wanna go back and check. Okay. You go back. I'm gonna check over here. Kelly! Tatyana, get over here! Kelly! What happened? You have to look after yourself. There's so much blood. Okay, okay. We're gonna get you up. You have to walk. You have to walk. Oh, my God. Help her up! Grab her by her arm. Ready? - Fucking Christ! - Hold it, Garrett. It's gonna be okay. Kelly. Get help. I don't where my phone is. Oh, my God. Call 911. Are you okay? Kelly, you just need to... I'm just gonna look at it. It's not that bad. Okay, baby? Baby, it's okay. Okay. You and me, we'll get through this, okay? You with me? Right? Roommates. Right? It's gonna be okay. Kelly, it's okay. Look. Look at me. Hear me. Hear me. Hear me. Okay. Hear my voice. Help is on the way. Garrett called 911. You'll be fine. Work with me, okay? It's okay. They're gonna come. It's gonna be fine. Okay. It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be okay. Listen to my voice, okay? Listen to my voice. I'm here. I'm not going anywhere. Kelly is... I don't know what's gonna happen with Kelly. I really hope she's gonna be okay. If the ambulance doesn't come now. I don't know... I don't know what's gonna happen. She lost so much blood. Why the fuck are you making tea? It'll calm everyone down. Garrett, I don't think you understand. Kelly is... What the fuck are you doing? - Wha... - I... What? - What happened? - Kelly's not okay. - Melina. I heard the door slam. - Just... Garrett just left. Why did he leave? - He tried to kiss me. - What? - I don't know what's happening? Yeah. - He tried to kiss you. - Where is he now? - I don't know. He's outside somewhere, I don't fucking know. - Let's get the ambulance. Let's get the ambulance. - What? If the ambulance just doesn't come soon, - Kelly's just gonna die. - No, Melina. We just have to wait. They're coming. - Where is... he's just outside? - Just went outside. You gotta get up. - I don't know. I can't. - We gotta just get up. Get down. Keep it down. He fucking did it. He's the one who attacked, okay? We have to be very quiet, okay? We have to be quiet, okay? - Okay. - If he sees us... No, no, no, we have to find Garrett. We have to tell him. - No. - No, we have to tell him, he's gonna kill him. Melina. Don't go outside. Melina. Garrett? Garrett? - She was so beautiful. - I know. I loved her. - I loved her. - I know. We have to go... We have to go get... What the fuck are you doing? Garrett. Just stop it. I don't know what... Hey! Hey! Hey, hey! Come on. No! - What you doing here? Whoa! - You have to help me. What's the fuck happened to you? - This girl is fucking killing everybody. - No way. no way. - She bit my fucking hand! - Okay. How can I help? - How can I help? - Give me that hammer. - No. You want my knife? - Give me that hammer. - Fuck, Give me that fucking hammer! - Whatever. What else can we do? What do you wanna do? We gotta do something.
