"To make a prairie it takes a clover and one bee" - Emily Dickinson I love cherry blossoms But for some reason, I feel relieved when they've fallen Just joking... Takemoto's strange, isn't he? Like his shorts? He's like, too healthy He's not unhealthy enough Hardly the art school type He's got zero fashion sense This enough chives? Sure, but that also makes him appealing Not as a boyfriend Bet he's nice to girlfriends Bet he's single Maybe a good husband - No girlfriend - Nope Don't put milk in there! Sorry I dreamed about a "Kazamachi Dori" rice omelet last night - From Morita Morita san? Yeah, he's getting back soon What's his deal, anyway? To me, he's just an annoying 8th year student Excuse me No, you're good I'll start the grill! It's time for the Hanamoto Lab Junior Group Retreat, meaning, a gathering of Dr. Hanamoto's fans, to begin! Does everybody have enough beer? Sorry, we need more here Beer?

Your painting's good, really good Almost as good as me Um, Morita san What's your name? I'm Takemoto, your dorm neighbor Morita san, when did you get back? What? I thought you already graduated, Morita san What! I thought you'd died, Morita san... I heard you disappeared on Mt. Chomolungma I never heard you praise anyone's work before That's not true Yes it is, that was a first Yeah? I think Picasso and Basquiat aren't half bad I have this sick feeling you're serious Of course I'm serious I believe in recognizing talent All right, ready? It can be a smell or a voice Not just your friend's face, sitting next to you Close your eyes, move closer and make a picture of what you feel OK? Hagumi! How do you write your name? Like it sounds Thanks for this What's your name, again? I'm Takemoto, I live next door Listen... Takemoto... Wow, it's like, it's like bursting with energy And is this right side up? You're so easy to talk to No one's ever said that Really? Want one? Kids are so cool If they want to, they can draw smells and voices We'll never be able to recapture such invisible... Hey... Maybe some rare people can Just joking... Everybody! Draw crazier paintings, crazier than hers! Takemoto He really is amazing I'm not amazing What's amazing is the world Flesh, blood, bone, earth and insects, they're all the real thing You know? You do? When I don't know what I'm talking about Oh, I know A souvenir Just a leftover It's so sweet That's the crap that sells, all over the world Such an impure heart making something so sweet But I made it, so in 10 years it'll be worth a lot Use it to send your kids to private school Ten years from now... I wonder what I'll be doing? If he's going to paint all his life... What's this? Doraemon's voice-over actress changed? What are you talking about? That actress changed before you left Oh, yeah? It's Morita san Hey, Mayama! Hey, what's this? Aren't you going to ask, "You were alive? Where were you?" Be more interested in me No souvenirs for you! It's against the law to stalk people, you know That's not what this is You may want her, but love means she has to want you back That's not what this is I told a female cop she was cute and got charged with sexual harassment, get it? I do Why's that all you get!? Sorry How old is that lady? A lot older than you Have a normal, fun love-life Oh, no, no, no If I keep this up, I really will get arrested "Rika san's lip cream" "Rika san's favorite perfume" "Notepaper Rika san used" "A straw Rika san used" Thank you! All you bumpkins! Thank you, thank you I'm grateful to be welcomed home from my long travels with such a modest party I really am grateful, but... Who are you? Good morning Good morning Um, the thing is... If you don't have anyone to eat lunch with, that is, if Dr. Hanamoto can't make it to lunch, would you consider having lunch with me? Really? See you at lunch in the cafeteria I'll save us seats See you! Um... What, what, what? You don't want to? Thank you Thank you See the bulletin board? It says, "Mayama, a senior in Architecture City Design "is late submitting his senior thesis" Exactly, I just can't decide Having to condense 4 years of education... Why not postpone graduating a year? Hey, that's great Postpone it a year Wow, I'm hungry Want to get a bite to eat? What? Eat something? Yeah You and me? Well, yeah, sure It's a bit of a walk but how about Mediterranean? It's 11AM, they're probably open for lunch Or someplace closer by... Oh, sorry Hello, yes Right now? Sure, within the hour I'll be right there Sorry, gotta work I need more work if I'm staying behind a year That's not good More work is not good After finishing working at the Harada Design Office, I begin my surveillance at 1 PM at the park Fifteen minutes later, I start tailing And I follow Mayama What a coincidence, totally Mayama Yamada? Mayama? Rika san? What a coincidence Let me introduce you two This is Harada Rika, from the design office where I work This is Yamada, a year behind me in art school From Hanamoto's Lab? No, Yamada san's in ceramics, so not the Lab Um, she's just... an acquaintance from the Hanamoto group Acquaintance? Lately, we all get together and drink at Dr. Hanamoto's, once in a while That's where... And Rika, I mean, Harada san... Rika? Studied architecture with Hanamoto san He introduces me to gifted students who work part-time for me I'm not gifted, not at all Mayama's in love I hardly feel I'm worth paying... You're definitely worth it I knew it I'm headed this way I want to check out a store that way Later See you I'd heard about you... You're Hanamoto Hagumi? Why don't you submit your work for a prize? But there's one condition... I'll go buy meal tickets What do you want, Hagu? The Stamina Lunch There's the girl genius Her? Up close, she's pretty cute Scholarship student Not your average student Explains her slightly suspicious look The girl genius is upholding our school's reputation Lots of pressure She's special She's an "artist" It's so crowded and noisy, let's go somewhere else I know, have you been to "Kazemachi Dori"? Their rice omelet's perfect Just their rice omelet I see, you're from Nagano Nagano brings to mind... The MATSUMOTO castle The castle keep is a national treasure It's a five-tiered keep so it's really imposing Do you know a five-tiered keep? Do you even know a castle keep? Wait, do you even know MATSUMOTO castle? That's not right, Hagu Born in Nagano and you've never seen MATSUMOTO castle? Castles are great, old buildings are great, they're what men dream about Did you know? In that giant structure, there are no nails... Ayu... What? You know Yamada san from Ceramics? We're friends Bye, I have to go to work If it's all right, maybe we could have lunch again Meow-zaburo! I'm here at your call Red scarf, waving in the wind Meow-zaburo's here to rescue a shopping arcade in need of help Meow-zaburo is really into it today Something good happen? Something bad happen? Want to hear? No thanks, I'll pass Right What if you find my story disgusting Pisses me off It doesn't suit you to look so happy Looking miserable suits you, Yamada san You got me back good Harada, it's been 5 years since you vanished, Leaving a huge hole in Rika's heart But I can't fill that hole Not me... Oops What, you're back? Y es. You were out before so I'm back to offer a greeting Don't sound so formal, I'm not even your instructor Really? I teach architecture What's my major, then? I know it's not architecture You're right What brought you back home? Thought I'd have a solo show, to kill some time There's a gallery that's been after me Fujiwara Gallery, right? They told me themselves And after that? Nothing Still no plans to graduate? I'm so in love with the school and you... A solo show at that gallery to kill time and no plans to finish... Just about your speed Why don't you get serious, for once Are they... That important? Those fag brothers are? Oops, I don't have time for this I've got to go, Morita Mind if I stick around? Feel free I know A souvenir, sort of What is this? It's cute Oh, you're home I'll fix dinner, now We're having pasta tonight Today, Dr. Koda said I should apply to the Oslo International something or other The Biennale Did she? Sounds good, why don't you? But not my usual paintings Right, I guess she means no abstracts I've heard that They're bad? Abstracts aren't hot now They're not bad You should paint the pictures you want, however you like It doesn't matter if you win a prize or not If you like it, you keep it Thank you There she goes Amazing Sorry to call you here You're going to Morita's show? Yes, I'd like to go to the opening Is this already finished? No, probably not She hasn't signed it yet If you're going, could you take Hagu with you? What? Aren't you going? I'm going but I've got to stop off somewhere first Sure, I'm happy to... As long as Hagu doesn't mind Yamada said she's attending the opening, so take her, too Sure, sure, fine Might as well invite Mayama and have him drive What do you say we pick her up at home about Y PM? First, I have to see how Hagu feels about all this So, where's Hagu today? Oh, well, she's taking an awful long break I like that painting of yours Your sculpture was better a week ago Busted, huh? Yep, I screwed it up I have to start over Once you carve, you can't fix it Wood sculpture's tough I can understand why it's not cool But it looks fun It is The world I could never see, no matter how I strained, unrealized dreams and longings I wonder how the world looks, seen through their eyes Hmm, it's lovely I think it's really lovely It's big It's hard It's curved It's fine isn't it, Luigi? It's more than fine, Mario Do you get it, Morita? This isn't about having fun Right, this is business Right, unfortunately, before it's art... Yeah, unfortunately, it's a product first Finish it You're stubborn Just have a normal, fun, youthful love affair I bet girls like you If you just go for it Hey, Takemoto We're having a barbecue upstairs, join us No, I'll pass No, hey Did something bad happen? Did something good happen? Come eat Honestly, it's beef, real beef Real beef It's good Tastes awful But it's good About this meat, you know the shopping arcade where I work The young boss at Suzuki Butcher's, even though the young boss is over 40, he'd been set up on a date, and he was all for it and wanted to date her, but... What's that paint smell? I knew it was meat It's not right, Morita san The delicate aroma of this meat... Mr. Cow? Want some? Sure I will, but... Meat, I like meat Meat, I just love meat I'd had a bad feeling all day, that day Sorry Why are you chasing me? Because you ran away I'm running because you're chasing Really? So, what do you want? Um... You know So, what is it? Um, Yamada Why me? What are you talking about? I doubt I'll change Um, it'll be much easier if you find another guy I think you'd better stop looking at me Was I dumped? I hurt Yamada After which... Um... In other words, I'm fired? To put it bluntly Because I love you? Forgive me if I've misunderstood No... You're not wrong This office is too small for that sort of thing I understand I think you're absolutely correct Thank you for understanding Um, is that the only reason? Yes Your work was better than any of my other workers I'm relieved to hear that I'll think up a new approach and come back Good bye After which, I got dumped Getting dumped, the feelings only grew stronger I'm talking about Yamada, here Hey, Hagu, that's... It's cute Why did you start working on such a large scale? Honey, that's a wonderful question Do you mind if I answer? Compared to the size of his talent, this is nothing at all This isn't even relevant He's heading off into the world This is what it means to live by your art Morita san's like a celebrity He feels so far away... Is that a tuxedo? I've never seen someone wearing a tuxedo And he even looks good in it Hole-Ridden Tree - Sold This is... I decided not to start over This show needed a giant piece of art to anchor it I didn't have time to start over The price is so high We make the art, and the gallery puts a price on it That's how this world works So I've done nothing wrong Nothing wrong You don't agree, do you? I'll take a look around Rika san! Rika! Oh, Hanamoto, darling You've made my day Thank you It's been way too long, way too meaningful, we're way too happy Mayama Oh, Rika san Mayama, these are the Fujiwara brothers They own the gallery They were art school classmates with Hanamoto and me Despite their looks, they've got great taste Is this show Morita's? He's been discovered by some real operators You're so mean! Hana darling, you finally caught Rika How many times do I have to tell you, it's never been like that How can you say that, Hana darling It's about time you forgot about Harada, Rika Hanamoto and I aren't involved No, no Yes, he did, he hit me! Everything OK? What? That's that art critic... We used to be like that, too Don't you remember? I forgot What happened! That man... That pretentious guy? That's Nagata Kei, the art critic He called the sculpture... Did he bad mouth it? He said, "It's only big" That's why you hit him? Yeah, for that she jumped him What? Hagu did... Yeah, and I was trying to stop her... This is the legendary car I've only heard stories about! Nostalgic It took me a year of fixing it up to get it into driving shape Amazing! Hey Let's go to the beach The beach? The beach Now? Yeah, now Yes! I want to go to the beach Yes! Let's go, c'mon, Hagu Yeah I want to go All right, let's go For real? Yes, c'mon, get in No, no, please don't drive, Morita san I'll drive, you don't have to drive Get in Morita san! Morita san! Hey, hey, Morita san, easy on the gas pedal there Great, great, I love this worn-out engine, I can't stand it! Fantastic! Ease up on the gas? Worn-out? I think it may smell smoky Hey, Hagu, you're from Nagano? I always wanted to ask someone from Nagano Is it true that 40 percent of people from Nagano haven't seen the ocean? Forty percent sounds too high... Right, Takemoto? Don't ask me The ocean! Ocean! I'll scream, Takemoto Sounds good, Morita san You're on I'm the best! Youth is best! When you say the word youth, it's so totally earnest Perfect A photo of youth to look back on in old age The height of youthful folly What do we do? Shit, it's your fault for not really fixing it, Mayama You're the one that raced it too hard What, it's my fault? What are you kicking? Morita san Oh, thank god you're with them, Yamada Please look after Hagu You're my only hope, Yamada Leave it to me... she'll be fine You sound too scary, Dr. Hanamoto Mayama's boasting it'll be an easy fix in the morning OK, then Good night Pisses me off! Yamada, got 100 yen? I think you should stop, Morita san You've already spent 2,000 yen If you don't learn how to lose now, your life will be a series of tragedies Oh my, you're awfully insightful, aren't you? I was the only fool in love... Did you already tell Hagu how you feel? You get right to the point, don't you? Of course not, huh? Of course not, not yet Better get it together or you'll regret it the rest of your life I mean both of us The rest of my life... Sounds unbearable The person I love chooses to love me above all others That's all it takes, but I don't think it'll ever happen You kids think too much Giving up... How do you do that? Just don't give up That was a really good line I can really do that? Refuse to give up? You're really in love... Yamada, you get me, like nobody else I get you like nobody else does In other words, we're the best team for getting each other Like peaches and cream Like sugar and spice, no, like two peas in a pod I get it, I get it The best in the world! The best team in the world! The best team in the universe! Hagu, since you came to our school... April, May, June, July, August, September It's been six months So fast It's been so fast Time flies like an arrow Or time is money, Life is short... So, um... What I want to say... I'll say it I... feel about you... What is this shit! Because... mine's better Since I was a kid, I always wondered... Why do people draw pictures? Because we want to Because we have to draw That's... Like asking people why they live Quite an answer Straight as an arrow, no doubt I genuinely envy you I think, from the first time I saw your painting... Hear, hear You thought yesterday was rock bottom... Wrong! Say whatever you want You can't wait to lose Winning or losing, that's not for me So you don't even step into the ring, just toss in the towel It sure is safer You're up against a tough rival I have to agree How's Hagu doing? Haven't seen her recently I see The thing is, Hagu stopped painting Put simply, she's in a slump... Something happen at the beach? Gee, I don't know Anything between Hagu and Morita? Why do you suspect Hagu and Morita? If anybody's going to get to Hagu, it's Morita, is what I think Not me, huh? I'd be happy if it was you Sorry, joking Don't look at me like that, your misery's contagious Drop in on her once in a while, OK? Hagu, did you eat lunch? You OK? I can't... seem to manage "like always" You're not well Listen, Hagu If there's anything I can do... I'm happy to... Hey, part-timer! Yes Come here Render this as a drawing I want it done today, too Yes Takemoto! Life is so hard Getting right to the heavy stuff How's things? I'm on a losing streak I want to be happy I want to be happy, too Maybe it's time to look for a four-leaf clover I'd look for it, if it really exists Don't tell me you've never found a four-leaf clover What? I thought they were fairy tales Like dragons and mermaids and Bigfoot You've led a life so unlucky it's almost genius Don't say that so intently All right Everyone! We're all looking for four-leaf clovers For this miserable young man! Can't find any Can't find any but it's still fun It's fun to move around Honestly, I'm not having much fun I guess sulking doesn't suit me Say Is my spine crooked? Hard to tell Sold Rice omelet? No, no, not so fast Hey! Hey, Morita Oh, Yamada Hey What are you doing here? Coincidence? It won't shut Oh, look at the time Sorry, see you No, this way Mayama Let's go I never run into you, even in the dorm I'm busy, in my own way Who knows where Mayama is He's around Only, you never see him I haven't seen Yamada since the beach Yamada's doing her best You just don't know about it Huh, so everybody's doing their best without me Sounds a little... What about her? Who? Don't tell me you haven't seen Hagu, either? Guess I haven't In a word, Hagu's in a slump A slump? Some kind of psychological shock Don't tell me... You know perfectly well How much of a slump? Worried? Well, you know... I'm worried I'll start out like an intern I'm barging in And if I'm useful, please let me work here Why? Please let me work here for you It'll end the same way I'll just... I don't care if you hurt me I won't get hurt You didn't give up, Mayama See you I told you to avoid abstracts this time, didn't I? Why don't you take my advice? If you just listen to me, the Oslo International's within your reach But if you do what you always do, you'll never be competitive I know Dr. Hanamoto is well aware of that I've seen so many talented artists disappear through recklessness and willfulness Our job as instructors should be to minimize such tragedies At this rate, she'll be crushed, by the weight of her own talent At this rate, that's definitely what will happen Actually, I think you already know that Right, Hanamoto san? Don't chase her, Morita! Don't mess with her heart on a whim Please You're absolutely right about the role of instructors, but once in a while let them dream for all of us So irresponsible Hagu! Sorry That Hagu, not eating... Sorry You don't need to apologize I guess Dr. Koda's prediction came true I was hoping she could push through on sheer talent She's got to crawl out of this on her own But... All we can do is watch and wait And I... Was taken aback by how very little, I could actually do for her Meet Morita Shinobu Today's the opening of his solo show... How's this flyer for our next Hanamoto party? Hey, look, that's Morita Morita san, Morita san! What on earth is this? Wait a minute! Five million yen! Does this price include taxes? Taxes? You tell her No, it's tax-exclusive Tax-exclusive... Do you have a girlfriend? That question's so TV Shall we recruit one? I wonder what's going to happen to us... Oh! A commercial! You shouldn't be on TV now, Morita What I can do for her... So, that was our "Hunk Hunter" section By the way, this exhibition is open all week Thanks, OK I'm sorry What's with that guy? Hey, Takemoto What are you doing, Morita? I was just being hunted by a hunter Hey, but what are you doing here? Do you know how bad Hagu is? Yeah Then why don't you do something? Instead of going on TV The person who can help Hagu now isn't Dr. Hanamoto and it isn't me, it's you... I think There's nothing I can do, either There has to be something, if you think about it I just can't think of anything, but I know you can Please look out for Hagu Not that I'm in a position to ask you... That was all I could do for her, then Not so bad for being young And then I ran away, turning my back on my entire past, as though tumbling down Yamada! Tomorrow's party... What? Wow That's a kashira rail, right? Dates from the 15th century? You know your stuff Want to try? I can? Of course not You're a pest, go away Sorry Before I realized, I was racing, intent only on pedaling And... I was remembering, Morita san's irritating loud laugh, Yamada san's face, trying not to cry Mayama san's surprisingly sweet voice Your smile I'll scream, Takemoto Sounds good, Morita san You're on I'm the best! Youth is best! When you say the word youth, it's so totally earnest Where had the sparkling sea gone? I can't run away If I run now, it erases everything, even meeting you Hello What's with the vibe in here? Amidst a certain sadness, let's start the Hanamoto party Does everyone have something to drink? A toast to Dr. Hanamoto's scraggly beard Cheers No, no, that's not what I meant So, which did you take first... You seem a little strange today I'm not strange You're not strange... Morita san Mayama I'm borrowing your car You don't mind, the car? I don't mind How about you? Mind your own business, and do something about that giant pickle Watching you... was like watching myself It was painful But eventually, being uncool, or being stubborn didn't matter anymore What are you doing? I'm sorry, Yamada I still can't give up on her Hey, you drooled Mayama I like you Mayama I really like you Yeah I love you Yeah Thanks So this is how it feels to burn your own work How? Like burning stacks of cash Don't worry, it's only money burning here Stacks of cash But not my work At some point, it stopped being my art Can I say something more embarrassing? You're not alone You've got Hanamoto san, you've got me, you've got Yamada and Mayama Takemoto's worried sick about you So don't go off on your own The reason I'm talking like a teenager... It's his fault It's Takemoto's fault Mr. Youth told me to think it over That I should be able to help you Your ass is bleeding Just joking Want a ride? There's room for your bike I'm fine Right I get it You're searching for yourself No, I'm not You don't have to hide it I'm not hiding it It's great to be young Take this Take this and go find yourself Sawada Construction Tel: 075-717-12XX Thank you! It never occurs to me to help someone, seriously So, I couldn't figure it out, and here I am Am I helping you? You are Y es, you are Thanks for... Save your thanks for Mr. Youth I'm leaving the country That's what I thought you'd do Someday I want to support you I want to have the strength to support you But for now, I'll do what I can Right now, I'll tell you what I need to Hagu I... Love you, Hagu Thank you How's your work, Takemoto? Is it too hard? Morita san had his first solo show in New York The reviews were not great They just make him more passionate Mayama was officially hired at Harada Design In love and in work, he's hustling Hustling? Frankly, he can do whatever he wants Me... I'm laying low for now Oh, right Hagu finished a new painting with that brush you repaired for her It's cobalt blue, a shimmering, beautiful, painting of the sea...
