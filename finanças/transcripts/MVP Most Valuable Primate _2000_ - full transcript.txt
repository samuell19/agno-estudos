Jack, how is anybody gonna believe that you're a genius? When you behave like this? Don't forget! 3pm Saturday. Everyone's invited! EL SIMIAN NATURE PRESERVE Yes, Judy. They didn't renew my funds this year. Is there room for Jack? |Of Course. We miss Jack. | It's been kinda quiet without him. Nancy would love to see her baby agan. I'll make all the arrangements| and I'll call you tomorrow. Hey, sweetie. How| was your day today? Did you make any new |friends today? Oh honey, I'm so sorry. So what happened today?

But once they get to know who you are,| it won't matter. Kisses. Come on Jack, lets go! You're a funny guy, Jack. What, Jack?| I don't see anything. Did you steal one of my marshmallows? Alright, then. Sorry, buddy. It's time for bed, okay? Let's go to bed. "And the Zookeeper said:| Good Night, Elephant. And the Zookeeper said:| Good Night, Lion. And the Zookeeper said:| Good Night, Gorilla." Good Night, Jack. What have I gotten myself into?| - Junior B Hockey, son. End of the road for most of these guys. They're been cut from every Junior A team around. I'm their coach. Coach Marlow. | - Oh sorry Coach. Nice to meet you. I'm Steven Westover. Ya, well, over on the bench there.| That's Captain Pete. He was our allstar scorer last year. | But he's on the Injured List now for some reason. Sitting next to him there is Scott. He's the one knitting. Sorry, knitting? I wouldn't make a big deal out of it, if I were you. Last year he made us all real nice stockings to hang on the mantle at Christmas. Over there too, that's the big guy. His name's Moose. And the guy that he's throttling, the guy turning purple, that's Larry. And in the goal over here, that's our keep Magoo. He was the Top Rookie Choice for the WHL, Believe it or not. Then his nerves got the better of him. He's not as good anymore. Let me introduce you to the rest of these kuckleheads. Nighty Night Magoo! Smelling Salts! We're all out. All right everyone. This is Steve. He's the Yankee kid who's trying out for the team today, eh? Steve is the, was the, leading scorer on the California High School Hockey League Campionship Team. Do they even have ice in California? [LAUGHING] Now let's pratice! I wanna see a little hustle! Let's Go! Scott! Up the wing! Okay, I'm gonna get him. Awww, hell. Alright, California! Let's get him. Welcome to Junior B Hockey. -No Time to Celebrate. You like that Palm Tree boy? Smelling Salts? Out of smelling salts. If I could have your attention? I have some very... sad news to report to you. Last night, Dr. Kendall had a heart attack. He's no longer with us. Good Evening hockey fans! This is Willy Drucker. The voice of the Nelson Golden Nuggets. Bringing you tonight's highly anticipated SEAAAAASON OOOOOPENER. One win this season. That's all I ask. Just one win. [ORGAN PLAYS] Here come the Nuggets. Powering onto the ice. -YOU GUYS SUCK! And there's a new addition to this year's squad, Steven Westover from California. Moose! Slide! Oh! He misses it by a country kilometer. Westover! Get out there! And the Yankee gets his first shift, lets see what he can do. Pass the puck. I'm open! Westover is wide open! And he refuses to pass the puck! The Vikings turn around, wide open! He shoots... He scores! Oh 4-0, Ohhh! Coach Marlow certainly has his work cut out for him, if he wants to turn things around. Let's hope we see better hockey coming up for the rest of the season, folks. Man, we sucked tonight! [Laughs] Quiet man, if you could stick handle. [DOORS CLOSING] Who's that? I've decided to discontinue the research. And sell the chimp to another facility. It had been my understanding that Dr. Kendall was planning to send the chimpanzee back to El Simion Nature Preserve. I realize. However, as Dean of scientific research for this entire university... it's my duty to make sure this department stays on budget. Jack has been sold to the University of Tennessee Research Hospel Isn't that where they're doing Hepititis testing? I'm not sure. It's only a rumour. None of this information should leave this group. Hepititis, Hepititis. Not good, Jack. People can die from that Jack. What, Jack? Yes, this is very nice, Jack. But... Home? You want to go home! Okay! Ya, lots of underwear's a good idea, Jack. Good idea, Jack. Yes, I'd like one ticket to El Simion, please. [WHISPERS] Hang on Jack, We're almost at the station. You're doing a really good job. And I'm really really proud of you. Okay, that's the third stop before San Fransisco. Don't miss it. Take Gate 3. Thank you, sir. This is the last boarding call to Los Angeles, San Fransico, Seattle, Vancouver and Nelson, Canada on Platform 10. You okay, Jack? So, when you get there, give this to the Taxi Driver and he'll let you off at the Preserve? Okay? Then you can see your Mama again, Jack. And don't forget to listen for El Simion. Okay? Tickets, please! Tickets! Ticket, please. Just a second, folks. We're going through a tunnel. Thank you very much. Ticket please. That's gotta be a penalty, folks. But don't expect one. This ref's a hometowner. Aww, come on ref! Moose is dragged off the ice with only 30 seconds left on the clock. It's Tigers 3, Nuggets 2. It's getting uglier by the minute, ladies and gentlemen. These Tigers aren't Tigers at all, they're Gorillas. Hey Ref! Hey, that's a penalty right? That was a clean hit. You've gotta be kidding me! Get over it! Ok, they're the home team. He's not calling nothing on em. Look this ain't High School hockey, okay? Yeah, you're right about that. He's gonna head hunch you on the Faceoff. Thanks. Egg 'Em! Aww, you okay Yankee boy? #4 You're outta here! I got tired of being kicked around, alright? I'm sorry. Tara, no one's gonna scout worst Junior B hockey team in the history of the planet. Alright? It's just not gonna happen. Yeah, you're right. Have faith. Let's Go. El Simion! El Simion stop! End of the line, folks. Everybody off! We're in Nelson, BC. How many kids do you know that can speak 2 languages and lip read, huh? Because I know one girl who can, alright? Give me a hug. [Screams] Did you see a monkey in the woods? Tara, this is Canada. There's no monkeys in the woods. Maybe it was a beaver, or something? We're gonna be late for school. We gotta go. You're saying the Chimp never arrived! Where's the monkey? Jack? Ohh... He's gone? Who stole that chimp? I don't know! I'll find that Chimp, if it's the last thing I do! [Snickers] [Screams] [Jeering] What's up with you guys? I mean, all you do is goof around. We get our butts kicked every game. -So? -Do you like losing or something? That's easy for you to say, man... we don't have plans to turn the country on a hockey scholarship. -Yeah, Wonderboy. My next job is gonna be in Moosejaw pumping gas at my Uncle's station. -Yeah, and I'll be on the farm in Speedy Creek, tossing hay. That's what happens when you get passed up by the scouts. At least, you can go out there with a little bit of pride, not look like a bunch of losers. That's all I'm saying. -Hey! Guys, I think the kid's got a point. -Come on... Whatever. Hey! Have you seen my math book? No. You haven't seen any monkeys again, have you? No, how was practice? Practice was fine. Listen, tell me if you see anything, alright? Hey. Jack. The monkey you saw in the woods. I wanted to surprise everybody. Tara, it's not a good idea. I mean, mom's not gonna let you keep him. I guess, we can take him with us today... but, we can't keep this secret much longer. I mean, look at him. Go get dressed, alright? Honey, have you seen my glasses? What? These? There they are. Thanks, kids. It's okay. Trying to teach a chimp to skate, like that's gonna happen. [Mouthes] I want to assure you, that we here at the university, are dedicated to getting back Jack. Jack back. Is it true many of the alumni have threatened to withold their donations this year until Jack is found unharmed? [Stammers] ...No Comment. [KNOCKS] Hello! Hello? Mrs. Westover! It's so nice to finally meet you. We're early. -Oh, just an hour. [LAUGHS] Thank you so much for allowing the use your house for the metting today. Well, usually Rosemary would have the meeting at her house... But, ya know... Since she's in the middle of refurbishing her sofa. [Laughs] You have a coffee stain on your shirt. -Oh, come on in. Hi... Welcome, Come on in. -O...kay. You stay here. Be good. If I could have everyone's attention, please. As we bring our meeting to order. Now... the first item on our agenda is... dog stuff. Now it has been brought to my attention, that some of our neighbours have experienced... Well, lets just call them incidences on their front lawns. [Chattering] Thought they'd left. Would you please excuse me? Have to refill the tray. -Oh yes, of course. [Indistinct Chatter] ... Which she then proceeded to get all over my new carpet! -Eileen, I think it's your turn to speak. -Thank you. [Screams] Hello again everybody! This is Willy Drucker, the voice of the Nuggets. Coming from you live from the Nelson Arena. Tonight, the Nuggets go head to head against the Kamloops Buchaneers. [ORGAN PLAYING quickly] [Very unenthusiastically] Charge! Get him Moose! Hanging waist. [Grunts] Alright Moose! Yeah, that's it! Hey Bill! You keep your fingers crossed. Maybe we're gonna win one tonight. Ok? Oh, hey! Okay boys! Let's go! Let's hustle! Way to hustle! Yeah! You're playing like you wanna win. Moose! Get physical, that's what I've been trying to teach ya, pal. We stay on a track, we may actually win this game. [Whispers] You didn't put anything in the water, did ya, caffeine or something? -No way! [Cheering] -Yeah! [Nervously] Uhh, Uhh... Where'd it go? Somebody help me! -Magoo, it's in the corner. -Thanks Moose! This corner? -Okay, there it is. The Buch's player takes posession. He shoots, he scores! -These teams are knotted at 2 a piece. Come on guys! Skate, Skate Skate, Skate! Let's Go! [Mouthes] Looks like Ripchimpski is back. Wait a minute. It can't be. He's on the bench. Whoever he is, he just intercepted a pass... and he is FLYINGGG down the wing. WOW! New guy is fast. He's so little. I think he's from California too. The little guy winds up... A blistering shot! HE SCORES! [Cheering] That was sweet! -What was that? -Who was that? -Holy Toledo, that guy's good. -What a minute! It's a monkey! [SILENCE] [LAUGHING] Looks like Coach Marlow is up to his old tricks again [LAUGHING] [Whistle] Ineligable Player. No Goal. Sorry about that coach. It'll never happen again. Well, that's too bad. Looked like a keeper. -Hey Mom. -Hey honey. How was your meeting? [Sarcastically] Oh Great. Until one of the ladies decided she saw a monkey outside the window. Hey... Where's Tara? -Oh... Mom. Tara has something she wants to show you. Oh my goodness. Well, thank you for looking. Goodbye. No one seems to be missing a Chimp. All the chimps at the zoo seem to be accounted for. Let me tell you what I predict. If you do this... You'll have so many people will be coming to the games. You won't have enough seats to put em all in. Wait up. Technically he's a chimp. But they say the chimp is our closest relative. You may have a point there. It's just like your sister Mavis joining the team. Well, that may not be the best example. But I know what you mean. -Think of all the increased revenue, Harry. Come on. Let me lay my cards on the table here. We all know you've been losing money for years on these teams, okay? We know you have a profit sharing plan. So if this works out, it's not just the Nuggets who cash in, we're all gonna make some bucks. Think about it! -Yeah Harry! Then I could be buying that Nintendo my son's been on about all year. I say we vote yes! I think the coach has a relevant thing here, eh? I say at least we'll win at the Box Office. - Well, all those in favour? Say Aye! [All] AYE! Oh-ho, You are not going to regret this. Believe me. You will not regret this! YES! For those of you who haven't noticed... our hairy little cousin has been invited to join the team. Ohh, I thought you were talking about my cousin Ernest. Are we gonna have like Monkey bars in here and stuff? -No. As of last night, the board has offiically amended the rules. So that Jack can be part of the nuggets. [Laughs] What? You mean we have a monkey on our team? - With the help of this chimp, not a monkey, we may have a Championship season, guys. Uh... don't you mean a "Chimp"-ionship, sir? [LAUGHS] Coach, are we on Candid Camera? Holy Chimp! -Man! On skates he's a bullet. Excuse me! Are you guys waiting for an invitation to go practice? Get on the ice! Let's go! Okay guys! Give me your best shot! Let's see what you're made of. Hey guys! Try to hit the net, I need some practice here! Huh? -Finally! [All] Oooohhhhhhh [LAUGHS] [LAUGHING] Here we go! Souvenir Peanuts! The hard hitting Vikings have entered the arena. If they win this game, they clinch a spot for themselves for the Playoffs. And if the Nuggets lose, they have absolutely no chance of making the Playoffs. WAIT A MINUTE! The monkey is back! The crowd is going bananas! Don't worry Jack. They're all cheering for you. Jack! Come on, Jack! Come on guys! Change it up! Hustle, Hustle, Hustle! Harold! You better cover that Chimp! Uh-oh! The Vikings have sent out Harold, their top Defenseman to cover Jack. Where is he? Where is he guys? Oh and check it out, folks! Jack is making a monkey out of the Viking defenseman! What's the matter Harold, can't cover your player, eh? Come on now, get outta here! I always said, these guys are winners! Well folks, that's it. The Nuggets have their first victory of the season. Alright, Alright! Way to Play! Way to Hustle! We finally won one! I knew we could do it! Way to go gentlemen, Way to go! Hey! Way to play Chimp! And you too guys... you were good. Don't worry, Tara. You'll do just fine. -What if they make fun of me? -They won't. Bye! His name is Jack. He speaks with his names, but not in ASL like me. His favourite foods are bananas, raisins and Jube Jubes. Ready Magoo? I'm gonna go top right, alright? -Yeah! I'm ready. Just shoot. I scored. -Where'd it go? Where'd it go? You can't see, can you? Of course I can see. I didn't shoot the puck Magoo. Well, I can see the big things. -Magoo, you're a goalie. Come on... I've got an idea. Let's go. Lights out. Will Jack be able to stay with us forever? No. We can't keep Jack forever. I'm sure Jack has a family of his own somewhere. But we can keep Jack for now. Oh, come here, baby. Alice, for heaven's sake. You're never gonna get that on there. Hey Mark. Caching, Caching. Thank you sir! Nice save. -Thanks, man. -Good job! [Crowd Cheering] MAGOO! Here ya go, buddy! Another win for the Nuggets, now they're just one game away from going all the way to the Harvest Cup. And that's gonna be a tough one. Because they're up against their old arch-rivals, The Kitimat Tigers. Scott moves up the wing. OHH! He's bulled by the Tiger bench. Ohh Yeah! [Laughing] It's 2 all with less than 14 seconds left. It looks like we'll be going into Overtime. No Goal. [Crowd Booing] Get a pair of glasses, ref! What's up? Check the net. Tara, Jack missed. Hold on, it appears that the Golden Nuggets Captain has asked the referee to check the net for a hole. It's a goal! [Crowd Cheering] The Nuggets are going all the way to the Harvest Cup! I understand, sir. The alumni will not provide funds unless Jack is safely returned. [TV] And now for today's play by play. Nelson, BC is going ape over their newest hockey hero, Jack. A young chimpanzee. His blistering slapshot has helped turn around a 40 game losing streak. Leading them to win the Junior B Championship. [Stammering] - [Shounting] Dr. Peabody!! I'll have that chimp back within 48 hours! Get me Einsteen! Pete. Woah... Check out the size of that building! Man... totally sure, we aren't in Kansas anymore. Well boys... this is it. It's the big time. This is my 15 minutes of fame. Man, this place rocks! Aww, man. I gotta take a seat. I love the smell of zamboni fumes in the morning. Welcome to Harvest Cup! Section 117. Welcome hockey fans! We're broadcasting live from GM Place in Vancouver. This is the final of the Harvest Cup. Between the Nelson Golden Nuggets and the Calgary Polar Bears. And who would've though, Don. That the Nelson Golden Nuggets would be here all the way at the Harvest Cup, after a string of loses they suffered earlier in the season. This is a Cinderella story like few have ever seen. These Nuggets might lose a hole, because they're up against the toughest Junior A team in the country, The Calgary Polar Bears. And as usual the stands are full of scouts tonight, as they look at the finest display of talent in Western Canada. Don't worry, Jack. It's just another game alright? Play hard. Boy-o-Boy, it's 1-0 for the Polar Bears before the first whistle. Your Nuggets are reeling already. I wouldn't count the Nuggets out yet, Don. Remember it's not over til it's over. Woo! Magoo is in the house! Advantage has to go to the Polar Bears. The Nuggets haven't mustered any offense at all. [HORN BLARES] Hey, kid. Have you seen this chimp? - Where is the Golden Nuggets locker room? Wait! Come back here! Hey Tara! Hey Steven... -Hey, what's up? Some guys want to take Jack? -Whats going on? -Some guy wants to take Jack. -There she is! -Dr. Peabody, Pueblo University. -Hi, I'm Coach Marlow. You're not thinking about taking our star player, now are ya? Because that would really throw a monkey wrench into something that these big strapping strong young hockey players have worked a long time to work for. We have a court order and we're not leaving without that chimp! Is that a fact? Huh? This area by the way is only for hockey players. Which you are not. So unless you're gonna put on some skates. You'll have to excuse me. -Have a nice day. -Tootles. -I want that... [Stammers] Come on you guys! Steven! Up the middle! Holy Cow! What a blistering piece of rubber! So, what are we gonna do now? We'll get him at the end of the game, before he leaves the ice. We have all the exits covered. What's up? Oh, there they are. What'd they say? End of the game, huh? Thanks. Well I never would've imagined it, but this could be the hardest fought contest in the hardest Cup, we've seen in a long time. Hey, what's up? What's this? This is where Jack's from? Jack, I know they're taking you away at the end of the game. I was knitting this hat for you. It's not quite done yet. But I wanted you to have it. I'm sure gonna miss you Jack. Hey, Coach. I guess you know I've been healthy for months. Yeah, I knew that Pete. It takes a man to admit that. - Man, I sure love playing. ...Maybe even as much as Jack. Woah, hey. You wanna stop blaming yourself? They've got a court order to take Jack. There's nothing you can do about it. Okay? Yeah, I guess you're right. Hey Coach. I've got an idea to save Jack. Hello? Hi. This is Steven Westover. I'm calling about a chimpanzee. Jack, yeah! That's it. Perfect. I don't believe it. Right Winger Gold Nuggets Top Scorer Steven Westover is out with an injury. And he's been replaced by Captain Pete Ripchimpski, who's also returning from an injury. Well that's a real shame. Because Westover played well in that second period and had a couple of great scoring chances. Jack's gonna have to step forward and pick up his pace now that Westover's gone. Hey! Good to see you back on skates Ripchimpski. -Good to be back Coach. What are you standing around for? Go score me some goals! Let's Go! Sir... Can you put the radio on to the hockey game? If possible. [Radio] That save is huge! That puck was signed, sealed and delivered. Top shelf. Right side. 2 minutes, 30 seconds to go. -And it's a tie game! Come on, let's get ready. [Radio] The Nuggets managed just 2 shots on that Powerplay. This game's starting to open up a bit. Here we go! It's in! It's in! Goal! We Won! You hear that? We won! We won the Harvest Cup! Isn't that awesome? I am Dr. Heimlich Peabody and I have a court order to take this monkey back to Pueblo University. Now who are you calling a monkey? It's a girl. [LAUGHING] -Thank You. -Have a nice flight. Hey. Well, this is it, you're on your way home, where you belong. With your family. Tara asked me to give you these. [SPEAKER] Final Boarding Call. -That's you. Gotta go now. We'll see you later, okay? Thank you. [CHEERING] How's Jack? -He's on his way. -You okay? -I'm fine. Did you hear? Magoo just got signed by the farm team for the Mighty Ducks! -That's Awesome! -Where's Jack? -He's on his way home. Westover! Come on! They can take your picture later. There's someone I want you to meet. This is Sam Richards, a good old friend of mine. Steven Westover. - Nice to meet you. Just wanted to invite you to join the team this fall. -He coaches a team in Vancouver, WHL. Now, it's a big commitment. Might want to discuss this with your folks. -Yeah. -I've already thought about it, that's awesome. I'll be there. -You call me. -Yeah, I will. -Alright, man. Way to go! JACK! Buddy, where ya been? What took you so long?
