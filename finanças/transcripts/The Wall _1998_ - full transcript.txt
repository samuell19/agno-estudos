DEAL ME IN. WAR IS THE EXTERNALIZED EXPRESSION OF A CULTURE'S SUBCONSCIOUS DESIRE TO PURGE ITSELF OF THE BEST AND BRIGHTEST OF EACH GENERATION. THE JEALOUS, CONSERVATIVE OLD MEN, THEY'RE FRIGHTENED BY THE YOUNG, VITAL MEN, SO THEY SACRIFICE THEM ON THE BATTLEFIELD TO PROTECT THE STATUS QUO... AND GET THE YOUNG PUSSY FOR THEMSELVES, RIGHT? ( chuckles ) WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU SMOKING, OLIVERA? SMOKE THIS! ( indistinct chatter ) I'LL TELL YOU WHAT WAR IS. WAR IS REAL ESTATE. GENERAL HARDROCKS SAYS, "I LIKE THAT PRETTY LITTLE VILLAGE. I'D LIKE TO RUN AN AMERICAN FLAG UP ITS FLAGPOLE, AND I'D BE WILLING TO KILL TWENTY 19-YEAR-OLD AMERICAN BOYS TO DO IT." GENERAL FISH-AND-RICE COMES ALONG AND SAYS, "NO, I THINK IT WOULD LOOK BETTER WITH UNCLE HO'S FLAG." I'M OUT. "AND I'D BE WILLING TO KILL THIRTY MEN AND WOMEN TO DO IT." GENERAL HARDROCKS UPS THE BET-- FIFTY DEAD, TWENTY WOUNDED. GENERAL FISH-AND-RICE SAYS, "I'LL KILL THIRTY MEN AND WOMEN AND SLAUGHTER EVERY MAN, WOMAN, AND CHILD IN THE VILLAGE." GENERAL HARDROCKS DOUBLES DOWN ON THE CASUALTIES, AND SAYS, "I'LL KILL EVERY MAN, WOMAN, AND CHILD IN THE VILLAGE, AND THEN BURN IT DOWN." GENERAL HARDROCKS WINS, RAISES THE OL' RED-WHITE-AND- BLUE, STANDS PROUD AND VICTORIOUS IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT PRETTY LITTLE VILLAGE, WHICH NOW, OF COURSE, IS A BURNED-OUT, DEAD FUCKIN' RUIN, BUT THEN OL' FISH-AND-RICE COMES AND SAYS, "I WANT THAT HILL." WHOLE THING STARTS ALL OVER AGAIN. ( snapping cards ) THE SECRET TO WAR IS NOT BEING A 19-YEAR-OLD BIDDING POINT. AH. BE A GENERAL. DON'T EVEN BE A FUCKING GENERAL. DON'T GET CLOSE TO REAL ESTATE. SELL ACCOUTREMENTS. "ACCOUTRE-WHATS"? ACCOUTREMENTS. ACCESSORIES, YOU NUMB-NUTS. SELL THE LITTLE REAL ESTATE "SOLD" SIGNS. SELL THE PINK FUCKING FLAMINGOS. LOOK, YOU WANNA GET RICH IN THIS WAR? GET A CONTRACT SELLING BODY BAGS. Man: TAKE FIVE, OKAY? WHAT? TAKE BREAK. TAKE FIVE, OKAY? YEAH, BUT LET'S MAKE IT FIVE, OKAY? I'M WATCHING THE CLOCK.

HE DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT THIS, AND I DON'T WANT HIM TO, TO FEEL, UH... GUILTY OR SOMETHING. YOU'RE A REAL SENSITIVE GUY. WHAT DO YOU WANT FOR HIM? SOMETHING SAFE... SAFE AS IT GETS AROUND HERE. CAN YOU DO THAT? A GRUNT-- A RECON GRUNT, NO LESS-- WANTS A REAR-ECHELON GHOST JOB. YOU GOT SOME LEAD YOU WANT ME TO TURN INTO GOLD WHILE YOU'RE AT IT? ( laughter ) CAN YOU DO IT? HELL... I'M THE KING. I CAN DO ANYTHING. IT'S GONNA COST YOU, THOUGH, PAL. HOW MUCH? WELL... THAT I'VE GOT TO THINK ABOUT. WHY DON'T YOU GIVE ME A COUPLE OF MINUTES. OKAY. ALL RIGHT. HEY, UH... YOU THINK THE GUITARIST WOULD MIND IF I CHECKED OUT HIS TELE? HE SHOULDN'T. IT'S MINE. I RENT IT TO HIM. YOU PLAY? YEAH, SOME. YEAH, SURE. GO AHEAD. JUST DON'T BREAK IT. HOW DO WE DO THIS? OH, FUCK, BISHOP. TRANSFERS ARE BROADAXE'S GAME. WE DON'T FUCK WITH BROADAXE. BROADAXE HAS BEEN DIPPING INTO MY BANGKOK SCAM. WHO-- WHO CAME UP WITH THAT BANGKOK SCAM? YOU DID. ME, THAT'S RIGHT.
