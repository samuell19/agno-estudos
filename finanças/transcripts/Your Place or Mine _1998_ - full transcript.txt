Can you remember your shortest relationship? How about your longest? When you get older, your memory becomes worse. You only know that you've twenty-four hours a day. eight hours for work and eight hours for sleep. So what do you do with the remaining eight hours? You find a good-looking person who doesn't despise you... to hug, kiss and love in the remaining eight hours. According to an unofficial statistics report, a person breathes in secondhand smoke 3869 times on average in his life; get heartbroken 7.8 times; lose a job 4.2 times; have extramarital affairs 0.99 times and have a 0.5 secret admirer. But no one is definite he can find one true love. Have you found it? You have? Really? Like me, every time I thought I'd found it. The girl always ended up breaking my heart. When I open my eyes every morning, I only see boxes of tombstones. Seriously. There are boxes of them. I don't know if they were busy after they broke up with me... or those girls I knew just didn't like taking their things away. Not only did they leave me, they also left me with a pile of useless things. To throw or not to throw them away doesn't really make a difference. Recently, I added another box. If this goes on, Ill need to expand my place. Kay Heung. Left me for some rich dude I'm from HK Market Research Centre. I need you to help in a survey. —Sorry, I'm in a hurry. —The survey is a very simple one. You should do your market research in the supermarket, not with me. You're the most handsome man I've seen today. I mean it. Since you're telling the truth and I can't rebut it, OK, let's do it. Sir, when's the last time you used a condom? —What? —Sorry, I should ask this question first. Have you used a condom before? —Of course. —When was your first time using it? When... I can't remember. Did you buy it or your partner did? I didn't buy it; I think I stole it from my dad. What about now? Do you buy it or does she volunteer to do so? Does she volunteer? She's more proactive; I'm always passive. How many do you use each time? This is very personal. In good form, about three to seven. Go to the next question; I'm in a hurry. OK. Have you ever tried these brands before? Sweet love, Wind and Cloud, Thunder Sex Machine, Never Say Die... Happiness Hero, Loving You Drives Me Crazy... Let me take it home and read it. I'll fax my responses back to you, OK? I think I didn't use it the last time. How about the time before the last... Who did I do it with? What a pity. Wai got dumped again. No wonder he hasn't come to work these couple of days. He's used to being dumped. That's right. Every time Wai makes a young potential famous, they won't stay and will fly away! —Who flew away? —Wai, good morning... We've a new challenge, everyone. We're changing the story board for our pitch completely. —It's already done... —You can throw it away. —Where's the script? —It's in Patrick's room. Wai, what are you looking for? Where's your junior high schoolmate? Patrick? He was still here just now. This is not for you; it's for Patrick. Sorry! What's this? It's honey. He has a sore throat. Why is it bitter? I got it. Everyone needs love. With love, we'll grow... We'll grow... and grow and grow... Grow... Come out, Patrick! What's up? No need to memorise; we've to change it. What's wrong with you? Why are you always doing this? Are you trying to make things difficult for us? I tried contacting you to no avail. Where have you been? I went to "stand" last night. What? —What? —Stand... A one-night stand. You understand, my friend? It looks awesome. Of course. It's like Spain against Nigeria. It was out of this world! You'll be dead meat if Fun gets to know about it. I only got this rare opportunity because she went home with her parents. By the way, talking about you... Don't be depressed. If the old one doesn't go, how can the new one come? —Just like Kay Heung... —Stop it! I'm your buddy. Why can't we talk about it? Please look into the mirror. Do you know how dry you are? Done. If anything is not right, fix it yourself. Are you serious? Are you mad? What's this world lacking in most? What does a person always want? That's right. It's the thing we've always wanted... love. So... this is love. All parents want their kids to feel their love. Good kids, better parents. Your diapers... are going to sell better and better. And we'll do the best for you in advertising and promotion. Love should feel good. First, look at this. There are many companies supporting us. Patrick. Remember, dinner at eight tonight. Dinner? What dinner? We'd arranged to meet Sai Meng and some others. Remember? Oh! Yes... But I'd promised my mum to go back for soup. You know, I haven't seen her for a month... Be a good son is more important, I guess. Where are we going? Kowloon Tong Motel, OK? What? I'm not going there! Then where should we go? Let's go to your place? My place? OK! Forever Jewellery, with you forever. Why did you dump me, Kay Heung? What do you want me to do? It's not what I want. You just never understand. What do I not understand? I understood it fully. He's filthy rich and that's why you left me. Wai, a wrecked relationship is not the fault of just one party. You've had many chances but you refused to change. What's there to change? Yes, sometimes I do overreact a little... —But that's my... —Your personality, right? But that doesn't mean you can hurt others. If you like me, you should accept my shortcomings. I was serious about you. But only briefly! At the beginning, we wanted to stick together every moment. But after a while, your attitude changed. You complained that I was annoying and boring... as if I didn't exist. I was just stressed with my work. I'm in the creative business; I need space to think... You're selfish! You said you'd be with me forever. Darn, I've forgotten your name. You were my first love. Of course, I'd tell you it's forever. But you broke my heart and caused me to lose faith in all men. Now I've become a lesbian. No wonder you didn't come look for me. Do you know what's wrong with you now? There's nothing wrong! 99.9% of men are like this. You don't know how to treasure a relationship. You're also a stupid man who doesn't know how to love a woman. You don't understand women at all! You don't need me to take you home? No. I'll stay over at my friend's place tonight. Why do you have to stay over at your friend's place? It's because she got dumped. She got dumped? Do you want me to go with you to help comfort her? No. I'll call you again, OK? Let's see. —Bye. —Bye. What the hell? How can you use my room? Do you think I want to? She didn't want to go to Kowloon Tong Motel. We'd nowhere to go so we came here. Good thing I came. You didn't lock the door; that was dangerous. You're taking my house as a motel then? If you want to fool around, take her to your place! I'd promised myself. If I want to fool around, I must do it outside. If Fun comes over suddenly, I'll be caught red-handed. So you're the great boyfriend now without getting caught. Enough! Go tidy up my room now! I'll kill you if it happens again! Why so vicious? When did you become a referee? Hi, Simon. Dad, why are you here so late? I came to watch soccer. There's a power failure at my place. Dad, turn the volume up. I can't hear anything. You watch the game; not listen to it. Those comperes just talk rubbish; they don't make sense. They're not comperes; they're called soccer commentators. That's right. I'm at Wai's place, watching soccer. He got dumped so I'm keeping him company. You got dumped again? I didn't foul but she gave me a red card. I can't help it either. Why did she give you a red card for no reason? Why didn't your dead mum give me one? Tell me the truth. Did you ever cheat on Mum? Go ask the players if they cheat. Everyone would deny it for sure. Tell me the truth, Simon. Did you? Do you need to even ask? Every man knows the answer. I don't get it. If you want to fool around outside, why bother keeping one at home? Those are two different matters. Exactly! Just like soccer, you need a backup. Simon, you can't be more right. The more backups, the better it is. It's already so hard to find the key player... how am I going to find a backup? Perhaps every backup thinks that she's the key player at first. Just like Patrick's backup, the Shanghainese girl, Fun. She has been with Patrick for five years... but all she knows is to clean his house every week. She's more like a maid than a girlfriend. Get up. I got you breakfast. Dad was asking why you can't even have tea with them on Sundays. Just tell him I've things to do. I did. Are there any other ways of telling him? You haven't paid the credit card bills? Oh, right. I'll write you a cheque later. Help me pay it tomorrow. When did you go to a hotel? What hotel? Do you remember that American client? I almost had to pay for his prostitution bill. How terrible! Why? That lecherous client... Patrick needs to just use one of his numerous lies and Fun will fall for it. Forget it; it's OK. What? You thought I went fooling around with another girl, right? —Am I right? —How would I know? You're never home. If you don't trust me, test me... No... let's go to the room. —No, I like it here. —Go get the condom. I don't want to use a condom... What if we've a baby? Are we going to get married? OK... I'll get it. Michael? I will be back. Yes, it's urgent. The office, please. Hey... —I've called you many times! Bad news... —What happened? They're going to fire a lot of people. Even my boss has been fired. What should we do? I know. I saw it. Why don't I get a transfer to your department? Honestly, have you heard anything about retrenchment at our department? No. We're dead meat I'm afraid I can't get along well with the new boss. They said she's a lesbian. Her name is Vivian Ng. She graduated from UCLA and has a PhD. She has worked in two top advertising companies in the US. Come in. Oh... of course! —Great. —Who's she? She's 1.73m tall; 34, 23, 34. She has fired a third of the staff in less than three hours. —And she's a lesbian. —Sure. How do you know she's a lesbian? Look at her legs. Maybe I'll send you the schedule next Monday. What's with her legs? Her toes. See them? Toes? How can you tell? Great. You too! Thanks for calling. Bye. Sorry, it's a long distance call. Vivian Ng. Cheung Sook Wai. Mr Cheung, have a seat here. Please be on time for meetings in future. What? No excuse, OK? Don't argue. We'd be lucky to be able to attend a meeting next time. JET hired you two to form BEST three years ago. You're responsible for the local clients in Hong Kong. But from now on, you won't have that freedom anymore. Whatever you say since you're the boss now. If you don't like it, fire us too. No, what Wai really means is that... BEST is confident to work with JET in difficult times. Since you click so well, take your time to chit-chat. —I'm going on a long vacation. —Mr Cheung is really an artist. But this isn't the time for an artist attitude. Our HQ is very happy with your performance... so you'll be given more international projects to handle. I believe that's a wise decision. They're right to make the best use of talent. But, Mr Cheung, you may need to change your attitude. What do you mean? You're a talented creative director. But you're too low key. Yeah. —Yeah. —Yeah what? She's right. Look at yourself. You always dress so sloppily. You do the packaging for others but don't know how to dress yourself up. I want you to meet more media and clients; it'd benefit our company. He does sometimes appear on the papers, such as the gossip columns... I've another meeting. We'll talk again later. —Thank you. —Bye. By the way, I've a dinner meeting with the MD of Japan's Tomy next week. Mr Cheung, you've to come along too. —Me? —No excuse. Oh... —She likes you. —What are you talking about? —She just dated you. Didn't you hear? —I don't care. —Oh no! You like her! —What? She made you so hot... There are sparks of love. I think it's time you change your tastes. I wonder what it will feel like to do it with a lesbian. Gosh! Hey, tell me about the toes. One more over here. —Put it properly. —OK... Boss, it's ready. Are you kidding? Where do these people come from? I want these! Where have they all gone to? Patrick said the company is cutting budget. Yes, Mr Wai. I heard GWT and LB... are spending a lot to do the Project Pre-sell. Boss, there's no way you can win this time. Come here. Take one each. Get changed now. —Forget it. —This... They're all here. —My boss is not satisfied. —Come on! They cost four hundred each. I'd a hard time looking for them in the red-light district. That's all for today. Pay them their wages. That's all for today, folks! Who is it? Who is it? Come out! I said come out. Who is it? Stand there! Don't move! Yes... Where are the rest? Don't bother. Just don't move. Are you the photographer? Who's going to pay me? I'll pay you later when I'm done. How long will this take? My leg is hurting. OK... We're almost done. Hang on. Excellent. A bit to your left... I can't stand it anymore... It hurts! You're so lousy. You got cramps after standing for a little while. I'd already stood on the street the whole day. On the street? I understand... What do you understand? There's no such thing as a right or wrong profession. You're a new immigrant, right? I've only been here for two weeks. Two weeks only and you've become a hook... I mean... a worker. Yes. I'm working for my aunt. She has a fishball stall. She's short-handed so I'm helping her for now. "Fishball stalls" (brothels) still exist? Of course! We've a lot of customers. Come when you're free; I'll give you a discount. That's not necessary. I don't like that kind of thing. Are you feeling better? Why don't you take a little rest? We'll continue later. We still have to continue? It's late and I don't know how to get back. I'll get you a taxi. It's done. Look Mr Photographer, I'm really tired and sleepy. I took five hundred dollars from you, being payment of my wage and taxi fare. Come visit me when you're free. Hope to see you again, Yu. —Thank you. —You're welcome. Haven't we made it clear the last time? You don't have to tell everyone. My reputation has been ruined by you! OK... we'll talk tonight. Bye. Do you want an egg tart? Why are you so upset? You fought with your girlfriend? Do you have any plans after work? Let me buy you dinner. You're on time. You too. I miss you very much. Since we're just out to have fun, let's not be so serious. So what? I like to have fun with you. We'd a great time the last time. OK. Since we're friends, let's end things here. What do you mean? You're dumping me? It won't be that easy. What will make you give him up then? Honey! Let me speak. Patrick has already told me about your relationship with him. It's only for fun. I suggest you forget about him. You're young and pretty. Lots of men will fight over you. But I only like your husband. Can't I? Times have changed. If you can't watch over him, he'll start fooling around outside. As his wife, just pretend that you don't know anything. —How can you say such things? —Forget it... Call me if you've time. I don't mind. —Are you all right? —What kind of girl is that? The young girls are all like that. Does your girlfriend know you're cheating on her? I think she does; she can probably guess it. Have you ever thought about marrying her? Marrying her? My parents, brothers and sisters, aunts and uncles, all are divorced. But that doesn't mean you can't have a blissful marriage. You don't understand. I'm promiscuous by nature. You're crazy! It's true. Do you think I'm born with too much hormones? —I think I'm beyond hope... —Don't make yourself sound so bad. —I'll take you home. —No need. Me? I'm at Lan Kwai Fong. No way! They're all there? OK... I'll be there right away. My friend is having a birthday party at Club 97. Come with me? —No, you go ahead. —Don't be shy. Come on! —No, you go. —You're really not going? Mei Mei, thank you for your help just now. You're welcome! OK. Bye. Bye... Sir, please help your girlfriend. What happened to you? Thank you... What happened to you? If you can't drink, don't drink so much. I can't hold you if you lean on me like this. I'll leave you here on the street! Taxi! Taxi! Where are you going, sir? Where? What? Kowloon Tong. What? Kowloon Tong. She said Kowloon Tong. Then go to Kowloon Tong. Are we really going to Kowloon Tong Motel? Relax... Why are you so heavy? Are you very tired? I've an idea. Use this wet towel to wake yourself up. Have you fallen asleep? You wanted to come to a motel... but ended up sleeping here. What about me then? I think you're the first man in Hong Kong to bring a girl to a motel... but instead of sleeping with her, you played with her toes. I'm unlike you. I won't be so shameless to take advantage of her when she's drunk. She offered herself... and asked to be taken to a motel. Maybe she likes you... and wanted you to help her to become normal again. She was too drunk to know what happened to her. No matter how good I am, she wouldn't know it. She might even accuse me of rape. I'd be in deep trouble then. Yes, that sounds reasonable. If that ever happens again... you should call me to the room immediately to help out. —Speak. —Boss. Miss Ng wants Mr Wai to see her in her office right away. Go turn yourself in. I said to go to Kowloon Tong? I can get the taxi driver here. He can be my witness. I wanted to go to Kowloon Tong because I live there. Seriously? But you didn't tell me your address, so I... Fine... I understand. That's enough. Did you touch me? Yes. No... —What? —I swear! Calm down. You did! You must have touched me. Where did you touch? Where? Well... My upper body? —My lower body? —Only your toes. My toes? Are you a pervert? Why did you touch my toes? That's because your toes are very... What? Sexy. Don't worry, I won't tell anyone. From this minute onwards, what happened last night... —I've forgotten everything! —Wai! —It's great... —What are you doing? IDM likes our concept... and they want this girl specifically to be the image girl! —She? —Who's she? Is she a model? Where did you find such a pretty girl? I heard she works at a "fishball stall." "Fishball stall"? Look at her face carefully. For the sake of a thirty-million deal... you must find this girl within forty-eight hours! If there are any new girls, call me at once, OK? —OK, no problem. —Bye. Did you find her? Yes, she's making a deal in the conference room. She's a hawker, selling fishballs on the street... and you said she's a hooker working in a brothel. You almost led us on a wild goose chase. Selling fishballs? Where are you going? That girl will only sign the contract if it's in Chinese. If she doesn't know English, she shouldn't be selling fishballs. Are you kidding? If she knows English, she doesn't need to sell fishballs. Hey Mr Photographer! You're awesome; you made me look so pretty. I almost can't recognise myself. Tony, I've got to go. —Thank you, Lawyer Ho. —You're welcome. I only found out you're a famous person yesterday. Look! They said you're the famous image consultant, Cheung Sook Wai. They've ruined my handsome image. I should be selective next time. Forget about the translation. See if we can copy from this contract. By the way... did your lesbian boss sexually harass you? I'm smart; I stop wearing low-cut dresses. —You are exceptionally well endowed. —To hell with you! There's nothing wrong with being well endowed. It's only an issue if you have a killer body but no brains. Look! I'm big chested too. Mine is even bigger than yours. Do yours shake? Shake? That's my forte. How fast do you want it? I'll let you feel it. Don't poke! Touch it. OK, but you can't touch mine. OK. Come on! Quickly. You're right; it really shakes! Am I good? Watch out, it's turbo time! —This is so awesome! —Of course. The right side is even more powerful. Feel it. Both hands, come on! Don't be shy! This is so interesting! With you shaking it like this, will you get internal injury? Of course not. All right, it's the real deal now. Richter scale of seven —You're insane... —Am I good? Don't you enjoy it? You're really good! Keep going, don't stop. I'm tired. It's over. Let me rest. Hurry up... —It's your turn. —You want me to kill you? Then the contract... It's lunch time. Enjoy yourself! Where do you work out? Get me the membership form. It's all your fault! Can I really make a lot of money? It's surely better than selling fishballs. Discuss it with your family first. I don't have a family. My dad died before I was born. My mum died shortly after my birth. An orphan? A sob story? It was my aunt who got me to Hong Kong. Aunt said Hongkongers are very sly. I live in a place with many other groups of people. There are people peeping at me when I take my shower every night. I'll try to talk to the company and get them to put you up at a hotel. Great! Why don't you be my manager? —What? —No excuse! I know you're going to say this! Just as I expected! You should be her manager. She'll be famous after this commercial. —Then you will get rich... —Enough said. I'm not doing it this time. Are you afraid of something? —What? —What? You don't have to do that this time, right? What happens if I do? —You like her? Are you that loose? —You're the one who's loose! —That girl you took to my house... —Excuse me! What are you guys talking about? We're talking about that night... —No. He's afraid of... —Don't say it. I'll fall out with you. OK... I won't say it... Convince him. Quit thinking. You don't even know what we're talking about. You're worried that you'll fall for that girl, right? Can't you control yourself? Can you control such things? —Why not? —You mean you can? Of course! What happens if I can't? —No... —No excuse! Is that all the English you know? Dad, you came to watch soccer again? I forgot. I waited for the whole night but there's actually no game on tonight. My memory is failing me. Power failure at your place again? Don't get started. Last night after Croatia defeated Germany... I was so mad I broke the television. You've got a real bad temper. Your friend Pat has a worse temper. He took a girl upstairs. Are they still there? They're taking their showers. What? Come out, rascal! Do you think my place is a motel? You're really cheap! You even skimp on motel charges? Come out! I'm going to call Fun and expose your secret. Let her catch you cheating on her red-handed! —Hello. —Be gentle to her. —What? —She's still young, be gentle. You're back? Why are you here? Your... Your friend brought me here. He told me to keep you company tonight. Awesome! No... why do you need to accompany me? He said if I stay here with you tonight, you'll be my manager. To help you get rid of the bad experiences from the past... I don't really understand what he was talking about. But... the magazines and newspapers always say... the entertainment circle is very complicated. I guess... that's the price I've to pay. You're saying that I'm one of those who will take advantage of newcomers? It says here that you're "the player behind the scenes." This is only hearsay. You won't understand. Go get changed. I don't need you to stay here tonight. What about tomorrow night? No need. In the future? Future? We'll talk about it in the future. I don't talk about things that happen after twenty-four hours. So you agree to be my manager? I don't know yet. Go get changed now or I'll sleep with you. Hurry up. OK. Your friend said that all your ex-girlfriends were very pretty. But they all "flew away." —What does that mean? —What? Flew away. That means... they left on a plane. I see. Have you heard of the story about waiting for a bus? What story? An indecent story? No! Actually... love is like waiting for a bus. Sometimes you'll think the bus is too old... and you don't want to get on it. Or you don't want to take the bus without air-conditioning because it's too hot. Then a crowded bus comes along and you don't want to be squeezed. So you wait and wait until it becomes dark and you get anxious. So when the next bus comes along, you board it right away. But look! You got on the wrong bus! Yes, but you'd already paid and waited for so long. Do you want to alight and wait for another one? You don't know when the next one will come. Take a taxi then. There are no taxis around! Then I'll walk. It's not a big deal. Yes! Breaking up is like walking. Understand? Where did you learn such stories from? Women magazines. You should read it too so you understand women better and won't get dumped. Have you ever got on a wrong bus? I used to ride bicycles; I don't like taking buses. After hearing Yu's bus story about love... and seeing Brazil lost to France, I decided... not to ride anymore. Isn't such flu medicine sold here in Hong Kong? My cousin said no. This is a trial drug and you can only get it at government hospitals. They're still testing this drug? Will it kill me? Just take it! It won't kill you. I'm just asking. Do you have to be so fierce? You ingrate; I'm just trying to help you. Your house is pretty tidy. You've a maid to clean up for you? What is it? —What is it? —Nothing. I choked. I've something to show you. Can you tell which one is you and which one is me? It's so small, how can I tell? Do you have a magnifying glass? Just try. This is you. You're good. How can you tell? Of course I can! You were the ugliest one in class then. You were the ugly one! —You looked like Mickey Mouse. —I was so handsome. Back then, you always took my sandwiches... and lied to me that you'd take me to Disneyland. Then you said there were sharks and you wouldn't take me there. I was so mad and cried for many nights at home. You still remember what I said back then? Of course I do. No... Sorry. Not today. I'm going down to get cigarettes. Bye. Look! Is this pretty? Miss, you said you were going to buy a pair of shoes. I need a dress to match the shoes. Look, is it pretty? Do you need a hat then? Yes... —Isn't it pretty? —Why don't you buy underwear too? —I did. —No need to show it to me! You bought all these in just ten minutes. This kind of clothes doesn't suit you. If you want to buy clothes, tell me. I'll buy for you. That won't do... as that means I'll lose a woman's biggest enjoyment. If you don't trust me, I can't be your manager. Fine. I trust you. Mr Cheung, she can try on the make-up now. OK. After the make-up, change into these clothes. You look like a red packet. Luckily, there are no bulls on the streets or they'll charge at you. She's cute. I heard you've found a new star. Is that her? She's too small and short. Will people like her? Being tall doesn't mean anything. This isn't a basketball match. You weren't very popular when you first started. Yes, thanks to you. Why didn't you come and look for me? We're no longer lovers but we can still be friends. I don't see any point in being friends with my ex-girlfriends. So you're still mad at me? Forget it then. But it looks like you've changed; your standards are getting lower. You're using sub-standard models now. I made you famous so anything is possible. If I were you, I wouldn't try so hard to make her famous, so she can stay with you forever. What's wrong with you? Don't tell me you're too tired. I'm mad! She called me a sub-standard model. But you're not. —What do you think? —Of course not! You're so pretty. Good! I believe you. What's wrong now? I'm not mad; I'm very happy. She mocked at me because she was jealous. Am I right? I don't know what you're talking about. You don't understand the mentality of women. I told you to read women magazines. Did you listen to me? I read every issue of "Playboy." No! I meant magazines for women. Men don't read women magazines. Am I a pervert? It's OK to learn more things. Starting from today, I'll pick up English... learn make-up and fashion design as well. I don't want to be a sub-standard model. I want to be the most famous queen of commercials! Come down first before you fall, Queen. Good. Let's continue shopping. What? The company has a small budget. Don't be such a miser. You're going to make me famous... so you'll have to spend some money. Make them eat their words. Come on! I'll die before you become famous! You brought a girl back? It's useless to explain. When a girl wants to leave you, she'll have countless excuses. She'll have many tricks up her sleeve and she'll show hand. That spells the end. Do you understand? But there's really nothing between Mei Mei and I. Then it's not worthwhile. But you deserved it if there is. Are you my friend? Can't you comfort me with some nice words? Since Fun has finally decided to let go, take it in your stride and let her go. Fine. I'll go kill myself tonight... so I won't hurt people anymore. You're into drug trafficking? It's my personal collection. If you're my friend, bring out those bottles of red wine and let's drink them up. Over my dead body! Go buy your own wine. I'm saving those for my girlfriend and I. It's my secret weapon. OK, I'll go get it! Your situation now is called "walking." Yes, walking to my doom. Have you heard of the bus story? Darn, I forgot the story. Anyway, when you get on the last bus, you won't get on the wrong bus again. Why are you eating my noodles? Don't call an ambulance for me when I pass out later. Open it yourself. On the day of my funeral, if I get every girl I slept with to attend... it will be such a party, won't it? Do you want to hold it at a soccer stadium? No, that's too cheap. Repulse Bay. It has to be on the beach... with all the girls wearing bikinis... —Very nice... —Why do the noodles taste weird? Isn't it good? Do you want the Spice Girls to put on a live show? I really love her! She dumped me! I want to sleep with her! She just wants... to go shopping with me! I really like her! I... What are you doing? You haven't played it for a while and have forgotten the lyrics? I want to puke. Don't take weed if you can't take it. I didn't take weed. You just ate a whole bowl of "weed noodles." I can't take weed! I'll pass out! Don't scare me... Hello, Mei Mei. Do you know CPR? Wai is in trouble. He's acting like Ronaldo now. What happened to him? He's not responsive and his heart has stopped momentarily. Take him to the hospital for gastric lavage. We can't! What happens if the cops find out? But I don't know how to do gastric lavage. Just give it a try. Go get the hose. Quickly! Hurry up! Where's the hose? I found it. —Wake up, Wai... —Wake up... Why isn't he awake yet? Come on, wake up. Hey... —Continue... —He's responding... Why is he so devastated? It's not him; he's innocent. I broke up with Fun. What? She saw the glass. She thought I brought a woman home. Try explaining it to her. There's no love between us anymore. What's the point in continuing the relationship? It's all my fault. Don't be like this. You're the only one in this world who understands me. Rascal... You used me as an experiment? You used me? Little did I expect the first time I'd an illicit gastric lavage. It was more like they turned my stomach upside down. I provided them the opportunity to be together. What's wrong? I can't sleep. There are so many things on my mind now. Go to sleep. Are you going back to her again? —What now? —I didn't use a condom. Don't worry. I just had my period a couple of days ago. No wonder it felt particularly good. It feels so snug; it feels so good. You must use a condom when you do it with the others. Don't be silly. You'll be the only one. All men fool around; it's only a matter of how many. If there's a pill that can reduce your hormone levels, that'd be great. Will it make me impotent? That's even better so you can stay with me forever. Go to sleep. We'll do it again tomorrow morning. Stop dreaming! Don't you want to? Just now, you... Don't say anymore... Go to sleep... Her name is Vivian too? It's my idea but it has nothing to do with you. Why are you still here? It's late. I forgot something here. She's very popular after the commercial is aired. You're a good manager. I worked really hard this time. Even if I get fired, I'd still have a backup. I can work for other companies. Are you always this mean or you just have something against me? Both. Do you really dislike me that much? —Do you know you've a nickname? —What? Super cold-blooded lady killer... Yes, your face is always sullen like now. Let me teach you another English word. R-e-l-a-x. Do you know how to pronounce it? Relax... Thank you! I've made the money for you. Shouldn't you buy me dinner? Let's go to that same restaurant as the last time. Go Dutch. Go Dutch? OK! Will we be drinking? No, wait. Give me your address first. In case I send you to the wrong place again. I wasn't myself the last time. This time, it's my turn to look at your toes. I've athlete's foot. Hello? Why are you still calling me? I'm not free now. OK. Sorry, I've something... No excuse! I'm just joking! Next time then. It's on me the next time. Bye. Bye. Why am I always so unlucky? I will eat by myself! I'd wanted to get her drunk, rip off her skirt... get on top of her, turn her around and... Relax! I'll remember. I'm not going to open the door for you! Bring your girl back to your own place. It's me, Yu. —Hi! —Why are you here so late? I just got off work and feel like taking a shower. There's no water at the hotel? I don't know why but the water pressure at the hotel is very low these few days. It feels better to bathe at your place. You're finally listening to me and reading women magazines. This isn't mine; it's my dad's. You're really bad at lying. Hurry up and go take your shower. You've only five minutes. All right! Shower... Crazy woman... How dare you dress like this at night? If you bump into a pervert, you're done for! He'll drag you to a deserted street and rape you. —What is it? —A rat! —Where is it? —Over there. It's a very big one! —It's really big? —Yes, it went past the window. —It just ran across? Phew. —It might come back! How am I going to take my shower now? Don't shower for one night. I'll shower once a week occasionally. —But I stink! Smell it. —OK. Why don't you shower with me? Shower with you? It feels good. It's great... Hurry up, are you done? Are you in a hurry? What do you think, having to sit like this? Read the magazine and you won't be bored. How to achieve orgasm Hey! What article are you reading? Read it to me. How to achieve... high... salary! I don't want to hear this one. What's next? Read it! "Give him a hundred percent..." —"Challenge" —What? Why are the contents of this issue so odd? Exactly. This magazine is useless. What a waste of money. Let me see. "Where is the best place to do something..." "to get the best feeling." On the bed, one star. On the floor, two stars. On the sofa, three stars. Inside the car, four stars! In the bath tub... Guess how many stars is that? Can you guess? No need for stars! Help! Help? You turn me on! —Help me put out the fire! —No... At last, I still can't control it and slept with her. Will she think I'm an easy person? Just now... Do you like it? What? You don't like it? No, I do. I... It's my first time. Is she kidding? I think so too. But I used to ride bicycles so... I feel I lost something. Fine, if you say so, I've got nothing to say. I believe you. I hope that you'd the first man in my life... and also my last. That's getting me to take on this responsibility forever? Don't worry. Again? Let's just kiss... I need time to recharge. Time to eat! All right! The phone is ringing. Answer it for me. —Hello? —Is Patrick here? He's in the bathroom. Who's that calling? So fast? Did you buy them from downstairs? —I cooked all these. —What soup is this? Cabbage soup. Mabel just called you. She reminds you to go to Club 97 tonight. Which Mabel? I don't really know her. Ignore her. Just go and you'll remember. Don't be silly. I promised to watch DVDs with you throughout the night. You just took a dump? Do you know where I can find a Chinese physician for rheumatism? Are you serious? You don't have to go that far with a virgin. I can't help it. She wants me to shower with her every night. What can I do? You're something. I've never tried a virgin before. You look tired too. Maybe I haven't been out for one-night stands lately. You became a good boy after being together with Mei. No. I slept with another girl two nights ago. But I couldn't perform. Is it that bad? Yes! Every time I wear a condom, I can't perform. Side effects, maybe? I don't use it with Mei so whenever I use one outside, I can't perform. You're fine when you do it with Mei. Yes. Did Mei give you soup or some medicine recently? Yes, both. She has put a curse on you! No way. What curse? Money curse, love curse, faithful curse... sex curse! It's not curable. Sex curse? The crew got off this early? Don't they have to work tonight? Something is wrong with the set. I told them to continue tomorrow. Do you need help? I studied fine art for a semester in university. Really? —Why didn't you continue? —I didn't like the professor. I punched him. He wanted to sleep with me. That's not surprising. I meant you should beat him up. How do you want it? Whatever. Don't be too deliberate; just be natural. Be natural. Of all the men I know, you're the most... —The most what? —The most... The most nothing. Right? Is that good or bad? There's nothing wrong with that. You'll be more easily contented. Give me your address first. I'm not planning to go home tonight. Someone is waiting for me there. I don't want to see him. You owe somebody money? Just kidding. Are you troubled by such things as well? What do you think of me? Tell me. Of all the women I know, you're the most unfeminine woman. What do you mean? You don't like men but women. I don't understand. You're a lesbian. Lesbian? You said I'm a lesbian? —Aren't you? —Who told you that? —Everyone in the company said so. —You believe what they said? Fortunately they said I'm a lesbian. What if they said I've AIDs? Don't worry. That would be Patrick. You've always thought that I'm a lesbian, and that's why you're biased against me? —No! —You are! I can tell you're biased against me the first time we met. Am I right? Don't put words in my mouth. You think I'm a lesbian, that's why you're afraid of seeing me. You're afraid to talk to me. So you only dared touch my toes, right? I'm afraid, but not of you. What are you afraid of then? What happens if I can't control myself? Don't control it then. Dad. What? Look at number six. He's so good. Have you tried it with two girls together? —You mean on the same bed? —Of course not. I mean liking two girls at the same time. Of course! It's no big deal. Did Mum know? I don't know. Maybe she did but she pretended not to know. What? She didn't mind sharing you with another woman? Another woman? Didn't you say two? —Two? —Yes. Two and not including Mum? No, not including her. Did they dump you or you dumped them? It's not about dumping. In situations like that, you must take one step at a time. It will slowly disappear. How? It's a rule that... you can't play with two balls in a football game. Understand? Two balls? You're so stupid! I don't want you to watch soccer with me anymore. By the way, the mobile phone you bought for me is spoilt. —Take it and fix it for me. —OK. Two balls... they will disappear... I came back to pick up some clothes. You didn't leave anything behind, did you? You can throw away whatever that are left behind. See that bag of items on the chair? Please give it back to Patrick. They are pictures and birthday cards. Actually, you can throw them away too. I left the keys on the table. The lock is broken. You should get a new one. Better to be safe than sorry. There's no need for that. The lease is ending soon. We've been looking around. We're going to buy an apartment. No hurry. Look around slowly. He's very fickle. You like flowers? He has a sensitive nose. By the way... he still has a suit at the dry cleaner. Please collect it for him. Don't worry. I'll take care of it. Don't waste time on him. He's not going to change. I haven't thought of changing him. The important thing is we're happy together. At the beginning, I thought the same. But you know there's not going to be a happy ending... so no point lying to yourself. Mei Mei. Mei Mei is on leave. When does her leave period start? I don't know. She took two weeks' leave to go on a trip. A trip? Your place or mine? Well, it's up to you. But I don't want to use a condom. No condom? Safe sex, man. I'm OK! Look, I'm clean! You're clean? Is this your first time here? —Come on. —Forget it... I've told you many times. I don't want any of the train, rocket, pencil crap. There's nothing new. Do it again. Let's have lunch together. Where? What time? One o'clock sharp. My office. —I've already taken my shower. —Just shower again, join me... —Don't waste water... —Just sit there. I'm afraid of rats! I've a lot of things to do. —Do it while we're in the shower. —What? This is bad for my health. Do you sell Viagra? I'll take all the stock you have. Make it quick and give me a discount. Benny. Here's your change. I'll give you a call when there are new arrivals. Sir, how can I help you? Do you have Panadol? I don't suppose you have it. Never mind, thanks. I do. You want to buy Viagra, don't you? Those who usually come in here with sunglasses do. Well, it's my uncle. He's... I get it. All my customers say that. Night Club Miss, it hurts! You don't have to be so rough, do you? You're not feeling well? Let me take a rest first. I'll pay you more, OK? Let me put some oil on you. It helps. I've already taken some medicine. Let me check your pulse. Were you a nurse before? My family have been Chinese physicians for three generations. Sorry, I didn't know that. Raise your head. Show me your tongue. Stick it out more... That's right. Raise both your arms. Both arms. Do you know what you're doing? Sit up straight. Does it hurt? Poor thing. What is it? There's a problem with your kidneys. Nonsense! I'm young and strong. Kidney problems? Stop kidding me. Bill, please. I want to get married. —What? —I didn't say anything. It's me. I said I'm getting married. Dad, are you drunk? I feel very lonely recently... so I want to find a companion. You should tell me that earlier, Simon. I'll get you an inflatable doll. I'm not talking about sex... although it's normal for the elderly to have a sex life too. Why do you want to get married suddenly? Who's going to marry you? Chan from the fruit stall downstairs. The fruit-seller, Chan? I've never met her before. How's she like? It doesn't matter. Our wedding will be held next month. I'll introduce you to her then. Are you serious? Women like wedding dinners. It doesn't cost much anyway. What a man needs is a family. You guys are still young, you won't understand. I'm back! Uncle is here? Hello! Did you miss me? Of course. Isn't she the one you took upstairs the other day? Look, Simon. You won't understand the matters of young men like us. I really don't understand. How can two men share the same girl? —No, Dad, I... —Let me explain it to him. Let's go outside for a drink. Don't bother them, OK? The long distance flight was so tough! Let me fill up the water for you to bathe. Luckily Thomas was there to talk to me so I didn't get so bored. Who? Thomas. He sat next to me. He's a mature guy, very gentlemanly. He was trying to flirt with you. No! He said I look like his wife who died twenty years ago. He was just sweet-talking you. He knows a lot of things like... astronomy, geography, history... He knows everything. Guess what he does for a living? He's a pimp. No! He's in the oil business. He's very rich. He works at the gas station, I guess? It must be him! He promised to call me. Hello. Thomas? It's really you! I'm at my manager's place now. —Manager? —Yes. Let's go shower. —OK. Tomorrow. —There's a rat inside. She has a change of heart at the drop of a hat. —Moon, the flowers are for Miss Ng. —Thank you. Moon, do you have any painkillers for toothache? Go ask around the colleagues. What are you doing? These flowers are very beautiful. —Are you jealous someone is pursuing me? —Yes. He's married. Mr Wai, does this painkiller work? I'll talk to you later. Moon, throw away the flowers for me. Boss, will you see Mei later? Why? She asked me to scan a photo but I'm going on a trip tomorrow. —Give it to me. —Thanks, Boss. You always took my sandwiches... and lied that you were going to take me to Disneyland. You said there were sharks and girls shouldn't go there. Hello? Why didn't you tell me about going on long leave? Where did you go these past two weeks? Water, please. I'd to go to America to attend to something urgent. You could've called me. Have you ever thought about what you like about me? Well, I... You've a good figure. You're nice, you treat me well and care about me. You... Didn't Fun treat you well? The two of you aren't the same. What happened? Patrick, don't you understand? The relationship between two people isn't only for one night; it's for the whole life. It's not as easy as you think. I know. I know in the past... I was wrong but going forward, I'll... I married my cousin in America. He'd proposed to me many times. I'd thought about it seriously. I'm sure he can give me happiness. Hello? Yes... All right. OK. Bye. —Is that him? —Yes. Congratulations. Thanks. Honey? I'm coming back now. Our daughter is asleep? OK. Cousin, I can go home by myself. Thank you so much. Are you OK? —Fine, I'll call you again. Bye. —Bye. Mei Mei... Mei Mei... That guy... I don't care who he is. I'm sure you didn't marry him. Why did you lie to me? Tell me. Let me go. I don't want to fight with you. —Why did you lie to me? Tell me! —I don't want to be the second Fun. I told you I'd change. Change? How? Will you be happy if you change? You can't sleep with another girl when we're together. Can you do that? But I cannot live without you. Why not? You survived without me for the past two weeks. Fun was with you for five years. Without her, you survived. Don't be so selfish. I really want to be your friend again. I love the feeling we had in the past. I went to America alone. I went to Disneyland... but I realised it wasn't that great. Life is full of contradictions. I had made up my mind before I came back to see you. The May-December romance of new commercial star and rich oil tycoon Don't come since it's already so late! What's there to bathe? Go bathe with petrol! You didn't even bring the keys. Is Mr Cheung Sook Wai there? Yes, I'm him. Hello. My surname is Mud. I'm from ICN Management. Management company? —It's expensive to sign me on. —No. I want to sign Miss Vivian Choi under our management company. —You want to steal my girl? —Well, don't say that. We can work together. We just want her to do well. Do you still need to do all these? Well, you've to do it according to tradition. Stop for a moment... I'm very tired. What's wrong? Look at you. Only a couple of steps and you're short of breath. A couple of steps? We'd walked a couple of blocks! Why don't you try carrying them yourself? You're so weak. How can you go after girls? No wonder not one of your relationships lasted long. I'm getting married before you do. Don't be so arrogant. You don't have much time left anyway. What are you looking at? These are children's clothes. Let's go. I'll buy them for my unborn baby. What? You're going to get married because you got her pregnant? I'm still a strong man, no less. You've already given her money. You don't need to give her these gifts. It's all because of you I'd to marry your mum back then. Now, my job is to make babies... and you'll be responsible to raise them for me. Do you know how hard it was for me to raise you? A boy is better than a girl, for she may get cheated by men. The adultery couple? Dad, I've something urgent to do. Carry them yourself. Bye. —Where are you going? —Going after a girl! You're suddenly so fit now! You've missed it. Just stop here will do. Why didn't you return my call yesterday? Do I have to answer you? Can you give me some respect? I've said I won't divorce her. I'm sick and tired. —You knew it right from the beginning. —But things can change, can't they? Do you have another man? Go. I'll go back by myself. Don't look for me anymore. What a coincidence! What are you doing here? Yes, what am I doing here? You followed me? What did you see? I saw birds flying past and the sun rising. Then I turned around and saw you. I don't look like a third party, do I? It isn't so much about whether a person looks like one. If you're the third party, I'm the fourth. Relationships aren't easy; it's not something you can control. Have you heard the bus story before? —What? —Let me think first. You're waiting for a bus. The first bus was too crowded. You couldn't get in. So you waited. The next one came but it was too old so you waited for the next one. The third bus came but it had no air conditioning. It was too hot so you didn't get on it either. Then the fourth bus came... Whatever is in the middle is not important. The most important thing is you'd rather walk than get on a wrong bus. What are you trying to say? I don't know either. But I think it's fine even if you got on the wrong bus; it's your choice. I told him I picked you. Does that mean I got on the wrong bus? —Wait. —What? I want to drink some wine. —You don't want me anymore? —I... No. Then why did you get another company to send me to Japan for a year? I want you to pick up more things in Japan so you can make more money. I don't want money! I don't want to go anywhere. I just want to be with you. You promised me that you'd never leave me. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have trusted you. Yu... Vivian, can you get me some plasters and lotion? I'd stepped on broken glass. I'm a third party, not a maid. Go get it yourself. So there's a fifth party. What a surprise! Out! The most painful experience in life is not the bleeding. It's the mess that has to be dealt with after the bleeding. We don't know how to deal with the mess because we're hoping for the best. But as things develop, it got worse. Perhaps we walked too fast... faster than what our brain could handle and as such, we were slow in response. It was so fast that we didn't have the courage to turn back and start again. Accidents occur. Life is fragile. In order to alleviate the pain caused by accidents... we've only one choice. Buy BIB insurance to protect your life. Thank you. Is it your last day today? Hey! I've so many loose ends to tie up. No wonder you weren't there at my "show." Talking about that... when you're doing your shows, you look really sincere. What do you mean? So you think I'm not sincere now? I don't know. The feeling is not the same. Is Yu really going to Japan? I think so. Why didn't Wai stop her from leaving? I want to stop you from leaving too. The key is am I able to do so? We've agreed not to discuss this again. I promised myself not to cry today. You won't cry? We used to call you Crying Queen back then... Go to hell! It hurts! You know it hurts now? You're always hurting others. If you've no one to marry you eventually, don't come back to me! Save your breath! If you're not going to chase after Yu, she'll fly to Japan and you'll be dumped. I think Vivian suits you more. She's taller than you and makes more money than you. She has everything better than you. It looks like you're going to run away from the problem again. You're very good at running away. —You think... —Shut up! Don't cry. Go upstairs and do your homework. What are you doing? Where are you going? On a... t-t-trip. To where? I don't know yet. You haven't been to work for a week, for a good seven days! God only used seven days to create this world. And you can't even come up with a place to go to in seven days? I'll decide when I get to the airport. So do you decide what bus to take when you're on the street? Do you go to the restaurant first before knowing what to eat? And to church before deciding whom to marry? Yes to all that, except marriage. If I want to marry you... are you going to take seven years to decide? I'll give you seven seconds to think about it. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. —Six. —Sorry. I don't think I'm the right bus for you. I said "if." I came to tell you I didn't get on the wrong bus. It's a pity the bus is too slow and I'm in a hurry. I'll never forget Vivian... because she's the first woman I've ever dumped. But actually getting dumped and dumping others is the same. The feelings are like eating chili and wasabi. Both will make you cry. Let's continue to listen to... the interview of the new commercial star, Yu, recorded a few days ago. Yu, we all know you're leaving Hong Kong for Japan soon. —Mister, can you turn it up please? —Are you going to miss anyone? There's a person... who has changed my whole life. Actually, there's nothing really much to talk about him... because I've to learn to forget him. Hello? She has checked out? I'm sorry. I can't go to Japan. Hello? Are you looking for me? Under such circumstances, how could you say no if you were me? Yes. I can't live without you. Marry me. We'll be together forever. Wait. Something is not right. After so many heart-breaking experiences... I wouldn't be so rash to make such a resolute promise. It's better to tell her something more abstract. Are you looking for me? Yes. I'm worried about you going to Japan alone... so I intend to go with you. Although we don't know what will happen in the future... I'll always love you. Look, she's just as happy to hear that. So, you can't be a big mouth when it comes to promises in love. If you make a little mistake, it will impact your entire life. Yu didn't become my wife... but she did become the most famous queen of commercial in Japan. She drives the Japanese men crazy. Although we seldom see each other... we'll occasionally enjoy a shower together. After Patrick broke up with Mei... he kept on fooling around. But he passed out one night. He laid on the street for three hours and no one noticed. Eventually, a garbage collector called an ambulance to take him to the hospital. There were indeed some problems with his kidneys; he had kidney stones. He's a changed man after the bout of illness. He got married and gave birth to a baby. He found a hot-tempered Taiwanese girl, who looks like Fun's twin. Her name is Fong. I guess that's his retribution. I told you to wait for me here! Why can't you just wait a little while? —Sorry... —Take these! Move faster! You're so slow! You're useless! But whenever he hugs his girl... I mean his daughter... he looks so satisfied. Mei, that kind-hearted angel keeps on giving her love to the world... but not to men. She opened a toy shop for children. This rich entrepreneurial lady... is still waiting for her Mickey Mouse to appear. As for Vivian... well, you've seen it. I don't know if she was seriously hurt after being dumped by me... but she disappeared for two years. She went to the US... and opened an art gallery called "Relax" in Soho, New York. She became a modern oil painting artist. Her paintings are very expensive. But no matter how I look at them... I really think her paintings are just so-so. —I got it, honey. —Hurry up! Yes, I'll pick you up after watching soccer. I said pick, not kick. Would I dare kick you? Daddy, let's go play football at the garden. How many times have I told you? I'm your brother. He's your father and mine too. Whatever. Anything goes. Since you feed him, you can be his father too. Anyway, we're family. That's Yu in her new commercial. She's such a hit in Japan; she must be making more money than you do. Is there anything wrong? Will the police arrest me for that? —Sure. —Kiddo, remember her face. Call her Mum when you see her. You'll stand to benefit. Hello? (French) Have you gotten to know a French girlfriend? It's none of your business. The game has started. Let's see if France wins. Dad, I think I like snooker more than football. Can you handle so many balls at the same time? Good job! So... life is like a soccer match; you'll be a hero if you can block it.
