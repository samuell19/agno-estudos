To the Stars by Hard Ways. Second engine slow down. Speed 5 meters. - Got it. -Third sector; Are you ready? -We need two more minutes. It's a strange ship. Look it up in the Somov's atlas. It's not listed. I don't understand. What's up with Lebedev? -Sergei; they're waiting for you in the third sector. Are you ready? -Coming Remember, the ship is broken. You'll have to work in vacuum. Good luck. We're moving through the hallway. Can you see us? See you fairly well. What's there? Just dust floating here. The equipment compartments are damaged significantly. We could use some additional light here. Can you determine the time of catastrophe? At least a few months ago. I'm taking the samples. This was a laboratory. Sergei; you're a contact specialist. Does it remind you of anything? I don't see any analogies so far. Many damages... Narrow corridor... Wow. People there. DNA testing. -Who are they? Humanoids? Looks like embryos. DNA differs from ours by 40 percent. They are not earthlings It's a like museum of physiological anomalies. It looks like a cloning laboratory. -What makes you think so? -They're all identical. Damn it. They're all identical? -Attention. Is it spacesuit?- Yes, but it is not like standard model. It has no deformations and damages. Sergei; why did you fall silent? You're not watching your son? He'll forgive me. I don't have a single free minute. All my sperm whales have gone mad. and besides, from a biological point of view it holds no fascination at all. Grandpa, you're a conservative- she's from up there. We're dealing with a alien kind of mindset. The very principal of growing humans in vitro must serve some secret goal. For all we know she may be a source of danger for all humanity. What do you suggest? We'll quarantine this creature in our institute of Cosmic Bio Robo Technics, and will conduct thorough tests. Tests of it's brain first of all. When we'll understand everything- then we'll talk about contacts. I disagree with Nadezhda Ivanova. Contact is a two-way street. I don't argue, but it seems that you've forgotten about our responsibility. No, I didn't. But I also didn't forget about our responsibility toward her. Nadezhda. Sergei. I don't understand the point of your argument. It's pretty obvious that we're dealing not with a robot but a human being. And a pretty girl at that. Something's odd. That poor child has force of a robot. I'm asking the Council to let her stay at my house. What if she was created to kill? Any contact with an alien mind implies some degree of risk. And sooner or later this risk has to be taken. In your institute she'll be completely isolated. And this is bad. Let not only us understand her, but also her understand us. A human being must have a house. It needs to be proved that she's a human. Let her become a human. I repeat, I'm asking the Council to consider my proposition. Okay; but how are you going to provide bio-control in your house? Maybe you could help with it? Yes of course, but... That's all for today. Members of the Contacts Council Please stay a while longer. You forgot completely... I didn't forget anything, Mother. You haven't changed a bit; You're still not overly affectionate. Come here. This is your house, and this is your family. Hello. She's new here and we're looking at her as if she is a hippo. It's not very nice. Mother. The mysterious beauty may bite? Stepa; shame on you. -Father, she's never seen the grass. -Maybe. Come; come here. Don't be afraid. Come in. You're just as selfish as your father. You've been gone for a year. Now you're back. But I don't believe that you're back. Because all you can think of is this creature; It's more important to you than me. It's more important that Stepan, it's... -You're wrong, Mother. I missed you all a lot. You, Stepan, Tanya... All of you. But I have my job. It's my job, understand? -Did Dad bring this shell from Java? -I brought this shell. You didn't let me finish. What was I talking about? About my job. No, I was talking about Stepan. You completely forgot that you have a son. You bring him these idiotic stones, you see him once a year He's going through changes; He has to go to space, but he's rude to his teachers. I went through those changes a long time ago. -You simply didn't notice it, Grandma. -Did you hear that? She'll live here at Tanya's. A technician will be here tonight. And he'll install a forcefield on the window. You see Sergei? You're turning our house into a test site. Excuse me, but I have to take some elementary safety measures. You're afraid of her. She may be afraid. She' very lonely. If we don't become close with her, she may die. You see, Sergei, In the end you'll leave for your next expedition and I'll have to take care of everything myself. Like that time when you brought that predator the one that was sneezing all the time. -What was its name? -Legocephal Son'ka. And I had to treat cuts on Stepan's hands. Mother, you're a doctor. Moreover, you're a gynaecologist. You've always dealt with children. With human children. This is Nadezhda. Peace to you. Everybody have a fine day. -Hello. Can I have a ride? -Go ahead. Hello, Maria Pavlovna. I read your latest article- it's very fascinating. Thank you. How are you? -Any complaints about you? -No, I'm trying not to let you down. Thank you, it's very important to me. My new hobby; Collecting autographs. Can I have one, please? You're not consistent. -Are you here on business? -Of course. -Please. Oh, there she is. I wouldn't leave her without supervision, if I were you. Where are you going to keep her? Keep? She'll live in Tanya's room until Tanya gets back. -Upstairs on the right. -What are you going look at up there? Maria Pavlovna, the Contacts Council charged me with keeping biocontrol of this creature. Trust me, it's not just curiosity. Nadezda's right. It was a Council decision. Don't be angry with Mother. She was waiting for me, and here came this girl... And then me. Is it so hard to forgive what happened 20 years ago. -That wall is new? -How did you guess? -I remember everything. Is it a concrete wall? -No. These days it's plastosteel. It will have to be removed. What do you mean "removed"? It will interfere with biocontrol. -It will have to be removed. -Very well. Sergei, I'm protesting. Mother, it's necessary. You're a scientist yourself. No, now I'm not a scientist. Now I'm the keeper of this house. We'll replace it in a half an hour. You won't even notice. It's not a problem of time, It's not even a problem of the wall The problem is, Nadezhda, that you've never had children. What does this have to do with anything else? It's cruel to mention it, especially by you. My life's function is not connected with maternity, is it? -Sergei, they'll bring a new wall in a half an hour. -OK So, in this house I'm not heard anymore. Then I'm leaving. Glasha. -Mother, it's chilly outside. - I'm upset with you. How are you? -Everything alright? - We're fine. -I'm sorry I couldn't meet you. -I know you had an emergency. We spent almost three days underwater. I thought I'd grow gills. -You lost some weight. - You too. -I heard the girl will live with us? OK, you know what you're doing. -Thanks. -What's the score? -Glasha is merciless. -As always. Where is she? I don't know. Nadezhda, where is she? She's in a closet wearing a spacesuit. Nadya, why didn't you say it earlier? It would interfere with the experiment. What's wrong? You broke dishes... Come out. Listen, are you a human being or not? It's time for breakfast. And I have to go to the clinic soon. She can teleport. Try to catch her yourself. Catch her? She's not a butterfly. Come, come, come. Good girl. No, no, this is not my planet. I can't remember. I can't tell. You can do everything. You will remember everything. So strange... It's as if her memory was turned off. I remember. My Father. I remember my sisters and brothers. -Swallow- Swallow, black tale... Good girl. -Swallow-Swallow... Hi. How are you? What did you learn today? A great deal. She has amazing reflexes. How's your college going, astronaut? Excellent, except for some small problems, in a barochamber. Somebody named Selena called you. She'll be an intern here, she wants to see you. Who is she? Grandmother She was the mistake of my youth. Her parents worked on the Moon, that's why they named her so. It's a pity that your youth is over... Say it again. Take a look at the watermelon that I brought. It's a wonderful watermelon. The first one this year. Wa-ter-me-lon What is a mistake of youth? She does have quick reflexes. Catch. Why did you frighten her? It was the first one this season. Never mind the watermelon. Can you repeat that? -Can you stop this? -Stepan. Why didn't you catch it? Why? Because I asked you. I'm sorry. Did I upset you? I think that she can't do such tricks on demand. It's time to go see Nadezhda. Get ready. I'm not going there. She looks inside me. She wants to understand you, Niya. All this rubbish... Wonderful watermelon. Lot of glucose. -What's that? -Deer. Mother. Why? You have to ask Grandmother. She knows everything. All our life is an experiment. Let's go. I don't want you to go there either. Don't worry. I grew up here. I'm in my element. It is impossible to live in the water. Let's try. You only think that the water is dangerous. Sometimes I'm simply afraid of you. Did you see Stepan? He's over there. I'm Selena. You must be the girl they found. -Neeya. -It's a pretty name. Stepka. Stepan. Come out. Why are you looking like that? Do you like me? A great number of people do. Can you swim? I'll teach you. Are you afraid? Don't. In this life you should try everything. I'm an explorer myself. I was on the Moon, went down to the bottom of the ocean. What does it mean "the mistake of youth"? Oh, even so... Why are you asking? Stepan said that you were the mistake of his youth. What foolishness. I didn't pay any attention to him. -Did he say it to you? -He said it when I was there. He's a fool. Why aren't you wearing a wig? As is it's too primitive. Sergei, are you busy? Do you need me? Yes, turn the screen on. I found something new, and I had to share it with you. It fits into your theory. Look at this. This is the control centre. Explain. Whoever created Neeya wanted her to be a controlled mechanism. If this centre is activated She loses control of herself. Are you sure? I love water a lot, Air Music And beautiful people. I especially adore children. Do you like children? Or don't you know them? I know. How? You're an artificial being. I used to have sisters and brothers. In test tubes? Your inferiority is easily understood. I know your story. If you want I can help you with a lot of things. Hello, Selena. How is the Moon? Here, look at this. I'm going to get her dressed. Don't you dare do it again. I'm working, Sergei. I'm flying over right now. I'll be glad to see you. -What's wrong? -I don't know. Did you miss me? Huh? Yes, of course. No doubt, you're in love. Nonsense, she lives in our house. I'm responsible for her. Neeya, let's go. Let's go. You would make a good babysitter. The baby is a bit too old though. Leave her alone, Selena. I have nothing against her. But to keep her in the house is a mistake. I wouldn't let her near children. -What if she eats them? -Selena. Did I offend you? Never mind her. Let's go. -I don't want her to be here. -What are you... Stop. You can't harm a human. Again... This must be your first law. I can't take it anymore. The brain of each of you contains a control centre. I can always keep you from making mistakes, warn you of danger, This is your greatest advantage. But as with any other advantage it can turn into a disadvantage. This is what I'm afraid of. You had a power over another human, and you enjoyed using it. I'm sorry, Sergei. -Don't move. It makes it hard for me. -I'm trying. I'm just a robot for you. I can be controlled; that means I'm a robot. Nonsense. Who's going to control you? Nadezhda, or somebody else. Experiments with the human mind are forbidden on Earth But not with the mind of a robot. Raise your hand, make a fist. Open it... good. Both it and I can be fixed... Improved. Neeya, you are a human. If you ever want it, this centre can be removed. This centre is a part of my brain. I won't be able to live without it. I will shut off like a broken machine. We are all machines of some kind. My father can also give me an order. That's not the same. Could you have an affair with a robot? Toward you I feel like a brother. My God. What a clown you are, Stepan. I'm not a clown. Neeya, you're no worse than anybody else. Nobody's perfect. One misses a limb, the other one; their sense of humour. You have a control centre. You would make a perfect wife. -You would be priceless. -Stepan... Nobody's perfect, Grandmother. -You didn't sleep at all? -I know I'm going fail it, I know. Then you can rejoice- There's no way I'll be able to go to space. -Is it Cosmology? -Cosmic navigation. Good morning. Ah, who is it? It's me. This is not a time for masquerade. I have the last final and you.. Glasha, are you ready? I'm running late. Breakfast is ready. - I'm coming. I won't be home for lunch. My colleague, Prul, is finally going back home to Ocean. I can't wait for the moment when he leaves. Is he a big scientist at home? In his own right. He's a rather original scientist, but a scoundrel. It's totally different up there on the planet Ocean. I have to go. -Leaving? -Listen. Are you having the last final today? I'm off. One may think that you're whipped into crawling all over the Universe. You should've left the wig on. It looked good on you. I haven't seen Tatyana for a year and a half. Sergei took off for Pluto- They found some cosmic wanderers there. Stepa, stop it. After the finals, you,Stepa, will go off God knows where for an internship. Yes, yes, I will. I don't see Grandfather at all- he spends all his time underwater. -Are you going too? -I'll stay on Earth. Yes, you will. She's not a reliable partner. If the phone rings and they say "Neeya, we found your planet"... It's for you, Maria Pavlovna. I'm listening. Repeat diagnosis again. I got it, very well. They're having a difficult labour case in a camp on the plateau of South Cross. I gotta go. OK, no questions asked. Don't they have their own midwife? You should be proud That Grandmother is asked to help. I'm proud; very proud. Neeya, do you want to come with me? Very much so. I think everyone forgot that I'm leaving Earth tomorrow. You will pass your final and wait for us. We'll be home in the evening. Are you tired? No. Grandmother did everything. She performed a miracle. That's her job. -What are you digging here? -An ancient town. The one that was here before. Why? Our ancestors lived here. If it wasn't for them, we would not be here either. They died long time ago, there's nothing left now but stones. Stones can speak too. We need to save the memory of those who died. Why would you save the dead ones? Everything's connected together. We dug this stone out last year. It's poems. The author lived a thousand years ago but he had the same problems and thoughts as we do today. We're not here forever, just in passing Even jade is born, even the feathers of Ketsal get torn, We're not here forever, just in passing just passing... And over there was a well for sacrifice. They really used to sacrifice people here? Yes, young men and women. During the excavation there was a lot of jewellery found. Let's go and see. It was a very cruel world. One's destiny was determined at the point of birth. The all powerful priests made human sacrifices. to get favours from gods, It's very deep. Excuse me. I have to leave you. You are the last hope of Dessa. If you don't succeed with your mission Our world is bound to die. Sense of duty, Sense of loyalty to our goal- That's our lot. Forget about joy, forget about yourself as I did. I sacrifice you for Dessa. I love you. But I have to take away from you your right for happiness. -Good evening. -Good evening. Please, come and sit. These are my friends. Please, meet them. ...Today the mission members visited a city resort and the Institute of Marine Biology... And now the representative of the planet Dessa. We came here with the help of a Galactic scout patrol. The main reason of our visit is to study Earth men's experience in saving planets for the sake ...of our dying world. -Who are they? -Some mission... - From planet Dessa... -Why are they here? Is something bothering you? Phone call. I need to be home immediately. Professor Lebedeva is still sleeping. She was very tired. Let her sleep. Please, help me to get back. Astra- Dessa- Ocean. Were you very late? Are you going to get in trouble? -Where is your stuff, cadet? -I have everything with me. Take your everything and go to Astra. Remember? Astra. We go to the stars. But the hard way. That's all. Barmalei. -Problems? -Everything's fine. I got transferred to a different ship. Watch out. Where do you think you're going? Go to the cargo dock. This is not a cargo but a passenger. I'm a well respected passenger, and if I have a different number of limbs it doesn't give you the right to despise me. I agree. Please, be careful. This is a member of Academy Prul, a scientific business on Earth. He's my colleague. It's too late. The offence is taken. Please, forgive us. We apologize. Keep an eye on him. Professor Klimov is aware of the situation. Dear colleague I wish you a happy journey. All the cosmograms were sent to your wonderful planet Ocean. Your compatriots are looking forward to your arrival. I gotta go. Cadet. Follow him. How long are you on this ship? 16 years, cadet. -Is this a scout ship? -Yes, it was in the past. -And now? It's an astro septic ship. -Septic ship? -Astro septic ship. Is something bothering you? I thought it was a scouting ship. Oh, I understand. You're disappointed. Don't be upset. We're angels of space. And don't be late for your ship next time. Let's take off. -The ship is ready for take-off. -Thanks. Cadet Lebedev, your internship will start with this task. You will take care of professors's colleague Prul, until Colleague Prul gets home. -Where will I live? -Here. -You bunk is there. -What will I have to do? To feed, to clean, to wake up at night. Colleague Prul will tell you. First of all, turn the heater on, I'm freezing. Young people today, They forget that taking care of me makes them better. I already caught a cold. Who's there? I don't get it. It's time for a check up. Excuse me, is this a medical sector... Stepan? What are you doing here? Hello. This is my internship. Dear god. I cradled this young man in my hands. -Cadet Lebedev. -Viktor Klimov, nice meeting you. How are things at home? I haven't visited in ages. Everything's fine. Neeya is fine as well. So, what do you need medics for? I was told to take care of the octopus. Ah, colleague Prul. He's caught a cold? What do I do? -What are the symptoms? -Symptoms? I don't even know how to take his temperature. Edik, check block #32. I'll go to the second sector. So far there's nothing to worry about Everything is within reasonable limits. I know your limits. I demand to be checked again after take-off. We'll do it without a doubt. Stepan, step out with me for a moment. You're hiding something from me. -Don't. The cruel truth is better than uncertainty. -I swear, that your health is normal. The more you fuss with him, the more demanding he'll be. But is his health really normal? Absolutely. Be polite and patient with him. He's our guest and he's lonely. Have you ever had to deal with aliens? -I had a chance. -It's going to be fine. Prul is calling you. -Get the predator away from me, he'll eat me. -Shoo, Vasiliy, how did you get here? Get out of here. I demand an official apology for the attack on a representative from a different planet. Vasiliy wouldn't eat somebody with intellect. On the other hand, you're right. Cadet Lebedev; who is responsible for the mischief, will be punished. Why didn't you lock the door? It was locked. And then, how do I know that you have a cat on a spaceship? Cadet Lebedev. This is not a cat. This is a crew member -Vasiliy. Vasiliy, Vasya. Attention, everybody get ready for take-off. Sit in your take-off chairs. I begin the countdown. We take-off on the count of 100. Stepan, seal off the container. Make sure it's tight. We passed the outer signals. Everything's fine. Check our position to Ganimed. Checked. What about the Spiri Comet? Are we going to cut it's tail off? 'Cause our meteorite defence isn't working too well. -Anything serious? -Nothing serious. -Good luck. -Thank you. Attention passengers and crew members. Spaceship Astra has left the Solar System. Take-off acceleration is over. You can leave your chairs. Hello. - Hello. My name is Neeya. Nice meeting you. I'm Edik. -I crept unseen onto your ship. -I guessed that much. I don't know how and I don't know why you did it. I need to get to Dessa. It's a strange wish. Why did you have to creep in? I found out that I had to go right before take-off. So, what happened right before take-off? I found out that I had to go to Dessa. Professor Ivanova can tell you everything about me. Professor Ivanova Please come to the commanding post.. I was found a year ago on the abandoned spaceship. Hello, Nadezhda. Did you call me? Do you know her? Yes. What a coincidence. Do you know that Stepan's here? I do. That's our new cadet? It's her...brother. -So, it was him who helped you to sneak in. Call him. -No He doesn't know anything. Then why are you here? I was born on Dessa... What's wrong with her? You remembered something. I found it out by accident when I saw the Ambassadors. What did they tell you? Nothing. Did you say them who you are? - No You can become a toy of the evil forces. Why? Because I'm an artificial being. Neither me nor her know what I was made for. I'll try not to be a threat towards you. You can't be responsible for yourself. Maybe you're right. Come down to my compartment. I didn't understand anything. That's enough fish. During a storm I like to go to the bottom of the ocean and think. Don't be greedy. At night, when the moon is bright I like to go to the ocean surface, look at the stars, and think about the multitudes of inhabited worlds. Let me taste it. More. It's tasty. As a thinker I went ahead of time. Don't open that. The predator's there. Cats don't knock. I warned you. Look, he stole a piece of chewing gum. Why? Dessa is my planet. Something is about to happen. There is an unidentified cosmic object ahead of us. It's a ship. Send our signal and ask for an answer. Silence. Maybe it's an automatic station? No, it's a ship. Why don't they respond? Look it up in Somov's atlas. I found it. It was found and searched by the crew of the space ship "Pushkin" on April 2, 2221. It was destroyed as the result of explosion. The origin of which was never discovered. On board one artificial humanoid being was found. Collected data is being processed. A year ago, "Pushkin". Professor Ivanova, Neeya, representatives of the planet Dessa I apologize for interrupting your sleep. I'm asking you all to get to the commanding post right now. -Do you recognize this ship? -Yes. Your presence is necessary. I'm sorry to bother you. Do you recognize this ship? This is "Gaya". The last ship to leave our planet. Fate caught up with Glan. Who is Glan? Glan is my father. I need to get there. The ship is dead. It doesn't make any sense. Everything makes sense. She teleported there. She's on the ship. Stepan, stop. If she's there... She's dead. It's a vacuum. -What shall we do? -Let him out. I'm free. What? So, you woke up. How are you feeling? It's a pity we didn't get along on Earth. I feel weak. It's not surprising. During your time in vacuum your body literally gobbled up all its resources. You've got visitors already. -Can I go now? It's better if you stay here. You'll be taking me apart? Yes, we will. -No. -Pardon me? Ambassador Rakan came by a few times while you were sleeping. He wants to talk to you. Yes, we need to talk. So, what happened to the ship? I was wearing a spacesuit. We finally decided to fix the outer antenna. I didn't have a chance to leave a ship. There was a loud bang. I don't remember much. Do you remember life on Dessa? Did something hit the ship? There was an explosion. That much we could determine when we found it. What set off the explosion? We're not sure yet. Yesterday we collected additional samples And we'll be able to find the answer. Did Professor Glan have enemies? Yes, that's why he ended up on the ship. These enemies... Do you think they can interrupt our work? We have people that think that we shouldn't change our life, because then we'll lose what's left. We have nothing left. Did my father want to change things? He didn't believe that Dessa people can do that themselves. That's why he created you. Many people were not happy with his experiments. They were afraid. The Institute was closed, Glan ran away. Where was he running to? He was waiting for a signal to come back. when his friends came to power. They did, but... Are you against the cleaning up of the planet? No. But I'm afraid of the revenge of those that'll lose their power and riches as a result. And the wrath of those that will lose their food, even if it's synthesized. People prefer what they know and are afraid of changes. Are we tiring you? Excuse us. Attention all sectors. Astra is changing it's course. Planet Selesta is on the brink of a catastrophe. Our Astra is closer to it than any other ship. -How much will this delay our trip? -We'll know any minute now. Astra is on it's way to save our planet. Any delay could be fatal for us. I'm in a rush as well, but I'm silent. Edik, play the last cosmogram. Nuclear reaction has started in the radioactive waste storage area. We need help, we need help. For hundreds of years they were dumping nuclear waste in deep mines. -You can't clean their mines now. We'll do what we can. I couldn't just walk by. It's not only my job, but also my duty. Planet Selesta is in plain view, Captain. Still no response. Only silence. Astra. Astra. Answer to Centre. -Astra's here. Yumata, we're late. -I know, Oleg. There were Katya and Andrey on this planet. We're sending the emergency team. I don't think anybody survived, but anything is possible. I'm asking you to stay there a bit longer. I'll try not to hold you for too long. OK, I'm waiting. Incomprehensible. -Horrible.-I understand you. Unfortunately, the order in the universe is impossible to understand. As soon as you mend one hole, another one opens up right next to it. Tomorrow something will tear up here... And you suggest to passively wait? Maybe the natural flow of things is more reasonable... -To obey Nature... -Then we would stop being humans. - You're acting defeated.-It's unavoidable. Our Galaxy, the entire Space is the arena of a fight. Without it there is no movement. If we didn't lose sometimes We couldn't regroup and learn how to win the next time. Where is the limit, the goal? Triumph of intellect. Triumph of a spaceman over forces of evil. They're all just big words. Behind which you're trying to hide changing the world to your liking. They aren't coming come on their own. We asked them to help. The ones you're defending profit from the misery of Dessa. I'm not defending anybody. Oleg, get a hold of yourself. Get over this. Astra; answer to Centre. I'm here Yamata. Oleg, we sent the emergency team. -Get back on your course. Stepan, take me back. These sights and this discussion has upset me. Neeya, did you see that criminal mindlessness? People lived there. Destination- planet Ocean. Stepan, open the doors, turn on the music, pour the drinks. Chewing gum is only for women. We're almost out of gum. Cat Vasiliy stole them. Let's say farewell. I had a good trip. I like Earth and Earthlings. Let's toast. I have one last request. Could Neeya see me off all the way down? My colleagues will be pleased to see that I'm surrounded by the representatives of different planets. -OK. I'll grant your request and will see you off. Stepan, seal me off. Your colleagues are waiting for you already. Why are you so slow? Hurry up, hurry up. Don't forget my presents. Farewell. All the best. I'm sorry to interrupt your thoughts. You're coming back to Dessa, to your home planet. But nobody's waiting for you there. You have only one friend on the entire planet. Who? Me. I was a friend of your father. I remember it. You said you forgot everything. Sometimes I can remember things. I remember how you saw us off. Yes, I helped you to escape. It was close to impossible. They wanted to take you away and kill you. Let them consider you monsters, Ambassadors of death. This is not so. You are the ambassadors of life. You are the people of the future. We are running away now but we will come back here. There will be many of us. And we will clean this world of impurity. Believe my words. Everything is in order. A ship is waiting for you. Sikki Torky knows that I'm Glan's daughter. He promised to keep silent. Nadya. -Did you take samples from "Gaya"? -What for? -And Neeya? -She has no use for them either. Why? She really doesn't. Why would they take such risks? It was important to somebody that the mystery of the explosion would remain unsolved. You're right. But let's keep it between us for now. Get ready for work. We're nearing the orbit. Complete degradation of the soil. They vacated equatorial regions. It seems that the entire population is gathered in one place. I wonder how they live. Are probes ready? Edik, you're already 19 seconds late, 20... Why? The first one is off. Now the second one is off. Energy balance is completely off. It's irreversible. Calculate on the Merkulov scale how much of the mineral resources are used. -Stepan, try to do it. -Merkulov scale? The genofund and ozone layer is dying as well. Atmosphere is heated so much, that soon they'll have to move to the poles. -94.7 on the Merculov scale. -Good work Stepan. Excuse me. How is Astra going to save us? All by itself? We are not angels, not all-powerful. We'll diagnose the situation. Determine the methods of cleaning, after that it's everybody's business. Ours and yours. Which methods? Depending on the situation: Energetic, biological, biochemical. You told us too little about your planet. Now we're conducting a complete analysis. It's very interesting. I used to work in a chemical plant for about a year. But I ran away. It was certain death. Unfortunately, I didn't have a rich father. I had to get everything with my own hands. Unlike Sikki Rakan and his friends. They had everything even before they were born. Place with clean air. Clean food. I thought it was you who questioned our mission. I'm a realist. Excuse me; we have to have a meeting. Of course, pardon me if I've interfered. Friends In an hour we'll touch the surface. We should be prepared for the unexpected. Professor Klimov will head the party. The party consists of Professor Ivanova Navigator Kolotun and Cadet Lebedev. -Yes, Captain. What about Neeya? She'd better stay here for now. It's impossible. It's impossible. In this case she's your responsibility. Any other questions? What about weapons? We were invited here, so I advice you not to take any weapons. What if a situation arises? Edik, try not to create a situation where you would have to defend yourself In the worst case use your inner resources. Isn't that my pen, Viktor? Attention, we've landed. What a morbid beauty. And this. It's all because of the sick air. Put the helmet on, don't attract attention. This place is airtight.. What a dress ball. -First there, then here.-It's not a dress ball. You can't go outside without a gas-mask. As for false-faces... They have what is to hide. Our miserable planet is greeting you. We would like to hope for salvation. People and their government are with you. We have earthquakes every day. Surface level subsides into the old empty underground mines. But here everything is solid. Our specialists are at your service. Scientific coordinator Liy. Work. And let the intellectual help you. What's there? They are mutant animals. We don't know what they look like. We've never seen them. This is a bad place. Those that came here never returned. What's that building? It used to be Glan's institute. Can we go there? No. There's almost nothing left. Turanchoks lives there now. Who? You heard nothing about him? No. It's thanks to Sikki Turanchoks, that we're still breathing. I think you don't like him, colleague? How can you like a man that sells life? Gas masks for us and our children from Turanchoks, fresh air from Turanchoks. How can you like a man that makes a profit because my child has no air to breath? But Rakan is in the government now... Government is not all powerful. Look; these are the smoking pipes of Turanchoks' factories. What about Torki? Torki is one of the Turanchoks' men. For three days they've gone around in their rover. Sticking their noses in everywhere. Taking samples. Observing. I know. Your report, my dear, has a lot of white spots. I tried to do my best. I know, my precious, you've overdone it. Why did you steal samples from "Gaya" and bring suspicion on yourself? I didn't want them to guess the reasons of Glan's death. Do you know them? I can take a guess; Sikki Turanchoks. And you dare to talk about it? It's a lesson for me- not to surround myself with devoted fools. Times are changing and right now I could use them alive. -One of them is alive. -I know and will act. Well, don't be lazy as well my boy, that's not what I brought you up from the dirt for. If they succeed we'll have to grow grass and flowers. Do you know how to grow flowers? You know how to take money from me. And I know how to make that money because I take care of people, because I help people to breath. And I don't want to be bothered. They stick their noses in dangerous places. Displeasure with Earthlings should come from the people. I will take care of the displeasure of the people. -It feels good. -Happy? You and Klimov will have a hard day tomorrow. There is no life here. Damn you for what you did to the planet. It seems that you're disappointed with Dessa. Yes, but I'm only one here. What would change if there was 10,20,100 of you? Something would. What would you do? Careful... We would create our own planet. How? We would destroy all these factories. We would gather all the children that are still healthy and bring them up away from the others Their parents wouldn't let you. We wouldn't ask them. -It's all their own fault.-They would resist it. We would force them. There more and more of us in this world would become happy and free. It would be a cruel world with blood flowing. Let it for the sake of the great goal. Dear girl, Jesuits invented this formula long ago: The end justifies the means. It's very handy for henchmen. Victor, neither me nor my father have never been henchmen. Your father was naive in hoping to save Dessa by creating you. I'm afraid that he himself became a victim Of the henchmen that blew up your "Gaya". We don't have any other choice except to come back. We're running out of food and fuel. Friends are silent. Father, you always believed in friends. Not anymore. What about Rakan? Successful friends could be even dangerous. It's strange that we are still alive. Why are you wearing a spacesuit? You asked me to fix the outer antenna. Maybe we don't hear word from them because of it's malfunction. Oh yes; yes, do go. I'll keep an eye on you. We're going to start a local cleaning tomorrow. -Please, Klimov. -So, We'll begin at 10am sharp. 12 km south-west from a cosmoport. You must stay protected. -Is a bunker ready? Victor, we're ready. Let's begin. Oleg, it's working, turn up the energy level... Take it easy Victor, it's on maximum for this stage. Where is this coming from? It all got accumulated up there. We condensed it with plasma charges. This is horrible. Don't be afraid. Their goal is to astonish and to amaze us. Maybe they'll fail... Don't underestimate the enemy, my dearest. I believe in their powers, and soon thousands of others will believe in them too. That's why they're conducting this demonstration. Our cleaning worked. Do you understand? Our cleaning worked. -Viktor, you're working. -Yes, I'm working. Yes, I'm working. I'm working, working. I have a good job. Very good. What's he doing? It's acid. It's rain. It's real rain. It's still hard to breath. It's OK. We'll plant trees. We'll plant trees. We'll plant lots of trees. It will be easy to breath. What's wrong? -I'm with you. -I'm alone. -It's not true. -I'm alone. I was created for no purpose. I thought somebody needed me. That I have a goal. What is it? It's the same as mine. We have a common goal. Do you understand? Common. The rain is over, take a look at what the sky should look like. It's not harmful? It's much more harmful to live in catacombs. You're like gods from our dream of a future. -It's just a coincidence. -You may call it a coincidence. But many of us never got to see such a light. Only now I understand all the greatness of intellect. Now this road is open to you too. Perhaps. They succeeded. Now we must succeed. And remember that a blue sky is very harmful to the eyes. Oleg. It's 6:18. The results are very satisfactory for a first attempt. I'm glad. It's all over. What a pity. Today we only showed you what it will be like. I'm afraid. I feel very lonely. As if I am divided. -Are you feeling bad? -Yes. -What is it? I'll tell you. I'll tell you later. Neeya. Earthlings came to poison us and to take over our planet. You see, they've already begun. This is our last source of clean water. We won't have it anymore. We'll die from thirst. I'm by the water basin at the town square. - I'm coming Tell Victor that some kind of active chemical reaction is happening in the water. One man is blaming Earthlings; people are afraid. Don't go alone. I tell this to Victor. I'll stay here and observe. She's here, she's the one to blame. They're killing us. She's the one to blame. They're killing us. They're poisoning us. She's the one to blame. Good. It's working. Ter, Shoot her. -Shoot her? -Shoot her. Again. And again. What did they do to you? They can't do anything to me. They wanted to kill you. That doesn't matter. They're not worth it that's for their own sake... What happened here is horrible. But, my dear girl, they're not to blame. They are sick and asleep. Their minds are asleep. We have to wake up their minds. Cure them. We have to help them, not to despise them. You have to help them. What a strange and uncommon reaction. They said that the water is dead. -It was poisoned. Liy, who could do such a thing? They fight over power even when the planet is dying. They're willing to do anything. And we are powerless. We are dead now. Today I will bring chemicals from the ship. The water will be clean by the nightfall. You are alive. You are not wounded. -It's hard to kill me.-Thank god. You shouldn't be outside without an escort. -The closer our goal is, the stronger the resistance of our enemies.-Sikki Rakan. Excuse me. Sikki Rakan. There was another controlling device of Glan's children on Dessa. Yes, there was. But no one will ever find it. It's destroyed. I can hear a call. The call? You can hear a call? Keep it down. Of course, of course. This is horrible. If he managed to find the secret lab... then he'll discover a biomass as well. -What? When your father was leaving he showed me the secret laboratory. That's where the controlling device was and a biomass. What is a biomass? It's a cell structure that Glan wanted to use to create perfect people. He was very worried. But I didn't say a word to anybody. Trust me, to anybody. I have to destroy the controlling device. -How? The company "Fresh Air"occupies the institute building now. And the laboratory is deep underground. - I'll find it. Neeya you need to return to the ship And start testing water samples. -Why? It's dangerous for you to be here. That makes sense. I'll take care of everything. I will. Sikki Turanchoks, Sikki Rakan wants to know if you can see him. Finally, I was expecting his visit. He came asking for peace. What for? He's got the power. I've got the real power. Power shouldn't be obvious. Go now, my dearest. And don't you eavesdrop. Deal? I salute you Turanchoks. -I came by myself.-I commend you my friend. I have a favour to ask. I'll be happy to help you. Have a seat. I'm asking you not to stay in the way of Earthlings. Your words are bold, my old friend. You think that they'll protect you? Now the destiny of the whole planet is at stake. I'm ready to sacrifice my life for Dessa. Maybe so. -Don't torture Neeya.-You know that I found the controlling device. Forget that it exists. Leave Neeya alone. Ah, conscience of the old man. You lost your best friend Glan. You'll lose Neeya as well; You're the victim of your own vanity. Did Glan use your cells to grow his bastards? I was sure that I would be able to return him. As soon as we take the power. Glan could come back after you came to power, but you were afraid to mess up your career. I was thinking about Dessa. You didn't say a word even when I was buying this building of Glan's institute. I will not argue with you-I'm a peaceful man. But you and your Earthlings pushed me against the wall. Now I have to destroy you. Because I also have duties. Duty before Dessa. Duty before the Keepers. You are the keepers of death. You're the keepers of degradation. Yes, my conscience is not clean but I'm doing everything to save Dessa. In this I remain a friend and pupil of Glan. -You killed him. -But I will save his dream. -You will fail. -I will succeed Turanchoks, I will succeed. Our planet is the house we live in, and we can't abandon it. We try to tell ourself that nature is wise, that it will find a way to save itself. Today we can still hear the sound of our forests and the laughter of our children. Today we still have natural resources and birds are still singing. We still have plenty, they used to say. Not anymore. No more rivers, no more animals, no more resources, no more air. Every second child born deformed and we cover our faces with laughing masks. We destroyed ourselves with the damned wars. We are all killers of Dessa, but you- you are double. Because you breath fresh air yourself and sell it to the others. Your built your own well being on the misfortune of the others. That's a lie. You've never seen me before? You're a weak man, Rakan. Do you want to see a controlling device? You will see it. Now you control who your daughter listens to. Neeya, Can you hear me? Can you hear me? -You're late Turanchoks.-Say it again? Earthlings know about you. Neeya is in the safety of the ship. Damn it. I'm late, I'm late, I'm late. Neeya, can you hear me? -Yes. Where are you, Neeya? I'm coming to you. I'm looking for you. I'm waiting for you in your house. I'm coming. -Do you think an hour will be enough, my old friend? -What's on your mind? I'm going to blow up Astra. You're a maniac. I'm more normal than all of you. and smarter too. I'm smart. If Astra explodes everything will go back to normal. And your daughter will help me with that. She will bring this onto Astra -No, I won't let you -Neeya, come here. -Neeya, stop. -Neeya, come here. You're ticklish. Get him away from me. Away. You're tick... You found me. It's my duty. Dangerous. Get up Rakan. I'll help you to kill Turanchoks. Remember that door. Give me your hand. I'm afraid to leave a supply of biomass here. Is it so dangerous? It's not dangerous today, but it may become tomorrow. This is my new invention. Don't be afraid. I can handle it. This also has my cells? No, this is a different principle. When we succeed, I will build new people using it. People can be created by inserting a human brain into this matter. It's just a building material now. It's sleeping now. But it can digest any organic matter. Until it gets a brain it'll be insatiable. Neeya disappeared. -What about Barmalei? -He's gone too. Neeya, where are you? Can you hear me? This is bad. -You can't even imagine how bad it is. -Barmlaei is with her. What can this old pile do? Barmalei, it's Klimov. Where are you? I'm following Neeya. -My coordinates 34-2. -Good work. I'm going to run. It's Glan's institute. -Don't rush. -I'll go with him. I'll wait for the rover. Take the water sample. Take it, take it. Follow me. to Turanchoks. Come. Neeya, you're a good girl, I'm waiting for you. Torki, keep an eye on her every second. Get everybody out of her way. That way. I'm sensing aggression. It's dangerous here. Follow me. Who's that? Stop. Bastard. Hello my girl. I was waiting for you. Who are you? I am your god. Can you get to Astra? Excellent. It's fine, my dear, it's fine. You'll go to Astra and it will blow it up. You have to be there in 30 Min. Go. Neeya, you're going the right way. Go to Astra. She walked by me. Follow her. Your head is at stake. What happened? Idiot. Follow her. Calling Klimov. Calling Klimov. I can't consume all of this aggressive matter. It's a danger for the whole planet. Where is Barmalei? -Quickly. -Something's wrong. Nadezhda and Edik will take care of her. Go to Astra. Neeya, the ship will be here soon. You can't stay here. It's a dangerous place. They'll kill you. Come with me. I can't, I can't. -Go to Astra. -Get a hold of yourself. You're human, not a robot. --You don't understand...-Come with me. I mustn't get on the ship. Go to Astra. What is it? This is death. They found a bomb. What do I do? Kill. Hostile environment. Danger for the entire planet. Viktor, come back. Take it easy, boy. What's this? Viktor Klimov. Help. Nadezhda was killed. Victor. Help. Nadezhda was killed. Klimov, Klimov, what's going on? Captain, we need Astra's help. Biomass escaped from the Glan's institute. It's rapidly growing and multiplying by consuming anything organic. It just broke out of the building. It's a disaster for the whole planet. We don't know what to do. Get the ship ready. Get the radiating guns ready I'm coming. Would you come with me? All pictures of dying Dessa have been taken on the Earth. To the stars by the hard ways 1981 To the stars by the hard ways.
