I have no money. No. My pension is 300 Forints. One has to live, too. I have more than enough pictures. I wish I had one of my mother. Come, quick, come. Lift her up. Okay'? Hold her. Let's stop for a minute. Take the picture now. Okay? Well, I've been to many places. Békéscsaba, and in the Tatras, There came that... blue water down from the mountain. Like blue dye. It fell from a high mountain. Fell down there. But by the time it got down, it wasn't blue any more. When was this picture taken of you'? How old was I then'? I already had three children. Would you like us to take some good pictures of you'? But then make them big, not small. Well'? I don't know. A picture is a nice souvenir, isn't it'? Yes, but... She has pictures but we don't hang them up like that. They're not very good'? When she won't be home any more, then we'll hang them up. When she goes to the end of the village. - How old is she'? - 89. Here is my photographer friend. Please come into the other room. Your feet hurt'? My feet have been hurting for 9 years now. - Who is the young man'? - The poor boy was my son. - Did he die'? - 26 years ago. He was 30. He was a foot soldier. Soldiers weren't taken by car, they walked. He got pneumonia, but he wasn't taken to hospital. He just kept on marching. His mates put some wet clothes on him, wrapped him in his wet shirt and he marched on with the others. By the time he got home he had such a hole in his lungs that soon... This was the father. He died in 1950. He was lying in the coffin. She still kept twirling his moustache. I'm not afraid of the dead. Wouldn't it be nice if we made a picture of you, too'? No, don't put that there. How come you never got married'? Ma didn't let me go. Why didn't you? We were so stupid, we didn't even know people existed in the next village. It was good only here. Only in our home. - Why didn't you let her go'? - I was afraid for her. She doesn't want to get married. It's better like this. lt's better for me, too. Nobody harms me. You fed me only to kill me, I became your life. My blood in yours doth circulate. What need have you of strife? We eat and murder every day, Each day with blood blooms the bier. lt's no good. I think it's good. I must tell you the truth. I really don't like it. Show me something better than this. God, did I have such stubble'? Is that me at all'? It's me, yes. Here, no, it's there. Where's my son'? He was here. That soldier. - Call him. - Pityu, come. Look at this. Come, take a look. Come, can you recognise me'? - God, you look like a weather wane. - Fantastic. - It's tremendous. - lt's no good'? There you are. I see. This way. There you are. Mummy looks at Daddy. That's me. There you are and there's Daddy. How do you like them'? I don't know. That's not what we had in mind. - What then'? - Something different. More serious pictures. These aren't ones you can hang up on the wall. We can't hang these up. Why non? They are not natural and... That's exactly why you could. You all look happy and carefree. But the surrounding isn't like that, either. I really don't like it. Nature for itself, the Artist as Man works for Man. From what Nature gives us, we find it difficult to recognise which is enjoyable. What the artist gives to Man should be moving and pleasant, relaxing and clear to all. - Hello, how are you'? - I was already looking for you. I says, where's that man who was playing music? Erzsike says, she doesn't know. The man who makes music? - Hello. - Mama, how are you'? A little better. I drank coffee and had some wine soup. - Pistuka, come over to this side. - I took medicine. - You drink coffee'? - Yes. We've come because the pictures are ready. I need my glasses. Erzsike, fetch them, please. Erzsike. - We need, Mama's glasses. - They'll be in the desk drawer. The pictures are ready. She wants to see them. I would like another five years. Csillag, don't. I'd like to live longer. By the time I brought up these children, there was some good, some bad... Now it would be good. That's not me. No, it's not. lt's not me. Not me. - But it's nice. - It scared me. But it's really beautiful. Look, how beautiful your eyes are. Don't you like them'? No. Don't even make any more. I know I'm ugly, but I'm still afraid of it. See, I'm sick, no'? - Why do you think so'? - Can't you tell that I'm sick? - Why'? - I can see myself that I'm sick. There are some we promised, that you'd hang on the wall. This is good. These are good. These are good. These are very good. This one, it scares me. This is even better than this. - Why is this better'? - The face is more cheerful. These are good. These are okay, too. Oh, God, a ninety-year-old woman. Thank you very much. Good-bye. We are off. I wish you good health. Same to all of you. And a long life. I don't need much any more, only five more years. That would be nice. You'll have more than that. One more for us, let's take a parting shot. - Look that way. - For a souvenir, dear Mama. That way, towards the sun. Doesn't nip, she's just playing. Like a girl, you see. She's also a girl. Mare, we call it a mare. The filly is a mare, a girl is a girl. A boy is a child. She can be pretty mean. - Like that'? - Hey, Csillag. - If you had a piece of paper... - Look here, like this. A bag with corn, you rattle it and she pricks up her ears. Look here, like this. Now look here. We'd like one with the horse's side fully towards us. Now she's looking. You smile, too. Be proud that you have such a horse. Isn't that what you want'? She'll be beautiful, a mother-mare. If you'd lead her straight this way, that's good. Like this, to the side? Come. Yes, go. Now, take it. That's good for us. Just like a fitchet. Gallops like a fitchet. Completely like a fitchet. Had a mean march. Good, cut out, very nice. That's nice. A proud march. Like a fitchet. Let's agree how much you want to spend on the pictures. 300 Forints. - 300 Forints. - 300 Forints. I don't want it without the wife. She's an awfully rough woman. No, it won't be more. Doesn't matter. 300 Forints. You'll select the ones you like, okay'? - What fits into 300 Forints. - Okay then. You should come in the summer because she swims really beautifully. In the water. You should find me in the summer. That would be an unusual picture... She swims better than a crocodile. Her back is out and she steers herself with her tail. Not the horse's ass, what are you doing'? Come here. - She won't kick you. - Come here. I'll clobber him on the head and then you take a picture of him. We have brought these pictures. Your husband ordered some pictures from us... Shall we wait for him'? Won't you look at the pictures'? Are you not interested'? We don't want to annoy you, really. He said that we should make him pictures for 300 Forints. And if they are good, he'll take them. - He must have been a handsome man. - He was handsome. But so are you. Once I was. Do you recon that you were an attractive woman'? - Me'? - As a girl, when you were young'? How should I know'? The old man can tell you what I was like. - Don't cry. - I'm not crying. I'm laughing. I'm laughing. What kind of woman was Mama, would you tell us'? To me first class. She was first class. I was away for 2 years, they didn't hear from me, and I only heard the best about her. I had six cattle, they went out to the herd with clean tails, my wife worked, ploughed, sowed, she wasn't ashamed to work. When was this picture taken'? - 20 years ago at least. - This picture was taken 20 years ago. - Are the girls married'? - Yes. - Then there are grandchildren, too. - There are. And the boy'? He isn't here. - He had to leave home. - Why'? Because he behaved like that. To us. He was banished from home by the Court. - By the Court? - Yes. - Why'? What did he do'? Even when we die, he shouldn't come to our coffin. Unfortunately. Did he get married'? They say he has a family. He has five children. 4 or 5. He lives among Gypsies. - Among Gypsies? - Among Gypsies. Unfortunately. He says, I'm 24, father, don't order me around. Don't shout. Father, you don't tell me what to do, he says. My father still order me around. Then once it got so bad, I couldn't take it any more. I went to the police, they asked, did anybody die'? I say, not yet. But I know he got it often. - Did you hit your father? - Yes. - Why did that happen'? - Well, it happened. Because he was arguing, that's why. Did he try to order you about'? - In what'? - Everything. - Everything'? - Everything. And did he deserve a beating'? Yes, and how! Maybe even to this day. Either he gives orders, or I do. Why should he give us orders'? We don't live off him. Why should he give orders to us'? What did he get in ten years'? 4 or 5 kids, but he has no clothes, he has nothing in the world. I wanted to make a man of him, like I am. I said, don't be better, but don't be worse. Just like me. You fed me only to kill me, I became your life. My blood in yours doth circulate. What need have you of strife? My blood in yours doth circulate. What need have you of strife? Why did you marry him'? Because I loved him. - And now he wants a divorce or you do'? - He wants a divorce. - Do you want it'? - No. - When did you see him last'? - Yesterday. And what did he say'? Nothing, just that he'll file the divorce suit. - What reason does he give'? - He couldn't tell you himself. How come you're home'? I just wanted to ask if the doctor was here. He wasn't. Please be kind and leave the yard. This is not a circus. Get out of here. We just want to take a few pictures. My yard is not a circus. Get out, take your stuff. I don't want to see anybody here. Sorry. We're going. Stand here. Okay'? No'? - Angry'? - No. - You look angry. - I was just thinking. Oh, Oh, Oh, our feature's the photo. Oh, Oh, Oh, our feature's the photo. All, all, all, we'll come to your house if you call. All, all, all, we'll come to your house if you call. We turn the camera, we snap the camera the ass and the kids at play, we immortalize the day. Oh, oh, oh, the future belongs to the photo. All, all, all, we'll come to your house if you call. All, all, all, we'll come to your house if you call. We turn the camera, we snap the camera the ass and the kids at play, we immortalize the day. we immortalize the day. Stand here please. There, down there. Just stand facing her and take the picture. - Finished'? - Finished. - Hi. - Hi. Listen, we should do something unusual. Something artistic. If you could stand a little closer, turn your back to me, like this, and look at my friend over your left shoulder. Good, like that. Very good. Smile. More, like that. Smile at him nicely. How much did you pay for this picture'? 480 Forints. The kitchen will be here... That'll be a room... We worked things out so we wouldn't fall into debt. 400 are done already. The next 100 are already coming up. 3-4000 for us, and my sister-in-law needs the same. 3-4000. Will you please stand there'? Mother got a stroke again. She can get up now, but she couldn't even get up. Would be nice to see this ugly face of mine. Shall I give you some nuts? Shall I crack some'? I had some nuts growing here. On this tree. I have some cracked but I won't give you those, I had so much trouble with them. I'll take them to the market, but I can bring some down from the attic. Are you married, Ma'? Married'? I was 30 when I got married. Because I had a crippled brother. He was a basket maker. He had his hands like this, and he walked like this. I didn't want to get married, I didn't want him to be kicked and pushed around by nobody. My mother died early, she had heart trouble. I watched her for three days in the room, because she said, until she bursts, I shouldn't bury her. She burst, my dear man, and I went out, I had a vineyard close by, but now the co-op took it over. I went out to the vineyard, such a nice mint, a nice smelling flower, maybe you don't know it. I pick a flower and I don't smell anything. I crush it to make it smell stronger, still nothing. I can't smell it. There was a doctor called Pál Jenei. They even had a seamstress. I said to him, doctor, I can't smell. He says, dear Juliska, you got corpse poisoning. Before, I could tell from the street what people were cooking in the houses. Thank God, at least I can hear. When they announce that the train leaves from Track 2, I can hear that. But my husband, nothing. And he was a telephone operator for 32 years. In Ferencvéros. When your husband married you was he a widower'? He was divorced. And why did he get a divorce'? He had 2 daughters a 17-year-old and 13-year-old. Are they married now'? No. Both of them had their throats cut with a razor blade. Who did it'? Their mother. And when they broke in on her, she nicked hers a bit, too. The doctor said all three were dead. But then found the woman was alive. Her pulse was quite normal. Then they went over to the other girl, she was covered with a sack. Her feet were high up, like this. She was rigid like that. They went to the younger girl, her name was Klárika, her chin was cut like this. No, first her left hand. Then her chin was cut across like this, then she was cut here, then like this, from ear to ear. When she massacred them, they took her away. They took her to a prison hospital, then to Márianosztra. There is a Márianosztra, no'? She got there because she was Presbyterian. The nuns told her to convert to Catholicism, and God would forgive her sins. She did, so she is a Catholic now. But my husband and I are Presbyterian. Yes. Do you have pictures of the girls? Yes. Dead and also alive. - Would you show me'? - Yes. - Are you both coming in'? - Yes. Please go. Quiet there. He hasn't had breakfast yet. Good morning. Okay. Now I'm here. These were the girls. This is their mother, this is the older Margitka, the younger Klárika. Margitka was already this big. She was 17 when... Now her mother will kill her. Now she is 17. - Who is she'? - Their mother. - And she did it'? - She did it. This is my husband. This... it has Klárika written on it. She got four cuts. Before she died. Imagine what that little girl must have felt while she was murdering the 17-year-old one. Yes. If one looks at this face, at her picture, how can he imagine that she could do such a thing'? Well, my dear, because, she kicked my husband out of her bed because Bukvár was her lover. Bukvár died, but she is still alive. She was a very beautiful woman. She still is. Look at this picture. Could you tell from it what she did'? I couldn't. It was her rotten blood that made her do it. My husband says, she couldn't help it that her blood was like that. He doesn't say anything about her even today. She couldn't help it that her blood was like that. And Bukvár was also like that. That's me. It was in my travel pass. It's to be renewed every year but I don't put my ugly pictures in it. I choose the nicest one and put it there. It's valid until 1972. This is a better picture. Now my face is very ugly. This is our wedding picture. I must have been 27 or 28. I was an old maid when I got married because of my crippled brother. I say, there are so many scoundrels, they shouldn't kick and toss him around, so I'll never get married. But my husband was so pushy... This was my father and that is my crippled brother. This was my father, Józsi Csereklei, and this is Gyula Csereklei. This was the poor cripple. What was the matter with him'? The poor thing got crippled. The marrow ran out of his bones. My grandmother was very rich, my father, too, but my mother was a poor girl. And my wicked grandma didn't want my father to marry a poor girl, but my mother was beautiful. Then in December she threw them out of their home. They lived by the Serbian church. It was a stable. My father closed it off with wineshoot. They lived inside, and the oxen outside. He caught a cold there and his marrow filled with puss. They had no science then, they didn't take him to Budapest, they couldn't do that because they didn't know. So the poor boy just discharged, clogged up, discharged again, then a Jewish doctor came, a very good doctor, he said, he can't do anything for him, he wouldn't live for long. But you are so nervous, come and visit me. But I didn't go. I also had a terrible life. I was a day labourer, I was everything except a whore. I don't wear the kiss of a single man. I had something like twenty odd suitors. There was even a station master. He was from Zemplén county, from Szakáli. His brother, Jani Kostecki is the dean of the church in Bakáts Square if it is still there. Those Calvinists play it big. The poor boy wanted me to turn Catholic. He was right for me, he was young, one or two years older than me, he comes to the gate dressed in white, with two gold rosettes. His father writes me that my dear young lady, but don't be offended, because there are Catholics here, too. His father writes that my dear young lady, the Presbyterian religion is no religion. It's stolen. That's what his father writes me. And I wrote back to him. He was a district court judge. Dear Mr. Kostecki, if you'd go under a very large apple tree to steal, you'd just pick the cream of the crop. I says, you just leave the rotten ones. They didn't write me after that. His brother said he would teach me the Catholic religion. And nobody has to know about it. I'll convert, get married and nobody will know. I didn't do it. The boy comes here, then we went to the Catholic church, they were playing the organ and singing in Latin there. He was a very good boy. And didn't you regret that you didn't convert? Now it doesn't matter what I answer but that would have been the best. But God wanted it like this, and all the stupid thinking. God wanted it like this. When my husband came to propose I told him that I'll never marry him, not as long as I live. Because you still loved the other one. I still think of him a lot. I'd lived with my husband for 7 years, I didn't want him. I said to him, if you come here, I'll kick you out. But he was stubborn. My uncle said, you'll get old, get married. He is a good telephone operator, he has a little fortune, you're healthy, he is a good man, so I married him. Do you regret it'? Finally I didn't regret it because he doesn't hurt me, he is a good man. He gets his pay, gives it to me to portion it out, I even manage to spare some. So when we die, no one should have to pay for the funeral. Wouldn't you like to have a picture taken of the two of you together'? With such an ugly mug'? Listen, my dear, we have no family, no one in the world wants that any more. Even this I'll throw in the fire one fine day. But such a beautiful picture of you. Beautiful of us, my dear sir, a beautiful picture, you cannot make something beautiful from something ugly. Do you think that someone who is old is ugly'? I'm already ugly, yes. My husband, no, he looks better. But not me. My eyes are sunken. I'm no longer pretty. If I were still like this, then I would say that I wanted one. But like this, don't bother with me. We'll give you a good rate. I'm not having any made. I'm not even combed. I'd have to curl my hair a bit to look better. We' ll wait. No. No. Well, I don't care, make some just the way I am and when you leave, I'll burn it. I don't want it. Make it, so you could make some money, too. After you have bothered so much with us. You can take some. Papa will sit next to me. Then when you are gone, I'll burn them. Especially since the law is that we can't have two houses, nobody wants us. But in that other house my husband has forty thousand bricks. Come. We'll sit here. Sit down, rest a little. I'm so tired. Maybe you want to marry my granddaughter'? No, I don't want to marry your granddaughter. I don't even have one. Can you talk to Pa since he is so deaf? I shout real loud into his ear, but my heart tires with it. Didn't you think about getting a hearing aid'? He has one but he has the kind that you have to put a battery in. I'm so old. There is an electric shop, but I don't know any more. It closes like this or like this. You don't know how to handle it'? Then I forgot. When I brought it home and put it into his ear, as we were talking, he heard everything. - Did he hear you'? - He says, I hear you, Juliska. The next day I tried again but he couldn't hear me. Would you bring out that device'? - But there is no... - We have batteries here. - I'll look for it. - It takes a square battery, right? - A square battery. - Yes, that'll be it. I don't know if you have to turn it on this way or that way'? We'll see. Maybe he'll hear. The old man. You fed me only to kill me, I became your life. My blood in yours doth circulate. What need have you of it? Look, this dear man has found it. The one who stayed inside. It's been lost a very long time. It has this little thing, this. Bring it here. It has this thing. It was even longer then. Put it in his ear. Open this. I haven't seen one like this, but we'll try. Maybe it'll work. The excitement got to my belly. That's what happens, because I didn't find it. That's how I am. If I put a knife away, not in the right place, it takes me an hour to find it. Then I forget it. But what happened forty years ago, that I don't forget. I think there's nothing wrong with this, it just has to be turned on. Try to put it in his ear. Careful, you turned it on too high. Boy, it's shrieking. Don't you hear us'? Don't you'? Do you hear with it? I hear, I just don't understand the words. Don't you understand what I'm saying'? - Now this I understand. - Do you hear what I'm saying? Let's try to put it in real well. Careful. Hold this. It's whistling like mad. - I'll speak to him, okay? - Please wait... Speak Ma. - Let me speak. Listen here, Pa. - Now I don't hear anything. Listen to what I'm saying. Now you can speak. ls it better'? I don't hear anything. Listen here. Listen to what I'm saying. I'm saying that this song... There's no noise at all in it. - Listen already. - I don't hear you. You don't hear me now'? You don't hear anything'? It's probably not put in well, because it's okay here. - Give it to me. - lt's whistling. And now, like this, it just whistles? - Still nothing. - Can you hear me now'? - Put it in, press it close to his ear. - There's nothing in it. - Now, uncle Lajos... - Well... - ls it whistling'? Do you hear now'? - Now I hear. - Do you hear me'? - I do. - Now I'll speak to him. - But not there. Speak there. - It's enough. lt's very loud. - ls it loud enough'? - Will you come with me for artesian water'? - Yes. What should we bring it in'? That big pail'? - The one you use to bring it in. - Yes. - On your arm. - Yes. Well, he hears it. Will you allow me to ask him about this? ls it okay'? - I'd rather do it. - Well, okay. Will you ask'? Lajos, who are these here'? Who is this? - What'? - Who are these little girls? - Who are they'? - Yes. The Nyerges girls. Which is the older, which is the younger'? - Towards your hand. - Which one is that'? That's the older one. That's her. - What's her name'? - Margit. - And the other's'? - Klári. - And this? - This is their mother. What kind of woman was she'? We, well, she... She was serious. Also vain. She was vain. And what else? What did this woman do'? - What did she do'? - Yes. What did she do to your daughters'? Please ask something else. It depends on how long this works. It's important that you don't touch it. I'll handle it. So nothing goes wrong. I'll tell you something. You needn't talk into this. It's plain good and clear, then it's enough. To your questions I can give mere words, but all things answer to themselves. To your questions I can give mere words, but all things answer to themselves. How's the resemblance'? I'm not going there anyway. Does it look like her'? It looks like her except her face has too many wrinkles. - Too many wrinkles'? - She doesn't have this many in life. Then how come there are so many in the photograph'? I don't know. I guess, the way you made it. Or how do I know'? The wind's torn it down. Would she like it, do you think, if she saw this picture'? I don't know. I don't think so. - No, - How could she like it that she's so old'? Don? squeeze me, don't smother me, with your hair, don't cover me, Castle strong with whirlwind high, My poor life doesn't occupy. You spit cold fire into the snow, Stand in satin 'gainst the wintry blow Your ivory breasts so snowy white, My eyes for them 'most lose their light Your ivory breasts so snowy white, My eyes for them 'most lose their light Your virtue is like all bad money, Your beauty is a noble song, Our bodies are the devil's harp, Hey, let him play us till we die. Our bodies are the devil's harp, Hey, let him play us till we die. No, I don't want to recognise him. It's Nyerges. When did you see him last'? Ten... no, what am I saying'? When it happened. It's been more than thirty years. Here. No, I saw this already. Nothing matters any more. I'm going to do my chores. Leave me alone. How long do you want to stay'? I wouldn't exert myself any more. I still think that man loved you. If he had loved me, he wouldn't have acted like that. Did you really speak to him? I don't believe it, you know. He's deaf. Deaf'? He should be blind, not deaf. Do you hate him so much'? Totally. I can't even express how much I hate him. Look, I'm not the culprit. He is. He just forced me into it, like when they say do it, because if you don't, I'll break your neck. But how did he force you'? With his conduct. He looks like a good man. Good, quiet. The frog lives in a quiet lake. He's quiet. Is his drunkard wife still alive'? So he got married, married an old maid who has legs like this. You weren't on good terms with her'? She did nothing to me. I don't care. She married him because she was getting on in years. Now just tell me, if someone kills herself, she does it for fun'? Is she sane'? Look, okay, I'll let you think. Why does someone kill herself? Tell me. As far as I know, if you are not desperate, you can't do it. If I had had it so good with him, would I have committed suicide? He didn't bother me with jealousy, but he made me boil the bones twice. Why did you take the children with you'? So they would be exposed to nothing. Look, my mother died when I was about four years old. Only I know what I suffered. We have to die once anyway, well, then let them come with me. They told him not to take them, why is he taking them'? He said, for a week or two it will be bad for them but they'll get used to it, he said. How did he take the children'? How'? He gave thirty pengos each month. But he didn't even want to give that. Was he stingy? Hell, he made me cook the bones twice. He was so excited about something, about wealth or whatever. That was his mania. Yes. He paid everyone, spent all his money on suits, spent everything. I had a piece of land, he even took that. He paid everything, everywhere. He paid a lot to be on top. So he could be right. Do you still think of the children'? There isn't a day when I don't. There isn't a day, no. Didn't you think that you might have more'? God forbid. No, not that. Did you think your sentence was just or not'? I never thought about it too much. But you just said Nyerges was the criminal. How does that fit'? Because but for him, it would never have happened. The proverb says: you can forgive, but not forget. But this, what he did, you can't forget And you can't even forgive it. I wish that God should let him live a very long time so he could feel the weight of what he did. He says to me, that man says, if I had been your judge, I wouldn't have punished you. Because, he says, you punished yourself when you did this. As many judgments, as people. - Do you want the kind of photograph that can be hung on the wall'? - Yes. Okay. We'll make one like that. The wheat will ripen. The wheat will ripen. The wheat will ripen. If the sun shines on it warmly. My heart will break if it suffers sorrow daily.
