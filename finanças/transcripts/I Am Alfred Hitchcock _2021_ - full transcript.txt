[Alfred Hitchcock] If you turn the volume up very loud... it will drown out screams. I believe in putting the horror in the mind of the audience. How do you do, ladies and gentlemen? My name is Alfred Hitchcock. [crash] You know, I sometimes consider getting out of this business. [Eli Roth] Hitchcock made it cool to be a director. He was so respectable. You don't picture him in sweatpants and a Hawaiian shirt. He's wearing that suit. He is iconic. [Edgar Wright] Alfred Hitchcock's films are cinema, and everything that you need to know about cinema is within those films, and, crucially, within that frame. [Ben Mankiewicz] He didn't just understand filmmaking. He helped develop it. He played a critical role in making storytelling onscreen what it is today. [Steven Spielberg] He was absolutely the master of suspense, and, therefore, he was a master manipulator. [Roche] You want Hitchcock to tell you where to look, tell you how to feel, tell you what to think. You want to be tricked by him, and you're happy to be fooled. Alfred Hitchcock is an adorable genius. [interviewer] You invariably appear in your own films, Mr. Hitchcock. Have you ever been tempted to become an actor yourself? Nothing so low as that. [John Landis] He was very funny, and sometimes quite vulgar. [Alfred Hitchcock] Have you been a bad woman or something? Well, not just bad, but... But you've slept with men. Oh, no! You have not? Come here. Stand in your place. Otherwise, it will not come out right, as the girl said to the soldier. [John Landis] Why is he so remembered? Because he made sure to be. That's enough. This is Alfred Hitchcock. Having lived with "Psycho” since it was a gleam in my camera's eye, I now exercise my parental rights in revealing a number of significant facts about this slightly extraordinary entertainment. [Adam Roche] Hitchcock needed "Psycho” to be a huge hit. He was personally financing it. There were rumors that the bosses weren't happy with what he was making. [Alexandre O. Philippe] There was a lot of issues around this idea that this 61-year-old filmmaker was taking on this trashy pulp novel. Most people told him, "Don't do it. It's beneath you." [Alfred Hitchcock] Well, "Psycho” is my first attempt at a shocker. In some sense, it could be called a horror film, but the horror only comes to you after you've seen it, when you get home, in the dark. [Philippe] The first thing that Hitchcock did was bought as many copies of Robert Bloch's novel as he could get his hands on to get it off the market, so that people wouldn't know what happens in "Psycho". [Roche] He didn't want any details of the film getting out there. He made his crew swear an oath that they would not talk even about his methods on set. Finally, they got their first glimpse when the trailers started appearing in cinemas... ...and it was just this seven-minute clip of Hitchcock walking around to this jovial music. Good afternoon. Here we have a quiet little motel, [Eli Roth] He is the most famous director in the world, no question, not even a close second. No one from the French New Wave, no one's coming close to what Hitchcock's doing, certainly not in America, and not in world cinema. Instead of watching a trailer, going, "Who is this director and why are they talking?" It's, "Uh-oh. How is Alfred Hitchcock going to get us this time?" Bathroom. [Roche] The critics, who were expecting to be able to go in and see the film and appraise it before the public got to see it, were disallowed, which just led to more anticipation. [Alfred Hitchcock] I've suggested that "Psycho" be seen from the beginning. In fact, this is more than a suggestion. It is required. [Philippe] Back in the day, people were walking in and out of movies. You know, you could walk into the middle of a film, watch it until the end, watch the first half, and then walk out. He basically built the entire advertising campaign around this idea that once the movie starts, you cannot go in the theatre. What it did is that people started lining up now to go watch "Psycho”. It built anticipation. "What is this thing that's going to happen in the film? Why do I have to show up on time?" It also now changed the way that we watch movies. The lines of people waiting to go see "Star Wars,” it's all because of Hitchcock, in a way. [Mark Ramsey] No one had more doubts about it than Hitchcock himself. He was convinced this was the biggest disaster of his career. [Roche] Throughout the '50s and '60s, there'd been this movement in France called the "auteur theory". It was the theory that certain directors have certain looks to films. You know, they have their stamp on them so entirely that they could never be made by anyone else. So many French critics, writers, directors were saying that Alfred Hitchcock deserved to be known as an auteur, and the biggest proponent of that was Francois Truffaut. Francois Truffaut was very determined to see to it that Hitchcock got this accolade. It wasn't enough that audiences respected him. Critics had to respect him, too. He arranged an interview with Mr. Hitchcock, and, uh, told him why he was an auteur and why he really has shaped cinema in the 20th century, and the interview turned into one of the most famous and oft-quoted interviews of all time. [Alfred Hitchcock] There is no question that one of the pieces of good fortune... [woman speaking in French] .1 that nobody else understands this milieu, the suspense, the thriller fype of picture. [woman speaking in French] You see, that's why I've had the field to myself. [John Landis] Francois Truffaut was extremely intelligent, passionate about film, and he worshipped Hitchcock as a god, and Hitchcock took advantage of the situation to tell his story. [Alfred Hitchcock] | was so keen on film. At the age of 16, | would only read trade papers. When I discovered that an American company was opening in London, | wanted to get the job to do their titles. [Mankiewicz] Clearly, he made an impression very early on, because pretty quickly, he's into production design and writing screenplays for silent films. [Roche] Alfred Hitchcock's life at the time was very much a solitary existence. If he had a spare evening, he would go to the theatre. [Alfred Hitchcock] Well, I am shy. You know, I'm not very gregarious. | don't mix with a lot of people. | don't think I'm very good in the company of a lot of men. | don't know what it would be like among a lot of women. | don't know. [Mankiewicz] He was working at Gainsborough Studios, starting to develop his reputation, and he notices Alma. [Roche] She was an editor, and the rumor was that she was going to be an assistant director before long, because she was very much arising star. He admired her straight away. [Mary Stone] Hitch was petrified of her at times. She was 411", and a tough, mighty, little woman. [Alfred Hitchcock] I was 23 at the time... [woman speaks in French] ...and f'd never been out with a girl in my life. I'd never had a drink in my life. [Patricia Hitchcock] In those days, a gentleman would not talk to a lady if he had a job below hers, so he had to wait until he was promoted, and then he was able to talk to her. [Roche] He was offered an assistant director's chair under Graham Cults. He needed an editor. He thought, "Well, now's my chance. | can finally get to meet Miss Alma Reville.” He contacted her and hired her, and that's how their relationship began. Graham Cutts was probably the rising star when it came to directors at the studio. British cinema at the time was very much in its infancy, and there was no real technique involved. People just found a stage play they liked and would point a camera at it. So when Hitchcock went to work for him, he was hoping to learn, I think, from Graham Cutts, but instead just found himself sidelined and very bored. Hitchcock soon developed this reputation for being the guy to go to if you needed anything on set. Graham Cutts slowly came to resent Hitchcock through that, especially as Michael Balcon was very a big fan of Alfred Hitchcock. [interviewer] In some ways, you were breaking info his territory. Oh, I not only broke into territory, | gave him the shots and where they should be taken. I built the set in such a way you couldn't take it from any other angle. [Roche] There was this constant power struggle between them both. | was told that the director of all these pictures was very jealous because I was getting credit for all this amount of work, and then he said he didn't want me anymore, so the producer said, would I like to direct? And I said, "It never occurred to me." [Roche] When he finished making "The Pleasure Garden," he handed it back to Michael Balcon and the studio, and they were very, very happy with it. The next step was to get it through the distributors, and the one that everyone needed to use in Britain at the time was a man called C.M. Woolf. Very, very rich, very, very powerful man. And he saw the film and refused to release it. He said that it didn't feel British enough. Hitchcock was devastated, but he pressed on, because he was confident that sense would prevail eventually. So he went to film "The Mountain Eagle”. C.M. Woolf watched "The Mountain Eagle”, again said, "This film is not British enough. You can't release this. | don't like it." So Michael Balcon suggested maybe they should come up with something different, a bit more radical than a melodrama. He suggested Belloc Lowndes' novel, "The Lodger," and Hitchcock instantly saw the possibilities. [Alfred Hitchcock] This is a book about the landlady asking herself the question, "Is the man who is my lodger Jack the Ripper or not?" [Roche] Hitchcock spent many, many weeks preparing for "the Lodger". He storyboarded meticulously. He came up with ideas that had never, ever been attempted before on film, | had the faces of the people below looking up to the ceiling, and I dissolved the ceiling away. | had a glass floor made, which today we would do sound. [Roche] "The Lodger" was a genuine masterpiece, and it was a potential smash hit, C.M. Woolf arrived at the screening with Graham Cuts, who was actually a friend of C.M. Woolfs and had been the bird that sat on his shoulder, chirping into his ear these past few years, telling him what an awful man Alfred Hitchcock was. The director that I had been working for was looking at the rushes, and reported to the producer, he said, "I don't know what the devil he's shooting. | don't understand a word of it." [Roche] So they watched the film, and when the film was over, C.M. Woolf got up and walked out with Graham Cuts, making sure that Hitchcock heard as he walked past him that it was an atrocious lot of rubbish and it wouldn't be seeing a release in any of his cinemas. Michael Balcon was adamant that this one was going to get out there, 50 he contacted a friend of his that he knew called vor Montagu, who was a film critic at the time. Ivor Montagu started screening for his film circles and invited some of the critics and writers that he knew. These writers all banded together and wrote article after article. They preached to everyone who would listen that there was a film called "The Lodger". It was a masterpiece, needed to be seen, and it was being suppressed. [Alfred Hitchcock] And they said, "Well, we have an investment in this, better take a look at it again,” and they finally agreed to show it, and then it was acquired as the greatest British film made to that period. So there you seen the fine line between failure and success. [Roche] When people found out that there were two more Hitchcock films in the can and waiting to be released, they were even more eager to see those, and so over the course of 1927, from January to June, it was an Alfred Hitchcock fest. "The Lodger" is also the film where he made his first cameo. | think they just needed a stand-in for that day, and it became a trademark. [interviewer] You invariably appear in your own films, Mr. Hitchcock. Have you ever been tempted to become an actor yourself? Nothing so low as that. [Philippe] This idea of a filmmaker inserting himself into his movies is really interesting in the case of Hitchcock, because he is such an important part of his films. | think to have Hitchcock there physically made him an accessible figure. He became this kind of Uncle Alfred that we've embraced over generations... ...and I think it made it, in some way, easier and easier for him to play with us. [Landis] His cameos became what's now called an "Easter egg". It was there for the audience to spot, | think he started it just for fun, then it became almost like a chore. [Roth] John Ford, Cecil B. De Mille, their name became a brand. We don't have a mental picture in our head of those directors. Hitchcock-- you had to look for him in the movie. You had to watch the movie to go, "Oh, that's Alfred Hitchcock." [Roche] In the wake of the three films that finally got released in 1927, Hitchcock was suddenly in huge demand and was riding the crest of a wave, really. [camera shutter clicks] He married Alma. They were on a boat ride, and it was a very rough crossing, and she was incredibly seasick. He took her by the hand as she was swaying from side to side, and very biliously said to her, " want to marry you. Please, will you marry me?" And her answer was just a huge burp into his face, which he always said was perfectly played. [Tere Carrubba] My mother was born in July of 1928. She was their only child that they would ever have. [Stone] Alma and Hitch treated her as almost a little adult. They never left her side. She always went to dinners with them. Their life was her. [Ramsey] There's something about a director who trusts his spouse so much that they become collaborators in the process throughout your career. That was rare then. It's still rare today. [Stone] Alma was his strongest critic with stories that he brought to her. [Patricia Hitchcock] If she thought it would make a picture, he'd go ahead. If she said, "No, it won't,” he didn't even touch it. [Mankiewicz] Hitchcock's a prolific director of silent films in Great Britain, and then, really, he moves seamlessly into sound. [clap] This is sound. [piano key plunks] [plunk] [Roth] There were directors that just didn't survive. A lot of these star directors in the silent era did not adapt to talking. Hitchcock is not someone who's afraid of technology. Hitchcock embraces technology, and sees the opportunities, and wants to grow as a filmmaker with it. [Philippe] I think even when Hitchcock started working with sound, he never lost track of this idea of "pure cinema"-- what he calls "pure cinema,” which is this idea of how do you tell a story without a line of dialogue? [Alfred Hitchcock] Photographs of people talking bears no relation to the art of the cinema. Tell the story visually and let the talk be part of the atmosphere. [Roche] "The Man Who Knew Too Much” had been a huge hit, so Hitchcock had said to himself thrillers are the way to go. He and Alma decided that "The Thirty-Nine Steps” by John Buchan was a very well-regarded novel and could be a very well-regarded film. [train chugging over tracks] [Philippe] I think "The 39 Steps" really announces the thriller cinema in a big way, and Hitchcock's thrillers. [Mankiewicz] So we get an espionage thriller, we get an everyman thrust into a frantic situation that jeopardizes his life, and we get the Hitchcock blonde. Darling, how lovely to see you. [Roche] Hitchcock decided that Robert Donat and Madeleine Carroll didn't really have time for the whole, "Oh, let's get to know each other. Let's see if there's chemistry between you." So he handcuffed them together on their first day on set and then pretended to lose the key, so that they would have to get to know each other. So they spent the whole day dragging around, swapping stories, even having to use the bathroom, and by the end of the day, the chemistry was there. For a male and female character to be handcuffed together and sleeping in the same bed, it wasn't something you tended to see in '30s cinema anyway, but especially not British '30s cinema. [interviewer] Can I ask you, was this the beginnings of sex interest cropping up in your films consciously or not? Oh, I think that the handcuff and tying up is a highly sex symbol. You'll notice always newspapers photograph criminals being taken away in handcuffs. We used to read years ago of undergraduates at the college tying themselves to bedposts and all that sort of thing. | think it's highly sexual, the handcuff. [Roche] "The 39 Steps” is the first film in which you see the Hitchcock blonde, played by Madeleine Carroll, who really set the standard for the other blondes that were to follow. [suspenseful music plays] A Hitchcock heroine is smart, witty. | think they got smarter as they went along. They're sexy, but they're not overtly sexy. They're like an idealized version of womanhood, I guess. Well, according to Alfred Hitchcock. [Christina Lane] Hitchcock had a very good understanding of female characters, and he did a great job of putting you in the point of view of his female characters, 50 he often showed you them from a distance. He would give you a glamorous perspective on them, but then quickly, he would move you into their point of view, and he would show you what it felt like to be a woman objectified. Joan Harrison is really the inspiration for the Hitchcock blonde. There had been women who embodied a version of the Hitchcock blonde before the mid-1930s, but she really becomes much more realized onscreen once Harrison walks into the office. [Mankiewicz] Hitchcock hires Joan Harrison as his assistant, and very quickly, she becomes a critically-trusted colleague, along with Alma. She was helping to write scripts, helping to define female characters, helping to produce films. She was obsessed with true crime, and she was obsessed with film, which means she was working for the right guy. [Roche] She was instantly a hit with Hitchcock himself, and with Alma and Patricia. They all became very good friends. Hitchcock developed something of a crush on Joan Harrison. [Lane] She really carried herself like a lady, and yet on the inside, she tended to have a lot of layers. She had a lot of intellectual passions, and she was also very free in terms of her sexuality. One of the reasons that his films are so complicated in terms of gender and perspective is because he did have 50 many female collaborators, and there were 50 many women in the room, working on his stories and developing characters. [Roche] As his thrillers took flight, 50, too, did his career. He was very much now the crown prince of British cinema, being called as such by the press, and he also knew that he couldn't really progress anymore in Britain. [Stone] In 1939, Hitch started a collaboration with David Selznick, the famous producer. Hitch had wanted to come to America. He was fascinated with America. So when Selznick offered Hitch the opportunity, he and Alma and Pat moved to America. [Mankiewicz] When Hitchcock comes from England to the States, he tells Selznick he's not coming without Joan Harrison. She's part of that deal. [Roche] When Hitchcock arrived in America, he was surprised, I think, to find that people knew who he was. He already had a presence there. I mean, I know he had films that had been out, but I don't think anyone, even Hitchcock himself, expected them to be the hits that they were. He very much felt straight away that, "Wow, I've made it." [Lane] Hitchcock and Joan were working on adapting "Rebecca" for many months, and then the version that they tum into David O. Selznick, which they were very proud of, turns out to be a disaster, in Selznick's mind. [Roche] In response, Hitchcock got a memo back that was about three times the size of the script he'd handed in, with directions to the minutest detail of everything that had to be changed. [Landis] David O. Selznick was a very gifted filmmaker, but also a control freak. Everyone who worked for him went crazy. | mean, he was a very difficult guy to work for. [Roche] Hitchcock and Selznick, | think, butted heads, mainly because Hitchcock had a desperate need to control, as Selznick did. That stems from his fear of having his freedoms taken away. [Alfred Hitchcock] At a very tender age, | was frightened by a policeman. I'd been a bad boy. | don't remember now what it was I'd done, but my father sent me along to the police station with a note. They read the note and locked me in a cell and left me there for five minutes. I've been trying to escape from that cell ever since. [Landis] He said it was the most terrifying experience of his life. | think that's the key. I really do. [Roche] If you look at his entire body of work, the themes of losing control come through in almost every film he ever made. [Mankiewicz] On paper, signing a seven-year deal with David O. Selznick seems like a great deal. This is the guy who made "Gone With the Wind." In reality, Hitchcock had more artistic freedom in England than he did in the States working for David O. Selznick. [Tippi Hedren] The studio wanted the final cut, and Hitch said no, and they said yes, and he said no, and they- they won. So what he did was he shot an edited film, so that there was no other way that they could change it, and he knew what he wanted, so that's all he shot. It's brilliant filmmaking, totally brilliant. [announcer] Announcing the most glamorous motion picture ever made, David O. Selznick and Alfred Hitchcock bring you the grand-slam prize-winner that made motion-picture history. [Roche] "Rebecca” was a huge hit. People rushed to see I, and they weren't disappointed. It's rightfully regarded as a masterwork. Hitchcock was nominated for Best Director, but lost out, but the film won for Best Picture, and, of course, when the Best Picture is awarded, it's not to the director, I's to the producers. On behalf of the Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, | present you this Oscar for your wonderful production of "Rebecca,” which you so beautifully produced, as well as you did "Gone With the Wind." Thank you very much. [Roche] The fact that Selznick was up there receiving an Academy Award for it was hugely disappointing. It was then that people began to say, "Well, you know, maybe Hitchcock could come and work for me?" And Selznick saw that as a huge opportunity for them both, because if people could guarantee him an income, then fine, you go and make films for them, and I'll let you argue with those people. [Alfred Hitchcock] The salary I was getting then for a picture was $75,000 from Selznick. [woman speaking in French] He received from Universal, for my services, $183,000. Nice profit, huh? [gunfire roaring] [announcer] These are not Hollywood sound effects. This is the music they play every night in London—- the symphony of war. [Patricia Hitchcock] In 1939, in September, war was declared, and my father was devastated, because his mother was in England. | remember him frying to get a call through, and the operator saying, "There are no calls to that country because it is at war,” and he was devastated. [Roche] Because America wasn't officially in the war yet, Hitchcock was being told by people around him that he should do something towards the war effort. The Hollywood contingent, they were all drifting back to Europe to join the fight, but Hitchcock remained, and because he did, he was fairly lambasted by everyone in Britain, who saw him as kind of a deserter. [Alfred Hitchcock] / needed at least to make some contribution. There wasn't any question of military service. I was both over-age and overweight. [Roche] He saw this second condemnation of his actions as a personal insult, Hitchcock was doing his part for the war effort. [Mankiewicz] He was very willing to make movies that clearly demonstrated the threat posed by the Nazis, starting with "Foreign Correspondent,” where he worked to redo the ending to make the Nazi threat clear. Look at "Saboteur.” There's no question of what that message is, which is, "They're here. They can't be trusted. Keep your eyes open.” After "Saboteur,” Joan Harrison leaves Hitchcock to become an independent producer, She did not need Alfred Hitchcock to succeed. [Lane] Hitchcock often saw his writers and his actors as his own. He took a possessive attitude toward them, and this is one thing that Joan would absolutely refuse. She wanted to be her own woman. [Mankiewicz] I think I's really easy to say that he was both drawn to these powerful, independent women, but he was also angry that women held this power over him, [Ann Todd] He wanted so much to be like the stars he was directing. | mean, a Cary Grant or... When he was directing, you could tell he was in it. It gave him a feeling of great domination, I think, because, after all, he couldn't take part in life, really, the way that he wanted to do, but when he was directing, he was dominating people and living it. [Roche] Hitchcock was essentially looking for ways to express all of these feelings in his work at the time. [Landis] What "Shadow of a Doubt” is about is Americana, white-picket fence, lovely lawn, and evil in plain sight. [Teresa Wright] He was very intrigued by the combination of the innocence of the small American town, as against the corruption of the uncle's life. [Landis] What's interesting is how profoundly terrifying the villain is. | mean, Joe Cotten plays a psychopath. Your favorite uncle is a serial killer, and he's in your house, and he knows you know. That's profoundly disturbing. Cities are full of women-- Middle-aged widows, husbands dead, husbands who've spent their lives making fortunes, working and working, and then they die, and leave their money to their wives—- their silly wives-- And what do the wives do-- these useless women? You see them in the hotels, the best hotels, every day by thousands, drinking the money, eating the money, losing the money at bridge, playing all day and all night, smelling of money... proud of their jewelry but of nothing else. Horrible. Faded, fat, greedy women. [Alfred Hitchcock] Our evil and our good are getting closer together today, that the hero is no longer fall, with a perfect profile, or flaxen hair, and the villain doesn't kick the dog anymore. He's a charmer. In fact, we've reached the point, in today's sophisticated era, that you can barely tell one from the other. Goodbye. [Mankiewicz] "Shadow of a Doubt" shatters America's vision of itself. There's a darkness to small-town America, and, clearly, Hitchcock loved turning the American ideal of itself on its head. After he finishes "Shadow of a Doubt" at the end of 1942, he gets horrible news. [Roche] His mother, who refused to come and live with him in America, even though he'd repeatedly tried to get her to come out, was falling sick. Emma Hitchcock was the ultimate authority in Alfred Hitchcock's life. She used to punish him by making him stand at the foot of her bed as she slept for hours on end. Physical punishment was very much paired with psychological punishment. Hitchcock adored his mother, but because she was such a strict authoritarian, it was tempered a lot with a great awe for his mother and for mothers in general. It's one of the reasons they pop up so much in his work. Well, a boy's best friend is his mother. Hitchcock was greatly affected by the loss of his mother. | don't think he ever really truly recovered, but it also made him realize that he was mortal, and needed to recognize the fact that people can be gone in the snap of a finger. The feeling that he should not waste his time on earth led him to start taking better care of his body. Actually, this is my doctor's idea. When he says "strict dist,” he means strict diet. [Roche] I think it almost caused a maturity in him. [Patricia Hitchcock] He would go on so many diets, and he had suits in the closet for every weight. He would fluctuate a great deal. [Roche] He did spend a long period during the '40s balloon dieting and fluctuating in weight. Especially when it got to "Lifeboat," he was very, very slimmed down. [Mankiewicz] Finally, he reaches the end of this seven-year deal with Selznick, where the best films he made were the ones that Selznick didn't produce. I'm not sure a great producer like Selznick should have been working with this visionary director like Hitchcock. Selznick wanted control. Hitchcock wanted control. There's a relationship doomed to fail. [Roche] When Hitchcock finally escaped from his contract, Selznick actually wanted to extend it, but by then Hitchcock was firmly set on partnering with Sidney Bernstein, so they set up Transatlantic Pictures. Hitchcock was now a producer. [Farley Granger] This was the first film he had done away from Selznick, who, evidently, he grew to loathe and despise, and so I think he wanted to do something, you know, quite different and interesting. [screaming] [Philippe] In "Rope,” the name of the person in the chest is David. | don't think it's a stretch to think that he actually put David O. Selznick in there. Open it. Hitchcock always experimented, and he always tried things that technology at the time couldn't do. "Rope" is an example of that, Of course. You know I'd never do anything unless I did it perfectly. I've always wished for more artistic talent. [James Stewart] He wanted to do the picture on one set, and he wanted to use the principle of the long take. He planned to shoot the picture so that the audience wouldn't be conscious of a cut. [Philippe] You couldn't have a single, continuous take of 80 minutes or 85 minutes, especially with the cameras that they were using at the time. [Roth] He's trying to challenge himself with, "How few cuts can I get away with? How can I just design a movie that's all about camera, so that I can hide editing?” You get much too upset much too easily, Phillip. We have a very simple excuse right here. Wheat are you worrying about, Phillip? After all, old Mr. Kentley is coming mainly fo look at these books. Now, what could be better than to have them laid out neatly on the dining-room table, where the poor old man can easily get at them? [Stewart] I found, after knowing Mr. Hitchcock for a very short time, that he has a way of presenting a problem to the technicians, which seems absolutely impossible, but he also has a way about him to convince all concerned that they can be done. [Philippe] There's this extraordinary moment when the dinner's over, everybody's worried because David is missing. The camera comes to a halt. You are now focusing on the chest as it's being cleared, and you hear the conversation off-screen. They're right there, 50 you know they're watching it. | thought I heard David on the phone to Phillip yesterday morning. Really? Yes, you did. I'd forgotten. [Philippe] We're waiting for somebody to open the chest, and oh, my gosh, we're going to see David's body, but this is a classic case of Hitchcock playing with us. Oh, thank you, Mr. Cadell. That's all right, Mrs. Wilson. You can put the books back when you come in to clean in the morning. [Arthur Laurents] One of the reasons that Hitch was interested in "Rope” was that he's interested in anything kinky. He was fascinated with homosexuality, because that was the subject. Though the word "homosexual” was never used, | thought it was quite obvious. Golly, those bull sessions you and Rupert used to have at school. Brandon would sit up to alt hours at the master's feet. Brandon at someone's feet? Who is this Rupert? [Lane] "Rope” brings up representations of homosexuality and shows that they're transgressive and suggests that they're criminal, but it was also doing things at the time that no one else was doing. The censors in classical Hollywood were regulating sexuality to keep allusions to lesbian, bisexual, gay, transgender representation off the screen, or to suggest that it was criminal. [Mankiewicz] Censorship in Hollywood set the industry back decades. They banned miscegenation. Think about that. You couldn't have a black character drawn to a white character. Forbidden. One thing I think we can say about Hitchcock is that he would have pushed the envelope on those stories if he'd been allowed to. [Roche] "Under Capricorn” was a film that was very important for Transatlantic. They needed it to succeed in order for the company to survive. One of Hitchcock's greatest friends, of course, was Ingrid Bergman, who he'd cast throughout the '40s, and when it came to "Under Capricorn," he was utterly convinced that her name and her star power could make it a success. He was also very taken with Ingrid Bergman. He was slightly obsessed with her. He had fallen in love with her. He'd even made up stories to people around the studio that, you know, she was in love with him, too, and that they were romantically involved. The problem was that the success of Transatlantic depended on "Under Capricorn” and Ingrid Bergman's name, and just as the film was being readied for release, she had an affair with Roberto Rossellini, ran off to Italy to be with him, leaving behind a husband and child, and was vilified by the American press. Her films were boycotted far and wide. 90% of the reason that that film was ignored by the public was because she was such a no-no at the time. Unfortunately, his partnership with Sidney Bernstein suffered, and Transatlantic Pictures died after just two films. [Edgar Wright] After that, he's off to the races. He is just making Alfred Hitchcock movies. He's not diluted by Hollywood, he's empowered by Hollywood, and he changes Hollywood. He is making state-of-the-art films in Hollywood, which are some of the best films made by any of those studios. [Spielberg] My favorite Hitchcock picture, which I think is the quintessential Hitchcock film, is "Rear Window". | mean, the idea that this guy who had a broken leg, Jimmy Stewart, you know, is stuck in a room during a sweltering summer, and he gets himself in a lot of trouble with his curiosity by snooping. [Alfred Hitchcock] A picture like "Rear Window," there's a piece of pure cinematics. Now, there are no galloping horses, no wild action, but a man sitting in one position for the whole picture, but look at its structure. He looks, he sees something, and he thinks, he reacts, and mentally, only by the use of film, by the use images, do you build up a conception in a man's mind that he's seen a murder. [Spielberg] Hitchcock was a declared voyeur, and so many of his films were just sort of scratching the surface of voyeurism, but "Rear Window" was the culmination of this desire to finally not be ashamed of it, and embrace it, and make the most entertaining movie of his career. Window shopper. | think one of the most suspenseful sequences in "Rear Window" is when Grace Kelly decides to go over there and investigate on her own. Hey-- You've got Jimmy Stewart not being able to cry out, because he's coming home, and she's stuck in his apartment, -Lisa! -Looking around. | mean, nothing beats that for suspense. [Philippe] It's so brilliant, this idea of containing the action of a film from the perspective of somebody who can't do a thing. [Lisa screaming] | think Grace Kelly is the purest expression of the classic Hitchcock blonds. The class, the beauty, the glamour. Do you like it? [Roche] When Hitchcock found Grace Kelly, he thought he'd found a partner for life. She famously even got on to such an extent with Alma that Alma always said that she was the one blonde she didn't mind leaving her husband with. He had big plans for his future productions with her. [news announcer] Prince Rainier's yacht bears his betrothed in triumph into the harbor at Monaco. A few hours earlier, Grace Kelly of Philadelphia and Hollywood stepped aboard the "Deo Juvante” from the finer "Constitution", which carried her across the Atlantic. A picture queen who will become a princess greets her new subjects and is greeted by them in tum. [Roche] Her movie career was cut short by the fact that she became the princess of Monaco. She followed her heart and left acting altogether. He was very disappointed by that. How do you top Grace Kelly? But when asked about it, he did say that she's finally found a part that's worthy of her. In the wake of the success of the films with Grace Kelly, Hitchcock was casting around for a replacement for her. He found Vera Miles, and he was very taken with her and thought perhaps he could turn her from kind of a homespun beauty into another Grace Kelly. So he set about trying to transform her. He advised her on what to wear, who she should be seen with, where she should be seen, how she should act, but his big plans for her were to be part of "Vertigo," but Vera Miles made the cardinal sin of getting pregnant, which she kind of saw as the only way to escape his control at the time, because he was 50 overbearing with her that even her husband was starting to get worried. [Alfred Hitchcock] | had Vera Miles tested and costumed. We were ready to go with her. She went pregnant, but ! lost interest then. | couldn't get the, uh, the rhythm going again. Silly girl. [Roche] The thing is, you see almost that story of how he treated Vera Miles come to life in "Vertigo". Now, we'd like to look at a dinner dress, an evening dress, short, black, with long sleeves, and a kind of a square neck. Scotty... My, you certainly do know what you want, sir. [Roche] You see a woman being remodeled by a man who's desperate to recreate the thing he's lost. You're sure about the color of the hair? Oh, yes. If's an easy color. I mean, all the rest of the... Yes, sir. We know what you want. Thank you. In many ways, if it had been Vera Miles onscreen instead of Kim Novak, it would have been a sick joke too many. [William Friedkin] "Vertigo" is one of the most complex of Hitchcock's films. It's about someone who falls so in love with a character that after he knows she's dead, he believes her to be alive. [Alfred Hitchcock] The sick psychological side is you have a man creating a sex image that he can't go to bed with her until he's got her back, or, metaphorically indulged in a form of necrophilia. [Martin Scorsese] We thought it was good. We didn't know why, but there was something special about it, and over the years, we kept watching it again and again, and I think it has to do with the character. The story doesn't matter at all. You'll watch that film repeatedly and repeatedly because of the way he takes you through his obsession, and the kind of man he is in that film. Maybe it's Hitchcock's obsession. It seems that Jimmy Stewart understood it pretty well. [Edgar Wright] The act of watching "Vertigo" is a lot like watching Stewart watching Novak in the gallery, is you just want to look at it, and to see if there are further secrets that will reveal themselves to you. It is a film to get lost in, as much as James Stewart gets lost in the sort of the riddle of the case. [Philippe] Halfway through the film, the Kim Novak character dies. [screaming] At that point, the major dramatic question of the film is will they end up together. So you're removing the major dramatic question. You're removing the love interest, and you enter this very strange act, where Jimmy Stewart can't speak anymore. He is in a state of shock. | mean, quite frankly, you have no story, and you've got nothing until she shows up again, and at that point, you go, "Wait a minute. Is this a ghost story? Is this woman one and the same? Are we in the mind of a crazy guy?" | mean, what is this movie? Like, you don't even know what it is that you're watching. You don't know the genre of the film until much later on, you see the necklace, you connect the dots, and you go, "Okay, now I understand where this is going," and at that point, it's completely heartbreaking. You shouldn't have been... You shouldn't have been that sentimental. I loved you so, Madeleine. [Alfred Hitchcock] "Vertigo" will break even. I wasn't a big success. I think the leading man was a problem in "Vertigo." [interviewer] You once fold me that actors were cattle fo be shoved about. | wonder if you'd care to enfarge on that. You mean you want fo make them larger cattle than they are? No, no. Well, uh, I don't- that's really a joke, but, um, they're children, you know, and, invariably, the problem one always has with actors is coping with their ego, but they have to have the ego, and they have to be ultra-sensitive, otherwise they wouldn't be able to do what they're-- What they're... is asked of them. [James Steward] When you work with Hitch, you don't try doing a scene two ways. You do it one way-His. [Kim Novak] At times, there were scenes that he had in the background a metronome. Is that what you call it? One of those going back and forth to carry the tempo of the scene. Instead of trying to reach me on an emotional level that would gear me to whatever level of pace or whatever that he wanted, he liked doing it technically. Everything he thought of, he saw through the camera. Everything. [Thom Mount] Actors didn't love Mr. Hitchcock, but they loved being in his films, because, of course, he got great performances out of people, but he also boosted their careers in ways that were extraordinary. [Janet Leigh] He said to me, "I am not going to do a great deal of directing unless you don't do enough or you do too much.” What he did was give you more respect as an actor or an actress, because he is saying, "You create your reasons, because that's the way it has to be." [Mankiewicz] His best line about actors is when he says, "When an actor comes to me and wants to discuss his character, | say, 'Is in the script. When the actor then says, 'What's my motivation?" Hitchcock says, "Your salary. America in the 1950s was in the middle of the greatest economic boom in its history. Hitchcock finds his stride, makes the best movies of his career, certainly the best-known movies of his career. There are all these changes happening in America in the 1950s, and one of the most important, just with the exception of the civil rights movement and the dawn of the nuclear age, is television, the power of television, but also the opportunity. Alfred Hitchcock, thanks to his agent, Lew Wasserman, instantly saw that there was a part for Hitchcock to play on television, both figuratively and literally, and Hitchcock embraced it. Good evening. | am Alfred Hitchcock, and tonight I am presenting the first in a series of stories of suspense and mystery called, oddly enough, "Alfred Hitchcock Presents.” [Norman Lloyd] MCA sold the idea of Hitchcock doing a series, and it was Lew Wasserman who said to Hitchcock, "Joan Harrison should be your associate producer.” [Lane] Joan comes onto "Alfred Hitchcock Presents” series. She's essentially what we know of today as a showrunner, and she's doing everything for that series. Our particular kind of television film is not as easy to make as people would sometimes think, because it's not just a simple crime thing. It also has to be a study in character. [Roche] As an anthology show, each tale, usually a suspense tale, ends with a nasty twist. [man] Jackie! [mirror shatters] [Roth] There are so many indelible images that were burned into my mind, from the body in the trunk, to the rear blinker going out, to the Steve McQueen episode with Peter Lorre, the image of her pinkie and her thumb picking up the keys. It was the craziest thing I had ever seen on television. [Roche] He oversaw production on most of them, directed a few of them, but the hook that audiences just loved were the fact that Mr. Hitchcock showed up every episode at the beginning and lampooned himself. Oh, good evening, fadlies and gentlemen. Oh, good evening. Oh, good evening! I was, uh, just constructing a mobile for my living room. Good evening. Good evening, fadlies and gentlemen. [Roche] Lampooned the fact that TV shows had sponsors. I'm afraid I said some nasty things about commercials. [Roche] At first, the sponsors were very, very against that. They pushed back a lot. "We don't want to be, you know, a figure of fun. You know, we're paying for your show to be mads.” When they saw their sales skyrocketing, they knew that they should have listened. But first, we have an important announcement, My sponsor-- The way he bows and scrapes before the sponsor, it's disgusting. He's obviously a relative. Shh. ...And expensive message. [Roche] Over the course of the show, they got to see his sense of humor, and they just took him to their hearts. [interviewer] | have a strong impression that the real Alfred Hitchcock is not at all like the macabre and mischievous gentleman on the TV screen. No, of course not. [gunshot] It was all make-believe, all play-acting. Of course, the gun is genuine, and was loaded, but the doctor isn't a real doctor. He's an actor. [Roth] Alfred Hitchcock became famous from his television show at a time when there were probably three networks. At the very, very beginning of the medium, there he is, on camera, in everyone's living room. [Stone] He was wonderful when people acknowledged him and asked for autographs. | asked him at one point, "Doesn't it ever bother you, these people bothering you during dinnertime?" And he said, "No, because these are the people that are paying for your dinner." [Ramsey] He saw that people were responding to the TV show in a way that they hadn't responded to the films. He saw that people who responded to the TV show were different from the people who were responding to the films, and he asked himself, "What about them? What can I do for them?" And that was what gave rise to "Psycho." "Psycho" is based in part on the story of the mass murderer Ed Gein. Robert Bloch, the author of the original book "Psycho," lived near where Ed Gein's activities had taken place. He knew these hints of the horror of Ed Gein, and he knit those into this remarkable novel with this twist ending that just bowled people over in its time. Hitchcock wanted to make it because he knew it was time for something else, but the studios, they weren't interested in it. [Philippe] Most people told him, "Don't do it, it's beneath you," especially coming out of "North by Northwest,” which is this grand picture, Technicolor, movie stars. It's fun. It's just a beautiful, accessible film... ...and then he wants to make this weird pulp novel that's really, really dark and really messed up. [Joseph Stefano] First thing that Hitch said to me was there's a company that's making pictures for about $250,000. What if we did that? What if somebody of his caliber directed one of these low-budget movies? And he told me that he had intended to do "Psycho” for under a million dollars. [Philippe] The gamble for him was, "Okay, fine. Well, I'm gonna mostly finance it myself. I'm gonna take a TV crew, and we're gonna shoot it in black and white, and we're gonna do this thing.” And I think that's what gives "Psycho” its quality. | was on set exactly if I had been on the anthologies. We were just assigned to "Psycho,” and we went to work the same as we did every other day, but we were just beginning to work with a master and a very different kind of black-and-white project, too, in the middle of Technicolor. [Alfred Hitchcock] I did use a television unit, and we did work pretty fast, but when it came to certain things that were cinematic, then I slowed up to the feature-film rate, 45 seconds of film, 70 setups, and I took seven days to do it. [Philippe] The shower scene in "Psycho” is what I would call the Mona Lisa of movie scenes. It's really something you could put in a museum. Everything he has ever done throughout his entire career has always led up to the shower scene. [piercing music plays] [screams] [screams] [piercing music plays] [screams] [Leigh] I had no idea of the impact of the shower scene when I was doing it. | knew each scene had an impact, but the total effect | didn't get until I actually saw it, because then I saw what he had envisioned all along, which was each cut of the film was the slice of the knife. [Philippe] Our brains at the time, we were not used to this kind of fast-paced editing, and what he does that I think is so absolutely brilliant is that if you look at POV in the shower scene, in certain shots, you're the victim, you are the murderer, you are the voyeur, you are the spectator, you are the eye of God, and you are also Hitchcock the auteur, and so all of this happens in a very, very quick 45 seconds. He essentially splits your personality into multiple points of view in a very short amount of time, and he tums you into the psycho. One thing about Hitchcock is that he always found a way to do what he wanted to do, and it's a bit of a mystery sometimes how he got around censorship. [Ramsey] This was an era when two characters in bed were usually in separate beds. There was no sex in movies in those days, and there wasn't even the impression that there might conceivably be sex in movies. The censors at that time weren't ready for the experience "Psycho" was going to invite them to. Some were convinced in the shower scene that they saw nudity. Others were convinced that there was no nudity. So they sent it back to Hitchcock, and they said, "Take out the nudity." Hitchcock took the reels, made no changes, sent the reels back, and said, "Fixed." They took another look at the film. This time, the people who thought they had seen nudity the first time saw none. The people who thought they saw no nudity the first time were convinced that there was nudity. They sent it back to Hitchcock. "Please take out the nudity." Again, Hitchcock did nothing. He sent it back. This time, they were satisfied. No nudity. [Roth] What Hitchcock did that was so genius was he doesn't actually show anything, and shooting in black and white, he can get away with the blood. [Alfred Hitchcock] Once in the street, a little boy came up to me and said, "Mr. Hitchcock, in that murder scene in Psycho,' what did you use for blood? Chicken blood?" | said, "No, chocolate sauce.” "Okay." And he went on his way. See, the operative phrase was, "What did you use for blood?" He didn't believe it. [Philippe] It's an extraordinary piece of work. It's also a very problematic piece of work. It completely changed cinema. | mean, it brought in the slasher film, and a wave of violence, of helpless women being assaulted in private spaces. We still see the ripple effect of the shower scene today. [Ramsey] By the time he finished it, by the time it was in the can, by the time it was ready to go, no one had more doubts about it than Hitchcock himself. He actually contemplated breaking it up into 30-minute segments and running it as part of his television show. He was terrified of what audiences would say. He was terrified of what film critics would say. All his doubts were resolved when the audiences started lining up around the block to see the movie, and the minute they finished it, they would go and line up around the block again. [Alfred Hitchcock] My main satisfaction is that film could make an audience scream. [screaming] [piercing music plays] [interviewer] So you don't really feel that sociologists have much of a foundation for saying that films that record the criminal impulse, or television shows that concentrate on crime, have a lasting influence on the viewer? | would say it had an influence on sick minds, but not on healthy minds. [Roth] As a director, there's so much pressure to follow up a hit. You had this vision. You fought for it. You won the battle. You got it into cinemas, and it's a hit, and everyone made money, and people love it, and they're calling it the best film of your career, and then what do you do after that? How do you do? My name is Alfred Hitchcock, and I would like to tell you about my forthcoming lecture. It is about the birds and their age-long relationship with man. [Philippe] There's no such thing, really, as a faithful adaptation of a source material by Hitchcock. He was known for reading the book once, and when he finds the one thing that excites him about a story, he will work with a writer and go in that particular direction, and, essentially, throw the original material away. [Evan Hunter] One of the first things he told me on the phone was we're getting rid of the du Maurier story entirely. We're just keeping the title and the notion of birds attacking people. [Roth] "The Birds," really, is about the randomness of life. Aren't those lovebirds? You meet this girl. She meets this guy. They're in this town. Everything's fine, and then out of nowhere, the birds just start invading. [birds shrieking] "The Birds" is an intense movie, and the violence in that movie is intense, and it is relentless, and it is against children, it's against women, it's against people that are just helplessly attacked by birds for no reason and get their eyes pecked out. | mean, if's brutal. [birds shrieking] [Hunter] Whenever we were discussing this, there was no question in either of our minds that this was Cary Grant and Grace Kelly. He said, "But why should | give Cary 50% of the movie?" And then he said, "The only stars in this movie, Evan, are the birds and me," and then he hesitated, and said, "And you, of course.” [announcer] Works slick as a whistle. [whistling] 7! Feel beter... I [Hedren] | had been doing commercials, and there was a commercial that I had done. It was a pet milk product called Seagull Dietary Drink. 7 With Seagull... 7 With Seagull [Alfred Hitchcock] | felt when I saw this little flash of her on the television screen that she had something. Now, I didn't see it once. This was a commercial, so I got a chance to look at this girl probably a half a dozen times, and it had an effect on me and I thought, "Well, I'd better send for her." [Hedren] | was asked to go to MCA, which is a huge talent agency. It was then that I was told that Alfred Hitchcock wanted to sign me to a contract, and he said, "Here is the contract. If you look it over and you agree with the terms and sign it, we'll go over to meet him.” So I was under contract to Alfred Hitchcock before I even met him. [Roche] He had signed her to a contract, a very long-term contract, exclusive to him, and began to fall into that pattern again of remolding, and suddenly, she was Alfred Hitchcock's new plaything. You can be honest. Whatever you feel about Hitch is perfectly all right, because we all know what he is. You know, mean, all that stuff. Yeah, mean and all that stuff. -You can say whatever you want. Well, possibly, I see a little different side of him. -You do? -Yeah. [Hedren] It went extremely well for months. You know, "The Birds” took six months to film. [Roche] As the process of filming "The Birds" went on, the dark side in him really came out. It climaxed, of course, with the filming of the bird attack. Originally, the attack was supposed to be performed with mechanical birds. When it came time to shoot it, she arrived on set and found cages of real birds, and asked what was happening. The only excuse she got was that they didn't look real enough. [Hedren] There was no intention of using mechanical birds. They had built a cage out of chain-link fencing, with the door that I come in. [gasps] [screams, gasps] [Hunter] They were throwing birds at her. She was being attacked. She was visibly crumbling under the assault of the birds. [Roche] Cary Grant visited the set while this was going on, saw what was happening, and he'd only been there two minutes, and he said, "What the hell are you doing to this poor girl?" [Roth] Tippi Hedren shot that attic scene for a week. Your body doesn't know you're acting, so even though you can tell yourself it's fake, when you scream and act terrified and cry, it affects you emotionally. [Alfred Hitchcock] The great French playwright, Sardou, he said, "Torture the woman," as a piece of dramatic, and the trouble is today, uh, we don't torture the women enough. [laughter] [announcer] At Universal City in California, they prepare for the start of a unique pigeon derby across the U.S. The official starters are director Alfred Hitchcock and Tippi Hedren, who is being introduced fo theatre-goers in Mr. Hitchcock's "The Birds". [Roche] Tippi Hedren had to come out of filming "The Birds," where she'd had this experience, and somehow pull herself together for a lengthy press tour in which she was introduced as Mr. Hitchcock's new blonde. After "The Birds," "Mamie" was the next film that Hitchcock had. He originally was going to get Grace Kelly back, but that didn't work out, 50, of course, the job fell to Tippi Hedren. If you were Tippi Hedren, what were you going to be expecting for your next film? [Philippe] You look at his later films, and they're quite sad. He raises the stakes on the violation of the woman from movie to movie to movie. It becomes a little bit disturbing, getting into "Marnie," where there seems to be more and more of a bitterness from Hitchcock that he could never have those women. [Roche] Obviously, he said something or did something during production that caused her to say, "Enough's enough.” The only people that really know are Alfred and Tippi themselves. When filming wrapped, Hitchcock called his crew, including his cast, and said, "Congratulations, job well done,” and as he was looking out over the faces, he saw Tippi Hedren walking towards the exit. That was the last time he ever directed her. Post-"Mamie," | think Hitchcock's reputation was starting to suffer. "Mamie" wasn't the hit that he needed it o be, and the tales of his mistreatment of Tippi Hedren were beginning to filter out into Hollywood. He was desperately trying to reinvent himself at this point, because he was Alfred Hitchcock, he still had the star power, and he felt that if he gave cinema a huge jolt again, that he could be back on top. [Mankiewicz] Hitchcock said the four things that scared him most were small children, policemen, high places, and that my next movie will not be as good as the last one. [Roche] After the relative disappointments of films like "Torn Curtain” and "Topaz," | think they were less inclined to suddenly just sign off on things for him anymore. [Roth] You can imagine that Hitchcock at a certain point just got tired. You know, you need energy to do this. You have to be up 2400 in the morning, 5:00 in the morning, day after day, on location. Though when Hitchcock is younger, he's making two movies a year, but as he gets older, he's kind of slowing down and taking a breath. [Ramsey] The biggest challenge that Hitchcock had after "Psycho” was how to follow up something so massive. In fact, he was never able to put that lightning in a bottle again, and it was a tremendous frustration to him, because people would always evaluate everything he did according to his peak box office, and nothing ever quite compared. [Lane] Hitchcock's career may have been waning, but in the 1970s, there's this new appreciation for his work that suddenly rises. [Stone] A lot of it started with film school. The USC Film School started a class about him. Then there were retrospectives on his old films. Everyone was studying him. Everyone was studying his films, and a lot of film theorists look way too deep into his films. When I was in college, | took a film class. It was all about Hitchcock. It came time to take the final, and you had to write about your favorite Hitchcock film, and I knew his was "Shadow of a Doubt.” [woman] They're alive, they're human beings. He helped me write a paper on "Shadow of a Doubt," and I handed it in, and I got a "C" on the paper, so I took it over to him, and I said, "Do you remember the paper that you helped me write?" | said, "Well, Igota'C'onit" and he said, "“Well, I'm very sorry, but that's the very best I can do." [Mount] He had transcended into god-like status in Hollywood. Lots of people become famous and have big careers, and then they go away. Mr. Hitchcock was exactly the opposite. He loved pushing the edge. He was really frying to respond to what he saw as an audience interest in violence that was new and unparalleled at that time, and I think that's largely true. He was very interested in where things were going in a kind of psychosexual context. [Landis] The '70s is a wonderful time in American movies, because things really loosened up. What's really interesting is when he made "Frenzy,” because now if's the time of slasher movies... [screams] It's not an old man's movie in any way. | think people were quite taken aback by it. [Edgar Wright] "Frenzy," which is his first film in London since the '50s, is one of his best movies. It's not uncontroversial, because I think some people see it as being kind of bleak and nasty. [Alfred Hitchcock] People think that one is a monster, and they relate me to my material. [Roche] I think "Frenzy," as well as being this bookend to a career—- You had "The Lodger" at one end, which was the thriller that started it, and "Frenzy," | would argue, is the thriller that it ends on. It was almost like a homecoming and a farewell tour for Alfred Hitchcock. He was confronted with places like Covent Garden, where he'd grown up. A greengrocer came up to him whits he was walking through the location, and said, " remember you as a boy," and Hitchcock was dumbfounded by the fact this ancient gentleman had just reminded him so much that he did grow up here. [Carrubba] When he was in England shooting "Frenzy," my grandmother had suffered a stroke. When she started getting ill, you know, he was losing his partner, his life partner, the only woman he ever loved. [Roche] I think he very much felt his mortality at that point, because he was getting old himself. After that, his pain became much worse. Alma's mobility became much worse, and I think without her constant energy and vitality, his need to make films slowly became less vital to him. [Mankiewicz] "Frenzy" comes out in 1972, Hitchcock's 73. It's pretty good, and everybody considers it his last film. Then four years later, he makes "Family Plot". The blue car's gone that way. Has it gone that way? That'll be nothing. Therefore, it must have gone over the edge. Okay, go again. [Mount] I think he felt "Family Plot" was a weak film relative to what he could do or his ambitions for it. He wanted to do something that was darker, scarier, and fresher. [Mankiewicz] Not easy for Alfred Hitchcock films to compete in the most important 10-year period of American movies, 1967 to 1976. [Ramsey] He could feel the times changing. He could feel a new generation of filmmakers, the Scorseses, the Spielbergs, the Lucases, and the work they were making, that work was filling theatres. [Mankiewicz] These were realistic stories, gritty stories, uncomfortable stories. They weren't Hitchcock stories, but they were borrowing from the Hitchcock formula. They either heard or read the Truffaut interviews. They knew at this time how vitally important Hitchcock was, and they knew Hitchcock could teach them a thing or two or eight about how to make movies. [Roche] After "Family Plot,” he tried to make "The Short Night" And when he realized that he just wasn't going to have the energy to get that made, he said, "You know, let's just be happy. Let's not try to kill ourselves prematurely. Let's enjoy the time we have." So he essentially retired and spent the next few years just with Alma at their home and lived the life of not Alfred Hitchcock the world-renowned entertainer and filmmaker, but they were Alfred and Alma, the two old folks. When you consider the work he put into the world, the fact that he never got a best-director Oscar is ridiculous. [Stone] He was nominated five times. He would have loved to have won an Academy Award, and he did feel a little cheated that he didn't. [Mankiewicz] The 1968 honorary Oscar was a big deal, but even bigger turned out to be the Life Achievement Award from the AFl in 1979. [man] This is the highest honor one can receive for a career in motion pictures-- The American Film Institute's Lifetime Achievement Award. [Roche] Everyone was there. It was the night that Hollywood came together. In fact, they said that, you know, if a bomb had gone off in that room that night that the industry would have shut down. When you consider the names that were in front of him-- | mean, you had Cary Grant there, who sat next to him. Ingrid Bergman presented it, famously without a script. Congratulations to the American Film Institute, who tonight acknowledge what our audiences have known for 50 years, that Alfred Hitchcock is an adorable genius. [applause] [Roche] It was him getting to sit with the people that had made him such a success, it was him getting to hear from the people that he'd nurtured, and loved, and created with, and despite all those names he had there, and he chose to thank just four people. [Alfred Hitchcock] First of all is a film editor, the second is a script writer, the third is the mother of my daughter, Pat, and the fourth is as fine a cook that ever performed miracles in a domestic kitchen, and their names are Alma Reville. [applause] | think that we have once more pointed out that behind every great man there is a woman, 50, men, watch out. [Roche] The biggest misconception about Hitchcock is that he was a director, or that he was a monster, or that he was a showman. He was all of those things, and he was 50 much more than that. He was human, and he wasn't afraid to show it. [Mankiewicz] We're not going to stop watching "Rear Window" and "Vertigo” and "Psycho” because of a re-examination of how he treated actresses... Turn out the light. He's seen us. ...But it's okay to re-examine Hitchcock as a man. In fact, it's not merely okay. It's vitally important.
