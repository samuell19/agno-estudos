(dramatic music) (people shouting) (loud crashing) (guns banging) (men shouting) (horse whinnying) (guns banging) (men shouting) - Mexico is not like it used to be. (guns banging) - You are quite right, I do hate the rich, but I hate the church even more and I want the American people to know that. You tell them. - I'd also like to tell them why, General. - Because of what they together have done to the poor. But they were payouts and they worked themselves to death for the rich. Or they throw us a double to us every now and then, but they can't go to the church. You know why, gentlemen? To keep the people drugged with all their mumbo jumbo and afraid, always afraid! But it is the end of all that. Today, a fresh wind is blowing through my country. No more rich, no more church! Is that clear, Mr. Weiler? - Yes General, quite clear. Why do you let your soldiers terrify the people the way they do? - Terrify? We do not terrify. Ooh, I do feel that we must find the people in a different way, a way to make them not afraid of the church. Listen to me, my friend. Soon, my blessing will be more important to them than the priests. - But General... - You see, because I am a soldier, I like killing, but it has to be done. Do you think the rich would willingly give one tiny little bit of their gold to the poor? (laughing) Do you think the church would willingly loosen its grip on the people? No! Right now, in out of the way places, they still train stupid men to be priests with the help of the rich, but my men will get around to them all. They have their orders, gentlemen, they have their orders.

Oh, it is a dangerous time to be a priest. - Oh Father, I don't mean that. I mean I'm afraid I am not right to be a priest. To work, to study, don't look easy. I need to find dignity. I feel more at home along the binders where I come from. My hands, they are not the hands of a priest. You see the hands of a... - Miguel, it is not a question of the hands, it's a matter of the heart. (horse hooves thundering) Soldiers, Miguel! (guns banging) Quick, warn the guards, go! Quickly!

You'd better take the back road to Concepcion. - Thank you, I will. You have been so good to me. - For a priest, nothing is too good. - But I haven't the priest yet. Now one more favor to ask. - Anything, Brother Miguel. - Trade your suit for mine. - But yours is like new. Ormando's is old, it's not even a suit. - That's why I like it, to get home safe. - How would I walk in such a fine suit? - And the hat too, please. (silly music) - If you say so, Brother Miguel. (silly music) - Can you recognize me, huh? (soft music) (birds chirping) - Go in peace, Brother Miguel and don't forget, you are not alone. - Goodbye and thank you very much again. (soft music) (silly music) Armando was right, I'm not alone. (melodic whistling) - [Man] Good morning, Ormando. (children shouting) (dog barking) (loud knocking) - What do you want? - Your son! - My son is away, out of the country. - [Miguel] I was told he just came back. - No, you have made a mistake. - Mama, mama it's me, Coco, (speaks in Spanish)! Mama! (Miguel and Mama laughing) ♪ A little wine or brandy ♪ ♪ And some of my good son, ah ♪ (all laughing) (loud knocking) - Yes, who is there? - [Luis] My name is Luis Vilches. I have a private letter for someone in this house. Will you open, please? - Put it under the door. - You sure it's all right? - Yes. - What is it, Humberto? - It's for you. - Miguel, is it important? - From the seminary, Mama. I'm supposed to meet somebody tomorrow morning in the plaza. - Who? - I'm not sure. - Does that mean you will go away again? - Don't go back, Miguel. It's too dangerous. - Stay with us. - How much I would love to, Anna. - Then do it! The League is going to fight El General. Even Roberto is helping. We need you more than the church does right now. - But I have already said I would be a priest. - It's a time for soldiers, Miguel. - I don't think I would make a good soldier. - Humberto, leave him alone. - You tell him what we learned yesterday. - They know the names of every priest and seminary student in all Mexico. - How long do you think it'll be before they're here looking for you? They have a special division of police whose only job is to find you! - Humberto, that's enough! - Do you know who's in charge of these special police? El General's pet bulldog, Marinos, Colonel Amandeo Marinos and he's everywhere. He goes from town to town, just to make sure his men never let up! - Humberto, that's enough! - All right, Mama, all right, but you know the danger he's in. Leave the church, Miguel. Stay here with us. - Humberto, I already said I would be a priest. - But you know with your heart you're not sure, so now is the time to stop! - I wish it was simple as that. You know what, I thought of a wonderful plan to worry ElGeneral. - Some sort of joke, I suppose! - I tell you what, thousands of colored balloons with funny pictures of El General on them all over the city! Big men like him don't like to be laughed at. - Balloons, it's cowardice! Bombs Mexico needs now, not balloons. All you can think of is to make a joke and all you want is to be a fat monsignor, feeding the pigeons in the plaza! - Well, I always liked pigeons. - You care nothing about Mexico or freedom. - I care so much about Mexico that I don't want it done your way. - Please, please. Please, my sons. Let us have peace, at least in our own family. Anna, some more coffee, please. - Humberto. - [Humberto] Coco. - [Miguel] Mama? - [Mama] Coco, come in a minute, my son. - [Miguel Yes, Mama. - You still doubt you can be a priest? - I'm afraid, Mama. - Afraid? - Oh, don't be shocked. At least I don't believe that I am afraid that maybe when I have a bullet hole in me I'll find out differently. - Do not joke about it, Miguel. - Mama, to be a priest is such a great thing. To celebrate mass, to forgive sins, that is to stand in the place of God, me. This is ridiculous! (soft music) - Do you think the good God doesn't know what he is doing? - I am sure that He does. That's why He has given me all these doubts. You see Mama, when the soldiers came to the (speaks in Spanish) I thought ah, God goes to all this trouble only to prevent Miguel from even thinking that he should become a priest. - Mexico is suffering now, my son. Maybe she needs a priest like you, men full of joy who can laugh and make others happy. God does not want only priests with long faces. - But how many people will be gone to heaven only because I played the guitar and I sing foolish songs? - You understand it is for you to make this decision. - Yes, Mama. - I wouldn't dream of trying to interfere. - No, Mama. - I only ask you to consider. I do not push. - Of course not, Mama. - Now go to bed and sleep. - Yes, Mama. (soft music) Let me say Mama, if God made his will as clearly as you made yours, I wouldn't have any problem. - Goodnight, Miguel. (soft music) (birds chirping) (townspeople chattering) - Paper? Paper! Eight reported dead, riots in Morelia, eight reported dead. Newspaper? Riots in Morelia, eight reported dead! Paper, senor? - No, thanks. (townspeople chattering) - Miguel Pro, keep looking up at the cathedral and listen to me. - Who are you? - A friend. I sent the message to you last night with Luis Vilches. Friday morning at 8:00 here, buy a paper from me. You'll take it and travel documents with instructions will be inside. You're to go to California to continue your studies. - You come from (faint speaking), but I don't even know. - But Father Rafi. - I'm not sure if I... Is counting on you. - But I still don't know. - I'll be here, Friday morning, eight o'clock. Riots in Morelia, riots in Morelia, riots in Morelia! (children shouting) (soft music) - [Miguel] To be a priest is such a great thing, to celebrate mass, to forgive sins, that is, to stand in the place of God, me. That's ridiculous. (dramatic music) (suspenseful music) (percussive music) - Don't you profane the House of God! Don't you profane the House of God! - Your excellency! - You (mumbles) yourself at the wrath of the Almighty! They will be destroyed! They will be destroyed, they will be blown like chaff before the wind! I am the majesty of the church! (gun banging) No! (gun banging) - [Soldier] Hey you, stop! - Let him go. - He might be a priest! - We got a bishop. That's good enough for one night. This is worth more than he is. (footsteps clacking) (somber music) (dramatic music) - (faint speaking) I've seen him. - I've seen him many times. With due respect to the dead, I don't think the bishop made life in Mexico easier. - I know, Humberto, but try to understand me. I must go. God called, I am sure now. - Paper, Senor? - Is this God coming here? - Paper, Senor? - Yes, please. (birds chirping) (townspeople chattering) - Good news, Senor, good news. - Thank you. - [Man] Paper, get your paper right here! (townspeople chattering) - Well? - Well. - Be careful, Humberto. - Let El General be killed. - There is no God! There is no power over us except what we feel and what we think. I believe in the power of men! Let Mexico believe in that, let Mexico believe in me! (loud explosions) (dramatic music) - Mr. Weiler? - Yes? - El General will see you now. - Thank you. (faint speaking) - Mr. Weiler of the New York Press. - How do you do, Mr. Weiler, how do you do? A pleasure. Oh, this is Colonel Marinos, head of my Special Police Force. Well, it's been quite a few years. - It's been a few years. - Sit down, sit down. You know, I am very flattered that you would return to my country. Let me ask you, do you find it changed? - Yes, quite changed. - Then you have seen how I have kept my promises to my people. The church no longer has its yoke around our necks and the people are free to think for themselves. - Do I have your permission to move around in your country? My readers would be very much interested to know how your people have taken to this new life you have made for them. - Of course, Mr. Weiler. You may go wherever you like and speak with whomever you please. Everyone in Mexico is free. I want your readers to know that. I also want them to know what a great thing we have accomplished here, how modern! Now Mexico will be strong. - I'd like to go into the smaller towns as well as the larger cities. Would that be all right? - You are free to go wherever you like. Oh, you might find a few priests hiding here and there like cockroaches, but because the people deny them, they are no longer of any importance. - That's exactly what I'd like to see for myself. Thank you for your kindness, General. - A pleasure. Oh, Mr. Weiler, perhaps you would like Colonel Marinos to arrange for you to be taken around? - No thanks, I'd rather do this on my own. (door closing) - Marinos? What will he find? - Nothing, nothing. Everything is as you said.

All I know is they were in trouble with the authorities, then, when the mother died... - What did you say? - I said the mother died. The others left soon after. - My mother! - That's all I can tell you. - Please, I don't know anymore.

Go get my wife and kids, then go get yours. - [Jose] My wife, but why? - Go! This man is a priest. - Father. - Robert, get your wife and bring all the others. Tell them to bring the children.

They received my message. - Why has it been so difficult to find them? - Just to be distantly related to a priest these days is dangerous enough, but to be his brother and sister, well, it's better not to be found by the police too easily. - Is that why. Humberto is in jail? - Father! They're coming now. - Louis! It's them! Anna, Roberto! - [Anna] Oh, Miguel! Oh, Miguel! - How wonderful (laughing). Now tell me, why is Humberto in jail? Is he in danger? - There's no real charge. They can't prove anything. - The lawyer from The League is trying to get him out. - But what did he do? - Remember your idea about the balloons? - That crazy joke that I said annoy El General? - Yes, well, Humberto decided that it was a good trick! - But how did they know who did it? - Without meaning to do any harm, people talk, Miguel. - Yes, I see. Have you been to Senor Alterez in Concepcion since you been here? - We were afraid it might mean trouble for her. - How terrible that my being a priest should bring danger to all who are close to me. What about Humberto? I must go to see him. - In jail, don't be foolish. - It's not safe, Miguel. - Don't worry, they don't know me. Mm-hmm. - Why are you doing that? - I might need it to see Humberto. I have been around as a plainclothes priest. Now I'm going to be a plainclothes policeman. - Has he had any visitors? - Just his lawyer and his brother Roberto and sister. - Try to keep him as long as you can. We have word that his brother, the priest, is back in Mexico City. - A priest, here? - He is sure to try to get word here to his brother. Then we'll have him. El General will be pleased. You know, Lerrera, it may mean a promotion for both of us when we capture him. - Thank you, Colonel. (silly music) (soft music) (silly music) - What are you reading there? - The regulations manual, sir. - Splendid, splendid. That's the spirit we want to see. Regulations must become second nature. Study is the only way to achieve it. - Yes sir, thank you, sir. - Now, prisoner Humberto Pro. - Humberto Pro? - Yes. - 116. It's that way. Shall I show you there? - No, you stick to your post. - Thank you, sir. Carlos? (silly music) - Good day. - Good day. - 116, the prisoner Pro. - But sir, I... - Let's keep the collar buttoned at all times. If it's too tight, move the bottom. It will relieve that. - Yes, sir. - [Miguel] Prisoner Pro, step over here. A few questions in reference to the balloon incident. - Dear Juan. If you want to know what's inside them, catch one. Coco! But what're you doing here? - Thinking how I can get you out. - But you can do nothing. Get out of here and fast! They know you're back. One of the officials here knows that from before. How was Lerrera? - There must be someone that I can contact. - The League's lawyer is doing all that he can. Leave well enough alone. Now get out of here! (suspenseful music) - I'll find some way to get you out. I'll come back. - No! It's too risky. - I'll find a way. - No! (dramatic music) - I'll come back tomorrow. I've had enough lies from you for today. - Good day, Inspector. - Good day, sir. (suspenseful music) - [Lerrera] Oh, Inspector, I'll see you out. - [Miguel] That's not at all necessary, but thank you anyway. - But I insist, Inspector. It's a small enough courtesy. Please allow me. Stop here and look out the window. May I see your credentials, Inspector? I am Carlos Lerrera, prison captain. You're very resourceful. I'm amazed that you would be so daring, Padre Pro. You were very foolish to come here. I was going to have to release your brother soon anyway. We don't have enough evidence to hold him much longer, but since you have come here, I'll release him much sooner than I have to, tomorrow morning, if you will do something for me. - I can do something for you? - Will you say mass for my family at my house tonight? My wife would be so happy with that and there will be others. - I would be so honored that I cannot even tell you. - Then at 10 o'clock tonight at this address. - Good of you to see me out, Captain Lerrera. It has been a great pleasure to be here with you today. I hope to see you soon again. - [Lerrera] Thank you very much. - [Miguel] Good day, good day. - [Man] These are the photos. - These are the last class of Miguel Pro's high school? - [Man] Yes, Colonel. The names are on the back. - Miguel Pro. Miguel Pro, priest. (suspenseful music) Yes, what is it? - It concerns Lerrera and a man who was supposed to be an inspector questioning Humberto Pro, the prisoner. - Humberto Pro. - You see, sir, after they talked, the next day, Humberto Pro was suddenly released. - Is this the man who said he was an inspector? - Which one, sir? - The one in the middle. Well? - Much younger, but I think that it's him. I think... - Think, think! Can't you be sure? - Yes, yes, I'm sure. - Good. - The Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, amen. Anibal, Luis, (faint speaking) the name. And the Holy Ghost, amen. - Father, there are soldiers on horseback. (birds chirping) - Children, come, come with me. Okay. And you like that. Let's see, sit down, uh-huh. You like mud pies? (children laughing) (Miguel mumbling) - [Soldier] Hey, you! - Me, Senor? - We heard there is a priest somewhere in the hills. Have you seen one? - I don't think so. What does a priest look like? - Don't you know what a priest looks like? - It's many years that we don't see one here. - All right, stupid. Go back to the filthy mud. - (speaks Spanish) Senor, you're very kind. (birds chirping) (horse hooves thundering) - I was afraid for you, Father. Do you want to wash the mud off? - Not now. Perhaps they will comeback, but something else is coming now. (car engine rumbling) What're you dong now? Humberto, where did you get this beautiful dusty old car? - The League gave it to us to help in our work, but why are you covered with mud? - I was only playing with the children. Goodbye. I will come back soon to see you again. Let's go now, quick! Maybe I can get some sleep while you drive. - Oh. (car engine rumbling) Miguel, a man asked me if you would say mass at a meeting Saturday night. He said 400 people would be there. I said 400 people cannot keep a secret and that you would not go. Now I can say I have asked you and you have not said yes. - I hope you have got the address. - You heard what I said? - I heard and the answer is yes! - Oh. (car engine rumbling) (upbeat music) (Miguel shouting) (upbeat music) I see you brought your band with you. - Well, Saturday night is a night for dances. It will sound like a dance, no? - It'll certainly not sound like holy mass. - It's going to be the loudest mass ever said. (Humberto and Miguel laughing) (upbeat music) (dramatic music) - How do you explain this? My brilliant, all knowing Amadeo Marinos, head of my special division. How do you explain this? How do you explain that one stupid little priest can defy me, that he can thumb his nose at me and hold a public mass without a single hint to my special police of what was going on? - But General. - What did you say when I asked you what that reporter, Mr. Weiler, would find? Huh, what did you say? So now I am made to look ridiculous in the eyes of everyone, isn't that right, Marinos? - No, General. - Yes, General! I want this to end right now. I want this miserable little priest caught and shot and shoot anyone who helps him! - Si, General. - And no one in your division is to rest, especially you, until this little bastard is caught. Is that clear? - Si, General. (people chattering) (Miguel shouting) - Ah, Aye, yi, yi, yi, yi, yi, yi! (speaking in Spanish) Aye, yi, yi, yi, yi, yi, yi, yi (singing in Spanish) (laughing) (audience applauds) (soft music) Oh, this is for you, Sister. I sold a few things. - I didn't know you were a salesman so well, Father. - Oh yes, you might even say a traveling salesman. Sister, have you been all right? - Yes, we are perfectly safe. They're not bothering us here at the orphanage. - I found a good home for these two. (soft music) Do you know what I think, Sister? We should be more generous and give them three. - Father, do you think that's right? - Of course, after all, how much more trouble are three than two? - If you only knew what you do for all of us, Father. It is like rain, your coming, like rain in a dusty summer. - This priest you said you were chasing, is this him? - It's hard to say, Colonel. It could be, but he was running like a squirrel. - You, look at it. - I can say, Colonel. - Get out! I want every place this priest ever lived checked, everyone he ever knew questioned. Is that clear? - Yes, Colonel. (dog barking) - You remember Senora Danner? - [Miguel] Of course. Have you heard from her? - She sent this note, wants you to come to see her. It sounds urgent. - In Concepcion? Oh, it will be good to see her again and maybe I can visit some of my friends. - Don be stupid, Miguel. Someone may recognize you. - I can use one of my false mustaches! - Stop being such a clown! (laughing) Do you remember the official who let me get out of jail? - Captain Lerrera? - Now he's in jail. - Because he freed you? - Because he let you get away. Can't you see, it's not only ourselves we endanger but all those who help us. Don't you realize, Miguel, all the people are not with us! There are many who are glad El General shoots priests. Whenever they see you, they run to the police. - Only a few, Humberto, only a few. - That's what you think. They offer them money, Miguel. Here, take my wine, too. You have many more masses to say. (soft music) - Miguel. - Eh? - Miguel Pro. - Miguel Pro? (silly music) Padre! - Shh! (soft music) Good day, Senorita. - What do you want? - I would like to see Senora Altera. - You would like that, huh? And you would like the senora to give you something like a little bit of money, huh? All you beggars think she has so much gold. She can't afford to keep on giving (mumbles) the likes of you. Well, let me tell you... - Nita, what's all the fussing down there? I can't do my sewing with that prattling going on. - It's me, senora! - And who are you? You sent for that you wanted to see me. - Miguel Pro! - Shh! - Nita, show him up quickly, quickly! - [Miguel] Thank you. - Senor? - Oh yes, thank you. - Miguel, my dear Miguel, you did come. Thank you! - For you, senora, any time, but pardon my appearance. - I understand. Come on. Nita, some coffee, please. Come, I want to hear all about you, your travels, the family, everything. Sit here. Oh, don't mind my work. I've been trying to repair this old dress. These days with this dreadful government, it's so hard to find anything decent. - Your letter said that you had an urgent matter for me. - Oh yes! A friend from Spain sent me a beautiful metal. I want you to bless it. - This is why you sent for me? - In the old days, it was so simple to have someone come up from the cathedral, but nowadays, well, we've been... Why do you look at me like that? - But senora, the lives of several friends were in danger to bring your message to me. - Endangered? - The penalty for harboring a priest is a severe one. - Oh, then I've done a terrible thing, haven't I? I didn't realize it. Can you forgive a foolish old woman, Miguel? (upbeat music) - Good afternoon, Senora. It's very pleasant here. This your home? - Why are you asking that? - Oh, permit me to present myself. I am Colonel Amadeo Marinos. - Go inside, go! I paid my taxes. Why do you come to arrest me? - Oh no, Senora. I'm not here about taxes, nor to arrest you, but I would like to ask... - Oh, but I don't know about any of those things. - Oh Senora, you are Margarita Polesko and this is your home. - Yes, but I wouldn't too sure for how long. My mother lives in Taxco and I may go and move in with her any minute if my husband brings ne more bottle of tequila in the house. - I came to ask you about a friend of yours, Miguel Pro. (dramatic music) - Miguel Pro? No, Miguel Tesada I know. He was fired last week from the factory where my husband works, if you can call whatever it is he does work. In my opinion... - I asked about Miguel Pro, he's a priest. - A priest? I thought it was illegal. It is illegal. - Ah, and so that's why you came here with those ruffians. (laughing) You think I'm a criminal and you came here to arrest me and... - Do you know where he is? - How should I know? It's obvious you don't have a husband like mine! - All right, senora, and if you happen to hear where he might be, let me know. There will be a little money in it for you. - Money? Why would I want money, so that my husband can buy more tequila and get drunker and drunker every night, is that what you want? - Okay, okay, Senora, good day. (door slamming) (laughing) - Manuelo, go quickly bar into the hacienda. If Padre Pro is there, tell him the police are looking for him. (suspenseful music) - That's good news about Roberto and Anna must be a big girl now. - Oh, she's beautiful. (loud knocking) - Senora Altera, where is she? - Siesta. - Get her immediately. - But, but oh no... - Immediately, I said! - No, I can't! (door slamming) - It's the police. What shall I do? - Try to delay them as long as possible. (loud knocking) - Senora Louisa, the police! - All right, Nita, all right. Go in there and stay out of sight! How dare you? You frightened my maid. What are you doing here? - Colonel Amadeo Marinos. - Hmm, behaving like mad dogs in the home of a respectable citizen. I'm reporting you to the mayor, you understand. - Will you please turn Miguel Pro over to me? - Pro? - Miguel Pro, I know he's here. - Have you taken leave of your senses? - A priest is an enemy of the state and we have information that he is in this house. - Without my knowing it? How absurd! - With your knowing it. So you force me to search for him then. (suspenseful music) Minas, look in that room. And you get the other one. Hurry up! - This is ridiculous. (upbeat music) - He's not there, sir. - All right, go check under the stairway. - There's nothing. Sir? - [Louisa] Now will you leave my house? I must have my siesta. I'm very tired. - The upstairs, if you please. - THe upstairs, of course. It would be interesting to know how you get your information. Follow me. (faint humming) - Colonel Marinos, this is my sister Amelia. She's hard of hearing. - Eh? - Melly dear, this is Colonel Marinos. He's come all the way from the city to pay us a nice visit. - Hmm? (faint humming) - Excuse me, Senora. (faint humming) - Well, Colonel? - It's possible a mistake was made, but if you are deceiving me. - Deceiving? You still think I may be hiding him somewhere perhaps. This really is preposterous. - Good day, Senora. (door slamming) (sighing) (door slamming) (car engine starting) - Oh, you frightened me out of my wits! You fooled them completely! (Louisa and Miguel laughing) - Oh, you were just marvelous. - Nevertheless, you should be angry with me. I'm a frivolous old woman who thinks getting a medal blessed is important. - Well, I've just been (mumbles) a woman myself. (Louisa laughing) Now, I'll try to come back and say mass for you and your neighbors. - Oh Father, would you? - Of course. And now I must find my way back to Mexico City. - So, it's happened again. We are told where he is, we arrive only minutes later, and he has disappeared like a puff of smoke, but the man is here, in Mexico City somewhere and I want every policeman to have a copy of this picture and I want you to memorize that face until you know it as well as you know El General's. And look everywhere, every street, every cantina, every shop. He must be caught, he must be caught! (birds chirping) (car engine rumbling) (horn honking) - Hey, you there! - Me, Senor? - Yes, you, Signor. - Humberto! (Humberto laughing) I hope this is my last shock for today. I thought you were the police again. Hello, Luis. - Hello, Miguel. - Have the police been after you? I told you not to do... - I came to visit. Senora Altera's sister, Melly. - Melly? I didn't know she had a sister. - Neither did she (laughing)! - Miguel, maybe someday I'll understand you. We better keep moving, but what are we gonna do about all of them? - Senora Altera was so generous. Can they come too? - All right, we'll put them in the backseat. Come Luis and help. (animals calling) - Come on, come on. Where does your friend go? - He is going to help an old man on the farm. Ooh, you have an intelligent face, my friend. (donkey braying) He's going to make a good farmer. - Now that we got rid of all that stuff, what do you do now? - What do we do, you mean? - All right, what do we do? - Perhaps we should move from this city. This one is not safe any longer to stay in. - You could go back to California for a while. - I'm not needed in California. - What good will it do for you to get shot? - A man must do what he believes. Thank you. - Well, did you tell him? - What, Luis? (children laughing) - Didn't Humberto tell you my idea? - Oh, you have an idea, Luis? - Yeah, a damn good one. El General goes to the bullfight every Tuesday. - So? - I'm going to kill him. - You are going to throw a bomb at him, perhaps? - How did you know? - Oh, you're not the only one with a splendid imagination. - You like my idea? - No, you know what I do every night, I pray for General. It's crazy, Reese, a crazy idea. You're not really going to do that. - I will do it! I have a plan! - Luis, listen, please! - No, I've listened enough! I didn't think you'd be afraid! - Luis, Luis! You don't really think that he's going to do such a crazy thing, huh? - No, of course not. He's just young. I used to be like him. Let's go. (soft music) (Miguel whistling) - Say, this priest sure looks like that guy. (melodic whistling) (suspenseful music) - Help me, please. I'm a priest. If you give me away, they'll kill me. (saxophone music) (suspenseful music) - I'm sure it was that priest. - It couldn't have been him. You know who she is, don't you? (saxophone music) (door slamming) - You saved my life. - The police, no friends of mine. - I think they've given up. - You know what I am? - A woman who saved my life. (laughing) - I am a prostitute. There, what saved your life, Priest, a prostitute. - I'm grateful to you. - Well, why don't you preach to me? Don't I make you uncomfortable? I take money from men who go to bed with me, any time of the day of night, any day, any man, hmm? Aren't you going to try and save me, Priest? - I needed you to save me today. - Hypocrite! (saxophone music) Aren't you going to try me, Priest? I could use the money. At least you won't be wasting my morning. I'll please you, I promise. - I'm sure you must be all that you say, but thank you, no. If I had any money, I would give you some. - Hypocrite! They have chased you all out of Mexico. No one wants you. - But even you must want me. You just invited me into your bed. - But not for free. Better go, it's time for one of my clients. It should be safe now. - What is your name? Goodbye and thank you. - My name is Loretto. (soft music) You didn't say you'd pray for me. - I'll pray for you, Loretto, if you will pray for me. (door slamming) (soft music) (upbeat music) (car engine rumbling) (upbeat music) (suspenseful music) (upbeat music) - Now where is that Luis? I told him to pick us up here, not to be late! I don't like it in the city this way. (suspenseful music) Oh my God, no! - What is it, Humberto? - El General must be on his way to the bullfights. - What does it matter? - If that young idiot uses our car to... - Not even Mitch can be that stupid. In our car? (suspenseful music) (upbeat music) (suspenseful music) (upbeat music) - Let's go! (loud explosion) (men chattering) (dramatic music) - But they are friends of yours and you know Miguel Pro is a priest and you used their car? Miguel Pro must have known. Tell us the truth, Luis. Miguel Pro plotted this, didn't he? - No, no. - But you talked it over and he said you should be... - I spoke to him. - That's all we need. - Miguel, please! I tell you, it's crazy to leave here. They're sure to trace the car to us. We must get out of Mexico City as soon as possible. It's dangerous here! - Yes Humberto, I know, but his grandmother is dying. I must go to her. Don't worry, I'll be back. - No, not here. Go to Concepcion to Senora Altera's. I'll send word to here. - Now sir, come, quickly! (loud slapping) - Don't be any longer than necessary. Senora Altera, Roberto and I will meet you there. Anna is safe where she stays now. - Come! (speaks in Latin) (soft music) (dramatic music) (all gasping) (dramatic music) (glass shattering) - This is the boy? - Yes, sir. - You saw him bring the priest to his grandmother's house? When you went there to get him, was his brother there too? Well young man, you must try to remember everything you heard them say, you understand? Everything! Here, get out. Come, come, what did they say? (door slamming) I think that they said Concepcion. - Senora Altera, did you hear them say that name? (soft music) (upbeat music) (loud knocking) (dramatic music) What do you want to do with them, General? - Huh? Hold a quick investigation, then shoot them! - But there is some doubt. There's only the car and the brothers claim it was stolen. - Look, I'm not interested in a long trial. You can prove that they were all involved in this assassination attempt, can't you? - But there is a great popular feeling, General. The reporter from the New York Press is still here and he may write about this in such a way that... - I can't help that! - But you know General, the Argentine ambassador has (faint speaking) and the ambassador from Peru has also expressed... - All right, all right! Now that they're captured, they just don't seem that important anymore. We'll let the young one go, I'll exile him, but the priest and his brother, no! - The people won't like a summary execution. - Well, do you think I like it? But I have all of Mexico to think about. Now that's all! Marinos? - Si, General? - What is he like, this priest? - Just another priest. - I want to talk to him. Bring him here. - Si, General. (tense music) (loud knocking) - Wait outside. (soft music) Sit down, sit down. (soft music) Sit down. Oh, can I offer you something? - Thank you, no. - My friend, why have you done this to me? You make a monster of me. Why do you force me to do things I do not like to do? - You do not like shooting me? - Why, no! If you had left Mexico like so many others, I would not have to shoot you. - But my work was here, in my own country. - Miguel, there's a right time for all things. It's not the time to be a priest in Mexico. - To me, it was the most important time. General, do you really believe that you can wipe away a man's religious beliefs overnight? - And why not? For too many years, the church had a stranglehold on our people. Ah, superstitions, fears. It was every weapon they could lay their hand on and with these weapons, they held everyone in bondage, a bondage worse than slavery! - You may be right, but let's be honest with each other. What kind of freedom are you offering them? - Their own brains. A new generation will grow up educated. They will use their brains to think! They won't have some priest thinking for them. - No, so you can think for them instead. A great pity. - Don't waste your pity. Your kind is finished. The young want no part of you. Today, tomorrow, the future belongs to the young. Can't you see that? You have nothing to offer them. - No General, the only thing I can see, perhaps I was not the one to offer it to them. - Miguel, Miguel, look, I really don't want to shoot you. Let's make a sensible deal. - A deal? - Yes, give me your word that you'll give up being a priest and I'll let you go free. - Could you give up being yourself? - Then you're gonna force me to shoot you, huh? - I ask you only one great favor. Let my brothers go free, they are not priests. - Your youngest brother is already free. The other, no. - Please! - No! He plotted too much against the state. Miguel, have you no fear of death? - Not if the Lord feels my work here is done. - The Lord, the Lord. I've lost my patience with you. Guard! You're a fool not to take my offer. Guard, take him away! Miguel Pro! What a pity you went into the priesthood. You would have made a great general. - With all due respect General, maybe you would have made a great pope. (laughing) - It's time. You understand that through all this, I have only been doing my duty as an officer, subject to my superiors. - I too am subject to a superior. - But they tell me you make jokes with the gods. - Not very good ones. Besides, you will have the last laugh. - I will not laugh. - Oh, I'm sorry. - Miguel? Please, Father. I ask you to forgive me. - I do. (tense music) (soft music) (tense music) Do not be afraid, Humberto. - I'm not afraid, Miguel. (guns banging) (horse whinnying) (tense music) - 30,000, isn't that what you said, Marinos? 30,000 mourners for a little priest. Well, it's all over now, he's dead.
