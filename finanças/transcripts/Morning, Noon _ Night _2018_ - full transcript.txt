Subtitles by explosiveskull I don't like you and you don't like me. Ah-ha, Big Cliff. What's up man? Marco, my main man. Down to the bottom, need more. - All out, I'm waitin'. - Shit, man. Well, when's that gonna be? Hopefully, today. Well, let me know when you do know. - All right? - Fo sho, you be cool. Yeah, yeah, you be cool. - Peace. - Yeah, peace out, whatever. Good morning, sweetie. Good morning, Daddy. You have blow all over your nose. What? Oh, shit. Is it gone? Yeah, why do you do so much blow? 'Cause it gives me an edge and I need that. In the corporate world, everything's about screw everybody else. I gotta be sharp as a razor, twice as sharp. It's worse than dog eat dog out there. It's wolf eat wolf. And those bastards want me outta there. See, I've reached the corporate glass ceiling. Can't go any higher than head of department at NFK without moving into executive, and executive is all a Japanese. And you may or may not have noticed, but I am not Japanese. You're too tall. That's right, and that gives me an advantage. Let me teach you a little something about having an advantage. When you've got an advantage, you have got to take advantage of it, pshew! Okay. And do me a favor, will ya? Stay outta my shit, okay? I don't even like blow. Then why'd you steal half a gram? It was for my friend. Oh, Emily who used to be Joel? Yeah, she's got a hard life. It's not easy being transgender. I can imagine. I find it challenging enough just being one gender. Apparently, there are like 200 genders nowadays. And look what I got stuck with. Oh, don't you talk like that. You are beautiful. Okay. So, you goin' to school today? I guess. What do you mean you guess? I hate school. I think I'm gonna drop out. Are you shitting me? You've already dropped out of two colleges and I had to eat the tuition both times. And Northern was fuckin' expensive! Well, look at it this way. Community college isn't nearly as much. So now you're saving me money, I suppose. Wait, that's bullshit; you pay for it. And so what are you gonna do now? You're gonna have to get a job, you know? So I'll get a job. Yeah, and then you'll quit after three days. Daddy, please, can you just leave me alone? Don't you have any ambition? - Hmm, no. - None at all? Don't you wanna be somebody? I am somebody. Yeah, you're right. You're a professional dropout. But it would be nice being rich. Oh, and how might you achieve that? I figured I'd just outlive you, inherit all your money. You know, at the rate you're going, it shouldn't even be that hard. I'd be surprised if you even made it to 60. I am going to slow down, I swear; once I get a little bit of time, which will be soon. - Sure. - You watch. Okay. So you see your mother lately? - No. - Talk to her lately? - No. - Why not? Because I hate Matt. She has terrible taste in men. - Hey, hey, watch it! - Not you, Daddy. You're wonderful. Good answer and you're right. I am wonderful in my own charmnoxious kind of way. So what's wrong with Matt? He's just a horrible, sloppy, disgusting drunk and Mom's zoned out on benzos all day watching the Home Shopping Network buying shit she doesn't need. - I hate it there. - Well, then stay here, - but go to school. - Okay. Listen, I got to go to work. We will talk about this droppin' out shit later. Fine. Look, I don't get it. Why drop out at all? I mean, aren't you takin' bullshit classes, like underwater basket weaving and poetry anyway? Creative writing and history, - with your old buddy, Aaron. - That's right. That sounds great, but, look. I gotta go, honey. - We'll talk about this later. - Okay. - I love you, muah. - Love you, too, Daddy. - And stay away from my blow! - Okay. And don't touch my Diet Coke. Never. That girl is gonna drive me to drinkin'. If I don't start drivin' that hot rod Lincoln, yeah. Fuck everything. Stupid mother fuckin', get the fuck outta the way! Get a life! Fuck. Fuck. I can't drink this. Every day is a miniature eternity. No. No. No! No! No, Jesus. No. No, Jesus Christ. No, not Teddy. Franklin Roosevelt, close. Still wrong. What caused the Great Depression? My dog died, funny. What brought the end of the Great Depression? Xanax; okay, funny man. There's an F, that stands for funny. Blessed Circe. Oh, I love the Beer Bash! The one day of the year where getting smashed is not only condoned, it's encouraged. All right, can anyone tell me when the first drug laws were introduced, anybody? Come on, just try. You. - In the '60s. - No. Anybody else? - You. - In the '20s. No, in 1729 in China when the emperor banned the sale and importation of the opium throughout the whole nation. And what happened next? Opium use just kept increasing and becoming more prevalent. Then, in the 1830s, the British realized that they were running a trade deficit with China. You see, there were a great many things that the West wanted from the Chinese, but nothing they wanted from them. So the British began shipping in wholesale opium into the country. And guess what? That shit just sells itself. Heroin, by the way, is a derivative of opium. And as more and more of the Chinese people got addicted, the emperors did not dig it, so they banned it. And what happened next? - It got more popular? - Exactly. So what can we take from all this? Stuff that's banned gets more popular. Precisely, just like the prohibition of alcohol here in the States in the 1920s. Ya see, when you tell people they can't have something they like, they'll find a way to get it. And prohibition was the direct cause of the birth of organized crime in this country, which began in Chicago, Detroit, and New York, and was controlled by the Mafia, which was predominantly Italian, though there were many ethnic groups involved. Including the Purple Gang right here in Detroit. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Oh, god. Oh, that's a good one. Ah, fuck. Ah, gross. Fuck it. Are you in school? My dad just asked me if I'm at school. I'm at school, call down; you're freaking out. He says, yes, I am. My dad's freaking out. Who isn't. Oh, shit. - Yeah. - Aaron. - Yeah. - What's wrong? - Nothing. - You sound weird. I just choked on some Gatorade. - Yeah, with vodka in it? - No, plain Gatorade. Right, ya know you're gonna get caught and then you're gonna get fired. Why don't you just stop drinking? Hey, Ms. Pothead, she without sin can cast the first stone. Hey, I smoke for fun; you're a drunk. I can quit anytime; you're addicted. - Really. - Yeah, really. What can I do for ya? - So, ya got any? - Pot? No, plutonium. - Yes, pot. - Sure. Can I come by after work and get some? Of course. Great, you goin' to the Beer Bash? Sure, I love the Beer Bash. - Figures. - How's your love life? Hmm, nothin' to write home about. How's yours? You kicked the life outta me. I might not ever recover. Bullshit. I'll see ya after work. Sure. Bitch. Oh, fuck! God dammit. I could look at purses all day. I could look at shoes forever. I hate Mr. Goldman. He thinks he's so smart. Well, I mean, he kinda is smart. He's been friends with my dad since they were like seven in elementary school or something. But I hate this school; it's so full of losers. People who can't get in a university. Yeah, like us. Oh, blah, blah, blah. Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit. I could just scream. And what am I supposed to do with history? Who cares? It already happened, what are you gonna do about it? We should be focusing on shit that's happening right now. I seriously don't care what happened yesterday. Me neither. So what do you got? I got some Oxycontin I stole from my grandmother. She's got pain pills in every drawer of the house and she's proud of it. Gets 'em prescribed from three different doctors. She says you don't have to go three steps in this house without finding more pain pills. She sets a great example. God, people are so fucked up these days. But I got some bars of Xanax I stole from my mom. Trade ya. I'm so sick and tired of this whole routine. Day in and day out, morning, noon, and night, the same fucking thing. I'm about ready to scream. I found a dope house. You did? Where, I'm not going to Detroit. Pretty close, Pontiac. - Shit, that is pretty close. - Mm-hmm. So what do we do? Well, Emily gave me the number and the address, so all I have to do is call. Are you sure you wanna do this? I don't know, do you? I don't know, I'm not sticking a needle in my arm. Well, me neither; we'll just snort it. I'm scared. It'll be fun. Like, yeah, it'll be fun. Let's just think about this for a second. Okay. It's a big deal. Okay. So call. Okay. - Call. - I'm scared. Okay, then let's just not do it. Okay. Hi, Smokey? This is Billie, Emily's friend. Can me and my friend come over? Yeah, I know where it is. Yeah, no. Okay, we'll be there soon. Shit , now what do we do? Well, we don't have to go. Yeah, we do. Why? Because I just said we would. So. So I don't wanna look like asshole. To who, Smokey? You don't even know him. Okay, so what do we do? I heard it's great. Emily said, you know how good it feels smoking pot? Well, it's a million times better. A million times, how? I don't know, but we can find out. - Okay, let's go. - All right. We're so bad. Can anyone tell me the reasons World War I started? Anybody? Just try. - You. - The spread of communism. That answer woulda worked for both the Korean and Vietnam Wars, but not World War I, good try. Anybody else? The sinking of the Maine. No, that was the Spanish-American War. How 'bout an arms race? Wasn't it the Cold War? It was, good response. But it was also one of the major causes for World War I before that. An arms race between who and who? Anybody? - You. - Japan and America? Jesus Christ. Did any of you do the assigned reading, anybody? Britain and Germany, ring any bells? Ding-a-ling! You, what year were you born? - 1996. - And who was the president? George Bush. - The second? - Oh, my god. You gotta be fuckin' kiddin' me. - You wanna try again? - No. Try anyway. I don't know, Obama? You're all nothin' but a bunch of slackers! Hey, we're Millennials and we don't like labels. Oh, my god. Look, this is the world you're living in like it or not. This isn't a dress rehearsal. This is it, okay? You've only got one shot at this. You can either choose to be present in your own lives or not. Fine, there's gonna be a test on this next week. I suggest you do the assigned reading or else you'll fail. And if ya blow this, then you're probably gonna blow the whole course, which, I'll remind you, is required. Then, you will be screwed. You can't use that kind of language in front of us, and call us names and threaten us. This is supposed to be a safe place. Is it really? I guess I forgot. I thought a classroom was a place to be challenged, a place that linger some ideas that are a little scary from time to time. My mistake, deepest apologies. Class dismissed. Do the reading. Really, it's fascinating stuff. I swear to god! Yeah, they wrangled me into working tonight. I don't like the fact that it sort of endorses drinking, but I do live in the community and it's only once a year, so what the heck, right? What about you, are you going? No, Debbie and I are going to the casino tonight. Oh, so do you like gambling? - Yeah, it's all right. - Okay. I'm not very good at it, but Debbie just loves it. She get so caught up in it. It's like she becomes someone else, like there's a devil inside her or something. Do any of your students do any of the required reading or anything else expected of them? - Some of them. - Yeah, some. - The good ones. - God. I don't think I have any good ones right now. They all stare at me so blankly with their dead eyes, doll's eyes. Then, I figure it's gotta be my fault, right? You know, this shit's really interesting. Maybe I'm making it boring. I had a history teacher in high school like that; third year, Mr. Zehue. That guy managed to make everything in history dull as rocks. Hated him for it, but have I become him? It's actually worse than that. It's like no one wants to listen to anything I have to say. It's just like they cut me off whenever... - Aaron, are you okay? - Yeah. - I'm just. - You're sweaty. Just a bad day is all. - Honestly, just a bad is all. - No, no. You're sweating and you're hyperventilating. - No, honestly, I'm fine. - Are you sick? Maybe I am coming down with something. Good talk, I'll see ya around. Oh, shit! Holy fuck, would ya look at this mess. Oh, shit. Big Cliff, the man of the hour. How so? Because I haven't talked to you in over an hour. Sorry, dude, nothin' yet. But you're expecting it, right? Sooner or later. - Hey, keep cool. - Yeah. You keep cool, all right? - Peace, man. - Yeah, yeah. Peace out, whatever. What happened? - Marco, fall through? - Exactly, so? It'll happen, bro, sooner or later. When? I'm waitin' here, too. That's what everybody keeps tellin' me. You let me know when, all right? - Hasta la vista. - Yeah, yeah, whatever. We're driving in circles. I'm telling you, this is it. This is it? It's the right address. It looks just like a normal house. Right. I suppose it would. I'm not going in there. Then, I'll go in alone. - Really? - Yeah, really. I want to get outta here as fast as I can, so I'll just say you're waiting. - You got any money? - Uh, yeah. 20 bucks. I got 40, also curtesy of my grandmother, who besides having pills stashed all over the house, also has money stashed everywhere just in case. Are you sure you wanna do this? I don't know, do ya think we shouldn't? I don't know, I mean, we could still go back. You know this is a really bad idea, right? - Uh-huh. - Fuck that. Wish me luck. Good luck. What the fuck? What the fuck? - I - understand, I understand. But it's like. Oh, fuck me. That's not good, but in the sixth grade I literally put my homeboy in a box. Oh, my god. They're getting weapons. I could leave. Fuck. I could just leave, but I can't leave Billie. Oh, my god. Come on, let's get outta here. Right. - Did you get it? - Yeah, I did. - Well, don't pull it out. - I won't. What was it like? There was a whole family in there, including an old lady and like four little... - Fuck, this is a dead end. - Well, turn around. Okay. Anyway, Smokey's a nice guy. Whole thing was effortless. Well, that's good to know. Shit, how do we get out of here, fuck. I'm telling you, that was the scariest moment of my entire life. I was sure they were gonna kill me. Look, I'm still shaking. - Do you see that? - Hmm. Well, let's see. - Did you lose it? - No, I didn't lose it. It's in here, calm down. You can trust me with this stuff. Here it is. - How much is that? - $60 worth. - No kidding. - Yeah. I asked him what to do, which he thought was cute. We should each cut one line each, about this long. So do we just chop it up like blow? Yeah, I suppose. Well, lucky for us, my dad has all the latest and most sophisticated equipment for cutting up and snorting blow. - Shall we? - We shall. Look at this, there's blow everywhere. Your dad's a slob. No, he's not, trust me. This place is normally perfectly cleaned and lined up. He must really be freaking out, geez. Look at this mess. Geez. If my dad doesn't get this buyout, he's gonna get fired. You cannot do as much blow as he does and go to work every day and get away with it. - He knows that. - Hmm, your dad's hot. - What? - He's hot. Ew, he's too old for you. Well, I know that but can't I say he's hot. - No. - Meh. Let's see. There it is. - You go first. - No, you. - No, I'm scared. - So am I. Okay, let's do it at the same time. - Okay. - Together. Yeah. - Ready? - I guess. - Okay. - Okay. One, two, three, go. Ah. Well, that's different. It kinda burns a little. Yeah, but not in a bad way. Yeah, it doesn't seem like much. No, but let's just wait and see what happens. - Yeah, okay. - Okay. - I think I feel sick. - You do? Maybe it's bad. No, I hear you're supposed to feel kinda sick and barf. - Right, yeah, I know that. - Okay. I think I feel sick, too. - I feel warm. - Me, too. - Nice and warm. - Yeah, tingly warm. - I feel it. - So do I. It's strong. It's kind of like this heavy-duty cough syrup my dad had once. Every time I passed the bathroom, I would take a slug and then float away on a rosy cloud. Jimmy Choo, Christian Louboutin. Chanel, Prada, Hermes. Brian Atwood, Miu Miu, Manolo Blahnik; transplendent. Givency, fabulous! - I wish I had a cigarette. - Me, too. And neither of us smokes. I see what this is. This is just one bad habit leading to the next. Do you think your dad has one sitting around? Probably, let's look. Alohamora! James, get the car. Let's sit outside. Right, yeah, cool. This is pretty awesome. A million times better than pot? Maybe. Then, we're totally fucked. I don't know if you're supposed to feel a million times better than regular. Why not, isn't better to feel good than to feel bad? Not this good. Wanna do a little more? I need to think about this. I've got a better idea. Let's not think about anything anymore. - Hey, guys. - Hey, Emily. Since when do you guys smoke? Since now. It's in a long line of new bad habits we're acquiring. So I take it you guys saw Smokey? - We did. - Well, she saw him. - I sat in the car. - And, what do ya think? He's a nice guy. Not him, the dope. - Oh, that. - Oh. Is there any left? Yeah, like all of it. So what do ya say we do some now, take the rest back to my house? Libby said she's coming over later. And you're in love with Libby? So what, I am? So you became a girl, then fell in love with a girl? I guess so. Ironic, isn't it? I guess I like girls. Whatever, come on you dope fiends. - Let's go. - M'kay. My neighbor's kid got arrested last night. - For what? - He was so drunk and high that his buddies called him an Uber car and apparently they gave him the wrong address, so the kid walks into the wrong house and goes to sleep on the couch. And he was arrested for what? Unlawful entry and burglary, even though he didn't take anything. Wait, I don't get it. If he didn't take anything, then why burglary? Because apparently, after dark, unlawful entry automatically becomes burglary. It's like a mandatory sentence. Wow, that's bullshit. How old's the kid? I mean, he's no kid really. - He's 35. - Oh, hell. You gotta be blind drunk to walk into the wrong house and fall asleep on the couch. Yeah, I've never been that drunk. Me, neither. In his favor, he was still pretty new to the neighborhood. - Still. - Still. So, Mr. Johnson, let's step up to the plate. Shall we put our cards on the table, yes? All right, I've been head of sales of NFK for five years. During that time, sales are up 17%. Now, as per our contract, it is time for both a raise and a promotion. Indeed, valid point; a reasonable bump in pay. A promotion, no. - Difficult. - What? Would you care for some sake? Please. Very good, very expensive. - The best. - Of course. Cheers. Well, as you're well aware, NFK is based in Japan with the headquarters in Tokyo. Yes, I've been there a number of times. And you will notice that all of our top executives - are Japanese. - Yes, I noticed that. - Coincidence? - Yes. Well, for you to go beyond your present position would put you in the top executive rank, but it's not possible for you. - In Japan. - What do you mean? We are here in America. We have laws that prohibit discrimination based on race, and that is what you're talking about here, right? Oh, I'm well aware of these laws. It's not possible. Things are not gonna change. This is a Japanese company. Now, let us get our fish in a row. You can stay in your present position with comfortable pay, but you might want to move on to another company. Hopefully, with no grass roof. We will make it well worth your time. - More sake? - Please. So, tell me, how exactly will NFK make it worth my while? An extremely generous compensatory offer has already been made. However, just because an offer has been made does not mean that it has automatically been accepted. Psht, some pertinent information, we don't know might be missing as we are making our decision about you. Yes, and I have no doubt that you've examined the numbers thoroughly. But what I don't think you've truly grasped is what if I decide to stay on in my present position. - With substantial pay? - Well, again, Mr. Miura, those are just numbers. They hardly reflect the reality of the situation. And what, Mr. Johnson, is the reality of the situation? If I may speak bluntly, sir, although I do fear offending your delicate Japanese sensibilities. Please, Mr. Johnson, speak bluntly. I don't like you and you don't like me. Bluntly noted. But with your attitude and your behavior, I'm not particularly fond of it. Like what for example? What is that stain on your shirt? - That awful stain? - Snot. Now, let's say that we were to work together for another five years. That could make us both irritable and perhaps not as constructive as we might be were we working with other people. - Possibly so. - Now, I have already spoken to my attorney and he assures me that any legal proceedings regarding race discrimination would be very public and cost us both money, a lot of money. Money that in my minds I could much more easily be added to my buyout package. Now, in the end, I think that both sides will find this new arrangement most satisfactory. You have us you say, how do you say, under a barrel? No, sir, over a barrel. But the truth is I just want what's best for all parties, NFK in particular, who I do feel that I am a integral part of even though I'm not Japanese. I have been head of sales for five years. I have been here for 18 years. I was here long before you, Mr. Miura. I have been at NFK for 25 years. Yes, but not here; not in the United States. And believe it or not, we count, too. - Do you now? - Yes. And, now, I'm sure I can count on NFK showing me just how much I truly mean to them. Well, can't you leaves sleeping dogs lie? You may well get away with this. Yes, I think it might and so does my attorney. Now, if you will just make certain of it, I have no doubt that both parties will leave this negotiation satisfied. Thank you, Mr. Johnson. No, thank you, Mr. Miura. - Hello? - Hi, Mom. - How are you today? - Very tired. I don't know what's gotten into me. I can barely hold the phone. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. - Are you still drinking? - No. But I can hear the cubes clinking. No, you didn't. It's a bad connection. You know these modern cellphones. It's a wonder they work at all. I don't know, I don't have one. Look, I can hardly breathe. - I'll talk to you later, okay? - Okay, Mom. - I love you. - I love you, too, honey. - Hello? - Hey, Pat. I just talked to Mom for like 10 seconds. She sounds terrible. She's taking way too many sleeping pills. Well, what can we do about it? We, what do you mean we, white man? - It's just me. - Okay, you. I try to take them away from her, but I can't. But what's the difference? She won't even try anymore. She won't do physical therapy. She won't do anything except lie on the couch with her mouth open and her hands all curled up like she's already dead. So when are you gonna come down here and visit? I can't, it's mid semester. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's always something. You haven't seen Mom in eight years. I know; I feel terrible about it. Yeah, I'll bet you do. Are you still drinking like it's going out of style? No, I'm doing really good. I can hear the ice cubes clinking. - No, you didn't. - Yes, I did. - Bad connection. - Bullshit. - Gotta go, talk to ya later. - Bye. Fuck. Eh, right on time. Ah, Christ, you started without me. Look at you, you're saturated. - Not quite yet. - Ah, face it. You're perpetually pickled. It's twue, it's twue! Oh, god, you smell like a dill pickle. Come on, fess up. Why do you drink so much? Is it because I broke your heart? I was drinking long before you broke my heart, my dear. Part of the reason you dumped me was my drinking, remember? Hmm, nope, guess I moved on. - So have I. - Yeah, to Cloud Cuckoo Land. So stop avoiding the question. - Why do you drink so much? - Why not? That's a bullshit answer. Any answer I give you is gonna be bullshit. - Try me. - Okay. I'm 50 years old and I'm only an associate professor of history at a crumby little community college. How's that? I've got the worst students in the history of education, like since before Ancient Greece. I mean, ever. And I've spent years writing an historical novel on a truly worthy subject, Stephen Decatur, who really deserves a good book to be written about him, but I can't do it. I'm not good enough; my prose sucks. - So try harder. - Yeah. - Thanks for the advice. - What? You really think that those are good enough reasons? Come on, reasons don't matter. Oh, I had a tough childhood. My dad kicked my ass. My mommy didn't love me. Oh, terrible me! Please, reasons only matter in stories; not in real life. Well, okay, why do you smoke so much reefer? - I like it. - There you go. That's why I drink. Well, weed doesn't make me puke. Yeah, be thankful for small favors. Look, why don't you just drink two - or three drinks and stop? - I can't. Why don't you just drink beer? Inefficient. Look, I gotta go. I gotta go pick up Max from his anger management in an hour. Poor Max. You know, you can't just punch a guy in the mouth anymore for bein' an asshole. Hey, you like my new sweater? Yeah, it's pretty. Hmm, I got it on sale. Half off, it's 100% cashmere. Are you goin' to the Beer Bash later? Sure, it's my night. The one night of the year where gettin' hammered is encouraged. Mm-mm, not really. Close enough. Well, then I guess I'll see ya later. Sure. Could you bring one? Don't I always? Yes, it's one of the few reasons I still like you. Hey, quit bogartin' and pass it over here. Will ya? Hello? Hey, Cliff. What happen, Marco and Bill let ya down? - Yes, they did, so? - You're in luck. I'm in the neighborhood, I'll drop by. - Great, when? - Soon. - How soon? - Very soon. Great, thanks! Yes, whoa! Jesus Christ, slow the fuck down! You're in a residential neighborhood. - Your own, in fact. - Geez, I'm sorry. You are the last person I wanna run over at this particular moment. Oh, well, thank god I got that goin' for me. Otherwise, I'd be just chopped liver. Sorry. I can't stay long. - 300? - Yep. Is it any good? No, Cliff, it's shit. Should I take it home? Hell, no! No, geez, I just asked a question. - You goin' to Dick's Friday? - Maybe. - Fred's band is playing. - Maybe. It would be nice to see you there. A definite maybe. Don't you wanna see me? You know I do. - How much? - Very much. Now, just give, give, give me the fuckin' blow! - All right, I gotta go. - All right, thanks. - Have fun. - I will. Oh, and slow down. There are kids all over the place. All right, I will, thanks. God. Stay. Bill, good to see you. Come on in. You called a few hours ago. A couple times, right? Yeah, of course, I did. Then, why are you so surprised to see me? I don't know. Home delivery, it's just for you, because I've known you so damn long. 300, right? That's what it is. Hasn't changed since last week, but you never know; prices fluctuate. Well, thanks a lot. How the fireworks goin'? Awesome, I've been building four and five-stage rockets in my house without a permit. Now, totally fucked up and smokin'. - Isn't that dangerous? - Well, yeah. I could take out my whole house. Hell, I've got enough black powder, I could take out both my neighbors, but I'm gonna have the biggest 4th of July celebration in all of lower southwestern Michigan, yeah. - If you say so, man. - Yeah, I did say. And you know what else is the bee's tits? No, what? You take a full stick of dynamite, stick it in a shell hole, ya light it, lay down about 10 feet away. And then what happens? The whole world blows up. It's fucking awesome , mind-blowing. I bet. Thanks so much for coming by, man. Yeah, no problem. Keep in touch, I know you will. You know I will. ♪ Bum, bum, bum, bum, cocaine ♪ ♪ Dun, dun, dun, dun ♪ Oh, my god. I've got eight grams of blow. That's a lot. Where's my fuckin' mirror? Who the fuck is that? Marco, it's good to, what on earth are you doin' here? - Come on in. - What? What do you mean what I'm doin' here? You just called me. Yeah, I did. Anywho. This is the premium shit. You want some? No, can't stay, I got Diane waitin'. So it's 300, right? Now, you know you my man. If I could give it to you for any less, I would. My man! You'll never guess what happened to me. Humor me, what? Well, first, I called you and you were out. So then I called Bill and he was out. So then I called Sandra and she was right here, right in the fuckin' driveway. I almost hit her with my car, so I scored from her, and then Bill came over and now you're here. So what you sayin'? I'm sayin' I got three eight balls, 12 grams of blow. ♪ Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, cocaine ♪ Three eight balls, you? Yeah, what do ya mean, me? Dude, I am not your conscience. In fact, I'm your fuckin' drug dealer, but you are way too big of a cokehead to have 12 grams of coke lyin' around your crib at one time. You gonna kill yourself. Marco, my man, don't be ridiculous. I am a grown ass adult, possibly retired with a very healthy pension. - I know what I'm doin'. - Really? I know what I'm doin' when it comes to blow. I fuckin' doubt it. - But just be careful, okay? - All right. All right, I will, I promise. You give my best to Diane, all right? Yeah, all right. Fuckin' idiot. ♪ Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum cocaine ♪ ♪ Bum, bum, bum ♪ Three, four, five. Six, seven, eight, nine. Oh, my god, will ya look at all this. All right, where is my fuckin' mirror? Oh, you little bitch! How dare she use my shit? And now you're doin' blow? You don't got enough problems? Where'd you get the money? God dammit. Oh, yuck, what the fuck is that, dirt? Ugh, god dammit. What's the matter, Kelly, too busy? Now, who the fuck is that? 'Sup, dudes, come on in. You have three eight balls? I know. You guys want some? That's too much for you. - What? - It is! Why don't you admit it? You should not have three eight balls lyin' around your crib at one time. What are the two of you saying? Give two back. Yeah, we'll give 'em back to you later. - When? - Tomorrow or the next day. You have no right, I won't do it. Real talk, Cliff. Just look at it this way. You are our best client. We don't wanna lose you, bro. - Exactly. - Listen, listen. If I put my mind to it, I could probably kill myself with one eight ball. So what difference does it make if I got three? We're your coke dealers and we know better than you, - so give it up. - This is outrageous! - I won't do it. - Yes, ya will. I want my money back. You want your money back? All right, you know I didn't mean that. It's just, you can't... Okay, I'll give you one. You're not gonna do two eight balls in one night. You're probably not even gonna do all of one, so just give us two back, one each. I don't see why this is necessary? It just is, do it! We're your friends, Cliff. This is so, you can't a, god! It's just not done! This is my. Fine, I'll get the blow. Damn. You need to give us two. You can't handle everything you got there. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Ha! Fine, fine, you're my friends. I get it, there. Man, there's only seven grams in here. What, I don't know how that happened. - I counted. - Keep it. Face it, Cliff, you're a fiend. You just might have a problem. Moi, a problem, don't be ridiculous. Hey, when you want this, just call me and I'll bring it over, all right? Thank you. I don't know another cokehead on the planet who has drug dealers as kind and as thoughtful as the two of you. I'm sure you're right. - Let's go. - Yeah. Fuckin' idiot. My coke dealers just had an intervention on me. Is it possible that I do have a problem? An issue, somethin' that needs lookin' into? Nah. ♪ Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum cocaine ♪ Ah, god dammit. Go, get in there. 'Kay, all right. There we go. I got coke, I got my phone. All I need now is to change my clothes and I am outta here. Well, if it's not my prized students. Mr. Goldman. Mr. Goldman? I'm not Aaron to you after all these years? Come on, Kelly! You know I spent every weekend at your house when you were a kid drinkin' beer with your old man. Don't you remember? I remember, Aaron. Fancy running into you at a Beer Fest. Yes, perfect example of irony. Get this. My dad had a party once, when the Tigers were in the World Series, and you walked in and asked, who's playing? Who started World War II? - What? - Just kidding. Correct answer, Germany. - I knew that. - Bullshit. Got a light? Billie. Emily, if I denied you your safe space in class today, again, I sincerely apologize. From now on, my class will be a safe space within a safe space and we'll only talk about the happy events in history. You seemed like you were getting awfully tense in class today, Mr. Goldman. Guess what? I was, I'm the teacher. I'm attempting to inculcate information, which I believe is not only important but invaluable, and you little rat bastards don't give a shit and won't even try. You can't call us rat bastards. Oh, yes, I can. We're not in class now. This is not a safe space. This is the real world. Rat bastards, rat bastards, rat bastards! Okay, so why is it important? - What, history? - Yeah. - Why is it important? - Yeah, why? Okay, good question, a fair one. History allows you to form a philosophy based on previous examples. Without history, you would have no idea if you were thinking a new thought or not, and chances are you're not. It gives you a view of where and when you live. Where you are in reality and what's reality? - Like where we are right now? - Yes! In space and time. Jesus, in space, we're right in front of the VFW Hall. And in time, this is the present moment of a continuing and continuous timeline. Since you can't see what's ahead, you can only see what's behind and use that as an example. What's already happened is the only indicator of what's to come. That's a good answer, Mr. Goldman. - Yeah, cool. - Mm-hmm. Thanks. You know, that's the only point I think I got across today and it's to three stoners in a parking lot. That's probably right, Mr. Goldman. Still, I'm gonna go get some beer. Are you guys just gonna hang out and smoke cigarettes all night? - Maybe. - Probably. - Mm-hmm. - All right. I'll see ya around. Oh, and do the assigned reading or face the consequences. Yes, Mr. Goldman. Hi, Mimi. - Aaron. - How are you? Peachy, you? Meh, so far so good. You know, it's strange to see you outside the setting of the liquor store. Yeah. Say, can I get a look at that stein on the top shelf? Sure. Made in Japan, how appropriate. No, thanks. Okay. Well, it's always great to see you. Have a good night, okay? Bye. - Goldman! - Johnson! - Hey! - How are ya? - Good, man, you? - Great. - What's up? - Nothin'. Hey, you wanna go smoke a joint? Yeah, I'm holdin'. Maybe a little later on, all right? All right, you know, I always loved that about you. You've always got weed, and so do I. I'll tell ya what, let's get a couple beers in us, and then we'll sneak out to the parking lot. - Absolutely. - Right on. How many? - I'll take 10. - Five's the limit. Ooh, but if I spend those five, I can come back for more, right? I suppose, but that's a lotta beer. That's okay, I like beer. That's why I'm here. I'll have five tickets, please. Thank you. - 10 tickets, please. - Didn't you just hear? - Just kidding. - Very funny. Oh, I do try. Hey, aren't you Nate Goldman's son? - Yes, I am. - How's he doing? Eh, he's hangin' on by the skin of his teeth. Well, tell him Gloria sends her best. I will, Gloria, thank you. Hello, there. Can I have two, please? - Thank you. - Thank you. Two beers, please. - Thank you, sweetheart. - Thank you. - Cheers. - Cheers. You know, whenever I hear the name Cliff Johnson, I always envision a fat kid in my head. Fuck you. I was a fat kid. I was the fattest kid on my whole little league team. You know, whenever someone says Aaron Goldman to me, I always picture some long-haired hippy freak. - Man, we have changed. - Yeah. So, you wanna do some blow? Really, blow huh? Wow, if I recall, that always make me nervous and agitated. I don't know, maybe later. Hmm, been drinkin' a lot lately? - Oh, yeah. - Hmm. I drink between 14 and 20 beers every night. No shit, how do ya do it, man? You're in great shape. Ah, I'd have to say it's probably the coke. Keeps my metabolism up. Psht, that it would. So, you seen Nikki lately? Yeah, about an hour ago. She should be here at anytime. Two of you still together? No, I dare say we never will be. I don't meet any of her requirements. And what are those? Ah, let's see. I don't make enough money, I don't have any kids, and I'm not tall enough. Wait, wait, wait. I seem to remember that you're taller than she is. Yeah, by about two inches, but not when she's in heels. Oh, and whoever the lucky guy is, he can't be a drunk. Oh, well, then did you ever stop and ask yourself, what it was she liked about you? Sure, I've always got pot. Well, as long you keep buyin' weed, the two of you will always have that. - Right. - So ya wanna do a bump? Huh? - Blow, coke. - Yeah, sure. - Where should we go? - I don't know. You didn't drive, did you? - Fuck no. - No, me either. Looks like it's the bathroom. Lead on. - Here, hold that. - Sure. Man, your daughter and her friends are really fucked up. - On what? - I don't know. Kids take a lotta pills these days, and heroin. That's what was on my fuckin' mirror. - What? - On my coke mirror, they musta put heroin on it. I tasted it and it sure as hell wasn't blow. God dammit, that little bitch! What has she got herself into now? He says as he gets ready to snort coke off of a public toilet. Oh, here. So, you here about Claw? Ah, Claw! Calvin Coolidge Claw, the worst kid in school. He was worse than you and me combined, and that's sayin' something. I've always liked him, how's he doin'? - He's dead. - Claw's dead? - Yeah, he killed himself. - Fuck, how? Get this, he goes to work one morning, like he did every morning at some insurance company. Walks into the main lobby in front of everyone, pulls out a gun, and shoots himself in the forehead. - Why? - Why? Who the fuck knows why? Why does anybody do anything? But I do know that Claw loved his booze and drugs, man. He was a miserable drunk for years. Shit, ex-wives, kids, whatever. Who knows, man? But, fuck, right in the forehead. Oh, Jesus, that's horrible. - I know, man. - It's sick. Yep, here, do a couple lines. Yeah, all right. Fuck. It's good to see you, Goldman. I mean, considering we live like five and a half blocks from each other, how come we don't see each other anymore? I don't know, you tell me. Shit, that news about Claw is freakin' me out. We were really close in grade school. One time, we were out wrestlin' in the yard, ya know? Just fuckin' around, and for no reason at all, he spits his bubblegum into his hand. It had to be like four or five pieces of Bazooka, right? And he just rubbed it into my scalp. I had a bald spot on my head for a month. What a fuckin' asshole thing to do. It wasn't funny but, man, did he laugh. He laughed his god damn head off. I swear to god. I thought he was gonna croak he was laughin' so hard. - Now, he's dead. - Hmm, yeah. Shit, you go to the funeral? Fuck no, it's in Grand Rapids, but Shane Bullet went. - Said it was a open casket. - Get out! Yeah, and he said that no matter how much putty they used, you could still see the fuckin' hole. - Oh, sick! - Yeah. God dammit, gimme the coke, I'll lay out a couple more lines. Yeah, sure. Jesus, I'm sorry, man. You fuckin' idiot! Look what you did! That's all I've got! What the fuck is the matter with you? Do you know what I had to do to get that? My fuckin' drug dealers had an intervention on me! Aw, I oughta fuckin' kill you! Man, just get the fuck outta the way, Jesus! I'm really sorry, man. Great seein' ya. What about the broken glass? Fuck the broken glass! Ah! Holy shit! My cashmere sweater! I'm so sorry. Fuck, what is the matter with you? It was an accident! Yeah, your whole life is an accident. - I'll get some napkins. - Oh, geez! This is a catastrophe! It's gonna be fine, I'll be right back. - Fuck. - Stupid. Get over here. You took heroin? I did what? Ya took heroin? No, I didn't. Oh, ya didn't? Then, what the fuck was that all over my mirror? Uh, nothing. Nothin', oh, don't give me that shit. It sure as hell was something and it wasn't blow. Well, it's all over your nose. Fuck that, if it wasn't heroin, then what was it? - Uh. - Don't you lie to me! I've never lied to you! Well, then what was it then? Vicodin. What are you talking about? That's a pill. We crushed it up and snorted it. Why did ya do that? 'Cause it works faster that way and it gets ya higher. Why would you do that? For the fucking fun of it! Why do you snort cocaine? This is not about me! Daddy, please, can we just talk about this later? Do you want to live with me or not? Yes. Well, then cut this shit out! Okay, okay. - Okay? - Okay. All right. - Okay. - Good. - Let's get a beer. - Right. Let's get a beer. - Are you all right? - I don't know. The lights are flashin', my heart is racing. I think I might be havin' a heart attack. No, you're not, wipe your nose. Right, wipe my nose. Good? Yeah, come on, you'll be fine. Right, I'll be fine. Thank you, mm-hmm. Hey, Aaron, how are you? Great, two beers, please. You got any napkins or paper towels? Yeah, so you really don't have any good students this semester? None, I'd halfway kill them all, but that might not be the best answer. I'd just be happy to get through to at least one of them. Yes, well, there's always next semester, right? It'll be here soon enough and you can only hope it'll get better, right? - So how are you? - Great. I couldn't be better, why? Well, my sister-in-law, she has a. - A what? - You know, a. - A problem with her hand? - No. - A drinking problem. - Right! Well, I hope she figures out how to deal with that. - What about you? - What about me? I'm fine. Everybody knows. - Do they? - Yeah. Fuck 'em. Thanks for the paper towels. - God bless. - Sure he does. - That's his job. - Mm, mm, mm. - Hi. - Hi! - Another one. - Okay. You're gonna have to leave. It's not my fault. The paper bunting shit got in my face. You're obviously intoxicated. Now, just leave and be thankful we don't call the police. Police, I fell down? You're drunk. Now, come on; move it. You're ruining everyone's good time. Be cool, man, no pushing. You oughta be ashamed, making a drunken spectacle of yourself at Oktoberfest! Ya got a light? Sure, what just happened? Did they throw ya outta there? I just fell into the paper bunting shit. I just knocked over some beer bottles. I don't know. And they wanna call the cops on me. My own fucking neighbors. Hey, I'm an optimist, too. Fuck you! So, girls, what was the first drug ever made? - Uh, opium. - In China. - In 1729. - That's right. You sly devils, you only pretend that you're stupid. Heroin is a concentrated form of opium and it's an extremely powerful drug. So is booze. Yes, it is very strong, my undoing. But everybody's gotta choose their own poison. Look at this. Ew, gross, is that some kind of deformity? Grow up, yeah, I got it during the Battle of the Bulge. What war was that? - Fuck off. - No, you. Fuck you, pfft. No, fuck you, World War II. Here's lookin' at you kids. Oh, god. Aaron, you're a fiend. So is your dad. You're tellin' me, I live with him. Wow! Good work, Goldman. Tossed out on your ass, that's impressive. I'm glad to see you still got the same old spirit. - Thanks. - Claw would approve. - Kelly. - Dad. Girls. - Emily. - Hmm, thoughtful. Aren't I though, charmnoxious? - Anyone wanna smoke a joint? - Mm-hmm. Hey, guys, you started without me. Hey, Einstein, you knocked over everything. You're the biggest schmuck in the world. Well, it's a tough job, but somebody's gotta do it. God, in his infinite wisdom, chose me. Pass the joint. There we go. Think I'll get in trouble at school for this? - Oh, no. - What do you think? I mean, how are they gonna find out? Right, man, of course. Oh, really, 'cause Ms. Mosely, the English teacher, was in there sellin' beers. - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. Oh, fuck, you mean Vicki. Oh, shit, she's a blabbermouth. Everybody's gonna hear about this. Fuck, I'm screwed. Oh, well, what are you gonna do? - Aaron, you skipped me. - Oh, shut up. Here, you go, Dad. Wait, wait, wait. Hey, man, why don't you spark yours up? - Yeah, sure. - Yeah. Twice the fun. There we go, thank you, dear. - Yeah, Dad. - It's gender discrimination. - Sounds good. - More, more. So you will never guess who got a Harley. Who? Ronnie. Christ, he's a bigger drunk than me! I know, and so the first thing he does, is he gets drunk and he crashes it right into a wall at Goldman Optical right there on Woodward. - Oh, my god. - Psht. And they say he lost a testicle. Yeah, but he's still a good electrician though. Got a cigarette, Mr. Johnson? Sure. So you gonna light that thing or not, knucklehead? - I ain't got a lighter. - Here. For you, dear. - Somebody take this roach. - Here, I'll take it. - Thank you. - Go ahead and pass me... - I'll take one of the newbs. - Your dad's hot as shit. There we go. - I'll do what I want. - Fuck you. More for me. Now, don't be bogartin' that. Oh, yes, pass that to mommy. - I will finish that. - Hey, now. Aaron. You look great in that turtleneck, by the way. - Thank you. - Oh, yeah. Can you see it? I told you it was a good look. - L'chaim. - Salute! Subtitles by explosiveskull
