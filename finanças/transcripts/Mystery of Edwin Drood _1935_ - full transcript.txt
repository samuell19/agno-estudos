Mr. Jasper was took a little poorly, Sir. Say taken to the Dean. And how was Mr. Jasper taken? Mr. Jasper was that breathless. Breathless to the Dean, Durdles. It was some sort of a fit it seemed to me. Poor Mr. Jasper has been going up to London twice a week for treatment, Sir. But he insists that it's nothing serious. Indeed I trust not. Jack! Ned! Oh my dear Edwin, I didn't expect you so soon. Let me take your coat. Aren't your feet wet? Pull your boots off. My dear Uncle I'm dry as a bone. There's slippers in your room. Don't mollycoddle me, I'm 21 you know. But it's hard not to. You must remember I made a habit of it for 14 years. Would it be mollycoddling you to give you a hot drink? Oh, good old fellow. Up to much to the old days. When you're 34 you won't want to be called old. Don't be silly. I see you placed my sketch of Rosa in a place of honor. Yes, Ned. It's the best drawing you ever made, that's why I put it there. I should be able to catch that capricious expression, I've seen it often enough. I don't find it on her face when I go to see her, I leave it there. Come in. Well if it isn't Mrs Tope, Lovelier than ever. Give me a kiss because tomorrow is Rosa' birthday. Your uncle spoiled you, young man, that's what it is. I think you have the right to make free with anyone. I've a mind to tell Miss Rosa on him. And you engaged to her in your cradle. When two people are engaged in their cradles, there's a certain flatness to it. Everything is settled before you begin. You know I almost envy you Jack. Your life hasn't been mapped out for you. You envy me? Because you're free and independent, respected as a lay clerk here. You choose your own society, no wife when you want one. One of the most popular men in Cloisterham. I hate it here. The cramped monotony of my existence grinds me away. How does our service sound to you? Beautiful! Quite celestial. It often sounds to me quite devilish. I'm so weary of it all. No wretched monk who ever droned his life away in that gloomy cathedral could be more tired of it. He could take to carving demons for relief and did. What shall I do? Must I take to carving them out of my heart? I thought you had so exactly found your niche in life, Jack. They all think so. Rosa thinks so. When did she say so? The last time I was here. How did she phrase it? She said you were made for your vocation. How's she doing with her music? Need more lessons. She won't be taking many more lessons from you, Jack. I know it. I'm going out to Egypt after Christmas. That engineering job is all settled. I might as well marry her and take her with me. But she's still a child, she's still in school. She's 18 tomorrow. Does Rosa know about this? I came down to tell her. Miss Rosa Bud, please. Yes, Sir, You step into Miss Twinkleton's parlor. Oh don't, Eddy. Don't what, Rosa? Coming in nearer. So absurd. What's absurd? To be an engaged orphan. You've given me an affectionate welcome, I must say. Well, I will in a minute, but I can't just yet. A acidulated drop. How do you do, Mr. Drood? Very glad indeed to have the pleasure. Pray excuse me. Tweezers, thank you. Your birthday present. Gloves? How did you guess? Because you gave me gloves last year and the year before. Don't let's start nagging. Sorry, my fault. Thanks for the gloves. All the girls gave me presents. We had a dance last night. Without any partners? How dull. Chavey girls pretended to be their brothers. It was so droll. Did anybody pretended to be.. - To be you? - Yes. Oh indeed yes, and I refused to dance with you. But why? Because I was so tired of you. Don't be angry, you were just as tired of me. I trust I disturb no one, but there WAS a paper-knife. Mr. Drood is well; Though I needn't ask if I may judge from complexion. I have something very important to tell you, a decision I've come to. Then let's go for a walk. Has anybody seen my pearl button-holder? Can we go for a walk, Miss Twinkleton? You can, the question should have been, may you? You may. Think of all we can see out there. Sphinx, and the pyramids, the hot sun. But I don't want to go to Egypt. Musty old mummies and sand. But you're 18. If we're going to do it the way our parents wanted us to we'd better get it over with. I suppose so. Give me a kiss, a quick one. Nobody is looking, doo, doo! You never want to kiss me. What are you eating? Lumps-of-Delight. What's that? A Turkish sweetmeat, don't you know anything? Might offer me one. Sorry, that was the last. That's Jack. Poor fellow, he's going to miss us. I don't like it here, do you? Oh, we haven't had a very happy walk, have we? We seem to try one another. I'm a young little thing to have an old heartache. But I really, really have sometimes. Don't be angry with me. I know you have one too. Shut up. We may be happy yet. - Oh. - Ooh. You are sticky. Oh, why couldn't left us alone? I'm very fond of you and yet I don't have any more fun walking with you than I do walking with Miss Twinkleton and the girls. Now young ladies, remember, eyes cast modestly down, hands crossed, step neatly paced and no indecent exposure of the ankles, let us proceed. No staring, no giggling, no laughing and no swishing. Look, Neville, now we can see the spires of the cathedral. A sleepy place it looks. All these changes are behind us and no more comfort. I feel... Careful with that whip, my man, you nearly cut my sister's face. Think I don't know how to handle a whip, Sir? Forgive me. Oh it's all right, Neville, really it is. Now behave yourself! - Your hat, Sir. - Thank you. - Good morning. - Good morning. Young ladies, order. A crisis is a test of breeding. Remember you are Britains! Let us proceed. Miss Helena Landless, I presume. I'm Septimus Crisparkle, here to tutor your brother. How do you do? My brother jumped off the coach. Your brother jumped off the coach? Neville is a little impulsive. - Whoever he may be, Mr. - Crisparkle, I am glad you have that heathen not me, sir. Oh, Neville, are you all right? Yes, of course. Welcome to Cloisterham, Mr. Landless. I'm Crisparkle. How do you do? Oh, please Neville. Tomorrow you're my pupil, but today you are my guest. George, send the rest of the rest of the luggage up to my house, this way. You're very kind. My mother is expecting you both to dinner. She's inviting three young people to meet you. So you won't think that everybody here is antiquated. For you, my mother dear. They're the last of the season. They're just the color of the roses of your cheek. Oh, I do hope the roast didn't overdone. I wished we hadn't come to England. I'd rather be shot than meet them. At least you have am amiable jailer. You don't have to be cooped up in a school with a lot of giggling girls. It's being cooped up that's detestable. Miss Landless. Yes, Mr. Crisparkle. Miss Twinkleton, let me present Miss Helena Landless, your new pupil. How do you do? And Mr. Neville Landless, my new pupil. How do you do? Miss Bud. This is Miss Landless who is to be your new school mate. How do you do? And her brother. How do you do? You're the one brought in the London coach. Yes. From Ceylon I believe, bounded on the northside Indian Ocean. Bounded on the south by the Indian Ocean. I see you know. How do you do? Oh Miss Landless. Helena, I'm so glad you're rooming with me, we're going to be such friends. Thank you, Miss Bud. No, Rosa. Isn't it an absurd name, Rosa Bud? Of course they all call me Rose Bud, I hate it, you won't, will you? Never. - Neville? - Yes. Mr. Drood, this is my guest and pupil, Mr. Neville Landless. How are you, ever been in England before? No. From Sumatra you said? Ceylon. Oh, Ceylon, I'm sorry, where the tea comes from, isn't it? Will everyone please come to table. Miss Twinkleton, on my son's right. Thank you Mrs Crisparkle. And you sit on the second feet on the left. You look very lovely tonight, my dear pupil. Thank you, Mr. Jasper. Mr. Neville, you sit next in row with me. Thank you. And you sit next to me. Thank you. Imaging growing girls like you in Ceylon. I think it would be worth all the tea on the island. It is an island, isn't it? It is an island. I love your sister, Mr. Landless. I've never been jealous of my sister until this minute. Look at Rosa, flirting with him. You think she'll look at me like that after she marries me? Is Rosa going to marry you? Yes, of course, didn't you know? We've been engaged since we were babies. I hope you'll both be happy here. You doubt it? Cloisterham must seem so cooped in and musty after Ceylon. I have no idea what Ceylon is like. Ceylon is hell. England with people like you living in it must be heaven. I want to propose a toast. To the most charming young lady in Cloisterham, on the occasion of her 18th birthday. May she always be cherished as she is now. Rosa. - I didn't know she was... - Can't go... always inspired me on the piano. Listen, may I have a word with you. Alone, now? On something this... Well my boy... I've got to tell you, I can't hide things. My sister and I came here intending to quarrel, but you'd went and gone away. Really? Heaven's name, why? We hated everyone who ever had charge of us before, so we made up our minds to hate you. I took a knife to my stepfather. That's why we were sent to England. I surprise you, Sir. You unspeakably shock me. Have you ever seen a man beat your sister? Why are you telling me all this? Because you're kind, and I'm grateful to you. And I mean to play the game by you. Only, you'll have to make allowances for my violent temper. I'm sure I'll try to.. Shall we go in? Yes. Just one question, Sir. Please. This Mr. Edwin Drood, is Miss Bud a relation with his? No, but they are soon to be married. So that's it. Thank you. ♪ To follow where my heavy heart would be ♪ ♪ Lord, tell my love ♪ ♪ O'er land or see ♪ ♪ What I want with him ♪ ♪ Eternally ♪ ♪ If I were with him every ♪ It's a triumph of female modesty. Rosa is not used to an audience. Miss Landless, will you get her pack? Go quick, Helena, please. You're such a conscientious, Master Jack, I believe you make her afraid of you. No wonder. No wonder? You'd be afraid of him too, wouldn't you? Not under any circumstances. Jack's gone Rosa. I don't think he liked to be charged of being the monster that frightened you. 10:00. Come my dear. A very Good night to your husbands. But I'm glad you're feeling so much better. Good night, gentlemen. Good night, gentlemen. - Good night. - Thank you for your escort. - Good night. - Come here, ladies, Miss Landless. Have all girls had fits of the vapors? Men never know why. You're lucky to have a sister like Miss Helena. You are luckier being engaged to a girl like Miss Rosa. Cloisterham is a hotbed of gossip. Is it bad form, Sir, to refer to an approaching marriage? Not an ordinary one. Why is yours extraordinary? We don't cross examine people in England. Heavens, I though it was ridiculous about my name. Ridiculous? You ought to be proud of it. I don't know what people are most proud of they care to discuss with strangers. They prefer to call it ridiculous. In England, gentlemen make the rules and mind their own business. And in Ceylon, gentlemen use respect when speaking of their women. Perhaps you'd go back there, clearly you don't belong here. Ned, Ned, Ned. What's wrong here? Nothing worth repeating, Jack. Just a little exhibition of Ceylonese manners. Ned! Mr. Landless is a stranger here. We are his hosts. I ask for no allowances from you or anyone. Young blood, hot blood. Now come, we should drink a toast to each other in my bachelor gatehouse. Now what can two people who have only just met find to quarrel about? Obviously nothing. Now, there has been no quarrel. You will be a friend to me, won't you Rosa? I need a friend. Helena, I'm terrified. Mr. Jasper? He haunts my thoughts like a dreadful ghost! When I am undressed, I feel as he were looking through the wall at me. No, no, Rosa. I know it's absurd. But I feel as if I was never safe from him. When I play, he never takes his eyes from my hands, and when I sing he never takes his eyes from my lips. Tonight it was even worse, as if he were threatening. Threatening what? Threatening who? I don't know. I don't even think or wonder. Does Mr. Drood knows how this man affects you? Oh no, no, I couldn't tell him, he loves Jasper. Jasper has done everything for him. I've never told anyone but you. Somehow a glaze comes over his eyes. He seems to wander away into a frightful sort of dream and take me with him. You have been staring at that portrait, Mr. Neville. Yes. It scarcely flatters the original. Don't be hard upon it, it was done by Ned. If I'd known I was in the artist's presence... Oh, just a little sketch of mine, Sir. I am sorry, Mr. Drood. Here. If Rosa's a good girl, one of these days I'll do a real portrait of her. One you may approve of. Come, Mr. Neville, we'll drink to Ned. Mr. Neville. Ned. You and I aren't so lucky, are we Mr. Neville? It may not be as fine as all that. Maybe we won't hit it off. Eh, Rosa. It might have been better for Mr. Drood to have known some hardships. Yes. And may we know why? It might have made him more sensible of good luck. Have you ever known hardship may I ask? I have. And what's it made you sensible of? I told you once before... You've done nothing of the sort. Then I'll tell you now, your vanity is intolerable. Your conceit is beyond endurance. You talk as if you were some rare and precious prize, you don't deserve... Oh, so that's what it is. We English don't encourage fellows with dark skin to admire our girls. You. Ned! Jack, Jack! He meant murder. No, he dropped the knife. We were both drunk. Mr. Crisparkle I... You're not sober, Neville. I'm afraid not, Sir. I've just done something terrible. Well? You see, I admire Miss Rosa, Sir, so very much. I just can't bear her to be treated with conceit or indifference. What did you do? Drood insulted me. Grossly. I've lost my temper. And... And I drew a knife on him. Neville. What's to be done with you? I love Rosa, Sir. Do you realize what you're saying? I love her with all my heart. But she and Drood are to be married almost at once. He's not worthy of her. - He talks of her as... - Neville, you must learn to fight down this sudden infatuation. No good can come of it. Good night. I'm sorry. All right, but it's no use being sorry if you don't learn to control your temper. Go to your room and try to sleep. Jasper, won't you come in? No thank you, Crisparkle? I've come to return Mr. Neville's hat. It's no fault of his that he did not kill my nephew. He's very repentant. I dread to think what may happen when those two come together again. - Good night. - Jasper! We must keep this quarrel tonight a secret. I assure you, I would be the last to wish it known. He looked wildly at the wall, caught sight of the knife and whipped it out of its sheath. The young heathen! Left and right, he's slashing around with his knife. Inflicting a wound on Mr. Jasper's forearm. And just grazing Mr. Drood's heart. Perfectly scandalous man, he threw a knife and fork at Mr. Drood. Then he ups with the decanter and he throws that at Mr. Drood. It seems that Miss Landless' brother threw a complete dinner set at Mr. Drood. 128 pieces? What will Rosa do? That's all there was to it. You understand Miss Rosa? I wanted to be the first to tell you about this quarrel. That's kind of you, Mr. Landless. I know how you must feel. And how you must blame me, Why only you? But I lost my temper. Eddie can be too provoking. He often makes me cross. I won't let it happen again. Promise? Yes. I promise. You can apologize, can't you? Apologize? You can't ask that of him, Rosa. But think, unless they make it up, we shan't all see each other. Be friends. Of course I'll apologize. I promise you I shall. I can't let you go to Egypt remembering the worst of me. My poor Neville. She forgave me. Being a particularly angular man who doesn't fit into the social circle, I'm not used to giving anything away, least of all a young lady on her wedding. But Mr. Grewgious, you're Rosa's guardian. Between now and next week there isn't time to find a substitute. If you won't give me away no one else shall. My apprehension is a little dull but that seems to settle it. I have now a personal trust to discharge. My dear Miss Rosa. Though I know nothing of the softer side of life, yet I feel that the wishes of the dead who loved you both, are worthy of your attention. Your mother as she lay dying took this ring from her finger. "Give this," she charged me, “to Mr. Drood's boy. “Tell him to place it on Rosa's finger “if he have so deeply, truly, with all his heart. "If not, command him from the dead "to give the ring back to you." I accept the responsibilities, Sir. Oh isn't it beautiful? Did my father give it to her? On the day they then first plighted their faith. Hard man as I am, I should hate to see such a trust to the living, Rosa, and the dead, your mother, abused. Bless my soul. I thank you, my dear. The honor is almost equal to the pleasure. Good morning. Oh, Eddie you are a darling. From now on we're brother and sister. Never to be husband and wife. Never. Of course you're right. I've known it too but I've tried not to admit it to myself. But it's natural we should both feel sorry. But how much better this way? Now we can always like each other. Always. Rosa. Are you interested in Neville Landless? He's certainly not interested in me. He doesn't call at the school anymore. Don't you know why? He loves you, and then he thinks we were to be married, don't you see? Do you really think that's it? I know it, our quarrel started because he felt that I wasn't good enough for you. You won't quarrel anymore will you? Why should we? And you'll make it up? Of course. Your old Jack's arranging a little peace on earth supper for Neville and me. I'm so glad. Rosa. If you love him, I wish you both luck. What will the girls say? What will all Cloisterham say? Next week's wedding called off, what will be the gossip? Poor Jack is gonna take this hard. Let's not tell him yet, let's not spoil his Christmas. All right. One must give the ring back to Mr. Grewgious. No I won't, I'll keep it a while. Then if you and Neville should come to an understanding... Oh, Eddie for the first time I very much want to kiss you. Good evening, Durdles. Whom you've come to bury, Mr. Choirmaster? Why don't you remember, Durdles? You promised me to take me around the crypts by moonlight. It's a wonder you ain't tired of the cathedral. I am a bit of an antiquary. I have an eye for beauty and a mind to see the spirits at midnight. You bring the spirits and Durdles of your own. I noticed it was a cold night. It's always a cold night to Durdles. Here, taste them spirits. Better than you can get in the taproom. Even stronger, I'll get me keys. Why, Durdles, you're undermined with pockets. They opens the crypts. They opens the monuments. And they opens the way to the tower. And they opens the cathedral. Mr. Choirmaster, these gravestones, all mine. You're like a popular orchestra surrounded by his works. Come on, Durdles. Widdy widdy wen! Widdy widdy wen, I catches! Widdy widdy why, then you don't go. And I cry, widdy widdy why! Get over here, what are you doing? Making a cockshy out of him. Give me that stone. That's Deputy, I give him a penny to stone me home at night. When I drink, it's the only way I can get home at all. See? And now you leave me alone. Away with you now. Durdles has a reason to be out on the town tonight. This way, Mr. Jasper. I gave that boy an object in life. Not a person, nor a window, nor a horse, nor a dog, nor a cat, nor a bird, nor a fowl, nor a pig. What that boy has in stone for want of an enlightened object. Now he's stoned you. Ay, Durdles give him three pence a week. I'm wondering if he has no competitors for the job. He has plenty but he stones them all away. This is me house. Well, that's lime, Mr. Jasper. What you call quick-lime? Ay, quick enough to eat your bones. Anything new down here, Durdles? This ain't no place for novelty. You're always finding more holders. There was an old one. An archbishop. Durdles find him last Michaelmas. Slides right into his coffin with a big. And there he lies. And he gives Durdles a look with his open eyes as much as to say I've been looking for you for a devil of a long-time. And then he turned into dust. What I dwell upon most is the remarkable efficacy with which you seem to find where people are buried. Is that so? Durdles will show you. Here's the whole flock of the old ones. You pitch a note when you sing, don't you? Right. Just so, so Durdles sounds his notes. Empty. Solid. Still solid. What's in here? That? Empty. Come on Durdles, you'll freeze here. Oh, Durdles no freeze. Where does this lead to? That's the way to the Tower. Sleepy? Strongest of the. You stay here, I'll find my way to the belfry. Wake up Durdles! Durdles, it's past 1:00. Why didn't you wake me? I couldn't. We'd better take this with us, come on, let's hurry, it's late. Nothing like this has ever happened to Durdles before. Widdy widdy wen! That's him again. You were watching us I wasn't. I was getting home, I've got to get my money and be out after 10. He's been spying on us. Don't hurt the boy, Mr. Jasper, Thank you, Durdles. Good night. I'll get even with him, so help me I will. Me if I don't.

Let me venture to suggest to the very Reverend, the Dean, that Cloisterham has never seen such a storm during my incumbency as Mayor. The powers of evil seem to have been abroad last night. Crisparkle, Crisparkle, Crisparkle! Yes, yes, Sir. Crisparkle, where is my nephew? How should I know? But he he left my house last night with Neville Landless. Mr. Sapsea, my nephew is missing. Calm yourself my dear, Sir. No one has ever stayed missing since I was Mayor. Beg your pardon, Sir, is Mr. Landless that dark, foreign looking young gentleman? Yes. Ay, I've seen him. Across the bridge to the high road, eh. When I whispered m'lamps out. A bundle he had. - Was he alone? - Aye. He's run away. Nonsense, he's gone on a walking tour. Are you a pack of thieves? - I won't surrender! - Stop like this! He's here, Your Honor. Bring him in. Bring him in. Neville! I demand to know the meaning of all this! There's blood on his stick. I was attacked by these men for no earthly reason. He had it with him last night in my house. In Heaven's name what does this mean then? What's what I want to know. Silence, let us proceed in order, As for the blood, your worship, We gave him an opportune, he gave us as good as he got. There, the blood's explained and everything else will be. Neville. Mr. Landless, where is Edwin? Edwin? Isn't he at home? What have you done with Ned? When did you last see him, my boy? We went down to the river to watch the storm. Yes? Yes. We said goodnight at a fork in the road. Which way did Edwin go? He started back to his uncle's. Why did you run away? I didn't run away, why should I run away? What are you trying to insinuate against my brother? Now let us proceed in order. Now, Sir, why did you leave Cloisterham in wind like this for a walking tour? An excellent question, Mr. Sapsea. Why did you? I wanted to see the country. Very suspicious. May I ask him a question, Your Honor? Go ahead. Mr. Neville, in my presence a few nights ago, did you or did you not raise a knife against Ned? I did. A knife? Mm, most UN-English! But last night we made up our quarrel, we parted friends. What was your quarrel about? That I shan't tell you. The case has a dark look. I have a mind to get out a warrant and commit him to jail under grave suspicions. You can't get out a warrant without evidence, but I will hold myself responsible to produce Mr. Landless if required. Why should Ned have disappeared? Is it likely he returned to the river alone and was drowned? We will search the river. You will lead the search to help find Edwin, Mr. Landless. Gladly. Mr. Jasper is out of his mind with distress. Miss Bud is right. In my distracted state of mind, I have been hasty. Mr. Neville must have an opportunity to prove his innocence. At least he can show us the spot where he parted from my poor boy last night. Let us go. Come Neville. Thank you for your trust in me. I understand why you went away, Helena told me. For the same reason I'll spare no effort to find the man you love. There he is. Front, as soon as we get some hot drink in we'll push on again. He could take us to the right spot if he would. If you ask him perhaps he'll stop for something to eat. Neville! Come to the fire, you're wet and cold. I don't mind that. There's nothing else to mind. As long as you believe in me. We all believe in you. Except Mr. Jasper. Rosa, what do you think happened? I daren't think. That's why we got to go on searching. I found something. What is it, Crisparkle? Look what we found. Ned, his... He's dead. My boy is dead. Who is it? I can't see anyone. It's Mr. Grewgious. Poor master Edwin, sir... Let him come in. This is strange news. Strange and fearful news. How is Miss Rosa? You may imagine her condition. Have you seen his sister? Whose? The suspected young man. Do you suspect him? I can't make up my mind. Nor I. But you spoke of him as the suspected young man. I thought you had made up your mind. Mr. Jasper, I have a communication to make that will surprise you. At least it surprised me. What is it? I might have guessed sooner, but it never occurred to me. What is it? Your nephew was my ward, although so long betrothed and so near to be married. Made up their minds only yesterday that they were not meant to be husband and wife. Not... They broke their engagement and parted firmly on the evening when you last saw them together. Miss Rosa, should I show Mr. Jasper out here? Why, why did you say I was in? Well, Miss, seeing the other young ladies have all gone to the picnic and you so lonesome like I thought. I have been waiting for sometime to be summoned back to my duty near you. You didn't forget them. The duty of teaching you music. I have left off that study. Not left off, discontinued. I'm resolved to leave off. Dearest Rosa, charming Rosa... I do not wish to hear you. We cannot always do as we wish without harming others. I do not forget how many windows command a view of us. I will not touch you again. Sit down. My beloved. There will be no mighty wonder in your music-master's leaning idly on a sundial in talking brief. Rosa. Even when my dear Edwin was a fiancée to you, I loved you. In the distasteful work of the day or wandering from the paradises and hell into which I rushed carrying your image, I loved you madly. Had the ties between me and my dear boy been less strong, I might have swept even him from your side. What do you mean? Judge for yourself whether I shall allow another man to love you. I have devoted myself to discovering Edwin's murderer. I have worked patiently to widen the net around him. It is slowly winding as I speak. I know Mr. Landless is innocent. Circumstantial evidence will accumulate so strong, lady, even against an innocent man that it may slay him. So. We're clear enough. Rosa, I give you my fidelity to my dear dead boy. I give you my vengeance, my peace, my despair if only you will give me yourself and in exchange I give you Neville Landless' life. Because I love you, I love you, I love you. Never, never! Neville! Oh Neville, I'm afraid. You're trembling. You're in danger. Who frightened you like this? Jasper said that if I refused his love, he'll send you the gallows. And you came to warn me. To save me, why? Why? Because I love you. You knew, didn't you? That I wished. Yes, but tell me. I couldn't speak because Edwin was here. Now I mustn't because he isn't here. Our engagement was broken. Broken? I was going to tell you at Christmas. Edwin knew that you and I loved each other, he was going to give you the ring. What ring? My mother's ring. He took it with him to his death. The death I'm supposed to have caused. Don't say that. Everybody thinks so. But you and I know it isn't true. You and I can't fight the whole world. Why not? I wouldn't let you share my humiliation. Everywhere I go people whispering behind my back, "There goes the murderer of Edwin Drood." Oh my dear... Rosa, I'm going away. But that will seem like a confession of guilt. Trust me, it's for the best. If I go Jasper will have no hold over you. But you'll come back. Not until I've been able to prove to the whole world that I didn't kill Edwin Drood. Mr. Sapsea, there's been a miscarriage of justice! Impossible. I've never left my desk Mr. Mayor, I promised to produce Neville Landless, remember he was wanted. I'm therefore bound in honor to inform you that he has left my house without a word to anyone. When did he leave? When we went in to call him this morning his bed had not been disturbed. It's a confession of his guilt. The Law has permitted a murderer to escape. The Law can do nothing without a corpus delicti. Then you still propose to do nothing? Do nothing! I shall allow him the county. I shall notify London. I shall bring this fellow Landless back in chains, held as a material witness. Most quiet room you'll find mister, mister... Datchery. Mr. Datchery. From the eyes of bishop's palace but you'll have a fine view. - Good morning. - Mrs Tope. That's Mr. Jasper. Him with the tragedy. And it'll be 40 shillings a month. That's all. Of course you heard how Drood was made away with... So many people are constantly making away with so many other people. There, 20 shillings in advance. Thank you. That's Mr. Jasper playing now. All he has in life is music and tracking down his nephew's murderer. Even if he's sworn to death. - Are you alone? - Alone deary. Why, it's you Mr. Roorich! Well you show surprise. You kept away a long time. You're in mourning too, why didn't you come for a little bit of comfort? Or did they leave you money and so you didn't want no comfort? Hurry will you? Who was it has died, deary? A relative. Died of what, lovey? Death. Short and snappish we are. You'll want a little bit? Hurry, please. Comfy all over doesn't it, deary? We'll do now have a little forgetfulnesses, we will. You learned your lesson in London very well. You make a most convincing old gentleman, Mr. Datchery. I must be convincing. It's my only hope to clear myself. I discovered these in a secret place in his room. I never had much power of deduction but these undoubtedly prove Mr. Jasper to be, as I had surmised, an addict to some drug. Do you advise me to return them where I found them? As a straightforward man, I'm used to plotting. I would suggest that you keep them. Mr. Grewgious, you claim that you're cold and dense but you've helped and heartened me as only a true friend could. Nonsense, I'm a hard man, I hate to see the wrong man hanged. If he isn't it'll be thanks to you. What do you make of that? A wax mold. Now if I were imaginative, which of course I'm not, I'd say that someone had been trying to get into some place that he shouldn't. Why, this key must be heavy enough to... To open a tomb. Pleasant dreams, deary? Over and over again. All over again. All over again. Always in the same way? Always in the same way. Hundred of thousands of times I've done it. It's to be hoped it was pleasant to do. It was. Pleasant to do. So often I'd done it, but when it was really done it seemed not worth the doing. It was done so soon. So soon. Ned. Ned. Ned! Ned! Oh my boy! My boy! Why didn't you kill me? Why? Rosa. Rosa. You'd do anything to get her you keep talking about, wouldn't you? Rosa. She's mine. She's mine. No one shall have her but me. What was I doing? Strangling me you was, you can't go round strangling people without paying for it. There's your money. Silver! And you're a paying it seems. Oh, be quiet! I'll not miss ya, Mr. Roorich. I'll not miss ya twice. Edwin Drood. Edwin. Ned. John Jasper, 200 pounds. Mr. Roorich, Mr. Roorich! Are you looking for anybody? I've come to find Mr. Roorich. There is no Mr. Roorich. What are you giving me? I've just seen him come in. That was Mr. Jasper. He who offers the reward? The same. Roorich, Jasper. Then it's Jasper that I come to see. Has he a calling, good gentleman? Calling? Yes, he sings in the choir. In the spire? In the Cathedral. With a bishop over him? A dean. High and mighty dean! What might be interested to know... Yes? Nothing, deary, thank you. If you want to see Mr. Jasper now, here's the stairways to his room. Oh, you don't want to see Mr. Jasper now? No, I changed me mind. Help a poor old woman, dear gentleman. Help a poor soul. What's troubled with a grievous cough. It was here in Cloisterham. A young gentleman gave me three and six, I wanted the money to lay out on some medicines. What medicines? Something that makes you forget. It was last Christmas Eve just after dark, once when I was here before. That the young gentleman give me the three and six. And the young gentleman's name was Jack. And I told him it's better than Ned. Because Ned is a name. Do you know that? A guinea, a golden guinea. All of them just as golden. If you wait in here for five minutes. No, no don't hurry me through the public streets, it's not my personal dignity, the dignity of my office as mayor. Now, haven't we'd better send for Mr. Jasper? Later, later the representative of the Queen's Authority should hear her first. Queen's? Oh, yes, yes, yes of course, the Queen's authority. Yes, yes, exactly. It shall all be done in order. Let nothing be touched. - Mrs Tope, no emotions. - No sir. Tope, summon the coroner. What's happened here? Dead. Dead. Who is she? She came here asking for you. For me? I don't know her. She said that she knew something about Edwin Drood. About Ned? - Ned. - My nephew. That explains why she asked for me. Did she tell you anything? No. One thing at a time. Law must determine how this woman died. There's blood on the under-iron. She was killed, when she came in. She must had a seizure and struck her head there. I had myself reached that conclusion. The coroner, Sir. An accident Mr. Coroner, I have determined the cause. You'll ascertain the identity of this poor creature. You can't come in here. Can't come in here. I'll bet Mr. Jasper done her in. Why, you. Arrest that brat! Widdy widdy wen, I bet Mr. Jasper done her in! Widdy widdy wen, I bet Mr. Jasper done her in! Widdy widdy wen, I bet Mr. Jasper done her in! He threw a stone at me once, and I punished him. Yes, yes, of course, of course. Widdy widdy wen, I did! Come here. Don't you wish you could attack me? See that six pence. Come now. What made you tell that lie about Mr. Jasper? Because he tried to choke me once, murder on his face. Why? Because one night him and Durdles come out of the Cathedral. Way down they was in the cellars. Hours and hours. I waited for them and he said I was spying on him. When was this? I don't know. I know that it occurred before the great storm. You know Mr. Durdles? Do I knows him? I stoned him. You take me to him now and I'll give you a shilling. Come on then. Widdy widdy wen! You owe me a tuppence. I do not. Hello, who be you? I've been told that Mr. Durdles knows more than the Dean about the fine Norman crypts in your cathedral. You another of them Antiquarians? Could you take me down in those crypts tonight? I take any gentleman as brings liquor for two. Or even liquor for one. I'll bring it along about 10. Why anyone wants to go down amongst the dead ones at night, beats Durdles. Wary that lime, Datchery. Where? By your foot. It's gone, that's weird. Durdles ain't done no work down here since that lime was brought down. Mr. Jasper gave me the bottle beforehand. That's a singular key? Only one of its kind. Mr. Jasper gave me the bottle beforehand. Let's go on. That's were I slipped, when I was showing Mr. Jasper around. I'd had a pint by then. Did you sleep long? Long enough to dream. It seems I could hear Mr. Jasper's footsteps going through them gates. Why shouldn't he? How could he go through the gates who was locked when Durdles has the only key? Weird things happen in threes. Lovely, yes, lovely. Is it true that you can tell by the sound of your hammer where the dead are buried? Durdles will show. Some of them have got old ones in them and some ain't. Listen. Solid. Why should some tombs be empty? Iotted by Richard III in the War of the Roses, I've heard tell. Now this is an empty one. Now you listen to the difference in the sound, hollow like! Sounds the same to me. It was empty. Durdles told Mr. Jasper so. Durdles never makes mistakes. Isn't this fresh plaster? Give me your hammer. What's that? Why that's the strike with lime? Go to the Mayor's house, bring Mr. Sapsea here and Mr. Brewgious. And Mr. Crisparkle, tell them to hurry. What's this all about? Tell them I think I found Edwin Drood. Why are you opening this tomb? If it contains what I think it does, the murderer of Edwin Drood is found. Then you know where Neville Landless is? I do. Then why not produce him? And you shall have the reward whether you find Edwin Brood or not. But you see Mr. Jasper, Neville Landless did not kill Edwin Drood. This way! - Very strange. - Almost unimaginable. I'm a dense man, but I believe. Ah! Positively disgraceful, is it not? It's Mr. Jasper! Neville! I followed him here. Arrest this man! What does this mean your being found here? Look in that tomb. Just a few bones. Quick lime has done the rest. The identification is impossible. I venture to disagree. I gave this ring to Mr. Drood the day he disappeared, just before his engagement to Miss Rosa was broken. You remember Mr. Jasper? Landless came back here to get the ring. Mr. Durdles and the boy Deputy will be the chief witnesses against the murderer of Edwin Drood. Them footsteps no dream. Them spirits. The quick-lime, you used it. The tomb empty, you filled it. He's locked it! Arrest that man, arrest him, I say! Sound the alarm! Be sure and sound the alarm! Ned, Ned. What have I done, what have I done, what have I done? What have I done? So soon. Rosa. The journey is made. Rosa. Mrs Landless! Widdy widdy wen! Here!
