Stefano, the boss wants you. -Where is he? -He's over there. Thank you. You carry on. -Hello, Stefano. -Good morning, Mr. John. It's for you, it came yesterday from the State Department. What does it say? It's English. Did you apply for a visa to Canada for Maria Dermoz? -Is she your relative? -My fiancée. -No way. -Why? Here in Canada, only relatives of emigrants obtain a visa. But Maria and I are going to get married, she will be my wife. Until you get married, the law considers you two strangers. But if she were my wife, could she stay with me? -Sure. -Then I go to Italy, I'll marry her and bring her here. You don't know if you can come back. Those who leave lose rights. Many workers want to enter Canada. You'll have to start over. Apply, wait your turn… Think about it. So what should we do? I can't wait. -Then do what I did. -What? I too had recently emigrated and in love with a girl. We got married by proxy, she in Italy and me here in Canada. It's kind of a complicated thing. Come by my house afterwards, I'll give you all the information. -Thanks, Mr. Morresi. -We Italians must help each other. -Bye. -Goodbye. Good evening. Mr. Morresi. I have an appointment with him. Excuse me. Mr. Morresi told me to come here tonight. My husband had to leave, but he told me that you would come. -I will give you the information. -Thank you. Come in. Please take a seat. -Would you like a whiskey? A brandy? -It doesn't matter. You need something strong in this weather, I need it too. -You'll like it, it's a good brand. -Thank you, I don't want to disturb. No, I'm glad to be able to have a chat with a compatriot. It happens so rarely that I can speak Italian. And your husband? My husband… And who ever sees him? He's out all day in the woods for his work. He doesn't have time to keep me company. -You want to get married by proxy? -Yes, it's Mr. Morresi's idea. -That's what he did too. -Yeah, we did that. This is the note of the papers that you need from Italy. -Well, then what? -Then you go to the Consulate, your fiancée to the City Hall of her town, -and the marriage is celebrated. -It's very simple. Yes, simple and quick. Too bad that you can't undo it as easily. But if two people love each other, they don't need to divorce. -Another whiskey? -No, thank you. Can I keep it? -Sure, they're for you. -Thank you, madam. You don't want to go out now, do you hear how it's pouring? Stay a little longer, I told you I'd like to talk to someone. I'm always so lonely. Tell me about your girlfriend. How did you meet her? Tell me. It was a night like this. I don't want to hurt you, I'm being chased, I have to hide. -Sorry. -Lisetta! Don't call for help. As soon as I can, I'll leave. It's them. Save me, please. Save me. Hide yourself there. We are looking for a smuggler, he's hiding in one of these houses. -I haven't seen anybody. -We need to do a search. -You two go upstairs. -No, please. Excuse us, but we have to do our duty. Go. -Is there another room over there? -There's our shop. What kind of shop? We sell sewing goods, fabrics, a little bit of everything. -But there can't be anybody there. -It's better to have a look. Get some light. So sorry, we didn't know. Let's go, guys. Good night and excuse us. Thank you, it was very generous what you did for me. They could have arrested you too. I know. -What's there? You're wounded. -It's a shallow wound. -It stings a little bit. -Wait a moment. It's the first time I'm going against the law. I needed money and I agreed to smuggle. -Does it hurt? -Not right now. Bad job this one. Not for me. Thank you. But why did they leave without keep looking for me? Come. My mother. Go now. Go to bed, Lisetta. -No, leave me, I want to stay here. -No, I'll stay. -You're too tired, go to sleep. -No. Come on, let's go. Please excuse me again. If I had known… I am sorry, thank you again for everything. There is no one there, you can go. This life is not for me, it was the first time and it will be the last. And I owe it to you. I thank you for that as well. So, this is how we met the first time. That's how I met her. But I'm boring you. Excuse me, madam. No, I'm very interested. Continue. -Did you meet again right away? -No, some time later. Good morning. -It's you! -You recognized me. I thought that after so long you had forgotten me. Don't worry, this time I'm not being chased by the guards. Do you remember that I promised you that I would become an honest man? I succeeded, but it wasn't easy. The temptation was strong, I could gain a lot with little effort… but I always refused. And if I had the strength to save myself, I owe it to you. Oh, no, you owe it to yourself, to your honesty, to your conscience. My conscience got tired of giving me good advice. And honesty had given me only bitterness and misery. If it hadn't been for you, I would have let myself go. I could no longer forget that night. The shame I felt In front of you, shame on myself, shame of having to hide like a thief. I erased the memory of that night. I've had some bad times, hunger, misery… I finally found a job. A heavy job, but I didn't care about the fatigue. I was happy because I wasn't ashamed of the money I earned. Since then, I'd see her every morning, when Maria appeared on the threshold of the store. -Good morning, Miss Maria. -Good morning. -Enjoy your day. -Thank you. And in the evening, tired after work, I'd go back to see her again. -Good evening, Miss Maria. -Good evening. -Have a good rest. -Thank you. Until one day, a beautiful Sunday in May, I was lucky enough to meet her in the town square. She was looking for her sister. She hadn't found her and she was on her way home. I offered to accompany her, she accepted. We didn't need many words to tell us that we cared for each other. We had told each other many times with our thoughts. And those were happy days… of a full happiness, without end. But I wanted Maria all to myself, forever, so I took courage. And to offer her a better future and be able to realize our dream, I took the grave decision. -I just quit my job. -Why? They were paying me so little, just enough for me. Then I informed myself and I did the paperwork. I want to go to America to work for you. -And you want to leave me? -Yes, but only for a little time. -I will work very hard to succeed. -How long will you be gone? I don't know, but they offered me a very good place. -And where is that? -In Canada. I have to pass the medical check, but I'm sure they will accept me. -So far away. -Don't be scared. I'll come back with a bundle of pounds or dollars. We'll have a big wedding and a little house just for us. Yes, Stefano, but in the meantime I'll be alone. Happiness must be earned. Are you happy? Yes. If you're happy, so am I. See you soon, Maria. -Write to me. -You too. -Come back soon. -I'll give you my address! There, that's our story. Interesting. A romantic and adventurous story, very entertaining. Excuse me, I told it to you because you asked me to. I had no intention to amuse you. Pay no attention to my words. But love stories don't move me. -I wish you all the best. -I thank you, madam. Thank your husband as well. -Good luck. -Good evening, madam. Maria! I'm here! Good morning, Madam Countess, here is the fabric you asked for. -We agreed on yesterday. Sit down. -Thank you. I'm sorry, but I've been so busy. Doing what? Writing to your love? -No, I write to him so little. -That's bad. You have to write to him every day, otherwise he'll forget about you. -What's new? -He's fine. He became a foreman and they doubled his pay. He says if I don't decide to marry him, he'll go back to Italy. And what are you waiting for? My sister is still almost a child and if I left, she would be left to herself. My mother said to me: "I recommend Lisetta to you". "Swear that you will do for her everything I would have done." Those were her last words before she died. I can't, I feel like I'd be breaking my oath. And who says you should abandon your sister? As a relative, she could join you whenever she wants. -Really? -Sure. -Did you bring form and stamp? -Yes, but what's the point of that? It is for your passport, let's do the paperwork right away. Come on, let's sign the other papers so I'll give them to my lawyer. What about Maria's expatriation papers? Everything is proceeding according to your orders, countess. Good. -Madam, Miss Dermoz is here. -Send her through. -Yes, madam. -Mr. Lawyer, you can go. My respects, Countess. -Good morning, Countess. -Miss Maria. We were talking about you. He says that everything is going well. -Sit. -Thank you. -How much trouble you take for me. -Let go. Tell me, what does Lisetta do? She helps me at the store and then she does the housework. Yes, that's fine, but in the evening, after work, -are you sure she doesn't go around? -Who? Lisetta? What are you saying, madam? Lisetta never goes out at night. As soon as the store is closed, she eats something and goes to bed. -But why do you ask? -Nothing, I was just saying that. Lisetta is young, she's pretty. I wouldn't want anyone to… You know? But it's not my business, you watch over her. -You can rest assure. -All the better. -Why? You… -I don't know anything. -Thank you again for everything. -Dario, where are you going? -I'm going to go change. -You look great, come on. -Goodbye. -Goodbye, Madame. -Goodbye. -Goodbye, Mr. Dario. Come, I have to tell you a few words. -Excuse me. -Tell me. I must ask you something. The Countess has instructed me… -Yes, I know. -Your mother's name. -Anna Lanier. -Anna Lanier. Very good. So you want to leave us, it must be a great love. -Yes. -Great love doesn't reason. You could have found a good man. Certainly better than your Stefano, that rascal. -Please. -Are you really in love? -Yes. -It's a shame. The more I look at you, the more I see that it is a real shame. Goodbye. -Your vacation lasted too long. -Why? I don't understand. No? Then it's better to talk to you straight. You have been seen too often with Lisetta, Maria's sister. But nothing bad, we met by chance and then… It's a case that I don't like. Don't forget the name you carry, your position, your father's ideas… I hope we can agree on that. -But I assure you… -Your father entrusted you to me since he moved to Buenos Aires, I am responsible for you, and I don't want you to hang out that peasant girl anymore! -She is not a peasant! -Stop it! You'll go back to Milan and resume your studies! Think about your future and not only to have fun with my money! Do you understand? Yes. -See you soon, Lisetta. -Dario, will you write to me? -Will you always remember me? -I will only think of you. But don't cry now, Lisetta. Smile. This is how I want to leave you and how I want to find you, smiling. You are more beautiful when you smile. -Goodbye, Lisetta. -I'll be waiting for you. -Good evening. -Good evening. You didn't expect to find me here, did you? Yes, in fact, I don't understand. I went for a horseback ride, I saw these shacks and I wondered who was there. The door was open and I went in. -Are you the one who lives here? -Yes, with two of my companions. But now I'm alone because they are on leave. -Please take a seat. -No, thank you. And your wife, when you are married, will she come to live here? No, not in this den. For her I want a comfortable home, with a little garden. -Would you like…? -No, thank you. I already have my eye on one. From the windows you can see the mountains. She'll feel like she is still in her country. -Hopefully. -What's up? -Any difficulty with the wedding? -No, but she's hasn't decided. Really? And why? And who knows? I don't understand anything. She doesn't want to leave her sister because she has the responsibility of her future. But it is absurd that for this she sacrifice our happiness. Yeah, absurd. If that's the real reason. What does it mean? The concern for her sister could be an excuse. An excuse? When John covered me with letters, I invented a thousand reasons to postpone it. But he didn't want to wait. He was afraid of losing me. He was afraid that I would fall in love with another man. -Do you have this fear too? -No. Then why are you in such a hurry to get married? Are you in love? Indeed. Love is a blaze that soon burns out, then nothing remains but ashes, bitterness, regret. You thought my husband and I were happy, but it's not true. We did something stupid and we regret it. Give me something to drink, I'm very thirsty. I'm sorry, I only have a little whisky of very bad quality. -A glass of water. -I'll go get it from the spring. Never mind, I'll drink your whiskey. If you allow, I'll sit down a moment. -You're welcome. -Getting off the horse, -I feel like I'm hurt. -Where? -In the ankle. -Let me see. -Is it here? -Yes. -Do I hurt you? -A little bit. It's nothing, you'll see it will pass right away. I must have lost my mind. -Please forget. -There is nothing to forget. In front of me, Regent of the Italian Consulate of the city of Winnipeg, Canada, comes Mr. Stefano Brunot accompanied by Mr. Morresi Giovanni and Mr. Agostini Francesco as witnesses, to declare his will to marry Miss Maria Dermoz. He has signed the proxy made in accordance to the law. You sign here, the witnesses will sign below. Antonio Ollier, do you take as your lawful spouse, in the name of Stefano Brunot, Maria Dermoz according to the rite of Holy Mother Church? -Yes. -Maria Dermoz, do you wish to marry Stefano Brunot, represented by Antonio Ollier, according to the rite of Holy Mother Church? We got married first in church and then at City Hall. Now instead… -What do we do now? -Nothing, your part is done. -You'd like to be a groom again. -Why not? -Shall we sit down? -Thank you. Here. Have a seat. Sit right here, dear. What's the matter, Lisetta? You're crying. No, don't mind that, I'm so happy for you. Silence, please. I propose a toast. Silence! To the bride and to the distant bridegroom, our best wishes and our applause. -My God! Take her up, please. -Yes, slowly. Poor girl… Let's hope it's nothing. -How is she doing? -Is she feeling better? -She's doing better. -I'm going to go see her. No, thank you, she is sleeping now, let her rest. She just had a little malaise. -If you need anything, tell me. -Thank you very much. -Go, thank you. -Goodbye, dear. -Goodbye. -Goodbye. -Goodbye and best wishes. -Thank you. Goodbye. -Goodbye. -Goodbye. Goodbye, madam. Thank you, excuse me. What is it? What's wrong with Lisetta? What does she have? I can tell you, madam. But I recommend, that nobody knows it. -She is pregnant. -What are you talking about? Are you sure? She told me, she's already way ahead. I don't know how she managed to hide it until now. First she didn't want to say anything, but then I insisted… She bursted into tears and confessed everything to me. It's my fault, I didn't know how to watch over her. And my poor mother entrusted me to her before she died. She seemed to predict it. She knew Lisetta was fatuous, light, exposed to a thousand dangers. And she made me swear to assist her. I broke my oath, I abandoned her to herself. I thought only of my own happiness and not hers. -Did she tell you who did it? -No. I begged her, but she doesn't want to answer. I want to see her, maybe she'll tell me more. Thank you, madam, you talk to her. Let her understand that I want to know for her sake. Because if the man she loves is honest and really loves her, -will be ready to do his duty. -Yes, of course. Come on, calm down. It was my nephew, wasn't it? Yes. And of course he promised to marry you. Yes. -Does he know you're pregnant? -No. Since he left, he hasn't written to me anymore. Please tell him yourself. I had faith in him, but now help me. Rest assured, I will help you, dear. But on one condition. No one must know anything of your love. It will be better for him and for you. Not even your sister. Promise? -Yes, I promise. -Everything will work out. Thank you. -This is the room, but I can't… -I'm his grandmother. -I pay his bills. -At this hour he wants to sleep. -Get out of the way. -What manners! -Dear grandma, what a surprise! -Don't touch me. My visit is a little early, isn't it? It's barely 11 o'clock. If I had known… Last night I was late, but to study. Yes, I can see the object of your studies. -Yeah, but believe me, I don't… -You'd be better off shutting up. I came to tell you my decisions and I'm in a hurry. I have to leave in an hour. Sit down. Come on, sit down. Listen to me well. Tomorrow a plane leaves to Buenos Aires. You have 24 hours to pack your bags and say goodbye to your studies. -What are you talking about? -I have spoken plainly. You are leaving for Argentina. Your passport is here. This is the ticket. Your father will pick you up at the airport. Here's some money for you. How much do you owe? -It's quite a lot. -Here, this must be enough for you. -But you're going to explain… -Do you also want an explanation? Here you waste your time and my money pretending to study. I love you very much, but you can't continue like this. -But I swear to you that I… -No, I'm tired of your promises and of paying your debts! And then your father needs you, he always writes that. Didn't you say that you wanted to see him? Yes, but not now, all of a sudden…. Ah, no, right away. And don't try to trick me, because it would be over for you. Do we understand each other? All right, I'm going to leave. By the way, I have the tailor to pay. I forgot. -Those are the last ones. -Thank you. Thank you, Grandma. I'll get dressed in a minute and I'll take you to the station. We must find out who he is, Lisetta says that he will marry her. We'll find him, but in the meantime we have to keep it hidden. Keep it hidden from everyone, you know how people are. People. And when it's born, how are we going to keep it hidden? We will find a way. But also for your good name, for your husband, no one has to know anything. Agnese has been many years at my service, is a woman who knows how to keep a secret. She lives far away, a place where no one ever comes. Far away from me too then. No, I don't want to. Don't be selfish, Maria, think about your husband. You'll be able to visit her. Carefully, without drawing attention. -What if they ask me about her? -We'll find an excuse. That she went to work in the city, for example. -Yes, you're right. Thank you. -See you soon, dear. Lisetta has found a good place with a family and is happy. Why did she leave so suddenly? We had established this a while ago, she had a good opportunity -and she didn't want to miss it. -When will you leave for Canada? -I haven't decided yet. -What are you waiting for? Now that you've settled your sister, don't you want to join your husband? Yes, but we need more documents, it's a long process. Good morning, Madam. -Good morning. -Goodbye, Maria. Everyone asks me where Lisetta is and what she does and then why I don't leave! I'm tired of having to constantly lie and to smile with despair in my heart. You are right, dear. I decided to tell the truth to Stefano, it's better if he knows. I wrote him this letter. -It seems imprudent to me. -Why? Stefano will understand. Yes, he will believe and he will lose some of the esteem he has for you. Maybe he'll think that you're hiding something more serious from him. Don't forget that he's alone there, far away from you. God knows what he is capable of imagining. Then you advise me not to tell him anything? If I were you, I would do that. So far he hasn't heard anything, might as well continue. It will be easy to find a reason why you postponed your departure. And once you're down there, you'll tell him. Yes, I'll do as you say. And when is the baby due? These days, it's been more than a week that I can't go up there. The torrent in flood has dragged the bridge away. I'll try again tonight. Even if I'd have to climb up the mountain, I want to pass. Lisetta! My darling! What's wrong? Are you in pain? Look at me, I'm Maria. Maria, I'm so cold. Be good, dear, I'm going to cure you now. You finally came, I told you that it was a matter of days. -You came too late. -I couldn't get through. The road was cut off by the flood. But Lisetta is very sick. No need to worry, a little fever. She has been in a lot of pain, leave her quiet. When she sleeps, she doesn't suffer. And where is the child? -Dead. -Dead? -How dead? Come on, speak up! -What do you care to know? When children are born in these conditions, it's better to get them out of the way right away. It's better for them and for those who gave birth to them. It is not true that he is dead. Where is the child? Speak up! I did what needed to be done, I'm familiar with these. I've had this happen before and it went well. What have you done? Speak up! Did you kill him? No, I entrusted him to providence. What do you mean? Explain yourself. I took him to church this morning, it was dawn. As soon as they opened, I went in without being seen. I hid him in the confessional. When they see him, if he's alive, they'll take him to the orphanage. If instead the Lord took him back… -In which church? -In the church of San Lorenzo. What do you want to do? Wait! What a shock! I was going to kneel down, when I saw a bundle on the step. I got closer, I touched and felt something move. -Was the child still alive? -Yes, alive. We had him taken to the local doctor, but he is so small, who knows if he can survive. -No one saw anything? -No. There was no one there. Must be some victim of a guilty love. She took a big risk, she ends up in jail for sure. -And for a long time. -Oh, Lord. Can we go to the sacristy? I should take some notes. Yes, please, marshal, have a seat. -No, no! -Let's go. -I haven't done anything! -Come on. -Don't scream like that. -Leave me! -Let's go. -I'm innocent, I swear to you! -I didn't do anything! -Let's go. -Assassin! -Are you perhaps without sin? Leave me, I am innocent. Here we are at last. He said to wait a moment. You can't get the communication? The communication was right, but no one showed up. -No one? -Can I turn the radio back on? Yes, anyway… How is it possible that no one showed up? -Was Maria notified in time? -Yes, of course. It's strange, but it's also possible that she couldn't. But why? That's what I'm wondering. Even if she couldn't move, she could have sent Lisetta. -What could have happened? -Nothing, a mishap. -Not to be alarmed. -Of course I'm alarmed. I've been waiting so many months, I thought she'd leave right away and instead difficulties and complications began. Documents that don't arrive, the business to be settled, the house to sell, and so the whole summer passed. Now that she seemed to have made up her mind, suddenly she doesn't write anymore. She doesn't answer my telegrams, I have her called on the phone and no one shows up. -I don't understand. -She may have regretted it. -Repented of what? -Of getting married. -It can happen, can't it? -What are you saying, Laura? -Don't listen to her. -No, the lady is right. But then why not tell me? Enough, I can't go on living in this uncertainty. I want to know the truth. -It's you, Countess. -Maria. -How is Lisetta? -Stay calm. -Tell me how she's doing. -She's better, just a little weak. -She doesn't know that I'm here. -She doesn't. In her condition, I preferred to hide the truth from her. Is she really better? Last time it seemed to me…. But now let's talk about you. Did they question you? -Yes. -And what did you say? -I don't remember anything anymore. -But you have to remember. I must know everything in order to help you. -You didn't accuse your sister. -No, I never mentioned her. Good, you did well, you have to keep silent. But they will believe me guilty and will condemn me. You'll have a good lawyer and they will acquit you. -You didn't do anything. -No, nothing. I know that well. So there is no advantage in telling the truth, Agnese would deny it and poor Lisetta would be in the way. Courage, I'm sure you'll be acquitted. -What if Stefano finds out? -What? The truth? I mean, what you did and why did you do it? -But he will love you even more. -Do you think so? Sure. In fact, if you want I'll write him and tell him everything. -No, I'll write to him. -You can't, dear. Don't forget that letters here are censored. Poor Lisetta would be immediately arrested. And your husband would see on the letter the header of the prisons. No, I'll write to him, give me his address. And you will write to him when this story is over forever. Yes. Stefano Brunot, Winnipeg, Canada. Mountain Park. Tell him that I love him, that I think only of him. -Don't doubt. -And how is the child? -Good, he is strong, healthy. -But where is he? -With me. -But why do you do all this for me? Because I love you, dear. -Just for affection, nothing else. -Thank you. This is not a common crime of abandonment of an infant, crime for which sometimes one can invoke the clemency of the judges. The case of Maria Dermoz is different. Maria Dermoz is the woman, unworthy and distorted, who in order to hide the truth, the so-called dishonor, disposes of the fruit of a guilty love and abandons a newborn child which, as you have noted from the medical reports, risked of dying from the cold and from lack of nutrition. It's your stubborn silence that nails you to your responsibilities, that nails you to your responsibilities, Maria Dermoz, and that forces me to invoke not an undeserved pity, but an exemplary punishment. Finds the defendant Maria Dermoz guilty of child abandonment of attempted infanticide and sentences her to 1 year and 6 months of prison plus court costs and sentence fees. Straight. Hold. Done. If she is so sick, why didn't you call the doctor? You told me not to tell anyone. I told you not to gossip, not to let her die without care. -Call Dr. Guerlas. -Right away? Yes, right away. And tell him to come immediately! Quickly! Don't get excited. Poor Lisetta. Dario! Where are you? Why did you abandon me? And where is my baby? I want him, he's mine. Forgive me, Lisetta. I'm so cold… -Yes, that's fine. -Good morning, Mr. Consul. -Good morning. Have a seat. -Thank you. I got your card last night and I took this morning's train. -Well, any news? -Yes. A report from the Prefecture. -It's about Maria Dermoz. -Well? She's in prison. In prison? Maria? -But why? -She has been condemned to one year and six months. Read. I asked for a more detailed report, but she wasn't worthy of you. She lied to me. She deceived me. How is it possible? You didn't have time to know her, you were wrong about her. You trusted her, but maybe it was for the best. My advice is not to despair too much, given the case. It is not right to ruin your future for someone who doesn't deserve it. You can ask for the annulment of the marriage. Yes, of course. It's a very painful time for you, I understand that. It is useless that I try to comfort you. I wish you to find another woman truly worthy of you. Worthy to be the companion of your life. Another woman. And how can I love her as I loved Maria? She was everything to me, she was my very life. Your husband has petitioned to the court to obtain the annulment of the marriage. It was granted. -You have to sign for consent. -Marriage annulment? -Stefano asked for an annulment? -What did you want him to do? Then he didn't believe me either. He is also convinced that I am guilty. He doesn't want me anymore. No one can force you to sign, but even if you refuse, cancellation is granted anyway. Your opposition will be ignored. It's over. If you want to take my advice, sign. You can't think that he might take you back with him. Come on, make up your mind. Here. First and last name. Do you hear the bells? At this time people go to church. I used to go to church when I was a little girl and I was so happy. Stop crying, sleep. You don't think when you sleep. And it feels better. Now, dear friends, enjoy yourselves, I have to take care of the others. Friends, a moment of attention. I have a surprise for you. Now you will hear a song from my country sung by this young man who is a discovery of mine. -A magnificent voice. -Bravo. -An Italian song. -Come on, come on. But why did you leave Without saying a word to me? Now for the world, sad and alone, You go lost and without me Stay far away, but I wait for you At all hours and every day And I dream that you come back Because I'm dying to see you And I wait for you I wait for you Like winter waits for the sun Because you are the sun for me But why don't you come back, my life? I always stand behind the windows Sighing for you to come And I tell you that I love you, All my love is you -Good evening, Stefano. -Good evening, madam. -Cover yourself. -Thank you. Why didn't you come to the party? We invited your friends, -all your workmates. -I don't like to see people. -I'd rather be alone. -You are wrong. You should try to entertain yourself, to forget the bad thoughts. There was a little present for you under the tree. Oh yeah? But my Christmas present I already got it. The best present, I couldn't have wanted more. Look. -What is it? -A telegram. I'm free. My marriage has been annulled. I didn't think they would make so soon. It's better this way. -Yes, better that way. -No regrets? No, it is what it is. I don't want to think about it anymore. -I'm leaving. -Are you going back to Italy? No, I'm going north, beyond the Great Lakes. There's a lot to do down there. If you don't lose your skin, you can get rich quick. What do I need wealth for? I am alone, I have no one to make happy, not even myself. Stefano, I'm alone too. Terribly lonely. -Don't leave me here. -What are you talking about? I seem to go crazy in this solitude of woods, of snows. -I want to go away with you. -No, Laura, that would be crazy. A madness we might regret, especially you. No, I won't. I love you, Stefano. I don't ask you to love me. All I will need is to be close to you, help you forget. No, Laura. I can't, I don't want to forget. I need to be alone with my sorrow and with my loneliness. Don't talk, try to forget what you have said, as I will forget. You have a duty to a man who tried to make you happy. You do not have the right to offend him, to humiliate him. One day perhaps you will be grateful to me for preventing you from committing a mistake. Resign yourself to your fate as I resign myself to mine. -Maria Dermoz. -Here I am. I must tell you something. I was told to be gently. It's about your sister, she has been very ill -and now… -Now? She's dead. -She died… -From severe anemia, it seems. My Lisetta… I want to see her! -Leave me! I want to see her! -Stop it! Remember that you're in prison. All in vain. Lisetta died alone. Maria, be strong. PRISON There is a woman who has asked to speak with you. -Who is she? -She said her name is Maria -and that you know her. -No, I don't want to see her. Tell her I'm sick, send her away. But excuse me… Why you don't want to see me? -Sit. -No. I just want the baby. Where is he? He is not here. -He is at the maternity ward. -I've been thinking a lot. -And I finally figured it out. -What? Everything! It all happened because of you. But tell me why! If my sister is dead, it's your fault! -That's not true. -Yours! You sent her to that woman, where she had no cure, -where she died without a doctor. -It was a fatality. You were supposed to write my husband the truth, but you didn't. He asked for the annulment of the marriage, -he didn't know the truth. -It's not my fault if he didn't believe. You have not written a single word, I am sure. You had promised to get me acquitted and instead nothing. You abandoned me to my fate, everyone abandoned me. I was left alone, helpless, under an infamous accusation. All the evidence against me, yet I was innocent, you know it. But it was worth nothing, they gave me the maximum sentence. Like I really wanted to kill that poor creature. -You are crazy. -But why did you do all this? Why did you attack me and my sister? This I have never been able to understand. Why? I forgive you just because you suffered. Suffered… I have lost everything. And I have nothing left in the world other than that child. Go take him back, I will give you all the money you'll need. No, I don't want your money! What do you think you can give me back? Lisetta's life? Stefano's love that I have lost forever? Keep your money and pray to God that he will forgive you! Then go away! Go away! I can only approve of your desire to have the baby, but how will you be able to provide for him? I will keep him with me at all times, I have a small store in my village. It was enough for us to live and it will still be enough for me. And I'll work for him too, like I worked before. I beg you, mother, do not refuse me this grace. I am alone in the world, I have no one. I have nothing but the memory of my family. That child will be the only purpose of my life. And it will seem to me that I am still obeying to my mother's will and to give peace to the blessed soul of my poor sister. Yes, child, you shall have the child. Let him grow up healthy, good, worthy of your affection. And may he not be ashamed of his origin. Come. Children, come here. Be good. -Where is Dermoz's little guy? -The one always asking for his mom? Here he is. Nino! For the interest of the mortgage, you must pay this. Look. It seems right to me. You will also have to pay the Municipality rent arrears, the business tax and finally the fines for being late. It all adds up to… That's it. You just have to do the counting. But how is that even possible? That's a huge amount of money. I can never find so much money. I am sorry for you, but the City and other creditors can also ask for the immediate repossession. As you can see, the situation is quite serious. They're going to kick me out, they will throw me out on the street. As a lawyer, I must act in the best interest of my clients, but as a friend I could help you. Help me? How? Do you remember years ago I gave you some good advice? If you had listened to me, now you would be the respected wife of a lawyer and wouldn't have gone to jail. My admiration has not diminished. Now many things have changed, there was that misfortune, let's call it that way. I got married and I also have a son, but it would not stop me if you wanted to… Do you realize what you're saying? I tell you that I like you, that I've always liked you. That's the truth. Don't be so indignant because that's not the case! Let go of me! -Go away, you rascal! -Do you react like this? All right. Then you pay everything, down to the last lira. And maybe this will make you put your head down. Get out of here! Here he is. Try to get help from the baby's father. If you remember who he is. Mom, don't cry! Adele, thank you for coming. Sorry if I disturbed you at this hour. -What happened? -I'm leaving tomorrow. -I don't want to stay in this house. -Why? Why? Because they forced me to sell it. I got almost nothing out of it. Debts, mortgages… But that doesn't matter. Here, Adele, in this box I have everything I have left. My most cherished memories, my only wealth. I entrust this to you, I will have it brought to your home. -Please, you keep it. -Where do you want to go? I don't know yet. Away from here, where no one knows of my misfortunes, -of my shame. -What about the child? I'll take him with me, I am not scared. I'm strong enough to work. You don't want to come back here? I don't know, maybe someday, when everyone forgot about me. -Are you Maria Dermoz? -Yes. -The department head wants you. -Thank you. Who would have thought, she's even been in jail. You wanted to see me? Tell me. Why didn't you tell me that you had been in prison? -I didn't think… -We don't want convicted people. I got a reprimand for hiring you. You are a beautiful girl, to live you wouldn't need to work. Goodbye. I've tried every way, but when they find out I've been in jail, -all the doors close. -Prejudices of people. I understand. But it is necessary for me to live, to feed this poor creature. Leave him here, we'll take care of him. Your intentions were generous, but you would unfortunately end up to do his and your damage. But I don't want to abandon him. I swore it on the grave of my mother and my sister. I don't want him to grow up as nobody's child. You have already done a lot and much you can still do. We will make him study and give him an education. That's what I recommend, mother. I will work and everything I earn will be for him. It is now the only purpose of my life. Don't worry about him, God be with you. -Nino, can you give me the package? -No. Dear, come. Let's go. -Who's there, Mary? -Mrs. Laura. Stefano, what an unexpected surprise after so long! Yes, almost 12 years. Yet to see these places and seeing you again, it seems to return to those distant times. -Do you still remember me? -I've never forgotten you. Please, come in. -When did you arrive? -Today. I'm leaving tomorrow. -Please. -Thank you. -Are you going back to Italy? -Yes. -Forever? -I don't know, maybe. -And you don't wish to return? -My life is here now. Nobody is waiting for me there. What about you? No, no one. And of that woman you haven't heard anything more? -Nothing. -But you still think about her. Yes, I still think about her. I can't get her out of my mind and my heart, it's like an obsession. -And maybe you'll look for her. -Of course I'll look for her. I want to know what she does, how she lives, who she lives with. Why do you want to torment yourself? And you think I haven't suffered all this time? I have lived a life full of risks and labors to forget her, but I didn't make it. Now I'm rich, but what do I need this money for? Nothing. I would give everything I have to go back to be what I was then. An emigrant in search of work, a poor man with no resources, but with a great happiness in his heart. With immense wealth, the love of a woman. Excuse me for letting myself dragged into talking about me, of things you don't care about. Oh, no, you are wrong, they interest me very much. Do you remember? There was a moment I was hoping… that you could forget that woman. -But maybe you don't remember. -No, madam, I remember. But everyone is tied to his destiny like a chain and my destiny is still called Maria. I made these shirts and socks when I had time. About money, that's all I could get. I can't find a job. No, keep it, this money must be for you. It doesn't matter to me, I want the boy to have all that -he needs to study. -No worries, he won't miss anything. He's smart, intelligent, always asks me about you, about his mom. -His mom. -You really deserve that name. You've done for him more than any mother would have done for her son. Mom! Come here, let me see you. -You look good! -I haven't seen you in a long time. You're right, I've always been busy. But I promise I'll come to see you much more often. Are you happy? No, I want to come with you. Why? Are you not comfortable here? Maybe they treat you badly? -No, but… -Speak up, is something wrong? -You have to tell me everything. -My schoolmates. -Well? -Mom, who was my father? -Why are you asking me this? -Tell me, who was he? I told you, a good man, a worker. He's dead. Then why my last name is Dermoz like you? Why I don't have his last name? -His name was Dermoz as well. -He isn't unknown then. -But who told you this? -At school, some classmates. But they'll see! Don't say such things. Let them say what they want, they don't know. Mom! What's wrong with you, mom? Nothing, it'll pass. Will I spend the holidays with you? Yes, rest assured, you'll come and stay with me. Ah, you're here. I didn't think I'd see you again. I never wanted to go back here, but unfortunately I can't do any different. -But you're mourning. -Yes. My grandson… Dario. You need me, don't you? You did well to come, but why didn't you accept my help? What? In what can I… For me nothing, but for the child only. You must have known that I took him, I gave him a name. I've heard it all. I had him study, he doesn't know anything about that story. He thinks I'm his mom and he loves me as if I were. I have worked for him, I have borne the heaviest labors, but now I can no longer continue. I'm exhausted, sick, I can't take it anymore. I can tell, you look like you're in pain. -I'll take care of you. -No, countess. I'll tell you again, I didn't come for me, but only for the boy. -What can I do for him? -Don't abandon him, countess. I have done what I can, but my strength is lacking. That poor creature must not suffer for the sins of others. It is not a right that I have come to claim. Nor to remind you of a duty, believe me. I only ask for pity for that poor innocent, who, when he loses me, will be left alone in the world. Where is the child now? At the St. Vincent college. Soon will be the end of the school year. I was supposed to pick him up. Tell him I left, I don't want him to see me like this. Tell him I'm fine. Yes. But where are we? Whose house is this? I want to go to Mom's. Why don't you answer? -Where is mom? -I don't know anything. Good morning, Countess. We have arrived just now. He has done nothing but ask about his mother. How you look like him! -Good morning. -Good morning. -Did you have a good trip? -Yes. -How old are you? -Eleven. -What is your name? -Antonio Dermoz. Where is my mom? She had to leave, she entrusted you to me. You'll stay here and I'll take care of everything. -But who are you? -It doesn't matter. I too, like you, am alone. I had a grandson, he was everything to me. He died, far away. Far away, in Buenos Aires. A car. He loved them. A car took him away. And left me alone. At my age it's sad to be alone. Stay with me. If you stay with me, it will seem to me to have Dario, next to me. But when will mom come back? I will try to be for you like a mother. Would you want this? But you can't leave. You have a fever, you can't stand up. Stay here for some time. No, I can't. I have to go back to work, otherwise I'll lose my job. But how can you think about work in these conditions? Stay here. You will help me, I will find you a job. No, never here. There are too many sad memories, too many people who know me. Stay calm now. -Has Maria left? -No, madam. -He's asleep. -She's in Adele Dormaz's house. She is very sick. Come. -Are you Mrs. Adele? -Yes, but who are you? -Is my mother here? -Maria? She's over there. -Wait! -Mother! Mom! I'm right here, Mom. -Can I help you? -Good morning. -Good morning. -I would like some information. If I may. You are the gentleman who arrived from America, right? -Yes, from Canada. How do you know? -Here we know everything right away. And a new face intrigues. Tell me. I would like to know where did the people who lived here end up. -They had this store. -I don't know. They told me that there were two sisters and that one died. Lisetta, I think, the youngest. And the other one ended up in jail. That's all I know, I'm not from here. Yeah. -What do you want? -I'd like to sell this. -But we sell, we don't buy. -Any other news for me? -I'm sorry. -Thank you. There is also a magnificent wedding dress. -Whose is it? -My mother's. -And why is she selling it? -She doesn't know about it. My mother is sick and we need money for medicine. -Do you buy it for me? -What should I do with it? Look, it's also broken. Look, just bring this stuff home. But I need money for medicine. -How much? -I've just been to the pharmacist. -He wants 6,000 lira. -Don't worry about it. I'll buy the medicine for you, take the dress back to your mom. -But why? -Me too when I was a boy like you I used to sell the stuff from home to take care of my mother. Come on. -Good morning. -Good morning. -So, did you find him? -Yes. He escaped from here to go to Adele's house. He must come back, Maria gave him to me because she couldn't keep him. Do you want me to get him back? No, I'll go. Where is this Adele's house? At the end of the village, the last house to the right. -Mom, here's the medicine. -How did you pay for them? -Take them, don't talk. -How did you pay for them? -A gentleman gave me the money. -What are you talking about? There he is. This is the gentleman who bought the medicine. My mom. I'm going to go make your drops. -Why did you come? -And you ask me? All these years I've been waiting for the moment I'd seen you again. I wouldn't have wanted to, but I have the courage to confess it to you. This desire has always been stronger than me and just as I returned to the village, I asked everyone. Nobody could tell me anything or maybe nobody wanted to tell me anything. Then, when I was about to leave, I met up with him. Chance, fate, I don't know. But I couldn't imagine that it was you, and your son. I felt sorry for that kid and so did you. You're in bad shape, huh? Tell me what I can do for you. What do you want from me? Do you want to see my misery? Here, look at me! Now you know how bad I am, but I don't want your pity! You wouldn't believe me, you preferred to get rid of me! And what do you want now? Go away! Go away! I don't want anything from you anymore! Go away! Yes. Maybe you're right. Goodbye. Why do you want to stay here? Come with me. You will be happy, come. -No, I want to stay with mom. -Listen to me, son. You are old enough to know the truth. Maria is not your mother, your mother is dead. She was Maria's sister. She died giving birth to you. -As you see, you can come with me. -No, it's not true. -It's the truth, I'll prove it to you. -It's not true. -It's not true! -Nino… It's not true. I am Maria's husband. I want to know the truth, speak up. -Stefano. -Yes. Go ahead, talk. Is it true what you said to the boy? Yes, it is true, Maria is innocent. Nino is the son of Lisetta and Dario. I'm the guilty one. Remorse is killing me! My God, have mercy! Tell me it's not true, tell me that you are my mother. Yes, I am. She scared me, that ugly witch. I am your mother. I finally learned the truth. But why didn't you write to me? Why didn't you let me know? -Go away. -Maria, I love you. I have always loved you, you're the only woman of my life. But how did I ever doubt you, your love? Because you still love me, don't you? Tell me that you forgive me. Tell me you believe my words. My life won't be enough to repay you for the evil you have suffered. Maria, my love. Mom, is that my dad? Yes, Nino, he's your dad. THE END Subtitles edited by: Silvia Gallico
