(street noise) (metal detector beeps) (indistinct radio chatter) (indistinct) - Good morning, guys. - Woman: Good morning. Good. Go directly to you by the seventh (indistinct), and then we are out of there. Uh, what have they called so far? Sharon. Reporter (TV): Right now we have a major projection, major projection to make in the state of Maryland... (cell phone rings) ...we project will be elected, the next United States senator from the state of Maryland, succeeding Paul Sarbanes... - Alright, that's good. - Did you call them? No, I'm gonna make calls now. Do they have a count on the House seats yet? (both speaking indistinctly) That's the only one that's a pick-up, though Yarmuth in Louisville is up with... - That's what I'm talking about. - 96% in, but they haven't called it. My goal is every candidate... Every candidate I campaign for, I want to win. - (laughs) - Every single one. Hey, congratulations, Madam Speaker. We... Well, listen, we're... We're so proud of you. You're... You're making history, and, uh, let's figure out how I can be helpful going forward. Alright. Bye-bye. Woman: We keep asking you, are you ready to run? Are you ready to serve as President? Barack Obama: You know, the, uh... I haven't had time to catch my breath. This, I think, will be the first week where I haven't taken off my shoes at the airport security terminal. So, I'm gonna step back, take a look at what's going on, and, you know, really do some soul-searching in terms of how I can be most useful to the country. I haven't had time to do that yet. ...this point with 84 and a half in. -(sigh) You don't get a lot tighter than that. - Nope. I love elections. It's so much fun. (laughs) It's even more fun when you're not on the ballot. (traffic ambiance) (indistinct chatter) -(indistinct) -Ronnie Cho: My name is Ronnie, calling from the Barack Obama campaign here in Des Moines. And just wanted to try to get acquainted with people in the community. I'm gonna be working in that area through the caucuses in January. Oh, you do a caucus? Well, that's great. Have you decided who you'll be supporting? Not yet. Well, you're right. It is awfully early. Well, Alvin, is there a particular issue that you care about? Something that stands out in your mind? Just basically just trying to get out there, set up meetings with activists, let them know that we're here and we'd like to talk to them. You know, people wanna see him, but they don't necessarily know a lot about him. -He is the biggest and best tool we have -(jet idling) in terms of drawing people in to get interested. I think that's half the battle. - How are you? Having fun? - What's going on? It's been a couple of crazy days, huh? - I like this. - You like it? - Yeah, I do. - Okay, good. Linda, I can't wait to see you on the 30th, and let's just... Let's just stay in touch. Say hi to... Say hi to your husband and son for me. Alright, bye-bye. (hangs up) - (indistinct) - I'm the one... Sorry, after this next... - these next two calls, - Robert Gibbs: Yes, sir. Are we going straight to the farm thing? Gibbs: Yes. We'll do the remaining press calls in the car. Obama: I just want a second to change out of... This is not the best outfit for... - Gibbs: I hear you. - Rural America. Paul Tewes: We got overalls. - I'm not gonna wear overalls. - And a horse. - Is that gonna be a problem? - (laughs) A horse I won't mind, actually. That sounds kinda cool. Obama: So I just want to check in and find out what we need to do to earn your support, because I think once I get you, that puts us over the top. Then I've got... I've got Iowa at that point. I, you know, I... I understand completely, but, you know, the one thing I will say is that... we wanna make sure that anybody who is supporting us, that, you know, this is all part of a single team. I'm fascinated by Obama. Here's a man who's been in town... Washington for two... Two years? As near as I can tell, hasn't done a thing? Apparently there's no performance criteria, in the process of selecting somebody to be President. Nobody asked the question what has he, in fact, ever done? Woman: What do you think of Barack Obama? I think he's a cool guy. I don't know much about the guy to be honest with you. I have no clue who that is. - Man: You don't? Okay. - I have no clue who that is. Girl: Wait, is he African American? - Yeah. - Okay. That'd be really cool if he was our next President then. I got a "O," you got a "Bama." - O! O! - All: Bama! Bama! I got a "O," you got a "Bama." - O! O! - All: Bama! Bama! Mike Blake: I got a "O," you got a "Bama." - O! O! O! O! - All: Bama! Bama! Bama! Bama! I haven't done this since, um, I campaigned for Bobby Kennedy back in mid '60s, '68. There just hasn't been anybody that's been exciting enough. Crowd (chanting): I, O, W, A, Barack Obama all the way. I, O, W, A, Barack Obama all the way. I, O, W, A, Barack Obama all the way! Woman: Do you think this country is ready to elect the first African American President? - No. No. - Man: Sure. Not even Colin Powell? He would get elected. That's a different story. He's smart enough to know not to run. Woman 1: Right now I have to say that I'm... I'm looking at Edwards. I would like to see Richardson. Woman 2: I don't like any of the candidates. I don't think any of them are the right people. I think Hillary's been around too long. She doesn't stand for anything anymore. Obama's wonderful but he's just a little too young and untried. 'Course after Bush, anybody can be President. I can be President. It's for good reason, if you think about it the odds of me standing here are very slim. I wasn't born to money, I wasn't born to fame, I didn't have a famous family member. You know, my father left when I was two years old. I was raised by a single mom and by my grandparents. And so they... They gave me love, and they gave me an education, and they gave me hope. David Axelrod: I met Barack Obama in 1992. He was an extraordinary guy. He was thoughtful, he was funny -(crowd cheering) -and he was obviously well-motivated. In 2002, -(crowd cheering) -I heard that he was considering a race in 2004 for the Senate, and I'd thought, like, if you could elect Barack Obama to the United States Senate that you'd be doing something that you could be proud of for the rest of your life. She was the manager for my first campaign. Yes, I was. Carol Harwell, from the west side of Chicago. - Right on. - (both laugh) If it wasn't for her, I'd be nowhere. Thank you. (laugh) Over the course of time, and particularly in the spring of 2006, leading into the summer, -(applause, cheering) -everywhere he went, he was drawing huge crowds. And at each event people would say, "You really ought to think about running for President." Barack asked us a lot of questions, and we said, "Why would you wanna run for President of the United States?" -(indistinct) -And he said, "I have a strong feeling about "what it would mean to a lot of young kids around this country "the moment I raise my hand and swore that oath because all of a sudden, anything would be possible." Appreciate you taking the time to come out, even though it's a little hot. - You gonna shake his hand? - I know. But you know, my... my daughter... How old are you, nine? Yeah, my daughter is nine. She explained me, "Dad, you know, kids don't shake hands. - (chuckle) - They just say 'Hey'." I think I'm gonna win again. That's my prediction. You just... Alright, Sasha. (laughs) Sasha! I did nothing! - You just ruin everything. - (laughing) (yelling) Malia Obama: That was perfect. (indistinct) (phone ringing) I'll... I'll get it. If it's Kathy, tell her she can stay as long as she wants. Malia: Hello? Hi, Daddy. - Oh, it's Daddy. - Dada. I'm fine. Daddy, I had to eat a lot of chocolate today. (laugh) Yup. Okay. I love you. Okay. Hi, Daddy. Good. Yes, I went to the gym. (indistinct chatter, laughing) Uh, I played with Poi ball. - (indistinct chatter) - Poi ball. You wanna talk to Mama? Okay. Mommy. Alright, I play, Malia play, you play. Hello. Michelle Obama: I had, you know, a lot of practical questions that I needed answers to before I could say definitely that this is something that I could handle. Which I was telling Lindsay about... Michelle: That is funny how they do the... How is this gonna work? What would be the schedule? How often would Barack be on the road? What would be expected of me as a campaigner - (laughter) - and spokesperson? Now I'm really not tired. A little ice cream boost. - (indistinct chatter) - You wanna hold on to this? - Can I have a lick? - You can. Yeah, that's your second. - Staffer: Go ahead, finish it. - Malia, can I have a lick? - Malia, can I have a lick? - Michelle: And how would we structure our time to ensure that our girls would not be pulled out of their lives? How much would it cost us as a family? How are we financially going to handle me reducing my hours at work to be able to participate? What would the campaign do, if anything, about security? We obviously got all the... Those questions answered to my satisfaction, and, as a result, we are now running for President. (laughs) (park chatter) - Woman: What are you gonna be when you grow up? - Ah... I wanna be an actress. Woman: How do you feel about your dad running for President? What's it been like? - (indistinct chatter) - It's hot. - Hi, how are you? - Tommy Vietor: This is actually taped. -This is actually taped. -It's taped. It was supposed to be live, - and then our sat truck went down, of course. - No problem. - Woman: How'd this event go? - (train horn) It's great. Except for the, you know, seven trains that went by and the bug that he ate. Other than that... Vietor: I'll never forget the first time I met Barack. I was in this office, and we were working on the weekend, and he walks in. I sort of pop up and then I shake his hand. He was great. I mean, I didn't spent a lot of time with him until they got to the Senate. I always sort of felt like there wasn't a day where I didn't feel like he was uniquely qualified to do anything. You know, be a Senator, be a CEO, lead the country. And that's what's so impressive about the guy. (indistinct chatter) - Okay, hey, guys. - How are you? - This is my Polk County staff? - Man: Yeah, some of them. - Obama: Good-looking group. - (laughs) (indistinct) Alright. Are any of these people over 30? (laughs) Nope. (indistinct chatter) David Plouffe: You're part of something really historic today. We've got 10, 15,000 people around the country, right now as we speak, knocking doors and attending events and spreading the message about the campaign. What this really speaks to is the kind of grassroots enthusiasm that Barack Obama's candidacy is inspiring all across the country. He's a community organizer at heart. So door-to-door canvassing, phone calls, real contact with voters. Even in a Presidential campaign, his firm belief is that to both succeed electorally and transform the country and make the changes we need to, we need to build a grassroots movement for change. - Woman: Where are you gonna walk? - Just here in Illinois. Woman: Can we follow you? Uh, well I've got to wait for my son to wake up, so this is kind of our own freelance canvas. Barack is walking in about 20 minutes. -Thanks for coming out. Hey, everybody. -(indistinct) -(baby screeching) -I just wanted to say thank you so much for coming. You know, this isn't a bad day to be outside. I just want to let all of you know, I wanna shake hands with everybody. Hi, very nice to meet you. -Welcome to Iowa. -Hey, good to see you. How are you? Axelrod: Running for President is like being an astronaut. You can go in the simulator all you want, but until you're orbiting in space, you don't really know what it's gonna be like. I've been shaking hands... for three straight hours. (indistinct chatter) Straight. You guys are killing me! - I'm physically spent. - (laughing) I don't know how I'm going to give a speech! It's like I've been through a wrestling match! - Marvin! - Marvin Nicholson: Yes, sir. - You all are killing me, man. - Nicholson: What's the matter? I've been shaking hands three hours straight! - Nicholson: We're early, though. - Obama: We're early. - Nicholson: We're early, though. - (laughter) You got a lot more hands to shake in this state. - Man: Good morning again. - Obama: Good to see you. Okay, so I wanna emphasize that. I'm gonna talk about CAFE, I'm gonna talk about cap and trade, low-carbon standard. The equivalent of removing... Now, you know, there was a statistic, I don't know if you guys still have it, that if you're making the fuel less harmful and then you're also making the cars use less fuel, and, in combination, then it ends up being real powerful. Woman (PA): ...begin to engage in this whole support process. The whole country is watching us. (yawns) We came here to listen. This man came here to talk to you. He came here to listen to you. This is our place. This is his time. Mr. Senator Barack Obama. (crowd cheers) Axelrod: And there really isn't any corollary for what he's gone through because almost every candidate for President, save a very few, start off in semi-obscurity, and then work their way up. I always say, you know, most of them get to try their stuff out in New Haven and Topeka before they get to Broadway. We opened up right on Broadway. Critics in the front row. And that's an awful lot of pressure. The reality is, Obama is not gonna be the nominee for the simple fact that he's never run a competitive race outside a state-legislative district in Illinois, That is not gonna happen. He can't win the election. Woman: Why not? I don't think that America's ready for it yet. Just because of his race and his views. People are saying they're viewing him kinda as, like, a terrorist. They associate him with the terrorists and stuff, so, it's... I don't know. I think he'll have a tough time winning just because of that whole association-by-race. I find it kinda interesting. Everybody keeps asking me, "Well, you think that Obama got a leg up because he's African American?" My question is, well, does Clinton have a leg up because she's a woman? I'm actually going to wear a button for Hillary this time. And then my husband won't commit himself, but if he doesn't vote for her... We've been married 41 years. If he doesn't vote for her, we're through. We got to put up a fight against Hillary. We've had about 20 years of the Bushes and Hillarys. We want a fresh start, fresh face. That's Barack Obama. Is Hillary Clinton pulling away for the Democratic nomination? A new USA Today Gallup Poll gives her a double-digit lead right now over Barack Obama. Is she the inevitable nominee? Has Hillary Clinton got this thing locked? (amusement park screaming) (sizzling) Woman: Good job, Hillary. Good job. (laughter) Well, you know, if you can't stand the heat, - get out of the kitchen. - (all laughing) (alarm buzzes) (crowd cheers) Woman (PA): Finally. Alright. You get to pick out any prize you like. You want an update? I'm trying to get him on TV. On a local NBC affiliate, Live at 6, but I have no clue where we're gonna be, where we are and how long it's taking to get there. We're literally on our way out. (kids laughing) - Hey, I'm Tommy. - Oh, hey, Tommy. Tommy Vietor? - Yeah. - Scott Helman from the Boston Globe. - Hey, man! - How are you? I've been reading you forever. I've been swearing about Boston sports. Way to stick it to us on that crap lobbying story. Yeah, I knew you wouldn't like that. That's such bullshit. When are we gonna move past the gotcha story? Oh, come on, that was totally not bullshit... Here's the reason it's a bullshit story... Sir, we did two. Is that okay? - Woman 1: Alright. - Woman 2: Oh, look at that. - Which one is it? - Yeah, you did it, I think. - Woman 3: Yeah, you got it. - Man: Oh, I got it! Hey, thank you! Will you sign her thing? (indistinct chatter) I got a picture of you and Hillary. Yesterday was Dave's birthday. - Yeah, you told me. - Okay, just want to make sure. Dave, we're here. Dave Price: Alright, we're with Senator Barack Obama outside our Cast Your Kernel poll here. Senator, if you would like the honor here of actually voting. There's your corn kernel. (whistling) Price: Now, as you may see here, sir, - you're getting out-jarred now. - Obama: Excuse me, everybody. I need everybody to get a corn kernel and start filling up a jar. You don't want me to be behind. It's heartbreaking. So, we need to catch up. By Sunday, we're gonna have overtaken all the other candidates when it comes to their corn kernels, - alright? Do I have a commitment? - Man: Yeah. -(applause) -Obama: That's it. Thank you, guys. Hello, is this Barbara? My name's Lorenzo, and I'm nine years old. I'm a volunteer with the Obama campaign. How are you? - Where's Diana? - (office chatter) Who's Diana? Obama is the candidate running for President. No, not... Not Diana. Obama. Well, he is a candidate running for President. (sighs) He's a candidate running for President. Of the United States of America. No, Hillary is running for President. Obam... Hope you have a wonderful day. How are you, sir? - What's your name? - Joe Scott. Good to see you, Joe. How you been? Is this your shop? - No. - Oh. (laugh) Hi, Barack. What's your name? - John. - Nice to meet you, John. - Sarah. - Hey, Sarah, good to see you. - Kay. - Hey, Kay. - Rose. - Nice to meet you. - You too. - Well, thank you very much for saying hello. This is... This is as nice a downtown as I've seen. Obama has raised more money... A little bit more money than Hillary. Yet... if you look at the national polls, his momentum just stalled at a certain point this summer. People are starting to question whether he has what it takes to take down Hillary. - Congratulations. - Thank you. So the question everyone has been waiting to have answered in this campaign is when is Obama gonna start moving in these national polls? Reporter: Senator Hillary Clinton's widening her lead -with a 30-point lead. I had to ask, I have to ask. -(scoff) - (laugh) - Does it concern you at all? - I mean... - (laugh) We're having a good time in Iowa. You know, the national polls story will run... Sooner or later, it has to run itself out. At some point, there'll be the first actual vote. Lynn Sweet: I think these polls can change. I think he's not in the best position to win, but, by no means is he not in a position to win. The strength of Obama's calling card is he's a community organizer. This campaign is his laboratory for organizing. - ♪ You better think ♪ - ♪ Think ♪ ♪ Think about what you're tryin' to do to me ♪ - ♪ Think ♪ - ♪ Think, think ♪ ♪ Let your mind go, let yourself be free ♪ ♪ Let's go back, let's go back ♪ ♪ Let's go way on to way back when ♪ ♪ I didn't even know you ♪ ♪ You couldn't have been too much more than 10 ♪ ♪ I ain't no psychiatrist ♪ ♪ I ain't no doctor with degrees ♪ ♪ But it don't take too much high IQ's ♪ ♪ To see what you're doin' to me ♪ - ♪ You better think ♪ - ♪ Think ♪ ♪ Think about what you're tryin' to do to me ♪ - ♪ Yeah, think ♪ - ♪ Think, think ♪ ♪ Let your mind go, let yourself be free ♪ - ♪ Oh, freedom ♪ - ♪ Freedom ♪ - ♪ Freedom ♪ - ♪ Freedom ♪ ♪ Oh, freedom ♪ - ♪ Yeah, freedom ♪ - ♪ Freedom ♪ - ♪ Oh, now, freedom ♪ - ♪ Freedom ♪ - ♪ Oh, freedom ♪ - ♪ Freedom ♪ He's got my vote.

(laugh) - Oh, yeah. Axelrod: Jon is, in my view, a brilliant young guy. Woman: Is he a hero of yours? Jon Favreau: Yeah, he's one of them for sure. I mean, you know, cliché but as a speech writer, you always look to Kennedy for sure. I think for speeches, even Bobby Kennedy's speeches are probably even more inspirational in some senses. It's a little more like Barack, I think. Axelrod: I think he has a good ear for Barack's voice. It's a very tough thing to be a speech writer for Barack, because Barack is the best speech writer in our group. Now, you guys may argue with me with on this, but, again, I'm just trying to give a little bit of a... I want this to be populist, but I want a little bit of a flavor. Forward-looking. So, one place we can put it. "I will eliminate capital gains tax for small businesses to start up their engine of growth." Favreau: He always wrote most of his speeches himself before this. He's had to get used to having... writers around, just because the nature of a Presidential campaign. But he doesn't give up, you know... He's still the chief speech writer, always. (indistinct) We are 77, 8, something like that, days out from the Iowa caucus. I am working on the speech he'll give at the Jefferson-Jackson dinner in Iowa, which is a pretty big deal, where all the candidates are gonna appear at the same time. It's a big organizational test of each campaign, see who can turn out the most people, the most raucous crowd, give a great speech. (drumline playing) We think of the 9000 people going to J-J tonight, 3,000... We know 3,000 are our votes. 3,000 or more. As you can see. (drums playing, crowd cheering) (drumming, cheering continue) (crowd chanting) (cheering continues) (laugh) People ask me, "Why do you think you can win Iowa?" And I think if we're in a close race, these kids, they're gonna win it for us. Thank you, guys. Axelrod: They think they're changing the world and that's the best thing that they could do, and God bless them. We need more of them. - The good news is I think they are. - Yeah. (cheering continues) Obama: I am running in this race, because of what Dr. King called, "The fierce urgency of now." I believe the American people are tired of fear - and tired of distractions - (cheering) and tired of diversions. We can make this election not about fear, but about the future, and that won't just be a Democratic victory, that will be an American victory! (cheering, applauding) That's why I'm running, Democrats! Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. (music playing over loudspeakers) Obama: Thank you. ("Signed, Sealed, Delivered" by Stevie Wonder playing on speakers) Axelrod: The J.J. was a big task. Nine thousand people, and the whole political world focused on you. Your opponent's sitting in front of you. No teleprompter, no notes. Just you and this crowd. And he just knocked it out of the park. And I think the campaign changed dramatically that day. She's so real, I'm here to tell you. (indistinct chatter) Obama: I just want to say to the parents, thank you for doing a great job. I want to say to the organizers, don't believe everything I'm saying right now because I'm talking to your parents. - (laughter) - You better be working hard over these last two months. - (cheering) - We've got a lot of work to do! We gotta go get some caucus-goers! We gotta knock on doors! We gotta make phone calls! We gotta get everybody in Iowa fired up! I'm ready to go! (truck rumbling) (chatter) I'm finding supporters out of the woodworks. My neighbors down the street I had no idea about are supporting Obama. You can tell that, you know, the momentum has definitely shifted. I remember there were times when people couldn't even pronounce "Barack Obama," much less end up caucusing for him, so he's come a long way. We can start here. This is Stephanie Grobman. - Stephanie Grobman: Hey. - What happened? I had to pick up Senator Wofford from the airport. Oh, that's so nice of you. - Was he nice? - Yeah, he was. Obama: You know, I think that we are at this moment that doesn't come around that often, where we've got a chance to make big change. After seven years of disastrous foreign policy and a country that is more divided and less competitive than it was before. I think, not only Democrats, but Republicans and Independents are looking for something new. Reporter: Anything keeping you up at night at this point? Uh, nothing keeps me up at night. - Reporter: It must be exhausting. - Yeah, it's tiring. Now, actually, one thing that keeps me up at night is the prospect of... dealing with all the problems that we've got right now. So, when I fret, it's not about the campaign. It's about governing and figuring out how can we lead this country to a better direction? Reporter: Do you have time to reflect on what, you know, what's happening to you? No. At some point I will. - Alright. - (indistinct) Candy Crowley: He seems different now. I sensed before that this civil rights professor, walked in and gave very deliberative answers, all of which is laudable. He thinks things through, but in sound-bite world, he was terrible. Well, now, that Barack Obama that flashed onto the national scene is showing up in Waterloo. His trajectory is good at this point. Now, can he bring it home? That's the beauty of Iowa. Nobody knows. Plouffe (phone): Alright, everybody. Thanks for getting on the phone. 12 months ago today, Barack was in Hawaii wrestling whether to run, on Christmas Eve. We had no infrastructure. If ever there was a David vs. Goliath situation, if Barack were to run, this is it. Barack came back from Hawaii and told us he was gonna run for the Presidency, and this improbable journey began. We were facing the most dominant national front-runner our party has seen in a generation, if not more. I talked to Barack when he landed after having been out in Iowa with you guys on that bus tour. And he said, "You know, I really wanna win this." I said, "Yeah, no shit, Sherlock." (laughter) And he said, "No, I really wanna win Iowa." I said, "Yeah, you know, if we win Iowa, I think we're off to the races. "He said," No, no. It's not about anything like that." He says, "I wanna win for those kids." Yeah, and... (voice breaking): He believes so strongly in what you guys are doing. In eight days, we're gonna win the Iowa caucus, in 13 days, we're gonna win the New Hampshire primary. In 24 days, the Nevada caucus, 31 days, the South Carolina primary. In 39 days, on February 5th, we're gonna clinch this nomination. Then we'll have to deal with Mitt or Rudy or Huckabee or whatever asshole they nominate. And November 4th, you all in this zone are gonna be responsible for electing Barack Obama, the 44th President of the United States. (applause) - Michelle: How's it going? - Woman: It's going very well. Alright, well, we need your support too. - Yeah. (laugh) - Are you both undecided? - We're undecided. - Oh, goodness. - But all of our family's... - You gotta work on 'em. We need your support. - I-I-I haven't decided yet. - (mocks stuttering) - I haven't decided yet. - Were you listening to me? - Yeah. - Were you awake? - ...Republican. - Were you awake? - Yeah. - You know you love me. (laughter) - Hi. - ...caucus for Obama! - Uh, uh... - Say, "Yes, I am." - Will you sign this? - I will. He says that if Barack Obama gets nominated, we won't have to worry about living on peanuts. That's right. That is absolutely right. Richard Wolffe: It's New Year's Eve and everyone's on tenterhooks waiting for the Des Moines register poll, which is... the serious poll of what's gonna happen. And the caucus is just a few days away. (indistinct chatter) Man: Oh shit, it's up! What... Uh, what is it? - Woman: Oh... - Man: Obama at 32. Clinton, 25. Edwards, 24. (cheering) Woo! That's wonderful. 32 to 25. That's gonna do it. Alright. Love you too, Mom. Bye. Yeah. Seven points, baby. I asked for a seven-point lead today. Who knew? (laughter) All (chanting): Fired up, ready to go! Fired up, ready to go! Fired up, ready to go! Fired up, ready to go! (all cheering) Listen, listen. I really want everybody to know this. Polls don't mean shit. And if you think tonight that this is done, you're wrong. This is a close, close, close race. And we are on the verge of making history. On the verge. And what we do tomorrow, and what we do the next day and what we do the day after that determines whether we're gonna make history or not. (indistinct chatter) Obama: Michelle and I had a really interesting conversation and she said, "We're not doing this again." (laughter) At first I thought she just meant well, you know what? I'm never home and it's hard on the family. And she meant a little bit of that, but what she really meant was, you know, that the reason that it was important for us to do this now, the reason it's better for us to do it now than later, is we're still almost normal. Which I loved. It was a great line. I attribute it to you. It was a good one. And what she meant was, you know what, five years ago, six years ago... We had just finished paying off our student loans. Michelle: Three years ago. What are you...? -(laughter) -Well, it was actually five or six. We were still living in a condo. It was a little bit too small for the kids, a growing family. We still had credit card debt. We were trying to figure out how to save for college for the girls and to save for our retirement. I mean, the point is, is that we've gone through what people are going through right now relatively recently. We don't forget it. And so, when I go into the White House, I will be carrying your voices with me. What it comes down to is, who do you trust? And, you know, I think that if you trust me, then I think I'll...

(TV chatter) Wolf, I think the most important thing to remember about the Democratic caucuses is they're not an election. They are a caucus. They're more like a meeting, and people stand up and be counted. They actually walk up to their candidate's location. They usually put up a poster for each candidate, and in front of their neighbors, they decide who to vote for. And now, we come to the key rule. Any candidate who is 15 percent or more, gets to go on to the next round. It's called the viability threshold. And any candidate who is not, uh... Does not get 15 percent, they're out. ♪ ♪ Tewes: I always think that people should witness the Iowa caucuses firsthand, because I... I do believe it's true democracy in action.

(crying) What I was so pleased with was, not just the fact that we won all the raw numbers, but what it showed about the country. I think it's fair to say that there were some who were skeptical that young people would come out, that Independents and Republicans would be voting Democratic in the... Caucusing in the Democratic caucus. Man: Can you just describe that moment when it sort of sunk in that you and your family won the first... The first battle? Uh... We've felt good for the last two weeks... because we were so proud of what was happening on the ground. We were seeing the crowds, and so, regardless of how the numbers played out exactly, we were really confident about us having changed how politics operated in this caucus, and it makes me very optimistic about the country.

(indistinct) Konrad Ng: What's it like to have Barack Obama as your brother and my brother-in-law? Maya Soetoro-Ng: There are moments, of course, when you recognize that there's sacrifice involved, and like I said, he belongs to the world now and, you know, you have to sort of come to terms with that and to know that your conversations aren't necessarily going to be as long. He's awfully busy, and... and that you might not have him for two weeks at Christmastime and, you know, December, that sort of thing. But again, you realize, well, it's... it is worth it. Neil Abercrombie: His father had been spotted by AID folks in Kenya as someone with the kind of intellect, the kind of drive, the kind of energy that we were hoping to attract as students back in those days, in the late '50s, early '60s, to come to the United States. Barack's mother, almost the mirror opposite. She was sweet and kind, but very, very smart. But a much more placid personality. Still water ran deep with her. It's an interesting thing, because he is the embodiment of his mom, uh, in his demeanor, but his intellect, of course, is like his dad. I've always said that, "Barack, you'd always be that voice of reason." So, as a kid, he had that voice of reason. He wasn't one of those kids who just went with the flow because that's what you're supposed to do. And I do see that in him now as an adult. You know, and I think that's what appeals to so many people. Maya: This is where Barack grew up, with our grandparents. They lived on the 10th floor, and our grandmother still resides there. Titcomb: His grandparents, you called them grandparents, but they were his parents, you know, growing up here. He was just a very normal boy. He wanted to be a big-time basketball player. And he played basketball every minute that he could. He had a group of boys that would come over to this apartment and raid the refrigerator, and go play basketball and do things. I know this is hard on you, missing all of us, Maya and all the kids. Well, I love you, sweetie. Alright, bye-bye. Yeah. That was a good call.

Well, that hurts my feelings. - (laughter) - Moderator: I'm sorry, Senator. Hillary Clinton: But I'll try to go on.

Because one of the things that had plagued her was this sort of lack of authenticity and humanity, and here was this very human moment, and whether she was crying because she was losing or not, she was showing an emotion people could relate to. -Man: Mr. Obama! Come on, come on! -(chatter) - Are you nervous? - Obama: What's up? Man: There's more and more people... No, I'm not nervous, I feel great. We just wanna make sure everybody goes to the polls. We've only won one state. If we do well tonight, maybe two. Then there are 48 to go. Linda, Hillary Clinton woke up this primary morning, her Presidential aspirations potentially on the line, ready to work for every last vote. (crowd cheering) She traveled to five different polling sites in five hours trying to rally her supporters, hoping to turn the tide against her predicted by the polls. Ryan Lizza: The exit polls all day have gone from... The first wave was about nine points, the second wave about four or five points, and the final wave is about one point, Obama over Hillary, all three. And now, the returns that are coming in are showing her up by like five or six points. As soon as we started getting returns, Matt Rodriguez, our state coordinator, looked at some precincts from Manchester and he said, "How could this be?" You know, we're gonna lose. And CNN is now ready to project that Hillary Clinton has won the New Hampshire primary. Hillary Clinton will emerge the victor tonight. Axelrod: So, we went up to tell Barack that we weren't gonna win the New Hampshire primary, he having gone into his dinner with his wife, thinking that he was preparing for a victory. We were in a hotel room, and whenever... Gibbs and Axelrod come up with that kind of sheepish hangdog look, then you know that things aren't going the way they're supposed to. - (cheering) - I want especially to thank New Hampshire. Over the last week I listened to you, and in the process I found my own voice. (applause, cheering) He leaned against the wall and smiled kind of, uh, wanly, and said, "This thing's gonna go on for a while, isn't it?" Obama: When we've been told we're not ready, or that we shouldn't try, or that we can't, generations of Americans have responded with a simple creed that sums up the spirit of a people. "Yes, we can." - (crowd cheering) - Yes, we can. I didn't consider that a low point in the campaign. I actually thought that was a good moment in the campaign. It was whispered by slaves and abolitionists as they blazed the trail towards freedom through the darkest of nights, - "Yes, we can." - (cheering) It was the call of workers who organized, women who reached for the ballot, a President who chose the moon as our new frontier, and a King who took us to the mountaintop and pointed the way to the promised land. "Yes, we can" to justice and equality. (applause) We had come out of Iowa so energized, and, you know, everybody was giddy. And... you know, although I think we... believed that we were guarding against hubris, I'm not sure we were.

To the political reporters trapped on this plane, it's Super Tuesday, which means the Democrats are voting in 22 states, the Republicans are voting in 21 states. This is the biggest political day of the year. The biggest challenge of this Super Tuesday contest is just the breadth and expansion of it. There are contests in 22 states, 15 primaries, seven caucuses. Tonight, there are 1,681 delegates picked for the Democratic convention, which is more than half of the delegates you need to win the nomination. -This is the first week that Senator Obama -(applause) has caught up with her in national polls. Really, only a week ago, he was still 10 points down. For Senator Obama, this is probably the biggest week of his campaign. (office chatter) Woman: When do you think this is gonna be decided?

The wins in Ohio and Texas are oh so significant for Hillary Clinton in going forward. Let's take a look and recap. - (cheering) - You know that they say. As Ohio goes, so goes the nation. - (cheering) - No one says that. (laughter) Obama: (hangs up) We don't have a choice when it comes to our relatives. We have a choice when it comes to our pastors. Goddamn America! That's in the Bible! For killing innocent people! Goddamn America! How could you go to this church for 20 years, and not know this guy said this? There's no way Obama can shade it. "Well, you know, I sort of agree, but I..." You know, no. That's crazy. Bill O'Reilly: New polls say Barack Obama's taking a big hit because of his pastor, but there is a racial divide. I think it's a bunch of crap. It's been taken out of context. That Reverend Wright looks like a raving maniac to me. I don't think for one moment that Obama believes in those things. If I belonged to a church that had that much hate in it, I wouldn't belong there very long. I'm fearful that, uh, Obama feels the same way. Dr. King said many of the same things. If this is the best candidate that we have to put up for President of the United States, this country's in terrible trouble. Strictly, Obama's out. - (jet engines whirring) - (inaudible) Wolffe: Campaigns are fashioned in the image of their maker. And then, of course, the sort of main narrative of this campaign has been about his identity. We're not used to an African American politician talking, thinking, behaving like he is. And when a story like Reverend Wright pops up... There have been plenty of controversial preachers and pastors in American politics. Clearly, in this case, we're fascinated by Wright and about Obama because of race. Cho: You know, we're... sort of in a street fight for the nomination here. The events with Reverend Wright, and the attacks, and... You know, it makes it difficult to keep the tone of our message and to maintain the integrity of that. At one of our field offices, they just spray-painted slurs about Barack on the window. And the downtown office right here, somebody threw a barricade through the window, broke the windows. It... It sucks. Living in a world where the rules that you're living by and the rules that the campaign lives by aren't necessarily the rules the world lives by. Zeleny: This week, I think, has been the most trying week of the Senator's campaign, because he really had to deal with something personal. There were super delegates, there were other Democratic supporters calling, e-mailing members of his staff saying, "Look, this is killing you, you need to do something about this." This is an issue that will stay with him for the rest of the campaign, however long that is. (crowd cheering) (rumbling) If they come at us on this what's it gonna look like? Is it just gonna be "Goddamn America," or is it gonna be... you know, US. of KKK A? - If they use it, it's gonna be him condemning America. - Right, right. Axelrod: I think we all were a little unsettled by the Wright deal. It was coming at us with such ferocity. If Wright became a surrogate for Barack Obama, then, certainly, the race was over. What does it... If it's, like, just a total over-the-top... You know. So we have two versions of the Wright response. Axelrod: It was a troubling time, and no one had a great idea about how to deal with it. Except Barack, which was, "let's go right at it." (TV chatter) Barack called me up Friday night, I think he called Plouffe as well, and said "I want to give a speech on Wright, "but it has to be bigger than Wright. "I wanna talk about this whole issue of race relations in our country." And he said, "I don't know whether it's gonna help us or not, "but I think that it's a moment "in which we can confront this thing "in a way, this thing being the issue of race, in a way that could be really valuable." Man: Give me a sense of what you're anticipating from Barack Obama today. I don't know. It's clearly a very important speech. It's gonna be a defining speech for him. I hope he talks as much about patriotism and his feeling about the country as he does about race. Reverend Wright's comments were not only wrong, but divisive. Divisive at a time when we need unity. Racially charged at a time when we need to come together to solve a set of monumental problems. But I can no more disown him than I can disown my white grandmother, a woman who helped raise me, a woman who sacrificed again and again for me, a woman who loves me as much as she loves anything in this world, but a woman who once confessed her fear of black men who passed her by on the street. Favreau: You know, he felt good about it, because he knew what he wanted to say. He had known it for a long time, probably, and it had crystallized in his mind after the controversy erupted. And the way he is is that he's just confident enough, and, "Look-it. This is what I believe to be true. "This is what I think about this issue, "I'm gonna say it. If people buy it, "they buy it. If they don't, what can I do? "You know, I... I... I, you know, spoke as honestly as I could." Wolffe: Well, my first impression is, uh, just what a gutsy move it was to have the speech at all. Here you have, obviously, a candidate of a very different complexion in many ways really confronting this hot button, very emotional issue, head-on. Really, words can't describe how I felt to hear that speech. It was moving. It really was. - Woman: That was a great speech. - It was pretty good. - Woman: How'd it feel to give it? - Huh? - Woman: How'd it feel to give it? - Strong. (indistinct chatter) Plouffe: We are not terribly, uh, buffeted around by the conventional wisdom crowd, - (basketball chatter) - because the truth is, every day there's something written or said that is a challenge to Barack, challenges our campaign strategy, challenges our execution. And, you know, not that we're being arrogant. The truth is that sometimes feedback is very important, that you need to know. But for the most part, you know, you just gotta keep your eyes straight ahead, know where you're going, know what your strategy is to win. As I said, we don't have real... a lot of message angst, because Barack has a very clear sense of who he is and what he's saying. So, I'm not making a long speech. I just wanna come by and say hello to everybody. Thank you. (cheering) Wolffe: The race is important. Every twist and turn is important. But the shape of the race is what it is. He has a lead in pledged delegates that she's highly unlikely to overturn. So, this is all about an argument they're making for super delegates, these party insiders who are steadily trickling towards Obama. - Alright, fire away. - Woman: Senator, are you gonna wrap up the nomination tomorrow? Obama: We feel good about the number of super delegates that we've, uh, been accumulating, and my sense is is between Tuesday and Wednesday that we got a good chance of getting the number that we need to achieve the nomination, but, obviously, there are two more... ♪ ♪ Senator Barack Obama goes over the threshold, goes over 2118 delegates. He will be the Democratic Presidential nominee. Favreau: Final speech. - Woman: Really? - Favreau: Just emailed. Woman: What's the tone? - Tone is victorious. - Okay. You know, we won, thank you, thank you, other candidates, thank you, Hillary, you're great. McCain, blah, blah, blah, hope, change, you know. (indistinct chatter) So, listen, uh... Man: What's that? (TV chatter, cheering) In the end, while this primary was long, I am so proud we stayed the course together. (crowd cheering) Clinton (TV): It means that every single United States citizen had a chance to make his or her voice heard. Senator Obama has inspired so many Americans to care about politics, and empowered so many more to get involved. Hi, it's Robert Gibbs with Senator Obama. Hi, how are you? I am good. Senator Obama is wondering if Senator Clinton was available. - (indistinct) - Hello? Can you hear me? (indistinct chatter) Gibbs: Hi, Huma, it's Robert Gibbs again, Senator Obama's trying to reach Senator Clinton. Shh. (indistinct chatter) (chuckle) Hey, Huma, this is Barack. Uh, just calling Hillary to congratulate her on South Dakota. And, uh, I look forward to working with you guys soon. She can call us back anytime at 312-533... Hope you guys are doing well. Talk to you soon. Bye-bye. (indistinct chatter) (chatter continues) - Obama: Looks pretty good. - Nicholson: It sure does. (music playing) We filled it up, right? Gibbs: Barbara didn't tell you about overflow? -(TV cheering) -Dick Durbin (TV): Inspiring the dreams of a nation. Tonight, Barack Obama will accept our nomination, to be President of the United States of America. We still would've won if she hadn't... We'll go backstage and then how long we are backstage? Nicholson: About three minutes at the least. (TV continues) - (Obama speaking) - Yes. Good luck. (indistinct PA) Obama: When I was practicing the speech for the first time, and I came to the end where I talked about King speaking in the Lincoln Memorial, and... and I choked up and had to stop. I mean, Dr. King's speech happened when I was two years old. So, you know, anybody who's 60 or over, remembers it vividly. And, uh... And the majority of African Americans at that time couldn't vote much less run for President. - (indistinct speaker) - (crowd cheering) (cheering gets louder) (music rumbling over speakers) Thank you. To Chairman Dean, (cheering) and my great friend Dick Durbin, and to all my fellow citizens of this great nation, with profound gratitude and great humility, I accept your nomination for Presidency of the United States. (crowd cheering) (cheering continues) (fireworks exploding) Obama: Okay, everybody, now it's official. We couldn't have done it without you. Whoops. I'm sorry. Okay, let's try it again. Okay, now it's official. - I can't remember this... - (laughter) There's only two lines! Okay. -You're making me feel better. -(laughter) Okay, now it's official. - But this... Man, we couldn't... - (laughter) Hey, where is the teleprompter guy? Alright, come on, come on. Let's try it again. We're gonna do this. - Okay, this time we're gonna do it. - Alright. Hello, everybody. Woman: How will you avoid that you are going too negative? How will you balance it out into a positive? We wanna make sure that people understand my agenda. What I will do as President. I am confident that if the American people know what my plan for America is and what John McCain's plan for America is, then I will win this race. I don't spend a lot of time thinking about John McCain's negative ads. If I did, I wouldn't be spending much time thinking about other things, because they come fairly fast and frequently. My friends and fellow Americans. I am very pleased and very privileged to introduce to you the next Vice President - of the United States, - (cheering) Governor Sarah Palin of the great state of Alaska. (crowd cheering) (music blasting) Are you ready to shake things up in Washington? (crowd cheering) I think Sarah Palin has really helped to spark the Republican ticket, I really do. I don't think anybody, including the Democrats, saw this coming. She's a dangerous person, and I just would dread the thought that she's a heartbeat away from the Presidency. America's big. (laughter) Just traveling around Ohio, you realize how big this country is, and then when you go to all 48 states in the continental United States and you go to Hawaii, I have to say Alaska's the one state I haven't visited, -(laughter) -which, now that I think about it, I'm gonna have to... I'm gonna have to get up there. Man: Is there still an 18-state strategy or a 50-state strategy, or... Now that we're getting down to it, are some states coming off the map? Plouffe: We have a huge number of Bush states that McCain is defending. So, yes, the normal battlegrounds of Ohio and Missouri are very competitive. But there's new states. Virginia, Colorado, Indiana, North Carolina. We're playing offense in 11 or 12 states, including states that McCain never thought he'd have to defend, so if you look at the battleground states in the electoral college, we think McCain's in real trouble here, because he has to pull an inside straight at this point to win. ♪ ♪ Woman: Who is Barack Obama? I'm afraid this is someone who sees America as imperfect enough to work with a former domestic terrorist. Woman: Barack Obama and domestic terrorist Bill Ayers. Friends. How dangerous. On November 4th, let's leave Barack Hussein Obama wondering what happened... Obama's a terrorist, don't you know that? He wasn't born in America. I do not want a black man running my country. This is little Hussein. (laugh) Axelrod: I think it's getting very ugly out there. I mean, what McCain and Palin are doing is really irresponsible. I mean, they're inciting people. Don't believe for a second this election is over. Don't think for a minute that power will concede anything without a fight. We're gonna have to work like our future depends on it in these last few days, because it does. Since the convention, it's basically been like this. I mean, it's been a wild ride. We saw with John McCain that the Palin pick really gave him a bounce. But really, the game changer was the economy goes into this incredible meltdown. The fundamentals of our economy are strong, but these are very, very difficult times, and I promise you we will never put America in this position again. I know how tough it is right now in Nevada. But we've faced difficult times before. The American story has never been about things coming easy. It's been about rising at the moment when the moment was hard. Woman: This past week alone, we made over 450,000 phone calls, knocked on over 110,000 doors, but that's what it's gonna take. So as exhausted as we are, we were told a long time ago we wouldn't get to this point. Right? - Right? - All: Right. And, you know, a month... You know, it's... It's pretty surreal. Like, in four more weeks we finally get to the ultimate goal of winning, which we... we have to win. We have to win. (indistinct chatter) - Axelrod: Right. Here he is. - Anita Dunn: Here he is. - Obama: I'm here. - Dunn: Good morning. Hey! Good to see you, guys. Ron Klain: I think there are a few new things we want to work on. Medicare. What you want to say about McCain's announcement today... Plouffe: The debates are huge. McCain jettisoned his message. His message was all about experience. Now, he's given that up. So, he's saying the election's all about change. Well, so are we. We've been saying that for 20 months. So we think that's a debate we're well positioned to have because McCain isn't changing the economy. If you're not gonna change the economic policies that have failed the country, that's not change. You seem to feel the need to really answer every single McCain attack. I think our view is, you're at a stage in the race, you won two debates, your numbers are strong, where you can just push past him. You shouldn't feel vulnerable to every single thing the guy says. I mean, I think if he presses me on honesty, I mean, the, uh... I think there's nothing wrong with... The only thing is, I don't wanna sound whiny about his lies. Senator McCain keeps on talking about me being risky, but let me tell the American people what's risky. I think Senator McCain's plan for taxing your healthcare benefits, potentially leaving 20 million people without employer-based healthcare, I think that's risky. If this whole debate were on economics, that'd be fine with us. What role do you think that character and judgment should play in the people's voting for President? Well, inevitably, Bob, it plays an important role. The question is, Senator, what does your friendship with Bill Ayers tell us about your judgment? Well, first of all, I think it's important to note that Senator McCain's made this the centerpiece of his campaign at a time when we're going through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Mr. Ayers does not advise my campaign, and he certainly would have no involvement - in my White House. - You may just wanna say so... "It's important for the American people to understand who it is that's gonna be advising me in the White House." Small thing. Let's talk about what my plan does. What's our four things again? - (indistinct) - Jobs! Man, jobs. Hopefully that won't happen during the debate. (laughter) Huh? I don't... I don't remember my plan. - (laughter) - But it's a really good plan. (crowd chatter) Michelle: It is so good to see you. Now, are you guys like me? I get nervous at the debates? I hate the debates. Yeah. This is big in the campaign because this is the time for John McCain to try to turn things around. It's his last chance. Again, you launched your political campaign - in Mr. Ayers' living room. - That's absolutely not true. And the facts are facts. Obama: Let's get the record straight. Mr. Ayers is not involved in my campaign, he has never been involved in this campaign, and he will not advise me in the White House. So, that's Mr. Ayers. Now, I don't mind being attacked for the next three weeks. What the American people can't afford, though, is four more years of failed economic policies. And what they deserve is that we talk about what's most pressing to them. - Man: How do you feel, Senator? - (jet engines whirring) Woman: On the final day of his historic run for President, Barack Obama got this sad news. His grandmother had passed away. This is NPR News. Obama: You know, obviously this is a little bit of a... a bittersweet time for me. Some of you heard that my grandmother, who helped raise me, passed away early this morning. - (crowd chatter) - And, uh... Look, she... She has gone home. (crowd cheering) Here name was Madelyn Dunham. She was one of those quiet heroes that we have all across America, who... They're not famous, their names aren't in the newspapers, but each and every day, they work hard. They look after their families. They sacrifice for their children and their grandchildren. They aren't seeking the limelight. All they try to do is just do the right thing. And in this crowd, there are a lot of quiet heroes like that. That's what America's about. That's what we're fighting for. - After decades - (chatter) of broken politics in Washington... after eight years of failed policies from George W. Bush... (crowd booing) You don't need to boo. You just need... - You just need to vote. - (crowd cheering) After 21 months of a campaign that has taken us from the rocky coast of Maine to the sunshine of California, we are one day away from changing America. - (crowd cheering) - One day. Woman: That's right! Obama: Tomorrow, at this defining moment in history, you can give this country the change that we need. (scattered cheering) You can do this. Right here in North Carolina. (crowd cheering) -Crowd: Yes we can! Yes we can! -Obama: We will win this general election, you and I together! We're gonna change this country! We're gonna change the world! Thank you, everybody.

Hey, we're that good. We're getting them in and out. (indistinct chatter) Now, I read the paper this morning, saw what was going on, and as an act of friendship, I voted for McCain. (chuckle) - All set, sir? - Yes. Done. Woman: How'd that feel? It felt great. It felt, uh... I think it's the beginning of a long and emotional day. Woman: Today is history. That's what it is. It's history. When I got to my car and I saw the line, I actually cried. Man: I've never seen this kind of a line here in 20 years, so I'm feeling optimistic. It's a great sign seeing everybody getting out. This is the most important election of our life. You know, this really will determine so many things about our future. ♪ ♪ Man (phone): ...next President of the United States of America, - Senator Barack Obama! - (applause) Obama (phone): I wish that my grandmother had been here to see this, and I wish my mother had been here to see it. They're in a better place now, they're looking down on us. And yet to see my daughters be a part of this, that's something, presumably, that they'll never forget.

Young people across the board seems a little low, but I bet that they're out-sampled in the early voting. Pennsylvania's the only one that's giving me buzz. I mean, the truth is, when you think about it, I mean, for all our anxiety and everything else, when you got a black guy named Barack Hussein Obama, how could you lose? I hate waiting. Favreau: I hate it. This has been the longest day of the entire campaign. Gibbs: Yeah.
