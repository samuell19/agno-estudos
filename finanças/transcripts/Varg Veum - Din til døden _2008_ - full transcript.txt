- I know what I'm doing. - We'll look like idiots. - Would you prefer to be recognized? - What if we meet someone? We'll run. Pretend not to notice. No. Wait! Are you coming? Just do as I tell you. Okay? Come on. Come on, give me the money. Did you hear me? Or do you want to get shot? Come on then. Give them to me! I said give me the money! If you look at me, I'll shoot you. Give me the shotgun! Give me the shotgun! - I'll hit you, you understand? - Come on, give me the money! Give me the money, are you deaf? Fuck. Come on! Come on. Come on, we must run, damn it. Run! YOURS UNTIL DEATH You covered your faces, of course? Think we're idiots, or what? - We had to frighten them a little bit. - Haven't you learned anything? - Using one of ours as a getaway car? - I'll paint it tonight. Never attempt something so big without checking with me first. If I have to wait for you, nothing happens. If we continue like this we'll have the police here in no time. They just follow the skid marks and the smell of two jerks driving my car. I knew it. You see? Every time I try doing something, all I get from you is crap like this. Not even a thank you. Not a "great job, boys". Listen. Take this car, drive it out of town and set fire to it. Okay? No. No way I'll do that. The car is as good as new, I could get at least a hundred thousand for it. Never ever do that again. - Cut it out! - It's not me. - Get rid of the stuff. - Come on then! Yeah, yeah - I'm trying. Come on, come on, Lars. Cut the crap. All right, all right! There! Come on, close, close, close. - Is that your car there? - Yeah, it's mine. Shall we see if this fits? It's my car, I said. Hey! We've bought that car perfectly legally. It's been reported stolen and I've been looking for it for two days. Joakim, I'll take care of this. I'm Bjarne Pedersen. Varg Veum. I'm working for the owner, Jonas Andresen. No, no, no. We bought the car last week from Wenke Andresen. - Wenke Andresen? - Yes. You mean she reported it stolen? No, the owner is Jonas Andresen. No. That's her ex-husband. They have an ongoing conflict, so I guess you are caught in the middle. No, this car is mine. I've already got a buyer for it and you might as well tell that to your boss. - He's not my boss. - Not mine either. See you later, Veum! Your car was not stolen, Jonas. It was sold. - It was sold? - By Wenke Andresen. - Is she your wife? - Yes. We're separated. A second-hand car dealer bought it from her last week. Bjarne Pedersen. But if she has sold it and it's my car, that's like stealing, isn't it? - You knew she had it? - Yes. But she refused to return it and then she said it had been stolen. She obtained everything she's entitled to, and more. She got the flat, furniture, household goods. The bloody woman sold my car. - Bjarne Pedersen, you said? - It's in my report, the address too. Jonas, just one thing... I don't especially enjoy to be caught in the middle of a divorce settlement. - Listen, Gard... - Varg. - Are you married? - Nope. - Have you been? - I'm afraid so. Don't forget the door, will you? Hey! (Bosnian) - What are you doing? - I'm just getting my car. It's my car. Wait, will you! I've got all the papers. Go show them to the police then. Fuck! Wait! Wait! I'll kill you! Fucking hell! Feel happy? Your first win. I was so nervous. I was certain we were going to lose the case. - But you've been to court before. - Yes, but criminal law is different. It's about destinies, real people. Are you sure your client is innocent then? You're always so sure about things. To you. - Anna! - Have you had enough? - I'm working. - Aha, normal business hours now? With the clients lining up outside your office? If you get so high from winning your cases, you'll have to celebrate alone. - There's more to life than work. - I've just closed a case. Is that true? We must celebrate! - That's all right. - This will be a long day. Well, I have no plans for tonight... Was it you who found the car? Are you Varg Veum? - What car? - Do you realize what you've done? You've given Jonas yet another chance to ruin my life. - So you are Wenke Andresen? - That car is mine too! This is all very straightforward. I was hired to find a stolen car. - Stolen? He knew that I had it. - He said it was stolen. He's using you to find something to blame me for. And now he threatens to take Roar away from me. We have a boy. He's eight. Now I risk losing everything because of you. - You should be ashamed of yourself! - I didn't even know you had children. I got my car back, so I'm happy. And you got your money. Thanks. Wenke has to sort out this nonsense of hers herself. - Wenke claims the car is hers. - But it's registered in my name. - She can't just sell it. - So give her her share then. - She'll get it when she signs. - Signs? Signs what? The divorce papers. The only way to make her react is by involving our son. - She says I'm ruining her life. - Does she? - She has a sense of drama. - I don't want to be dragged into this. Could you please come? We're fully booked for tonight. I can see you've made a fresh new start. I go where the sun is shining. We own this place together. Have to move on, you know. So what are you waiting for then? Give Wenke what she's entitled to, then she'll sign. You can afford that. This is not about the money. - Okay. What is it about then? - It's about pride. Jonas! You should take advice from someone who's been there. Forget about your pride. - All right. Come on then. - What? Let's sort this out once and for all. She'll sign and get the money. Wouldn't it be better to do it later? You're coming as a witness so that she can't say later that I threatened her. - Otherwise you would have? - You don't know the woman, Varg. Jonas? Don't look at me. She could've picked a better area. If you just took the car, he will come here and claim his money back. That's not my problem. You stole my car and sold it to a criminal. - That's your responsibility. - What is he doing here? I thought perhaps you both wanted this sorted out... Varg is here as a witness. He will watch you sign this. You're getting everything you're entitled to. You show up here without warning and expect me to just do as you say? Wenke, can't you just sign it? - Give me what I'm entitled to. - What are you entitled to? - I'm trying to start over. - Don't lay hands on me! You should think of your son. If you want shared custody for him, then you sign this now. Otherwise I'll take you to court. - I want you to leave now. - I don't give a shit about that. Jonas, you're using your own son to get it the way you want. You should watch it now. I don't care if you start crying. Don't try those bloody women tactics on me. Hey. Nice place this, difficult to find. - Nobody knows about it. - Can I come in? Hi. My name is Varg. And you are Roar. - How do you know my name? - Well... I know a lot of things. - Do you want to see something cool? - What is it? A fancy car, do you want to see it? Come on, then. Is it new? It's not brand new, but it's not very old either. Look at that. You can almost reach the accelerator. See that one? Pull it towards you... Wow, that's the windscreen. - I know they're fighting over me. - No, no. They're not fighting. They just have an argument. But not over you of course. - I want to stay with my mum. - Yes, I understand you do. You can still go and visit daddy though. You know what, Roar? Everything will be all right, okay? And I'm sure they will have finished their argument soon. These are the main lights. Pull that one, see that? Daddy had a car just like that, but in another colour. Main lights. Roar, wait here. Stay where you are. Stay in the car, stay in the car! Hey! Wait up! Wenke, everything will be all right. - What happened? - I don't know. - Who are you? - Gunnar Våge. I live two flats down. I heard voices, so I popped out to check. Hey! Wenke, can you tell me what happened? - Who are you really? - Did you see anything? Wenke, where is Roar? Roar... A pity about the car. It's a nice car. The wreck? That wreck is what started all this. I gathered that much. Really too bad, isn't it. Finally you solve a big case and then your client goes and drops dead on you. - Isachsen! Find anything? - No. - Have you spoken to the ex-wife? - Yeah. She's coming in for questioning. - So, how's the widow doing? - She didn't have much to say. - So what did she say? - Would like to know that, wouldn't you? - Do you think Veum did it? - At least he's involved. I was down here with the boy. Jonas could have landed on top of me. They were arguing the boy heard them, got upset and ran out. I ran after him. Then you saw a man run from the scene. - Did you get a good look at him? - No, he was wearing a hood. - Maybe he didn't want to get wet. - I'm just trying to help. - Is the widow a close friend? - Met her for the first time today. - Good-looking woman. - Yeah. Oh, come on now. Jonas took the car with force- - from the guy she sold it to. Bjarne Pedersen, used car-dealer. Unit 1, run a check on a criminal record. Bjarne Pedersen. Do you think he was killed because of the car? Well yes, people have been killed for less. He said he wanted to move on, he was in love again. Well, he forgot to take an omnipresent wife into account. Have you got anything to hold her on? Enough to hold you too. Just wait here, I'll be right back. - Hello. - Hi. How do you feel? They won't let me see Roar and keep asking the same questions. It's just normal procedure, they always do that. - Did you ask for a lawyer? - No. Why should I do that? You've got motive, you were at the scene of the crime. They know you were having a fight, and also you stand to inherit Jonas. - Is that what you think? - What I think is not important. What the hell are you doing here, Veum? - I'm comforting her. - Is that what he's doing? Yeah. You must sign your statement and then we'll go get your boy. Wenke, perhaps you should read it first. Thanks for your help. If you need help, call me! Take it easy, you will also get a form to fill in. Varg, come on now! Finish, will you. One second, I've found the right spot. Do you realize what will happen if anyone comes? - Come on, have you finished? - All right, hang on a bit now. - Can you make this thing zoom in? - You have to go, Varg. Do you want to make it into the Police Academy? I won't talk to Inspector Hamre unless you help me now. - And he will recommend me? - Yes, I know Hamre well. - In a letter? - Yes, with logo and everything. Sit down and zoom. Yes. His face, his face. There, excellent detective work. - What do you want? - I'm looking for Joakim Kotzaco. - He's not here. - No. You're not that stupid. If you find him, I'd like to have a word with him. When did you see him last? Yesterday. We had an argument and I had to let him go. I couldn't help him anymore. What was the argument about? He's out of control. He wants to run his own game. Perhaps about time. Cold feet? Were you afraid the cops would pay you a visit? What do you think you know about this place? Not much. Just that there are more cars coming in here than going out. And that you have a criminal record. If you had been with the police perhaps you would have scared me. - But you're not. - No. And you should be glad. I know Joakim. I'm actually fond of him. I wanted him to take over so I could concentrate on other projects. Legal projects, of course? I have some property here in town, Veum, and some in Sunny Spain. To secure my retirement. I think Joakim might be in danger, or represent a danger to others. The police came around. They explained what happened. The swallow dive. I'm surprised that couple didn't kill each other earlier. I've seen how mad Joakim gets. I don't think he handed the car back gladly. Joakim wouldn't kill for a car. Between you and me, Veum... He could steal three better cars on a good day. Perhaps so. Between you and me. See, Veum. We understand each other. Don't get soft on me now. If you need a car, Veum, I'll make you a good deal. Oh hello... Has anything happened? - No, I'd like to see Wenke. - She's not feeling very well right. - Who is it? - This Veum guy. Hi, come on in. - Am I interrupting something? - No, we were just talking. It's good to talk things over, right? Just knock on my door if you need something. - Thanks for your help. - Gunnar? Since you were here when it happened... - Did you see anyone outside the door? - No. No one. Or just Wenke. You didn't hear a noise or see a shadow? - Not you either? - No. Why do you ask? Because I saw someone running away from the house. I think you saw him too. Someone you might have met before. - I didn't see anyone, I said. - But you might have met him before. He works for Bjarne, the man you sold the car to. Joakim Kotzaco. - Oh yes. - Know him? Yes. I'm a teacher. I had Joakim in school from fifth to seventh grade. Already then a bad apple. The only thing he was into was cars. Now Gunnar is my son's teacher. - Do you think that he killed Jonas? - At least he could have seen something. Have you spoken to this Joakim? No, he's disappeared. On the run. I met him a few years ago. He was drunk and proposed to make my car go missing. Insurance fraud. Almost threatened me when I refused. Well, did you contact the Child Welfare office then? I deal with kids every day. You can't help them all. You should. Otherwise things go wrong and they try to rob you. I bet you regret that you left work early the day his life took a bad turn. As a private investigator you know everything about these things. I know everything from working for years as a child welfare officer. Thanks for your help, Gunnar. Remember that what you need now is a good rest. He is a kind man. He's trying to help all the kids around here. - He's trying to help you too. - You think so? - Does he live just next door? - No, two flats further down. - Have you known him for long? - What do you mean? Look, Wenke. I'm sorry. I'm trying to find out what happened here. Jonas hated me. I ended up threatening with calling the police. But then finally he left and then I heard a scream and... - You know the rest. - So Gunnar knew this Joakim? Are you quite sure you didn't see him? At the car dealer's? No, I only dealt with this guy called Bjarne. - That did you need the money for? - To pay the bills. Jonas never paid alimony on time. He refused to give me a decent settlement. - That is why I sold the car. - Under the table? No receipts or anything? You know that Jonas went to see Bjarne to get his car back. He just took it, he said. I would have to pay Bjarne back. I think Joakim was eager to get the car back. That's probably why he came around. He could have met Jonas outside. He could. But I told you, I didn't see anyone. Could I ask you something? Did Jonas ever get violent? If he hit me, you mean? No, he didn't. - I'm scared. - I understand that. Mummy. Roar, weren't you going to have a little nap? Hi. You remember Varg, the man who was so good to you? - I never got to say thank you. - Thank me - for what? For running after Roar and taking care of him. He talked about it. - Will you give me a ring then? - Yes, sure... why? If you find anything. - What is that on his face? - I don't know. - Looks like paint. - Could be. The car had been repainted. Jonas Andresen had red paint on his fingers when he died. See what you've got on the boy. I think he will be difficult to locate. I've been snooping around a bit. - I bet you have. - That's right. He wouldn't want to talk to us anyway, so that doesn't have to mean much. No, not as long as you try to solve the case from your desk. We're familiar with this Joakim Kotzaco. Car thefts, violence, threats. Well, thank you for your help, Veum. Where would we be without you? We have someone waiting for us, so you have to leave now. Veum! My condolences. Varg Veum. If you need someone to talk to who knew Jonas... But by all means, come back whenever you want. Yes, and I'll find you here. Yes, you'll find me sitting behind my desk. Not everyone likes it. That spray is really great. Yes, okay, do that. - Hi. - Hi. - Is there anything new? - No, I'm afraid not. Nice saloon. Is it yours? - Did you want to get a haircut? - No, no, no. - Is that too hot? - No, no, no. - Is it long since you last cut it? - Yes, it's been a little while. - How do you want it? - I'll let you do whatever you like. - But no blow dry. - Why don't you just ask me? - About what? - If it was I who did it. - Was it you who did it? - No. - Do you believe me? - It doesn't mean anything what I think. It means a lot what you think. - I'm going to find Joakim Kotzaco. - Good! Do you want me to hire you? - No. Your husband was my client. - Ex-husband. I more ways than one. What if you can't find Joakim? What will happen to me then? It could be he finds you first. Or that neighbor of yours, Gunnar. Are you trying to scare me? - I thought you wanted to help me. - I'm sorry. - I can help you, I'd be happy to. - Well, well. I should guessed it. What's this, wash, styling and blow dry? Wenke Andresen, you are coming in for another questioning. - Not again? - Yes. One more time. Come on! - Why? - That is none of your business. Your client is dead and cold. Looks really nice, doesn't it. - Do you like it? - Yeah, yeah. It's important that you like it yourself. - Where have you been? - I came as fast as I could. - That's everything you need to know. - Is Wenke Andresen your client? No, but she needs a lawyer. She needs an experienced criminal law advisor. She doesn't want a lawyer. She thinks that makes her appear guilty. - Perhaps she is? - Yes, maybe. But if she wants it or not, she needs a talented, ambitious person by her side. Someone who knows criminal law and who will stand up and say no to Hamre. - Say no. - No. Perfect. - Is she arrested, accused or... is she? - I really don't know. Do you have that list I asked you to print out? Thanks. - Where are you going? - See if I can find a witness. Check out the premises of Bjarne Pedersen, who bought the car. Good luck then! Anna! It's that way. We've received some information that puts everything in a new perspective. - Do you know what I'm referring to? - No. - How long have you known Gunnar Våge? - Gunnar? About a year and a half. He's my son's teacher and also our neighbor. - Have you had a relationship? - On what basis is this relevant? You're quite young, aren't you? Are you nervous? No. Is it true that Gunnar Våge had a conflict going with your ex-husband? - No. - No? Jonas Andresen new partner told us that Gunnar Våge came to see them. Gunnar was threatening, there was a fight, and Gunnar was knocked out. That's almost a year ago now, we decided to forget about it afterwards. Våge asked Jonas Andresen to give you a substantial amount of money, right? I don't know. I wasn't there. So you did not send Gunnar Våge to see Jonas Andresen? - Are you two an item? - No. You don't need to say more. Is this really all you've got? - We're keeping her here. - On what grounds? - Risk of destroying the evidence. - You can't do that - can you? We will have to take a look at your flat, Mrs. Andresen. - Then you need a search... - We've got it. Yes, they've got it. Hello? Excuse me? Hello. Hey! Joakim. Joakim? Hello? Fuck. Bloody hell. Hey! At close range and with a shotgun. He must put someone in a very bad mood. Did you get a look at this person this time? Not the face. It was a man. A bit shorter than me, but much taller than you. He was wearing a rain coat. A medium tall guy with rain gear, in Bergen... At least it wasn't Wenke Andresen who knocked me out. No, we're letting her go. But if he killed Jonas, then who killed him? I don't know. But Bjarne Pedersen owns this place, that's how I found it. Bjarne knew him best, and they had an argument. Wouldn't surprise me if the gun is registered in his name. - I'm all right. - Gabrielsen! We should get this hero here home. He's very tired. Cut it out, I'm all okay. Back to your place, then? - Hello? - Hi. - I heard about Joakim. - Yeah. Was it you who found him? Terrible business. - Are you in for questioning? - No. - I'm waiting for Wenke. - Oh, right. Hi. - My god, are you all right? - Yeah. Just a bruise. And you? - Fine, thanks to you. - Are you ready? I have the car outside. Oh, I'll be going with Varg. - We agreed on that earlier. - Yes, that' right. Oh, I see. I understand, of course. Will Roar be in school tomorrow? Everybody's asking for him. - Yes, he will be in tomorrow. - Take care then, Wenke. And Varg. - Have I been sleeping long? - Just go back to sleep, if you want. - No, I have to pick up Roar. - I can drop you off. No, that's okay. Will you call a taxi? - Is everything all right? - Yes. I just have to pick up Roar. How about dinner tomorrow night? See you then. - How was it? - Oh, don't start now. I thought it would do you good to get laid. - That's none of your business. - Isn't it? - It's a client. - Never been my client. My client, Varg. I can't represent her if it's going to be like this. Unless it's something you really want. I don't need to know anything. - It won't lead anywhere. - What's that? Taking advantage of somebody's grief. - What are you talking about? - I bet you've fucked her already? - You don't know me, Gunnar. - What she needs now is peace. - Someone to look after her. - What do you want? - It is the most unprofessional... - Did you try to frighten Jonas too? - You've really got a nerve. - Did you want to get back at him? - You can only think with your prick. - Watch your mouth. - Tell me I'm wrong then. - You're wrong. Then tell me you love her. Tell me you know what you're doing. - I am... I am fond of her. - But is that enough? Have you at all thought about Roar? Do you want to be a new father for him, are you ready for that? Get out of here! - I'm going. - So go then. I'm going. - Hello? - Hi. Is that you, Roar? This is Varg. Remember me? - You do want to talk to mum? - Yes, please. Mummy! - Hello? - Hi. Did you find a cab last night? Yes, no problem. Roar is about to go to bed now, so you can come. Listen, I can't. I can't tonight. - Oh, I see. - I have to work with another case. - Can we do it some other time? - Yes, I'm sure we can. - Okay. Bye then. - Bye. What was so urgent? Since you couldn't wait until normal business hours? Normal people go to work before eleven. I've been working since seven. So now you're being professional. Wanted to know something about Wenke after all? I've been working, Varg. Wenke is my client. No matter what the two of you are up to. I checked Wenke's situation when it comes to the inheritance. If she inherits everything and the implications for Roar. I see, so now you'd like to stick your nose into my papers? So what you found then? That some men have a strange behavior when it comes to cars. The car they fought over is hardly worth half of its initial value. Why would a well-to-do man like Jonas- - put himself through so much trouble for a second-hand car? He even died for it. And Joakim was perhaps willing to kill to get it back. But got himself killed instead. At the garage, both Joakim and Bjarne were eager to get me away from the car. - Did the police inspect it? - Yes, I saw it myself. I don't understand... Come. Satisfied? You did see I inspected it, didn't you? But how well did you inspect it? - Perhaps in the glove compartment? - Been to the movies now, have you? You know this car is at the core of my client's row with the deceased. The least thing you can do is to be thorough. Do you actually know what you're looking for? Joakim was desperate to get this car back. It could be they were fighting over the key when Jonas died. Or something inside the car. Let me see that. Bergen Racecourse. I'll be damned. - Isachsen, give me your knife. - A link to the robbery you think? It happened the day before the murder. They got away with 170000 kroner. Isachsen. How well did you actually check this? Oh fuck. The guys who hit the Racecourse used a shotgun. Check the gun against Bjarne Pedersen. Pedersen! And I who thought you made enough money from stealing cars. What the hell have you told them? I thought I could trust you! That was before the kid died and people started hitting me with shotguns. Someone robbed the Racecourse and hid the booty in Wenke Andresen's car. We can prove that the same gun was used in the robbery and to kill Kotzaco. In our weapon registry you are listed as owner of a shotgun. Could I have a look at that gun, Mr. Pedersen? I would never lay hands on that boy. And I knew nothing about the robbery, he did it totally on his own. I believe you sent him to get the car back from Jonas. But he messed up and you took him out so he wouldn't reveal your set-up here. - I think you have to come with us. - On what grounds? For the robbery at Bergen Racecourse. For the murder of Joakim Kotzaco. And as an accessory to the murder of Jonas Andresen. What the fuck is wrong with you! I haven't done anything! Bloody hell! Hey! Help me! - Do you need some help? - Yes, it's been a while. - This perhaps? - That's a bit sad, isn't it? - Is it for a woman? - Yes. Is it to say sorry for something or just to be nice? - The first. - Then you need something different. You need this, and this and this. Hi, you've reached Wenke... Hi. Are you thinking? You get this angry wrinkle when you're thinking about something. Me too. Come on, do it again. Think. - Oh, it's been a while. - Since you've been thinking? No, this. I don't know how long it has been. But it doesn't happen every day. I wish things were different. Yes, but right now there's nothing stopping... ...this. - Did you buy yourself a cactus? - Someone gave it to me. - What do you think? - It kind of changes the whole room. Well, great for you. That she's no longer my client, I mean. - We're a good team, the two of us. - I helped your girlfriend, Varg. We're not a team. - What brought you here? - There's something you should know. I've just been to the Child Welfare office. Yes. I had to stop them from taking steps regarding her boy. Normal procedure when one parent is a suspect and the other has been killed. I had a look at file on Joakim. - Joakim Kotzaco? - Yes, the guy who got killed. And there was quite a lot on him on file there. Did you know that Wenke's neighbor was Joakim's social officer? - No, I had no idea. - Oh yes, they knew each other well. He even lived with him for a while. So this Veum, he drove you home the other day? - Did he find it easily? - Is there anything the matter? No, no. There's nothing the matter, is there? - Is Roar here? - No. He's back at school. - By the way, why aren't you there? - I thought we could have chat. You know what about. Gunnar, if I have hurt your feelings, I'm really sorry. If you're mad. But Varg and I, we... I'm not mad. But you should know, Wenke. You can't trust him. He only wants one thing. Can't you see that? - Oh please, Gunnar. - You need someone you can trust. A friend. Someone also Roar can trust. - Roar? What do you mean? - He's not in school. - Yes he is. - No. He's not. We've had some fun. He's at my place, playing videogames and eating crisps. The two of us, we have all the time we want to be alone. Did you fuck him yet? Let go of me. Gunnar! Stand still! I'm doing this for your sake. - What? - Everything. Don't you see that? - Are you so ungrateful? - What have you done? - Hi, Roar. - Hi. Is Gunnar here? Do you know where he is? Where? With your mother? You're so bloody ungrateful. Now there is nothing more stopping us. Now you are going to thank me, Wenke. Why don't you ever say thank you? Now you are going to thank me, Wenke. - Come on now! Come on! - Varg! Varg! What the fuck is going on here? - You must help Roar. Run! Run! - Call the police! Roar? Gunnar? Gunnar? My god... Gunnar! Gunnar! - Fuck. - Hey! Hey there! No, no, no, please. - Don't let go of me! - She's not interested in you! - Varg! - Please don't let go... Wenke. Wenke. Gunnar Våge? Can you please come with us. This way. Veum, I want you present during questioning. You seem to have a certain influence on him. Can I just have a quick word with her first? Go ahead. I have to stay here a bit longer. It will be all right. Then I'll go home and pack a few things for me and Roar. Where are you going? I just can't stand to stay in that flat any longer. Well you don't have to. There's room for you both at my place. I'll be over to help you as soon as I'm finished here. - You will sit in a separate room, Veum. - So where did the guy go then? Varg Veum tried to kill me. - Sure you don't want a lawyer? - Yes, quite sure. - Why did you attack Wenke Andresen? - I didn't attack her. - No? She was consenting? - Well, no. So you did something she didn't want? - Did you know Joakim Kotzaco? - Yes, I knew of him. - Did Wenke know Joakim? - No. So Joakim came to your place after having killed Jonas? Yes. He was desperate? - And you helped him? - Me? No. - You weren't friends? - No. Will you get the hell in here. Don't pull that stunt on me again! I know the case, every detail, and I know him. Let me break him. Why is he here? Well, if that's a problem, you really have to tell me why. - He's involved in the case. - Precisely. Joakim Kotzaco, a Bosnian refugee. - Who did he turn to? - How should I know? To the only grown-up he knew he could trust. He came to you, Gunnar. You were the only one who could help him. I've seen the reports from the Child Welfare office. Signed by you. A very moving story. - He would have ended up on the street. - You did a great job with Joakim. And that's why we know it's you turned to you. You let him hide in that building. I was there, Gunnar. I saw you. It was his idea. I just brought him food. You chained him up. It was an execution. That's what it was. I was there. Why did you kill Joakim? He was the one who had a problem. You might as well have handed him to us? What did Joakim see? - Did he see you kill Jonas? - No. - Did he see Wenke kill Jonas? - No. No, no, no. It was me. He saw me. He called me. He wanted money to keep quiet. Asked me to meet him in this building owned by his boss. He knew he was wanted and was sure that you wouldn't believe him. - And then you conned him. - No, I gave him money. But I didn't take the risk of trusting him. He had a shotgun. He fell asleep, I took the shotgun and chained him up. You gave him food, took care of him. I didn't want to do it, you idiot. But when you showed up I couldn't have him talking to you. A murder to cover up another murder. - Why did you kill Jonas Andresen? - He has always been a prick. I tried to help Wenke. Get him to give her the money, but he refused. We had a fight. I won. And Roar lost. I'm arresting for the murder of Jonas Andresen and Joakim Kotzaco. You're entitled to a lawyer and if I were you I'd get one. Well, you're not entirely without talent. - Wow, a compliment? - Take it easy, this was just one off. - That will happen to the car dealer? - He will be charged with the robbery. I assume you will inform Mrs. Andresen about Mr. Våge. - That's what you assume? - Yes. Veum. Take care of them now. - Are you all right? - Yeah, now I am. I just have to get away from this place. - Where did Roar go to? - He ran out. Said he wanted to be left alone. Finish packing. I'll go see if I can find him. Can I borrow a magazine? Thanks. You don't want to move? I can understand that. I moved to another city once, when I was nine. That wasn't any fun, I lost all my friends. Did you? In this new place they had a funny way of speaking, saying "rrrrr". But soon I had made new friends. And you know, you will continue at the same school. Grown-ups are stupid. Gunnar's not coming back. He is also moving. Gunnar is cool. He let me play videogames. - So you liked Gunnar? - He comforted mummy. After daddy fell down he came running out the door and over to mum. Gunnar came out after daddy fell down? When I was running up the stairs? Did you see that? Are we moving tonight? No, it's too late. Tomorrow perhaps. He fell asleep in no time. He likes you. - Do you think so? - He does. - Listen, Wenke... - Varg. - You first. - Yes, I have to say this. - He asked me not to say anything. - Who? Gunnar said that Joakim very likely would come here to hurt Jonas. Gunnar was going to take care of Joakim. But when you found Joakim killed I got really scared. - What happened? To Jonas? - Jonas hated me. But what happened to him? He said that I was the worst thing that ever happened to him. We had a fight. He could be so... you have no idea. I wanted him to leave. He was making fun of me. You saw it. Yes, but I went out to find Roar, don't you remember? I pushed him with all my might, out the door. I wanted to get him out. Varg, don't go. Why the hell didn't you say anything? Was it an accident, or just a mishap? - But I will have to turn myself in. - Okay, wait a minute. - But it's the only way... - Just wait! Gunnar deserves all the punishment he can get. Nobody knows anything! Gunnar knows everything. He is not going to say anything. He loves you. How about you? Are you sure? No, I am far from sure. - Varg, I... - Hush! Come on, mummy! Mum, I have to go. See you later then. Wow, it's all clean and shiny here. Do you think the girl's in love with you, Veum? - She turned herself in? - Yes. Exactly. Do you want some? I am on my way home actually, but just one small drink then. She would have gotten away with it, you realize that? I know. She will get maximum five years. - Can you wait five years, Veum? - Yes. I have been waiting for 38 years already, so... 38 plus 5 is 43. 43 is not so old. But getting close to 60 is another matter. - Easy now, easy. Cheers. - Cheers!
