Pardhu. Pardhu. Grandpa I am opening my eyes I will get you wherever you are. Grandpa! Grandpa is not here also, where is he..! Grandpa. A little delay and I would fall. I will never allow you to fall pardhu. Thief... Thief... Hey... I will kill you if you come close. Sir... he says he will kill me. You wait, don't confuse me.. sir! Somaiah.. See sir.. Who are you ? Hey... If you come close I will stab and kill her. Bring all the expensive things and drop them here. Why do you still think lets make haste. Pardhu... Hmm... Pardhu are you sleeping? Hmm.. When you hit the thief with an arrow. What if it missed and hit someone... Hmm... I don’t know grandpa, I saw only him. You could only see him? You saw only him? Father! I have to become a world champion in archery. I will become. Bless me father -Ummm.. -Sir Vasu come back with the cup. I promise you. Bye pardhu.. Bye.. Say goodbye to mom and dad.. [Ambulance Siren] What horrible thing happened sir. Thought he is going to play But never thought that it would be the last glance. Daddy! Must be a world champion in archery. I will become. Vasu, your dream of becoming a world champion archer has come back in the form of pardhu. He got your aim. I will make him a world champion. ♪ Hide in the paws And the lighted lamp is him. ♪ ♪ Save as the eyelid And shown world is him ♪ where will you go leaving your own village Raghu Ramaiah sir? To make my grandson complete the task that my son has started. Sir.. Careful somaiah. ♪ He became everything And landed a helping hand ♪ ♪ Winning the dream is determination ♪ ♪ I'm not without you ♪ ♪ A goal that can be achieved ♪ One minute... Pardhu don’t get scared, I am here. Aah... Grandpa... Raghuramaiah sir, parthu was nervous when he first held the bow. But as soon as you came and stood before him, he shot well, How? Before going for a play some touch the idol of god. Few trust in their finger rings But for him I’m his courage. Pardhu, although there are 32 games, in the world. Archery alone is considered as education. Bow and arrow is such a great game Never underestimate it. You have ten circles in the target board For each circle the point increases. Last circle has ten points The one in the centre is called the Bull’s Eye. Bull’s Eye is the highest point that an archer can aim. Grip should be firm. Yeah good. Now it is time for pardhu to move forward. You must have heard of kurukshetra academy. Whoever is trained in that academy have become state and national champions. Super... Super Rahul, With same spirit you practice you will be a state champion winner this time too. I don’t need state levels, But this year I must win the international championship. Other than you, who will win, Rahul ? you are the best. Hello sir... I’m satyanarayana. This is my son Abhishek My son won the under 14 competition, You are his inspiration sir. A small selfie. My son broke your under 14 record sir. Bless me grand father. -Shall I go. -well go... Thanks grandpa bye.. -Somaiah -Sir. As you said I have sold the fields. Now you don’t have anything of yours in the village. I have only sold the properties, not memories. Anyhow for how long! Once pardhu becomes a champion He will buy them all with his left hand see. Ok sir. [Phone Ringing] - Hello.. -Have you started? What started, it seems. Its not good if I come On the first day itself. -Who said so, your father? -No your fan. My fan..! Look I think he has come. Have you ever come on time? Instead of scolding why don't you ask for the reason. Why were you late. Because of this First of all it's a first day I prayed that everything should go well. If this is with you its like I’m with you Let’s go. Look at him, he’s so hot. Yeah he is, looks like he is a sports person. Umm.. Pardhu see here shall we play together. I know games well. Hey hero, can I have your number, Shall we go for a date. Rithika.. There’s green signal. let’s go. let’s go. Hmm… very good. Impressive pardhu Your track record is very good, Parshuram told me everything. As you have heard you get next level’s training here. So obviously fee is also high. As soon as possible you have to buy professional archery kit. Here the fee and training put together comes to 40 to 50 lakhs. It will cost 40-50 lakhs? I understood your problem. Don’t worry I can help you out. We need a trainer for junior camp. If you train them you will get rid of the fee problem. And we will also get a good coach. What do you say? Yes again I have won. I have won... Hey you go, Purna you come. Hey wait... You are strong like me. Hey you come. There must be strength in the hand 1, 2 ,3 ready. You asked me What those shouts were. He is our junior coach Kondababu. 6 months back when he came to me for a job I asked him to exhibit, what he knows He showed me MLA's recommendation letter. I thought we will anyhow I need someone for all the works. He likes to be addressed as sir. I too thought I need somebody to engage children So continued with him. Even before he thinks that what he is teaching is archery. I want you to go and start training kids please. ok sir.. -Rajesh. -Yes sir. -Please introduce him to the kids. -ok sir -All the best. -Thank you. -Children today we will learn a new exercise. Kondababu... he is Pardhu. I am training why are you disturbing me. He is pardhu, the new trainer. Maybe he is a new trainer But training here will be new Ask him to stand in the line and watch. Shhh, you don't need training you will never inspire. -You have it Hey... -fruit Well students today I will teach you a new exercise. Without bending your knees you have to touch your feet with your hands. I will show you once watch and learn. See.. ok. It will finish. Ok, let's do it again. Ok eyes on me. Day before yesterday when you sat you could reach it right. If I stretch more it will break may be. For shooting arrows this flexibility is enough, You can disperse. Sir warm up is over Will you start training. You are new, you will be excited like this keep it that way, wait for a week. Sir sir.. If you have to become an Archer what should we do. First you must have respect for your trainer And then remain calm. Sir how far should the target board be from us. Sir if you have to pull the string back. What exercise must we practice. Sir what should the arrow weight be. He is a coach. How swiggy swiggy order has come after taking that. Children... I will tell you Arrow must be 25 grams. If you want the string to be strong You must do forearm exercise. Between you and the target board there has to be 15 meters distance. -Do you understand? -Got it Good... Did you understand? -Yes. What did you understand? To become a trainer you have to be trained you give training I will go and come. Bye... -kondababu -sir... -Those target boards. -I will wipe. -Those arrows -I will sharpen them -Then flooring -I will clean -Then you -I will leave and come. So kids from today I am your coach I am pardhu. So how was the first day? It was good grandfather. Here the fee and training put together comes to 40 to 50 lakhs. -Grandpa... - Hmm.. That is... Don't want grandpa my stomach is full. I will go and sleep Pardhu... pardhu.. Grandpa. Grandpa. This is what you wanted. -Thank you grandpa thank you. -I paid your coaching fee. How did you manage that big amount. Why do you need? You practice well that's all. Sure grandpa. At least now will you eat food. I have an appetite in a range, let's go. It is your courage that she stands here so adamant. I will ask her you don't talk in between. Umm... ok. Enough... Wow Biryani... My sweet mummy. Why did you put scratches to that car? -Which car mother -That car. What are you saying mother, I don't understand. Listen, don't act smart that girl is Mrs shuklas daughter. When they asked me I felt insulted. She tried to flirt with Pardhu and crossed limits. That is why I put marks on it. Because of that you will put marks He doesn’t perform worth one tenth price of that car. He and his stupid game. A Street cricket player In his colony is much famous than him. He has been playing from so many years and none in the colony recognize him. Mother pardhu is a future champion. The game itself doesn't have a future and one who is is playing. That what future will he have If you roam with him. At the end you will have to do circus. Even if it is a costly car a human has to drive it. We value humans and car is estimated with price. Super, biryani... biryani. You are a gifted Archer pardhu. Even if gifted Archer wants to become a champion practice is the only way. -Go head. -Thank you Sir. Grandpa.. going to the academy it seems the sports minister is coming, okay? bye. Go and come.. be careful. What? Your body has temperature… Why don't you tell me? Like this you will be restless That's why I have not told you. Minister has come You will get late… please go. Mr.Raghuramaiah some will receive him. But I'm the only one who should look after you right? Come we'll go to hospital.. First you are important to me. -After every play. let's go.. -No... game is important . -Game is important -Okay games are important… But first we will go to hospital first From there I'll go to the academy… -Is it okay? -Ok.. Let's go… You want listen to me at all. Be Careful. Oh god why did he come.. Morning brother! Who is this new guy? Mr. Pardhu is a Big player… Our coach has appointed him as junior coach. And he disturbed my livelihood Rahul, I think our coach doesn't know the difference between a spectator and a player. That is why he says every one is a great archer. Will he defeat our Rahul now? He may try his best but the arrow will not move He will not learn archery. You and that fellow have come till here That itself is too much.. Listen to me. They are good at cleaning boards... nothing else… Divyansh -Divyansh! -Hey a look forward Divyansh focus. He is a master and you are a student. Look at him Can you still teach us? You shoot an Arrow at us? Hey wait please.. By mistake it just happened. Hey wait please.. Hey No... no.. He will beat. This is not purposely done. Hey konadababu please. Sorry.. That boy already apologized… don’t fight please. Cool.. cool.. Cool cool get back to the game. come on. Divyansh let's go. Pardhu... Pardhu. -What happened rajesh. -Today is such a lucky day man. I got full money in betting Come home we will drink fully and fall. Do you need these bettings. If lakshmi goddess wants to come in haste How can we say no. Not all that you are coming in the evening that’s all. I don’t drink. What are you saying pardhu truly you don't drink. I don't need it. I don’t have many problems to drink and neither do I enjoy it. Bye. Pardhu we shall get spoilt some other time. Last year you were in the list of state championship But did nothing. This year also you are there Other than being in the list. Is there any use with you. What did you feel You know your game. What I said is true right. You also know about your game. Good luck.. What is it This fellow wishes me good luck. To get selected at state level is not easy like giving training to school children. If you have to take training to train But to play it has to be written here. Oh no not you phone. Hello hello.. Here there is no tower Pardhu you are still a fresher to come to state level you have got time. All the present champions were also fresher's once sir. I understood pardhu. We have got pressure from top that we must send top players. Everyone in the list are all good players and you know that Rahul is two times state champion. If I have to enroll you in this list some miracle has to take place. I think you should go and start practice. sir just listen to me once. What happened you called so many times. -Where are you? -Home. What your voice is very dull. -My mood is not alright Rithika . -what happened. -What happened?-Nothing. Then what else let's go out. -Now ? -Yes.. Now itself.. Pardhu get down. Here! Get down I will tell you.. come. What happened? What will happen, When your time is not good You are forced to listen to everyone’s hambug. You will not understand. Hey... Please Rithika. Pardhu leave that I’ll show you some magic Do something and impress me. Your heart’s desire will be fulfilled. Rithika Please... Truly when I was born my father got to be fortunate.

That girl. Pink Dress! -Oh that girl. -Yeah. Grandpa always you told one thing Till you finish eating. Grandmother will not eat. Same like this girl. She will not eat until Pardhu eats. She likes Pardhu so much… Her name is Rithika. For the first time in the history of state championship. Two archers from the same academy are going to compete with each other in the finals. -Balu I'll come in a moment.-Ok.. Well down pardhu.. good job. Good job.. yes.. Wow... Pardhu... Look my side.

If you are not eating grandpa is calling me in dreams. Really pardhu Won't you believe. He thought that rithika is there's to take care of my grandson. Pardhu Look here Pardhu Look here once. This grandpa were beside you Would he feel happy if you' wouldn't eat what would feel sad. Definitely he would feel bad. So please eat pardhu… Ok.. Grandpa, what to ask me to convey I have conveyed. But pardhu is not paying heed and then it's your will. People who love us always stay beside to see our good and bad. Beyond is I cannot speak anymore philosophy. What happened Pardhu. Please. -Sorry sir. -Pardhu. Pardhu... Pardhu... Pardhu. What's wrong pardhu? Sorry sir. Umm.. If he sees me, he gets courage. This is not fatigue but acute heart problem. It's in the final stage. If we operate he will live But it will cost you 25 lakhs. -25 lakhs -Yes Instead of operation can we use tablets. If it's tablets there are 50-50 chances. That means there is a chance of 50% But sir. -Hello -Welcome. Hello.. -Thank you. -Heartily welcome Mr.Jons -Thank you! -Hi sir. Hello.. -Welcome sir. -Hello. Mr.Jons is one of the State Champion for Our Academy. Pardhu I Have About Your Technique and Style It's a longue. I am happy to you. He is Mr. Rahul two times state champion not Pardhu. Oh! Rahul I am sorry. Where is Pardhu? He is on his way. -Can we go head. -Yeah Yeah! Please. Why he behave like this.. he's leaving you a two-time state champion. He is saying pardhu. Why are we so close to not recognizing ourselves? Let's go. How long, our coach asked me to bring you immediately. Why so urgent? For what William Jones who got inspired by you has come. Good morning to one and all. It is delightful to have the world recorder mister Jones. To whom we always look upto. Today seems to be an important day in the history of kurukshetra academy. Thank you Mr Jones. Thank you... Thank you. The moment we invited you to address the archers. You immediately accepted for which we are very thankful. As you are here, for your fans can you show us the fastest aerotechnic once. Sure why not. 1.3 seconds phenomenal, He matched his own world record. Thank you, Thank you. I would like one archer from the academy. Mr.pardhu to try this shot, please come. Mr.jones, pardhu lost his grandfather recently, I don’t think he can concentrate. Its a casual performance Mr.Naresh, Common champion common. What is he doing man. 1.1 second. Rajesh, have it. Why did you stop. I know everything pardhu. For knowing pain no degrees are needed. You who fumbled before auditor when you learnt that your grandpa was sick. But have taken the world champion by surprise means. Some magic must have happened. That is only intoxication. Doesn’t he know that I’ll stop if he is not there. How can you leave like that and go. No... This is not right. This is not right. I feel like telling the coach that, I boozed and performed And I’m not right for archery. Hey do you know what you are saying They will pull your grandpa too into this. Ok now with or without your knowledge you got a way. It is intoxicating. Do not leave that magic. Use it intelligently. By the way you are not a drunkard. For you sedation is a need. Take something that a doping test can not find out. Try this. What are these drugs? No, An alternative for drinks. What most of the athletes take to handle their pressure. Only if you are caught you are a thief pardhu. This will not allow you to be caught. When will you come from this pain you also will not know. If this is the case you can't play And even if you do you can't win. The dream of your grandpa to see you as a world champion will remain a dream only. Now the nation's attention is on you pardhu Any moment doping test can be done. And if you are found guilty You need not tell. They only ban you for your life time. If you have to come out of this pain you have to be sedated. If you are sedated it will be found in the test. If you must not be caught in the test then You have only one way. And that is this. Anyways instead of moving away from the game. If you depend on it that'll be a wise decision pardhu. It's not cheating its strategy. Kurukshetra is really proud to produce a player like pardhu. Jones 1.3 seconds record is broken by our pardhu in just 1.1 second. Congrats Mr.pardhu, though unofficial you broke the record. Thank you sir. Yes Mr.pardhu before entering into the agreement as per the rule. We have to see Your performance. Yes why not Pardhu go ahead... let’s do it. -What happened -What’s wrong with him. Pardhu.. Fast. We will just be back. Sir sorry.. just two minuets. To see you as a world champion was your grandfather's dream, Maybe it will remain a dream. For you sedation is a need. If you must aim sedation is needed But if you are on sedation you will be caught in the test. If You must have aim but must not be caught in the test Then You have only one way and that is this. Yes fantastic. Yes... Fantastic. Good job pardhu.. good job.. Why so many? If you need the old pardhu, you must go in a new direction. If you need the old pardhu, you must go in a new direction. When you change channels. And you see archery you will not wait for 30 seconds also. Not 9 in 10 know that archery is born in our country. For all who never considered this game were compelled to come to stadium. And also made them wait and view on television is none other than pardhu. In any condition Being able to shoot is Pardhu's specialty. That's it We are lucky to find such an archer. Pardhu is going to surprise the country in the Olympic trails to be held tomorrow. What pardhu you came this way. Today you have your trials. -I need a packet. -You already finished. I need a packet Ok you sit I will come. Sir.. I’ll be in the stadium in an hour. Pardhu... Pardhu good luck. Hey give me a cigarette. Are all these ignoramuses like this. Whoever cheats They believe him only. -Like a sheep -Yes. Whose phone is this? Smooth Plan. Why did he come! I will lose and for that you have planned. Pardhu. Tell me why don’t you speak up What plan is it. How can I plan on you, he is drunk and has stupid talk. Hey Rajesh why should we get scared of him? Yes! we did plan.. so what? Hey shut up. I am asking you what is the plan. Pardhu.. we will talk. What was the plan? Hey let’s go. -Pardhu.. Pardhu.. Pardh.. - What did you plan. Pardhu... I'm your friend.. Calm down pardhu. Listen to me Pleas understand Pardhu. What did you plan. Pardhu.. Pardhu.. You have planned for what? You have given me your place then. How have you planned for my defeat What plan was it tell me. See! God… Where is pardhu. Pardhu where are you?. Pardhu. Any player not in time Is disqualified. Mr. Pardhu.. Is.. Dis.. There pardhu has come. Pardhu what happened to Pardhu?What are all these wounds? My God he is bleeding. Pardhu... Pardhu... What happened? -Parthdu Are you okay? -I am fine sir. Doctor…. No no.. I am good. Pardhu… are you sure? I am ready. Ok.. Yeah! Fast... fast. Pardhu.. Pardhu.. Pardhu.. Pardhu.. Pardhu.. Pardhu.. Pardhu.. Pardhu.. Pardhu.. Pardhu.. Pardhu.. Pardhu.. Pardhu.. Pardhu..Pardhu.. Pardhu.. Pardhu. What happened? Pardhu arrow has hit the other player's board. Pardhu. Pardhu. Pardhu. Pardhu... Pardhu. What happened? Pardhu. Pardhu. Call the ambulance. [Ambulance Siren] [Phone Ringing] Yes sir... I'm already at the hospital sir. He is getting treated sir. Just a second sir. Inform me once Pardhu comes into consciousness. Ok sir. Sir! Actually he is still drowsy. Hey Balu has a doctor come? I'll be there in 20 minutes. Breaking news for viewers.. Pardhu fell down not because of injury or accident. He had a habit of taking drugs But because of the drug overdose. He became unconscious. Just now we received the information. This is your pardhu's value. As you all know that Archer Pardhu has been hospitalized. Due to a minor accident. Keeping his fitness in mind. In the coming international championship game Mr. Rahul will represent the country. Sir because of the drug consumption allegation on Pardhu because of that are you removing him? No, it's rumour. Player's fitness is important to the Board. In Parthu's accident he got a strong injury on right wrist has made forearm muscles Paralysis. He couldn't even fold his fingers. This is called Barton's fracture. So, he can't play in the near future. No more questions please. Hey Balu, can I come in? Come in. He is a very good archer Balu… I pity to see him like this. I'm going to the world championship in his place. How he was and how he became now… But why does he need to take drugs? Hey did you see him taking drugs? There is no truth in that rumor and in your pity too. Don't you become so sad. He just fell down.. that's all. He will rise in game as well as in life too. You are aware of his game, aren't you? He defeated you. Did you forget that? Take care. -Hello Daddy… -When are you coming? -Coming is not possible now. -why? Why because his hand got fractured and he is on the bed. He is a hot topic all-around now. Media will fall on me if I leave him alone here. What should I do after coming home... except playing with dog.. Wait. Pardhu…. What happened to me? What is this bandage? Why am I not able to fold my fingers? Why are you not speaking? -Why don't you talk? -What should I say? You are suspended in a drug case. In your place someone is going for the World championship. Why did you take drugs? It's false isn't it? That means whatever the news on TV is… Why did you do that? Why did you need drugs to play the game? At Least tell the truth to them who feel you are their life. Tell… Pardhu.. Sir... Sir... Sir... Sir... -Pardhu you have allegations of taking drugs -Did he make you take drugs? -If you say it one more time… -Hey Pardhu leave Pardhu leave him… Listen to me all are looking at you. It would not be nice. Rithika get the car… -Will he talk about grandpa? -It's alright.. Get into the car first. Let's go. Focus… Sir.. -Good -Sir... I'm really sorry. I can explain everything to you. Please listen to me once. Rahul let's go. Cheers…. How well you planned Rahul… You told them who will get more damage. You have used the media on Pardhu at the correct time. That drug is red carpet for my international championship In the beginning you feel as if you are in the sky. But by the time you realize you will be in the lowest realm Destiny. Destiny. Where he rose, there he fell. That is what I needed I have put a simple scheme. But he has unnecessarily scratched it and lost his hand. In his lifetime he cannot play. Rajesh You have started all this by sacrificing your place in nationals. So he will believe in your word. Get him used to this by saying no doping test can find it. It is the only way for you to get out of your betting debts. So if you want to get out of them… He should make this a habit. Hey, in two days if you don’t return my money. I'll finish you and your family. Brother please leave me. I'll give you. I don't have all day…. Rajesh. You in or out. Cheers… Hey.. hey.. I thought archery was my life… But you made that go away from me. Why did you do this to me. Why did you do this. Why did you do? Why? Due to physical injuries yesterday sensation. Mr.pardhu is out of the game but now he is suspended. He attacked his co-player state champion Mr.Rahul and injured him.. Before getting a clean chit from taking drugs he was arrested in this case. Pardhdu. Where are you going… Get into the car. I'll go home… Thanks uncle. No Pardhu I can't leave you in this condition. I should go home. Pardhu we will go to my home. I'm telling you can't you understand? Pardhu what all this on the road. get into the car. Are you not able to understand… I'll not come... You go. Pardhu you are intoxicated. You are not able to understand what you are doing. What you will do alone at home. Will you beat people on the road and roam? All of us are worried about you… Can't understand? Pardhu please it may rain… We go… let's go. I'll not leave Rahul who is responsible for my condition. Hey… How many times have you taken his name? You didn't fall down because of his push. You fell down at that time he guarded you. No, you have not been defeated when your grandpa died. You got habituated to These drugs at that time you were defeated. If you have gone... go. why do you spoil her life. Dad… What is the difference between you and that Rahul? I tried to remove from the game and win. You have tried to win the game in the wrong way.. Both are the same… You are angry at whom? Why are you angry? Come dad. I never thought A day would come to say this word to you. I regret loving you. I made a mistake loving you. I regret loving you. I made a mistake loving you. I made a mistake loving you. I regret loving you. I made a mistake loving you. I'll never allow you to fall Pardhu. I will never allow you to fall Pardhu. Good morning Pardhu… Where are you… Come near.. Ah... I'm able to see. You are good. Where is he? -Master I think you drank in the night. Take this and have it. Where am I You are 50km away from the city. In my house. You have this… I tell you. I was waiting to meet you… but I saw you swaying on the road. In a few seconds you would have gone. Do you know? If you would have known about me You will not save me. Anyway thanks for saving me. Where will you go? To Rithika who avoids you? Will you go to your grandpa's house. or the coach who ignores you. How do you know all this? Your grandfather wanted to see you as a world champion is no more. Because you lost him you got close to alcohol. Since you felt that it in alcohol you could as well you made a mistake. To Save yourself from being caught you got used to drugs and made another mistake. You killed your grandfather forever who was living in your game Pardhu. Keep it up! What do you know about me? Whatever comes to your tongue you speak You are talking about my grandfather Yes I lost my courage and victory with him itself. My grandfather who taught me everything did not teach me how to live without him. Because I can't get over that pain I got close to alcohol. To stand in the game I took drugs. I know it's a mistake sir. That is why I am unable to face anyone. From the time I learnt that he lost his life because of me. I am unable to get over it sir.

The boy's name is Amar an entrepreneur. He asked me for permission to take you out. Your future with Amar would be safe and secure. The parents of a girl child need that peace. Evening Amar is coming to take you out. Please go and come. Pardhu bro! Why are you so dull? Pardhu Brother! What do you want to eat? What do you want? -I would like a chicken biryani. -I would like noodles. I want chicken 65 Brother.! Are you okay. Is this place ok Rithika. Hello Rithika Rithika come let's down. Sit down... come. Rithika what do you want to have? Rithika I don't consider your past please move on. The girl looks great! She is pardhu’s girlfriend right Then why did she come with someone else? Because pardhu has become old That is why she came with the new fellow. Boss mind your language she is my would be. What he said is right It broke there and here you took it. That’s all isn’t it ? Shut up mind your business. Don't look that side and eat look here and eat. Rithika let's leave this place is not good. If it is like this not just 2, But 20 also will fall. Hey what are you saying mind your words. Rithika please leave will call the cops. Hey are you mad, till they come, should I tolerate his words. Rithika please let the cops handle. Hey, what will you do other than tolerating. Hey... Hey! He is beating me, you come quickly. Hey... Hey... Rithika hey your bracelet, take it. Enough of the vengeance that you showed on the rope. come let's have a drink. Are you surprised Me and offering a drink? If you know when to stop you can drink pardhu That's no mistake Now speak up. Pain doesn't mean crying pardhu. But unable to cry. That is even worst Tell everything. What do you want me to tell sir, When I thought if few people are in my life I can win the World and they move far from me. I am unable to make out if it is my mistake, habit or my fate I lost my parents in my childhood, lost my grandpa, With my own hands have I distanced Rithika. I don't know how to tell this pain I got love without asking. So no value. No value.. I don't need hundred people but the one who loves me also doesn't want me. Then why do I need this victory sir. If you sincerely apologise It can melt any amount of anger. Sorry… I must tell to whom and how? If someone is ready to hear. Someone has come into her life sir. She's feeling sorry for my words It's a dead end sir. Decide what you have to do You don’t decide on what will happen. You tell so many things, You say that someone has come into her life. Then why does she still have the bracelet that you gave her why is it so. We should take care of this There are many important issues. If we don't pay heed it will be a problem. Till yesterday rithika looked dull and I know the reason. But after going out with Amar. As if she found something that she lost. I saw that she was happy I was thinking that maybe she liked Amar. But I learnt that they saw you Amar told me. Amar said when she has pardhu in her thoughts. I cannot be beside her and he left from her life. Pardhu I don't know if you have changed or not But for sure I know that you will take care of my daughter. I accept your entry into my house. But to enter into my daughter’s life Will Rithika accept and oblige? It is in your hands. Rithika it's time your father will Come. Why is this fellow here! What is he doing here! I have made so many mistakes that nobody can forgive Rithika. Yet you were with me. But for one mistake of mine if you have abandoned me I understood how grave my mistake was. When I was small and someone said something against my grandpa. I went to hit him. But I have raised my hand against your dad. Forgive me uncle. Shall I say something Rithika. When you realise that you can't live without that person. You get close to that person But for me from the time you slapped me. I got a feeling that I can never live without you. -I will leave. -wait Coming and leaving everything is your wish. You made a mistake and what without an apology you are leaving? Say sorry... Don't smile... Say sorry. -Sorry. -Not that way Hold hands and say sorry. I am sorry... Extremely sorry. -Will you fight with me again. -No… -Will you leave me and go. -No. Tell me. I will not go anywhere. I am sorry really sorry. Pardhu.. What is all this these balloons decoration and everything. Rithika! Rithika you look good. What anything special? Happy Birthday grandpa. My birthday..! So you only said that if we don't have loved ones in our life. There are no celebrations. We are in your life Happy Birthday sir. -Happy Birthday sir.. -Happy Birthday. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you dear grandpa. . Happy birthday to you. -Sir.. -Ramu. -Ramu come here! - sir -Are you alright? -Yes sir -Where is pardhu? -just now he went out with kids. What? Sir by tomorrow the four month span time what you gave pardhu sir comes to an end. -Tomorrow ask pardhu to go to doctor -ok sir. You can come to work from tomorrow morning. Ok sir. Open your mouth, drink the medicine that I asked you to drink. It will get reduced, take him. Tell me. Hello sir have you recognized me. -Pardhu, are you alright. -Yes sir. You told me that after 4 months you would remove the bandage. I am anxiously waiting when to touch the archery. Four months time removing the bandage. what are you Saying pardhu. You only said. You only said that if I take the medicine given by you I will be alright in 4 months. I haven't said that, just wait for 5 minutes outside. Did you bring him here Without knowing the truth or after knowing it. what happened? His wrist and the muscle are badly injured. Slowly they will be without any life and sensation. With this medication we cannot bring it back to the same status. If you say so how there must be some way out. Saradhi, why do you talk like a small child. Even if we try our best it can not be better than 30%. Did you understand. That's ok that's enough. I will tell this matter slowly to him you start medication. Ok, your wish. Be careful. Saradhi sir. Saradhi sir! Saradhi sir! Sir pardhu. Saradhi sir -Give me a hand. -What pardhu your call looks like shouting. -I am coming from the hospital. -Ok what is the doctor saying. Don't you know what he says. Why did you deceive me. Saying my hand would work and cheat me What did I do to you sir. You don't know Rithika, wait he is a cheat. He's become old and that's why his mind is not working. 4 months he made me do the circus here. Pardhu sir! do not talk about Saradhi sir without knowing. -Ramu. -sir. Pardhu... Pardhu...Pardhu... When you are shouting at me I am not getting angry. I understand your position Had I told you the truth on that day itself. Truly you would have fallen before a lorry. That's why I have postponed the truth I did not deceive you. Your strength is not your hand but your aim And to reach that your hand helps that's all. All these days what you have done is not a laborious job. But practice for your championship it's a practice. Every work that you did is not to bring your right hand back. But to prepare your left hand. Now the hand that should supports is changed and the aim that your eye takes is changed. For that your plan must change Your practice must differ. I have changed. In this 4 months that has happened. Ramu, pardhu take that stone with your left hand. Take it. There is a pillar behind you Aim at it and hit. Why are you thinking? throw. You hit the target exactly on the pillar which is hundred meters away. Tomorrow in the competition your target is 74 meters. The stone's weight is 2 kgs. To shoot the arrow this strength is enough. -Ramu. -Sir. Pardhu. Doctor said that your hand will work only 30% and that is enough. Take it. Pardhu, victory is right before you. Ramu... Pardhu... I kept my word I said I will help you take part in the competition. Now it's your turn. So Mr.pardhu, have you come to appeal to us To lift the case that’s alleged against you. We thought we would get an Olympic medal through you. But instead you brought us Defame, and shame You hit a player Who was selected for the nationals Do you at least realize what a big offence it is? Above that you have drug consumption allegations on you Tell me what should I put a side and listen to your explanation explain. Tell me I want to know. Other than me nobody knows the mistakes I have made sir. With that I have looked down upon the game. I have lost the faith that you invested in me. Even then I came here to tell. you the truth and seek for forgiveness. The day though there were no traces in the test. I have taken drugs and that is the truth. I told you Agasthya You did not trust me. Otherwise how can one become a state champion in the first year itself. Yes sir I did take drugs but not for performance in the game. But to forget my pain For I lost the person who has shown me how to walk in life. And I didn't know how to put a step forward, So I took it. Whatever may be the reason but to play that way it is wrong sir. Forgive me. If I tell this I know what will happen. But yet I cannot make another mistake without confessing this. Whatever I have done so far it is for the game. If I should have that I must tell the truth sir. I may win by doing a wrong But by telling a lie I cannot live sir. I’m not giving this Because I’m angry with you. But because you have trusted me and given it to me as the best player. This is the only memory that I have with my grandfather who wished. that I must get this medal. But had he been here. He would have been proud at my decision sir. Because for all the stupid works that I have done. It is better to return then keep it with me sir. In fact that is the right respect. Sir,I know I will not make any mistakes hereafter I admit that I’m guilty. Thank you. why did you meet the committee? where were you all these days. What did the committee say to the rumors against you. It seems you were caught That is the reason you left this place. Have you proven that you took drugs? -Tell us -Tell us mr.pardhu. You make us sit high and also push us from there. You only need questions but not the answers thank you. Thank you! Come here. I'm sorry for what happened at the hospital on that day. Ok.... I think we must rethink about this case. How can that happen agasthya. If you give him another chance that will be come a practice for others. And how can he manage with left hand. Moreover he has angry issues. Have you forgotten how he hit Rahul. You people remember pardhu who made mistakes But for me I see a transformed pardhu. I am not sure on this agasthya. On top of it he has consumed drugs. Had he not told us would we get to know about it. Do we have it on records. If he is ready to forego, what he struggled and earned. Then he has realized that more than the player it is the game which is important. If you give a chance to the one who is a changed personality Then it will not become a practice George But it would be a chance to others Everyone who were surprised with his aim in archery What has happened to him for such Indian archery academy has given a surprise news. Pardhu is representing India in the world champion ship as a second player. Now let's learn what people think. How? How did they given a second chance. welcome to 51st world Archery championship. It is the first time that our country is given an opportunity to host these competitions. In this present archery world number one china and other seven countries are participating. And recent all best players to this competition In the same manner if one is Rahul the other is. Pardhu has given the last entry. In this you have knock out, quarters, semi finals, finals. You have four stages, Totally you have 16 players The best two Highest score players They will be in the final round. We now have in the knockout Rahul from India and angli from China. It would be say tough situation in first round to india with world champions. Rahul score 28 Is angli scores 10 points then the score would be 29 and he can cross this knockout stage. Angli has scored 10 points. Fantastic performance from China and bad news for Indian fans. India lost a good player. That Rahul has lost had had he got defeated with our pardhu it would be great sir. Rahul is not pardhu's enemy. For pardhu to rise so high, Rahul is the reason. Now pardu pardu must win. Pardhu is now going to play his first match with Korean. Can injured pardhu cross this knockout stage. Now pardhu needs 10 points. From the beginning itself, pardhu created tension. This is not just the last Arrow but the last hope that Indians have. Pardhu has won over 2nd Korean Archer Not just surprised us but the whole nation. India into quarter finals. Rahul.. You came to remind me of my defeat or your victory? I just want to remind you that you are not defeated yet. We are not playing here. Its India playing. Till I'm playing it doesn't mean you are defeated. Your students is not yet defeated sir. In this world championship keeping the hopes of the Indians alive. Pardhu has played well and entered into finals. He was once India's hope. But you was Injured and expelled from the game. Now with his left hand he came so far. Can he create history for India. China reached the final as we predicted. India reaching the finals. I never expected that the finals would be so interesting. Number one player vs injured sensation. Two best archers compete with -each other how it would be? Pardhu shooted arrows 10 out of 10 And won the set. By seeing Pardhu's form India will win the world championships for sure. With one point Angli has scored second Set In 1 set India won in another set China won, Yet angli is above pardu with one point. How? In this entire tournament if angli hit the bull's eye 7 times,. Pardhu shot the bull's eye six times. excellent pardu shot in one bull's eye and scored equal with angli. Cheater.. Cheater.. Cheater. Cheater.. Cheater.. Cheater. Your dad will be a champion as well. Pardhu seems to be disturbed. This is shocking. Thought pardhu will surprise us But it is not so, he fell down. Seems to be India has no hopes left on victory now With doubled enthusiasm angli hit 8. Seems to be That angli will win the match What a twist in the match. Pardhu the present that you can give to this country & your father is to become a champion. Time is running up -Mr pardhu are you ready. -Ready. Remember, the diamonds are born in pressure's. Pardhu is taking out an old bow from his bag sir. Pass the bow. There is no time. And when you wont get an opportunity In every NOOK and corner of your mind. And your heart must say just one thing. All the blood in the body should gush to one point. Only then the injured handalso will aim at one thing Pardhu. What is it sir pardhu is removing his bandage. -Is he removing his bandage. -Hmmm. So is wanting to prove that he is not backward with his right hand. With which hand he has lost everything He wants to bring back. The twenty years dream of becoming a champion. Has been shared by all parts of his body. That is called muscle memory. It is not the inference hand. That Hand remembers both his aim and training. The day the hand returns the old magic will start Balu Can you see strength in his hand Pardhu is about to shoot his last arrow. Even if he hits 10 it would be a draw and nothing else. It will happen, through shooting bull's eye But there is already an arrow in the bull's eye Yes, even then they can score. Though robinhood's shot is already in the bull's eye If one arrow tears the other arrow and passes through it Pardu will be the highest player who will have shot the bullseye in the tournament. But can parthu make this impossible shot with his injured hand? Unbelievable... Parthu has set a new world record with a Robin Hood shot. India has won the world archery championship. The maker who brings out the pardhu in you and makes good sculpture of you is in you. The moment you recognize him the victory is yours.
