Counting my days from the cage. In so many ways it's all that I've known. Cell's been my home. Chaotic environments. I've been going through violence, still screaming in silence. All I wanted was a shelter, warm bed and a pot to piss in, and daydream for better livin'. Stop! I hate living in this nightmare. ? I was born inside A wind parade Crying on the best of days ? ? Almost pushed stop on The tape inside an Escalade ? ? In those last moments Spilling out into the Interstate ? ? Estimate the lost To the universe Don't escalate ? ? Back to the soil Back to the flower beds ? ? Back to the Crown Royal Then it's back To the toil, black ? ? Spinning while These Other motherfuckers Was spilling raps ? ? Ready to die, ready to fly Why I skipped the track... ? Randolph, get up. You've got court. ? ...and slow down Whatever go down ? ? I'll take it all New romantic when he puffing ? ? The trees And stake it all on the work ? ? And if I follow my bliss For model chicks ? ? They steady loving The way that I spit ? ? I'll get to live, uhh ? ? I'm alone in the city, black Fitted cap back ? ? With a pretty young thing When I'm sitting back ? ? Ice grill 'em on a warm day Lifetime ? ? Catch me on the block Blowing dice Or I'm flowing nice ? ? When the city lights Bright in the night time ? Looked over those notes, it's pretty open and shut. Remember, we have the German case management meeting in the morning. - We'll be back in time. - Good. Nervous flyer? Yes, Sir, a bit. Quite an honor. You need to fly in the corporate jet your first week on the job. I've been here eight weeks, Sir. Excuse me? Been here two months. But thank you. Name's Keisha... James. ...clear to take off. Relax, Miss James. This plan is courtesy of Cal Air. Our largest client, 39 percent of our billables. Okay. Judge, if you grant their motion, Cal Air will have completely destroyed a mom-and-pop company that has been flying families over Lake Michigan for 30 years. - This isn't equitable or fair. - This isn't about equity, Your Honor. - Well, I notice you left out the word "fair." - In this case the law states-- I mean, you have already decided the case. I'm sorry, Mr. Counselor, but the court has no choice but to follow the law. Next case, the State of Illinois versus Jamal Randolph. Mr. Randolph. This is the fifth time I've seen you this year. I see you more than I see my grandchildren. And that is a problem. This time it's two OxyContin pills that you gave to your... your fellow inmates. Yeah, my boy was hurting and he had these shakes. Mr. Randolph, you have three weeks remaining on your present sentence. I'm gonna tack on an additional week. Man, this is some fucking bullshit. Mr. Randolph, you're on your way out. You stay out of trouble. Mr. Randolph, re... re... return here. Return here back to the podium. You have another case in here in this court, a civil case, that's due up for trial in two weeks, correct? - Yeah. - Mm-Hm. This case has been bouncing around this court - for what, six years now? - Your Honor, I'm sorry, I'm Jamal's mother. We've tried but we haven't been able to find anyone to help us. Mr. Randolph, do you wish to proceed? Yeah. Well, representing yourself is not a good idea. Mr. Trainer, please return to the podium. Please. - Uh... - Please. Well, I see, Trainer, you have an impressive record here. It... uh, from the looks of it you've managed to turn down every case in which any court has attempted to appoint you to represent an indigent client. Your Honor, if I may? Ah, ah, did I ask you to speak, Counselor? No, you may not. According to the docket, you have never handled a pro bono case for this court or any court. I make donations. I... I write a lot of checks for charities. Accepting appointments to represent a client who cannot afford a lawyer is responsibility that you owe to the bar. And I have a responsibility to my corporate clients and my firm. Mr. Randolph, meet your new lawyer, Michael Trainer. - Oh, hell, no. - Your Honor, my practice is confined to corporate litigation, not-- Unconfine it. Next case. Kanan versus Melissa. What the fuck just happened? Jesus, we got three trials next month. How are we gonna try this case? We're not. You're gonna find a conflict. Can't we just assign someone from the firm to the case? They have legal aid for people like him. People like him? Don't do that. You know what I mean. Okay. Now, let's not gonna rush this because I've seen this go terribly wrong. No, no, my daughter's idiot ex-husband Barry, cursed him from the start. At the wedding I'm making the toast around the table, Barry comes in hard, six glasses shatter, - champagne goes everywhere. - Oh, no. So before we raise a glass, I want to say, Bellcore will be the first private foster company to go public ever. Vince, what are the stock projections? Three-hundred-percent increase in year one, - plus or minus twenty percent. - Okay, I'll take that plus or minus. Ms. Dupree, where are we at with the collateral litigation? Ten lawsuits in total. Six should be dismissed by the end of the month. Three we can settle for under fifty. Six and three. That's nine. Yes, there's a kid in Chicago. Just got assigned a lawyer, corporate guy. - Shouldn't be a problem. - Oh, I see. Okay, come here, let's make sure that it's not a problem. - Yes. - Okay. Good enough. Now come in gently... My key still works. It might be better if you'd knock. Of course. - Where's Benny? - He's back in his bunk. - Hey, Benny. - Yeah? - Your dad's here. - Okay. You don't... don't... you don't have to do that. I, uh... I can't take Benny for the whole weekend. - What is it this time? - I have to go to Chicago. - Are you two arguing again? - No. - How you doing, buddy? - I'm fine. Hey, uh, show your dad your picture. Oh... that's terrific. It's you. He... he drew a picture of you. I... I tried to get out of it, but the judge forced me to take - a pro bono case. - What's pro bono? Pro bono. Well, that's where the judge forces you to do something for free. - How come? - You got me. When somebody can't afford a lawyer, the judge tries to be helpful and appoints an attorney. What happened to him? He got hurt and he wants money from the people he thinks are responsible. - Will they give it to him? - Maybe a little. Did they only hurt him a little? The company doesn't think that they hurt him at all. What do you think? I think he'll be lucky to get a dime. Come on. Hey. - Come on. - Bye, Mom. Bye, sweetheart. Have fun. - I love you. - Love you, too. We'll settle this by noon and be out of here. All right. How do you think this kid's gonna present? Like a thug. Yeah, that's not gonna help. Mr. Trainer. I'm so glad to finally meet you. I'm... I'm Shaina. Excuse me, I'm Shaina Randolph, Jamal's mother. My husband and I googled you and your reputation is impeccable. Well, Miss Randolph, you can't believe everything you read on Google. A liberal invented it. Excuse me, could you remove his cuffs please? Protocol. - James Randolph? - Jamal. Jamal Randolph. Okay. Today we are going to have a pre-trial. You know what that is? That's where we try to settle this case and get some money in your pocket. You'd like that, wouldn't you? Just some bullshit. The defendant, Bellcore Family Services has offered you 40,000 dollars. I'd like to get that up to say 70, 75. - Does that sound good? - Nope. All right. Maybe 80. It ain't about the money, three-piece. It's always about the money. And three-piece suits went out in the '80s. - Are you deaf, old man? - Maybe 90. Why the fuck do I have to have you as my lawyer? You're a real charmer, you know that? Judge Taylor will see you both in chambers. You work on it. You know you should count yourself lucky to be represented by Mr. Trainer. - Oh, yeah? - Mm-Hm. Now, how much does he pay you to kiss that ass? - Michael Trainer. - Samuel Collins. Judge, we have told the plaintiff we'll pay 40,000 if he'll take it. My client's digging his heels in but I'm still working on it. So what's your demand? Offer a hundred. Let's see what we can do. I may be able to do 75. Mr. Collins, do you mind if I have a moment with Mr. Trainer, please? Thank you. Mr. Trainer, well, the last demand by your client, before you were appointed, uh, was, uh, 20 million dollars. Now hundred thousand dollars, that seems a little uh... a little shy - in comparison, wouldn't you say so? - Yeah, - 20 million dollars? - Uh-huh. It's totally unrealistic. Did the allegations that when, uh, Jamal Randolph was a ten-year-old child, Bellcore negligently ignored his repeated complaints when a 16-year-old, who was also in place, brutally raped and tortured him for a three-year period. - Yes, I've read the case. - Ah. They're allegations, as you say. Well, Bellcore, that's a private corporation that buys contracts from the states for foster care, is that right? It's a business, a big business. There's nothing illegal about that. - Is Bellcore your... your client? - Excuse me? Well, you seem to know more about them than you know about, uh, Jamal. Your Honor, this is a respected corporation versus a kid that looks like a thug. Thug. What does a thug look like to you? It doesn't matter what I think, it's what the jury sees. It's the whole package, the attitude, the hair. Hair? Why are you selling out your client? I sell out nobody. Who do you think you are? Sit down. I'm gonna have you disbarred. Fine. I could retire tomorrow. Go. Then maybe you can get that money that you did protecting those corporations then you can retire to your private golf club and then you can stand over your putter trying to get the perfect putt knowing goddamn well that you haven't done anything for anybody but yourself. Get out of my chambers. I'm sure you have someplace else to go, Mr. Trainer. What are you looking at? Remain seated. All right. Have you gentlemen reached a settlement? No settlement. Okay. Trial starts Monday morning at 9:00 a.m. Start picking the jury. Monday? I can't. That doesn't give me time to prepare. That's what the last two weeks were about. Monday, Mr. Trainer. Your Honor, I need to clean my client up. I need to get him a haircut. I handle cases, I'm not a barber. I can't put my client in front of a jury looking like this. Side room in there if you like. All rise. Don't even be thinking about touching my hair, three-piece. Let me tell you something, kid. You want me to try this case, I guess I have to. But there's one thing that I don't do and that is lose. - I'm not your kid. - Clearly! Back up, three-piece! Keisha, figure this out. You ain't touching my hair, girl. Name's Keisha, not Girl. Don't be like them. To win, you got to play the game, especially their game. Come on now, you don't want to scare these white folk, do you? Start the car, get the heat going. See if you can find some hotel rooms in this city. How come you're playing his game? - I'm not. - Please. You're following the man around, you're doing his dirty. You think this game only belongs to him? Well, it don't. Belongs to me just as much. Besides, I'm playing what I need to get to where I need to get. All right, girl... I mean, Keisha. All right. All right. For your opening statement. Thank you. Yeah, take these depositions and give me an outline of my cross exams by tomorrow morning. We got nothing, you know? This is a joke. No, we've got a young man with no money who won't accept an $80,000 settlement. That's something. What happened at chambers today? Nothing. Mind if I join you, Mr. Trainer? Do I know you? Pamela Dupree, vice president of Bellcore Family Services. We didn't get a chance to meet in court. Uh... You know we looked you up, Michael. You're normally on our side of the fence. Doing your homework. I also read that you're a bit of a wine snob. C?tes du Rh?ne. It's your favorite, right? "C?tes", the "s" is silent. Must be frustrating being stuck in Chicago away from your family. Well, I don't have much of a say in the matter. Sometimes I find a glass or two of wine is more productive than hours in a courtroom. Good point. Thank you. You know, we're not so different, you and I. I worked my way up through the company, started as a caseworker, then manager, now I'm vice president of claims and a major shareholder. Because of who you are and the type of clients you have, I think we can get this up to a hundred thousand. The kid won't settle. Bellcore took over where the government failed, Mr. Trainer. The State had over 20,000 kids in Child Services. Now we do it all. Pretty soon Bellcore Family Services will be in all 50 states. - Private companies do it better. - Yeah, private companies do some things better. They make a good fork, a good knife, a nice glass of red wine. The trouble is a child is not a product. You joining the Green Party? I'm sure you'd know if I was. Jury's not gonna believe a black drug dealer. A couple pills, I'll keep it out. Won't keep out the color of his skin. - The kid is a mess. - Kid was a mess before Bellcore got a hold of him. The kid was four years old before Bellcore got a hold of him. - Where were the parents? - Maybe Bellcore never told the Randolphs about Joey Poule's violent history. I'm authorized to go to 150,000, that's it. Wow. You just went to $150,000 and I haven't had a sip of that red wine. This is a nuisance case, Mr. Trainer, just like the dozen or so you and I have handled over the years. Take the offer to your client, then you can go back home to your son, Benjamin, is that it? We've completed the jury selection. Are you ready to proceed? Your Honor, may I have a minute? I'll let you have five. Then I'm calling the jury. Thank you. - Bellcore upped the offer to 150,000. - I already said no. What? What did you see? That's her. - Ms. Dupree! - That's enough! You get inside. Good morning. Bellcore offered $150,000. I have a fiduciary responsibility to tell you that - that's a lot of money. - Did they... ever put a criminal in another home like they did with us? There have been other allegations. - I need to talk to you outside. - Sure. What are you seeing there, Mr. Trainer? Do you see a young man who has lost three years of his life? Do you see his shame? Or is all you can see is another opportunity to be done with this case? Miss Randolph, with all due respect-- You're a father, aren't you? I'm telling you now, we are not gonna settle. Shine a light on what they did, fight for that child as if he were your own. Jamal was eight. It's pretty difficult those first few months. Never heard so many curse words. Bill, they are here. I thought they were coming tomorrow. It doesn't look that way. Just put that stuff. Mr. And Mrs. Randolph. I'm Ms. Dupree. We spoke on the phone. How are you? - Hi. - Hi. - Hello there, James. - It's Jamal. Jamal then. Did Jamal ever talk about his past? It was off limits. Pamela Dupree placed Joey Poule in your home, is that correct? - Yes. - Did she ever talk to you about Joey's past, uh, any violent tendency-- Objection, Your Honor, we have never established that either Bellcore or Ms. Dupree would have had access to that information. Sustained. How long after Joey moved into your home did you begin to see a difference in Jamal's behavior? I should have seen it right away, but I didn't. Easy, girl, easy. What you doing? I wonder what Sasha would look like with the pitchfork sticking out of her. I know this must be difficult but... can you explain to the jury the changes that you saw specifically? He became angry, distant, sometimes he didn't leave his room. And this was because of Joey Poule? Objection, Your Honor, requires speculation. - Sustained. - No further questions. Thank you for being here, Mrs. Randolph. I understand that it's very difficult. We'll try to make it as easy as possible. How much were you paid to be a foster mother, - Mrs. Randolph? - I don't know. We have receipts, $450 per month? I... I guess. I didn't count it. And you took in over 20 children over the years, is that correct? - Yes, but-- - Four-fifty per kid, that comes to over $145,000 you made. Is that right? We spent it on the children-clothing, food. You own a farm, Mrs. Randolph, you grow food. - We do. - In fact, I see that you recorded a surplus for going on 10 years now. Bill has a green thumb. It appears so. A 10-year surplus, you made hundreds of thousands of dollars. Tell me something, is this a picture of a new truck that you and your family have bought? Exhibit 25, counselor. We bought a new truck, yes. And this one, is this a picture of your new tractor, 26? Because the old one broke down. Of course. Of course. But this new one is a lot bigger than the old tractor, isn't it? - Covers a lot more ground, plows a lot more land. - Yes. Meaning bigger profits for you and Mr. Randolph. - When the crops are good. - I'm sure you'll do fine with Mr. Randolph's green thumb. - Objection, Your Honor. - Sustained. - Stick to a question, Counselor. - Fair enough, Your Honor. Question, Mrs. Randolph. Am I correct here in reading that you have already applied to Bellcore - to host, yet, another foster child? - Yes, that is true. In spite of the alleged horrifying experiences with Joey Poule? Children need help, Mr. Collins. Are you helping the children, Mrs. Randolph? - Or, are you helping yourself? - Your Honor. Don't answer that question, Mrs. Randolph. Counselor, you're pushing your luck. I have no further questions, Your Honor. Jamal. Jamal. Jamal. Fuck him and what he said about my mom. That's his job, he's trying to get under your skin. Fuck his job, three-piece. Mr. Trainer, call your next witness. All right. It's time for you to get up there and tell your story. What is it? - I can't. - You can't? Okay. - Then I'll go over and accept their offer. - No. Those are your options. Either you accept their offer or you tell your story. Plaintiff would like to call James Randolph to the stand. State your name for the record. Please state your name for the record. Say your name. Um... James Randolph, but I... I go by Jamal. Good. Jamal, one of your first foster homes was with Stephanie Myers. Tell us what happened. I, um... Where the fuck you been, boy? - What you got to say, boy? - Nothing. Get over here. So you play with yourself all the time. What'd I tell you about playing with yourself? You want to grow up to be a faggot? No. Little faggot playing with yourself in front of me. You disrespected me. That's what you're doing. You little nasty piece of shit. - You don't remember? - I... I don't remember. Okay. Well, uh, let's move on for the moment. Uh... after the Myers you moved in with the Ryan family. Uh... do you remember the Ryan family? You stayed with them before the Randolphs. Don't you remember? You lived with them. You'll get two of these a month. Miss Dupree. Look at me. - You look at me. - Miss Dupree! Miss Dupree! Please. Jamal. Jamal. Jamal, I asked you a question. What... what... what, man? What do you remember about the Ryans? - Nothing. - Jesus Christ. Excuse me, Counselor. He said nothing. Let's move on to the next line of questions. Your Honor, may I have a quick word with my client? Okay, we'll take a five-minute recess. You asked why do you have to have me as your lawyer. Why do I have to have you as my client? Do you ever think of that? Hmm? No. Because you're too busy thinking the world owes you something. I'm the bad guy, right? I ask you to settle, I'm a sellout. I wear nice clothes and I'm a fucking three-piece. You don't know shit about me. So let me tell you a little bit about myself. I know how to practice law. That's what I know. I know how to win cases. So if you want to win, you've got to go out there and you've got to tell those 12 people getting paid $15 a day your story. If you don't want to win, then don't talk. - I'm trying. - Good, because your five minutes are up. Tell us what happened, Jamal. Why did you file this lawsuit? Jamal, why did you file this lawsuit? Answer the question, Mr. Randolph. - Tell us what happened. - You little piece of shit. Why did you file this lawsuit? What are we even doing here? - Tell us what happened. - Leave me the fuck alone! - All of you! You don't get it, man! - Order. - You fucking listen, man. - Order. You don't want to get it, right? So fuck it. Fuck this shit. - Order in the court. - Fuck it. I'm out of here. This is some bullshit. - Get the fuck out of my way. - Back in the witness stand. No, I'm not getting back on the stand. - Calm down. - Jamal. Fuck out of my way... Hey, Jamal! Easy. Get up. Get him out of here. I told you, man. I told you. Ladies and gentlemen, yeah, the trial resumes tomorrow morning at 9:00 a.m. Michael, can I talk to you? Tell Jeff, he'll fill me in. No, Sir, I need to talk to you. I think you should stop talking at Jamal and try listening to him. Have you been paying attention at all? That's all I do is listen. You want to help me, tell him to start talking or we're going to lose this case. Jamal left these behind. I think it'd be good for you to take a look. - Why are you here? - Because I'm your lawyer. You can withdraw from the case. I'm not gonna fight you on it. I don't want to. I believe you. I lost my shit and the jury see me get tased, so the game... - is over. - Now, the good news is that the jury decides when it's over and they haven't decided. You left these in the courtroom. What are they? They're my verses. Verses? Yeah. About my past. - Would you read them to me? - Hell, no. Ain't gonna happen. You're tripping. Read them to me anyway. Man, you're crazy. My ex-wife would agree with you. - Read them to me. - No. You ain't gonna get it. Read them to me. No, you're not gonna get it. "Counting my... days from the cage. In so many ways it's all that I've known. Cell's been my home. Chaotic environments. I've been growing with violence, still scream..." It's stupid. No, no, it's not stupid. Yeah. I-- Actually I got it right here. Michael, I got Reynolds. He's looking at your notes on the German case. You got a second? Tell him we're busy with this case. He's on his own. - I need you to try-- - I'm gonna have to get back to you. - I can't run it without him. - I... I don't know what to tell you. It's Dad. - Hi. - Hi. Benny gets his leg braces off today, right? Could I speak to him? Sure. - Hello. - Hey, how you feeling? Good. How... how's the case going? Did you win? Well, not yet, it's a tough one. Don't you always win? Not always, no. Well, you should win this one. Well, I'm gonna do my best. Here's Mom. Listen, Kim, you think I could have Ben - for the Thanksgiving weekend? - In Chicago? Yeah, you put him on the plane, I'll pick him up on the other end. It'll be nice, the two of us can hang out. I don't know. Well, will you think about it? Yeah, yeah, I'll think about it. Hello. No, it's fine, I'm... I'm wide awake. Again, I am very sorry to bother you, Sir, but a man left you an urgent package. - Did you see who left it? - No, Sir. Thanks, Sanjay. - Where's Jeff? - I don't know. I... I checked his room and nobody answered. Well, it is 5:30 in the morning. Somebody dropped off a dozen Bellcore documents showing that Joey Poule had a history of violence. He molested his own sister and his niece. - God knows how many other children. - Jesus. I need you to find out who dropped those off. Okay. And, Keisha, thank you. I... I apologize for not being more properly dressed. It's okay, Mr. Trainer. Hello. How? I understand. Mr. Cohen. My name is Keisha. I work with the Trainer Firm. - I would love to talk-- - Sorry, I am very busy. Did you work with Pamela Dupree? Uh, I... I have an appointment. - Uh, I am late. - Mr. Cohen. Did you work with Pamela Dupree? Hi. Hi. How are you? How is the trial going? Uh, it's different. - How? - My client's telling the truth. Oh, wow, that's something different for you, huh. Yeah, it's something. So I... I talked to Benny about Thanksgiving. He said yes. And I want him to go see you. I think it'll be good for both of you. That's great. Tell him I can't wait to see him. - We'll go ride horses in the park. - Horses? Well, don't worry, they're old nags, they don't go very fast. Okay. Just be careful, Michael, he just got those braces off. Of course, yeah. Um... Bye? Bye. Yes. No, I'll be overseas. He wasn't angry. I know. Yeah. Open it. I'll call you back. We took the trouble of calculating how much you stand to gain if this - public offering goes through. - It will go through, Simon. There's no reason to think it won't. Did you know that we are Cal Air's biggest corporate client? I... I did not. You should have. Play harder. We can't lose this. - Jeff, can you check on that? - Yeah. Excuse me. Michael. What is this? Some kind of a joke? I'm afraid not. Come on. Tim, this is Michael Trainer calling. I just received some very alarming news. Could you please call me back? Hey, hey, Dupree. You're behind this, aren't you? What did you say to Cal Air? Cal Air makes its own decisions, Mr. Trainer, and they decided not to work with you anymore. You're a real piece of shit, you know that? Be careful, Mr. Trainer. Cal Air was just the beginning. Give me the Bellcore file. - Sir, the file is-- - What Bellcore file? Your Honor, I'd like to recall Jamal Randolph to the stand. You may proceed. Jamal, I need you to go back on the stand. All you have to do is say yes. I'll do the rest. Michael, what are you doing? Jamal, you were tortured in the Ryan home and their own file shows that, isn't that true? What file? Objection, Your Honor. Your own file shows that they placed Joey Poule - and Randolph-- - Side bar, please. Counselor! ...this previous sexual assault. Counselor! Judge, I have several case notes to show that Bellcore knew that Joey Poule had sexually assaulted other children. I have never seen these documents. Can I see that? Where'd you get this? Someone dropped them off at my hotel. Judge, this is what discovery is for. Without any... any foundation how do we establish the authenticity of these documents? How do we know Mr. Trainer didn't create these documents himself? - That's bullshit. - It's enough. He has no witness to lay a foundation. How do you know? I'm making a really good guess. Do you? - No, not yet. - You can be damn sure unless you can find the person who can authenticate this document, it's not going in. Ms. Dupree, you were Jamal Randolph and Joey Poule's caseworker for four years and you're telling the jury that you had no knowledge that Joey Poule sexually assaulted Jamal Randolph? - Objection, Your Honor. - Sustained. Counsel, you've asked the same question three straight times. Move on. Apparently, putting your hand on the Bible and taking the oath means nothing. What was that you said, Counselor? Nothing, Your Honor. I'd like to show you what's been marked as exhibit number 23. Objection, Your Honor. If this document is not already familiar to the witness, then there is no foundation for its introduction. Take it down. I'm showing you a copy of a mental health record that shows that Joey Poule raped his own sister and cousin. - Objection, Your Honor. - Sustained. Counselor, show that document to Ms. Dupree and see if she recognizes it first. You recognize that document? Never saw it before, Counselor. The jury is instructed to disregard it. Move on. Ms. Dupree, - did you know Joey Poule raped his sister? - No, I did not. - Did you know that he raped his cousin? - I never knew. Did you know that he beat and raped Jamal Randolph? Never knew any of it, Counselor. Okay, ladies and gentlemen, it's time for our Thanksgiving break. And the jury is instructed not to discuss this case or to read about it. All rise. - She's lying. - I know she is. We should take their last offer. And why would we do that? We can't introduce a damn thing. I know they'd settle this right now. No, we're playing the game. There's your answer. I'm, uh... I'm gonna grab a flight out. - What? - It's, uh... it's Thanksgiving weekend, right? Right. But you be back Saturday. You're not coming back, are you? When Michael found out about Cal Air, you weren't surprised. You knew. I'm leaving. I'm starting my own firm. - With no clients. - Cal Air is going with him. Is that true? Ten years and this is what it comes to? You had your day, Michael. You're making a fool of yourself in that courtroom, isn't that obvious? Dupree got to you, didn't she? That's what they do, Jeff. No loyalty. People like Dupree go to Cal Air and make deals and people like you accept them. For 10 years I watched you get rich off of companies like Bellcore destroying anyone who got in your way and now, all of a sudden, you have a change of heart. You think defending that kid makes you some kind of savior? You should have settled. Happy Thanksgiving. Please, leave a message. Kim, it's Michael. I've called, left a couple of messages. I haven't heard back. I still don't have Benny's flight information. Can you please call me? Mr. Trainer, I've just received an urgent message from your wife. That's weird. Why... why wouldn't she have called my cell? She said she couldn't get through to your mobile phone. She wanted me to let you know that your son's changed his mind. He won't make it for Thanksgiving. Yeah. Sorry, Sir. Thanks. ? I lied to mother ? ? Protecting him though He stuck... ? - It's good to have you back, son. - Thanks, pa. ? Snow mounted up To the kitchen window ? ? Oh, oh, oh ? ?

You think it was Bellcore. Could have been an accident. I think it was a warning. Mr. Cohen, we need to speak to you. I know you're the one that dropped those documents off at my hotel. I need you to testify. You have no idea what these people are capable of. Do you remember Jamal? - Hey, Mr. Cohen. - I want you to look at this young man's face and tell him that you are not going to help him. I never wanted you to get hurt. I never wanted any of them to get hurt. But we did. The more placements that fail, the more money that Bellcore makes, okay? Wait, how did they fail? Let's say that the government pays 3000 bucks per foster care placement, but it doesn't work out. So then, Bellcore places the kid again and they make another 3000 bucks. The whole system is designed to fail. Mr. Cohen, I need you to tell this to the jury. I can't. Mr. Cohen. What are you laughing at? You know, sometimes this shit is so thick that the only thing you can do is laugh, Mr. Trainer. It's not funny. We're gonna lose. No, we're not. - It's okay. - No, it's not okay. No, it is. You fought for me and that means something. It's not okay. Is there something else on your mind? No, nothing. My son was supposed to fly in from Los Angeles today and he cancelled, all right? It's really tough. Sorry. Yeah. Well, it's my own fault. I haven't been the best father. How old is your son? Ten. Then you're not done being a father. ? Your loyalty is priceless ? ?

Why you set me up? - Jamal. - Just do what they say. Son, just do what they say. 712? Okay. Yes, okay. Thank you. Mr. Trainer the airline did confirm that your son was on the flight this morning. - No. - They phoned you six times, you didn't answer. - They jammed my phone. - Sir, who jammed your phone? It doesn't matter. Where is my son? - He would have been picked up by the police. - What precinct? The eighth district station will be the closest. 10-4 he's on his way to you. Hands on the bar. Hands on the bars. Guard. Guard. How you doing? Long time no see. How long has it been, ten years or so? Step back, Joey. Huh, a decade's a long time. What you got here? Put my shit down. Yeah, well, I'm betting you... Shit happens. Right, little bro? Nah, you need to step back, Joey. I'm not a kid anymore. I just want to say "hi" to my little brother. That's all. You got tall, but you are still a pussy. We had a good time, me and you in that barn, right? I know you liked it. You like this, huh, big bro? I'm gonna fucking kill you, Joey! I was a fucking kid. I was a kid. Fuck you, you... Fuck! What the fuck are you looking at, huh? You're lucky. I'm not lucky. I'm not lucky. You're lucky you showed up when you did. Children Services was held up, but your son was about to be placed into emergency-- But where is he? Where's my son? - Mr. Trainer. - Dad. Benny. Oh! Oh! Randolph, move back. You got a visitor. Put your shoes on. How did Joey Poule end up in my cell, huh? How the fuck should I know? I think you fucking know. I don't give a fuck what you think. Move back. Let go of my fucking arm. They try and run you over again? They, uh... they took my son. Oh, shit! He all right? Yeah. He's fine. We've been bringing a knife to a gunfight. It's time to even the odds, straighten this shit out a little bit. How much you got in your wallet? What? Sit down. How much? I don't know, maybe a thousand, more. I don't know. Jesus Christ. Oh, yes. - Give it to me. - What are you gonna do with it? Sometimes we gotta do things a little different in my world and you're in my world now. I came here to bail you out. I don't want to get bailed out yet. I got work to do. Send Keisha to bail me out tomorrow. Mr. Trainer, you take care of your boy, all right? I got this. Guard! Don't look so mad, all right? It don't suit you. I know I got it right. You're still awake? Who are these people? What are they capable of? I, honestly, don't know. Are you safe? Oh, yeah. But I don't think it's safe for you and Benny. I think you should go back to Los Angeles. I need 15 minutes like we talked about, all right? Disappear. ? I can't breathe... ? Have a seat. Have a seat. Relax, relax. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! - Chill, just relax. We're cool for now. What the fuck is this? Shut that, D. Hey, guard. Would you do something? Hey, guard! Hey, guard! How much they paying you, Joey? ? I can't breathe... ? I don't know what the fuck you're talking about. I think you do know what I'm talking about. - No. - I'm not stupid. No. I don't know what you are talking about. - Fuck you! - Hey, hey, hey, chill, chill, chill, chill, chill, chill, chill. It's okay, man. I got it. ? I can't breathe... ? Have a seat. Let's try this again. I need you to tell me names. I need you to tell me who got to you. Tell me what you know about the pigs who arrested me and how I ended up in jail with you? Talk, Joey! - Yo. - Hey. Thanks for bailing me out. Not a problem. You ready? Uh, there's something I gotta do. - What do you mean? We have court. - I know, but it's important. Okay. Mr. Cohen. Hey, I'm not going anywhere, all right? Come on, man. Open up. Hi. Cop gave me 2k. Said he needed me to be in jail here with you. I rough you up, cut you, if I needed to. - Why? - I don't know why. I don't know why. I didn't have much of a choice, dude. I mean they got me on some drummed-up shit. - I don't know why. - What happened? Man, I just told you what happened. What happened to you, Joey? The same shit that always happens to guys like you and me. That is not my fault. Your Honor, may I approach? Your Honor, my client has several notebooks. I'd like him to be able to use them to refresh his recollection. I object, Your Honor. They have never been produced in discovery. Your Honor, a witness can use notes to refresh recollections. - I'll allow it. - Thank you. Your Honor, there is one more thing, my client will need to rap his testimony. I'm sorry, excuse me. Did you say "rap"? - Are you serious, Counselor? - Uh, well, First Amendment, right to testify. If the only way my client can tell his story is through rapping - then you cannot deny him. - Uh, Your Honor, he has cited no case law or precedent. Your Honor, the Americans with Disabilities Act, require court to accommodate a witness if he or she has difficulty communicating. No such difficulty has ever been established in this case, Your Honor. In the case of United States versus Durant, the witness suffered from PTSD and had a comfort animal, a dog. Okay, okay, a notebook is not a dog and this plaintiff is not disabled. Here are a line of cases where the court allowed for interpreters or even allowed a woman to speak while holding her child. - This is absurd, Your Honor. - And in the case of Michaels versus Donnelly, the court allowed a man afraid of crowds to face the wall while testifying. I'll allow it. Thank you. Don't overstep your balance, Counselor. Are you ready? This motherfucker's itching to tase me again, man. I know it. You'll be fine. The plaintiff recalls Jamal Randolph to the stand. Note my continuing objection. Your continuing objection noted, now continue to sit down. Jamal, you write, don't you? Yeah. - Lyrics, poems... - Verses. I write verses. Verses, yes, I'm sorry. Uh, verses about what happened to you and you keep them in those notebooks, is that correct? - Yeah. - Now, I'm going to ask you some questions. You don't have to look at anybody. You don't have to look at the jury. You don't have to look at me. Just tell us what happened. Okay? "By age eight a cruel fate, found a meaning and lost it. Ripped from the comfort of a family and taken by cops, the foster boy, a broken toy, a plaything, now a victim going through revolving doors of a foster care system. No, mama. Why, mama? Now, you ain't my real mama, you my high mama. All I wanted was a hug and a hi, mama. Take your fucking hands from my thigh, mama. Flame of a lighter, Stephanie Myers, cigarette and Guinness-style crack pipe hanging from my mouth spent all-nighters, watching talk shows all alone on the couch. Hide and seek, ain't a game if I'm screaming ouch! 'Cause if she takes a hit, then I'm taking hits. I'm hoping she quits 'cause I can't take this shit." You want a break? No, no, no break. I'm cool. Okay. Jamal, I'm gonna ask you about the Ryan family. Can you tell us about the Ryans? Yeah. I ain't never gonna forget the Ryans. "I'm afraid of what I turned into. Ain't what it's supposed to..." You pissed the bed again? "All I see are walls, no room at all." - Why do you lie to me? - Let go of me. "So, where do I go to? No one loves a bastard like the misery he's prone to. - Better days..." - Drink it. - "And little care..." - Drink it! "Misfortune always finds me there. No matter where, it's always near me. They only want me for a check, check, can you hear me? Ryan watched. I peed the bed. He flipped the switch. Kicked my crotch. Ripped and beat me. Trick and treat me. That's who I had to call 'pops'. Pop goes the lid off the vinegar jar. Pop me in the jaw, now I'm seeing stars. It's hard. It's hard. I'm sorry, Jamal, but... we need to talk about the Randolphs. Can you tell us what happened at the Randolph home? Joey Poule... raped me for three years. It started when I was ten. Did you ever tell anyone, Jamal? - Her. - Pamela Dupree. And what did she say to you when you told her, Jamal? She said... that I was lucky to have a home. Mr. Randolph, I was moved by the songs that you rapped to us during your direct testimony, but they were just that. Am I right? Songs. I... I'm... I'm sorry. I'm sorry, verses. - They're the truth. - Okay, okay. So you say. So, is there anyone else in the courtroom here today who can verify your truth for us? Anyone at all? No one, not Ms. Ryan, no other foster parents, not even any kids from the neighborhood, there's nobody here, to sing the same tune as you. Isn't that right? - It's the truth. - The truth, the songs that you wrote down in these notebooks? Yeah, I wrote the songs. Okay, are the songs that you shared with us today the only songs that are inside the books? - No. - Well, what other kinds of songs have you written? Uh, I don't know, a lot of stuff. I mean have you ever written any songs about say, um, I don't know, places that you've never been or, uh, romances you never actually had sexual experiences you wished you had? - No. - No, nothing from your imagination? - No. - So, I want you to be careful here, Mr. Randolph, you're telling the court here today that if we look through these books, which we can do, which we will do, that we will not find a single song that you made up. That everything inside these notebooks, there must be what? Uh, uh, a hundred or more and that every one of them is a true factual account of something that actually happened to you? - On some of the songs, yeah, but not... not all of them. - Fair enough. Some of them are real and some of them are made up, but how can we know the difference? I'm... I'm telling you the difference. Oh, oh, I see. Okay, so there is actually no evidence whatsoever that any of these so-called rapes even happened except for what you wrote down yourself inside these books that you've just admitted are also filled with things that you sometimes make up from your imagination? Yeah. Thanks for clearing that up. Mr. Trainer, are you ready for closing arguments? Yes, Your Honor. If it may please the court, council members of the jury... Uh, Your Honor, I'd like to call Daniel Cohen to the stand, if I may? You got to be kidding me. - Come on up, Mr. Cohen. - Your Honor, this witness appears on no witness list. We have no opportunity to prepare. Overruled. Step up, Mr. Cohen. Do you swear to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God? I do. State your name for the record. - Daniel Cohen. - Daniel Cohen, can you tell the jury what you do for a living? A social worker. How many years were you a social worker? - Fifteen. - Could you tell the jury what your relationship is to Ms. Pamela Dupree? We work together at Bellcore Family Services. Mr. Cohen, I'm showing you what has been marked as exhibit number 23. Famous Exhibit 23. Your Honor, I object. Give it up, Mr. Collins. - Do you recognize this document? - I do. Mr. Cohen, what exactly is this? - It's a... a violent incident form. - A violent incident form And what does the violent incident form show? It shows that Joey Poule raped his sister, put a knife up to another boy and sexually assaulted another four-year-old child while at a residential treatment facility just six months before Pamela Dupree placed him with the Randolphs. Mr. Cohen, where is it that you found this document? I saw Ms. Dupree throw it in the garbage... ...and I took it out. That's true, isn't it, Mrs. Dupree? You threw it in the trash because you knew that Joey Poule had a history of sexual violence. - Isn't that true? - Objection, Your Honor. Ms. Dupree is not on the witness stand. She's already under oath, it doesn't matter what chair she sits in. Answer the question, Ms. Dupree. Isn't it true that Bellcore Family Services paid you bonuses that you personally received money for each child you placed in a foster home? Isn't that true, Ms. Dupree? All right, um, on the advice of my counsel, I am going to exercise my Fifth Amendment right. Your Honor, the plaintiff would like to amend the request and ask for punitive damages. Your Honor, the defense asserts that punitive damages are not called for in this case. Mr. Trainer, your motion is granted. If it may please the court, counsel, members of the jury. I didn't want this case. I didn't want this case because when I looked at Jamal, I saw a thug, a freeloader, a tax on our system. Sometimes when we meet people, we don't see them for who they truly are. I'm sorry that I did not see you, Jamal. Over the course of this trial I've gotten to know Jamal Randolph, the 19-year-old boy who sits before you today. But I ask you to go back in time now, to see Jamal as a 10-year-old boy forced to live in 12 different foster homes, but, eventually, he found the right home, the home of Shaina and Bill Randolph, who later adopted him. They also fostered Joey Poule. Now what Jamal and the Randolphs didn't know, what they couldn't know was that Joey Poule had a severely violent past, a history of rape. The reason Jamal and the Randolphs didn't know was because Pamela Dupree and Bellcore Family Services tried to destroy those records. I'm sorry that Bellcore did this to you, Jamal, and I can see now why it's difficult for you to trust anyone. But I'm asking you to... I'm begging you, please put your trust in this jury. The same way that your mother gave you hope by wrapping her loving arms around you, this jury will give you hope by wrapping the American Constitution around you. This is your opportunity to give Jamal and kids like him, hope. Hope that what we do in this courtroom and courtrooms like this all across the country will never let them down again. I thought you'd be on a flight back to Los Angeles. When was the last time I listened to you? Good point. Some hot cocoa for you, bud. Jury's back. Have you reached a verdict? We have, Your Honor. In the manner of Jamal Randolph versus Bellcore Family Services, we the jury, find the defendants, guilty of deliberate indifference to the rights of Jamal Randolph and we assess damages of thirty-two million, six hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Matter is concluded, court is adjourned, jury is dismissed. Ms. Dupree, Ms. Dupree, Agent Stockton with the FBI. We received some information this morning. We have some questions for you. No, uh, I... Yeah. How much? No. We'll wait a month, it'll die down then we'll go public. Yeah. Hey, Mr. Trainer. What you said in there... sometimes when you meet a person you don't really see them for who they are. It's true. Thanks for everything. Three-piece. Thug! Good luck, Mr. Randolph. ?
