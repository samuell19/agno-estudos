Welcome to Gray Bear's channel. That's right, it's a special day. We are going to experience the most famous urban legend in central Taiwan, -Chair Maiden. -Yes. Do you know who Chair Maiden was? She was tortured to death 100 years ago by her aunt and became a spirit. She can answer everything you ask accurately. Have you heard? That's right. So, we are here to experience this infamous urban legend. So, we spent a lot of money and hired this psychic girl. Hot psychic, Chia-min. Chia-min, introduce yourself. May you not go to the heavens nor to the earth. May you not go to the heavens nor to the earth. Okay, Chia-min, can you tell us directly how to start with Chair Maiden? Chair Maiden, we summon you to come and sit with us. Sit up tight. Sit up right. Come and sit up right. Knock three times to come and sit with us. Is she here yet? Hey, what is going on now? Should we continue to stream? Yes, continue. Oh my God, are you seeing this? We really have invited Chair Maiden here. What do you want to ask Chair Maiden? Chair Maiden. Why did your aunt want to kill you? Hey, what kind of question is that? Hey, what is going on now? Why is it spinning? Did you all see that? This is definitely not a setup. Damn, she is possessed. Shit. Where are you going? Wow, did you all see that? That was crazy cool. What exactly happened? Mister, you… You spoiled brats. Of all things, you mess with Chair Maiden? Damn. Sir, can you explain what just happened? -Stop filming. -Damn. Why did you push my camera? You can tell me without violence. Are you okay? Okay, that's tonight's video. I believe you have all enjoyed this supernatural livestream on my channel. That's right. So please support me by subscribing to my channel. Do all you can do. We'll meet next time, bye. Why are you following me? Here. You dropped this. Are you a Taoist Master? Can you help me? I want to be a normal person. I can see those things. CHIEN-CHIEN: WHERE ARE YOU? LET'S GO. MISSED CALLS FROM AUNT, 13 You are looking at the wrong person. Go home now. Aunt, why are you not sleeping yet? Your uncle is out. And none of you are back, I can't sleep. I worked a late shift today. Work… Are you hungry? Let me reheat the food for you. -I made a lot today. -It's okay. I already ate at work. I'm not hungry. You always work so hard. Are you eating properly? Yes, I am. I am going to my room now. Yes, go to sleep. Go to sleep quickly. No one is eating all these dishes. What a waste. Chen Yu-lan, why do you never learn? What a waste! CHANGHUA MEDICAL UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL PATIENT: CHEN YU-LAN SYMPTOMS: PSYCHOTIC SYMPTOMS, NAUSEA, VOMITING We purposely came here from Taipei. Can your high school friend be trusted? I heard that her parents' deaths were caused by an evil spirit. -Evil spirit? -Keep your voice down. She was the one who drew the evil spirit to them. Later, she was sent to live with her aunt. But do you know? Her uncle beats her every day. She's quite pitiful. She also has no friends. This is all I can do for you. This is all I can do for you, for now. What is that? Oh my God! Shit! Help! -What's going on? What happened? -Why is he kneeling? -Hung to death… -Yes, what happened here? Isn't this Chang-tsai? What's going on? Taoist Master. Why can't he lie down? Down! -Hey! -Hey, he's down already. Wait, let me grab his feet. Here. A little bit lower. Master, how do we lift this curse? The Rope Ritual? You two. You have touched this body. This body is cursed. -This amulet is for you. -Okay. -Dissolve it in water and bathe in it. -Okay. Last time, I was hurt while performing the ritual. -And now… -Here, one for 50 dollars. -I can no longer perform the ritual now. -Don't worry. But only you can perform it here. We can pay you a lot so you can take care of your body. No, I can't. Uncle. Don't reject it right away. Let's see how much the mayor is offering. All you care about is the money. Then you can perform the ritual. I don't want to die yet. So what else can we do here? Uncle, what are we doing here? Who is it? It's you. Come in. I wouldn't be here if I didn't need your help. We need you to perform the Zhong Kui Dance tomorrow night for purification. I can't perform the Zhong Kui Dance the way I am now. Suicide is even easier. Remember the evil spirit we encountered five years ago? The rope we are going to purify this time has the same evil scent. You know how powerful this spirit is. If we don't get rid of it quickly, one after another, we don't know how many people will die. Do you want me to kneel and beg? Despite what my uncle has said, you're not going to do it? Uncle, are you okay? I really don't want to bring it up again. About how our master had died. If you're not helping others, what heavenly mandate have you got? Who the hell is he? Uncle. I don't need help, I am not dead yet. Rubbish! Rubbish! Ms. Chen Yu-lan, did your husband have depression? Can you let me talk to him alone? Get up. Get up! Don't you like to hit me? Get up. Get up and hit me. I am telling you to get up and hit me! Get up and hit me! Get up. Get up. Get up! Changhua District's Prosecutor, Tsai Mai-ta, cracked a large-scale drug smuggling case again recently. This is already his third drug smuggling case this year. Our team is outstanding. We've been investigating since August. Once we confirmed the suspect's movements in and out of the factory, we started planning to deploy. Thankfully, everything went smoothly. We didn't have any casualties. Mr. Tsai Mai-ta also mentioned that the commander this time… CHIEN-CHIEN: THE VIDEO HAS BEEN UPLOADED. ARE YOU FREE TONIGHT FOR ANOTHER VIDEO? Where is Uncle? Aunt, is that you? It's okay. It's okay. Don't be afraid. It's okay. Let's not be afraid. He will no longer bother us. Don't be afraid. Good girl. They said they will bury your uncle tomorrow. We should pay our last respects to him tomorrow morning. Then stay home at night and don't go out. Here you are. Come pay your respects to him quickly. Come in now. Afterward, I'll give you amulets to put up at home. As you are family members, remember not to go out at night. How should I put up the amulet? Put it above the doors and windows. Also, put a broom upside down outside the door. Okay. You told me I was born with a heavenly mandate. But now my master is dead, I can't help you and I can't help anyone either. I can't even take care of myself. How can I help others? You can do it yourself. Jerry, get inside now. What are you doing? Get in now. Hurry up. Stop playing ball. Get in now. Hurry up. What is the view count now? The view count? Maybe because it was uploaded for a day only. -Just 140,000. -140,000? Gray Bear, let's get out of here, okay? Look, I think they are performing the Rope Ritual. There is even a route map. Uncle, it is about time. Uncle! What are you doing? Why are we turning around? I have decided that if my livestreamed Chair Maiden can't beat him, I doubt I'll still lose with the same scene. I don't want to keep filming. It's too scary. The train station is just up ahead. Get out if you don't want to film. Did you not hear me? Get out! Fine, I will go. You are really driving away? Go to hell! You bastard! Are you okay? You should sit down. Uncle. Zhong Kui is not helping you anymore. Just stop holding on now. What are you doing here? Recording, traditional folklore recording. Okay, so we have found a particular secret lane. I think this lane is suitable for this particular night. Everyone, do you see this? All the windows have this on. I don't know what kind of amulets these are. I hope people are more ethical now. Make sure it is all recycled, okay? I told you not to touch my stuff. Can't you listen? This is from Thailand. I told you not to touch it. You keep messing with my stuff. What are you doing? Don't touch my stuff! Uncle, please stop hitting her! Aunt, anything I can help with? Let's move to Taipei together, okay? I have saved up some money. We can rent a house there and find a job. I don't know. I don't know. I'm now-- I don't know what to think. I don't know. Now, this is not important. I'm sorry I caused this. Don't talk nonsense there. When I was little, I dreamed about my parents. Then, they died from a car accident. A few days ago, I also dreamed about Uncle. It was just a coincidence with your parents. Your uncle deserved this. You know he did a lot of bad things. If he did not adopt you, he would have died already. He would have died already. After your mom died, you're my only family. And I still let you endure all these pains. I am useless. Aunt, don't be like this. I am useless. I can't do anything right. No. I can't do anything right. No. Why? It's my fault. It's really not. I caused you pain. I did! -I did. -No, don't act like this. -I don't know what to do. -No. I don't know. I don't know. Aunt, where are you going? Where are you going? Aunt! Aunt, you can't go there. Don't go over there. The hot psychic? Wait! Wait! There's still something not sent away. There's still something not sent away. Wait! There's still something not sent… This is nice. Family members can't be here. Something bad will happen. There is still something not sent away. Who are you? You can't film here. -So? -Go away. -Why can you but not me? -I'm recording tradition. -Don't you know me? I'm Gray-- -Your name can't be said out loud! Hey! -Don't you know? Bad things will happen. -Don't touch me. -Aunt, what's wrong? -Go away! This is great. Everyone, someone is definitely possessed. Wow, how did I come across this again? Heavenly Fire. Wow, super cool! Thank you. Let's go. You two can't leave. Once you're in the ritual, you can't leave. For anything that's not sent away, we'll deal with it later. Keep up. Let's go. Don't move! -What's going on? Don't move! -That's it, don't move! -Don't move! -Don't move! Stop. Everyone, stop moving. Something is not right. -Back up. -Back up a little. -Make way! -Make way! Hey. That's evidence. You can't throw it away. Who is responsible here? I am Tsai Mai-ta, the prosecutor of the first investigation team. This is important evidence of a drug smuggling case. You can't throw it away! That rope is cursed. The ritual is necessary. I don't care about the curse. All I know is that's evidence. You are stealing the evidence. Go get it back. -What are you doing? -What are you doing? Aunt, what are you looking at? Stop moving or I will shoot! Oh no, I'd better go. No! Don't come near me! What a scam. Take them all to the police station. -Yes! Let's go! -Come. -Yes. -Let's go quickly! No, don't let it take me. Please don't. Do you know why Chen Yu-lan joined the ritual? I'm not so sure. Aunt was sorting out my uncle's stuff at that time. She found something that was not sent away. -That's why she ran after them. -Wait, take the bag inside. We were performing the ritual. What if something goes wrong because you suddenly came in? It's weird. We were hired by them. Now, this happened. What are we to do? Yes, the Rope Ritual. You're also aware of that. It has a time limit. We weren't done when you cut in. Bad things will happen. You can't meddle. -Don't you know? -Tell the mayor to come out. Or are you taking the blame? You have been a Taoist Master so long. Have you encountered anything like this? Now, the curse remains. What should we do? Why didn't you ask for Master Xi to come? You two can go now. Okay, thanks. -Hey, what about us? -You can't go yet. Why can't we go? -Why can't we go? -I told you no. Shut up. Hey, bathe her with the amulet water. What? Just do as I said. Thank you. Let's go. Mayor. Hey, so should I wait for you to bail them out? Okay. Yes, I am here. Okay. The rope? Let me grasp the situation first. We'll talk later. Aunt, stop rubbing your eyes. It will hurt your eyes. Let me wipe your face for you. Aunt, what's wrong? What did you wipe my face with? Amulet water. Why would you hurt me with this? Aunt, don't act like this. Aunt, you are scaring me. I'm going to kill you! Your mom is suffering in hell. You are alive and happy here. Come here! Aunt! Aunt! Aunt! Aunt! Open the door, Aunt! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door. I'm hanging up. Hey! Wait! You just got bailed out. Why are you knocking on people's doors? Back off. Do you want to go to the police station again? -Please excuse us. That… -Where is your aunt? She is in the room. Please save her. What is going on? Where's this place? She is in here. Hey, curse or no curse. Why are we here? You idiot. The curse has transferred here now. Put the amulet on. That will cost you 50 dollars. Aunt, don't do that! Please don't! I am in pain. Help me. Aunt! Come and help! Press her legs down! Hurry! That is too high. This is to ward off spirits. Watch the fire. Don't let them extinguish. Okay. I need one more thing. What is that? Alcohol. Do you have any alcohol in your house? I have put them up everywhere outside. You drunken bastard. You incompetent bastard. You're hiding here drinking again. Let's go! Shut up. Go put up the amulets. You will need to pay for the cost of these amulets. Where did this come from? She drew these. She started drawing after she came home. Does she often try to commit suicide? My uncle thinks that I bring bad luck. So he would often hit my aunt and me. Keep meddling with my stuff all day. What the hell are you doing? Don't hit me! Don't hit me anymore! I'm sorry, I will not do it again! I told you not to touch my stuff. Don't touch. Then, she became sick. That is not sickness. Her body and soul are weak. Then, she was in that Rope Ritual. Now her soul is damaged and almost disappearing. Is there any way to save her? I beg you, please. My aunt is the only family I have left. I can kneel. -I can bow down. -I don't need that. Get up. -Please! -Hey, what's the use of you kneeling? Do you have money to pay for what we have used? I have the money. It's not about the money. Then, give it to me. Unless your aunt dies or passes the curse to another person, there might be another way. What way? Please help me save my aunt. I am begging you. I can teach you a method, but things that you don't want to see will follow you and entangle you. Are you willing to accept that? I am. Here are the clothes. What's next? Take the clothes and this fabric. Tie them on that bamboo stick. Then bring this red thread into the house. This is to summon the spirit. This is the protection charm. Memorize them all at once. Cross the ring fingers. Press down the middle fingers. Then, cross both thumbs. Urgently go as the law. Urgently go as the law. Not bad. Here is the chair. Thread the line through the chair. Then, tie it on her left arm. Chair Maiden will protect you. Chair Maiden? I've asked her to protect you three times. Aunt! One more thing. If someone calls you, don't ever turn your head around. Tie it up securely. One for being cleared. Second for being bright. Third, to call for Chen Yu-lan's soul. All souls return now. Urgently go as the law. Hey. What was that you were teaching her? Is it working? It depends on her destiny. We can't help her. What the hell? So much work to just get rid of the curse. Does she really have the money to pay for this? Where are we going now? Can you answer my question? You are so annoying. Go ask the mayor if the evil spirit is back yet. Aunt. Aunt. Where are you, Aunt? All charms protect my body. All charms protect me. All charms protect my soul. Urgently go as the law. Dad! Mom! Dad! Mom! Where are both of you? I really, really miss you two. Come out, please! Aunt. Aunt! Aunt! Aunt, let's just go home, okay? Aunt, don't draw anymore. Aunt, let's just go home now. Aunt, don't draw anymore. Hurry and go home with me now. Chia-min. Chia-min. Why are you leaving so soon? Dad and Mom are feeling cold. We can't hold on anymore. Chia-min, save us! Why is this happening? Aunt. Aunt. Are you okay now? Who is she? What's wrong? Who is she? She is you. Who is she? Who? Who is she? Who? Don't! No! You can't do this! No! Let it go! Zhongnan Mountains Master, Zhong Kui, is here. All you sentient beings. All those grievances flow with the water and never come back. When we performed the Rope Ritual, someone got possessed. She drew this. Take a look. Did you move that feng shui tree? We have to be alert. I have a feeling that the evil spirit is looking for an opportunity to come out. Then, will our master ever forgive me? I told you before. It was not your fault. You were trying to save me and at that moment, what you saw was not our master. You carry the heavenly mandate. Master loved you the most. How can he not forgive you? I recently met a girl with a heavenly mandate like me. I'm not sure if it's a coincidence. Blessed or cursed. It's only a fine line. I have to warn you. For people with this supernatural ability, if possessed, that would be a catastrophe. -What happened? -Her neck was cut by glass pieces. Quick! Emergency patient. Quick! Quickly, this way! Come and help. -What happened? -Her neck was cut by… Miss, please leave. Please wait outside. -Okay, one, two, three. -We need a blood transfusion now, -Four units. -What happened to your aunt? I couldn't bring her soul back. Once I woke up, she started to stab herself with glass. Help! Give me the tranquilizer! It's all your fault! -It's you! -Miss, please calm down. -It's all your fault! -Please calm down. Miss, please leave and let the patient calm down. -Calm down. -Get out! Miss, please calm down. It's not my fault. It's not my fault. Your aunt is just being delusional. Don't take it personally. Now, the problem is here. Are we going to be afraid for a lifetime or are we going to face it bravely? You need to cherish yourself. Damn, what did I say wrong? But I am really tired. What are you doing? I am doing the Zhong Kui Dance. When I was little, I would follow the people in the temple. When they performed the Zhong Kui Dance, I was just so happy. When I was little, every time… When I was afraid, I would close my eyes. But I could still feel that there was no way to hide. Let me tell you. You only have two choices. One is to fear for the rest of your life. The other one is to face it bravely. Pick whichever you want. Why is it me? Open your spiritual eye. See your heavenly mandate. From now on, you have the spirit of Zhong Kui. Damn, which gang was so bold to dare kill my underling? What is this? May you not go to the heavens nor to the earth. 1.5 million. What is this? Come! What's wrong? Something happened. Hurry! This tree can't be moved! Something bad will happen. Don't move this tree! What are you doing? Get down at once. -Taoist Master! -Get down now. You have performed the Rope Ritual, but people still commit suicide here. -What can we do? -Something bad will happen. Your Rope Ritual messed things up. Aren't you responsible? My uncle also said the same thing. -There must be a reason. -No. -Don't move it! -I don't care. Get him out of here. -Continue. -Calm down! Dig! Something bad will happen. Why are there snakes here? Let me take care of it. Be careful. Mayor, look, there is something over there. Why is there a wooden box here? -It's covered by amulets. -Dig it out and see. Don't ever open the wooden box. -Why? -What are you doing? Don't open it. It's cursed! I don't believe a word you said. Put it down. Put it down now! Why is there a snake? -What's that? -Snake! Put that down! -What is this? -That is Thailand's most powerful demon. The Thai Demon! Anyway, stop talking rubbish. Find the Thai Demon quickly. -Master! -Master! Master! Master! Master! Seven people. Could it be the number of people who were hanged to death? People with supernatural power… People with a supernatural power like Yen-huo. Bad luck. Nightmares. Ominous signs. Together with the spirits from seven suicides. Gather upon a person with supernatural powers. Then it can be reborn. So that means the statue wants to incarnate in human form. To be reborn into the world. It wants to be born as a human being! YEN-HUO, I'VE TRANSLATED THE THAI AMULET YOU GAVE ME. -Really? -Are we in danger? -Yes, what should we do? -What should we do now? -Go home and bathe in amulet water. -Is this okay? -Don't come out at night. -What now? -Where are you going? -I'm going to the hospital. To the hospital? Hey! -Amulet. -Amulet. -Amulet. -Don't… -Amulet… -Don't pull, don't grab! -Amulet… -Here, you can have it. That is my bike. Hey! Aunt? Excuse me. Where did the patient on that bed go? Where's the patient on bed six? -Her family member was just here. -I'll take a look outside. Hey! Are you still in pain? The doctor should be here soon. Breathe. Have a sip of water. What were you trying to do? Tell me now. Tell me now! Where are you going? Hey! Kuo-tsai. Bad luck. Nightmares. All ominous signs. Also, with the spirits of seven suicides as the sacrifice and all the suicide spirits gather onto the person with supernatural powers, the statue will turn into human form. It will be incarnated into a human being. -Aunt! -So, even though the curse can be sent away, we still have to be careful. Come to me. I am Chung Yen-huo! I dare you to take me instead! Don't go after her. I am Chung Yen-huo! I dare you to take me! Damn, are you crazy? Why are you shouting your name? Back off, it's none of your business. -I still want to live even if you don't. -I am Chung Yen-huo. Take me! This is a setup from the Thai Demon. It wants Chia-min. What Thai Demon? What setup? Chung Yen-huo! Wait for me! Chia-min… Chia-min… Chia-min… Aunt! Why did you come to such a place? Can't we just go home now? Aunt! Hey… I… I really… I really can't. I can't run anymore. I am going to die from running. Hey… Hey! Hey! Aunt… Are you here? Aunt… Hey! It looks scary over there. Hey! What exactly is this place? What are we doing here? Hey, wait for me! Where is this? Where exactly is this place? Kuai, hurry! Hurry up! Hurry! She's still breathing. I'll call the police. What is that thing? -It is coming. -Who is coming? The Thai Demon. I'm sorry, I'm a good guy. I have nothing to do with this. I am just passing by. Zhongnan Mountains, hear me out. Burning incense for your coming. Your disciple sincerely requests, Heavenly Master Zhong Kui, come at once. Magical armies, urgently as the law! There's still something not sent away. Wait! There's still something not sent… No, don't let it take me. I'm sorry. I'm… Magical armies, urgently as the law! All charms protect my body. All charms protect me. Urgently… as the law! Get the Zhong Kui sword! Hurry, hurry! Dispel evil and bind spirits. Seal my body. Urgently go as the… Why are you doing this? No. Don't. Five… Five Thunder… Five Thunder Rune Necklace. I found it. Put it on yourself. No. It will protect you. No! Don't! I don't want it! Don't! -I want to be a normal person. -You are looking at the wrong person. Are we going to be afraid for a lifetime or are we going to face it bravely? But I am really tired. Things that you don't want to see will follow you and entangle you. Are you willing to accept that? Urgently go as the law. I am Chung Yen-huo! I dare you to take me instead! Don't go after her. I am Chung Yen-huo! I dare you to take me! What are you doing? I am doing the Zhong Kui Dance. You need to cherish yourself. Give them back to me! Wake up. Wake up. No! You are okay, right? Unclean spirits will not be defeated. Nothing can purify evil. Demons and evil will always be with you. May you not go to the heavens nor the earth. Unclean spirits… Don't be afraid. I will be with you. HOSPITAL Aunt. The doctor said you can be released from the hospital soon. Also, I have changed to a new job. What kind of work? It's a job which helps people. Chia-min. Yes?
