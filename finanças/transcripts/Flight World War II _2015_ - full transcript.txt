Ladies and gentlemen, we have just reached our cruising altitude. This is William Strong, your pilot to fly you across the pond. My co-pilot is Daniel Prentice. We're looking at a total flight time of just around seven and a half hours, which will just put us on the ground in London, England right on time. Forecast calls for clear skies so sit back, relax, and enjoy your ride. You didn't get that haircut we talked about after your vacation. It's still within regulations. Barely. Sir, are you doing okay? Okay. Here you go, Sweetie. - Thank you. - Sir, can I get you anything? Oh, another late night, party girl? Oh, shush. Will, all cross checks are done. Been in the air a while. How are you doing? Just a few more hours to Heathrow. Hey, wingman. You're making me nervous. Something up over there? I don't know. Maybe a short somewhere? See? All you need is just a little- Come on, Daniel, disengage your yoke and get it figured out. Gander Center, this is IA 42. We seem to be having some intermittent instrument problems. We're trying to sort them out. IA 42. Understood IA 42. You're looking at clear skies ahead of you in all directions. Let us know if you need assistance. Will do, IA 42. Daniel, I can't fly like this, man. Dammit. We better- Whoa. Gander Center, this is IA 42. I thought you said we had clear skies. You had clear skies five seconds ago, IA 42. It popped up on our screens out of nowhere. Squawk 7700. Do you have any way around this? We're showing it right on top of you. Ladies and gentlemen, please return to your seats. We seem to be having some turbul... Crew, secure the cabin and return to your seats immediately. Shit! Think we can fly around it? I think we'll have to go straight through. Give me a hand. She's rolling. It's night already? Sunset wasn't for another 40 or 50 minutes. We didn't black out or anything, did we? No, nothing like that. Sorry about that everyone. We had a sudden storm pop up there. Good news is we've passed the worst of it. It should be smooth sailing from here on in. You'll notice that while we were going through that storm the sun went down. That will happen sometimes when you cross the tip of the Bermuda Triangle. Don't worry. You'll catch another sunset tomorrow. The tip of the Bermuda Triangle? As good an answer as any. Anyone else's internet connection down? Jesus. You seeing this? I've got altitude, airspeed, fuel, but that's just enough to keep us airborne. Three-quarters of a tank. Looking fine but that's assuming we're still on course. You've got control. Disengaging. Gander Center, this is IA 42. We've gone through the storm but it seems most of our instruments are out requiring assistance. IA 42. Gander Center, this is London-bound IA 42. Do you read me? I'm not getting anything. Fuses are good. I don't know what's going on. - Check the backup system. There has to be something working. - On it. Gander Center, this is IA 42. Do you copy? Still nothing. You? We've got one thing humming along just fine. Thank God for that. What is it? Our radar system. Only thing that wasn't replaced last time they upgraded international airline avionics. As long as that's operational. It's a step in the right direction. How are you guys doing over here? Good, thank you. Thank you. Can I get you something to drink? Sorry. Were you standing there long? No, it's fine. What can I get you? Ginger ale. It got dark early, didn't it? I'm sure it's just because of the storm, like the captain said. Thank you. So, what brings you gentlemen to England? Business or pleasure? Both! We're history professors. Akron University. There's a convention just outside of London. They've discovered some amazing pre-war artifacts and several distinguished members are- You don't have to bore the poor woman. Her eyes are glazing over already. No, it's fine. I just need to finish this side of the plane but I'd love to hear more so I'll come back. I'm going to hold you to that. Get out now, while you still can! Alright, about the Hitler map of Argentina... What are you working on there? Oh me? Just trying to keep track of everything. You see, when you get to my age you have to stay on top of things because, well, you never know when you're going to get another chance. Well, I'll let you get back to it then. Thanks a lot. Huh, that's weird. Have you got some more good news for me? Take a look. There's nothing there. Not a blip. Is the radar malfunctioning too? I thought so at first but the coordinates are moving with us. If this thing were on the fritz it wouldn't be working at all. So we're flying deaf but not completely blind. There should be some air traffic showing up around us. Okay, let's make a loop. Try to find someone or something. Nothing. Bupkis. According to the radar, we're all alone up here. Maybe the storm diverted traffic. We'll wait until those radios come back up. What if it doesn't? We're still a couple of hours away from London. That's assuming we didn't get turned around or blown off course. If we duck under the cloud cover we may be able to find some visual cue from a shipping lane or maybe a message being relayed from a cargo ship. You sure that's the right move? If no one can hear us on the ground. That's the only move we've got. This is Cameron. Hey, Hicks. How's everything going back there? We're all a little rattled but we're fine. Good. I'll be making an announcement. And I want the crew back in their seats when we're making a descent. Is everything okay? Just trying to get away from some of this, uh, high level wind shear. Just get everyone strapped in, okay? Sure. Everything okay? We need to get everyone to their seats. We're making a descent. He says it's to get away from the turbulence. What turbulence? Ladies and gentlemen, we'd like everyone to get back in their seats. We're trying to get away from this turbulence, so we'll be ducking under the clouds for a bit. Pretty routine stuff but we'd like everyone buckled in just in case. All secure back here, Captain. You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Trust me, when you've been doing this as long as I have, you've seen it all. This is nothing. Okay. Land? The Atlantic should be below us. Yes, it should be. Okay, so we got blown off course. Gander Center, do you copy? Keep your eyes open for a radio tower. Blinking lights. Anything. Radar says we've got smaller craft about twenty kilometers away. But they're all bunched up. Are you sure that's aircraft? Never seen anything like that before. I'm not sure of anything but we're closing in on whatever the hell this is. It's too hazy up ahead. Could be another storm. That's not a storm. Looks more like a....fire! Oh my god! Oh god. Jesus Christ! Well, we got something close! Coming in hot on our nine! Daniel, kill the nav lights! Shit! We're a sitting duck out here! Hang on! Watch that radar. Hey, wh-what's going on? What's happening is we're going to get shot down just like those other planes in the Ukraine. As soon as the captain has things under control I am sure he'll inform us as to exac- Hey, I'm just trying to get some answers, okay? As soon as we know what's going on, sir, we'll let you know. What? No! No. We want answers! Sir, let go of me. Sir, if you don't sit down we will have to restrain you. Now sit down! Fine. Strong. Will, what's going on? We're trying to get a handle on this. Is everyone okay back there? Everyone's fine. Just confused and concerned. Let me address the plane. We'll let you know as soon as we can. Just keep everybody calm, okay? Looks like we're clear. Nothing anywhere close. I'm going to keep putting some distance between us and them. In a few minutes we'll try to duck below again, okay? What? Will, that didn't work out so great last time. We also don't know where we are. Without instruments all we've got left are the landmarks and we can't find them from above the clouds. Ladies and gentlemen, our apologies for that scare. We got blown off course a little because of that storm, but we appear to be out of danger. We ask that you all please bear with us and stay calm. The flight crew is here to help. Excuse me, sorry. No, no problem. How can I help? Um, we were actually hoping we could help you. Sorry, gentlemen. I don't have time right now. It'll have to wait. Oh! Captain? It's Cameron. This isn't the best time to ta- Captain, my name is Bennett and this is my colleague, Dale. No! You can't be in the cockpit. Hicks, get them out of here! Roger! Brianna! We need some help! Captain, do you know what sort of aircraft that was back there? I want you guys back in your seats. They were Junkers Ju 88s. A couple Heinkel He 111s. German. I made it very clear! No one's made prop planes like that since 1945! You have to listen to us! There's no way that those planes should still be flying! Gentlemen! You seem to be flying without your instruments, Captain. Are you two in on this?! No, no! Of course not! We can see they're down! We are flying without most of them. Everything that talks to a satellite. The radar's the only thing that's working. Complete signal loss? Almost as if there are no satellites? You have thirty seconds. Is your radio working? We're getting some static but I think that- But you haven't been able to contact anyone since you passed through. Something like that. That's because there weren't many Allied radio towers on the Western front in 1940. Hey. Take it easy. Try to sleep. I can't sleep now. Me neither. That's odd. Based on the coastline. The planes. We believe we just flew through the bombing of Saint Nazaire. June, 1940. Massive German bombing on the west coast of France. I don't have time for this. Get these conspiracy theorists out of here. Alright, come on. Wait! We can help you figure out where we are. If you get back below the clouds again... we do know a little bit about the geography of World War II. Okay, okay! You guys can help out. But get back to your seats now. Of course, Captain. And a lower altitude, you'll be better off picking up weaker frequencies of the '40s. I don't want to hear anything about time travel, Okay? Let's just figure out where we are first. Even though it looks outdated, that radar's still more advanced than anything the Germans are using at this point! Enough. Now go back to your seats. The point is, that radar will keep you one steps ahead if we come across on of those any more planes. Even if you are right, which is a massive, massive if, how do you propose we get back, huh? We look for another weather anomaly. If one of those things brought us here, another one should be able to bring us back. So we look for another storm. Yeah. Crew, would you mind getting them back to their seats, please? Yeah, right now, gentlemen. And hey, all of you, not a word to anyone. Okay? - Okay. - Gentlemen, please. We're having electrical issues. What about the planes? And the bombs? I just don't want anyone to panic, okay? We will handle it. Captain, we'll get through this. I've flown with you a million times. You've never let me down once. We'll be making another controlled descent but there's nothing to worry about. Thank you for your cooperation and patience. I don't see how you can make that leap. Well it makes sense. Look, it's logical... And when exactly did you get your physics degree, professor? Oh shut up, I'm telling you it's going to work. It's not. You can't know that. Okay. Can I help you, sir? What did the captain say? You heard him. We're moving to a lower altitude to assess the situation. Okay... but what's going on? I assure you, sir, you'll know when everyone else does. Now please let go of my arm. Thank you. I promise, if you touch me again, you're going to have an entirely different set of problems to deal with. Okay, if we can pick out any landmarks at all... It'll be tricky without the 21st century light pollution. You're certain that that was Saint-Nazaire? It was the only coastline bombing of that scope in 1940. Alright, alright. - Give me some pencils. - Scheduling. - Okay. Let's keep an eye out for storms. Don't you start. 'Time travel storm' is just insane. I know. None of this makes any sense. It will start to make sense once we know where we are. So lets focus on that for now, okay? Mayday. This is IA Flight 42 out of Dulles. Open transmission to anyone. We were en route to Heathrow and we got blown off course. Looking for assistance. Repeat. This is IA Flight 42. Mayday. Is anyone out there? Over. You're clear for miles according to the radar. Let's try to figure out where the hell we are. Hey, over there. Is that a river? Man... maybe? Sketch it anyway. This is unbelievable. I mean, right now below us the invasion is in full swing. If this really is June, Hitler is about half way through the tour of his forces. Another week from now, he'll be in Paris. Shouldn't there be lights? Cities? Probably just a power outage. It would explain why we can't hail anyone. Repeat. This is Flight 42. If anyone can hear me, please acknowledge. French, I think. Maybe those guys are right. Maybe we are in France. Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait wait. Is that German? Flight. Repeat. Airspace. Over. Hello? This is Captain William Strong. IA Flight 42. Do you copy? Violation of international airspace. Please identify yourself. This is Captain William Strong, requesting assistance. Do you copy? Captain? Listen, whoever this is, this is a localized channel to be used for emergencies only. Over. This is Flight 42 out of Dulles. We've been flying blind. We think we just saw some German bombers. Bombers? You're claiming to be aboard an aircraft? Yes! Hello? My name is Corporal Nigel Sheffield. My position is classified but it's my duty To intercept long-range transmissions. And it's simply Not possible for you to be aboard an aircraft. Look, I don't have time to mess around. Can you just get us in touch with civilian air traffic control. We need to land ASAP. Air traffic control?! This is a war zone! Anyone who can help us. Anyone! All right, Captain. What branch of the military are you with? We are a commercial airline. International. And you've flown through a German bombing run? No. Absurd. Look, can you just help us get our bearing? What is the GMT? Fine, Captain. It's 17th June, 21:30 hours. And the year? Are you joking? Let's all just get on the same page, Nigel, okay? It's the 17th of June, 1940. Do they not stock calendars on commercial airlines? If this charade is quite finished, I highly recommend you get off this channel and- Listen! I don't know if you're part of some sick hoax but we are in distress! You're the only person we've been able to reach. Hoax?! Certainly not. Now kindly remove yourself from this frequency and- How do I convince you that we are a commercial airline in distress?! I'm sure I don't know, Captain. Here. Here! It has to be. So if that's Rene then that means... Oh, we've got to tell the captain. Come on. Come on. Look, even if this is a hoax, Nigel, whoever you are. All we've got is our fuel gauge, altitude, and radar that's working at the moment. Your radar? You know, radio detection? Scans the skies and lets you know where other aircrafts and objects are. Well that certainly sounds familiar to the RDF technology we Brits are developing but I've nothing like that at my disposal. Well, that's the only thing that's keeping us up in the air at the moment. Captain, we think we know where we are. Nigel, I've just been joined by a couple of history professors. They think they know where we are. I beg your pardon? We were able to pick out a very identifiable river and surrounding hills. We've just passed over Rennes, in the northwest of France. Based on the timing since the bombing, it's our best guess. We're relatively certain that we flew through the bombing of Saint-Nazaire, where the RMS Lancastria was attacked and sunk. Sunk? The Lancastria? Even if that were true, how could you possibly... You're going to find this hard to believe but... We were en route from D.C. to London. In the 21st century and we flew through a storm... something... and now we're here. This is highly... Oh forget about that. This is what we know: we're up here all alone and we're in a war zone. Nigel, we could die without your help. What if we were able to tell you about the bombing of Saint-Nazaire? What could you tell me? The air forces... Junker Ju 88s, Heinkel He 111s, a Messerschmitt Bf 110. Likely prototypes. And the Lancastria. Radio the front. They will be able to confirm she was lost. Yes, well I'll do just that. If you're serious call back on this frequency in thirty minutes. We can't wait thirty minutes. Call us back in five. I'll do all I can. God help me. Show me the route. The two points you figured out. Can you determine the course? Hopefully. Then we can figure out our range. Just under half a tank right now. Ah, Sheffield. Colonel, a moment? Any news? One transmission, sir. But you're going to want to hear about it. Ladies and gentlemen! I- I have information that this flight crew has neglected to give us. Sir, I'm going to need yo- Get your hands off of me! I know how this is going to sound but I believe that somehow we have travelled through time. How many drinks have you had? We all saw that storm. And the planes. The bombs. She knows! Somehow we time travelled back to the middle of World War II. Everyone, please stay calm. Th- No! No! No one is telling us anything and we have a right to know! Sit down. You're scaring everyone. You, you might not believe that we travelled through time but we're clearly in a war zone. So what? So? We're not going to survive. This jet wasn't built for war. Listen! Listen! Do you know what this means? Right now, as we speak we're flying over France in June of 1940. On the ground Hitler has joined his forces. We-all of us, all of us, -we have one opportunity to change human history. We can kill Hitler. Uh, okay... and um... how do you propose that we do that? They tried to assassinate Hitler in war and they failed. Okay, during the war, they were operating on outdated intelligence. We know exactly where Hitler will be. It's all here in this book. Everything. Step by step details. Information exactly where the SS and Hitler went. Okay, they will see us coming from miles away. It's suicide. It wouldn't work. We're surrounded by bombers and attack planes. We're probably not going to survive. But we can land this plane. We can find Hitler and we can kill him. Okay, that's enough. Whoa whoa whoa! Hey! Let him go! He's right. We need to take matters into our own hands. We could prevent the Holocaust. We would just need to find a safe place to land. And convince the pilots. - Gentlemen! - Stop, stop, stop. Stand down. I would think that you would be on our side, sergeant. We can win this war. Or you could be making the whole thing up. But what I do know is that you're trying to hijack this plane. And that's an act of terrorism. I'm a patriot. Listen, we can do this the easy way or the hard way. But there's no way me and Private Jackson here are letting you take that cockpit. You think you can stop us? I don't think you want to find out. We could use you in this plan, Sergeant. You could be heroes. I'd prefer not to fight over this. Get off of me! You! Aah! What was that? You're not thinking this through. No, sir, you're not thinking this through! Suppose we try it. It's easy to make a mistake, even when you think you know exactly where the enemy is. Trust me. Say it really is World War II down there, and we make one slip up. Just one. The Axis will have this plane, the technology, And that book, which will tell Hitler everything. There will be a Nazi flag flying from the White House, all because you wanted to be a hero. And maybe we can change the past. But we can also screw it up. Forever. Now get back to your seat and shut the hell up! Now get back to your seat and shut the hell up! Yeah? Everyone okay back there? Yes, nothing we couldn't handle. We can always tie him up. I think the fight's out of him. Isn't that right? Yeah, uh, yes sir. We'll keep him out of your way, ma'am. Thank you. Thanks, yourself. You swing a mean fire extinguisher. At our current speed we've got about a hundred and fifty minutes in the air, tops. That's not counting climbing or descending either. At least we know where we're headed. We do know where we are headed, right? We should be just about in the middle of France. So if we maintain our course we should be able to find some friendlies or find a safe landing place soon. Right? What happened? Some idiots on board tried to hijack the plane in order to kill Hitler. Some soldiers aboard helped defuse the situation but passengers are going to need some answers. And soon. Corporal Nigel Sheffield calling Captain William Strong. This is Captain Strong. Go ahead, Nigel. So you're still here. I'm afraid you're stuck with us. And that was more like ten minutes, Nigel. Yes, well, some things take time, Captain. I've talked things over with Command, as well as the boys on the Western front and... Well, we're inclined to believe you. Not about the, uh, time travel, you understand. Your intel about the Lancastria seems to be accurate. And the truth is, it's helped us out a lot. No one on the ground was able to ascertain the extent of the firepower. And the Jerrys would certainly not give up that kind of information. I'm glad we're on the same page about something, Nigel. Yes, well we could do with any little bit of good intel we can now. After Dunkirk. Sorry about that. It was just such a bloody rout. Rout? No, no, no. Allied forces evacuated hundreds of thousands of troops. Evacuated? Have you not seen a newspaper? The Jerry's caught us from both sides. It was a bloody slaughter. Nearly half a million of us killed, cut down. What is it? He said that Dunkirk was a slaughter. That's not how it happened. Dunkirk was a hugely successful allied evacuation mission. They rescued 400,000 troops. So if you're right, the past that we're in is not the one that we know. Sorry about that, Nigel. Well Captain, I suppose the question is, how can I help? Right now we need two things. A safe route and a safe place to land. And also, any information you have on any unusual storms in the areas. I'll do what I can, Captain. What's your current position? We're near Vire, near as we can tell. Just passed Rennes not too long ago, heading in a straight line. You're nearing the German border then. What's your current airspeed? 400 knots. I hate to say this, Captain, but the first thing you'll need to do is change course. We've intercepted chatter on German frequencies. There's been talk of a rather large aircraft over France. So whoever is performing these bombing runs knows we're here. Are there any friendlies in the area? Anyone who can get their eyes on us? Difficult to say without knowing exactly where you are. What if we were more visible? How do you mean? We've been flying with our nav lights off. But we can turn on our landing and running lights. Are you sure about that? Most of our systems are out. They're analog, right? Here goes. Take this to the Colonel immediately! Nigel? We've got something coming straight for us. One moment, Captain. It could just be Allies. Well we got company about 30 seconds out, coming fast. Well, Captain, no sightings of any aircraft on our end. Gentlemen, I need you in your seats, now. And not a word to anyone. Get everyone secured. Will, I- Now! Captain, just got word that some German activity is heading your way. All secure back here, Captain. It's a god damn Nazi plane. They've got jets too? They shouldn't have those yet! Kill the lights. How's that possible? Talk to me, Daniel. They're coming in behind us! They're still on us. I know! Captain? Will, are you there? Not now, Nigel. Getting shot at. IA Flight 42 do you copy? Do you copy? Damn it! Damn it! You got a plan? Yeah. Kind of. Don't freak out. What? Why? Three thousand feet. Two thousand feet. Will, one thousand!! Hold on! Pull! Two planes! Right behind us! Dan! Just hang on! We need first aid in the cockpit! Stat! Daniel's been hit! Hang on, buddy! I've got you! No no no no no! Hang on, buddy! Okay, okay, okay. All right, let me take a look at it. Let me look. It's not as bad as it looks. Are you sure about that? It's mostly superficial. You could use some stitches but it's going to have to wait. You okay? Yeah, it hurts like a son-of-a-bitch but I'll be fine. How's the plane? Could be a lot worse. Burned some serious fuel during that move but we're not actively losing any. We've lost cabin pressure. I'll keep us below 15,000 feet. Is that bad? Definitely bad. We'll probably have to cycle it again. Nigel, we've got a problem, buddy. Nigel? Did the radio get hit? No, I just got static. I think we're out of range. Hopefully. So, we can stay in cloud cover and stay safe or we can talk to our friend, Nigel, and get shot at! And we can't land without our front wheels. Perfect. Captain? Just give me a minute. Will, if the passengers know what's going on, maybe some of them can help. We have to work together right now. All of us. Daniel, can you fly the plane? Yeah, I think so. Yeah. I'm going to need some extra hands, just in case. Stay with him. Take my seat. Are you sure? I'm sure. - Cameron, come on. - All right. Sir, take your seat this instant. Keep us in the dark? We need to know if we're going to die up here! - Sir, I need you to calm down. - You haven't told us one thing. Sir, we need you to keep calm and take your seat, okay? Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm your captain, William Strong. And it's time I tell you the truth. We're on the move, sir? Not you. We need you to stay put. Any news from our friends? Not much. Last I checked they were in a dogfight with Jerries. I lost contact. I fear they... I'll keep trying sir. If you manage to make contact, gather information about their radar. Yes, sir. I'll do all I can. If this really is some kind of super plane, better destroyed than captured by the Axis. We may have no choice but to blow the damn thing out of the sky ourselves. I want to apologize for keeping you in the dark for so long. We encountered what we thought was a weather anomaly but it's something more than that. Some of us, including my co-pilot, Daniel, believe that we have traveled back in time. With the assistance of these men as well as my contact on the ground, we've determined that we're over France. These men believe it's currently 1940. That's impossible. Regardless, we are in a war zone and we're all in danger. If we stay in cloud cover though, we'll be safe. The most important thing you can do, all of you, is remain calm. All we can do is fly and try to find a safe place to land. Do we all agree? As for the landing, the other planes that were firing at us have damaged our landing gear. It won't open. I'm going to try and fix it. But I can't do it alone. Is there anyone here who can help me? Who's willing to go below and help? Captain? I'm an engineer. We're working with hydraulics, right? That's right. I'll go with you. Thank you. Theresa. That would be a great help, Theresa. Anyone else? Yo los puedo ayudar. I... uh..can help. I... uh... handyman, as you say. Thank you, mister- Hector. Me llamo Hector. Happy to have you, Hector. Thank you. Con gusto, Capitan. Much appreciated. We're going to head below. The flight crew's in charge. Daniel will keep us in the air. If there's any trouble he'll contact me. We're done keeping you in the dark. Now we're focused on keeping everyone safe. Theresa. Hector. Follow me. Everything will be alright. You know time travel is impossible, right? Of course I do. All things are possible, if you have faith. All things are possible, if you have faith. No puncture. That's good. Captain, look at this. Maybe, uh, we can... uh, splice? You're on top of things. I like that, Hector. All right, that should do it. Stay back! Stay back! Daniel! We've just opened the doors. Try and lower the gear now. Copy that. That's a negative, Will. Captain, look! I see it. We have to get that out. Hey Daniel, try and close the landing gear again. Did that do it? Negative, Daniel! Still wide open. I could jump to the landing gear and try to bang out that shrapnel. That's insane. I'm open to better ideas. Daniel, we have to slow her down to cut down on the wind. Take it down to 150 knots or so, okay? Hold on! Captain. Please. I fix. Hector, I can't let you go down. Plane needs two pilots. Needs you. Please, I try. Please. Be careful, Hector. I think that did it, Will. Hector, hang on! Hang on, Hector! Hang on, Hector! Help! Swing onto the wheels! Come on, Hector. You've got this. Hector! Come on! Hector! Close the landing gear now! Come on, Hector. Take my hand. Come on, Hector. Will, is everything all right? We're okay. Hang tight. We're coming up. The landing gear is fixed. Thanks to these two heroes right here. How are we doing? We burned more of our fuel than we wanted with those moves. Got about 90 minutes of flight time, give or take. How's our current heading? Should be almost to the border between France and Switzerland. Good work, Brianna. I'll take over. Okay. We need to contact Nigel. Tell him we don't have much time. We have to go below the clouds. I already got shot once today. Ladies and gentlemen, we will be making a descent in order to establish radio contact. Nigel, come in. Can you hear me? Captain Strong! Nigel, good to hear your voice! My god. You broke off contact so abruptly, I- I feared the worst. How on earth did you manage to lose those planes? We had to ditch them by going above the clouds. At least now we know our radio transmission ranges. What's your current location? We're just above the Swiss border. We have about 80 minutes of flying left which is not a lot of time to figure things out. Earlier, you mentioned something about a... weather anomaly? That's right. Before we got displaced we went through the center of a storm the likes of which I've never seen. Black clouds and some kind of blue energy in the center of it. Right, I will investigate. Now the most pressing matter, of course, is your proximity to German airspace. I suggest you stay on course. I'm trying to find a potential landing spot for you. And my commanding officer is insisting I get more information about this "radar" of yours. What do you want to know, Nigel? Well, everything you can tell me. Captain, may I? Sir, this is Bennet. The radar is in the nose of the plane and gives off radio waves to determine the objects in the area. In the cockpit there's a console that looks like a bullseye. It sweeps the area for signals and the blips on the screen indicating our distance. That's about it. It certainly sounds simple enough. It also sounds incredibly useful. It's kept us alive so far, Nigel. Well hopefully you Americans will get involved in the war sooner rather than later and you can help us out on the technology front. Like I said, Nigel, we'd give it to you if we could. William, there's something else you should know. My commanding officers- Shit! We've got company again, Nigel! We might lose you again, Nigel! Just keep yourselves safe. Will, incoming! Where are they? We've got one behind and one ahead. Okay, let's do this. Will?! Will! William! Hold on! Hold on! Hold on! Hold on! Pull!!! How's everybody back there? The passengers? The crew? Uh, a few broken windows and everybody's really shaken, but we'll be fine so... Thanks. Let's talk options. We're stuck. The radar only gives us a small amount of warning, which leaves our windows to talk to Nigel tiny. That's because the radar is localized to us. We're the epicenter of the signal, right? It can only track what's around us? That's right. What if we had a radar on the ground? One that we could use to help us track enemy fighters. That would be helpful, yes. So....let's give it to Nigel. Nigel's story doesn't make sense, okay? They should have radar by now. The way he talks it makes it seem like it's years off. Maybe this is why we're here. Not to kill Hitler. But maybe WE bring radar to the British. We could cut it out of the nose of the plane. Air drop it to an agreed-upon spot. They could hook it up and be our air traffic control. What about changing history? From what we've heard, it seems like history's already been changed. They lost the battle at Dunkirk. Who knows what else is different down there? This could get them and us back to the history we remember. Maybe, maybe this could fix everything. Will, you may not believe in time travel but you said yourself, we're out of options. Will? Let's call Nigel and tell him he's getting an early Christmas present. Holy shit, a missile! Engine One is flaming out. Kill it! Fire up again. Again! It's okay, people. Just hang in there a little longer. Nigel, come in! Come in, Nigel! Will! Thank God. I thought I lost you for good. We're still here for the moment, my friend. Almost got blown to bits by a missile. A missile? From another plane? No, I think it was surface to air. Will, I feel I must tell you... Nigel, listen. We're about 100 miles from the Swiss border. We want to give you a gift: our radar. Think you could find us a drop site? Captain....Will, are you sure you want to do that? It is our only way to find a clear path to a friendlier sky. Will, you should be somewhere near Metz at the moment, correct? That's correct. You should be passing over Boulay-Moselle in 10 minutes. That's right. I'll make damn certain there's a platoon there to intercept the radar if you'll be able to make the drop. We'll make it. Then I have to sign off. Ten minutes. A field near the forest, in German territory. You can't miss it. We'll get it to you. Godspeed, my friend. Over and out. You heard him. Ten minutes. Bennet, you and Daniel head down. Take Hector and Theresa. Cut the box out of the nose. Bundle it with a screen. Dale, we need to give this radar a smooth ride. Make something that will make it survive a drop of about a few thousand feet. Ah, Sheffield. You must listen to me. We can't make another attempt to target them. We have to help them get to safety. Nigel, we've talked about what would happen if- They want to give us their radar system. Air-drop it to us. The only way we can get it is if you call off the bloody attacks. Corporal, call off all surface-to-air strikes Immediately! - Immediately! - Yes, sir! Are these your bags? Do you have anything we can use as a parachute? Miss, Miss, can I help? I'm looking for anything we can use as some sort of parachute. I think-I think I can help. I picked these up for the grandkids. I- I mean, they live in London. Thank you so much. I've got a bag. All right. Tie it to the zippers. Daniel, How to power? I need a USB battery, does anyone have one? I have one. I have one. Get it all in there. Let's go, go, go, go. Bennett? We're under 10,000 feet. Let her rip. Roger that, Captain. One... two... three. Captain, the package is in the air. I repeat, the package is in the air. Nigel, the package is away! Brilliant. We're sending troops to capture it now. I'm going to start climbing now. Move double time. Our code-breakers are hearing a LOT of chatter. You're going to have company very soon. Let's get out! Come on guys! Out! Nigel, we don't have much time! How's the package looking? It should be here in mere moments. Just hold on. Go kid, go. Will, we've got the package. It's en route. It's en route to YOU? I'm the closest radio operator to the drop site. Nigel, you're our guardian angel. Look out! Bloody hell, you found it! Will, we have the radar. Great work, Nigel. Now work fast. We've got a lot of company up here! Nigel, we're almost out of fuel. We need eyes in the sky now! Um... There! Scanning the skies now! Uh..okay. Captain, turn due southeast and hit the throttle now. Are you sure, Nigel? Yes, I'm sure. Now move! Shit! I can't shake them! Right-o. Let's shoot these bastards out of the sky. It really is World War II. It just couldn't be anything else. Where did the cavalry come from? Oh, did my colleagues arrive? Nigel, you beautiful bastard. You were right. It really is 1940. Yes, of course it is. You should have clear skies. I'll direct you to a safe landing site. I can't be certain I'm reading this correctly but there's a rather large "blip" in front of you. Is it another airplane? Should we reroute? It appears to be stationary. You should be able to see it. It's dead ahead. What are you seeing, gentlemen? It's that vortex. The one that brought us here. The same one. We have to go through right. We've got about 10 minutes, Nigel. Still trying to hail a suitable landing site for you within range. Will, all I know is that thing brought us here and we can't make it to a safe landing in 1940. As much as I hate to admit it, this is your best option. Ladies and gentlemen, things are going to get bumpy again. I want to thank you for your patience, assistance, and your faith in the last few hours. I'm proud of each and every one of you. That felt like a goodbye. We'll find out in a few minutes. Nigel, we can't thank you enough for everything you've done. That's what allies do, Captain. Take care of yourself. You do the same, Captain. To you and everyone on Flight 42. Here we go. IA 42, Jesus Christ, where did you go? We've got you almost directly over TXL in Germany. Your certain? We're flying on vapors. We've got to land now! IA 42, this is TXL Tower. We are clearing the pathway and sending out emergency equipment. IA 42, the runways are clear. Bring her in. We're out of fuel. Okay... let's glide this baby in. IA 42, choose a runway at your discretion. They're all clear. Bring her in. Drop the flaps. Gear down. Keep it steady. Keep her steady, that's right. Steady as she goes. Round up all emergency service vehicles to Runway 8 left. They are stopped between intersections D and Z. Units fall in. TXL, this is flight 42. We have touched down, safe and sound. Copy that, IA 42. Welcome to Berlin. TXL, what year is it? I like your sense of humor, Captain. Welcome back. I love Germany. This Germany. That's everyone. There's one more gentleman in the back, though. - I'll take care of it. You go. - Okay. Excuse me, sir. It's time to go now. Oh, just one more moment, Captain. I'm just finishing something up here. There. Dreadfully sorry to have kept you waiting. I'm ready now. As they say, there's not time like the present. Should we go? Thank you.
