Members of the Elizabeth Company, this is your beginners call. You'll begin this call. Your call, please, Joe Ayew, Catherine Hampton, Peter Marius and Jane Pipe. Summon please, lighting, sound, stage management, flies, costume, weights and stage crew. Your beginners call, thank you. In the White Drawing Room. - I have moved the furniture. - Yes. And I, um, have lit the fire so that it looks quite sort of friendly like. - Do you think they're ready? - Yes, ma'am, they are indeed. Let me entertain you Let me entertain you Let me entertain you Let me Enter... tain you Let me Enter... tain you Yeah, yeah Yeah - And a different sort of camera. - Electronic camera. And, uh, that's the teleprompter which you will have... - Is that far enough in for you? - No. - No? - Because that's right in the way. Oh, I see what you mean. - It's for the radio version... - For the radio, I see. - And a run-through -of the words. - Mm-hm. Clothes wise, does it look alright with the background? Yes, it does. I mean, jolly lucky. I'd be awful if you'd said no because I'd have to find something else. Yes, it's alright for this. Whenever you're ready, ma'am. Red and green should never be seen, but never mind. Over the years, I have dwelt on the happier side of life in my Christmas Broadcasts. We need reminding of it, particularly at Christmas time. This year, there have been, I hope, times of happiness and good cheer for most of us. My family, for instance, has been celebrating my youngest grandchild's christening. Old documentaries about the Queen and the new documentaries, her accent has changed. She's more, you know... Before it was, like, "Oh, la-la-la," but these days it's more like, "Ha-ha-ha-ha." So it's more like a street language, as if she's rapping. Ladies and gentlemen... I want to tell you all throughout the ages... and in grateful memory... for our enjoyment... it will not be easy... But it is a fragile institution. By merely dialing the right number up to a distance of some 300 miles. I feel that her own natural self is not allowed to come through And if she herself were allowed to speak, the effect would be wonderful. Do you expect the Queen to have qualities of a wit? You would like her to be a better orator? You would like her to be a TV personality, in addition to being a diligent, dutiful and devoted monarch and a mother? What I was suggesting is, is that spontaneity should be the key note, even if they're prepared from seeming to be the sort of speech that she would make. That will teach you to insult the Queen. To terminate the interview, I'm obliged to you for answering my questions. Next week, at this time, there will be another edition of Impact. Goodnight. When speaking to the Queen your first introduction should be addressed as "Your Majesty". From then on you should address her as "ma'am". - Ma'am. - Yeah. Your Majesty. - Ma'am. - Ma'am, right. To go down on the stool, very simple. The conversation, you'll know it's come to an end, handshake... Put your left foot at the left side, reverse back. And bend the right knee. And if the Ambassador and the High Commissioners can be on my right, their spouse is on their right. Grasp the handle with your right hand. If the President is on my right, then you'll walk in two paces or so and stop. When the doors open, and you're first there, little neck bow or a little curtsey from the ladies, if you feel that appropriate. Right, I want your heels on the edge of the curb. Come forward. Get forward so your heels are on the edge of the curb! To, uh, make sure that the seating provides the best possible mix we color code the different sort of people, uh, categories of people. At what point will we hand over the gifts? There's no handing over of gifts. It's simply a viewing. They're really just on display. These'll arrive in advance of the... - of the, of the visit, I would suggest. - Yes. Are laid out on a table. And it's simply a walk past. - There's no actual giving. - Oh, I see. She says nothing. So, once you have received the accolade, stand up, and come round to the left-hand side of the stool. This lady acts as the Queen's stand-in at rehearsals for major events. You've done Windsor, you've done the Cenotaph. State opening of Parliament. VJ Day. That was the best one because I rode in her carriage around Trafalgar Square on a lovely sunny afternoon. Everybody was waving at me. It's very hard to smile for a long time, too. It's quite difficult. There you are. Bless. You did this last year, didn't you? No, I haven't done it for about... - I was Queen last year. - Deborah last year. - You did it last year? - I did. Duke of Kent. Prince of Wales. The Duke of Gloucester in the middle. Right, gentlemen, the Queen is coming down the stairs. Good afternoon, Your Majesty. Commander Henry Duffy. Captain of HMS Liverpool. Very nice to meet you, Commander. Absolutely delighted. Admiral, you need to chit-chat with the Queen here, now. - Sorry? - You're gonna have to talk to the Queen. - Small talk. - Small talk. I think it would probably focus... Talk about her dogs. How are her dogs? - No. Louise, stop getting surreal. - Oh, sorry. I once had a girl Or should I say she once had me She showed me her room Isn't it good Norwegian wood? Basically a year's worth of insignia. From terribly expensive stuff, which is used very rarely, to things like MBEs and OBEs, which we probably get through a couple of thousand a year. There you go. John Winston Lennon. He came to an investiture at Buckingham Palace on the 26th of October, 1965. And on the 26th of November, 1969, he returned it to us... for various reasons. And then she said it's time for bed The Queen was very much part of our lives as we were growing up. My mum liked the Queen. You know, there was that sense of the Commonwealth and the mother country. And she came from Jamaica in the 50s. She literally had this idea that the Queen had invited her to come to Britain to work. Now the end of their journey is near. What will they find in the land they regard as an El Dorado? Well, what do you consider are the dangers of an increasing colored population? There are many immediate evils of the colored invasion, but in our opinion, the most important is the long-term one of mass inter-breeding. When I did the Royal Variety the first time, and my mum being there on the same tier at the London Palladium waving at her constantly. "Hello, that's my son." And my mum's here tonight. Did the Queen wave back? I think... I think she might have called security. Coming up the river to the pool of London... seeing Tower Bridge opening. And we had the Prime Minister, Sir Winston Churchill, with us. And, uh, one saw this dirty commercial river as one came up, and he was describing it as the silver thread which runs through the history of Britain. He saw things in a very romantic and glittering way. So, perhaps one was looking at it in a rather too mundane way. And then to come up the river in a small boat with all the sides of the river completely... people on each side. Wonderful. And so this day of days most memorable comes to an end. And with it begins a new era. The new Elizabethan Age. An age in which the love and faith and hope of all the Commonwealth rests on the slim shoulders of the beautiful Queen who has just been crowned. Long may she reign. Part of Great Britain, capital city of a former empire that embraced a quarter of the world's population and land area. An empire, they said, upon which the sun never set. But recently it has set. Now it is part of the Commonwealth. Some doubted whether this organization would succeed, but she has assiduously supported it. Growing it from just seven members in 1952, to 53 today. She has played the leading role in building a unique family of nations that spans every continent, all the main religions, and nearly a third of the world's population. We are no longer citizens of, uh, Rome, so to speak. But we are, many of us, still alive who were once citizens of Rome. I was a British subject. And, uh, we share a certain background which makes us understand each other. And she represents that continuity and change. Because her role has changed, too. In this modern age, the strength and unity of the Commonwealth family does not lie in bonds forged by formal instruments nor in common ancestry, nor in pursuing the same political line. It springs from the knowledge that we all share a lively concern for individual freedom and all the machinery which makes this possible. There are several expressions of this unity. As the Head of the Commonwealth I am one. The Commonwealth will survive without the Queen because I think it's got its own rationale, its own internal dynamic that justifies it. On the other hand, she does serve a function because there are large sections, firstly of the Commonwealth, who do look positively towards the symbolism that is bound up in the monarchy. And, in any case, she is very fine at her job. I mean, you know, she really is very good at going to countries, going to heads of government, conferences, talking to people, and being knowledgeable about their problems and knowledgeable about world affairs. I have no doubt that she does that job very well. I see the balloons are still stuck in the tree there. Yes, we were trying to get the keeper of the Privy Purse to take a shotgun out. But there's horrible bits of shredded rubber. - Yes. - They hit the trees and exploded. And the garden's absolutely full of dead balloons. It's very, very disagreeable. Very nice. Very nice. Nobody stands in front of the Mona Lisa. Everybody stands, as it were, inside it. We're enveloped in its reproductions from the moment of our birth. There are millions of Mona Lisa's printed on everything from postcards to tea towels, from soap to sweatshirts. It passes the final test of celebrity. It is famous for being famous. It's called the Mona Lisa, though we don't know who the sitter actually was. The Mona Lisa, smiling enigmatically away there, kept her secret. Do you smile to tempt a lover Mona Lisa? Or is this your way To hide a broken heart? Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep They just lie there And they die there Are you warm? Are you real, Mona Lisa? Or just a cold and lonely... which the Louvre will not allow to be filmed or photographed under any circumstances. It is, in fact, a very bad 19th century copy of it. Does it indeed matter that I'm not standing in the Louvre but in the middle of a film studio? I don't think so. It's all a game with the media. And in Artisan life, you either enjoy the fiction or you don't. You think you know me Know what I do But all you think about is what it all means to you I got so much so much to give All you gotta do is be ready ready to live You think you know a lot about my kinda woman But you don't know nothing 'bout me Part woman... and part god. Have I read your riddle, Sphinx? Nowadays, of course, they don't even do sketches. They take photographs, then take them home and copy them. I think that's cheating. Yes, the portrait everybody likes best does look like a photograph. The Annigoni. Yes, I like that one, too. Portraits are supposed to be frightfully self-revealing, aren't they? Show what one's really like. The secret self. And that's the very first Landseer of Queen Victoria. She apparently sat in the library for that. That's an idea, isn't it? Hadn't thought of that. - Have the horse indoors? - Mm. It was one of what I call my "all walks of life" luncheons. Today, we had the head of the CBI, an Olympic swimmer, primary school headmistress, a general in the Salvation Army and Glenda Jackson. It's a bit sticky. I've been to one, ma'am. That was a bit sticky, too. The trouble is, whenever I meet anyone, they're always on their best behavior. And when one's on one's best behavior, one isn't always at one's best. Ow! what some call a royal watcher and a keen one. She left her Sussex home yesterday to grab a prime position in Bradford today. This is the most important bit of the day because this is where we need to make a commitment to where we're going to stand. Okay, right, think this through logically. You've gotta be standing this side of those barriers, so logic says she's gonna get out of the car at one end, in front of that building. We have lots of tiny, small school children. If it's at all possible, if you can allow the children closer to the barriers... Oh, get out of it! Just because they... There already are children at the front! Well, they'll have to come and move us, then, won't they? You may have detected a... A special air of excitement. Well, that's because we've had our most distinguished guest ever in our studio here. We're deeply honored to say, Your Majesty, welcome to Crackerjack. For a start, you have to... you have to tussle with that whole idea of, "Will you curtsey, won't you curtsey? Will you curtsey?" And I decided before, "No, look, curtseying, it's... No, I'm not going to bow down for royal, I'm not going to." And then immediately you do. Immediately you curtsey far too much, too low. There was a group of about four of us around her. And she says a very small thing, you know... "So, are you enjoying the evening?" And everybody goes like this. So, the Queen... I think people are just nervous or they're eager to please, don't want to be beheaded or something. So, the Queen, I'm sure, must think that she's a great comedian or something. I was doing it. Why was I doing it? I don't know. She actually thought I was someone else. I gave her a big smile and she said, "Were you the gentleman on the wires?" I was like, "No." I am the Queen. She said, "Have you been working hard?" And I said, "No, we're having a holiday," you see, because I couldn't think what to say. Because I swam the Channel. - The Channel? - I swam the Channel for Sport Relief. I filled her in why I was here, which I thought was a helpful thing to do, because there was a long queue of people. She asked me how much money was raised. She asked me if I was covered in lard. - It was lard... - Lard? But it's not as much fun as you think. Immediately you walk in, and you feel you're in the presence of power. It's kinda weird when you meet someone that famous, there's almost a kind of glow around them anyway. And for her especially because she's an icon. So when you actually see her, you can't quite believe it's really her. God save our gracious Queen Long live our noble Queen God save the... First garden party of the year has been given by Her Majesty the Queen in the Palace grounds. Here come the toppers and the debutantes. Attending the first of the season's afternoon parties... Commonwealth and Empire, as well as from Britain numbered about 7,000. Happily the weather was nice and bright when the Queen and members of the Royal Family came out across the... Last week there were 37 casualties, or something. Yes, 37. Thirty-seven treatments. - You may be busy. - Thirty-seven treatments, shall we say, - as opposed to casualties. - Yes. But people come so unsuitably dressed, that's the other thing. They'll probably frizzle by the time they get here. And the new shoes, of course. Well, that's rather hazardous. - What do you do? - I'm a hairdresser. - Hairdresser? - Yeah. So, what are you involved with? I'm just along here as a friend. Are you? Yes. Did you get to see the Queen? Oh, yes. As near to her as your cameraman. Yes, yes. - Yeah. It was worth the wait. - Mmm. - Well, she's the same age, born on the same day. - Yeah, same date. I was born the same day as the Queen, you see. In Britain, it chose this moment to rain. Pretty well the first rain in London for a month. Shelter at once became the most important thing. Thousands and thousands of umbrellas and the crowd got thicker and thicker. And then there's this big scrum outside the tea tent. And out from behind the silver urns, and the gladioli, came cups of tea, beautifully presented. Beautifully presented sandwiches which were not cut in triangles, they were cut straight across. So, for anyone who wants to know, that's the way to cut sandwiches to be really fashionable. And then we had one, Vicky had a wobbly when Jim said, "Shall... would you like another cup of tea?" So I said, "Yes". So he went back and came back with two cups of tea. "Got one for her?" And she went charging through, you know. And I had to rush after her and say to the lady, "Could she have a cup of tea, please?" Would you like a cup of tea, Your Majesty? No, not at the moment. I've just-just had lunch. - And out she came. - Well, about "out she came." I mean, Jim was standing there and suddenly... - Well, you could see they all clapped... - stopped. - And cheered and things. - And you peered, and he said, "There she is. Orange dot. The top of the stairs." In the middle of our Our house it has a crowd There's always something happening And it's usually quite loud Our mum she's so house-proud Nothing ever slows her down and a mess is not allowed Our house In the middle of our street Our house In the middle of our Our house In the middle of our street our house Something tells you that you've got to move away from it Father gets up late for work Mother has to iron his shirt Then she sends the kids to school Sees them off with a small kiss She's the one they're going to miss in lots of ways Our house In the middle of our street Our house in the middle of our I remember way back then when everything was true and when We would have such a very good time Such a fine time Such a happy time And I remember how we'd play simply waste the day away Then we'd say nothing would come between us Two dreamers Windsor Castle is getting ready for its big event of the year. A three day state visit by a former shipyard electrician from Gdansk, now the President of Poland, Lech Walesa. But he's amazed by the size of everything, that's what amuses me. - What, the rooms? - Yes. His only two English words are quite interesting words. And he... and he goes round looking, you know, at everything, so sweet. "Good heavens" he could manage, could he? Well, it's better than that, but... Good evening. Draw swords! At last. His Majesty was accompanied by Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Gloucester when he rode from Buckingham Palace to the Horse Guards Parade for the birthday ceremony of Trooping the Colour. The heiress presumptive... A hand, cool and steady, like a Grenadier on parade, is needed for the last finishing touches of paint. Yes, it's the ceremony of Trooping the Colour on the King's birthday with Princess Elizabeth... He just stepped backwards, took about a half step backwards and raised it up in his right hand and then, you know, held it, police marksman style and fired about four or five shots. It was absolutely incredible. It bought it home to us how terribly vulnerable she is. If that had been a real gun, there's no doubt that she would have been dead and that probably a lot of the crowd would have been, as well. Heaven They're off! I'm in heaven On the wrong leg. Look, it's on the wrong leg. No wonder it can't go round the corner. That I can hardly speak And I seem to find The happiness I seek When we're out together Dancing cheek to cheek Heaven I'm in heaven And the cares that hung around me Through the week Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak When we're out together Dancing cheek to cheek Do you know that I haven't watched from a pair of binoculars for ages? Look at it. I'm pouring with tears. - Oh, dear. - I always watch on television. - It's the emotion, perhaps. - No, no, I watch on television. No, Mummy, if you look into the wind like that. It's like looking for deer. Dancing cheek to cheek Oh, I'd love to go out fishing In a river or a creek But I don't enjoy it half as much That's my... my horse. I've got money on the sweep. Many congratulations. Thank you very much. What do I get? Well... you get 16, ma'am. - Sixteen pounds? - Sixteen pounds. Gonna celebrate her... - twenty-five years. - Yes. And she's gonna celebrate her Silver Jubilee. How will she celebrate that, do you think? Have tea. June the 6th, 1977, and the many months of worrying and planning are put to the test in Sheila's street. And they kicked off with one of the best line-ups of fancy dress I've ever come across. Judges, what are we looking for? Yeah, but what are we looking for? Well, basically, the ones that have been made of paper, you know, there's lots of work gone into... What are you looking for, my dear? Originality, I suppose, and also the work that's gone into them and, and general effect of the whole, the whole outfit. Pretty good, really. Nice to see you, dear. Well, we must have the oldest in the street, mustn't we? - Am I the oldest? - Well, that's what... You know you're the oldest. - How old are you, darling? I shouldn't... - Nearly 90. We shouldn't really ask a lady her age, should we? Oh, I don't mind. You are sweet. Does she have her flowers? Oh, you've had your flowers, have you? Darling, I don't... Can you hear me, love? Have you got a message for the Queen you'd like to give as the oldest person in the street? I hope she'll be always healthy. That is the main thing, your health. God bless her. Happy and glorious Long to reign over us God save the Queen Hey, hey! No... the Queen, the Queen. Turn the Queen the other way, you bloody Communists. Get her up that. The right way up, the Queen! Behave yourself. Don't be saying things like that. She ain't done a day's work in her whole life. Why do we have a Queen, do you think? Um... Anyone know, please? - I know. - You know. So she can look after our country. Yeah. And then, when we need help, she can give us help. I've had one interview, 160 turned up. And they only want 14. Fourteen vacancies. There wasn't much chance with that. And I got the letter yesterday to say that I've not been accepted. Today, the Royal Family spend a lot of time encouraging industry. Queen's award, royal visits. The balance has shifted from armies to defend the Empire, to exports to defend the pound. To the works of the English Steel Corporation. Her Majesty and the Duke watched with keenest interest many of the operations in this large steel-making and engineering plant, at which some 10,000 people are employed. I can't pretend to be a great celebrity But still I'm quite important in me way The job I have to do may not sound much to you But all the same I'm very proud to say I'm the girl that makes the thing That drills the hole that holds the ring That drives the rod that turns the knob That works the thingummy bob I'm the girl that makes the thing That holds the oil that oils the ring That takes the shank that moves the crank That works the thingummy bob It's a ticklish sort of job Making a thing for a thingummy bob Especially when you don't know what it's for But it's the girl that makes the thing That drills the hole that holds the ring That makes the thingummy bob That makes the engines roar And it's the girl that makes the thing Hello. I'd like to take some time to give each of us an individual and collective guidance to each of our roles and collective roles on Friday of this week, on the 13th when we receive Her Majesty the Queen and the Chairman and each of their parties. At 10:25, Her Majesty the Queen and Chairman Lee will simultaneously switch on both the microwave and the monitor production lines. They will then walk down the first production line where they may pause to talk to some employees. At an appropriate time, everyone will be moved to a position that lines the official route of the royal party. Union and Korean flags will be distributed. Thank you, Mr. Chairman Lee and Mr. Vice-Chairman Kim for your welcome to Samsung. Samsung have been operating in Teeside for some time. And the success of this venture is based firmly on a partnership between your company and the people of this area. If you are unsure about any of the details that you've just seen for your guidance this program will be repeated every day until Her Majesty's and Chairman Lee's visit. Britain will no longer have a royal yacht. When Britannia completes her final journey the government will end hundreds of years of maritime history by confirming that Britannia will be the last and that there's no money to keep her in service. We are gathered together to commemorate the paying off of the Royal Yacht Britannia. After more than 43 years of distinguished service to Her Majesty the Queen. At John Brown's Yard on Tyneside, the 4,000-ton royal yacht is ready for launching by Her Majesty. For many months, there has been speculation about the name of the new yacht. And there's an air of expectancy as Her Majesty steps forward to perform the actual launching ceremony. I name this ship Britannia. I wish success to her and to all who sail in her. Soon the Britannia will become a home for the Queen, the Duke and their children. We've been able to use Britannia as our traveling home, so to speak, and have been able to go to many more places than would ever have been possible without her. I mean, crossing the Pacific in a ship, which one never does nowadays, was an experience in itself. Three weeks at sea. I stuck in all pictures and photographs in my photograph album, which I'd never have done otherwise. One, two, three. Thank you, ma'am. Look at the girl she's like a dream come true Ah, look at that girl can blue eyes be so blue? Look at the way she walks Listen when she talks With each word my heart just skips Oh, if I could kiss those lips Look at that girl she's like a dream come true I don't believe it they're making it up Look at that girl can blue eyes be so blue? But if I'm dreaming please don't wake me up We were like, what, 14. Very formative teenage years. And the Queen was sort of 24, or something. So, to us, she was a babe. So we were... There was a certain lustfulness in us teenagers. That's what we used to say in Liverpool. "God, look at the heave on her". And, uh, so we grew up loving the Queen. So, how do you go about changing actresses appearances as to wardrobe? The first thing I do is to get acquainted with the actress. I actually met Miss Hepburn and made this wardrobe test. And as you'll see, it's pretty successful. This is a transformation as the princess. You see, we don't do any tricks or give her a crown. But we give her a regal dress. A simple dress of real lace. In other words, the type of dress that a real princess would wear. This is even more of a regal costume. This is one of the princess's ball gowns for the opening of the film. We had two costumes from which to choose and we took this one with silver brocade because it was a little more photographic, a little gayer. Now, you notice what she's going to do now. She is turning around in the picture because the producer, William Wyler, said, "It's too long, she can't possibly dance". Now Audrey, who is an accomplished dancer, said, "Just watch me". And that is why... I am so happy that on this, my third visit, my future husband is by my side. My husband and I... My husband and I... My husband and me... Me and my husband... Philip and me... My husband and I... Prince Philip and I... My husband and I... My husband and I... My husband and I... I think everybody really will concede that on this of all days, I should begin my speech with the words "My husband and I." I'm leaning on a lamp I know I look just like a tramp Or you may think I'm hanging round to steal a car But, no, I'm not a crook And if you think that's what I look I'll tell you why I'm here and what my motives are I'm leaning on a lamp post at the corner of the street In case a certain little lady comes by Oh me, oh my I hope the little lady comes by I don't know if she'll get away She doesn't always get away But anyhow I know that she'll try Oh me, oh my I hope the little lady comes by There's no other girl I could wait for But this one I'd break any date for I won't have to ask what she's late for She wouldn't leave me flat she's not a girl like that Oh, she's absolutely beautiful And marvelous and wonderful And anyone can understand why I'm leaning on a lamp post at the corner of the street In case a certain little lady passes by But is it... Is it still as heavy? Yes, it is. Yes, it weighs a ton. And it is impossible to tell which is front and back, I suppose. Very unwieldy. Fortunately, my father and I have about the same sort of shaped head. And you can't look down to read the speech, you have to take the speech up. Because if you did, your neck would break, or it would fall off. So there are some disadvantages to crowns, but otherwise they're quite important things. That's the last lesson. Next Tuesday, we'll all watch the real thing on television. I shan't, Miss Stokes. My parents are taking me to London. I'll really see the real thing. You're a very lucky girl. Never mind. I expect we'll all get a much better view in the end. God save the Queen. God save the Queen. I I will be king And you You will be Queen And nothing Will drive them away We can beat them Just for one day We can be heroes Just for one day And you You can be mean Though nothing Will keep us together We could steal time Just for one day We can be heroes Forever and ever We want the Queen. We want the Queen. As this day draws to its close, I know that my abiding memory of it will be not only the solemnity and beauty of the ceremony, but the inspiration of your loyalty and affection. You'll be my royal highness Queen bee with a little sting to ya You'll be my royal highness My lady with a little freak to ya You'll be my you'll be my royal highness You'll be my, you'll be my Royal highness royal highness It will come along without you knowing It's like finding a needle in a haystack It will come along without you knowing It's like finding Royal highness royal highness It is of great value to a Prime Minister every Tuesday evening, to go and talk to someone with experience, but who is above the political battle. The Prime Minister, Your Majesty. So it's a very frank conversation about everything going on in the world that week. I've been listening to the fact that you've been visiting factories and things. Yes, that's right. The Deputy Prime Minster and I went to a tractor factory in Basildon. As you explain a particular problem that the government has, sometimes you find it is all becoming clearer as you explain it to this one incredibly experienced person. Because you're always very conscious that she's been listening to this stuff for 60 years. Then I would tell her things. Things that I've never told anyone. Things that are locked deep in here. And then as I talk to her I would want her to hold out a soft white hand and say: "Poor thing. You poor, poor thing." There are only two people in the world, frankly, to whom a Prime Minister can say what he likes about his Cabinet colleagues. One's the wife and the other's the Queen. But I have had quite a lot of Prime Ministers, starting with Winston. And some stayed longer than others. They unburden themselves, or they tell me what's going on, or if they've got any problems. And sometimes one can help in that way, too. Are you supposed to be looking as if you're enjoying yourself? Yes. You helped our nation celebrate its bicentennial in 17... in 1976. Wrong year. She gave me a look that only a mother could give a child. Ow, that's my foot you're standing on. - Oh! Now, shall we go that way? - Yes. - We want to go in the sun. - That way. - Is that more fun? - That way. - Come on, Smokey. - Come on. In 1949, Elizabeth proudly presented Prince Charlie to the world. He was the first baby born to a British heir... Your Majesty. Mummy. - How do you feel about her? - Um... she's like... I don't know, the mother, say of... Was there a bit of a tear to the eye as she sailed? - Yeah. Yeah, definitely. - Really? Yeah... What is that special thing that gives British people in particular? I think it's the family thing. I think you belong to a family. In a sense, does she feel like your mother or grandmother? Yes. I think that's... That is the feeling I feel... In the male-dominated world of the mud men, the idea of an all-powerful woman is impossible to grasp. So they know their sovereign as Mrs. Quinn, with much incomprehension or wrang. Elizabeth Elizabeth she's the girl next door But she's a little bit Yeah, to me she's a little bit more When I'm with her then I feel like a king Yes, I feel like a king To be in her grace I would do anything I would do anything I would go down on my knees down on my knees Down on my knees down on my knees down on my knees Down on my knees down on my knees down on my knees Down on my knees down on my knees down on my Oh, Queen Elizabeth You're the one that I wanna be with My Queen Elizabeth Give it up, give it up Give it up just a little bit Oh, Queen Elizabeth You're the one that I wanna be with You're the one that I wanna be with now You're the one that I wanna be with now Elizabeth I am here at your beck and call And in a little bit I'll have you climbing the castle walls All the king's horses and all the king's men Can't keep me away keep me away I'll be your knight any time of the day Any time of the day I will go down on my knees down on my knees Down on my knees down on my knees down on my knees Down on my knees down on my knees down on my knees Down on my knees down on my knees down on my Oh, Queen Elizabeth You're the one that I wanna be with now Don't let's be beastly to the Germans When our victory is ultimately won It was just those nasty Nazis who persuaded them to fight the forthcoming visit of the King and Queen, to Canada and the United States stands out as one of the few peaceful signals on the horizon. Just as among the changing institutions of this world, British monarchy endures. The King and Queen are leaving England on May the 6th for their tour in the New World. And who should be more interested in where their Majesties are going than the small daughters whom they leave behind? Well, you've all read your papers, and you know that Ribbentrop signed a non-aggression pact with Stalin yesterday. As I see it, that means war next week. To get this ship ready to sail. None of us'll turn in, or take our clothes off, or sling our hammocks for the next three days and nights till the job's finished. Then we'll send Hitler a telegram saying, "The Torrin's ready, you can start your war". Campaigns do not wait on weather. Ships must be kept in line by the escort vessel, less they drop behind and crash into isolation. But while at Denham Studios, the King and Queen, accompanied by the Princesses, visited the set of the Noel Coward palladium drama In Which We Serve. Get down, everybody! The royal party met actors and crew before staying to watch some of the filming. Look at the Huns, sir. They're jumping overboard in full marching order. Oh, look at that. Come in, the water's lovely. Open fire! Convoys do not retreat when the enemy attacks or withdraw to new positions. The convoys sail on, having no choice and wishing no others. The whole country is growing food in this fourth year of war, from the small backyard to the big estate. At Sandringham, the King's country estate, the entire park has been ploughed up, including the private golf course, which is now producing oats and rye. The King, with his subjects, has enormously stepped up.. These are some of the girls who are doing their bit for victory. They're taking the place of the men who have joined the fighting services, and they're doing a great job. And what would you like to do? - I'd like to join the ATS. - Why the ATS? Well, plenty of variety, and I shall be doing my bit to help my country. And what would you like to do? Well, I'd like to help to build Spitfires. My boy is in the RAF, and I feel I'm helping him. If you individually succeed, you will have delivered the most devastating blow against the very vitals of the enemy. Let him have it, right on the chin. That was how Air Marshal Harris, Commander-in-Chief Bomber Command gave his instructions for the largest air raid the world has ever known. The target is Dresden. The Queen has been jeered by demonstrators in Dresden on the first day of her state visit to Germany. She was there for a service of reconciliation to commemorate the wartime bombing raid on the city which killed as many as 40,000 people. There was some applause among the catcalls, but the banners refer to the statue recently erected in London to Bomber Harris, blamed here for all that happened to the city. What is the actual protocol when you decide to get married, ma'am? Whose permission do you have to ask? He asked my father. He was very kind to me, actually. I was petrified beforehand. Did he ask you what your prospects are? What sort of prospects? Is Princess Anne's gift to her husband, Captain Mark Phillips. A set of dress studs, cufflinks and buttons. Well, somewhere else I spotted a tool-kit for Captain Mark Phillips. I don't know how much of a handyman he is. Twelve dozen coat hangers. Now there is a very imaginative and a very clever gift for a couple who've just got married. Yes, what a difficult question. What do you think we've got in common? Sense of humor? Um, every outdoor activity, except I don't ride. - Um... - Soon remedy that. Lots of things, really. And, I suppose, in love. Of course. - Whatever "in love" means. - Yes. Well, obviously means two very happy people. The Prince had been up since the early hours yesterday, organizing and taking part in a vastly complicated event involving four members of the Royal Family, and some 50 international stars. - Have you been watching it? - Yes. Yeah. What did you think of it? - Thanks. - I thought it was brilliant. - Great! - Then the royal walkout. He's reported to have said, as he left Alton Towers, "One of these days you lot are going to have to learn some manners". Centuries old Windsor Castle, one of the Queen's residences has been consumed by fire for much of the day. A hundred and fifty-five... They've announced from Buckingham Palace, that with regret, the Prince and Princess of Wales have decided to separate. Their Royal Highnesses have no plans to divorce... Duchess of York have begun discussions about a formal separation. A statement issued by the Queen said talks were not yet complete and nothing more would be said. Buckingham Palace announced today that the Princess Royal and her husband, Captain Mark Phillips, are to separate after nearly 16 years of marriage. The statement said the couple had decided to part... with the sweating, um, because, uh, I-I have a peculiar medical condition, which is that I don't sweat, um, or I didn't sweat at the time. And that was, uh... Yes, I didn't sweat at the time because I... Can't sweat. I bet the Queen was like, "What the fuck is he doing?!" Philip, are you getting this! Our son's an absolute moron! I know. He makes Charles look like Stephen Fry. That Oprah Winfrey conducted with Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. Buckingham Palace issue is a symbiotic relationship between the Palace and the British Press. So then Harry said, "There is this invisible contract behind closed doors behind the institution and UK tabloids." No institution, city, monarchy, whatever, should expect to be free from the scrutiny of those who give it their loyalty and support, not to mention those who don't. And that scrutiny, by one part of another, can be just as effective if it is made with a touch of gentleness, good humor and understanding. Increasingly today, much of the anger which was at first directed at the paparazzi has been focused on the royals themselves. For the past five days, most of the Royal Family, including the Queen, have been 521 miles away at Balmoral leaving the Palace empty, with no flag flying. I feel like everyone else in this country today, utterly devastated. She was a wonderful, warm human being. Very disgraceful I find their behavior. Disgusting that they have not appeared or said a word. I think they must be very, very cold-hearted not to have a flag up. I think it's a disgrace on the whole Royal Family. - I can't understand the Queen doing it, really. - No. Looks as though the Queen is about to... She is, she's getting out of the car, Wes, and is going to talk to people. It's extremely unusual. This is almost unprecedented. I think perhaps the last time... What I say to you now, as your Queen and as a grandmother, I say from my heart. First, I want to pay tribute to Diana myself. She was an exceptional and gifted human being. I don't think he believes me. Prince Andrew. No. There's another one there with a plaque. Prince Andrew, 1969. - That one? - I think so, yes. You-you said... You said that was Andrew. - Can't both be. - No, that's Andrew. Oh dear, oh dear. Edward. - That's Edward. - Yeah. There will be all kinds of different trees growing here - in another 50 years maybe. - Might easily be, yes. I won't be here, though. I was going to say, a sundial neatly planted in the shade. Isn't it good, yes. Had we thought of that? That it was planted in the shade? It wasn't in the shade originally, I'm sure. But, um... Maybe we could move it. Well, it depends whether you want to know the time or not. Through your family records. - Yes. - And I've found an entry here for your great-great-grandmother. And what was her name? Queen Victoria. And what did she do? She was the Queen. You're joking. And their grandson was your grandfather, King George V. And he had two sons, the younger of whom was King George VI. Shove off. From The King's Speech? - That's correct, your father. - My father's Colin Firth? No. Colin Firth played your father in the film. So one isn't related to Colin Firth? - No. - Oh, that's a shame. Three Kings occupied the British throne in a single year. King George departs, beloved after 25 years of rule. And walking behind his coffin, in the sad procession, is the new King, who is the beloved Prince of Wales. God save the King. And even while the proclamation still rings, King Edward stands beside Mr. and Mrs. Simpson in the windows of his apartments at St. James's Palace. Soon he is to tell the world of the woman I love and for her renounce the throne. Then comes the year's third King with his Scottish wife and their two children. King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. And the little Princess Elizabeth, who may one day be Queen. But, you see, nobody writes anymore. I keep a diary, but it's not really a diary like Queen Victoria's, you know, or as detailed as that. It's quite small. But you write it in your own hand? - Oh, yes. - Yes, I think that's terribly important. I can't write any other way. Definitive edition of the plays of JM Barrie. Peter Pan. - He was the most wonderful storyteller. - Yeah. As children we used to go to tea and he'd tell the most wonderful stories. - Did he? - Yes. He just happened to be the sort of person that could tell children's stories. It didn't matter if you were just sitting at the tea table. And, of course, boringly, one was a small child, one didn't realize... - Yeah, quite. - What a good storyteller one was listening to. If only one had known. Oh, Mother, we are back. - Back? - All except the Lost Boys. They weren't quite ready. - Lost B... ready? - To grow up. That's why they went back to Neverland. Neverland? - Yes, but I am. - Am? Uh, ready to grow up. Searchin' every corner of my mind Lookin' for the answers I can't find I have my reasons and life has its lessons I tried to be grateful and count all my blessings But heavy is the head that wears the crown Amen, in Jesus' name yes, I declare it Any little seed I receive I have to share it Bruddas wanna break me down I can't bare it But heavy is the head with the crown I still wear it You can't hold me down I still cope Rain falling down at the BRITs I'm still soaked Tried to put a hole in our shit we'll build boats Two birds with one stone I'll kill both Pray I never lose and pray I never hit the shelf Promise if I do that you'll be checkin' on my health If it's for my people I'll do anything to help If I do it out of love it's not to benefit myself the Queen Mother and Princess Margaret enter their carriage, and there begins the sad last journey of King George VI. Searchin' every corner of my mind Search every corner look for the answers Lookin' for the answers I can't find No, I can't find 'em no silver lining I have my reasons and life has its lessons I tried to be grateful and count all my blessings But heavy is the head that wears the crown In a way, I didn't have an apprenticeship, my father died much too young, and so, it was all a very sudden kind of taking on, and making the best job you can. It's a question of maturing into something that one's got used to doing. And accepting the fact that here you are and it's your fate. God save the Queen. - Hip hip... - Hooray. - Hip hip... - Hooray. The crown is an idea more than a person. Heavy is the head that wears the crown My sister is by my side and we are both going to say goodnight to you. Come on, Margaret. Goodnight, children. Goodnight and good luck to you all. Two. "Her Majesty" take one. Her majesty's... Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl But she doesn't have a lot to say Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl But she changes from day to day I wanna tell her that I love her a lot But I gotta get a bellyful of wine Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl Someday I'm gonna make her mine, oh yeah Someday I'm gonna make her mine - Do you wanna hear it? - Yeah.
