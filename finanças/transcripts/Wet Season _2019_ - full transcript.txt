Good morning. It looks like another wet day again. The met office forecasts... Heavy thunderstorms all over Singapore this morning. Temperatures ranging between 24 and 32 degrees. The arrival of the northeast monsoon... Will mean plenty of wind and rain over the next few months. Rainfall is estimated higher than previous years. Road users should take extra care. On to the traffic... A tree has fallen down... Along bukit timah road... There are reports of flooding... 0nn some roads, causing traffic disruption. Areas affected include... Now for today's headlines. Malaysia's prime minister has again... Dismissed recent accusations... Of money laundering and corruption. Speaking to supporters at a rally yesterday... They'll definitely cancel flag raising. Canteen? Put your phones away. Sorry, teacher. Speak mandarin for this class, please. Sorry, Cher. Uh, mrs lim. Class, stand. Hey. Wei lun. Class, greet. Good morning, mrs lim. Take out your textbooks. I'm just about to leave. He's asleep. I cooked porridge earlier. There's plenty left. You can warm it up for him later. I will, thanks. Father, can you manage a little more? Help me finish it. Your husband didn't come with you today? He's busy. He hasn't come with you recently. Mine's the same. I've no idea where he is half the time. How's everything at school? Busy? My class is taking their finals this year. I'm not expecting them to do very well... But I'm hoping they'll all pass. Relax. Take a deep breath. My son only ever speaks english. I wish his mandarin was better. Looks like there are two mature follicles. Hopefully we'll see more at the next scan. What are the chances this time? It's hard to say. Take a deep breath. It's good that you're still ovulating. We should be positive. Wei lun? Cher what happened to... I got injured during training. Cher, are you sick? - No. - Kok wei lun. I'm heading off. Kok wei lun. I'm coming. Have you called your parents? My parents aren't around. Business trip. Are they away a lot? Cher, turn left here. Sure. Shit. Sorry. Hey. Thanks, Cher. Assholes become assholes... Because we allow them to. The following students... Are to stay for remedial classes... Every Wednesday. Hong kang jie. But ma'am... I've soccer practice on wednesdays. Ye jia hao. Damn. Chen zhi ping. Su yao wei. Peter chan. Who is Peter chan? Me. You're so stupid. Shut up. Hey. Couldn't you write your Chinese name? I forgot how. Kok wei lun. Remedial class. Wednesdays, 3 P.M. Hold on to this. Okay, we're moving over. One, two, three. Let me help you. There's no need. You go to bed. The ministry does allow you to use phonetics if you have to... But I really don't want to see abcds all over your essays. Can you respect the language please? The protestors demand electoral reform. Long live Malaysia! Police fired tear gas into the crowds. According to official statements... 644 people have been arrested... Including opposition party leaders. This is the largest demonstration... In Malaysia since 2007... Father, don't stay up too long. Ma Ling? I saw the protests on the news. Is everything all right there? We're fine of course. We're just a small village. You did the right thing moving to Singapore. Have you heard from your brother? He only calls when he needs something. I keep telling him to find himself a Singapore girl. Things are getting worse in Malaysia. He should learn to take care of himself first. Our neighbours told me about a temple in ipoh. Everyone's prayers get answered. Your brother will give it to you. Why do you listen to them? Did they ask you for money again? I heard it really works. Put it under your pillow. Fine. I've got to get on. Bye. Okay. Bye. I'm still in class. Fine, give me a minute. I have to leave you for a bit. Try and finish in the next hour. You've finished already? It's not an exam, who cares? It's only Chinese. Why take it so seriously? Yeah, why bother staying? Weirdo. Sis. I keep telling you not to come to the school. I told you my class ends at 4 P.M. I was in the area. You still haven't repaid me what I gave you last time. I will, at the end of the month. There's $200 for mum in there. Don't go spending it. Oh, yes. Mum asked me to give you this. W ait. Take some durians. I can't. I'm still in class. With all this rain, they will go off. It'd be a waste. Take care driving back to Malaysia. Where are the others? They left. What rubbish! Have you finished? Almost. Are you hungry? Why didn't you go with them? My parents will kill me if I fail Chinese. They say if my Chinese is bad... How am I to do business in China? There's a mistake here. And there. Thanks, Cher. I thought I saw wrongly... But it's really you mrs lim. Mrs chew, you live here? We moved in not long ago. With kids, we need a bigger space. My student. Cher... I'll head off. We just finished remedial... And I gave him a lift. It's so nice of you. Ma'am. I have to go, see you at school tomorrow. See you. You've got everything? Auntie. Let me do it. I'm sorry I've kept you. Some of these aren't dry yet. This is for the week. Thanks. Take care. Drinking again? Just a couple with a client. I told you to come home earlier. I've been waiting for ages. You could've gone to bed if you're tired. You know I'm ovulating today... I'm taking a shower. The doctor said we should still try. We've been trying for eight years. Do you want to or not? I'm not in the mood. What's father doing in here? Auntie can't make it. I've got to get to work. You're looking after him today. I have work too. Back-to-back meetings. Only your mum calls the house phone. Ma? Your sister. Her baby turns one month next Sunday. She wants us to take father too. You want to go? I already have plans. I'll ask Andrew and let you know. Okay. I'm going to be late. Father! Cher. Yes? Can we postpone this afternoon's remedial? Why? My foot is better now. I'd missed so much training. I've to start preparing for competition. But what about the other boys? Cher, do you think Peter chan and the others will turn up? To be honest, they're not even interested. When do you want it changed to? I'll check the training schedule and let you know. More strength. Speed up. Wei lun, you're next. Be more forceful. Speed up. Good. Higher. Speed up. Hold it. The department head is asking for you. So we're really not going? I've arranged to meet someone. It's not like it's her first baby. Look, they're calling again. I don't want to go either. But father should meet his new grandchild. You're really not coming? Told you I'm playing golf with a client. You won't even show your face at your niece's first month? She's your sister, not mine. Ling, Andrew. What took you so long? The baby's falling asleep. I've got something on. I need to go. I'll pick you up later. Father. Sister-in-law. You are so late. We've already cut the cake. This is for your daughter. Father, look. Your little granddaughter. This too. Thanks, sister-in-law. Where's brother? Playing golf with a client. Golf? In the rain? Ling, do you want to hold her? Oh. Isn't she cute? Don't run, you two. Be careful. She might be hungry. I'll go and feed her. Why would she know? She hasn't had one. Especially wound of the heart... "Wounds" are not easy to heal. At such times... Friendship is like a warm hand. One that gently touches you... And only then will you be able to... Yes. Auntie? What's the matter? Oh... Is your son all right? No, it's fine. Of course you must go. I'll rush back now. I have to rush home. I can't drop you off today. But Cher, we haven't finished. Wait here. Father. Did auntie give you your medicine? Just a moment. My father-in-law. Didn't you want to continue working? What are you waiting for? Here. Finish it. Let's start from the beginning. "Help" Do you know the way home? Yeah. Finish your essay, hand it in tomorrow. Sir. Mrs lim, are you all right? I'm fine. It's dangerous, you know? Falling asleep inside a car. Sorry. - 1... - You look tired. You sure you're okay to drive? Maybe call your husband or something. Not sure if I recall correctly. You're married right? You take care. Rest well. Mrs lim? Come on in. Is mr lim still coming? Let me help. The doctor says we still have his frozen sperm... But fresh ones are always better. I know. I didn't think you were coming. The British pound has fallen again. It's been a busy day. This is new. Doesn't seem like your kind of thing. It's just something from a friend. Lie down with me. You always used to, whenever we got home from hospital. Let's not cook tonight. I'll go out and grab something. Get some rest. Malaysians gathered for another week of anti-government protests. The organisers repeated demands for the prime minister to resign. Pa. All eyes are on Malaysia... As the corruption scandal continues... Finished? Not yet. Hello. I don't have good news. One. Surely? I'm really sorry. None of them were fertilised. Not even one? None. I'm so sorry. Would you like me to call your husband? There's no need. "Thursday, 4 P.M. - wushu competition. Please come." You should go and see your son. I can finish this. All right. I'll see you next week then. Uncle, I'm heading off. Father... Would you like to nap or watch TV? 8.9... For wang guo qiang. And our final competitor for changquan... Is kok wei lun... From Yang guang secondary. Go, Yang guang, go! 9.1... For kok wei lun... Who takes gold for changquan. And gold goes to kok wei lun... From Yang guang secondary. Bye. Cher. Where are your parents? We'll help you celebrate. I won a gold medal. Where are you? Where's father? Father's with me. I took him out. We'll be back soon. You should have told me... How much for the durians? Don't worry about it. It's on your brother. Thank you. "Kok wei lun" Father, what did auntie feed you? Why do you have the runs? "Smile" Father, wake up. Father. Time to wake up. Class, stand. Class, greet. Good morning, mr gan. Please sit. Mrs lim has a passing in her family... 80 she won't be around for a few days. I'll be standing in for her today. Cher, this is a Chinese class. You're a maths teacher. Yeah. The school thinks it's a good idea... To use this time to work on your maths instead. This is a critical year. O-levels are just around the corner. Father didn't have a will... 80 we should split things equally. That's right, Andrew. You've been staying there for free... All these years. What's that supposed to mean? I'm taking the baby up. Just let me know what you decide. If we're going to sell, my husband says we should do it soon. Before the market worsens. Boy, come. You're here. Do it with mummy. "Smile" Class, stand. Class, greet. Good morning, mrs lim. Take out your textbooks. Ma'am, did someone at home die? Hey. Amitabha. That's enough. Get your textbooks out. Cher, how would we know you'd be back? Yeah. Those without textbooks, share with your classmates. Cher, sorry. Why are you apologising? They were just being stupid. Don't take it to heart. Are we still having remedial later? He wrote this book... To encourage people all over... Regardless of race, colour or religion... To learn Chinese together. There's a mistake here. Like this? Hold this for me. Cher, sorry. Why are you apologising again? Your father-in-law. We're here. Wei lun. Why are you bleeding? Shit. Use this. Do you often get nosebleeds? No. That's good. You really adore Jackie chan? Who doesn't like Jackie chan? Still being silly. Better? Let me have a look. What are you doing? Did I do it wrong? Are you okay? Can you leave for a moment? Do you want some water? I have got Coca cola too. No. Just wait outside. Where are you going? I have to leave. Wait till the rain stops? Okay. I'll walk you out. Why did you lie to the piano teacher? I never. Trying to lie again? Mrs lim. Sending your student home again? Private tuition? A lot of teachers are doing it nowadays. The money is quite good. Yup. But hardly do parents spend money on Chinese tuition. Come, let's go. Let me know if you need chemistry tuition. Since we live in the same block, I'll give you a discount. No need, Cher. My science isn't too bad. We can expect a 5 percent improvement... In overall o-level results with this cohort. Subjects we expect to achieve... At least a 10 percent improvement in... Are chemistry... And maths. As for languages... We should continue to maintain our strengths in english... While increasing the number of 'a's and 'b's in mother tongue subjects. We don't have much time. Come. This isn't right. Drive me home. Huh? Drive me home. I already told you... I don't want to take the bus. The bus stop is just there. Okay, I'll go. What are you doing? Are you crazy? Do you know how to drive? I'm sorry, are you okay? What do you think? Look at my car. Your son? Driving like that with a kid on board. Name, ID, phone number. I'm going to take the bus. Will you hurry up? My passenger is waiting. Ah... a female driver. Stupid. Are you all right? I'm fine. Boss, how is it looking? How have you been driving? We just serviced your car recently. Now look at it. You know how much that taxi is claiming from our insurance? Can we go now? Or I'll make my own way home. Ling... Just checking in on you. Have you changed to a Singapore passport yet? Andrew is singaporean... And you two have been married so long... Sorry. I'm sorry, okay? I have nothing to say to you. What do you want? Nothing. What are you looking at? Porn? - Give that back. - It's the Chinese teacher. Oh my god... Check it out. Someone's got a crush. Give it to me. That's enough. Boy. Hey! Kok wei lun. 4b, right? Young man, can you please tell me what's going on here? Sir, they took my phone... I don't mean that. Why are you taking... All these photos of your teacher? You're not making this easy. Sally. Help me get the Chinese teacher. You called for me, sir? Mrs lim, please sit. Do you know about this? Sorry. Young man, I'm deleting all these photos. And I'm confiscating this phone. Go out now. I'll deal with you later. Mrs lim. I don't know what it is. Whether it's private tuition... Or you sending him home... Obviously there is something... Inappropriate going on here. But I don't want to know. You know I'm leaving in a few months, right? Yes. I'm moving on to the ministry for promotion next year. I really don't want any kind of nonsense to leak out... That will make things complicated. So, can you do me a favour, miss lim? Sorry. Mrs lim. Find some reason... Take some time off. What about my students? - Their exams are approaching. - It's fine. It's just Chinese. I'll get the department head to find someone to stand in. I took a look at the numbers. I don't think this class is going to significantly improve their grades anyway. - But they need... - You look tired. Good reason for a break. Does it hurt? You really think you're Jackie chan? Can't believe you're still joking around. What's wrong? Are you breaking up with me? "Breaking up?" It's been wrong from the start. We can't go on like this. Where are you going? What's wrong with you? This is my first break up. Can you at least make it memorable? What do you want? I want to hug you. My heart hurts. It really hurts. That's how it is. You'll get used to it. You can wait in this room. Sorry. It's fine. I think we are done here. I can leave. It's okay. He can stay. Everything is the same as the draft that was sent to you. There's just a slight amendment as requested by mr lim. I understand there's still frozen sperm of mr lim's kept with your gynaecologist. He just wants to be assured that... Should there be any child born out of it... There won't be any legal or financial liability towards the upbringing. So, if we are all agreeable to... Don't worry. I won't be using any of it. He seems to like you very much. What? Her little boy. Why are we talking about this? Don't know. I've always thought you wanted a girl. Taiping. Time to get off now. Ma. Ma, what are you doing? Why are you back? I've got some time off, so I came home. School's out already? What are you washing? It's finally stopped raining... So I thought I'd wash the sheets. What do you want to eat later? Anything is fine.
