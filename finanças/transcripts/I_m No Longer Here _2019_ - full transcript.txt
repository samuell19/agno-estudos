No, dude, I don't have enough. -Not even a five? -Nothing, dude. Damn, buddy. I think I saw you dancing one day I think I saw you showing off At the square of my hometown Dancing cumbia, dancing cumbia And I remember that beautiful melody I remember dancing you told me How sweet this is How sweet this is Hey! -I'll beat the crap out of you. -Come down, dudes! -They're beating up IsaÃ­! -Who is?

Go fuck yourselves! Get down, dude. Hurry. Hey! Ulises! This kid wants to hang with us. -What? Are you a Kolombia? -For sure. -What's your name? -Leo. -Who do you run with? -With no one. Maybe we should just beat the crap out of this kid. -Are you sure you're a Kolombia? -For sure. I'm wearing this sweatshirt but my baggy clothes are at home. "Sweatshirt?" You mean "hoodie," dude. Don't be stupid. -Has he been up there yet? -Not yet. Let's go then, Sweatshirt. So what's up? Are you in school? No, dude, I got expelled. -What did you do, kiddo? -I slapped the principal. -Oh, please! -That's a real Terko, man. This fucking radio is worthless. It's all shout-outs and no music. Shut up. You're not Kolombia, dude. Don't pretend like you are. I think this bitch was listening to NorteÃ±as, right? -NorteÃ±as? Really? -What a fucking narco. What's up, guys? You can't go through here. But, LeÃ³n, buddy, we don't have a dime. I'm not charging a toll. Why would you think that? I'm an honorary Terko. So why can't we? When I went around the corner I saw two armored trucks. That street is no good. I snuck through the alley, -and outsmarted them. -Hey! My cousin just texted me, he said the street is closed. -Another gang or what? -It's the police. They're probably hunting someone down. Let's turn around, dude. Really, man? What, are you scared, or what? Don't be stupid, we don't even know what's going on up there. Let's turn around. -Let's go. -Hey kids, give me something for a beer! Get a job! I sing in buses, dude! I'm not lazy like you. Be careful anyway, kids, it's ugly up there. I'm going this way too. I'm not stupid. But be careful, kids. Bless you anyway. Watch out. Calm down, dude. He's a friend. What's up, kids? What are you up to? -The cops were blocking our way. -Oh, shit. They don't come this way. They know better. -Who's that kid? -That's Sweatshirt, man. -You looking to get high? -Cool, but we're out. -We don't even have money. -So you're leaving? -For sure, dude. -Give them some so they taste it. No, it's cool, dude. We're leaving. For real. -Okay. -Okay, man. -Take care. -Let's go, Terkos. Hey, Ulises! Just a second, brother. Come here, man. Hey, dude. Those are good kids.Â Look after them. They're so young.Â Especially Sweatshirt. He looks like a little kid. I wish I had someone like you to watch out for me when I was a kid. But it didn't happen. And how's the family? -They're fine. -Cool. And your siblings? -They're good. -They must be so big. That's nice. Tell your brother we miss him around here. Me and him started this gang. It's too bad that so many brothers are in jail. Want a cigarette? We're here if you need us, brother. For anything. Sometimes I envy him. He's in a nicer place. I have to hustle here to survive. I remember when you were a kid. You couldn't talk, but you already knew how to dance. -All right, man. -We're here. Hey, Terkos! Pure star symbol, bros. For sure! Stay sharp! But this is too big for me. Look, bud, this is a trick I learned from my dad at the penitentiary. -So they won't fall. -Hey, your favorite! -Oh, shit. That's nice. Cool. -It's cool. That's baggy as hell, dude. It's great. This shit is cool. I just brought it from my house. It's one of my favorites. You like the color? Or do you want another one? This one looks cool, dude. It matches her Converse. -Yeah. -It's cool as shit. -You know it. -Slutty red. Sure. You have such pretty eyes, dude, you should flaunt them. They ran away as usual, bro. They're our bitches, like always. They're just kids in diapers. They didn't get it at all, so we chased them back to their hoods. And that's when the fight stopped, bro. But it all went back to shit. And then Jeremy, Pekesillo, and Ulises jumped in. So we got into a fist fight with the kids from Los Padres. Fuckers. We beat the crap out of them, but they got a few punches too. But I didn't run away. You know, I was with IsaÃ­ and his Terkos. -Right, bro? -For sure. "For sure?" Speak up, you bitch! -Talk like a man. -For sure. -Louder, I didn't hear you. -For sure! -Louder, I can't hear you, bro. -Fuck yeah! You know I don't give a fuck. We were in the middle of a fight when the fucking cops showed up. How I miss my lovely savanna Stuck at the mountain range Waiting for the time To go back to my homeland Back in my neighborhood A doll I used to date The distance kept me sad From all the longing A cumbia blossomed out of my chest And a tear ran through my cheek Cumbia from the soul Cumbia that rises early Even over imprudence With persistence Looking for endurance which I find It makes me so sad, so sad The distance, it makes me So sad, it makes me so sad Being so far away from my homeland It makes me so sad, so sad The distance, it makes me Being so far away from my homeland Hurry up, it's late! Let's go! This kid's trying to find his dickÂ to jerk it off but he can't. The hair! Does he think he's in Dragon Ball Z or something? He looks so mad, I think he's trying to transform! Hey! He can't come in. Why not? He looks like a kid, but he's old enough for it. Come on, bud, let him in. You already know him, dude. And we've been clients here for a while. What's up with that? -Come on, dude. -You know what? Fine, go. Want to dance with my friend? What do you think? This is my friend. He just got here from Mexico. Hey, papi. Are we gonna wait for the next song? -Is he a fag or just shy? -I think he's both. The song is paid for. Come, let's dance. -Come on buddy, get up. -Let's go. -Go, dude, go dance. -Let's go. You don't want to dance? Not to this shitty music. Then buy me a beer. Come. Give me the money. I'll get the beerÂ because that bitch hates my guts. For me, it's even better if you don't want to dance. -I do dance, but not to that shit. -What do you like then? -Kolombias. -What? Colombia? That's the music I like. Colombia isn't a type of music. Colombia is a country. My country. -Are you Colombian, for real? -Me and half of this neighborhood. What Colombian cumbia do you like? Are you trying to test me? How old are you? Don't even tell me, it'll make me feel bad. Do you know what kind of music I like? Binomio de Oro. Lizandro Mesa. That's the type of music I like. You're kidding me! I have them all here, look. "Cuando Lo Negro Sea Bello." It's been ages since I heard that song. Listen. This sounds weird. I think it's running out of battery. And so am I. It's on purpose. If it's slower, it lasts longer. On purpose? Why? What for? I believe that when it's slower you feel it more. Thank you for the beer. Change the batteries next time. Bye. Take him home.Â We're going to keep partying. Sure. You know how to get home, right? All right. Let's go, dude. -Quickly, bro. -Right away. Come on, Chaparra! YOU CAN COUNT ON MY WORD Let's go. Fuck this. Let's go. I like it. It has a thick edge. Didn't I tell you? I knew he'd pick that one. How long will it take you? Not that long, it'll be quick. -Right away, then. -You got it. With him I have a home For a long time You can't give orders to your heart It falls in love on its own -Come on! -You almost hit it! -You almost hit it. -Hey, hey. Hand me that joint. Let's show off our new banner. The new Terkos flag. Take the next oneÂ so I can be in the picture. Flash the gang sign, everyone! Go on, play it. Looks good like that. Kolombiana cumbia! Come on, Terkos, let's go! Let's go, Terkos! Dance the Kolombiana cumbia! Go, Terkos! What's up? Good job, Peke! There's Pedro! What's good? -Dance the cumbia, baby. -Let's go! Cool, cool! -What's up, boss? -What's up? Welcome to the Kolombiana music empire, bros. Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, Kolombia. The best of the best of the neighborhood. What are you looking for? I was looking for something cool. A little bit of everything. Look, bud. Check this one out. I have some vallenato tunes. And some sonideras. And I have some slowed down ones, really cool Kolombias. There's some Kolombias from Peru, and some from Argentina. And what about this? -No, that's mine, it's not for sale. -Why not? It has everything you see here on it.Â -How much for it? -Come on, bro. Since it'll stay in the neighborhood, I'll make an exception. I guess it's your lucky day. Give me 2,000 for it. -That's a lot. -For sure, yes. What's the lowest you'll go? We're family, right? Come on, bro, it's worth it. But let's do 1,500. That's the lowest I'll go. We can get you the money, but next week though. Does that work? Sure, bro. Only if you're serious about it. I mean it, for real. It's for the Terkos, dude. Fine, make it 1,500 and it's yours. We got a deal, boss. God bless you, bro. Stay sharp, kids. We have to start saving so we can buy it. We can't spend our money on alcohol or drugs. Nothing, dude. Did you hear how many songs it had in it? Yes, it was a shitload, and from everywhere, dude. -Hey, kid, you got five pesos? -I don't have anything. -It's for a good cause, brother. -Come on, don't be a dick. Come on, give it. Whatever you have, bro. -Come on, let's go. -Come on. How much did you get? What the hell, kids? I saw what you did, you little bitches. Don't do that shit here. Get the fuck out of here. Why not? This is our school. So what? I'm telling you not to. What's your beef? We aren't messing with you, dog. So what, you bitches? I'm telling you now, don't do that shit around here. You got five pesos, friend? What's that guy's problem? Let's get the hell out of here. -Stay chill and let's go. -Yes, let's get out of here. -Well, whatever. -At least we got something. Fucking shit. What the fuck now? What's up, bro? Your homies already told me. We were in school trying to get some cash and they came to scare us away. -And did they scare you away? -No, not really, man. I came to check what's up. Are they rivals, or what? They're a bunch of pussies trying step to us, but it won't happen. -Come, show them. -Watch this, come. -My name is Shadow. -And why are you here? -They sent me to keep an eye on you. -Keep an eye on us? -Yes. -Do you know who we are? Holy shit! They chopped off his head. And they got off easy. For sure. So what, I know you're Terkos and all, but Pelones till death, right? For sure. Cool. -Call us if you need us. -Okay. -Cool. -Cool. Take out your radio, Chaparra. It ran out of battery. Come in, make yourselves at home. -The bathroom? -Here. Hold on. Come in, go ahead. -Put the beers away. -Where at? That way. Close the door, bud. I'll get my laptopÂ and get the party started. We woke up your friend. Don't worry about him, he doesn't bite. Hi. Answer, or they think you're rude as well as ugly!Â Hey, bitch, have a beer. Go sleep in the room if you want. But don't be jerking off. Let's keep partying. What's up, want to dance? -Come on, bro! Show your moves! -Dance! -Come on, dance! -Dance! Fine. I'll dance, but only if I can pick the song. Let's see what kind of shit this dude plays. Hand me the cable. Here, dude. But don't break it, or you'll have to pay me back. This guy.Â Oh, wow, look at this kid! Who would've thought? Why did you stop it? I liked the song. No, dude, my speakers are going to get screwed. I better play my music. There. You should pass your hat around, maybe you get enough for a taco. What? Show us your moves, dude. What? You didn't like that, or what? Fuck you, dude. You want to be black, but you don't have the moves. -What did you just say, asshole? -Are you deaf, or what? You better leave before I beat the crap out of you in front of everyone. Calm down, dude. We all get made fun of when we're new. What a fucking loser. What, dude? You're all a bunch of pussies, go fuck yourselves. Hey, you bitch! One dollar. Do you want me to do that job upstairs?

It's cool, I guess. I mean, it's not as cool as it could be, but it's cool, right? Wait, are you speaking in Spanish? I just told you, I don't speak English. I don't understand. Well, we're both in the same boat, because I don't understand you. We'll show you the moment when the teacher starts singing with the children despite the violent gunfire they were hearing outside. Let's listen to it. Kids. It's all right. We're safe in here. But, please, keep your heads down. Let's sing a song, okay? -Yes! -Let's sing a song... I know! And the drops...

We only came for the kicks, and now look. I knew that fucking lookout had something going on. I saw the thing falling out and I grabbed it right away. I feel like turning it on. No, don't do that. They're probably looking for that shit. No, dude, they can't track you with that crap. It's only good for talking. Fuck it, dude. It's probably not even charged. 31, on the door. -...single mom? -That's right. Come on, honey. What size pants do you wear?

See what happens when you act like a little thug? You ruined the life of your entire family. I'm doing this for your mom, not for you. She's already suffered enough. You can't talk to anyone! You haven't told anyone you're here, right? -But I didn't know. -For fuck's sake! Hi. Why are you sleeping here? Do you... work for her grandpa? Yes, dude. Does her grandpa know you sleep here? So it's okay if we wake him up and ask him? If her grandpa gave you permission to be here, why did you use the fire escape? She wants to know why you came here to sleep. The fucking pussies I lived with ganged up on me. Why did they hit you. There were a bunch of them, I was alone. Yes, but why did you get into a fight? They were making fun of my hair and the way I speak. She says she likes your... your style. I could've beat them one-on-one, but it was me against four. She wants to know who did your hair. I did it myself. Do you have place to stay? I'll figure it out. Where are you from? From Monterrey, dude. The assholes I lived with... And where are you from, dude? I'm from here, but my parents are from Puebla and Guerrero. -You know those places? -No. I don't know Monterrey either. -How long you been inÂ New York? -Not long. What did she say? She... She doesn't know if she can trust you. No worries. I'll get out of here. Look, man. This girl is super intense. I told her you want to go and that I have to go, but she keeps asking more questions. So just go. Dude... tell her I know I can't stay, but she can trust me. And you too. I don't want any trouble. What's your name? Ulises. Sixteen. How old are you? Seventeen? Nice to meet you. Here in the neighborhoods of Monterrey, the Kolombia cumbia has found a second home.

It's Gladys, the Colombian. Call her. It's urgent, dude. That's what everyone says. Call her! She's my mom. Look, boy. I know you've had a really hard time here. But in this country, you're not the first nor the last. Did you think you'd get invited to the White House on your first day? No, buddy. Look. I already bored you. You're falling asleep. No... I just haven't slept well. Miss, the bill, please. It's here. You'll spend the night here. Think of this asÂ a mutual favor. But remember it. You can stay here. -Are you listening to me? -Yes. -Put some music on. -What? I need some privacy. I'll turn it off. Lord, this is horrible. Today that I find myself alone and sad Today that I find myself alone and sad Thinking about a beautiful rose Remember what you told me You're the owner of my heart I remember what you told me You're the owner of my heart Hey, Jeremy! The people from the Terkos! Hey, Ulises! -Enjoy the cumbia. Enjoy it. -Let's dance! Let's enjoy it! -Who are we? -The Crazy Terkos! How did the angel sleep? Okay, Ulises. You can eat something if you want. Take a loaf of bread. -Can I use the bathroom? -Go ahead. It's okay, boy. You're going to be fine,Â but please don't come looking for me at work again.Â Or here. And no steps back, not even to gain momentum. Thanks. Who is it? Who is it? No one. Good morning, Monterrey! What a beautiful morning,Â a morning for cumbia, get the sleep out of your eyes and smile at life. Let's see who we have here. Let's start with the early shout-outs. For Asa, Jahir, and Crazy, from the Dynasty. For my buddy, Clever from Zapata, he's always around El Encanto every Wednesday and Sunday. We also have one forÂ Chuchis... Okay, Mom. ...Pilokus and the people from the Crazies. For Pekis... Sir, before we get to the mall, can we stop at Bed Bath & Beyond? No! We're not asking you. We're going, that's it. We have to get some Tupperware. Come on, Mom. The sale starts today, by the time we get there, there'll be nothing left. And to the Dragon Crew, And for those from the 7th of November too. We also have a shout-out from the Terkos Lokos, they're saying,Â "Good trip, you know who." Good luck, this shout-out is especially for you. Your people showed up with a large sign just for you, to say goodbye to you and wish you all the luck. Here's some music for you. We hope you like it. Let's go! Tomorrow very early I told you sweetheart Your lover will travel You kept crying Because you can't come with me But I'll keep you in my heart I'll keep you in my heart I'll keep you in my song If you can't come I'll keep you in my heart I'll keep you in my heart I'll keep you here in my song Be smart about this. It's a long process. And here, for some reason, it's better if they take a long time. You know there's no coming back. If you come back and are arrested you'll go straight to jail. You know that? I won't come back. MONTHS LATER Part of the tragedy that we live as Mexicans is due to the fact that we're located at the border of the largest drug consumer in the world and also the largest gun exporter. They pay billions and billions of dollars every year to criminals to provide them with large quantities of drugs. I've given instructions to reinforce the presence of the military in the metropolitan area of Monterrey, at the northeast part of the country. Thank you. The Federal Government. Good morning, people. A beautiful morning, a morning for cumbia. Let's start right away with a song here at Radio 13, the best for vallenata. How I miss my lovelyÂ savanna Stuck at the mountain range Waiting for the time To go back to my homeland To the Pubenza valley I went From all the longing A cumbia blossomed out of my chest Hey, listen, friends! For real! This is not the place to cry. That man always kept moving on. We also have to move on, right, my friends? Right? All the friends of IsaÃ­ know what the deal is. A round of applause for IsaÃ­, shit! What's up, Chucky? Play us a song, come on! At three o'clock I couldn't control my anxiety anymore By the time I realized I had to steal to get it I disappointed everyone I'd burn the bridges myself My will to move up in the world Was already dead I gave my back to God Because I couldn't find answers But of course, from the bad side I did have offers It would also say That it had always been with me That He was always a witness To all our actions That if what I want is peace I could find it in Him That's when I realized I needed Him as a friend Brother! Look at you, Jeremy! I know, bro, but what was I supposed to do? Things are bad here. The Lord called me, so... This is something I'll never regret. Whenever you want, this is your home, you're welcome. No, that's okay. I'm cool. -Are you going to show the money or what? -I'd do it for free even! -Fucking stop, to hell with it. -Fuck yes, dude. It's cool, to hell with it. People stay quiet because they're afraid. They're the victims because they just go into anyone's home, right? Soldiers are mean, they go in your home, steal your property. -When are they going to leave? -When these bastards go back. I want to tell you today That I no longer love you That I no longer miss you I want to tell you today Sincerely-- TERKOS FOREVER Subtitle translation by Yo! It's Jhon, the HCR.

My life is based on drama I don't even know what's the plot I don't know if I should follow advice Or do what my heart wants Scenes of what I should be doing Not even for all the money But be grateful for my errors So I don't fuck up tomorrow I lived through so many things That made my life so painful But I need to get up If I want to survive If there's something I'm certain of And I'll always tell you about If I was the director I'd re-write my script But this is my destiny And It's useless to give up I'm always a soldier And I'll always stay firm I'll always leave my mark For those that want to follow And so the day I die It will all be well worth it I've met actors Which I've regretted later And some extras that caused suffering In quite a few scenes Words and events that will not leave Whether the wind blows or not I feel this movie Is turning into a story I'm no longer here I don't know where I'm going I don't know if it's just consequences Of what I did as a kid But this is my life I don't know if it's right Long live the craziness And long live the Terkos Yes, this is Jonah, HCR, bitches Two, zero, one, nine And a shout-out to my fucking crew The crazy Terkos And a shout-out to my bro, Derek To Pekesillo, to Fer, to Coral To Joselyn, Tania, andÂ Deyanira To Fanny, my buddy Vaisa That's it, dogs It's over
