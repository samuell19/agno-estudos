-[crickets chirping] -[owl hooting] [gun cocks] [crickets chirping] [rustling] You cut through the trees in the left. [crickets chirping] [gun cocks] Billy, you guys all set? -Billy. -Yes, sir. Spit out the damn gum, Billy. Yes, sir. Sorry, sir. [man speaking indistinctly over radio] [man over radio] Sheriff, copy. Over. I read you, Jack. Any sign of life in the house? No, sir. It's dead quiet. We may be too late. Hey, you take it slow and easy there, now. We don't know what we're dealing with. [Jack] Roger. Do you copy, Billy? [Billy] Yes, sir. [Jack] Okay. Everybody, move in. [dramatic music playing] [glass smashes] [gunfire] [explosions] What the hell? Grenades. They've got grenades. [grunts] [man] Tear gas. Let's get out of here. [gunfire] [explosions] Where's the rest of them? [man grunts] [Billy] They're gone. They've got a tunnel leading from under the house. The whole thing's wired. [explosions] [Sheriff] He's taking something. Don't let him swallow. Damn it! Spit it out. Spit it out. -[man groans] -Where's the rest? Where'd they go? Who are you guys? Who are you? We're the future. Oh, God. [choking] Tell Jacobs he better throw a net over this whole area. If these guys get up into the high country, forget it. [suspenseful music playing] Well, I don't see their car. Not that I really expected to. Oh, my God. Look at those mountains. Listen, we're not scaling Everest. We're just going for a little horseback ride, okay? -Come on. -Okay. -Morning. -Good morning. Hi. I hope those riding lessons paid off. Oh. We should go ahead and order, huh? -[Allison] Absolutely. -I'm starving. [Allison] Oh. Me, too. [waitress] Coffee for you this morning? -Yes, please. -[Allison] You bet. We have, uh, two other people joining us. [horn honks] Look at this. She's right on time. -I don't believe it. -Now, this is a first. [both chuckle] Oh, no. Cowboy hats? Cowboy hats? I don't believe it. Yee-haw. Yippie-yi-yo-ki-yay. -[Nita] Oh, no. -[all laughing] -[Connie] Hi, guys. -[Tracy] Hi. Hi, darling. How are you? -Oh, you skinny thing, you. -[Connie] How are you? You look great. You look great. Just gonna go to Cal any day. -Look at this. -Stanford. [all] Stanford? -It was a joke. -I certainly hope so. Sit down. -My God. [laughs] -No more jokes like that. Oh, I'm so glad you came along. So did your mother have to bribe you -or did she drag you along? -Well, she sort of dragged me. I bet she did. You know, you're kind of like our surrogate daughter. Oh, really? I don't remember hearing that when I was changing the old diapers. I changed her diapers. Oh, come on. Please, you guys. You're still seeing Jason? Jason? That was a year ago. -[Nita] No? -Yes. Yeah. Yeah, it really was. It's been that long since we we've all gotten together. Isn't that amazing? I can't believe it's been a year. I-- That's... So, our last meal. Tell me girls, have you all filled out your organ donor cards? -[Connie] Will you stop... -She's been doing this the entire way up here. I can't believe this. Now, this is gonna be great. I'm telling you. I have my, uh, guidebook right here. And this place is so gorgeous. -So how's Tahoe? -It's great. Yeah. It's just I missed you guys so much. Oh, I forgot to call the shop. I knew I was forgetting something. And I'll be right back. That. Is that gorgeous or what? That is the lake where we're going. I want some-- a little enthusiasm please. Excuse me. Do you know where the phone is? -In the bar. -Thanks. She looks great, doesn't she? Well, you know, darling, going through a divorce does give you that certain little smile. -[Connie] Really? -Really. Terrific. [country music playing faintly] [bottle clanks] [dog snarls] [dog barks] Buster, shut up! [dog snarls] Well, go ahead, lady. He won't hurt you. [dog snarls] [woman] Operator, may I help you? [Ding retches] [dog snarls] [Ding retches] [dog snarls] [woman] Operator, may I help you? [dog snarling] Yeah. Yes, operator. Um... And then, he said, "Step on it." [both laughing] -[Connie] Is everything okay? -Oh, fine. -Did you order? -Yeah. -What was that dog barking? -[crash] Oh, mister. I'm sorry. Nita, you devil. How long has this been going on? [Connie chuckles] [Allison chuckles] This guy is so disgusting. [Ding] I don't know what I had to drink last night. Tell me next time, will you? Come on. He ought to let the dog drive. [tires screeching] Oh, that jerk! [chickens clucking] [man] ...there has been raid in which one sheriff's deputy was killed. The four fugitives, all members of the survivalist group, are still at large, and are considered armed and extremely dangerous. Authorities in the Sonoma and Colusa County are conducting a massive manhunt for the four in the western Sierras bordering those counties. More news at 9:00. And now, we're back to Carter's County hits. You could saddle up those pack boxes now, you know. What for? I ain't going anywhere till you get another guy. I got another guy. He ain't gonna make it, Gil. He may have been something once... but he sure ain't nothing now. Saddle up, Bully. [birds chirping] [sighs] -[Ding sighs] -Still drunk, huh? I got this party coming up, you know. And I'm counting on you. I told you about it last night. -They wanna go up to Sky High. -Yeah, not this time, Gil. Hey, I called all over, hunting for another guy -last night, I did. -Oh, like hell. You're trying to work me into this deal ever since I got here. Yeah, but else you got going? Damn it, Ding. The days of cowboying are just about over anyway. You know what Lou Carter's doing now? Working for a mining outfit out of Sheridan. Hell, we're all gonna be working for him pretty soon. -Not me. -[Gil] I know. [laughs] What you got planned? Computer school? Hell, Ding, we're all dinosaurs. When are you gonna get that through your head? [car honks] [sighs] Get your shirt on. We got company. Thank you. -Morning. -[Nita] Hi. -[Gil] How's the trip? -Great. No problems at all. -Are you Gil? -Yes, I am. -Nita Daniels. -How do you do? -This is Allison Shapiro. -Hello. How are you? -Connie Senia... -[Connie] Hi. How are you? -...and Tracy Senia. -[Connie] That's my daughter. Honey, why don't you take this thing off? It's like an implant. Bully, these are the ladies you're gonna be taking up to Sky High. [Nita] Hi there. Uh, Ding. Hey, Ding. Come on out of here. I got some folk I want you to meet. Ding. Ding's one of our passengers. Uh, Gil, can I talk to you a minute? Sure. Excuse me. You got to be kidding. This is a joke, right? They're meeting their husbands up there. It's an easy one-day haul. I'll even get somebody else to bring them back. You get somebody else to take them up. Excuse me. Does this concern us? Well, look, lady, uh, no offense, you know, but I don't think you wanna do this. -Now, hold on. -Why not? Well, it's 15 miles straight up to Sky High. -It's not 15 miles. -As a matter of fact, it's 12 miles. I have the guidebook right here. They rate it moderately difficult. Just moderately difficult. [Ding laughs] You really got the wrong guy here. You shut up. They already gave me a deposit, and I lent half of that to you. Look, I don't know. Maybe he's right. -That's all I'm gonna say. -He's not right. He's hungover. He's the one that doesn't wanna go. I mean, what are we, a bunch of wimps? [Connie scoffs] -Yes. -Yes. You guys. And I swear to God, you blow this, and you and I are quits, you hear me? Now, you're gonna take those gals up to Sky High... and it's gonna be all sunshine and buttercups. Okay. Let's move out. -See you. -[chuckles] [truck engine revving] [indistinct chatter] [Sheriff] Okay. Move. Hold it, Carl. Hold it right there. Just hold it, guys. [engine whirring] [coughs] [sighs] Another day, another dollar, eh, Bob? -Something like that. -What do we got? We're about to find out. They were building something here. Found a lot of scrap lumber and concrete. Smell like there's something underneath it. Yeah. You find out any more about these guys? Yeah. We think they're the same guys that knocked off the National Guard Armory down in Sacramento. There's four of them. All armed to the teeth. Oh, yeah. The Aryan something, uh... [Sheriff] Aryan Survival Brigade. A real sick bunch of boys. They're gonna save the world for us white folks. -Uh, Jack, you ready? -[Jack] Yeah. All right. Look out. Stand back. Dear Lord. [Bob grunting] That's still, uh... He was a park ranger. There's a name tag here. JD... Tabbott, looks like. JD Tabbott. You know him? Yeah. He was the one who went missing a couple of months ago from Cedar Canyon. Hmm. Jack, you better go by the ranger station and break the bad news. Tell them we're gonna be concentrating our search in the Cedar Canyon area now. You're gonna call in the Feds? They'll be coming anyway, why not invite them? See if you can get me a chopper up there. I'm gonna find these guys before somebody else does. [suspenseful music playing] [Bully] Steady. Okay. [dramatic music playing [birds chirping] How you doing, Mom? [horse neighs] I think that's a great idea. [Connie] So glad you're having fun. Come on. Get up. Whoa. [suspenseful music playing] [Bully] Well... This is it, ladies, as far as we go. There must have been an avalanche. -Well, can't we go around that? -Nope. -Why? -Oh, come on. -We've come this far. -[Bully] Yeah. Well, it'll be downhill all the way. -Well, can't at least try it? -[Bully] Nope. We can't. Country's too rough. Now, let's go. There's a track right over here to the left, goes right up the saddle. Well, if it gets too rough, we'll just turn around and come back. Why not? [Tracy] Yeah. What are we, a bunch of wimps? -[Allison] Attagirl, Trace. -[Tracy] All right. [Nita] Come on. [dramatic music playing] [Ding] Stay. [dramatic music playing] [Tracy] Daddy! Daddy! -Daddy! -[shout echoes] [birds singing] Hey, guys, look at this. Maybe they went to the wrong lake. What? Well, look at it. See, this is where they're coming from right along Pacific Crest Ridge here. If they cut down this way, they could have ended up at Lower Sky High Lake. This is it right here-- Lower Sky High Lake? Let me see that. All right. That's it right there. And this is us here. Getting late, ladies. You made up your minds yet? Nita thinks the guys may have gone to Lower Sky High Lake instead. Had a map, didn't they? Yeah, well, maybe they made a mistake. [Bully] Well, you can go have a look if you want to, but we got to get going. We'll be late getting back as it is. [Buster barking] No sign of them. [grunts] [Bully] Well, what's it gonna be, girls, gonna stay here alone or come back with us? I don't think we can do either one. If they show up and we're not here, then what happens? Look, why don't just check Lower Sky High? We'll be happy to pay the extra money. Lady, it's at least four miles down there. It'll be dark by the time we get back. Meaning we'll be stuck here all night with no food, no gear. We've got plenty of food, we've got extra blankets, and we've even got an extra tent. Look, we realize this is a terrible inconvenience for you, so why don't you just tell us how much it's gonna cost for you to spend the night up here, and we can get on with it? Nothing. I'll stay with them. No, you won't. -Why not? -Because I ain't taking all that stuff down there by myself, that's why not. You don't have to, I'll bring the horses down in the morning. I can't do that neither. I got another party going out in the morning. [laughs] I don't think so, boy. [Bully] You don't think so, huh? Nope. Well, it don't matter a damn what you think. Of course, you've been drunk for three days straight, so you ain't thinking right anyhow. Ladies, if you don't wanna stay up here all night, you get your gear together. Now. Look, we don't wanna cause you any trouble, you know. Just find out how much he wants please. All right. You don't need to bother with it, Bully. Don't mess with me, cowboy. Why don't you just go on down alone and tell Gil, uh... I'll bring the horses down in the morning? We're going down now. No, we ain't. It wouldn't be right. I don't wanna fight with you Bully. Let's get out of here, Tracy. Come on. -Get these women ready. -They're not going. [both grunting] -[both grunting] -[horse neighs] [both grunting] I'm gonna break something, cowboy. You're gonna remember me. [both grunting] [Buster growling] [Bully grunting] Get, uh... get your damn dog off me, Ding. Get him off. [Buster growling] [Bully] Let go of me! Let go of me! Easy. Easy. Come on. Come on. Beat it. Get out of here, Buster. Go on. Go on. [Bully groans] [Ding coughs] That's enough. Come on. Get up. Come on. That's enough. [grunts] [Nita] Come on. All right, Bully. You get on that horse and you ride down to Lower Sky High. And if they ain't there, you keep riding, you hear me? Just keep on riding. [groans] [ominous music playing] Why don't you lean back a second. Let me see it. -What? Oh, it's all right. -It's not too good there. Yeah, you might need some stitches when you get home. -I don't think so. -Thanks, honey. -Just like Brian, huh, Mom? -Who's Brian? Ow. My oldest brother. Mom's always patching him up too. She used to be a nurse. Used to be? Did you lose your license? [chuckles] No. I married a pharmacist. Oh. Honey, why don't you get him one of dad's fresh shirts -okay? This one's a little... -It's all right. Aw. -Oh, let me help you with that. -No, no, no, no. Just sit. Just sit, okay? Nita is liberated. You know, she changes her own transmission every week. Thank you. [chuckles] -Where the hell are you from? -Us? We're from the Bay Area, except for Ms. Wilderness Adventurer over here. I have a place in Tahoe. Thank you. What about you? Oh, I'm... kind of in between places. You think that guy is gonna find them down there? Well, if he doesn't, it'd be like you said, they'd missed the trail. That rockslide we passed was dynamited. Knocked the trail marker down. -How do you know that? -I saw it. One of the trees was blown in half. Only thing I can figure is the park service was trying to bring down an avalanche. Yeah. Here we go. Why would they do that? I thought they only dynamited ski areas. So did I. [crickets chirping] [frogs croaking] [Tracy] Whose cooking tonight? [Nita] I thought it was your name I saw in the roster. -[Connie laughs] -[Gil] Here's your shirt. [crickets chirping] [horse neighs] [gunshot] [man screams] [gunshot] [horses neighing] [siren wailing] -[Bob] Bob Clanch. -[Richard] Richard Dukes. [Bob] Come on. -[Richard] So what's the latest? -[Bob] Not much. Except that we've tied these guys into three more disappearances in this county alone. We'll know more tonight. They had this whole area of booby-trapped. Damn near lost one of my men. -[man] Easy. Easy. -[man] I got it. Looks like the stuff they got from the Sacramento armory. Home sweet home for World War III, huh? Is it all here? Nope. Not even half of it. What's this? Predicted fallout patterns for the western United States. We'd like our own lab to look after this if it's all right with you. As long as you keep me informed. What's Iron Nest? I heard one of your men say something about an Iron Nest. That's what they call their mountain stronghold. It's probably where they're headed, where the rest of the stuff is stashed. We figured it's got to be in this area somewhere. Hell. You're talking about a thousand square miles of country out there. [Richard] And now all we got to do is find them. [dramatic music playing] [horse neighs] Yeah. A fence is as hard on a cowboy's future as anything though. As long as there are cows, there'll be cowboys. But as soon as a man knows where all his cattle are, they won't need cowboys. [Nita] So what then? That's what I'm trying to figure. [dramatic music playing] Well... Thank you. You got to move into the 20th century, I guess. Hmm. If it's any comfort to you, I'm not that crazy about the 20th Century myself. -I run an antique shop. -Antiques, huh? -Uh-hmm. -Hmm. -Any market for a used cowboy? -Keep my eyes open. -[Tracy] Come on. Come on. -[Buster barks] [Tracy] Here you go. Come on. Come on. -[Buster barks] -[Tracy] Sit up. Good dog. Good dog. [chuckles] Look at this. Buster loves corn chips. You better watch him. -Does he bite? -[Ding] No. He steals. -[Tracy] Hey, Buster, no. -Taught him well. [Tracy] Come here. Give to me, Buster. Thank you. [chuckles] -Aw. -Honey, come on. I don't want the dog in here. Oh, Tracy take him out of here, please. -Come on. Come on. -Come on. Get your children out of here, Connie. [Tracy] Come on. Let's go. -[sighs] -[laughs] She's so beautiful, you know. -[sighs] The dog? -No, your daughter. My daughter? Yes. She's great-looking. But I could strangle her sometimes, you know that? Oh. -You know what? -What? I just spilled this all over the bag. I'm sorry. It is gonna smell like a cathouse in here. Oh, that's all right with me. You know how Jackie is when he gets back from these things. -He's an animal. -Yeah. Jim too. Why do you think I have Tracy sleeping with me, huh? Oh, you devil you. [laughs] You know I really think it is the hunting thing. It's so basic. The men go off in the woods, stalking these helpless trout. -Their beards growing. -And the women? The women are back at the camp. -Right. The waiting harlots. -[Connie] That's right. Those harlots are bathing themselves in perfume, -just praying for razor burn. -Right. -And the coup de grace. -Oh. Look at this. Boom like boom like a boom, boom, boom. -It should do the trick? -Yes, it should. [laughs] Well, well, well. Nita and Ding certainly seem to be hitting it of okay. Oh, come on. Give me a break. What's wrong with that? That's a guy who saved her honor, you know. Yeah. Well, two years from now I don't wanna be moving her stuff out of a barn somewhere. Don't be so negative. With a love of a good woman, you never know. [Bully] Ding! [Ding] Did you hear someone calling? It sounded like my name. [dramatic music playing] [Nita] Is it them, huh? [Ding] I don't know. It sounded like Bully to me. [Buster growling] What is it? [growling] Easy, boy. Easy. Ding, what is it? We've got something coming. Give me the flashlight. Well, is it them or not? I don't think so. Stay here. [horse neighing] Whoa. Whoa, boy. Ding? [ominous music playing] [Ding] It's Bully's horse. -What happened? -[Ding] It's been shot. Come on. We're getting out of here. Well, what do you think happened? I don't know. I don't know, but I heard two gunshots. Now, I want you to get your jackets and flashlights. And douse the lanterns. -Wait. What about the guys? -We'll worry about them later. -Tracy? Tracy? -But maybe it was an accident. It was no accident. And neither was that trail marker at down below. -Now, uh... -[Connie] Tracy? Nita, douse that fire. I'm gonna saddle our horses. [Nita] Tracy? -What's wrong? -Honey, go up to your mom. Hurry up. Come on. Mom, what's wrong? What's going on? Where is you jacket? I just-- I just saw it on you a few minutes ago. I can't find my damn flashlight. It's here. It's out here. Here it is. Will you put this on, honey, because we're gonna get out of here. -Why? -Because somebody is coming. -That's why. -Who? I don't know. I don't know. Just come on. Come on. Hurry up. Let's go. Let's go. [Bully] No. No. Please. For God's sake. [suspenseful music playing] [Buster barking] [Ding] Somebody give me a hand down here? [Buster barking] [Ding] Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! What are you doing? [Ding] They'll be on us any minute. Maybe they'll follow the horses if I let them go. Hyah! -[Nita] Who'll be onto us? -[Ding] The guy that shot Bully. Hyah! Hyah! Come on. Hyah! Hyah! -All right. Let's go. Let's go. -What's happening? -Forget your horses. Move it. -Forget it? We're getting out of here. Hurry up. Move. Go on. [Nita] Who do you think they are? [Nita] I don't know, poachers, crazies. Go on. Come on. Go, go, go. -[Ding] Get up. -[Nita] Go on. [gunshots] [horse neighing] They're killing the horses. [gunshot] Go on. Keep moving. [gunshot] [horse neighing] [birds squawking] [suspenseful music playing] [Buster barks] Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Easy. Come on. Easy. All right. There you go. ♪ Now, I'm standing all alone... ♪ [telephone ringing] Big Owen Pack Station. Gil. [Jim] Hey, Gil, this is Jim Senia. Where are you guys? I sent your wives up this morning. [Jim] We're down at Sacramento. We got lost up there, Gil. How did you get lost? [Jim] Well, there were no signs up there. Nothing. No. No. There's got to be. [Jim] Well, there was nothing, Gil. No. They don't open up an area unless they put up trail markers. -[Jim] Are you sure? -That's right. [Jim] Well, Jack broke his ankle climbing down. You're kidding. How bad did it broke? [Jim] He's in a cast. -In a cast? -[Jim] That's right. -The whole thing? -[Jim] The whole works. Damn. [Jim] When are the girls coming back out? Well, that depends on how long they're gonna sit around up there waiting for you. [Jim] They're not coming back down alone, are they? Oh, no, no, no. My boys will be with them. Yeah. [Jim] About what time do you figure? Oh, sometime in the afternoon, I guess. [Jim] Around 3:00 or so? Yeah. -[Jim] Well, look after them. -Oh, sure I will. -[Jim] We'll get back to you. -Right. -[Jim] Bye-bye. -Bye. Damn. Damn. Damn. [birds chirping] [water gushing] Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Hurry up. That's right. Come on. Come on. [Buster barking] [birds chirping] [water gushing] [sighs] Uh, ladies you go up to the trees and work your way down to the water. [breaths heavily] What about you? I'll stay here and make sure nobody is following us. Uh, Buster? Buster? Go on up. Follow them. [Buster barking] Oh, boy. [sighs] Ding, are you all right? Yeah. Yeah. -You don't look very good. -[chuckles] I never looked too good. This is about as good as it gets. Now, you go on with the rest of them. I'll be along. I'll take this. Oh, boy. [ominous music playing] [birds squawking] [twig snaps] [gasps] [water splashes] [suspenseful music playing] [both grunting] [screams] [grunting] [birds chirping] Well, he couldn't have just disappeared? Well, there is no sign of him. [Nita] Maybe his body is trapped under the falls. [Ding] No. That's coming from the top. I suppose downstream. [suspenseful music playing] [bird squawking] [birds chirping] [sighs] It's right in here. It's sounded like a CB radio. -That's always not too bad. -Oh, God. I hope he's right about the guys. They're probably at Lower Sky High. Probably still waiting for us. Here he comes. You know, if he didn't see anything, I think we ought to stay right here. I don't know. I think somebody ought to go with him. He's in worse shape than we are. Look at him. He's got the shakes. [sighs] Is that okay for us so far, Connie? I'm not saying that he hasn't, but look at him. Well, how is it? We'll be all right? Yeah. I think so. I could see about a half mile upstream No one's coming. Oh, thank God. You think anyone is looking for us yet? I keep getting this voice on my radio. I doubt it. How far do you think it is down to the pack station? Ten, fifteen miles, but it's gonna be bushwhacking all the way. So, you think you can make it? Yeah. I can make it. But it's a hell of a way to sober up, if that's what you're thinking. [Nita] It's not what we're thinking. Well, it's your call. You want me to go for help, I better be leaving. So you want me to go? Yeah. I think we do. Fair enough. I better be going. Ding, look, you have a say in this too. -You don't have to go. -Yeah, I do. Well, would you like me to go with you? No. No. Come here, Buster. How long do you think it's gonna take you? All day. Maybe all night. Look, you know, you've been a real hero in this whole thing. -I want you to know... -Yeah. Yeah. I'm serious. You really have. You really have. I'm gonna cover our tracks down there just to be safe. You keep the axe. All right? Here. You just keep your chin up, kiddo. I'll have them fly in some corn chips for you, all right? Yeah. -All right? -Yeah. Okay. All right. Bye. Come on, Buster. Come on. Be careful, Ding. Bye, Buster. [Buster barks] [birds chirping] [Phil] Jack, this is Phil. Come in. Yeah, Phil, go ahead. [Phil] Dogs have lost the scent. What do we do? Keep running them up at the canyon. How far up does it go? All the way to Stallworth's Pass. [Phil] Jack? Hold on. Yeah, Phil? [Phil] Search and rescue are reporting missing campers in the Evolution Divide area. Women, four of them, and two packers. Where the hell is Evolution Divide? Hold on, Phil. I think it's on the eastern side of the range. Yeah. Here it is. Here. It goes right across Stallworth Pass. That's it. -That's where it's got to be. -[Jake] What? Iron Nest. [panting] [birds chirping] [suspenseful music playing] [gasps] [explosion] [suspenseful music playing] [grunts] [Buster barking] [Buster whines] [static] It's right in here somewhere. Well, maybe it was just a radio station. It wasn't. It was real loud. [Buster barking] [Nita] Did you hear that? What? Honey, turn that down. What was it? I don't know. [man talking indistinctly over radio] [Connie] Nita, we've got something. [man talking indistinctly over radio] -It comes and goes. -Probably just a station. No. No. I think she's right. It's not a station. It's a CB signal. Maybe it's a search party. Maybe it's not. [man] ...I can't see anything. I'm coming to... Come here. Go up top. See if there's any difference. [man] Okay. Bring them down. Are the batteries okay? Yeah. I changed them just before we left. [Connie] Well, if it is a search party, they'd have to be pretty close, wouldn't they? I mean, a regular radio doesn't pick up CB signals. [man talking indistinctly over radio] Honey, try turning upstream a little bit. [man] Let me know when you get there? Over. [man] Yeah. We're breakin' up in here. I can barely read you. Over. Turn it down for a second. Listen. [Buster barking] -It's Buster. -Yeah. Turn it up. [man] We've got contact. They're still ahead of me. I can hear the dog. [man] I got them. You stay where you are. It's them. Come on. Come on. They got walkie-talkies. Hurry up. [suspenseful music playing] Okay. Well, maybe, they'll just go right by us. Maybe we can just hide here. [Buster barking] -Shh. -Buster, stay. Buster. Buster, shh. -No, stop. -Buster. Buster. He's gonna lead them right to us. It's okay. They're coming. Nita, they're coming. -I know. I know, okay? -[cries] [suspenseful music playing] [birds chirping] [groans] [clatter] [Buster barks] Ding. Oh, boy, am I glad to see you? What happened? What happened? We gotta get out of here. There was a trap up there. We were walkin' right into them. No. They're behind us. We picked them up on Tracy's little radio. They've got walkie-talkies. They've been following us the whole night. If they're coming this way then-- that broken trail marker said Bitter Creek. This has got to be it. -They're coming. -Come on. Let's go. [grunts] [water gushing] [birds chirping] Shh. [man] They couldn't have gone back up but they're probably ahead of me, down on the forest somewhere. Over. Well, I got to get this guy before his friends get here. I want all of you to get down to the water, -find a place to hide. -What about you? Well, I'm gonna try to get this guy. Sic Buster on him, then I'll try to nail him myself. [man on radio] They're right above the gravel bed. So let's move in. Like I promised you, Wolfe, we keep two of them. They've got us trap in here. What are we gonna do? Maybe you can climb out. [suspenseful music playing] You think these are the same guys that killed those people in Sacramento? We know they're the same guys. I hope to God I'm wrong about this. No kidding. You ever ridden in a chopper before? [suspenseful music playing] [frogs croaking] [water flowing] [helicopter blades whirring] [suspenseful music playing] [grunts] [suspenseful music playing] [Nita screams, gasps] [suspenseful music playing] [Nita grunting] [screams] [Tracy] Oh, Mom. [ominous music playing] [panting] [cries] [ominous music playing] Ding. Ding! Oh, Ding! [ominous music playing] [gun cocks] [screams] [man] Okay. Where are they? Where are they? [Buster barks] [gunshot] [Buster whines] [suspenseful music playing] [grunts] [gunshot] [groans] [Buster whining] Oh, Ding. Ding. Not this time, Nita. Right in the gut. God, I don't know what to do. [groans] [helicopter blades whirring] [man] Sheriff! It's got to be them. We found the horses down below. They've been shot. Shot? All of them? Yeah. Even the pack horses. Why would they kill the horses? To keep them from going down the mountain, and because they like it. [helicopter blades whirring] [crickets chirping] [water gushing] [crickets chirping] [groans] They're right above us. Give me that gun, Nita. [Connie] There's another one. They're on both sides of the river. Let me-- Let me handle this. Get over there behind the rock. Nita, uh, I can't aim. [water gushing] [gun cocks] [water gushing] [Ding groans] He hasn't seen where we are yet. We're better off in the water. We got to move. Tracy. Tracy, come here. Come on, honey. Come on. Hold on. Hold on. -[groans] -Come on. [groans] -[grunts] -[Nita] Come on. Okay. Okay. Come on. [screaming] [Nita screams] [Nita] Ding? Ding? Get him up. Get him up. Pull up his head. [coughing] [Tracy groans] Oh, God. [Connie] Honey, are you all right? [sobs] Mom. Let me see. Here. Here. No, don't touch it. No. No. It's okay. It's all right. It's okay. -Ow! Don't. -I'm sorry, sweetie. I'm sorry. [coughs, groans] [Connie] Nita. Nita, come back here. Let's get out of here. -I lost my gun. -Forget the gun. He is coming back! Nita. Nita, come on. Help me with him. We gotta keep going. [gun cocks] -[gunfire] -[bullets ricochet] [grunts] [Ding pants] [Allison] What's he doing? [Nita] I don't know. Oh, what the hell is this? Oh, God. There's another one. -Stay put. -No. Get out of here. [Ding] Stay put. [Connie] Allison, get back here. Get out of here. Get back upstream. Go on. Go. [Ding coughs] [frogs croaking] [panting] Allison! Allison! [groans] [Connie] Ding, Ding, Ding. Come on. Come on. -Go on. -No, no, no. Come on. Let's go. Come on. [screams] [grunts, screams] Who is that? Must be the guy we got with the axe. -[Nita] What's that? -[Allison] Grenade. [Nita] Someone's coming. -Oh, hide. -[Allison] Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. There you go. [Ding groans] Give me the grenade. [gunfire] [explosion] Someone get his gun. [frogs croaking] [Wolfe] I know that. I know that. I want you to get him. Just shut up and hold your position up there. You hear me? And stay off the radio. [man] I can find them, Wolfe. I can move in there and waste them one by one. [Wolfe] I said hold your position. We'll take them at first light. Then you can do anything you want to do with them. You hear me? Anything you want. They're all yours. [frogs croaking] [Nita] What did you do with the gun? The explosion blew it apart. Tracy? What's this? Oh, great. Why don't you give me that? How bad is it? Well, I don't know, but he sure lost a lot of blood. What? What? Where are they? Where are they? -Shh, shh, shh. -[Ding] I thought we were in the store. No. No. We're just in the mountains. [muttering] God, I can't believe I lost that gun. I can't believe that happened. Somebody has to be looking for us. -How about that chopper? -They're not coming back until the morning, so they can see it's light. Well, then what the hell are we gonna do? We're gonna hide and we're gonna pray. -That's what we're gonna do. -No. We've got to be ready to try something. What do you mean? [Nita] We saw four of them coming to the camp, right? That means that there's only two left. There's one upstream and one downstream. What are you getting at? We got to try and get one of their guns. [Allison] That's crazy. It's not crazy. It's the only thing we can do. We can hide. We can cover ourselves up. And if they find us, they'll kill us. Maybe not. Allison, for God's sake, they will kill us. They are planning to come in here tomorrow and kill us one by one. Tomorrow we die. Do you understand that? [Tracy sobs] I'm so, uh-- look, all I'm trying to say is we've got to be ready to try something. Maybe they will find us. Maybe they're looking for us right now. But if one of those guys finds us first... we've got to try something or we're dead. What do you have in mind? We kill the first guy that comes in here. [suspenseful music playing] [frogs croaking] -Hey, how you doing? -I've been better. Tracy, listen, we found a place for you to hide, okay? I want you to come with me right now. Come on. Come on. -Any sign of Buster out there? -No. I've been holding out on you though. No. You got the wrong guy. I'm supposed to be the hero around here, remember? [chuckles] All right. [Connie] Oh, yeah. I'm gonna cover you up, all right? And I want you to stay here no matter what happens. All right? No matter what happens. Promise? Oh, Tracy, I really love you, you know? We're not gonna die, Mom. We're not gonna die. Oh, sweetie. -[sobs] -It's okay. [Nita] Which one do you want? -Allison? -I can't do this. I just can't. -But you have to. -I can't, it's not in me. I can't. [Ding] I'll take the axe. [Nita] You know what we're gonna try? Yeah. -What do you think? -It depends. -[Nita] On what? -On whether or not you have to kill anyone. I don't mean just wound. But if he gets in close, you got to have to kill him. Are you up to that? [birds chirping] Ready? Okay. Move in. [birds chirping] Doyle, can you read me? Doyle, I need help. Doyle, where are you? [birds chirping] [squirrel chitters] [footsteps] [Ding] Doyle, do you hear me? Doyle? [suspenseful music playing] [gunfire] [groans] [screams] [grunting] [gunfire] [groans] Wolfe. I'm dead, Wolfe. [suspenseful music playing] [gunfire] [groans] [gunfire] [groans] [screams] [suspenseful music playing] [grunts] [gunfire] [groans] [helicopter blades whirring] Hold it. I got something here. It's them. I got one... two... I got three bodies down there. There's another one over here. Looks like a war down there. Who the hell took these guys out anyway? Hey, Bob, look. Smoke. [helicopter blades whirring] Get mountain rescue here right away. [dramatic music playing] [Buster barking] It's Buster. It's Buster! [Buster whining] Oh, Buster. [Buster whining] Ding. Ding. Ding, it's Buster. We got Buster. [sobs] [sobs] Buster. [chuckles] [dramatic music playing] [helicopter blades whirring] [dramatic music playing] Bye, Ding. Bye, Buster! [dramatic music playing]
