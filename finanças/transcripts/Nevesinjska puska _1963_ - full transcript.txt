Its power could not be stopped by the secret machinations of the Great Powers, nor the narrow-minded calculations of the national dynastic rivalry. The fight started by the "NEVESINJE Gun" yielded many great heroes; this film cannot even mention them all: Through the destiny of one of them we wanted to show the efforts of many. RAGUSA Dubrovnik Gentlemen. The reputation of the many world's papers which you represent obliges me to thoroughly inform you about the miserable situation of the Christians in my Homeland and the need for an armed insurrection, which we wish to start. You see, gentlemen... This is Herzegovina. From here, from Dubrovnik, it is only a 20 km bumpy road away. And four centuries of slavery under the Ottoman Empire. I ask you, for its sake to aid it with your articles. Mr. LJUBIBRATIĆ. How do you envision Herzegovina once it’s released from the Turks? It seems to me, Mr. Stilman, that for 12 years that's all I think about. That's just what I’m talking about. In short, we wish to be entirely free. To make Herzegovina a democratic state, and enlightened. For example, these books are designated for our first schools, which our people long for. Mr. Marković will run the schools. Excuse me, Mr. Ljubobet, Ljubobat... LJUBIBRATIĆ. LJUBIBRATIĆ. I am interested in the politics. Who will help you out? Do you really plan to wage war against the entire Turkish empire? Mr. Rabion, do you really think Serbia and Montenegro will deny us their help? Two of our countries, which already freed themselves from the Turks? What, the entire Christian Europe will stay indifferent? In other words, Mr. LJUBIBRATIĆ, you rely on the moral sense of the Free and Christian? That is, to put it mildly, an unreliable touchstone. Sorry to interrupt. I am late for the meeting because I was waiting for some urgent messages for you. Hopefully, there's no need to hide these messages in front of your colleagues. Allow me to introduce you to the gentlemen. Mr. William Stilman, the “London Times” correspondent. Mr. Rabion from the Parisian "Tam". Mr. Nemeček, Prague "Novosti". And Mr. Aldolazaro, Neapolitan newspaper "Fanfulla". Mr. Mathias Reiner, the "Wiener Zeitung" correspondent. Could we now hear your urgent message, Mr. Reiner. I took it upon myself to make you aware of this in time to avoid trouble. Mr. LJUBIBRATIĆ, You are to leave Dubrovnik today. You mean... Austria is denying me the right to asylum? It hasn't denied it yet. But now, when your activities provoke disturbances in Turkey... that is... Disturbance? Those disturbances are an uprising, Mr. Reiner. And we are only in the making of an uprising. Your uprising, which my government still has to treat as disturbances, has already started. Look. Yesterday, around NEVESINJE the first gun was fired. What? You are surprised, Mr. LJUBIBRATIĆ? Surprised. A better surprise I could not imagine, Mr. Reiner. Gentlemen! The next time we see each other will be on the battlefield. In Herzegovina! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Don't shoot the monastic sheep. Damn you! MIĆO! Should I shoot too? - In vain, Ilija. - Oh well. MIĆO! Here come the Croatian troops. - Good to see you, Musić. - You too, MIĆO. Where have you been, Captain? Don't get comfortable, Musić. If you brought an army to fight, prepare immediately. Hold up, Captain. We agreed to wait for all troops to gather. Didn't you say this monastery is stuck in our craw? It cuts us off from Upper Herzegovina. That's exactly why, Captain, we shouldn't just shoot aimlessly. The Turks have a gun to our heads, and we can't even see their fezzes. MIĆO! If we had waited at NEVESINJE for all the arms to gather, and for you to arrive from pretty Dubrovnik, the NEVESINJE gun would not yet have fired. Help! Help us, brethren. Those are the priests. They will kill them! The Turks will kill them! There is the father hegumen calling for help. People! People! You call yourself Christians? Save the holy brethren. The Turks will slaughter them! People! Oh, God save us! Run, my boy. Don't look at that. Brethren! Brethren! Brethren! You call yourself Christians? Are you Christians?? Don't just sit, while the Turks slaughter the priests. Our Father, Who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name. Thy kingdom come... MIĆO, I can't just stand here and watch this in front of these people! They will pay for this! I promise you that! Boys! Get ready! Forward! Forward! Well, that's one mean attack! It’s in vain. Half of his troops will get killed. We can't leave him alone. Lead your troop. People! After me! To the monastery! Forward! Forward! Men! Death to the non-Christians! Death to the non-Christians! Forward! Boys, all with me! Hurrah! Forward! Tell Musić and the Captain to go back. We will come with. Captain. Get back. MIĆO will go. Get back, boys. Back! Back, boys! Back! Get back, back! Go back, boys! Back! Oh! My poor Mika! - Brave eagle! - Hero, where to now? How will your mother... Musić! MIĆO! Does your troop have clean cloths and bandages for the poor souls in my troop? We will give you bandages right away, Captain. Did you see? Oh, poor me. Six death and 30 wounded. We weren't lucky. We weren't united, Captain. We can't attack whenever we feel like it. We must have a single order. Mr. LJUBIBRATIĆ, I have to protest! - It is unheard of! - But why the protest, Mr. Reiner! We have wonderful material on our first report from Herzegovina. What happened, Mr. Reiner? You don't know we have been robbed, Mr. LJUBIBRATIĆ? You invited us here. And I feel free to say, Mr. LJUBIBRATIĆ, you are responsible for our safety. You failed, and I am obliged to inform my government. - Oh, Mr. Stillman! - It's very awkward, dear friend. Just as we crossed the border, a mob was waiting. They robbed us of our money, rings and all our valuables. Petar-Chief! Luckily, he let them live! That could only have been Petar-Chief! - You told him you came by my request? - He didn't believe... He teased us. He said: You'd forgive him because the money is for a good cause. Gentleman, all your belongings will be returned to you. Or justly compensated for. I ask you to consider this unfortunate case closed, and... Good evening! Mr. LJUBIBRATIĆ! Allow me to introduce our lovely companion from Dubrovnik... My name is Jeanne Merkus. You may call me Jenny. I am responding to your call, and I wish to volunteer. You should be highly honored to get this volunteer, mister. Miss Merkus is the daughter of the previous general governor of East India. Miss... I have already written about your arrival in my papers. It's incredible news! The whole Europe will speak only of you! The first woman-volunteer in Herzegovina! The Dutch Amazon, Jenny Merkus! It's good to have you here. I thought I would never see you again. When you left Rome, I was lost for days. Everything was lonely without you. I went home to the Netherlands, and I couldn't be there, either. Jenny! Dubrovnik is only 20 kilometers away from here. You'll go back there. No, Michel. When it quiets down, we'll see each other. Twenty kilometers or 200, it's the same, Michel. I want to be with you. Jenny, people are dying. You can't stay here. - I can't stay anywhere. Only with you. - Jenny! People here are vicious. They will mock. I'm an official volunteer, no one can turn me down! I will stay with you. That's all I care about. MIĆO! This heroine is still boring you? She wants to fight, huh? Ilija, I don't know what to do with her. If you allow me, I'll show you what to do. Let her stay with the hospital. I'll take her. And you get ready for a trip. You'll send a message. Fine, MIĆO. Peko! Welcome! Vuko! Be in good health, Peko Pavlović! Hero of Čevo! Hello, MIĆO. May your saber shine! How many people did you bring? They are there. But do mind, that we are not an army, but volunteers. We can no longer bear this. How so? Didn't the prince send you? He allowed us to come. He'll allow the other troops, when they gather. All Montenegro rose to help you! But you know, he's careful, he wants to do it secretly, he doesn't want to wage war with the Sultan. May the Lord be on our side, Montenegrins! Lord, help! The Turks didn't see you? No, with God help. We were quiet, step by step. - As you asked. - That's good. Excuse me, Reverend, we are using the quiet to talk to the leaders of the troops. - Our papers wanted to… - Gentlemen, start with the others. Today I am busy as a priest. Two fighters have died. Two kids need to be Christened. Where is the cross, for God's sake? Did somebody steal it? It should be here, Reverend Ivan. It shouldn't be lost. There's the dynamite, Reverend. And the other day we couldn't find it. You look for the cross, I need it now. If you don't find it, I'll put a spear through you! Help is arriving for the Turks. Run away from here! What was I saying, Reverend, here it is! Everyone, go for the hills. Get away from the monastery. Come on! Run, people, run! Help is arriving for the Turks. Run away from the monastery. Milica, we need to move the wounded, there! Come on people, go! Go! Go! Get up! Do you think the Turks will make a mistake? Oh, yes! Just hit them harder! Now go, eagles. Forward! Forward! Hurrah! Let's go, brave men! Forward! Forward! Forward! All with me! Forward! Hurrah! Take their heads off, brethren. All of them! Take them! Hit, what are you waiting for? Kill them! Non-Christians! Kill them! Stop! People! They dropped their weapons! Don't kill them, people! They dropped their weapons! It's the enemy, even if they drop them 100 times! I told you to stop fencing! Who are you to order us!? Will we let them go, when we have them? Do you hear me? They surrendered! Do you hear me? It's the enemy! We will no longer take heads off. This is no longer a stupid, outlaw war in the gorges and night ambushes. Listen, LJUBIBRATIĆ! Don't insult the old heroes! They knew how to fight in these mountains. And I learned from them! I'm insulting no one, Captain. But a new time has come! Today we are fighting before the eyes of all Europe! Sodom! Sodom and Gomorrah! Deluded brethren! Deluded brethren! The Lord said: Pour indignation on your enemy and let the fire of your wrath burn them! And you? You release the Turks from the vengeful sword? And you give them monastic bread to eat? Tell me first: Why are you wearing that monastic dress? Okay, MIĆO. Let him go. Why are you resting your hand and your fist? Raise your hand and destroy your enemy! Oh, shut it! Beat it! Brethren! Instead of arguing about the Turkish heads, choose your leader and Duke. It's time. You're right, Peko. Upper-Herzegovina chooses its Duke. It’s time to lower our hats before our own Duke! - I think it should be MIĆO. - Don't jump to that, Musić. Others are asking too. Why MIĆO? Why? His eyes have seen the world, so he should still write decrees. Let him deal with politics! - But he will not lead an army! - Today he led an army wisely. People! We need a Duke's steady hand. And one Commander. But so there is no fight between us, we will call and ask for all the heads of Southern-Herzegovina. - Let them decide, too! - Amen! Monastic bells. They weren't heard for centuries. Bells in Herzegovina. Stop! Where to? Who are you? I'm Duke LJUBIBRATIĆ! And you? I'm asking the questions here! And you answer! Or we'll shoot again! You won't be alive for long! It's them. What are you here for? I am looking for Petar-Chief. Get down and come closer, so I can see you better. Come on. Atta boys! So, a Duke, you say. So come, Duke, forward! Just you. You'll be the first Duke to set foot in Peter-Chief's lair. But fear not. The Chief awaits you. Come in! Good afternoon, Petar-Chief. Good to see you, MIĆO. Don't be insulted that I'm not getting up. - My feet are tired, I'm resting them. - It's fine. Come on, give us some wine, don't skimp. Oh, Prdekrio! Yes, Chief? Sing us our heavenly song. - Don't you see we have a guest? - Right away, Chief! To your health, MIĆO! Or am now I to call you Duke? Call me as you please. You're not asking why I'm here. And why are you? Because of the heavenly song you stole from the journalists. I'll give them the bag, MIĆO. I didn't take it for myself. I wanted to help you. Oh yeah, you're helping me. Isn't money needed for an uprising? - It is, Petar. - To buy guns? To buy gunpowder and bullets… - Yes, Petar. - You see. For you, I'll get back on the road. If I come across any salesmen, money will be pouring out of the bags. What, MIĆO? I said something rude? I am younger than you, Petar. I don't wish to preach. But you should know that in this uprising, we will not plunder caravans! Do you think, Miša, that there is someone who will stop me and forbid me to do things I have always done? If no one else will, Petar, I will stop you. - You? - Aha. Do you hear this, my eagles? Law and order came to Herzegovina! What? Have you all had a good laugh? If not, listen up. I wasn't searching all day for you just because of the robbed journalists. Petar. Listen up. The uprising is calling. Take your arms, all of us, under one sign. This time we will all fight together and stand united. Not as each pleases. If you do not agree, I bid you a goodbye. There are already those who do not agree, because we ask for a lot. Freedom, and law, and education. But we can do it all if we are united. Oh, that’s a tall story. A pipe dream! Get the hell out. What are you waiting for? I want to talk to him in peace. MIĆO. My dear LJUBIBRATIĆ, I am sending you three troops of volunteers. I am sorry that, due to sickness and old age, I can't personally assist you in the uprising. May justice be served, and the Lord's strength be by your side. Yours truly, Garibaldi. Karlo. You couldn't have brought me better news. I will write him immediately and thank the old man. The soldiers are waiting for you. They are tired. It was hard to march all the way here. Sir Duke! There are two of us. - Which one do you need? - You, Duke. But I can say this to you both. The volunteers I brought from Serbia, are are some sort of an advance. His royal Highness said: More help will come when you ask for annexation of Herzegovina to Serbia. Should I consider this as your joke, or a joke of His Highness? As far as I'm concerned, I would consider it a joke, Duke. But His Highness has already sent a portrait of his. Here. So you'd have it when you become a province of Serbia. What is it, Peko? You're in a good mood, I do not wish to spoil it. The same message came from Cetinje. The Prince said: Herzegovinians, annex to Montenegro. But he did not send a portrait, but a bag full of Montenegrin emblems. Now, even if we wanted to, which empire should we join? Both wish to spread their power. And now, how to comply... with both? - What will you do, MIĆO? - What can I do? If there is an ounce of empathy, both will still help us out. Hopefully, the Lord will aid us in our fight. Herzegovinians alone will choose their country’s destiny. Captain! Sir Duke! The Foreign Legion volunteers in Herzegovina are at your service. At your disposal are Garibaldi soldiers, volunteers from Germany, France, and Britain. And one fighter from the Netherlands. That's a total of 201, at your disposal. Velimir Kostić, Lieutenant from Kragujevac. Troop of volunteers from Serbia. Sergeant Miroslav Gudmajer from Ljubljana. The troop of volunteers from Slovenia, Croatia and Dalmatia is waiting for your order. Vladimir Petrovich Kuznetsov. Under my command are volunteers from Russia, Poland, and Czechia. Brethren! You came from everywhere, many different countries. But you all came here for one nobility, one altruism of Christian Europe. Hurrah! That was a nice speech, Sir Duke. But, it's as though you forgot what brought me here from altruistic, Christian Europe! I didn't forget, Jenny. I don't know. We don't see each other for several days. Jenny! I'm serious. I am very busy, that's all. That's not all. This morning I wanted to run away. Run away? I couldn’t do it anymore. Everything you told me. Marching on this stone is killing me. I have nowhere to wash my face. I sleep on a straw bed. Why don't you go down to Dubrovnik? I'm ashamed. When everyone here can endure, even all those women… why can’t I? And I will endure, dammit. Just… promise you won't leave me alone. I promise. Excuse me, Sir Duke. I don't mean to cause panic. But there is a shared opinion here, that the way you are leading the uprising will have catastrophic consequences. That is serious, Duke. They say you don't get along with people. That things went wrong from the start. That in Herzegovina, your political ideas cannot be fulfilled. And that you will not stay here until the end. But if you listen to me, maybe something can be done. Well, Mr. Reiner. Sir Duke, before anything else, I'm a journalist. But, this time, if you'd allow, I will give you an official message of my government. - I hope, you will not resent it. - Oh, on the contrary. We are very grateful to the Austro-Hungarian government that it allowed volunteers to travel across its territory. Well, that's just the thing. We are ready to help the uprising even more, and yourself personally. Under the conditions… Sir Duke, I hope that I don't need to stress that in politics, every help has its price. Mr. Reiner, we will better manage with all our cards on the table. Very well… So, the message. Firstly, You would be proposed as Premier of the autonomous Herzegovinian government. Secondly, your movement would enjoy the wholehearted help of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. And all this, of course, with a special price. Which is acceptable, even more so, very acceptable. The only thing is, you would be the head of a group of Herzegovinian leaders that goes to Vienna and asks the Austro-Hungarian Kingdom and Empire to protect insurgent provinces in Herzegovina. So that's how it is. You want to invade us? You cunningly planned that the uprising gets out of hand just so you could say: "The Balkan killing can only be placated and stopped by us." Pardon. Excuse me, Sir Duke. Don't haste. I'm sorry, but I must warn you that your refusal could have very uncomfortable consequences for your uprising and yourself. Very great consequences. Think about it. You can let me know. I have nothing to say to you. I said it all, Mr. Reiner. Feel free to forward it to Vienna. We will never agree to that, that you protect us. Good afternoon to all the heroes and cowards. Dukes and Dukes' lap dogs. You all put up a good fight for freedom and the people's wealth but you think of your pockets and bellies. You look for some sour milk and wait for other people’s widows. May the Herzegovinian God bless you all! I wish you well, Chief! If you came for robbery, get back on the road where Turks and merchants pass through. On the road, there are no Turks, nor merchants, my Duke. Because everyone fears your NEVESINJE gun. But accept in your fold an honest outlaw troop. We will be useful, if it comes to running away. You're a savage, Chief. It would be easier to say our hellos, Petar, if you weren't on a horse. Take me off the horse. What are you waiting for, bastards? Peko-Hero! Welcome, Petar-Chief. MIĆO! Everyone says that you are preparing a Herzegovinian government, where you'll be the Prime Minister! Me, a Prime Minister? That's just talk, Petar. If we are honest, I could be Minister of Finance because I must have gained some experience with all my outlawing. Good day to you to, European gentleman. Forgive me for that introduction on the road. An entire country makes a mistake, robs people, let alone a single man. - But I give it all back, as promised. - Giving things back? Him? - Is his sick, God forbid? - MIĆO! Here are my outlaws, as you asked for. And some volunteers. Truth be told, until they decided to come, we had to give them a push. - And even ignite some houses. - You mean, that was your heroic deed, a couple days ago. What's there to do, MIĆO? I came to the village and said: Every homeowner should stop their work, take some bread, and a gun, and get themselves in a troop. And they left, bastards! - They sit in their cozy seats. - Petar! Are you insane? I'm not, MIĆO. There are 20 of them in my troop. They can't wait to attack the Turks. Isn't that so, my eagles? - It is. Indeed. - How could you, Petar? Didn't these people suffer enough Turkish violence? Must we continue the suffering? It's been a long time since you were in Herzegovina, Duke. You forgot, how we fight here. It's not the first, nor last time that we burn villages. It isn't the first time, Captain. But it is the last one! If anyone dares to attack a village, he will pay! I swear to God! He will pay the highest price! You haven't learned a thing, Danilo. Get out of there. - Kosta Simić! - Here! Let's see what you can do. You're better, Simić. I'll give you a good grade. But you must learn more. - Understood? - Yes! Go. - Krivokapić Jolo. - Stop, teach'. - You don't know how to work nor teach. - What do you mean, Chief? This way, one enemy they shoot, and three they miss. - How can I show them better? - You'll see. Kids. Keep your eyes open and take notes! That's easy, Chief, when you come near. That's how I come near to the enemy. Marković. Do you teach these children anything else? No, Duke. Then why did we bring so many books from Dubrovnik? There are no more of those books, Duke. They've been smoked. What? People smoked them. Poor bastards. Those are the Montenegrin messengers. What's the hurry? You'll break your necks! Where is Peko Pavlović? We have an urgent message from the Prince of Cetinje. LJUBIBRATIĆ wants personal authority, brethren. He is preparing for Austro-Hungarian occupation to become Prime Minister. That's impossible. - They can't do that! - Wait! What's to wait? With a traitor, there's no waiting. - Hold your tongue, Captain. - Don't, MIĆO. Do you know what you’re saying? Me, a traitor? You've colluded with Austria for a long time. You traveled from there to Dubrovnik and to here. And from day one you've been asserting yourself. Playing the part of leader of the uprising. And we started it! We did! While you were sitting with crossed arms in Dubrovnik. Don’t speak further, Captain, until we learn more. What's there to learn, Peko? - What? - That's for me to ask. I have a right to that. We carried each other when one would get wounded. Answer clearly! What's the truth here, and what is a lie? What are you talking about? What truth? Give it. I will explain everything right away. Peko! You believe him? - I do, Captain. - Don't believe it, Duke. Don't trust the antichrist! He disturbed the people in their peace. Everything our grandparents did, wasn't good enough for him. To the heroes he forbade to kill their enemies. And in this holy temple, where only priests and heroic outlaws set foot, he brought his concubine! Therefore, I say to all the army: to forbear him, antichrist. And save your soul! Do you hear? Me! Me, the spiritual father of these people! - You're a bastard! - Chief! Which this monastery took in and fed, so your spiteful soul can't be seen by the people. But the soul didn't withhold. Here. It showed its true self. Mr. Reiner! A moment. I hope you won't deny it. The author of this is you! I only have good intentions. I just wanted to help. And I think, despite everything, I succeeded... - I helped you. - Mr. Reiner! I warn you, now is not the time for jokes. The Serbian Prince can't stand you. The Montenegrin Prince even less. In you, they see a rival. Your only chance is to rely... - on the Austro-Hungarian monarchy. - Mr. Reiner. I'm sick of this dirty game. I will choose two companions this instant. They will take you on the shortest path to the Austrian border. But Sir Duke, you're not thinking of the consequences. My government will change their stance. Maybe they will even let the Turks pass through our ports. And note this. If you ever set foot in Herzegovina, only one thing can happen to you. The darkness will eat you up. And my father, in the early uprisings, took up arms. And like every pauper, he fought for freedom and bread. But people, like you, Captain, interested in fame, and those, like this pest, shallow minded, each pulled on their sides. Disagreements led the uprisings to their death. While the people shed their blood. My home was burned by the Turks. And they killed everyone. And in front of me, they put my father on a spear. That's why I became an outlaw, not caring for Princes and Dukes. I robbed, and killed and burned, and took up people's wives. But one word was enough for me to drop that. The word "unity". MIĆO LJUBIBRATIĆ said it. I came here to be united. That's why I'm saying this. I'll kill like dogs all of those who sow discord in Herzegovina. Why are you here? You're afraid, huh? Do you know that Dukes should not be afraid? Not by day, nor by night. Not of a thief, nor a sword. Are you drunk? - What are you doing in my room? - Now you'll see. Take him! No! Get back, if you have any common sense. Ilija! You shout in vain. There's a hole so big in his head, a bird could fly through it. Seize him! - What are you waiting for? - Captain. - Do you know what you're doing, man? - I do. I'm not blind like the others, they don't see the betrayal. That's why I'll seize you and drive you out of Herzegovina! As the Prince said. Repent before you leave, Mihajlo LJUBIBRATIĆ! Your sin is great! Betraying your Fatherland! You betrayed… - Hold him! Quick! Take him! Seize him! Now! Stop! What are you doing, Captain! Take him, quick! Captain! - You're hardheaded. - Don't! Don't shoot! What's the matter with you! You protect him? He laid his hand on me! I'll deal with him! Leave us. You want to shoot instead of him? Huh? Shoot. Shoot! I don't need a life given by you. I don't need your death. You're no Duke! And you'll never be one. I jumped at your throat. You should kill me! - Captain! - Wait, stop. That's not all. You're not only not a real Duke, but once again you showed that you only think of your fame. You didn't let them kill me. You want them to praise you for forgiving. - So everyone would talk of your mercy. - Captain. I thought we would reason as men. But you cannot see the truth because you are blinded by envy and hatred. Reasoning with you is in vain. Out! Go! Just until here. Here's our school. MIĆO. The whole trip I was thinking... Come with me to Dubrovnik. You'll be gone for 4 or 5 days. Spirits will calm down. I fear for you. I have to be here right now. That's more dangerous than the Turks. The troops are full of poison. The Captain and that madman Kumantij speak the worst of you. That you're aiming for a Prince position of sorts in Herzegovina. You, a Prince? Sadly, there's more and more of such stories. How will this all end? Who knows…? It's the hardest for a man to prove he's not just after power. But we'll see. Have a safe trip. - And beware of the Turks. - I'll hurry. The cannons already await. I just have to give the money. Jenny, listen to me again. If the price is too high, give up. - We can't expect you to give all your… - That's my business. - Goodbye! - Goodbye! Go, Nikola! - Let's stop. - Very well, Duke. Stop, people. Wait. Stop, people. Lay down the wounded. Stop! Stop! Stop! Stay! Stop! MIĆO, the Turks are coming, burning and killing everything in their path. What Turks? From where? I heard they came straight from Istanbul. More than 20 thousand of them. Duke! Just stand on the top of the hill. One of their troops is at our feet. Jenny, are you well informed? - They come from Istanbul? - Yes. Austria let them pass through their ports. Reiner told me in Dubrovnik that you refused their offer. And that you could've expected this. Where are the cannons? Here, in the carriage. Milica! - Where are you going in this weather? - I'm going to Montenegro, ma'am. I'm taking the wounded into safety. Ilija! Nikola! Take the fastest horse to Duke Peko. Tell him the Turks are coming. Very well, Duke. Ilija! Take the people to the mountain and don't let the Turks follow you. Vladimir Petrovich! Take the cannons and when you come to the monastery, place them. Sir Duke, if you allow, I'll stay here. To keep the Turks at bay. I'll take the cannons later. I don't need much time. Very well, comrade. Go! People! People, that's your cross and your bones. Everyone with a gun, go! - The enemy is looking in our yard. - Let's go. Forward! Let's go, brethren. Forward! Come on! - Take the cannons to the monastery. - As you wish, Duke! Let's go, people. Go! Come on, come on! Faster! Come on, people! I haven't seen as many since we started the fight in Herzegovina! Peko! Peko! Oh, MIĆO! A miracle from the Turks! If I were drunk, I'd say I see 5 times more than there are. But I'm sober, God dammit. On the road we fought their advance troop. The Russian is setting up the cannons. Kuznetsov. Well yes, we'll need them soon. Look, man. They're carrying gear and guns as if they were attacking Russia. Were there any consultations about the order of troops? We've decided. Let the troops lay low. And in the morning, when the Turks go forth, we will strike, and let the Lord be on our side! Good God! The Prince's messengers. - On what business do you come here? - Duke! News from the Prince. Peko! What will you do? What will I do? What are these secrets? Let everyone know! Musić! Read it to everyone. "Duke Peko Pavlović, Since the Herzegovinian Dukes did not obey my orders to remove MIĆO LJUBIBRATIĆ, I am discontinuing their help. I order a swift return of our troops to Montenegro. Prince Nikola the First." Peko! Leave me alone, man. MIĆO LJUBIBRATIĆ, if you're an honorable man and Herzegovinian, you'll leave this instant, anywhere across the border, just to not be here. We need the Montenegrin troops more than air. I'll go when it's needed. When we all decide that, not just you, Captain. Peko! You were given an order. What will you do? Look down and I won't have to say it. Am I to leave you now? When the enemies are pouring in… MIĆO! The gear Garibaldi sent, still didn't come. I know, I know. And it won't come. - How so? - Austria closed the border. Go, Karlo. Duke. Duke, I came to talk to you once again. - But I must. - I'm listening, Kostić. I hear that the Montenegrin Prince ordered his armies to withdraw. The Serbian Prince sent that same order three days ago. What? I didn't want to bother you, we decided right away to stay. But since it started to unfold, it's better you know. How did he order you that? His Highness sent a messenger. He doesn't want to assist in the personal plans of Duke LJUBIBRATIĆ. Oral order. If we don't leave Herzegovina right away... military court. - Thank you, Kostić. - You're welcome. Just doing my duty. Jenny. Tomorrow morning it will be awful. Not even men will withstand. You can still get back. I'd rather you told me what happened today. - Go back. - That's out of the question. What happened? A lot of things. - I should leave Herzegovina. - Leave the uprising? Yes. You're dispirited. How can you leave? Only a weak man can do that. Michel. Or maybe, it is heroism. Now I'm not sure about anything. Maybe that's the only way to avoid further problems. But I still can't. I still have things to do. But Michel, you lived for the uprising. Tomorrow is the fight with the Turks. The decisive battle. If we win it, we will organize a parliament of the whole Herzegovina. Its government in front of the people and the world. Only then I can leave. They will be here in two hours. Everybody in their positions? Not everyone, MIĆO. At any moment… The Captain? - Where is Lieutenant Kostić? - In his troop, of course. Lieutenant Kostić! Hey, they're calling you. I heard. Kostić, here! It's easy to be a Serb. But still hard. Lieutenant. We will let the Turks pass. You intercept them. Yes, sir, Duke. Vuko! Announce to the soldiers: Not one should fail. Whoever came to fight for freedom, should fight like 5 men. Yes, sir, Duke! Let's go. Play your music. Play, you bastards. As if you know it's your last. What did you see, eagle Prdekrio? Something good? Nothing good. And don’t expect good news. The Captain and the Priest sent two troops home. Now is not the time for the drink. God damn it! Where did you see them? Under the cave, Chief. I immediately came to tell you. It's the advance troop. Take your positions. Good luck! Attention please. Listen. When the Duke attacks the main troop, we'll deal with the rest. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen. You left the battlefield, but a gun you barely held, you bastards. It's a real shame that we're leaving, Chief. But we were told not to fight for MIĆO LJUBIBRATIĆ. They said he's serving the Empire. Ah! That's what the Captain said, and this monastical dung beetle. Them, Chief. You forgot my word. - Scabby troublemaker! - Don't protect the antichrist! Repent! Fire! Fire! Aim! Fire! Forward! Attack! Forward! - Serbs attack, let's revenge Kosovo. - Wait! - Stop! - What is it? But, Lieutenant. Kosovo? Where is that coming from, we've already avenged it. Run, Vuko! Vladimir, fire! Vladimir, aim better, God damn it! - I want to waste Turkish gunpowder. - Very well, Duke! Hurry, you bastard. It's ready, Duke. Fire! Remember, the Prince told us to get back. Why didn't you say that right away, God damn it? - Good thing you mentioned His Highness… - Come on! Try again and good luck. - Let's go! - Let's go, God help us. Serbs! Forward! For spite! And now, outlaws! Forward! Vladimir, bless you! And now, my Montenegrins... Forward! Forward! Get away from me! Fire! Forward! Attack! Forward! - Don't give up, brethren! - Go! - Stand up! - Don't let the Turks win! - Protect us! - Forward! Don't give up, brethren! Don't let the Turks… Hide! Run! Follow me! Stop! Get back! LJUBIBRATIĆ! Get back! Stop! Get back! The Turks are running away. Hey, do you hear? We're winning. We won! MIĆO! Stop, Captain! You spat on the union. And laid your hand on your brethren. - Chief! – I'll kill you. I don't care. May our descendants be ashamed of you. Brethren! We spoke of laws and manifests. All that is left is for this meeting to be named the Herzegovinian Parliament. Priest Bogdan is the eldest among us. Let him say a couple of words. What is there to say? We've been talking for three days. Brethren, if you are for the Parliament, rise. It's time to make our oaths. Take off your hats. We swear on the land that gave birth to us, and which will take us on after we die. We swear on our misery, seen by the Gods eyes, that the laws which we spoke of here will be upheld. And that we acknowledge this Parliament as the single government of Herzegovina. We swear! Help, brethren! The Turks are coming! No! Take that one, Janko! Don't let them raise their arms! Janko! What? Father Bogdan. I would like to say a few words, if I may. Please, Duke Vačević. Brethren! We still must choose a Prime Minister. I know there will be protests from Vienna, and Belgrade, and Cetinje. And maybe even among us. But I believe the Prime Minister should be the one who did the most for what we have today. MIĆO LJUBIBRATIĆ. Oh yes, he spoke well. What do you think, Peko? - I agree. - I'm for it too. We do have to choose a Prime Minister. But not me. - I'm leaving Herzegovina. - You can't! What are you saying, MIĆO? You can't go, MIĆO. Not now. We fought the Turks. We killed the spawns, agreed on everything. - You can't leave. - Brethren. Don't talk me out of it. You all know that, if I stay, there will again be problems. How will I stop the evil tongues? How will I stop the seed of doubt? How will I prove to Belgrade and Cetinje that I'm not interested in personal authority? I can only prove that... if I leave. Now, when we accomplished all this, when we can be united before the world, now I can leave. There is some truth to what you are saying, MIĆO. It wouldn't be wise to close our eyes in front of the truth. That's why we must make a good choice. Because we all feel the greatness of that sacrifice. The sacrifice that one can only make for their Homeland and freedom. Is it done? Yes. When are you leaving? In the morning. I'm taking the wounded to Montenegro. Let me know there where you are. My brethren! Circumstances much stronger than my will are making me leave this place. I will be gone until the circumstances are different. And to you, my dear brethren, I can only show one path you must follow. Because only that path leads to freedom. There is no room for personal desires, but there should be room for harmony and unity in your hearts. Heroically fight under the leadership of the new Duke, to whom I sincerely wish better luck than I had with obstacles. To our brave friends, who came from afar, to share the good and the bad, I ask just one thing. Don't give up on the altruistic causes which brought you here. And now, let's say our goodbyes. Goodbye, brethren. Goodbye! Goodbye! Come back to us, Duke! Goodbye, Duke! Duke! Come back to us! Goodbye, Duke! Have a safe trip! Duke! Get back to us! Goodbye, Duke! Get back to us!
