A pistol packin' mama, lady baby. I'm sure as hell happy that you're on my side. [Sheba] I don't know, Melba. I see ya' shootin' off a gun every time you turn around anymore. Bad enough pluggin" that girl at the bank. Lucky it was her leg and not her head. You can be a shoe in for eternal damnation by now. I can't help it. So, I'm crazy about both of you. (sighs) I dug you first, didn't I, Shawn? You dug me first? Yeah. I want, I just wanna know how you feel about Snake. Aw, Shawn, come on. Now my daughter, Jim boy, could have been married about six times before this. The men became big executives. Yeah, you should have seen her as a little girl. Always so in love with nature and life in general. Once Daniel got shot, we traveled west. She just worked at everything she could find to help pay the rent. Beg, borrowed, but never stole. She never stole to get the down payment on that. God damn beauty parlor. You love me, don't you, Shawn? I mean you wouldn't leave me, would ya'? No. God. Cheryl, you don't even know what's going on. Why don't you kiss me. Well, let's do something that'll make us both feel real good. [Sheba] She almost died giving birth to Cheryl. Told the doctor, if it comes down to me or the baby, you save that child.
