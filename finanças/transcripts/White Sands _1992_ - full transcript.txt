Hey, Ray. Jeez, did your wife get you that hat? - Something wrong with it? - Nothing that pissing on it won't cure. Maybe we all ought to just form a circle right here now and do it. - Hi. - Hi. We were flying over the gorge, and Cas spotted him down here. I got 20/15 vision. Pilot called in on his radio and told the authority. He's an Indian. I'm Harold Kleinman. What were you doing way out here, Harold? Oh, me and the Cas, we're amateur archeologists. We left the wives back in Santa Fe this morning and headed out in this direction, hoping to find this ancient "Anastazi" battlefield... Anasazi. I guess you don't find many bodies out here, huh? No, we sure don't. - What do you think, Bert? - He's dead. Why would anyone come all the way out here to kill himself? Well, maybe his wife bought him a new hat and made him wear it. Of course, I won't be positive till I do an autopsy. Hi. How you doing? You bring these tourists out here? Just trying to keep them from finding any arrowheads. - Ray Dolezal. - Delmar Blackwater. - Hey. Don't touch the car. - Okay. Sorry. - Navajo? Oh. - Mescalero Apache. Blood-thirstiest, red-bastard savages this side of the rio Brazos. I was kind of hoping for that scalp. Yeah, we ought to get this bad boy out of here, Ray. He's starting to smell ripe. Yeah. Hey, uh, if you need any more pens like that, you just let me know, Sheriff. I sell a whole line of novelty pens just like that, imprinted with the message of your choice. Holy shit! Ray, you're not actually gonna tag that and report it as evidence, are you? Ray? - What stopped that bike, Ben? - I don't know. Gravity? Is that real money? - Uh, yeah. - Gee, that's a lot. There's got to be a thousand dollars there, Dad. What you looking at? Look, Ace, why don't you go home and tell Mom I'll be home real soon? - I got some more work to do. - Okay. See you later, Dad. Okay. This is Deputy Sheriff Ray Dolezal, Torrance County 4-3-niner-2-7-7. I'd like a trace and status on a '90 T-Bird, VIN number, 2-6-Charles-Henry-Charles 3-niner-Nora-1-John- 1-2-1-2-2-niner-2. I can be reached at 412-5607. I'd appreciate it if you could expedite this. Thanks. Maybe the federales will be able to make an ID and get him out of here by the end of the week. Maybe I won't even have to cut him open. That briefcase could be $20,000 lighter, Ray. Nobody'd know we didn't find it that way. Think it was a self-inflicted wound? There's no reward for being so damn black-and-white ethical, Raymond. Was it a self-inflicted wound, Bert? Rug fuzz. Here. Take a look. - Ugly rug. - Butt-ugly rug. Longhorn Ranch Motel. Paid cash up front for the first night. Had this big old wad of bills. God damn it. I think that's what must have fooled me is that big wad of cash he had. I figured he could stand good for the balance. That's a $63 mistake, isn't it? How'd you know it was my rug, anyway? Did you see him leave? Didn't see him at all after he checked in. I'm not the nosy type, you understand. Did this Mr. Spencer make any calls? Well, if he did, he, uh... He didn't make them from the room here. We got this special deal. For four dollars, you can make unlimited local calls, - but, uh, he passed on it. - Did he have a car? He said he did. I never seen it. You know, we, uh... We usually clean these rooms up almost every day, but, uh, Mr. Spencer, he put that "Do Not Disturb" sign there on the door. You probably saw it when we come in. If a customer wants privacy, we're gonna give it to him. Decorate these rooms yourself, Mr. Peterson? No. No, I brought me this fairy over from Albuquerque. He did it. I couldn't do this. I'm... I'm color-blind. Looks like there's been a fire in there. What? - Don't touch anything. - No, sir. Jesus Christ, what the hell's he been doing in here? My Lord. This look like teeth marks to you? Well, maybe. - Teeth marks? Huh. - Yeah, I think so. You got a hell of an imagination, Raymond. Let's go. Got this John Doe up your butt now, don't you? Gonna drive us all crazy trying to figure it out. Ruin my Saturday afternoon in front of the TV. Guy's in trouble, holed up in a motel room with half a million bucks, scared, writing on everything, making desperation calls. Now he has to cover his trail. He burns his clothes. He swallows that piece of paper. Let's say that, that happens in the morning, and he's dead by noon. Maybe that piece of paper wasn't digested. Intestinal gases. Oh, the ever-loving death fart of a warthog. All we got are two names. "Goodman" and a date written on one of those fast food wrappers, kind of looks like an appointment. "Noreen." Who the hell is Noreen? Oh, ease off. You're as persistent as a dog with two dicks. Ugh. Yeah, you're gonna owe me for this one. Promise you that. Ah-ha! Looks like a radish. They in season? Oh, cut it out, Bert. And here's a carrot. Garbanzo bean. This may be putrefied lettuce. Must've been a salad bar or one of those deals. There's a sorrowful last act for a desperate man. Hey, maybe Noreen was with him. Maybe she had a big burger with fries. Maybe Mr. Goodman was there and he had apple pie. Yeah, yeah, it's all starting to make sense now. We'll call it "The Big Lunch." Wait, what... God damn. This looks like paper. It's that kind of waxy paper they wrap hamburgers in. It's got about a 200-year half-life. Something's definitely written on this one. - What's it say? - Uh, it's smeared. Numbers? - Numbers. - Son of a bitch. Now, just 'cause there's seven digits does not necessarily mean it's a telephone number. We're sorry. The number you have reached is not in service. Maybe it's in Utah. Motel didn't have a record of long-distance. Probably used a credit card or billed to another number. We're sorry... - What's the area code in Texas? - They got about five. You are one tenacious SOB. You gonna call all 50 states on my phone? Maybe that's not a six, maybe it's a zero. Holy unrelenting bastard. - Hello. - Hi. Who's this? This is 803-1424. - And who's this? - Mr. Spencer. - Ooh, just a minute. - Who is it? - Ray, who is it? - Spencer? - That's right. Who's this? - Goodman, Spencer. Where the hell have you been? - You were supposed to call. - Oh, Goodman. Uh, I, uh, ran into a problem, but everything's taken care of now. You're four days late. Yeah, I know, but everything's fine now. I... It was a personal thing. Yeah? Well, we figured you changed your mind. - Why would I change my mind? - Don't get cute, Spencer. You're four days late. We're ready to cut you loose and forget about the whole thing. No! Look, I'm sorry about the delay. There's a hotel in Taos called the Kachina Lodge. Be there tomorrow at 8:00 p.m. A room will be reserved in your name. Kachina Lodge. 8:00 p.m. Fine. Bring the money. Of course. Well? Dad, stop! Stop! Look out for my bike! - Did you bring your gun? - Yep. See you probably tomorrow. - Bye. - Bye, honey. - Be careful. - I will. Bye! Bye, Ray! I don't think he's a base-stealing threat. I think he's capable of stealing a base... Come on. Throw it over. - Yeah? - Good afternoon, sir. We're trying to locate, uh, the Deputy Sheriff, Ray, uh... - Dolezal. - Ray Dolezal. Would you know where he is? Something wrong? Don't guess you find many bodies out here, huh? Why would anyone come all the way out here to kill himself? Think it was a self-inflicted wound? Did Mr. Spencer make any calls? Noreen. Who the hell is she? Spencer, where the hell have you been? You were supposed to call. You're four days late. Oh! - Is this your room? - Uh, yeah. - Oh, I was just finishing it up. - Oh, okay. Mr. Spencer? - Yes? - Sorry to bother you. On the bed! Don't move. I said don't move! Welcome to Taos. - It better not be marked. - Or what? Hey! Hey, wait a second! What's going on? - Hey! What the fuck are you doing? - Stay still. God damn it! Down, boy! Are my hands cold? You know, we could've come in here and taken this money and cut you up for coyote food. Lucky for you we're not criminals. Lennox wants you in Santa Fe the day after tomorrow. He'll be at the Hotel La Fonda bar, 6:00 p.m. Don't be early. Don't be late. You might wanna bring a change of clothes. - Hello. - Hi, honey. - Ray, where are you? - I'm still in Taos. - I'm gonna stay the night here. - Is everything okay? Everything's fine. Just fine. Look, I don't think I'm gonna make it home tomorrow. Maybe Tuesday. I'll come home as soon as I can. Get on top of him! Get his leg! Get his arms! Ray? Hi. Greg Meeker. Welcome to the all-new Albuquerque offices of the FBI. Have a seat. Do you like snapshots, Ray? I love snapshots. Little frozen fragments of time. Completely real. But unless you know what happened right before or right after a picture was taken, well, hell, you don't know much of shit, do you? Where's my hat? Artie O'Brien, AKA Spencer. - He's dead. - See? No way you'd know that from looking at this photo. No. That's Goodman. That's the redhead. Gorman Lennox. Ever met him? - No. - Me, neither. Kind of like this one, though. You gave him my money, Ray. FBI funds. You give a half million bucks to a man you don't even know? What the fuck did you think you were you doing? Look, I should've let you guys handle it, but I was just trying to ID a body. - With Bureau money, huh? - With whatever I had! All right. Cool. I can accept that. From cop to cop. Square business. Cop to cop. Straight up? Tell me about him. This Artie O'Brien/Spencer guy. Artie was a mule. From time to time, he would transport money from here to there for us and shit like that. Something went wrong on this one. We don't know why. - But then you stepped in... - And fucked up, Ray. Look, I didn't pull the trigger that blew your delivery boy's brains out. No, you didn't. Look, let's just figure out how you're gonna pay back the money and get you back home. - What are you talk... - See, Ray, in your government's eyes, you were responsible for the money since it was your call to, you know, pretty much go ahead and give it away. Maybe talk to your sheriff. Pull it out of petty cash. What if I went to Santa Fe? Kept the meeting with Lennox, told him the deal was off? I'd get you back your money. Oh, man, you're an amateur. You don't know what the fuck is out there. - You want your money or not? - You're still trying to figure out who killed Artie, aren't you? Forget Artie. Artie killed himself. Hang on a minute. He might be right, Greg. It may be our only play. Think about it. The bimbos have already seen him. They think he's Spencer. What have we got to lose? - Okay? - Okay. Go to Santa Fe. I gotta use your phone. I wanna call my wife, tell her I'm okay. She worries, you know. - You can't call your wife, Ray. - Why not? Nobody can know what you're doing until it's done. You're undercover. It's called standard operating procedure. If you're gonna do this, you're gonna do it our way. - Spencer have a first name? - Bob. Artie called himself Bob, Bob Spencer. - Bob? - Yes. I can be a Bob. Gracias. So what'd they say? No, come on, tell me what they said. They said they were very pretty pictures, but they only show the work of professional artists. - Ah. - Mr. Lennox? Gorman Lennox? Hi, I'm Bob. Bob Spencer. Oh, Jesus. Bob, hey. Where'd you get that hat? Oh. It's new. No kidding. Oh, would you excuse us? - Uh, Mr... - Hold on a second, Bob. - Uh, Bob, this is, um... - Roz. - Roz Kincaid. - Hi. Nice to meet you, Roz. Well, Roz, Bob here is from, uh, Los Angeles. He has a very important collection of American Western art. Isn't that right, Bobby? Uh. Uh-huh. I sort of tricked you, Roz. I'm an art broker. And Bob here is a client. I'm gonna take him around to some of the galleries, recommend some acquisitions. But first, I'd like him to look at your paintings. I'm gonna recommend that he buys one. - That is if we can come to a fair price. - No, no. I... You're an artist? Just look at the work, Bob. You tell me. - Are they for sale? - This is silly. Hell, yes! What are you doing? Jesus Christ, Bob. What are you doing? What if she comes out here and sees that? Those are her dreams. You don't throw away somebody's dreams. Come on. Let's go. We're on a schedule. We gotta move. Ben, I told you to stay out of the street. - Now come inside. - Okay. Pick up your bike and then come inside and sit down. - Hi. - Hi. - Molly Dolezal? - That's me. Mrs. Dolezal, I'm Special Agent Flynn. This is Special Agent Demott. We're with FBI Internal Affairs. We, uh... We wanna talk to your husband. We saw the note on the office. One of your neighbors told us that you work here. - He's not back... - Do you have a gun? Ben, I'm gonna talk with these gentlemen - for a couple of minutes. - Okay. Why don't you go on home and set the table for dinner? Sorry to interrupt you here at work. - We deal with crimes within the FBI. - So, how can I help you? Mrs. Dolezal, we're investigating the disappearance of some half a million dollars from one of our impound facilities. Money being held as evidence in a court case. We have reason to believe your husband may be involved. - You're from the FBI? - Yes. We know that our prime suspect in this theft was working with an accomplice. We know your husband found our prime suspect dead out in the desert along with our money. And, now your husband's disappeared, and we can't locate the accomplice. My husband's simply trying to find out who the dead man was. - If he calls... - I'll tell him you want to talk to him. That is all you want, to talk to him? Mrs. Dolezal, here's my card. I realize you want to protect your husband, but please just think about one thing. Half a million dollars. It's a lot of temptation. They use the same clay for their fish that the Indians used to make their pots a thousand years ago. You're worried about your money, right? Yeah, well, actually, that's what I wanted to talk to you about. Well, don't worry about it. It's in a safety deposit box along there with mine. Well, I was thinking, I don't know. Maybe we should reconsider. Hey, listen, I'm sorry that the girls got a little rough, but it's microelectronics, Bobby. We're living in the age of the body wire and all that. So, it's a little understandable that we got a little paranoid. Of course, my personal feelings on the subject is that it's all about trust. I mean, you trusted me with your half-million dollars. So, naturally, I'm inclined to trust you. I mean, Lane said that you'd deliver, and you did. Most guys wouldn't trust me. So, it was a test? What did Lane tell you about me? Nothing. What did Lane tell you about me? Nothing. You see? It's trust. It's all we got. It's all we need. I gotta tell you something, Bobby. You're not at all what I expected. How's that? Well, the way Lane was talking, I expected something packaged a little fancier, sort of a fast-talking, slow-walking Mohair Sam kind of a thing. You know, you show up in your cowboy hat and I thought, "God damn, I hooked up with Andy of Mayberry." Look, Gorman, if you don't feel comfortable with me, maybe you're right. Maybe we should call the deal off. - You give me my money back. - Am I edgy? Do I seem edgy? You know, I quit smoking about a week ago, and, uh... It's been like boring a wild hair up my ass. I mean, I can't do anything right. It's just, uh... Look, let me just chill out. We'll relax. You put up $500,000. I put up $500,000. We're partners. We're all locked in. Right. Uh, we expecting someone? Well, yeah. Lane. - Lane? - Yeah, she was a little concerned when you didn't show up, when she didn't hear from you. Thought maybe you backed out. Ah, here she is. Here comes Lane. Here's our girl. - Hiya, honey. - Hi. - Hope I didn't hold you up. - No, not at all. Just wanted to see Bobby here squirm when you showed up. Well, where did you disappear to last week? Well, you know. You could have called. Yeah. Well, let's sit down. You know, when Gorman told me he was finally meeting with you face to face, I decided I had to see it with my own eyes. You see, I thought perhaps something had gone wrong. - Obviously not. - No. Just personal business. Gorman, you officially owe me a finder's fee. Well, I'll take care of your end as soon as the deal goes through. I've got to confirm my transportation. Don't let her bulldoze you, Bobby. She's used to getting pretty much everything she wants. So... Bob. Who are you really? Bob Spencer. Really. - The other one was lying? - Must've been. So, where is the other Bob Spencer now? He's dead. He's dead? Yeah, look. You could blow me out of the water right here. You know it and I know it. But since you didn't do it right off, I'm betting you're waiting for the deal to go through so you can get your fee from Lennox. Am I right? Hello. Did you kill him? Would it matter to you if I did? - Did you kill him? - No. We're all set. Can you give us a ride? - Yeah, I'd love to. No, I'll do it. - I can drive. Bobby, why drive when one can be driven? You know, that's one of my rules. Hey, Bobby, you like helicopters? Helicopters? Come on. Get in the front. This is Bob Spencer. You might wanna buckle up there, Bob. Mr. Lennox. Lieutenant Colonel Bedrosian, Gorman Lennox. This is my partner Bob Spencer. - How you doing, Bob? - Hi, how you doing? - Let's get inside. - Hi. - It's a little noisy here. - Come on. Ever hear of the White Sands before, Bob? Uh, no, I sure haven't. You know, it's not sand. It's gypsum. Some kind of prehistoric underground lake. A little keepsake I made myself. Just don't tell anybody where you got it, huh? Taking sand is illegal. Hang your keys on. Something to remember White Sands by. I'd like to take a quick reconnaissance of that briefcase. Money talks, bullshit walks. Be my guest. Gentlemen, let's do some business. These are M-16s. Brand spanking new. Sidearms. 9mm Berettas. Hollow-point ammunition. C-4 explosives. Claymore mines. Flechette grenades. Now this, gentlemen, is the AT-4 Viper. This little lady will knock out a tank at 300 yards. Armor penetration, 11.81 inches plus. Muzzle velocity, 985 feet per second. Now, your ground troops like it because it's light, reliable, easy to operate. International Arms magazine rated this little honey four stars. It'll fill your basic needs. I'm impressed. This all army surplus, stuff that wasn't used up during Desert Storm? Negatory. This is state of the art, Bob. We're dealing direct with Defense Department procurement. We'll give you gentlemen 500 now and 500 on delivery. Well, no. Actually, there's been a slight increase in cost. Excuse me? We'll require 400,000 more on the back end. Hey, man, that's bullshit. If you can't handle the volume, there's no harm, no foul. Eh, fuck it then. Forget it. No sale. I ought to turn you two pricks over to the Treasury Department, collect a little reward. We'll just take our money back, boys. I'm afraid we can't do that. We've already incurred significant costs. We consider it a non-refundable deposit. Half... Half a million dollars, a non-refundable deposit? You two cheap, dime-store cowboys squatting on your fat-ass pensions over in Las Cruces. Black-marketing military hardware to the highest bidders. You fuckers make me want to puke. This is a wash. We're out of here. - Fuck them. - Wait a second. Wait a second. This is crazy! You guys changed the rules. How do you expect us to react? We're not talking about pocket change. We're talking about $400,000 we gotta come up with somewhere. It was unavoidable and unforeseen. Fine, fine, but you're expecting us to take it on faith that you've had an increase on your end, but you're not giving us credit for believing you. You're just passing the whole cost onto us. All right. I tell you what. - We'll eat $150,000. - Okay. That means you owe us $750,000 on delivery. Well, that was nicely done, Bobby, but maybe now you can explain to me, uh, how we're gonna come up with that extra $250,000. I thought you had financing wired. You do this all the time. I'm not the money man. You're the money man, partner. If I had the money, I wouldn't need you, now would I? Mr. Spencer's not in his room right now. Would you like to leave a message? Are you sure you're ringing the right room? It's Bob Spencer. Yes, ma'am. I'm sure. Well, could you just give me his room number? I'm sorry, we can't give out guest room numbers. - Would you like to leave a message? - No. - Good night. - Good night. What I need is for you to just let me wait in his room until... - That's just not possible. - Well, I'm not just anybody. We have a relationship, Bob Spencer and I, a close relationship, and this is a very unpleasant situation. I'm sorry, ma'am, but I just can't help... Good night. Any messages for Lennox in 306? No, sir, Mr. Lennox. Mr. Spencer, sorry to bother you. There's this woman who's been asking to be let into your room. Whoa. Hey, I hope we're practicing safe sex these days, Bob. - I'll see you in the morning. - Okay. She wouldn't leave a note. Said her name was Noreen and that you'd want her to be let in. - What did she look like? - She was just here. You must have walked right past her when you came in. Sort of offbeat, redhead, um, around 25. - Oh. Okay. Thanks. - Sure. You're not very good at this. Hey, we're just watching your ass. I'm FBI. I work for Meeker. You didn't warn me about Lane Bodine. You didn't know squat about Noreen! Could be she's got you confused with some other Bob Spencer. Hey, you wanted to see where Artie's ride took you. Well, here's where it goes, cowboy. And we're only halfway home. That Lane's a piece of work, huh? What do you mean we're only halfway home? You're running some kind of undercover sting on Lennox and you're using me for bait. Hey, I didn't send you in blind, Ray. I just didn't tell you everything. But if you want to bail, I'll understand. I won't hold it against you. I'll just write up a report indicating you lost the money, couldn't get it back. No, no, I'm in. I'm in. Let's get this guy. Just don't bullshit me anymore. All right. The truth is, I've been chasing Gorman Lennox for five fucking years, trying to bust him on an arms rap. Took me 18 months to get Artie in place, then the whole thing just blew up in my face. Artie was FBI? One of my best undercovers. Do you think Lane killed him? Artie's a suicide. Stay on track here, Ray. - I need another $250,000. - What? The supplier upped the ante, and I told Lennox I'd take care of it. Wait, wait, wait. You expect me to give you another 250 grand on top of the 500 you already lost? Yeah, it's your operation, isn't it? I'm already way out on a limb for you. Get serious. If I don't come up with that money, Lennox isn't gonna believe I am who I say I am. And if I tried to run that up the Bureau flagpole, nobody'd salute. Oh, fine, but where the hell am I supposed to get the money then? Ms. Bodine's got a talent for finding cash for lost causes. She's damn good at it, too. Takes a nice commission. She's already getting a finder's fee for setting me up with Lennox. A finder's fee is what, maybe five grand? This is a whole different ball game. The commission on this whole arms deal's got to be over 100 large. I'm sure she'd go for it. Besides, she likes living on the edge, playing in the gutter, seducing men of mystery like Artie. Like you. I'm not saying you have to. I'm just saying it's an option. You can sell it to her somehow. - How much are we talking about? - $250,000. Bob and I are already at risk for an even million. We were set to do it ourselves, but our supplier jacked the price up. So, here you are. Well, we need another $250,000 and Bob thought, uh... - Bob thought? - Thank you. Well, Bob thought that you might be willing to cross the line in this one case for the greater good. I don't ever get involved in these kinds of deals. No, but you will connect us with someone that does and take a fee, right? I don't think you're in any position to comment on my ethics, Bob. Well, excuse me, the truth is the people you're trying to help are being butchered by the government peace-keeping patrols and blankets and Rice-A-Roni ain't gonna change that. Since when do you care what happens to innocent people anywhere? All I'm saying is before humanitarian aid can work, there's got to be some humanity to give it to. He almost sounds like he believes it, doesn't he? Who are you buying these weapons from? Well, if I told you that, now, you could go straight to the source and, uh, cut me and old Bob out here completely. I mean, that is if you were the kind of person to get involved in this sort of thing. Now what I wanna do is, we'll give you 10% of the total deal. That's $125,000. That's your share. And we'll work out whatever guarantees you might need to protect yourself, uh, and your friends from slippery old Gorman Lennox. "My friends." Yes, so you're talking about 10% - of the front end? - Right. So, you buy these guns from your suppliers for what... Well, what, if I'm 10%... $1.25 million. Then you turn around, sell 'em to your freedom fighters for $3 million. I think I'd like 10 percent of the back end. Three hundred thousand. Don't you think that's fair, Bob? I don't think you really care whether it's fair or not, but it's nice of you to ask. Very genuine. Well, I like to be completely upfront with my business associates. What about you? Me? I believe in money, Miss Bodine. And if you got it or you can get it, we're gonna be the best friends you ever had. Well? Foreplay's over, Lane. It's time to fuck. I suppose I could do one of my little events. But one of you is gonna have to stay here and help me make the sales pitch to my friends. Well, Lane, I'd love to stay here tonight but, uh, unfortunately, I have to go to El Paso to arrange some cargo transportation. I'm sure Bob can, uh, stay here and take care of things. Bob? - Hey, Bob. The keys. - Oh, yeah. - No, no, no, thank you. - Thanks. So, who did kill Bob Spencer? How do you know someone killed him? I only said he was dead. Well, how did he die then? Suicide. Look, you don't have to be straight with me. It's okay. But it doesn't lend itself to intimacy. We're already intimate, aren't we? I mean, the minute you decided to be Spencer, and I decided to go along with it, we became intimate. All right, look. Maybe this is all a bit of a game to you, but, you see, if Gorman ever finds out that you're not Spencer... Well, let's just say it would be helpful to me if I knew who I was dealing with. Okay, I'm a guy that Bob Spencer could be, that could be Bob Spencer. Works for you, works for Lennox. Works for me. You're making fun of me now. No. In another context... I could be stable. I could be married, raise a kid. Same guy, different story. Which is the guy I'm attracted to? I don't know. Either way, I should just trust you? Yeah. I'm just trying to be honest here. I figure one of us should try it. Okay, we're being honest here? Tell me... Is there something between you and Lennox? It's ancient history and it's not important. Trust me. Coffee? Yeah. Thanks. Great. Lane, I need, uh... Look, I need... Our relationship, I need to keep it on a business level. For right now, or forever? You don't want to get involved with me, Lane. We'll raise the money, we'll do the deal, and then I disappear. I've never met anyone like you. You're honest... Even when you're lying. Hi. This is Bob. Hi. Bob. Nice to meet you. Hi, how are you, ma'am? Miss Bodine, we have a call for you in the house. - Tell them to call back. - Okay. - Hi. - Hi, there. How are you? - Great to see you. Super party. - Thanks. Wonderful. I'm having a great time. Oh, hi. - Take it to the table in front. - Yes, ma'am. - Shall we go? - Oh, sure. - Hello. - Nice to see you. - How are you? - Good. Very good. Uh, there's something I want to show you here. It's a letter. Here. This might give you some idea of what we're up against. Uh, here's a pen. You like horses? Not especially. This looks like a good one. Well, you're right. He is. We're riding the rodeo on Friday, aren't we? - Really? - Yeah. You're not the kind of woman I'd expect to see in a rodeo. I'm not the kind of woman you'd expect. Hold that? Nice. Antique? Uh, I don't know. Gorman gave it to me a couple of years ago. Could be valuable. Could be fake. So, how come you knew Spencer and Lennox didn't? Spencer found me. Spencer was a sleazy grifter who said he had a lot of money and was looking for a way to get it into play. And I set up a meeting with Gorman just to get him off my back. Spencer deserved Gorman Lennox. They deserved each other. You forgot to mention you get a finder's fee. Come on, Bob. Look around you. Does it really seem like a finder's fee is gonna make or break me? No, but 300 grand from that arms deal sure could buy you a lot of hay and Persian rugs. I think Lennox and you play this game every once in a while. You pull in someone like Spencer... Maybe you're scamming him, maybe you aren't. Maybe you and Gorman are scamming me. You make a big pile of money, and then you come back here to the ranch and pretend you're only interested in worthy causes. I give all the money I earn on these deals to people who need it. Three hundred thousand can do a lot of good in the right hands. Noble. Hey, I don't have to justify myself to you. No, you don't, but it's a fine line, isn't it? Separating you and Lennox? Sometimes that's all you've got. All right, you want to know about Gorman and me? This is the picture. I was 20 years old. I still believed in good and evil and Gorman was the sexiest man I'd ever laid eyes on. He was smart, he was dangerous. And that was an incredible turn-on. And I didn't know any better. I had a trust fund and I was bored. And then one night he came home, put a gun to my head and pulled the trigger... Just to see the look on my face when I heard the click and realized it was empty. So what's this guy still doing in your life? Gorman's like a virus. Once you got him, he won't go away. And now you got him. But you're not bored anymore, are you? You're chasing your own tail here. It's an open-and-shut case. Artie stole the money from the FBI impound, and Artie's dead. So, what do you think happened? Artie was a burnout. I should have put him on the disabled list, got him some professional help. I guess he just lost it, decided to help himself to Bureau funds, and when he discovered you Washington guys creeping up on him, he freaked and killed himself. Well, okay. - Thanks a lot. - Mmm-mmm. - Thanks for your help, Greg. - No problem. Stay in touch. - You take it easy. - See you. Ruiz, I want you to drop whatever you're doing and get on this kidnapping case. You may have to go to Denver for a day or two. What about Deputy Ray? - Don't worry about that. - All right. Oh, say, does that star-spangled Banner yet wave O'er the land of the free And the home Of the brave Our national anthem! And we are ready to rumble. And here's the first bull ride of the night... Whoo! Look out, Jess Frank. Holy moly. Man, I hope he is okay tonight. He's on his feet, and you can laugh at him, but you gotta respect the job they do, our rodeo clowns and bullfighters. Give them a big round of applause, ladies and gentlemen. A great job they do. Here, in New Mexico, Jess Frank, one of the premier rodeo clowns in bullfighting history... You're more likely to fall out of that grandstand than I am off this horse. I want to go get a good seat. How about a good-luck kiss? Thanks. See you back here at the truck. Yep. We got a kiss, Blade. Thank you. That concludes our bull riding, and it was great ride here tonight. And if you enjoyed it, let's give them a big round of applause, all of our bull riders. We're gonna move from the macho men of bull riding to the event of fast horses and beautiful ladies. Our Cowgirls Cloverleaf Barrel Race. And let's, what do you say, welcome all of these ladies tonight, all of our barrel racers... Excuse me. ...the heartland of America to Wichita, Kansas. We're all set. We're down for Thursday. ...smokin 'em in the Rockies, and rockin 'em in the Smokies. And here she comes around the first turn. And to number two, and to the final turn tonight, it's a dash for cash down the homestretch. Let's go to our next barrel racer here this evening. Well, we need to have Mr. Bob Spencer. Bob, if you're listening, we need to have you check in at our hospitality booth - behind the grandstand. - Let me check this. I'll be right back. Bob Spencer. Let's welcome our next barrel racer tonight. Here is Sally Price from Paris, Arkansas. Here she comes headed for that first turn here tonight... Hi. Uh, I'm Bob Spencer. You paged me. Oh, yes. Oh. Miss! Miss! Oh, it's that redhead girl over there. - She wanted to talk to you. - Okay, thank you. Hi. Uh, you're not the guy I was looking for, okay? I'm sorry, I made a mistake. - Are you Noreen? - Listen, mister. Don't touch me! Your name is Noreen. You were at La Fonda Hotel looking for Bob Spencer. - No! Wait! - Hey, watch it! Noreen, wait! - Noreen, I just want to talk to you! - No! Listen... Listen to me! I'm a friend of Bobby's. I can help you. - You're not with the feds? - No! Okay, okay, but we gotta go someplace safe, all right? I have a car. It's a white Volkswagen. It's right down here. - I think that they followed me. - Who followed you? The feds. They want their money back. The FBI knows where the money is. They told me if I found Bob for them, they would let me off. That's why I came here tonight because Bob loves the rodeo. - Bobby's dead. - Oh, Jesus. Are you sure they were feds? - I knew it wasn't gonna work. - FBI? I told him it wasn't gonna work. I told him that he should just give the money back. What wasn't gonna work? What wasn't gonna work? About ten days ago, Bobby's friend shows up. And he says that they have this plan, right, to get the FBI off our back. And that way... And that way we could stay together and still keep the money. What was the friend's name? It wasn't even Bobby's idea to take the money from the Bureau. He didn't even want the money. He just wanted to be able to stay with me. - What was the friend's name? - I don't know! I don't know. Um... I have a picture, I think, of the three of us somewhere. I don't know. Maybe it's in my car. I don't know. Oh, no. Ray! Hey, Ray! FBI. Internal Affairs. Listen, Deputy, we're not going to arrest you. We just want to ask you some questions. Let's take a ride. Hey! What the hell? - Give me the keys to the truck. - They're in it. What happened? Where's Bob? Gorman, what are you... Wait a minute! Gorman, my horse is tied to the back! What the hell is that? Hey, Ray. You're a hard man to find. We've been looking all over New Mexico for you. Yeah, we didn't expect you to turn up calling yourself Spencer. Maybe you were in on it from the get-go, huh? Maybe you're Artie's accomplice. About four months back, a whole lot of money disappeared from Bureau impound where it was waiting to get used in a trial. - Sound familiar? - I don't know what you're talking about. Yeah, Ray. You don't have to answer that. Yeah, questions. A lot of unanswered questions here, see? Right. We're gonna take you to the police station in Santa Fe. You're not under arrest, so you won't need an attorney unless you've got something to hide. What the hell's that guy doing? Wave him by. What's he doing? Hey, watch out! You guys drunk or what? Oh, my God, what happened to you? - What happened? Where's Gorman? - I don't know. He took off with the truck. He didn't say anything to me, you know? I just want to know what the hell is going on, Bob. You don't even know who I am. Okay. My name is Ray Dolezal. I'm a cop. I've been trying to figure out who killed Bob Spencer. I'm sorry. Get the car. Get the car! He's back. Ray, you all right? What? Who killed that girl tonight? What are we gonna do? We should tell somebody. Look, I think I can keep you out of this. You really haven't done anything. I don't wanna be kept out of this. I care about you. I wanna help you. I don't care about Lennox or your job or the FBI. I care about you. I want you. I'm married, Lane. You want to go back to your wife? Do you need money? I can get you money. You can pay off the feds, make them disappear. I'll get you some money. Oh, God! Oh, yes. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yes! Yeah! Yeah! Oh! Yeah, yeah. Yes! Yes! Oh, God! Yes! Get down, Deputy Ray. Get down. Oh, yes. Oh, thank you! God. Yes! Don't do it! Those two guys at the rodeo were FBI too, right? Hey, hey, it's a big Bureau, lots of headless horsemen. Can I put on my pants? You killed Noreen. You killed Spencer. Well, go ahead, asshole, shoot me. Go on, do it! You think that'll solve your problem? First-degree murder of a federal agent? Go on, do it. My first concern was the integrity of the operation. It was a judgment call. Could have gone either way. - Go outside, Lane. - I'm all right, Ray. Go outside. Wait in the car. The less you know, the better. You drilling her yet, Ray? Did Artie know that money you gave him was stolen? Borrowed. Washington wouldn't fund my Lennox sting so I borrowed some money nobody was using. Artie was a head case. He went ballistic when Internal Affairs started poking around. So, you tracked him down and killed him, and left the money on him and hoped everyone would blame him, right? No, no, no, no, not me. I just told Artie the truth. Your truth. I'm putting on my pants. Jesus! Ray, Ray, Ray. You'll appreciate this story, Ray. When I finally tracked Artie down, he's holed up in your local Longhorn Ranch Motel, waiting to connect with Lennox, courtesy of your friend Lane. His plan has come apart. Reality is setting in. He thought I was gonna save him. I drive us out to nowhere and then I tell him the truth. That his wife Karen knows he's fucking Noreen, and he's fucking Lane. - Well, that's bullshit. - Ask her! Bring Lane in here and ask her if he wasn't in there before you! I tell him that his life is shit and we're both fucked, and there's no way out of it. And then I just handed him the gun. I said, "You go first, buddy." And he shot himself. Mmm-hmm. And I walked back to town. I'm arresting you for the murder of Artie O' Brien. Oh, yeah, yeah. Uh-huh. And they're gonna believe you. What's the picture they're gonna be looking at here, Ray? Small town redneck cop who possibly stole money from the Bureau telling wild ass tales about a respected senior minority agent, who hasn't so much as a bug stain on his record. I'm out of the loop, Ray. Artie's dead. Noreen's fingered you as the accomplice. She's dead. All you've got is a Polaroid, cowboy. Means nothing! It's just another snapshot. If I help you bust Lennox, what happens to me? Then you're a hero. You get to go home to your wife. I tell everybody how Artie stole the money, and you and me took a lemon and made lemonade. It's your only move. You get back to me now, Ray. I'll be here, waiting. Lane? What the hell are you doing here? - Have you seen Lane? - No. You all right? Hey, come on, I want to show you something. They turned this into a working holiday. Can you believe that? That's our tax dollars hard at work. You know, good always triumphs over evil. Hey, come on. Let's see how much they know. Hop in. My number one rule in life is you don't let people intimidate you. Here you go. Payback. You really are a disappointment. I'm working for the FBI. No, you're not. I know who you are. I make calls. I know all about Greg Meeker and his pathetic little scam. I'm C-fucking-IA, Bobby. Meeker doesn't know. Meeker doesn't know shit. He can't touch me. They don't tell him that, though. Officially, I don't exist. I can't. My profit's my reward for selfless service to God and country. No! What's the fuck's wrong with you? I brought these people here for you. These fuckers are the only ones that can connect Artie and the money to you. - Nobody will ever know. - I'll know. Yeah? Well, we're partners. I'm action and you're money. Together, we could be legendary. This isn't about sides. This is about confusion. This is about creating enemies where there aren't any. Hey, man, the whole goddamn world's falling apart. Peace reigns. Freedom reigns. Democracy rules. How are we gonna keep the military industrial complex chugging forward without clear-cut, fucking pit-faced scum-sucking evil breathing down our neck? Hmm? Threatening our very shores. Now my job is to make sure the other side keeps on fighting. Whatever side. I mean, whatever side we're officially not on this year. But that's all water under the bridge. This is it. You helped raise the money with Lane. You came through for me. Yeah. So, let's go. It's all set up. - We'll meet the vendors tomorrow. - No. Get the fuck away from me. You're crazy. I'm not going anywhere with you. Where's the rest of the money? I can't make the deal without Lane's quarter mil. Where is she? Where is she? Hey, you can't win here, Ray. Dealer holds the cards. Oh, look, hey, we'll trade Lane for the cash. She said you had it. I'll see you tomorrow. You can bury 'em if you want. Lane. Lane. Ever hear of the White Sands before, Bob? It's not sand. It's gypsum. Oh, man, not this noise again! We're going for a little ride. They tell me it's easier if you rip it off quick. Oh, shit! You son of a bitch! I'm thinking you're gonna see the light here in about five seconds and you're gonna remember that the only way you can get out of this mess is to help me get Lennox! Guess what, Greg? Lennox is CIA. That's bullshit. Who the fuck told you that? Ray! All right. So what if Lennox is CIA? So what if he's in on this deal with Artie? It's not gonna save your ass! You're losing it, Raymond! You're losing it the same way Artie did! And we both know what happened to Artie! The farther you go down that river, Ray, the harder it is to come back! You listening to me, Ray? Last night, that call I made? FBI Internal Affairs in DC. I told them I'm Artie's accomplice, and I'd meet them here with their money. I don't get it. Lennox killed the two feds who think I'm Artie's accomplice. That means anybody could be Artie's accomplice now, right? Anybody. Like you, for instance. Oh, man. Look, Ray, Ray, Raymond. - Look, don't do this! - I told them to send one guy in. Just one or I'd bolt. My first concern being the integrity of the operation. You know this is not gonna work. You sick son of a bitch! You got lots to think about here, Greg. A lot of choices. You could try to explain everything to your FBI friends. It's a long shot, but after all, you are a senior minority agent without even a bug stain on your record. And then again, you could kill him and take the money and run. You like choices, Greg? I'm glad you got my little clue. Where's Lane? That was the deal. She's down the road, by the entrance. You don't trust me. Where's the money? Oh, it's right in there. Well, why did you put the money in there? I wanted to make sure I had an even chance of getting away. - You understand. - Oh, you're so goddamn cynical. I thought you quit smoking. Well, it looks like I have no will power. You sure the money's in the case? Gorman, I thought we were working from an element of mutual trust here. You're making me sad. Well... Maybe we can hook up again someday. No. Too wild for me. Well, it's all a bunch of bureaucratic bullshit. They have an agenda. I have an agenda. But you know what? It works. Yeah, it's the CIA way. It's a beautiful design. It keeps corruption to a minimum. I'm gonna go while you're in there. Oh, I know. Ray! Ray! Very fucking funny, Ray! Who the fuck else is out there, huh? Ray! I heard gunshots. He's dead, isn't he? Yeah. I guess that's it then. I guess you can give the money back to the donors or find a cause you really believe in. I thought I had. Are you in love with your wife? Yeah, I am. Are you in love with me? I could have been. - Is this yours? - New hat, yeah. - Molly bought it for my birthday. - Molly. Let's see. Looks good on you. Be careful. Go on. Sir, we found our money inside the trunk of the car. Half a million bucks. There's also footprints going back up into the dunes. No! There are days And there are nights When you need some time and distance Well, sometimes That's all you got To see things crystal clear To see everybody's hand You got to fall To make a stand Quicksand and lies It's where the trouble starts There's a big world out there That'll tear your soul apart Truth hides in the shadows And the backrooms and dives That you walk that thin line and believe And it's there you'll survive Quicksand and lies And it's a long, slow slide To where the goal gets lost Smokescreens into words Shattered dreams But not without a cause It's not about taking sides And there's no room for thinking It'll ever be the same And doubletalk, deceit, and deception It's how they play the game Quicksand and lies It's where the trouble starts There's a big world out there That'll tear your soul all apart Truth hides in the shadows And the backrooms and dives And you walk that thin line and believe That it's there you'll survive The quicksand and lies 'Cause without the truth There ain't nothing Nothing but a lie And the lies always grow Feel for the edges to keep from falling You'll live on the inside, oh The quicksand and lies It's where the trouble starts There's a big world out there That'll tear this all apart Truth hides in the shadows And the backrooms and dives And you walk that thin line and believe That it's there you'll survive The quicksand and lies
