(SOFT MUSIC) - ROSE: A long time ago out of the vast darkness, God created this wonderful ride we call life. He filled the world with an abundance of beauty and endless possibilities. And yet we find ourselves questioning his creation and our very own existence. Many people ask themselves why are we put on this earth? What is our purpose? Why must we be challenged? with are we faced with so many heartaches and failures? Why do bad things sometimes happen to the very best of us? And what does God have in store? ♪ This little light of mine ♪ ♪ I'm gonna let it shine ♪ ♪ Let it shine ♪ ♪ Let it shine ♪ - Rosie. ♪ Let it ♪ - Come on. - I don't wanna go. - Come on, we have to. It's for Mommy. (SOFT MUSIC) - Go. - ROSE: My family was my world, my purpose. They kept me alive and smiling. They're a constant reminder of how great God is. My sons Ryan and Tim were the most sacred blessings God has ever bestowed upon me. I was their protector and teacher. I rejoiced when they rejoiced. I hurt when they hurt. I watched them in bewilderment. Clung to them. Did all I could to keep them safe. - Ma, have you gone yet with the hopscotch? - ROSE: No, you. You first. Ryan, aren't we going to say grace? - Is it Thanksgiving already? - Did you really just say that? - GRACE: Yes he did. - Are we gonna have a Bible study or are we gonna eat? - TIM: That's enough, Ryan, you're disappointing mom. - Thank you, Lord, for this food that we are about to receive. Please bless this family. Amen. - Amen. - You see what I saw? - Yeah. - It's too bad. You gonna tell him or you want me to? - I'll do it. - Alright. Let him know I signed off on it. - Will do. You get the email? - I haven't checked. - Give it a look. That's the Goodwin file. - Did Doctor Harris sign off on this? - Yes. - Okay. What do you think? - I think the X-rays speaks for itself. How much time do you think she has? - DOCTOR: She came in too late for time. - Poor thing. - Yeah, she didn't even know she had it. - You want me to? - No. I'll do it. (SOFT MUSIC) Hello, Mister Goodwin. Yes, this is Doctor Sherman. I have the results of your wife's test and I would like you both to come in and see me. I'd rather discuss that with you in person, Mister Goodwin. Okay. Thank you. - ROSE: My poor Ian. With no faith in God, who would he turn to for comfort? That's my boy, Ryan. Company executive, family man. He had it all. But just when you're feeling on top of the world, darkness may be lurking around the corner. - Three. Two. Let's go. Energy, energy. - This is Robbie Martin from Odensoft. I'm calling about our exciting new Gen 1.1 software. - I'm calling to tell you about an exciting new opportunity. It's called Generation 1.1. - You see, that's how a company runs. Companies run on efficiency and Gen 1.1 is exactly it. - This is Robbie from Odensoft. I need to speak to the accountants in charge of acquisition. Hello, hello, hello. - Just let's get on the next call please. - Gen 1.1 Linda. - Gen 1.1, hi my name is Linda. I'm gonna be in your area. I'd like to talk to you about the Gen 1.1. - Anything you need you come to me, okay? - How am I supposed to know? - Gotta keep trying. - Robbie, it's autograph time, buddy. - Jay, how many of these are you gonna ask me to do? - As many as I want. Thank you. Can you just tighten that up a little bit? - If you don't like how I do it, you sign. - Sorry. Please carry on. Thank you. - That's better. - Thought you and Ryan were friends? - 20 years. - These guys don't play fair. They're not altar boys. - Todd, what are they talking about? - Come on, Marty. Sounds like sour grapes to me. - I should give your guys parking spots they're in my territory so much. Old man Rogers. Goodwin and his team. They've been trying to steal the Kaufmann account for a long time. - I wanna see every one of your sales managers. I wanna see your salesmen. I am livid. - Morning boss. - I know your team poached all those accounts. - Come on, Marty. Show me one team that closes deals inside their region strictly. Everybody does it everywhere okay. What's the big deal, Marty? - So who signed the bottom of those accounts, Jay? Who signed off? - Jay. - JAY: What? - Who signed the deals? - That's better. - Hey, you better give me a name or you're getting fired. - Ryan. Look, it was Ryan's idea in the first place. I don't know who signed 'em but it was Ryan's idea. - WOMAN: Mister Goodwin, Todd would like to see you in his office as soon as possible. - Todd's just gonna have to wait a minute. - Todd isn't waiting for anything. Get in the conference now. - What is going on around here? - Peko Instruments, Nondo Cellular, Melville Lumber. What's this all have in common, Ryan? - They're all deals that my team has done in the last few months. What's the problem? - Yeah, those are deals your team did in Long Island outside of your territory. You stole the accounts. - Marty, nobody stole anything. Okay? - Explain yourself, Ryan. - What did Jay have to say about all this? - Let's get him in here. Tell Jay to get in here. - Jay, would you help me out here, please? Explain to Mister English that all of our deals are good. - Mister English, all of our deals are good. - That's nice. You know it's bad enough the economy stinks and we gotta lay people off, and we got salesmen out there just sucking wind, and we cannot put a team together, but you have to assemble a bunch of thieves. - Ryan, if you can't offer me a reasonable explanation for this then my hands are tied - Marty, you know as well, sometimes things get shuffled around, but we always do the right thing. So all the sudden you're gonna come at me and like tell me that this is a problem? - You signed the paperwork. You gave the blessing on all of these accounts. You got Jay Greer with nine of these last quarter. 15 last quarter before that. You got 16 from Tony Vespa. 21 from the Marino brothers. En route to number one in the country. There's a little pattern here. A little thievery pattern. It's your team and it's your signature and it's your job on the line. - ROSE: How quickly sometimes the course of our lives change. Little did Ryan know this was just the beginning of a very rough road for him. - I've been with this company a long time I made you millions of dollars, okay. I've given you everything I have. - You're fired. - Whoa, Marty. You can't fire the best manager in the entire office. - Just did. Why don't you get up and get lost? - Yes sir. - TODD: Ryan, go wait by my office. - Is this really happening? - We have a pamphlet if you like. - Todd, a pamphlet? - It's not your fault. It had to be done. Someone had to take the fall. - I know it's not my fault but me? I'm taking this very personally. In fact, I'm thinking of coming over that desk right now. - Do you want me to call security? That the way you want this to go? Listen, you'll be alright, Ryan. You'll land on your feet. - What happened to you? You're like a Judas. I put this company before my family for the last 26 years. - We have counselors available if you feel like you need to talk to somebody. - That's it? - That's it. - Hey Ryan. You'll be fine. - I'll be fine. (ALARM BUZZING) - ROSE: He felt such disappointment and anger, but chose not to share his struggles with his wife. It was never his way to open up and show his vulnerability. He needed to let us help him. To let us into his heart. ♪ This little light of mine ♪ ♪ I'm gonna let it shine ♪ ♪ This little light of mine ♪ ♪ I'm gonna let it shine ♪ (PHONE RINGING) - Hi, Grace speaking. - Hi Grace. It's Judy Flomer. - Hi Judy. How are you? - I'm fine. I just wanted to see how everyone is. How's Ryan holding up? - We're doing great. Everything's great around here. Kids are great. Ryan's great. - Where is he now? - He's at work. - He got a new job already? That's great news. - You didn't pour my coffee? - I'm on the phone. - What are you talking about? Got a new job? No, he's been working at the office like everyday. - You don't know? Oh. Todd fired Ryan three days ago. I assumed you knew. I'm so sorry. - I'm so confused. He didn't mention anything to me. - I'm so sorry. If there's anything I can do? - Thank you. Bye. Hi honey. - Hey babe. - How was work today? - Good. Great. - What did you do at work? - Same ole, same ole. Why? - Judy Flomer called me asking how I was holding up. I didn't know what she meant until she told me her husband fired you on Monday. You've been putting on that suit and going to work for three days now. - I didn't know how to tell you. - I find out that not only you're out of a job, but you're keeping secrets from me. - That's not what this was about. - ROSE: Ryan's life was spiraling out of control and strain was being placed on his marriage. The one person he needed most was drifting away. - Hey Ry. How's it going, man? - Look at you. Still going for a run even in this weather. - Hey, you know you gotta stay fit, right? - Tell me about it. - So what's going on? You took off of work today? - They let me go. - Get out of here! You worked down there far too long. - So much for loyalty. - So what are you gonna do now? - I'll think of something. - Amen. Good seeing you. - RYAN: You too. - Mommy, how do you play checkers? - You don't know how to play? - No. - REPORTER: In the month of June coming in at one and a half resell. Now as we mentioned earlier-- - Daddy, come and play. - I'm busy, honey. - Come on, Dad. - Kids, go upstairs, please. Please. - MAN: Most people have been expecting this figure. It's just the economy has gone one way. - You could make an effort. Get some rest. You're driving Chris back to school tomorrow. - ROSE: Ryan felt such regret. His children once adored him but now they were so distant. He was no longer their light. He did not know how to connect with them. Their love and admiration seemed a distance memory. - You okay, son? - Just fine, thanks. - You could've fooled me. (SOFT MUSIC) (PHONE RINGING) - Hey buddy what's up? I don't understand. - ROSE: I wished he had never gotten that call. That place was a den of vipers. The callous, cutthroat corporate world was no place for his gentle soul. - Okay, right. I'll see you tomorrow. Thanks. - Who was that? - Jay. They want me to come back to work. They wanna see me in the office tomorrow. - That's good news. - Maybe it's not such great news. I've been demoted to sales. - Honey, that is still good. It's a job. - Absolutely, yes. I'll talk to you in a second. Take care. - Oh! Woo! - Another one. - Absolutely yes. - Bang 'em. - Fantastic. Ooh, looking good baby. - I'll talk to you at one o'clock Tuesday afternoon. Got you. Thanks a lot. Got one. - Hello? Hello? - Just representing an outstanding product from a company called Oden. Who am I speaking with? - Three, two, one. Phones down. How many appointments you got? - MAN: Lucky 13. - 13, my man. Alright. Hey, how many appointments your guy got? - 15. - 15? You closed them? - Yeah. - Very nice. - Well thank you. - Congratulations, welcome. - Thanks. - Very nice. Congratulations. Now beers on you. How many appointments you got? - Six. - One dozen beers. Beers. Very nice. Congrats bro. Come on man. We're superstars here. How many appointments you got? - 10. - 10? Okay, I like that. That a boy. Skinny and fat. How 'bout you? - 22 big bro. - 22.

Which one of you guys here never got a zero on one of your phone blitzes? Mister Perfection. No see, let's be serious. Exactly. - RYAN: Don't worry, sweetheart. The more you do, the easier it gets. - Thank you, Mister Goodwin. It's all about teamwork, guys. We're a family. How about you, Ryan, how many appointments? - Two. - I don't believe you. Tony. - Congratulations, Mister Manager. - Thanks. How many? Give me good news. - 17. - 17. Bang that bell, bro. - Goodnight, guys. - Goodnight, Ryan. - Let me ask you, Ryan. From manager to cubicle, what's that like? - I tell you, Tony, it's kind of hard to remember. - You better start remembering. You gotta make sales. - ROSE: The devil has many faces and many ways to kick you when you're down. - Good luck, Ryan. - ROSE: The last thing Ryan needed at this point in his life was temptation. - You think now we can get that drink? - Maybe, Trace. I'll let you know. - Glad you're back, Ry. - I agree. - Hey buddy. - Good to have you back, man. - Thanks. - Listen, I was in Todd's office for 45 minutes. He almost fired me, too. - Thank you for trying. You've always looked out for me. - What are friends for? Glad you're back. - Thanks buddy. - Tomorrow alright. - Have a goodnight. - You too. (SOFT MUSIC) - Can you have them order two more please? - Two more. - And I think we're okay on everything else. And did you order those samples for the lab? - I did. They said that they would come back in about two weeks. - Two weeks, excellent. - Did you get a chance to look at Rose's file? - I did, yes. - And? - You had a look at the chart, right? - I did but I felt like you might be able to see something that no one else has seen. - Well you saw that the cancer has spread to her brain, her stomach, her lungs, and now it's in her lymph nodes. Unfortunately there's nothing we can do. I give her maybe a few weeks. Maybe a month. - Weeks? There isn't any trials or anything that you can put her in? Anything at all? - It's too late. There's no alternative treatments? She's done. Sorry. - Are you sure? - Maybe if she came a little sooner. I don't understand what your fascination is with this patient. You seem to be taking this very hard. - I'm friends with her son and he's best friends with my husband. She's been my spiritual inspiration for a very long time. - The next thing to do would be to look into hospice care to make-- - No, no hospice. I've been taking care of her this whole time and I'm gonna continue taking care of her. I think she would want that. - Well, I know you're a woman of faith, so I hope that can be of comfort to you. - I think God will provide. - Are you telling, Ryan? - Uh uh. I want nothing to do with that. You should stay out of it, too. Just email Ryan's dad the results. - Okay. Are you going to church Sunday? - I've got a big presentation at the office. - The kids would love to see you though. - I know. The kids would also like to go on vacation more too right? You hold down the fort at church. I'll keep making money. Gotta go. - It's gonna be great this weekend. - I can't wait. - What'd you tell your wife? - Who cares? She doesn't listen to me. She listens to God. She thinks he's a better husband than me. - Apparently. - Let's see. Here we go. - ROSE: I tried to be strong. I didn't want my family to know just how sick I really was. I was the heart of this family. Any pain or sadness I felt, I kept it locked inside of me. - GIRL: Stings. - And then the honeybee says oh no. I'm a honeybee. I pollinate plants that make fruits, vegetables, and nuts. And the little girl says. - But don't you sting? - Man, look at him go. - It's amazing right? - He's unbelievable. I don't know how he does it. - ROSE: The boys admired their dad. He was always calm and thoughtful with them. He had a knack for saying the right thing to the boys while never passing judgment or uttering a hurtful word to them. I sensed that Ryan saw him as a role model that he himself never quite lived up to. - How you guys doing? - Everything's great, pop. - What about you, Ryan? - Doing okay. - I don't think so. - ROSE: A continuing circle of light. - Could I have a word with you please? - Sure Pop. - Tim, excuse us, okay? - You got it, Dad. - It's not as bad as you think. - I never had to deal with anything like this in my life. It's like everything is piling up. - Hi Grandpa. - Hi baby. - It's like they don't even talk to me anymore. - They're of the age of independence of you. It's the way life goes. - Still for me it's like everything's happening all at once. It's like I can't even breathe, you know. Like I'm suffocating. - Ryan, consider yourself lucky, okay? You're gonna be noticing people falling on the right and left of you. Friends of yours are gonna be seeking divorces. - That's easy for you to say. You and mom have been rock solid. - Yes. Yes. Times were easier then, Ryan. A long time ago my grandpa gave me this thing. Look. I was about 10, 12 years old. And now it's a stone. Smooth and polished with life 'cause it was like in a current of a river, and that's how we face life. We try to absorb, look. I'm gonna give this to you 'cause you're rough like a rock now. Like a rock. But you won't get by that way. You have to embrace life, get smooth. Breathe a little bit. You can do it. You don't wanna remain a rock, do you? No, no. You become a polished, articulate stone just like your father (LAUGHS). - Come on. Okay. - Are you sure you know what you're doing? - I think I remember, yes. Call it. - Three, two, one. Blast off. - One second. Ready? - It's okay, Daddy. - TIM: Hey Pop. - Hey. - You still have this? You remember it? (GENTLE MUSIC) - IAN: What you going down memory lane? - I haven't seen this in years. - Remember you and your goofy brother used to fight all the time over this. I tried to glue it together. I think you used to beat him up. - We shot like a million of these. - Time certainly flies. - So what do you got? - MAN: What do you got? Straight up to the six. - MAN: Come on. - Thank you. - Why does Santa always win? - Why is Santa here? - That's not Santa. He just looks like him. - You must've said your prayers last night 'cause you're winning every time. - That's not it. Just better than you guys at poker. - I gotta newsflash for you boys. Prayer has nothing to do with it and God doesn't care who's winning a red chip or a green chip or a blue chip. - You know I agree with you. You know why? 'Cause there is no God. - Whatever You say, Aaron. There is no God. That's fine. - You know, Joe, you're pretty wishy washy. Do you believe or don't you believe? Would you make up your mind? - You know what Santa Claus, give me some proof and I'll believe in God. - You want proof? I'm your proof. You wanna know when I found God exists for a fact? Tet Offensive in 1968. Company got pinned down, surrounded by all sides. Got hit hard every area. While you were selling cars and you were doing God knows whatever it is you do, me and three guys were in a foxhole trying to survive. (BOMB EXPLODING) (GUNS FIRING) - Say a prayer again, Ted. - Our father who art in heaven. Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil. Forever and ever amen. - If you were there, you'd feel it, too. Trust me. Jesus was in my foxhole. Deal!

I don't accept your apology. - Ry, is everything alright? Get it together. - ROSE: My son had hit rock bottom. He could not succeed at work. His marriage was in ruins. His children had lost sight of him. And the one person that loved him unconditionally, who saw his greatness even through his shortcomings, she was dying. I wanted to hold him, to bandage up his bruises like when he was a child, but I was weak and clinging to life myself. The end of my days were approaching. Who would he run to in my absence?

There's the door. - No, you should leave. - Excuse me? Are you kidding me? She just told me to leave my own home! - We're just doing some work alright. You're coming in here screaming. Stay where you are. Don't worry about it. - Jay, you are a horrible, horrible person. You hurt your friends. You hurt me. I will not allow you to hurt our children. - They are my children and this is my house. Get out. - Jay, I have been praying for you for such a long time and this is how you repay me? You bring someone like this in our house. Our house. Do you understand this? - We are just doing some work. - Why Jay? It's clear you're not just doing some work. You haven't been doing some work for a long time, haven't you? Why Jay? - We are working. - God put us together and we are going to stay together. Do you understand that? Jay, come and talk to me.

He needed to save his marriage and his life. God was sending his messages through angels and finally his ears began to open. - What's the matter? - Your friend Jay stopped by. - Well what did he want? - He tried to. - He tried to what? Wait.

Somebody's helping me change the tire right now. - WORM: Really? - I just came in to wash my hands. - WORM: What's going on in your life? - Pretty normal stuff. - WORM: Yeah? - I ain't living like the Worm. I'm married, kids, and I'm in sales. - How many kids you got? - Four. - Whoa. I'm happy for you. Are you happy? - Right now I'm kind of having a tough time. - You know Ryan, my brother. I always had you pegged for being a writer. I remember back in the old days when we were in school in English class, you used to write these fascinating stories. Stories that most people wouldn't believe. I don't know if they were true, or you were making them up, but if I was you, I would seriously, seriously consider getting back into being a writer. You my friend should be a writer. - So I see you're a bit of a spiritual person. - How'd you know? Yes, I am. - My sister in-law's big into God. - Oh, smart girl. - Well, sometimes she gets a little too preachy with everyone. - Would you prefer that she keep it all to herself? - Yeah sometimes. - Sometimes it just comes pouring out. - It's funny you say that. I just ran into an old friend I hadn't seen in about 20 years and he says just the slightest little thing to me and it's like a light went off. - What did he tell you? - It's crazy 'cause things haven't been going my way lately. Facing a lot of challenges. But through a bit of an odd sequence of events, he shares with me that he thinks I should be doing some writing and because of this one in a million coincidence of running into him, he shares something with me that well it's really got me thinking. - There is no coincidence, Ryan. Coincidence is just God's way of remaining anonymous. - ROSE: Ryan had an epiphany. Things suddenly began to make sense. God had filled his heart and his mind and as he took pen to hand, he and the Almighty co-wrote the story of his struggles and his redemption. - WOMAN: You look beautiful, Rose. - So sweet. You're each other's strength. We all are. - RYAN: I'm really scared right now. - Don't be scared. Don't be scared. I don't want you to be scared. It's a natural part of life. I'm okay with it. - RYAN: I'm not okay with it. - Promise me. Promise me that you're going to be happy and you're gonna take care of your family. I can't promise I'm gonna get well but I know one thing. I will never leave you. I'll always be in that heart of yours. Do you believe me? I will. I'll stay right there, crawling right in there. I love you very much. You've been a wonderful son. I'm proud of you. I'm proud of you. Give me a hug. I need a hug. That's my boy. That's my son. I love you. I'm proud of you. - Love you. - ROSE: Love you. - IAN: Could you stay a little bit longer? Please. - ROSE: I hope so. At that moment, Ian seemed more and more distant at every passing moment. His words could no longer reach my ears and I suddenly felt I was in the presence of angels. I knew my mom and dad were now near to me. I could feel them, sense them, remember them. Almost touch them. They were waiting to take my hand. - She's gone. I'm sorry. Gladys, she's gone. Rose is gone. - She can finally rest now. She's at peace. - Thanks. I thought she was gonna be here a little bit longer. Just a little. I don't know what I'm gonna do. - ROSE: Thank you, sweetie, for how you cared for me. You looked at me as your inspiration, but you were actually mine. You showed me that no matter how bleak things are, God never leaves our side. - I don't know what I'm gonna do. - It'll be okay. God has a plan for all of us. Just have faith. ♪ Ave Maria ♪ ♪ Gratia plena ♪ ♪ Maria gratia ♪ - MAN: Is there anyone that would like to say something? ♪ Maria gratia plena ♪ ♪ Ave ♪ ♪ Ave ♪ - So I guess this is the end of the road for mom. For some that may be true. But in honor of her I stand here today in disagreement with that idea. It is through her example of love and life that I have been blessed with the understanding of what matters most. You see mom was a person of faith. With faith comes hope. If you don't have hope in this life, well then you can never truly be happy. So the past year has been, well it's been a living hell. My own kids became strangers to me. I watched my wife drift away from me. I lost that powerful position at my job. A position that I allowed to become the very thing that defined me. I arrived at a place in my life that had become meaningless or hopeless, but then one night God started weaving together a sequence of events that would lead me to an understanding of what I needed to do. You see, even though I thought I was lost, God was with me the whole time weaving together a fabric that would lead me to a place where I knew what I had to do. And I did it. So thanks to mom, to you Dad. To my wife, Grace. My beautiful kids. My friends, my family. I know in my heart that this isn't the end and it isn't the end for my mother. I imagine that somewhere she's running through a field right now. And I say that she's running because now she has been made perfect. She's been healed. Maybe she's sitting with her mom telling her stories about her beautiful grandkids or the 60 wonderful years she spent with her husband. It's true, Dad. Mom could be up in heaven right now saying nothing but nice things about you. And we actually all have the chance to go there, too, but there's more for us to do here first because God has a plan and a purpose for all of our lives. For you too, Dad, to be more of a blessing to your grandchildren. So don't give up, okay, just because mom's gone. We need you now more than ever. And I wanna thank you for showing me how to be a better father and a husband. There's so much more to this life. It all connects. There's no coincidence. It's like a tapestry. Like when you and mom, Dad, went to that dance hall so many years ago. So many other places you could've gone that night, but it was meant to be. And I believe you and mom are gonna be together again. One day. This isn't the end. It's just the beginning. Miss you. Love you a lot. - Knock, knock. Can I have your autograph? - Where did you get that? - JAY: Bobby gave it to me. - He shouldn't have done that. - If you really wrote this, you know you have to have forgiveness. - I don't have to have anything, Jay. - I'm sorry, bro. - So what? In your mind this is the moment where I turn the other cheek? - Look, I was wrong alright. I was dealing with my own problems and I mistook kindness for something else. It's no excuse but I am sorry. - You mean that? - I do. This spoke to me. - Hey Jay. - What's up? - So you know I've forgiven you already, but it doesn't mean I'm gonna be inviting you over for steaks any time soon. - Be good, Ryan. - Hey. - Hey. - About the other night. - Yeah. About the other night. - This is never gonna happen. - What? - Yeah. - Yeah? That's it? - Yeah. Really. (SOFT MUSIC) By the way, thanks for all the prayers. You were right. - Thanks. I knew you'd come around. - ROSE: Ryan found the Lord, but inside there was still emptiness as he worried about his dad who was now even more distant from God after losing the love of his life, but miracles do happen. As my husband entered that church, I don't know if I was more proud of Ian for the huge step he was taking or of Ryan for leading his dad back to God. - Ryan. - Hey Pop. - Hey son, I really like what you said at Mom's funeral, especially being a blessing for the grandchildren, and for me to find a little more faith. Thank you, son.
