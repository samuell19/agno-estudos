-Wow. All out for Birchlake Camp. Yippee! -Birchlake, Birchlake, here I come! -Say, who's got my bazooka? -I got it. -OK. -I'm gonna toss it in the lake. -Here's your paper, Mr. Selden. -Well, thanks. Whole bunch of kids, where are they going? -Camp. Just across the lake from your place. -Get your luggage on the truck and we'll hike to camp. Go ahead! -Just look at them. Not a worry in the world. -Great to be a kid. -Now, boys, I'd like to call on our old friend and camp director, Dr. Stevens. -Men of Birchlake, welcome. To those of you who are newcomers, just let me say that our motto always has been and always will be-- a healthy mind in a healthy body. This God-given country that you see around you is our to enjoy. This is your camp, your summer, your vacation. And I want you to make the most of it. -Just one thing more. The big trip this summer will start a week earlier than usual. And boys, I have a grand surprise for you. Instead of a hike this year, we are going to go on horseback. -One night of this trip will be spent in Canada. -Now, I know that you'd all like to get out of your city clothes as soon as possible, so I won't take up any more of your time. Good luck and go to it! -Hey. What's he doing that for, Bud? -Leave it to Chunky. He'll pick the best bed. -OK, fellas, this is mine. -Better be careful, Bud, or you're going to run out of fill-ums. -I wouldn't disturb him. A man's home is his castle. -Maybe he's a lady. -Hey, fellas-- get a load of this trunk! -Hotel Lido, Venice. -Navarro Hotel, Madrid. -Alexandra Hotel, Berlin. -Clandon Hotel, London I. -Where'd you get the trunk, kid? -It's my mother's -What is she, an explorer? -No. My mother's a singer. -Ooh. -Did your father let you too? -He was, but he's been dead for four years. -Where's your mother off to now? -No place. She doesn't sing on the stage anymore. -Swimming time! -Put a wiggle on, gang. Everyone down at the lake. -Come on! -Hey, anybody got an extra belt? -Nope. -Not I. -I haven't got any. -Me neither. -Why don't you tie it in a knot? -Remember, boys, no playing sits in the water. And no one swims past the float. All right? -Yeah! -All right, go ahead! Hello? Hello? Yes? Oh, just a moment, please. Mr. Selden, Mr. Selden-- the phone, sir. -Answer it, will you, Joseph? -But I did, sir. It's for you. Long distance. -If it's from New York, I'm not in. -It's Mr. Wagner, sir. -I'm out. -This is the fifth time he's called today, and for the tenth time I've said you're out. -But, um, Mr. Wagner-- but I tell you I don't know. Upon my word. Mr. Selden, he insists on knowing. Where shall I say you are? -Oh, under a haystack fast asleep-- anything you like. MR. WAGNER : Tell Selden that I must know without further delay when I can have the first act. -Mr. Selden, he wants to know when he can have at least the first act of the operetta. -Just as soon as I get an idea. But don't tell him that. Tell Mr. Selden this is to be an early fall production. At the rate he's going, it won't be ready for Christmas! -Mr. Selden. He says it is scheduled for an early fall opening, not for Christmas. Tell him he has to stop to the phone when I get him. I'll tear up my option with him. -He wants to know what you've been doing for the last three months. -Eating, sleeping, drinking. Getting fish, cows, horses, fertilizer. And building a new back porch. -Yes, sir? Let him finish my operetta, he can hold as much as he likes. -That's good. Yes, I'll tell him. Mr. Selden! I-- I beg your pardon, sir. But I think you'll find your problem practically solved if you'll accept my help. -Well, thank you, Joseph. What do you suggest? Plug or spinner? -Spin-- uh-- no, no, no. I wasn't thinking of fishing, sir. I refer to your difficulty in getting down to work. You see, Mr. Selden, as I said before-- -Yes, Joseph, as you said before-- you didn't place your services with me just to open doors and wait on table. But someday, you hope to help create great music. -That's right, sir. -Unfortunately, Joseph, all the great music has already been written. -Oh. -You and I were born too late. -Now, really, sir. Why, last night I had a new inspiration. The rhymes just kept running through my head. I-- I, I couldn't sleep. -Have you a light, Joseph? -Yes, sir. Now, sir, as I was saying-- -Joseph, I've a better idea. You do the composing, and I'll do the butlering. -Hello, Brennan! -How's tricks, Moreta? -The tricks, they're OK. But the songs-- -How's your operetta coming along, pal? The trouble with writing a hit like your last one-- you got your work cut out now to try and top it. -I'm afraid so. Well, good luck. -What he have that we no got? -A producer. -And the band. But I ask you, did you ever write anything so good as "I'm Glad I'm Mad About You?" -No, Moreta, that was a great number-- even if we were the only ones that ever heard it. -How are you, gentlemen. -No-- no, we're not interested in collaborating with you. -I come to talk business. You boys write good songs. -Well, we're too anemic to blush. -You've been up here in this musical colony all summer and a part of the spring. I have my finger on your difficulty. You write the wrong kind of song. Yeah, we know that, teacher. -Write songs with me, gentlemen, and I assure you, our efforts will be crowned with-- -Success. -Fame and success. -How many songs have you had on Broadway? -Gentlemen, I've been unfortunate. The world accepts me only as a butler, when I have the soul of a poet. Hey, Mister! Those are mine! -Thought a sturgeon was a new kind of fish. How you lose them? -Lost the belt. -Catch! -Thanks! -Have a safety pin? -No, I'm afraid not. Oh, wait a minute-- maybe this will fix you up. -Gee, thanks. How's the fishing? -Swell. -Get anything? -Sure. -Let's see. Kind of small, aren't they? -Well, I've only been fishing for a little while. -Hey, it's keen up here, isn't it? -I'll say. Over in the boys' camp? -Yes, sir. What's your name? -Chip. -Chip, eh? Chip what? -Chip Winters. What's yours? -Johnny. -Johnny what? -Johnny Selden. -I'm pleased to meet you, Mr. Selden. -Pleased to meet you, Mr. Winters. -Hey, you over there! Come back here! -All right, all right, I'm coming! Yeah, called out about swimming past the float. Well, so long! Oh, wait a minute-- uh, how do I get your pin back? -Aw, come across and fish here. I'd like to see you at camp. -OK, swell. Bye! -Bye! -Bye! -Good night, Joseph. -Good night. -Oh, hello, Mr. Selden. -Hi. -I didn't see you. -Hello, Chip. -This is Pee Wee. -Hello! -Hello, Pee Wee, -Oh, uh, here's your license. I was gonna bring it over as soon as I had gotten across the lake. -Thanks. I shan't be wanting it for a while. I've down at Wizard Lodge. -What? You're on vacation time? -No. This isn't vacation time for me, Pee Wee. I've gotta dig. -Oh, you're a farmer. -Well, in a way, yes. I, uh, I dig for tunes, and uh, I grow music. -Do you sing like Chip? -Oh. So it was you who sang last night. -Yes, sir. -I wish I could sing like Chip. -Oh, you ought to hear my mother sing. -How do you compose? May want to make a wish! -Come on, Mr. Selden, tell us. How do you compose? -Well, first I get an inspiration. Then I sit down to the piano, wait for the music to come to a boil inside me, and then let it bubble all over the keys. -Gee, you say funny things just like my mother writes. Listen. "After leaving you at the train, I walked home through the park, pretending it was a lovely country you were going to. And suddenly I remembered something I forgot to tell you about all these years you've been growing up. It's about the little things in life. How the bluebird in flight is such a quick moment of beauty that you must look sharp to catch the blue flash." -Those are very beautiful images. Your mother has imagination. Is the letter full of thoughts like that? -Mm-hmm. -Oh, really-- may I? -Sure. -"Learn every song in the concerto that a brook or a waterfall makes, or that is played by the little emeralds splashing the still lake." You know, fellas, I can feel something beginning to boil. See you later. -Did you ever feel anything boiling inside of you? -Huh-unh. -Oh, boy! I'm so glad I catch a fish! Come here. -That's a small one. -Oh, boy. -Here, let me help you. -Mail! -Oh, please have something for me this time! -I haven't had a letter in two weeks! -I'm expecting a package. -I'm expecting some film. Got any? -Well, take it easy, boys, take it easy. All right, gang, let's have a little order here. Leave room. There you are. -Archers. -Here! Thanks, Uncle Bill. -Mayers? -Here. Thank you, Uncle Bill. -Winters? -Here. Thanks, Uncle Bill. -Thompson. -Here. -Hi there! -Oh, hello, Mr. Selden. -Another letter? -Mm-hmm. My mother's coming. -Well. You don't sound very cheerful about it. -You wouldn't either if somebody was coming up to spoil your fun. -What? -Oh, I don't mean my mother. Look who's coming along. -Who's Mr. Mays? -Oh, he's the one who talked my mother into giving up singing. -Oh. He doesn't like singing, eh? -It isn't that. He just doesn't want my mother on the stage. He's always saying it's for our own good. Mother says he's very reliable and substantial. Gee, I wish I could think he was swell. I guess my mother thinks he is. I don't know. Why does he have to come up here, anyway? He doesn't like any of the things kids do. I bet he never went fishing in his whole life. He's different-- from us, I mean. You know something, Mr. Selden? -What, Chip? -Won't be any more letters after my mother comes up here. -I was just thinking of that, too. Chip! Chip. having her kids! -Boss, what's up? - Come on! having her kids! Hey, Chip! Your letter! -Let me see! -Come on! -Aw, get out of the way. -One! Two! Three! Four! Five! -Quinpuplets! -Hold it, fellas! -Hey, Bud, how do you spell quinpuplets? -Ask Chip. -Quinpuplets? Q-U-- hey, Chunky, how do you spell quinpuplets? -K, uh-- -No, we got as far as Q-U. -Judge, how do you spell quintuplets? -Spell it exactly the way you say it. -Just say five of them. -Gentlemen. Just a moment, please. No question that our money. -Listen, boys. The musical world has had father songs, mother songs, also brother songs. But what is it the musical world has never had? A sister song. And I have it. Listen to this lyric. -Would it distract you too much if I were to cut my throat while you're wailing? -No, not at all. Now, please. "I want you to meet my sister, mister. You'd make a peach of a pair." Peach of a pear-- rather neat, isn't it? "And you'd realize after you kissed her, mister, that she had done her share. I know you'd love my sister, mister. My sister's name is Susie." I'm having a little trouble rhyming Susie. -Joseph. Did you say the musical world had never had a sister song? -Never. -You told the truth. -Yay! -Woo-hoo! -Yay! -All right. All bail. -Come with me to get my landing! Away! -A three-point landing. -Woo! -Shh! -Hello, Mr. Joseph! -Hi, Mr. Joseph! -Boys, come, come. Mr. Selden is very busy. He must not be disturbed today. -Aw, gee. I wanted to ask him to go on a treasure hunt with us. -You've bothered him enough. He's way behind in his work, and he can't spare a moment now. -All right. Come on, gang! -Hello, fellows! -Hi! -Hello, Mr. Selden! -Hi! -Hi, Mr. Selden! -Where you going? -High tailing it to look out on an expedition. -And you're leaving me out? -Want to come along? -What sort of expedition is this? -Treasure hunt. Only it's got to be some natural thing in nature that's the treasure. -It's nothing for it's intrinsic value, sir. -Animal, vegetable, mineral-- or just plain inanimate! Aw, come on in for a minute. -Haven't got time! -Yeah! -Aw, come on in, just for a minute. -You can go in if you wanna, but we gotta get back in time for swimming. -OK. I'll catch up with you fellows. -Mr. Joseph? Hold it a minute, will you? Thanks a lot. -I wish you'd let me see it when the prints are finished. -Sure! -If you do, I'll autograph it for you. -OK. -Something they have at camp every year. Each of the fellows has to give his mother or father a treasure. But it can't be anything you make. You've got to find it. Do you think I ought to give something to Mr. Mays? Well, I'll just find something for my mother first. -I know something you can give your mother. -You do? -Mm-hmm. If you can guess what it is, you can have it. -What is it? -It's something you can give and still have. It's something you can give to everybody and still have it. You can carry it with you wherever you go. It's good when you're glad, and when you're sad. Now, what is it? -Glad, sad, Give, have. -Give up? -I give up. -"Make a wish, you and I, that this lovely dream of ours will never die." -It's a song. -And you're leaning right on it. -It's nice. Did you just write it? -Mm-hmm. -"I'll make a wish over my shoulder each time the moon appears. That when we grow older--" -Try it. Go on. This is my mother. -How do you do? -This is my mother. -How do you do? -How do you do? -Now I want you to meet two of my best friends. This is Pee Wee, this is Judge. And this is my mother. -Hello, Pee Wee. My, you're much bigger than I thought you were from Chip's letters. How do you do, Judge? -I'm very charmed to meet you, Mrs. Winters. -Don't tire your mother, Charles. -Oh, I'm enjoying it. -Chunky, meet my mother. -Glad to know you, Chunky. -Hello, Mrs. Winters. -Come on, Mother. Now I'm going to take you up the hill. From there you can see the whole music colony. -You see that house behind that big tree? That's Mr. Selden's. And the house right next to it is where Moreta and Brennan live. They've been helping us with our big show. Wait till you see it, Mother. They're composers, too. But not like Mr. Selden. -What do you mean they're not like Mr. Selden? -You know what Mr. Selden said about music? He said that it's got to come to a boil inside of him. And then it bubbles over. At first, his operetta wouldn't boil at all. But now it's boiling fine. Boiled, bubbled up to the finish of the second act. -Yes, Mr. Mays, we have short talks on ethics-- one each week. -Once a week? Do you think that's sufficient? -Well, it isn't a simple matter to make the subject of ethics both useful and pleasant for small boys. -Well, I see. -Sometimes he says some of the funniest things, but you aren't sure whether you're supposed to laugh or not. -For instance? -Well, the other day he said something about having so many selves. And the one he liked best, he called Johnny. He says he hasn't liked himself since he became John. -I must meet this interesting friend of yours, Chip. -You bet you will. Charles. -Yes, sir? -Where is your mother? -She broke the heel off her shoe, and Mr. Selden had to row her across the lake. And we sure had fun. -Oh, and what did you do that was funny? -Oh, we walked and laughed, and, well, we just had fun. -You and this Mr. Selden, you seem to have struck up quite a friendship. -Yes, sir. Excuse me, I've got to get ready for lunch. -Tell me about this operetta you're writing. -You may not know it, but you wrote it for me. -I did? -Yes. I got the idea from the things you wrote in your letters to Chip. -Oh, yes. Speaking of letters-- -Oh, please forgive me. But you have to find a story before you can write one. -And is your operetta all about not catching cold, and being careful about wet shoes? No. No, it's about a beautiful lady high up in the hills. It's in a magical land. No matter how hard you look, you can't find it. -And the lady? -She wanders through the hills singing a song. And whoever hears this song cannot resist it. They must follow her. The song cannot be heard by everybody-- only those who are pure of heart can see and hear her. That means little children. -Mm-hmm. -And all the little children follow her into the hills-- a kind of lady Pied Piper of Hamelin. -Go on. -But there comes a time when she wants them to return and spread the happiness she has taught them among the mad crowd in the valley below. But she can't release them, and the spell cannot be broken until the right man comes to claim the lady. -Well, that won't be easy. -No, but, uh, there is a man in the valley below who is trying to recapture his youth. He's lost it. -Poor man. -Yes. I felt sorry for him too at times. Then a terrible thing happens. The wrong man goes to claim the lady. There always has to be an obstacle in a love story, you know. -And then? -Well, the last act isn't written yet. -Well, here we are. Now, the lady's shoe. You may not know it, but I'm the second-best shoemaker in the world. -Why didn't we think of that before? -I did. -Careful, now. -Thanks a lot for a lovely afternoon. And I hope your operetta will be a huge success. -Cross your fingers. Make a wish. I want this one! -If you kids want any more pictures, it will have to be cash. -I'm in for a dime. -How about you, Chip? -OK, as soon as I get my allowance. I'm broke right now. -What do you mean, you're broke? -I bought a piece of Mr. Selden's show. I've got $1.65 of it. What do you mean, Chip? -Well, if the show's a hit, I'm liable to get $1,000 for my share alone. -Do you mean to tell me you invested $1.65 in a stage production? -Mm-hmm. -What assurance have you that it's going to be good? -I know all the songs, don't I? And they're swell. -Have you got anything in writing? -Why, no. -Aw, come on. You're always talking about Selden's show. It's a wonder you wouldn't take a little more interest in our show. -Well, what's the matter with our show? We're all set. And everybody knows their part. -The costumes came today. I saw them, and they're swell. -Oh, come on, Wagner. Why don't you stay over? The kids are putting on their annual show tonight. We'll have a great time. -Well, that's the trouble with you. You've been having too much of a good time. It's lucky I came up here, or I wouldn't have received these two acts. -You like them, don't you? -Frankly, John, I think it's the finest piece of work you've ever turned out. And if the third act holds up-- uh, give me a little idea what it is? -No, I'm not going to let you hear it until it's finished. -Oh. -Hey, Mister! You better get started if you want to make that train. -All right. All right. You know, John, that show has a great part for Pauline Manners. -Oh, I, uh, I had someone else in mind. -Who? -Miss Irene Winters. -Who's Irene Winters? -She has the most glorious voice you ever heard, and she's very beautiful. -Oh. Well, we'll see. -You're not worrying about your investment, are you? -I'll tell you how I feel about that. I'll buy your half interest right now. -No, sir. I'm into my half as we agreed. -Well, you know show business, John. It's risky. If this thing doesn't go, you'll lose your shirt. -Well, it's my shirt, isn't it? -Now, don't hold me up on that last act. I'm going into rehearsal right away. Now, now you will do a little work tonight, won't you? -No, not tonight. I'm going across to the boys' show. -Well, keep up the good work. So long. -So long. -OK. -Hello. Good evening. -Good evening. -Sorry to shove in so late. I was detained making some important provisions for your future. -My future? -Mm-hmm. -I don't understand. -You will in time. -Perhaps, my dear, you should be persuaded to use this now. -Come on, baby. -Whoa there, boy. -Oh, boy. -You gotta give me credit, this was my idea to get acquainted with the horses. -You mean get the horses acquainted with us. -Hey, what are you kids trying to do? -Well, we thought if we'd feed the horses, they'd get to like us. -Well, that's a good idea. -Dr. Stevens? -Yes. -Could I ride that horse tomorrow? -Well, why not? -Oh, boy! -Can I ride the other one? -Why, certainly. Take your pick. -What's his name? -Why, that's the Lady Jane. -Gee. I'm gonna bring Lady Jane an apple after dinner. -Do you boys know what you're going to do after dinner? You are going to bed. You've got a hard day ahead of you tomorrow. -Yes, sir! -Yes, sir. -Yes, sir. -All right then, run along. -Bye, Lady Jane! -And don't forget, boys-- I want you all asleep not later than 8 o'clock. -OK! -Whoa, Lady Jane. Nice horsie. Giddy up, giddy up. Giddy up, giddy up. -Look out! -Where were you, Pee Wee? -Canada. -Well, you better get back to sleep again, because we've got to get an early start tomorrow. Canada. I wonder what it looks like. -I'm of the impression it's the same as it is here. -Just think, fellas-- we're going to a foreign country! -Did you hear what Dr. Stevens said? We're gonna pitch camp at Moose Head Lake and get a mess of trout for supper. -Oh, boy, I can hardly wait! Let's get back to sleep. -Come on, fellas. We gotta dig up some worms. -How come you didn't go to Selden's party tonight? I thought you and him were such great pals. -Well, if you must know, on my council, Chip decided to retire early. -I told Wagner that I'd found my prima donna. -But I've given up all thought of the stage. I'm making a new life for Chip and myself. -And Mr. Mays represents that new life? -Yes. Mr. Mays represents that new life. -But Irene, you have talent. Don't throw it away. -Johnny Selden! Come on! -Well. What shall it be? -Won't you please play something from your operetta? -Oh, yes. -Come on. -Please do. -All right. But not because I wrote it. Only because Miss Irene Winters has consented to sing it. -Lovely evening, Mr. Selden. And I especially enjoyed Miss Winters' singing. -Grand evening, John. -Good night. -Good night. This was lovely. Thank you so very much. -I think it's the loveliest song I ever heard. -It was written for you. Oh, can't you see how necessary you are-- -Good night, Selden. -Must you go? -Oh, it's late, I'm afraid. -Oh yes, it's very late. -Joseph! -What, sir? -Joseph, I feel marvelous! -Do you, sir? -Yes. How do you feel? -I feel like Helen Morgan. -I'll get you a drink. What shall it be? -Thank you, sir, I'm not very thirsty. -Oh, don't worry. It's on the house. Straight or with soda? -Straight. -Then straight it shall be. Now, Joseph-- before drinking, I want your cold, critical judgement. -A gorgeous voice. -Oh, what charm, what poise! -What quality! Mr. Selden, would you mind please-- -Oh, yes. Pardon me. Joseph, remind me to give you a raise. -Oh, thank you, sir. -Sing well? -Your voice is always beautiful. Irene, I hope all this silly applause isn't going to-- all this pleasant excitement is only part of it. You know that. You know too much about it to be taken in again, I hope. You know, I've been thinking about all this, but I may as well speak frankly. Either you mean it when you say that you're through with this kind of life or you don't And you intend to go through with our marriage or you don't. Which is it, Irene? -Walter, let's leave in the morning. -All right. You know, I think we'd better take Chip with us. -Why Chip? -Oh, he's been up here long enough. Besides, it would be rather nice to have him with us the rest of the summer. You know, I've hardly had a chance to get to know the boy. -Yes, but-- but he has his heart set on that trip. Oh, it means so much to him, and-- -Oh, I can make it up to him in a thousand different ways. In fact, I'd rather like the chance to. Well, Irene, do we all leave together in the morning? -Yes. We'll leave in the morning. -Joseph? Joseph. -Yes, sir. -Pack my things. -Yes, sir. Where are you going, sir? -Oh, the world is wide and the world is round. -Yes, sir. -Say, Joseph, this is the third act. Take it to New York and give it to Mr. Wagner. -What shall I tell him, sir? -That you don't know where I am, that I shan't be at rehearsals, and I don't care if I never hear a note of this music again. About the prima donna, tell him I lost her. -Well, what is it? Head or tails? -Tails. -No peek-a, please. -Aw, I do win. What are you gonna have? -The yolk. -Gentlemen. -Have you got a cup of coffee in your pocket? -No, no, no. Please, gentlemen, I'm serious. -So we see. -The key to fame. -That's a terrible title. -That's worse than your "Mister, Mister, My Sister." -This is the third act of Mr. Selden's operetta. I'm taking this to New York. -So what? -If you will collaborate with me, we can improve on Mr. Selden's work. -Oh, Selden would love that. -No, Mr. Selden doesn't want to hear a note of this music again. He's gone away-- maybe for a long time. -Well, what's the matter, he don't like his own music? -Mr. Selden's had a great tragedy in his life. I can't speak of it now. -Well, don't you think he'll come back? -Definitely not before the show opens. Gentlemen, we can interpolate our own songs. -I don't want nobody to impercolate-a with my music! -No, no, no, no. He means put our songs in the show. -Well, why he not mean-a what he say? What do you think? -Well, what have we got to lose? -And everything to gain. -And that is right. The key to fame. -That's-a no good, boys. That's got two collars over two horses. This operetta's got to be all together one horse! -Oh, hold your horses. Listen, if we get two of our songs in this third act, we're all set. -Here's an excellent opportunity for our first song. -Where? Where? -Boys, we are making musical history. Last call for dinner. -The last man in the dining car pays the ticket. -Where's Mother? -Oh, she's downtown having lunch with Mr. Mays. -Oh. Clara? -Yes, Chip? -What do you think of Mr. Mays? -I think Mr. Mays is a very elegant and important man. -I know, but-- but do you think he's a-- a swell guy? -One never speaks of an important man like Mr. Mays as being a swell guy. -Well, there's a kid up at camp who's got a stepfather, and he said he turned out all right. Only he's a mail pilot, though. Clara? -Yes, Chip? -I've been doing a lot of thinking lately. -About what? -About my friend Mr. Selden. Gee, he could write swell music. He was regular. Did I tell you I've got $1.65 in his show? -Only about 20 times. -It's called "Music In My Heart." -Ah, I know that, too. -I'm gonna see that you go to the show with us opening night. Gee, I bet it will be great. -Woe is me! Woe is me. -What's a matter-- can't you take it? You got us Into this. -It's all your fault. -I didn't realize this would be so serious. Poor Mr. Selden. What are we going to do? -You can't get songs on Broadway, pal, without a little trouble. -I don't want my songs on Broadway anymore. -Well, this is a fine time to talk about that now. Don't you realize you have an obligation? You got us into this, and you can't run out on us now, Joseph. -What are we going to do about the third act, Mr. Wagner? -I've got $25,000 worth of costumes and 100 kids on my hands. -And I've got all the kids up in the mountains, but how am I going to get them out again? -Keep on postponing rehearsals. -And what about the scenery? -And what about the libretto, and the music, and the author? If I could only get hold of him, I could tell you. -Mr. Wagner-- -Oh, don't bother me. -This is important. -Well, who's it from? -Your prima donna. -What does she want? -She regrets exceedingly, but she can't wait any longer. She's accepted another engagement. -Hm. Well, that about washes us up! What am I going to do about Selden? Everything he owns in the world is invested in this show. And I don't know where he is. -I think you've gone as far as you can with Selden. It's about time you thought of yourself. -I'll have to. Oh, if I only had some idea of what the last act is about. -Who is it? -Paul. -Come in! -Where do I put the stuff? -Well, today being Thursday-- the kitchen's day off-- put it anywhere you want it. It's gonna be a great third act. Now, come on-- the music! Come on, come on, now. -Now I remember. This is where the children walk down the mountain. -I got a better idea. Why have them walk? Let's put in an escalator. It'll be something new, novel, extraordinary! -Es-- esca-- esca what? -You know, one of those moving stairs? -Gentlemen, please! -And we'll have the principals on pogo sticks run away to elope in kiddie cars. -That's-a great! All the children in the es-- es-- I mean, in the moving staircase-a, traveling with my music. -What's wrong with that? -I'm beginning to see what you mean. It's so different from Mr. Selden's conception. -It's fantastic! -It's-a symbolic! -It's nuts! -It's-- -Oh, Clara? -Yes, ma'am? -You're setting an extra place for Mr. Mays, aren't you? -Yes, ma'am. -Hello, my dear. -Hello, Walter. You're early. -Yes, I know. -Thank you. -Good afternoon, Charles. -Hello, Mr. Mays. -They're lovely! -I'm so glad you like them. It's a good thing you didn't go into Selden's operetta, Irene. There's a little item here on the dramas page of this morning's theater I thought might interest you. "John Selden's operetta, scheduled to open at the Lyceum, is a project in difficulties. The prima donna, Miss Pauline Manners, has walked out on the show. Can John Selden be slipping?" -Does that mean that there's somebody that doesn't like Mr. Selden's music? -You can see for yourself, my dear, how wise you were to get out of it. -I'll bet if you'd have sung it, mother, they'd have liked it. -I don't think it would have made a bit of difference if you had sung it. [CHIP HUMMING} -Must you always sing? -Clara. Do you know what Mr. Mays read in the paper? -Yes. Looks like you've lost your $1.65, Chip. -Oh, I don't care about that. But I think my mother's kind of sorry she didn't go in it. -I think he is too, Chip. -But I bet if Mr. Selden asked her again, she'd do it. -Yes. But if your mother ever went into that show, Mr. Mays wouldn't ever marry her. -He wouldn't? -Wagner Productions. No, I don't know when rehearsals will resume. All children must pass the clerk. -I would like to see Mr. Selden. -So would everybody else. Wagner Productions. Just a moment, please. I'll connect you. -No more kids needed. -But I want to see Mr. Selden! -You don't say so? Go on, run along. -Excuse me-- could you please tell me where I could find Mr. Selden? -Ask the information clerk. -I did. -One thing I can't understand-- Selden hasn't been around to a single rehearsal. Kind of funny, isn't it? -What's the difference? If the third act's as good as the first two, it ought to be all right. -I think it was just delivered to Wagner a little while ago. -And now, the grand aria. The gloom in my heart because you've been away, the gloom in my heart would be part if you'd stay. The sun in shining clear if you are only near. The clouds, the moon seem bright as soon as you're in sight. Your smile chase the gloom far away. "Music In My Heart." Selden should have written the last act first. -Are you Mr. Wagner? -Thank goodness, no! -But that's not-- -No more children! -Something's wrong. -Looks like it. Did you hear what Grant said? -But that's not Mr. Selden's music! Can I see Mr. Wagner? -Will you quit annoying me? -But that's not Mr. Selden's music! -So what? Now, get out of here and quit bothering everybody. -No, Mrs. Connell, he's very busy. He'll call you back. Yes, young man-- what can I do for you? -Can I see Mr. Wagner? It's very important. -Have you an appointment? -No, ma'am, but-- -I'm sorry, all the children's parts have been cast. -But I've just gotta see Mr. Wagner! Please! As soon as you're in sight. -Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! -Oh, no. -Selden must be insane. You call that music? -No. -Uh, I can explain. -You've explained enough. Now, get out! Get out! Get out and stay out! -Now, what's-a matter? He no like-a the music-a? -This is terrible-a-- this is terrible. -I told you it wasn't so easy to get a song on Broadway. -That's a goodbye, "Mister, Mister, My Sister." -Please, won't you let me in, just for a minute? -I'm sorry, you can't go in. -I thought I told you to go home. Run along. Outside. -But they were playing the wrong music! -Come on! -I tell ya, there's something wrong! Something's wrong, I tell ya! -Barbara. Tell Grant everything is finished. They really came out a wreck. Post a notice, the show's cancelled. -Now, you're gonna get out of here, and you're gonna stay out. -You mean, the show was close? -What? -No! It can't be closed! Please! -Hey, you! -Yes? What is it? There's music in my heart playing just for you-- -That's about enough out of you! -But Mister! Mr. Wagner's gotta listen to it! There's music in my heart playing just for you. -What's going on here? What's the meaning of all this? -Are you Mr. Wagner? -Yes. What's this all about? -Well, he was-- -Look, Mr. Wagner. That wasn't the third act you were listening to. My mother-- Irene Winters-- she knows all the songs, and the aria, and everything! Mr. Selden wrote it for her, honest, he did. And I-- I know it perfectly! Would you like to hear it? Bravo! Bravo! Well, he was certainly right about you, Miss Winters. You're both going to help me out, aren't you? -Mr. Wagner. I'm sorry, but we've given you all the help that we can. -Miss Winters, this is going to be a great triumph for you. I'm sure of it. -And Mother, Mr. Selden wanted you to sing it! -Irene, I think you know exactly how I feel about this. -But wasn't this written for you? -Make up your mind, Irene. -Come in? -John! Why, where have you been? -Anywhere, everywhere-- I don't know. What does it matter? When I heard that you were going to sing, I couldn't stay away. I had to come back. Wonderful Irene. Wagner told me everything.
