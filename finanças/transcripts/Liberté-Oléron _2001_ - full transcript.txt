Boys! Nearly there. You'll see the sea soon. On the left. It's holiday time! Three little kittens, tens, tens... Tens and twelves, elves, elves... Elves and leprechauns, corns, corns... Corns on my toes, toes, toes... Toes and feet, feet, feet... Feature film, film, film... Film star, star, star... What's this thing? A swan... Bloody ugly duckling. Pain in the ass... Why won't it inflate? I don't get it. You buy these things... and they don't work. It's no use. Need anything inflated? Thanks for the offer. I'm useless. Give me a ball. - Throw it properly. - That's pathetic! Go on, your turn. - Not me yet? - Hold on, Nono. Your turn next. Come on, you big lummox. You cheated! Send it back. Send it back now. Keep it straight. Fun, isn't it? What a joke. Okay, here we go. Let's try it again. Ready for lift-off. Watch this... Look out! I'm sorry. Excuse us. It's only water. Captain dad to ship's boy Nono. Launch submarine. There. Come here, you can start it. Here, put this on. Try the left one. Go on. Bear to starboard! - Ready to dive? - Okay. Immersion! Bloody hell... See how it dived? It's gone and vanished. Okay, bring it back up now. I'm trying... Oh, shit... Dad. I don't believe it. - The remote... - Submarine to surface... We haven't lost it. The little bugger will come back up. - It's sunk. - No... A 500-franc submarine doesn't sink like that. Favorite submarine... Don't be too hopeful, okay? You'd best forget it. They flog these things at 500 francs! Come on, you two lumps. Where are those clowns? Get down. You're not allowed on that boat. Wow! Have you seen this thing? Not bad at all. What a boat. - You bet. - The Wind Jet 42 is wider. With mum and the mortgage, it won't be easy. Flaming flipper... You know, puppy, the submarine's a long way away now. Where? Probably that island there. Can we go and get it? Yes, we'll go. One day maybe. - Up on your feet! - The Gulls are neat! The club's not tacky. The group leader's perfect. - You'll get your bronze gull. - I don't need it! - Late, are we, sonny? - A little. - Up on your feet... - The Gulls are neat. Bye, Frédéric! Have a good day. - Up on your feet! - The Gulls are neat! Let's get to the dinghies. Anyone for the trampoline? Not all of you... We'll all be going out together later. I can swim. I'm bored shitless. I'm bored shitless! Solid stuff... It's a big one but... This one's scratched. These are all second-hand. What are you doing? Get out of there! I'm coming out! Nono, come out now. - He's got his sea legs. - The call of the ocean... It's dangerous! It's not a toy. The boats... Great boats over there. Nono, get down, please. All these are new. Deadly! What? I'm just having a look round. Rent one, stupid. Rent instead of... A boat's like a flute. It's personal. Dad, can I get on the Wind Jet? - No, it's not ours, puppy. - Never mind. - Dad, I've cut my finger off! - Never mind. - Dad, seen the roof? - What can I do? I want to buy a boat for all of us with my savings. We couldn't go skiing and I never have any new clothes... Besides, you know nothing about sailing. I've read books. - You've read books... - Yes, for months and months. It's great that your marriage has lasted. We've got used to each other now. Check the bib and blocks. We're real sailors, you know. - See you. Work hard. - Bye. - This is my wife. - She's a real bomb. 7/8 rigging, low anchorage surface, a neat little number designed by Umberto Force. Get your kicks at a fair price. Nice anchor. Stem, you mean? Okay. Let's sit down. Actually, we only want some information. Sure! I'll need some too. Can I please have your name? Monot. So what do the Monots do? - My husband works in a research lab. - My wife's a language teacher. So you're a lab assistant? The pipette king! You could say that. What's your project? Your desires? Well, I've always loved the sea. I've always dreamed of the open sea, hoisting the sails, heading off for an island, alone... Ever done a sailing course? - Ever set foot on board a sailboat? - No, doctor. Sorry... You like going out in your dinghy... A dinghy... How old is it? We got it on the motorway. Our rubber dinghy. Cut it out! The gentleman doesn't care about that. Let's try to sum up. What kind of boat are you after? - I'm after... - We just want the prices. Of course. That's an important point. I can't hear you. - I can barely hear you. - Sorry. It's about the prices, see... What'll you do with it? Fishing, outings, yomping about... Taking the family out for the day. - Of course! - That's all. Jesus, Sergio! Get rid of that crate! That's enough now! I can't get over the damn thing! This is a sales area! I perceive a slight paradox in your words, Mr Monot. You spoke of sailing away alone but then you added: with the family. There seems to be... A slight paradox, yes. How about you? What are your desires? Do you like the sea? I swim, as long as I can touch the bottom. Of course. What style of swimming? Don't you have a price list? Ouch! What? Just a second... Try using the spinnaker. Wait till the wind drops. There. Fine. Good-bye. I'm doing my best. People just can't get their kicks... Getting your kicks is beautiful. There you go. Good-bye. What a jerk, busting a tribblet. As I was saying, we're pushing the Wind Jet range, from the Wind Jet 2 to the Wind Jet 42, via the 4 and the 24... They're high-performance, streamlined boats that... We won't be sailing races. Are these your ship's boys? Oh, fuck! Sergio, what's this yummock? Why's it here? - Is it old Bouchard's? - It's mine. We have customers. Try tidying up. Are your boats stable? - Very stable, no problem. - That's good. This boat, for instance... How much is it? It's quite simple. The version on offer, without options... isn't this cosier? Here, we're at the heart of the Wind Jet 2, designed with the family in mind. You have a gas ring, a bench seat... There, you have a small cupboard that... Time to abandon ship... Anatole, give it here. You have two possibilities. There's the standard model that comes without... without the mast, sails the upper works or the engine. - This is the basic price? - That's right. - This one? - The sink's included. Don't worry about the sink. Fine but the sink isn't something that I find indispensable. The coffin berth under the cockpit isn't fitted out. Some people find that it's more useful as storage space. Well, those aren't exactly things... I mean, if this is the basic price, I'd say that it's pretty exorbitant. At first sight, anyhow. What do you mean by exorbitant? In relation to our means, say. - I think... - Yes. - You think? - I think. My wife thinks it's relatively impossible. That it's outside our range. Do you prefer a sailboat or a motorboat? A submarine. That's a tough order. Let's try it without sails... A tamarisk. Or a cypress. Is the sailing course good? Working on the vocabulary? What's "preparing for a squall"? Trimming the sail in a strong wind. You know, if ever we buy a boat... I can't manage this on my own. God, your feet are huge. Enormous. No one ever had such big feet in the family. My father had tiny feet. 25,000 divided by... That makes... What do you think of the 4? - What 4? - The Wind Jet 4. Too expensive. I'm in up to here with the 2. With the 4, up to here... With the 24, here... And with 42, glug, glug... What about my patio? The money was for the landscaper. A landscaper? For a patio that size? - What about it? - It's tiny. Dad screwed up when he sent the submarine out to sea. If we don't find it, we'll buy another. Okay. I'm bored shitless... Don't get your hopes up. In she goes! - Defend her. - What the hell can I do? Stop it. That hurts! Bastards! Get the hell out of here! God, she's beautiful... Take the plunge this year. - What can I say to her? - Just talk to her. - She doesn't know me. - You always say that, you chicken. Where are those layabouts? What're they up to? There's a big tide for once. Stupid buggers... Gentlemen... That's a lovely one! Congratulations! Well done. Real pros. Not bad. The guy, s in a foot of water. Go ahead, slip by. My dream... Freedom! Oh, bloody hell! I got fucking blasted. An electric ray. I'm electro... I'm electro... I'm all a-flutter. Should I take you to a doctor? I'm okay. Just an electric shock from some shit ray. Bloody electric ray. - It had to happen. - Look at this. Oh, that's a beauty. That's not a prodder, that's just a fork! The grip has to be made of wood or it's not any use. Yeah... The Wind Jet. I need the Wind Jet. - What's a Wind Jet? - A Wind Jet. A cocktail? Don't tug on the blodget! Forget it. We've slept on it and thought it over. We've come to buy a Wind Jet 2, the keelboat model. - I'm out of Wind Jets. - No more Wind Jet 2s? No Wind Jet 2s, no 4s, no 24s, no 48s. All gone. That's terrible. - They sold like hot cakes. - All of them? That's a big disappointment. I have one left. - You do? - It's second-hand. You told me to be very wary of second-hand boats. Absolutely. You have to be very careful. Well, maybe we could take a little look... at the boat. Okay. Where's the Zigomar? - He's over there. - No, that's the boat's name. Where did you put the Zigomar? The Zigomar? It's high and dry. What the hell for? I'm selling it for a friend. I don't know his price. Oh, fuck... Bloody yummock! "Security is up to you, and to you is your security." It's crap. That's how the Zigomar's maker went bust. Do me a favour: buy a new engine. If I buy second-hand, the engine'll be new. I won't compromise. Stamp your feet, there are snakes around. Here's the Zigomar. What more can I say? Low keelboat... Very low, in fact. It's a unique model. It has its past. It's a love boat. Sir? - Yes? - Careful, it's a bit wobbly. I understand you. I like it too. You grow fond of a boat like this. It can surprise you too with its moods. Go ahead, it's sturdy. Old pots make the best soup. - It's a unique model. - Help me up. - There's no... - No, there isn't. What if I add... two winches? Yes, good idea, two winches... This clown doesn't understand a thing! What's this chain for? There! You've dropped your yummock. Hello! This is the big moment. My heart's pounding. Let go of the rigging screw. Grab the boltrope. Grab what? The ball trope? No! Come over here! - Yes? - Ask the soak for the key. - The soak? - The lock keeper. You kids get on board. - What for? - Let's get masted. Get what? Hello, sir, I... Call me captain! Captain, I... Just kidding. I wish to use the harbour slipway for a short while but it's closed with a chain. No problem but don't take more than fifteen minutes. The thing is, in ten minutes, I pull the flush. The flush? What flush? The lock, of course. I get given a timetable that follows the tides. Come back later. Hurry up and get back to it. You'll hear a bell, then I'll raise the flag. You'll have to clear the passage and tie up your tub. Tie it good and tight because at 12:15... I free all the tide water there. Flotation will cost you 200 francs. What for? For use of the slipway. The sign says so. You see. Pay me later. Hurry now. - Ready to mast? - Yeah. Let's mast! Action stations, sir! In 10 minutes, they open the sluice gates. We have to move fast. Don't worry, we'll manage. We'll unpot your globbit. Get to the yarrows, lads! - What are yarrows? - No idea, pal. Watch your cigarette ash, please. Go on, kid! Get ready with the wooden chocks. - Buccaneer style. - I can't understand a word. He keeps muttering away... Go with the boat! What else am I doing? Go with it. - Buccaneer style! - It's not easy! There! Fuck, that other jerk on the lock! That moron dumped the boat on top of me! - Look out! - What do we do? What's your dad getting so wound up about? I told him buccaneer style. - What do we do, dad? - Pull on the... - What did he say? - No idea. Oh, Jesus, he's pulling the flush. Okay, dad? He's pulled the flush on us. Dad, where are you? You can't have it rubbing the sides. Help me, you dolts. I'm being carried out to sea! Grab the port rope! The port rope! Which rope? Port. It's on the boat! Don't stand there like two lumps. Help me haul the boat. 200 francs to launch the bloody thing... Sod that bastard if he's expecting a tip! What do we do, dad? What did he say? Okay, dad? Mr Monot! The idiot's drowned. No, there he is! Are you okay? Am I okay? Good question! I've got my boat! Here we are. Seen that? Is that ours? Huh, Nono? Seen dad's boat? What do you think? Is dad's boat big? Tiny. With a spanking new engine! Here's the mast. Look. These are called winches. Seen my winches? Yachtsman style... - Classy? - No. I'll need a cap. Like this, see? Not much cop. No, puppy, that's enough. Stop messing about. That's too big. In an emergency, you've had it. At least you'll get spotted. Remember the compass, pen, small anchor and log, please. It's all here. 2,750 francs, please. What? That's a huge amount! You have a monopoly here? Well, this... I'll take one without the fancy bits. I'm not an admiral. Any non-standard flares? Yes but... Give me two, then. Small ones. What can I say? I'm not made of money. Look at this! Just look at this! A Botticelli... An egg and some cheese! 45 francs! Daylight robbery! Know what they call an egg crepe? - A Leonardo da Vinci. - That's funny. I call a spade a spade, okay. No reading at the table! You can have egg, ham or cheese but not all three. I'm speaking to my children! With that boat, I'm bled dry. I'm stony broke. - Stop it, you're scaring him. - We must stick together. We won't go wild every day. Time to tighten our belts. Good evening. Ready to order? You look happy! We've just bought a boat. - What kind of boat? - Just an old tub to yomp about on. What category? I believe that I paid a reasonable price. The length? 36 feet. 35 at the most. It's a small keelboat. A keelboat? Excuse me... - Why shorten it? - They don't need to know. Okay, I'm listening. Have you chosen, Albertine? I'll have a Botticelli, without cheese. A Leonardo da Vinci, then. If you like... A cheese crepe for each of the kids. I want a Michelangelo with spicy sausage. - Think I'm thick? What did I say? - No Michelangelo. And no Sistine, Pergolese, Veronese or other cons! - Put that in your pipe and smoke it! - I wanted to celebrate. What make of boat is it? Who is this guy? "Peace and quiet, far from the mafia". I'll have a Tintoretto. But without the mushrooms, please. Know Tintoretto? - Not personally. - His paintings are magnificent. - No doubt. - And you? A Quattrocento. A Quattrocento. Fine. And a carafe of water. Tap water. I can't believe how rude you were! He was being nice and you upset him. It's none of his business! Like that guy at the lock. No way José! He only asked the name of the boat. Why do you say "No way José"? - He always says that. - No way José, for his tip. He won't get one. I don't give these jackals a penny! When a guy starts asking if you're happy with your new boat, he's getting info for the mafia, see. Want some water? Here. Thanks. So, what are you going to call this great boat? - Mafia-Oléron! - You bet! - A girl's name. We only have sons. - Okay. Peaches. - Peaches-Oléron. - Cut it out! It's a fun name. Fork-sword. He worries me. - José-Oléron! - Be serious. A name reflects your outlook on life. Why not Jojo-the-shark, - like my submarine. - Jojo-the-shark... We can't call it that. It's a good name! Okay, that's enough! It's called Zigomar for now. Carry on winding me up and it'll stay Zigomar. Look the Zigomar's coming back. Come on, Benoît! Benoît, it's cold! Liberté... - Liberté-Oléron. - What are you talking about? - Liberté-Oléron. - You what? - The boat. - Oh, the boat... - Liberté. - It's nice. I like it a lot. Like it, Nono? Liberté-Oléron? You do? Nono likes it. It's perfect for a boat on the sea. Look at these devils! I need to see my brother's babysitter for a second. Sure. Go on in. When you push the helm away, the prow turns into the wind. It sails into the wind. This is known as luffing. Luffing. Know what luffing means? Monday 17. We all agree. The name will be Liberté-Oléron. We must learn about the sea, handle the sails, train my boys, make Benoît an efficient, sober, brave and responsible mate, reassure Albertine, now in charge of supplies, and keep her away from any manoeuvres. Great adventures lie ahead. Perhaps one day we could sail over to the island. That would be magnificent. We danced after the restaurant. It's wonderful to dance and sing too. Never forget that. Thank you, Liberté-Oléron, I kiss your stern. If I put in... Yes, I'll put in a cypress. Here. No, over here. I'll put the rosemary here. Come in. It's this way. Here we are. It's a lovely spot. Yes, I like the fact that it's enclosed. It's like a Moroccan village square. A rosemary bush over there. Yes, absolutely. Absolutely... Let's check the amplitude now! Careful! Not there yet... Please, dad, no, please. No. Let's try digging elsewhere. If the sea's rough, we'll hit that clown there. Dig there! - Oh, shit... - Go on! - You're pissing me off. - You wanted a boat! So dig! Veils and sails You can keep it. I've read it. I'd glad we've got acquainted. I was always seeing you around. Don't you miss him, now he's found the sea? No, Jacques loves it. He has a real passion for the sea. He's a new man. He's happy. The kids are happy... - You're a happy sailor's wife, then? - Yes. Pre-departure checklist! Lifejackets? Freshwater jerrycan? - Fuel jerrycan? - Full. Signal rockets? Wind direction? Fog horn? Don't sound it. Only in an emergency. God preserve us. Cast off! Hey, we're not deaf! Out to the open sea! The dinghy can't keep up. Say hello to them! Sailors at sea form one big brotherhood. Looks like they used the sailor's code to wipe their bums. The day they capsize, no way José! Do we hoist the sail? No, we're here to go fishing today. Mum asked to get some fish. She told you to go shopping! Don't move, bunny... Fish coming... it needs total silence. The fish is coming, you know. They're crafty. They hear everything. Some guys... Asshole! Don't move, puppy. - I can't move any less. - Look! Funny, isn't it? I bet this isn't a big one. See, it's not a very big one. A gurnard, maybe. Or a bream... A small bream... Or a good bream. I've hooked him! Bloody hell! Don't move. Move out of the way, puppy. Bloody hell! The swine. This is tough! This is tough! Oh, fuck! Bloody hell! Seen this, Anatole? Look. Look at this! Blimey... It's minute... You think it's an adult? Look at this thing. It's a midget. I've rarely seen a smaller one. Coming all this way for this crap! This silence... It's really... You're in the sea that picks you up in its liquid hand. Just the lapping of the waves at the surface... You let yourself be rocked by the sea... You forget your worries, the daily grind... the jackals, the rascals, the guys who make life hell. One moment like this makes the whole thing worth it. And, believe me, I haven't paid off my debts yet. But I couldn't care less. I have my reward. What do you think? I don't think anything. You don't think anything. You nelly. You're in this magnificent setting, with the sea around you and you don't care. Make the most of it. You won't have many moments like this. You'll see later how good it'll be to look back on your memories. You'll say, "I remember, that day I went sailing with dad. I was a child then." You'll see, when you inherit the boat, when I'm dead. I may not make old bones. What are you talking about? Read us something from Cyrano de Bergerac, Anatole. Why don't you come over here with us? Is puberty tough? Let's not overdo it. I'll try it again. See that? It almost started. I'll try again straight off. - It's smoking! - That's normal. I'll try it without the choke. With the starter, the engine... works extra hard and floods! No more choke. What's that noise? It didn't do that before. - You've cut the fuel off. - Give me a break! It's no use! I'm tugging at it like crazy... The guy flogs me a new 9.9 with the guarantee and all. That Chevreteau... What a jerk. It should start up at my touch. What a jerk. The sidekick with the hair... "Buy a new engine off me." Sure! What's that noise? The anchor banging on the hull. Don't touch the anchor! I've got idiots for sons. Don't let go! Just don't let go! - Haul the anchor up. - What? - Don't let go! - No... What? I have to do it all. What use are those books of yours? You can't raise an anchor? You can't do that? Here's the anchor now. It's coming up. Here's the anchor, see. Now stow it away. - What happened? - It was out of the water. Give me your mobile. I'll show you... Chevreteau, that crook, I'll give him an earful! A new Yamaha engine... No signal... Sod it. Fuck! He wants to shipwreck me. Bloody Chevreteau... It's simple enough, you know. He wants to strand me. Mr Chevreteau? I'm on the former Zigomar. What the hell's that? The former Zigomar. I bought a new Yamaha engine and I'm totally stranded out here! I keep tugging on the... what's it called... on that string thingummy... I'll put you through to the technical department. Vivaldi! He's playing me bloody Vivaldi! He'll use my calling time! Okay, we'll scull back. We'll what? Scull? You'll soon see. Sculling time... isn't that them there? He's got a problem. Nono, come and see. I think that's your dad. He's making a lot of noise. See that little boat? They wouldn't lift a finger! They can see I'm in trouble, that I'm a useless sculler. The bastards! - Don't complain. - Put it there. Put it down gently. It's pretty heavy... if you get my meaning. What now? What happens next? We'll take a look at it. - Go ahead. - I'm not much cop with engines. You what? It's a brand-new engine! - I'm not deaf. - I've only used it once. I take it out and... What did you do? When I started it back up, I pulled on the... You used the pump first? The pump, yes. The bulb on the fuel line. You pumped it. Yes, I did that. I pulled the... Excuse me. You pulled the... Yes, I pulled the... Maybe it's the bloots. - The bloots? - Yes. You have two bloot heads here, see. Two bloot heads that could slip on the catcher. Look, if I'm out at sea, what do I do with these bloot things? You'd need to take it all apart. They're only tiny but they can mean trouble. He's leaving. Aren't you going to take a look? Calm down. Let's have some quiet... No, the bloots are dead. They're dead? Both of them? Yeah, it's too late. Too late? - Change the bloots right now! - I can't do anything. You've got the wodgers here riveted to the croddit. It all gets mangled up, see. What more can I say? Change the bloots! - What's up, dad? - This is getting really... Jesus in the manger! - Mr Chevreteau! - Hello, Mr Monot. - Kind of you to pop in. - I wish I didn't have to. - Why? What's wrong? - My two bloots are dead. Both of them? - Both bloots? - Yes. Let's talk it over. Careful... Up on your feet! The Gulls are neat! Tuesday 18! The boat's adopting me. I'm getting used to it. Make more progress before taking Albertine out. Endless fine-tuning. First successful outing on the open sea. No, opposite the white house. Fishing, one caught. Engine trouble. It's annoying to feel you can't trust your engine. Before going to the island, teach boys bowlines. Very delicate task. Enough to put you off boating. Sense a certain apathy in the boys, a lack of energy and will that a boat could genuinely sharpen up. Hey, Anatole, how about reading a speech? Right now? Make your father happy. The one you read to mum. Go on, you want to be an actor. "No thank you. No thank you. But sing, dream, laugh, move on, be alone, have a choice, a watchful eye and powerful voice." You don't have to bug your eyes! Go on... "Be content with flowers, fruit and leaves even from your own garden. Refuse to be the clinging ivy nor even the oak or lime. I may not get far, but I'll get there alone." What? No one wants any? - By the way, the gardener's an expert. - Delicious. - An expert in what? - Let me finish. An expert on boats! He has a big one, I think. He's been sailing for 20 years. He could help us. I told him you'd bought a boat. Why did you tell him? Who is he? Hold on, let me finish. He's a nice guy. He's friendly... And he's invited us to go on his boat. That's kind. Hold on, you don't buy a boat to go and swank about on another guy's! He's not my gardener, okay. Landscape designer! You can be so narrow-minded! Fine, but the garden's your headache. I'm not coughing up a penny for it. She wants a miniature Versailles with all the views. 18-inch views! You're away with the fairies. We'll put down Astroturf with a couple of cactuses and call it a day! If you put down turf on a tiny patio it'll look like a doormat. Shut up! You said we needed some greenery! This place is like a building site. The boat's all that matters now! We wouldn't mind some pocket money. We can't afford anything. Anyhow, he's coming tomorrow. I don't care. I'll pay him and make this place pretty. Just a second. Bring the cheese back, nothing's left. You eat so slowly. - Aren't you asleep yet? - No. "Up on your feet..." "The Gulls are neat." Give it a rest. - How's the club going? - Okay. What does "to gybe" mean? Put about in a rear wind. Can't I come on the boat instead? Of course. The Liberté-Oléron needs ship's apprentices like you. Good night, bunny. Bunnies are bad luck on a boat. They are? I knew that but I've already said it on board. Oh, bloody hell. - What do you say, then? - A big-eared animal. Good night, my big-eared animal. What are you doing? No thanks. You don't want a Mars bar? I'll put it away, then. I can't find my submarine. Up on your feet! I'm checking... And now... I pay off. No, stupid, take it easy. Not too much. Now I'm luffing again. I'm luffing her a bit... - I'm luffing... - What are you up to, dad? Do you mind? I'm luffing. Around my winch. Friday 21: Departure 7:40. Jib hoisted 11:30. What the hell's this? "Up Paris St Germain!" You think they even told me? Passed the same guy whistling in his canoe. The nutter! Attempt at gybing. Two luffs around, one successful. I have to work on the luffing. It's abstract. Roof cleaned by older boys. These guys don't warn you. Up the Socialists! Albertine didn't come. Take this. It's sticky. 'Morning! - I was on byway over. - You were? Getting on? There? Well, why not? Just a second. In you get. There! Careful. It's a bumpy ride. It's a bumpy ride? Saturday 22: Without Albertine. Heading 160°... or so. Came straight back. Clamped clam cleat. Slapped Anatole, very annoying today. He thinks I'm a jerk. Bowlines impossible to do. Bowlines equal bollocks. I used a tie knot. Held very well. Sunday 23: Was wrong yesterday. Check bowlines again and buy another anchor. Stow away peach brandy for medicinal purposes. Oil two winches well. Beware of landscaper. Albertine stayed behind because of mist. Mist made island invisible. There you are. My husband Jacques... Mr Gaboriau who's doing the garden. I hear you've bought the old Zigomar. Guess what, Jacques... He's done the garden plan. Let's take a look at it right away on the table. Come along. Call me Frankie. Frankie... That's a nice name. Opposite the view of the rosemary, a Finnish cypress to raise the sight lines. Why Finnish? Because it's slender and sea green. It's quite unusual too, right? Yes, quite unusual. But I know a place where I can get one. Really? - Get what? - The cypress. Let me remind you that this view is just six feet long. That's pretty short. I just wanted to point that out. What have you called your boat? The Lotus. Why? The lotus is a flower that grows in mud. You know... I sincerely believe that beauty can come from filth or putrefaction... Okay, let's go. I like you both. So do we. Is this teak? Try to relax, Jacques! - Are you cold, Albertine? - A little. There's whiskey in the cabin. No thanks. I'll never make it to the cabin. Get the bottle and a couple of glasses. Jacques? A whiskey? This moment is the only alcohol I need. I'm enjoying the view. It's sheer magic! Want to go to the island? No. Some other time. I think he'd rather go under his own steam. Here, take this. Jacques, take the helm. We'll use the booster. Loosen up! The power... Anatole, watch your father... I'll keep the same heading. What the hell's he up to? Okay? Take your undies off! - Not very tanned, are you? - No. The sun'll do your skin good. Maybe but... It's a whole outlook on life, see. Want your jacket off? You're doing pretty well. Want to take the helm? - Take the helm a bit. - Okay... Maybe not. I can't use the helm. Of course you can, you'll see. - I keep going straight ahead? - It's sublime out there! Give me your hand, Anatole. - I can't steer, Jacques! - You can. Sorry, Frankie. Jacques! Jacques is over there. Can you feel it? Feels good, huh? Let the feeling grow. Let it grow. There, that's good. Hold on. Hey, Jacques! "I haunted a woman's face Haunted by a wave Cast by the swell on a shore A body lost among her shells" "I haunted a woman's face Killing me without beacons Who will stay in my blood that sails To the gates of madness" Some days, I'm glad I'm not a mussel. - Some days you wish you were? - Yes. Some days, as a teenager. Finished tuning that guitar? It's grating on my nerves. I was going to drink my whiskey when suddenly we listed... I lost it all, without drinking a drop! Gosh, it was funny! - I got my bronze gull! It's for you. - Thanks. You like it? It's really amazing, the speed it goes at. It's pretty intoxicating. When you steer, you can feel the boat pushing... I'll get a corkscrew. What corkscrew? - Thanks for looking after Nono. - Thank my eldest. Oh, okay. - Does she live here? - Yes, she does. Her daughter looked after Nono. You could have said. What's wrong? You've got a zit on your nose. - Want me to pop it? - Cut it out! Are we roasting the mussels? - What a surprise! - Chevreteau, at last. Nice set-up you've got here. This is Cynthia. - A friend... - Good evening. You know "Three Little Kittens"? Is that it? Three little kittens, three little kittens, Tens, tens... Tens and twelves, tens and twelves, Elves, elves... Wonderful, wonderful, full, full... Full of beans, full of beans, beans, beans... Beanstalk, beanstalk, talk, talk... Talk show, talk show, show, show... Silly buggers! Give it a rest! In she goes! What's up with Frankie? - You go. - What can I do? Cut it out! You're crazy! It was a game! You're off your head! Oh, they're just youngsters. Caroline... - Are you okay? - I'm sick of it. Come over by the fire. Feeling better? My eldest, Caroline. Good evening. Poor thing. Frankie's so gentle... Do you know him well? He's a childhood friend. My first boyfriend, actually. - He's sleeping on his boat? - Yes. He will until he finds a woman. He's not married? No, he's all alone. - Don't you have a... - You've got a nerve! I don't mind. No, I don't have a... The fathers have all gone. The fathers? Yes, the fathers. Four daughters, four fathers. One each... Is Frankie your father? No. He looked after her a lot. You've sailed together? Not for a long time now. - Want to come to the island? - No. I'm not too keen. - How about you, Caroline? - Why not... Not so rough, please! Take it easy, lad! Make the most of it. Be tender. It's so peaceful! It's perfect weather to go out. To the island. Tomorrow. We're going out to the island. Maybe we'll never return... What am I talking about? Recognise me? It's your old man. I was reading my book and I was wondering if you'd understand this... if I'm on port tack and a guy arrives on starboard tack, broad reaching, - what do I do? - I've got no idea. You know, I'm patient enough to learn. I've got some things down pat but, even so, I feel I'm not quite up to scratch. I'm aware of my limits. Tomorrow's important because mum's coming. She has to enjoy every minute. I want us to be there for her, always calm and competent. I trust you, son. That means get back here fast. We leave early. Everyone up at 6!50. I'm waiting for you. Okay, Caroline? Ready to luff? I luff, pump up the fuel line and here we go! I'm nice and hard... - I'm checking... - It's hideous! Here we go! Luff. - Luffing about! - No, I don't want to! You want to luff about? Cyrano, save us! You wanna touch? I'll smash your winches! The jackals... The bastards... Start! Start, damn you! - Dad, you've overslept. - You said up at 7. Come on, get up! - Come on, kids... - We're off to the island. Bugger, I went back to sleep. They're already dressed. I don't believe it. Give mum a kiss. Choppy sea with a westerly swell in Forties, Cromarty, Forth, Tyne, Dogger, Fisher... Fantastic weather... A little heat haze, perfect... With just enough breeze. You know, we'll have a great time. "I may not get far but I'll get there alone." We leave in 10. Don't move. This has to stay dry. No need to bring so much. Don't weigh yourself down. Carry the jerrycan, if you want. - It's heavy! - Carry your bag, then. - Yes. - I'm just saying... - Okay, let's go! - Off we go! I hope the weather holds... Best foot forward. It's the big day. We're off to the island without turning back. A full crew. Four days' supplies. Caroline, from the white house, has joined us. A future daughter-in-law or a potential mutineer... - Sorry we're late. - That's okay. - We use first names at sea. - Okay, Mr Monot. Why are you giving me this? You're embarrassed? Come on, let's go. We need everyone to spread out over the whole binnacle. We're in the hands of the elements. Cut it out. Let's go, it's a lovely day. Oh, Lord, I think my dress... You've torn it. Never mind. Don't step on the dinghy. - Jacques, my dress... - There. Good. Move over to starboard. Go on. Come and have some Dramamine. You've already dosed them up with pills and patches... if you feel sick, I have some patches left. - Anatole, are you ready? - No. We'll be using the engine all the way across! I want to do a bit of sailing. It's already 8!35! Ready to hoist! "I may not get far but I'll get there alone." - Ready to hoist? - We told you. Okay, unfurl the sails! That's good, boys. Carry on like that. I'm stopping the engine. There you go. Look... Trim that halyard! Trim is for big sails. You say "sway up". Sway up? I'll say what I like. This is my boat, okay. He's lecturing to me... He's taking the wind out of my sails... - Hi! - Hi, Guy! One of mum's friends... I'm luffing... I've luffed... Nothing's happening at all. I can't luff anymore. It didn't want to... - Or I luff again? - No! I don't get it, I'm luffing... See, I'm luffing all I can. It's not that important. - Beautiful, isn't she? - Yes. - You should tell her. - You're nuts! Why? - Want me to pop that zit? - Cut it out! - It's huge! - Get off my back! It's not nice on your nose. It makes your nose look incredibly huge too. Frédéric, get down from there. I hold your beard, you hold mine The first one to laugh Gets a slap - Are you crazy? - Sorry... I should hope you are sorry! - Give me one back. - That's not how you play. - It is. - No, I laughed first. - Please. - Those aren't the rules! I beg you... Not on your life! She's slapping my son! I'm not pleased with this compass. - What are you doing? - Looking for my submarine. - You are? - Puppy dog... Let's look for it. Don't lean out too far. It might pass by. Gaboriau reminded me of Jeoffroy. - In the "Angélique" movies. - Right. With his scar. He had one just here, Jeoffroy did. Fort Boyard! They imprisoned - Louise Michel in that fort. - They did? What's that I see? He's coming from the port tack. I'm in the eye of the wind. The wind means I'm close-hauled... Jacques, he's a bit... - Hold on! - I have priority. I'll start the engine but I have priority. - It's a big boat... - I'm not denying that. He's understood anyhow and he's imperceptibly changing course. He's imperceptibly heading for us! He's coming up on the port tack... Change tack! Oh, my God! No respect! Asshole! I had priority and he knew it. That boat's bigger, it has priority. It's logical. - You're crazy. - That's it, honeybunch... Wind has priority over horsepower. - I had dual priority. - Land ahoy! Where've they put the harbour? Think we can just turn up? Maybe we need to give a signal. Nono, put that down! Put it down right now! In the box! That's a flare. Keep the rope taut... Okay, the snake... slithers down... into the well. - Got it? - Comes back out, climbs the tree... meets a little monkey and has a long, long chat... Ready when you are! That big knot should do it. We're hungry! That's enough now. How about lunch here? To keep an eye on the boat. We can find a nicer place. - Let's see the island. - Won't take long. - You said it was beautiful. - Beautiful... We have to be back by 3!50 for the tide. Synchronise your watches. - Let's get going. - If we lose each other... Let's go, double-quick. - That's a drawbridge. - An old one? - Look at the roof. - Is it fortified? You bet, it was a very... With six berths, we could have slept here... Six berths is a 50-footer. At least 400,000 francs. There should be a beach. Actually, I think... we should take that path or we'll be among the houses. I reckon we should go that way because... We'll ask one of the natives. The promised land at last. We're walking your paths. A thought for Napoleon who once walked here too. By the way, the natives aren't that welcoming. They're very discreet in fact. Twice round the island to discover its riches, its flora, etc. Eyes left! Come on, Frédéric. Free time for everyone. Including me. Come on, Nono, chin up. - No sign of the sea. - Stamp your feet for snakes. Anatole! Cyrano! Look, Frankie's here! Don't move... Careful... There. Women love popping zits, you know. You're beautiful but you know that. It's nice to be told. I have no sense of humour. - I'm glad you don't try to be funny. - You do have a sense of humour. You'd like me to kiss you? It would be so easy. So pathetic. - Grotesque, even. - Don't bother. - Seen that over there? - What? It looks like a kangaroo. What the hell is this place? A kangaroo... This is a nice drop of wine. Yes, it's fruity. It has body but you can also sense... life flowing into your veins. What if we get fat or stupid? We are the way we are. Nothing fabulous but individuals. Pleased with yourself, honey? I'm not going to make old bones. Why do you say that? Because, once you've reached a certain goal, you feel you've had your fill. I've got the sky, I've got you... I've got your bum. Are you making the most of it? Want to be buried or cremated? I've thought about it. Cremated, for sure. - Can I ask why? - I think it's better. You vanish completely. You don't leave a mound of flesh rotting away in a box. I had a cat called Choupinette. We buried her at my gran's. Now I know where she is. I talk and listen to my father anytime. Your father's... You talk to him? Everywhere. In the house in summer, when I smell his favourite drink or hear the song that he'd sing when changing my sister's nappy. I don't need to go to a cemetery, see. I like to go to gran's to see Choupinette. If I catch you, I'll kill you! If I catch you, I'll kill you. You're not dead. "You take everything... the laurel and the rose too! Go on, take them. But, in spite of you, one thing goes with me now... And tonight, when I at last God behold... my salute will sweep his blue threshold... with something... spotless, a diamond in the ash, which I take in spite of you and that's..." What? - "My panache." - What's a panache? Oh, shit... - The tide won't wait! - Wait, there's an insect! Nono, hurry up! Come on, Nono! Take this. - What's wrong, Jacques? - Look, it's dangling! - What do we do? - It's dangling! - What do we do? - We're going to climb down. I'm not using the ladder! - You are. - No, I get vertigo looking at it! Stop laughing like an idiot. Anatole, take the dinghy. Go to the beach to fetch mum and the kids. We'll wait for high tide. First things first. Stay calm. Anatole, get on board to help your mother. Hand him the oars. Don't put both feet on the same side! I told you! What are you doing? Calm down. Mum, catch! - Why ditch the flask? - I'm drowning! You aren't. You can touch the bottom. Stand up. God, the silly cow... Why throw the cooler at her? Hand me the boat hook. No, that long thing there. Nono's shrimp net then! God, the silly cow... I'm drowning! The silly cow... I'm drowning! You're okay now! That's it. Help her! Shut up, Nono! Shut up. We've got mum. I told you: never put both feet on the same side. I forgot. You don't listen, you mean. And you ended up in a hole too. I didn't mean to. Get some peach brandy. I'm cold. We could have done without this. Get this down you, in one. It'll pick you up. - It's horrible. - What? It's hair tonic! This is mine. Idiot! You gave her this? You take the biscuit. Try to cough. Spit it out. You great lummox. - It's sticky inside. - What? - It's sticky inside. - Inside? We didn't find my submarine. Not now, bunny. We have other problems. That's bad luck, you say "big-eared animal". It's too late, I've said it now. - Forget the bunny. - Forget me? No, not you, bunny. Shit! The same clown... Heel! - No, counterheel. - I said that. Ready to counterheel. Counterheel! Not all of you at once! Heel! Counterheel! Excuse me, you're blocking my heading. Where's the white house? Move out of the way. Changing tack. Ready to change tack. We just did that. Why do it again now? In a case of dire need... although not quite yet... - What do you mean? - A squall may be coming. Don't talk rubbish. We're heading north! - Ready to change tack? - You just did. That's what changing tack is about. - I don't like it. - Changing tack! Work to windward! - Heel! - I liked it when you used the engine. I'm sailing, I enjoy sailing. It's my reward. The weather's perfect. The call of the sea Is what torments us The wind blows... Belt up! Cut it out! Belt up! - What? - He said belt up! - You're going to gybe! - We're what? Don't stand up. Heel! Let that be a warning to you. Stop hauling like crazy. Think! Use your heads! They're hauling away... That's fragile! That's a sheet. Where's your squall? I'll give you a squall. I said, only in dire need. Ready to change tack, you jerks? My hand's killing me! - Let me see. - It's just a blister, puppy. Would they fucking help? I can't do it. I can't keep my heading! Morons! Try lowering the centreboard. Shut it! - How low is it already? - Three or four notches. Three or four? Be precise. Come on, be precise! Okay, get ready to lower the... Lower it two notches. What's up, big-eared bunny? What are you talking about? He's lowering it fifty notches! I said three or four! - What? - The centreboard's gone. What? If you're pulling my leg, I'll smash your face in. Take the helm. - We've lost the... - We can't have! We've lost the... Emergency! From now on, you do exactly what I say. There's a squall coming. Put on your bullet... your life jackets! Caroline doesn't have one. She can use Nono's arm floats. I never asked her to come. No centreboard... What a disaster. Get in the cabin with the kids. Out of my sight! Come on, Nono. Get in the cabin, Frédéric! Take the helm for a second. Do what I'm telling you to do! Calm down, dad. Your lifejacket. I'll show you. Look where the bloody things are. Who the hell asked you? What the hell did you gybe for? Stupid git! Thin as a rake! Idler! You're mad. That's enough. You're not ordering me around. You can't handle this tub. Take us back now. I have to be back by six. Lower this crap and let's go. How dare you? I'm in charge here, after God. If her ladyship has a date and we're in a storm, out at sea and I'm trying to control things, so I shit on you all! There. Benoît, put your floozy in the cabin now! - Come on. - I won't let some bitch rule my boat. My own boat! I'll handle it all. I'll finish up. They can screw their luffing. I don't give a shit. The winches... Bloody useless winches... Get the lines done. This boat is a piece of shit. It should have stayed the Zigomar. I've paid 40 grand and got into debt for two years for a Zigomar. Fuck. With a family of four morons to feed! Never have kids at 20. Never marry at 20. Get back in the cabin, you! Sod that! I hate this boat. It's a piece of shit. What? I hate the boat, I hate sailing, I'm bored shitless! That's your opinion... He's going to come down with a cold. He's coughing... Thanks a fucking bundle! This is going to be fun... I can't go on. The bloots... 800 francs for two bloots. What are bloots? Bloots, you stupid cow! The thingies... I've had enough too. Why did you buy this piece of shit? Come here, you. Let me have a shit on your head! One son's a fairy and the other wanks off all day! You cannot speak that way! The children are frightened and they are sick! I don't give a shit, bitch. Shut it! You're going to kill us. - I'm going to die. - Shut it! Sweetheart... What the hell... Why didn't you fucking say there was a handle in here? No, you're my love, my one true love... - Cut it out! - Don't leave me! What have I done? Stay here, Nono, please! Come here, Nono, lad. What do I do now? Come back. Don't leave me alone! What do I do? That cunt's firing at us! People'll think it's a party. I didn't know what they were like. I didn't try them in the shop, stupid. I don't know what I'm doing! Forgive me. You're a wonderful family. Let's hold each other. You're beautiful. Yes, sweetheart, my love, you're bleeding. Frédéric, son... come over here near me. Don't worry. We're going to die. Three little kittens, little kittens, tens, tens... Tens and twelves, tens and twelves, elves, elves... Elves and leprechauns, corns, corns... Look, there's a boat. It's Gaboriau. Having a party, are you? We had a lovely trip out there. There was a nice little breeze, the water was turquoise, sapphire blue... It's surprising to see so many colours in the water. And all the ferryboats sailing back and forth. It's incredible. Then we saw Fort Boyard. That's an amazing sight, those stones full of history. Passing time and all that... Good job Frankie turned up. Yes. There again, we were never really in any danger. Caroline told me you dived in, Frédéric. My little Frédéric's like that. I didn't tell you... Frankie's planted my cypress for me. I'm really pleased with it. What's that bruise there? That's nothing. Just the boom. When you go sailing, you have to know what's what because it's always moving. I got hit by the boom. I was a bit... Still we had a laugh after. I'll have this one here. What about your date? I didn't have a date. Excuse us for everything. I've packed, I'm going to stay with a pal in Brittany. Want to come with me? No, it's sweet to ask but look, Benoît, you're too much of a kid. For me, I mean. Understand? Yes, I understand. - Will you be here next year? - Yes, all summer. I like it here. How about you? If you want, you could have a room here. - I could? - Sure. There. Frédéric dived in. Of his own free will. The Gulls' Club was over for him. Boat sold at a fair price. Couldn't find buyer for engine. End of this modest and far too short log. An insignificant story. When she was little, they had made big holes in her ears, for her earrings, so they told her. She grew up, got married, raised her children but never ever wore earrings. One day, her eldest son told her, "I have to go now, mother, but one day I'll bring you some solid silver earrings, so long they'll touch your shoulders." She gave a faraway smile. "Seeing you come back to me will suffice, my son." Subtitles: Ian Burley Subtitling: TVS - TITRA FILM Paris
