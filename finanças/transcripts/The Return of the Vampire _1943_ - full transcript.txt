- This is the case of Armand Tesla, vampire, as compiled from the personal notes of Professor Walter Saunders, Kings College, Oxford. The following events took place in the outskirts of London towards the close of the year, 1918. They began on the night of October the 15th. A particularly gloomy, foggy night, that was well suited for a visitation by the supernatural. Master. It's night again. Beautiful, dark, silent night with the fog creeping in. Time for you to awaken, Master. Time for you to go out. Andreas, you will tell me what has transpired during the hours of light. She is still alive, Master. I watched her through the window at Dr. Ainsley's sanatorium. She just lies there on a cot stares upward at nothing at all. And a great professor, an old teacher of Dr. Ainsley. has come from Oxford to find out what is wrong with her. Just as if any of them could tell what happened. Prowlers? Possibly, we have them sometimes. Oh. Look at this, Professor Saunders. Well? There's nothing wrong with this blood condition. Certainly no indication of anemia. Yet, the woman was practically bloodless when she was found. Nothing to indicate hemorrhage, wounds? Not a sign of a thing. She was evidently suffering from shock. We haven't been able to get a thing out of her. Hm. Baffling, very. That's why I sent for you, Professor. - Master John, you simply must not jump about like this. Oh, Lady Ainsley, I'm so glad Grandpapa brought me with him. We've been playing war, sir. Nicki was a German, and I killed her. - I hope he didn't kill you very much, darling. - Don't you think it's time you were in bed, young man, or don't soldiers sleep? Of course they do. - May I play one piece on the piano before we go to bed? - Please? - Very well, then, just one. Oh, hooray, come, Nicki. We can be riding in a tank until we get there. - I'm sorry to have interrupted you, milady. That's quite all right. We'll be up later to tuck them in. Shall we see the patient now? - Yes. Put the light on the patient's face, please. Miss Norcutt, can you hear me? Miss Norcutt? That light, my eyes. No, don't close your eyes. Just keep looking at me as long as you can. Yes, like that. Observe the eyes. The dilation, almost hypnosis. You're hurting me. Who's hurting you? Answer, am I hurting you? Miss Norcutt, answer. My dream. What dream? Your eyes looked like burning coals. Don't come any nearer. Don't touch me. No, no, I didn't tell them. No. No, I didn't tell them. I didn't tell them. Dr. Ainsley! What did she mean about the dream? I don't know yet. I'm afraid it goes deeper than medicine. Deeper even than science. From the beginning of time man has been troubled. by the uncertainty of death and by the rare and horrible manifestations which occur at intervals in which the dead are known to return from their graves. - Professor, you haven't been to bed. No. You've discovered something. I want you to come with me. Lacerations about the size of pinpricks on the throat. What? Look. Needle pricks, surely. No, I paid no attention to those marks on her throat last night because they seemed unimportant. This morning I know better. What then do they indicate? - Incisions made by the teeth of a vampire. A vampire, a bat, an animal? - No, Jane, not a bat, a vampire, a monster. A fantastic something that draws blood from the human body through the jugular veins of its victim. This thirst for blood is akin to our craving for food. Without human blood, they perish. Listen to these notes that I have made from the writings of a Romanian scientist, an authority on vampirism. Armand Tesla, who lived 200 years ago. This, for instance. Once attacked, the victim of a vampire is completely dominated by this creature. - But surely vampires exist only in the imagination. - Did imagination make those marks on her throat? But- - Was it reality or fantasy that caused the dogs to bark last night as though wolves were about? But this is ridiculous. I can't believe- - Milady. - What is it, Elsa? - It's Nicki. I can't wake her. - Nicki. Transfusion, our only chance. Then, you're really convinced that Nicki was attacked by a vampire. - There's not the slightest room for doubt. If we allow another night to pass, it will try to reach her again. And the next time may prove fatal. How ghastly. - I tell you, not a soul will ever believe us, but we know this monster exists. A menace, deadly, horrible. We must destroy it. - But how? - According to this Dr. Armand Tesla a vampire can only be destroyed by driving a spike through its heart while it sleeps in its coffin. Or by forcing it out into the bright sunlight which will cause it to shrivel and perish. - We can't see this thing through by ourselves. Yes, we can. A vampire must rest during the day in the soil in which it was buried. But the coffin might be hidden anywhere. Could it? How many graveyards are there in this vicinity? Well, there's the church fields and the burial ground at Old Priory, but that's been abandoned for years. - Then, we must try them both and pray for guidance. Are you coming with me? Yes. Look here. Professor. - There's nothing to fear as long as we have the sunlight. We haven't much time. Look, Jane. If this is it, it's likely to be here. Yes. Why, it's a man and he's alive. - Yes, alive, with the blood of his victim. Now are you convinced, Jane? But how can we be certain? According to Dr. Tesla, a vampire's face casts no reflection in a mirror. Shall we try? Oh, Professor. You killed him. Killed the master. Why, what is it? Some loathsome creature of the vampire. Tesla said that they exist. We must help him. Yes. This is absolutely the most fantastic thing I've ever read. - Fantastic, Sir Frederick, or unbelievable? - Oh, I'm not gonna haggle phrases with you, Lady Jane. This manuscript was discovered amongst the effects of Professor Saunders who died recently in a plane crash. Its very serious implications can't be ignored. My dear lady, you simply can't go around the country driving things through people's hearts. I quite understand, Sir Frederick. - This person that you and Professor Saunders disposed of, who was he? Armand Tesla, the depraved Romanian scientist who died in 1744 shortly after he published his work on vampirism. Tesla's morbid thirst for knowledge turned upon him and after his death, he himself became a vampire. - Oh, rubbish, there's no such thing as a vampire. You're wrong, Sir Frederick. And Tesla's man Friday, this Andreas, what happened to him? - For years, Tesla had him under complete hypnotic control. But with Tesla's destruction, Andreas was released from this nightmare. And after years of patient care and treatment, he was restored to normal. Today, he's perfectly well and invaluable to me in my work. My dear Lady Jane. I have the greatest respect and admiration for you like everyone else in England, but you must remember that I'm chief commissioner for Scotland Yard. And as such, there's only one thing I can do. That grave must be opened. And if we discover the remains of a man with a spike through his heart, well, then I'm very much afraid that you will be liable to prosecution for murder. Mother, I thought you were going to stop by the concert hall after you left Sir Frederick's office. No, I came straight home. Oh, Nicki dear. - Hello. - How did the rehearsal go? - Oh, just so so. That's informative. They've really done him awfully proud. - Honorably discharged from the Royal Air Force because of wounds received in a sweep over the channel. Mr. Ainsley returns to music lovers of this city. It is rather thrilling. - Nicki made a perfect spectacle of herself. She brought at least a dozen of them home with her. I did not, it was two dozen. I ask you, what can I do with him? That's for you to find out. After you're married I'll wash my hands of him entirely. - You know you can't get rid of me that easily. - I'd like to talk to you for a few moments. Nicki won't mind, will you, dear? I don't mind a bit. - The wedding announcements are up in your room. Thank you. Come on. So, that's what Sir Frederick wanted. Yes. When is he going to open the grave? He'll call me. And if they find a body? - I shall be able to prove that Tesla was a vampire. The body will not be decomposed. - Are you worried? - For myself, no. For Nicki, yes. I've always hoped that she would never know about this whole ghastly business. If it's to come out into the open- What is it, Andreas? - Here is the blood report you asked for, milady. - Andreas, did you hear what we were talking about? No, sir. - Here come the Jerries. - You better call Nicki. I shall want her if there are any casualties. Blimey, look at this place. It's getting so it ain't even safe to be dead. Right. So help me. I ain't going to do nothing with him. - The king expects every man to do his duty. - Well why did they have to shove this blinkin' job onto me? Well, I don't know why. Look. - Don't do that. - There's a blasted spike stickin' out of his chest. You know it ain't right for a man to be buried decent and proper like and then go and get hit by a bloomin' bomb splint. That spike's gotta come out before we bury him again. Yes. Horace, pull it out yourself. Chickenhearted is what you are. What's that? Come on, Horace. Let's bury him and get it over with. Yes, but which is his grave? How do I know which is his grave? He oughta consider himself lucky to have a grave. - Yes. - Come on. Let's shove him in the blinkin' hole. Yes? Oh, that's splendid news, indeed. Quite, I'll proceed exactly as with the others. Goodbye. Andreas, have you ever heard of Dr. Hugo Bruckner? Bruckner? Oh, yes, the famous scientist from Heidelberg. He's a prisoner in some German concentration camp. He was a prisoner. The underground are slipping him across the channel tonight. They want me to make the same arrangement as with the others. You want me to go to the coast, then on to the Professional Club with him? - Yes, exactly the same arrangements hold good. Be sure you carry all the necessary identification papers with you. I have them all in good order, Doctor. That's splendid. I never met Dr. Bruckner, but I feel we're doing a good thing for humanity helping our fellow scientists escape the Nazi yoke. You better get started. - Yes, Doctor. Dr. Ainsley. I lied to you yesterday afternoon. I did hear what you were saying about the grave. His grave. I see. I'm afraid for Sir Frederick to open it. Please, don't let them, Doctor. - There's nothing I can do to stop him, Andreas. Really, there's nothing for you to worry about. Why, I know you're right, Doctor, but I wish they weren't going to do it. Good night, Doctor. Andreas. Andreas. Andreas. Andreas. Andreas. You. You have no power over me. That was ended many years ago. I'm no longer your slave. Dr. Ainsley has cleansed me of all the evil you forced upon me. You can't bring it back. You can't. I won't let you, I won't. You're a fool, Andreas. A complete, utter fool. Your fate is to be what you are as mine is to be what I am, your master. Come here. I won't. I won't. Look at me, Andreas. Look at me. Andreas. Come here. Master, you have come back. Lady Jane Ainsley and Professor Walter Saunders imprisoned me. Deprived me of life for the past 23 years. It was my curse that caused Professor Saunders's recent death. It shall not be as simple for Lady Jane. How will you do it, Master? Through those she loves the most. Come, Andreas. I must find a new resting place. There, you will bring the coffin with my native soil. And then, Andreas, I have other plans. Master. - Well, you were successful? - Yes, Master. There were two men in the boat when it landed on the beach. It was very dark, and they didn't see me. Their bodies, Master, are lying at the bottom of the channel with rocks about their feet. Here are his clothes. His wallet. His identification and his ring. No one, not even Lady Jane, will ever suspect. Now, all that remains is for me to take you to the Professional Club where you will be welcomed as... This is it. But what about the vault? Who took him out of there? Professor Saunders and I took the coffin and buried it here, an unknown grave. We were determined that no one should ever again find Tesla. - You're absolutely certain this is the spot? Oh, yes. We mapped the location. Between this one of Fairchild and this one here of Smidley. This is, or rather was the grave, Sir Frederick. That's right, sir. There was an unmarked grave here, sir. Copped a direct hit too and all. Do you know anything about this grave? - No, it was here when I got here 12 years ago. - All right, you can go. - Thank you, sir. Well, Lady Jane, now what? The Jerries seem to have rather taken things out of your hands. Yes, let's get back to the car. Then you're going to drop the inquiry? Well, you can't do much with a hole in the ground, can you? There's Sir Frederick. Excuse me a moment. Oh, good evening, Lady Jane. You know, if I hadn't known better I should have thought that- - That I was the bride. - Yes, how'd you know I was going to say that? I've been rehearsing it for an hour. You forget women's intuition. - Yes. - I'm sorry. I should have let you finish. - About this manuscript of Professor Saunders, do you think I ought to give it to Nicki? Oh. After all, she is his granddaughter. Oh, no, please, please let me have it. I don't want her ever to know anything about it. By Jove, perhaps you're right. It is rather grim, isn't it? - Good evening. - Oh, good evening. - I hear Dr. Bruckner's coming tonight, is that true? Yes, do you know him? - No, but he must be a queer sort of a duck. They tell me at the club he sleeps all day and works all night. Thank you, sir. Dr. Bruckner. Ah, Doctor, may I introduce myself? I'm Lady Jane Ainsley. - I have waited impatiently for this moment. I owe you so much, Lady Ainsley. Oh, this is Miss Nicki Saunders. Dr. Hugo Bruckner. And my son John Ainsley. How do you do? Charmed, indeed. I understand this is an engagement party. May I offer my congratulations and wish you, how do you say it in England, all the best. Thank you. Have you been in London before, Doctor? Years ago, for a very short while. I saw a few people. One of them was your grandfather, Professor Walter Saunders. Indeed? Oh, you knew the professor? I came in contact with him just once. You were a very little girl. - Now Doctor, I want you to meet Sir Frederick Fleet. I shall be delighted. Au revoir, young lady. I shall see you again. - I hope so. - Complete understanding of fear psychosis is essential if you want to control the mind of another. Sort of mind over matter business, what? Precisely, Sir Frederick. The mind is the greatest of all human forces. Control the mind and you control the body. - How right you are, Doctor. - When I entered the grounds, I noticed some buildings in the rear. Yes, they house my patients, but the laboratory is just through here. Would you care to see it? - It would be a privilege. If you'll excuse us, gentlemen. We shan't be long. Oh, Andreas. What in the world are you doing here at this hour of the night? - I thought I'd finish these tests, Doctor. - I don't think I've ever had such a faithful technician. I can never get him to go home. - I think we both owe Andreas a debt of gratitude. - Well, as you can see, we're very well equipped here. Wonderful. Wonderful. You have a fascinating place, indeed. - I should consider it an honor and a privilege if you would accept free run of this laboratory and of our hospital. What do you say? Thank you. I accept your offer. Splendid, Andreas, you will assist the doctor in every way you can. I will, Doctor. - Well, shall we go? - Yes, indeed. The lock's been forced. I put the manuscript in this drawer. It's odd, I grant you, but I shouldn't attach too much importance to it. Only the two of us knew it was there. No, I don't like it. You're not suggesting your vampire friend's on the loose again, are you? - I don't think it's a matter to be treated lightly. What? - I've been uneasy ever since we visited his grave. Oh, I know what you're going to say, but just the same, we didn't find his body. Oh, my dear lady, that's all over and done with. Whoever took that manuscript is human and no spook. You can bet your life on that, my dear. Well, I'm afraid I must be trodding on right now. I shouldn't worry too much about this business. There's an explanation and we'll find it. No, don't trouble to come to the door. Please, good night. Goodbye, thanks so much for coming. Not at all. I've got to thank you for an excellent dinner. Thank you. Good evening, Dr. Bruckner. I am going to my room now. Nobody must disturb me, nobody. Do you understand? I sleep during the day. Quite, quite. Well. Nicki, I am waiting for you. Come to me, Nicki. I'm here, Nicki. Nicki, come to me. It is useless for you to struggle. Come. I am waiting for you. Who are you? Why have you forced me to come here? You read your father's manuscript. Look at me, Nicki. Now tell me who I am. You are Armand Tesla. But Tesla is dead. I am Tesla. And I can never die. And you are mine, mine forever. But before I take you away from here. there are many things I will make you do for me. Then you will go with me to my native country where no deaths can claim you or tear us apart. Your mind is no longer your own. I shall command and you shall obey. Look at me, Nicki. Look at me. Lady Ainsley, come quickly. Lady Ainsley. Nicki. What is it? Call a nurse at once. Yes, milady. - Hurry. - Yes, milady. What's the matter with her? Wait for me downstairs. I'll be able to tell you more later. It's ghastly. Unbelievable. A transfusion is all I can do for now. - Let's take her right away from here, anywhere, miles away. Now, don't get panicky, dear. That won't help Nicki. But something must be done. Something is going to be done. I understand from the caretaker that you are the two gentlemen. who helped clean up the cemetery after the big blitz. Yes, we are that, ma'am. Were many of the bodies disturbed? - Well, maybe half a dozen, ma'am, more or less. - Do you remember seeing one of an old man, a very old man with a spike in his heart? Yes, we do, ma'am. But how did you know? Can you tell me what became of him? We pulled the spike out, ma'am. Did anything happen while you were pulling out the spike or afterward? Yes, it did, ma'am. We heard a sort of gasp, a low moan. But it couldn't have been him, or could it? What happened then? We buried him again, ma'am. All nice and cozy like. Could you show me where? Here. Here we are, ma'am. Blimey, he's 'opped it. Law love a duck. Who would go and steal a dead corpse? Where did you get that ring? I found it, ma'am. It was laying there in the dirt. Is it yours? - Mine? Oh, no. No, it came off the corpse. - Here, ma'am, have it with my compliments. - Pardon me, ma'am, I've gotta go with Horace. - I've been trying to tell you for the last hour it's no longer a question of accepting or believing. Armand Tesla is alive. You now have concrete evidence, his attack on Nicki. Rubbish, my dear lady. There's a natural explanation to this thing and I mean to find it. I'll give you all the protection possible, but I will not believe in galloping ghosts. Then there's no more to be said. It's half past five. I'll have to get back to Nicki before dark. Is John going through with his concert tonight or is that all off? John will be there. Goodbye. - Goodnight. Lynch, I've got an idea. Really, sir? Yes, really. - Splendid, sir. - Oh leave that thing alone. There's a man who assists her ladyship called Andreas Obry. Hey, there, wait a minute! We wanna have a talk with you. - What have you got in that bundle, my lad? Come on, hand it over. Keep away from me. That wasn't a man. That was a wolf. You say he was carrying this bundle? Yes, sir. Bruckner. What happened then? - We asked him to show us what was in the bundle. First he seemed scared and then he jumped us, sir. - You mean you two big men couldn't handle him? - We did have the best of him, sir, until he- He turned into a wolf, sir. He did what? - He turned into a wolf, sir, right in front of our eyes. - First there are vampires then men in coffins disappear from the cemetery and now a man turns into a wolf. You haven't by any chance a rabbit up your sleeve, have you? Or an elephant in your hat? What do you take me for? For nothing, sir. It's the truth, sir. Show him. What's this? Hair, sir. I pulled them out during the fight. There can be no mistake, sir. We saw it quite plainly. What do you want? - This report came from the laboratory earlier this evening. You weren't in, sir. It is the finding of this laboratory that the exhibit in this report taken from the Ainsley Sanatorium is wolf hairs. Well, of course, I may be crazy. What are you doing, Elsa? - Just drawing the blackout curtains, Miss Nicki so we can turn on the lights. Leave them alone. Don't you love the night and the darkness? The soft, lovely darkness, there's so much mystery in it. - For my part, Miss Nicki, I prefer the daylight where one can see what's what. Are you feeling better? Very much better, Elsa. Why don't you go get your supper? I'll go later. Lady Ainsley said you were not to be left alone. Very well. Nicki. Nicki. You must go to him. Now, Nicki. What's the matter with you? Nicki, you shouldn't be out of bed. Stop that, Stevie, I don't know what's the matter with him. He never acted that way before with you. Get out, get out, be quiet. You shouldn't have left your room like this. You knew I'd say goodbye before I went to the concert. Nicki, Nicki, what's the matter? Nicki? I was afraid you'd forgotten. I love you so very much. Hello, Van, is everything all right? I was delayed in the blackout. Did Mr.John get off to the concert? I believe so, milady, although I didn't actually see him leave. Excuse me. Hello, yes, this is the Ainsley residence. It's the concert hall, milady. - Oh, I'll take it. Hello, yes. This is Lady Ainsley. What? I don't know anything about it. I'll see about it at once. That was the manager. He says my son hasn't arrived at the hall. See if he's in the library. I'll go up to his room. - Yes, milady. John. John? John. - Well, Dr. Bruckner, what have you to say about this? Is this a police interrogation? - Now look here sir, don't beat about the bush. Do you believe this was an attack by a vampire? - There are many strange things in the world, Sir Frederick. Vampires may be one of them. Ah. - And you still say there is no such thing as a vampire? I repeat, Armand Tesla is one and he lives. With Nicki already in his power he has set out to destroy John too. Heaven knows who may be his next victim. Nicki, your eyes. I never saw them so queer. Stop staring at me like that. Nicki. Nicki. Andreas. Andreas, we'd like to speak to you for a few moments. What do you want? - Did you take a manuscript from my desk several nights ago? A manuscript, Doctor? I don't understand. What were you doing outside the Professional Club at three this morning? Well? Why are you asking me these questions? Why are you looking at me like this? Let me see your hands. Let me see your hands. So now you know. Yes, I took the manuscript. Where is Armand Tesla? I'll never tell. You'll never find him no matter how hard you try. You can never destroy the master. He'll live forever. And you're too late to save John and the Saunders girl. - Poor Andreas, what a tragedy to lose his soul again after struggling for so many years to find it. - My dear Jane, how you can feel any sympathy for a creature like that is beyond me. But don't you understand? He's not responsible for his actions while under the domination of Tesla. - Anyway, my men will pick him up within an hour. In the meantime, dear lady, you better come along with me. I have a surprise for you. Never mind your orders. I'm Sir Frederick Fleet of Scotland Yard. I'll take you to his room, sir. Thanks. It looks as though he was asleep, doesn't it? I can't understand it, sir. He came in a little before daylight and he hasn't gone out. I'm sure of that. Perhaps he sleeps under the bed. Oh, no, sir. He'd hardly do that. What about the fire escape? There is none, sir. And it's a three-story drop from here to the ground. - Well, he may be somewhere in the building. Make inquiries, will you? - Certainly, sir. - May I ask why this sudden interest in Dr. Bruckner? Oh, it's not sudden, dear lady. I've been interested in the gentleman from the start. Would you like to hear my little surprise? Bruckner, Hugo. Age, 62. - 62? - Mm-hm. Bald, heavily built and walks with a limp. There's your real Dr. Bruckner. Then who is this man? A very fishy customer. And that monstrosity Andreas is somehow tied up with him. - Sir Frederick. - Mm-hm? Now I have a little surprise for you. Do you notice anything peculiar about this room? No. By Jove, yes. It's not broken. I wonder who'd turn a mirror to the wall like that. Hello, what's this? That ring belonged to Armand Tesla. I got it from a laborer at the cemetery after the bombing. You'll remember, I showed it to you at your office. Yes, I remember. Dr. Bruckner stole it then? - Oh, no he didn't. It belongs to him. That ring proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that Dr. Bruckner is Armand Tesla, vampire, whose face casts no reflection. That's why he turned the mirror to the wall. I must know about John. Don't worry about John. He's going to be all right. Does he know everything? He knows and understands. What did he say? He said he loves you very much. - How much longer can he go on loving me knowing that I- But John has always loved you. He always will no matter what happens. The sun is going down, isn't it? Oh, if I could only hold back the night, keep it from getting dark. That's when I hear those voices whispering to me, telling me what to do. If there were only some way to stop this terrible thing. Lady Jane, you've got to help me. I will, darling, I will. Nicki, Nicki, look at me. I want you to answer just one question, is Dr. Bruckner Armand Tesla? I don't know, I don't know. All I can hear is that voice. Then my mind seems to go. I think I've found the answer. Only it may involve terrible risk for you. I don't care about myself. Anything, just so long as John is safe. May I keep this for the time being? If you wish. Thank you, dear. Just trust me. - Come along, Elsa. - But milady- Don't ask any questions. Just come along. - Sir, Peters. - Yes, sir. Dr. Bruckner, I didn't see you come in. I didn't come in, Peters. I haven't been out. Are there any messages? - No, sir. Can you be reached at Dr. Ainsley's? I shall be there. Whether I can be reached is quite another matter. - Where did he go? - Where did who go? Bruckner, the chap we're after. Nobody came out this way. Why, he just stepped out this door. Not this door, he didn't. Now, look here, with my own very eyes, these here in the middle of my face. I just saw him come out. And I say nobody came out. - I'm not going to like it when Sir Frederick hears of this. Good evening, Lady Ainsley. I've been expecting you, Dr. Bruckner. - So at last through Andreas, you learned who I am. How great must be your satisfaction to realize how well you cured him. There is good in Andreas's soul, good that I have placed there and which even you cannot destroy, Armand Tesla. What a fool you are. With all of your scientific knowledge you have achieved nothing. You are too late to stop what I have set out to do. I have waited for this moment for a long time. Tonight I will take Nicki away. Her soul will wander through the night and you will never find where her body rests. And then, in another form she will come back for John. You're lying. You attacked my son and made Nicki believe that she did it. You're a very brilliant woman. But a foolish one to pit your strength against mine. It is possible that you may take Nicki, but there is something stronger than even you. Something greater that you have forgotten. You are evil. But even the power of evil cannot stand against the power of faith and goodness. And with that power, you will be destroyed. Lady Jane. Is everything all right? - Bruckner was here. - Already? Well, he won't get out of the house. I've got the whole place surrounded. You won't take him that way. If you don't listen to me now, you'll never take him. Nicki. The time has come. I am waiting for you. You must follow my voice. Nothing can keep you from me. Follow my voice. Nothing can keep you from me. Follow my voice. Follow. - I've listened to your ridiculous theories long enough. I'm out to capture two men and I'm going to get them. But Sir Frederick I- Wait. She's under the hypnotic control of Bruckner. Oh, nonsense. There's only one way to find him and that's for Nicki to lead us to his grave herself. - But Jane- - Now you listen to me. I may be risking her life as well as my son's, but it's our only salvation. We must follow her. It's my way or none at all. - But it's preposterous. I tell you it's the only way. Are you going to help me follow her or do I have to see this through alone? All right. The night is our friend, Nicki. I will protect you and bring you to me. Bring you to me. Bring. You're almost to me, Nicki, just a little further. Just a little further. Further. Closer, Nicki. Closer. And we will be together, just you and I, together. For heaven's sake, Sir Frederick. Don't shoot again. Pick her up, pick her up. Nicki! Nicki! Nicki, Nicki! Oh Sir Frederick, we've lost them. Help me, Master. I'm hurt. What is that to me? But I'll die. You must not let that happen, Master. You promised me life eternal. Like yours, forever. I no longer need you, Andreas. Your usefulness is over. You must not say that, Master. Get away from me. Idiot. Get back to that corner. Remain there to die. There is no power great enough to keep you from me. I have won. You are saved, Andreas. Because I have taught you the meaning of goodness. You hold it now, locked tightly in your heart. And nothing evil can ever stand against it again. Always remember that goodness is the strongest force in the world and that all evil cannot prevail against it. Remember that and you will be strong. Strong. Andreas, go back, go back. I'm your master. You must obey. Go back. You are my master no longer. You are evil. You must be destroyed. For years I've lived in terror of you. I'd wake up screaming in the night because I thought you'd come back. And I was your slave again. because I forgot what Dr. Ainsley had taught me. But now that is over. I am going to destroy you forever. - Every member of the force is looking for them. - They must be found before daylight or it will be too late. - You've fought every move I've tried to make in this case. You've got some silly absurd notion- Oh, please. Yes, what? Whereabouts? Right. They've found them. - Oh, thank heaven. Oh, Nicki. - Lady Jane. - Where are the other two? - Over here, sir. Lady Jane, it was Andreas. He destroyed him. Andreas. I'll be home soon, darling. Well, there's one of them, Andreas. Doesn't look much like a werewolf now, does he? He isn't now, poor Andreas. He found his soul after all. May he have peace forever. But who this blighter is, I don't know. He looks to me more like a bundle of rags and bones. Looks as if he'd been lying there for some time. That, my dear Sir Frederick, is all that is left of Armand Tesla. Now do you believe in vampires? - My dear Jane, must you go back over all that? Very well, then. If it isn't Tesla or Bruckner perhaps you'll tell me who it is. Say, you fellas don't believe in this vampire business, do you? Yes, sir, we do. And do you people?
