A maniac grandfather.. The asshole's also from our province. What happened? Is he sentenced? Yeah. A long time ago. Reclusion Perpetua. Life imprisonment? Not death penalty? That's during Ramos administration. This guy might get parole and continue doing crimes. - Director, your coffee. - Thank you. Sexy movie? Sexy theme! Alright. Make sure it's explicit. Thank you, bossing! Start shooting right away! Are you willing to give a free and voluntary affidavit? Without being threatened and forced? And answer my questions with nothing but the truth? Yes. Your name? Sir, your coffee. - Thank you. - Florinda Labrador. Age? 16. Address? City 3, Maglake Street. San Jose, Bulacan. What's the reason for filing an affidavit on this police station? She was raped by her grandfather. Unbelievable. Grandpa still has high libido, huh? What's the name of your grandfather? Gabino Labrador. San Nicolas! We're about to leave! Are you sure the weight's correct? Why would I ever dupe you? Here's the 1,000 pesos. Thank you. No boyfriend? Yeah, that's the truth. What do you think of us? But you're not Floring! Right, Floring? Don't touch me! Floring! Grandpa? Go home! So this is what you're doing after classes? You're flirting with men? Go! Leave! Go home! She'll likely get scolded again. Didn't knew her grandpa's strict. Blame yourself for pulling her close to you. Go down. Go! - What's with that nonsense? - Grandpa! Walk quickly! Quick! - It hurts! - I said, hurry up! Quick! Goddamn! Stand up! Please wait for me, I got sprained. Damn you! Where is it? Here? Still hurts? Ouch! Ouch! Don't move, Ouch! Hurry up! Move! Go! Walk! - Go! - Dad! Why? What happened to Floring? This girl.. Your kid.. I saw her flirting with men on the plaza! With Lita! She don't want to go home. This kid gave me a hard time. I needed to drag her home. Hey, you. Once I caught you flirting again there, I'll stop your schooling. Go in! Floring, what happened? Mom.. Perla! Prepare for dinner. I'm starving. Ah, yes! Floring.. Who did this? Grandpa.. Perla, what's the matter? - Help me assist her! - Okay, okay. Slowly. - Perla, calm down! - Put it in. - Let it in. - Stop crying. Stop crying.. Go push it in. Do it slowly! Compose yourself, Perla. That's enough. Continue the burial. Assist her, she might pass out. - Perla! - A pity. Perla, open the door! Goddamn! Dad? Dad? I'll crush your face. No, please! Dad! Damn that kid! Excuse me! Can I ask a question? What is it? Do you know Florinda Labrador? Floring? Floring! - Floring! - Mrs. Bacaltos? Ma'am, what brings you here? Floring, how are you? Got a baby there? Sadly, none. It's been a year, still nothing? Your husband's weak, no? Where's your mother? Mom, Mrs. Bacaltos is here. Mrs. Bacaltos.. What brings you here? I am with the director and the writer of Silver Films! Ah, director.. Here's Perla. Floring's mother. Good morning. Excuse my hands, they're dirty. Eh, director.. Here's Floring. So you're Floring.. There's Oca, Floring's husband. They're married for a year. What can we do for you? They're from Manila. They want to make a movie based on both of your stories! They'll even get me as an extra cast! Right, director? He looks like Richard Gomez. You! Do you want to be an extra? To be eaten by crocodiles? Oca, leave now. Mrs. Sanchez is waiting for that. Oca, buy me some peanuts please. Sure. It's better if we talk about this inside. Excuse our place, it's messy. Okay. Let's go. Our film is out of the box! Seriously! We are decent filmmakers. Pardon my interruption but, what approach are you taking for the movie? Will you show every single event? We'll only show what the story needs. If there are bold scenes, it'll be contextual. And also.. The execution's artistic. As for the rape scene, it'll be just a part of the film. I'll be focused on the drama of you two. Right, Frankie? Director.. Floring, get a glass of water for our visitor. He's right. Our film will be focusing on the drama aspect. Our intention is to create a socially-relevant film that will reflect life's reality. So that, our film can be an instrument for change on our society. Right, director? Thank you. Oh, I agree! That's good. Unlike other directors out there, producing shameless sexy movies. No lesson to ponder on. You're right! Our movie will have lesson to share. If Madam didn't take actions, will she even get her justice? - Right? - Yeah. I don't know.. That would be embarrassing.. No worries, our producer will pay for the story rights. That's the right thing to do! They need to pay Perla! It's not about the payment. We don't want to remember what happened and you're asking to make a movie out of it. Look for other people's story instead. Excuse me. If you don't mind me asking, how much will you be paying her? It depends. Excuse me. Hey, have you bought peanuts? I forgot it. How annoying! Just kidding! Here it is. Have you talked to the director? They'll give you 100,000 pesos. You can buy a lot of things with that money! Even so, it's still embarrassing. But they'll anonymize you. No one will ever know that it's your life they're filming. If you have that money, you can have your house fixed. Why do I need to fix and renovate our house? I remember someone offering a pre-owned concrete house to Oca for only 80,000 pesos. Don't you want that? You can buy a concrete house! If she agrees, start the interview immediately. But if not, create a fiction out of the news. No problem with that but we can't call it true-to-life story anymore. Dennis. I ran away from home. Can I temporarily stay here? I can't bring you to Manila, Perla. You know I'm married. How about me? Go home. You said you loved me. I'm married! But I'll not live with you. Where will you stay? Perla, you'll be in peril in Manila. It's your fault for leaving home after being scolded. You told me you loved me.. Go home. After that, what did you do? Did you go home? I went to my cousin on another city. He's a tailor. I lived there for around, three months. Mar was kind to me. But his wife can't keep her mouth shut. I think she's being jealous. That's when I found out that I'm pregnant. Before they kick me out, I left them. I don't want to go home but.. I have nowhere else to go. Dad.. You left home only to return again? Aren't you afraid that your Dad might rape you again? Will he be interested with me when.. I'm already pregnant. Madam, who impregnated you? Who impregnated you? Madam? Hey! Are you mute? Someone from Manila. A marketing agent for a cigarette brand. What happened? Why didn't he marry you? He's already married. Dad! Bless, please. Why are you coming home late? Where were you roaming? I just picked mangoes with Lita. Mom. Bless, please. Change your clothes, they're dirty. Get in. Yes. Dad, you're always wearing Mom's old underwear. Please change it, our neighbors might gossip about it. Why would I be ashamed? Why? Am I wearing their panties? Look! When did your grandpa raped you? I am with Lita after our classes. Go down. What's with that nonsense? Hurry up! - Quick! - Please stop, it hurts! You walk too slow! Hurry up! Grandpa.. Quick! Ouch.. What happened after? I can't remember anymore. Didn't you told the police, you were raped on the mango plantation? I can't remember it.. My heart almost burst. He did it to his grandchild. I'd rather let him abuse me, just don't touch Floring. Not my daughter.. I'm done with his evil doings. Even if he's my Dad, fuck him! Fuck him! Who do you want to act your life? I hope it's my idol.. Who's your idol? Judy Ann Santos. This looks good. Bro, let's watch that one. Looks good. 2 seats near the screen. He did not went through with the plan again. We can't trust him showing up. - He might be busy? - Nah, it's typical of him. I agree. Here. Hayok sa Laman ( Lust for the Flesh ) - Slowly.. - Quick! Hurry up! It's almost 3:00 PM! First showing day! We might be late at the screening. Oca, the radiator is smoking. If that doesn't get fixed, we might have to walk home. Did you bring your sweater? Manila's cinemas are cold. How about the flashlight? Thanks for the reminder. Where did I put it? Didn't they have dogs inside the cinema? Go down slowly. Will it be safe to leave the vehicle here? Will someone be interested with this old vehicle? They have guards. Floring! We might miss the start of the film! Where's your Mom? Hurry up, Mom. Your Mom's busy applying make-up She's putting lipstick. - Let's wait for Perla to finish. - She's prepared for this, huh? Join us, there might be reporters to interview us. Wait me, here I go! Wow, she's pretty! No, I'm beautiful even back then.. What are you doing? Slow down! Move! Go to the other side. It's because you're teasing me. Floring! Hurry up! She's excited. - Slow down. - Hurry, we need to secure our seats! Linda's too excited. - That's the director.. - Yeah Farewell. Goodbye.. Let's go. We'll close it. - I can't believe he'll do that.. - I agree. The umbrellas! Violeta. Dad? Your mom's gone, Violeta. No one will stop us now. - I heard an Aswang attacked the woman. - Really? - What? - That's true! Violeta's coming! Violeta! When will you give birth? Took your pregnancy seriously, huh? Violeta, be careful! Aswangs can smell pregnant women. Yeah, the Tiktik might attack you. Haven't you heard the news? An Aswang is roaming here. You might be attacked. Don't warn her.. She's already a victim. Violeta! I heard a relative impregnated you? Be careful! Who knows, your child might be the next victim. So that's like Janice's child? I know that there's Aswang here! Not one! But three! With the way you speak and how your attitude isn't aligned with Christianity's teaching! People should be afraid of you instead! Hypocrites! You're worse than an Aswang! Assholes! What a bitch! We're hypocrites? We are! Same with that Aswang! Stupid! Did we impregnate her? Push some more. There. Go, push! I'm seeing the baby's head. Just one more push, Violeta. More! More! What happened? She drowned. Drowned or an Aswang attack? I told you, there's an Aswang roaming here. Look! Teeth bites from Aswang on her neck! Ma? CHECK Mom! CHECK Violeta. Violeta! It's a girl. Get out of my sight! Move! Perla, I'd like to buy all of those. Just in time! We're done transferring it to containers. Please wait. Dad? Dad! Dad! - What did you say? - Cardo's here. Say it again. Repeat it. Dad. Say it again. Dad. Dad. Repeat it, please. Why did you cry? You just called me Dad earlier. Perla! Your daughter can speak! Floring? Repeat it, kid. Please. Let your Mom hear it. Let her hear it. Dad.. Dad.. Why don't you speak? She can speak already! She just called me Dad earlier. Go up here. You'll be late on your class. Hasmin! Hasmin! Floring, that's you! You're sexy. Stop it. Mom, let's go. That's enough. Hasmin's sexy. She's normal, after all. Stupid. Of course, Floring's normal. Perla might hear you. What's with that look? Get the chicken I undressed. Here's your clothes. Does she make friends with other people? That kid has inferiority complex. And she's light-headed. Can someone give me an example of a complex sentence? - Mam! - Mam! Florinda Labrador? I don't know, Ma'am. - Ma'am! - Nicanor Orogo. My grandpa is my Dad. My Dad is my grandpa. Stop that! - Fuck you! - Fuck you too! Watch your mouth! Don't curse in my class. He's always making fun of Floring. I'm just giving an example! Tess and Orogo, you stay here after the class. You.. Ador Finiquito. Give an example of a complex sentence. I don't know, Ma'am. All of you don't know anything? You're not studying our lessons. Get a pen and paper. We'll have a quiz now. You're being unfair, Ma'am. Good morning, Miss Bacaltos. Good morning. You may sit down. Thank you, Ma'am. Did you prepare for our recitation today? - Yes, Ma'am. - No, Ma'am. Goddamnit! In my class, I expect everybody to be prepared every time. All the time. I don't care if you're not prepared or not! I will go through our graded recitation right now. Whether you like it or not. Miss Jasmin San Miguel. Give me an example of a complex sentence! My mother is cooking and singing. Wrong! Very wrong! For god's sake! Quiet there, Miss Benequito! Miss San Miguel. I will really plank you if you do not study harder. You understand? Yes, Ma'am. Miss Benequito. Complex sentence please. My father is my grandfather and my grandfather is my father. Fuck you! Motherfucker! Listen! San Miguel! Stop it! Stop it! That's not allowed! You stupid head! My wig! My wig! Someone hold her! Stop that! Stop it! You're disgusting! Stop it, stop it! Ma'am, your tattoo looks good! Oh no, I'm exposed! Disrespectful! Disrespectful! I'm her only best friend because I'm the only one who can understand her being weird. What do you mean? Lita! Lita! Why are you hiding from me? Where are you? You don't want me angry. Don't even try me. Where are you? Damn that kid. - Damn, you're making it hard for me! - Dad! What a hardheaded kid! You're resisting, huh? - I'll punish you for that. - No, spare me. Stop that! That tickles! I'm done. Hey Lita, that's Oca. Oca! Stop flirting. The sun's down, your Dad will be mad. Let's go! What happened? Cramps? A snake bit me. Where? On my leg. Look. That snake's venomous. Are you bitten elsewhere? You're naughty. Don't move. Ouch. What's with the look? Do I look like a snake? It's the first time I met you here. Who are you? I'm Adan. I work at Don Rafael Montenegro's hacienda. Good afternoon. - Who are you? - Hasmin! What happened to my daughter? - Bitten by a snake. - Oh my God! Snake bite? That's what happens when you roam anywhere! Where's the bite? Let me see! Are you from here? - He's working at.. - Let him answer! I work at Don Montenegro's hacienda. You killed the snake? No. Alright. I'll kill all of them! Return to hacienda before I mistake you as a snake and kill you too. Don't ever return here. Go! Let's go. Let's go! - Please excuse his behavior. - That's fine. Boil a pail of water! Coming! Is Oca good at kissing? - Floring, can I visit you? - Dad will be mad. What are you doing? One more? That's enough. Hey, what are you doing? Give it back! Only if you can get it! Hasmin! Shit! Look where you are going! - I'm sorry. - My God! Hasmin, give me my underwear! Excuse me. Are you continuously.. Being touched? What do you mean? Are you continuously being raped by your Dad? What kind of question is that? Does your Dad continue on raping your mom? Yes, when Dad's drunk. Perla. Perla! Perla. Perla, daughter. Open the door. Perla! Will you open the door or not? One! Two! Fuck it! Dad.. - Don't resist, I'll hurt you. - Dad, please.. Just go. Hasmin! Why are you home late? Good evening, Dad. So you don't have plans to go home until it's already sunset? What did you do on the city? Who were you with? Look at her. She can't respond. Your kid already knows how to lie. Dad, at least let her eat before asking questions. Dad.. Finish your food. Hasmin! Where did you go? What's with the grass on your clothes? Who were you with? - Mom! - Tell me what you did! Mom! Dad.. She's probably flirting with guys. He's probably dating the guy who helped her before. Have a serious talk with her. If you ever go home late again, I'll amputate your legs! Where were you? Did you meet Adan? Mom, I'm not a kid anymore. That's exactly why your Dad is mad at you! But it's Sunday today. Can't I have time for myself? Do you understand me? Don't you ever make your Dad mad! - Okay. - Do you understand? Dad. Don't be mad. I already talked to Hasmin. That's.. That's sexually explicit. Is that scene needed? Why? Aren't you doing those too? - Hasmin! - Adan? When was the first time he tried to rape you? I can't remember anymore. It was when Floring got sick. What are you looking for? I think Floring's sick. I'll ask Carmen if they have paracetamol. Mrs. Carmen? Mrs. Carmen? Anyone home? Perla, what's the matter? Do you have paracetamol? Floring's sick. Wait there, I'll get one. - Wait inside. - No need. Your kids must be asleep. Okay, I'll be quick. Perla? Mrs. Carmen? - Here's the medicine. - Thank you! She's indeed sick. She has flu. Apply Vicks all over her body. Dad, you're home. How did it went? Were you able to give them salary? Yeah. Dad.. I just tried using Mom's lipstick. My daughter's really a lady now. I bought a new dress for you! Check if this fits you. Dad? Hasmin. What are you doing here? Mom.. - Dad.. - Your daughter.. I caught her using your lipstick. I'm just removing it. Why are you using it? I'm just trying it on.. You're just going to school, you don't need that. - Remove that. - Mom.. Who are you trying to seduce? Your Dad? What are you doing in our room? You're after your Dad? You don't have any shame? You're still young and all you think of is flirting! - Are you doing that on school too? - No, I don't.. Remove that! Before you're late for the class! Quick! I will. I'm really concerned for my daughter. From then on, I never left her alone. Why did you throw the radio? We'll go to the market. Damn that woman! Go to sleep. You need to wake up early. Buy some medicine for the animals. One of your pigs look sick. Blow the fire. I'm jealous. You bought a new dress for Hasmin. Then buy a new dress for yourself too. Blow that fire. Have you brought up her Dad's attempts to her? No, because.. She don't have any malice in her mind. Floring, please.. Open up your legs. I can't put it in. - Please! - No, I might get pregnant. - No.. - Oca, no. What happened? So, were you able to put it in or not? No, just on her legs. Could it be that your thing's too big that she's afraid of it? You're crossing the line. Have you had an experience with a gay? Are you gay? You.. Hasmin? What's happening? It's nothing. Just gargling. Adan! Hasmin! Hasmin, I thought of visiting you. My mom wrote to me with a good news! The court decision is out acknowledging that my parents are the real owners of our farm. My Dad is asking us to start a cooperative here on our province. You're leaving? Don't worry. I'll be back. Adan, take me too. Let's get married. Hasmin, you're too young. You're not done with high school. I'm not ready yet. I promise, after everything's fine, I'll get you back and we'll get married. Adan.. I'm pregnant. - Until the full moon. - I'll be waiting. Be honest with me. How long are you in a relationship? Dad, please understand us. We're both in love. Did he touch you? How many times did he touch you? - Only few.. - How many? - Twice.. - How many? Three times! Fuck it. If you badly want to get laid, you should have asked me to do it! Why? What does that Adan have that I don't have? Dad, no! No! Daughter.. My daughter.. that's enough. Oca, fan her. Fan her. Let's go to the vehicle. How do you feel now? Who do you want to act as you? Hopefully, my favorite actress.. What's her name? Judy Ann Santos. - Were you able to buy medicine? - Yes. Hasmin? Hasmin? Where are you? Hasmin? There you are. Hasmin. Know what? I found a bargain on the market. Dress, but buy one, take one. Let's take one each. The designs are also pretty. Look! Hasmin? Are you crying? What happened to you? Why are you.. crying? Dad.. What did he do to you? He raped me. Mom.. Don't accuse him of that! Dad.. What happened here? Tell me about what Hasmin said. You two! You're just my children, You're both my property. I'm feeding both of you so I make the rules. Dad.. What did you do to Hasmin? Your fucking daughter, Adan already fucked her three times. When we're not checking on her, that asshole's fucking her. Why? What's with Adan that I don't have? Dad don't.. I offer myself. Why go after her? I can service you in bed, just spare her please. Please, Dad. I offer myself. Hasmin will stop schooling. Watch after your kid. If she runs from home, I'll surely punish you. I'll kill you. Leave me alone. Dad.. No.. Hasmin, open the door. Will do! - Hasmin! - Wait for a bit! What's taking you so long? - What you doing? - Just cleaning my room. What does this mean? Where are your clothes? Where do you plan to go? Do you plan to escape from me? Fuck, do you think you can run from me? Stupid! Do you think I'm stupid? - No! - In denial? Fuck you. Dad, please stop! Mom! Mom, help me! Mom! Mom! Mom, help me! Damn you! I killed Dad.. My God, I killed him.. I stabbed.. Mom! Don Ramon's here! - What will we do? - Here. Quick! Close the door. Quick! Meet Don Ramon. Welcome him inside, prepare coffee. Don't let him go. - Quick! - Leon! Leon! Don Ramon. Hey Hasmin, I thought nobody's home. - Your Dad? - Get inside first. You don't have classes? Mom asked me to skip school to clean the house. - I'll prepare you a cup of coffee. - No need. I'll not be staying long. Leon? Leon? He's not here. Where is he? He went to the city. Is that so? When will he return? He might be late. That sucks. I have something for him. - I thought we'll have a drink. - Thank you. Where's Violeta? Be careful. If that breaks, your Dad will be mad. He treats that like a saint. Violeta. - How are you? - You just arrived? - Good afternoon! - Leon's not here? Not here. He went to Manila to visit a relative. He might be back on Sunday. What were you doing? You look like a mess. We slaughtered a pig. I thought your Dad's on the city? That's what I thought, too. I'll talk to your Mom instead. Don Ramon. What is it? Be careful, the ladder's slippery. Will do. Violeta. Don Ramon. I talked to a Chinese friend, and we'll do a business deal. We'll build a piggery here. Really? How's your well? Still has water? Still a lot. Can I check? What's that? Looks like something fell.. Looks like.. If I'm not mistaken.. Hold on.. Looks like.. That looks like a blanket. Yeah, it's stuck there. You should be boiling your water before drinking. That well looks dirty. Aren't you having upset stomach? No. We're used to drinking water from there. Tell Leon I'll be back next week with my friend. I'll tell him. Don't worry. When the construction start, I'll build you a water pump and I'll also add pipes to your house. - That way, you don't need this well. - Thank you! Alright, I'll be leaving. Adios, hija. - Adios. - Adios, Don Ramon. The travel time's too long. My driver's sick. Hasmin, the well! Don Ramon, be careful. Mom.. Come along with us. If Mom really died on that well.. She died thirsty.. she died.. I'm angry.. because I agreed.. I agreed.. For years, I held this pain inside me. As well as the truth that, he can kill me and use you in place of me. But I killed him first.. Mom.. You have escaped Dad. I'll continue on paying for my sins. The society will continue on mocking you. Forgive me. Forgive me.. We're both his victims. What's important, is he's dead. We're free from that animal. Someone's outside. Hasmin! - What do we do? - Let's leave this place. Damn you! Dad, no! Mom! Dad, stop! Mom, quick! Quick! You thought you can escape? Open the door! Mom! No! Hasmin! Adan! What happened here? I heard a gunshot! Dad will kill Mom! Hasmin! Your Dad's gone! That animal is dead! We're finally free! Mom! Leon! - Jaclyn Jose's acting is superb! - But a lot has changed from the truth. - Perla didn't kill Gabino. - But he's in jail, life sentence. - That feels like being killed too. - You're right. - Stupid, that's dramatic license. - Men like that deserves death, anyway. Yeah, uncontrollable libido. - That scene's really something. - Yeah. Is it true that Perla is Floring's kid with Gabino? - I'm surprised too. - Told you. Perla and Gabino looks like husband and wife. - Really? - Floring is Perla's kid with his Dad! What a gross family tree. Be careful. So the rumors are right, they're flirting with each other. Is your friend a flirt? They changed a lot from the facts. Only the ending. Perla knows that his father touched her. But she's still going home to him. How can you justify that? Funny that Perla had gone insane. Psychology says incest victims develop trauma. Be quiet. Perla might have heard us. Yeah. What now? Floring, how are you? Dizzy? - Perla, go sit in the front. - We're already set. We're not moving. Let's go on the front. Let's not treat Oca as our driver. Let's go so we can get home before sunset. How about we eat first? Let's eat along the way. I know an eatery in Plaridel. Perla might want to take a rest already. - That's right. - Then let's go straight home. It's a waste you did not watch until the end. The suspense ending is good. Oca, let's leave. English subtitles by RSG for KG. Thank you for not removing this credits.
