This film is based on the story that happened in the 22nd year, the Joseon Dynasty. In 1506, the Prime Minister led the rebel forces to make Prince Jin Sung (Jung Jong) as the new king. However, only a diversion to take back the royal throne. But because King Jung Jong is careless. Making the whole country in chaos ... It is okay. It should make sure we are infected or not, Then you just kill it, don't you. Don't you hear? What are you waiting for... Kill everything. Your motherfucker. Let this child live, he is not sick, he is just a child. I beg you not to kill him. Don't kill him. Mother... - MONSTER - All people are stupid, they are confused. There has been news that happened in a strange and frightening voice. Whatever news is heard, how is that? We don't need to be confused with it all, of course. When finding the truth, it can calm this confusion. According to a book about the existence of a monster on Mount Renwang. It can also be said as a wild animal that no one has seen before. This creature can also be regarded as a terrifying giant. Your Majesty, you should not be shaken by this. Although before this news had spread throughout the people. We have to decide everything right. The Prime Minister already knows, right. Is this a trick? Is that what you want to hear? The monster also makes people anxious and threatens safety. That was also thought by the Prime Minister, right. Do you want to accuse me? If the King is not wise, disaster will always occur. Why do disasters appear like this? The previous king has been willing to sit on this throne, not to make you like this. If the King was right beforehand, I would directly investigate all this troubling. How can I be brave. You can't shut up. Am I noisy, then what? - Geez. - Not me. If we haven't got any rabbits before, It seems that the rumor is true. What rumors? The appearance of strange creatures, Eat livestock and other animals too. You believe in foolish talk, eaten by strange creatures. Make sure the trap is there. It's not a matter of trap. Aissh ... Look, there won't be a problem with the trap. I'm very good at making traps. This place is connected in four directions, My expertise is able to make animals be tempted with my wish. Iii ... Is this a look !? What happened? Like you said, there is no problem with the trap. Brother, please. Disappointing. As a hunter, how come it can fall in its own trap. Myung, help me down. Myung, help me. Brother. Where? Where? Not here, there there. Where did you say Back? Right or left side. Here I mean, right side. - Geez, you're not very sensitive. - Come here, you. I can't be with him, come down and help catch. What kind of fish do you catch? I'd better just look for wild vegetables. Hurry up, just come down here. - I water your water, let's go down. After all you're wet, let's go fast. Come on, catch the fish. 10 years friends, still don't know what I'm thinking. What else do fish think? Yes, you are. Daddy, there's a big fish here. - Where? - here. - Where to catch it - Where? There !! How big is the fish? No such thing! God, you are this. Ouch my stomach, I don't eat anything. How come my stomach hurts like this? The pain. Why? What is wrong? Is there a sound in your stomach? Yes, as if I want to throw up. That's the level of anger and the longest in water. Maybe because of that. Oh, yes? The doctor said that if you take warm medicine you can eliminate bloating too. Why does it feel like this? Don't waste, drink the medicine. You know, my stomach is weak. Fish porridge smells good. It's wild vegetable porridge instead of fish porridge. Where is the salt? There is no food on the mountain, we go to Hanyang. If it's to Hanyang, does food fall from the sky? Here are wild vegetables, fruits, fresh fish is also available. I like meat. Myung, go to the fields and get the radish. There. Quick, drink it. Do not move. Why sneak in my house. Don't move, I say. Who are you, why are you here? I'm looking for a master in this house. Sir? There is no master here. Isn't that what lives here, ever been the guardian of the king? Guardian of the king? What does it mean? He is always there with His Majesty. Troops consisting of people the most powerful and good at martial arts. Crap, where are there people like that in my house? What do you mean, are you here? What is wrong? Why is it so noisy? General, I'm the guard who serves His Majesty. Geez, what happened? Basic. Father, are you really a king's guardian? Right, me too. Why do you answer, which can be trusted. Previously nothing could match his greatness in Joseon. Yeah, after that I'm the person. This person is indeed good at lying. Just catching a rabbit can't, let alone kill people. Right, you're wrong. We hunters who spend all day to hunt. Never mind going home there. Your Honour... Is he the kid? Do you still hate me? Is my isolation enough to cover up this problem? Is this your Majesty's will? - That girl. - How dare you use your pity to compare with His Majesty. Insult. Your Majesty, he will take the child. To be sure there are no more contagious diseases. It must be destroyed immediately. Destroy. I already told anyone who spoke with people who have been infected, they will be infected too. You see. I saved this child from there and came here. I'm not infected and I'm fine. Why does the Prime Minister look like that? It's all just your intention to trigger blood growth in front of His Majesty. This is only to get rid of my loyalty to the palace. Only your conspiracy strategy, no. Shut up. For Your Majesty's sake, anything will be done. Catch him and kill the kid. Stop it Your Majesty, for your sake ... I have served Your Majesty with all my heart. Please forgive his life. Go away, don't come back again. Your Majesty, why are you being like this? Obviously, the sky will be angry Behind His Majesty and court If this life I can't keep this child, what's the use of this sword? I want to be with a guard who can keep me from those who are corrupt. But they even slandered him. They spread the disease able to change hearts so. And you help him with your sincerity. My eyes are closed so is my mouth. If at that time you remained with the child, you would have been killed. I don't want to lose you anymore. Soon they will use that monster, let me falter. I don't want to be their king, but the king of my people. Accept this sword again? Brother, what are you doing? Come on, to Hanyang. Hanyang? Uncle, get ready. Hey, like this? Not like this. Are you unconscious or what, it's not possible right. When I'm in trouble, You're always there, I'm very grateful. You are also my savior. You're mistaken. I want to avoid what happened in that direction. I'm not lucky, I shouldn't be your subordinates for their crime. What is this? Oh dear, I don't understand how I can say this for loyalty. Father. Uncle, wait for me. - father. - Already completed. Wait for me, wait for me. Geez, shit. They say the mountain. Forgive, this alarming person. Why does it suddenly rain? Take a break and then leave. Bad, bad. Whenever there is rain, anything will appear. Here is a former village and someone saw ... The giant crushed the tiger's body. I already know... Did you hear something? You are crazy. You damn man, should you be surprised so much? And what else is feared, just rest later. What are you doing? Is this really Hanyang? Geez, the child is dead. What is this, why is this like Hanyang. God, my goodness. This is it. What can this eat ... Is this rice soup or just a bowl? Is this just in town? So beautifull. Oh, did I hear this first time? Only this Hanyang can be eaten. General, you've been trying hard to come here. You should rest, but there is a problem. Anu, isn't it after eating? God damn it. Auntie, just leave it here, I'll be back again. Massacre, massacre. That's a big god who was cut off. Many people are jealous of this mountain. - Miss. - Hey, Myeong ... This girl has no fear? Hey, don't touch. How can men be afraid? Similar to morning breakfast soup. Too bad. The first are drug sellers. Now, many want to catch that monster to get a position. They die horribly like burning fire. There is a prohibition on guards to this mountain. Until the fortune teller too. Who found this incident? Did you see something? What is that? Strange creature. Father, please see this. It looks like it's cut with a knife. I have something to investigate. Go find another witness. Yes. Watch Out Why are you chasing the girl? He was not afraid when answering something strange. I don't think so. Who is he? You're following that person, fast. Well. What is that? What? Stop. Hey, come here. Aishh ... Friends. Let us eat. Do not be like that. You also eat. Did you really see that monster? Is it true that you saw that monster, I asked? Why are you lying? If I say that to you, I will give food. Who told you to do it. Do not know Are you hungry, should you lie about that monster? Even though I don't see it, the monster really exists. For fear of monsters, nothing more can be done. Although afraid of men too can't get food other than to the mountain. I can't find another witness. How are the other bodies? Similar to a witch's body Wrists and legs resemble those of a witch. There are bond marks. Who gave the children food? Look, I can't catch it, because suddenly fled. - Monster ... - Monster. Please save me Did you see that monster? They all die. Myeong. Is dead. Make sure there are how many bodies. Yes, I understand. I will go with him. You talk like this. I will continue to help find other bodies. This... There is also a corpse too. Are there weapons that can be like that, huh? Not animal claws, so many cuts and abrasions This Is this slimy. Damn ... I was shocked. How can it hang? When you see a dead body not afraid, it turns out that Miss is indeed extraordinary. You also seem to be a spoiled man, right. Your hands look smooth. Where did you study medicine? Used too boring, I occasionally read medical books. With this I can become a medical woman at Huimin, that's my dream. Mr. guard, can you catch mice? Rat? This is the corpse of the impact of the monster. Look at this form of cruelty. The monster is only the beginning. What do you think? It's a matter of humanity. This scar is likened to an eagle's claw. Known as singing or ringing arrows Collect the results of a corpse investigation at the crime scene These bodies are only cut in the arms and have a complete body. That means someone cuts their legs. What do you mean? - Not everyone - What are you saying? This merchant died after seeing the monster with his own eyes. As you can see, there was a strange lump on his body. Among these bodies, two were found like this. Others are not found. Does that monster really exist? A bacterium is found in a corpse injected into mice. After about one hour, a lump will appear and they will die in less than half a day. This is more contagious than any disease. Is the monster the cause? Not. This is all indeed the beginning of the purpose of the bad situation. That monster, nothing. No, there really is a monster. Despite fear, the most feared by the people, their feelings still assume the monster is there. Days change, as soon as possible confront the monster. Choose soldiers from Jeolla and Gyeongsang to be the one that I think about. What do you think? Soldiers are used to prevent war, if these soldiers are moved Afraid of suffering a bigger disaster To catch bad animals, people will be more nervous. Only to get rid of anxiety before looking for it Then, shut up and just watch it? It takes time for the army to move, and people will feel nervous. First, ask for help outside the city for find out. How about that? That's the power to catch tigers, do not need to be specially trained for this. The Prime Minister continues to staunchly establish, like this is just catching a tiger. It is not like that? How many people are there? Plus a total of 700 people It can't be, it's not controlled by the army. Can't let them enter the city What the Prime Minister said is true. Move and catch tigers, do the search. But only 100 of them were allowed to enter the capital Your Honour To determine the force, it takes three days ... Have the search team leader enter the palace. Need large scale search Is it enough to use 100 people? It must be impossible, 100 people found that monster. Just make sure, you want personal support. Expanded search team. What do you think? During the transplant, they were called to do a match. How to make up for that pain After saying that, If people participate in search independently, It must be able to calm rumors. OK. But prioritize their safety. Command of the king! Subject to listen to this. A strange thing happened on Mount. Threatening the security of our country Because of that, troops sought to trace Mount. Don't sir. Do not. Sir, this is only food until the end of fall. If you take all this, how can we live? Just give it all. If you have a strange disease, Then our whole family will die If you don't have money, join in. Why is it noisy? Follow me. - Sir - Don't sir, no. It's better to just kill me now. Do you die here or die there. Sooner or later, I'm dead too. Can those like this catch the monster, brother? What else is the child? Hey. Why are you here too? I'm the only man at home. How much food is available later if we join. Just your food karma come here? Give him one and take the rice ball. There, go home. Go home, go home and eat this. Go home and help this grandfather to go home. Go, hurry Old man, you can go home. Sir, I used to raise a lot of animals. This search is very difficult, it's okay? I will not trouble you. How come this world is like this. I don't know either. Why did he come here? You found out. I saw you I said, Myeong. Shut up, noisy. Why did you get here? Father! Do you think this is a joke? Go home quickly. Don't worry, I'm more useful than a timid guy ... Where did the clean towel come from? At the host guard's house. - Mr. slaughterer ... - What? Oh, no. Miss yourself ... - What? - Why is your face red? I? I said go home quickly. The leader forces have come. You're still alive. Your life is very long, not mere talk. Speed ​​up the journey. If all people's assistance also fails, His Majesty will definitely be angry with him. This time don't run again. Search troops begin. Give a quick step. Speed ​​up the journey. If you find traces or body fluids, you have to report as soon as possible. Old man. Come on, come here quickly. If you don't want to be caught by that monster? The sun will set. Today's search will end. It seems like everyone is tired too. He said the monster often appeared at night. I think it's better to keep looking. Oh, I don't see anything. Is it available? Stop it Are you scared? Who is afraid. You're still a coward. ... then find, ah, find, find Then ... Father ... Until the trip here. Even ordinary dice are not visible I think it's a little weird. Let's start looking again. I suggest troops search I will come here. You are responsible for the left side. If you find something strange, I will fire a flare I just... Afraid some of them cannot return, that's my worry. After that monster is confirmed there isn't, Only that broke the main problem of my people. For the sake of rebuilding the country's security from being dangerous. Does His Majesty still assume that monster, I made it up? In the Prime Minister's mind, who knows? I only believe in them. Is the old man crazy? Old man. Where is this, I'm confused. Where did the old man leave? What is this? Father... Have I been here before? General, please look at this for a moment. Never seen a trace of that size All footprints are in the lower direction. I have to go down to know that. - Prepare the rope - yes. Weapons are in their hands Why let us lead? Quick, fast way. There are no people Kill everything without leftovers. What happened? Is it because we can't catch it? They're all killers of a thousand knives. I should have guessed when I joined this search force. Watch Out You go quickly to the Prime Minister's residence. -Yes! Launch the flare signal. Sign of a monster. Father... Pull, pull. Father... Brother What happened? Brother quickly rose. Father... Very helpful Are you okay, Myeong, no one is hurt? I am fine. Here, let us take care. You go with Myeong, hurry up. Report this to His Majesty Yes. That's a good thing, This time the chance to give Jin Yong a lesson is a bitch. Oh my waist Sung Han, Sung Han, you're okay ... Jin Yong, that bastard. Secretly hunting for a good day Embarrassingly appeared in front of me. Dad, Dad... Myeong. - father - Myeong ... Myeong. Since the beginning the monster never existed. To introduce the army to the capital, the Prime Minister planned a coup. Why are you doing me? Why are you doing this? Underestimating His Majesty's purpose Disparaging the lives of the people Do you think you can survive? Still trusting people? They only believe what they want to believe. Have you forgotten the incident 13 years ago? Stop, shut up, damn bastard. Do you remember now? I knew from the beginning. Father... Myeong Fuck you You will die in my hand. I will not let it escape. Ladies. Miss, wake up. Be aware, miss. Quiet. Calm down Calm down, calm down Brother ... Launch a flare, so the Prime Minister knows. The monster appeared to kill all search forces. Yes.

They call 'Jojung Bang'. - Jojung Bang: adjustment cage In the depths of this cage, made based on crossing with various animals. and is a very valuable asset. If the animal is known to be valuable and full of violence, will cross the Ming Dynasty. He was taken west here, And I am responsible for feeding animals in this place. This is where I meet small monsters. Two beautiful eyes that look shining. So I named it Chorong. The day when Yanshan was abandoned Soldiers make a mess of it to this place.
