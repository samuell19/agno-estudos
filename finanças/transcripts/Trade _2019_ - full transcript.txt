[jazzy hiphop instrumental music] - Cherry, it's gonna be slow as fuck tonight. And this sucks, cause I need like $200 for real. - Bitch, you always need coin for real. Busy or slow night, it don't matter. Who are you foolin'? - Oh my God. [laughs] You right. A bitch be about her coins. - Here. Shut up and get your life together. - God. - You're gonna be top bitch tonight. - Thank you. [jazzy hiphop instrumental music] I'm glad to see you reconsidered my offer, sugar. - Yeah, I took a minute to decide exactly what I wanted. - Mm, and what's that, sugar? - The perfect blowjob. - Oh, that can be arranged. It's gonna cost you 50 bucks. A hundred if you want it Jimmy free. - Good morning. - Hey. - Thanks, babe. - Hey, listen. We have that appointment with Dr. Ansley next Tuesday. So make sure Melody has your schedule booked out from one to three. - I did, I made sure she already blocked it out. - Good. I think this doctor's really gonna help us. I mean, he's so genuine and up to date on all the latest advancements, and all the reviews I've read have been so glowing. - Yeah, that's great. - Michael. I'm serious. This is important to me, to us, and we've already talked about it and decided this is the best approach. I need you to be on board. - Babe. I'm 100% on board. You're gonna get everything out of me that you need. And I do mean everything. [beeping] - Hey, Ms. Kaydence. I see you ain't going to school today. - Nope, I'm sick today. - Oh, you sick? What you sick with? - A stuffy nose. [stuffily inhales] - Is that right? A stuffy nose? - [Kaydence] Yup. - How much? - Good morning to you, Shawn. Good morning, Aunt Chelle. How was your night, Shawn? Oh it was nice and steady, Aunt Chelle. - The hell with the pleasantries. I want to know the facts. Mhm. So, what you got planned for today? I got some hustle errands to run. - Her butt need to be in school, that's where she need to be. I don't know why you let her get away with this "I got a stuffy nose" all the time. Girl, you ain't sick. - Oh, yes I am. - That girl is sick in the head. That's what she is. Her ass so nosy, she just want to be all up in my ass all day. - That's why her butt need to be in school. Don't put that on her, you the adult. - You right. I am the adult. And as the adult, I pay the rent in this motherfucker. And as the adult, I teach you how to make that money without you stressin'. - How bout I go take my shower, and wash my ass. This good ass that just got you all that cash that you got in your big ol' titties, to go take care of whatever business you gotta go do. That's what I'm gon' go do. [laughing] - You shut your ass up, little girl. Or I'mma drop your ass off up at the school. - Hi. Michael Lewis. I'm the managing partner here, and I'm very excited to meet you. One of the things our firm prides itself on is the personal touch, and the relationships that we build with our clients. Our history speaks for itself. Our motto is, one client at a time. We consider you friends, and family. We focus on the personal touch. - I see that. The view's amazing. It's not your typical law firm. - Nothing is typical about us. In 2016, we managed a portfolio of over 750 million dollars in securities. Each and every one of our clients saw a gain of at least five percent per quarter, ensuring a complete positive growth for the fiscal year. We litigated, and made sure that any discrepancies were handled with a 95% positive outcome. - One of the main reasons we left the last firm was because I feel I shouldn't have to get a call back, and I shouldn't have to wait longer than an hour for a reply. Especially when the firm is handling our hundred million dollar portfolio. You know, personal details are a must for me and my business. - And we take pride in assuring that our conservative nature blends with our conservative approach. We cherish the phrase "attorney-client privilege". - Which is why we are a perfect fit. Personal touch is what we do. It's what motivates us. And this firm has been rated number one in client satisfaction for the last five consecutive years. - Oh, that's what made us take notice. We heard good things about you from one of our clients. He spoke highly of you. - Thank you. I take a lot of pride in my reputation. The goal is if is somebody says my name, they say it with a smile. - And smile they do. [somber acoustic music] - Let me get this straight. You telling me that you needed to run my information for what? Suspicious activity? - [Cop] Exactly. - And this suspicious activity was what, you said? Loitering? Now please explain to me how me walking to the store to purchase some damn cigarettes and some fucking Hot Tamales that I legally paid for with my own cash, is loitering? - Hey, is there anything I can help you with? - You asking me if I need some help? No, no, no, no. Help is what this man standing right here needs. He needs help explaining to me why a black man can't walk to the store to get some damn cigarettes and some fuckin' Hot Tamales. Why he can't walk in peace? Why he gotta be harassed? What, he got a problem with a black man? He mad at me cause I'm black, or he mad because I'm gay? Like damn, I'm fucked either way with you. - Have a good night. - Classic. Bullshit. - [Michael] You okay? - Yeah. Shit. Yeah, I'm good. This shit ain't new. It's part of the deal. Fuck him. Who the fuck is you anyway? - I just saw something that didn't look right. I was concerned, I thought I'd come over and offer you some help. - You gon' help me? You gon' help me stop being a black man? How you gonna help? - No, that's not what I meant. I meant it's my duty as a lawyer to make sure that citizens are treated fairly. - A lawyer. Yeah, okay. - You live around here? You secure for a ride? - Secure? Yeah, you a damn lawyer alright with these big old polite words. Yeah, I'm good. I got here easy, I can get back. - [Michael] Alright, well listen, it's no trouble. I'm heading east. - Sure. Fuck it. I live over by the wash, so you can take me home. - Great. That's the way I'm going, come on. - [Shawn] Nice ride you got here. - Thanks. So, does this happen a lot? - What? Getting cute white men to take me home? - No. The cops. And yes. - Being a black man in America is a reality that will never be justified. So you can imagine being a gay black man. - [Michael] Do you think he harassed you because you're gay? Why would he even suspect that it's because you're gay? - Exactly. Guess his gaydar was on. But I know the drill. The look. The eye contact, the blinking. In the world I live in, I can tell when they want to walk across the other side of the street. And he just wanted to take his frustrations out on a black guy. Double edged sword for me. - That has to suck. - Yup. What kind of lawyer are you anyway? Gotta be a nice one to have a ride like this. - I'm a corporate transaction analysis lawyer. - There you go with them big words again. - How long you lived around here? - I lived here pretty much my entire life. But I moved around a lot since my teenager years. - How about work? Where do you work? - Wherever I can to make money. - And how do you make money? - I'm right here. And I make my money the best way that I know how. [jazzy hiphop instrumental music] Hey, I really appreciate the ride. It's nice to know that there's still some good people out in the world. - It's not a problem. Here. In case you need anything. If you want to talk, if you need some legal help. - Legal problems. My corporate transactions I have lined up? Yeah, honey. Okay. - Oh, thank you honey. Hey. You'll never guess who called me today with some good news. - Who? - Lori. She's five weeks pregnant. - No way, that's crazy. - Yes. And she's pregnant naturally. Michael, she's like two years older than me. We were so excited, we were screaming like teenage girls. Like, planning parties, birthdays, vacations. Can you imagine if they have a boy and we have a girl? Or vice versa? They could get married. [laughing] Whoa, Nelly. You're gonna have to slow down a little bit. You're glowing with so much excitement, I'm afraid you might explode or something. - I'm just saying, you know, it would be great if we had ours like a year later. I'm telling you. This is a good sign. [laughing] - Okay. Well, I'm gonna go upstairs and take a shower, alright? - Wait 'til I'm done, and I'll come join you. - Why don't you just keep doing what you're doing, alright? I had a really long day. I just want to relax and decompress. - Are you sure? Because all this baby talk has me very, very wet. - You save that for me, okay? Let it marinate. [melancholic music] So, does this happen a lot? - [Shawn] What? Getting cute white men to take me home? - Are you serious? - What? [melancholic music] [intense ambient music] So, what exactly is it that you do? I mean, I remember you mentioning graveyard work. That's gotta be tough. I remember pulling those shifts when I was in law school. - Hm. What do I do? How do I put this in the most politically correct response. I offer services to those needing servicing. - Wow. Well, that must be an interesting service. - It can be. Don't get me wrong, it's just temporary. - How long you been doing it? - Ever since I realized I had the gift. - Doesn't sound very temporary to me. - Well, it's sort of hard to get real work when you have a felony record. - Oh, you have a record. - Yeah. Unfortunately. It's not something I'm proud of, but shit happens. - What did you do? If you don't mind my asking. - Nah, I ain't ashamed of it. Let's see. First, got caught up in the system because of credit card fraud, and identity theft. And before you know it, I was wild, rowdy, drugs, robbery, you name it, I was in it. Here I am now. Working under the table, just to make sure I can survive. It's the price of my sins. No regrets, no regrets. - That's a good attitude to have. I admire that. - Yeah. Well, what's your story? I see you're married. - Yeah, yeah. Nine years. - Never understood how guys could hide something like that so easily. I couldn't do it. - You just do. I guess when you're so used to hiding it all the time, you get used to it. I've tried to go to the bars, they're too personal. I can't afford to be outed. And I can't end up in some romance that I can't control. - I have someone that I think you should meet. They may be able to help you with that. [door creaks] - Hey, Kay-D lady. I see you're dressed for school, and yet school started an hour ago. - I was sick, but I feel better now. - Oh, you were sick and now you feel better. It must be a miracle. - Yep. Who's that? - That's my friend Michael. - Does he work with you? - No. He's just my friend. - [laughs] Hi. What's your name? - I'm Kaydence, I'm eight. When I grow up, I want to be an artist. - An artist. What kind? - I don't know, any kind. - Well, good for you. - Shawn. Make sure you pick her up today. I got things to do after work, and I can't get her in time. Who's this? - Damn, girl. Good morning, hello, how you doing? Like, we really need to work on your morning manners. - Fuck you and your manners. Who you got up in my house this early? Now, I know you ain't brought your work home. - Girl, this just my friend Michael. Michael, this my crazy Aunt Chelle. - Pleasure to meet you. - Mhm. You look like you're rich, Mr. Michael. Got that fresh money smell this morning. What you do for a living? - He do none of your business, Aunt Chelle. He here for me, don't worry about our business. - Shoot, I need to know who be up in my house. - I'm a lawyer. - Now that's what I'm talking about. Go on with your bad self. [chuckles] Kaydence, get your bags so we can go. - I see she on her own schedule when it comes to school. - Oh yeah, she tried to pull that sick card today, but it didn't work. Child, remember what I said. Make sure you're here when she gets dropped off today from the bus, and you know what I mean when I say you are here. - Bye, Aunt Chelle. - [Kaydence] Bye, Mr. Michael. - Bye, Kaydence. It was nice to meet you, have a good day, okay? - Follow me. I want to show you something. So now get comfortable. I have someone I want you to meet. [romantic piano music] Hi, Michael. - Hello. [romantic piano music] - Relax. Let me help you find that touch you've been wanting. Explosion. Insanity. [romantic piano music] - It's funny. I haven't felt a release like that in years. - Well, thank you. I take pride in my skills. - So is this the real you? Is this who you really are? - It's who I wish I could be. I wish I could live my life as Coco, but as I'm sure you can already see, it's not that easy. It's bad enough I have to deal with being a gay black man. People close to me can handle that. But when I dress as the real me, that's when the uncomfortableness kicks in, and it's hard to get to where I want to be. You know, the media may act like it's okay to be transgender these days, but it's not. We still get shit for it. - I can imagine. - There was never any doubt within myself that I was different. I was never afraid of that. And I was never that little nigga that got picked on, or called faggot, or whatever. Niggas just knew that I was different. What was classic was the dudes that was trying to act the hardest in front of everybody was the ones that was sneaking with me back in the alley, kissing and sucking and shit. [laughing] Just classic. - When I was growing up, there was this little boy who lived next door, and we would kiss and fondle each other when he would come over and play outside. I didn't think anything about it. It was just something we did. My mom, my mom, she did everything she could to try to make this disease she thought I had go away. Prayer, counseling. These deep sessions. You name it, she had me there. And I just played the role. Just went along with it, cause it sure made her happy. When did you know you were a woman? - To be honest, it wasn't something that I ever thought that I was gonna be. I was okay with just being Shawn. Shawn who liked the boys. And in my teenage years, I mean, I was always comfortable with my feminine ways. I mean, it wasn't no surprise. I liked women's clothing, wore makeup, always made sure my hair was always nice and fly. And then when I hit the cells, I got caught up in the system. I was unfortunately blessed with a cellmate that made me realize, if you want to call it realize, that I needed to dress up. - He raped you? - Rape is such a strong word. And I liked men, and I'm locked up with so many men who regardless of if they're straight, they just really want to get their dick sucked or feel some form of penetration. You know? And here I am with this cellmate who was much older than me, he was a lifer, and so his whole mode and process was that of a hardened criminal. And here I am, this 19 year old wild, gay boy just throw into a pit. And he knew that he could manhandle me at every angle. It went from every morning blowjobs to him fucking me all day. And there's nights I didn't even leave the cell, cause he wanted to nut all day. And after a while, it's just easier to feel like a woman, want to be like a woman. It wasn't something that I ever planned. But if you want to say that I was raped into becoming a woman, than yeah. And I took it. And I understood it while it was happening. And I wasn't inside of there crying and ashamed of my gayness, it wasn't no secret. Hell, when I stabbed that Mexican on the yard in front of everybody that one day, oh, they knew I wasn't just no typical tgirl up in there. I was Candy. That's what they used to call me on the yard. I was Candy, that would cut your neck. - I can't imagine how you overcame that. - No need to overcome it. Probably just needed to happen that way. - Is it difficult? To live your life as Shawn and Coco? How do you do that? - I just do. I mean, I've been in the street living, and on the block every night, hooker hotels, and smoked out, and in and out of the cells, and after a while, all that shit just got old, you know? I realize that I am who I am. Took my last stint in the pen to realize that I have to live my day to day life as Shawn. It's easier. But I go make my money as Coco. It's the only real way to survive. But I got plans. This ain't no career. - And how does Coco make her money? - Coco is on that block, and turning tricks when and wherever I can. It's good money. Police is cracking down on that street hustle. But the internet done changed the game. I gotta hustle from here to there every day just to make ends meet. Standing on the block ain't what it used to be. I mean, don't get me wrong, there's still some good money out there, but it ain't like it used to be 10 years ago. It seem like only the real hustlers is out there now. [lighthearted music] Okay. Next word is fountain. I'm gonna drink some water from the fountain. - Next. - Alright. Next word is together. We can make the cake together tonight. You little Twinkie head. - Aw yeah. - Ah. Hey Kay lady. How was school today? - [Kaydence] It was good. - And Shawn? How was you doing today? - Now you want to know how my day was? - Mhm. - You so nosy. - Well, shit. You gon' have George Bush in your ass before I leave outta here. I gotta hear that info. - Oh, so you got jokes. No, he just somebody that's new to the world. - Did you turn him out? - I just helped him turn his light on. You already know how I get down. I ain't trying to build nobody. I need you already built, and ready to go. - Well, don't lie. You don't have to kick it like that. I can see it in your face. I know you're into something else. This mofo is a lawyer, and he got the cheese. And you better make sure you a rat, and gon' eat it. - Everybody ain't a hustle, Aunt Chelle. - Bitch... Everything is a hustle. I mean you think just cause I got these scrubs on, ain't a hustle? You think you staying here ain't a hustle? You better get your mind right. - Next word is forever. I am forever tired of hearing your Nanny's mouth. [Kaydence chuckles] No, I just think I made a good friend who needed some pushing in the right direction. - Well, you better be careful. See it's one thing dealing with them fools who's all up in the trade. And it's another thing when someone who's just curious. What time you leaving tonight? - I plan to head out around eight-ish. - I'm gonna go take a nap, and before you go, make sure Kay-D eats. - Okay. - [Kaydence] Can I get McDonald's? - Sure. - Yes! - Aight, next word. [catchy music] - My son is 13 now. The kid has girls FaceTime him like he's famous. I have to make sure they're not doing any of that funny stuff on those chats. These girls these days are bold. - Can you imagine if we had cell phones back in the day? - In my day, you had to be a master conversationalist just to get the girl on the phone to have phone sex. It took so much prodding and convincing just to get her to put the phone next to her pussy so you could hear it. Now these jokers can actually sit there and watch it. - It's a whole new world when it comes to pleasure. - Can you believe my wife still won't let me film her giving me a BJ? I'm like babe, nobody's gonna see this but us. And still, she won't budge. - Mm, that's so wack. - Tell me about it. So, let's talk business. How does 500 sound this time? - Sounds perfect. With an extra 100 for the tip? - Of course. [sirens blaring] [catchy hiphop instrumental music] - I talked to the doctor, and he seems to think the insertion method is gonna be the best one for us. - Insertion method? - Yeah, he has like 90% success rate with it. And he said with our age, and our schedules, we could probably get pregnant between 90 and 120 days. - Oh, I mean, I kinda wanted to go about it the old fashioned way, and see which little swimmer won the prize. - But, Michael, we've tried the old fashioned way, and for some reason, those little swimmers don't want to take the prize. - Ashley, it seems so fake. It seems like we're forcing a child in this world that isn't ready, and I want us to welcome a child that wants to be here. - Well, I'm tired of waiting. And I'm ready to meet him or her. You know, and science is there to help speed up this process. So are you with me or not? - Well, after that comment, I feel like you're going to do it whether I am in or not. - Michael. I'm serious. I've always supported you, and I've given you everything. This is what I want, this is what we want. And I've never hidden the fact that I wanted to be a mother from you, so please don't do that. - Ashley. Baby, I get it. I understand that you want to be a mother. I'm not trying to be the bad guy here. I just never envisioned a scenario where I would have to go see some doctor and jizz in a cup. - That's not fair. It's not like we haven't tried the natural way. You know, sometimes nature just needs a little help. - Okay. Tell me what you need. - Great. Okay, well, okay, I'm gonna make an appointment for you, and you'll go give a sample. - So fun. - And let him work his magic. And if you need help getting that sample, I can be there too. Michael, this is gonna be amazing. Can you imagine having another little Michael around? - Oh, baby, we are not cursing a child with my name. - Or maybe she's gonna be a little girl with big blue eyes and blonde hair. Hey. Why don't we go in and try the natural way right now? - Ashley, baby. I've got a ton of work to do, I have to finish a brief, I got behind last week. - Fine. Then I'll go use my friend. You're not the only one who likes to pleasure themselves. - Ouch. [chuckling] You're just trying to make me jealous. [waves crashing] [relaxing instrumental music] - Hey there, Mr. Michael. - Hi. I didn't know I was having drinks with Coco, I would've been prepared. - Baby, you should always be prepared. - I'll have to keep that in mind. - Let me explain something to you. In the simplest way. I don't have time for no bullshit. - Understood. - You playing this lost puppy, new virgin thing, it's not required. I deal with this shit every day. - Was I that obvious? - It's not about being obvious. It's about respect. - Understood. I wasn't trying to be disrespectful. - No, I get it. You have to play the role for your wife and your friends. Can't afford to be seen in your true self. - No. That's not it. I've always known I've liked men. It never was an uncertainty with me. - Then why live a lie? - I don't know. I got really caught up in how life's supposed to be. And then I met Ashley, and it was just easier to play the role to get where I needed to go. And here we are, 10 years later, and I'm still playing the role to get where I need to go. - Playing the role is only making it worse. - I found a way to manage. But meeting you is different. All the other men I've been with, they were in similar situations as mine. They needed a discretion, like I did. So I was just in and out. But you... Something felt different. - Man, don't bullshit a hustler. Do you think I'm dumb enough to think that I'm the first gay man you've ever talked to? Stall that shit. - No, no. But you're the first one who's real about their other world. You're the first one that is experiencing life as a woman and getting to live out those same fantasies. I tell you what. How about you take another ride with me. - Is this your other home? - Something like that. You make yourself comfortable, and I will be right back. [catchy instrumental music] - Oh, okay then. Okay. Okay. So, who is this? - Hello, Shawn. It's nice to meet you. My name is Honey. - Mm, Honey. You're full of all kinds of surprises there, Ms. Honey. Not bad. It's not bad. So is this the you that you want to be? - This is me. This is what I look like when I want to feel good. And you're the first person to see me like this. - Okay. Okay, well I guess I should feel honored. Why are you showing me the real you? - I want to take this me into the real world. And I believe you're the perfect person to show me that world. - [chuckles] Wait a minute. When you say the real world, what world? You trying to walk the block? You trippin'. You trippin', you are not ready for that world. It ain't no just let's go hang spot. I mean, you gotta know the rules. - Teach me. I just want to be free, to be me for once. For someone to see me as me. And to pleasure me that way. - Girl, you are crazy. - I want the real experience. I want to see and do what you do, I want to walk that fine line between being real and being sexy. - Okay. Okay. Want to hit this? Just hold the pipe. There we go, watch your fingers. Go slow, go slow. Alright. Alright. First lesson. [catchy instrumental music] Alright. There ain't no playbook to this shit. You're either about it, or you not. And you listen to me. And only anybody that I tell you to listen to. These bitches out here is real salty, and they'll have you turned up in a dumpster somewhere, okay? - Okay. - Alright. And all good dick ain't good dick. And just because somebody pull up and want to party with you, and want to take you on a ride, don't mean you gotta jump in there and go. Peep the scene. Cops love to bust us when they bored. Alright? - Yes. - Remember. Put your hand on the thigh next to the balls when you go in for the kiss. Now if he jump back real quick, then you jump your ass out that car, because ain't no cop gonna let you kiss all up on him and kiss and touch up on his dick. Now, you got this? - Yes. - Alright. Bout to jump in the deep end, I hope your hoe ass is ready to swim. [catchy acoustic music] See, I told you those cops be trippin'. - I see you, Coco. - Hey, Ms. Cherry. This is Honey. - Hi. - This the new bitch you're putting on the block that you was talking about? - Absolutely. - Oh. These motherfuckers are gonna be for reals up on this white bitch here. You're so unclockable it ain't even funny. I hope you like 10 inches all up in you, girl. - Be nice. - You hustle before? - No. - Bitch. So you saying this is your first time? Ooh, we got a virgin up in these streets. We're gonna give you the first treat tonight. Let you pop it right away. [catchy acoustic music] Hi. This is Honey. She's gonna take real good care of you. Give you everything you need. - Hi, honey. - [Man] How much? - [Michael] What are you looking for tonight, honey? - I want a BJ. Maybe even a little tugging action. - Mm. That's gonna cost you a hundred. [catchy acoustic music] - [Shawn] Let's hope my pussy don't come out. - Holy shit, that was such a rush. Just the excitement, the readiness of it all. I see why you do it. [chuckles] - Don't get it twisted. This ain't no party train. You're just on one right now, and it's still all in your head. You get to doing this like me, on the regular, you'll get tired of it. - I can see that. Sometimes I get so good at pretending, that I believe it myself. I believe that I actually want to have kids, and a family, and all that shit. But in my heart, I know I really don't. But sometimes it's easier to pretend, and be able to keep my true essence. But tonight... Tonight... Tonight was something so magical that I wanted for such a long time. I got to be truly liked, and desired as the real me. - What's crazy is you didn't even flinch. You walked right out there like you've been practicing and preparing for it. - Well, maybe I have. This room. This suite was my only outlet. In here I can talk it, I can walk it, I can sauce it up, I can stand in that mirror and stroke it if I want to. Do whatever I want to please me. I never even thought to bring a man in here. [chuckles] It took going out to the boulevard to do that. - Go hard or go home. Just don't get too comfortable on this. It ain't you. - This is me. This is me. - Bitch, I'm talking about these streets. Shit ain't you. Yeah, I brought you out here so you can get a taste. But it ain't you. You want to keep a fantasy world? Keep it here, in this room. Motherfuckers will come here, they'll fuck you down, you don't gotta be on that boulevard. That's my world, that's not your world. You want to have your fun this weekend? Get you some freaks, some tricks to run all up and through here, it's cool. But come Monday morning, you have your little white ass back at that office doing that lawyer shit. Go home to your wife. This shit here, psh, this shit ain't you. - Hi, honey. - We getting a room? - No baby, you're gonna keep it in park, and I'm gonna take care of you right here. I like a little car action. - Okay. Me too. - You nervous? Don't worry about it, baby, I'm new to this too. - You are? How new? - This week. So just relax. What are you looking for? - What can I get? - Baby, you can get whatever you want. You want me to touch it, you want me to touch yours, you want to suck it, you want me inside of you, whatever you want, I'm down for it. - Can you suck and I'll play ring action on you? - Sure. - Okay. - Okay, need to see that money first. - Oh, yeah. - There we go. Let me see what you got. Alright. - [Man] No, no! - Stop it! Get off me! Fucker! Jesus fuck! [Michael sobs] - What the fuck? Girl. Oh my God. See, this is why I hate that internet shit. These motherfuckers act like they ain't got no motherfucking sense. Here, put this on your face. And take this wig off. - Oh, thank you, ow. Aw. - Sorry. Girl. You white folks bruise up fast. - Thank you. - No problem. You see? This life isn't as fun as it looks. So, Coco tells me you're a lawyer. Married, rich and all that. - I wouldn't say rich. [laughing] - Bitch. You drive a rich man's car, and you ain't living in an apartment like this. You rich. - [Michael] Fine, maybe I'm "okay" then. - Yeah, you're "okay" then. So, why you gotta be tricking for money? Why you gotta be tricking for ass? This life is for bitches who ain't got no other options for money. Do you know how many jobs I had when I tried to convince myself that I don't need to be tricking for money? 55. I have had 55 bullshit jobs. Did I tell you I was in the Navy when I was 19? Yeah. I did my time in the military. But that whole don't ask, don't tell shit is bullshit. Everyone knew I was a flaming fag. [laughing] I mean, can't hide it. But I was no punk. I could outrun them fools, out jump, out shoot. But do you think they were okay with me being me? Negative. And somehow, I found myself dishonorably discharged. Even though I was one hell of a soldier. So that whole thing with the military being cool with trans people? Don't believe it. And every job since then, I was either fired or let go of because some asshole didn't like the way I wore my makeup, or the way I moved my hips. Plus, I got tired of making $12 an hour. Can't nobody live off of $12 an hour. - So is this how you make your money? - Honey. I make my money any way that I can. The block, trade shows, video, hustle, internet. You name it, I go get it. - Trade shows. - Girl, I should take you to a show. It's that classy hustle. You would be the talk of the night. Cause you're fresh, and new, and well, you ain't saucy. - Saucy? - Yeah. Your shit clean. You ain't got the virus. You ain't gotta worry about no 25 to life. [phone rings] - [Michael] I gotta get this. - Yeah, you better. - Hi, honey. - [Ashley] Hey, babe. You having a good time? - That's one way to put it. - Yeah, I got into a little skirmish on the golf course. I guess don't drink and drive goes for golf too. - [Ashley] What? Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. I just have a little accident on my face. The golf cart definitely won, but I got my licks in. - [Ashley] Oh, honey. I'm so sorry. Shoot, I might like the boxer look on you. Sounds sexy. - Yeah, well, tequila and golf definitely don't go together. How's your weekend? - [Ashley] These women are gonna drive me crazy. I can't even begin to explain my level of frustrations. - I can imagine. - [Ashley] Honey, I'll let you go and get some rest. You sound beat. I'll see you tomorrow. Love you. - [Michael] I love you too. - You got your game down packed. Classic. - You have no idea. - Oh. Looks like you made a career change. I kind of like the fighter look on you. - I bet you do. [laughs] - I hope you got your actual business handled. - I did. It was a very effective weekend. - Good. Why don't you go get cleaned up and showered and we can grab some lunch. Sushi sound okay? - Yeah. - Okay. - Is this all you have? - [Michael] Yeah. - Okay. [melancholic music] - Now, look, Honey. This is the classy shit. These motherfuckers are already here for the trade, and you just gotta play the game. I know you think you're a pro now. - I think I'll be okay. [smooth instrumental music] - Ms. Cherry. Who is this beauty we have here tonight? - This is Honey. She's sweet. - Honey. Welcome to my home, take a look around. Whatever you want, it's yours. - Thanks. [smooth calming music] - Excuse me one minute. I have to admit, I'm impressed. - Excuse me? - You know, at first, I wasn't sure I was seeing what I thought I was seeing. But you know, it's amazing how you literally transform into something beautiful. I mean it, Michael. Like, you make a beautiful woman. And as for the detail that you put in your work, you also put it in your personal life. - You can't tell anyone at the firm about this. This is the first time I've done this. - Oh, trust me. I won't say a word. You think anybody at my group would like to know that I love the trade shows? I don't think so. [Michael chuckles] I mean, the fact that I'm worth a hundred million dollars, who really gives a shit what they think, but I'm just in awe of how gorgeous you are. - Thank you. - I always had a little crush on you. When you were dressed as Michael, you know? But seeing you as this, as... What's your name? - Honey. - Yes, Honey. Seeing you as Honey has turned from a little boy crush into a full blown college kid hard on. - Excuse me. I need her for a minute. What the hell are you doing here, Michael? - What the hell do you think I'm doing here, Shawn? - No, motherfucker. I'm here because this is how I make my living. This shit here ain't no block. These parties is for bitches just like me who really do this shit. This is real life shit. This shit here is that social media shit. You trying to be all over the damn internet? These fuckers up in here are legit fuckers. They fuckers just like you, with money, and a wife at home, but they just be craving the dick. You about to get yourself caught up, up in here. - I know where I am, thank you. And I don't need an ethics class from you. - You think I'm playing, bitch. Now you wanted a taste of the fast lane, and I helped you get that out of your system. But this shit ain't for you. You about to lose all you got, and for what? Some fast dick? Like seriously. Go home to your wife, Michael. - I'm a grown ass man. Woman. Whatever the fuck I want to be. Now I don't need your permission to figure out how I exist in this world. Now I thank you for helping me figure out this part of myself, but I don't need your permission to be me. So let me tell you something, Shawn. Unless you have something positive to say, why don't you trot your happy ass away from me, and I'm gonna go back inside, and possibly fuck the man who just gave me law firm 15 million dollars to manage their account. And let me tell you something else. I'm gonna get every dollar out of my time with him. - You know what, bitch? You go right ahead. [knocking] - Before you open your mouth, be very smart about what comes out of it. - How did you know I was here? - Michael, I've always known about your second home. I was fine with it, no big deal. Felt like you probably needed the extra space considering all the stress you take on. Hell, I even thought you might have a hooker or two every night and then. - Okay. Why are you here then? - Well, I decided to come tonight because the thought occurred to me that, no, not that my husband might be gay, which by the way, I always suspected, but, no, my husband wants to be a woman. He doesn't want to penetrate another man's ass, he wants it in his ass. - Ashley, I-- - Stop talking! Could I have handled this maybe you're gay, maybe you're not, years ago? Yeah. And I did. I accepted it. You think I've never noticed how you act when other men are around? You think a woman who's been fucking you since she was 19 years old wouldn't notice? You think I didn't know about the whole pray the gay away intervention shit your mom made you do? I did. I knew. And I accepted it, because I love you. I love you for you, and you being you for me. But this whole fantasy, role play crap, it's not you. I mean, I get you growing up with a single mother, and not having a role model, and the need to always be so perfect and clean. But this is just wrong. Then you go on some pretend business trip, and you come back with a busted face. Respect me, Michael. Respect yourself! What is it? You want to be the bitch? You want your face slapped? You want your hair pulled? Is that what it is? - Yes. This is me. It always has been. - No. I don't accept that. I think it's just you being bored. Just fighting the reality that we need to advance our family, our future. Our relationship. I get that you're scared, Michael. I'm scared too. But this, whatever this is inside of you, it's gotta stop. So you need to end this shit. - Ashley. You have to understand! There's part of me that feels good this way. I feel brave, I feel strong. I feel sexy. - And you were all those things, Michael, as a man. A man with a fucking dick. So get over yourself. And whatever this is you have inside of you, fix it. Because I never want to have this conversation again. It's embarrassing. I'll see you at the house. [Michael sobs] [somber music] - [Michael] Ashley. - Remember, you need to be at the clinic 30 minutes early, to fill out some paperwork before your test. - [Michael] You don't want to discuss what just happened? - And make sure you give enough, you don't want to have to go back. - [Michael] Ashley. We have to have a conversation about what just happened. - Michael. I said what I needed to say, and you did what you needed to do. We don't need to discuss or decide anything from last night. Have a busy day. I'll see you this evening. [somber music] - [Nurse] Are you currently taking any medications, Michael? - No. - [Nurse] Any preexisting medical conditions that need to be addressed? - No. - [Nurse] Are you sexually active? - Sexually active? - Yes, as in currently engaging in any sexual intercourse? - Yes. - You use protection? - [Michael] Yes. - Are you engaging in any homosexual activity? - No. [dramatic music] - Michael. Sid's in your office waiting for you. - He is? Okay. Sid. I didn't know we had a meeting this morning. I would've been here sooner. - Sit down, Michael. - What seems to be the problem, Sid? You're not worried about the Gelp Group, are you? I've got it under control. [Sid laughs] - Do ya? You sure about that? - What's that? - This is you having it under control. - Sid, I can explain. - No need. Jonathan explained it enough to anybody who could hear and understand. - Sid-- - You know, Michael, I could care less about anybody's sexuality. I mean, my brother's gay. You want to dress up as a woman in your spare time, in the privacy of your own home, do what you want to do. It's none of my business. But this, doing these freak show sex parties... What were you thinking, Michael? I mean really, what were you thinking? Because Mr. Flynn attends some of these functions, you thought it would be okay if the man who manages his money could be there too, is that it? You see, even if it was you there just as he was, just getting your rocks off, but you weren't. No. Instead, we have pictures of you taking it up at the ass at a God damn freak show! Michael. What am I supposed to do with this, Michael? Hm? How am I supposed to respond to this? You tell me what my reaction, what my response is supposed to be for something like this, tell me. - Sid, if I thought this was gonna affect our clients in any way, I would never have been there. - That's your answer. It's a very good answer, actually. But it's not enough. - What does that mean? - What that means is I'm pulling you off the Geld account. Yeah. I will not have anything that's happening in your personal life interfering with my business. I built this from scratch, and this is what I get? As of now, you're suspended from all duties and responsibilities in this company until I personally assess if you even have a future here. Michael. Go home, Michael. Go see Ashley. [knocking] - Hey. Kaydence, right? How you doing? - Good. - Is Shawn home? - [Chelle] Who at the door, Kay-D? - The white man. - Oh. This white man? You looking for Shawn? - I am. Is he here by chance? - Yeah. Get on in here. Ya'll, this is the mofo we need to be talking to. - I just need to see Shawn. - Okay, in a minute. But me and you need to talk some business. You see, I got this business idea that I've been trying to put together, and I think you are the perfect person to help me get it poppin'. - Stall all that, Aunt Chelle. Ain't nobody trying to hear about your latest hustle. Michael, what are you doing here? - Can we talk somewhere please? - Yeah, let's go out back. What are you doing here, Michael? - You tell me, Shawn. I get to work today and my boss somehow, someway, has pictures of me from that party the other night. - And? - And how the hell does my boss end up with pictures of me from a private party? - Whoever said that that was a private party? Your ass just assumed that because it was at a home, that it was a private party. Well, I got news for you. Them functions ain't private. - I didn't see any photographers there. I didn't see any film crews there. So you tell me how those photographs got there. - First off, I told your stupid ass you didn't need to be there. And you was way in over your head with this fixation on wanting to be a tgirl. Well, here you go. You've officially hit the circuit. You're a tgirl, you're a Trish. - I'll tell you what I am officially. I'm officially off the biggest client at my firm. I'm officially almost certainly out of a job very soon. - Well, you wanted this, Michael. You wanted to be free. Well, this is what freedom feels like. But it doesn't feel so good, does it? It doesn't feel good to realize that your options are limited to what you can do. Welcome to my world. Maybe you should focus on going home and having this conversation with your wife. Well, go on home, Michael. Deal with the real issues. I gotta get back to my real life, I got a hot date, and I got some money to make. [jazzy hiphop instrumental music] - Come on in here. [laughs] Shit, where you been at girl? You got a nigga feelin' like you dodging a nigga. - No, I just been busy. It's nothing like that. - Busy? Too busy to come see your favorite dude? - Nah. - That ain't like you. What's really good? - For reals. I just been busy. Trying to save up enough so I can go to school. - School? What kind of school? Since when you want to become a schoolgirl? Nah. That ain't the Chocolate that I know. - Chocolate is dead. Coco wants a better life, you know? And since Chocolate ruined any chances of me getting a regular job, or receiving any federal student aid, Coco is forced to hustle and stack. - You know, I can't hate on that. Just make sure when I call, that you answer a nigga call. Alright? Cause you know, a nigga get lonely, and be needing that Chocolate, or excuse me, that Coco fix. [laughs] - I know that's right. - You know that nigga Nico got out the other day? - What? He was in there for like four years, right? He went in there after I did. - Yeah. Mhm. Yeah, he was a straight soldier. You know. I didn't think he was gonna hang, but he took his bid like a G. [chuckles] - Yeah. I didn't understand why he got caught up anyway. I didn't realize he was that deep in the game. - Nah, he wasn't that deep. It was just that, you know, he was the one that had to take the hit for the team. Somebody had to do it. And when shit got hot, you know, it gotta be one of the little niggas to take that bid. So we was able to keep that money going. - And what does that mean? - What does that mean? That means that sometimes the little niggas gotta be the one to take that charge. - Take that charge? Nigga, I took a charge. [laughs] - Yup. Yeah, you did. You took that shit like a soldier too. - What you mean I took that like a soldier? You knew I was gonna take that charge? - When your shit got hot, I could not be the one to take that hit. Money was flowing too freely at the time, and debts was too strong. So you doing that time was a much easier bid. You in them streets. The judge ain't gonna look at you the same way he looking at me. - You telling me I did two years cause you wasn't trying to do them years? You telling me I got this jacket, and I'm forced to walk these streets because money was flowing? - Man, relax baby, relax. Them two years flew by. Chill out. [laughs] I mean, you was in there running and handling shit from both ends. That's what I heard. You know, shit, you really took my bid like a motherfucking champ. - Nigga, I took that bid for me, not you. You wasn't in there dealing with that shit. It wasn't nothing good about them niggas passing me around like I wasn't shit. It was nothing good about me turning tricks with them white boys just to satisfy some nigga's debt. And you wasn't getting fucked raw dog just because some nigga was bored. You know, that's fucked up, Cedrick. - Aye, where you going? - [Shawn] I gotta go to the bathroom. - Yeah. You do that. Go ahead, freshen up. Nigga dick tingling from this hit. Ready to let you play with it. - I bet. [dramatic piano music] - Yeah. Ah! Yeah. Oh, I'm ready for this. [dramatic piano music] - I cut this motherfucker's throat. Can you help me? [phone rings] - Dr. Ansley. Hi. I'm so excised, I've been waking up early just to mentally prepare myself for those morning sickness moments. Sure. Sure, I can come in. Okay, thank you. [knocking] - You must be Ashley. - I'd be able to reply who you were if I knew who you were. But it's obvious, you're the man screwing Michael. - My name is Shawn. - What is he, smoking this shit now too? - Maybe we should call Michael. - No. No. What's he gonna say? Ashley, meet my gay black lover. Black lover, meet Ashley, my wife of nine years, who I pretended to love and start a family with, while he's secretly taking it up the ass from this man. No. [chuckles] He doesn't really have anything to say to me at this point. - You know, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. And this is not what I'm about. Michael had his issues long before he came to me, and I just think that I helped him realize they weren't issues, but a reality. - Reality? Do you want to hear my reality? My reality is that I may never have children with this man. This man that I gave 100% of myself to. The same man that went out and wasn't smart enough to wear a condom when he decided to fuck whoever he wanted, whenever he wanted. So now his sperm is tainted, it's useless. God knows what else. And I'm so fucking embarrassed that I can't even go back to the doctor that could give me what I wanted. A baby. So excuse me if I don't see your reality as something Michael needed to do. - And I'm sorry. I'm truly sorry. But I think this is a conversation that you need to have with him. [door slams] [dramatic piano music] - I didn't know you were home. - I remember the day I fell in love with you. We were eating at the park near campus, I'd gotten mad at you because you couldn't come to a party cause you got too drunk with Phil the night before. You made it up to me by picking me up and taking me to the park for a picnic. That was the day I knew you loved me. And you would do anything to make up for your mistake. And I loved you ever since that day. [Michael chuckles] - I remember how mad you were at me. You cursed me out all the way to that park, and then you saw the picnic basket I'd hidden in the trunk. That smile you gave me. That was priceless. - I remember the moment that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you. I remember the thought of wanting to have children with you, start a family, grow old together. Die together. Never did I think that I'd want anything more than to love you, and for you to love me. - I know I let you down. But the reality is I do love you. - I don't doubt that you love me. - I kept this side of myself so deep and so misunderstood for such a long time, I can't hide it anymore. All my life, I tried to protect people at the expense of my own happiness. - Did it ever cross your mind that my happiness might be at stake? Did it ever cross your mind through all the secrets and desires that I want something more? That I need something more? Maybe I need something more than you felt I needed? - I'm so sorry. I wish this wasn't what it is. But I can't do this to you anymore. I won't do this to me anymore. Too many things have happened for me to hide anymore. - I could've handled the confusion, I could understand your desires, and I can tolerate the embarrassment. You want to wear women's clothing? Fine. You want to explore your sexuality? Fine. But you have disrespected my future, my dreams, and my health. And I may never know what it's like to have life growing inside of me. So now I'm thinking wow, the man I love, he doesn't respect me, he doesn't love me, he doesn't even care about me. - Everything I do is to protect you. To protect your honor. I want you to have everything that you need. - No. I can no longer have everything I need. That dream is gone. You've made sure that I'll never be a mother, and you've made sure that I'll never fulfill what I needed from you. That's not an option anymore. - Ashley. I'll always love you. I'll never abandon you, or our child. - Our child. Yeah. Our child. [gun fires] Our child. [gun fires] [jazzy hiphop instrumental music] [somber piano music]
