[MUSIC PLAYING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] Hee-yah! [GRUNTS] ALL: [GRUNTING WHILE FIGHTING] [GLASS SHATTERS] [GRUNTS] You are becoming skilled senshi-- fighter. [APPLAUSE] So why am I the one who always ends up on my back? You still believe that your strengths only rise on your physical abilities. I keep telling you, Sensei. I'm only doing this to stay in shape. Until you realize that the universe is not determined by the physical but how it works in the harmony with your mind and spirits, you will never reach your kanketsu-- completion. Yeah, right. I sense there are many journeys that start in your life, but few are finished. When the paper asks me to do a story on oriental philosophy, I'll be sure to give you a call. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [DOORBELL RINGING] [SIGHS] - Mr. Roberts. - Yeah. Emil Boev. I'm here on behalf of a mutual friend. Dr. Venco. Charlie Venco? Where the hell is he? Bulgaria. Bulgaria? May we? Yeah. Come in. TRANSLATOR: He's doing genetic research in the city of Sofia. Well, that sounds like Charlie. He does like living on the edge. He's on the verge of a breakthrough and wants you to cover it. [CHUCKLES] I do arts and entertainment. He thought you could use a career, make an exclusive. Your career. Understand me? I know Charlie's always looking out for me, but this-- I don't know. No. A press visa's already been issued. A return ticket through London and $5,000 in cash for expenses. Hmm. That's not bad. Funny what life kicks up, no? [LAUGHS] No shit. Well, what do you know? Looks like I'm going to Bulgaria. [AIRPLANE FLYING OVERHEAD] [MUSIC PLAYING] Boyana - Boyana? [BULGARIAN] [ENGINE STARTS] Welcome to Sofia, the city that never sleeps on the new and free democracy. My name is Vasyl. At your service. Where can we take you on this lovely day? To Ahova Street, number 46 in Boyana. Boyana? Where the rich play. Country clubs, villas, embassies, and restaurants. Kind of in a hurry, Vasyl. It will be $25. Includes my special tour. I'll make it 50 if you step on it. Are you staying with a friend? Yeah, best friend since childhood. Well, it's a good thing. Why is that? Because without a friend to guide you, Sofia is a tricky city. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SINGING IN BULGARIAN] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [BELL RINGING SOMBERLY] Who died? [BULGARIAN] [BULGARIAN] The owner. Your friend. You're joking, right? [SINGING IN BULGARIAN] [SOMBER MUSIC] [BELL RINGING SOMBERLY] Excuse me. Can we talk? [BULGARIAN] [CAR STARTS] Bill Phillips. I was Charlie's friend. Steve Roberts. Yeah, I know. I'm sorry to meet you in this circumstance. [BIRDS CHIRPING] You need a ride? Yeah, I do. You're OK? Yeah, I'm fine. What happened? Terrible fishing accident. Right off Varna in the Black Sea. I was there on the boat. Poor Charlie, he hooked a mammoth sturgeon, easily 500 kilos, but it [INAUDIBLE]. The line caught his leg and pull him over. He was hacked to pieces by the propeller. Was a bloody mess. That's why they had a closed casket. - That's unbelievable. - Yeah, I know. He didn't deserve it. He was a good man. I didn't even get to see him. How long had it been? About a year. What were you doing here? Well, I was going to write about his work. Shame. And now? Guess I go home. You're welcome to stay at my place tonight if you want. Thanks. That's kind of you. But I think I'll be better off in a hotel. Can you recommend one? Yeah. [MYSTERIOUS MUSIC] [CHATTER IN BACKGROUND] All set. They'll take care of you. OK, thanks, Bill. Thanks for everything. - OK. Have a good flight back. - Thanks. See ya. Bill. Yeah. One second. Yeah. That girl at the cemetery, the one the cops kept me from. Who was she? Why? Just seemed like she knew me. Oh, don't bother with her. No, I won't. I just want to know what her name is. Alexa Kazan. What was she to Charlie? Well, not much. She's a showgirl. You know Charlie and his women. - Yeah. - Good luck. Thanks a lot. [SOMBER MUSIC] [SIGHS] OPERATOR (ON PHONE): Hello. Operator. OPERATOR (ON PHONE): Can I help you? Yeah, I've trying to get in touch with the States for hours now. What the hell is going on? OPERATOR (ON PHONE): The satellite is down. But you can call the UK if you wish. No, no. No thanks That really doesn't help me. OPERATOR (ON PHONE): Sorry, sir. - OK. Yeah, bye. [KNOCKING] [PHONE PLACED ON CRADLE] [SOMBER MUSIC] [MUSIC TURNS DARK] [SIREN IN BACKGROUND] [BEEP] Concierge. This is Roberts in 213. [KNOCKING] Can-- hang on a sec. Yeah, I'll be right there. Can you get me a taxi-- [KNOCKING] --for this evening for 6:30? I'll be right there. Good evening. Colonel Koslovska, Bulgarian Security Division. May we speak? Yeah, sure. Come in. Oh. I love these new Western-style hotels. Hmm. What can I do for you, Colonel Koslovski? Koslovska. In Bulgarian, it's Koslovska. Oh, oh. Hmm. I understand you're here as a member of the foreign press. It's what my visa says. Mm-hmm. What are you reporting on? I was supposed to cover Charlie Venco's work. A tragedy. Is this normally your, uh, bowl of soup? Not really. But that's not what you came here to ask me, is it? [SIGHS] Yes. Well, to the point. Mr. Roberts, the Bulgarian government needs your help. I'm all ears. Did Venco tell you something about his work? That it had something to do with a cure for blood diseases. Wasn't it? Yes and no. Well, what is it? He never gave you any details? I can't say that he did. You're making it sound like he was doing something illegal here. [WRY LAUGH] Well? You should stick to stories you can handle. Da? Now, just wait a minute. You come in here insinuating that a friend of mine is doing something illegal. And then you tell me to butt out? That it's not my "bowl of soup"? Have a good flight back. [SIGHS] He's not here to defend himself. [DOOR CLOSES] [EXHALES LOUDLY] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [MUSIC - "VICTIM"] (SINGING) Every 30 seconds, someone's chasing a tear. And every other minute gets lost in a year. Every half an hour, someone's pointin' at me. Hello there. (SINGING) And once in while, I feel the shadow of the guilt I'm passing by. And I feel the shadow of my sins. I've reached a point where I can't stop the pain that I have caused. I'm a victim. A victim of my selfish life. You're a victim. A victim of my hopeless pride. You're a victim. Caught inside my web of lies. You're a victim. A casualty of me and my disease. Oh. Oh, I'm a victim. [APPLAUSE] [CHATTER IN BULGARIAN] ANNOUNCER: [SPEAKING BULGARIAN] Alexa Kazan. [MUSIC PLAYING] (SINGING) Hey, hey. Oh, whoa. Hey. [WORDLESS SINGING] Hey, hey. Hey, hey. Hey, hey. Hey, hey. I'm looking for Alexa Kazan. No. Well, maybe we can work something out. [FLIPPING THROUGH CASH] [CHATTER IN BACKGROUND] [ROCK MUSIC IN BACKGROUND] Thank you. No friend. But you took my money. [GRUNTS] [CRIES OUT] [BREATHING HEAVILY] Oh! Yow! [MOANING] Where is Alexa Kazan? [GRUNTS] [MOANS] Oh, shit. I'm sorry. I should have knocked. I guess Americans don't believe in that. Charlie did the same. I said I'm sorry. It's OK, Mr. Roberts. Or can I call you Steve now that you've seen me naked? STEVE: [SNORTS] Yeah, that's fine. So I guess you do know me. Could you help to wrap this around? I'm sorry about Charlie. Yeah, me too. Are you going to tie me up or not? Oh yeah, sure. Look, you don't have to answer the question, but I'd like to talk to you later about Charlie. You knew him as well as I did. What more can I tell you? What he was doing in Sofia. Was it legal? [SPEAKING BULGARIAN] Kazan. Alexa. Look. I'm only here till tomorrow. STAGE MANAGER: Alexa. [BULGARIAN] I think Charlie may have been killed because of something he was working on. What? Yeah. I mean, I know it's out there. But-- Alexa, [BULGARIAN]. OK. The Mazapa restaurant for breakfast-- 9 o'clock. [LAUGHTER AND CHATTER IN BACKGROUND] [BIRDS CHIRPING AND JAZZ MUSIC] [SPEAKING BULGARIAN] Roberts. This will get me to Vasil Street? Yeah. Thank you. [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] [CELLPHONE BUTTONS BEEPING] Oh! [DISBELIEVING LAUGH] [CHATTER IN BACKGROUND] I'm looking for Captain Serge. [POWER EQUIPMENT] Captain Serge? [BULGARIAN] I heard you charter boats. Weekends. [BULGARIAN] Who are you? I'm a friend of Charlie Venco's. No, no. Go away. Why is it that nobody wants to talk about Charlie? It was an accident. Did I say it wasn't? I don't know. Nothing. [BULGARIAN] OK. Can you at least tell me who else was on the boat? I said go away. Not until I get some answers. You go now. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] Please. Please. I know nothing. Something tells me you do. Now, who else? [GRUNTING] [BREATHING HEAVILY] Now, who else? His assistant, Boev. Emil Boev? I heard Charlie was pulled over by a sturgeon and was killed by your propeller. When a fish is hooked, I stop the engine. I know how to fish. But if you stopped the engine, then how-- 46 years without a casualty. I have taken the best in the world out. Never had anything like this travesty. I am too old. And what happened? You should go home, [BULGARIAN].. This is Sofia. Is murder any different here? [AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE] [SHOUTING IN BULGARIAN] [BIRDS CHIRPING AND CHATTER IN BACKGROUND] Good morning. What happened? I was sightseeing on the wrong side of town. Thanks. You hungry? Yeah, I'm starving. [BULGARIAN] So what really happened? I decided to go and have a little chat with the captain of Charlie's boat. While I was there, these two thugs showed up, put a bullet in his chest. That's horrible. Yeah, well, [SCOFFS] makes a change from boring art premieres. You certainly attracted some attention. Yeah. No shit. Customs, cops, thugs, colonels. Koslovski? She showed up after you left. Yeah, I bet she did. What was Charlie into, Alexa? I don't understand. Medical research doesn't get you killed. It doesn't get you murdered. His death was an accident. What? Just like the captain's? What is it? I'm just trying to figure out why this isn't more upsetting for you. How dare you tell me how I should feel about Charlie's death. I'm sorry. [SIGHS] Have you any idea who would have wanted Charlie dead? No. This investigating is dangerous. In Bulgaria, the walls have ears. That still doesn't explain why the government is so interested in Charlie's research. Well, if the cure for AIDS was found in Bulgaria, that would help with investment from the West. Exactly. So why kill him? No reason. That's why it was an accident. But what about Phillips' story? It doesn't match the captain's. He was killed, Alexa. I'm telling you, he was murdered. I'm willing to bet my life on it. Look, I know Charlie. He loved to work at home. If we could just go to his place, maybe we'd get lucky. I have a key. I live with him. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] You wait here. [BIRDS CHIRPING] [HINGE SQUEALS] Animals. Well, I guess we were too late. You still think it was an accident? Nice place he had here. Yeah. Charlie always wanted the best. Yeah, even as a kid, he said he'd die rich. So when you first met? It was in junior high. I remember we were taking a math test. Charlie was cheating from the kid in front of him. I was staring at him. I couldn't believe his nerve. But the teacher saw me, so she sends me to the principal's office. [CHUCKLES] Just when I thought I was toast, Charlie steps and fesses up. He got two days' suspension and a black eye from his old man for that one. But he was proud of it. So was I. Ever since then, he looked out for me. I guess nobody looked out for him. Any idea where he might have kept more papers? No, just there. Come on. Let's get out of here, huh? Maybe the cabbie knows a safe place. ALEXA: I still have my apartment downtown. STEVE: How long did you and Charlie go out? For a month. We met at the club. And you moved in so soon? Don't judge. In Sofia, one lives as best as one can. Everything is based on mutual need. Yeah, right. You're schmaltzy. Why? Because I believe in something more than mutual need? Love is what you make of it. [LAUGHS] Now, that sounds like Charlie. [BIRDS CHIRPING] I don't understand-- marked money? Yeah. They're trying to keep tabs on me. That's why I'm going to need your help. Like what? Some clean money, information, some inquiries, a copy of the autopsy report. And I need to find that guy, Emil Boev. No, wait. I really can't. Bulgaria might not be America, but there's a place for me in this society. And it is a decent place. Was it decent for Charlie? Yes. And he'll be remembered well if you don't dig anything up. Charlie's clean. He always has been. Why don't you leave it alone then? STEVE: I can't. Why not? Because I'm the only one in Bulgaria who seems to care whether Charlie was murdered or not. And that's not right. [SIGHS] Look, I'm not cut out for this. So I need your help. Thank you. Look, I'll call you later, OK? Good luck. NURSE: [SPEAKING BULGARIAN] Excuse me. [BULGARIAN] Do you speak English? Yeah. I'm looking for a Dr. Emil Boev. You're Dr. Venco's American friend. Yeah. Boev's not here. No one's seen him in many days. Why am I not surprised? I take it that's an unusual thing. He never missed a day of work. Employee of the Month. [BABY CRYING IN BACKGROUND] Then all of a sudden, he is vanished. That's Emil Boev? Of course. [IRONIC LAUGH] It's funny what life kicks up, no? Maybe. Could you please show me Dr. Venco's office? I'm afraid that's not permitted. Leave us. And you are? Dr. Kruger, director of the center. I'm Steve Roberts. I'm looking for Emil Boev. He's on illness leave. But the nurse told me that-- He's ill. OK. Well, I just thought it would be OK if I could see some of Charlie's things. Dr. Venco is dead. I'm afraid you have no business here. Then I guess you don't want to hear about the research I turned up on the project. What? Yeah, Charlie was in touch with me at home all the time about the project, the details. Whew. They make for some interesting reading. Any information transmitted to you by Dr. Venco was done so illegally. Just save it, Doc. If you want to know what I know, then you let me in. I cannot. Okey-dokey. But that's tough for you, because your government would have liked that quote. [DIALING PHONE] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [CAR APPROACHING] [BREATHING HEAVILY] [SHOUTING IN BULGARIAN] [GUNSHOTS] [GRUNTING] [CRYING OUT] Oh! [GUNSHOTS] PURSUER: [SHOUTING IN BULGARIAN] [CHATTER IN BACKGROUND] [SPEAKING BULGARIAN] Hoo-ah. [SCREAMING IN BACKGROUND] ALL: [GRUNTING WHILE FIGHTING] [BULGARIAN] Hee-yah. Oh! [MOANS] [GRUNTS] BOTH: [GRUNTING WHILE FIGHTING] [GUNSHOT] [GUNFIRE] [GRUNTS] ALL: [GRUNTING WHILE FIGHTING] [MOANS] [BREATHING HEAVILY] You've got to be one of our more annoying journalists, Mr. Roberts. That's funny. That's what my editor says. You two should get together for lunch sometime. Who have we got here? Laurel and Hardy? Interpol-- I'm impressed. But you can cut this cloak and dagger shit. I've done nothing. You're [INAUDIBLE] an international investigation. Oh, get real. I warned you, Mr. Roberts. Yeah, I know. I know. Stick to stories that I can handle, right? INTERPOL AGENT 1: What did you and the woman talk about? It's personal. INTERPOL AGENT 2: What were you doing at the medical center? Getting a checkup. You have no idea what you facing, do you? [CHUCKLES] Oh, yes, I do-- two idiots. INTERPOL AGENT 2: I'm going to ask you again. What were you-- I was trying to figure out who killed Charlie Venco. But, of course, you already know that, don't you? You're about to be charged with obstruction, conspiracy, trafficking-- Yeah, why don't you throw in the murder of the captain? Or maybe you can pin that on Charlie too. Oh, enough. What can we do to satisfy you, Mr. Roberts? Well, you can start off by telling me who killed Charlie. We think it was the Russian mafia. And unless you want to end up in a coffin-- yes, Venco was involved with them. How? That I cannot tell you. But I must say that your continued intrusions could bring to light some rather unsavory facts concerning your friend. Leave it alone, and he might rest in peace. It's a lousy deal. It's the best I can offer. [LAUGHS] You're a real piece of work, you know that? [SPEAKING BULGARIAN] If you leave your room, you'll be arrested. Understood? Da. [SIGHS] [DOOR CLOSES] [MUSIC PLAYING AND CHATTER IN BACKGROUND] Hello, Mr. Roberts. You order room service? Health inspector coming through. [MUFFLED SHOUTING] [KNOCKING] Who is it? STEVE: Me, Steve. Bastards. Did they take anything? Nope. They said if I saw you again they'd lock me away for life. On what charge? Being HIV-infected. What? But I'm not really. Koslovska left this. It's a forged test with my name on it. In this country, that's a death sentence. [DISGUSTED SIGH] What a bitch. She can't do this. I mean, what is she after? I don't know. Well, think. Charlie must have said something. I told you no. He never talked about his business, and I never asked. Just as long as he paid the bills, right? I'm sorry. It's just this is so frustrating. [BELLS RINGING IN BACKGROUND] [BIRDS CHIRPING] The whole thing's getting scary. Tell me about it. I'm used to covering dog shows. You're not doing this just for Charlie, are you? I don't know. My sensei says I lack follow-through. My editor thinks I lack passion. And maybe I just lack sense. When I got Charlie's message, I thought, this is it, a chance to follow through on something that really matters. Turns out I was wrong. It's not your fault. [IRONIC CHUCKLE] Been saying that all my life. Koslovska seems to think that Charlie was killed by the Russian mafia. What? What do you know about that? I never really asked. Look, if you don't want to talk to me, I'll go. But don't give me this "Miss Innocent" crap. You're really screwing me up, you know. You? Look at my place, my life. What is Charlie's connection with the mob? I don't know. Bullshit! How dare you. Get out. Alexa, wait. Stop! What? Don't hit me. Hit you? What do you-- I would-- Jesus Christ. Charlie. He hit you, right? Son of a bitch. - Don't say that. STEVE: Why not? Because he took care of me. That doesn't justify it. Then because he was your friend. I think I should leave. They helped finance the research. The Russians, they backed him. I thought the government did that. Well, yeah, at first, but with the democratic economy collapsing and no more foreign aid, money was drying up. So Charlie went to the mob. But why would the mob finance medical research? There's got to be a racket here somewhere. Who was Charlie's contact? Yaro Milavo, head of the Russian mafia here in Bulgaria. When did Charlie last see him? The day he died. He was on the boat. - What? He was on the boat? Did they ever question him? You don't understand. Yaro is very dangerous. How do you know he was there? Charlie said he would be. So Yaro killed Charlie? Maybe. No one knows for sure. Of course. He was recouping his investment. Wait a minute. Phillips was on that boat. If we can get Phillips to testify, we can nail Yaro. You don't want to get that deep. We'll meet with Bill tomorrow. ALEXA: Good morning. Sleep well? [SIGHS] Yeah, fine, thanks. Thought you could need a good start. Yeah, you keep feeding me like this, I may never want to leave. I'm coming with you. No chance. I have every right. Why the sudden interest? You. Such deep loyalty makes me ashamed. [SCOFFS] Well, don't be. I'm out of my mind. I don't normally have this kind of courage. I could crumble at any moment. I don't think so, Steve Roberts. And I don't think you should get any more involved. My apartment's trashed. Got a life sentence with a bogus AIDS test. What more can they do? [CHUCKLES] So what's the plan? [MUSIC PLAYING] Chill out, shorty. I need to talk to your boss. That way. Go ahead. STEVE: Come on. Let's see what Phillips knows. We gotta chat, Bill. I don't understand. Cut the crap. I've got cops, and robbers, and mobsters as new best friends. And I know Yaro was on the boat. The Russian mob knows. Don't look at her. This is between you and me. Look, if I say anything, I'm finished. You saw everything, didn't you? The Russians killed him. Mr. Roberts, I think you're in way over your head. Yeah, well, I'm learning to swim. Was Charlie bilking the mob? Yeah, he was in grave trouble. That's why he was looking for safe passage out of Sofia. [TIRES SQUEALING] [AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE] [BYSTANDERS SCREAMING AND SHOUTING] [GUNSHOTS] Come on! Let's go! [GUNSHOTS] [TIRES SQUEALING] [GUNFIRE] [AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE] Shit! [AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE] Jesus Christ! Steve! STEVE: Can you use it? ALEXA: No. Good, shoot. What? Shoot! Shoot them. ALEXA: [COCKS GUN] [GUNSHOT] [EXPLOSION] [AIR HORN] [TIRES SQUEALING] [EXPLOSION] [EXPLOSION] Good shooting, Alexa. [APPROACHING SIREN] [BIRDS CHIRPING] I think most have left. You sure you have a way in? I used to visit Charlie. But I still don't see why-- What we need is in there. Well, how do you know? Because Kruger was so insistent that I didn't see anything. But you heard Phillips. That just doesn't add up. Why would Interpol be interested in a debt that Charlie has with the mob? Come on. Let's go. [HAUNTING MUSIC] [SPEAKING BULGARIAN] Right there. [SIGHS] OK. Password. [TYPING] [DING] Looks like somebody's already tried. Any idea? Yeah. [TYPING] [SERIES OF DINGS] "Citizen Kane"-- it's Charlie's favorite movie. I guess you're the only one who would know that. All right. Let's try and make some sense of this. Test procedures, results, goals, formulas-- [TYPING] [DING] Oh. Shit. What is it? I think I just deleted some formula. All right. Let's try results. [TYPING] [SIGHS] Charlie had a couple of things almost completed. Let's see what he had at 100%. [TYPING] OK. Something called "Blue Mist." [BULGARIAN] It's true. What do you mean? What's true? Blue Mist. That's a new drug in Bulgaria. They say a hundred percent addictive. Charlie was into drugs? [MOUSE CLICK] Jesus Christ. According to this, it attaches itself to human DNA. [SIGHS] This is a genetic narcotic. Charlie's masterpiece. I don't understand that. The government would never sponsor this. It's got nothing to do with the government. This is Charlie's deal with the mob. This is money for the ultimate drug. [GUNSHOT] [GLASS SHATTERS] [GUNSHOTS] [CRIES OUT] Come on. Let's go. [FIRE ALARM BELL] SECURITY: [BULGARIAN] ALL: [GRUNTING WHILE FIGHTING] Ah! [MOANING] Uh! [COUGHING] Come on. Let's go. You knew, didn't you? Well, I had heard a rumor. - Why didn't you tell me? - It was a rumor. I'm not a reporter, Steve. Well, just how far has this rumor gone? I'll show you. [CRYING AND MOANING] [COUGHING AND MOANING] [VOMITING SOUNDS] [SPEAKING BULGARIAN] Ah! Ah! Ah! Who's this? Lora Tatiana. I heard she was here. Who is she? She used to be a showgirl too, before Blue Mist. Before Charlie got to her. [SPEAKING BULGARIAN] Where is [BULGARIAN]? [SHOUTING IN BULGARIAN] [GASPS] [BULGARIAN] It's OK. It's OK. Jesus Christ. Hey, come on. I've got to get you out of here. [BIRDS CHIRPING] [GRUNTS] Lay down. Try and relax. [HYPERVENTILATING] Oh, shit. You got any, um, uh, peroxide or alcohol, something I can clean this with? Yes. It's in the bottom drawer over there. Do you know what you're doing? Uh, yeah, sure. I once did a story on a, um-- on a veterinary clinic. ALEXA: That's what I was afraid of. Let me see this. Oh, shit. [GRUNTS] This is gonna sting, OK? [GASPS IN PAIN] You treat all your ladies like that? Only the ones that I really like. Oh, shit. Oh, man. What the hell am I doing here? [HAUNTING MUSIC] Hi. Hi. How you feeling? Much better, thanks. How long have I been-- Two days. You must be starving. There's nothing in the house. I was going to go out, but I didn't want to leave you alone. But if you're hungry, then I can go get something. No, wait. Everything Charlie said about you is true. You are kind, caring-- And stupid. If I'd left this alone, then none of this would have happened. He was your friend. Yeah, well, I'm not too proud of that right now, you know? I mean, Christ, you think you know someone after 25 years. Don't judge him. Charlie is Charlie. He cares in his own way. How can you say that after all he's done to you? Well, Charlie was there during the worst part of my life, when I was all alone, barely surviving. And Charlie was there. He's using you, like he uses all women. Sofia is a cruel city, a city of fear. The weak die quickly. Charlie helped me survive. And he would have done the same for you. Yeah, well, I don't need help from somebody like that, OK? [ROMANTIC MUSIC] [BIRDS CHIRPING] [ALARM BUZZING] [SIGHS] [SIGHS] [SIGHS] MAN: [SPEAKING BULGARIAN] [CLEARS THROAT] I'm here for Alexa, pal. [SPEAKING BULGARIAN] Oh. I thought you'd be in America by now, Mr. Roberts. I'm sorry to disappoint you, Colonel Koslovska. I took a wrong turn. [SIGHS] You want Charlie Venco? Then bring a shovel. [THUNDER AND RAIN] [CROW CAWING] Oh, Jesus Christ. [COUGHS] That is not Charlie. How can you be sure? Because Charlie had a birthmark on his chest. This, for Christ's sake, is Emil Boev. Don't you people do autopsies at the morgue here? Three witnesses testified that it was Venco. Phillips, the captain, and who else? INTERPOL AGENT 2: That's not important. Where is Venco? I don't know. I've got to find out what happened to Charlie, Vasyl. VASYL: I told you it was a tricky city, Mr. Roberts. But don't worry. I can guide you. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] Steve. Charlie? [BIRDS CHIRPING] [LAUGHS] It's great to see ya. But-- I thought you were-- Alive and well. Let's walk. [CHILDREN PLAYING] What the fuck is going on. Charlie? Since I got here, there's been military, cops, thugs shooting at me. Alexa, she's-- Whoa, relax. I had to fake my own death. Blue Mist. You've become a real reporter. It seems everyone wants a piece of it, but only I know the formula. I figured if I'm dead, so is Blue Mist. STEVE: Just tell me you're not really behind it. Wish I could. [COUGHS] [TRYING TO GET INHALER TO WORK] [DISGUSTED SIGH] Can't even get any decent asthma medicine around here anymore. This stuff's bad news, Charlie. I know, buddy. People are dying, for Christ's sake. I had no choice, Steve. I try to do good and what happens? The FDA shuts me down. They tell me what I'm doing is too experimental to try on humans. So I look for other avenues. The fucking State Department charges me with espionage. You believe that? The Bulgarians, well, they give me refuge. But now I owe them. I gotta deliver the greatest cure of our time, you know, help put them on the map, solve their financial woes. Turns out I'm a prisoner either way. [MONKEY SCREECHING] You're not the victim here, Charlie. CHARLIE: Don't be naive, buddy. You want a killer? Look around you. For 10 years now, people have been dying by the tens of thousands in this country. And why? Because the new democracy lacks the support to provide the bare essentials to lead a decent life-- medicines, food, clothing. If you're going to point fingers, start looking at the regime America helped erect. Why'd you do it, Charlie? What, was it the money? I sunk everything I had into it. With the Soviet Union gone, times got tight in Bulgaria, especially for research that doesn't pan out. [SIGHS] CHARLIE: Yaro was my last resort. [BEAR CALLING] STEVE: So the Russian mob made you an offer. [IRONIC LAUGH] Is that why I'm here, to write your obituary? Seems we've both been led down the garden path, buddy. Come on, Charlie. Let's just go back to the States. No, I'm dead. Remember? And what if I go to the police? I wouldn't advise that. Yeah, what's to stop me? Alexa, for one. I noticed you've become attached and vice versa. And she's already under close scrutiny. It would be a real shame if evidence surfaced that tied her to this mess. Oh, you son of a bitch. Easy. You're like a brother to me, Steve. But don't push it. Now, I can get you and her out of Bulgaria. We don't need your help. I know about the drummed-up AIDS test. That's very serious here. It makes it almost impossible to enter any other country. But I can fix that. That's my cue. Here's a number you can reach me. Don't go to the cops, buddy. It will only make it worse. No cops. Oh! You are lucky to be in one piece, my friend. Tell that to my head. Yaro, I presume. I see we need no introductions. Yeah, well, now that the pleasantries are over, why the invite? Care to guess? Charlie? I'm not concerned with that. Then what? The girl. Alexa? I don't understand. That's why you have no history here, no place. Now, I offer you this. Leave Bulgaria quietly, and the girl and you may live. With an offer like that, who can refuse? If you are not gone by morning-- Yeah, I know. I'll be international headlines, right? Tell me something. Were you on the boat when Charlie was killed? Do I look like a fisherman? [MUSIC PLAYING] Charlie's a liar. Yaro wasn't even on the boat. You've been lying to me. I thought he was. That's what I was told. If somebody's been lying to you, I'm going to find out why. The truth can be a dangerous thing in Sofia. [DIAL TONE] [DIALING] Charlie. It's Steve. You win. Get us out. 4:30, marketplace. Yeah. Got it. We'll be there. OK, we're on. But the girl goes with me. That's impossible. If she's not there, they'll know it's a setup. He's right. [BELL RINGING] So where are we meeting him? He'll let us know. Just walk. [CHATTER AND BIRDS CHIRPING] So what was Yaro to you? [CAR PASSES BY] Well, he confided an interest in you. I was his companion. Companion? Before Charlie. He was a lonely old man. He needed someone to talk to. It was just companionship, nothing more. You introduced him to Charlie. He loved you very much. He still does. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] PERFORMERS: [CLAPPING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [SPEAKING BULGARIAN] [RADIO STATIC] [KEYS RADIO] [SPEAKING BULGARIAN] [BULGARIAN] Hey, buddy, it's OK. Nice to see you, baby, but we have to move quickly. [SPEAKING BULGARIAN] [SPEAKING BULGARIAN] [SPEAKING BULGARIAN] [BULGARIAN] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [ENGINE STARTS] CHARLIE: Come on, Steve. Let's go. [INHALES] What are we doing here, Charlie? Shortly, a chopper is going to land here and fly us to Istanbul. The Turkish cartel? Pretty nifty, huh? You double-crossed the Russian mob? Are you fucking insane? No, just richer. [LAUGHS] The police know you're alive, Charlie, and so does Interpol. Is this true, baby? Fuck! I told you not to go to them. You're a murderer, Charlie! [APPROACHING HELICOPTER] You're not going to use that, man. Don't be so sure. Charlie, there's no need. Interpol can still get to me, but only if they know my whereabouts. Come on, Steve. Be reasonable. We can all get out of here alive, fly to Istanbul, live like kings. Blue Mist will make us millions. I want no part of your vile scheme. You break my heart, buddy. What about you, baby? [ACTION MUSIC] [AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE] Koslovska. How? [GUNFIRE] How? You have no idea what you just did to me. Uh! Ah! Oh. [GRUNTS] [GRUNTS] ALL: [GRUNTING WHILE FIGHTING] Ah! [MOANING] [GUNFIRE] Ah! [EXPLOSION] ALL: [GRUNTING WHILE FIGHTING] [AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE] [MOANING] [GUNFIRE IN BACKGROUND] Give it up, Charlie. You're surrounded. [GUNSHOTS] Back off, Steve. I can handle this myself. [AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE] [GUNSHOT] [ACTION MUSIC] [AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE] Ah! Ah! Ah! [GASPING FOR AIR] Give it up, Charlie. It's the end of the line. There's nowhere else to go. Buddy, you should've stayed home. [GASPING] Well, come on. Do it then, huh? Fuck! Why did you come here? Let's just go home before anyone else gets hurt. [INHALES] [GASPING] [GUNSHOT] Ah! STEVE: No! [GASPING] Charlie! Come on, buddy. I'm losing it here. [GASPING] [GROANS] [GRUNTING] [GRUNTS] Hang on, man. I got you. [GRUNTS] [GUNFIRE IN BACKGROUND] Hurry. I need some help up here. CHARLIE: [GASPING IN FEAR] I ain't going to prison, man. You won't. We'll work it out, I promise. Hurry, goddammit. [GUNFIRE] I ain't saying "Rosebud" yet. [GUNSHOT] CHARLIE: [GASPING] [GUNSHOTS] Ah! [THUD] [GASPING] Oh. [APPROACHING HELICOPTER] [CHATTER IN BULGARIAN] [SOMBER MUSIC] [HELICOPTER RECEDING] Funny what life kicks up, no? Let's hope this time it was really Venco. It was you that sent for me to flush Charlie out. Blue Mist was created in Bulgaria. We had to contain it. You did this country and the world a service. So how come it doesn't feel like it? My father always said the hard choices were the right choices. I'll make sure I put that in my next column. You still want to catch that plane? [CHATTER IN BULGARIAN] Give me a minute. I'll wait over there. Steve, I was-- On the boat. Koslovski said that three witnesses testified that Charlie was dead-- the Captain, Phillips, and you. You played me from the get-go, ever since that Las Vegas flyer was slipped under my door. It was still Sofia. It was your ticket out. Like you said, the new freedom's not all it's cracked up to be without Charlie, right? What now? Now I really will go home. Hope you'll visit us again under better circumstances. I'm sure you'll find Bulgaria charming to write about. I imagine you will get some notoriety. Make big news back home? STEVE: Not this time, Colonel. This is one story I think is better left untold.
