Welcome, sir. - Thank you very much. You're the first in the district to get the new model car, therefore the company took special interest in this grand delivery. Welcome sir. - Welcome sir. Thank you very much. Greetings. Please come, sir. - Come, sir. Police! Jani! Jani, you're speeding the car so fast that I want to pee. Pull over. Even you pee, don't dirty the car. Come on. Lucky someone took away the car else boss would be a dead meat. Get lost! I don't care about my life but nothing should happen to my boss. Sir, I didn't know it was your car. After your car blew up into pieces this is the only piece we found. - Hey! Sir, we are thieves but we didn't steal your car. I am passionate about driving. I saw the car, I liked it very much, I desired to go for a drive. I stopped the car at the roadside and the car blew up. Will you take away the car because you liked it? Don't think a lot, you will become old like me. You have a long life. Someone plotted to kill me by planting bomb in the car but I was not destined to die. My well-wishers failed to understand that. I am not scared of death but I am afraid that I won't be able to serve the people. You drove away my fear by saving my life. Give me that. Take how much ever money you want. If it's not enough, I will give you more. Sir, I admit I am a thief but I don't even a single penny for free. But if you still want to help me, I have a request. There's scarcity of drinking water in our locality, we haven't received water for years, please help us if you can. I will look into it. Sir. - Stay put, I will go for jogging. Sir, you're black belt, I will deal with them, please sit. - Okay. The government has provided you with security, why did you come alone? Jani, I don't need security when you're with me. Sir, I am not a hero. You're indeed a hero but you have saved me twice though I am nowhere related to you. Your parents are really lucky. Unfortunately, I am an orphan. The one who tells you're orphan is an orphan though he has a family. Hereafter, don't say you're an orphan, you have me. I am not an emotional person. I am a very jovial person, I prefer my life to be colorful. I have a task to finish, I will take leave. I summoned you from Andhra Pradesh to kill Shetty but your men failed to do so. Tell me what happened. Boss, he was very quick, he didn't give us even one second to react. He thrashed all of us to pulp. You're talking about him, tell me his name. Jani. - What did you say? Jani. - It was Jani again. Alright. People in Andhra Pradesh tremble in fear when they see me, but my men failed in Karnataka... - Stop it! That's Andhra Pradesh, this is Karnataka, the land of the braves. Everyone man born here is brave. Jani paralyzed my plot, he is invincible. But my enemy is not Jani, it's Shetty, find a way to kill him. I will kill Shetty, Jani thrashed my men, I am deeply upset. I will also kill Jani. Jani! Even though we're surrounded by ocean we have to walk 7 miles to fetch water. It is very unfortunate. My God! Hey! What happened? Oh, my God! I am decked with gold ornaments but I don't have iron to save this good boy. Had I not gone to Dubai there would've been iron bracelet in my wrist instead of gold. I don't have iron to save this boy. God, at least You save him. Though God will be late, He won't let you down. I will save you at any cost. Pick him up before he stops frothing. He is doomed. - Pick him up, sir. Now you get in. Even God won't be able to rescue you. Lord Panduranga! 'Kadamba.' You have seen tiger walking with elephant, you have seen it fight with loin have you ever seen it dressed in police uniform? Don't see, you will a dead meat. This hand is the wealth of 50 million Kannadigas. Sir, it's now 70 million. - Is that so? People have worked overnight without my knowledge. No problem, I will handle the case at night. Hereafter, I will assign work to men during night times. Complete the dialogue from the film Kadamba. Very good. The criminals who hate me love the artist in me. People will love a good actor even after he dies. Am I right? You idiot, speak up. - Sir! I want to deliver dialogues, why do you distract me? Get up. Where is your pant? Have you been charged in rape case? Sir, someone stole my gold ornaments. Gold... Yes. My God! Somebody help me! Please help him! Where did the incident take place? Sir, you're telling everything so accurately as if you're the mastermind. I am actor cum director. Then where is police officer Panduranga amidst the two? Come here. Where did I stop? - Sir! Where did I stop? - Please stop it. Talk about my case. Here comes Jani. Wow! Here comes my boy! Come. Sir, these are my ornaments. It was he who stole them. He is a great actor. He is quite impressive. Before I turn violent, arrest him. Sir. Tell him not to underestimate thieves. Do you think it is easy to commit theft? We drank a bottle of liquor at night, had a serious discussion. By morning, we drank a couple of bottles more. We also need to spend money on snacks. That's not all. To get rid of the hangover of the liquor... Did you drink 20 tender coconuts and curds 1 liter? Sir, you guessed it so right. I am a drunkard. - Hey! You distracted me when I was delivering dialogues. Stop talking rubbish. You rascal! Sir, he's a little boy, let him go. - He's saying I am little boy. I don't want money, please recover my ornaments. Ornaments? Shut up! You give me Rs. 8000. Mr. Pandu. - Greetings, sir. Jani, you're trying to trick me? - Sir, I've no idea if you keep up time on other occasions but you arrive early on such occasions. Why? The police is presumptuously daring. - It's quite obvious. Don't I look daring to you? Don't you think you're mistaken? Don't hurt a dead body, it's pains. You're right, sir. Let's go, sir. - Nonsense! If a policeman goes to liquor bar during duty, people will swear him, Though the police is corrupt, it shouldn't be evident. Change your dress. The damsels are waiting for us, come fast. I used to fool people but he fooled me today. He committed the theft with sheer brilliance. - Sir. Goldman! You were born nude, you'll be buried nude, life is weekend, enjoy till the end. Why are you gazing at me? Stop it! Why? That's not dance, watch. Hello. - Dad, what I heard is true? What are you talking about? Dad, don't hide anything from me, I know everything. It's petty matter. We fought Britishers courageously. Our body dies, our soul doesn't. Dad, don't talk about death. If something happens to you, even I will die. Don't say that. I've nobody other than you. I will come back to India after my results, I will stay with you. I will give you a surprise soon after you come to India. Bye, and take care. Jani! Hi. How many have I told you not to tie the dog on the day you don't return home? Oh. - It was barking constantly during your absence. I was totally annoyed, so I freed him early in the morning. Look young Diana, whether you free Joe or not, he will definitely come looking for me. Am I right, Jo? - Look Jani, naming the dog is not enough, you should also provide him with food. You're absolutely right, Diana. Joe, my baby. - He is at it again. Only today I realized that consuming of liquor destroys relationships but I can't quit drinking liquor, Jo. Because for drunkards like me who are in despair liquor is the only thing that gives us peace. It is futile to advice you. Is that so? You're absolutely right, Diana. Come, let's see what's there to eat. Joe, though there's everything in my house, there's still nothing. It's very unfortunate. Get married. I don't forget that I am a thief. There's a saying. 'A thief's wife is always a widow.' But I don't believe it because the parents find a guy who's a doctor or a lawyer or an engineer for their daughter who's educated. But I deserve someone who is a thief too which is impossible. You will definitely find one. Will I find a girl who's a thief? Of course. If it comes true, our pair will be the eighth wonder of the world. Throw the ball! Catch! Water in our locality! Water in our locality! Water in our locality! Wow! Water in our locality! Come fast. Water in our locality. We are getting in our locality after several years. God bless the one who made it happen. God bless him. Sir, tender file. Did you check it properly? - Yes, sir. Have it checked thoroughly again. - Okay, sir. Give me. I will take your leave, sir. - Okay. Hello. As the election is approaching, you come to me without intimation. But you fulfill the wants of the party selflessly. I am not giving fund for the party, I am giving fund for the good work you do for the people. Here you are. Let's go. Why there's pin drop silence? He can't make noise, he is an old man. He is a diabetic, he's also suffering from blood pressure but he's trying to entertain himself by ogling at that woman. If he continues to do so, he will pay a huge price. Next! I like it! Has the monkey man arrived? No, the flat is empty. - Next. He's a lucky man. The one who doubt his wife shouldn't lock the house but change her mind. See. Here comes the monkey man. The cap, the coat... He will take off everything. What next? What's the hurry? You're more excited than me. The hero is advancing. What about the heroine? Joe, you're an animal, you talk logic. When you talk it's magic, when I talk it's logic? Even a dog is questioning me. Alright, good change. Both are breathing standing in front of each other. What next? Both have come close to each other. They are looking into each other's eyes. I think they should hurry up. What did you say? Did they get started? They ruined our desire by putting off the light. Darn it. Nobody will understand our problem. Lakshmi. - Yes. I have urgent work, prepare breakfast quickly, I will freshen up and come. Brother. Yes. Do you think what you're doing is right? What have I done? Uncle. - Hey. Mom, I am going to college. Bye. Bye, Uncle. - Bye. You were saying something. You must remember that you have a niece who is of a marriageable age. I feel disgusted to even say it. Oh. You're talking about her. Look, I am not married to her but it is fact that she's your sister-in-law. I can't accept the person who sleeps with you just to please you as sister-in-law. It's my personal matter, stay out of it. Do you hear the sound of the waves? Yes, I do. But I thought I would die even before I could hear the sound of waves, Jani. May God grant you a long life, may He grant you happiness. My dear sweetie, it's indeed a good offer but I don't want it. I don't want to live long. Bless me so that I keep smiling all the time. Okay? - Okay. Bye. Enjoy the sound of the waves. Okay. What's your problem? It's been two days since I drank with you, if I meet with you tonight... I don't have Indian currency, I only have U.S dollars. Let's party tonight. That's fantastic. By the way... - You mean meat? I will get it. But you will bear the expense. Look, I will get mutton bones for Jo. Will you have jackal bones? Hold on. Hey! Hey! Stop! Hey! Hey! Stop! The sari... Hey! Stop! Hey! Stop! Hey! Hey! Stop! Jani, the snake killed its own master. You're an infamous thief, but you got robbed. My body is itching. - Sir, let's buy fritters from a different hotel from tomorrow. My body is itchy too. Make him drink the acid which is in the toilet, let him have a miserable death. How dare you teach me! Sir... If I become lenient towards you because you collect bride for me you will take advantage of me. Are you trying to trick me? Hereafter, you will maintain distance between the two of us. Should I maintain distance behind you or in the front? - In the center. Go get tea. - Okay, sir. Jani, didn't you hear the sound of bangles when she put her hand into your pocket? Sir, she was wearing burqa, sari, jacket, jeans... - My God. You're so smart. I am so ashamed to be your guru. I rather quit my job and become a watchman to the house where has no men. - That's a good idea, sir. You can sleep during daytime and work during night time. Shut up, you idiot! You don't see her face, so I won't take up the case. - Sir, so what if I didn't see her face, I have seen her back. On that basis, I will nab her and that's for sure. Jani, why have you become dull? Krishna, Inspector Ranganna is right. Had a man robbed me, I would've drank the liquor in one gulp by now. But it's a girl who robbed me, I am so angry that I feel like drinking liquor without diluting it. Don't worry Jani, be happy. Krishna, you fixed the mobile phone. I thought you were good for nothing I am proud of your mother. My God! How can you receive someone else's call? You must be a shameless guy. Hello, young lady. Your mobile phone got fixed because I am not shameless. By the way, you didn't tell me your name as yet. My name is Jasmine. You're angry, I am sure you won't ask my name but I will still tell you. My name is Jani, Mr. Jani. I know your name now, will you please send my mobile phone to my address? It's your mobile phone, you come to my address. No, I can't. In that case, you won't get it. Jani, please. - Good girl. Come to Ocean Carnival Park tomorrow morning in blue jeans and red top. What about my mobile phone? Don't forget to come in red top and blue jeans. Hey! - Fantastic! Jani. Why are you surprised? I am Jasmine. I don't know who you are. Stop bothering me. She was right here, where did she go? Mr. Jani. I am not able to believe you're Jasmine. Mr. Jani, give me your mobile phone. My mobile phone... Why? - Give it. Hello. - Hello. I am Jasmine speaking. I am here to meet you but somebody has started bothering me. Where are you? I am right behind you. Step aside. Stop annoying me. Where are you? Turn to your right. I am right before you. Are you Jasmine? Do you still have a doubt? I am still not able to believe. Then how do I make you believe? Just a minute. One doesn't need to be educated to find out if you're telling truth, an illiterate like me is enough to do that. If you pass in this test... I knew you were Jasmine as soon as I saw you but I still wanted to confirm the same. It was I who performed action but why are you reacting? Any problem? Hello! Hey! What happened? Those men are chasing me. Oh. You go upstairs, I will come. Go. Who's that? "You..." I was... Jani. Jani. Jani. Diana! What... Don't you have the manners to knock the door before you enter a bachelor's house? Oh, my God. You talk about restrictions though I am an old woman but I don't think that girl knocked the door before entering your house. Jani, I have a doubt. - Yeah, proceed. That girl was shaken when she came but when she left, she was feeling shy. What did you do by which she felt so shy? I did nothing to Jasmine but I think I have fallen for her. Jani, I hope you don't forget me. Come on, Daina. What is this? Love and affection is very important for a man to be happy. If Jasmine is love, you're affection. Oh, my child. But I doubt if Jasmine loves me. Oh, she doesn't love you. But seeing her feel shy I think she loves you too. How do I confirm that? Oh, it's very simple, Jani. Profess your love to her in the morning. That's all. Is that so? - Yes. Really? - Yeah, really. Jani. - Yes. You said you want to say something, why are you quiet? Tell me something. You said you want to say something, tell me what it is. You tell me first. I thought I will follow the rule 'Ladies First'. I don't know if you're breaking the rule or changing it but it's a nice change, I like it. I love you. Look Jasmine, I don't believe in social media, I believe in direct conversation. What do you say? Hello. You managed to impress her, Jani. Hello. I am talking so much, you're just sitting quietly. I just love to hear you talk. I don't know. You're something special to me. I have seen many guys but you're different of them all, which I can't express. You're so interesting. I want to know about your family. My family? I am still a bachelor. I mean, your parents. - I see. Look Jasmine, my past was miserable, you're my present, I've no idea about my future. I have decided to build a family. To be honest, ever since Joe has come into my life not for one single moment I felt I am orphan. The two of us are always together. So we're always there for each other. Whoever comes into my life, may it be anybody, Joe, will always be special to me. I love you, Jani. Jani, so far, it was just the two of you, hereafter, even I will be with you. Jani, you managed to nab her wisely, she is so beautiful. The two of you are made for each other. There's glue on the table, get up. - My God! Who kept the glue here? You people trouble me so much. I bought it to fix your shoes, sir. You're crossing your limits. I'll write to the head office and get you transferred to guard mortuary. Sir, I will guard your dog but not mortuary. Have you realized how powerful I am? - Yes, sir. Go get coffee and fritters. Pandu. - My God! Get bun for Jo. Okay, sir. - Go. You will surely be given night duty, on that night, I will do full duty in your house. Jani, did you see how miserable the life of policemen is? The government pays us salary to run the family but for the other expenses, I rely on you. If not for you... - I have decided to give up robbery. It was he who said that. I am glad you reformed. It was I who said that. You don't mean that, do you? My life will become miserable. Sir, at 9:03 AM today, I decided to give up robbery. Just 5 minutes back. - Yes. You've been a thief since the age of 5, you decided to give up robbery in just 5 minutes. What made you take such a big decision? What? I knew it. I knew it seeing you so well dressed but I never thought love would reform you so much. As a police officer, I am very happy that you reformed. Both of you stay blessed. Jani. Come, my child. Only love is not enough to make a living, you also need power. Money. That's true. Sir, I never used to think about future, I used to splurge the money I make in no time. But after hearing what you said, I think it will be difficult to make a living but I still won't commit theft. Very good. - I've promised Jasmine that I won't. Sir, you stood by me all this time, hereafter, you will continue to support both of us. I... How's it possible? - You must. Alright. You're young people, you do what you want but elders have to show patience. God does exist. Seems like Inspector Panduranga is trying to trick Jani. You idiot! Shut up! I have a good deal. Only you can handle it. Yes. My child, it's not robbery, it's a deal. If you do it, both of you can settle in life. I have found a good guy for Swati. I her father and I will find a guy for her. Not just being responsible, you also need money. Where will you get money from? Give me my share of property, my wife, my daughter and I will leave the house. Do that first. Seeing your brother's reaction, we're sure to get ruined. Do something about it. Sure. I have hatched a plan to finish my brother. Jesus, I have never asked You for anything. I am not demanding, it's my prayer to You. I want Jani to be with me until I breath my last. I was so pained when I learnt that I am an orphan. People who raised me trained me to become a thief, they lead me to a wrong path and I was then deeply pained. But today, I am very happy. Jani is the reason. Ever since Jani came into my life, I have reformed. We have decided to give up robbery. You can't take such a decision. Why not? Did Jani ask you to do so? It was my decision. It is my personal matter, stay out of this. Joe, she's my prey, come.. - Hi, Jasmine. What happened? Any problem? You're the problem. - What? What have I done? You didn't do anything, Jasmine is excited. Joe, I think we must leave them alone. Let's find a place to relax. What was so funny about it? You won't understand. I won't understand? Alright, tell me what you understood. You must understand that on your own. There won't be meaning in thing that doesn't make sense. but you say you have understood. Tell me what it is. You must understand that on your own, I won't tell you. Your fragrance drives me crazy. My God! Thrash him! Is there no electricity? Boss. - Yes. We've seen villains in dark only in movies that's why we put off the light. The one in the dark is an ordinary villain, the one in bright light with white attire is super villain. You have insulted a super villain by putting off the light. You idiots. - We're sorry, Boss. When people in Mumbai hear my name, the politicians in Vidhana Soudha tremble. Vidhana Soudha is in Bangalore. It doesn't make any difference. Hey! To build my empire in my native place Mangalore I have taken up my first contract of killing but you ruined it. Why did you do that? Boss, we nabbed him, when we were about to cut his throat with saw, he said, 'The saw is not sharp' and went to sharpen it. But he didn't came back with the saw, am I right? How did you know, Boss? I came to Mangalore to build my empire having you guys but I have now realized that I won't be able to even catch a frog shell. No problem. There's success only after failure. At least handle the second deal properly. Bring it! Give it to me. Mirchi Boss! Do you know why I am so hot? Do you know why I am like this? Hot red chilli! Anybody would speak up if they eat it. Eat it! - Sir, please let me go! Please spare me. Should I spare you? That's impossible. You have made a grave mistake, if I spare you, I don't deserve to be alive. Am I right, Chang? So are you a dead body? You people were guarding cemetery but I employed you, I deserve to be a dead meat. Sir, what's my fault? Do I have to say what mistake you have made? Do I have to say what mistake you have made? Please tell us, Boss. - Hey! I am a contract killer not betel nut seller. Both are same, Boss. They won't stay quiet unless I don't tell them. I will tell you. The owner of the hotel in which he used to work gave him rice to clean and left to buy lentil. By the time the owner returned, he eloped with his wife. Really, Boss? What happened then? - 'What happened?' No, I didn't elope with her. She came with me willingly. - It doesn't make any difference. Sir. - Yes. Torture me with baton, thrash me to pulp but don't shove red chilies, I am already suffering from piles. I have already accepted the contract to kill you but after hearing what you said both are equally at fault. But I can't do anything. Once I accept the contract, I don't cancel it at any cost. I am sorry. I am partially deaf. Get started. Nice sound but wrong place, wrong person. Hello. Mirchi here. Who's speaking? I want to talk to Mirchi Boss. Mirchi speaking. What's the matter? Well... - That's Indian tune, Do Re Mi Fa So La Ti. I am not a music director, I am a contract killer. Whom should I kill? I want you to kill my brother. Very nice. My third deal is to kill your brother. Nice. I must not go against my ethics. Any photo? It's quite heavy. How much? I accept the contract. He is finished. Joe! Joe, come here! Darn it! Jani, you have saved my life again. I am grateful to you. How will I repay your favor? Sir, I didn't do anything, it's Joe who's responsible for it. I must say, you were sent here by God. God will never let down those who do good deeds. I see God in you. I don't trust anyone. Please work for me. Sir, except that ask for anything else. If you don't mind, will you give me the rosary in your neck? The rosary? - Yes. Here you are. I will even lay down my life if you asked for it affectionately. Be careful, sir. Thank you very much, sir. - Welcome. Joe! Here you are. - Thank you. Thank you. - Welcome. Let's go. Hey! Shankar! Oh, my God! Let me go! It's Bajarangi Boys. Hello. - Boss, he is finished. How do we dispose the dead body? Take it to the exhibition in London. Please give me Rs. 100. What for? I will fill diesel in the vehicle and go to London. You idiots, you should be beaten with the slippers of mentally unstable people. Call me idiots but don't call mad. I am glad you realized that. - What are you talking about? If you don't stop posing questions at me, I will kill you. Sorry, Boss. I apologize to you. Please forgive us, Boss. I must forgive you because I won't find intelligent people for the petty money. Boss, add 1 rupee to Rs. 999 from the next month and pay us Rs. 1000. No, I can't. otherwise you'll have to pay a tax of Rs. 500. Is that so? In that case, we don't want salary. - That's great. Boss, what about the dead body? Dump it at the bridge in Gurupura. No one should find out. - Okay, Boss. Sir! Sir You're having a good sleep by ruining our sleep. Only politicians sleep well not police. Jani. - Yes. The deal is okay. Don't use bike in the deal. Sir, I have no other vehicle other than bike. I have an idea. Constable. Did you call me, sir? - No, scratch my armpits. He is right here, he's pretending as if he didn't hear me. Sir, calm down. Tell me. Give a vehicle to Jani, he needs one. We are idle, give him our jeep. Also give him police uniform and a whistle, he will perform our duty. Sir, don't try to act smart. Why don't you leave me alone? He is trying to confuse you by telling the couplet wrong. He is trying to confuse me. That shouldn't happen. I will catch him red-handed, tell me what he said. Sir, I will tell you on one condition. I accept your condition, tell me. Sir, if you let me out on parole, the rich man in our locality has gone out of town, I will meet with his wife and come back in the morning. You rascal! I ask for your help and how dare you say that to me. You rascal. - You did the same once. He said something again. What did you say? Sir, I was talking about him. His imprisonment will be extended by six months. Thank you, sir. Sir. - Yes. And what about us? Don't worry. - Sir. Yes. Do this. - Shall we steal a car? I am policeman too but I am not as intelligent as you. Never mind, go on. Sir. - Yes. Come close. Give him the car we seized yesterday in smuggling case. Constable, that's a great idea, you're such a darling. Stop posing like that, I am not that kind of man. I appreciated you for giving me a wonderful idea. Jani, take that car. - Okay, sir. What? There's a problem, sir. - Tell me. There's no battery in the car. Sir, what's my fault? The money you used to buy sari for your wife last week was the money we got by selling the battery. I thought only Batta was an idiot but you're an idiot too. Both of you are tarnishing my image Sir, tell me if you need something, your wife wants me to get brinjal soon. Brinjal? - Yes. Why will my wife ask you to get brinjal? That's your problem, sir. Darn it. It's my problem. Sir. Remove the battery from the police jeep and fix it in the car we seized. What about our jeep? The police department will get us a new battery. - Okay, sir. That's a wonderful idea, sir. Jani, if you're successful in handling the deal, you'll be rich. What about me? Krishna, you're my childhood friend, I won't disappoint you. I will get you the best tea stall in the town. Why are you so angry on me? I am an honest man, I don't cheat people by adulterating tea. I can't do that. That's impossible. I am happy with my profession. You're happy with what you have but have you ever thought about those who have lost their money? A have a beautiful girl like Jasmine in your life but I don't even have a girlfriend. I will think about my future when I find one. As of now, let's clean the car. People have immersed Lord Ganesh's idol in water then what is this rat doing in our car? Hello, step aside. "Jani disappeared." "He became rich." "He give up everything." "He has fallen in love." "He has fallen in love." What's that noise? Krishna, what's that noise? Jani, I think we have a flat tyre. Stop talking rubbish. Go and check. Sorry, I won't talk rubbish. Let's go, I am scared. I am not able to open the dickey, let's go, Jani. Get in. - My God. Sir, for how long will you torture me? You torture me all day long. My back is aching! - Hey! Idiot! I am worried because my men are back yet, just shut up. If you keep blabbering, I will break your head with ice and kill you. Don't annoy me. Did you dispose the dead body? I am talking to you. Did you dispose the dead body? You don't even allow us to eat, Boss. Bajarangi Boys, did you kill him? Whatever we touch... Turns into gold? - No, iron. I thought you were sending us to kill a strong man, whereas you... - Was he weak? No, he was weaker. We killed him easily. He may be a weak man but I doubt if you guys have done the job properly. Boss, if you have a doubt, consult a doctor. - Doctor? Mirchi, you have trusted them, you are finished. Tear his underwear and shove chilli. Let him be, Boss. We have killed him, will you get us beer? I am unable to believe what you say. Did you really kill him? Yes, Boss. My God! Did we hit him hard? - You've made such a strong promise, I believe you. Will you offer us liquor and meat, Boss? Along with liquor and meat, you also get this. Mirchi, you're done for. - Stop it! You're finished. Day 01, 10:55PM. Jani, there are no movies running in both the theatres, it is futile to buy tickets. Jani, there will be plenty of entertainment in the third theatre. Jani, there's no hero in this movie so the heroine is dejected. But Jani, though the hero forgets to have food... - Stop. Don't cross your limits, it's bad. What about people like me who yearn for romance? You must not think of romance. Am I right, Joe? You're right. Mirchi here. Who's speaking? My brother phone is ringing. Why did you call me if your brother's phone is ringing? Hang up the phone. Mirchi, if something goes wrong you and I will go to jail. I am busy, you go to jail. You were good to me when you accepted the deal, why are you being rude to me now? Who is he? Are you talking about prawn? I am talking about businessman Shyam Sundar. Both are same, tell me. My brother's phone is ringing. A phone does ring, what can I do? How will my brother's phone ring if you dumped his dead body in the river? I don't trust you. Hey! Your brother is dead for sure, as long as his mobile phone is concerned, it will ring until the battery gets drained and it will go off. Sir, I wouldn't have minded if you doubted my weight, you doubted my height. Sir, I belong to Hitler's family, we don't give up until we accomplish our mission. People like you won't understand. Mister, I really couldn't understand what you said. Turn off the phone and go to sleep. What are they doing? Hello? I am Panduranga speaking. I am Sudhakar Shetty speaking. Sir, greetings. What is the matter? Shyam Sunder is missing since last night. His car was found in your area limits. Did you enquire about it? Sir, I've taken the car in custody. Sir, I'm enquiring. You have to trace out this case soon. The one who's gone missing is my best friend. Sir, within 24 hours Panduranga will solve this case. Thank you, officer. There's Shyam Sunder's profile detail file in our party office. You can collect it from there. - Okay, sir. Keep me posted about the investigation. This is not an order, but consider it as request. Okay, sir. Bhatt! - Yes, sir. Get the jeep. We have to go out. Let's go. Why are you looking as if you've got lost? Let's go. - Sir. I will get the jeep, but you'll have to lock the station. Lock? Why? Shetty and I will push the jeep and you'll drive it. - Yes. How can we all leave? There's no lock for the prison. Yes. Be precise. I don't understand anything. Sir, there's no battery in our jeep. Bat... What are you saying? Did anyone steal the battery from a police jeep? Rascals! What were you doing? Were you doing duty or repairing the electric pole? He is speaking nonsense. What are you murmuring? Say it loudly. - Sir, you put the battery in Jani's car. Is it? - Yes. You're a nice guy. - Okay, sir. You're my favorite disciple. Okay, sir. Give me the phone. I don't have currency. I think I'll have to cancel outgoing service from my phone. I can never forget Jani's number. Jani! I don't know where Shyam Sunder is. Jani, stop the car. I will get the file, you wait here. Greetings, sir. - Greetings. Here. He is the hero of the movie 'Rati Vighnana'. Okay, thank you. Jani. - Shall we leave, sir? Hey, okay. Why is he upset? He asked for mutton bones in the morning. I told him that I'll get it for him in the evening. So, he is upset. - Oh, poor fellow. In this silent ocean, in the deep ocean, shall we play hide and seek? Jani, when you started talking, I thought you'll get the award. - Oh. But you, you proved it. - Thank you, sweetheart. At least you understood me. - What? I didn't get you. I myself don't understand what I say, how can you? Forget it. When will you give what I asked for.? What? Don't joke. I had asked for something. I am still waiting to get it. Oh. Jani is in the mood to take. But Jasmine is not in mood to give it. Jasmine, if you don't give, I will become a Father. If you become a Father, I'll become a Sister. No, Jasmine. Please don't say such things. I bind you with my oath. Jani, why did you become serious? I was just kidding. Jani, do you love me so much? For Jani, Joe and Jasmine are his life. Jani, sir is calling you. I will come. - Okay. Jasmine, I have some work. I will be back. You take care. Joe. 'Day 02, 09:50 AM' Sir, I would've come had you summoned me. Move back. About turn and go forward. I was just passing by. I saw you, so... What's the matter? - There is. Tonight in the Mangalore carnival, you should finish your deal. Tonight? - Yes. You should be very careful. Coast guard security is very tight. If this deal is done.. If this deal is done, we both can settle in life. Thank you. The one who's missing, I am going to his house for investigation. I will take the bike. You take the car. Okay, cool. Yeah. Wow! Rascal, pumpkin grown on the ground, not on the tree. Come. - Pumpkin? It is grown on the ground. - You go. 'Day 02, 11:20 PM' The mobile is ringing. Boss, mobile is bound to ring. When you don't know this, how did you become the boss? I became a boss after writing IAS exams. How can anyone become a boss by writing IAS exams? You know about this, how? Just like that, Boss. I beg of you, tell me where did you throw him after murdering him? Boss, we didn't murder him. Murder... Hey, where did you throw him without murdering him? Boss, you joke nicely. I am not joking. I am very serious, I swear by my father. There's no water in my body, if I had it, four bottles would've come out as tears. Tell me how did you murder him. Boss, we killed him not murdered him. God, I am a very experienced man. These scoundrels are irritating me... Boss, will you drink soda? Give it to me. Where did you get this from? - Just like that, Boss. Is it? You scoundrels, tell me correctly. How did you murder him, tell me. - Boss, don't get tense. You want to know how we disposed the dead body, right? Even I have been asking the same thing again. Speak up. Boss, we'll tell you. Look at us. Oh. Oh. Superb. This range was excellent. Very good. Murder was okay, but why didn't you dispose the dead body yet? Boss, we need four people to dispose the body. Hey, it is me. Oh no! I like your surprise. 'Welcome to Panambur Beach Carnival.' 'In some time, there will be a dance program by Mohak Tare, Malnad Myna and...' Jani, the stage is so huge. I am excited to see the beautiful girls dancing on the stage. Jani, will you give me my share in this deal? When did I tell you that I'll give you a share? - What? Jani, you can lie to me, but if you cheat me, I will ruin myself. 'Everyone be alert.' 'Look away from Mayna.' Sir, I was waiting for your call. Jani, don't finish the deal today. Why? What happened? Coast guard have learnt about our deal. Sir, what do we do now? Leave the place. Okay. Jani, is the deal done? No deal. Hope you're not joking. Coast guard have made our lives miserable. Jani, we couldn't drink, can we at least go inside and enjoy the dance program? Hey! Sorry, my associates are new learners, but they have a DL, do you want to see? Sorry. Sir, forget it. A human is to err. He is a nice man. Had you damaged our vehicle, you would've seen our real self. You stay quiet. Don't mind him, he jokes. - He's upset. Let's go. - But still, he is upset. Sir, actually what happened was... I think he's the director of Bengali movies. He is talking so much. Come, let's go and see the heaven. Bye, sir. - Okay, don't worry. Welcome, enjoy. Boss, they were talking about heaven. What does that mean? You fools, you rammed into his car, good that he didn't send you to hell. Boss is upset with us. 'Did he see the dead body?' Very nice dog. I like dogs. Oh. Sorry. This biscuit is for you. You want one more? Take it. Full. They forgot to close the trunk. Don't worry, I'll do it for you. 'Please come.' Come on, Bajarangi Boys. You leave now. Come tomorrow morning. Okay, sir. Wasn't she beautiful? - Yes, indeed. I would've taken her... - What? I would... Hello? Sir, tell me. Jani, where are you? - I am near the carnival. If you don't have any problem, will you come home? I want to talk to you something important. I'll be there in 10 minutes. Krishna, you take Joe home, I'll be back in some time. - Okay. Okay, bye. Mr. Gowda, why did you call me here at this hour? Sir, I had to talk something to you. So, I came here. Mr. Gowda, we can talk in the morning. You leave. Politicians like us don't follow any time. You may think about timing, but not we. Tell me soon what you want to say. I have some other work. Sir, I have lot of work in the dark. But the reason I came here was... - Mr. Gowda, don't beat around the bush, come to the point. Sir, I am a fool. I made a mistake by beating around the bush. I should've come to the point. Seeing my dedication towards the party, I thought they would felicitate me. They did, but not me, you. Mr. Gowda, I didn't ask them to do it. The love of the people, and the party members trust on me, I couldn't refuse. I am planning to do something good after getting this post. That's all. Sir, do good. I am not stopping you, but it's a hindrance for me. Who is the reason for this? Just once if you stand before the mirror, the mirror will reply to your question. You are trying to tell that I am a fraud. No problem, sir. I will endure everything you say because, you are the leader of our party. Even if I don't respect you, I'll have to respect your position. Mr. Gowda, politics shouldn't become a reason to make money. Sir, we wear simple clothes in politics is to earn money. People like you won't understand. Mr. Gowda, I don't think what you say is right. Sir, I can't help it. Mind your language. I am minding my language till now. If we continue to talk we will not end till morning. So, one of us have to stop talking. That is you. Sir? Sir? Stop here. Yes, thank you. Hold him. 'The number you're calling...' Sir? He asked me to come, but where did he go? Dad? Yes. Dad? Dad. Dad. Dad? Jani pushed me and came inside. Sir, did he kill you? Oh no. Sir, Jani killed you. I told you not to mingle with him. I had warned you. You trusted him so much. He killed you, sir. Sir, I won't spare Jani. Dad, what happened? Forgive me. Forgive you? - Yes. Why? When you said you'll give up robbery, I didn't understand you and hurt you. I might not be your father, but you're more than a daughter to me. I am a sinner father who asked you to rob people and ruined your life. Dad, that bad time has passed. That's a gone story. It's late, you go to sleep. You forgave me, that's your quality. But that God will never forgive me. Dad, don't worry unnecessarily. You don't worry about me. I may die anytime now. But God showed mercy on you because of your goodness. This much money? This is just advance money. Advance? - Yes. For what? - You've got a job in the ad company. They've given 1 lakh as advance. They'll give you 3 lakhs more once the work is done. You won't get such opportunity again. Even I am old now. I don't have anyone in this world other than you. Please don't refuse. But... - Jasmine, like you think, if you want to live happily with Jani, you have to agree. Jani is a very nice boy. I will pray for you both to be happy. But you have to leave for Mumbai tomorrow. Mumbai? Yes. This company is in Mumbai. Go to sleep now. You have to wake up early tomorrow. 'This number can't be reached at the moment, please call later.' Hello? Jani, I was trying to reach you last night. Your phone was not reachable. Where were you? I had some work, I had gone out. So, it would've been not reachable. Why are you tense? I have good news. - What is it? I've got a job in an Ad company as a model. Jasmine, it is not April. It is May. What's the connection between May and I getting a job? I am trying to say that you can't fool me and say it was 'April Fool'. You are a fool, who can fool you? If you get upset with me, how can you live life with me? Jani, I'll hang up if you talk unnecessarily. Okay. You've got a job as a model. What next? I am going to Mumbai. Mumbai? - Yes, Jani. My shoot is in Mumbai. Jani, the company has paid me 1 lakh rupees advance. Once I finish the shoot, they'll pay me 3 lakhs. You give up your illegal activities. I will earn money and take care of you. What do you say, Jani? Jani, what happened? When are you leaving to Mumbai? Now. The car is waiting outside. Now? - Yes. Jasmine, I'll be there in 10 minutes. No, Jani. I can't wait until you come, I have to leave. Listen to me, please. You can tell me when I return after three days. Bye. Love you. - Dear, we're getting late. - One moment, dad. Jani, I am leaving. See you. - Hello? Hello, Jasmine. Take care. - Okay. Here. Jani! I am already tense. Jani, wake up. See the newspaper. Krishna, why are you irritating me early in the morning? 'Sudhakar Shetty dies of heart attack'. Hey! I spoke to him last night on the phone. He was fine. Okay, you take Joe out, I'll go to his house. - Okay. Ma'am, Jani is here. I am Sudhakar Shetty's daughter, Aishwarya. I am Jani. I know. My father has told me about you on the phone. How did he die? I don't know. I returned home from UK yesterday. When I entered... But one thing is true, there's some reason behind my father's death. That's not heart attack. I have the same doubt. Because you father was attacked thrice before this. I know you saved my dad all the three times. Everyone is waiting. Jani, I wanted to talk to you in detail about dad. Please, will you meet me in the evening? Sure, anytime. I will be at the harbor. Hey, what are you doing? Hey, why are you doing drama? Hey, girl! Touching is the first step in business. If you fail in the first step, 1 lakh given to your father will go waste. Didn't your father explain it to you? When will you give the remaining 3 lakh rupees? Come on, let's go. Stop the car. Hey! Ma'am, I can only console you, but can't share your pain. Please don't cry. This is my dad's medical report. I met my father's personal doctor. He said he was totally fit and fine. They published in the newspaper that he suffered heart attack. I can't believe it. Ma'am. - You can call me Aishwarya. Like you said, your dad didn't die of heart attack. It was a murder. - My father didn't harm anyone, he always used to help the poor. Why was he murdered? I can't believe it. - Politics is such. No one can understand it. I understand only one thing, if somebody benefits by your father's death, it is Mr. Gowda. As I know, Mr. Gowda always wished to become the leader. But party members elected your father as leader. He even wished to contest for MP seat in upcoming elections. Your father got that seat too. Gowda was always nice to your father, but I could see anger against him on his face. Your father got saved thrice because of the good work he did. But this time, the enemy was close, but he couldn't recognize them and lost his life. What Gowda said and you said, I am confused. I want to find my father's murderers and get them punished. I need your help. Aishwarya, in this matter, I will always support you. Take care. Bye. Krishna, I am feeling very low today. That means you're planning to get drunk in Mangalore Muniyamma's hut. Jani, you should've given this expression yesterday, not today. Because after a month I had bath with Dove shampoo. Men should get thoughts, not doubts. Because of doubt, Goddess Sita had to undergo fire test. That's okay. Why is the car stinking so much? Joe, no one can beat you in reaction. Jani, after you said, even I can smell something very lightly. 'At least now open the trunk.' 'The dead body will wake up because of the smell.' 'I think there's a dead rat in our car.' 'Let's check.' Jani, there's a body in our car. - Why are you screaming? He? Krishna, he's the hero of the movie that we saw at home that day. Jani, though he had an AC apartment to sleep, why is he sleeping in our car? He's not sleeping. Somebody murdered him and put him here. - Murder. Murder! Idiot, don't scream or we'll land up in jail. Jani, what do we do with this dead body? Krishna, this is the right place. Jani, my body is shaking. - You stay quiet. Pick him up. He is so heavy. How are you managing to pick him? 1, 2, 3! Body. The mobile is ringing. Don't tell me that a mobile is bound to ring. What state I've come to. I would fool everyone in Mumbai. You made me eat bun after coming to Karnataka Mangalore. Boss, you didn't tell us that you had buns. Idiots, seeing your honesty towards me, I think I'll have to even tell you that morning I defecated. Does worm has eyes? Do you know what it means? Boss, won't we know? We failed in 1st standard. You tell me what does it mean? - Boss. I know you're talking about berries on the trees. Hey! I'm not talking about fruits. I am talking about defecating. - Boss, both are same. If I take you to give testimony, you will fix a bed for me in NIMHANS. NIMHANS means mental asylum, right? How do you know that? Just like that, boss. Tell me correctly, where did you dispose the body? Turn around and move forward. Move forward. - Left, right. Hey, why did you keep the body in the car? Boss, this is not a body, it is a dummy. Dummy? - Demo with dummy. Demo? Dummy? Explain it to me correctly. Boss, that day we committed a murder. That was not a murder. You killed him. - No, boss. That is a murder, this is killing. Idiots, you change your statement like you change undergarments. What is it? Tell me. Boss, did we commit murder or killing? If you confuse me, I will commit suicide. Boss, please don't. - Leave me. Boss, you're our leader. - You're our care taker. Get up. Idiots, you love me more than my siblings. You have not just touched my heart, but kissed it. Boss, I'll go and piss. Hey, do that later. First tell me where did you dispose the body. Speak up! - Okay, boss. Hey, there are two bodies here. Boss, one is body and another is dummy. It was not here earlier, how did it come now? Boss, shall we call the police and inform them about it? Idiots! Scoundrels. It's waste that I nurtured you all. If I call from my mobile, won't the police trace me? Let's look for a coin booth. Boss, that's the reason we call you as boss. - Yes. Follow me. "Sevanti." - Sir. "Wear flowers on your head." Pandu. - Yes. Sir! Pandu, do you think I came here to join duty? No, I have come here to extend my leave for a month more. Why sir, aren't you feeling well? If I join the duty in this condition, my other duties will finish. Like gun is important for a policeman, a girl is important for this groom. Sir, who's getting married? Bhatt, I am getting married. If you miss my wedding don't miss my child's naming ceremony. Sir, who was with you in your quarters? That was LL, this is DL. Sir, you're great. Pandu, sit. Come on, sit. - No, sir. Thank you, sir. - Until I return, you are the inspector of this station. It is you. Thank you, sir. Sir, were you dreaming? It's good for health. Sir, answer the phone. Hello, is this police station? No, it is railway station. - Sorry, wrong number. If you dial 100, you'll reach a police station. What do you want? Everything is over. Shall I hang up? Hello sir, there's a body lying under the Gurupura bridge. The body will wake up later. How can a dead body wake up? Dead body? - I was talking about a dead body, not money. Close your mouth. Sir, what is your name? I'm telling you that someone is dead and the name is very important to you. If you come soon, you'll get the body. If you come late, you won't even get the dead body. Is it okay? Sir... In the mornings we have to guard deceased Shetty's house and in the evening we have to guard the dead body. Tell Jani to get the car key. Sir. - Yes. The car is ready. Take it. I am irritated. - Sir, what happened to you? Why are you tense? - There's a body lying under the Gurupura bridge. Hi Joe, did you eat? 'If I say, I didn't, will you buy me food?' - No. Hey, let's go. Sir, I am not well. My heart is racing. Racing? - Yes, sir. Your heart won't race, but you'll pee in your pants. I will thrash you. Shetty, how are you feeling? - Sir, I am absolutely fine. I will come with you. - Okay, come on. Bye, Joe. I'll buy you lunch next time. All the best, sir. It's not even an hour we threw the body, it's become famous. Shetty troubled us for so many days. After he died, his daughter is making me crazy. I thought I would kill Shetty and blame Jani for it and hit two birds with the same stone. I made Shetty's daughter believe that Jani killed your father. Even after I said all this, Shetty's daughter is getting close to Jani. What I fear is, Shetty would've told something to Jani before he died. Did Shetty's daughter learn something about us? She was showing him some file. Brother, why are you getting tense? You don't worry. Give me one day, then you'll be the party president and you will be the MP candidate. Wait and see, how I kill Jani. You don't worry. I will even kill Shetty's daughter. Cheers! Hey, go. You can run your business somewhere else. Thank you, Boss. Bajarangi Bhai! - I escaped. I am so tense that even if you keep the Himalayas on my head, I won't get cooled down. Go. Bajarangi Bhai. - Boss. Come here. All our scores are settled today. I am going to Mumbai and get settled. You go to your respective villages and get settled. Take the money. Boss, we don't want money. That day you said that we'll have to pay tax if we take money. We don't want money. Your love is enough for us. 'I don't know where was the body for two days.' Hurry up. We're getting late. Take her carefully, women are very strong. Men are very weak. What is the case? Sir, he was roaming in the bus stop at night. So, I brought him. Where are you from? - Jharkand. I don't care what your name is, where are you from? Jharkand, sir. You idiot, you're telling me your name... - Sir, he is from Jharkand. Jharkand is a place? What kind of a name it is? I thought it was your name. Oh, Jharkand. Change the name of the place. Jani. - Yes, sir. Why have you come here early? Shetty, give him the car key. - Sir, I'm not here for the car. I guarded the dead body last night. I am tired, I can't talk to you. What is it? I've been trying to call Jasmine. She is not answering the call. I... I see. You're suffering from love illness. It keeps haunting you day and night. Sir, I've seen in TV and newspapers that girls forget the past once they enter film line. - No. Jani and Jasmine are like Aishwarya Rai and Abhishek Bachchan. Don't worry and spoil your health or there will be a problem in business. Okay? I'll go home and freshen up. Okay, sir. 'Jani is the savior of my life.' 'He is the man who saved my life thrice.' 'Even if he was a thief by profession he is a self-respected guy and didn't desire for money.' 'My favorite people in my life are, my wife, daughter, and Jani.' 'Until now I had only my wife and daughter.' 'But now Jani is in my life.' 'Jani stole my heart.' Jasmine! - 'What happened to you?' Nothing. Hello? - Jani, I'm Jasmine speaking. Jasmine? Jasmine, I've been trying to call you since yesterday. It's switched off. I am worried for you. Where are you? Hello? Hello Jasmine, talk to me. Jasmine, why are you quiet? Talk to me. Hello? Jasmine, you're crying? Why are you crying? What happened to you? What happened, Jasmine? Jani, my father told me that I've got a job and he sold me to Mumbai red light area. But I escaped from there. Okay, where are you now? I'll come there. Where are you? Jani, don't worry. I am in Udupi. I'll come there. Jasmine, I can't live without you. Please don't leave me alone. Jani, I don't have coins. I'll talk to you after I reach. Okay. But please, soon after you come, we both will get married, Jasmine. Jasmine, will you give me one kiss before we get married? Jani, I'll kiss you many times after we get married. Jani. Diana? What is this? Jani, I heard everything. How can you get married without informing me? Do you think marriage is a joke? Have to print the invitations and invite everyone. Food, decoration, jewelry, that can happen only if you this money. How can I accept it, Daina? You said this money was for your son who is in abroad? I can't accept it. I am unmarried, how can I have a son? Diana, why did you lie to me? For your love. For you. Not just that, I will get your wedding suit stitched. You say you're getting married today. I will get the suit for you. Diana, I don't want a suit. Actually, it doesn't suit people like us. This is not Jani's wedding, it is Diana's son's wedding. Don't refuse to wear suit. I bind you with my oath. You have to wear the suit that I get for you and go to the church. Okay. Hello Aishwarya, tell me. Jani, I wanted to talk to you urgently. Can you meet me? Oh, what a coincidence? Even I wanted to talk to you. Okay, will you come to the harbor? I will wait for you. Sure. I'll be there in 10 minutes. See you soon. Don't come close. If you step forward, I will kill her. Jani, save me. Please save me. Please. Don't come forward. I am not joking. I will kill her, Jani. You killed my innocent father. You did a drama of helping me find my father's murderer. You killed my father, so you have to die. Ma'am, you made a mistake. Jani? 'We all have gathered here and pray to You.' Amen. Jani. Jani, why are you sleeping here? Like I said, I bought a suit for your wedding. Wear this. Oh, are you feeling shy that we are here? Okay, I will turn to the side, you wear it. Why are you quiet? Speak up, Jani. Jani, speak up. Jani! Jani! You've come now? Please come, my son Jani is getting married. You should leave after having food. Okay, everyone please come. Jani! No! 'After one year' 'In ever loving memory, Jani. Born - 6-6-1992, died - 5-5-2016' 'Love can be erased when it is on paper.' 'It can be broken when it is etched on stone when it is inscribed on a heart.' 'It will remain forever. William Shakespeare.'
