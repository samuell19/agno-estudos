This movie was produced in cooperation with the International Foundation for Filmculture, Tokyo. Please come and try... our nutrtious healthy drink 'Akajiru'! Come and try! Free samples for the 'Akajiru' health drink! Please try some! No One's Ark (Baka no Hakobune) Dad, for starters give me... an advance. Eh? That is... - I mean, for the stores. - Oh... Ideally... in supermarkets and stuff... The product should be sold by large chains. But we'll start off small. Without word-of-mouth advertising, no success. And... Housewives love healthy food. That's why it has to be sold at supermarkets. Oh, wrong. That comes later, what I meant was... - I've forgotten, what was it? - Drugstores. Oh yeah, drugstores. We'll start off at drugstores and see how that goes. Right? Yes. But... wait a second... Huh? What's wrong? Isn't it plausible? Here's the coffee. Daisuke, don't you want to introduce her to us? Ah... I'm Hisako Shimada. - Did the boat see-saw alot? - Yes! I got all wet. - Do you want to take a shower? - No thanks, really I'm fine. - In the evening then? - Yes, thank you very much. Let them try it. It stinks. But the nutritional value is very high. These five drugstores to start with? And we have in stock... How much do we have? We have 20 now. 80 more will come later. - So 100 then? - Yes. Ah, I see... That makes 20 per store. That's not bad, right? Are you calculating the costs? The amount, including productions. Yes, I am. Oh, I almost forgot... We opened one already. Yeah that's right. We only have 99 then. That was close. Hisako, you're great! Should I go with 99 then? Yes... Wait, we could use some more as samples. Let's say 90. 9 more for samples should be enough. Will we stop by at some stores today? Yeah... Huh? Yeah. I have a cousin. Her name is Akiko Sakai, but since she married her family name's Omura. She works at the same company as my father. In the food-industry. But just here in the province. We should go there anyway. It won't help much at first. But it's good if she gets to know us, for when this thing starts rolling later. That's why we should introduce ourselves. Are we going now? Yes, as soon as possible. We should check out as many as possible today. Yeah. What's that big package? Don't know. It's from Daisuke. Huh? Let me see. What's he going to do with that, anyway? - No idea... - I'm going to see Akiko. What's this? Oh, the goods have arrived? Leave it there. - What about this? - As I said, just leave it there. See you later. I understand what you want. But it's totally utopian. You think so? I've got nothing against people who want to fulfill their dreams. You rarely meet that kind of person nowadays... It's cool. Yeah... I used to be just like you until recently. Had a dream, didn't think it through properly... Just did my thing. But you have to think about it carefully. This kind of unrealistic day-dreaming won't get you very far. Life's hard. Yeah, but still... I mean... It might sound harsh, but you haven't really thought this through. It's just too chaotic. Get off that thing already! Get off! What is it? Do you know why I'm pissed off? Sit down. Think about today's workday. How does it make you feel? The meeting with your parents and Akiko? Yeah, what did you think about it? It's hard to say after only one day... Do you think you worked today? If you ask me... No, you didn't. Well... What do you mean "well..."? You got nothing else to say? Like what? You should know that yourself. You said, today we'll just stop by and talk to people... "You said..." Yeah, that's what you said. That's why I thought, we wouldn't have to do anything else. So you haven't done anything yet? Maybe not... Damn it! How will we continue tomorrow? You ask me? You're the one from around here, not me. That's no answer to my question. I asked you several times in Tokyo, how we should handle things over here. - No you didn't. Never. - Yes I did! At the bus stop. I said several times, that we should go through all the steps. Plan everything out. Maybe, you asked me that. But our methods didn't help at all in Tokyo. We just have to try our luck here, without a plan. - That's what we talked about. - Yeah, sure, we did. The terms and conditions are different here. Of course, this dump is nothing like Tokyo! - "Dump" doesn't sound too nice. - Come on, it's true, right? If you think so... go ahead. Okay, this province is totally different from Tokyo. - Also the people are different. - Yeah that's right. And in a place like this, you'll need "connections". - Well, it's a small town. - The relatives and stuff. Relationships, you know. Like with Akiko today? How should I put this... We'll introduce ourselves around here and then start building... How should I say... ...a "network"? That was our preliminary goal. Yes, that's true. That's why I can't do anything at this stage. Yeah... Yes, but... You want everything at once. We have all the time in the world. Yeah... It's true. At least I think it is. Yes... We only just arrived today. Yeah. Almost done? Yes. What are you doing? Oh, nothing. Thank you for the bath. - Did you find everything ok? - Yes fine, thanks. - Did you want to take a bath? - Hmm? Sorry... excuse me. Your father was angry, huh? No, no... he wasn't. Really, he wasn't. Oh, tomorrow I'll go to see an old class-mate, he owns a supermarket. - "Connections"? - Yeah, the "Network". Finished. So you used to play the bass? Are you still good at it? Yeah, sure. Really? - Want me to play? - Yeah, yeah! Oh, great! I'm just holding a bass. It's not that exciting. What can you play? For example "Seikima II" and stuff like that. Wow, amazing! How long did you play? Since 7th grade... - For about three years. - Oh, three years. Wow, cool. Daisuke, you'd better try it somewhere else. I think it's pointless. - It's useless. Right? - No... You've got me wrong, Ozaki. We're not troubling you. Of course you are! Sorry, I meant... I don't want to cause you any problems. You should only take it on commission. Please take a look at this. "Healthy Life Corporation". We've been in business with "Healthy" for two years. At a great rate, ok? Ah... ah... Yes, and why...? Because the products are 100% identical! - Oh... - Don't you understand? We don't care. I'm not talking about you. We'll have a big problem. They even come to check every week. And once a month there's a PR-campaign in front of the store. - And it's going well? - Of course it is. But that's not the point, that doesn't matter at all. The point is... When they come and... um, what was that called again? - Akajiru. - When they see "Akajiru", they'll be upset. I have a question... So, the people from "Healthy" will come once a week. - Which days do they usually come? - Wednesdays. - Wednesday? - Yes, Wednesday. Then I have a proposition... So they come Wednesday, so we could take "Akajiru" off the shelves on Wednesdays... and then put it back on the other days, is that possible? No way. Absolutely not. Think about it! First, that's too complicated. Second, you don't respect my opinion. Third, this is Ozaki Supermarket! That's totally impossible! I understand you, but... We have banners and stuff! I don't care if you made banners or not. It's fundamentally problematic. Understood, Daisuke? You only came, because you wanted something from me. Only because we know each other. Well, that's clear to me. Only, because we know each other? What? What do you mean? Sorry, I said it wrong. I meant, only because we are acquainted. What are you doing there? Hey, what the...? What do you think your doing? What are you doing?! Huh? Stop it! You'll break it! So what? Get out! - Get the hell out! - You asshole! Madoka Kobayashi? Daisuke? Is it you? Yes. Are you back? Oh... yeah. Well... see you. Yeah. Who was that? Oh... an old school friend. For a long time... I've really liked you. Yeah... I like you. Ah... I see. Thanks. I have to go in the other direction. This is... for you. For your birthday. Eh? Oh, thanks. Well, open it. Okay. I... didn't know, what I should buy. Thank you, very cute. Yeah. Boss! Is this a new species? Those are just rocks! Come here! Come on! We are here to discover new species! These aren't new species. Just some stupid rocks! That proves, none of you are focused on your work. Hey! It takes me weeks to discover a new species. Concentrate properly! Or are you only here to hang around, you lazy punks? More focused, please! Oh! I'm coming. "Tracy Rose, Massage Parlor" Madoka? Hey, Madoka. Veronica. Yes? Do you remember Daisuke? You mean Daisuke Sakai? So you remember him. Right, you were together. Did you have something going on with him? I saw him yesterday. Really? Why do you ask? No reason. Did you hear? His "Akajiru"? You mean "Aojiru" (cod-liver)? No, no, it's really called "Akajiru". Like usual he's up to nonsense. Yes... Yeah, so that's how it is... Well, ok then... I'll talk to my wife. Such nonsense.... must be stopped before it even starts. Yes absolutely... Well, thanks for telling me. - I'm going now. - Okay. - Good Morning. - Morning. Morning. Good morning. Thirteen. Quick! - Here, a six! - You! What? Let me see... Why don't I have a...? - Come on. - Winner! I lost again. But why? I still have so many left. I play better, when I bet. Well then let's bet. - Yeah, let's bet. - Let's bet? Okay. Okay then. The loser gets... a year's supply of "Akajiru". - The winner, right? - No, the loser. As punishment. Punishment? But "Akajiru" is for winners! - "Akajiru"? - It's for the winner. It's our product. What? But... It's to be sold. What am I going to do with a year's supply? Drink it? This is Sakai, hello? Hello, Akiko. That means, Akiko's company wants to buy? We only spoke shortly on the phone. We'll see when we get there. Should we have taken more goods? And if we don't have enough now? Hmm, then what? Yeah... It's gonna be fine. "JH Foods" "Daisuke Sakai" What's going on? Look, this is for you. What about "Akajiru"? That's your uniform. You'll start working here from tomorrow. I talked to the supervisor. You come back, and then this...! What will people think? I don't get it. Listen to your father. But I'm asking you, Akiko! - Listen...! - What? Your father and I talked about this. For now you'll work here. You can still sell "Akajiru" afterwards. You'd better stop. - What did you say?! - You heard. Your father told me, that you are 5 million yen in debt. What do you think about that, Hisako? Umm, well... - With "Akajiru" I'll get the money back. - When will that be? That's not the kind of money you're able to pay back quickly. Am I right? You should work here first and pay back your debts. And then we'll think about the next step. That would be smart. If you work hard, you can keep living with your parents. I guess soon you both also want to...? Just don't marry in debt! Do as he says for now. I'll help you, also with "Akajiru". In this fucking place? I'd rather die! You...! Hey stop it! Father! Daisuke! I understand what you say... But... You don't even give Daisuke a chance. And you're totally right with that... I mean, not right! Huh? I'm running barefoot through the white sand... following you. Up in the endless blue sky, I see your picture. Because of you, my heart's shaking. Because of you it pounds strongly. So close to your ear, you can hear it... Ah, life is just a dream... I feel like I'm in a movie... Ah, one day something will happen. God, please let this dream come true. The whole night I wrote this love letter for you. I hide it in my shoe-box... to protect it from the rival's jealous glances. I'm your only angel. When you turn around, I see myself in your eyes... While I'm looking down, my heart pounds so strongly... Oh, life is just a dream. I feel like I'm in a movie... Ah, one day something will happen. God, please let this dream come true. My heart is beating faster, faster. My heart is beating faster, faster. Pounding so strongly, struck by your love. We'll take a shower. - Hello. - Hello. Hi, I'm Veronica. What are you doing here? Did Ozaki tell you? I already knew. Really? How are you, Madoka? Here I'm called "Veronica". Melts on the tongue, right? Yeah right... tongue... Take off your clothes. - Your pants as well. - Oh, yeah. Spread your legs. Weren't you in Tokyo? Yeah, but I came back. And you? What are you doing? Just work. You had this job in Tokyo aswell? That's right. Do you want to undress me? What? You can undress me... if you want. Well, then... Get this off first. Ah, velcro. - I'll put this here. - Yeah. You have to pull it down. - Ah, a zipper. - Yeah. - Now the back. - What? Ah, the bra... I'll start with kissing then, ok? Yes. Your leaving already? Yeah. Are you busy? Yeah, umm... My sister bought a turtle at a festival. - I have to feed her something. - Oh, I see. It doesn't eat much... Okay. - What will we be doing tomorrow at sports? - Training for the marathon... Hey! Ozaki is about to cum! Quick! Take him to the bathroom! - And take Kawahata too. - Kawahata? Ah, come on. - Is the toilet free? - Yeah. But I can't get it up. Is Daisuke back? He must be sulking somewhere. Oh, jammed again. I'll do it. I'm good at it. Really? Here, wear these. Thank you. Why do you want to drop out of school? Without graduating you can't do anything It's already too late. Dad already called the school. Dad? Why him? Don't know. The parents have to do it. I asked him, and he did it. What's he saying about this? He was a little bit upset. But he said, I could drop out because I'm pregnant. Oh yeah? He stayed really calm. You should have an abortion. No. Then don't go to Tokyo. But Taiki is waiting for me. Break up with him. No. If you want to go to Tokyo, then have an abortion. If you still want to go afterwards, I'll lend you the money. Okay? What has to be, has to be. I'm going to Tokyo. And I'm keeping the child. Excuse me. May I ask something? Do you know where Daisuke is? He disappeared a couple of days ago. I've been looking for him. But I don't know anyone around here, apart from you and him. Do you know where Daisuke could be? I'd be grateful for any hint. Where Daisuke could have gone or something, maybe you know... Please help me, Ozaki. Please... I'm busy! Are you blind? Can't you see I'm working! Look for him yourself. Really! Like I have the time... Ouch! that's hot. Here. Thanks. Well, this slap... Did you fight? You heard it? It was pretty loud. I don't want to interfere, but... I think I understand what your sister means. But she also went to Tokyo. I don't think going to Tokyo is the problem. She just thinks it's not the right time. But I'm pregnant... Might be stupid, but... there's something mystical about a child's birth. There's no way I could have an abortion. My boyfriend also says I should move in with him. But you need to graduate as well. Is that so important? Not necessarily, but... it would be smart. So people without diplomas aren't smart? No, but... - You are grown up. - Huh? "Love River Park" You must be cold? I'll drive you home. I'll keep looking for him. Didn't tell the old-one, I've left the store. Nevermind... I had to do the orders today... Damn... Ah, fuck it! I'll call him later and... Ah, whatever. You won! Get in! We'll drive by a couple of friends. What are you waiting for? Get in, we don't have time. No time to waste! Get in! Now! I could... No, that doesn't make sense. I hope he doesn't order crap. Ah, there's nothing to do about it now. I'm here now... I could clear things up with him afterwards. Yeah, that will be alright... So, and now? - That's up to you. - Got it. First we'll drive to Oka, it's only one hour to Yoshioka from there. Or 15 minutes, when I race. No, wait... Or Yoshioka first? Well, anyway. No guts, no glory. I'll do it my style, ok? Everything alright? Well, then here we go. Last time he performed with "Black Lamb" and "Yellow Cockroach". - Wow, with "Yellow Cock". - You know them? - Sure! What does he play? - Keyboard. - Wow, which genre? - Rock. Tell me when the CD comes out. Yeah, Sure. First stop! Get out! Anybody there? Anybody there? Anybody there?! Have you seen Daisuke? Who's that? - Ah, I mean Daisuke Sakai. - Oh, that Daisuke? Ah ok. Yeah, that one. Is he here? Isn't he in Tokyo? Yeah, he was in Tokyo, but he came back... Something happened a couple of days ago and now he's gone. Yeah, looks like that. Yes, and her? Who is she? Ah, that is... that is... Daisuke's... Are you his girlfriend? ...his girlfriend. - And what's your name? - Hisako Shimada. - Nice to meet you. - I'm Okazaki. I see... So? Did you two fight? Actually not. Just a little dispute. It's none of my business... but did you have anything to do with this dispute? Ozaki! Did you have anything to do with this dispute? Oh, me having anything to do with it... maybe that's possible. I have the order to look for him. We are looking together. - Nevermind... - I'll ask around my friends. - That's all I can do. - Thank you very much. You're welcome. So... if there's some news, shall I call? Ozaki! If there's something, I'll call you on your cell! Yes, on the cell. I've got the cell. Yeah, that... You can call me. Yes, the cell... Alright. We'll find him for sure. How many months pregnant are you? Around three months. That means... During summer vacation? In Tokyo? That's when you did it? That's where it happened? Is it moving already? No, not yet. As soon as important information... ah, information comes in, call immediately! Well.. Okay, yes. Got it. Thank you! Zero matches, damn. I'm sorry. No, I'm sorry. He disappeared completely. What now? I'm sorry, really... Don't worry... I'll take you home. We can still look while we're on the way. You ok? What? Why? - I really enjoyed it. - Thank you. Thank you, please come again! Of course I'll come again. Thanks. - Good morning. - Hello. - Excuse me... - Yes. We met at the vending-machine the other day... with the bicycle... Ah, that was you, with Daisuke? Yes. My name is Hisako Shimada. - What? - Hisako Shimada. Ah ok. I'm Madoka. And what are you doing here with Ozaki? Well... he's looking for Daisuke with me. - You're looking for Daisuke...? - Yeah. He's staying with me. Oh, really? Yes. Can I come with you? Chinatsu, where's Daisuke? Chinatsu, when's your sister coming back? If she had any idea... Oh yeah, I drink this too... this white stuff. What is it called again? No, stop it, please stop it... Wow! This is really great. After you. So nice! - Actually the apartment is really bright. - Really great! - Turn that thing off. - Sorry. - Just a prank-call. - Again? It's bigger than I expected. Isn't it? But when you have a child, it'll get too small. You're a funny one. You should buy an apartment. Now or never! The rates have dropped after the boom. I still can't afford it. Wow! The toilet and bathroom are seperate! That's nothing unusual in apartments made during the 60's. Oh really! So what do you think Daisuke? The phone cable is here. The office comes here. The living-area should be here in the bright room. - You think? - Yeah. - Okay, you decide. - But we wanted to make all decisions together. Compared to the one from yesterday... That one was terrible. It's really nice here... We have to think about it. What shall we do, Daisuke? - If you like it, let's go for it. - No! Not like that! But if we take this one, what are we going to do about the other estate agent? - Oh him... - Yeah. - Ah, that's ok. - It's ok, right? - So we take this one? - I can't decide... Take your time. Sorry about this. What do you think? - Again? - No, this time it's the other one. Oh, that. What's that? Oh, it's a... what's it called again? Tamagotchi. Huh? If you don't feed it, it dies. The gadget dies? Of course not. It's just a toy. It doesn't die. But it eats. See? I've never seen something like this. Interesting. Is this going to be the next big thing? This thing? Never! I'm going home... home. And that from yesterday...? What about yesterday? About the sale in front of the store... The sale... in front of the store. What? It is... not hopeless. Se... Selling in front of the store, yeah. - Mother! - Mmm? Can you apply the lotion? What? Do it yourself. But I can't reach there. Look, here. Not now. Dry your hands. Please. Ask Hisako. Mother, please! - Look, it's out already. - No, I'm busy. - Please. - Let Hisako do it. Well... no lotion today then. Thank you for the bath. Ah, Hisako. Could you help Daisuke apply the lotion? Hey... Why are you asking her? Daisuke, phone! Who is it? "Ozaki". Tell him I'm out. Come on, Daisuke! Tell him I'm not here! I'm taking it. - A friend? - Yes. Hello, Hisako? This is Ozaki. How are you? Sorry about this morning... That I threw up. No, I'm better now. And about the sale in front of the store... A friend of my father owns a drugstore. He thinks the idea is interesting. No, that's not... yes, yes. It would be best if you could come by. Yes, I see. How's Daisuke? Oh really? Nevermind! Let him be. I'll take care of the drugstore. So you'll just have to drop by. Call me afterwards, and tell me how it went. We can have a coffee. Ah, okay. I see. No, it's alright... If you're only going to hang around, visit the family grave at least. Daisuke! Hisako? Why don't you go together? Where? The grave. - The grave? - Yes, the grave. It won't light up. No way... Let me do it. It won't work like that. Put your hands around it. Not like that! Up! Up! No, not like that. Hold your hands correctly! Now you're blaming me! It's blowing from above. Is that my fault? Can't see. More like this. Thank you very much for your cooperation!

I suffered from constipation since I was born. But thanks to "Akajiru" I can go every day now. I even have a shiny complexion now. - Are any of you suffering from constipation? - No... - but I have a stiff shoulder. - It also helps with that! I'm really suffering from... constipation.

We'll ship... well, we'll ship the following day. I'll give you my card... Daisuke, can you take over? Let me... introduce the product to you. Do you have breakfast... I mean, do you eat breakfast everyday? - Do you also drink milk? - Yes, I do. If that's... if that's so, all you have to do is... take "Akajiru" instead of milk. Not only does it contain calcium... but on top of that also Vitamin A, B, and even C, D and E... The... wonder vegetable "Nvai", which 'Akajiru' is made of... How do you like it? But the food value is very high. How is it? No way , I can't drink it. But you should drink it, for your health's sake. - Would you like to take a brochure with you? - No, god no. Try "Akajiru"! Please come again! Come and try "Akajiru"! Please try! No sales. No need to count. Should we sell single packs? - It's useless. - What? - Too complicated. - Why?

Come and try it! Can I buy it in single packs? Five? Well, a pack of ten costs 2,500 Yen, but single packs cost 300 Yen. The package price is cheaper. Ten are too many for two people. No, for two people it's enough for 5 days. Do you sell them as single packs or not? Well the package-price is... So you're not? You don't sell singles? We get them as packages of ten so... Selling single packs just for you would be... everybody else bought the packages. Don't you sell singles? You should take it for at least a week. Like with all health products. So, it's not possible? As I said, it won't work if you only take it for one day. It won't work if you don't continue to take it. But you could sell single packs, right? Ah come on, leave me alone... Don't buy it then! Don't you sell single packs? Don't you sell single packs? Unfortunately... We're terribly sorry. Shut up, moron. Get lost! Stop that! But it's dirty. Who cares? Stop it. That's enough now.
