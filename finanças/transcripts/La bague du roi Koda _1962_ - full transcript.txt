King Koda's ring In a small village named Benga, reigned a very mean King named Koda Pinepi, Koda "black heart". He was named so because of his meanness, well-known in his kingdom. Near the house of the king, was placed the hut of a poor fisherman. He was named "Law of God". Law of God has three children, because he married Mina. She was selling his catches at the market to provide for her family. The family of the fisherman was happy despite its poverty. The household was filled with joy of life thanks to the three children. One day, as he was going home after fishing, Law of God was selling his fish, Here and there, as he was used to do. That day, misfortune had him meet the mean King, going home after a walk. He decided to buy one fish. - How much for you fish? - 300 Fr. It's too expensive! After a long talk, the King accepted to pay. Ad the fisherman went home. After Law of God left, the King asked the notables... "Who is this fisherman selling expensive fish?" One notable answered... "He's Law of God, he lives near your house." "Well, I will get revenge of this crook of a fisherman." "Law of God? Here, in my house? Law of God?" The king was vociferating. "Law of God?" "You, look at this ring." "I will entrust him with it. Wait, Pierre!" "Call Law of God." "Stand up, the Kings needs to see you. Stand up." "What did I do again?" "Walk! Come with me. You will know when we get there." "Ah, Law of God! You're here!" "Do me a favour." "This time," "it's not about the fish." "I really care for this ring!" "Keep it. In three years, I will ask for it." "If you loose it, I will kill you." "On a public place, I will make a show out of your death." "King, I will follow your orders." "Mina, the King gave me this ring. I shall keep it for him." "In three years, he will ask for it." "If I loose it, he will kill me." "But if I bring it back, he will give me wealth." "Let's hide it in a place I know. A very secured place." Thus, Law of God and his wife hid the ring and went back to work. Today is Friday. Law of God is doing his ablutions. He is going to the mosque for the prayer. "Ayo! It's good you are here. I need to talk to you." "Go to Law of God's place." "Tell his wife Mina to come and see me." "But be very careful." "Her husband must not see you." Ayo greets Mina. He whispers in her ear, so that Law of God's children cannot hear him. "Here you are, sweet Mina!" "I called you to ask you to do me a favour." "But you look skinny." "You must not be happy with your fisherman." "I will give you the opportunity to live the life you dream of." "Here is the condition." "All you have to do" "is to bring me the ring I gave to your husband a few days ago." "I will give you big treasure..." "but only in three years." "The secret must be known by nobody but the two of us." "The wife of the fisherman thinks for a while." "In the meanwhile, Ayo says..." "Listen, think about your kids." "How long will you be in this world?" Hearing this advice, Mina decided to betray her husband. The King was very proud of his scheme. "Ayo, nice move!" This is how the wife of the fisherman betrayed her husband and brought the ring to Koda. The king is very happy. He shows the ring to the griots. After Mina is gone, the King calls two strong rowers. He seats in a pirogue. His plan is to throw the ring in the middle of the river. 3 years have passed now. "Go find this crook of a fisherman!" "I will show him my law today. Go!" "Where is your husband?" "Today is the last day. Bring me my ring." "Right away!" "Mina, where is the ring we hid together?" "Leave me alone. I don't know." "Maybe someone spied on us the day we hid it." "I have no idea. Leave me alone." That day, the fisherman had a really hard time. "- Great, King... - You lost my ring?" "What?" "You lost my ring?" "Here is my sentence. Hear it." "You will see!" "Right now," "I will inform all the villages nearby" "that I will kill you here, this evening." "Great King, if I shall die tonight," "I will accept my fate." "Just let me feed my family one last time." "Go! Go! Go feed the whole village and your family!" Arrived home, Law of God decided to go to the river. He went to remove his fish trap. He found three fish inside it. He immediately went back to the village. On his way back home, the fisherman found buyers. He sold two fish. He kept the last one to feed his family. On his way, customers who were used to buy his fish wanted to buy to third one. But the fisherman refused. He came home with his only fish. Once at home, Law of Gad started to prepare his only fish. He was already thinking of his death. But then, thanks to the mercy of God, he found in great stupefaction the King's ring. He smiled because he was very happy. God was definitely great. After the preparation, the fisherman had a very good meal, before the dumbstruck eyes of his wife. In King Koda's courtyard, All the inhabitants were ready to attend the execution of the poor fisherman Law of God. The griots are praising King Koda Pinepi because he is enforcing his own law today. "Go forward!" "Crook!" "I entrusted you with a ring!" "I promised to reward you if you brought it back after three years." "The day to bring the ring back has come." He smiles and put the ring in the hand of the king, astonished and surprised by the move. God of Law had tricked him. Everybody was astonished: Ayo, the rowers... In the end, the whole village started dancing. As he had promised, he took a canary full of gold, and gave it to Law of God. "Take it", the king said. "That's not all. All the village belongs to you." "From now on, you and your family will live with me." "And I will give you half of my kingdom." "Take it." Back home, the fisherman was very surprised to find his wife taking car of herself while he was supposed to be executed. The fisherman was very surprised. The children understood immediately why Ayo the notable had come. And the fisherman was disappointed. He thought of his children and the life they used to live. He forgave his wife. Because it is what a believer should do. The end Subtitles: tadanobu@KG
