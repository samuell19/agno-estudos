Sky over Europe November, 1944 CR031915, almost at home. CR040904. Come in, the tower. I have no problems. AT699543. Come in, no problems. ET, Echo, Tango. 0710992. Entering without problems. My gentlemen. We are under 3000 meters. - They helped us for a while, what major? - Absolutely, Eddie. - How many German missiles did you see? - One. It flew quickly. - Joe. - I'm here. How many German jets did you see there? Two, I think. They flew right fast. What the heck is that? - It looks like a rocket. - Air defense? I do not think so. - Such a jet? - It's too big. - I never saw the spouse. - We report it to Colonel Richards. KOHNSTEIN An abandoned plaster mine in the middle of Germany So how is it in Berlin? The atmosphere is tense, as you may understand. What is the Führer's choice current my jets? The resources are at V2. The Führer fears that retaliation the program is the future of the Third Reich. Don't we have them in the air, does not matter. The problem is personnel, Colonel. Rockets do not require pilots. And the path to London has been very exact. Your program requires a comprehensive one education of available pilots -and their number decreases. So when got Jews their own office here? He develops the drive system for Von Braun. - And he studied under Einstein. - You don't pay him well? Of course not. He just cares about his family's security. - They are criminal workers here. - Difficult work I can imagine. Extremely. Sir. Excuse me, General. I have a nation to defend. Good morning, gentlemen. Do you represent the fighter pilots? - In principle everyone in our squadron, sir. - What is the problem? We do not understand how radio silence during the flights will help, sir. - That's what keeps us alive, sir. - We are not like 17. - They have their formations and rules. - That is right. And it's total radio silence until they return home. - But they've got orders for it. - Exactly. When the leader plane has released the cargo knows everyone else where they should. - That's not for us, sir. - When the bandits come in ... - ... it's total chaos. - Exactly. - Have you been up in the air, sir? - Sometimes last year. But that was before you came. Do not believe that we do not appreciate their help. Let me make it clear. It's not for to prevent you from notifying the others - if they are in danger or if there is any danger. The reason is not to disclose our position for the Germans - about what we do or where we are going and what we have in the cargo and so on. - OK I understand. - So cooperation with me. Speak as much as you want, but only when needed. We must not help their e-service. When all bombs are released, is it no longer a problem, okay? - Okay, sir. We inform the others. - I appreciate that. If you excuse me, I will smash the bombers in half an hour. My biggest concern is security. My previous drive was in one very safe piles that were bombed in rags. We are impenetrable. The rockets are the main target of the British -so they continue to bomb. It just gobbles down here. This is Isaac, our rocket scientist. He sits in the office next door. - So he's one of the protected Jews? - He is very important to our cause. - Quiet, Siegfried. Nice to meet you. - Miss Falenburg. - From Falenburg. - Excuse me, Miss Von Falenburg. - So when do you want to start sending? - Tonight after dinner. And ask the chef to cook some fish to Siegfried. - Don't you want fish, treasure? - Cursed cats. Cole, we need to talk about your brother. - What has he done now, sir? - I'm not talking about his jokes. - We must separate you. - Why, sir? Because he's your only brother, Cole. It's just the two of you, right? - That is right. - It began with the brothers in the Pacific. I have nothing to do with it. It is direct orders from headquarters. I have no choice. - I understand. Can I say it myself? - Yes, do it ... after the brifing. Yes, sir. Thanks. We have received the weather forecast. It doesn't look good. It becomes a clear sky with a lot limited cloud cover in the morning early. Remember how lucky you are compared with last year's crews. They didn't have the P51s who followed them completely there and back. - An applause for our little friends. - It's enough. - Sir, how many planes is that total? - 7-800, Cole. With such a great strength will Any plane guaranteed to be hit. The big ones will see the factories destroyed and they have decided. Besides, you shouldn't fly so close. Does anyone get hit you, You don't want them on you. More flights, fewer missions. It's logical. - More flights, more missions. That's how it is. - We have a mission ... ... and it's winning the war. Required a thousand planes a day, so it gets that way. And the rocket planes? They are rumored to be is twice as fast as our new 51. Colonel Thompson tells more about it.-Rob. Thanks, Colonel. There are aircraft with two jet engines. They are not as fast as everyone says. But definitely faster than anything we have right now. - Why don't we have something like that, sir? - We'll have that. How do the Germans build them? We bomb the shit out of them every day. - And the British strike every night. - Therefore, we must continue with it. Recently I saw something during a mission. It was not a jet, but a rocket. Big. As taken out of a sci-fi movie. And it moved quickly. Has anyone else seen something similar? Okay, gentlemen. I know you guys always hear about confidentiality- - But it's very critical in this case. What they have seen is no longer sci-fi. The Nazis have had sour bombs which we can shoot down with fighter jets - But now they have something new as they call "revenge weapon". There is a large rocket moving extremely fast and has terrorized - London and nearby areas almost daily. But all I can share with you. I'll inform you eventually. - You can continue, Colonel. - Thanks, Rob. - Joe. - So ... what do you think? - Everyone is afraid of the missiles. - They burn up like everything else. Listen. Colonel Richards came by and he says ... ... you have to get away from my plane and take another one. - Why? - Family members cannot fly together. - It has never bothered them before. - I know. It's not my decision. - Are you sure about that? - Yes of course. You are my brother and the best carpenter in Europe. - I'm not happy about that, Joe. - I say the number, then you get me. That would have been something. There will be many airplanes in the air tomorrow. Colonel Raiden. I'm not Ready to take Me262 into battle. I agree, Lieutenant. But you have to Understand that I need them in the air. It is our last hope to win the war. I'm worried that they are difficult to maneuver. Remember, I'm more used to it to these more moving 190's. I've seen you in the 262, Lieutenant. And you've done well. Remember that the key is gradual acceleration and deceleration. It is difficult in air combat. I will do my best To remember, sir. Good boy. - What is it, Benny? - It's the doll from Dresden, Major. God bless us. Not the bitch again. Good evening. This is the doll from Dresden here in beautiful Germany. And there you are, my young heroes. High up in the air on their mission. You think you're fighting honorably as knights, but think. What are you doing? You get away their bombs on women and children. They are innocent civilians who cannot defend themselves. This is how a butcher works, not a soldier. You destroy homes and families, just like their own in America. And I know you miss their homes and families. And especially your girlfriend. She must be so lonely. She misses you like that. But how long will she be able to to wait for you? - And will she still have you? - I don't want to hear it in my plane. The one whose voice must have a body. I want to see her. I can imagine. - Captain, I think we have something. - What is it, Joe? Not quite sure, sir. He is alone behind us. - Willis, do you see anything? - Only ours, Captain. Okay, everyone is on duty. Check the sun. - What about it? - There is something right under it. - You certainly see calls again. - I do not think so. Just the sun. I don't see anything. There is too much sun here. I want more cloud cover. - Confirmed. - How far is the goal? - Stop talking about the goal. - Perceived. skipper, I have bandits under me. Bandits? Where, Lucas? Below right. 4-5 o'clock. Joe, what have you got? Excuse me, carpenter, what do you see? - What is it, at two o'clock? - Looks like a bird flock. - There are big birds. - Now there are problems, boys. What the hell...? - Hell! Bandits! - OMG. - Take it easy. - Do they know we're here? - What are they doing? - Of course they know it. Should we fight the whole group? What the hell is this for Napoleonic tactics? - They're on second route, Captain. - Get me closer, Joe. I see something. - We're too close. - Here they come! - This is madness. - Just flat! - I can't separate them. - Fan formation! I see jets. 9 O 'clock. - It's just a diversion. - Protect the 17's! Remember the mission. Bombing down! Bombing down! - One more! - Do their job, guys. Yes! - What happened? - I can't control. - Captain! - We crash! Jump out! - Willis, take the parachute! - I can not! - For a nice performance. - Thank you, Captain. I'll ask you for a favor. It's a matter of PR. Yes? There is a girl working for us here. One of the prisoners. She's been thrilled by yours Performances and would like to meet you. - If you can have time. - Of course. - Madam. Are you the doll from Dresden? - Yes, it's my radio persona. It's an honor to meet you. I listen to you every single night. - Yeah? And what's your name? - Anna. - Oh well, Anna. What are you doing here? - I work in the factory ... ... but when I get older, I want to be just like you. So flattering. - Where does she come from? - Poland, originally. You can go now, Anna. - I want her to be eliminated. - Pardon? - Done as soon as possible. - And how do you want it to happen? May I tell an SS officer how does he do his job? Make sure the last thing she hears is my voice on the radio. Okay. Colonel Raiden's dog does not have got to work for the food for a while. Hope he likes Polish food. Has anyone seen Bender? He anybody seen Captain Bender? Captain Benders flight, Fire Down Below. Has anyone seen him? I haven't seen anyone from Benders flight. - Has anyone seen Joe Philips? - Wasn't he your skier, sir? - Sergeant Philips! Has anyone seen Joe? - Was he moved to Benders flight? Major? - Yeah? - I saw Benders fly. - Where? - In battle. - Didn't they turn back? - Bender's plane was shot down, Major. - How? - It looked like ... a collision. - A collision? Did you see that? - Yes, a jet, it looked like. Are you sure it was Bender's flight? It went very fast, sir. But that was what I saw. - Did you see parachutes? - It burned up fast. I didn't see anyone get out. Thank you, Sergeant. Warrenton, Georgia Two years earlier It's just us, tax. Excuse us for coming so late. - What is it, Mom? - Nothing. - We just have to talk to you. - Will you go to Grandma tomorrow? - Can we make homemade ice cream? - I hope so. - I'd like to taste a little. - Is there something about Grandma? No, we just wanted to gather everyone to talk about your dad. And your uncle. - Are you going to be a soldier, Dad? - Yes I will. - I knew it. - How it, Emily? Many other children's fathers have all gone. What do you think Grandma says? We have always been patriotic, so it probably goes well. It is not true! Am I the last to know? You should be ashamed! Did he get you to this? - No, Mom. We discussed it. - But not with me. May I talk to you alone. Yes, Mom. - Why is she so angry? - She's just uneasy, Emily. - What did you think, Cole? - It was not me. Many are referrals. You didn't hear President? Everyone must take their responsibility. - I guess it was right. - Thanks. For you! You've been away for ten years and I do not accuse you. This is a hole in the middle of nowhere And you've always had big dreams. And I'm proud of you, But Joe is different. He stayed here. He has a family now. A wife and a small daughter. Don't get me wrong. I will not see you hurt either, but Joe is ... He doesn't have the same reason as you And he has never had that. He is an adult man who can take care of themselves. You know what I mean. You took care of him as a child. You kept him out of trouble. I dont know why- - But I always have Be grateful for that. I took my choice and his, Mom. And we'll do it. It is our duty. Promise me that you do everything in your power to protect him. Do you promise? I must, Mom. I'll take care of him. One more. - Hey, Eddie. What's up? - I just wanted to say... - ... that I'm not a silent man. - Okay. - I just wanted to say it. - Come on, sit down. What are you telling me Eddie? It's Cole, sir. - Major Philips. I think he deserted. - Deserted? Philips? - It's unlikely. - I know, sir. But the incident with his brother ... I mean... They were close together. - When did you last see him? - Just when we returned. - He just disappeared. - So it was for about ... - ... 14 hours ago. - Yes, sir. You know what, Eddie? Get a jeep for us. Colonel, with all due respect. I'd rather not be with you. I don't want the major to believe that I'm involved, sir. Oh well. Stay here then. Hair you any idea where he can be? - Yes, sir. Probably at King's Pub. - Do you know where it is? - Yes, sir. - Tell it to the driver. - Sergeant, do you know where King's Pub is? - No. It's about eight miles along the main road from the base. - The place with thatched roof? - Yeah, Sergeant. Clear? Cole? - Cole? - Yes, sir? Look at me. - What are you doing here? - What does it look like? Drink me full. Come back with us. I fix some hot food and coffee. - Then you will feel much better. - I'm sorry about this, Colonel. - I sure woke you up. - Relax. But I have to get you out of service. A couple of weeks of perm had been good. - I understand, sir. - And nobody gets to know ... ... something about your little outing, provided that it doesn't happen again. Understood? Yes, sir. What do you think my brother Joe is have too chances, sir? Well, Cole. Some have returned. Resistance movement has been helpful - - But I'm not going to lie to you. Chances are not great. Oh well ... Joe can survive, sir. If he came down to the ground ... alive. - He survives in the woods. - You are close to each other. We did everything when we grew up. Our dad died The Great War When We Were Small. Was he a soldier? Listen, you don't need to Talk about it if you don't want to. - No, there's no danger. He was a pilot. - Is it true? Yes, sir. One of 20 who was shot down of a young German flygeress. The German planes maneuver much better than ours. - Was that the Red Baron? - No. It wasn't Baron von Richthofen. But I got to know who it was. You know how the army is. They don't tell if they don't have to. - You are right about that. - No, he called Raiden. R-A-D-E-N. I don't know much more than ... ... that he continued to fly after the war. I'm surprised you didn't leave off on a ship to find him. - The thought has struck me, sir. - Regardless. When on the ground, I appreciate You can hang out with the new pilots. - You know, maybe give them some advice. - Absolutely, sir. - What are you doing about my device? - I saw it ... ... and the memory of a device I had during the previous war. - I was a liaison officer. - You know it's a forbidden area. - Are there problems? - The Jew tampered with my equipment. Isaac, go back to your work. I apologize. Isaac hasn't been himself today. - He must be reprimanded. - It's not that simple. His son and wife works at this facility. Commanders have decided that they are too weak to continue - so they will be sent back to the camp in Mittelbau-Dora. And why is that a problem? These Jews are not even humans. It's a concern for me. Isaac must be productive. It should not repeat itself again. You make sure it doesn't. So, Captain. May I meet my wife and the sons before they are sent off? Unfortunately, I can Don't help it. - Miriam. - Isaac, get yourself together. You have to focus on what I say. - Radio equipment in the room next door. - Yeah? - Do you think you can use it? - I'm sure. Abrupt. I have to leave you now. I will disturb Colonel Raiden in his dinner. - Do I know him? - I do not think so. He is one of the commanders in the Me262 program. Yes ... the jets. I've heard about them. Fascinating machines. Yes, but the program lack of staff. But what you work with, is the future. Remember that. Come in. - Captain Messner. - Colonel. Excuse me for disturbing. I was all done. So, why this visit by SS? No problems, I hope. Not at all. I wanted to hit the war hero that everyone is talking about. - I'm just following orders. - Nonsense. 27 flights in two months. And with the new jet hunter. It's a fantastic plane. You should see her in the air. I would love to. - Same as last time, Rob? Brandy? - You have good memory, Malcolm. Within the e-service you giggle Of the forgetful types, you know. - Do you miss the officers in the RAF? - I guess so. But the man on the top comes not to leave the post for a while. So it felt best to touch me. Toast. Rob, I know you're busy. I appreciate you taking the time - But what brings you here really? Malcolm, my boys are afraid of German technology. - You're thinking of Me262. - And the rockets. The big ones. Terrorist weapons if only purpose is to spread fear - Among a war-torn population as everything has suffered enough. You're right, Malcolm, But we are here now. And we have better bombers, ammunition and tactics than we have ever had. - But we need goals. - Exact targets are a problem with Me262. They are built in abandoned tunnels and bombed cathedrals. - Even in the woods under the trees. - And the rockets? Slightly harder to hide. They require skilled fitters and the fuel system is sensitive. Ethyl alcohol and liquid oxygen. But there is a large factory where you build both Me262- -and the V2 rockets. The Germans call it Kohnstein. So Colonel, tell about the wonderful the plane I've heard so much about. You know you're doing to become the next red baron. propaganda Ministry does a good job, right? I first joined the squadron as a night fighter pilot against the British. That is why the foremost are painted black and scare the Americans. But how did you manage so many shootings? 25 of 27 were Mosquitos, RAF's two-engine work horses. My jets have a top speed which is 200 km faster than the Mosquito. They never understand what hits them. - You've probably thought of Kohnstein. - Of course. We bombed the shit out of it. The problem is that it is in an old plaster pit. Well protected by mother earth. - So what can you give me for goals? - Mobile airports. They have adapted and can move large operations in less than a day. Right now I can reveal two or three places where there may be Me262. How can you if they move so fast? Our e-service is first-rate, Dear Colonel. First class. So from one admirer to another. Tell me about the rocket I've heard of. - What have you heard? - That it has the capacity to reach ... - ... the east coast of the United States. - Pure speculation of course. But I've seen the plans. Such a weapon can secure The future of the third kingdom. Such a weapon, the colonel can be the beginning of the Fourth Empire. Malcolm, I take whatever you give me, but Kohnstein fascinates me. Be patient with that, Colonel. Sometimes cruel empires fall together from within. - Malcolm, do you have any inside? - At this time... ... I have no chance to discuss it. Colonel Raiden, I appreciate yours enthusiasm for the Me262 program- - But your squadron is down in two now. Good pilots are hard to find. And I have to change the airstrip daily. - Still, you have time to visit us here. - Parts. I have a lack of parts, Captain. The fact is, I have to gather two trucks and take the parts to Frankfurt. Frankfurt? Unusual they want move to such a big city. They don't need that. The strip is located one hour south and more inland. - Reports according to orders, sir. - Good evening, Major. - Finished with the torture of newcomers? - I'm just saying it, sir. - Well, they fear God and that's good. - Yes, sir. - Sit down. - Yes, sir. Cole, we got information who may interest you. - I see you have a new map, sir. - We've found some of the rocket planes. Yes, we located a mobile aircraft station one hour southwest of Frankfurt. And our men on the ground say There are two or three jets there. They are produced by Messerschmitt and the model is 262. - They have worried our boys. - Are you submitting 17, sir? It is a wasp nest and it can emerge fighters at any time. 109's and 190's. They will let us go. And the 262s can be found in bunkers. - What do you want me to do, sir? - You haven't flown in a month ... - ... and I know you're craving. - Yes, sir, I am. Tell me, Cole. When did you fly a Mustang last? About a year ago, sir. But it was not a new model. The new models are faster, take more cargo, but has the same characteristics. I still like my old plane, sir. Gunfighteren. Gunfighteren? It still stands on the runway. Take it if you want. It is completely voluntary so clear. If you don't want to, you can still fly. But it will be in a new B17. The hole in the side of your old plane ... - ... has put her out of the game for a while. - Yes, sir. I saw her down on the runway. She looked lonely out there. The other reason is that I'm sitting in a pinch. The goal is a mobile airstrip -and they can change places in six hours. All my P-51 pilots escort. I do not send out unutilized pilot. - I understand, sir. What is the mission? - It's going to be a daymare. Two hunters are with. You come under the radar, very low. - Very low over rough terrain. - Looks fun, sir. We need someone to fly it second plane, a P-38. Any suggestions? What is being said about Eddie, the second pilot my? He's ready for the 38. - A two-man man. - Yes, sir. Okay, come with Eddie after breakfast tomorrow, we go through the plans. - Something else, sir? - What do you mean? You said there were two reasons that you would have with me. Oh yes. Well, I don't want you reads in too much in what I should say. - Is it about my brother, sir? - No, I wanted that. I did some research on the German Ace, Colonel Raiden. - Colonel Raiden, sir? - You were right. He's serving. He's been in the Luftwaffe from creation. When it comes to the airstrip, Raiden is involved, but we do not know how. Yes, the ace from the previous war, Colonel Raiden became the leader - for the 262 program in 1942 and he convinced the management of Luftwaffe -to use the plane as a fighter plane. - Hitler wanted it as a bomber. - Yes, think so. Don't be too optimistic, but yours German aces can be on the airstrip. - Colonel? - Yeah, Cole? I do it on two terms. Firstly I want a rescue bag behind the seat. It is possible, but I have to check with the mechanics. - What do you think? - Eddie doesn't come back in the 38th ... - ... we can still get back. - You're at the limit of the range. Uses some rescue bag, so there is no oxygen mask. - So the height becomes very limited. - I understand, but we still fly low. - And I want to fire the plane, sir. - I assumed it. - How did my name appear? - I volunteered. - So why did you do that? - Because you like to fly the P38s. Yes, I like to fly them, but will not necessarily die in one. - You're fine. - I've never been in battle with one. - What if there is air combat? - We don't fly so loud, so relax. - Can you get the weapons in the 38's now? - Machine gun in the nose. Easy to aim. 51 is different. Six machine guns. Three on each wing. - What happened to the cannon? - The ammunition is too heavy. I like the cannon. "Journey's End"? - I like it. It's poetic. - Yes, if I come back. Otherwise it is tragic. Eddie. No matter what happens, so I won't leave you, okay? Likewise. My gentlemen. The German planes are ahead all 190's and are here - scattered around the control station. There may also be air defense batteries. We do not know how many or where. That's all we know now. Our main goal, the Me262s, should be here. They can be protected or so you have luck and then they are outdoors. Either they are thought of or ready to take off. - The key is to knock out the air defense first. - Yes, but you have to fly low ... ... and slowly, otherwise they know you are coming. Is that the case, It should be quick to you. Eddie, we separate teams and strike against both sides of the strip at the same time. Once you have taken the guns you have to Drop the bombs and destroy the path. Otherwise, you get a swarm of 190's after you within five minutes. - I'm skeptical, sir. - Why not? The 190's are agile. They can avoid the holes and lift. They come after us like a meat after a pork chop. Okay, so what do you suggest? I think we forget the bombs. We separate teams. Eddie takes the air defense - And I'm taking the tankers for then they can never take off. The bombs make a difference to fuel, sir. Otherwise we might end up in the canal. - Okay, Eddie. Is it okay for you? - I want to release the 190's. If Cole's plan prevents it from happening, I'm happy. Sir, we're getting some ammunition on back road. Do you know anything about the jetplanes- - If they were to get one up in the air? We hope this doesn't happen, but if they do you should remember- - that they are faster, but cannot fly as far as or maneuver as you. - So why do we do it during the day? - Most planes on the airstrip ... ... including the 262s Don't stand there at night. Why not? They are up in the air and hurt our British friends. I hear the noise from the engines now, sir. I don't like precision bombing with these planes. That's why I'm a pilot, not a bomb slayer. What is it? Butterflies in stomach? Butterflies, field and stuff. Everything thanks to you. - I'm with you all the time, okay? - Let's get it over, Major. Come on, we go. - Hi, Isaac. - Mr. Von Braun? So good to see you. I didn't know you were coming. Fast communication is not always best at this time, Isaac. I understand. So what's the latest news? First, I have noticed that they have expanded the trophy room. - Some have hunted a lot. - Yes, it's General Stahkman ... ... and his officers from the camp in Mittelbau-Dora. I understand. Was that where you sat, Isaac? For them I am an important part of the V2 program thanks to you. But my family has been sent back there ... - ... and I fear for their lives. - I don't know much about the plant. It is notorious for diseases, abuse and cruel working conditions. Unfortunately, it applies to all camps. Isaac, the V2 program is a success thank you my work ... - ... and you obviously. - How do you define success? - Do you remember our time in Berlin at Technicia? - Yes, I think we met ... - ... in 1931. - Something like that. - I was so young. - And my hair was much darker. We talked about the voyages we did would do with our rockets. - We had such big dreams. - Yeah. So many dreams. The rockets that hit London seemed perfect ... ...except that they landed on the wrong planet. I heard someone talk about you as Professor Von Braun. Is that right? - Yes, but it's old news. - Tell what happened. Then V2 is still the A4 program when the Führer was overstated as he - a movie we recorded of a successful launch. So happy that he personally insisted that I should get a professor title. Congratulations, Werner. I'm happy They have a good eye for you. Well ... I don't know. Sometimes I am Not so afraid to say what I mean. I remember you then got problems at school. The professors discussed your arrogance in the faculty room. In February I was called to Himmlers headquarters in Prøysen. He's trying to take control all weapons programs, including V2. Himmler and I didn't get along. Above all, because I didn't want to work - with those he wanted that I should work with. - Were they not competent? - They weren't as brilliant as you. So last year I visited and an engineer a dentist. It was a female dentist I later learned was the SS spy. She heard us talk about the rocket program and that space travel is at the core of our work. Not war. We may also have mentioned something about that the war does not go so well for Germany. This was obviously reported and I was arrested in March by the Gestapo. I was their "guest" for two weeks in one of their cells in western Poland. I guess it doesn't was a charming hotel. There was isolation in a dungeon. I didn't think I should survive - - But I was released and got to know that they could not continue without me. So now you have to Look over your shoulder. Isaac, believe me. Nobody is safe. I don't let one night pass with the jets on the ground. We have thought of all 262's except yours. And why isn't my plane being fueled? - It's the link, Colonel. - What link? The broken connector was replaced, but we got into trouble. How should I fly? without fuel and spare parts? The guns first ... The guns first ... Come on, Eddie. Where are the guns? There are no guns. Eddie, take them out if you dare. On the horizon! On the horizon! Alarm! Shoot against the tomotors! How to do it! I'll take the lead from here. A guess, but I think they were just thinking. We get shot, Major. All right. Let's see how slow you are. The ammunition ends quickly if we continue like this. Major? Major, I have a problem. I see that. Come with me. Go back the same way we came. Take her out a few miles out and land in a field. Hold hard in the muzzle. They won't wait. I'll pick you up in a few minutes. - Where are you going? - I'm driving a round. They still have fly-flying aircraft. We cannot allow that. Okay, Major. I'm counting on you. - How bad are you? - It hurts, Major. I want to know who they are. They are incredibly brave. - They're enemies, sir. - They are pilots. With a squadron like them I could have won the war. It should not be good. It certainly went straight through. Okay, listen. Hold out. I'll take you to the plane. - Come on, Eddie. It won't be easy. - Only we come home. What is this? Loaf. Now you have me in a wooden box. Colonel Raiden? - Do you know him, sir? - No. - It's certainly personal. - My dad's greeting. I don't think anything will fly here. - Yes, sir. - I want you to do the following. Prepare my jet plane and make sure it is fully stocked. Sir, I repeat it again, but the plane your was not refueled before the attack. I know. Are you out there, Joe? Are you anywhere? Yankee Doodle rode on a pony ... - Yankee Doodle rode on a pony ... - Are you behind, Eddie? I think I faint, skipper. Hold out. Loaf. What the hell is going on, major?! - I think I'm sick. - Fuck too! Say something, Eddie. Stay with me, boy. Stay with me. Are we coming soon, skipper? Almost. I heard you Don't sing over the channel. The acrobatics ... almost killed me. What happened to the jet? It must have run out of fuel. He's still out there. I appreciate the ride home, Major. Cursed good job, Eddie. Really good. Major Philips. Colonel Richards want a complete report. - And by the way your brother is back. - Excuse me, what did you say? Your brother, Joe. Joe Philips, right? - Sniper Joe, sir? - He took over the border. - Where is he, sir? - I saw him over there with the others. Okay. Don't forget Colonel Richards. He wants a complete ... report. Soldier! Soldier! - Have you seen Joe Philips? - Who? - Joe Philips. - Is he a pilot? Shooter? Sniper Joe. Not? Thanks. Who are you joking at now, jerk? Mom gets really happy that you managed. - Look at you! - Still a jerk. - Tell me what happened. - I will. How's Eddie doing it? Not good. I'll look to him immediately. Wish I could... - ... tell your wife and your kids. - They'll know it soon. He managed, Lilian. Joe managed. - He did. Dad comes home. - Yes, he does, tax. Yes he does... - I gave you a brandy. - Thank you, Malcolm. They said it hurried, So I hurried here. I heard about it hurting your boys did the airstrip we talked about. Yes, it was a bit of a raid and we had never managed it without your help. I hope both pilots managed safely home. One of them was seriously injured, But he does. Good for him. The boy has got a ticket home. I'm not sure. He can have much left to give ... - ... but tell about Kohnstein. - The Germans have some surprises. - What do you mean? Beyond the V2 Rocket? - In Adolf Hitler's distorted brain ... ... the V2 rocket is considered as a retaliatory or revenge weapon. He sees it as a revenge on us Brits for all our bombings. The pig doesn't care that they started bombing us first. - You know what they say. Everything is allowed ... - In war and love. Kohnstein is still the main factory for Me262. It is also the premier factory for the V2 rocket. And that is also the place of research and development of new projects. - With the same V2 technology? - About, but much bigger. The goal is to hit targets on the US east coast. - Do you think they can handle it? - Otherwise I wouldn't have called you. They are building a prototype now. This war must end. We must do everything in our power to stop them. The war must end. Miss von Falenburg. Pardon that I can only now dinner. I hope your visit not been too bad so far. You don't have to excuse yourself. Thank you for taking the time. Hopefully the situation will improve in Berlin so you can return home. The most important thing is that I can continue my work for the war effort. Germany must win. I completely agree. I've heard many of their broadcasts, so I'm acquainted with your persona. But I know very little about you. Tell, miss. What are you going to do after the war? You mean after The Triumph of the Third Reich, General? Of course, Miss. That's exactly what I mean. I'll do everything in my power for that Germany remains the foremost empire -In world history. Many people forget to conquer easily can be very difficult. General, when I see what we are has accomplished the last five years - - I can only imagine what we can accomplish the next 20, 50 ... - ... or 500 years. - So thought-provoking, Miss. - We do this again sometime. - It will be an honor, General. - Is this all about V3? - Yes, all I'm responsible for. Do you really think the drive system can operate a rocket larger than V2 ... - ... all the way to America's east coast? - I'm convinced. All right, Isaac. I want you to do the following. Go through all your plans and equations and make sure they do not work. - What? - But don't make it obvious. Captain? Are you... Mr. Abramovic. I think you are a smart man. - What is the mission, Captain? - Destroying this plant. Can you confirm my family is safe and has moved from here? They have been relocated. I put them on the train myself. Oh well. Then I agree. I want you to use the radio in the room next door and sends a short message - at a specific time. Can you make it? Yes, if her majesty Mrs Falenburg is not there. I make sure she's busy. Isaac, it must be done when the Me262 - and the rockets are moved from this facility in two days. - What is modest? - It is... Now is the time for all good men to help their country. - Repeat it twice. - Captain. - You would be convinced as an American. - Or as a German. Dedicated to all men and women as served during World War II.
