Mr. Niox, please. On behalf of Mr. Freeman. It is really whole? Complete, Mr. Freeman. Collated by Thomas from the National Library. And we can get it out of France? - Nothing against. - So nothing prevents your selling it to me. - Yes! Sorry? I do not want to anymore. Listen, I did a three week study, I came from Washington for it and now you don't want to sell. Come on! One million dollars for a manuscript is unprecedented! Mr. Freeman... It is not a manuscript. This is THE manuscript. Do you know a lot of 14th century manuscripts made for the King of France? How much do you think the GNP of the United States is? The GNP? Gross national product. 1268 billion 600 million dollars. So there's nothing unique about your million, Mr. Freeman. Now let's talk business. How many royal manuscripts from the fourteenth Century do you know of? I know one, you hold it in your hands. And it's mine. How much then? Where did I put it? You opened it this morning. But I opened it, moved it... Answer! There's one billion in it! Hello? Landeau? Yes. Pierre? All right! In a good mood, as usual. A little trip in Egypt made him relax. Ah, the Carpaccio painting? Yes... Landeau's on the phone The Carpaccio, still interested? Yes, he is. He would like to see it again. But anyway, it's too expensive. - Yes, I'll tell him... - I remember! I threw it under the bed. - Hi, did you sleep well? - All right. I'm happy to see you. Mr. Niox! I would like an answer. Come, my dear friend, I will explain. Come on, come on. Mr. Freeman, Kathia, Kathia, Mr. Freeman. Get dressed! Look and admire. In Liechtenstein, it takes thick armor-plating to house this treasure For me, a humble trader, a briefcase is enough. The minutes of Ravaillac's confession implicating the King of Spain... Gold cutlery which belonged to Fran?ois the first. Go ahead, take a look. - So what? - So, dear Freeman, to tear away the manuscript from my collection. in which it would leave a painful hole, you must do better and more. OK. I get it. You're leaving already? Here! Be nice. Mr. Freeman, you're not leaving until tomorrow? Yes? Well, you take Kathia with you. As a gift. No thanks. I already regret selling you the manuscript. You see? He doesn't want you, but that's o.k. he wouldn't have known what to do with you. No! You keep it, for the humiliation. - Well, I don't care. - I do. Yes? Who? Miss de Bois-Ros?, you know her? This is the name of the seller of the house. - His daughter? - What does she want from me? Say I'm not here. Hold the line! Enough? Enough. - Dear Freeman. - Dear old friend... Yes! Mr. Niox? Indeed. I got your address from the notary. Mr. Freeman, Placide Justin, Miss... Miss de Bois-Ros?. De Bois-Ros?! I bought this nice old house from her father. A lot of renovation work! - May I? - Yes. You will have to come and see the house when everything is repaired. - You're going to be late. - Late? You're having dinner with the curator of the Stockholm museum. I had forgotten! Miss, I was delighted to meet you. Leave your address, Placide will phone you. He will. Probably sooner than you imagine. The simplest thing is that I leave the name of my mother's lawyer, President Dalseul. He had advised me not to come. So, why did you come? To see the face of the man who was cynical enough to coerce a dying man into selling his house.. I thought people like you only existed in Balzac's novels. So you think I acquired this house unduly? Not unduly but unlawfully. My father was under a prohibition process. See the civil procedure code. Cancel the curator, I have to work with mademoiselle. Do you always eat so fast or do I make you nervous? Ah, frankly, I've never seen anyone eat so slowly. I'd like to have more champagne. - Wine waiter? - You need him to serve me? Slowly! Champagne is fragile. My father taught me that. Did he? You don't need the waiter to hold my hand? You don't want to have sex right now on the seat here? You only like whores, it's obvious. They offer themselves for an agreed price whereas you... - Whereas me? - You offer without offering and refuse to quote your price. You don't know what you want. I want Justice. - Let's be simple, Miss... - Edwige. I only call whores by their first name. Let's talk about the house. Let's talk about it. I paid for your house. To a man who could not sell his property. It's the notary's responsibility. He should have told. The card for mademoiselle. Would Madame want to taste the Norwegian green almond souffl?? - I've never had it. - It's delightful. We crush the fresh almonds... - Very well. Your thing takes a long time? You're in a hurry? If you are in a hurry, you will have to wait before entering your home. President Dalseul is a winner, he told me that anyway, if we plead, there will be at least 12 years. How old are you? I? 40. A bit tight if you have decided to plant olive trees there. You took the money! The amount of the cheque, yes. But the backhander... went to my father's mistress. You must give this house back to us. "To us". It's not just me, there's also my mother and my sister. - Send me the bill at the hotel. - Of course sir. - Is the castle on fire? - No, excuse me, staying in one place for hours makes me sick. - I blame you. - For the House? No, for the dessert. Where are we going? I dunno. We could have stayed at the restaurant. No. We must move! Life is movement! Where can I drop you off? Here! All right, we'll leave it at that. Yeah right! Farewell miss. Will you give us back our house? No, miss. When will you call me Edwige? When you tell me your price. Expensive. Very expensive. Here is the person in charge, Minister. Who discovered these priceless treasures in the heart of Africa. - Thank you. - And... You found these objects yourself? Yes. It was not easy. - Sorry. - After you. I had to convince the tribal chiefs. - May I? - After you. It is, so to speak, of the fundamental deities, of the fetishist religion. - Very pretty. - This is a necklace... Michel? Philippe! - Excuse me. - Please do. Mr. Niox? Beautiful! - Allow me to congratulate you. - Thank you, sir. I am the son of Prince Nyamb?, from the Hafi tribe, not far from the village where you found these objects. Unbelievable. Though my late father was a connoisseur, he was unaware of the existence of these treasures. Your father was a collector? He owned a lot of items? Good ones and bad ones. But there is this piece of a quality, allow me to tell you, infinitely more beautiful than those exhibited here. And... possibly it would be for sale? The English insist on getting it. My brothers agree. I'd rather keep it. But... reason wins out. I might be leaving for London tomorrow. Listen, dear friend, do nothing without consulting me Here! My card... Be kind enough to come and see me tomorrow morning, before 11 a.m., at the George-V hotel. And you think they are more beautiful than those in the exhibition? I have no opinion, I saw nothing, but... that's what he says. Why not? I have to see. Here he is! Ah, that's it? Have you thought about your price? I did a lot better. Coffee? No. Is under curatorship? What does that mean? President Dalseul will explain. We took it to court. I'm going to Mas Vieux tomorrow, do you want to come? I have an appointment with my lawyer. Again? You don't need a lawyer, you're much more efficient. Wait, you haven't seen anything yet. What do I do with this? Keep it... for the record. Edwige... If I was smart, I would move here. I would take some rest. I've been fooling around for 20 years. I am wealthy, very wealthy. - You have a crazy life. - With, at the end, a sarcophagus. Not even. Even worse, at the P?re-Lachaise cemetery. At my age, my father had four children. You see, this house is a sign. - I have to marry it. - The house or the girl? You called her lawyer? Yes, but it's useless, the procedure is instituted. You have to see the family. Mr. Niox! There is a problem where we want to put the water-cistern. A cut stone, a sort of cube... I tried to unearth it, but I can't! Let's go and see. It's Romanesque. Pure romanesque. Try to move this No, no, not with the pick. Mr. Niox, there's one more here. Slowly. No more pickax, no more pickax, no more shovel, nothing. For each column uncovered, I triple the hours. I am Capricorn, right at the entrance of Virgo. I'm getting into the most favorable triangle of my life. A few weeks ago, the golden mask. 8 days ago, the shack. And today... a true Romanesque cloister. You forget the negro, pal. He's just sent me the photographs. If it suits us, he is ready to talk to his brothers. But they want to be paid cash because of the political situation. As for him, he wants a 5% commission, to be paid in Paris. Without his brothers knowing. Four! Say, they're awesome. At first glance, they're better than mine. We have to see. Aren't you going to bed? No. I'm staying here. Antoine! Come give me a hand! All right! We'll leave when you tell us. It's the negro. Your thermos is there. Yes? There's a Paris-Nyamb? twice a week? It's perfect. OK. We'll wait till we hear from you. Thank you. Goodbye, prince. See ya! He calls me "pal". I say "goodbye " to him, he says "See ya" to me. I hate familiarity. - Hi, son - Hello, Mr. Mayor. Hi everyone! Hello, Mr. Mayor. - Hello, Mr. Niox! - Hello, Sir. You know me? Let me introduce myself: Mr. Servier, mayor of Saint-Agupine. - Hi, Gaston. - Hello, Mr. Mayor. Your mayor and general councilor. At your service. Hello Mr. mayor. Some coffee? No, thank you, I already had mine. Oh my... Oh, gosh... Oh! How beautiful it is! Incredible! Oh, poor Bois-Ros?! He didn't know there was a treasure hidden under his house. It's wonderful! Pure romanesque! As beautiful as in Fontfroide. Somewhat more beautiful, I'd say. Are you an archaeologist? Yes, a bit. In Provence, everyone is an archaeologist. And who told you, Mr. Mayor? Who told me? There are no secrets in Saint-Agupine! Well... Say, we'll have to classify it all. I have ideas. The land above, there... it belongs to my brother. He is a public works contractor. So we could perhaps make a large parking lot, and even a motel. You know, a motel? There is a shortage of rooms around here. - A motel? - Yes. Here? Don't you realize how lucky you are? They'll come from Cannes, Marseilles... New York to see this! No! What do you mean? No? Here it's my place. I don't want it to become a meeting point for Sunday walks. You want to keep it all for yourself? - Certainly. - Oh yes, but say... These excavations belong to the National Heritage. I don't give a shit about National Heritage, Mr. Mayor. But what about the visitors? The people who will come, you piss them off too? Not but I won't invite them to my wedding night. What does it have to do with it? Nothing but that's the way it is. Yes, but you haven't got any choice. The land above belongs to my brother. And the stream that feeds this property comes from there. Do you understand? Got it! He is crazy! - He will fill it all? - Looks like it, yes. - Where's the phone? - In the entrance hall. What are you doing? But do you realize what you are doing? Do you think this is your place? - You don't have the right! - Placide! Yes! We've got a plane ready to take off in an hour. To go where? Where does your mother live? What are you going to do? End it. We have to be firm, you will support me. There are 4 minutes left. He's behind the door. He gave me 10 minutes, he won't give me 11! What does he want? The house, me... everything. - Edwige... - The lawyer isn't that sure. He said to me: "Threaten without breaking the bridges." Oh dear! Calm down, mom, calm down! Hello. My respects, madam. - Charming house. - There is nothing here that could interest connoisseur like you. Yes, madam, one thing. Something without a price. The atmosphere. I bought Le Mas Vieux in good faith. I like it now. And I'd have a hard time parting with it. I'll buy it from you. Buy it from me? But you've already bought it. Yes, I bought it from Monsieur de Bois-Ros? but in order to put an end to a dispute which would poison our relationship, I brought 200,000 francs in cash as compensation. - 200,000 francs? - That's 20 million, mom. And you offer it like that? Yes, madam, like that. Say no, mom. I forgot to introduce Marie to you. My sister Marie. If I understood well, the sum does not seem enough. It's not about money. I don't want to lose this house. But in that case, what do we decide? These young ladies are resilient. I congratulate you, madam. Well, let me deposit the sum in question here. Think about it, see with your daughters and let me know your decision. What happened to you? I thought you never gave in. A strategic withdrawal, which will enable us to spend the weekend together in Venice. We leave tomorrow at 10. Why are you doing this? Because I want to have sex with you. - For 20 million? - For 20 million. The answer is no. Marry me. It's yes. One more word, madam. I have the honor, Madame de Bois-Ros?, to ask you for the hand of your daughter Edwige. The suite per il signore Niox! Thank you sir. Prego. You'll see, the living room is sublime! Non mi ricordo. Last time, the gentleman only stayed three hours You remember because I left hurriedly. It was because of the ladywho was with you. - How was she? - Very charming. More charming than I? Signore Niox, I hope you will like the room... - Who is it? - Luggage. Very good! Here! Thank you! Bravo! Here! Who is it? The chamber maids. The last time you came here, you only stayed three hours. Why? I don't really remember. I think it's because her French was bad. You don't like foreigners? She was French, but on arrival she said she had to go "to the W.C." It's an expression I can't stand. We have enough to withstand a siege. Seven days changing three times a day plus two ball gowns. How long shall we stay? It's up to you to decide. Are you sure you love me? Sure. Even after you've made love with me? It depends on you. All right! It's all right! I'll do it! - What is it? - Cable for Mr. Niox. - What's going on? - It's a telegram. - Shit, shit, shit and shit! - What? Is the 16th today? - Departure from Orly this afternoon. - What, you're leaving? The concierge, please. I thought you'd given no one your address. It's that wonderful story I told you about. You know, that black prince, the masks... A unique opportunity. Concierge? Yes, first plane to Paris, direct, please. 1 p.m.? Reserve two seats. Yes that's it. Send me the porter in five minutes and prepare my bill. Thank you. Mr. Niox. That's it. I think we broke your girlfriend's record: 2 minutes 45 seconds. An opportunity presents itself, an item, a painting, I can't resist. - I see. - You see nothing at all! Money, things, I don't care. It's the game which is fun. The moment when I buy. Because selling is not fun either. What fascinates me is buying. It is true. You bought me, from my mother, and at quite a high price, I must admit. I care about you like I never cared about anything. Make love to me. Quick, we're leaving in an hour. See you soon, prince. Sir! Sir! Departure for Nyamb?, Air France flight 755, immediate boarding gate 50. Sorry, my prince, I'm not leaving. But it's impossible, Mr. Niox. You will create a diplomatic incident! Pierre... I have something to ask you. I don't want to live in a hotel anymore. Well... buy an apartment. There, like that, right now? Like that, right away. Lets' go! No, Pierre... I buy the apartment. You are leaving. I want you to. Come on, go! Gentlemen, your boarding passes. This way. Departure to Nyamb?, Air France flight 755, immediate boarding gate number 50. Pierre! Do you have preferences for the apartment? Carte blanche! Gentlemen, step forward! Welcome to our young republic. Welcome, gentlemen. My brothers. - Nothing to declare? - Leave them. They are our guests Forward the luggage. Gentlemen... May I know where we're going? We're almost there. Sir... The gentlemen are here. My respects, sir. Which one is Pierre Niox? That would be me. You are charged with theft of national property and illegal export of works of art. According to article 447, the penalty is 3 to 5 years in jail You should know that no one in this country has the power to pardon. There is also a fine of 5 million French francs to which must be added, Sir, the return of the imported items. You are the accomplice of these gentlemen? I'm the instigator. I introduce myself. Andr? Dubois, inspector general of the fine arts administration. Take them to the central jail. I want my embassy to be informed. You are here in a democratic country. As soon as the charges have been brought, you can choose a lawyer. We have some excellent ones. - You're not eating? - Holy shit! Four more days here and I'll go nuts. You really don't want to contact the Foreign Affairs? To become the laughing stock of the whole world? I'd rather die! Africa! Hello? Paris? Ah, hello, Mr. Cultural Attach?. You got the masks back? They're at the embassy? Great! Oh, here, one or two formalities, and these gentlemen will be able to return to France by the end of the morning. That's right. The weather here? It is very mild. 38 degrees. That's it. Goodbye, Mr. Cultural Attach?. So? So, the amount of the fine is 2,652,700 francs. There is also 80.08 francs for living expenses. That's out of the question, these gentlemen are our guests. So it will only cost 2,652,700 francs. Mr. Niox, please. Great! Gentlemen, it's not over yet. Mr. Pierre Niox, allow me, at the end of this too short ceremony to present you with the insignia of Commander of our National Order for service rendered to our country. Without you, this wonderful exhibition could never have taken place. You managed to weave even tighter the links which unite our Republic and France. On behalf of our President, I name you commander of the national order. And you, Mr. Placide Justin, who have contributed so skillfully to this endeavor, the President names you Knight. And you, so smart, you didn't suspect anything. No. This Dubois, what an actor! And his commission which he demanded behind his brothers' backs. No thanks. You're not eating? I have a mask on my stomach. Some more champagne? Yes a lot. We've been deprived of it for four days. You were on a safari? ... yes. Photo or animal? Uh... animal. Buffalo or elephant? Idiots, miss. Idiots safari. We were even killed, both of us. You have in front of you two well stuffed idiots. Today he is mine. Here, you are at home. Say...come and see. This is an 18th century woodwork. They repainted it. We just have to sand it. I would like to know why you insisted on my leaving. The prince had slipped me an envelope. - Seriously? - You don't like when I speak seriously? Answer. One falls in love with a guy, and insist on changing him. When he has become another, one says: "I don't like him now" You want to change me a little, don't you? When I was little, we were often taken on picnics. We would sit in a field, unfold a large tablecloth pick flowers. And at the end of the field, there were fast trains. And from inside the trains, people were looking at us. I was very unhappy. Why? Because I wasn't on the train. And now? Now, I'm on the train, and I don't want to stop it. Mr. Placide makes told us to say that if Monsieur needs him, he will be at home. Thank you, Julien. What's that? "Miss de Bois-Ros?". "These masks are for you. with Placide's respects" Those masks are yours. Why would he offer them to me? You'll explain. Yes. When you brought back these masks from Africa, I was frightened. All these masks in a hotel room, in your mess, with all those people No! So I went to a founder's, to Dentu's He made casts. And when the masks had to be returned, I had the copies delivered. Tell me, you bastard, if there hadn't been this story, you would have told me of your little casting business? Wouldn't you have been tempted to keep the real ones and give me the fakes? You are suspicious. I save you $ 500,000 and that's the way you thank me? Placide, you're the greatest! I am your pupil. At times, you're a real pain in the arse but all that is counterbalanced by a some degree of... innocence. I don't know why, looking at them earlier, I started to like them less. And with good reason. Here! Look! Copies? These are the real ones. And those at the George-V? Copies. The Africans'ones? Copies. No, don't worry, I didn't have time to have a third cast made. Are you sure you didn't want to con me too? I thought about it. You knock down the partition for me. I want direct access on the kitchen and the breakfast area. These two windows, you make them bigger. I want to be able to dive into the Seine. The ceilings will fall! We need IPM's. Here too. Light! Enlarge! I'll give you a quote and prepare a great place to show your collections! My collections! I have no collections. Don't listen to him. He has a collection, a nice collection of shoes. - 55 pairs. - But in this case, the paintings? I buy, sell, search and find some, but I don't have any! In any case, I need the apartment finished in a month. A month! The 18th century woodwork. You don't touch it. You leave it as it is. If you want a stooge to call the suppliers and... watch your repair works, I'm not the man for you! Good day, sir! Come on, boys. He is the 5th decorator who jumps ship. - I'm not the one who'll tell Edwige. - Where is the phone? It's been six months since your express wedding six months of outbursts, of surprise travels She is tired, in my opinion. And she wants to stop, - stop in her house. You get it? - What the hell is she doing? I dropped her off at her mother's at 11am! Always her mother! She lives at her mother's, because the apartment is not finished. Hello Madam. Is Edwige... - Edwige is in bed. - She is sick? - No. She is resting. - I'm coming. But... Pierre! If you go to bed at 7pm, it means you're sick. - Not for us! - For me, yes. She looks terrible! You ask too much from her. Leave her with me tonight! Mom feels alone. Why do you mind for one night? Come! I want you! He wants me! I wonder what you would do if you had to wait 9 months for a child. I would do like everyone else, I would wait. I doubt it. You're right. I think I would try to push nature. I would do lots of plans for the kid, that way, I would try to... When is it due? I'm going to ask you the impossible. Granted! Will you be patient? No trampling. No crying out if I'm late. No flooding all the police stations with phone calls. OK? No yelling at my mother. No throwing away the toaster because it is not toasting fast enough. Is that all? What's this? Finally, the only thing installed here is this telex. Damnit, he's selling it! What is he selling? The most beautiful Etruscan vase ever unearthed More beautiful than the one in the New York Metropolitan. - Placide! They're selling it! - What? The vase? Yes! And Pierre Niox will have it! You hear me? Pierre Niox will have it! I've waited 20 years. 20 years since it slipped through my fingers because I was broke. The message! The sale takes place on March 15. You will be busy on March 15th. You are insufferable. You know this vase by heart. I saw it 20 years ago! - It was not changed. - What if I had changed? Not a chance unfortunately! Do you want me to help you? It's the most beautiful vase in the world. You will never have it, Pierre. Why? You know why. The biggest museums will be there. You don't have a quarter of their resources. I want this vase, Maurice, do you understand? And I'll find the money.. Why are they selling the vase? The heirs are very wealthy. They're dogs who only like money. Not like the old Mittois. He didn't buy it for love of money. These things never work! Come on, faster! You'll win a couple of seconds. What's the use? Minutes. Yes...Yes. No. It's his secretary. Yes. The Copenhagen Museum. Yes. Hello, Mr. Curator. No. I'm his secretary. Yes, we know. You're interested in the vase? We were talking about it with Mr. Niox. What does he think? He is somewhat guarded. Yes, he's somewhat reserved. He finds it perhaps... perhaps of too late a period. In any case, Mr. Niox is perplexed. Not perplexed, my dear curator, not at all. For me, this vase is from the 6th century, from the finest period. I will buy it at any cost. Sorry? Several of us will try. Well... we'll see! See you soon. I don't understand. This guy trusts your knowledge, and instead of discouraging him, talking nonsense, you labour the point. And you provoke him. Here! It's sweet but what's the occasion? No reason. I drove past a flower market. The flowers are pleasant, but only if you kiss me. How long has it been? Five months? Listen, it was four yesterday and it hasn't changed. I've just been to Cochin Hospital. I saw Machelard. Are you worried? It's not worth alerting the whole medical body because we're having a baby. - You're funny. - No, that's not the point. I needed information: he confirmed what I thought. Nine months are absolutely excessive. I would even say... abusive. What? Absolutely. A child is medically finished at seven months. It has its organs, its limbs... everything. The rest of the time, he dawdles. He what? He dawdles. He's... He's getting fat. He grows up a little, tires the mother and... he pisses the world off. You're kidding! I want this child. It could be here in 3 months. I would see it, I would have it, you understand? I would have it. What are you doing? What's the matter? You're sick, pal, really sick. A son! A child of mine! How I can wait 9 months? - What do the other do? - They die without doing a quarter of what I'd achieved at ten. - How sad! - Listen! All this frightens you because it's new. Because your mother and your grandmother waited 9 months. You want to do like them. You remember your picnics you got bored watching the trains? That was their 9 months. It was tradition, habit. I don't have time to wait 9 months. I go full speed. I must live. Where are you going? That, pal, you will never know. I will make my child at my own pace. Until then, please forget me. She is with you, I know. She isn't, I assure you! Pierre! Ah! Already here. Well, I lost. Edwige said you would be there within 30 minutes and I said 3 hours. Where is she? - I lost 100 francs. - Where is she? She's very busy. She's preparing a child for you. She needs to have some peace, you got that? To see her again, leave her alone! She's still my wife! What's becoming of me? She asked you to take her place? Yes exactly. What? But it's not a good deal! I am a virgin. As virgin as can be. And you don't make me want to take the plunge! Ah, Pierre. Maurice just called. Freeman is trying to buy the vase before the sale. Hurry up! There is another flight at 5:20 pm. It's no use... I will have it. We still have 5 minutes. All right! Once there, what will you do? - What's necessary. - That tells a lot! I'll convince the heirs that if they wait for the sale, they'll get much more than Freeman's offer. It's not sure. My rhetoric will convince them. You'll see! Watch out! In the meantime, hire a detective to follow each member of Edwige's family. She's cheating on you? Of course not. She is in hiding. I want to know where. Who must they follow? The mother? The sister? Everybody. The mother, the sister, the maid, the dog, everything. - 116, Lyons. - Boarding gate is closed Sir! Sir! All right! Blood pressure is somewhat low. You're exhausted. But that was to be expected. You find a way, you give me a stimulant I have a plane to catch. Where exactly did you feel the pain? - Here? - Yeah! Higher! You're really fit! No fat! Not like you, you can't say the same. Full of coq au vin and Beaujolais. There? It must be the stomach. You eat too fast. You must have an air pocket We'll do a fluoroscopy. There is an air pocket, but it's not that huge. I'll do an electrocardiogram to be safe. Don't move. It'll take two minutes. It's ready? Yes, I'll start. What can my heart have to say to you? Are you going to leave me tied up for long? Tell me, before the airport accident did you feel pain when making an effort? when running or going up stairs? No. Why? What's the matter? No... there's stuff on your electro... Stuff? What stuff? Problem with our coronaries. You must be hospitalized. - Are you kidding? - Not at all. Coronary insufficiency. You're probably having a threat syndrome. Threat of what? A heart attack. Are you sure? No, I'm not sure. But it's likely. So I'm keeping you under surveillance. Anticoagulants and the whole caboodle. Handle things as you want but I won't go to hospital. I should get you to sign a waiver. All right. Where do I sign? Listen to me: you go home and you go to bed. You'll get an injection every 6 hour. I'll send a nurse with medicine. You mustn't leave your bed. Come into the office, I'll write a prescription. Might I take my plane afterwards? Dear Freeman! - What a surprise! - You and your little games... I'm starting to be really fed up! Coffee? Whisky? I was about to... What did you tell the Mittois? The Mittois, what are they? A secret organization? - A religious sect? - Listen, we agreed: I prepared the contract. When I come back, all falls down. They're waiting for the auction. They are absolutely right: in their place, I would have done the same. And strange coincidence, I hear that you came to see them in the meantime. - Simple courtesy visit. - Niox, we'll get this vase. No, Freeman: I'll get it. You're no match. Regarding this vase, Freeman, I have something that neither you nor any museum in the world have which is irresistible: passion. And you intend paying the vase with it? The Mittois are waiting for something much more concrete. Don't wave your dollars in my face, Freeman: it's ugly and it's crude. Passion allows everything, Freeman: it is the weapon and the strength of the lonely man. Against a single determined man, your commissions and your advice are useless. A man alone is indivisible... consistent and voracious. Sorry... I will have this vase, Freeman I will have it because all of me is determined to possess it Against that, your dough and your schemes don't stand a chance. See you on March the 15th, Freeman. You are insane. Completely. And happy to be. I don't like you, Freeman. Never come back. You are no better than your private detectives and you are wasting your time. - You were to call me on Thursday. - Stop having me followed. I kept my promise: that's why I had to do it myself. Hey, since I'm here, at least report back to me. She's fine. The child turned. Turned! He moved? He's just like me! No, it's normal in the 7th month. That's all? No answer to my letter? No. Tell her that her husband had a heart attack and his wife was not with him. It is true? Should I tell her? Do you believe everything you are told? I think she loves you. So? You are crazy, Pierre. You're not going to part with all this It took you 20 years... How much? You know what it's worth. It's huge. It's not half the price of the vase though. You underestimate your possibilities. Old fox... I know what you can get out of my small stash. Come on... sell all this. And the other half? I'll find it! I will sell your apartment, mine, the Bois-Ros? house. I will borrow money, but I'll get this vase, Hear me? It's mine. It... Pierre! I want some water. I'm okay. No heart condition anymore? No time for that! - How is Edwige? - You didn't get my letter? I did, but I like you to tell me about her. She is like a woman who is 8 months and 15 days pregnant. No message today? Yes. She asked me to tell you that she misses you more and more and that... - And? - It is not easy. Make a little effort. That she kisses you everywhere. At times, I really don't understand my sister. I might be able to explain. You won't have an affair with your sister-in-law. I don't like playing the repertoire. You love Edwige? Strange question! Your museum is gruesome. - I don't think so. - It is! Will you be able to love this child? It will be a boy. To elude this? Death? I don't give a damn about death. I screw it. I'll take care of it when it comes. When you were 10, you didn't cry at night thinking about it? No, I had other things to do. - The women. - Among others. You're pretty pleased with yourself, aren't you? I wonder why. What did you do in 40 years except accumulating dough? A bunch of money you don't even care about and that you are ready to exchange for a vase. A vase? Mittois' vase? A dream, if you prefer, which you're interested in because you don't own it yet. - but as soon as you have it... - I will have it. you will look elsewhere. You are incapable of taking the time to love something or someone. Take time? Why? We don't take the time to love: we love, that's all. Love stops you? Me, it revives me. It's like a journey. It's the journey that counts, not where you go. Have you ever thought about that? Only since I met you. - I hate myself. - Why? You thought this kiss was to Edwige? You're wrong. It was to you. It's easy. Don't believe that. You are glad? Overjoyed. The Washington Museum sent Freeman. You don't stand a chance. Capital error. Big museums have huge budgets but limited by their boards of directors. Mine is ridiculous but limitless. You are going to ruin. I should have you locked up. They would quickly get bored in the sales rooms. They would come and get me quickly. - Thank you! - See you tomorrow. What do you mean? Certainly not. You're not coming to the sale? You think I'm a beginner? Who is your bidder? - Placide? - You will know soon enough. Want to know what will happen if you get your vase? - No. - You will take it home, sleep with it, at lunch time put it in your dining-room. After lunch, you will examine it closely - Yes! - At midnight, you'll have looked it over After you'll never watch it. - It's obvious. - So what? So what? You forgot what comes next, buddy. After the sale, what happens? telexes, phone calls... I vanish for a couple of weeks. You say that I won't sell the vase or that I might offer it to the Louvre Museum. When I come home, they're all there, on the landing, their tongues hanging. All I have to do is bend down and pick up. Hello, Beno?t? Hello, Placide speaking. I would like a table for Mr. Niox. 13:30! At 1:30 p.m. Yes, for one. As close to the phone as possible. Is that so? Very well thank you. It's even better: you will have a phone on your table. I still don't understand. The sale is at 2:30 p.m. You won't have finished lunch. Hence the telephone! S?bastien, at what time do you open the doors? 14:15, Mr. Niox. - Placide will be there at 2. - All right, sir. At 2 p.m., you take a place here. You call the restaurant, I pick up and we block the line. At 2:20 p.m., you give me a physiognomy. Dutertre will be in the room. He will update you. - Who will bid up? - Vivien. - Ah well... - He's my secret weapon. From here, I'll see and I will hear, but I won't know who's bidding for the others. Dutertre will Know. You will see him. - 1 finger: Mildenstein. - Two, Steven. - 3, Freeman. - 4 fingers, Fritz. Mr. Niox, you're being called from the car. It's urgent. St Joseph's maternity hospital. St Joseph maternity? Oh, for God's sake! Pierre Niox here. A son! 3 kg, what does it mean? That he weighs 3 kg, I understood, but what does that mean? That he is in good health. What about the mother? It went well? Thank you, miss. I'm coming. - Mrs. Niox, please. - Room 37, First floor. Pierre! - How is he? - Sorry? The baby! how is he? I... I haven't seen him. Are there any complications? - No. No... - What about Edwige? - I didn't go into the room. - But why? Come, Marie, I need you. You don't need anyone. I do. Today, I do. Come, I'll explain. You will excuse me, but your son, by now, I don't find him beautiful. Is that peeling normal? And his being red? It's normal, yes. You're offended? A little. Have you heard from Pierre? His sale starts in an hour. He will get his vase. Yes. And you, he got you? Almost. I don't know what's going to happen. But I know that if he wants me, he will get me. I should have told you earlier. Why? No. I loved Pierre because he is a man who moves. That's also why I'll lose him But you didn't hope you'd keep him for a while? Never. So this one, what is it? A souvenir? Oh no! More than that... If I had a normal husband, he would be here with flowers and a silly smile. And he would kiss me. So? So kiss me! Hello, Mr. Niox. - Hello. - Hello, Mr. Niox.
