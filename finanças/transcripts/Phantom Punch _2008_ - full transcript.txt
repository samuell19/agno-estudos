Back it up! Back up, man. - Can we get a picture of him? - Back off, man. - What do you think about everything that's happened? Do you feel you deserve to win? - Back up! Come on, man. Give him room. Give him room! Sonny... Back it up! Back it up! - Ah! Come here! Come here! Come here! - Come on, get out. It's all right. It's all right. I got it. I got it. What's on your mind here? What's on your mind? You have to talk about it. You're gonna be all right. You're gonna be all right. - Hey, man. Give me a cigarette. I said, give me a cigarette. Big Lester. - What's wrong with you, man? You must be out of your goddamn mind, man. - We're fine. Okay, all right. - What's wrong with you, man? - You don't want to do this. Just pick up big Lester. It's okay. - Man, this ain't over. - Yeah, I know. It never is. - Watch your back, man. - Hey, take big Lester to the infirmary; Come on. It's all right. He just slipped on the water. You come on with me. - No, I'm fine right where I am. - Did you look over there? Now, I know he's not the brightest of all the guards, but he's going to realize that something's not right down here. Why don't you just come on with me and... Come on. Good. Hey, Mason. - One more. One more. Come on, you got it. - Why are we here? - Well, not only am I a chaplain. I'm also athletic director. - So what that got to do with me? - I figure with your strength and your power you might want to join our boxing league here. - Y'all got a boxing league? - Oh, yes, sir. Got some pretty tough contenders too. - Who the champ? - Actually, you just knocked him out. It's big Lester. Sonny. Sonny, come on. Get up. First boxing lesson. Come on, get up.

Let's look at your legs. Come on. You're standing like a pencil. Back foot back, that about 45—that's it. Let that, your back foot... Just up on your toes a little. That's where your power's gonna come from, all right? Let's try it again. All right. That's it. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Keep it in circles. Keep it in circles. Double up on the jab. That's it. That's it. That's right. That's good. - That's girl stuff. - It's not girl stuff. It's working your legs. What are you going to do, stand there and let them hit you? Boxing's half about the feet. You got back up there and you jump rope. We're going to start again from the beginning. Let's go. Boxing is dancing. It's all—half is leg work. Keep coming back. That's it. Bob and weave. Keep your eyes on him. Keep your eyes on him. 29, 30, 31, 32. Keep going. 33... He's got a long reach. He's got a long reach.

Come on now. Now, check this out. I want a good, clean fight, all right? If you guys decide to get dirty, I can't do nothing for you. Ain't no such thing as scorecards. Y'all got to take that shit out in the yard. Match doesn't start until I beat the bucket. You dig? You dig? Make it a clean fight. Come on, man. Kick his ass. Knock his ass out. All right, let's go, baby. Let's go. Come on, now. Here we go. All right, go. Big Lester, big Lester. Right, left, right. That's right, left, right. That's what I'm talking about, baby. - You forgot the footwork. - Let's score while Sonny has his breath. He ain't got nothing on you, baby. - Hands up! Hands up! - Big Lester! - Big Lester! Big Lester! Big Lester! - Get up, Lester! - Sonny Liston! Sonny Liston! - Sonny Liston! Hey, Sonny, man, look... - All right. All right. - All right. All right. How's big Lester? Come on. 11,12,13,14. 1,2, 3,4, 5. Don't forget the legs. Keep the legs loose. Now, this guy's a different kind of fighter. He likes to dance around. If he does, just cut off the ring. Stay in his eyes. Stay in his eyes. - Come on, we got Sonny Liston, boxing state champ, and over here we have... What's your name, brother? It don't even matter. I'm just going to just call you, uh, evil negro turtle. Evil negro turtle. All right, evil negro turtle versus Sonny Liston. Here we go. All right. - Look at that big guy's head, man. Last time I seen a head that ugly, I put a rubber on it. - Away from him. - Come on, Sonny. Sonny. Come on, man. - Oh! Oh, that's it. Can you hear me down there? Uno, dos... Fuck. Man, you out. You out. Prison state boxing champion. What's his name? Sonny, Sonny, Sonny, Sonny Liston. That's what I'm talking about. - Stop! Stop! Sonny, enough! Enough! That's enough! That's enough! - "Liston is... UN... "B—b—b... B-e-a-t." - Unbeatable. - "UN-b—b—b..." - Beatable. Nd. "E-a" is a "e" sou - no, man. To hell with this. - You just got to be patient, Sonny. - Why? Why I got to be patient? I'm going to be the heavyweight champ of the world. Why I got to be patient? - You get out to here tomorrow. Two years on a five-year sentence, that is because you bettered yourself. There are people that don't want to see you get out of here, but because you bettered yourself, they can't deny you. - Getting out of here tomorrow for doing the same stuff I've been doing all my life: Knocking motherfuckers out. You know what's gonna keep me out of here? - What? - Knocking motherfuckers out. - Can I help you? - Sonny Liston. - You can't be Sonny Liston, because he was supposed to be here yesterday. - My first day out. I had to get some pussy. You make that the last time you show up here without calling, you hear me? - Well, who the hell are you? - I'm the man that's gonna change your life, pal. I'm Caesar novak. I got a lot of friends in this town, a little power, respect. You got it? - I got it. - Father alios tells me that you're gonna be the next heavyweight champion of the world. -Mmhmm. - He's sent me a lot of fighters through the years. He's never said that about anyone. Should we gamble on you? - Bet the bank. - Is there something wrong with your eyes, mister? - Well, I wouldn't be much of a gentlemen if I let a pretty lady just walk in the cold. - Well, thank god I'm pretty, and I'll tell you what, Mr. Gentleman, you can just keep moving right along, seeing that I don't take rides with strangers. - Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. I ain't no stranger. Everybody around here know me. Name's Sonny, Sonny Liston. - That mean boxer? - Girl, I just can't win with you, now, can I? - Well, no. You're not doing a very good job so far. - Well, I ain't going to let you stand here in the cold. This here my driver's license. That'd be my address. Take it. I'm going to give you my keys. You take my car, you bring it to my house tomorrow. - And how are you gonna get home? - I'm gonna run. - It says here you live all the way out in Clark. That's almost ten miles away. - Well, then I better get going. - Hey! Hey! Mister! That's why they call it falling in love falling in love falling in love do you remember when we first met? - Well, I guess I'm just a little impressed, Mr. Liston. - I heard you were looking for a cutman, and I am looking for work. - Catfish. - All right, boxers. Center of the ring. All right, boxers. You received your instructions in the dressing room. I want a good, clean fight. Shake hands. Ding! Corner! Corner! - One, two, three, four... - One, two... Ten. You're out! - Corner! - Come on! Come on! Come on! - Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, he's out! - Six, seven, eight, nine, ten. - So you gave up prison life for this? - I ain't going to do that. - Thank you. - I've been here for three months. Why don't you have a seat? Three months. You just now— you come to see me. - Well, I met someone. - Hey, O’Brien. O’Brien, not now. Not now. Last I heard, you were meeting someone just about every night, so... No, this one, she's special. Her name Geraldine. - Geraldine. How long? - About three, four months. - That's really good, Sonny. I know she must be a wonderful lady. Well, I wanted to come see you fight, but you don't have anything scheduled, so... - Everybody running from me. They know they get in that ring with me, I'm going to act like the animal they call me in the papers. See, all that did was make me stronger. You taught me in prison, no weapon formed against me shall prosper, so now I can't be beat. - Maybe not by an opponent. - What you mean? - It means you don't beat yourself, Sonny. Pride—pride is one of the deadly sins. - In that ring, I'm a deadly sin. - All right. Sonny, can I buy you lunch? You got time? I'm going to take a step out. You probably have to sign an autograph for father O’Brien there. He's a big fan. - I told you, you ain't getting none until you marry me. - Okay. - Okay? - Let's go in house now. - Hey, sport. What are you doing just sitting in the car? It's time to go home. - In a minute. - I live right there. - I said now, boy. - Now, I know you ain't talking to me, 'cause I don't see no boys around here. - Get out of the car. Now. - Wait, officer. This is my woman, and what kind of man I be, I let you call me boy in front of her? - Oh, I see. - Oh, you see what? - I see you a smart-ass nigger. Now get your black ass out of the car now. - Okay, baby. You wait here. - Put your hands on your head! - Please. - And tell that hooker to get out of the car too. - Sonny! Sonny! Stop it, Sonny! Stop! Sonny, stop! - Freeze! Let's go. That's it. Come on. Move it. - Sonny. - Hi. I got us a new house. My cousin's renting it to us. And when we get there, I'm going to make love to you like you ain't never had it before. - Mmm. - I been reading books. - And on the way, we're going to stop at the justice of the peace and get married. Did you say something? - No. - Good. Well, let's go. - Congratulations, Mrs. Liston. - Congratulations, Mr. Liston. You were meant for me undeniably you're all I need it was written some place long ago I'd be smitten by your first hello - Good day for hunting. - Hey, hand me my bullets. Where my bullets at? You forget them again? Dumbass. You know why I hate your ass? Because you're a foreign object to life. Put your hands on the truck. Now, I don't want to hear nothing from you. - Ah! Ah! Ugh! - Sonny. Sonny. Shh. Shh. It's okay. My baby's gone she don't know what she's missing ooh, my baby's gone she don't know what she's missing - Sonny, I got to run, all right? - What's going on? - I got to talk to you later, Sonny. - Sonny, who is it? - Huh. Oh, baby. - Why don't you answer me, and why did you leave the front door open? It's freezing out here. - My, my, my. - Whose car is that in our driveway? - Oh, look at them whitewalls. And that grille. That's that new one. Holy... - Sonny boy. - What up, Caesar? - You ready to get the fight you deserve? - I'm ready to be champ, if that's what you're talking about. - All right. I have to go to Vegas this weekend. I'm buying a house there. I'm going to sit down with some people, people who could help you get a shot at the title. Know what I mean? - Yeah, I know what you're talking about. - Good. So I'm going out on a limb for you. Can you stay out of jail for me? Good man. - Sonny, let's go do some shadow. Come on. - Go to work. - That jelly roll move. - Ah, madon. Yeah, look at that, huh? Now, that's beautiful, huh? What's that? So what about my guy, huh? - He's unmanageable. Have you seen his arrest record? - Nico, with all do respect, who are we to judge an arrest record? Huh? Am I right? - Yeah, when we get pinched, it's for legitimate crimes, right? Not fucking small-time shit. Come on. - He's right. He's nothing but trouble. - This guy is going to be the next heavyweight champion of the world. The heavyweight champion of the world. We're going to let him walk into someone else's camp? Huh? Come on. Let me handle this. He's going to be a fucking cash cow. - I like you. - Trust me. Let me handle it. - It's against my better judgment. Don't let this guy change my opinion of you. - He won't. We got a winner here. It's going to be like a gravy train. All right? - You listen to me, one day, one of these could be yours. - New car. - Yeah. - I guess you can really take the nigger out of the ghetto, but you can't take the ghetto out of the nigger. - Sonny. Sonny. Sonny. - Keep coming, boy. You try that, see what happens this time, hmm? If you ever get a chance to fight Patterson, he's going to whup you something good, boy. Have a fantastic night, boy. - Sonny, no. Come on. - Sonny. - Any word from the Patterson people? - Patterson? - Yeah, he can't keep running from me. I'm the number one contender, and even the president said he should fight me. - You're right. Well, the thing is, Sonny, that the Patterson camp called this morning, and the fight is all set. September 25: Liston versus Patterson. How is that, huh? Just get your ass home and get packed. I need you to get on a plane with me tonight and go to Vegas and do some press. We'll fool around a little bit, check out my new house. No wives allowed. Right? First time I ever saw your face takes me back to our special place everything was perfect, time and space - There he is. - Hey, how are you, Caesar? - How are you? - Good to see you. - Bill Macky. Sonny, from sports world boxing. - How you be, Mr. Macky? - Very well, thank you, Sonny. - Thanks for asking. - Have a seat. - Yeah, let's just... - Let's get started. - Let's get going. So, bill, what do you got for Sonny? - Well, Sonny, why do you think Patterson's giving you a shot at the title? - Because it's the right thing to do. Sonny is a very talented, gifted fighter. He's the number one contender in the world, and he's earned it. - Now, you've seen Patterson fight, obviously. What makes you think you stand a chance? - He wouldn't be here if he didn't stand a chance, bill. - So do you feel the pressure of the negro race on you to win this fight? - They're both Negroes, and I'm sure no matter what the outcome is, they're both going to represent their race with dignity. Right, Sonny? - Right. - No offense intended, Sonny, but my money's on Patterson. - Yeah, no offense, Mr. Macky, but you're about to lose your money. I spent my whole life knocking motherfuckers out. - Well, then perhaps you care to comment on your extensive criminal past, including assaulting police officers and your alleged ties with organized crime. - What did you say? Get that fucking smile off your face. You fucking son of a bitch. Get out! - What the fuck! - Motherfucker! Here! You never insult my fighter that way. Ever! Get the fuck out of here! Fucking prick! I guess that didn't go too well. Let's go get a drink at the pink dragon. You can meet my new lady. She's a singer there. All right? - That's a good right hand you got. - Learned from the best, man. Way beyond compare Do, do do, do do, do if you want my love just take all of me if you want my love just simply set me free if you want me love - Gino! How you doing, buddy? How's your family? Just treat treat, treat me right - Say hello to Sonny. Sonny, Gino. My love just take me there if you want my love just let me know you care - You all right? - I want you to meet somebody, Frankie. - Hey, champ. Nice to meet you. - Next heavyweight champ of the world. Just treat treat, treat me right - There she is. Put your tongue back in your mouth. - Please. It's a kind of love that is rich and fair love that I want is not for everyone but for that one man that wants more than fun - No, no, no. All right. All right. If you want my love ♪just take all of me if you want my love just simply set me free if you want my love I will give to thee just treat treat, treat me right just treat treat, treat me right just treat, treat, treat, treat Tre-e-e-eat treat me right - Bravo! - She's good. - Whoo! Thank you. I'm going to take a little break, but I will back, if you treat me right. - There she is. Why do you have to embarrass me like that, huh? - Because I love you. - Sit down. - I want you to meet somebody. This is Sonny Liston, the next heavyweight champ of the world. Hey, Gino. Come on, I'm starving over here. - Ah, ladies first. - Oh, finally. A gentleman. You're a gentleman, Sonny. I'll have the escargot, please. - And I'll have what the lady's having. - Really? You like escargot? - Yeah. - Yeah, it's one of my favorites. Why? - You just didn't strike me as a kind of guy who likes to eat snails. - Yeah. And a whiskey please. A double. - A seven and seven too, hey, Gino. - So tell me, Sonny, when you're in that ring by yourself and everybody's cheering you, how good does that feel? - Well, I can't tell you, 'cause most of the time, I don't be the one they're cheering for. - See, Sonny's more like the bad guy, huh? - Just the way I like it. - Caesar. - Hey, Bobby Zazo. - Farah, can I talk to you? - Hey, there's someone else here. - Where's your manners? - No. - I don't mean to be rude. I know who you are, Sonny. Actually, I'm a fan, and my family and I were very interested in managing your career, but it seems Caesar here took the flight out to St. Louis before we did. - That's something else I stole from him, right? You know what, Bobby? I'll give you another chance to win her back. Me and Sonny are gonna go talk business in the back, but after that, give it a rest. Sit over here. Here you go, Zazo. - I'll be right back, all right? - Okay. - Wow. What a mouth. - Caesar, go. - Farah, look... - No, Bobby. You look. We had our thing. - Our thing? Is that what you call it? Me taking a hooker off the street, making something out of her, making her respectable, seeing something in her that these dumb fucks couldn't see even if they had a magnifying glass? That's what you call "our thing"? Cat got your tongue, you ungrateful bitch? - This conversation is over. - Fifth and main. Fifth and main is where I found you giving blow jobs for ten bucks a pop. But you know what I just figured out? You're still a hooker. You just charge more for your blowjobs. - I said, this conversation's over. - So I'm out, huh? - Nah, she's yours for now, until something better comes along. - So you admit I'm better, huh, Bobby? - Hey, Caesar. When you gave her that last kiss, I was just wondering, how does my dick taste? - Son of a bitch! -Hew no, no! You two stop! I'll bust y'all right up! - You're fucking dead. You hear me? - Fricking jerk-off. There's gonna be all kinds of ramifications 'cause of this asshole. You got a fight to worry about, Sonny. Come on. You got to get out of here. - You sure? - I'm sure. All right, honey. Let's go. - What, are you fucking stupid or something? - No. - What do you think we said to his request? - What request? - To have you whacked. - You said no. - What makes you think that? - Because you're pissed off at me. Usually, when you want to whack somebody, you're like, "hey, Caesar, how you doing? "Caesar, you hungry? "Want some breakfast, Caesar? "Hey, oh, ham and eggs, sausage. "Come on, Caesar, "I got a couple of broads down the street. "Come on, me and you, we're going to get laid tonight." Come on. - This time, you're right. But if you're gonna give a guy a beating, it's nobody's business. But you don't hit him over the head with a bottle. Now, you're going to have to give him ten grand. - Ten grand? Are you kidding me? All right, I mean... - It's his request. That's what you're going to do. - All right, I'll give it to him. But I don't have it on hand. I mean... - Don't make an asshole out of me. I don't need a war. Capisce? - Capisce. - Nico will be over later to talk about Sonny. - You hear? - I hear. - I know. - Okay? - Okay. - Hey, Nico. - Hey, beautiful. - Come on in. - Thank you. How are you? - Good. - Good. - Caesar's just down by the pool. - All right. - Can I get you a drink? - Ah, no thanks, sweetheart. - I'm not staying. - Okay. - I love what you've done to the house. - Caesar. What are you doing? - Nice to see you, Nico. - You too, darling. - Ooh. - I'll be right there, hon. - That is a sweet girl you got there. - Yeah, she is. What's this? What do I owe this to? Holy shit. - Yeah, take it to Chicago and bet on the fight. - All of it? - No, I brought all of it so I could bet half. Yes, all of it. - Wow, you know, good choice, Nico, because Sonny's gonna tear this guy apart. - On Patterson. - No, no. Trust me. There's no way Sonny's gonna lose against this guy. - Not if you tell him to take a dive. - What? - Yeah. - Take a dive? No. Can't do that. - Caesar, listen to me. Don't fuck this up. - All right, let me see what I can do. - Now go get me Savino's ten grand so I can get out of here. Be right there, babe. Sonny boy? - I said leave me be. - Sonny, you got a minute? Huh? I need to ask you a favor. - What? - I wouldn't ask if it wasn't absolutely necessary, but it's not just me here. - And what is it? My mind got to be right for this fight, so you say what you got to say. - I really need you to win this one. - Done. What else? - Just win, that's it. - done. - All right. - Catfish. Who the hell is it now? What you doing here? - Well, I would not miss this for the world, Sonny. I mean, I know it's five minutes before the fight. I did call, and Geraldine wanted me to surprise you. - I don't know what to say. - Well, then you don't say anything. Just go out there and you take what is yours. - Good luck. - All right. - Whoa! - Focus! - All right. - Boxers. Boxers. You received your instruction in the dressing room. I want a clean bout. Hands up at all times. Touch gloves, and let's box. - Well, good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I'm Jack Wells. It's now time for the main event, the fight that we've all been waiting for. The challenger, Sonny Liston, versus the heavyweight champion of the world, Floyd Patterson. A lot of controversy's swirling around this one, folks. - This fight better be good, man. - Alleged ties to the mob. The NAACP has even said themselves they would prefer Patterson remain the champ. The fight is about to begin. - Here we go, boys! Ding! - Box! - All right, Sonny! Don't forget the legs! Don't forget the legs, Sonny! - Break it up. Break it up! - He's dancing! He's dancing! Cut off the ring! - Keep dancing. Come on, baby. Come on. - To the body! To the body! - Give it to him! - Guys, come on. Break it up. - Stop running, you fuck! Excuse my French. - He ain't got nothing on you, Sonny. - Yeah, baby. Come on. - Beauty. - That's it. - Yeah! - Oh, yeah! Yeah! - One, two, three, four, five, six... - Seven, eight... - Nine... - Ten. Down! - Sonny Liston is the new heavyweight champion of the world. - They all said he couldn't do it. Everybody was against him, but he proved them all wrong. - I love you, Geraldine. I love you. - We love you, Sonny. - We love you. We love you, man. - What are the chances of a rematch? - We'll have a rematch any time, any place, right? - That little piece of shit. - You know how much money you lost tonight, huh? Do you know how much fucking money you lost? - He's going to step into a fucking world he didn't know existed. - Sonny Liston, baby! They said America didn't love him, but they do love him. - Ain't nobody ever give me a chance, so I thank you. - You the champion... - You ever want a rematch, you got it. - Can we get a picture, Sonny? - Sonny? I want to be a good champion... Somebody that people could look up to. Lord, if you let bygones be bygones, I'd be a champion you'd be proud of too. Amen. All right. Time to talk to the press. Let them meet the new champion of the world. - I like the sound of that, baby. Let's go. Nobody out here. - What you talking about, catfish? - I'm telling you, ain't nobody out here, man. - I'm the heavyweight champion of the world. Sparks just fly right out of the blue there's no way I can't deny - Hey, Caesar. - Hey, Nico. What are you doing here? - Savino said to pick you up. - Yeah? - Yeah. Listen, I got some great news. - Hey, hey, how's the flight, huh? - It was fantastic. - Oh, good. - Hungry or something? - Want something to eat? - Yeah, I'm hungry. Why are you being so nice to me? - What? - We should call savino. - Hey, Caesar. Let's go. - Excuse me. - Come on, get out of the way. Vamoose. - This should be over here. Think. Think. Think. - It's ringing. Just hold on. Come on, answer. - You hear a phone? - Hey, hey, stop! Stop! - I got to do everything. - Get out! - Hey! He's going to—wait a minute. Wait a minute. - Hello? - Hello. Savino. Hey, it's me, Caesar. Yeah, I know. I should be dead right now, right? But listen, I didn't do it. I didn't tell Sonny to take the dive. - Yeah, I noticed. - But I didn't bet on Patterson either. - So what does that mean? We didn't lose $100,000? - No, we didn't lose it. - I bet it all on Sonny. The odds were crazy. We made $1.2 million. - You have more lives than a cat. - Yeah, so do you mind saving your bullets and calling your dogs off of me? Please? - Put him on the phone. - All right. - He wants to talk to you. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. - Hey, what's up? Capisce? - You sure? - What do you mean "you sure"? - All right. Yeah, bye. - You were going to really kill me? - What am I supposed to do, huh? What do you want from me? - What do I want from you? Taxi! - Do you want to ride with me? - Huh? Yeah. - Sonny Liston, the champ. Hey. - Hey. - You're in the newspaper today. - Well, I'm the champ. - Think I can get an autograph? For my kids? - Sure. - Yeah, their names are Richard and Sarah. See? I told you he's a dumb nigger. See, Sonny? It says here that niggers don't even like you. - You know, you're a goddamn disgrace to the sport of boxing. - You're a goddamn disgrace to assholes. - Put your hands behind your back. - Yeah, what for? - Driving while intoxicated. - Well, wouldn't I have to have something to do with driving? - You was about to. - Well, your daddy was about to sleep with a woman, but instead he slept with a female dog. - That's it. - Take one more step, and I'll blow your face clean off! Don't! Smack! Smack! Smack! - That'll do. You can take them cuffs off him and the gag. - Ah! - You enjoy beating up cops? You'd already be dead if not for your celebrity. So this is your first and last warning. Get out of my town, or I'm gonna kill you. - Sonny. Shit. You all right? Those bastards fucked you up? Come on. I just gave them a ton of money. Those pricks. Get up, big guy. - I ain't do nothing this time. - I know. You and Geraldine go some place where they're going to treat you like a human being. Come on, champ. - So how you like it? - I like it, but I'm not going to get used to it. Lord knows we don't stay anywhere for very long. - Oh, I guess that's my fault, huh? - No. I'm the one who keeps on beating up the police. - Look, well, Gerry, what the hell was I supposed to do? - I don't know, Sonny. But you can't keep beating up everybody. Save it for the ring. - Okay, well, next time, I'll just make sure to lay down and die. - They are scared of you. Now, that might be good for the ring, but in the real world, you're just a big, black, angry man, and they're scared of you, and if you don't control that temper of yours, one day, somebody who fears you is gonna kill you. - Patterson's camp keeps calling me. They want a rematch, but the money's got to be right. How long do you think it'll take you to get ready? - About a hour. - About an hour. All right, tough guy. - Ah, you have a phone call. - All right, I got to take this phone call. Don't go anywhere. - My usual. -So... How does it feel to be the champ? - It feel all right. Ah, Caesar over there. - I know. I see him. So, Sonny, how's your wife? - What? - How's your wife? - Why are you worried about my wife? - I'm not worried. - I'm just asking; That's all. - Yeah, well, my wife is fine. Look, farah. Caesar care a lot about you, and a woman like you could have any man she want. - Are you making a pass at me? - What? - I'm just kidding. Yeah. - My set's up. I have to go sing. You going to be all right here by yourself? - Yeah. Yeah, I'll be all right. - Good. - Excuse me, Mr. Liston. - Good news, champ. - Excuse me, Mr. Liston? One picture. - They want the rematch in about eight months. That work for you? - Yeah, it works for me. - Works for you. Works for me. It works for everybody. All right. Sweet music. Give me your best bottle of bubbly, would you? You think you're macho. You think you're the man, right? You ain't shit, man. - You should have let me drive. - Let you drive? No way. - Because you can't hold your liquor - it's your first week in Vegas. Come here! Big, big fucking... Get over there! - What do we have here? - Take care of my boy. - Who do you two think you are, Davis and Sinatra? - That's right. I'm Sammy Davis. - Yeah, well, then I guess I must be old blue eyes. - Yeah. Would you look at her? She's beautiful. - Yeah, she is. - If the champ thinks you're beautiful, then that's all she wrote. I could have loved you in another lifetime. You see, well, she been around the block a few times. She's beautiful, but, you know, I mean, I ain't the first guy... - He's drunk. - That Bobby Zazo, piece of shit, I mean, come on, honey. Ain't I good enough for you? - Come on, man. You're drunk. - Yeah, I know. Come on. - I don't understand how you... Blow jobs? Bobby Zazo? Piece of shit. - Here you go, champ. - Thank you. - Farah. - Yeah? - You know he ain't mean no harm. - Yeah, not everyone can be like you, champ, but it's nice to know that you think I'm beautiful. - Come on, babe! Hurry up! - Have a good night. - The heavyweight champion, Sonny Liston, is a man who won that title last September at Comiskey park, Chicago, in two minutes and six seconds. - What do you think's gonna happen this time, Caesar? - Same thing that happened last time, pal. - All right, gentlemen. I want to have a nice, clean fight, watch below the belt. You listen to my instructions at all times. Touch gloves. - Patterson trying to get underneath the champion's great punches. Runs into a right uppercut, which sets up the challenger. - Come on! Come on! - In your corner. You all right? - Yeah! - Box! - Ooh! - The challenger's long right hand grazes the champion's chin, and Liston's countering left hook is on target and sets up the second knockdown. - In your corner, Sonny. - Whoa! - One, two, three, four, five, six... - Out! - Eight! Good to go? - Come on! Come on! Oh! - Okay. We'll see. I'll talk to him. - How you doing, farah? Where's Caesar? He left a message at the gym for me to meet him here. - I left that message for you. - Oh, not that I mind, but why'd you really call me here? - I don't know what I thought. You're right. They say there's a time when your heart will stop singing the blues but I think it's a lie because I don't see the day that I will stop missing you they say there's a day when your love begins fading away but the love that I feel just turns into tears 'cause I can't get over you Oh, darling I love you in the morning I love you in the afternoon - Shh... Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa darling - Bunch of hos. They're going to score some shit. Who are these bitches? Who is this guy? - Why are we sitting here? - Bobby Zazo. - What about him? - He's been telling people around town the fights are fixed. - Why would he do that? - Fuck do I know? It's just bad for business. Farah's been acting strange. I think he's fucking her again. Something isn't right. All I know is, the family had a meeting, and a decision was made. - Look... whoaw. Whoaw. A decision was made? - Yeah. - Well, what we about to do? - Oh, calm down. - If I kill somebody, it got to be for my own reason. - I don't want you to kill anybody. Just put a fucking scare into him. He's got a big mouth. - What you need me for? - Well, who's scarier than you, Sonny? That him? Here we go. Come on. Let's go. Hey, douche bag! - What the fuck do you want? - Let's take a ride. - I ain't got time to go back and forth with you over some dame. - This ain't about a dame this time, Bobby. You got a big fucking mouth, and I told you, it was only a matter of time before it caught up with you. - Fuck you. - I ain't going nowhere. - You hear that? Fuck me? You hear the way he talks to me, Sonny, this piece of shit? - Do you mean to tell me you cocksuckers got the heavyweight champion in the world out here doing muscle work? What a fucking lack of respect for that man. I don't know, champ. Maybe getting with these guys wasn't such a good idea. My family would have never done this to you. The truth is, I've been saying some things I shouldn't have been saying, but we all get a bit drunker than we should sometimes, but for them to send me this fucking prick? A slap in the face is what that is. - I got your prick right here. It was nice seeing you for the last time, you big-headed fucking moose. - Fuck you! - Yeah! - Cocksucking motherfucker. - I heard it was about that big. - Caesar, you something else. - Come on, Sonny. - No, no, no, no. Come on, stop now. Stop. Come on now. Stop. Stop. - Feed me a fry. Hey, baby, I don't know what you think this is, but I ain't the type of man that's gonna be feeding you. I ain't bringing you roses or hugging you under the full moon. So why don't you just sit on that bed, watch some TV or something, let me finish my sandwich? Then we're going to do what we came here to do. That's all. - You think I'm just here because I want some big black stud? Girl... - Is that why you're here? Is that is? What? To take out on me everything the white man has ever done to you? - Oh, yeah, the white man. - Yeah, everything the reporters say about you. Is that it? Because it's not because you're not the type of man that does those sweet things. You just don't want to do them with me. Geraldine... - I told you to keep my wife's name out your mouth, didn't I? - Okay— - didn't I tell you that? - Okay, great, Sonny. Why? Now are you going to hit me? Because that'll really be sticking it to the white folk, if you hit me and fuck me. Wait. Wait. No, no. No, I’m... I'm sorry. - You better get out of my way. - I didn't mean it, Sonny. - I'm out of here. - Please. I get to see you once a week. - Oh, that's it, huh? You're going to miss your once-a-week fuck, huh? - No, that's not it. That's not what I meant. - That's all I'm good for, huh? - Sonny. - Your once-a-week fuck? - Sonny, come on. - Hmm? - Sonny... - Ah! - Sonny. Ah! - That's all I'm good for? Go ahead and look me in the eye and say I'm just good for your once-a-week fuck. - What I meant... - What did you mean? What did you mean? - Don't be like this. - No, you tell me. Tell me. What the fuck did you mean? - Huh? - Sonny. Come on. - What the fuck did you mean? - Come on. Come on. - All set now. World heavyweight boxing title on the line. 31-year—old Sonny Liston, 22-year-old cassias Clay; Sonny the champion, cassias the challenger. Sonny 218, cassias 210 1/2... A 7 1/2 pound weight pool. The capable Barney Felix. Brought to you by theater network television. - All right, Sonny, cassias, you both know the rules, so let's have a good, clean fight. Protect yourself at all times. Good luck to the both of you. Touch gloves. Touch gloves. Okay. Let's do it. - Sonny is feeling out cassias Clay. Clay is dancing and taunting the powerful Liston, pawing at him with that strong left jab. But this youngster has his own style, and it's confusing for the champion to fathom this early in the fight, at least up to now. Sonny Liston may have his hands full tonight. - Cassius Clay on the move, as we see, looking to get Sonny to lunge, with both hands high, mocking the champion. In close range, if you look closely... Although Barney Felix does want them apart at this point, because their hands were tied... Sonny will be the guy that will keep mauling away. I'd like to point out that the champion is strong, durable, takes the good shot. However, he is being out-maneuvered at most points, because this fellow has that awkwardly fast style of going side to side, moving the upper part of his body. Ding! - Sonny, you got this. - Do it. - What are you talking about, man? - Do it. Ding! - Time. Let's go. - Come on, Sonny! Come on! - It looks like his eyes... His eyes are bothering him. Ladies and gentlemen, something got in his right eye. However he's blinking badly. Sonny's gonna try to take advantage of this, but there's not enough time. End of round. - Come on, now. - Big right hand to the body. Clay, with a variety of punches... Startling combinations. Putting punches together, that's his strong point. Ladies and gentlemen, what do you think is going on in Liston's mind right now? I'll tell you what he's thinking. He's thinking he's underestimated this challenger. He's quicker than he thought, and more resilient than he first believed. There goes another one. Sonny wobbles. Sonny wobbles. Cassius has him hurt. Sonny is in trouble. He's in trouble. Clay is punishing him. This young fighter is showing a lot of heart. - Look, we still got this, man. You can't stand there. You got to move, man. You got to move. Come on, man. When you bring your head down, you bring it to him. You cannot stay in one place. - Oh, shut up! - Sonny... - Shut up! It's over. - What are you talking about? - That's it. Tell 'em my shoulder. - What's the matter? - His shoulder. - What? - Right shoulder. His shoulder, man. - That's it. The fight's over. - They might be stopping it. That might be all. Ladies and gentlemen, it appears they're stopping the fight. They are stopping the fight. Something about Liston's shoulder. Liston's shoulder went out. He could not continue. Winner by a TKO in the seventh round: Cassias Clay. Cassius Clay celebrates his victory, goes into the record book with corbett, Tunney, and Braddock as another who brought off one of the great upsets in heavyweight history. - Why did you do it? - "I am the greatest." - Huh? It's just us in here, Sonny. Why did you do it, man? - Because I'm ignorant. That's what you want to do, huh? You will my nature rise. Mm-hmm. - What are you going to do? - Leave. - Gerry, put away the gun before somebody get hurt. - Before somebody get hurt? It's too late. Somebody already got hurt. - She don't mean nothing to me. - Well, you sure mean something to her, 'cause she was ready to stand here and take a bullet with you. Sonny, you know you famous now. You can't just walk into the same hotel every week at the same time and not be spotted. Now, the papers don't know who that white woman is, but they know who you are, and if you could read, you'd probably know this. Do you love her? - Gerry, I told you... - You think I give a shit about what you done told me? Do you love her? - I love you. - Well, you got a funny way of showing it. Well, here's what you're gonna do. You're gonna go find that lady and you're going to tell her that it's over, and you are never, ever going to see her again. Um, you know what else? You should have been training instead of fucking. I hope cassias Clay whips your ass again. - I just saw her leave. How did she find out? - It don't matter. It's over. - No. We just have to be more careful. - No, farah, we're over. - Come on. Sonny, please. Sonny, look at me. Look at me. - All right, let's let him get back to work now. Thank you very much. Okay, you got your picture. Get back to work. Sonny, I don't think they're going to leave unless you speak to at least one of them. - I don't give a fuck. I tried answering their damn questions anyway. - Sonny, you got any comment on the mobster they found shot to death in the desert, Bobby Zazo? You and Caesar novak knew this guy, right? Was he with your family, Sonny? - All right, that's enough. - Come on. - Did you know him well, Sonny? How about I throw you a banana, Sonny? You talk to us then? - What, motherfucker? I'm gonna fucking... - Oh-ho-ho-ho! - I'm gonna fuck you up, motherfucker! - You're an animal! - Motherfuckers! Everybody out! - Sonny. Sonny! Sonny. - I tried with these people. - I know. - But they just hate me. From the day I was born, even my daddy hate me. What is it about me that people hate so much? Clay, with his big mouth and people wanted me to shut him up. For the first time in my life, people were on my side. They looked at my different. They looked at me like a man. - Yeah. - I liked it. But then when it didn't turn out the way they wanted, then just straight back to nigger-ville. - I don't know why you listen to them. When they can't find goodness in themselves, I don't know how they're gonna find it in you. You can't look to them for your validation. You can't look to them for your love, because they will let you down every single time. You're a remarkable man, Sonny. I don't know how else you did all those things. You went from being a prison inmate to the heavyweight champion of the world, and I don't know why that doesn't mean anything to you. Don't let people tell you who you are. Don't let them make you into something you are not. - Good evening. From the central Maine youth center in lewiston, Maine, tonight we have the long-awaited rematch. 15 rounds of boxing for the heavyweight championship of the world. - Sonny boy. This is your night, baby. Can you feel it? - Yeah. - Everybody we know is out there, from Hollywood to hoboken, and the odds are in your favor. Bust him up. - Oh, I'm gonna do that. - Huh! - Here we go. The world's heavyweight title. The big fight. The big night. Lewiston, Maine. Round number one. Sonny Liston in the dark trunks is chasing that man straightaway. Is that a mistake? - Get out the box. Come on, now. Come on. You got to throw something now. You got to throw something. - Beautiful right-hand shot that we saw. It was the best punch thus far, landed by the champion. Halfway through this first round, and Sonny has been shooting mostly... Although he's going to the head now... Mostly toward that body. You know the old story: You kill the body, and the head might follow. Knockdown, ladies and gentlemen, on a right-hand shot. The right-hand shot on the chin. - Come on, baby! Sonny, no! - The right-hand shot on the chin... - You got to get up! - Sonny, come on! Come on! - Come on. - Three... - He's good, man. He's good. - Ref! Get down! He's been down longer than ten seconds. Ref! - That's it! The time is over. - What, are you out of your mind? - What's going on? - The question is, did he even hit him? If he did, it was too fast for my eyes to see. This is a sad day for boxing. The crowd is yelling "fixed" at the top of their lungs. You can hear them in the background. Odds on Sonny tonight, and now this. This kind of thing is what gives boxing a black eye, but tonight Sonny Liston went one step further. He kicked dirt in the face of the sport. At one time, a little over a year ago, he was considered unbeatable, unstoppable. Now he has stopped himself for the second time. Was the fix in? There's only one man in this arena who can answer that question, and Sonny Liston has a lot to answer for. Who loses the most? Tonight, Sonny Liston. - Who did he throw the fight for? - I don't know. I don't know. I don't know what the fuck happened. I don't think Sonny would do that. - The blow barely tapped him. I mean, I've watched this guy take monstrous blows, Caesar. - Somebody's gonna have to talk to him. The man that I love nobody knew the man that I love nobody knew friends would say he's no good for you he's no good he'll only make you blue - How's it going? - Bad. - Did you throw the fight, Sonny? Who's asking? - I'm fucking asking. What's the difference? - If it's savino and Nico, then it makes sense. If it's you, we got a problem. - Why do we got a problem? - Because you should know better. - Goddamn it, that punch barely touched you, Sonny. - Oh, you were in the ring, huh? - Hi, Sonny. - How you doing, farah? - Caesar, would you mind if we leave a little early? I'm not feeling very well. - Yeah, farah, I would mind. You see, I'm sitting here talking business with Sonny. I didn't get you this gig so you can go home early every night. That's the third time this week, for Christ's sakes. We'll leave when I'm done. All right? - I ain't never thrown a fight in my life. Never do you believe me? Do you believe me? - Yeah, because I'm a fucking idiot that'll believe anything you say. - So what now? - You should go home. Let me talk to these guys. I'll be by later. Or they will. Oh, the man the man, the man that I love nobody knew - I told you to go out till I call you and tell you everything's okay. Go to the room. - No, Sonny... - Go the room. - Hey, Sonny. - So what happened? - I put my ass on the line for you. I told them that you've never thrown a fight in your life. - Well, good. That's the truth. - Yeah, but if they find out something different happened, it'd be bad for you and me. - Well, they won't find out, because that's the truth. - I hope not. I also said that you would come up in the ranks and be a champ again. - I will.. - I know. Listen, I got to go home. Farah's waiting for me. Just be careful. - Pasquale. Over there, you see that? What is that? It looks loose to me. - Hey. There he is. - Check that out. - Oh. - Look at him. - Fantastic. - Merry Christmas. - Oh. Buon Natale. - Thanks. You know, this is a good thing. You know why? - Why? - Because it shows people, even though they make a mistake, they can get back on the straight and narrow and do the right thing and can still work themselves up. - Thank you. - Which brings us to our next thing. - What's that? - We need Sonny to take some dives. - Are you sure there's... There ain't another way? - No. - Well, what if he won't do it? - He's got to do it. - Okay. All right. See you later. - Come on. Come on. - Hey, Caesar. Hey, Caesar. - Yeah, what is it? - One another thing. Today me and the fellas, we were doing my collections, right? While we were collecting from that place called hillcrest motel over on fifth. - Yeah? - Anyway, we're sitting around, we're talking about boxing, all of a sudden this guy, he says to me that your boy Sonny used to come there with some dame every week. - So what? - He says it was that singer from the pink dragon. - I knew about that. - You did? - Yeah, I knew all about it. I passed her to Sonny. Bobby Zazo gave her to me. I gave her to Sonny. - You did? - That's right. - Oh, good. Good. No, I... See, I... I understand now. I understand. - You understand? - Yeah. - It's all good. - But a nigger? Huh? ' - hey, who gives a shit, right? Who cares? - All right. Is that you? - Yeah. - I'm in here. - What's going on? What did you do to my clothes? - I heard black is your favorite color. Is that true? - I don't understand. - Don't act surprised. - What are you talking about, Caesar? - You're fucking Sonny. Right? You're fucking him, right? Don't lie to me, bitch. I trusted your ass. Why'd you do that? Huh? Why'd you do that? Huh? Why'd you do it? Get over here, you fucking bitch. How could you do this to me? How could you do this to me? Why? - Please stop it. Please. - Doing what? That fucking— ! Gave you everything. - Caesar. - Why did you humiliate me like that? - Stop it! - You know, you're a whore; I'll treat you like one. I'll fucking treat you like one. That's what this is about. - Ah, Caesar! Stop it! - Come on. Come on, baby. I can— I can do this! I can do it. You like that? You like that, huh? - Oh, yes. - I don't ever want to see you again. Ever get your shit. Get the fuck out of here. Why? - With your right. Come on. There you go. Hold on. Hold on, champ. - Hey. What's up? - I've been calling you. What's wrong? - Nothing. How you doing? - Good. - How's Geraldine? - She fine. Sent her to see her mama for the holiday. - Oh, yeah? That's good. Listen, the bosses, they wanted me to ask you something. - What's that? - They wanted to know, did you have a good Christmas? Yeah. - I'll let 'em know what you said. - So you came all the way down here to ask me that? - Well, you know how they are. When they want to know something, they want to know right away. All right? Finish your work. Hey. He said no. - Look, farah. I don't know if it's a good idea for you to come around here. - Don't worry, then. - I'm just passing through. I just wanted to make sure that you were okay and to say thank you. - Thank you? For what? For making your life crazy? - You still don't get it, do you? Take care of yourself. - Sonny, I'm home. My flight was delayed. Sonny, what are you doing laying down here right now? Sonny? Sonny. What... What's been going on? What is all this stuff? Sonny? Sonny.
