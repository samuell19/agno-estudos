Captioning made possible by LIFETIME TELEVISION Captioning made possible by LIFETIME TELEVISION ( man ) It's like certain memories have been covered over in black. And although I can't see through the pain, I know they're there and they never go away. I'm sure this leaves more questions than answers. Not knowing what's festering under the black is killing me. ( cell phone ringing ) ( man ) Hey, you've reached Jason Darcie. Leave me a message. ( beep ) Hey, sweetie. I called your work and Todd said you weren't feeling well, went home early. I hope you're okay. Listen, my class got canceled so I picked us up some Pad Thai. Hope you haven't eaten. All right, I'll try you at home. I love you, bye. ( phone ringing ) ( Jason ) Hi, you've reached Jason and Lara. Please leave us a message. Thanks. ( beep ) ( Lara ) Why aren't you picking up ? Jason ? Jason ? Jason ? Jason, are you home ? Jason. Jason ? Jason ! Oh, my God ! Jason ! ( siren blaring ) Something must have triggered this. What happened on Friday to make you leave work ? I was installing a sink at this woman's house and... she had a baby and it wouldn't stop crying. It was just crying and crying and... I had this horrible, horrible sense of dread. You know, just... And I couldn't take it anymore. I just had to leave, I had to get out of there. Do you think it has something to do with us wanting to start a family ? No, it's not that, it's not that. Maybe you don't wanna have kids. Lara, I said it's not that, okay ? Come on, do you really think it's that simple, not wanting to have a kid ? I'm just saying. You don't understand... okay ? You don't have these big chunks of your childhood that you wanna remember and they're just not there. You don't know what that's like. ( sighing ) I know-- No, you don't know. You don't know what it's like. To be at work and then to suddenly have these images pop up in your mind, these terrible images, you don't know why they're there. I can't keep doing this, Lara. I can't-- I can't live like this. I just wanna help you. I'm sorry. I just-- I'm tired, okay ? Okay. ( Lara ) What do you suggest ? ( man ) Intensive in-house therapy. I'd like him... to voluntarily commit himself to 30 days at this facility. Your husband needs in-patient treatment. The therapy he's been doing with me on a weekly basis just isn't enough. Our insurance won't cover this. I had to downgrade to a cheaper policy last year. Jason was lucky this time. But you can't be there with him every minute. I wanna do everything I can to get us through this. I just-- I don't understand why he would wanna kill himself. Lara, you know it has nothing to do with you. It's about Jason's pain and it happened long before he ever met you. ( phone beeping ) ( Jason ) We've got the candle worked out, so I guess there's nothing left except the rehearsal, right ? ( Lara ) Great.( man ) Wonderful. Okay, Father, we'll see you on Tuesday. Thank you so much. All right, bye-bye. Bye. Tuesday it is. ( laughing ) Don't be nervous. Babes. Yeah ? I have these three invitations. Which one do you like ? Sounds like a trick question, let me see. Uh... I don't know, I like this one. Really ? Yeah. That's the one I like. Oh, thank God. I thought you would want something more traditional. Well, look, if you already knew which one you liked, why'd you ask me ? Well, because I wanted you to feel like you're involved. Oh, you did, did you ? Very considerate. So the guest list. Hmm. I assume we're not inviting your dad. Or my brother. It doesn't matter, he wouldn't come anyway. He hates these things. ( sighing ) Oh, honey, come on. Look, you're gonna have to trust me on this, okay ? The farther away they are, the better off our wedding is gonna be, okay ? I don't get why you hate them so much. And please don't tell me that it's complicated. Okay, uh... it's complex ? What am I supposed to tell my family when they show up and your family's not here ? We will simply tell them that we ran out of these fancy little invitations you found. ( chuckling ) It's gonna be fine, okay ? ( dialing ) ( man ) So you really think that his brother would loan you the money ? Jason told me that he and Grady don't talk much. They don't, but the Darcie house has been in the family for generations and it belongs to Jason, too. Maybe I can convince Grady to help. Dr. Mickelson, you said that Jason shouldn't have any visitors for a while. Do you think that it would be okay if I took off for a couple days ? Lara, you're not thinking of going seeing Grady, are you ? Maybe Grady knows what Jason can't remember. Now, listen to me. This thing he's repressing, it has to be pretty bad. I mean, he severed ties with his family for a reason. I don't think it's wise that you get involved like that at this point. Yeah, I appreciate your concern, Dr. Mickelson. I'll be in touch. ( man ) Is this the order for table five ? ( man ) Yeah. Thank you. Grady, got a minute ? I wanna talk to you about something. Uh, sure. Can it hold-- hold on a second ? No, that's fine, it can wait. Grab a seat. Did I do something wrong ? No, not at all, not at all. I'll just get right to the point. How would you like to be the assistant manager here ? Me ? Well, sure. Harold and I talked about it over the weekend. We both think you'd be great. As assistant manager ? You've been our best employee for a long time. You're nice to the customers, you're never late. Anytime there's a complaint, you get right on it. Plus, you'd get $6 more an hour than you're making now and get full benefits after three months. I don't know how to be manager. You have to make schedules and do payroll and stuff. I'd train you. It's not hard. It won't be much of a stretch, Grady. I mean, how long you been here ? Eight years ? You could run this place in your sleep. Can I think about it ? Well, sure. I don't see what there is to think about, though. I just wanna talk it over with my brother. Okay. Let me know what you decide, all right ? I will. Definitely. ( Jason ) Look, whatever happened when I was a kid happened, okay ? I can't change that. Going away for a month of therapy isn't gonna make a difference, especially when I can't figure this out myself, okay ? I can't keep doing this, Lara. I can't-- I can't live like this. I don't know, though. What if I screw up the schedule or... forget to order the dough or something ? I don't know. ( man ) You don't give yourself enough credit, Grady. Come on. Candy's waiting for us. Let me drive. All right. Move over. She's probably worried that we're already late. ( bells jingling ) Hey. How's your inventory going ? It's driving me nuts. I wanted to make sure I returned it to you before Richard gets back next week. Oh, I doubt he'd even notice. So did you like it ? You have great taste in literature. Do you have time to help me study again ? Of course. Okay, let's see. Today's lesson... amortization. Fun, fun. Come on. We'll tackle it together. ( bells jingling ) Hey, Candy. I was trying to get something to eat, but I'm-- I'm a couple bucks short, and I was wondering if-- Jake. I told you last time. If you borrow, you have to pay it back. I haven't paid you back for-- Right. Okay. Well, I'll get that to you, okay ? Could I use the bathroom ? You're so beautiful, by the way. Don't ever change. Uh, who was that ? That's just Jake. He's been hanging around here forever. I lend him money sometimes. Hey, why don't you take your book and head to the office ? I'll lock up when he leaves. Okay. ( urinating ) Look, bro, I gotta ask you to stop coming around here, asking my friend for money. I don't see how that's any of your business, man. I just made it my business. So do we have an understanding ? What ? Look, man, I can do what I want, okay ? It's a free country. Just get out, now. You wanna do something, do something. ( man ) Let me handle this. Fine. You do it. Wait. Let me take off my glasses first. Who are you talking to, you psycho ? Do something ! ( grunting ) Nothing would make me happier than to end your life right now. Is that what you want ? Huh ? No ! ( grunting ) 'Cause I'll do it and I'll enjoy it. Joseph asked you to leave. Okay ! ( groaning ) ( bells jingling ) ( neck cracking ) Oh, my... glasses. ( Grady ) You're gonna pay me back $10 a month for five months. Now, that's amortization. I understand that part. It's the assets vs. the liability that keeps confusing me. Maybe I should just scrap this whole idea of becoming a real-estate agent. Don't say that, Candy. You can do this, I know you can. And you know what ? The day you get your license, I'm gonna treat you and your son to the best lobster-steak dinner you've ever had. You're such an optimist, Grady. Not always. But with you, I am. What if I pass that real-estate test and no one wants to give me a job ? Then I'll have wasted all my time and money. That's not gonna happen. Wanted me to give this to you. To thank you for those pizzas you brought by the other night. Wow, well, that is very cute. He should work for Hallmark. Tell Cody that I love this card. I will. ( knocking ) Lara ? What are you doing here ? Where's Jason ? Jason's... in the hospital. Can I talk to you inside ? Yeah, of course. But he's all right now ? He's in the hospital ? Well, they transferred him from the hospital to a mental-health facility. Why ? I mean, if he's all right, why does he have to go there ? Because his psychiatrist thinks that he might try to do it again. Should I go see him ? No, he can't have any visitors for a while, including me. Oh. Well, thank you for coming out here and telling me all this. Listen, Grady, that's not the only reason why I came. The place where Jason's staying, it's very expensive. It's okay. You don't have to say anything else. Here. It's my secret savings. I want you to have it for Jason. That's very sweet of you, Grady. Sometimes people leave tips at the restaurant. Unfortunately, I think that Jason's treatment's gonna be a little bit more than this. Oh. How are you gonna pay for it ? Well, I was hoping that-- that we could take out a new mortgage on this place, you know, since it belongs to both you and Jason. A new mortgage ? Well, basically, we would ask the bank for a new loan and use this house as collateral, and I would pay for everything. You wouldn't have to do anything. All you'd have to do is go to the bank with me to borrow and sign some loan papers. Uh... could I sleep on it ? Yeah, sure. We'll go to the bank tomorrow, we can't do anything tonight. Right. Do you want more coffee ? Oh, sure. I guess you have to stay here in town tonight ? Yeah, looks like it. Where ? Where are you gonna sleep ? Oh, I don't know. I saw a bunch of motels off the interstate. Maybe you should stay here. The place is huge. It is beautiful. My grandfather rebuilt it in the 1920s and gave it to my dad. He didn't change anything and neither have I. Are you sure it's okay if I stay here ? I wouldn't wanna impose. I think so. I mean... why not ? Nobody lives here but me. Nobody lives here but me. That's my dad's. Aren't you sick of pizza by now ? Don't you work at a pizza place ? That's all I know how to make. I can relate. Jason always makes fun of me because I don't know how to cook. It's not my fault, though. I grew up on Chef Boyardee and mac and cheese. I can do that. Okay. That's a pretty fancy hunting knife. Did your dad go hunting a lot ? Every Sunday. You two ever go with him ? Sometimes. Jason hates hunting. Surprised he ever went at all. He wanted to stop going, but dad wouldn't let him. I just keep that knife there because Dad talks about going again someday. He probably won't. His mind's not good. But they keep good care of him down at Sunset Oaks. You know, the home for old people ? You go and visit him a lot ? Work keeps me pretty busy. Especially at lunchtime. Jason never talks about your dad. All he ever says is that he couldn't stand him and that's why he left the day he turned 18. But you must have gotten along with him, right ? 'Cause you stayed. Jason likes olives on his pizza, I just remembered that. Do you like olives ? I think I have a can in the back pantry. Equity is what you sell your house for ? No, equity is the amount of money that you've already paid into your house. So basically, you're borrowing your own money. But you have to pay it back ? Yes, with interest. And I have to sign for it. Yes, you sign and then I'll sign on Jason's behalf. I'm sorry, can you excuse me ? Sure. ( water running ) I can't do this. I don't understand what she's talking about. You do it, Joseph. You talk to her. She's explaining it to you. Just listen to her. I don't understand about mortgages and loans and stuff. I don't get what she's saying. Okay, okay, calm down. I have a book in the den that explains real estate. No, I don't want a book. I want you to talk to her. Just decide if it's a good idea or not, okay ? ( knocking ) Grady ? Joseph, come out now. Are you okay ? Yeah, I'm fine. Sorry. All the stuff with Jason's a little overwhelming. I just don't have a lot of time. If I want him to stay at the facility, then I have to make a payment by next week and if we don't get approved for the loan, then-- Don't worry. We're gonna get approved. There's no reason why they won't give us an equity line of credit with a fixed interest rate of less than 5%. If it's more, then we'll talk to them about a variable, but in the long-term, that usually ends up costing you more. Don't worry. I'll make sure you don't get screwed. Come on, let's finish dinner. Yeah. Okay. I would put you in Jason's room, but it got turned into a den, so you can stay in here. Okay. Whose room is this ? It's Kara Lynn's. Kara Lynn ? Our sister. You have a sister ? Well, she passed away a while back. Oh, it's hot in here. Let me get this window for you. Oh, good, Boris fixed it. Who's Boris ? Oh, he's just a kid, helps me around the house. I would have said something earlier, but he's gone for a few months, anyway, so... Was Kara Lynn younger or older than you ? Uh, younger. You know what ? I'm really exhausted. I think I'm gonna hit the sack. Do you need anything else ? No, I'm fine. Thanks for letting me stay here. Well, good night. ( Grady ) Jason tried to kill himself. ( Joseph ) Lara needs our help paying for his treatment. ( man ) How could you let her sleep in Kara Lynn's room ? Let's not fight, guys. I like Jason. I don't want him to die. And you. Inviting her to stay at all. Am I the only one with a brain here ? ( Joseph ) This house is huge. He couldn't make her go to a hotel. You want her to figure it out, don't you ? Boris... what do you think ? Is it okay if she stays here ? Great. The mute approves ! ( clapping ) ( Grady ) Can we just finish going around the room so I know what happened today ? I'll let you know what you did today. You betrayed Dad's trust by inviting Jason's little bitch to stay here. "Kara Lynn Darcie was fishing with her father "when she fell off the pier and drowned, according to Detective Theodore Snyder." ( Joseph ) By the way, that little stunt you pulled with the guy in the washroom this afternoon, it was completely out of control. And if it happens again, you're not coming out anymore. You think you have a choice ? No, I don't. But he does. I was doing you a favor. You wanted my help ! Please stop. ( Lara ) "The girl, who could not swim, was pronounced dead at the scene." ( Lara ) Grady ? Grady ? Joseph, she's coming. She's coming ! Hey, good morning. Oh, good morning. There you go. Nothing relieves stress like a high-calorie breakfast with no nutritional value whatsoever. So I'm working today, but I'll be done at 3:00 and I'll meet you at the bank. Sound like a plan ? Yeah. Are you sure you're okay with this loan ? 'Cause last night I got the impression that you were kind of new at all this financial stuff. I don't know what was wrong with me last night. I guess you kind of caught me off guard, I suppose. But it's fine, we'll do the loan. We don't need to discuss it any more. Thank you, Grady. It means a lot to me. There's something else I wanted to talk to you about. Jason... wrote a suicide note. It's really short, but... it didn't make a lot of sense to me. "I'm sorry, Lara. "Please forgive me. "It's like certain memories have been covered in black, and although... ( Jason ) I can't see through the pain, I know they're there and they never go away. I'm sure this leaves more questions than answers. The pain and the guilt get worse by the day. Not knowing what's festering under the black is killing me but I think knowing the truth might be even worse. "Please know that you are the best thing "that ever happened to me. Love, Jason." I don't know what he feels so guilty about. But I was thinking it might have something to do with-- with this. You went through her stuff ? No, I-- I found it in a box in her closet. I thought that maybe Jason's note, it might have something to do with Kara Lynn. No, no ! Grady ? I'm sorry. I-- I-- I have to go. I'm so sorry ! ( man ) I told you. I told you not to let that snoopy bitch stay here. Let me take care of her. Okay. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. She knows too much. No... William, I can handle this. It's fine. She's not gonna be a problem. ( breathing heavily ) ( engine revving ) ( Jason ) Look, it doesn't matter how much I try, okay ? I just can't remember very much. It's just a few images here and there, that's it. I-- Like what ? What do you remember ? Mostly bad stuff, you know ? About my father. He was pretty crazy. What images come to mind ? Shoot it. You missed, you idiot. There was this one time... when he locked me and Grady in the cellar. ( whimpering ) ( door slamming ) Yes, then what ? I don't know. Memory just ends. My sister wasn't there. Must have been after she died. Your sister ? ( sighing ) Yeah. Kara Lynn. She was the youngest. This is the first time you've ever mentioned her to me. It is so hard to remember anything. You know, and every time I start to, I... I don't know, I get this-- there's this horrible feeling that comes over me and I just-- it stops everything. There's nothing. ( sighing ) You know, it feels like my whole-- my whole childhood is just like this one disjointed dream. Do you remember anything about your sister's death ? Where's your sister ? She hasn't finished her chores. I'll give you three seconds. ( Dr. Mickelson ) Jason ? I can't. I'm sorry, I... I'm sorry, I can't. What did you remember just then ? Look, Doc, I'm just, uh... I'm just really, really tired, you know ? Can I just go back to my room ? I just wanna watch a little TV and just-- Well, our time's almost up, anyhow. Listen, would it be okay if I call Lara ? Y'know, I asked earlier and they said that I couldn't. I just-- I'd prefer you waited until the weekend. Jason. I think we're very close to a breakthrough. ( door creaking ) Great. Creepy man. June Shaeffer. Yeah, hi, umm, residential listing ? ( woman ) For what city ? In Coville ? And what name ? June Shaeffer. One moment, please. ( phone ringing ) ( woman ) Hi, you've reached June Shaeffer. I can't take your call right now. Please leave me a message. If it's urgent, call Xanadu Coffee Shop, 555-3149. Thanks. ( woman ) Grady, hey. So did you think about what we talked about ? About the promotion ? Of course. What do you say ? I'm sorry. I can't take it. Why not ? I have a lot of things on my mind right now. My brother tried to kill himself. Oh, Grady, I'm so sorry. Is he gonna be okay ? Yeah, Lara thinks he will be. That's his wife. Listen, if you need any time off-- I just... need more spoons. Thanks for your concern about my brother. Why are you running your mouth off like that ? We don't talk about our family to anyone, remember ? I know, but Maria-- I don't care. Keep your mouth shut ! I don't even know why we're still here right now. We should be at home keeping our eye on that snoopy little bitch. You said you weren't gonna come out unless I said you could. If it wasn't for me, you'd be dead by now or in some mental hospital like your brother. Do you understand me ? Do you understand me, Grady ? I have to work. Yes... by all means. Your work is so important. Go make some pizza. ( Dr. Mickelson ) He did mention a sister today. Kara Lynn ? You know about her. Yeah, I just found out about her. I tried to talk to Grady about it, but it really upset him. Listen, there's someone else I can talk to. I found out he has an aunt who lives here. I'm gonna meet up with her right now. I'll let you know what I find out, okay ? Okay. All right, bye. ( William ) Go home and check on her. I have a bad feeling about this one. Go home and check on her. Would you stop talking to me ? I'm working. Go home. Go home. Go home ! Go home, go home, go home, go home ! Fine ! This is us. Oh, he looks just like my sister. Same eyes and chin. I don't see it as much in Grady. Grady looks more like his dad. So did Kara Lynn. How did your sister meet Paul ? Oh, poor Elizabeth. I mean, she was young, you know ? They met at a fair, just before Paul was about to be shipped off on his tour. None of us liked him at all. I told her to steer clear of him. Why ? Because he was just downright mean. He was controlling and selfish. And then she got pregnant with Jason, so they got married. And as soon as she was his wife, he wouldn't let her do athing. ( man ) Hey, June. Just a minute. Honey, you know, I'm sorry, there's just-- one of the girls called in sick today, and I've gotta handle everything myself. Just hang on one second. Is there sugar ? Never mind, I see it. Good, great. Want more coffee ? Sure. When exactly did Elizabeth pass away ? It was about three months after Kara Lynn drowned. What happened ? Elizabeth was miserable. Kara Lynn was her favorite. Jason found her. She... shot herself with one of Paul's handguns. Jason had nightmares for a long time after that. Do you know how sick Paul is ? He kept the gun that she had used. Jason wouldn't go around guns after that. I mean, those poor children. They lost their mom and their sister. What happened the day that Kara Lynn drowned ? Do you mean, was it really an accident ? I always thought there was more to it than that. But I wasn't the only one. The detective on the case, he had his suspicions, also. Suspicions, why ? Well, it just goes back to the way Paul was with his kids, you know ? ( man ) June, can we get a refill ? I'll just be one sec. You know, honey, this isn't the place to talk. I'm gonna call you tonight, okay ? And I will tell you all kinds of stuff that that crazy, mean Paul did. Yeah, okay. It's on the house. You're not going to see Candy, Joseph. The whole point of leaving was to figure out what Lara's up to. You're paranoid, William. Once this bank thing's done, she'll go back to Philadelphia. She's dangerous. If that's not the pot calling the kettle black. I agree with Joseph. I like Lara. It's nice to have someone to eat dinner with. She doesn't cut the tomatoes right, but-- Shut up ! We're going home. Whether you like it or not. ( Joseph ) William, let Grady talk to her. ( William ) No ! ( Grady ) I didn't say you could come out, William. Too bad. Lara ! Lara. ( William ) Grady, force him to go back inside. I don't need you, William. I can handle this. ( June ) Do you mean, was it really an accident ? I always thought there was more to it than that. I mean, those poor children. They lost their mom and their sister. ( Grady ) Please, William. Why do we care if she talks to Aunt June ? I need to talk to you. It's important. ( June ) He was just downright mean. He was controlling and selfish. And as soon as she was his wife, he wouldn't let her do anything. Where was she going after she left ? I really don't know. I think she went to see your father. I mean, what difference does it make ? And you answered her questions. Grady, she's Jason's wife. She's just trying to find out why he tried to kill himself. I'm sure you had all kinds of nice things to say about Dad, too. I have a right to my opinion, and I'm gonna share them with whoever I like. You're sounding a lot like your father right now. I don't care about your batty old opinion. You had no right to talk to her about what happened to Kara Lynn ! Just wait a second now. I just told her what Paul had told me. Is there something that I don't know about here ? Grady... what happened to your sister ? He did something, didn't he ? No. He has made you lie for him, hasn't he ? No. There wasn't a real accident. You need to shut up. I know in my heart that Paul killed that little girl. I told Lara that, too. He has gotten away with it after all these years, hasn't he ? You can't tell anyone what happened. Kara Lynn was always making Dad mad. She never listened ! So he did do it, didn't he ? Shut the hell up ! No, I'm not gonna shut up ! I'm gonna tell everyone what that bastard did to that little girl. Oh, no you're not. Oh, yes, yes, I am. Your father is a monster ! ( screaming ) ( woman ) Mr. Darcie has his good days and his bad days. I suppose we all do, right ? You know, when you first wrote "daughter-in-law," I was kind of shocked. I forgot that Mr. Darcie had an older son. It's William, right ? No, his name is Jason. Oh... 'kay. Sometimes Mr. Darcie talks about a William as if that were his son. People with his condition often confuse things, though. You must live a ways away. Your husband never comes to visit. Well, I've heard that Mr. Darcie isn't exactly the fatherly type. That's for sure. Grady's told you some things about his dad ? Oh, well, no, I just meant that Mr. Darcie can be a little overwhelming at times. I've never actually had a conversation with Grady unless you count the notes. The notes ? On his notepad. I'm sorry, what are you talking about ? Grady. He only writes short phrases on a notepad. He's mute. Didn't you know that ? Mr. Darcie ? I'm Lara. Lara Darcie. I'm married to your son, Jason. Jason's... had a rough couple of months. I was hoping that I could ask you some questions. Do you understand what I'm saying, Mr. Darcie ? Elizabeth ? Elizabeth ? Do you mean your wife ? No, I'm-- I'm Lara. I'm your daughter-in-law. Elizabeth died several years ago. I'd like to ask you about Kara Lynn. Do you remember your daughter, Kara Lynn ? I've... seen this blanket before. I... Mr. Darcie, I need you to think about Kara Lynn. She drowned in the lake behind your house. Do you remember that ? What about the funeral ? Do you remember that ? Who are you ? I'm Lara. I'm your daughter-in-law. I'd like to ask you some questions about Kara Lynn. No. Who are you, really ? Who sent you ? No one. No one sent me, sir. That... bloody detective sent you, didn't he ? No, no, no one sent me. Sir. Jason, he's tried to kill himself. Good. That... selfish punk, deserting a family that way. What ? I hope he puts a gun in his mouth and pulls the trigger. Like his mother. The coward's way out. Wow. June was right about you. ( William ) Damn it. He's telling her stuff. ( Joseph ) Whatever he's saying, it probably doesn't even make sense anyway. ( Grady ) I wish Boris was here. He's the one who deals with Dad. He can't talk to Boris, idiot. Boris can't talk. If Dad was even capable of saying something about it, he would have told a nurse or someone by now. And trust me, we'd know. ( sirens blaring ) You-- you liar ! Where are they ? Where are they ? It's okay, it's okay. She told them where I am. You should go. Sudden noises set him off. Mr. Darcie ? ( Joseph ) She's going to the bank. Think I better handle this ? Yeah, you should. The quicker she's gone, the better. Wonder how much longer he's gonna be. Well, I'm not in a hurry. Are you ? No. So... what'd you do today ? This town has so much to offer. Just-- just drove around a bit. Caught up on some reading at a coffee shop. Really, which one ? Just this one in the mall. I can't remember the name. Oh. What book are you reading ? Sorry about that, guys. Did you get everything signed ? Yep. So when can we expect the check ? I should have it by Friday morning. So the day after tomorrow. Yes. Oh, that's great. Y'know, the quicker, the better. No problem, glad I could help you. Thank you. Oh, yes, thanks very much. No problem. ( bells jingling ) What's up, Candy ? Here's 20 out of what I owe you. I'll get the rest to you later. Can I use the bathroom ? Sure. Uh, that crazy guy isn't here, is he ? Who are you talking about ? Okay. ( William ) Let me in ! ( Joseph ) Keep him out. We need to keep William away from Lara. I say we ask Candy if we can spend the night in the store. Aunt June had a little accident today. She fell down some stairs and she's dead. I'd say it was partially my fault. But she's the only aunt we have left. You murdered Aunt June ? You're a bastard. Why would you kill her ? I said it was an accident. Sort of. Jake ? What did you mean, earlier ? You know, when you said that guy was crazy ? I don't even wanna talk about it. Honestly. See you. Well, Jake ! ( cell phone ringing ) Hello ? Hey, Lara, it's me. Listen, I don't have much time. I just wanted to call and hear your voice. Jason, where are you calling from ? Are you okay ? Yeah, I'm fine. I... I borrowed a phone here. I just... I don't know. I just wanted to hear your voice. Where are you ? I called the house. I-- I just-- I just went out for a walk. I miss you. I can't wait to see you. Listen, I can't stay. I love you. I love you, too. Okay, bye. ( Candy ) How's the book ? I can't read. I can't do anything. Grady, you've been acting strange since you got here. What's wrong ? Uh... my aunt died. Oh, Grady, I'm so sorry. Can I ask you a favor ? Sure. Can I stay here tonight ? I mean, sleep on the sofa. I don't think it's a good idea for me to go home tonight. Grady, I don't think I can let you do that. You're welcome to spend the night at my place, though. No ! No. I mean... I just wanna stay here. Alone. All right. I guess I could let you do that. Thank you. Thank you. ( crow cawing ) ( Lara ) Grady ? Grady ? Where are you ? "Grady, I'm so sorry about your aunt. "If you need anything at all, please call me. Candy." ( June ) Hi, you've reached June Shaeffer. I can't take your call right now. Please leave me a message. If it's urgent, call Xanadu Coffee Shop. Thanks. Hi, June, it's Lara. I didn't hear back from you the other night so I thought I'd give you a call. Well, if you get a sec, just give me a call. I'll talk to you later. ( horn honking ) Give me a call when you can. Okay, thanks. Bye. ( bells jingling ) Oh, I'm sorry, we're not open yet. Oh, I'm looking for Grady. Oh, it's his day off. I'm the manager. Is there anything I can help you with ? Uh... I'm Lara. Oh, hi. He mentioned you. You're married to his brother. Yeah, that's right. He told me what happened. I hope your husband's okay. Thanks. He's getting better. Listen, I'm staying with Grady, and I don't think he came home last night. Grady didn't come home ? Yeah, and he specifically said that he would be there. I know he left work early yesterday. Said he had a headache. I wasn't here, but he left me a note. Grady wrote that ? Yeah. Why ? I don't think that he wrote that. I saw him sign his name 100 times on all these loan papers yesterday and his signature looks nothing like that. Grady's worked here for almost eight years. It's always looked like that. ( William ) Where are we going ? I don't know. I don't know where I'm going. I'm just driving, William. Stop asking me what I'm doing. ( Lara ) I appreciate your time. When the lady at the police station said that your dad had passed away, I wasn't sure if I should call. That was Millie. She and my dad were good friends. Yeah, I remember this case. Kara Lynn's aunt said that your dad thought that maybe Mr. Darcie was involved in some way. He was pretty upset when they ruled it an accident. Couldn't prove it was the dad, though. I mean, all he had was a theory that no one seemed to care about. Theory, what theory ? My dad was really into fishing. He loved going out to that lake. I guess Mr. Darcie fished out there a lot, too. Yeah, the lake wasn't far from their house. According to my father, the bluegill don't bite when it's too hot. I looked that up, it's actually true. Anyway, it was over 90° that day. My dad said he would have known that they weren't gonna catch anything. So if they weren't out there to fish, then-- The thing was, Mr. Darcie said he pulled her from the lake. My dad found out Mr. Darcie didn't know how to swim. Neither did the little girl. The only two in that family who knew how to swim were the brothers. Thanks a lot. Dad said neither of the boys would talk after it happened. Either too traumatized or afraid to tell anyone the truth. What are you saying ? That-- that Mr. Darcie could have forced Jason and Grady to-- to cover up the murder of their sister ? That's as much as I know. I wish my father were still here. He could tell you a lot more. No, thank you. You've been very helpful. ( cell phone ringing ) June, hi. ( man ) This isn't June. It's her neighbor. I saw you called. I'm really sorry to tell you this, but June's passed away. What ? Yeah, apparently, she fell down the stairs sometime yesterday. Oh, my God. ( Joseph ) This has gotta end. Look what it's doing to Grady. You're supposed to be helping him. I am helping him. He wouldn't be like that if Lara wasn't here. Stop blaming everyone else for the stuff that you start. It ends today, William. I'm done with it. I'm sick of you trying to turn Grady against me. Maybe you were important in the past. He created me first, Not anymore. Now he needs me. You killed our aunt. I told you, that was an accident. Nothing's an accident with you. You're the only one of us that's completely out of control. You think I'm out of control ? I just want you to understand that I'm in complete control. I've had about as much of you as I can take. ( Officer Snyder ) Couldn't prove that it was the dad, though. I mean, all he had was a theory that no one seemed to care about. ( door creaking ) Why would you do that ? Why'd you create me, Grady ? Why ? To protect me... from Dad. I just protected you. From yourself. From now on, I'm in charge. If you ever... ever cross me, I'll do the same thing to you. You understand me, Grady ? Yes. Yes, I understand. Good. Because now I can do what I wanted all along. Take care of Lara. William. Joseph. Boris. Oh, my God. ( Dr. Mickelson ) Hello ? ( Lara ) Well, I'm not sure if I can prove it, but I'm pretty sure I know what happened. What ? I'm pretty sure that Mr. Darcie killed Kara Lynn and may have forced Jason and Grady to help him. That'd explain why he's blocked the incident from his memory. Yeah, and I think it caused some sort of break in Grady. What do you mean ? Different handwritings, sometimes he knows a lot about something and other times, he acts like he's never even heard about it. I mean, the guy reads at a fifth-grade level and yet he's got "War and Peace" bookmarked. It's like he's totally different people. That sounds like Dissociative Identity Disorder, but it's very rare. Does he ever have moments where he forgot what happened ? Yeah, and then there are all these strange little drawings. ( doorbell ringing ) Dr. Mickelson, I have to go. There's someone at the door. Hi. Hi. Is Grady here ? No, he's not. Who are you ? I'm Lara, I'm his sister-in-law. I'm Candy, his friend. Anyway, he forgot these glasses when he left this morning. You saw Grady this morning ? Come on in, I've been worried sick about him. Well, I'm still really concerned about him. He's just not the type to leave stuff. And... he was acting really strange when I left last night. Strange, how ? Just agitated. I mean, I figured it was 'cause his aunt died, but-- How did you know that, about his aunt ? Grady told me. How did he know ? I don't know. I mean, he just knew... somehow. Come into the kitchen with me. There's something I wanna show you. Has Grady ever mentioned any of these people to you before ? Just this one. His brother, William. His brother's name is Jason. Well, then who's William ? William... is Grady. ( Dr. Mickelson ) Jason, is it possible that you and your brother witnessed your father killing Kara Lynn ? We are never going to tell anyone what really happened. Do you understand ? Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I-- I don't know. I don't know, everything's so fragmented, you know. It's all out of order, I just-- I don't know. I talked to Lara. She thinks your brother may have an identity disorder. Which one of you did this ? It was you, wasn't it, Kara Lynn ? You're gonna be sorry. And so are you boys. You should have told me what she'd done. I did it. Damn it, Grady. Grady's not here. It's William. Tell me she's not there with him. Tell me my wife is not in Coville with my brother. She is. Damn it, no ! I don't understand, what are you saying ? That Grady is all of these people ? I think what happens is that he switches back and forth. He does these things that are completely out of character. You might be right. Jake was implying that Grady had beat him up. What ? Who's Jake ? Just this guy at my work. When he told me that, I just assumed he was lying about Grady. Grady's told you some things about William ? Candy, what ? Well, there was this one thing, but he told me in confidence. Look, Candy, if Grady's told you some stuff, then we need to help him. Well, I remember thinking it was strange at the time, but he came over to the bookstore where I work one night, after everyone was gone, and we started talking about how suddenly, some certain things can suddenly change your life forever. So how old was this little girl ? Seven. He didn't mean for it to happen. It was an accident. My friend's father was really-- well, he was a lot like mine. And this guy had a sister who was always getting him into trouble. One day, she went out to the lake-- she wanted to play in their dad's boat instead of doing her chores. My friend said that she should go back home. He knew that their dad would go psycho on all of them if she didn't. But he ended up in the boat with her, and sure enough, their dad came looking for her. And then what happened ? William got so angry, he rode the boat under the pier to hide them from their dad and... he put his hand... over his sister's mouth so that she would stay quiet. Their dad passed, didn't see them. William waited for him to go back into the woods and he let go of his sister's mouth. But by that time... she wasn't moving. She was just limp. He suffocated her ? He didn't know. I mean, he was so young and he just panicked and... when he jumped out of the boat, his sister's body fell into the water and he just swam to shore and left her there. If Grady does have multiple personalities, then William was the one who was on the boat with Kara Lynn. It must have been killing Grady to keep this inside. Y'know, I should have been there to protect him. Both Kara Lynn and him. You know, I was the oldest. Grady needed me. First chance I got, I left Grady... to deal with Dad all by himself. I should have taken him with me. I should have gotten him the help that he needed. That's what I should've done and I didn't do that. I just left him. He never talked to you about any of this ? Never. And we've been married for over two years. I never even knew that he had a sister until I got here. I feel so bad for your husband. Yeah, it's been hard. Grady... what are you doing ? ( screaming ) Oh, my God ! Joseph says good-bye. ( locks clanking ) ( screaming ) Don't make me angry, Lara. You saw what happens when I'm upset. Now open the door. Open the door ! ( banging ) Open the door ! Lara ? Are you in there ? Grady ? Was William here ? Oh, my God, what's going on ? Grady ? Please, open the door. I'm afraid William's gonna come back and I don't know what to do. I need somebody to help me. I have to do something. There's a phone here. Should I call 9-1-1 ? Yes, call 9-1-1 ! Yes... please hurry. I need an ambulance at 297 Canal Street. Please. Lara, you need to talk to them. She wants to know what happened. ( cell phone ringing ) Damn it ! Jason ? Grady ? Where's Lara ? Lara's busy right now. I'm talking to William, aren't I ? Good guess, big brother. Please... don't hurt her. Please, for me. And why should I do anything for you ? What did you ever do for me ? Just listen to me. I know that I failed you big time, all right ? I left you alone with Dad, and I shouldn't have done that. I know that. What are you talking about ? I turned out so well. Please. I'm sorry. It's too late, Jason. All right, you listen to me. If anything happens to Lara, you will go away to prison for the rest of your life. I will make sure of that. After what you did to me, you don't deserve to have anything ! You left Grady when he needed you most. So I had to take care of him. You weren't there when I had to keep Kara Lynn quiet. You weren't there. And you're not here now. But your wife is. ( door creaking ) I'm sorry, Jason. I have to hang up now. Wait ! Lara, Lara ! Grady, please... just put the knife down. I don't wanna hurt you. Look, I know that you were just trying to hide your sister from your dad when she drowned. You don't know anything about any of that. Yes, I do. And I can help you ! I don't want your help. I like me just the way I am. I protect Grady. And if people have to die like Kara Lynn or Aunt June, well, then, those people just have to die ! ( gunshot firing ) ( panting ) ( woman ) 9-1-1, what's your emergency ? I need an ambulance. Where are you ? Canal Street. Where on Canal Street ? The Darcie house. Okay, let me look it up. Found it. They're on their way. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything. All right, listen, honey. You better waddle a little bit faster or they're gonna give away our reservation. Don't rush me. It's a shame I'll only get this attention for two more months. Ooh. Maybe I'll have to get pregnant again. I could say something a little inappropriate about that, but I won't. It's never held you back before. Well, darling, baby, I'm not gonna do that. ( cell phone ringing ) Oh, I think that might be Candy. Yeah. Hey, you. Hope you've got some good news for us. ( Candy ) I sure do. It's a done deal. Yes ! Sold the house. Hey, Candy, that's great. Listen, you better just send us the check, okay ? I don't think we'll be visiting Coville anytime soon. I didn't think so. I'll fax you the paperwork. Bye for now. Okay, talk to you later. Bye-bye. That's great. All right, you all set ? Are you kidding, I'm starved. Yeah. There's no way we can change that reservation, is there ? What, you don't feel like steak ? I feel a little bit more like Pad Thai. Pad Thai-- we had that yesterday. I know, but the baby likes it. The baby likes it. Well, then, in that case. Whatever the baby wants. The baby gets. Exactly.
