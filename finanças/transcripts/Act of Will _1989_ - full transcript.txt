(whimsical music) (horns blowing) - Hi, Joe, how are you doing? - [Joe] Pretty good, thanks, and yourself? - Hmm, about time too. - [Kyle] Grand! - Kyle. - [Kyle] Oh, oh, it's lovely to see you again. - [Audra] Hmm. - What're you doing in America? - Well, your mother thought I might be able to talk to you. - There's nothing to talk about. Even you won't make me change my mind. - Do you see what we're dealing with? - She seems to have forgotten that I'm grown up now. - Then why behave like a child? - I'm quite capable of deciding what I want to do with my life. I don't need all this. I don't care if I starve in a garret so long as I can paint. - Stop being so dramatic. - You don't care if I'm happy. All you want is for me to just follow in your footsteps. - Look, it's because I care that I'm trying to stop you throwing your life away. I've spent the last 25 years building up The House of Christina and you-- - Don't you understand I don't want to design clothes, and sit behind some desk and deal with imbecilic models. - But it's always been understood that you're-- - Oh, understood by you perhaps. - Oh, and then you just throw away your course at The Fashion Institute. - Do you think it was easy for me? I tried to stick it out, Grand, really I did. But what's the point When all I want is to be an artist? Grand, you know how happy I was with you last summer. Painting away all day. - Well, she can still paint as a hobby, but she can also go into the business. - Always business, well, as far as I'm concerned, your business can go to hell! - Kyle, come back here! - She didn't mean it, she's overwrought. - Oh, Mom, you know The House of Christina means more to me than just a business. If Kyle walks away, then what's it all been for? - Ah, Christy, you can't plan your child's life for her. - I know, but I can't stand by and let her ruin it. - Oh, don't worry. We'll work it out somehow. - What would I do without you, Mom? - You'd cope like I did when I lost my mother and everything else. It's all a matter of will. (melancholy music) (bell tolling) - But spare us, Lord most holy, O God, most mighty, O holy and merciful Savior, thou most worthy Judge eternal, suffer us not at our last hour. For any pains of death to fall from Thee. For as much it hath pleased O mighty God of His great mercy to take unto Himself the soul of our dear sister here departed. We therefore commit her body to the ground earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust in sure and certain hope of the Resurrection to eternal life, through our Lord, Jesus Christ, who shall change our vile body, that it may be likened to His glorious body according to the mighty working, whereby he is able even. - Now that the funeral is over, your Uncle Percival has something to tell you. - Yes (clears throat), well, I'm afraid this will come as a shock to you. Indeed it came as a shock to your aunt and me. The last thing we had anticipated, the very last. The fact is you won't be able to live here any longer. - Not live here? But it's our mother's-- - But we've always lived here. - High Cleugh is our home. - Not any more. In fact, as it now transpires, it never was. - It seems your father did not own the house as we had always supposed. He merely rented it from Peter Lacey, your mother's um, friend. When your father died, Mr. Lacey allowed your mother to stay on without paying anything for her lifetime. The property now reverts to his family. - The annuity he left also ceases with her death. - You mean we have nothing? - That I regret to say is the position. As it is, your aunt and I have agreed to provide a home for you with us. It is our duty as Christians. - Have you nothing to say? - Well, when do we have to leave? - Tomorrow, you can pack up your things tonight. - What will happen to Mother's things? - They will have to be auctioned to settle her debts. - Not Father's painting of High Cleugh. Please, Uncle Percival, you can't sell that. (melancholy music) - Audra, young ladies do not sit in the street. What're you doing out here? I told you to stay in your room. - I know, but the light was so perfect, I thought you wouldn't mind. - I told you mornings are for study. Come in at once and wash your hands and face. (children laughing and chattering) I don't know what freedoms you've been allowed in the past, but this is an ordered household. We keep to a strict timetable, and rules are made to be observed. (dramatic music) - Well, I suppose we'll get used to it. - Well, I shan't, ever. (door thuds) (melancholy music) - [Frederick] Those are Mother's. - Ah, be careful now. Those are valuable pieces. Ah, the chairs go in there along with the Sheraton tables. Ah, when you bring the chest in, it can stay here in the hall. - Those are Mother's things. - I am well aware of that fact. - But Uncle Percival told us that all her possessions are being auctioned. - All but these few items, which I shall store here until you and your brothers are old enough to have them. - She did say she was storing them for us. - She's not, is she? Everyday something appears in one of the rooms. - That's right, I saw Father's clock in the library this morning. - And Flossie told me she brought out our silver service when the vicar came. And she's got Mother's jewel case in her bedroom. - Only for safe keeping. That's what she told me. - Well, I don't believe her, and I think we should do something to protect our own interests. - An inventory? - Yes, listing everything you have of Mother's. We thought it would be sensible, didn't we, Frederick? - Yes, seeing as Mother never made a will. - Then the three of us can go through the items together and decide how we'd like to divide them up. - When we come of age. - I hardly think that's necessary. - We mentioned it to the vicar and he thought it was an excellent idea, and we knew you'd approve, Aunt Alicia, as your so keen on lists yourself. (laughing) We won! - Yeah (laughing)! - See, I told you it would be all right. - I wouldn't be so sure. There are bound to be repercussions. Did you see her face? - Over the past few months, we have considered the matter very carefully, and we have reached what we believe to be the best decision all around. What better place for two able-bodied young men than to carve out a life for themselves in the land of opportunity. I refer, of course, to Australia. - Australia? - Yes, dear, we've arranged for you to emigrate. - Emigrate? - Bit of a shock, I dare say, but you'll soon grow accustomed to the idea. - When are we going? - I think you misunderstand, Audra. You won't be going. We have other plans for you. We have found you employment at the Fever Hospital in Ripon. - No. - You can't split us up. We're not going anywhere without Audra. - (scoffs) I'm afraid you have no say in the matter, Frederick. - You will write, won't you? - As soon as we get to Sydney. - Send the letters to the Fever Hospital. I shan't ever come back here. - Take care of yourself then. - And you. Both of you. - Hurry now, your uncle is waiting. - [Audra] Wait! (dramatic orchestral music) - Come on now, boys, or you'll miss the train. (melancholy music) (birds chirping) - Look at Lady Mock. Who does she think she is? - It's a ward maid's duty to keep everything clean, and I mean clean. Floors scrubbed, woodwork washed, no shortcuts. It's also your job to make the beds, wash and iron the sheets, empty the bedpans, do up the lavatories, and to disinfect the surgical ward daily. Well, you might as well get started right away. Bathroom's through there, tub needs scouring. - Yes, Sister. (child coughing) - [Sister] Nurse, that boy shouldn't be out of bed. - [Nurse] Yes, Sister. (children laughing and chattering) - Well, don't stand there looking at it. - I'm sorry, Sister, but I'm not quite sure what to do. - Happen you're not used to such chores? - No, but I'll manage if you could just show me, please. - Well, you roll your sleeves up for a start. She won't last long. (whimsical music) Winnie Bews. Nothing for you. - [Frederick] We'll send for you as soon as we can afford to. It won't be long. (Audra crying) - Hey, Audra, you best pack that up. We're on duty in five minutes. (birds chirping) - Posts here! Lilian Craig. Nellie Bathurst. Nurse Entwistle, woo, posts come from Blackpool, very nice. Winnie Bews. Expecting something, were you, Audra? - From my brothers. - Oh, mine never write to me either, lazy beasts. - But they promised. Well, they just emigrated, you see, to Australia. - Do your parents live there too? - No, no, they're both dead. - Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, trust me to put my foot in it. - Freddie said they'd send for me as soon as they're settled. - Well, I'm sure you'll hear from them soon. (bell rings) (dramatic music) (Audra murmuring) (melancholy music) - Well, don't just stand there. Get back to work. That bedpan needs emptying. - Hello. - Oh, hello, Gwen. - Is that the letter you were waiting for? - Yes, at last. - Great, how are your brothers getting on down under? - Well, they're finding it a bit tough. They say it's not easy to find work. Well, they're both unskilled, you see. - Yeah, without training, you're nothing. - I shan't let that happen to me. I'm going to apply to train as a nurse like you. - But you're not old enough surely. - Why, I'm nearly 16. - Well, they do say the new matron's quite go ahead. She might make an exception. (both giggle) - Tell me, Audra, why are you so anxious to start training at once? - Because I want to do something with my life, and I can't afford to waste anymore time. - You consider your work as a ward maid as a waste of time? - Oh no, Matron. At the least, it's taught me a lot, but I feel I'm ready to move on now to make a career for myself. - Well, I'm all for young women being ambitious, but nursing, you know, is a vocation, not just a means to an end. Do you think you have such a vocation, Audra? - Yes, I do. I admit, I never thought of it before I came here, but then I never-- - Hadn't had to consider working at all. - Not for a living. I was hoping to be a painter, a landscape artist. - Hardly a secure job. - But since I've been here, seeing some of the work they do in the children's wards, I can't think of anything more worthwhile than healing a sick child. - Nor can I. You do realize it's a very tough training, both physically and mentally. Many students fall by the wayside. - I wouldn't. - I don't know how to thank you, Matron. - Oh, it's not me you have to thank, it's Nurse Kenton here. I don't think he'd have pulled through without her. - I wasn't the only one looking after him. - You were the one he responded to. - Thank you, Nurse. Oh, it's like a miracle. Say goodbye, Tommy. - (chuckles) Goodbye, Tom. Be a good boy now. - [Matron] Bye, Tom. - [Tommy] Bye! - [Boy] Bye, Tommy! - Bye! - I meant what I said. I believe you have a true gift for healing, Audra. Don't waste it, will you? - [Child] Nurse! - Well, coming from Matron, that's the height of praise. All I ever get is Thornton, don't run, or straighten your things. Oh, that reminds me. When are we going shopping-- - Nurse Thornton! Would you endeavor to control your girlish exuberance. I could hear you right down the passage. - Oh, Lord. - As much as you might like the sound of your voice, others may not share your enthusiasm, particularly when they are ill. - I'm sorry, Dr. Freemantle. (both giggling) He's always on at me. Well, I know if I were a lad, I'd sooner have you around than him. - Audra. - Well, the children all love you and they're scared of him. I don't know why someone like that becomes a doctor. - Well, it can't be for the money. They say his family's rolling in it. (birds chirping) Oh, I wish I could paint like that. - It's not right. I can't quite get the sky. Oh well, better pack up I suppose. - Nurse Thornton, Matron wants to see you in the office at once. - Oh, what have I done now? - Gwen, what did she want? What's wrong? - (sighs) It's my mom, she's poorly again, her heart. - Oh, I'm sorry. - Dad wants me to apply for a position at one of the hospitals in Leeds so I'll be nearer home. - How long do you think you'll be away? - Well, that's the worst part. I don't know how to tell you this. I shan't be coming back at all. Don't look like that, Audra. I'll only be a couple of hours away. Well, you can come for weekends, and you're coming for Christmas again. We'll still be friends. (gasps) Oh, Audra, look at that bracelet. It almost looks real. Why don't you buy it? - Come on, Gwen. - You've bought nothing yet. - Well, if I do, it won't be anything like that. It'll have to be something practical. - Hmm, oh, it's so dull being practical. I love squandering. - So I've noticed. But I've got nothing to squander. Oh, look. - Why don't you try it on? - It's three guineas, Gwen. I've only got two pounds 12. - I'll lend you the rest. - No. - Oh, go on. (rain pattering) (lively jazz music) - [Man] Whoops. (lively jazz music) - [Gwen] Oh (giggles). - (chuckles) Thank you. (audience applauding) - Gwen, shall we have this dance? - You'll have to kiss me. - Not here. - Oh, go on. (Mike laughing) You beast. - Will you have this one too? - No, thanks, Charlie. I think I'll sit out for a bit. My shoes are pinching. - I'll sit with you. - No, why don't you ask someone else to dance. There must be heaps of girls you know here, go on. - No one could accuse you of encouraging me. (light jazz music) (man laughing loudly) (light jazz music) - Excuse me, miss. Would you like to dance? - No thanks. - (giggles) Oh, come on, Audra. Why aren't you dancing? - I'd sooner watch. (light jazz music) - Change your mind, Audra? - No, thanks, Charlie. - Well, I'll be back for the last Waltz. (light jazz music) (audience applauding) - Do you want an orange? - Yes, please. - Drink, Audra? - I'll have a lemonade, thanks. (lively jazz music) - So, you approve of Mike then? - He's smashing, just right for you, Gwen. - We'll probably get engaged in the summer. Oh, but we won't be able to get married till Mike's qualified. Oh, you know my secret dream? For you and Charlie to get married at the same time. Oh, then we'll be sisters-in-law, and Mike and Charlie could set up practice together, and we could live close, and our children could play together. - Gwen you are such a silly. I'm not gonna marry anyone until I'm at least 30. (lively jazz music) (both giggling) - Ladies and gentlemen, would you please take your partners for the last Waltz. (light jazz music) - Here I am, Audra. - Excuse me, my dance I think. Sorry, but she did promise me. (light jazz music) - That was an outright lie. - An outright lie, was it? Fine, but you did want to dance with me, didn't you? (light jazz music) - Well, look at that. Charlie's not good enough for her, but she'll dance with Vincent Crowther. - Do you know him then? - Well, I know his reputation. - You don't come from Armley. I'd have noticed you if you did. - No, I'm staying with a friend, Gwen Thornton. That was her brother. - Ah, I know the Thornton's. So where do you come from then? - Ripon. I'm a nurse at the Fever Hospital. - Oh, so you do work then (chuckles)? (light jazz music) Do you work every Sunday? - Why? - Because that's when I'm taking you out. (light jazz music) There's eight of us, I'm the oldest and the better looking. Then there's Olive, she's the married one. Laurette, Frank, Jack, Maggie, Danny, he's only six. Um, I've forgotten somebody. (bell ringing) Oh, right, oh, Billy. - Must be lovely having a big family like that. - (chuckles) The place is like a madhouse, what, with the kids and the trains. - Trains? - Aye, Dad's the local stationmaster. How long is it since your brother's immigrated? - Seven years now. They said they'd send for me, but they haven't had it too easy. - Nor have you by the sound of it. - I survived. - Must be tougher than you look. It's funny, when I first clapped eyes on you, I took you for one of the silver spoon set. The sort who'd never want for anything. - I suppose that's what I was until Mother died. - You put me in mind of one of those um, shiny ladies that you see in shop windows with signs on them saying don't touch. Perhaps that why I wanna touch you so much now. (light orchestral music) I thought you were gonna stand me up. - I thought you wouldn't come. That man will see. - Who cares? (light orchestral music) (train whistle blowing) (train rumbling) (bell ringing) - Have you taken many girls home? - None like you. - Oh, you're back already. Thought you were out with your latest heartthrob. - So I was and ah, I brought her home for tea. My mother, Dad, and ah, this is the rest of the rubble. - How do you do? - Come in, lass. - [Vincent] Your coat. - [Audra] Yes. - Shoo yourself, Frank. Get the young lady a seat. - Ah, Laurette, ah. - Thank you. - What's the matter with you all? Has the cat got your tongues? - You mustn't look until I tell you. (Vincent groans) Come on now, turn around. A little more towards me. Now to the right. Now, there. (dog barking) - [Vincent] Mm. - No, there. - That's High Cleugh? - You're disappointed. - Never realized it was as big as that. - It looks larger than it actually is. - It's a mansion filled with gardens. Nothing like our little patch out the back. - My mother planned and planted them. We used to help her. - You and your brothers? - And Uncle Peter. - Who was this Uncle Peter? - Oh, he wasn't really our uncle. He and mother were lovers. Although, I didn't understand that at the time. He was just a part of our lives for as long as I can remember. Well, I was only two when my father died. - Well, why didn't he marry her then, this Peter fella? - Well, he already had a wife. Although, I didn't know that either, until Mother died and High Cleugh reverted to his family. I suppose she wouldn't give him a divorce. - Do they live there then, his family? - No, they sold it to strangers. I hate to think of strangers living in High Cleugh. (melancholy music) - Perhaps, we shouldn't have come here. - No, I wanted to show it to you. It's so much a part of me. - And I want to know every part of you. (whimsical orchestral music) All right, we'll wait until we're wed. Well, you are gonna marry me, aren't you? - You said you weren't gonna get married until you were at least 30. - I've changed my mind. - You've hardly known him any time. - I don't need to. - Are you sure it isn't just an infatuation. I mean he's good looking and all. - Quite sure. - [Gwen] Look, I know you spurned our Charlie. - Oh, that's it, is it? That's why you don't like Vincent. - I never said I didn't like him. I mean he's very charming, but. - But what? - But the Crowther family. I mean, they're not exactly. - And I'm such a great catch, am I, a penniless orphan. - Well, you can't escape your background. You've got breeding and it shows. I mean, you could have the pick of all the blokes around here. - Honestly, I never realized what a dreadful snob you were. - And I never realized what a gullible little fool you were. - Oh, come on, Mom. You're just jealous because someone's hooked your favorite son. - Oh, get away with ya. Haven't I been persuading ya to settle down these past two years. - Well, I couldn't do better than Audra. You do like her, don't ya? - [Eliza] Oh, aye, she's a fine young woman. - Well, then. - She's from a different world than us, Vincent. You should've stuck to your first instinct. - Eh? - Her, didn't you tell me that when you saw her at that dance, you said to yourself, hands off? - Aye, but then I went down the pub, and I had a skinful before I came back. - Happen, you should've stayed there. - I love her, Mom. - I don't doubt that. There's more to marriage than love. (light organ music) - Isn't she lovely, Mom. She looks just like a film star. - Shh! (light organ music) - [Vicar] I Audra Edith do take thee Vincent. - It's too late to worry, love. What's done is done. - I Audra Edith take thee, Vincent, to be my wedded husband. - [Vicar] To have and to hold from this day forward. - To have and to hold from this day forward. - [Vicar] For better, for worse, for richer, for poorer. - For better, for worse, for richer, for poorer. - [Vicar] In sickness and in health. - [Audra] In sickness and in health. - [Vicar] To love, cherish, and obey. - [Audra] To love, cherish, and obey. - [Vicar] Till death us do part. - Till death us do part. - [Vicar] With this ring, I thee wed. - With this ring, I thee wed. - [Vicar] With my body, I thee worship. - With my body, I thee worship. What's the matter, love? Aren't you happy? - When I first came into the church, and saw all your family sitting there, and only a handful of friends on my side, I felt so alone. - You'll never be alone again. (whimsical orchestral music) - Don't hurt me. (whimsical orchestral music) (birds chirping) - I can't believe it's nearly over. - Well, the honeymoon may be over, but we've got a lot to look forward to. I can't wait until we move into the cottage. - With barely a stick of furniture. - There's something I forgot to tell you. - Later. What did you wanna tell me? - Later. - Well, it's you, Audra. - Good afternoon, Aunt Alicia. - But the maid said a Mr. and Mrs. Crowther. - That's right, I'm Mrs. Crowther. I'd like to introduce you to my husband. - Please to meet you, Mrs. Drummond. I've heard a lot about you. - How do you do? Well, why on earth didn't you tell us you were getting married, you silly child? - I was 21 last month. Well, that's why I'm here. I've come to collect my things. - Things? - Mother's things that you've been storing for me. We made an inventory, remember? My solicitor has a copy too. - Oh, a few worthless things. - In that case, you won't miss them then, will ya? Me and me brother will be over with a cart next Saturday. - Meantime, I'd like to take that picture there. - [Vincent] Oh, this one, you mean? - Yes, my father painted it. - Don't you dare touch my picture! - [Audra] It's not your painting. - Leave it alone! - It's part of Mother's legacy. - Your mother, don't talk to me about that woman. She was nothing but a whore. - Wait a minute, no one talks to my wife like that! - Well, that's what she was! Little slut carrying on with that philanderer while poor Adrian was still alive. - That's not true. - Humiliating him in front of the servants, treating him like dirt! - She would never have done that or Uncle Peter. - And she not fit to lick his boots! - They loved each other, it was real! - Come on, Audra, we're going! But I'll be back for the rest of the stuff, and it better all be there or else. (dramatic music) (whimsical orchestral music) - [Driver] Whoa! (whimsical orchestral music) - It's what I've dreamt of all these years. - Well, it's not quite up to High Cleugh. - Next best. (both chuckling) Oh, I do love you, Vincent. (whimsical orchestral music) (door thuds) - [Vincent] Mm! - Later, the meal will spoil. - Who cares, mm. - I do, there's something special to celebrate. - Celebrate what? - We've been married a month. (Vincent laughing) You go up and wash and I'll get it ready. Oh, Vince. (mellow music) - What's up, is the gas off? (Audra giggles) What's so funny? - Nothing (giggling). - [Vincent] Hey? - (giggling) No, nothing (giggling). (goats bleating) - Morning Mrs. Crowther! - Morning! - Audra, there you are. Painting, as usual? - Lord, is it that time, I'm sorry. (lips smacking) What do you think? - Very pretty, what's for tea? - Dinner. - Dinner (chuckles). - Shepherd's pie. Hang on, so what sort of day did you have? - Tiring, that foreman's a slave driver. - Oh, well, nevermind, we'll have an early night. - Ah no, I said I'd meet some of the lads later. They'll have forgotten what I look like down the pub. - Can I come too? - No, our womenfolk don't go down pub. I'll tell ya what. So you don't get lonesome. Why don't you spend the evening with Mom and Laurette, eh? - And would you believe it, the ruddy creature pulls up 20 yards from the post, and starts chewing the grass. And 50 to one, he would've beat as well. Here, is that Gwen Thornton's fella? - Who's Gwen Thornton? - You know her. Audra's la ti da friend. What's he doing slumming it? It's Mike, isn't it? - Hello, Vincent. - What're you doing down this end? - I heard they serve the best beer in Leeds. - Discriminating lad. - I like to get away from the medical crowd. As a subject for conversation, diseases of the intestine has its limits. (both chuckling) - Excuse me, lads. - [Vincent] Right. - [Man] Thank you. - How's married life? - Oh, nothing like it. You and Gwen should get a move on. - I shan't be qualified for another two years, and I've no private money. - Yeah, but you're guaranteed a decent job at the end, aren't you? You won't be joining a dole queue. - How are things in the building trade? - Varley's have just landed a big contract building warehouses. Audra's on me to go to night school learn draftsmanship. - Will you? - I may get around to it. Trouble is, there's so many pleasanter ways of spending an evening, aren't there? - Five minutes since you last looked. - I'm sorry, it was just he said it would be a couple of hours. - Once they get with their mates, they soon lose track of time. - You don't begrudge Vincent a bit of harmless pleasure, do ya? - No, of course not. - Because that's the way it is with our men. They toil out all day and go to pub every night. Well, that's their way of relaxing. - You'll soon get used to it. - Best to, because that's how it's going to be from now on. (clock ticking) (tram humming) (bell tolling) - Audra, excuse me. Oh, thank God you made it, oh. - Isn't that, is that Jeffrey Freemantle? - Yes, well, didn't I tell you? He's working here now. - Hmm, well I was going to ask if you could find me a job too. Now I'm not so sure. - Actually, he's been quite nice. I suppose being new here I suppose. Anyway, what's all this about you getting a job? You're a married woman now, Audra. You shouldn't have to work. - Leeds United Mill Arsenal, 108. (Vincent laughing) - Come here. What's say you we have an early night? - Ought to be a change for you. - Oh, don't go on about that again. - Well, it was after midnight. - It was Frank's birthday. - Well, I still don't see why I couldn't have come too. - Well, let's make up for lost time now, eh? (Vincent grunts) - (giggles) We'll have to get that sofa soon. - What's wrong with the floor? - Now, come on, Vincent. - [Vincent] Why not? - No, for heaven's sake, we're not animals. I'm sorry, it just doesn't seem right. - But it would be all right on the sofa? - I know, it's silly. - Well, we'd better hurry up and buy one then, haven't we? - Actually, I saw just the thing in town yesterday, real leather. - Hoo, that costs a bit. - Yes, but I've been thinking, what if I were to get a job? - A job? - Well, only part-time. Gwen had a word with the matron at the infirmary and she said-- - You're not going out to work. - But I'd like to. - But you've already got a job, woman, looking after me and the house. - It's not enough. Besides, we need the extra money. - Over my dead body. - It seems just a waste of all my training. I'm sitting here all day and dusting-- - Look, Audra, I'm not having my wife working and that's flat. What would me mates say? - Who's more important, me or your mates? - They'd say I wasn't man enough to keep ya, that's what. - That's absolute nonsense. - Oh, absolute nonsense, is it? - Yes, it is, other women work. - That don't make it right. - Oh, you're so numb. - Well, you should've thought of that before you married me, shouldn't ya? - Well, maybe yes, I should! (dramatic music) Don't let's quarrel. I hate it when we quarrel. - It's worth it for the making up. - Vincent. - We'll go upstairs. - Vincent, you seem to think that sex can solve everything. - So it can. - No, I think we should sit down and have a civilized discussion. - Oh, do ya? Well, I'm not civilized as you've rather pointed out. I'm just an uneducated clod who happens to think that a wife's job is to be a wife. - Where are you going? - Where do you think? To have a drink with my uncivilized friends. - Oh, Vincent, Vincent! (dramatic music) - [Vincent] How do? What's up, Master Danny. - [Janet] Hey, Vince! - Hello, Maggie, what do you say? And how's Johnnie, all right? Up? Good evening one and all. - Look what the wind's blowing in. - Hello, Mom. - I'll put the kettle on. - I can't stop. We've got company tonight. - I didn't think you're dressed up like that for us. - Evening, Dad. (Dad grunts) What's your fancy for the 2:30 tomorrow? - Golden Echo, come all the way down from Bishop Auckland. Bishop Auckland he'd be knackered by now surely (chuckles). So where's the latest recruit to His Majesty's Army? - Upstairs. - I'll tell him your here. (train rumbling) Frank, Vincent's here! - [Frank] All right! - So you've finally given permission to join up then? - Not much else for the lad, is there? Not with the way things are in this country now. There's more getting laid off everyday. - You're all right at Varley's, aren't you, Vincent? They're not having any problems. - No, we're gonna build out for old man Belfry actually. - Hmm, glad to hear it. A girl like Audra wouldn't take too well to life on the dole. - So, you got the sofa in the end. - Yes, delivered last week. - Oh, it looks lovely. The whole place does. - It's warm. - But you've done wonders. (glasses clink) Oh, where's Vincent? - At his mother's. He'll be back in time for supper. - He's down there a lot, isn't he? - I think he misses all the rough and tumble. - Actually, I'm glad he's not here yet. There's something I want to tell you. - What? - (giggles) Well, it's not official yet, but I might soon be following in your footsteps, getting married. - Wow! (both giggling) Gwen, how wonderful. - I can't stop into the pub, Dad. I promised Audra I'll be home by seven. - [Dad] Hmm, to my way of thinking, you should cut down on your visits to The Station anyway. - [Vincent] Here, have you been talking to my Audra? - Nay, but I have eyes in my head. She's not like our girls, Vincent. You can't expect her to put up with things the way they do. - (scoffs) Anyway, I can't change the habits of a lifetime. - You have to make allowances for other people, son. Especially people from other walks. - [Vincent] I am trying, Dad. I mean, take tonight. I can be bending over backwards to be charming to Miss Gwen Thornton who gives me the ruddy pip. Anyway, have one for me, so long. - [Audra] Oh, there's Vincent now. - Evening, Gwen, nice to see you. You're looking lovelier than ever. - Well, thank you. - And how's life treating you then? - Couldn't be better. Shall I tell him, Audra? - [Vincent] Tell me what? - I'm about to get engaged. - Oh, congratulations. Mind you, I'm not surprised. I knew you and Mike wouldn't wait much longer. - It's not Mike. - You are? - It's Jeffrey Freemantle. One of the senior doctors at the infirmary. - You mean you've ditched Mike Leslie? - Well, I wouldn't put it like that. - My God, the poor blighter. He thinks the world of you, Gwen. - I know that and I'm very fond of him, but when Jeffrey came along, I realized that-- - You must be mad. - Vincent. - You're making a big mistake, you know? They don't come better than Mike Leslie. - I don't think this is any of your business. - No, it isn't. - No, I'm only trying to make her see sense. Mike's worth 10 of your stuffed shirt consultants, however much money they earn. - I'm sorry, Audra. You'll have to excuse me. - Gwen, don't go. - I am not staying to have Jeffrey insulted. I'll be in touch. Don't bother to see me out. - The silly thing is I feel the same as Vincent. Mike and Gwen are so well suited. That Jeffery Freemantle (scoffs). He's not right for her, Laurette. - He's older than Gwen, isn't he? - Hmm, 15 years, I think. It's not only that. He's, he's gonna try and change her. I know he will. He's gonna try and make her into the sort of wife he wants, instead of just our Gwenny. - It's funny how people always try to change the people they love. - Yes. - You and her have been together a long time, haven't you? - Since we we're both 16. There's never been anyone else. - I think of the girls I went through before Audra. - First time I saw her it was at this party of Charlie's. He said he had a sister, but I hadn't pictured anything like Gwen. All the other girls were sitting there demurely. Suddenly, she burst in in this rainbow colored dress. As if the whole room lit up. - Yeah, it was like that when I first met Audra. There might've been no one else there. - Difference is you've got Audra. (clock ticking) (patrons chattering) - Here. Maybe we oughta find out if we can fix you up with someone else. What about our sister, Laurette? You met her at our wedding. She's a good looker though I say if myself, and sweet natured too. - Look, Vincent, I know you mean well, but just leave it alone, will ya? - Well, don't have a go at me, mate. You'd be better off with our Laurette then you would with that peg nosed little madam. - I said leave it alone. - Or maybe my family's not good enough for you either. (train rumbling) Audra. (Audra moans) - I'm asleep. - I'll soon wake you up. (mellow music) - I, I can't, I can't just switch on because you happen to feel like it. - You didn't used to find it difficult. - You didn't used to come home at this hour drunk. - You're enough to drive a bloke to drink. - Stop it! - You're my wife, for Christ's sake. - It doesn't give you the right. - Oh, doesn't it? (dramatic music) (birds chirping) - If it isn't Vincent Crowther. - Millie Arnold. - Good looking as ever. - (chuckles) I'm sorry to hear about Ted. I tried to make it to the funeral, but. - Yeah, I hear your married now. - Aye. - So someone pinned you down at last. She must be a rare girl and a lucky one. - (chuckles) So how are you, Millie. You coping all right? - Ah, I shouldn't complain. Ted left me well enough provided for. When I look at those poor devils, I thank my lucky stars. - Must be lonesome for you though, eh? - I wouldn't say no to a bit company down there. - Still living down the Passages? - Aye, if you're passing any time, feel like a beer, something. - I may well take you up on that. I'll see you. All right then. What's so important it can't wait till after supper? - This, came today from Wigful's in Leeds. - Aye? - Oh, aye, is that all? - So I missed a couple of payments. - They're threatening legal action. You never told me you bought the sofa on hire purchase, and the bed and the wardrobe. - How else did you think I paid for them? - [Audra] Your savings, of course. - Savings, that's a laugh. The last of my savings went on clothes for the wedding, and the honeymoon, and all the rest of that stuff. - Well, why didn't you tell me? I couldn't sold a piece of Mother's jewelry. - I'm not a sponger. That's your stuff. - Oh, don't be so stupid. It belongs to us both. - Not to my way of thinking, it don't. - And you made me turn down that job. - Oh, don't start going on about that again. - At least I could've helped pay off some of this debt. - Look, I'm the man in this house, and if there's any debts to be paid, I'll pay them! - I believe you'd rather go to jail than let me help you. - At least I'd get some peace there. - We're living beyond our means! - Well, maybe you should've married some pillar of society like your friend, Gwen. Maybe you're right. I'm beginning to wonder. - Me too. (dramatic music) - [Audra] We're living beyond our means. - [Vincent] Well, maybe you should've married a pillar of society like your friend, Gwen. - [Eliza] That's the way it is with our men. - [Laurette] You'll soon get used to it. - [Eliza] She best do, because that's how it's going to be from now on. - [Matron] I believe you have a true gift for healing, Audra. Don't waste it, will you? (mellow music) - [Audra] I Audra Edith, take thee, Vincent, to be my wedded husband. To have and to hold from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, till death us do part. (mellow music) (tram bell ringing) (thunder rumbling) (wind whooshing) - [Laurette] Audra, what you doing here? - Waiting for a tram. I'm leaving him. - Oh no, you can't. Have you had a row? - We're always having rows. - Oh, Audra, but surely that doesn't mean you have to and leave. - Please, Laurette, don't make me change my mind. - Where will you go? You've no one but us. - Back to Ripon. Matron Lennox will give me a job in the hospital. - You'll be admitted as a patient if you sit around in the cold much longer. Here's the rain too. Let me take you back to the cottage and we can-- - I'm not going back there. - Well, come back with me to my mom's just for tonight. At least it'll be warm and dry there. (rain pattering) - So what kind of silliness is this then, lass? - It's not silliness. I just don't see any point in our being together. - Beating you, has he? - No. - Chasing after other women? - No. - Then what's all this about him treating you badly? - (sniffs) I'm just tired of being on my own (sniffs). Wouldn't be so bad if he'd let me go back to nursing. - He wouldn't feel like a man if his wife went out to work. - But it's all right for him to get into debt, is it? He went out, bought some things on the hire purchase, and now he's behind on the payments. - I know that was rash of him. But you must let him deal with it himself. You take my advice. You go home and try to understand Vincent better. - But I do try. You didn't want us to get married in the first place. - Well, only because I thought you'd end up wanting different lives, the pair of ya. And I wasn't far wrong by the look of it. - Well, you see, it's better for us to part now, when we're still-- - Oh, yes, you'd have it that easy, wouldn't ya? Marry in haste, repent in leisure. That's what I said to Vincent, but would he listen to me, oh no. Well, you've made your bed, the pair of ya, and you'll have to lie in it, lumpy mattress or no. Laurette, please mush! - [Laurette] Coming, Mom! - But it's up to you, lass, to make it work. - Me, what about him? - It's never the man that makes a marriage work. It's always the woman. - But that's not fair. - Whoever said a woman's life was fair. - Hello, Mom, just thought I'd drop in me way home. Audra, what're you doing here, love? (dramatic music) You feeling ill? You look dreadful. (melancholy music) - You won't make me change my mind. I'm leaving in the morning. - No, you won't. You're not going anywhere in the morning. You'll be seeing Dr. Stalkey. Well? - Oh, it's influenza, I'm afraid. There's a lot of it going around now in Armley. So see she stays in bed and give her plenty of liquids. - Right. - It'll just have to take its course. - I see. - Oh, by the way, Vincent, there is something else. Um, it'll have to be confirmed, but I'll lay you 10 to one, she's pregnant. (whimsical music) - Oh, Audra, it's wonderful news! I can't wait to tell me mom and dad. And you were talking about leaving me. - I can't now, can I? - Oh, don't look at it like that. I love you, Audra, and you love me too, I know you do. - I love you all right, but loving is not enough. - It'll work out, you'll see. It's just what we need. And I promise, I'll be a better husband too. I won't go out so much in the evening, and you needn't worry about them bills. I had word from Fred Varley, and guess what? He's gonna make me foreman when Jim Meadows retires next month. - (sniffs) Well, that's good. - Aye, our son will want for nothing. - Or daughter. - No, it's a boy. I can feel it in me bones. And we'll name him after both our dads, Alfred Adrian Crowther, hmm. - I settled on the crinoline wedding gown in the end. Cream lace over satin, and I'm having the longest train you've ever seen. 11 foot of lace. - You'll look like a dream. - Oh, I hope so. I do want Jeffrey to be proud of me. Come on, let's sit down. Mustn't overdo it. Remember what the doctor said. So are you feeling any better? - Well, I haven't been so sick lately, but um, one way or the other, I always seem to be out of sorts. - Oh, first pregnancy's never easy, and coming on top of the influenza. So mind you take good care of yourself, my girl. Oh, did I tell you? Jeffrey's leaving the infirmary. Well, he's going to take consulting rooms in Park Place in Leeds. Which will mean he'll be treating all sorts of smart people. So there will be lots of entertaining. That's why he's going to buy me a whole new wardrobe. - That'll be nice. - Oh, whatever happens, Audra, we'll always remain friends, won't we? - Of course we will. - Excuse me, love. - [Audra] Mm hmm. Oh, do you have to go to York, to stay over, I mean? - It's only for a few days, love. I've gotta get the lads moving on this job. Can't afford to slip up on it. Don't worry, Laurette will sleep over with you. - Your family's been so good to me. - Aye, well, they regard you as one of us now. (Audra gasps) - Audra, what is it? - Laurette, I think the baby's starting. - Oh, it can't be. - [Audra] Oh (gasping)! - It's not due for another two months. (telephone ringing) - Hello, who? Yes, he is, but sort of time is this to call? Oh, I see. Yeah, yeah, hang on. I'll go and wake him. Mr. Crowther! - Perhaps I should. - Oh, they'll let us know. (Audra grunting) - Keep pushing, keep pushing, keep pushing, keep pushing! Here it is! There's a good girl! There's a good girl! (whimsical orchestral music) - My name's Crowther. My wife's having a baby. - Take a seat, please, Mr. Crowther. - No, I've got to find out what's going on. - Mr. Crowther, please! - Mom, Dad, thank God you're here. Is she all right? - Aye, lad, she's all right. - The baby? - He only lived for half an hour. (melancholy music) (Vincent crying) - Why? (melancholy music) (Audra crying) - Oh, Audra, and to think I was away when it all happened. - At least I saw him. I held him. He existed. Let's go and have a cup of tea. I want to hear all about your honeymoon. - Not today, seems so trivial after-- - I can't go on mourning forever. So how was it all? - Oh, wonderful, absolutely wonderful. - You went to Paris first then? - Yes, yes, we stayed at The Ritz, and Jeffery bought me a whole new wardrobe, and then we went to the Riviera. (hooves thudding) - I've seen her several times since and it's always the same. Well, she puts on a brave face, but somehow the light's gone out of her eyes. - Not like you. It's come back into yours. - I'm pregnant again. - I thought so. I'm so glad. - Vincent's the only one who knows. - How do you feel about it? - I know it's going to be all right, and I know it's going to be a girl. I've even decided on a name for her. (baby cooing) Christina, Christina. - Christina! - [All] Christina! - I'm a dad (laughs)! - It's handmade, I couldn't resist it. - Oh, Gwen, how extravagant, it's beautiful. - Well, a beautiful dress for a beautiful baby. Oh, she's lovely, Audra. You are lucky. I wish I could get pregnant. - You will, just give it time. - Jeffrey says it's all in my mind. I'm too anxious. - How is Jeffrey? - Oh, he's fine. By the way, how are your brothers? Well, they can't have heard they're uncles yet, can they? - Didn't I tell you? Frederick's getting engaged. (Gwen gasps) He's going to, Gwen? (dramatic music) What is that? - Oh, I fell down the cellar steps the other day, silly me. Oh, Jeffrey was furious with me for being so clumsy. Said I could've broken my neck. Anyway, let me put this in some water. Well, they'll be dead before someone brings a vase. They're not up to our standard, are they, these nurses? (whimsical orchestral music) - Alfred, look. And Maggie. - Come here, you'll frighten her, here. See? (whimsical orchestral music) (Christina crying) - Shh. - Name this child. - [Gwen And Mike] Christina Edith Crowther. - Christina Edith Crowther, I baptize thee, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, amen. (Christina crying) - Vincent was so right to make us come out. Takes me back to when Gwen and I were nursing. - How is Gwen? - I haven't seen her since the Christening. Vincent says she's getting too grand for me, but I think she's trying to hide the fact that she and Jeffrey aren't very happy. - Mike's still in love with her, you know? - [Audra] Did he tell you? - He doesn't need to. - Let's have a nice spot of tea before we go home. - We can't stay away long enough for our Maggie. She adores looking after that baby. My feet are killing me. - Mine too, but it was worth it. - Audra, Laurette, come quickly. - What is it, Maggie? - It's our Christy. I think she's right colic. (Christina crying) She started to get fratchy after Vincent and Jack went off to the football match. I kept going to check her, Audra. Honest, I did. - She's very hot. Laurette, run to the bathroom, get the thermometer. It's in the medicine chest. - [Laurette] Right. - Maggie, you clear the table and put a clean towel on it. - [Maggie] What do you think it is? - Could be measles or chicken pox. There's no rash though. - I didn't know what to do. I took her on my lap, and then she started to be sick. - She was sick? - Aye, and in ever such a funny way. - How do you mean funny? - Well, like. - Describe the way she vomited. - It's difficult to-- - Try, it's important. - Well, it sort of came straight out of her like someone gave her a great thump on the back. - Maggie, run right down to Dr. Stalkey. - Yes, but-- - Go on, tell him the baby's sick and he's to come immediately. - It's nothing serious, is it? - Just tell him what you told me. - What do you think it is? - I hope to God I'm wrong. A combination of high fever and projectile vomiting could be meningitis. (dramatic music) - There's no doubt about it. She's in a bad way. I'll have her admitted to the fetal wing at once. - Is it meningitis? You can tell me. I'm a qualified nurse. (dramatic music) - She must've come in contact with someone with TB. - You're a medical, tell me honestly. What are her chances? - If she was older, but with an infant that age. - God wouldn't do it to us, not a second time. - Oh, Mrs. Crowther. I'm sorry, there's nothing more you can do. She's in good hands. - I want to stay. - I'm afraid that's out of the question. She'll need careful nursing and constant observation. - I'd like, I'd like to look after her myself. - My dear, this kind of nursing is highly specialized. - I, I've nursed children with meningitis before. - Mrs. Crowther, there are regulations. - I don't care about the regulations! I'm her mother! - I understand how you feel, but I'm--. - Please, my baby may be dying. I have a right to-- - What's going on here? - Oh, Matron, I'm afraid Mrs. Crowther. - Audra. - Matron Lennox, oh, thank God. (melancholy music) You're going to do it, Christina. You're going to live. (Christina crying) I know, I know, but it'll make you feel better. Poor little thing. (Christina crying) - You mean they're letting her nurse the baby herself? - Aye, it's special dispensation. - It's not her I doubt. - Well, Matron Lennox knew her at Ripon. She says if anyone could pull Christina through, it's Audra. (Christina cooing) - [Doctor] I'll just put the local in now. (Christina crying) Hold her very still now. And I think that's okay. Now, take the needle out. Get a little fluid in a moment. Now, there we are and it looks a little cloudy. - [Audra] There, darling. (Christina crying) Shh, shh, now. (dramatic music) (Christina crying) (whimsical orchestral music) - Matron! Gwen Freemantle, well, Thornton, it was. I was with you at Ripon. - Of course, Audra's friend. - Yes, well, she told me you were matron here now. - So sorry I didn't recognize you. It was the veil. You look as though you've been in the wars. - Yes, walked into a cupboard door the other day. Of all the ridiculous things. How's the baby doing? - She's out of danger now, making progress. - Oh, it's a miracle, an act of God. - I'd call it an act of will. - You're home, Christina. (Christina cooing) - I'll just get to bed. Early start in the morning. Mr. Varley wants to see me first thing. - You don't mind me sleeping with her, do you? - As long as it's not for good. You don't know how I've missed you this past month. - To think we almost lost her. She's never going to want for anything. I'm going to give her the world. (dramatic music) - [Man] Good morning. - How do? Morning, Mr. Varley. I got your message. - All right, come on in, Vincent. - Thanks. Should be finished down at Brownlies by about noon tomorrow. The lads are doing right well. It's a fine bit of building though I say it myself. - I'm sure it is. You're a good worker and you're a good foreman, best I've had. That's why this isn't gonna be easy. I've got to close down. - Close Varley's? - I'm going into bankruptcy. - Oh, my God. - No alternative. - But why, we've had plenty of contracts in the last year. - Ah, but half the builders haven't paid up. I've been working off credit for the past few months. I'm mortgaged up to the hilt. The banks won't lend me any more. I'm sorry, Vincent. - How am I gonna tell Audra? - What? - He can afford to pay us till the end of the week. No notice, no bonus, nothing. - What are your chances of being taken on by another firm? - None, I've asked around. They're in the same boat as laying blokes off. - How much have we got saved? - Enough to last us a month. Ah, I'll find something. There must be some casual work about. - I'll take in dressmaking. I've been asked before and it's something I can do at home. - No, no, no, no. - Oh, Vincent, you can't afford to be proud now. We've got Christina to think of. - There had to be a price, didn't there? ♪ Peace on earth and mercy mild ♪ ♪ God and sinners reconciled ♪ ♪ Joyful, all ye nations, rise ♪ ♪ Join the triumph of the skies ♪ - Same again? - My shot, Mike. - [Mike] No, really. - Two pints, please. Millie Arnold. - Hello, Vincent. - I didn't know you were working here. - Just a couple of times a week. Gives me something to do with an evening. - I meant to drop in and see you, but somehow, ah, you know. - Invitation's still open. - Cheers. - [Vincent] So they were pleased with her at the hospital, were they? - Oh, delighted, she's amazing for 15 months. - Ah, she's my little smasher. The only thing about being on the dole is I get to see more of her. (patrons chattering) Well, here's to your new job in London. - Thanks. - We'll miss ya, but it's good to know somebody in this ruddy country's working. - Still no joy? - Oh, didn't I tell ya? I've landed a right plum job for tomorrow shoveling snow. That was only after dragging around all the posh houses in manor row, and soft talking the housekeepers. I've tried everything, Mike. - How are you managing? - Audra's paying most of the bills with her dressmaking work, isn't she? No wonder she don't think of me as a man anymore. - I'm sure that's not true. - Well, she does precious little to show it. (patrons chattering) (suspenseful music) (doorbell ringing) - Good afternoon, Mrs. Harris. - Mrs. Crowther. - Mrs. Freemantle asked me to tea. - I'm afraid there must be some mistake. The madam's gone out for the afternoon. - But I just saw her at the window. - Oh, but you couldn't have. It must've been one of the maids. - You're lying. - I'm not. - Let me in, I want to speak-- - No, I'm sorry, the master said-- - What did he say, Mrs. Harris? - That I wasn't to allow anyone to see her. - But he's not here now, is he? Thank you. (suspenseful music) (knocking on door) Gwen, it's me. Can I come in? (suspenseful music) Oh, my poor Gwenny. (Gwen crying) Gwen, oh. Oh, did he do this to you? (Gwen cries) - Oh, I'm so frightened of him, Audra (crying). - How long has this been going on? - Since the first few months. I could never live up to his standards (crying). - You must leave him at once. Go back to your parents. - I can't, it would kill mother. Oh, I don't want her to know. - I'll tell you what. You come and stay with us just until you get yourself sorted out. Yes, I'm going to get Vincent to help you collect the bags. You start packing. I'm not letting you stay here. - I never thought it would end like this. You told me I was a fool to marry him. - Aye, and you told Audra she'd be a fool to marry me. Happen we were both right. (door thuds) (suspenseful music) - Where are you going? I told you not to go out. (suspenseful music) What are you doing with that? - I'll tell you what she's doing. She's leaving with me now. Don't. (fists thudding) (men grunting) (Vincent gasps) - It's a nasty cut. - (chuckles) It's nothing to what he got. - Well, I hope he doesn't try and come around here. - He won't, I told him what'd happen if he tried to get in touch with Gwen again. I said we'd drag his name into the Sunday papers and make sure all his patients get a complimentary copy. - I do believe you enjoyed it. - I did, every minute of it. But I'll tell you what I'd prefer. What if we go upstairs for an hour? - (chuckles) Gwen might hear. - Oh, I see. That's gonna be the new excuse, is it? Well, I suppose it's better than being tired or the time of the month. - Shh, keep your voice down. - Why don't you just tell the truth. That you don't want me anymore? - Oh, don't be so silly. - I get more reaction from an iceberg! - I do want you. It's just, I'm so afraid of getting pregnant. - So what if you did? - We can't afford it. We've hardly enough as it is. - Well, don't blame me for that. - I don't, I don't blame you. - Blame the blasted government! - Of course it's not your fault. But if we had another baby, it would jeopardize Christina's chances. - For God's sake, woman, the child's not two years old, and you're talking about her future already! - She won't have a future if I don't plan for it. Oh, go on, you're gonna run to your mother, and she'll make a fuss of you, and give you the money for the pub like she always does! (mellow music) - I hope that wasn't my fault. - No, Gwen, it was mine. (suspenseful music) (knocking on door) - Hello, Millie. - Vincent. - Can I come in. - I was feeling like some company. That's nasty, would you like to stay for supper? - Yeah, I think I would. - You know, Christy, I used to come here sometimes with Mother, and Freddie, and William, and we'd sit under this very same tree, and the boys would play down by the stream there, build dams, make boats out of sticks. Can I move now, Christy? - It's all right now, Mommy. (birds chirping) No doubt about it. She's got real talent. - [Vincent] Hmm? - Our Christy, going to be a fine painter one day. - Aye, she takes after you and your dad. - Oh, she's going to be better than I ever was. Maybe better than Father too. Come on, collect up the rubbish. - Oh, do we have to leave just now? Can't I lie here a bit longer? - No, wish we could stay, but we've got to be getting back. She's got her homework to do. - On a Saturday? - Well, she won't get into Miss Mellows unless she does a bit extra. - Get where? - Miss Mellows Girls School. I put her down to sit the exam. - What, the posh one with the fancy uniform? - Well, I've taught her all I can, and I want her to go to the art school in Leeds when she's old enough, and after that to one of those colleges in London. - This is only a temporary job you know? Even if I got a permanent one, we couldn't afford all that. - We could if I took on some private nursing as well as the dressmaking. They're looking for a night nurse for old Mrs. Jarvis-- - No, Audra, you work all hours as it is. - I'm not having her held back through lack of money. I am going to make sure she gets her chance whatever it costs. - Audra's too full of her grand ideas. It will only lead to trouble. - Well, Eliza, you're being hard on the lass. It's not wrong in reaching to the stars. - So long as they don't fall flat on their face while they're about it. - Take no orders over. (train whistle blowing) (train rumbling) She'll have other things to occupy her mind soon. Reckon we all will. Seen this? (clock ticking) (bell tolling) (Audra sighs) (pan thuds) (light orchestral music) - [Christina] Look, Daddy, look at my new uniforms. - Stand still, isn't she smart? - She's quite the young lady. - I can't wait for term to start. - Hey, Audra, listen. (light orchestral music) Do you remember that tune? - Of course I do. - What is it? - It's called "When We Kiss Goodnight". It's the first dance I had with your mother. May I have the pleasure? One, two, three. (light orchestral music) (Christina giggling) - Come on, Mommy. (light orchestral music) (Vincent chuckles) (Christina giggles) - Thank you. (all laughing) - [Radio Announcer] This is London. At 11:15, in about two minutes, the Prime Minister will broadcast to the nation. (bells ringing) - Audra I don't know when the recruitment offices will open, but um, I attend to volunteer. - Don't. Vincent, don't. Don't. - Volunteering, ain't it enough the young ones will be going? - I thought maybe you could say something. - Me, since when did he listen to me? (train rumbling) - I can't understand it. I mean at his age and when there's Christy to think of. - Can't ya, I can. At least this way he can stand up and be a man. - And what's that supposed to mean? - How do you think it is for him? His wife working nights as well as days. His mates snickering at him. - Do you think I want it like that? It's not my fault he can't earn enough-- - It would be enough for any normal woman, but you wouldn't settle for our ways of life, would ya? Too busy dreaming up grand plans for Christina. - Is it wrong to want the best for your child? - It depends on the price you have to pay. - Christy has a real talent for art. I am not letting her waste it. - Then don't ask me why Vincent's going off to the war, and don't blame me if he gets himself killed! Audra, you might be able to stop him going even now. Just give up all these Christy nonsense, and go back to being a proper wife for him. It's your choice! - No, Mom, it's not as simple as that.
