You're a slut! -Hey! -They're too many. Ouch! Help! Poor girl. It could be a hazing ritual. Don't try to be a hero, Mariel! You did! You stole my man! You slut! I haven't done anything to you! Help! - Hey! Wait a minute! - Stop it! Stop it! Hold it! Let's talk about this! What is there to talk about? I didn't steal anyone from you! He told me you were broken up! We didn't break up!

I'm sorry, but I have to ask you this. What's with that guy that you were willing to get yourself killed for him? Well... He's gorgeous. Kind. At least, I thought he was kind but I guess not. For real? You didn't know they were still together? Hey! Believe me. I'm not that kind of girl. I would never do that. Promise! Cross my heart! I swear on my own life. I wouldn't do that. -No! No! -Okay, relax! Okay, okay. I believe you. Besides, my getting beat up would have been pointless... if you were really at fault. Well, thank you, my she-ro! Here's my peace offering to you.

Why are we hiding? Janice! Nothing, sorry. That's my Dad. He only comes home when he gets tired of his mistress. But once he gets a new one, he disappears again. Sorry. I'm sure your parents are looking for you. Sorry. It's okay. My Mom's in Norway. She has a new family there. My Dad is dead. Nobody's waiting for me. So it's cool. Well, where do you want to go?

I've been texting Kiko nonstop but he isn't replying. So annoying! Hey! You have a crush on him, don't you? -Introduce yourself. -No, Deena! I don't want to! What are you... It's 2006 already!

So you shut the hell up, okay! No! You shut the hell up! You don't know me! But I know well enough that men like you who treat women this way... deserve to rot in hell! And, you don't get to break up with my best friend. Because she is dumping you and your micro-dick! Let's go. You argue so well in English. I could get a nosebleed. There. There she is. -You said, you loved me. -We can't carry her. -You said you'll always love me. -Deena, come on. -Hold on. -Come on. -You're a dick, right? -Deena! Everything I had, I gave to you! But you left me! Why? -You jerk! -Wait! Stop it, Deena! You're just the same! You'll leave me like my Mom did. Okay then, bye! -Bye! Leave already. -That's enough. Come on. You're drunk. That's enough, Deena! Hey! If you don't quit it, I'm going to call the police! Sorry. Come on. Eat. Take a bite. Stop thinking about him. Or you'll grow ugly. How nice of you... that you love me. I love you, Mamee. I love you all. - It's okay, Deena. - Hush now. Okay, last question. What is the Quadratic Formula? -Ax2 + bx... -Tash! -Luke! -What are you doing here? I'm asking Ms Mariel to tutor me in Algebra. This is my cousin, Luke. Hello, how do you do? -I'm Luke. -Hi. Wait, you look familiar. Do we know each other? Mariel! Maybe we had PE together. - Yes, chess! - I beat you to it. -I let you win! -Of course not! Hi! Sorry. I'm Deena. Sorry, my friend and I have an emergency. If you want, you can send her a text message. She's kidding. - I have to go. - Okay. -Nice to meet you. -Ms Mariel, the money! -Sorry. -Thank you. See you. Sorry, Mamee. It's really an emergency. You're making me nervous. What happened? Hey, talk to me! - Sorry! Sorry! - What the... how rude! -Help me. I'm scared. -What are you talking about? What are you doing? -Deena, no! -Go on. Feel it right here. No way! Why me? There's a lump. It's hard here. -Why me? Get a doctor! Not me! -But I'm scared! Paolo said there's something hard here. What? Wait, who's Paolo? Why was he feeling up your breast? My God, do I have to explain why he was feeling up my breasts? He's my new boyfriend. Of course he'd feel them up. -Come on, Mariel. -No way! Deena, no way! My grandmother died of breast cancer. And I lost my Dad to colon cancer. I'm seriously scared. Help me, please. You're just going to feel it. See if there's a lump or hard mass. Hold still. Wait. There's something hard. It's hard here. Wait. No. We're going to the doctor. Whatever it is, we'll find a way to deal with it. All right. Come on. Get dressed. Hurry! - Raise your arm. - Okay. Mariel. Okay, let's check. Doc, it's by the side. -That's where we felt it. -This one. Here? Yes. That's just your ribs. -Ribs? -You're sure? It's not a lump? So far, none. But the good thing is you had it checked. Oh, my, thank you! Can I also get a pregnancy test while I'm here? Just to be sure. 'Cause I'm late. Hey, you're pregnant? I hope not. What if you are? Then you'll be the godmother! Good thing you convinced me to see a doctor. Or else I would've gone crazy with worry... that I'd lose Chestina and Chabelina. Oh, my gosh, my babies! I love you so much. Don't leave me. -Don't die. -They have names! Really? Of course! Even the child I thought I was bearing already had a name. - My imaginary godchild? - Yes. Mareena! Mariel plus Deena. Mareena! Insane! Hey, I'm serious! Can you let your heart rest for a bit? Don't make it so easy for them. Don't be so easy to get. I don't want to be so hard-to-reach and unattainable like you. I have no plans of ending up alone. -I couldn't do that. -Well! I don't have plans of... Don't you dare come back! You jerk! -Mom! -Mom! You have no one to come home to! -Mom, wait! What's happening? -Mom. Papa's mistress emptied Mom's joint bank account with Dad. Your Dad is something, huh? I had hoped he would change. You really hoped, huh? Yes, I really did. I was thinking Aunt Janice would be happy... if she and your Dad got back together. -You'd all be together again. -One big, happy family... Here's what we'll do. Let's use my Mom's credit card. Let's withdraw some cash. So you have something for your needs here. It's okay. Thank you. Hey, it's going to be okay. Let it all out. My Mom is so weak. She keeps taking him back. How dumb. If he doesn't want to be with us, then fine. He can go to his mistress. We don't need him. To hell with him! You can do this. And I'm going to help you. We can do this, right? Yes! Let's give a round of applause for Hotdog and Bun. Thank you so much! Nice one! I could have gotten a thousand pesos by tutoring. Mariel, what's 1,000... compared to the 10,000 we'll win for best costume? Let's call them by the name Mars and Deens! Let's give them a hand. Oh, wow! How unique! Their costume's incredibly unique! Actually, I was trying to figure it out. What are you two supposed to be? Why are you inseparable? We happen to be the happiest and most beautiful... part of my life. Which, thanks to God and science, are still part of my beautiful body. Ladies and gentlemen... Chestina and Chabelina! My boobies! I thought we were steamed buns! It's more fun to be breasts, Mamee! Hey! We're still in theme. We're the winner! You're really crazy! You should've told me what we were. If I had, then you never would've worn it. Then we wouldn't win. By the way, how much did you spend for this? -We can deduct it... -Forget it. Take it. It's all yours. No! Don't. Mariel. Your family needs it. And your family is my family. Thank you so much. Hey, you! Come here. You're so over-dramatic. It's beautiful here. Let's dance! Come on. Hi, girls. I just wanted to say that you were incredible. And you are awesome. You bet! Mariel and I really are awesome. Didn't you guys already meet at the library? Do you remember? -Of course. -He remembers! But I forgot your name. -What was it again? -Deena. Deena. -Deena, I'm Luke. -Hi. You want to dance? Go. It's okay. You guys enjoy. Sorry, but you can't keep Chabelina apart from Chestina. Sorry. Okay. But if you change your mind, I'll just be over there. Why didn't you dance with him? He's a catch. You look good together. Mariel. Girl code. What is Chestina's is Chestina's. And what is Chabelina's is only Chabelina's. Hey. A guy will never come between us. Nothing. Nothing can come between us. Stop it! How sweet! Come on, let's dance. Let's go, Mamee! Deena! We made bold promises that nothing would break us. We could do it all. We will help each other. We will save each other from sadness. But promises have their limits. Everything has its limits. Even our friendship. Mariel! You said I'd only wait for 30 minutes. I've been here for over an hour! Deena, sorry. I really need to finish this. If you take any longer, we won't catch that jerk anymore. Deena, I might not catch Justin Saavedra anymore if... Who? Come on, already! Get down here! Let's go! Deena, you have to understand that millions are at stake here. And I don't want to disappoint my team. We might not get bonuses if... What are you saying? Your job is more important than me, is that it? Deena, that's not what I meant. Are you coming with me or not? Deena, don't be like that. If you don't want to come with me, I'm going on my own! Just leave me alone! He just had some bruises and scrapes. There are no broken bones or concussion. He can go once the bill has been settled. -Thank you, Doctor. -All right. Excuse me, please. Are you really okay, Lito? I'm okay, Ma'am. Just look after your friend. She looks really drunk. Mamee... Is he all right? I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. Please talk to me. Is there a problem? A lot. This is the second time you went to my office drunk, and now that somebody got hurt, you're banned from returning. Our HR manager will investigate the case. They will determine if I let you in to the office... knowing you were drunk, because if I had prior knowledge that you were... that's a violation of office decorum, grounds for suspension. I'm sorry. I'm sorry if I bothered you. I really didn't mean to... That's always your excuse. When are you going to take things seriously? I really don't know what to do with you. Paging Doctor Sanchez. Please proceed to the ER. Doctor Sanchez, to the ER please. Your shift is about to start. You better get ready. You'll be late. I resigned from my job. What? When? Why? Yesterday. Working in a call center is dumb. -What are you going to do? -I don't know! Do I need to have a plan right away? I'm not a slave to my work like you are! Wow! I'm sorry, but I have siblings to feed and send to school. I don't have a mother to pay for all my needs like you do. You're so used to being selfish. Sorry, I didn't mean that. I was just... That didn't come out right. I'm sorry. The truth finally came out. You know, don't worry. I won't be your problem anymore. I'll pay the bill. -Deena... -And I'm not angry. It's okay. You didn't say anything wrong. Deena... It just hurts to hear that that's what you think of me. Deena, it's not like that. I'm sorry. Don't apologize because there's nothing wrong with what you said. This is me. You're right. I need to fix myself. I need to fix my life. I just don't know how. But I'll figure it out, promise. (NORWAY 2012) Deena... -Deena. -Yes? -Mr Johansson needs you. -Okay. Okay. Okay. Here. Just turn around. So how did you get into underwater photography? Actually, I just discovered it by accident. Someone told me that... Someone told you what? Justin, someone said what? Somebody told me that I should pursue underwater photography. She said that I have an eye for beauty. You know, I agree! Maybe you can go dive with me later? -Later? -Yes. You know what? I already have a dive date tonight. I'm sorry. Excuse me. Hey, love. Congratulations, love! Wow! First place. I'm so proud of you! No, congrats to you! If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't be here. If you didn't believe in me. So, let's celebrate? -Come on! -No. I have to go. -What? You just got here. -I'm sorry. I know... -Let's stay the night, please. -I really have to go. Come on. Just this once. I won. It's time to celebrate. Come on. Please? Fine. Okay. Yeah! -No! No! No! -All right! No, no! Stop it! - Let's swim! - No! Let me go! Do I really need to say that? Maybe I can say that we've had a great year. And that Saavedra Food Corp is still the market leader until today. You know, if I were one of your stockholders... I'd want to get a clear picture of where the company is. Mom? We're here. -Alfred? -Auntie! -Come on. -Good evening. Good evening. How are you? -Where are the boys? -Sit. I'll call your brothers. - Alfred! - Are you okay now? - Mark! TJ! - You know, I realized... -It's time to eat, boys! -You're right. It's best to be honest and just tell them all the details. Hey... Thanks for helping me out. -Mariel! Justin! -Hey! -Beer? -This early? Oh, sorry. Can you drink? -TJ, let's eat! -Technically, I can. -But I'll just have water. -Okay. -That will be your last bottle. -Save that for later. Let's eat! -Good evening, Justin! -This is quite a feast, Auntie. -Let's all eat together, okay? -Thank you, Auntie! You guys deserve it. Congratulations on your win. - Thank you. - And congrats, Mariel on your promotion. Congrats, Mariel. - Congrats, Justin. - Congratulations! Let's take a selfie before we eat! -Look there. -One, two... -Deena, let's go. -All right. - Are the reports okay? - Yes, they are. Good thing Mariel helped me with this presentation. I should thank her. Also, your work has improved greatly in the last two years... since you two got together. Honestly, Bene... I don't know what I'll do without her. Marry her. Justin. Babe... I am so proud of your report up there. Didn't I always tell you that you had it in you? Mom, it's called "The Mariel Effect." What are you saying? Mom, this is all Mariel. She's been helping me with this report for the past few days. Even if she is busy with her own job, she still prioritized me. Whatever. For my birthday dinner this Sunday, family only. Okay, Mom. Whatever you say. -Happy birthday! -Thank you. Love, are you sure it's okay that I'm here? Yes, I am a hundred percent sure. Bene! Justin... -Hi. -Hi, Mariel. -I've been waiting for you. -What's wrong, Mom? I said family only. Mom, she might be family someday. Go, say hi. They are on their way. Mom, give her a chance, okay? Smile, please. Happy birthday, Mom! Hi, Cara. Hi, Auntie. From Mariel. Happy birthday, Auntie. Justin said you enjoyed the carrot cake I baked before. Yes. That was really good. Thank you. It didn't taste like my recipe. And it was kind of dry. And it wasn't sweet enough. But, thank you. Well? I'm hungry. Let's go! Okay, Mom. By the way, Justin, did Cara tell you? We saw Rachel in New York. Wait. Rachel one or Rachel two? Two. Benitez. Too bad! Justin let her go, and she was perfect for him. Mom. Oh, Mariel, sorry. No offense meant. None taken. Trust me. Rachel was far from perfect. You know who's perfect for me? Mariel. Come here. Justin? I love you. What are you doing? I know this might come off as unplanned or sudden. - But... - What? this is the right time for me. Mariel... will you marry me? Yes. Hi. Thank you for coming. You want anything? Maybe... -Waiter, excuse me. -Don't bother. Let's cut the crap. What is your agenda? Auntie, Justin and I are getting married. I just thought that... Maybe... I should make an effort to get to know you. And maybe you'd want to get to know me too. I think I know you enough. And I think I know why you want to be with my son... despite the fact that he was an alcoholic, and he was in rehab. But you... It does not bother you, not even a tiny bit. Auntie, I know what Justin went through. I know that that's part of his past. And I know that he's changed. And that he's constantly trying his best to be a better man now. I love Justin. -I love him and I have no... -Please. Please. Love? You love my son... because of his money. Okay. If you think I'm only after his money... then I could sign a pre-nup. We won't get married until you're comfortable with the fact. Did you assume there would be no pre-nup? Michelle? Excuse me. - Get my attorney. - Okay, Ma'am. Don't you want to know the terms? No. Although, I want to know... did I say anything... wrong or did something... Did I show you something that made you hate me this much? I don't... I don't know why. I just... I don't like you. Oh, my God! You're getting married! Hold on. Didn't you say you weren't okay with his family? That you couldn't fit in because of Madame Bitch Highness. And now, you said "yes" just like that? Well, I love him. Really, Mariel Salvador? -Is that you? -It's just... Maybe... I just need to learn to get along with his mother. She better thank the heavens I'm not there now. Because if I'd been there every time she snubbed you, I would've gotten into a fight with Madame Bitch Highness. Come on! Stop that. But hey, can you come home for the wedding? - Because if you can't... - Of course! I'll be there. You're only getting married once! Really? Love. -Goodbye, Sir. -Wait. Justin is here. -Sorry to keep you waiting. -Love, it's Deena. It's okay. It's okay, love. - How lewd! - Our meeting was a hassle. -It's okay. It's Deena. -Sorry. - Hey, Deena! - Hi! Hi, best friend-in-law! Finally, we're meeting next year! Yes! I'm so excited to finally meet you in person. Hey. Are you ready for our wedding? By the way, your plane ticket's on us, okay? No! Don't bother. I can manage. I'll pay for it. Of course, I want to be the best maid of honor ever! There's already so many people. Mariel. Deena's flight landed early this morning. -She's not going to make it. -No. No. I talked to her, she's at the Oslo airport. - Let's wait. Can't we wait... - Well... I don't care if your good-for-nothing maid of honor is here or not! We have to start now! All my VIP guests are already here. Okay, fine. You're an embarrassment! - Let me go first. - Let's start! - Okay. - Now! Okay. I'll go instead, okay? I'll be your maid of honor. Go! Let's start! - Everyone, get inside! - You know, I could strangle - your soon-to-be mother-in-law. - Go inside, everyone! Why do you let her treat you like that? This is your day! Besides, you didn't ask her a single cent for this wedding. Mom, that's enough. This is our choice. Please don't add more stress. Please, stop. And now, the part most awaited by our single ladies! Let's call on all the single ladies! - The bridesmaids! - Yeah! - Single relatives! - Let's go! I want to join too! -Here it is! Ready? -All right. Let's go! - We are ready! - Okay. Game. One! One... -Two! -Two... Mamee! Oh, my God! Is that Deena? The maid of honor has finally arrived! - Hi! - It is Deena. I got detained at the London airport... because I didn't look like my passport picture. -I'm sorry if I'm late, Mariel. -No! It's okay! I'm just happy you're here! -Who's that? -Mariel's best friend. - Wait a minute. - Okay, okay! Time for your speech, girl! -Thank you. -Get back to your seats, girls! Hi! Hello! I'm the real maid of honor. -Sarah, hold my bag! -Okay. I got you! I'm sorry. I'm late. But, you know what they say... It's better late than never, right? I won't speak in English anymore. This event is too important... for my bad English skills. I'd just ruin it. Mamee... I'm so happy for you, girl! You're married! Now you have someone who'll love you for the rest of your life. Congratulations! Justin, congratulations because Mariel loves you! You're very lucky. I know because that's exactly how I feel... because she loves me too. She loved me even when it was unbearable to love me. She didn't give up on me, especially on our friendship. Because of her, I got my act together. Thank you for everything, Mamee! Everyone deserves a Mariel in their life. Everyone needs a Mariel. And everyone should have a Deena. Everyone deserves a Deena. You deserve this, Mamee! Wow! This is so soon! Wait a minute, the guy who got the garter might be ugly. If he is, forget it. Yeah! He is so handsome! I'm Deena. And you are? Very much single. Really? Me too. What a coincidence, right? Come here! Let's take a picture! The four of us. Hi! Can I have a kiss? I came from Europe. Hi! Come. Picture! Smile! -Bye. Congrats! -Thank you. -Thank you. -Hey. Let's just text when Pochoy arrives from Dubai. -You're right! -All right. Keep in touch. Make sure you're available that day, okay? Okay. Thank you, Sarah. - Take care, Sarah! - Take care! Hey, Mamee, let's go to the karaoke bar... -Hey! I'd love to! -after the honeymoon. It's a must! And there should be steamed pork buns! Game on! Mamee. I really missed you. Me too. Come over here. Love. Love. Uncle Russell is leaving. -I'll just say goodbye. -Go on. Go ahead. -It'll be quick. -I'll just be here. Yes. I am aware of that. Yeah, just make sure Hunter agrees... on the board seat. Okay. So I'll see you in Chicago. Thanks, Charles. -You're alone... -It's your brother's wedding... Sorry. You were saying? It's your brother's wedding but you're still working. You're the boss. You can tell them not to disturb you. Well, if it were only me, my time, and my life. But a lot of people depend on me for their living. I can't just tell them not to disturb me. You know. Why? What's with the smile? You're like Mariel. Serious. Responsible. Just taller and with a mustache. Are you okay? I just realized that Justin is Mariel's best friend now. I just hope I still have a place in her life. I can't just trouble her any time of the day... now that she's married, right? Well, you can trouble someone else then. Who? You? Why not? -Hey, we're here! -Honeymooners are back. Hey, Mom. Hello. -Bene! -How was it? It was great! It was great! Hi, Auntie. You can call her Mom already. Right, Mom? She's officially part of the family. Sure. Whatever. Oh, how was Europe? -We got you a present. -Here it is. Mariel kept reminding me... that we should buy you the rosary from the Vatican. A rosary. Because I need to be nicer? - Mom, that's a nice gift. - Come on, Mom. I thought you'd like it. Okay. Thank you. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hi! Welcome back! Welcome back! How was your honeymoon? Why are you here? What are you doing here? -Because she's my girlfriend. -Whoa! So what? Let's have lunch. I've prepared a feast for you. -For me? -Yes, for you, darling. Because I like you. You're too sweet, Mommy Helen. No, you're sweet. Come on. Let's eat! Come on. -Let's go. -Let's go, Justin. -Bene. -Wait a second. So, what's up? Tell me all about your honeymoon. -You look fresh. -No, what's up with you? You didn't even clue me in. What's going on? It just happened after your wedding. Mamee, I think this is destiny. So, what's your plan? You're flying back to Norway next week. Is it going to be a long-distance relationship? I'm not going back to Norway. I'm staying here for good. What? Have you thought about this? What's your plan? Nothing. All I know is I want to be with Bene. Are you sure about this? Because... this is Bene we're talking about. Yeah... So? I just meant... He's my family now and I just don't want anyone to get hurt. And you know how Madame is like. You mean Mommy Helen? She's so nice! She's fun to be with. She's not the snob you painted her out to be. Well, you didn't see how she treated me. Maybe you're just too sensitive. And just don't mind her. Wait a second. Why does it seem like... you don't want me to be part of this family? Are you ashamed of me? Of course not. Deens, come on. It's not like that. Well, that's how it seems to me, Mariel. I'm sorry. It's really not like that. Sorry. Deena! Let's eat. Sit here beside me. Stop worrying about Deena. But, love, I told you how she is when she gets hurt. You know that. But she's better now. And if she's not, well, Bene is a fixer. That's why they say he's the better Saavedra son. Of course not. That's not true. -It's true. -No. He's better at business. He's intelligent. And he's more good-looking than me. Fishing. That's not true. But seriously... If Bene's life becomes better because of Deena then why not? I know. I just want Deena to be happy. As I want Bene to be happy too. But... I just think they're moving too fast. That's really how Deena is but still... But they kind of have to. Bene is getting old. Hey. Can we stop talking about them? Let's focus on us. Welcome to the family, Deena. Finally, Bene will have other things to do than work. He works too much... I love this guy. -I love you. -Love you. Really? How much? Sorry, I have to take this call. Hunter. Guam. Let's go. What did I just say? I'm training you. Let's go. - Hello. - Excuse us. Are you okay? Yes. I just need to get used to the fact that I'm marrying a busy man. He has so many responsibilities. Wow. You've changed. You think I'm still that same clingy and demanding Deena? No. It's funny. You used to beg my Mom to adopt you just so we'd become sisters. And now... You're actually going to be my sister. I know, right? Are you okay with that? Of course. Deens, I'm so happy for you. Me too. I'm really happy for myself too. Let's start planning the wedding. Should I call my wedding coordinators or... No, don't trouble yourself. Mommy Helen recommended someone whom she said was better... Okay. But if you need anything, just tell me, okay? Hey, let's toast to that. -But it has to be wine. Wait. -Oh, no. -Waiter. -I can't, I can't drink. Why? My period's late. I could be pregnant. Oh, my God! Mariel! -You're going to have a baby! -Okay. We're not sure yet. No. Let's claim it! You're pregnant. I'm going to be an Auntie. And you, Mamee, you'll be a mommy! Hi, baby! Excited to meet you. -You can wait there, Ma'am. -Thank you. Hi, Mom. Hi. You need to wear loose clothing. You're pregnant, right? Huh? Deena told me yesterday. Why didn't you tell me? Because I'm not pregnant. I just told Deena that maybe, maybe I could be pregnant. But then I, I got my period. So... -So, you're not pregnant? -Not yet. Okay. I misunderstood. I know you don't like me. But you know, Mariel, I would like very much to be involved... in the future of my grandchildren. I want to make sure that they are raised in the best way possible. If you know what I mean. Hi, Mom! Mamee. All I said was you might be pregnant. But that wasn't how she understood it. It's okay, Deena. Let's not talk about it. It's done anyway. Next time, wait 'til I say something first. Hey! Mariel, I said I was sorry. I'm really sorry. It's okay. The wedding coordinators will be here any minute. Don't be like that. I just wanted to help you get on her good side. She feels you're a bit full of yourself. And she says it's as if you're always competing with her. What? She said it's like you're out to prove you're better than her. Where did that come from? And what, you've been talking about me behind my back? No. Come on. I just mentioned to her how much I admire you both... because you have a lot of traits in common. No, we don't. Do you think I'm horrible, too? Hey, Mommy Helen is actually nice. To you. Not to me. Deena, come on. It's as if you've never heard of how she mistreated me before. Remember, you even wanted to slap her for me? Well, that was before. I didn't know her side of the story. All I knew was yours. Mm, so you're siding with her now? No. I've actually been defending you. No matter how much you try to defend me, it's no use. She really has it in for me. Just try to win Mommy Helen over. You think I haven't tried? My God, Deena! I've tried everything. But I'm still a villain in her eyes. -Mams... -Maybe you, too. Maybe you also think of me as a villain. Huh? The coordinators are here. Thank you. Wow. This seems even grander than your wedding. This already feels like the reception. And, oh, my God! 800 guests? You had less than half that, right? Of course. Bene's partners alone take up so many seats. And Justin and I really wanted an intimate wedding. Are you two okay? Of course! Oh, okay. I just thought something's up between you two. Hold on. Mariel! Let's take a picture. We don't have one yet. Please. - Wait. Can I... -Come on. I'll have your makeup retouched first. Am I oily already? - Yes, but it's okay. - I feel like I'm sweating. Ms Deena, from Ms Helen. Oh, my God! "Deena, darling. I'm so happy you're going to be my daughter." "Love, Mommy Helen." Oh, my God. Mommy Helen's so sweet. Oh, my God! Mamee, it's so pretty! I'll just wear this! Help me take this off. My God. I think I know who won the favorite daughter-in-law contest. We're not competing. This is better, right? Yeah. It's pretty. Come on. Let's take a picture. Game! Don't forget our meeting... -Hey. I have to go. -Come on, love. I'll call you back. Enjoy your honeymoon. Bye. Five pregnancy kits can't all be wrong, right? You're gonna be a Mom. And you're gonna be a Dad. Wait! Mommy Helen isn't here yet. -Just wait. -You ruined it. -Sit first. -What about me? Only the pregnant women can stay. I'll show you my photos, the underwater photos. Justin, let me see your photos. -Mm! It's really good. -Diving photos. -Was this last weekend? -Yeah. The best! Your culinary classes have really paid off. You've been busy with the beach. - I'm still editing... - It's so delicious! Why don't you put up a resto? -Huh? -Yeah. -Could I do it? -Of course! Maybe I could. But you have to join me. We should be partners. Okay. Then we'll have a buy one, get one promo on steamed pork buns. Yes! Then we'll name the place Chestina and Chabelina! -Yeah! -That's a winner. For sure. Perfect timing. People can try your food at our reunion this Saturday. We'll automatically get clients. What do you think? Actually... I, I have... Hey, Deens! You already confirmed. I have a culinary class. You go ahead, Mamee. You can handle it. Deens, I didn't want to go in the first place. You just forced me, remember? Hello! Hello, everybody. - Hi, Mom! - Sorry, I'm late. -Traffic was horrendous. -Good afternoon. -Hello. Hello. -Hey, Mom! Hello. - Hi, Mom. - Hello. Look at the sonogram. Show it to Mom. - Yeah. - I haven't seen this one. When will I see little Benes, little Justins, -little Cara, little Drew... -Soon! and of course, my little Deenas. Mini Mariels. We also need mini Mariels. - Yeah. - Everybody needs mini Mariels. Sweetheart. Don't forget, okay? The fund-raising event. We have to meet this coming Saturday. All my friends are excited to meet you! Oh, yeah, the fundraiser. That's a big deal. Mom, is that the yearly fundraiser? I'm sure Mariel would be happy to help also. Ah, no. She's pregnant and I don't want to stress her. And I think Deena and I can handle it, right? Mom, you should taste that chicken cordon bleu. This is really, really good. You have other pictures of the sonogram? - Deena made it. - Yeah. We believed nothing would change. We thought we wouldn't change. So even if it was hard, we didn't want to let go of our old promises. We couldn't accept the truth. And we forced ourselves to revive what was already lost. (Mamee. Steamed pork buns after my meeting?) What's wrong? Nothing. Sorry, Mom. It's Mariel. I've been having a hard time talking to her lately. Your friend has always been difficult to talk to. Mom. She's going through something. Yeah. But you have to move on. That's true. I really hope she gets better soon. I don't want our restaurant plans to go to waste. She seems to have lost interest. I can be your partner. I'll do it. What? Well, I've always loved your cooking. And, I believe in you, darling. Have you eaten? Are you hungry? I miss you. Let's eat. -Love. -We have an early day tomorrow. Justin? Justin! Hey! Can you show me your photos? -Come on. Show me. -Yeah. Sure. Oh, so this is it? It's amazing. By the way, I'm staying here the whole weekend. You? Are you sure nothing happened between you and that slutty woman? Nothing happened. I swear. You better be sure. If you cheat on my friend, I'll take you on. Remember that. I would never do that. It's just that... I don't know what to do anymore. I've done everything. I told her we should go to the beach for a vacation, spend quality time, but she refused. It's almost like... she doesn't want to be alone with me. You know, I've no idea what's going on with Mariel anymore. Don't worry, I'll talk to her. Hi, babe. Hi, babe. Oh, what happened? Nothing. It's just Mariel... I know. Let's go get something to eat. Then we'll talk about it. -Come on. -Let's go. I missed this, Mamee. We haven't done this in a while. By the way, I've got news for you, Mamee. Did you know we already received donations for the event? So we were able to raise funds immediately. Cool, right? You know, I've been going on and on here... yet you haven't said a word. You haven't even touched the steamed pork buns I brought. Sorry. Sorry. What's the problem? Is it work? Justin? Me? I talked with my doctor. Apparently, I'm going to have trouble conceiving. Mariel... You know there are other options. You can adopt. It's not that easy. You won't understand me. Yeah, I don't always understand. I'm trying my best to understand but I have my limits too. Sorry. I will understand you. I'm sorry, too. I can't... Things are just so hard. I can't... I can't understand. I can't explain. I can't even share about it. You can't because you won't even try. The problem is, you always keep things to yourself. Mariel, I'm here. Wretched traffic. It took me two hours. -Hi, Mom. -Hello, Deena. Mariel. I brought steamed pork buns. Have you eaten yet? Later. I really need to pee. Your seat is over here. So how are you? Thank you for coming. Your seat is here. I just learned about the financial report. Our sales have been dismal this quarter. Anyway, let's just discuss it tomorrow. Babe, I'll introduce you to Mr and Mrs Chiu. Justin, where are you? Ma'am, wine? He's used to that. Thank you. Don't worry, he's used to all my quirks. Have you eaten... It's Mariel. Wait, I'll just go to her. Mariel. You're here. I didn't think you could make it. I never said that I couldn't. And of course, I want to support your event. Thank you. Let's just enjoy ourselves, okay? Let's be happy. Maybe you'd like to put on a big smile. You look like you were forced to come here. Sorry, am I ruining your mood? -Sorry. -No. That's not what I said. Have you eaten yet? Oh, waiter, waiter, over here. Serve her first please. Here. Try it. Go. How is it? Is it good? Everything's still on trial run. But Mom said she'd help me build my dream restaurant. Your restaurant? You have a different partner now? I wasn't sure if you were still interested. We never got a chance to talk about it again. And it felt like you weren't into it anymore. I lost my baby. Naturally, I'd lose interest in everything else. Deena, what did you expect? Well, if you still want to, then let's be partners. We can still do that. No. Never mind. You and Madam look happy together anyway. Oh, my God. Hey, hey, hey! Good evening, everyone! I just want to thank everyone for coming to our humble event tonight. To all our sponsors who supported Good Women Foundation, thank you to each one. To keep us all in high spirits, it's time for some entertainment. I have a small surprise for you. But don't be too shocked, okay? I really went all out for this event. Hey, are you okay? Have you eaten yet? Take it easy. One, two, three! Maybe you'd like to sing, Mom? Now we can all sing and enjoy. But happy songs only, okay? All of the proceeds from your donations will benefit the mothers and children... supported by Good Women Foundation. It's five thousand pesos. -Got it? -Got it! And because of that, let me be the first to break the ice. Babe, I want to sing. Make a donation. Fifty thousand, just to hear my wife sing. OMG! But before I sing, there's someone I have to do a duet with here in front. She's the one who really believed in me... and became my partner in crime. She supported me to become who I am now. Which is why I love her so much. It's none other than Mommy Helen! Come on, Mom! Let's sing, Mom! Come on, Mom! - You'll be fine, Mom. - Game. I can't. Just sing along with me, Mom. You can do it. - Oh, no, I can't do it. - Come on, Mom. - I can't. No, I can't. - You can do it, Mom. - Go, Mom! - Go, Mom! - Let's just enjoy. - I don't know how. I'm not good at this. Me, me, me! I know this song. Love. Come on! ♪Are you feeling depressed?♪ ♪Seething with hatred?♪ ♪Resentful towards the world?♪ -What are you doing? -Why? Aren't you all happy? I want to be happy. Me too. I want to be happy too. You're all so happy here, right? Let me join you! This is my favorite part. ♪Hey! My friend, listen to...♪ Love. No! No! No! No! I'm singing. Love, enough. Let's go home. Love. Sorry, sorry. Excuse me please. If you're going to make a mess, you shouldn't have come. Why are you throwing a tantrum? -Sorry. Sorry. -Why are you getting wasted? Sorry, I don't know why I did that. Sorry. Sorry. Drop the good girl act. Be honest for once. I already said I'm sorry! Sorry! Why are you angry? Because Mommy Helen is my new partner in the restaurant? -You're so petty! -Wow! So now I'm the petty one? You're petty 'cause you think that's the only reason I'm angry. So it's not just that? So why are you angry? Don't turn your back on me! You're so rude! I worked on this for months. My God! And then this is what you do? You're just going to ruin this? Did I ever bother you for help? You couldn't be inconvenienced! I had a miscarriage. Yes, you had a miscarriage. So does that mean our lives should be put on hold, too? It's been months. You refuse to move on. I am moving on. I'm here to support you! Happy? Really? Thank you! I feel so loved. -Don't be sarcastic. -Then don't be plastic! Admit it. You got pissed off when you found out... Mommy Helen would be my new business partner. Fine! Yes, I am angry. -You're jealous! -I am! Finally! The truth! But it's not what you're thinking! I'm jealous because you're friends with her! What about me? I'm left out. I lost my friend. You know why? You're different now! You changed! Isn't that what you wanted? For me to change? You repeatedly made me feel so awful about myself. That's why I fixed myself! I bettered myself! And now you can't be happy for me? And why? Because I was able to do that all on my own! Without you! You're wrong. Wow! So I'm wrong again! Because you're always right. Because you're always above all of us. In your eyes, we're all wrong, we're all imperfect, we're all failures! And you're the good one! You're the smart one! You're the one who always helps me! I do that because I love you. And I want you to be happy. That's not true! You do that for yourself, so you're the hero! So you feel like you're the good friend! And I'm just the crazy friend who always... falls victim to her own stupidity! That's why you don't want me to be part of this family! -That's not true, Deena. -It is true! You're ashamed of me! Because you think I'm the problem you constantly need to fix! That I will ruin your perfect life! -You're out of line! -Ever since I got married, you're the one who changed. I stopped being your friend. I stopped being your sister. You started treating me like your enemy and your competition! You left me to swim on my own, and I did! Because I was hoping you'd be proud of me. But you couldn't be happy for me. You know why? Because you can't stomach the fact that I am your equal. That I can surpass you. You want to believe that? Go ahead! -Because that's the truth! -To you! Not mine! All I know is what's true for me, Deena! And I don't feel bad that you surpassed me, or that you're better than me. I'm angry, I'm sad, I'm hurt... because I lost my best friend who had my back. Since you came back, you weren't the friend who always believed in me. Who preferred my company over that of others. What's worse is I lost my friend when I truly need her now. I really want to be happy for you, Deena. But it's so difficult... because I don't know how to be happy anymore. And yes, I envy you. Not because you were able to fix your life, but because I can't fix mine. Mariel... I want you to pull me up, I want to beg for your help. But I'm so ashamed. Because why would I ask that of you? Why should you fix me? I should be the one fixing myself. After all... -You did it all on your own. -Mariel... Now I know... You don't want to help carry my burdens. Mariel... I won't ask anything more from you. Mariel... Mariel. -Mariel, please. -Please, no. -Mariel, please. Mariel! -I need to be alone, please. Come on Justin, tell me. What's wrong? I'm sorry, Bene. But I can't do this anymore. Justin, look... As your brother, as your friend, I would understand and say, go follow your heart. But as chairman of the Saavedra Group of Companies, no. How do you expect me to manage all these companies on my own? Justin, I need you. Take a rest. Take a few weeks off. A month. Or more, if you need more time. I'll take care of the investors' meeting in China. But you can't just quit. Please. Babe, I tried to convince Justin but he won't change his mind. I can't move the meeting. We might lose out to our competitors. Babe. Babe, babe. Come on, babe. Babe. Come here. I'm sorry. I know I promised to be with you on our anniversary. But I really, really have to do this. I can still make it to our anniversary dinner. Don't be mad. -I love you. -Babe, you promised. I know you're incredibly busy. I get that. I've accepted that part of you. You can be busy all year. Work every single day. But this is all I ask. One day. Just let me have this one day. Babe... I promise, you won't be alone tomorrow on our anniversary. -You promise? -Don't get mad. Why didn't you tell me? If I told you, you would've stopped me. You would've forced me to find a reason to stay in that job. Even though I'm not happy anymore. Okay. You're not happy. Okay, I understand that. What's your plan then? I'll focus on my photography. Yes, I won't earn much at first, but once I start making a name for myself... Wait. Are you angry... because you're concerned about the money? Oh, my God, Justin! That's what you think of me? This isn't about money! You're afraid that I won't be able to provide for you? That we're going to end up broke, is that it? I'm not new to poverty, Justin. That's where I came from. I can go back to being poor. I can endure, but that's not the point. Then what's the point? What's so wrong that I followed my heart... and I want to do something that I'm passionate about? -So finally, I can be happy! -Exactly! You only think of your own happiness. You only think about yourself! Right? Where am I in that? Where's your wife? You decided without telling me. It's just so unfair! So irresponsible! It's a good thing we don't have a child. You blame me, don't you? I never wanted to lose our baby. If I only knew there'd be a storm and we would've been stranded, then go ahead and blame me. But I didn't want us to get stranded there... We wouldn't have been stranded on that island... if you didn't want to stay longer. I wanted... I wanted to go home. But you? You still wanted to dive. But you said it was okay. Because you said you wouldn't take long! But you went on your word! For what? Because you were happy? You were having fun? You forgot that you had... You had a pregnant wife waiting for you. And you're at it again, Justin. You left me out, your wife, on your decision. (Deena, Justin and I have a problem.) (Deena, I'm sorry...) -Hello? -Hello, babe? I'm so sorry, my flight got delayed. So, I'll celebrate our anniversary by myself. No, no, no. Don't worry. I'll charter a private jet. I'll be late, but I promise you, I'll be there. Forget it. It's fine. Don't come home anymore. Babe. Hi, Mom! Come inside. -Oh, I guess I'll just go. -What? Hello, Mom? Mom, I can't understand you. -I'll come back some other time. -Deena! Deena! It's Bene. His plane crashed. He's gone. -He's gone. -What? Sorry, I'm sorry. - I'm here for you. - No! Don't! Oh, no! It can't be! No! Oh, my God! -No, no, no. -No, no. Deena! Deena! Yes, Mom, I didn't really know. I just had a hunch. Justin's coming. I'll just update you. Mariel! Paging Dr Garcia. Delivery room, please. -Are you okay? -Excuse me. -Who brought in Deena Saavedra? -I did. I'm her sister-in-law. She's fine now. It's a good thing that she was in the water for only a short time. There's no head trauma or any other injuries. So, she's going to be fine? Physically, yes. But we need to monitor her closely, and she needs to be evaluated by a psychiatrist. Is this the first time she attempted to take her life? First time... First time, as far as I know. Was there any recent event that would've led her to do this to herself? Her husband, my brother, died three months ago. Even the employees, whenever they see Bene's empty office, there's an unsettling feeling. Seems like everything's in flux. And it doesn't help that there's a rumor going around... that before Bene died, Justin resigned. You need to move in to your brother's office. Love, are you okay? I can never be Bene. I'll never be as good as him. I'm afraid I'll mess it all up. You can do it. I believe in you. Deens, better eat first. You need to eat something. Deena, please. I brought you some food. Deens... I want to die. Bring these down, please. I'm running late. Hi, love, good morning. Love, don't forget what I said last night. Before you go home and before you go to work, make sure that Deena is okay. I'll be back by Saturday, okay? Ma'am, here's your food. I don't want to eat. You know what, take a vacation. Tell the others as well. - Ma'am? - I want to be alone. Go, just go. Please. What are you doing here? Don't tell me you're trying to kill yourself. It still smells like Bene in here. Have you eaten already? I don't want to. Would you buy me some alcohol? That was two weeks ago, when Mariel went to Singapore. Besides the depression about her husband's death, what did you talk about while you were drinking? My husband doesn't drink anymore. Not anymore. -Doc... -Aunt. - Where's Deena? - She's in a room already. I'll take you there. Excuse me. You know, when we were kids, Bene told me that... he wanted to be reincarnated as a seahorse. The day he died, I saw a seahorse. I'm sorry, Deena. It's my fault! It's my fault! Your fault! I'm sorry. It's your fault! It's your fault! It's your fault! It's your fault! Your fault, your fault. It's all your fault! Sorry. Sorry. It's my fault. If I didn't force him to come home... he'd still be alive. Your big brother would still be alive. Bene... I... I miss you. Bene... Hi. I miss you so much. Deena, we will be referring you to Dr Evalle, our resident psychiatrist. We want to help you get better, for you to stop hurting yourself. Now, we ran some tests and, I think I need to discuss some things with the patient first. What things? What's the matter? Ma'am, I'll discuss it with the patient first. Why? It's okay, Doc. What's the matter? Well, given your age, protocol for us is to conduct certain tests... when you were rushed here earlier. And it appears that you're pregnant. Did you know that you're pregnant? Pregnant? Oh, my God! Though Bene's gone, he's come back through his child. Oh, my God. Lord! You're so good to me, you really love me. Thank you for my baby. You really love me. Thank you for my baby! Thank you, Lord! Oh, my God. Deens? Hi. Hi. How are you? I see you haven't eaten. Here. I brought steamed pork buns. Want to eat? You want to? I hope you get cleared already. Deens, when you get discharged, I'll go to the OB with you. This isn't Bene's. What? I got my period the day Bene died. So I'm sure. What... What happened? I'm a slut. Deens... My husband hasn't even been dead for a year, I already slept around. Deena, no... I was drunk. I haven't had sex for a long time and so I looked for a guy. Three, actually. In one day. So I don't know who the father is. You can tell Mom. So you could be her new favorite. Deens, don't be like that... Leave, Mariel. I don't need your judgment, your condescension. Please, just leave me alone. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm worried about Deena. I don't know how to help her. Your mom... What if she finds out? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Crap. Crap. Crap. Crap. Crap. Crap. It's not an affair, right? I mean, Bene was already dead when she slept with... whoever that was. I mean, you know. So technically, she didn't cheat on Bene. It's not an affair unless it's with a married man. And she will never do that. I mean... Deena, couldn't possibly... I know her. She would never do that. Hey! Justin! What did you do? Why'd you hang up? That could've been important. She might harm herself again. Wait, she might be calling me... Mariel. Why is she calling you? Mariel, please. Justin, don't say anything. Please... - Mariel. - I'm begging you. Mariel doesn't need to know. What happened between us didn't mean anything. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. -You animal! -Mariel. -You animal! -Mariel, I'm sorry! You cheated on me! - You bastard! - I'm sorry. -How dare you! -I'm sorry! You animal! I'm sorry. Mariel. Mariel. Mariel, I'm sorry. Screw you! Don't touch me. You're disgusting! You bastard! Mariel. Mariel. Mariel! You can tell me anything. I'm disgusted with myself. How could I have done such a thing? I'm such a horrible person. I'm so horrible. I deserve to die for what I have done. Mom. Mom, I'm sorry. Mom, I just really need to talk to Mariel. Please. Wait. - Bro, Mom has a machete. - What? Mom, what are you going to do with that? Mom! You bastard! You slept with both my daughters! Sorry. I regret everything. I regret hurting my wife. I don't want to see your face! Or else, I'll chop your penis off! Sorry. - Let go of me! - Mom, I'm sorry. What the heck! Come on. Mariel, you can't leave my son. He needs you. And the baby needs you, too. Deena cannot raise that baby on her own in Norway. But I know you can. Together with Justin. You can raise him as your very own child. As for the pre-nup, forget it. After all... All the pain you've gone through, you deserve it. You deserve everything. You're right. Yes. I deserve everything. Yes, you do. Including a mother-in-law who sincerely cares about me. Who doesn't think I'm a gold digger. Who sincerely believes that I am a good person. You're right. No! You can't leave. Fix my son! You broke him. It's all your fault! Excuse me. It's your fault my son quit his job. Because... Because of your constant rejection. It's your fault that he got back into drinking. Because you were treating him like crap! Even Bene's death is your fault. It's all your fault! You are responsible! It's all your fault! I am done. I'm done with you. I am done being blamed by you. I am done being judged by you. I am done with you. Mariel? Mariel. -Mariel! -Justin? Justin, look! -She slapped me. -Mariel, please! -She slapped me here. -Mom, enough. -I wasn't even doing anything... -Mom, enough! Please! Please, she didn't do anything to hurt you or offend you. So just this once, please respect her. Respect my wife! Mariel. Mariel! Mariel, I'm sorry. Mariel! Mariel, stop it! Mariel! That's enough! You've got some nerve. How long? How long have you been cheating on us? Bene was already dead when... It happened just once. When you went to Singapore. Once? We were both drunk. We were both lonely. And we both regret it. We didn't mean to. That's always been your excuse. You didn't mean to? Your name suits you. Deena. "Dee-not" mean to. "Dee-not" change. "Dee-not" learn. "Dee-not" have any shame. "Dee-not" stop herself from sleeping around. Since day one, you've been a snake. Sneaking around and stealing men. I've never stolen anyone. You know that. I don't know actually. I just chose to believe you because I'm your friend. I don't know. I hope you can still choose to believe me. You want me to believe you? After everything you've done? You've really got some nerve. Hurt me. Shout at me. Curse me. I'll take it all. If it can ease the pain you're feeling. So you can forgive me, Mamee. Don't call me Mamee. Wasn't it enough? Everything I've done for you? Was I a bad friend? What did I ever do to deserve this? You wanted me to lose my husband too so we'd both be miserable? Are you happy now that you've hurt me? I don't want to hurt you because you're my friend. Exactly! You're my friend. Yet you were able to do this to me. You're not my friend. Because if you really are my friend, you know that there are lines that you do not cross. And the moment you slept with my husband... Your husband's brother... You did not just cross the line. You broke it. You have no respect. You destroyed it. Damn you! You threw away everything. You threw away our friendship. And now you want me to tell you it's okay? I understand? I forgive you? I can't forgive you. I don't want to. I just can't. No matter how much I tell myself to forgive you, I just can't do it. Leave. Because I just might kill you. You're out of my life. You are not my friend. You are not my enemy. You are nothing to me. There's no right reason. No acceptable explanation. Even I can't forgive myself. I had to live with that. But not a day passes when I don't hope that maybe one day... (7 years later...) "I need your help"? Dear Auntie Mamee, my name is Mareena. Mom told me you're my godmother. She also told me... that you're the kindest person in the world. On my seventh birthday, my only wish is to come home from Norway. But I didn't tell her that I wanted to meet you. My Mom's sick. The doctor said... she has cancer. But she doesn't want to get treatment. She also doesn't want any help. Help me, Auntie Mamee. I want Mom to be strong again. I don't want a sad Mom anymore. Please come here. Make my Mom smile again. You're my only hope, Auntie Mamee. Love, Mareena. ♪Hold my hand♪ ♪Like you did♪ ♪Before you and I say goodbye♪ ♪We've said From the beginning♪ ♪Our love is everything♪ ♪But now we're left With nothing♪ ♪I just can't leave it All behind♪ ♪How can I turn back the time♪ ♪It won't be easy♪ ♪But it's worth a try♪ Auntie Mamee! ♪'Cause I know♪ Auntie Mamee!

Until I got your daughter's letter. Why don't you want to get chemo? Your daughter's begging. She wants me to convince you to get chemo. I just want to be able to enjoy my last days. And still look pretty. It's okay. I've accepted it. It's punishment for all my mistakes. For everything I've done. For all the lives I've ruined. I'm sorry I hurt you. Sorry I broke you and Justin. And sorry you weren't able to fix things. You're not the only reason we're not together anymore. There were a lot of things we had to work on by ourselves. So don't use us as an excuse not to get treatment. Fight. You have to fight. There you go again. Why won't you just get treatment? Huh? You have to fight! I deserve this. But your daughter doesn't! You think I just gave up? I fought. Again and again. But I lost. It's over. So just accept it. You won't be able to save me like before. You can't. There's nothing to save. There's no more Chestina. No more Chabelina. Like us. There's no more us. Nothing can break us. We broke us. But we can also fix us. Nothing can break us. Your cancer won't break us. I've long been broken. Just let me be. This is my fight. Alone. You don't need to fight alone. I'm here. We'll fight it together. You don't need to be alone. We won't be able to bring Chestina and Chabelina back, but we can bring Mariel and Deena back. I love you, Deena. I love you, Mamee. ♪I just can't leave it All behind♪ ♪How can I turn back the time♪ ♪It won't be easy♪ ♪But it's worth a try♪ ♪I won't give up♪ ♪'Cause I know Love's unbreakable♪ ♪You and I are...♪ ♪Unbreakable♪ ♪Sticks and stones May break our bones♪ ♪But our bond won't be broken♪ ♪We'll overcome And it's just begun♪ ♪Forgive whatever happened♪ ♪Look how far we've come♪ ♪Battles we have won♪ ♪You and I are...♪ Whatever resentment, whatever bitterness, whatever pain we caused each other, I'm choosing to forget.
