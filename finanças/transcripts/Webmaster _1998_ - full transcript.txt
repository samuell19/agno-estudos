TECHNOPOLIS residential zone 4 It took me six months to hack into Stoiss' domain. The largest and most powerful control center in Cyberworld. I thought he'd kill me for it. Instead he gave me a job ... as Webmaster. Now I'm straight. Which suits me fine. I prefer a systematic life. I prefer order. After my morning ritual I go to work at Cyberworld. I maintain Stoiss' domain, making sure everything is in working order. I'm his "virtual janitor". I've rebuilt his system for maximum security. To access all groups, you log on by way of a terabit connection. The speed of the cables allows our Cyber Egos to run in real time. A personal disc is the only key. But if it gets stolen, - - the perpetrator can access your group, account and Cyber Ego. Good morning, JB. Hectic night. 684 level-two inquiries and the connection to Sector 4 is unstable. My Cyber Ego is trained to act on my behalf when I'm not on-line. - Are the others on-line? Rosenstein just logged off after a night on the Japanese stock market. - Transaction way 36 crashed. - Why didn't we prevent it? The virus had an incubation period. I've taken care of it. Give me a domain summary. The domain is a hierarchy of groups. Some hang out with their groups. But most log on to do business. A lot of legal funds are transferred. Stoiss gets his piece, of course. He owns the domain - - and logs in his security code each day. or the system crashes. So Stoiss' well-being is crucial to everyone. No one can access the top group unless they are guests of Stoiss, - R /(o e R A The top group is the safest place in Cyberworld. No one can hack it and upset the balance. Here, our Egos are completely safe. WEBMASTER - How did the implementation go? - Fucking great. Shit, do I have to swear all the fucking time? We'll soon fix the supersemantic errors in your linguistic structure. JB, are you asleep? Nothing's happening. Rosenstein isn't cheating on his wife. I don't like spying on a fellow group member. Relax. The money's good. We could go on a trip. Just the two of us, lazing in the green grass. Sorry, I have to be home in an hour. Right, Miauw? In an hour. I have to fix an unstable code in the domain before Stoiss logs on. I can't play hide-and-seek all night. Miauw. Cut it out, JB. If it weren't for me, you'd never go outside. Miauw is one of the few people I see outside Cyberworld. She's a bounty hunter and a well-paid private detective. I'm just her partner, that's all. She's talked me into helping her. Still, I have time to supervise the training of my Cyber Egos. - Any new experiences? - We've worked with ... "grass.” Whatever it is, it's green. JB, we're working. Are you lost in your little Cyberworld again? Sure. I know "grass”. I had it implemented the other day. JB! Shut down. - Have I seen you before? - How original. How did you get in? All new entries go through me. I have a meeting in two minutes. Sorry, have to log off. - Whose guest are you? - Is your disc write protected? What do you mean? - Are you okay? - Nothing happened. Something's up. Filter the sound so I can hear them. Give me a wave form. Are you taping it? Let's see your face, bitch. Shit! It's your move, JB. They're in apartment 18. - Get me some pictures. There must be a surveillance camera somewhere. Find it! Say you love me. - I've found a camera. - Activate it. - Say you love me! - I love you. I don't believe it! Did you get it on disc? We caught her in the act. We'll get 15,000 for her, easy. She'll exit through the basement. We'll catch her there. - Hi, Miauw. - The Pyke. Aren't you in jail? The Pyke knows Stoiss. Where's JB? Stoiss wants to talk to JB. And then The Pyke wants to talk to Miauw. Okay. He's right over there. Goddamn! - Is this the only exit? - Yes. I've been here before. - All my rich clients live here. - So why not wait for her here? I want to catch her in the act. It'll pay better. 20 grand. They don't even know about it at the station yet. - I'll get 20 grand for that bitch. - I have to be home in 32 minutes. Mind if I catch her first? Fuck, it's a load of money! Anyway, your little Ego's minding the store. - There's no need to badmouth him. - Cut that out. It's my car. - I hate that! - Be neurotic on your own time. Did you remember to change the battery? - I'll just get my kit. - No need. I can fix it. I hustled the janitor. - How well did you know Rosenstein? - I didn't know him socially. - You don't know anyone socially. - Exactly. - It's her. Get her! - Turn the car around. Get in! Great! Just great. Damn! Goddamn it! I could've made at least 25,000 on that killer cunt. Haven't you got any snacks? Or just plain ordinary food? - How can you eat this? - Unlike you I respect my body. Why does shit like this always go down late at night? - What does Stoiss want with you? - I don't really care right now. - Maybe he'll come for you here. - Relax. Nothing is going to happen. - Don't cross off the crackers ... - I have to. Otherwise it'll upset the training of my neural Ego. - You're weird. Let's get going. - In a minute. I didn't know we had that kind of a relationship. - Do we have time for that? - I have to log on in 30 seconds. The mysterious woman in the cyber group worried me. How did she get in? Was she connected to Rosenstein's murder? Was Stoiss on to it? I wasn't half as calm as I led Miauw to believe. - What have you got on her? - I think she's been here before. - Why weren't we aware of it? - She used somebody else's link. We can only see her when she moves into the middle. Bad news. Where did she log on last? - At Rosenstein's. - What? Is that his disc she's got? She's got free access to the group. Are the others on-line? - No. - Let's hope they're watching TV. - Find the murder clip and call TBN. - Shall I fix the back door? Of course. Here's TBN. Didn't it beep? I don't think so. You've called the download department. I've taped a murder in the plutocrat condos. I'm blacked out. Well? - There hasn't been a murder there. - Oh yes, that's the scoop. Name your price. I got it off a surveillance camera. - Where the hell ... - Do you mind? Are you jerking me around? No one can hack a surveillance camera. I can. You have 29 seconds to make up your minds or I'll go to SJP. - JB? - Get yourself another beer. - It's JB! - Do you want the clip or not? - 5,000, tops. - JB, come on! Let's go. I'm shutting down in 20 seconds. Patience. Bl - 8,500. - Let's shake on it. - Thanks. Get dressed. Relax. The power's always unstable at night. - Can you see the bitch clearly? - I need a print. - Let me. E IR that shows her clearly. Fast forward. Ready. - Come on. - We'll be good to you. They say there's only half a million cigarettes left in the world. Stoiss promised to get me half of them. Barbie. My love. - Thanks for the cigarettes, baby. - I've got something for you. Are they for me? I always wear black ... Wear them tonight. Maybe. Damned bitch. Thanks for dropping by. I'm sorry you had to make do with the old prototype. It only just keeps you alive. This one should work better. - I don't know what you're on about. - You should. You're the Webmaster. A stranger entered the domain. I don't yet know what happened. Oh, you don't? It hurts when your heart stops, doesn't it? I'm losing my money and you know nothing. How am I supposed to keep Barbie without money? 180 beats per minute. That ought to get you working at a brisk pace. Even you can't hack this gadget. If you remove it without me, it'll short-circuit your nervous system. I bet that hurts. The battery loses four beats per hour. You have 35 hours. - What do you want from me? - Someone's accessed my account. You've got 35 hours to stop the leak and get my money back. Did you check out your little girlfriend? Once I took Barbie out to dinner. Al the table next to us, - - two men said some things about her that were less than flattering. I cut off their eyelids, so they were forced to watch - - as I peeled their skin off S It takes a long time to die like that. - Rosenstein is dead. - And you were close by. I'd better keep an eye on you. I've moved you to the main building. I want you to see this. I've got your Ego. Unless you complete this task for me, the disc might disappear. 'I do it ... I'll do the job. A "please” would be nice. Please. Stoiss had signed my death warrant. Without my disc I was helpless. 35 hours to stop the leak. Impossible without my Cyber Ego. My Ego was so well-trained that Stoiss could run things without me. So this dump was my new home? How considerate of Stoiss. If this was my end of the deal, how was Miauw doing? I put her out of my mind. I had to get my Ego running. There might be traces of it left on the Net - Are you okay? - Welcome. I'm your cyber waiter. B RN - I'm your cyber waiter. Get going. You ought to take a breath freshener. Hold this. Manual interface. Give me a full report. - Are you high? - Where's JB? - I don't know! - Let him go. - You don't look like bodyguards. - We're from TBN. - JB sold us a ... - Shit! What a fucking mess! - Where is he? - I don't know. No, that we don't know. - I can't use this. What else is there? - Here's a cable diagram. That'll be a big help. Stoiss had his own sense of humor. As if a diagram was any help. The main building was one giant mesh of cables. Only the terabit connections gave access lo the lop group. But you'd think they could at least control them. - No connections in the basement? An unauthorized terabit cable? Vi o R T N R N e e Let's get a move on. We'd better get going. Not so fast. What are you doing here? - We got fired. - It's all JB's fault. JB sold us a murder clip and got his Ego to drain TBN's database. Some nerve! One little mistake in my past and they think I did it. The morons! - You're not smart enough, dear. - They still think it was me. But JB isn't here, so what are you hanging around for? JB has a 1-terabit connection. Only the military uses that kind of speed. We just had to try it. - It doesn't look military to me. - No, that's our group. - Is that you? - Our Egos. - Can this get me to Stoiss? - You can't spy on Stoiss anymore. - He killed the surveillance cameras. - Why don't you just go on over? Two months ago I cashed in the bounty on The Pyke. Then it turns out the fucker works for Stoiss. I'm not welcome there. It's a drag, anyway. A bunch of people groping each other. - Those parties are the worst. - Parties? Get lost. - Hey, wait up! - I can't. My pulse is too fast. Get back here! This way! Take it easy. This way. Cables, yeah right! Stoiss wasn't going to make a fool of me again. I'd already cleaned up the mess his technicians had made of the domain. Believe me, they weren't exactly the cream of the crop. And this, their latest gadget. didn't impress me at all. The machine I couldn't hack was yet to be created. Still, it had taken me six months to break into Stoiss', - - and now I had five months and 30 days less to do it again. But at least I was rid of the two boneheads. - Hi, boys. - Why are you such a pain in the ass? Goddamn it! Enough! It wears down the battery. You just lost five hours. They started it. Time's running out, dear boy. Focus on the job. Only if you give your goons the boot. Deal. But I want to see results. And punch in every six hours. - Or else I stop the gadget. - Oh, you're too kind. Get going! - What's up? - Stoiss wants to talk to you! Marleen? I need your help. Not after that stunt you pulled with The Pyke. - Shut up! JB's gone. - So I just heard. But my lips are sealed. I'm through being a snitch. Hello, young man. Excuse me, but it's my turn. - The lady wants to be served. - I don't serve drags! You do now. Or do you want a sex change operation instead? Just tell her to speak up. - Vitamin B. - What about JB? - Why don't you dress up every day? - Out with it. I got it on with one of Stoiss" bodyguards. A real stud. - And &g ... if you catch my drift. - I'm with you. They just zapped JB in the basement. He won't obey Stoiss. Rumor has it Stoiss" account is being drained. Where can I find JB? Want some? - At Stoiss'? - Isn't Stoissy a hunk? I'm mad about old powerful men. But he's mad about that Barbie ... - Marleen! - I saw him in the basement. My old scout leader would've been proud of my map reading skills. But some things weren't taught to boy scouts. A terabit cable in the basement was one giant leak in the system. The question was: Who was using it? It seemed the question was. Who was using who? What the hell do you think you're doing? I'll beat your brains out! Asshole! What a dickhead! Just tell me if you don't want me to drink all your beer. Don't move out. Miauw. - You look ... - You don't look too good yourself. What's that? My new heart. With love from Stoiss. I have 25 hours to finish a job for him or else it goes off, and I die. Good way to get the job done. Take it off and let's go. - I already tried to hack it. I can't. - Hey, it's a fingerprint lock. - Forget it. It doesn't work. - Sure it does. Get me Stoiss' fingerprint and I'll fix you one of these. If I can fix an elevator, why not a little piss-ant bug like that? Trust me. It works. You can trust me. I'll pay up. I just need some more time. Give me a little more time. No! The terabit connection in the john was a major leak in the system. couldn't fix it without my Cyber Ego. Maybe I could reason with Stoiss. But the dealer just tried to, and look where it got him. - How are things? - I can't do it without my Ego. Nice try. I won't let you into my domain with an Ego. - How do you expect me to work? - Manually. - What a joke! - Brandy? - I've been to the basement. - How did you like it? - Only the really twisted go there. - I met Barbie down there. She's a killer on the dance floor. It's like sex, only without touching. - Liar. She's on her way here. - Nope. She went all the way. No panties or anything. She was with some leather guy. They were kissing ... French kissing. Who knows what she's doing right now. She was hot. I wasn't the only one with heart problems. Is he that touchy about everything? Didn't you get anything? For some reason he's always groping my neck. - That looks pretty analog to me. - Shut up while I'm working. You've been a good boy. This ought to do it. Let me get a close look. Closer. I promise not to kiss you. Ready? What's happening? JB, stop that! What do I press? JB ... JB, are you okay? You've tampered with my stuff for the last time. - Fuck, you had me scared. - How do you think I felt? That must be some bug. Usually I can fix them. Let's not try again. Stoiss must have encoded it with his DNA. You can't copy that. I need an Ego. Any mediocre one will do. I'll get you one. You wouldn't know a disc drive from a food processor. - I know two TBN nerds who'll help. - Drop it. I have to punch in now. Find Milos. He might have an Ego. - Where does he live? - Nowhere. Find him on the Net. - He logs on as "Milkab"”. Find him. - But how? Ask your nerdy friends. - I'm punching in. - Punch in accepted. Run a replay of our last group entry. - Data not found. - My blood sugar is too low for this. Okay, what is the estimated time - - for a manual batch scan of the group's transactions this month? Manual batch scan: 40 hours. What is the latest transaction? Six million transferred - - to account number 009839608. That's my account! Reverse that transferal. Only original Ego has access to the account. - How was the money deposited? - Deposits can be made freely. This was just great. No way would Stoiss believe I was innocent now. Was Stoiss toying with me? Was he using my Ego? Who else could transfer six million to my account? I made you some tea. Just the way you like it. Isn't it great to get some spending money? Say "thank you." You're going to explain everything to Stoiss right now. I am? - I can't see shit! - Oh, it's you. - Couldn't you tell it was me? - This place is crawling with freaks. - So, what are you playing at? - I want to explain it to him myself. Sure, he won't wonder why the money is in your account. - What's the catch?? - I want you to do me a favor. What are you doing? Everyone knew it was a bad idea to wake Stoiss from his hyper sleep. He'd get even more ticked off if he saw me with Barbie. - I'm leaving. - No, you're staying. - I'm leaving. - Leave, and I'll scream. I can handle Stoiss. I'm the only one who can. - Why are you doing this? - To help you. - I can take care of myself. - If you help me, I'll help you. You do know what will happen if Stoiss wakes up? Yes. - I need you to do me a favor. - Not till we get our database. Find out where "Milkab" logged on last. - Sounds easy. Get to work. - I don't know how it works. - Get to work! - Hit me if you like. I won't help you. The Pyke can hit Miauw. You little prick. Should I cash in on that bounty again? - Miauw said ...? - Miauw said fuck! Move! - Go, go! - Help me find Milos. - Give us our database first. - All right, get out! Okay, we'll help you. Link up the computer. I'm not going anywhere until you do. - He logs on as "Milkab". - And? - What group is he in? - The same as JB. - What group is that? - You know. - Shut up! - He's in the top group. - Then I suggest you look there! - Don't you think we'd better go? Okay, I've got the address. It's nearby. - What do you want me to do? - A little favor. - I just did. - Appetizer. Where's the bathroom? What do you want? The bathroom? It had taken me years to learn how to operate complex systems. What was the system here? And why did I feel like I had cheated on Miauw? She was just my partner. And I was just trying to survive. When a program crashes, the programmer fixes it. But who fixes the programmer? I dreamt about her. She was with someone. I can feel it. Look ... Stay there., you idiot. She isn't coming home anymore. You scared her off. Stay away from her. If my boys see you with her ... - That cable guy ... - Milos? Is he your accomplice? He's vanished. Find him. - I'm trying to. - I want results. You're goofing off while my account is being drained. From now on you work with my boys. Mind if I go to the john? He thinks he's in control ...! Thinks he's in control ... Barbie, we have to get out of here. Two of Stoiss' bodyguards are right outside. Let's go! Be quiet. - What's going on? - I'm just dealing with your punch. - She's screwing Stoiss. - Why does he put up with her? - He's losing his touch. - He should just smack her ... Shit! Look, my time is running out. - What's going on? - It's simple. I get you Stoiss' prints, you remove the gadget and get back your disc. If you do me a favor. - I want Stoiss dead. - So shoot him. No weapon gets past his detector or his bodyguards. - So lure him away. - That's what I want you to do. - I'm not going to kill anyone. - I want Stoiss dead. Didn't she know that shooting Stoiss would shut down the domain? Forget it. We're not running a shelter here. Piss off! Move! This way! Get the fuck away! I want Stoiss dead. I'm entering the apartment now. - Goddamn it! - Miauw? I'm okay. I think I found Milos. He's dead. For some time now. CABLE OPERATOR - Milos was an army cable operator. - He got JB the terabit connection. He got the whole group terabit connections. The fool wrote it down. This isn't Milos' apartment. It belongs to Stoiss' girl. - Barbie? - She tucked Milos, found the book. That's how she found the rest of the group. She's known Stoiss for a long time. - She made a list of her lovers. - Besides Stoiss? - He'd never allow that. - That's why she did it. What is she after? - Where is everything controlled at? - Cyberworld. - And the ultimate power center is? - The top group. - What do you need to start a group? - A good connection to the Net. Milos. - And then?? - Money. - Someone to finance it. - Rosenstein. - And? - Protection. Mess with a terabit connection and the Net police shut you down. Stoiss! - And the most important thing is ... - An architect. You need a programmer to design the group. JB. But they're all top members. What does she want from them? She wants to kill them. Take over their Egos. And their accounts. That way she can take control of the Net's top group. Power and money. She's more concerned about what Stoiss loses. - I don't want the two of you with me. - Just like the apartment ... Stay here. I'm just going to warn JB to stay away from Barbie. They're closing the gates! - You were too slow. - I know you. Piss off! Find JB! Piss off! - Now what? - We do it the hard way. I know another way in. But it's not very inviting. - Let's come back tomorrow ... - Come on! / once had a race car that drove round in circles till the battery died. It was sad to see it go through the last lap and then stop. I was on my last lap and I couldn't find the exit My only chance to stop the countdown was to kill Stoiss. But I couldn't. I had to find another way out. I was exhausted. I was riding on the edge. Just a little push and ... ERROR JB. I have something to tell you. - I don't have time. - They're all dead. - Don't care. - Your entire group is dead. - Their Egos are all that's left. - Stop it. I can't ... - You're next, JB. - How do you know? - No more killing. - Just Stoiss. Then it's over. No! What are you going to do, JB? Let's assume Stoiss believed you. If you could convince him I was taking his money, what would he do? - I don't care. Stoiss is going to kill me. You know that, don't you? Which of us is going to die? You, me ... ...or Stoiss? No! Who's going to die? Are we all going to die or what? - Where are you going? - To clean her up. If she killed Stoiss, the group would shut down in 24 hours. Could he have given her his security code? He must have. Stoiss or Barbie? It was like Russian roulette with two bullets. But maybe Barbie's gun could turn the odds. - It's this way. - I'm tired. I need a break. Hurry up! Couldn't you have found a nicer way in? A dead body could float around here for years without being found. Gee, that's reassuring. - Come on! - Let me catch my breath. JB! What is it? - Back up. Stay away! - What is it? Darling? Milos is dead. Dead as a doornail! There's only the two of us left in the group. What are you planning? - Don't you see it's an intruder? - I only see you. That's all you're going to see. This is the end of the line for me. - Not if you hand over the intruder. - I won't have any more killing. I see. That's not for you to decide. Sure it is. I'll just wait here until I slip into the next phase. - I won't let you off that easily. - It's the only solution. I have life insurance. I synchronized the devices. - They stop beating simultaneously. - She's not involved in this. I looked at your disc. Does Miauw know you've got a copy of her there? - That's not true. - That's why you adore that disc. You love her. But you're afraid to tell her. So you programmed her Ego instead. Almost as good as the real thing. She's just as bad. She's put her life on the line for you. Another way of saying "I love you." This is insane. She's my partner, that's all. Look at her and repeat that. Okay. Barbie is the perpetrator. Do you have to die to believe it? - I want evidence! - Come back in an hour. Alone. - Alone?? - Alone. I'd like you to meet an old friend of yours. Think you can handle her when she's tied up? It would be my final meeting with Stoiss. You don't leave such a thing to chance. Particularly not when Barbie's gun played an important part. - You're alone? - Yes. Who can you trust? The money is in my account. I didn't deposit it there. My dear little ... ORGANIC HEART STABLE Bye-bye, Miauw! I was looking forward to this. But an ice pick in your brain is SO unbecoming. - You're no knockout as it is. - Marleen, you're an angel. Get that thing off. - Hand over the disc and the gun. - Come on, baby. - No more games. - Come on. - Say you love me. - Give me the disc. No, give me the disc. It's up to you. I either shoot you in the gut or ... It's what you've always wanted, Ouch! You split my eardrum. They really hurt, those paint bullets. But they're not very effective. I believe that's mine. - Where's Miauw? - I stuck to my end of the deal. I've got to handle this. Afterwards I want you out of here. I never want to see you in Technopolis again. Say something. Stoiss, say something! Say something, goddamn it. Stoiss! No! JB! All of a sudden I didn't care about my disc. What did I need it for now that I had Miauw in my arms? VA = A There was nothing between us. We went to see the green grass Miauw always talked about. / gave Dot my disc. Along with my terabit connection o the group. At least that way he could be with Darling's Cyber Ego. Just like I was with Miauw at last. ! didn't even miss my Cyber Ego ... ...that much. Subtitles: Helle Schou Kristiansen - IFT A/S
