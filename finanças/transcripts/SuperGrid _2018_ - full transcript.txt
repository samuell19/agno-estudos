(SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC) Subtitles by explosiveskull (DRAMATIC MUSIC) The sky is black. The water is poison. Brothers and sisters, these earthquakes that shake us up each day, they ain't natural. MAN: Come on, baby, come over here. (UPBEAT MUSIC) P.A. ANNOUNCER: Brought to you by Sino-Gazam. Have a nice day. Those venturing out onto the SuperGrid do so at their own risk. Jackal tribes are deadly and will shoot on sight. Earthquake levels are on the rise. Stay in cities, stay safe. Brought to you by Sino-Gazam. Have a nice day. (UPBEAT ROCK MUSIC) Those venturing out onto the SuperGrid do so at their own risk. Fuck you, bud. P.A. ANNOUNCER: Earthquake levels are on the rise. Stay in cities, stay safe. Brought to you by Sino-Gazam. Have a nice day. (UPBEAT ROCK MUSIC) (YELLING) P.A. ANNOUNCER: Stay in cities, stay safe. Brought to you by Sino-Gazam. Have a nice day. We never should have allowed them to leave in the first place. Now we've got 60 million Americans dying of the hard lung. Thousands of new cases every day, and no one taking responsibility. And if you think it's tough in the cities, be a cargo runner for the mob and spend a day on the SuperGrid. The death tolls are triple. (COUGHING) MALE BROADCASTER: Allowed them to leave? When you sell six million hectares to another country, they're allowed to do whatever they want with them. FEMALE BROADCASTER: Shut up, I'm talking now, it's my show. You act like there was some other choice. The national debt... MALE BROADCASTER: Of course there was another choice. At least there was before we started to parcel out parts of our country to the highest bidder. (SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC) GUAN YIN: Hello, Deke, we've been looking for you. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Okay, okay. Hi, Deacon. You have some explaining to do. You know, you didn't need to come down here. Believe me, I didn't fucking wanna come down here. (CHUCKLING) I just wanted to hear it from my own donkey's mouth. You failed your run. Why? Your driver was inexperienced. The driver was your fucking sister, Deacon. It wasn't her fault. It doesn't matter to me whose fault it was, and I'm actually sorry for your loss. But it was a crucial run, man. Now you gotta go back. We had a deal, one more run. I did what I could. Did you? Really? That's funny. Because if you did, I don't think we'd all be here right now. I mean, you'd probably be having dinner with your sister Jude and your whole family. Why don't you just send your goon squad? Listen, kid, this isn't a fucking negotiation anymore, okay? You gotta do this under the radar. Complete it, or we'll kill the only sibling you have left. Speaking of which, you'll get a lot further this time if you just get your old driver out of retirement. It's your last shot, buddy. Make it count. Guys, guys, he's got a big job to do, so you know, keep away from his hands and the eyes and the rest of his fucking spirit. Eh, eh, eh. Honey, don't worry, it'll be quick. It's that grid life. (GROANING) I'm sorry, buddy. Good luck, and we'll see you in a couple days. ANNOUNCER: Overwatch, for your protection. Call now. (COUGHING) Shit, Deke, you're sick. Who isn't? NORTH: No. Do you think he'll go with you? No, but I gotta try. Give this to him, would you? Yep. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (COMPUTER WHIRRING) DEKE: You know they make those things so no one else can fix them now. Shit, you've got nerve. Give me a bucket, quick. (WATER RUNNING) (DRINK POURING) You shouldn't be drinking. What are you having for dinner? I could stay, help make something. Forgot how fun you were to talk to. All right, well, I gotta go back. JESSE: For what? Yeah, I got one more run. One more run? I don't have a choice, man. Get out. Give me a chance to explain. Get out! (DOOR OPENING AND SLAMMING) (GLASS BREAKING) Hey. I'm leaving, I get it. What the fuck is wrong with you? You could've spared my sister. Our sister. I'm not dying on that fucking grid, Deke. We'll be back in two days. Is that what you told Jude? Get the fuck outta here. (SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC) P.A. ANNOUNCER: Those venturing out onto the SuperGrid do so at their own risk. Jackal tribes are deadly and should be avoided. Earthquake levels are on the rise. Stay in cities, stay safe. Brought to you by Sino-Gazam. Good morning. (SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Fuck. Goddammit, Deke. (COUGHING) (DEEP BREATHING) (PHONE BUZZING) (SIREN BLARING) Smoking with the lung, real smart. You're gonna wanna see this. Wow, now that's a letdown on wheels. Shut up. Get in the hood. Is that a? Thorium cell. Yeah, I took it as a parting gift on my last run. And you put it into the this? Yeah, it's a big enough chassis, and it's what Spanner had. (GUN COCKING) Hands to God, or this truck's next paint job is arterial red. How'd you get in here? You gave me the code, remember? Not so you'd show up unannounced. You bring me a fucking drink? That's better. Little Deke. Hey, okay. - Cheers. - Cheers. It's nice to see you, man. You too, Spanner. I would fuck you, now. So you put a Thorium cell generator in an antique shitbox? Hid it in an antique shitbox. This will outlast any Jack car on the grid, and no need to trade for fuel. So how's that skin coming? I installed ballistic glass, tacked on this carbon fiber, just waiting on you for the cowboy lining. Is this thing bulletproof? Not proof. Resistant. Will it stop a bullet or not? I don't know. Are you using this car to primarily stop bullets? Nope. Hey, we should start this thing up. Does this mean you're coming with me? Yeah, like I'd just leave you out there like... I left Jude? Get in. If anybody's gonna kill you, it's gonna be me. (DOOR SLAMMING) Hang on, Little D. Coming outta retirement. Brothers Campbell, ride again. Whoo. (TRUCK STARTING) I'm gonna move. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) So where we going? Across the border, that's all I know. What's our cargo? DEKE: I don't know. You don't know what the cargo is? DEKE: No. Jesus Christ. Fuck, what's it matter? It's not like we get to pick and choose our runs anyways. No, but you can prepare. As soon as you don't prepare, that's when you get hit. (ENGINE REVVING) (HELICOPTER FLYING) (GARAGE DOOR OPENING) Jesse, whoopee, it's good to see you on the side of your brother for his final run. Well done. That's not what you're driving. I don't think she likes your car, guys. Follow me. LAZLO: You better listen. We can get you onto the grid at two p.m. Make sure you're well fed. You'll need to overnight out there before you hit the border wall. You gotta be fucking kidding me. Coordinates, fueling locations, Jackal ambush groups and blockades. You've both dealt with Jacks before, but now they're more desperate. Without weapons or water to trade, you won't last a mile. You've got 250 water cells. Trade them wisely. Deke still has the mission details, don't you, Deke? DEKE: What's this? All in good time, get packed. Yeah, we're off in an hour. We have no Overwatch, that's why I'm calling you. And no one knows the route better than you and Owl. You're not gonna make me beg, are you? JESSE: Deke? Yeah. JESSE: Let's go. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) OFFICER: Papers? (DRAMATIC MUSIC) JESSE: Here we go. (ENGINE REVVING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Aw, fuck no. Helps with the stress. Chew some fucking gum. How far to the first fuel barricade? I think like 20 miles up B12. How about be sure? GUAN YIN: Campbell, confirm your frequency. Confirmed. GUAN YIN: Stay on this channel, report back when you've made it across the border. Copy. (SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC) JESSE: Where do you wanna overnight, Black Lake? DEKE: Yeah. JESSE: You still talk to Eagle? Here and there. She's holding it down out there, but the lakes are polluted now. They're gonna need water cells pretty badly. Yeah, I bet. So, uh, you two still, you know? (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (EARTH CRACKING) (SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC) It's weirdly quiet, are you sure about this? DEKE: Jacks barricaded the roads. There's no other way through. 30 water cells should do it. JESSE: Better let me do the talking. Don't do anything stupid. DEKE: Me? (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Where you all headed? To the border. In this thing? We got 30 cells to pass. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) We're gonna need 50. Fine, 50 cells. Nice negotiating. Shit. You ain't as pretty as the last driver they brought through here. Remember her? The boys up the road had quite the time with her. What the fuck you say? Deke, get back in the truck. You wanna get farther than you got last time, pull 50 more cells. We're gonna need 100. We won't make it to the border. That's not our problem. If you wanna get his piece of shit up the road far enough to see what the coyotes left behind of the last driver, hand over 50 more cells. (SHOTS FIRING) What the fuck. Get in the truck. (GUNS FIRING) Fuck. (ENGINE REVVING) What about being discreet? We couldn't afford to give up that much water. I thought we didn't have Overwatch. We don't. Well you were hanging halfway outta the car, and I didn't shoot that guy. Oh, here we go. Guan Yin, Brezhnev, do you copy? Guan Yin, Brezhnev, come in. Campbell brothers. The brothers schmuck, you got Lazlo. Did you send an Overwatch? LAZLO: Did I send a support team to cover you? No. Are you sure? LAZLO: Who are you, the fucking president? You don't get backup, you're on your own. Fucking prick. Here. What's with your fucking fork? It's adorable. (ENGINE RUNNING) (SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC) Come out to the grid, she says, no big deal. You'll be fine, no one's gonna get hurt. Oh, what do you have to say for yourself? Tough break. They're all fish in a barrel. Not sure that was necessary, headed your way now. (GUN FIRING) Are you Overwatch? Put down the gun. That's my brother at your feet. Put it down, go back inside. You know there's a sniper scope on you. (RETCHING) (COUGHING) Sorry. (ENGINE RUNNING) JESSE: Here goes nothing. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (GUNS COCKING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Eagle. It's okay. You have any water? Can you get those pads over there? Yeah. Thank you. About that water. PATIENT: Thank you. EAGLE: You're welcome. (RETCHING) Jesse, you can't just catch it, go help. He's right, you know, it's caused by exposure. First stage is cough, then shakes, but I've seen it get much worse. Like a leprosy that poisons both mind and body. Dick. (SOFT MUSIC) (BIRDS CALLING) (SOFT MUSIC) We have fungi growing in the fields. They slow down the symptoms of it. We used it to cure the soil after the supplements stopped coming in. It's the closest thing we have to medicine. More medicine than what we've got. Off the grid, they still think it's a virus, and PharmacAid's just making out like bandits. I wish we could give you more water. You need it to cross the border. I get it. We should be able to trade with the Jacks for some meat with it. I know, but... It's okay. (COUGHING) Here, drink some water. (SOFT MUSIC) Pretty gross, huh? Yeah, you're pretty disgusting. (LAUGHING) JESSE: Where's a good place to camp? DEKE: I was thinking the north hills. There's shacks all over the res. You park at the foot of the hills, that's probably the safest. It's not safe here? Uh, not with you guys here, after Deke's last overnight. The Consortium came looking for us. Do you need any more guns? We have guns, we need water. You need the guns more than we do. You should get going. Yeah. Thanks, Eagle. We'll bring more clean water on our way back, I promise. Sure. (SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC) (TRUCK STARTING) (SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC) Here? I don't wanna get too far off the road, in case we've gotta bolt. I haven't seen a night this clear over the grid in years. Yeah, well, it doesn't help us any. Speaking of not helping, get your side. That's a big fucking tarp. JESSE: It's a big fucking car. DEKE: Is this seriously all we're doing? JESSE: Well, as long as the Jacks don't have thermal tracking, yeah. I gotta piss. (PANTS UNZIPPING) (URINE FLOWING) (SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC) Shit. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Get his gun. Come on, man, those are expensive. You won't be finishing it. Where's the cargo? I asked you where the cargo was. DEKE: We haven't picked up yet. Bullshit. I'll check the car. (SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC) Just a tremor, boys, stay sharp. (GUN FIRING) What the fuck? (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (GUN FIRING) (STRUGGLING) (GUNS FIRING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (GUNS FIRING) (GUN FIRING) Shit. Little help. Give me a sec. Don't have one. (GUNS FIRING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (GUNS FIRING) (GUNS FIRING) (COUGHING) Thanks. It wasn't me. NORTH: It was me. North? NORTH: Hey, Campbell. JESSE: You're our Overwatch? NORTH: Off the books. And you knew about this? Called her. Jesus Christ. You've gotta get moving if you're gonna make it to the border. We can keep D22 fairly clear from here. OWL: North, sorry to break up the family reunion. I'm getting a decent amount of radiation coming from that beautiful vehicle they're driving. Resistant. Not proof. Owl, what kind of a leak are we looking at? OWL: Yeah, there's a breach. Since I'm guessing they can hear me, I should say it's nonlethal, probably. All right, you two have to move now. What do you expect me to say? I don't want you to say anything right now. I'll radio you two from the grid when you reach the border. Nice to see you, asshole. Jesse, I... Get in the car. What makes you think we can trust her? Jesse, she's your ex-wife. No one knows the grid better than North. With Lazlo sending us out alone, she's the only one I can count on to do it for... For what? For honor? For free. She gave me this to give to you. What's it mean? It's a grenade pin. From the first time she saved me out here. That's dumb. You're dumb. Pass me the walkie. Guan Yin, you there? GUAN YIN: Have you crossed the border? 50 miles out. What's our cargo? GUAN YIN: Deke has the itinerary and instructions. Yeah, what's our cargo? GUAN YIN: You're on a need-to-know basis, over and out. What the fuck did you get us into? (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Am I in trouble? 50 miles from the border. Without incident, they should be there in a few hours. Without incident. Get off. I think we just had two incidents. You better hope they pull this off. You know who's on the chopping block next if they don't. (EARTH SHAKING) So was Jesse surprised to see you? To say the least, stubborn prick. You know, we can't cross the border. The nearest crossover point's 30 clicks outta the way. I know. We'll watch from O76, and then pick them up when they cross back. If they cross back. Canada's cannibal country, don't forget. Do you think a drone would last on the other side? Hmm. We'll see. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) North, Owl, you there? We're here, Deke, about two miles from the border west of the gate. Okay, we're approaching, how's the leak? OWL: Same as it was, be careful. Yeah, right. NORTH: Gonna put a drone on you, see how long it lasts. Thanks, talk to you on the other side. Did you pack the drone? You packed the drone. (SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC) We got eyes on you. Get out of the vehicle. What a piece of shit. DEKE: We've got water, 100 cells. The famous Campbell brothers. Goddam, you guys are uglier than I heard. Word's already traveled up here, you took out four proud boys last night. We were ambushed at Black Lake. I'm gonna need 100 cells for each one of them. Reparations. We only have 100 left. You only brought 100 cells to the border? We've crossed lotsa times with less. Things change. It's gotten worse out here. And there's a lot less of you fuckers passing through. We don't have 400 cells. Well you better go back and get it then. Not possible. Where you headed? Don't make me ask you again. DEKE: We don't know. Bullshit. And I wasn't asking you. It's true. It's true. (LAUGHING) You must think we're stupid. We could just let you cross on foot. (GUN COCKING) And see how long it takes before someone brings us your head. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Stop. Look under the hood. JESSE: Dammit, Deke. What did you say? Look in the hood of the truck. Open it. Do it! (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Thorium cell, we're picking up more of them. Take the water now, let us through and we'll give you one. We'll be back in a few hours. We have to come back through these gates. It's the only way. Get the water. Get it! (DRAMATIC MUSIC) I'll be seeing you soon. If you don't got no Thorium cell for us, there ain't gonna be no prison, for you both. (SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC) (TRUCK STARTING) Lying to those Jacks, I hope you know what you're doing. Of course I don't, but what the fuck was I supposed to do? Guan Yin, we're across the border. GUAN YIN: Good work, Campbell. Take S64 north, keep in touch. Copy. Gee thanks. North, we're on the other side. NORTH: Owl? OWL: Yeah, we're close. NORTH: Boys, we've got eyes on you. OWL: Okay, here we go. Welcome aboard Air Owl. This is your captain speaking. If you look directly below, you'll see two dumbasses headed to their demise. (SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC) Hey, eyes on the road. Just resting them. Yeah. This isn't a fucking vaca here. OWL: Steady, guys, there's a Sino gassing vehicle up ahead. (SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC) Okay, shit got real. Let's hope you do better than them. Guan Yin, on S64, buncha your dead buddies on the grid. GUAN YIN: Check your tracker. DEKE: Yeah. GUAN YIN: What does it say? About 20 clicks ahead, off-road. GUAN YIN: Good, proceed. (SIGHING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) JESSE: Something big dead ahead. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Jesus, it's a fortress. Guan Yin, you said this was a pickup. GUAN YIN: It is, but I didn't say it would be easy. Find the case at those coordinates. Stop at nothing. (SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC) Owl are you there? OWL: We've got eyes on you. The area's crawling with Jacks, so you should holster your pistols. One shot, and they'll all be all over you. All be all, you get what I mean. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Enter on the west side of the fence. There's no Jacks in sight. I'm gonna sweep around, see how many I can count. Hey, don't do anything stupid, okay? Me? OWL: Deke, if you can get through that fence, go left, less Jacks. Follow me. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) OWL: Okay, follow my voice. I'm gonna lead you to safety. Only one, a few turns up. Stop, move slowly and stay low. Don't make any sound, okay, look out. Now right. Pass the red car, up ahead. See him? Okay, keep going. Turn. Come on, guys. (SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC) Okay, you're clear for a while now. Shit, sorry. This is it. (SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC) (GLASS BREAKING) OWL: Nice job, guys. JESSE: Jesus. OWL: Now move fast, you won't have long. It's your party. When's the last time you guys even talked? Sort of, drops outta communication, eh? You deserve better, you know? Mm-hmm. It'll be okay. Good talk. (SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC) Hey, stay calm, Guan Yin sent us. Where's your cargo? (GRUNTING) (SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC) Give me the code. I didn't tell them. You think I'll tell you? We're you're only way outta here. What's the code? It's classified. Hey, if we're taking this thing across the border, we need to know what we're carrying. I'm sorry. No, you fucking think you're sorry. Give me the fucking code. Man, you don't need to die here. Three, zero, six, seven, six, one, five. (SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC) What is it? I don't know, vials of something. What is this? A chemical compound, from the reactor site. It's a weapon? No, it's a cure. A cure? For the epidemic, the lung. We went to the source, looking for causes. We found a vaccine. It's made up of waste and mushrooms. Okay, so what's Lazlo want with this? It's a pretty significant bargaining chip. Bargaining chip? Do you know how many fucking people are dying for this? Holy shit, Eagle. How do you use this? It's a shot, diluted, direct to the lung. Now kill me. Please, kill me. Look, I'm already dead. If that doesn't make it back safe and intact, they're gonna kill you, and your families. OWL: Shit, Deke, Deke, Jacks incoming. We've gotta go now. Fuck, move. Let's go, now. I'm sorry. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) MAN IN HOOD: Where is it? Where is it? (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (GUN FIRING) OWL: I'm gonna politely say move as fast as you can. What the fuck do we do? We can't give this to Lazlo. No shit. We gotta get this thing across the border. You need to move now, Jacks on your tail. They're on bikes and moving fast. Shit. If they're on bikes, they've got speed on us. Got another problem. North, Thorium cell's leaking, we might not make it home. Fucking thing. Try Spanner. DEKE: Spanner, you there? Deke, how's the... DEKE: Thorium cell's leaking, Jacks in pursuit. 10-four, what's your 20? Closing in on the border, we're still north of the wall. Trying to get to Black Lake. Copy that. Heading for the grid. Spanner, Spanner. North, where the fuck are you? North, where do we get off, how close are they? North, North, where the fuck are they? Well lookee here, we found ourselves an Overwatch. (LAUGHING) All right. Bring them to the wall. Where are they? Dropped off, they mighta lost the drone. Just drive, our turn's soon. Deke, do you copy? Campbell, report your position. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (GUAN YIN SCREAMING) Fuck. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Coming up fast. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (GUN FIRING) Shit. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Shit. (RAPID FIRING) DEKE: Jesse, that's the guy that took Jude. Shit, Deke, get on Suzie. Hang onto something. (RAPID FIRING) (RAPID FIRING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Bikes coming up, better get up top. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Hurry up! No shit. (GUN FIRING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (GUN FIRING) (RAPID FIRING) All right, Suzie. (GUN FIRING) DEKE: Shit, it's jammed, I gotta reload. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (GUN FIRING) Deke, fucking shoot this fuck. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (SHOT FIRING) Shit. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) This is our turn. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) They've got the case, but they've seen inside. They should be close to the border by now. They should be? You don't have eyes on them? I'm the only one fucking working here? I can't get anyone on radio. So they could be dead. They could be, but I think they are headed for Black Lake. New MO. We'll get them ourselves. Onto the grid? There's a reason we pay... This case is too valuable. If it doesn't get off the grid, getting paid is the least of our worries. I should have set the fucking tank. How far are we? Close, but what the fuck are we gonna do when we get there? They're coming in hot. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Stand them up. Hey, hey. Relax. It's gonna be fine. You let them know not to come in too hot, Mama Bear. Tell him. NORTH: Deke, Jesse. North, what the fuck, we're close to the border. The border's blocked. I have no idea what's behind you. They've got us at the border. Throw a flare up, Jesse. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (GUNS COCKING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Hold your fire. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Thought you boys were gonna put on a little show for us there. I don't have a Thorium cell for you. KURTIS: Why not? I lied, it wasn't the cargo. The ball's on you, kid. Look, just take my Thorium cell, keep the truck, and we'll slide on outta here with our Overwatch. Oh, you're gonna slide on outta here, huh? Just slide on out? Yeah, that sounds real nice. The only problem is we kinda got used to having them around, these two. They're like family to us. Am I right? JACKS: Yeah. Fuck yeah. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Why don't you just tell me what you got? Seems like it's the only bargaining chip you got at this point. We can't show you the cargo. Get out. LAZLO: Campbell brothers, please come in. Copy. Good, nice of you to copy. Have you crossed the border? Yeah, just did, headed for the south checkpoint. I was starting to get nervous, Deacon. You weren't gonna come home. I do crazy shit when I get nervous. Crazy, crazy shit. Yeah, well, we were chased. Had to deal with Jacks. Just tell me, was the pickup a success? Yep. Headed home now. LAZLO: Why don't you meet us at Black Lake? Let us off the grid. There's nothing for you at Black Lake. That wasn't a request, Deacon. We'll see you soon. Great work. I'm a prick. Prepare your team for Black Lake. Double time. Looks like you're gonna have to dump your cargo if you wanna make it. Jesse. I got this. I highly doubt that. Open it. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) What the fuck is that? They don't tell us, you know that. Bullshit. Careful. It's nothing, huh? We think it's a cure. KURTIS: A cure? Yeah, but we're not giving it back to the Consortium. Fucking right you're not going to. Bound these four up. Wait, you come with us. You'll have access to it too. I have all the access I need right here. Yeah, but you need a doctor. Someone's gotta dilute and inject that stuff. We got one at Black Lake. We'll get you off the grid. Come to Black Lake and fight with us. Come get your freedom. (SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC) My daughter gets the cure first. Yeah. Of course. (SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC) (ENGINES STARTING) First time your big mouth's got us outta trouble. You okay? Yeah, you? Hey. Sure you know what you're doing? Don't worry, done more with less. (SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC) Deke? I know, shouldn't be... It's not that. Listen, uh, what happened to Jude wasn't your fault. It was mine. No, Jesse. No, I shoulda been there. I knew she wasn't ready. We started something real good here, Deke. Let's go finish it. (ENGINES REVVING) Come on, you fuckers. Satellites don't work on the grid. We're taking back channels. So everyone make sure you enter the coordinates before departure. Remember, there's no need to take anybody alive. Just get me that fucking case. Let's go, now! DEKE: I don't see any Consortium cars. Let me look. They're not there now, but they will be soon. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Let's go. Come and get them. There you go. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Shit. DEKE: Eagle. Deke, what the hell's going on? I'll tell you inside. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (COUGHING) It's okay, you're gonna be fine, okay? Is it a cure? We'll see, I guess. It's a mycelium compound? That's what he said. Mushrooms. Okay, let's give it a shot. Did they say how to administer it? Diluted, straight shot to the lung. I don't wanna kill her. What did you say? (COUGHING) Test it on me. Yeah. Test it on him first. Okay. (SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC) NORTH: It's funny, you always had such a bleak view of the future. And here you are fighting to save it. Yeah, well, sure hope that cure's for real. And I didn't always have a bleak view of the future. I just didn't wanna bring any more life into it. Doesn't mean the ones here aren't worth saving. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to... No. I begged you to get off the grid and leave this. Without you, we wouldn't have survived. No, you fucking wouldn't have. (SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC) OWL: Hope I'm not interrupting anything. Lazlo and his goons are one mile away. Deke, how's it going in there? DEKE: Good, just getting set up. JESSE: Span, how's it coming? Ahh. We need more time. EAGLE: Deke, are you sure? Yeah. Ready? Mmm-hmm. (SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC) What am I supposed to feel? Hopefully nothing right now. Can I sit up? Slowly, sure. Well at least it didn't kill me. EAGLE: Come here, sweetheart. How's it going out there? In formation. The charge is set around the perimeter. Don't worry about Jesse. He's the best driver I know, so as long as the car doesn't blow up, he'll be fine. What are you talking about, Spanner? Where's Jesse? (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Jesse, what are you doing? Spanner says the Thorium cell's unstable. Protect the cure, Deke. I'll try to buy you some time. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Incoming. Prepare for the attack on my mark. There's a chance they're not as stupid as I thought. Stay vigilant. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Here we go. What the fuck? Hi. Can I speak to Deacon please? He's indisposed. Listen to me, fuckstick, you're all gonna be very indisposed if you blow this, do you understand, Jesse? Do you understand, copy?
