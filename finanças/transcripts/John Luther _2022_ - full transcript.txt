The engagement is just over. At least it's over. It's an emergency. Can you not wait until the reception? No. It can't wait. What is more important for you, John? Just inform everyone. Why is he leaving so soon? 'Police station Devikulam' Sir. Felix. What happened? There is a CCTV at the hotel And a CCTV at a nearby ATM. The footages from them between 7pm - 10 pm... show this bike passing by at approximately 8pm. We see two people here. Prakash and Reji. Prakash is missing since the accident. Who filed the missing person case? Prakash's wife. Have any nearby hospitals reported accident cases? I checked but none has been reported. None? No. What information do we have on Prakash? He is a school teacher. He is also into real estate business. Reji and Prakash are partners in the business. According to the wife, who reported at Palarivattom station, they were at Munnar on a real estate dealing. Don't we have the motorbike in custody? Yes sir. We found remains of a headlight from the accident site. I believe it belongs to the vehicle that hit them. That vehicle would have later travelled with just one working But we have a problem. The last person who called Prakash was his wife. They informed her that they would leave by 7:30 pm. She maintains the same in the complaint report. CCTV visuals show them travelling from Munnar to Ernakulam. That means the vehicle that hit them must have come from the It would have been climbing up the mountain pass. But between 8:00 and 10:00 pm we have no visuals of vehicles coming up with one headlight Prakash's phone records prove that his wife was the last The frontside of the motorbike was hit. That means the other vehicle was definitely coming up. So, CCTV visuals must show the other vehicle. Right sir. This is very confusing now. Did Prakash's wife recieve any anonymous call after the No sir. Do we have his phone record? Yes sir. He recieved in total 18 phone calls. Most are from friends and family. But after the accident at 8:45 pm, his phone was switched off. Do you think this was a planned kidnapping? But we don't have any proof of kidnapping. Why did they go to Munnar? Identification of the hit and run vehicle. These are the answers we need. Do we have phone records of the deceased Reji? No sir. - I need to see that. - Okay sir. Goodmorning sir. Hello, John. The case is a headache. I am being pressured to drop Mohan's case. Any updates on the other case? We haven't been able to find them. Both their phones are switched off. Lijo's aunt lives closeby. They usually stay over with her. A policeman in plain clothes is watching over the house. We will nab the men once they turn up. I am being pressured by my superiors. I understand sir. Okay then. Thank you. Yes sir? Give me an update. I am standing next to the workshop. This is a perfect spot to watch the house. Any movement today? No sir. Nobody other than the newspaper boy. Listen, don't dare nod off. Until Manoj comes in the evening, standby and watch. Yes sir. Okay sir. Sir, Reji's call list. The last incoming call was at 8.30 pm. Duration : 32 seconds. I see. That means just before the accident. Yes. Do we have details of this incoming call? Yes sir. Yes sir? Is this Anil home, right? Yes, I am Anil. Do you know Reji from Ernakulam? Yes I do. How do you know him? I had assigned Reji to help me sell one of my properties. Was he here day before yesterday? Yes, he was here. Was Reji alone? No, he was accompanied by a friend. Do you know his name? His name was Prakash. How long have you known Prakash? I don't know Prakash. What time did they leave your house? About 8 pm. Did you contact them afterwards? I called Reji. Why? Reji left behind his reading glasses here. I noticed it after they left. I called to inform him the same. What did Reji say when you called? He told me he would come over to get it. But never turned up. Didn't you follow up after that? I got busy. What's the matter, sir? Nothing. It's just a routine enquiry. - Thank you. - Okay. Looks like the case has turned. Sir? I mean... Reji must have recieved Anil's call when he was going down When they returned to pick up his glasses they climbed up the pass again. That means the vehicle that hit them was going down the Cameras at the bottom of the pass will show. But we have a problem. There is only one petrol station going down the pass. That one has no cameras. The next town is 11 kms away. There are three deviations between them. And 10 - 12 pocket roads. A CCTV footage in such a case is impossible. What do we do sir? The vehicle that hit them would have had to pass the bus. Yes sir. Call the conductor and collect the numbers of the passengers. Okay. Ask the passengers to send us photographs... and videos they took during the time of the accident. Okay sir. Sir, these are not very visible. In which folder is the ATM's camera footage? Same folder, sir. Please open it. [Talking softly] Pull out the RC details of this vehicle. Okay sir. Joy, where was Varghese's daughter married to? - Alappuzha? - Yes, Alappuzha. - Isn't the boy dead? - Yes. - Drowned, eh? - Yes. Call me when you need a ride. Give my regards to your father. Sure. Varghese? Who's it? Yes? I came to see you. Me? What's the matter? I want a ride. Where to? - To Munnar. - To Munnar. And what's your luggage? Cupboard. That's simple. I can give you a ride. Who told you I was here? Careful! Your wife told me when I went by your home. Don't mind but... I haven't seen you before. You are not a local, are you? I am from Munnar. Now I get you. I know almost everyone in and around here. I know. You were in Munnar two days ago, right? Day before yesterday? No. I didn't have any ride. I was at home. I avoided it because of the rain. No, someone mentioned they saw you on the mountain pass. How's that possible? Someone said so. Weren't you in Munnar? No way. I was right here. - I was at home. - Alright Let me tell you. Your vehicle was involved in an accident. One of your headlights is out. Good that you replaced the headlight. Made it easy for me. I think you have the wrong person. It wasn't me. There is no chance. The accident you caused killed a person. His name is Reji. There was a second person on the bike, Prakash. He is missing. Where is he? Is he alive or did you kill him? What do you mean I killed him? Don't talk rubbish. Get lost. I have work. I have work too. Leave me alone. I have to go. I am going too but not without you. Felix. Take Varghese brother in. Sir, it was not me! It wasn't me! Please don't hurt me! Please! Get in you! Felix, bring the vehicle. Sir, please listen to me! Please! Let's go Sir, hear me out please! Please don't sir! Stop hitting me, please! Tell me the truth. Please don't beat me anymore! Now tell me, Varghese. What happened on that day? Sir, honestly I do not know anything. Is this the only vehicle you own? Yes sir. You told me you didn't have a ride on that day. Right? Then whose vehicle is this? This photo was taken after the accident. The receipt for replacing the headlight and painting your Do you have anything to say? I'll tell you the truth, sir. Tell me. What happened on that day? I went to Munnar to deliver vegetables. But I was delayed. It was raining heavily on my return. [Singing] This is the truth. It was not intentional, sir. I was too scared to tell. It's the truth, sir. Are you going to tell me what you did to Prakash... or do you want me to beat it out of you? Sir, I have no idea who Prakash is. What happened to Prakash then? Did he vanish into thin air? Say it out! Say it! Let's see how adamant you can be. Please don't beat me, sir! A minute, sir. Tell me I say! Tell me what you did with Prakash. Sir. I enquired about Varghese. He is a middle-class family man. He lives in Adimaali. He had a problem with one of his Felix! Please stop beating me, sir! One of his kidneys had a problem and was surgically A group of good samaritans bought him a vehicle with which he I enquired about him and nothing seemed questionable. I have emailed you his medical reports. Sir, I can make him talk. I don't think he has a hand in Prakash's disappearance. So, where is Prakash? Sir, please don't hit me again! Varghese... When the accident took place was there any other vehicle behind yours? No sir. No. Are you sure? I am sure. A vehicle that came after Varghese left the scene... must have taken Prakash. The registration number is missing on its body. - Felix. - Sir. Varghese's vehicle crossed here at 8.49 pm. This is the vehicle that crossed afterwards. I think... this is the vehicle with the missing number. We'll probably find Prakash, here. Isn't this the only pickup stop after the junction? Yes sir. Do you recognise this vehicle? No sir. If you spot this vehicle -- Nobody knows anything about that vehicle. Okay, carry on. Okay sir. Bravo calling. We suspect a vehicle in regard to Prakash's case. A Mahindra pickup with the number missing on its side. If you spot such a vehicle, inform me. I hope the message is clear. Over. Brother! Brother! Get in quick. Please don't rush. Come on. Oh no! Quick! Brother! Go on! Brother! Wait for me! Brother! Please stop! Oh no! Brother please! Please, can you give me a ride? Please stop! Can you give me a ride? According to Subin's family he had classes until noon. When he didn't reach home even later, they looked for him at and realised he was missing since morning. That's when they reported at the station. Doesn't the boy use the school bus? The school bus broke down 2 days ago. Otherwise this is the What's the name of his school? De Paul school. Class? Seventh. Where does Subin live? His house is close by. I was out when you came to the station. I was caught up in a few things. Do you have any updates on my son? Don't worry. We are looking. Have you recieved any calls or messages after his No, nothing at all. Did he have any problems at home? No sir. Do you have any enemies? No sir. I need to see Subin's room. He doesn't have a room of his own. He sleeps with us. We have nobody other than him. If I leave home in search of my son, she will be all alone. I have no relatives here. I don't know what to do, sir. Please do not worry. We are on the look out. Okay. Is Subin's shoe size 6? Yes. Why? Nothing. I just wanted to know. - Felix? - Yes I hope you have Subin's photograph. I do. Get details of all buses that ran this route between 9 and 10 Okay. Show them Subin's photograph and find out if anyone has Similarly check auto stands and bus stands including vehicles going down the mountain pass. If you don't get any information... he studies in De Paul, right? Yes. Find out from the school if anyone knows a man named Do you think there is a link between both their I am not sure. It's just a probability. Both of them are connected to the school. One is a teacher. The other a student. Let's see. Yes, Felix? Subin has not boarded any bus on that route today. Do you know this person? Have you seen him at Teachers' meetings or cultural festivals? No sir. (Chruch chanting) Yes? Lijo's aunt is at St. Peter's Church parish hall enroute She is on a 10-day meditation. The meditation began 4 days ago but she arrived just now. I am a little suspicious. We are coming over now. Okay sir. Father, are Manu or Lijo among the people attending the Manu and Lijo? No one by that name here. Show him the photographs. Sir, both of them are here but those are not their names. Stop right there! Run Manu! It's locked! Beat them! Sir! Abhilash! Tell me Who hired you? Tell me! Who asked you to kill Mohan? Say it! Who hired you to kill Mohan? Sir... Who hired you to kill Mohan? Sir...Sir! Phone... Your phone is ringing. Hello? Hello? Hello? Sir! Sir! What happened? - Bring a vehicle around. - Okay, sir Bring a vehicle around quick! Is it necessary for all of us to be here? I have loads of work back home. What's the room number? Room number 11 His usual room. Did it happen during the investigation? Yes. Just like last time. Last time since he had fractures, someone had to be by his I always insisted he resign his job. Does he ever listen to me? Leena, do have a talk with the doctor. Okay. Not necessary. I'll have a word with the doctor. All of you go see him. Son? Mom... John! What did the doctor say? Is he all right? He is okay. He is sedated. Will he be discharged today? The doctor will let us know. Why do you look disturbed? Nothing. What did the doctor say? Will they let him go today? Not today. Why not? It will take a few days. He was hit on his ears with a tubelight. Shards of glass from the light have damaged his ear drum. It is infected and the doctor mentioned nerve damage. So? Not to worry. He might have... hearing loss in his right ear. He may have just about 20 percent hearing. Don't worry about it dear. Hearing aids will definitely improve his hearing. And... what about the left side? He will not be able to hear with his left ear. What?! What are you saying?! My son! You told me he was okay! Sir... How do you tell a father, right? Sir. John? John! Wake up John. You are all right now. Open you eyes. John! Hello John. Can you hear me? Can-you-hear-me-John? Slightly. Can-you-hear-me-now? I can't understand what you are saying. What about now? Can you hear me? I hear you very softly. John, owing to the blow with a tubelight... you have damaged nerves in your left ear. You have lost hearing in your left ear. I can't hear with my left? Yes, John. Your right ear can still hear about 20 percent. Once your bruises have healed, we will try a hearing aid. It will increase your healing ability to 30/35 percent. I can use a hearing aid? Yes. Hearing aid will help improve your hearing capacity. Do you understand me? No need to worry John. Everything will be allright. Doctor... I have no other problems, right? You have no problems. You are absolutely fine. I can't hear you. You have no other problems. You are totally fine. Can I rejoin work? It is better to take rest for a while. You take care. Okay? You can see him.

Sir, I have a question. Sir, please. What is it? 3 missing cases have been reported in Idukki. One Mr. Prakash, a student named Subin and Geeta, a They are all missing from the same police jurisdiction. But the Circle Inspector is off duty. What's happening? CI John was injured during an investigation and is off for a Right now the case is being handled by Sub Inspector Felix. They have not found even one person! Neither is anyone arrested on suspicion. We are doing our job. The missing persons will be found. All persons related to this case will be questioned. Will it take years? Within 2 weeks. Okay. Sir! This is the third missing case in Devikulam. Both earlier cases are still pending investigation. People are worried. Inspector John Luther investigating the case is presently off It shows the inability of our police force. Cameraman Jamal reporting from Idukki. Yes dad? I came to tell you something. What? Let's... Your phone is ringing. Pick it up. I'll call them back later. You talk to them. Felix? Sir, one more missing person is reported. I called you but didn't get through. Felix I will call you back. Sir... I will call you back. Okay sir. Tell me dad. Why are you talking so loudly? Talk softly. - Softly? - Yes. Like this? Softer. Now? Yes, that's fine. This is perfect. Shall we go for a drive? What? Shall we go on a drive? - Now? - Yes. Let's go. Son, I would like to... Mom wants you to resign from your job. And stay with us all the time. It would make her very happy. Not just her. Me too. When you are with us, we feel strong. Once you go... I mean, not that we can blame her. Everytime you go to work, we are worried. But no one lets you know. Every phone call at night scares us. Mom is really tensed. Can't you stay back with us? What's your decision? Dad, I... Listen, this is mom's opinion. Now, whatever maybe your decision, I have only one thing to I need my old son back. I miss arguing with you. Now, return to your job and concentrate on it. I will convince mom. Okay? What's it son? Tell me. It's been a long while... since you have addressed me as 'son'. Come. Are you okay, John? Sir, I am cancelling my leave and rejoining duty. Why are you in such a hurry? Sir? John, why-are-you-in-such-a-hurry? I understand your concern. But I need to investigate this case. Perhaps this is will be my last case. I know you are the perfect person to solve this case. But in this state... I know my weakness, sir. But I assure you it will not affect this case. Believe me. We have 2 weeks before the media starts questioning again. But we need a breakthrough before that. Go ahead. Thank you, sir. Sir. How are you, Rajan brother? I am fine sir. How are you feeling now? Sir. Sit down, Felix. I need information on the third missing case. Sir, the third missing person is Geeta. What? The third missing person is Geeta. 41 years... Okay, again. The third missing person is Geeta. 41 years old. She is from Pallivasal. Pallivasal? Yes. Her husband, Sudeep, reported her disappearace. Sudeep? Yes, Sudeep. They had no children despite 18 years of Owing to that, they had a prayer offering to the Malayattoor As part of the offering, she had to beg alms from 101 houses. 'Day before yesterday, when Sudeep was away at work' 'Geeta went out to visit houses' 'No one, including the neighbors, have seen her after that.' This is the case file. When did Sudeep register a complaint? 10:30 pm. When? 10:30 pm, sir. But it isn't mentioned here. Sir, the FIR was filed by Manoj. Please ask him to be more attentive. Okay sir. Ready Geeta's look out notice immediately. Insert in all newspapers tomorrow Including all social media and all local channels, along with our Okay sir. We don't have time, Felix. We need at least one person who has recognised Geeta. We need that tomorrow. Sure, sir. 'This lady, named Geeta, is missing since August 20th.' 'If anybody knows about her please inform to Devikulam 'Day before yesterday, when Sudeep was away at work' 'Geeta went out to visit houses.' 'Nobody has seen her after that.' Sir. What are the updates, Felix? We haven't recieved any calls until now. Do we have an update, Felix? We haven't recieved any calls until now, sir. Right. Has Geeta's lookout notice reached widely? Yes sir. All places have been covered. This is not an ordinary missing case. It is different. What are your reasons, sir? Reason? Yes. All the three missing persons in this case are not related to There is no relation between their age, gender or profession. It is a random selection. True. The first missing case has proved one thing. According to Varghese, he left Prakash on the road after the Prakash went missing after Varghese left the scene. That means Prakash was never a target. Prakash was only a victim of circumstance. Perhaps this is their nature of work. They don't look for prey. The prey comes to them That is why the selection is random. In that case, what could be their motive? No idea. But there is one similarity between the first two missing cases. Both of them went missing from isolated spots. The third person must have also gone missing from an isolated Sir, I have a doubt. Rajan brother, please speak louder. Sir, I have a doubt. Geeta was looking for prayer offerings. Yes. Why would she walk into an isolated spot? She should have been looking for a busy, residential area. As I mentioned, these are only my assumptions. From Pallivasal, Geeta could have covered houses within a In that case, what are the locations she could have visited? Chithirapuram, Pothamedu, Old Munnar, Attukad. Among these locations, secluded areas are... Hello? Your name, please. Location? What time did you see Geeta? Okay. Sir, location: Attukad. Rajan, bring out the vehicle. Sir. - Felix. - Okay sir. Vinod, right? Yes, sir. What time did Geeta come here? I wasn't here, sir. Only my wife and child saw her. This morning when we saw the lookout notice in the That's why I called you. Is your wife here? Yes sir. Please call her. Revathy... Come in, sir. Did Geeta travel by any vehicle? No, she was on foot. Okay. Was she alone? - Noted? - Yes. Yes, sir. What was the time? About 3 pm or 3:30 pm. What? About 3:30p m, sir. What did she say? She said she had an offering at Malayattoor Church... and was seeking alms. I went in and returned with some rice for her. Did she have anything in her hand? She had a big carry bag and perhaps a purse. Are there any houses nearby? About 8 - 10 houses, sir.
