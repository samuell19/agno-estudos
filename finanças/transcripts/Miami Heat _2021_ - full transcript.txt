Alright, so the Hammond, right? It's a... half night club, half cassino, but they're on Indian land and they do whatever they want. Run by a guy named Thomas Camp. I met him. Here's the thing: He's only a front. He comes up squeaky clean, but when you look deeper, It goes a lot further. It's run by a bunch of guys that have ties to criminal ties I'm talking about like human trafficking, arms dealing They took Julia. If you stay out of the gym, and start watching the news Yeah! They probably did take Julia. Shit happens like this in the news all the time! I don't know. Look, you've been in that place right? So, what do you think? A place where maybe she might be? I think she is inside. You've been in there, right? What if you had to pick a spot? Where do you think she might be? There was a side room in the back of the club. Some kind of key log. OK, the club was shut down when they built a new one next door, maybe there's a way to get from one side to the next my best guess, It would be the same way try to go from one side to the other But listen, check this shit out: Three years ago, right, a guy with a manifesto claim, right? He posted a manifesto claim. Are you paying a-fucking-tention He posted a manifesto claim, claiming that his daughter got kidnapped in New York. Wanna hear the funny part about it? It was financed by the same group of fucking Guys. He filed a fucking petition and fucking, guess what happened after that? And? Yeah - and. They found him shot and killed the next day he filed the petition with the city You know the police said? It was a home burglary. Bullshit. Two in the chest and one in the dome? Professionals. Yeah, professionals, I'd know it you'd know it, but why didn't the police figure it out? but it goes a lot deeper. These guys are powerful. Are You listening to me? They're powerful. And? So what?

You saw her? The girl Julia The girl, with the tatoo You know her? Yes. Where is she? I don't know, I fell asleep. They took her? Yes. 911 what is your emergency? I just killed 5 people. Maybe 6. At the Hammond, South Beach There are kidnapped girls chained up in the basement. They need medical attention. Do you understand? Five of our best men in Miami, killed. Two of our assets, taken. This puts extreme stress in our enterprise, not to mention the kind of money we have to pay the officials to bury the investigation. This is our target. I know this man. What do you know? His name is Yuri Gradenko He was Sambo champion, Ukraine and he fought in the War. Special Forces, over 300 confirmed kills. People talked about him like he was some kind of legend. After, I heard he was a personal bodyguard for the Secretary of Defense and the top crime boss in Moscow I thought the secretary defense was the top crime boss in Moscow Chen! What's he want? We took something of value from him. Her name is Julia, his daughter. His daughter? Yes, why? We're going to need a lot of bullets. Bro, what the fuck happened to laying low? What do you mean? The fucking story is out! It's all over the damn news. Some guy walks in to the Hammond and shoots all these gangsters! Great news. Sure it is. Did you tape it? Of course I fucking taped it. Very cool. Look, I've been doing work on these guys I've been doing research and the fucking shit I found This goes a little higher than we both think. I mean, I'm close to finding a name but the clients these guys deal with from senators to governors 20 years and no fucking prosecution We're going to need more muscle, bro. I don't need extra help... I just need... Where to find her. Find her? Great fucking answer, Tough guy. Easier said than done. So, the work I found out, it's the BC Holdings group, right? They own almost all the fucking property here. There's 30 different places she can be at. So the research that I found is probably port Lot 29, so they own this whole fucking lot, right? And there's a shipment coming in tommorrow. I'm almost certain from the research I've done that it should probably be there Yuri! Why didn't you tell me? I tried to tell you. You were too busy to care. So you're saying I don't care. I tried to call you and text you Yuri, where the fuck is she? I don't know. I just know. Where we can start. How's Brett? It's kind of embarrassing. You really could have hurt him. Sorry, it was too much. I forget he is a small guy... But- He has potential... If he drinks more milk. That's not funny, Yuri. He's a good man. What did you do to yourself? Mister Gradenko! Mister Gradenko! Come out. I'm waiting for you Mr. Gradenko Tell me something Why do you use protection? Excuse me, Sir. Protection? Well, I guess when when with a woman, I sometimes- No, not that type of protection. I'm talking about real protection. Men, guns, a place like this Why don't you use it for yourself? Because I never needed it. That's right. Because the only people who want to kill you want to kill me. You don't need protection because you are the protection. I'm not sure I follow. I'm trying to make you comprehend the importance of what you do. If I would be killed, who's to blame? Well... Me. Yes but I also want you to comprehend the importance of who you are. If I will get killed, what would you do? I would feel horrible, Sir. I didn't ask you how you would feel, I said, what do you do? I just don't want to imagine that. But you have imagined it, haven't you? You take over. Who else is going to head this empire? All of this: yours. But that's OK, it's OK. I just want you to be honest with me. You have imagined it, haven't you? Yes, I have imagined it. In time my friend, in time. But for now, you protect me. Looks like you made a lot of enemies lately. Special forces. Tell me: How do you get out from situation like this? Rule number 1 always bring back up. Back up? Fuck you Gradenko You're dead. Oh God, my neck hurts. Sleeping in car is not easy. Are you sure? You trust your friend? Yes, we work together. If there's anyone good left at that Police Department. Trust me, it's him. Let's get out of here. Yawn! Maybe we should pick up some mouthwash along the way. Mr. Tanaka, nice meeting you. Very happy to see you here. I'm about to make you even happier. Perfect, let's go inside and enjoy the show. Pure beauty latinas. Where else you can find it? But Miami. My clientele is going to be very happy. This is a big trend right now. That's why you come to me. Because I always deliver the best.
