I major in history. Tyler, you know anything about engines? I don't even know where the engine is. I can feel something. -I... I think it's a clasp. -Good work, dude. We need to move him so we can get under the seat. We're gonna move you, okay? Guys, we need help. Come on. -[Tom] Okay, go. -[Nat] W-w-w-wait! -Hold on to me, alright? -Yeah. -You gotta hold on. -[Nat] You got him? -[Tom] Hold on to us. -[Nat] Easy. [Tom] Slow. Slow, Greg. Slow.

No. Fuck! Alright, try starting it again. [engine stalling] [Greg yells in pain] We need to get him back up. [Greg groaning] [Greg] Pull me up! Three, two, one... [Greg screams, panting] [Milly sobbing] [Greg breathing heavily] [engine switched off] [clattering] Animales. It's, like, seven in the morning. No one's out and about. You got any other bright ideas? I was just saying. Well, don't. Cos every time I listen to you, I end up in trouble. [sighs] [Tom] We're drifting out. [Nat] What? There was a church tower on the left and I can't see it anymore. [Tom] The tide must've changed. We have to get signal on Milly's cell. - [Greg] Tom? -Shh, dude, someone's coming. No... I'm so thirsty. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! Greg, you can't drink the water. -Please. Please. -Dude, I'm sorry. [Greg] Okay. It's okay. It's gonna be okay, I promise. -[Greg] Okay. -[Tom] I'll get us out of here. [Greg] Okay. Okay.

I... -[Tyler] Shit! -[Tom] Look what you've done! -[Nat] What I've done?! [Tom] Yes, you! -[Nat] I trusted you! -[Tom] Nat, I was drunk! -[Nat] Cheaters! [muffled shouting] -Asshole! -No, no, no, no, no, no, no. You are such an asshole. -Nat, I am sorry. -Fuck you. [ominous music] [Tyler] He's never gonna get it. [Tyler] God, where is he? [screams] -No! Whoa, whoa! -[Greg] What was that? -[Greg] Milly?! -Shit. [gasps, coughs] Sorry. You dragged me under! You asshole! Didn't think I was gonna make it. Here's the cell. [Greg] Asshole. [foreboding music] [engine stalling] Natty, I'm so, so, so sorry. I was so drunk. So was he. He said you two weren't getting on and that's why... That's why he what? I may not be the only one. Did anyone notice that dude in the boat? -What? -We passed him on the way out. He was on some kind of sailboat. I don't think he was moving very fast, so he might still be out there between us and the shore. So why can't we see him? I don't know. But I think I'm gonna take my chance. We have to stick together till someone comes. And what if no-one comes? Look, I can ace this. I can do this. Tyler, no. You took a bang to the head. That might be a problem if there was something inside of there. You don't have to do this. -Please. -I reckon I do. Thank you. [Milly] Here. I got it when I was 14 at the Platte County Fair from the guy running the bumper cars. [chuckles] That all he gave you? [Tyler] That's so cool. [chuckles] [Tom] Bro. Kick ass. Dude. [grunts] You got this. Good luck, Tyler. Y'all just hang tight now, alright? No partying when I'm gone. [all chuckle lightly] - [Tom] Go, Tyler! -[Milly] Whoo! -[Tom] Go on, Tyler! -[Nat] Go, Tyler! -[Tom] Go, Ty! -[all shouting] Go, Tyler! [Milly] Whoo-ooh! [Greg] Shit. [Nat] Don't worry, he's gonna make it. He's got this. -Are you okay? -Yeah. [sinister music] Fuck. Shark. Shark! What? Tyler! Shark! -Tyler! -Tyler! [all yelling] Get out of the water, shark! -Where did it go? -[Nat] Uh... You sure it was a shark? Shit, I don't know! What does a shark even look like?! [all screaming] [Tom] Let me up! [all screaming] [muffled shouting] [gasps] [panting] [whimpers] [muffled shouting] [Tom] Greg! Greg! -I can't swim! Ah! - [Tom] Milly! [Milly] We need to get out the water! [Milly gasping] [Tom] Milly! [muffled shouting] -[Tom] I'm coming! Milly! -[Nat] Greg! [shrieks] I felt something on my leg! [Tom] Milly!

[Milly whimpering] [Nat] Tom! -[Greg groaning] -We need help! [Tom] Nat, stay there. I'm coming. [breathing rapidly] -Please, God. -[panting] [screams in pain] [all screaming] Nat! [screaming] It's dragging both of you! You have to let go! [screaming] [Tom] Nat! [Nat screaming] [Tom] Nat! [Greg groaning] [sobbing] [crying] [gasps, coughs] -[Tom] Nat! -[Milly] Oh, my God! [Milly] Oh, my God, come on, come on! -Keep going, keep going! -Keep swimming! [Milly] Come on, come on! You can do it, you can do it! [Milly] Come on! [Tom] Grab my hand. -[Milly] Tom, help her. - [Tom] I got her. [Nat grunting] -[Nat coughs] -I thought we lost you. [panting] You're safe now, okay? You're safe now. [Milly] Just breathe. -[Nat panting] - [Milly] Nice and slow. [Milly] It's okay, Nat. [Milly] It's okay. [Nat coughing] Is there any way that... Greg, he maybe... [sobs] [sobbing] [Milly sobbing] Gran tiburon blanco. What? The beggar... in the town. He told me he had lost his legs in a shark attack. He said it was a great white. [laughs] Anything? No. What if no-one comes? What if Tyler can't find the boat? Milly, shut up! The shark gets him and then comes back for us. Milly, shut the fuck up! I'm such an asshole, you're right. How many others were there? How many besides Milly? Two. I'm sorry. My mom and dad got you down as a stand-up guy. Real son-in-law material. And Billy, he hero worships you. I mean, why are you even still with me? Huh? Cos I love you. Tom, the only person you love is yourself. Okay. So, maybe you should start trying to show yourself some love. And stop doing shit for people and trying to please everyone. [Nat] It's called showing respect. It's called being a doormat and that's why people walk all over you. [grunts] Hey! Hey! Over here! [music playing on radio] Hey! Right here! [in distance] Hey! Hey! [sinister music] [panting] [panting] [gasps] [sinister music] [chomp] [gasps, crying] [muffled] No! No! [cries] No, no. No...

[Milly] Someone's gotta be missing us? Right? Someone cares? I just wanna go home. I hope you can forgive me. I think I've found something. [Tom grunts] [Tom] I don't know what I'm looking at. [Nat] Don't. If you wanna feel even more dehydrated, be my guest. Try, uh... Try licking your lips. [engine stalling] [engine ticking] [ominous music] [Nat] It's 6:30. It'll be dark soon. [Tom] Least we'll be out of the sun. [Milly] We were supposed to be home by now. [Milly] The airline, they'll know we're missing, right? [Milly] I don't wanna be out here in the dark. [shivering] So cold. -[splash] -[gasps] What the fuck was that? I don't know. -[splash] -[all gasp] Do sharks hunt at night? I guess... it depends if they're hungry or not. [Tom] This thing's fucking with us. [Nat] There's a light. [gasps] Guys! Is that a boat?! Guys, there's a light. Over there! -Hello?! -Hey! Somebody?! Hey! -Hey, over here! -We're over here! -What is it? What is it? -That is a boat over there. -Hey! Dude! -We're stuck! -Hey! -Over here! -Over here! -I don't think they can hear us. Use the torch! The torch on your cell phone so they can see us in the dark! Somebody, help. Please! Hey, hey! Over here! What are they doing? Give me the phone. Hello?! -Hey! -Hey! -This way! -Help! -What are they waiting for? -Don't know. How far is it? 50, maybe 60 yards. You think you can swim it? What? One of us is gonna have to swim over to the boat. [breathing heavily] [Tom groans] [Milly whimpering] [breathing heavily] You can do this. -[splashing] -[Milly shrieking] I can't, I can't. I can't. I'm sorry. [Tom panting] Sorry. [Tom] I'm sorry. Nat? [Tom] You don't have to. Nat. [breathing heavily] You see anything... move in the water... ...you holler. [Milly gasping] [Milly gasps] [grunts] [Nat] Are you okay? What happened here?

[Nat whimpering] [Tom] It's okay. -Milly, come on, help. -Give me your hand, here. [whimpering] Did it bite you? There was... [breathing heavily] -Tell me. -There was a man... ...in the water in a life vest. He must've been a sailor. [gasps] I think the shark must've wrecked his boat and killed him. [sobs] -[gasps] -Oh, what is it?! Oh, geez. Holy fuck. If we sit here and do nothing, we're shark bait. If we don't die of dehydration first. There's some driftwood. You think we can reach it? [grunting, gasps] Got it! Got it. For you. There's a life vest. What if I fall in the water? I can only do the doggy paddle. [Nat] Okay. Now hold it right there. Holy shit. Who's doing this? [Tom vomits] [Tom retches] [Tom groaning] [Tom grunts] [grunts] [groans] Ew, ew, ew, ew. Thanks. [breathing heavily] Are you sure it's this way? Uh, I can't tell. [Milly grunts] Come on, back there.

Like, real bad. So why would it even bother coming back? Cos now it's pissed as well as hungry. [Tom grunts] We gotta get this thing started. We all get up, real slow. We already did that. There's no way I'm going into the God damn water. We have to try. How are we gonna do this? [grunting] You go the left, I'll go to the right. -[Tom grunts] -Hold on to each other, keep ourselves from falling into the sea. [Nat] Whoa, whoa! We have to go at the same time. Okay? Yeah. Yeah.
