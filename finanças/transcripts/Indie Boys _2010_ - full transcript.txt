Can you do it? Can you? It's been ten years since Liwayway Films closed. No one wants to watch the movies we used to make. This is what people want to watch now. A sure money earner. Are you going to gamble your last money on this kind of film? Everyday you come here nagging me for a project. A film. Well this is the kind of film my money can afford. My last gamble. Thank you. It's been ten years since my last film. A director with no film. I'm tired of bumming around. I'm ashamed. I'm ashamed of myself. I'm willing to do even a lewd film. Somehow people still respect my name. I know I owe you. You made me rich with the movies you made before. Let's see... Let's see if we get lucky. Let's ride the trend. Thank you. "My Tears Have Run Out" Hello. Our project is pushing through. I'll meet you in the coffee shop. Can I trust you to make sure the news reporters will write about my film? And are you sure people will come to our audition? Don't worry. That's the same thing we did for the movie "Lick". Oh my! So many came to audition and I was also able to lick so many of them. Flirt! This is work, okay? Wow, you're so clean! Hello! How can you resist? When there's so many naked guys in front of you! And with a flirt like you? And who is this? Hey! He's mine, okay? Do you want to be an actor? Yes! Can I? Definitely! Are you willing to do naked scenes? Hey, wait! He's still a minor! I'll recommend someone else, okay? Who? Hi, my name is George, 18 years old, med school student from Mandaluyong. I can sing. I can dance. I'm willing to go naked. My parents are okay with it. He can't speak properly. What kind of recommendation is that? Who cares! He can sustain a long hard on! I'm serious! If this movie isn't successful, it's over! My career is dead. Wait... how about Kenner? How much are we talking about? I don't do frontal nudity. When will this be shown? How much is your offer? Is that the last price? How many times is the frontal? My mom will see my dick on screen. I don't think I can do it. Is that the last price? How about 3500 pesos? I live in Laguna. The 500 will be for my transportation. No. Not him! He's not willing to go on a date. So who? No famous actor will show his dick for such a low budget. How about Jonathan Mendez? Isn't he old? 32? Old? Ah Lester David. Admit it! You were dating! Small dick. You won't see anything in the frontal. You're so choosy! Martin Nieves. In rehab! Really? Who else? Here! Patrick Suarez. Also known as Patricia now! Here's the plan. Have reporters write about the movie and our auditions. So many will come. Are you sure you can't? Hello! We have an exclusive contract. Money, please Hello, who's this? Really? When's the shooting? I'll tell him to include you. I'll handle it. He's my boyfriend. Okay. Bye. What are you doing here? I heard you have a new film. News travels fast. So what's it about? Am I a part of the movie? Everyone knows that a Leonardo David film is not complete without a Rolando Jimenez. Go home! You're drunk! Your wife is looking for you. Hey... you're my only wife. Ex-wife! You left me remember? When I lost my job. When I didn't have any money. Of course. I have bills to pay. I have four kids. We'd starve! That's why you had an affair with make-up artist, Lolit? Even legman, Rene? Who in showbiz hasn't tasted you? I gave them a chance but I gave my heart only to you. Go home! I need to finish this script before Liwayway Films changes their mind. Go home! Why won't you let me join the director's movie? I know that gay director, okay? He's a flirt. And the movie doesn't even look good. You'll just waste your debut. When will I star in a movie? My mom in the province keeps asking me. She thinks my stories of being an actor are make-believe! Can you even act? Don't! Please don't! Please have mercy. I'm still young. I still have a bright future ahead of me. Why don't you just be a porn star? And imagination flowed... when once it was stagnant. Was hindered from flowing... continuously flowing like musical measure... Once... Twice... Many pages my imagination granted. I love you, but I love myself more. If I let you love me more than how I love you that won't be true love. Come back when you've learned to love yourself more. You still have it. Like a script factory... so fast! How many hours did it take you? It seems you used all the figures of speech. I was just inspired. Beautiful title. "R-18 For Adults Only" I want it explicit okay? But why "R-18"? That's Ronald's story. An 18 year old boy who hooked up with a director to enter showbiz. True to life story? A bit. You're right. You included a female character. A female character with naked scenes. Louie said it's safer with a female character, so that gay men who aren't out can use the girl as an excuse to watch the film. And gay guys can score because guys will be aroused. Do you already have a lead actor? Tomorrow you will get the money. But like I said you will need to be thrift. What you save, is yours. But if you go over budget that's on you. You pay for it. When is the audition? We are doing a gay film. We need good acting. No attitude. You must be above 18 years old. Must not be shy. Must be bold. Must have a big dick. Our budget is only 4000 pesos. Four days shooting for a total of 16000 pesos. After this movie, you will be famous. Producers and directors will want to get you for their soaps. You will have TV guestings. Whatever your dreams are, you can achieve it once you make a name for yourself. Let's start the audition. Who's my partner? Maui or Gwen Garci? (famous actress) Kid, your partner is a man. Yes, I'm open to having relations with a gay man. Is it wrong? Is it wrong? What can I do? What can I do? I was alone. He approached me. He approached me. He touched me. I went with the flow. I went with the flow. I trusted. I trusted. Can you blame me? Wasn't it like the first time you tasted me? I don't go with gay guys but you forced me. I don't go with gay guys but you forced me. So what do you want me to do? Can you blame me? Yes, I had relations with a gay man. Is it wrong? I was alone. He approached me. I went with the flow. I agreed. I trusted. Wasn't it like the first time you tasted me? I don't go with gay gays but you forced me. So what do you want me to do? Can you touch another guy? Kiss another guy? Exchange saliva? Hold a guy's dick on camera? Why are you sad? You can't do it? I'll be honest with you. I see potential in you. But if you don't have the guts to do it I can't cast you. I need this project. I need this to succeed. I can do it. I will do my best. Are you sure? Can you display emotions during the shoot? I can. I've been through a lot. I've been through a lot. I had many experiences. I was a macho dancer for one year. My body was feasted upon for one year. I must have knocked on more than 80 doors so my family can eat. I'm like a salesman offering myself I joined every bikini contest. But I was never lucky. There's always someone better more handsome who wins. I work in a lot of massage parlors. I used different names... different stories about my life. Even my sister profited from me. Sold my body to gay guys. No matter how tired... I go on. Just so we have money to buy food. I've already grown numb. I'm like a battery. Once I start, I go on. No stopping until it ends. Your good looks are waste if we don't profit from it. You don't lose anything. Gays give good head anyway. Here. Go buy something. Herman's coming tomorrow. He said he misses you. Why did you agree? We need the money. Like now. I'll do anything because I need to. You can do everything I said? Even the things you didn't say. I'll do it. Wait for our decision on Sunday. You'll know by Sunday if you got the role. We don't need to wait 'til Sunday. Where do you live? Just wait for our decision on Sunday. Did you like my story? You're so gullible. Not everything is true of course. Big percent? 60% 70% Even I don't know the truth anymore. My life is a movie. I'm the hero so there's a bit of drama. They won't know the truth anyway. Just enjoy the story I'm telling. Do you already have a project for me? I'm fine with any role. Any talent fee will do. Please bro... Here... 400,000 pesos. Spend it carefully. And buy some new clothes. Your cell phone is old. Change it. I still have some savings left. I do term papers and thesis as a side hustle. I hope that's a blockbuster and we earn a lot of money. I'll do my best. I'll do my best. Do you have a lead actor? I'm considering someone already. But I'm considering this new that just auditioned. A student. And who's that? Your boyfriend? Hi, I am Ryan I'm 18 years old. I like play basketball. I like to swim. I like to dance. I like to sing. And I love you. Yes, I had relations with a gay man. Is it wrong? So what do you want me to do? I was alone. He approached me. He touched me. I went with the flow. I trusted. Can you blame me? Wasn't it like the first time you tasted me? I don't go with gay guys but you forced me. I went with the flow. So what do you want me to do? What's your background? How can you do the sensitive scenes? Do you have any experience with a gay man? One question at a time please. First... I've had acting experience in soaps. Passerby, friend of the friend of the lead Like that. As for the sensitive scenes, you have to shoot them creatively, right? The censors won't allow it. Experience with a gay man? I think... I'll have my first after this. What's your background? Where do you live? Where's your family? I left my parents. I just live with my friends now. My parents don't care anymore. Are you sure you can do the movie? Didn't I pass your audition? Bro, still no news? Anything... What are you doing here? Didn't we agree to meet? No, we didn't. Didn't I tell you to wait 'til Sunday for the decision? If I need to audition in your bed, I will do it. I'll do it. Don't make a scene here. I'm respected here. I'm a good actor. I fit the role. Just tell me what I need to do. This is my eighth audition. Have pity on me. Have pity. Thank you. Just tell me the kind of acting you need when we shoot. I just need a break. I know you'll guide me. When's the shooting? You weren't chosen for the role. What did you say? I said you weren't chosen for the role. I considered you but someone fit the role better. Fresh and young... Bastard! You fooled me! You're like all the gay men who just wants my dick! Hey I didn't force you. You're the one who wants this. You fooled me! You made me think I had the chance! Rejected again! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! So shameful! Can't do anything now. I gave away a free blowjob again. Stupid! Stupid! Good thing he didn't kill you. It would have made a great headline. What a great publicity for your comeback movie! Fool! What a negative publicity. I'll look like a maniac. You're not? Was he delicious? Him? Yes. Just give him a supporting role. He wants a leading role. Here. Have it laminated. Can't we have his contract terminated? Can you leave him alone? Do I have to threaten you with negative publicity? He's such a waste. He's so handsome. Like a young Raymond. Wait... Where's that Raymond now? Here I am. Back inside the mouths of gay hairdressers. Shit! They're really starting the shoot. And I'm not included. Shit! Is he the one? Fresh right? He has potential. Have you finished your rehearsals? Finished! He's really good. Really good. Don't I have any other purpose but to make you happy? I'm so tired. You? When will you get tired using me? Pack up! Is that you? It's me and I don't have any money to buy your medicines. Shit! Why don't you just die?! Shit! You're the misfortune in my life! I'm doing everything but nothing! I don't know what you're talking about. I auditioned and begged for the role. I was taken advantage of again! Give up your dream of becoming an actor. And where will I go? To those gay hairdressers? Is my dick for hairdressers? Go find another job. Has my acting improved, sis? Good, right? Ryan's very good! Yes. My dick might get hard. What are you doing here? You started shooting already. Don't you have any plans of including me? You're already included in all my films. Maybe not this one. But I'm your lucky charm. My movies make money because I'm a good director. Not because of a bit player like you. Bit player??? Fuck you! After you used me? You think I want to work with you again??? Your career is over! A has-been! Only reason you got the project was because you begged. Why? What kind of film is that? Gay film? Full of nudity? I don't need you! I don't need your trashy film! Wow, what a scene! Slapping, spitting... Just like Boyet and Sister V's movie! The nerve! He called me a has-been! Don't get angry, okay? In fairness, Lando is right. You've been gone a long time. And wasn't your last film a flop? Hello? Are you really my friend? Of course! That's why I'm telling you the truth! The press asked me why I accepted the PR job for your movie. When you're a has-been. Fuck them! When this movie comes out, they'll see. Let's see if they call me a has-been. There are many stories in show business. Some happy, some sad, some hopefully, some depressing. Can you tell the director to include me in your film? Any role. Tell him I'll massage him later. Bro he doesn't like massages. He likes young boys. You think it's all fun in showbiz? Glitzy? If people only know what happens behind the camera. They'll be disgusted. It's disgusting. But even so, you learn to take it. What are you doing here? Aren't you going to leave me alone??? Let's get back together. Don't have anywhere to go. Nothing's going to happen to us. Go back to your family. Find someone else! What do you mean you won't show your dick? I casted you because you said you would. It's our last shooting day! Don't give me attitude. You asked me to go naked in the motel. You want me to do it here too? Don't make a scene here. Why? Are you afraid they'll know? You tasted me before you gave me the role. Do you think they don't know what you did to me? Be quiet! You agreed to get naked. You'd kiss another guy. We did all that without a camera, right? Don't do this to me. I'm not. Oh yeah... I lied to you about one thing that I was 18 already. I'm only 17 years old. A minor. Do you want a case? Do you want to go to jail? Are you still insisting I get naked in this movie? Or should I go straight to the police? You should have shot all the bold scenes first! I didn't want to shock the kid. Shock the kid? Now you're the one shocked! What are you going to do now? What are we going to do now? I'll find a way. Stupid kid! I'm sure someone influenced him. That's why he changed his mind. What about my 400,000 pesos now? You can't control your libido. That's why. You can't keep your hands off them. You did the right thing! It's a good thing you fooled them into thinking you're 18. I just followed what you said. Of course, you're my manager. I'll follow your career plans. Of course! Imagine if you show your dick on your first movie, what will you show after? The director was so pale awhile ago. You should keep your distance. The only reason I was kind to him was because he gave me my first film. By the way, where's my new cell phone? I don't know but I think there's still a shred of luck in me. Somehow, my trust wasn't wasted. I still benefitted from my dick. My brother is not here. He's still finding money for my medicine. Are you his friend? I'll just go. Have patience with my brother. I'm sure he's told you many wild stories. Yes, a lot. Even about you. I know. I'm bad? War freak? Pimp? He invents things to get people to pity him. I can't blame him. Our parents left us when we were young. I'll go ahead. I have things to do. Ok. I'll just tell him that you came by. Who are you? Please tell him, Director Leo. My brother's going to be an actor? I can do it too. I can be the talkative cripple. A crippled friend. I can do it. My life is full of drama. Can I? Any role will do. You already owe me so much money. What do you mean I owe you? Did you use my body for free? What are you talking about? Fucking jerk! You have so many saints here but I'm the one you kneel to. Give me some peace! You know I have nowhere else to go. Help me please. Don't just throw me aside. It wasn't me who threw you away I was the one you threw away! We're over! You're used to selling your body, right? Leave! We're over! Let me go! Fuck you! I know... I'm crippled. So what? At least my heart isn't crippled. Maybe it's your dick that's crippled. Do you want me to... massage it? My heart doesn't need your help. Will the director like my acting? I heard you went to my house. Why? Do I get naked again? No. Let's make things right. What do you mean? I'll make you the lead actor. You'll have the spotlight. You'll have top billing. You'll be the face of the film. And what will it cost me? I got it already, right? Help me. Let's help each other. Wow! This is my moment! This is my moment! I don't remember everything I was asked to do. What I did... Bent down. Opened wide. Kissed people I don't know. Kissed people with bad breath. It's okay. I'm used to these situations. The only difference is there's a camera. I know... I'm just a guy. You just want my dick. But until the day you die, you will never forget the pleasure you got from my dick. It's good. Better when we re-edited it and added Raymond. Thank you. Burn me two copies for the censor board. I'll get it tomorrow. I'll go ahead. Where you, bro? I've been editing dicks all day. Yuck! What do you need from me? Maybe you're the one who needs me. Lando leave me alone. We're over. You're so sure of yourself, bastard! Found someone younger? Is his dick bigger? Is he better than me? Stop it! You're like an old movie. You're old! You're old! Old? Old? "Director Killed by Ex-Lover" I know... I'm just a guy. You just want my dick. But until the day you die, you will never forget the pleasure you got from my dick. "The last film of Leonardo David 1974-2010" Beautiful. Sad... He won't get to see the crowds that will come to watch his film. What's your plan? Plan? Go to TV guestings. Show how sad you are. Cry on camera. Tell people how great this film is. I'm sure this will earn. Blockbuster hit! If that happens, I'll give you a bonus! And I'll include you in my next film. This is what you do. Dear Filipino movie goers, don't forget to watch the film of our dearly departed director. Have pity on him. This is his last masterpiece. You won't regret it. It's so good. I could not believe it. Thank you so much. How was it? That's how you should do it. It's a pity what happened to Director Leo. Actually, he was my friend. His manager was close to my manager. No. I'm not a part of the film. I'm just his friend. His manager was close to my manager. How sad. He was excited about his new movie. He was absent for a long time. He wanted to make a movie again. When Liwayway Films gave him the chance to make an indie movie, he told me right away. He was so excited. Who knew it would be his last film. My friend... By the way, I have a special participation in this film. Please watch. He was kind. He helped me with my scenes. He never scolded me. I was like his son. I'll never forget him. He was so kind to me. I don't know how to react to his death. Fucking bastard. Bastard! He took advantage of me. Molested me. He threatened to reveal my past if I don't do what he wants. I know... I'm an indecent man I'm gay for pay. Despite all that I'm still a person. Fucking bastard. He did so many things to me. He deserves to die. He deserves to die! Pack up. We're leaving! What happened? Looks like this is what we've been waiting for. Sis don't ask too many questions. What's important is People are finally going to know me. I'll be famous. Rich. No going back to those gay hairdresser. This is what I've been waiting for. We're so close. We're going to be rich. Just a little more patience. Can you do it? Can you do that kind of movie? Can you find a lead actor? Yes, I'm open to having relations with a gay man. Is it wrong? What can I do? I was alone. He approached me. Wasn't it like the first time you tasted me? I don't go with gay guys but you forced me. I went with the flow. I trusted. Can you blame me? 00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:00,600 (Indie Boys)
