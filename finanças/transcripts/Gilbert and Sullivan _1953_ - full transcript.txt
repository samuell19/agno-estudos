Subtitles by Seglora There must be so many much more amusing ways of spending Saturday afternoon than at Crystal Palace That is precisely why Papa insisted on the Crystal Palace Grace,it's really all your part for allowing Mr Sullivan to fall in love with you Everyone agrees that one day Mr Sullivan will be our greatest composer of music I'm proud to be inspired his affection You can wake up now,Willie Fine composition,Gilbert You should make a point of hearing it sometime I shall tell Sullivan,it's damned sprightliness to another world I was so proud of you,Arthur,so very proud When can we be married? -One day -Soon? Your old professor from Leipzig was enraptured There are no heights of music, which you may not scale,he says How soon? You were right,great music for me, will you not Arthur? Grace Oratories,symphonies,serenades and grand,grand opera When can we be married? Soon,I said soon Arthur,what is Mr,what was his name, Mr Gilbert doing at the Crystal Palace? Gilbert? I invited him there, you know And the man with him? D'Oyly Carte Another theatrical person? Arthur,you are not working again with Mr Gilbert? -Well -Arthur! Grace I wish I could make you understand, what am I beside you? A nobody Only the son of poor Lambeth bandmaster,with nothing but my music I freely admit I'll turn my hand to anything to make our marriage possible last week if you must know,I I sold half a dozen pot boilers to Mr Chapel at five guineas a time Pot boilers? Grace What is it? And I thought I was helping you You are,you know you are,it was for you that I wrote my oratorio And from all the stories in the Holy Script,which did you choose? The Prodigal Son Unless I have the means how can I ever approach your father? When you worked with Mr Gilbert once before,was it successful? I admit "Thespis" didn't do too well How will another failure help you? -But D'Oyly Carte think.. -Darling,Arthur If you really love me you'll go your theatrical friends this very night and tell them that you are sorry but you cannot compose their comic operetta How can I? I've already started it You were taught by the pupil of Beethoven himself You must learn to dedicate yourself to your art religiously,like the great masters the theatre,dearest Arthur, is not your world Grace,are you there? Yes,Papa Our guests are waiting for you,my dear Then I must go them,Papa,must I not? I'm afraid Mr Sullivan has to leave us He has a very important appointment Curious girl,Grace, do you understand her,Mr Sullivan? Well,Sir I. I don't Never else her mother either Indeed,Sir? In a state of mutual misunderstanding, all girls She seems to think you are a genius,are you? Well,Sir.. I hope not, a genius so often has to be supported,by his father in law But,Sir,I wouldn't dream of approaching you unless I have the means of supporting Grace Assure me you have means that there was an early prospect of let's be exceedingly modest, a thousand a year? Thousand a year? There you are my boy I hope you are not going to feel that you are not welcome here you are a brilliant fellow they've told me Though I must say I feel happier if you were on the stock exchange,eh Well,consider it,my boy,consider it Think it over -Good Night,Sir -Good Night,Mr Sullivan Mind you Two thousands a year would be better Sullivan,my dear chap,congratulations, congratulations Your first batch of music is really superb Gilbert and I are absolutely delighted, aren't we,Gilbert? We are indeed, and I know what I'm talking about I once succeeded in distinguishing “Pop! Goes the Weasel” from "God Save the Queen" The point is can you be ready with the rest by the next week I'm sorry,gentlemen,but I can't do it We have to make the week after then No,you misunderstand me Well,if you can manage it earlier, I'm presenting it on the 25th What? With a new opera by Offenbach Stiff competition,you know Offenbach we have to try to beat the Frenchmen at his own game I'm sure you will What Offenbach can do,Sullivan can do Offenbach made a fortune Yes,what I mean why shouldn't the two of you start a new school of English light opera Why not,indeed,I have no personal objections to making a fortune Gilbert? Speaking of Offenbach How much would you say he makes a year? I think of thousand out of London alone Thousand a year? Probably two Two thousands a year I mark that Allegro vivace should go faster like this,let me show you Wait,please I felt sure you would come,Mr Sullivan, but I had nearly giving you up There were no cabs in this rain,where is Grace? It's no use,Mr Sullivan,I assure you Lettie,is that Mr Sullivan? Grace,what happened? Why did you leave like that,Grace, without a word? There was no chance to explain I could forgive you for squandering your gifts on triviality it was wrong and wicked yet I did forgive you,but when I saw you glory in it Grace,I beg you I watched you conducting your little operetta,I saw you afterwards out there bobbing and bowing,and,also I could scarcely believe my eyes I saw that you were proud of it, you were in your element you liked it,Arthur,you actually liked it Grace,Grace,Grace You must listen to me,Grace Well,well,Good Evening Mr Sullivan, or is it Good Night Good Morning to be absolutely accurate Sir,I must talk to Grace at once It will serve no purpose Sir, she has just declared that she'll never forgive me What more my boy,she undoubtedly means it So you don't understand Nor do you therefore we are on equal terms Sir,I must have one last word with her Take my advice,my boy, have one last word with me instead I got a very good idea you sit yourself down there,I won't be a moment,don't run away "You soon get used to the looks and a very nice girl you find her She may very well pass for forty-three in the dust with the light behind her" Capital little tune arioso, my boy, hold that moment will you? Thank you "I'm a judge,and a good judge too" So I am hopeful,if nothing else I fear you are right,Sir, I don't understand her I suppose she wanted a Bach and found he was only a Offenbach No pun intended Here is to you,Mr Sullivan Your health,Sir If it is any consolation to you,Arthur I suppose I can call you Arthur now when we are not to be related if there is any consolation to you I think you might have had a lucky escape,you know How can you say that,Sir? Well,genius,Arthur,isn't the delicate plant Grace thinks oh no,no,no,it's as hardy as a Jerusalem artichoke Grace would have begun by mothering but ended by smothering It is curious situation,isn't it,Sir? We are a curious slavery,my boy Grace wanted me because of my art you rejected me because I have no means now she won't have me and I suppose you would Like a shot,like a shot as you garb wherever marrying me,my boy there is only one thing to do What's that ,Sir? Finish the bottle It is proposed that Gilbert and Sullivan shall enter into partnership with D'Oyly Carte,Sullivan and Gilbert's fees to be four guineas per performance for each opera the profits to be equally divided How's that? I don't think we need a formal contract? No,no,no,of course here we are Are we too early? No,of course not Mrs D'Oyly To seal the contract Happy Thoughts,Mrs Gilbert Thank you I remember gentlemen you mustn't work me too hard,this is only a side line Of course,the college of music must come first We are very lucky to have got you at all Here's to the partnership Come on, Grossmith ,let's give it a try Come on,Sir,we'll promise Go on,say something,Sullivan Oh,no words by Gilbert Shall I tell them why we are going to America? Why not At this moment in New York eight pirate companies are presenting our HMS Pinafore In Philadelphia is presenting a German version Chicago is presenting a negro version No one is presenting our version And what's makes even more heartbreaking is no one is paying us a penny for presenting any version Shame Are we going to take this shocking state of affairs lying down? Are we? No What are we going to do? To begin with we are taking our own company of Pinafore over there I knew there was some reason why we were going the United States And then my dear Gilbert,you may recall we are going to do something that we've never done before We are writing an entirely new comic opera Which is to have its opening night in New York,instead of London What's it about? Pirates,Madame Let's hear something from it I beg you pardon,Captain Sing us a song from the new opera What as? You brought it upon yourself, you know you really don't know my voice is like Did he know he had one? Go to your piano,my dear fellow Ladies and Gentlemen in our new piece we introduce the no warm but hither to neglected figure,the British policeman Girls,girls,quiet,please Mr D'Oyly Carte -Good Evening,ladies -Good Evening Mind the intrusion but I simply had to come and thank you personally for your wonderful contribution to our great success Are you all looking forward for going home to your mama? It should be lovely getting back to London and the old theatre The old theatre Ladies.Don't you think that the opera comique is a little small for the Gilbert & Sullivan company now? Why? Are we going to move,Mr D'Oyly Carte? I can't tell you that ,it's a secret All right,between the seventeen of us,you won't say a word? No I'm sure you won't I have bought a site in the Strand for a completely new building within a couple of years and a couple of operas,we shall have our very own theatre The Savoy -Good Night,ladies -Good Night And a very happy trip over I know I can rely absolutely on your indiscretions Aren't you ready yet, dear, Good gracious, I've been waiting for half an hour What have you been doing? It's only half past seven Oh Willie I do wish you wouldn't work yourself out of such a state on every first night You don't seem to realize,dear, this is no ordinary first night Carte built this theatre specially for us,if Iolanthe fails in the full glare of this confounding new electric light you find yourself married to a ruined man Dear,dear,dear We ought to had a fortnight extra rehearsal at least Why don't you go away sit down and smoke a cigar Sullivan is enough to undermine anybody's nerve He is not at all well,as you know,he is a sick man He will get about hobnobbing with half the crowned heads of Europe leaving everything till the last moment, what's the result? He has to sit up all last night,scoring the music And very nice music, it is too Willie,I do wish.. I don't feel like a cigar,the distractions scaring me in the face Brandy and soda then Are we going to celebrate afterwards? Arthur Sullivan is giving a party at Romano's We certainly are not, I'd soon think of celebrating a first night as I would have forthcoming amputation of the hip joint,do hurry up -Hello,Jenny -Good evening,Mr Sullivan Good evening The best,glad to meet you -Arthur -Ellen My dear,how do you feel? Feeling better every moment The ozone of the theatre It's nothing like it How is he Louis? He should never have come out,Madame Nonsense,how is the house, that's much more important Wonderful,come and see, everyone will be here tonight The Prince of Wales,Duke of Edinburgh, Mr Gladstone,Oscar Wilde,Mr Irwing They are singing the Pirates -Good Evening,Grossmith -Good Evening,Mr Gilbert -How are you feeling? -I'm a bit nervous,I'm afraid You mustn't be nervous,you are playing the Lord Chancellor Lord Chancellors are never at a loss No,I suppose not And you must remember,nervousness always communicating itself to other people Yes,of course I know you won't forget that every syllable of the nightmare song must be absolutely distinct It is very good,Mr Gilbert No man can do more than his best No,Sir I've just been putting Paul Grossmith at his ease Grossmith.Good luck old chap, all the very best Not that you've anything to worry about you've always rise to the occasion You really think so,Dr Sullivan? Think so? I'm sure of it.Gilbert hates first nights,I love them Now you are quite sure you know what to do On the first signal you turn down the gas,on the second the electric power The Royal Highness carriage just entered the Strand The Strand? Come with me He Royal Highness Royal Highnesses,Your Excellencies, My Lords,Ladies and Gentlemen Welcome to our theatre The new home for the genius of Mr Gilbert and Doctor Sullivan This is the first time that it has been attempted to light any public building with the electricity In order that you may judge the difference I have withheld the electric lightning until His Royal Highness gives his gracious assent to the new illumination Your Royal Highness Thank you,thank you Now some anxiety has been expressed as to whether there is any danger to the public,what is termed an electrical shock but as you will see,the lamps are quite safe and easy to handle however,some of you may ask, supposing the lamps were to break surely then they would danger of fire As you can see quite untouched Well done,well done Thank Goodness for that Quite ready Good Luck -Going out ? -I'm going out for a long walk Be ready to take out the house light Ten past nine The night mare song Yes,Sir Large nightcap and soda Beg you pardon,Sir Large brandy and soda Be a minute,yes,Sir Four pence ,please What?

Much better He should never have come,Mr Gilbert Rubbish,Louis,rubbish, I'm perfectly all right Louis,put him to bed and call a doctor Yes,Madame Is he all right,Mr Gilbert? Yes,of course Just a bit overtired,be all right in the morning Mr Sullivan's carriage Would you like us to come with you? No,no I'll be all right Oh,Gilbert,my supper party at Romano's. Would you look after it? Of course,I'll see to it,don't worry about that Sorry,Gilbert Look after him,Louis Yes,Sir Poor Sullivan,amazing Too much for him,you know? All too much for him Well,now come along everybody, Romanos,Romanos We must celebrate That's better.Where was I? I hope you forgive me,my dear Gilbert Oh,yes,my dear Gilbert, I hope you forgive me but it is the first time a new plot of yours has not appealed to me Frankly your idea of a magic lozenge is one that I cannot bring myself to swallow Although I'll be only too glad to resume my happy collaboration on a story of really human interest and probability Meanwhile there is no hurry as I accepted an invitation to compose a dramatic cantata for the Leed's festival for which my friend Joseph Bennet the eminent critic is adapting Longfellow's beautiful poem the Golden Legend so very much is expected of me by the world of serious music that I must devote myself during the coming weeks to this ambitious work How does that sounds to you? I'm more delighted than I can say it Gilbert is not going to like this,you know Your friends are asking themselves what are you going to give us? Another Pirates or Pinafore that will be dead and forgotten in another ten years or a stream of glorious harmony that will live forever What's wrong with both? Oh,Arthur Will you see that this goes over to Mr Gilbert by hands at once? Yes,Sir It's almost half past,Sir What? Good heavens,so it is Well,I must be going No,my dear Joseph there is no need for that No,I must not take up your time,it is too valuable and we haven't much time to spare My dear Arthur,the path of the two Arthurs is beset with temptations Thank you I'm glad you are devoting yourself to work of a more earnest character -Au revoir -Good Bye,Joseph Louis,preserve your master from distractions we are expecting great things of him Yes,Sir To resume our happy collaboration on a story of real human interest and probability Human interest and probability? My dear Sullivan Willie,darling I thought you might like some coffee as you don't seem to be coming to bed How does it feel to be married to a transcendent genius? I suppose I'll always taken it for granted, dear -Milk? -Thank you Kitty,I had a magnificent idea How nice,biscuit? Will you telephone Sullivan for me? But it is past midnight,Willie He never goes to bed Are you there? Metropolitan Exchange 3684 please I'll give him human interest and probability -Yes -Sullivan,can you hear me? It's you,Gilbert -I've got something to read to you at once -What? I'm sending my carriage But I'm working,I'm in bed Never mind,get up Get dressed,we are going to Japan Capital,bravo May I ask ,what was it? From Mikado Another comic opera? Well,yes Well,thank you ladies,that was very nice,that'll for today Good Bye,Dr Sullivan Thank you,Dr Sullivan Thank you,Sir Such a lovely tune I thought you might like to know that Her Majesty the Queen has graciously consented to attend the first London performance of the Golden Legend The Queen? That is of course if you ever have time to finish it Gilbert What is it,D'Oyly Carte? I think you ought to know,I've still haven't heard anything from Sullivan You mean he hasn't fit the music? Not a crotchet But he promised me faithfully here we are the first full costume rehearsal and still three numbers missing I shall speak to him on the telephone at once I have tried that, apparently Louis can't get him near the machine -That's absurd.Give me my hat -Yes,Sir You keep the mettle,Carte The time has come to extract these numbers from Sullivan if necessary by force Arthur Sullivan,Doctor of Music First Principal of the National School of Music,for services to music Doctor Sullivan,Your Majesty Good Morning,Doctor Sullivan I'm very pleased your name has been submitted by the prime minister for recognition of your music, which we all so greatly admire Your Majesty is most gracious Sir Arthur May I say so,Arthur,how greatly I admired your cantata the Golden Legend,I frequently play passages from it on the pianoforte I'm deeply honoured,Mam Why don't you write a grand opera? A grand opera,Madam? You do it so well Yes,Mam Ladies and gentlemen,to the new opera To Ruddigore,may it be the best yet We all drink to that Ruddigore what a score What a title of it Gilbert,what would you say our doing a grand opera together A grand opera? Yes,one of them I though Gilbert might like to write the book My dear fellow I'm tremendously flattered but whoever heard the word grand opera always the triumph of sound over sense If I don't hear my words you know how it upsets my digestion I only raised the point because I thought I'd like to write in a new field for a change Quite so,I understood perfectly A field where the music doesn't have to take second place Second place? The second place for the words You are joking You know I believe in serious you are not suggesting that's what happened with me,are you? But everyone knows that,Gilbert What? My dear Sullivan you can't expect me to take you seriously Are you really under the impression you've been effacing yourself during the last twelve years? I can assure you that time after time I have had to reduce my music to a mere "rumpti-tum" so every syllable of yours could be heard at the back of the gallery You've getting a touch of the sun, you'd better put your hat on My dear fellow,anyone can tell you that I always had to play second fiddle While my words been consistently drowned by your first fiddle more than your confounded fiddle Gentlemen,please think of the company I am thinking of the company if Sullivan turns to grand opera, they all will be out of work I'm perfectly willing to go on as we are apparently he isn't No one has the company more at heart just because I refuse to consider myself chained to comic opera Very few people would object being chained to a gold mine A gold mine that may very soon be exhausted I don't really see what's that has to do with grand opera It has this to do with it I'm not content to go on with the old way one moment longer Then I am not content to go in any other way if we work together we must work as master and master,not as master and servant Exactly,so far it has always been Gilbert's comedies with music tacked on by me Tacked on? I do not what to say.How can I reply to such preposterous nonsense Don't try,Willie Dear,this was such a happy occasion I am sorry,Helen,but the truth chooses its own time to come out and the truth is I lost my liking for comic opera and I'll have no more to do with it Ladies and Gentlemen,I give you Mr Gilbert and Sir Arthur Sullivan It would be nice if you would sat down Sullivan is an hour and half late already do you suppose he is coming at all this morning? Come,come,we both know better than that After what what happened yesterday there is no telling what he will do Gilbert,do try to make allowances Thank you,that was excellent I'm terribly sorry to be so late He is coming along Shocking night I apologize for keeping the company waiting Good Morning,Sullivan How are you? I'd like to begin with numbers four and five,if Mr Gilbert has no objections Mr Gilbert has no objections to rehearsing numbers four,five or any other number Sir,Roderick Robin,callers and ghosts,position,please -Helen -Yes,I know I heard Don't worry,they'll never keep it up, it will be all right after the first night -Good Morning,Sir Arthur -Good Morning,Sellier Line after e gentlemen Cab Give us back,the Mikado Give us back the Mikado Whatever the press may say the advance booking was excellent I think we ought to tell that to Gilbert and Arthur quickly Yes,of course Are you there? Mr Carte want's to speak to Mr Gilbert,please What? Has he? Thank you Apparently Mr Gilbert is not answering the telephone this morning to anyone Please telephone to Arthur Sullivan immediately Mr Carte,this is Louis speaking Sir Arthur left this morning What? Where to? He took the first train for the Continent Sullivan has gone abroad What is the address? I'm afraid he didn't leave one,Sir All he said that he was going to devote himself to work of more earnest character Faites vos jeux ,Monsieurs,Medames Helen,what are you doing here? D'Oyly thought a little slug would be good for me to my belief it was quite right,I think you've done rather well as you are, Arthur How did you know I was in Monte Carlo? It isn't tactless to quote Ruddigore "Paragraphs got into all the papers" Did they I didn't see them Of course not you were applying yourself to work of more earnest character Really,Helen Ruddigore is still running although no one knows for how long Helen,dear,I'm delighted to see you,of course if you come all this way with any idea of trying to make me change my mind -Have a little stimulant,Arthur -A little one You are going to need every drop of it Helen,surely you can understand, time is slipping by already I've spent too much of it on trifles from now on I'm determined to devote myself entirely to serious music Believe me,we do understand,you jump to the quite wrong conclusions It is simply that D'Oyly has sent me here to give you a small message He has decided to build another theatre Another theatre? What for? He is going to call it the Royal English Opera House And I'm here,Arthur to invite you to compose the first grand opera to open the theatre Are you serious? Completely serious,D'Oyly is very ambitious too,you know Helen,Helen,how can I ever thank you Then you accept? Accept? Of course I accept, I must leave at once But there is time for coffee,the theatre hasn't been designed yet What? Oh yes,thank you black So much to do I must see D'Oyly about a subject Have you ever read Scott’s Ivanhoe, a magnificent story for a grand opera If only one could find the right man to adapt the book Btw,Mr Gilbert is sending his kindest regards Gilbert ? You know,he would never touch grand opera Of course not,I merely indicating he is willing let bygones be bygones And in any event he is too busy for his new libretto for the Savoy I wonder if the young Pinero What new libretto? It's another comic opera,I think it is the best thing he has done It's a charming romance set in the Tower of London,I think you like it I'll what? There is plenty of time to do both,isn't it? Helen Sugar,Arthur? Helen You aren't by any chance trying to bribe me with a grand opera? I said,sugar? On the desk Helen Thank you,thank you What do you think of this? The Royal English Opera House as it will look in twelve months time D'Oyly it's magnificent Gilbert says it will never pay, calls it Carte's Folly Yes,but he admits that he and Arthur has never worked together so happily Thanks to our peace maker Now Kitty,my dear,are you listening? Yes,Willie Very well,The Gondoliers,Act 1 Scene 1, the curtain rises,the scene is Venice Once upon a time,that's how all the best stories begin there were two gondoliers there names were Marco and Giuseppe, Giuseppe is the stout one At last we have arrived at our destination this is the Duke of Paris and it is here the grand inquisitor resign Until it is ascertained which of you two gondoliers is to be king I have arranged that you shall reign jointly as one individual as one individual like this something like that -Good Afternoon,Mr Gilbert -Good Afternoon,James -Good Afternoon,Madam -Good Afternoon It good to see you again I hope you had a nice holiday in India Wonderful,half killed me An accident,Sir? Gout Oh,dear,Sir,I am sorry This hasn't seen the inside of a boot for the last three months Tell Mr Shank that I like to have a word with him,will you? He's down at Shaftesbury Avenue at the moment,Sir Didn't he know we were coming home today? It's all been repainted So it has,got a new carpet too That's right,Sir Great improvement,I'll go straight up to Mr Carte's office Yes,Sir Must have cost Carte a pretty penny Don't rush after him,William All right,don't fuss I'm still in what humorously is referred as the private life Carte is not here I expect he is back stage then I sent him a telegram,if there is one thing Carte expects,it's a telegram He is sure to be here in a minute I think we both feel a benefit if you sat down Nobody there either Come in,the place is inhabited after all -Perhaps I was rather overstating it -Yes,Sir Tell Mr Carte that Mr and Mrs Gilbert have arrived He is not in,Sir Where is he? Shaftesbury Avenue What is this devouring passion for Shaftesbury Avenue? He is at the new Opera House,Sir The new opera house,I see Tell Mrs Carte then She is out too,Sir Where is she? Thank you boy,that'll do The new Mecca apparently Never mind you can meet him tomorrow I particularly want to see him today here I am after months abroad teeming with new ideas Can you hear me? This is Mr Gilbert,is Arthur Sullivan in London? He is,oh capital,will you? Thank you Savoy Theatre Quarterly Accounts, copy for Mr Gilbert Don't you think you ought to put your foot up,my dear? I feel more like putting it down at the moment,dear Quite bad enough,not being met at the station How on earth Good Heavens,Carte deducted 4500 £ from our profit for so called expenses he is actually charging us 500 £ for that new carpet Hello,yes I certainly do,will you connect him,please Hello,Sullivan,how are you? Have you seen.. Where is he gone? The new opera house,there you have the answer in a nutshell Kitty you take a carriage home I have business to attend to Do wait till you calm down,dear, where are you going now? I'm joining the gathering procession to Shaftesbury Avenue Where is Mr D'oyly Carte? Up there,Sir -Take me up -What? Don't argue,man,take me up All right Magnificent.If you think of the classical music should I feel we take out in gold Quiet.Isn't it Gilbert? How are you,Gilbert Back I see.What do you think of all this? I must apologize for intruding on your private Valhalla,gentlemen I realize I'm only a figure from the popular theatre What's the matter Gilbert? I have just left Savoy,you may recollect that there is such a place to find it deserted by the management and other evidence of gross neglect What do you mean,gross neglect? Exactly what I say,if you have seen these accounts of course you haven't, I always have to attend to them Can't you get this thing down? 4500 £ deducted from our profits, do you hear that,Sullivan? I'm not interested 250 £ for a gondola, 150 £ for iron mongering,iron mongerer, capital,500 £ for that carpet the carpet for the front of the house while Carte has been building his white elephant you and I have been refurbishing the Savoy fully unaware White? Are you calling this a white elephant? Gilbert,I should be sorry to lose the advantage of the production of your future operas but the earth doesn't contain the money that will pay me to put up with these sort of things Very well,then,I'll write no more for the Savoy Wait for me,Warlock Sir Arthur Sullivan,beg you pardon Sir,I'm from the Chronicle I was afraid you might be -About these rumours,Sir -What? That your long partnership with Mr Gilbert is likely to come to an end I can't say anything now,excuse me I'm merely insisting,Madame that he has no rights to charge any part of that carpet to Sullivan or myself And I insist that it comes under the simple heading of fair wear and tear clause 7 of our agreement Mumbo jumbo I don't know quite what you are suggesting -D'Oyly,Gilbert,listen to me -Sullivan,please No,let me speak.For over fifteen years our three names have been linked in harmony, wherever where our operas are played,you often said that Gilbert and Sullivan are as much a national institution as Westminster Abbey And here we are bickering over the price of a carpet Gentlemen,please remember you are quarrelling in the very theatre built out of your success Listen why don't you take a leaf out of your own book The Gondoliers at two Free from every kind of passion some solution we must find,your words,Mr Gilbert,your music Sir Arthur Thank you,Helen I'm sure we can forget what been said and talk over our difficulties calmly like reasonable men I'm more than willing All right,Carte you'll be reasonable first I'm sure if Gilbert looks at it calmly he is bound to see that my attitude is reasonable In other words no advance on fair wear and tear Don't you think we could forget the carpet if only for a moment Nothing would delight me more Madame to shake the dust of clause seven from our feet besides we all know the carpet is only a symptom of the disease which has been rotting the fabric of this partnership since 1883 If we must quarrel,at least can't we quarrel in the present tense I can well understand your reluctance to embark on the past imperfect I'm only reluctant.. So it has come to this end It has After fifteen years wonderful association over a mere carpet No,Madame,people may say so but Sullivan knows and I know that it goes deeper than that I said it before and I 'll say it again a cobbler should stick to his last There is nothing more to be said I'm physically and mentally ill over this whole wretched business Very well,God Day,Madame,Good Day Carte I think you may find it was a mistake to kick down the ladder by which you've risen Dedicated by special permission to Her Most Gracious Majesty The Queen at whose suggestion this work was written in grateful acknowledgement of Her Majesty's kindly encouragement by her humble and devoted subject and servant,Arthur Sullivan Thank you indeed,Sir Arthur I shall treasure this always,such a very beautiful volume So this work was written on my suggestion? Indeed yes,Mam,Your Majesty may perhaps recall Yes,yes I believe I do How very gratifying I've been thinking it's time we had a performance at Windsor a stage can very easily be erected in the Waterloo Gallery and the company could be brought down from London It's an honour and a privilege,Mam It shall be arranged shortly Since the Prince of Wales told me all about it I have always wanted to see the Gondoliers The Gondoliers,Mam? Yes,of course I know all the tunes very well already but.. What is it Sir Arthur? Would it not be practical? Certainly,Mam,of course It's just I'm overwhelmed The cobbler should stick to his last Happy New Year,my dear Happy New Year,Helen You know,it's not everyone who is privileged of watching the old year and the old century go out hand in hand The old century,Victoria's century sad to see it go,so many things has gone with it I know what you are thinking You always do Sullivan and Gilbert? Gilbert and Sullivan They may come back after all No,they are not even on speaking terms Besides it's never quite be the same This is a night for looking forward,not back You are right,come to think of it, you always are right The new century To the new century No,no.That wasn't how I taught it to you years ago Mr Gilbert! Now,once again,please,and I helped that man to escape And I kept his secret And pretended that I was his dearly loving sister That was much better,my dear Punctuate,punctuate Mr Gilbert,it's wonderful to see you again after all this long time I thought the quartet was quite beautiful rendered but you must remember your consonants your ms and your ns and your ts Mr Gilbert -How are you? -Good Afternoon,Mrs Carte I came up to London to lunch at the Garrick as I happened to be passing I thought I'd look in We are all very glad that you did Mr Cross,I think we might all have tea now How's D'Oyly? He is a little better,he got up the first time yesterday Good -Been a long time -Yes I think the Yeoman was favourite,you know Best thing Sullivan and I ever wrote I hear he has been ill too Very ill,indeed -Is he back in England? -Yes -He got back last week -Good,good Poor fellow He suffered a great deal You know it is over two years since he and I spoke to each other That's nothing less than a tragedy,Mr Gilbert Things were never the same after our quarrel nothing seemed to go right for us,you know Is Sullivan coming to the first night of our revival? He might if you were to ask him I? I think it would mean a great deal to him Can't you send him a message? I really don't think that's necessary -My dear Gilbert -My dear Sullivan I was lunching at the club and happened to be passing -So I heard -Oh,did you? I'm sorry to see you like this Yes,he gave me up for lost in the south of France Prince of Wales sent his own doctor but I am a good deal better now as you can see Yes,yes,quite yes,obviously Gilbert,what would you say to burying the hatchets once and for all and smoking the pipe of peace There is nothing I should like more,just a minute How's the gout? That's taken a back feet,arthritis has now moved up in the first place Same old Gilbert Couldn't we make this a public reconciliation? What do you mean? Take our calls together on the first night like we used to do,all three of us? -Including Carte? -Why not? The old firm or should I say the infirm This thing presents certain problems Not at all Louis can wheel you off What a trio of old crocks we pick up, what we really need is three wheel chairs So we..That's a brilliant idea What? We all take our calls in wheel chairs Gilbert,you are quite right,three wheel chairs it'll look wonderful from the front It'll bring the house down Helen,put down two wheel chairs for the opening night the the third one will do for D'Oyly Yes,I heard you,I think it is a charming idea You can wheel D'Oyly on,Helen Arthur,I don't want to hurry you but I think it is time Louis would taking you home Already? You know he has very strict instructions,isn't that so,Louis? I have Madame D'Oyly I suppose orders is orders,looking forward to give some moan again soon -Good Bye Gilbert -See you on Tuesday night Rather I wouldn't miss an opening for the rouse Mr Gilbert,what do you think of his appearance? His appearance,Mrs Carte, is of no consequence what we couldn't stand would be his disappearance I got this to a tee now Is Sullivan here? It would be wise for him not to come before the finale Now let see,I should make my entrance from the prompt side Sullivan from the op like we always used to do when we had the full use of our legs Carte I want you to go in centre through the players Yes,but I'd always have to argue with the producer but shan't I look rather prominent? My dear fellow,that's the whole idea, after all,you started it So I think you are fine -Where? -Here Get in my dear fellow,Cary will you wheel Sir Arthur's chair in from over there when I give the signal? Mrs Carte,you wheel in D'Oyly from over there Right,positions,please Ready everybody,right,off we go Thank you Harry Probably we are getting due for an encore Sullivan is here No,Sir What is it,Louis? We sent for the doctors at six,Madam He asked me to give this to Mr Gilbert He insisted My dear Gilbert,I feel the disappointment so very much Good Luck to you all,three wheel chairs would have looked wonderful from the front How is he,Louis?
