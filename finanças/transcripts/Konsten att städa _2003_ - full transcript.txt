Everyone complains about the job. "Yuck!" they say... "Cleaning is horrible." But I disagree. I think it's nice. I really enjoy it. I never find it boring. Every day is just as much fun... just as nice. It doesn't matter what I'm doing. I wouldn't have it any other way... It couldn't be better. – Look at this! – Yes, I can see. What are you cooking? Our society isn't really suitable for children. We don't have time to take care of them properly. Society isn't organised for people to have children. Animals take care of their young! They almost take more care in looking after their offspring... ...than human beings do these days. I'm probably old fashioned, but I just don't understand it. Fishing is the thing that means most to me... Sitting there with nature... ...just looking at the lake. If you don't catch anything, it doesn't matter. To be able to sit there with nature is the main thing. It's like a balm for the soul. It really is. Everyone seems to be on some sort of medication... ...and pills. They suffer from nerves, and don't feel well... It's incredible. It's actually quite crazy. In my little paradise I have no electricity and no water... Nothing. Just a wood stove. Here, I'm happiest. It's quiet. Nothing or no one to bother me. It's a shame I'm so old, otherwise I'd definitely move into the forest. Where nature's at its purest. I think young people are going to come back to nature. They see that a purely material life has no meaning. It wearies them. I think they're sick of it. I really believe they want a different life. ♫ I always want to be ♫ here up close to you ♫ Tonight the stars light up again ♫ Tonight I believe in love ♫ When I see into your eyes ♫ I feel deep down inside ♫ that you really know I love you I think that our lifetime is fixed. We've been allotted a time to live here on Earth... That's just the way it is. Anyway, I do believe there's a life after this. Otherwise there'd be no point in it. There wouldn't. Time for bed. Come on now... yes... You can stop slobbering, 'coz we're going to sleep. That's the way. "Can you play Blueberry Hill for Kristina who is the mother of my children? " Sure! ♫ I found my thrill ♫ on Blueberry Hill ♫ on Blueberry Hill ♫ when I found you ♫ The moon stood still ♫ on Blueberry Hill ♫ and lingered until ♫ my dreams came true ♫ The wind in the willow played ♫ love's sweet melody ♫ but all of those vows we made ♫ are never to be ♫ Though we're apart ♫ you're part of me still ♫ for you were my thrill ♫ on Blueberry Hill... Night becomes day from the explosions, reports Israeli radio. The population is being ordered into the shelters. No combat contact is reported yet between the different forces. Israel's goal is to strike the PLO- bases in Lebanon a hard blow. The Israeli attack follows a familiar pattern: Palestinian raids receive counter- attacks. The goals must be military- - but many civilians are killed. It's the biggest attack so far –over Lebanese territory. The outcome impossible to tell A plane with two terrorists and ten hostage took off today from Larnaca. Terrorists threaten to kill hostages if they don't get safe-conduct. Unrest occurred today in Tabriz Iran. Parts of the center were destroyed. A month ago, 78 people were killed in similar riots in Qom. Somali forces in Ogaden province are advancing towards Dire Dawa– - says the West Somali Liberation Front. Sport: In the National League Selanger beat Sandviken 4 to 3. ♫ O holy moment for the world ♫ when the Son of God descended to earth! ♫ To reconcile ♫ the crimes and sins of the world ♫ for us he suffered the pain of death ... As soon as anything happens they have to hire a consultant! When I was cleaning in the industry, a firm produced cleaning instructions They were paid 10,000 for it! Those of us who did the job knew where the shit was! ♫ O holy night! ♫ You gave us salvation And to the weather: After a night of severe cold it will get warmer. Thin cloud will obscure the sun That was the local Dala news. You are listening to Radio Sweden, Dalarna P4 Got something. A tiddler... Feel like a sandwich? He's presenting the budget to the Speaker, Birgitta Dahl. He's wiped the cream off his hair Madam Speaker, despite some slowing of activity, our economy is strong. Growth is good, inflation is low, Government finances show surpluses. The good economy is a result of the economic policies we pursued. This can be described in three steps. First is to have order in the economy. Thanks to this policy there is now room for reform. It's the Sweden of the future that they talk about... we're so good... It's all over with that "good" now. And it's exactly the same thing, regardless of who sits there. They look after each other, and the rest of us have to pay. They're a self-serving clique. Anyway, we don't need a government. The EU decides everything for us. A lot of people say... "God, how you drudge!" "Drudge"? What do you mean? It's fun to help people! That's what life's about. The meaning of life... Helping other people. It is... That's all it is. In the Bach family, it was all about music You were taught to be a musician –and got to learn several instruments - organ, violin, flute... Bach seemed to live in the notes and the notes lived in Bach. There's something out of my reach I'd like to undertake, but can't. I feel I know about things... ...that don't exist today, that I've experienced. Far back in time, I think... I think I was there... living there. It feels so clear, that sometimes I think... "How strange!" But then I think... "That can't be the case today." "No, not a chance. It may have been then, but..." It's Wally. Hi, Wally! Hi, Stina! How are things? I have back problems... and I'm expecting the family here. The house is a mess. Can you help me tidy up? Sure. We can work something out. But I'm babysitting at the moment. Who is it? It's Amanda. Amanda Louise Viktoria. Viktoria... like the crown princess! She was named after me. Is your name Viktoria? Yes. Wally Viktoria... Wally Viktoria Pettersson.
