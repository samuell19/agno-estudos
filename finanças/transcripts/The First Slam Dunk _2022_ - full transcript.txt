- You're getting better, When'd you learn to do these fakes? - I'm going to be a starter. - Oh, I see. Mom, I'll be the captain and I'll take care of this house Listen Ryota... It's up to us to support mom now I'll be the captain... And you'll be the co-captain... I'm counting on you Ryota If you plan to be a starter I'll treat you like one One on One Don't turn your back on me so carelessly!! I'm reading your next move! You have to get past me Are you scared? Need some courage? It happens to me too The nerves makes my heart pound like crazy So I try hard to pretend I'm fine - Foul! - No, it wasn't! The game starts when you fall, Ryota! Let's go! Come at me! Don't run away! You did good That's the energy... Never forget it Sota... - Wanna play again? - Alright, let's go Hey! Sota! - Please play with me - I can't, already made plans - Come on, let's keep playing - We'll play tomorrow - Then, let me go with you - You're too young to come with us Stay and work on your dribbling Wanna be a starter, right? You ass, you told me that we were going to play one on one Don't run away! You're scared to lose aren't you! Liar! Comeback Sota! You're stupid, I hate you I don't want to play with you anymore DON'T EVER COMEBACK! I'm ready Representing Kanagawa Prefecture Shohoku High School Representing Akita Prefecture Sannoh Kogyo High School They're pressing from the start Here! Nobe! What's wrong Ryo? Nothing, I just thought you weren't going to score - That's worth 2 points too, yo - Yo? - You guys see that? They are pretty loud - They brought a lot of people Their crowd is pretty insane, right? I'm pretty sure we have less people Let's see... Someone's sister - Their friends... - Look at the other team I told you guys to make matching shirts If you want to make an ass of yourself it's not my problem Move Hanamichi, you are in the way Don't you guys find it weird to see Hanamichi on the court? He's a clown Hey, here! - So that's what being a mother feels like - We are feeling the same What are you guys talking about? You better cheer our team! MITSUI! LET'S GO! Let's go, Let's go, Mitsui! No way These guys like to have the lead... ...but today Mitsui is ready to beat them. That's it! Nice He's amazing Good defense, let's stop that possession That fool... If you keep moving like that you'll end up pretty tired Well... I'm a genius There is no one in Japan that can get to the rim like him Japan's number 1? Nevermind, there's one You better start playing Sannoh's royalty This is the best guard in Japan He has humiliated every guard in Japan - Don't back down, Miyagi - I won't! I'm gonna make a fool of you for 40 minutes! 15th Mini-Basket Tourney Cup --- Boy's division - Kaouru, there is a free seat here - Thank you It's nice to see you here We were waiting for you Let's go Ryo! Nice pass Good shot Ryo has been faster than usual Maybe because you are here You can do it! That number 7 plays quite well Although he's short He's the one I told you about Sota's brother The one that died a few years ago Oh! I remember he used the same number - He was really good, right? - So he died... - Yeah, some accident in the ocean. - That's not true - Don't lie, Sota went to live in an island - Anna! I'm sorry... The second half is starting! - Number 7 - Number 15 - Number 5 That's it! By the way... I played against your brother one time I couldn't do anything in that game and I lost What's wrong? You'll never play like him Don't give up! Here I go! Ryo! Ryo you can do it! Well... What a let down, nothing like his brother That kid will never be like his brother I think it's a good time to pack this stuff What if we move somewhere else? Just because your brother wore number 7 doesn't mean you have to wear it You can change it if you want But I like number 7 What are you doing? Don't ever come to this room Take that off, you have your own clothes Get off me! That kid will never be like his brother We are starting the second half! The real match starts now Easy... we have time Damn it We will take the lead in the 3rd minute from the second half Miyagi, pass it! These guys are annoying - Poor guys - This is bad for Shohoku Again? I'm here Give me the ball! Don't underestimate me Offense, charging! Now introduce yourself to the class Ryota Miyagi From now on Ryota will be your classmate... - And that kid, who does he think he is? - He's moving from Okinawa... So he doesn't know too much about how things work around here- Don't be a wise-ass Hey kid... Go play with that ball somewhere else! Shut up! What if we invite that kid? Looks like he likes to play alone Are you from Primary? First year of Secondary You won't beat me from just using fakes You have to go forward! Try to get past me! What? Are you going to give up? If you play alone all the time you won't get better Mitsui! Want to play next time? I hope you'll be able to beat me Shut up... What are you doing? I haven't touched the ball in this half Shut up! If we push the lead to 20 points We can destroy the spirit... ...of Shohoku's freshmen - 5 seconds - Hurry up! 10 seconds! Get past half court! Take it! What kind of pass was that? You too Rukawa! Help them bring it up the court! Foul and one! Timeout, Sannoh! Little Ryo, I haven't touched the ball the whole half Take a minute to breathe... If I were Sannoh I would press full court... Until our team get overwhelmed or until it breaks our spirit We are doing great Shohoku can't deal with our pressure - Now it's time to attack - Yeah! We can't lose that - Mitsui, Rukawa... - Yeah! I want you both to run down court - And you Miyagi... - Yeah? This will be your playground - So what about the genius Sakuragi, pops? - I want you to head to the basket And just run -Got it - Ryota, give me your hand - Red team, hurry! What are you doing? I want you to be the same cocky fool that I know - They are going for Miyagi again! - Leave him alone! Sawakita, the ball! - He's really fast! - He's leaving him behind! I'm the number 1 in term of speed Take it! Good pass! - 3 on 2! - Here we'll change the flow of the game No way Finally I got it... Turn around and the shot I trained! - He saved it! - One shot at a time, we can do it! Kawata... Nice! - Can he shoot? - No, he doesn't have the shot! Will I be able to beat this guy? - You can do it, Akagi! - Let's go! You guys already did that play... We know about it We know that play too Here I go! Look, this is a great game They're up by 20 points! One basket, let's start with that Ichino... Look at Mitsui Looks like your pressure from the first half is finally showing Was like a lethal blow to him Are you gonna shoot, yo? He never hits his jumpers Does he know Ryota's weakness? Damn it! There is only one plan left - Sakuragi, the secret weapon! - Secret weapon? Sakuragi! Traveling! - Hey, take this seriously or I'll kill you - Shut up idiot, it was just an accident 8 minutes and not a single basket We have to score at least one Here! Here! Get by him! This guy... ...has no weaknesses - Rukawa, be careful! - He's surrounded Come on, you can do it! We can't lose this match Hey! What? Timeout! How a team like us could even get here... is because of our strong inside presence from Akagi But it's not enough Defense, defense! Defensive effort is all I want to see from you! It's absolutely roasting today! Miyagi... you have to talk Don't play in silence. I want to hear you! Next - I'm not that type of player - Miyagi! Was it necessary to show off like that? You complicate the game too much Akagi, shut up... Ignore him, you'll get used to it It's either that or you quit the team I just made a quick pass... so that the defense wouldn't be able to react fast enough I guess the team isn't capable of playing at that level What did you say? Whatever... we don't get along Akagi believes in you - More than any other player in the team - What? I'm sorry You're too short Who would expect something from a shorty Only height matters in basketball - What? - Let's leave, Ryota - Hey longhair! - WHAT? I'm ready for a one on one whenever you want With one condition... If you lose you have to shave your head... Deal? WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY? We'll get you! - That brat - Norio... ...let's destroy that kid With pleasure Shohoku vs Egawa Industry Here! Why didn't he pass? He was open Senpai! Loose ball! - Defense! - Get back! Just sub me in! Losers Do you think you are the only one that tried? Relax... Whatever... now I can retire I can leave now But this is just the beginning for you guys The arc of terror begins... I'm so sorry for everyone... Wish you all the best for next season Even though... I don't think you can make it to the summer ...troublemaker - Ah? - What's with the attitude? Are you making fun of me? A stubborn mule and a troublemaker... Doubt you guys can get along At least Miyagi can pass the ball You boys are overthinking Let's use that energy in our bodies - Kogure - Yeah? Switch with Sakuragi Back on the court Hey pops... How dare you to sub out this genius? You sub him in... Just because he is about to graduate, really? - Who is Sannoh's next opponent? - Aiwa High School, looks interesting I might be the only one that thinks we can still win You still haven't given up, right pops? Why would I? The game ends once you give up Even if you are still playing Box him out! - That's it! - Awesome - We'll go after the basket, watch this - Yeah! They're too tall Rebound! Watch this What would have happen if you would have taken that rebound - Yamao would feel insecure of their abilities? - That doesn't matter First, there wouldn't be a counterattack after Sannoh's rebound So we would get another chance to score That means, they wouldn't get their 2 points and we would gain 2 points You understand, Sakuragi? It's a 4 point play If you can do that, you'll be the Ace that changes the scoreboard around Grab the ball... grab the ball... Let me give you my energy Sakuragi I believe in you! - Take my energy - Take mine too - And my energy What are they doing? This is wrong... - This is a really lame way of thinking - What else can we do? We won't get the rebound with that Not yet, pops? It still isn't my turn to play? Sub me in already! HANAMICHI! They will sub him out even with this lead? That kid can't score from the 3 point line You can do it Sakuragi Hey, four-eyes Hanamichi... We are counting on you, troublemaker Give it your best, rookie The game ends once you give up Even if you're still playing... Why the hell did you do that? What is he doing? - Number 10 what are you doing? - That idiot Ahem, Sannoh will be defeated by the genius Sakuragi Are you dumb? I'm sorry, he just started playing He doesn't know the rules If he does that again he's out of the game So, what do you guys think about that? Now we have no choice but to win Why the long face, Gori? You don't think we can win? - What are you talking about? - So naive, haven't you looked at the scoreboard? Fools, everything you guys are saying hold no power over me Because I'm a beginner So, team... Are you gonna follow this genius? What? I can't hear you! Hey you! Cheer the team to win! We can't lose to this annoying crowd! To win? - Let's go, we can do it! - Don't give up! Fool! He shot the ball without thinking That's the problem Mine! Yeah! - Yeah, that's it! - Cheater Yeah! The score in the second half is 26 to 2 But we're not losing the battle of wills... Soon we'll have our chance We have to get the lead down to 10 points Akagi, help! - Nice Ryota - That's it! Pay attention! Don't waste our chances Damn it - 3 points! - Get in! - Again? - That was a fake What? Sakuragi! Everyone saw that? - Awesome, he followed the shot - Thanks to that we were able to score And the reason why I subbed him in Wasn't only to grab rebounds - Let's focus for these next 10 points - Yeah! - Let's go Shohoku, let's win Shohoku! - Let's go Shohoku, let's win Shohoku! Akagi! You're holding the ball too long! No, that shot won't go in! I knew it! So high! And he got control of the ball? He's fast! How? Not bad, redhead Hanamichi, pass it! National Champions Offense, charging! You do everything alone, all the time What if we stay on the ground No one will blame you It's just what you had to do It doesn't matter, you guys won't win I guess you're doing it again Thinking you're the only one trying Don't put the dream of being National Champions on us, It's annoying Akagi, let me ask you a question... What does it feel to look down on everyone? Do you think you're better than everyone? - Are you ok, can you continue? - Yeah, I'm good I see... I'm already fulfilling my dreams right this moment Gori finally woke up Kawata is Kawata, you are you... Akagi is Akagi... and me...? Red team's ball One basket! I got you That guy is at his limit - Kawata is Kawata, Akagi is Akagi... - What did he say? And me...? Who am I? I want you to say my name Say it loud, who am I? Hey! So this is a gang? I never thought these things were real I don't like how the arch of your eyebrows wise-ass Well... I don't like your long hair I want you to say my name! Mitsui! Yeah! You're running on fumes Nice! There's only a 10 point difference Hey Miyagi... You have to use me Akagi will screen for me I have to create space And use that moment to score 3 points Hey! - Yeah! - That's it! The only thing I can see is the rim Let's move! Offense to defense... We're on defense now, right? How? He's clearly at his limit Don't worry Matsumoto... Let him shoot He's stubborn... Well... it's easier to guard the 3s We only have to grab the rebounds That's not going in! I knew it Rebound! Oye, brat! What's wrong with you? Hey, can't you see we're talking to you? Hey! Don't get cocky! - Perfect! - Take this! - You think you're too cool, right? - You'll pay for this Bastard! Mitsui! Get off him! - You're gonna pay for this! - Don't move! What is this? Snow? Looks like trash... My heart is beating so fast What happened? Ryo, open the door! Shit... Shit... Shit... Shit... Shit... Ryo? Ryo! Mom! Ryo woke up! Are you okay Ryo? Can you hear me? We are in the hospital - Hospital? - The bike was totaled after the crash The bike... I got to see Okinawa... What were you thinking? The doctor said that you were lucky to be alive Can we slow down a bit? What? Weren't you Japan's MVP? You are Ryota, right? Look how much you grew - How have you been? - Grandma, who is he? What's your name? Sota, that's amazing! Are they pro? No, they're from high school They won Nationals 3 times The great team Sannoh Sannoh... Will you try to get into that school? How's this? Is it better? Maybe in 1, 2, 3... in 4 years Okinawa's MVP... Sota Miyagi! There he goes, double clutch layup! He did it! He beat the powerful Sannoh Forgive me Sota Why am I the only one who disappoints mom? If only Sota were here... Let's go! Intentional foul, white number 4! Intentional foul? What? - Nice! - Let's go! What happened to your hair? - Are you really coming back to the team? - Shut up I want everyone to know I don't give up so easily Really? This is a crucial moment We have to take advantage of this opportunity Or else we don't deserve to beat Sannoh - Let's get these 10 points back! - Yeah! Looks like they finally found their rhythm Right? Fukatsu... Japan's best guard Against me? I really have to match his level? I know I've always been a quick player But the reality is... Is that I always fall behind What's up? You don't seem in a good mood Fukatsu was a starter in Sannoh since his first year And I have to play against him... Well, that's obvious After all you both are guards My heart is racing Really? I had no idea You always seem relaxed We all know you're one of the best guards Well... you're not Kanagawa's number 1 And... Come to think of it, not number 2 either... Maybe not even... Okay stop, that isn't helping We should think of something that'll help you focus if things get messy Let me think... How about... Like looking at your hand Number 1 Guard Miyagi is exhausted from playing the whole match Be careful Ryo Please don't miss Shut up! You're distracting me! Everything will be fine Yeah! - Screen! - Switch! Only 10 points! Kawata! Kawata is guarding the redhead! Kawata... That redhead has been the only one besides you... That has given me the most trouble on the boards - What's so funny? - Don't hold anything back, bald orc If you say so Sakuragi changed the pace of the game Rebound! - Sorry, didn't see you - Bald orc! - No! - It goes to Sawakita! Good job Rukawa! - You won't get by me - Are you sure? Don't let them make easy passes Are you sleeping or what? What'd you say? You're a fraud You always talk about being Japan's number 1 But you let that baldie beat you *Sigh* - Are you ignoring me? Focus on defense, Sakuragi! Hey... Is that all you guys got? I'll destroy you I want to see you try Switch! - Kawata! - Yeah! Really? He's still up here with me? That's it! CHARGE! Oh no, I missed! - Who would have thought - These two aren't some ordinary freshmen We might be in trouble if these two start working together Our job is to stop them It's easy, we just need to score... three more times Give me the ball Fukatsu, Alright? - You can do it! - Come on! - Don't lose focus - Defense, everyone! - Here I go! - That's it! - Careful! - Don't come any closer! Keep defending, please! Is there really someone like that of my age? He's probably thought of nothing but basketball the past 17 years But... I've done the same - He's beating him! - No - Fukatsu! - Pass it! You dumbass, fox! That's a careless shot! You got lucky Shohoku (55) - (65) Sannoh You want to be Japan's MVP... Rukawa? Shut up Maybe you can be the MVP ... Once I'm no longer in Japan Ready... GO! Don't underestimate me I achieved everything in high school basketball. I don't think there is anything left to accomplish Give me the experience that I need If you think that I'm missing something Give me the wisdom, please 6, 7, 8, 9, 10... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7... Not bad... I think I can do it again One on One... You'll never beat me, Rukawa I can't believe that Rukawa has been defeated so easily It's not over yet Rebound! I can't let the redhead jump That's the first step... The second is to get the ball What's wrong? Don't tell me that you gave up? - Not yet - You're the star player, Rukawa! Looks like the ball's mine Foul! and one! Shohoku (55) - (73) Sannoh Damn it! What an arrogant prick... Saying that he's the number one He's still a second year like me I'd love to see the frustration on his face - Me too - Yeah, I know By the way... Is this the first time we've talked to each other? - It was a good game... - Yeah it was pretty entertaining Shohoku's team gave a good fight Hey you! The five on the court are against great players The bench has to support them Shohoku (55) - (74) Sannoh Yeah! He still doesn't understand that you can't beat Sawakita? What are you up to Rukawa? He doesn't have any options Rukawa 6 Seconds left! It's about to be a 24 second violation 4 Seconds left! Where is he going? Basket counts! Yeah! Coach? He passed the ball? Rukawa passed? So he's passing? Good decision In! Pass Pressure him! Get off me! Shohoku (59) - (74) Sannoh Rukawa found his rhythm He's acting different Perfect, hit them with everything Rukawa! Not so fast! - Yeah! - Let's go! Shohoku (61) - (74) Sannoh That's it! You came to block me when I can barely lift my arms... I knew it, he's way over his limit 3 minutes and a half and 13 points Mine! Run! - Rukawa run! - Yeah! - Come on! - Run! - Don't let him shoot! - You won't give up, right? Complete silence... This sound... Is what what I live for Shohoku (64) - (74) Sannoh - Yeah! - Only 10 points! They are resilient - Yeah! - Let's take care of this possession This guy! - We're close! - Yeah! Shohoku (66) - (74) Sannoh Everything can change in these 2 minutes and 50 seconds - That's it - Good! - Hey, don't you want to smile or something? Now we have a chance - Gori - What? That guy is just like Rukawa He won't pass up a shot... Because he's never lost No! Yeah! You guys saw that? My amazing plan worked - 2 minutes and a half! - 8 points and the ball is ours! Gori, we can still do this right? - You guys can do it! - We can win! - Don't give up! This guy never hesitates? He made me lose the ball! Someone catch it! Don't give up! DON'T GIVE UP! MITSUI, MOVE! Time out, ref! Hey... Sakuragi? You did a good job But damn are you clumsy - Who you calling clumsy? - So you're still alive - Of course I am! - Can you continue? Yeah What's happening? Shohoku, you can do it! That's it, don't give up! We have to catch up! We really have to destroy them so they can give up? Yeah, louder! Support us! What...? Drop step! - Fade away! - That's it! That's not going in! Rebound! Let's try again Although it's hard... Although my heart's beating a mile a minute... I have to pretend I'm fine Shohoku (66) - (74) Sannoh Idiot... Are you still scared of Kawata? Get off the court if you can't keep up with me - Is it gonna be a drive? or a pass? - You're forgetting something Shohoku (69) - (74) Sannoh - He got the basket! - 3 points! - Time out, Sannoh! This is bad, the pain is getting worse - What's wrong Sakuragi, something hurts you? - No, just my back it hurts a bit What? How's the pain? It feels like a sprain but I'm fine If you keep playing this might be your last game Don't give up Mitsui... You are doing fine... Can you still run? - I can barely lift my arms - Nice... I'll send you all the passes - Hey pops, we still can win, right? - Yeah of course Sakuragi has helped the team with rebounds and heart Miyagi has given us his speed and gamesense Mitsui gave us chaos And later wisdom and sharpshooting Rukawa his explosivity and will to win All of this on top of the foundations of the team that Akagi and Kogure have built These strengths and attributes are what comprises our team This is what defines Shohoku Listen, forget your anger We have never been good friends But... - But what? - Nothing... - Thank you for everything - Eh? - Idiot you call that advice? - Don't think I'm doing this for you - Teams! Ok team... Are you ready? YEAH! - Let's go! - Let's go team! He's going for the mismatch Why isn't it working? He should feel pressured by this Of course... We are against the powerful Sannoh Shohoku (69) - (76) Sannoh - They are pressing! - Ryota! Domoto I won't give up even if we have the lead We'll fight until the last second Because that's our playstyle That's why we are considered invincible - Miyagi! - Ryota Ryota! Show them what you're made of! Happy birthday Sota & Ryota Do you want the small one? - Yeah - Like always Then the rest is for me - What'd you say? - Nothing Take it, the biggest part is for the MVP Yours has more Well, but yours has the card It's weird for brothers to share the same birthday It means we're special So what time tomorrow? Hey Ryo, what time do you leave for Hiroshima? Is that where the Nationals will be held? - 6am - Really? Mom did you hear? He leaves at 6am Ryota is 17 years old and Sota... Hey! 20 years... If he were alive So 20 years... 3 years difference Although he's older now than Sota ever was Let's put his picture up so we don't forget him Is that okay with you, mom? It's been 8 years Yeah Happy 17th Birthday Thank you Dear Mother, Every year when this day comes... I'm sorry that I'm the one alive ...Mother? What's this Dear Mother, please forgive me because I only cause problems... I know you hate basketball... Because it reminds you of Sota... Even though you never asked me to stop... When I played minibasket, it made me really happy that you went to see my games Sota is amazing Already scored 20 points Well... that's why he's the captain You want to be like your brother? I know you can be that good if you practice really hard In a world without Sota... basketball was my biggest reason to live And you let me do it.. So thank you. Stop! Why do you keep doing this! Mom! Help! I don't know what to do anymore I'm glad that I kept going Tomorrow I'll be in the place... Where Sota would have loved to be. - Hey, stop recording! - Keep playing - Lower your knees, like this - Shut up You can do it! - So annoying! - You can't get by me, shorty What can I do... Against giants blocking my way? You can do it! You can do it! YOU CAN DO IT, RYOTA! Dribbling is life... For shorties like me! - Yeah! - Good job Ryota - Defense! - Defense! That's it! In! Foul, basket does not count! You can do it, Akagi - Number 4 has to take free throws - Hey I'm shooting free throws, Sakuragi Really? What kind of joke is this? That slam dunk was a good play by this genius Rukawa don't you dare feel sorry for me... I'll beat you one day Let me go I don't want to sit He hurt himself when he fell over that table But where? - Ayako, please don't say it - In his back Really? Is this the end of my career? Does it all come to a close at the end of this match? So... I won't be able to play anymore? Do you like basketball? I love it, because I'm an athlete Siblings?! Here I go Box me out! Good, That's it! Again Last shot! The left hand supports the ball The debut of the rebound king! Shohoku (70) - (76) Sannoh - Yeah - Good job Hanamichi, we're counting on you troublemaker Damn it... Damn it... - Score - You can do it - Akagi Let's go! Substitution... - Hanamichi! - What are you doing? - Sakuragi, no! - Hey, what do you think you're doing? - Sakuragi! Sakuragi... I'm ready... Take care of the paint, Gori Sakuragi don't spout that nonsense, come back See? You can barely stand - Sorry, cancel the substitution - Hey pops! Sakuragi... I have to confess... Although I noticed immediately that something was wrong I didn't want to sub you out... Because I wanted to see you reach the limits of what you're capable of I've been a bad coach That could have affected the rest of your career Shohoku (71) - (76) Sannoh - 1 minute left! - Sakuragi, let's cheer on the team When were your glory days old man? Was it during Nationals? Because for me... This is my moment of glory! Red, foul! Hey, if you're just gonna stand there, you're just getting in the way If you're coming back in, just do it... Moron Substitution! Is he really coming back? - Hanamichi... - Are you ok? Why do you guys look so concerned? Did you miss your best player? I'm talking about me, of course To beat an opponent like Yamao someone like me is perfect Gori, let's win this! They're nothing but a stepping stone to advance in this tournament - A newbie like you doesn't have to tell us that - What? Shohoku (71) - (76) Sannoh Hey, come here! We know that they'll press again They're coming for me In that moment you take the ball Rukawa, Run and don't stop until you get to the basket Sure - Captain, help Rukawa - Okay... Listen... We can do this Captain? 1,2,3... WIN! Sannoh, are you ready? Let's go - They are serious - They really think they can score 5 points in 1 minute? Let's go Shohoku! - Defense! - Defense! He's open They're going to score! Fool! - Let's go, Mikio! - That's the shot! RUN RUKAWA! Good, he's covered! It was a fake! Basket counts 3 points, foul number 6! One free throw! Shohoku (74) - (76) Sannoh - Shohoku! - Shohoku! What a shot, Mitsui Thank god I got in Shohoku's team... We can feel the victory It's obvious that they haven't given up And that they trust in themselves and their abilities Shohoku (74) - (76) Sannoh Shohoku (75) - (76) Sannoh - 47, 46, 45, 44..! - Defense! Don't let them score! Come on! Sakuragi, you can do it! Miyagi... Rukawa... Let's go Mitsui! You can do this... Akagi! Score! Give it back STOP HIM! GO AFTER HIM! It's over! Shohoku (77) - (76) Sannoh Yeah! LET'S GO! How was the match against Sannoh? It was hard I was scared Ryota... What...? Welcome back, son I'm home - Are you taller? - What? Of course not, it's only been 4 days Take this It was from Sota Ryota! - Welcome Ryota! - What are you doing? It's okay... The experience from a loss Is always a good lesson Give me the experience that I need Have you noticed anything different since you came overseas? Everyone around me... are all as big and athletic as Kawata What will be your role on this team? I'm small so I'll be playing point guard I don't want to put extra pressure on myself
