Just camp in the countryside for recreation. For them! You know how they live Orion? A little food on their table Few rags to keep warm their children. Knowing the future they have. Life is already hard enough for them no one like you. I too am a man. Every day less. I learned something here, Orion. That my life is more valuable than others. Do not you see that? Is not that right; It was the power in only seeking. I gave up long ago believing that you do not love. I thought it would claimed forever. I have to do with the logic now. I remember that were very reasonable. Let us return you something old Chofrax! I wish you a good return. And Convey my respect to Ankaris. Kill! No! Now Ankaris will see that we are strong enough to put... ... The "bravest". And a warning, not other slave caravans. Otherwise the next time the loop will be more firm. There will be some more time. And when he comes, Loop is around your neck. Ethmpek! It loons! Peasants! Were peasants who waited but we found an army. And your own army massacred from villagers and a girl. Girls more loudly than you think. It is possible to think that at the end will win? If you want to know what you think... ... ask him. He is strolled with her in the forest. When you hostage strolled when they tell you to lounge about. Honestly believes that the villagers is as good as we do. Let's see if close enough to take in the trap. When you hang loved of villagers in the square. Hanging innocent people? Villagers not people. Or is soulatso together changed your minds? You know my devotion my Lord. Course. And to be rewarded for it will lead the first run. And you? ... ... I will erect trap Atheleia. Why? What have we done; Enough! We did not do anything. And to prevailing when you were a baby. And Atheleia well. The Ankaris thinks he can help her. Calmly with it! - You will not come. - You come. My stomach dies of anguish. And if you do not come? Come! Came! Seal the gates! What if there are other nuns here and ask us what we are? Just say "bless" and go! Bless! Bless! We came to bless death row. We came from very far away. The nuns want to bless prisoners. Let the pass. You came in very dangerous part, Sister. The risk does not employ those serve a higher purpose. Sister! Sister! You can bless my sword? Sister! He wants to bless his sword. Bless on it, then. May... May this sword... Do not pray for them the old souls Sister. Pray for the poor to live... Do not say anything my son. May this sword become... Remember the blessing Sister? I can not bless in the hands of a soldier. May the sword beating only freedom. What kind of blessing is this? Grasp! Let's get out of here. Do not worry about me turn the camp. So you say? Ethmpek no! We can not lose you! I told you that will meet again. You can slept well. They do not torment guilt at nights. Always impressed, They found on the wrong side blame others That they are guilty. I'm sure you want to open your eyes And see what happens to you. So that you decided to win a woman. I guess this is my chance To repay your grace And to see bare from your dignity. Oh! How beautiful disgusting spectacle! My father said that I track. Course. You will hurt much? There is pain kneeling them. It's fear. Knowing how is absolutely helpless. Are you helpless? Is not that right; Can I ask you that pleases me. And thou you can not do anything. I like this when I become Queen. You would never become Queen. You better tell us for the scepter now. Kantin speak. This looks wonderful inconvenient. Is not Atheleia? It is very inconvenient? Old spoke then. 'll Talk again. Very soon. Now you want to tell us, Atheleia is not it? Tell us. Tell us the scepter. Please Atheleia, not want to happen to you something. May need a little more persuasion. About falls so every time. Say about three more times and will become extremely more inconvenient, Than it is now. We'll let Atheleia to think about what you want to tell us. Before pull this lever three times. Come treasurer, we have dinner. Come treasurer. It is possible, my Lord, but I am stronger. Suffers too. Take care so as not to die before to tell us everything. Okay! We know what want a couple of days. But I have no intention to kill either now or later. No. Will continue my pays for too long! Orion the Atheleia runs away. I wish I had not trusted never secret. Father, give me a sign if you're alive or dead. Very touching Do you really believe that? What are you doing? Get. If you are afraid to save yourself with the scepter, Then you definitely will not give his secret to us. So the Ankaris will not hesitate... ... Give me leave to kill you. I intend to do it very slowly. The scepter secret should remain a secret. Someday someone will come stop you. Who? Someone you tangible rebels? My soldiers will march an hour to hunt them. Seems not to care. But you at least wish him good luck in Orion. Who will lead enterprise. Much like impatient to prove himself. Where were you last night? Where?... Here! I came in looking for. The Atheleia escaped. I heard. It was when I went out to walk a little , Over the ramparts. You go there often? I will come to walk together overnight. I have nothing to do when miss.
