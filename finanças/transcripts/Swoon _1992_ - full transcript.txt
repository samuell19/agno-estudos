[soft orchestral music] [birds chirping] [lively orchestral music] - My blood rose in my heart. I threw myself at her feet and began to cry. - [laughs] Tears, too. - She began to laugh. Oh, this laughter was frightful. - [Woman In Silk] Leave me, I don't want to see you again. - Oh my God, I will do whatever you command, be your slave, a mere object with which you can do what you will, only don't send me away. I can't bear it, I cannot live without you. I embraced her knees, and covered her hands with kisses. - [Woman In Silk] Yes, you must be a slave, and feel the lash, for you are not a man. - She said calmly. She said this with perfect composure, not angrily, not even excitedly, and it was what hurt most. - Now I know you, your dog-like nature that adores being kicked, and all the more, the more it is maltreated. Now I know you, and you shall come to know me. - [Woman] She walked up and down with long strides. - While I remained crushed on my knees. My head was hanging supine, tears flowed from my eyes. Sit down. - Hello, Nathan. - [Woman] Babe! - We're late. [soft orchestral music] [light orchestral music] [glass shattering] - [Nathan] Hey, you! Come on! [both laughing] [romantic orchestral music] - If I do what you want. - I'll do what you want. - [Nathan] March 4th, 1923. Dick threw a brick through the Paulson Drugstore window. June 21st, 1923. Train ride to the Loebs' summer cottage. Private compartment. September 9th, 1923. We burned a building near the train station. We watched the firemen extinguish it. October 13th, 1923. I've waited six weeks since our last crime. He's letting me down again. [lively instrumental music] - I'm leaving! - Fine, go. - Don't forget to go to the store. - [Nathan] I won't. - I'm inviting the girls over tonight. - Whatever. [camera clicking] Mm, that's nice.

May 16th, 1923. Spent the day avoiding Nathan, reading "True Detective." After we collect the ransom I'll go to Mexico, and then come back to be a bootlegger. - [Nathan] September 28th, 1923. We broke into a fraternity house and stole a camera and a typewriter. Dick says we can use it for the ransom letter. - [Dick] May 20th, 1924. Nathan bought a chisel and 30 feet of rope. I'm afraid he'll ruin everything. Who are you addressing it to? - Dear Sir. [ominous music] [typewriter keys clacking] - Hi, this is Dick. Babe and I want you here for drinks at 10. If you don't come, we'll shave your head. - Don't. We still have errands to run. - Lighten up. You got what you wanted. [typewriter keys clacking] This is Dick. Babe and I want you here for drinks at 10. Be there, bye. [suspenseful music] Wait, lemme see. Okay. Now we just have to find someone to kill. [laughs] [soft old-fashioned music] - [Announcer] President Calvin Coolidge today stopped in Chicago as part of his cross-country tour. He spoke to the citizens of this great city of crime regarding the menace of gangsters, the corruption of bootleggers, and the failure to follow Prohibition. - October 10th, 1923. Mother died today. I am no longer a Jew. My mother opened my mouth very wide and put something in it that tells lies. I am not a Jew. Such a nice thing to put in the mouth. - [Dick] October 12th, 1923. Nathan Leopold says he's not a Jew. Well neither am I. My father married a Catholic. - [Nathan] November 21st, 1923. I went to see Cecil B. DeMille's 10 Commandments today. People are fools, I'm an atheist and pleased to say that there is no God. December 25th, 1923. Dick and I argued about the boy. He wants to kidnap his brother and collect the ransom from his father. He wants to be a pallbearer at the funeral. - [Dick] December 23rd, 1923. I don't think Nathan will go along with kidnapping my brother. He only likes to read about it. - [Nathan] April 16th, 1924. Went to the Edgewater Beach Hotel with Dick Loeb and Germaine Reinhardt. Dick played roulette. Germaine rolled her stockings below the knee. April 19th, 1924. Best time yet. Dick seemed to enjoy himself. - [Dick] May 9th, 1924. Nathan rented a gray Willys-Knight at the Rent-a-Car on South Michigan. He used the name Morton D. Ballard. [soft instrumental music] - [Partygoer] I asked you, are you still seeing that longshoreman, the one with all the hair on his back? - [Partygoer] Of course, darling. You know, he's very wealthy. - [Partygoer] And you know that's what really matters. [all laughing] - So, Jenny, how do you play poker? - Well, there's a variety of poker games. This one's called five-card stud. - What is a stud? - That's a stud. - Oh. [laughing] - I'm so tired of this bloody card game. [door latch clicking] - Did you get the car? - Yes. [keys clattering] - Don't start. I waited around for hours for you when you went to get the rope and the chisel. - Oh, she's in a mood! [all laughing] - She's always in a mood. [all laughing] - [Partygoer] I know exactly what you're talking about. [all laughing] - Oh, no, forget it, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up. Start all over again. Aces high, deuces wild, jacks are bid at open. Got it? - I could use a jack. - Girlfriend, you look like you could use a jack. You're flat. - Well. - [Nathan] I am small. My heart is pure. [man speaking foreign language] - [Man] Repeat this phrase at the tone. [phone beeping] [speaking foreign language] - [Man] Repeat this phrase at the tone. [phone beeping] [speaking foreign language] - [Man] Repeat this phrase at the tone. [phone beeping] [speaking foreign language] - Oscar Wilde. Prince Eulenburg. Sir Roger Casement. Marcel Proust. E. M. Forster. Frederick the Great. [guests chattering] [alarm clock ringing] Dick. Dick, wake up. Wake up. We've gotta get it together. I dreamt of the great pharaohs of history. Of slaves being whipped. [whip cracking] I dreamed I was an Egyptian king, and Dickie was my slave boy. - Nathan fantasized that he and Richard Loeb were taking a sea voyage, were wrecked on an unknown island. Patient was the only one rescued, was able to speak the language of the natives. [whip cracking] A piano was rescued in the wreck, and he was the only one able to play upon it. No one on this island knew anything of music. The island natives were divided into two groups: kings and slaves. Nathan's companions were all made slaves. But because of the patient's ability to make music and speak the language, he was named a king. He then purchased Richard Loeb as his slave. He draped him in chains. He fantasized that Richard was sick when he purchased him, and that he would nurse Richard back to health. He then offered Richard three choices. - Yes, choices. First of all, I would set him free and remove the tattoo on his thigh. - He had a tattoo on his thigh? - A tattoo. We branded him in the locker room at school. His second option was to remain my personal slave in every sense of the word. And his last choice was to allow me to sell him to another king. But if I did, the other master would abuse him. And Dickie would send me secret messages begging to come back home. He would sign our pet name. - And what was that pet name? - Kitten. Pussy. [man whistling] [engine revving] [somber orchestral music] - [Dick] Bobby! Want a ride home? - [Bobby] Yeah, sure. - [Dick] Go ahead, get in the front seat. - [Nathan] Hello, Bobby. - [Bobby] Hello. [somber orchestral music continues] [tense orchestral music] [Bobby screaming] [Nathan gasping] [Dick grunting] [chisel thudding] [Nathan and Dick panting] [Nathan sighing] [tense orchestral music] [soft orchestral music] - [Woman In Silk And Pearls] Now I know you, your dog-like nature that adores being kicked, and all the more, the more it is maltreated. Now I know you, and you shall come to know me. - Do you think we should go back? - Relax, babe. It'll be more perfect if we just drive straight through. Those idiots'll never know what passed 'em. Honk the horn. [horn honking] - Well, we went on out to Leroy's fish and rib joint. - [Man] All the way out there? [horn honking] - Look here. - Yep. - [Man] Who are they? Who are they? - [Man] All right, get back to work, get back to work. - [Man] Man, last time I seen such a pretty boy like that out here- [shovel scraping] - Get out. Oh, he's dead all right. [laughs] He's getting stiff already. [lighter clicking] Grab the shoes and the shovel. [shovel clattering] [dirt scuffling] [car doors banging] [paper crinkling] [slow tense orchestral music] [branches creaking] - Nathan? You boys need help with that? - No. No, we're fine. Wine, we just spilled some wine. - Wait, Sven. Come here. You've just enjoyed the treat of shaking hands with a murderer. [all laughing] [soft tense music] So you want to go out for a drink? - [Nathan] Look, didn't I just tell you? What do I have to say to you? - That's the last time I take you any place. - Why don't you just shut up? [phone beeping] [telephone ringing] - Hello? - Your son has been kidnapped. He is safe. There will be further instructions in the morning. - Who is this? What do you want? - Johnson. - Good night. [wings flapping] [birds chirping] [film projector whirring] [bird calling] [animals chittering] [razor scraping] [flashbulb popping] - The man who wrote this letter was either an amateur at typing or a sadist. - May I help you, Mr. Leopold? I have several new specimens I'd like to show you. - Oh, no, thank you, I have to leave. - You see how some of the letters are punched so hard they're almost driven through the paper? Others were struck tentatively. [bird calling] [soft tense music] [phone beeping] - This is Johnson, listen closely. In 10 minutes, a car will arrive at your house, take you to the drugstore on the corner of Cottage Grove and 65th. There you will receive further instructions. You must travel alone, call no one. [both laughing] - What did he say? - I've forgotten the address. - [Announcer] Train from Des Moines, arriving on track six, all aboard. - Do you think we've waited long enough? - Yeah. Even if the traffic were bad, he'd be there by now. - [Man] Hello? - Hello, is this the Cottage Grove Drugstore? - [Man] Yes, it is. - [Nathan] Would you see if there's a Mr. Franks in the store? - [Man] I'm the only one here. - Just look. - There's no one in the store. - Are you certain? - [Man] Yeah, pal, I'm certain. - Where are your glasses, babe? [soft music] - [Announcer] Police go undercover in an attempt to apprehend the degenerate kidnapper of Bobby Franks. The mayor has declared a city-wide state of emergency. Police are desperately searching for the owner of the eyeglasses found at the scene of the crime. They announced that the ransom letter was typed on an Underwood portable. They suspect bootleggers, dope fiends, or perverts are responsible for the murder. At Hartford School for Boys, bachelor schoolteachers were taken in for questioning. - I would ask everyone in Chicago to look around him, and to note whether neighbors, friends, acquaintances showed signs of muddy clothes, shoes and so forth. Or muddy and dirty automobiles. And who was away from their usual haunt and calling on Wednesday afternoon and night. - I think whoever did it should be tarred, feathered, and hung. - I agree completely. Whoever did this must be some kind of deranged pervert, to kill a little boy like that. - Absolutely. - I still can't believe it, what a terrible loss. - It is. - May I be excused? - What for this time? - I just remembered, I have to stop by Nathan's house. - Again? - Yes, again. [hammer banging] - What the hell are you doing? How did you get in here, anyway? - You wanna get caught, don't you? If you could get pregnant, you would, wouldn't you? It's a typewriter, babe, it's a fucking typewriter. They can trace the letter. They can find us because you lost your glasses. - No. No way, they're common, the frame, the prescription. I mean if you think I should go to the police and claim them, it's fine, I have the perfect alibi. I took my birding class there Monday. - [Dick] No, no. I just got excited. Put it in the box, no one will recognize it. - There's also that rug in the trunk. Go for a drive? - One condition. I drive. - Fine. Great, just don't kill me. - You lucky shit, I can't believe you're leaving. - Neither can I. I shall sail on the Mauritania to Europe. I'll spend the ransom money in casinos, drinking. I'll visit all the great cities. I shall return to Harvard, become a lawyer, get married and raise a family. [ship horn blaring] [water splashing] [dog barking] - [Dick] May 23rd, 1924. Destroyed the typewriter, burned the shoes, hid the chisel, burned the rug and the clothing. I think we're finally finished. [flames blazing] [distant train horn blaring] [ominous string music] - [Nathan] May 23rd, 1924. Kelly and Bobby Franks together would join Richard and I for life. I wanted to murder the idea of suffering as my condition. I wanted to surpass the boundaries of intelligence for something more pure. [soft ominous music] - [Man] So, you would say that you're absolutely positive these glasses do not belong to you? - [Nathan] Yes. - [Man] And you're certain of that. - [Nathan] Definitely. - [Man] Why? - [Nathan] Those are not my glasses. - These are not yours? Very common frame, everyone has them, right? Let's see, you bought these from Albert Coe and company on May 24, 1923. The hinges, Mr. Leopold, the hinges are newly patented, rare. Only three pairs sold in Chicago with your frames. In fact, here's a copy of your receipt. - Well, Nathan, I suppose Detective Savage would like to accompany you to your house to find these glasses. - Let's go. [phone ringing] [elevator bell dinging] - Is everything all right? - I believe so. Your brother was going to show us his pair of glasses. - Babe, are you all right? Do you need a lawyer? - I'm fine, Mike. I have nothing to hide. [quirky instrumental music] - The girls' names again? - Edna and May. - What did they look like? - [Nathan] Edna had red hair, May was a brunette. - Exactly where did you pick them up? - 18th and Roosevelt Road. - What time was it? - [Dick] About six o'clock. - What exactly did you do with them? - We went for a drive. - Whose car were you driving? - My car. - Did you engage in any sexual relations with these girls? - Yes, we did. - Where did you drop the young ladies off? - Back at 18th Street. - What time was that? - About 8:15. - Did you engage in any sexual relations with these girls? - Yes, we did. - Where did you say you went, in Lincoln Park? - In the rookery. And we looked at birds. - What kind of birds did you see, Richard? - I don't know, Nathan's the ornithologist. - What'd you have for dinner? - How much did you have to drink? - What time did you get home? - I said, one o'clock. - Who was there? - My father. - How late did your father stay up? - At what time did you take Richard home? - Whose car were you driving? - My car. - What time was that? - Six o'clock. - The girls names, again? - Did they say why they took him in? - They think the glasses are his. It's impossible, Dad. It's a mistake. - That's right. A mistake. - Excuse me. Pardon me. I've brought pajamas for the young man. If you're gonna keep him overnight. - Yeah, fine, put them down. - You know, I'm certain they have nothing to do with the crime. They couldn't have driven anywhere. Least of all that swamp. I know, I was fixing young Mr. Leopold's car in the garage. - You were? - Absolutely. [children chattering] [soft music] - Richard Loeb? Come with me. [clock chiming] - Richard. - Yes? - Your alibi is a lie. There was no Edna, and no May. You and Mr. Leopold did not go looking for birds in Lincoln Park, just one small boy. Oh, Nathan's family's chauffeur just dropped off some pajamas for the evening. He mentioned, he's absolutely certain that he was working on Nathan's car the day of the murder. - He said that? - [Man] Yes. - Go ahead, eat. It's from the Berghof. - I'm not hungry. This was completely his idea. He's very clever. - Who? - Nathan. Nathan did all of this. He invented the fake names. He was Morton G. Ballard, I was Louis Mason. We rented a hotel room, for the address, and then went to the Rent-a-Car on Joliet and used the assumed names. I think I got that idea from a detective magazine. But he made the phone calls and he rented the car. - Where'd you get the money for the car? And the hotel room? - My allowance. - Why'd you kill Bobby Franks? - I didn't kill Bobby Franks. Nathan did. I don't know. He was a friend of my little brother's. Nathan wanted a little boy. He wanted Johnny Levinson. But we couldn't find him that day. He said his father was the richest Jew in town. - Both you boys are Jewish. - Yes. It was the money. You know, we knew the Franks lived down in Hyde Park, so we knew they could get the cash. - And after you finished, and you had the ransom, what were you going to do? - Nothing. Nathan was supposed to sail to Europe for the summer. He was supposed to leave today, in fact. [chuckles] I didn't care as much about the money. It was the planning. It was all going so well, up until the end. Do you read detective magazines? - No. Oh, yeah, what about the Rent-a-Car in Joliet? What about your assumed identity, Mr. Morton D. Ballard? Who do you think told me about Louis Mason? Your friend says you're the one who killed Bobby Franks. [Nathan exhaling] - Get a stenographer. - You're aware that there's some kind of talk that the two of you had homosexual relations. - Yes, sir. - And you're aware of the fact that you're thought to be the aggressor, in this relationship. - Yes, sir. - Which, as a matter of fact, was the truth. - Yes. - Now, in your original plan, did you have anyone... Did you have anyone to be the victim? - Nobody in particular. - When did you choose Bobby Franks? - When we saw him, by pure accident. - Now, this letter that you already prepared, and the envelope and the address where to deliver it- - Yes. - When did you, exactly, write that letter? - The day before. - And who was it addressed to? - To no one, just "Dear Sir." - Oh, so, it was after, that you chose Bobby Franks, that you addressed the letter. - Yes. - Now, later, in the swamp. How did you attempt to conceal the body in the culvert? - I think it was headfirst. I had a pair of rubber boots. - Was it much of a job, to push the body in? - At first I didn't think it would fit. But then after I started, it wasn't very hard at all. - Oh. - Richard helped me. - And so you pushed in as far as you could with your hands, and then you used your feet to push it in further. - Yes. [knocking on door] Hello, Dad. - I would advise my son to say nothing more. - "We turned the corner. Mr. Leo, Mr. Loeb put his hand over Bobby's mouth, and hit him over the head with his chisel. Bobby started to scream, so Richard seized him and pulled him into the back seat. He forced a cloth in his mouth." Apparently the boy died of suffocation shortly after. - Would you please read Mr. Loeb's statement now? - I was driving. Mr. Leopold was in the back seat. I stopped the car and asked Bobby if he wanted a ride home. He got in the front seat. Mr. Leopold grabbed his mouth and hit him over the head several times with his chisel, I do not know the exact number. He began to bleed and was not entirely conscious. He was moaning. - Okay, fine, I have some corrections. First of all, we started planning this as early as November, 1923. In the second place, the suggestion was his, not mine. The Rent-a-Car is not at 14th Street but at 16th. I did not buy the chisel with tape, he did. The rubber boots are not my brother's, but my own. At the time the Franks boy entered our car, I was driving, not Mr. Loeb. Mr. Loeb was in the back seat. It was Mr. Loeb who struck Bobby Franks on the head with the chisel, not I. Mr. Loeb returned to his home at one o'clock, not 10:30, as he seems to think. - No, I never said that, I said I went to your house at 10:30. There are certain corrections that Leopold had made that are not important. Such as, 14th Street. And the boots being his instead of his brother's, which doesn't amount to a damn. He wrapped the chisel, not me. And he doesn't mention the original plan to use ether to kill Bobby Franks. He was supposed to do that. 'Cause I don't know a damn thing about it, he chloroforms birds and things like that. He knows ornithology, and I don't know a damn thing about it. He did it. Nathan Leopold Junior. He was up in the front seat. I said he was up in the front seat. I mean I was up in the front seat. It's obviously a mistake, I'm getting excited. Look, I tried to help you out, because I thought if worse comes to worse, you'd admit what you had done and not try to drag me into this thing. That's all I have to say. - Those are all absurd lies. He's trying to get out of this mess. I was driving the car, I'm absolutely positive. I'm sorry that you were made a fool of, and broke down and ruined everything and all that. I am sorry, but it wasn't my fault. [whip cracking] [gavel banging] [soft tense music] [flashbulb popping] - Richard, what about your family? - My mother doesn't believe it. Even now, I'm sure she doesn't think I did it. That hurts. A mother's faith, a disgrace to my family. [flashbulb popping] I could've carried this secret in my mind the rest of my life, it didn't bother me much. A thought or two at times, that's all. - Today, the amazing case of Angel-face Loeb and Mastermind Leopold will be heard before Judge William Caverly in Chicago City Court. Veteran defense attorney Clarence Darrow avoided the jury by admitting the guilt of his clients. After Sigmund Freud declined to examine the boys, Darrow hired the best alienists in the country to study the deranged duo. - This compact existed for over a year. Do you want me to be specific? - [Clarence] Absolutely. - [Judge] You may proceed. - Nathan was to have the privilege of inserting his penis between Dickie's legs, [crowd exclaiming] at special dates. At one time this was to be three times in a month, if they continued their criminalistic activities together. Later they had a tremendous fight, and then it was once for each crime. - Your Honor, I do not suppose this should be taken in the presence of reporters or women. - [State's Attorney] He's your witness, Mr. Darrow. People have a right to know about their perversions. - Sustained. I want this court cleared of women. [women exclaiming] [gavel banging] I want every woman to leave this courtroom. [gavel banging] I have asked the ladies to leave, now I want you to leave. If you do not, I will ask the bailiffs to escort you into the hallway. There's nothing left here except a lot of stuff that is not fit for you to hear. [crowd chattering] [gavel banging] [gavel banging] [soft orchestral music] You are permitted to go into every detail, Doctor. - Where was I? - You were discussing Dickie and Babe's pathology. - Your Honor, if the defense is proposing that thees bloodless murderers are insane, I call for a jury. - Overruled. Continue, Doctor Bowman. - They experimented with mouth perversions. Nathan has many fantasies. I would like to say that this whole thing is just an absurd situation, because there's nothing but putting his penis his friend's legs and experiencing some sort of a thrill. He says he gets gets excited anticipating it. Dickie would pretend to be drunk, and Babe would undress him. - [State's Attorney] I object, these killers are grown men, Your Honor. Not Dickie and Babe, for God's sakes. - Overruled. Continue, Dr. Bowman. - [Dr. Bowman] Babe blackmailed Dickie with his knowledge of other crimes. He threatened him with exposure if Dickie did not submit to it. And Dickie had to go along with Leopold. [gavel banging] - They stripped the body as planned, poured hydrochloric acid over the face, penis, and an identifying scar on the abdomen. Some of the hydrochloric acid ran into the mouth, discoloring the face. They hoped the acid would dissolve the boy's identity. Richard said he had a brother who had a peculiarly shaped penis, he thought. And it was that feeling that made him think of using this method to prevent identification. - His first actual sex experience, namely, the use, or misuse, of his organ, was on a boy, Henry, two years older than himself. He masturbated by rubbing his genitals with a towel, producing an erection and ejaculation. This quite interested the patient. The two boys saved the discharge and put it in a jar. Later, they lost interest in it. - Nathan, you have to admit, smart or not, you're in a huge mess. - Listen, I don't feel sorry for myself. I did it and that's all. I feel terrible for my father and my brothers, but not for myself. Life is what we make it, and I appear to have made mine exactly what it is today. [flashbulb popping] - At night, he would lie on his side or stomach, with his arms under the pillow, hugging the pillow, and he would notice a warm smell, which would be partly from the pillow, and partly from his own body. He regarded this odor as extremely pleasant. At about the same time, he developed a great love for the symmetry of the human form. [gavel banging] - He does recall the story of how the robin got his red breast. Namely, that when Jesus was on the cross, all the animals in the world, except the fish, came there to mourn. One tender-hearted bird tried to pluck the crown of thorns and was stabbed in the breast. And became covered with blood. The patient is not clear whether this blood is from the bird's own heart or whether it's from the head of Christ. The boy acts as if he were a law unto himself alone. [soft emotional music] - During the trial, on a porch across the street from the Franks' home, we found a human head, two withered human arms, and a single discolored leg arranged in the shape of a pirate's skull and crossbones. There was an envelope between the elbows of the two arms, addressed to Chicago, City of Crime. The note said, "If the court don't hang them, we will." It was signed, KKK. [gavel banging] - It's too bad you didn't get to them before I got them. Then they wouldn't have said anything at all. And this murder would be unavenged. - Strike that out. - It's not the enforcement of law, to capture people and compel them to talk. - We didn't compel them to talk. - [laughs] No? - No, they began talking, we couldn't stop them. - [Clarence] Yeah, well I know about that, too. - They wanted to show how really smart they were about their perfect crime. Your Honor, bearing in mind the testimony which has been whispered into your ear by the defense alienist concerning fantasies, I would remind the court that the basic motive in this case is the desire to satisfy unnatural lusts. Your honor, you have before you the coroner's report, which says that when little Robert Franks was examined, his rectum was distended by this much. - I object, I strenuously object. The coroner's report absolutely refutes any implication of sexual abuse to the boy. The body left in- - [Judge] Your objection is sustained, Mr. Darrow. There is no evidence to support sexual abuse to the child. [flashbulb popping] [gavel banging] - I didn't want any mistakes this time. Look at me, if I walked away this minute, none of you could tell me what I'm wearing. I'm wearing a gray tweed coat. Dick is in a black suit and a white shirt. - Oh, shut up, Babe. [soft music] - [Announcer] Due to protests by the local League of Women Voters, women were allowed in the courtroom for the final address. - The coroner's report says that he had a distended rectum. From that fact, and from the fact that his pants were removed, and from the fact that these two are perverts, I have the right to argue that they have committed an act of perversion. [crowd muttering] These two inverts shall pay the penalty upon the gallows. And when they realize this, you will find that they have emotions. You will find that they have fear. And you will find these cowards will have to be carried to the gallows. In the name of the people of the state of Illinois, in the name of the fatherhood, and the womanhood, and for the children, we are asking for death by hanging for these two cold-blooded murderers. Do not let them go free or allow their spawn to be thrown to society. [gavel banging] - [Announcer] Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb received sentences of life plus 99 years in a decision which outraged the public. [soft tense music] [dramatic banging] - [Man] Nathan Leopold's criminal nature can be discerned in the contours of his face. The slope of nose and the tilt of his chin indicate his cunning and deceptive nature. Although he blames Richard Loeb for the murder, his profile proves him a compulsive liar. The patient's sexual pathology can be detected in his abnormally large pineal gland. It was this unfortunate imbalance of his sex urges which compelled him to kill without feeling. Richard Loeb's low sense of self-esteem is revealed by the shape of his forehead and the curve of his lips. His fascination with crime and a lack of moral values can be directly attributed to his upbringing by a Catholic mother and Jewish father. Due to a subnormal pituitary gland, he was unable to resist the powerful influence of Nathan Leopold. It was this unfortunate deficiency which led him into crime. And subsequently destroyed his life. [clippers buzzing] [soft tense music] ♪ Richard, Richard Loeb - [Nathan] Get the hell outta here, Boyd. - [Boyd] What's the matter, pretty boy? You miss your little boyfriend? - [Nathan] Scram, you better stay the hell outta my way. - [Boyd] Oh, little pussy boy-killer's gettin' tough. [dramatic banging] [whip cracking] [whip cracking] [whip cracking] [heart thudding] [ominous music] [door banging] [bars rattling] - [Man] Leopold, hey Leopold. You hear about your old man? - No. - [Man] Well he kicked the bucket. [whip cracking] - [Nathan] January 3rd, 1929. After my father died, I was abandoned by everyone except for my aunt and my brother Mike. [inmates laughing] I spent my days studying languages, reading, thinking about Dick. - [Dick] December 14th, 1935. I've been in prison for over 10 years. I was locked in the hold for fighting with James Day. I'm afraid of him. He's out of control. I was abused in prison, it was a very pleasant thought. I enjoyed being at looked at through the bars because I was a famous criminal. [water running] [prisoners chattering] [ominous music] ♪ Richard [man grunting] [razor clattering] - [Man] Hey, James Day, whoa. - Forceps. - Forceps. - [Man] Blood pressure's dropping. Pressure, I need a sponge. The artery's still bleeding. Blood pressure's still dropping. We need pressure. Another suture, quickly. Forceps. Quickly. Quickly, I need a clamp, clean this wound. Another suture, quickly. His temperature's dropping. We might lose him. [heartbeat thudding] - The warden has given him permission to be here. - [Doctor] He's gone. We could do nothing to stop the bleeding. - Would you like me to perform last rites? - [Nathan] No, he's Jewish. [dramatic banging] - Now, tell us what happened in there. - He pulled a razor on me. Sick faggot. Told me it was my turn. He'd been after me for weeks. He offered $20 to suck me off. - Watch your language, son. - Well, I pretended to go along with him when he told me to take off my clothes, then I caught him off guard, kicked him in the balls. He dropped the razor. We wrestled on the floor, I got control of the knife. And I cut him. Blood flew all over my face. Then I slashed him again, he fell against the sill of the shower. Then I reached over and I turned the hot water on, and he slumped against the wall. Then he got up, real slow. His eyes were big and starry. He put everything he had into a lunge at me- - I don't believe a word of it. I know for a fact that Mr. Day attempted to solicit Richard Loeb. And Richard refused. Look at the boy's record, he was the one who had to be removed from Richard's cell. He was out of control. His past record indicates multiple counts of sodomy and assault. - [Announcer] Richard Loeb brutally slaughtered. Boy-killer gets his due. Prison fight ends in death. - Dickie Loeb, a brilliant college student and master of the English language, today ended a sentence with a proposition. Loeb caught his loved one alone in the shower. The Negro was apparently defenseless against the youth, who still thought himself the embodiment of the Nietzschean super-man. Dickie Loeb approached the fearful Negro prisoner with the same smile that had proved so fatally charming to Bobby Franks. When he had the Negro in the corner of the shower stall, Dickie threw himself on his knees before the naked black body and clutched his captive around the legs, determined to satisfy his lust. All he got for his shower of kisses was a shiv between the shoulders wielded by the powerful arm of the black man who was revolted by the touch of Loeb's slobbering lips. [Nathan wailing] After a brief trial and 50 minutes of deliberation by the jury, James Day was found not guilty. [water sloshing] [soft orchestral music] [Nathan sobbing] [dramatic banging] - [Nathan] March 4th, 1936. For six months I was kept locked up in the St. Marion as the murderer of Richard Loeb. The following year I was constantly escorted by prison guard. [dramatic banging] [soft music] - Now I know you, your dog-like nature that adores being kicked, and all the more, the more it is maltreated. Now I know you, and you shall come to know me. [knocking on door] - It's open. - They sent me in here. - No, I sent for you. Take off your shirt. If I fog your x-rays, you'll get a better work assignment. It looks like asthma. Step behind this curtain, please. Ladies and gentlemen, that is my prepared statement. Now bear with me for a moment. There are one or two things I would like to say off the cuff, as it were. In my religion, the Jewish religion, we have some very beautiful prayers. One that has always been my favorite is the Kaddish. It begins [speaking foreign language], which means, magnified and sanctified, be his great name. The very word Kaddish means sanctification. For a good many years, I wondered why this long, lovely prayer, which is said at the close of all Jewish religious... - [Man] Nathan Leopold moved to Puerto Rico immediately following his release from prison. He had been in prison for over 33 years. In Puerto Rico, he worked as an x-ray technician and married Gertrude Feldman Garcia. He frequently defied his parole responsibilities, drinking, staying out past curfew, communicating with prisoners and ex-prisoners. Frequenting houses of prostitution. Keeping guns for birding. Traveling without permission. In 1956, Meyer Levin fictionalized his life in the novel "Compulsion." A film based on the novel appeared in 1958. Nathan Leopold tried unsuccessfully to sue Meyer Levin for willful misrepresentation of his character. He died on August 30th, 1971, in the Memia Hospital near San Juan. He had willed his eyes to the University of Puerto Rico eye bank, and his body for research. Immediately after his death, his eyes were successfully transferred to a blind woman.
