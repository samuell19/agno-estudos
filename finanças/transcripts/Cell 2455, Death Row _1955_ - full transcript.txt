Cell 2455, Death Row. This is the autobiography of a condemned criminal, a book brilliantly written that has appeared high on the list of best-sellers. A book that openly confesses the many crimes committed by the most notorious juvenile delinquent in recent years. A book written against a date with death in San Quentin Penitentiary, California. This is the living room of 4,000 convicts. These are the bedrooms. Men live here, year in and year in out, counting the days, hoping for parole. But for those inside this cell block, there's little hope. For this is death row. This cell 2455, the date is July 29, 1954. 50 times I've heard that elevator take men on their last ride. And I'm next. I want to have a last chat with you alone. You got everything in order? Yeah, I think so. It's a simple will. I'm gonna leave the proceeds of the book to a couple of fatherless boys and their mother. That way she won't have to work and let 'em run the streets. - And, uh... - I wanna be cremated. And after that, oblivion. Well, the state can have their law books back now. I hope they serve the next guy as well. You've kept yourself alive with legal maneuvers for nearly six years. You've certainly had every chance the law allows. Chances. Yeah, but they've been narrow. I've been within a few feet of that little green room four separate times. Much closer now. You've accomplished something remarkable during your six years here. You've educated yourself right here in this cell. You've studied law. You know much more about criminal law than the average lawyer. Yeah, and I'm still here. But you can't claim that you haven't had your day in court. Oh no no, I've had that all right. You've become a well-known author. The critics have acclaimed your book. It's been read by thousands and thousands of people. Ah, the book's nothin' but the story of a failure, a book that can't even answer one question. What starts a man here? What brings a man to death row? I don't think anyone will know the right answer to that question in a hundred years. I'll live a hundred years. Between now and morning. Warden, why do they have to kill me? That'll solve nothing. Look, let 'em keep me in jail for as long as I live. I didn't write a book to save my life, I wrote it to help thousands of others who might travel the same wretched road. I wanna save 'em from the hell I've been through. I wanna write more, look I know what I'm talkin' about. Sure, sure, I acknowledge lots of crimes, but I'm worth more alive now than dead. That's not for me to judge. No. It's up to my fellow man. Oh, it's a slim hope now. You know, you can spend the rest of the night downstairs, play some records. No, no, no, no. I'll sweat it out up here, if you don't mind, Warden. After all these years, this cell is like... Okay, Whit. Thanks for comin' up, Ward. I'll be seein' ya. Yeah, I'll see ya at 9:30, Warden. What brought me here? Why am I here? Why did it happen to me? From all sides, I'm condemned. He's no good, he's a menace. Nobody is my friend. I'm a criminal, the worst kind. Why, Why, Why? I wasn't born a criminal. I didn't spring full grown from hell. So why am I here? I had good parents, loving parents. They gave me more than I ever gave them. I was a sickly kid and I had asthma since I was four. Dad moved the family from Michigan to the coast for my health. I can still remember my first night at Downtown Los Angeles. Dad used to take me to different street corners and we'd just stand there and watch the hundreds of people and automobiles go by. I think that's when I wished how someday I could have my own automobile, be the best driver on the road. We rented a small house, and Dad had high hopes for all of us. Yep, and I guess I never will forget the first time we went to the zoo. Big kitty, I called it. I remember I wanted to let it go free, but Dad told me I had to keep it caged. I haven't forgotten his words. Everything dangerous has to be caged. Things were going pretty good with Dad, and it wasn't long before he was able to make the first payment on a second-hand car. Mom! Mom. Mom! My nose was broken, but the worst had happened to Mom. Her spine was snapped, paralyzed from the waist down. - Whit. - Hm? I drew the death watch. I brought you some coffee. Thanks. Where was I? Mom's accident, a blur of memories. Five or six years of poverty, all of Dad's savings spent on surgery for Mom. But it was useless. She never walked again. Whit, Whit! Yeah, Mom? Your father, I smell gas! In the kitchen, hurry! Pa! What'd you do it for, Pa? What'd you do it for? Why? Pa, what'd you do it for? I'm sorry, son. And I saw those charity packages. What I saw in Pop's face that night was despair and fear, and I remember how scared I got. Scared of poverty, scared of what it had done to us. I had to find some way to help. When the folks questioned me about the extra groceries, I told 'em I had a paper route, and I got away with that lie for weeks. At what stage does a wayward boy turn into a delinquent? I guess you don't suddenly turn. You curve in. Jo-Anne was the girl's name. I'd watched her playin' the pinball machine at the malt shop every day for about a week. Usually had a couple of fellas hangin' around her, but on this day, she was alone. "When my boyfriends take me out, they have ears," she said. I was sure they didn't have any as good as the one I had just stolen. My, you keep your cars in good shape, Mr. Rockefeller. You ordered it, didn't you? Come on, jump in. What's the matter little boy? Big, bad policeman scare you in your stolen car? No. Where do you wanna go? Right straight to the end of the line. Where? I know a shortcut. Drive fast, crazy fast. Well, here we are. You're crazy, little boy. Yeah, crazy about you. Got a cigarette? Wish I had a drink. Sorry, the guy who owns this car forgot to build a bar in it. You know, I've been watchin' you a lot. I know. You've got pretty legs. Oh, you've noticed them. You've got a pretty mouth. Well, what did we come here for? To go crazy, I guess. You said I've got a pretty mouth. Why don't you kiss it? Hey, lookie! How do ya like that, lovers! Beat it, you guys. You, too. You fellas get outta here. Shame on you, Jo-Anne. - You know them? - She knows us. What are you doin', Jo-Anne, cradle-snatchin'? What do you think you're doin"? Lay off, will ya? What? That shows you how an expert works. Lay off him, I'll snatch you bald-headed! I'll take 'em both on. Well, listen to Buster. Leave him alone, he's an all right guy. He's a square, look at the car he's got. He kiped that car. Oh, so he kipes cars. Yeah, and knows how to wheel 'em, too. I was gonna introduce him to Skipper and the bunch at the shack. Hey, we need a guy who can collect cars and wheel 'em. If he's as good as Jo-Anne says, how 'bout a little proof. You want a fast ride? Yeah, that's the idea. Man, can he wheel! Didn't I tell ya? Put it to the floor, boy! Watch the corners, chauffeur! You're gonna drive us right off this hill. Where's he going, Whit, Whit! Careful, Whit! Hey Whit, whadya say? Oh hi, kid. Here he is, Skipper Adams. Hey, this is the guy I was tellin' you about. - Yeah? - Ah, he don't look so tough. - Is this the guy? - This is the guy. You got a record? No, I haven't been pinched. Then what makes you think you're tough enough to get in with us? I don't know how tough he is, but he can be plenty useful. Should see this guy drive, he's great. I think he's yellow. See. How about your nose, boy? Atta girl, Jo-Anne. All right, all right, kid. Tell her, Skipper. So you wanna prove you got guts? Anytime you're ready. Okay, you'll get a chance. - When? - When I tell you. Here you go, Whit. These bullies were car thieves, shoplifters, check kiters, but they were stupid, too. I knew I had more brains than all of them put together. It was a wild run of crime for almost a year. That gun made me 10 inches taller. I'm sure you're mistaken, officer. My boy's a mechanical wizard. He spends most of his time when he's not in school taking the family car apart and putting it together. I think somebody wants to talk to you. Don't you hear me, son? Now just a minute, officer... Nobody's gonna hurt him, mister, now drop that wrench kid, drop it. We're going for a little ride, sonny. Officer. This'll break his mother's heart. She's a cripple, sir, bedridden. - It'll be very hard to tell her... - You oughta be ashamed of yourself. It's a bad bunch of kids, mister. Stick ups and store boosters and they kipe cars and give us a bad time. One of these days, they're gonna kill somebody. But my boy's not like that. Well, you'll have to tell it to the judge, mister. We picked up one of his pals, Skipper Adams. He racked up the rest of 'em name by name, put your kid at the top of the list. Whit, why don't you speak up. Tell this man it isn't true. You got nothin' on me, copper. You see, mister? They pick up that kinda talk in the comics, hear it on the radio, come on, kid. So I drew a stretch in the reform school with the others, fingerprinted, numbered, cataloged. I was furnished with a record that stuck to me ever since. You can't handle Skipper yourself. I'll soften him up for ya. You can have what I leave. We've only been in this joint since this mornin'. You sure this is the way you wanna start your career here? I'm sure. Just as soon as I can lay my hands on him. You stinkin' stool pigeon. Did you do this? - Nah, not me. - Then who did? Come on, names. Who punched this fella? - Santa Clause. - Oh, a wise guy. Is that a crime, too? Now you're makin' a good start for a new arrival. How many of these boys worked you over? Just one, him. You're a liar. Take him over to the hospital. All right, come on, come on, break it up. I warned you, Whittier, if you think you're tough, we tame lions here, The tougher it gets, the better I'll like it. I conformed to nothing. I drew one punishment after another and told 'em what to do with their rules. But in six months, I was warned and balled out 20 times and listed as an incorrigible. What's the matter with you? You're poundin' up a record an inch thick. It'll bog you down in time. When are you gonna grow up? Got them to give you a job in the office. And what happens? You use that privilege to juggle the files and put bad credits against other inmates you don't like. They had it comin'. You've stolen from the commissary, been caught gambling, smoking in the dormitory. You're full of resentment and defiance. You're on a downhill toboggan. Into a snowbank, sir. Into the penitentiary. At least I'll steer the course myself. Don't you do me any favors. I won't. Take it the hard way. 90 days in the brickyard. What are you tryin' to prove? I'm training to take on ignorant bulls like you 10 at a time. That's lunch, line up! Now, I know you got complaints about the food. Now, light rations and hard work is the order as long as you deserve it. It's up to you. At that moment, all that guard meant to me was another cop, another stupid authority tellin' me what to do. Boy if I'd had a gun that day, I would have emptied it into him. Take him! He needs to be fumigated. That was my first dose of tear gas, and I never forgot. I was still against authority, against society, against the law, but I vowed from that day on to yes everybody. To rub my nose in any kind of dirt, and get out. I finally got out, older, taller, wiser. Upon arrival in town of residence report at once to your parole officer. I've been over your record carefully, Whittier. You're gonna have to walk a tight rope from now on. You slip, you fall right into San Quentin. I'd like to ask one question, sir. Hm, eight more waiting, huh? No, there's no time for questions. You report here once a week until I think it's okay for you to come in only once a month. Now, you've read the rules about consorting with other parolees, getting off the streets at night, and remember, no liquor, no firearms. Why can't you cut a record of that? No listen boy, that's not the right attitude. I've got 70 like you that I've got to keep track of and more coming in every day. Now, I'll help you as much as you want to help yourself. I doubt that. - Now look, boy. - Eh, thank you, sir. Good day, sir. My answer to parole, to cops, to the devil himself is to strike first. The brand's on us deep, and we gotta fight back. There's no 10 commandments in this gang, just one. Don't get caught. Squares, here we come! All I want is the long, green stuff with the dead presidents on it. 10 robberies in a night. I'd stolen a short-wave radio and rigged it up to receive the police broadcasts. Robbers escaped in black... I always knew where I was going, the police didn't. I was in the dough, and when you have dough, you have a dame. I called her Doll. She could be a doll, too. All looks and clothes and feminine cuteness. But she could be a hard-boiled realist. I like both sides of her character and all points of her compass. What took ya so long? Whit, the cops tailed us. Are you crazy? What'd you lead 'em up here for? I couldn't help it. They didn't dog us till we got on this road, there ain't any other. What's the ignition on that car, jerk the wire. Hit the brush! We got time, we busted the ignition. Well I didn't get a chance to bust the two-way radio on my car. They'll cork up this road down below, hit it. Who's doing the driving? Cars, 63, 40, 10, to Flintridge Mountain Road and main highway. All speed intercept white squad car coming from hills. San Fernando Valley, Malibu, Santa Monica, all highways, all cars, police radio car number 34, repeat 34, stolen from patrol. Three men in this car, all armed. May head back into city, repeat. You guys couldn't catch cold. Don't come too close behind us. Calling Updike involving Flintridge Circle, X-Y-Z. Reverse battleship Normandy... I tossed him into using code. Three, 20, 10. Police are effective, Flintridge, Malibu. Repeat. That it, they're askin' for it! Did you see that, Whit? He went over the rail like a fractured duck, huh? One shot, that's all it takes me is one shot. Hey, come on. Good shootin'. Whit, wait for it! The gas tank, we're gonna explode! Let's get outta this car! Let's go! We're trapped! Right through the head, I think. No, this guy must carry a rabbit's foot. You only creased. But the rabbit's foot wasn't good enough to keep me outta San Quentin. That was my first trip in. Lemme see, it was in August, '41. The minimum sentence totaled 26 years. The maximum could be five lifetimes. Attention all men, attention. Warden Duffy'll speak to you. Warden Duffy. Hear this please. I've got some big news for every man in this prison. The State of California has just completed and put into working order an honor farm. You can regain your dignity as men. The aim is rehabilitation and a parole for you as soon as you're entitled to it. The name of this place is Chino. Mm, business is pickin' up. There'll be no bars and no walls. The only thing that'll bind you to Chino is your own word of honor until the authorities believe you're ready to go free. This is your chance, men. Good behavior'll get you there. That is all. You could grow old gracefully in a place like Chino. Live among the flowers, the birds, and the bees. Yeah, I don't intend to grow old in any joint. Hey Al, you gonna stay around LA when your parole comes through? Right close. I'm gonna give you a telephone number. Dame. Good lookin'? Yeah, she's all mine, remember that. They'll come along the minute I make Chino. Unless you get yourself jammed up again. Eh, not a chance this time. I've learned how to be careful. Well, stay outta trouble till I shake this joint at least. Let met me know the day you get to Chino. I'll be your outside contact. If I don't have along, gray beard and an ear trumpet by that time. I'll make it before you're on the streets a year. This stir's never seen the kind of good con I'm gonna be. I'll have so many credit marks, they'll wanna make me the chaplain. There were towers used by the plane-spotting details. They were quite a distance from headquarters. I promised myself I'd be up in one of those things in less than a year. Chino looked like a sugar-covered birthday cake to me. In a way, it was a birthday present. I had just reached 24. Took a long, long time before my smartness paid off. Regular airliner, 10:30. No, it didn't drop no bombs. We are lucky bein' here Whit, aren't we? Luckier when we get out. Eh, I don't know that I wanna get out. Beds are good, meals are good. It's comfortable here. I don't like it out on the street. I've tried the old world. Eh, the world's all right if you use it, make it pay off, grab it by the throat and shake it, slap it in the face a couple of times, turn it upside down, out rolls your bread and butter. Maybe a little cake, it's a cinch. If you're lucky. Eh, I make my own luck. Yeah, but crime don't pay. Pays off 87% to the smart cookies who never end up in jail. 87%, is that bad? Bad for the other 13%. That includes us, we're here. Eh, you belong here, boy, you're happy, don't wake up. You're expectin' that dame again, aren't ya? Yeah. Dames is grief. Not for me, they've been my best friends. I was married once. The trouble a lousy two dollars can get you into. There she is, right on time. Just picked up a light over in the brush. I knew you were up to it, I knew it. Ah, tonight I'm strictly rabbit, it's jump and run. Whit, give it a good, long thought. You're here on your honor. Me, I haven't got any. All I need is an hour. - Goin' over the fence? - Through it. I bought a pair of wire cutters last week. You mind a little blood? You tell 'em I fell through the trap door and cut my head. Whit, don't do this. You're gonna make it tough on the rest of us. You're gonna go along with me on this hour's delay, or aren't you? If you don't, I'll square you the day you get out. It's your party. And now, will you call the switch board? Tell 'em I fell through the trap, cut my head, started for the hospital. Tell 'em you wanna know how I'm comin' along. They say I haven't arrived yet, tell 'em I must be wanderin' around dazed, get it? You're dazed, all right. Tomorrow you can have my piece of pie. So long. Hi, Doll. Whit! Al, you old gray beard. Meet the Monk, my good left arm, straight as they come. Hiya, farmer. Hi, Monk. Everything okay, any changes? Just like we said, it's straight for town, let's go, wheel it. Wheel it? Yeah, I suddenly lost my taste for Chino. They haven't done away with traffic cops since you've been in. Yeah, relax. Okay kid, so I'm nervous. After you've been in as long as I have been... Who you talkin' to, amateurs? You sure they ain't tryin' to buzz around you right now? I got a good hour ahead. We've got a good year ahead. You're lookin' the pink, Whit. Feel good, I'm goin' a little gardening around the house just for the exercise. Look, I cut my thumb. Did you meet any interesting dames in that country club? They all had beards. How 'bout those lips I've been waitin' for? Well, after the big heat's off on you, we head for the mountains, lay low for a full month. Nevermind me. Just how hard are you, Al? The law is blind. They've been lookin' for me for two years, I've been here every minute of the time. You're safe here, it's a breeze. I've been readin' about you in the papers, Al. My last big haul? A pushover. Upstairs windows are never looked. I got myself a couple of handfuls of real ice in a big Bel-Air mansion. I'm fencin' 'em right tonight. We will be financed for a year. I used to know all the angles and all the double crossers. How well do you know this fence? How suspicious could you get in stir? I've done business with this guy 50 times, he's gotta be right. It's taken me a year to get here. I'd like to stay overnight at least. You're safer here than in church. I'll be back in two shakes of a cocktail mixer. With the olives. I think I'll take a shower. Make yourself at home. You got no business here. We know all about that, so open the door. I lost my key. Or maybe you got somebody in here. Now open up, will ya? I got no key, I told ya, I got no key! Well, you got the stuff you want, let's move on. You're a little too anxious, Al. I told you there's nobody here but the termites. Who's the extra bed for? I got a pet cat. Your pet cat just took a shower. Come on, kitty, slow and easy. You might catch pneumonia. Take a good look at this mug. I think he's the answer to the hot broadcast. He fits the description. Dark, curly hair, dark eyes, slight hump on bridge of nose. Right height, weight. You're news, son, hot news. Whittier himself. You got this guy all wrong. Oh no, we got him all right. Your next stop, Mr. On-a-Farm Whittier is Folsom. That dick was tellin' me the truth, all right. The next stop was Folsom, at a home of maximum security, the home of nightmares. If I had tried the wall, I'd be dead by now. A row of machine gun bullets where my belt oughta be. Almost four years of it. I hounded that parole board with weeps. Folks needed me for all their money troubles. Mom was sick, bore my responsibility. Any reasons I could think of to get outta there sooner. I was on the free side, but the old resentment against any authority was stronger than ever. Dependable Doll, that's you. Whit, be careful. When I have I been careless? I remember reading a story once about the wife of an air pilot. How Whenever her man went out on 3 mp' she died a little until she heard that he'd landed. That's how I feel about you. I always land. And I always die a little. Mammy, you're gettin' sentimental. What do you want me to do, sell shoes and gasoline? I wouldn't care what you sold. Now wouldn't that be a dumb life? Big thrill of a week, come home to a hamburger dinner with a blue ribbon from the boss for having sold more shoes in March than old man Tweedletooth. Sure, a dumb life. No kicks in it. I can be really stupid, can't I? Baby, if things get hard, we'll cash our chips and fly south. This'll be a cleanup year. - Just a year? - A year. There'll be no cheatin', mister. Tomorrow, I buy a calendar. I want you to promise me, Do", that whatever happens, any dough I can get to ya, you'll buy Mom and Dad things. You know, you'll go see 'em, fix 'em up. Nothing but the best is gonna happen to you from here on in, but I promise anyway, I'll see them. That'll be Monk and the boys. The door's unlocked. What's Dewey stringin'? I want my chips up. You sure they're hand-picked? The cream. They're what you asked for and more. Monk's known him for years, he wouldn't fool us. I wish ol' Al were out there. Won't see him for 20 years. Hello, Monk. - Hey, Monk! - Hiya, pal! Delivered as advertised. You know what I told you about my friends. They know all about you. - How are ya? - Glad to know you, nice to have so many questions and answers behind us. Monk says you have a patent on how to get rich quick, no exchanges. Well, it's no new technique, but it has the news late. Monk tells me you know all the better class joints in the county. Know 'em and been in 'em. Most of the runners for the syndicate and the rackets. Hey, those boys can be rough. They shoot straight. There's no copyright in shootin' straight. I'm making it plain. I get a few things around here I treasure. You're not using this apartment for a headquarters. I know a very old hideout, we'll use it. All right, now what's the full pitch? Hijack the hijackers. Thieves like us against thieves like them. So I'm a family. Nobody complains, nobody informs to the police, Law don't bother us because we don't step on the law's toes, plain enough? I'd wish you'd talk about this when I'm not in earshot. The law's one thing, but racket runners, not for me. Whit, you're the only one I care about. Let me know what is in the remains. How's it sound? Thieves like us against thieves like them. That's okay by me. Now I'm already dead. But I'll go along just for the glory. Check, this is a deal. We warmed up by heisting the messengers that carried the dough for the horseracing and gambling syndicates. Inside known boys, heh. Go on, get that hood up. Hey, come on! It's nine. He made five, we're lookin' for nine! Get up, hands up and stay up! Well, nice big bills, thanks. Johnny Albert's gonna have 50 rods lookin' for you cheap punks. You must be hopped up. Nah, just a little war between smart guys and smarter guys. The last is us. You better tell Johnny Albert to send 100 rods. They better be carryin' machine guns. We're hard to catch. Turn this heaper on, keep a gun in the seat. How do? A Mr. Do Re Mi and guests. I suppose Joe sent you. No, but Mr. Johnny Albert suggested we dropped by. Oh, Mr. Albert sent you. Oh, well, come in, come in. We have to be careful, you know. And after all, you do look just a little like, well, rookie cops. That, dear lady, is the supreme insult. Forgive me. And call me Blanche. Now, were you interested in any particular game? - Birds. - Rare birds of paradise. - No pheasant? - Or quail? Not the San Quentin kind. I'll show you around. These are our hostesses. Name your game, they play them all. Do you like what you see? Do you like what you see? - A gun. - Correction, a loaded gun. Keep walking forward, Blanche darling. Stop trembling. This can only hurt your pocketbook, or shall I say, Johnny Albert's? Okay everybody, hands in sight! You're supposed to have it on, now get it! Get a crew, right here, hurry up. Now let's head over there. Come on, you come on, gimme that necklace. I worked very hard for these rocks, you louse. Well work again, honey. You know practice makes perfect. All right Blanche, get the load up, you got somethin' to stash, let's go. All right, now outta here, let's go! Goodbye, Blanche! Don't touch any buttons, Johnny. Okay honey, you got off of his chair easy and quick. Wipe your mouth, Johnny, strictly business. You know what we're after. Three of ya, huh? You paid a social call on Blanche, am I guessing right? You're the same hoods that held up the boys in my treasure bar last week. Cheap punks. We're not gonna be so cheap tonight, Johnny. I can smell the stink of the jail tank on all of you. Make you homesick? Okay Johnny, on your feet. You goin' along with us, and we'll take the doll to keep you company. Get rid of him, Johnny. I won't be tied up in no drafty basements. Oh, we'll fix you up real nice, baby. Let me phone. Heh, don't kid us. Tomorrow you can use our phone. And tomorrow, your lawyer can start gettin' the dough ready. We can talk business right here. How much dough you asking? How much you think it's worth? I'll go 30 Gs. I keep a slush fund for just such an emergency. 30 Gs now, small bills. We were only gonna ask for 25. We'll do you a favor, we'll take your 30. With no hard feelings. Ah, we'll find it. Get it. In the second drawer. For my collection. Naturally, I had no intention of trying that. Against three of you. Oh no, naturally no intention. Duck soup, isn't it? You oughta know. Brought down many a duck. Sorry for interrupting your party, Johnny. Well, the alarm must've been hooked up to that drawer we opened. Come on, wheel it! Gimme that wheel. Okay, brace yourselves! Come on, take this wheel. Gimme that loot. We're hot now. Yeah, we'll we're hot from now on. The hottest set of characters ever crossed Johnny Albert and his mob. We're nuts if we go back to LA. Every ghoul in town'll be gunnin' for us. I just assumed I'd go pickin' buckshot outta my front teeth. How 'bout it, Whit? Ride to Glendale, Monk. Here you are. Splittin' it four ways thins it down, doesn't it? You sure you're not sore, Whit? Nah. We've had our kicks. Safer we split up. Australia, here I come. It was Africa a while back. That ain't far enough anymore. You guys ditch this hot heap and scatter. I'm goin' to Canada. Any use askin' you where you're headin', Whit? Leavin' California? I don't know, I'll find some mischief. You'll read about me in the papers. It's the cops, honey. Nothing to be scared of. Bail out, this is a stick up! Mister, listen, I only got a few bucks... Both of you, out! You stay here, honey. Don't worry. Oh, let go of me, please, let go! Keep movin'. Out of the car! Oh! Don't, let go! Please, let go! Stop! Ah, this is a stick up. Who is it? Open up, honey. Whit, it's two o'clock. Aren't you glad to see me, no greeting? Whit, I, I... Look, you can't stay here. - I just dropped by... - The police, they... - They been here? - No. No, but I'm afraid. - Some guys, goons? - No, no quit it. You're hurting me. Well look, nobody's been here, nobody's liable to come, what are you sweatin' about? It's what's in the papers. Robbery's one thing, but this other, this Red Light Bandit business. Those girls. You believe everything you read in the paper? There's a drawing in the newspaper, what he looks like. The law thinks you're this guy. What do you think? I've gotta go home, Ronnie. Oh, not yet, honey. Oh, Dad'll be furious. Let him be furious. What? Red light job again. Victim state of collapse, bandit driving a Ford. Probably souped up. Look for this Ford, dark coupe, late 1946 to 1947 model. Wanted man is a male Caucasian. Young, dark, curly hair, five feet six to five 10. Weighs 150 to 170 pounds. I sure wish that guy would pick on us. Four nights in these clothes. I wish they'd have picked you to wear this girdle. Hey, over there that. Coupe just pulling in for gas. Let's look it over. Spotted. Don't touch that wheel. All they got on us is some hot clothes and a car theft. I ain't gonna get chipped. I got 11 years parole on me and then some. I'd rather get killed now then rot in Folsom. Leave me alone! I didn't do it! Get outta here and leave me alone, I didn't do anything, leave me go! This red light thug we've been looking for used a .45. Victims swear it was a .45. Now let's count the score. Number one, the gun. Found near your car. Coincidence, .45$ aren't rare. Victims of the Red Light Bandit identify you. Look, I'm not even the size they claim, not even the weight. I've been misidentified, not identified, it happens all the time and you know it. You call up the victim, you say I got your bandit. He's an ex-con whose already confessed. What do they do, call the cop a liar? Number three, this pencil flash found in the glove compartment of your car. There's one in every car, you can buy 'em in any drug store. Number four, the car itself. Stolen car, description right, you driving it. Hundreds of car of exactly the same description runnin' all over the streets. Eh, you got lots of excuses, but not much of a case. You say there was a third guy in a car, he's your Red Light Bandit. He jumped out at the fillin' station. - You sure? - I'm sure. You say this third guy was riding in your car? Yes, he rode into the gas station with us. Caught a flash of you and jumped out the other side. - You swear to this? - Anytime. Huh, you're the best help we've had. What's this third guy's name? What? I said what's this third guy's name? Find out yourself. You're the cop, you lost him, I didn't. Okay. So now we've lost this third guy. Now we'll talk about you. Number five, you are a notorious police character notorious two-time loser. When the law wanted to question you, you made a fast run for it. Doesn't that look like you're guilty? Look, if I'd have stopped, and picked up with an ex-con and a car loaded with hot clothes, I'd have gone back to Folsom as a parole violator with new charges. Why wouldn't I run? Look, you're not gonna burn me for those red light jobs. - Come on! - I want him alive! Get him outta here! - He's a girl beater! - A sex fiend! Why don't you leave him to us, we'll get rid of him for ya! Turn off the lights for two minutes, we'll beef him! No extra charge for a broken head! The papers and the broadcasters had already convicted me of crimes that even these slobs hated. For five days the police had ran questions at me. Only I was turned over to the sheriff's custody. Move 'em outta here. Whittier? Franklin. What a bunch of pigs. My lawyer come yet? Take him to my office. There's gonna be a party workout. Chains, nightsticks, kicks in the head, I've heard of it! Well you two pitbulls aren't gonna get away with it. You leave one mark on me, and you'll regret it. I'll have every lawyer in the state... Suppose you take it easy for a couple of minutes! What about my lawyer? I don't talk without my lawyer. He'll be here, but first I got somethin' to tell ya. Well, it better be good, 'cause I heard the worst. No, I'm afraid not. Your mother died last night. That stopped me cold. I remember tryin' to say somethin', but no words came out. I hadn't been home in a long time. I didn't have enough nerve to face the folks anymore. Now Mom was gone. I never gave coppers any reason to be decent to me. I never gave any one of them credit for being kind untill that day in the captain's office. Hey look, Whittier, there's been no formal charges against you yet. DA's workin' on the list. I can give you a break. Don't put 'em back in the tank. I'll write you out an assignment to take him to the funeral parlor. I'd seen death before. But this was different. I remember thinkin', Mom, if I could turn back a little time. If I could speak to you again. But your pain is over now, all the pain. God knows I caused you plenty. I burned all the newspapers. She never knew. Doll. Yes sir, there's nothin' like havin' a bigshot lawyer. Big enough to raid a private interview in a captain's office. It has its advantages. Can you wait outside, please? You know I got the dough stashed. We can work this red light rap. We can tie that DA and his five-points evidence into a knot. All this identification testimony's pure bunk, pure baloney, you know that, don't you? Here are the papers you sent me. Names of the alibi witnesses and so forth. You may want to hang on to them. Don't you need 'em? It's not gonna be as easy as that, is it? It's going to be that easy for me. I wouldn't touch your money or your case if my life depended on it. Well my life does! They're tryin' to gas me, the little Lindbergh Law. Be sure and take a deep breath. Now wait a minute, I hired you! I got the dough, I tell ya! There's a limit even to what a criminal lawyer can stomach. You've been a vicious, dangerous man all your life. You've abused every privilege of social justice. Now wait a minute, I got rights! This is one of my rights. You haven't got a gun in your hand, and you've got to listen. You've robbed, wrecked, cheated. You've flaunted the laws of prisons in reform schools. You pedaled and fence with the underworld. You've beaten innocent men, shocked forever the minds of young women. You tried to kill law officers. You may even have committed murder. But now they've got you on the Little Lindbergh Law, and it'll execute you, and good riddance. Nah, that stupid law! Just for holdin' a gun on somebody and movin' a few feet, you call that kidnapping? They'll be executin' men for plain robbery if they get away with this! Doesn't my life mean anything to you? Nothing. Since when did any life mean anything to you? You drove your mother to an early grave. You're killing your father by inches, and you blame everybody, society, law, authority, poverty, and it's all a big lie. You're a living lie. Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Please, please, you're my only hope. Get out of my way. I told 'em all I wasn't guilty, that I wasn't the Red Light Bandit, but no one believed me, no one. What was I to do now? Are you represented by counsel? I wish to represent myself. You don't want to trust this to a lawyer? I don't. If you wish to try your own case, we can't tell you not to. May times, men with past experience such as you've had, you know the tricks of the trade. They've come before me later with the excuse of their inability to prepare for a defense. They wait for the last minute to get a lawyer, and then have him ask for a continuance just to stall off the case. Now, do you really want to try your own case? That's correct. - How do you plead? - Not guilty. The case is set for trial on April the 29th, 1948. Well, it's about time. You must think we're runnin' a law school around here. Ha, wouldn't harm any. You know I'm entitled a couple of books. You're getting everything that you're entitled to. But don't you think you're runnin' a good thing into the ground? No, I don't. My whole future, if there is any, is in these books. What's the matter with a public defender? He's fine. Nice old fella. He'll be around, for experience. You think you're smarter, eh? Well, I got more at stake than he has. But is there any harm in a guy tryin' to find out what makes him tic? You were a young pup, somebody wound you up with a crooked key, you've been runnin' backwards ever since. Yeah. That's not the way to win, is it? You oughta know. The date for my trial had been set. And my future was up to my own cleverness to twist the law to my advantage. I was alone fighting for my life. Only one man in the world had my total interest at heart. Only one man in the whole world would dedicate his life to save mine. The courtroom was another kind of jungle, the jungle of civilization where the intelligent battle to the death until the acquittal. This was the arena, the weapons were books and speeches, evidence and witnesses. I recognized weapons of legal combat before a jury. I remember looking each one of them over carefully, these 12. They were all good-styled citizens, carefully selected for their lack of prejudice. I was the grand prize of this battle, a novice entering a bull ring could not have felt more uncertain than I. A brilliant talker, the prosecutor set the stage when he told the jury that he would prove that I was the Red Light Bandit and would prove 18 separate major felonies against me. Under the Little Lindbergh Law, he would demand capital punishment, the gas chamber. Witnesses, witnesses, identifying, accusing, condemning me with gestures as well as words. As the case against me grew stronger by the hour and by the day, I looked in vain for one expression of sympathy, one ray of hope. I searched the faces of the jurors, and I looked for understanding and tolerance in the expressions of men from the press, but I saw nothing on those faces but scorn and contempt. Witnesses, Witnesses. I couldn't shake their testimony. A jury listened to them, fascinated. I wondered if that old saying was right after all. I was my own lawyer. Had I a fool for a client? Prosecutors closed summation to jury just now. Said Whittier's alibis were just dribble. No alibi at all for the crime of the 17th and none for the 22nd. Oh, hold your horses. Yeah, I think so, he's downright depraved. Yeah, positive. Here it is, yeah, DA quote. "To convict him of robbery is just like you going home. "Doing time means nothing to him." Wait a sec, here's something to quote. Parole violator, bestial crimes, morally wrong, lawlessly cold, calculating, vicious. Sure, he's a sadistic fiend and a cinch for the gas route. Okay, bye. Then it was my turn to address the jury. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury. You heard the prosecutor. I say to you here that I'm not guilty of the crimes ascribed to the Red Light Bandit. I say to you here, I'm not the Red Light Bandit, I swear, I'm telling the truth. I'd like to point out that these crimes were committed by a bungling amateur. The prosecutor says I'm a long-time hardened and professional criminal. Certainly, a man of my experience wouldn't be nervous with a gun, as the witnesses said the attacker was. I'd like you to consider the descriptions broadcast by the police. Male Caucasian, smooth face, young, dark, curly hair, dark eyes. This could be me. But it could also be thousands of others. The description also said five foot six to five foot 10. Weighs 150 to 170 pounds. Some of the victims reported the Red Light Bandit talked with an accent. Does this description fit me? I'm over six feet tall. I weigh over 180. I walked for over a day and a half. And in the end. The jury has found you guilty on 17 of the 18 charges, on two of which the penalty is death. Your Honor, aside from the automatic appeal to which I'm entitled, I move now for dismissal on the grounds of mistrial. As you know, the court reporter died two days ago before this trial ended. The law requires a proper transcript of trial testimony. I maintain it's impossible for another person to prepare from a dead reporter's shorthand notes a proper transcript of this trial. I shall take the motion under advisement. The motion was denied. I argued that I was being unconstitutionally convicted. The double death sentence held. They brought me here to death row, six years ago. Six years in death row. Six years in a living coffin. A coffin 10 1/2 feet long, 4 1/2 feet wide, my home, my office, fighting the law with the law, searching for legal miracles, writs, stays, appeal after appeal Four times to the Supreme Court of The United States. Hundreds of law books studied, thousands of words written, twice before now within hours of the gas chamber. I've already died 50 times. The night is gone, this is it. I can't show fear. But I am afraid, God in heaven forgive me. It's been all my fault. I know now what brings a man to death row. Not society, not heredity, not environment, only the man himself. I alone am to blame. You've done it again, Whit. No kiddin'. A stay from the State Supreme Court. I thought it was the bad news. Listen, did the judge make any comment when he granted the stay? Here, I took some notes over the phone. You'll be able to read the facts and the judge's opinion in the morning papers. Eh. Time, that's all I need. Over 100 more days of life. I gotta start on my new brief right away. The reporters are downstairs, they wanna see you. My pleasure. Anytime you say, Warden. I'll call ya. Whit filed his new brief, but The United States Supreme Court again refused to review his case. The date for his execution was once more set by the trial court. On January 11th, just three days before Whit was to die, the Chief Justice of the Circuit Court stayed the execution pending a hearing. So the story of this man is not yet over nor is the story of cell 2455, death row. Whether Whit descends to the gas chamber or whatever the future holds for him, cell 2455 still stands, ready and waiting for the next Whittier.
