THE HILLS OF MARLIK a film by Ebrahim Golestan Image: Soleiman Minassian Sound: Mahmood Hangwall Music: Morteza Hannaneh Today. Yesterday. Time without time. The breeze bears the smell of the pine trees. That flower becomes a fruit. A bird flew by. The village crawls on the slippery walls of time. And the earth is a woman with the dry stalks of scythed corn awaiting seed. On the road to Rudbar, beside the river Sefid, over hills of pine and olive, small villages with fields of rice and wheat, with men like trees, their roots deep in the earth. Today. Yesterday. Time without time. Here they had grown rice. A man loved a woman. So many thousand years. Many a flood passed through the vales. Many a field gave crops. Many a trunk added a ring. Many a man died. Many a woman gave birth. And the fruits of the earth went back to the earth. And the earth is a woman, asleep, with reveries and roots. A pulse. A dream. A glimpse. In the soft, dank darkness a living dream nudged him who dreamed, and who was dead. Till the dark end of history, a dream of flowers in spring. A bird watching the river flow. Those able, active hands. Watchful, earnest eyes. Beauty creating thoughts. They were there, with food and work and dreams, with pain and love and laughter, and life with its whims. One day laughter vanished, giving way to fear. Hoards invaded. Horror ruled. A despot described his vanity with the noble name of an empty creed. Blood flowed, the hammer burst the eye and the hand that brought forth beauty fell away. The hearth died and men declined, the helmet lay crushed, empty. History was lost. The mould dissolved and the skull that was the vessel of thoughts broke. A hand still holds the grain bin and the grain is no more. A womb dried. Pomp went to the grave and the fields grew crops to cover the graves. So many thousand years. Till the scholar stumbled on the scattered sherds, and tales of treasure, and picked up the thread of the past. So many thousand years. History has stopped. The eye which saw no longer sees. No grain of wheat remained in the bin, from the dried womb no life flowed and the spindle spun no more... But the perception of being alive, the feel of a pulse beat, the glimpse of a movement, crossed the borders of death, lived and became time. There is no time without life and no life without creating. Today, yesterday, time without time. What was his name? When was he? Who was the god whose altar he kissed? History and dead forms. The creator lives in his creation. He had the feel of life. He looked at the earth, He knew the joy of bursting blossoms. His wish was for a woman's kiss even in a thousand years, when of his clay a cup was made. And the earth is a woman, alive and giving birth. There is a spirit on the fields calling, "I, earth, am a woman with bountiful breasts, with the lust for increase, wanting seed, ready to give, awaiting the plough. Glory to him who scatters the seeds. Blessed he who poured the libation to life." This shows life: a sheep gave birth, the lamb took the teat, began to walk, became a ram, and tore down the leaf from the tree of life. Then came death. The corpse fell to the vultures and the wing-spreading eagle of an era fell. The body shrank, the womb dried, the spindle stopped and spun no more. The ear did not hear when the seed beneath the earth struggled to burst its skin. But the idea which has found form lives on and will remain. May the blossoms bloom again on the old roots, May the god of seed call again on the vales, May the eye see and may the vision bring forth new life. This film was produced at Golestan Film Unit.
