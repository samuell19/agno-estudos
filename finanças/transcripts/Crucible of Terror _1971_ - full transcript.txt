Oh, excuse me a moment. Hello there! - Hello, darling. How's it going? - Very well. Very well, indeed. - Not many people here. - Early days yet, George. They'll all be along later, don't you worry. There we are. - Oh. I see you're spending my money wisely. - Who's money? - You did say I could do what I like with my own allowance. - Did I, oh, poor me. Now, come on, Davis, show us around. - Honestly, George, I'm sure they'll prove a great investment. - So they better, for your sake. That money my wife gave was only a loan, you know. - Yes, I know. - I'm sure John understands. - What's this red star mean? - You know perfectly well that means it's been sold. - Well, there don't seem many about. Have you got any in business? - Well, no, these are basically new and unknown artists. - Ah, pity, I like in business, damn good investment. I made a packet out of mine. - Oh, this is exciting. George, don't you think so? George. - Yes, very good. Where did you get this? - From the artist. - Victor Clare, I don't think I know that. Is he young? - No, that's the funny thing, in fact. He's getting on a bit. - Davis, I want this piece. - George. - How much is it? - I'm sorry. It's already sold. - Who to? - To an American dealer. - Can't you tell him you changed your mind? - You know he can't go back on a deal, it's just not done. (glass shattering) - I'm awfully sorry, I didn't see you there. - Dumb drunk! - Why don't you throw him out? - Might be a little difficult. He's Victor Clare's son, Michael. Without him, I wouldn't have gotten any of the Clare pieces. - Well, perhaps he can get another piece for George. - I don't want another piece! - I'm sure if we asked this Victor Clare he'd-- - No, well, he sees no one. He lives as a recluse. He hasn't shown any of his work since before the war. - Stop bellyaching. I've already told her, I don't want just any piece. I want that one! - I think we'd better hurry, you'll miss your plane. George is going to Germany for a week. - I don't know. It's my money that's paying for all of this. - It's just a loan, it doesn't give you any rights. - No? by the end of the week or we'll see who's got any rights! - I'm afraid he means it. - I'll manage. - I hope so. (lips smacking) (cap rattles) - (chuckles) I thought I was supposed to be the drunk. Who were those two heavies you were talking to? Seemed to get you down a bit, who were they? - That was George Brent. - Oh. - Yeah. And his wife Joanna. - Well, you seem to be getting on all right with her, but I don't think he fancied you. I think he preferred blondes. (laughs) Well, what were they doing here, buying? - They're my backers. They lent me the money to buy all this stuff and set up the show. - What happens if you don't set it all? - What do you think? Still, they'll try to make a profit out of me. She regards herself as a sort of patron of the arts. - Conscience money. One of my father's favorite expressions. He'll turn to my mother, and he'll say, "Conscience money. "Most rich men have to sell their consciences "by buying pictures or being patrons of the arts. "But your father gave me you." You see, all his money came from her trust fund. He could never quite forgive her for that. Bastard. - Still, his work sell well. (chuckles) About the only things that have. - How much have we made? - Well, it's hard to say. Your cut should be about half a grand, I should think. - Oh good. - Well, it's all right for you. My share's all tied up in this other stuff. (suspenseful music) (seller shouting) (seller shouting) (people chattering) (suspenseful music) (hangers rattling) (seller shouting) (hangers rattling) (suspenseful music) (hangers rattling) (people chattering) (suspenseful music) You, uh. You did say there was a lot more of this stuff. - At the studio, there's no more like this though. He didn't do any more sculpture after this one. I don't know why. Plenty of pictures in there. - You don't think there's a chance of getting any more, do you? - Oh, no, no, no, no, no. - After tonight, I could sell anything by him. I got a pretty good price for it, too. - Oh, it's too risky, I couldn't possibly smuggle anymore. As I said, he'd go crazy nabbing you. - Come on. - I'm not kidding, you don't know him like I do. He can be pretty violent. You know, I think he could even kill me if he knew. (fingers snapping) - Listen, supposing I meet him and offer him hard cash. - Oh. Well, I don't know. It may be a possibility. I remember when I was down there last time, there was some talk about the trust wasting away. It could be that the cost of living is finally catching up with Victor. I can't see him economizing. - I'd like to have a go at him. - Might be a complete waste of time. - Look, Mike, I know I can sell your father's work quickly. If I could reinvest the takings from the sales tonight in some more of his work, I can make a quick profit and pay off the Brents. Otherwise, I'll never recoup that loan. - Well, when would you like to meet him? - It's gotta be soon. - We could go down to Jericho this weekend. - Where? - Oh, it's what we call the family, for want of a better word, seat. Jericho Valley. I haven't been there for sometime, I owe them a visit. And Victor's very keen on Jane. - [John] He fancies her, does he? - Who fancies who? - We all fancy you, darling. - Well, at least someone's enjoying themselves. How's it going then? - Oh, not too bad. - Don't you mean not too good? - Would you like a look around? - Oh, no thanks. - Well, perhaps you and Mike would like to come upstairs for a drink. I know Millie would like to see you. - Isn't she down here sharing in our triumph? - No. Are you sure? - No, thanks. I think we'll go while Mike can still walk. - I suppose I'd better be off. - This weekend then? - Well if you're sure you want to come, but I warned you, Victor can be pretty nasty. - Look, it's my only chance. - It's up to you. I know, bring Millie along. It may help soften him up. (soft music) (objects crashing) (footsteps pattering softly) (footsteps pattering softly) (sculpture grazing) (footsteps pattering softly) (hand cart rattling) (chimes chiming) (hand cart rattling) (dramatic music) (George choking) (George choking) (thrilling music) (George choking) (thrilling music) (George gasping) (dramatic piano music) (birds chirping) (tires rumbling) (door thudding) (footsteps pattering) (gate creaking) (footsteps pattering) (doorbell buzzing) - [Jane] Who is it? - John Davis. - [Jane] Yes, Michael, it's John. Look, do you think you could possibly muster enough strength to take the things down? We shan't be a minute, John. Look, by the way, I absolutely refuse to travel with Mike. Will you drive him? - Sure, he can ride with Millie. He can have a good old nag. (footsteps pattering) (birds chirping) - Come on, get out. - Why? - We have to contend with a bit of artistic temperament. I'm taking Michael. You can keep Jane company in her car. - Don't say they've had another row. What's the matter with those two? - The usual problems. - I suppose Jane's been on at him again. - What she wants is a good hiding. - How do you know? - I know women, so watch it. (Millie chuckles) (footsteps pattering) - Morning, Mike. - What? - In the doghouse again? - (chuckles) I've been there for so long, I'm beginning to enjoy it. (laughs) (doors thudding) (gate creaking) (door thudding) (birds chirping) (gentle instrumental music) (birds chirping) (gentle instrumental music) (tires rumbling) (gentle instrumental music) (doors thudding) (birds chirping) Mother? Mother. - My dear. - How are you? Looking well. (lips smacking) This is a friend of mine, John Davis. - How do you do, Mrs. Clare? - Where's Jane? - Oh, she's following in our car. Where's Father? - Working in the studio. You shouldn't disturb him. Please don't go up, you know how angry you make him. (footsteps pattering) - The prodigal returns, Father. No fatted calf? I think a little more emphasis on the high line. You know, Marcia, my love, I think you're putting on weight. (lips smacking) - Jane's here. - Here, let me give you a hand. - What? Here. - Hello, love. (lips smacking) - [John] Come on. (doors thudding) (wind howling) (Mike laughs) - I've had a word with the old man. I think we'd better leave it till tomorrow. There's no point in tackling him until he's in the right mood. How do you like the old place? - Well, it's very beautiful. Very strange. - Yes, I thought you'd like it. - You weren't kidding when you said it was remote. - Nobody ever comes here now. - Got a weird atmosphere, haven't you? - That's the souls of the dead miners. Used to be a tin mine. One of the biggest until the accident. - [John] Yeah? - There was this terrible disaster. They never recovered some of the bodies. Of course, no one would work here after that. They do say that the place will have stay haunted until their bodies lie in consecrated ground. (John laughs) Laugh all your like, but some people believe me. - Who? - Well, all the locals. Victor. And she used to, that Japanese bird. - The one from the bronze? - Strange woman, religious mania. She introduced Victor to this weird sect. They believed that the spirits of the dead had power over the living. They actually believed that a soul could takeover and transform living flesh. - You don't believe all that rubbish. The only spirits you believe in are pale brown and poured out of a bottle. - I'll drink to that. (laughs) (gentle instrumental music) (seagulls cawing) (footsteps pattering) (footsteps pattering) (wind howling) (seagull cawing loudly) (footsteps pattering) (suspenseful music) (stones rattling) (Millie gasping) (footsteps pattering) (suspenseful music) (Millie panting) (footsteps pattering) (suspenseful music) (Millie gasps) - For God's sake, be careful! You mustn't run around like that. These cliffs are dangerous! - Well, what were you doing scaring me like that? - What do you mean? - Following me! - I wasn't following you. - But I heard you. - I don't know what you heard, but it wasn't me. I've just come up from the house to look for you. It's nearly time for supper. - Well, someone was definitely there. - Oh, you're imagining it. The wind or a seagull or something. - Oh, I suppose so, it's just this place. I feel as if I've been here before. - Deja vu. - What? - That's what it's called, deja vu. It's quite common. Something to do with the brain getting out of phase or something. - No, it's not that, this is different. I've definitely been here before. - Maybe you came down here on holiday when you were a kid. - No. - Anyway, who do you think would want to follow you? Come on. (dramatic music) (wind howling) (footsteps pattering) - Better tell our guests dinner's ready. - Come and get it! Oh, here they are. - You, you don't know each other, do you? This is Bill Cartwright. Millie and John. Bill is my father's oldest friend, and his only friend. - Nice to meet you. - Thank you. - Nice to meet some of Mike's friends. Nice to see some fresh faces around the old place. I was just saying it's nice to have some new faces, Dorothy. I hope you weren't expecting haute cuisine. We live very simply here. - You're a super cook, Bill, and you know it. - He's had have plenty of practice. (chair legs rattling) - Well, here we are then. Bill's right, but do help yourself to wine. Jane, still as lovely as ever. And who are our guests? - John Davis and Millie. - Charming, absolutely charming. How lucky we are to have two such lovely young people with us. The young are so refreshing, aren't they? - Just what I was saying, Victor. - Bill, I thought that you were on interested in antiques. - It's quite a place you have here, the perfect retreat. - Oh, not perfect, Mr. Davis. Nothing is perfect, nothing and no one. That's the sad fact of life. Take Marcia, for example. Look at her, beautiful, isn't she? Now look at my wife, she was beautiful once. Weren't you, my dear? - Sorry, Victor. - Why have you bought that thing to my table? I've told you before, I won't have it! (utensils clattering) - Wonderful, this one is really marvelous. Look at the colors, the composition, the detail. - These are all very good. - Thank you, my dear. - Of course, I don't really know very much about art. Don't you do sculpture, as well? - I did once. - That must be very difficult. - Mostly just hard work. - Why did you stop? - Inspiration died. - Oh, what a shame. - Tell me, have you every posed for an artist? - It's fantastic! Line, draftsmanship. - John seems to know a lot about painting. - Yes, he knows a lot about art. - Really? - Yes, he organized a show only last week. - Did he now? And how did it do, this show? - Very well, I believe. (dramatic music) - Do you like the urn? It's very old, a friend gave it to me. Some sort of ritual ornament. - For blood. - Oh. It may have been, but more likely wine if I know those orgies. - These paintings are really great. Millie? - She seems mightily taken by my vase. I know, she shall have it. A memento of your visit. - No. - Oh, but I insist. - No, I don't want it. (vase rattles) - I'm terribly sorry. - Oh, I'm sure she meant no harm. - What more can I say? - I expect she's just tired after the journey. - I expect she's bored by all this arty chat and gone to find herself a drink. And I vote we join her, come on. - Jane. - You were very cruel to me at supper. - It must be catching. - Sorry. It's just my work, it's not going well. I'm tired of Marcia, she no longer inspires me. - Well, get rid of her. You never seemed to have any trouble finding new models. - But one always escapes me. - Victor, I've told you, I can't. - How old are you, my dear? - 24. - 24. The years are rushing by. Soon even your exquisite loveliness will fade. - Really. - Look, if you knew some unique treasure was rotting away, wouldn't you want to save it? - Of course. - Then why not let me start some sketches tonight? - Tonight? - Why not? - Michael would be livid. - Oh, Michael! - But Victor, I don't. (door creaking) (door slamming) (wind howling) (object rattling) (floor creaking) - Who is it? Somebody there? (floor creaking) (light switch clicking) - Are you looking for these? - Thanks. - Would you like a drink? - No. - A pity 'cause I don't like drinking on my own. Still needs must. (glass clinking) (liquor splashing) I'm surprised to find you still here. You see, Victor usually gets rid of his birds pretty regularly. No, no, no, no, I... I'm not really surprised that you've lasted the course because you really are very, very, very lovely. Sometimes I envy my father. Don't you find that funny? - Why should I? - Envying a psychopath. - Oh, don't be ridiculous. - Why not, I've had plenty of practice. - You said it. - One day, I'll show you. I'll show the lot of you. I'm every bit as good as my father! - Oh yes? We'll chat. (suspenseful music) (Millie screaming) (Millie whimpering) - Jesus. - Oh, John. - What's the matter, love? - There was blood all... I was covered in blood. - Steady on, steady. - Why did you bring me down here? - Well, I thought it would make a nice weekend for you. - I don't like this place. - Well, what's wrong? - Victor, look at the way he talked at dinner. - Well, so he's a bit strange. Living stuck down here for 30 years, I'm not surprised. - Strange? Do you know he hardly took his hand off my leg all the way through supper? - (laughs) Well, what's so strange about that? I could fancy a bit of that myself. - You make me sick the way you play up to him, laughing at everything he says like a hard up whore! - Well, at least he's got some charm. - He fancies you, he makes a play for you. You do nothing to discourage him! What must John think of me! - Oh, don't be stupid. - We should never have come here. Has he asked you to pose for him again? - Shut up. - Oh, don't mind me, I'm just your husband. - So, is that what you are? I thought you were a charity I've been supporting for years. - Don't worry, I'll pay you back. This deal. - This deal will be like every other deal. Why bother to pour it out? Why not just dive into the bottle? - Oh, I wouldn't need the booze if-- - If what? Come on, I'd like to know. - If I had a decent wife. - God, I like that. I feed you, clothe you, clean up your filthy mess. I've given you everything! - No, not everything. - Well, what? What haven't I given you? - Respect. - Respect? I'll respect you when you stop making me sick! (Mike panting) I'm going to stay with friends. Don't come looking for me (zipper clattering) until you learn to respect yourself. (latch clicking) (footsteps pattering) Oh, Victor. - I was worried. I thought you'd forgotten our appointment. - Well, actually, I... If you still want to paint me, I'm ready. (footsteps pattering) - I'm all ready to start. - Where do I sit? - Oh, first you have to change. - Change? - Well, surely. (laughs) You're teasing me. You're not shy, are you? You do want to pose for me. Oh. Try this one on. (wind howling) (bird warbling) (clock ticking rapidly) (paper rustling) (wind howling) (bird warbling) Oh, it's not right. There's no feeling. Perhaps if we try another pose. - No, Victor! - No, well gods then, what's the matter now? - Sorry, I can't. - Sorry, sorry, is that all you can say? - Please don't be angry. - Please don't be angry. What do you think you're doing to me? You can't turn me on and off like a damned switch! Oh, you make me sick! (wind howling) (door creaking) - Victor? Victor? (gloves rustling) (floor creaking) (wind howling) Is anyone there? (wind howling) (muffled screaming) (knife thudding) (muffled screaming) (Jane gasping) (body thudding) (body dragging) (latch clicking) (window sliding) (body thudding) (body sliding) (body thudding) (door creaking) (wind howling) (body dragging) (doors thudding) (latches clicking) (engine revving) (utensils clattering) - It's a fine morning. - Yes, it's lovely. - Are you sure you wouldn't like a little toast? - No, thank you. - It's not healthy, going without breakfast. - He's nice, isn't he? - He's been with Victor for something like 30 years. He used to help him when he did his own plaster. Sort of studio technician. - But don't you need lots of equipment for that? A forge and things? - He's got one. See that stone building over there? - Yes. - It used to be an old tin mine. Victor converted the furnace they used for smelting tin. He doesn't use it anymore. (door clicking) - Good morning, Michael. Isn't Jane up yet? - Don't ask me, I. (mutters) We had a terrible row last night. She went back to London. - In the middle of the night? - Yes, well, she's done it before. I remember when we were on holiday in Spain, she left. Didn't see her for three weeks. She's always doing it. And you don't blame her either. - I didn't hear her go. - Nor me. - I heard her drive away. It's a beautiful morning, I've been for a long walk. I trust that you, Mr. Davis, and the lovely Millie are gonna take full advantage of our good sea air. - Yes, we hope to later. - After we've talked business. Oh, Michael didn't give your little game away. You did. - I did? - By coming here. You're not one of Michael's friends, you're not the sort. Besides, I noticed there were one or two bits and pieces missing from my collection some weeks ago. I wondered what had happened to them. I suppose my son stole them and sold them to you. - I didn't steal them. - We won't go into that now. Oh, don't be embarrassed. I'm, of course, delighted to see you for whatever the reason, especially when you bring such a lovely companion. I suppose it would be too much to hope that she might be persuaded to pose for me. - Now, just a minute. Don't I have any say in this? - Well, of course you do, my dear. It's just our little joke. Mr. Davis, perhaps you'd like to come along to the studio and we can talk. - [John] Yes. (footsteps pattering) - Oh yes, do come too, Michael. After all, you'd better protect your business interests. - Victor, will you be needing me today? - Not until this afternoon. - I thought I'd go down to the beach. - Good idea. Now why not take Millie along with you. (both laughing) - 100 for this, 100 for this. And 150 for this. And I'd like some sculpture. - No doubt you would. Well, I'd say that's about 2000 pounds you've offered me. - It's a fair offer. - Is it, is it indeed? And how much profit will you make? - Oh, it's difficult to say. - And how much profit will my son make? 2000 pounds. Hmm, it's a lot of money. How much did you get for the stuff you stole, aye, Michael? Was robbing your father a profitable business? - Oh for God's sake. - Oh, what would you call it? - I'd call it taking what was owed to my mother. - She knew about it? - No, no, of course not. - [Victor] Oh, I'd thought not. - She hasn't the nerve to stand up to you. You've turned her mind with your bullying, your deceit. Yes, I robbed you, and I'm proud of it. It's the only decent thing I've ever done, and I'm proud of it! - And you did it for your mother? - For both of us. - Your mother. Let me show you your mother. This is how she was 30 years ago. And this is how I still see her. Look at her, isn't she desirable? Wouldn't any man want her? That mad, senile old hag isn't the woman that I knew! (Mike whimpering) (Marcia screaming) (women laughing) (waves crashing) (Marcia grunting) (women grunting) Well, there's no need to worry. I shan't go to the police about your little escapade. - Thank you. But it wasn't all one-sided, you know? - Oh? - No! Your work sold very well, it should do you a lot of good. - In what way? - To make your name known as an artist. - Why should I care about that? Do you think that's what I work for? - None of these people would be able to see your work. - People, what people? I don't work for people. I preserve the beauty of my models for myself and myself alone. That's what he could never understand. He wanted me to be rich and famous so that he could bask in my reflected glory. - You are mad. - And spend my money on his pleasures. - Mad as a hatter. - Shut up! - You know, it's just as well you do live down here because if you were in the real world, they'd lock you up. - Get out, you sniveling little swine! Get out and never come back! - I have a good mind to have you certified. And they would lock you up, and I could sell your paintings or maybe burn them all. - I'll kill you first! - For God's sake, Mike! - All right, I'm sorry. I'm sorry to have spoiled your little scheme. (footsteps pattering) - Well, I'm sorry that you should've had to witness that. - [John] That was probably my fault. I didn't realize all this would be stirred up when I came. Perhaps I'd better go. - Yes, perhaps you had. (women laughing) (waves crashing) Wait! About my work. It is just possible I might sell some. - Oh, that would be-- - But I should want cash, strictly cash. Those pictures you selected, how much did they come to? - About 2000. - You have the money on you? - Well, no, I thought I'd make you a cash down payment and let you have the rest later. - No, that won't do. I want cash, and I want it today. - But I can't raise that kind of money just like that. Besides, it's Sunday, the banks are shut. - Do you want the work? - Oh yes, of course. - You have until tonight. (footsteps pattering) - [Marcia] Mm, that feels good. - All right. - That's a lovely kimono. Where'd you get it? - In a market. - Market? - Yes, I collect Victorian things. I often go around to sales and markets. You can pick up things very cheaply. It's my hobby. You'd never believe it, that was a pound. - No. - Yes! - [Marcia] Here, now it's my turn. - If you like Victorian things, you should come to the boutique. - Boutique? - Yes, that's the business side, I've got a small boutique. I specialize in Victorian things. - I do hate the mark that your bikini leaves, don't you? I sometimes sunbathe with no clothes on, do you? How would you feel-- - No! I'd be too embarrassed. - But no one can see. - [Michael] Bad luck, darling! (laughs) (waves lapping) (seagulls cawing) (stones crashing) (Michael laughs) (stones crashing) (Michael laughing) (Michael squeals) (stones crashing) (Michael groaning) (waves crashing) (water splashing) (Michael groaning) (waves crashing) (Michael screaming) (water splashing) - You see, I have no choice. I can trust him, he will keep his word. - Not to be deferred, champ. I definitely wouldn't leave it too long. You'll be taking young Millie with you? - No, it's a bit of a long journey there and back. Anyway, she's out with Marcia somewhere. Why, do you think I should? - No, no. - She'll be all right. Anyway, she can keep the old man sweet. I think it was a bit of luck bringing her with me. Might even have strung the deal my way. - Well, she's a pretty girl. - Yep. Well, I should be back about 11. - I'll keep an eye on her for you. (engine revving) (tires rumbling) (waves lapping) (water splashing) (crow cawing) (water splashing) (Michael panting) (Michael chuckling) (waves crashing) (bottle rattling) (Michael whimpers) (stone smashing) (Michael groaning) (glass shattering) (seagulls cawing) (water lapping) - Such a pity that nice, young Mr. Davis had to go rushing off like that. - He said he'd be back as soon as possible. - And meanwhile he's left a most charming ambassador in his stead. - Not much of an ambassador, I'm afraid. I really don't know anything about art. - I'm sure that can't be so. - It is, it's absolutely true. In fact, I feel a bit like a fish out of water. Well, John's always taking me to exhibitions and things but. Well, somehow, I. I just know what I like. - You must let me teach you. - Well. - Come with me to my studio, come now. - Well, I said I'd help Bill with the washing up. - Marcia can do that. Besides, you really would be doing me a great favor. I do want to make a couple of sketches of you. - No, really, I'm no good at that sort of thing. I can't sit still for a minute. - Oh, a minute. - Really, I've got a terrible headache. I think I'll just go and lie down. - Joanna, listen. - [Joanna] No, I'm sorry. (phone receiver rattling) (car engines humming) (phone receiver rattling) (phone clicking) (phone ringing) - Hello? - Is Mr. Reynolds there? - [Reynolds] Oh, this is Jim Reynolds, who's that? - Hello, Mr. Reynolds, John Davis here. - [Reynolds] Who? - Davis, we met last year at the RA dinner. - [Reynolds] Did we? Oh yes, I remember. - I was wondering if you'd care to make a little investment. - [Reynolds] What sort of an investment? - I've discovered this marvelous new artist who-- - [Reynolds] No, thanks. - Well, wait, let me tell you. - [Reynolds] Sorry, Mr. Davids. - Davis. - [Reynolds] Well, I'm not interested in that sort of venture. I've got my fingers turned to-- - But look! - Sorry. (phone clicks) (John sighs) (phone receiver rattles) (horn honking) (hand knocking) - Who is it? - [Victor] I was just wondering how you're feeling. - It's still rather bad. - Pity, I thought that perhaps you might like a walk by the sea. It'll cure your head. - No, I think I'll just rest. - You're sure? (doorknob rattling) (latch clicking) - Yes, I'll just lie down. - Very well, my dear. I'll call back later and see how you are. - But Harry! (phone clicks) (John sighs) (phone receiver rattles) (cars humming) - Funny Jane leaving so suddenly last night, wasn't it? - Was it? - Up to your old tricks again? - Mind your own business. Anyway, you heard Michael, they had a row. - Yes, I heard him. I heard you on the stairs, as well. - All right. Always said your ears were a little out of proportion, a little too big. And your mouth. Lovely, but. Anyway, I'm no longer interested in Jane. - [Marcia] Found somebody new? Don't tell me, let me guess. Poor, Victor, playing hard to get, is she? - Oh, shut up. Her beauty fascinates me, so young and fresh. I want her and that's all there is to it. (dramatic music) (footsteps pattering) (door creaking) (Millie gasping) - Oh, I'm sorry. - Are you all right? - Yes. - You look upset. - No. - Come. How do you like my little collection? (door thudding) I was out East before the war. - Were you? - I made a bit of a study of their military history and ancient customs. You see this shield? It's over 300 years old. And that helmet is Tang Sin, Second century. At least I think it is. (dramatic music) It could be a good fake, I suppose. I say, are you all right? (door clicking) (door thudding) (footsteps pattering) - Joanna, I must talk to you. - I've told you, I've done all I can. You'll have to talk to George, and he's not back from Germany. - But it's a fantastic opportunity. - All right, driver. (horn honking) (doors thudding) (engine revving) - Joanna. - Yes, John. - We've always been real close. - Have we? - I thought so. I've always thought that in you I had a real friend. - How nice. - Our relationship has been more than just sponsor and beneficiary. - You mean, it wasn't just my money? - Oh, come on. I always think of you as a truly wonderful person, a real counselor of the arts. - That sounds very grand. I just thought you fancied me. - No. - You mean you don't fancy me? - Yes. Yes, of course, I. (sighs) Oh, please don't send me up, Joanna. - Well, don't try to con me. - I'm not, this really is a great deal. Look, this guy-- - Now you're boring me. Let's get back to the other subject. - What? - About your fancying me. (cars humming) (gentle instrumental music) (water lapping) (footsteps pattering) (gentle music) (suspenseful music) (footsteps pattering) (footsteps pattering) (water lapping) (suspenseful music) (footsteps pattering) (footsteps pattering) (water lapping) (footsteps pattering) (waves crashing) (footsteps pattering) (Millie panting) (wind howling) (waves crashing) (footsteps pattering) (wind howling) (waves crashing) - Are you there, Millie? I should come down, if I were you. Those caves lead to the old mill workings. They stretch for miles. If you once get lost in there, you'll never get out! Millie, Millie, don't be afraid! Millie, Millie, don't be afraid! (Millie panting) (shoes scuffing) (bats squeaking) (shoes scuffing) (Millie gasps) (water dripping) (sand crunching) (water dripping) (sand crunching) (water dripping) (dramatic music) Millie! Millie! Millie! Millie, Millie, Millie! (voice echoes) Millie, Millie! (voice echoes) Millie, Millie! (dramatic drumming music) Millie! (dramatic drumming music) (footsteps pattering) (body thudding) (footsteps pattering) (sand crunching) (match striking) (sand crunching) (footsteps pattering) (clock ticking softly) (door thudding) Yes? Yes? - I've... I've tried not to mind about the girls. - What girls? - All of them, the girls you've had here. - Girls? Oh, you mean my models? - I've tried not to mind. - Mind? An artist must have models. Surely even you understand that. Oh, you used to pose for me yourself. - No, I didn't. - [Victor] Yes, you did. - No, no! Marcia doesn't like me. - Dorothy, why are you here? - Here? - Here, in my studio. - About this girl. - What girl? - You mustn't. - Ah, do you mean Millie? - She's very young. - Not so young that she plays with dolls! - Don't shout, you'll make poor Jenny cry! - Oh, for God's sake, Dorothy. - She's going to cry! - It's a doll, a plastic doll! - Poor Jenny, never mind. - A doll, Dorothy, a doll! A cheap, ugly, rotten plastic doll! (flames roaring intermittently) (stoker rattling) - Oh, there you are! I wondered where you'd got to. - I got lost in the mine. - [Bill] Why did you go there? - It was Victor, he was chasing me. - Chasing you? - Yes, I went into the mine, and he followed me. - I think he doesn't want to see you get into any trouble. - Why have you started the forge? - He's asked me to start it up. Just like that, after all these years. Says he feels inspired. He must be. It'll be hours before the metal circle up. Mind the stack! It's full of sulfuric acid. We use it in the process. - What do you think of my little tour, my dear? Beautiful, isn't she? (flame bubbling) (flame hissing) (door clicking) I was worried about you in the mine. Several people have been killed there. And one or two lost forever. - Well, I'm all right. - So, I see. I was wondering if you've given any further thought to posing for me. - I don't really want to. - I've seen many beautiful women in my time, but few have had the illuminating loveliness that you possess. - You're very flattering. - That's a simple truth, my dear. A truth that I must capture in bronze. - Well. - Think about it. (Marcia laughs) (footsteps pattering) (footsteps pattering) (door thudding) - Millie! Tom Tom's come to say hello to you. Don't you want to say hello to Tom Tom? - Yes, of course. - I think he likes you. He bites people he doesn't like. Sometimes he bites Victor. - Don't you think we ought to be going downstairs? - He's lit the furnace, you know. I never go down to the forge, never. - Oh, I think it's very interesting. - You mustn't go there. Must she, Tom Tom? Tom Tom says you mustn't go there. My husband loved me once. - I'm sure. - He didn't just marry me for my money. Do you like my dress? - Oh yes, it's very pretty. - Do you like Bill? - Why? - I like Bill, he gives me things. Have you seen my things, they're very pretty. Victor likes pretty things, but he. Do you like Victor? - Well, I don't know. - If you do, you're the only one who does. Tom Tom bites him sometimes. - Yes, you said. - You must go away. You must go away now. - I can't. - Why not? - Well, for one thing, I haven't got a car. - Oh. Marcia wouldn't go either. - I shall be going soon, tomorrow. - Tom Tom bites Marcia sometimes. (laughs) She doesn't like it. Victor used to paint me once. He's lit the furnace. You? - I'm Millie. - I've bought a present for you, it's very nice. It's on the bed. (door clicking) (door thudding) (objects rattling) (suspenseful music) - What do you think of our little Millie? - She seems very nice. - Doesn't she remind you of anyone? - No, I don't think so. - Oh, surely you've noticed. - [Bill] No. - What about our Japanese friend? - Japanese? - Oh, don't be coy, Bill. Surely you've seen the likeness. - No, they seem quite different to me. - Do they? Well, perhaps they would to you. The resemblance I see is more than just a physical likeness. They both have the same magic, that's it. - I wonder what happened to her. - Yes, the little bitch. Do you know she really thought she was immortal? - Did she? Well, a very funny lot you know. - You can have it if you'd like. After all your years of devotion to her, I suppose you deserve something. - I don't understand why you wouldn't divorce her when I asked you. - Simple, I needed her money. And Bill, she didn't want you. Not then, not even now. (engine sputtering) (owl hooting) (door slamming) (owl hooting) (somber instrumental music) (dramatic music) To me, a beautiful woman is worth more than rubies. Her skin, her hair, her body are the earth, fire and air of creation. To look at her, to caress her. To possess her. This is all I ask of her. Did you know that Millie has agreed to pose for me? - No, no, Victor, I forbid it! - You? You forbid it? - (whispers) Yes. - You could forbid nothing, my dear. Do you think I care about you? I'm finished with you. You're old and ugly. Look at her! And to think I once desired this carrion. You forbid me. You really are mad. - Leave her alone! (phone ringing) Dunhaven, 357. John! Yes, do you want to talk to Millie? - Hello, darling, where are you? - Look, Millie, I've got the money but the car's parked in. I'm miles away. - You must get back. - [John] My dear, I can persuade Victor to wait. - No, for me. - [John] What's the matter? - Oh, darling, please come and get me, please. - What's the matter? Tell me. - It's Victor, he keeps on pestering me. Look, I can't explain now, but please come back. - Oh, stop exaggerating. Look, I've mortgaged myself up to the hilt for this deal. Don't you get in his way or he might change his mind. This is the biggest deal I've ever had. It means more to me than-- - Than I do? - Don't be silly. This is for both of us. - Look, I'm frightened. - [John] Just play along with him. - (sighs) Wait a moment. John's car has broken down. - Oh, where? - I don't know, you speak to him. - Hey, now, where are you? - [John] I'm just outside Bodmin. - Oh, that's not so bad. I'll get the van out and come and pick you up. - [John] It's only about 30 miles. - Yes, I could be there in an hour. - [John] I'll wait here. - Right. - Darling. - Now look, Millie, don't upset Victor. My whole future depends upon it. - I know but-- - Do you love me? - Yes, of course. - Then promise me you won't do anything to upset this deal. Right? - I promise. - [John] Good. (phone clicking) - Well, I'd better be going. I'll just get my coat. - Where are you going? - I'm going to fetch John, his car has broken down. - I don't want you to go. - I can't leave him stuck there-- - I'm frightened when you go. - You go to bed, I shan't be long. - I heard you and Victor talking. - Did you? - I can hear things in my room. Did you really want to marry me? - We'll talk about it later. I've got to go. - I think I'll go to my cave. - No, I told you! - I like my cave! - Better stay in the house. - In my cave, I saw. - Who, who did you see? - Someone. - Who? - It wasn't Michael, no. - I'd better be going. - You really wanted to marry me? (dramatic music) (footsteps pattering) (thrilling music) (mallet clanging) (dramatic music) (mallet clanging) (dramatic music) - Wait! Tonight, I'm a man inspired. After all these barren years, you have inspired me. It's the truth. You must let me capture your beauty. And preserve it forever. Look at the fire, watch it burn. No one can capture the beauty of the flame because such beauty demands total sacrifice. Even while it burns, it consumes its own heart. All great beauty, all great art, demands this ultimate sacrifice. It is the price of immortality. Let me immortalize you. You will pose for me, won't you? (flame hissing) (flame bubbling) - I heard you come up. I assume you want to work. - Correct, I do. - How do you want me? Should I take to take up this morning's pose? - No, go to bed. - What? Don't tell me. Well, you won't be needing me tonight then. - Or ever again. - What does that mean? - I thought that was quite plain. - You don't think you can get rid of me just like that, do you? - Why not, you were paid well enough. - Paid for posing, maybe, but that's not all I did. - Well, that was up to you. - Look, I'm not some little art school tart you pick up and throw away just when you feel like it. You've had other girls before, I haven't minded. It doesn't bother me if you just want to sleep with her. - You're beginning to sound as though you thought you had some say in the matter. - Don't think I haven't. - And what do you think you can do? Oh, get out before I lose my temper! - Just what has she got that I haven't? What's so special about her? - This girl has an inner radiance, such as I've only seen once before. Hers is a beauty of the soul, and its her soul I shall capture through my art. - Oh, very impressive. But don't think I'm just gonna sit back and take it because I'm not. - Oh! (flame hissing) - Millie, my love. Here, let me. I've been talking to Victor about you. You have definitely made a conquest. I hope that was your intention. - He just said he wants to do a few sketches. - Is that what he said? Nothing else? - No. Why? - Well, he was going on a great deal about your beauty. I must say I agree with him. Are you going to pose for him? - Well, I don't really want to, but what can I do? - He can be very persuasive. - He frightens me. But I expect I'm just being stupid. - I suppose he told you you inspired him. He tells 'em all that. Don't worry, we all fall for it. Even I did once. - How long have you been with him? - Long enough. - I've never posed for an artist before. Do you think this will be all right? - (laughs) You're so naive. Once he gets you in there, you don't think he'll give a damn about what you're wearing, do you? Don't forget, if things get a bit much, my door is always open. (door thudding) (footsteps pattering) (door thudding) (eerie instrumental music) (knuckles knocking) - Millie, are you ready? - I won't be long. (eerie instrumental music) (flame hissing) (flame bubbling) (cover sliding) (hand knocking) (door creaking) - So, you came after all. (liquid splashing) (Marcia screaming) (Marcia groaning) (thrilling music) (flame crackling) (horn honking) (engine humming) (pencil scratching) (eerie instrumental music) (metal scraping) (eerie instrumental music) (dramatic drumming music) (door rattling) (door rattling) - Millie, Millie! (dramatic drumming music) (Millie panting) (water dripping) (rat squeaking) (Millie gasping) (dramatic instrumental music) (water splashing) (dramatic instrumental music) (water splashing) (Millie screaming) (water splashing) (Millie whimpering) (Millie panting) (water dripping) (somber piano music) (rocking chair creaking) (knife clanging) (dramatic music) (rocking chair creaking) (Millie screaming) (dramatic instrumental music) - Ah, there you are. (car humming) (dramatic music) (furnace humming) (birds warbling) (furnace humming) (liquid splashing) (furnace humming) (tires rumbling) (flame hissing) (flame bubbling) - Millie? Millie! (flame hissing) (substance crackling) (doorknobs clicking) - Millie, Victor? (furnace humming) (flame hissing) (footsteps pattering) - There's nobody here. - Forge. (furnace humming) (flame blowing) (dramatic music) - Oh my God! (thrilling music) (Victor grunts) (chains rattling) (Victor shouting) (Victor screams) (body thuds) (Victor groans) (thrilling music) (Victor gasps) (torch hissing) (Victor grunts) (torch hissing) (thrilling music) (metal clanging) (torch hissing) (thrilling music) (metal clanging) (flame hissing) (metal clanging) (torch rattles) (dramatic drumming music) (Victor screams) (thrilling music) - Millie! What are you doing, Millie, no! - Don't, Chi-San! Don't do it! (Victor screams) (woman laughs) (Victor screams) (gurney rattles) I've finished with the police. You'll have to make a statement in the morning. - I just don't understand. Victor. The others, it's terrible. - One thing I learned out East, never underestimate the power of revenge. - You shouted something, what was it? Chi-San? What did that mean? - That was the name of a girl. Japanese. As soon as I came through that door and saw Millie in that kimono, I knew. - [John] But this Chi-San. - Oh, yes, Chi-San. Victor was obsessed by her, I don't know what happened. He was under her spell for years, then she just disappeared. All that was left was a bronze, his best work. (man choking) He said it was cursed, put it away. (man choking) This girl was part of a very sinister religious sect. (man choking) They believed the spirit of the dead could enter the mind of anyone who wore that kimono and use their body to take revenge. I read once that in extreme cases the body of the wearer actually took on a likeness of whoever was controlling their mind. (Michael screams) Once Millie had put it on, she was completely under Chi-San's control. (stone smashing) In a trance. (Marcia screams) Mike, Jane, the others. Millie didn't even realize what she had done. - [John] You mean that, that thing, that was Millie? - As I said, she had grown to resemble her controller. A tragedy had befallen her to make her so disfigured. I don't know. - But Millie just picked up the kimono in a market somewhere. She'd never even heard of Victor Clare. It's the most incredible chance. - Was it? The power of evil is always stronger than that of good. If you ask me, it was preordained. (thrilling orchestral music)
