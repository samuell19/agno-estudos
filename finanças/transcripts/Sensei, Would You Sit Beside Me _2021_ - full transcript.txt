I've finished. Good work! Sorry for the late completion. Not at all, you're quite fast, Sawako-sensei. (T/N: addresses teachers, artists etc.) I heard a certain Sensei often misses deadlines. I've finished too. Could you please check it? Thanks. Here's the final chapter of the series. - Thank you. I'll look it over. - All right. Here's your food. No, it's over here. The foreshadowing was beautifully resolved. A perfect final chapter! Thank you very much for your great work. It's thanks to your advice, Chika-san. (T/N: polite suffix to address people) Not at all. His background art is excellent too. - Stop it. - But it's true. - Right, Sawako-sensei? - Yes, it's a big help. Sorry to bring this up so quickly after you've finished, but I'd like you to start on a new story soon. What? Chika-san, let my wife rest for a while. For a certain Sensei, "a while" has become a period of five years. Four years, not five. Your fans are waiting. - Well, I am at least. - I'll think about it. A new story... Thank you! I'll take this with me. Take her to the train station. Huh? Is that all right? Thank you. - Bye. - Give my regards to the editor-in-chief. I will. Thank you very much. Excuse me. I'll be off now. I'm sorry for bothering you. I have nothing else to do. Don't say that! You need to get busy. Hello? This is Hayakawa. My mom had an accident? [Sensei, Would You Sit Beside Me?] - Hello! - We're here! Welcome. Thank you for coming such a long way. Long time no see. Are you all right? Yes, I'm completely fine. It's just a small fracture. You don't need to get up. Yes, please sit down. Thanks. I'm sorry for worrying you. It'll heal soon. I'm so glad it's just a slight injury. It must be awkward not being able to drive here. That's true. My room is still empty, right? You're really going to stay here? Yes, for the time being. I put the stuff you sent in your room. Oh, thanks. Sorry, we're imposing on you like this. And this guy, too. You're more than welcome. But I'm sorry she dragged you here as well. No, this is much more relaxing than home. Really? Thank you. But what about work? Oh, mangas can be drawn anywhere. This taro stew is delicious! It's just taro stew. Tell us you want us to buy anything for you. Sorry to trouble you. It's fine. Considering she grew up in a place where a car is essential, it's strange that she doesn't have a driver's license. You're going to take lessons? Yeah. Why didn't I get a license again? I told you to, but you said you didn't need one in Tokyo and would rather read mangas. Did I? Get one this time, okay? All right. Having a license will be useful in the future. So get one, all right? - Sorry to burden you. - Not at all. You must be busy with work. What? No, I'm... Toshio-san is a really great husband, right? Yeah. That's all you can say? He's your husband. It's brought Toshio-san here, so I'm glad I had an accident. I'm joking. Sorry, I wasn't listening. Doesn't Toshio-san have any bad points? He does. Really? So is he in fact hot-tempered? Do his feet stink? Is he adulterous? Adulterous? Hey! You're sure you want to be here? Isn't it inconvenient for you? I took a nice bath. Thank you. Wasn't too hot for you? No, it was just the right temperature. How long has it been since we slept in the same room? It's just for the sake of appearance. By the way, what did you tell her about me? Like what? About the mangas. I'm not drawing any. I said you're preparing your next one. I'll turn the light off. Hey. Hm? For the new story, how about an agricultural fantasy? But I still only have a vague idea about it. On the surface he's a farmer, but behind the scenes he's a magician. And it's a love story. Yeah, sounds good. Why don't you ask Chika-san about it? Yeah. - Good night. - Good night. Sorry I took so long. It's no good? She said I shouldn't do a fantasy story next. Chika-san's so stubborn. She wants something realistic. Realism? From you? I'll try calling her again. The battery's dead. Didn't you recharge it? I forgot. Can you lend me yours? Sure. No, I'll speak to her. Hello? Toshio-san? It's Sawako. What? Oh... Sawako-sensei! About what we were saying. Actually, I think that just farming and romance are too low-key. [Wakakusa Driving School] Hayakawa-san. - Hayakawa-san. - Yes. We're about to drive, but your mind's elsewhere. Sorry. Please take care of me. All right, let's begin with starting and stopping, okay? Please check your seat's position and fasten the seat belt. Let's try starting the engine. Good. First, check if it is safe to drive off. You're pressing the brake pedal? Check in front, behind, right and left. Once you know it's safe, release the emergency brake and put it in drive mode. Push the button. Good. All right. Now press the gas pedal gently. The gas pedal. Hayakawa-san? Take your foot off the brake and press the gas pedal. You need to press the gas pedal. Welcome home. I'll start preparing dinner. Sorry, I'm not hungry. What's the matter? It seems she couldn't drive. - She couldn't get in the car? - No, she couldn't... press the gas pedal. She says she has a driving phobia. Maybe it's stress. She's worried about her manga. Hayakawa-san? Sorry for the wait. Hashimoto-sensei is off today, so I'll be instructing you. The name's Shintani. Nice to meet you. I managed to drive today. Well done! I was afraid you'd never get a license. I need to learn to drive, don't I? If you left me, I couldn't get around. - What do you mean? - Can I put the radio on? We're back! Welcome home. - Let me get that. - Thank you. Sorry for making you cook yet again. I don't mind. Sorry, I'll eat later. Hey, wait, Sawako! [Driving school] [Driving phobia] [Sensei] - Morning. - Morning. Have you slept well? Yeah. It's good you're working, but you should act a bit more like a wife, too. You need to take better care of Toshio-san. You should say what's on your mind. Are you still angry? No, why? You're silent. Sorry, I was thinking about the draft. Oh, I see. Will you be able to draw it? Sorry, you don't have to talk if you don't want to. I drew a lot yesterday. Oh, really? You're doing the agricultural fantasy? No, I gave up on it. Really? I started over again. What's it about? Adultery, I think. A very different direction. Don't tell Chika-san about it yet. Okay. [Wakakusa Driving School] I have lessons all day, so pick me up at five. Thanks. Yes, Sakurada speaking. Hello? Toshio-san. Can I ask you something? What story are you having her draw? Why do you ask? She said she needs time to think. Yeah, that's right. Has she made any progress? I don't really know. She's being vague. Why are you calling me then? You're offering to spy on her for me? No, not this. Aren't you doing it already? Toshio-san. I miss you. - Look─ - I'll check in on her soon. - Then we can─ - You don't have to come here. What? She's busy with driving lessons. Yeah, but... I'll call you later. All right, I'll wait for it. "Chapter One. The final chapter of a long series. I'm a little sad it's over, but also euphoric. Looking back, I was really happy for those few minutes." Good work, Sensei. I'll take this with me. Sure. Take her to the train station. Huh? Is that all right? Thank you. My pleasure. What is this? Give my regards to the editor-in-chief. I'm sorry for bothering you. I have nothing else to do. What? My mom had an accident? I will soon find out. Something I pretended not to notice. But I've seen it with my own eyes now. [Wakakusa Driving School] I'm back. I'm sorry. What for? I was late. It's fine. I'm sorry for always making you drive. No problem. - It's her fault. - No, I'm the one to blame. Oh, sorry. What are you talking about? You've had a fight, right? Pick me up around five again, okay? Do you have lessons all day again? I'm starting to enjoy it. Bye. It's unusual for her to enjoy something. Does she wears skirts? Only very occasionally. She's wearing one today. Is she? Even though she's driving. Yeah, it's certainly strange. Chapter Two. Living in the countryside. After being nagged to get a license, I took a driving lesson. However... You need to press the gas pedal. For some reason, I couldn't press the gas pedal. Today is my second lesson. Hello. Sorry for the wait. Hashimoto-sensei is off today, so I'll be instructing you. The name's Shintani. Thank you. Nice to meet you. Yes, it's nice to meet you. This way, please. Look. I think I may have... a driving phobia. But I... really need to get a driver's license. There's no need to rush. Let's get used to the course first. I'll drive, so let's switch seats. Are you from here? No, from Kamigahira. So far away? Did someone drive you here? Yes, my husband. That's kind of him. Is there some reason you really need to get a license? Sorry, I shouldn't be so intrusive. I might be alone in the future. Sorry to put that on you! Please forget what I said. Well, if that happens, and you still can't drive, I'll drive for you. Even if you can't drive yourself, you'll feel better knowing someone will drive for you. Let's switch seats. First, check it's safe to drive off. Then release the emergency brake and switch in drive mode. Now, try gently releasing the brake. It feels good, you know? Speeding along in a car feels really great. Don't worry. If there's any danger, I'll protect you. Okay. Take a deep breath. Remove your foot from the brake, and gently press the gas pedal. Sensei! We're moving! That's fine. Continue like this for a while. I can't take it! You have a gas pedal as well? Hold the wheel firmly. This feels great! [This feels great!] You managed to drive. - Thank you! - You're welcome. Thanks to you, I've taken my first step. It was you who did it. No. It's weird, but with you sitting beside me, I can press the gas pedal. You make me feel safe somehow. I managed to drive today. - Well done! - Yes. I was afraid you'd never get a license. I guess my husband is planning to dump me once I get a license. No, no! "Sensei, would you sit beside me?" [Driving School] What am I thinking? It's just a manga! It's fiction, a made-up story. It isn't real. It's a manga. Not real. There's no reason for me to worry. Oh, you're here! You always take lessons... from the same Sensei? Yeah. Are they a good Sensei? Yeah, it's a kind person. A man? A young one? Why do you ask? Just curious. That's unusual. What is? Recently, you haven't been curious about me at all. That isn't true. It's been like that. You're working tonight as well? Welcome. This, please. Do you best. [Chapter Three] Please pull over there. Um... all right. Take it slowly. Did I do something wrong? No, nothing like that. Has something happened? "Something"? Something you don't like. You look depressed. Oh... Here. Oh. Excuse me. You were driving faster than usual. It was strange, so... I thought something was wrong. When you're anxious, it's good to stop the car and refresh yourself. Put some distance between you and your troubles. That's what I do as well. I'm sorry. It's fine. - Let's get some fresh air. - I want to stay here! Sorry. I feel... that I can relax best when I'm with you, Sensei. - Do you want some peaches...? - See you later! [Certified Wakakusa Driving School] [For people over 70: Training for senior citizens - Now accepting reservations] [For people over 70: Training for senior citizens - Now accepting reservations] You have a good feel for it. Really? Do you have lessons tomorrow? Huh? Yes. Why don't you take a rest? You're working every evening. Isn't it too much? I'm fine. I like taking lessons. Even if you don't get a license... What do you mean? You're the one who suggested lessons. But not for that reason. What reason? What I mean is... The draft on your desk... You read it? Sorry. How is it? "How is it?" Is it a true story? It's you, isn't it? With the driving instructor. Right? What if it is? You won't forgive me? What? Well... So you're having an affair? What? If it's a true story. Do you? Toshio-kun? No. (T/N: suffix used mainly for men) I don't. Right. You shouldn't have read it. What am I doing? [Sensei, Would You Sit Beside Me?] Won't you... continue the manga? Do you want know what happens? I'm thinking of giving it up. What? So you don't have to tell Chika-san. Sorry. I shouldn't have read it. You think that's why? It isn't that, you know? What about your manga? Are you drawing it? No. I have no intention to. - Why? - You know why. I can't draw. Yes, you can. Nothing I see... moves my heart. - Morning. - Good morning. Sorry, I overslept. This is... Morning. Morning. I'll make coffee. Oh, all right. Good morning. Turnip and mushrooms for the salad. Salad. And... - Curry, right? - Curry? Those soba noodles look delicious. Yeah, but we're having curry today. May Queen potatoes? But... Let's eat. They're sweet. Delicious. But a bit too big! Well done. Yeah, I'm so happy. [Driver's License] Congratulations. [A beautiful bridge curving over cobalt blue waters] Toshio-kun. I want to go for a drive. Can I borrow the car? It's too dangerous on your own. I'll go with you. I'm not going far, so it's fine. And anyway, I got full marks on my test. All right. Drive safely. Thanks. Sawako. Don't stay away too long. If she had an accident, the police would call us. Yeah, that's what happened in my case. Yeah. She hasn't run away, has she? Do you think she's abandoned us? Hello? This morning, Sawa-chan took the car and hasn't come back. (T/N: suffix used to address cute people) What? Has she called you? No. I hope she didn't have an accident. I guess... she didn't. You had a fight? - About us? - No. To be honest, I've read the draft. What? Draft? Sawako-sensei's? She's made progress? The problem is the subject. What's it about? Adultery. A story about adultery. Depicting reality! I think she probably knows about us. And she's having an affair too... Probably. Hello? Hello? Hello? You have received a fax. [Chapter Four] I knew it. "Sensei. I've taken the wrong road. Do you want to go back?" Maybe... - "I can't go back anymore." - I can't go back anymore. Sensei. Before, you said... you'd drive for me if I ended up alone. I was glad to hear that, even if you were joking. No. I wasn't joking. Long time no see! The air is good here! Excuse me. Who are you? Hello. Sorry to suddenly turn up like this. I revise Sawako-sensei's mangas. The name's Sakurada. Oh, nice to meet you. I'm Sawako's mother. Nice to meet you. Has your injury healed? Yes, completely. I am sorry. It is inconvenient that she is currently here, right? Oh, that's not a problem. I'm just worried because I heard she's disappeared. I'm very sorry for the trouble. Don't apologize. I hope she's all right─ She's fine! You've heard from her? Yes, a fax just arrived from her. A fax? What does it say? She sent.. Her manga. She's so unpredictable. Please let me read it. This is great! Good enough for a series. So real and fun! It's too real! But the kiss scene needs a frame of their hands entwined. After this one. She's dumped you before you could do it! No, no! I haven't the slightest intention of dumping her. And anyway, I-I-I... I'm still not sure... if she's cheating on me. Why are you trying to fool yourself like this? Chika-san, do you eat peaches? Yes, I do! Chika-san! That... There you are. This taro stew is delicious! Really? Sorry, it's all leftovers. No, no, I'm really grateful. I'm so relieved that Sawako-sensei seems to be fine. What on earth is she thinking? Can't she draw here? - May I come in? - Sure. This is from her mom. Thanks. Why are you doing this? - I didn't intend to stay─ - Not that. A series? Are you serious? But it's such a good story. It's a bother if everyone knows about it! Is that your reply, Toshio-san? "Reply"? That manga... is a message from Sawako-sensei to you. Wanting to hide our affair─ Not so loud! It means you're admitting that we're having an affair. That's your reply to her? No. So isn't it better to publish and pretend it is fiction? As long as we can hide it, there'll be no problem. But... You're so mean. Hey, stop! Don't! Good night. [From Chika: The next chapter's arrived!] Are you sure... you don't have to go back? Do you want me to? I don't want you to. Then... I won't. I want to... get revenge on my husband. Shintani-sensei, we can't just elope. I'd hate it if it were only like this... He cheats on me, so I cheat on him. That would be... Sawako-san. I asked him if he was cheating on me. But he denied it. If he'd admitted it then, maybe I'd have forgiven him. But... he didn't even give me the opportunity. She really asked you? Of course, you denied it. Shintani-sensei, I guess I've been using you. I'm sorry. I don't mind being used. Sensei. I love you. Let's go to your place tomorrow. I can't wait to see my husband's face. If this really happened, it would be amazing. What? Things just got interesting! Sawako-sensei! I heard you'd suddenly disappeared, so I came. Sorry for worrying you. So you've been here? I've read your draft. It's brilliant! Really? That's great. Hello. Hello. Where have you been? Well... It's hot out here. Why don't you come inside? Yes. Hello, I'm... Sawako-san! To be continued in real life, right? Thank you very much. Thank you. And you are? Sorry to turn up without notice. My name's Shintani. I'm an instructor at Hayakawa-san's driving school. She kindly invited me to have dinner here. Thank you. Huh? That's all? What do you mean by that? Sawako-sensei. What's your intention? I... have some work to do. Right now? This is... Look. Shintani... Sensei. Yes? Why? Why have you... really come here? Huh? I'll carry this. Thank you so much, Chika-san. Sawako won't give me a hand. No, it's fun. I feel like I'm at my mom's house. Here you are. Thank you. Let's just start eating without her. Please help yourself. Thank you. Bon appétit. With a handsome Sensei like you, it's no wonder she put you in the manga. You flatter me. But she's a great mangaka, isn't she? Such a vivid imagination. I was so surprised. Sorry about all this. No, I'm sorry for causing confusion. I've never seen her outside of lessons. There's really nothing going on between us. What a relief. So where's she been these past couple of days? I have no idea. Of course. You're a mangaka too? Yes, a very famous one─ No, not at all. At first, she didn't like driving, but she was determined to work hard for your sake. She said she relies on you too much, both for manga and housework, so the least she could do was learn to drive. She said that? She never told you? She's always been difficult like this. Sawa-chan. Let's talk a bit. I love your wife. Hey, let's talk a bit. Talk about what? I'm not having an affair with her. It's all just your imagination. No. [I'm not having an affair with her.] [It's all just your imagination.] Talk about what? Me and Chika-san, we're... [Me and Chika-san, we're having...] Oh? Sawa-chan. Let me... write it. Please. [Me and Chika, we're...] [having an affair.] I'm not asking you to forgive me. I wanted to tell you. I know you don't believe me, but I had no intention of dumping you. I wanted to... make a fresh start. Then why? When I asked if you were having an affair, why did you deny it? I'm sorry. It's already too late. I know. But... Sawa-chan, I love you. What? It's already too late. Way too late. Toshio-kun. I hate you. Hate you. [I hate you.] [Hate you.] This won't get approved. You should redraw it. I'll go back to Tokyo. I think that's best. So I have to draw it alone? Sensei. Toshio-sensei. Would you sit beside me? Um... Could you ink this draft for me? Why me? Why? Because you're my Sensei. That was years ago. If I draw it, it'll be a different manga. I know, that's fine. I want you to complete the art. You're my only Sensei. Fine then. - Try the pickles. They're delicious. - All right, thank you. - Help yourself. - Thanks. They've been up there for a while. I hope they're all right. Do you want to check? Let's not do this. What? Sensei... Sensei is... - Are they okay? - Don't! What are they doing? They're... drawing a manga together! Your affair with Shintani-sensei is... fiction. Right? Yes. You fooled me. That was my intention. I was also thinking of not returning. Were you jealous when I brought him? Did it move your heart? Well, yeah. I see. I'm glad I came back then. My revenge is complete. Let's take the car... to the sea. I'll think about it. Please check this. Thanks to our Channel Manager madameazul20 Chief Segmenter: kitty100 Chief Editor: xylune Thank you for watching this movie!
