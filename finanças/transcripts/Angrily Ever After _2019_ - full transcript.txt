- So, today, I give you a sneak peak where my nuptials will take place. Oh my goodness. For those who've been following my wedding story, you know I met my man, Malcolm Wright, last year and he wooed me with wine, trips and this rock! I'm so lucky. I always wanted a guy like Malcolm. I wish my Dad would have been here to meet him. I know he would loved Malcolm because Malcolm is a good provider and that was important to my Dad. As a matter of fact, my Dad used to work security here and he always talked about how beautiful the weddings were. I hate my Daddy can't walk me down the aisle, but I know he'll be watching me from Heaven. OK, are you guys ready to do this? Let's do this. Isn't it beautiful in here?! # 8daysleft, #MrandMrs, #LoveMeSomeHim, #HappilyEverAfter. - Ms. Logan, welcome back! We're getting close to the date. - Yes, I know, eight days to be exact. - Have all 200 guests confirmed? - Absolutely. Malcolm's family owns the most prestigious black law firm in DC. I have people that I don't even know DMing me to attend! - I bet! - My final payment. - Congratulations! You will be saying, "I do," in one of the most beautiful venues in the city. - It's happening! - Tia, how are you this morning? - I'm wonderful, Bruce. It is a beautiful Fridaymorning and love is in the air. - There's not much love out there on inbound 295. Traffic is really slow because everybody's merging into one lane because of all the work that's going on. - Hmm, if you're heading in that direction, allow for additional driving time for your morning commute. Here's Michelle for more traffic details. Too many times, hey Tracy! - Good morning! TJ set up a morning meeting. - Oh girl, you look good! - So do you! - Surprise! - Oh my goodness. - To the bride to be, this is just a little something from all of us at WBX. Congratulations, girl! - Awe, ya know what, truthfully, I have you to thank! Had you not let me do that interview with Malcolm, I might've ended up a miserable, lonely soul. Shelby, join the party! - Oh, how sweet. Too bad, I actually have work to do. - Well, from all of us, we still say congratulations and we just hope and pray you have a beautiful union. Congratulations again, girl. - And girl, thanks for giving us all hope. - Oh, see that? Mm, excuse me ladies. My man is calling. Hey babe! - Babe, I need you. - Awe, I need you too. - No, no, I need you here for brunch. - Right now? - I'm meeting with Fred Strota and his wife. I just need you here to entertain her while I close this deal. It could be a big client for us. - Well babe, I'm kind of in the middle of this party. - Babe, I know, I don't wanna pull you away, OK, but he owns over 50 stores and airports across the country. He's old school. They've been married for 40 years and his wife, Sarina, is a fan of yours, so please, I know if you're here, this deal is done. - Well, I am off air and it is Friday. I guess I can come. - You are my lifesaver. I love you. - I love you too. - I'll text you the address. - Your fiance is really determined. I've never seen anyone go after my husband's business with such tenacity. - Yes, he's very persistent. - Well, when I see something I want, I go after it, ma'am. - I imagine that's how he snagged you. - Yes ma'am, it is. - You two remind me of us. - Ah, if we could only be so lucky. - Can I get you something to drink? - Yes, I'd like to have a glass of Pinot Grigio. - Oh, you need to try their cabernet. - I don't really want red, babe. - You'll love it. Bring her a glass of the Opus One Cabernet. Trust me. So, Mr. Strota, I know that you're close to acquiring 50 fast food chains and we've done seven similar deals in the last four years. Four more than any other firm you're considering. - You have all the right things to say, don't you? - Especially when it comes to securing what I deserve. Bottom line, we're the best team for the job. - You know, this was supposed to be an informal brunch, which is why I brought Sarina along to begin with. - Don't believe that. He can't make any decisions without me. - She is right about that. But I can say that, I am very impressed. I will be speaking with my partner about having Wright, Moore, and Wright handling our legal affairs going forward. - Sounds good. Well? I told you. Perfection. - Jillian look, TJ threw me a bridal shower at the office, look! - Oh, so kind. - Look, look, look! It's so nice. - Wait, wait. What is this face, Tia? - Shelby happened. - I'm gon' have to make a meme of this. This is the face you make when a guy tell you, "I got that good Polish sausage," but he show up with a vienna sausage. - The disappointment. - Excuse me, can you tell me where I could find... - Oh I'm sorry, I don't work here. I don't work here. - Okay. - Why the heck, why they keep thinkin' I work here? Do I look like a librarian or something? - Well, you are shuffling aroundyour client's books again. So disruptive! - I am a publicist. Prominent bookshelf space is everything. You know that. - When are you going to start your own publishing company? - Uh, whenever you have a bestseller. I mean, how great would it be to have your book splashed on every bookshelf, The Joy Of Having It All by my girl, Tia Logan. - I can't wait! - Uh, neither can the publisher. So, what's taking you so long with the next draft? - Between planning the wedding and Malcolm's social calendar, I'm busy! - Oh, you're stepping into your role as a Steffard. I mean, trophy wife. - My man sees me as his equal. - Sure, he does. So what's up with the wedding? - Well, I have my dress fitting tomorrow and I made my final payment on the venue yesterday, so nothing. Don't start, Jillian. - What?! - Don't! - I didn't say nothin'! - Yes, I, don't start Jillian. Non-verbal, stop it. I already told you, Malcolm is buying us a vacation property and paying for the honeymoon. I wanna contribute. Who wants to be one of those women who has to depend on their man for everything? - Not everything, just this expensive ass wedding. You shouldn't have to be paying for nothing. - Whatever Jillie, let's go. - Yeah? - Yeah. - After I get this book. - Really? - What? You just said who wants to be one of those women who have to rely on her man for everything. I don't need him if I got these. I know 'cause I'm a strong black woman. - Yeah, strong, real strong. Wow, this is nice and unexpected. - Just a little something special to say thank you. I couldn't have pulled off brunch without you. - Awe babe, you did all the work. I just say there and looked fabulous. - Well you must've did something right 'cause right after you left, she asked me for your email. Said she wants to invite you to speak at some Essence Women's Business Luncheon. - Really? - Babe, how many times do I have to tell you? We make a great team. Mr. Stroto called this afternoon and they want us to start negotiations. - I am so proud of you, baby. - For us. - Mmm, babe, these strawberries are delicious. Thank you. - You're welcome. I hand dipped them myself just for you. Oh, there's one more thing. I'll be right back. - He didn't hand dip nothin'. He bought... - Close your eyes and hold out your hands. Open em. - Oh. - Something blue. It was my grandmother's and now, she wants you to have it. - Oh baby, it's so beautiful. Oh, I am the luckiest woman in the whole world. - Yeah, I can't argue with that. - Excuse me, do you have any crackers? The bride wouldn't let us eat before the fitting and I'm starving! - The bride can't be bloated! - Oh, you look stunning! The queen approves. Listen, did Malcolm ever tell you where you're going for the honeymoon? - Nope. - Child, I don't know how you do it. I got to know where I'm going in advance. I just can't be going no anywhere with anybody. - It's called trust, control freak. It's OK to let the man lead. Sometimes, I like to follow. - Excuse me, ma'am, can you untighten that? That shit is way too tight. She's losing her mind, she's just saying anything. Going no anywhere. Tia, you look so beautiful. - What? Tia! What Tia? What Tia?! - Malcolm! What are you doin' with her? - Tia, wait, wait, wait, baby. - What are you doin' with her? - OK! - She's your ex! - Baby, calm down. Stop recording! - I trusted you! The wedding is off! - What do you mean? - Malcolm, you need to handle all this. - Look, this... - Bitch, what? Move, Malcolm. - Wait, Tia baby, chill, chill. - Cocky, no one fault son of a bitch! How could he do this to me? - Well, I hate to tell ya baby but, a man who lies about dipping his strawberries will lie about where he's dipping his banana with his dumb ass. Oh, you might wanna see this. - What, my bleak future? - Uh, something like that. - God. Oh my God. It's everywhere. - In today's evening news... - YouTube, the Gossip Room? Today's popular stories?! - And... - We're seeing her like we've never seen her before. - This is not what you think it is! - The wedding is off! The wedding is off! - Baby wait. - Malcolm, you need to handle all this. - Shut up. Bitch, what?! - Can you say #AngryBlackWoman? - Oh my God. - We need to go over these policies just to make sure that our client isn't at fault. Malcolm. Malcolm! Policies, client. - I know, I know. I'm sorry you had to come over here tonight, Rayna. I can't go back into the office tomorrow. I mean, my phone is already blowin' up. - There have been some text messages about you. - What are they saying? Nevermind. - Why do men propose if they're not even ready? - Wait, wait, wait. Didn't you say you were just in the office talkin' 'bout how you were breakin' up with David 'cause he hadn't proposed yet? - That's different. - No, no, no, no, exactly. Damned if you do, damned if you don't. Let's just get back to work. - I was grabbing the mail earlier like you asked and I found this in the uh... - How many of those have you eaten? Really, Tia? - Everyone's laughing at me. - Look, pull yourself together, friend! You know, I'm startin' to worry about you. You lookin' all sloppy! You gotta go back to work glowin'. I don't want you lookin' like this! - Oh no, no, no, no, no, no. I have to call out, I can't go in there. - Why not?! You dumped him and then you whooped his ass with a bouquet of calla lilies. In this case scenario, you the badass. - If anything, they laughing at him, not you! - Are you sure? - You damn right I'm sure. Now get your cake pop, fire startin' ass off my couch, take a shower, and then march back to work tomorrow like gettin' rid of Malcolm was the best thing that ever happened to you. - Yeah. Yeah, you right. - Damn right, I'm right. Yeah, I'm right. - Thank you, thank you. - Oh, yeah, yeah, get it together! You got this, girl! You good! You beautiful! This shit ain't gonna end well. - I'm going to strangle hislying ass and kick him in the... Can everyone clear the room please? We need to talk. - WBX employees shall not commit any act or do anything which might tend to bring the employee into public disrepute, contempt, scandal, or ridicule, or which might tend to reflect unfavorably on the network. Any sponsor of the program or any sub-sponsors advertising agency. - So can they suspend me? - I'm no lawyer, but I would say yes. - I gave up my place when I got engaged. Now because of Malcolm, I'm losing my home, my dignity and my job. - You can get another job. You can get another apartment. Dignity, child, it's overrated. Good thing you left Malcolm before the wedding! - Just... I don't know, I just thought everything was perfect! I feel so stupid! I feel... - Don't, don't! You're good! It's not as bad as it seem! Look, the internet will soon forget about you. Your heart will heal soon, I promise! I'll start canceling some of the wedding stuff. - The venue. - You will absolutely love this venue. Take a look at our pamphlet and if you have any questions, let me know. My name is Katie. - Thank you. - Thank you! Ms. Logan, what brings you by? - The wedding is off. - Oh, let's just say postponed. We don't like the word off. What happened? This is you? I am so sorry. You OK? - I will be once I get my refund. - Man, you really let him have it. - Excuse me, Katie. Katie, dear! I need my refund. - Oh, we don't like the word refund. - Well then, what word would you like? I need my money? Please. - OK, don't go all angry black woman, angry African Amer... Angry woman of col... Don't be upset. Let's just push the date back a bit just in case things change. But then your date will have to be within the next 12 months or your payment in full will be forfeited. - Are you saying I can't get my money back? - Cancellations and refundsmust be made 30 days in advance. It's in your contract. I am sorry. - That's $50,000, Katie. Gone. - We don't like the word gone. Let's just say it was an expensive lesson in love. Yeah! - Oh shit. God. What's up, world? I know I haven't done a follow up video to my wedding story since well, you know. My last post was four days ago right here in this very spot and I was full of joy, walking on clouds. Now today, I stand in the same spot but now the clouds are gone and so is my refund. Same spot, different place. #Isntltlronic, #LoveDontLiveHere, #WheresMyRefund, #AngrilyEverAfter. Damn that was a bad, that was a bad idea. Hmm. So, guess what happened today, guys. My book got shelved indefinitely. Their reason, my book title no longer works. I mean, think about it. How can I talk about the joys of having it all when I have nothing. Hey! Oh my gosh, there are way more of you following me than when I was talking about my wedding stories. Shut it, I heard that. No, PreacherMan32, I do not need prayer. No, you can not lay hand, can you... Nobody was talkin' to you. Do you always open your mouth this wide? Is it me or does misery love company? I said shut it! - Have you gone to counseling together? It's been three weeks. Tia, how many times have I told you, you do not throw the baby out with the bath water. Tia, how come I don't see your face anymore? Where are you? - I'm here, I'm here Mom, I'm here, I'm here. - There you go, OK. - I'm here. - I'm talking to you. Now, I am very sorry. P.S. I talked to him and I believe him. He apologized. Now your Dad, he worked two jobs Tia, for you to have a really good life and he only wanted you to be able to have some stability and have a good man take care of you and Malcolm is that. - Mom, I do not need a man to take care of me. - Yes, you do. - Mom, I will get another job. Mom, no! Dad taught me that too, ya know? I don't need a man to take care of me. - You're getting older. How are you gonna have kids? What man is gonna want you if you keep getting older? Malcolm is there, he's ready for you. So be with him. Are you tryin' to kill me? - Mom, calm down. Is it past your zanny time? - I don't know, I might need a zanny. You know what, I do. I'm gonna come over there. - No, no, no, no! No, no, no, I love you Mom. I gotta call you back. I thought I told you to throw that stuff away! - Girl, what is this, silk chiffon, this feels so good and no ya didn't. You said you didn't want it. It's a difference. Now, if Malcolm is foolish enough to buy it, I'm smart enough to wear it. And I heard what your Mama said. - I just need to find another really good job, something she can celebrate so she can tell her friends about it and she'll get off my back. Problem is, no one will hire me. - You just need to apply forjobs that don't have the titles news anchor or reporter in it. - But that's what I do, Jillie. - Baby, you have a whole Masters in Journalism. You could do whatever you want! Mm, that's probably a matching bracelet for my, our earrings. Uh, hello. You're not the delivery boy. - No, uh, I'm Van Joyner. Is Tia Logan in? We went to grad school togetherand I wanna talk to her about an opportunity. - Oh come in, come on in. Tia, it's a man here. - There she is, look at that. In the flesh, huh? How you doin' darlin'? - Oh my gosh! Hey! - It's been a long time. - I haven't seen you since Northwestern! Sit down, what are you... - Yeah, yeah. - What are you doin' here? - Well, it's funny that you ask. I actually work in television now. - Really? - Yeah. My colleague mentioned that you applied for a news reporter job with our sister station. Your address is on your resume. - Oh. - I want you to come on as one of the hosts for The Gossip Room. - Yes, yes, say yes! - I mean, I hope you were excited as your friend is. Have you see the show? - Yeah, I think like once or twice. It's two kids sittin' around a desk just talking. - Yeah, they're adults, not kids, yeah. - Yeah well, they act like kids. - Actually, it's a daily half hour news entertainment program averaging 3.2 million viewers weekly. The show is ranked number four in adults 18 through 34. We rank number two in women 18 through 34. We're syndicated in New York, Phoenix, Austin, and seven other cities. - Well, what's your affiliation? - I'm the Executive Producer. - What?! Oh my God, Van?! I'm impressed! - Hey, I'm the one that's impressed. I've been following your career. Always knew you'd do some great things. - Van Joyner, this is a really nice surprise. - Yeah, same here. Our goal here is not always to shock and entertain. We also like to educate. - Who are you educating when you poke fun at overweight celebrities and expose affairs? - Look, I don't always agree with everything you do, but my first goal is to keep the show on the air. My second goal is to expand into other shows on the air. Let me show you to your office. Right here. Well, I'm gonna let you get settled in. I hope you're ready. We're gonna go live tomorrow morning. - But I don't have any emails to give any advice on. - A few ladies emailed in once the post went viral. We'll use one of those. Soon as the show airs, it'll start pouring in. - Thank you again for this opportunity. - Don't mention it. I'm gonna have some guys come in here and straighten things up for you, OK? - OK. - Let me know if you need anything. - I will, thank you Van. - Yeah, no problem. - Oh yo, slow down. What's goin' on, how you been? Bring it in. - Hi, I'm Tia. - OK cool, we know who you are. We all know who you are. You still angry? - No, I'm fine, and you are? - I'm Austin B. - Oh yeah, you look familiar. - Yeah, I'm the host. Now, Brianna's the co-host and sister, you are the co-co-host. - OK, do you have a specialty or a segment? - Yeah of course. I do all the music, the beeps, all the albums and everything like that. Ain't nobody smashing this industry unless I know about it first. - OK, it was nice to meet you Austin. - Yeah of course but hang on a second now. Van got you doin' the girl's advice, correct? - Yes. - Try not to make us men look bad. - It's not my intent. - OK, but I'm just sayin', you sisters always got something negative to say about us brothers. - It's only when you deserve it. - Why don't you just report on one good brother a week, just one, but it gives sisters hope and it lets em know there's still brothers likewalking around every single day. - OK Austin, I'm just getting my ideas together but I promise you I'll keep that in mind. See ya later. - Of course, all right, Tia? See you on set! - Oh, hello, hello, hello, hello. - Damn, what took you so long? - Errr, 'scuse me, hi. I'm Brianna. I didn't get to meet you yesterday. - Tia! - All right come on, get focused. We're about to go live, let's go. - Can we get some more light in here? - In five, four, three, two... - Your mama. Yo, what's goin' on? Welcome to The Gossip Room. Now, a lot of crazy things took place yesterday. A lot went down but don't even trip. You know we got you. Before we get started, we have a new addition to The Gossip Room, Ms. Tia Logan. - Thank you, Austin. Brianna, I'm so happy to be here with you. We're live, America! - Yeah uh, you might've recognized her for the crazy viral video a couple weeks ago. - Or you may have known her from the morning news. Either way, she hangin' with us now. - She one of the best in the business. - Yeah! - Tia, let's not work those spec because I know it's about to be lit, lit. - All right Rihanna. This segment of the show iscalled Ask The #AngryBlackWoman. Oh. - Hey, hey, get it, get it. - Um... Uh OK um, today's letter comes from Paula and boy, it's a doozy. Paula and her man ended things and now, she's suing him for back pay of labor. - Back pay for sex? - No, for cooking and cleaning. - Hell yeah, that's what I'm talkin' about. - Well, my advice would be to really think about this lawsuit, Paula. What if he comes back and sues you for his labor? Maybe he washed your car, cut your grass. This could go back and forth in court until you owe thousands of dollars in court fees. I say cut your losses and give Darnell his dog back. - She took his dog? - Yes, a K-9 was apprehended but I assure you that no animals were harmed. I'm Tia Logan and that's my time. - Man, hell no! - She's just warming up. - No, it is called Angry Black Woman. Not stick up my ass woman. Come on, man! - And now you being so angry, right? I ain't yellin' in the hall. Brother, it's all good. She'll get into it. She'll get into it, I promise you. - All right man. - I need you, Austin. You're my go to brother, my A1 baby. - I'm A1. - Yeah, you the A1. You know dat. - Yeah! - OK. - Loosen up a bit. Yeah you know, like on set, we flow, ya know like a rap side for Lennon, flow you know? What is that, a boat neck? Girl, you gotta let the cleavage, you gotta let the girls show a little bit. Let em loose, let em hurt below. - Can I talk to you for a minute? - Yeah, I'm gon' talk to you tomorrow. Remember what I said. Let it flow, let it flow. - Thank you. - OK, y'all gettin' acquainted. - Yeah, it was a disaster, I know. - Not quite a tsunami but a 2.1 on the Richter scale. - Tomorrow, I'm on it, I promise. It's a new format for me. - Just be yourself! Let your natural charm and professionalism shine through! You good. - Got it, you right. Malcolm, what are you doing here? - Came to take you to lunch or dinner. - I'm busy. - Van Joyner. - Malcolm Wright. - How did you even know I was here? - I saw it online. Very impressive presence. - Oh thanks, thanks yeah. I'm gonna give you two a minute, yeah. - Oh, tomorrow, expect a whole new Tia. - I ain't even worried about it, aight? Aight brother. - You look incredible. - I only agreed to go to dinner with you to get you out of my office. - I just wanted to have a nice sit down dinner so we could talk. - I'm not falling for your tricks. You cheated, there's nothing to talk about. - Cheated is a stretch, all right? We kicked it, sure, but I don't want Cammie. You are my future. I just, I got scared. I thought that I could have my last little bit of fun before I made my commitment. - The ring was your commitment. - I was wrong Tia, damn! I'm sorry! Do you know how much money I've been puttin' out trying to apologize? What more do you want from me? - I just want you to stop! I don't trust you, period. And I know you didn't dip them damn strawberries. - Really? Tia! - You just gon' have your feet on the table like you at home? OK girl, you look like you bout to bring it today! - Oh yeah girl, I'm ready. - Yes, OK! Your cute self. - You ain't ready, you ain't ready. - All right man, let's go ahead and hop into this first segment of the day, Angry Black Woman. Go ahead, Tia. - All right yes, so today, I have a letter from Tahina. She caught her boyfriend going behind her back trying to sabotage a potential job because he didn't want her salary to be higher than his. She wants to know should she break up with him over this. - That's a good one. - Well I'll tell you what this angry black woman thinks. He's insecure and if you think it's going to stop there, you're wrong! Sis, he's always going to be competing with you and this is never going to work in a marriage. So if you wanna be his girlfriend forever and allow him to dictate your ceiling, then yeah, stay! But if you want a real relationship with someone who wants you to be your best self, he gots to go! That's what I say. That's all I'm saying. Shouldn't it be out? - Come on, bad self! - First of all, her name is Kahina. So her best self is off the table. - You know what, see there? That's why you need to know your history, young man. Let me school you right quick, OK? See, Al Kahina was a powerful African warrior who took command of a army so that the Arabs wouldn't be invading the land. To stop from losing, she burned the land down instead of seeing it taken over by non-African, what?! - Aha, boom! - You saw that knowledge hit him in the face like that? Real slick like? - You didn't know that. You didn't know that, Brianna, sit back. Shut up, this eh eh. - You know what? There are a lot of brothers out there who are too insecure or too white washed to handle a woman with a strong African name. Maybe our friend Austin here prefers names like Becky or Sissy. You know what it is. You guys, leave me a comment about that and I'll get at you tomorrow. Power to the people! - Woo! - Justin, Shannon! Don't touch me. - Yes, girl! - Hey guys, it's your angry black woman here. Make sure you keep those emailscoming and tune in tomorrow. We're going to be talking about jealous roommates. #SingleBlackFemale. - You up late. - You goin' out with Rick? - Butch. - I don't know how you do it. I can't date more than one man at a time without getting caught up. - That's 'cause you kiss. In my world and in my rule book, you never, ever, ever kiss. When I kiss, I'm ready to take it to the next level. - You're still doing that? - That is what keep em coming back, OK? Don't wait up, good night! Maybe I'll ask Butch if he got a little brother. - What's up brothers? Guess what. You've got your first gig. Austin and Brianna are often paid to host parties. You've been asked to host MySister's Keeper rooftop brunch. - Oh, that's great! - You might wanna think about getting yourself posters and negotiating the fees 'cause you bout to be busy, all right? - Awesome! - Nice flowers. - Hello ladies! Are you ready to excel?! - Hello Malcolm. - We got one hour. Frisco is in town this weekend and he wants to see me. - One hour, got it. - Now if you went on Tinder like I told you, you would've had a date. - Just hush and hold my arm! Oh and if anyone asks, you're my person. - Isn't that your co-host? - Yep. - Mm, he is a lot cuter in person. - What? - Yes, look at him. Look at him standing on his little tippy toes. You think he like older women? - Jillie. I thought higher of you. - What?! Look at his face, I will sit all on that. I'm just sayin'. - Hello. - Van, hi! This is such a fancy party. You know Jillie. - Oh yes, hi. - How are you? - Good, good, thank you. Ross Chow Media is our primary stakeholder. See there Ross Chow, the owner? He loves a good party. - Oh, she used to own the PR company that I work for. Sienna is a powerhouse. - Wait, I didn't know you worked in PR. - Yeah. - She's my publicist. - Oh, let me know if you need my services. - Hey, say no more darlin'. - I got you. - Knew I liked her, I knew I liked her. All right you ladies have fun. I'm gonna go ahead and mingle a little bit, OK? All right, good seeing you. - You too. - I see you lookin' at him. - What? No. - Let me see your eyes. You was lookin' at him. Come on, let's go. We can go get his number. Talk to him. - Don't do that, behave. - Shut up. - How y'all doin'? Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. Tonight we are celebrating five years. It's been an amazing ride but we've just scratched the surface. I wanna thank our producers, our executives, and of course, our sponsors because without you, we wouldn't even have a show. Last but not least, my three amazing hosts. Austin Bean. Brianna Williams! And our latest addition, Tia Logan. Without you guys, we definitelywould not have a show. Now, I must say, our newest segment has really taken off. Our subscriber base has reached one million. Tia Logan, please say something to the people. - That's my best friend! - I just wanna say I am so grateful for this new journey and I'm so happy that I get a open, honest platform to talk about love issues and raw emotions. Thank you Van, thank you Gossip Room for trusting me. I really look forward to contributing to the show's future success. Thank you guys so much. - Thank you baby. You look beautiful, by the way. On that note, toast, cheers y'all! - Tia. - Corley! - I thought I'd find you here. - Wow! - I'm sure it's good to know that you're the smartest flea in the sand box. - You are not about to do CC like that. How dare you say Ciara can't hold her own tour! - First of all, I love CC with her fine ass. I'm just sayin' she can't run a tour by herself! - OK, now ya trippin'! Tell him, Tia. - Yeah, I met Ciara once at a party. Sweet girl, tall too. - Cut for commercial. - Hey, you OK? You seem like you're a little off. - Yeah, I'm fine. - OK. - Brianna, come here. Where did you study journalism? I'm just curious. - Oh, I didn't. I got this job right after I reached two million followers. - I like Van. What should I do? - I don't know. You two go way back. Date him. - I mean, it could get awkward if he doesn't feel the same way. Plus I'm pretty sure it's against my work policy, so if I wanna keep my job, dating Van isn't an option. - All right, fine. Date him then. - Oh, eww. Yeah, I'm sorry teddy, ya touched it. Ugh, why do you have that in your guest bedroom? - Ya never know when ya need a little hot dog in your bun. Go on a dating app! You won't talk to Van and you better not talk to Malcolm. - Oh my God, you talk to Malcolm? - It was only like twice. - Give me your phone. I'm signing you up on a dating app. - No, no, no, no, no. - Yes, I don't care what you say. - Not a dating app. - Well, use this then. That's your best bet. - It's on me! Hmm. Hmm! - Trying to make you laugh. - I think I want dessert, you? - Now that you ask. Meet my wife, Crystal. We would love to have you for dessert. - Ah hell nah! You that angry back chick that's messin' it up for all the players over here? I'm out, swipe left. - You great. - I cannot remember the last time I laughed so hard. Thank you for tonight, thank you. - Oh no, thank you. I had fun, thank you. - Yeah, oh you know what, sincewe both like horror movies, we should go see that new movie. What's that movies, it's um, put out the um, is everything OK? - Yeah, yeah, just tallying. Your portion of the bill comes out to $49.87. I put the appetizer on your bill since you ate three-fourths of it, but I'll happily put one-fourth on mine. - Hi Malcolm. - You picked up. How are you? - I'm fine, just thinkin' about my Dad. How are you? - Good. I wanna see you. Tia. - I don't know, Malcolm. - Please just come over tomorrow night. How much pain are you gonna put me through? Please baby. Hey. Why didn't you use your key? - It's in the box of your stuff that I set on fire. Why are you playing Kenny Lattimore. You know I love some Kenny. - Come here. - You know, I'm a big fan of your work. I saw you. - Oh yeah, I'm a big fan of your hair cut lookin' like a geisha. - A what? - I need a massage. - What in the hell? Jillian! - Hey there, superstar! - What are you doing here? - Oh, Van wanted me to do some PR work for the show. - So I'm just here you know, doing old promos with her. - What is that? - It's nothing, go ahead. - It don't look like nothin'. - Is that the ring... You saw him? - It's just a piece ofjewelry, Jillian, it's nothing. - No, that's something! - You saw Malcolm. - It's just a piece of jewelry, it's nothing. - Really Tia? We had this conversation already. I can't believe you! - Get in my office. - The whole conversation and you just disregarded everything y'all talked, all right. I don't gotta know. - Really Tia? I can't believe you let that snake back in! - He's not back in. - Really? 'Cause you got Malcolm written all over your body. - Where? - A1 sauce. See, you gotta watch your surroundings. - You're right, what's up boss? What's goin' on? - Is Jillian still here? - I was feeling bad and I got weak. - Yeah, she actually goin' out on Tia right now about a ring. - Jillian, the dating thing isn't working. He called, so I went to see him. - And? - About a ring? - Yeah, I mean, I guess she went to go talk to her ex. She got a ring on her finger. She might be engaged, I'm tryin' to figure it out right now actually. - Well have Jillian see me before she leaves, OK? - Yeah, you know I got anything for you. - This is why I hired you for The Gossip Room. - I'm gon' go gossip. - Yeah, go gossip. - All right, boss. - In your office. - Yeah, in my office. - What's important is that it's not happening again. Never, ever. This is the last time. I hate sneaking around during lunch. - Well stop sneaking and move back in. - Mr. Grayson, I'm so sorry I'm late. My last meeting was good, bad. It ran over, I'm here. - All right. We had said some publishers are very excited to work with you still. So tell me your idea. - OK, I wanna take the stories of the women who have been reaching out to me and make a compilation of real stories. - And the stories are compelling. Some are even scandalous. - And you have the rights to these stories? - I will get them. I just wanted to test your interest. - I'll read a few, see if you got something there. Eh, I will be in touch. - Hey, that's a good start. Real good start. - Your lips. - All right world, how are you doing? Today's letter is from Mia. Mia has strong feelings for a really good friend but she's afraid that if shetells him how she really feels, it might affect what they have. - No, don't do that. Let it happen naturally, do not put yourself out there. Once you do that, you can't go back! And yo, once they break up with you, they gon' act like oh, they had the upper hand the whole entire time and that's not the case. Damn that. - You good, bro? You the angry black woman now? - Oh no, I'm good! I'm just sayin', you know what I'm sayin'. I'm just tryin' to help. - OK. - I saw be honest. Test the waters. Give him signals to let him know you're interested and see how he responds. If you get nothing, back up. But make sure he's single. Don't be that chick. - I wanna check in with you. I know it's been a couple of months. You still happy? - Yeah, I think I'm adjusted. - OK, you got a lot of fans. - Oh, I have a lot of enemies too, trust me. This one lady asked me for Malcolm's number because she said I obviously don't know how to keep a man. - Wait, so you two aren't back together? - Nope! - Can I get anything to drink for you two? - Yes, I will have a Hudson neat and the lady will have... You not gon' drink? - Oh, I thought you were gonna order for me. - I mean, I can make a suggestion but, you know your palette better than I do. - Well, in that case, the lady will have a glass of pinot grigio. So, I don't want this to get awkward because I know you're my boss but, I feel like there's something happening between us. - Tia. - Shelby! - Hi! And uh, who might this be? - This is my boss, Van Joyner. This is Shelby, my old co-worker. - Yes, Ivander Joyner right? - Yeah, that's me. - Yes, I think we interviewed you once when you first launched your gossip show. - Yeah. - Yeah! You know, for a second, Ithought I interrupted something. - Nope, nothing! Nothing at all. - Oh, you know, someone said you were working over there. - You know, we should have someone set it up so Tia comes on the morning show. I mean, since coming on ourshow, our numbers have increased and you know, she speaks at events all over DC. - Great idea! I'll have Tracy set up for next week! - Hmm, great! - Great! You know, I am so glad you didn't let that huge embarrassing debacle bring you down. I mean, losing a man and your job in front of everyone, whew, that is tough. But, so glad to see ya back on your two feet. Tracy'll call ya next week? - Great Shelby. - It was so nice meeting you. - Oh, wonderful. Nice to meet you too. - Thank you. I'm gon' let you guys keep lunchin'. All right, come on honey. - Take care, Shelby! - What's up, superstar? - Austin, what are you doing here? - Actually I wanna get to that in a second, but I have a question for you. Uh, you and Jillian, y'all close? - Yeah, she's been my best friend since high school. Why are you asking about her? - No reason. Van gon' be late, so here's some cards for support. - What's this? - Just some bullet points that I think you should mention. - Oh, I already have my bullets. - And here are a few more. You haven't read em, check it out. - Boy, I'm not talkin' about your weekly countdown show! It's not even on TV. - It's a village. I'm supposed to support you, you gotta support me back! - No, Austin. I already have enough to think about. - Tia, you wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for me. Man, I'm... - What? - Look, when you was wilin' out in the streets, I was gettin' a smoothie. I bumped the footage to Van. He thought it was funny, so we broke the story. It started to blow up on social media, he offers you a job, instant ratings. You got me to thank for your success! Remember that. - You ready to do this? Our next guest at Wake Up DC is no stranger to us. In fact, she used to host this morning show. Please welcome Tia Logan. - And thank you for having me, Shelby. I'm happy to be here. - Oh, it's great to have you here. I mean, ya look amazing. - Thank you. - Looks like life has been treating you well. - It has, it has. I never thought I would be on this side of the morning show, but here I am. - Yes, yes. Ya know, so let's go back. A few months ago, you broke the internet with a video that surfaced. In fact, we have it. - The wedding is off! - It's not what you think. - The wedding is off! - See Malcolm, you need to handle all this. - Wait, baby wait. - Bitch, what?! - So Tia, we all would like to know, are you still that angry woman? - No Shelby, actually, I'm not. I look at that situation as a blessing in disguise. Had that not happened, I wouldn't have discovered this beautiful career which I love so much. - And before we talk about that, we love to do where are they now? So, we reached out to your ex so we can get an update on his total annihilation. Please, please, let's give a warm welcome to Malcolm Wright. - What? - Malcolm, welcome. - Oh, thank you. Thank you for having me. - Oh, thank you for coming. So, Malcolm, tell us, how have you been? - Oh well Shelby, if you had asked me that a few weeks ago, I would've said terrible. But, now that I have my other half back, things couldn't be better. - Oh, how sweet! So, are you telling us that you two are back together? - No. - Well actually, Tia, I love you and I wanna spend the rest of my life making you happy. Will you please marry me? - Well? - I don't wanna do this here. - Believe me when I say that I know that there is no one I'd rather spend my forever with. We're gonna have a great life together. - Girl, are you gon' sit here and let that man pour his heart out in front of 3.5 million people? - 3.5? - Yes, it's gone up since I've become host. - Yes, yes I will marry you Malcolm. - That is beautiful! Look, you have heard it here first on Wake Up DC. #AngryBlackWoman is now #HappyBrideToBe. Again! We'll be right back. - What's up with you and what was up with Malcolm? What was that? - I didn't plan that. I didn't plan that. When were you gonna tell me? - Tell you what? - You used me! Austin shot the video and you broke the story. Oh, I respect your art. You the best of both worlds. It's all bullshit! - That was the truth! But I still got a job, Tia! I still got a job! - You know what, you're worse than Malcolm but at least Malcolm knows how to stand up and be a real man. - OK yes, OK yes, I should've told you, all right? I should've told you but I wanted you here because I know you still got so much more to offer, OK? - You know what, it's funny. I'm quitting for the exact same reason. I thought you were one of the good guys. - Man! - You did what? - I needed to forgive him. - Then say we're cool, don't say I do! - It's hard out here, Jillian. - Yeah, sure it is. - It is hard! And Malcolm wants to be with me. No, he's not perfect but at least he's trying. - You know who you sound like right about now? - So what? There's nothing wrong with wanting to have a good life, Jillian. The big picture is what's important. - But Tia, do you love him, honestly? - Yes! - Well, there you have it. I guess settling is the new love. - At least I'm willing to put myself out here even after I've been hurt. Yeah, you haven't given a man a real shot since Brooks left. Yeah you claim to be this, "Oh I'm a free spirited person," but it's all a facade. You never take any chances anymore, not with anything! - Well at least I don't keep making bad decisions! - It takes courage to keep getting back out here. What are you doing? - I'm not runnin' around here making people think I got it all. - Yeah, because you went around here sleeping with every Tom, Dick, and Butch. - Get out. Get out! - You know what? Can't tell you anything. - And take your stanky ass flowers with you! - This advice thing is a lot of pressure. I met this woman today who took her husband back simply because I took you back. - That's a good thing, right? - I guess. But what if she shouldn't have? She's lookin' at my life like it's perfect but... - It is perfect especially now that you over that angry black thing. I gotta say, that did not go over too well with the overheads at the firm. My father was certainly not impressed. - What are you lookin' at? - Give me back my phone. - What's the problem? I can't look through your phone? - You can look through my phone, but you should ask instead of just grabbing it from me. I know you don't trust me. - Should I? - I don't have anything to hide. I promise. Go ahead, look. - Fine then, I will. - Uh huh, told you. I'm doin' right by you, baby. - TJ called me about coming back to the station to be a field reporter. - You should. - But I don't know if I wanna go back to that old, stuffy job. - That's the beauty of being married to me. You can go back to work or you can just be Mrs. Wright. - Logan-Wright. - I'll just call you mine. Now seriously, I gotta get back to work. - Oh, I signed us up for Paint and Sip tomorrow. - I'm sorry about the paint thing. - It wasn't a thing. It was supposed to be a date. - I should pick the dates from now on. - It's not always going to be about you, Malcolm. - Look, compromises are hard for me. - Marriage is one big compromise. - I know. I know. So please be patient with me. I'm a work in progress. You know what? Why don't we just go down to the courthouse this Friday. I mean, let's just go ahead and do it. I don't want to wait and besides, I don't have time to plan anything big. - You didn't really plan the last one. - Tia. All I care about is marrying you. - OK. But since the reception is paid for, can we still do the party next month? - Sure, whatever my baby wants. - Don't do that. Let it happen naturally. Do not put yourself out there. Once you do that, you can't go back and yo, once they break up with you, they gon' act like, oh they had the upper hand the whole entire time and it's not the case. Damn man. - You good bro? You the angry black woman now? - Oh no, I'm good. I'm just sayin', you know what I'm sayin', just trying to help. - OK. - I say be honest. Test the waters. Give him signals to let him know you're interested and see how he responds. If you get nothing, back up. - I'll tell you. I'll show you a picture. Don't button it up, I like it open. - You like it open? - Yes. - I like it closed. - Hey Van. - Hey, what up, dawg? - How y'all doin'? - No just... - Open it again. - That's definitely in. You are hilarious. - That's cute. - May I set a dressing room for you? - Sure. Uh, let's see. This one too. Thank you. - Get in here. Grayson called me about the book. - I know, I guess it wasn't meant to be. - What?! No, I'm not gon' let you give up! I thought it was a really good idea. - Hm, you cookin'? - No, you know I don't cook. - Smells like you burnin' something. - I don't cook. I need to get the elephant out the room. I'm sleeping with Austin. - I'm still marrying Malcolm. Wait, that's the elephant?! - I know. I just gotta get it off my conscience. Listen, I know he's young but what he lacks in age, he makes up for in bed. You hear me? He's so young, he's so vibrant. He just stimulate my whole body. He just do somethin' to me like you see it right now? It's happening, you know? - Oh God, the last thing I need is the image of you and Austin. - Shut up. You talk to Van? OK, he talked to Ms. Rashild about what happened on the morning show. She made a call. Once again, Shelby is field anchor. So it's bye bye DC! - What? - Yes, so I told you that woman was powerful! - Oh my God! - I couldn't stand her anyway! - Oh my gosh, I hated her. - They needed to just fire her. I don't know why they holdin' onto her. - I know, let her go! - They might as well just take you back. - I'm here. - I'm sayin'! - Right! That's why you my best friend. - I know. We should take a girl's trip this weekend. What? - I'm getting married Friday. Hey, this is Tia. I'm unavailable right now. Please leave a message. - Hey Tia, it's Van. I sent a text the other day. I thought I'd just leave a message. I um... I need to talk to you about your key card. You still have it. - It might've cost me a bag, but I did it and I got my girl back. Now what? Can't keep a winner down, baby. - Go ahead babe, I need to find a parking spot. - You're coming in, aren't you? - If I find a parking space, maybe. If not, it's up to the universe. Go on now! - Hurry up! - Good luck. - Oh there's my baby right there. - Uh, how you doin'? - Good! - Let me see this. Come on, let's see this. Let's take this right here. Look at that! Hey baby, come on. Why don't you tell the world how much you love me, hmm? All right OK, look, tell the people, you know, how glad you're happy to have your man back. Yeah. - Oh, I can't marry you. - Come on, stop trippin' babe. Tell the people. - Hey world. You wanna know how much I love Malcolm Wright? Not as much as I love myself. I can't marry you, Malcolm. - What? - This isn't real but one day, I hope that we both can find someone who can appreciate and love us for who we truly are. - Dude, are you still live? - Oh, I was just about to walk over. - Relax, I'm not getting married. - What? What did he do? - Calm down, calm down. He didn't do anything. Malcolm is who he is and I was silly enough to believe that that was enough and for somebody, it will be. But I just realized that I need and deserve so much more. - And what made you realize that, T? T, this face! - I know. - Oh, you know what, you know I'm here if you need me, if you need a place to stay, you know I got you. - I'm getting my own place. - Say that again. - I'm getting my own place. - You know what you be doin'! - OK girl, you don't have to be so happy! - You don't understand, you was takin' up my space. My goodness! - You know what? I think it's time for me to get reacquainted with the real me. - You know what? I like the real you. Free girl. - Yeah! - She be a little bitter sometimes, but she all right. - Ah, the past is the past. Oh girl, listen! Coming! I said I'm coming! Damn, I just. I said I'm comin'! Just hold on, just... - I need to see your book. - What book? - The one I'm publishing. - Oh my gosh, ah! - Tia, Tia! You know I don't like all that mushy stuff. Give me a high five or something. Look, I know you said I don't take chances anymore. So, if I'm gon' step out there, why not take a bet on somebody I believe in? - Oh my God. I've already started collecting the stories. Wait, hoo, hoo, hoo. - Tia, what are you doin'? - Here. Girl, all kinda stories. Races, religions, everything. This is gonna be so dope. - And since it's already written, it's just a matter of editing. And I know tons of editors. Might take a few weeks. - Really? - Yes. - That's my best friend, that's my best friend, friend, friend, aye, get it friend! Aye, that's my friend! Hey! Oh, oh, you know what we should do? We should plan a huge release party and announce the book and your publishing. - I like that. You know what? I'm gon' start lookin' for venues. - No need! I know the perfect place. - Hey, hey! - Yes, lookin' like a cherry popsicle. Come on in. Hey love. Hi! - Hi, I'm with WBX News. - Yeah. - Your face looks so familiar. - Oh nope, I don't know you. You look good. - What do you mean you don't know me? - Purple little shirt. - You know, I need to get in there. - Oh you don't, 'cause sir, she's not allowed to come in. You have a good day, Betty Bo Peep, bye! - It's my assignment. I'm with WBX News. What is her name? - You kissed him! - What, no I didn't. - I saw you! - No, you're seeing things. I don't know what you're talkin' about. - I'm not seeing anything but that kiss. - Tia, don't you have something to do? - I am so excited about tonight and the release of my new book! I'm even more excited to be doing this project with my best friend, Jillian James. Proud of us. In my journey over the last year being the angry black woman, I realized that most of the women I came across had the same thing in common. Loneliness. Most times, it's the root of our anger, our jealousy. And for me, I desired to be accepted. Loneliness breaks the spirit and no one can soar with a broken spirit. But, after receiving several thousand emails from women all across the country, I realized that we never need to feel lonely. Why? Because we're all dealing with the same concerns, the same issues, the same insecurities. We just need to connect to each other. And I hope that my new book can bridge that gap. The Joy Of Losing It All is a compilation of 100 stories from women who lost or walked away from everything and in the process, found themselves. These are uplifting stories, heartfelt stories about women who rose from the ashes, dusted themselves off, and decided to soar. Can the authors who are in the house tonight come and join me up here? Just right here, yeah. Thank you. Gloria lost her son and the foundation in his honor has fed thousands of kids. Keisha escaped an abusive marriage and she mentors girl all around the world. Listen hey, I can keep going. But what I wanna do right now is read to you just one of the amazing stories so you can see what I'm saying. I'm in my 30's and I'm a pretty powerful person when it comes to my career. I'm driven by work. It has been the only thing that is motivating me over the years. So much so that I related my personal value to my career success. Eventually, my brand became my career. I was fine with that until I hurt someone I cared about, which made me reevaluate what was important. Success doesn't matter if you lose yourself in the process. Maybe that's why it's lonely at the top. But after losing this person, I realized that I don't wanna be at the top by myself. I found someone to walk this journey with and I'm hoping I can get a second chance to show... that I am really one of the good guys. - I'm sorry, Tia. Let me start over. - Wow, that's one woman who won't be angry or lonely for a long time! - So um, I've been thinking. I really miss being on the show. Think I can come back? - No. We ain't gonna have no time to be on The Gossip Room when we're busy prepping your own show every day. - My own show? - I mean, that is, if that's still your dream and everything. - Yes. - Is it still your dream? - Mmhm, mmhm. - Mmhm. - Mmhm! - Your dream is my dream, OK? OK. - Hi, hi, hi! Hi! - Hi! May I help you? - Yes, yes. I'm Shelby Steele and I'm with WBX News, right? And I'm supposed to be in there like right now, but some woman, she kicked me out. He knows who I'm talkin' about. Could you, I don't even know who she is. - We don't like the words kicked out. Let's just say you were selectively dismissed. - Select... wait. OK, what just happened? 'Scuse me, uh, lady? Uh, lady in red. Get your girl. OK, y'all workin' together. OK, white people involved now, OK it's gotten real. All right, I'm out here on the red carpet. Media pass. Whatever happened to black magic, huh? - Hello ladies! Are you ready to excel? - Yeah! - I love this energy! Nice! Woo! All right! I am Tia Logan, the angry black woman, and I, you saw the show right? You saw the show, yes. I'm the angry black woman and I am here to help you release, right? - Yeah, yes. - Yes, right? I think the best way to get this started is just to dig in with your questions, right? So uh, let's just talk. - I'm going to start right in. Do you think it's unhealthy to go through your man's phone? - Me too. I would like to ask that. - You would say yes. I'm sick as hell. - Oh my goodness, ladies. I mean, who hasn't done that, right? Right, come on, let's just be real with each other here tonight, right? I can admit, I have done my fair share of snooping, but I found that it just made me more anxious even when I found nothing. But on the other hand, had I gone through Malcolm's phone, maybe I would've caught the lyin' bastard! Right? You know what I'm sayin'? Right, I say go through his phone! Give me some, give me some! You gotta do what you gotta do, right? Just don't get caught. - You got it. - Yeah. - Were all three of you in on this? - No, this was all my idea. - We should go dance. Let's go dance. - I don't dance. I don't dance! Oh, you tryin' to dance, dance. - Let's dance. - Hey y'all, we're gon' be back. - We're not comin' back. - We not comin' back. Y'all do y'all thing. - Well I also may not dance but you know I bust a move baby. - Oh really? - Yeah really. - Oh, let me see what you talkin' bout. Whoa, like that? - You see what I'm sayin'? Like that. - But you did it, but you did it!
