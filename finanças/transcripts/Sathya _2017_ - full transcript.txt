That's the car. Ok. Make it quick! Ok. Hey, go and get the car! Riya. Riya. Riya. Riya. When are we suppose to send the 'X' to Bangalore? Ok. I'll get it ready for you by 6. That means we have to get it done by 4. Ok. Finishing of foreigners... will cost a bit more. - No. No! No! - Please! Don't shoot. Please! - Please! No! - Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! No! No! Please! Please! Olha! Olha! Olha! VRC company shares are dropping. So our project has been delayed. So what you are saying is, they can't meet the deadline. Yeah because QA is taking time. But Shylock... Why did you suggest R and D in the first place? Yes, because even R and D is taking time. Sorry. Go ahead. So, anyway... we have to make this delay stop. - Therefore we have to put our heads together. - Sorry. I gotta take this. What's the hurry? I was in a board meeting! Why were you calling repeatedly? Fine. Let's go. Now, whose car is this? From where did you get it? I turned my toy car into this one. Now drive! Here. Hold my bag. It's a small car, so make sure you fold in your long legs. Now, tell me already! There is a girl. Stacy. Today's plan is to meet her. Why do you wanna play cupid? I am free today, so I thought why not play cupid? Will you obey me or not? Ram! Please. Sathya! Please. For four years I obeyed you. So obey me for once at least. Who is Stacy? Who is that Stacy? I don't even remember where I met her. You both met at my birthday party. She told me that she liked you very much. That is why I fixed up this blind date. - No! - Yes! That side. Stacy is the girl with beer in her hand. So you better head with some hot wings. - Fool! - Thanks. I know. I know. This is weird. I don't usually do this kind of thing either. At the party... You were really nice... and I thought... why not ask Sathya on a date. Oh! Umm... Is it ok to call this... a date? You know what? I can't do this. You deserve better. Waiter. I'm sorry. - Message 1: - Sathya! How could you be so rude? Stacy is my colleague. How could you insult her? How will I face her again? Well... only if donkeys ever knew the fragrance of scent! You are just like that. In order for you to score, I play my part of wing man so perfect.. and you let it go waste? She is really furious at me. Over that you switched off your mobile! You are only worth of sitting in your room and being a drunkard! Now hang up! Message 2: - Hi Sathya... It's me... Swetha here. How are you? I got your number from our friends. I am not sure if you are using this number. If you are and if you get my message... the can you please call me? Please. My number... '99490...' '12233.' Hello. Ignoring the date I set up for you, where are you off to? - To India. - For what? To sister's house. To attend a wedding. Hey! She is my sister. I, myself am not attending it. Your sister? She is sister to both of us. You aren't ready to give up on your salary. - Not everyone's like you. - Stop acting! I am not good at it. Everybody knows it. Come to the point. Isn't it for her? Come on. She said she wants to meet me. I'm going. That's it. So, what should I tell Stacy? You take her out instead. She went out with you even after knowing its a blind date. The only way she'll go out with me is if she is blind. What do I tell at work about your absence? What's your sister's name? Hello? Ram is not his desk right now. Do you wanna pass any information? Yeah right! Put aside your English speaking course for later. First tell me why money is deducted from my salary? Who are you sir? Your mew-maw! Apart from the loss of pay and tax why is extra money being deducted? Does confronting the HR makes you... a thug? Don't you know the procedure? - Whatever it is, just email it and it'll be looked into. - Hello! You are being paid here to answer us! So, answer me! You better show some respect! Weekly 3 days you are one leave. Then 2 day in a months you never turn up. You use up all the casual leave and medical leave. First... learn to sit at your work station for at least half an house continuously. - How dare you? - Hello! What's your employee number? '50310.' What can you do? Hello? Hello! - Hello? - Why are you yelling buddy? Stop mocking me or else... I'll hurl things at you! Why were you not in your seat? Some girl, attended the call and hanged it up half way! Why do you recruit such wretches? In order to work in a company like this, arrogance is the primary quality! See him? He is a petty burglar who tried flicking an officer's wallet. He was immediately recruited here. - What about you? - I am a thug! I've finished of many of them. I too was recruited immediately. Yeah right! Dude! The wretch who mocked you over the call... That's her. - That girl? - Yes. This fellow! Oh! Oh! - How dare you mess with my salary? - Hey, Sathya, where are you going? - Let's leave dad! - What happened? Let's leave. Pooja's friend. Nope. He is my friend. - Three things. - What? 1. I like you. Even after knowing the caller was pissed off, you still dealt it in a calm manner. That dealing... was indeed awesome. 2. I like the respect you have for your father. The minute they starts to earn... every girl thinks they can handle it all but amidst such girls... you still get picked up by him after work, just like a school kid. That discipline... - is something out of this world. - Are you stalking me? 3. Physique. - Oh! What do I say? - What? Who are you and what rubbish are you talking? I mean... structure. No matter how angry your eyes are... that cute little smile by the corner of your lips... that's the best curve I like in your whole body. Very nice. I like all these about you. But I don't like you a bit! That's how a girl's father is supposed to be. Phew! My part is done. Do remember this average looking fellow. We will be meeting very often. By the way... I'm Sathya. Employee number 50310. Actually, Mr. Shadow like father... I don't have many points. I got just one point. He just made a fool out of you. Your name? Thomas Alva Edison Mubarak Muruga. Daddy, well... I have three things to tell... Three things I... completely hate about you. 1. Acting like you are the man around... you left me stranded in a check mate, in front of my dad. I couldn't say anything. Your cheap tactics... I hate that! 2. You run your mouth in front of my dad and... then shake his hand and hug him? That arrogance... I hate that. 3. You were here all the time yet... you were stalking me for two weeks. That cheap stalking... I didn't like it. Yet... me being a high maintenance chick, the guys around say I've an attitude and call me arrogant. They keep their distance from me. But you dared to come closer to me. That too when my dad was around. I like that courage of yours. So... if you need any more details about me, don't call up to the land-line. Call me on my mobile. Remember! If you keep disturbing me just because you got my number... Mind you! I always carry a knife with me. - Be careful! - Hey! Watch out! My phone! By the way... I'm Swetha. HR department. Hi, pizza girl. It's yours you left that day. You can give it to your kid. I love you. If I don't say I love you to you, will you leave me and go? Shweta, I don't have any conditions. - But every relationship has one. - Yes. But as a lover I promise you, I will always be with you. No matter what comes. No matter what. When I was a child, I always used to tell my mother that I loved her. But she didn't live with me for long. When I was in 10th grade I proposed to my friend, that stupid fellow kissed my best friend. Then try saying, I hate you. You'll surely have them with you. Satya, I don't know the meaning of life. Because whoever I loved, didn't stay with me. Shweta, people who understand don't fall in love. It's just a feeling. Even if you don't have your mother, you love her, don't you? It's the same. - Sathya. - Thank you sir. Hello dear sister, Hema. It's me. I've reached Chennai. Excuse me. Hello boss. Chief, someone's here for you. Obviously. I am the boss not you! - Welcome sir. - Hi. Can I rent a car? Rent a car? - You! Go bring two cups of tea. - Ok chief. Got any idea? Idea? Well, any government certified documents that proves you are really you. I mean something like that. You mean Id? Yes, that what's I said too, idea. Do you have? I've my passport. Does that work? Passport? - Listen! - Cancel the tea. - Get beverages. - Ok chief. Rent is 5000 bucks. Then for the diesel, pollution control charges etc. altogether it comes to 10,000 bucks. - 10,000? - Yeah! Come on sir. I am here to rent a car and you quote a price to rent a plane! That will cost you even more. Sir... Listen, tea sounds better. - You got Spice tea? - Yes sir. Get me that. Spice tea? That means you are one of us. - Cancel the juice and get the tea. - Ok chief. Well, the spice tea has me at your behest. Rent is just 2000 bucks. - Pay it and you may have the car. - Thank you. I am Babu Khan. Babu Khan? What else did you expect? Shahrukh Khan? No one's gonna name me that. My name is actually Bismillah Khan. Since, I look like a Biriyani vendor, I changed it to Babu Khan. Nice. Isn't it? - Nice meeting you. - Ah! Nice meeting you. Come, let me show you the car. Please get in. Religion blockbuster songs are there. You may enjoy them. Please don't mind sir. Just 2000 bucks rent... but... no one pays the rent on time. They rent out cars like bicycles. I can see them driving around but no one cares to pay. Like in comedian Vadivel's comedy scenes. I love Vadivel's comedy a lot. What about you? Sir! What's wrong about it? (7.4.18) - Hi - Hi Sathya. Sit. How are you? I'm fine. Well... what's with the scar on your face? Swetha. Are you ok? Sir. - 2 Cappuccino. - 2 Cappuccino. 2 Cappuccino? - Make it fast. - Ok sir. Then... what's with the beard? Well...just like that... Looks good. Nice. How are you? I'm good. Marriage? Any children? Family? Marriage?! Family, well... it's just me and my friend. That's it. But what about you? Any kids? One daughter. - Riya. - Oh! So... a happy family. Right? Swetha, its been years... and only now you remembered me? Ok... over the call you said that you had something important to tell me. What is it? Well... I need your help Sathya. What? It was Riya's first day of school. By then, we were already an hour late. She wasn't willing to go, it was me, who got her ready with great difficulty and took her to school. Is my Riya darling afraid? Don't worry. Ok? You will find many new friends in the school. I don't wanna go! My Riya darling have fun at school! I won't go! Come on. Stop crying. Its just for an hour. Once done, every one will praise Riya! When will you come to pick me up? I'll be here only. Once dad arrives, we will leave together. Give me a hi-fi! Good girl! Would love to take Dora along? Fine. Take it. It's in the back seat. My darling! Hello. Yeah. Yeah. No worries. Since then my life has changed Sathya. Riya has been... kidnapped by some strangers. Sathya... I need your help. Can you find out Riya, for my sake? Please! I need your help. I left India because of you Swetha... and now I'm back, again because of you. Should I be angry that you left me? Or... should I be happy that I'm still in your memories? I have no idea. When you told me that your kid was kidnapped... I saw the desperation in your eyes. I saw the tears in your in eyes. I couldn't bear to see you in that state. Day by day my hope of finding Riya is dying. There is no response or any proof. No one's helping. I couldn't take it. That's when... I recollected what you told me. I will always be there for you. No matter what! I believed life was all about our love. But now everything about it are mere memories. Whatever you told me back then... is what has given me hope now. I am requesting you this believing that you really meant every word you said. Sathya, help me find Riya! I'm not being selfish. I am asking you because this is my last resort. I've been wandering round, looking for her, like a retard! Did you see my daughter Riya anywhere? - I don't know. - No madam. I filed a complaint with the police. You have no idea how many times I've been to that police station. Any news? How many times will you ask? Didn't you already speak to the ACP? Any clue... My husband, Gautham... is also helpless. I'm asking you Gautham! Where is Riya? Riya is untraceable Sathya. If not you... then who else can I depend upon? Swetha... what happened to the Police investigation? They claim to have stopped the investigation. They say that nothing can be done further. Like they were done! Officers are already done with this investigation. Sign here. What? How come without any conclusion... they can put an end to the investigation? Hey, speak out! - Hey, speak out. - Sir, please sir, don't beat me. Sir, the T Nagar file? Yes. Close it. Swetha madam! Welcome. How are you? Hope you are doing fine? Any luck? Madam, wouldn't I have informed you if so? Well, I thought you might have some new information... Case is closed madam. How can I give information when nothing exist? Excuse me! How can you be so careless? She just lost her daughter. Hello! Who are you? - Friend. - What do you mean by friend? He is a family friend. Look here madam, if you bring along some family friend and question me... still how I do I bring this child if it doesn't exist at all? Oh come on sir! Isn't it your duty? Hello? Tell me. Did you file the FIR? Is it? Hey! How dare you open the file without permission? Officer, put it in the store room. Look here boss... mind your own business. We very well know how to do our duty. - Got it? - Sir... - ACP wants to meet you. - Coming. Just because they have closed the case... how can I let it go? Sathya... it's my daughter. Swetha... do you have any photos of Riya? Did you guys have any issue or spat with anyone? Friends, family, business, money matter or anything like that? Nothing like that. No one even called up demanding any ransom. Then... what about Gautham? Gautham... was fully lost in his work. He is controlling his emotions. Shall I try talking to Gautham? Gautham doesn't know anything about you. I haven't told him. Can you recognize those guys who knocked you unconscious? Sathya, they were all wearing masks. I didn't get any chance to see their faces. I was unconscious too. If I knew what I had to do... I would have already done it Sathya. I wouldn't have disturbed you. What are you up to? No calls! Not even a message! She left you for someone. Why do you want to bother if her kid is kidnapped? It's not some stranger who had asked my help. Swetha! Listen Sathya... you aren't Superman! You say Swetha was knocked down and her daughter is kidnapped. What if someone attacks you? What if someone tries to kill you? Think! Think about her situation! Why should I? Did she ever think of you in these past 4 years? Buddy, let me tell you, girls come to their ex only when they have a problem. - Come on. It's not like that. - Shut up! Get on the flight early morning... and come here and fall in love with Stacy! I'll do the ground work. Okay? Doesn't have a steady mind, here or there! Damn it! And over that he keeps eating almonds! May have your access card sir? - Sorry. - Thank you. - Sathya sir. - Babu Khan. What happened, sir? Leaving so early? Is your work done? - Take you money. Take it, its yours. - It's okay, sir. I was acting. Come on sir, I'll drop you at the airport. - I'll go on my own. - I'll drop you, sir. Let's go. - Thank you. Here key. - Give it to me. What is it sir? You seem to be worried about something. Money problem? Or is it a girl problem? So a girl problem? The you must worry. Just speak out sir. My heart wants one thing... but mind wants something else. Always listen to your heart sir. It will never betray you. I need your help. Sathya, help me find Riya. Babu Khan! Turn the car. That's awesome! To the hotel? Hello Ram... I cannot leave Swetha in this situation and return. I had promised her! I feel I must live up to it. I don't mind if you judge me or not. I can't return until I find this kid. SATHYA. Tell me Sathya. Two months ago, a small kid was kidnapped. That kid studied in this school. Kidnapped? When? June 11th. Her mom was knocked unconscious outside the school... before abducting her. No way. Nothing of that sorts happened here. What do you mean? Even the police had investigated! How can you say that nothing happened? - It was outside this school... - Nope. Nothing like that took place outside our school. I think someone has given you wrong information. So... why are you inquiring about it? Well, I was planning to put my son in this school. But some say that this incident is true. It's all a rumor. We guarantee the safety of your son. Nothing to worry. How can I not worry? A child is kidnapped! Until today the kid is untraceable! Here. This is the kid's photo. Her name is Riya. I think you must have got the wrong school. Like I said, nothing of that sorts happened around here. Very cute child. Poor girl. Was she kidnapped? I'll come tomorrow and we shall discuss it then. - Excuse me. Sir, excuse me. - I will come. One minute. Sir, two months ago, a kid was kidnapped from this school. Do you know anything about it? Who are you? Actually, I am planning to put my boy... Are you a cop? No sir. Security! Handle it. - Sir, I am talking to you and.. - Yes tell me. Wait. Hey! - Sir please. - Leave! - Sir. Sir. - Leave! Now! Sir, please don't upset him. Leave. Idiot! Why are you creating unnecessary issues? I'll be back to India in 3 days. Take Bobby's help if you need anything. Where are you? Well, I... I'm in the balcony. Just getting some fresh air. - I've warned you many times! - Gautham! - Please! - Get inside! Well, Sathya... I met the school principal. She says she knows nothing. She refuses to recognize Riya. If you had a child, will you put that child in such a school? An act of kidnap took place just outside the school! So you mean, to save the school from any kind of shame or embarrassment... she lied to me? Of course. They are hiding the truth to save their business. Swetha, do you have any other photos of Riya? Not as of now. Something. In your phone or in your Facebook profile. I hardly got any friends. Forget about this Facebook and all. Gautham doesn't like it. Ask him and he'll say "when I'm here what else do you need?" Swetha I am talking about Riya's photo! I don't have any other photos. Is there not even a single photo at home? Hey! Bobby! Bobby? My husband's brother! Go! Please go! Bobby? - Swetha... - Just leave. Sorry, I'll call you later. Who's there with you? My brother wanted me to check on you. I was at a rave party last night. It was mind blowing! A Russian gave me a rare drug. It freaking blew my mind! It went on till early morning 4! Do you wanna try it? What do you say? Do you want me to call Gautham? For what? He doesn't like these stuff. Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! Bobby! - Sorry! Sorry! - Out! Now! - Sorry. - Please! Ok. Ok. Just get the hell out of here now. Sorry! Get out now! Will you? Do not tell on me to my brother. Ok? Ain't I like your brother? No? Naughty! Bye. Yo sister! Soul sister! I don't want a sister! Whenever Gautham is out on business visits to Dubai... he sends him to check on me. Wonder who will save me from him now? Swetha, do you have Bobby's phone number or his address? Don't worry. I'm here to solve the issue. I won't blow it up. Ground floor. Excuse me. Up. Do you know Swetha? Her husband is Gautham. - In the 8th floor right? - Yes. When did you see their child last? They have a kid? No sir. There is only one apartment in every floor. I don't mingle much with anybody. Sorry. Ok. Thank you. Who are you? Why do you wanna know all these details? - Hello? - Hello. - Bobby? - Yeah. Couple of months back, did someone kidnap your brother's daughter? Hey! Who are you? Are you a cop? Reporter in Times of India. Idiot! - Hello. - Hello? Where are you Sathya? - You are late for the function. - I'm starting now. I'll be there. Make it fast. Ten minutes. (7.4.18) Where is Vanaja? Everyone will be here on time. Come on now! Where is Ram? You came but he didn't! He has important meeting to attend. Hence he couldn't make it. Wonder what's so important about the meeting? He is my only brother. He could have made it, if he wished. Just leave it now. You know what? Vanaja... - Dear sister... - Yes. did you know that a child was kidnapped from a school at Besant Nagar? Do you know anything about it? - Which school? - Nope. I don't know. It took place outside a pre-school in Besant Nagar. A 4 year old was kidnapped. Any idea? I didn't hear about it. Obviously, many such incidents keep happening here. The impact remains only for 2 days, at the maximum. The city has turned really dangerous. Do you know... 4 years ago he moved to Australia along with Ram. He is my blood and he didn't come but look he is here. By the way, who is he? He is also like a brother to me. Right from childhood he hangs out with my brother at our house. Back then he was this small. Isn't that obvious? Please do laugh for his joke. So, where do you live here? What about your parents? Are they here or in Australia? Quiet now! His parents passed away long ago. - Did I ask anything wrong? - Shut up! It seems you persuaded them to send you on site? Are you getting bored here? Doofus! I'm doing this for you. I shall work abroad for few years, earn well and then if I ask your hand in marriage... I hope your dad might accept. Yeah right! Hey Swetha... I love you. Can't you hear me?! Hey! Come on now! What is it? It's not like I demanded your dad's wealth! Can't you give me back at least an "I love you?" Hey! That's my dad calling. I'm leaving. - I'm leaving. - Swetha! You better say it or I'll talk to your dad! Leave me Sathya! To home! Now! Swetha. Why did you come here? Swetha, get inside. It's ok Swetha. Stay right here. We are in love sir. Didn't I make it clear that I don't like you? I said it clearly in Tamil. Don't you understand? You aren't a bad person Sathya. But... you don't know how to conduct yourself. No manners at all. It might be cool for you to talk about my daughter's structure in front of me. But it's not so for me. It might be cool for you to hold my daughter's hand in front of me. But it's not so for me. It's not your fault. Only if you had parents... they would have taught you manners. The problem is with the way your were raised. The problem is not in the way I was raised but the way it is looked upon. There is nothing wrong is praising Swetha's smile and anger. In fact even loving her isn't wrong. You only saw me holding Swetha's hand... but do you have any idea how much she trusts me? Only after knowing that she trusts me completely... I held her hand. Me without Swetha and... Swetha without me... can exist... but... we won't be happy with our lives. Swetha's marriage... is already decided. Earlier, I thought I will ask her before finalizing it... but now... I think I just have to impose it on her. The groom isn't like you. He is disciplined. He has grown so big in his business that he is helping me today! He is the one for Swetha. Swetha's marriage has been fixed! Now.. leave! Swetha... will you marry me? Think and let me know. Sathya. My mother's wedding dress. What about your dad? Let's get married and... then we will convince him. Sathya! So, where have you planned your honeymoon? I haven't planned anything yet. Come on! Did you knock her up? What do you mean? Well, it means isn't she already carrying? Hey! Hey! You pig face! Ready? - Come on. - Sathya! Remember what I told you earlier? Mom... Love... I feel it Sathya. Right now! I hate you! No manners at all. She has been hanging on to you for long. Put her down. Aren't you here to get married? Stop over acting. Now go! - I'll finish you! - Go! Don't you have manners? Now go! Is this the time to pamper each other? Come, lets too try something similar. My slippers, your face! I saw you hugging the watchman yesterday! Come on. - He's a crackpot. Greetings. - Welcome. Today and tomorrow are not auspicious days. How about postponing? Correct swami! How do you expect time to be auspicious when these brats are here? Shut up! Swami... we are going to get married here in the presence of god. Then why worry about auspicious time? Swetha... call for you. Hello? I hope it's a happy news. What happened? What happened? Aren't you getting range here? - Swetha, I'll come... - Stay here. - Hello. - Don't hang up. I want to hear what the doctor has to say. Daddy! They say, its stage 4. I thought I had some problem... but... never expected it would be cancer. If I had been treated 6 months earlier... I could've been saved, they say. Swetha! What's going on? - Hello. - Hello. Yes? - Where are you? - I am coming. Dear sister... Listen. Sorry. Thank god. I didn't spill the liquor. Excuse me. Sir, you missed your wallet. Excuse me. Your purse. I need to talk to you. Sir, who are you? Remember that kidnapping... Sir, aren't you the one who created issues when my master was leaving? Police? Now tell me. The kidnapping. What do you know? Sir, I don't know anything about it. I need to watch the CCTV footage. I need the footage for time around 8:30. Why did it skip? How? The footage just jumped from 8:30 to 11:45? Where is the in between footage? That's when the kidnapping took place. Sir, I've no idea. Police came here one day. My master asked me to leave immediately. I don't know what happened after that. I need that footage. - It will be in master's office. - He won't give. - You must help me. - There is a copy. But it's at my master's office. It cannot be taken without his permission. I might lose my job if I try. Look here. I need that footage. How much should I bribe you? Sir! Are you indeed a cop? - Why? - Usually its the other way around. You are the first cop who offered bribe. So... the video? Leave you number. I'll check the video and call you. That's my number. Do call me. Do you have the footage of the day before? Bobby?! Did the police get Bobby's statement during investigation? They took everybody's statement. Including Bobby's, I hope. I need Bobby's statement. Can you get it? Why? What happened? Right now, I only have questions. Once I find the answers, I'll let you know. Trust me. Hmm. Ok. Sir! Hello sir. - Ganesh. - Yes sir... - How are you? - How are you? Very fine. How is Chennai treating you? New place. So its treating me ok. - Fine sir. - Sir meet the new assistant. Reddy. - Reddy! - Welcome sir. Reddy, whats the news on me? People say that you are very rude to the culprits and you rip them apart. That has already began doing rounds? Who started it? Who started it? The god father?! I asked, who started it. Give me the names and phone number who said that. Sir, well... I said give me their phone numbers! Sir, well...no... Fine, what do you think about me? But you just arrived. So wondering when will I exit? Sir! No sir. - Sir, no sir. - You! Hey! Sorry sir. - Ganesh. - Sir? Why is he sobbing like a small child? Sir, ACP wants to meet you. - Tell, I'm coming. - Ok sir. Reddy are you ready? Ready sir! Damn it! This is not allowed. Warn him! Good morning madam. Chowdhary... good to see you. Shankar... hand him the OMR land case file. - Welcome to Chennai. - Thank you ma'am. Good luck. Come on. Ma'am, Swetha is here to meet you. - Send her in. - Please come. Hey Swetha! Come. Come. Sit. How are you feeling? I need to talk to you. Tell me. I can't come along with you. - Sir forget the formality. We can talk. - Hold on wait! Hello? Just stepped out. What happened madam? What can we do Ganesh? I understand her situation. Get into her shoes and think. Babu Khan! Why are you following us? Stop! Stop! Hey! Throw it to me! Fast! Stop! Now, get up! And turn around slowly. Where is Riya? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know who Riya is. - Tell me. - I don't know! No! No! No! Please! Please! Please! Please! I asked, where is Riya?! Tell me. Please! Please! I don't know? Hi! Sathya sir. Welcome. Everything fine with the car? Who were those Africans? Answer me Babu Khan! Do you know Bobby? Bobby? Who's that? Stop acting Babu Khan. I saw you. They were looking for some address. I guided them. So if you guide them, they are supposed to pay you? The address wasn't an easy one to guide. Hence they paid me. What if the cops find out? Cops? Go, tell them. Go ahead. Bobby's friends supply stuff to me. I sell them. I get 10% commission. Go tell that too. Right from ECR to Ennore all the Police stations are bribed for this! All of them are well known to me. We have been doing this for ages now. You appear to me a very genuine and honest man. You don't need this. Oh yeah! Don't you threaten me. Because... I won't be playful always. We'll pay up if the cops confront us. But if an outsider, like you confronts... Get it? I am not here to confront you Babu Khan. I need to ask you something. Why are you following us? No! He is not following you. Following me. Not you. Like I said, not following you. Only me. - Why? - Why?! That was spontaneous. What do I answer? Why do you wanna mess with them? - Actually what happened was... - What? You know what... I put a Facebook image... and he didn't like it. So he..he...he came to see me. He is my wife's husband's brother's daughter. You and me are the same. Anna Nagar 8th block is the street name. Stop following us. Or you are dead. Indeed you Evil dead! Beware! Yeah! Shane Warne! Shane Warne! - Look at his 'Mango seed' like face! - What? Nothing you 'Mango seed' face! You tourist! You looked soft, which is why I threatened you with the gun. They would have just finished you off! You are here as a tourist and that is why I saved you. I don't know why you are here. But if you come here again... you will never return home! Babu Khan. The reason I came here... is this. Have you seen this kid anywhere? Someone... kidnapped her. I don't know. Why are you looking for her? - Leave! - Babu Khan! You care for me after knowing me for just two days. That girls is missing since past 2 months. Think about her mother's plight. Only after finding her, I will leave this place. Hey! Don't move! Vasanth? Remember me? What are you doing here? Hema booked me a room here. She said that you told the rooms were good here. Actually... I wanted to... ask you something. Won't you be coming for lunch tomorrow? I shall come. Super. Did you just arrive? Yes. Let's go? Shall we go inside? Ok. Please come. Nice room. Ok... Mr. Beard... shall we have some drink? Whiskey, Brandy or Beer? No. I don't drink. Oh! So what's this? Black tea? Fine. Shall we order dinner? Actually, I finished my dinner. Sir, dinner. Oh no! Ok. Take rest. You need it. Shall I take this? Sir? Hand the bill to him. - Hello? - Suresh here. I'm waiting for the photo. Can you come down? Yep. Right away. - Hello. - Sathya. - Was it you? - Yes. Now what's with the ad? Why did you publish it? Whose number is it? Don't you need the truth Swetha? Sathya! If Gautham finds out... then that's it! Swetha, I'm doing this for your kid. I'll be in a big trouble. Listen to me Swetha. I'm sure this will help us get some information. Something will turn up. You don't worry. We will find Riya for sure. We must find her! Trust me. Fine... did you go to the police station? I won't be able to go. - Gautham will be back today. - No Swetha... you go to the police station today itself. Update me whatever happens there. Ok. I'll go. Ganesh! Brother! Here is a breaking news. What happened? Hello? Sir... I saw you AD. You've mentioned the prize is 1 million. Old currencies or new ones? Look here! I'll pay only if you have valid information. What do you mean by information? Sorry, I got a call. What are you up to? Two minutes. - Hello. - Sir, I saw the newspaper AD. Can I talk to you about it? Speak only if you have any valid information. I'll pay you for sure. Sir, I don't want money. I just wanted to ask that why did you put up my daughter's pic in the ad? Can we meet? Where should I come? You tell me. I'll be there. Order a tea. Excuse me. 2 tea please. Look over there. Mr. Vasanth? Murthy? Were you the one who called? Yes sir. 6 months ago we had been on a trip to Shirdi. - Ok. - I lost my kid over there. I lodged a police complaint and searched everywhere. I thought I'll ask you, if you know anything about her. Do you know anything? Why aren't you there even in a single picture? I took these photos. If you need photos of me with her, I'll get them. Is Riya indeed your daughter? Yes sir. She is my daughter. Where did you get these photos? Get them? Sir! - Who gave it you? - Sir, its all... Stupid! - Sir! - Tell me who kidnapped Riya? - Sir, she is my daughter. - Tell me! Speak the truth! Sir, she is my daughter. Why are you beating me? This is not fair! I even have the birth certificate sir! Sir! Here is the birth certificate. Have a good look at it. This is the hospital discharge report. This is the FIR copy I filed in Shirdi. She is my daughter! - Hello? - Hello. This is Gautham. Swetha's husband. Are you the one who gave the ad in the newspaper? I want to meet you. - Can you come to my office? - Sir! Sir! You blind little f...! Fool! Give me a paper to wipe. It's him right? Yes. It's indeed him. Kerala police... is looking for the girl in Chennai? He is a police! We must be careful. Vasanth Menon. Sub inspector of Police. Trivandrum city. Do you know Chennai very well? Right from childhood... I was brought up here. Your commissioner... is my college senior. Jaysingh Mehra. Do you know him? Yeah. I know him. Yeah? Let me call him. Hello Gautham. How are you? Long time. I'm fine sir. How are you? I am too doing good. How's everyone at home? All are doing fine. Nice. Ok. - Sir... - Tell me. do you know Vasanth Menon? - Vasanth? - S.I, Trivandrum city. Oh! Vasanth Menon? He is on leave. He is in Chennai to attend a wedding. - Ok. - Hey Gautham, what's up man? Would you like to talk to him? Is he there? Oh yes. Why not? Hello. Sir, the minister is waiting on the call. Ok Gautham... I'll call you later. Looks like he is got an important meeting to attend. He hung up. How do you know Swetha? We met in a restaurant. That's when she mentioned that your daughter was kidnapped. So.. I thought, let me help. Wasn't it you who spoke to Mr. Srinivasan in my apartment. Swetha said that the investigation was closed. So... I was just trying my luck with your neighbors for some information. As soon I came to know about the newspaper ad... I flew down to India, Mr. Vasanth. I don't know how to explain this to you. We... don't have a kid. What?! Yes. We don't have a daughter. Two months ago... on 11th June... when Swetha was driving car... I called her up. She halted by the road side and spoke to me. That's when suddenly someone... attacked her and... stole the car. She was in coma for seven days. Actually, it was on the same day morning we had that conversation. That if we had a baby... it would have been nice. I wanted a boy. She wanted a girl. May be... it's all in the mind. When she came back to her senses from coma... she started asking "Where is my daughter?" She repeatedly kept asking. It's all her imagination. Doctors said that she was in trauma. Swetha, please! We don't have any child. - We have a daughter Gautham! - Open the door. No! We don't Swetha! We don't have any child. Please open the door. Police doubted me initially. How can I give information when nothing exist? It took a month's time for them to understand the reality. Only then they realized that all they were searching for is her imagination. How I do I bring this child if it doesn't exist at all? Last week... she pointed out to some other photo and started saying that was her child. Mr. Vasanth... it is said that never believe until the eye meets the reality. But a few... believe what their mind has to tell them. Even if it is a lie... they just can't accept it. So, I don't know how to tell you. We don't have a daughter. So is it all an imagination? You mean its all her imagination? You spoke to her. What do you think? Do you think she is normal? Hey! How's your health? Ok. Thanks. Mr. Vasanth. Do not give ads in paper and... make our lives... - even more complicated. Please. - Sorry. Riya's photos are nowhere to be found. Not in your phone, facebook or in your house. When I asked about Bobby, you threw me out. You got scared seeing the ad in the paper. Even when I asked what Gautham did about it, you didn't answer. The information you gave was false... which is why the police closed the case. Swetha, no one has ever seen Riya! The school principal hasn't seen her. Gautham... says there is no such girl! I didn't even see her in the CCTV footage! She... was hiding in the back seat of the car. I... saw it with my eyes. She... was scared! Swetha, they were there to steal the car. Not to kidnap your daughter! Believe me Sathya! Please. How can I? You showed me a photo and said she is your daughter. Another person shows me the same photo saying that's his daughter and shows me the birth certificate. He has all the proof. Whom do I believe? All of them... are lying Sathya! So did you tell me the truth? Didn't I ask you for Bobby's statement? Why didn't you to the police station on the same day? I did go! But none of them are ready to believe that I have a daughter! Not even Gautham! Why didn't you tell me all this earlier? Because I was scared. After 4 years... if I call up and say that I have a daughter... no one is ready to believe. Everyone believes I am retard that's why I told you. What if you didn't believe me? - Hence I was scared. - Swetha... please. Just once, for my sake... just close your eyes and think. Tell me if you recollect anything. Please. I have a daughter! So you too don't believe me? Swetha... Leave me alone. Swetha, listen to me. Leave me alone please! Does she really have a daughter? Sathya... Swetha, what are all these height markings? I thought you will believe me. Swetha. Swetha! No. Swetha! Hi Sathya. I need your help. So you too don't believe me? Sir! - Is it him? - Yes sir. Look here boss. Basically, I am a little short tempered. I am a bit violent too. - Isn't it Reddy? - Yes sir. If you irritate me unnecessarily... I'll rip you apart. So just answer my question. Why did your wife... commit suicide? Enough. Enough. If you drink too much of water then you might excuse yourself wanting to pee. - What's the time Reddy? - 3:10 sir. Saw that? He answered me right away. What's your problem? One slap and... your jaws will be displaced. Answer me now. Where were you when your wife committed suicide? I was in Dubai. - Reddy. - Sir. Get me all the flight timings from Dubai. Ok sir. What's the nature of your work in Dubai? We have our main office there. Oh! - Reddy. - Sir... the main is over there. Fine. Who else comes here when you are away? No one. Reddy, noted it down? - Yes sir. - So you are lying? Just now the security said that your brother visits often. Sir... so what if my brother visits? Oh yeah. What's wrong if his brother visits? I asked, if he had visited today? You don't know? - Reddy. - Sir. Reddy! Reddy! It's him! Yes sir. - It's indeed him. - Yes sir. He pushed her down! You know what? Let me call my lawyer. It's getting hot in here. Shall I switch on the fan? Hang up! I said hang up the call. Keep your mobile down! Who is your lawyer? I'll arrest him as well as you, shoot both of you down and turn the case in to an encounter. Give me that file. Here. Sign it. Keep your phone switched on all the time. Never switch it off. You must come to station whenever summoned. Never ever give any lame excuses. If I find out that you had pushed her... Reddy! He will push down the exact same way. Let's go. You may drink the water now. Sir... this the mobile of the deceased girl. - This is the last dialed number. - Ok sir. - Trace that number and inform Reddy. - Ok sir. Unavailable to take call right now. What's wrong Reddy? Why aren't they picking to call? Sir! - What's this? - The information about the number. Its in the name of a person named Sathya. It's a new SIM card. He has provided his alternate number and an address too. Sir, do you think the address would be correct? What do you think? - You went to find it out. Right? - Yes sir. - Shouldn't you have investigated thoroughly? - Sir! - Aren't you too a police? - Sir. Sir. - Sir. - Hey... - Hey Reddy! - Sorry sir. Now, what did I say that made you weep? Sorry sir. - Acting? - No sir. You are well trained in it! Wipe off the tears and continue your work. Now come on. Move. - Hello? - Greeting madam. - Can I speak to Mr. Sathya? - And you are? We are calling from the mobile service company. He has won an offer. If you give us the address, we shall come deliver it. Sorry, not interested. Madam, let me tell the offer then you may decide. 3 costly Silk Sarees... and 2 gold chains as gift. For the ladies in the house... we will gift 2 sets of gold girdle. We will give you a coupon and you just have to fill it. She is giving it a thought, Reddy! "No. 6, Riverview road, Kotturpuram, Chennai - 85." Thank you madam. Got the address. - Reddy. - Sir? Give an offer and any women will blurt out their address. - Indeed sir. - Come on. In Besant Nagar, a married woman residing in an apartment building... slipped off the 12th floor. The residents living there are shocked by the incident. The police is still investigating if this is a murder or suicide. It is said that the answers given by the husband of the deceased shocked the police. He said that his wife was mentally unstable for past few months and... she was undergoing a treatment for it. Greetings sir. Babu Khan... I'll pay you later. May I come in? Tell me. Once in every two year I visit Hajj. I've never felt any difference between religions. But... no god forgives if one has sinned. I've done many mistakes... like smuggling drugs etc. But I was never responsible for anyone's death. Just because I hid a truth from you... I never expected it will lead to a death. Why are you telling me all these? Remember you showed me a photo the other day? If I had told you the truth back them... then Swetha madam would have been alive today! How do you know Swetha? Apart from that... I know many more stuffs. I swear on Allah. I'm not hiding any truth. I did see that child the other day. I saw. Greetings brother. Call me after you deliver it at the Chittor border. Ok. Your money. What do you want us to do with the girl now. I asked you to come at 2 O' clock! You are early. Go! Take her inside. That's when I saw her. Brother... the kid? Don't you open your mouth about this! Poor Swetha madam. Many a time... she kept visiting the police station. My friend told me. Daughter's lost. The police too didn't help. Gautham lied. So many have betrayed her! Everyone looked at her as if she was a retard! Damn it! Even I didn't believe her. Why didn't you say it the other day? I was afraid of getting killed. Then why say it today? A life is lost because of me. So Riya... - is alive? - I don't know sir. I never saw her after. But... Bobby knows. Whom are you calling? Bobby. Switched off! Sir... I know where we can find Bobby. We must nab him at any cost. We must! Who is he? Vasanth Menon. They must have mistaken him for me and killed him. Before they find out who I am... we must find Bobby's hide out. Come on. Please come sir. Hello? You have murdered the wrong person! Hello, sister... Sathya the police are here at home. Didn't I message the other day itself that it was not him I met in the coffee shop? They are inquiring about you. Me? Is this how you execute your plan? They are talking about some suicide or murder. Something like that. - Hang up. I'll come. - I'll come there. Come on. Move! Police has reached Ram's sister, Hema's house. What are you saying? I'm sure there is something big in this issue. Everyone's... trying to hide some truth! Without Bobby we can't get any lead. Babu Khan... please nab Bobby for me. Please. Ok sir. What are you doing here? I came to tell you a secret. What? I know who killed your brother. Stay inside. Get out of here before I kill you. Bobby. What? Bobby killed your brother. Tell me, I'm at Kotturpuram. Yes. What happened? Are you Sathya? Hmm. Reddy do you have a matchbox? I've got lighter. Before committing suicide Swetha had called you up. Why? Your SIM card's address proof is this but... you are staying in a hotel. Hello! I am asking you! Why did she call you repeatedly? Are you her boyfriend? Secret one or... you guys are open about it? Does Gautham know this? How is that you maintain things without getting caught? - Reddy. - Sir? Why aren't we so lucky? We can but not with such a serious face. - Yes sir. - We must look like him. There are 2 types in this. One is either be a reacher or... be a settler with whatever comes. So what are you? Reacher or a settler? Hello. Did you guys...? Sathya! Look here! In order to wrap up this case... don't you talk rubbish about her. So... you know what I need? - Reddy! - Sir. Reddy! Reddy! Reddy! It's him. It's indeed him! Come on. Let's continue this discussion at the police station. Take your hands off! Is Bobby there inside? Why is Babu Khan here? Bobby wants him to come. Come. Hey! Police! Police! Police! I told you not to see me here. I'm hiding. And... what the... Babu Khan doing here? Why did you kill my brother? What?! Why did you kill Olha? What are you talking about? Hey! What the hell? I just told him a teeny tiny lie. He fell for it. When I look at you now... I feel like bursting out with laughter. But I won't laugh. Do you know why? If I laugh, he will find out that I was lying. He is lying. This guy is lying man! - Don't believe him. - No! I am not lying. See, I tell the truth and he stares me like an angry bird! He is very emotional about his brother! That sentiment is what made him fell for my lie. He won't rest until he takes revenge on you. You game is over. It's your game that is going to get over. - Wait and watch. - See? He killed you brother in a brutal way. He is lying man! This guy is lying man! No! Murdered him brutally, like in a Tarantino movie! I didn't kill you brother. My brother died badly? You die worse! - Don't shoot. - Please don't shoot! - I didn't kill you brother. Calm down. - Beat him but don't shoot! I didn't kill your brother. Listen! I didn't do that! I didn't do that! If allowed you would've finished me off too. How dare you?! Why did Swetha call you? Madam, looks like he won't reply. How about shock treatment? That machine has been idle for long. Chowdhary! Where are you from? Why are you staying in a hotel. What's the link between you and Swetha? Fourth... What was the fourth question Reddy? Well, when she slipped off... Where were you when Swetha slipped of the balcony? When her daughter was kidnapped... where were you? Nearby. I was having a frozen yoghurt. It was bit sour but still it tasted good. I am the one suppose to ask questions. You just give me the answers! Why do you keep repeating that her daughter has been kidnapped? She was mentally unstable. Reports claim that she is mentally unstable. Are you sure that she was mentally unstable? Did you witness? Have you met her in person? So, in order to act this way... how much bribe did you accept? Phew! - Reddy. - Sir... Why does he keep standing up? If he sits, he would still be taller. Looks like he wants to exhibit his height! Tell him that I hate such activities. Sorry sir. Why did you apologize now? Do you want to hit? Hit me. - Hey! - Chowdhary! Sorry. They are testing your patience. This is an investigation method to bring the truth out. He is like that. We are trying our best to find the reason behind Swetha's death. We need your help. It's been 2 months since that kid went missing. And why are you suddenly bothered now? It's been a month since that case is closed. There is no proof that there is such a girl. And Swetha had some issues. So he bought you out too? How much did he pay you? 10 million? - I mean Gautham! - Sathya... you are being emotional. I am talking about the reality. Investigation took place as planned. But there is no proof that she has such a daughter. The girl is true. What if I prove it? It's stinking! He is alive! - He is alive Reddy. - Ok sir. Who is he? Bobby. Gautham's brother. As of now, Riya's whereabouts... is only known to him. We can't arrest him without any evidence. This is the drug he smuggles. Only a little is here. Rest is running in his body. Is this evidence enough? Or do you want a selfie of him with the drugs? Let's arrest him. (7.4.18) Can he see us? Blank. If you are blank, find and let me know. I mean, he can't see anything but blank from inside. Because he won't say the truth if he sees us. He is a bit dangerous too. Where is Riya? She is not here. Did you check your pockets? Intoxicated mongrel! Tell me, where is the child? - Give me a joint and I'll tell you. - Oh! Demanding drugs to a cop? Rest assured, you'll get it. Look here. If you answer me... I'll give you the required protection. I'll ensure your safety. Tell me where is Riya? I'll tell the truth. - Good. - I'll tell you Tell me. Touch any one of them. Please sir. - He is thrashing him! - Allow us to do our duty! How dare you mock a police officer? You can merely mock at me. I can mock at you... as well as I can finish you off in anger! Chowdhary! - No madam! - Ask him now. Please take the gun away. - Tell us the truth. - Don't shoot. - Don't shoot. - Where is Riya? Please, move this gun away. - Please. - Speak! Don't shoot. This won't workout madam. Let's try the shock treatment. Chowdhary will you shut up? Madam, do not move. Stand still. Bobby. - Sir! No! - He is having a gun! - Sir! Leave me! - Sir! Even without pressing charges on me... Listen to me. Are you guys trying to finish me off? No! Bobby. No! Damn! - Listen! - No! - Leave me please! - Put the gun down! No! Bobby listen to me! Put the gun down. No! Listen to her Bobby. I won't do anything. - Place the gun down. - Damn! No! Bobby! You better listen! Sir no! Anything could happen inside. If you guys don't let me out... I'll shoot all of you. Bobby. Listen Bobby. You are committing a blunder. - Put the gun down. - Don't do anything crazy. Calm down. Madam! Madam, are you ok? Madam, let's go to a hospital. We have already informed. Don't worry. The bullet just brushed me. Well... the wound looks serious madam. Chowdhary... stop worrying. This ain't a lock up death. It was an act of self defense. We have got evidence. Send the body for autopsy. Yes ma'am. Sathya. Swetha's death is still a mystery. The reason why Bobby was hiding too is still a mystery. Even Gautham's statements cannot be trusted. In fact even Riya is a mystery. But one thing is for sure... if all our actions turn out to be sin... then I won't even forgive myself. Sathya. I need to talk to you. In person. I'll be at my shop sir. See you there. See you madam. Are you ok? Yeah. Are you ok? No. Drink? Ok. So... in a failed quest to find her daughter... Swetha committed suicide. Isn't it? None of you care about it. My husband. Two years ago... we met with a small accident on our anniversary. He died on the spot. Sit. I do care. But to fly down from abroad, stay in a hotel, and getting caught by the police. Nobody wishes for that. Do you love her? It's your life damn it! Sathya my dad! The absence of a loved one. I can very well understand that. He is dying slowly. It's his... death wish. Myself and Swetha worked together. I don't have the courage to refuse. Nor do I have the power to accept! Sathya, I don't have anyone else in this world other than my dad. We planned to get married. So, Gautham? I too don't have anyone else in this world except you Swetha. In two days I am getting married to Gautham. I have to go. Swetha! Please don't go. Good bye Sathya. Madam. - I'm done with the chores. - Fine. Shall I take leave? Raju. Excuse me. - Drop Lakshmi at her home. - Ok, madam. - Near Mandaveli station. - Ok madam. - You may leave. - Ok madam. Sorry. When Swetha asked me to help her find Riya... I couldn't refuse. But after investigating, everyone here has buried the truth! Bobby, the school principal and the Africans! In fact... even Gautham. The fact that I believed them all, that's what hurt Swetha the most. Just... for a imaginary kid Swetha wouldn't commit suicide. There is no need to do so. What's the proof that the girl exists. There are height markings of Riya in Swetha's house. Even when everyone hid the truth about Riya... Swetha was able to dig this out. Bobby abducted Riya! Now Bobby's dead! Can you do me a favor? The only person who know about Riya now is Gautham. I can find Gautham... but... I can't trace out Riya's location. My target... is not Gautham. It's Riya! Can you... arrest Gautham? It's impossible to arrest someone on the basis of doubt. Strong evidence is required. This must be dealt very carefully. Give me few days time. I'll take care of it. I don't know why you asked me to meet in person. But one thing. Even after being in coma for 2 months... if she can remember me, with whom she broke up 4 years ago... then how can she forget her kid, who was kidnapped just 2 months before? See you madam. Speak! Who else knows apart from Sathya? Answer us! Speak! Go check who is it. Sathya. Babu Khan. I thought I would have to go all the way to your hotel to catch you. I had 100% kill record and you... destroyed it! Babu Khan! Babu Khan! Babu Khan, get up! Babu Khan! Come, let's take you to the hospital. Babu Khan! Don't give up Babu Khan! Babu Khan? Babu Khan? Babu Khan! Sorry. There is no proof that such a girl exists. Swetha was able to dig this out. The police were here. We don't have a daughter. Vasanth Menon. I did see the kid the other day. Now Bobby is dead! - Sir, where are you headed to? - I want to meet ACP. She has gone out. - To where? - No idea. Everyday she steps out at this hour to somewhere. Drop Lakshmi at her home. Nearby Mandaveli station. Sir, do you know where ACP's maid servant Lakshmi resides? I don't know. Do you know Lakshmi? I don't know sir. - I don't know. - I don't know. I don't know. - I don't know. - I don't know. - No. - I don't know. This address? I've no idea. I don't know. Why are you disturbing at this odd hour. Sorry. - I know no one with that name. - I don't know. Try the next street. Sir do you know where Lakshmi resides? - The maid who works at a police officer's house? - Yes. That corner house. You can find her there. That one? Where is ACP? - The address? - Mahabalipuram. In the EC Road. Come on Chowdhary, pick up! Pick up! She is my daughter! Not that way! Drop the gun Sathya. Drop it. Put it down now! Move! What did you do to Riya? Where is Riya? Don't shout. She is asleep. You might wake her up. So I hope you understood everything. Riya is with me. Will be with me! Forever. As my daughter. You are committing a blunder ACP! There is nothing right or wrong Sathya. I like Riya. I'll raise her. Gautham didn't like her... - he tried to kill her. - What?! You don't know right? What happened was a kidnap. Not a car robbery. The money was in the trunk. The child was in the car. The plan was to kidnap her and finish her off. Wondering how I know all about it? I'll get it ready for you by 6. I'm on my way. I finished early. You are two hours early. Is that a problem? You have three days time. Let me know once you are done. - And don't forget... - Ok. I've your passports. What was that? Nothing. Nothing. Mom! She hugged me and addressed me as 'Mom.' That's when I realized that the kid is... Riya. No! No! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Remember, I told you that my husband died in an accident? He was not the only one to die that day. I was seven months pregnant. Even my kid died. Fate. I was left with no happiness at all. Rithvi? Renu? Reshma? Riya? But look... the moment I held Riya, she hugged me and called out 'Mom.' Mom! Unexpected. Just when I thought that I would never be a mother... a child called out to me as 'Mom.' When those words fell in my ears... I couldn't imagine giving up Riya. That's when I made up my mind. That Riya will be with me here after. I'll go to any extent for Riya. I'll kill any one! Riya is my child hereafter. Your child? Did you give birth to her? I saved her! But at the cost of Swetha's life! So? Poor woman, she is coma... and she is desperate to find her child. Do you expect to me sympathize? When you can never understand a mother's pain... then how can you be a good mother to her? You can't bend the truth ACP! It can be hidden. In fact... it can be erased. Brother! What is your demand? I want Riya! Gautham helped me. First, he erased off every thing related to Riya without even a trace. Fool! He forgot the height marks. He bribed the school principal. To all his friends, family and neighbors, he narrated a story I scripted. - He earned their trust. - Swetha is in coma. When she regains her conscious... and finds out Riya is no more... she won't be able to handle it. So I've planned to do something. Even doctors and police... say that this is for the best. I am going to tell her that we never had a daughter. - I think this is not a good idea. - I think this is not a good idea. - Gautam. - Do you have a better idea? Please tell me. Whatever, you must appreciate my plan Sathya. More than killing someone... it is very difficult to erase off their identity. Finishing of foreigners... will cost a bit more. I finished of the Nigerians. I erased off the CCTV footage from the house opposite to the school. Then the FIR... - Close this investigation. - Ok ma'am. Time waste. I finished off every obstacle that came my way. I did it very carefully. Take the gun. In a systematic manner. I did everything I felt was necessary for myself. Clean sweep. Actually, when Swetha was in coma... I wanted to kill her. But Gautham wanted her to live. Where is Riya? Who is Riya? Who is it Swetha? Gautham, where is Riya?! Where is Riya? He wanted to her to die every second as she continued to live. There must be a doll here. We had hanged Riya's photos all over here. This was Riya's photo. Where is Riya? What are you blabbering? Our daughter... - She used to play right here. - Where? - Our daughter! Riya! - No Swetha. - We don't have a daughter. - Where is my daughter? She turned retard in pursuit of her child. - No we didn't see any such kid. - Do you have a child madam? She used to play with them. Stop searching for a daughter that doesn't exist. It's embarrassing. Am I the one lying? I do have a daughter! You don't need police. A psychiatrist. Please do go for a checkup. The way she suffered and how long she used to cry, Gautham keeps me posted everyday and enjoys it. Sadist! He is not the sadist. It's you. Won't you just settle down? Even as the death stares, you keep finding faults? Don't shout! She is asleep. You might wake her up. Now what? Why are you panicking? Afraid! Aren't you? Do you know what's your weakness? You realize what you've done is a mistake. Check it out... I just asked you one question... and you just provided all the necessary evidences. I am not afraid anymore Sathya. You are my last sacrifice. Gau... - What is it? - Gau... Gautham... why did he want to kill Riya? Because Riya isn't Gautham's daughter. Good bye Sathya. Sathya! Sathya! Sathya! Sathya, look here. 14 years imprisonment guaranteed. But I striving hard to get you hanged. How could you even think about murdering a 3 year old? How cheap?! How could you be so cruel? Gautham... Swetha's reports are clear. But... it's your reports that are... - Sorry sir. You are impotent. - What? Forget about having a second child, Gautham. You will never be able to father a child. What? I already have a daughter. - She is sitting there outside. - She can't be your child Gautham. Riya isn't my daughter. She was born to some other guy and Swetha! Do you know why did Swetha want you to look for Riya? If not you then who else can I ask? Riya. Sathya! Sathya where are you going? Sathya wait. Good bye Sathya. Swetha. Please don't leave me Swetha. Please don't leave me Swetha. Please! I love you. Are you ready to meet? She is my daughter. Go. We plan something... but... fate guides us by our hand, towards a different direction. What happens when? Why it happens? Nobody has the answer. She called me. Why did she call? I came here without knowing why she called me. In this world where I am lonely, she has left me a relationship. I couldn't believe my eyes! Who are you? In such a big city... I found my own child.
