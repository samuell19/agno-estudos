Many people believe that when we are born, we each fall under one of the twelve zodiac signs and that the signs can tell a lot about our personality traits. The air signs Aquarius, Gemini, and Libra are people with creative minds and dreaming souls. The earth signs Capricorn, Taurus, and Virgo are disciplined and hard-working people. The water signs Pisces, Cancer, and Scorpio are very thoughtful and sensitive. The fire signs Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius are dynamic and love to conquer. Bearing similar traits, signs of the same element are highly compatible. For example, Sagittarius and Leo would make a perfect couple. They love passionately, like to share intimate moments and long for new experiences. Pisces and Cancer would be very romantic together. For them, happiness simply means being together and enjoying peaceful moments. So, find yourself someone of the same element to fall in love with. "Live happily ever after" guaranteed! Sorry... Hello? Go get some coffee. I have to take a call. Come with me. Come on, be good. Hey, what's up? OK. I got it. Is everything OK? I have a meeting now. I should go home then. Do you need a ride? I can't. I'm busy. Fine, busy dating. So what? All right, all right, I'm heading there. Here's the coffee! OK, give it to me. - Babe. - Yes? Go home by yourself. I'm busy. What? The weather's nice today. I'll walk home. Are you sure? Are you kidding me? Huy! Huy! Stop! Hi, boss! Hello! What are you doing during office hours? I'm studying facial expressions for my drawings. OK then. Let me see. - What expression is that? - It's "love at first sight". - Love at first sight? - Yes. Really? It looks kind of dumb to me. Have you ever been in love? Not yet. I knew it. Ninety. Ninety-one. Ninety-two. Hi, boss. What are you doing? I'm lifting weights. These days, chicks love guys with six packs and a handsome face. You know what? Chicks love this, not this. Hand it over. Focus on drawing. He finished it all, so leave him be. Another sleepless night? You have panda eyes. If I slept, you wouldn't have time to go hang out. Hey! Everyone has their job. I am busy too. I'm really hustling to find clients for our comic books. Besides, I can't draw. I would be worthless here anyway. Whatever. No excuses. Here. Read it and give me your feedback. Hurry up! Let me see... A nice, shy boy wins the heart of the female protagonist. Nonsense. Why? Really, guys? Sit down. Let me remind you... of a story from your past. Remember your crush from the student council? You liked her for three years, but you never dared to tell her. Oh jeez! You are so lame! Stop creating unrealistic stories. There is no way passive men can pick up hot chicks! All of you don't know anything about love either. Killing dragons, saving princesses, fighting monsters. Those skills seem useful, but you need to know about love and need to know how to flirt. OK, master. Tell us how. It's easy. We should create a "bad boy" character. He's hot, he's gallant, and he knows how to sweet talk. He has a killer smile, just like me. And last but not least, he's confident. -But above all, -Oh gosh... we need to build "a flirting strategy" for him. What? What do you mean a flirting strategy? He sounds like a bad guy. My oh my! It's hard to be sincere with someone you've just met. Love at first sight is just a fairy tale. Trust me. Guys with good looks and good flirting skills cannot fail! Why are you here alone? Where are your classmates? There was a power cut, so they left. But we had already finished everything anyway. Let me show you. It's night-time out there and daytime in here. Yeah... We painted your door. We painted part of Chi's, too. It took us all morning. What do you think? It looks nice. But I think Chi will be upset. Well, she's like Cinderella, never getting home before midnight. Her opinion doesn't count. Come on, it's her job. Have you seen her latest shoot? It's stunning. Yeah it is, but you don't have to praise her so much. By the way... How's it going with Nam? Did he enjoy the food I showed you? He seemed just normal, like usual. I don't really feel like we're connected. Pisces and Cancer are both Water signs, so you two must be very compatible. You two are made for each other. You just need to believe in it. Besides love, a man has to focus on his career. So go easy on him and trust in your future, OK? I got it. For now, focus more on yourself. Work on your thesis. Show me! Yes, "Mom". Guys, this is my latest sketch of the Little Mermaid. - Why are her boobs so big? - What? She's gonna fall flat on her face. Hey! It was your idea. You told us that only raunchy comedy and hot manga can become bestsellers! Don't you remember? I really said that? - Did he? - Yeah, he did. But that idea's so popular. We have to think differently. Change it again? We'll make changes to the main character. Let this one... be Snow White! Let her be sexier than ever before. The Little Mermaid must be something else. She doesn't have to show too much skin, but she still looks cool. She has curly hair and wears big headphones. - And... - What the hell? What headphones? Yes, we're modernizing fairy tale characters. We'll bring them into the present, right? The Little Mermaid loves music, right guys? But without a sexy swimsuit, what makes her a mermaid? Besides, how can she wear headphones underwater? Huy, this is an important project. Your ideas are so risky. Calm down, my good friend. We can't tell whether it's risky or not. Let's give it a try. I want to create a type of girl who people feel peaceful to be with. She's fresh and unique. I can tell you she's gonna become the next symbol of love. Where did you get that idea from? Your new chick? Nope, I just observed and created it. Mark my words. No more changes! I promise! But give her a unique pair of headphones, OK? My! From now on, I'll put the house chores list here, OK? That's nice. Hey! I was away for one night, but you two already messed up this place! Look inside and outside! Gross! This is my class's art project. And I find it pretty. But I find it gross. You're not the only one living here, OK? You should have asked beforehand. I did, of course. And My, the owner, said yes. Fine. Do whatever you want but leave my room alone. OK? By the way, are you heading out? I'm out to draw. Good choice! Pisces should go out today. There'll be lots of surprises. What about Virgo? And Leo? Both Leo and Virgo should not go out today. But next week, there'll be a pleasant surprise in Virgo's love life. Everything with you is about zodiac signs! Do you really think that those things will help you find love? Well, believe or not, these are scientifically and astrologically proven. I find them quite accurate. Just a bunch of theories. The point is, do you two have boyfriends yet? Well, you can see, My's dating Nam. And me, I'm single because I don't like anyone, not because no one likes me. Congrats! Keep that mindset and stay single for your whole life. Whatever. And I think you should stay away from Nam. What's wrong with him? You call that love? You two don't even hold hands or kiss. But I think he is... Yes? No! How come you left me on the street like that? Apologize first, then we can talk. Bye! See? When it comes to love, you have to be proactive and be in control. You can't just wait for it to come your way. Got it? Fine, let's see who will call first. Why didn't you call me? I've been busy lately. So how about dinner tonight? Sounds good. I'm... Baby? Hello? I'm busy now! SOPHISTICATED MUSIC LOVER BOHEMIAN STYLE FINE ARTS FASHION STUDENT Are you all right? Hey mister, are you OK? Luckily, I am fine, but my coffee... I'm sorry! Just "I'm sorry"? But it was... It was just an accident, I know. But you gotta be responsible for it. Not only to me, but also to the farmers who grew this coffee, to the drivers who delivered it over hundreds of miles and to the baristas who diligently make coffee every day. - And... - Please, stop! I got it. I'll buy you another one. Hey! Hold on. What now? I don't want it anymore. I'll have it tomorrow instead. This is my phone number. Call me, or else I'll go to your school to find you. Got it, Hoang My? HOANG MY, FASHION DEPARTMENT COLLEGE OF CULTURAL STUDIES OK, now I gotta go. Remember to call me! Hey! Hold on. When's your birthday? Ha! You want to know more about me already? Just tell me. December 5th. December 5th... So you're a Sagittarius. - Sagittarius? - That's right. Sagittarius guys are heartless, childish, irresponsible, lazy, and ignorant. What the hell are you saying? By the way, I'm a Pisces. Sagittarius and Pisces are the least compatible. Together, they make trouble! See? We just met, but we already "caused damage to the coffee industry", didn't we? You're being ridiculous. Do some research, then you'll believe me. You're silly. Take this money and go buy some coffee. This is for you and all the farmers, drivers, and baristas. Thank you for trying so hard to ask me out for a coffee date. However, people with incompatible signs should stay a safe distance apart. OK, I gotta go. Sagittarius are lovely, sociable, charming gentlemen. They are intuitive, intelligent, and love to explore. However, they are quite childish, self-centered, selfish and heartless. Nonsense. Pisces are the most sensitive among all the twelve zodiac signs. They're mysterious and attractive, and they prefer love over materialistic things. However, they're indecisive and moody. You need patience to be with them. Basically, being a pretty boy is already an advantage when it comes to flirting. There are three types of girls. First, simple girls. They are attracted to hot guys. A killer smile is all it takes to win their hearts. Easy! Second, bossy girls who always try to act cool. Pretend to ignore her, and she'll chase you back. Finally, girls with unique personalities. They are high-hanging fruits! You have to observe them, analyze what you see, then build a proper strategy. For example, to win Pisces girls, follow these five steps. Step one, play cat and mouse. Keep following her to make her remember you. Why are you coming here? Ah! Is it about the money I gave you? Well, just keep the change. I'm here to prove that Sagittarius is unlike what you think. It's scientifically proven. I told you. Now I can see that Sagittarius are really careless, shallow, and stubborn. Fine, I am stubborn, I agree. But about "careless" and "shallow", I'll prove you wrong. How? By caring for you. Stop fooling around. All right. Pick one, please. What's this for? Let me know more about you, so I can take care of you. Or are you afraid you might be wrong about me? If you're confident, give me a chance. OK. Thanks to My, we got free drinks today! All right, thank you. I'm leaving now. Han, I have class now. Hey! Make dinner with me later! Yes, "Mom". Bye-bye! You can leave now but remember to submit the student club reports to me by this weekend. - OK. - Bye-bye. Han! I need your help. THE LITTLE MERMAID CHI STYLIST CALLING Someone's still upset. You know that and yet you still haven't called? No. I'm the one who's upset. You are upset? How come? You ignored me last night. - How dare you... - Stop being like that. I don't like it, OK? I'm hungry. I don't want to argue with you now. Have dinner with me. Please! Up till now, I still don't know where you live. I'll let you know when it feels right. When? During the weekend? Not sure which weekend though. You're always like this. Forget it. Now that we finished eating, where should we go next? Are you gonna let me go home by myself again? Of course not. I booked you a car. Who's that? Don't study too hard, My. Take care of yourself. I'm sure it's from Nam. He's so romantic. He bought all my favorite food! Our favorite. Han, did you give Sagittarius my number? Sagittarius who? The guy from this afternoon. You two looked close, so when he asked, I... I'm sorry, I didn't mean it. You gave him our address, too? DID PISCES RECEIVE FOOD FROM SAGITTARIUS? I'm doomed. I gave him my number, too. Hello? Are you trying to ignore my texts? Your house was so easy to find. It looks like a kindergarten. So what? I like it. All right. Try to finish all the food. Take care of yourself. I'm about to get sick. What? You are sick? Have you seen the doctor? No need. Obviously, I'm have a heart attack because it's late, and someone is stalking me. I want to take care of you. But you don't want to see me. So, I had no other choice. That's totally unnecessary! That's nothing. By the way, tomorrow I'll take the heart attack patient to school. Try to sleep early tonight. Bye! Hey! What now? What else is there to do? Just eat it. I'm starving. Who said "no" before? "No" to him, not to the food. He must think you eat a lot. No way. Chi, you're back. We have lots of food. Or whatever. Is something wrong? I'll go check on her. Ignore her. Hey, what if Sagittarius insists on picking you up tomorrow? Hey! Are you really gonna walk to school? You can follow me if you want. I don't mind. OK, I'll be your bodyguard. You seem to have so much free time. I wonder what you do for work. It has to do with comic books. Comic books? Yes, I make comic books. My job and your major have a lot in common. What else do they have in common besides drawing? A lot more! For example, I bet we're both going to enjoy this show. These tickets are precious! How did you get them? So, do you want to go? Are these for me? Yes, one is for you, the other is for me. Do I have to go with you? I wanna go with Han... You know these tickets are not easy to find. You can't just count me out. You can stay home with Han and regret it, or you can go to the show with me. Fine. If you go with me this time, I'll stop following you around then. OK? OK. Take my ticket. Keep it for me, please. Now have fun at school. I'll bring you food again! Step two: Go missing. Used to being chased, the prey will wonder why the hunter disappears. Chi will be surprised when she sees these tickets! Magazine stylists aren't the only ones who can get these tickets. I think we should return them. It doesn't feel right. THE LITTLE MERMAID Stop it! Focus on the game! - But it's your turn. - OK. Show me your moves. WEDNESDAY Come on! OK. This is my favorite character. I find her somehow... You can comment and make changes to other characters but definitely not to this one. THURSDAY Dude, why are you so aggressive? - Chi, Chi! - What? Can I ask you something? FRIDAY Ask me what? Which design is better? Between these two... I pick this one. It'll be a super cool design if you use the right material. You're getting better. Great job! I've finished the designs for every zodiac sign, except Sagittarius. What do you think? - Sagittarius? - Yes. People born in June? What a pain! As long as the outfits are fashionable, who cares about signs? But that's the whole theme... WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I MISS YOU. I'M WATCHING A MOVIE. THE LITTLE MERMAID DID YOU GET MY FOOD? WHY DIDN'T YOU REPLY? I'M TAKING YOU TO SCHOOL TOMORROW. SATURDAY SUNDAY Hey, the show's tonight, but Sagittarius hasn't called you yet. Can I go with you then? But I promised to go with him. Then call and ask him. Go ahead! This looks quite short. Make it longer. What was that? Let's call it a day. I'm in a good mood. I'll buy you drinks! He didn't pick up. Now what? But are you ready to go to it? Of course. I've prepared everything. Ta-da! Wait for me to put this on. But I said yes just now. Girls! Look at what I have here. Chi! Chi! What? The royal ball is not just for Cinderella. Is she OK? Cheers! Our project is going well so far. What is taking you so long? We're gonna be late. Just call a cab first. We're coming! Princesses, please be ready for the royal ball! What's so fun about night clubs? Chi goes there so often. It's work-related. She has to socialize with her co-workers. Huy! What's wrong? Huy! Huy! Are you all right? Hello, girls! Back from the show? With my tickets, right? Did you enjoy it? He smells like alcohol. My! I'm sorry. I'm sorry for not going with you. I'm sorry for not calling you. I... - I'm sorry! - Hey! I'll get you a cab, OK? Can I have some water? Whatever. Here's your water. Thank you. Why did you disappear for days and now turn up like this? The truth is... Work has been overwhelming recently. Today, I went out for a drink. Somehow, I arrived here. It must be because I've been thinking about you a lot. I think... I've fallen for you. I'm sorry. Can I have some ginger tea? Wait here for me. If you go into my house, I'll smash your face in with this pan, got it? Step three: Sneak attack. Catch her off guard, appear vulnerable to evoke her sympathy. It's bad to get drunk, but drunken words are somehow more convincing. Hey! Wake up! Just ignore him. Let's go inside. We can't leave him here. Should we tie him up? If you're afraid, take this pan to bed! Whatever. Is he still awake? I don't think so. He's asleep. We should go to bed, too. I'm always there whenever you need me! But you're never there for me! I'm so pissed off... I'm heading home. Bye, everyone. Home sweet home. Turn the music on! Let's party! Who's that? Is that you, My? Is that you, Han? Who's that? Chi! You're back. My! Hey. What? Who's in our house? My friend. He's drunk, like you. Your boyfriend? Then I should say hi. You're gonna wake Han up. I'm glad you got a boyfriend. As long as he loves you and cares for you, you shouldn't let him go. Life... is about the choices you make. You gotta step up. Got it? Yes, "Mom". Good girl! I love you so much! Please go to bed, "Mom". OK. Bye-bye! My, I'm late. Help me clean my room, please! Are you gonna have breakfast? No, I can't! Huy! Wake up! It's morning now. Huy! Wake up! Huy! Is that you, My? Why am I here? Don't you remember last night? Step four: play dumb. Make her think that she knows your hidden secret. That's how a hunter wins his prey's trust. STEP FOUR: TRAPPING Did I do anything bad? My friends would kill you if you did. But... I remember saying something. No. You didn't. You just asked for some water and then fell asleep. I remember. Last night, I... left my car at the bar! Wait! - I gotta go. - Huy! Did Han do this? No, I did. Just in case... How's it going? Are you still with my baby? I am. Hey. Do I look hot driving your car? Girls are looking at me! Another girl is looking. I'm hanging up. Hello! Baby, I just saw someone driving your car. What happened? Nothing happened. I'm busy now. Wait! Are you hiding something from me? Nothing! Bye. Hold on! I just... THE LITTLE MERMAID: DID YOU FIND YOUR CAR? It's me. I found my car. Can I take you to dinner to say thank you? It's just a dinner. Nothing special. It's fine now. Let's eat. You got a call last night, but I didn't pick up. Must be your girlfriend... I don't have one yet. I was hoping I'd get one after this dinner. By the way, this afternoon, I remembered what I said last night. The truth is... I've been thinking of you. We've just met, but there's one thing I'm sure of. I want a chance with you. Step five, the most important step. Once the prey has developed certain feelings for the hunter, a cheesy love confession will definitely win her heart! Actually... I... Did I make you wait? Sorry, I'm late. Where's Han? - Han told you to come here? - Right. Have a seat. I'll call her. OK. Hi, I'm Nam, a friend of My's family. And you? I'm Huy. Her boyfriend. Nice to meet you. - Hello? - Han. Nam's here with us. I know. - You... - My. - What? - Let me talk to Han. Han. I think I went to the wrong place. Where is it again? No, that's the right place. Stay there with My. OK. I got it. I'm heading there now. No. Hold on! I should go now. See you later. Goodbye. Why did you say you're my boyfriend? So you don't want your guy to hear that? Excuse me, more wine please! A hunter's top rule: Avoid other guys' pets. It's fun wooing girls, but a taken girl is a waste of time. There's no point being "the other guy". Check, please! Sorry for wasting your time. How long are you gonna hide your feelings? I don't know. Listen to my expert advice. The best way to end an unrequited love is to confess. Hello? I'm so sad. Come play video games with me. Where are your girls? I have too much work to finish. Ok then. Work hard. Sir, Miss My is here. What's wrong, My? I want to confess... I'm not your pet. Don't just call me whenever you feel like it. I'm sorry. I got myself into some bullshit. What's wrong? What's wrong? I... I don't know if you've noticed... that I... I like you. I... It's OK. I'm glad I finally told you. You don't have to say anything. I like you, too. I thought I almost closed the deal. But who knows... it wasn't even my deal to begin with. Poor you. Forget it. Let's hang out. Sure. Same place, OK? I really care about you. But you're just like... Like a sister? I'm sorry. Hello? Where's My? - Is that you, Han? - Uhm. Thank you. For what? For sending that guy over to ruin our date. You did it! Is My with you now? No. I can't reach her on the phone. Do you know where she is? No. Hello? Did you find her? Where does that guy live? Han's looking for you. I searched for you everywhere! Don't you know? Don't be so disrespectful. Oh, you got rejected? Thanks to you and your expert advice. Do you want to keep dreaming hopelessly about him until you're old? Hopeless is still better than heartless. Come on! Be fair! I know how you're feeling. I've been heart-broken once. Don't believe me? Let me tell you my story. A long time ago, I met her on a huge cruise ship. Our love was beautiful. We were like in a movie, spreading wings in the ocean wind. Unfortunately, she was already engaged. Our love was forbidden. So... her and I... Stop! Is it Titanic? Yes. Such a great movie, isn't it? I was teasing you. Honestly, I want to empathize with you. But I've never been rejected before. I don't know what to say. Liar! Who's the guy I just turned down? Well... Maybe I am that guy. Are you done crying? Yeah, thank you. You can leave now. Now you ditch me because you don't need me anymore. OK. It's late. Get home safe. By the way, find something fun to do. Listen to music, for example. Well, then how about... watch a movie, eat out, wander around. I wanna try driving. Slow down! Slow down! Stop! Stop! Slow down! Slow down! Where are you now? I've been waiting forever. Slow down! Slow down! Huy! Huy! Huy! There's a car in front of you! Watch out! Huy! Pull over! Pull over! Trying to kill yourself? Or are you trying to kill me? If you want to die, do it alone! Don't drag others into it. OK? A girl like you, no wonder that guy said no! Hey, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. Please don't cry... Well... It's my fault. I was so heartless. My fault... You just admitted that you're heartless. Stand up! Get out of my car! I'm sorry. Move aside! I'll drive! Stand up! Quick! Get out! I had so much fun driving. One more time, please. I don't wanna die! - OK? - I'll be careful this time. I'll teach you later. I don't need it. As you can see, I'm an excellent first-timer. Right. Why are your eyes so red? What did you do to her? Do you know she has asthma? What if something happened to her? No, I didn't know it! - You're so... - I'm all right. Go home now. I had so much fun today. Thank you. OK, I'm leaving. CHI STYLIST: 12 NEW MESSAGES 16 MISSED CALLS Huy! I heard car crash sounds... Are you all right? I'm all right. Don't worry. But I'm busy now. We can't meet today. See you later. Hold on! Let me... TO CHI STYLIST: LET'S BREAK... I WAS SO WORRIED ABOUT YOU WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU? ARE YOU HIDING SOMETHING? PLEASE CALL ME BACK... I COULDN'T REACH YOU... Hello. It's me. Are you free now? Let's meet. No, I'm not. I'll be out of town for a few days for work. Chi! We're ready to go. Hurry up! Wait a minute, please. What is it? Tell me. Well... Not now. Call me when you're back. See ya. Stop pulling my headphones, will you? How are you now? Feeling better? A bit. Do you want to hear more expert advice? Yeah, tell me. The best way to get over someone is to find someone else. What do you mean? The truth is, after last night, I decided not to see you again. But I let it go. I'll give you another chance. Give "me" a chance? No, I mean... Let's give us another chance. Shall we? Stop talking nonsense. Let me listen to my music. Sit down. STEP FIVE: SINCERITY What? So... you like Huy, huh? I guess so. But Sagittarius and Pisces are not compatible. I think Chi is right. Astrology is not always accurate. Life is about making choices. Why do you follow her advice? She was drunk. I always thought Pisces and Cancer would be great together. But now... Don't worry. I can take care of myself. It's up to you. I'm just worried. How's everything? Man, I'm exhausted. I just wanna sleep. Keep fighting, my panda! The meeting with publisher is next week. Honey, I miss you so much! I miss you too, babe. Let's hook up. Jeez... You're at the library, right? Find me our school yearbook from three years ago. See? Ikebana club, cooking club, cosplay club. Princess Lam. He's the boyfriend of Huy, your Sagittarius! What took you so long? Give me a hand. Lots of food. I'm starving. Let's eat. Huy! Han! My! What are you doing here? To talk to you and your boyfriend. Boyfriend? What do you mean? Han, stay calm! You stay still. If you two are in love, just come out. Be true to yourselves. Why did you flirt with my friend? What nonsense are you talking about? My, it's not like that. I knew you would say that. But I have evidence. Look at yourself. Your hair is always glossy, your clothes are showy, and your socks, always dotted! And you, Lam. You don't recognize me, do you? But we met three years ago. I'm in charge of the student clubs. You were widely known as Princess Lam in our university. I have... This is the yearbook which includes many photos of you in female outfits. Let me see. I don't judge you. I even want to support you. But you can't use my friend as a cover-up. I'm serious. And I'm serious, too. Yes, these are cosplay photos... of a male manga character. Fine. Go ahead. Laugh as much as you want. I know I'm dumb and hasty. My! Go home now! But I want to stay here with everyone. Whatever. Hold on! One question is still unanswered. What now? Take it slow. Let the detective do his job. Three years younger. Member of the Student Association Board. In charge of student clubs. Am I right? Quick! Follow me! I'll show you something very special. Ta-da! Let me introduce... One of the main characters in my comic book. I mean, our comic book. A modern-day version of Cinderella. We call one of our housemates Cinderella, too. Why is she Cinderella? She never gets home before midnight. This one is totally different. Our Cinderella is hard-working, tidy, disciplined, sharp-witted... and hates being disturbed. She sounds like a boring old lady. Who would read that comic book? - Doesn't ring any bell? - Nope. This character is based on Lam's unrequited love in his senior year. Stop it. Let me finish. The picture is quite clear now. That old lady is... you, Han. Me? Lam! You're straight? So this is me? Who else could it be? She looks somewhat... dumb. And how can she live underwater with headphones? I've heard that before. But that's how I like it. This character has to be unique, cool, and a bit silly, just like you. - I'll tear it up. - Hey! It's my blood, sweat, and tears. Don't do anything stupid. You two should be so proud to be the first to know the plot of our comic book. Here are the modern versions of popular fairy-tale characters. We have Prince Charming, Cinderella, the Little Mermaid and Snow White. However, in today's age, a curse is cast upon Prince Charming. The three princesses unite to fight aliens and rescue him. So the whole concept is fairy-tales meet science fiction. What's so special about it? Han! Don't you see it's so unconventional to mix the two genres? I think this may be better. How about Thorderella, Snow Iron, or Little MerHulk? That sounds much better. You're messing with my head. Your ideas don't help at all! Lam! Help me handle her. Me? Mm... Actually, we want to create a totally fresh story based on... familiar iconic characters. It's not only a mixture of adventure and drama, but it's also about relationships. The bonds between Prince Charming and three princesses, the choices they make, their friendship, and... their love. Hey! Why did you stop? Go on! I... Hey, you should be sincere and humble like him to convince people. I want to ask something! Go ahead. The mermaid looks like me, Cinderella's inspired by Han, then who Snow White is based on? Ah... The real-life model of Snow White? It's her. You're lying. OK. To be honest, Snow White... is based on a girl... I once liked. But it's over now. Is that true? I swear! What's been on your mind since last night? Nothing. Just something I've been working on... with some people. It's a bit disconcerting that I can't reach them now. I'm listening, Han. Right. Oh, geez. If it's too hot, how can we sleep? We're having a power cut tonight. What a pain! Come to my place. In your dreams! What are you thinking? What else could it be? Harder! Harder! Harder! Do it harder! Faster! Faster! Not fast enough! Speed up! You're so good. I had no idea you're that experienced. Yeah, I'm that experienced! I won! One more round? No, rest up a bit. I'm exhausted. How about some easy games? - Running somewhere? Stop! - Take that! - Bring it on! - Don't hit me. That's not fair. You can hide, but you can't escape. Wait and see. Hey. Do you want to know my secret? What secret? You're the first girl I ever brought home. So you always bring boys here? You can say that. Lam has a key. He often comes to play games with me. Lam draws so well. I wish I were as good as he is. I thought you like sales, marketing and management? Actually, I like drawing, but I can't do it. Why not? Well... I hate my drawings. They look like a child's drawings. I just can't accept it. And whenever I draw, I get bored easily. I can never finish any work. I didn't know a Sagittarius can have self-doubt. Interesting! I have weaknesses, too. You lost again! You suck! Someone's calling me. It's me. How did you lose your key? I lost it during my business trip. Where are you now? At a friend's house, to avoid the heat. The guy from the other night? I'll bring the key to you now. No, it's OK. Enjoy your time. It's once in a blue moon. It's not like what you think. Don't be embarrassed. See you later. Hey! - What? - Can you call Han? No need. I'm all right. I can call my boyfriend. Bye. Well, bye then. Is everything OK? It was nothing. I'm tired. Let's go to bed. OK. Let's go to bed together. T-O-G-E-T-H-E-... Sleep on the couch. Don't you dare come in here. If you don't trust me, just tie me up with a ribbon. No need. Good night. My! Thank you. My's asleep. So is Huy. He's dreaming of My. Liar! I'm really gonna sleep now. Huy. What? I want to say... thank you. That's all. I'll go to sleep now. This time is for real. OK. Good night. It takes more effort to break up with a girl in peace than to win her heart. Common ways to break up can't apply to pretty boys. One, make her lose interest in me. How's it possible when I'm such a great guy? Two, make her fall for another guy. There can't be any guys better than me. Three, tell her I'm fatally ill. That won't work. She'll cry so hard and might mourn for life. I have to use a very special strategy! Babe. I want to make a confession. This is my boyfriend. Our families are conservative. This will be a huge shock to them. However, we still want to be true to ourselves. So, please support us and wish us all the best. What a nice couple! I'm a yaoi fangirl. Let me create a fan page for you two. Poor you. But don't be afraid. Keep fighting! I'll always support you. Prove it. - Honey! - Sweetheart! Now kiss. Baby. Let me kiss you. Baby, we're in public. - But we kiss all the time. - Not here, baby. - There are lots of people around. - Just one kiss, baby. Enough! I get it. I always knew... that you are heartless. But now I know... you're also a coward. I'm not stupid! You can't fool me with this thing. What are you thinking? I'm really disappointed in you. Are you crazy? Damn! This has to be the last time! Calm down. It's all right now. No more, I hope. I told you. Don't date guys in night clubs. They're all assholes. It's all over now. Don't cry. There are plenty of fish in the sea. Rest up a bit. Have dinner with us later. It's gonna be a feast. We're having guests. Who? New friends. I haven't introduced them to you yet. Ah. I know! Your boyfriend, right? How funny. I just got dumped, and you got a boy. Everything has changed. I'm sorry. If it bothers you, we'll eat out instead. I'm fine. It doesn't bother me at all. I'm happy for you. You finally got rid of your hopeless feelings for Nam. I should go get changed now. - OK. - OK. By the way, what's your boyfriend's name? How old is he? His name's Huy. He's about 25. What does he do for work? Where does he live? He and his friend are in a group of comic book artists. What's wrong, Chi? No, it's nothing. I'll go get changed. Why did you hang your picture here? As a decoration... to welcome our guests. But I find it quite... Good evening. You guys are six minutes late. Do you have everything we need? Here you are. Thank you. Put them here, please. Do you need any help? No, thanks. Can you please set the table? OK. Hello. I'm Chi, My and Han's housemate. Which of you is Huy, My's boyfriend? I am Huy. So you're the house's Cinderella. Nice to meet you. Yes, it's me. We haven't been this happy for so long. You two are very lucky to have found my friends. They're pretty and good-hearted. It's easier to have than to keep. So please take good care of them! My and Han as well. Cherish these two guys. Don't be like me, dating an asshole who took me for granted and just called when he needed me. Is that how people are supposed to treat each other? Even worse, when he wanted to break up, he didn't dare to say it, so he had to act like he was gay to drive me away. Would you two do that to your girls? It is unacceptable, right, Lam? Why don't we have some wine? I'll go buy some. - Let me do it. - I asked for it, so I'll go. You guys. Come help me carry stuff. It's OK. I'll go. Why you didn't tell them the truth? That would be too easy for you. Now what do you want me to do? What can you do for me then? Lam. They know each other, right? So you were the drunk guy that night. The one who came to our house to woo My. Correct me if I'm wrong, but we were still together then. What game did you play? Two-timing? - Chi, please hear me out. - Stay right there. I've never left you... And now... this is how you treat me? My is better than me? It's not about My. I always wanted to tell you, but I didn't have the chance. Don't make excuses. You say you love My? No, you don't. Men like you only love themselves. You're right. I lied to you. I was a player. I pursued My while still dating you. But I'm trying to change. Would you forgive me and keep it a secret? Sorry. I can't do that. What are you doing? Are you crazy? No, you don't. Men like you only love themselves. You're right. I lied to you. I was a player. I pursued My while still dating you. But I'm trying to change. Would you forgive me and keep it a secret? Both of you please get out. For the last time, get out of my house! Chi. Where are you going? I'm leaving. I'll have someone get my stuff later. Chi. Chi, don't do anything rash! We were all victims! That's not the problem. The problem is... I don't want to see My again. - I... - Shut up. This is your house. I'm just a tenant. From now on, I will no longer be your freeloader. I don't want to be related to you anymore. And I don't want to see your fake puppy face anymore. Stop it, Chi! I know you're upset. But you shouldn't say those words to her. Go to your room and rest. It's you who should shut up. What do you know? You two have it all. Neither of you have to work for money like me! I gave up my studies. And you two just need to go to school, especially her. She was born with a silver spoon in her mouth. Going to study abroad soon, right? What else do you need? What now? Even the man I love has fallen for her. Han, if you were me, how would you feel? Enough. We're no longer friends. Get off me. I said get off me. My. What are you doing? Why did you push her so hard? My! Where's your medicine? Where do you put it? My? My! My! My! My! Sit up straight! Sit up straight! Sit up straight! Breathe out! Breathe out! Now breathe in. Take a deep breath in! One more time! Breathe out! Breathe out! Chi! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. Mind your own health! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. - Shut up. Stop it! Why do you keep saying sorry? You wanna drive me crazy? Just shut up! Chi! My always tries so hard because she looks up to you. She even believes in your drunk words, that life is about the choices one makes. She decided to take a chance on her love. We've been together for so long. You can't leave us just because of a man. Stay with us! Do you bring your key? I left mine at home. I got it. I'm sorry. That's for what you did to Chi. As for me, I don't need your apology. But I can't trust you anymore. Don't come to see me again. Hey. The deadline's next week. The publisher has arrived. Your idea is quite risky. But... I like it. Are you the main author? Yes, I am. Then I'm sorry. I have to turn you down. Personal reasons. Excuse me, I'm leaving. Wait! You're not better than me. You tortured My for a long time too. But I never lied to her. "Main author", please leave! And don't ever come back. Now you blame me for this? It's not what I wanted. How can true love be so hard? Back then, girls waited in line to date me. Work was so easy. Now... It's all gone. For what? If you still don't get it, just go back to your old life. And please, don't drag us into it. Don't tell me what to do! - Wow you're really keen on texting me. - Of course. You are the one I want. I'm an Aries, and you're a Sagittarius. We're very compatible. I just need to put in a little effort to catch a Sagittarius' attention. How long will you go on like this? What are you doing here? I'm only in your head. What should I do now? A comic book artist must be great at drawing. Would you draw a portrait of me? I've never received presents from a boyfriend... I'm sorry. I have to leave now. See you later. Hello. I am... Huy. I'm not the main author of that project. I'll withdraw from it. Can you please give them a chance? I'm listening. They say yes to our book! It'll be serialized. Thank you! What did you say? Huy! Huy! Stop it! I'm not buying that. Isn't it another trick from you and Huy? No, it's not. I swear. No one can reach Huy now. His family in Hanoi was informed that he's gone traveling. See? That's a Sagittarius' nature, running away. What makes you think My knows where he is? I thought Huy would come to see My. Huy can never cross through this door. Lam, you should leave. Are you all right? I'm fine. Let me see. If you miss him, you still love him. If you still love him, then forgive. Life is about giving ourselves chances. Do you understand? Someone told me that before. Thank you. ONE MONTH LATER So? How's it going? I graduated with... high distinction. Good job! We're gonna have a big party tonight. And it's someone's treat. But I'm broke. It's not you, of course. It's... Here. Princess Lam. Author of The Three Super Princesses. - So it was released? - Yes. I thought you tore it up. Ah... I did. Then I drew it again. - You... - I'm OK. Wait a second. I have something to show you. PISCES & SAGITTARIUS This was sent to our house a few days ago. Han and I didn't know if we should give it to you. One day, Prince Sagittarius embarked on a voyage. He met Pisces, the Little Mermaid. He fell for her right away. So he created a strategy including five campaigns to defeat Crown Prince Cancer and win the heart of the Little Mermaid. She followed him to his land. But after reaching the Prince's castle, the Little Mermaid discovered that he had two other girlfriends, Snow White and Cinderella. The Prince was hesitant, so the Little Mermaid felt deceived. She went back to the sea with a broken heart, and never wanted to see him again. Only then did he realize how much he loved the Little Mermaid. He gave up his crown and his castle and wandered everywhere, hoping to get over his dream girl. But the more he wanted to forget, the more he thought about her. The endless roads couldn't get her out of his mind. The short time spent with her was the most peaceful time of his life and became part of his memories forever. The Prince realized that the Little Mermaid was the deepest dream of his heart. He summoned the courage to return to the sea and look out at the ocean, thinking about her, missing her and waiting for her. He hoped that one day, he could see her, the most important girl of his life, again. He wouldn't ask her for forgiveness nor for a chance to get together again. He only hoped if they crossed paths that she would not look at him like a stranger. At least she would smile... and remember that they once had good memories together.
