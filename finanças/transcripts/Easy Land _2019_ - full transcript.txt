What's gucci? Hm? Yo! Are you deaf? Me and Arman, are just friends. There's nothing to worry about. Oh, no-no-no. I'm-I'm not worried, girl. I know my boyfriend would never touch a FOB like you. I hear your mom is "cray". Everyone knows what she did at her last job... legit nuts. I'm just wondering, how can someone do something like that? Going out onto the streets yelling at their customers like that? Part naked? I mean, I think that she should be sent to a fuckin' looney house. - You with me, girls? - Yeah. Tell me I'm wrong? You can't, you know it's true. You know what I like best about working with Arman? His talent at certain things. Get the fuck off me! Bitch! You have come to the right place. Our company uses uh, state of art, "Univer" material. If you're looking for something that will withstand heat, then this is it. Ah, granite is often used in Italian restaurants where open concept oven heats up everything around it. The fire... Jasna, can you come in here for a minute, please? Hi. Sit, please. Maybe one day, when you're ready, you can also go back to school? I-I have been practicing um, customer relations. Would you like to hear it? I'm very happy to hear about your enthusiasm. But remember what we said: that observing is the best way to learn for now. And studying the manual and uh... this is just gonna help people know that you're new. Oh. Here, let me-let me help you. - Ah, that's it? - That's it. Yeah, but we've had this conversation before. What do I say about construction standards? Site inspections are happening tomorrow, crappy work just won't cut it. - Hi. - Hi. Is there anything in particular you're looking for? - Uh, yes. - Hello, hello, Mr. McKay! - Hi Linda. - Hi. I assume you're here about the Richmond condo projects? - Well, yes, yes. - Wonderful. Right this way. Thanks. Oh, so we've switched to Univer materials - since you were last here. - Aha. Well, you know I'm looking for top of the line, right? - Oh, this is it! - Good. Show me what you got. Univer sucks. Oh, I-I'm sorry. I don't wanna intrude or anything, but I personally... I-I would never recommend. Thanks for clearing that up. Um I um, I specialize in complex building structures. So I don't know, maybe... if I can help. Where's that beautiful accent from? Serbia. Well, thank you. Thank you. Settle down, please. Welcome back to Personal Planning class, where we discuss life after graduation. Your future. Now, I know you're only here for another six months, but your next steps after high school are something you should be thinking about. Work experience can help. You will be expected to observe your subject, and occasionally help out if the opportunity arises. Child labour. Nina. I already talked to the counsellor. I know. It's not just about that. All right? Now, why haven't I received a proposal from you? I already have a job, I don't need another one. This is not about another temporary after-school job. I'll have that replaced. - It's okay, I don't care. - I know it's not easy being back in grade 12. I know all your friends are gone. And I know it's been a hard year. But I hate to see all your creativity go to waste. Remember those impressions you did in class that made everyone laugh? Okay. I got it. That's $200. Darling, you're home. Just in time! You can help me pick out what I'm going to wear tonight. Where did I leave that? What happened? - Nothing. What do you mean, nothing? Come over here. Show me. - It's nothing. Tomorrow, I'm going to your school. - I said it's nothing! I'll teach those thugs. - Let's just eat. We can order Chinese? Mmm. Mmm. How was work? - Linda's an idiot. Remember what the social worker said? Do well at your day job, and earn your place. Rebuild your life. - Of course, honey. Come here. What do you think? What's the occasion? Dinner with a friend. You mean drinks? - I said dinner. Are you a little deaf? - Didn't I say dinner? Where are those shoes of mine? Did you take them? - No. What's wrong now? - Nothing. I'm not hungry. Where are you going? Why don't you call Jessica? - She's at U of T! - If you fail the grade again, - I'm going to kill myself. I am living my dream... Oh yeah? working for Linda. Yeah, um... no, no, but actually, you know, I'm... I do have some bigger ideas. and um I was actually thinking about this community project center - Mhmm. - that is about immigrants. And um, it is um... really important to me because being an immigrant myself I-I think I understand the particular needs - Mhmm. - of what we need. And uh... thank you that's okay. You know, it's amazing to me the cultural differences - between here and Belgrade. - Mhmm. I was in Belgrade a few years ago, as I was telling you, for the architectural design convention. And the women, the women everywhere were wearing these incredibly high heels. - Everywhere. - Oh, did they? - Am I right? - Yeah, yeah. - It's true. - Mhmm. I mean, it's a great look. Especially on you. - Thank you, - Mhmm. but I'm not gonna sleep with you. Ah, no, no, no, no. - It's not gonna happen. - I wasn't going there. Okay. I'm just saying. I am interested in your work. Good. Oh, actually I can show you something. - Sure. - Great. Um, it's actually something I'm really very proud of. It's one of my latest projects that I did in Serbia. Voilà. - Oh, you're in real trouble. - Oh yeah? Bring it on! Are you okay? Did I do something? Why does everything has to be so difficult? What do you mean? What's difficult? Everything. I'm sorry. Please don't cry. Easy. Easy? Yeah. Yeah, it can be easy. It's what we make of it. That's right. Look, why don't you show me that immigrant building project you were telling me about? Oh. You-you're interested in that? - Yeah, of course. - Really? - Yes. - Yeah. - It would take me some time. - Okay. Then whenever you're ready. Okay? - Yeah. - Okay. I got an early morning at the construction site. - Yeah. - Yeah. - I'll call the cab. - Okay. Easy... I like that. Eleven... twelve... thirteen. Aw. Jasna. Morning! Finish this. Finish! ♪ Must be nearly finished ♪ Grain... Grain by grain. Hello. Must be nearly finished. Grain by grain. Okay stop! Stop the scene! First of all, Jesse, no peeking! Stanley, I want a bigger limp. And let me just remind you there's a window stage right that you must go to first. Then stage left and straight to him. Understand? Yeah. I-I get it. But what's wrong with being a little free with this at this point, just so we can figure out... Figure you're a little too free. Ah, what about the singing? This isn't music musical theatre. Fine. Fair. I hear you, but... let me improvise a little bit. - So I can take this... - Who are you to change- who are you to change Beckett's script, Stanley? Save the improv and exploring for warm up, These are small modifications... We're running out of time here... Jesse. 10 minute break and then we'll go from the top again. - Hi. I'm Nina. - Yes? Mrs. Fraser sent me for job shadow. Don't kick the can, Stanley! I can't kick it's something that may... Shadow, huh? That's what they call it. Oh she's a very good friend of mine. So you want to be an actor? - No. - A director? No? Send all the troublemakers to the theatre, huh? - Thank you, Mrs. Fraser. - I'm not gonna cause trouble, I'm just gonna sit in the back and you can do your thing - and you can give me a mark. - Don't worry, kid, we'll find something for you to do. If I wanted to waste theatre air, I'd get a plant. Lights. Finished. Nearly finished. Must be nearly finished. Grain upon grain. One by one. And one day there is a heap, a little heap. The impossible heap. I can't be punished anymore. I'll go to my kitchen. 10 feet by 10 feet by 10 feet. And wait for him to whistle me. Yo! I heard you gave quite the performance. I wouldn't call it a performance. What? You haven't had this for a while, have you? Ewww, Arman. Of course you haven't. Saving it for some dude you haven't seen for a year and a half. It's pathetic. I don't know why I even help you anyway? Wait. Do you have anything new for me? No, I haven't seen Bob. But maybe I can get you a few more over the weekend... if you be good. Okay. I'm gonna need more. And fast. You know what? That's not to you. All right. It's a sensitive relationship I've built with the guy. I can't just go knocking on his door every time you feel that you need more. Arman... you're just the middleman. You don't matter. Is that it? Huh? I'm just the middleman?! And you're just some bitch who needs to get laid! Don't worry, I will. What is this? - Pills made me sleepy again. Is this for the kitchen shop? This is for us. Another one of your projects? - But this is for us. Why are you being like that, Nina? Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha-ha-ha-ha. Ma. Ma. Ma. Ma. Ma. Come here. No, leave your things. Okay, everyone, slowly find yourselves. And let's do an improv warm-up with our newest member! I told you I didn't want to be an actor. Oh, it doesn't matter. Everyone on the team participates. - I'll turn off my phone. - It's not about your Phone, it's about how I run the troupe. Go on. Ah gees, ah what are we... Oh, I got it. Careful. Hey kid, can you give me a hand with this. Ah, come on. You take the rock, it don't bite. Now, come on. Come on. Come on. Okay, scene! Let's take it from... Clov "It may end." Let's go now. It may end. All life long the same questions, the same answers. Go get me ready. Go and get the sheet. - Clov! - Yes? I'll give you nothing more to eat. Then we'll die. I'll give you just enough to keep you from dying. You'll be hungry all the time. That's $250. Thanks. Arman sent me. You go watch TV. I told you punks not to come around here. I gave that little shit a bag of phones a week ago. Can I have the rest now? Come on. I sold them all in like a week. Don't mess around, neighbour. Please don't do this to us again. Remember what happened last time. With your last project. You ended up at a grocery store. Then in the psych ward. Forget about last time. This time I have Ben. Was there drinking involved? Of course not! Why would you even ask me that? I just wanted to make sure. You know that drinking eliminates the effects of the medication. Your moods can start shifting again. Everyone's mood shifts. I believe it's called... - human nature? - Of course. But changes can be a little bit more severe after everything that you've gone through. The war, the unstable economic situation, being a young mother... Nina... is the best thing I've ever done in my life! Yes, of course. It's just that it was around then that you started to experience the mood swings, the instability... and finally, you were diagnosed. I knew you would think that. Uh, I'm gonna be going. Uh... I could be doing better things. And what would you like to be doing right now instead? I told you. I have a lot of work to do on Easy Land before I hand it to Ben. Oh. I didn't know Benjamin had given you a deadline. He didn't. I gave myself a deadline. Um, actually I-I have some bills to pay and this project is gonna help with that. I hope. Listen Doc um... I know you don't believe in me and that's quite all right. I really mean it. But please explain me one thing: why is it so wrong to feel things? To have emotions? What-what's wrong with that? I see that you are a highly intelligent and talented woman, Jasna. And there's a part of your disease that makes you feel that you can achieve anything. You may feel really great, sharp, ten times more productive than usual... until you don't anymore. And then it gets ugly, it gets really ugly really fast, doesn't it? - Hm? - Mhmm. And that's why the medication is so important. - I understand. - Do you? I do. I really do. So now you can go to government people and tell them that I've been doing great. I am very proactive and contributing to the community. - Jasna, - Hmm? have you been taking the medication that I prescribed for you? Of course. What? You don't believe me? Oh, it's not that I don't believe you. It's just that I'm afraid that if it goes untreated... Thank you, Doctor. - I-I appreciate that? - Do you? Oh I do. - I'm trying... so hard. - Mhmm. I'm... I'm doing my best. Are you with me, girls? Am I right, girls? Are you with me? Oh my God. Am I right, girls? Am I right? You're late. Come on in. Take a seat beside me now. You two. You're in the same sinking ship. Take a look at the wall. What do you see? I see an exercise for grade one students. Seriously, come on, this assignment is a waste of time. Psychology has proven that sometimes we may need a way to visualize our goals, otherwise they might seem incomprehensible. You two have one more week, brainstorm together. All right. Well, sure. if the school pysch has proven it works then, I wanna play for La Liga, grow a new knee cap that's not injured, and travel back in time. Can I go now? Visualizing a real goal might have helped your brother. Please think about it. Do you know how old he is? Like 19? Almost 21. Next year he'll be going to adult school if he wants to finish grade 12. Do you wanna go to adult school? No, I'm going to Serbia. Then, perhaps you'll take this last chance a little more seriously and actually help Greg. When will she be back, do you know? I don't know, I just got home. - Maybe she's at work. - You must tell her, is no joke this time! This time she very, very late. And she not pay gas bill since in January. How do you think I feel? - Pretty bad. - I'm finding new tenants. Wait. How is this to start? Give it back to her. Sunraj, give it back to her! You'll get everything by the end of the week, as I promised. What's wrong with you, Sunraj, taking money from my child? Jasna, you must understand debt is debt. You owe over $3,000. We had eviction hearing last week, you didn't come, why? You know what that means? I have full right to kick you out. Mr. Chopra, how long have we known each other? Almost two years! I know I've been late a few times, but have I ever not paid you? Mrs. Djuric, I give you chance, one last chance - you pay by the end of the week or I have no choice. - I call the police. Hm? - I'll see you on Friday. Yes. How much do we owe? Don't worry about it. Go do your homework. Don't worry about it. I'm going to take care of everything. - We were supposed to go to Serbia this summer. But you fucked everything up. I didn't get to see my friends. I'll go back to Serbia myself and stay at grandma's. Nina what's going on with you? You never tell me anything anymore. Who hit you? It's their fault you hate it here so much. Who did this to you? It's okay. Some girl Shandra, but I hit her back. I wasn't a victim. Everything will be okay. All will be good. And you know what we'll do? We will create 'Nina's section'. You want to? That's what we'll do. Look... We'll put a part here for you. You just have to tell me what you want and something you like. Yes, I'll let you know. Hi guys, you know where Shandra is? - Right over there. - Oh thanks. I know. It's just hard... like I can't be here. Hey girls. Can you give us a moment please. Thanks. - You Shandra? - Yeah. You the one going around hurting other people? Fuck off, lady. - Oh what was that? - What the fuck? - Let me go. - Oh sure I will. But first we're gonna have a serious conversation about your behaviour. Okay. You're legit crazy! Oh, is that so? Well, how about you, huh? Going around and hurting other people? - Is that okay? Huh? - No. - Hm? What? - No. What was that? What did you say? No, no, it's not. It's not okay. It's not okay. Good. Don't make me come again. Oh, Mrs. Fraser. Hi, how are you? - Great. How are you? - Good. I'm Nina's mom. Nina's really progressing at the theatre. You should be very happy. Oh. Good to know. Thank you. - Bye bye. - Hope everything's well. Bye. Could you pass the salt? Thank you. Hey, you want some dessert? No, that's okay. But I baked this cake just for you! Here... try some. Oh, come on, it's not that bad, is it? - Jesse? - Ah! You jerk. Here. Some milk. Oh, you got that right into my eyes! What are you doing?! What are you doing?! Oh yeah. - Lenny is burnt. - Stanley! Oh, no-no-no. Oh! It's mustard time! Mustard time. Mustard time. - No, no, no, no, no. - It's for you. Here. Oh no! You really got me. You really got me Guys, you really got me. Oh, you really got me on the chest, guys. Ahhh! - Ouch! - That was good. Well, I never. You know we're counting on ticket sales, man, Oh man, we could really use your help on tech week. Yeah, yeah, we do have someone else, but she's just-she's just a kid, it's... it is no the same. Okay, sure, bye. Oh. Can I have a smoke? So why "Endgame"? It's a very important piece for an audience to experience. Experience what? Nothing happens. Why does anything have to happen? Because... because a story is suppose to have some kind of plot, and then some kind of resolution... I don't know, basically something happens that gives people hope, and not just tells them we live for nothing. Beckett sucks. It may help you to know that uh, Beckett thinks that there is nothing more funny than unhappiness. Yeah, of course he does. Okay, we're back! Call the actors. Let's go. Let's get started. Okay. Jasna, uh... if you don't have any prior arrangements tonight, could you possible stay a little later today - and just clean up a bit. - Of course. Only if I'm not inconveniencing you. I've just that I've been noticing a lot of dust around. And I don't have time to maintain the washroom so. Oh no worries, I'll take care of everything. Great. Thank you. Linda, I'm so sorry, do you have a minute? Well, um... I gotta get to the doctors office so. Oh, I-I hate to ask, but um, can I get a little advance now? It will help me greatly with some bills that I have to pay. Well, I'm in a rush right now. So we'll talk about it later, okay? Sure. Okay. Can I remind you this Friday? - About this. - Sure. Friday is good. Good, great. Th-thanks. - Just say it. - Say what? My mom's crazy. Naw, your mom's lit. Shandra had it coming. Hey look, I know a place where we can go hang out. Come on, Arman. Are you actually cool with failing? Since when do you care so much anyway? I thought you had your escape plan. What you got there? Mrs. Fraser has chained me to a theatre. How is that goin' for you? It's okay. If you like watching grown adults play like children. Dealing with this arrogant director who thinks he knows everything. There is nothing more funny than unhappiness. Shit, that sounds horrible. Your turn. You wanna be a mechanic like your dad? You think you're the only one planning on ditchin' this wasteland. I'd be down just takin' the car and bookin' it too, you know? Booking it where? My bro's got this really great gig up north. I mean, who cares if he didn't finish high school? It pays a shit ton! How do you think we really getting by? By sellin' stolen phones? Hell no, I'm done with that shit. So when is the trip? I dunno. It depends. You want me to go up there? With the polar bears and the oil rigs? Yo, it's just a drawing. Mrs. Fray, told us to visualize. Sorry. - For what? - It's complicated. Just chill out will you? Not bad. You can also do the windows. Mark the windows because the lighting is coming in later and we can give them some reference. Anything else? Yes, you will be also be doing props. Stanley is gonna show you The inventory backstage. - Aren't you, Stanley? - Oh yeah, of course, why? Okay. Where is my pie? Wow, nice tape job, shadow. Or should I say, our new SM? Um, what's SM? Props are back here. See, Larry is the Stage Manager, but he barley shows up. And God know Greg is lost with out him. So that's why it's really awesome that you're here. - Greg doesn't like me. - Yes he does. He thinks you have an interesting point of view. - I told him Beckett sucks. - Yeah. Exactly. This, I thinks it's broken. So you'll have to try to find a way to fix that. Also relax. None of this matters, okay? You're one of us now. Yeah. Your improv skills could use a little work but... yeah, you got style. Yeah, I think that's it. I don't know. Okay listen, we're gonna run through all the Clov and Hamm scenes, particularly for Mitch because he needs more work than anyone else. Are you here? You've arrived? Let's go for a walk. You stopped taking your pills. - I don't need that artificial, chemical-based medication. You're not healthy. Don't you understand that? What are you talking about? I feel alive! I'm taking my life back and making something for the both of us. So that one day you won't have to work for a Linda equivalent! You're fuckin' crazy! You need to be on medication! Shame on you! Stop acting like a spoiled brat. You should be ashamed of yourself. Did you hear me? Open the door. You know where that attitude is going to get you? Nowhere! Open the door, do you hear me? Nina, open the fucking door or I'll break it down myself. I'm coming next week. Linda. I was wondering if now - is a good time for us to talk... - Actually Jasna, I have a question for you first and then you can ask me anything you like. Okay. Why do I have an old sink in a box in the storage room? Oh. The customer returned it today. It looked like a manufacturing mistake. - Manufacturing mistake? - Yeah. See, I just-I just don't understand how you can be the judge of something like that. Well, it was kind of obvious. - Obvious? - Mhmm. Okay. Well, the stores no return policy is also very obvious. Jasna, I promised that I would help you. The social worker was very frank, he said you were going through a tough time and I will help you, but only if you can adhere to store policy. But that's ridiculous! The thing was actually broken. And I don't think it's really fair. - Fair? - Yeah. Okay. Jas... How do you think that I got where I am today? I worked hard for many years to build this business and I know that you don't think that I deserve it, but I just-I don't understand why you would feel that way. Because I do deserve it, and it is fair. Okay. I'm s... I guess... the question I have for you is this: why is it so hard for you to respect me? Jasna. Didn't you have something to ask me? I can't fuck around with you anymore. I can't. Okay. But I don't Not a chance. - Leave me alone, woman. - Okay. That's... Stop pestering me already. Are we starting now or not? all right brake is over. Why don't we do a full run, huh? - It's time. How are you feeling? - All right. And Nina, make sure you have your prop copy as a guide. this is just the start. We're starting tech tomorrow. Does that mean the lighting guy is coming tomorrow? I will teach you the lighting board. It's a good skill for you to have in any case. Okay. Everyone places. House lights are fading... and lights are coming up. Did I hear you say gray? Light black from pole to pole. You exaggerate. Don't stay there. You give me the shivers. Why this farce, day after day? Routine. One never knows. Last night I saw inside my breast. There was a big sore. Pah! You saw your heart. Stanley is really good at that improve thing. You should let him show you. - Clov... - Yes. I think you're taking this "shadow" thing a little too seriously. What's happening? Something is taking its course. - Clov! - What is it? We're no beginning to... to... mean something? Stop! I like to try something new. Why don't we pretend Clov actually has a choice. If you want to leave, leave, if you want to get closer, more intimate, you can do that. Forget about the blocking we had before, and move freely in this part. Okay. Let's take it again from "why this farce day after day". Why this farce, day after day? Routine. One never knows. Last night I saw inside my breast. There was a big... sore. Hey, honey, how was your work experience? - Great. You want to order Chinese? Great! Call me when you get here. Well, think of someone who has left everything behind, possibly to feel at home again? No. What did you say? No, of course not. You think that it's just that easy to start everything from scratch? That's why we need this It's-it's to... Ah? Exactly. Thank you. Oh. It's to make transition... and besides all... the beautiful gardens, and a little spa, and a Language centre there is one, there's one special place worth mentioning. Yes. It's inspired by my daughter. Oh! Oh, you have a daughter, too. Wonderful. Jasna. Yes. Well, then you understand... how important this is. Jasna. Oh, a must. Absolutely. - Well, it's... - Jasna! To, to defend... JASNA! It's late, shouldn't you be sleeping? - Hello. - Oh. Hi. Hi. How may I help you today? Is Benjamin MacKay here? - Yes, of course. - Oh, great. Um, did you have an appointment? Oh, no. Um... I just spoke to him directly, and we're making plans to see each other. He told me to stop by when I'm ready so. Oh, I see. Um... unfortunately Mr. Mackay is super busy today, and I don't actually think he has time to see you. Perhaps we can try to reschedule something? Oh um... you know what? I'll-I'll just wait here. I'll wait for him until he's done. - Oh, you sure? - That-that's totally fine. - Yeah. Thanks. - All right. Wow, it is happening. We'll get revised drawings to your team next week, - with new footprint. Right? - Yeah. Yeah. Okay? Thank you, Howard. Hi Ben. - Uh, give me a moment. - Sure. Thanks. Yeah, just um, thanks for coming Howard, okay? Sure. - Hi. - Hi. Remember that night when we were talking... Let's-let's go to the conference room. Sarah, when the contractors come can you ask them - to wait a few minutes? - All right. Thank you. Jasna, it's this way. - Um, oh, I-I'm so sorry. - It's okay. I got this. - Thank you. - It's just through here. - Should I bring my bag? - No, it'll be fine right here. It'll be safe. Keep an eye on things. Just-just... Remember that night when we were talking about and you said it's gonna be easy. - Uh, yeah, yeah. - Yeah? Well, uh, here it is! - This is that Easy Land. - Yeah, um... you've been working. - Oh I'm sorry. - That's okay. Yeah, it's just now falling apart. All right well... why don't you have a seat and uh, - Sure. - can I get you a glass of water or anything? - Um, no. - Okay. - All right. - No. Maybe it's a little too big. I mean, it can be downsized. No. No, it's uh... you've been working. Yeah. Ma-ma-ma. La-la-la-la. You're late. Sorry. Try to be on time from now on. You know how much we still have left to do. We have tech rehearsal, I still gotta teach you so much. And then you have to be very specific about how we plot the lighting because Beckett requires... It's been a couple of weeks so... Oh. Of course. You deserve a mark. Does this mean that you won't be here for the run? Well, I'm leaving the country soon. Larry is gonna be here, right? We all have to make our own choices, Nina. I just hope that whatever you choose to do in the future fulfills you. Thanks, Greg. Okay, we're back. From the top. Jasna. Turn around. What happened? Where is Easyland? I presented it to Ben. I'm a little tired. Come sit down. What did he say? He really liked it. He wanted to take a look at the model in detail so I left it with him. - Really? Are you okay? Come on, it'll get cold. You know what this means? - Eat, it'll get cold. - Take off your jacket. Your dream came true! You're going to be a successful architect. And I'm going to finish school. It was a great idea. You wouldn't be making something like this up? Of course I wouldn't. - Good morning. - Good morning. She left it for me to give you. Bye. Have you seen Arman? Have you guys seen Arman? Hello. Hi. It's Arman's friend. Is he home? No. Is Arman here? My mom already told you. No. - What the hell? - Sorry, it's just... aren't you supposed to be up North? That shit got wrecked. There is no more work in the oil fields. Don't you watch the news, girl? Hey... what you doing here? What happened to Serbia? That shit got wrecked? Do you wanna go to our hangout spot? It's freezing out here. Okay. Com' on. - Can you keep quiet? - Yeah. Com' on. Arman, are you gonna watch the game? I'm tired man, had a long workout. So you're here for good, yeah? Yeah. Shh. Shh. I have to go. My mom is gonna worry. So I'll see you soon then. Yeah. Mama! Mama! 911 what's your emergency! I think my mom took too many pills. Mama! Mama! We'll make a new Easyland. We'll make it together... It'll be... We'll make... We'll make a new one. I'll help you... It was a great idea... I really liked the idea. It was a great idea. I'll make it with you.
