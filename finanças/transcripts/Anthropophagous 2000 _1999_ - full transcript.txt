It's almost over. Like they say, I think the kid's got football boots and he uses them to take dancing lessons. (chuckling) - Wait 'til we get on the water. See how he likes that! (laughing) - No, I'm sure if there'd been any danger, the doctor wouldn't have let her take the trip. Anyway, we'll just be making little hops from island to island. - I wouldn't count on that too much. You know what Alan said, we paid rent on that thing for a month and should get all the use of it we can and see the whole archipelago! - [Man] Yeah, but with Maggie in her condition we can't really-- - That just means you'll leave Maggie and me off at the first island and pick us up on the way back! (chuckling) - Come on, Honey. Sit down. - I suppose I should. (cries out) - Careful. - Hey. - Oh hell. I'm so sorry. - It's nothing, really. - Please let me buy you another one. - Oh no. - I mean, it's the very least I can do. - My husband does something like that at least once a day. - I'm really sorry. - No, honestly, there's no problem. But, excuse me, I thought I heard you talking about a boat. Do you think you might possibly have room for one more? - Do you, do you mean you want to come with us? Hey, kids! Do you think Alan would object if we brought someone else along? - Not if it's someone like her! - I have to join some friends on one of the islands. I just need a lift. - Well, sounds fine, huh? - Hell, yeah! (gentle music) - I bet he's not here yet. - As usual! - He's never been on time in his life. - Hey, there he is! Hey, Alan! (yelling) Here we are! - [Woman] Hey idiot! - [Man] Come here, over here! (laughing) - Oh you characters. - Hi, Darling. - How are you, Dan? Good to see you. - Maggie! Lookin' good. - How you been, Alan? - Hey, Arnie. - Hi, Al. Look! I want you to meet Julie. - Hi, Julie. - Pleased to meet you. - The pleasures all mine. Come on everybody, pile in. - [Arnie] Alright, Come on, let's go. - [Woman] Is it okay if I go first? (chattering) - [Dan] Would you quit shouting and get in the car? Come on. (chattering) - [Julie] Let's see now um, here it is. This is the island I have to get to. It's about 100 miles off the coast. - [Allen] Well, I don't see any reason not to include that island on our little hop. - It is kind of strange that there's no boat service to or from it, though. - Well actually, it isn't all that strange. For many months of the year it's nearly uninhabited. There are just a few permanent families and they're self sufficient. Only in the summer do the tourist come. It's an earthly paradise. - How do the tourist get there? - Either they have a boat or they get a lift. Unfortunately, I was delayed and I got there too late. I should've left three days ago. - Yeah, but we wouldn't have met you like that. (laughs) - That's true. - Well, are going to this paradise? - What say we put it to the vote? Yes votes raise their hands. - [All] Yes! (laughing) - [Allen] Then off we go! - [Woman] Listen I get to get by the window again. - [Woman] How long do you think it's gonna take? - [Man] You and your window seats. (chattering) (gentle music) - [Allen] Here, I'll take your bags. - [Woman] Oh, thanks. - This way, ladies and gents. Move, will ya! (gentle music) (ominous music) (vomiting) - It's okay, Honey. Don't worry about it. It's normal. We're all feeling a little... (gentle music) - Here. - Thanks. - It's great out here, isn't it? - It's fabulous. Excuse me. (gentle music) - Thanks. Danny's taken the plunge, huh? - I guess so. But it's very flattering. He seems a very nice guy. I like Carol a lot too, and she's crazy about you. - Right, but don't let the flattery go to your head. He never let's a chance go by. - What's the matter? Don't you like him? - Oh I like him a lot. He's my best friend. But the fact is Carol's my sister. Would you like to take over? - I'd love to. - Okay, keep your eye on the compass and correct the bearing if the needle slips away from this point, and it's easier to do than explain. Very good. - Thank you. - Here. - Hmm. (gentle music) (guitar strumming) - This row of cards is the past. This one is the present, and this is the future. - Oh, come on, Carol, let's forget about the past and the present! I know about them anyway. Let's skip right to the future! - What do you want to know? - Well, if it'll be a girl or a boy. How tall, rich, good looking... I wanna know everything about the kid. - Put your right hand on the cards. Okay. Now, choose three, and turn them over. - [Maggie] There. - And now, turn over one in the other row. - You awake? Hey, Carol! Are you gonna talk or not? What do the cards say? - I don't know, Maggie. Sometimes they're not very clear and, and they don't always mean something and right, now I can't interpret these cards. It's never happened like this. I just don't understand it. I think it should be done over. Some other time. - Oh, Carol, come on, I think the message is very clear. The two knights are, the two men in your life. One's your husband and one's the baby. Therefore it'll be a boy. The sun is a positive sign. A sign of strength, security. It'll protect your two knights all their life, then the night time is symbolic of peace and serenity. - And so? - And so it's time to eat. That is, if anyone can lay his hands on the can opener. - I'd better give him a hand, or no dinner. But don't think you get off that easily. We'll go into this again later. - The kitchen staff will need me to give instructions. - Thanks, Julie. You found something nice and innocuous. - But Carol, why did you stop? - I guess because the cards hadn't answered and I believe in these cards. And when I don't see clearly I can't just invent things. - Carol, if the cards didn't answer you, why worry so much? - If you ask the cards about the future and don't get any answer, that means that there is no future for the person who's asking them. - Hey, we're all ready to eat you guys. (water splashing) (gentle music) - Good morning! - Morning, Julie. - Hi Julie - Hi. (speaking foreign language) - The others are still asleep. It's not much longer to the island, is it? - Well, if the wind comes up a little, we should be there in a couple of hours. - Want one? - No thanks. - Will your friends be waiting for you? - Sure. But to tell the truth, they're not really friends in that sense. They're an English couple with a 15 year old daughter. I keep the girl company, and they finance my vacation. - What do you do in the winter? - Well, in the winter I study languages at college. And I work part time for a small local TV station as a programmer. And you? - Medicine. I need two more exams and it's over. And lazy cruises to the Greek isle will be over too. By any chance did you and Carol have words last night? - No, why? - Strange, when I awoke this morning she was already there. I asked her what was wrong, and all she would say we shouldn't have let you come along. Then she pleaded with me not to set a foot on the island. And I couldn't get another word out of her. But don't worry about it, Carol's a genuine lunatic. Has been since she was a kid. It's those stupid damn cards. I've never been able to rip them out of her hands. She's a nut case. (ominous chord) (gentle music) (speaking foreign language) (ominous music) - Careful walking down this thing. - You were right when you said it was a paradise. Why don't we stop over for a while? - It is an idea to be taken into consideration. - Where's the village? - It's right in front of that ridge. - Good. We'll take you up there, all right? - Yes, fine. - Okay, everyone ashore. There you go. Come on, Maggie. Easy does it. (cries out) - Maggie! - What is it? - Ow, my ankle! I think it's a bad sprain. All we needed, right? I don't think I can make it up that hill. Sorry. - That's too bad, but be sure to soak your foot in sea water. It won't swell up that way. - Shall I stay with you? - No, I'll be fine. You go on. - Okay. - So long, Maggie, and thanks again! - Bye, Julie, and have a good vacation! - Come on, Carol! - Maggie, is there anything I can get you? - No, thanks, really. I'll be fine. (speaking foreign language) - [Julie] It's strange though... - [Allen] What is? - [Julie] I don't see my friend's boat anywhere. - [Allen] They're probably out in it. - [Dan] Must be another wharf. - [Julie] Well, there wasn't two summers ago. - [Allen] So they built one in the meantime. - [Julie] Well, could be. (eerie music) (growling) (eerie music) (dramatic chord) - I noticed that there was a hell of a strong current bringing us into the island. - Yes, I've heard all about it from my English friends here. It changes a lot and never seems to be the same from one day to the next. You know, one day it will be pulling into land and the next day back out to sea again. - Probably influenced by the tides. - I guess so. Last time I was here I came close to drowning. The current swept me out to sea and I couldn't get back. Luckily a boat showed up. (eerie music) (growling) (eerie music) - This is more like a ghost town than anything. - Huh, well, Julie did say it was quiet here. - Hey, is there anyone here! Not a soul around. - Speaking of souls, maybe they're all in church. - There's only one church on the island, near the cemetery, but it's been deconsecrated. Just a heap of rubble, really. - Well, let's take a look around. - We'll go off this way. - Let's take a look in the general store. That's the telegraph machine. Looks in pretty bad shape. - Very bad, and it looks like it was knocked out of commission on purpose. Aren't there any phones on this island? - No, they've never had a line to the mainland. That was the only means of communication. - Hey, what's this? The last telegram out of this place was sent June the second. That's more than a month ago. - What's going on here? I don't understand. - Hey! (gasping) Little nervous, are we? Have you managed to clear up the mystery? - No. Where is everybody? - They're all trying to find someone. (eerie music) - Danny, let's go back now. (creaking) - Look! There's a woman there, so there is somebody around here. Come on. (eerie music) (speaking foreign language) Good morning! Anyone home? (eerie music) - Danny, the window, look! - Go away. There she is! Come on. We've got to try to talk to her. (dramatic chord) (cries out) (eerie music) (ominous music) - Stafis? (speaking foreign language) - The water's warm. Could you change it for me? (speaking foreign language) (water splashing) (ominous music) (water splashing) (eerie music) - Stafis? Stafis! (eerie music) (water splashing) (eerie music) (screams) (dramatic chord) - God, it's as though she'd been devoured. - Nothing! The woman's just disappeared. - Let's get back to the boat! - Maggie! Maggie's alone out there! (eerie music) Maggie. Maggie! - Arnie! Arnie, stop! Are you out of your mind? What are you doing? - Let me go! She's out there on the boat! I've got to get to her. - You can't swim that far, you'd never make it! - Calm down, Arnie. - Stafis is onboard with her. He probably thought there was a storm coming up so he moved the boat out of danger! - Of course, that's what happened! In the morning the boat will be right back here, I'm sure. - It's getting dark. There's nothing much we can do in any case so try to take it easy. - You're right. It'll be night soon. - Let's try to find somewhere to sleep, huh? - Of course. Let's go to my friend's house. I'm sure they'll put us up for the night. (eerie music) (thunder cracking) - Are these all their clothes? - Yes, but they've disappeared too. It's like a nightmare. What could've happened? - I don't know. I can't think of an explanation that doesn't sound absurd. They could've been frightened by something, run away. But no one runs away without at least something in the way of personal effects, right? Unless, unless they were really panic stricken. You know, terrorized. - There could've been an epidemic. Some kind of lightning like virus. - No. I've never heard of a virus like that and besides we would have found all the bodies, not just one. - There's that woman that Danny and Carol saw, she must know what's happened. She may come around again. - I think she would have done it already if she'd intended to. No, I don't think we'll be seeing her again. Even though she did try to frighten us with that little stage set in that house. - Tried? Hell, she succeeded! Though, I don't see what good it'll do her. - Hi there. Good evening. What a romantic picture. Not to meddle in your affairs, would you rather eat upstairs in your room or come down to the restaurant? No service charge. (laughing) - Let's go. (thunder cracking) (wind whistling) - Does anyone want some more? - No, thanks. - [Carol] Not for me. - We should get Arnie to eat something, I think. - I got a bottle of wine down his gullet. Better let him sleep it off 'til the morning. - Poor Maggie. We've got to go look for her. She might have come ashore before the boat went back out. - It would be useless. - What do you mean, useless? How can you say something like that? - Because I feel it. Just as I felt we should never have come to this island. But nobody listened to me. I had that feeling from the very beginning. But we came here anyway! And now it's too late. There's evil on this island. An evil that won't let us get away. An evil that sends out an inhuman diabolic power. I sense it's vibrations now. The vibrations, an intense horror. It will destroy us the very same way it did all the others! - Shut up, Carol! (sobbing) Tomorrow morning, we're all going out to look for Maggie. You with us? - What do you think? - And now we'd better try to get some sleep. There are two bedrooms. - I'd rather we all slept here in the living room. - Yeah, we can stretch out on the couches. (thunder cracking) (wind whistling) (piano tinkling) (thunder cracking) (thudding) (thunder cracking) (eerie music) (dramatic chord) (cries out) - I heard it too. Let's go see. (door creaks) (wind whistling) - Look, the piano. (cat meows) (piano bangs) (piano tinkles) (laughing) - Here kitty. (cat meows) (screaming) (crying out) (ominous music) - [Allen] Julie! Julie! - [Carol] Where are you? - [Julie] I'm here! (crying out) (ominous music) - [Allen] I'll get her arm. - [Carol] Arnie, help me. He's wounded! - Rita, Rita. It's me, Julie! Do you remember me? It's all right now. It's all over. (whimpers) - Take it easy, will ya! - Quiet, hero. You'll live. She didn't get you any place important. Just a cut. A pretty deep one, though. Boil some water to wash it and then bandage it. (wind whistling) How is she doing? - Pretty damn poorly. Her mind is in such confusion. Who knows how long she's been down there. This is the English girl I was coming to take care of, the daughter. - She's blind. You never said that. - It all happened when she was five. How's Danny? - Nothing serious. Just try to avoid infection. I saw some antibiotics in the store this morning. I'll have to go get them tonight. - Going now? - Yes, it's better. I'll get Arnie to come along too. (thunder cracking) Rita! You feeling all right? What's going on in the village right now? And what's happened to your parents? - I don't know. They're afraid. - Of what, Rita? - I don't know! I call them but they don't answer. Mommy, Daddy, where are you? Nobody's there. Nobody. Only him. I can smell him, the second he comes, I'm the only one who knows when he's coming and I'm never wrong. I know by the smell. - Who is he? How do you know that, Rita? - Blood! He smells of blood! Blood! - It's all right, darling. Calm down. It's all over. We're here with you. We're here with you. Don't worry. (wind whistling) (thunder cracking) (rustling) (rustling) (ominous music) (thunder cracking) - It's not too tight? - No, it's fine, thank you. You'd better try to get some sleep now. (wind whistling) Where's Julie? - In the room with Rita. (thunder cracking) (wind whistling) (thunder cracking) (wind whistling) - [Allen] I saw it somewhere over there. - [Arnie] Got it! - [Allen] Let's go. (wind whistling) - Want one? - Thanks. Does it hurt? - No, it's just a scratch. - Be a lot better if you could rest. - I'd much rather keep you company. (thunder cracking) - I can't wait for this storm be over. - It's all ready stopped raining, but there's still a lot of electricity in the air. Scared? - Yes. - Well, you don't really show it. You know, you're really incredible! Julie, I, I don't know if you've realized... - You mustn't Danny, no. - Because of Carol, right? Don't worry. Between Carol and me there's just an old friendship. - Danny, I'm not interested. Honest, I'm not. - Okay, you're not, but I'm gonna tell you just the same. Carol might be in love with me but she can never give me what I need in a woman. - Why? What are you looking for that's so special? - I, ah, I don't know how to say it but I do know that I have found it with you. - Carol! - Damn you! It's your fault! Everything that's happening, it's all your fault! Damn you, you dragged us into this. You'll kill us all. - Carol, get off it! - Carol. (cries out) Where's she gone off to? That little moron. - I'll go see. Carol! Carol! (wind whistling) (thunder cracking) (sobbing) (eerie music) Carol! (sobbing) (eerie music) Carol! (eerie music) Carol! (thunder cracking) (eerie music) (cries out) (thunder cracking) (eerie music) (eerie music) Carol! (creaking) Carol. (lock clicking) What are you doing? Open up! Open this gate! Carol! Don't go away! Carol! (eerie music) (ominous music) Oh, Alan! - Julie, what happened? - It's Carol. She ran way again. - Where is she now? - I don't know. She locked me in the cemetery and then she just ran off! - Well maybe she went back to the house. Let's go. - Okay. (wind whistling) (thunder cracking) (banging) - Julie! (creaking) Carol! (gasping) What is it, Rita? What's the matter? - He's here! He's here, nearby! I can smell him! - Calm down, Honey. I'm here with you. (crying out) (wind whistling) (thunder cracking) (ominous music) (creaking) (wind whistling) (thunder cracking) (banging) (thunder cracking) (wind whistling) (creaking) (thudding) (gasping) (thunder cracking) - Everything's all right. I'm gonna lock the door. (door creaks) (lock clicks) (thunder cracking) (ominous music) (screaming) (crying out) (sobbing) (screaming) (ominous music) (ominous music) (crying out) - [Allen] Danny! Where are you? (crying out) - Rita, I'm here for you. It's all right. It's all right. I'm here. (whimpering) Alan! - Huh? Hey, what's the matter, Arnie? Move! - They're all dead. Why are we bothering? Everybody's dead! Carol's right. She said this place has a curse on it. That monster's gonna kill us all. You and me and Julie, everyone! - That's stupid talk, Arnie. The curse of the monster. That's just a bunch of bull! Danny was killed by a human beings bite. That is the truth. But, it could only be some poor insane retch and we have to kill him before he gets to us. So we absolutely can not abandon Maggie and Carol. Whether they're dead, or alive, we've got to find them! Come on, Arnie. Come on. (birds chirping) Carol! Carol! I wonder whose villa that is? - It must be the Weltman's. I've never seen it before, but I'm sure this is it. I read in the papers a few month ago about Klaus Weltman. He was shipwrecked not far from home but disappeared with his wife and child. - And there's no one of his family left? - Careful Rita. I think there's a sister. The paper said the tragedy sent her out of her mind. She was very close to him. Careful. (ominous music) There's a step up. The Weltman's have been more or less masters of the island for years. They've been here for over a century. (ominous music) - Let's take a look upstairs. - Come on. (ominous music) (screaming) - Arnie, go and cut that rope. Hurry! - [Julie] Oh, my god! - [Allen] Who the hell is she? - It must be Ruth Weltman. You know, the sister. - Alan, Julie! Come up here! Quick! - We're going up some stairs now. - Carol! Carol! What happened? - Alan, Alan. It's Danny. Danny's dead, isn't he? - Yes, but how did you know? - She told me. Where is she? - She killed herself. But how did she know about Danny? - I don't know, but she was good to me. Although she behaved very strangely. Last night, before I fell asleep she asked me if I, if I'd pardon her. Why? - Alan! Quick! Look out there! - The boat. I knew it! The current has brought her back close to shore. We've gotta go. We've gotta try to get on board now before she drifts back out again. Come on, Arnie! You wait here! (ominous music) - How do you feel? - A little dopey, as though I'd taken a sleeping pill. - I think we should be with the others! - Okay, just give me a minute or two. - Of course. - Julie, look, I'm really sorry. I've been miserable to you. - Forget it, Carol. Who could keep cool at a time like this? - Why do you think she killed herself? - I don't know. - Something horrible is happening. (eerie music) Is it a picture of her? - Yes. And this is the brother and his wife and his child. All killed in the shipwreck. A good looking family, huh? - What's that? - A notebook. Partially burnt. But you can read lots of it. Could be a diary. 10th of May, found the bodies of the two German tourists. A horrible carnage that is panicking the whole island. It's burned here. I can't make it out. - I think I can read something. There have been many deaths. Now in the village, they're talking about the monster. The tourists are leaving the island but he goes on murdering. The police have come but there's nothing they can do to him. I've hidden the bodies. Without bodies there's no proof. I've hidden all the entrances to his room. - [Carol] Julie, what did she mean? (ominous music) - Look, Arnie. We've got to find some way of getting out to the boat. - Let's split up. - Right, you try that way. - Okay. (ominous music) Maggie! - I'll go. You stay here with Rita. - All right. (creaking) (ominous music) (creaking) (bat screeching) (ominous music) (rats squealing) (ominous music) (bat screeching) (ominous music) (rats squealing) (ominous music) (gasps) - Maggie! - Arnold, oh darling. - Oh, God! Let's get out of here. (gasps) (mirror shattering) (door creaking) (ominous music) (cries out) (ominous chord) (ominous music) (ominous chord) (ominous music) (whimpering) (ominous music) - Go away! Leave us alone! We, we haven't done anything to you! Please! Go away! (ominous music) Please! My wife is pregnant, do you understand? She's expecting a baby! Our baby! Go away! Go away! Go away! (eerie music) (water lapping) (eerie music) - No, you can't do it. He's our son! - He's dead, Martha. He's dead. He's meat and I will survive through him. - I won't let you won't touch him! He's our son! (cries out) You hear! Here eat me! Damn you! - Martha! Martha! Martha! Martha! No! (crying out) (ominous music) - Sit down, Rita. That's good. Julie! Julie! Julie, where are you? - Right here! - [Carol] Julie. - It's horrible, Carol. The man is a raving maniac. (crying out) Carol! - Help. (thuds) (ominous music) - Oh dear God! (ominous music) Oh Rita! Rita! Hurry, come with me. Hurry! (ominous music) (crying out) (ominous music) Come on! (crying out) (ominous music) - Julie, where are we? - Shh, be quiet. (banging) (whimpering) (banging) (screaming) Get down! Get down! (screaming) (ominous music) (banging) (cries out) (ominous music) (screaming) Oh, my God. Rita, oh. (clattering) (whimpering) (crying out) (ominous music) (whacks) (cries out) (squelching) (thuds) (dramatic music)
