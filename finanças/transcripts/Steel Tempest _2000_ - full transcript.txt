(dramatic music) (triumphant music) - [Narrator] On the west front, our forces continue to build up for the final push. Sturmgeschütz and new heavy panzers join the build up for the great attack. One last great effort will see the final triumph. The full power of the Wehrmacht is about to be unleashed. Sepp Dietrich, commander of the SS Panzer corp comes to personally oversee the build up to the attack. More reinforcements arrive, you can tell from the determined expressions that our soldiers are confident the Anglo-American forces will soon be pushed back over the channel. The watch word for our troops is on to victory! (dramatic music) - Did you get that? Good. (booming) Okay now pan across the brigadiers and make sure you get the half track. Get me a shot of the Oberfuhrer. - Still in one piece Schultz? - Yes sir. - How much ammunition have you got? - Not a lot, sir. - You'll need it? - I'll need it. - Excellent. Stay alert, men, new orders will be issued at 1200 hours. - Nearly ready? - As ready as they'll ever be. - Do you want to get yourself hanged? - No, Herr Sturmbannfurher. - We have been in difficult and dangerous situations before and that's the situation now. We must have absolute faith in the final victory. One glimmer of defeatism from you and it spreads like wildfire. - Understood, Herr Sturmbannfurher. - You've been a good and brave comrade, Kleber. Don't let it slip now. - No, Sturmbannfurher. - Good. Let's say no more of it. Where are the panzers? - This morning they were about 16 kilometers away but they still have no fuel. - What is being done? - Well, what can be done? If the fuel turns up, the Allies have the skies. Nothing can move until nightfall. - Then we shall go in without them. - But the plan, sir, the attack must be called off. - Why? Did we tanks at Rostov? Did we need them at Kiev? - The situation is slightly different. - We attack, we win, tanks or no tanks, understood? - Understood, Sturmbannfurher. - Good, get them ready. - Where can I find Sturmbannfurher? Sturmbannfurher, is this second anti. Message from Sturmbannfurher Braun. - [Braun] I'm Braun. Where's your discipline? - Excuse me, Sturmbannfurher. Unterscharfurher Becker reporting. - Becker is the liaison officer from the Hitler Youth at Tilong, his men were supposed to bring up the extra supplies. - Excellent, we need men, we need ammunition. - Listen, boys. - They fight like men, sir. - We'll see. Where are they? - There were some problems. The other are trying to get here on foot. - The whole battalion? - No, just my company. The others were ordered not. - We were promised a battalion. - Those are my orders. - I'll be the judge of that. He keeps his base too far behind the lines for my liking, trying to save his own miserable skin. Let's hear what Meyer has to say for himself. - I've been here for two hours. - Like the rest of us. - Where's this quartermaster, then? - Here. What's the problem? Let me guess, please sir, can I have some more? - I must have more ammo than this. - Why? You want to take on the whole American army, do you? That it? You know we are short. Piss off. So how are we doing, host? - How do you think, we are all going to die. - You can't die, the black market would collapse. - Give me a situation report. - Well see sir, the Russians, they have half of me so the Americans may as well have the other half. - A proper report, Meyer. - Yes, sir. Yesterday, I lost 18 trucks full of ammunition, sir. Last week, I lost 24 trucks full of supplies, sir. When I have issued this lot, there is nothing left, sir. And then my orders are to drive to the railhead and load up. Yarbos everywhere. Dangerous trip, I might not make it, then it'll be me flying around in the sky with my own wings. - Enough. Have you been onto division? - Oh, you know me, Sturmbannfurher. I'll do my best for my comrades, trying to get what's available, and a bit of something that isn't available. You should try and put some pressure on division yourself, sir. You know the old man. Your family and his go back, way way back, don't they? I've helped him a time or two myself. - Withdraw that remark. - Yes, Sturmbannfurher, remark withdrawn. - We could do with your help with the old man, sir. - I'll see what I can do. (dramatic music) - We'll have a drink ourselves. - 30 francs, okay? - Oh you're a thief, Meyer. Alright, I'll see you later. (phone rings) - Hello, first assist division. - Habro, I wondered when you'd turn up. - Another eventful journey. - There are no easy journeys these days. - It appears our comrades in the Luftwaffe have left us to it. - Things will turn our way again. - I'm sure they will. - The old man says he reviewed some of your men the other day, he said they look capable. Are you taking good care of my old battalion? - Casualties have been high. There are more new recruits than I'd care for, but we can still give a good account of ourselves. Had a good teacher. - It's kind of you to say so. Schnapps? - Thank you, I won't. I'm here on an important matter, we are experiencing critical difficulties with supply. - You and every other officer in the division. For half an hour, let's forget all that and have a drink. - As you wish, Oberfurher. - I do. You know, Braun, there have been few opportunities for celebration recently. But for me, this is a good day. I trust it will be for you too. I'm pleased to report that there is some good news. I'm authorized to inform you that you've been awarded the Knight's Cross. Congratulations. With all my heart, I can say you deserve it. (applauding) You are now a hero of the Reich. - I accept this honor on behalf of your old battalion who have asked me to convey their best wishes to their former commander. - You've played your part as well, you take good care of my boys. - I will, Oberfurher. - Good, come with me. You've always been lucky, Braun, but you're gonna need all that you can get. Your new mission could be more difficult than anything we saw in Russia, I cannot exaggerate the difficulties. I've argued with the old man and he's spoken to Berlin, but the Fuhrer is adamant that we must attack now. - Impossible. - As a friend, I can agree with you. But as a soldier, there is no alternative. We're ordered to attack, and attack we must. - As a soldier, sir, we've had no ammunition resupply for five days, there is no fuel anywhere, we've lost most of our vehicles, yarbos are in the sky every five minutes, it's not possible to attack. - Both Dietrich and I are well aware of the circumstances, believe me, we are not blind. We've made your case at great length, we've both been onto Berlin, but it's no use. The order is for the division to attack, it will not be rescinded. Before you suggest it, no it is not possible to resign your command. - What do they want us to do this time? - We need to seize the bridge at Petit Ardennes. - How? - I still have some pull around here. I can promise you an entire battalion with the new heavy panzers. - King tigers? - They're already moving towards us. They should be here tomorrow, armies permitting, of course. And we have managed to get a few munitions trains through to the rail head. - That might give us half a chance. All I have left in the command are six half drags and the two geshutses of our own. We have enough fuel for 12 kilometers, that will get us to the bridge. But even if we can capture the bridge before the Americans blow it, what happens then? - You push on and capture the town. From the concentration of troops around there, core are convinced that the armies must have established a fuel dump, you capture the dump. Then, using that fuel, your battalion is to support the heavy panzers and then spearhead a drive by the whole core towards the coast. - Has it come to this? Scavenging for fuel like beggars? - The armies will not be expecting an attack and the old man has allocated all of the core artillery to your sector. Plus there's the verfers and the new heavy panzers. The plan is for a blitzkrieg attack, a huge surprise barrage, then hit them hard, hit them when they least expect it and it might just work. Like the old days. - In the old days, we had air cover. - There are the usual promises, but I wouldn't count on it. - As you wish, Herr Oberfurher. - It is not my wish, but it is my duty. One other thing, as a brand new hero of the Reich, we need your exploits as an inspiration for generations to come. You can expect a propaganda company to be along soon. The reinforcements will be arriving at the railhead tomorrow. Make sure you're there to meet them. Good luck. - Congratulations, Oberschafurher. I hope I have the opportunity to achieve what you have. - Believe me, Becker, you don't. After five years, there are things in here you'd rather not carry around with you. - Sir, some of the men in my platoon, they said that we might negotiate peace soon. - Armies are full of rumors. They feed on rumors. When they can't get to the ration truck, they eat rumors instead, believe none of them. They eat away at the fighting spirit like a cancer. - Can we still win? - You've been listening to the defeatists. Stick close to me. You never know, you might just come through it. (festive music) - How was it? - Not bad, not bad. - You should have a go yourself. - Welcome, honored guest. - Good god, Meyer, you've surpassed yourself. Where do you get all this gear? - [Meyer] Wouldn't you like to know. Ah, see, there's lots of other things I can get too. - Yes, like the clap. - I heard that, you pig. (cheering) I'm leaving, I wasn't supposed to be treated like this. You can all do it for yourself. - Hold on, I was next. - Come on, Meyer, you took my 20 francs. - Alright alright, there'll be enough for everybody. I'll sort it! After all, it is nearly Christmas. How about a song, Wolfy? - Always happy to oblige, Meyer. (gentle music) ♫ Silent night, holy night - Come on, Chantelle, there's only another eight more. There's another party on Thursday. Look, I'll pay you double for that, alright? ♫ Young virgin, mother, and child - I'll do them, but not that pig. - Suits me fine. - Thanks Voss, very moving, very nostalgic. (triumphant music) (cheering) - What's that there? - I give it. - Goehring, of course. Who else has got an ass that big? - They obviously haven't met our Sturmbannfurher. (triumphant music) - [Narrator] West front. The buildup continues as factories and workers all over the Reich give their all to supply our armies with the latest tanks and weapons. Despite the murderous attacks of the Anglo-American air criminals, train after train of vital war materials rolls into stations at the front, where willing hands wait to put them to good use in defense of the Reich. The soldiers' only request, give us the tools and we'll do the job. - We'll extend our perimeter to the east, bring up the second company, move the pack front to the rear. We'll have to hope they don't-- - Good morning. Sturmbannfurher Braun, I presume. - You presume correctly. - Scharfurher Miller, sir. Propaganda company, this is Sturman Prince. We'll be making a film of the attack. - No you won't. You will leave straight away, that is an order. - Well I'd like to oblige, but we have direct orders from the ministry. - What kind of a circus is this? Children, movies. - He particularly admired our last film. Victory in Normandy. - Victory? It may have escaped your notice Scharfurher, but while you have been making your pictures, we at the Leibstandtater have been in constant action for two years, cinema is not high on our list. Stay out of my way. Kleber, get the men ready. - Where do we do our ammunition? - Not from us. You see what you can get from core. - We lost our trucks two days ago, if we can't draw ammunition, then we can't fight. - Well then, you can go home. And live happily ever after. - Okay, are we all assembled? - Officer Oberfurher! - Attention, I said attention down there. Well. Here we are again. Another merry Christmas. Five years since we marched into Lotz. Five hard years fighting for the Reich. I have no doubt that the mission we are about to undertake will be the toughest of all those years. The Allies hold the bridge at Petit Ardennes and we have orders to take it from them. Somehow, I doubt they will want us to. But we do have a surprise for them. In precisely 20 minutes' time, every big gun in the core will be zeroed in on that bridge. To new verfer battalions arrived last night, we are about to give Tommy the Christmas present from hell. You all know the difficulties with supply. So keep your eyes pealed for supply dumps because, gentlemen, we are about to be joined by an entire battalion of the new king tigers. They guzzle fuel, so let's grab plenty to welcome them, eh? I see faces here I recognize from Stockmere. We were in a fix then, eh? That is where we should be now. While German women and children are threatened by these Bolshevik rapists and murderers, we should deal with the situation here swiftly so we can defend the Reich against this Bolshevik threat. Germany is calling to us. She needs us in her hour of darkness. I urge you all to be strong for your family, for your fatherland, and for the Fuhrer. Heil Hitler! - Heil Hitler! (dramatic music) Let's move out, give them hell! (guns firing) (shouting) - Make sure they push onto the other side! - There's too many of them, fall back! - Get out of here! - Move, move, move, we're pulling back! - [Sturmbannfurher] Move forward! Pick up higher positions on the bridge. Check out the coast is clear. Get the engineers over here! Someone get that back! - Tanks back in the cloud. - Move as fast as you can! - [Man] Man to positions, save the tanks! - Oh my god, get these off the bridge! Get this off the bridge, it's still wired! Engineers forward, get off the bridge, everybody except the engineers off the bridge! - Get off, get off the bridge! Come on! Come on! - [Man] Report to me! (triumphant music) - [Narrator] West front. The formidable strength of the German soldier proves irresistible for the Anglo-Americans. With the vital bridge once more again in German hands, tanks and grenadiers roll forward into more action. They leave behind thousands of prisoners. For these men, the war is over. They know now who the real masters are. Battalion after battalion falls into our hands and more prisoners are marched into captivity. More and more of the defeated enemy are gathered together. The defeated faces of the subhuman colonials tells the whole story. The panzers roll on. (bombs exploding) - Second battalion to headquarters, second battalion to headquarters. - They have taken the bridge, Oberfurher. - I knew they would do it. No wonder the Fuhrer has so much faith in us. Is there any sign of a fuel dump? - Intelligence appears to be as wrong as ever, there is no sign of a fuel dump in this section. - No reports as yet, Oberfurher. - Well we can't have everything. Order them to press on into the town. - [Secretary] Continue with the advance, continue into the town. - Tell them to report immediately as soon as they capture either a fuel or an ammunition dump. There must be one. - Second battalion move out, we march onto the town. (intense music) Forward. Keep your head down, Becker. (gunshots) Try over there, see if you can find a fuel dump. They're pulling back over there, try and push your squad forward. Can you bring your company up in support? - [Becker] There's a machine gun there on the second floor. - [Sturmbannfurher] Try and flush them out with grenades. - [Man] Medic, medic over here! Seriously wounded over here! Somebody help him! - [Man] We need a medic fast. - Second battalion to headquarters, we need artillery support, we need artillery support. - Sturmbannfurher Braun, sir. He says they pushed on past the bridge but they cannot proceed without resupply. - I know that, what does he think I am, a magician? They must press on into the town. - The ammunition is almost exhausted. - Must have more ammunition. - Braun is concerned that they will not have enough on assault. - They must look for resupply from captured enemy stocks. Re-emphasize to him that there is no possibility of resupply from our own sources. He knows that, they must push on into the town. - Where are the panzers? - He is asking where the panzers, Oberfurher. - The panzers will be here in due course. In the meantime, the battalion is to push on into the town. There is no alternative, they must advance. - Hello, hello? They say we must continue our advance. - Get under core, see if you can find out where those confounded panzers are. - The situation is unclear, sir. - Well find out, man. - Second company, this way, keep to the wall and keep your heads down! Keep your heads down. - First prisoner, sir. - Who asked for prisoners? - Alternatives. - I think we know enough about our current situation. See to them. - Finish them. (gunshots) - You get that, Prince. - I told you to stay out of the way. - I have a job to do. Orders, film everything, he said. Unrestricted access. - Sometimes things happen in action which should go unreported. - In action, yes, in cold blood. Of course, we could let the court martial decide the difference. - Take your squad with the grenades round the front, I'll take the back. And see to him. Becker, follow me. - [Jem] Jem, Jem, it's Jem! I'm trying, here, hold this. - [Man] Clear the bridge quick, they're moving up! - [Jem] I'm going as fast as I can! - [Man] They're coming up the street, they're in the buildings, get a move on! (intense music) (shouting) - Now that's what I call a German hero! Why not film that for your movie? That's why the party will never die. Raw, bloody courage. Germany will triumph. If only the Fuhrer could have seen that. - I'll make sure the Fuhrer does see that. Prince, come and get this. - What do we need to do, sir? - Without heavy weapons, there's not much. It will take too many casualties to clear the snipers from these buildings. If the panzers would get here, it would be easier. Still, we must try. We need to hold them until the panzers get here. You, go there. - It's too difficult, they have snipers everywhere, they're building up for an attack. - Okay, I know that you. - Panorama, panorama, see that guy over there? - You let me down, Kleber. Next time, no mistakes. Order the second company to fall back, I'll tell first company. Rendezvous with me at the first objective, go! Go go! Heinrich, do the counter attack. They're bringing up more armor, pull your men back! We need to regroup, I'll cover you. - [Man] Has anyone seen Braun, Sturmbannfurher Braun? Anyone seen him? - [Man] He went into those buildings! - [Man] There's a sniper! (intense music) - There's the sniper still at it. Get me that rifle, keep your head down, Kleber. Fall back, flanking movement from over there, don't leave anybody behind, nobody at all, do you understand that? Becker, we can't hold the position we're in at the moment so I want a slow, fighting withdrawal from the treeline onto this wall here. Make sure the men fall back slowly, watch out for third company over there, don't leave any stragglers behind. Understood? Go. It's no use, Kleber, we'll never take the town today. Get them to fall back, we'll try again tomorrow, make sure we don't leave any wounded, don't leave any stragglers behind. We come in from the east tomorrow, catch them on the heart, we'll have them that way. Go. (triumphant music) - [Narrator] The superior numbers of the Anglo-Americans have managed to hold out against the determined attacks of our men this time, but rest assured, the German soldier does not give up easily. Once these brave grenadiers have rested and gathered their strength, tomorrow we'll see a different result. (solemn music) - I'll organize the sentries. - There's time for that. Get yourself some rest, Kleber, you deserve it. - You too. I wonder if they'll counter-attack. - We have 24 hours. Let's not waste it. - How are the Russians? - Fine. - Good. Have we enough? - One more day. - Hope we get one more day. Didn't like the look of that sky one bit. We'll never get out if the yarbos come. I want this job finished sharpish. I want the half trek standing by at 1400 hours. Then we leave, and we don't stop 'til we hit the other land. We have got to get out of here. We can't rely on our SS comrades. But I have my little ways. Anyway, best to keep them short. Don't want our truck disappearing with all the cargo onboard. I tell you, Franz, I thought I'd seen it all. But this crowd. Is this the future? What will they do without war to keep them from butchering their way through life? We are living in the Middle Ages here. If the Fuhrer knew what his men are capable of, I don't think he'd lend his name to this. We have got to get out of here. If the doctor sees this, that we shoot prisoners, he'll be appalled. They'll all hang. - They only need the panzers. - Why hang around like them, waiting for the cavalry to arrive? We got those panzers to be shot in Normandy, no? We just use them. One tank is pretty much like another. The doctor will forgive us. Right now, our tanks look more real than theirs will ever do. If the skies stay clear, every Allied aircraft that can fly will be in the sky. When did you last see the Luftwaffe? If those animals weren't so thick, they'd know. When the enemies attack tomorrow, it's straight to Valhalla for our barbarians, I'm afraid. But I'll tell you one thing, I am not going with one, uh-uh. My children need a father, not a memory. So do yours, Prince. So let's get the job done and get out. Get the shots, play it safe, and get out fast. - We're in position. - For all-round defense? - Spread a bit thin. I don't think anything will get through. No no, don't worry, their ours. Next division, they've been pulling out most of the night. - So we're on our own then. I guess that means no king tigers either. - We'll never take this town, there's no ammo. - What have I told you about defeatism? If the armies attack tomorrow, we will hold our objective. It's that simple. You were at school? The Reich has been in a worse situation than this before and emerged triumphant. 1763. Frederick the Great. We needed a general then and I'm sure you'll agree we've never had a leader like the Fuhrer. I know the situation is difficult, the defeatists might even say hopeless, but our German history is a continuous thread that binds together the party and the people. Gives inspiration to the Fuhrer, it can inspire us as well. - Perhaps. - Now in his time, Frederick the Great faced a very similar situation to ours, in fact, if you look at it, the parallels are quite incredible. He was surrounded by enemies on three sides. To the west, the French. To the South, the Austrians. And to the East, the Russians. But Frederick wasn't daunted. He used his internal lines of communication to move his army from one front to the next. He defeated his enemies one by one, Germany emerged victorious. Frederick was the greatest general of his age. Now, I know, from where we are, it is difficult to see the strategic position, but I believe that the Fuhrer is an even greater general than Frederick. Frederick experienced difficulties, so our Fuhrer too must experience hardships on the road to final victory. - But some-- - Pessimists can be found everywhere, Kleber, it's optimists like us who will win this war. - Bombs. - What about them? Believe me, Kleber, your people are quite safe in Dresden. And the best way to keep them safe is for you to do your job here. - You have family? - Berlin is the best defended city in the Reich. It's them we're fighting for, Kleber, don't forget that. We all have to make sacrifices. But in the end, our fighting spirit will prevail. Remember Frederick. The Fuhrer will not let us down. We will hold our objective. We're experiencing temporary difficulties, but in the end, we will emerge triumphant. Our newsmen were busy today. Awkward business with the prisoners. Perhaps they should have an accident. Good man. (motors whirring) - The weather report, sir. - Well. - It's not good. - What does that mean exactly? - They're forecasting high pressure with clear skies over the whole front. - The yarbos will have a field day. We can afford to give up the town, but they must hold the bridge. There are four divisions which must cross today. If we lose the bridge, they go straight in the bag. I'm not sure we could recover from that. First battalion, shorten the bridge head, pull back on the left flank, that should hold it. We've been in worse situations. - We need to be quick. Intelligence are certain that the Allies will mount a major assault against the bridge this morning. It moves up two divisions overnight. We also understand there's a large concentration of panzers approaching from the northeast. Seems they're tightening the knot. - Get a message to the Braun. I don't want to hear about his supply problems. I know everything there is to know about the damned ammunition situation, but they must hold that bridge. It's the last escape route back to the Reich. Tell him we're doing everything in our power to get the panzers through to him. But they must hold out, 'til the last round if necessary. Well, see to it. - There's another message, for Sturmbannfurher Braun, sir. - Yes. - [Secretary] It's his family, sir. I'm afraid that he has painful news. - Oh my god. Not now, not now, how bad is it? - A direct hit on the shelter beneath his apartment. There are no bodies, but we're sure that they were there. Seems that it happened a month ago. The news has been rather slow to reach us. His wife, his children, his parents, they moved in together after they were bombed out. Do you want me to inform Sturmbannfurher Braun, sir? - No, let me think about it. You're sure there could be no mistake? - None, sir. (solemn music) (crow caws) - Bridge jam, very rare in the 42. You do lead a charmed life. - We can talk about this. - You Nancy boys talk too much. - We can do a deal. - What would the Fuhrer say, eh? Worms like you in his army. - All we want to do is go. - Enough evidence to get us all hanged? I don't think so. - If we were to leave it here. - Show me. The bridge! What does it matter now? Go on, go, go! (bombs exploding) - Big company, dig in from here, along the-- - Stop, Sturmbannfurher! The Americans, they are attacking. - Calm down, Becker. Which sector? - Not in town, sir, the bridge! We're cut off! - Damn. Have them make ready, come with me. Without the panzers, we won't be able to hold them if they bring up their armor. Tell Kleber to bring more panzer-faust squads. - [Muller] No, we've seen enough here. Berlin, and don't stop 'til we hit the other land. (gunshots) - They're bringing up their armor, and they're not anti-tank weapons at all. Not even panzer-fausts. Second battalion to division, we still have the bridge, repeat, we still have the bridge. Must have ammunition, we can't hold out for long. - Lines are down! That's it, their ammunition is finished as well. - You are the acting captain, it's your job. Try to get through to division. Second battalion to headquarters, enemy infantry are on the bridge. I can see a heavy column of armor approaching. We have no anti-tank weapons. Do I have permission to withdraw? That's it, we pull back into the temple. - Order the men to fall back. - Fall back, battalion, fall back! (solemn music) - Can you help me? - Not now. - Can you tell the way to division? - If I cared enough to know, I could tell you. - Which way is it? - They're pulling out. Take my advice, get out of here. - Which way? - It's over. You're young, you have all of your life. Go home. - Listen, I'm from second battalion. We're the ones holding the bridge. Right now, we're all that's between you and a bullet. - Right now, that would suit me. - Don't listen. Don't listen to him. He's a defeatist. Are they still holding out? - For now. - Stubborn bastards. I'm in the second battalion. I got hit two days ago. - Can you tell me the way to division? - If they haven't escaped already, they were 12 kilometers east, straight up the road. - We still have some soldiers. Treat him next. - He's got no chance. He's dead already. - If I wasn't so short of ammo, you'd have your bullet. - If we could open up a corridor, perhaps we could pull them back? - No use, Berlin would never allow it, they're holding down too many divisions. - Do they know that? - Not yet, they're still counting on the panzers to arrive. - So still no fuel. - They're not fools, they'll soon realize they've been abandoned and betrayed, sentenced to die by Oberfurher Escariot. You may as well give me the silver. - No, you're being too harsh on yourself. Sir, you know that the Luftwaffe have offered to try a relief parachute drop. - Don't be ridiculous, man. When was the last time you saw one of our aircraft in the sky? I remember that fat asshole Goehring and his promises at Stalingrad, I was there. - I'm aware of that, sir, then there is no choice. - I know that but do you think that makes it easier? These are my boys. That's my old command. They trust me and I can't do a damn thing about it. (intense music) - I'm here to see the Oberfurher. Now! - Upstairs. - Unterscharfurher Becker reporting, sir, from second battalion at the bridge. We urgently require ammo and reinforcements or we can't hold on. - You could have saved yourself the journey. This is no time to desert your post. - Sir, I was ordered to come here. We need your help. - I'm not a magician. I've done everything I can. I can do no more. - You're leaving us there. - They are. I'll be with you. - Sir! - Get back to your post. Your orders are to hold on. - With respect, sir, with what? - With what makes a German soldier, courage. - Interview is over. - Courage. - They haven't a chance. - Are you being defeatist? - How can we hope to survive without--? - With or without supplies, we are still a part of the finest fighting force the world has ever witnessed. The fight will continue. Now prepare to move the HQ. - Yes, Oberfurher. Heil Hitler. - Temper, temper. - Meyer! Thank god, look, I need more ammo for second battalion or it's over. - How is old Kleber, is he still going strong? - He was the last time I saw him, can you help? - You know, he's indestructible. You could shoot him, stab him, burn him, and bury him, and he'd still keep going. And what about the Sturmbannfurher, one with the badge up his ass? - He's alright. - Oh well, can't have everything. - But he won't be much longer if we don't get more ammo. - You know, that was my unit, 'til a Russian did for me. One stinking shell left me half a man. I'd be with him, I would, you know. - You're the quartermaster. Can't you help? - What good's a man with one eye, one leg, and no balls? - There must be some supplies in reserve. - How could you think such a thing? - Then what's that? - Uh-uh. That's headquarters emergency weaponry. - Meyer, give it to me. - I could hang for this. But you can have it for Kleber, for old times. Tell him it really is the last, and goodbye from an old friend. You'll never carry it all. That's my transport, this broken old carcass needs wheels to get it round, find your own. - You know damn well that's my only chance. - The keys are in the ignition. - [Becker] Thank you, Meyer. (intense music) - Someone get that tank! - Calling HQ, can anyone hear me? Please respond, I have a message from Sturmbannfurher. Please respond. - HQ! - Second battalion, sir. They are asking for permission to withdraw. - Then I can't do that. - What do you want me to say? - Permission refused. - Permission refused. - I must speak to Oberfurher Holst! I don't care! - Braun is requesting to speak directly to you, sir. - Permission refused. Close down transmission. - Yes, sir. Transmission closed. The car is waiting. - Yes, I know. I'll be down presently. Burn anything we can't carry. Evacuate the HQ. - Yes sir. - Hurry, bring these documents now, faster, faster! Hurry, get them straight on the fire, back for more! Fast as you can now! Hurry, don't hang about! Straight on the fire, faster! Bring the rest of them quickly. No time to be lost, hurry. Faster! What's keeping you, straight on! (solemn music) - Get down, Kleber. What's happening? - there's too many, we're surrounded. - Then try and find a way out of this position. I told you before, have faith. - It's no use sir, the second company tried to break through but we don't have enough ammunition, they're bringing up the tanks. If we had the panzer force, then maybe we would have a chance. - Then keep trying. - There's no way out, they machine gun everyone who tries to surrender. - Don't want us bad boys, then. Looks like our luck's finally run out, eh? Goodbye Kleber. - So death with honor. - Good luck, Kleber! - Heil Hitler! (screams) (triumphant music) - [Narrator] These are the men who are winning the heroic struggle on the west front. Men from the panzer forces, grenadiers, and airmen. In the midst is Scharfurher Muller, the brave and intrepid cameraman who made the heroic record of the victory against the odds at Petit Ardennes. His example to inspire us, the final victory is assured. (solemn music)
