[Guitar playing] ♪ ♪ [Cash register beeping] That'll be 62.03. [Sighs] Uh...my money seems to have mysteriously disappeared, so... You want to put something back? Yeah. Um... I guess the toilet paper. [Register beeps] Did you get them? You won't be getting... If you don't quit stealing money out of my purse. Oh, yeah. I had to borrow 20 last night to pay Pete back. "Oh, yeah." All right! [Music playing] Yeah, dude. Now we're going to some party up on montrose. You should come by, man. Ha ha ha! Damn it, Zane, will you slow down? Let me just call you back later, all right? [Siren] What the... No. This cannot be happening. What? This cannot be happening! Zane, you don't have anything in here, do you? Be cool, ok? Keep your...Mouth shut. License and insurance, please. There a problem, officer? There will be if you don't hand over your license and insurance. [Sighs] Here. You know why I stopped you tonight, Mr. Richter? No. Not a clue. I clocked you going over 50. The speed limit is 45, man. Come on. Try 35. Oh. Man, look, my girlfriend and I got in a fight. I probably missed the sign, man. Come on. It's late, dude. Just wait here a minute, please. What? Unit 412. Man! The car. I can get in the car myself! Get in the car! Well, looks like we got something here. [Sighs] Yeah. Now would be a real good time to start praying. [Handcuffs click] [Telephone ringing] [Beeping] [Telephone rings] [Buzzer] [Ring] Man: White residence. Hello? I, um... I didn't know who else to call. Hannah. Where...where are you? Are you all right? I'm... [Buzzer] I'm, um... Just tell me where you are. I'll come get you. Just tell me where you are. Hannah white. Yeah? Let's go. Dad's here to get you. Hey, Barbie, see if your old man will bail US out, too. Tell him we'll make it worth his while. Ha ha ha! Thanks for coming. I didn't know about the drugs. I swear. Shh. It's all right. Everything... Is going to be all right. Um...I'll get you a blanket. Thank you. So, we have good news and bad news. The bad news is, the police found enough drugs in your vehicle to charge you and your boyfriend with intent to sell. It wasn't mine. Let me finish. I just talked to the da's office. They're willing to reduce the charge to possession if you agree to testify against Zane. Ok. What's the good news? That was the good news. I'm not testifying against Zane. Oh... The man is a drug dealer. With two priors. Ok? Odds are, he's going to jail for a long while. There's no reason you should have to go with him. Ok. We have one other option, and that's to try to convince the judge that you didn't have any knowledge that drugs were in the vehicle. It's not going to be an easy sell, especially since you live with the guy. But since this is your first offense, you'll possibly get deferred adjudication. Layman's? She'll get off, providing that she stays out of trouble the next 6 weeks. And there will be a fine. Ok, well, what if I don't have the money? Then you'll go to jail. I'll pay the fine, on one condition. You come home for... I knew this coming. Actually, that could work in your favor. The judge is more likely to be lenient if he knows you'll be living in a stable environment. Fine. Whatever. As long as I don't have to testify. Ok.

When do you think she'll be ready to get up and sing for US? I don't know. That depends on Hannah. [Chuckles] Boy: Hey, look at the freak. Woman: Oh, now, Caleb, that's not very Christian. The poor girl has been through a lot, living with that so-called mother of hers. Who is she? That's brother Tate's daughter Rachel. Looks like she's going to be staying with him for a while. She may need a new friend. You want me to be her friend? Hey, it's our job to reach out to people in need. Looks like she could use a positive influence in her life right about now. Just as long as you don't let her influence you. ♪ We're stuck in this place ♪ ♪ we don't want to look back at our lives ♪ ♪ and find out they were a waste ♪ ♪ it's time to follow our dreams ♪ ♪ take a good look around ♪ ♪ can this be all there is? ♪ ♪ I don't want to get stuck like my... ♪ I don't remember seeing that one in the hymnal. Ha ha ha! Yeah. It's a little something I wrote back when I wanted to be a rock star. You wanted to be a rock star? Shh. Don't worry. Your secret is safe with me. You ready to get started? Come on. So, when you sing, always breathe from your diaphragm. Ready? Let's go. My what? Your diaphragm. You... Ok. All right. Right there. Ok. Now, focus your breathing where my hand is. Breathe in. [Inhales] And out. [Exhales] Breathe in. [Inhales] Breathe out. [Exhales] Nice. Ok. Try that singing. [Singing scales] [Stops abruptly] I'm sorry. No, no, no. That's all right. That was good. Don't worry about it. Come on. It takes time to learn how to breathe correctly. You're doing good. You'll get the hang of it. Come on. Let's try something else. Don't get me wrong. I love the traditional hymns. They're great and all, but if we are going to grow as a church, we got to liven things up a little. We got to bring in more upbeat music, draw in a younger crowd on sunday mornings. Well, good luck with that. Dad is pretty old-fashioned about those kinds of things. Which is precisely why I'm glad you're taking these lessons, because he won't mind so much if it's you up there singing... that and, well... Kids are more likely to relate to you than an old fogey like me. You're not that old. Yeah, well. I feel like I am. I just...I don't know about getting up there and singing in front of all those people. What if I forget the words or something? You might. I'm not going to lie to you. It's scary the first time, but, you know, the more you do it, the easier it gets, same as anything. Hey. Look at me. God gave you that beautiful voice for a reason. Don't waste his gift by not sharing it with others. Hey. Hi. Hmm... Well. Looks like someone's got their eye on you. Jeremy? Yeah, right. Oh, I don't know. He seemed pretty interested to me. Even if he were, it doesn't matter. I'm not allowed to go out with guys. Oh, well. I guess I'd better get you home, then, huh? Caleb, stop that. You know she don't eat meat. You don't? Father: She's a vegetarian. Oh, you don't know what you're missing. Lanette here makes the best chicken-fried steak this side of paradise. Lanette: Oh, come on! Rachel, have you started back to school yet? Yeah. Today. She had to get a shot. Shut up. What for? Her mother wasn't very good about keeping up with her health records. You know, I'll tell you, schools today are so full of bureaucracy and so devoid of god. That's why we home-school. No politician is going to tell US how to raise our children. Father: Amen. So what would 2 to the power of 3 be? Um...uh... 8? Good. [Telephone rings] Now try the next one on your own. [Ring] [Whispers] Thank you. Hi. Hey. It's Rachel, right? [Shutter clicks] Uh, Hannah. We had dinner last night. So, um... Are you headed home? Where else? Cool. Um... Me, too. Your dad lets you smoke? Never asked. My parents would totally kill me. Not like it's a sin or anything. Tell that to my dad. Where exactly in the Bible does it say smoking is a sin? Well, it says that your body is a temple, and anything you do that's bad for it is considered a sin. You mean like eating steroid-overdosed cows deep-fried in lard? That's a really cool camera. Are you in photography class or something? What photography class? They don't teach it here. "There's not enough money in the budget." Of course, there's plenty of money for the football and baseball teams to get brand-new uniforms every year. It's such bull. At least you get to go to school. You don't like being home-schooled? It's ok, I guess. I don't got to get up every morning and worry about my hair or what I'm going to wear, but I miss out on other things, like homecoming or dances. Not that my parents would let me go to a dance even if I were in school. They did seem a little overly protective. A little? Try no makeup, no dancing, no listening to secular music. Man.

You sure you don't want something to eat? No. Um...I'm actually pretty tired from the drive, so I think I'm just going to take a nap. Ok, then. Ok, mom, you're going to make me cry. I'm just so glad you're home. [Sighs heavily] Is your back bothering you again? A long drive. How was she on the way up? [Sighs] She didn't say much. Smoked like a chimney.

And I was going to see if Rachel wanted to come, too. [Sighs] I don't think that's such a good idea. I've heard stories about what some of the kids do out there. Well, I'm not going to do anything. We know, sweetheart, but that doesn't mean we want you around it, either. But... the answer is no. [Footsteps] Right. Found that duet I told you about. It's got... What's wrong? What's wrong, huh? Come on. It's nothing. It's just... What's wrong? Nothing. It's...I got invited to go to a party, and my dad won't let me go. Oh, well, I'm sure he's just trying to protect you. It's no big deal. He can't protect me forever. I'm almost 18, and I'm going to be moving off to college soon, but he still treats me like I'm 2. I think your dad knows exactly how old you are. And how beautiful, hmm? Hmm? Hmm? [Chuckles] That's better. So who invited you to the party? Huh? Who was it? Was it Jeremy? Yeah. I told you he had an eye for you. He has a girlfriend. So? That doesn't mean he's blind. Heck, if I were his age... What? You'd have an eye for me? What am I doing? I'm sorry, Hannah. I, uh... It's ok. I won't tell anyone. We'd better go. What a...Creep. He is not. He just got caught up in a moment of weakness. He promised it wouldn't happen again. What if it does? It won't. But what if? So what if? Then what will you do? I don't know. What? You want him to. I do not. Yeah, you do. No, I don't. You're so full of... No, you are. No, you are! [Laughter] Where did all this food come from? The ladies from the church brought it to welcome Hannah home. Wasn't that nice? All that's missing is the fatted calf. [Sighs] Heavenly father, we thank you for this food we are about to receive to our bodies. We thank you, heavenly father, for having our family back together again. [Door opens] Do you mind? Ahh. How many of them things you smoke a day? Still my conscience. I'm also still your pastor. If there's anything you need to talk about... see, that's the problem with being a preacher's kid. You can't confide your secrets to your pastor without your dad finding out. Well, if you can't talk to me, then go to god. He is always there. Yeah. You know, god and I aren't really on speaking terms right now. Maybe that's why you're having so many problems. Uh! Dad, look. I didn't come to get saved. Ok? You weren't expecting a revival on the first night, were you? I wasn't expecting anything. I'm just trying to help her. As her father or as her minister? I am who I am, Maxine. [Sighs] I can't just turn the preacher off and on. You can with me. That's different. Maybe we should consider having her see a psychiatrist. Ha ha! They are nothing but drug-pushers with prescription pads. They'll convince her that it's our fault that she's so messed up. That'll make her hate US even more. You know she doesn't hate US. She just needs some time to adjust. And willingness. Baptism is a symbol of rebirth. It's the purification of our souls through the cleansing blood of Jesus Christ. But more than a symbol, it is a real commitment to Christ, witnessed by god and this community. [Piano playing] So...you play the piano, too, huh? [Chuckles] No. Not really. I took lessons when I was a kid, but I only learned one song before I got tired of playing. That's too bad. Could have been quite the musician. Well...maybe you could teach me again. [Chuckles] Hannah, there's something we need to talk about. Um... I think we should perhaps take a break from music lessons for a while. Why? Is it because of what happened the other night? I told you I wouldn't tell anyone. It never should have happened to begin with. It's not your fault. Ok? I take full responsibility for what happened. Lilly and I, we're just...We're having some issues right now, and it just... it's got nothing to do with you, just stuff. And we... I just...I... Got caught up in a moment of weakness. No. No, not just a moment. Every time I'm with you, I forget who I am and who i'm supposed to be. Maybe I want to forget. I'm sorry. No. Um... No. It's just...What if someone comes in?

Whoa, whoa, whoa, young lady. Sir? Come on down here a minute. Come on. Got your lessons done for tomorrow? Yeah. Well, I was just heading up to finish them. How was your lesson with Neal? Uh...fine. Did you work on anything new? Yeah, uh, a duet. I can't begin to tell you how happy it makes me, seeing my little girl up there singing for the lord. She's not a little girl anymore, daddy. She will always be my little girl, even when she's an old granny. Isn't that right, Hannah bear? Dad... Ha ha ha! It's just sex. It's just sex? That's like the worst thing I could possibly ever do! No, it's not. How do you think you got here? You know what I mean. What, because he's married? You know what he told me? He said that he and Lilly haven't... You know... Since before the twins were born. They don't even share a bed anymore. If I popped out 4 of his pups, I wouldn't let him near me, either. Wait, you don't... You don't think that... I could be... I don't know. Did he, you know... You've got to be kidding me. Hasn't anyone told you anything about sex? Just that it's a sin to do it before you're married. Maybe you should ask Neal. What? No! No way. Why not? Because...I'd be too embarrassed. Embarrassed? You...you wouldn't understand. I'm not as experienced as you are, ok? Technically, you are more experienced than me. Wait. You're saying that you've never... Then how do you know so much about it? Just because I know about sex doesn't mean I've done it. I guess sex ed wasn't part of your home-school curriculum. Are you kidding? That's why I'm home-schooled. Wait. You are telling me that your parents home-schooled you all this time to keep you out of sex ed and then you end up learning about it on the sunday schoolroom floor? Ha ha ha! It's not funny. Ha ha! I'm sorry. You're right. It's not. [Both laughing] I brought you some breakfast. You sure you don't want to come to church with US? There's a lot of people who'd love to see you. I'm sure. Morning, Neal. Morning. Any messages? Yeah. Here you go. Thank you. Well, how's Hannah? Hardly been out of her room since she got here. I don't know what's wrong with her. Whatever it is, she's not telling me about it. Hmm. Well, you let me know if there's anything I can do to help. I appreciate that. That be all for you? Pack of lights, please. That'll be 8.32. Thanks so much. Thank you. Sorry. Oh, oh! Hannah. Oh, my goodness. I almost didn't even recognize you. Um, I heard you were back home. You did. How? Same way I hear all the town's gossip... the prayer chain. Ha ha ha! Great. Why doesn't he just announce it from the pulpit while he's at it? I'll tell Rachel that I ran into you. You know, she's back at school in New York now. She's about to graduate... I got to go. It was good seeing you. Take care. Don't be a stranger. Wow, rache, these are amazing. You'll definitely be able to get into a good art school with these. Well, that'd be cool. Who's this? My mom. You look like her. You think? How come you don't live with her anymore? She decided to move in with this guy, and I guess he didn't think it was too cool having a teenager around. But...you're her daughter. How could she just leave you like that? People leave their kids all the time. Not all the time. So what are you going to major in? Music, probably. Neal thinks I'll make a good choir teacher or something like that. Is that what you want? It'll make my parents happy. I think Neal is worried about me going off to college and meeting some guy and forgetting all about him. Well, at least you'll be able to go out in public together. Neal and I go out. The other night, he took me down to the lake. It was really nice. I'll bet you didn't even get out of the car. We didn't need to. Oh! We could see the sunset over the lake through the windshield. You have such a dirty mind. Who's this? Oh, that's some girl from our old apartments. She asked me to take some photos of her so she could send them to some modeling agency or some... There are two types of christians in the world. There are spiritual christians, and there are carnal christians. Now, spiritual christians, they seek to please god, to bring honor and glory to him in their everyday lives. Amen. Amen. But carnal christians... they seek to please themselves. They yield to earthly pleasures and, well, carnality. Now, carnal christians may seem to be spiritual christians. They come to church. They sing the hymns. They even bring covered dishes to all the church fellowships. [Baby coos] But deep down, they are drowning in sin... drowning in sin. Hey. What's wrong? Who took this? Just Rachel. Rachel. Does she know? She's not going to say anything. Oh, my god, Hannah. Are you... are you trying to get US caught? No. Of course not. I thought you'd like it. I don't! Oh, man. We have to stop seeing each other. What? No. What. Why? Because of a stupid picture? Because it's wrong. What we're doing is a sin. You never cared about that before. Yes, I did. I just... I don't know. I just ignored it, I guess. I... God spoke to me today. He spoke to you? Yes. Yes. He laid it on my heart to get things right with my life, before I lose everyone that I love. I thought you loved me. Hannah, I... I care about you... a lot. So much that it scares me, but i... that's why I got to do this now... While I still can. Rachel was right. You are a hypocrite. Don't you feel guilty at all? You know what? ...Guilt! My whole life, I have been told that I was a sinner... have been since the day I was born. So why should I feel guilty? Why should I have to repent for being the way god made me to begin with? If he doesn't like what he created, then...Him! Hey. You look like you could use an ear. I, uh... I don't know what happened to my family. Would you like to pray about it? Heavenly father, we...

Is that it? Whatever it takes to keep her away from you. Man, you're blaming the wrong person, dude. She was totally messed up way before she ever met me. Please... Don't call here again. Here you guys go. Hannah? I thought that was you. It's so good to see you. Isn't it? Yeah. Yeah. You look great. I didn't know you worked here. Yeah. I just started. Well, how are you? Honey. Honey, she's working. Of course. Maybe we'll see you in church on sunday, then. Oh! Sorry. Whoa. Watch out. Uh, yeah. I need a break. Can you cover my tables? Sure. You ok? Yeah. Did he say anything? Yeah. He said, "that'll be $24, you little whore." I'm kidding. Here. Um... I...i don't, uh... How? I, I... Ok. Oh, ok. Hannah, Hannah. Hannah, I could, um... I could go to jail for this. Ok? I could lose my family. I could lose my job. Oh, god! Your father could lose his. Do you think abortion is murder? My dad says it is, but I don't know. I'm going to need some money. Some of US are headed over to buck's for drinks. Want to come? No. I'm pretty tired. Maybe some other... You know him? Uh, yeah. Um, I'll see you tomorrow. Are you sure? I can... no. Yeah. You go ahead. Hey. What are you doing here? I, uh... I just, uh... How are you? Actually, I was sort of hoping that we could talk. There's nothing to talk about. Hannah, please. Please, I need to ask you something, ok? It's important. I need to ask for your forgiveness. You have no idea how much this has been eating me up inside all these years. I still think about what happened, about you, about what you had to... shut up! Just shut the...Up! You have no idea what I went through! Ok, then tell me. Hey. Just tell me. I was up all night, trying to figure out... I don't know. Something. Do you think I'm doing the right thing? It doesn't matter what I think or what Neal thinks or your dad. This is your decision. You got to do what you think is right for you. What's right... Mm-hmm. This should be the street. [Crowd chanting] Stop killing babies! Stop killing babies! I knew I shouldn't have let them get to me like that, but I was a different person back then. If you didn't go through with it, what did you do? I prayed. I begged to god to help me. I thought... Maybe... It wasn't murder if I miscarried, right? But he never did. He just wasn't there. Well, what's the worst thing they could do to you if you told them? They'd never forgive me. Are you sure about that? I'm not telling them. I can't. I just... Evening, ladies. Y'all got some car troubles? Um, no. We're just chilling. Yeah. Well, you got to be careful out here at night, watch out for the boogeyman. I like the earring on your lip. Thank you. Yeah. Hard to get, huh? What's wrong with your friend? She looks a little down in the dumps. Um, nothing is wrong with my friend. Oh...doesn't look like nothing. What's wrong, sweetie? Oh, come on. Your boyfriend dump you? Oh, come on, now. It can't be that bad. Why don't you tell the gardener? Maybe I could help. Hannah: Turns out he could help me. He gave me these pills, said they'd take care of my problem. Why didn't you come to me? I don't know! I don't know why I did anything! All I knew was that my parents couldn't find out. That is all I cared about. Don't! I can't! I can't. I...i have to go. [Engine starts] [Telephone rings] [Ring] Morning. [Ring] White residence. Hello? Ohh... What is going on? That is the third time today someone's called and hung up. You're resigning? Yeah. I'm afraid so, John. It's Lilly. She wants to move back to Oklahoma, be closer to her family, and I... Well, I feel like it's time that I moved on. You have another church lined up back there? No, no. I've decided to leave the ministry. Leave? Neal. You are the single best musical minister this church has ever had. Well, it's been a difficult decision, but I feel like it's the right one. Son...are you sure this is the direction that god is leading you? I'm sure. John, uh... Thank you... For everything that you've done for me and my family. I wish I were half the man you are. [Telephone rings] Hello. Finally you...answer. Zane? Yeah. I've been trying to call you forever. Your...dad won't ever let you talk. You're out of jail? You know they can't keep me locked up. Come on. Uh... You probably shouldn't be calling me here. But, babe, I'm dying to see you. I mean, you said in your letter that you were going to... I know. I know what I said. Look, I can't come back to Houston right now. You don't have to. I'm here. You were right. This town is a piss hole. What? Wait you're here? You mean you're in Trinity? Yeah. Can you meet me? Where? [Cartoon playing on television] Hey, blondie! I like it. Television: There's going to be a guy in it named pat Buchanan. [Telephone rings] [Ring] Hello. Is Hannah there? No. I'm sorry. She's already gone to work. This is Camille from the restaurant. She didn't show up tonight. What time was she scheduled to come in? Two hours ago. I was sort of worried because of that guy. What guy? When we left last night, there was this guy waiting for her in the parking lot. I could tell she was kind of freaked out about him being there, but she said she knew him. This guy...did he have a scruffy look, have tattoos? No tattoo. Drives a minivan. I've seen him in the restaurant before with his family. Got a bunch of kids. Ok. Thanks for calling. I'll make sure Hannah gets back in touch with you just as soon as she comes in. John. What's going on? I don't know, but i'm going to find out. [Door opens and closes] [Telephone rings] Hello. Lanette, this is Maxine. I have an urgent prayer request. Overlapping voices: Poor preacher and Ms. Maxine. Now, I heard she was his maid. You know, she went to the rectory every day... [Voices overlap] [Ring] [Beep] Hello. And this rainbow shall be a token of the covenant between me and... I just got a call from the prayer chain. Looks like Hannah has run off again. [Cellphone rings] Yeah. Maxine: I just got a call from the prayer chain. Hannah is here, at the motel. [Knock knock knock] Hello. This is the motel manager. I don't think anybody's in there. Can we make sure? Oh, my lord! Call the police. Uh! Ah! All right, Zane, it's confession time. Now, you tell me where my daughter is right now, or I swear to you, boy, I will rip your arm off! [Water splashes] Muffled male voice: Drowning in sin. Oh, my heavens! She's ok. She just passed out, I think. Let's get her upstairs to her bed! I'll get her a wet rag. Ok. John. I...i, um... I found her at church, in the baptistery. The baptistery? Here we go. Thank goodness you found her when you did. Yeah. As far as i'm concerned, John, nobody needs to know about this, ok? I mean, the last thing that I want to see is her in prison. She doesn't deserve that. You know... For the longest time, I've tried to figure out where it went wrong for Hannah. I mean, how could somebody change so suddenly? I guess I've always blamed it on the drugs. But now... I need to ask you something, Neal. Your leaving our church wouldn't have anything to do with my daughter, would it? Oh, John. Oh, Neal, why? Why?! You listen to me, ok? Just hear me out. I... I, um... I wish I had an explanation that would make this easier for you, but I, I... I don't. I never meant for any of this to happen. I loved her. No! Ilove her, Neal. I trusted you! You son of a... Uh! Caleb, Caleb, Caleb! Come here, son. No. No, son, no. That's not the way we do it. No. No, son. No, son. It's all right. You...you get out of my home! No, son. No, son. It's all right. It's all right, son. It's all right. This is a blow to our church family. We will not be disrupted in our choir practices, in our sunday services. We'll be able to get assistance from our sister churches and have somebody fill in for Neal on a temporary basis. Now... You thinking you should have left me in jail? I was, um, thinking about when you were little. You used to love to come in here. You'd sit at that piano all day long playing the same song over and over again. Drove me crazy. "This little light of mine." You remember that. It's the first song I ever learned. Neal resigned. He's leaving the ministry, going back to Oklahoma. [Crying] You got to let it go, sweetheart. Just let it go. I'm so sorry. Oh, shh. I thought I could protect you. I couldn't. I...i failed you. No. No. No. Please don't think that. You never gave up on me... Even after... Everything I put you through. Sweetie, I could never give up on you. You're my child. You're my little girl. You're a part of me. But I'm not you. I know. I...i know. [Sobbing] [Music playing] So are you back for good or just visiting? Just visiting. I got an internship lined up when I get back. That's cool. I always wonder what it would have been like if I'd gone to college. You could still go. There aren't many music schools around here. There's tons in New York. New York? Why not? I really missed you, rache. I did try to call. I know. I know, and I meant to call you back. It's just... it's all good. You don't got to explain. I get it. You know what's funny? I was supposed to be the good influence on you. What do you say we get out of here?
