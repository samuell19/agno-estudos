- Hey! - Now, that, there it is, uh, 35, goin' on, goin' on, $40, it's a whole, what, fair deal. Forty dollars. Come on, now, give me a 45, 45, anybody? Hey, right there, bidding is 45. Thank you, son, I appreciate it. Nice hairdo. All right, come on! Anybody got 50-- 55, 55... Fifty goin' once. Fifty goin' twice. Sold that hog for a $50 bid! Yes, sir, that's a good hunk of pork ya got there, mister. Fill that up with some onions and shrooms... Well, folks, uh, planting time is upon us. I'm sure y'all gonna be harnessin' up your donkeys, your oxen, your mules. and bustin' sod this spring. But I wanna show you somethin' real special tonight. It's a new item here at Bemus' Travelin' Auction. Now, hey, it's a pricey item, make no mistake. But somethin' like this could change your-- Yes, sir! Make it a whole lot easier. Now, the problem with a mule or a horse is that, even though they're strong, they're just so dang stupid! - I don't wanna be the butt, Shank. - Shut up, Ollie! You see what I mean? Strength, yeah. Brains, eh, not so much. - But what if you could have both? - Yeah. Bring 'em in, boys! Would ya look at that. Gentlemen, these are thoriphants. Just you look at that strong back, those legs... much stronger than any mule or ox. But this right here's the best part. What's your name, little feller? I said, what's your name, son? M-- Mosley. It can talk! Look! Look! You see what I mean? Very articulate. Now just imagine the possibilities. An animal stronger than what's pullin' your plow now... Mama, what's going on? ...but able to think. - Maybe even do chores around the farm. - Mama? You see, a... a thoriphant is a... creature you can treat like an animal, but depend on like a man. These animals are all the rage south of Enoch. And old Bemus has brought 'em to you special today! With a little help... from a friend of mine. We'll start the biddin' for this young feller here at $300. - Who'll give me three? - Oh, yeah! - There, $300 biddin' now, 325. - Oi! - Who'll give me 325? - Over here! Right there, 325. Who'll give me 30, 30, 30, 30-- All muscle and brain! Why, you're lookin' at-- Mama, what's happening? Come on! This thing can talk. Come on, 375 there-- Mama? Somebody give me $800. You! Right there it is, 800 going once... goin' twice... Sold to the gentleman for an $800 bid. Hey, right there you get 45, thank you, son, I appreciate-- Mama! Papa. Have a nice day, Mosley. I'll see ya later. Chickie, come here. Good morning, sir. Haya! Follow my tracks in the dust. Are you good chickie? You're a good chickie. Ugh. Get back with your sons. - I don't want my sons to see-- - Then why is your lanes too good-- Shank! Ollie! Don't you make me pull this wagon over, now. You're not a nice person. Would you look at that old hermit. How long has he been out here, Bemus? Since he lost Edna. Gentlemen and ladies, brats of all ages, it's Bemus' Travelin' Medicine Show, bringin' ya the finest linaments, ointments, elixers, and other health-related products. Bemus. Did you bring the seed I ordered? Yeah, but seeds don't pay the rent, slick, when times are hard. So if you give me half a minute here, I got to move some product. My gracious, son, look at you. You're covered in chigger bites. I mean to tell ya, it's somethin' awful. You scratch and you scratch until it start bleedin'. Whatever can be done? Is there no hope for the working man? Now that's why you need Bemus' Salve Ointment! Hey, Turpin. I haven't seen you in a while. - How's your leg? - Hello, Mosley. Oh, it's a little stiff. I manage, though. Papa, Papa, are you ready to go now? Are you ready to go now? - Come on, the ti-- Oh. - Shh. Sorry. I won't do it anymore, I promise. - Hello, Rue. - Mr. Turpin, guess what I found today. - Huh? - It's in the gullies. It's a cave. - A what? - It's in the gullies, in a cave! There's a slide in there, and I was like, whoa! And they all went down, and I was like, whoo! - Rue, now is not a good time. - Come on, Rue. Papa's working. Slashin' prices left and right! Somebody lock me up! All right, Bemus. You ain't just tryin' to sell me salve. Now why are you really here? Okay, okay, okay. He's why I'm here. This young'un's ready to go to auction, and it's big enough now, oh, is he-- - Oh, he's sort of big enough. - No! - Not-Not now, anyhow. - Aw, come on. - I'll make us a good prosperingin'. - No! - That's the thanks I get... - Inside, Rue. Unbelievable! You've gotta start thinkin' like a businessman, Simon. You know what? If I were you, I'd add Beggars Field over there to your property. Plant somethin' real quick, and-- and claim it as your own... before too many folks move out here from town, Simon. No. I don't know when I'd find the time. Time? What you ain't-- - That field's no good. - Mosley, no. - Uh, son, that's what you're gonna get - Sir? - if you don't-- - Huh? Uh, s-sorry, I didn't-- I don't mean to interrupt... You see, there's a reason no one's ever planted in that field. It's full of roots and stones, uh... What's this? Have you started taking advice from your animals now? Nobody asked you... Mosley. - Where you going, Papa? - Come on, Rue. Mosley? Come here, quick. The calf is moving. Wow! - He's active, isn't he? - He? - Could be a she. - Oh, yeah, it could be, but, I don't know, I've got a feeling - about this one. - Oh, a feeling, huh? All right. But that didn't work too well for you last time. It didn't? I thought I s-- I thought I said a boy last time. Nope. You said a girl. - I did? - Ah! The tower is falling down! Well, we got a boy all right. I've been lookin' forward to this all day. Papa, are you ready, are you now? Come on, let's go, big guy! Go where? My new hiding place in the gullies. Come on! Maybe another day, Rue, all right? - It's late. I'm tired. - Mosley. You oughta see this. - See what? - His hiding place. - What, now? - Yes. Why? This one sounds... different. Sounds different? All right, guys, look, I'm sore. I wanna go to bed. If I'm gonna plow that field tomorrow, at least I want a good night's sleep. Papa, do you know what I would do if I had hands? What did you say? If I had hands, do you know what I would do? Hands? Like Simon has 'em? Rue, what are you talking about? Mosley... you should see this. Over here, Papa, it's just over here! All right, I'm comin'. Lightning bugs? Great luck! Now we won't get lost in the darkness. - Woo-hoo! - Hey! Hold on, just slow down a little bit. Over here, Papa, it's just over here! ♪ Happy bugs, I love you You're so happy, I love you ♪ Hey, uh, does your mom know how far away you're going? And he's gone. Down here, Papa! It's down here! - Come on! - All right, I'm comin'. Gimme a minute. Hey, Papa! Oop. Hey, Papa. All right, Rue, where is this place? This is further out than I was planning to go. Come on! It's just over here! - Yahoo! - Rue! Oh, no. No, no, no, no. Rue! Rue! - Down here, Papa! It's fun! - Well, don't move! I'll b-- I'll be, uh... Huh? Oh, no! Whoa. Oh, my gosh, wh-- What is this? It's our new hiding place, Papa. And someone even drew on the walls. They're thoriphants, just like us, but they have hands. They walk upright. - Their backs, they're not bent. - And they have hands. They're so tall. And they have hands. And they have hands. Look at 'em. That one over there's playing a flute. And that one over there's smoking a pipe! Rue... - How far does this go? - Come on. I'll show you. Have you gone that far in? No. I waited to go 'til you'd go with me. It's too scary in the dark. Papa, are they real, or did someone just make them up? Hello, Mosley. You've been looking at my drawings again. I used to be better at it. The fewer teeth I have, the harder it is to hold the chalk. What are they, Mr. Turpin? They are what we used to be. Once there were two great families of thoriphants. One fled to the north to escape the evil of men. The other was left behind. We are the descendants of those who remained. And over time, under the oppression of men, we changed. Hands were of no use. We had strong backs... bent for labor. Well, why haven't they come for us? They don't know we're here. They thought they were the last thoriphants in the world, But some believe one day they will come back, marching through the fields to rescue us-- ten feet tall with massive arms. Time to work, you miserable animals. No. They're not real. It's just a cruel thing to hope for. Come on, Rue. Let's go home. - But Papa... - It's already late, son, and we need to get back. Yes, sir. Goodnight, Rue. Papa, do you know what I would do... if I had hands? No. What would you do? Well? Did you see it? It's a cave, Bera. It's not just a cave, Mosley. It's proof... proof that the Uprights really exist, that they could be out there somewhere. That cave could lead us to them. The Uprights are just a fairy tale. Well, don't you at least want to find out how far that cave goes? No, I don't. I... I have to work tomorrow. Hey, besides, didn't we agree not to tell Rue - any stories about Uprights? - I didn't tell him. He found them in the cave. - No! - I know at least four other farmers lookin' to buy a young calf like Rue. - No. - He's a full year older than Mosley was when I sold him to ya. You're just not thinkin' like a businessman, Simon. Okay, Bemus. Once the new calf is born, you can take Rue. Whoo! Yes, siree! I'll drink to that. - Hoo! - Mosley. Please, do something. I will. I'll talk to Simon tomorrow. - I think that-- - Talk?! You heard what they said. You've got time to go, find out, and then come back. What, the cave again? No! I'm not going back out there to chase a fairy tale. I would go... but I can't. - Oh, you would go? - Yes, I would. - Bera... - I would run, and run, and not stop until I found them. Mosley, if we don't take a chance now... Come on, Mosley! Come on, pull! Aw, come on, pull! Pull! You're ignorant, stupid animal! Come on! ♪ You are so great I'll dance and - ♪ All the glory I would see ♪ - I'm just talkin' about scratch right there. Reach down there and scratch it good... Oh, right there. Okay. Mr. Turpin, Good morning, Rue. Do you know what I would do if I had hands? - What? - Hands! Do you know what I would do?! Uh, my gosh, back is a mess. Up, boys. We got some salve to sell. - Pull! - Hmm? Come on, pull! What's goin' on? Uh-oh. Pull! That field is bad, ain't it? - Pull! - And it's what his thoriphant said. Quit fooling around. Don't get wacky. Go, go, go! Pull! Pull! Mosley! Pull! Oh. Go, go, go! Come on! Come on! Let's go, you two! - Bemus! - Is he comin' this way? - Yeah, he's comin' this way, Bemus. - Bemus! Yeah, yeah, wai-wai-wait a minute, Simon. I didn't say it would be easy. - My plow split! - What split, the blades? - Papa... - No! This thing stopped the blade by force! How's that... I love my wagon, there. I've been all the way down... I would run, and run, and not stop until I found them. What? What's he doin'? - Papa! - Rue... I'm gonna go back to that cave Are you gonna go find the Uprights? Yes. And I need you to stay here, Rue. I need you to be like Papa until I come home. That means you have to take care of Mama, do all the chores. Can you do that for me? Yes, Papa. And Rue... Tell your mother she was right. She was right about everything. Aw, he's just talkin' to his boy. No, no... somethin's up. Mosley? Mosley! Come on, boys, go, go! Come on! Go! Woo-hoo! Yahoo! - Go, go, go! - Mosley! Mosley! Mama! Come on! Goldurn piece of horse dukey. - Come on, boy, hoof it! - I'm comin', Shank! Mosley! Mosley! Mosley! Come on, now! We-- We've been together all these years. Don't-- Don't do this, Mosley. I'd, I'll... I'm... I'm gonna walk fast to walk two miles to go around your farm to come and go to town so I don't have to look at you. It's like you've got a rump roast between your ears. Mosley! Obviously he ain't here. But ya gotta keep your head. Now is not the time for a hissy fit. You. Where did he go? I don't know. I'm lockin' the door tonight. Mama, is Papa in trouble? Hey, you know, all this gives me an idea. An idea? An idea?! Come on now, Simon. - Don't get all moody on me. - Get off my farm! - What? Simon... - Get off, now! Listen to me for a minute, will ya? For a small fee, I could guarantee the return of your animal. If ya don't get 'im back, you pay nothin'! You can't lose! I'll pack, Bemus. Can we please leave now? Yeah, but we're comin' back tomorrow. - Huh? - Why? We're gonna go get Warfield. Warfield? Are you serious? Oh, yeah... serious as a heart attack. ♪ I'll be faithful and true ♪ Come on, Turpin, get it up! Is that Bemus? Yes, it is. - Now, settle down, settle down. - Bemus! - I'm gonna get you, Bemus! - Settle down. I'd be ashamed raisin' such a fuss over a bottle of beauty cream. It don't work, Bemus. It don't do nothin'! I'm a scientist, ma'am, I'm not a magician. I used Bemus' Salve on a wart on my head. And now look at it! Point that thing somewhere else, will you please? Is he in? He just finished a job, Bemus. No, no... no. I got another one for 'im. No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no. No, don't. Don't go. No, don't, don't, don't... No, don't. Don't go. No, no, no... No, no, no, don't go, don't go, don't go... Are you okay? Don't go! What? What are you talking about? There were sinkholes... north of town. - I found caves. - What? Caves... - with Upright drawings. - Uprights? D-- D-- D-- Don't go! It's... It's a trap! Whoa! We got 'im! - We got 'im, Simon! - We got 'im! We're here! - Papa. - Hmm? We got the thing in, and brought him all the way home. I told ya I'd get your animal back. He's as good as got. There here's Warfield. He's a tracker, a hunter... catches thoriphants no matter how far they run. I'll pay 350. His name is Mosley. And I want him back unharmed. Y-You unders-- You understand me? Hey! Don't you wanna know which direction he went? Rue? Rue! Rue! Rue! - Oh-ho! Look-a there! - Rue! No! I'll get him. Let go! Let me go! Let go! - Rue. - Mr. Turpin, what's he going to do to my Papa? I don't know. But we need to get you back now, okay? You listen to me now. You need to think of your mother. The calf will be coming soon. You have to be strong for her. You know, they say he ain't just catchin' runaways these days. They say he's layin' traps for 'em, too. Traps? - Where? - I don't know. But I want a cut of that action. Well, would you look at that? - Come on. Ollie, come on! - I don't know about this, Shank. So... they really don't exist, do they? You're going back to Simon. But first... I get a souvenir. Wow! Look at that one. Look! Lookit here. Who knew this was down here? A thoriphant, walkin' around like people... just like a little kid's nursery rhyme or somethin'. Shank, let's get outta here. - I don't like this place. - Oh, what are you scared of, Ollie? You think one of them's gonna jump up and grab you? Stop it, Shank, that ain't funny. Man, Warfield must have painted all of this to lure them thoriphants in here. I just didn't think he was the artistic type. Well, his secret's out. He's gonna have to split the take now. No, Shank, no! No! No, no, no, no! No! Shank! No! No! - Huh? - Huh? Stop foamin' in the mouth... Aah, don't worry, Simon, I'm not stayin' long... just until Warfield gets back and I collect my 10%. Don't you ever scare me like that again, Rue. But Mama, I was just gonna stop him a little bit. I can't go after you. The calf is getting too big. - But I can be brave, Mama, I can. - Rue, I... Ooh. Ah, that's better. Rue... I will tell you when you need to be brave, okay? But you have a little brother... or a sister that will be coming. And remember... you need to be like Papa until he comes home. Okay? All right, Mama. Galin! What? Galin! Galin! Galin. Oh, this-- this is, this is your fault. Oh, he's gotta be around here somewhere. - I mean, how far could he go? - You shouldn't have left them! I didn't leave them, Warnie, I was just resting my eyes! Resting your eyes means you were sleeping on the job. - I wasn't! - Aww. - They're real. - Galin? They're really real. I can't believe it. Look at the baby. Coochy-coochy-coochy-coo. Are you an Upright? Are there more like you? Is-- Is there a city like they always said, a real city with really real Uprights just like you? You're so troubled, little baby. - Where's he gone? - Shh. Do you hear that? - Whoa, whoa! Whoa! - Get it off! Hey! - Whoa! - Hah! - Sorry! Sorry! - Get off him! Get off him. - I'm sorry, I-- - What are you? I'm-I-- I'm-- I'm Mosley. - He's a thoriphant! - He's not a thoriphant! - Get back! - I don't want any trouble. I was just-- What are you doing here? What's your name? I'm M-M-Mosley. - Get back! - Are you Uprights? - Get... back! - Just like in all the stories. You've gotta help me. My family, I've left them... - What a... - Hey, hey, hey... hey! - Why are you naked? - Na-- Naked? - I, I, I... I... - Stand up! - I am, I'm... - Stand up! - Warnie! Warnie... - Stand... up! He... He is standing up. Um... Right! Uh, well, um... Introductions are probably necessary at this point. - Mmm. - My name is Warnie, and this is Deaver. - He's my brother. - Hello! We are elders in our community. And who's he? - Er, uh... - Oh, that's Galin. You have to forgive him. His... His mind is not what it used to be. Yes, one sandwich short of a picnic. What's he doing? Well, actually, I think he's talking to that drawing. He probably thinks it's one of his relatives. Galin is the only one left. He is the only one who remembers living in this place, long ago, before the Migration. Well, we didn't think there were any thoriphants left in this part of the world. Are they... all like you? - Like me? - Uh, four feet! No hands. That can't be very convenient. Yeah, it's convenient for some people. My master. - A man? - It was because of men that our ancestors fled this part of the world - centuries ago. - But why did you come all the way back? Old Galin. Deaver and I are getting up in years, but Galin is older than the both of us put together. And his mind is fading. I think he can hear us. But senility has somehow endowed him with an unusual power. He sees visions. - Visions? - Eh, usually nothing of consequence, but they are amazing, nonetheless. This time he's dreamed of fireflies. - Fireflies? - Yes... leading him back to this part of the world. - We didn't know why at first. - Well, I could tell you why. This is no accident. Fireflies led me here, too. - What? - Yes! - Fireflies? - Two great families of thoriphants. That's what I was told when I was young. One escaped the tyranny of men. - The other perished! - No! When your ancestors left, ours stayed behind and we changed... backs bent for work... no hands. Unbelievable. Do you see what's happening here? Our meeting is the fulfillment of a prophecy, - the Uprights coming to rescue us. - Now just wait a minute. We'll go back to your city. - We'll get your army. - Oh, army. Mosley, it's not as simple as that. - You see, in Kineserath-- - No! No, Deaver. Maybe we can help Mosley. We can? We can. Okay, time to be like Papa. Nope. Just great. This is amazing. Whoo! Wow! Hey, wait up, guys! - Uh... - Hand. Oh, if only Rue were here to see this. I-- I bet your army uses their hands to, like, fight! They'll hold weapons and stuff? And-- And make big fists to, like, smash things. Uh, their fists are very smashy, yes, yes. Uh, you know what the best thing about hands is? - No, what? - Fingers! Oh! - Why's that? - Well, a hand without fingers is like having no hand at all. Each finger has its own job. - Now, the little finger... - Oh. is sort of a decorative number, really. It doesn't really do much, - but is quite cute. - Oh. Now, this finger is my ring finger, because you can place a ring on this one. And you'd be like a royal king. Hello. Hello, my subjects. But the next two are the most important fingers. They work with Mr. Thumb. Look at him! Look at Mr. Thumb! Hey, where's my lackies? Here we are. These three work together to do wonderful things. - Like, like what? - Yes, yes, like what? I am breathless with anticipation. Like maybe... pick your nose! You couldn't resist that, could you? Showing off, being disgusting... one hundred and four years old, and he still acts like a little bubba. - I do not! - Yes, you do! - With knobs on it. - Oh, unrealistic. - Don't let him fool you, Mosley. - Huh? He's done it, you know, I've seen him. Ah, yep, they're right up there... right up there. Oh, just wait 'til Rue meets you guys. You have to show him how you pick your nose. Oh, that's easy. And how 'bout this? - Oh. - And, look at this. Amazing. Snap, clap, crack knuckles... it's all part of the package. And wh-what if-- What if you have an itch on your back or something? An itch? Uh, well, uh... I would... Oh. That feels pretty good. Whoa! I gotta get a turn in. The itchies. Sratchy-scratch. - Oh, that's good. - Down here? Huh? Sheesh, thanks, guys, I... Nobody's ever done that for me before. Um... here-- here, Galin. Oh, no, no, no. Well... It looks as if Galin prefers you to his walking stick, Mosley. You've made a friend. Do you mind? I'm afraid Galin's a bit slow on the trail. No, no, it's fine. It's my pleasure. Oh, look at this. Why, you can take them off? No. No. See, it's-- - It's just a trick. - Oh. Oh. What's this? This is the Great Orchard. Kineserath lies on the other side. - Well, then we go through it, right? - No, no. We go around it. - Around it? - It's haunted. Haunted. Really? Oh, yes. They say that the world actually began here, in this very spot. Well, what happened to it? The Great Corruption-- a curse that started here and spread over all living things... perhaps even bending the backs of your ancestors, Mosley. There's nothing in there now... only decay and ruin. - And ghosts. - Huh? Well, a spirit, to be sure, guarding the one viable tree that is left in the Orchard. Thoriphants go in... - But they never come out. - Return. "Ret"-- It's "return" is what I was gonna go with. I was gonna say, out... - Wait a minute... - You're out! Hey! Follow me, I see something. I don't think this is a good idea. Well, going under the orchard isn't the same as going in, Warnie. Perhaps the spirit won't mind. The map doesn't tell us much. - It may have been a shortcut once, but now-- - Oh, Warnie, why is it that evertime somebody else has an idea, you become so... - Guys? - Ipse dipso facto. - I've had enough warning! That's it! - Guys! Listen, I'm in a bit of a hurry here. I need that army of yours. and this is really a shortcut. All right, all right, then. We'll go under. But cautiously. Deaver, you go first. Are you tired, Galin? Do you need to sit down? Hello. Oh, my, you're a stern-looking fellow. Would you like a grape? Hmm? This doesn't feel right to me. Oh! And did it feel right for you to tell Mosley - a whopper like you did? - What? - What are you talking about? - You lied to him. - I didn't lie to him. - Well, you didn't not lie to him. Ah! What does that even mean? - Raining trees, you say? - All right. I think your rock friend is fine, okay? Hey, you're ready to go? I was just waiting for the right time to tell him. Now seems like a pretty good time. - Stop touching me! - Oh! Stop touching you... like this? - Huh?! Uh-oh... - Oh. He says you shouldn't have come here. Deaver, are you all right? Climb, Deaver, climb! Mosley, get Galin out of there! - Go! - Yeah, yeah, yeah, we'll get out! Galin, we gotta get you out of here. This way. - Oh! - Which way do we go? Galin, come on! We gotta go! - Ah. - Let's go! Whoa! Come on! - Hurry, Mosley! - Mosley, Mosley! Definitely not a short-cut. Galin! - Galin! - Galin, come on! That'll teach you, hmm?! Well, that could have been a shortcut. You knew that there was a very grumpy... something in there. Oh, it's grumpy, all right. Well, you needn't bother about us! We'll go around! Grape? Okay, you stay out of the way for safety. A little guy like you could get drowned if you're not careful, and you won't have that fuzzy feel anymore. Yeah. Whoa. Whoa, whoa! Ow! Ow! Ooh! Let's try it again! Let's try this one more time. It's an eye there, and the thumb is the ear. Look at this! Look! It's a... What's that? Mmm, I still don't-- Not sure what I'm seein', all right? I don't know. I've got no idea what that is, either. Well! We lost a lot of time today with shortcuts and vengeful spirits It's a wonder we didn't get ourselves killed! I know, I know, I... I mean, how could any of have known it was gonna suddenly start... raining trees? Well... somebody knew. - Mosley. - Hmm? What's in here? What? Oh. Yeah. Uh... I can't stop thinkin' about Bera and Rue. I've been gone a long time. They-- They might not think I'm coming home. But it'll all be worth it, right? I mean... Imagine the look on Rue's face when I come home with an army. - Ah! - Ah! Ah. Yeah, I've suddenly got a craving for a muffin. - Muffins! - Does anyone fancy a mu-- a mu-muffin? - Yes. Muffin. - Yes. - Muffin time! Mmm. - Muffin, muffin, yes! I think I've got some muffins in here. Yeah. I'm so hungry. Hm. Wonderful. Mmm. Mosley, tell us about children. Yes, yeah, tell us about Rue. Rue? Oh. He's the greatest kid-- adventurous. He's into everything. I mean, d-- ya know, how kids are, right? - Ah. Ah! - Mmm. Yes. Yes, clearly. Ya know, I-I bet even probably right now, he's pokin' around somewhere he doesn't belong. Ooh. Wow! Hmm. Huh? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! I haven't got a piece of cake. Rue? What are you doing out so late? Uprights! Are these pictures of Uprights? Why, yes, they are, heh. Rue, how do you know about the Uprights? Me and Pop saw some paintings once. But he said they were fake. But then, he went to go look for 'em. So maybe they're not fake. Oh, heh, maybe they're not. Will they ever come to rescue us? There's an old verse that says: "Through the fields one summer day "We'll see the Uprights come, "Posture straight and massive hands, "That dwarf the size of any man's. "Removing yoke and chain and bands, "Our toil will then be done." I can't wait. Hmm? Galin? Hey! Huh? - Warnie, Deaver. - What is it? Look. Galin! No, it'll just be his overactive bladder. Galin! Galin! - Wake up! - He is awake, Deaver. He may be having a vision. Let's just see where he goes. - Ah! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! - Galin! Stop! This is as far as we go, Galin. Wait a minute! Are you okay, Galin? Are you having a dream? Wait a minute now, come on! Come on! Time to wake up! - Galin! Time to wake up! - Galin, please... wakey-wakey now. Oh, please! Wake up, old man! Wake up! Rise and shine. Galin, please! It's not fair. - Don't dare call me--! - Yeah, guys? - Galin, let's--! - Ouch! - Hey, guys! - What, what, what?! I think you should lower your voices. Why? What's wrong? - Uh, there may be a hunter after me. - What? - A hunter? - A man hunter? And we're leading him back to our city? I didn't think to tell you before, but, it's like... Say, who c-- Who's that? - The hunter. - Mosley! Stay with Galin! Galin, stop! Whoa! Whoa, oh! - You, distract! - Me, district? I'll ambush! Your entire life has been a distraction. Look at me, the distraction! What do we do? We're trapped! Believe, Mosley. What are you doing? They are leading us. Leading us? Wait... is this like the raining trees? Nanny nanny boo-boo! Look at me! Distracting! Oh, boy. Oh, look! Mosley, stop! Come on, guys! Hurry up! Ha! Go! You could lose some weight, you know. Oh, no, no! Oh, look... look! Look, Deaver. - I'm alive, I'm alive! - Hey, hey! - Mosley. - Huh? Look. That's it? That's Kineserath? Hmm. - Look at that! - We could be the first flying thoriphants. Well, it sure beats walking. Those weren't just fireflies, Mosley. - No. - What are they? I... I'm not sure. Then how did you know? We gotta keep movin'. You sure make it look easy, Mr. Turpin. Well, Rue, the secret is to keep your head up and your eyes out front. - Like this? - There you go. It's so heavy. But I didn't spill any this time. The more you practice, the stronger you'll get. She sleeps all the time now. Yes, it won't be long. Hey! Soon you'll have a brother... or sister. But don't worry. I'll be here when the baby comes. Ooh. Warnie! We're close, Warnie, we-- we need to tell him. - Did we make it? Are we there? - Uh... yes, but... - Mosley! Wait! - Galin! - There, are you happy? - I was going to tell him. Well, it's too late now! The city of Uprights. Bera, Rue, we made it. We made it! Whoo! Mosley! Ha, ha-ha! This is amazing! Hello! - Nice to meet you! - A thoriphant? Hey! Hey! Hello! Oop, sorry about that. Sorry. Thoriphants living in houses! Hey! How ya doin'? It's nice to meet you! - And it's nice to meet you, too. - Huh? Hi! Hi, everybody! I made it! Huh? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute, what...? - Huh? - What's going on here? This can't be everybody. What's wrong with that boy? Where's the army? - Mosley. Mosley! - It's just Warnie, sir. I'm so sorry. Mosley! Warnie, why is...? - Why is everyone so...? - Old. I'm so sorry, Mosley. - I was going to tell you. - You lied to me? Why? Why would you lead me all the way out here t... just for this?! We have our own burdens in Kineserath. Oh, you seem to be doing just fine to me. We are dying, Mosley. - Dying? - Yes. There hasn't been a child born to us in over a hundred years. Deaver and I are the youngest in the city. Soon there won't be any of us left. But extinction isn't the worst part. What are you talking about? I'm talking about devolution. The curse on this world doesn't just want to kill us. It wants to bend us... to make thoriphants less and less of what we were intended to be. Look at you, Mosley! Your back is already bent! You don't have any hands! But you are in danger of losing something far more important, something in here. All your life you've thought of yourself as an animal-- some man's property. But you know there's something noble inside of you, something worth fighting for. We had to bring you back. - And now, maybe together, we can-- - I'm sorry, I... I can't stay. My family's waiting for me. I g-- I gotta go home. Give me one more day. I have to report to our queen. Look around you, Mosley. These are your brothers, and your sisters. We, too, are your family. Don't count us out just yet. Pardon me for disturbin' y'all, but I-- but I got a message for ya here, Bemus. - Oh, go ahead. - Well, ya see, Red sent me out here to tell ya that he'd buy that old thoriphant from ya. - Huh? - Use him to stamp mortar in Enoch. Yes, sir. Hoo! We'll ride back together. Turpin, come on, boy, we're headin' back in. What? - What does he mean? - I think I just got sold. - I'm sorry, Rue. - Turp! Come on! Let's go! But you can't go. You can't. Shh. Now you remember: Be like Papa, until he comes home, right? All right, Turp, let's get goin'. Actually, he's-- he's a very punctual animal. Mr. Turpin, it is all true, isn't it? I mean, about the Uprights? Rue, if you truly believe, - in your heart-- - That's not good enough, Mr. Turpin. It has to be really real... not just in my heart. Get it up! Come on, Turpin, let's go! I'm sorry. I don't know. I don't know what's keepin' Warfield, Simon, but I'll check back with ya sometime, you know me. I go where the profit is. But hey! I'll be back to pick up that young fella for the auction. It's his time, Simon. And that'll make us both a good profit. You know me! You-- Up and down ya go. It's the Orchard. Our ancestors built the city here long ago... hoping one day to see the Orchard bloom again. Mosley. Oh, Mosley, if I had but known that our brothers past the falls were suffering so... I would not have let myself... waste away like this for so many years! We stand with you, Mosley. We were hoping you'd say that. We've made swords! And some of them are pretty sharp, too. Mosley! - Mosley! Mosley! - No! - Mosley! Mosley! Mosley! - Wait! Everybody! Wait! Wait! I can't let you do this. - There's no way. - But Mosley... we want to. - But you can't! - Why not? Warnie! Oh, no! Warnie... Deaver, come quickly! What do we do? - Follow me! - Yes, yes! How'd ya like the point here of this, eh? - Quickly, quickly! - This way, come on. What do you want, hunter? Have you come for Mosley? Is that it, eh? Well, you can't have him! Leave! Leave at once! Galin? Galin, no! Galin! Oh, Galin! Help me! Help me get him outta here! Put him on my back! Go on! Get him! Galin. Galin, don't do this. Do you... - Do you see the... - See what, Galin? the... fireflies? He's gone. Galin. Mosley, no, no! - Wait, Mosley! - I'm sick of running from this man. All tog-- together we can-- No. You're too old, Warnie. He'll pick off every one of you and you know it. Your family... you've got to think of them. I am thinking of them. I'm thinking of all of you. - Fireflies. - What? - I'll lead him in there. - The Orchard? Mosley, you know whatever's in there doesn't take kindly to strangers. And you'll be lost... or killed! Deaver, I need you to get them to a safe place, all right? Hey, where you going? Deaver, what should we do? No! Push me! There we go. He's coming. You better make yourselves scarce. Mosley... of all the thoriphants I've ever known, you are the most upright. Upright! That's it! Mosley, there is one living tree hidden in the Orchard. If you could find it, eat its fruit. What would happen? The corruption would be reversed in you. But remember, Mosley, The Orchard Spirit guards his treasure violently. What's wrong? It's a full moon. No. Rue, honey... something's wrong. Now, I need you to go and get Simon, okay? - No, Mama. No! I can't! - Rue... Rue, listen to me! Remember when I said that I would tell you when you needed to be brave? - You remember that? - Mm-hmm. Well, I need you to be brave now. Go, Rue, go! Be like Papa. Be like Papa. Simon? Mr. Simon? My mama is having trouble with the baby. Hey! You wanna hunt me? Well, come on! Hunt me! Oh, boy. - Fireflies. - You think you're going to lose me in here? You might as well have the plow on your back. Sheesh. You won't survive the next one. There's not gonna be a next one. I have a family. I don't care. The Orchard has devoured him. No, no! - Deaver! No! - I will not lose another friend today! So it was you... all the time. Lightning bugs? Believe, Mosley. What do you want, Mosley? I want my family to be free. Mama? Mama. Mama! - Oh. - It's going to be okay, Mama. I'm going to be okay. I'll always love you, Rue. And your dad... would be so proud of you. I have to go away now, Rosie. Take care of my chick for me. And most importantly... take care of Mama. Now come on, little fella. It's good doin' business with ya, Simon. You won't regret it! ♪ Here we go... ♪ Come on, now, girl. Come on now, we're movin' on. Hey! Hey, Bera, what's this? Get on, now! Come on now, move! Hey! Mosley? Papa! - Mosley. - Simon. I'm taking my family... and I'm leaving. And if you know what's best for you... Simon... But Mosley... Mosley. What...? What's happened to you? I found them, Bera. I found so much. - Papa! - Rue! Rue! Rue! Rue. Do you know what I would do if I had hands? Papa. Hey. Huh? Hey, you! Aw, come here, come here! Come here. Look at you. - Oh, she's a girl. - Of course she's a girl. You had a feeling it was gonna be a boy so it had to be a girl. Hey, wait a minute. I have something. I have something for each of you. Oh, my goodness. Bera. - Rue. - Papa. You know what the best thing is about hands? Fingers. Boop! Come here. Let me show ya. Pa pa. Come on. Hey.
