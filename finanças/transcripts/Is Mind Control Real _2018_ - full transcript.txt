The notion that our minds have secret, untapped mental powers is one of the most enduring of human ideas. From spoon-bending to mind control, we are fascinated by people who claim they can alter the outside world with only their thoughts. But is it all just wishful thinking? Or is there a scientific truth to these stories? I need to know. My father was a scientist running a top secret government project. One night in his lab, an experiment went horribly wrong, rendering him invisible. Fearing he was disappearing forever, he rushed home to see my mother. And nine months later, I was born. My life's mission is to investigate concepts on the fringe of science, conducting experiments to test those claims regardless of taboo or seeming unprovability, searching for the clues that will make me visible. I walk on the edge of science. I am Mister Tachyon. There are people out there who claim to be able to move objects using only the power of their mind. Most are imposters, but I recently found someone who seems different. Telekinesis is the movement of an object over a distance without it being physically manipulated. One day I was watching a program online about a woman who had come back from a near-death experience, and she discovered that she was able to move objects with her mind. And I was so inspired by that video that I wanted to explore that notion for myself. I got a piece of glass one day, and I wanted to cover the piece of tin foil that I was using, 'cause that's a typical piece of equipment people use, just tin foil balanced on a needle. And I put my hands on the glass and looked at this tin foil for about two-and-a-half months. And eventually one day, it started moving. And today, I could sit several feet away, or stand even farther way, look at this object, and watch it turn. The glass, though it was a way to challenge myself, was also an expression of my own doubt. I needed to prove to myself, I needed to know that I wasn't fooling myself in doing this experiment. Every time I do telekinesis, I prove to myself again that it's real and I can do it. Sean appears to move the foil at will and from several different positions, and also in opposite directions. How could this be possible? I need to come up with an experiment to test this. Sean is far from alone in claiming to have the power of mind over matter, and there is one man who has tried to prove it with science: a controversial Japanese researcher named Masaru Emoto. An independent researcher, Emoto achieved worldwide fame when he claimed to have discovered a new power of the human mind. And in an experiment that remains popular online today, Emoto placed rice in identical jars with different labels: one with a positive word like "love", the other with a negative word like "hate". It's time to set up some experiments. For telekinesis, the hypothesis is that Sean will be able to move an object with only the power of his intention. I've set up this equipment to match Sean's. The same glass container, the same foil, pin, and eraser. For my control, I'm going to leave the equipment alone to test for random movement with no mental or apparent physical manipulation. My rice experiment will be rigorously scientific. I will sterilize and fill all the jars at the same time to minimize the difference in the amount of bacteria between the jars. My hypothesis, based on Emoto's experiments, is that after 30 days we should see less decay in the love jar than either the control or the hate jars. With the rice secure, I check on the footage from my telekinesis control. The foil has not moved. Interesting. I need to set up my active experiment. During his demonstration, Sean held the jar for almost 7 minutes before the foil started moving. Could the heat from his hands be changing conditions inside the container? To find out, I try to warm up the glass with my own hands. I keep them in place for 7 minutes like Sean did, but nothing happens. Sean is a very experienced meditator. Is he able to warm up his hands to a higher than average temperature? To test this idea, I place a heat pack around the container. Within seconds, the foil starts to move. Introducing a change in temperature may create a current inside the glasss. This change may be enough to move something as light as the tin foil, but it's not moving the same as Sean's. And when I remove the heat pack, I get another surprise: the foil stops moving immediately. Sean seemed able to keep the foil spinning for several minutes, even when he was several feet away. With my first experiment, the introduction of heat created some movement of the foil. Even then, the effect was inconsistent. This only gave me more questions. I still don't have an accurate idea as to how Sean was able to move the foil the way that he did... but I think I know where to start looking. I'm searching for proof that our minds have an untapped power, that our thoughts can impact the material world. I've come to San Francisco to follow up on an interesting concept I discovered online. It teases a new app called Entangled, which in theory can test for extraordinary mental powers. I track down its creator, tech entrepreneur Adam Curry, at a hacker den where his team is putting the final touches on their code. We're in a place called Noisebridge right now, which is ground zero sort of for the San Francisco hacker culture. You've been working on an app. The app is called Entangled. It's a hack of consciousness and the fabric of reality, and how those two might intersect and how we might be able to explore that intersection. Right now in science and philosophy of mind, these disciplines, there's kind of a revolution taking place, and that revolution is around trying to figure out what consciousness is. The kind of mainstream materialist perspective on consciousness is that it's kind of an illusion, that it's not a real thing, that it's an epiphenomena of chemical reactions in the brain. But there's an alternative perspective that it's a fundamental part of the nature of physical reality. So the app is actually designed to explore the possibility that that latter case might be true. So this app will allow people to affect their phones with their thoughts? We're basing the app on a couple of decades of research that shows that chaotic systems like random number generators can behave differently when human consciousness is interacting with it. So imagine an electronic coin flipper that s flipping heads, tails, heads, tails, heads, tails, but many times a second. If you collect enough of these heads and tails, you should have a equal number of heads to tails. Right. This 50/50 balance can be skewed in the direction of a person s intention just by their intending to think, you know, more ones or more zeroes, or in this case more heads or more tails. The PEAR Lab at Princeton popularized the use of the quantum random number generator to explore the mind/matter interaction relationships. In 1979, the Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research Institute was born. For almost three decades, researchers explored the idea that intense concentration or emotions could affect random number generators and stop them from being random. Plagued with controversy and repeatedly attacked from other scientists, the institute shut down in 2007, but not before they launched a spin-off project that placed 70 random number generators around the world. The scientists behind the project predicted global events would stop the generators from behaving randomly. The first results came in after the terrorist attacks on 9/11, when a strange pattern emerged. Shortly after the first hit on the World Trade Center, the data from these generators started to spike. The numbers on the generators grew less random as the world became aware of the attacks, and it stayed remarkably elevated for days afterwards. Is this proof of global consciousness, or just an anomaly? It's a question Adam is trying to solve. So essentially what Entangled is is a version 2.0 of the Global Consciousness Project, where instead of 70, we could have hundreds of thousands or millions. And if you put this app in millions of people's hands... We might be able to see these kind of spikes in the data, or moments when it's not behaving chaotically, when it's behaving less randomly, that correlate to things that are affecting mass consciousness, right? So big events, mass meditations... It's funny that we know more about outer space than we do inner space, right. So consciousness is I think the question that our society is going to need to try to get to the bottom of in the next century. Adam's app still needs beta testing before it can roll out worldwide, but I'm excited to experiment with it once it's completed. While I'm still searching for more evidence that our minds can affect solid matter, I m now intrigued by the idea of our minds interacting with matter at a quantum mechanical level. Maybe this is where our hidden powers of mind over matter truly lie. That is certainly what Masuru Emoto thought he had proven with his second major experiment, this time with water. Emoto believed that all life was a combination of energetic vibrations. With the proper resonance, he believed vibrations could produce tangible objects. He also believed that non-resonant vibrations produced destructive energy. His experiment was very simple. He had volunteers focus positive energy on water, and then froze it to see if symmetrical crystals formed. He then had volunteers focus negative energy on water to see if they formed chaotic structures when frozen. I decided to run my own experiment to test Emoto's water theory, and have asked meditator Jesse Buck to help. Describe for me how you'll do this. So I'll be sitting down, tuning into myself, tuning into my breath, kinda quieting everything else around me, and trying my best to fill myself up with the feeling of love, and hope that that transmutes to this water. My active for this experiment will have Jesse channelling both positive and negative energy onto separate containers of water. Jesse begins the experiment by channelling love. If you send the intention of love into water, what could we expect to happen to it? We could expect to see sacred geometry develop within this water. So ice crystals that are more symmetrical? Absolutely. What should sending hate into the water do? Well, I would expect that water would not be crystalizing into something that would be a shape. It would probably be something more of a blob. Jesse has clearly given everything with his meditation, but have his positive and negative intentions fundamentally changed the structure of water? There's only one way for me to find out. I'm experimenting with the idea that love and hate can change the structure of water, and cause it to form symmetric or asymmetric ice crystals. To find out if it's true, I'll create a device to produce ice crystals in my lab. Ordinarily, ice crystals form around pieces of dust floating in our atmosphere when the temperature is low enough. Dry ice is -78.5 degrees, more than enough to freeze our water crystals in midair. The other component needed to make ice crystals is something for them to form around, like this piece of string. The water infused with love will go in this container. The water infused with hate will go in this one. First, the love. I'm pouring the water into this sponge. Inserting the sponges into our jars will create condensation. Next, I place the jars into my coolers, and this should produce the crystals we need from the condensed water. Emoto's hypothesis predicts that the good-intentioned water will form more symmetrical crystals than the water infused with hate. Jesse's energetic meditation has me excited about the potential for this experiment. I follow up on an intriguing new idea that emerged during Jesse's session. After he completed his hate meditation, Jesse mentions something I found very interesting. I could feel instantaneously, when I started to say these mean things to the water, I was like feeling really sad that I had to do it, and I would just be experiencing the sadness of anger. So it was quite a moving experience. The profound emotions that his hate meditation produced have led me down a different line of thought. Jesse's dark meditation absolutely had in impact within him. Are internal effects the path to discovering the true power of our mind? In search for answers to this question, I track down meditation expert Ellie Weisbaum, who has taught meditation around the world, including the headquarters of the World Bank and Google. So I thought we could start by listening to a few sounds of the bell, just as a way to kind of fully arrive in the space together. Breathing in, I invite my mind and body to fully arrive in the present moment. Breathing out, I touch the qualities that make this a wonderful moment. That was so simple, but I felt like my whole body had changed, and I just felt so calm. Yeah, and that's-- you know, it's really interesting. Sometimes when we do a meditation, we wind up feeling relaxed. You know, it's been shown through the research to have benefits like reducing anxiety, increasing sense of well-being, so it sounds like you touched some of those. So you think meditation can change our minds and bodies? Our brains are always wiring. So this idea of neuroplasticity is the concept that our brains can actually change. To discover the many different ways meditation can change our minds, Ellie invites me to a flash mob meditation she s organized. I asked a few of the meditators about their journey into the mind s power. How has meditation helped you? I have asthma, I grew up with it. Like I was hooked up to a machine when I was a baby until I could learn how to take puffers on my own. When I've had asthma attacks and stuff, there's been times where I've had to force myself into a mindful state to control my breathing. I took it for pain management, and it was prescribed by my doctor. And I was stunned because my level of pain had not changed, but my attitude towards it had completely changed! Is the mind capable of changing the body? I believe so. In our monastery in Southern California, it gets quite hot. You know, it's partially desert. And I can sit in meditation and feel perfectly cool. These conversations have deepened my thoughts on the mind's ability to impact one's own body. Is there any chance I can harness meditation to alter my invisibility? Before I move into a new experiment, I need to check in on the ones in my lab. My hypothesis predicted that the rice in the "love" jar would decay at a slower rate than the rice in either the "hate" or the control jar. No difference. Perhaps the rotting in Emoto's original experiment had more to do with improper sterilization and contamination than human emotions. Next, I check in on my ice crystal experiment. Another dead end; both the love- and hate-infused water formed symmetrical crystals. The closed containers allowed the water vapour to saturate the air evenly. The dry ice kept the temperature inside of each of the coolers identical. Emoto's experiment did not use these measures. He used open containers and an open freezer. Any number of factors could've influenced the formation of different crystals. I wasn't able to replicate Sean's telekinetic demonstration, and neither of the Emoto experiments show that the mind can affect the material world, but I have found clues that our minds can transform our inner world. How far does this power go? I need to do one last experiment to find out. I'm trying to determine whether the human mind can influence matter. In order to gather evidence, I'm conducting a series of experiments. So far, I've tested whether or not our thoughts have power to move objects, or influence rice in water. My experiments have been interesting, with mixed results. My firsthand observations with mindful meditation have pivoted me in a new direction. I want to test the power of the mind on the actual body of the meditator. I search for the most extreme form of meditation I can find, and come across an ancient Tibetan practice called tummo. Its practitioners are said to be able to summon an inner fire that changes their temperature by as much as 8 degrees. This inner fire is said to heal their heart and burn away internal impurities. To put tummo to the test, I ve picked a cold, wet day for my experiment, and I ll make it even worse when I ask my subjects to sit in a freezer truck for as long as they can. The first has no experience at all with meditation. Initially the volunteer doesn't appear to be suffering from the cold, but after a few more minutes it becomes clear that he's reacting to the freezing temperature. He's obviously shivering, and my sensor readings show a steep drop in his skin temperature, nearing the point where frostbite can set in. After 25 minutes, it's clear that I need to get him out of the truck. To be honest, I was kind of cocky at first. I was just like oh, I got this, you know. Just felt cold, and I was playing with the vapour in my breath. But when they turned that fan on the second time, that's when I felt okay, now it's really setting in. My hands were shaking a lot more, my whole upper body started shaking, and I wasn't really playing anymore. I was really just trying to breathe. What was happening inside your mind? I was just trying to focus on just trying to keep as warm as I could by deep breathing. The control's vitals changed dramatically. His skin temperature dropped from 29 to just 3 degrees; dangerously close to the point where skin freezes. I definitely knew I was in a little bit more of a crisis mode at that point. So the cold defeated you? Uh, yeah. My next test subject is Brad, who claims he can control his body temperature with tummo. Incredibly, Brad says he learned to do this all online, without the years in a Tibetan monastery that tummo usually requires. If his claim is true, it would give me solid evidence that we are capable of unlocking hidden powers in our minds. You walk in the freezer, you sit down. What is going through your mind? At first, I felt that I wasn't as cold as I thought I would be. But as I sat down on the chair, I realized that I was going into this deep tummo technique. It felt like just the walls of the trailer were just very, very tight, so it was keeping a lot of the cold energy. So it wasn't until I actually started getting into it a lot more that I noticed the cold was intensifying a lot more. But I was just in a state where I felt that I was completely in peace, completely in harmony. I'm basically just starting to centre myself firstly, just clearing my mind, then I just start doing... breathing in, so I just start... And just really starting to intensify that breath as I do it more and more. Types of meditations that I go through, a lot of it is guided visual meditations, a lot of it is censoring meditations, but tummo is something that just really helps me. It also represents a bliss state as well too. When you start practicing tummo a lot more, you just feel very much at peace. You feel very centred, you feel very aligned, you feel like you're connecting to your body on a very deeper cellular level. You lasted an incredible 35 minutes. When you're trying to overcome extreme cold, what do you focus on? So basically feeling like you have flames around you, feeling like your skin is made out of a red hot element, just feeling like you have steam rising out of your body. It's also important to try and get a really good grasp of breath so you can hold it in for about a good 20, 30, 45 seconds. And again, that's the catalyst. As long as you can hold your breath in for that amount of time, then you'll feel the heat really just flow throughout your entire body. This small experiment is a good starting point. My tests with meditation have shown that the mind can affect the body itself. My efforts to determine if thoughts can affect the material world have created more questions than answers. While I was able to collect solid results from Emoto's rice and water experiments, I still don't have a scientific explanation for Sean's ability to move the tin foil inside a glass jar. I need to do more experiments.
