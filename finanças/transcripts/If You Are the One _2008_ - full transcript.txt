EVERYTHING CAN BE SOLVED Yes, Mr. Fan? This inventor... What's his name again? Qin Fen. Qin as in Qin Dynasty. Fen as in "to fight". He's waiting in the living room. Show him to the dining room. Yes, Mr. Fan. This is Mr. Fan, the angel investor. This is Mr. Qin, the inventor of the Dispute Correction Tube. Shall we speak English or Chinese? It's your decision. I'm fine with whichever is more natural to you. Then let's use our mother tongue. Our mother tongue? Oh, dear. Look at me. I'm not used to speaking my mother tongue because I don't speak it much anymore. It's so nice to meet you. It's my pleasure. Sir, please. Give me the specifics. This... What inspired this invention of yours? The root of the world's endless wars and escalating conflicts is our inability to judge disputes impartially. Continue. As children, we all played a game called Rock-paper-scissors. - You know how to play it, right? - Yes. It's actually our most primal and effective conflict resolution method. So, why, as adults, did we discard this method? Why? Because it has two critical flaws. Hand velocity differential and last-minute sleight of hand. Last-minute sleight of hand. Rock-paper-scissors. You can suddenly change your hand. And cheat. The Dispute Correction Tube wipes out both flaws. Hold it here. Stick your hand in. Not your head, your hand. Let's try one round. Rock-paper-scissors. - Ready? - Yes. Let's pull it open together at the count of three. One, two, three. That's fascinating. It's cheat-proof. Did you invent this? I did. Just imagine. For instance, this beautiful girl here. If we both wanted her... Don't even think about it. It's just hypothetical. If we all had Dispute Correction Tubes, the war in Kosovo, the problem in Palestine, whether to elect a white or black President in the American elections... That's super good. The Dispute Correction Tube is useful in all aspects of life. It's a revolutionary product. Say no more. This will be a massive high-tech IPO. I'll buy the patent. Name a price. - Two million. - One million. - Two million. - One million. This is what we'll do. Let it decide. Rock-paper-scissors! - Ready? - Yes. One, two, three! All right. I admit defeat. You got yourself a deal. I'm talking about US dollars. Cut the crap. I'm talking about Sterling. PERSONAL AD If you're looking for hot guys, don't bother. If you're looking for rich men, don't come to me. Educational attainment of PhD and above need not reply. Women entrepreneurs need not reply. Parentheses: except for small business owners. Let's avoid mutual disappointment. Perfect men like Andy Lau and Tom Cruise won't be seeking you here. I don't expect to live the Notting Hill dream either. If you're really a goddess, I won't be able to handle you. I'm not expecting a cover-girl to blow me away with her beauty. I just want a physically and emotionally healthy woman who's modern on the outside and traditional on the inside. Slightly demure would be ideal. Don't be too complicated. Don't be too young. She should know how to fold laundry and press clothes, like they just came off the store shelf. That's specific enough, right? Let me introduce myself. I'm no longer young. I'm middle-classed. I smoke, but I don't drink. I went abroad to study and lived overseas for over a decade. I never really studied hard. I slacked off and learned a few survival skills. Now, I've returned unaccomplished. Truthfully, I'm what they call, a "Three Strikes" returnee. No company. No stocks. No degree. Morally, I'm about 50-50. I'm no angel, but I was born a coward. Even if it's not illegal to commit murder, I wouldn't be able to do it. All in all, I'd classify myself as a constructive member of society. If you're interested, please call me. I hope you're the one. Shanshan. May I join you? I'm expecting someone. You haven't changed much. You're still as handsome as ever. I think you got the wrong guy. I'm Jianguo, from the construction company. Have I changed that much? Don't you recognize me? You're from administration. You transferred from the army arts troupe. Administration? I was in logistics. Whatever, you're in charge of entertainment anyway. Back then, you were a cute little boy. I remember you had single eyelids. How'd they become double? I had them done in Korea. What a coincidence, running into each other here over ten years later. What coincidence? I made a date with you. You did? Yes. Ai Moli. Molly. Just like the name of this restaurant. I changed my name. I wanted to surprise you. Aren't you trying to get in my way then? My ad was for a marriage partner. I wanted to see you. Besides, you didn't state, "No men wanted". That's nonsense. Why would I seek a man? I'm not gay. You're... Yes. What? I'm not though. How do you know? I used to think I'm not too. Later on, I realized that I just lacked the courage to face it. Do you remember the labor union field trip to Shidu Nature Park? My leg cramped when I was swimming. You rescued me. - That's right. - I held onto you tightly then. You kept comforting me. Since then, I felt so safe with you. When I don't see you, I think of... Hey! You... are way ahead of me. I... haven't reached that level of enlightenment yet. Then why haven't you gotten married after all these years? I haven't found the right one. Give me a break. Perhaps, subconsciously, you dislike women. Yes. No, I don't. Are you looking down on me? No, absolutely not. I constantly reflect on myself as to why I am so narrow-minded. With such a big heart, why can't I make room for a man? Each time I clear a woman out, guess what happens next? Another woman fills in the space. Hey, let me ask you something. Suppose I were like you... I said, "Suppose". Don't be mad if I get this wrong. You're so annoying. Forget it, I should shut up. I know what you want to say. Deep down, you're like my big brother. It's probably better that way. - Brother. - Yes? You have great skin. You're so fair. What's your first impression of me? You're not far from what I expected. Frankly, looks aren't important to me. It's what's inside that counts. Someone kind and filial to his parents. Even if I didn't like you, I'm sure you'll find a good wife. You really are a modern on the outside and traditional on the inside. That's quite rare. Are your parents still living? My father passed away last year. My mother is still alive. I came back as I was afraid she'd be alone if something happens to her. How old is she? She's in her 70s. Where is your father buried? His urn is in the Eight Treasure Mountain ossuary. Your mother is getting old. A filial son should give his parents a good resting place. Old people are fussy about final resting places. Don't you worry. I would never treat them badly. I think that a man should be responsible and filial. Even if he doesn't make much money, he should provide for his parents' needs. That's a reliable man. Be honest with me. Do you think you fit that description? - I think I do. - I don't think you are! You keep your father's ashes in a tiny box. What if your mother dies? Are you going to squeeze them both into a little box? During Tomb-Sweeping Day, there won't be enough room for incense and joss paper. You call that filial? I'll buy them a cemetery plot then. It's not that I can't afford it. When I left China, only national heroes are buried in graves. The ashes of ordinary folks were kept on shelves. Don't worry. Just pick a spot for me if you know any. As long as it has a nice view, I'll take care of it immediately. If you and I get along, I'll have your tombstone carved, in advance. I promise you won't be kept on a shelf. It really is a great investment. With just 30,000 yuan, you get a grave plot with imperial feng shui. Thirty thousand is just the price of a return trip to America. In just a few years, the same plot will be worth 300,000 yuan. If you sell it at that time, you'll make four times the profit. Hold on. If I sell it, where will my parents be buried? You can buy two. If you buy two plots, my company will give you a five percent discount. Are you Ms. Liang? Yes. I am Qin Fen. I'm sorry, I'm late. Have a seat. I never expected... What? Nothing. What's your line of work? I'm a flight attendant. Which airline? Hainan Airline. How would you rate yourself? Six. Only six? I'd give you a nine. Have you already met a lot of people? You mean from the personal ads? Yes. - You're the first one. - I see. I've met a few of them. It's a first to meet someone as beautiful as you though. There was one girl who was decent, but she met me to sell grave plots. I had to count her out. The rest were a wrong fit. Did you buy one? - What? - The grave plot. I did. She sweet-talked me. She called me a filial son, so I couldn't back off. If I didn't buy it, that would be morally outrageous. I don't have a wife, but I got myself a grave. I've seen your personal ad. I thought you were quite funny. Unlike the others who are so full of themselves. Or those who wrote a load of sentimental crap. It's disgusting. I'll be totally honest with you. I'm not trying to flatter you. Judging by your looks, you're considered as the "goddess". You must have high standards. You're not selling airplanes, are you? I can afford graves, but not airplanes. Why did you say "Women entrepreneurs need not reply"? They're too practical. I prefer the sentimental types. Isn't it good to be practical? These days, most people are practical. My mother and friends all advised me to be more practical. I came here to meet you because I want to be more practical. Then you've got the wrong guy. I'm definitely not the one you're seeking. How do you know what kind of person I'm looking for? I don't even know what I'm seeking. It feels so surreal to be here, but I did ring you up. I'm the one who asked you out. You mean, you're not that serious. You asked me out because you were confused. Do you regret it? A little. Don't be mad. It's not you. I just feel ridiculous. Then we should stop here. It's good to be direct. It's simpler that way. We won't waste each other's time. Do you have other plans? I don't, but there's no point in talking since there isn't any hope for us. You can go ahead then. I'll stay here for a while. Sure. See you then. - See you. - Wait, that's not right. We won't see each other again. In that case... It seems "farewell" isn't right either. You're quite troublesome. Honestly, I am. Bye then. Hey. Do you want to have a drink? We can go somewhere nearby and talk a little more. What for? What are we going to talk about? Are you a shill for a restaurant who's using dates as an excuse to get customers? That's enough. I don't think that you're a bad person, so don't be suspicious of me as well. I'm really a bad person. I was worried you weren't. You drink like a wimp. It won't kill you, you know? Drink up, no one's stopping you. Keep talking. Ever heard of "love at first sight"? I loved you at first sight. We won't be in love even at third sight. Love at first sight doesn't mean that you'll fall for me when you first see me or vice versa. It's not about the sight, but the smell. The other person's scent attracts you, enchants you. You're drawn to each other, you know? So two strangers meet by chance and get close to sniff each other all over. How is that even possible? It's not like that. If you're drawn to each other, you'd sense each other from very far away. Have you ever watched Animal Planet? Yes. Even from dozens of miles away, the animals can sense each other. People are just like animals. Are you only attracted to one type of smell? Animals don't fixate on just one. It only happens to one particular type. It's a mutual attraction. It's not just an attraction, but a kind of infatuation. Everything else just falls flat. So why come all this way to bother me? I'm infatuated, but we can't be together. I struggle to break free from it. I'm constantly being torn apart by the heartache. I can't sleep if I don't get drunk. The man has a family. He loves you, but he can't marry you. Your parents don't know. It hurts, but you can't talk about it. I can't tell anyone. Why tell me then? I couldn't take it anymore. I'm so aggrieved. I won't see you again anyway. It doesn't matter what you think of me. Then I should charge a fee. He has all the fun, but I have to drink with a miserable woman. Since when were we best buddies? Take as much as you want, but be prepared to drink if you take my money. You can't just sip. I really can't drink. I'll accompany you for free. That's fine. I told you one of my secrets. In return, you should tell me something that you won't tell anyone else. Then we'll be even. Why are you so difficult to deal with? Fine, don't tell me. It doesn't interest me anyway. Let it rot in your stomach instead. I originally thought you were quite a mature man. Look at yourself. How can you deal with a sentimental woman? Are we really not going to see each other again? No. Do you know why I don't drink? Aren't you drinking now? A friend and I ran a travel agency in America. We specialized in Chinese groups. Once, we had a government tour group, led by a bureau director. It was a very profitable gig. There was a woman named Xiaobai. She was the translator. She was the quiet type and pretty. I had my sights on her the moment they landed. After spending over ten days with her on the trip, I fell for her. Afterwards, we, you know... What? You know. We got intimate. Afterwards, she cried. She wanted me to help her stay in America. I agreed without a second thought. I really liked her. Besides, it wasn't that hard to do. The next day, I told my friend that I was with Xiaobai. I asked him to work with me to keep Xiaobai in America. He freaked out. He said, "Absolutely not." We got the job because of his connection with the bureau director. If they left someone behind, the bureau director would be in trouble. Aside from causing the director trouble, we wouldn't be able to do business with them again. If I insisted on her staying, my friend wouldn't only end our friendship but he might even kill me. So you two sold her out. Let me finish my story. I begged my friend to promise not to report her. I'd make sure she didn't run for it. When we saw them off at the airport, Xiaobai just stared at me the whole time. Her eyes were like daggers. I didn't dare to look at her. I was so ashamed. That's your secret? The bureau director heard that I came back this year. So he invited us to dinner. The people from the tour group came too. The only person absent was Xiaobai. I made a lot of small talks, then casually asked about Xiaobai. They said, "Don't you know?" She committed suicide after she returned. I couldn't believe it. I asked, "What happened?" He said... Her husband was abusive and he beats her all the time. She kept trying to divorce him, but she failed. She planned to use the opportunity, then stay in America. However, she failed and she even got reported. So she committed suicide when she returned. So, I asked my friend, "Were you the one who reported her?" He said, "Yes." He said he couldn't trust me. So he informed the bureau director about it. That day, I beat up my friend. And drank a lot of alcohol. In the end, I was crawling on the floor like a dog, grabbing people's legs and crying. You even beat him up? You're the one who killed Xiaobai. You're despicable. Since then, I think about her every time I drink. Afterwards, I stopped drinking. You had to make me drink and spill my rotten guts. Are we even now? Now, you know what kind of person I am. Just leave. Leave. So, if we get married, do I have to go and live with your family? Can I refuse? There's something you need to know beforehand. What is it? My aunt has a bad memory. How bad? She can remember today's events. By tomorrow, it's all gone. Cheche. Is your home far away? How do I get there? First, you fly to Kunming and take a day's bus ride to Mengzi. Then take another bus to Pingbian, a day's ride on a tractor, another day's ride on an ox cart, and you're there. She can't remember things, but what about people? No. She also can't remember people? Don't worry, she writes all the important events and people in her notebook. If you two get married, she'll read it when she wakes up every morning and she'll be able to recall who you are. Qin Fen. Are you tired already? Keep playing. If it doesn't work out, can we get a divorce? My brother will cripple you. Miss. Stop writing it down. Just forget about what happened today. What were we talking about earlier? How do you like it here in Haikou? It's great. It has a sunny, tropical climate and there's no pollution. I've been here two years now. I play basketball, I swim and I dive. I've never felt healthier. - You have to take good care of yourself. - Yes. How are the blind dates going? It's going. Let me fix you up. - Sure. - Really? She's a really good person. If I weren't married, I'd marry her myself. I used to be married, but my husband passed away. How long has it been? He just died recently. How long were you together? Does that... Does that matter? Of course. Especially if you were deeply in love. After all, his remains are barely cold yet. Around seven or eight years. You must be hurting. Compared to before, I feel much better now. For the past five years, I didn't even know where he slept at night. At least I know where he is now. You must have gotten him a grave plot. Yanchun Ridge Cemetery. Whenever I need him, he's there. Of course. If he went missing, you should get your money back. How old are you? Fifty? No. I'm in my 40s. I look pretty old, don't I? It's fine, I like older men. How's your health? I'm on the weak side. That's great. Don't bother exercising. If you get sick, I'll take care of you. Don't you want a guy with a strong and healthy body? Do you prefer a soft marshmallow? Soft marshmallows taste better. With an old, sickly guy, aren't you worried about the quality of your marriage? At your age... Let me be frank. You're at your sexual peak. Do you believe that the foundation for love is sex? Not entirely. Without sex though, that's not love. That would be friendship. I don't agree. So what if there's no sex? Many people grow old together without it. I don't mean to imply that there'd be no sex at all. Just... not too frequently. What's your idea of sex... that's "not too frequently"? Ideally speaking... Okay, go ahead. Once a month? Once a year. If you agree, we can meet again. I don't agree. I know why your husband didn't come home before. If we got married, I'd be hard to find too. What a shame. Is sex really that interesting? Yes. I'm sorry, I couldn't take the call earlier. Xiaoxiao. Let me tell you something. Please don't get mad. My wife and I will be on the same flight as you. Can't you change your ticket? I just found out. She booked the tickets ages ago. I never expected that you'd be on the same flight. You know I care about you, but I have to attend my brother's wedding. I just hope you can avoid her as much as you can. Out of sight, out of mind. How can I avoid her? The airplane cabin is so small and you're seated in first class. Where... Where should I hide? You can't treat me this way. Welcome to Grand China Air. - Hello. - Welcome to Grand China Air. Boarding pass, please. Liang Xiaoxiao. It really is you. We meet again. Please proceed to your seat. Don't block the way for the passengers behind you. - Welcome to Grand China Air. - Hello, this way, please. - Welcome to Grand China Air. - Welcome to Grand China Air. Boarding pass, please. - This way to the left. - Thank you. - Welcome to Grand China Air. - Boarding pass, please. This way, please, sir. Please hurry and take your seat. Sir, please hurry. We're about to close the door. - Please sign this. - Okay. come in. I'll sign it. Thank you. Hello, let me do it. Please take your seat. Here's a hot towel for you. Would you like some drinks? Miss. If there is an empty seat, I'd like to sit with my husband. I'm sorry, the first class is full today. I'd be happy to check the economy class, if you don't mind. My husband and I booked this flight together. It doesn't make sense not to be seated together. Next time, you can arrive earlier to have your boarding passes changed. The system wouldn't know that you're husband and wife. I'll switch with you. No one should split up a married couple. Miss. I know the ground crew's the one responsible for this, but you should listen to the passengers' feedback and inform your superiors. You always say you want to improve customer service. How? You have to pay attention to details. Come over here, sir. There's no need for the hassle. It's a short flight after all. We're about to take off. If you're going to switch your seats, please do it soon. It's no hassle. I already stood up. Go ahead. - Please. - Thank you. - Please fasten your seat belts. - Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will take off shortly. To ensure your safety, please make sure that your seat belts are securely fastened. And keep your mobile phones powered off. Thank you. Don't you know that we're about to take off? Whatever it is can wait. I just wanted to remind you. For your own safety, please also fasten your seat belt. So, that guy is the one you can't live without? Please don't bother me while I'm working. Some things just aren't meant to be. I'll be in Hangzhou for a few days. If you're flying to Beijing, call me if you feel like going for drinks. You can treat me as your drinking buddy. HANGZHOU PORT When outsiders imagine Hangzhou, the first thing that they think of is the West Lake. They don't know that just 5km away from the city lies a rare environmental treasure. It's China's first wetlands national park called the West Brook Wetlands. A Song Dynasty emperor passed by this area when he was running for his life. Like me, he was enchanted. He wanted to build a palace here, but the project was abandoned due to lack of funds. He was reluctant to leave the place. And said, "West Brook, may you remain here." That's how it earned its beautiful name. The home we're seeing today is in Liuxia Town. I believe you'll want to remain here too after seeing this place. Emperor Gaozong of Song would have stayed, but he was broke. All that remained were his words. I've brought cash though. If I like the place, I'll remain here my whole life. This is your foyer. This is your living room. This is your master bedroom. And this is your private pond. All right. Stop saying "your" living room, "your" bedroom and "your" private pond. I don't know if I'm buying it yet. I'm sure you've seen better homes, but no amount of money can buy an environment like this. Hello? I was in a lousy mood yesterday. So I took a day off and stayed in Hangzhou. I had to drink more than half a bottle of wine to force myself to sleep. I slept through the whole morning and woke up not knowing what to do. If you're not busy, care to join me for a chat? That's fine, but I've got another blind date this afternoon. You came all the way to Hangzhou for a blind date? You're really casting a wide net. I can't leave any stones unturned. I'd rather meet thousands of ladies than miss my chance with the right one. I don't have plans today anyway. Take me along, I'll check her out for you. How should I introduce you? Should I say we dated each other, but you rejected me? Just tell her we're drinking buddies. Actually, you don't need to introduce me at all. I'll just sit and drink tea nearby, then advise you afterwards. I won't get in your way. That sounds good. But I'm warning you. If I find a suitable match, if we dig each other's smell, like you said, I won't have time for you then. Don't tell me I put hoes before bros. Relax. If that happens, I'll be overjoyed for you. All right then. Hey, miss. How much does this place cost? Don't mind me. You don't seem like you're from around here. I'm Taiwanese. My father owns a factory in Hangzhou, so we're here for the time being. - Have you ever been to Beijing? - Of course. Between Beijing or Hangzhou, which one do you prefer? That's a difficult question. - Thank you. - Based on weather and living environment, it'd be Hangzhou, of course. I quite like the people in Beijing though. My grandfather is from Beijing. I love hearing his accent. "What's going on?" The accent is on the last word, not the second to the last word. What's going on? "What's going on?" Later on, my grandfather went to Taiwan with the Nationalists after Mainland had fallen. Hold on there. We call it "liberated". You call it "fallen". We call it "liberated". "Liberated"? What does "liberated" mean? Liberated? I understand. Liberated and fallen are just different ways of expressing it based on your point of view. That's right. We can agree to disagree. Exactly. There are some universal values that everyone acknowledges. For instance, compassion is to love all beings. After the recent earthquake, the Taiwanese all rushed to provide relief. The Mainland Chinese were very moved. My father's company donated too. It pained us to see our fellow Chinese suffering. Especially the children who lost their parents. Poor things. There was a dying mother on the news. To her last breath, she breastfed her child. Even after she took her last breath, she was still nursing. Maternal love knows no bounds. Mothers can sacrifice anything for her child. Fathers can do that too. Even if they weren't my own child, I would have adopted one of those orphans. Do you really have such concern for children? Yes. If you were an orphan, I'd adopt you too. You sure are forgetful. Didn't I just tell you that my father has a factory here? Don't be disappointed though. I have one in my belly. You can be his father. I thought you weren't married. I'm not. However, I'm pregnant. Whose is it? I don't want to talk about that guy. He doesn't want the baby. I don't want the child to be without a father. That's why I'm seeking a loving father for him. I think you'll be a good fit. Well... What do you think about me? I like you a lot. But... Didn't you say you don't care if he was your own? If we don't tell him and the child only sees you after he's born, he'd be just like your own, right? I can accept an orphan. A child with a full set of parents is a different thing. You can't put a Mercedes logo on a BMW. That won't work, right? Why does it matter if you can still drive it? If it breaks down though, the Mercedes parts won't fit and the BMW mechanics won't repair it. Let's just forget about it. I'm flattered that you like me. I think you should find another man. I'll just have to bite the bullet. What a good opportunity! How could you be so heartless? I thought you two seemed like a great fit. Look. She's beautiful, wealthy, and you get a son for free. Honestly, for a guy like you, it's like winning the lottery. Normally, I don't mind getting things for free, but I still want to rely on myself when it comes to starting a family. I won't accept help from anyone. I think the personal ad isn't going too well for me. I have no interest in ugly ducklings, but the good-looking ones are either hiding something or frigid. Where'd all the simple physically and emotionally women go? Why can't I meet even one? Don't try to imply anything. Who's not emotionally healthy? I'm not referring to you, you're not good-looking. Calling you "good-looking" would be an insult. You're ravishingly beautiful. A rare, precious beauty. If you married into the royal family, you'd be up there with Diana. For some, beauty is in the eyes of the beholder. I'm not exaggerating, but you'd still be beautiful in your enemy's eyes. Don't hold it in, just laugh it out. Hey. I have something to tell you. I came with you on your date. Would you accompany me to meet someone too? I didn't ask you to come. You invited yourself. Are you coming or not? No. I'm asking you one more time. Are you coming or not? No. Fine. Bye. This is Mr. Qin. You met on the flight. Nice to meet you. Have a seat. Sit here. Excuse us. We'll need some privacy. Okay. Thanks. Mr. Qin and I knew each other. We were just acquaintances. After meeting each other on the flight though, I'm not sure why our feelings changed. Perhaps it was love at second sight. After we landed, Mr. Qin called me. He asked me to stay in Hangzhou a few more days so we could get to know each other better. We've spent the past two days together. We feel fortunate to have met again. You're the person closest to me. So I brought him here to introduce you two formally. It's only fair that you should know. Aren't you going to wish us well? Didn't you always want me to find someone good for me? Xiaoxiao told me a lot about you the past few days. She said you treated her very well. Meeting you on the airplane seemed like fate. Have you made your decision? Yes. Mr. Qin. Perhaps you know about my relationship with Xiaoxiao. I'm not as lucky as you. I'll entrust Xiaoxiao to you. Be good to her. She's too willful because I spoiled her. I hope you can be patient with her. If she's unhappy, I'll be unhappy too. All right, this show is over. I can't take it anymore. I'll go ahead. I know it's difficult for you to meet. Xiaoxiao and I are just ordinary friends. You're the only one she cares about. You're the lucky one. She drinks every day because of you. It will kill her if she keeps this up. I can't go on like this. I'm weak and I feel inferior. I will use my mind and body, all of me, to do something that will make you regret. Stop drinking. Xiaoxiao. I didn't betray you. How could I ever punish you? You asked me to wait for three years. I'm waiting. You wouldn't want me, but I'll still wait for you. Until the day that we've agreed on. I thought I could love you my whole life. I never thought our time together would be numbered. One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. ONE UNREAD MESSAGE I'VE STOPPED DRINKING. DON'T WORRY. XIAOXIAO. "I've stopped drinking. Don't worry." My surname is Qin. Qin as in Emperor Qin. Fen as in "to fight". Xiaoxiao. I got your text message. Xiao as in "smiling tiger". That's correct. I called twice, but you didn't answer. Call me if you have time. Yes. At the place where we first met. It's 5:00 pm. I've said it eight times already. Yes, that's right. See you. I'm sorry about that. I've made arrangements for two dates. It's more efficient that way. Please don't mind. That's fine. I'm a stock trader. The market has been quiet lately. So I'm using my spare time to find a husband. Once the market turns around, I won't have the time. Do you invest in the stock market? No. I don't get it. Actually, I think seeking a partner is like trading stocks. You can consider different stocks then make your decision based on a rational analysis of its performance. For instance, the person's looks or body figure. Or personality and education. Or financial stability and family background. - Or... - So... How am I performing as a stock? Judging from your age and looks, you've sunk below your offer price. Am I in danger of getting delisted then? Not necessarily. Inexperienced traders often buy high, but that's very risky. It's very easy to get trapped. More experienced traders buy low. For a stock like you with bad performance, most traders wouldn't touch you. Very few would show interest. Thus, you're a low risk. You're already at the bottom. How can you go any lower? So when you buy a low-priced stock like me, would you invest long-term or would you just play with me short-term? Play with you short-term? Do you have any explosive potential? I can only invest long-term and treat it as non-existent. What if you've held it for a while, but it never had a strong performance? Don't worry. I'm not stupid enough to invest in just one. They can't all underperform, right? No one's that unlucky. Hello? You're here? I'm right here. I see you. Please wait a bit. Order whatever you like, it's on me. I feel obligated to warn you. I'm very risky. It's best to keep your distance. I'm useless and unattractive. If you get stuck with me, you might never be able to get rid of me. From an investment perspective, I'm considered as subprime. I'm also reluctant to pass this burden to you. Let's stop trading for today. I also have another stock to see at six o'clock. Why don't you go ahead and chat with her? The market isn't doing well right now. Don't jump in blindly. Don't rush it. Just wait and see. I hope I didn't interrupt your date. She wasn't interested. She said I dropped below my offer price. Poor thing. Old guy like you on the dating scene just keeps getting your pride injured. Spare me the crocodile tears. Tell me. What is it this time? I'd like to officially become your girlfriend. Which type of girlfriend are you referring to? The type that you marry. Why? Have you gotten pregnant too? I'm not in the mood for jokes. I just have one condition. What is it? While we're dating or even married, I'll fulfill all the duties of a wife, but allow me to have someone else in my heart. I won't do anything. I just want to keep a space for him in my heart. I might stare blankly into space and miss him from time to time, but it won't be anything more than that. I'll never contact him. Can you accept that? You're physically present with me, but emotionally, you're elsewhere. You can refuse the terms. I know it's unfair. Then, is it okay that I'm emotionally with you, but occasionally have flings? No. What if I'm also emotionally away when you're emotionally not with me? That's fine, but we have to physically faithful to one another. Come closer. Then I'll need to find someone else to think about too. Otherwise, you'll have someone in your heart and I won't. I'll be at a huge disadvantage then. So you agree then? Yes. Will you go with me to Hokkaido? He and I started there. I'd like to end it there too. I bet you're bursting with joy inside now. - Mr. Wu. - Hey. You haven't changed in ten years. You look like a Hokkaido farmer at first glance. You just have a more devious look in your eyes. This is Xiaoxiao. This is the Mr. Wu I told you about. He married his wife from Hokkaido and never looked back. Ms. Liang, I'm honored to be of service to you. Thank you. Let me get that. Mr. Wu, what are those arrows for? Hey, Ms. Liang. You've been here before. You must know the reason. Tell him. Hey. Hey. He asked you a question. What? Do you know what are those arrows used for? In Hokkaido, it snows heavily during winter. The arrows serve as an indication of how wide the road is, as a way of reminding the drivers not to drive past the curb. I see. I see. - Did I get that right, Mr. Wu? - Yes. He told you about that when you were here together, right? Let's just enjoy our time together. You're my boyfriend now. Let's not mention him, okay? I'm not used to it yet. It feels like my wallet is full of borrowed money. After I spend it, I'll be in debt. Hey, Mr. Wu. Stop the car. TEMPLE I'd like to go and worship inside. I'm terribly sorry, - but there's a funeral today. - I wonder what's he saying. It's closed to the public today. I see. I got it. That's too bad. Thank you. There's no chance today. Why not? The temple's closed to the public today. You can't go in for worship. Well, talk to him then. Tell him we came from China just to offer our prayers today. Have you committed a sin? I thought you were an atheist. Why the sudden piousness? I have a religion now. God gave me such a beautiful wife. I'd be rude not to burn some incense. Hey. I haven't decided to marry you yet. Besides, a Japanese Buddha can't help you. Don't speak of such blasphemy. Buddhas have no nationality. Hokkaido is my land of fortune. There's nothing wrong with praying to every Buddha I see here. Try to convince him again. Fine. Considering your incredible luck with Ms. Liang, I'll speak to him again on your behalf. Why are we being frisked? It's the funeral of an influential family. Let's get out of here then. Are you kidding me? We're already here. We can't go now. KOKUTAI-JI Stop peeking. Act mournful. Did you really cry? Stop laughing. Didn't you cry? I saw you crying too. I tried so hard to squeeze those tears out. Those Japanese must think us Chinese are really loyal friends. We're not even family, but we came all this way to bawl our eyes out. We practically forced our way in. Both of you better not piss me off. I'm considered a mafia guy now. You probably knew it was a funeral from the start. What are you complaining about? You're the one who insisted on going in. You're truly adorable. Excuse me. - Yes? - How do we get to Hinanoza Hotel? It's straight ahead. Turn right and you'll see it. - I see. All right. Thank you. - It's very easy to find. Okay. Just turn right up ahead. What does that say? Four Sisters what? Four Sisters Pub. FOUR SISTERS What's our sleeping arrangements? - You two in one room. - You and I can share a room. Let's catch up on old times. Cut the pretense. You have a beauty like her and you want to be in my room? It's not a pretense. We haven't reached that point yet. I'm not the one she loves. Please have a good rest. Thank you. Here, try this. It's fishy. It's pungent. And has a kick to it. Try it. Do you think I need more stimulation? What I need now isn't stimulation, but numbness. The best part about drinking is that it can make you numb. Don't just drink. Try these clams. I need to get numb too. If you weren't in utter despair, I'd never be here discussing marriage with you. My share of stimulation can't be less than yours. Tell me. How can you allow your girlfriend to have someone else in her heart? What do you like about me? Have I ever said I liked you? You have to be honest. That will be the premise of our relationship going forward. My premise for marrying you is because I can't find anyone more foolish than you. I'll never be so foolish again. You... are incapable of splitting your heart in half. Your feelings are written all over your face. Let me say this. You haven't turned the page in your story with him. Once you turn the page to a new story, you'll still devote yourself wholly. That's why I put up with you right now. You're a fool, but I'm not. If I learned my lesson and got smarter, wouldn't it ruin your beautiful plan? In that case, I'll sell you to the local tribesmen tomorrow. You'll hunt and fish for them for the rest of your life. And have a slew of babies. You'll be scorched by the sun, drenched in rain, never full, and in tattered clothes. If you try to escape, they'll catch you and beat you. Three torturous years from now, you'll be a dark, thin, ugly, repulsive, and wizened old hag. I'm just getting started. Want to hear more? I'm only fooling around with you because you're pretty. Can you accept that? Are you up to the game? Do you think you're a match for me in the game of emotional counterfeit? I bet you can't even tell if I had eight other women in my heart. I've got nothing to lose. Since you don't care about me, I'll just take advantage of you. Why would you say that? She was getting on my case. If I didn't say something nasty, she'd never stop. You're too serious. Look at her. Sit down. Let her go. What a perfect opportunity. After this drink, you should invite Xiaoxiao to the hot spring with you. What kind of friend would do that and abandon you here? Cut the crap. This time, I'm serious about marrying her. I can't be reckless about it. She'd never give me her body before she gave me her heart. Then again, once she gives you her heart, your body is sentenced for life. I should enjoy the freedom while I still can. What do you like about her? She's a kind soul. Oh, please. You like her because she's pretty. What's wrong with that? Should I deprive my children of good genes? Must I marry someone ugly? And spend my life trying to escape her? Which of these four do you think is the prettiest? They're all quite charming. Natsuyo. She's pretty. I say it's Haruko. Excuse me. May we come in? - Welcome. - Welcome. - Please, come in. - Come in. - There are so few customers. - It's still early. Please, sit down. Ask Natsuyo and Haruko to drink with us. I am Natsuyo. And that's Haruko. She's Akimi. I'm Akimi. And Yukie. - What? - What about the photo outside? That photo was taken 40 years ago. Really? We were famous in Tokyo. We were "The Four Seasons". You suckers fell for it. We stayed together all these years. Aren't we beautiful? Very beautiful indeed. I see. Hey. Where are the Four Sisters? They're here. She's Natsuyo. The one singing is the one you like, Haruko. Why are they all so old? They took that photo 40 years ago. Back then, they used to be famous. They retired here in Hokkaido and opened this bar. - Let's just leave then. - No. - We can't leave now. - Here. - It wouldn't be polite. - Thank you for waiting. - Here you go. - Just look at how friendly they are. - Excuse me. Here are your chopsticks. - Have a drink. - Enjoy. - What would you like? No more sake for me. I'll have some whiskey. - How about Windsor whiskey? - Sure. - A bottle of Windsor whiskey, please. - Okay. With ice, but without green tea. Cheers. You fooled us with a 40-year-old photo. That's very funny. Come in. What a beautiful woman. Bottoms up. The fate of the star Broken and scattered over the universe At least they shone Until the very last moment This is an inspirational song. Why are your voices so full of despair? If you added up the Four Sisters' ages together, they'd be more than 300 years old. How could we not despair? Hey. You take your girlfriend on a trip, yet you sneak out to have a drink with girls and don't come home. Is that how you treat your girlfriend? Are you really being sincere? It's called paying back in the same coin. I've allowed you to love another man. Why can't you allow my body to enjoy a little fling? You're shameless. If you let go of the past and be mine, I swear, even if Maggie Cheung, Angelina Jolie, Sophie Marceau, and Lin Chi-ling asked me to have a drink with them, I wouldn't drink a single glass. You'd drink ten glasses instead of one. Hey, check and see if he's having a fever. He's starting to talk nonsense. Gosh. Poor thing. The reality is so far off from your expectations. Should I find you a psychologist? No medicine can heal my wounded heart. You're my best medicine. Aren't you afraid that I'm poisonous? If so, I'll still drink it. Someone tormented you. Now, you're tormenting me. That's the wheel of fate. It's fatal attraction. Hey. We passed this place several times, but I didn't get to ask you. Is this a church? Why is it so small? It's used for confessions. Confessions? A lot of city people feel guilty about all the bad things they've done. So they come to Hokkaido to make confessions. They confess their guilt and hope to receive forgiveness. You must have a lot of sins. You should confess, clear your conscience, and turn over a new leaf. Go. They can't speak Chinese anyway. You can tell them everything you've done. That's better than keeping it bottled up inside. Go ahead. God is more forgiving than the police. We won't eavesdrop. We'll wait for you here. I'll leave him in your hands. Okay. Mr. Wu. Are you sure he can't speak Chinese? Don't worry. Even if he did, he's not going to broadcast what you said. You may begin. I would like to donate ten million to the church, would you accept it? That's ten times a million, it's a lot. You don't want any money? I guess you really can't understand Chinese. Now, I can relax. Let me start from the bad things I did in kindergarten. Qin Fen is really a lot of fun. He hasn't changed all these years. Just the same. Being with him for the past few days brought back many good memories from our youth. He's quite a genuine person. He's romantic too. His mind is full of impractical ideas. Deep down, he's an idealist. That's why he's still a bachelor until now. Marriage is dependent on fate. Sometimes, it's just not meant to be no matter how nice you are. That's fate. He really likes you. Most women don't understand him. I think you do. I hope it works out for you two. Did he tell you about his invention? It's very interesting. He made a chunk of money from it too. I don't know much about him, but he feels like an old friend. My intuition told me that he's a man I can rely on. If I must get married and I can't be with the man I love, I should at least find a good friend. If that's what you're thinking, I advise you to let Qin Fen go. It wouldn't be fair to him. I'm not lying to him. He accepts it. Xiaoxiao. I don't know the kind of man that you're in love with. Is he more worthy than Qin Fen? You're being very selfish. You can't exploit other people's feelings for you. Don't get mad if I'm being too direct. That's okay. I like people who are straightforward. Once, we went to steal peaches. There were people everywhere. So we climbed over the wall. After we got the peaches, we had to run. But we were sure we couldn't go those two paths. Then someone yelled, "Someone's coming!" Then there was this time when we were studying farming and we were in the same dorm. Me. Xiaowen, Zhang Kui, Lu Dewei. And also... Anyhow, there were eight or nine of us in a room. It was night time. I got this idea. I came up with it. We rubbed balm on the soles of his feet. Then waved a fan over them. As soon as we did, Zhang Kui wet his bed. His blanket and sheets were soaked. It really cracked us up. We didn't admit who did it. The next morning, he saw that everything was wet, but he didn't dare hang them outside. He asked, "How did I pee myself?" Nobody said anything, then somebody sold me out. He said I did it. I asked, "Am I that kind of person?" I'm just getting started. After school, I have countryside stories, then my career, and love life. I'm just getting started. Afterwards, I told him I'm not that kind of person. I said Xiaowen did it. Xiaowen said... He said he didn't do it. He said I did it. I said, "No way. I would never do that. It was Lu Dewei and the others who did it." Me? Maybe I... I didn't say it wasn't my idea... What's wrong? What's the matter? Your friend is extremely pious, but he has far too many sins. We're a small church. We don't have enough room. There's a much bigger church nearby. I can't let him stay any longer. I'm so sorry, I'll get him out right away. I'm very sorry. I was young. I didn't know any better, but now that I think about it, - I feel... - Stop it, let's go. ...would even let me bow to her. Hey, Qin Fen. How many bad things did you do? The kind even hell wouldn't let you in for? Water... Give me water. Lord. Please forgive his atrocities. The Lord sent you to me to save my soul and get me out of hell. Don't let Him down. I'm still struggling in a world of suffering. Who will save me then? I will. Hey. - I heard this place has lots of bears. - That's right. - Have they ever hurt anyone before? - Yes. Bears may seem clumsy, but when they attack, they're very swift. They're swifter than a deer. Xiaoxiao. Xiaoxiao, come back! Watch out for bears! You're lucky if you see a bear. Nonsense, the bear is the one who's lucky. Did you see any? Where are they? Come on, let's go. Is there a need to be that worried? How would I explain if you got hurt? Who do you plan to explain to? No one cares about me. I do. Mr. Wu. Ask if they've seen any bears. Excuse me! Yes? Have you seen any bears around here? - Bears? - Yes. There were four of us when we came. Now there's only the two of us. What did they say? They were a party of four before they went up the mountain. Now there's only two of them left. What? - How could there be bears here? - That's impossible. - There are no bears. - We fooled you. You really believed us. Who says the Japanese aren't funny? They're a bunch of real jokers. The bear is coming! Please protect your head and heart. If the bear flips you over, flip back to your original position. You're so pretty. It'd be a shame to eat you. I'd rather keep you alive to be the mother of my cubs. Your eyes don't look like those of a bear. What do they look like then? They look like the eyes of a wolf. Do you regret meeting me? No. In fact, I'm quite happy. If you'll marry me, our days will be as sweet as honey. Are you really willing to marry me? If you say yes, we can tie the knot tonight. You're such a big, bad bear. Don't talk to bears. They'll tear you to pieces. He said, "Don't talk to bears. They'll tear you to pieces." I was already torn apart long ago. Are you cold? Let's go back. I'll light it for you. I want to light it for you. Do you want me? Yes. I'm yours tonight. Just for tonight? Yes. I'd rather not have you if it's just for one night. Why not? Don't you think I'm pretty? I'd like to repay you. I can't take this favor. I won't be able to return it. You don't have to. You deserve it. Let me be a fool just this once. I'm in love with you. Will you marry me? Don't do that. I want you to say yes or no. Yes. When? Give me a little more time. How long? Qin Fen. The last few days, I've watched myself through Mr. Wu's eyes. I'm such a strange woman. I came all this way with you, but I just kept pushing you away. But I bet you understand how I got to this point. I keep struggling to rescue myself from an abyss of despair. I hoped that a kind person like you and the pristine Hokkaido could help me rediscover life's beauty. That was a selfish hope for myself. However, this hateful love has emptied me inside out. The more I struggle, the more the memories pull me down. This evening, in the last sunset of my life, I saw a lovelier side of you. I also saw how pathetic and helpless I was. You're the perfect partner. If I'd only met you years ago... I'm a fool to let you pass me by. Perhaps this is God's punishment towards me. Goodbye, Qin Fen. Don't look for me. However, please forgive me. QIN FEN After Xiaoxiao jumped, a fishing boat who passed by found her. They rescued her. She's in the hospital right now. She's so damn foolish. No matter what happens to her, I'll be with her. You're really naughty. I thought I was troublesome, but you're worse than me. I know you feel wronged. With me by your side, you can overcome anything. SHARICHO NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE HOSPITAL All right. I'll get going. Go ahead. Otherwise, you'll lose your job. Be good to her. She's a good girl with a kind heart. She already died once. Her love for him is dead as well. This is for your wife and kids. It's been more than ten years since we last met. Who knows when we'll meet again. She's going to need the money now more than I do. You can skip the courtesies with me. Money means nothing to me. What I lack are friends. My best friends are scattered all over the world. Sometimes, I really miss you guys. I feel terribly lonely. Take care. In the season of the blooming of roses At Cape of Shiretoko Please do not forget All of our past We drank and sang Up to the hilltop Overlooking from the hilltop Dawn breaks after midnight The day of parting has come At Cape of Shiretoko You leave the small village Going far across the mountain I don't want you to forget Don't be heartless Don't let my... It's almost New Year. You cheated death. Make a wish. Give me your phone. Hello? It's me. It's been a long time. I just want to thank you for loving me once. I'm very happy now. Because I've found someone that I want to share my life with. Be good to your wife. I wish you both the best. Goodbye. That was my phone. Your phone has long been in the sea since you jumped. You don't need to be in touch with other people. Understood. The root of the world's endless wars and escalating conflicts is our inability to judge disputes impartially. The Dispute Correction Tube wipes out both flaws. Please insert your hand. Okay. Now, grab this handle. Rock-paper-scissors. When I count to three, we'll both pull it open. One, two, three! That's interesting. Did you sell that to him? Isn't that your invention? You two are venture capitalists. I have my own humble opinion about the nature of venture capitals. Let's discuss it together. Venture capitals are all about risks. The greater the risk, the more one invests. If there's no risk, there'll be no investments. I'll stake my reputation in saying that investing in this product is way too risky. It's suitable for venture capitalists. This will be a massive high-tech IPO. It's a revolutionary product. I'll play one round with him. If I win, please throw it into the ocean for me. Is that you? Who else could it be? Why is your hair all gray? The worst financial crisis of the century wiped me out. This year's economy is really in the dumps. Three top investment banks went belly-up. Nothing's selling. Don't cry. It's going to be okay. Don't cry. Listen to me. I sold this to you, right? Yes. - Right? - Right. I'll buy it back. Name your price. Two million. You were planning to throw it away. One million. - Two million. - One million. Okay. Let's not argue. - A million it is then. - It's a deal. I meant Sterling. Cut the crap. I meant Japanese Yen. - Japanese Yen? - Yes. Don't worry about your loss. Next year, when the economy rebounds, I'll sell it at a high price. And I'll split the money with you. What are you looking at? Let me see. The future. CSC FINANCIAL FINANCE, TECHNOLOGY, REAL ESTATE, IRON AND STEEL HEALTHCARE, ENTREPRENEURSHIP We drank our wedding toast Such beautiful delusions Like sweet sugar cubes Jumping into bitter coffee Words I thought were true Gave me tears from the pain I have no regrets There's no going back now Just waking up to get drunk again
