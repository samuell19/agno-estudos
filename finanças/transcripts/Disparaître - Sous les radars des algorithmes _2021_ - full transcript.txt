This next song is about all the private pictures you put on the web. Of yourselves, your loved ones, everything you are and want to be. A giant worm gobbles up your data, the storm of metadata is brewing online... Tech firms like social media companies, YouTube, etc. tell us: "Express yourself, be yourself, tell us your story, post your images, give us your words. This is for you." Beware! I think everyone has a feeling that something is going on, but despite that, we close our eyes, we move on. Every day, we leave digital traces when we browse, talk online or travel. Even the most innocuous data exposes us to many risks. Their business model is to collect as much information as possible so that they can then sell that data to who wants to find exactly you. We don't have the same way of protecting ourselves if the threat is because you have a jealous husband or a jealous wife, or if it's your boss at work or if, as it happened to me, you're working with Wikileaks on NSA and CIA documents. This is a great warning to the rest of the world. Our civil liberties are eroding in front of our eyes. Young students, ordinary citizens, journalists, dissidents, we all have specific levels of online threats. But there are solutions, so how can we learn to protect ourselves, each at our own level? When I hear people say "privacy is dead", I think that's nonsense. I don't believe it at all. I think there are many, many ways that you can remain confidential even in this hyperconnected world with a lot of state surveillance. Max Thommes is an actor and musician living in Berlin. He is an avid user of social networks and the services of Big Tech. He has recently become aware of the tracking of his data. In Germany today, he knows that the risks for him are limited, but he is worried about Big Tech's growing threat to our freedoms. CHAOS COMMUNICATION CAMP GERMANY To learn how to protect his privacy, he's going to the Chaos Communication Camp. Every four years, this event brings together a group of hackers and coding enthusiasts from across Europe to share and build a more open internet. Hey! Good to see you! - Yes! - I have some questions. Please. I'm trying to not be too much on Facebook and not to get every link from Facebook, but then you showed me that even when I am logged out, it's still tracking. How could I protect myself from that? Compartmentalisation done well. In my case, I separate Facebook in a specific browser, so that Facebook doesn't communicate or share cookies with the others. This way, if a website has trackers, it will not link your activity on this website with Facebook. We had this talk in the afternoon about Facebook because we try to get away from it, but still no one does. On the one side, we don't know what is a better Facebook, so we, as a society, have a hard time figuring out which kinds of rights and empowerment we are losing because of the Facebook imprint. My theory is that we should be in control of our algorithm, our data, and know exactly where we're sharing it and how it is treated. That cannot be sustainable by the current Facebook business model. Another question: one big thing that I am really trying to conquer, is how could I get rid of Google? The way we try to approach Google is also to compartmentalise. Accept that if you have to use one of these tools, because you can't avoid it, at least you can show them only a small portion of your life and not your whole life. COMPARTMENTALISATION COMPARTMENTALISATION Typically, I would recommend diversifying the tools you use, so rather than relying for example on Google for e-mail, for maps, for search, for translation, you can find different privacy conscious tools for each of these needs. I would highly recommend that you start with the apps where you don't rely on anyone, like your browser. If you've been using Google Chrome, you could use Firefox, Chromium, you could use Tor browser. There are so many different ones out there and after you find a new browser, why don't you try a new search engine? You could change for example to DuckDuckGo. Some people try some other ones, they try Searx, they try Qwant, there are so many privacy conscious search engines. In Berlin we had some resistance to Google coming to Kreuzberg. Did you hear? It drew a lot of attention onto how Google was infiltrating our life. Yes, that was amazing. Even for Google, I think they never thought this could happen. Indeed, in 2018, Google had to abandon a major campus project in Kreuzberg due to public pressure. I think Berlin is a fairly free city and Berliners have made it clear, in large demonstrations and by challenging politicians, that nobody in Kreuzberg wants a Google headquarters. Like most artists, Max needs social networks to promote his performances, but he's increasingly wary of them. This morning, he has a meeting with members of Reclaim Club Culture. This collective brings together actors from Berlin's nightlife who want to organise themselves independently. There have been many scandals about the exploitation of personal data and the surveillance of users. Our idea is to launch a big campaign, where we invite clubs and the entire Berlin cultural scene to choose together an alternative on which they could post their events. We've done some research. There is a project in development called Mobilizon, which would be an alternative to Facebook Events. I'm mostly in contact with artists and I'm sure that a city like Berlin, which has a unique cultural offer, would be a great starting point for the initiative, and then export it to other cities. CASABLANCA, MOROCCO The protection of privacy affects us all. In the forefront are teenagers, who are big consumers of the social networks Instagram, Snapchat and Tiktok. In Casablanca, teachers at the French high school Louis Massignon decided to show their pupils the hidden side of their favourite applications. Hello! Today we're going to work on social networks. Have any of you ever read the terms and conditions of a social network? I've never read the terms of use because they're very complex words and it's really long, so I've never taken the time. I think if everyone accepts them, I'll accept them too. So, this is an English lawyer who has rewritten these conditions in a language that is very accessible to young people. "While you stay responsible for the information you post on Instagram, we may keep, use and share personal information with companies connected to Instagram. We are not responsible for what these other companies do with your information." In addition to the data you're going to post, you're going to add metadata: the time you logged in, how many times you liked this or that content, etc. They will sell this data to companies that can then sell it to other companies. We'll go on to the second extract. Go on, can you read it, please? Officially, you own the photos and videos you post, but we are allowed to use them. We can also let other people use them anywhere in the world. Others can pay us to use them, but we won't have to pay you for them. Go on. It's uh, it's really shocking. It's like we provide... we provide the wood, we build the fire, but we don't get the heat. Exactly. That's right, but they will have given you the chimney. You can use Instagram for free, but the data is theirs and they will use it. It's always like that. When you sign up for the app, you have a choice, opt out or opt in. We all opted in here because we all have Instagram. We gave our permission without even reading this contract. And I know that when I send a message, for example, to Sofia, that message is not just between us. It's a private message that's not really private. It's like sending a postcard and the postman can read it. Students' privacy is very important to us because if we don't protect their privacy, who will? The risks that they can face on the use of their data are really of three types. There is mainly the exploitation of the data by Big Tech or the companies that have partnerships with these large companies. There is also the risk that their data will be used by hackers who have gained control over their account or their logins. And then, of course, there is the risk of data being used between students for online harassment or other purposes. Cyberbullying on social networks is a scourge that affects many young people. To try to prevent this, teachers are teaching their pupils to protect their accounts better. During the previous session, you remember, we played a sort of game. You had to look for flaws in your classmate's or friend's account. Can I have some feedback on that? I personally did the experiment with Ritcha on her Instagram account. Her Instagram account is private, except that it shows her first name and in her bio there's her age, there's her profile photo and her face. And she doesn't have any posts except for stories where you can see where and when she travels. OK, and so what do you think of her account? It's fine. It could be better, but I'm not the best example either. If you have the time to look through each of the privacy setting options, there are some gems in here. So, you can decide who sees your posts. For example, by default it might be set to public and you may want to reduce it just to the people that you've accepted to your page. You can control which users are seeing your information. Here it says "Do you want search engines outside to link to your profile? Yes or no?" and by default it's set as "Yes". This is a great place to secure the options that are important to you. I don't post, but there are some people who think it's fun to use the same emoji all the time. For example, a whale emoji, to say you're fat, and so we can block these comments. It's called a filter that allows you to hide offensive words or insults. It's a feature of some social networks that allow you to not receive insulting or pornographic images or insulting words in any language, so it's a feature that needs to be activated on your social networks. I was in a minor fight with someone. People didn't really turn against me but just hearing people talking behind your back... Yeah, it's super annoying. You may want to block the person, restrict the comments, block all the accounts, but the person can still, for example, post on their page, or in group conversations, and it clearly makes me uncomfortable. I've created a double identity on social networks especially, and with my friends, so I have two different names. I even have two e-mail addresses. I've created two digital identities on every social network. I have an account with my name, the account where all the people from school follow me, and another one just for those I really trust. But you say that you don't post much on your main account, but on the other one. Does that mean you're more open through your second identity? Yes, I'm more comfortable posting on there. HIGH SCHOOL MEUDON, FRANCE Lilian is among those who grew up with the climate crisis in mind. At 19, this computer enthusiast is involved with environmental activists, a group that is especially targeted. Today, on the eve of a civil disobedience action, he is training activists to secure their data and communications. I saw that quite a few people weren't coming in the end. Yes, two people cancelled. So it's going to be quite participative. We make three small groups and ask people what they've already planned to do on the day in terms of security and then we'll move on to the password part. The aim will really be to make them understand how a password works. So we're going to do a workshop on the fundamental rules of computer security when we do an action. We're going to talk about passwords, which are the fundamental element in computer security, so we'll see how they work, the various attacks to which you can be vulnerable and how to deal with them. The big problem is that people often re-use the same password for several accounts, and if one account is compromised, they all are. I have three versions of one password. I doubt it's the right thing to do. Me too. The solution is to use a password manager. Passwords. On average, we should all learn between 70 and 80 of them by heart. A password manager generates and stores complex passwords and automatically re-enters them each time you log on. So, to protect your password manager you will be asked to create a new strong password. So we thought of a trick, which is that everyone takes a book, picks 3 or 4 words from it and uses these to formulate a password. This sentence will protect all your other passwords, so the goal is to find a bit of a wacky sentence. Unbelievable. This one is very good. You won't forget it. Take three random words, turn a page and point to one. It has to make no sense at all, but the sentence has to be easy to remember. It's the only password you'll have to remember. Did it work? Did you type it in? Basically, it will allow you to store all these very long and very complicated passwords for each app directly in your phone. Make sure no camera is filming your password while you're chatting. Unkown to many, environmental defenders are the most targeted worldwide, given the whole picture, of all activists, and their adversaries are most likely to be corporate and secondarily governments. When you're up against oil and fossil fuel companies and you're up against huge agricultural companies, they have hackers on their payrolls. They're a kind of private militia. You can get people to do hit jobs for you and lots of these guys, they know what they're doing. For environmental activist groups and associations, with the advent of "smart cities", automated video surveillance systems will consider suspicious behaviour to be things like standing still in public spaces for more than 20 minutes. There is an active search to prevent civil disobedience actions. Often it's people who are preparing actions who don't want any leakage, before or after the action. We're here in a totally non-violent way. I'd like to make that clear. So, the aim is to communicate with each other in a secure way. There are instant messaging applications like Signal with messages that disappear after a few hours or a few days at the most. USE SIGNAL DELETE BROWSER HISTORY So, the phone network is pretty simple: you walk and your phone connects to the nearest antenna. With a small antenna you can pick up all the phone calls from dozens of metres away. So you absolutely mustn't send text messages or make normal calls because you have no anonymity, they can listen in to everything. If you don't need a phone, don't bring it. And if you do, if it's really necessary, you must be careful, even buy a seperate phone, which is the best solution. For example, I have two phones, this one is my private life and this one has minimal functions, and if I go on an action, this one stays at home. I bring this one. If we take away the plus 7 degrees that are now predicted for 2100, we are faced with another problem: the mass extinction of biodiversity and the living world. Let's look at the most important thing for tomorrow since you could easily put your whole group at risk. The first rule is that if you don't need your phone, you don't bring it tomorrow. And if you have to, you delete the apps and everything that could identify the people that you have organised things with, that you have talked to. And you absolutely have to use Signal. BERLIN, GERMANY Meanwhile, Max is exploring Mobilizon, the alternative to Facebook Events that is soon to be launched. Today, along with other artists, he is meeting with Mobilizon's developers to discuss how the platform will work. So, why are we still on Facebook as artists, everyone? There is a monopoly on Facebook Events and it's used by every club in Berlin and since we are like a network of clubs, we thought let's spread this goal of a Facebook exodus, because we see a large potential in not persuading individual users to make the change to alternative social media platforms, but actually to set an example. Yeah. We had 15 years of getting used to hosting and delegating everything: the data storage, the server maintenance to Facebook, but if you want a Mobilizon Instance then you have to host it somewhere and you have to pay for the server hosting, but this is what freedom really costs. These are the hidden costs that Facebook and so on would hide from us and compensate with stealing our privacy. So if I got it right, it means that we could do our own local server, what you call an "instance" and downlad the software to it, and give it a name like "Mobilize Berlin", and then we could invite Berlin artists and clubs to come to our platform and then they could federate: that means communicate with the other servers in Germany or worldwide, right? Yes exactly. That's the federation model, it's a philosophical shift. The most famous "federated" platform is the social network Mastodon. FREE SOFTWARE Since its creation in 2016, several million users have chosen to migrate from Twitter to this free alternative. FEDERATION Federation means that there is not a single authority that's in control of the whole network. It means that there are multiple authorities. If you are familiar with e-mail, e-mail is another federated network. You have servers like Hotmail, Outlook, Yahoo, Gmail. You sign up somewhere, you get an e-mail address that starts with your user name and ends with the server you are on and that system allows you to e-mail anyone on any e-mail server, just by using that address. So Federation is a method by which these authorities are spread out. As opposed to for example Twitter or Facebook where they have one server and millions of users. On Mastodon, because it's decentralised, you have a large number of small servers. Each is owned and operated by a different individual or organisation and you get the ability to follow or interact with anyone who is on any other server as well. Max goes to the Mensch Meier, a Berlin nightlife institution. The club has long refused to use Facebook, but has had to do so to attract more people. It would be an ideal candidate to join the Mobilizon adventure. Well, we think that it could be possible to get people away from Facebook, or at least try, in the underground of Berlin's music scene or art scene, to get a lot of people to use a different tool. The hope is there, let's see how far we can go with that. Yes, Mensch Meier is a club that is very political and one of the things that was very important for you was not to use Facebook as a promotion plateform for your events. So why was that in the beginning? Facebook started generating sites for us that we did not want and of course there is a little line which says "unofficial page" and what I did, I started claiming them. And at first it was enough to give them our phone number, but at one point, it was not enough to have our phone number, they wanted the bills for the water and the energy of this place, to prove that we actually were this place. Yes. What? Yes. It's like they wanted more of our data. Do you think there's a possibility for a Facebook exodus? To get a really big community to use an alternative? That could be a possibility with this Mobilizon that we try to build here. So, FREE SOFTWARE ADVOCATE should I perhaps explain a little bit some of the concepts? So, the Fediverse is an open protocol for communication across services. Mobilizon is an event management service which is part of this Fediverse. Within the Fediverse, you have other services. A popular one is Mastodon, which is a Twitter alternative. You have PeerTube, which is a YouTube alternative. Pixelfed, I believe is the name, is an Instagram alternative, Funkwhale is a music streaming alternative. They're based on the same protocol and can communicate with each other. So I can be using Mastodon and you can be making events for Mensch Meier on Mobilizon and I can get your events in my Mastodon stream, even though I'm not using Mobilizon. We could think about some goodies that you get if you join it. I mean, because we are of course still interested in not giving too much power to Facebook, that's already too powerful. So maybe there could be some extra form of content for the events or some extras. - Free shots? - Or whatever. Free shot for every sign up. All the Fediverse tools, so the software in this large federation which all use the same protocol to communicate with each other, finally create a sort of new internet, in which we would have lots of elements which each have different functions, but in which we would finally recreate a full social universe. The impulse for starting Mastodon was my personal belief that there should be a global communication platform like Twitter but it should not be in the hands of a single company. The idea that it's in the hands of the people, that it's decentralised, is better than that. It's more local. It is a noticed fact that Mastodon is a friendlier platform than others. You are part of this global network, but you also have this special view towards your neighbours, the people who are on the same server as you. So you get this community feeling from that. It's easier to feel at ease in environments that are generally much more friendly, where there is no attention-grabbing, because even if we don't realise it, in the end it inevitably impacts our behaviour. And so, in fact, these are much healthier spaces. Hello Mr Meillassoux. My name is WeiKei, I am a researcher from Hong Kong. I have been following your work about digital security. I was hoping to meet to talk about our situation with China. I trust that you will be discrete. I have been as careful as I could but it's still scary. Like thousands of Hongkongers, WeiKei thought she was safe online, but the "Umbrella Revolution", the resistance movement against China, has changed everything. Now, Chinese services can monitor the communications of all Hong Kong citizens. So tell me more: how is the situation in Hong Kong? It's getting worse and worse. You know, the police are becoming more and more violent. The conversation has broken down completely and we are very worried. OK. And you have some kind of a plan? I think the first step for me would be to learn how to secure myself and then I will be able to reach out to other people. I'm actually thinking about a campaign for the general public and I wonder if you would have any contacts of people I can speak to. Because of my experience living in China, I am quite familiar with how the Chinese government actually infiltrates in the general public and how they pinpoint certain individuals. I worry that one day, it will also happen to Hong Kong. For people to continue with their work to fight for our rule of law, for our freedom of speech, they must learn how to protect themselves. - Hello? - Hello, this is WeiKei. So, what sort of occupation are you involved with? I work as a researcher, but then, after the uprising, I became involved in digital security training, so I'm doing a lot of campaigning and contacting people who are actually high risk. And so, now you're back to learn a little bit more about threat-models? Yes, threat modeling is something quite new to me. OK. It will help determine your risk. There are five questions that you can ask yourself. First question: what is it that you want to keep private? THREAT MODELLING Threat modelling. This is getting through the process of thinking: who do I need to protect from, what do I need to keep safe, and what is the worst case scenario? And you start realising: well, OK, my adversary is this. What do I think this adversary is capable of? Is it capable of wiretapping my internet communications or not? Is it capable of getting data out of the provider that I use or not? Is it capable of hacking or not? HONG KONG, JUNE 2019 The adversaries that I'm facing are actually state actors, so they do have financial means and technical power. I think my risk would be exposing my contacts. That's my deepest worry. The worst scenario for me would be to get caught. I would be subject to interrogation and in the worst scenario, tortured. These things are all too common in mainland China. LONDON, UK Internet surveillance has become a major problem for journalists. By contacting them, their sources risk leaving traces online, which could then be used to identify and prosecute them. To address this issue, Julian Assange co-founded WikiLeaks in 2006. This secure platform allows whistleblowers to transmit sensitive documents while preserving their anonymity. WikiLeaks has brought to public attention the abuses committed by the US army in Iraq and Afghanistan. This might be the one here. It has windows on the side, that's a prison van but I don't know if it's coming here. It could be him! Now at the top of the US government's target list, since 2011 Julian Assange has been under threat of extradition to the US, where he now faces 175 years in prison. The first contact problem: this is one of the big issues that we face in journalism. ANONYMOUS CONTACT If we just think about a scenario: you're a whistleblower and you've got important information that you want to disclose to me, you use, let's say your Gmail address, which has your name and that you've used for years, or a normal open line phone call. That has created a permanent record between you and me. I offer different levels of security. So someone who is safe to contact me, contacts me on Twitter, Facebook, by e-mail, and that's it. A person who could potentially have problems if someone knew they had contacted me can reach me on Signal. And someone who faces a very high-level threat, typically someone who was or is working for an intelligence service and who would like to pass me a file, they can use Secure Drop, which is a program set up specifically for contacting investigative journalists anonymously and securely. GERMAN PARLIAMENT, BERLIN GERMAN PARLIAMENT, BERLIN In 2010, I was working for Der Spiegel in London with journalists from the New York Times and The Guardian, in what we called a bunker at the Guardian headquarters. We wrote the first reports on the war in Afghanistan together. When you read them again today, it's really amazing what you could write in simple e-mails back then. And WikiLeaks, they kept sending us very annoying and repetitive requests so that we would encrypt everything and be ever more careful. And we laughed among ourselves about these "big paranoids", like "ha-ha-ha", but we worked together. It was a real journalistic collaboration and today I ask myself: what did I do differently from Julian Assange at that time? I'll go even further: who is next on the list? I mean, what did we do differently? FREE JULIAN ASSANGE If you're a whistleblower, first of all, what you need to be careful with and be very mindful of is how you try to record the information that you are seeing, because if you just plug in a flash drive or USB and try to copy or whatever, that immediately is a red flag. The company has probably got a system that monitors who's removing information from its systems. Most of the big companies do now. They call it "insider threat technology". If you have compromising documents that are of public interest, but you don't really know what to do, the first thing you need to do is to identify the right contact person. Identify the journalist who will be able to release a document while minimising the risk. What I would usually suggest is that the person, if they can buy a cheap new laptop, a notebook or something like that, go to a café, a public wifi network, download the Tor browser, connect to the Secure Drop page, then you can make contact with us through that by sending a message. From there we could probably take the next steps to try and figure out how we can get further information from you without compromising your security or safety. BERLIN, GERMANY To prepare the launch of the Mobilizon platform, Max invited his artist friends to a "CryptoParty". During this informal evening, novices can discover alternatives to Big Tech and learn the basics of online security. CRYPTO PARTY Picture, where am I? Picture, who am I? Picture, where am I going? Picture, where was I? Who was I? Picture, does it still make sense? I take pictures of myself, always of myself, selfies, selfies. I take pictures of myself, always of myself, selfies, selfies. Thank you very much for coming to this nice evening. Most of you are probably not that deep into the topic so it's nice to find out a bit more about what internet privacy is, because I think it's a very important topic that we all should face in these times. We're going to talk about browsing. Are you familiar with what a VPN is? A VPN? A Virtual Private Network? No? Many people use VPNs for privacy reasons by connecting to a VPN and then going to the internet from the VPN. One of the benefits of that is that your IP address looks like it's coming from the VPN, not from your home network and that protects in some sense your identity. Have you heard of Tor before? Do you know how it differs from a VPN? So, Tor is an acronym. It stands for The Onion Router. In some sense, it's similar to a VPN in that your connection to the actual internet looks like it's coming from somewhere else. But with Tor, it doesn't connect to one node, we call it a node, it rather connects to three nodes and then it goes into the internet. These layers are why it's "the onion router". You can have some anonymous connection to the internet. Of course it's not anonymous if you log in to your Facebook account. The next table focuses on the de-googling of Android phones. There are indeed alternatives for most applications. For example, Google Maps can be replaced by Open Street Map or Qwant Maps, so that you don't have to share your geolocation with Google. OPEN STREET MAP FOR ANDROID The step that I don't understand: since I have an Android and a Google account, my whole phone is connected to Google. They know my information anyway. Indeed, not sending any data to Google requires a more complex operation. The Android operating system must be replaced entirely by an operating system such as Lineage which is free and open-source. FREE OPERATING SYSTEM In general, CryptoParty recommends free and open source. You've never heard this term before? Once again? Free and open source. Basically, it belongs to all of us, so the source code is available for other people to take, to use, to modify, to share with other people. It's maximally transparent. FREE AND OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE In French, I describe free software using the three words "Freedom, Equality, Fraternity", because that's exactly what free software is about. "Freedom" means each user is free in using the program. "Equality" because every user has the same rights. "Fraternity" because we encourage users to cooperate with other users. One fairly common kind of malicious functionality is to spy on the user. You must suppose that any non-free program you run is sending data about you and your activities to some company and perhaps to a government. I work with marginalised communities. You know, in America, you find young people in the inner city who are told by tech firms, social media companies, these different platforms: "Express yourself. Be yourself. Tell us your stories. Post your images. Give us your words. This is for you." YouTube, etc. And you know, the law enforcement front door. Law enforcement has contracts with companies that aggregate the data and can spin in and analyse it and slice it any way that they want. And we have these gang conspiracy charges in the United States and in that the police just need circumstantial evidence to tie you to criminal activity, and most of it is through a network effect. So if I post something on social media and you "like" that thing, if I have your number in my phone, that's enough. Your door is going to be kicked in in the morning. They'll pull you out of bed and you'll be arrested. When you're put in harm's way by using some software, you're not excited to use it, you won't think: "Oh, I don't know, how do I move? Can I get my friends to move?" or "who's also on there?". You think "where do I go? I'm ready to go". So I think open source is the people's software and eventually the people will use it because there's no friction, no cost to it. They're actually very hungry and so excited that there are things now that they could use, technology, that makes it so much easier to protect their identity, to protect all they hold dear, and to just enjoy everything about who they are and what they are. CASABLANCA, MOROCCO In recent years, the world of education has begun a major digital transition. In Casablanca, the French high school Louis Massignon embarked on the adventure in 2017. The teaching staff had to choose between different options, in particular those proposed by Big Tech, against the backdrop of the student data collection issue. We tested five or six solutions within the school. There were several solutions, paying solutions, open-source solutions... We looked at the pros and cons of each solution. The tech giants have inevitably offered us immediate, practical, concise, integrated, ergonomic, friendly and pleasant solutions. However, what guides our action and that of all teachers is pedagogical freedom. But what these tech giants were offering was a turnkey solution, and a turnkey solution is generally restrictive. In terms of respect for privacy and the data that is collected, free software was a good fit, and so we have always been inclined to favour open source solutions rather than proprietary solutions. OneNote, which is a Microsoft solution, was also proposed, but it is not well adapted to schools, and as for Google Classroom, we quickly realised that we had to use Google's e-mail and drive to run our classes. It required us and to assign an e-mail address to each pupil, which is not suitable for secondary and primary school pupils, and so the teachers rejected it. The staff finally chose the Moodle platform and the Big Blue Button software, an alternative to Zoom. But this didn't meet with unanimous approval. Free software does indeed have the reputation of being less easy to handle. Moodle is actually a bit off-putting at first. It's not very sexy, it's not very intuitive, it's a bit abrupt at first precisely because it allows teachers to be extremely creative. We can all do absolutely anything we want. It's infinitely adaptable. With computers, you can do anything, that's what's magic. When I arrived, I felt that security wasn't great here. I sent an e-mail to all the teachers, and 50 percent, half of the people gave me their password. And the technique is very simple: you scare people. You just say: "Your account was hacked. Go there to change your password". People click. They don't even see that the URL is wrong. They type in their password, you get their old and new password. It's just stuff like that, IT is just stuff like that. Today, we're going to look at what we call digital hygiene. So is there anyone among you who can define what a cookie is? If you want to enter a site or something, they send you a little message to give your agreement to access the site, and generally we accept. OK, so the cookie is simply a small file that will be on your computer in your internet browser. And it's used a lot in the field of internet advertising, because it can track you from site to site. So the message you were talking about is the authorisation message. You're giving your consent for cookies to be stored on your computer. And that's why, generally speaking, the best practice in digital hygiene is to go straight to the settings on this kind of site and uncheck them. NORMANDY, FRANCE As an IT manager in activist groups, Lilian may have access to sensitive information. One of his tasks is to protect the personal data of activists, which makes him a prime target. We can draw a parallel between ecology and the defence of privacy. On the environmental side, we're heading towards global warming. We're already seeing huge consequences. It's the same with privacy. Big Tech has a monopoly and their tools are easy to use, but for people, change can be very unsettling. I don't think about it any more, it's become part of my daily life, to act like that, to have all these measures that protect my privacy. Today we'll look at Qubes 0S. It would be great if it were accessible to everyone. SECURED OPERATING SYSTEM But it's quite technical to use and it's really for people who need a second identity for militant activities or civil disobedience. The idea is to keep a second identity separate in a different space in your computer. It's based on this idea. You will have a workspace to send and receive e-mails, and if you ever need to communicate anonymously with someone, for example, you will anonymise your IP. Changing your IP address is a first step. Here, Lilian uses obfuscation. This strategy consists of deliberately leaving false traces online to cover up the tracks. In everyday life, you can choose to give false information when registering on a website or to disguise your IP address. The red window means we're browsing the internet normally. There's no protection, we're connected directly. That is our real current IP address. Using this, someone could trace our location, our operator, and a state could, for example, ask an operator to obtain our name and address. And here we go through a VPN. It's an intermediary lending us their IP address, so we're on the same computer, on the same internet, but with a completely different identity. If you have to obfuscate your location or your identity you need to be careful that you're doing it right and it's very easy to make mistakes. If you look at hackers' prosecutions, cases brought against people that have hacked into things, they get caught because of one error in obfuscating their identity. Like the one time that their VPN wasn't actually running. It exposed their IP and location to the operator and authorities. Hello. This is WeiKei. Oh, Hi WeiKei. How are you? Great. I think it's very important that I set up an online alias with you because I use Twitter and Telegram to contact other activists and politicians to see what kind of information they are posting. OK, so you must keep your online life in two separate compartments, that is two separate online devices and logins. Get a privacy enhanced email address with, let's say, ProtonMail to subscribe to various social media. Almost all social media and chat apps, they're going to ask for your phone number to sign up and verify the account. Then you can buy a used phone at a second hand store but be sure you only pay cash. It's called a burner phone. You have to buy a prepaid SIM card for the burner phone. Second, for your online alias to encrypt your communications you have to get yourself a VPN. So you could search which is the best in Hong Kong. And you have to pay that in cash as well. So using the online alias that you construct, it can give you a false sense of security, you still have to be cautious. Use it only for your communications with those involved in your activities, and do that from a public wifi hotspot, not from your home. The choice of operating online pseudonymously: if you are operating in countries where the state or adversaries do not have authority over the online provider that you are using. For example, in a country that doesn't have good human rights records, it's very unlikely that the authority will manage to subpoena data out of Twitter or Facebook. Be cautious of the fact that using some types of internet networks like Tor or VPN could flag you. In some countries, using those technologies is actually illegal. So it could be even a point of attack from a legal point of view. Since 2020, a new Chinese law directly targets Hong Kong opponents. In response, WeiKei now runs workshops for activists on online safety rules. Well, thank you for coming here. Today we're going to talk a little bit about security. But before I get into it, I want to talk about the new security law. Who has heard about this security law in Hong Kong? As soon as the government doesn't like you for any reason, they can send you to China, to be tried under the Chinese court and that's the end of you. So you know, we also need to escalate our security tools. It's actually really important to encrypt your communications and encrypt your mails. Sure. It's about your comrades too. If you're busted, your friends are busted. From what I heard from other activists in my circle, they don't even know what encryption is. It's scary. If I'm communicating through the internet from this computer, I can send that unencrypted and then anyone on the way, my wifi, my local router, the ISP, whatever else it went through, all those things could potentially read it. But if I have it encrypted, with PGP, it can't be read easily. So, we use 2 keys: 2 numbers. One that is simply messing up my message to you, like crumpling it up. For the sake of understanding. So, If I pass it on, all the people here in between can only pass it on. And when you receive that, you have the secret key, the other number to decrypt it. It's like an opener, the key that opens and this is where we have to learn how to do this. In terms of escalating measures or protocols, I think these are something you can teach us. What's more important is that people do it and cooperate. I think that there is a psychological barrier. If people can get over this barrier, I think it's doable, it's never too late. You can take the first step anytime. Many of them don't do that because they think it's already too late, that they're already being targeted. It's not necessarily the case. In civil society, there's a lack of ressources and expertise, compared to a very high capacity of the adversary to breach into electronic devices and intercept communications. Then you need to start thinking away from this strict digital security aspect and more about the operational security. When you think about operational security, you think about changing your behaviour to mitigate the damage. So I'll use a certain type of device for certain types of communications that are at a higher risk of getting intercepted. And I'll separate that from my personal life. These considerations often help much more than buying hardware which are regarded as more secure. DAMASCUS, SYRIA An operational security error is what could have cost Dlshad Othman his life. Like WeiKei, this unremarkable Syrian has seen the political situation in his country change abruptly. Like her, he opposed an authoritarian regime with unlimited capabilities. At the beginning, I was this person who not only believed, but who was confident that actually digital security or these tools can be enough to help you protect yourself and my focus was on teaching these tools, how to use it, click here, open here, install this tool. But then something happened to me when I had to leave the country because of an operational security mistake by a Western journalist and my information was revealed to the Syrian government. It was so important for Syrian activists to talk to Western journalists so they could tell the world what was going on. So the Syrian electronic army started targeting known Western journalists. The journalists got a link, a fake link, and they clicked on it and the Syrian electronic army got full control over their machine. At that time, a lot of people got caught because it was easy and the Syrian government had the capabilities to analyse internet traffic and identify users and arrest them. It was 1 a.m. when I received a Facebook message telling me that this journalist got arrested, so I needed to do something. There's no way you can get a burner phone and SIM card in Syria. You can't, you need to sign a contract, they know who you are, your fingerprints, all these things. So now they know who I am and they know my name so they can go to the mobile provider service operator and ask for my location to find where I am. I went to the city centre, the centre of Damascus. It was 1:30 a.m. and I took the SIM card and crushed it, threw it away, and then I became totally offline. No wifi, no internet, no GSM, nothing. LONDON, UK Julian Assange's extradition trial opens in London. In Belmarsh high security prison, these five weeks of hearings, closed off to cameras, are presided over by Judge Vanessa Baraitser. The US request the extradition of Mr Assange for the unlawful publication of classified documents related to the Afghan and Iraq wars allegedly endangering the life of informants working for the US. The prosecution of a journalist for publishing confidential documents is a historic first in the West. The profession is concerned about the legal example it could set. WikiLeaks put in place a rigorous process to remove the names of sources from all documents before publication, associating with local media partners in different countries. WikiLeaks pioneered in several journalistic fields: by publishing source documents online, initiating large journalistic partnerships and creating a secured platform for whistleblowers that was replicated by all major newspapers. With WikiLeaks, how does it work? You sign a confidentiality agreement saying that you will respect the embargo, you will respect the security protocols, you communicate through secure messaging and then you have access to the document in a secure way and ideally you use Tails. Tails is a removable operating system. It fits on a USB key, an SD card. You restart your computer on Tails and then all communications go through Tor. It's a computer that's not linked to your identity, so it gives you an additional layer of anonymity. When the threat model is as extreme as it can be, we usually try and work in what we call an air-gaped environment, which is to have computers that have never and will never connect to the internet and we will only open certain encrypted communications on those air-gaped machines. In New York in the Intercept office, they built a secure compartmented facility where it's almost like Alcatraz. There's metal through the walls and it blocks all signals coming in. With WikiLeaks, my threat model was the highest I've ever had. It lasted a week since the documents were then made public, so there was nothing else to get into my computer, but when you work on NSA or CIA documents, they're the best in the world at intercepting telecommunications. Before his arrest in April 2019, Julian Assange lived for seven years as a refugee in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London. Being tracked 24/7, he became the most monitored journalist on the planet. I was employed by a private security firm at the Ecuadorian Embassy. In 2015, our chief declared that we were now working in the "Premier League", for "American friends". We installed camera surveillance with stream capacities and microphones in all the rooms of the embassy. Our "American friends" seemed to be obsessed by monitoring the meetings with lawyers and other journalists. More extreme measures such as kidnapping or poisoning Mr Assange were also considered. Well the embassy, having Julian inside, became probably the most surveilled place in the world. In what we could describe as a "big brother" experiment, where the only person that could never leave the place was him. Where every single corner of the embassy was recorded. They put a special, very sensitive hearing device under the bottom of the fire extinguisher and in the lady's toilet behind the towel rail. ASSANGE'S FATHER Julian and the lawyers used to meet in the ladies' toilet because they thought that it was not bugged. So we would write notes to each other. And of course, when you pass a note to each other you had to ensure that you turned it over so that the camera could not see what was written on it. The only 100% secure way to communicate with another human is to get a piece of ceramic tile or a piece of glass and put one piece of paper on it so there's no indentation under it from what you write on the piece of paper. You then put your head under a towel, cover it, and you write your message. Even if there's a camera in the room they can't see. If there's a recording device, they can't hear anything. You finish writing and the other person goes under the towel. You let them read it and reply if they need to. Then you rip up the piece of paper and you burn it and pound it into dust, and scatter it to the winds. It's like going back to what John Le Carré calls "Moscow rules", which is the old trade spycraft, where it's meeting in person, using secret marks to show that the drop place is safe or insecure and you've been followed. It's old school spying to get around this new electronic spying we're all subject to. When it was created, the internet promised a new space of freedom. But today, it is mostly controlled by big companies and states. To preserve our privacy, we have to learn to protect ourselves. The problem is that no major political force has managed to articulate a vision for what this digital world might look like, where it's not run by these rather unimaginative firms who only think of selling advertising. The madness is how we have organised the entire system, where we cannot conceive of infrastructures with a different political economy, where data might be owned by citizens together and not by the firms that offer us the infrastructures. Those kinds of questions are missing from the debate. The focus is now on Brussels. Indeed, the European Union is the institution that has shown the greatest willingness to bring order to the Wild West of personal data. By joining forces at the European level, with the Member States, we can really set a new global standard. The General Data Protection Regulation which regulates the tracking of users, including by means of cookies, has already marked a historic turning point at the international level. But as a last resort, I think we will have to dismantle the Big Tech companies. Before we get to that, there are other solutions: developing competition and pushing companies to make data protection the strength of their business models. Other services are possible and some of them can be funded and offered and built differently with different respect for privacy, with a different political economy of data. That's happening in local enclaves. But there has to be a logic that informs that, and you need resources, you need billions going into this. And for billions to flow into this, you need to have a very different set of policy priorities at the national and the European levels. BERLIN, GERMANY It's D-day for Max and his partners. After two years of preparation, they launched their independent platform mobilize.berlin. Now connected to thousands of other platforms, it is a new step in the development of the free internet. Today we are here to celebrate Mobilizon and launch the website. So we invite you to go onto the platform's address, it's online, there's some really cool features, it's connected to the Fediverse, that's the future of open source, free and decentralised social networks. That's it. Sign up! Think about where our freedom comes from. The only reason we have any freedom, is because of people in the past who have been willing to make some practical sacrifices for their freedom. We don't need thousands or millions of people to be heroes and take grave risks. We just need thousands, maybe millions of people to suffer a little inconvenience. But it all depends on saying "No". If you occasionally say, "No I won't do that because it would mean giving up some of my freedom", you will be advancing the campain to win back our freedom in the digital domain. A new form of global interaction must be created. A new era is upon us, where we raise our hand and go and challenge the giants. Because mankind will not be free as long as Facebook rules.
