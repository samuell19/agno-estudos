Uh, excuse me, sir? Sir? Sir, uh, are you the janitor of this building? Don't never come up on anybody like that. What's the matter with you? I'm sorry. You have the apartment 5-F? This is 148 Suffolk Street, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Can I look at the apartment, please? - Yeah, what do you want to do? - Well, I just... I'd like to see it. I don't know how... you know, if I want it, but I'd like to see it. Well, you know, it ain't furnished. Well, a little nail up there would... I leave these lights on 'cause you had about 12 guys up here the other day. All right, now, first of all, you've got a shelf up here. You can put everything up here. And you've got your water. And you've got a combination bathtub and dishwasher here. And you can just, uh... Oh, is... what's that? That's, um... Could someone take that out? Yeah, well, you can take it out. Here you've got a great view, you know? And, uh, only one flight up, and you've got the sky. Now, over here, this is my pride and joy. This is an oven that's kept here, right, that... that you open here... You take it as-is, right, or you don't take it at all. How much did you say this place rents for? $75 a month. $75? Yeah. I didn't know that we had this much furniture in here. Well, yeah, but... - How much is it, then? - $66.75. Sixty-six... well, it says in the paper... Now, look, I know what it says in the paper. $45. I didn't know all this furniture was in here, all right? You know, and the mattresses go with it. You know? And here, over here... you don't need to look out there, because there's the view, right there. - I'll take it. - Okay. Will you shut that door? Leave the coffee and corned beef on the table. What the hell are you... I don't want any magazines, kid. You mind? Look what you're disturbing here, huh? Where do you think you are, in your own house? - I'm sorry. - Look at that. Is that gorgeous? You see that cleavage? Huh? Where you gonna get that? You don't get that in a Fellini film. You get that in a Banner film. Now, this is your public, you understand? These guys come from every walk of life... middle class, rich, poor. Don't pay any attention. Things go on in there. I shouldn't even tell you what goes on in there. You come into one of these theaters, you do not go into the men's room. You understand? You got that straight? That's one of the laws. Is that art? - What's going on in there? - Don't pay any attention to it. Go on, get out from in here. Pervert. Leave him alone. Who knows where he's been. She looks inhibited, right? You know why she looks inhibited? She hasn't had the right direction. She has not been told who she is in this film. That girl does not want to screw anybody. She wants to screw the man of her life, so who do they put her in with, huh? Some weirdo with gold hair. Yeah, that's funny, huh? What's gonna happen when her mother sees that picture, know what I mean? Kids should grow up with a feeling of beauty about their bodies, right? I mean, my little boy, my 6-year-old boy, walks around with a towel around him all the time. I mean, why is that, huh? I don't see my daughter doing that. Hey. That's all right. He means well. This man is obviously somebody who needs a movie. But not this movie. If it were this movie, he wouldn't be doing this to me. He wouldn't be putting his hands on my balls. Now, you want to make a film for me, you've got to have a property. Kid, kid, this is real estate. What is this? Is this gonna sell movies? Yes. This is gonna sell movies, a tall building? So what? So that's a phallic symbol. I know what that is. - No, it's not. - You trying to teach me something? A tall building? Listen, I used to watch Superman when I was a little kid, too, you know what I mean? You're not gonna teach me anything new with just a tall building. The reason I've come to see you is because I know that you're a good producer... Take a look at that top floor. - Who took this picture? - I took these pictures. You know what you've got on that top floor? The top floor is an old woman. That's not an interesting picture. - An old woman? - Yes! No, no! You'd better have your eyes checked, kid. Look what he's showing me. Look what's gonna sell money, right? You got the right idea. You like titties, right? - Right? - Yeah. You'll buy this before you'll buy that picture, won't you? - I'll show you something. - Go on, show him something. Go on, see if you can make a sale. - You see, these are four windows. - It's gorgeous, isn't it? You could really go home and jerk off to that, couldn't you? Wait a minute, Mr. Banner! You could really go home and put your thing right through the window. These are the most interesting windows of this side of the building. There are 270 windows. - I'm taking your word for that? - Yes. Now, what I have, see, I have this telescope here, see? I've got this telescope, and I get the activities of all these... the secretaries, the revolutionary, the hippy... young hippies... this playboy down here, and then up there, you've got a housewife. That's what I don't understand. How do you know they live there? How do I know they live there? I've been watching them. I have all the photographs. I have all the film, the 8mm film. And then I've got this telescope, you see, and I do this. And you set it up here, and, you know, it's what I call "peep" art, and I think it's fantastic, because you get all these private moments. You get all these people together, and they don't know they're being watched. Its not like in those photographs in that bookstore, but these are real activities. You think people are stupid? You think people are stupid? You think people don't know when they're being watched? No, they don't know. You think I don't know that you're watching me now? The only compromise in this is when someone pulls the blinds. - Why don't you look? - I'm gonna see what you see, right? Look on the 16th floor. You think people don't know when they're being watched, right? Mr. Banner, can I just... Don't "Mr. Banner" me. You're getting me nervous. - All right, now, look in that window. - Call me Joe. - What? - Oh, there she is. Go ahead, look, look. Just watch, watch. - Can you see her? - Hey, hey! I see, like, a very funny broad with a red towel, right? Right, right, right, right. Now, you like it. I'm glad you like it. - What's your name? Jon, right? - Jon, right. 280 windows. Confessions of a Peeping Jon. Oh, yeah, well, that's... Okay. - That's what? - Okay, okay. - You patronizing me? - No. You gonna give me the money? You putting up with me? I'm putting up with you. - You don't have to put up with me. - I'm not putting up with you! I'm just saying, give me the money, and I'll do it. I told you, I'm scared of heights. I'm nervous up here. You need a lens. I like the idea. It's a good idea. It's a good idea, kid. It's a good idea. Too bad you don't have a lens. You need a lens! What, are you gonna work with that piece of crap? What are you doing to my equipment? I'm waiting for her to take off... I could see her from here better! - Look at this! - Well, I know I need a lens. You see these? These are $12 prescription glasses. I can see probably clearer. Look at that. I have no trouble now seeing her. I'll get you a lens from Harry. You go down to Harry, he'll send you to ABC Camera, you go down, you get the lens, you get the works. - You will? - You better deliver. I will, I promise! You get a lens, you sit in your bathtub, you'll be able to take pictures. Oh, Mr. Banner, that's fantastic. Can I shake your hand? When you get to know me better, we'll shake hands. Right now it's strictly business, you understand? That's great, Mr. Banner. Listen, how much money can you give me? Don't worry about it. Whatever it costs. What do you need? Well, I need about... I'd like to have about $2,000. $2,000? All right, so I'll give you about $2,000. Get out. You're gonna give me $2,000? - I'm gonna give you $2,000. - You're really gonna give me $2,000? That's right, I'm a schmuck, I know. I trust you, kid. I know, I know, I know. I've got a good heart. You remind me of... What's the difference who you remind me of? He was killed in the war, anyway. He was a good kid. He went away. I was gonna teach him the business, you know that? What business was that? - You trying to make fun of me? - I'm sorry. What? I'm taking you in off the street, you're making fun of me? My cousin Marshall. My cousin Marshall would have had this job, would have had the opportunity that you're gonna have. Mr. Banner, I'm very sorry. I'd like to shake your hand. I'm sorry. Can I expect a check from you? You just tell Harry to send the bills to me. And what you're actually doing is setting the camera motor on, and you can just take pictures of yourself. That's right. You just push this button. Like this? And as far as the sound is concerned, the sound is recorded in this microphone. - Oh, I see. - Right here. Does it have... what do you...? A zoom? Yes. Now, I'll show you how to operate the zoom. You just twist this like so... and your subject will come closer and closer and closer. Yeah, I see. - Isn't that great? - I can do that, right. - Isn't that great? - Yes. Now, are you familiar with the exposure? No, I don't really know anything about it. Well, you see this little ring around the center here? Yeah, right here? Well, you just turn that slowly and slowly, and the camera will automatically set itself for the proper exposure. - What's exposure? - That's right. Well, it's the correct lightness and darkness of the picture. Oh, yeah, I see. The light and the dark. Yes. You see how that works? Now, you want to try the zoom now? Yeah. Let's zoom right across the room, right over there. Okay. I'll take that man's picture right there. You're getting him right in the picture. Uh-huh. But it's all out of focus now. - Well, we'll fix that. - Oh, I see. You get sound just like Hollywood. You can sing. They can do anything they want, anything. Who's there? Jon Rubin. - Jon Rubin? - Yes, Jon Rubin. Hi. How are you? I'm your computer date. Computer date? Yes. ABC Computer Dating. Very nice to meet you. I never ordered a computer date. If you didn't, somebody who certainly looks very much like you did. As a matter of fact, you look much better than your photograph. As a matter of fact, you're quite a knockout! Well, I think we have approximately 15 minutes. Do you know my name? Well, of course I know your name. Jo Ann Larch. - Judy. - Judy? - Judy Bishop. - Oh, Judy Bishop? Ha ha! Very funny. You've got a very good sense of humor. As a matter of fact, I punched that in. I'm very glad. Well, let's get going, will you, because we don't have much time. Well, I think there must be some mistake. Hello, is this ABC Computer Dating? Yes, my name is Jon Rubin, and there seems to be some mistake here. I'm at the apartment of a Judy Bishop, 505 LaGuardia Place. A Judy Bishop of 505 LaGuardia Place... and, uh... uh... it seems that there's some mistake, because I have come here under the assumption that we were to have a date tonight, and, uh, it seems that Miss Bishop knows nothing about it... and so I would like to find out what's happening here. I happen to have tickets for Cinema Sociables, dining, and dancing, and I have a cab waiting outside, and it seems that there's just nothing here now, and I'm quite upset about it, and I seem to be feeling quite degraded. Now, could you please tell me what the story is? There seems to be some mistake? There is a mistake? It's 505 LaGuardia Place in the Bronx? Well, I'm... I'm... You should be sorry! You should absolutely be sorry! What? Well, I'm afraid I'll just have to report it to the Better Business Bureau, yes. Well, the least you can do is send my $3 back. Do you know my address? That's right. Goodbye. What's that? Oh, nothing, nothing. L... Well, I spoke to them on the phone, and they said that, uh, that there must have been some mistake. The LaGuardia Place that I was told to go to is in the Bronx, so I really feel terrible. - What a shame. - Yes, I feel like quite a fool. Oh, don't be silly. Well, I do. I feel as if I've degraded myself and embarrassed you, and I really, really feel very bad. I'm quite sorry, and now I have these tickets, and I can't do anything with them. I mean, uh, I can't get my money back, because they're non-returnable. Well, there must be somebody... And I can't call anyone, you know. I'd feel kinda silly just calling a girl now. ...some girl in New York City who's free tonight. Wonder what I did...? Oh. Ah! Here they are. Yeah, I just don't know. I guess the only thing to do is... Oh, don't be silly! No. Well... Well, I don't know. I just can't call a girl now. There must be someone. Oh, listen, um... I-I don't want to be rude or, you know, crass or vulgar or impolite. I certainly wouldn't want to do that... I've already embarrassed you enough... but I was just thinking, um... perhaps, uh... perhaps, uh... ...you would like to go. - Yes! You would? All right. Oh, actually, I had a date, but I-I cancelled it because it, uh, it snowed. - You could go? - Yeah. Oh, fantastic. Well, come on, let's go. Oh, wow. What a beautiful movie. It's so personal to me, that... that child-woman. At times, she's a little girl, terrified by the brutality and ugliness of reality, and she has to talk in rhyme to preserve her fantasy world. And then, at times... the woman... this sexual-driven, passionate woman... bursts forth like a ripe fruit. So much wanting. And then that frightens her, and she has to go back into the little girl again and talk in rhyme. Yeah. You know, tragedy is a funny thing. Oh, wow. It certainly is. Just breaks my heart. You know, I think I understand this movie really well because I had a personal experience. I was going with Danny in high school, and we were at Jim Thorpe High. And Danny... Danny and I were really close, except there wasn't any magic, you know what I mean? We weren't really... And, um, we went to this party together, and, well, this person was there. This person, he was like the high school heartthrob, you know? Everybody was crazy about him. And I never thought he'd look at me or anything. I never thought he'd pay any attention to me, and suddenly, out of the blue, he began talking to me, and then he began dancing with me, and, well, we were communicating. We were talking about things I'd never talked to anyone about before. We were really close. And he said to me, "Would you leave with me? We're two special people, and we should leave together," he said. And I said yes, because it was so special. And, well, we got into his car, and we drove to the quarry, and it was a very beautiful night, and... well... I had all these feelings inside of me that I'd never had for anyone before, and, well, I gave myself to him, completely. Oh. Oh, you did? And, um, it was very beautiful, I-I thought. And, uh, when it was over... I-I said to him... and it wasn't because I wanted to get engaged or I wanted him to pin me or I wanted to go steady or anything like that. It was because I had for him the biggest feeling I'd ever had for anyone in my whole life. Ever. And I said to him, "I love you." And I looked in his face... and he had the most sick, ugly, peculiar grin on his face. He was laughing at me! Do you mind if I put my hand here? No. Well, as you can imagine, I mean, everything inside me went cold. I became inwardly hysterical. And I-I looked up at him, and in my nakedness, l... you may not believe this... I said to him, "Roger, Roger, look at me. Roger, Roger, what do you see?" That reminds me of something that happened to me. I was coming home. I was living with a girl, Barbara, a few years ago, and, uh... it was her birthday, and I came home, and I had presents and a cake and candles, and all kinds of confetti and crepe paper, and I was rushing up the stairs, ecstatic. I opened the door very quietly and crept in, and I heard the shower running. Well, I opened the door to the bathroom... and I hear some voices. And all of a sudden I open the shower curtain, and then, there are... there she is with another person. They were... they were... they were naked. And the funny thing about it was, he had this kind of laugh, this kind of grin, this kind of evil grin, and it... it really threw me, and I naturally ran out of the place in a state of shock. I didn't know what to do, and... But, you know, come to think of it, his name was Roger, because I was introduced to him once before. It was? And he... Did you say this Roger was from Jim Thorpe, PA? Jim Thorpe, PA? What was his last name? Parks. Roger Parks. Roger Parks? Well... well, I'll be damned. Do you know that's the same Roger Parks who was in the shower with Barbara? Do you know that? That same son of a bitch was in the shower with Barbara! That goddamn... ...son of a bastard! - Oh, no! Oh! Oh, look what I've done. Oh, I'm sorry. - Oh, are you all right? - In a moment of passion, I... I got excited. I'm sorry. I must've acted like a fool, and I've ruined the pizza. I'm... I'm sorry. Please forgive me. It's just that... It's all right. Poor you. Oh, you poor thing. That's terrible. We were both victimized by that... that... that brute, that... that... that... Oh, l... oh, I get so... Oh, I'm... I get so... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Forgive me. Please forgive me. You poor thing. You poor thing. Be gentle with me. I will, Judy, but not now. We've both had a very exhausting evening, and we're both drained, and... Well, when? Well, as I've said, we're both very drained, and we've had quite an unusual experience this evening, a wonderful experience. I happen to be a person of the weather, and I hear that tomorrow the forecast is not too good. It's going to be cloudy and rainy all day, but Sunday is going to be sunny and beautiful, and I think that's the day we should get together and rendezvous. This is the wonderful view we have from the living room and bedroom windows. It's really nice, because how many people in New York can look out their window and see this much space? Usually they're just looking into the side of another building or into somebody else's window. This is the housing project across the street. It's not nearly as nice as the one we live in. This is our housing project, see? I don't like that one at all. This one is really pretty. It's really modern. And the cement blocks, all one color. We live on the sixth floor. Let's see, not counting the big windows on the bottom, go up one, two, three, four, five, six, and over to the... let's see... second and third window, that's right. Let's see now, l... Um, this is my elevator. It's an automatic elevator, so we don't need a doorman. And, um... - Oh. Hi, Gerrit. - Hello, Mrs. Mitchell. This is a neighbor of mine. Lives upstairs. And, um... Can you hold the door, 'cause I'm trying to take a... Um, thank you. What are you putting up there? - It's a poster. - I think I'll come in and ride with you. What is that you're putting...? Are you allowed to put things up in an elevator like that? I don't know. What is that? Is that a naked girl? - Yep. - My goodness. Well, what, is it an advertisement for something? Yeah. What? A play. I'm trying out my new movie camera. Gerrit is a student at... where do you go to school, Gerrit? - NYU. - Are you in the play? Uh-huh. Oh, are you really? I guess that's why you grew a beard, huh? A lot of actors have beards, don't they? Are you gonna leave that there in the elevator? - Mm-hmm. - We'll have to come see it. Shoot 'em! ...black in America? Why not? You live in America, why can't you learn to be part of it? 'Cause I'm not black. Well, now you can find out what it's like to be black. I'd like to talk to you. You have the kind of face that looks like... - No, I'm real busy. - You are busy? Why are you so busy you don't want to know what it's like to be black? - Sorry. So I'm busy. - You're very busy? Do you have black people in your neighborhood, sir? Excuse me, sir, do you know what it's like to be black in America? - Say what? - To be black in America. - Yes. I do. - You do? Would it interest you to learn more about black people and how it is to be black in this society... to go through the experience? I don't know what are you talking about. Excuse me, sir, do you know what it's like to be black in America? You've got to go back to work? Are there any black people at your job? Black people have been imitating white people for so long, they know how to act like you all act, so, I mean, what's your whole problem? Why can't you go through the black experience? I don't have any problem. I don't care if you're green, blue, or yellow. We know. We understand that. That's an admirable attitude. Have you ever thought about what it would be like to be a black woman? She doesn't look black. It's a question of understanding it from the inside as opposed to understanding it from the outside. It's easy to say, "I live next door to somebody." That's just saying that you're liberal. I'm not a liberal, I'm a radical. I mean, you know, you're not talking to a white liberal walking around the Village. You know, we have been on many marches in Harlem. We've done lots of things. We haven't been born today, you know. All of intellectual white America's been on marches and given to the NAACP and attended lectures. How do you expect to be where you are now if we don't help you? - I'm not saying that. - We know why we're here. Because you helped us stay there. Right. You have an obligation if somebody's a human. Well, of course. I understand that. And it's not attending marches, and it's not going to lectures, and it's not giving money to the NAACP. Just what do you want from us? I want you to check this out, that's what I want. Come and see our show, Be Black Baby. Listen, we know all about this. This is nothing new to us. Intellectual experiences don't have nothing to do with physical experiences. You think we're unimaginative? We've been all through this. It's not about your imagination. It's about what you live, lady. And you can't intellectualize it, you understand? You have to live it. It isn't a matter of intellectualizing. That's what you just said... you have a good imagination. Come on, I'll owe it to you, you bastard! ...well, of course there are. - You have anything to do with them? - But of course. Like what? We see them in the morning, we say hello to them, just like to anybody else. Look, there are now scholarships. If you want to take advantage of the situation now... You gotta kiss somebody's ass to get a scholarship. Oh, come on. A large part of your clients are black, aren't they? Yes. Can I ask you if you ever feel guilty... I mean, if your conscience ever bothers you? Never at all. Never at all, my friend. Do you know, do you have any idea what I'm talking about? I think I have a good idea what you're talking about. Yeah, well, I'll tell you what I'm talking about, man. You got stuff in this store that is the shoddiest merchandise I've ever seen. You have committed your life, you have made it your life's work to suck in the poorest people in this town and sell them the shoddiest trash I've ever seen for the most blown-up, exorbitant prices I could ever have expected to see anywhere. You are a pillar in the system that is oppressing the black people and all the poor people in the world, no matter what color they are, man! Do you realize that? Are you aware of that at all? I'm aware of everything, but I'm really surprised you're even talking this way. You notice our prices that we charge over here? Do you know what we sell over here? - Incredibly over... - We are the cheapest. We are the cheapest. We defy anyone to undersell our prices! We give everything away. But you're being a tool, mister! I'm being used? I'm being used? For what price? You being used to suck in people, mister. Man, you got the wrong impression. No, I ain't, because you tell people to buy this garbage, mister! I tell people to buy this garbage. You know why? Because... because... because I'm being paid! You tell Puerto Rican people, you tell crackers, you tell black people... Well, nobody's twisting their arm to walk in that door! Nobody's twisting you to stand out here and sell this bullshit! For a price! For a price, man! That means you done sold yourself, right? I ain't sold myself! It's a matter of opinion! But that's what you're doing, right? Telling people to buy this garbage! That's your opinion! - That's what it is! - Well, I'll tell you what... ...get a police and have me arrested! No, no, brother, I want to appeal to you. I don't want to get no police on you. - Why you want to appeal to me? - Because you a black man! You damn right! "There's just nothing you can do. It's uncanny, but there's nothing you can do." I'll start crying there. That'll take about three... I'll give myself three minutes just to make sure the crying and everything... really build it up. If that doesn't get her, I don't know what will. If she doesn't say, "Oh, Jon, is there anything I can do?" And I'll say, "I can't ask you." "Oh, please, Jon, take me now." And I'll say, "Oh, oh, Estelle... I-I mean... I mean, Judy." And she'll say, "No, no, Jon, say what's ever in your heart. "If it's Estelle, it's Estelle, "and I know that sooner or later, you'll love me, and everything will be fine." And I'll say... Let's see, that oughtta take about two more minutes. That'll take, uh... And, "Oh, Jon, take me." And so, let's see, I'll get her up against the ledge here, and then I'll kiss her a few times, and then I'll start undoing her blouse. Make sure she's facing the camera. I'll have to turn her. It'll be a little awkward, but I'll get her there. Let's see... that oughtta... Yeah, that's 26-and-a-half minutes... 26-and-a-half minutes... It's now 9:57. I have to be there at 10:00. It's 9:57 plus 20 seconds. That gives me 40 seconds. 39... 38... 37... 36... 35... 34... 33... 32... ...11... 10... 9... 8... 7... 6... 5... 4... 3... 2... 1. Well, coat. Coat. I guess you'll want to know why I have two watches here. You see, the left watch, which is my uncle's, runs correctly, and the one which is my watch, this one on the right here... uh, I've got to explain this to you... happens to be about five minutes off, so if you notice that I keep looking at it every few seconds, it's only because I'm trying to check it now, because I paid $30 to have it fixed. What's for breakfast? Uh... me! Ha ha ha! Very funny! No, what's for breakfast, seriously? Huh? I'd like a four-minute egg. I'd like a four-minute egg, not sooner or faster. Oh, come on, forget about breakfast. I'll bet you cook just like my mother. - Mother? - Yes. You want a mother figure, honey? No, I mean, I bet you make a four-minute egg just like my mother made fantastic four-minute eggs, though my mother did do one thing... and that was that she'd make me go to dancing school all the time, and I met a girl named Estelle there, and Estelle was the only girl who would dance with me, though, and sometimes, uh, Estelle and I would... would... would be alone in the country. For example, once we were on a rock, and we made love and... you know what happened to Estelle? Make love to me, sweetie! Well, something happens to... she... she's... - Come on. - Estelle was killed. Estelle was killed. We were on a... We were driving along, and, um... all of a sudden, the car turned over, and rolled over about 23 times. Come on! I walked out without a scratch, and Estelle was damaged beyond repair. You're kidding! That's terrible! The car burst into flames, and she was burnt to a crisp. Why are you telling me this? Well, I just want to tell you, I'm a very sensitive person, and I can't just jump into bed with you like this. But I fell in love with you! Come on! Well, I-I love you, too, but it's just that... uh... uh... you know, it's... And then Estelle and I went to, uh... well... - Oh, please. - I feel very badly about Estelle now. - This was a few years ago... - This is not the time for Estelle. ...and now I see a psychiatrist about five times a week, and he told me that, uh... well, he told me that I can't have sex except under certain conditions, and he said that it's a matter of time, it's a matter of time. - I have to get to know somebody first. - I'll be gentle! - No, no. - I'll be gentle. I have to get to know you. Look, would you do me a favor? Would you wait about 25 minutes? Wait? Why? I-I can't explain it. It's difficult. It's difficult. I can't explain. Oh, let me comfort you, sweetie. If you could only wait a few minutes. - Just a few! - Here, lie down. Okay. Just wait, though, because I have to get to know you first. Right. Just lie down. I mean, I just don't... it's not proper... I just don't jump into bed with every girl I see. I-I like you. I just don't go around flattering people and saying how much I like them unless I really like them. Right. So, why can't you... can you wait a few minutes? Sure. Good, good. I-I forgot to tell you something else, too. I-I don't have any, uh... - Are you protected? - Oh, the hell with that! I'd like to get some prophylactics or contraceptives. Well, which would you like... a prophylactic or a contraceptive? Well, I just want... What's for a man? A man? Well, I mean, it depends on what your situation is. Well, what's the best thing you have for right now... I mean, for a man or for a woman? What would be the best thing that you'd have? - For right now? - Yeah, yeah. This minute? Well, not this... you know... well, you know... Just a minute. I've got something. Something might happen. Now, um, these are prophylactics. Trojan, you see? These are of quite fine quality. I have them either in unlubricated or lubricated. Uh, which is the better? Which is the stronger? Well, it depends, you know, on what you like. I'll demonstrate one for you. Now, you see, this is unlubricated. Yeah. I see. Yeah. Is it strong, though? Is the rubber...? Oh, very, very good. Here, see? - It really is very durable. - It's very strong. No holes or anything. Gee, you can see through it, as a matter of fact. Yeah, it's very thin, for sensitivity. Oh, and now for your wife, sir. This just came to us from Copenhagen. This is a personal vibrator. You see? It comes in three colors... pink, light blue, or "natural." Now, the batteries are in here. They're included in the price. - You mean this is for...? - Marvelous? For a woman? Yes, a massage of the... as you see on the box. - You see? - Oh! For those hard-to-get-at places. That's good. This is Vagabond lotion. See? Smell that. Isn't that... isn't that marvelous? Smells a little strange. The thing about Vagabond is, it has no bitter-tasting chemicals, so once you apply it, you see, the alcohol evaporates very quickly, leaving a sweet residue on the skin. Oh, I see. As they advertise it, "Suddenly you're delicious!" What I did was, I computed the time on my watch, the 26-and-a-half minutes that it would take me to seduce her. 26-and-a-half? Yeah, 26-and-a-half minutes, and I set the camera onto the clock radio, and I had this red lightbulb... Red lightbulb! I used to do that when I was a kid. And the camera was on, and I could see it from her apartment. So, as you'll see now... see, this is the preliminary stuff. - She's cute. - Yeah, yeah. She a pro? Uh... well, I think she is, as a matter of fact. But she's really great. See, what happens now is, see, we go down for a few minutes. That's good. You build up the ecstasy. Watch! We're gonna come up, and I rip her clothes off! It's fantastic. Great stuff. Should be up any second now. Just take a second. - It's, uh... - Coming up soon, right? Yeah, just... well... What's going on here? Where the hell are you? What the hell are you doing? That's a $500 projector! What the hell is that? What are you, some kind of genital freak? Huh? What is that? Is that what I spent money for? That's my Golden Fig Leaf Award, right, from Anchorage, Alaska? How many of them do you think they give out? You dropped your sunglasses. I'll drop 'em again! Get out of here, you phony! She was different, she really was. She just didn't know what was going on at all. And she really thought she said something. Uh... excuse me, excuse me. Uh, is this... you're casting for that "be black" thing, for the police officer? Be Black Baby, that's right. Well, I'd like to try for it. You don't look much like a cop to me, man. Yeah, you look kinda humble to me. Well... I don't know, man, if you've got pig in you, we'll get it out of you, so why don't you come on in? - Door's over there. - Okay. Hold up. We're gonna have you run through a trial run, you know, to kinda like test your pig potential. I'm willing to do whatever you want. I can do anything, so, you know... Whatever you want to do, I'm willing, 'cause I think I can play a cop. Sure, I know I can. Come on, open that goddamn door! We can't have any perverts here! What'd you say? Huh? What'd you say? What do you mean? That a friend of yours? What are you protesting? Let me see your permit. You don't need a permit? What do you mean? What's that? Against the war in Vietnam? Let me tell you something, son, you ever been in Vietnam? Well, I have, and I know what it's like. Oh, yeah, you know, huh? What are you, two years old, you've been in the Army? You haven't been in the Army in high school. What? What did you say, young lady? "Make love, not war"? Listen, I make love very well. What do you know about love? What do you know about war? Well, you want a good slap in the face, huh? You won't even wear a goddamn brassiere, you little slut. Goddamn bitch. What? What'd you say? What are you gonna do about it? Listen, son, I happen to know that you don't have a permit here, so I'm gonna tell you something... You just touch my bat? You touched my bat? Come on, come out! Gimme it! Come on! Yeah. Listen, people, we want to take you through the black experience, and you all know that being black means being loose. - Being what? - Being black means being loose. And that's part of our history, and what we want to do is kind of loosen you up, to more or less prepare you for the experience that we're about to take you through. Okay, now, feel down the arms to the hands. Slowly. You know. We're gonna not rush anything. Touching the hands. Keep your arms clear. Feel anything? Are you aware of any differences? You know...? - He's got a scar. - A scar! - Carolyn is wearing her ring. - I'm sorry! ...then to the neck, and then to the hair. You feel any differences now? No, not the head. Just feel the hair. - So this is a natural? - Yes, it's very natural. It's very... it's sort of springy, isn't it? Like a sponge. - It's like a sponge. - It's like angel food cake. - Is anyone else...? - I had expected steel wool... ...but it's soft, and... ...to the left, back, right, forward... left, back, right, forward... Okay? How are you doing over there? You're not doing anything! Come on, move! Stop taking notes! You're supposed to dance now. Come on. I have to review this for Eye Magazine. I'm sorry. - You're not touching. Come on. - I don't want to touch. You're supposed to. Just keep going. We're supposed to be... we're supposed to relax, right? This is making me very nervous. I'd rather not touch him. I'd rather relax. It's just a play. Right. You're participating in a play, and this is part of your part. But you're the actors. We're the audience, honey. You're also an actor in this case. We're just not sure of the point of this whole thing. We're trying. - Well, come on, let's just do it. - Right. Okay. Forward, side, back, side... Now, in order to be black and to feel black, you've got to eat black, and we have here for you today, through the kindness of sister Carolyn here, who was kind enough to whip it up for us, some of the best in soul food... black-eyed peas... pig feet, and greens. Collard greens. And here we go, right for you. - Thank you. - You're welcome. That's enough, that's enough. No, that's good. Mr. Paul. No, no, no. No, no, no. - No, no, you have to eat it. - I don't have to eat that, no, no. Don't look at it like that. You're supposed to eat it. Taste it! Why don't you want it? Is something wrong with it? - What's wrong with it? - What's the matter? That's the food we eat. We got to dish out some stuff for the brother up here. He doesn't even have any! I done told you, I don't care for any. - Open your mouth. - I really... No, no. Now, you really must. You really must. Thank you. Okay. That's some beans for you. Now you need some greens. - Wait a minute. - Chew it. Swallow it. - Chew it and say, "Mmm!" - It's good! Go ahead, swallow it, swallow it. Oh, there's something... wait a minute. Oh, yeah, okay, that's all right. Would you eat... hurry up and eat, man? Yeah, I will. You didn't eat none of your meat, man. The sooner you finish, the sooner you get to the show. Right. All of this is what you eat. All of that. That stuff... eat it, man. You know, you're supposed to be so pro-us, then eat us, you understand? There it is, right there. Eat it. - Excuse me. - Eat it, man. - I really... - Well, eat it, man! I mean, this is the black experience. Eat it. Thank you. You all have, uh... you're just about ready for the show. Yeah, you're just about ready. You've tasted black, you've danced black, and you've felt black, and now you've got to be black in order to truly know what it is to have the black experience. Okay, so you come on up here, and we're gonna do you up. - Oh, look! - I'm gonna take care of you. Okay, you look great. Well, you know, you're a bit negroish, so we get to put some on you. Now I can be black on the outside. - Yeah, well, you know. - No, no. - You must. Lady, lady... - It's gonna ruin my makeup! ...it's part of the experience. - Don't. Oh! - Come on! It's all...! - It's all part of it. Close your eyes before you get it in your eyes. Don't get it in my hair. Okay, I won't get it in your hair, your pretty blonde hair. - Don't rub it in. - I won't, I won't. Close your mouth. Oh, this is senseless, just senseless. No, it's not. Yeah. You know, the next thing we do, now that you are black, as white people, we want to kinda get to know you better, 'cause you know all white people want to get to know black people. Is that right? That's right. Now, we want to kinda get to know you better and kinda socialize with you and kinda understand what you're about, black people, see, because we're white and you're black. - We're black now? - That's right. You look black. Look at us. You see? So we want to kinda get into your personal lives, you know, just to be friendly. Oh, I think I have enough. So, why don't we kinda break up and get to know each other, the individual people, okay? Yeah, my name is John Dillinger, you understand. - Hello. - How you doing? - Paul Vymil. - Right. Now, listen, do you have any I.D. On you? Any "idea" on me? No, I.D. Identification. - Yes, in my wallet. - Could I see it for a second? - Where are you from? - I'm from Manhasset. From Manhasset? Yeah, what do you do now? Well, I'm a housewife. A housewife? Do you have any children? No. You don't? You gonna have some soon? Well, we're, uh... we're planning. I mean, we're in a family-planning group. Oh, how exciting. How very, very interesting. Why don't you let me take your purse for you for the rest of the show, because we're going to go on up to a new level, and I'm going to take good care of it downstairs, okay? And you don't want to carry this heavy thing around with you all day. Why don't you just go on upstairs, and we'll be right with you, all right? Yeah, why don't you just go on upstairs now. Well... They didn't take her purse! Lady. Hey, would you like to join us? Come on! Uh, what...? She... she took my purse, and she didn't take her purse, and I would like my purse back. Oh, no, that's silly. - Did they take your purse? - They didn't really? She said they were doing it to everybody, but I'm the only one that it happened to, and I don't like that. It's downstairs. It's downstairs, okay? - Well, l... - I think l... She took it. She took my... she said every... she took everyb... she said everybody was doing it. Why don't you go down and find it for her? Why don't you go down with her? I think she's a little bit upset. Joe, I think you should go down. Well, I think somebody oughtta go get it. I don't want to go down. - Well, listen, it's just part of the play. - It's not funny! Well, it's just part of the play, that's all. I looked in my wallet, all of my money is gone. - Joe, go down. - I'm sure it's part of the play, but... It is. It's just part of the play. - Go down. - It's not funny. No, I don't want you to walk down with me. - We'll go together. Come on. - Well, you should go. Speak to the director. I'm sure you'll get it back. I'm going right behind you, Joe. Just stay there. Stay with the girl. Stay here. Stay and talk to her. All right? I'm perfectly capable of going down by myself. If anything happens, come right back... if anything happens. I-I'm sure it's just part of the play. Don't worry about it. Joe, don't get hostile. Be nice. I won't get hostile. There's... there's a number of people. They're just kidding around. You can hear them laughing. Um... excuse me. - Excuse me. - Right. Hi. Would you like to come in for a second, man? Sure. Sure. Wait a second! Somebody do something, will you? - It's part of the play! - It's not part of the play! Somebody do something! Listen, they didn't really hurt him. I still haven't got my money, she hasn't got her bag. - It's no joke, huh? - It's just part of the performance. Oh, some performance. Where's his money? I don't know what to do. Listen, this happens every performance. - Oh, we'll get it later, then. - All right. Come on, let's go up to the next stage. Come on. I'm not gonna go in there, that's for sure. - Well, that's, you know... - All right. Where's the theat...? Well, where's he gonna be? Well, he'll meet you after the performance. Hey, lady! You. You, come up here. I'm talking to you. I said get up here. Go ahead. Yeah, the one with the stupid look on her face. Yeah, in the green coat. You, Miss Blondie. Get up here. - I'd like my purse back. - She's not a blonde! She's a nigger with blonde hair. Get the fuck up here, lady. Get up here, now! You hear? - What the hell is going on here? - Shut up, mister. - Hey, take it easy. - Are you kidding or something? I don't want you to talk to me like that. I didn't ask you nothing. I said get up here. Now, I want all of you up here now, 'cause we're gonna go through something that you been waiting for, niggers. I'd like to go to the theater. Yeah, I think you want to go. Now, get up here! All of you, get up here! Okay, mother fuckers, move! Now! Oh, my God, I think he's got a gun! That's right, it's a gun and it kills. Now, move! Come on, fatso, move!

Come on, you're a nigger. Now, what's your real name? - What's your real name? - That's my real name. That's my real name, I'm telling ya! I'm not kidding you, officer, I mean it. They got my wallet and my papers. What's his real name? How does he know? He doesn't even know me! Freeman! Martin Freeman! I know him! My name is Zinn, Murray Zinn. Prime Minister of the Black Panthers! I know him. He tried to bomb my house! - Where do you live, Martin? - I live up in Scarsdale. Scarsdale?! What do you mean Scarsdale?! Come on, Martin, what's this, huh? Avon... Avon Street! Avon Street! Come on, Martin, where do you live? - I live on Avon Street in Scarsdale. - Goddamn nigger! What? He lives on 147th Street.

Good audience, good audience! Very good! Gotta hand it to them. - Outta sight, now. - Glad you enjoyed the show. - Was that in good taste? - Yeah. Well, Clive... Clive Barnes was really right. That was some experience! It was a great, great show. Great theater. I'm gonna tell all my friends they've got to come. They've all really got to come. Except they should have called it... It was really something. ... Humiliate the Honky or Hump the Honky, but it was great theater. How about you, sir? It was magnificent, a magnificent experience. I'm tickled I came. It made you feel what it felt like to be a Negro. I mean, it really gave you the... to be black. It really makes you stop and think, really. Certainly I've worried about the problems, the... the... oh, the... you could almost say the sicknesses in our society. But it was invigorating. It was... I-I find it hard to think! Listen to that stupid shit! Oh, man, fuck them, you know. Kick their behinds, and they still go for it. I don't think they learned a thing. We have to go to those projects up there with the silent middle class, in those projects, where they're sitting with their pipes right now, in their chairs, reading the New York Times... you have to go up there, and you have to blow their minds. Just do it, man! Go in there and blow the fuck out of 'em! ...table of contents, table of contents... Ah, contents. "Introduction, 13. "One, Collective Behavior. Two, the Countryside vs. The City.

Thank you for your generous contributions. And now, stay tuned for N.I.T. Journal, The Black Revolution, Part 4: Search and Destroy, coming up next. Hi, my name is Harry Jameson. I work for MetLife. Yes, pleased to meet you. Are you a member of the club? "The urban guerrilla must become and remain anonymous..." Okay, Joyce, go in through the playground. - Right. - Hurry up. Okay, man, head for the lobby of the west building. Stay low. Move fast. Okay, listen, we've got to go straight across the plaza. Be very cool. Let's go. When we hit the pillars, let's move. Come on. - Hi, Jessica, how are you? - Fine, and you? I'm okay... You stay back. Where are you from? Do you have permission to do this? Excuse me. Shit! Try that one! Get back. Would you like to buy some shares in black today? Really, you could at least be careful. This elevator's much too crowded. Do you know what it's like to be a black man in America today, Mr. James M. Russick? Sick. S-l-C-K. Come on, pig, open this goddamn door! Okay, this is your last chance. Hey, what is this? Be black, baby! I want to take my bike out. Oh. Now stay tuned for N.I. T.'s award-winning program, Homegrown Happening. - Honey? - Yeah? What do you want for dinner? What do I want for dinner? Mmm. Thank you. Here. - Whatever you'd like. - We've got turkey... ...beef, or fried chicken, and I have a Mexican one in the freezer. Well, I've been making enough decisions this week, and I think you can make that one. Okay, Mr. Decision-Maker. Come on, Daisy. Come, let's have din-din. - Come on, sweetie. - She's all right, honey. Leave her. - Honey! - Yeah? You know what I read in TV Guide today? No, what did you read in TV Guide today? - They cancelled Peyton Place. - Oh, that's too bad. I can't believe it! I'm so depressed about it. I mean, you know, I've been watching that show four or five years. I feel as if I know those people. They're like my friends and neighbors. Must be a blow to those actors when they lose a series like that. I hear that after a few years, three or four or something, you become a millionaire. I'd like to go out there and sell a few policies to them, huh? How'd you like to go to Hollywood, hmm? Sell some of the actors some policies? Met has great offices in Los Angeles. That reminds me, the other day I sold a policy to Harry Jameson. He's kind of a friend of mine, and he told my supervisor, Joe McMann, he told Joe about my style and how well I sold the policy, and he said that Joe seemed a little nervous, as if I was doing too well, you know. Thought maybe I was bucking for his position. - I think he was right. - He's jealous! You keep up the good work, honey. You keep it up. You're a real plugger. Oh, honey! Yeah? Did you think about what I asked you? - What's that? - About the dishwasher. Oh, yeah, I did think about that. I was just selling a policy to someone out on Staten Island, and he had a beautiful washer for $90, and he sort of implied that if I didn't buy the washer, he wouldn't take the policy, he'd buy it from Prudential. Oh, honey, I don't want a secondhand washer. I don't want something everybody else has put their dirty old dishes in. Well, I wouldn't worry about it. It's a very good one, and we can't afford to get anything better at this point. I mean, it's better than buying one for $300 or $400. We have too many payments. We have the car payments, we have this rug that you bought. What color is it? Did you ever think of that? - My kitchen happens to be yellow. - It's white. White?! I don't want a white dishwasher! Everybody has 'em! Oh, come on, honey, I want it to match the kitchen. So what color do you want? I want yellow. Oh, now, listen, we can get a yellow one in a few years. Oh, honey, you just never think about those things. You don't know anything about kitchens. - Don't worry, it'll work out... - Honey! What's the matter? Are you all right? I feel something. Are you okay? It's too much for me. I just can't take it. - Just take it easy. Don't worry. - I just can't take all this housework... ...and all the cooking and all the laundry and everything. It's just too much for me. - Okay. Don't worry. - I'm just exhausted! - Look, look. Okay... - I can't handle it. All right, all right. Now, look, from now on, from now on, I'm gonna do everything. I'm gonna call the agency right away. We're gonna get some colored help. It's very cheap. We can afford it. I'm gonna borrow on the policy. Nothing is more important than our child, do you understand? Oh, honey. - Nothing. Don't worry... - What about me? Oh, he really kicked, honey. Did he really? Yeah? Let me listen. Don't press so! I'm not pressing. It's my child, honey. I can't hear anything, though. Can't hear anything? Well, stop pressing so hard! You're gonna kill the kid! You almost gave me a miscarriage, carrying me over here! Okay, okay. Take it easy, honey. You're very excited now. You're very excitable. I'm gonna call the doctor right now. I'm gonna do all the work. You're not gonna do anything. I'm gonna work until we get a maid, okay? Now, just take it easy. I'm gonna take the laundry out now, okay? Now, take it easy. All right, I'll be right back. And now, from our studios in New York, the Now News with John Winnicove. This is John Winnicove with the evening report. This afternoon, I stood on the former site of the Community Co-op. As you know, the building was completely leveled by an explosion last Friday night. Over the past few days, the police and special agents of the FBI have discovered that the explosion emanated from the laundry room, and are even now sifting through the rubble in an effort to determine the cause or causes or person or persons responsible for this truly horrible holocaust. This afternoon we were on the scene, speaking with relatives of former tenants and friends, and we switch to that report now. Avery Gunnz. I-I don't live in the building, but I was on my way... I-I was visiting my sister last night, and I left my wallet there, and I'm really upset. I had my driver's license and my credit cards, and I don't know what to do. It's a terrible thing. - You think it's a good thing, sir? - Yes, I think it's a good thing. I think a lot of people have dogs in this neighborhood. I think we'll be able to walk our dogs now. I think we need more room like this. Well, now, you weren't a resident here, obviously. No, I'm not a resident, but we need more... A lot of these things are going to be happening. They're doing quite a bit of this, and I think they'll be blowing them up faster than they can build 'em. I live in that red house across the street, and I can see from my window. I can see all the entries that were here. Strange people always walking in and out, all hours of the night and day. All the time. I see. So you attribute it to someone who's just walking in and out. - Some funny person did this. - Funny person. I see. - Sir, did you have an opinion? - Yes. - What is your name? - Joe. Dr. Joe King. - Dr. King, you say? - Yeah. Right. - A doctor of medicine? - I'm a psychiatrist, yeah. Would you like to turn right to the camera here so we could face the camera? Now, Dr. King, what are your feelings about this? Well, you know, it probably is the result of somebody who cracked under the pressures of our society. You know, we have such intense materialistic pressures, and there's such a tremendous gap between those who make it and those who don't. And you feel most definitely that that frustration is the kind of thing that is taken out here. It's the kind of thing... We're raised on violence in America, you know? People are... all these toy guns, and the war in Vietnam... - Excuse me, sir. - Excuse me, what is your name? My name is Jon Rubin, sir, and I just came back from Vietnam. I spent 18 months over there, and I'd just like to say that... What were you doing over there? Would you mind telling us what...? I happen to be a demolition expert. You might be able to give us some clue. We've been trying to determine the... As a matter of fact, I was noticing this building, getting away from that, and it looks like a pretty good job. Uh, you know, I hate to say it, but it looks like it was done by an expert, at least. I'd just like to say, sir, I'm just sick of this... - Well, please, we're on the air. - Sorry, sir, that's the way I feel. I'm just kinda annoyed about the fact that, well, I just come back from Vietnam after we kinda, you know, sweep up the country there. We've got 500,000 men over there, and then we come back to this country, and what do we see? We see some kind of mess on the floor, and people killed... I mean, a fellow like this has never seen any... You haven't seen any action. You ever been in the Army? You ever been over in Korea or Vietnam or in the Second War? You haven't seen what I've seen. I've seen arms shot off. I've seen faces blown up. - I've seen... taken off. - Hey. I'm sick of all that... I'm sick of all that... Excuse me, please, we have to... I'm sorry. We have to... I-I don't mean to push you, but we have to get off the air now. Do you have anything you might just like to say in summary? Well, I would like to say something, if you don't mind. No, of course not. I'd like to say hello to my mother, if you don't mind. Uh... of course. Thank you. Hi, Ma!
