Jatiwalu. Mahesa. Take anything you want... but don't touch what is mine. Attack! Suci, hide! Mongrel! Ranaweleng. Long time no see. Rana! Suci. At last, we meet again. Rana! Rana... Rana... Rana! Mom. Run! Dad. Kalingundil. Take that kid. Run, Wiro! Run! Wiro! Come here. Don't! Let me go! Wiro! Whore! Go to Hell with the rest of your family! Burn that goddamn child! No one recalls the time when Silat was born in this world. Some believe it was born from the will of the gods. Some believe it is born from human revelations. Some are convinced it comes from Suwarnadwipa. Some are assured it originated from Yavadwipa. Gran. What? This is so heavy! Don't be weak, come on! For some people, Silat is a dhukka, a sorrow. And for others, a dharma, a blessing. Do it properly, Wiro! Humans never stop fighting about who is right, and who deserves more to master it. Sooner or later, those who learn Silat will have to make a choice. Which path will they take? Light... or dark? Here's your coffee. Thank you, Gran. After all, the ones who call themselves Light or Dark... are still subject to fame, money, and power. Excuse me, my apologies, priest. This is my spot. Would you mind moving a little bit? No! Come on, sir! The story is not finished yet. Hey, get going now! Before my customers disappear. Stingy! You think your dad pays for my rent? Go home. Have a safe journey. Watch your armpit! That is sharp, Gran. Come on, Wiro, show me all you've got. Are you trying to kill me with your Sun Ray Strike? Is that a new toy? So cool! Forgive me, master. I chose you to become my pupil. But will it choose you, too? Catch! I got you now. Why is this so hard? Is he dead? Wiro? Wiro! Wiro... Wiro? Are you looking for this, Gran? You were worried about me, huh? Seventeen years Have passed. Gran? The elder is getting closer To becoming ashes. Seventeen years guiding The infant To might. Come here, Wiro. Ro... Are you deaf? Come here. I am not deaf. What is this, Gran? I'm a grown-up. I can change my own clothes. You old flirt. You've just grown up and you're already being cocky. Just tell me if you want to buy me new clothes. Why does it have to be all white? I look like a corpse. So you will always remember to have a clean heart. It's hard to keep it clean. So, if my clothes are dirty, that means my heart is dirty, too? So weird. What about this? Here. What does it mean? It won't come off. It's a symbol. A reminder for you. The knowledge we have learned is 212. What does it mean? Where did you come from? From Mt. Gede, Gran. I was asking where you came from, not where you lived. I'd rather go back to sleep. Answer me! - From my father and mother. - Where did they come from? - Grandfather and Grandmother. - Where did they come from? - Great-grandfather and great-grandmother. - Where did they come from? - From my great ancestors. - Where did your great ancestors come from? - From my great-great ancestors. - Where did they come from? You laugh, but you don't get it, do you? Nope. Stupid! I will become stupid if you keep beating me. In this life, Wiro... there are always two elements that are opposite... yet are a pair. But all of them come from The One. The Almighty... 212. This Fire Dragon Axe has chosen you as its heir. Use this Fire Dragon Axe and Black Stone. Where's the stone? Wait, I forgot. You forgot? You senile... Look at this. Take this, Wiro. Only use this Fire Dragon Axe and Black Stone in a life and death situation. Otherwise, keep it sheathed. Thank you, Gran. From this moment on... you will be known as Fire Dragon Axe 212 Warrior. Wiro Sableng, Crazy Wiro. That means you are ready to fulfill your duty. What kind of duty, Gran? Listen carefully and remember this. Forty years ago... I adopted a boy, just like you. An orphan. Robbers killed his family. I was planning my retreat... Watch out! ...because I was fed up with all the bloodshed. I was hoping that the boy would become the heir to the Fire Dragon Axe. But sometimes, high hopes don't always turn out the way we want. One night... What are you doing, Suranyali? I only want to take what is mine! Green Centipede Fist! You insolent pupil! Forgive me, master! Don't you dare call me "master" anymore. You have disgraced the 212 teachings. He became more evil. Suranyali now calls himself Mahesa Birawa. Mahesa Birawa was last seen in Jatiwalu. Find him. I have passed down all that I know to you, Wiro. Now it's time for you to enter the real world. To make your own path. Seventeen years ago... when your little hands squeezed my hand tight... I felt a warmth that I have never felt before. Gran. You have changed my life, Wiro... which was once a bitter... and lonely existence. I owe my life to you, Gran. You are the only family I have. I will bring Mahesa Birawa. As long as the sky is still blue, the forest is still green... and the river still flows to the ocean... we'll see each other again... Crazy Wiro. Your Majesty. We heard that there has been suspicious movement in Kalijaga. Suspicious movement? What about Princess Rara Murni and the prince? Any news from them? They have reached Jatiwalu. About a three-day journey from Kalijaga, Your Majesty. Forgive me, My King. From the very start, I have shown my concern about our sister's plan to bring the prince along on that journey. The current situation is not good. Her intentions are good. She wants the prince to learn... and to see how things are with his own eyes. Forgive me, my King. But, for their own safety... please allow me to send General Kalasrenggi to take them home. Go ahead! Magic... axe! Magic... axe! Magic... axe! Hey, young man! That's the Fire Dragon Axe. How are you affiliated with Screwy Sinto? Who are you? I am the Drunken God, and this is my disciple, Anggini. So, you know my master? Really? You are Sinto's disciple? What's your name, son? I'm Crazy Wiro. The master is screwy and the disciple is crazy. Hey, Crazy Wiro, marry my disciple! You will be a good warrior couple. Master, what the hell? Just obey your master. Excuse me. She's not my type. Who said that I'm into you? Are you deaf? That's your master talking. It's the wine talking. It's the same. You two get along well already. Get along how, exactly? Never mind, I've got things to do. I am leaving now, Drunken God. - Syahrini. - Anggini! Yeah, whatever. Wait, where are you going? I am looking for Mahesa Birawa. Mahesa Birawa. The person you are going to face is not an ordinary enemy. Are you sure you can deal with him alone? Take my disciple to help you. I can handle him myself. Excuse me, Drunken God. Hurry, follow him! He doesn't want any help. What did I do to deserve a stupid disciple like you? You want to be a warrior, don't you? For your final test, help him to deal with Mahesa Birawa! Go, hurry! Seriously? If I pass this test, I will become a warrior? - Yes. - And I can walk my own path? Yes, you will pass if you survive. Hurry up! Yes, master! Hey! Anggini! Don't forget to steal his heart and marry him! Don't let yourself become an old lonely spinster. Like me. What would you like to eat? Anything. As long as it's good... and cheap. Huh? Yam? You wanted something cheap? Yam it is! Just eat. So small... Run! Jackass. Bring me your best food. Yes. Kalingundil. Four bearded men. The group will arrive soon. They're undercover. How many guards? Five, more or less. More or less? - If there's more? - Six. - If there's less? - Four. Stop joking around! Remember... Mahesa Birawa himself will cut your damn throats if you fail. My fellow warriors... the kingdom is in a weak state, and will soon plunge itself to the brink of destruction. The old ways must be eradicated. And it is up to us to bring about change. We are taking over the kingdom! Of course. And we will succeed. Succeed? Tell us about your plan. I don't want to be slaughtered for nothing. Are you doubting me? The question is... can I trust all of you here? Soldiers are no strangers to loyal oaths. While a lot of you... A traitor is talking about oaths? Watch your mouth! Stop! Competition season is not here yet. I have chosen General Kalasrenggi to plan the attack. Those who are against this will answer to me. What is it, Uncle? Is there a problem? Something is not right. Seize the prince! Don't be so mesmerized. - Hey, bald guy. - Die, you crazy monkey! Mongrel. Uncle! Ugh, who the hell are you, crazy monkey? I am Crazy Wiro! - Go after them! - Go! Go! Where is it? It's gone? What? Let me see it again. Where is your weapon? Hey. Going so soon? Mind your own business. I don't have business with bearded men like you. I just want to know where's Mahesa Birawa. Any idea? It's ripped. This is new! Bald guy! Bald guy! Where is the bald guy? I don't know, but the bearded man went that way. Chasing the girl. Tell me, why were you chasing that pretty girl? Or I'll drop you. Forgive me. Excuse me. - I'll drop you! - If you want that girl... Excuse me. Let me go! - Excuse me! - Holy shit. My friend, sorry to disturb you. I thought you weren't human. You scared me, man. Who are you? My name is Wiro. I have business with the bearded guy. That guy. That guy. Bearded? Ah, so you're into bearded men, huh? Oh, my. Here. My name is Santiko, known as the Mad Mighty Fist. - Surely you have heard of me? - Nope. - What? Never? - Never. Boy, where have you been all this time? Living on a mountain? How did you know? - So I was right? - Yes. Oh, my God. That explains it. You mountain man! You have no social life. Then neither do you. Look at yourself! Look at that! Fat belly, clothes on backwards, and sitting on a tree. Like an orangutan. Orangutan! If you want this hairball, come and get it yourself. Why don't you come down here? - You climb up here. - You come down. - Up. - Down. Come up here if you dare, you mountain man! Is that a challenge? Let's fight. No touching! - I can get up myself. - So cocky. I'm behind you. Don't joke around! Oh, no. Don't. Go away. Watch out. Stop joking around! Stop joking! How dare you pull my hair? I don't care. What are you doing here? Are you his girl? Stop talking, Mahesa Birawa! Who is Mahesa Birawa? Help! Help. Hey! Stop pulling my pants! Let go! My underwear! Aunty! Must be my lucky day! Aunty! Aunty... Your head is worth at least three bags of gold. Three bags of gold! I smell failure. We killed hundreds of guards. - But... - What? You failed, didn't you? Why don't you try it yourself? Traitor! Enough! What happened? Mahesa... We managed to corner them... but suddenly, this monkey warrior appeared... with his dragon axe! Did he mention his name? He calls himself... Crazy Wiro. Do you know him? Crazy... Screwy... Thank God. My dream came true. Don't mess with me! Don't touch me. No, I'm an ally. I'm an ally. Who are you guys? Who are you? - Calm down. - Where is the prince? - Prince! - I can be your prince. Prince! The prince? Who are you? I'm Rara Murni, King Kamandaka's sister. Greetings, Your Highness, I am Anggini. I'm Santiko. The Mad Mighty Fist. I am an ally, not a threat. Where are we? Crazy? Crazy! What's that smell? What is that? Goddess... We have been waiting for you. Really? It is written... "When darkness devours light... and the night sky turns blood red... he who laughs at the world will be born." Really? Who is it? It's you, Wiro! The world is in chaos. The dark side is getting out of control. But first, let's get to know each other more. May I know your name? Why are you so beautiful? My name is not important now. They are more important. Horrible bloodshed will happen in this country. You must stop them! Of all the warriors in this country... why must I be bothered? Just so you know... the leader of the dark warriors is Mahesa Birawa. Mahesa Birawa? Remember, you must act quickly. You don't have much time! Like a goddess who moves like the eastern wind... Crazy Wiro! Why... Why are you following me around? Look, she's gone. Wiro, the prince is missing. We must help him. "We"? What do you mean? Do it yourself. Don't involve me. Warrior Wiro. Please help us. My nephew is in danger. I have to save him. Oh, no! Who could say no to this sweet thing? Plus, she's wet. What do you mean? All right, I'll help you. I have an idea. We must get out of here at once! Everybody knows we need to get out of here. Princess, let's climb this cliff. I'll help you. Wait, beautiful, wait for me. I'll go first. What? Where have you been, Crazy? You smell like a fresh graveyard. You talk too much, Mad Mighty Elephant! Fist! Mad Mighty Fist! You smell like a boar, now move. Wait, Crazy. Wait! Not so fast! - Rara... - Crazy, wait for me. Hey, Soul Pulling Devil! Find them. - Warrior Wiro. - Yes? Thank you for saving us. The kingdom owes you a great deal. No need to thank me. Everybody would jump at a chance to protect a beautiful lady with a noble heart like you. Rara... If I may know... why did you and the prince travel in disguise? It's dangerous. Actually, I only wanted my nephew to see the true condition of the nation he is going to rule in the future. Without make-up. If we came on an official kingdom visit, golden chariot and all, usually the local officials would hide all of the negative sides. If we went in disguise, we would be able to see the reality. Populist. What? Huh? Why? What? What did you say? What did I say? Just now. Nothing. I just want my nephew to be a king who defends the prosperity of his people. But my plan has put him in danger now. It seems like fate has brought us together, Wiro. The person I'm looking for... is also the one behind all this. I think... we are meant to be together. Hey, I think I know where the prince is. Yes. Over there. Crazy, where are you going? Please help me first. Whatever. - I'm stuck. - Don't care! - Wait. - Whatever. Mahesa, I've found the Prince. Green Kala! How can I stay quiet? This letter clearly states that they want me to bring the ransom myself. I understand your feelings, my King. If you do not obey them... the prince and princess' lives will be in danger. If I may suggest, you should do this mission in disguise. You think I am afraid of them, that I need to go in disguise? It is not my intention to speak rudely, my King. I mean, the purpose of your trip needs to be a secret. We can announce that you are going deer hunting to avoid suspicion from our people. Careful. It's dangerous. Stop it! Annoying. Why? Never eaten a snake before? No? It's different. Whose fart is that? Boar! Show yourself! - Show yourself! - Funny? Enough! You again! - Aunty! - Not dead yet? Give us the prince or prepare to die! I have more allies. You guys are dead meat! What gang are you with, exactly? So cocky. Are you from the Stinky Hairy Gang? No wonder your hair is all over the place. You mongrels! - Your fart is poisonous. - He's dead! Mommy. Mommy! I won't be naughty. I promise. I promise. Prince. Hey, Prince! - Mom. - Wiro. Goddess, you came back. So cute. Anggini, what is going on? Fried chicken. So big. Like a perfume. Skull Valley Clan! This cheap black magic only works on men. Wiro. Master Sinto. Wake up, Wiro. You've been hypnotized by a soul-pulling song. Wiro, there's four of them. - Five. - Oh, yes, this should be fun! She is beautiful. What a flirty boy. Are you talking to yourself? Where's the bearded man? Bearded? Still unconscious. Tell the serpent to get ready. Right away, sir. Do not fail this. Aunty! The rebellion has just begun. Looks like you. Like me? Princess, you mentioned that your journey was actually classified. That means... It means... They are planning for a coup. But... Why did they attack the prince? - He's just a prince, not the king. - Quite stupid. Does your father love you, Prince? Of course he does! He is probably looking for me now. Looking for you? Yes. Why? Snake. Snake? Yeah. It's just like a snake. If you grab its head, the tail will lash you. But if you grab the tail... Its head will attack! The king! Yes? Take us to Mahesa Birawa now! No! All right, all right. All hail the king. Come on. What road is this? Welcome, King Kamandaka! What an honor. The king himself visits my humble abode. Cut the crap. I've brought five crates of gold. Now, release my son and my sister! Hurry! The old order ends today. We are the new force of this country... who will bring it to its former glory! You traitor! Protect the king. Attack! Defense! Farewell, despicable King. Mahesa Birawa. My name is Crazy Wiro. Master Sinto sent me to bring you back to Mt. Gede. Now, pack your things! I don't have much time. Die, Mahesa Birawa! Mahesa is my business. He's also my test! Help Rara now! Such fighting spirit you have! What did the old bat promise you? Seventeen years ago... Granny Sinto saved my life in Jatiwalu. I will take you back to Mt. Gede... or you'll die here. Seventeen years ago... Jatiwalu. Don't tell me you are the bastard child of Suci and that headman? You know, your parents were nothing but trash. Your father did nothing when I harassed your mother. You miss your parents? I'll send you to Hell to see them! Where's your great and magical 212 Axe? Where is it? Rara! Father! Father! Retreat! Kamandaka! Let's go. The kingdom has been taken over. Come. Rest now, Wiro. I've cleansed the poison, but you're not fully recovered. I have failed. What do you mean? My master said that... if I could defeat Mahesa Birawa... I would become a true warrior. So, I went after him. It's not your fault. We, the warriors... always think that we are different. But we are only human. Unable to determine our fate. Rebels. Rebels! Run! Rebels! Crazy child! Gran. Master. Wiro. Why didn't you tell me... that Mahesa Birawa was the one who killed my parents? There is no end to revenge, Wiro. Once you are trapped in revenge... it will drag you down and swallow you whole, and your life will be consumed by darkness. Just like Mahesa Birawa. So, what do I have to do, master? I don't deserve to be your disciple. Gran. There is something bigger than your vengeance. One thing that even exceeds Heaven and Earth and all things in between. All the things I have taught you are a path... that will lead you to perfection. Become one, Wiro. Hey, wake up! Hurry. King Kamandaka summoned us! We can go to a safe house in the north forest. And make a plan while we're there. Will do, Your Majesty. This is the house. Werku Alit! - Who the hell is Werku Alit? - All the pain and sorrow that befell us... I never thought that my own brother was behind all of this. Oh, his brother. He is evil. We must take control of the palace immediately. But this attack must be done secretly. We have a chance through the east wall. This high wall lacks guards. But who's able to pass these high walls? Let me do this, Your Majesty. Werku Alit must be celebrating. I need someone in disguise to sneak in. Focus all of this attack on one point... My throne! Halt! What's inside? - Good evening. - Good evening. Why don't you show your face? I'm shy. Excuse her. She got beriberi once. We must save the empress. Do you hear me? Hey! Hey! Rotten boar! Attack! Run! Master! Be careful! You be careful. You go there, I'll stay here. Your Highness, King Kamandaka sent me to rescue you. Come with me. Your Majesty. Mom! My son! - Are you okay? - I'm fine. Take them to a safe place. Use my sword to protect your mother and your people. Will do, Father. Warrior Wiro. Let's find Werku Alit. Looking for someone? What's that? Hey, what are you doing? Hey! Are we going to fight? Let's fight. What's taking you so long? Leave him to me. Warrior Wiro, go finish your business with Mahesa Birawa. You're not dead yet, bastard? Why? Are you worried? Werku Alit. Our fight is yet to come. Kalingundil, take care of that douchebag. Forgive me. Forgive me, brother. Forgive me. Rara Murni is dead because of you. Dharma. Become one. Wiro, now! Warriors. Yoo-hoo! I will miss you guys. Me, too. I guess I'm going that way. I'm going that way. And I'm going that way. Thank you, my friends. Until we meet again, my friends. See you! This time, we failed. Don't be reckless, Anom! You must master the Evil Testament Book. I will, master.
