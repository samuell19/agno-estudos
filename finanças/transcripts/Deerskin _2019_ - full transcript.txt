The film you are about to see was born under a good star. I promise to never again wear a jacket for the rest of my life. I promise to never again wear a jacket for the rest of my life. I promise to never again wear a jacket... - You know. - For the rest of my life. Now close the trunk. And if you didn't exist Tell me why I should exist To hang around in a world without you Without hope and without regrets And if you didn't exist I'd try to invent love As a painter who sees by his hand The birth of daylight colors And can't get over it. And if you didn't exist Tell me who I'd exist for Passers-by asleep in my arms Who I could never love Yes, what? I called yesterday about the ad. - Ah, George? - That's right. - It's very hot, be careful. - Thank you. - Do you take sugar? - No. Thank you. I suppose you'd like to see it right away? If you don't mind. I'm super excited. I understand. Don't move. No... Ah, here we are! I have it! Here's the beast. 100% deerskin. Holy fuck. And... Not a single fringe is missing! May I see the other side? Fuck. I wore it for about a year. Then the fashion changed, so I put it away. One of a kind, you know! It even had a label. Made in Italy I took it out because it was scratchy. 6300... 6500... 6700... 6900... 7100... 7300... 7500... Fucking hell, I've never seen so much dough my whole life. I'm short 200. It's all I could withdraw. That's OK. You know what? I'll even toss in something extra. Not only have you just acquired the jacket of your dreams, but as a bonus, you get this digital camcorder. Almost new. Tested recently... It works like factory new. - Digital? - Digital is top of the line! Yeah. Look at you. What a look! So, how many nights? Six, seven? - One month. - One month? Yes, at least. What? You'll be here a month? Yes, I want to be alone. You'll be alone. So... I'll give you Room 15. It's a fox paw. How would you like to pay? Uh... yes then, for that, I have a small issue with my bank card. But that should be settled by tomorrow, usually. Therefore... - How do we do this? - You can't stay here free, sir. I know, but can it wait until tomorrow, I mean? If you leave me a valuable object, then yes, you can pay whenever you want. Otherwise, I can't help. I have this. It's gold. - Not good enough? - Yes, this will be fine. Thank you. - The room is on the second floor. - Yes, thank you. Killer. Sick style. Yes, it's me. Why are you calling me? What's the point? To say that I'm far away... That I'm gone... This is it. Don't you want to know where I am? No. You're nowhere, George. You no longer exist. Here you go. - Whisky. - Thank you. To your health. Cheers. Yes, he said that. But... - He'd done it before, last year? - Yes. I heard from Martine. - Martine? - Yeah. I wanted to tell you but... I didn't know if you'd want to know or... You're talking about my jacket? You're talking about my jacket, right? Uh no. No no. OK. Sorry. Why would we be? It's just that people often bring it up to me. Sometimes... People stop me on the street. I'm used to it. It attracts attention. Sorry. Ah really? They stop you then say what? Well... You can see it's no ordinary garment. Not from around here, are you? I just got here. He may not appreciate our informality. That's alright. It's cool. So what do you you do in life, besides showing off your deerskin? May we ask? Right now I'm... I'm at the bar. Drinking a drink. I, uh... I mean, as a profession, what do you do? I... - You don't want to say? - Yes, of course. I am a filmmaker. Ah! And, you're shooting here? Yes, possibly. Yeah, that's downright possible. It's cool. Hey, Spielberg! Can I drop you somewhere? No, that's nice. I like to walk. If you're looking for sluts for your pornos, I'm totally available. I made a few movies, 20 years ago. I'm still good, eh? But I don't make pornos! What made you think that? You don't seem the real cinema type. Of course I'm in real cinema. Did you take a good look? Didn't notice my sick style? - Alright, OK. - Yeah? - Now you understand? - Let's drop it. Poor fool! - Go away! - OK, bye. "Not the real cinema type." Hey you. Where are you from? I'm from... I'm from Italy. I'm from Italy, I... I'm from Italy. I'm from Italy. That's good. Italy. You're super classy, eh? You look great on camera. And you who are you? I'm your new owner. I think we'll make a good team. Do you want to team up? But I'll be in charge. OK. Good night. What is this shit? Was that you? Well no. No no. Nothing better to do, than to stare at me? Get lost. What are you doing in the area? I left home. Uh... Rather early. I drove in my car and... and then I got here. OK. You withdrew 7550 euros yesterday? Yes. Yes, yesterday. And I need more. The account was blocked this morning. I won't be able to do much. Blocked, what? By you? No, by the person you share this account with. Ah yes. Since when can women block their husband's account? Well, she is your wife. Yes, but, I need 500. I need 500 this week. At least give me 500, it isn't a ridiculous request. The account is blocked, I'm sorry. Shit! Don't worry. I'll find some money. I'll manage. - On the house. - Thanks. Your girlfriend followed me last night. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. I think she wanted to wind up the evening with me. She does that with all the customers. It's her job. Yeah? What is this job? Follower? Are you kidding me? No. Well, a hooker. Ah yes. She's not really a girlfriend. She hangs around here, that's all. But I like her well enough. So tell me, then. Your shoot, what is it? It's not easy to explain, actually. You're here with a crew? Sorry, I'm being familiar... That's alright. No, I'm alone. I'm alone... I'm all alone for the filming part. But let's say there's a crew doing other things. - OK. - Yeah. A fairly big team. - Cool. - Cool, yeah. I know a bit about it. - Yeah? - Yeah because I do editing. I'm waitressing because I have nothing else to do in town. But my passion is editing. Editing, yeah. I enjoy editing movies that already exist. I can change the story. It's cool. I once put Pulp Fiction back in order. - You know, Pulp Fiction... - Yes. Yes. The concept of the film is that it's all out of order. That's what was interesting. So, just to see, I put it back in order. In the end, it plain sucked. It wasn't any good. How do you put a film in order? Do you have a special machine? No... I have a computer. Like anyone else. And the special machine, that's my brain. - OK, yeah. - But, you know... This is all a hobby. I'd love to do it as a real job. That's for sure. These are great jobs. - Yeah. - That's for sure, yeah. I don't realize it anymore because I'm in it... - When I think I get paid for this... - Yeah. It really is crazy. Why did you bullshit that stupid waitress? Some kind of pick up technique? Going to try to bang her? But no! She bought me a drink. I had to be nice. And it wasn't bullshit. You see me use a camera. Using a camera is like making a movie. I'm not so sure. It is! Denise the waitress editor George. George. George. I'm reading. What is it? Want to hear my cherished dream? We can talk later. I'm really into this book. I want to talk about it now. It's important. Close that book. I'm listening. Want to hear my cherished dream, George? Yes, tell me. My cherished dream, George... Is to be... The only jacket in the world. The only one? Yes. The only jacket in the world. I want us to be able to walk in the streets without coming across any other jackets. That's nice because... My cherished dream is... To be the only one in the world wearing a jacket. How do you plan on making this dream happen, George? - Hey! - Hello. - I'm in Room 15. - OK. And I got your message. But it's still a mess with my bank. They've had computer problems for two days. I can't withdraw money. My card is blocked. So uh... What do we do? You can leave us a valuable object. Yes, I did this already. It's done. I left my wedding ring with your employee. Is he here? Working today? He committed suicide. - Huh? - The day before yesterday. Right here. With a hunting rifle. There were brains everywhere. Disgusting. I cleaned everything up myself. It's sad, but hey, he had no family, so it's fine. But then, what do we do? Because it's... We put the body in Room 1 until the undertaker comes to get it. - If you want to say goodbye. - Yes. The door is open. Room 1, yeah. 100% DEERSKIN Oh fuck! Bingo. There! Gross. Ah! It's gold. That'll do. I'll pay you tomorrow. So listen, I won't beat around the bush, uhh... I got my producers on the phone. It wasn't easy because they're currently in Siberia. I don't know if you know, but it's a mess over there, the network there is useless. I had to call back five times. It kept disconnecting. In addition, they were... in the middle of shooting a big fight scene on a glacier, so really not easy. All this to say that I might have good news for you. OK. But what are you saying? So, in fact, they confirmed to me that we don't have edition yet for my film. And so, since you, you... - An editor? - There's no editor? - Yes. - OK. Editor... whatever. Editor. And uh... Since the job is open, it could easily be yours, the editor job. - No kidding? - Not in the least. Well... Yeah! It's... I'm sorry, I don't know what to say, but... Just say yes. This is great, but... Don't you want to see my work before hiring me? No, I don't need to. I trust you. However, I... I want you to take off that jacket. What? I'd prefer if you didn't wear a jacket. Can you take it off, please? No. I'm comfortable with it. What's your deal? Are you some kind of pervert? No. I just want to be the only one wearing a jacket... Take it off, please. Are you messing with me? No, it's very serious. It's as important to me, as this job is to you. Indulge me and remove it. I want to be the only one wearing a jacket, it's not crazy. If it's to get me naked, forget it. It's not my thing. I assure you it's not at all sexual. Besides, look, I'm married. Well, I don't have it, but I usually wear a wedding ring. I just want to be the only one wearing a jacket, that's all. Indulge me. - There. - OK. And when do I start? You start now. You're hired. What will I edit if I have no images? I was expecting that! I expected this question. Hold on. Here are some images. Lots of them. Ah yeah, so it's not bullshit, then? Will I get a script too at some point, or...? Yeah... So... About that... Now that we're partners, I must tell you something important. I have a big hassle, super problematic. Because I got my credit card stolen yesterday. - Ah crap, who stole it? - It's doesn't matter. But I'm in deep shit, because I can't buy more cassettes, or get a script printed. So it's really not cool. I'm sorry to have to ask. I don't mind. We don't know each other well... When can they repay me, your producers? As soon as I contact them. Don't worry, they're serious people. They'll write you a check. - However, I need more than 500. - Really? Ah... That's a lot of cassettes. Fuck. Sick style. It's killer, eh? Is real deerskin? Yes, absolutely. - Sorry, I'm late. Johnny, right? - Yes. I'm George. We spoke on the phone. OK. I'm the filmmaker. OK. Today's a sort of casting? No, it's the... It's the shoot. Directly. There's no casting. - Straight away... - Yep. - Have you done this before? - No. You'll see, it's super simple. How many jackets did you bring? I brought all of them... Just like you asked. There are nine. You want me to try them on? - To see which will work? - No, it's no use. Put them directly in the trunk. Why? Because that's the scene. That's it, the scene. The guy in the scene, he says: "I promise to never again wear a jacket for the rest of my life." I promise to never again wear a jacket for the rest of my life. I promise to never again wear a jacket for the rest of my life. I promise to never again wear a jacket for the rest of my life. I promise to never again wear a jacket for the rest of my life. Then he puts everything in the trunk of the car. OK. Close the trunk. And... Cut. That's it, Johnny. Ah? Excuse me sir, but isn't your film a bit weird? - Not at all weird. It's genius. - Thank you. Obviously, you won't understand all of it, but it's great. - Well, thanks. - Yeah. Sir. Our jackets are in the trunk. Sir! The jackets... The jackets are still in the trunk! Ah, my jackets... You have... The... And... Cut. Here. This isn't 100. No, but it's end of the day, I have no money left. I'm tapped out. What's he still doing there? This kid won't stop following me. What are you doing there? You're following me? Are you deaf? Are you a deaf child? He's weird, isn't he? Why are you staring at me? What do you want? You didn't see anything. I need my jackets back. No. Since you promised never to wear one again. I've got filmed proof. You're screwed, I'm keeping them. Ciao. Hey! - How are you? - Fine, OK, thank you. We can talk a few minutes? Why are you filming me? What's the shot? - It's my job. - Ah yeah? I started editing. Yeah? I built up a scene... With your images, and my special machine. - You watched what I shot? - Should I not have? - Yes. Yes, yes. - OK. Of course. But... - You like it? - No, I love it. - It's a bit like a fake documentary. - Yeah. There's an super interesting rawness to it, I'm into that. I'm pleased. But to tell the truth, it's hard working without a script. But I really like it. And I think I can already guess what it's about. Ah yes? And... In your opinion, what's it about? I may be looking too deeply, but I think the real subject of the film is this jacket. Your jacket. More specifically, the fact we all wear a shell to hide in, to protect us from the outside world. - No? - Yeah... Am I close, or missing the point completely? You think it should be about that? It honestly seems like a good subject. Maybe that's what it's about. You're the one who knows. - Ah shit. - What? Shit. It's blocked. Here. Sorry, I can't get more. 80, that's all? Yeah. I never withdraw this much. It's blocked. Don't you have savings elsewhere? Like normal people? Elsewhere? - No. - No? I'm a waitress... Why have your producers left you in the shit? They're in Siberia. They're filming important stuff. What can I do with this? Ever seen a film shot for 80 francs? - I can try again. - Well... Go ahead. - Can't it wait until tomorrow? - I must shoot! - Take it easy! - Easy, but I have a film to make. - Can't you tap the cash at work? - No, that's dead. Nothing in the register. You're the only customer, have you noticed? Shit! Ciao. Goodbye then... Why are you filming me? What's the shot? It's my job. Ah yeah? Filming people who don't want to be filmed? - What kind of job is that? - It's called making a movie. It's called bothering people. Come on now, stop the camera. - Man I ask you a question? - Leave me alone! Would you take off your jacket and never wear it again? - To indulge me. - Whatever. - No? Any more stupid questions? It may seem odd, but it's very important to me. What could I do for you to agree? If you kill me, I might change my mind. Poor idiot! Come on, leave me alone now. Leave me! Nice camera work, George. You've got a knack. I know what you're going to say, don't bother. It was a nice tracking shot, but... We're no closer to our dream. I know. At this rate, you'll be the only one wearing a jacket in about 1,000 years. I know that! We can't let these morons keep us from our dream, George. We won't let them, but... It's a big dream. All these jackets to eliminate, it's a huge undertaking. It'll take time. I know what we'll do. Oh! OK but... Planting flowers is landscaping, not gardening, don't mix them up. Maybe he does both. No, it's not the same job. You see, it's like... It's the same type of profession. Wait, who's this guy? Hello. I do not like this, man. What do we do? I dunno. Would you like to help me fulfill my dream? Denise, despite the lack of means, I shot a scene tonight by the sweat of my brow. Appreciate these images, because they may be the last. Indeed, something terrible must have happened in Siberia, for the producers to leave me like this without any news. I don't think I'll have the strength to continue this film without the financial support it deserves. Unless you find a way to help me, of course. Regards, George. You poor fool! Come on, leave me alone now. Leave me! Oh! Yes! Fuck. Yeah. What? I watched the new tape. I'm so into it. Can we talk about it? - You want to have a meeting? - Yes. May I come in? Sure, but take that off. - That? - Yes. You know this. Everything OK? - And you? - Yeah. You notice something or not? Do you see a stain here? - No? - No. - It doesn't shock you? - No. Well the... So, this meeting? Here. What's this? To thank you for hiring me on your movie. I'm so very happy you trust me. And I wanted to apologize for not getting more money yesterday. I don't want you staying angry about that. You were able to get more? Yeah. I asked my boss for an advance. Your boss... But I'm your boss, right? At the bar. Ah yes. Yes, yes. Alright, sure. OK... well, thanks then. - It's soft... - Open it! Oh fuck. Do you like it? Oh fuck. But... No, you've gone crazy. - They're...? - Yeah, 100% deerskin. Mad classy. I love my life, thank you! I thank you, George. Wait, I'll try them on. - I can try them on? - Yes, of course. You're crazy! Oh no! - Oh my! - I'm glad you like them. - It's deerskin? Sure? - Yeah, sure. Wow! Hot damn! - Those are cool pants. - Just cool? - You sure? - Get a closer look? - Yeah. So, I was saying, I don't want to give you false hope, but I may know where to get money. - A lot? - Yeah, a lot. Enough to make the full movie. So... On the other hand, I need more images. So I can edit a teaser. And you need to film closer up. I need more action. I need more blood. "I need... I need..." Are you giving me orders? Yes I am. Here. To get a few more scenes. Off to work, then... Hey! Excuse me? I'm completely lost. Can you show me the way? - Yes. - Thank you. Are you crazy or something? George. George. George! - Good day. - Good day! So what's the job? It's about this. Here. You dig me a nice hole here. There. OK? And you... There, yeah. Then leave without asking any questions. Alright? I'll fill it back in myself. Wow. My father sold his butcher shop two years ago. He's loaded. - This is 50,000. - Ah yeah. - I'm taking over production. - Huh? You need financial support but also a guide. You can't go on alone, it's a mess. So I'll keep editing, and in addition, I produce. Translation, you're giving me this money or not? Translation, if I manage this money, it will be better spent and the film will be better. You need a producer, George. Clearly. Do you trust me, or not? - You're giving me this dough or what? - No! George, I want this money to go into the movie. "Into the movie"! - You have no idea what this all means? - What? You know nothing about it. About what? Siberia, that was bullshit. But not at all. It's not bullshit at all. They even sent a fax this morning. I swear. They sent a fax. They're all dead. A fax? Yes! They died in an avalanche, that's why I couldn't reach them. You don't seem too sad. I'm not sad because they were work relationships. I won't weep for them. They're dead, but sent a fax? - Yes. - George. I know it's bullshit. I knew that from the start. You are nothing and nobody. You have no production. You're just a guy all alone. Yes, I'm all alone. You're also all alone. It's true, I'm all alone too. And we are all alone. Point is, we could be alone together And we could make a great film. OK. You know what I'd like now? What? So? Otherwise, I have these, but they're synthetic. - Do I look like I'd wear synthetic? - You saw his sick style? Yes. We buying them? A very good choice. Where are we going? Shoot me. - Shoot me. - Wait. - OK, shooting. - Shoot me. Now, go ahead. Shoot me! Yes! Here! Shoot me! Yes, I'm shooting you!
