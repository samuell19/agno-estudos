Here I go! Scarlet Maid? Go. Are you alright? I'm fine, saved by your dart, or I'd be dead, because of the monk's staff. I regret that I haven't mastered Flying Dragon Darts. Let's go after the robbers. Don't bother. I'm not as skilled as those monks. If not for your darts, they wouldn't leave. My darts? I thought you wounded that fat monk? Fat monk? I didn't use a dart on him. How could that be? Let's go after them. Red darts again. Mind your own business Practise hard and revenge for your family Scarlet Maid has saved us twice today. Forget it. My dad told me when I was a kid, that Scarlet Maid is a martial arts expert, she comes and goes like the wind. I'm afraid she's already left. She's right. I should head back to the Gan's Fortress, practise more and then get my revenge. Return to Gan's Fortress? Only now I understand, that my fatherinlaw is a true swordsman. Very well, Gui Wu, let's go home. A young couple leaves home, armed with twin swords, going on an adventure. One is the beloved youngest daughter of the Gan Family, her martial arts passed down from older generations. "Repent and be saved" On this day, she broke her family ties, and follows her husband to travel around. Her husband is from a family of military officials, and his family was wronged. Looking up his partner at Gan Fortress, they can conquer it when the twin swords come together. Two more days and we're home... Two more days and we're home... Xiaowu, you don't want to go home? I worry that my fatherinlaw would lecture me, because we took off while he was away. Don't worry. I'd urge grandma to tell him it's a misunderstanding. Right, Lianzhu. Your nana loves you. Yes, let's go! Go! Now that White Doves Temple is destroyed, and we've blown our cover. Red Lotus Clan and the Gans are enemies, we couldn't take any chances. The two thieves are Gan Long's daughter and soninlaw. If they go back and report, the Gans will give us more trouble. Don't worry. The two won't make it home. What? You have any ideas? I've got the sedan chairs ready, and would tell the four women here posing as ordinary housewives, and I'll get my students to snatch them in front of the two thieves. Oh, no! Leave me alone! Help! They're kidnapping women. Let me go. Good plan. The Library of Scriptures is different now. While you were away at White Doves Temple, we've installed new traps here. Watch out! You installed after our master has left? When I left, the master gave his designs to Brother Faben. Look. When we walk up the stairs, it will close automatically. Follow me. There are lots of traps. Don't step on the tiles with pattern, only those which are plain. Look There's a board of daggers above, they'll be cut into pieces. Walk on the level ground. Not here. Isn't this level ground? There's a net underneath, it could trap a person, and we can shoot arrows from all sides. Good trap. Tell me, how likely is it for outsiders to walk out of here? You make this sound so good, where are the outsiders? On their way. Tired? Strange. Seems like you don't have much spirit these few days. Me? Looking at monks snatching women, and I couldn't do a thing. Have you forgotten about what Scarlet Maid told us? Mind your own business Saving lives isn't minding others' business. I don't know where the monks went. I do, towards Red Lotus Temple. There's a sign by the path earlier. Let's go and save those women! Come on! Very well, just this once. Great. So tired... What are you doing? You. You can walk upstairs now. Coming... Let's go. Your student dragged me, it hurts. Thanks for all your hard work today. Good job. We're all doing it for the clan. Master, those two are here. Would I be wrong? Where are they? At the front entrance. At the front entrance? "Red Lotus Temple" Let's get prepared. Prepare for what? We've so many traps here, we don't need to do the work ourselves. Now that they've walked into Red Lotus Temple. They could've chosen a good route, but they've picked the route straight to hell. Right, they're heading straight to hell. Where's your Abbot? I'll inform him. This way. The couple is here, I don't care about the man, but keep the woman for me. Certainly. If not for her at the White Doves Temple, we wouldn't have lost so terribly. Do we have to kill her? What a waste. Let's not worry about this, we must catch them first. Zhineng is here. There's a couple outside, they fit your description. Have you got them? Not yet. Zhiming has brought them to the dinner hall. Why didn't you lead them to the Library of Scriptures? Didn't you say we need to catch them alive? Right... Tell me, where are you hiding the women you kidnapped? I don't know anything about that. Lianzhu, don't be rash. He's not going anywhere. Let's see who isn't. Lianzhu. What now? It's a trap. Run! How could I? We can't just wait here and die. Go back to Gan Fortress, beg my nana and mom to save me. Be careful. Xiaowu, what are you doing? At the back. Gui Wu, both sides! Zhiyuan, don't bother. Why not, master? Let him go, he'll be back. He will? Great! That way he'll bring the Gan family here. Good. I know! The monks! This isn't the easiest way out, but it's the safest. After passing here it's the back of Scriptures library Look, chaps, we're the real monks of Red Lotus Temple. Except a few they took as labourers, they've all been locked up. So they are fake monks. I risked my life to save you so that you could save them. Please help us! Now isn't a good time. If you set them free, they can't fight their way out. Please ask for more help. Very well, lead me out of here. Yes. Look, that's the backdoor of the temple. She ran to the Library of Scriptures. Go after her! We must keep the woman alive. No one lives when they enter the Library of Scriptures. How could that be? You promised I could have her. Zhiyuan, turn off all the traps. Yes. Let's go to the second floor, and turn the traps off. Yes. What do you think? See, I told you! That woman is not easy to handle. So we're keeping her alive not entirely because of me. And the last time? Last time... if not for the Scarlet Maid. Even if the Scarlet Maid shows up now, she'd end upjust like you. Don't be mad. Faben said so. In a few days, you can have a family reunion here. Lianzhu is trapped in Red Lotus Temple. A warrior of the Gan Fortress is thinking about her. He took her handkerchief in secret. Fell in love with her learning martial arts together. But she married Gui Wu. Worries that he has no reason to live now she's gone. Willing to sacrifice for love. But would it be a waste! But would it be a waste? Xiaoling. Xiaoling, return it. No. Come on! Return it to your uncle. No! I know this is my aunt's. No, it isn't. But I've seen her using it. I know you're waiting for her to come home. Says who? If not then what are you doing here? I... My aunt told me that she would be back soon. I guess they are lying. Xiaoling is right. Come on, return the handkerchief to me. Do you think my aunt lied to me? I've told you, give me my handkerchief. Fine. They took off from home when the old master wasn't around. They can't come back anymore. They can't? What? You're back? Where's Lianzhu? She was captured by the Red Lotus Clan. Got captured? Yes, I'm here to beg granny and the rest of the family to save her. You took off with her, but you couldn't protect her? I... Brother Du Let me go in and tell the grandmother. I don't think it's a good idea. You left the Gan Fortress, and you're no longer family. I'd pass the message for the sake of Lianzhu. Thank you, Brother Du. Xiaoling, let's go. I'll be back. You said my aunt was captured by the Red Lotus Clan. How come you're here? I... Sisterinlaw, Lianzhu is your daughter. On behalf of elder brother you must make a decision since he's away Yes, motherinlaw. But... Mom, you must beg the great grandmother. My poor uncle is really worried. Grandmother, what should I tell him? Send him away. Yes. Tell him if he dares to return, I'd take him as an intruder. Yes. Fatherinlaw. Why are you in this state? Lianzhu and I... What happened? Chief Gan. What's going on? He took off with Lianzhu while you were away. Lianzhu and him? Yes, he just returned. And now he says Red Lotus Clan has captured Lianzhu at Red Lotus Temple. And the rest of the family? All in the hall. Grandfather is back. You've heard about Lianzhu and her husband? Yes. Eldest brother, Lianzhu's wrong that she left home when you were away. But she did it according to the book, she fought her way out a step at a time. Really? With her skills? There's no use to say such things. She's been captured by Red Lotus Clan, we should think of a plan to save her. What did mom say? She sternly refused Mom. Good that you're home, make them stop. I've been waiting for you, look. Since Lianzhu left the family base, that means she's breaking her family ties. We save outsiders being captured by Red Lotus Clan, but not my own younger sister? Brotherinlaw has a point. Lianzhu is captured by the Red Lotus Clan, of course we should save her. But people are tricky, can we trust Gui Wu? I think it's best if we could investigate on our own at Red Lotus Temple. I think... Whom do we send? I'm willing to go at night, if Gui Wu's telling the truth, I'll save Lianzhu. Good idea. It could be a trap, that while the family is out, they will do something to hurt us. That's what I think. You must be careful. Since they've a hostage of the Gan Family, I'm sure they will step out their security. Xiaoling. Grandmother told you to go in. Thank you, Xiaoling. Follow me. Mom, I beg you to save Lianzhu, mom. I told you to come in so that you could eat something. Mom, Lianzhu has been take hostage, she's in danger. Food is the last thing on my mind, she's waiting for our help. You've starved for a day. I know I'm wrong. I shouldn't have taken off with her, not before we've explained everything. And look what I got her into. As long as Lianzhu could be saved, I could sacrifice my life, starving is nothing. You left the Gan Fortress, so you're no longer part of our family. Motherinlaw, I'm responsible for it, Do it according to the family rules; Even if you have to kill me, I'd have no complaints. But Lianzhu is your flesh and blood, save her. You know we have family rules, I can't make such a decision. Stand up and eat something. Motherinlaw, I beg you... Mother. Grandmother, for my poor uncle's sake, help him to beg great grandmother's help. Grandmother... Mother. Grandmother... Grandmother says yes, you should eat. Thank you, motherinlaw. Motherinlaw. Xiaoling, you've some nerve! My uncle has kneeled outside for a day. Motherinlaw. I'm at fault, I know Xiaowu hasn't eaten the whole day, that's why I told Xiaoling to bring him in. You're very kind, but have you forgotten our family rules? I said it, as long as he dares to walk through the door, I'd take him as an intruder. I brought him in. Xiaoling. Mother, what do you plan to do? Since we've sent Du Zhuang to investigate, let's wait till he's back, then you can punish Xiaowu. Kick him out. Great grandmother... What? You dare to fight in here? I dare not, I just beg you to hear me out. You're not a part of the family. But Lianzhu is. Lianzhu made herself clear that she obeys her husband, her surname is Gui now. Grandmother, you've always loved her. Say no more, get out! You don't need to kick me out, grandmother. I'll walk out myself. I just beg you to remember that Lianzhu is also a Gan girl. Say, where's Miss Gan? Speak up. You won't? The top floor in Library of Scriptures. Bring me there. Come on... cheers... Drink up. Cheers... Cheers... That man is headed towards the Library of Scriptures. He knows that Miss Gan is there? I guess so. Just as I expected, they did send someone here to take a look. What did I tell you? We're dangling the bait. But Zhiyuan and four other members are dead. What? Then we should have gone there much sooner. There's no need to do that anymore. As long as he is inside the Library of Scriptures, it's time for his death. Let's go take a look. Alright. Don't step on the tiles with pattern. Other than those traps earlier, I'm not familiar with here either. Brother Du. Lianzhu. Brother Du, come and save me. Lianzhu. At least I could do something for you. Brother Du... Brother Du... Brother Du... Lianzhu. It's my fault. Look, Lianzhu. That's my handkerchief. Lianzhu, I'd do anything for you. And now, I... Brother Du. Go! Why isn't Du Zhuang back yet? What's taking him so long? He's been gone for a day and a night. Xiaowu has been waiting for a day and a night. Uncle isn't just waiting, he's kneeling outside. Who told you to speak? A child shouldn't talk too much. Your grandfather is worrying. No matter what, he should have at least sent a message. Younger brother... Uncle Du Zhuang. Younger brother... Great grandmother... Get up. Listen to Madam Sumei. Yes. Sumei, please take care of things here. Be careful. I know, mother. You must be careful. Go on in. Yes. Aren't you leaving first? We can still make it on time. Alright, let's go. You're going to Red Lotus Temple? Lianzhu is saved! Fatherinlaw, I'll lead the way. Stay out of this, it's our family business. Let me go! I'm going to Red Lotus Temple. Let me go! I must go save Lianzhu. It was a lot of work to get hold of this lute. Singing a song to express my feelings. My feelings are the same no matter how much time past. Fallen blossoms turned into dirt. No one pays attention to the fallen blossoms. The sound of the lute signifies killings. It's a turbulent world out there, trouble is brewing all along. Red Lotus Temple... We're being followed. Could it be fatherinlaw and Jiaqi? They're ahead of us, it's impossible. Who is it? Step out. Great grandmother... Xiaoling, why are you following us? Send her back. Yes, motherinlaw. Great grandmother, I want to go too. You want to go? Let me go, great grandmother. Very well, it's a chance for her to learn. Wait. For you, our family heirloom, the Fish Intestine Sword which cuts all kinds of iron. Thank you, great grandmother. Let's go. Mom, there's no sign. What's Xiaoling doing here? Grandfather. I brought her. Go! Hold on. You, to the back. Yes. Jiaqi, take the east. Yes. Mom, we'll go through the front. Go! Grandfather. Xiaoling, go! Now! Hurry! Come on, let's go! Gan Xing, go in and tell the old madam to watch the traps. Master Sit. Time to eat. Mother. Great grandmother. Xiaoling, you saved us! I killed three monks as well. Had you just been a little bit late... Xiaoling. Grandfather, grandmother. Mom, are you alright? I wonder how they're doing. Let's look for them. Master Jiaqi, we've reached the main hall. Let's go. Gan Xing. Master Jiaqi, your uncle is dead. Where? A trap at the back. Where are you hiding Miss Gan? Speak up! Aunt, I'm telling the truth. I've made up my mind, I'd die with Lianzhu. She told you to come back for help? Yes, who'd guess that I got locked up here. I don't know whether she's still alive. I fear that I won't get to see her. My brother's always like this. Aunt, have pity on me and Lianzhu, let me go to Red Lotus Temple. It's not up to me. Aunt... I don't care, you think of something. Aunt... Jiaqi. Grandmother, dad. What is it, Jiaqi? Have you seen your uncle? He's dead, there's a trap. Gan Xing's dead also. Great uncle. Mom, we'll get even. Do you know the whereabouts of your sister? The monk said Lianzhu is locked up inside the Library of Scriptures. Let's go! Follow me. Wait, be careful. Gan Zhi. Master Jiaqi. So? Are you alright? I'm fine, but Gan Zhi... Follow me. Alright. Xiaoling, what did you step on? This tile moves. Let me lead the way. I got it. The tiles with patterns are traps, walk on the plain tiles. Master, they're good. We have lots of casualties. I've a complaint. You've sent Huafu out, That's right, Gan family home is an empty fort. But our Head isn't here, Huafu isn't here. We don't have enough manpower either. We may lose skillwise. But we have traps. They've killed so many of us before entering the building. How could we tell the Head? As long as we've taken care of the Gan Family, our Head won't blame us. Dad. Jiaqi, didn't I tell you to be careful? I'm not being careless. I spotted Lianzhu. Where? Upstairs. Upstairs? Slowly, watch below your feet. Don't make any big moves. Could Lianzhu be... Lianzhu, grandmother is here, talk to me. Maybe she's been drugged. Why isn't aunt moving? Come here, child. Lianzhu. Aunt. Sister... Child... Shut up. Your four generations could ascend into heaven soon. Brother, you are right. The Gan Family walked into our trap, they're behind the copper door. Alright, Zhiming. Here. Light the poisonous smoke. Yes. Go to the bellows, make sure the smoke gets blown up. Yes. Master, how much longer will it take? About the time it takes to burn an incense stick. We'll wait upstairs. Alright. Mom, what's that terrible smell? Don't panic, treat it like we're praticising, just regulate your breathing. There's no use. Just wait, it will get better. You're right. When you feel the best, then it's almost time. The Head would approve of all these. He's not here. And we've got rid of our biggest enemy. Evil monk. Tell me where Miss Gan is, speak up. She and the rest of the Gans are caught upstairs. You're hurting them? No... it's not my fault. The master told me to do this, to smoke them out. What's going on? It's stopped? Hurry and take a look. Yes. Bring me upstairs to where they are. Me? Go! Yes. Who saved us? We're all here. An outsider? Outsider? Who? All of us are here. Check on Lianzhu. Yes. Sister... Aunt. Lianzhu. Go! I'm sorry that I couldn't get here sooner. I caught him, he's responsible for the smoke. Brotherinlaw, could you watch him? Alright. Lianzhu, I'm back. Lianzhu... Is aunt sleeping or dead? No... Lianzhu, how could you? Why didn't you wait for me? You told me to go home for help. Lianzhu. Poor kid. Sister. Lianzhu. What did you do to her? Tell me. Mom, she's not aunt. Aunt doesn't have nails that long. So the Red Lotus Clan would resort to such a low trick. Where are you hiding Miss Gan? Tell me. She didn't eat for several days. Then a swordswoman in red outfit saved her. This woman was just a replacement, to trick you here. Let's go. Let's return home and think of another plan. Oh... Escaping from the den of evil, with the help of Scarlet Maid. She's led me to a magical place, a place where fairies live. Oh... a place where fairies abide. This mountain is amazing, so is its occupant. Who would have imagined to come by a friend here! Surprised and glad. Feeling appreciated. Feeling appreciated. Couldn't wait to fly home at once. Just anxious whether I could see him again. Whether I could see him again. If only Xiaowu was here! You're constantly thinking about Xiaowu. Xiaowu is a good man. I know, he's very much like his dad. You knew him. He's my nephew. You're his aunt that he's been looking for. Aunt. Get up. Thanks, aunt. When you saved him, why didn't you tell him? When I first met him, he's heading to your home. I thought your wedding is more important. Then I found out that we have lots of enemies, I thought it's best for him to stay with the Gan Family Work on his skills. If you've found out who his enemies are, why didn't you get even for him? It's his job to avenge his own father. Yes, aunt. Xiaowu will remember to get even. You're always speaking for him. I'm telling the truth, aunt. If that's the case, hurry and go to him. Go to him? I can't. I don't know my way home. It's very near, just over the hills. Let me take you to your home. Sure. What's the noise? Follow me. Not everyone gets to see this lute. How come it's making a sound on its own? A long story. This lute was a product of the Warring States period, this is the Phoenix Lute. Everyone said you're talented, not only a martial arts expert, and you're good at the arts and music. Could you play for me? This lute is not used as a musical instrument. Then The maker of the lute, was allegedly Gongsu Ban of Lu. Gongsu Ban? The man who specialised in making traps? Yes, the Phoenix Lute is a murder weapon. Look. So powerful. The needles are as small as the hairs on an animal. It's impossible to guard against within 500 steps. Spells instant death if hit at the vital parts. Can't live over five days if hit elsewhere. Only the Seven Stars Stone of the Sun Family in Baifu could draw the needles out. Aunt, please teach me how to use this. This is an extremely vicious weapon, what's the point to learn it? Let me teach you another trick. Check this out What do you think? Great, please teach me. I've something for you. I saw you and Gui Wu practising swordplay on your wedding night. And I wrote this guide based on the style and physique of you both. I'll pass this on to you. I'm sure, practice with Gui Wu will advance your skills. I also wrote the way to use the Golden Rings in it. Thanks, aunt. After doing this favour I need you to do something. I'm at your service. This lute isn't made of wood or stone, it's very strong Ordinary swords can't cut it open, only your family's Fish Intestines Sword could destroy it. I want you to take this lute back home, and destroy it with the Fish Intestines Sword. Destroy such a gem? This lute is very wicked; In the right hands it could be controlled, but that means there's no use of it. But in the wrong hands, this could have drastic effects, The noise means the lute wanted to destroy something. That's why we must destroy it. Now that you've control of it, it won't end up in the wrong hands. But I can't keep an eye on it forever, what about a century or two later? Hide it safely. The land keeps changing, even if we bury it somewhere, it will be discovered sooner or later. Gan Fortress. Gan Fortress? Something happened at your home. Let me send you there. Yes What about the Phoenix Lute? We still aren't done dealing with the Red Lotus Clan, let's leave it here for now. We'll worry about this later. Yes. Let's go. Grandmother, mom, Gui Wu Mom Grandmother... Mom, grandmother... Aunt, it's me, Lianzhu. Miss Gan. It's you! If only you were here sooner. Where's grandmother and mom? They've gone to save you at Red Lotus Temple. You didn't see them? She saved me. Red Lotus Clan raided the Gan Fortress when it's empty. Aunt... Aunt... Gan Long, you're still alive. Fatherinlaw, he's also the leader of Red Lotus Clan This is your doomsday. You've over estimated yourself. Even if you live, you won't have a home to return to. I've burnt down your home. Bastard. Aunt... Go! Mom, let's go back and take a look. My sister could be... Let's go! What's your background? Gan Long of Gan Fortress. You're the one who fought with us time after time? Evil can never prevail over good. You've killed all my students? That's right. Gan Long, how dare you come here and kill my students while I was away! In that case, I suppose you are the head of Red Lotus Clan? What else do you have to say? You all want to challenge me together, or one by one? Let me. Careful, he knows qigong. Do you have any other tricks? My turn then. Scarlet Maid. I've been looking for you for a while. Me? You left Daming County and came here, teamed up with others, pretending to be monks. Today I ought to avenge the death of Gui Family in Daming County. Gui Family of Daming County? So you are Gui Qiu, the one who wasn't home at the time Quite a reputation you made as Scarlet Maid these years Scarlet Maid, you're my aunt Qiu? Many a time you've saved me, I... Zhong Yan, now that you know who I am, prepare for your death! I don't think so. You know qigong too. Grandma. Lianzhu... Lianzhu... Xiaowu. Xiaowu, burn that side. Mom. Lianzhu... Aunt. Xiaoling. Sisterinlaw. Sister. Grandmother, our home was burnt down. My aunt was killed by the Red Lotus Clan. Xiaowu, let me tell you Scarlet Maid is your father's sister. I know that. Grandmother, why isn't the old monk moving? Scarlet Maid has stopped him from doing so. Thanks, Scarlet Maid. It's been a while. We never expected that you'd save us here! Thank you for your help. This concerns my family also. I've been trying to hunt down Zhong Yan for quite long. I've seen Gui Wu several times, but was worried that Zhong Yan had too many henchmen, that's why I didn't disclose my identity. And I thought he's safer in Gan Fortress. Who would have thought? Lianzhu has told you about the death of Madam Gan? I was careless. No, it's fate. Xiaowu and the rest are alright now, thanks to you, Lianzhu. Aunt, I've done what you told me. Good. Aunt, I've been looking for you everywhere. Mom, so Scarlet Maid is Gui Zhong's sister. I only know that her maiden name is Gui. Get up, Xiaowu. He's your father's killer. Go get your revenge! That old thief. You old thief. Now, it's payback time! For the deaths of my parents, and my wife's aunt. Let's get out of here. Sure. It's important to root out the evil. All the traps & snares have turned into ashes. The Red Lotus Temple was torched down. Once the family grudges have been resolved, the young couple will go on their adventure armed with their Twin Swords.
