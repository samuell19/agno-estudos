Medicine. Hurry up. Hurry up. Medicine. Master. For all these years, I've been trying to save myself. Now I think I can't make it. Yang De. You've been studying for three years. You know I'm the head of the Five Venoms house. Yes. It is a well-known enemy of the martial arts world. We live here quietly. Here we may talk about the House openly. But when you enter the boxer's world, a mere mention of the House is likely to put you in great danger. Why? We didn't do anything wrong. Didn't we? You don't understand. Before you came here, the House had accepted five students at different times. I have five seniors? What are their names? - Where are they? - When our students leave here, the first thing to do is to have new names. They must keep their backgrounds as secret as possible. These five students of mine, some of them didn't know each other. You learned part of the martial arts as they had learned here. But your skills aren't sophisticated enough. I won't live any longer. After you learn their skills, I want you to do something for me. First I will let you know in detail the skills I've taught them. These are the art of the House. It used to be the training room. You have five seniors. I will start with the oldest one. He's Zhang Yiaotian. He's practicing the Centipede Style. His nickname is "Thousand Hands." He is well known for his quick moves. It's like he has thousands of hands. The second one is called Qi Dong. He's practicing the Snake Style. He's nicknamed "Snake Spirit Dude." The right hand is the head of the snake, the left hand the tail. He's famous for his responsive moves. Fast, just like a snake. The third one is called Gao Ji. He's practicing the Scorpion Style. ln this style, the hands move like a cutter. The feet like a scorpion's. I accepted him later than the others. The eldest and the second didn't know each other. Before them, I took in your fourth and fifth seniors. The fourth one is called Meng Tianxia. He's older than the second and third one. He's learning the Gecko Style. He's trained to have a light body and strong legs so he can crawl with ease. He also made use of the rebound force to enhance his own power. Your fifth senior is Liang Shan. He's practicing the Toad Style. Meng and Liang didn't meet the other seniors as well. The Toad Work at its full strength can resist the attack of swords and spears. It can break hard objects, too. You came here for a very short time. I made a mistake to teach you all these skills. As such, you're not as good as any one of them. If you were to fight against any of your seniors, you're no match for them. I don't have any time left to teach you further. You've got to combine your own skills with any work of the House. Then you may take on any of them. Our Five Venoms House has done many bad things. I don't know if your seniors behave themselves in the boxer's world outside. It's my decision to abort the Five Venoms House. Now the responsibility is yours. - Master, l-- - You're to finish them for me. You'll leave here tomorrow to locate the five of them. . . and keep an eye on their behavior. You may leave the one who behaves well alone and take on the one who doesn't. Master, it's a big, big world outside, full of people. They've changed their names already. Besides, unless it reaches a very critical moment, we won't reveal our skills. Master. You must do it for me. I promise you I will. I know it's a difficult task. If they discover your background, you'll be in great danger. Master, my safety isn't important. Where should I go? There's one more disciple of our House. He happens to be my junior classmate, but he has retired from the boxer's world. He still possesses some precious treasures. They're the ill-gotten gains of the House. He leads a quiet life in a small town. At present, I only know the name of the town, but not exactly his name or identity. You find him and ask him to donate the treasure for charity. My intuition tells me the treasure is the source of the disasters. I think the five senior schoolmates of yours are trying to look for it. How skillful is he as a boxer? He's no match for your seniors. Mr. He. Yuanxin, you're a policeman. You'd better behave yourself. You shouldn't eat irresponsibly. It would be greatly appreciated if you paid me a little respect. I've always owed you many a favor. Yuanxin, don't ruin your reputation because of petty gains. Please spare me goodness next time when Mr. Ma isn't around. Ma is a disciplined man. I can't take advantage because of him. No kidding, Mr. He. Hi. What's that? That habitual gambler lost money to me. Screw you. Sir, who were the two men? Well, they're Mr. He and Mr. Ma. They're the officers of the court. Mr. He is very kind and willing to help. If I want to find someone. . . I'm the right person to ask. I've been living here for 60 years. I know not only the people but the dogs and cats. The person I'm looking for is about 60 years old. He should be a very wealthy man, a good fighter, and-- No idea, right? You're bluffing. Wake up. Look. Who is the banker? I'm making a bet. Yuanxin. We're civil servants. We ought to present good ideals. Gambling isn't allowed. Let's have a drink. Okay. He's the boss. Bullshit. What are you doing here? Go away. Can't I just look from outside? Damn you! Get lost! Don't look down on him. Come in. What do you want? He-- Please. I'm sorry. I'm expecting someone. Suit yourself. Okay. Hey! What do you want? I want this, this, and this. Mr. He. It's you. Waiter, bring me nothing but a bottle of wine. That's a good idea. It's easier for a civil servant to look for somebody. There are more chances to find him. It's been a year. We've been making a thorough search for all the families. There is still no clue. Master could be wrong. What about you? Do you know where the other three seniors are? No, I don't. If they knew Master's schoolmate is here, - it's possible they would have come. - Very likely. Because of this, Master wants us to find him first and ask him to donate the treasure so that the disaster can be wiped out. You shouldn't be that mean and selfish. The students of Five Venoms House dare not reveal their backgrounds. - Let's go. - Yes, sir. Senior. Qi Dong, you're good. If I hadn't heard the news, l'd have assumed that you'd already taken the treasure. So the news confirmed he's living in this town. Who? You'd never have imagined this. It's-- Sir, still not going home? I haven't finished my work, so I have to try harder. What's taking you so long to open the door? Respected sirs, I'm just a poor scholar. There's no money in my house. Please leave me alone. Uncle, stop pretending. No one would suspect you would work as a bookkeeper in a government office. You must be the Snake. Usually you never use a sword. Okay. So you're the Thousand Hands. You're no longer a member of the House. Hand over the treasure. We only want the treasure, not your life. You can't fool me. Did you ever let your victims stay alive? I know you'll surely be killed. But at least you don't want to suffer. Shit. I just bet on the wrong side. The dice always give me bad luck. You overdid it. I'll tear down his house to find what I want. Why are you laughing? It's because you're full of bullshit. We're in a big county. There is law and order. You can't mess around like this. Thanks to you, the whole thing is ruined. What a joke. For all these years, you haven't found a thing. It all depends on me. What are you up to? I'm the senior member. You're the second one. Even if I did something wrong, it's none of your business. You aren't the only one to find the treasure. Don't forget there's a third brother. Gao Jim? The Scorpion? Yuan is getting worse and worse. We have an emergency. He should have come here to report. Why are you staring at your superior? Don't you know the rules? Sir, bad news. Yuan and his family are all dead. Hurry up. They all got killed. We're going to investigate this. - Where's Yuanxin He? - Probably at the pub. - Bring him back now. - Yes, sir. Don't go back to the office. Go directly to Yuan's house. Yes, sir. We're good fighters for nothing. We dare not show our skills, hiding and shrinking away like morons. We're students of the Five Venoms Clan. What are you looking at? Haven't you ever seen anyone practice inner power? Brother He, there's a serious case. Yuan and his relatives were all killed. Let's go. Yuan the bookkeeper? Who's he? You wait here. I'll be right back. Who is he? A friend I just met. So the Yuan family was murdered. Yes. He wasn't rich. What could have been the motive? Here. You beggar, do you want to die? Menfa, you're always so enthusiastic whenever you play dice. What happened? Nothing. Nothing at all. Mr. He, I need to talk to you. - I'm busy. - It's important. Talk to me later. Hey. Do you believe I saw the one who murdered the Yuan family? Stop daydreaming. You'd be dead if you saw the murderer. The murderer didn't notice me. Yuan was a poor scholar. Why would somebody be after his entire family? The murderer not only killed them, but also trashed the house, as if there were some great treasure hiding in it. Treasure! - Hey! - Watch out! The skull of a male victim was broken. The legs are broken off at the knee. There are eight, ten, 1 2 broken ribs. How many ribs were broken, exactly? Sir, all the ribs were broken. It's an extremely serious case. If I can't crack it, I'll lose my post as head of the county. I will do my best. The killer was ruthless, probably not a local. I've instructed my staff to keep an eye on strangers for the next few days. Yuanxin He, you should have been standing by at the office. - Where were you? - Sir, I'm making an investigation. Yuanxin, what did you find? A boy's body. A broken bone in the neck. - Let's take a look? - Where are you going? Just having a look. Whoever is making that noise will be beaten with a stick. An order from the governor-- whoever is making that noise will be beaten with a stick. Get out! Go! So it's the Yuan murder case. You've got to work on this case around the clock. This case must be solved within ten days. Anyone going one day past that will be caned ten times, two days, 20 times. Adjourned. Ma, there's not any clue at all. It probably couldn't be solved in six months. We're policemen. - If we pass the due date-- - What can we do? I'll be punished with the caning as well. - What can we do? - Stop it! - I've discovered something. - What is it? I don't mean to look down on you guys, but you're not the ones to break this case. I have to have some help. Ma, I want to have a day off. A day off now? I'm not taking a vacation. I'll be working on the case. Yl AN lNN I never expected Uncle to work in a government office. No wonder we couldn't locate him. Who did it? The skull and the ribs were all broken. It's the work of the Thousand Hands. Broken organs and serious bleeding, it's the work of the Snake. The eldest and second seniors? Master longed to get rid of them. I must get them for whatever reason. Don't worry. I must. Hey, let me go! Let go of me. Where's your mask? Why are you hiding outside? I need to see Mr. He. What are you practicing? It hurts much worse than hitting a rock. - This is-- - Shut up. Someone said he'd seen the murderer. Who? You? Not me. It's Menfa. Okay. Start talking. Oh, God. What should I say? You want to tell me in the daylight, right? Tell me who the murderer is. The office didn't offer a reward. I may give you ten silver taels. Mr. He, I'll tell you. No need to scare me. The murderer has grown a beard. I've seen him in Hong's house. Wentong Hong? I'm scared I'll be in danger. Don't worry. You may stay in the prison for a few days. Hong? I've met him a few times. Is he the Thousand Hands or the Snake? No one knows now. He's a wealthy businessman here. I can't make a reckless move. We have to wait till he leaves his house. Who's the murderer? Thousand Hands, Snake, or Scorpion? I don't care. The underlings in the office are no match for them. I'll take care of Hong. You help me arrest the murderer. Okay. Wentong Hong? Brother He, did you get it wrong? He's a good friend of the governor. He's close to the officers in the province. This is the difficult part. Let's wait outside. When the murderer is out, I'll try to detain Hong inside. You guys do your job. I know you can't arrest the murderer. I've asked someone to help. Who? A new friend. A very good boxer. What? I've contributed. Can I go with you? - You wait here. - Okay. Better hide somewhere farther away. I understand. Mr. He-- What brings you here? Something really poisonous. What kind of poison? It could be the poison of the centipede, snake, or the scorpion. What's the riddle? I don't understand. I don't care if you understand or not. The truth will be revealed soon. Here he is. Buddy, he's the criminal! What did I do? You murdered 1 1 members of the Yuan family. I'm called Tao Li now. What is your real name? The Toad Style? Since you know me, you should show me your skills. What kind of blade do you want? Pretending doesn't work. You're the Thousand Hands, our eldest senior. Thanks. Please go to the office with me. No, thanks. The eldest and fifth seniors appear. I wonder if the other three-- - Stop. - We got it! We got the murderer. The lord will hold a court session. - Mr. Hong, do you want to take a seat? - There's nothing interesting to watch. But if the murderer makes a statement about his accomplice, it'll be interesting. Yuanxin He! Yes, sir? What can I do for you? Kneel down! You lawless villain, confess now. I did nothing wrong. I have nothing to confess. - Bring in Menfa. - Menfa! Menfa, the night the murder happened, did you see this man? That's him. Get the punishment tools ready. - Hurry, get the tong sticks. - Yes, sir! It's a false accusation! False accusation! Shanhui Tan, you'll confess sooner or later. You've no need to suffer. Why should I confess? I just have to bear the torture this time. Court adjourned. Sir-- How dare you, Yuanxin He? - Third brother? - The fifth brother is coming. If it hadn't been for him, the eldest wouldn't be arrested. You want to shift the blame on him. Get rid of him, or I won't sleep well. Fifth brother practices the Toad Style. It's not easy to get rid of him. We'll do it quietly. You arrange the trap. It seems that Uncle didn't get the treasure. It could be merely a rumor. We spent years of our effort for nothing. What's the problem? ln this small town, we're like kings. - Master. - What? Mr. Wang is here? That quick? - Bring him in. - Yes, sir. Please. It's a pleasure to have you here, Mr. Wang. - Please sit. - Please. The murderer in Yuan's case was arrested. I know. Here's a money order for 5,000 silver taels. This is a very big case. I can't make a decision. Don't worry. You won't lose your post. I wonder if I couldn't catch the murderer. You may find someone to be a scapegoat. Don't worry. This man is a well-known boxer. We're not losing people at random for this. It's like you're doing my work. You're only looking for money. So don't take it too seriously. It doesn't matter who makes the decision. One more thing, you have to send Yuanxin He somewhere else. I know. You may have Guang Lin to do it. Sir, what's the matter? This is Mr. Hong. Yes, Mr. Hong. I need you to do something. - Just listen to Mr. Hong's order. - Yes. Mr. Hong. Open it. Are you letting me go? I need to talk to Menfa alone. No problem. This is the easiest way. Right. Take your time. Menfa, you're the prime witness of this case. You're the only one who saw the murderer. The murderer. I told them, and the murderer was arrested. Something's wrong. What did he look like? He's a fierce man with a big beard. Not correct. He's a young man, about 20 years old. Strong and beardless. No. He has a big beard. Say it again. What did the murderer look like? A man with a big beard. No. I mean a young man of 20. - And? - Strong and beardless. It's clear this time. Will you say the same in court? I understand. I'll say it clearly in court. Bring Yuanxin He. Sir. Sir? I need you to send an important letter to the province city. - Leave now. - Sir, that's not my job. Do you refuse my order? We must detain Tan carefully. I know he has companions outside. Enough. Stop it. This letter is very important. I need you to deliver it quickly. I'll make my way day and night. I'll come back very quickly. Leave now. Yes, sir. Bring me Duty Constable Ma and Lin. Yes. Bring Constable Ma and Lin! The murderer is still running free. You guys evaded your responsibility and arrested innocent people to take the blame. - The statement of Menfa-- - Can we count on his statement? He has revised his statement. He now says the murderer is a man of 20, strong and beardless. He's now in the wine house on the south side of town. Arrest him now. If he goes free, you're in big trouble. Where is he? Where is Ma? He's out to carry out the orders. Brother He, didn't Ma tell you? Shit. The lord suddenly asked me to send a letter. I just want to tell Ma about it. Which case was Ma working on? The Yuan case. We've already arrested Shanhui Tan. - It could be-- - Menfa suddenly revised his statement, saying the murderer wasn't Tan but a young man of 20, strong and beardless, always hanging around the wine house on the south side of town. Ma is going there with his men. What? Brother Ma. Did the murderer make a statement? Not yet, but-- - What? - Tao Li, are you resisting arrest? Bullshit. What did I do? According to Menfa's statement, you're the suspect in the Yuan case. What rubbish! I don't have time to mess with you. Yuanxin He. He's the prime suspect in the case. - What are you doing? - I guarantee he is innocent. He helped me to arrest Tan. How could you be so stupid? The court will decide whether he's innocent. Your words carry no weight. You won't let me arrest him. That's a serious offense. Yuanxin, you better think carefully. If Li has nothing to do with the case, it won't harm him to appear in court. We won't give him a hard time. I'm not going to see Tan and Menfa in court. Better make it clear. Then the lord can sentence Tan to jail. We can't just believe Menfa's testimony. - You must go with us. - That's right. No, Brother He. I didn't see the dirty tricks in the office, but I heard a lot. We're friends, after all. What do you mean? Go. I can guarantee your safety. I'll see you here again after the court session. You wait here for me. Okay. I'll go, just for your sake. Please. It's a coincidence. The lord asked me to deliver an urgent letter. I need to go to the city now. Please take care of Li for me. He is a boxer. He doesn't obey the rules of the office. Don't worry. You better go. It's a serious offense if you fail. I helped with the arrest of Tan. He's the prime suspect in Yuan's case. Did you arrest Tan at Yuan's house? No, but did someone see him walking from the Yuan residence? - Menfa. - Present. Menfa, you must tell us honestly, who was walking out from Yuan's house? It's him. Bastard! What are you talking about? How dare you shout in court! Menfa, speak up. I'll make the final decision. It was him. Bastard! Who ordered you to say this? Arrest him! Li, you should have respected the court. You tried to frame me with this trap. But I'm no fool. Sir, calm him down first. When he's locked up, I have a good idea to finish him. Stop! Li, I know you're important. You won't be held for contempt of court. I just want to know. Did Menfa tell you Tan walked out from Yuan's house? You speak like a man. Menfa did tell Yuanxin He, the Chief Constable of the County Office. It's not difficult to prove. He's out of town on business. He'll be back in a few days. Detain all the suspects. - Wait till He's back. - Yes, sir. Li, please hold on for a few days. Everything will be fine when He is back. You'll cause He trouble if you refuse. Okay. I will listen to you. Court adjourned. Sir, the murderer is from the House of Five Venoms. He's practicing the Toad Style. People who practice this style will have a weak point on their body. You must swiftly make a coat of a thousand needles. You'll get the desired statement. What's the coat of a thousand needles? This is it. It's thousands of sharp needles. The body will be flooded by needles. No matter where his weak point is, the needle will break it. When it's broken, all the needles will stab his body. According to the law, this punishment-- You want to catch the murderer or obey the law? Okay, I'll hurry up with the coat. Open it. lnside. Li, you've suffered. I've brought over the meal for you. Please enjoy it. Brother Ma, what a friend you are. He is my good friend. I consider you my good friend, too. A civil servant is hard to trust. Li, I drink first to show my respect. Brother Ma. Never mind. You've got to be careful. Li, please. Sorry I can't stay long. It's okay. He's a good man. Serve him properly. Yes. Close the gate. The coat is being produced swiftly. It'll be ready for tomorrow's court session. Just one thing. He's very good at martial arts. No one could come close to him. Before his inner power is torn down, chains and locks are useless. How can we ask him to put it on? I have an idea. Sir, we may-- Mr. Li, Ma asked me to send you this. - Sorry to bother you. - Mr. Li, never mind. Please enjoy it. Though it's Ma's order, we can't do that in prison. FAlR AND JUSTlCE - Bring the suspect. - Yes, sir! Good idea. The coat can remove my inner power. Who knew this trick? What a mean idea! But my body has no weak point. You've wasted your time. It's Brother Snake. The coat must be your idea. You think my weak point is in the hand, but you'll never find out. Scorpion spearhead. The Scorpion is in the room. Who is it? Now I know where your weak point is. Put the coat on him. Sign and I'll let you go. He has fainted. Cuff him and lock him up with the heaviest chain. Court adjourned. Song's Law doesn't allow sentencing without a statement. What should we do? Sir, don't worry. Everybody saw Li's rebellious action in court. It's already a death sentence. We couldn't exclude the Yuan case. Let's accuse him of this. I think we've got to use this punishment again. His inner power was torn down. He can't take punishment anymore. We've used the coat of a thousand needles. What else should we use? - Should we use the Red Stomacher? - Yes, we should. - Bring him here. - Yes, sir. Li, confess, and you won't have to suffer. You bastard, I'm not saying anything. You can't keep me here forever. Li, you should understand the situation better. I understand it very much. He is coming back soon. - Bring witness Menfa and Tan. - Yes, sir. Menfa, you said you saw the murderer. Is it true? Y-Yes. The murderer is a man of about 20, strong and beardless. - Is he in the court? - Him. It's him. What about him? I didn't see him before. I've never met a man with a beard. Tan can go free now. The evidence is well established. Li is to be locked up and executed. Ask the murderer to sign. You may go now. You'll need to keep yourself available. Why do you have to be so fierce? Your weak point was broken. You should have thanked me. I'll save your head from being chopped off and keep your dead body complete. Hang him. Report it tomorrow morning, saying that he committed suicide. Okay. Go in. - All taken care of? - All done. Mr. Hong, how could you know? What do you think? Of course. The guys inside are from my group. No, we all belong to your group. Right, we're from the same group. I've heard constables like you know how to kill without leaving traces. This is called brain pin. The pin goes straight inside the head. You can't tell from outside. Menfa has gone earlier. He's been taken care of with a barb which slit his throat. Can these be compared to yours? All done. Shit. The rack stick in the hall hurt me a lot. I was tortured. The treasure map still hasn't been found. The efforts aren't justified. I'm afraid the matter isn't over yet. Those who deserve to die are gone. How could it not be over? The Toad is here. The Scorpion is our guy, no need to mention them. Brother Gecko must be somewhere around, but he hasn't shown up yet. Don't ask me. I've just met Brother Scorpion a few times. But what the hell was he doing during the day? No idea. That Brother Gecko. Maybe he's dead. I always feel that it's not over yet. What does Brother Scorpion do? Do you know? Who knows? Maybe he's the one who squeezed you. - Sir, I'm back. - You may leave. Sir, did Tan make his statement? None of your business. Leave. Yes, sir. Yuanxin, you're back. Take a couple of days off. Yuanxin, what's wrong? How's the Yuan case? Yuanxin, the case is over. Over? They tell me Tan was set free. Li was taken as the murderer. Is that what you mean by over? You tell me it's over? Yuanxin, Li made his statement saying that he's from the Five Venoms Clan. You should know the House is an evil organization. - Where are you going? - To see Li. Li committed suicide. You just met him recently. Why bother to get involved? Are you old friends? Though I just recently met him, we must be reasonable. Menfa did see Tan. Menfa revised his statement. - Where is Menfa? - He died suddenly. A neat job. Things happened after you left. Lin died suddenly, too. They were all murdered! The examiner did a thorough job on them. The bodies had no wounds or damage. Wounds can be covered up with money. Yuanxin, we've all done bad things. You're the only decent one. Menfa's body was just buried. You don't believe it? You may examine it again. No more trouble. A letter from home says that my mother is very sick. I'll resign soon. I'll ask the lord to promote you as the captain. Why bother to ruin your future over this trivial matter? Trivial matter. Trivial matter! Mr. He. Ah, Mr. He. All of you get out of here. I said leave me alone! Go, go, go. Mr. He, I have no choice. I didn't touch this 1 ,000 silver taels. - Who gave you this? - Guang Lin. How did Li die? Tissues soaked with water suffocated him. Bullshit! Li was a skillful boxer. That stupid method couldn't suffocate him. He suffered punishment in the court. His inner power was crushed. The tool was produced swiftly. I never saw it before. It's called the coat of a thousand needles. The coat of a thousand needles. How did the lord know it could crush his inner strength? I heard it was Hong's idea. When Lin came, the old constable was here, too. We were very drunk that night. The old constable hanged himself. He always said that being a civil servant, we don't drive out the rascals and protect the people, but the other way around. - Mr. He. - I've read the report. Lin and Menfa died suddenly with no wound or damage. It's true that there's no wound, but I know the causes of their death. What are they? Menfa was killed by a throat barb. Lin was killed by a brain pin. Mr. He, if someone spread my words, I'll surely be dead. You take this money and leave here immediately, the farther the better. Thanks, Mr. He. How can a gecko resist a scorpion, a snake, and a centipede? The Five Venoms are out, and the world is settled. Let's talk up there. - You're-- - How are you, fourth brother? I'm Yang De, the last student of the Master. Master had a last will before he died. Let's talk about this somewhere else. Tell me here. Explain to me, how do you know there was Scorpion, Snake, Centipede, and l? I was watching the fifth brother catching Brother Centipede. These last few days, I messed around with the petty officers, gambling and drinking. One day in the hall, I heard him call Hong the Snake. The Toad power of fifth senior wasn't crushed by the coat, but the Scorpion spearhead. Then the Scorpion was there. Apart from the Snake, Scorpion, and Centipede, there's Gecko as well. Say, if you weren't the fourth senior, would you investigate the matter of the fifth senior seriously? Master's last will was to ask me-- Yuanxin He has been back for a few days. He hasn't made trouble, so he's not the Gecko. You worry about this today and that tomorrow. I think you're wasting your time. The matter is over. You're still mumbling all the time. The Scorpion and you are like old folks. The Centipede is useless. He's worried he will be in trouble. You want to-- He's our eldest senior, after all. So what? Don't you mean the Toad isn't our schoolmate? Who the hell are you? Maybe I don't know. Maybe I know. But I won't ask this. We only kill people and do bad things. When should we stop? Starting with the Toad and then the Centipede. Will I be the next one? Maybe we should find the Gecko first. You don't have to worry about this. You have found him. . . or have you already joined him? Hence you don't need the Centipede's or my help. If you're so suspicious, I have nothing to say. I'm the wealthy son of an influential family. I don't really care about Uncle's treasure. It was just the fighting skills I was after. I entered the House by mistake. I've been controlled by you. I do more and more bad things. I kill more and more people. Once Brother Toad was dead, I realized how ruthless I had become. But I have to kill to keep mouths sealed. I had to kill Menfa and Lin. You ask me when we can stop. I might as well tell you now. You will keep doing bad things. Once you start, there's no end-- forever and ever. This is the training ground of the Gecko? You're the last student of Master. - I think you've learned my skills. - Yes, I did. Master said that I am not powerful enough. What I acquired is no match for any of you. But if I team up with one of you, I can defeat the others. I got it. But I don't know who the Scorpion is. Our enemy is hidden. Did Brother Gecko find any clue? No. lndeed, the Scorpion is still in town. The treasure that Uncle kept is probably in Scorpion's hands. It wasn't in his house. There's probably a map showing the hiding spot. If Scorpion has the map, he'll definitely go to the spot. Though Scorpion will leave town, there are many people here. One less or one more. How can we figure it out? Right. Leave it alone. Let's practice first. Master said the eldest senior has fast hands. His nickname is the Thousand Hands. I hope to tackle him with Gecko, who should attack from above to below. I will attack the lower part of his body. It'll work this way. Above! Below! Master also said the Snake is very quick in response. The right hand is the head, and the left hand the tail. They'll protect each other. I'll attack him with Gecko from both sides. It may break his defense system. - The right. - The left. Master said the third senior-- I've been waiting for you for days. I knew you'd come. You want to stop me. I know your temper well. I'm here to give you a hand. Ma, you're going to your motherland. You don't have to get involved. Stop saying that if you consider me your friend. Ma, I'm not looking down on you. When we start fighting, it'll be very hard for you to step in. Though I can't step in, I'll protect you from the attack of Hong's servants. Is that okay? Hey. Ma, have you changed? I've resigned from my post. Right. I'm not doing this anymore. I didn't expect three people coming. Where's Tan? I'm right here. Tan, you're the Thousand Hands. Wentong Hong, you're the Snake. Stop pretending. You are the Gecko. You should have known earlier. You're still looking on with arms folded. A private matter isn't a civil servant's duty. Who are you? You can't fool me. Why don't you start? The Scorpion? When did you know? When you stroked the spearhead. . . in the hall. . . and crushed Toad's inner power. Unbelievable. I just realized it recently. You knew it. You wanted to use me to kill the eldest and Snake. - Isn't it obvious? - I see. Is the treasure already in your hands? What do you think? Thousand Hands, you better make it clear we still have grounds for discussion. But you too have risked your life for them. He's our little junior. He has Master's orders to clean up the dirt. Finish the two of them, and I'll share the treasure with you. Separate them. Where's the treasure? Tell me! Move! Come on! The governor also took part in killing the fifth brother. Birds of a feather. Killing the governor is useless. Another corrupt man will replace him. How could we eradicate all of them? Let's complete Master's last will, use the treasure for charity, and absolve Five Venoms House of its bad reputation. There's no more Five Venoms Clan. You're right.
