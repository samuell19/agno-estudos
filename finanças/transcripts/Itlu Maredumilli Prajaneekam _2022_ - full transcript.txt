Hey, Come on. Come on. Let's go. Bring him. Nothing will happen to you Nothing will happen to you. You will be fine. Don't worry. God will protect you. Let's go... fast. Move... Be careful Move fast... We were born and brought up here in the forest This is not new to us. Nothing will happen to us Don't worry. Let's go.. move Move all of you.. move. Come fast.. -Let's go. Here... What happened? The water flow is heavy. Let's go the other way. He's struggling, elder. This is not something new for us. It's all God's grace. Let's go Let's go. -Let's go. Let's go. Come fast... come.... Appanna, nothing will happen to you Be strong -Come fast. He slipped down when he was trying to extract honey from a comb on the tree, Sir. He got struck by a branch. How long has it been since he got injured? It's been around 5-6 hours. Why are you here so late when he is losing so much blood? I wonder what kind of people you are. What can we do, Sir? We need to get down the hill. We need to carry him with us. To cross the stream we don't even have a bridge. We are here late because we came here through the forest. I would have saved him if you brought him here two hours ago. I'm sorry! Take him back Appanna! Appanna! Appanna! Appanna! What sin did we commit, Elder? We'll die if we get any disease. We'll die if we get into an accident. Oh God! The distance doesn't seem to reduce no matter how fast we run carrying the person. We requested several times to construct a bridge. But everyone ignored us. Why do we have to go through this punishment, Elder? Kanda... Even if it belongs to the same body, everyone looks down on the left hand. We are humans too. But we belong to the hills. So, everyone looks down on our lives. Oh no! Appanna! With the death of Ramanaidu, who won four times as the undisputed leader in Rampachodavaram Constituency, the winning equations have changed. This time both the main parties are equally likely to win. Mr. Peddireddi Nagireddy has just arrived. Let's hear what he says in his own words. Vote for me who has been doing public service for 30 years, under the guidance of MR. Ramanaidu. I will fulfill all your needs. I will built a ring road around the town, flyovers, and footbridges all over the town. I will make our town look like Singapore in 5 years. Tell me, do you want to live in Singapore? Yes. Yes. Will you vote for me? We will. We will. Will you send me to the assembly? We will. We will. Will you make our party win? We will. We will. Hi! Here... - Hello! Hi! I am Srinivas Sripada -Yeah, I know. I'll come directly to the point. My dad likes your alliance. But I have a condition to step forward with this wedding. You have an offer My first elder sister is settled in the US My second elder sister is settled in the UK My brother is settled in Australia My cousins settled in Malaysia. Our family has a name that everyone settles in abroad. There's a lot of demand for Telugu teachers in the US. If you come with me there, I'm fine with it. Tell them that you are doing a software job if someone asks you. If you tell them that you are a Telugu teacher, it looks cheap. It looks cheap? I did MA Ph.D. in Telugu not because I didn't get any good score or rank. I did it because I love Telugu so much. I might've come to the US if you called me to teach Telugu there. But if you are embarrassed to say it out, No. Bye. Are you fine with a Telugu teacher paying the bill? "A new day is calling you with the shine early in the morning." "Wake up and embrace it with your heart." "There is no person who's not your own." "Help others like a friend." "Here, you are not only yourself, but the people around you." "Every heart is yours." "Can't you hear your name in the beat?" "If one crow gets injured, a hundred crows come to help." "Don't be alone just by yourself." "If you see a person who's alone, go to them and befriend them." "Gold never makes the sound that brass makes." "No one makes a temple bell with gold." "A light doesn't show darkness in its presence." "Don't ever deceive yourself." "Education is said to be the greatest gift." "We are the people who sell and survive on it..." "Try to educate the people around you as much as you can." "And there will be no teacher greater than you." "You are the people. And you are the world. " "What more can even Bhagavadgita tell you?" Sir, one cup of tea and a pack of biscuits for a person. Hello. Do you know who I am? I'm Bokka Paramesh. I did a double MA in English. Even if you do a triple MA, you will only get one cup of tea and a pack of biscuits. Listen... You guys will never develop. That's why India still a poor nation. Look at the total number of votes in the village. If everyone votes, we will achieve hundred percent. Okay, sir. I'll take a look at them. Hi! Hi! -Hi! Don't mind me asking. Why are you taking notes? What will the DRO say? Now, we will sit in the polling booth. We'll take a look at the list. We'll ink their fingers and send them away Training for this and you are noting down something on that? And moreover you teaching him? This is my third time training. I already did duties in the past two elections. Oh! Won't you get bored studying the same thing three different times? What is your major, by the way? - I'm Srinivas Sripada. I'm a Telugu teacher. Telugu? -Yes. Then that means you are not yet married, right? I'm not. I know. Do you know who I am? I did a double MA. A salary of one lakh rupees I teach English complicatedly in my class. They'll come to my tuition if they don't understand my classes. If they don't come to me, I'll make sure they fail in that subject. The tuition fees they pay me, I'll give the same amount to their parents on interest. So finally, I get two salaries. And along with that, after retiring I get settlement benefits. I earn in many ways. But no girl until now agreed to marry me You are a Telugu teacher after all. Why would they agree to marry you? I rejected a girl yesterday. We should say that, Sir. We should never speak low of ourselves. If they reject us, many doubts will arise about our masculinity No, it was me who... By the way, Sir, I heard that these political parties will throw parties during the election duties, it seems. If a guy offers chicken biryani, another will offer mutton biryani. If a guy offers Pepsi, the other guy will offer coke it seems. If they know that you took them, they'll suspend you. Our duty is to conduct a fair election. It's our responsibility. You did a MA in English, right? -Yes. Can I ask you a question? You can ask me two. I did a double MA. What is the meaning of Sir? Sir means .Sir. Hello, Sir Greetings, Sir. Sir Well it's Mister in Telugu The abbreviation of sir is "Slave I Remain". Earlier, you were saying that you are still my slave. Why should you live like a slave? Please write down your notes. -Snacks are ready sir. Snacks are ready, it seems, I'm going. All these are tribal villages. Until the last election, the polling booths were arranged down the hill. But these people don't have the habit of coming to vote by spending 4-5 hours of their time. Because they are illiterates who do not know the value of their vote. Most of these villagers have never executed their vote in their life. The voting percentage is not more than three percent. Our district collector, Mr. Arjun Trivedi gave orders to make sure that there should be 100 percent voting. So, every vote of theirs is important to us. That's why, this time, we arranged the polling booths in their respective villages. Our presiding officers reach the villages four days in advance... and create awareness among them to make sure that we get 100 percent voting. Assistant presiding officers will follow them. The remaining people will join at the time of election polling. Okay? Telugu is a second language in the school. But here, Telugu people are sitting in the front seats. And English ones are sitting at the back. No wonder that this country is going to dogs What's this, Sir? I mean, what's this Master? Why should we beg these uneducated fellows to cast their... vote like how people ask for donations to organize public fairs for festivals? Is this what I did double MA for? If I think about it I feel hungry. Damn, I feel sad. Of course I feel hungry too. Is there anything to eat? Oh my ghosh! You said we'll go to some village. What is this forest? Jeeps can't enter the village. Goodness. What should we do now? They told me that VRO's assistant would come to pick you up. He'll come and pick us up? Why don't you take us? -Why would I go to that village? Hey! Hey, Lovaraju! Send me half dozen of these to my home. They told me to come by 8. I'm 20 minutes late. I wonder how they'll react. I'm sorry for being late. Shall we go ahead, Sir? It's okay. Hi, Bro. What's with the Bro? I'm Bokka Paramesh double MA. Then it's MAMA. - MAMA? MA, MA is MAMA. You did double MA, right? Do you know who I am? I'm the assistant to the VRO. You are his assistant. We both are the same. I'm still don't know where the country is going. What's your name? -Mister Babu. What kind of name is that? All the elders in my village used to call my dad Hey and You. With that anger, my dad named me Mister Babu and my brother Mister. Now, if someone wants to call me, they definitely should give me respect. Right? You are forcibly seeking respect. -Yes Bro. Nice. Where's the village? It's over there, Sir. Thank god! Where is it? - Over there, Bro. There's a Bael tree. It's right behind that. There are trees everywhere over there. Oh shit! Don't you know about Bael tree, when you studied double MA? Of course, I know. It's behind that tree. Right? Come on. Just a minute... hold this I'll show you the village. Get your luggage. Wow! Beautiful English I know. Get that Electronic Voting Machine. It's the government's property. I'm getting this since you said that it belongs to the government. Thank you. -No mention. As I live here, I walk a little fast. Please don't mind me. Hey! It's been an hour since we started. Where's the village? It's over there, Bro. It's right behind the Bael tree. Oh my goodness. Who planted that there? -It's definitely not me! Please come, Sir. How are you able to figure out the way in this deep forest? We come here regularly, so we know. If someone new comes here. They are done for. They can never know which side is the village, or which side is the forest. How do people living here survive? We are habituated here, Bro. In the time you climb up this hill once, they do it twice. By the way, Sir, I heard that you are very strict while teaching. Mr.VRO told me that you would hang a board saying "Do not disturb" while you teach. What? You'll hang a board saying "Do not disturb"? That too for a Telugu class? Are you familiar with the rhyme, "Rain rain, go away."? Of course. What kind of question is this? Rain rain, go away. Come again another day. Little Johnny wants to play. Rain rain, go away. I beg you, please stop it there, Bro. For the same rhyme, do you know the Telugu version? In Telugu? Do you mean dubbing it? I can do that. Rain rain, go away. Come again some other time. Little Johnny will play -Master... Rain should fall, God of the ocean. The crops should be grown well, God of the ocean. The pond in our village should be full, God of the ocean. We'll make sure to hold a grand wedding for the frogs, God of the ocean. Please make sure that all the crops in the fields are green. I'm not against any language. I'm not criticizing. In the English rhyme, I'm saying that the rain should go away today as I'm not comfortable. Meanwhile, in Telugu, we are wishing that the ponds should be full, the crops should be grown well, and we are wishing for everyone's welfare in society. Society means it's not only me. We all together make a society. I don't like it if someone disturbs me when I'm planting the seeds of goodness in the minds of kids. That's the reason behind me hanging that board. I'm not sure if I can say this after hearing that. I guess you are not aware but you used 6 English words. I used them so that you can get me well. It's not like we have no words in Telugu. The Telugu writing system has 56 letters. But the English writing system just has 26 letters, so English is always a small language when compared to Telugu. That was really great, Sir. What's great? -Come on. We are getting late. What Bro? Come... We need to walk fast. If the sun sets, wild animals will come out. I'm an inhabitant here. So they won't come to me. But if they smell you, they'll definitely eat you up, Bro. You did a double MA. Yes. You are an idiot! Who are they? Well, Kanda. We have elections on the 25th. They are setting up a booth here, it seems. Booth? These officers will teach you how to cast your vote and will leave after the election process is finished. Mr.VRO sent me to tell the Elder about them so that they can make their arrangements. No one will cast their votes here. You can go. Kanda, well Go... No Elections.. no arrangements Obstructing the duty of a public officer is an offense under the law. If you guys have any problem please share it with us, and we can discuss it. Problems? We need a school in our village. And there should be a teacher in it. We need a hospital for our village. And we need to have a doctor. You saw a stream on your way, right? We need a bridge to cross it. We've been requesting these for the past 20 years. We visited your offices several times regarding this matter. Our legs don't have the strength anymore to come and ask again. Never once your officers cared to look at us. Now you dared to come and ask us for votes? Do you think we will vote? Never! If anyone tries to cast their vote... We'll kill them. Kanda! Please forgive him, Sir. What he did was a mistake. But what he said is correct. I'm saying the same as the elder of this village. No one will participate in the election. But, Sir. You don't have to go back. You can go ahead and make your preparations. We won't help you. Kanda! Inform everyone in the village. No one should participate in the election. Sure, Elder. Ithiri! (Beware) What's this, Master? Do they think that we enjoy carrying these heavy weights and climbing up the hills? We are doing all this for them. -Let's go, Master. Let's go and inform our higher officers about this. Damn. These people don't have to vote. It's their wish to cast their votes or not. It's our duty to conduct the election to get 100% votes. 100% voting? My goodness. What about the five star accommodation that was allotted for us... to stay until the election finishes by the government? This is the five-star hotel that the government provided you. This one? -Yes. You... Anyway, search if someone can come with a broom to clean all this if we pay them. They'll bring their knives. Master! We should do it ourselves. -Come on.. do it. Goodness! I didn't even do this at home -that's why, clean up here. Does Spider-Man used to stay here? (Song humming) What Bro? Do you want some jasmine flowers to spread on your bed? Stop your satirical talks and take care of the dinner. Excuse me, double MA. I know a place, let's go there. Don't tell me that we should get down the hill to eat. Then let's go and get the food from down the hill and eat it here. You are super! Thank you. Go and get it then. No need for all those. The food is ready. "Master, Master will serve us dinner." This is what dinner is... What!? When I first got to know that I'm going to a tribal village, I expected chicken and mutton and assumed that it would be a five-day food festival. This is what we are left with in the end. There's no force, Master. -My inners are screaming! Open it. (Song humming) You got freshened up already, Bro? I'm freshening up now. Are you using a deodorant? I can't be here, Master. Let's take care of those 248 votes and leave. If there's any need let's come back after the elections. I can't do this anymore. Sir, you can't find those 248 voters in one place. Why? The village in which we are currently in has around 35 households. That means, there are around 70 voters. What about the rest? If we go ahead a little, we can find some 30 voters. If we climb up a little more we can find another 20 voters. I guess there are some voters above the hill. According to Mr. VRO's count there are around 12 villages. This is cheating, Master. With just one TA and DA they are making us work in 12 villages? This is not fair and not lovely also. Come on, let's go. Sir, even I myself don't know the proper way. Even if there's some notice or if we want to call someone, we just say or give it to the Elder of the village. They share the information among themselves. It's nice. Okay, let's go and search for them. That means we should beg everyone. Goodness gracious. Hey! Where are we going, man? We are going to the village, bro. How do you know that it's this way? What do you mean? What are you talking, bro? We just have to follow the path in which others paved. The path which others paved? People walked in this way to go to the temple, not to the village. How should we go from here? Sir, the directions are here. Which one leads us to which way? I'm not sure, Sir. We need to try out our luck. I'll tell you. I'll tell you which way leads us to the village. How? After hitting that parrot, we need to go in the way that parrot falls. Bro, No! Don't touch that parrot! Bro! Oh no! I just missed it. What's this, bro? Why don't you listen? Why did you hit it? Why are you tense? Some kids might've tied it while playing in the trees. I became a kid after seeing that. I played a lot in my childhood, you know. If they get to know that you hit the parrot, they'll kill us. Why do they kill us if we hit a parrot? Don't try to scare me Let's throw it away and go from here. Sir, she's Kanda's younger sister Kanaka Lakshmi. What's that? It's my stomach. It's been coming out lately. Are you able to see it? Why are you hiding it? No... nothing... Are these the ones who opposed my elder brother? Well, the elections are scheduled. The officers Will they hit the parrot if they come here to conduct the elections? You saw it already? -Of course. Well, some kids might've tied it while playing in the trees. Kids didn't tie them there. The girls in our village tied them. The girls? Then? Our village girls offerings for a vow for the Goddess after reaching puberty for their future husbands. An offering for a vow? Do you know who should make it fall from the tree? Who? The one who married the girl. What if someone make it fall in advance? The guy who made it will have to marry her. Me? No way. What? No way? I'll tell Kanda what you did. Bro, bro. Marriage is better than that. Stop it. Just a small hope in my poor life. Excuse me, ma'am. The girl who tied this offering vow, will she look cute at least like you? She won't. She's my one and only enemy in this village. She looks like a good black-goat. She's so strong. Darn it! But they say that Thalupulu can cook better than me. I don't like that. Thalupulu? Subtitles please. Which doors, ma'am? It's her name. Her name is Door and her color is black. What's this, master? I came for the election duty for a TA, DA. Will you get me killed by a black goat? Congrats, bro. Your marriage is set! Get lost! Look! We are teachers in a school. We came here for election duty. Why would we hit them if we knew that they were offering vows? Why are you looking at us like that? You are a school teacher? Yes. I'm a teacher, too. What? You are a teacher? I'm a teacher, too. Which subject do you teach? I teach all subjects. You teach all the subjects? What's your qualification? Was it BA, MA, BED or MED? I passed my 7th grade. You are a teacher and just studied till 7 th grade. How can we know about the beliefs of this village? If you don't want any more mistakes to happen from our side, you should help us. This village will get benefits if the elections are held. Teachers should help each other. I'll show you the way. What if Elder gets know ? They'll just abandon me in the dark room for a month. A dark room? They'll give me food once a day. I need to stay in the dark until the new moon. What grave mistake did you make? A village should stand on one word. Everyone should follow the elder's orders here. Then don't. You'll face problems. It's completely fine. We can stay in the dark room even for a year if something good happens to this village. But if the villagers know that you made that offering fall from the tree Why am I in this tension, sir? Please let me go, I'll leave. Hey! They'll drag you here no matter where you go. They'll drag me? Do they have the guts? I'm sure they are capable. What should I do now, 7th passed teacher? Tie up the offering and follow me. Let's go. -Me? Master! I think you believe in god, right? I believe. Veerabadra in the village and Goddess Konalamma on the outside of the village. Who is Veerabadra? The god's ox. Who's he? He's the God of our village. Every full moon, he will come to our temple with the cattle and bless all of us. He's the one who guards the village. What do you mean by that? Give me the subtitles please. He's their saviour it seems, master. Veerabadra! Sit down, sit down. Veerabadra's cattle are going. The superstitions are at their peaks sir. Mr.Bokka! This is not a superstition. It's like how we greet our boss who pays us the salaries. We greet the cow which gives us milk and the harvest which fills our stomach. Sit down, sit down. Please sit down. -Okay. Okay. Look over there. The one you see there is the village. Then you can stop here. Why? It's fine if you take the punishment after making a mistake. But you shouldn't face trouble after helping. Everyone who has the right to vote listen to me carefully. Elections will be held in your village in 4 days. If you take the booth-slips now, we'll teach you how to vote in the machine. We won't execute our vote. We only follow the elder's orders. Okay, don't come to vote. Take these booth-slips. We don't know about them. We will not take them. Don't take these. I'll read out the names from the voter's list. Will you raise your hands? Lift up your hands. It's not like you vote if you just raise your hand. Will they be able to leave the village if they try to pull anything? Read out the names, sir. Beeramma. -Yes I am sir. Narappa. -Yes I amLakshmi. It's not Lakshmi sir, it's Lachchimi. Lachchimi. Goodness! They do not even understand if we pronounce the names correctly. Why do they need to vote? sir, If we don't know how to use our tongue properly we'll make our own enemies. Subtitles, please. If you don't stop running your itchy mouth, she's saying that she'll tell Kanda about you. Did she say the same thing again? Appanna. Appanna. Come on, sir. To where? Come on, sir. He is Appanna. He passed away. He might have made it alive if there was a bridge. He was the only breadwinner of the family. He passed away. I'm an old man. I can't work. She's pregnant. She should not work. If the kid has to eat something at the very least, we need to beg in the village. We requested for a bridge from many officers but everyone ignored us! If my baby asks me where my father is after taking birth, should I tell the baby that his father died because there was no bridge? Or should I tell him that the officers in the town have killed him? If we vote for you, will he come back alive, sir? Please leave, sir! Leave. Come this way, sir. Come from this way sir.. -Which way? Master. I know exactly what you feel in your heart. You want to leave these elections and leave, right? I have the same feeling. No, master. Our lives are different 25 kilometers from here. If we just have a mobile with us, we can get everything at our doorstep starting from schools to the hospitals. From super markets to the medical stores. We have 100 options to choose in which we want our kids to get educated. At least there is no primary school here. We have 100 super specialty hospitals if we get sick. But there are no basic needs here. Only after traveling 25kms inside this forest did we realise their state of life. I don't know if I should feel sorry for them or pity them. Sir, come on, come on. If it gets dark, the tiger will come. Please come, sir. Come on, bro. How to cross this? What's this bro? I only studied till 10th grade. You did a double MA. Can't you cross this? How are this physical harassment and my educational qualification related? Carry me. Carry you? Hold my hand. Please hold my hand sir. Come on. Crossing the stream is very difficult, bro. Where did they go? Why that whistle? That is their language, sir. They stay far from each other. They talk with these whistles. They may not know about WhatsApp What happened? The elephants are attacking it seems. For what? Recently some people started to take tourists here on forest tours and were lurking here in jeeps. Those idiots are consuming alcohol and are just dumping those glass bottles in the forest. The elephants are huge, so as soon as they step on them... the glass bottles are breaking and hurting the elephants. Since the elephants don't know where to go, they are coming on to the villages in pain. You might get angry if I ask you. The people in the town have education, but they don't have a brain. Anyway, my home is just beside here. You can sleep there. Tomorrow the people of 5 villages get their products and gather in a market place. You can do your duty there. Come on. -Let's go, sir. Hey! I'll bring the fire, you prepare the wood for the fireplace. Where is it? Oh, you have a torch? Please show it here once. Here Come on, let's get warm. -Here, here. We both should get warm? Please show it here. I got it. If only I could get some alcohol at this time I would get rid of my body pains. Damn. Bro. Do you want to drink daddy? What do you mean by Dad and Mom? There will be a tall black tree. They tie earthen pots at the tip. Pot? Yes! That's not daddy, its toddy. Do you care about the name or daddy? I want to get intoxicated. Let's go. Okay. Let's go. I will take you. (Humming song) Where are you going? -We'll come back soon. We have to go to the market early in the morning. Don't forget that. Sure, sure. Come on, bro. By the way, you are a clever girl. Why did you only study till 7th grade? How will that be possible, sir? It takes 10 hours to go down the hill and come back home. My father took me to the school when he was alive in my childhood. When my father took me, everyone looked at us surprised. I asked him why he was taking me to the school. Educated people stay in the towns, dear. The uneducated people stand in a queue in front of them there. We sell our products to Mr. Devudu, he is an educated person too. Some officers take our products and give us money. They are educated too. They don't even listen to us if we stand in the queue there for several hours. If you get educated too, you can become great like them. You know the struggling of people who stand in the line. You will work hard, dear. That's why I am making you study. My father said that and passed away. and my studies stopped there. You have so much pain inside. How can you be so cheerful and smiling on the outside? I will not forget the past. And I don't recall it every day. We have to go to the market early in the morning, and sleep now. Okay. "Are you a new alphabet in my language Telugu?" "Are you a new line on my palm?" "Are you the moon that's hidden in the soil?" "Did you take my little heart with you?" "Hey, Lachchimi! I'll follow you, Kanakalachchimi." "It's because we are destined." "Now, don't hesitate and talk with your heart." "Hey, Lachchimi! I'll follow you, Kanakalachchimi." "It's because we are destined." "Now, don't hesitate and talk with your heart." Move aside, move aside. Greetings, everyone. Please listen to me carefully. Everyone should come tomorrow and execute your right to vote. Mister! Why can't you understand when we tell you once? If we tell Kanda that you are coming after us and forcing us to vote, Oh Mister! Please don't take any violent decisions right now. Let's sit and discuss in a friendly manner. The tamarind looks so fresh. How much? 200 grams of Tamarind costs 2.25 or 2.5 rupees. A kilogram for 15 INR? It's less than that. They are buying here at cheap rates... and are selling at very high rates down the hill in the name of organic products. This is a scam, sir. It's a bloody scam. "The beauty of the River Godavari lost its way and came to me." "I feel elated talking to this flower." "Oh my, are those just words or Mr.Ilayaraja's song?" "Why do you make my heart beat like a Tabla like Zakir Hussain?" "Hey, Lachchimi! I'll follow you, Kanakalachchimi." "It's because we are destined." "Now, don't hesitate and talk with your heart." "Hey, Lachchimi! I'll follow you, Kanakalachchimi." "It's because we are destined." "Now, don't hesitate and talk with your heart." "The honeycomb made a guitar play in my heart." "If you are annoyed the anger can even fire the crackers." "Oh my, your expressions are much cuter than Kuchipudi dance!" "The way you walk just resembles a peacock's dance." "Hey, Lachchimi! I'll follow you, Kanakalachchimi." "It's because we are destined." "Now, don't hesitate and talk with your heart." "Hey, Lachchimi! I'll follow you, Kanakalachchimi." "It's because we are destined." "Now, don't hesitate and talk with your heart." We decided not to help them. Why did you go with them? They are the government officers; I thought they would help us, if they know about the problems in our village. They won't! They'll understand our problems only if they are humans. How can those officers understand? We are asking them for the past 30 years. Who helped us? If there's anyone that help us, that's only Mr. God or Veerabadra. Listen to me, Elder. Follow my words or stay in the dark room. What are you saying? You are going against the elder who raised you since childhood? My grandfather used to say that British divided our country. Now you guys are driving wedges between our families. Hey! My axe knows to cut trees. It knows the taste of blood too. Let's go. It's enough, sir. It's enough. Even if you want to stay, I can't. We can search for another job. But if we lose our life we can't get it back. No, Master. Listen to me. If we go after our duty like that, we end up dying. Do you realize that? He's right, sir. Let's go back. Come on, let's take her quickly. Please bear it, dear. Please take her quick. Move.. let's go... Master... Master... It's our karma. Be careful. Be careful. Ma'am! Please come outside. Please look at this woman. -Move aside. Move aside. You'll be fine, dear. You'll be fine, dear. Please bear it, dear. You'll be fine. Is she Okay? It's hard, elder. The amniotic fluid is leaking. We can't save her unless we go to a hospital. I don't think she can make it alive until we reach the hospital. She's struggling. Do something and save her. What can we do? What do we have here to do something? Your officers never cared to look into our problems. Now you are telling us to do something. Elder, please forget about the anger you have on the officers. Please listen to me, once. The deliveries used to be hard back then when there were no hospitals. They used to deliver the babies in the rivers. The fast-flowing river water will help in pushing the baby out of the womb. The delivery will be done. I told you not to be in our village. Why are you interfering in the matters of our village again? Kanda! -Get lost!Listen to me. We'll take care of our problems ourselves. You go. I'll try. Elder, please trust me. Yes, Elder. What he said is right. My mother told me that my Great-grandmother had done such deliveries. Let's keep our trust in him, elder. Let's try it. Please agree to it, elder. Please bear it, dear. Don't worry. We are all here for you. Polamma, Listen to me carefully Take a deep breath and push it hard. Come on, push it. Your husband Appanna will take birth in your house again. You will be fine -Push it, come on. Push it. I can't Don't say. Only a woman can give birth to life. Push it. Come on... Please push it, Bear it. No! Don't close your eyes. Look, look! -Get up! You have endured hunger. You have endured when Appanna passed away leaving you alone. This pain is nothing when compared to that. Get up! Please hold her legs. Don't close your eyes. Don't close your eyes. JAI Veerabhadra! Don't close your eyes. -Open your eyes. Veerabadra is here. You will be fine. See... see... Hail Veerabadra! Hail Veerabadra! (Slogans...) Hail Veerabadra! (Slogans continue...) Hail Veerabadra! (Slogans continue...) Push it a little more. Just a little more. Push it, dear! Try it, dear! Push it, dear! Hail Veerabadra! (Slogans continue...) Sir. Like you said Appanna took birth again. We have seen officers who ignored us when we were dying. We have seen people who didn't understand us when there's a corpse passing by. But a person who's not related to you is suffering from pain. You were worried seeing that. It's been a long time since we saw a person like you. Please forgive us, sir. Please. We'll do what you say. We'll vote in the elections. We'll cast the vote. Until now only I believed in you. And now, the whole village believes in you. I'm glad, sir. I'm Sripada Srinivas. I'm a Telugu teacher. I survive on my salary. I don't tutor any kids. I have a small house, mother and father. This is my family. You might have a small problem with me. If someone in front of me is having any problem I can't stay still. There have been several incidents where my life was in danger trying to help others. But I don't have any intention to change myself. If I want to be myself, I want a girl who's like me. That's you, Lakshmi. Even though the Elder ordered not to help us, you still did. I understood that then. Will you marry me ? My father passed away when I was in 7th grade. Even my mother passed away after a few days. Elder stood up as my father. This village took care of me like my mother. If I have to marry you, I will have to leave this village. I can be happy. But the problems in this village won't go away. When our people are going through struggles, how can I wish for my own happiness, sir? If you bring the booth slips our people gave you, you can come and vote. To help you, more officers and 2 policemen will come here by tomorrow evening. Last time when we went to vote along with the Elder, they gave us 20 bucks. What are you going to give us? A vote is a free right given to you by the constitution. What do you mean by free? What will we gain by voting for free? We can earn some money if we sell it. If you all vote, you will have an MLA. If you tell him your problems he will solve them. If you tell us who the right candidate is, we'll vote for them. We can't take sides. That's wrong. If you want I can tell you about the assurances the candidates gave. You can decide on whom you want to vote for by sitting and discussing with the Elder. Sure sir. We always agree with the Elder. Okay. Take a leave, sir. Greetings. Ask Elder about the 20 bucks. This country is not going... It is gone. What Master? What are you thinking about so deeply? Poor them. They believed us just because we saved a life and are voting. But we never know what the MLA who wins will do. They don't even know that these people exist. Why would they look at them after they win? Then what will these people gain by voting for them, master? Master, you are over thinking. What do we have to do here? We have to make sure the voting percent is 100. If we make sure that happens, the government will give us an award. I'll take that award and display it in my home and brag about it. And I will increase the fees of my tuition. It's a screenplay of our system, sir. Sorry sir Bro, why are you roaming like that? Hasn't anyone come here yet? Of course, they came. Here, take these and let them vote. Take these 2 along with you. Who came? There's not even an insect here. Look, Lakshmi is coming. Come madam come... What is this? We asked them so much, but no one came to vote. Did you blow the conch shell? What do you mean by blowing a conch shell? Just like how school kids need a bell, they need to hear the sound when a conch shell is blown to come here. Generally, we blow a conch shell when someone passes away. I don't know. You know nothing. I don't know where Indian police are going! Where did you keep that conch shell? Since it's the god's, I placed it with the god's photos and lighted an incense stick. Lit up, lit up the whole forest. Bloody superstitions. Go and get it. Bro, look there. Come on, come on. Come to vote. Come on, you can do it, come on. What is your name? -Thalupulu. I think I heard it somewhere. Your fiancé. You hit the parrot earlier. You look like my own elder sister. Please go. Go and put your fingerprint there and get your finger inked there. We all are going to vote, Kanda. Let's go. Master, 99.5% voting is done. Kanda won't come to execute that one vote. Let's go. Our purpose is served. We need to wait until the times up. Let's wait. Should we wait? Will you go against the elder? Why are we waiting for just one vote? A vote is not a simple vote, it represents a person. Why did you get so emotional so suddenly? Right? Kanda! Bro, Kanda is here. -Welcome Kanda! Voter card. Go and put your fingerprint. Go inside and you'll see a mission go and cast your vote there. Success! 100 % voting -Super, bro! Congratulations sir. We did it. -Thank you, sir! Sir, it's all your hard work. congratulations -Thank you. What? Give it to him, Master It's heavy. I won't. I should get the award. For my sincerity, hard work and dedication. I'll not share it with anyone. No, I cannot. Okay, let's go. -Let's go. Elder. Please forgive us if something happened because of us. God bless you. You know how it is here. Please get started now. It'll be hard for you if it gets dark. Please go ahead. Take a leave, Elder. -Good Sir. Bye! Logging out from villagers Be careful Come sir. Come this way. Come sir. Master! Take care master. It's ok sir. What's wrong, sir? It's nothing. -Let's go. Hey! Step back! Step back! Are you Okay? Nothing to worry about. -Sir, who are they? Please come. Madam! Please give me that torch Are you hearing me? Sir, I am here. Sir! Come to me, all of you. Sir! Wait. -coming sir. Here... Are you listening to me Come carefully Here... here... Wait, wait. Everyone wait here. Is everyone here? -Sir, everyone is here, right? Sir! Where is Mr. Srinivas? Mr. Paramesh is also missing. Sir! Sir! Where are you Sir? Sir! Mr. Srinivas! Mr. Srinivas! Sir! Sir! Where? Sir! Where are you? This way, this way. Sir! Hey! Who are you guys? Kanda! Please listen to me. Hey! Sir! I'll kill you if you talk. Hey! Why are you doing this? What do you want? -Justice. We need a school in our village. A teacher should be in it. A hospital should be in the village. We need a doctor in it. We need a bridge to cross the stream. And we need a well-lighted way from down the hill. Request all those to the government officers down the hill. We are requesting them from the past 30 years. No office came here. These people came now. They asked us to vote and we did. If we leave them now, who's going to come here again? No one will come. You all think lowly of your Maredumilli villagers. You can take them with you after giving us what we want. If anyone steps forward ignoring us... we'll not hesitate to kill. Ithiri! What were you doing when they were attacking? Don't you guys have any guns loaded with bullets? Sir, we could not take any action as our men would be in danger. Do you know what'll happen if this news gets out? There will be political turmoil. The whole state is looking forward to the results of this election. Sir, there have been no complaints from the villagers until now. All this is being done by those 10 members. If we get a hold of them, the issue will be closed. Let's carry out a secret operation. Counting of votes will start in 5 days Before that, we need to get the ballot box and officers here. Do you understand? I'll stay here until the counting finishes. What will you say? Elder, please listen to me. What will you tell me? What will you tell me? Please listen to me. -What will you tell me? Are you going to say that you almost killed 300 people? What will you tell me? What will you tell me? I'll tell you. I'm the one who told them to carry out this abduction. What are you saying sir? Yes, Elder. I know that there's no use because of these elections. I know that you can gain nothing from me. But all of you voted for my sake. The government officers know that they need to consider the votes of the people living in the hills. But why do they know nothing about the struggles everyone living here is going through? Do they think that we won't question them? Are they being careless that we will not turn against them? This one question disturbed me a lot, Elder. I asked Kanda if he could do something for the village. He said he's even ready to give up his life. I told him that we'll fight against them. This society should give an answer for the lives lost in these three generations. Each and every officer who ignored your requests for help several times, has to give an answer now. They'll answer now, Elder. They will definitely answer. The counting process will not go on, if the ballot boxes are stuck here. The officers who were not here before will now come to collect this ballot box. They'll come, Sir. But the government officers won't come. Police officers will come. 3000 police officers will come here where a mere 300 people live. They point their guns at our chests and shoot us. They'll take that box away, Sir. Sir, until today, we only had both life and death. With this, we can't survive, Sir. We'll definitely die. Then give up your lives. But don't die with your hopes, don't die without questioning. Don't die suffering. As long as you adjust your lives for just surviving, you'll have to suffer. Only if you fight against them with your lives, you can live peacefully, Please trust me. I'll take the blame if anything goes wrong. If everything falls in place, the village will get benefitted. Sir, it's him. It's him, it's him. It's him who held a knife against the officers. Charge!! Sir, no sir. Manemma! Answer me! Where are they? Speak out! Where did you hide the ballot boxes and the officers? They are not the ones behind it. We'll not let you go until you guys release them. Please don't reveal Speak out! Speak out! Hit them... hit Don't tell them, Elder. Why are you stopping him? Tell me! Tell me! We all did this together. All the 300 members did this together. Who cares if there are 300 people? We'll beat the shit out of you idiots. You are 10 in number. We are 300. A person who cares for his life will get scared. If that same person doesn't care about his life, he'll fight back. This is our forest. We know how to hunt here. And how to kill as well. Hey! Do you know whom you are talking to? He's a DSP. Is he really a very powerful officer? Then ask him to sanction us a school, hospital and a bridge mainly. We'll leave your officers. Hey! We are from the police department. Why would we sanction all those? Then tell those respective officers to come, Sir. Hey! It's getting dark. Please head back. Please head back. Please head back. Head back, head back. Head back. Master. This is something we can discuss sitting across the table. Why are you taking such violent decisions? You and your stupid Telugu plans. I did a double MA. You should ask me. Now, how do you think that bridge will be sanctioned, sir? Tell me. Master. In 1953 when a Telugu person revolted, the state Andhra was formed. In 2014 when another Telugu person revolted a state Telangana was formed. When a Telugu person revolted, states were formed. Why won't a bridge get sanctioned? They'll sanction it. We'll get suspicion orders and arrest warrants. You guys could have gone ahead with it. Why did you involve me, sir? When did I involve you, Master? Try to recall once. I'm not giving it, Master. I should receive the award. I need to get an award for my sincerity, hardwork and dedication. I can't share it with anyone. - No I can't Just because I worked sincerely one day, I lost this much? Damn. I hate my sincerity. Damn it! Sir, They are here blue tick batch. We always thought that raising hands is wrong and forgot to lift up our heads. Today we all had a hope, It's all thanks to you. All that was your hard work. A person who fights for justice is much stronger than a person who threatens with power. Elder, you have that power. To us? They are not 10 people. The whole village did it. Right? There are a total of 300 people. At first, you told me that there is no criminal record on any of them. Now you are saying that all the villagers are criminals. If you would've told me this information before the election, the situation wouldn't have gotten out of control. Anyway, due to our intelligence failure they trapped us using their intelligence. 90 km of forest, spread across a circumference of 150km. If we go for combing, not only the officers that were there, we can't get back alive. That means, the village they live in is their strength. If we want to take that over and win upon them, what should we do? Why did you bring us to this forest? Where is the village? You can see a bael tree over there, it's behind that. Behind that? Where's the bael tree in those trees? People are becoming MROs and DROs without even knowing about bael trees. Let's go, sir. Please give it to me. Hold it. Give me, sir. Take these too. Come on. Coming sir. You talked about a bael tree and we were walking in the forest for the past 2 hours. Where is the tree? From the past 30 years the villagers requested you to come here several times. Did you ever come, sir? You guys were stuck in your city. And this bael tree is stuck in this hill. We get into a car as soon as we step out of the door. And we get into the office as soon as we get out of the car. We completely forgot to walk because of that, sir. That's called cholesterol. Hey! Where is the tree? How long do we have to walk? If we go ahead a little, we can see the stream. After crossing the stream we'll see a bael tree. The village is just after we cross the bael tree. A stream? Will there be a boat to cross it? If there's a boat, bridge or any other way to cross it, why would the villagers abduct those officers? Let's go, sir. -Go ahead. Such a bad fate! What's this? Hey! Veerayya !They'll come. They'll come, sir. What's this? Do we have to wait for them? When they came to your office, you made them wait. I guess they are taking revenge. Move aside. Give me the way. Get up, get up. Elder is coming. Hey! Do you know who we are? Who cares? He's our elder. Why are these people like this? Hey! What's this? You are here on a task. Please cooperate. Look. The collector sent us to give what you need and bring back our officers. Here are the orders. Read them. Kanda! Elder! It's written here that all the things we asked for are sanctioned. It's all God's grace. Please give the ballot box to us and send our officers. You can take these orders later. They sanctioned us so soon than we thought. You are the reason behind the happiness of our villagers. Hey! Move aside. We will definitely get an award from the government Hey go...Actually, your award also mine, I deserve it. Hello, Fellow officers Hi Mr Babu. Sir, they kidnapped and threatened us for this. Let's give them and go back, sir. How long are you going to take a look at it? Give it to them and come back. Come let's go... Yes sir, let's get out of here Let's head back before it gets dark. You are right, sir. Before they get to know that there's no official stamp or signature on this, let's leave. Come -Hey! Don't leave them! He's innocent, let him go. Sir, please save me. Sir, please save me. Sir, please do something and save the officer They have not fed me properly since 2 days -The award is not mine, sir, but yours... you deserve it It doesn't matter if you don't save me, sir. At least save Mr. Bokka, sir I'll give my award to you.. Please stop acting sir. Why don't you prepare the documents properly? Don't you check the signature? You bloody... I think your collector is planning to cheat us forever as we are innocent. Go and tell him that it's not possible anymore. Who told you to give them these fake documents? We wanted to get the ballot box by doing something. You know that we won't get an approval for a bridge immediately just because we ask for it. Central road Transport and National Highways, Public Works Department, Roads and bridges, Forest department, you know that we can't get an approval for a bridge even if all these departments come together. You know it too, right? you know it, right? I know sir -Then what's this, sir? I sent you to explain and educate them that it will take time. What did you do, sir? They are not afraid of the police. Now for the thing you did, they'll not trust the officers. How to convince him? -Sir... Sir, please go out Sir, please leave. Sir! I've got an idea. Would you like to listen? What's that? There's a person named Koteswararao. He's the secretary of the market yard. Let's send him for negotiation, sir. What are you saying, sir? They didn't release them when the police and the officers went. Will they release them if some market yard secretary goes for negotiation? They'll release them, sir. That's because all this time they didn't survive believing in our government or the officers. They believed in Koteswararao. They sold everything to him which they found in the forest. They don't believe any of our truths. But whatever Koteswararao says, they think that it's true. If I have to put it in a word, he's like a god to them. Call him. Sir. -Yes. Why did the collector call me? As soon as I received your call, I came here running leaving everything. Don't worry, Mr. Koteswararao. I'll take care. Are you sure? Yes. Sir. -Yes. Come on. This is the person about whom I told you earlier. Greetings, sir. -Greetings. I'm Koteswararao. For the past 15 years, the villagers have been electing me as the secretary for the market yard. In the Wednesday market yard, I own the Ayyappa organics shop. This is pure honey, sir. Yes.Well, our elders told us to not go with empty hands when visiting people like you. Please have a seat. -Thank you. This can't be found anywhere. I got this for you straight from the Maredumilli hill. By the way Mr. Koteswararao, you know the villagers well, right? What do you mean by just knowing them? I'm their only hope for the past 3 generations. Do you know that? I'm Koteswararao only here. I'm like a god to them there. Oh. Along with the ballot boxes, the Maredumilli villagers abducted the election officers. My goodness. They did such a big thing? We have counting in just 2 days. The process won't go ahead without that box. You are like a god to all of them. You should convince them. And bring the box back. Is that all? I'll do it. By noon tomorrow the officers and the ballot boxes will be here. By the way, in the market yard I tendered for 2 shops. Please make sure to pass the government order. Okay? You'll do it. I know. Mr. Koteswararao! You assigned me a tough task, sir. This is nothing when compared to that. The collector just has to sign it. What do you say, sir? Tell me. First finish the assigned task. Don't tell your family about this. That's enough for me, sir. But when you say my name on the television, please keep in mind that you should also mention my shop Ayyappa Organics in the market yard. You'll say it. I'll come to this office with those officers. Bye, sir. Greetings, boss! What are you searching for? I'm wondering if the government officers came along. I'm here since they are unable to finish the task. You are right, boss. The villagers trust you so much. Which way should we go to the village? There's a bael tree over there, it's behind that. By the way, remind me on our way back. Let's pluck all the bael leaves and send them to our people in the US. Those people will buy a pack for a minimum of 100 dollars. That means leaves can also be...? -We can sell them. They carry heavy bags and travel this much distance? Yes, boss. If they have a bridge and a road... Yes, yes. They'll put all the materials in a jeep and open a shop in the town and sell their organic products themselves. You are right. What should I do then? Should I just sit and stare? Boss... -Hey! People who live on the hills should stay there. A farmer should stay in the field. The products should be in my shop. Money should be in my account. Please listen to me, boss. Do I not know where I should keep them? If a road or bridge gets sanctioned for this village, I'm the first one to be at a loss. Do you think I'll let it come easily? It's wrong, boss. They see a god in you. Earlier in the collector's office, they said the same. I wonder how lucky I am. Even the officers love mediators more than the public. The planets should change their directions and feed him some grass. I'll give you a share in it. I mean in the grass. Greetings, Mr. God. -Hey, stay away. You are stinking of sweat. Stand away from me. Move... Move... What's this Mr. God? Why did you come all the way here by yourself? We would've come to you if you called us. Did you guys do a small thing? What happened, Mr. God? Shut up! If you guys need something, you should be asking me. I mean about the bridge. -What's with the bridge? Is that a mighty thing? I would've got it constructed by now if you asked me. I had to go to the collector and beg him to leave you all and tell him that you are my people. I even touched his feet. Do you know that? Okay leave it. Anyway, send with me the officers and the ballot box which is with you. Whatever favor you want, I'll do it for you. Sure, Mr. God. We'll listen to you. I guess you are tired walking up the hill. Eat something and take some rest. Okay Mr. God, Mr. God, Mr. God. Salutations to you Hey! Put me down. You all stay here. I'll go in. Get inside, Mr. God. Please go, Mr. God. Greetings, officers. Do you know who I am? I'm the god! From the past 3 generations... I'm the one who's filling their pockets and I'm the one who's filling their stomachs, too. Please bless me. -God bless you. We saw everything sir. From the past 3 generations we saw how you are cheating people in the market. You buy it for one buck and sell it for 100. That's called business. If you sell for profit it's called business. If you steal from them it's called cheating. Tell me one thing. In the past 30 years 4 lakh farmers killed themselves... because they couldn't get an affordable price for their harvest. But did ever a person who did business die? What? What are you saying? I came here to release you from them out of pity. How dare you call me a cheater? I'm not going to take them. Silly Koteswararao. You are going overboard without knowing about the matter. What's the matter? You are the one who actually got abducted. What? But you are a god! So they didn't tie you up and brought you here respectfully with a garland around your neck. You are officially abducted. Hey! Hey! Hey! What's wrong, Mr. God? I don't like those officers. Keep them with you. If you give me the ballot box, I'll leave. Sure, Mr. God. We are making a chair to carry you. As soon as the bridge is sanctioned, we'll send you. As soon as the bridge is sanctioned? -yes. Is that a pack of chips that can be found in a shop? How can they simply sanction it as soon as you ask? That's a bridge. We are not in a hurry, Mr. God. Until then you can stay inside. Get inside. Get inside. Get inside. -I got it. Get inside. -I got it. I got it. What's with this garland? Is this for me coming here by myself to get trapped? Do you still have that doubt? They called me god and put fire under me. That's not fire, Mr. Koteswararao. That's their frustration. Please bless me. -God bless you. Are you still thinking that you are a god? Am I not? Crap! What's the use if we keep Mr. God with us? We've got no time, Kanda. Only if he is here, the people there will start to feel the tension. Come on, ma'am. Greetings! -Greetings come... Have a seat Please have a seat. Tell me. My husband went out in the morning and didn't return, sir. When I inquired in the shop they said that he came to the collector's office. Don't worry. We sent him on a task. He'll come back soon. Yes. -Sir. It's an official matter. What's official? Tell me here. Mr. Koteswararao was abducted. What? He's abducted? Don't worry. He'll come back. Take her. What are you saying? They told me to convey that they are not going to send anyone back until they get what they want. Sir! -Yeah! I thought I would return soon. So I didn't bring my hypertension and diabetes medications. I wonder how to escape from here. If you try, you'll be lost in this forest and can never get out in this lifetime. They need to drop us, sir. We can't avoid this. What did you say? Do you have forgetfulness as well? They need to drop us, sir. We can't avoid this. They need to drop us themselves, right? Look at my performance now. Ouch! It's hurting! Mr. God! -Oh, Mr. God! It's hurting! Mr. God! -Oh, Mr. God! What happened to him? -What happened? Mr. God! What happened? Please tell.. I can't breathe. Take me to the hospital. Take me to the hospital. Hey, Bring a cot! -I can't breathe. What happened to my god? -What happened? Go there... go I can't breathe. -Get him on the cot! Bring him. Bring him. It's hurting. Move... move... -It's hurting. Take me to the hospital immediately. I'm unable to bear this pain. I'm in pain. I'm in pain...It's hurting. Why did you stop? They caught him. Why are you turning the cot when I'm asking you to take me to a hospital? Oh no! If I die, what will happen to my family? Hey! It's hurting. Sir, Mr. God is suffering from heart pain. He's asking us to take him to the hospital. Shall we take him? I'm dying here, what's with you taking his permission? Oh God! If it's this serious, he'll die on the way. First we need to give him CPR. What does CPR mean? We'll place our hands on your chest cavity and press your heart 20 times. Oh gosh! Someone will blow air into your mouth very hard. Oh no! If you blow the air that hard I might die. Sir, don't think that I'm just a Telugu teacher. I'm an NCC master, too. I'll save you. No... No... No. It's enough. You come and blow air into his mouth. What's with him? My god, I'll save you. What are you going to do? -I'm here for you. What? I'll save you. It's much better to die! My god! My god! -Hey! No! No! Sir, Nothing will happen to you Blow the air again. -Again? No!! My god! No!! I'm fine. All thanks to him. You all can go back to your homes. You should be safe and sound always, Mr. God. First you leave. Please go. You can also leave. Please go. Don't know what disease he have First wash your mouth with some antiseptic. Otherwise you'll get infections. Haven't I already told you that they themselves should drop us? Yes -You won't listen? You are right. By the way, all these people believed in my acting. Why didn't you believe me? -Your acting was great! Thanks.But in that excitement you forgot that the heart is on the left side. I'll correct it next time. You are again touching your right side. Oh sorry! Don't try this next time. -What if I do? He'll not keep his mouth in yours -Then? Catch him. What's that? It looks like a new bird. That's a drone camera belonging to the military. Come on, everyone. Make it fast. Go, go, go. Spread out. Spread out. Look into all the houses. Look into the house beside it. Yes, go ahead. You go there. There is no one here, sir. -What are you doing? Go there. Come on, go and search that house also. Is anybody there? There is no one here, sir. And there? -The whole village is empty sir. Hey! I know that you all are hiding somewhere here. Handover us the ballot box and the officers you abducted. Will you send the ballot box and the officers or will you see these people getting killed? I'm giving you 5 minutes of time. We'll kill a person every minute. Fire! The military is here to protect the people of this country... not to kill the people who are innocent. What we are doing now is a war, Kanda? If we get scared or step back they'll win this. Hit! You are actually not hitting me. You are hitting the negligence of government officials who ignored you so far. Hit me, Kanda. Hit me in front of everyone. Hey! What are you doing? You kill them and we'll kill these people. Ithiri! So that we can be equal. Kill them, sir. Kill them. If you are unable to focus on the target, tell us. We'll come and stand right in front of you. Tell us if you can't see our chests properly. We'll stand there with bare chests. But we'll not spare anyone if justice is not served. All this time we thought that the military is there for protecting people. Will you too kill people for the sake of officers? Kill them... Sir. Guns down! Sir! Mr. Dhamveer is on the line. Hello? -Sir, It's Mr. Dhamveer. I'm not saying that what they are doing is right. What? But what we are doing is wrong. What are you saying? The military is for the people. Even the government too. They are not any terrorists or naxalites I can't shoot them Please listen to me, Mr.Dhamveer. Let's go. Sir! Please forgive me sir. I raised my hand on you who's like a God! Please forgive me, sir. Please forgive me, sir. Until you forgive me I'll not leave you feet! Kanda! Get up! Please forgive me sir. It's not enough, Kanda. We need more support from the people. People should know about what's happening here. Sir! Kanda! Look into this and speak. What should I speak about, sir? Speak about your struggles. Speak about your lives. Tell them about the hurdles you are going through. Tell them about the lives you lost. What about you Lakshmi? If you just do sacrifices will the village simply get better? Question them. Question the government which has been ignoring you all this time Question the people who didn't even care about you when you were taking Appanna's corpse. Lakshmi. This is the one and only chance you have to make the village win. Speak out. Hello! You are watching TV9. My name is Netra. The people of the wild are asking for their development. At this moment when the country is celebrating the Diamond Jubilee of independence day celebrations, the viral video of Maredumilli people is exclusively for you. We are humans, too, sir. But we are from the forest. The animals here won't harm us. That's because we live with them. But when we come into people, they are looking at us like animals. When we asked for proper roads we were ignored. When we asked for a proper school we were ignored. When we asked for a hospital we were ignored. When we asked for a bridge we were ignored. That's why I'm speaking up! We are humans too. Even we want to lead a decent life. We want our kids to get educated. We want to save our people who are dying. Until now, we hid all our anger and struggles. We came out to fight back because our people are dying. Sir. Even if you send the police or the military we are not going to step back. If we have to die, we'll die for our rights. We'll not die with our hopes. We'll die proudly with our heads up. We'll never die begging. Until we get what we want, we'll not give the ballot box and the officers. The one who helps is human... the one who attacks is a beast. We are humans as well, sir. Help us if you too are human. Yours, People of Maredumilli. Tribals said they will not send officers and ballot boxes if their demands are not met. Will the government and the collector step down in this situation and fulfil their demands? Or will they take any alternative measures? What is the condition of the officers who are kidnapped? Mr. Trivedi! -Sir. Will the counting start tomorrow? Sure, it will sir. Sir, before we start counting, if we have any repairs with an EVM box, we'll put it aside and we'll go on with the counting. Sir, as per the records, if we look into the last 10 elections every candidate won with a difference of 30-40 thousand votes. So, these 248 votes will not make much difference. We can make these 248 votes invalid and start with the counting. Has this ever happened before? No, but with this will set an example, sir We can count sir Will the candidates agree to it? Our party has sympathy because our leader passed away. Why do you care about a mere 248 votes? How can you stop counting because of them? Start the counting process. I'm fine with it. Did you not take a look at the surveys, sir? We'll win with a majority of 30,000 votes. We don't care about those mere 248 votes. Start the counting process immediately. Please go ahead. You can proceed. Thank you. Everyone please be seated. Ask the questions one by one We heard that you sent the military to attack the villagers of Maredumilli. Will you attack your people being a collector? What's wrong in what the villagers asked? To do favors to the contractors, you are giving permissions to them for laying roads by deliberately damaging the existing roads. Why are you hesitating to give permission to construct a bridge? Can you all calm down please may I speak... I saw the video you all saw. But you guys didn't see the video I have seen. Come on, take a look. So, do you think that they are innocent just because a girl talked while crying? Today officers got abducted like this for the first time in the country. They are threatening us saying that they won't return the ballot boxes. If the government lower its head to them today, it happened here today and it will happen everywhere. Who'll value law and order? Tell me. All these people are terrorists. Tell me how should we deal with them? Sir! How are you going to go forward with the counting process without that ballot box? We care more about the opinion of the 300k people who voted than those 248 votes. That's why without that EVM, according to the schedule the counting process will get started. But the officers are abducted! What about their lives? They will be safe. We'll not let go of them if they harm our officers. Abducting the public officers on duty is a criminal offense. They'll get punished. - Thank you. - Sir. Sir. What are you going to do now, sir? Breaking news. The tyranny of Maredumilli villagers with government officials. Villagers of Maredumilli misled the public with fake videos. The collector revealed the truth with proof. Threatening the government with acts of violence will not be tolerated. Collector Arjun Trivedi has warned the people of Maredumilli... that the election counting will be done at the scheduled time under any circumstances. It's over, sir. Everything is finished. You worked hard for the future of these people. But everyone is calling them criminals. You achieved 100% voting by working so hard. But they are saying that they don't need to count them now. In Democracy, you said that every vote is valuable. Is that a lie? Just like us, does our vote don't have a value too? It's finished. You are finished and your village is finished too. You dared to resist against the government just because this teacher told you. They'll crush you. You and your lives are nothing. What about you, teacher? You fooled all my people? Hey! If there's any god that can save you, it's only me. At least listen to me now. Let us put all the blame on him and let's continue our businesses. What do you say? Oh no! Since the moment we were born, We were living, lowering our heads. Just because we lifted our heads up, you are getting worried. Do you think our lives are not worthy? How can you live without us? Why are you a god to us? Even though he's not related to us, even though he doesn't have any business with us, he's risking his life for us, he's our god. He is our god. Kanda! Please treat humans with humanity. They are okay with you not giving them money. Just give them the assurance that you are with them. They'll take care of their lives themselves. Breaking news! Counting of the by-elections, which everyone is eagerly waiting for, has started. The counting has started in the Rampachodavaram constituency. Will the ruling party win? Or is the opposition party going to take over? We'll know the results in a few hours. Rampachodavaram assembly constituency. Counting of the postal votes starts now. By the time first round counting is finished, Chaitanyadeepam party's candidate Mr. Peddireddy Nagireddy is leading with a majority of 10,000 votes. By the time the third round counting is finished, the ruling party's candidate Mr. Peddireddy Nagireddy is leading with a majority of 15,000 votes. Oh, good. As you expected, there are chances that the candidate will win with a majority of 30-40 thousand votes. Very good. Sir, your party is in leading... how do you feel about it? No one dares to win against our party By the time 11th round counting is finished, ruling party's candidate Mr. Peddireddy Nagireddy is leading with a majority of 5000 votes. The result of 12 th round. Mr. Peddireddy Nagireddy is leading with a majority of 3000 votes. In the 13 th round, Mr. Peddireddy Nagireddy is leading with a majority of 1236 votes. Last round counting start The ruling party's candidate Mr. Peddireddy Nagireddy won with a majority of 25 votes. Collector sir will declare and give the declaration form. How's that possible? Something went wrong in the counting process. The ruling party misused its power. They planned this in advance and said that we lost. What are you waiting for? Let's go and do a fasting demonstration. Nothing like that happened. The whole process was done before you. He won with a majority of 25 votes. There are still 248 votes left. What are you saying? The collector already told you that EVM will not be included in the counting. You all agreed to it. We'll give 100 assurances in politics. Will we do them all after winning or will we stand on our words? You tell me. They won 5 times. If they did something in favor of Maredumilli villagers, why would they bother in keeping the ballot box to themselves? And that village comes to our province, all those are our people. This is too much, sir. We don't know what you'll do. You should make sure to bring the ballot box from Maredumilli and count it. Otherwise our party will protest. We'll drag you and the government on to the streets! Mind it. Hey, let's go Hail Mr. Madugula Suresh Naidu! Hail Mr. Madugula Suresh Naidu! Your effort won, sir. The votes of these people have a value now. The 248 votes of the Maredumilli ballot box should be counted. The result should be announced only after that. Until the box arrives, we will continue this fasting demonstration. Maredumilli ballot box should be counted Collector sir... No one will leave here until those 248 votes are counted. You should count it. -Please tell us, sir. Will the counting still go on? Sir... You messed up the entire situation. No, sir. Enough of this nonsense Put all your ego aside and find a solution. No more excuses Make sure that you go there personally and bring the ballot box back. Make sure that the counting process is complete. Got it? -Sure, sir. All okay sir? "The people of the village, the insects and animals, the soil and the sky" "brought so many words in the air with hope." "Coo-ing cuckoo, the stem is a swing to you. Start singing today." "The shining moon and the flowing stream should start dancing to the sound of the drums." "In this hill, where Lord Veerabadra is backing us and lighting our lives." "In a path where there is no death, he came to us, held our hands and showed us the way." "Our blood burned like a furnace." "Now everyone's lives will be green." "Thanks to you, our village is now alright." "The happiness came back." "The suffering we went through for years is now gone, thanks for your support. " "We are back to our lives and happy." "We just stepped one step ahead. And you got your value." "Your village looks happy. Please take care of your kids." "You were unable to see our sufferings." "May your day be filled with happiness. We will never forget your kindness." "The festival is here " "If you love a village like this, I will give you my heart." "If the villagers are smiling like this," " I will hold your hand and be with you." Where's the village? There's a bael tree over there, sir. It's behind that. - Show me the way. - Okay. Please come sir. Greetings. -Greetings. Greetings. Sir... take this... -Hey, what is this? wait No! Give it to me. Take it. Greetings sir. You all have shared your problems. But it's really hard to have them all here. I'll do one thing. I'll have a word with the government. We'll allot you land down the hill in the town. We'll help you financially to build your houses. There are schools, hospitals and everything over there. You all can stay happy there. What, Sir? We should leave the forest and live in a town? This forest is our mother. Our traditions and our god is here. Everything is here, Sir. For several generations, we have been living here. We are living here. Even if we are poor... we have never slept with empty stomach. We'll get edible roots if we dig out land. We have fruits on the trees. We have the stream water. And we can find rice in the forest, Sir. This forest is the future given to us by God. If a person leaves his mother who fed him for his own happiness, can we call him human, Sir? If such a person lives here, we'll not even bring his body to the burial ground. How can you ask us to leave this village, Sir? I know. I know that you guys won't agree. That's why; I'm going to sanction everything in your presence. I'm even signing the letter. Will you now let our officers and the ballot box free? Sir. Come on, take it. Very happy! We are very happy sir. When we prayed to Lord Veerabhadra to solve our problems... You came here like a god and brought us out of our struggles, sir. Yes sir.Hail Veerabadra! -Hail Veerabadra! Please stop it... stop.. ??? Kanda! Bring the officers. Hi sir. This is yours sir... Yours obediently Here, sir. Mr. God. Please don't mind all this. You are our god! No. I cheated all of you until now. You all should forgive me for that. From now on, I will only do business with you. And that too fairly. You should, Mr. Koteswararao. Until now, they thought Maredumilli villagers were just people who live on the hills. They only know now that they are knives. India is winning, I can actually feel it. I can.... Jai Hind sir. Take them. Hey! Sir, why did so many policemen come? This is cheating, sir. Please listen to me once, sir. Sir.. sir.. sir.. Please don't hit us. Please stop it. Sir, sir... Please listen to me once, sir. They are innocent. I'm the one who gave the idea of kidnapping us. They are innocent. Please tell them to let go. They are innocent. I beg you, sir. Sir! Sir! "Trying to suppress our rights?" "Is it a democracy where it doesn't care about the people?" "Is Authority the national anthem?" "Is India a story of tears?" "Then what about the darkness in the village?" "How will the public see the light?" You are a Telugu teacher after all. How dare you provoke the public against the collector? We celebrate a day for the teachers in this country. But there's no day for collectors to celebrate. Won't this be enough, sir? To say the greatness about the teachers? I'm a collector who received an award from the president. I don't need a day. You set up a polling booth on the hill to live up to its reputation. Not to do something to them. You are selfish, sir. If our nation should be developed, the change should start to take place in 2 areas. First, the politicians. Second in the government officers. Until the election process is completed, the politicians treat the people as gods and make them sit in the temple and come to them. As soon as they win in the election... the politicians will go and sit in the temple and the people will start to wait for them in a queue. These pitiful people. For every 5 years they even try by not changing the god. But all the boons are just being as assurances that are not done. They are forever living in those huts. It should be changed, sir. Every facility that the government is providing, it is being called as a service. Public health service. Indian administrative service. It is saying the names of some services and started a public service commission, too. The public is in it and the commissions too. But there is no service. Even a peon who works in a government office looks down on people. This should change, sir. If we don't change, the people will. They can't bear it. Are you done? Are you done lecturing about these people? The same government which gave rights to the people to protest gave us the power to oppress the people. Sir! sir! Sir, he's very good man sir. Sir, Lord Veerabadra's cattle are going. Please sit. What? He's the village's god. Please be seated for a minute. He will go. What's this? Are you staging a new play? Should a collector stop if the cattle come? Sir... Shoot them. Kill them if possible. No sir. Take positions. Fire! Constables, shield! 'Sanskrit chant' 'Sanskrit chant' Let's go... 'Sanskrit chant' 'Sanskrit chant' 'Sanskrit chant' 'Sanskrit chant' 'Sanskrit chant' Give me your hand. Hail Veerabadra! -Hail Veerabadra! Where is the collector sir? Search for him! Sir, sir. Please get up. Sir, sir... Kanda! Elder, come on. Sir... Sir. Hold him... let's take him to the hospital. Lift him up. Life is same for all Lift him up. Come... Lift him up. Lift him up. -Lift him up. Be careful. Come.. come.. fast.. Bring him fast. Kanda! Here. Hey! The stream flow is heavy. Let's go on the other side. -No. We never got to save a person by going that way. Let's go this way. Ithiri! Listen to me. Don't delay Sir! Kanda! Give me the axe. Hey, go and help him Come on. Be careful. Bring him. Take care about collector sir Be careful. Be careful...watch out. Hey! Come... Get him down Lift! Hold him. Malli! Bring the aerial roots of the tree. Take care Careful Please be careful sir. Sir.. sir... Sir... Come on... Guys come on... Come.. -Hold it... Hold him tight Pull it. Pull it hard Pull it. Be careful. It's very deep... Beware Careful... Careful... Quickly... Lord Veerabhadra, please save him. Here it is sir, the thing you wanted. Please make sure that the politician wins. But give it a second thought. Every time there are elections the government asks the people to vote for a change. But that change is only occurring in the life of a politician. Why is it not changing the lives of people who voted? Even Veerabadra who can't talk understood these people's pain. Do you know why you don't understand? We all want to become great people. But no one wants to become a human first. They are not asking for a bridge, sir. They are asking for their lives. They are not asking schools. They are asking the future of their kids. They are not asking hospitals. They are asking for health. Can't our government provide them at least? I'm not sure if a politician can change the lives of the people. But a government official's signature definitely can. You have the right to do that signature. You have the signature in your hands which can bring the change. Use the power not to gain your status but for a change. 'After 2 months' A Telugu master told me that... if a change is bound to happen in our country, we don't know whether it will come from politicians or not, but it will definitely come from the signature of a government official. I know that the way they asked is not correct. But is it right for us to ignore them for 30 long years? Let's correct our mistakes. Let's be the first to sign for a change. Drop all the charges we filed on the villagers. Okay, sir. Greetings, sir. -Greetings. Are you fine? -Yes. Master. Like how we celebrate teachers day annually. Will a single signature be enough to celebrate a day for us? Or do we need more? Do you still remember that? I'm sorry, sir. No. It was good advice. The bridge got sanctioned. They'll not believe my words. You should tell them. Elder. The bridge got sanctioned. Greetings, sir. Thank you, sir. -Good. Thank you. -All the best. Move... Sir! Sir! We got the bridge sanctioned, all thanks to you! It's all because of you! It's all because of you! We got the bridge sanctioned, all thanks to you! We are so happy, sir. Sir! Sir. My name is lachchimi. - I studied until 7th standard. - I'm a teacher in this village! I won't get a salary and I'm an orphan. You'll have a problem with me. I love my village so much. If any problem arises in the village, I might not be by your side. If I want to be me, I want a guy who's just the same as me. That's you. Will you marry me? Coo-ing cuckoo, the stem is a swing to you. Start singing today. The shining moon and the flowing stream should start dancing to the sound of the drums. In this hill, where Lord Veerabadra is backing us and lighting our lives. In a path where there is no death, he came to us, held our hands and showed us the way.
