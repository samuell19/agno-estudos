[clicking] [dog barking] [dramatic music] [folksy music] [door opening] [muffled crying] - [Kathrine] Who's there? [gasping] [crying] - [Celee] Shh. [gasping] - Help! [muffled yelling] Help! [muffled yelling] [gasping] [folksy music] [scraping footsteps] [screaming] Help! Somebody! Help! [screaming] Somebody help! [gasping] Help! [gasping] - [Celee] No one can hear you out here in the country. - What do you want? - [Celee] This will all be over in a couple of hours. - This isn't funny. - [Celee] Just stay calm. - Who are you? - [Celee] That's not important. - Are you from Delta Chi? - What? - Are you a pledge? - [Celee] What are you talking about? - Look, if Marilyn put you up to this you better stop right now. I just had my hair done and it's totally ruined! Somebody is gonna have to pay. - [Buddy] You damn right somebody's gonna have to pay. [gasping] Your old man. - [Celee] Did you get him on the phone? - [Buddy] No, they said he's at a business lunch. - [Celee] How long will he be there? - [Buddy] Well I don't know, sometimes these business lunches... - Are you talking about my father? - [Buddy] Who do you think we're talking about? [scoffing] - Is this like a real kidnapping? With a ransom? - [Buddy] It will be, soon as I talk to your daddy. He should be back from the market by now, right? - I don't... - [Buddy] Yes or no? - No. Not on Wednesday. - [Buddy] Why not? - Rotary. - [Buddy] What the hell are you talking about? - Rotary Club luncheon, he has too many martinis, he goes home and takes a nap. - [Buddy] What's the goddamn number? - I'm not gonna tell you. - [Celee] We could just look it up. - [Buddy] No, I want her to tell me. - Well I'm not gonna. - [Buddy] You wanna make this hard on yourself, don't you? Be my guest. - [Celee] Buddy! [whimpering] - Goddamn it, Celee. You just said my name. [scoffing] Why do you think that we have these stupid bags on our heads? Huh? So she don't know who we are. And then you go and say my name? - I'm sorry, Buddy, you just scared me. - Well baby, it's supposed to scare her, not you. - [Celee] You weren't really gonna hit her, were you? - No! No baby, I'm pretending. Like they do in the movies, you know? You gotta make 'em think you're a bad guy even when you're not. Come on, baby. Okay? - Okay. - Now I'm gonna go upstairs and look up the number, okay? Stay here, keep an eye on her. - Buddy? $100,000 is an awful lot. - Baby, he owns three markets. He drives a Caddy. Hell, baby, he's got an in-ground pool. - I know, but... - No. You don't know. Let me handle this. Don't you pout. - I'm not pouting. - You are pouting, I see that kitty on your lip. - No! - You are pouting! - No! - Who is daddy's little girl? Who's daddy's little girl? [laughing] Daddy's little baby, poor baby. [laughing] Okay? - Yeah. - [Buddy] Okay. Stay here and keep an eye on her. - Don't be too long. - Any time away from you is too long, baby. Okay? - Don't you look at me! [rotary phone clicking] [phone ringing] - Answer the damn phone. [phone ringing] - So what do they call you? - Who? - Your friends? I bet you have a lot of friends. Do they call you Katie? - No. Only my father calls me that. My friends call me Kathrine. - Hmm. Must be nice, having lots of friends. Are most of 'em in your sorority? - I guess. - Is Marilyn a friend? - Who? - The girl you were talking about. - She's a sister. - You have a sister? [chuckling] - A sorority sister not a real sister. - Oh. I never made it to college. I finished high school though. Are you an only child? - Yes. - Me too! [chuckling] Mom said I was a blessing from God since she wasn't supposed to have babies. - Are you going to hurt me? [scoffing] - I wouldn't hurt you, Kathrine. - What about him? - No, he's not like that. He just gets excited when things don't go the way they're supposed to. - I'll do whatever you want. - That'll make it easier. [rotary phone clicking] [phone ringing] - [Buddy] Answer the goddamn phone. - Sorry about your hairdo. It looked nice when we picked you up. All done up, fresh like that. You think that style would look good on me? - I guess. - Maybe I'll try it. What do you think? - Why me? - 'Cause you're rich. - I'm not rich! - Well your daddy is, or that's what Buddy says. [phone ringing] - [John] Hello? - [Buddy] Hello, Mr. Tremaine, Mr. John Tremaine? - [John] Yeah, who's this? - [Buddy] You don't know me, sir, but I need to talk to you. - [John] Well what the hell do you want then? I was trying to take a nap! - [Buddy] Well I'm sorry to wake you, sir, but I need to talk to you about your daughter. - [John] Katie's not here. - [Buddy] I know that, sir... [dial tone buzzing] Goddamn it. [rotary phone clicking] [water dripping] [phone ringing] - [John] This better not be that same son of a bitch... - Will you shut up and listen to me? - [John] Who do you think you are? - I am the one that's got your daughter. - [John] What do you mean you've got my daughter? - I've got her tied up in my basement right now. - [John] Is this some kind of joke? - Do you hear me laughing, sir, huh? Do you? Got your attention, didn't I? Woke you up? - Who is this? - Does that really matter, sir? 'Cause I just don't think so. You see, all that matters is that you get your daughter back alive. So if you wanna see her again, it's gonna cost you $100,000. - [John] I don't have that kind of money. - A rich man like you can get it. - [John] Who are you? - All that you need to know is that I want $100,000, do you hear me? - [John] How do I know you've even got my daughter? - 'Cause I say so! - Well that's not good enough! - Well how 'bout she just got her hair done? - [John] Well how 'bout so what? Anyone could've seen her get her hair done. - How 'bout her dead body, sir? Would that be proof enough for you, seeing your little girl dead in a gutter somewhere? - [John] Now wait, hold on just a... - 'Cause I'll do it! - I didn't mean to... - Don't you think that I won't! - [John] No. Please, I'm sorry. - That's more like it, sir. Now we gotta talk about what we're gonna do. - [John] Maybe I could raise 50. - 50? - [John] But it'll take a couple of days, I... - This ain't open for discussion, sir. - [John] Look, I don't have... - Oh, bullshit! - [John] Just let my daughter go and I promise you I'll get you the 50. - You think I'm an idiot? - No, I, look, I just can't raise... - Listen, sir! - That kind of money. - I will kill her, does that mean anything to you? I will kill your daughter, I'll do it! - [John] Okay, okay, okay, okay, just please don't hurt my little girl. - You can't even raise $100,000 to save your little baby? [John stammering] - [John] Look, if I could I would, I'm telling you I can't! Please, I'm begging you! If I could get that much money I would! - Are you sure you can't get $100,000? - [John] It's impossible, I can't do it. - But you can get 50? - Yes. Guarantee it. Please. - By Friday? - Yes. - And no later? - No later, I promise. - I'm gonna call you back. [sighing] - [Celee] Those pearls sure are pretty. I wish I had some. Man... - What the hell are you doing? - [Celee] Just talking. - [Buddy] Where's your bag? - I forgot it. - You forgot it? - I'm sorry. - How do you forget it? - You got me all upset and I wasn't thinking and I walked in and, well, what's done is done. You gonna leave yours on? - Yeah. Yeah, I am. - Looks kinda stupid. - No, no, stupid is letting her see your face, okay? That's stupid. - What did her daddy say? [sighing] - [Buddy] We're gettin' the money, baby. And I think that 50 will be easier for us to carry. So we're getting 50. - My father's giving you $50,000? - [Buddy] That's right, Friday. - I thought we were getting it today? - [Buddy] No, it takes time to put that kind of money together. - What about your aunt? - [Buddy] She ain't comin' back 'til Saturday. - What are we gonna do with her for two days? - [Buddy] We gonna get to know each other. [folksy music] [snoring] - Buddy. [snoring] Buddy. Buddy. - [Buddy] What? - You were snoring. - [Buddy] Sorry. What is that? - A list of things we should buy with the money. - [Buddy] Let me see that. - So far I've got a blender, a vacuum cleaner, a Hoover. - [Buddy] 'Cause they suck? [laughing] - Maybe we should give some money to the church? - [Buddy] Not from my share, you gotta put a T-Bird down for me. - A family wagon would make more sense. - [Buddy] I can't breathe in this damn thing. Oh that's much better, baby. [breathing deeply] - I think we'll need two sets of sheets. - [Buddy] I guess so. - Maybe some... - Excuse me. I need to talk to you. - [Buddy] What, you an expert on sheets or something? - I need to... - [Buddy] What? - Do you need to pee, hon? - [Buddy] Hold it. - Buddy, guys can hold it 'cause they've got something to hold, girls just have to go. - [Buddy] Fine but I'm not untying her hands. - Well what is she gonna pee into? - [Buddy] I dunno. [rattling] There ya go. - Well turn around. - [Buddy] Oh for Christ's sake. - [Celee] Okay, let me help you a bit. If you just scooch over and, yeah, and I'll get your skirt. [urinating] [ketchup squirting] - [Buddy] What are you doing? - Putting ketchup on my fries. - [Buddy] That's disgusting. - Let's say Grace. Bless this food and the nourishment of our body and soul, may we always be aware of your loving presence. Thank you, Jesus, amen. [laughing] - [Buddy] Shit. - Take it off. - [Buddy] I'm not gonna take it off. I can do this. Stupid burger, goddamn... - Buddy. Doesn't that feel better? - I guess so. Don't you look at me. I'm not gonna have her staring at me. - Well she can't always look at the floor. - Why not? - That's dumb! What if she promises not to stare? - I don't know. - It's better than that bag over your head. Do you promise not to stare at Buddy? All right then, that's settled. Okay? - She starts lookin' at me, there's gonna be trouble. - She knows that. - [Buddy] Fine. - I feel funny eating in front of her. - Do you want a root beer or grape soda? - Buddy... - I got her a burger! - Well how's she gonna eat it all tied up? - I'm not untying her hands! - [Celee] Then we're going to have to feed her. - Judas Priest, then you feed her! I don't know which one of you is more trouble. - It has everything on it except onions. - Thank you. - I'm taking the root beer. - Is it okay? - It's good, I'm just not that hungry. - I understand. Must be pretty upset. You want the grape soda or the orange soda? - I bought the grape soda for you, Celee. - I'll take the orange soda. - If you want the grape soda you can have the grape soda. - The orange is fine. - You gonna need a church key? [keys rattling] - I like the soda better in the fountain than the bottle. - Well I wasn't gonna drive all the way into town. - It's fine. That's where Buddy and me met. I was eating a cheeseburger. He was at the magazine rack. It was just like the movies. Our eyes met and that's it. I knew. [gasping] [Buddy laughing] Oh, I'm sorry, Buddy get a towel! - What for? - It's gonna leave a stain! - Oh my god, who cares? - Buddy! - For the love of god! - It's all right. - No, it's not, I'm sorry. Buddy, go get a towel now! - Use this. [yelling] - That is filthy, I need a clean towel! - Fine, I'll get a goddamn clean towel! Do everything around here. Ain't one thing it's another. - I'm sorry! - Stupid. - This isn't fair! - [Celee] If you take it off then I can soak it. - I can't take it off! - Right. If you promise not to run away I'll untie your hands. Promise? Okay. Get this knot, all right. I'll take off your blouse. And if you pull it up then I can soak it in the sink maybe. Then I'll do your skirt. Shoot. I didn't mean to, I'm so sorry. But I'll fix it, I'll fix this. Honestly, I just, I'll just work... [screaming] What are, no, you promised! Stop! Buddy! Buddy, Buddy! [thudding] I'm sorry Buddy. She promised and I'm sorry. - Get your ass up and get back in the chair. [gasping] [gun cocking] I'm not gonna ask you again. - What are you doing? - Shut up. [gasping] Hold it on her. Celee, take the goddamn gun. [whimpering] I swear to god if you don't take this gun... Can you at least tie her hands? Huh, can you do that? - Mm-hmm. - Well do it! [crying] [groaning] [crying] [gasping] Are you done? - I'm almost done. - Are you done? [crying] [gasping] [crying] Do you see what comes from trying to be nice? - She gave me her word! - Rich people lie all the time! You can just sit there with your shirt off and see how you like that.

I had two beers and he went in to kiss me, I threw up all over on the back seat. - I bet that slowed him down. - Sure didn't sweeten the moment. - Thank you. - It wasn't supposed to be like this. Buddy said we'd pick you up, get the money and start living. [sighing] I just wanted it to be different. Do you believe in dreams? - Not really. - I dreamed I saw Patsy Cline before she died. I was in a field of red roses and Patsy came down to me and she said, "Your prayers have been answered." And I said, "But he's a stranger in my arms." And she said, "Just stand by your man." Isn't that sweet? And then she was gone. I think she was talking about Buddy. - [Buddy] Y'all done yet? - Guess so. Go dump this outside. - I'm eating. [sighing] - Buddy! - I'm not touching that. - You're such a baby! I'll be right back. [saw whirring] - This would make a great bomb shelter. The Russians decide to drop the big one... Be a good place to duck and cover. Not that that kind of stuff scares me. I say live for today, you know what I mean? Because that's all you got. You ain't guaranteed nothin'. I bet you always got what you wanted. I wasn't gonna give you any. - Don't! [phone ringing] - [Celee] Buddy, Buddy come quick! Buddy! - [Buddy] I heard you the first time! [phone ringing] [gasping] - [Celee] Should we answer it? [stammering] - No. - Well do something, Buddy, do something! - Shut up, Celee. [phone ringing] [suspenseful music] - Make it stop! - Will you shut the fuck up, I'm trying to think! - I'm scared, I'm scared! - Celee, Celee, shut up! [screaming] I'm trying to fucking think here! [crying] I'm sorry. Okay? You got to do as you're told! Okay, I didn't mean to hurt you but you wouldn't listen to me. And you gotta listen to me, you have to trust me, baby, I know what I'm doing! You have to trust me. Okay? It's over now. It's over. [crying] I'm sorry, okay baby? Daddy's sorry. Do you forgive me? Please say you forgive me. Just say you forgive daddy. - You scared me. - I know, I know, and daddy's sorry. [somber music] Okay? - Okay. [gasping] - You know what, baby? You know what? I bet that was a wrong number. That happens all the time. - You think? - Sure. Well, yeah, I do, I mean, who would call my aunt anyway? 'Specially when she ain't even here. - I guess you're right. I'm sorry. - Don't you give another thought to it. We all make mistakes. To err is human. And to forgive is divine. [somber music] - Want some? Smells real nice. Buddy gave it to me. - [Buddy] Drugstore perfume ain't good enough for you? - No thank you. - Ah, stupid lures! - You okay? - Yeah. I always hated fishin'. I either fell in the water or got told a million times to shut up. - Well at least you were with your daddy. - No, my daddy was gone, I was with my uncle. I spent too many summers here. [sighing] Waste of time. [bubblegum popping] [giggling] Oh you think you can do better? Knock yourself out. [sighing] - Stop! - What? - That. [sighing] This is boring. I said this is boring. - [Buddy] I heard you. - This was supposed to be fun. - [Buddy] Baby, we'll have fun soon as we get the money. - I'm bored now! - If you're so bored why don't you go get us supper? - Fine! I will! I need money. - Her purse is upstairs, get some outta there. - That's stealing. - You don't mind, do you? - Would it matter? - No. Keys are on the kitchen table. - I'll just take enough for the food. - And get me some ice cream, chocolate. - [Celee] Chocolate, okay! [suspenseful music] - Are you scared? [gasping] You should be. One little slip. [gasping] [imitating slicing] What would your boyfriend say if you were missing a titty? [suspenseful music] [tapping] [banging] - You wanna touch them? [chuckling] It's all right. [suspenseful music] Gentle. - I know what I'm doin'. - Just not so hard. [thunder rumbling] You can take off my bra. Snaps in the back. You're so sexy, like James Dean. - [Buddy] James Dean's a pussy. Probably a faggot too. Rock Hudson is a real actor. - You think he's sexy? - I didn't say that. He's a man's man, somebody that you wanna be with. - Be with? - Yes, hang out with, have a beer with. - Untie my hands and I can help. [thunder rumbling] [gasping] - [Buddy] Do you like that? - Yeah. [sniffling] Want me to touch you? Untie me. I wanna touch you. [thunder rumbling] - Do it. [sighing] - How's that? [sighing] - This what you do to the college boys? Gets 'em all hot? - Oh yeah. Me too. [thunder rumbling] Undo your belt, it'll make you so hot. [belt buckle clicking] [unzipping] [groaning] That feels good, doesn't it? [gasping] Maybe I wasn't doing it right? - [Buddy] I am not one of your college boys. - I'm sorry. - [Buddy] Thought you said you knew what you were doing! - Let me try again. - You know what, I never had trouble with girls before! - I know, it was my fault, I can do better. - That is what they all say. - I'm sorry, I was just trying to make you feel good! - You were trying to get away. - No! - [Buddy] And you used me like all of 'em! - I'm just trying to help! - Oh, you're trying to help? [thunder rumbling] You are not my fucking mother! [screaming] [slapping] [crying] - Please, I'm sorry. [crying] Oh god. I'm sorry! - My old man, the Army shrink, the cops, all trying to help poor Buddy. - No, no, no, please. Please, I'm sorry. - No more! [crying] [slapping] I said shut up! [crying] [gagging] You stupid bitch! [slapping] [crying] - [Kathrine] Please. - Buddy. Well, I made it. I got caught in this downpour and then they didn't have chocolate so I had to get vanilla and it... [suspenseful music] [blowing] What did you do? - [Buddy] She wouldn't shut up. - He doesn't mean half the stuff he says. But he shouldn't have done this to you. I dunno. I never met anyone like him. He's not like the other boys. - He's cruel. - Everyone's cruel sometimes. I bet you've done things you weren't proud of. I bet nothing an apology wouldn't take care of. - He beat me up. - I know. And I'm so sorry. He promised nobody would get hurt. - And you believed that? - You brought this on yourself. - You kidnapped me! - You should just sit still and do as you're told. Now eat some of this food. - [Woman] Haven't you any feelings at all? - [Man] No I haven't, lady. They were taken out of me by experts. - No shit? - Feeling's a trap. Show me a guy with feelings and I'll show you a sucker. It's a weakness, makes you think of something besides yourself. - Yeah and if you don't look out for number one, no one else will. - If I had any feelings left in me at all they'd be for me! Just me. - [Woman] Don't you ever think of your mother, your father? [laughing] - Oh, that's a laugh. - Think of 'em? I used to think of 'em a great deal. - Yeah, 'cause they're worthless. - My mother wasn't married. My old man was a dipso, they left me in a home. A home. - Run by the state! [somber music] [groaning] - You seem like a good person. - I try to be. - Then let me go. - I can't. - I promise I won't get you in any trouble. - I can't do that. - Just untie my hands, I help you if you help me. - Buddy will get upset if I do anything wrong. - He's using you. - No! He loves me. - Celee, he doesn't love you. [chuckling] - You sound like my mama. - She's right. - He has always treated me like a lady. Not like the other boys. And all they ever wanna do is just... - He needs somebody to help him... - No, you don't know him! - And you do? - He is gonna be my husband and we're gonna be happy and we're gonna have a home with a picket fence and everything's... - That's not gonna happen. - No! He loves me and I love him and no one is gonna take that away from me... - For god's sake, Celee... - No! - Just untie me! - You listen to this. Your eyes are like pools. Your mouth like red velvet cake. When I hold you next to me, it makes my sad heart ache. Buddy wrote that for me. What do you think about that? - You're pathetic. [groaning] [gagging] - You reap what you sow! [belt buckle clicking] [groaning] - I didn't mean to... Thank you. - How far along are you? - I don't know what you're talking about. - It happens. - I'm not pregnant. - Your breasts are tender. You're throwing up. You're not hungry. Got yourself in trouble, didn't you? You're not the first. It's not the end of the world. When all of this is over... - This wasn't supposed to happen. - But it did. And now, you've got a little miracle growing in you. The daddy must be thrilled. - He said... He said he loved me. - Then he has to do what's right. [sniffling] - I'd never gone all the way before. - You're a good girl. - We met at a fraternity party. He brought me flowers the first time we went out. He was, he was so polite. - But he really wasn't, was he? - No. No. [sniffling] What's my daddy gonna say? [crying] - He doesn't know? - No. - Shh. [crying] Shh. It's okay. We'll figure something out. Shh. [sobbing] Shh. [sniffling] [crying] Buddy? Buddy? I need to talk to you. - Just a second. [crickets chirping] What's up? - We can't do this. - What are you talking about? - We have to let her go. - Are you nuts? - I'm not. It's just that... What's the matter? - Nothin'. - Well your eyes are all red. - I got something stuck in 'em. Now what the hell are you talking about, Celee? - She's pregnant. We have to let her go. - Are you sure? - It's the right thing to do. Buddy? - Does her daddy know? Well well well, that changes everything. - I know. - I'm gonna call her daddy. - No, you can't tell him. - Celee. Listen to me, her daddy is gonna be thrilled when he hears the good news. - You think? - I know it. Baby, he won't even be mad, this is the best thing that can happen. - And you won't ask for more money, will you? - No, no, not if you don't want me to. - I don't. - Fine. But he should know. Trust me, baby, this is for the best. - I just love you so much that I don't wanna ruin anything. - I know, I know, and I feel the same about you. I really do. Remember? ♪ You're my sunshine ♪ My only sunshine Sing it. ♪ You make me happy All right. - Should we go to the bedroom? - I think we should wait. - Are you sure? - Not that I don't want to. - I know. - I respect you too much. - I know you do. - We just gotta save ourselves. - For the wedding night. - Mm-hmm. It's what God wants. - Will you hold me? - Forever and a day, baby. [sniffling] - Never leave me, daddy. - Don't you worry, baby. It's all gonna work out. [groaning] [suspenseful music] [baby crying] [suspenseful music] - [John] Baby's gonna be fine, sweetheart. - Daddy? - It's all right. Come on, hurry. They'll be back soon. - Daddy! - There's plenty of time though, don't worry about it. - I can't. - Now Kathrine Jane, you need to do as you're told! You know you don't argue with Daddy! Kathrine Jane! [groaning] [crying] [birds chirping] [metal squealing] [chickens clucking] [horse blowing] [rooster calling] [bed creaking] [rotary phone clicking] [phone ringing] - Hello? - How's that money coming? - [John] I got it, you just have to wait until the bank opens. How much would you pay to be a granddaddy? - [John] What are you saying? - In a couple months you're gonna have a little bundle of joy runnin' around. - [John] My daughter's not even married. - Yeah but that didn't stop her from getting knocked up now did it? - [John] Katie's pregnant? - Bingo! So we gotta talk about more money. - [John] Who's the father? - A college guy, I don't know. - Who? - I don't know, some guy that probably lied to her and took advantage of her and won't even do the right thing, you know? - [John] I'll kill that son of a... That's my baby. - I feel bad having to tell you this, Mr. Tremaine. I do, I really do. Why don't you go pour yourself a little drink, that might make you feel better. Calm down a little bit. - Buddy? - I'm gonna call you back. - Who are you talking to? - Oh just an old Army buddy who's, you know, having trouble. So I thought I'd call him and check up on him. - You're so sweet. - What got you up? - I rolled over and you weren't there. - You missing daddy? - Mm-hmm. - Aww. - [Celee] Want some coffee? - Why don't you go check on her and I'll make us coffee? - Okay. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm. [sighing] [rotary phone clicking] [phone ringing] - [John] Hello? - How you doin', Mr. Tremaine? - [John] All right, I'm sorry 'bout that. - Hey, there ain't nothin' to be sorry about, sir. I know this is a shock but we gotta talk about what we're gonna do now. Mr. Tremaine? - [John] How much more are we talking about? - Why would you tell him? - He needed to know so he wouldn't hurt you again. - He's gonna ask for more money! - I told him we can't do that. - And you think he's gonna listen to you? All he cares about is the money! You gotta stop him, Celee! - He's not like that! - Not like what? A kidnapper? Somebody who'd beat up a woman? [sighing] - It wasn't supposed to be like this. I'm so sorry. [sighing] - I can't have this baby. - No matter what, it's a blessing. - What kind of blessing is it to raise a kid alone? - My mama raised me alone and I turned out okay. - I won't be able to show my face in town. - Your daddy has lots of money, you can move... - I don't want this baby! - It is not for you to decide, it is God's will! - God damn it, Celee! - Good news! We're gettin' the money. Are you crying? - It's nothing. We were talking about the baby and I got a little emotional. - Well you can dry those tears 'cause that baby got us a bonus. - You asked for more money? - I sure did. - Why? - Because that's how it works, baby. - Using her troubles to get more money? - Well, yeah, that's right. You gotta find their weak spot and then you go for it! - You promised! - I told you all he cared about was the money. - Will you shut up? - You shouldn't have done that, Buddy. - Hey, I did that for us, baby. - I don't want it! - Well, you know what? It's a little late now. And besides, her daddy was really excited when he heard about the baby. - He's lying. - I told you to shut up! - Call him back, please! - I'm not calling anybody back, Celee, it's done. I'm getting the money at 10. - It's wrong! - It's business! - I don't want it! - Fine, well I'll keep the money, okay? - Buddy, please, we can't! - Get off of me! Nobody tells me that I can't, you understand? [screaming] - Buddy, please! - Why don't you just stay down here with your new best friend? [crying] [lock clicking] - Celee. Celee! [sobbing] - He lied. He lied to me. - Stop crying and untie me, Celee. - I can't! - Do it! [sobbing] For the baby! I can't have this baby because I don't want him to hurt her. - Buddy wouldn't do that, I wouldn't let him. - Not Buddy. My daddy. - No. No. He'd be a little upset at first but that is to be expected because he's your daddy. - He's not like that. - Your daddy will come around. It's his grandbaby. - Celee he's not a good daddy, he's a... On Sundays, after church, we'd have our special time. It was fun, just me and him. He'd buy me ice cream or candy. - 'Cause that's what daddies do. [chuckling sadly] - We held hands and I'd sit on his lap and tell him how much I loved him. - 'Cause you did. - I was six the first time he touched me. [suspenseful music] I laughed because it tickled and he laughed too. He said that was how daddies showed their little girls they loved them! And it was fine. The next time it hurt. [crying] I said, "Daddy, that hurts." - Stop, daddies don't do that! - He kept doing it. It kept hurting, no matter how much I begged him to stop! - No, daddy wouldn't do that to his baby. - He stopped when I got my first period. He said I wasn't a little girl anymore. [crying] Please. Help me. - You swear? [crying] I gotta get you some place safe. [truck starting] That's Buddy. - You gotta stop him. - [Celee] He's gone. - We have to get out of here. - The door's locked! - I can't go back to that house with a baby. - I know. - Help me, please. - I will. - Promise? No matter what, help me get rid of this baby? - I can't do that. - You promised. - I can't! - You know it's the right thing. - It's a sin to even think about it. - It's a sin to let something like that happen again. - I can't listen to you. - God put you here for a reason. - God wouldn't do that. - [Kathrine] He wants you to save the baby. - Why me? - Because you care. - I'm not that strong. - Do you want that baby to suffer? - No. - Like I did? - No, god no. - Then... Be God's instrument. Let God guide you and save us. It's God's will. [suspenseful music] - I can't do all things through him who strengthens me. - Amen. Let God guide your hand. - Let God... Guide my hand. Our Father who art in Heaven hallowed be thy name. - [Both] Thy Kingdom come. Thy will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever and ever. - Amen. - Amen. - [Buddy] Hey baby, I got the money. Celee? - [Celee] The harvest has past. Summer has ended and we are not saved. - What the hell are you talking about? Isaiah chapter eight, verse 20. - What the hell did she do to you? - Help her. - Jesus, what happened? - The baby's safe now. - Is she dead? - You have to help her. [sighing] - I gotta think. - I did what she wanted. I helped her with the baby. And there was so much blood I couldn't make it stop! [crying] - I can't breathe in here. - I covered her, she looked cold. - We gotta get outta here. - But Kathrine needs us. - Okay, we got the money, that's all that matters. - We can't leave her. - She doesn't matter, she never mattered, baby. She saw our faces and we'd have to kill her anyway. - No, I won't leave her! - She's a whore, Celee, she got what she deserved! - She loved her baby. - Who cares? - I do! - You killed her, Celee. - No, I saved her and her baby from her daddy! - What the hell are you talking about? - Her daddy! - Her daddy gave us a lot of money, baby. - He needs to pay for his sins! - And he did! - It's not enough! - Fine, fine, you wanna stay then just stay! - What are you doing? - I'm getting outta here! - We're getting married! - Yeah, in your dreams. - I made plans. - So did I and it never included a nutcase. - No! [squelching] [ominous music] - [Buddy] Celee. [clattering] - I love you. [gagging] I've always loved you. [gagging] But you didn't love me. [gasping] I'll never let you go, daddy. [sighing] - You said nobody would get hurt. But can an Ethiopian change his skin or a leopard his spots? Somebody always gets hurt. See? Your daddy did love you. [crying] She's safe now and so is the baby. Shh. It's all right. Everything's gonna be fine. I'm here. Shh. Everything's gonna be all right. [somber music] [vocalizing]
