I am unemployed. I did not do it on purpose. Believe me. Then why did you came to America? I want to find my father. His name is Soternino Cavallo. He should be here in New York City. Do you know him? I think America is not for you. I do not understand why you give me the money? That you could buy a return ticket. You're nice kid, I'll give you advice. Go back to Italy. You have nothing to do in America. Here you have criminals, poverty and despair. Only in New York lives more than 4 million people. And you hope to find your father? You can spend here all your life and find no one. No! No! I'll find my father. I told you, he is stubborn like a donkey. Shut up, Ralph. I didn't give you permission to speak!

That's all I'm going to explain to you. - But you trust me? - Yes. Then go and return the money. Well, if you insist. But if I offend him? What do I do? You know, how much money I have in my pocket? Not a cent. Nothing at all. I can lend you some for now. No. Never. Peppino, do not worry. You're young, strong, kind. And America is big. Here is work for everybody. - How many people do they need? - Ten. Hey, Peppino! What are you doing here, you idiot? Want to sell yourself for $2.00 and a piece of bread? Hey!

And in a month you will see your Peppino. Come in! And now a word to the poet. Rosita, when I look at you, a fire erupts in my chest. Time flies. We already know each other for a year. For 12 months I breathe only you. My love, it's been 365 days that I love you. Rosita, you're the flame of my soul. Who wrote you this poem? Signed Cavallo named Peppino. / Roberto Murolo "Lo Guarracino" Tarantella about a magical fish Guarrachino / / Neapolitan song lyric «Reginella» - Princess / Come on! Pepino! Pepino! - What are you suddenly darkened? - What's that on your side? Braces. Do not pretend. I'm talking about the gun. Well, what's wrong, baby? - Go away, do not touch me. - Why? - Why? - Look what you've become! You are now working for them. Yes? That's where you have the money. And my gifts and those expensive cars. Don't be funny... Do you think I'm funny? Look at yourself? You have turned into caricature of Ralph. And I thought you would stay the same. Not true. I'm the same as before. Do not say that. No! You become a bandit. Miserable bandit! Come on, Rosita! You do not believe in what you say! Come on! Come on! How many people you killed with this gun? Whom have I killed? You don't understand, I never used this gun? Yes, for now. But you can be a killer at any time! No, go away. I do not want to be with you anymore! Rosita, what are you saying! I love you ...! Come on! Try it! I warn you! If you give me one more slap in the face ... You me ... more never see! So what, you want me to leave? Yes! Get out! What are you waiting for? / Everybody laughs / Who do you think you are? You're the only woman in the world? I can find as many women like you as I want! And when I want! I spit on you! I'm not going to cry! I'll even laugh! Ha-ha! Ha-ha! Here, I'm laughing! / Everybody laughs / What are you laughing at, you idiot? Hello! Rosita Florest don't you want to ride in a car with us? Apparently not. Oh, poor Peppino. Are you sad? Kidding? I am awfully happy. I understand you. I am also sad all the time. All the time alone. Without love. When I was little, I climbed on the roof and threw down the ladder. It gave me a great sensations. And everybody came to comfort poor little Pamela. Then came fireman, just for me. All fussed... Pamela, why do you call this is sad? This is crazyness! Yes, of course, I'm crazy. What are you doing? Stop it! It's not funny. We will die together! It's so romantic! I do not want to die! Pamela, you'll crash the car! - We will die together! - Yes, I do not want to die! Brakes! Oh my god, well, stop it! Peppino, it's remarkable experience! Stop it now! Oh, my God! Oh-oh-oh!! Miss Rosita, did you see the auditorium? - No, what? - Go take a look! - What happened? - Peppino Cavallo bought up the whole room. - What are you going to do? - Perform for this idiot? No! Actually, why not? He wants satisfaction. We'll give him some! Raise the curtain. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you all. Thank you. Thank you. Rosita Flores, you have the most beautiful legs in the world! And you're still an idiot! So, okay? Do you still love me? And you're still an idiot! I love you too! Very much. No, wait! Wait a minute, listen to me. We'll get married today. Or I'll kill myself right in the front of you! Wait, Peppi! Are you crazy! No, I'm not. I am ready to pull the trigger. Can you hear? - I pull it! - Stop! Well, all right... I'll marry you. Swear. I swear. I invite all the viewers as the witnesses! Rosita Flores sweared to marry me! / Mendelssohn's Wedding March / Peppino, but if I told you: "No"? Would you really kill yourself? Rosita, it is just a harmless toy. You don't know anything about the weapon. This gun is not dangerous. It is to protect. - Look! Here... - A! You see? Saint Januarius helps us, even in America. /Mendelssohn's Wedding March/ What are your requests? I want all here to be buried in flowers. To keep things nice. Of course. I want the main table to be in the form of horseshoe. Because Cavallo means in Italian "a horse". A horseshoe should bring good luck to me, my wife and our family. All others will be sitted at other tables. - How many guests? - 300 or 400. I want to arrange everything in a big way. So let's see ... The orchestra will be over there. - Say what? - As you wish. Very good. It's a pleasure to deal with you. A wedding cake will be brought out there. As you wish. Mr. Ralph, glad to see you. Peppino Cavallo, welcome! Please. What are you doing here? I want to give you a wedding gift. I am here only for preparations. I decided to bring you a gift in advance. So, I'll be the first. It's me, with my mother. - Whose wallet is this? - Your father. - He took it out from his pocket when he died. - He drowned in the sea. Peppino, your father was killed. Don Nikolone did it. Here it is. He was cremated more than 10 years ago. I remember your father. Like I've have seen him yesterday. You know, the corpses come here every week in hundreds. But never seen body in this state. He was like a colander. So many bullets passed through him! Vendetta, of course. I think, he was inconvenient to someone. And was given to the wolves of Black Hand. - Can take it with me? - Of course, he's yours. A, it's you! What is it? You forgot to knock. Why did you pull out this thing? You have deceived me. You are a liar! - Killer! - What are you talking about? - Are you crazy! - Now I know the truth about my father. And I know that this is you killed him. All right. Now you know the truth. But you're a man, and should understand. I did not want his death. It's just happened. But ever since you came, I look at you as my own son. I truly love you. I think you're my son. I will always help you. I view you in the course of ... No, Peppino, do not kill me. Have mercy on me. I am a poor old man. I'll make you very rich. All what belongs to me - will be yours. Do not kill me! Do not kill! You know, how we call someone like you in Naples? Stinky shit! Ugh! Can't even die like a man! Ralph, where have you been when I called you? The only time I needed you! Bring me some water. This rascal will be sorry! Tony? Damn you! The entire apartment could go into the air! What are you doing here with your bombs? I accepted your offer. I have nowhere to hide. Police is looking for me again. - You're not happy? - No. I am very pleased. I do not mind going to jail, I'm used to it. But first I need to finish it. And then sit down. See, how beautiful she is? 2 kg of TNT ... This is my response to the slavery in America. Does slavery still exist? Poor guy. You do not understand. You also a slave. And me. We are all slaves. All of us. - Be careful! - What? You almost sat down on the detonator. Imagine what would happen? Okay, I'll go to sleep. I'm a little tired. I hope you do not sleep with a bomb in bed? Yes, come on. Feel like at home. If you are hungry, there's plenty of food. Thanks, I already ate. I was hungry and made a pea soup. I have no teeth. Where did you find peas? There, in the box. It was already crushed. You ate my dad? What is this... I do not understand ... That was stored ashes of my father! Oh, no! ... - Bastard! - Well, hit me! No. I can not hurt my father. Dad ... My dad... My poor dad ... If that would comfort you, I can say that it was delicious. Very tasty. I request a public advocate. Without him, I will not talk. You Peppino Cavallo? I'm not Peppino Cavallo. And I never heard of him. I am Peppino Cavallo. What do you want? Get dressed! Get dressed. You are accused of murder of Don Nikolone. - The murder of Don Nikolone? - Exactly. - The murder of Don Nikolona? - Exactly. Are you crazy? I've never killed anyone. Do you know this? Yes, this is my gun. But I never used it. It was used in shooting. Shooting that killed Don Nikolone. But what shooting? I've never used it! You were seen leaving the office of the victim. The office of the victim... Get dressed! Get dressed. You were seen last night at 8:15 pm near the crime scene. Yes, I was there. But Don Nikolone was alive. I did not kill him. How could this happen? Lie down, Peppino! Down! Peppino? Peppino get out. Peppino! Come quickly, Let's go. Run, run! What is it? You hurt? This is nothing. Just a scratch. Do not worry. Nobody will find us here. It is important to find a place with no police presence. So don't worry, we are safe here. We need only to sit tight. I swear, I did not touch Don Nikolone. I did not shoot him. What is it? What is it? You feel bad? Sorry, I don't feel well. Stop... Stop. Where we are? Next to your house? Well...Thanks God, we came. - I'll see it once again. - What...? - Come on, let's go ... - Hey, Tony? Do not stop. Come here. Wait a minute. What do you want to do? Come quickly. Come on! What happened? What's wrong with you? What is it? Let me have a look. Damn! You're wounded! The bomb was excellent, but the fuse was too short. It is necessary to call a doctor, you loosing lots of blood. Better a gravedigger... - Do not talk nonsense. - I'm not kidding. I'm not kidding... eventually... all die... Life is a pasing thing - What should do I do? - Come on, run. Run, Peppino. You still have the time. Farewell, Peppino. Goodbye ... Tony... You said that it was very important to you. You did not forget... Thank you. I spoke to a lawyer today. Nothing can be done. Minimum 30 years. I do not know. Police has the evidence that he is a killer. You are now a powerful man, Ralph. You are now the new boss. Just one your word can save him. I'm not sure I want this. Help him. I beg you! They really get on my nerves! Every Thursday is a punishment. Come on, come on. Move on. Get out! Get out! Fast! Peppino, have you got a cigarette? Peppino? Are you sleeping? Peppino! Peppino! Murderers! They killed him! Peppino! My love! What they have done to you? Peppino! Peppino! My love! Peppino! Peppi! Peppino? It's not so easy to get rid off Peppino Cavallo. - Peppino! - Rosita! / Song ''O sole mio" - My sun / Subtitles courtesy of YAFI (JAGA BKS)
