Nothing beats a good steak, unless you're a vegetarian and you found out that you ate steak because someone lied to you. In that case, the steak didn't hurt you, the truth did. But this story isn't about the truth. It's about a man. A man who dreamed about buying a home with the girl he loved.

Um, hi, it's Rob, Rob Smart. I'm here to see an apartment. Why you ain't say that, man? Hey, DQ. Are the countertops in there marble? Nah, they're the next best thing thoug Well, the kitchen's really nice. You got tons of space for $1,200 a month Yes, sir. You get a lot of bang for your buck here in Beekstead. Speaking of which, the guy upstairs on the second floor, he's in a rock band. So it gets a little loud sometimes, but they're pretty good, so... It's my girlfriend. Do you mind if I take this? Motherfucker. She is way out of your league, bro. No disrespect. Well, look, if you need anything, just give me a shout. Alright? Hey. Hey. So do you maybe want to meet my parents another night? Uh, why would I want to do that? My parents are a little intimidating and I don't want to scare you off. I appreciate you giving me the out, but I don't need it. And I'm excited that I finally get to meet your parents. And I have a feeling they're really gonna like me. Alright. Well, thanks for being brave. So, are you on your way? What is that? Did you walk into a concert? Oh, Katie, it's just the neighbors. I love you. I'll talk to you soon. Would you like some more wine, Rob? Absolutely. Dear, would you do the honors? You're a tad bit more accessible to him. You got it. Say when. Oh, not too much though. I'm driving. So, Rob, Katie says there's an interesting story on how you two met. I would love to hear it. Okay. Well, my friend Toby hits me up and says "I know this great girl named Katie. You're going on a blind date with her and I'm not taking no for an answer." So our blind date starts, we're talking, I am having the time of my life and Katie's laughing like a crazy person so I'm going to assume she was having a good time. And then Katie notices this guy staring at us. So he comes over and says, "Hey, I think you're supposed to be on a date with me." And then at that moment, I realized that Katie wasn't the Katie I was supposed to meet. I wasn't the Rob that she was supposed to meet. My Katie stood me up. And the thing is, I think it had to be fate because what are the chances of me meeting a Katie that was supposed to meet a Rob? Wow. That is really some story. Well, whoever that other Katie was, she messed up. Rob's been great. You snooze, you lose. Now that we're moving in together, things are just perfect. Hmm. Yeah, I meant to tell you, we've been looking at apartments. So where are you looking? Oh, we saw some really nice places in Beekstead. Beekstead? Oh, that's a great place. To get shot! Dad, it's not. I get it, Mr. Reynolds, Beekstead has its rough spots, I'll admit it. But if it makes any better, Katie and I spend so much time in the bedroom, that we barely go out anyway. Excuse me? Oh. Oh. That was a terrible joke. I'm just saying, we don't go out much. Not that I can afford to anyway. Mr. Reynolds? Call me Julius, please. Julius. Sure. I just wanted to say how sorry I am for those jokes in there. They were insensitive, clearly not funny and definitely not the first impression I want to make. It's okay, Rob. I understand and I accept your apology. You can relax with me. Wow. Wave of relief. It's so hard meeting the parents for the first time. Oh, I hear ya, kid and don't sweat it, we're just people. And besides, I know you're a very nice guy. Thank you, Julius. Don't mention it. I just need you to do me a small favor. Sure, anything. This whole thing with Katie, I'm going to need you to find a way to end it without hurting her too badly. Excuse me? This whole thing with my daughter and you, it's not going to work out. Oh God. It's the jokes. No, it's not the jokes, Rob, it's you. You're the joke. Take a look at Katie and look at yoursel Do you think you're anywhere near her league? You're as far below her station as one can be. I don't know what she sees in you. I know what I see in you, and I see a peasant. You like to tell stories? Write a book. Nice guy? Make a friend. But my daughter doesn't deserve a life lacking in worth in a disgusting apartment in a dangerous neighborhood. By the time I was your age, I had already paid off this whole house and I was looking to buy a yacht. Do you think you'll ever be able to buy a house like this? Never in a million years. Now that's the life for Katie. End it with grace, but end it, you must. ♪ I thought we could be ♪ ♪ something special ♪ ♪ baby ♪ Take my hand, Madam. Ow. Fuck! Oh shit! Watch your head. I'm taking this blindfold off. No please. Just two seconds, two seconds. Rob! Okay. Okay. Okay. That's perfect. And... now! Congratulations! What's going on? Today's the day, baby. We're moving in together. What are you talking about? I bought us a mansion, baby. Rob, we've been looking at places in Beekstead. You're going to tell me you bought a mansion? Damn right, I did. How is that even possible? Well, you know how I had that conversation with your dad? I told you that wasn't a big deal. I know, but he said some things that I needed to hear. I went into work the next day. Rob, I just feel like this was a huge decision and it kind of bothers me that I wasn't a part of it. I just really wanted to surprise you. Wow. Oh, yeah. And it came fully furnished. I think I just found my favorite part of the house. So, I wanted to ask, That thing you said outside about me not involving you, was that a fight? I didn't think it was a fight. I don't know. It was tense. Might've technically been a fight and if it was a fight, we should, you know, make up. Well, maybe it was a fight. Howdy, neighbor. Hi, I'm Rob, Rob Smart. Just moved in. Yeah, I see that. I'm Sydney. Welcome to the neighborhood. Thank you. It is a beautiful place. Oh, it is, it is. A great place to raise a family. My thoughts exactly. How big's your litter? Excuse me? How many kids are you at? Oh, no, we're not up to that, just me and my girlfriend. Oh, well, hot diggity dog. I'm sure she's a keeper. You know, I got to tell Ginnie you guys just moved in. She makes a mean casserole. Well, all right then. Yeah. Um, oh, I should probably get back to the lady. Yeah, yeah. Listen, I hear you, I hear you. I should be on my way too. Alright? Hey. Good luck finding it. Huh? I said, "Good luck finding it." (laugh Finding what? The treasure. The treasure? Hidden in the house. What are you talking about? There's a, you don't know? I don't know what you're talking about Shh, shh. Now look, the last fella that lived in that house was into some sketchy business. I mean, he came to me to try to hide some money from the IRS. I said "No way, Jose, I run a legitimate accounting firm." He started hiding the money in his mattress. And when it started hurting his back, he started hiding it in the walls. I mean, you could hear him knocking all night long and not in the carnal sense, if you get my drift. Wow. What happened to him? Oh, that guy's deader than rock music. Had a coronary the size of a Mack truck. Hey, listen, I will bet you a million that the walls are still loaded with that cash. I mean, it might be worth taking a peek. Well, I appreciate the heads up, but I just dropped 4 mil on this place. I don't think I'm knocking down any wall 4 million? That's a steal, knowing that you could double it with what's in there. Okay. Okay. Well, I gotta get going. So, it was a pleasure. Alright, son. See ya. Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. Hey, let me buy you a drink. You know, the local watering hole is called the Lighthouse Inn. And if you really want to know the truth that's where I really live. So find me there and I'll find you a nice bourbon with your name on it. You got it. ♪ Oh, my pretty baby. ♪ ♪ Oh my sweetie, baby. ♪ ♪ I just can't believe I'm yours ♪ Hey Matt. It's Rob. Right. Sorry. Oh, I was just um testing the acoustics of the room. I have Janet on hold on line one. Great. Put her through. You just press one. You were out for three weeks and already forgot how to use the phone? This is Rob speaking. Hey Rob. Welcome back. You sound better. Well, it's great to be back and I am feeling much better, Janet, let me tell you. Good, because that was a lot of time you took off. Well, it's going to pay you back tenfold, Janet. Great to hear. Listen, I got to ask you something. Shoot. Where the fuck were you this morning? Excuse me? Tenfold? You missed today's fucking meeting. Oh, that was today. I'm sorry, Janet. I've just been so overwhelmed. I don't want to hear you took three weeks off to not be overwhelmed. You can't be doing this, Rob. You're right, Janet. You're right. It won't happen again. I promise. It better not happen again, because this waterfront redevelopment is giving me a fucking ulcer. Everyone's working really hard. I need you plugged in. Well, Janet, your electric bill's about to skyrocket, because I am plugged in and I am running hot. Whatever. Listen, go down to Jason's office. He'll fill you in. I need you to put your heads together and poke as many holes as you can, okay? Your presentation needs to be ready to g first thing tomorrow morning. Absolutely. First thing tomorrow morning, you need to be in the conference room, presentation in hand. I'll be there, Janet. This will be the - Ahem. Hi. Didn't see you there. I have a Paulie Gatto on hold. He says it's urgent. Oh, shit. Ah, can you tell him that I'm in a meeting? Okay. Yes? Hi. Yes. Mr. Gatto says that he insists that you step out of your fake meeting. You told him it was a fake meeting? No, I'm telling you what he said. Oh, well tell him that it's a real meeting. Sure. Amanda, I told you to tell Paulie - Hey Rob. Tell Paulie what? To tell Paulie that my meeting just finished. Hold all my calls. Paulie, you really shouldn't - - Sit down. Now, look, Rob. I'm not going to waste your time. Circumstances have changed. The boss wanted me to come down and let you know that we need the money back by the end of the week. What? No, we had it. Big Sally- Mrs. Salerno. Huh? Mrs. Salerno. She doesn't like to be called Big Sally, finds it infantilizing and condescending I'll make sure it doesn't happen again I was just saying, she gave me the year and - Yeah. Unfortunately that's not gonna work. See the boss's daughter just got accepted to the prestigious Paris Academy of Art. Problem is, it ain't cheap. Paris Academy of Art charges $500,000 a semester. And we're the criminals. So long and short, boss needs 4 million for four years of tuition, room and board. We go through the books, and what do you know? We just gave you 4 million last week. So let's even things out. You give us some money back. We'll make it up to you in some other wa Want a drink? No, I'm okay. Oh, you should have one. So, how's that sound? See, the thing is, I kinda spent the money. Oh, I was really hoping you weren't going to say that. On the other hand, your firm here, they're going to be submitting the bid to be the lead contractor on the waterfront redevelopment. Oh, I don't know. See, I've been out. So I haven't really been brought up to speed. I'm bringing you up to speed. Salerno Construction LLC is going to bid on those contracts and Salerno Construction LLC will be awarded those contracts. Everything's supposed to be finalized on Thursday. So either we get the contracts on Thursday, or the 4 million on Friday. I, I don't know. I don't have that kind of firepower here, so- Don't bullshit me, Rob! You'll figure it out, because if you don't, it actually becomes much more simple. Does it? Yeah, because I'm gonna kill you. I'm gonna pull your fucking teeth out of your mouth, slice you up in little tiny pieces, and when they finally find your carcass floating in the fucking river, you'll be so disfigured, they won't even be able to tell who you were. You got that? Who's she? Wife? Girlfriend. She's pretty. See you real soon, Rob. Have a nice fucking day. Hedge fund guy would scoop it up, but never in a million years would I have thought it could have been you. You really proved me wrong, Rob. Huh? It pains me to admit it, but I was wrong about you. And I apologize for everything I said. Oh, it's okay. No, it's not okay. The thought that I could have driven you away from my daughter, oh, it eats me up. My wife says this is Roman marble. Bam! Sturdy, solid, outstanding. I'm damn proud of you, son. Damn proud. Thank you, Mr. Reynolds. Julius, please. My daughter is in great hands. Look at you two, hitting it off. Honey, your man is a keeper. No doubt about it. Dad. Well, I'll leave you two love birds to it. Why don't you help me find your mother? Yeah, she couldn't have kind of gone far. Mona! We're leaving.

There's my handsome man, looking much better. And now, over to our local news. I'm feeling much better, too. In other news, three bodies were found dismembered at the site of the upcoming Sandy Shores waterfront redevelopment. WHIC News is on the scene, bringing you the latest. Isn't that the project your firm is working on? The police at the moment are not saying anything, but with five more bodies found and rumors they are tied to organized crime, residents worry that carnage might just be the new normal in this waterfront community. While we don't know much, one thing is clear, and that is that Rob Smart is going to die. The only way out of this certain and violent death is going to work and sabotaging that proposal, but the stress is on because if Katie finds out, she is certain to leave him and never talk to him again. With tensions running high, the police commissioner will be releasing a formal statement later this afternoon. Until then, citizens are urged to remain vigilant. Chuck Charles, WHIC News. Rob, what's going on? I can explain. You're sick. Aw. I'm sick? I'm sick. I'm sick. Oh, I'm so sorry, baby. Must've caught a stomach bug. Of course. It's fine. Just take a sick day and I'll take one too. I'm going to kill you. Oh no, actually, I got to go to work. No. You don't. And I'm canceling tonight's reservation. Don't cancel the reservation. It's our anniversary. And really, really I'm not sick. It was a one-time thing. You threw up last night. Who's keeping track? Two time thing. Really, I'm great. I just got to go to work and - Rob. I'm not having this conversation. You're sick and if you're not gonna take care of yourself, then I am. So stop being a workaholic, get back into bed, and if I see you doing any work at all, you and I are going to have a big proble I don't understand. You take one week off for a death in the family, I get it, another week, because your girlfriend took you on vacation to make you feel better, okay. And then another week to move into a house you recently inherited. You promised that would be it. And now you come in late on your first day back, you miss a meeting that we scheduled to work around your schedule, and now you're calling in sick? Are you fucking kidding me? Janet, I'm sorry. I'm honestly feeling under the weather. I don't care if you have Ebola and you're bleeding out your face, I'm here with Jason and he says you didn't even go to his office yesterday, so, what the fuck were you doing for eight hours, playing solitaire? I was so busy that day, Janet, it completely slipped past me. I really tried to give you an opportunity here, Rob. I really did. You know how important this waterfront redevelopment plan is. It is very important, Janet. It is very important. It's very important, Rob. It's too important to be messing this up, I'm sorry. You give me no choice. I gonna have to let you go. Janet. Please no, I have so many ideas They will, they will knock your socks of I promise. Hm, well maybe if you weren't such a fuck up, you'd have the opportunity to express them. Oh shit. Oh shit. Janet, please, I need this job. I need this job, Janet, please. I have worked my whole life for this. I have earned this. You know that I'm a kick-ass salesman. I slipped up. I'm sorry. You want me to break down crying again? You know how much I loved my uncle and now I'm sick. I've been vomiting all over the place. The carpets at the office are gorgeous, Janet. You don't want me ruining them. Honey? Are you working? No. I'm not working. I'm just talking to some friends. Who are you talking to? Oh, it's um, Toby. Oh, how's he doing? He's great. Hi Toby. When am I going to meet you already? I'm starting to think you're avoiding me, you big flake! He says, "Hi." Anyway, love you. Wow. Well, I don't know what the fuck that wa but obviously your second chance went out the window. So if you're not too overwhelmed, you can come into the office at your leisure, pack up your things, and turn in your ke because you're fucking fired. Oh, fuck. Hey, neighbor. Hey. Sydney, right? Righto, brother. Get home from work early? No, took a sick day. Well, you don't look too sick to me. Yeah. It's because I'm lying to you, Sydney. I was fired. And I told my girlfriend I was going to the doctor, but I'm not, because I'm lying to her too. Oh, brother. The truth will set you free. And heck, if that fails, maybe a little bourbon might do the tric Hey, hey, hey, Jo Jo, two more, if you don't mind. Don't look so sad, son. You'll get a new job. It's not just the job. I owe a lot of money to some really bad people. I don't know what to do. If you're that hard pressed for cash. I'm telling you there's a fortune hidden somewhere in that house of yours. You were serious about that. Darn serious. Look, your house is like an ocean and that money is lost at sea. All you have to do is look. I'm not going to tear apart my dream house on a wild goose chase. Nay, nay, nay. If thy wits run the wild goose chase, I have done, but thou hast more of the wild goose in one of thy wits than I am sure I have in my whole five. It's there, kiddo. I'm sure of it. You just need to look. Can I have another, please? Now this one, the zuppa di pesce alla veneziana, what's in that one? Ah, yes. That is a choice assortment of fish in a light tomato broth, highly recommended. However, since it is your first time her I do suggest you try the branzino, it is our award-winning house specialty, The branzino? Absolutely to die for. Alright. That sounds great. And your order, sir. Oh, I'll have what she's having. The branzino, excellent choice. I can take your menus. Honey. You're allergic to fish. I am allergic to fish. Would you like to change your order, sir? Oh, um, I will have the chicken. As previously mentioned, we have two chicken options this evening We have a roasted chicken - The roasted chicken's fine. Very well. Your menus. Honey, I, I want to talk about something that's been on my mind. Shoot. I know you've had a big week and maybe it's nothing, but I can't help but feel that something is off. Off? I don't think so. It's just that since you met my parent and you had that conversation with my dad - I promise, everything's good with your dad. Great guy, seriously. Well, if there's anything else that's going on, that's too much for you, you can tell me You know that, right? I love you and I want to be here for you in any way that I can be. Katie, I want to tell you everything. And I already have. Okay. I trust you. I have to go to the bathroom real quic I'll be right back. Why didn't you tell her the truth, Rob? Because then she would leave you, asshol But you owe her the truth. You gotta tell her the truth, man. Okay. Let's do it. Hey Rob, is there room for one more? What are the chances we end up in the same restaurant on the same night? That's a rhetorical question, Rob. The chances are high. This is Mrs. Salerno's place. Mrs. Salerno owns this restaurant? Mrs. Salerno owns this town. So, if could spare a moment of your time Mrs. Salerno is having dinner in the bac and it'd be quite rude of you not to say, "Hello." Oh, I really wouldn't want to interrupt her dinner. Please, Rob. I insist. Mrs. Salerno, you remember Rob? Oh yeah. Oh wow, Rob. Oh, Robert, welcome. This is my daughter, Tori. Tori, say, "Hello" to Robert. Can I be excused? Of course. So now listen, Robert, how are you? Do you have the food here yet? No, I just ordered. Ah, everything here is delicious. What did you order? I got the roasted chicken. Oh, the roasted chicken is shit. He's going to have the branzino. You're going to love it. I promise. I promise. You're going to eat every bite. Well, come on, sit down, take a load off So you know, we just wanted to check in, yeah, take a moment of your time and make sure that we're all set for tomorrow's delicate negotiations for the waterfront redevelopment contracts. We're on track. Everything's as good as handled. Oh, look at that. Aye, aye. Good as handled. Oh, shit! This was a test and you failed because you're stupid. I have your balls in a vice and you chose to lie to me. I know that you were fired from your job this afternoon, because... I have ears, eyes everywhere, you fuck. You stupid motherfucker. So now the vice tightens. What is that sharp feeling you got there Motivation! That's what it is. I was already motivated! Yeah, well, a little more never hurt. Maybe in your case it does. Doesn't it, Rob? You're going to get a phone call in two days. You are not gonna want to miss that call and you're gonna want to have my money when you answer. Great. Oh, God. Great. All right. A a a ah! Hey, you were in there for awhile. Are you still feeling sick? Really long line. At the men's room? That's crazy. The branzini. Oh, there's been a mistake. But this is compliments of Mrs. Oh, no, no, I wanted this. I really wanted to try it. But you're violently allergic to fish. I don't think that I am. I'm good. Trust me. Enjoy your meal. Look, look at this. Mmm. Mmm. See? I'm totally fine. Well, the good news is the anaphylaxis has responded to the medication and is calming down quite a bit, but you really should not be eating fish, Mr. Smart. I don't know if you know this, but you are deathly allergic to it. He does know this. Rob, what were you thinking? Gotta live dangerously, sometimes. In my professional opinion, you should not. Thank you, doctor. You're welcome. I also looked at that a dog bite on your leg and I must say it is highly irregular. You got bit by a dog? Dog bites usually present as multiple puncture wounds, but this looked more like someone stuck a steak knife in his leg and twisted it. Yeah, Doc. That's exactly what it felt like. That dog's teeth, they were sharp. Like I said, unusual, but no matter. We cleaned it up. We gave you a rabies and tetanus shot, antibiotics, CT, and MRI, with and without contrast, the works. Well, it's a good thing your job has such great health insurance. I can't even imagine what all of this would cost. Yeah, big time. But if the insurance company is paying, why pinch pennies, right? It is your life on the line, but I'm sure you'll be fine. You'll be discharged in just a few days. Oh no, Doc, I need to check out tonigh I will let you two discuss. Baby, I just want to go home to our beautiful house. You're not going anywhere. The doctor just said that you shouldn't This is totally ridiculous. Look at me. I'm fine. You don't look fine at all. You look like a pufferfish and you didn't tell me that a dog bit yo I always look like a pufferfish. Let's just get out of here. We're not going anywhere. You could've died. Okay. You want to stay? We'll stay. Whoa, Nelly! What happened to you? I know. It was an allergic reaction. But I need to talk to you about the money that's hidden in the house. If you help me find it, I'll give you a piece of it. Oh, it's not necessary, friend. I have all the riches a man needs, but I appreciate the offer. Now, first order of business, I'd start by taking down those walls. Any idea which rooms? Oh, geez, the amount of sheet rocking this guy was doing over the span of years, I mean, best bet, all of them. This cat had a lot of cash. You better get yourself some tools. Okay. Where am I supposed to get tools at two in the morning? Hey, excuse me. Any chance you know where the tool - Hey, excuse me. Any chance? Hey, how's it going? Benadryl's aisle two. Thanks. Any chance, do you guys carry power tool No. Uh, do you know anywhere I can get some tools? Hardware store. Are any open now? No. Look, you gotta have like a sledgehammer or a power saw or something somewhere. Um. This is a pharmacy. Please. You're the only place that's open for miles. If I don't get my hand on some tools, I'm gonna die. My boss has some in the back. I'll sell them to you. Really? That'd be amazing. All right. 500 bucks. You got it. Show me the money. Oh shit. I don't have my wallet on me right now, but could you spot me and I'll come back tomorrow. No, I know this is strange, but please, this is an emergency. All right. You want to play this game? I'll play this game. I want to speak to your manager. I'm the manager. Really? Yeah. Is there anything I can do to get you to change your mind? Yeah. Take your fucked up face and leave my fucking store. Hey guys, can I speak to you for a second? Look, man, look, I don't know what you think you saw back there but we definitely wasn't doing whippets. Yeah. I mean, it's medicinal purposes for the both of us. We got cards. I need your help. Yo, what's wrong with your face? Benadryl is in aisle two. I forgot my wallet and - Let me stop you right there, G. We ain't got no cash. Okay. I wasn't asking for any, but before I saw you shoplifting - Whoa, that's mad accusatory, man. Let me stop you right there, chief. We ain't steal shit. I just need you to steal some tools from me that are in the back. Yo, are you a cop? Are you trying to set us up? No, I'm not a cop. Prove it. Show us you're not wearing a wire.
