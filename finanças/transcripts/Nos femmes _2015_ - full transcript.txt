Every summer without fail, Max, Simon and I had a few days away as single guys. Wkhom our women. Yes, as single guys. We wouldn'! hale missed it for anything. Our return to nature, to the wild. .. Not that wild. We rested body and mind... But had fun too. Like a son of retreat. A retreat is too monastic. We got some distance. - Exactly. - So the spot had to be... Distant. Yes! - A place made for introspection » Exactly. A place to meditate. I just said that - A form of personal hygiene. - We“ said! The three of us were one. Never a problem. Never a single cloud. We were good together We were made for each other. - We matched. - A great friendship is like a great love. Yeah, but without the hassle. 'l'lll next year, if all goes well. I hate fine word's but, for 35 years now, it': true that, well. .. And then there was that... That event. - It wasrfk an event. - k was. A serious one. I! was a drama, m I ca}! k a tragedy. A shock. Not a shock, a tragedy. Something tragic makes k a tragedy. OUR WOMEN Mrs. Préwlin, room 'I. Mrs. Stella Prévin, room 7. You're seeing Dr.Andre'ani. Hello. A leaky flush is annoying, dripping every half-second... The noise drives me mad personally. - Where's Dr. Andréani? - That's me. Who needs a plumber? Let me see your X-rays. Maxis a top radiologist. Bull must say he can be a little too frank with his patients. Not a pretty sight. But it's not built to last forever. It must hurt. I know... But it won'! get any belter. Hopeless. Paul is a top meumakologist. Bu'! he tends to be overly optimism. - That doesn't hurt. - It does! Not at all, Mrs. Prévin. You'll be running around again soon. You said that two months ago. It's hopeless, even the radiologist says so. Nonsense! Here! Simon started out doing shampoos and rum. .. He owns two booming hair salons. I'll fetch him. Simon, Ms. Figari is here. Good. I'd cut it short, very short. A nice, short brush cut. Beautiful! We'll do a few highlights. You did some last week. Just a few, like a brief splash of sunlight. Are you sure? If I like you that way, all other men will too. Ok then. Simon's flaw is that he confuses customers and conquests. Just like takings and profits. But that': his problem. Paul drives everywhere. I think that explains his back pain, but he says not. Maxis a cycling freak. In all weathers, his bike, always his bike. Simon feels he pays so much tax he can use the bus lanes. - I never understood that. » Forget n. Shit! Karine! Honey! Estelle! Honey! Fatima! Karine? Are you here, honey? Paul L's maxriedto Karine. He has a daughter, Pascaline, 22 and a son... - Antonio? Pascaline? Pascaline? - Revising? - Yes. - Seen your mom? - Shes probably sleeping. - Hi, Fatima. - Hello, Mr. Max. Why are you vacuuming? I do the vacuuming. I finished early so I thought I'd do it. I said your X-rays show ifs bad for your back. Let me do it. I like to do the vacuuming. Too kind. I like doing it too. Max lives alone. He': a demanding romantic. He seeks the ideal woman, meaning his affairs never last long. Go home now. The only woman that he has stuck with is his cleaner. If all bosses were as kind as you... Karine is a discreet and retiring homebody. Going to bed already? She enjoys a good book her bed and peace. - Isn't it a bit early for bed? - No. - When did you eat? - A! 7. And... What did you eat? An apple. So whafs new? Nothing. The kids? Fine. I think. I'm going to Max's. I'll probably be back late. Fine. I'll be asleep. Well then... I'll be going. - No buzzer? - I used it. - You did? - Yes. I never heard it. - Is Simon here? - Not yet. There... Who says I'll agree? You make me laugh. Where the hell is he? We spoke earlier. He'll be here. - Call him. - No, you. I'll only get mad. What's the msh? Ifs not that. 9 means 9. 9:05, 9:10, or you let people know you'll be late. We're not “people”. Know what I think? He fought "with Estelle. They had all day. - Maybe she wanted him to siay in. - Who cares? He can stay in and fight if he wants. She's a real drag. - She's a bit rigid. - No, she's a total drag! Ok, things aren't great for you... They're not? Magali... What about Magali? Ifs over. What? It isn't over. She moved om. So? We have our ups and downs. You've no patience, no diplomacy. You get your back up, even if you love her. I just play it by ear. I'm not swamped "with offers so I'm nice to her. I make a huge effort, but then it goes off the rails. She makes a scene over anything. Like when I said Claude Nougaro was irreplaceable. - I agree with her! - Fine! You can think the exact opposite but you can respect my opinion. “You only like dead singers!” - Is it my fault he's dead? - No! You're in shape though, that's obvious. - Me? - Yes, you. - You're happy. - Yes, thank you, I am. An easy life with the kids... Yes, life is peaceful. But, then again, our relationship's less dynamic now. The drawbacks of peace. VUith Magali, it's the drawbacks ofwar. If I go om alone, she decides I'm cheating on her. That's why we stopped living together. But we're still a couple. You do things backwards. You live together, then split up, but you're still together. It must be confusing for her. When I had an evening outwith you, she'd wait up. Unlil 2 a.m., wide-awake. She'd smell me. Smell you how? With her nose. She'd sniff me. - Trying to detect perfume or soap. - Soap? Some guys take showers after. The idiots. After seeing your pals, who smells of soap? Bu! you, you've never... Never. Not even half a time. I've had more women than most bu! never two at once. For Magali, jealousy isn't a disease, it's a second skin. She thrives on suspicion. I have to admit I'm lucky on that level. Karine is pretty relaxing. She isn't at all suspicious. It never even crosses her mind. Good for you. You know me. I'm not like that. I follow my route. I'm not bragging. In all these years, ifs never been that tough. And, to be honest, the opportunity never arose. Bu! if it did... If I! did... No patients? Come on, there are professional ethics. I'm not a barman in a swingers' club! Too bad. Besides, at the age I've reached, forget it. I'm more worried about Pascaline finishing medical school. She goes out instead of studying. She's pretty, she's popular... Shes been elusive lately. I have the feeling shes... Can'! you call Simon? There you go. - Ifs Magali. - Not answering? My cell's off. I don'! want calls on the landline. Hello. MaxAndréani. Message. You're a drag. I talk more to your voice-mail than to you. I had something important to tell you but... it's absurd. I wonder if there's any sense in it. See you. Be nice, call her back. Shit, Simon, we said 9, you're 50 minutes late! Had a problem? Where have you been? - What's up with him? - No idea. Hey, Simon! - At least he's here now. - Come on... Just look at him. Simon... What's wrong? You had an accident? Speak up a bit. I killed Estelle. We won'! buy that! I killed her! Estelle? You killed her? Why? Where? How? At home, just now, "with my hands. - VUith a knife? - I strangled her. - What's that? - Cherries. - You must have dreamed it. - No, I didn't. He's been drinking. He can'! take it, he's raving. I swear ifs true! You're not the violent type. Not at all. You've never hurt her. You have? Come on, cut the crap now. Bu! ifs true! Shit! We fought, I strangled her. I'd never raised a hand to her. But I was beside myself. I squeezed and "when I let go... Shh... This is a nightmare... A nightmare! You're sure she's... Shit! Why me? - What do we do? - I've no idea. - Where is she? - He killed her. Mmeret her body? He hasn't held a funeral yet! Simon, "where is she? There... On the living room rug! You lefl her and walked out? - Give me a pill. - What? I feel like hell! This is all I have. Careful, Ts strong stuff. That's way too much! Spit them back out! - I feel like hell! - spin WGod... How could you? - How could you? - As if I knew. - How could he? Strangling takes time. - What? Squeezing a woman's neck takes time. You have plenty of time to realize 'what you're doing. Well, I didn't! Estelle... Sorry to ruin your evening. The fight... What caused it? No... I like to take time. Ok, lots of love. I'm disturbing you. - I didn't hear you. - I "was quiet. - Who was that? - A girlfriend. Sure... I'm a complete idiot. Withheld number, obviously. You're as paranoid as ever. - So who is she? - Give me a break. I'm happy with my account! Get lost! I'm not stupid, 0k? I'm going out tonight. - Who Wilh? - Friends you don'! know. Always friends I don't know-v. Come and you will. You'd be pissed if I did. That's true. Tell me you who were calling! Whafll you do? Beat him up? - I beat up your sluts? - What sluts? You're being a drag. No one talks to me like that! I'm so scared! Who were you calling? You're bmising me! Theyll pay less! Do that again and I'll kill you! Backhand, forehand... You know, he has a case. Seriously? Why not call it self-defense? Someone slaps you, you slap them back, unless ifs a woman. He didn't beat Estelle. He's not violent. The fight just took a bad tum. A bad turn is when you push someone and they hit a wall. Bu! strangling is strangling. Sure she didn't just faint? - You tried to revive her? - Of course. Estelle! Shit! Why didni you call the cops? In a case like this, you call the cops. - Want us to do it? - No! Yes, you have to go to the police. An ambulance is no use. - Ifs the police now. - No! You introduce yourself, you tell them calmly... Calmly means he doesn't regret it. So tell them regretfully 'what happened. We'll back you up and tell them mmat we know. - What do we lmow? - Well, that... That their relationship was antagonistic, tense, tough... Everyone will agree she was moody. We'll back you up. We'll side with you. I don't deserve to go to jail. You'll go, but you won'! stay. Don't lie. He'll stay until the trial. 1B months maybe. His sentence could be the time in custody. That happens. Maybe, "with a very good lawyer. A star! A nitpicker! A schemer! A guy mmdll make him the victim. Come on! There are campaigns on battered women every year! Posters, photos, films! I'll have the press and feminists against me! I'll get 10 years! 10 years is a lot but you know ifs only 10 years on paper. You can earn yourself an early release... Besides, she's dead. Be brave. I'm not brave! I don't want to be! So ma?“ you do'? - Got a smoke? - You quit! I killed my wife, I need a smoke! Sorry, got none. So ma?“ you do'? No idea. Try to make your mind up. - You want to run? - Where? - Run! - I heard the first time! Run "where? Overseas. A place with no extradition treaty. You're crazy! I understand him not wanting to go to jail. V\Iho'd warn to? Drugs, gangs, dealing, attacks in the showers... We can't do that. We have morals after all. We help him but not any old how. I'll criticize Estelle because she deserves R Bu! I won'! help him mn. I don'! want to run! My life's here! I have two hair salons, a house with a pool after 25 years, three cars, mo garages, a yacht! I can'! just take off! Come back down to earth! You killed your wife, the person who shared your life. We can say mmat we like, but she was your wife. You didn't kill some burglar who came to rob you. You want to help? Sure. We want to help. Right, Paul? We want to help. Of course. - When had we agreed to meet? - A! 9. I arrived at 9. Say that again. I arrived at 9. If I arrived at 9, they can never suspect me. Say it again. I arrived at 9. If I arrived at 9, they can never suspect me. Estelle died at 9:15 or 9:20. So if I arrived here at 9, I can'! be... lfl lefl hometo be here at 9... To be here at 9... To be here at 9... I'd have had to leave at... 8:30 at the latest - You warn us to lie? - About 45 minutes?! Ifs not a lot. - Incredible! - You can'! ask that. I wish I didni have to ask but I'm asking. Max, what do you say? Nothing! You dump this on me. I'm saying nothing. I'm reeling in shock. - Shit, we're friends! - Yeah, 0k, we're friends... Bu! friendship has its rules. You can set limits, a frame... Friendship doesn't allow you to do just anything. This kind of thing could happen to anyone. Not true. When I get mad,I raise my voice. If ifs bad, I punch the door. And if it's worse, I get some air. But that's all. I control myself. Or you're mad. I feel the same way. Estelle's dead and we have to lie. Let me deal with it all. What I did is unforgivable. But I won't rot in jail. So I'm warning you... I'll kill myself and you'll be responsible! - Seriously? - Blackmail! You can'! dump me now! Do you realize what you're asking? I know. it's not easy. What if you were seen? I mrasdt. - How can you know? - I checked. The house is totally isolated. You know the place. No one ever passes by. How about here? What? It wasni 9. You'd need to have a neighbor Who notes on all the comings and goings. That's a risk! Yes, there are people like that! If you tell the cops I arrived on time, they won'! check. He's not wrong. - Count me out. - What? Count me out. Great. God, you disappoint me. Your disappointment can't equal mine. - Max... - Let's respect each other. We're free to decide, but I say, “Niet.” You've started by expressing your view. We'll do the same and then discuss it. It could've happened to you! Max, you and Magali always fight! Didn't you ever feel you could hurt her? Sure. But it always remained a fantasy. The things I could've done, bu! held back - And you, Paul? - I'm not like you. Marriage doesn't give you every right. You have a right to a little privacy. I respect my wife and respect is a matter oftmst. What K Karine cheated on you? I wouldn't be pleased. I'd be very disappointed. I'd probably react badly, but not violently. Ifs not in my DNA. I'm a doctor, I mend, I don't destroy. Me too. I mend as well. You mend? I'm a radiologist. I mend a little. Why did I turn to such perfect people? I never said I was perfect! Ifs my opinion. Covering for you won'! necessarily help you. Could you live "with that on your conscience? I reckon not. Paul... I'm thinking. Do you mind? Don'! pressure me! I'll lie to protect you bu! if they prove you did it, my life collapses! Whafll collapse? You'll have just helped an old friend! If ever they corner me. You'd pin it on a stranger? Sure. Why not? Listen... We had a break-in three years ago, remember? They got into the house in the night and we never heard a thing upstairs. Imagine R happening again, "with Estelle alone at home this time. Not credible? You asked before and I told you. You want me to tell you again? Same answer. Friends like you... Thanks a lot. Me... I thought a true friend was someone you could call at 3 a.m., to say you'd committed a crime, and who'd help you bury the corpse. But your wife's corpse isn't the same thing. I knew Estelle. And I liked her. What?! Did you hear, Paul? Talk about Mia-faced! Just now, you were criticizing her! - He was, wasn't he? - He was. Sorry, you said she deserved to be criticized. So we just need to get rid of all the unpleasant people on Earth to clear the air. If being your friend means condoning your killing impulse or applying suchjustice, no way! He has a point. This is tiring. Take a stand and stop agreeing with everyone. My position is simple: you're right. And... And he has his reasons. That's typical, that is! Go for consensus! - You always try to unite everyone! - I do. But you divide. Because you're divisive, Max! Who's ma? - The door. - But who is it? Expecting someone? What is it? Your dinner. What did he say? - I ordered pizzas. - What for? - For dinner. - Right, silly me. Simon? 36.50 euros, please. I'm in here! I'm in here, dammit! Open up! Owen up, will you? “Ma? going on? I thought it was the cops. I was stuck. There's no handle. Careful, they're burning hot! - What did you get? - A mix for everyone. Margherka... Veggie... - And ham and cheese. - We can'! eat now! For the wine... I have an Angélus 2006 or we stay off the drink... - I'm in pain! - Where? The lumbar vertebrae. L4, L5. - Sit down. - That makes it worse. Know what? You need to stretch. Cross your legs like this and slowly reach down to the ground... - it's no use. - How about ice? It won'! help. Can you take a look? - Could you... - Lean forward. - L5? - That's m ~ L4? ' Yes! I'll do you some X-rays next week. - Let me ask you a question. - What? Remember mmat happened twelve years ago? When you decided to open your radiology practice? Do you remember? Fantastic! You'll get filthy rich! Maybe, bu! I'm up to my neck in debt. L('ll Work. Food and medicine always do. You know what I did? A check. You told me before. 50,000 until your first income. A check for 50,000 euros. 50,000 euros? BQKéS. - I adore her. - What a slut. You never asked. I lent you 50,000 euros. I insisted on signing an IOU and paid back every last cent. What did you do "when you took the checK? - Maybe I gave you a kiss. - Yes. You hugged me and that surprised me. I didn't use my tongue! You can't compare a loan "with perjury! Giving is giving. Bu! you count what you give. Max, that money I lent you I didn't have it. So, according to you, friendship is insurance against mishaps. We have a good time, play cards, lend each other money... we “contribute” and so we're covered. - He didni say that. - He did. I'm just asking you to say... This wine is exceptional. Especially the 2006 vintage. What's up with him? He's not going to croak too. What's wrong? What is it? A stroke? - A stroke? - No idea, I'm a rheumatologist! A coronary? Come back, Simon! - Calm down. - Call an ambulance. There's no need. He's dead? No, he downed that booze, plus all those tranquilizers. It'd knock out a rhino. He won't tap-dance now-v. Come on, let's get him to the bedroom. We'll unbutton his... God, he weighs a ton! Ouch, I bumped my nuts. Simon didn'! wake until the next day. It was just us two. Yes, and we had to make a tough decision. Especially tough as we weren'! sure of what he 'd fold us. Well? No. - No? - I don'! agree. Because you've decided not to agree. Sorry, the crust was too thick, the seasoning average, the ham too dry... It wasni inedible. I ate it. Bu! you can'! compare it to my pizzas. True. - Warn some more? - No thanks. My diet... - Doing the dishes? - I can'! leave them. No cleaner tom orrow? Yes, but I do this belter than her. - It won'! take long. - Need a hand? Don'! move. It relaxes me. It relaxes you? I like the place tidy. And I prefer to do R. Why have a cleaner'? Because I've had her 15 years... Done 'while we were chatting. Ifs not right to have such a bad back. - You're the expert. - Cobbler's children and so on. VUith me, it's the thighs. When I squat down, I get like ajolt... - Up your back? - Everywhere. Pins and needles too. What could it be? Hard to say. Call my secretary for an appointment. “Call my secretary for an appointment.” Still asleep? Can'! you hear him? - Thought it over? - Yes. Well, no. And you? I'd call the police. The police? Now? When then? Refusing to testify, fine. Bu! now you'll call the cops? Not lying means telling the truth. Which means denouncing him it's logical. Staying silent means lying. Not at all, staying silent isn't lying. When they ask us mmat time he arrived, if we tell the tmth, 9:50, "which isn't denouncing him... He could've been elsewhere "when Estelle "was killed. Next question. What was your friend like? What state was he in? Did he say anything? How'll you answer? I've no idea how I'll answer. Calling it a normal evening is a lie. Simon told us everything in detail. When he did ii, how he did ii and why he did ii. I'm being totally logical. I need to... You're going too fast. - What do you suggest? - Not shopping him to the cops anyhow. He won'! even realize he's being arrested in that state. So they lock him up and we've done our duty? Great! Think I'm pleased? Half of what we do is done out of duty, not our of pleasure. We're talking about Simon! We can'! be so categorical. So he has mitigating circumstances? Of course he does! First of all, he's my friend. Mine too. Yours, I'm not so sure. But he's mine! Second, and more objectively, he acted on impulse. He had no motive to kill her. Fine, he acted on impulse. That's worth noting. No one's denying it. But that's his lawyeflsjob. We'll get him the very best and it'll act in his favor. You know even the very best lawyer can'! work miracles. Simon 'will confess to the crime. That'll settle everything. A wife-killer is a total scumbag. Yes or no? - Yes. - Simon isn't a scumbag. - What? - I wouldn't be so sure. The least we can say is we're seeing him in a new light. A new light... But he never killed anyone before. He told us right away. Exactly, he told us. Bu! Why? Why did he tell us? Why? Maybe because he needs us. He kills his wife and then what? He comes straight here. Doesn't that bother you? On top of easing his conscience, he came here to find an alibi. And, before he lefl, I'm almost 100% sure he erased any incriminating evidence. If we follow your thinking, you're saying it was all premeditated? That's a serious accusation. You think he's manipulating us? That he's using us? It's odd, strangling your wife then going to play poker with pals. It shows he maintained some cornrol of events. Ok, he says he lost his mind and so on. But he didn't realty lose it. The idea of claiming he arrived on time and not 50 minutes late wasni your idea or mine. It was his! He asked us to say that. You think he thought of it before gelling here? Who knows? You think he really meant to kill Estelle? I don't know. I'm weighing up every possibility. But we're talking about Simon! What's that supposed to mean? Let's have some hard facts, please. We know him. Weak. inadmissible. We only know people so far. Not after 35 years. After 35 years, I've realized Simon is smart and intelligent with next to no scruples. He's done so well 'cos he knows how to use others. You're envious? It's just an observation. I'm not envious. Estelle may have every flaw possible. - Bu! is he spotless? - Concerning? What he accused her of. Infidelity? He's strayed at times, but he's known some rough patches. You're complacent. I'm not complacent, but you're so radical! He's strayed, so be it. But in such a problematic relationship, you need to let off steam now and then. Let off steam?! He could never resist a woman. At any opportunity. And he had plenty through his work. Don'! be so stubborn. You know who we're dealing with. Use your mind. I use my mind... and my gut too. Me too! Not equally! Too bad! Maybe he's been bullshitting us. What do you mean? He was drunk. I won'! go in. I don'! warn to see her corpse. You've seen corpses before. I've signed burial permits, but I hate that. I just want to check ifs true. - Convinced now? - What do we do? We split. Shit! - The cops? - Who else flashes like that? Maybe it's an emergency doctor. Slow down. Ifs no doctor. - Maybe they're not after us. - Speed up. - Yeah? - Speed up! - Shit! - Pull over! They've seen your plates now. Leaving the scene, failure to report a crime, collusion. We'll get 15 years thanks to your bullshit! Why did we even go? Turn signal on? Let me do the talking. You lie to the cops, fine. What about Karine? Or Pascaline and your son? Whafll you tell them? The same version as the cops. I can't tell my family I was an accomplice to murder. Spare me that look. Karine and I don'! share the same brain, 0k. - Have you ever lied to her? - Of course. Loads of times. Loads of times? Of course I lie. Don'! you? Well I do. I'm an excellent liar. If Karine learns what Simon did, she'll be heartbroken. And? I don'! warn that, so I'll lie to her. And you could carry on seeing Simon as usual? Play poker "with him? Go out for dinner? Clown around? Laugh at his jokes? Great. It won't be like before. I can't see the future. This thing he did is appalling, terrifying, horrible! - I'm lucid. - Good! But friendship is also forgiveness. True friends would've talked him out of marrying Estelle. We reacted too late! - Remember your first impression? - I do. Excellent. And mine? Disastrous. I hated her before she even spoke. She wore a (on of foundation, a leopard-skin pussy-flasher and Simon got off being seen "with her, groping her in front of us. “She's a bomb, I'll marry her! She'll give me children!” How did I react? I don'! remember. "Why are they together?” - What did you say? - I forget. “Come on, they're in love.” - I said that? - You said that! Believe me, they were never in love. Neither one! She married him for his money. And he married her to impress us. So we'd say, “Shit, how did Simon land that hottie?” He married her 'cos he has to show off to exist! He only helped me out to play Mr. Generosity. He's acquired nothing for his own pleasure, bu! solely to impress others. Us! Where did it get him? She cheated on him, busted his balls, blew his dough, gave him no kids and he ended up icing her! - Terrific! - We're talking about Simon! In his shoes, you'd 'want us to ponder things. You have convictions. Congratulations! Bu! we're human. Things aren't black and white. For pitys sake... This heartfelt indulgence of yours is worse than the crime you defend! I'm not defending it, I just pity Simon! He's more than what he did. It'd be simpler if he was a serial killer. It'd be settled by now. Bu! ifs a bit more complex. Consider all the parameters. Parameters? What parameters? He lent me money over 10 years ago... He cuts your hair for free... Are those your parameters? Know what? You conceal your weakness. You cloak it in wimpy, generous, pseudo-humanistic words but the truth is you're scared. You're scared of reading, of acting, but you're above all scared people will remember you denounced a friend! Friendship is noble, denunciation is ugly! You believe those crap cliches. I have to tell you, denunciation can be useful, necessary and at times even charitable. You want me to admire your stand and praise your scruples. Sorry, but I can't. You're acting generous when, in fact, you're avoiding the issue You're fleeing, you're running away, you're beating a retreat! Shit, Max, stop bellowing! Aloud voice doesn't make you right. I have a loud voice too! I can yell too! And even louder than you! For an hour now, you've been explaining good and evil, the right reactions and opinions. Ifs a drag! Every time you open your mouth, the gospel comes pouring om! The gospel according to Max! You're no gospel. You talk a load of crap! These last 35 years, I don'! agree with everything you say. I pretend 'cos I don'! warn to fight, but I don'! agree! It's worse "with the years! You're not aging, you're worsening! Look at the place you live in! Nothing om of place! Ifs cold, ifs empty, ifs gloomy. There's no life here! Do you listen to yourself? For you, women are “females”! What do you know about them, you've never managed to hold onto one! You never answer your phone 'cos you're not at the disposition of any asshole who calls! To see you, we have to send you an email! You listen to your music on vinyl! Music on a computer? No, never! Horrendous! That's sacrilege! And you only like dead singers! Your record collection is a cemetery! Trenet, Brel, Brassens, Ferre', Ferrat, Mozart, Pavarotti, Nougaro! I hate Nougaro! I loathe Nougaro! I like living singers 'cos you don't! I like soccer 'cos you don't! I like TV 'cos you don't! I like everything you hate and hate everything you like! 'Cos you've been pissing me off for 35 years, Max! You piss me off! You're a pain in the ass! In the fucking ass! Coffee? Please. - Sugar? - No, as it comes. Sweetener? No thanks, nothing. Macaroon? I'm 0k. You know, Paul... it's not... it's not quite like that. What? That image... “things were better before?... the wofld's going to the dogs”... the vinyl albums... Email and all that... I'm not just an old fart. I like rap. Sorry? I like rap. Rap? Not just dead singers. I like rap too. Don'! believe me? Look. - Never heard of it. - It's fantastic! Yeah? Just you wait and see. I'll stop so I don't wake him. Good, huh? Yes, ifs... When was this taken with Magali? I forget. Six years ago. You look good, both smiling. We'd just met. Where are things now? If you want the latest update... She gave me notice. Notice how? She moves in or ifs over. Shh... She tells me I have to make my mind up. Unless I call her by Monday, she says ifs over. That's rough. We agree. Whafll you do? I want to dump everything. There you go. What? You're off again. Lighten up a bit, Max. A relationship isn't hard science. What you want doesn't exist. My parents... They exist, right? At BB, they hold hands and are in love till their dying day. An example like that sets the bar higher. So all couples are bound to fail? Take the examples around us. What's it like for others? Things are rocky, laborious, chaotic... And can come to bad end. - Should I live with her again? - Honestly? If I call and agree, it'll look as if I'm giving in. So give in! It'll be a change for you. We fight when she's here, but I miss her. We had ten days away in July. It was hell. We went away to rest. On vacation, 0K? The word vacation has several different definitions. For Magali... You don'! travel 5,000 miles to sleep. Come on, move! Come on! She wanton hikes m crazy places with a huge backpack... High-altitude running hot-weather running... And that': not all. Scuba-diving, with coral and exotic fish. .. She was just doing her own thing? No. I had to foffovu. “Why be together otherwise?' Work had wiped me out. I was a Meek. She never flopped. I'm in good shape. I mean, in Paris, I'm always on my bike. Always complaining! Bu'! a vacation is a vacation You give your body a break If you return even more worn out, why bother going away? Fuck scuba-diving! [wanted to stay on my lounger with a glass of punch. - Come on! - I'm tired. - Don'! just sit there. - Enough... Stop it, my thighs hurt, Magali! And so we fought again. I want to call Karine. To tell her? Forget it, she'll be asleep. Estelle's death will be a shock. They didn't see each other much. All the same. They never liked each other. They're worids apart. One day, Estelle turned up at the office, demanding to see me, no regard for anyone... She told me she was in pain. She was aching all over, she said. I saw it was all a sham. Is my blood pressure 0k? I feel rough. Sure I'm 0K? Examine me. It aches here. When I breathe in, it really hurts. My breasts are sensitive, I feel oppressed. And my back too "when I walk. I can'! walk anywhere anymore. Want a closer look, Dr. Richard? If this is a joke, ifs not funny. Get dressed now or... or? I'll start yelling and cause a scandal. I'm serious. Why get angry? - Come on, we're friends. - Get out! I told her she was way off the mark and that her behavior was pathetic. For pitys sake! Come on. - Out! - Thank you, doctor. - I feel much better. - You're welcome. Mrs. Clément? Have a seat. - You told Simon? - No, but I told Karine. What did she say? Nothing at all. I can't have been the only one she tried it with. Probably not. Never "with you? No... Not once. I'll send them to your doctor. Nothing to tell me, Max? I'll send him the report. - How are my lungs? - Excellent. Get om. You're sure? Think Simon holds back? No regrets? - That's Simon's cell. - What do we do? Is there a name? - Pascaline. - What? Pascaline, my daughter? No, ifs Max. Thanks a lot. You want Simon or your dad? Pascaline, ifs Dad. I was calling a friend, but got the wrong number. Wrong number? Bu! you have Simon's. I can'! talk now, I'm revising. Shh... She hung up! Maybe she'd finished. She said she was calling someone else. I'm not stupid! - Possible. - She has his number! Why not? Ifs abnormal for my daughter to have Simon's number! Ifs not a secret number. Max, she's calling him at 1:40 am! Dani pretend not to understand. Look! 1:40! - I can see, no need to... - So? - So what? - I have to spell it out? Here, spell R out on this. That's not funny. Look, Pascaline. Ifs your father. Call me back quickly, please, it's extremely urgent. - She didn't pick up? - No, she didn't! - She just called. - She won'! talk to me. 'Cos she doesn't know what to say! This proves it. I'm flabbergasted! Simon with my daughter! - No way! - Maybe there's another explanation. - Such as? - I don'! know. Maybe she warned advice for a friend who wants to do hair or who needs training. This late? We know what Simon's like. Usually, who does she date? Normal guys of her own age. She was dating a fellow student. You actually met him? I saw him. Same age, serious, hard working, friendly.l liked him. Then she talked about him less and I found om it was over, too bad. When I asked about her new guy, she wouldn't tell me. I sensed right away he wasn't... - What? - Presentable. But being tolerant, I thought, “Let her see for herself.” Bu! (his! I don'! understand. Where did I go wrong as a father, if she's fallen for that old man! Do you have kids? No! So shut the hell up! That's a really dumb remark. I have photos of him feeding her. You've seen them? - Ifs 0k. - I need some of those pills! Dani you start too! Get a grip! Your daughter's 22. And Simon? How old is Simon? Worked om the difference? He could be her grandfather! Married too! Not anymore. I know her studies and the family aren't everything, I'm not stupid. A girl her age shouldn't go for some decrepit fake rocker! True. Tell me... - Did you know-v? - Are you crazy? - Look at me! - I'm looking. - Swear you didn't know-v. - How could I know-v? - He could've told you. - Me? Why not? On everything I hold dear, whatever that is, I swear I know nothing. I'm the last person Simon would tell. Think for a second. - 'Jkmat now? - I need to talk to him! - What about? - Simon, wake up! - He's totally out of it! - I'll make him come round! Answer me one question... What's going on with my daughter? I don'! understand. What's going on with Pascaline? He's in no state. Look, his eyes are gone. How long has it been going on with Pascaline? Pascaline... You heard that? Paul, you made him say it! Who are you calling? - Karine! - Why? Pascaline! Shut the hell up! Shut up! You heard that, right? Pervert! - He said nothing. - Pascaline... You heard this time? Clean out your ears! Shut the hell up! He's totally om of it! Pascaline! Shut up now! Shut up! She spends her whole life sleeping! She pisses me off! - Why call Karine? - To see if she knows about this! If she's asleep, she doesn't know. If we speak three times a day, ifs a record! Even then, it's uninteresting stuff! I said it was peaceful but ifs worse than that! We've flat-lined. Zero communication! Men and women communicate now? Arguing isn't communicating! - I even think maybe I bore her. - That's not possible. She should've married you. No way. Karine isn't my type! Pascaline! You wanted to call the cops? I agree now! We're not getting into hot water for this lunatic! - Call them! - Wail... What for? You've talked me round. Call them! Second thoughts? We can'! be so categorical. It's Simon after all. Are you winding me up?! Yes. - Shut up, you damn pervert! - Want me to see to him? Try to relax! - Want some herb tea? - Fuck herb tea! - What are you looking for? - The local police station's number... Hurry it up! I can'! find it! How come an obsessive-compulsive like you can'! find a notebook? Shh! Where the hell is it? Pressuring me won'! help. No, my socks... Pascaline... Bingo! I knew it was somewhere. - I haveAmbroggPs number too... - Screw that! Come on! - They work all night? - No idea. Put the speaker on. Police, can I help you? I can 'f hear you. Police, go ahead. “Ma? going on? Hell them everything now or tell them to come? Just report a crime! - I've never done this before. - Say ifs about a crime. A homicide. A woman has been strangled, the culprit's here. Give the address. - What address? - What? - Mine or Simon's? - Yours! He's here at your place! - The bodys at his place! - They already found it! 0k, I'll play it by ear. He'll ask questions and I'll improvise. He'll question me and I'll improvise. No need to get worked up. Police, can I help you? Go on! - Why don'! you do if? - Not me. It's your home, you make the call. You give your name, my name and the address. You're a doctor. A doctor has more weight. - You're a doctor too! - I only take photos now. You help people, you cure them... - He won't ask my job! - Say you're a doctor. - For God's sake! Which button? - Redial. Just improvise... Police! Good evening, sir. Say you're a doctor. Go ahead. - Say you're a doctor. - I'm a doctor... What? A woman has been... - He's staring at me. - Who? - Simon. He's staring at me. - He's in the bedroom! Stop wasting my time. Some jerks winding me up! I can'! do it... We don'! rat on him? I agree. Help me. Where's Pascaline? - Pain in the ass! - Pascaline... We spent the whole night in a state of shock. We continued to talk I! over, exchanging all kinds of opinions. Neither one wanted to admit defeat until the next morning. I! was non-amp. We didrfi sleep a wink. Don'! worry. I'm still at Max's. The game ran on and on. Everything3 0k. Well, 0k... Yes, everything's 0k. Right then... Shh... I don'! believe R. You need a degree to make coffee! Ifs simple, watch. Easy. Isn't Karine worried? She's still asleep! - When does she wake? - 9. I leave for work before she wakes. True, that is a lot. - Is she on anything? - I don'! think so. Does Magali sleep that much? Ifs been a while since When you see each other, mmat do you do? We fight. Thank you. I forget if I fought as much "with the others. I remember. Forgotten Chrisielle? Christelle. .. Hell every other week. Her three kids didn't want me around. Me or anyone. It was impossible. And that other one... Marianne. She was pretty special. A militant in a revolutionary party. Totally political and a bit... It was quaint and refreshing at first, then she began to bust my balls. Whenever we went out, I was on my guard as she could go off any minute. What about Lauréne? With her, no kids, no politics, no emotional blackmail... What is it you 'want me to say? I screwed it all up? Are you happy like this? No, I'm not happy. If I was, you'd know. I never really got over my divorce. Since then, I've spent my life being afraid. Afraid of mistakes, of commitment, of regrets... And now, today... I'm all alone. Coming home to empty rooms, calling pals to find someone to spend the evening with, eating om every night so as not to be alone here... I don'! have kids... but, God, I Wish I did. Anyhow... what can you do? Is there any coffee? Did you have a good night? A good night? What time is h? 20 minutes to 7. Shit, the sun's up. - My head... - You remember mmat happened, right? - Yes. - What you did? Don'! worry, I remember. - I can't believe... - What? I'll never see Estelle again. Talking to you last night, I "was getting used to it but now... I realize Ts more complicated. Your lawyer will plead a crime of passion. You loved her, you couldn't face her cheating on you. She was everything to you, etc. Lawyers love plucking heartstrings. Some take it up just for that. So, you thought it over? Yes, we thought it over. We completed our deliberations. We reached an agreement. - You're on your own. - I see. Mad at us? Now I'd like you to answer a question. Ifs a simple question. That'll be Karine. Ifs fine. Hold on, Who did you say you are? I'll put him on. The police... Max Andréani? Yes, speaking. You're not alone? I'm at home, at my place of residence... with a friend, Paul Richard, a doctor... ls a Simon Boubat there too? Yes, I'm "with Simon Boubat too. He's right here. I'll put him on. The police. Hello, Simon Boubat. How can I help you? Ifs about your wife. What's wrong? She had an accident? Not an accident. More like homicide. What? Homicide?! Against me? I'll expect you at 8:30 at police HQ, room 157, Officer Delpierre. I'll be there. Thank you. Estelle isn't dead! She's pressing charges against me for attempted murder. He says he'll come. We'll pm him in custody. The bastard. Thank you for helping, inspector. Sergeant. - Then again“. - Sergeant. Then again mmat? Ifs crazy. When I lefl her, she was... Unconscious! Passed out! You didn't squeeze long enough! Thanks a lot, Simon, for giving us a night like that! So everything isn't... You acted like a criminal and a coward! You strangled her, lefl her and ran! I'll head home and freshen up first. Take a toothbmsh and blankets. What do I tell Pascaline? What do I tell her? - Pascaline? - Yes, Pascaline, see who I mean? That pretty blond, 32 years younger than you! - Why Pascaline? - Why not? You're close, right? I need some air. This is huge. It'll be a shock for her. - How long has it lasted? - What? - I know-v! - What? I know! - You're crazy. - She called you and I answered! - What did she say? - She wouldn't speak to me! Hold on, you think Pascaline... Why did she call you? What are you two up to? See that? He's lost for words! She's pretty, young and naive. You're a smooth-talker, partial to fresh meat... - Of the three of us... - Bullshit! She doesn't call you at night to chat! - Max? - Explain. - You think the same? - Say something, then I'll think. Think what you want. You're not going anywhere! - Let go. - Answer me! Come on, shall I help? She's in love, you tried to reject her, but she wouldn't listen to you. Is (ha! it? You're irresistible! - Let go! - Stay om of this! Ok. I'm not sleeping with Pascaline. The idea is appalling. - So why does she call you? - Because she can talk to me! Like it or not, she confides in me! - She talks to her mother! - Her mother? She sleeps! She's in a coma! You know that! All her father cares about are her exam results. So when she needs to talk to someone she doesn't need to impress, she turns to me. - You? - Yes,me! Him! You! You find the words? I don'! find the words, Paul. I listen to her. I listen. And... does she call you a lot. Lately, yes. I shouldn't say this... She's 3 and half months pregnant. She loves the boy, he's her age and doesn't have a job. So mmat does she do? She needs advice. And maybe money. - I promised not to tell you. - What about me? Can'! I... What about me? This means I can't find the words? Tell Pascaline I'll be off the scene for a "while. I'm sorryl betrayed her trust and give her all my love. One last thing. She wants to quit medicine, but can'! tell you. Warn some coffee? No. No thanks. I remember Pascaline's16th birthday. It was the day she got her exam results. All A's. At just 1e. Yes, two years early. I was so proud! And she was so happy for me. Then she decided to do medicine like her dad. Dr. Pascaline Richard... It sounds good. No regrets. What do I do? No idea,I don'! have kids. I mean with Karine. Go home and wake your wife. It's high time you talked. Talk? For ages now, we've been living in a sort of silence. I envied you for that. People said Karine and Paul... How does it work? Fighting is no good, not fighting is no better... I'll be going. What are you doing today? Are you working? No, ifs Saturday. You're right. Usually, on Saturday, I do the week's shopping "with Karine. I'm scared. When were you last scared "with Karine? Ages ago... A message from Pascaline. "Dad, I need to talk to you. Come for lunch near the apartment. Your loving daughter." You see. Goodbye, Max. Goodbye, Paul. Hi, Magali, ifs me. Ifs early. You're probably still asleep. I haven'! slept a wink because... I'll explain. I wanted to tell you... Let's try living together again. Imean... under the same roof. We'll manage it this time. I think I can still' do d'. I've thought it over and... Magali? You were listening? I didn't sleep either. So you've thought it over'? Yes. I have something to tell you. What? I'm pregnant. Why didn't you tell me? Fantastic! Subtitles by Ian Burley, a.s.i.f.
