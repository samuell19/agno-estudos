Si, se?or Miguel, everybody knows se?or Miguel. That was his plane we saw back there. - What is he do? Is he working? - Work? Se?or Miguel?

Well, you know at the star club wouldn't give you the world. - I have no idea you're a fellow American? - You didn't, eh? Well a fellow American, I'd say, home, New York, close 5th Avenue, perfume Chanel... education Barnard, taste in book doubtful. And what the devil are you doing here? - Waiting. - For what? For friends. Oh, you were wrong about Barnard, it was Kansas College. Oh, from the corn country. - You mind if I sit down? - No please. Thank you, so much. - How you friend are going to get here? On a yacht I hope, I expected to find them here when I arrived. Fishing trip, eh? You know, they fish, I don't know much about it. - Yes, very interesting. - Well, what's about my taste in books? - What you think of that one? - I loved it. - Then, you see? - No, I don't see it? - I think he's a great writer. - Really? Oh, he didn't make it with that one, for once the critics were. And who care what the critics say, I like it. Attagirl, I like your spirit. As a matter of fact, I was reading a piece about it in the magazine Insight. It's a corny magazine, you shouldn't read it. - I think he's a romantic. - You do? Why? Oh, the things his done, world famous with his first book. Traveling all over the world, getting into war... hunting big game in Africa. Oh, I think it's wonderful. And then and then disappearing like that, when he had everything. Yes alright, he is romantic. How do you suppose a man as famous as that manages to disappear? - Maybe he's dead. - You don't think so. - Se?or Miguel, se?or Miguel? - Si? Excuse me, I have a message for Se?or Latimer. - Whom? - Se?or Latimer. It's about the boat. Pedro, he wants to know if you go fishing tomorrow? Yeah sure, come as same time. Have him bring some fresh bait, will you? Sure, gracias se?or. - What did he call you? - What's your name? I suppose it appeals to your sense of humor Mr. Latimer to like me make a fool of myself. No, come on, you knew who I was. How you like to go fishing in the morning? - No, now just a minute Mr. Latimer. - Just call me Mike. - And how about a real drink? - Look, look, I'm a, look... - Tequila, you'll like it. - No, thank you. You're the, you're... Come fishing in the morning, you'll like that too. Hey, hey... - Back it. - What? I think you hook. You got it. - A wonderful night. - Yeah, sure is. - You're happy living here, aren't you Mike? - Yeah, it's alright. - What's the bullet for? - That's got my name on it Katie. No, it's just sort of lucky, I'd tell you about it sometime. Mike, why did you give up writing? Say, you're a quizzy sort of girl, aren't you? - Am I? - Yeah. For the last week, what do I think? What do I eat? Do I sleep night? Where am I going and why? What do I know about you? You live in New York... you are on a vacation with a fishing party and you hate fishing, period. I'm sorry, it's just that I'm interested, that's all. That's sure so am I. But let's talk about you for a while. Katie, just answer one question, will you? - Alright. - You married? No Mike. Yeah, yes it is a pretty wonderful night up there. Sorry I don't understand you. - The telephone, New York. - New York? - New York please. - Yes, thank you. - Is really New York? - Hello, who's there? Hello? I am to speak with Katherine Connors. Henry McCartin, Insight magazine, who's this speaking? - This is Fernandez, the taxi driver. - Who? Un momentico, New York. - Hello? - Hello, this is Hank, is you Katie? - Yes Hank, this is Katie. - Did you find him? - Yes, I found him. - What? I said I found him, he's here. - What's that? - I said why didn't you call. I couldn't call you Hank, the line hadn't been working. Oh well, how things working out with Latimer? Alright I guess. Except that I haven't seen him for the last 3 days. He hasn't been out of his room. - I didn't get that. - I said why he hasn't him been out? I do not know why. But Hank, I've been thinking... I'm not sure I'm the right person to do the story Hank. I can't hear you hello Hank hello. Mike. - Go away Katie. - What's wrong with you? Nothing, nothing, that's all. Is this the way you work? Always, always worked this way. Should not try it Katie, when you've lost it, you've lost it. Lost what? - Let's keep it to me, understand? - No, I don't. When a guy like me can't write, they got to shoot him. Why I let this going on for 5 years, I'll never known. Mike, why? Why, why, why, why, why. You know why that last book of mine is no good Katie, eh? Because it's a phony, it's a fake. You want to know when I really began to write? When I, when I knew I could write? When I married Connie. With Connie, you knew the truth, you... you noted, you, you felt. Connie Connie... You noted a character Harrigan in my last book? I didn't like it. That's my fault, he a great guy, real name was Mallory. The three of us were in Africa, a safari beginning. Connie didn't seem to like him either, she'd seemed to wish leave her alone. I was so stupid. Couldn't understand, couldn't see what was happening. I thought I knew her better than any man knew any woman. And I can't see it. She tried to tell me out there in the... bush country, a 1000 miles of nowhere, she wanted to quit, to go home. I blew my cap. That's how stupid I was. The next night, I found them together. I'm so sorry but please don't tell me anymore. Yeah, I was sorry too, was so sorry I felt apart, I went a pieces. And I came home, alone... for the book Insight, I couldn't write, was finished. Where is she now Mike? I don't know, somewhere. Maybe in Africa where I left her. But wherever she is, she is with him. Mike, what make you tell me this? I didn't mean to Katie, I didn't mean to unloaded on you. But I haven't talk to a girl like you in a long time. I guess a guy gets kind of tired talking to myself. You're a good girl Katie, I trust you. You are a good girl. They got you working, eh? - Where you going? - Home. - It's pretty suddenly, isn't it? - Like you said to go back. Oh, what about your friends and the fishing party? I don't know what happened to them, I can't wait any longer, I just can't. - Yeah, I can see you're in quite a hurry. - I should leave a note for you. Thank you, how you going? I got a plane in Mexico City out to Acapulco. - I'm going there by car. - By car? But not in that old box of bolts outside, you know how far Acapulco is? How many times do you started for Acapulco? Seven times. Then how do you liked Acapulco? I don't know, I haven't been there. Well, what happened Fernandez, you better tell the lady. The road is very bad but I feel like I get there this time, maybe. - My friend, no Acapulco. - No Acapulco. - I got a plane, I'll fly you to Mexico City. - No Mike. - You'd never get a better offer. - Yeah but I can't let you do that. Yes, you can, I want you to let me do that, in fact you can't do anything else. - But... - Now relax, it's all settled. But first, we'll have a drink or my friends... will think you don't like them, right Fernandez? - Put the belt up. - I'm sitting on something. - I don't need this in Mexico City. - Hey, hey, not next to the compass Katie. Come back soon se?orita Katie, then we'll give you another good again. Oh, I don't think I'll return the favor. Se?or Miguel, se?or Miguel, tequila for the altitude. Oh, Fernandez, don't forget that wire to Mexico City for me, Ok? - I'll send it right away. - Good. - And don't overwork yourself. - Oh, no. - You still there? - Oh, just about. - Where are we? - Right on course, Mexico City stays ahead. - About that address? - You never write letters. No, I'm still good for a ten words telegram but I got to know where to send it. - Want a bouch? - No thanks. Thanks. Katie, got to get down now, make sure of your stuff, maybe a little rough. - Where are we? - Should be over Mexico City. - What was that? - Wasn't Mexico City. - What's wrong? - I don't know, maybe they move it. - You see anybody you know? - I don't see anything but jungle. What we do now? Turn back? - No, can't do. - Why not? - Gas. - Oh no. Now take it easy Katie, I can land this kite in a tornado path... that compass maybe off but the sun isn't. Somewhere ahead is the east coast. You keep your eyes open for a nice blue beach and we'll have a swim before breakfast. Mike, look. That's it, it's got to be. Mike Mike... He'll be alright, he'll came shortly. You better come along with me. - Katie. - Mike? Mike, you alright? Well, a little punchy, but Ok I guess, how about you? - I'm fine, this is Mr. Brown. - How do you do? Plane crash, when I look up and there he were. Thank you very much, we sure pick the right spot. Yes, you certainly did, the fact it's there's only jungle for miles around. Well, where exactly are we? - Oh, you don't know? - No, I... - Please, sit down, wont you? - Thank you. I, I though we were headed for the east coast. Yes, you were bearing in the right direction. You've certainly been extremely lucky, we are delighted to have you with us. - Brown is read all your books. - Yes, you'll find them all inside. - I noted about Africa myself. - Oh, you haunted there? In Kenya, I used to know the country very well. So that's it. I seem to feel we've met before, wasn't it Nairobi? - No. - No? Or it must've been England, I spent a lot of time there during the war. I don't think so. You might easily forgotten me, remember that I should never not forget meeting with you. - You understand that? - Not one word. It means food is up, I'm sure you both are ready for it. Oh yes, thank you very much, just give time to get my clothes on, will you? You go Miss Connors? - Sorry for waiting. - Oh, come and sit down Latimer. This is my colleague Dr. Van Anders, Michael Latimer. - How are you doctor? - How do you do? Oh, I guess I had you to thanks for patching me up, don't I? - No, not me Mr. Latimer. - Van Anders is specialist in archeology... not medicine, he's from Amsterdam university. Yeah, I was wondering what you were doing here in the middle of the jungle. You interested in archeology Latimer? No, I'm afraid not, ancient civilizations is a little out of my line. I'm still trying to figure out the one I'm living in. That's our interested in anything that didn't happen at least 1000 years ago. What do you look to dig up here Doc? Evidence of an very early civilization, pre Maya. Pre Maya? I didn't think there was any before the Maya, what do you found? You won't get anything out of Van. He won't talk until he's ready to publish his findings. As a matter of fact I made a very interesting find today. - Is it? - It belongs to your civilization not mine. Oh yes, it certainly does, it belongs to me. Yes, one of the servants picked it up, I'm interested. - Where's the rifle for it? - There's any. - Did you bring any fire arm? - Only a 45. Oh, why do you carry a rifle bullet if you haven't got a rifle? - Because it has his name on it, has it Mike? - That's right. A man of courage and intellect, and you believe in lucky charms? No, no, I don't go for all that talk about courage. All I have in head was a fixed idea it wasn't my time yet. - And why this lucky charm? - Because one day I lost the idea... - I got scared. - When was that? - D Day 1944. - Oh, you were a soldier. Correspondent... they dropped me in the Normandy with the air-bone troops 6 hours before the landings. I don't know what happened but... all of the sudden I thought that I was going to get it, so I panicked and I ran. I didn't know where I just want to find myself a hole in the ground. I did, only there was a German in it. He rifle was pointed right here, I even heard the bolt click... - What happened then? - Nothing. When the argument was over I had his rifle and that bullet was in it. He got the gun jammed but he was more scared than I was, I don't know. But I do know that bullet is got my name on it. - And I don't anybody else to have it. - You better give it back to him Van. - Oh, certainly. - Thank you Doctor, you're a life saver. - Watch dogs are here? - Yes, those are our dogs. - Sounds like quite a pack. - There only out at night. - I wouldn't be out there, sound savage. - They are. Why you keeping for? Well you see, our Indians here have the habit of disappearing... they come back 2, 3 weeks later, slow up our work. Now they go to their huts at night and remain there. Well... - that's, that's quite an idea. - That works. Van, you scared Miss Connors. Everything is perfectly alright. You don't have to worry about, just don't wander about side. That's Jan, Van assistant, he's a Dutchman too. Strong and silent type. Well, I could've sworn it was the place. - Couldn't have been here. - Yes it was, look. Here the marks where we skidded. I don't get it. - Hello. - Good morning. We've just found your bags in one of the Indian huts. I think you better check them over in case anything is missing. What I'm afraid is really missing is the plane. - The plane? - Yes. I'm told what was left up wouldn't fly but it certainly wouldn't walk either, you think? Of course not, you sure you look in the right place? Yes, I looked in the right place. Oh well, we will find it for you, these Indians can find anything, you know? Yes but you see, this isn't exactly funny. I kind of figure on patching up that plane to get out of here. We'll get you out of here alright, don't you worry about that. You took a pretty hard knock yesterday, you need a bit of a rest before you go. See, they'll be searching for us, no one knows where we are. Is there some way of sending a message? Sorry, I wish there were. Our only contact with the outside world is what we hear on the radio. What we going to do? Just make yourself at home and leave everything to us. By the way, you said you had a revolver? - Yes, I did. - Well, it's not here. I got to go and inspect those huts again. What you make of it? I'm not sure, there's a couple of strange men. I looked in the books this morning, you know what? - What? - It's not one single book on archeology. What is all about? I can I only remember where I met Mr. Brown maybe I could tell you. It's crazy but every time he opens his mouth... - Ah, it's ridiculous. - What? Nothing, nothing, with you help we can find out where we are. Are you sure you won't any of our little brainy Miss Connors? Oh no, no thank you. - What about you Latimer? - No, I still a bit, thanks. - Is it working? - In just a second. - We'll see what you can get you. - Can I help you find a book? You know I have one. I only read Nietzsche in translation, I see you read him in German, - Or is this your doctor? - It's a language of science. Every civilized European knows German. Well, that leave me out, what about you Brown? Van doesn't recognize the English as civilized Europeans. - You speak German? - No, I'm afraid not. Andes had been learn that Latimer took off from San Marcos and highly spirited. It is characteristic of the novelist colorful career that he should reappear... only to vanish again in even more dramatic circumstances. Search planes are becoming the wild the mountainous country... but at this late hour there's small hope that they will be found alive. - Little do they knew, - Know, you position is unique. Why? Tomorrow you picture will be in every newspaper, lively or dead. Not many of us can escape our past but you can, I envy you. What do you got to escape from? The girl who was lost with Michael Latimer has been identified as Katherine Connors... of the editorial staff of the wildly read magazine Insight. The magazine head editor Henry McCartin... said in New York tonight, that the last word he had with Miss Connors... was that she had discovered Latimer and hope to get the intimus personal facts... which cause the novelist to cut off his writing career at the peak of his fame. Miss Connors who join the magazine a year ago and attracted attention with her... frank and searching non set personality, profile of problematic personalities. You are quite a girl Katie. Mike, please try to understand me. I do. It seems, as the Americans said, she's been taking out Latimer for a ride. Mike, Mike you got to listen to me. Alright then, it's true I deceive you. It's true I was send down to find you. But even worse, it was my own idea. I happen to love your work and I wanted to know why you quit. Mike, a man of your talent have no right to quit. You can skip the literary criticism. - What else could I do? - Just being honest honey. And get my story? You would've kicked me from here to Halifax. You got your story. Yes, is terrific, you want to know something else, I'm not going to write it. - Of course not. - Mike, it's happens to be the truth. What do you know about truth? Or honesty, do it the hard way, without using your big brown eyes to get ahead. But don't give yourself too much credit, anyone of those poor eye masters... from your noisy little magazine might've done just as well, I was ready. You do this for money or you got a pearl to pray into people's lives. The new kind of journalism, let play peeping-tom. I salute you, you did a fine job, you go far. - What is it? - Mastins are listening to a noise. - Where's Jan? - Absent. - It's better we check on it. - Yeah. Stop, get in there. - You check on Latimer? - No. Well, he's asleep is better. Ah, what's all the commotion? The dogs must've stare a jungle car, thought you must be wondering what it's all about. Oh, it sounded so close. I thought they were after me. No, we've hate if that happened Latimer, it's alright, go back to sleep, good night. Good night. Put the book down, I have to talk to you. You can't speak polity why speak at all. I don't want to talk to you but I have to, I found out something last night. So did I. Now look old girl, we'll have to drop the personal feud till we get out of here. Since our most present problem will be how to get out. A mysterious is sound. I'm trying to tell you that theses men aren't Hollanders, they're Germans. Oh, how really? Mr. Brown a German? No, no, not him, the others. But he lied, he speaks German as well as they do. If suppose if I spoke French that will made me Mata Hari. Shut up and listen, I telling you the owners of this joint aren't lettings with us. Why don't you speak English Mr. Latimer, use to write it so well. Look, they got a secret workshop here. Tools, guns, airplane parts, even a vent propeller of my plane. And my automatic which the Indians are supposed to have grabbed. - Now, what is that head up to? - You tell me. I don't know yet but I do know that there lies plus they're being here in this forgotten ruins in the middle of nowhere plus the hounds of the Baskervilles. Heads up to a pretty weird set up we drop in to. - If you trying to frighten me, you succeed. - It's about time. Our only chance to get out of here is to work together, agreed? - Well? - I guess so. Ok, right now I want to take a walk, you come along to make look it casual. It wouldn't mind I'll be getting casual. - Where we going? - First thing to find the plane. Suppose you know we going in the wrong direction. Not to forget to find it, we work our way clear around. Probably stashed away, where it can't be seen by search parties, don't look back, idiot. - They're following us. - No? - Are you scared? - Well, not afraid. Then smile kid, smile. - There it is. - Katie. - It's not my plane. - What? What he going to do? He's taking our report card to teachery. What if the teacher hear it and he doesn't like it? I think I got it... It's crazy but it could be. - Here he comes. - Well, let him come. - Hold him here and keep him talking. - Do what? - Keep him talking. - How? You know how. - Where's Latimer? - Oh, he's getting me a drink. - Oh but we keep the drinks in here. - No, no, just, just a glass of water. - Oh, I see. - He'll be right back. Well, I understand you discovered our little secret. - I don't know, what secret? - Our airplane. Oh yes, why didn't you tell you have a plane? Yeah, that was stupid of me, I can see that now but... I really wanted to keep it a pleasant surprise for you. You tell us that we're completed cut off here. Oh yes but we are. Unfortunately we have engine trouble, we still working on it. Yes, we met your mechanic. Jan? Yes, an excellent pilot but I'm afraid he's not as bright as he might be. He seem to think that you and Latimer were about to take off. Oh, we thought we found our plane. Yes, of course, that's really why he won't leave it, it might disappear as yours did. I tell you, our Indians are strange people, they're very superstitious. I'd believe in a legend that one day their... Childs will be destroy by an evil bird from the sky, so that terrifies them. - What is it? - Doctor, don't, don't do that. Very interesting that story about the Indians. So that's what happened to my plane, eh? They thought it was a big bad bird. What did they do with it? Burned or buried? I really couldn't say that, it's the only explanation I can think of. Find a good story, you mind if I use it sometime? Certainly not, if you ever start writing again. Oh, don't you believe what Miss Connors is tell you, I'm writing again. Could be the best thing I've ever done. If I could finish it. I thought you were getting Miss Connors a glass of water? Yes, yes I was but I got the thinking of that story right out of my head, right out. Maybe you two could help work it out? I'm not interested in novel writing Latimer. Oh but you will in this. Especially you Brown, the principal character is an Englishman. Oh, really? I yet to find an American author who could handle an English character convincingly. But they all try. Well then, I may listen to this. Alright, Oh, let me see... Let's say, was born in 1908. Good stock, old and respected army family, his father perhaps a general. Education, traditional... say I'm not to good at this but let's say, Winchester and Cambridge University. - You doing very well. - Thank you. Brilliant boy, charming, handsome but... not too well like, perhaps he's, perhaps he's too ambitious. Yes, yes that's the problem of his character, ambition. Consequently, the army as a career is not for him, so what should he do? Diplomacy, that's he's fish, he had plenty of pool so he goes into the Foreign Office. Come the 1930, he's doing alright, remember the 1930 Mr Brown? Mass unemployment in England, corruption and rioting in France, civil war in Spain. A rat race, a world rotten with politics, he saw it all, And what he saw he despised. - Is this make sense to you so far Mr. Brown? - Lots of sense. - A fascinating character. - Oh yes, he is very smart. He sees where politics are heading. So, now what's happens? The British Embassy in Berlin. Let's say, 1937? No strikes, no unemployment, no rioting and the trains run on time. Order and authority, he likes it. Then something equally important, he falls in love. Very much in love. She is blonde, is beautiful, aristocratic. A true daughter of the master race. And then, Oh, I think I can do this part very well. Then the courtship. And what a courtship? Not just a boy and a girl getting together but a union of two states... England and Germany to run the world but... While boy and girl draw together, their two countries draw apart. Britannia yields Adolph on the church steps, that's very awkward, very awkward indeed. Now you got to remember three things about our hero. He's ambitious, he's madly in love and he's determined to be in the winning side. So, at this point he does something very reckless. He resigns from the British embassy publicly. How much much of this do we've to listen to? - Is that the end of your story Latimer? - Oh no, just bear with me for a minute. Suddenly our hero is a big man, he's a patriot... trying to keep Britain out war with the Reich. He marries the girl and when war does come, he stays in Berlin. And now the cards fall, just as he thought. Poland destroyed, France, Belgium, Holland, Norway, the apples are... falling, only one remains to be pick. England. His hour has struck. There must still be some sense in the British people, so he mad a direct appeal, how? By radio. He pleads, he warns, he threatens. Every nigh, his mellifluous voice is there. And step by step, he's become that lowest of all men. The traitor. The word traitor has no meaning Latimer, is only given to those who lose. Your General Washington was called traitor by the British but he won he's revere as a patriot. - Your might have saved England. - From victory? That's another word with no meaning. It's true Germany was crushed but what did England won? - The high commander... - Just a minute Van. We haven't heard the end of Latimer's story. - Or is that the end? - No. No, it got to be a last chapter but... It's not quite clear in my mind yet. - Your hero dies of course. - Oh no, he's a resourceful guy. When his dream world collapses, he gets out, save his skin. Ah, let's see, what about this... He ties up with 2 other guys who also have good reason to get out through Spain and Portugal... Wouldn't be too difficult, a very long walk Latimer. No, they grabbed a plane, one of them would be a pilot, Luftwaffe. - So they disappear. - And live happily ever after? What do you think? I think you've been very foolish telling us your story. No, I do not think so, it hasn't been published yet. I might not even write it, if I can make a deal. I can see if you have anything to offer. Oh but I do, there a wife in Germany. - Wouldn't be trade safe Miss Connors... - No. Quiet. Wouldn't you trade Miss Connors if I gave my word... to get the wife out and help you join her. - Mike, I'm not going to allow... - Shut up please.. But you see, my wife was killed in a bombing raid. They were British planes. You must forgive Van Anders, my wife happens to be his sister. Oh, I see. - Well, I guess that's that. - Yes. I don't see how we can let you leave now, do you? - You can't just keep us here forever. - No, we can't, can we? Fly her out, I'm sure she keeps her mouth shut. - You think we are idiots? - I'm telling you you can trust her. Are you sure? But it's very simple, if she breaks her word, she knows what will happen to me. - If you think I'll do what you say... - Please. - What do you say, is it a bargain? - No. It's very pathetic on you Latimer. We'll have to think further. Anyway, you still have to convince Miss Connors. For now you must stay indoors, both of you. So I really fixed it, didn't I? I should've keep my big mouth shut. - How do you know who he was? - For hearing when I see him. I knew that voice meant something to me, I heard it so many times during the war. I just can't think anymore, it's like a nightmare. What do we do now? The question is, what do they do now? Thing has to be done it should be done. And you were so sure that by now we've been forgotten. They recognized you, not me. You fool, didn't you see the look they gave you? You imagine he believe you're stuck out here just because I married your sister. - You didn't have to tell him that. - No but I did it. He's got quite a memory this Mr. Latimer, he'll get on you, just give him time. - You've lost as much time as it is. - What else had we lose? Our lives. You can't call this existence in this vacuum living, do you? I've got 10 years of this to think on John too, you know? Another 10 years ahead by the look of things. - I don't care how long it take. - Well, I do. 10 years in this blasted ruins with a handful of Indians... and the intellectual companionship of a professional soldier. It's a high price to pay for one's life, I'm not sure it worth it. Now listen to me Brown. I'm not throwing these years away, I've stocked out for one purpose only. One day I'm going home, back to Germany. - You got Germany to go back to. - Understand this... Nothing, no one is going to stand in my way out, I don't care what it is or who it is. Do I make myself quite clear? - Yes, I think I get your general meaning. - Good. I should be sorry though, I've enjoy having them around, it's been a pleasant change. - Now we better get Ir over with. - There's no need to panic. - If they manage to get away. - Where to? How? He won't leave the girl, how far can he get with her? I tell you, he'll give it a try. In that case, all we have to do is be prepared. - Who is it? - Be quiet. - Get up and get dress. - Why? - We're getting out of here. - Now? - Now or never. - Not me, I stay here, - Do as I tell you. - You don't think I'll go with you. You're wrong, I'm stuck with you. Now get dress and be quick. We'll never make it. If we don't, we've had it. Our only chance is to get to that plane. - But they won't kill us in cold blood. - They wouldn't, eh? You know who the good doctor is? Colonel Wilhelm Von Andereg. He wiped out a whole village, wiped out every men, women and child. He's at the top of the list, you think he stop at you? Wait, just give me a second. I got a gun stashed away and one bullet. - Ok? - No but I'm going. He's gone. We can't go back now, this way. He's gone. - So they couldn't get away? - They can't, I said that before. As long as he's alive we're in danger. Rather be on our choose than his. He doesn't know where he is. He's make the mistake taking the girl, that leave a trail a child could follow. - It must be noon. - Yeah. - We're leaving a trail a mile wide. - We're not going very fast. Here, eat this, will make you feel better. I hope you know where we going? Sun rises in the east, that where the coast is. Yeah but how far? - Find out when we get there. - I mean, how long... I'm sorry, on your feet. - Pigs? - Wild pigs, they can be mean. Stand still. They are going in the right direction. Hope their old tusker is as mean as it looks. Come on. Guess he was meaner than he looked, our luck is running good. - I got to rest a minute. - We can't. We got to keep going until dark, every minute counts, come on. We should've kept going and surprise them. More like that they surprise us, they hear us coming a mile off. We don't want to tangle with Latimer, would be getting him into our rifles sight. And we can't do that in the dark. I get some rest, you be likely to need it. - You sure you don't hear dogs? - No. - I think come an open fire is crazy. - We got to eat, how's the fish? Let's talk about, mean I enjoy it. - What's so funny? - I was just thinking. The boy is must've choke up with their brandy when they found out who you were. The one who real choke was you. I still think have and open fire is crazy. You've lot to learn about this stuff. Those guys feel pretty sure of themselves... they won't take a chance of falling into a trap. Hey, wait a minute. That's... That's a better idea. Listen, what do you think? No, take it easy, take it easy, it's alright. Come on, get up. Got to get moving. - What's that for? - That's for somebody in a hurry, I hope. Where we go from here? We'll get a foot bath, come on. - Don't drink. - You can't go... - Alright, you better rest a few minutes. - I'm alright, just damp, keep going. - Hey, get up. - Give me a minute. We haven't got a minute, come on. Let me go. - Katie. - Let me go. - Back in the swamp. - I'm alright. Katie. Katie. - Please, leave me here, leave me, go on. - Is that your great idea? - They're got of close. - Look. They're not far away, tracks are still wet, come on. Katie. Katie, Katie they just passed by us. - We were lucky. - Leave me, it's your only chance. That's right, keep on fighting me. I didn't want to fight with you Mike, I got you into this please leave me and go on. Now listen, whatever happens, happens to both of us. I want you to live. You think you can go on? - Alright, let's go. - But they're ahead of us. We're ahead of them, we're going back to the plane. And we going to get a good head start. - How you feel? - I'm alright. You doing fine, we're in the trail we came in. You only task now is to do is follow that trail we got here. Ready to go? Alright, let's get out of here. Katie, look, our military genius was so sure of himself his left that plane unguarded. If we could get there first, there's nothing to stop us. What we waiting for? - Mike... - Go to sleep Katie. Mike, I want to tell you something, just in case we don't make it. - We'll make it. - I mean just in case Mike. The trouble with you is you haven't learn the power of positive thinking. - I know but Mike... - Go to sleep Katie. Ok. Believe me so positive. Mike? - Was she very beautiful? - Who? - Your wife. - I don't know Katie, I forget. Katie. Katie, I'm sorry. - We never make it. - Got to make it, come on. Here, you take this and go on, go on, go on, go on. Mike. Mike. Your shoulder. Hold it. Watch out. - It's no way. - Latimer... Latimer, it's no use Latimer. You come to the end of you run. Now, open this door and come out. Now listen to me Latimer, there's no escape. But we're quite willing to let both of you go... if you give us your word you'll forget everything you've seen down here. - Are you listening Latimer? - I'm listening. Alright then, now open the door. - Are you there Latimer? - I'm here. Miss Connors? Miss Connors. She's disgusted we both of you Brown, she doesn't like boys that lose their tempers. You have to break the door John, we could get some in here. We lock the dogs up, but they won't come out. Alright, stay here. What's happening? Van went to get help. We haven't a chance, have we? It's our luck we're not Katie, I'm sorry. I don't care, I believe only belongs to happens to both of us. - You pick the wrong guy Katie. - No no... I picked the right guy... you know it and I know it. Latimer... Latimer, a bullet out here appear to has your name on it. Sure you spell it right? I hate to see the girl get hurt, she will you know when the door is broken down. Women and children first, that doesn't sound like you Brown. Now, this is important, I'm trying to give you a chance. In a few minutes Van will be back and this... door will be smashed in, he's quite mad, you know. You both be shot down where you stand, I won't be able to stop him. But suppose you Latimer, that you and I did a deal. I give you your life, you fly me to somewhere in South America. How about it? What about your buddy? What do we do about him? I have a rifle here, he won't do anything about it... but you better make up your mind quickly, he won't be away much longer. You know for a minute there you almost make sense Brown. But how can we trust a guy ready to shot out his friend? I'm telling you, it's your last chance. It's no deal. Alright, whatever happens now is on your own hands? We got to get him close to the door? How? I'll show you how, I'm getting out of here. Mike please you got to let me out of here, I can't take it any longer. Katie, stop it, don't be a fool, stay where you are. You got to take the deal with him Mike... Let me go, let me go, open the door... Let me go. Let me go, let me go, let me go Mike, let me go. Let me go, help me Mike, let me out. Katie.
