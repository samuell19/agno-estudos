I'll bring them right in. NANCY: Glad to be back? ARIELLE: Yes. NANCY: Me too. Ladies. Oh! You know what? Just leave everything here and bring the rest in, okay? -Thank you so much. -No problem. Laurie? We're back! Laurie? Laura? Laura? "Dear Nancy and Marty, "my mother isn't well and wants me to come West and stay with her. "Thanks for being so nice to me. "Please send me whatever you owe me to the below address. "My love to Arielle. Laurie." I just saw. -We'll work it out. -[SCOFFS] -[LAUGHS] Yeah. -You're welcome. [ALL SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] [TELEPHONE RINGING] -Hello? -Hi, Barbara, it's Nance. Oh, you're back! We thought you were getting home tonight. It's Nancy. Tell them to come over. Everyone is here. Thanks, Barbara, but we came home to a problem. Laurie has flown the coop. Oh, I think she was lonely, you know. There's nobody around here her age. No dates. Listen, I have to be in New York by tomorrow afternoon to show some of my designs. Is it all right if Arielle comes home with Mindy after nursery school? I should be back by late afternoon. I can come by and pick her up then. -Sure. -Thanks. Oh, any time. -Bye-bye. -Bye. -Marty and Nancy are back. -Oh, great! It's cold! [LAUGHS] -What's this? -That's me. This is stuff I shot in Florida. MARTY: Arielle, we have to go home tomorrow. How do you feel about that? I want to stay here. You want to stay with your Grandma and your Grandpa, right? Yeah. Wave to the camera. Hello, Daddy. I love you. -It's Elephant.-Elephant. MARTY: My girls. NANCY: Mmm-hmm. MARTY: Huh? We had a good time on this vacation, didn't we? ARIELLE: Yes. NANCY: What are you doing here? I'm just shooting myself in the mirror and... You. -Marty! -What? Oh, I should have never have given you that damn thing. -Are you kidding? -Am I asleep? Yeah. -[INAUDIBLE] -NANCY: What are you saying? My beautiful wife sleeping. -Look how gorgeous you are. -Oh, God. You should remain permanently pregnant. -Thanks a lot. -Hi, baby. [NANCY LAUGHS] Suddenly I got nervous about which designs to show them. Mmm-hmm. -Sorry I woke you. -No. [SIGHS] What do think? Sweetie, you know I like everything you do. That's no help. You like this one? Or this one? God, suddenly they all look terrible to me. I know. You just couldn't stop everything and burn your brushes. It's a shame. All right, look. You have to visualize this design all over a blouse. It's going to be too busy, too fussy. -You don't like it. -I'm visualizing. -All over a blouse, right? -Yeah. It's beautiful. Really. -Hi, Mommy. -Hi, honey. -Hey, a family conference. -Come here. [GRUNTS] What's that? That's a design for material for a blouse. -You like it? -Yes. See? Thank you, both. I'll give each of you a piece of the profits. Come on. Let's go to bed, okay? [SIGHS] Come on, sweetie. Mommy, I want a drink of water. Mmm! [CHUCKLES] Come on. Miss Sherman, I'll be going to New York today, so Arielle has to go home with Mindy after school. -Okay, Mrs. Klein. -Thanks. -Bye. -Bye, Mommy. Bye, Arielle! [THUNDER RUMBLING] -NANCY: Hello? -Hi. Listen, I am sorry to interrupt, but I'm telling you, it has turned into a nasty day out here on the island. Really? Well, nothing is happening here. Yeah, well, it is ugly here. Well, thank you. Um, I'll be... I'll be through soon. -Is it going well? -Yes, it is. I'll tell you about it later. I'm at the carpet company. I have just one more client. I should be home by 6:00. Oh, I'll be home long before that. I'll bring the caviar. Great. Thanks for calling. And I'll be careful. Okay. Thank you. Bye. I have to go. Nance? Honey? Nance? Arri? [ANSWERING MACHINE REWINDING] [BEEPS] Hi, Nancy, it's Gene. Barbara told me you were in the city today but I wanted to get my bid in for tennis tomorrow morning. Give me a ring, okay? [LINE DISCONNECTS] [BEEPS] WOMAN: This is Carpenter Memorial Hospital. Nancy Klein has been in a serious car accident. Please come to the Emergency Room at the hospital. And please drive carefully. [LINE DISCONNECTS] [BEEPS] [TELEPHONE RINGING] -Hello? -Barbara? Marty. Nancy has been in a car accident. We're in the hospital. Carpenter Memorial. -Oh, Marty. -Yeah. Her car, you know, skidded right into the other lane. And I haven't seen her or the doctor yet. All I know is that it's a head injury. Uh, don't tell Arielle. Arielle's fine. She's stayed over with Mindy enough not to think anything is wrong. Thanks. Is Stan there? He's on his way. MAN: [ON TV] Oh, so that's what... [TELEPHONE RINGING] [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Hello? -Fred, this is Marty. -Marty! Hi, um, Fred. Uh, Nancy is in the hospital. She's been in a car accident. Anne. Nancy's in the hospital. -What? -Marty, what happened? NURSE: [OVER PA] The Resident Latoya, please call the operator. The Resident Latoya, please call the operator. Stan, you shouldn't have come out on a night like this. Oh, come on. Have you seen her yet? Have they told you anything? It's the head. Well, that could be anything. A concussion. -Arielle is sound asleep. -Thanks. Mr. Klein? My name is Sears. I'm Head of the Department of Neurosurgery. Oh, this is Stan Rice, my good friend, Dr. Stan Rice. A pleasure. Would you please come with me, Mr. Klein? Please have a seat. Your wife has been in a very serious car accident. The car that hit her drove the post on the passenger side all the way over across the car and impacted the right side of her head, twisting the head on the neck. There are other parts of the head that can take a severe blow and sustain relatively little damage, but the brain stem at the base of the brain, all the nerves come together and go down the spinal column. It controls all the vital functions, consciousness, respiration, heartbeat. She's in a deep coma. That is, she is unresponsive in every way. Is she going to live? The next few days will tell us that. What's the... Well, first, we're gonna do everything to keep her alive. Frankly, we know so little about the brain, she might suddenly wake up, she might just as suddenly die. If she does wake up, we're just waiting and watching. There's no operation, there's no treatment. She's going to have to do it all by herself. [EXHALES DEEPLY] -You know that she's pregnant? -Yes. But for now, we're going to treat Nancy as the primary patient who is incidentally pregnant. We're going to concentrate on keeping Nancy alive. [KNOCKING] I think you can see your wife now before they take her to Intensive Care. ARNIE: Hi, Marty. Thanks for coming, Arnie. Your sister is really... I did call your Mom and Dad. Yeah, I'm meeting their plane tomorrow. Good. -I didn't call Janet. -I called her. Uh... She'll come with us tomorrow. [SIGHS] Thanks. Thanks, Vivian. Do you want to come? When she sends me an invitation. [CHUCKLES] Okay. Um... I'm going to go and see her now. Stan can tell you everything. Okay? [EXHALES] Okay. They adore her. Everybody loves Nancy. [MACHINE BEEPING] [SOFTLY] Nance? Do you want to spend the night? No, I think I want to get home. I'll get you some sleeping pills. Oh, Marty. Thanks so much for taking care of Arielle. She's asleep. You can stay here. I seem to want to go home. I think that Arielle should probably stay here. I can put her on the school bus in the morning with Mindy. That would be great. I called my mom. She's coming from Brooklyn tomorrow. -Hi, Daddy. -Hi. Hi, sweetie pie. Where's Mommy? Mommy was in a car accident. Another car hit her car and she is in the hospital. And she's asleep. Is the baby asleep too? Yeah. [TELEPHONE RINGING] -Hello? -FRAN: Marty. Oh, hi, Mom. I'm so sorry I didn't call you back. Stan came and then the doctor. Tell me. It's not good, Mom. Is she going to live? They have no idea. Oh, my God. Do you want me to come out tonight? Oh, no. The morning is fine. Besides, Arielle is with Barbara. But you're all alone out there. -I'm fine, Mom. -Well, I won't sleep. If you want to talk to someone, I'm here. Thanks. I'll see you tomorrow, okay? -Yeah. -Bye. [MACHINE BEEPING] NURSE: That's a respirator. She's not breathing on her own? At the moment, she needs some help breathing. And this is a pressure monitor cap, in case the pressure in her head increases. And that's a heart rate monitor. When we have time, we massage her hands for circulation, also to keep them from stiffening. Stiffening? Yes, there is a tendency to contract. -It's warm. -Oh, yes. [INAUDIBLE] There's no change. Hi. -Hi, Janet. -Hi, Marty. Okay, now listen. She has a lot of tubes. [SOBBING] Nancy? [FRED WEEPING] [SOBBING] It's Momma. Don't worry, Dad. She's gonna be okay. Oh, Marty! No. No, no, no. Sit please. -Tomorrow night. -Okay. Before she comes home, how much does Arielle know? She knows that her Mommy was in an accident, and she's in the hospital, and that she's asleep. And what should we say to her if she starts asking questions? Fred, I should think that we should... Never mind. We should all agree. How do you explain coma to her? I never knew anyone in a coma. I never knew anyone who knew anyone in a coma. Does Arielle know that Nancy's pregnant? Yes. Oh... I tell you, this is grotesque. Fred, please. To me, it's grotesque. Nancy lying there like that, carrying a child. I know nothing about medicine but... But I tell you, my mind tells me that she needs all the strength that she can pull together. One day at a time. For now. For... For... For Arielle, for all of us. We don't even know what our roles are yet. At least, I don't. And they will develop. And none of us must get sick. [DOOR OPENS] [DOOR CLOSES] We're back and sleepy. That's something I can do something about. That I can take care of. Look who's here. -[GRUNTS] -Here, sweetie-pie. Sweetie pie! -Look who's here. Huh? -Look. Look. Look. Look who's here. Grandma Anne! [LAUGHS] Oh, my girl. Look who's behind you. -Elephant! -Yes, she's smart. -Elephant. -[ARIELLE LAUGHING] Here's some pictures she drew for her mom. [SINGING IN FRENCH] -How are you, Ari? -Arielle. Oh, I'm sorry. Last month it was Ari. [LAUGHS] Just before she gets all wired up, let's go to sleep, okay, sweetie? Come here, baby. These pictures you drew for Mommy are gorgeous. -All right, say good night to everybody. -Good night. -Good night, angel. -Good night, Arielle. I'll see you tomorrow. Okay, I will. You know everybody is willing to help you with whatever. I know that. You are the greatest. Good night, everybody. Good night, everybody. ARIELLE: Good night, Elephant. ANNE: Don't let the bed bugs bite! MARTY: We won't. [DOOR CLOSES] [INHALES DEEPLY] I wonder where they found this bed. -She likes it. -She doesn't sleep in it. Maybe we ought to send for some more clothes. Wait. We'll need the car. Wait. What does that mean? "Wait." So many things to think about I can't think about anything. Maybe if I just think about how to get the car up here... Will she live? If she lives, maybe... Think about now. Don't think about a year from now. How much can Marty take? Shh! [ARIELLE CRYING] It's okay, sweetie pie. [PEOPLE SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] Patient has been unresponsive to verbal or physical commands. That's since 12 days. Though at 48 hours, husband thinks she may have squeezed his hand appropriately. Noxious response evoked more briskly from right than from left. [ALL MURMURING] [SIGHS] I'm afraid I'll have to agree with the original prognosis of Dr. Sears. It's poor for recovery of an independent state, probably not better than 5%. But I wouldn't be able to make a more accurate prediction of permanent disability until about three months. What about her pregnancy? Oh, I don't think the pregnancy can endanger her. In fact, she might make an ideal incubator. [BLOWS WHISTLE] Well, the prognosis is guarded, but I would say there is potential for reasonably good functional recovery at present. I would say about 35% to 50% chance of recovery. That's good news. What about the pregnancy? Doctor, I don't know but I think it's wrong her struggling there. She needs every ounce... It might be in her best interest to terminate the pregnancy. Now I would note that the quality of the infant, if brought to delivery, is in question. Thank you. Thank you. First, Mr. Klein, I want you to know how sympathetic we all are to your situation. It is cruel. It seems there's nobody in this hospital who doesn't feel somehow involved. At Dr. Kay's request, I have gathered all the records and reports here, and I have also asked a High Risk Team to go over the situation and give an opinion. Well, Marty, the fetus is making good integral growth. That's just in the point of view of size. It's still too early in the pregnancy to perform other tests, which would determine anything more about the quality that Dr. Syrmopoulous refers to. The general opinion here is that this pregnancy presents no immediate emergency. But Dr. Syrmopoulous said it might be in her interest to terminate the pregnancy. He did? I did not see a note of that, unless I missed it. His handwriting is almost as bad as mine. Well, he said it to me and to Nancy's parents. He said "might be." He didn't go any further. Oh, well, he might have been thinking down the line. But as I said, here, the view is that the pregnancy presents no immediate emergency. If you thought that there was an immediate emergency at this point... If a physician feels a mother's life is at immediate risk, he or she may perform a termination of the pregnancy right then and there without any by-your-leave. If there's not an emergency, but it's thought to be in her best interest for a better chance of eventual recovery, to awaken sooner from the coma. Then you would have to go to court, be appointed her legal guardian and get legal authorization. Legally, a woman pregnant less than 24 weeks can request a termination for any reason. But Mrs. Klein can't make that request. Does she lose her Constitutional rights by being in a coma? I can't answer that. As Nancy's obstetrician, I told Mr. Klein that I'd go along with whatever he decides, which doesn't do him much good because I don't do second trimester abortions and I doubt if my testimony would carry much weight in court. Do you do second trimester? Yes, up until the 18th week. Is there any danger? There's a danger in any surgical procedure. But it seems to me that the further we go into the second trimester, the greater the danger. Mr. Klein, I can understand your frustration. Wanting to do something for your wife when there seems to be nothing to do but wait. Your idea is to wait for an emergency and then hope you can do something about it? Well, more than hope. We have a very experienced staff. Experienced in pregnancy in a comatose woman? No, I doubt if many doctors are. I'm very grateful for the care that Nancy has received, but it seems to me, and it has never been said that no one here holds out much hope for Nancy's recovery. I want you to know that I'm going to do everything in my power to give Nancy a chance. I want everyone to know that. My concern is for my wife and for the child we already have. I want Nancy to recover to become the mother of our child again. I understand. I was with Nancy when she gave birth to our daughter, [VOICE BREAKING] and I look at her now with those tubes going in, and those tubes coming out, and I can't see that she can survive delivering a child. I went to three of my classmates from law school who now do litigation and they all said they'd like to take the case because it's going to be a landmark one, but they all said no. One and all said that in effect, by the time you are through, it will cost you around $40,000 and without impressive medical testimony, you'll lose. And in this county you'll probably lose anyway. I don't understand that. You probably never noticed, but this is a Right to Life county. The District Attorney is vocally anti-abortion and many of the judges are too. I would be petitioning for her constitutional rights. It's a federal law. What does it matter what county I live in? Federal laws administered by local D.A.'s, and local judges with local attitudes. What can I tell you? Down in Florida, we have friends who have a daughter. She's a doctor, OGBYN. OB/GYN. O-B, O-G, I don't know. She's a doctor, right? A woman's doctor. She said she gave an abortion to the same woman four times. Four times, and no questions asked. She told her she was stupid but she didn't have to go to court. Nancy's your wife, she's our daughter, you've signed for everything they've given her so far. So, who else should be the guardian, huh? Who else? This is to save her life. [MIMICKING NEIGHING] [ARIELLE LAUGHING] -Daddy? -Yeah? I can't remember Mommy's voice. Oh. Okay. [MIMICS NANCY] Arielle! Hurry up! The school bus is here. -What are you up to? -No. Arielle, it's time for bed. -What are you doing? -[LAUGHS] No. NANCY: Hi, we're not at home just now, but if you leave a message at the sound of the beep, we'll get back to you. ARIELLE: Wait for the beep. [BOTH LAUGHING] [BEEPS] Daddy, I want to see Mommy. We'll work on it. Not right away, but we'll work it out. Promise? I promise. Fran's gone home to Brooklyn for a few days. [CHUCKLES] I think she's really glad to get away. I think Fred and Anne would love to get away for a bit but they just don't know how to say to say it. If I say it, then they'll think that I don't want them here. [BEEPING ACCELERATES] -June? -Yes? June, did you hear that? Yes, that happened several times when I massaged her. Go and tell the doctor. I already did. They don't think it's significant. I never heard it before. I'm sorry, Marty, it's very common. Nancy, it's Marty. Nancy, I'm here. You did it once, you can do it again. Come on. Nancy. [SOFTLY] Nancy. [ANSWERING MACHINE BEEPS] RUTH: Hi, Nancy and Marty, it's Ruth and Steven. We haven't heard from you in so long, we thought we'd get in touch. Uh, Steve's at the hospital waiting to deliver twins. All of my patients are quiet. Hope you're both well, give us a call. Thanks. Bye. [BEEPS] [TELEPHONE RINGING] -Hello? -Ruth? It's Marty. Oh, that was quick action. -Have I called too late? -Oh, no. Steven is still at the hospital, but I got lucky. I got home by 8:00. So how are both of you? You're not gonna believe this. Two weeks ago, Nancy is coming back from New York, she was in a car accident. She's in the hospital now, she's in a coma. I think I should get her an abortion done. The hospital says... Marty... Marty, maybe I can help. Well, there's no question. The pregnancy must be terminated. But, R.J., don't you want to examine her first? What's to examine? She's in a traumatic coma. She's pregnant. According to Marty, everyone at Nancy's hospital disagrees with you. I know them out there. None better. It's not always a question of medical training but of personal prejudice. And the prejudice of the Administration and the Board of Trustees, and, and, and... Well... Perhaps I shouldn't say "prejudice," but the bent. What do you think our chances are of getting the Bio-Ethics Committee to let us bring her here? What exactly is a Bio-Ethics Committee? It's a committee made up of doctors, lawyers, ministers, civic leaders, nurses, etc. They meet to discuss the ethics of this or that situation, and then advise the hospital administration. And they decide whether or not the hospital will take Nancy? They advise. It's an unusual situation, Marty. Keep your fingers crossed. Yeah, I've got them crossed already. I mean... We're taking Arielle to see Nancy this afternoon. -She's finally asked. -Good. I'm glad to hear it. I'm scared, I have no idea how she's gonna react. Okay, now, you know that Mommy can't talk to you? Yes. -You know that she's asleep? -Yes. -Is this Arielle? -Yes. This is one of Mommy's nurses. She takes very good care of Mommy. You are a beautiful little girl. -Thank you. -You're welcome. See you later. Hi, Mommy. Can I kiss Mommy? Absolutely. We just won't wake her, okay? I'll draw Mommy a picture. -Great idea. -Oh, sure, honey. That's why we brought your crayons and your picture book. Here you go. Oh! Pick out your favorite color. Show Mommy what you made her. [GASPS] Oh, isn't that beautiful. [WHISPERS] Show Mommy. Now do you want to stay or do you want to come with me to the Y and we'll go swimming together? -Stay. -Okay. MARTY: Then comes the M. [ANNE CHUCKLES] Oh, that's nice. R.J.: Most of the things I do I'm not sure about. I don't know with this interruption of pregnancy if she's going to live or die, whether she's gonna remain a vegetable or recover. I do know that she has a better chance of survival if she is not pregnant. Instinctively and emotionally, I'm very much in favor of our doing this, but there is a question of the notoriety. Why notoriety? Well, a nurse on Mrs. Klein's floor sees she is being moved. Where to? What for? Words get around a hospital fast. You might be picketed. People chaining themselves to your doors. WOMAN: But they must perform abortions here every day. Yes, but if we move her here, she becomes a celebrated case. A chance for extremists to go to town. But still, if it's the right thing to do... [ALL SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] It seems to me this is not a medical matter at all, for all R.J.'s eloquence. The woman has a constitutional right to terminate the pregnancy for any reason, prior to 24 weeks. Isn't that right? But she's not in a position to exercise that right. I don't think her hospital is out of line to require her to get a court order. Oh, Marty. -Hi. -Hi. -Did Ruth reach you? -No. -They turned us down. -Damn. She couldn't tell me very much. It was all confidential. But maybe you can find out more. Marty, back before Ruth and all this business up there, I was in touch with someone. Uh... [STAMMERS] Have you ever heard of Rita Thompson? No. Well, she's very well known. [STAMMERS] When Fred and I were living up here, she was in the papers all the time. She's a very well known pro-choice person. You know, really active in all the women's movements. Well, I'm really surprised that you haven't heard of her. She's here now. Because she's in her second trimester, it's 15 weeks, I believe? Oh, yeah, but... About it. Well, we can't do anything in my clinic. But if you would give me a letter saying that you've come to me for help, I think I can find another way. Uh... A back door. What back door? Oh, well, I'd have to find one, but I think I could. Also, I'd like to mention your wife's situation at a rally I'm attending in Washington, to mark the 15th anniversary of Roe vs. Wade. This is an unusual case, but it dramatizes the situation of women's rights. I don't want Nancy spread all over the newspapers. With due respect, I don't want Nancy to be used for somebody else's agenda. Well, I could mention the case without using her name. I don't want to go through a back door. Sounds like a back alley. Nancy doesn't have to go through a back door. I am not suggesting anything illegal. We could go to another county, another state. I don't know. But I do know that if you go to court, you'll lose. So I've been told. If you lose, you'll not only lose, you'll do serious damage to the cause of women's rights. Any crack they can find in the law... What about the notoriety? You'll get plenty of notoriety if you go to court. Oh, and there's no notoriety if we go through your back door? [SIGHS] If you go to court, it will cost you a fortune, and we'll all lose. If they can stop a woman in a case like this, the Right-to-Lifers will be out in full force. You've got no medical testimony. Nobody from this hospital is going to... I'm sorry. I really appreciate your concern. The answer is no. ANNE: Oh. [SIGHS] I... Marty. Marty, Marty. What are we going to do if we lose in court? Nancy will be marked, no other hospital will take her. How can Thompson help us then? Anne, I'm sorry. How do we know who this back door doctor might be? How are we going to check on him? Anne, this is a family matter. I don't want Nancy to become some rallying cry. Marty, I'm her mother. She's my wife. I'm sorry. Thanks a lot. Oh, no. I did it for myself, I assure you. Now it's very nice of you to come all the way up here to thank me, and it's very nice to meet you, but I did it for myself. I'm sorry it didn't work out. May I ask what you plan to do next? I'm going for the court order. I don't think I have any other choice. Maybe you'd give me another chance? Maybe I could do a better job this time. Do my homework. I know I'm right, but courts are always impressed with references to case histories, if there are any. Ruth tells me that lawyers have been approached and they're wanting a great deal of money. I think I might be able to persuade an old comrade-in-arms of mine to take it on as I will take it on. For our own satisfaction. He and I have done each other a lot of favors over the years. His name is Herb Weisfeld. And if we win, I will get you the only doctor I would allow to do a second trimester termination. He will cost you money. [CHURCH BELLS TOLLING] CLERK: Petition of Martin Klein to become guardian of Nancy Klein. As I've noted, it's a matter of some urgency. We'd appreciate an early hearing. Of course, Mr. Weisfeld. The judge will want to talk to the District Attorney, the Attorney General, to show cause. I see you want to kill the child. Anne, you think that's enough coffee? Yeah. We can always make more. All right. -So much for privacy. -What? Oh! Oh, my God. "Dear Nancy, when your life comes into focus again, "and it will, "you will know how blessed you are with the love of Martin. "The beauty of your love has been shared by strangers like myself, "and has restored my faith." We'll keep that one. Ooh! We're into money. [CHUCKLES] "Dear Martin, you're having a rough time. "Have a drink on me. A good one." Look at that. They sent us a $5 bill. [PEOPLE SHOUTING] OFFICER: All right. Stay back. Stay back. Stay back. Stay back. Coming through. Come on, get back. Get back. All right, come one. Let's go. Get back. Don't stop. OFFICER: Keep moving. Keep moving. Keep moving. It goes without saying that this courtroom is open to the public, but there are certain rules that have to be followed. Basically they are ones of courtesy and respect. This is a court of law. It is not a forum for improper demonstrations or expressions of one's views. Let us all keep in mind that this is a very emotional and traumatic matter for the petitioner and the parents of Nancy Klein. At 16 weeks, the fetus is not viable. Viability of a fetus is, of course, determined by its ability to live outside the mother. Courts have ruled that a non-viable fetus is not a person and has no rights as a person. Now were Nancy Klein well and should have wanted to terminate the pregnancy, for whatever reason, it would have been a private matter between her and her physician, and no way, in no way, would the state have been involved. What we're asking for is for Martin Klein to stand in his wife's shoes to exercise her constitutional right, and give consent for the termination of this pregnancy to save her life. We have two new applications. The first is the petition of Charles Davis. Is Mr. Davis present? Joan Garner, 642 Sloan Street, New York, New York. Ms. Garner. Your Honor, this is a petition to declare Mrs. Klein incompetent and to declare Charles Davis her guardian. -Is she kidding? -[WHISPERS] GARNER: It is our opinion that a stranger might be the most appropriate person to be guardian, more so than the next of kin who might have conflict of interest. We'll hear the full argument later at a more appropriate time. Are there any other applications? Alan Stevenson, I represent Thomas Miller. Mr. Miller is petitioning to be named guardian of the fetus. [ALL MURMURING] We feel there is only one question before the court and that is the best interest of the patient or as we would argue, the patients. Plural. This is... Is this... This is a joke. Your Honor, the District Attorney waives an opening statement. As does the Assistant Attorney General. At this point, I'm going to call a 10 minute recess. I don't understand. How can they just come in there and petition... Take it easy. They can. They can petition to be the guardian of my wife, our child? They have the right. When someone becomes incompetent, the person can go to court and petition to be appointed his guardian, to take care of his affairs. Wouldn't that be a friend? Do you know these people? I don't know these people. Who are these people? They're the big guns in the local Right-To-Life movement. They could just delay us, couldn't they? Hold us up? Yes. How long do we have? Eight weeks? Until we won't be allowed to do anything even if we win? That's right. It's up to the judge whether or not she allows them standing in the case. [SIGHS] The number one cause of maternal mortality in the United States is pulmonary embolism, blood clot in the lung. What augments clot formation in this woman? She's not walking. She's lying in bed. She's turned from side to side by nurses. Her hands and feet are in splints. There's absolutely no motion. And blood clot is only one possible complication. Dr. Cannon, you said at the outset there is very little literature on trauma and the vegetative state in pregnancy. Last week I made a thorough study of the literature in the American experience. There were just two cases on record of women in coma coming to term giving birth. In both cases, they got live babies. In both cases, the mamas died. Now there's a notation by one of the neurologists which states, "I cannot tell how much function she will recover." Well, of course, he can't. Nor can medical science, nor can I. But what I'd like to do is to remove any possible stress from Nancy's body so she has the best possible chance of recovery. This is for life, not for abortion. This is pro-life of this patient. Your letter filed with Mr. Klein's petition in which you gave reasons why the pregnancy should be terminated was dated October 13th. Had you personally examined Mrs. Klein at that time? No. When did you examine her? October 16th. So when you had formed your opinion, you had not yet yourself examined her. -Is that correct? -That is correct. Now, Doctor, will you tell the court what techniques you would counsel for the abortion at this 16th week, second trimester, stage of the pregnancy? Dilation and evacuation, preceded the night before by the use of laminaria to soften the cervix. What does this procedure involve? The insertion of the laminaria the night before will cause dilation of the cervix. Can you clarify that? Laminaria are sterile pieces of sea weed-like sticks. The moisture in the cervix makes them expand causing dilation. How would the fetus be removed? Manually. Are there any risks to a woman in Mrs. Klein's condition? There are risks, but in my opinion, there is less of a risk than in continuing this pregnancy. [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] -That's good. -Yeah. -Good afternoon. -ANNE: Hi, there. This is the telephone number of the physician I recommended. He's waiting for you to call. Don't I need to know his name? No, just give your name and ask for the doctor. Isn't this premature? I won't be able to be here tomorrow. Oh. Thank you very much. You were very impressive today. Whatever happens, you were right. This pregnancy should be terminated. Thanks. Thank you. ANNE: So, what did he... What did he say? Now you stated to Mr. Klein's attorney that in your opinion a pregnancy could be difficult for Mrs. Klein's health if complications develop. Yes. Can you predict with any certainty that these complications will develop? No. Mrs. Zusselman, your daughter and son-in-law were very happy about the pregnancy. -Correct? -Yes. Did you ever discuss with any of the medical personnel at the hospital whether or not they could guarantee a perfect child? No. You never asked for a 100% guarantee of a perfect baby? No. I believe that we are finished for today. We will recess until 9:30 tomorrow morning, at which time we will hear the District Attorney's witnesses and we will again take up the petitions of Mr. Davis to be guardian of Mrs. Klein and Mr. Miller to be guardian of the fetus. [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] You know, I'm only doing this for your own good. Thank you. ANNE: Oh, look at grandpa! FRAN: Oh, Grandpa Fred is king, he's king. Oh, Your Majesty, [LAUGHS] Oh, I get another bow? Oh, thank you. I'm late. You're the prince! You're the prince! -I had to be with Herb. -FRED: You're the prince. FRAN: Oh, Your Majesty. I'm the prince. Thank you, sweetie. You know what? I'll be right back. Okay? Thanks. FRED: Well, we made all the channels. Someone called Tracy Jordan wants you to appear on a TV panel show on abortion. -Yeah. -She left her number. London called. BBC wants an interview. That one. Read that one. Faith healer from Malaysia. Says he would gladly come to see Nancy if you would send him the $2,000 air fare. MARTY: You would hate it. Every inch of your body described, analyzed in detail. Every tube going into you, and coming out. They want to get all the vivid details to the judge so that she can visualize exactly what's involved. Nancy, do you know that I'm with you? Nance? May I proceed with my witness, Your Honor? JUDGE: You may. Dr. Casey, what is your profession? I'm a physician and surgeon with a specialty in obstetrics and gynecology. Based upon your examination of Mrs. Klein, Doctor, what is your opinion as to the effects of this pregnancy upon the health of Mrs. Klein? The pregnancy at this point in time has no negative effects on the patient's health. What, if any dangers or risks are involved in this method of abortion? Danger of heavy bleeding. Danger of leaving part of the fetus inside. The procedure involves essentially breaking up the fetus. [GROANS] HERB: Dr. Dalton, I want to read you a statement made by Dr. R.J. Cannon, Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Scribner College of Medicine. "I believe with a degree of medical certainty "that Mrs. Klein's pregnancy presents "a serious threat to her life "and that a pregnancy interruption is indicated at this time." Now, do you agree or disagree with that statement? I disagree. HERB: Will you tell us why you disagree? It is my opinion that while she is at increased risk for different types of complications, the pregnancy itself is not life threatening. Your Honor, termination of pregnancy does not equate with non-survival of the fetus. Now, if appointed, we would develop the view that the question is not whether to terminate the pregnancy, but we would develop the facts as to when the pregnancy should be terminated, and how it can be done in a manner consistent with the survival of both mother and child. The testimony yesterday said that Mrs. Klein clearly planned this pregnancy. And she wanted to continue this pregnancy at the time of the accident. Someone else's substituted judgment cannot be placed in Mrs. Klein's mouth. Mr. Klein wants to terminate the pregnancy in a manner that would result in a dead baby. That is not Mrs. Klein's wish. ELEANOR: Does Your Honor wish to hear from the Attorney General? JUDGE: Yes. Counsel for Mr. Davis is arguing that the court should assume that since Mrs. Klein wanted this pregnancy, that by virtue of her having wanted it initially, she would choose to continue it under these circumstances. I think the fallacy of that argument is obvious. It is the constitutional rights and interests of Nancy Klein that are at issue in this courtroom, how best to protect them and exercise them. Thomas Miller has absolutely no connection to this family or to this case, which would grant him any special status to be appointed guardian. His papers make it clear that he is seeking to intervene for the sole purpose of advocating a particular philosophical or legal position. FRED: I'll take the tip. Thank you. Excuse me, I'm Tracy Jordan. You may remember I called your house yesterday about being on a TV panel to discuss abortion. -Thank you. -Thank you very much. Well? Miss Jordan, this might sound strange, but I don't have any views on abortion. We're just a family. I'm not an advocate of anything. This is going to be a network show. I just thought you might have things you'd like to say. At this moment, all I want to do is get on with the court business. Thank you. Just keep my number. In case you change your mind. Thank you. Insofar as the application of Mr. Miller to be guardian of the fetus is concerned, it is well settled law commencing with Roe v. Wade, that a fetus of less than 24 weeks is not a person and therefore, not afforded protection under the 14th Amendment. So, at best, the application is premature, and it is not necessary to address the other question as to what guardian would be the appropriate choice. As to the application of Mr. Davis to be appointed guardian of Mrs. Klein, the court finds Mr. Davis to have no standing in this matter, and his application is denied. Recognizing that time is of the essence in this particular hearing, so, all memoranda of law must be submitted by tomorrow. After studying them, I will render my decision as quickly as possible. This court stands adjourned. [ALL MURMURING INDISTINCTLY] Excuse me. I just want to tell you how much I sympathize with you and your family. Oh, thank you. I'm strongly opposed to abortion, but my heart goes out to you. Oh! WOMAN: Doctor's office. Yes, good evening. This is Martin Klein. May I talk to the doctor please? One moment please. Mr. Klein I've been expecting your call. How are things going? It's really hard to tell. But Dr. Cannon suggested I contact you because we might get a decision as early as Monday, one way or the other. When you know, make contact with your OB/GYN Dr. Kay, who will contact me and also make the arrangements at the hospital. I contact her and she contacts you? I don't want you to think that I'm being coy about this not giving you my name. I do this procedure almost every day of my life. It's all I do. But in this case, my family has tried to persuade me not to take it on. The possible notoriety. Repercussions from the crazies for me and my family. I understand. And I very much appreciate this. Thank you. Good luck. I'll be waiting. Herb called, wants you at the courthouse at 8:30 tomorrow. -Do you have word? -In case we win, Davis and Miller have started the appeals process. How can they appeal when there's been no decision? I recognize that this is premature since the decision of the lower court will not be handed down until later today, but... Your Honor, this is not only premature, this is preposterous. I mean, they have been denied standing in the lower court... I understand the decision from the lower court will be handed down at noon. Now, if you people say, as soon as you get the decision, if it's in your favor, you're going to go ahead with the abortion at once, I will grant a temporary stay of that order right now. If, however, you agree not to go ahead immediately, I will call you into the courtroom at 2:00 p.m. I will go over the facts, and I will let you know if I grant a stay pending a hearing before the full appellate court. [REPORTERS CLAMORING] Excuse me. Excuse me. Pardon me. Pardon me. Based on competent medical testimony and records, the court finds that Nancy Klein is incapable of communicating and is declared to be incompetent. Also, based on credible, and convincing medical testimony, the court finds that as of this time, an abortion is not medically necessary to preserve the life of Nancy Klein. However, Nancy Klein who is comatose and approximately 17 weeks pregnant, has the same constitutional rights as any otherwise healthy, approximately 17 weeks pregnant woman. [SIGHS] Therefore, the Court appoints Martin Klein -as guardian to Nancy Klein. -[ALL MURMURING] The Court notes that considering the underlying very serious brain injury and the undisputed medical testimony as to the high risk to Nancy Klein's life in undergoing this type of contemplated abortion procedure, the responsibility of the guardian is awesome. -[GAVEL POUNDS] -This court stands adjourned. MARTY: Oh, God. They're appealing. This afternoon they're appealing. Your Honor, I understand the sensitivity of this case. However, the applications of Mr. Miller and Mr. Davis fly in the face of constitutional doctrine, and if granted would violate the civil liberties of Nancy Klein. It's a woman's constitutional right to beget and bear children and not have her judgment dismissed by someone else! Miss Garner, restrain your client please. He's a stranger. This man is a stranger. These men are strangers. -Mr. Klein... -They are absolute strangers! [GAVEL POUNDING] How can they be able to come in here and be allowed to ruin my life? [SHOUTING] What do you want from me? Want do you want from us? They don't know my wife! They don't know me! They don't know my baby! What do you want? This is my court, sir. Marty, please. Your Honor, I apologize for my client. The justices of the court will meet tomorrow and consider the case, and render a decision as to whether or not a permanent stay should be granted. Meanwhile, I will grant a temporary stay of the order. [GAVEL POUNDS] -Daddy! Daddy! -No, no, not now, dear, please. Let's you and I go and check the kitchen cabinets, huh? Okay. [CHUCKLING] Elephant. [TELEPHONE RINGING] Hello? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, hold on a second. It's Tracy Jordan. She thought with the new developments, you might have changed your mind about doing the television show. If I don't have to talk to Davis or Miller, if I don't have to listen to them, I'll do it. Good. Yeah. When? What time? No, here. It will be more comfortable. All right, I'll call you. [OVER PHONE] Hey Stan, it's Marty. I keep sitting here staring at my desk. Have you heard anything yet? No, nothing. Everything is on hold. I'm leaving for home in about half an hour. You want a lift? You know, that would be great. Thanks. See you, buddy. [SIGHS] [CAR PHONE RINGING] -Hello? -MAN: Martin Klein, please. Marty is not here. This is Bradley from the wire service. I've got the ruling. He is here. I'll let you tell him. A reporter. A guy named Bradley. They have the word. Hello, Mr. Bradley. Mr. Klein, I called your house. They told me where to find you. The justices met. Here's Marino's decision. "Ultimately, the record confirms "that these absolute strangers to the Klein family "whatever their motivation, "have no place in the midst of this family tragedy." Do you have any comment? Uh, no. No comment. Thank you very much. [DIALING] -[LINE RINGING] -WOMAN: Doctor's service. Yes, this is Martin Klein. May I speak to Dr. Kay? Dr. Kay is not in her office. This is her service. Would you care to leave a message? No, the doctor said that she would have her beeper with her and if I called, you'd put me through to her. I'm sorry. I can't disturb her unless you tell me what it is about. No... Just tell her that Martin Klein called, okay? She knows exactly what it's about. She's waiting to hear from me. All right. [SINGING IN FRENCH] Is that... Oh, Marty. Honey, I'm so relieved for you. -Thanks, thanks. -Grandma Fran taught me to play. No kidding. Let me hear. Thanks. There we go. [SINGING IN FRENCH] Arielle, I'll be right back, okay? Okay. Okay. [TELEPHONE RINGING] Hello? Can I speak with Mr. Klein, please? This is Bradley again. Hold on. It's that reporter, Bradley. What's going on? You are not gonna believe this. They've gone to the Court of Appeals in Albany. What? They've gone to the Court of Appeals in Albany. They've got a temporary stay. Stevenson is at the hospital giving them the word. -Any comment? -No. What? They've gone to the Appeals Court in Albany. They got a temporary stay. Stevenson is at the hospital right now giving them the word. I'm going to kill him! Easy, easy. All right, all right, all right, all right! Chief Judge, Court of Appeals, Albany, New York. Sir, I can find no better summation of this entire tragedy than to refer to the final words in today's New York Timeseditorial. "What Mr. Davis and Mr. Miller want "is to impose their convictions "on a heartsick family." "They may preach the sanctity of life. "What they practice in its name is savagery." [TELEPHONE RINGING] Hello? Hello, Marty. Listen, I just got the news. The Court of Appeals ordered that leave to appeal is denied and motions of stay are dismissed as academic. Congratulations. Get going. Thank you. We're on. -Oh! -Oh, Marty. [LAUGHING] [ENGINE STARTS] [TIRES SCREECHING] DR. X: You're not going to read it? For two days I heard about the risks and the dangers in court. R.J. trusts you. I just want to get on with this. Tonight, we implant the laminaria to relax the cervix. And tomorrow morning... We would like you to sign a consent form for me, too. I'll only be assisting, but. By the authority vested in me by the Supreme Court of New York, the Appellate Court and the Court of Appeals. Take good care of her. See this gets to Justice Marshall, Bob. Thank you. City Desk, this is Bradley. Yeah, they've gone to the Supreme Court. Mmm-hmm. Yeah, the procedure started but they say it can be reversed. Everything is fine. I'll be back in the morning, around 9:00. The hospital is giving out word that the procedure can be reversed. If they want a 10 million dollar lawsuit on their hands. Thanks. If people would tend their own gardens... [TELEPHONE RINGING] Public information, Kay Ford. WOMAN: Kay, Judge Marshall denied the stay in the Klein case. -Marshall denied it? -That's right. All right. I'll get that out. Have a good weekend. You too. Bye. Here you go. Justice Scalia? Yes, sir. So what are you going to say on television? I don't know. I shouldn't have agreed to it. Yesterday, I wanted to sound off. Let America know. You know, I'm told that Stevenson is a fine man, distinguished lawyer, gave up a hot career to take on this cause. Yeah, crusaders were all fine fellows too, galloping across Europe, killing everyone who didn't see things their way. Yeah. You know, in spite all this hoopla, we're still at square one? No one seems to know how Nancy is going to do. BRADLEY: Well, what about the Scalia appeal? I don't know anything about the appeal going to Justice Scalia. Well, we have word that when Marshall turned it down, they took it to Scalia. I suggest you ask your informant with whom the appeal was left. We've been closed down for several hours. I'll check the clerk's office. [TELEPHONE RINGING] Security. CLERK: A reporter called about an envelope to Justice Scalia. What do you know about it? It's not marked "Urgent." Nobody said anything about an emergency. Well, it is now. Okay, I'll get it to him right now. What is this? [REPORTER TALKING INDISTINCTLY] MARTY: Now what? STAN: God, there's a lot of them. -[REPORTERS CLAMORING] -[CAMERAS CLICKING] -The hospital says it's begun. -Yes. -But they say it can be reversed. -No. What if Scalia grants a stay? Their appeal went to Marshall and he turned them down. Then they took it to Scalia. I haven't heard about that. But you say it can't be reversed. So the doctors say. It was started anyway before appeal was in place. -MALE REPORTER: How do you feel? -Bushed. How do you feel about the Right-To-Lifers? -How do you feel about the Right-To-Lifers? -Excuse us! Mr. Klein, answer, please. We thought you'd never get here. Hi, I was getting scared. We've got 10 minutes to air time. What about Davis? He's on the first segment. We're setting you up over by the fireplace. You're not gonna wear that on television. No, no. Go change. Please. Please. ARIELLE: [ON MONITOR] ♪ Itsy bitsy spider went up the water spout ♪ Down came the rain and washed the spider out ♪ Out came the sun and dried up all the rain, ♪ And the itsy bitsy spider went up the spout again ♪ [ARIELLE LAUGHS] [PEOPLE APPLAUDING] [KNOCK ON DOOR] Come in. Word just came in. Scalia denied the appeal. [SCOFFS] That's good. They want you. Our position is, you do everything possible to protect the life of the mother and at the same time preserve the life of a child. MALE INTERVIEWER: And what if you can't do both? There are no conditions where you can't do both. MALE INTERVIEWER: Oh, yes, there are. Yes, cancerous uterus, you do what you can. No way is a child possibly gonna survive. But we're talking right now about a woman who's doing well. Stable in her coma. The child is growing and developing well. And that child in a week or so could be delivered live. Now what happens when she wakes up and asks, "Where is my child?" There is no reason for anyone to go in and crush that child's skull and cut that baby to pieces and suck it out of the mother. MALE INTERVIEWER: Next, the man who has been faced with making the agonizingly personal decision, in this case, Nancy Klein's husband, Martin Klein. MAN: Marty, can we get this on you? [PEOPLE SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] MAN 1: Stand by, people. MAN 2: Okay, we're ready. MAN 1: Quiet please. Clear the background. That's fine. Stand by, in five, four, three, two... -Good evening, Mr. Klein. -Good evening. It seems that Mr. Davis finally got his vivid details on national television. Mr. Klein, Mr. Davis, and Mr. Miller suggested that you could have had two lives, your wife's and the child's. Dr. Cannon found only two instances of women in coma... Traumatic coma, who gave birth. As he put it, "Two women gave birth to two babies. "Two mamas died." I couldn't take the risk of letting Nancy become a statistic in the literature of coma and pregnancy. Several doctors gave their opinions that your wife was in no danger from the pregnancy. Actually, what they said was "No immediate danger." By definition that means that she won't die tomorrow. What are we supposed to do? Wait for the emergencies and then hope we can handle them? Besides that, nobody understands. There is nothing to do. There's no operation. No medicine. This wonderful woman is lying there and she has to do it all of herself, she has to mend herself. [VOICE BREAKING] She needs all of the energy for herself. Certainly no one who has not been in your tragic position could question... They questioned. They came in and questioned. They had no legal standing when they came in there. I respect their right to differ. But I do not respect zealots who come in and burn your house down literally or figuratively. They set fire to our lives as if they had set a torch right to us. I made a decision. I will have to live with it. I am not insensitive. It's my child. But if we had lost in the court, and Nancy was forced to carry the child to full term and died, I would have killed. [POLICE RADIO CHATTER] [POLICE SIREN WAILS] They started early. Everything went well. No problems. DR. KAY: Nancy's in the recovery room. You can see her in a little while. Thank you. Good luck. Somehow she looks so much more peaceful. Maybe it's just the way that I see her. DOCTOR: Hmm. We'll evaluate responses to speech, movement, visual stimuli, over a long period of time. You'll have to start measuring time not in days or months, but years. Time I've got.
