( dramatic theme playing ) ( men indistinctly chattering ) MAN: Hey, you guys, over here. Haven't you finished the McKinley assay yet? Yeah. I just want to make sure. They really struck high-grade ore this time. Yeah. CHARLIE: - Larkin? - What? What's the matter with you lately? Nothing. Oh, come on, we've been friends too long for that. You're jumpy. I don't hold a grudge against you. No woman's worth it. Listen, Charlie, you leave Josephine out of this. Heh. She's a very expensive girl. I ought to know. What are you going to use for money? Don't worry, Charlie. I'll make out. That's just it, you won't. All right, up with them. Don't try any funny stuff. What the devil? That's better. All right, let's have it, mister. There's only a little payroll money left. Who said anything about money? Go on, take it. It belongs to the afternoon shift. Who's talking to you? Break it out. The McKinley assay. I don't know what you're talking about. What is this? How do they know about that? Always thought it was a secret, huh? Well, it ain't, see. We haven't got all day. Where is it? It isn't made up yet. No? I'll just have a look at this. Keep out of that! So ain't made out yet, eh? Assayer's report on McKinley mining properties. Hey, that's no good to you. Let it be. Easy, mister. Well, if it's no good, then it won't hurt if I take it along, will it? Let's have a look at what you got in that tin can. - What? - You heard him, Moffatt. - No. - Yes. Unless you want a couple of holes in your stomach. Now get going. Larkin, you can't. I told you to keep out of it. - Leave him alone. - Hold it, Jim. We made a deal. No shooting. Unless we got to. Now pack it up. LARKIN: You won't get away with this. MAN: Oh, you're gonna tell the sheriff you made a deal to have us hold you up, huh? LARKIN: I made a mistake. That I'll pay for. Cut the gab. Now let's go. ( dramatic theme playing ) That Moffatt will sure be in hot water when Storrs comes to. ( train whistle blows ) He's following. ( tense theme playing ) ( train whistle blowing ) ( train whistle blowing ) ( train whistle blowing ) ( train whistle blowing ) ( train whistle blowing ) ( romantic theme playing ) Forget him, Charlie. I can't forget him, Josephine. We've been friends too long. Somehow I never thought he'd turn crooked. You know, it's not so long ago that you and he were-- That's over. If you really must know, Charlie, it was always you. I know one thing. I'll see that he never gets another chance. ( dramatic theme playing ) The boss wants to see you. ( upbeat theme playing ) RECRUITER: - Your name? - Bob Scott. Your name? Larkin Moffatt. Next man. ( knock on door ) Just in time, Miss Surrency. Is it good? Dad! The good Lord love us. Two thousand ounces of silver to the ton. Baby, we're rich. Are you sure you haven't made a mistake? Never ask an assayer if he made a mistake. He'll shoot you dead. We've got the world to move, Dad. Send Fuller down to the Silver Bell to pick up a crew. I'll meet you at the house later. Goodbye, Moffatt. Thanks. Now we'll talk, Mr. Moffatt. And you know what about. I can guess. You're getting 15 percent. No, just my assay fee. Who told Dad the stuff was at the crossed fault? I guess I did. You can fool some of this town, Mr. Moffatt. Why you want to is your own business. But you're a mining engineer, and a good one. I'm an assayer. Among other things, yes. But a mining engineer first. No jackleg miner or assayer could have told Dad where that stuff lay. A lot of them tried. You know what we're bucking now, don't you? Yeah, you've gotta get out a lot of ore in a hurry. Dad took out a six-month lease on the Big Jay. He agreed to pay Jarboe 7 percent royalty on everything he took out. He worked like a dog. Didn't even make expenses. Dad put everything he had into the Big Jay. Yeah, but now he's struck it rich. And there's only 12 days to take out the pay dirt. After that, it reverts back to Jarboe. Are you listening, Mr. Moffatt? I heard you. If every hour is so precious, why waste time on me? Because it's partly your money. I told you I want no part of it. Then why did you tell Dad where to look? You've made us a fortune. All right, we can't swing it in the time we've got. Dutch has been mining longer than I have. Mining, yes, but not fighting. What's fighting got to do with it? There's maybe a half a million in that pocket. Do you think Jarboe would rather take 7 percent of it or all of it? He owns the only mill in the neighborhood. After he moves our ore and sees the figures, do you think he'll let us take that out? There are ways around that. Name one. Keep your assay secret. Don't mill your ore. Lease a patch of ground next to the Big Jay and dump your ore on it. Run four, six-hour shifts of the best miners you can find in Silver City. Pay them anything they want. Drive them till they drop. No. They won't take orders from a woman. How about your foreman? I need a partner. I've been in this town three months. Nobody pays much attention to an assayer. But if I went to work for you, somebody might start checking up on me. If they did, you wouldn't want me around your place. Oh, I see. If you do, then leave me alone. We pay our way. You'll get a check for your share. You can burn it if you want to. Good night. ( piano playing western music ) MAN 1: Hi. MAN 2: Hi, Larkin. - Hi. - Whiskey. Did you hear about Dutch? Yeah. All right, all you miners. If you want a job, step up. Dutch hit it, huh? Right where it feels good. It was at a slip fault. Jarboe just plain missed it. Who spotted it? ( chuckles ): I don't know. Dutch, I reckon. How are you, Moffatt? Hello, Taff. Some luck, huh? Tough for Jarboe. That's the way it happens. Maybe Dutch will leave some for old RB. How much did it run to the ton? Dutch bought the assay. Ask him. Maybe I will. I'm making the same deal as I did at Mile High, gents. I'm Dutch's foreman. I'm hiring any man who wants $5 for a six-hour shift. - Six hours? - Six hours. But the way I'll work you, you'll wish it were four. Let me see your hands. Yeah, you'll do. Name? - Templeton. - Templeton. Next. Take a look at these. No souses on this job. Stay sober a couple of days, then come and see me. Next. ( indistinct shouting ) That's gonna get you a couple of broken ribs. ( indistinct shouting ) MAN 1: Come on, Arnie, let him have it. MAN 2: Kill him! MAN 3: That's it! Let him have it! MAN 2: Get up. MAN 4: Hit him, Arnie. MAN 5: Look out, look out! MAN 6: Look out, Arnie! All right, throw him out. Go tell Dutch Andy Freed will get a crew together. This may hurt a little. Oh. Ah, you'll be all right. Yeah. Two or three months. Some of you boys take him home. Get Mrs. Shocking for him. She's a good nurse. ( knock on door ) Oh, come in. I just left Spence Fuller. How badly is he hurt? He's got some cracked ribs. Three at least. Well, he'll be all right if it's only ribs. Sure, in a couple of months. Yeah. It's a fine time for that to happen. - Who did it? - A drunken miner. Fuller was hiring... when he told a man to sober up, the trouble started. - Have some coffee. - Thanks. Any other time but now. He couldn't wait a week. Twelve days. Afraid to ask him, Dad? What? I will if you won't. Dad's wondering what I'm wondering. This accident of Fuller. Couldn't it make you change your mind? No. Well, you said it wasn't the money. So it must be whatever you're hiding from. How bad is it? Did you kill somebody? No. Just that I can't handle the job. It's out of my line. Dad says not. Candace and I have talked about it, and we think you have the experience we can use. I'm an assayer. Good night. - Good night. - Good night. ( door slams ) ( dramatic theme playing ) How much were you paid to beat up Spence Fuller? I don't know what you're talking about. How much? - Two dollars. - Who paid you? Bill Taff. You work too cheap. ( upbeat theme playing ) MAN 1: Whoa. MAN 2: Ho. Let's have those bags, will you, driver? You call this a city? They do, I don't. They call it Silver City. And how long are we staying here? Oh, a couple of days. - A week at the outside. - A week? I couldn't stand it a week. JOSEPHINE: And they call this a hotel. CHARLIE: Let's go. Lucky we caught you still up. Evening, Moffatt. - Hello, Jarboe. - Heh. I never could understand this assaying business. You make a living from it? Only when I keep busy. Moffatt, I never beat about the bush. I prefer to beat it up. To make a long story short, I want that assay of Dutch Surrency's. How do you propose to get it? - Buy it. - Mm-mm. Put yourself in my place. The Big Jay is my mine. I leased it to Dutch, and he struck it rich. Now, what sort of a mine have I got? Rich or only middling rich? I got to know if I'm being bled white or just a dirty grey. So you think it's worth it to keep Dutch from moving that ore, huh? Now, whatever gave you that idea? Spence Fuller got a couple of broken ribs tonight. That's too bad, huh? And cheap. Just $2. You're a real son of a gun. What's your price? The same as Dutch's. Ask him. I did. His price is another six-months lease - on the Big Jay. - That's your answer. How would a thousand dollars sound to you, Mr. Moffatt? Good night, gentlemen. I've bought better men for less. He's got a hungry look, RB. Double the offer. Well, there are other ways. Dutch has got to mill that ore. You got a long nose. It gets longer when I smell something rotten. Keep your nose out of my business. Hmm. ( ominous theme playing ) ( knock on door ) Is Dutch around? He's gone up to the Big Jay. Tell him to watch Bill Taff and Jarboe. They paid that miner to beat up Spence. They're gonna fight. What are we gonna do about it? Just keep your head up. And another thing. Jarboe offered to buy that assay from me a little while ago for two thousand dollars. And? Dutch will have to guard his dump, search his miners, so they won't smuggle out ore for an assay. He can keep it from Jarboe for a week. Well, you've got this all figured out. Oh, yes. Well, have you figured out a way a sick man and a woman can do all that? You can hire men. But not you. I know. I'm leaving town. I'm sorry. I'm sure you are. ( suspenseful theme playing ) ( upbeat theme playing ) Candace Surrency. Hello, Mrs. Barber. - Is Tim around? - No. He said to tell you he'd have those timbers at the Big Jay this afternoon. - He's gone after them. - Good. Excuse me, Miss Surrency. I couldn't help hearing your name. You are the daughter of the man who made the big strike, aren't you? Dutch Surrency is my father, yes. I'm Charles Storrs. I represent the Coronet Metals and Mining Company. I just heard about your father's strike. But I don't recall running across the name Surrency in the claim office files at Apex. It's the Big Jay mine, Mr. Storrs. Oh, yes. We only lease it. Mr. RB Jarboe owns it. I've heard about the Big Jay. You have a long lease on it, I hope. A short one. What is the assay? That's our business, Mr. Storrs. How do you keep a secret like that? By milling our ore when the lease is up. Mr. Jarboe's the man you wanna see. Quite a girl. The best. Now, madam, about breakfast. My wife isn't feeling very well, and she's appreciate having it served in the room. She looked all right to me last night. Well, she's a little delicate. If she's too delicate to come downstairs, she's too delicate to eat. I'll lug no breakfast up those stairs. - I'll carry it up. - You won't neither. Breakfast is over two hours ago. Anything else troubling you, Mr. Storrs? Yes, your stubbornness. That troubles me too. Sometimes. ( slow theme playing ) ( door opens ) Might as well go back to bed, sweetheart. Stoneface will bring you no breakfast this morning. Probably couldn't eat it if she did. How long are we staying here? Till my business is finished. Hurry it up. You were the one that wanted to come along, weren't you? Ah, go away. ( dramatic theme playing ) Mr. Jarboe. Huh? I'm Charles Storrs. - That's Taff. - Howdy Howdy. You Coronet fellas shopping around here now? We like to pick up any missed bets. Heh. You've come to the right place. Thanks. What's Surrency turned up? Wished I knew. It's your mine, isn't it? Can't keep you off your own property. They can keep me from taking out enough ore to make an assay. Do you want to sell? Why, yesterday morning I would have sold, but now I don't know. I'd sell anything at the right price, but I don't know what the Big Jay is worth now. You Coronet fellas want to buy? We'll buy anything at the right price. But I won't buy a mine that I can't look at or whose ore I can't assay. Well, we tried to buy the assay, but the fellow who made it wouldn't sell. Maybe if we offered him all the Coronet work for the next two years, he'd change his mind. I don't know. He's a funny fellow. Every man has his price, Jarboe. I know that, but I don't know what his price is. If you let me try this, I'd soon find out. Let's go over and see him. Yeah. It isn't right. It's my mine, and I have a right to know. Of course you have. If Moffatt skipped, he's sold out to Surrency. Did you say Moffatt? Not Larkin Moffatt. TAFF: Know him? Yeah, I know him. So this is where he came, huh? Josephine will never believe it. That man's a crook, Jarboe. I wouldn't let him assay a tin cup for me. And how is Moffatt a crook? How? I worked with him a year ago. We had a report on a rich piece of property. One day, a couple of men walked in with guns and held us up. They took that report. Now, what's wrong with that if they got the drop? They didn't. I mean, they had the drop all right. But they knew about that report. There's only one man that could have told them. - Moffat. - Or you? It wasn't me. And it wasn't me who sold the assay to Pacific Shares for 40,000. Hmm. Not bad, not bad. It looks like he's run again. Yeah, he probably saw us come into town last night. Well, maybe he left the assay - around here somewhere. - Hold it. Was the Surrency assay the last job that Moffatt did? Yeah, I guess so. You wouldn't know the size of the sample that Surrency brought to Moffatt, would you? I heard Spence Fuller tell. A fifth assay ton. Wait a minute. Don't touch a thing. Three point seven nine-six milligrams. You know anything about assay work? Not a thing. No, never could understand it. You see this? That's the weight of a gold button. Here he's written down the weight of the silver and the gold button combined that he cooked out of the ore. Moffatt dissolved the silver in nitric acid, which doesn't touch gold. Now, subtract the weight of the gold from the total amount, and we'll find out just how much silver was dissolved by the acid. Is it good? Good? Two thousand ounces to the ton. Your Surrency is a rich man, Mr. Jarboe. Now don't do that, Bill, these things cost money. ( ominous theme playing ) It does a man good to let off a little steam sometimes. ( upbeat theme playing ) ( horse snorts ) I'll have two pounds of ten-penny nails, please. Deal me out. It's no use, I'm not going back. I didn't follow you here. I just happened to be riding this way. How'd you know I'd be here? A trader from Apex said he passed you last night. Your Coronet story is out. All of Silver City knows it by now. Any opinion? No opinion. Being a crook doesn't necessarily mean a man's not good at his job. What I really wanted to ask you about is, what do you want done with your assay stuff? Your place is wrecked. Wrecked? Completely. Everything inside smashed. Who did it? Bill Taff, Jarboe, a man name Storrs. Charlie Storrs, yeah. Wasn't satisfied with hounding me. He's gonna break up everything I own. Miss Surrency, you got yourself a foreman yet? Yeah, I think so. Who is he? Larkin Moffatt. ( upbeat theme playing ) Something I can do for you? You know now who I am? Get out. Go tell Taff and Jarboe. Hello, Larkin. Have you got a Charlie Storrs here, Mrs. Barber? Take your trouble outside, Larkin. Besides he isn't here. But there's his fine wife, just come down for breakfast. ( romantic theme playing ) How are you, Josephine? Used to be worth a kiss, Larkin. Charlie said you'd run away again. Not this time. How long has it been since we've seen each other? Since I ran away from the Coronet. How's the world treated you? I haven't seen very much of it. I've looked at a lot of it. You knew about Charlie and me. You have my best wishes. ( suspenseful theme playing ) Stand up, Moffatt. Hello, Charlie. Are you in on this too or are you just tagging along? Get his gun. You better move, lady. - Shall I, Larkin? - Yes. Bill Taff, you take your fight outside. Shut up. He won't fight, he'll run. You did all right against Donny with a chunk of ore. But I don't think you're so good. You wouldn't take a chance on that, would you? All right, boys, let's make it even. - The-- I-- - Sit down! You too. All right, take him. ( indistinct chattering ) Jarboe, you'll pay for this. ( glass breaking ) I wanna talk to you. ( suspenseful theme playing ) Maybe now we can get to work. ( chuckles ) ( upbeat theme playing ) It's 12:00. You must be hungry. I was never hungrier. Ah. Thanks, I've eaten. How's the work going? The chute will be finished by the time the midnight shift gets here. Then we can start moving ore. Good. Thanks for the help yesterday. You're an employee. If you got hurt, you wouldn't have been much good to us. That's right. Strictly a matter of business, huh? You've got a grudge against Charlie Storrs. That's why you took this job. Dad and I are fighting Jarboe. That's why we hired you. I think we understand each other. By now everybody in Silver City has heard the story that Charlie Storrs has been spreading about me. But he didn't say that I sent back the money the two hold up men took. No, he didn't. And I never got any part of the $40,000 for that assay. ( knock on door ) - Hello, Miss Surrency. - Hello. How are you, Mrs. Storrs? I came here on business. Before we discuss that, I wanna say I resent what you said in the hotel yesterday. Since when have I ever tagged along with three men to watch them beat up one man? I guess you're right, Charlie. I apologize. I think you had other things on your mind. I did. One was how to face a town after the story you told. Did I lie about anything? No. It's what you left out that makes it so tough. Did you come up to look over the Big Jay? Legally you can't keep me out. Go ahead. Well, I thought since you were keeping the assay a secret... We've got no secrets from you. Especially the assay. Here's written permission from Jarboe to examine the property. Do you mind if Josephine stays with you? Not at all. I don't think she'd enjoy the mine. Won't you sit down? Thank you. I think most of the arguments start because of Charlie. This one did, anyway. Because of what he told about Larkin? Yes. That's unforgiveable. Can't a man make a mistake without having it haunt him all his life? That was the trouble. It haunted him too long. Now it doesn't since it's out in the open. Larkin can be dangerous at times. I came along because I thought he might try to fight Charlie. Oh, I don't think you have to worry about that anymore. You don't know Larkin. Mrs. Storrs, I'm interested in Larkin Moffatt only as my father's foreman. But that well I do know him. You don't know him as well as I do. That's what you keep telling me. How well did you know him? Figure it out for yourself. He asked me to marry him. Really? I wonder what could have made him change his mind. You won't be buying that. Here's what you want. This is going to take a little time. I wanna mark out some ore for mill tests. How much? Two on the first level, three here. Two on each level, let us say. Let's not say. That's 10 ton. How will you move it? Same way you move it. This mine was leased with all its equipment. That means track cars, hoist machinery 24 hours a day. You put any men down here, I'll run over them. I'm not moving any ore for Jarboe. If I can't move it, how am I going to test? That's your problem. Oh, I see. Letting me in here didn't mean a thing then. Did you think it would? If I wanna test, then I'll have to wait until the lease is up. Is that it? I'll send back no recommendation to buy up property or put up a mill on the results of a 40-pound assay. Suit yourself. Goodbye, Larkin. It's been like old times. Bye. Open for business? Man, oh, man. Ha-ha-ha. You ought to be in bed. I'm all right. Well, did you get into the Big Jay? Just about. What's he got, a pocket? A big one, as far as I can see. Is he robbing it? Gutting it. Who wouldn't? He'll have the chute finished by tomorrow. What chute? Didn't you know? He's building a chute to slide the stuff to the next property. But that's 250 feet. All of it. But don't you see? He'll stack it there and won't mill it until the lease is up. Oh, he must be building a trestle over the wash. Heh. He better hope he don't get a good rain. Ha. Of course, you know, this cools our deal, don't you, Jarboe? I was afraid of that. You leaving? No, I think I'll stick around until Dutch's lease is up. Do that. Good night. You better get some sleep. Well, how you feeling? Ah, not very good. Look, RB, I'm not scared of him. I'm not scared of any man that walks on two feet. But the next time he comes after me, I want a finger free to go inside a trigger guard. Yeah, I'm getting poorer every hour. Well, you won't get any richer beating up Moffatt. Yeah, but he's taking out my ore. If it would only rain. Maybe we can make it rain. ( suspenseful theme playing ) You think so, huh? ( upbeat theme playing ) You won't have to do this much longer. Oh, I don't mind it. What do you do once you're rich? Buy myself some chickens. ( both laugh ) I'm glad you didn't let Storrs bait you. When you didn't get mad, he lost his advantage. Something he doesn't like to lose. His wife doesn't like to lose it either. What happened between you two when we were down in the mine? Just talk. And she told you we were to be married? Yes, she mentioned it. I ran out before the marriage, Candace. I made the deal to sell the McKinley assay because of her. I wanted to give her everything she never had. But I couldn't go through with it. I knew that if I did, I'd do anything for her. Can you understand that? Yes, I guess I can. I would have stolen for her, lied for her, killed for her. And I think she would have let me. Could it--? Could it happen to you again if she weren't Mrs. Storrs? No. Well, then it turned out all right. Go on, say it, Larkin. Say what? There ought to be a law against meddling women like me. New shift didn't show up. - None of them? - Not a single one of them. Jarboe. ( ominous theme playing ) ( piano playing and men indistinctly talking ) ( indistinct chattering and laughing ) ( indistinct shouting ) ( man laughing ) MAN: Good one. MALONE: You're at Big Jay, aren't you? I'm at Big Jay too, Malone, what does it get me? - Free drinks. - Who's paying? Bill Taff. He made a bet. Bought a barrel of booze from me. Said pass it out to the Big Jay crew. Of course you know this is my noon shift you got soused. Fire them. Plug up the barrel. Look, Moffatt, you run your mine, I'll run my saloon. ( piano playing and indistinct chattering ) Ed, what can you rent me that will hold 10 to 12 men? You want something with style? Something with high sides for a bunch of drunks. And I'll need a good driver too. An oil wagon is what you want. And I'm your driver. Hitch it up. How much for the lot? Two dollars. ( Ed laughing ) ( indistinct chattering and piano playing ) ( men indistinctly speaking ) Looking for trouble? I wanna speak to Andy Freed, my hoist man. What for? I don't wanna spoil their fun, so send him outside alone, will you? Here. Buy yourself a cigar. You want me? I don't. The fellow inside said you wanted me. Sounds like Tim Malone is trying to ease you boys out, huh? What's he wanna do that for? Bill Taff paid for a barrel of whiskey. If Malone can ease you out with only a quarter of a barrel, or half a barrel, he can sell the rest of the whiskey again. - Ah, dirty-- - Wait a minute. Malone's got a couple of bouncers in there, and they use clubs. Here, better take one of these. There are a lot more clubs here. Better send the rest of the boys out one at a time. Yeah. Yeah, sure. ( indistinct shouting and glass breaking ) Take your money and throw you out, huh? That's a fine business. Throw me out, will he? Give me that club. Come on, fellas. MAN: Give me one of them club. There you are. There it is, boys. Get to work. ( indistinct shouting and glass breaking ) ( whistles ) Why, you... This is some of your work. I'll kill you for this. ( men indistinctly shouting ) What's going on in there? Just a friendly fight, Ed. LARKIN: Come on-- Go. Better get aboard. ( dramatic theme playing ) Boiled potatoes again for lunch? Yeah, good ones too. There's no such thing as a good boiled potato. You're gonna be as big as a moose before we get out of here. Where are you going this afternoon? I'm going up near the Big Jay to look at some property. You wanna come along? No. What'll you do? Oh, I can use up an hour in the dining room pushing those boiled potatoes around my plate. Then I can go look over the mops, pans and axes in both stores. Then I can walk till I'm out of breath. Then I can sit in the lobby for an hour. You have a tough lot. Why don't you meet some women? Mrs. Barber? How often can I get insulted in a day? There's that Surrency girl. Charlie, really. You wanted company, didn't you? Not that kind. Bye. I'm not your cousin, sweetheart. Put some catsup on those boiled potatoes. It helps. ( romantic theme playing ) Afternoon, dearie. Have a nice sleep? On that bed? Hello, Josephine. You better hurry up if you want some lunch. Oh, I'm not a bit hungry, really. In fact, I've got an errand to run. Come along? I lied, Larkin. I haven't got an errand, I was just bored stiff. Charlie's gone off for the afternoon. Can I tag along with you wherever you're going? I'm sorry, I've gotta go over to my shack. Clean it up, get a few things. I'll help you. I'll be good. Charlie should be ashamed of this. Maybe he is. I won't be more than a couple of minutes. What kind of people are they? - Who? - The Surrencys. Who else? The best. How old is she? Candace? She's about 21, I guess. Just a baby. There are no baby women, like there are no baby tigers. Yes, I'd noticed that about her too. She's hard and catty. She can take care of herself, if that's what you mean. Well, I don't like her. That's your privilege. - Larkin. - Yeah? Just wondered if you'd forgotten I was here. How could anyone forget that? Charlie does, often. Charlie concentrates too hard. On everything but me. I made a mistake, Larkin. A terrible mistake. - And so did you. - Take it easy now. Why did you run out on me? I had to. You were no good for me. Oh, Larkin. Larkin. It's that Surrency girl. You fool. ( suspenseful theme playing ) - Who are you men? - We're new. Dutch told us to report for work. All right, come on. This way. We'll be along in a minute. Now. If you're taking orders from me. Well, maybe we ain't taking orders from you. Stand back and keep quiet. Andy Freed! MAN 1: Is that you, Larkin? LARKIN: Come a-runnin'! MAN 2: Look out, dynamite! LARKIN: Come on, men! They're trying to blow us up! Hurry up! Get out of the way! Run, run for cover! MAN 4: Look out! Go on, get out! MAN 5: All right, get out of here. Come on! All right, come on, men. ( suspenseful theme playing ) MAN: What you fellows want? TAFF: Nothing that concerns you. I wonder how much ore they'll move tomorrow. ( gunshot ) MAN: Come and get us if you want lead. You won't get away with this. He's bluffing. They won't shoot. Rush them! ( dramatic theme playing ) ( indistinct shouting ) - It's gone. - We'll build it again. It'll take two days. We drive that much harder, that's all. All right, men. Come on, let's start moving. Get this thing cleaned up. Well, where have you been? I sleep once in a while. Oh, when you knew I was waiting to hear. It's all around town. All right, so you heard. Saves me telling you. Yes. And I also heard that Moffatt has rounded out a timber crew. They're working on a new chute. They can't get enough timber. Not soon enough. They got it. There isn't that much timber in town. They'll have to get it from the Miller place at Cedar Flat. I'm telling you they got it. They tore down the bunk house and cook shack at my Mile High Mine. I'm getting poorer every hour. Ah, your brains are getting softer every hour too. And how was your brain? Firm, hard, cold. Put it to work. I have. When I said a good rain would wash out the ore chute, you said you'd make it rain. You did, with dynamite. It won't set them back for 24 hours. There are still seven days left on the lease. At the end of seven days, there'll not be enough silver left to fill your teeth. There's just one thing left to do. Kill him. ( suspenseful theme playing ) Oh, no. I don't like that. For a million dollars, you can learn to like it. No, I'm an old man, Bill. A rich old man. I don't even own a gun. A rich man who never owned a gun. I-- I wouldn't know how to use it. A rich man who wouldn't know how to use it. What are you getting at? Just that you're rich. A rich man doesn't make his own clothes. He doesn't cook his own food. He buys it done. I see. Yes. And how much would it cost a rich man for that? A thousand dollars? How much? Half of what you get out of Dutch's strike after Moffatt's dead. And what if I didn't pay after it happened? You'll pay. I wouldn't want to know anything about it. - That's my word. - No, I forbid you to do it. I won't give my permission in any way, shape or form. Still if something did happen to Moffatt and Dutch had bad luck, well, that would leave you open to be my partner in mining out the Silver Pocket. That's right. This is gonna hurt you more. I'll need some money now. I'll need more than $5. There's 200 there in gold. How are you today, Mrs. Storrs? Been walking? Is there any law against it? I'll tell you more about it when I get your ore samples. TAFF: Hello, Mr. Storrs. Oh, hello, Bill. Have a drink. - No, thanks. - You know Mark Dacy. I'm trying to steal his claim. I wouldn't call it stealing. That is unless, uh, you pull a gun on me first. Hear about the bad luck they had at the Big Jay last night? Yeah. Tough on Moffatt. I've known him for a long time. Yeah. Mrs. Storrs has too. Yes. Mrs. Storrs has too. Just saw her coming from that way. The Big Jay? No. Moffatt's shack in town. - I say something wrong? - Did you? Not that I know of. I just said I saw her coming from Moffatt's place. Guess maybe I'm talking out of turn. Are you talking out of turn? Well, Charlie, I'll be seeing you. What's the matter? You said yourself you'd know him for a long time. When I seen her yesterday, I... You saw my wife yesterday? Where? Same place. Coming out of Moffatt's. All right. I apologize. I don't wanna fight you, Storrs. - You're a liar. - All right, I'm a liar. ( indistinct chattering ) If a man can't trust his wife, why don't they lock her in a room? ( all laughing ) ( romantic theme playing ) Just going down to lunch. Didn't think you'd be back. We're going to have a scene again. All right, sweetheart. Tell me. What have you been up to while my back's been turned? If you're trying to scare me, you can stop it! I just slapped down Bill Taff in the Silver Bell Saloon for insulting you. How brave you are. What'd he say about me? You don't know? I passed him on the street-- Where were you coming from? From Larkin's place. Didn't you see enough of him yesterday? As a matter of fact, I didn't. - We quarreled and I left. - Quarreled? About Candace Surrency. I teased him about her and he got angry and so did I. So I went back this morning to apologize. Why should you apologize to that crook for anything? Charlie, are you jealous of Larkin? Should I be? I'm trying to tell you you saw him twice behind my back. Why shouldn't I? You never pay any attention to me. You're always away. Here we go again. So now you're neglected then. - All right, I'm neglected. - Well, go home then. I'm neglected at home too. - Look, Josephine, I'm trying-- - I know. I'll never speak to Larkin Moffatt again. If I see him, I'll spit in his face. I'll sit here in my room, and I'll darn your socks. If anybody knocks on the door, I'll hide under the bed. Shut up! Louder! They can't hear you downstairs! Are you through scolding me now for what some dirty-minded miner made up? If so, I'm still hungry. ( suspenseful theme playing ) - You, Bill? - How you feeling? I don't feel so good. My head hurts. You're lucky to have a head left. That chunk of rock Moffatt hit you with in the Saloon weighed 11 pounds. Sure gonna fix that Moffatt, when I feel better. There's $200 in that. I'll have another 200 for you tomorrow at the lumber mill in Cedar Flat. What's all the money for? I want Moffatt out of the way. If I could do the job myself without hanging for it, I'd do it. And me? I don't hang for it? Uh-uh. Another man does. - Who? - Charlie Storrs. Suppose he can prove he didn't do it? He can't tonight. Tonight? Why not tonight? Because I'm getting him out of town with a note. What's in the note? It'll tell him that if he really wants to find out what's going on between Moffatt and his wife, he'd better be waiting down at the bridge. Only I won't show up. Well, show me a hole in it. Once they got Storrs, I'll ride over to Cedar Flat, pay you the rest of the money and you drift along. Well, go on. Show me a hole in it. Sure need the money. Sure do. But I wanna fix Moffatt. All right, Candy. What's bothering you? Nothing, Dad. Nothing. Come on now. What is it? I said nothing. Look at me. I ran into Mrs. Hostetter before supper. Ha. Worst old gossip in Silver City. Was it about Larkin? Yes. Do you care? I've never cared more about anything in my whole life. All right, Puss. I'm going to tell you some things you heard and some things you probably didn't hear. Storrs came up to the mine this afternoon wild mad. Wanted me to leave so he could talk to Larkin. Did you? Well, not exactly. I went outside and around to a window. By that time, Storrs was threatening to kill Larkin if he ever talked to Mrs. Storrs again. He also said she admitted quarrelling with Larkin over a woman. A woman? What woman? You. ( knock on door ) Come in. Come in, Larkin. Come in. Pull up a chair and sit down. Hello, Candace. Hello. Well, we got the arm moving down the chute again. Great. I didn't think you'd get that fixed under two days. Oh, yeah. That's fine. Oh. Candace is a little upset. Say, I just remembered. I've got some bills I've just gotta get figured up tonight. ( romantic theme playing ) So you heard the talk about me and Josephine? Yes, I heard it. - And you believed it? - Should I? I told you she means nothing to me. You might have changed your mind. So you do believe it. Well, she did go with you to your place. Why should that upset you when you know what I told you? Maybe it's because what she said is true. That I'm after you too. How do you know she said that? Well, I don't know. But it's not hard to guess what she said. There's nothing much one woman can hide from another. And I'm not thanking you for making me say it. Why do you care whether I believed it or not? I guess I don't care what anyone thinks except you, Candace. ( romantic theme playing ) Oh, Larkin. I tried not to love you. ( clanging ) There's someone prowling around outside. Here. Give me that. ( suspenseful theme playing ) ( horse snorts ) ( horse neighing ) ( suspenseful theme playing ) ( rustling ) Hello? What you want? Are you the man who wrote me? Why should I write you? I'm Charlie Storrs. Yeah. You ain't see me none. Did a rider pass you hear, Charlie? - No. - You're lying. That's just about all I'll take from you. Is it? What are you doing here? That's my business. Think, Charlie. Did a rider pass you here? Yes. Ten minutes ago. A big fellow named Arnie took a shot at me tonight. I hope he didn't ride this way to meet you. If I wanted to shoot you, I wouldn't a hire it done. I'll find out. ( knock on door ) Who is it? CANDACE: Candace Surrency. ( suspenseful theme playing ) Your husband isn't here? He had to go out. - Do you know where? - He didn't say. Why do you want him? Someone shot at Larkin Moffatt. Is he hurt? No. Was it Charlie? That's what I came to find out. No. It wasn't Charlie. He wouldn't do that. You thought so a moment ago. And he threatened Larkin this afternoon. Mrs. Storrs, why don't you leave? Haven't you done enough harm here without getting Larkin killed? - Don't say that. - Why not? If your husband kills him, whose fault will it be? Charlie didn't try to kill him. After you've humiliated him in front of the whole town when he's half out of his mind with jealousy, when he's threatened already to do what he tried to do tonight. I've given him no cause for jealousy. That's a lie! You're in love with Larkin, aren't you? If you do love him, then why don't you leave? So you can have him? So Charlie won't kill him. Get out of here! ( suspenseful theme playing ) That Surrency girl just left here. She said someone shot at Larkin Moffatt. Pity he missed. Did you think you could hide it from me? Did you think you could come back to me with his blood on you hands? Just get-- This is Larkin you're talking about? If you hurt him, I'll kill you. I'll see you hang and I'll dance on your grave. Now I know. I don't need to wonder anymore. ( suspenseful theme playing ) What are you going to do? I'm going to clean up this business. Yes, your Larkin too. I didn't shoot at him. A man named Arnie did. Everybody in town knows it by now except you. There's some money. Go home. I don't wanna see you anymore. I wanna call it quits, Jarboe. You? I'm talking for my father. He knows you're here? No, but he'll back me up in any deal I make. We wanna give up the lease. Now? Now. You're offering to sell? No. I mean we'll tear it up. I've got nothing against Moffatt except that he's quarrelsome. Did you bring the lease with you? Well, there's a string tied to it. Oh, I knew there was a catch in it. The lease will be torn up when Moffatt's back safe and sound. Back from where, Miss Surrency? I don't know where he is. I think you tried to kill him. Maybe you have. Maybe he's lying in the brush somewhere. Slugged or stabbed or shot. All I know is you better bring him back here standing and breathing. I don't know where he is. How can I bring him back if I don't know? That's the string to the lease. No. Just a minute, Candace. Do I have to bring him back? If he just comes back himself, will you tear up the lease? Yes. Well, is he still alive? You made a bargain with me and you'll keep it. Not if he's alive. I keep the whole pocket if he's alive. If Arnie's got him, you'll keep your bargain. Well, call Arnie off. I know nothing about it. I told you I wanted nothing to do with it. I warned you. You'd sell me out. You're going to keep all of the Big Jay one way or another. No, Bill. No. It's all right, Bill. You... - Sure. - I stick to our bond. No, it's all right, Bill. It's all right. ( suspenseful theme playing ) Sure, RB. Sure. What are you so jumpy about? Where's Jarboe? He just left. Went down to his Mile High Mine. All right. I'll have to see him later. ( suspenseful theme playing ) ( machine whirring ) Hey, get off there! Get off! Get off there! ( train whistle blowing ) ( dramatic theme playing ) I guess this is it. Yes, it is, Charlie. I'm sorry for everything, Larkin. If Josephine hadn't interfered in it... I guess she couldn't help it. ( romantic theme playing ) Larkin. Larkin. Hello, Candace. Oh, I was so afraid. So afraid. ( chuckles ) It's all right. It's all right now. You're back, boy. That's good. I-- I got some figuring to do. I'll talk to you later. ( romantic theme playing ) Subtitles: Kilo
