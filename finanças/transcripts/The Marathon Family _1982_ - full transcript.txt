Balkan Film presents: "OUR GREAT KING KILLED" During his visit to Marseilles, France, our brave ruler Aleksandar... and the French foreign minister Barthou, his host, died from their wounds incurred in a brutal assasination. MARATHON MEN RUNS HONOURED ROUND Six months later - a small town in Serbia... My condolences... He is finished! Good day, priest Djuro... He was one long man. -Not long, he was tall! When he was alive, he was tall... as dead he is long. My dad says that every man has 3 measurments: Height, width and length. Pantelia Topalovic. COFFIN WORKSHOP "LONG HOSTEL" What is this: 2m and 28 cm? Length Which length?!? - Of the deceased, dad... 2m and 28cm...? - Yes. You can?t be sent anywhere! Idiot! Have you ever seen someone this long? Bungler! Where are your eyes? Where have you seen... Can?t you take simplest measurements? What?!? I wondered myself how he can be so big, but what can I do? Wait, did you accept the job? -Yes, you said that I should... I told you to measure a man, not a giant! Idiot! I will never again measure for you, so you know! You damm bastard... -I wont be good anymore! Sorry, Mr. Rajkovic, They're a little bit loud today... I will tell them to be a bit quieter... You will listen otherwise you won?t exist! -AJ! -What "AJ"? You will listen... Yes, you will... Daddy! You killed me!... You damm bastard... You will make my life miserable? What? If I hear you once more, I will cut off your heads with this saw! You disgrace the house, scare off customers! Daddy! Daddy! You damm bastards! - Milutin! What is it? What? Why are you shouting? As soon as I lay down a bit after dining... But daddy... - Shut up! You do this on purpose! You want to put me in the grave before my time! As soon as I close my eyes, you start shouting, noises, clammouring... Now you woke even daddy! Yes daddy! I just told them this! But you are bloody wrong my Sirs...! We are both indestructible! Those against us, are fucked straight away! I know what you concocted... -You want this bastard as a host! Him you praise and us two you push in to the grave, this is the plan! Grandad, don?t insult my child. Which child? This is a CRETIN! "My dear townsfolk, I am honoured to inform you that.." "Your cinema NEW EUROPE will be re-opened, with SOUND MOVIES!" Kids, here?s money for ice cream, but you have to run thru' the town, And announce that the cinema is re-opening. "Cinema re-opening!", cinema re-opening!" Here... Go now! "Cinema re-opening!" "Cinema re-opening!" Djenka! You are back - Yes. Who beat you like this? I taught him a lesson. I could teach you as well... You?ve got this cinema on his mind... so all decent jobs are so hard for him now! Where are those fuses I ordered? Here. - Is this all? All. You have reserves too, because your power is low. Wow, how did you fix that... Eh, I thought to invite all respectable folks next month, open the crematory officially, and introduce HIM as the owner. But the nerd isn?t interested in this! Mr. wants to be circus man. Crematories are the future in all civilised countries. Yes, this is true. I just saw this in Germany, whilst buying movies and searching for your fuses. People don?t want to be buried in mud and clod anymore. Cultural man doesn?t want to rot over the years. It?s finished with old burials. We have to keep in step with the whole world. All can go to ruin, can vanish, death is the only safe business... Laki! Laki, hurry up! -What is this now? He died whilst I gave him medicine... Grandad, grandad... Dont you dare tell daddy that his father died. This would kill him! For him, his daddy will live forever. We should inform his friends... His last friend died at the end of last century... Eh, grandpa, grandpa... My heart will break... Djenka, I will ask you something, but you have to answer truly, will you? Did you have anything with Kristina when she played in your cinema? With Kristina? Jesus! Are you mad? OK, sorry, just asked... Well, she can?t play anymore in the cinema. - Why? From this evening I will run sound movies only. Oh, I dont dare tell her this. She will be upset! This is for you. "Magazine"! But if she cares so, she can come to cinema this evening... and play during commercials. And say "Hi" from me. He stole the car. Grab him! Move grandpa! Return the car! - Wait! - Daddy! Stop! -Daddy! Stop! Stop! Daddy fell asleep, now we can tallk. What would you like to suggest, Laki? I told daddy this. - I don't know how to tell you... What is this about? Well, Laki thought - I didn?t think, I just suggest, you make a decision. How the hell can I decide when I don?t know what is this all about? SPEAK! Be quiet, you will wake grandpa. - He only knows how to shout! Laki thinks in a few days time... - No, tomorrow! Be silent! Be silent! Let him finish talking! That we cremate grandpa. That we, WHAT?!? - That we cremate Pantelija. To burn the deceased. In this oven?!? This is not an oven. This is the modernest crematory. Somebody has to be first. It would be most fitting for people, that one of us opens the crematory. Pantelija grounded, 100 years ago, this our firm and... It?s right that he has the honour, to start this new development. My son...: I agree that this thing should start to work, big money was invested... But I absolutely disagree that you learn with my granddad! Burn somebody else first, so I can see how it works... than you can burn him as well. This is the only way! You mean that I shold grab someone from the street and burn him...?!? Just to make you happy? - Easy, easy... I said what I had to say! I refuse any other way! Kristina! Kristina! Are you mad?!? Daddy nearly killed me last time when you drove in to the gate! But Djenka is back! I came to drive you to the cinema! Go to the hell, you idiot! It?s true Kristina, I swear! I was with him! Kristina! Stop getting on my nerves. Dont you see that I?m practising for the movie? What have I done, Kristina? -You breath in my ear like a donkey! You're lying that he is back. You never believe anything I say! Why? Come, lets go to the cemetry, I have to tell daddy where I am. Leave.. Leave me alone, you stupid jerk! I told you 100 times: Until I marry, men don?t exist for me! But... I love you! Really, you love me? I love you too, but I dont?molest you! Dear audience, as you have been informed by the posters in town... This evening sees a premiere in our cinema, SOUND MOVIES! Sound movies are a perfection of movie art and technology... Sound movies are the eyes and ears of the world! Balkan Film presents: Produktion: Art-Film Belgrad "STORY OF ONE DAY" "ALSO TAKING PART IN THE MOVIE:" "A forgotten BOUQUET OF ROSES..." "One pair of the LACK-SHOES..." Congratulate Djenka! What's up with you? Are you sad because you dont play? To hell with your sound movie! SILENCE! She?s playing a bit now! You are not normal! You are not normal! Yes, I am! -What "I am", you ruined me! You ruined me too! I was good until you got this squawking! OUT! GET OUT! ROTTEN BANDITS! GET OUT! Kristina, my dear! And you Topalovic! Get married or leave her alone! Come on... Mirko is coming... I?ll kill him ?coz he stole the car! Bili Piton! - Wait!... Hallo Bili. How many? Two! -New? As new... Clod, Bili? Mud. Eh, dammit... Well, what can I do? I dont like it either, but business is like that... Well, good, take it down... -Not this time! Excuse me? I said: Not this time Mr. Milutin. Why not? My money first! Ha! You're joking, really joking! I thought it was something serious... This IS very serious for me, Topalovic! In January you said: Money in April. A year has passed since then! Stop lying to me! If you don?t pay, the house goes! -What will happen with the house? I will burn it! Listen criminal: Mention the house once more and I?ll drink your blood! Just try Laki! You are wellcome! Easy Bili. Easy, wait! Wait... Laki is a bit nervous. Pantelija died, and this convulsed him... Calm down. Go, take a walk... Bili, please come in, so we can talk as men. I understand you, but you have to understand me too... I?m paying two diggers, crematory guards, informants... Everybody wants money and I just pay. Where from..? 20 years I?ve worked for you, diggin up coffins, you clean them, lack them and sell as new! True? True. In 20 years you have?nt made a new coffin, all this stuff is mine! True or not? -It?s true. I worked honestly... Risked being caught and put in jail... Now I want to be payed and this is finished. If you don?t have money to pay your debt, I have a proposition. Let?s hear it... My 40,000 shall be included in building the crematory. I reckon that is approximately one third. To be a partners? - Yes. To split the crematory profits? - Right! Out of the question... Then... All money by saturday. I swear, Milutin Topalovic, the house vanishes if you don?t pay. Do you understand me? I know what you want... To split us up, don?t you? To push this whore of yours into our home! Please, please. Solve the problems with your children somwhere else! You will regret this, Laki. I?ll kill you, sooner or later... I will castrate Mirko, if I see him once more with this witch! Oh, my God, with whom do I live... Djenka... I thought that you are smarter than your coffin makers... but you are even worse! I am totally disappointed in you. But I defended Kristina. I intended serious business with you, but you are pure idiots! It?s not worth working with you. Dont worry. I will compensate all damage, as soon Pantelija dies... Everything I inherit I?ll invest in the cinema. We will be partners. You know when he will die? - NEVER! He will live 200 years! You will never be your own host. Don?t touch this! Well, I WILL BE my own host! I decided to marry Kristina... and tomorrow I?ll ask her father for permission... So I thought... to ask you if you would be my best man...? I mean - If you want... Calm down. Calm down! Calm down or I?ll pour a whole jug of could water on your head! Hej, you, what are you doing?!? Well.. I?m hanging my photo... And why exactly? Well, I started this new business... Put back grandpa?s photo or I?ll test the oven with you! All right, I just... tried.. To see how it looks like...! Well, so.... Com?on, faster, faster, bridegroom! What - bridegroom? Which bridegroom? He asked for money this morning. He wants to get married. Well - did you give him? Yes, on the nose! Mug...YOU will marry?!? Com?on... Up... Uh, this is so heavy! - 90 kilos! If this blazes in 5 min., then the deceased will take 1 min.!... What are you doing, for gods sake? You are not finished yet? Soon, soon... I told you to rinse him quickly, not to wash him for 2 hours! Should I wash his hair? Just drop him in the water, wring him and straight to the crematory. Burning will start any minute! You will seriously burn it? 2 min. to get ready, and be in the crematory... My sincere condolences... - Come here... O, no. This is really too much for one photo... You will get more if you split up Mirko from this whore. Which whore? This Bilis whore. She will ruin my child. He is completly infatuated ! Not only is she older, from a family of criminals, she is even a WHORE! Can you imagine, this morning he asked seriously if he can marry her. Ah, is this true!? - I beat him like hell! And how do you think I can split them up? Don?t joke with me! You split up so many marriages.. why not this shitty relationship? I split up marriages?!? IF you split them up, you can ask us for what ever you want... Attention! It is exactly 12 o?clock. Mirko! As soon as Laki pulls the switch, you all founder... Look at me with a smile, until I say it?s enough. Ready? "My dearest, in this moment of fate for our familly.." "Wishing ourselves a lot of happiness and prosperity." Something is wrong! Power is low, or oven is defect! Out with this so we can see what is left. Olja, take out grandpa Maks. What is this? Mmm, smells good! And you wanted to bury my grandad in this SHIT?! We shall bury Pantelia as a christian man should be buried! And if anybody says anything more about this, I?ll smash his head! Hej, folks... This is not so bad! Bon apetit, bridegroom. Good... I will fix this tomorrow. Insulation burned up. Daddy says that you should take some meat sauce to his father. Yes, straight away... Grandpa likes grilled meat sauce best. You know.. This Pantelia is very tasty! You hit me now and never again! If you break the gate once more, you will have to do with me! Jesus, Mirko, what happened...? Nothing, dad beat me a bit -nothing really... A bit?!? How will you look when he beats you a lot? Is your father at home? Yes. I came to ask for your hand. For my hand? You didn?t ask me... Well, if your father approves, I?ll ask you too... Listen son, I?m telling you now: My daughter means all to me. Many asked for her, but I never gave her away. I said: You will marry the right one, or you wont marry at all! True? - True! - It?s true, daddy... You are a good fellow I see, but weak, hesitant, insignificant! Your family does what ever it want's with you... They take all, snatch it, annex it, and you are there as a last wretch! Yes, yes it?s true... You get the worst jobs, everybody beats you... You never have money, always have to beg from them.. You don?t know what is yours, man! This won?t go on, for God sake... Yes, yes, it will! IT WONT! Tomorrow, they're opening Pantelias testament... They will give me my share! So lad - Now you look like a real man! Kristina, in your room! If they trick me, I will kill them all, ALL! Wait, just easy and smart... I know them 50 years, they are big gangsters. Sit down. When is the burial? 5 o'clock, but I wont go... Don?t tallk rubbish! You must go. You can?t allow them to cut you out of the will. They're just waiting for this! When they open testament, and you know what is your share... then you can come to me, and we can make a deal. You know - they owe me a lot of money... With that money, and what you get from Pantelia... You can own the whole house. Understand? Now, if you are not so smart... Where is Mirko? Not with you? -With me? No. With that bitch again... Listen Djenka: Save our family no matter how... If needed, I will build you a cinema! Laki! - Coming!... If needed... - Laki! Where's the priest Djura? He didn?t want to come... - Why? He said that we are sinners. Read Laki. Nobody else will come, anyway. Yes, I will, dad. "Our dear father..." "The time has come at last, to say to you our final goodbye." "You died in your budding old age..." Laki... Laki, dont make trouble! Give me a gun! -I didn?t take it... Here!... I have to think of everything...! It?s nice Bili, that you came. I didn?t. I?m going to my wifes grave, I?m just passing by chance. Shove off! No one comes by chance to Pantelias burial! Wait, kids, stop! Some other time... After the burial I have something important to tell you... Where are you going? Did you come by chance as well to the funeral? No. I came to ask when you're opening testament tomorrow? And why do YOU care? I want my share, you wont trick me! Bastard! Your share, you want your share? Eh? - MONGRELS! Have you no respect even in this holy moment?!? Calm down at least until we bury grandpa! SILENCE! What is wrong with you Mirko? You are the same as your... Com?on, everything can be fixed in a nice way Laki, continue. "Ehm.. Our dear father, you know that our family always had..." "huge misfortune with women." "As soon as they give birth to sons, they wither and fade as flowers." "Because of that, nobody cries in mourning for you today." "Our dear father, you died at the very end of your life." "Because we today..." Daddy!... Daddy? Grandpa! He is alive. Dad, give me a hand! Daddy! Give me a hand! Com?on! Pull him up! There?s no point in him coming out of the grave at all! What did you say?!? -Give me the shovel, please... HIT THE BASTARD! Wait daddy... How is it, grandaddy? Drive faster! We can?t go faster, we're speeding at 30! Of course we can?t, your crazy son ruined the motor! And dont look back - you drive! Don?t mention him, please dad... How could I make him like this? For this insult I will omit him from the testament... He won?t get a single penny! Did you think, I would give him something?!? ATTENTION! What was that? You hit a man - that was that! I told you to look where you drive, clumsy ox! Which man? Where are you going dad? Listen to your father, animal! Out with you, I said... Come and look at the lamp, mug. See dad, this is Mr. Rajkovic! What's wrong with him?? NOW - It?s nothing! You killed him like a rabbit. Shall we hide him in the forest? Silence, mug. Take him... Pull him there... Move daddy. Take this corpse away from me! Death is a contagious disease..! Get on the front seat. -Yes, I will... Here with him... Com?on... Oh, you do make it difficult... Close the door and drive. If you really ... want to be best man, I agree... but under one condition... that he is YOUR best man. That you and me marry? Yes, surely, I didn?t have anything with him... Kristina, to be honest, I thought that you are a modern woman... that you are above such primitive things as marriage. I didn?t think... Now I see that I was wrong. I belived that we will understand each other the right way... I thought that we will one day have a big cinema... That we will travel around the world, make movies... That one day we will leave this.. desert! And yet, you are only ready to be the wife of small coffin maker. Kristina, Kristina... What you did yesterday, believe me, deeply disappointed me. You destroyed everything. Everything!... But if you have the courage to live an artists life with me.. Come. Everything is forgiven. Djenka... Djenka! DJENKA! Kristina, where are you going? LEAVE ME ALONE! Kristina! Djenka! Don?t be scared! Slow down a bit, we will fall over... Hold on! Just hold it... Hold on tight! Best men, don?t drive over the holes, I will fall off! You hold on too. We go to my place. I will show you something you have never seen... I will show you how to make a movie. Com?on Laki, take him out. Phuu, I would never remember this well. Don?t do that folks, Please! I beg of you...!! I have no strength left to clean the well... Excuse me, What do you mean? Ten more wells are around, but you just throw in mine! If.. If I don?t have a stroke now, I will never have one! Good kids, good... Excellent! Excellent! Bravo Mirko! That was that.... Now, you take her in your arms, kiss her and go towards camera... Shall I close my eyes when I kiss? -What? WHO should he kiss?!? Well - you. - No, he wont. Why now? Didn?t we agree? I told you Djenka, she will not want to kiss... You should be silent! Nobody asked YOU anything! Djenka..Can we do it without kisses? - NO, we can?t! When two people get married and come home, they KISS! Why don't you understand that you two ARE NOT YOU TWO...? you just play two others WHO KISS! Com?on don?t cause trouble! Here we go... Enough. It?s not really best... Enough! Enough! You are like a kid eating candys! You smirch me so...! -Now go we further kids: You run away from nuptials, stupid customs and even more stupid moral. You are alone and free for the first time. You try to forget everything that reminds you of the past. You take your clothes off. With disgust you repudiate your mask of courtesy... lie on the bed and smile. You are free for first time. Let?s do that... Are you mad? Who should be naked? I can take off clothes - to the trousers! Ah, who am I making this movie with... You are worse than the biggest false moralists in town! Now, please tell me, what is so wrong if two young and pretty... people take off their clothes? Didn?t most famous artists paint naked people?!? And who today thinks bad of those painters and their models? How can I name movie "Free life" if you dont want to lay NAKED in bed? It?s a shame to steal, to... to be a thief, to lie, to cheat... but it?s no shame to be naked! If this is prude, people would be born with clothes, not naked! The human body is biggest perfection in this world. Calm down, best man, we didn?t know that. You just said, we're making a modern movie. You two dont know anything! You just make stupid things and problems. You really behave as two cretins! Now I?m gonna show you how primitive and stupid you are. Turn off the lamp and sit here. Everything is YOUR fault! You see, this actress started like this, naked in a river... Without false shame or prudence. Now, she is a famous Hollywood star, eminent Hedy Lamarr. Richest actress in the world of movie art. She has two houses with pools, five handmade cars... And she doesn?t know what to do with all her gold and dollars. But she didn?t pretend to be shy. This she did - you see? For your own sakes, I beg you to undress and lay down for a bit... and you almost killed me! Yesterday I ran a sound movie and you started with yelling and howling. Djenka... No more "Sorry Djenka", you gambled my confidence in you. I?m... What?... I?m dying, you know, working and running for your sake... and in return you just dishonour me. You are primitive as if raised with bears. You want to be actors, but live as lowly peasants... I?m deeply disappointed! DEEPLY! Best man... - Decide once and for all what you want from life. If graves interest you, go now, I don?t want to see you again! I want nothing to do with gravediggers! You DESTROYED me! Finished? -Finished. Get out. Pull it up! Open it! Nothing? -Nothing. How empty when I know that he was buried here? Move! He had two brickworks, a few stores, folks say that he was buried in gold! Daddy! Daddy! Chief! What was it, pheasant? -Pheasant! Scared me, dam bird... Somebody else is digging too... That's why the coffin is empty Come on! Topalovic! Down! Something rustled... Something moved... Where? -There. Hear it? Nee, dig Laki. Not a living soul in this cemetry. Yes, yes... Grandpa...This is nothing. This is nothing. Dad!... Dad! GET OUT OF MY GRAVE! Straight away! Straight away! Daddy, wait for me... Daddy! Wait for me! "Straight away! Straight away!" Good evening... RUN! Why music? We don?t open testament every day. - Like this is more serious. I?ve never been so excited... - Read. "My dear..." "I?ll be short and clear, as I have always been.." "All I own, that is: house, grounds, workhouse, store and bonds..." "I leave to my dear great-great- great grand son, Laki". To me?!? He left all to me... Daddy, is this possibble? I know that he really loved me but...- READ ON! "I think that Laki is most proficient to continue the work I started"... Please, read further, I dont have any more strength... Forgery! Gangster! Forge grandpas testament! All I hear is you trying to embezzle the whole lot.. May the police catch you for that crash, MURDERER! Where did you find it? There, where passed grandpa left it, gangster! -Read dad! "My dear..." "This day has come when I have to say good bye to you, my dearest." "I?m writing this, my hand shaking with sorrow and pain." You groveller! You want to forge this mans testament?!? Well, you said that you dont know where testament is... Carry on dad. "I love you all the same, but as nature prompts and requests..." "I designate my son Maksimilian, and esteemed grandson Aksentije.." Let me see dad! You old trashbin! 100 years old but yet lie and diddle... and impunge me! I'm only jesting... Silence! We will discuss this disgrace later... And this is like a REAL testament? You doubt me? No daddy. "Thank god, one and half century I lived in heartiness and work..." "Knowing my time to die has come, I indite these words to pen.." "to my friend, counsellor Milic," "coz in you children, all together, I don?t have slightest confidence". "I am sorry that you are mine, and not children of my enemies." "Those who know you, won?t take even hell as so bad!" "About my wealthiness, which interested MOST..." "I can divulge you this:" "Everything I have, I leave to.." "MY SELF!" Pantelija. To whom did he leave? Himself. How can a dead man inherit him self? Even in death, he ridicules us! Bili will dig you up, I?m telling you. Grandpa, grandpa, you really are a hog! But how big is my share? SO BIG! If you are mad, you are not deaf. You heard what was written... This means that I didnt get anything, right?!? Eh, what a mug... Well, wont go like this! I want to know what belongs to me! Did this whore send you to rob us, huh? This belongs to you! WHAT?!? You?ll remember me! You will! Daddy's hooting. Go and see what he wants please... I don?t care what he wants! I served you enough! Mr. Bili told me nicely, that I won?t get anything from your family! I looked after him for 15 years, and he left nil to me! Despicable scumbag!! I?m comming daddy! I?m comming... daddy! Our condolences... Sit. If you please, these are ours models. Sorry you had to wait. Excuse me, who... - My brother. Older man, right? - 40 years. Uh,such a shame. What did he die of? Tuberculosis? He was murdered last night. Murdered? - Yes, somebody killed him and left him in the cemetry... Laki, you serve the gentleman... Daddy has to get his medicine! But grandpa! Grandpa! Excuse me, Is it known who did it? Personally, I would like to found out first. And what would you do? To adjudge him quickly? Oh no, no... NOT QUICKLY. I would adjudge him slowly... I would take him to the mountains, tie him to a tree, and... Cut after cut! - Calm down, please! I understand... - Slice after slice! I would hew him for a month! - Calm down!!! Stop! Stop! Here, all receipts, tidily signatured. How much money is there? Check yourself. - How much? 42,150 dinars. Without interest? Without. - All right... Dont worry grandpa, I dont forge. Mirko stole the car again! Fucking son of the thief! -We have now more important things to do! Laki, serve the guests. ME to serve? Serve! You, Laki, is this rat poison? Dad, please... Dont be scared Bili. Look... Grandpa Aksentije, did you maybe give rat poison to Rajkovic too? Who Rajkovic? Which Rajkovic? - What "Which Rajkovic?" Enough fooling around! Cough up now unless you want to go to jail for murder! Kristina! Kristina! Djenka! Djenka! Bravo girl, you look very good! Just swim... You look better than Hedy Lamarr! Good...Good.. Good... I can't any longer! Just swim... Good, splash a little with the legs. Yes, good, good... In rhythm with the music. Now, swim slowly towards the bank... I can?t... anymore... My beautiful one, we will do wonders! I knew you wont let me down. I came back because of you. - My swimming girl! Wait a moment, wait... Wait.. What are you doing, best men? We practice best man, testing for the movie. You will do this as well, but tomorrow. I?ll kill you... -Why best man? I?ll kill you! - Best men!... Why? Best men, best men... Dont... Dont be... Bitch!

Aj, we've been robbed! ROBBED! He took all the money we saved for Billi, look! Who dad? Who? Who? Who? This outcast of yours, who else would steal in my house?
