NARRATOR: "Not too many holidays are celebrated nation-wide in Russia... namely - any win for Russia soccer national team and New Year." "Since the latter happens much more often, it will be our main theme." "It just so happened - Russia stretches across the globe with 9 time zones, while the salad gets devoured in Vladivostok, it is only cut somewhere in Kaliningrad." "Our story begins here in Kaliningrad - most Westward city, city Santa comes to last." - Oreshkin, where the heck are you ? - Need a hand with that ? - Get lost! I need a hand over here. Fine. Murom Moskva Arkhangelsk Kaluga Ashgabat Yusuf, Ashgabat is not a Russian city My daughter lives there, growing up so fast. We are playing Cities, your city starts with "N" Novosibirsk Kineshma! What ??? You're a "Kineshma" ! My dad has been there How could he be there when you said he was in Ufa earlier. Not in Ufa, he was in Finland. Finland !? He was in Yakutsk! My stepdad sent me some chocolate covered pineapples. Why didn't you say something ? - Bring them here! - OK, one second. Look, look it's in the newspaper! Russian president visited cities on the Volga River. And payed special attention to the city of Kineshma. Let me see that. - Let me look - Go away! The president went to Sochi to meet with the mayor on December 27. And then it goes - Ufa, Yakutsk, Finland. The president then went to Finland on December 30. What can this mean ? She made it all up. She took everything from the newspaper. She looked at where the President went and told us that her dad was there. - And we all felt for it. - How could she have done that ? That is my father. Huh ?! I just could not talk about it. Fine, then have your daddy say something to you during his New Years speech Something like: "Hey, Varya!" He cannot say that on TV. Well... then have him say... "Santa helps those who help themselves!!!" Or else no one will ever talk to you. Nobody... ever! - Ok. He will say it. - Sure, we will see. NARRATOR: "Vova had no idea how to help poor Varya. It is impossible to change President's New Years speech." "And at the same time on the other coast, a man that could have helped Vova, was getting out the sauna in a sunny city of Yakutsk." Hey Boris, aren't you scared that your Olga - would leave you for someone else ? - why would she ? Well, she can't celebrate New Year with you. Go figure. NARRATOR: "It has been 6 months since Boris has been to Saint-Petersburg where his girlfriend lives." Hey, Olga ? Hey. You could not imagine what happened earlier today Yesterday the President visited Ufa, and our current timesheets immediately! Immediately! Jumped up by 15... 15 per cent. But that's not the main thing. The main thing is that now I... I will not return on April 20th. But will arrive on 4th of March. Olga, we've been through this a thousand times. I'm not doing it for me. It's all for us. Celebrate this one without me, and I will be back soon. - Everything will be what ? - Everything will be ve-ry good. I deposited money into your account, buy yourself something Something really nice. By the way, are you celebrating alone ? No. But don't worry, I have somebody to celebrate with. What do you mean ? Olga, I didn't get that. Olga, are you seeing someone ? I'm sorry Boris, I think the battery is about to die. Olga! Her battery is not dead. Olga OK Hey-hey, accountants! Hey! where are you going? What do want ? Want to come with us ? Hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it! - Hey... I need to go... - To the airport ? Yes. NARRATOR: "Boris was hoping that Olga still is waiting for and loves him." "But the taxi cab driver Pavel, from Krasnoyarsk... ..was pretty hopeless." See for yourself... We have all these snow-maidens. But not enough Santa's. I can give my gifts to a couple But I don't have gifts for the rest. I have my own snow-maiden. Hold on. That's Vera Brezhneva Give me a break I had the same thing when I was a kid I was in love with Mila Jovovic C'mon, are you serious ? Just how do you see her with you ? Driving down the road, right ? And she is standing on the side of the road ? Get me to club Nirvana, chief ? I'm late for my show. Tough case. Miracles never happen. Hey chief, club Nirvana - fast Can you do that ? Great! NARRATOR: "Seems like Pavel finally caught the Lady Luck for all his troubles." "Meanwhile in Yekaterinburg, Police captain Sinitsyn, Pavel's uncle apprehended someone else." "For something else." - Hey Ravill. I let the boys off to go get food. They will book him when they come back. All due respect Why do you put an innocent man Behind the bars on New Year's Eve ? New Year's Eve is just another day You robbed the jeweler on my beat on New Year's Eve. Say cap, they won't promote you for this anyway ? I'm not guilty, you know. You don't even have any evidence. - Sales clerk pointed right at you. - I was getting a gift for my friends. Your friends are eating dead meat in the ditch. So why didn't you buy it ? Uh ?! - What with ? - Then why did you go there ? Just checking price. So was the price right ? Let's go. The price was right. I would make enough and buy it later. I am looking for a job right now. - You don't believe me, do you ? - It's raining. Can you hear it ? No. You can't ? That's because it's not really raining. And you know why ? That's jail missing you and crying. Not funny. But it's true. Zaytsev. You are a thief, Your face says it all. And what is the right place for a thief ? I didn't take that necklace. Beautiful. NARRATOR: "Not only Zaytsev was caught that night. Yulia's fiance was caught at work by his enormous love for work." "While Yulia decided to buy his favorite champagne." - I'm sorry - Happy New Years OK, see you at 10. OK, bye. NARRATOR: "Dear girls, no need to despair if you meet a fake fiance. Because only a real man can change your life." - Varya, I know what we need to do. - So do I. I'm leaving. - No, for President to say it - But he won't! There is a theory of six handshakes. Each person knows another person through six people. Look. This is you. This is the President. You know someone. He knows someone else. He knows someone, and he knows someone. And eventually it will reach the President. Get it ? You don't believe me ? Fine. NARRATOR: "Vova started to look for the first handshake. There was no time to think and Vova decided to go with just luck. The first handshake was Misha. An orphan, who temporarily resides... ...in Cuba." Hey, Misha, are you there ? Did you think that I was a bear or something ? Not really, I thought you were so... stylish since you drive a Bentley. But you are just so funny. Yeah, I moved to Cuba later, all the glamour, expensive cars, business, parties in Saint-Tropez with celebrities, I am so sick of all of that! I want to get far away and have some privacy. Don't tell anyone I know Russian rappers. It's a shame to admit I know them. I know what you mean. I asked my parents to send me to Switzerland. It's so peaceful here. It was. Until I made it there! We don't have those over here. It would be great if you came to see me here. Seriously ? Oh, hey, excuse me, my phone is ringing. Sure Its work related. Give me a second. NARRATTOR: "Misha became the first link in the six handshake chain." You have to help me. It's very important! My friend has told everyone that her father is the President. And that he will say Hi to her during his New Years speech. In form of a message, But she really just does not have a father. That's why we need to ask the President to say the words. Ask the President ? - Yes the President - OK, he will say it, no problem. Hang up the phone, it's long distance. Bye. Hey, hold on. Write down the line. The line for President's speech ? OK. 'Santa helps those who help themselves' It's a deal. All right, bye. Thanks. Or else we will not do business with you. Get that to them. Yes. Down the chain links. We all believe in you. Good luck. Boom! Oreshkin, you're a fool. - What ? - It won't happen. The chain is started. I just called a very serious man. And what does that change ? Why don't you get it ? It's a system! It will make it to the President. To the President ? Yeah, my people in the government are having some issues, I need to help them out. Misha, let's make a deal. We will not lie to each other no matter what. OK OK, from not we only tell the truth. Nothing but the truth. Listen, I have to go, my students are here. - Promise me that you will call me. - I promise. NARRATOR: "Cuba turned out to be a dorm room in Kazan college." New Year is around the corner and we have a bungalow in the middle of the room. We don't live on the beach, what's up with that ? Because of you guys I had to make a promise, A promise I can't fulfill. Because of us !? Because of you we can't be in our own dorm. So your Swiss girl won't figure you out.

It happens. What happens ?! I did nothing wrong. I'm working like a clock. Making sure she has all she wants. Nice car, nice house, nice earrings... - Ferrari. - Yeah. And then her battery goes dead. - Attention... - What ? Attention is what they need. Or else... Hey darling? Listen, I'm running late you should go out with your girlfriends. And don't talk to me for the next 30 years while I'm working. - And then everything will be ve-ry good. - Oh c'mon. Oh. don't start with that. The only thing our girls need is for us to be there. If it's not you, it will be someone else. Hey, Lyuba! Hey dad! You know what ? - What, son ? - That Bavly is in a different time zone. It is 2 hours behind. We could celebrate here and then jet to Bavly, and celebrate it again there. That's great! Petya, help with the bags. Get a move on. Get the bags in. Petya, what are you doing here ? Look, Bavly is in a different time zone. They are 2 hours behind. So we could celebrate here, and then go to Bavly. - And do it again over there. - That's nice. Would you go get fruit punch? Sure.

You almost fell! I was only setting flowers in the vase! What vase ? Toma, you've lost your mind. It's heavy and dangerous, let me handle it. Toma, you are so lucky, He is so affectionate that he carries you around. Gets the vase and even fills it. Oh, the public signs of affection... Yulia, make a New Year's wish and, Someone will carry you around. Petya, leave the flowers here. Yes, right there. Last New Year's Eve I made a wish, For Petya to quit drinking. And he did. Here is what you need to do. The President is about to finish his speech, The clock tower starts striking, At the first clock strike, you write down you wish, Burn it and drop the ashes into your champagne glass. Then you take the last sip at the last clock strike, He isn't going to start drinking. If you do it right your wish will come true. Petya has Venus stock in fifth planet Look, Yulia I made your personal horoscope. It doesn't look bad at all. Your wheel of fortune is going to planet seven. And once it gets there, You will get a husband, kids, and a family. Full harmony. - Yes, that's nice. - I think it's nonsense. I'm not really superstitious. In 8 years all planets will line up just right. - How old are you now ? - 35 So you will be 43. 43 ? You must fight your destiny. I agree. When planets line up, then fight. Hey girl. Oh, c'mon.

So she doesn't live a lie, 8 years, 8 years, she isn't serving them in jail! - It's astrology... - What's astrology? - The science is 10 thousand years old... - Quit making these things up.
