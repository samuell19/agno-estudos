Winter here in Norrland feels like a whole eternity. Especially when you're longing for someone. I think of Daniel every day. And of all that happened last summer. When he and his mother were here. Hi. There's mail for you, Emma. There's a letter for you. From Stockholm again. Aren't you going to open it? - I'll do it later. Look at this! - Ok, but what about the candles? - Candles would be a little too much. - Of course we should have candles. 42 of them. - We don't have any candles. - You were supposed to buy some. - I didn't say that. - You didn't forget your snuff. Hello guys. - Hi. - Hi, Isak. Have a seat. - How nice it is here. - You think so? - Yep. - Here's your medicine. -Thank you. That'll keep me going for a while. - We would have had candles on the cake, except Dad forgot. - It looks nice anyway. - It's been a long time since we were in Ovansjö. mm, thank you. - Maybe I could have a piece too? Good cake, Emma. - Actually I made it. - Congratulations! Emma, would you hold this? - When are we leaving? - As soon as the weather gets better. Thanks. Take care. - Bye, Isak. Shouldn't you read that letter soon? Well? Who was it from? - You remember Daniel? I told you about him. Same age as you ... And his mum ... - Yes, what about them? - They're coming here. - What for? - For a visit. - You don't know them. - We have exchanged letters. - How did you meet them? - Does it matter? - Yes, it does. - Through an ad. - An ad?! Are you crazy? It's Mum's birthday! - Mum doesn't want us to be alone. - Yes she does! - Emma, wait! - Just leave me alone! It didn't matter if we were in a hurry. Every time we went past the place where Mum crashed, Dad had to stop. Every week I changed the flowers. No one but me and my dog are allowed to be there. It's as if mother's spirit is hovering over this place. I get worried that she's going to disappear if someone else comes and interferes. Are you coming? - You go on, I'll wait here. - But, Emma ... - No, I said. - Okay, do as you like then! I didn't want to meet those ad contact people. Some new woman shouldn't take my mother's place. The fact that she had children made it even worse. I can't find them. They aren't here. Hello. Sorry. Are you Anders? -Yes, hey. Sara? Fuck! I was looking for... - This is Daniel. - Hi, Daniel. Anders. Shall I take the bag? - Thanks. - Emma, this is Sara, Daniel ... - Hello Emma. - Hello. - Right ... I decided to be as unpleasant as possible. Then maybe they would go home. The sooner the better. - I've never been to Norrland. - Haven't you? - Well yes, Gävle. - Gävle, right. - Once. How beautiful it is. - Yes ... likewise .... No... I mean ... Well, thank you. Isn't it beautiful, Daniel. -What? What's that? - A computer, can't you see? - What do you want that for? - What do you usually want a computer for? - It needs electric power, doesn't it? - You think? - We have no power. - What? - No, we have no power. Electricity, you know? Did you know that? - What? - They have no power. - Don't they? Oh that's very cool. How exciting! The most meaningless week of my whole life ... Are we there? - Not quite. Hello to you. - Hello. Will we be able to go out tomorrow? Please ... - If the weather improves. Good morning. My name is Isak. - Hello. Sara. - Isak and I work together. - So you're going to be the new wife? - Maybe ... I don't think so. - No? - This is Daniel. -Hello. The weather should be better tomorrow. We can go to Ovansjö. - Daniel might want to come along. - Would you like that? Emma and I are going fishing. - Where? - Further up towards the mountain. Come with us. That sounds fun, doesn't it? - Yeah, sure. OK, decided. We're going tomorrow Emma. we're leaving now. Isak is the only one I know who has shot a bear. - Are there bears here? - Wolves, too, for that matter. They eat Stockholmers for breakfast. - Emma! Too fast for you? - No. - Mum ... - Not the first time I've driven this. It got worse and worse. Dad was completely weird. Trying to impress all the time. And that Sara was just as bad. Daniel seemed to think the same, but that was no consolation. Tourists stay there. Mostly Germans and Norwegians. Isak and I take them out and make sure they catch some fish. Isn't it lovely? There we have the kiosk. A few supplies, tobacco, coffee ... And there we have the sauna. I'll fire it up later. Yes, so this is how we live. Welcome. - Cosy. Nice. You can see the lake in every direction. Do you think our mosquitoes are afraid of that? What's special about your mosquitoes? I have a good ointment that'll help. Let me show you where you're going to stay. You can sleep here. We had a double booking in the cabins. Is it okay for you to sleep at my place? I ... well I won't be sleeping here. I'll be in the attic. - Yes, yes, of course. - Sure it's okay? - Absolutely. Daniel, you're sleeping in here. This is Emma's room. Okay with that? - Yes, of course. So, you just need make yourself at home. I'll ... I'll have dinner for you later. How could you give away my room? - There are no cabins. -Where are they going to sleep, then? -Yes, but that's my room! -Give me my pillow. -Sorry!! And take off your shoes. So you only eat fish? - There has to be a lot of fish ... and pancakes. - Don't you long for something different? - Like what? - Something more exotic? - I'll offer you smoked reindeer sometime. - What nice fillets! Look, Daniel. -Thanks. I only eat fish that's square and guaranteed free from bones. - wow, fascinating. You could help Emma lay the table, Daniel. -What happened? -I don't know. It's supposed to be here somewhere. - No, over there. - According to the map, it should be here. - You're wrong, it's over there. - No. Hi! - Hi. There should be a fishing camp here. - Yes, up there. - Do you know if they have T-spirit up there? - No idea. Where are you from? - All the way from Ovansjö. - Is there electricity in Ovansjö? -There's a power line close. Bye for now. Well, we'll try ... Pitch oil should be put here, on the ears. That's the only way. Almond potatoes. You smell strange. - It's pitch oil. - For the mosquitoes. But you shouldn't put it directly on the skin. When are we going to that place? - Oh, so you want to come along. Good. - Sure you want to? - Mmm ... - When are you going there? - Tomorrow morning. You'll see a mountain cabin. - That's nothing to see. Just an ugly old house. - Sounds like fun. - So how long will you stay there? - Two days. Can you fish? - No. - Could you show him, Emma? - What for? Odin! Isak is sure to show you. - I don't like fishing. - What do you like then? - Things you need electricity for. Good! Delicious! Try it. Do you think I want you to come along? - No. - So why are you doing it, then? - Because I want to. - You might as well stay here. After all, you're not fishing. - I want to see a real mountain cabin. - Isak and I are mates! - Mate with a 100 year old? - Better him than you! I didn't want to come here okay? Your Dad put in an ad like he wanted to buy a dog. - I didn't ask to meet you. - Same here! Do you think I lie awake at night dreaming of someone like you? I don't give a damn what you do at night. Do you know what you are? You're a fucking bastard! What's going on? - Yeah, she's having a little trouble right now. I hope it'll pass. Go fuck yourself, you ugly killer fairy ... The dolls Mum made ... I was obsessed and couldn't sleep without them. So very hard. Especially for Dad. I thought you stopped doing that. - Stopped what? - Are you going to be here all alone? - Definitely. - Are you sad in any way? - I don't want to talk right now, Dad. Are you looking forward to going out with Isak? - I don't want to talk right now. - Okay. - Good night, sweetheart. -Good night. Try to be a little nicer to her at the moment. - Yes, yes, I will. Try to be nice to Daniel now. - Yeah Yeah. Hello Hello! - Hi! Let's get on our way. At least the weather got better.. Kent's gonna take them out a little way. - Hi. You have mobiles with you, yeah? - What? There's no coverage up there. - Don't worry. We'll see you in a few days. Put on your life jackets. - Be careful now. Bye! If we run out of petrol ... - Well, then they'll have to keep going for a while. It felt better with Isak there. We understood each other without having to talk. Daniel was as obsessed with computers as I was with my dolls. I wondered why, though I had no intention of asking. That's it, just jump ashore. Good. - Hey Kent. Thank you. What are we going to do now? - We can't go on the river. -You'll see that. -If you go farther it becomes dangerous. I have a boat above the rapids that we can use up there. Aren't there any reindeer here? They're up in the mountains, don't you understand? They are on summer pastures. Look, there are people there. With rifles and everything. Give it to me! No, I don't see anyone. - It's true. Look again! - Can I see? Maybe one of my tourists. No, probably not one of my tourists. Maybe a bird watcher? If only there isn't any poaching going on. We have both kestrel and golden eagle here, and we would like to keep them here. Come on, let's go. Oh, help! - Hey, watch out! - Thanks. - It's a bit slippery. Are we there now? - No, just a little boat ride to go. Let's push out the boat. There. Sit down in the boat! Hold the boat. That's it. I'll just tie it up. Welcome. - Thanks. Great. Where am I sleeping? - You can sleep here on the couch. I'm sleeping upstairs. No, there's a risk of everything crashing down. The floor is rotten. Nice accordion. Can you play? -Yes, this ... is my little old lady! Are you in this? - Yes, I am. That's me there with my brothers and sisters. and mother and father. -Are they still alive? -No. They've been gone a long time. Where's the switch? - The switch? - Yes, how do you turn on the light? -Here we get light mostly from the stove. - Yes, but isn't there power? - You mean electricity? The power line's somewhere near here, isn't it? - The power line came in 1960, but by then no one lived here any more. - But surely there's electricity? - Electricity never came to Ovansjö. It just didn't. happen. It disappeared south. I don't know what they'd need it for down there. It didn't stay in Ovansjö. - What am I doing here? - What did you say? - Nothing. Daniel was disappointed when he realized there was no electricity up there. But I thought he only had himself to blame. Look, there's a reindeer over there! Listen to me. Come here, come and look! -Check the reindeer, it's all white. -Let me see. The white one, yes ... I was 12, and had gone over the mountain. The snow started to fall. I couldn't see my hand in front of my face. Then she was there, the white one. She walked in front of me, all the way home. - Surely it can't not the same white one as when you were twelve? Can't it? That's not possible. How old can a reindeer get? A lot of things aren't possible but still happen. You'd better show him, Emma. We don't offer this kind of fishing to everyone. This is what you do. First pull it down. Hold it in, draw it back, then cast forward. Got it? - Umm, yes ... I'd like to give you something. - But ... this knife ... is it for me? - You like fishing. So you need a good knife. You can't buy one like this in the shops. It's special. You'll feel the difference.. Thank you! I've got one! I've got one! Look! - Just bring it in slowly. So what do I do now? - I suppose you have to kill it. - What? It isn't an aquarium fish. We should eat it. - Yeah, but ... just look how small it is. - They usually are. - Oh, how cute. Look, look! - You have a good knife to lend now. So should I .. like ... Should I just let it ... C'mon Emma, say something. Oh hell. Hang on ... Here you are. - Thanks. I'm really hungry. Here, you have this. - What kind of fish is it? - Trout, of course. - It's real fish, that. - But it's not square. - Of course it's not square. Who would want that? - Him! He likes square fish. - Why? - Because they have no bones. - Ah, so that's why ... Pretty good, actually. In the evening we had a great time, but something was wrong with Isak. As if he was lost in his own thoughts. - "I only eat square ..." - Oh lay off! Aha, so you're staying indoors. - Yes. I'm tired. I'm going to bed. Can you be nice and clear the table. - Yes. Good night, good night. - Good night. Do you want to sleep on the inside or the outside? - Outside. Well, what do we do now? Sleep, I suppose. Good night. Good night. "I only eat square." - Stop it! - "I only eat square." - Tomorrow, you should have to eat one raw. Oh, no! -Where's your Dad by the way? - In the United States, why? No, I was just wondering. Good night. He's in Silicon Valley. -Yeah. Head of a computer company there. 4000 employees. - Yeah, should I be impressed or what? - "Should I be impressed or what?" Goodnight. - Goodnight. So much smoke! What have you done? -I've got a fire going. - So I see. It's easier if you open the throttle. - Yeah yeah yeah yeah ... Is Isak awake? -I don't know, haven't seen him. - He usually wakes up really early. How much coffee should I make? - A lot. Isak likes strong coffee. Isak! Hello! Isak, are you asleep? Hello! What's up? - I don't know. - Would you check? - Yeah, sure. Isak! Hello! Wake up, Isak! Hello! He's alive, there's a pulse, but it's like he's unconscious. God, what are we going to do now? - Get some water! Get some water, I said! Get some water, I said! Don't you understand what I'm saying? We panicked. The whole world spun around. - Isak! Hello! - I hardly remember anything after that. Wake up! Wait! Where are you going? Stop it! Wait! Where the hell are you going? Where are you going? What the hell are you doing? - Move. - But where are we going? - Sit down in the boat. Isak is going to die, don't you get it? What happened there? - It won't steer. - What's wrong? - I don't know. - We're heading straight for the rapids. - Take this. The oars! - No! Lie down. Lie down! Down! Down! Fucking idiot! You could have killed us! - It wasn't my fault. We have to save Isak. - By dying ourselves? You're crazy! - Stop it! What do we do now? - I don't know. - The shear pin's broken. - Yeah. - Do you think Isak has a spare? - How would I know? - Maybe in the backpack. - Come on, let's go back. - But what if he ... - Come on now, we need to hurry. Come on!. - What the hell ... it's completely empty. What is it? - I don't want to go in. - Come on, we have to. He may have woken up. Come on. - Let me go, I can go myself. No, don't say anything. I don't want to hear it. I think he's ... He's not alive. He's dead. We have to change. - Isak is dead, don't you understand? - I know, but we still have to change. He must have woken up after we left. He was in a different position. Maybe it wasn't so smart to just take off. - So it's my fault he died? - I didn't say that. - Yes, everything is my fault, mine, mine, mine! - Shut up!! We couldn't have done anything. - Yes, we could. - He might have had a brain haemorrhage. Now we have to find a shear pin, too. - You can do it. I'm not going in there. - I thought you were a wilderness girl. Used to everything afraid of nothing. But I can't, don't you understand? I can't find it. - Check the pockets. Is that what we're looking for? Well, why have you got those with you? - Because. - Whatever. Come on, we're leaving. I don't get it. He took his medicine. - But he was old. - Huh, that was my fault. You have to focus. Didn't you tie it up? - What? - Idiot! - Me? I'm the idiot? It's running water. You should have secured it. - It was you untied it. You took us through the rapids. And you broke the pin. - Yeah, just blame me. Where are the life jackets by the way? Didn't we drop them around here? Look! - No, I'm leaving. How far is home? - About 15 kilometres But we have to cross over. We should get our stuff first. - I'm not going back there! - I can't leave my computer in the house. I got it from my Dad. - That's all you're you're thinking about? No one gonna nick it. Let's go. Someone lit a fire up there. Do you actually know where you're going? Catch. - Hang on, what d'you think you're doing? - We have to get to the other side. - It's too deep. - You a coward, or what? - What are you doing? Seriously! Don't you understand it's dangerous? Shit Get rid of the doll, Emma. This can't be happening. I lost a boot. - Yes, I noticed. Now we're going back. - No. - Yes! Now we do what I say. Hello! Is there anyone here? Anyone home? Come on, then! - I can't! Give it to me! Give it to me! - Let go! Leave it! Come on then. Huh? Take your little doll. Come on, then! Come on. Take it, then. Come on! I'll burn it if you don't come. You wouldn't dare! - Oh yes, I won't hesitate. Come on! Huh? Take the little doll! Maybe I can use Isak's boots, then you can have mine. - Okay, but I'm not going in there. - No, I know. My computer was in there. - Yeah. When it stops raining, we're off. It'll have to be tomorrow. It's too late now. - There's no more fire wood. -Yeah. And...? We need more wood. - Yeah yeah. Everything is soaked. Well. Now what do we use to make a fire? There may be something in the room next to Isak, but ... -Yeah, come on! -I don't want to. Come on! You can close your eyes or something. Come on! Look! It must have been Isak. - Yeah. It's natural to die when you're old. - No it's not. - I once had an uncle who died ... at least ... well, he ... he died. - Why? - He got sick and then he died. That's how it works. - No, it doesn't! What's up? What are you doing? I can't bear to think about death. It's all I do. - Why? - Why and why. Well at least we have something to light a fire with tonight. -But I don't want to stay here. -I know. Come on, it'll be all right. - Nothing will be all right ever again. Ugh, sod off! Didn't they have any bigger ones? - Who are they? - The people at the fish shop. - No. God it was good to have some food.. - Yeah. Um, what's it called ... your Mum ... Are they divorced? No, she ... She's dead. What ...? How ...? At least ..., I mean ... what happened? I don't want to talk about it. Okay. Elephants usually do that. - Do what? - Return to where they were born. When they feel they are dying. My Mum knew Isak from when she was little. - Yes I understand. - No, I don't think you do. You've got no brothers or sisters, have you. No. Okay, I'm ready. - The mouse, too? - It was here when we arrived. You coming? - Yeah, I'm coming. Bye, Isak. Hope we meet again. I didn't care how we got there. I felt quite calm. Daniel, where are you? Daniel, answer me! Emma! - Daniel ... Emma !! Where are you? I can't see you. - Emma! Oh shit. - Emma, I'm down in the ravine! Be careful! Oh my God! What have you done? - I fell. - Can't you get up? - No, I think my foot is broken. Wait!! What are you doing? - Almost done. I don't want to die down here. Catch. - No, I can't reach. Now? - Yeah. How are you doing now? - Okay. Fine. Come on, not far now. - I'm trying. Ow, looks like you've sprained it. Is it long since she died? - Who? - Your Mum. - Why are you thinking about that now? - When I was down there, I thought ... - It was two years ago. I was in the back seat of the car. It was my fault. Isak was the only one who knew how it happened. - But you were only ten. - Yes, but I distracted her. - How? - With my dolls. It was my fault. - That's impossible. It was an accident. Just like me ending up down there. Don't go away again. - I promise. Thank God. Now I know where we are. Well, that's good. So who lives there? - No one. The Sami people usually use it. It's locked. No, that's not gonna work. Can I borrow the knife? Where did you learn that? - Just something I know, OK? Can you get me the stool? Thanks. How's your foot? - Ow! They should have missed us by now. We were supposed to be home today. - My Dad isn't the worrying kind. - Then you don't know my mother. She worries about everything, especially after Dad went to the United States. - How often do you see him? - I was there last summer. -Oh. That really is a long time. He should have come home in the autumn, but then he got a new contract. If only we could send an email. - My Dad doesn't have a computer anyway. If you could wish for one thing before you died, what would it be? - Stop it. - Tell me - Nothing that's possible anyway. I'd like to see my mother just once more. Listen, there's one thing I haven't told you. - What? You know when we came back the second time? after Isak had died? Someone must have been in there. - What do you mean? - I remember pulling the blanket over Isak's face. When we came back, the blanket had been pulled down, and my computer was in there. - But... - Honestly. - But wasn't he dead? - Absolutely stone dead. - Who could it have been? - No idea. Why didn't you say anything? - You were so upset. And the life jackets? Maybe it was the same person. - It's possible. And if that's the case, that person must have gone for help. Obviously, that's what you do if you find a dead body. - Then maybe mountain rescue will come. But why would they come here? We have to be visible somehow. - What are you going to do? - You'll see. Come on. Hey, look! Now this is burning, too. - Yhat's great! Do you think they'll find us now? - Hope so! At least I tried. But ... what if ... - What? My stomach hurts. - It's probably hunger. Let's get some sleep. Imagine a large grilled chicken with lots of French fries. Or Dad's pancakes. Emma. Emma, wake up! Emma, there's a fire. Come on, we have to get out. -My computer's burning in there. - And my dolls. Emma, where are you going? What're you doing? Come on, Emma. Come on, we have to get out of here! You're crazy. You could have burned to death for those damn dolls. What are you doing now? They're horrible. Look! Wait! Here! Over here! Stop! Come back! Isak Töyrö seems to have died of natural causes. We'll know after the autopsy tomorrow morning, at the earliest. The children probably tried to get home on their own. - But the boat you found ... - We know nothing about that. We can't draw any conclusions in any direction. Excuse me ... No! My eggs! Excuse me. I prefer to talk to this man myself . A reindeer shepherd cabin near Vuogga has burned down. We need backup. You didn't see the kids around there, did you? - No one was found there as far as we know. We're putting all our resources into finding the children. Try to be calm. - But the boat you found, was it Isak's? - It may have been someone else's. -Try to stay calm. Don't keep telling me to be calm!! We'll be home soon, right? - Ouch ouch! Maniac! - Oh sorry. But I can carry you home. - Oh sure. How? - I don't know. But we'll always find a way. - Grilled chicken with French fries. - Yes... I should call Daniel's Dad. - It'd be silly to make him worry unnecessarily. - What? They've disappeared! -I can't make it. -Yes you can! What is it, Odin? God, it's Odin. Come on! -Hello! Hello! -Hello! Can you see us? Hello. Hello! - Hello! Daniel! Stay there! We're coming! We did it. Here comes Odin. Can't you go a little faster? - Hi, Odin. Come on! Oh, it's wonderful to see you! Sweetheart! What's the matter? Have you hurt yourself? God, I've been so worried about you! Are you all right? - Fine, but Isak's dead. - I heard that. Can't you stand on your leg? No, honey. Oh... -So how are you doing? - Odin, come on! What? Have you hurt your leg? What is it, do you think? - Nothing broken, but it's a bad sprain. Such things you have to endure if you go out on the mountain. - Shouldn't it be bandaged? - Bandages, that's for weaklings. I've heated the sauna for you. Bye then. - No, Odin! But ... - No, no, that's disgusting! You have resin in your hair. - OK, so get rid of it. - Is it gone? - Yes, it's gone. Come on. Odin, sit down. Quiet! What sort should we get? - Mum likes all kinds of flowers. Okay. You don't think it was your fault any more? No. Maybe not. Do you ... do you think they ... ... you know ... -No, it doesn't look like it. No. Come on, so you don't miss your plane. Shame it turned out like this, but ... we might get to see you again. - We'll see about that. You can write. - Yes. Have a nice time. - Same to you. - Give my regards to Stockholm, then. - Yes, I'll do that. Bye. - Bye. - Have a good trip. Are you going to see her again? - Sara? - Yes, who did you think? - Well, I don't know. We shall see. She was very nice, but these things aren't easy. "these things"? Yes, these things about ... love and stuff. There's a lot that has to fit. She's probably used to a different life. And then all that with Isak ... - But I think you fit pretty well together. Actually. Now a year has passed. Dad may be right, life must go on. Though I wish it could be like Isak said: "A lot of things aren't possible but still happen." It didn't get that big, but it doesn't matter, does it? - No, it's only the two of us this year. - Put one of those ads in again. "Single bearded Dad looking for a like-minded woman for wilderness life." - Hmm, maybe. The mail. I'll get it. Hey, there's mail for you, Emma. How's it going? - It's going okay. But what are you doing here? - Just passing. - Shouldn't you be in the USA? - Dad's coming later in the summer. - Okay, come on in. How long have you been planning this? - Your Dad wrote wondering what I was doing this summer. Was that stupid, do you think? - No, it's great. - Shall we try fly fishing? I've got my own flies with me. - Are those Stockholm flies? - Of course they are. Hello, old boy. English subtitles by jeremys and faxeholm1234
