Welcome to "Sports Now," live coverage of pro draft 2018. With less than a minute left on the clock, all eyes are on Miami for their picks. Who are you guys looking to on this pick? Oh, I'm going Rich Porter all day long. I mean, in this draft, he's the guy. He's the man. He's got all the tools, guys. Listen, he's got the athletic ability. He's got the mobility. He's got ambidextrous arm strength, guys. There's no other choice right here. What about these reports of his throwing temper tantrums or having emotional outbursts? His maturity is going to be the biggest challenge to his career at this point, but I think he's up for it, right? He's been through a lot in his life, and I think that, once again, he'll have to prove his way through this situation. But with the right coaching, with the right team surrounding him, I think he can grow into this league as a player and as a person. All right. Here it is. Let's go to the podium for the official selection of this year's draft picks. For our first-round pick, Miami selects... Rich Porter, quarterback, West Colorado. But the real question now is, where is Rich Porter? Rich Porter. This is Coach Hardwick with Miami. A time like this, I thought you'd be glued by your phone. Anyway, I hope you love good weather and beautiful women because you are playing for me now, so call me back. Hello, Mr. Porter. This is Andy from the Cebu Rescue Unit. I am calling because we may have finally found the remains of your mother. We need a family member to come down and I.D. the body to confirm. I understand this must be difficult for you, but you would only need to come up for one day. Please call us to schedule soon. Thank you, Mr. Porter. Rich, it's your agent again. Listen, I know you're dealing with a lot, and I'm sure you have a good reason for disappearing. I'll work on buying us some time here Stateside. In the meantime, I hope you find what you're looking for... wherever you are. It's not her. Are you sure? Yeah, I'm positive. I'm sorry, Mr. Porter. I know you came a long way. I'm not leaving until I find her. I know you understand. It just helps me cope to help others. Mom. I want you to have this. It's our birthstone. Porter! What the hell do you think this is, huh? You fall asleep in my meetings again, I'm gonna have Jeremiah start over you. You understand me? Yo! Go, Miah! All right. Today is Media Day, gentlemen, which means I want everyone on their best behavior. We have some very special visitors coming from the hospital today, and I want all of us to make them feel welcome, especially in front of the press. Coach. Media? Who's coming? Sorry, Barnum. No one big enough to recruit. Just an ordinary day. All right. Listen up. Now is the time that we show the world that we are the toughest men on this planet. No pads, no helmets, - but raw aggression. - Mm! - Whoo! - Yeah. Fear nothing. Regret nothing. - Regret nothing! - Achieve everything! Achieve everything! We are the Cebu Saints! Whoo. Look sharp, Barnum. Media's here. So, that's about it -- conditioning, conditioning, conditioning. See, last year, we gave up too easily. I admit we burned out too quickly. We got tired. Don't expect to see that this season. God! Catch the ball! - That's how you catch the ball. - I'm trying. I'm sorry. No, I don't want to hear that. I threw this right to your number. Now catch the damn ball. - Wake up! - Any other questions? I guess the change of scenery didn't help much, did it? Ray McQuinn. What business do you have here in Cebu? Well, you know, Rich Porter's still a big name in the U.S. Folks wanna know what happened to Miami's top pick. You know what happened. Well, Miami's pissed. His agent's pissed. Commish is pissed. I'm just here to ask a few questions, nothing more. No. You're not cashing in on Rich again. I'm just trying to write a piece on why he's here and not playing ball. He is playing ball. And you know why he's here. And playing here would solve things. Is that it? Both of you throw away professional careers to come out here and play with this ragtag team of... Christ, I don't even know what you call it. It's a bit odd. Wouldn't you say? That will be all for today, everyone. Thank you for coming. I came to write a positive piece. Really? You're the one that stabbed him in the back. And for what? For what? A headline and some cash? You nearly ruined his life. You make me sick. So, is that no on-the-record comment, Coach? Yep, and you can quote me on that. I'll be in touch. Mr. Porter. Would you mind taking a photo? He's a very big fan of yours. Sure. What's your name, kid? All right. You're welcome. Heads up. Ray's here. - Hey, jackass. - What?! You want to know why Ray's here? No, I don't, 'cause I don't care. Well, you should. - What is your problem?! - You are! Big-time reporters are here, and you're acting like you don't care at all. You have any idea what this could mean for us? Huh?! Be the captain of this team, not the tumor. You think I'm afraid of you? God help you if you ruin my chances of getting picked up. How you doing, Rich? Go home, Ray. Listen, buddy, I understand why you're pissed. - I do. - I said, "Go home." I'm just trying to make things right here. You know what? You come around here one more time, and you're done. Everything okay? - Yeah. Good. - You sure? Yeah. Yeah. Okay? Ready? Be careful. Rich. You're my hero. I'm sorry, Mom. It should have been me. No, honey. No. Shh. - Mom, I'm so sorry. - Stop. Babe. Babe! What's wrong? It's a migraine. I'm stressed. I know what you need to feel better. Where are you gonna go now? I gotta go see a guy about my mom. Oh. Do you want me to come with you? - No. It's okay. - All right. I guess we'll celebrate later, then? Celebrate what? Our one-month anniversary. Remember? Anniversary. Right. Um... What? N-- I just -- I didn't realize that... - That we were a thing? - No, no, no. I didn't realize that that day is today. - Oh. Okay. - Yeah. I guess we'll hang out later, then? Yeah. I'll give you a call. - Okay. - All right. - Hello. - Hi. Henry? Rich Porter. Sorry I'm late. Yes, Mr. Porter. Please, sit down. So, are you a friend of Manny's? No. Actually, an officer at the station recommended you. I'm usually the last resort. Mm. Well, they said that you were the best on the island. How can I help? My mother, Karen. She's one of the missing persons of the typhoon. I'm sorry to hear that. When did you last hear from her? I last contacted her a week before the disaster. What was she doing here? Helping orphanages, feeding the poor, that type of stuff. Are you a believer? No. Do you think your mother's still alive? I'm just looking for closure. No, I don't think she's still alive. Well... if she was in Cebu during the disaster and you haven't heard from her by now, her body was probably found and buried by one of the churches. How much is your retainer fee? I wish I could help you. If this is about money, I don't care. I'll pay. These are just some of the missing persons I'm already looking for. I'm sorry, but I can't take any new cases at this time. This is for you. It's a list of all the organizations in the area, including those that aren't online. Free of charge. I saw you looking at that picture when you came in. I figure you know who that is. Samson? One of the great judges. A warrior of God who fought entire armies and won great battles alone. Yeah, but Samson wasn't always strong. It was just his hair. It was his fear of being alone that made him weak. He lost his strength from a woman that he thought he loved. But his strength eventually returned... when he truly relied on God and called out to him. His strength was his faith. It had nothing to do with his hair. When you need to call on God for strength... ...I hope you see that he's closer than you think he is. I'd like to know where he is right now. Ask him. He hears, and he will answer you. He loves us like that. After all, he is a god of second chances. Thanks. There's a number on that, so if you find any new leads, don't hesitate to call. Rich. Godspeed. I didn't know you played the piano. Were you any good? What are you doing here? I told you I was coming over. I thought I told you to wait until I called. I know, but I made you something. A couple of the shells fell off, but... Just so that you feel more at home. Thank you. I appreciate this. Is everything okay? That guy in the parking lot -- Who was he? Just one of my old friends. What happened? He just wrote some stuff about me that he shouldn't have. Is that why you're always sad? What? Why do you care? Do you want some wine? Are you selling me out to Ray? Huh? - I'm leaving. - You're what? I can't stay in Cebu like this anymore. You're giving me nothing, and they're willing to pay me big for some information on you. So you were just using me? I used you? You don't even know when our anniversary is. The only time you ever call me is when it's late at night, and you're wasted. You know, I thought that you were gonna take me places and that you really loved me, but no. You're not going anywhere. I am going somewhere! You're a pathetic loser who's not good enough to go pro, and finding Mommy isn't gonna help you. You wanna piss me off! Don't you?! What, are you gonna kill me, too? What? You know what I'm talking about -- your brother. Get out! Get out! You're the one that stabbed him in the back. And for what? For what? A headline and some cash? You come around here one more time, and you're done. Hello? Ray, I need your help. It's Rich. He's lost his mind. Thank you. Okay. Thank you so much. Good. Barnum, swim past him once you get him in position. Where the hell's Porter? Morning, Coach. Media Day was yesterday. For Rich's sake, a little cooperation would be appreciated, sir. Move! Move! Crap. Look, I'm sorry. My alarm didn't go off. What? - I ne-- She set me up! - Why? She's trying to fish money out of Ray. What happened to your hand? - You were drinking, weren't you? - No. Try again. I can smell it on you. I didn't drink until after we fought. Okay. Let me get this straight. You got into an argument. You broke up. You hit the wall. She hit her own face to frame you. And then you got drunk? Hmm. Little trick I learned. I didn't see her hit herself. She must have done it after. If she hasn't pressed charges by now, that means she's probably scheming something. You believe me, right? Yeah. Of course I do. You can be an idiot... ...but you're not a monster. I got you a cell. Doesn't mean I'm gonna use it. That's fine, 'cause I'm only gonna call you when it's an emergency like this one, and you better answer. - Yeah, we'll see. - Hey! Remember who got you that work visa and this apartment. I'm all you've got, so don't piss me off. I know Miami called. You plan on going back? I made you a deal, didn't I? I intend on standing by that. Appreciate that. I play for you until I find my mom. Then I'm done. Okay? Okay. Let's go. I don't want you to be late for work. - Line up! - Hey, you heard the man. Let's go! Line it up. Let's run some routes. All right, guys. Listen up. We're gonna run Tango Option 26. Go! Go! Come on, Coach! You plan on making this hard at all on me today? Barnum, get out there and give him some pressure. Lorne, get on the line and block. Let's go! Go! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. - Hey, hey, hey, hey! - Hey! Hey, that's enough! - That's enough. - Easier hitting a woman? - I never touched her! - Barnum, get off the field! You didn't think I would have found out? I already told you. I never... Hey. Be strong. Mr. Porter? Mr. Porter? Mr. Porter? What happened? Oh, you fainted during practice, and you blacked out for a while. Your coach sent you in. I'm Nurse Brittany Kim. What was the last thing you remember? Getting hit hard. Do I have a concussion? Uh, well, we're not sure yet, but we're doing some scans to check for brain trauma. Really? I feel fine. Hey, Richard. I'm Dr. Santiago. How are you feeling? Good. I'm ready to get outta here. The reason you blacked out was not because of a concussion. So then I don't need to sit out long. You suffered a seizure this morning. A seizure? You were out for nine hours. Have you been experiencing headaches, memory loss, nausea? Get to the point. We found several lesions in your brain. Lesions? Damaged tissue caused by tumors. So, what are you telling me? Are you saying that I have a tumor? We believe you have a form of glioblastoma multiforme. It's a tumor in the brain. There's a number of treatments and therapies that we can try first to reduce the tumor. Permanent brain damage or death can result. We know this is difficult for you, but you need to get treatment right away. Mr. Porter, we're not fi-- Yeah? What is it? Rich! How'd you get the key? I'm his landlord. You might want to keep the deposit. Lovely. - Rich! - Rich! Any idea where he might be? Where are you? I need you to go back to the hospital. I made all the arrangements. It's one of the best hospitals in the country. You have nothing to worry about. The league would have caught this early during the physical. Okay, look, we're taking you back to the hospital, and you're gonna stay there. Don't worry. We'll clean up your place and move all your things. - I'm not giving up on her. - No one's saying you should give up on her. I'll take these. You make phone calls on the other half. And if you find something, let me know, and I will check it out. We're in this, too. - I got to pack. - We'll help. We're all outside. Why do you keep saying "we"? Mama. It's nothing. Mnh-mnh. Mama, what happened? This is your room. It's small. - So, I have to stay here? - Yes. We are quite far from the city, and treatments are frequent. Plus, we can't risk you being alone again if you have another seizure. Wait. Do I share a room with someone? Yeah. We are undergoing lots of renovations right now, so there are no single rooms available. Visiting hours will be from 8:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. Is this you? Kid, do you speak English? What, is he deaf, too? Mr. Porter, this is Darrell. I believe you two are teammates. I have to room with a kid? Yes. The children's ward is shut down, and we are pairing patients with GBM. Also, your coach thought - that since -- - No, you don't understand. I'm not rooming with a kid! Can you keep your voice down? My time and patience is growing thin with you, so I will be frank. This is your room, you are to be paired with Darrell, and you are to stay here at all times. Don't leave without my permission. And don't ever yell at me again. You understand? - Mm-hmm. - Mm. All right. Make yourself at home. Treatment starts at 3:00. There's not even any TV. Yep. I'm gonna die. I got to run some errands, so do me a favor and just don't tell Nurse Ratched. What? Oh. Yeah... you too. Uh, can you take me here? St. Matthew's Orphanage. Just wait here, okay? Thank you. Well, I do remember her, but she doesn't work for us. She worked as a missionary that helped the orphanage. She would only come by from time to time. Do you have an address? She was with a mission group from the States, but I'm not sure where she took residency. These children are going through the hardest time of their lives. They're learning at a young age on what it's like to have faith. They will all go far. My mom did all this? From what I recall, she was one of the best at it. She was really creative on how to connect with the children. I'm sorry I couldn't be of more service. That's okay. Thank you for your help. - God bless. - Thanks. Let me see. These old tires aren't sitting right... rubbing. It might need a new paint job. Checking it out. Thank you. You speak English? About those things that I said... I forgive you. Don't be afraid. Of what? This? I'm not. Why are you shaking? Do you want to play a game with me? I remember this game. Electronic football? Does this thing even work? No. Something new. What is this? "'The 100 Yards of Life.' The magical game that can heal." "10-yard pass. To move forward 10 yards, try a new dish that you've never had before. Time limit is three days. If you don't do this task in the given time limit, you receive a penalty, and you must move back 10 yards." You should try balut. It's high in protein. Uh, you know what? I think I'll try to find something new in the cafeteria. "10-yard power run. Join a support group and make new friends." Hey. What are you doing? I joined the Cebu Saints. Okay. "No-huddle play. Give up a bad habit. Every week you give up a bad habit, you move up 5 yards. Every time you do the bad habit is a 5-yard penalty." You getting it? Got it. So, this game really heals people, huh? It has. - Do you like it? - Yeah. It's gonna be fun. Hey, why the Bible verses on the back of the cards? Because it's by God. It's how the magic works. Hmm. What are you doing? I always pray for my patients. You had a seizure again, causing you to black out. How are you feeling? Like I fell and hit my head on the toilet. Well, Darrell brought you breakfast. Mm. Thank you. - He said you wanted to try it. - It's balut. What did I tell you? It's from the cafeteria, like what you said. They make this at the cafeteria? Well, it's protein-rich. And you should have it while it's hot. All right. How do I... I don't know what I'm doing. Duck embryo, one week old, feathers and bones partially formed. Enjoy. One important thing. What is this? Salt. Salt. Here's to "100 Yards." All right, so, you have three more to check, and I have four. No. I have seven more to check. You have four more to make calls on. Rich, stay in the hospital. I mean it. I can't sit here while I need to be looking for her! - Rich, hey, calm down. - I'm losing my mind. Listen to me. I got this, okay? Just find something to do at the hospital to keep yourself busy. We will find her. I promise. Do you wanna play with me? Do you have anything else that we can play? Oh, yeah. Okay. Tess, let me just start by apologizing in advance. I know this isn't easy. I'm sure you understand that we just need more details before we can move on something like this. Okay. All right. Okay. Let's, uh... Okay, let's start with -- And, please, as many details as possible. When you were attacked, how did you get away? Um... He finally just, uh... He got tired and let me go. But you said you escaped, right? I did. I clawed at him. And he got tired and fell over. But you realize Rich had no scratches on him? I don't remember. I'm trying to block it out. And tell me again -- Why did you not go to the police? Because I was scared. You can't trust anyone here. Tess, do you remember packing your clothes? - What are you talking about? - When you saw me, you had a bag filled with your clothes. I'm just trying to put it together in my head. How did you have time to pack your clothes if you were struggling for your life, trying to escape? How did... What the hell are you doing? You said you wanted a story. "The bigger the story, the bigger the pay" -- That's what you said to me. No. - What have you done, Tess? - What do you care? You had no hesitation writing the story about his brother, and now you want one on me. Do you really think that Rich is gonna be your friend - after all of this? - I need you to leave. You know, there are plenty of other reporters who are willing to pay for the full story. The door. So, you're treating Rich Porter? Yeah. He's a handful. He has a temper, from what I hear. Yeah, but I try my best to be patient with him. I do see a lot of pain in him, though. Like Dom? Yeah. Scary how much he reminds me of Dom. Be careful. Of? Getting too involved with him. It's not how you're gonna find your peace. I know he's not Dom. I'm just doing my job, and I won't give up on him. - Okay? - Okay. Okay. There you go. Thank you. What'd you do with them? You're not allowed to be drinking during treatment. You're not allowed to go through my things. I need it to sleep. That's an excuse. We have many other methods to help you with sleep. That's no excuse to go through my stuff. Is this what you do with your fiancé? Hmm? Go through his things? See if he's messing around? Don't talk about him again. Go ahead and drink all you want. Hello? Okay. I'll be right there. Hey! It's okay. I got him. I got him. So, oh, you're so handsome. Where are you staying? - No. - Huh? "No" what? Come on. "No" what? - No, Tess. - Tess? Come on. Where you staying, huh? Where you staying, huh? Aah! Oh! Aah! - Hey! - What?! Thanks for letting me borrow your phone. Rich? Rich? - Hey. - Hey. - Get in the car. - Hey. I tried to drink myself to death, but I didn't have enough cash. Wait. Do you have about 10 bucks? That should about do it. Let's go. No. No. All right. Get in. Ow! We're here. Thank you. No more. You understand? If you leave one more time -- I really do need to start playing the piano again. Your mum taught you to play the piano? Yeah. I was really good. And when Logan was born, I wrote him a song. I called it "Logan's Song." She loved it. So, where's Logan now? He's dead. I'm sorry. What happened? We were on our way home. He had this, uh, model car. Something that we'd both built together. I wasn't really paying attention to him much. I was getting text after text from friends and girls. Kept trying to talk to me. And I kept just putting him off. I eventually put my phone down to listen to what he was saying to me. And he was talking to me about how I was his hero. And I looked over, and I smiled. It was the last thing I ever heard him say. Not a moment later, I hear him scream. And I look up, and there's an animal in the road. All I could see was trees and glass and... ...dirt. I looked around to see if... if Logan was still in his chair. And I saw him. I got him, and I wrapped him up. And he was cold. And he -- he was cold because he just... he wasn't there anymore. They said it wasn't my fault. But I know that if I was paying attention, none of this would have happened. I killed my family. And now I'm gonna die. You're not going to die. - Think about your mum. She -- - They're gone. All of them are gone, and I'm to blame. I'm scared. I don't -- I don't know what I'm supposed to do anymore, and I'm scared, and I don't... It's okay. It's okay. Rich. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have done that. I... Sorry. Juan? Hi, Mommy. Bring this to the kitchen. But I don't need you to watch me, too. - Rich. - Look, about last night... - No. - ...I was... Look. I didn't do any of these things. It's a gossip magazine. It's not even credible news. Yeah, but it's still really serious, which is why I need to make sure that you don't go in the city, - at least for now. - Why? You think -- You think I did this? Of course not. Good. Okay, I'll be right back. - Okay? - Okay. Rich Porter? - Hey, we're talking to you. - I don't want any trouble. Hey! You think you can come here and abuse my sister, huh? She's a liar. Take that! Dumb thug! Where's the knife? Hold it! Get Rich out of here -- now! Let's go! I'll take care of this. Just go. Get out of here. I'll cover you. Go, go, go. Hurry, hurry. Get in the car. Hey. How you doing? Hey. How are you? She's a con. She's a con. She fabricated everything. She was your source. What the hell's going on? She was playing Porter the whole time. And now she's playing me against him. We know you wanted the story, Ray, but we didn't send you there because you said you needed it. We sent you there because you said you would write a story that would fix his image for the league. Now it's blowing up in our faces. The story's not over. Just give me a week. Give me a week, and I'll get you what you need. What's up, dude? - How's the water? - Good. Nice. All right. I need to know who you are. Just a dying man trying to figure things out. And a man who's hiding something. I lost contact with my mom a little over a year ago. She went missing. And I know that she's here somewhere. That's the reason why I'm here. I'm not running from anybody or anything. She's the only thing that I care about. Did you do those things to that woman? No. I promise you. She's just trying to get a payday. How can I believe you? He's having a seizure! Darrell! Darrell! Stay with me. Help! Help! Buddy, stay with me. Stay with me. He's having a seizure! - Why is he doing this? - It's all right. It's okay. - Why is he still... - Come on. Let's go. - Darrell! - We've got him, all right? It's gonna be okay. Does it hurt? It does now. I didn't even notice it before. Look... about last night, I'm sorry. It's okay. You weren't yourself. Earlier, those men... The police got one of them. And the other -- They're still searching. But don't worry. They'll get him. When the knife came at me, I thought that's how it ended. All I could think about was leaving everybody behind. Coach, team, Darrell... ...and you. And that terrified me. - It's okay. - I was so scared. It's okay. How is he? - He's fine... - Is he okay? ...thanks to you. Let's go see him. With two minutes remaining, Papua New Guinea is rushing down the field for another touchdown. We need to stop them. Yeah, we got to stop them on the third down. Otherwise, Papua New Guinea is gonna run the clock. Break. Move! Hike! That's it, baby! That's it! - Yeah! - Kelly Barnum has recovered the fumble, and it's Saints' ball. Hey, how you doing with the game? I have to finish my painting and make the first step to my dream job. What's that? To be a quarterback like you. You know, I can teach you how to throw a spiral, if you want. - What was your next card? - Um... go out on a date with a special someone or with a new crush. I have to pair up two friends for one of my cards. - Maybe we can help each other. - Yeah, yeah. Let's look for someone we can ask out here tonight. - Uh... - Hey, lady! Want to go out with Rich Porter? Don't worry. We'll do that later, bud. Anyways, Coach has me set up with a meeting with a sports agent tonight for when we recover. Maybe I'll put in a good word for you. Tell him that you're an up-and-comer. Yeah? All right. And the Saints offense takes the field with less than a minute remaining. Right. All right, let's watch us win. Hut! Oh! Come on, Miah! Come on! You got this! I can't handle the pressure, guys. - I can't. - We got this, bro. - Focus. - That guy! That guy over there. I'm gonna kill you! Where's the ball? Ha! Have faith in yourself, bro. - Come on. - Yeah, yeah. All right. Let's win this thing, yeah? - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - You want that slant? - Yes! It's yours. - Option 29, slant and go. - Okay. - Yeah? - Yeah. All right. "Saints" on 3. - 1, 2, 3. - Saints! This will be the last play of the game. Hike! And the ball's up. Joey Kalay catches the ball on the slant for a touchdown. Saints win. Saints win! - Yes! - Whoo-hoo! That's what I'm talking about! - Whoo! - Thanks, buddy. Get! What are you doing here? What are you doing here? Um, Coach set me up with a, um... I think we got set up together. Oh. Okay. 'Cause Darrell asked me to come. He said it was for a game or something. Mm. You hungry? Mm. So, you hid in a dirty locker for an hour? I had no choice. I was a freshman being stuffed into a freshman's locker... so that when he would come by and open it, I would jump out and scare the crap out of him. That was like a ritual to be welcomed on the team. We all had to go through it, but... That's so cruel. Oh, but so funny. - Oh, thank you. - Thanks. You're welcome. Would you like some wine with that? Uh, no, thank you. Thanks, though. You must feel invincible. Sorry? Just being in love. I think it's... got to, single-handedly, be one of the best feelings in the world... to be able to have that one person, your soul mate. Someone you would walk through the pits of hell just to be with them at the end of the day. Makes you feel invincible. I want that. I just don't know if she's out there for me. Or if I can... even make someone feel invincible. I bet your fiancé feels that way. I'm sure he does. I'm sorry. Wait. Hello, Richard. I'm Dr. Ng, your neuro-oncologist. May I have a word? You responded very well to the chemo treatments -- shrinking the tumor down to an appropriate size. Based on the test results, we feel we can move forward with preparations for your surgery. Okay. What about Darrell? I can't discuss that right now. Why? Just... At least tell me he's gonna be okay. Every patient responds differently to treatment. Unfortunately, for some, surgery is not an option. Richard, I know you two are close. Darrell, he may not make it to Christmas. I'm going to speak with his mother next. "The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want. He makes me lie down in green pastures. He leads me besides still waters. He restores my soul. He leads me in paths of righteousness for his name's sake. Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death... ...I shall fear no evil, for you are with me. Your rod and staff comfort me. You set a table before me in front of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil. My cup overflows. Indeed, goodness and mercy will pursue me in all the days of my life. I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever." Is that Logan's song? Do you know? Yeah. You all right? I've had time to accept it. My first love, Dom... ...my fiancé... ...he took his own life. And... ...I kept thinking that it was my fault. Like I could have done something to help him, you know? But then, I realized that he just lost hope... ...in himself... ...in the world. He was sick. And it could have been anyone else. So... that's why I became a nurse. To help illness, any illness, and to... ...and to help me forgive myself. It's not easy, I tell you. I'm trying. I am. But... ...we just got to have faith. And that's when we start healing. I don't know where God is or if he's even listening. You know, when Jesus was crucified, his disciples felt the same way. I mean, 'cause they felt that he wasn't there. They couldn't see him. They couldn't feel him. Then, one day, they went fishing. Caught nothing the entire day. And there was this man on the shore that shouts, "Cast your nets on the other side," and that was what they did. And they caught so much fish. And then they realized that it was him. Still watching and still helping from a distance. And then one of his disciples was so happy that he jumped off the boat and swam towards him. How far did he swim? 100 yards. So don't give up on yourself. All right? Hey. Are you in pain? "Smile at everyone I see for one whole day." Mm. How's that going? Much better now that you're here. Been sober for a month, and I have not complained today. All right. You're in the red zone. Oh, I am. That's 'cause I'm awesome. I'm almost done with my painting. One more, and we'll be tied. Yeah? What are you painting? My friend who helped me make this game, "100 Yards of Life." All right, so, this card - reads that... - Don't! Red-zone plays are secret. Okay. How about we get you in the red zone? Yeah! That was perfect. That was perfect. All right. Give me another one of those. Are you sure you haven't thrown before? Here it comes. Good job. That was perfect. They could be brothers. - Thanks. - All right, you ready? - Here we go. - I'm happy for that. I didn't know what to think about Rich, but Darrell loves him. Rich is a good kid. He's just misunderstood. - And Darrell, he's so bright. - All right, here we go. When he was about 8, his cancer took a turn for the worse. He had a seizure that put him in a three-day coma. When he woke up from his coma, he was a different little boy. What about you, Berry? Any family? Football. My team is my family. And, right now, I got a boy fighting for his life, just like you. Yes! That was perfect. And I think we're tied now. That's what I'm talking about. Hey, little man. We got you a little something. Christmas came early. Yeah, well, I knew a guy, who knows a guy, who knows Santa. Well, who's it from? It's from the board of hospitals in Cebu. Yeah? What's it say? They heard about the game, and they want to sponsor it to hospitals all over the Philippines. And when you get better, you can present the game to foundations all over the world. It's gonna help so many people. People like us. And when we're both out of the hospital, I promise -- We'll help heal the world together. All right? Come here. - We did it. - No. You did it. How are you feeling? Good. Sorry. All right. - I can walk. - Hmm? I can walk. Okay. Slowly. Okay. Oh. You okay? Okay. Let's just take a seat, okay? Okay. It's okay. You need to come check this out. That's impossible. No. I saw him do it. Hello? Okay. You got an address? Okay, got it. Thanks. I got a lead on your mom. Can I go with you? Please. Okay. Come on. Nothing. All right. Let's go back. Wait. No. One more. Please. No, it's late. You're exhausted. One more? - I need to keep looking. - You need rest. I'm taking you back to the hospital. I'm not giving up. We're not giving up. But being stressed right now isn't good for you. We can do this another time. I don't have any more time! I'm losing everything. We fight together as a team. Remember? I can't lose you, kid. What about Jeremiah? He can throw for me. I'm not talking about the football team. I'm talking about life. Your mom was a good friend to me, and I want to find her, too. But, right now, you need rest so you can fight your own battles. Every road leads to a dead end. You honestly think I'm gonna find her? We have to keep the faith that we eventually will. This game is far from over for you, young man. God is closer than you think, and I need you to see that. Can't sleep? The woman that helped you create "100 Yards of Life"... ...was she a volunteer at the hospital? This is her. This is my friend. Can you tell me about her? Hi. Um... - Mm. - Mm! Okay. I know what you need. What are you doing, Tess? - Were you following me? - I'm doing my job, Tess -- trying to find the truth. The truth? All you care about is the big story and money. What is that in your hand? - Is that drugs? - We are not having - this conversation. - 'Cause it looked to me like you were about to accidentally drop it in somebody else's house. This is none of your business. No, it is my business, Tess! It became my business when you lied to me on the record and I put that lie in print. It became my business. I do what I need to do! Does that include faking a facial accident and fabricating assault? Does it include that, Tess? Does it? It's easy for you to stand there and judge me with your fancy watch. You have no idea what my life is like. You get to fly home first class to your beautiful home and nice car. I have nothing. And I do what I need to do for my family to survive. You didn't have to do this, Tess. You wouldn't pay me for the story, so I went to a magazine who would, and they gave me really good money. But you made it up. You lied. And now you're here, trying to plant evidence to support that lie. It's just a story. Tess, it's a life! It's a good life. Christ, it's a life you're trying to ruin. Don't you get that? What about my life? He never laid a hand on you, did he? Hitting myself with that stone was easy compared to the life that I have to live. I deserve the life that Rich threw away. I need it. Please, just go home. They'll never believe you, Tess. Not in a million years. Really? Really. Hitting myself with that stone was easy compared to - the life that I have to live. - What's going on? Well, I guess I got what I came here for. The truth. Wait. Wait! Wait! Tess Sulay. You're under arrest. You have the right to remain silent. Any statement you make may be used against you in a court of law in the Philippines. Did you send Juan? No. He saw my face and reacted. I tried to stop him. I didn't want you to get hurt. Just my reputation, right? No. - I did horrible things. - You did horrible things to me. And for what? Your own gain? But you know what I realized? I realized I never really treated you that well. I'm sorry I wasn't able to give you what you wanted. And I'm sorry for pushing you into doing this. No. I'm sorry. I was just hurt and confused. I ruined everything. And I hurt people that I love. Why? Because I'm selfish. And because when I felt like I was losing you... ...I fought... ...but I was just scared. I'm ready to pay. You already did. I'm not pressing charges. You're free to go, Tess. What about the drugs? The police never found any drugs. Rich. Bye, Tess. We'll be waiting for you when you wake up. And we'll have ourselves a good, old-fashioned barbecue waiting for you. And balut. Mmm. My favorite. Good luck, kuya. I'll see you soon, toto. Okay. I wish my mom was here. I'll be by your side the entire time. I promise. Making me feel invincible. The surgery went well. We managed to successfully remove the tumor from his brain. However, there were complications. What happened? During surgery, his heart stopped for 7 1/2 minutes until we revived him. But he's okay, right? He's alive, but due to the loss of oxygen to his brain, he slipped into a coma. It is too early to measure the amount of damage he sustained during those critical moments. But we do not know when or if he'll ever wake. Kuya. They said you died, but came back. You saw it, too, didn't you? It's beautiful, isn't it? The colors, smells, the sounds. Did you see them, the people glimmering with light? I'll see them again, too. When I came back from that place, I could see them. People who were here but became angels in the next. Ray! That's where I learned that the world was sick, that we just can't see, but we feel it. And now I know why God sent me back. To help heal more of his children that he loves so much. To serve. Your mom knew how. Now it's your turn, Rich. Please help them any way you can. In this world, there's no such thing as goodbye. Only It means... I'll see you soon. He's awake! What about Darrell? Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen. You saved my son's life. I knew you were a man with a purpose to serve others. Just like Darrell. He won. Now serve with your new life. Help others in need. Be good to everyone... just as my son was. Philadelphia selects... Kelly Barnum, linebacker. The 100-yard triumph. Familiar to American football, when a team battles for every yard until they reach the 100-yard mark, a touchdown. The same saying goes for another game, one developed by a child and played by those who face true adversity. A game that requires everyone to fight as a team and to fear nothing in order to achieve everything, fighting for every yard in order to truly live. This game is "The 100 Yards of Life." A game played not only to heal the physical ailments of the body, but the metaphorical cancers, as well. Anger, regret... ...addiction, grief, and fear... ...are some of the many ailments that hold us back from truly living our lives. More importantly, it helps us to understand the second chances that are given to us. Former Colorado quarterback Richard Porter witnessed the power of this game firsthand... ...coming to the Philippines, facing darkness, only to find light after making the triumph, along with a dozen others the game touched at St. Thomas Hospital. Now Richard Porter is no longer pursuing football... ...but something much bigger. Oftentimes in life, we believe when the clock starts to run out, we think the game is over. But it's only the second quarter. Hi. Hi. Come in. So, I got you... this. Thank you. I think someone needs a haircut. Thank you for making me feel invincible. - Hello? - Hey, Rich. This is Henry. I received a call from one of your leads. Are you sitting down? I know you. I'm your son. I'm sorry. I... I don't... Shh. It's okay. I'm here now. Can I play you something?
