[upbeat music] [bright music] - Here we go. Three months of hard work and dedication, is about to pay off. - Stanley. Oh, hey Stanley, what's up? - Walter, you've arrived just in time. The moment has arrived. - Really? - Absolutely. You need to be prepared to handle all the media. That's about to descend on our little hamlet, my friend. For history is about to be. - Fantastic. - Here we go. [Stanley yells] Does that taste like raspberry to you? - No. No, thanks. - Oh, Walter. I promise one day I will perfect the raspberry soda. If it kills me. - All right. Wish you luck with that, my friend. [bright music] - Good evening, gents. - Chad. - Hi, Chad. Aren't you gonna introduce us? - Right, Kathy-- - Cindy. - Right, right. Cindy. These were my roommates, Walter and Stanley. - Hi. - [Both] Hi. - You'll have to forgive them. They're are a couple of A kids from over at the university. They don't get out much. - Well, it's nice to meet you. [tender music] - I miss Cindy at the gym. She was doing a squat thrust and I was, you know, pumping some iron and... Well, what could we say? - Not much. I guess. - Well guys, don't hurt yourself with your little experiment. Right this way... Right this way, baby. [tender music] - You know, I'm so tired of that blow hard. Egg heads. I'm a robotics engineer, Stanley. And you, you're a chemical engineer. One of the most prestigious universities in the state. What does he have that we don't have? - Cindy. [tender music] - I'm tired of it. I'm gonna out and get a drink. Are you coming? - Oh, no, no. I think I'll stay. [tender music] - Fine. [tender music] [Stanley laughing] - [gasps] Oh. [tender music] - You know when I saw you in that leotard, I thought I was gonna pull a groin. You know, Stacy-- - It's Cindy. I can't believe you can't remember my name. - Does it matter? - No. [bright music] [bright upbeat music] [equipment beeping] - Betty, can you check the main line on the hydraulic? I'm still getting a red signal when I run the diagnostic. - Yes. [door bangs] - Good morning, Stanley. - Good morning. - Did you enjoy the birthday present I sent you? - Oh, was that you? I didn't get it, but it's not my birthday until May. - Well, I figured why wait? [laughs] I bought the shopping cards, you know. So did you like the cookies? I baked them myself. - Well, I don't eat sweets. So I fed them to the guinea pigs in the testing lab. - Oh. - Oh, don't worry. Whatever's in store for them is much worse than eating your cookies. Walter, I'm sorry I'm late. I really didn't get much sleep last night. - How could you, with Chad and Cindy in the next room all night long? - Yeah. - You know, I'm sick of it. You hear me Stanley? I'm sick of it, okay? That neanderthal continues to hook up with a different hot girl every single night of the week, when guys like me and you well... don't. - It is a mystery. I mean, you and I both have more intellectual capacity and our digit is minimist than he has in his entire body. - I think it's his entire body that's the problem. Only we could get the female perspective. - Well, I've always thought-- - Thanks Betty, but we need an expert opinion. [door creaks] [door bangs] - Greetings, gentlemen. And to you, the lovely Ms. Betty. - Good morning, Dr. Carmichael. [chuckles] - And how is everything in the world of science today? - Well, that depends. Chemistry and Engineering are going just fine. It's Biology that we're having a problem with. - I see. A little problem in the love department then. - You could say that. - It's our roommate, Chad. He has the intellectual capacity of a slug worm. No, wait. That would not be fair to the slug worm. [laughs] - But he has a super hot girl over every single night of the week. - Mm. And you boys are wondering why these super hot girls are not attracted to you. - You see our problem, Dr. Carmichael. - Yes, Stanley. But you know, you're not the first intellectual shall we say, who's had this problem. Brains versus brawn. It's as old as reasoned thought itself. - No, it seems like the brains are losing. - But you must consider, is this roommate of yours really happy? I mean, night after night, after night, the gratuitous, meaningless sexual relations with one beautiful bombshell after another. Can this really make a man happy? - Yes. - Yes. - Well, if you insist on putting this hypothesis to the test, all you need to do is look around you. The tools you need are right here at your fingertips. - Do you mean? - Yes, my boy. Play to your strengths. A love potion. Stanley, you're one of the country's foremost chemical engineers. If you can't design a love potion, surely no one can. - I don't know. - Yet Dr. Carmichael, we appreciate your help. And I wanna score with the ladies as much as the next guy, but don't you think that's a bit extreme? [woman moaning] [bright music] [woman moaning] [bright music] - We start tomorrow. [bright music] - I want to see what you're doing. [bright music] [Stanley cheers] [bright music] - Are you sure? - Am I sure? Am I sure? - Yeah. Are you sure? - No. I'm not sure. - How are we gonna be really sure. Unless we field test it? - Guys. I'd be happy to help out. - Really? - Sure. I mean, well, I'd be happy to help out with Stanley's potion. - Well, you know, she has a point. If we're gonna accurately verify that this potion works, we're gonna have to try it separately. - You're right. It's the only way we can be sure. - Well, I've got Betty to help me out. - Yes. - What are you gonna do? - Hey, hold on. Hello? Is this Olga's Swedish Massage Parlor? [upbeat music] - Hello. [upbeat music] - I'll be right with you. [bright music] - Hi, John. - Who? - John Smith. You have the three o'clock appointment? - Oh, that's right. Meet John, you Olga. [laughing] [tender music] - Nice to meet you. [chuckles] - Nice to meet you. You don't look much like an Olga. - You don't look much like a John Smith. [bright music] - Fair enough. - Can I assume this is your first time? - Oh, no. I mean, there was his time at Camp Macamack with Gracie Blonsky when I was in high school. Don't really sure if that counts because I passed out when I saw her bra. [tender music] - I meant your first time getting a massage. - Yes. Yes it is. - You seem a little nervous. Make yourself comfortable. Would you like some water? - I thought the water was for you. - No, it's for the guest. - I couldn't possibly drink water that hasn't been tasted by somebody else first. - That's very odd. I've never heard of that. Is it part of your religion? - It is now. Yes, yes, exactly. That's it. [tender music] Thank you. How are you feeling? - I'm fine. How are you feeling? - I'm good. Good. - Why don't you take your clothes off and get on the table. I'll be right out. - Yes, ma'am. [tender music] - Now Betty, it is very important that you keep an accurate track of your feelings for me for the duration of this experiment. - Of course. - For a baseline sample, tell me how you feel about me now, before we administer the potion. - Oh, Stanley. I don't know if I can explain how I feel about you. - Well, you must. This experiment won't work unless we begin with someone who has absolutely no lustful feelings for me whatsoever. - Oh. Oh, yeah. I have absolutely no lustful feelings for you whatsoever. And the truth be told, I fairly despise you. - That will do. - I mean, you're not anything like a real man should be. - Okay. - You know, with great muscles and good looks and great a job and a great big... eyes. - Enough, I get it. You're qualified for this test. - Thank you. - Now, just take a sip of this, and it should take effect in just a moment. [suspenseful music] [Betty coughs] Oh, is it taking effect? [Betty laughs] - I'll say it is. [bright music] Oh yes. [bright music] - Oh. - Oh, oh, oh. Stanley darling, are you okay? Oh, no, no. - Betty? - Yes, Stanley. - What happened? - What happened? You don't remember? - Not really. I mean, I remember testing out the love potion, and then things get a little bit fuzzy. I think I was dreaming about having sex. - It wasn't a dream Stanley. - Well, it must have been, because in my dream I was having sex with a really beautiful woman. And you're the only one standing here right now. - You know what? You're right. It was a dream. Your love potion was a complete bust. - Oh. [footsteps thudding] [door bangs] Women. I'll never understand them. [bright upbeat music] - How are you feeling, John? - Great. - But don't be afraid to go to sleep if you'd like it. - I'm not gonna pass out this time. That's for sure. - You have some stiffness going on here. - You have no idea. - I think I do. - Really? Does that mean I could get one of those happy endings I've always heard about? - Absolutely. [amorous music] - Happy ending? [speaking in foreign language] [back thudding] Get out of here! Go! I don't wanna see you, go! [speaking in foreign language] [door bangs] [speaks in foreign language] [bright music] [door creaks] [door bangs] [bright music] - What happened to you? [bright music] - I'm not entirely sure. I think I tried to have sex with Betty and she hit me. It's all a little fuzzy. What about you? - I spent the last half hour down at the police station trying to explain to them why a half naked man was running down the middle of the street. - You guys are pathetic. - What do you mean? - I've been listening to the whole conversation. You, Stanley, you get close to a woman and your knock yourself out? Real smooth. - That's not exactly how it happened. - And you, you can't even get laid in a massage parlor. And they're getting paid. - Well, not, not all massage parlors are that way. - Olga's parlor, right? That place has been shut down three times by cops for solicitation. Those girls don't know a damn thing about giving a real massage. If you know what I mean. - But-- - You guys are so sad. Enjoy your slide rules and comic books. I'm gonna get some sun. I got a date with Bandy. Or is it Becky tonight? [door creaks] [door bangs] - You know, maybe he's right. [doorbell rings] [tender music] I mean, we just don't know what to do when we're around a beautiful... woman. - Hello. - Hi. - I'm Tammy. I just moved in next door. - I'm uh... Walter. Yeah, I'm Walter. - And I'm Stanley. Welcome to the neighborhood. - Gosh y'all. Thanks. Listen, I hate to impose, but I'm just moving everything in, and I realized I don't have any light bulbs. Any chance I could borrow a couple? - Well, sure. Anything that we have is yours. Anything you wanna borrow, any time. I have a nice car. Do you drive? - Just the light bulbs, thanks. - What do you do for a living? - Oh, I'm a model. - Of course you are. Stanley, you wanna get those light bulbs? I think they're in the kitchen. - Yes, they are. - Stanley, get the light bulbs. - Oh, all right. But you owe me. Please, come in. - Thanks. [door bangs] - Well, here. - Okay. - So tell me what brings you to our neck of the woods? - Well, I had to move because I broke up with my boyfriend. - You, you, you, you. You don't say. - Yeah, he only wanted me for my body. He didn't respect my mind. - So intelligence is important to you? - Yes. Very important. - You know, I'm a scientist. I work as a robotics engineer over at the university. - Is that so? - Yep. I'm pretty smart. - That's great. Listen, can you have a check on your friend with the light bulbs? - Light bulbs. Oh yeah, yeah. Excuse me. - Sure. [cupboard doors banging] - Where are those light bulbs? - Forget about the light bulbs. This girl is hot. We've gotta try something. - Are you serious? First of all, the love potion is a complete flop. And second of all, even with the love potion, that girl is way out of your league. - Yeah. You said she really likes intelligent guys. And she's so pretty with her long silky blonde hair and her big beautiful green eyes. - Snap out of it, Walter. - Well, we've gotta think of something. - Why don't you just talk to her? Ask her out. I mean, if she's into intelligent guys. - Maybe. Nah, that'll never work. - Yeah. You're right. - [Tammy] Hi. - Well, hello. Whose little cutie are you? - I'm Tammy. I just moved in next door. - Well, things are looking up in this neighborhood. - Things definitely are looking up. [chuckles] - What do you say you and I step inside? - Sure. - Have a seat. - Okay. - Well, let me welcome you properly. - Okay. [bright upbeat music] - Found the light bulbs. - Hey guys. Did you meet the new neighbor? - Yeah, we met her. - Thanks so much, Walter. You're a doll. [Chad laughing] [bright music] - Dr. Carmichael, can I ask you a question? - We'll certainly, my dear. What's on your mind? - It's about Stanley. - I thought I detected the spark of young love in your eyes. - Am I that obvious? [chuckles] - Only to an old romantic like myself. - Well, I'm not obvious to him. I volunteered for stupid love potion test, he can't even remember it happened. Obviously he's not interested. - I wouldn't be so sure about that, Betty. Love has a tendency to manifest itself when we least expect it. And it certainly does not come from a bottle. These boys are inexperienced in the ways of love. You've got to be patient. Give it time, my dear. Give it time. - [sighs] I don't know how much longer I can. [bright music] - The love potion test was a complete bust. We've got to come up with another plan. - I agree, but whatever we do, you're not gonna get that supermodel into your bed. You need to start off with something small, and then work your way up to something like that. - Gentlemen, good morning. - Dr. Carmichael. - I take it that the love potion experiment did not pay off as planned. - You could say that. - We need to come up with a new idea. - [sighs] Stanley. Why don't you just try asking a girl out? - We've thought of that, but it seems a risky plan. And Walter, why don't you try internet dating or something? - I don't know. This seems kind of cliche, doesn't it? - Didn't you just try to get a happy ending in a massage parlor? - Yeah, so? - [scoffs] Never mind. - Gentlemen, gentlemen, if I may. You've tried Stanley's solution with limited results. Perhaps the time is right to go with Walter's specialized talents. Maybe you'll have more luck. [bright music] - You mean build a woman? - Why not? Since the flesh and blood type seems to be so mysterious to you, perhaps you should operate in your own field. - Yeah. - Dr. Carmichael. - You must trust me, my dear. Trust me. - He's right. - You mean... - Yeah. If we can't get a girl to have sex with us, we'll build one that will. Get ready, Stanley. It's time to put operation super sex program into effect. [bright upbeat music] Press the neural button and put [indistinct] software. [bright upbeat music] This is gonna work. [bright upbeat music] [doorbell rings] [bright upbeat music] Hi Tammy. Chad's not here. - Oh, I'm not here to see Chad. I'm here to see you. - Really? Come in. [bright upbeat music] - What are you working on? - Oh, science stuff. - That's what I wanted to talk to you about. I've been thinking about taking some classes at the university. - Well, that's nice. - Yeah. Well, I can't be a model forever. But I audited some classes and I'm not sure if it's for me. Everyone there seems so smart and intimidating. - Well, you're smart too. - Oh, I don't know. - Listen, Tammy. Everyone's there to learn. You've just gotta have a little confidence. - Really? - Yeah. You'd be surprised at what a little confidence will do. - That's good advice, Walter. [chuckles] [bright music] Okay, well then. Gotta go. Thanks. - Thanks. [upbeat music] Swell. [bright upbeat music] [equipment buzzing] [tense music] - Stanley, Betty, I give you the artificial light construct experiment, Alice. - Wow. - Oh my God. Can she speak? - No. I still haven't installed her neural pathways yet. [keyboard keys clacking] [computer buzzing] You must make sure that her love emotion is fixated on well, guys like us. - What? The nerdy, brainy scientific type? - Exactly. - Walter, I had my doubts, but this woman is absolutely perfect. - That was the easy part. Getting the neural pathways right, [gadget buzzing] that's what you can call [indistinct] [bright upbeat music] [gadget buzzing] [bright upbeat music] - Hello, Walter. Hello, Stanley. Hello, Betty. [hands clap] - Wait till Chad sees this. - Oh. [bright music] - Chad. [door bangs] Chad, are you home? Chad? - I didn't see his car parked out in the driveway. He must still be at the gym. - I wanted him to be here, okay? So that when this little number can't resist us anymore and she jumps all over us and makes mad passionate sex with us, I want him to see the whole thing. - Excuse me? [suspenseful music] - Well, you know what I mean. [door creaks] - Hey guys. [bright music] - Oh, hi Tammy. What are you doing here? - Oh, I'm sorry. Chad said I can come over anytime and use the pool. Hope you don't mind. - Nah. No we don't mind. - Tammy, let me introduce you to Alice. Alice, this is Tammy. - Hello. [footsteps tapping] - You are a hot chick. - Thank you. - I must have you now. - Oh my. [chuckles] [bright music] - What just happened here? - I... We... I don't know. How do these things keep happening? - You're just lucky, I guess. [bright music] - I must have you now. - So you've said. Listen, Alice. I think you're awfully cute, and ordinarily I'm pretty adventurous, but we just met. [bright music] Thanks, guys. Your friend is out of this world. - Sure. Anytime. [footsteps tapping] Alice. - Yes, Walter. - What was all that about? - What do you mean? - We mean, why did you have sex with Tammy? - She is a hot chick. - Yeah, but you're supposed to be fixated on nerdy science guys. - I am programmed to have sex with hot chicks. There is nothing about nerdy science guys. - There must be something wrong with her programming. - There's nothing wrong with her programming. Okay? See right here, it says... hot chicks. But that's impossible, unless... - Unless what? - It must be Betty. She's the only one who could have done this. - Betty? Now why on earth would Betty do something like this? - Well, it's obvious to everyone except you bird brain, that she's madly in love with you. - Betty? Don't be preposterous. In love with me? - Yep. - Betty, our lab assistant? - You betcha. - Meek little mousy Betty, in love with me? How's that possible? - Oh, not only is it possible, but I'll prove it to you. [tender music] [phone ringing] - Hello? - Hello, Betty. Yeah, this is Walter. - Yes, Walter. Listen, I just wanted to let you know that we're having a little get together this afternoon. Nothing too fancy, just a few friends over for some drinks. We'd really like you to come. - Sure, sure. Wait a second. Is this one of those things where I show up thinking I'm a guest and then you actually want me to serve drinks or cocktail weenies or something? - Oh no, no, no. We'd be happy to have you as our guest. As a matter of fact, Stanley wanted to make sure that you are invited. - Stanley? Really? [tender music] - Oh yes. He's really looking forward to seeing you. - Okay, then. I look forward to it. [chuckles] - All right, bye bye. There you have it. She'll be here. - In that case, there's only one thing left to do. - Well, yeah. I've got to do a little reprogramming. - No, you fool. We need to plan a party. And I don't have anything to wear. [tender music] - I can't believe it. Stanley's invited me to a party. - Excellent. Congratulations. - Could it really be true, Doctor? Do you think after all this time, he's really interested in me? [tender music] - But of course, my dear. But I must warn you, don't fall into the same trap that those boys have. Love is not something that comes from a potion or some sort of mechanical device. Take it from an old scientist. Love is something that science will never conquer. And I think that it's a pity we even tried. - [sighs] Thanks Dr. Carmichael. [Betty laughing] - But now my dear, I must warn you. If you want to catch that young boy, you have got to take the bull by the horns. Lord knows, he's never going to do it. - Right. [laughs] [tender music] [bright upbeat music] - Pretzels are making me thirsty. [door creaks] [tender music] - Oh, shake it, kids. - Chad. - Whoa. Hold the phone here. Are you two dorks actually throwing a party? - Yes, actually we are. - With real life people? Not your Sci-Fi gigs Hispanics, with little fuzzy antennas? - No with real life people. As a matter of fact, here's one of our party guests now. Alice, this is our roommate Chad. Chad, this is Alice, our friend. - Nice to meet you, Chad. - Let me get this straight. You're here with these two chowder heads. - Yes they are my friends. - See? - Oh darling, darling. Let me show you the errors of your ways. What do you say you and I go someplace quiet where we can get to know each other better? You know, just the two of us. - If you were suggesting we engage in coitus, then I must tell you I am not interested. I am only interested in hot chicks. - It's okay, baby. That's okay. The chester can roll any way you like. [tender music] - Please do not touch me again. I am only interested in hot chicks. And the odor of your cologne, is making me ill. - Seriously? You'll hang out with these two torques and not me. There is something wrong with you, sister. - I actually don't think anything's wrong with her. [doorbell rings] [tender music] [doorbell rings] [door knocking] - Where is he? - Betty. Hello to you too. - Hello, Walter. Sorry. Now where is he? Okay. Oh. You, come with me? - Betty. What's gotten into you? Oh. [tender music] - What the hell man? Is it just me, or is every girl around here got cuckoo bananas. - It is you. [tender music] - Betty. What's gotten into you? - I've been working in your lab for three years Stanley. And in all that time, you've barely paid me any attention. - Well, that's not true. I recall getting you a fruitcake last Christmas. - That's because I was your secret Santa. - Well, that is true. - No, I mean... really notice me. - Oh. Oh dear. Damn it. - Come on, nerd boy. [suspenseful music] - Oh. - You are a hot chick. I must have you now. - The more the merrier. - [gasps] So you were the one who reprogrammed her. - I'm afraid so. - Cool. You're smart and sexy. [bright upbeat music] - I don't believe it. Stanley? [Betty and Alice moaning] Stanley? - Oh, believe it. [bright music] [doorbell rings] - Excuse me. [bright music] - Hi. I hope I'm not late. - No, not at all. Thank you so much for inviting me. You're so sweet and -- - Yeah. That's that's me, Mr. Sweetie. - Oh, what's wrong with that? - You know what? Nothing, I guess, I'll take it. [tender music] - Tammy baby, thank God. Someone with some sense has finally showed up. How're you doing baby girl. - I'm good, Chad and you? - Better, now that you're here. What do you say you and me both that Popsicle stand and spend a little time together. - But it's Walter's party. - You guys go ahead. I'll be okay. - See? He doesn't care. You don't understand the daft head. It's been devastating. - Look, Chad. I'm sure you've had a rough day, but it's Walter's party, and I've come over to see him. - You too? I just don't get you, blondes. - And you never will. Ever again. - But him? - What's wrong with him? - Yeah. What's wrong with me? - That's it, I've had it. I'm off for the gym. Maybe Susie will be there. - You mean Cindy? - Whatever. [tender music] [door bangs] - You know, I actually kind of feel a little sorry for him. - Don't. He's not half the man you are. At least not where it counts. - Well, I wouldn't be so sure about that. - I am. Walter, It's like you told me. All you need to have is some confidence. [tender music] - You know what? You're right. - That, and me. Luckily, you're a bird. [tender music] [bright music] - So, you and Betty after all this time. - Yes. It was meant to be. She could only resist my natural charm for so long. - Uh-huh. - And you and that super sexy model from next door. Who would have guessed. - Well, she could only resist my natural charm for so long. - I see. [door bangs] - Good day, gentlemen. - Dr. Carmichael. - Hello, sir. - And I suppose you have big plans for the weekend? There's a science fiction convention in town. I imagine that's where you'll be. - Can't, got a date with my girlfriend. - Yeah, me too. - Girlfriends. Excellent. So I guess Alice worked out after all. - [Walter And Stanley] Hm. - You know, Dr. Carmichael, love doesn't come from a mechanical device or from a potion or any of that nonsense. - You don't say. - Love comes from somewhere deep inside. And some guys, well, they have what it takes. Guys like me and Stanley. Ain't that right, Stanley? - Correctamundo. - Good. Very good. So what becomes of Alice here? Now that your super sex experiment is done? What are you going to do with her? - We don't know. We were thinking of donating her to the university. - Stanley, would you like to get some lunch? - Yes. I have some time. Dr. Carmichael, would you care to join us? - Oh no, no. I have plenty of work here to do in the laboratory. You boys run along. - Okay. [door bangs] - Let's see if we can put you to some good use. [computer buzzing] [gadget buzzing] And how are you feeling, my dear? [Alice screaming] [bright music] - No, wait. Wait, wait. Hey, not so fast, be careful. There's lions everywhere. But wait. [Alice screaming] I don't have to. [indistinct] [bright music] - I mean, you and I both have more intellectual capacity and our digit is minimist than he has in his entire body. [bright music] - Oh, that's right. Me, John, you Olga. [laughs] [bright music] - Oh, I'm sorry. Chad said I can come over anytime and use the pool. Hope you don't mind. [bright music] - Oh, Stanley. I don't know if I can explain how I feel about you. [bright music] - I am programmed to have sex with hot chicks. [bright music] - [Tammy] Hi. - Well, hello, whose little cutie are you? [bright music] - It's Cindy. I can't believe you can't remember my name. [bright music] [speaking in foreign language] [bright music] - Love is not something that comes from a potion or some sort of mechanical device. [bright music] [bright upbeat music]
