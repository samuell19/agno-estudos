Prepare for takeoff man this is going to be biblical Captain... it hasn't even begun! hello? well hello there dear this is Mrs. Schumacher from Church hello Mrs. Schumacher sweet boy have you been outside yet tonight it's just that the moon is so spectacular I wouldn't want a bright young man like you to miss it it must be past midnight mrs... well the light's just so glorious how about you go outside and sneak a peek It's even better than your television stories I don't know Mrs. Schumacher I'm supposed to be asleep. Mrs. Schumacher? Are your parents in? Mom! What?! Mrs. Schumacher's on the phone Damnit Ashley! That better not be the TV! No! She wants you to go outside! Outside? Yeah, she seems worried or something Okay, well, shut that off and go to bed! hello Meredeth? Is everything okay? Ash said... well he told me something was going on Outside? Well I guess I could The moon? What? Meredeth you seem strange, are you sure you're alright? ok ok, I'll go wake Peter and we'll be right outside. Just hang on Ash? What is it? SHH this is the emergency broadcast system please stand by... the following is a message from the Department of Defense. At approximately 8:50 p.m. Eastern Standard Time instances of strange behaviors were being reported to local and state authorities at record levels. It is believed that these incidents are associated with looking directly at the moon. For this reason we urge citizens to stay indoors at all costs and to refrain from looking directly at the moon until this state of emergency has ended. This station serves the greater Rockford area. This message will repeat Mom!! Ash! Stop! Wait Ash! Ash? What's going on? When you were asleep Mrs. Schumacher called That nice old lady on Elm? yeah but she seemed weird and she asked me if I wanted to go outside and look at the moon Holy crap yeah she talked to my parents man! So.. do we go and look for them? No we shouldn't go outside Then what do we do, there are no adults Robbie! Robbie!! What? Somethings going on! There was this thing on TV, then the phone call, the door, and the moon! Ok Jesus, calm down. Take a breath What is going on. So they just left? Alright well they did not tell me I had to watch you guys Do you wanna watch a movie? Robbie. Why aren't you listening! there was an emergency broadcast from the government saying to not go outside and look at the moon no matter what and before that Mrs. Schumacher called and told me to go outside and look at the moon My god Mom is right, TV is rotting your brain! You know what, look. if you're joining us now we're covering possibly the biggest hoax ever pulled in the tri-state area. Some devious pranksters got control of multiple live broadcasts and aired a fake emergency alert I repeat the emergency alert that was on your screen just a few moments ago was a hoax and there is no need to panic That is stellar Boy Ash, that's a relief. For a minute there I thought you were serious about that phone call That's because I was Chuck! Now for a special weather report the moon tonight is more radiant than ever before I can't even believe it myself so if you're watching this go outside and take a look for yourself Heck, bring your whole family you do not want them to miss out on our glorious celestial neighbor is really putting on quite a show why don't you get as many people together as you can and go outside look skyward just really get an eyeful you do not want to miss this moon It's like they're all possessed or something That's because it's not a prank Alright Ash, start from the beginning what can we do We could... hmmhm wait Captain Commander issue 563 The Night of the Cerebral Insecti! The recebral what? in this issue, The Captain is at a Trader Colony when the inhabitants are all infected by these bugs that can sort of control them and make them brainless see? and the Captain was the only one on the whole planet not infected Wait. He escaped the mines of Gorlath? What issue is this again? He figured that the bugs had to have a weakness he noticed during the daytime the bugs moved the colonists indoors so one day when they were all inside he broke all the windows and let the sunlight in and the bugs burst into flames and he saved everyone that's awesome I know and and that's what we gotta do we have to wait here for mom and dad and figure out how to fix them do you really think this'll work? Of course, Captain Commander never lies We need to get out of here What? I said we need to get the hell out of here! but what about mom and dad they're gone Ash gone okay and we can't stick around here and become like them we need to get somewhere safe somewhere where they can't find us at least until we can figure out what's going on okay. but if you read this I think... Damn it Ash! I get that you're used to being some mindless freak but I'm not! alright look - it's just this isn't an episode of Captain Commander we cannot be heroes I'm with Robbie okay good let's get to the garage wait but where are we going shouldn't we find the police or something? No, no we need to get out of town somewhere secret where we can just wait and think just us The bunker. The bunker? yeah that'll work Come on it's like they're zombies just look at them Robbie wait I think that's mom slow down Robbie! it's not her Ash so stop it We're not gonna end up like that We're here this is the bunker? yeah me and Robb.. Robbie and I made it a few summers ago are you okay? yeah I'm fine so do we have a plan well we wait till morning that's it for now and tomorrow we can go to the next town over and see if it's also affected it's my fault what? they'd still be here if it wasn't for me they'd know what to do and the three of us wouldn't even be out here No Ash.. I saw mom Robbie I know I saw her ok guys I really have to pee Chuck just go find a tree or something Hello?? who's out there? hello??? Charlie? Is that you? Don't worry sweetheart.. Mommy's here. it's been too long I'm sure he'll be back soon he should have been back a while ago I'm gonna go look for him Chuck? Chuuuck Chuck!! Chuck! Chuuuuuckk This isn't funny Chuck? Come on Chuck, please! No! Chuck! Chuck! Ashley baby is that you? Thank god! I'm right above you okay, so look up! Look up at me Look up at me! Look up at me right now! what do you think you're doing private Captain? Are you gonna quit? nah, didn't think so no private of mine would look in the face of catastrophe turn tail and run. So what have you learned from all these years of watching me? It's easy to give up but it's hard to be brave I'm just afraid. I'm afraid all the time What if that's all there is? Do you remember episode 242: The Haunting of Lunar Base Delta? Well, what do you think would happen if I stayed on my ship and didn't get involved? Even when I was afraid I still knew my duty. You? You were afraid? It was the ghost of a giant man-eating alien of course I was afraid but bravery isn't just not being afraid bravery is being afraid and still doing the right thing anyway so you can keep living in fear and be just like them... or you could stand up and be who you were meant to be Mom and dad... wait Captain! With the brain bu... With the cerebral insecti how'd you know what to do? You see Ash, when I really paid attention their weakness couldn't have been more obvious the truth is son you don't need me anymore ASH! Robbie Ash! Robbie! Ok, back there... I know! you were scared, so was I but now we need to save them So grab Chuck and let's go What are you crazy? What did I say back there we need to... Robbie we can't leave him too! The sun's gonna rise soon and I don't know what that means exactly but when it happens we need to be with mom and dad I just I can't.. bravery isn't not being afraid Robbie it's being afraid and doing what's right anyway all right
