I..I don't drink Get the doll a lesbos light. Did I die? Honey, you just begun to live INTRO MUSIC A land without lesbians is no land for me, a land without lesbians - a dichotomy! When I see two lezzies strolling down the street, I just want to start tapping my feet. Ginger Rogers I would never share with Carey Grant or Fred Astaire. I don't need no man to call my own, cos the isle of lesbos is my home! A land without lesbians is no land for us, why be coquettish when you drive a bus? Solan voce and a right hand hook, is the kind of stuff that makes us cook. In a bowling alley, its a strike or spare when a two-tongued jasper gives a blue-eyed stare. And a great big grin when she wipes her chin, oh the Isle of Lesbos is our home! A land without lesbians is no land for me, don't want a Tarzan swinging off my tree, when I grow old and grey my hair, I wanna Jane in my rocking chair. Sly and awny to some gals I slick, But I dig muscles rippling all a jig, you can keep your frillies and your womb Cos the Isle of Lesbos is my home! A land without lesbians is no land to be, who wants a nation without liberty! Arkansas just ain't the place to sit on a pretty face. Peel off my lipstick and unzip my gown, there's a brand new bold dike that's arrived in town! You can keep your Paris and your Rome, cos the Isle of Lesbos is my home! The Isle of Lesbos, yes the Isle of Lesbos, oh the Isle of Lesbos is our home! I think the girl's cottoned on! Sisters, looks like we have a new member of the congregation. Praise Sappho! Sister April, as high priestess of the exulted temple of Sappho, I officially welcome you to the Isle of Lesbos. Glory be! I'm Emphysema Jones, your spiritual guide in this dimension. And you are here by the grace of her excellency, our supreme leader and Empress for life the huskiest, the bustiest, most illustrious Blatz Balinski! BURP NOISE I run this joint Hi, I'm Doris Got any plans for Saturday night? And I'm Viv, we are an item so don't you get any funny ideas! Don't mind her, she's the jealous type. I saw you giving her the fish eyes RANTING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE Shut the fuck up the both of ya! Any more lip and it's a one way ticket to the moon. Ladies! This ain't no bowling ally. You is profaning a temple. The lord works in mysterious ways, and the Devil wears many disguises. Nine times out of ten that Devil is waving a serpent between his legs. We bite him and we smite him! Here, on the Isle of Lesbos, Hallelujah! Back in the real world, you was frustrated. Out of touch with your inner feelings, get my drift? I think so... Who will bear witness for this child? I'll do it. (cheering) Blatz, Blatz, Blatz, Blatz! Back in 1957, it wasn't easy being a dyke. Especially in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. I was born big: 22 pounds, 8 ounces. After my mother came out of the coma, she ran off with the Fuller Brush man. My father was so mortified he joined the Foreign Legion. I was left alone with sixteen brothers, all of them working in a brewery. I'm their only sister, see? So they's wants me to be Sandra Dee, keep my mouth shut and scrape the shit stains out of their overalls. No dice! Babes and beer's always been my passion! I could out drink, out brew, and out screw all of my brothers combined! I smooched and banged half their dates before they could even get to first base. I was like Godzilla, eating Tokyo RAWWWW!!! Nobody could stop me! Till one night, my brothers surrounded me at the local drive-in Doris Day was up on the screen being tight-assed with Tinkerbell Rock I'm in the back of the Chevy going down on Marian the Librarian. MUSIC It was a bloodbath! I pop a wheelie and crash down on two of my brothers, then I smash through the windshield and slice up the rest. I'm ready to take on the whole town. But the highway patrol brings me down with a tranquillizer dart. WHOOSHING NOISE LOUD THUD I told the judge that I was an orphan, but there ain't no pity for a dyke in Milwaukee. It took ten guards to strap me to the electric chair! As they pulled the switch, I laughed in their faces! HA! Suddenly, everything went white. I was sizzling with a thousand volts! My pelvis was doing an Elvis and I could smell my Bryl cream baking. I was about to become toast. I popped out of thin air and crashed to the floor. Here, on the Isle of Lesbos. And that's the truth, so help me Sappho. Viv and I lived next door to each other in Cucamonga, California. Even when we were kids, we knew we were different. When we were little dykes, we got Ken and Barbie dolls for Christmas. My mother caught us rubbing our Barbies together. But that wasn't the half of it. We put the Kens on trial. They were condemned to death. Death by dog food! We smeared them in Alpo, then splashed them full of lighter fluid and lit a match. The playroom caught fire, then the house, and pretty soon all of Cucamonga was in flames! Our mummies wouldn't let us play together any more. Life without Doris wasn't worth living! We made a suicide pact just like Romeo and Juliet! Only there weren't no Romeo! We threw ourselves in front of a truck on route 66. I'll never forget the sound of those breaks! SCREECHING BRAKES Just as we were about to be smashed to smithereens, we woke up huddled together here on the Isle of Lesbos. That's terrible. You ain't heard nothing yet. I was born in a broken down shack, about ten miles south of Chattanooga. When you're born black and on the wrong side of the tracks, honey life ain't no bucket of gravy. My Pappy was a no good drunken layabout and when he weren't beating up on my poor Mama, well, he was grabbing at my little black ass. I can tell you, I didn't lose my cherry horse-back riding on the Prince of Wales. Soon as I was old enough to up and out, I caught me a ride on the Chattanooga choo-choo and ended up in the Big Apple. I soon found out it was rotten to the core. Ladies, a white man can be pussy-whipped, make no mistake about it. But a black man never got the news that Lincoln freed the slaves. They sweet talk you one minute and the next thing you know you're peddling your ass for some mother-fucker who never worked an honest day in his life. I drifted from one sorry son-of-a-bitch to another. Until one day, I found me a woman. Preach it, sister! And I realised I would never need a man for the rest of my life. Hallelujah! Unfortunately, the pimp who I disgraced caught up with me in bed with the woman of my dreams. He forced a bottle of liquid Plumr down my throat and dragged me kicking, screaming, and naked to the top of the Empire State building and threw me off the top floor. Child, I never thought I'd hit Terra firma, I passed birds, clouds, air planes, just flapping my wings and praying for the good Lord to intervene. And just as I was about to disintegrate on top of a kosher hot dog vendor, abracadabra, I was standing steady on my two feet, here on the Isle of Lesbos. Praise Sappho! Now you see how you got here babe? You mean I don't have to go back to Bumfuck, and marry Dick Dickson? Honey child, your prayers have been answered. Bumfuck is old news. You're a bonafide member of the sisterhood now! You don't ever have to go back! There's a new age dawning and you're a part of it. Anoint the sister! MUSIC I can't understand what got into our little April's head, Ma! Why, she ain't even sent a postcard since she jumped through the mirror. Well, maybe there weren't no postage stamps on the other side. That looking glass always was a bit peculiar. You remember when Uncle Purvis was adjusting his dentures in front of it? Why, he fell clean through and we ain't never heard a word from him since. I told you not to buy it from that travelling salesman! Come to think of it, he did look kind of Jewish! MUSIC CAR HORN MUSIC What in hell and damnation?! Pa! MUSIC Shit! Now Pa, I got to buy some corn pork for supper. So mind your manners and keep your shirt tail tucked. HORSE BRAYING Now why anyone would want to leave a town like Bumfuck is God's little mystery to me! INTRO MUSIC Just to the right of Texarkana and a stone's throw the left of Little Rock. There's a town that the Lord sent just like Manna when he preached to the weary of the flock. You can give up hope and hot springs. I wouldn't park my carcass in Pine Bluff. If you want to pull at my heart strings, there's one town that's really got the stuff. Bumfuck, Arkansas. A Christian kind of a town. Bumfuck, Arkansas. Well I'd like to show you around! There's Barney Doodle and his barber shop, we got twelve churches and an old car hop. Bumfuck, Arkansas. A one horse, god-fearing town! Bumfuck, Arkansas. It's home sweet home and it's white. Bumfuck, Arkansas. The Negroes leave town before night. We got one Jew and a Catholic too but they'll convert when the Klan comes through. Bumfuck, Arkansas. A one horse, god-fearing town! Other states that belong to the union don't want no truck with the past. They're content with dope and degradation, that's the price when you're moving too fast. Here at home we like it slow, couldn't give a darn, much less a damn. Wouldn't pay a nickel for a poor no show, we only reproduce for Uncle Sam. Bumfuck, Arkansas. where brother and sister get wed Bumfuck, Arkansas You're better off baptist than dead! We don't allow no Commies here, or city slickers who are queer. Bumfuck, Arkansas. A one horse, god-fearing town! Bumfuck, Arkansas. An old-fashioned kind of a place. Bumfuck, Arkansas. We shoot you right in the face. Southern hospitality is Bumfuck's speciality. Bumfuck, Arkansas. A one horse, god-fearing, one-horse, god-fearing - don't you just love it?! - a one-horse, god-fearing town! BOWLING ALLEY NOISES GROWL We showed them wimpy dykes didn't we girls? Blatz, you rule the universe. This dyke only operates on diesel. Nobody can beat the Isle of Lesbos! LAUGHING Oh Wanda! Make mine a baby sham, hmm SQUABBLING I love babe... and all its wondrous ways! SCREAMS SCREAM NOISE FROM OUTSIDE Get your faggot ass in here now! What do you want? Fruit bowl Who's that? Oh, that's Lance the Nance, our fruit bowl slave. Well I thought no men were allowed on the Isle of Lesbos? Somebody's got to scrub the toilet and mop the floor. Dirty work beneath the dignity of a lesbian. You see this you sloppy fairy? How many times have I told you not to kiss the ash tray? You got ya lipstick all over the joint You know the rules! No lipstick! Leave me alone, you're always bitchin Get back to work you good for nothing fruit cake. It's my day off! I want to go to Bloomingdales! You ain't going nowhere except back to the dungeon! Blatz! How could you be so mean? What'd I do? Ouch! Be careful with that ice bag Lance... Will you be my friend? It's against my religion. Pretty please? I guess so gee I never thought I'd meet a dyke who had a heart! You mustn’t judge a bull by it's cover Blatz is really very sweet. Once you get to know her. Yeah, so was Hitler's mother. If you don't like it here, why don't you leave? What do you think I'm on holiday?! There's only one way I can leave Lesbos I have to be rescued by a handsome heterosexual hunk, who falls madly in love with me. Fat chance of that happening I'm the only male in the joint Something must have made you come to the Isle of Lesbos Bad fucking luck. It was an accident! I guess I just have shitty karma. INTRO MUSIC I was born to dance an engaging gay romance Broadway used to have my name in lights. I was lead in the ballet played in Carmen by Bizet and every chorus boy was in my tights. The world was at my feet but in the throws of heat I slipped on a tube of K.Y. gel I flew through the window of my Park Avenue Penthouse and landed in this lesbianic hell! Now I'm Lance the fruit bowl slave! No reviews but still they rave! Wash the windows, then you mop the floor. Dykes are driving me insane, I don't need no ball and chain to remind me that I can't walk out the door. I'm just a prisoner of love, I need a helping glove to pull me back into Lloyd Webber's gads! If I don't get the fuck out of this lesbian show, I swear to God I'm gonna murder Blatz! Hit it Maestro! JAZZY MUSIC BREAK Won't someone please rescue me from this isle of dykery! I'm going crazy from this lesbo jive! I promise to behave, I'll even be your slave, as long as I don't have to...!!! Prince Charming, where are ya? PIANO MUSIC On the house What's the matter? You ain't thirsty? Is there something wrong babe? Has that fruit bowl been doing his Joan Crawford number on ya? I'm gonna pulverize that pansy! Oh Blatz, it's not Lance It's that.. Well I guess I'm just homesick. Look doll, you gotta get Bumfuck out of ya skull Ain't ya glad to be a full-fledged dyke? Sure I am! It's just that.. Well I don't feel right not telling my parents. Looks like we've got a coming out party! Break out the beer! What's going on? You've gotta be born again! I already am! Bumfuck baptist! That's not what this means, April. You see, coming out for a lesbian is a rite of passage What if my parents can't accept me being a.. ..you know. If your parents love you, they'll accept you no matter what. And if they don't, fuck 'em! The straight world ain't as logical as the Isle of Lesbos, toots. Them heteros don't care about bumping off the planet, as long as they can stop two dykes from bumping in the bedroom. If every gay man or woman in the real world were to come out, pretty soon there wouldn't be a need for the Isle of Lesbos. That's right, Doris. Then we and the heteros can put our heads together and find somebody else to hate! You mean like the Jews! Now you're getting the picture! You ready to take the plunge doll? Gee, I don't know.. Now or never babe Send them one from the sisterhood! INTRO MUSIC Dear Mom, dear Dad, though this letter's bound to make you mad, I can't hold the truth back any longer Dear Mom, dear Dad, though a husband you think I ought to have, what I'm trying to say in an old-fashioned way is that I hope you understand that I'm a la la la la lesbian.

As her parents we should both try and support her She's a yodel-lady lesbian - it's a crying shame She's a yodel-lady lesbian - you're the one to blame! If we had a choice we'd just as soon abort her! Though she never used to play with dolls Whoa thought she'd grow a pair of balls! Remember Ma and Pa I'm still your daughter! We love you just the same, though we're filled with guilt and shame You grew up to be a lesbian!

Cool it lady, I'm just dusting myself off Do you have any idea how much it costs to fix the roof in this dimension You girls are lucky to be alive If I didn't have a mind of my own You'd just be a mass of lesbian molecules bumping uglies in the great, dark, void [intro music] The pakkies in New Delhi, the North Koreans too, Pretty soon Saddam Hussein is aiming straight at you All the Yids in Tel Aviv dance the horror, they dance the horror they dance the horror they dance the horror around the flame, HEY! and when the Serbs get dropped a few, there's no one else to blame They got the bomb!

Radiation even wiped out Pat Robinson's headquarters in Virginia. Those dykes sure are ordering! [yawning] - Goodnight, Ma. - Goodnight, Pa. What'dya say, Ma? How about a little southern comfort? No, I prefer if we're apart! What in tarnation's gotten in to you? We've been married now on 40 years and I ain't in no condition to bear no more children! Just this once, let's do it for fun! Think decent. Just close your eyes and think of apple pie. My favourite dessert! When the lights go out in the farmhouse, and the chicken's roosting in the barn, Ma's laid down her knitting needles and the cat's curled up with the yarn. The children all have said their prayers And the parson's snoring in his sleep. That's the time that a married couple get up to more than simply count the sheep. Whip me, whip me, baby come on and flip me, baby Thrash my buttocks till I'm weak Beat me, beat me, baby Come on and eat me, baby treat your Papi like a freak. Bend down over, Rover, this ain't no four-leaved clover, I want to hear you shout for more. Mama's caught you wankin' You're gonna get a spankin' Are you sure you locked the door? Ma ate apple pie that's what the preacher cried, when we got wed in 56! He thought we'd take our vows, go home and milk the cows, instead we brought perversion to the sticks. Let me sniff your nightie, I'll swear to the almighty, that's the way I get my kicks. I want to wear Maxfactor, not drive a yellow tractor, rather be a woman, than a Hick. You're acting like a sister, so I made a rubber Mister, a toy that Sears and Robot doesn't sell! Grit your teeth and take it, it took all day to bake it Where the hell d'ya put that KY Gel? Ma ate apple pie, that's what the preacher cried, every Sunday in the church. We're just plain country folk, never tell a dirty joke, Ah, slap me one more time with that there birch! Ma ate apple pie, that's what the preacher cried, trust in the Lord, in his good work. We're on a holy mission but we won't get in position S&M is just our little quirk. Tie me up and trust me Ma you're getting kinda rusty add a little muscle to your tomb. Gosh, Papa you're so romantic! I'll go down like the Titanic. Just like on a second honeymoon! Mom ate apple pie, that's what the preacher cried, to the congregation in their seats. If you're into dope and sin, drop a dollar in our tin, but for heaven's sake please be discrete. You know, Ma? Maybe being a Lesbo ain't such a bad thing! Where'd you get that, Pa? If you can't beat them, join them! Why the fuck not? ORGAN PLAYS WEDDING MARCH Dick Dickson, do you take Lance, the ex-fruitball slave to be your man till death, or all that gay bickering bullshit do make you part? I do! Lance, what do you say, honey? Alright already, but I ain't gonna do no winders. April Pfferpot, do you take Blatz Balinksi to be your lawfully wedded woman to hug and to coo, to love and to woo till death do you part? I do. Anne-Marie, Mary Beth Yvette Belinski do you.. - I do! Cut the dialogue! And bring out the beer! I now pronounce you... Whatever! Aww!! Now that's what I call a happy ending! A land without lesbians is no land for us No more swear box, from now on I cuss! Though we're straight we'll never roam, cause the Isle of Lesbos is our home! A land without lesbians is no land at all, we'll bump uglies for the curtain call. You may not dig our lesbo verse, but in real life to be a dyke you don't rehearse! I never thought this isle was paradise, lesbians just take my... throw a dice. With Dick beside me I won't fuss as long as Greyhound has a bus. A land without lesbians is not my style, now I'm dating at least half the isle. I'm gonna trade my football for ballet, cause women put out if you're gay. A land without lesbians is no safe bet, even in a country where the sun don't set. You may be stiff beneath that lip, But in the Isle of Lesbos, child, you just ain't hip. A land without dykes... what a disgusting thought! My beer belly would be overwrought -- reproducing brats and slicing span. for some prick who wears a dental dam. A land without lesbians would be blasé with only one position in the hay. A little spice won't hurt the broth even for a member of the cloth. A land without lesbians is no land for us Goodbye real world, it's the isle of bust! Bumfuck may have had its home town charms but we'd rather bump and grind it in each other's arms. If you want to join us, we're glad to make some room It's better than a one-way ticket to the moon! You can keep your Paris and your Rome, cause the Isle of Lesbos yes, the Isle of Lesbos, Oh the Isle of Lesbos... yes, the Isle of Lesbos Enough already! Cause the Isle of Lesbos is our home! This is how I would have played the role 20 years ago... ALARM CLOCK RINGS Isle of Lesbos, can I help ya? Dick Dickson Have you got the wrong number? When she calls you on the phone, and says won't you be my own... and vows that she'll love ya forever more. You suddenly realise, that she'll reak of shrill surprise. if she discovers that your Jack instead a Joan. Bad connection, the lady won't eat meat. she'd rather chew a piece of fish attached to a pairo' teat. She's strictly kosher and her habits don't include man cause the lady is a dyke, a Terry-Anne. Hello? You degenerate faggot, What have you done to my April? Oh, it's you again! Listen, Dick, you're still not coming through clear. Give it another try! Bad connection, the lady won't eat fowl, Although she digs a little chick that she can call her gal. So tell the operator that you caught a tit in land. cause the lady is a dyke, a Terry-Anne. Hello? What's new? What's your name? I'm Lance. the fruit ball slave. Lance, if you don't put April on the phone this second I'm gonna jump through the mirror and punch your fruit ball.. out! You just don't give up, do you, Dick? Now listen carefully, I'm gonna tell you one last time. Bad connection, the lady is on a fast, she's slimming down on boyfriends so just forget the past. Mister, hang up on the phone, as quick as you can. cause the lady is a... - are you listening? Oh the lady is a... - get my drift? Yes, the lady is a dyke, a Terry-Anne. Gee, I'm gonna have to put this guy on permanent hold! There's a new age a-comin, Hallelujah! Hallelujah! There's a new age a-comin if you're queer. Hetro-sex will be passé, Swing your partner if you're gay! There's a new age a-comin if you're queer.

There's a new age a-comin round the mountain. Round the mountain! There's a new age a-comin any year. and on CNN we'll fornicate in the closet if you're straight! There's a new age a-comin if you're queer. Discrimination is disbanded. Same-sex love will be revered. Lock the hetros up in jail! There's a new age a-comin if you're queer.

As long as dykes don't mix with fags There's a new age a-comin if you're queer. Hallelujah! Hallelujah! There's a new age a-comin if you're queer!
