- I'M NOT SCARED - - Michele! - Maria! I fell! Where are you going? - They broke. - I told you not to come. Now what? We'll tape them. Let's go. Come on, run! - How gross! - They passed by here. There's a house! Congratulations, you finally made it. My sister hurt herself. - The others? - They're down there. - Who won? - Skull. - This place is mine. - Why? Because I saw it first. Finders keepers... Who's the rotten egg? You, because you came last. I had to stop because my sister got hurt. - You lose. - Who has to pay up? She does. No fair, why always me? Let's vote on it. He can't always decide everything. Let's vote, I say you lost. - Me too. - Me too. - Me too. - Me too. See? So what do I have to do? - Show it to us. - No way! - What does she have to show us? - Shhh! - You lost, so do it. - No. No? Aren't you going to say anything? Alright, but I won't play with you anymore, jerks! - Are you crying? - No. Stop! I'll pay up, I came last. Fuck! Walk across that. He was the Lizard Man... ... he could walk on walls. Then he became the Glass Man, if he falls he breaks. - What are you saying? - Nothing. Leap onto that branch and climb down. Michele... ... give me my glasses. - I lost them. - Mom will kill you. Wait here. A cave filled with gold and gems. - Did you find them? - Run, we're late. There's Mom. Where'd you go? I was searching for you! How many times I gotta tell you to stay nearby? Michele, this time... - We went... - Home, right now! Dad's here! Dad! You're heavy! Daddy's doll, gimme a kiss. Where were you? Playing by the stream. How long are you staying? For a bit. You broke 'em? - Again? - She fell. We can fix them with tape. - Michele, what did I tell you? - Never mind. Did you do your push-ups? - No, he didn't. - Yes, I did. We'll see, if you don't beat me, no present for you. - A present? What present? - What present? - You'll see. So... Christ, are your muscles made of butter? Come on. You're a sissy. Maria, help him out. Give us the present now! Anna, get the box. Easy! - A boat. - No. It ain't no boat, it's a gondola. - What's that? - A boat you only find in Venice. - With only one oar? - What's an oar? A stick that moves the boat. - Pretty! - No. You can't play with this. The Police from the Artistic Heritage Unit... ... recovered two precious 16th century sculptures... ... attributed to Benvenuto Cellini. Whose turn to get the wine? - Maria's. - I don't feel like it. You go. - No! - It's your turn. - I'm not going. - Why not? - My head hurts. That's what you always say! Shut up, let me hear! Knock it off! Go, Michele. It's not fair. After the defeat of the fencing team in Hamburg... What happened? It's her turn to get the wine. In war, know how they'd decide who went on deadly missions? Whoever picks the broken one, has to go. It's your turn! You lost, go get the wine. So they bury him... ... and he remains in the belly of the earth... ... among secrets, corpses, bones, skeletons, and darkness. Where were you? Your Mom's looking for you. They're mad. Are the shoes comfy? We'll buy them. Hope I can convince my Mom, they're really cute. - Anna, what do you think? - Let me see. What do you think? How much you want for these? - How much are they? - It's a good brand. I've got other models, too. Pino, your son's here. - Where were you? - Wandering around. Wandering like hell! You know what time it is? It's almost 2! No one knew where you were. Your Mom went looking for you. You gotta stop doing whatever the fuck you please! If you wanna do as you please, then leave. Get lost. Get lost! Michele, come down! - What do you want? - Dinner's ready. Tell them I'm not their son anymore, I'm not coming back. - You're not my brother either? - No! - Then can I have your comic books? - No. That has nothing to do with it. Mom will get mad. - Where's Dad? - He went out, he'll be back late. - What's for dinner? - Mashed potatoes and eggs. Good morning! Did you fall out of bed? - I had lots on my mind. - What was on your mind? Give daddy a kiss. - I thought you were mad. - What was on your mind? - Tell us. - Sad thoughts. Get ready 'cause tonight we're gonna arm wrestle. Anna! Buy me some sausages. - Dad, when will you be back? - Late! Michele. One, two, three, red light! Michele. - What are you doing? - I'm not playing anymore. Want me to come along? Forget about him. Water... Are you alive? - Water... - What did you say? I didn't understand. - Water. - You're thirsty! You want water? - Thirsty. - Wait. Hungry. You're hungry? I don't have anything to eat. I have to go home now. If you want, I'll bring something tomorrow. Are you a child? What are you doing here? I know you. You're Amitrano's son, right? You better not come here no more. If I see you again... See them things? They're always hungry, they even eat bones. Michele... - What are you doing? - Nothing, just playing. Put everything back. - I don't want anymore. - Eat your meat. It gives me a headache. - I can't take this anymore! - Anna... If she doesn't want it... No big deal. Someone's coming in a few days. So no fuss and no whining. Who is it? A friend. - What's his name? - Sergio. What a funny name. A Dad and Mom are expecting a baby. But instead, two are born, one blond, one brunet. The brunet is normal, the blond is crazy. When she nurses him, he bites her and draws blood. The Mom doesn't want him anymore. So she tells the Dad to kill him. The Dad takes him up to a tall mountain... ... but he can't stab him because it's a sin. So he digs a hole and puts him in it. He brings him water and food so he won't die. So he... ... won't... die. Hi, Michele. What do you need? What can I buy with 500 liras? Don't know, depends on what you need. - Something good, do you have chocolate cookies? - No. Sweets are over there. A doughnut, a chocolate bar... Or a Kit Kat. They're all good. - Assunta... - What is it? If someone's hungry, what can they buy with 500 liras? They can buy bread. When someone's hungry, they buy bread. I wanted to ask you: ... do you know Felice, Skull's brother? Felice Natale. I hate him. Is he the one who feeds you? I saw him driving away from here... ... so I thought... I'm going home now. Okay? Bye bye. Are you deaf? Listen. Sorry. I thought of something. If you won't eat the bread, will you give it back? Let me explain. If Felice comes and finds it, he'll figure it out. Then I'll come get it. Listen... What's your name? What's your Dad's name? Mine is named Pino. Is your Dad named Pino too, by chance? - I'm leaving. - Coons... Did you say something? I don't understand. - Coons... - Coons? - What do you mean? - Raccoons. If you leave the window open, raccoons will come in... ... and steal cakes, cookies... - There are no coons here. Raccoons can bite people. Did you eat a piece of meat yesterday? It's very important. Are you my Guardian Angel? I'm not an angel. What's a Guardian Angel? The one who says true things. You can tell me, I won't tell anyone. I'm not an angel. I'm Michele. Michele Amitrano, fifth grade. Dead? - What? - Am I dead? - Dead? What? - I'm dead! I'm dead! I'm dead! I'm dead! I'm dead! I'm dead! I'm dead! Remember when Mrs. Destani... ... told us about the miracle of Lazarus? - Yes. When Lazarus came back to life, did he know he'd been dead? No, I guess he thought he felt ill. Do you think only Jesus can bring the dead back to life? Dunno, but my Aunt told me a true story. Once, someone's son died all mangled under a car. The Dad couldn't handle it, he cried all day. He gave a psychic all his money to bring his son back to life. So the psychic said: "Go home, your son will return tonight". The Dad waited, but the son didn't return... ... so he went to bed. Then he heard steps in the kitchen. He got up and saw his mangled son... ... with his brains dripping out. His son said he hated him, it was his fault he died. He left him in the street to go chase after women. And then? So his Dad set him on fire with gasoline. - He did good. - Sure did. - What are you doing? - I have to pee, go to sleep. - What do they say in Milan? - What the hell do you want them to say? They said it would end soon... ... it's been months! What's going on? I don't understand! You don't need to understand. The less you think, the less you'll screw up. It'll take time. It might take six months. - Six months? - Six months, a year, whatever it takes. My ass! Shut up! They ain't telling us anything! You don't need to know anything. You just have to keep the kid hidden. Hide him and stay cool. You've fucked up over and over again. He's the stupidest of all. Like I said, you're not capable. Relax. Relax? They ain't paying! They said Carducci had money coming out of his ass. Bullshit! Shut up! You're the worst here, 'cause you think. - Me? - Yes. Fuck you, expert my ass. You're an idiot, let me tell you! The news! Anna, turn off the light. Turn up the volume. Good evening. Human rights defense... ... and patience in negotiations, Carter says in Berlin. In Bonn tomorrow, the Industrialized Countries Summit begins. Alarm in Trent for a toxic cloud... I'll have one. They ain't gonna talk about it today either. - They didn't yesterday. - Well? I can't hear a thing. Here it is! Throughout the whole region, the search continues... ... for little Filippo, kidnapped in Milan. The Police are following new leads which seem to be promising. We will now air Luisa Carducci's appeal to the kidnappers. What the fuck does she want? I'm Filippo's mother. I'm speaking to my son's kidnappers. I implore you, don't hurt him. He's a good boy, well mannered, and very shy. I implore you, treat him well. The sum requested is steep... ... even for our family. - They'll cough up the money. You threatened to cut his ear off. I beg you not to do it. I must make another request: ... tell Filippo his Mom and Dad love him dearly... ... and always think of him. - We'll cut off two ears! Two! Who are you? I'm Michele, Michele Amitrano. Sounds like the name of a singer. I'm Materia Sergio. Pleased to meet you. Didn't they ever teach you to knock? Sorry. - Are you Pino's son? - What? - Are you Pino's son? - Yes. You're a quiet kid. I like quiet kids. Are you obedient, too? Then close the door and piss off. - What? - Close the door and piss off! Mom! Mom! - Who's that in the bathroom? - Let go of me! It's Sergio, your Dad's friend, he told you already. - How long is he staying? - A few days. Pass me the other stuff. - Where will he sleep? - In your sister's bed. - And her? - With us. Pass it here. - And me? - In your room. I don't want to sleep with him! I want to sleep in your bed, too. Don't be silly. You're too big, how are you gonna fit? - I'll make myself small. - Enough already! Come here. Come. I can't take it anymore. If you only knew... Don't you make it worse, do it for me. - Come on! - It's not fair. But it's not for long. You never change... You are my yesterday, my today, my forever. Restlessness. Now you can give it a try. Call me torment, come on, while you're at it. You're like the wind carrying violins and roses. Words, words, words. Listen to me. Words, words, words. I beg you. Words, words, words. I swear. Words, words, words, merely words between us. Damn it! You're Filippo, right? Your Mom says she loves you and misses you. She said it on TV yesterday, and she said not to worry. - My mother is dead. - What? It's a lie! Mommy is dead! So is my Dad and my Grandma, they're all dead and live in holes! Is your Mom blonde? Is there a painting of a boat in your house? It's not a boat. It's a sailing ship. See? Your Mom was on TV, you could see the sailing ship. She said that she and your Dad love you very much. Then why don't they come get me? - I don't know. - And why am I here? I don't know. You don't know anything! - Go away! - Stop it! - You're not my Guardian Angel! - Leave me alone! - Stop it! Stop it! Go away! I came here for you! - I came all the way here for you and you're throwing me out. - Go away! Alright, I'm leaving and never coming back. You'll be all alone and they'll cut off your ears! I'm not your Guardian Angel! - Wait. - What do you want? Please, stay. - But if you act crazy, I'm leaving. - I won't. - Why don't you open your eyes? - Come here. I knew you'd be back, the raccoons told me so. Not the raccoons again! Open your eyes. - I can't. - Just for a second. - You're small. - Well, I'm ten. - Me too. What grade are you in? - Fifth, and you? - Me too! We're the same! - Yes. - What are you doing? - Nothing, she's swimming. - She'll die like that. - She's broken anyway. - Where are the others? - By the stream. Salvatore was asking for you. Michele, come here! You upset your mother. She says you don't wanna sleep with Sergio. What'll Sergio think? I don't care. - Is Sergio your boss? - What are you saying? - He makes the decisions? - No, he decides nothing. He's a friend, that's all. Ain't you glad I came back? - Yes, I am. - Well then? I want to leave here. How come? You don't like it no more? Yes, but... Let's arm wrestle. Let's see. - What's your problem? - Nothing. If you're good, when I'm done with everything... ...we'll go to the beach. I promise. Really. I know you're awake. This is my home in Brazil. You can't see shit because my friend Paco's in front. He's dead. This is my wife, my lady. You have a Negro wife? Colored. Brazil's some country! Life costs nothing. Served, venerated... It's not like this shitty country. - Is Brazil far away? - Very far. Very. Sleep now. - What? - Sleep! - FILIPPO CARDUCCI IS ALIVE! - - I made a cake. - With cream. Come gimme a kiss. Go eat. Dad? He's out with Sergio. He's taking us to the beach next week. We'll go eat mussels in a restaurant! Michele! It's Salvatore. Go ahead. Bring him a piece. - Is it good? - Yes. Look what my Uncle sent me. - Nice, huh? - Really nice. This has an extendable ladder. This one even has a bed. This is a police car, it opens and has a siren. - He gave you all of them? - Yes. - This is nice too. - It doesn't open, I don't like it. I like it though. - Will you give it to me? - I can't, my Uncle will get mad. - But he's in America. - I can't. I'll give you some "Tex" comic books for it. I already read them all. Will you give it to me if I tell you a secret? A secret isn't worth a van. This one is, I swear. But you have to swear to God... ...you won't tell anyone, not even Skull. - What are you doing? - Leave us alone! Come with me. Know that house we went to? There's a secret hole in the courtyard. There's a boy inside, he's alive and he's crazy. - What's he doing in there? - Some grown-ups put him in there. His Mom went on TV, but they don't want to give him back. Actually, they want to cut off his ear! - I don't believe it. - It's true! His name is Filippo. I'll show him to you. - No, it's too far. - You don't like this secret? Not really. So you won't give me the van? Take it, I don't like it anyway. They cleaned you up! Who did it? - They came down and washed me. - They took off your chain. Look what I brought you. It's crumbled, but... More! Give me more! I don't have anymore. I gave you all of it. If there's any left, I'll bring it tomorrow. I have an idea. Want to go out? - Where? - Outside. - Where? - Out of the hole. - What hole? - Here, where we are. - This isn't a hole. - Then what is it? It's where you go when you die. How can I explain? This is a hole in the ground. Outside there's air, fields, everything. Let's go. Try, at least! I can't do it. I can't! - Just for a second. - It hurts. Try! The sea's down there, but you can't see it. Look. Do you like it? Watch. Listen... I have to go home now. I'll bring you back down. I have to go home soon because I have to set the table. - I'll stay here, but you'll be back tomorrow, right? - Yes. - Promise? - Promise. - What's that? - It's me. Will you bring me a sandwich with cheese spread tomorrow? - What's ch... - Peek a boo! I see you! From the nest it flew, now it doesn't go coo. Holy shit, it was Michele! Every fucking time I found things out of place. You wanted to set him free, huh? Get up, dumb ass! You're lucky you're your father's son. Really lucky. Don't move. Go. Get in! Good Salvatore, you were right. I gave you my word. Take the wheel and show me your stuff. - Now? - When else? Follow the slope and remember to brake. It's a perfect place for learning. A smooth start. You hold the wheel good. You're a real pro. Relax. Go slow! Rock! Ditch. Salvatore, look ahead. Salvatore, the rock! Brake, you're gonna smash my car! - What happened? - He was there, with the kid. What happened to you? He hit me. You did what to him? - Bastard! - I did nothing to him! How dare you hit my son? I'll kill you! Stop it! He wanted to set him free! Calm down! Let her go! Let her go! Let her go! Get off! What the fuck? What are you doing? You hurt him! Enough! Everybody piss off! - Anna... - Get out. Come on! Out! - What the fuck were you doing? - Nothing! She wanted to hit me! It's nothing. Rest now. Michele, listen to me. Promise me that when you're big you'll leave this place. Michele! Michele! Wake up. - What did you do today? - Nothing. Nonsense. Felice said you wanted to set that kid free. No, I swear, I pulled him out and put him right back in. - How many times did he see you? - Three. - How many? - Four. - Would he recognize you? - What? - Could he recognize you? - No, he can't see well. He always keeps his head under the blanket. - You talked to him? - No. A bit. - What did he say? - Nothing. He talks about odd things, it's hard to understand. - What did you tell him? - Nothing. Listen carefully. I'm not joking. If you go back there again, I'll beat you silly! If you go back, they'll shoot him and it'll be your fault! I won't go back, I swear. You gotta say: "I swear on my father's life that I won't go back." I swear on my father's life that I won't go back. Forget about him, he's not there. Don't talk about it to anyone ever again. Christ! What a mess! - Can I ask one thing? - What? Why did you put him in there? I don't get it. There are things that seem wrong when you... Don't think about it. Forget about it all. Go to sleep. Sleep. - What are you looking at? - There's a dog. - Where? - There. I don't see it. Then only I can see it. I thought you'd see it too, but I guess not. Hush! What'll we do now? Let's go back there. - Where? - To the abandoned house. Near Candela's farm. That's far. What if it starts raining? What if it starts raining? We'll get wet. Plus, no one asked you to come anyway. Want to go? I'm going, come along if you want. - So long as we don't race. - No races. You're not coming? Michele, are you going? Let's go home. If you shit your pants for a bit of rain, go home. Let's take cover! - He's gone! - I know where he is. Where? Tell me! - I'll tell you if we make peace. - Tell me! They put him in the caves near Candela's place. - Who told you? - My Dad was talking to yours and that guy from the north. Peace? Peace. Phew! Hey! - No one's home! - Same here! - Where are they? - Is anyone at your house? - No! - What'll we do? - They left. - All the better. I couldn't wait for them all to fuck off! Maria! - Where are the grown-ups? - At Assunta's shop. - What are they doing? - I don't know. Helicopters passed by and they all went out. They went into the shop and Mom said we can't go in. - When will they be done? - How should I know! I'm bored. Barbara, what are you doing here? Go home! - When are you coming? - Now. Go. Damn! - When will our Mom come out? - Soon. Let's go home. - But I won't go to sleep. - Then don't. There are two tomatoes. Put salt on, it tastes better. Hurry, it's late. What are you still doing up? Get to bed! But we haven't eaten! It won't kill you. Go to bed! We got here just in time. Why aren't you sleeping? Can't you tell them to shout softer? - I brought you some food. - What's going on? Eat and go to sleep. - Mom... - What? - He's dead, isn't he? - No one is dead! No one! Got it? You're too young. Enough, now eat. It's fine if you don't want to... ...but sleep. I'll be back in 10 minutes, if you ain't sleeping, I'll show you... - Are you crazy? - Quiet! I won't fucking do it! I ain't going to jail for you! The terms were clear: You'd deal with the kid. Whether things went good or bad... ...you'd deal with him. - Let's give him back. What do you think? It's the only solution. Let's set him free. We'll abandon him in the street, and that's it. What the fuck are you thinking? Shit for brains! We have to eliminate the kid! You fucking bumpkins. And you have no balls. Who do you think you are... ...you fucking Milanese prick! What the fuck are you doing? Are you crazy? Why do I have to do it? Weren't you the courageous one? - You faggot! - Piece of shit! Put your hands on me again. I'll show you how easy it is to blow a head off! Give me the gun! Enough with this crap! - What are they doing? - Scram. - Come on, touch me again. - I got an idea. We'll do what they do in war... ...to decide who goes on deadly missions. We each pick a match. - Where are you going? - Shhh! Spider with hair, and owl flying in the air... ...slimy slug and blind snake, our children do not take. Nighttime creatures, darkness seekers... ...you who only sleep when the sun gleams... ...watch over this boy in his dreams. Spider with hair, and owl flying in the air... ...slimy slug and blind snake, our children do not take. Nighttime creatures, darkness seekers... ...you who only sleep when the sun gleams... ...watch over this boy in his dreams. He discovered everything and the monster couldn't stop him... ...because he had powers. Who's there? Shut up, no one's there! Filippo! Filippo! Filippo, is that you? Filippo! Filippo! Wait, I'll take it off. Are you alright? Come on, let's go. Stand up. Stand up, I can't do it alone! Don't you understand? If you stay, they'll shoot you! I came to save you! Get up, stupid! What? I can't. What did you say? I can't. Sorry. No excuses, you've got to, understand? Come on, we're almost there. Come on, you're strong. Now climb up, I'll push you, but you have to climb up. Come on, you're doing great. Come on! Move it, they're coming! Come on! Come on! Good, now jump. I'm afraid. Jump, they're coming! You have to jump! Good. Good job. - Come on, I'll wait for you. - No, you have to go. Leave! Leave! Dad! Talk to me, Michele! Open your eyes! Michele! Look at me, don't be afraid. Open your eyes. Open your eyes, Michele. Look at me. Don't be afraid. Pino! He ran away! Talk to me, Michele. Talk to me. Hey! Hey! I'm sorry. I didn't know it was you. I didn't know it was you. Pino, I can't find him! He ran away! Don't worry about him, he's fine. The kid ran away! You have to kill that kid! You shot him instead of me. Good boy! I'm glad you came back. Come here. Come. Good boy! - I'M NOT SCARED -
