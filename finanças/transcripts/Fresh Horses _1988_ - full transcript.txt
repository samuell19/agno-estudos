And then there was something on the 12th. What was it? Something to do with... My brother’s graduation. Oh, right. Oh, yeah. I forgot. I know it sounds ridiculous, but I’m in the wedding party. My parents are not asking for a wedding. It would be just like no one would be able to come. So we’re hoping, at the end of June, but we plan to be... Should we lie? We don’t have to. Okay. Matt, what happened? Alice, the boat, you know how it is. It broke down again. Don’t you lie to me. Now get in here. May I? Thanks. Hello. Hey, Pats, how you doing? Looking good. I want you. You got me. Where’s your tie? Huh? Oh, no tie. Hey.Hey! How are you doing? It’s bachelorette number three, huh? I wanted you to meet our oldest and dearest friends, Dr. and Mrs. Oppenheimer. Oh.This is Sam. This is Lila. How do you do?Kyle and Jeannie Larkin, who will be, of course, Alice’s future in-laws. How nice. Look, look, all I was saying before was that it was unfair to me for you two... What? Does this look stupid?A little. It’s unfair to me for you two to get engaged. That’s all I’m saying.It was unfair to you? Mm-hmm. How does this make Maureen feel? Look at her. She’s ready to go now. She’s going to come at me. It’s your fault. Hi. Congratulations, guy. Thanks. Tipton. Fairgate. What a slob. If I had stayed with my last boyfriend, I wonder if we would have ended up with an engagement party like this and marriage and the whole thing? When I canned him, he said, "If you ever change your mind... ever..." I won’t, but... I thought it was a decent thing to say. Just born to be a heartbreaker, Ellen. Nothing you can do about it. I guess. Ladies and gentlemen. Ladies and gentlemen, your attention, please. Just a moment. To my daughter and to Matt, to their engagement, and may June come quickly. If the reflux ratio is decreased continuously, a second limiting condition is reached, at which the reflux ratio becomes a minimum. What would be the required number of plates at the condition of a minimum reflux ratio? Mr. Fletcher? Infinite. Thank you, Mr. Fletcher, but your ventriloquist won’t be there on exam day. Where will you be? Hi, Michelle. Mr. Burke, how are you, sir? How are you? Say, buddy, how’s it going? Say. Larkin, this is Sproles. Hi. Matt. O.W. Sproles took me to this house in the country last night. What house? What was that woman’s name again? Jean. Right. This woman named Jean lives there, has this constant party. Well, I don’t know if it’s constant... I talked to some guys who were there. They said it was like a perpetual house of party. What guys? I don’t know, just these guys. Her friends are some rough characters. That doesn’t bother us because... My brother’s an undercover cop. Nobody hassles us. What'd you do there? Uh, I don’t know. What did we do? We just hung. Yeah, yeah, my brother knows a lot of joints off the beaten... You know, track. Yeah, but listen, this one’s hip. I’m taking your ass over there tonight. I’m an engaged man, Tip, remember? Parties will never be the same. Come on, Larkin. Why would I want to go to some house in the country, anyway? Because...It’s outrageous, man. Yeah.I got too much to do. Matt... Matt, you work too hard, pal. Be like me. I don’t work. You know, some day, you’re a hotshot engineer, then work. Goodbye. Your next lucky number in this bingo game is O-75. 7-5, under the O. Well, I can’t believe that didn’t do it for somebody. Now, you got that lucky red dress on. You must be coming close, Sandra. N-41. That’s 4-1 under the N. Bingo! That’s the name of the game. Check that card, Suede, my very good friend, and remember, sports fans, don’t clear your cards until this race is announced... official. These people are older, Matt, but I like that. I feel comfortable around them, personally. I don’t think so. Am I going to spend the rest of my life with these people? I doubt that too, but it’s just that... well, who are we unless we sample a little of this, try a little of that, sample some more of this. I don’t know, who are we? It’s just that... That element, that... these people have lived a little. Okay, unsavory? I’m not going to say they’re not, but that can be appealing. Yeah. Absolutely. Unsavory's my favorite. I wasn’t going to tell you this, I was going to let you find out for yourself when you came out there. The night I was there with Sproles, I met this girl. She’s a friend of the woman who owns the place. Uh-huh. Hello.Hi, Ellen. Hello. May June come quickly. Anyway, I met this chick, and she’s... Well, she’s like, she loves me. She’s head over heels over me. Like you would go out on Maureen. Hey, Matt! I might. Come on, let’s go out there. You don’t have to move in. Okay, just watch me, all right? What are you going to do? Watch how I act. Watch how I make myself at home, all right? That’s what you do here. That’s how you act, okay? Okay? ♪ I done run into my baby ♪ And finally found My old blue jeans ♪ ♪ Well, I done Ran into my baby ♪ ♪ And finally found my old blue jeans ♪ You’re right. This is exciting. You want a beer?No. The kitchen’s that way. Get me a beer, would you? Sure, buddy. Thanks, pal. Hi. ♪ By the oil And the gasoline, yeah ♪ Good tune, huh? Excuse me. I didn’t mean to... I just came in here to... get, uh... Is this the refrigerator? Came in to get the refrigerator? Huh? No. Tipton wanted, uh, a beer, actually, is what he wanted. Would you mind if I had a... could I have a sip of your soda? Oh, I’m sorry. Kid, no spitting. Sorry. It’s bourbon. I was kidding. God. My name’s Jean. What’s your name? Matt Larkin. Matt... Can I make you a bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwich, Matt? No thanks. Thank you, no. So you going to be coming around or... Uh, maybe. I don’t know, maybe, yeah. I think you just got to come around some. You live here? No. No, I don’t either. I know you don’t. Supposed to be a lot of fun here. Well, Jean likes to have people around. It makes her happy. You in school? No. I thought just maybe we went to college together and just didn’t know it, you know? Yeah...but no. Yeah, I just came here because my friend, Tipton, he heard about this place at school. I just run over here from my house next door because my step-daddy come home with that breath of his and climbed into my bed and laid down and put his arm around me. Jesus. Yeah. What the hell were you doing in bed at 11:00 in the morning? I was tired, okay? I already had two classes. Oh, good for you. I’m really sorry I spit on you. Didn’t bother me. Thanks anyway...pal. Uh...aren’t you going to introduce me? Jewel, it’s for you, honey. It’s Jewel. Hello. No, I can’t talk now. I can’t talk now because I’m busy. If your step-father gives you a hard time, maybe you could tell your boyfriend. Maybe he could help you out. That wasn’t my step-father, and I don’t have a boyfriend. Say... Say. What the hell are you doing? My dad wants to sell her. No! Yep. Cathy! I told him wait till spring, I’ll clean her up, he gets twice as much, and we split it. What, you get half? Yeah.It’s too much work, pal. I don’t mind. Look, Maureen and I are going to be over at her place tonight. Why don’t you and Alice show up, huh? I thought maybe we’d go back out to that house, you and me. No, I’d rather see Maureen, wouldn’t you? I mean, Alice. What did you think of that girl I met out there? Trouble. Why do you say that? You asked me what I thought. Come on, Larkin, I didn’t take you out there to meet some, you know... Some what?Some... I don’t know, whatever... Whatever she is... Here, make yourself useful, huh? Oh, no, I can’t. Sorry. I got to... I got a class. On Sunday? Yeah, it’s some, uh, medieval religious heretic seminar. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye Cathy. Cold? No. You? Fine. Good. Let’s see. You live, um... Yeah, that way. Are you from this area? No. What’s the matter? Nothing. No. Nothing. It’s just... Where are you from? Well, Florida’s where I was born. Oh... I love Florida. Brothers or sisters? No. I think my step-daddy’s got a kid somewheres, but I never seen him. What’s this place? It used to be a railroad repair place a long time ago. There’s still some of them standing. Come on, I’ll show you. I come here sometimes. To do what? Just to get away. You know, I can read your future with 32 ordinary playing cards. Thirty-two? Yeah. Ace down through seven. All four suits. Or even 18. Twelve court cards, four aces and two jokers. How'd you learn to do that? It’s been passed on down to me. Shoot, I even got my name from the cards. The name Jewel? It comes from the ruby in the crown of the Queen of Clubs. Why didn’t they just call you Ruby? What’s the two of hearts mean? Good fortune. Success. Good. Good thing it wasn’t the two of diamonds, though, because that means a bad love affair, friends and relatives against you. This could be good, but there’s no cards on either side of it, so I don’t know... but I got a feeling. You get feelings sometimes, don’t you? Oh, yeah. I get feelings. Then believe mine. And sometimes I can go through a whole deck of cards and tell which ones are red and which ones are black. From the back? Yeah. How do you do that? I do it by heat. Can we go now? I’m telling you, this is true. They open the guy, right, and they find the surgeon's magnifying goggles in his stomach with nothing there from, like, the last operation. No, no, I’m telling you, this happens in hospitals every day. Listen, Alice, has your father ever operated on a guy’s spine, after the operation, the guy can’t walk? God... I don’t think so.You have any sense at all? Well, is it important to you that I do? Yeah. Did I offend you? No. See?You have to work tomorrow night? Hand me that extra knife. You know I do.That one. Can't we skip the game and maybe just be alone tonight? We're here, Alice. I know, we've got the rest of our lives and everything, but... Is this like the crystal you were talking about? See, it’s simple and elegant. I love that. Okay, five bucks, and you give me three points.Please? Five bucks, and you give me six points.Sure. Deal? Done. You’re a sucker. You’re such a sucker. I’ll tell you why. First of all, the guy can’t throw a long ball. He can’t run. Can he run? No. All right, he can run, but he drops the ball. Oh, you've got to see the China I picked out today. You'll die. Putting it in a house? Well, apartment. Until we start a family. Then I got to have a house. I mean, you're a sucker, Matt. You’re just a sucker. Yeah? So, what have you got to say for yourself? Nothing. Nothing? You have nothing to say for yourself? Yes, I did. This is my fault. Well, I’m thanking you for it. N-32! Three-two under the N. I just don’t know if I’m going to allow it. Hey, look, you don’t have anything to say about it. B-8, my friends! B number-eight. All right, maybe I don’t have anything to say about it. Fine. That doesn't mean I’m going to allow it. Look, I have to do it, all right? My best friend’s a raving lunatic. How do you think that makes me feel? Huh? I’m not a lunatic. See? The insane don’t know they’re insane. They don’t even realize it. They have no thought. No idea. No awareness. Tsk-tsk... Call the damn numbers. Uh...G-48, my friends. Four-eight. Four-eight. No! Alice! Matt! What’s going on? Alice! Alice! What have you done to her? Alice! Alice, come on, now. Alice? Alice! Get away! Get away! ...I’d come home from school, and I’d cry... lunch time, because I didn’t want to go back, and my mother would wipe away my tears. I’d say, "Mom, do I look like I’ve been crying?" She’d say, "No, no, not at all." I’d go outside and meet Tipton on the sidewalk, and he’d go, "Matt, are you all right? Look like you've been crying." Every day. You poor thing. When was that? Uh, I guess I was a sophomore in college. I was in the third grade. Careful. What’s this for? Thank you. You ever wonder who designs these things? No. My parents used to bring me and my brother here all the time when we were little. Yeah? I used to ask my dad where these rides came from. How they got here. I don’t know who does that. He didn’t either. I should show you some of my designs sometime. Some of the things I’ve built. I wish you would. My favorite one, though, is this three-dimensional board game I designed. Yeah. I could never do anything like that, I guess. Although, you know, I’m good in arithmetic. How old are you?Twenty. Really? Mm-hmm. There is something I ought to tell you, though. Okay. Um... it’s just that I never graduated from high school. What? I said I never graduated from high school. I suspected that. You did? Uh-huh. You see, we were all the time moving around from place to place, and finally I quit getting re-signed up and everything. You know, I almost did, but then I didn’t. You will one of these days.Oh, I know I will. I mean, it is important that you do, but, you know, no rush. Oh, I can’t see you tonight.Why not? Well, I got to go to Lexington with my mother to see my grandmother. She’s sick. What? Oh, it just sounds...peculiar. Why? Everybody always uses their grandmother as an excuse. Oh, I didn’t know that. Oh, yeah. I know guys, six, seven dead grandmothers all over the country. What’s up? What? Hold it. What are you doing? Um, you hungry? I guess so.All right, park it. It’s just, all I’m saying is, that certain people just... I mean, treachery and lies and... You know? For example, I now have something to tell you about Jewel, and I really think you’d better believe it, pal. I’m not going to talk about Jewel. Larkin, look, if Jewel is such a touchy thing with you, maybe you should think about that. Every time you talk about Jewel, you make it clear you lust for her. Oh, hey.Hey. No. No, just hang a minute, all right? Jewel is married. What? Yes, she’s married. Jewel’s married. She’s a married woman? Yeah. Well, huh... that’s the other thing. What? She’s not a woman. I mean, she’s not... She’s not 20. She’s 16 years old. She’s a girl. She is 20 years old. No, she’s 16 years old, and she’s married. Who told you that? Are you still hungry?Who told you that? Uh, Sproles. Excuse me, miss? Hi. Can we get some more sliders and spikes to go? Sure.Thank you. She’s very cute. Look, if she’s married, where’s her husband? Because I see her every night. Every night? Almost. Uh, apparently, he used to be in the Navy. Maybe... He’s in the Navy? All right, I don’t know. Okay? But would you just, like, maybe consider listening to somebody besides Jewel sometime? Who? Sproles? I don’t think so. Just consider the possibility that you're being lead down some little path here. Whether it’s true or not, it doesn't matter, because I’m crazy about her. You’re not crazy about her. I am. No, you think you are. You tell me the difference. It’d be nice to see you around campus again. Okay, you got king, queen, king, queen, boy, girl... God... What does it mean? I don’t know if I know yet. I mean, this is your future, here. This is a very sexy deck. Okay, let me start with you. You’re the nine of clubs right here. Uh-huh.And the five of clubs is... Hi, there. Morning, Matt. I’ll tell you what they mean later, okay? Excuse me. You know what we’re going to talk about? No, what? How come you're such good friends with Laurel? Well, she’s Jean’s daughter. She’s...15 years old? You think I could be friends with someone 15 or 16? Look, let’s just not talk about people in their own home, okay? Is there something bugging you about me? I don’t know, maybe. Can I see your driver’s license? No, I lost my driver’s license. Where? At your grandma’s? No. Somebody bumped into me... Me driving my Mama’s car... And of course everybody blamed me, and Mama just took my license away. How old are you? How old are you? I’m not 16 years old if that’s what you heard. What? What else do you want to know? I want to know if you're married. You don’t think I’m smart enough to be going out with, do you? No, just smart enough for you, because that crack you just made about my high school. Will you stop evading me? You only want to believe other people. You make me believe you! You want to know if I’m married? Yeah. Yes! I’m married, okay? I married a guy! Now you know! I’m sorry. I was desperate. I was afraid you wouldn’t have nothing to do with me if you knew I was married. Is that what you thought?Yes. Good thinking. The marriage don’t hardly exist. I never had sex with him. You never had sex with him? Am I supposed to believe that? You’ve got to believe that. I was too scared. I hate Green. I hate the guy. Thing is, you married him. But that was just to get out of my house, away from that stepfather my mama married. How did I know that we’d move in with Green’s father, and he’d turn out to be the same way? What are we supposed to do with each other with you married? Why don’t you come in with me? No, please let me wait here. Good evening. What? Christ, Larkin! It’s just you know, would it be too much to ask if... You know, huh? I had no idea you were so rude. You didn’t? No. Just, you know, walk in, why don’t you, huh? You’ve a cousin who’s a lawyer, don’t you? Yeah, Gary. Why? I need a lawyer. For what? An annulment. An annulment? What are you, nuts? Will you take me to him? Larkin, why don’t you just sleep on this, all right? In the morning if you still want to do it... Screw the morning. Tonight. It’s 11:00. Are you going to help me or not? You know, Maureen, you don’t have to change the bedding. I have to change the bedding, thank you. Maureen’s the cleanest person I’ve ever seen. The Mayo Clinic’s not that clean. She is immaculate. She smokes a lot of cigarettes, doesn't she? You’d never know it. I swear to God, you could not in any way tell. Not even while she’s smoking. How does she do that? She has an ashtray beside her, and she flicks the ash. The next second you look, the ashtray, it’s perfectly clean. She’s the most neurotic person on earth. Don’t say that. who you're complaining about, Matt? Who? Maureen. No, you're not. That’s not who you're complaining about...pal. Means you make the marriage null and void. Yeah, I know, I know that. I’m sorry. That’s what we have to do. So you have to dig up something. Maybe something he lied about before they were married. Epilepsy in the family he didn’t tell her about. Some kind of bullshit like that, or maybe this cat would simply agree to an annulment. In which case, everybody just lies, and we get some bozo judge to toss the marriage out the window. She never had sex with him. It’s true. What... What’s this girl’s religion? Is she some kind of Catholic? I got to go to the pope with this thing? I don’t know. I never asked her. Well, forget about it. Who cares? Leave it to me. Okay, so, Gary, what’s this... What’s this going to set him back? 500 bucks? Hey, the initial consultation’s free. Look, when the horse underneath us drops, we take a fresh one. Look, why don’t you just take a hike on this nag...? This has got nothing to do with you! I’m sorry. What happened in there? Nothing. Forget it. Where are we going? Home. I wish I could meet your parents. Oh, some other time. Come on. It smells like you in here. I always imagined what your room would look like. I guess I didn’t imagine too good. Who’s she? I gave her up for you. She’s pretty. Well, that’s the way I like them. What’s her name? It doesn't matter.What’s her name? Jewel...What is her name? It doesn't matter.What is her name? Will you be quiet? Alice is her name. What the hell’s wrong with you?Her. I bring you here to show you what I’m interested in. What I’m thinking about. You don’t care. I don’t know anything about designing things or science or anything like that. You ought to start learning a thing or two. What you and I do is thrilling, but it’s not the only thrill, kiddo. Call me kiddo, college man.Keep your voice down... Why’d you bring me here if you're ashamed? I’m not... What?I don’t belong to some sorority girls club.Shh! What? I don’t want to be here any more than you want me. Why’d you bring me here?I want you here. Why don’t you bring me in the daytime, instead in the middle of the night like somebody’s whore! Hey, how come you don’t never wear that thing? What? That. No reason. No? No. Well, when I was little, I was so skinny, my wrist would... Was so tiny, I couldn’t get a wristband around it, or if there was a band, the watch would hang over both... Both sides of my wrist. Don’t tell anybody I told you that, okay? I won’t. Just never got used to wearing one. Tell me more things like that. Tell me everything about you. No. Do you want to go to Jean’s house? No. You spend too much time over there. Most times I’m over there waiting for you to come out there to see me. Those people that hang out there, her crowd, they could be anybody. You be real jealous, okay? Who said anything about being jealous? Jealousy is a base emotion. The what? It’s contemptible. It’s... It’s bad. Well, I’m the jealous type myself. Well...it’s base. Okay. We don’t have to go over there then. I don’t mean to say that you can’t go... I said, okay! He still giving you a hard time? Who? Who? Your stepfather. Oh, no. You’d tell me if he was, wouldn’t you? Yeah. You sure? Yeah. Good. Give me a coffee. Here you go, sugar. And listen, anybody can go to some off-campus bar... maybe a fancy restaurant... You drop $22.95 on a blackened steak and asparagus. Hey, O.W., how you doing? Hey, good. How are you? Naw. Naw, I like a place that’s a little different, you know? I’d rather bring a six-pack of beer over here, maybe a sack of White Castles and put my feet up, you know? Oh, baby, don’t you have some school work? No. Well, pretend like you do, baby. Hey, Matt, water hot enough?Oh, yeah, fine. Tough living without a bathroom, isn’t it? Yeah, you never get used to it, I guess. Oh, and Jewel went over to her mama’s. She’ll be back in an hour. All right. It’s my bet. I’ll bet five. Hey, you don’t need any money, do you? Matter of fact, I do. I can give you about 50 bucks for that little redheaded number of yours. Hey, don’t walk away from me... Yeah, it’s tough living here too, boy! Come here, faggot. Roy! Roy, what are you doing? This is it, Roy! I never want to see your face again. And take your drummer boy with you. What this now, you want me to leave here for good? That’s exactly right. It almost sounds like she means it. Yeah, it almost does. You damn right, I mean it. Now, get the hell out of here, both of you. This guy goes to a... A used car lot, and he sees a salesman, and he goes over to the salesman and the salesman says, "Can I help you, sir?" The guy says, "Yeah, I’m looking for a new car." The salesman looks, and he says, uh, "Is that your wife sitting there in the car? Looks pretty good to me." Hi, there. Hi. You look awful lonesome sitting there. They fought over me. I know they did. Me and Matt... You ever had an experience like this? No. I wish I could have had an experience like that. Just one. You’ve had lots of experiences, Jean. Yeah... and I wish I could forget every one of them. I left some water for you on the window sill. Thank you. Jean? Uh-huh. Why didn’t you warn me? Honey, I had no idea he was going to do anything like that... No, about her. Why didn’t you warn me about her? Get some sleep now. Say... Say. Matt, you remember Sproles. Sproles... How goes it? Larkin, I got to tell you something. Uh, pardon me. This is my friend, Jane. She’s in my criminal law class. Hi, Jane. How are you? You got to hear this. Go ahead. Sproles knows this guy, um, what’s his name? Green. Right, this guy, Green, and-and-and he knows his wife, Jewel. So... Uh, allow me. First of all, Green is scum, okay? Now, he’s the kind of scum, he’s, uh, 10, 12 years old, he tells his friends to steal money from their mother’s pocketbooks and then when his mother’s getting dressed, he charges his friends outside her window to watch. So what? It’s got nothing to do with Jewel. But this is the guy she had to have so bad she married him. This Green character, my brother says he may have murdered two different people. Sproles' brother’s undercover. You said. Listen to him, please. He’s a fifth-year senior. Now, Jewel, well... Jewel is just a... Look, without that body built the way she is, nobody would go near her, and she’s what? She’s 16 years old?That’s not true. Yeah, right. Do you realize I know all about you? How you met her over at Jean’s. Your little love-hutch. I even know about the night at the side of the house. I don’t know how you or anybody else would know about that. How could I know? Ask yourself. Jewel told you? No, that, uh, what’s her name? Um, Laurel. She told me. Look, she’s like, uh, what’s that word? Manipulating you, like, uh... Putty. Yeah. Listen, you don’t have to marry every teenage girl that catches your eye. Especially if she’s already married to somebody else... Who said anything about marrying her? Okay, I told Sproles you might. She sees a chance in you, that’s all. You got breeding. I don’t have breeding.I know. But compared to her you do. This is a girl who lies to you, Larkin. Thank you. Your friend is, uh...Just shut up. Oh, I missed a class. Tell me about it. No, I hate missing General Health. General Health? What the hell are you doing taking General Health? I didn’t take it when I was a freshman, when it was required. Now, I take it, or I don’t graduate. That’s humiliating, huh? Well, actually, the good thing is the girls. You’re surrounded by all these, well, smart, healthy, frisky, freshmen animals. They idolize you, you know? It’s like being in a corral with these wild ponies. It sounds good. Yeah, it is good. Leta’s go out. Where? Follow me. What, girls? What do you think? I think I like your style, Larkin. Because you know, I’m not going to wake up someday saddled to some mistake, and you're not either. You know what I don’t get? How your dad made so much money so fast. It wasn’t so fast. Look, I think about this country and economics and having a little bit of self-go-get-'em, and I can’t understand why everyone, say, over the age of 32, everybody doesn't want to be incredibly wealthy.

Have you heard this or not?No. Listen, listen, all right, here it is, okay? This guy walks into a psychiatrist’s office, all right, and... With a parrot on his shoulder, okay? And-and-and he says, um, the psychiatrist says, "Yes, sir, how can I help you?" And the... The parrot says... "Get this guy off my feet." You’ve heard this joke? How come you guys got so many schmellows? I didn’t get it. You don’t get it?Yeah, I don’t get it. Why don’t you amble over here by the fire, and I’ll explain it to you. Gross. How come we dragged ourselves out here? She likes you.I guess so. I mean it. I’m sorry. I do not feel dragged. How did you guys know about this place? This place is a dive.What are you talking about? This place is great.It’s horrible. Us? Huh? How do we know about this place? Uh, we... We come hunting here sometimes. Come on, you guys. Yes. We come hunting. What do you hunt?What do you hunt? We hunt with a crossbow. We hunt wild geese and wild boar. Wild boar? Yeah. Wild boar? Is that... Is that where you found Alice? Ooh! I bet you and Alice come here all the time. Is this your little love nest?Come on. I was seeing a married woman, and we used to come here. I don’t think that’s funny. That is so funny. That is... I mean, this guy, you joke and you joke. Mister Rebound. No, I think he’s not kidding. Of course he’s kidding. What are you, bobo? Come on, he’s kidding.Hey! You were serious with a married person? You don’t get serious over a married person. You just... You... You have fun with her. Wait a minute. Are you in a problem with this married person and we’re here to mend your bruised heart? Did you have fun with her? No, this is not true. Because we’re not like a bunch of desperate old housewives that just need to escape out someplace and get laid. Wait! Who said anything about getting laid yet? Uh, I... You know something guys don’t realize? Move. Don’t throw that at me. They don’t realize that we consider ourselves lucky when we get laid. No, no, you see, you're wrong there. We consider you very lucky when you get laid. Oh, come on, back me up on this. That is... That is really rude and vile. Now I’m trying to make an important point, I believe.Yes, yes, men and women are very similar. Oh, yes, we’re so similar. Yes, but the difference is, with guys... No, with guys... That’s dumb.What, sex? Oh, please. Look at me. I like women for their minds. Oh, come on, guys. And their intelligence. You loved my mind in the pool, babe. Yeah, well, not your mind. Women... Women are so special. I know where your mind is. Absolutely juvenile. Juvenile? You know what your problem is? Who are you all? Who are you? I got to go meet somebody. Anybody got a cigarette? Mind if I flop a minute? When I was a little baby about less than a year old, people in my family used to give me cigarettes to smoke. When you were how old? Just a little baby. They used to hold lit cigarettes up to me, the ones they were smoking, and I just draw on them like they was a bottle of milk. I’ve been smoking since I was less than a year old. I’ve been addicted that long. God, the things they can find to do to you. And, like, take, like, there was this family on this lookout mountain, way high up, and this little girl’s momma picks her up by under the arms and makes her look all the way down, maybe two whole miles, and this little girl’s dangling over the wall, screaming her lungs out, and the mama’s saying, "Look, look, little baby, you can see seven states." You do that to a little child, and you can scar her brain for life. Crazy fucking things happen to you. Can I see you outside a minute? Some kind of mess, isn’t it? You get the money? Yeah, I got it. Thanks. Did you come out here with these people just to hurt me? It worked. Why have you left me? I haven’t. I just tried to. I need to borrow your car to go meet Green. You want to borrow my car... Please. I have to go meet him to talk about the annulment. Be careful. Come back soon. I will. He would scare him to death, and he forgot it was... Oh, he’s back. Is the night ruined? What does everybody think? I don’t think anything has to be ruined. Can I talk to you for a sec? Jeez, man, I don’t know, maybe I ought to kick your ass, huh? Huh? Huh? We got these highly attractive women out here. We bring them out here, right, and what do you do? I mean, you let Jewel come in and act up right in the middle of everything. It’s... I mean, look, look at me. I’m busting my ass trying to straighten you out. I don’t know why I bother. Don’t bother. Yeah, I’ll tell you why I bother. Because when you become our age, it... It gets harder and harder, you know, to... To make friends, all right... and if you find someone who you like, or you have someone you like for some reason... I say, okay, you fight to keep him. So I will, okay? But just... come on, come on, just don’t push me to the limit on this thing. This isn’t the only place in the world. Leta’s go to a spot. Look, these are... These are wonderful girls, here. I can’t go. Listen, I don’t want to take sides, but... I can’t go. Okay. Fine. Come on. Leta’s go. Hello? Jean? Hey. Hey. She’s at her mother’s house. Thanks. Matt... Yeah? Wish you well. You too, Jean. Okay, what happened? Why couldn’t you come back last night? You'll hate me if I tell you. I won’t hate you. I can’t hate you. I drove out, and I met Green at the Blue Devil. The Blue Devil? That’s where he told me to go meet him. I had to if I want him to go along with the annulment. Why didn’t you tell me you were going there? I would have gone with you. You didn’t ask me. I met him out in front, where he was standing there with a couple of other guys, and he come over to my car... He came over. He didn’t come over. It already happened. He came o... Then what? He wanted me to get in the back seat with him, and I said no, and I tried to start up the car to leave, but the car wouldn’t start. It just wouldn’t start.I know, I know. Go on. So then he made me get in the backseat with him. He said just to talk. So I give him these papers that this lawyer guy gives for him to sign, but he wouldn’t sign it. By then, a bunch of these other guys had started gathering around, and some of them got in with us, and one of them was Green’s old man, he was there. He’s even more awful than my stepfather ever was... and then they all started grabbing me and touching me, or trying to, because I was struggling, and then Green made them stop, and I thought he was going to protect me, but I should have known better. He told them that he would show me off for money from them. So they all started paying him. And one of them would hold me down, and Green would pull up my shirt and my bra and show me off to one or two of them, and then some of them would get out, and then others would get in and the same thing, and the windows were getting all fogged up, and I was getting dizzy and shaken and bruised, and I couldn’t even struggle anymore or think straight, and every one of them was just laughing and slapping each other around and passing liquor... and then I don’t remember what happened after that. Are you telling me you were raped in the back of my car? I don’t know.Of course you know. I said I’m only clear about it as much as I told you. How long did this go on? It seemed like a very long time. If you were assaulted, we got to do something about it. No. I went through it, and it’s over. It’s done with, and I want to forget about it. I passed out. I must have passed out, because I woke up this morning with my clothes every which-a-way and I just straightened myself up, and I come right here. Did you recognize anybody besides Green and his old man? Yeah, one. That friend of Tipton's was there. Who?Um... Sproles. That guy Sproles was there. He paid his money to see me, I swear it. Is everybody going to have a different story, Jewel? Will you let me take you to a doctor? No. You... You’re sick! Hey, hey, hey, Larkin!Last night. No... Oh, no, no, no, you don’t understand. I was there, but I just happened to be there. I wasn’t... I... I had nothing to do with it. Look, I was a bystander. Hey... Look, Jewel parked in the front of the drive-in, see, and Green, he’s there with a bunch of guys in... Shooting craps in the back of his truck. He... He’s got a fistful of money. He comes over, gets in the car with Jewel and starts trying to fool around with her. He was showing her off. No! That’s the way she tells it. She’s being exhibited. Well, no, maybe she perceived it that way. I don’t know. See, the money Green had in his hands, maybe she perceived it was payment to look at her. Maybe that’s why she was fighting. How did you just so happen to be at the Blue Devil, Sproles? I was there with my brother. He’s an undercover cop, for chrissakes. Look, he came out front to see what was going on, and he sent the guys on their way. Now, if Jewel were being mistreated back there, Larkin, by those thugs, he would’ve arrested the whole bunch. Now I’m telling you the truth. You can ask my brother. Look, I’m not saying Jewel was lying to you. She was hysterical. She, uh, maybe she got panicky. She... What do you call it, um, misinterpreted what was going on. Do you know where Green lives? Huh? Yeah. No, look, I have a class. My brother’s going to get the guy eventually, Matt, for all kinds of stuff. Why don’t you just leave him to my brother, hmm? Look, I don’t have to go in there, do I? I mean, there’s nothing I can... Take off, Sproles. Well now... you just came right on in, didn’t you? I knocked. Well, I’m not going to worry about it. Business good? Working myself to death. What is this? You’re not very good at this. This supposed to be an animal? Didn’t exactly bring it to life, did you? Just kind of take a bar of Life-boy and hack the thing up? Maybe I ought to wash your mouth out with it. You want to do that? You want to wash my mouth out with it? Why are you here? I think she likes it here. I don’t think so. What are you doing here? You gonna be the prince, is that it? You’re gonna carry her off on a big white horse? No. I’m nobody’s prince. Well, I think she’s expecting you to give her everything. Haven’t you led her to believe that you would? I can’t. I can’t do that. So you're here to bail out tonight. Right? I mean, if you ain’t gonna just sweep her away, well, you're bailing out. Ain’t no in-between here, son. Well, maybe there is. Maybe you would sleep a lot better, now, knowing she’d been...released. I’d sleep a lot better knowing she never had to see you again. But you're too good for her, is that it? I ain’t good enough, but you're too fucking good. Why’d you have to come out here? I want everyone to stop hurting you. Jesus Christ... You want me to leave? Yes. I wouldn’t go nowhere just yet, son. I gotta decide what to do with you. I’m taking you with me. I’m not leaving you here. Hold on! Let him go! Oh, now she’s going to get into it. Watch this. This'll be good. Boy, she’s one bag of tricks, ain’t she? Between you and me, reach in, don’t know what you might get. I tell you, one time I come home, she’s got some kind of black magic going on. Had them goddamn cards spread all over the floor. Candles burning all over the house. Frightening scene. Honey, what was it you was trying to find in the cards that night? Your future? Will you let me take you home, please? Just stay away from me! I want you to get out of here! I never want to see you again, ever! Jewel... Go, go! And let him go! Don’t you dare try to stop him! Sign the papers, or don’t sign them. I don’t care, because you're dead to me anyway. You’re dead to me! Yeah, I’m going all right, but I’m going by myself. Don’t talk about me. Don’t even think about me. Just do me that favor. You don’t want me. I’m used. I’m worn-out. I’m bad goods. You can’t trust me. Why don’t I just go to hell? You think I’m a dope? Well, let me tell you something. Deep down, I’ve always been smart enough to know this wouldn’t last. You got one thing with me, just one thing... Sex with me... Jewel, that is not all that we ever had. Shut up. I heard the truth. I heard you. Grab my hand, grab my hand! Hang on! Watch it! Ah, body block! So, you're making the old Tiptop go back to school, huh? I want him to get his master’s. Yeah, and I tell her, half of the people who work in Kings Island have their master’s in history, but, you know, what can it hurt, right? Right. Here, let me get these things. I’ll meet you guys up there, okay? Order me a hot chocolate, all right? Laurel, hi. Hi, Matt. How are you? Good. I’m... I’m good. How are you? How’s... How’s your mother? She’s fine. We sold the house. We moved into an apartment. How’s it up in the north? Oh, it’s fine. It’s not too bad. You here alone? No... Hi. Hi. Hey, Matt, this is Steven. Hi. It’s a pleasure. Same here. Steven, do you want to help me with the skates? Yeah, sure. I enjoyed meeting you. Yeah. Nice meeting you. I wondered if you’d be home for the holidays. Oh, you knew I went away? Sure, I knew. How’s that graduate school? Oh, school? You know, it never ends. No, I don’t guess it ever does. No. Thank you. Steven seems like a good... A good guy. He is. He’s awful nice. He’s in my English class. Oh, good. I was hoping that you’d... go back... I did. I’m in Laurel’s school. Laurel’s grown up a little bit. A year’s worth. It’s funny. In some ways, I remember her very clearly, and in other ways... I think the mind has a natural way of letting go, doesn't it? I guess so. I have to go, Matt. Thank you.
