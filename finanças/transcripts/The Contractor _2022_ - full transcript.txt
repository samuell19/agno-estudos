In the church, we often don't know how to relate to friends or... or family members who are struggling. That means a lot of people, even in our church, feel really alone. So let's show them our love and send these boys off in the embrace of God's love. Joe Lee, Michael Randolph and Benjamin Ellis. Come on. Yeah. That's right. Gentlemen, please join me up here on stage. We pray, dear Lord, for those that wield the swords so that... that righteousness may triumph and wrongdoings may be vanquished. For these men are our protectors. Lord, please comfort their families while these men are deployed. Bestow special grace upon all these children. May God bless you and protect you. And may God bless America. Amen. Amen. Sorry. I didn't want to wake you up. That's all right. I was already awake. How's training going? Do we have time for night sex or no? I think he's awake. Doesn't he have school today? No, it's Saturday. Aren't they in school on Saturdays? Not since 1953. I liked 1953 a lot. It's a great year. Want to say hi to Dad? Hi. - Hey, Dad. - What you got there? Oh, look at that. - That's you in the airplane. - Mm-hmm. And those are the clouds. He's been working on that all week for you. That's incredible. Give us a hand. Okay. Come on. - Jack? Jack? - I'm right behind you, Dad. - Jack? Jack? - Dad, I'm right here. Come on. You got this. I believe in you. I'm gonna be right here, okay? If you need anything, I'm gonna be right here. All right. You ready? - No. - Yeah, you are. No. Please don't leave me. I'm not leaving you. I'm right here. Jack, look at me. Three... two... one.

You're swimming. Come on! You did good, son. Mom! I did it! - Yeah, you did. - I did it! Dad, I think I can swim now. Look. Again! Look at that. An inch in seven months. An inch in seven months. How about that? - Is that enough? - That's a lot. That's perfect. Hi, this is Sheila from Bills Recovery. I just wanna check in with y'all on your past due paym... Message deleted. Hey, James. Listen, man, I'm sorry to ruin your weekend, but the CO is testing the whole team. Uh, you better get down here. Army Sergeant First Class James Harper. At ease, Sergeant. This is our new CO, Lieutenant Colonel Roberts. Knee was shredded. Again. - Great job with the rehab. - Thank you, sir. Your lung precludes high altitude or underwater operations. I've done four combat rotations in five years with that lung, sir. You can relax, Sergeant Harper. Blood work came back filthy with Stanozolol, Nandrolone, phenylpropionate and HGH. You're an SOF medical sergeant. Should have known better. I wanted to stay on the team, sir. I wanted to stay on the team. I have no idea what your previous COs encouraged, but I won't accept that in my unit. Big Army recommended a revocation of your Special Forces tab. And although I disagree with your choices, I'm not going to do that. You're leaving the army with an honorable discharge, but you're losing your benefits, which include your pension and health care. Dismissed. James. - You don't have to say anything. - Look. They're cleaning house. - You made it easy for them. - I'll own up. I understand. With your rep, every private's gonna be hitting on you the second you walk off post. I took shit for my knee. They found it in my blood. That's what it was. So that's it? And there's nothing you can do? Mm-mmm. So, they just basically made up a new bullshit rule... - They didn't make up a... - Test... No, they didn't make up any bullshit. You said they haven't tested anybody in years. They haven't tested anyone in years. But it's legal. It's the new CO that has a fucking hard-on for just... I don't know, he just wants to clear house. That's what the captain told me. They wanna clear house. What's this? It's, um, debt collectors. But I already talked to them. And, uh, they said they could help us with a plan. What's the interest rate on it? It's 18%. Yeah. There is... There's real work out there with real money. - Private contracting? - Yeah. - Mm-mmm. - Why not? No. You said you weren't gonna do that... I know what I said. I know what I said. No. Mm-mmm. I love you. This is Bruce Michaels with Executive Protection. Congrats on your years of decorated service. We'd love to discuss opportunities. Mr. Harper, my name is David. I'm calling from the Department of Water and Power. Message deleted. What are you doing? Just putting up some shingles before... before we get weather. Where's our son? Oh, he's asleep. He's down for the count. Took him a bit, but... How was, uh... How was school? - Can you come down? - Yeah, I'll come down in a second. I just have a couple more to do. Honey, I got something to tell you. - I'll be down in a minute. - No. Like, now. I'll be down in a minute, Brianne. Mason's gone. What? Mason. He's gone. I... I just talked to Suzanne. How? How do you think? - When's the funeral? - It's tomorrow. Maybe we should call your mom and see if she can take Jack. I'm not gonna go. Of course we're gonna go, Brianne. No, I'm not gonna go. 'Cause I can't go to another one. What are you doing? - What? - What are you doing on the roof in the middle of the night? I'm fixing the roof. I'm okay. I'm just... That's exactly what Mason said to Suzanne. I'm really fucking scared. I'm not my father. He would've hated this. The ceremony or dying? Just being fat and ugly. How do you figure they shoved his giant butt into that grave? He's wearing a thong. How'd he do it? What do you mean? He died in his sleep. The family get full payout? Full payout. That's good. - Why don't you come over for dinner? - No. You haven't seen the new house. You're coming to dinner. You're as moody as he was fat. - Fuck you. - Fuck you. Yeah. Good to see you. Glad you're here. Appreciate it. You have a beautiful home. Hey, bud. How's it going? You wanna play a video game? When do I... When do I not wanna play a video game? Look at this. - Hey. - The White Sox. - Yeah. - Nice. - I love the White Sox. - Yeah. Apparently. - What? I like the White Sox. - Hey, Kelly. Hi, Uncle James. You got that? You gonna give me a tour, or should I just get a map? I guess so. Watch this. Yeah? Well, watch this. - Really good arm. - Roger Clemens over here. Thank you for this meal and thank you for bringing Uncle James back safely. Amen. - Amen. - Amen. Who was a better soldier, you or my dad? Well, uh, your dad was my chief, so... Careful. I was his superior. - Oh. - But we were, uh... How would you say? We looked after each other. Oh, kinda like brothers. Yeah, kinda like brothers. Uh... Is it true you actually saved my dad's life? No. Yes. Once. He pulled me out of a bar once. Yeah, he was a wreck. Your father was an absolute wreck. I hate to break it to you this early. - I... No. - Bummer. Well, uh, Mikey loves baseball. He'll never play. He's fighting it. He's... No quit in his DNA. There's no beating it. Well, best case, he'll need special care for the rest of his life. How are you doing? Good. Yeah, good. - Yeah. - You? Yeah, good. I mean, sure. You don't fall off the grid for two months if you're good. What's up? What do you look forward to? Watching my kids grow up. Seeing 'em smile. Making sure they're set. Giving them the things I didn't have. I gotta get my shit straight. There's help. No. Kill any operational future? No, not a chance. Privates contacted me. - Good. - Yeah. Yeah. No, fuck yeah. You deserve a paycheck. - Bank is on my ass, and I just... - Hell yeah. Take it. I pulled a couple of cowboy tours. You know, banked some decent cash, put a down payment on the house. Cash is real. You know, five, six a day. Bonuses, you know, it adds up. It's okay to cash in. You know, it's pure fuckin' Darwin out here. And we are trained to be ruthlessly adaptable. Use it. We're all just mercenaries in the end. So what do you got going now? Is it JSOC? Agency? Uh, in between. It doesn't pay as good as private, but it's legit NatSec work. He's one of us. Good people. Rock-solid. How much? Oh, 350. Can you get me in? Fucking hero? President shook your hand. Fuck off. He shakes a lot of hands. They pulled my clearances because of blood work. At this level, as long as you're good to go, Rusty doesn't care what you put in your body. I'm in. - Is that what you want? - That's what I want. I'm broke, Mike. I need this. I'll send your name up. Yeah. All right. I'll set up a meet. Yeah. Thanks. Of course. - What's up, fellas? - Hey, man. This is James, old running mate of mine. Where is he? You know where he's at. Why don't you give us a hand every once in a while? ♪ From boys' home to boys' home Till I was 18 ♪ Yo, Chief. Got anything tasty for me? Like fucking candy. Hmm, Cherokee Purple. It's an honor to meet you. Thank you, sir. You can cut the "sir" crap. My name is Rusty, Rusty Jennings. Thanks, Mike. Hey, you mind grabbing my boots? Hey, Dave. You want a beer? I'm good, thank you. Thank you. Mike's the best I ever worked with. He says you're the best he's ever worked with. Yeah. Well, he, uh... He taught me everything I know. Our reputation is the only commodity we got left in this game. You reading my story? Yours, mine, Mike's, Mason's. It's all the same fucking story. Shit, even your father's. My father has nothing to do with this. Due respect. And due respect... sure he does. We gave them our minds, our bodies and our spirit. And they chewed us up and spit us out. Left us with fear, rage, uncertainty, disillusionment, a sense of abandonment, betrayal. And finally, self-loathing and guilt. As if somehow, everything that happened to us was our own goddamn fault. I know exactly where you are right now, son. I was you. Hell, we all were. That's why we started our own tribe. I know you got options in front of you. And if you're looking for a big payday, the top tiers can give it to you. Triple Canopy, Aegis and that soulless fuck-pig, Erik Prince. But I need you to hear me 'cause I mean this. The stink from those gigs, it will rub off on you. So what is it that you do? You offer up something different or what? Damn straight. I can give you a real home, honorable work. No corporate interest, no babysitting billionaires, no bullshit. We operate with direct presidential authority under Title 50. Deal strictly with matters of national security. A deep black OGA offshoot. Title 50. I know those guys. We worked together downrange. We import and export coffee. Man, what you did in uniform, sledgehammer shit. Our thing, scalpel work. High-speed, low drag, fangs only come out when they have to. There's a situation in Berlin that threatens our national security. The team led by Mike will be fully black since our presence is not approved. How long? Two weeks. Three, tops. So what do you say? You down for the cause? Yeah. For sure. Excellent. Mike and Dalton will walk you through the paperwork. In the meantime, Brianne and Jack obviously... Uh, what do they have to do with this? Well, when you get back, be nice if we all got together and broke some bread. But for now, Dalton's gonna cut you a check for 50K. So you're not sweating them while you're working with us. Thank you. - Hey. - Hi. Mmm. Why was your phone off? I got a job. You got a job? What kind of job did you get? That kind of job. It's babysitting corporates. It's not dangerous. Don't tell me that. Now I know you're lying. No, I'm not. Look at me. I'm not. Baby, I need to take care of my family. You're gonna miss Jack's birthday. Flight departs in eight hours. It take you longer than 15 minutes to get here? Only took me eight. Salim Mohsin, 42. Professor Emeritus of virology. Humboldt-Universität, Berlin. He lectures there a few times a month, but his primary focus is research work which is conducted at a private laboratory 40 kilometers east of town. Threat level? It's bioterrorism. Category A. Car is in the parking lot. Fiat Tipo. The results are incredible. We need to protect them though. I suspect someone at our branch. Damn it! We are all in danger. Salim? Wakey-wakey, eggs and bakey.

You're gonna tell 'em yourself. I want it to be you. I'm gonna get us home. You hear me? With us now to shed more light on the explosion and gunfight in Berlin is security expert William Sonobe. Uh, William, can you... can you give us any new information on this critical scene? Thanks for having me on, Erica. US officials have been active in offering aid and intelligence support to our German friends. You have to stop saving my ass. That makes two you owe me. How the fuck did you carry me out? So what's the plan? We get the laptop home. Let's get paid. Let's have a beer. Roger that. I'm down. You take it in. No, no. We go together. I'll compromise the mission. We don't know what's in that bag. Get it home. You go. I'll catch up. I'll make contact. I'll come back. Yeah. Back to the Four Seasons of Tunnels? Come on. I'll be fine. I'll move in the dark.

Get back here, son. - Hallo. - Willkommen. Uh, Ketner. Reisepass, bitte. Danke schoen. Your friend has already checked in and paid for the room. Ja. - It's room 210. - Mmm. - Enjoy your stay! - Danke schoen. Today, we think about the families of the dead policemen who, in a suspected terrorist attack, lost their lives. Our prayers go out to their families... Hallo? Good morning. Is there a message for me? No, nothing I'm afraid. Danke. Where the hell are you? - Hallo. - Hi. I would like to buy a phone. - Which one do you want? - That one. Also a SIM card. This is Rusty. Go. I'm on a burner. It's not secure. Copy that. We don't have a choice. Physical condition? Compromised but not critical. Did Wolf Two make contact? Wolf Two never made it to Berlin. I've got an extraction team en route to the hotel, get you over to the airfield. Confirm location. Hey, stay with me. Confirm location. I'll do that when you brief me on Wolf Two. You'll get a full brief when you're secure. Right now everything is extremely fubar, and we are highly exposed. Listen to me. Everything I am doing right now is to get you home. Back to the ranch safe and sound. You feel me? - Yes, sir. Of course. - Then confirm your location. Alexanderplatz. Heavy police. Alexanderplatz. Copy that. Stand by. How long to reroute them to the Elsen Bridge? Fifteen, 20. I need you to start heading for the water. Down towards the Elsen Bridge. Northwest corner. Fifteen, 20 minutes. This is Rusty. Go. I'm at the Elsen Bridge. Northwest corner. Brown BMW X1. Confirm. Confirm. Copy that. If Wolf Two didn't make it to Berlin, how'd he arrange my exfil then? Look, I understand. Right now nothing makes sense. But you gotta trust me. I am trying to help you. Same way you helped Mike? You motherfucker. Did you kill him? Who are we working for? Stop acting like a child and get in the fucking car. If this goes down, I'm gonna come for you. Get in the fucking car. Fuck! You American? You're a fucking marine? Are you a marine? Was. Recon. What was your mission? Extraction. Then the ranch gave an audible. Terminate after pickup. When? On the bridge, when I saw you. My partner, you go after him? Huh? I heard they picked him up. I'm sorry. They told us we'd be saving lives, not killing our own. My... ...picture, please. There is... There's a safe house. Use this code for pickup. Take my phone. You can never go home. The kill code is Tomahawk. It'll stop the team, at least for a while. Rusty said he'd make us all rich. Kurier. Yes? - Shh. - Who are you? What do you want? Who are you? I'm not here to hurt you or your family. But if you don't answer all of my questions, I will. Your husband secured his work someplace safe. I need to know where. Sylvie, look at me. Look at me. For Yanis, for Olivier. Tell me where. - Swiss Credit Bank. - Swiss Credit Bank? - Safe deposit box. - Safe deposit box. Don't hurt my son. Shh, just breathe. It's gonna be fine. - Tell him to get ready. - Yes. You tell him I'm an old friend of his dad's, and we're going out for lunch. Yanis. Get ready, sweetie. We're having lunch with one of your dad's friends. Let's go. He's coming with me. We'll be here when you get back. Wait for me, please. You were his friend? Yes. Are you sad? Yes. Me too. Where did you meet? Paris. Where was your first child born? - I was born... - Tais-toi! I have two boys to raise. Everything we have is in your hands. Answer the question. Um... Yanis was born in Boston. What were you gonna call your third child? Jordan. Stop the car. So, how much did they pay you, huh? I hope it was worth it. Yes? Recon. 6-22-34. Mayday. Copy. Location? Berlin. Condition? Mobile. 0300 tomorrow. GPS 14.98, 51.150. Are you lost? Do you mind lowering the gun? You called me. It's the price of admission. There's no need to fight anymore. Where's my bag? So... are we good? It's okay. You're safe here. I cleaned your knee. It was badly infected. You tore your ACL. I don't know how you walked on it, but you did. The marine who told me about you... You know him? No. Did you kill him? No, but I know they train us to run their errands. Kill their enemies and kill each other. "National security." It's just a rock they can hide their dirty shit under. I need to get back. Back where? Back home. That's done. Home is a memory. You need... You almost died. - Your body needs rest. - I'm fine. - Shh. All right. - I'm fine. Yanis, in case I'm not here to tell you this in person, I love you. I know you have felt my absence these last few years. I need you to know why. I made up my mind very early that my children would live without fear. And because of that, I chose to dedicate my life to science. Unfortunately, there are powerful people who ignore science, even subvert it for their own personal gain. Yanis, in your hands is my life's work: the vaccine for the H5N1 virus with a mortality rate of 16%. It may have landed me in this chair, staring into this camera instead of your eyes, but I want you to know that your father stood for something, created something that with your help will benefit humanity long after they've shot me down. It is very important that this vaccine is available free to the public should the unthinkable happen. Dear Lord, thank you for this meal and bringing my guest here safely. Forgive us our sins and keep us from the fires of hell. May our souls go to heaven. Especially those in need of thy mercy. Amen. Amen. Your tat. OD3224. That's tip of the spear. Mmm. Yeah, they kept us busy. In Iraq or Afghanistan? Both. You ever been to Hindu Kush? Mountains so high, you think heaven's resting on 'em. The valleys so green, you think it's Eden. I thought I was in Colorado when I first saw it. You know, we were on a 12-day straight looking for one of our local guys' kid. Been gone... Gone hunting, couldn't find him. Poor thing. So we broke down a door on this out-of-the-way compound, and then we burst in. And once we cleared everything, we found him, the kid. And he was chained to the wall, just crying his eyes out. But in the next room, it's full of girls all strung out, splayed out. And in the middle of all this was a dog. It's just a little thing. Mangy. Happy as can be. Happy to see us. All yelps and matted hair. And all that shit, and the thing I remember the most is the dog. 'Cause that dog survived all that shit without even blinking an eye. It's much easier to kill, but it's harder to survive. How long you been out here? Thirteen years. You have a family? Yeah, I've got a wife, two beautiful girls, a nice house. You ever feel like reaching out? When I reach out... I break things. We all know the monster. And sometimes he comes to stay. How's the steak? I've had better. So... So have I. Hi. - American? - Yes. Safe travels, sir. I want Christine to hear about me from you. You tell 'em yourself, Mike. Tell 'em yourself. Motherfucker. Doing at my house? Answer me. You wanna shoot me? Go ahead. I went to your house to tell Christine, like you asked me to. - Rusty said... - Did you know he was coming after me? He said you didn't make it. Why did you lie to me? - About what? - Fuck you. A real home. A tribe. Honorable work. It was a data heist. None of this was supposed to happen. But it did happen. And for what? Payday of a lifetime. What we stole was not data. It's a cure to a virus these fuckers wanna release. So they can make billions off people suffering. Did you know that? How do you fucking live with yourself? I got a family and a son with special needs. So what about my family? My son! Their needs! Everything's taken care of. There's a huge payout to Brianne and your boy. Four million. They'll never want for anything ever again. Except for me! Me! You can't go home! He finds out you're here, he's gonna come after you with everything he's got. After everything we've done, everything we've been through. I fucking bled for you! And this is what I get? James, don't do this. I'm sorry. My father, uh... He branded me to be like him. You know, a fucking... a fucking Ranger to the bone. And when they cut him loose and they cast him out, he just never came home. Vanished. No note, corpse. Fucking nothing. I finally just buried all the... shit the fucker ever gave me in the backyard. Had my own funeral. I'm standing over this pathetic little hole filled with stupid shit. And I swore to myself I would never be like him. I would never forsake my family. Do you understand me? Rusty finds out you're here, he's gonna come after your family. There's only one way this ends. Hey, what's up, Mike? You got a beer? Where is he? He's in the kitchen. Always wanted to die with my boots on. I got a room prepped and ready for ya. We're going home, Mike. Put some fucking music on. Yeah. Cold. Tell my s... My son... I didn't die in my sleep. I promise. I got you. Yeah! Cannonball! Yeah! Good job! Jack!
