I just saw that you have good skills. How long have you been practicing? I've only just started. That must mean you're very athletic. Thank you. How unexpected. The normally serious female surgeon can be so stylish, away from the operating table. Buy you a drink? Thanks, but I have one. - Hey! - Hmmm? How are you and my sister? I'm asking Dr. Shen to teach us both how to swim. My sister doesn't teach everyone. By the way, where's my birthday surprise? Hmmm. Well, it's a surprise. I can't say. Oh yeah? Let's go. Okay.

(WENDY SCREAMING) (YIRAN LAUGHING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Yiran, what's wrong with you Are you all right? I'm so scared. There's a limit to jokes. It's okay, I got you. Timmy Chow, I'm not a good swimmer. You save me or her. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Timmy Chow. Come save me. Yiran, stop. He won't care about you. You go back to the yacht first. Timmy Chow. You son of a bitch. (WENDY BREATHING HEAVILY) Are you okay? (BOTH BREATHING HEAVILY) It's all right The ladder didn't come down. I'll think of something. Don't be afraid. (BOTH BREATHING HEAVILY) Timmy Chow, what's your problem? Is this your surprise for me? Do you believe I'm going to die with you today? (INTENSE MUSIC) (YIRAN SCREAMING) It's a shark. Swim to the boat. Come on. (YIRAN SCREAMING) Move it!

(SHEN GRUNTING) (OMINOUS MUSIC) - Wendy! - Wendy, Wendy, wake up. - Wendy, wake up. - Wendy, wake up. Has she ever had blood-sickness before? I don't know. Wendy. Wendy! Wendy, wake up! Wendy. What's wrong Wendy? Take your clothes off. What for? Quickly. Okay. [SHEN] Sleeves. Take the sleeves off. Sleeves? Yeah. Wendy, Wendy, can you hear me? (TIMMY GRUNTING) Use a harpoon. Wendy, just hold on. Hurry. - Here. - Come here. Hold the wound for me. (SUSPENSEFUL ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Wendy, hold on, Wendy. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Wendy. Hang in there. This will only slow down her bleeding, but I'm worried that she'll lose too much blood over time. It's life-threatening. So, what do we do till then? She needs a hospital. Hospital? How do we get to a hospital right now? (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (SHEN BREATHING HEAVILY) Hang in there. Come and help! Oh, okay. (BOTH GRUNTING) It's stuck. We need to cut the rope. We need the rope to get back to the yacht. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) [TIMMY] Hold on, Wendy. What do we do? You take care of her. I'll go down and untie the anchor rope. There's a shark down there. If we want to survive, we have to untie the anchor so that we can swim to the opposite yacht. You have to be careful. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Watch out! Oh. (SUSPENSEFUL ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) (SUSPENSEFUL ORCHESTRAL MUSIC CONTINUES) (OMINOUS MUSIC) (WENDY GASPING) Timmy. You're awake. Great! Scared the hell out of me. I'm glad you're okay. It's all right. [WENDY] My leg. You were attacked by a shark. When you came aboard It was Dr. Shen who stopped your bleeding. Are you all right? Where's Dr. Shen? I don't know. (OMINOUS MUSIC) (SHEN GASPING) (SHEN BREATHING HEAVILY) Dr. Shen, thank you, from me and Timmy. As a doctor, I have a duty to save you. But as Yiran's sister, (DRAMATIC ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) I didn't have to do that. Quick. We'll row that way first. (DRAMATIC ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Why doesn't the boat feel like it's moving? The tide is now out. We have to paddle harder. It must be faster than that, otherwise it is more dangerous for everyone to be washed up in the deep sea. (BOTH GRUNTING) (DRAMATIC ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) (ALL GRUNTING) (DRAMATIC ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) (ALL GRUNTING) (DRAMATIC ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) (DRAMATIC ORCHESTRAL MUSIC CONTINUES) Blame it on Yiran. If it wasn't for her, we wouldn't be where we are now. What do you mean? Are you serious? Did I say it wrong? I would have said goodbye to her a long time ago. She's the one who's been bugging me. I brought Wendy here today just to tell her, it's finished, we're done. Her death has nothing to do with us. (BOTH GRUNTING) (SUSPENSEFUL ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) (ALL GASPING) Give it to me.

[SHEN] Plug it up with your clothes! (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Timmy, what do we do? The boat is sinking. Follow me with the anchor rope, come on. But Dr. Shen. We can't be bothered with her. No, we, we can't leave her. You talk too much. (WENDY GASPING) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (TIMMY GRUNTING) (SHEN GRUNTING) Don't move. It won't see us if we don't move. (SUSPENSEFUL ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Don't make a sound. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Okay. Come on.

Nothing? (DRAMATIC ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) If I hadn't come today, things wouldn't have been so bad. If is the most meaningless word there is. (DRAMATIC ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) It's my fault. I actually knew it a long time ago. Timmy and Yiran, they were not ordinary classmates, but I just love him. I just want to be with him. And I- - You know he can't live without you. So many people want to get close to me and say they like me and want to take care of me. How many of them are sincere, and not for some of my money? It's fine. I'm okay with it. I think it's good that everyone is happy. I actually want very little. I just want them to love me. I don't want anything else. Maybe, in this world, there is no such thing as love. (DRAMATIC ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) When I was an intern before, in that ward, there was a vegetative patient of 10 years, but her husband visited her every day. First he rubs her body and then he tells her the story of the day, current events, tells her about the movie that just came out, and the music she likes. I was very silly at that time. I can't believe I even asked him. What's the point of you doing this? She can't hear you. But he answered me with particular cheerfulness. "It's not that she can't hear, just can't answer." So in this world, pure love can exist. That is what love should be like. (LIGHT ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) I want to live. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Are you okay? (DRAMATIC ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Now the boat is leaking all the time, but it doesn't matter. Do you see that float on that side? That float, it's for divers to resupply in an emergency. We'll have to gamble that the sharks don't come tonight. We'll swim together to that float. We'll have a good chance of surviving. Can you do it?

(WENDY GASPING) I'm here I'm here. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) We'll go over there together, to the float. (SUSPENSEFUL ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) (SHEN GASPING) (SUSPENSEFUL ORCHESTRAL MUSIC CONTINUES) (SHEN GASPING) (WENDY GASPING) Come on. We made it. We'll make it back to shore. I'm going to meet you at the hospital. I'm thinking It won't leave a scar, will it? Come on up! (WENDY GASPING) (INTENSE MUSIC) Come on, Wendy, come on! Get up!
