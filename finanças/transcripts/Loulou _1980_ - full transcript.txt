Isn't Loulou here? - Get lost, Dominique. Look at yourself. What did you do this time? Isn't there any beer left? - No idea. I'd be surprised. Don't you have five francs? - I don't have anything at all. I should have known. Ok, see you later. - See you. Little girl... There he is. He'll comfort you. He's nice. Go ahead. - Come here. Come. Stop crying, damnit. Give me a kiss. Come on. Come, let's go dance somewhere. - With the others? Did you enjoy your dinner? Do you like that music? You can shake your ass. I think he looks dirty. You wouldn't mind doing it with him. He's drunk. - That won't stop you. Talk about having good taste... - Give me a break. Do you do it on purpose? - Stop it, Andr?. Stop it. Allow me to ask your wife to dance? No, I'm tired. Later. Well, are you doing it on purpose? - Leave me alone. I can see the game you're playing. Don't push it. Are you laughing? Do you think it's funny? - Yes, I do. Do you want another one? You hurt me. - Come on, that was nothing. Asshole. What's wrong now? - Nothing. I'm fed up with him. He doesn't mean it like that. Do you? I should sleep with that guy to piss him off. Get lost. I can't handle it any longer. I'm fed up with him. I'm fed up with you. He won't even remember what you said. You know how it goes. I'm not going home with you. - Let's go. I don't want to. You go. I'm staying. Come, let's dance. - Stop it. Come on. I'm fed up. What happened? The bed is broken. I'll have a look. Help me lift it. - How do I do that? Can't you fix it? At least, we can't get any lower. That sucks. - Stop it. Some people sleep at night. What do I do now? Get in. Quickly. Don't scream like that. You're crushing me. I'm going to try again. Don't scream. Everybody can hear us. This is the first time I'm cheating. Do you want to go home? - No, I'm scared. Will you tell him? Hello. Are you having lunch? - Do you want some? What? I spent the night at Annie's. - I didn't say anything, did I? Get out. Get your things and get out. Did you hear me? Get out. - What's wrong with you? Not like that. You have to take everything. I don't want to see any of your things here. Not even a pair of knickers. Pack your bags. Come on. Do I have to carry everything out? - I'll help you. And hurry up. Here. Do I have to put it all into 2 suitcases? - Do like your ancestors did. You take a sheet and tie it into a bundle. Look, like this. Put everything in it. Very simple. Like in the old days. Look, your boots as well. Look, very simple. - You don't even treat a dog like this. Let me go. - I don't want any of your things here. I don't care about those things. Throw them out of the window. I'm fed up. I'm so fed up. Get lost. Get lost. Get lost and leave me alone. Calm down a bit. Fuck off. Did you calm down? Leave me alone. Do you need to rest? Do you want some rest? It's not so bad. Do you forgive me? Rest a bit. It's over. I'm coming for my tomatoes. - Are they yours? No, my grandmother's. - Good that I didn't eat them. What are you doing here? Hello, Mrs Lestingois. What are you doing? Where are you going? What's that? - Tomatoes. I'll warm them up. Very sweet of you, but I don't want any tomatoes. You said we'd spend the evening together. Between the sheets, you mean? No, I'm going out. I want to go out too. - Out of the question. What did I do? - Nothing. I'm going out. I want to come with you, Loulou. I said No, didn't I? - What did I do? I said I didn't want you to come. That's all. The drama queen. - You went too far. She'll be crying here for another hour. - Not my business. Stuffed tomatoes. Let's warm them up. This street really changed. There used to be a grocer, a baker and a butcher. Now trendy, fake shops and restaurants for gays. And antique shops. - Look, that's nice. A nice shop, don't you think? - It smells of death, of dust. Those cups are pretty. Do you remember that baker? That's what it's all going to be like. Do you mind if I don't come? - I can't cancel. You can do business without me. These business dinners are boring. I'd rather go to Annie. You always support me. - Just not this once. My coat pocket has come undone. - I'll fix it tomorrow. So you're not coming? - No. I'll see you later. That feels good to wake up like this. Nothing like a quickie in the morning. - You're so heavy. Nothing like a quickie in the morning. What's wrong? Do you find it scary? Chapouf. What does that mean? - Something American. It's translated into French. - Chapouf is not American. It is American. Chapouf, chapouf. Then it would be cat pouf. - For me, it's American. You know your languages, don't you? - Chapouf is not American. It's American for me. - Does it hurt? No, it gives you a fever. - Fever? Or it swells up. Depends. - Will you give me one too? Where? Three packs of Gitanes, Ren?. I never see you anymore. What are you doing? Nothing, but I'm busy. Put it on my tab. I'm soaking some laundry. Did you call? - Yes, to my sister-in-law. And? - Nothing. He thinks I drowned myself. - What will you do? I don't know. Gain some time. How old is he? - Nine months. Don't you have another one? Where is he? - Somewhere outside. Is the other one with your mother? - No, with somebody who looks after him. Why? Since you're not working anymore. One child is enough. Let's talk about something else. Hi, darling. What would you like to drink? - A beer. Hello, Dominique. Everything ok? Aren't you working today? - No. I know that it's over. - Yes. You know what he's like. He doesn't even talk to me. - It'll be alright. I'd rather leave. Ren? is the only one who... What do I owe you? - Eightteen francs. Each time you go to jail he supports you. Ren?, my fianc?e Nelly. - Nice. A nice girl, right? - Absolutely. How's the hunt going? He wants to make love to you. What should I say? - No. He wants to pay if you go with him. So? No, of course. - She's not interested. Ask her yourself. Give me a kiss. Will you never sleep with me again? - I don't know. And, do you like my fianc?e? - Should I? Hello. Would you like a drink? What are you having? - Cognac. I'll have the same. - Can I have another cognac? What do you do for work? - I'm a bookkeeper. Terrible. And do you come here every night? - Yes, what else can I do? Have you been... Have you been playing music for long? - Pretty long. I wouldn't have guessed. - Keep playing. You like this, don't you? Well, I don't. Do you want a sip? Sure? Keep playing. - Here, a sip. Go ahead. I'm not jealous, you know. I'm not jealous. Not at all. What do you want? What do you really want? I'd be surprised if he'd change. - I'll take him the way he is. Don't you have anything better to do? We're going to close. It's late. Come on, let's go. I'm bloody horny. I flirted with Dominique. - With Dominique? Yes. I like her. I met her... ...just before I went in jail. I like her. She kept writing to me. Do you still think about her? - She wanted money. Do you still think about her? No, I don't, but if I'd see her now... ...I might fuck her pretty badly. Do you understand? What are you doing? What happened? Did you fall? You know what I'd want the most? - Tell me. Tell me. Do I have to? I can't. Do you want to marry me? Yes. Where are my cigarettes? My cigarettes? - No idea. Aren't they there? That tea is cold. Can I have a drag? Are you coming for the mail? No, I've come to pick up some things. You should stay. He's very unhappy. Such a beautiful couple. And he spoilt you. He misses you so much. - Look after him then. That's not the same thing. I look after him well, but he misses you so much. And I'm not always here. Will you come back? - Yes, next week. See you then. Stay. He might come any moment. - No, I have to go. Bye. I thought you'd be alone. - I hadn't understood. Let's go outside. I'll be right back. Shall we go for a ride? Is his name Loulou? - I call him Louis. What a mug. - Why? You can't stay with a guy like that. - Why not? Those three years of us don't count? - Of course they do. So? Lust is temporary. - I want both. What is it about him? - He's insatiable. You're a real slut. I'd rather kill you. You're crazy. Let go of me. - I did let go. Louis, Louis. Leave me alone. - I'm not afraid of him. Then you're both dead. This will end badly. - Let go of me. Don't. You're hurting me. No, stop it. Stop it. No Louis, let go of him. You really can't do this. Who pays for that mailbox? - I lost my button. You're going to pay. That mailbox is dented. Are you aware of that? Who pays for the mailbox? He's going to pay for it. Come here. I can talk to him, can't I? I want to talk to you. Let's go and have a drink. Three beers, please. No, never mind. How much is it? - 9 francs 60. Do you need money? No, there's still some in the bank. - How much? About 500,000 francs. - That won't get you very far. What bothers me is who's going to do your work? Now what? We'll have to find somebody else. You can come back. I don't feel like a lot of scenes. - There won't be any. No scenes. Well? Would it bother you? - No, she can do what she wants. It'll be torture for you. No, quite the opposite. You know what I'm like. I'd be able to see you. That would help me get over it. So, no? I don't know. We'll see. Alright. Give me a call. Don't be unhappy, ok? - I'm not unhappy. May I? - No, not yet. Later then? - In ten minutes. Are you alright? - Yes. I like working with you. We can make something of this. Don't you think? Don't do that. It's not for you. - You're spoiling him. Take it off. It doesn't suit you. - It suits me very well. Everything ok, love birds? Nobody loves each other anymore. Everybody's getting a divorce. Have you got friends with children? - Annie and Michel are a real couple. They're a company. - Asshole. But for the rest... - Don't start again. I can't say anything anymore. I'd hate to live in a hotel. I close the door behind me and I forget about everything. Look, how beautiful. Cotton factory in New Orleans, detail. Museum of... Museum of Pau. You'll need glasses soon. I didn't know that Degas. What are you doing this weekend? - I might go to Amsterdam. Monica called. If I don't come, she gets angry. Go then, get your mind off things. - We could have gone together. There's a Rembrandt exhibition. Go then. See you on Monday. Can I call you tomorrow? - Why? It would do me good. - No, it wouldn't. What time shall I call? - I don't know. At five o'clock. Ok. - Bye. It's me. I could call you at five. You're waking me up. What do you want? Nothing. Just to talk. I just want to talk to you. And I could call you. This sucks. You woke me up. But what is it that you want? Look, I want a sweater like that in black. - Go have a look. I'm going to my mother. Is it you? I haven't seen R?my for a long time. If he's fired, he can stay away. I'll throw him out. - Ok. Hello. What are you doing? - Going for a walk. And you? I'm waiting for mum. What are you doing tonight? No idea. And you? - We'll see each other later. You have a new fianc?e. And she's not a slut, like the others. What does a decent girl see in you? And you live in a hotel. - Yes. And who pays for it? - She does. You're going very far, aren't you? Look, this is Nelly. My mother. We'll walk with you for a bit. I'm going to buy some apples. - I'd prefer clementines. Can I have a pound of clementines? She's so in love. How do you do that? - Oh, that's how it goes. I was never very tempted by these kind of things. But then I got pregnant each and every time. How are you? - Fine. You too? Good. Here. take it. - No, I can't. It's not important to her and it makes me happy. Thank her on my behalf. - Where are you going? Just for a walk. - Don't come back too late. She'll get worried. - Ok. See you later. Look that's me. At the municipal school in the Rue Clerc. Did you wear that to school? - No, she made it look like that. Are you ready, darling? Hurry up. - Do they know we're coming? Make yourselves at home. - Thanks. Everything ok? - Yes. To Meg?ve? - Yes, skiing. Cross-country? - Yes, cross-country skiing. Make yourselves at home. Use anything you want. I'll be back Monday at the latest. Just put the key under the mat. - Thanks. Have a nice holiday. Bye. What a pigsty. Behind the screen, there's all kinds of junk. What are you doing? - Looking for a picture of Diane. She's pretty. And common. Not everyone's a little princess like you. I can't find the bottle opener. That's a pity. Help me find it. - Don't talk to me like that. I've already found it. Show me? You look like a teacher. Are you in a bad mood? Don't you love me anymore? I can't touch you either? In that case I deny you my willie for a week. You're pathetic. You don't mind the music, do you? Who is it? - It's me, Cathy. I can't find Jean-Louis. He went to see a friend and didn't come back. I waited for an hour. I didn't know where else to go. Of course. - I'll sleep on the ground. Out of the question. This bed is big enough for three. Move over, Nelly. Move over a bit. - I can't go further or I'll fall out. Only one left. - Shall I get some? That would be nice. - I'll be back. No, I'll do it. Can I lay here? - Yes. Make yourself comfortable. I'd rather have you come with me. I'm scared. Does he leave you like that often? - He has problems with the business. We'll take a hotel. - What about Loulou? That'll teach him. I hate him at the moment. Fat Marit? is here. Turn it off. - I didn't see a thing. And I've seen that ass before. Hey, Marit?. - Leave me alone. What are you doing to me? - She doesn't want to. Don't you want to share anymore? - Leave us alone. If you sleep here, I'm gone. - Leave something for my little brother. I'm hungry. Did you hear me, fatso? Make some fries. - She's not your maid. Listen to that. Come, let's go. You can find this type anywhere. Ok, come on. Where's Nelly? - She's asleep. A glass of red wine, please. Is it serious with Nelly? No idea. I'm not thinking about it. I take life the way it comes. Or else I'd be wondering what she wants with me. Things are going ok. She seems to be in love with you. - Yes, with my dick. Like all the others. That's all they're interested in. Would you dump her for Diane? - I don't think so. In ten years, Diane will be just like her. Ok. I'm going to take a leak. I think so. - That guy from the other day. Excuse me, can I get past? What's this? - Don't you know me? I only wanted to go for a piss. What's this? Come along. Damn. You have to go to hospital. - I want a beer. You're nuts. I want another beer. - We're closed. I want a beer, damnit. Open up or I'll kick the door in. Open up. I'm not alone. - Are you his doggie? What happened to you? - What would you like? I've been stabbed. - My jacket is fucked. Brand new. I know. But don't move for a sec. Explain to her that it wasn't my fault. She'll believe you. I'm thirsty. Get some beer. It's not very serious. No damage to the peritoneum, I think. Does he have to stay? - A couple of days. No more? - No. Do I sit here? Nice. - We'll look after him well. Quite funny. We'll look after him well. Am I disturbing you? I could have had company. Come in. Are you having a fight? - No, Loulou has been stabbed. A stereo set. - I never use it. I start playing something and turn it off again. You can have it. Where would I put it? You could educate your guy. Play Mozart while you... I haven't changed the sheets since you left. Surprising for a maniac like you. I've changed, believe it or not. Would you like a drink? - No, thanks. What happened? - He pushed one of their women. With his hand on her ass, I bet. That's no reason to stab a person. Weren't you with him? You're the good housewife at home, while he's getting pissed. And wastes his time with... What would you know? It doesn't change a thing. It doesn't make him fuck me less. Do you like saying that? - No, but you asked for it. If you think he stays in bed like a good boy while you're working... ...you've got another thing coming. - What do you care? I hate the idea that a girl like you has to pay for love. Because that's what it boils down to. No, not at all. I fell for a guy who has no money. I do, so I pay. Better a poor guy who fucks me well than a rich loser. What if he had any ambitions? If he had to work, would he still fuck you as often? No, that's true. But I like it that he's always available. Are you never bored? I'm never bored, just like when I was with you. What do you talk about? Not about books. I read, but I don't need to talk about it. And I can do without books, but not without people. I'm not here to make a scene... ...but because I felt lonely and wanted to see you. Alright then. I'm beat. - You can sleep there. I'll sleep in the little room. I'll give you clean sheets. - Never mind. It's not worth it. But there might be semen stains. Come on, what do I care? So you don't care about my life? Ok, I'll go to sleep. - Sleep well. You do have a sense of humour. Did you see this? All bullshit. - No, not at all. Have a good rest. Can I take the Express? I'm going to sleep. Sleep well. Did you make tea? What's in my pockets? Don't you want to wash my socks? - You've got some guts. I'm not going to wash your socks. - I'll make a cup of tea. What are we doing this morning? Go to the exhibition of Lorrain? In the Grand Palais? - Yes. I'm going to Loulou in hospital at 12 o'clock. Strange, for a moment I thought things were back the way they were. Hello. Are you ok? Are you in a lot of pain? - Yes. Really? - Yes. Did it hurt a lot when they stitched the wound? It's so warm. Is there anything to drink? There's water. It's tepid. - I can't help that. Make some room. I can move around very well. Are you doing well? - Very well. Don't scream like that. - Are you happy? No, I'm sad. Don't touch it. - I'm only caressing you. Control yourself a bit. He could use his energy better. What are you doing here? - Yes, what? We now live in the same neighbourhood. - Are you doing ok? Where are you going? - We're walking across the market. I'm going home again. That smells nice. I'll call you. Alright? - Please do. And come see us one day. That's ok. Everything ok? I'm going to get dressed. I'll be right back. Not bad. - It's furnished. Isn't Loulou there? - He's gone with his friends. A real love nest. I should have something like this, now that I'm on my own. Such a big apartment on my own gets me down. And when I open the closets and I see all those empty clothes hangers... Do you want some coffee? You smell nice. Is it that Spanish lotion? Come, let's go. Are we going to work? I don't turn you on, do I? Didn't you understand that I really wanted you? That's a beautiful painting. The Visit to the Grandfather. I'm pregnant with Loulou. I want to keep the child. How far along are you? - About two months. What does Loulou think? - He's very excited. And you? - I'm very happy. Are you in bed with me to tell me that? - No, I just wanted you. I don't know why. Come, let's go. I'll take you there. - I'll take a cab. Yes, alright. See you in a bit then. I'm coming over. Did you wait long? - Not too long. I have to see a friend who has problems. Nothing special. Don't worry. Bye bye. - Will you both come over for dinner? I'm a good cook. - So you cook? That's good. Very good. Come, let's go. There they are. Hello, Thomas. Did Marie-Jo allow you to go like that? If you leave with this guy, I'm off. - It's nothing. Do what you want, but know that I'll be gone. I'm not going to involve Loulou in a dangerous job. What time? - 11 o'clock. Shall we go now then? Calm down a bit. Where are we going? - Champigny. Don't be afraid. I'm not afraid. - And don't pull such a long face. Give me a kiss. Everything's ok. Shall we? Can we? - Yes. A nice trophy. - Definitely. Open the gate, Thomas. Give it to me. Make yourself at home. It's upstairs. - Is there wine? Yes. You know the way. And don't make any noise. Quiet or he'll wake up. Give them something to drink. Hush. - We deserve a drink. Get the glasses. - Come, I want to show you something. You have a nice place. - Isn't it beautiful? You're like Father Christmas. Yes, it's a beautiful thing. - Pretty good, hey? Don't touch it. You could break it. Come, I'll show you my son. To work. Hello. Everything ok? Yes? Yes, we're waiting. Yes, still. Nice mood you're in. Do you think I'm an idiot? You're half asleep here. Do I have to support you and your guy after you've been going for it all night? I'm not that much of a masochist. You do it on purpose, to torture me. Well, I'm not playing along anymore. You're not the only one in the world. I thought I could bear it, but I can't. So, I have to leave when you've got somebody else? - Fuck off. What's wrong? I'm going to buy cigarettes. This is Lulu, a friend of mine. What is it? Do you still love him? - Not at all. You wouldn't act like this if you didn't. Did you have sex with him? - Where did you get that idea? Somebody told me. - And who's that? Somebody who got it from Andr? himself. - That's very unlikely. Never mind. Come in. Oh, no. What an idiot. The flowers are for you. - Very sweet. He'll stay here for a while. - No problem. He's fresh out of jail. - lf I'm not imposing... No, but we have no extra bed. - Oh, I can sleep anywhere. Thanks, that was sweet. - Maybe I can help. No need to. What do you want to eat? - A bit of meat. I'll help you anyway. Planet Earth is threatened by intruders. Yes, by this kind of bullshit. We're going to tell everybody that we love them. And that we're getting married. We'll tell them right away. Shall we then? - Yes. Are we going to tell them? - Absolutely. No, I don't want to go. My mother might be there. I'll go back home. We'll see each other next holiday, ok? Yes, maybe. I'm going to get some fruit. I'll be right back. Will you join me after lunch? - Yes. Hello, Nelly. - Hello. Everything ok? Have you got everything you need? - Is everything ok? Did you call mum? - Yes. Still arguing with Andr?? So you know already. - Yes. Nice place. - Yes. Do you know Loulou? Wait, I'll get... - Isn't it noisy here? The delivery men wake us up in the morning. That's all. Is the rent high? - Ask Nelly. 1000 francs. - That's not so bad. We can't complain. What will you do when the child is born? Why do you ask? - Because I worry about my sister. You don't seem to want to work. - I want to, but I don't know what. You could be a cab driver. They took away my driving licence. And at my age I'm not going to work somewhere for 2000 a month. What can you do? Everything. Everything and nothing. We're not getting anywhere. Don't you want to own a bar? But that costs a lot of money. Who's going to pay for it? A successful bar's expensive. And an unsuccessful one's a money pit. - I can help. I'm prepared to help if you have any ideas. There's no hurry. I always had enough to eat. And so will the little one. What would you do if anything was possible? - Nothing at all. How's mum? - Fine. You should visit her more often. And bring Loulou. - I'd like to meet... I'd like to get to know your mother. - Sure. Sure. Hello, Pierrot. How are you? So you're in Paris. Give him a chair. Am I interrupting? - Not at all. Sit down. That's the brother of... Yes, this is Michel, my brother. How are you? - Fine. Are you coming on Sunday? I'd like to. - Good. Good. Good evening. Everything's been said. Goodbye then. Everything's been said. - Yes. I'll call you. Please do. - Bye, Michel. And thanks. Say hi to Annie. That door's jammed. How's your brother-in-law? He keeps going on about work. Have you gone mad? A car like this needs a kick up the ass sometimes. The brakes are fucked. Give me the keys. I'll drive from now on. - Don't exaggerate. It does a car like that good. There they are. Hello, how are you? Bravo, Pierrot. Everything ok? I've been thinking for a week about what to serve you. He bought and prepared everything. Hello, little one. He's grown. He's grown so much. Hello, aunt. Can I give this to you? Better put the meat on. Here you are. His name is Miss. Hello, Marie-Jo, how are you? Are you happy? I'm not staying. Thomas is angry. What's wrong with him? My daughter's husband terrorises everybody. I like him alright, but sometimes... And she thought she'd hit the jackpot... Bravo, Pierrot. My compliments. Marie-Jo, this is Lulu, a friend of mine. My sister Marie-Jo. Sit down. A drink? - A glass of white please. And Fran?oise? Are you coming, Fran?oise? Aunt Fran?oise. Will you have a glass with us? - Little Maria. See you for the coffee. And you, Nelly? - Give her something. What do you want to drink? - A ricard. Tell me. - She wants a martini. They look well. Did you open them? - We both did. It was a lot of work. To us. I'm drinking to us. Pass me the martini. Never mind, I'll get it myself. Who wants a martini? - Can I get some water? And what do you want, Pierrot? - To us. Wait, that's enough. Take it easy, ok? - Do you want some nibbles? No, thanks. I'll put the bottles here. Too much pastis? Careful or you'll get drunk. Strong, isn't it? - Yes. Too strong. Don't worry. Alright, who's serving? - Not her. She's drunk already. She can't serve. Hey, what's that? No, Miss, or you'll go on the leash. He's good. Is it nice? Ah, the lemons. - Superb. You don't have a plate, Fran?oise. - We miscounted. Opening them is a pain, but they taste nice, don't they? Vinegar or lemon? What will you do when the child arrives? No idea. I'll have to start working. I'll have to for the little one. What will you do then? - No idea. Just find work. What kind of work? - What they'll offer me. Will you really work? - Yes, I feel like it. I'll become a bottle opener or something. - That sounds like a bad idea. I'll be a cellar hand for Nicolas. Do you want some more? The chicken. Come here. Come here, Miss. Come here. Come here. Go get that chicken. Go away, you. - Come here. He bit the chicken. Our lunch. Don't make a mess. I was invited. - And you'll eat. We only have water left. - Is that all? That needs to roast a bit longer. Fran?oise's checking it already. There are some good ones left. - I hadn't seen them. That's ok. Wait until it's been roasted. Here, for the shells. - Nice. We use clean plates. - Who does the dishes here? We're the guests. Pierrot does the dishes. Why do I have to do them? Are you alright? I'm not going to do the dishes with you. Do you want ice-cream for desert? Better than with mum and dad. - Better than a lollipop. You're a dear. Pierrot was the same age when he came to me. His dad ran away and his mother was working, so... He only had to cross the street. One day it was 11 in the evening already and he still hadn't eaten anything. So I took him into the house. Did you adopt him? - Yes, I did. So I had another child. A good thing you have us, isn't it? - Definitely. Anyway, I'm very pleased that you're all here. He's very content, aren't you? - Yes, I'm very content. He looks content. He even gained weight. - He could gain a bit more. That's pretty heavy though. 80, 90 kilos. Bam. - You need two guys for that. Aren't you bored with me? - No. Kiss me. Do you love me? You go. I think it's too warm. I'll see you later. The wife of my boss. She loves sex. Have you done her yet? - Come on, are you mad? Do you still see fat Marit?? - Occasionally. I see her on Saturdays. Do you fuck her in front of the old woman? - She closes her eyes. She prefers it if her daughter has a steady guy and not a different one all the time. Be careful, though. Don't get sucked in. You'd end up married. Nice to hold a woman in my arms like this. It's been a long time. What will you do? I don't give a shit about anything right now. But once I have a child... Did you shoot moorhens? - No, rats. Are we going to eat? - Without the others? I've had it with them. She's cute, isn't she? Yes, she's a sweet child. You'd like one too. - Yes, she's sweet. What's his name? - No idea. Maurice? Shall I give you a hand? - Yes, please. Be careful. Her guy's very jealous. Stuff him. - We've had enough of him. We can have some fun, can't we? - Come upstairs for a bit. I'm busy. You come downstairs. - Acting tough, are we? Leave her alone. Your lover should stay out of it. - My lover? I'm not crazy. I know which game you're playing. What on earth are you talking about? I'm not crazy. I can see it. Unbelievable. - Just continue. What does he have against Pierrot? - He's jealous. Get away from her. He's gone mad. Fuck off. Don't move or I'll shoot. Stay there. You're not going to do something stupid, are you? Get lost. Back off, you. - Put the gun away. Go pack your bag. - Better do it. He'll leave alright. - Pack your bag. I want to see him leave. - Take him with you, Marie-Jo. Try to calm him down. Let her go, Thomas. We have to do something. This is crazy. What's happening? Stop it. Come here. What are you thinking? Let him go. Will you stop now? Drop that gun. - Calm down a bit. Drop the gun. Drop it, I said. I want him to get lost. Let go. Calm down a bit. What's all this about? Fuck off, you. Stop it now. Stop it. Stop it. Listen for a moment. Stop it. Stop it. He'll leave. Asshole. Come on. Leave him be. Go, Pierrot. Nice friends you have. - Completely nuts. That was a dangerous situation. I couldn't help it. That's how you end up in jail. Come, let's have a drink. Calm down a bit. Think she managed to calm him down? - I don't understand it at all. Pierrot had better get out of here. - Yes, let's take him with us. A real cowboy, that guy. It could easily have gone wrong. We were lucky. What if he had hit her? I knew it would go like this. - He's sick. Keep me posted. - For now, he's with us. Hurry up. Come, let's go. He's really crazy. And look after yourself. Is it you? Yes, I've been awake for an hour. I'm coming home tomorrow. Aren't you saying anything? I don't know. Yes, I'm ok. Ok. Bye. And? What 'and? ' I'm afraid I'll be sick. Aren't you sick? - No, not at all. Hello, Nelly. No, don't get up. - We're leaving anyway. Are you ok? Do you have to stay in bed? - No, but I'm going to lie down for a bit. I'll see you, Pierrot. And? Happy now? - Why do you say that? I don't know. You must be relieved. Did you call your mother and your brother? They'll be happy about this. - Not at all. You wanted it yourself, so don't look so sour. You know we couldn't keep it. I can't even support myself. - You could have told me earlier. You should have told me right away that you didn't want a child. I was so looking forward to it. What an idiot. I know. But I was looking forward to it as well. It was all I thought about. I was hoping you'd start working. I would have done that when the little one arrived. How can I believe that? How can you prove that? You should have had faith in me. Are you coming, Lulu? I'm off again. Why did you ask me to come? What's happening? Nothing. Why did you never have any children? Why do you ask? Because I don't understand it. I don't get it at all. Tell me... Hello, Ren?. Come.
