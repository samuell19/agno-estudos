What is truth? It's an illusion, of course. But what do we become if we stop searching for truth? Nothing. Forget it. Hey, let's move on. Jesus. Yeah, yeah. No, that. When? You're kid. Yeah. Well, this just seems a little fast. No, yes. That makes sense, I understand what you're saying, but, here. Okay, yeah. Jesus. No, no! Can't hear you. Goddamn it. Yeah, all right. I will let everybody know. We're done. What do you mean? It's over, we're going home. No. Have you remembered the blue boxes? Yes. And are they in alphabetical order? Yes, they are. - Are you sure? - Are you fucking kidding me? 'Cause they don't look like they are. They need to be in alphabetical order every time. Okay. Thank you. Come on. No. I can't believe it's our last night in Iraq. Why? You're gonna be home, drinking a German beer, fucking your German life. Les, I, I don't have a wife. Are you fucking with me? Why did you say that you did? I didn't want you to think that I was looking for somebody. Oh, all right. So, you thought I would wanna marry you. Is that it? No. I thought you'd run away. Can I use your shower? Of course. Anthrax, milzbrand in German. Technically easy to produce. The dyed spores can survive for decades. They could be in the air you're breathing right now. In the fabric of your recently imported Middle Eastern bedsheets. You inhale, the spores germinate in your lungs and you'll be rotting alive, basically. Hello, bio-warfare. So, what is this all about? Iraq. Hello Retzlaff. Good day Dr. Wolf. You desert fox. Manne. Please, sit down. Has Retzlaff filled you in already? No, not yet. Good, let's start. Okay, so Dr. Wolf, right now, no secret service has informants in Iraq. As soon as the weapons inspections are over, the CIA leaves with their pens down, right? Retzlaff? That's one way of putting it. Britain and Israel also have no people there but we just got our hands on someone. And we'd like to hear your thoughts as an Iraq expert. Yes. Are you an expert on Iraq? I'm an expert in bio-weapons. Retzlaff, he was there for three years. Do you doubt his capability? Well, there's an informant I recruited who's implying he was involved in an Iraq chemical weapons program or something similar. I see, and you got him from Iraq? No. From the refugee processing center in Tsundarf Mmm, from a refugee center. Yes. He's applied for political asylum and claims to be a chemical engineer from Baghdad. He worked for the government in a building called LCDC. Does that ring any bells? ACDC, like the rock band? I can see you're an expert as you may as well. Guys, let's just watch the video. Retzlaff, do you have the tape? No need, I can sum it up. Retzlaff, the doctor needs to see for himself. Ms. Smith! play the video. It's just boring descriptions. Retzlaff. Let's just watch the video. Thank you. Go ahead Retzlaff, talk. Okay. This is the central refugee processing center in Tsundarf. He arrived two months ago. This is his room with six bunks. That's him? Yes, Rafid Alwan. His asylum procedure will take three to five years. During which he can't walk or leave the area and he knows this. Which means if he works with us he will be one very happy schmuck. Okay? Exactly, this is his initial interrogation. Where are you from? My name is Alwan Rafid Ginave. I am born in Baghdad, Iraq, 3rd of June, 1968. Mr. Alwan, what is your profession? Your job? I am a chemical engineer. I have a diploma from Baghdad university. And where did you work? I worked at LCDC. LCDC. What exactly is that? Where is it? It is. He says it's for design of chemicals. A red building in Baghdad. Could you pause for a second. We have verified the existence of this red building. It's here, but it is called El Caratt and not ACDC. Yeah. LCDC sounds Arabic, but it's an English abbreviation. May I? C E D C. Chemical engineering and design center. And that's been in El Caratt since the 1980s. It's director used to be a doctor Riha Tahar, also known as Dr. Germ. I would say our informant is claiming to be an insider from Saddam's bio weapons program. Yah. Good. I'll start cresting him tomorrow. Yes. Maybe that should be done by someone with knowledge of biochemistry in Iraq. Wait a minute, he's my contact. Yes, but you have no idea what he's talking about. Yeah, but listen- - Dr. Wolf, from now on, you'll be the case officer. What? Retzlaff here will show you the ropes What? End of discussion. He has no idea. He's department 4, he belongs behind a desk. I'm the case officer. Don't insult me here like that. I've made my decision, yeah? The doctor will do it with or without you Fine, whatever. I guess anyone can play James Bond here now. What a joke. See doctor. I'm surrounded by fools, people who'll do anything to get ahead. But you, you are different. You want to go back to Iraq? Don't you? I read your reports. You're absolutely right. The Yanks let Saddam off far too easy, okay? Let me tell you, the chancellery is not opposed to your position, but for something to happen, they need proper proof. I can check out this Iraqi but to be honest, I'm a bit skeptical. The stories they tried to tell us in Iraq were unbelievable. You, be skeptical? Doctor, we're together on this one. Do you know where the box is with all my school stuff in it? No idea. Isn't it time we got rid of mom's things. I'm on it. Okay, I'll be off then. Wait, how's college? We're on semester break right now. How have you been, any new mission? I can't talk about it. You know that. Are you dating anyone? What about the American woman? The one from Iraq. Right. She's in America. Haven't heard from her in ages. All good. I'd better get going. Okay. We'll have tea another time. Yeah? Bye. Last can. Then someone will have to fetch some more. Very demeaning to a case officer. I know, which is why I can't do it. I'm sorry, I don't know the English words. No, no, no, no. Let's wait for the translation. Sorry. It's a really technical term. Something like kernel improvement. Kernel improvement? Yes. Kernel improvement. Seed purification? Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Seed purification. So what you're saying is that you worked at Java Nadar factory doing seed purification. Tell me exactly what you did there. You know, after the sanctions, our people were suffering. So we have to increase, we have to make more of the, the result of the Agriculture. Agricultural results Mr. Alwan, it's common knowledge, everybody knows that your government used seed purification as a cover for something else. How'd you know? I was there. So what did you really do there? This is ridiculous, you're wasting our time. Java Nadiff was a bad place. Okay, no man should do this. Why? What's bad about seed purification? He means anthrax. I know. So. You are saying that you worked with anthrax germs? I am an engineer. Okay, I build the mission. I maintain, maintain machines. What kind of machines? Who is listening here? Where did you find this? What is this? Nobody's listening. You're at a safe place here. Okay? Go on. I maintain diaphragm pumps. What kind of diaphragms pumps? Look, it's a horrible weapon. It's a horrible weapon. It's very dangerous. Okay, I see accident. I see people die. You witnessed an accident with biological material? I'm sorry. He came to look. He came to, to watch, to see the people die and, and he laughed. Who, who came? Rafid, you have to tell us more about this accident. Do you know the Mukhabarat? Iraqi secret service, of course, why? They listen to everything. They know everything. I need protection. I need good protection. I cannot go back to Asurai Time. They are everywhere, everywhere. Okay. We'll protect you. We'll get you out of Asiland Heim. We'll get you out of the refugee center. Mind telling me how? A car would do that, an apartment, a new identity. An apartment. Where's that supposed to come from? Retzlaff, I'm sure department one will manage. Are you taking the sofa inside or are you already on your lunch break? Okay, both rooms. I need the kitchen and the living room with Alwan. The other way round or he will be facing the wall Kitchen. Living room. Can I? Do you like it? It's beautiful. Rafid, we need proof of what you're saying. We need the names of the people who have been there. Names of the victims, anything. I'm sorry Dr. Wolf, I want to help you. Let me ask you, what happens to me when we are finished? If I go back to Iraq, I'm dead. I need the German passport. German passport. Passport? Yes. You can forget it. He's concerned about his safety. Naturalization is a bureaucratic nightmare. Plus we'd have to bare our assets all, just for an unverified informant. No, we'll have to find another way. All of you, we need evidence. He told us about that bio-weapon accident. It really can't be that hard to get testimony to corroborate. I've reached out to my contacts at MI6 in London. There's someone who used to be a very good source for us. Certain Dr. Latiff. He's in Dubai right now. Dr. Basal Latiff? We've checked him. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Yeah. He just parrots the official Iraqi position. All bio-weapons programs ceased in 1993. Information is worthless. Why wasn't I told? it was in the last report, here. Read it. And if we talked to MI6, it must be all through Geta. Oh dear God. This really is an absolute catastrophe. At some point I'll have to hit the brakes or we look like complete barbarians. Wolf, I'm giving you one more week. Then I'll need to see results. Mr. Schatz, about that accident anthrax exposure. You don't get it just as bad. If we found some antibodies in his blood, it will prove conclusively that he worked with the pathogens. Thanks. We could do an antibody test. Come with me. Antibodies. That sounds promising. In there, why didn't you mention this before? The only ones able to do precise tests are the Americans. Well this sucks. The chancellor, he wants to impress the yanks with our work. We can't ask them for help. Definitely not. Besides, once the U.S has direct access, we're thrown out. It's always the same. I have a contact at the CIA. An expert in bio-weapons, we met in Iraq. I could try to get it done quietly. Hello. This is the German bakery, I have some fresh marshmallows. If you do not yet have a ticket for tomorrow we would kindly ask you to collect one from the detention office today. How are you? what have you been doing? What have I been doing? Writing reports, enrichment, fishing for trout in the Patelmic, coming to grips with the fact that the rest of the world doesn't really care about bio weapons. Wow. How did you do that? I'm not like you. I can change my priorities. So, what's up? Les, I need a favor. We have an informant from Iraq who claims to have witnessed an anthrax accident. We want his blood tested for antibodies. That guy came to you. Yes. Why? How do you know this isn't old Saddam fucking with you? Why would he? What if he has no weapons? Huh? What if he doesn't want the rest of us to know how weak he really is? Interesting theory. Why are you asking me like this anyway? Why not just go through the official channels, send the guy over? I can't. Why? My boss fears that you won't give him back. Well, I can't just walk into the office and ask them to test a vial of blood for anthrax antibodies. What am I supposed to tell them? Huh? It's for my new boyfriend. I cannot put my job on the line for this, I'm sorry. Oh my God. You're like a dog with a bone. So, can you please do it? No. Anything else you want to say to me after two years of complete silence? Otherwise, I have things I gotta do. Fuck. My contact can't get the antibody test done, not without an official request. So we're screwed then. An official request won't work. I know it's been a week now but I thought I could maybe crack the Iraqi myself, pay him a private visit. Try the emotional approach. Emotional, huh? Sounds very bold for you Dr. Wolf. What? Why? All right, go for it. Rafid? Dr. Wolf. How are you? I'm fine, thank you. Good to see you. You want to join me? Yes, of course. Please sit. It's beautiful, huh? Yes. Yes. Do you like your neighborhood? Yes. What's wrong? I miss my wife Dr. Wolf. Yeah. You have a wife? Yeah, I had. She's gone. Have you seen this before? It's called "rodeln." "Rodeln." "Rodeln," yeah. You want to try? Me? Yeah. No, no. This is for children. No, no, no, no. It's for grownups too. No. Yes. No. Really. Hold on. What are you doing? No, no, Dr. Wolf. Excuse me. My friend over here, he's from Iraq and he's never been sledding before. Do you think we could borrow your sled? Okay, you sit down. - Here. - Yes. - Take this. - Yes. - Okay? - Yes, yes. And then straight down. Okay? Dr. Wolf, I'm too big. I'm too big, I'm too big, I'm too big. No, trust me - I'm a man. - Dr. Wolf! Dr. Wolf! Bravo! One, one, one more. Yes. That was quite good. Yeah. Is, what is? "rodeln." Yes, yes. Feels so nice, thank you doctor. You know, you, you are a real friend to me doctor. Thank you. You're a friend too Rafid, you know? But I need your help. Of course doctor, anything. I need some proof of what you've been telling me. Like, did they buy any special materials or substances from another country? Or a name. I want to help you and give you this information doctor but I told you before I need protection. Rafid, please trust me. I trust you when I get the German passport, doctor. If you tell me something to confirm that Saddam is still making anthrax, then I'll get your passport. Understand? I promise. Okay, I trust you doctor. Okay, wait. You remember how the UN people always look for bio-weapons in Iraq and they never find anything. No they didn't. Of course not. Now look, you have the water tanks. Yes. And then you have the tanks for the active material, the nutrition broth, the visilos. From there, they go into the mixing tank for bleeding and processing. Yeah. And finally, to the storage tank for the finished anthrax agent. Yes? Yeah. Now look, you take everything and put on huge trucks. It's moving around all the time. Never in the same place, all over Iraq. When it's finished, they go to Java Nadav and unload. But we've been to Java Nadav, there was nothing there. Of course not because when you come, they move. Easy. This is Java Nadav, north of Baghdad. Here in this building, trucks are loaded and unloaded, 40 toners. They enter here, go up the road, reverse, then drive into the building. Right now, seven of these trucks are on the move in Iraq. I find your story entirely plausible. This is just great. Absolutely amazing. Write it up. The report is complete but shouldn't we wait for a validation. For what? Just hearing the word wait brings me down. Doctor, listen to your gut, your intuition. Do you trust your source or not? Dog and his bone. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, woohoo! Desert Fox isn't good enough for you Dr. Wolf. So we used to be the doormat of the CIA for the longest time. Not anymore. Thank you Dr. Wolf. Here, from MI6. Exceptional source. Most side, provide additional information. From the CIA, potential game changer. They've even given him his own code name, Curveball. Oh, thank you. Thanks. And suddenly I'm getting calls from all the Intel agencies. So, and get this, chancellor Gerhard Schroder sends his regard. They want those Stazi files from the yanks. So now they think they have an ace up their sleeve. To you. Cheers. The whole business will open doors for all of us. Now, be honest. Where do you see yourself in a year? I. Go ahead. Think big. You could get a top post. You know, I want to go back to Iraq But there's nothing to drink there, doctor. Yeah. You know, I, I don't think Saddam wants to use anthrax there, he wants to use it here in the west. One terrorist with a spray bottle could wipe out an entire city. Everyone would inhale it like pollen in spring. It starts out like a flu. Difficulty breathing, fever. Hey, there's people eating over here. Wheezing, your brain swells, the lymph nodes in your lungs burst like rotten tomatoes, you cough up blood. Organs fail next. Treatment is ineffective. The outcome is almost always fatal. Doctor, I'm so glad I'm not you. Hey Schatz. Hi Ernst. Don't lie to me, you can't get passports for us. When did I lie to you? I never lied to you. You don't know the risk I'm taking for you. Pause it. Did he just say he was taking a risk? Yes. Okay, carry on. A generation shaped by Vietnam must remember the lessons of Vietnam. When America uses force in the world, the cause must be just, the goal must be clear and the victory must be overwhelming. You want to drink something? Yeah. They have diet coke here, right? Sure. Excuse me, over here. I wanna try currywurst. Seriously? Yeah. That's like a thing here, isn't it? Yeah. All right. Well then I'm in Berlin, I wanna try it. Okay. I'll be hoping when I go home. Hello. We would like a cola light and two currywurst, please. Thanks. So I'm glad you called. What brings you to Berlin? I'm here and I'm, like a delegation thing. It's classified. Yeah, but. Thank you. Thank you. What about Iraq? They say the Bush family might want to finish some business down there. Yeah, maybe. I think they're still like sorting things out. I read your report. Yeah? Yeah, congratulations. You must be quite the celebrity over at the BND now. Les, I want to go back there and just find those trucks. That's all I want. I tested that blood vial. Okay. The one you gave me. I had it checked for anthrax antibodies. And? Nothing. They either, he wasn't there or the whole thing didn't happen. Okay. But maybe it was there and wasn't exposed. Right? Yeah, maybe. I mean that proves nothing. No, it doesn't. Wow. So, have fun. Oh my God. Yeah. This is disgusting. Yes. Looks like an anthrax accident. It tastes like one too. Mmhmm. Oh my god. It's my phone. Are you gonna get it? Yeah. This is Schatz. The Iraqi's gone. He hasn't been home in more than a week. We're launching a man hunt. And where are you? Get your ass here now! Go, get outta here, it sounds important. Salam. Rafid, if you're not coming home at night you have to tell us, okay? This is Germany. Not coming home, it's not normal. Okay? Here, drink. Come on. You are our most important informant. You know that? Yes. And we still need your help. You need my help? You'll get your passport. I promise. What? What's wrong? No, no. Rafid, what's going on? Rafid, come on. Someone's coming. Who? I don't know him, man with a cap. Close the door, close the door. Notebooks, slips of paper, et cetera. All the classic hiding places, yeah. Mr. Schatz, come here please. We can call off the man hunt then. Please. You know what this is, this building? I know nothing. No passports, I know nothing. Passport? And a bottle of champagne to go with it? What's this? Mind telling me what's going on. Java Nadaf, I've already gone over the building plans with him at length. But definitely not this picture. This is from October, 1993. So the exact time his trucks were supposed to have been going there, big 40 toners with semi trailers. Now then, look at this wall right here. Solid, made of stone. How exactly is a truck supposed to get in there? Tell me, you were there. It's a fake. A satellite photo from the CIA is a fake? Highly unlikely. Oh, and by the way, the blood test you asked your friend of the CIA to have done, the Americans sent us the results yesterday. No verifiable contact with biological agents. The only thing of note was a 0.14 blood alcohol level. Yeah, but, this just means he wasn't infected. It proves nothing. Come on, there's more. Sit over there. There you go. We found it in his apartment. That prints out of your report from the 1998 UNs commission in Iraq, freely available on the web. He's marked the passages. Production of biological agents might have been transferred to mobile units like trucks. He literally fed you your own idea. For God's sake, you must have thought about that. I just thought we were right. I had to pass it up the chain. As you can imagine, the chancellery was not amused. They expect hit to row. You'll have to tough this out. I'm suspending you for now. He's admitted it. It's all made up. There are no trucks. Lets go guys. Lets go, move it. Right here, right here. Just stay right here. Here it comes. Tonight we are a country awakened to danger and called to defend freedom. Our grief has turned to anger and anger to resolution. Whether we bring our enemies to justice or bring justice to our enemies, justice will be done. How to change the filter. It's a particularly tight fit. Cynical but true. At Harry Reignar, the technical wholesalers, the anthrax attack in USA has caused growing demand for special safety devices. Fear is great for business. It's become clear recently to the major insurance companies. The first anthrax attacks have now occurred in Germany. Four weeks after the first cases in the USA, the pathogens have been discovered in mail items and. Initial tests were positive. The governments of the effected states are awaiting further reports. A crisis committee will meet at the chancellery tonight. Meanwhile, Rudolphdas job center. This is the federal intelligence service you're calling after office hours. Please leave a message. Yeah. Auf Wolf here. Dr. Wolf, formerly of department three biological warfare. Could you pass on that I'm available. I've just seen the news about, about these anthrax incidents. Maybe my expertise could be of use. Leslie. Good morning. Coffee? I'm sorry, it's a little bit of a mess. It's okay, don't worry about it. Doc, it's okay. Just put it, put it, put it down. Okay? Just put it down. It's okay. I miss you. I'm sorry. Don't worry about it, we're all having a tough time. Oh, I forgot. How did you get along? Okay, because I know we are gonna catch the bastards that did this. Did you know somebody in the towers? I'm sorry. Look, I am prepping a new mission to Iraq and I need you to help me with something. Of course, anything. You still in touch with Curveball? No. Well, he, he invites me from time to time but, I'm not going. Well, I'm not working there anymore so. You didn't know. No. Why what happened? Well, they needed somebody to put the blame on. Sorry, I have no idea what you're talking about. Blame for what? Didn't you read the burn notice? No. What burn notice? There's been a burn notice on Curveball On Curveball, who wrote it? The BND. I mean they, they threw me out. There must be a burn notice. Curveball's story is a lie. There are no trucks. Says who? He himself admitted it. No. But what about, what about your evidence? You guys seemed pretty convinced. Wait. Here, that's all we got. His drawing. This is the evidence. That's a joke. No it's not. Okay, look, I would just feel better if I knew that you were keeping an eye on him, okay? I think Curveball might be a piece of the puzzle. Do you know something about Curveball I don't know? Someone might know something we both don't know. Dr. Wolf, you came. This means you're not angry anymore. Maybe a little bit. Eid Mubarak. Yes, please come in, come in. Take off your jacket. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Please. Come, come, come, come, come, come, come. Everyone, please. This is my very special guest, Dr. Wolf from the German secret service. Yes, yes, applause. Sit down Dr. Wolf. I'll get you a drink, okay? You secret service? We are colleagues. Oh, really? Which country? Iraq. My wife told me to spy out the secret ingredient in biryani. Biryani? Biryani!. Rafid, don't tell anybody about the BND, never. Okay. You can never know who spies for Saddam. These are all friends. It doesn't matter. Think of the Mukhabarat. Stop worrying. Dr. Wolf, they can do nothing anymore. Now I am German, I am safe. To you. Excuse me? What? What do you mean German? Yes, yes. No more Iraq, no more. It's a good picture, huh? What? Why? Because of you. You promised it to me and now I have it. Doctor, thank you. This man, hey, this man, he get me a German passport. Would you leave us please? Do you understand? Out, out, we need to have a word. Doctor, why are you? Who gave you the passport? I don't know, Retzlaff? When? After last time when we met I- - So, I lost my job and you got your passport? You lose? I didn't know you lost your, I am sorry. Are you taking my passport? I don't give a shit about your passport. All I want to do doctor is live a normal life like a normal man. Okay. Okay? Rafid, I don't take your passport, okay? Okay. I promise. Thank you. Thank you. I just have a question for you. An important question. And you have to be honest. Have you ever worked with anthrax? Doctor please. Is there anything you know about bio-weapons? No. No more talking Dr. Wolf. Now we take a drink, I have to check on the meat. Please come join me. Oooh-oh. Why did you give Rafid Alwan a German passport? Why did you fire me and make him employee of the month? Calm down Wolf. Who let you in here anyway? Why in the hell does the CIA still believe Curveball is an active source. Take it easy now doctor, Schatz is your man. We kept quiet about shutting down the Iraqi because that's what Schatz wanted. And believe me, I didn't feel right about it. So the burn notice wasn't sent upstairs? What burn notice? Wolf, you may not have heard, but Schatz is promoted to Berlin. Do you think he'd be promoted if they knew how the Iraqi fucked us over like that? What does that mean? I'm sorry sir, I can't help you. - You have to- - Make a request, of course. Schatz, Schatz, Schatz! We need to talk about Curveball, right now! I am not leaving. For God's sake. You can't make a scene like that. Why do the Yanks still think Curveball is an active source? Why don't they know the trucks are not real? No, what makes you say that? A few days ago, I had a visit from the CIA. They wanted my help to get to Rafid Alwan, imagine that. They have no idea this whole Curveball thing is a total bullshit. The yanks tried to get to the Iraqi through you? Yes. Shit. Mr. Schatz, you forced me to quit my job because of this. But to the outside, you swept it under the rug. Does the government still believe Saddam is still building bio-weapons trucks? Why is there no burn notice? Because of your fucking career? Calm down, okay? And just to be clear, everyone knows it's bullshit, all the way to the top. Okay. So why don't the other secret services know? Does that also come from the top? These are political decisions. You can't understand the ramifications. Right, of course. So you wouldn't mind or care if I informed the press then, hmm? You know what your problem is? You can't get over your own failure, can you huh? Don't ever forget that it was your report that the Iraqi used and that it's your signature on the Curveball file, not mine. Goodbye. Oh, and remember, the whole matter is top secret. If you tell anybody about it, you'll be committing treason. There are a number of terrorist states pursuing weapons of mass destruction, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Syria, to name but a few, but no terrorist state poses a greater or more immediate threat to the security of our people and the stability of the world than the regime of Saddam Hussein in Iraq. Papa? Yes? Don't worry, it's me. Whoa. You still have a key? I was going to leave it here anyways. No, no, keep it. Who knows? Hello. Hello. How are things? Pretty good. Lots of free time. And you, why didn't you call? This was a spontaneous idea. I'm invited to a new year's eve party, it's just around the corner. Oh, okay. I thought I'd drop by. Yeah. Are you expecting visitors? Visitors? Who would come to visit me here? All right. All right. Come on. What the hell? Dr. Wold. Rafid. Come in. Thank you. Can you close the door please? Close the door, close the door. What's going on? This your wife? This is my daughter Meg. Meg, this is Mr. Alwan. Very nice to- - Rafid, Rafid. Rafid. What's going on? The Iraqi Secret Police want to kill me. They would think I'm a traitor, they came to kill me. Please calm down. Papa. Come with me. Come with me for a second please. Meg, I'm sorry. Informants don't usually come to the homes of intelligence personnel. Papa, he mentioned the Iraqi Secret Service. What's going on? Meg, Meg, he's exaggerating. Okay? I'll calm him down. Come with me. I can call the police for you. Meg, please. The man is paranoid, okay? I'll take care of him. Don't you worry. Okay, just go to your new year's eve party. Dr. Wolf. Rafid, I'm coming! Papa. Please don't tell anyone about this. I'm sorry. I don't know anything about you. Rafid. Rafid, she's gone. I don't want my daughter involved in this. The Mukhabarat come to my house doctor and they want to take me. So I run. Okay. But I don't know where to go. Of course. You'll have to calm down. All right? Sit down. Can you hide me please? Of course. Okay. Did somebody follow you? I took the bus for two hours and then I walk for a very long time. I think no. Okay. But you have to calm down. Yes. Yes, of course, yes. Do you have a drink, maybe? Of course. Happy New Year. Happy New Year. You are my only real friend Dr. Wolf. I have to piss. Doctor. Leslie. Leslie. Leslie? Yeah? Oh, thank God. Where are you? I'm on the road, what's up? They kidnapped Curveball. I think it's the Iraqi's. I'm tailing them now. Okay. Tell me what you know They have a black van. They just left the A95 heading towards. Heading towards what? I have no idea what you're saying. Can you spell it? Oh God, yeah okay. It's O B E I A M. It's the highway from Munich going Southwest, okay? Yeah. Maybe they bring him to Switzerland, I don't know. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm okay. Yeah. Okay. All right. Listen, listen to me. We are gonna take care of this. Okay? I will send somebody right now. Okay, but don't you want me to follow? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Do not put yourself in danger, okay? These fucking Iraqis are animals, you know that. I gotta get to work on this, all right? But go home. Get some sleep. I will call you, okay? - Take care. - Okay. Okay, yeah. What's he doing? Slowing down. The car is stopping. Good. Mann, he's waking up. Should we put him out again? No. No, I'll talk to him. Good morning Mr. Alwan. Who are you? We're the good guys, don't worry, we work for the US government Americans. Jerry, get some water. Mr. Alwan, I have something here that will make you feel much better. Here. Yeah, yeah, yeah, for your head, take it. It's good? Yes. I'm really sorry we had to pick you up like this. The Germans were making such a fuss about you. The Germans? The Germans didn't want us to meet you. No? No, they told us you don't like Americans. No, no, I like. Yeah? Good. The US government has a very good offer for you. Yes. Okay. Have you ever thought about living in the United States? Fuck. Damn it! Mr. Alwan, you feeling good? Yep. We want everything to be as natural as possible, okay? So just tell us your story in your own words, just as you are. What do you want me to say, I'm sorry? I am gonna ask you some questions about Iraq and about the anthrax trucks, okay? Okay. Just tell us what you told the Germans. You know, it's been so long time ago so, I don't remember exactly how. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's okay. We actually have something for you. This is a summary of your past statements, okay? This is what we wanna hear. You want to take a minute to look at it before we start recording? Yes. Okay, all right. Take your time. I'm sorry, can I ask? You know everything I say. Yeah, yes we do. Why you want to make a video with me? We are going to broadcast it. You want? We're going to put it on TV, television. Why? Rafid, do you like Saddam Hussein? He is the president of Iraq. Mmmhmm, yeah he is. But is he a good president or is he a cruel dictator? He. Okay. What happens to people who disagree with Saddam? Are they free to say what they want? - No, no, no. - No, no. Be a good thing if someone were to get rid of Saddam. You want to get rid of, but you cannot get rid of Saddam. Why? Because Saddam has much power, you know? The army, the secret police, the Republican guard. And you don't think the United States could win in Iraq. I don't know. But the more people that are with us in that struggle, the better the chances are, right? And that's why we wanna make this video with you. We need everyone to know that Saddam has terrible weapons and that it is very important that we take those away from him. Ma'am. Yeah. Sorry for the interruption. Somebody is approaching the premises. Oh Jesus Christ. Hang tight guys, I'll be right back. Dog with a bone. Rafid is under German authority. You kidnapped a German source. No, we didn't kidnap him, we borrowed him. Oh. Man, I'm just doing my job here, okay? Question is what are you doing? I thought you were retired. What do you want from him? What do we want? Come on, he's a fucking one trick pony. We want the anthrax story. But why? It's a proven fake, you know it's not true. Jesus Christ. You are so stuck on the truth. Truth doesn't matter. Justice, justice matters. And that gives you the right to twist the facts? We make the facts. Go home. Mr. Alwan, before we go on, I'm gonna need you to swear that the testimony you're about to give is the truth the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. To do? I need you to swear. Ah, to God. Even better, whomever you like. Yes. Hey, come back! Fuck. Rafid! Rafid, come on! Sit down. Okay, okay. Let's go, let's go! Yes. Doctor. What do we do? What should we do? Take the van, go find 'em. Rafid. Are you okay? Doctor. We made it. Are you sure? Yes. Yes, we escaped the CIA. Go, push harder! Fuck. What? - No. - What? Doesn't work Okay, let's try again. Come on. Come on. Come on! Fuck. Watch out, watch out! Shit. Yeah. We lost him. Ah, shit. All right. Come back, we'll regroup here. Let's move out. Hook up the satellite feed for me. Okay. Sir, we lost the asset. It didn't work out but I think I might have a viable plan B. Yeah, we're sending it now. What do we do now? We can't go home. We need a hotel. Oh fuck. Belt Unbelievable. Come on, you can't be serious. I have the right to call a lawyer. Tell me why we're being held here. Hello? What's going on here? Talk to me. Good God boys. It is new years. Normal people are with their families. Yeah, you should file a complaint so the CIA can only abduct sources on working days. Oh right, the humor expert. I remember. Rafid, wake up. It's time to go home. Go home. What? That's it? You can't take him home. The Yanks know where he lives. Don't worry doctor. He'll get a new place. Dr. Wolf, what about you? Right? What about me? Other colleagues here will call you a cab. Oh no, Dr. Wolf! The story works. Can you clean it up a bit? You don't think it's too simple? Simple is perfect. People love simple stuff. Participants are urged to speak for not more than seven minutes. The purpose of this meeting is to hear a presentation by the United States. I call now on the distinguished Secretary of State of the United States of America, his excellency, Mr. Colin Powell. Thank you Mr. President. Mr. President, Mr. Secretary General, distinguished colleagues, this is important day for us all as we review the situation with respect to Iraq and its disarmament obligations under UN security council resolution 1441. Let me take you inside that intelligence file and share with you what we know from eyewitness accounts. We have first hand descriptions of biological weapons factories on wheels and on rails. The trucks and train cars are easily moved and are designed to evade detection by inspectors. Ladies and gentlemen, these are sophisticated facilities. For example, they can produce anthrax and botulinum toxin. In fact, they can produce enough dry biological agent in a single month to kill thousands upon thousands of people. The description our sources gave us of the technical features required by such facilities are highly detailed and extremely accurate as these drawings based on their description show. Papa what's the matter? Papa? We know how they And we know a great deal about the platforms on which they were mounted. The source was an eyewitness, an Iraqi chemical engineer who supervised one of these facilities. He actually was present during biological agent production runs. He was also at the site when an accident occurred. It's Prime Minister Fischer, say something please! This defective is currently hiding in another country with a certain knowledge that Saddam Hussein will kill him if he finds him. So, do you remember the Iraqi from New Year's Eve? They're talking about him. The story is fake. Are you sure? Yes, of course, I know it. The United States will not and cannot run that risk to the American people. Leaving Saddam Hussein in possession of weapons of mass destruction for a few more months. You must go to the press. Hello? Is your father at home? Papa. Papa! Dr. Wolf, come with us please. You will be working for a sports shoe manufacturer in Munich. Here, but you don't really have to go there. It's just for, it's just on paper paper. So you don't have to go to work. You'll get 3000 euros every month without work. I mean, that's not bad, huh? For me? Yes. You have to sign here. I don't have to work? No. So what I have to do? Nothing, you do nothing Just keep out of sight please. No talking with journalists, no talking with anyone. Okay? Okay. Rafid. If you talk, we take it all away. Yeah? Hello Dr. Wolf, the desert fox. How are you feeling? Like shit. And you? You two, wait outside, yeah? Please, sit down. What do you want? Did you watch the UN meeting? Wouldn't have happened if Curveball was burned. Then you don't know the Yanks. We can't admit that one of our own sources was a lying scammer who was bullshitting us for two years. I see, and why not? Doctor, try to see the political context. There's going to be a war. Chancellor Schröder clearly stated that Germany is against the war. But that's also the problem, you see? What? I don't get it. We're working our butts off to limit the damage. What damage? To transatlantic relations. The US is starting a war based on a lie and you're worried about transatlantic relations? Doctor, the Yanks are starting a war anyway, whether we like it or not. So, you have to look to the future. What happens after the war, huh? And what if the Yanks do find something? Where will that leave us, huh? You said yourself that these bio-weapons are somewhere in Iraq. Now come and sit down. Here, your new job description, if you want it. Top salary. You're still the best bio-weapons expert in the service. Sooner or later, people will be needed down there. People who know where to look. I'd feel a lot safer if you were one of them. And I'm not the only one in the building who thinks that. Understood? what is truth? Yes, an illusion. But what do we become if we stop searching for truth? Why have laws on news reports? Why have elections? The truth disappears and nobody seems to care.
