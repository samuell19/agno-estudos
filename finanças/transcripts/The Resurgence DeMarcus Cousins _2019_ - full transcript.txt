I'm like, "Man, there's nobody in Alabama 6'7", 6'7"." Coach Danny fell in love with him as soon as he got out the car. And when she stood out the car, she's a tall lady herself. DeMarcus stood out. Seemed like he'd never stop standing. I said, "Oh, my God," you know, "I won the lottery." He was a big kid that I didn't think had any talent. [laughs] He missed all his layups. He didn't just develop his basketball skills. He also was there to teach the boys what it was to be the best person you could be, and that's how their relationship started.

[Isaiah] I think the best coach he had was obviously Mike Malone, 'cause from day one, he respected him. [Michael] There were days where we butted heads, and I went after him. He brought the best out of each guy on the team. [Michael] He wanted that coaching, he wanted that discipline, and I think that's why, when I got there in that first full year, DeMarcus just took off. [man] He slams in the face of Lopez! [Michael] We had a-a confidence, a-a swagger about us in year two. We're defending. We have an identity. Our guys have bought in. Our fans were out. They were supportive. They finally had a team that they believed in and could be proud of, and it was all cut so short. [Isaiah] And then they fired Mike Malone, which-- it made no sense, because for the first time in years, it seemed like they were going in the right direction. That coaching match seemed to work, and all of a sudden, the franchise fires him earlier in the season against sort of the feelings of their best player. [woman] Kings firing, of course, head coach Michael Malone last night, the most-- well, the move definitely a surprise for everyone involved. The Kings are currently 11 and 13 on the season.

[Rachel] Boogie missed a couple games because he had viral meningitis and they end up getting rid of a coach that he had connected with so much. My biggest regret when I look back upon my time in Sacramento is, I'll often wonder what would've happened. Mike Malone was the guy that he felt, like, understood him, that he could rely on what he was gonna say, that he was gonna be there the next day. That's what he appreciated so much about Coach Cal. That's what we have seen worked with DeMarcus throughout his life, which works with so many players.

Um, I was sick to my stomach, literally, um, for a lot of reasons. It just, um-- it's like one of your children, and something happens like that. ♪♪♪ For me to watch, it was painful. I was in the box when the injury occurred. I thought it was something minor. Coach Gentry was down there with DeMarcus, and he was hugging DeMarcus, and he had tears in his eyes, so I was like, "Okay, what's going on?" You could see immediately that something had happened. I was concerned that it might have been his-- either his calf or his Achilles had-had ruptured, 'cause he went down so quickly and so immediately, and I knew something was wrong. ♪♪♪ To have something like this happen so dramatically and so suddenly, it was very depressing and very, very upsetting for him. It kind of just wanted to bring you to tears, 'cause when he grabbed his ankle, I could just see it all in his face. It wasn't a-a face of pain, like, "This shit hurt." It was a face of pain like-- like, "Why? Why now? Why me?" And I seen DeMarcus get injured before, and I would watch him go to the sideline. If he can walk, he'll play. But when he had to be helped off, I knew then that it was serious. The emotion that he plays with on the court, it's been used against him, but there you saw it. He literally sacrificed his body for something that-- in the grand scheme of things, that ball goes out of bounds, so what? Seeing DeMarcus get hurt, the news went around really fast. I mean, you knew what it was right when it happened. It was just--it just sucks when things like that happen to good people. He was well on his way to all-NBA first team. He was well on his way to a supermax contract. To this day, you always wonder, what would the Pelicans have been if DeMarcus was still healthy? [ominous whooshing] [Richard] I'm Dr. Richard Ferkel at the Southern California Orthopedic Institute. I've been practicing 36 years here. This is an Achilles tendon, this is your heel bone, and the Achilles is formed by your calf muscles, so all muscles join to bone by tendons. Your calf muscles merge together and--and are joined together on this tendon, and that's what does the work. This usually would be a very, very difficult injury to come back on, because of his size. You look at all the people that have torn their Achilles, they don't come back very often. I mean, this... it's a weird injury, bro. [man] But yeah, I read all-- I mean, I definitely put--I definitely give it its respect, 'cause, like, it's taken motherfuckers out. Achilles tear is no joke-- like, this is an injury that can--can kill careers. I-I heard it all after he got hurt. "Will never be able to come back," "wrecked his career." Nowadays, I think that's an-an outdated type of-of way of thinking of things. Certainly, it's a difficult injury to come back. It's a lot of recovery, a lot of rehab, and you have to really be committed and work incredibly hard. He believes he can be that same player. You know, I think that was always the belief that he had. [indistinct chatter] Hey, hey! Oh, shit. What's up? [Anthony] It was tough. Like, for me to see him sitting there, knowing that we headed to the playoffs, we in the right direction to get in the playoffs, and he's not going to be able to be a part of it. [indistinct chatter] 200. - You owe me $200, though. - No, I don't. That--those ain't count. - Fuck, no! - Man... 200. Y'all see this, right? 200. That's cool. - We even. - No, uh, that's four. - You already owe... - That's four. You already owe me two, so we even. No. This for--this for you to be up two. No, this for me to be up four. How? You already bet the two right here. All right, fine, I'll take $200. I ain't tripping off that shit. - [laughs] - [DeMarcus] Oh, man. It was cool, man. It was a cool feeling, being around the guys. It definitely put me in good spirits, and I was glad I was able to see the guys this morning. My teammates, they-- they've let it be known that they want--want me there. I just can't say that about everybody. Been a rough morning. Bullshit came out on the Internet. "DeMarcus [indistinct] down and out." I understand it, but... He's a max player. He'll be just fine. Just roller coaster of emotions. It's tough. Just hate seeing him this down. [man] Yo, what's up, man? So, I had a conversation with Boogie. - That's crazy. Fucking crazy. - [man] So... No, not at all. Pelicans are up on Portland in the playoffs in 2018, but in the background, what really was looming was DeMarcus Cousins' free agency. That was what was going on behind the scenes in the spring leading up into free agency. So you have DeMarcus Cousins coming off an injury, entering your free agent summer. Uh, question marks abound. "Where am I gonna play? Who am I gonna play for? Am I gonna recover from this injury? Will I be the same player?" Who was willing to make a long-term investment in him? Who was willing to bet on him? What's my next step? What's my next plan? It's chess right now. You know, it's... it's a lot of mind games, a lot of manipulation. It's...it's chess. [Michael] When you go from being this close to achieving so many things that you've been wanting to achieve, then it's just taken away from you, you have a choice. Are you gonna feel sorry for yourself, or are you gonna say, "You know what? I'm not gonna let this keep me down. I'm gonna get up and I'm gonna fight." You think he had a chip on his shoulder before? Well, it's even that much bigger now. ♪♪♪ [John] You know, the greatest thing is, it basically is in his hands. ♪♪♪ How did he even stay sane? How did he not go crazy? [DeMarcus] Back then, it was like, I don't know how the hell I'ma get through this, how the hell I'ma do it. ♪♪♪ I know where I want to be. I know where I want to get back to. I know what type of player I want to be, and I'm not settling for an injury to determine who I am as a player. I determine my worth. I won't let an injury do that. ♪♪♪ I've been through so much adversity. If I sat there and dwelled on those moments, where the fuck would I be right now, you know? I don't need anybody feeling sorry for me, like... I've been told my entire life I wasn't gonna be shit. The next person's opinion or words don't matter. You know what you're capable of. At the end of the day, it's gonna take commitment and dedication to reach whatever it is you're trying to reach. ♪♪♪ [Rachel] You don't have to speculate on how people thought of him. You can just look at what happened in the summer. So you're going into July 1. You're looking at the list of teams. There are less than ten teams with salary space really to sign you as a free agent. The list is just shrinking for you. You're seeing free agents go off the board, sign with teams, take money. [Rachel] You had 30 teams with the capability of making an investment in the DeMarcus Cousins business, so you have to wonder, who is betting on him? Is he the only one? Is he just betting on himself? [man] You got it. - [man] We doing 30? - [DeMarcus] Yep. Come on. It's that first step. How many you got left? - [DeMarcus] Three. - [man] Two. Come on. Come on, one more. Awesome, and rest. So now... [Scott] Being DeMarcus is a free agent, it's not like he can sit back and say, "You know, I got a contract." He's on his own, and he's, like, on an island. He's gotta hit it hard, he's gotta show that he's better than what people think he is, and so that's a lot of stress on him. [DeMarcus] This is my first free agency, on the market. I never expected to-- to be like this. I-I thought it would be, you know, a walk in the park, but, uh, I'ma maneuver through the bullshit. Uh, I'ma find my way, like I always do, and I mean, at the end of the day, I know I'll be on the court, playing the game that I love, eventually, so we'll see what happens. I think the reason why all the teams passed on him, more than the injury, was because of his reputation. [DeMarcus] We reached out to the teams, the Pelicans. Pelicans had no interest in bringing me back. They didn't even give me an offer. You know, we reached out to some other teams. We got answers like, "We don't believe it's a f-- a good fit," or, "We gotta see what we're doing with our roster right now." Like, just kind of-- just bullshit answers, and then there were some just flat-out, like, "We can't take that risk." Okay. Abs. Yes. [Michael] Is there a perception out there? Are there some franchises or teams or coaches that may be scared of coaching a guy like DeMarcus? Maybe. You know, I-I can't speak for those people. There are definitely some guys out there who say, "I will never have him in my organization." [Matt] I think the teams just didn't want to risk the DeMarcus Cousins they think they know. You know, liability is, I think, a really negative word, and one that I would never place upon DeMarcus as a man and as a player. [man] That's it. Keep going. Keep going. And stop, good job. There you go. [DeMarcus] I like that. I got a nice little trick up my sleeve. It's a shocker for sure. I got a nice little plan up my sleeve. ♪♪♪ You got the Woj Bombs. Then you got the Boogie bombs. Nuclear warfare. And I got more of them. [laughs] Telling you, it's gonna fuck you up. [man] Who, me? [whistles] ♪ dramatic music ♪ [DeMarcus] What's up, Steve? How you doing? Doing well. I'm just leaving the gym. Like I said, I had a lot of time to reflect. I had a lot of time to kind of prepare for this. [Shams] There's no deal with the Lakers. There's no deal with the Pelicans. Both teams are-- are not in the picture for you. Do you continue to wait it out? Do you wait till July 6, July 7, July 8? I'm willing to make this work. I want to win. I want to play at a high level. I want to experience that. We've been preparing for this moment. We knew what the market would do. We knew our chances were kind of slim. We knew this injury would play a big part in decisions and, you know, teams and their choices. My heart's always into it. Always. Coach, I will pick teams apart. [Michael] He wants to show people he can help a team be a playoff team. He can be part of a winning team, a championship contender. The Boogie Bomb! The Boogie Bomb! [both] The Boogie Bomb! Knowing the circumstances and the situation he was in, it was probably the smartest decision that he made. 'Cause now he's in control. He's in control. [Shams] Walls were closing in, and DeMarcus really just took this decision into his own hands. Let me call J really quick. Bada-bing, bada-boom. Bada-bing, bada-boom. Oh, this about to fuck everything up. The league is about to be like.... - Just quit. - "What the fuck?" Yeah. This is-- this is my ace of spades. Ha, I bet. This is my--this is my-- my nuclear bomb. A'ight. A'ight. My last resort. I'm a Warrior. [laughter] Whoo! I mean, that's just a mic drop. [woman] With a surprise move, the Warriors agree to sign DeMarcus Cousins to a one-year, $5.3 million contract. ♪♪♪ [cheers and applause] NBA just fucked up. Like, no one took a chance on DeMarcus Cousins? You let the team that doesn't need him to win a championship get him? I mean, it was-- my-my reaction to that was probably like the whole world's. Shit. [laughs] I think my first reaction was I laughed. Wait, hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. This--this can't be true. That can't be right. It can't be that the Warriors picked him up. Golden State was already a great team. Just got a little bit greater. [laughs] Oh, so this really is as crazy as it sounds? Oh, yes, this is nuts. At one point in time, I wanted to beat these guys. Now I'm a part of them. We gonna win together. All of a sudden, we get a phone call, like hey. They said, "You're not gonna believe this one." And so I answered the phone, and Bob's, like, hyperventilating, like, "Draymond! We can get DeMarcus Cousins!" I'm like, "What? What are you--like, what?" We're embracing all of him, all of DeMarcus'-- we need it all. I said, "What the fuck are you calling me for? What are we waiting on?" Ten minutes later, my phone blew up. DeMarcus Cousins to the Warriors, and it was amazing. Fuck the sources. Bet you wasn't expecting this one, huh? Fuck the sources. So there was this idea of "Oh, my God, they're gonna start five all-stars. This is what Boogie can do. Oh, my gosh. This isn't fair." Um, you had a big backlash, even among other NBA players, being like, "Come on, man. You c--you can't do this." I felt like it was much more sort of backlash against the Warriors as a whole and, like, "Hey, man, how is this allowed to happen?" [phone chiming] [Bob] I think the moment DeMarcus Cousins committed to the Warriors, you saw multiple different reactions from fans, from media. Players get criticized all the time. This is a guy that said, "I want to win more than I want to get paid." And I thought it was very savvy, because you are putting yourself in a position to increase your value so much. I say to those people who said DeMarcus Cousins becoming a Warrior ruins the NBA, they should blame 29 other GMs, because they had the same opportunity to go after DeMarcus that we did. Social media and-and all that has made things so negative. It's-it's given the voiceless a voice. You know, and some fans just want to talk shit anyway, so why not talk shit about the best center in the world going to the best team in the world? But if you worry about every little thing that's being put out there and all the negative energy that's put out there, I mean, you'll drive yourself insane. You know, once you're painted as a bad guy in the NBA, that's what you are. It just shows you that people don't do their homework. They see what they see in the media and that's what they run with. My perspective, um... You know, I had haters before. I've just got more now. Do I care? No. 'Cause when you see me... [laughs] You ain't trying to see me. [laughs] Period. You know the truth. You really understand, but you're just-- once again, you're-you're paying attention to everything on the surface. I'm okay with that.
