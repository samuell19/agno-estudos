Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. I was born in my 23rd year. My first breath, just before the war, led to 22 years of what my Aunt called our "afterlife" and she thanked God for every single day. And me... ...I was a good boy. You came from dust. You will return to dust. Let us be righteous to God. Blessed be Him! Say Amen. Our Auntie was a human being. After this life, there is another life. And hope. Amen! But my life was never quite mine. What is mine? Will I recognize it when I feel it? Will it claim my life or set it free? Back to work, dreamer! Tekno! Back to work! Now! Death surrounds us. The worker pays the price, it seems. Metal precious currency. Third and First world currency. Black Market currency. Drum beat, heart beat currency. That old Black-bodied currency. Every martyr - currency. All that you pay not to see. My brother was kind! Tekno! Tekno! He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away. Thank you, Pastor. Yes, boy. The Lord may force us on our way before we feel we're ready. Yes, Pastor. Do not fear for I am with you. Be not dismayed for I am thy God. I will strengthen you and help you. I will uphold you with my righteous hand.

Hack... into land rights and ownership. Hack... Hack... into business law, proprietorship. Hack... Hack... into the history of the bank. Hack... and question the business of slavery, of free labor, its relation to today's world. Hack... ...into ambition, into greed. Into suffering and sufferance. The treatment of one faith towards another. Hack. There's energy in pairing. Once upon a time. Very long ago. We lived on a mountaintop. My mother and father were... binary stars. On the mountaintop was where we discovered ourselves. Our nature. Our density. The visible and the invisible. An awareness indivisible by doubt. Binary crime theory. The give and the take. The heart you must break, in order to open. Eclipse of the senses... The ceremony of smoking. And then there was fire. Fire in the sky. There was day. And then there was light. Fire in the sky. Binary crime theory. The give and the take. Blind fury, contrary. The heart you must break... ...in order to open. There is a way of breaking a heart! So that the blood spills evenly onto the page. A book to be opened. There was day. A story always has a beginning, just as each has many interpretations ...like dreams. Everybody knows when the sunrise. See it dawn in their own eye. Die and bloom in a season. Everybody knows what the folks call reasoning. On a distant planet where the reason landed and the folks transparent. Fourth dimensional libations granted. No turning back... Everybody knows when the sunrise. See it dawn in their own eye. ...and the folks transparent. Fourth dimensional libations granted. No turning back... The Motherboard is bleeding. The Motherboard? Deo! This is the moment. Unanimous Goldmine. The power of the subconscious is honed through guidance. Sense the connection. What birth has severed, love will reconnect. Oh, Motherboard. Light years. Eight planets out. Light years. The hopeless desperation that I felt. Picture a dream and dare to live it. Open your soul and dare to give it. Consumed by woes and daily fears. Rebels are posing, no one dares... ...to crush the desperation that is felt... ...when you live in doubt. The Motherboard?! Picture a dream and dare to live it. Open your soul and dare to give it. Consumed by woes and daily fears. Rebels are posing, no one dares... ...to crush the desperation that is felt... ...when you live in doubt. People above the moon. Here's what happens next: breath. Maybe you're asking yourself WTF is this? Is it a poet's idea of a dream? The web of awareness bore down through me. What blossomed as understanding had been planted in years of confusion. Everybody knows when the sunrise. See it dawn in their own eye. Die and bloom in a season. Everybody knows what the folks call reasoning. No turning back. Everybody knows when the sunrise. See it dawn in their own eye. Die and bloom in a season. Everybody knows what the folks call reasoning. No turning back. Everybody knows when the sunrise. See it dawn in their own eye. Die and bloom in a season. Everybody knows what the folks call reasoning. On a distant planet... ...where the reason landed... and the folks transparent. Fourth dimensional libations granted. No turning back. Yeah, I'm a sound man. I build systems of sound. I've always felt and built from memory. I dreamt and saw a wheel like Ezekiel. He said, "Sound holds memory." I walked here. Then you arrived... ...and you said your name is Memory. The war forced us into other dimensions... ...where the worst had already happened. A new idea blossomed... ...with greater awareness. Elohel, birds are living witness. They fly through portals where pain is the only passport. Matalusa! Unanimous Goldmine. You slept all day. The journey was long. So you slept well. Dreams, man. It's all we talk about these days. You want a beer? Is it warm? Yeah, I haven't figured how to get power yet. It was like this when I found it. Then Memory got here and now you... What is this place? It's like another dimension. We choose dimensions like cities to live in. Man don't choose. Woman choose. So, what did the Wheel-Man say to you? "HACK." And after that dream, you walked here? I just kept walking. Tekno... his heart was in the stone, coltan... ...the power in the Earth. He walked and dreamt with that power. I walk to understand. How's it? Shining. Say what? Unanimous Goldmine. Zingaro and beer. Hot or cold? Cold. How's it? Shining. Say what? Unanimous Goldmine. The mountains have not awakened. Their fire is our breath. The sunlight does not burn the ground. It nurtures every step. May I? My name is Innocent. I'm just passing through. From where are you traveling? I am traveling from death to other passageways. Ah. You came from the capitol? The university? The Authority's henchmen are everywhere. Why do you think it's so? It can't just be the election when we already know who will win. And what the police did at the university. Is that any way to treat the future leaders of a nation? Bon appetit. Breaking your fast? Forgive me. The journey has been long. One who swallows a whole coconut trusts his anus. What's wrong with the television? Oh sorry. I'll check the satellite. Why don't you let me pay? We walk out together and you can pay me back outside if you wish. Okay? If I am just born once in a lifetime, who am I to make things up? I count the stars but will they count me? Who am I to lift them up? "Who am I?" the soldiers ask me. "Who am I?" ask the police. Who am I but a reflection... ...of that uniform beneath? I was born on a forgotten day! But I own the night! Are you running from something? Not exactly, yet I can assure you... ...whatever we are running from is running to us all. If I am just born once in a lifetime, who am I to make things up? I count the stars but will they count me? Who am I to lift them up? "Who am I?" the soldiers ask me. "Who am I?" ask the police. Who am I but a reflection... ...of that uniform beneath? I was born on a forgotten day! I was born on a forgotten day! But I own the night! I own the night! Unanimous Goldmine. I'm sorry to frighten you. Unanimous Goldmine. Ca va? Are you okay? I'm sorry. I thought I was being followed. Your baby! Rastafari. Unanimous Goldmine. Is it safe here? Not safe enough to find your mind games funny. Sister, I apologize. I ran from the capitol, the university. This mind game has saved my life. I will keep going if it makes you more comfortable. No. You are safe here. What's your name? My name is Psychology. When I left the capitol, you could already feel it. The tension. It's more than tension now. Violent rhetoric from The Authority had to lead somewhere. First they cut the radio. Then they cut the television. They locked down internet. Then locked up the opposition. Underwhelmed by the attempt. Overall what else is left? Underscore the over-paid, whose bed is already made. And I'm underground. We hid in the library... ...of the university. Under "O" for oligarch. Under "P" for patriarch. Undermine the underground. Under siege, complete surround. Chana... Chana, is that you? No, Sister. Chana was my mother's name. My child, where did you come from? I had a friend named Chana. She was very close to me. She had a baby just before the war. A little boy. But we were separated before I had the chance to meet him. Your mother the same way, before the war. She stayed inside some days, before the war. Remember when she froze before the door... ...just like you froze out in the garden. And she was my best friend, before the war. She always knew what we were destined for. She always questioned... ...what made hearts harden. Something invisible, hardly predictable. Yearning to be my pleasure, your pleasure! And if there's an ounce of forgiveness in me, I'll make it rain songs that their children will sing. All that I know is real. In the end, I will heal from what happened before the war. How's it? - Shining. - Say what? Unanimous Goldmine. Look at my phone, is it charging? No. There's no power. But all these things seem to connect to something. Who built this place? It was empty like this when I arrived. It's a strange feeling, like being cut-off from the world... Which world? Mata! Mata! Look! Mata! Mata! Look! Tekno? You see! We power the system. It is the same energy that flows through us. Tekno! Time held a mirror and reflected a world of parallels... ...of fear and longing, with no sense of belonging. But that dissonance became a song in me. What should have destroyed me... ...what attempted to gender or "boy" me, ...set me free. Hurry up and away! They'll tell your story how they want to tell it. The algorithm of the sun and moon, where the planets were when I first saw you. I knew invisible was visible now! And then you told me... the words were spinning 'round like yellow leaves. I saw divisions of labor... the cultures... Beware! Your kind's not welcome here. Mata! Did you think we wouldn't follow? Tekno was our little brother too. But how did you know? The dreams we began having after you left. Tekno's dream. Tekno-color. Tekno vision. Mata! Tekno always shared his understanding of the rock. Unanimous Goldmine! Tekno taught us what we were mining. These are my friends. These are my brothers. Unanimous Goldmine. From the mine? Yes, we worked with Matalusa and Tekno. I don't miss the mine... ...but the music! The miner is everything! - Dig! The miner is everything! - Dig! The miner is the power source! - Dig! The miner is the power source! - Dig! The miner is everything! - Dig! The miner is everything! - Dig! The miner is the power source! - Dig! The miner is the power source! - Dig! Alone but not alone. Alone but not alone. Alone but not alone. The miner is everything! - Dig! The miner is everything! - Dig! The miner is the power source! - Dig! The miner is the power source! - Dig! Mining is music. Make a wish. Power! Where's it coming from? I was plugged in. I felt the power coursing through me. Through my dream and now here, I was where I was meant to be. React. Retreat. Subtract. Delete the beat. This is an observation deck. Onward. It is spoken. Holy Roller. Bare foot. Brown Dirt. Foot stomp. Hand clap. Groundwork. Mata, Ca va? It's all so much. I lost my brother a few days ago and now I feel like I'm in another world. Where are we? Martyr. Loser. This is Matalusa Kingdom. Chosen leader of the tribe-less Neither/Neither... won't be Either/Either, son of Nonesuch, bewitched by the Queen of... Anger. Self control. Tolerance, to and fro. Wisdom. Ecstasy. Memories of her history. Neither/Neither... won't be Either/Either, nor the brown dirt. Foot stomp. Hand clap. Groundwork. That is one way of telling a story. Is this the interface? This is a dream. And you are? Dreaming. Not I. This is Matalusa Kingdom. Martyr Loser? I'm no King. I mine coltan. Unanimous Goldmine. Unanimous Goldmine is the greeting of the resource rich who face a world beholden to the currency of our depletion. This golden salute elevates the vibration of metallic injustice to the threshold of planetary sustenance. When I beheld Matalusa, the greeting took on new dimensions. I attempted to speak but was struck by the millions of conversations streaming through me... An influx of information. Code, streams of light, virtual lanes of traffic became more legible... ...data... I was Moses on the mountain top. The burning bush was a firewall. Encrypted messages on a tablet. We won't be silenced, no, the noise came from here. Your never ending war will not be waged from here. The future is my home, it all came from here. Police and sirens, guns are on parade right here. You'll never touch my love. The bullets in your guns, you know we paid for it all. Your scriptures severing tongues, you know we paid for it all. With oil and our blood, you know we paid for it all. We won't be silenced, no, you know we paid for it all. The bullets in your guns, you know we paid for it all. You'll never touch my love. You know we paid for it all. You'll never touch my love. You know we paid for it all. You'll never touch my love. Unanimous Goldmine. Unanimous Goldmine. This is Memory. Memory, this is... Neptune. Matalusa! Can you believe it? How did you do it?! I have no idea. Unanimous Goldmine. Unanimous Goldmine. Met this girl on Friday night. Rocky Horror Cinema. Cuban stogie. Karaoke. Purple satin bra and tights... That's what I was wearing. She was wearing red and purple light. White smoke. Had bright hopes. Straight man with gay ghost. She passed, in topaz, we brushed hands, I took note. Sankara for the vote! Women, keep your head up. Girl. Boy. ACAB toys. We broke the code. Let's make noise. Girl Boy Girl Boy Girl Girl Boy Girl! Girl Boy Girl Boy Girl Girl Boy Girl! Girl Boy Girl Boy Girl Girl Boy Girl! You can't change the code, they say. Ca c'est pas ecrit, they say. Tudo mundo nesse mundo pense com me ils veux, they say. Think Black. Them think Gay. They think like they book say. They think like... They can't imagine if they don't see it in a book. Even when they see it, it's their book that tells them how to look. Think White. They think Straight. They think like they book say. They think like... Met this girl on Friday and I didn't see her in a book. No magazine can tell me how she's supposed to look. Proof of contradictions in the Old Testament. She was once a He, was once an argument against the books. They think like they book say. They think like... Truth is not a theory that can be imprisoned within a book. Words are sometimes prisons, sometimes prisms from the way you look. They think like they book say. They think like... From an outsider's perspective Earth is just split personalities. Split corporations stop monopolies. Split governments take power. Split people take control. I was in control of my instrument, on a dance floor, free of fear. Thus it is said: I was born in my 23rd year. Beyond the firewalls, cyber-security, encryption, I am a bird flying high... ...over a mountain of data seeking the answer... ...to the question that wings ask. A sea of information coded in spiral. My operating system gives the unsaid instruction to move a limb, or lift a middle finger. Elohel, didn't you call this place Martyr Loser Kingdom? What? You have I-fi? Humble genius. We all have I-fi. Everyone has I-fi? Elohel, how did you do it? What did I do? Look. Not the signal. The content. Woke up in the morning high off the internet! Five million followers now on the internet! I own the internet! I own the internet! I own the internet! I own the internet! Hack into religion. Five billion followers. Bitches, slaves and Indians. Five billion followers! Five billion followers! Five billion followers! Five billion followers! Martyr Loser Kingdom, Roach Egg Economy! Spread like superstition, Roach Egg Economy. Roach Egg Economy. Roach Egg Economy. You're awake. How's it? Shining. Say what? Unanimous Goldmine. Matalusa, you've inspired a world wide trend. What does that mean? It means Neptune has found a way to capture the world's attention... ...and we're the most talked about thing on the virtual face of the planet. '...THE MYSTERIOUS HACKER MARTYR LOSER KING CONTINUES... ' Can it be traced? From what I see, most are looking at Russia or China. And what can you see? It's not what I see but what I see through. Matalusa and I shared a dream that led me here. A vision. But what I see here... ...is a gateway? Have you met Frost? We haven't met formally, but I believe we are acquainted. Matalusa, you look like you've seen a witch. No, Memory. They called my mother a witch. I see the dream of my brother, Tekno. My father learned the word technology from a man selling knives. The man said the blade would never dull because of "technology" and my father fell in love with the word. When the war began, Tekno was one and I was six. We hid in the trees and didn't make a sound. I fed, washed and took care of him. After the war, purveyors told us the land had been sold. We could leave or work the mine for room and board. When I asked what they were mining, they said - "technology." I saw it as a sign, so we stayed. Finally, you're safe here. We're not safe. The gun, the prison, the system enforces our automation and suppresses the human spirit. And you see what they see? I see... Makers of diseases. Down For Some Ignorance. Chemicals and feces. Down For Some Ignorance. Computers delete us. Down For Some Ignorance. Don't care how they treat us. Down For Some Ignorance. Fresh on the streets and I'm down for some ignorance. Fear of defeat and I'm down for some ignorance. Stock holders meet and they're down for some ignorance. Frère of the meek and we're down for some ignorance. Matalusa! You have to see... 'CHINA AND RUSSIA... HAVE DENIED RESPONSIBILITY' '...ARE CALLING THE GREATEST BREACH OF THE VIRTUAL AGE' What is this? It's you? Matalusa and Neptune have a connection and their connection is connecting us. My friends! Technology was the name of my brother... And it's Technology that guides us today. They use our blood and sweat to communicate with each other, but have never heard our voice. Until Now! We are miners. We do the work that is hidden behind their screens. Coltan distributes power through the motherboard. Our Power! Say it! Yes! We have no authority, but maybe now we have a voice. And vision! A voice to say to The Authority, No! We are not down for your ignorance! Hell no! Brothers Gone! M-Windows On! Sisters Gone! Google On! Nobody knows I'm not alone Tell them I need somebody. Coltan Gone! All cars On! Mountains Destroyed. iPhone On! Nobody knows I'm not alone. Tell them I need somebody. Division On! Solution None! Conclusion War! Happiness Gone! Nobody knows I'm not alone. Tell them I need somebody. Malaria Home! Material Not. Familia Pauvre. But guess who comes home! You think I don't know that you're bad and wrong? Welcome Mr. Nobody! You're wrong and you're still doing it. You're saying that my country's a bad deal. I'm the boss but the deal is on me. You betrayed me and then you're rich. So fuck Mr. Google. Fuck Mr. Google. Help me understand, one more time. Machine learning. Decode a system empowered through practice... ...that's mistaken for practicality. Try to make it practice something different. Crypto-Colonial debt in the red. Command/Control Democracy. I think she's saying that what's more important is what can be done, what can be said. Neptune has been generous in sharing her experience but even she's not clear how it occurs. And I appreciate that. But on this continent we have always been cloaked in anonymity like the hidden face of God. We are not hidden. We are ignored. We are not ignored. We are unloved. We are not unloved. We are sacrificed. We are not sacrificed. We are murdered. They exploit the worth of our existence. We're worth the value of every mineral. Threads of resistance. We mine but don't own what we dig. We "cast the first stone" for their penny. Who shits it, eats it, and pays for it with their life. They cut the cost by exploiting us. They cut the cost on oil through warfare then fuel their armies. We fuel the machine. The engine is the colony. The master and the slave. The hardware and circuit-board. The programming is the same. Maybe you should take her back to rest. Come. Twist them horns around the neck of each equation expanded upon multiples of death. Memory stored in a cloud. Terabytes in C-major. Here is the invention of the astronaut. First Nation sweat ceremony in a spaceship. To imagine hell is privilege. And with each kiss bio-dynamic... ...in direct correlation to stars & seasons, the ability to calculate distance, harness power, stem cells, erect mobile mansions capable of... ...projecting destruction at greater & greater will, what could be keeping us here? MYSTERIOUS HACKER MARTYRLOSERKING CONTINUES TO ELUDE AUTHORITIES WHILE BREACHING ACCESS TO HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF SMARTPHONE USERS ACROSS THE OCCIDENTAL WEST. THIS RAISES OTHER QUESTIONS FOR THE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE INSPIRED BY THE ACTIONS OF MARTYRLOSERKING, ...WHICH MANY GO SO FAR AS CALLING "POETIC" The Martyr Loser King. Memory! These are games! It changes nothing. This is poetry! Why not issue an attack? Crash the market. Erase debt. Transfer the colonial debt d'independence. Reveal arms sales. Expose corruption. Hold estates ransom. Why not make a demand? Most mining companies have headquarters in Toronto. Psychology... we feed weapons manufacturers. When we take away the hand that feeds, what do you think we face? Weapons. We power systems more effectively than we destroy them. Sharing thoughts, critiques, meditations, poetry. It can help impart understanding. Understanding is all that is missing. We dance between targets of understanding. Boycott misery. Recognize the pattern in the coding. The black bodies floating in space, in the Mediterranean, the bottom of the Atlantic... and beneath us. They're the same Black bodies, mined and mining. Mined and mining... What is mine? The Authority wants to control the spirit of the people, make us robots. Work without question. Work without pay. This village robot... ...is dependent on human spirit to come to life. One justice algorithm. One little Black girl algorithm brings it to life. Innocent? This is Innocent. He's my brother. Now what? Wait for the rest of the army to show up and arrest us for conspiracy? I'm going now. Going where? If a soldier's here, the army is right behind. It's too late. When they cut my arm, they left me for dead. A woman and little man healed me and pointed me in this direction. I'm not running anymore. If it's over, it's over. We harm nobody here. What did you do? I didn't know. How could you not know? Has disguising yourself in the uniform of a soldier diminished your sensibilities? It was The Motherboard. I didn't know. Did you need to know? Was gender so crucial to your desire for intimacy? Are you justified in attacking strangers who do not fulfill your unwarranted desires? You wanted the world and now you've earned it. I asked you to stay on the path with me. And you refused. Now I must insist that you leave. But what about...? Now. It's not what you think. I avoided thinking for as long as I could. My brother is not The Authority. He is not a soldier. The uniform is a disguise. Why? Because they were born boys and raised to uphold an idea of themselves... ...that will not sustain them. Because the laws of attraction... ...are greater than their laws, said and unsaid. Because they are priests at their own funeral. How's it? I thought you were leaving. Where'd the soldier go? I sent him away. Now what? I need to speak to everyone. Elohel, go wake Matalusa and The Motherboard. Motherboard? I'll explain. Just get them. No, we won't leave. We have to fight. We don't have to leave. How's it? Shining. Say what? Unanimous Goldmine. It is no secret, the movement of the clouds, it is no secret, the song of the whales. It is no secret we fly overhead eyeing mass movement, stories woven through generations. We are generations. Witness and song-bird offering voice and wingspan to torrents of wind. Water sprouts from unseen regions above and below. Here is our testament: We see you. Shortcomings and downfalls. Babies born, the miles you travel to feed your family. We see your indiscretions and violent acts. We see it all. There is a deeper hunger... ...to see an end to needless war. We are hunted and honored, targeted and tethered, and through it all, we have survived. But greater than survival is the wisdom of ages applied to the present. Potential openings for new possibilities and greater and greater harmonies: Birdsong and wind-kiss... If ever we learn to communicate with our spirit... Why do you sing this old song when the soldiers are at our door? Yeah, what happened to your brother? There are no soldiers coming. Even if they did, as long as The Motherboard is with us, we're protected. What is this Motherboard? Technology is only a reflection of us. This... is Digitaria, built by the ancestors of the stars: our past and future selves. They built this village as a gateway. Just as we built the drum. Yet the drum is nothing without the drummer. It's time we beat the code. She's not here. What do you mean? When I went to get them, I found Matalusa asleep, alone. I didn't see her leave. What happened? My brother was here disguised as a soldier. Disguised as a soldier? My brother is no soldier. He is Ultra-Magnetic. The Ultra-Magnetic? Your brother is Ultra-Magnetic? I thought he was killed. I thought he left the country. He told me... ...the signal from The Motherboard was traced here. The Authority is working with European and US intelligence to avoid suspicion. So more soldiers are coming. Listen to me! There are people all over the country fleeing the grip of The Authority. Why haven't they arrived here? Each of us has a story that led us here. A story and a dream. The decoding of the dream is through love and music. We must beat the code until she returns, the Motherboard will do the rest. What do you know of love? Of ruins beneath and before? Of fear? I'm closer to birth than I am to death. What is mine? Dreams? I was born in my 23rd year. I'M SORRY. I THOUGHT WE HAD RECEIVED CONFIRMATION THAT THE TARGET WAS DESTROYED... AFFIRMATIVE. THE TARGET WAS DESTROYED. THE TARGET WAS DESTROYED. My truth is encrypted. And yours is easy to read. So what do you need to know about me? That I continue to exist? I am the Martyr Loser King. You build walls but no Fire Walls to protect you from those who burn like candles, whose necks you can chop a million times but still burn bright and stand.
