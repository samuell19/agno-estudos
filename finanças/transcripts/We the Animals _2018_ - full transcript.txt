Look at us. When we were brothers... we wanted more. More volume. More muscles. Us three. Us kings. Us brothers. - Us family. - Body heat. Body heat, body heat. Body heat, body heat. Body heat, body heat. Body heat, body heat. Body... Manny. Joel. Ma. Pops. Me. Manny. Joel! Shh. Sometimes... we wanted less. Less work. Less noise. Just this. Jonah. Come on. What are you waiting for? Wait up! Toss it up! I call first to be on the bed. Shake it, Papito! Come on! Come on. All right, now. Shake it like you're rich. Snobby, snobby, rich, rich. Get those noses up. Shake it! Shake it! You ain't rich. Shake it like you're white. Like your ma. No rhythm. Nah, you ain't white. Now shake it like you're Puerto Rican. Eh! Come on! I met your ma in high school. I asked her to dance. And that's how he got me. I was only 14. Yeah, you didn't look 14. I sat in his lap just like this. And I remember asking, "Can I get pregnant from this?" And he said, "What, this?" And there wasn't no way we could stay in Brooklyn after that. Then out popped Manny. - Boo! - And then Joel. And then you. What time do we got? Look at me. Watching them. Flying. Fearless. You went so far. Was that scary? I'll never let anything happen to you. You grew up with all these lakes and rivers. You got two brothers that swim like a couple of goldfish. How come you don't swim? You don't know how to swim neither. Yeah, well, no one ever swam in Brooklyn. Then where did Paps learn how to swim? I don't know. You ready? You're coming with me. Come on. I got you, bud. - Come on. You too. - You crazy? No, no. You're coming. Come on. - I'm okay. I'm good, I'm good. - Come with me. Come on. It'll be fine. - I got you. Come on. - Okay. Hold on to me. Come on. Hold on tight. Hold on tight. All right. Time to learn. Does that feel good? Hold on. You good? See? You're safe. Hold me tight. We've gone too far. Take us back. He's got to learn to swim. You both got to learn to swim. How else you gonna learn? Huh? I need to talk to your ma. Take your brothers out for a sec. - And do what? - Get out of the car, coño! You okay, bro? You fuckin' baby, him! Goddamn it. He will learn to swim like normal people learn to swim! Did he learn to swim? Did he learn to swim? Why do you have to do this? Wake up! Where's he going? Listen. Do me a favor. I need you to be good and quiet around your ma. There was a, uh... an emergency. Yeah, I had to take her to the dentist tonight. Manny, come here. - Hold on to this for me. - Is she hurt? She just needed some, uh... her wisdom teeth taken out. The dentist was, uh... punching on her a little. That's how they loosen up the teeth before they rip them out. But the dentist said she'll be better by tomorrow. It's my birthday tomorrow. Well... happy birthday, old man. It's his birthday. Happy birthday. He's ten. He'll leave me now. Ten. What's that supposed to mean? When you boys turned ten, you left me. That's what big boys do. I won't. Good. Will you get up today? How do I look? - Purple. - Crazy. Tore up. What did he do to me? He punched you in the face. To loosen up your teeth. You think that's funny when men beat on your mother? Promise me you'll stay nine forever? How? Simple. You're not ten. You're nine plus one. Next year you'll be nine plus two. Like that. Forever. Why? Because... when they ask you how old you are, you'll be telling them that no matter how old you are, you are your ma's baby boy. And if you stay my baby boy, then I'll always have you. You feel that? I remember your heart inside me. Ticking like a bomb. That hurt! Now that Paps was gone... she stopped eating. Stopped cooking. Stopped getting out of bed. Not knowing what's to come, why, that's... that's pretty scary. But I have heard the future. All of you hear the future in a dream. It's God's whispering. Put your hands on your ears and block out the noise and feel the magic of God inside you. We are the magic of God. Us three. Us three. His name, Papito. Your mother smell like pizza. Give it to your teacher for luck, for luck, for luck, for luck, for luck. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. Soy sauce. If you stay still and cool, you won't be hungry. God, I'm starving. Don't answer the phone. But what if it's Paps? - Ring, ring. - Hello? Mami, how come you didn't answer the phone when I call you? 'Cause you sound so ugly. Here try it. - Yo, yo, what's up? - Woman! This is your husband talking to you right now. - You better act right. - What do you want from me? Dígame, Mami, talk to me. I've been missing you. Been missing you real bad. I know, Mami, I know. Ring ring. I'm sorry. Nah, baby, I'm sorry. Hello? Hello? What are we going to do? Come on. Body heat. Body heat, body heat, body heat, body heat, body heat, body heat, body heat, body heat, body heat, body heat, body heat, body heat... Come on. Let's go. Tuck in your shirt. Come on, tuck it in. Divide and conquer. - Can I get a pack of Newports? - Really? What? It's not for me. It's for my mom. You kidding me? You want me to go home empty-handed to my mom? You know what she's gonna do to me if I don't come home with her Newports? - I'm not gonna sell you anything without an ID. -Please. - I'm just gonna walk away and put it in my back pocket. -It's not gonna happen. - Fine, let me have Marlboros then. - Fuck! Jonah! Come on! Come on! No! Jonah, look. Shh. Quiet. Yo, take off your shirt and use it as a basket. Grab as much as you can. Stop! Cut it out! - It's a grenade. - No, it's food. Help out! Damn, why you always telling me what to do? All right, come on. Oh, shit. Jonah! Jonah! You guys hungry? This is my grandson, Dustin. You two boys want to help me? Come on inside. Cut it into a cross. That way you break up the poison and kill the itch. You like Iron Maiden? Who is she? I got to show you guys something. What is this? Locusts. Oh! What the fuck? Oh, my God! Where did you get this shit? Philly. I can get you one if you want. Oh, yeah, I would love to have one. I'm not kidding you, bro. She's got big boobs, bro. Yo, she's getting it. This shit is crazy! Ooh, shit! Whoa, that's nasty, bro. - What the f... - Damn. They keep spinning. Yo, that was fucked up. Nah, that was just fucking. Do you think Paps will ever come back? He always comes back. Shh. Close your eyes. What the fuck are you doing? Nothing. - You touch my bag? - No. You're so fucking weird. After she got up... he started calling more. What if he's having a heart attack? What heart? I'll get it. Ring, ring. Manny, come on. Try. Come on. Come on! Don't move, don't move. Stay still. All right, all right. This is the best haircut you're gonna get in your life. We'll see. What did you say? Nothing. Why did you leave? Your Titi Milly called. I had to... I had to get back to the city. Why did you come back? What do you think? Come on, get up. We're both working tonight. You're coming with me. Now that Paps was back... he wanted more of us. More of her. Hey, Papito, come here. Come here. Get in. Switch it on. Duro, duro! There you go. More family.

How many fuckin' kids and a wife? - Uh-huh. -This truck that doesn't even have enough seatbelts to protect your family. - This fucking big-dick truck! - Okay. Okay. - Big-dick truck! What's wrong with you? - Okay. Okay! - Why you got to get something like this? - You win! You win! You win! You win! I hear you! I hear you! You win, okay? You win! You win. You win. I'll take the truck back tomorrow, and I'll... I'll trade it in for a fucking... minivan. Get you a fat-old-lady car. Huh? Is that what you want? To be a fat old lady? But tonight we have a truck. Okay? So tonight we'll go for a ride. Yo, move over. I gotta pee. You all going to be men soon, huh? We're gonna need to get some new boys to take your place. Yeah, that's exactly what I need in this house: more men. Hey. Where'd the boys go? I don't know. I guess they disappeared. Okay, stop. Come on. The boys are watching. Oh, I thought you all disappeared. You were supposed to look for us. I guess I found something better. Papi. Could you get my boots out of the closet? Oh, baby. Please? I'm already late. Hey.
