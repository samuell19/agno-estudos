[instrumental music] [blows whistle] [music continues] [male narrator] It was a mighty gorgeous sunset. It was truly a beautiful sight. All the friendly, small house tops of Whoville glowing bright in the changing light. All the Whos who lived here in Whoville paused and smiled as the sun sank down and the purple shadow of Mount Crumpit crept across the farmlands beyond the town. It was a mighty peaceful sunset until old Josiah happened to sniff. sniff sniff sniff And he whispered to his wife.. Mariah, will you also take a whiff? And Josiah and Mariah double-sniffed. [both sniffing] [male narrator] And they said.. [both] I wonder if.. [male narrator] But they really didn't wonder. They knew it was terribly true. They knew that the sour-sweet wind was coming back and what the sour-sweet wind would do.

[instrumental music] [rattling] [male narrator] While Max was obeying his master's command in the cave of Mount Crumpit's bleak peak the sweet-sour wind swazzled over the land. And in the home of Josiah and his good wife Mariah they just stood there and no one could speak. Until finally, Euchariah said.. Grandpa Josiah. And Grandpa Josiah said.. Yes, Euchariah? And Euchariah said.. Grandpa, we've stood and we've stood and stooding just stooding 'produces no good.' The least we could do is find out without doubt 'whether or not the Grinch iscoming out.' And so I suggest, we don't stood here like sticks call the Grinch Alarm Center. Dial area code 5-1-9-0-0-6. [Josiah] Excellent suggestion, Euchariah. Area code 5-1-9-0-0-6. [dial tone] Line's busy.

You're a rather small Who, aren't ya? Well, I do the best I can, sir. Are you really the Grinch? Am I the Grinch? Sorry, sir. I have a slight astigmatism. An optical condition in which parallel rays of light 'from an external source converge or diverge' unequally in different meridians. You know, sir, I like you much better with my glasses off.

[Grinch laughing] So with the sweet-sour wind still a-howlin' now the Grinch was really prowlin', and Euchariah watched him go a-clonkerin', skonkerin', skomkaponkerin' toward the helpless town below. And he thought about Josiah, Mariah, Obediah and Bethiah. He would have to save them somehow. He would have to save the town. He would simply somehow have to stop that Grinch from getting down. And suddenly Euchariah knew precisely what he had to do. Stall for time. [instrumental music] [screeching] And what does the rather small Who want this time? W-w-will you please scare me some more, sir? [chuckles] I-I sort of like it. Look, kid, I gave you the two dollar treatment. 'You're not worth a first class grinching.' '"Am I the Grinch!"'

Put those glasses on and get up here. Y-yes, sir. [snaps fingers] [Grinch] 'Come on.' Come on! 'Closer, Euchariah.' 'That's a nice little Who.' 'Now closer.' Closer. Closer. And Euchariah with a courage he had never known till then Euchariah Who with a courage beyond the courage of most men with the sour-sweet wind a-howlin' stood before the gruesome Grinch and said..

Well, sir, as I knew it would, sir the sour-sweet wind is dying down. - No wind ever blows forever. - So what? Well, sir, according to all available statistics when the sour-sweet wind stops howlin' that always stops the Gree-Grumps growlin'. [Grinch] Yeah, I know, I know. [Euchariah] And when the Gree-Grumps stop their growlin' Punkers pond stops runklin' runklin'. And when Punkers pond stops runklin' runklin' that always stops the Hakken-Kraks from yowlin'. [Grinch] Hmm. [Euchariah] And when the Hakken-Kraks stop yowlin', you know what that stops. Mm. That always stops the Grinch from prowlin'. Hmm. Well, I'll be grinched. Well, I'llbe grinched.
