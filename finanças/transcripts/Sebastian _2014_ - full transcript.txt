What? Thank you. How is she doing? The doctor told me it was a stroke. She's still very weak. He didn't want to tell me more until he got the MRI results. I'm going to get a coffee. You want one? Not right now. How are you all doing? Excuse me, excuse me! There are patients here that need to rest. Please don't make so much noise. Lucia? So good to see you! It's me Bertha. For the final act today we have a surprise guest, colleague, well, I don't know... I see he's a little... Dr. Cough Syrup, I think. He's arrived a little smelly. Let's wash him. He needs a little bath. You have been an amazing audience. No more. Thank you for playing along. Where did you guys get so much confetti? You never told me you wanted to be a clown. I'm not a clown. I'm a nurse. I see you and I can't believe you're back. My mother had a stroke. I know. I'm very sorry. It always gets stuck. Aren't we supposed to do our rounds? I should also check up on my mother. I hope to see you soon. Both of you soon. You forgot this. Move it. Don't worry. She's very strong. Why don't you go home and sleep? I'll stay with her tonight. No, I want to stay. C'mon. Just go. Your flight was long. Besides, I had already planned to stay. Our Bench L & S Yes, it's still there. After all these years it's still there. City hall painted the benches a while back. They wanted to remove the carving, but it was so deep they would have had to remove the whole bench. So they left it. How long did it take you? About six hours. The police kept passing by. Interrupting me. How are you? I have no idea. I'm sorry. For everything. Nothing or no one could have made you stay. You're late. I was doing my homework. Yeah, right. Sure. Put on the costume. Hurry up! We only have half an hour to do this. To do what? I don't understand. What don't you understand? I thought the clowns were only on the weekends. Why me, and why today? Because I say so, because I feel like it. Why all these questions? You don't want to help me? You can go. Really? Yes. But, it's going to be sad because I bought a bunch of trading cards for that album of yours. But I won't be able to give them to you becasue you can't help me. I'm going to look for someone to give them to. Auntie, wait for me. Go ahead. Hi Martha. How are you? How is the Mayor today? I'm well. She looks better. That's what I told her a moment ago. And Sebastian? He's at lunch. Perfect. Really? Yes. We are the clown doctors. Here right next to me, we have Doctor Cure-it-All. And I am Doctor Remedy. We have prepared a little surprise for you today. My partner here has a little number and wants to show it to you. Can we? Yes. I like to fly, and every time I do it I try to go as high as I can and I start to collect stars as many as I can. These stars are my treasure. These stars always help me when I need it. They will help you get better. Let me see. You're very handsome. Nicolas, what are you doing here? What's going on? Weren't you going to have lunch? I just bought a sandwich, I wasn't very hungry. We have to be going, what a pity. There are many patients waiting for us. Oh, how late it is. Let's go. Good bye. Bye Mommy Mommy? He's your son? Yes. He's my son. You never told me you had a son. Now you know. Mrs. Carmen, I'm going to go get your medicine. Are you OK, mom? Yes. Give me some water. Nicolas! Take that costume off and go home. But my auntie... Just go home. How dare you do something like that? And with my son. I didn't want to go behind your back. But Nico has to meet his grandmother. That decision is mine. Not yours. You heard what the doctor said. You know what's going on. She doesn't have... That decision is mine. He's my son. You understand me? Bertha, understand me? I'll see you tomorrow. Thank you. You're welcome. My son. Don't leave. I'll stay right here. What are you doing out there? It's cold, please come inside. Please come inside. What's wrong? I never should've left. It was for the best. It was the best for everybody. You're crying? Don't cry. Men don't cry. Yes, mom. Good morning. Good morning. How is Mrs. Mayor feeling this morning? Fine. Fine. With Sebastian here, I'll get better soon. I don't doubt it. Would you give me a moment? I'm going to take your blood pressure. I'm going to run some tests so when the doctor comes they're ready. Hello. Lalo? Mrs. Carmen. The "gringo" finally decides to visit us. And those flowers? For you. Who else, for Mrs. Carmen. How sweet. How are you? I'm good. Thank you, how pretty. Put them right there in the corner. I should've brought you a box of chocolates instead. Look at all the flowers you have. But yours are the prettiest. How are you? Good. Good, good, good. The family is good. Growing. God willing. Can you talk outside? I'll let you know when I'm done. Sure. Mom, I'll be right back. Well, tell me about you. Are you doing well over there? Are you happy? Yes. Yes, I am. Yes, I am. Look, tonight Juan, Danny and I are going to a bar. We'll be wating for you at the Chinese bar. That place still exists? Of course. It's our hang out. Look at those drunks... Welcome back buddy. How are you? Drink up first. Fill his glass to the top. Bottoms up, like we used to. After so many years. So how are you doing? Good. More or less. How's your job? How are the "gringas"? Good. Is it true that they're all whores? That they ask you to fuck them from behind all the time? And you? And your girlfriend? She left me for Lalo. That's not true. You know I'm married. C'mon, tell us. Tell us about your work. Chef at a restaurant. I like my job. A lot of clientele. That's why you're fat. I have to taste what I cook. You have to cook us something. It's a deal. Sure. Look at this guy going bald. You would understand. You son of gun. You don't know how to sing and you don't know the lyrics. It was his idea. He does know how to sing and he does it well. Don't you remember when we were kids? It's not a good idea, we better go. Nobody's going anywhere. Nobody moves until she opens the window. C'mon man, the musicians are already here. The neighbors are going to wake up, be quiet! Fuck it! Just do your thing. Good luck. With feeling. Sing well buddy. Don't ask me to forget about you because it's impossible because my soul is engraved with your footprints footprints that now are only memories Are you kidding me? Oh, God. You left me the fruit of your Spring He's an idiot. Idiot. What are you all doing? You have no shame? Help me. Help me! Let's put him on the sofa. C'mon Sebastian. Forgive me. I'll deal with you tomorrow. Who would've thought that puking would bring you luck? You're gonna fuck her tonight. Don't start. Don't start! Please. Is that why you drink? Behave Sebas. What an ugly drunk! What's going on mom? Nothing's going on, Nicolas. Go back to bed. I'm not going anywhere until that man leaves. His name is Sebastian. You saw him at the hospital, remember? Well, he's going to have to stay because he's too drunk to go home. That's not our problem. He has to go! Nicolas, go to your room. What if he's a thief? What if he robs us? What if he takes our things when we're asleep? Don't complain later... Go to your room. I'm not going to repeat it. I won't go to sleep until you come upstairs. I'll be up in a minute. Nicolas, stop that! Good morning. We showed up here last night, right? Everybody was drunk and woke up my son. I'm sorry. I can't remember the last time someone serenaded me. Thank you. You're welcome. I'm making breakfast, want some? I left you a couple of aspirins for your hangover. Bathroom? Straight to the right. Don't you remember? You shouldn't have bothered. You want some juice? A little. How are you feeling? Hungover. What an ugly drunk. I'm sorry about last night. Are you making an omelet? With tomato and onion. I saw Nicolas' photo in the hallway. He's big. How old is he? Eat this right away, before it gets cold. How old is he? Want some coffee? Tell me. How old is he? Are you crazy? How could you keep this from me? Lucia, answer me please. For you. I did it for you. What do you mean for me? What are you talking about? You know exactly what I'm talking about. Or did you forget why you left? You had to go, right? I kept quiet so you could leave. So you could be free. You're selfish. Selfish? He grew up without a father. I've been both for him. Me. Nicolas doesn't lack for anything. We have to tell him. No way. He's my son. We have to tell him. Are you going to stay? When Carmen gets better, are you going to stay? Because if not, I forbid you to tell him anything. You're Nicolas, right? You're the drunk on my sofa, right? Yes, it's me. I'm sorry about last night. Shouldn't you guys be in school? Ah... We just had a field trip with our class. And where's the teacher and the other students? At the museum. Yes. Yes at the museum. We've already been there before. That's strange. When I used to skip school, when I was a kid, I used to hang out around here because I knew no one would see me. Well, I'm leaving now. I'll stop by the museum and say "hi" to your teacher. I'm sure I'll recognize him. Wait. It's true, we skipped school today. But you used to do it too, right? Yeah, but that doesn't mean it's right. Lucia thinks you're in school, what if something happens to you? It's dangerous. Why do you care so much? Just don't do it, ok? Yeah, yeah sure. I'm going to get a juice at the market, do you guys want one? Yes, yes. Nicolas, you want one? No, thank you. I pass. C'mon, let's go. Let's go. It's only juice. You'll see, you won't regret it. You have to try this. It's very popular. Really? I grew up drinking this. For real? I want to try it now. You never tried it? I can't believe it. Nico! Is that kid your friend? That's not my friend. He's a faggot. Yeah, he's a sissy. Why do you say that? Because he's a faggot, he likes men. You shouldn't say that. The juice isn't going anywhere. Relax. My mom is waiting for me If your mom is waiting for you, then you should go. Let's go, Luis? Let's go. Bye. Take care. And stop skipping school. Is this yours? It's nothing. I do these when I'm bored in class. They're very good drawings. Thank you. At the end, you're not as lame as I thought. Bye. Bye. Where have you been all morning? The doctor saw your mother. What did he say? That the MRI results look good. Starting tomorrow you can take her home and continue her treatment there. That's the best. Many patients get depressed if they stay too long in the hospital. That's good. That's very good. Yes, what a shame! And that guy they call Chucky. He's such a stoner. He smokes with Katerine. But Katerine looks like the Virgin Mary. Only on the surface. That's the Mayor. She's here, she's here. Let's go, and please keep it together. I'll go first. Mrs. Mayor. It's nice to see you feeling better. Only God knows how much we've prayed for you. Yes, a lot, Mrs. Mayor. I'm very grateful. Mrs. Mayor, is that your son, Sebastian? How grown up he is! And very handsome. It's been years since we've seen you. I don't know if you remember us. I'm Micaela. And I'm Maria de los Angeles. I'm Amalia. Of course I remember you. It's good to see you ma'am. Miss. Of course, my apology. Tell us about your life over there. I'm sure you've broken many hearts. No, I'm sure he's married and has beautiful kids. Stop, stop don't be nosy. I'm sure he'll tell us when he gets a chance. If you will excuse us. I'm very tired I need to rest. Can we go? Excuse me. Yes, yes, we understand. Rest well, Mrs. Mayor. I will continue praying for your recovery. How rude. Mrs. Mayor looks awful... It feels good to be home. Do you want to lay down for a little bit? No, let me stay in the chair. Mom. Guess what! What? Guess! You know I don't like to play these little games or guessing games or surprises. Ok, I'll just tell you. I'm going to cook something special for you and Martha. How does that sound? But Martha is here to do that. To cook. Yes, and she cooks very well. But you know I'm a chef. And I want to make something special for you and Martha. But I prepared something for today's lunch already. You can save it for tomorrow, can't you? I don't see why this is neccessary. Mom, let me. It's for you. That's fine. You're making me pretty. You were pretty already. The doctor said that you should move a little. I do my exercises. This is better than exercise. Remember? Remember we used to dance to this. Dance with me. You see, I'm moving. Step by step. You're moving good. My sweetheart. Mommy. You want to tell me something? I've missed you. Me too. Me too. You're still the best dancer But my leg doesn't move. Use your hips! Slowly, slowly. Let me get the door. Coming. I'll get it Martha. Martha, please give my mother her pills. I'll be right back. Hi, how are you? Can we have a room please? Yes, of course. Rooms are $14 and $17 with a bathroom. Perfect. One for $17. Your I.D. please. Let me register your name. One moment please. Two beds, right? No, we're married. One bed please. Two beds are fine. Two beds. Are you sure? Yes, I'm sure. Here. Down the hall and to the right. Sure. Thank you. Danny? Yes, that's my name. How are you Sebastian? You had fun with your friend? What did you say? I mean, who's your friend? You're the Mayor's son, right? Right? Yes, I am. This is Josh. He just arrived from Los Angeles to visit. Pleased to meet you. I have to go to work. I'll see you later. Hello sweety, how are you? Are you ok? Yes. Where have you been? I was taking care of some things. Mom, I would like you to meet somebody. But honey, don't be rude. Say "hi" to Lucia. Lucia was nice enough to bring us tamales. They're delicious. Oh, it's nothing. We're going to eat them right now, we're warming them up. You said you wanted me to meet somebody? Yes, the thing is... I'm Josh. Mom, this is Josh. I told you about him over the phone. Are you feeling better, Mrs. Carmen? What is this? What's going on Sebastian? Why don't you go to the dining room? Serve the tamales. Also, there's fresh juice. Go on, I'll be right there. Sure. Lucia! Go with them. What did he say? He asked if you made them. No, I bought them. He likes them a lot. He wants to buy more. Yes, I've noticed. Where are you from? I'm from Oklahoma. He's from Oklahoma. He just said it in Spanish. Sorry. What? He's a lawyer and he lives in Los Angeles. Your work? Where? In a hospital. What? Sorry, sorry. Nurse. Nurse. That's how you say it? He asked if you like it? Yes, a lot. Where did you two meet? Translate. A parade, we met at a parade. Your mother wants to speak with you. Sure. I'll be right back. Close the door. Come, sit next to me. I don't want to receive visitors today. I don't want to see anyone. That's fine, Mom. But, Lucia was here when I arrived. I'm not refering to her. Josh only wanted to know how you're doing. He travelled from Los Angeles only to see you and me. He was simply concerned. Why do you do this? Can't you see how sick I am? I'm fed up. I'm tired. Why don't you understand me? We made a deal that I give you money to go far away from here. Or did you forget? You promised me you wouldn't embarrass me with your lifestyle. But, no. You decided to get married. And you have the nerve to call me to ask me to come to your wedding? This was not our agreement. I'll never forgive you for marrying that man. Be a homosexual if you want. But far, far away from here. Maybe that is the reason I had a stroke. Maybe it's all your fault. Josh is only here for a couple of days. Get him out of here. I don't want to see him. If you want me to get better, make sure he goes far away from here. Why? Why what? Why do you push me away? Why do I always have to be far away to feel close to you? Martha! Come get me out of here. Bring me my pills. My blood pressure is up. The tamales are tasty, right? You knew about this. He told you everything before he left. Yes, I know he told me everything but... I always thought it was just sexual. But... But, what? What's going on? He loves him. He loves that man. This is chicken with extra fries. Hey Juan, what's going on? Hey Mister, I don't want anything anymore. Cancel my order. Why, I made it already? Cancel mine too. What happened? I have yours right here. These people gross me out. Get out of here, you're scaring the customers away. What did we do? All we want is two sandwiches. I'm not going to sell it to you. Just leave! I'm not going to sell you anything. Just leave! Please, only two sandwiches. We didn't do anything. Just leave or I'll call the police. You're still mine, mine, mine I'm still yours, yours, yours Because you have left in me Your footprints You're still mine, mine, mine I'm still yours, yours, yours Because you have left in me Your footprints This isn't that kind of party. Get dressed. I used to dream that I was a man. I used to dream that I would turn into a man so he would want me. I would've been a man for him. I'm so fat. If you're fat, what am I? Move over bitch. If not, I won't fit in the mirror to show you this. This is... This is a real belly. This is a real belly of a real woman. Look how I wound up after my pregnancy. I'm grotesque. I'm full of cellulite. I have more cellulite. Look, I'm full of cellulite. C'mon, look at my cellulite. I'm going to get a breast reduction. For what? You're crazy. They're too big. So they look like mine? No, they're too tiny. Hey! What the fuck... We're beautiful. Did someone hit you? Yes. Did you deserve it? Yes. Can I see it, please? I don't think it's a good idea. You forget that my mother works in the hospital. I've seen worse. That's a punch! Well, now you've seen it. I have to go. Wait, wait. I'm sorry you got punched. But, if you don't mind, can I draw you? Draw me? Like this? I don't think that's a good idea. Please, it will be fast. If you let me draw you I promise I won't skip school for... Two weeks. Not two weeks, two months. Two months? Ok fine, two months. Deal? Deal. It's very hot today. Oh, there they are. That's why she had a stroke. Her son is not only a pervert, but he's married to another pervert. They're going to go to hell. Aren't you ashamed? Spreading rumors behind someone's back. Who do you think you are? You're all going to burn in hell for being spiteful. This coming from a woman who had a child in sin. What did you say? You're talking about my son? At least I know how to be a woman and a mother you fucking spinsters. Ladies, please. She is on that pervert's side. Yes, I'm on his side. If I hear you talking like that again... Crazy, crazy woman! What happened to your eye? I fell down. You fell down? Where? It's not important. Son... I'll give you what you want. As soon as you get better, I'll leave. That's not what I want. I only want that man to leave. That man? His name is not "that man". His name is Josh Cooper. He's a laywer just like you. He has two sisters and one of them just made him an uncle. He likes to accumulate frequent flyer miles and staying in bed on Sundays reading books. He loves apple pie and green tea. But, you know what is the most important thing about him? He loves me. That's enough. I don't want to hear any more about this. Lucia was pregnant when I left nine years ago. What are you saying? The kid in the hospital. Your grandson, Nicolas. Why didn't you tell me before? I just found out. Now you know the truth. What a mother does is cooking, sweeping, ironing. Look at this faggot drawing his boyfriend. What the fuck is your problem? That faggot and his husband stayed at my parent's hostel. Dad says he'll kick them out. Take that back motherfucker. Whatever you say faggot. Fight! Fight! To the principal's office! Are you ok? You get out of here. What happened? You're a faggot, that's what happened. Why are you saying that? What have I done to you? I'm not gay and I don't do the things they say you do. What things? Who said that? Carlos from my class and the Principal. They say you're a pervert. That you and him sleep in the same bed, and that you want me to be like you. That's why you always talk to me. I thought you would behave better after our last talk. Why did you suspend Nicolas? What's going on here? Why are you barging into my office? Why did you suspend him? You have no right to question my decisions. You're nothing to this child. Get out of my office. First explain to me why you're telling Nicolas that I have indecent intentions. People see you two in the street and they talk. People like you shouldn't be around minors. Ignorant. People like you feed homophobia. Don't disrespect me. You have no rights over Nicolas. He's my son. I have every right. If it wasn't for your mother, Mrs. Mayor, I would've called the police. Get out of here! This doesn't belong to you. How was the test? Good. How are you? This must be Miguelito. He's big. Yes, he is. I'm sorry, we have to go. Go wash your hands, lunch is almost ready. What's wrong? You're a liar. Why? You told me my father was dead. Your friend Sebastian says he's my father. I don't think it's a good idea ma'am. You're still very weak. Just help me. I want to see him. Be with him. Look at his little stars. Alright, let's go. Mrs. Carmen. It's good to see you out. Thank you. If you'll excuse us, we're in a hurry. What's the hurry? We've just come from Mass. We have prayed a lot for you. Yes, a lot. Yes, yes, thank you, but we have to go. We also prayed for your son Sebastian. He needs it. He's a tormented soul. Tormented soul? The whole town knows his defect. Defect? To lay in the same bed with another man. It's a mortal sin. And he married him. I'm terrified to think of how God will punish him. That's enough! Don't you have anything else to do besides worry about other people? Nosy old hags. You can't talk to us like that. You're nobody, you're just a maid. This maid is going to smack you if you don't leave us alone. Help! What are you doing here? Nicolas found out but... Bertha called me, your mother was taken to the hospital. They're trying to stabilize her. Don't worry. I want to see her. You can't. Let me see her please. You can't. The doctors are with her now. I'm her son. Let me in please. Calm down please. It happened so quickly. They're afraid it might be another stroke. How do you feel? Tired. Very tired. I'll call the doctor. I don't need a doctor. I need you. Do me a favor. Whatever you want. Tell me about the wedding. Your wedding. I missed it. I wasn't there. It was on the beach. There weren't many guests. Only Josh's family. And our closest friends. We all wore white. Barefoot. Josh's sister married us. There was a little jazz band that played our favorite songs. When the sun set we were married. Our father, who art in heaven Hallowed be thy name... I'm so sorry. Thank you. Look at me. It's better that you leave. They might see you talking to me. I know I deserve that. I don't care that everybody judges me. But I never expected this from you. You can't be so open about it. This town is not ready for this yet. It's not fair to us... All the boys wanted to be on the soccer team. Remember? But I wanted to play volleyball. All my friends wanted to be lawyers and engineers, including you, but I wanted to cook and do theater. I didn't choose to be like that. I wish somebody would have let me choose. I always wanted to be like you. Like all of you. Blend in. Disappear. But I couldn't. I couldn't. That... That's not fair. Nicolas, open up please. I'm sorry but, I can't lie. Or pretend to be something I'm not. Not even for you, son. He didn't open the door. What did you expect? We bought our plane tickets. We leave tomorrow morning. I set up an account to cover Nicolas' expenses. If you need anything... We don't need your money. I love him. I know. Have a safe trip. Don't worry. I'm going to take care of the house as if it were mine. It's yours. I want you to have it. What? Can I sit? It's taken. It's not taken. You can sit. You want everybody to talk about us? He's our friend. Let them talk. Let's go. Fucking faggot. Yes Danny. Yes, I am. I'm a faggot. But not because I like men. But because I let you and people like you insult me, push me away from my family and away from here. If you get any closer... No more! Never again. Fucking faggot. Let's go, Danny. C'mon Sebas. Sit down. Sit down.
