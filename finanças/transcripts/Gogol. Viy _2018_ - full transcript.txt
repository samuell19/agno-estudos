A FILM BY EGOR BARANOV Devised by ALEXANDER TSEKALO Are you there, my sweet? Written by NATALYA MERKULOVA, ALEXEY CHUPOV Wait, don't let Father see us! Why worry about that old fool? I will marry you regardless. Fate is harsh to us. Father shall soon leave for Mirgorod to find me a rich husband. Does he want to feel the force of my fist? I will let no-one have you. I'd sooner die than marry another. Father's looking for you, Bogdana. Don't get caught. Where are you headed, Darinka? I'm going to the fields to bring Fyodor his supper. Don't stay out too late, sister. I'll try my best. You'd better! Oh, who's talking! Bogdana! - Where the hell are you? - Leave quickly. Who's that looking for trouble? I'll show him trouble, the scoundrel! Like flies to a honeypot. Fyodor! Φιόδορο I've brought you supper. Thank you. May I sit with you a while? BASED ON THE WORKS OF NIKOLAI GOGOL Fyodor, when I am 17, will you ask my hand in marriage? You surprise me, Darinka. Who needs such an ugly husband? I do. Will you kiss me, Fyodor? Hey, where are you going? Stop. Hey! Stop! Fyodor, wait. I'll come too! Stop! Stop there! Where did it go? Let us run! Darinka! GOGOL: VIY (Out) CHAPTER 3: A BEWITCHED PLACE Maybe you should. What's all this? I thought that a person of this rank like Yakov Petrovich would hide something more interesting into this chest. All I see are some papers. These papers may shed light on the investigation. 6 AUG, 9 SEP 22 SEP, 2 OCT. Paraska's ears are small here. Her ears were bigger than that. Nikolay Vasilyevich, what do you think. What does this mean? "Twelve plus one..." Perhaps there's some kind of system. Look, here are the four dates when the rider killed the girls, and one more date: October 2. And October 2 this, this is the day after tomorrow. Guro died before Paraska, but somehow he was able to predict the day of her murder. Hence, most likely, according to his calculations the next kill should happen... on October 2. Why that date? October 2 is the feast of the Intercession. CASE FILE: NIKOLAI GOGOL CONFIDENTIAL I had a calendar here somewhere. One moment... A holy feast... So, the first murder took place on July 20. July 20 - the feast of St. Elijah. Then August 6... August 6 - Apple Feast Day. September 9 - the Harvest Festival. September 22 - the Autumn Equinox. Feast days abound. Perhaps that is the system. The rider kills the girls precisely on holidays. Mother always said to be on your guard on feast days, evil spirits rage, and their strength increases tenfold. It all fits together. Four feast days, four murders. There are 9 more this year, for a total of 13. So Guro believed there would be 13 victims. And that they would be killed certainly on feast days. Remarkable. This means we may definitely can determine when the next killings will occur? It would seem so. Rest, O Lord, the soul of your servant... Father Bartholomew! - We are cursed! - What happened? Basavryuk returned… Again? This cursed sinner ... O Lord Jesus, may the devil burn his mustache. All my condolences. I am sorry. Forgive me, O Lord. - Hey, lady! - What do you want ? - Who are you? - Christina. Where's Γκάνα? Oh, your Γκάνα is dead. I replace her. I'll be damned. I come here to see a beautiful young lady and get someone crumpled old lady. Alexander Khristoforovich he is devising such wicked deeds. Perhaps, God willing, you could, as you say... isolate him? And for what. Should I isolate him? But., But ... but it is evident that he is a demon. His face is all dark and wrinkled like an empty pouch. And why should I detain him? Because you dislike his face? Look at your own. We cannot allow his dog-like snout to touch Christian souls. Right, for the last time, we do not arrest people for having dog-like faces, or throw them in jail. We have laws. This is Russia. Master, a young man and a maiden wish to see you. Come in. What brings you? My younger sister Darinka is missing. She brought Fyodor supper in the fields, then vanished. - Help us, for mercy's sake. - You're from the capital, after all. I am sure your sister is alive. But... we don’t have much time we need to hurry. Let me help you. I can bring people together to look for her. Let us turn the whole forest to find Darinka. - No. I must first report to the master. - I'll do it myself! I see I was light on the whip, you little wretch! I forbid you to approach her. You understood? I am a free Cossack. I know what I need to do. I will never give Bogdana to a beggar such as you. And I keep my word. What I said will be forever. Father, don't swear. Petro helps to search for Darinka. Mr. Gogol can confirm. Good Lord. I'll pay any price for Darinka. Just find my daughter. I will do everything is in my power. If something needs to be done, just tell me. Very well. You see? There are serious people on the case. Now get back immediately to the hut! Learn some manners! Master, he is like a bear. I couldn't stop him. My apologies. Lisa. Lisa. Nikolai Vasilievich. I do not know where to start, but... I feel I'm losing my mind. Leave Nikolai, he is mine. He is laid to me by fate. Step back. Otherwise, it will be worse for you. Nikolai, what kind of girl was that? Or rather, is she real? But she talked to me, and... I don’t understand. I ... I'm really losing my mind. Lisa... You see, this girl, she... exists. But at the same time, not really. I don't understand. Do you know her? Yes. She is the drowned girl. Sometimes she appears before me... as a ghost. - A ghost? - Yes. Why did your ghost coming to me? I do not know. You probably just passed your visions onto me, and we are both going crazy. It's the only explanation. And this, your ghost is... Very beautiful. Beast... Beast... Beast... Beast! - Where is the girl? - Beast, beast... - Is she alive? - Beast... What kind of blood is on you? You are not injured. Where does the blood come from? Perhaps some animal attacked him and Darinka in the forest. I think this bastard is referring to himself. Answer me. What kind of beast? Alexander Khristoforovich, surely you see he cannot speak! You do not see his condition! Do you have a better suggestion? Well, I am listening to you carefully. We need to equip people to search the forest and its environs for the girl. I wonder how it turns out. When every time a peasant girl will disappear, I will send the whole detachment of Cossacks in the forest, right? Yes, the whole village is at your disposal. Ask them, they won’t refuse you! Darinka. Darinka! Darinka! Where are you, sister? Daughter Darinka! Darinka! Daughter Darinka! Sister answer me! Darinka! Hey! Darinka! Not me you're looking for? Why are you here? Do not be angry. You asked me to teach you control your gift. So here I am. So then... Shall we start the lesson? Why did you visit Lisa? I forbid you from bothering her again. Am I being clear? I see now that I’m not a couple to you. Boys once chased me in droves. Am I no longer so beautiful? That's not what I meant. Of course. I don't wear elegant dresses like your Lisa. All my riches are leeches and mawks. Goodbye, I won’t bother you anymore. Neither you nor her. And master your gift without me. I just want you to stay away from her! - I... - And do not come to my pond anymore. - Or I will drown you. - I. I didn’t mean it. Oksana! Nikolai Vasilievich. Are you well? Yes, yes, everything is on... Everything is fine. All here soon. God rest her innocent soul. No. No. No. No, Father! Stay away from her! I will kill you, you beggar! Why did this happen today? The feast is the day after tomorrow. Could Guro's predictions have been wrong? And my theory about the feast days has proven to be wrong. As the ancients said. Humans tend to make mistakes. Well, that clears everything up. Darinka was brutally murdered, and Fedor killed her. I would not rush to conclusions, Mr. Bing. Doctor, has alcohol blinded you? Here is the blood, here are the remains. What else do you require? This is not human blood. This is not Darinka. It is an Ovis aries. What the devil is that? A domestic sheep. As you can see, Mr. Binkh, I can still tell human entrails from those of a sheep. What are you saying, then? Someone right here butchered a domestic sheep. You do indeed know a sheep's guts better than a human's. You should switch to livestock. You, sir, are a churlish fool. Put it on your hands. You shouldn’t be so. Dr. Womgard Leopold Leopoldovich is a master of his craft. A Master? Well yes. A master of gutting corpses. But he cannot operate on the living. He fainted sooner than pulling my tooth. Had to go to Mirgorod. It's the rider! He did all this set up. Darinka is alive. He wants to kill her on the night of the Intercession. That was quite a day, Nikolai Vasilievich. Anyway... it's getting late. I shall go home. Leopold Leopoldovich, why can't you operate on the living? Is that churl already telling tales about me? Once in St. Petersburg, I operated... on a child. The operation failed, and the child died. I stopped operating after that. I want no other person to die under my knife. Did that satisfy your curiosity? You... are a good doctor. You should not bury your talent. Yes... Yes. CASE FILE: NIKOLAI GOGOL Gogol Nikolai Vasilyevich. Born in Poltava Province in 1809. One of six brothers, two of which died in childbirth. Three died in infancy, and only Gogol, the sickliest child, remained alive. "The mystery of birth". "A dark one?" You can cross the threshold into this world. This is your gift. The blood of innocents, by the hand of innocents, the den of the beast. Autumn flower. The blood of innocents, by the hand of innocents, the den of the beast. Autumn flower. Autumn flower! Oksana! Oksana! Oksana! You're a fool to return. I said I would drown you! I won’t cope without your help. I don't know... How could a simple water nymph serve you? Do you know anything about the autumn flower? Why do you need this flower? I don't understand it yet. It's the blood flower. It blooms once a year. On the night of Intercession under the Moon at the bottom of the ravines. In those places where gold is buried in the earth. Its petals are the color of the innocent blood. Only an innocent person can pick this flower, and uncover its hoard of gold. You are quick. But to obtain this gold from the earth, the innocent must spill another innocent's blood. This flower is better forgotten. How did you learn of it? I do not know. I see it in dreams and visions, but I cannot explain it. It is beyond me. Teach me. And what do I get for it? What is my reward? Kiss me first. What? Is it Lisa? Then get Lisa to teach you! There can be nothing between us, she is married. Then why will you not kiss me? Your gift is innate. It accompanies you as fate. You were not simply born, you were chosen, I feel it. The answer must be sought in the past. When you were still a child. - Are you ready? - For what? I could not save his five brothers. It is some kind of curse, I am powerless. It is God's will. He decides who survives and who does not. - Your task is to treat our son. - Mama... Lisa? Maybe you're my destiny? I ask only one thing of you: pick the blood flower, and the gold is ours. If you succeed, you'll live like a pig in clover until your dying day. So, is it a deal? This Basavryuk is not just a demon. he is a hunter of souls. What do you mean, "a hunter of souls"? He gets men drunk, gives necklaces to maidens. They hang on his every word, and he corrupts their souls. And the people are too afraid to bring justice upon him? This damned demon has struck into us such fear that it is shameful to admit. Last year, I wanted to follow him, but he saw me. I had to run away. He was going to Bear Creek. It is rumored that he corrupts souls in that cursed place. Nobody can find a single trace of proof. That son of Satan can cover his tracks. Tell me, Father, does Lisa Danishevskaya often come here? All the time. A beautifully pure soul. She prays ardently, as if for two. It must be for the sins of her husband. What are his sins? Only she and God know. But I am sure he lives in sin. I have never seen him in the church. Thank you, I will go. I won't disturb her. He was going to Bear Creek. The blood flower blooms once a year, under the moon in the night of Intercession Beast. The den of the beast. Bear Creek. Nikolai Vasilievich? Lisa, do you know of the Bear Creek? Why do you ask? Just tell me. It's very important. Yeah, this place is in the north of the forest, near the lake, but... nobody goes there. The locals say evil lurks there. But I think it's mere superstition. Sorry i have to go otherwise it will be too late. Nikolai Vasilievich, do you plan to go to the Bear's Creek? You can’t go there. It can be very dangerous. I have to go. Granny Komarikha was telling stories about you. She said when you were young, you met a real demon. Oh, don't listen to that old lady! Now go to sleep. Don't talk of demons at night, or they will take you away. Sleep. Vakula. Vakula! Vakula... Can you take me to Bear Creek? Nikolay Vasilievich. I won’t go to this damn place. And I'd advise you the same. Then at least tell me where it is. And do you have any sort of... weapon? Just to frighten off animals. I am afraid to go alone. It's an old custom: you burn a sheet on Intercession Night, and you will be married. We're still too young, though. Maybe you're my betrothed? The moon will soon come out, and the blood flower will rise. Take it. Look at all this gold. It will soon be ours. To take the gold from the water, you must do one small thing. Sprinkle the earth with her blood. You will be rich, and Bogdana will be yours. It remains only to kill her sister. Hurry up. Petro. The moon is leaving. Gold then disappears. There will be no forgiveness for me. I will burn in hell. Such is the fate of a Cossack. Petro, stop. Drop the dagger! Don't listen to him! If the gold goes, you lose Bogdana. He's a demon! It's not gold he wants. He wants to take your soul! Kill her, and Bogdana is yours. Don't believe him! Bogdana will never love a murderer. She will never know. Look, Petro... the gold is disappearing. Petro, don't do it! Please, please don’t! The beast. Hemophilus bloomed in the night and took two to their doom! What happened to her? Get out of here! Go! Where is the doctor? Doctor... can you save her? She will die during the surgery. I cannot accept the burden. Who should live, and who should die... is for God to decide, not you. Is that clear? I am the only survivor of six brothers. That was His will. And this will be His decision. You just do what you know best. You're a talented doctor. I do not know my calling in this life, but you were born for this purpose. I will need an assistant. I'm at your service. Enough, daughter! It was your fault he went there! It was all your greed! If Darinka dies, it will also be because of you! She is not breathing. Is that ... did he decide that? Yes. He decided so. One thing haunts me. There was some girl unknown to me. but some girl whom I don't recognize. Maybe you did see her before, and your mind is playing tricks on you. Perhaps. Crucially, all the girls are alive. The rider has not killed on this night. It means my system must be wrong. Lisa. Why are you here? Alexey is away until the morning, and... I could not sit at home not knowing how you were. If you hadn’t returned from the Bear Creek. I would have never forgiven myself. What's up with the girl? Did you manage to save her? Yes. Everything is all right, she is alive. You risked your life. Never do that again. I must go now. Nikolai Vasilievich... I know it is wrong. But I’ll say it anyway. I love you. I love you too. Such a Pity. She was a good girl. Bozhanna was her name. Maybe you're my betrothed? "Hemophilus bloomed in the night and took two to their doom!" Sorry ? Nothing. This at least confirms your theory. The rider does kill on feast days. And when is the next feast day? In ... in 5 days. Mokosh Day, Friday. We will no longer bend to his will. What do you suggest? There will be no victims. There will be no one to kill. CHAPTER 4: VIY Today... in the village of Dikanka and its surroundings. all female individuals under the age of thirty will fall under the enactment... of a special provision. Meaning what? After dark, all girls must be kept in sight, and preferably not let outside at all, until the morning, when the cock crows. I can't even visit my child's godmother? Listen to us! It's for your own good until we find the killer. Enough! Stop spouting nonsense! Worse than a drunk Muscovite! You're not the police! Nikolay Vasilievich. You really don't know how to communicate with this people. Right! Everyone calm down! Do not let your girls out of sight! Understood? That's all. Now go home. "The mystery of birth. A dark one?" Nikolay Vasilievich. You should have slept already. You’re scribbling paper all night. I'll sleep later. - Yakim... - Yes? You've known me from the cradle. Indeed. I served your parents before you were born. Tell me, did any weird occurrences in my childhood happen... Something strange? No. You were sick sometimes, but nothing special. If I may, sir, I will return to my sleep. Yakim, are you hiding anything from me? I wouldn't dream of it, sir. Get some sleep, Nikolai Vasilievich. SOROCHINTSY, 1809 Be patient. Keep going. Push! Why, why is he silent? He's not breathing. O Lord, have mercy on your servant, Vasily Gogol. Let at least one of my children born alive and will not die. Hear me, O Lord. Hey, sir... I know how to ease your pain. Do you wish to have a healthy child? Is that possible? Everything is possible. It only depends on how far you are willing to go. I would do anything. I cannot... bury another infant. And no one saw who left these marks? In the morning these marks were found in seven huts. Gentlemen, this is not paint. It is blood. Right, everyone to their homes! Nothing to see here. How fascinating. It's very similar to dog hair. It must have been a warlock. Well. When I was a child my Grandma told me that they send messages in dog blood. Warlock or not, seven houses have been marked. All of them are home to young girls. All these girls have been selected as the rider's victims. But why did he leave these marks? Perhaps he has an accomplice in the village, who helps him identify victims. Ulyana, have you seen my dog Serko? - I haven't. - Where the devil is he? Did you hear what has befallen us of late? The rider has branded seven girls with his terrible mark. - You don't say! - I swear it is true. Come now, old lady, you cannot believe he is real? At your age, you believe in fairy tales? Laugh all you like. When he comes for your soul, you'll laugh even harder! He is welcome to it! I do like to laugh. Off with you, reckless girl! Why did you come to Dikanka.? I don't understand. The rider killed peasant girls. I see why he marked village houses, but a noble estate? I suppose a servant girl is to be taken as victim. The rider marked not seven, but eight girls. The eighth is Lisa. Elizaveta Andreevna. Tomorrow is a feast day. Mokos Friday. This means the rider... will start act tonight. You need to hide all these girls somewhere. But where are you going to hide them? Is it possible to lock them all in one of our cells? No, it’s dangerous for them to stay in the village. There's an abandoned farm near Dikanka, a perfect hideout. Just what we need. Well, the idea sounds good. Before dark, we must gather all the girls and bring them to the farm. Nobody is allowed to know about it, except us. Very well. We shall see. Alexander Khristoforovich, shall we gather the girls? Wait, it is not yet necessary to take anyone anywhere. We must still think. How are you feeling? I really do not know. All these marks, murders, the rider... I am just glad you are here now and I am no longer in danger. Unfortunately, this is not so Lisa. We need to speak seriously about your safety. Lisa? Don't be afraid! I botched a deer shoot, had to finish it with a knife. Mr. Gogol. A pleasure to see you. Will you dine with us? This time I won't accept a refusal. To the man who risks his life for our safety. To you, Nikolai Vasilievich. - I must ask something of you. - I'm listening. It concerns Elizabeth Andreevna. I believe... that she is not safe here. - Why so? - The rider has not yet been caught. We are sending the village girls whose houses were marked to an abandoned farm near Dikanka under escort for the night. And I absolutely believe that your wife should join them. - For what reason? - As a precautionary measure. I take a different view. - Forgive me, but I insist... - You insist? Nikolai Vasilievich, in this house, only I may insist. Should you wish to do so, insist freely in your own home... with regard to your own wife. Ah, sorry, I forgot. You're not married. Thank you for lunch. I must go. Nikolai Vasilievich... Please forgive Alexey, he is too proud to accept another's help. And for his pride he’s ready to risk your life? Perhaps he is right, and I am indeed safe here. Serko. Good day, Vasilinka, have you seen my dog Serko? No. I haven’t seen him. I'll drag that mongrel by the ears! Sniffing around, are you? I'm just taking Papa's overcoat to to the seamstress.. Don't you want to come inside and taste my dumplings? No, thank you. I have to run. Run along, my little witch. Why didn't you give my overcoat? Papa, do you know Ulyana? I know of her, but no more. A truly wicked woman. Why do you ask about her? Is Ulyana... is she an evil spirit? Why do you say that? Come on, speak up. Where did this Ulyana come from to Dikanka? She came here from Poltava a year ago, as a modest widow. We took her in, gave her a home, before she revealed her true nature. She clouds others with sin. Lord forgive me, she even flirts with the priest. Could Vasilina have made this up? We don't lie in my house. If my daughter says she saw dumplings fly, then she did. And there was the dead dog, too. A dead dog? Yeah. Blood flowed from him. It is possible that Ulyana is the accomplice of the rider. And where does she live? As you leave, turn left and go past three houses. Go and fetch Mr. Binkh. We will meet outside her house. [speaking mysterious language] Disperse, everyone! There is nothing here to see! Could you really not have seen the killer at all? - Nothing that may identify them? - I could not. So, you let the killer escape, and remember nothing of them. Leopold Leopoldovich... do you know what language this is? "Sumito dolis... ongis..." Actually. Reminds Latin. But... I cannot understand a single word. My good man, help me lift her. My dear God! What else is there? Look, there is a nail. It is no a simple nail. It is silver. - Look at this, gentlemen. - May I? Such cursed nails are used to crucify witches. So how it seems. Vasilina was right. Ulyana is a witch, and perhaps served the rider. I still fail to understand why the devil you came here alone. I was afraid of scaring her off. "Afraid". Nikolai Vasilievich, are you sure that you did not imagine this killer? What are you implying? I am not implying anything. I am merely clarifying. So you want to say that I murdered Ulyana? For what reason? For what reason would I kill her? I don't know. But let's speak purely theoretically. If Ulyana was indeed the rider's accomplice, along with you... then she could betray you, so her death would benefit you. But that is purely theoretical. While you invent baseless theories, a new killer roams free. I saw him with my own eyes. You saw him, but cannot recall him. Careful, I must still dissect her. We must search the entire village. And if you don't find him? Right now, it is imperative we send away the girls. I still want to weigh up the pros and cons. Can you do it any faster, then? It'll be dark soon. What then? Alexander Khristoforovich, do we take the girls to the farm? I don’t know. I still have my doubts. But you yourself said the investigator's idea is sound. My doubts are with regard him. Open the gates! Our deceased did indeed give me a surprise. There are no signs of decomposition. The tissues remain firm. If she had blood, I would think that I’m dissecting a living person. The stake was driven right into the heart, as if someone wished to punish a witch. Not that I believe such nonsense. As I do not believe in the resurrection of the dead. Strange to hear such words from a man who drags people back into this world. Come now, Nikolai Vasilievich. What's the use of it? Sooner or later... For each of my patients will come someone with a scythe. And take them forever. Once, I attempted... to resurrect a child who had died during the surgery. I used electrical shocks. It didn't work. There was a big scandal. It was that experiment that led to my exile. Death is impossible to defeat. And that means life does not make sense. Your time is wasted, Nikolai Vasilievich. Nobody is spared. I do not agree with you, God gave us life for a reason. I do not believe in your God, just as I don't believe in resurrection. Your lack of belief does you more harm than your drunkenness. To your health, witch. I am leaving. You know what? I forgive you. I will not think of your Lisa. Why anger myself? It's not like you'll ever be together. She is married. But I am free. I'm like a cool stream. - I can quench your thirst... - Stop it. Can you read this? How should I know? I'm just a miller's daughter. Then do you recognize this? What's wrong? Take it away. This is an aspen from the holy land against evil spirits. Why are you torturing me like that, monster? Sorry. So it really was a ritual killing, and Ulyana really was... We searched from top to bottom, but did not find our demon. Shall we gather the girls? Or not? Tesak, you've been annoying me all day! Alexander Khristoforovich, I've worked it out. The killer will return to complete the rite. - Return where? - I'll show you. I need your help. It’s amazing. We fought like lions here and this vodka bottle didn't even wake up. Nikolay Vasilievich, I cannot deny I had suspicions concerning you. Please forgive me. I accept my mistake.. But this is not the first time for you. Who are you? Name? Title? Will you be silent all day, like a lamb? You will answer our questions! From what I understand, Ulyana was a witch, and you killed her for something, a kind of ritual or rite? Witches, rites, rituals! Nikolai Vasilievich, can't you see he's a common murderer? Do you recognize this? Rutanus unguibus alto Matirl Tametist. It is very clear. He is simply mocking us. It is dark Latin, for casting spells. You won't understand. As the saying goes "If a blind man leads a blind man then both will fall into the pit." Matthew, chapter 15 verse 14. Who is blind here? Wait, how do you know the scripture so well? Where from? My name is Homa Brutus. Theologian by education, exorcist by trade. An exorcist? You? Here you catch criminals I am called on by the church to fight evil spirits. I wander, seek out the possessed, and conduct purification rites. What brings you to Dikanka? I have chased this witch for almost three years. She was always on the move. I almost got her, then you came! Goodness gracious! Hunting evil spirits, eh? I see right through you, scoundrel. You only wish to justify your acts of murder! Fighting evil? Who will believe you? I do not need your belief. - Wait until you get hard labor! - Let us return to the inscription. If you know this language, tell me what it says. If you move, he's dead! Get in the cell. Lock the door. If even one hair falls from the head of Nikolai Vasilievich I'll hang you on a pillar. The keys! I will not hang you, I will bury you alive! Lower your hands. And the Lord said, do not be afraid, you will not die. Book of Judges, chapter 6, verse 23. How did you free yourself? A wooden hand, just like a real one. A craftsman made it for me in Kiev. Pechersk Lavra. What do you want? You have to help me. I need to complete the rite. You and I both know that Ulyana is a witch. Are you not curious as to what is going on? I am. I... Easy, easy... - Alexander Khristoforovich? What...? - Where are they? - Who? - Let me out. The keys are there. - Right away. - Gather the Cossacks. Send some to search for the runaway criminal Homa Brutus. Take care, he has Gogol hostage. The rest can collect the girls from the marked houses and take them to the farm. Stop right there. There's no escape. Nikolai Vasilyevich, thank God you are alive. - Vakula, let us past. - What do you mean? Alexander Khristoforovich is in a rage. The whole village is on alert. I need this man. And how should I understand that? Listen. We need to complete a rite in the church. Believe me. And please, not a word to Binkh. Hurry up, get moving. Quiet. Quiet. Quiet. Quiet. Where are you taking her so late? We're under police orders. I can’t say anything else. Tesak! Is that all of them? - Yes, sir! - Well done. Have the felon and Mr. Gogol been found? We're looking. Let's go. This will be dangerous. The last time I encountered Viy, it ended like this. And who is this "Viy" of whom you speak? A demon from hell. He gives power to evil spirits. I have been hunting him for years. Will you use Ulyana as bait? Yes, she is a strong witch. If she calls him, he will appear. And I will destroy him! Why are you so sure that this time you will defeat him? You've already lost a hand. Want to lose your head, too? Your paper is a spell written in dark Latin. And it's the only thing that can stop Viy. And if it does not work? And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching in vain. 1 Corinthians chapter 15. Verse 14. God willing, we will manage this. Enter in the circle. Quick, enter in the circle. What's wrong with you? Inside! Quick! Hurry! Come on! Hurry! Faster girls. Come on, come on. Run fast. Come on, come on. Tell me, Does it happen to you sometimes. Something incomprehensible. Mysterious dreams or visions? - Why are you asking? - I feel your dark side. And who knows, it might help us tonight. I am sure you are mistaken. I am sure I am not. How long must we sit here? "With your patience save your souls." Luke, chapter 21. Verse 19. Enough. Binkh was right. You were not to be trusted. - I committed a crime for you. - Wait. Where are you going? We both will survive, no matter what. Which gospel is that? The Gospel of Homa Brutus. And what kind of beard does he have? Hey, Stepan! What's so funny? You never know with girls! Stepan! Help me. Wait don't go there! Be quiet!
