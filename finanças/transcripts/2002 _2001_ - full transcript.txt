This is the roof. Where did she fall from? Sir, she would've fallen from around 600-700 feet. But there aren't any tall buildings around here. Unless she fell from a plane… So strange. Sir, air traffic control just confirmed. No aircraft in the vicinity today. It's… unbelievable. Coroner! This roof is haunted! Sir, the Boss. Yes, Sir? Kau, let them take lead on this. I've told them to clear the scene. Get it done. Quickly. Step over the fire, everyone. Dragon, pig, dog years. Don't look. Cousin, a ghost… I know. Don't look. Bye. Wait up! What's up? We're dismissed. Let's go! Calm down! No flash! I'm dizzy. That's my entrance. And what am I? You brought up your problems too fast. I can't look cool now. A girl was looking over here, you know? If you'd waited, I'd look cooler. But I could feel your nerves. My nerves? You're sweating. Your eye is twitching. She was looking at me. I was... flirting. With my eyes. Fine. Go on with your problems. That would be cool. I will, or I'll die. If I die, no revenge for you. That's heavy. What floor is this? 17th, going on 18th. Must be a Class 3. I say Class 4. We can smell it, 20 levels away. Must be vicious. Jumped to their death, looks like. So, a flying ghost. Like you can fly, Mister Cool. Step aside. Watch me. Careful. Go do your own thing. Do your own thing Miss… A ghost! I'm not the ghost, you are. Don't worry. You're dead. Mr. Chan said he'd take me with him. What should I do? I don't feel hatred in you. But don't stay here, or you'll become a hate ghost. My card. Look me up. Dead yet? Die! Come help me! You told me to step aside. Vision Drops! His powers are half gone. You only have five minutes. Hurry! Do you believe I can take him in one? Teacher Chan? You love your student. But why harm an innocent girl? I'm sorry. You may not be reincarnated! Why didn't you do that before? Didn't want to steal your cool. He's watching us. Should we beat him up? We spend so much on that department, but why? I can't see it. I don't feel any ghosts. One guy in the whole department, and all he does is blow up satellite dishes. No one can watch TV. We're flooded with phone complaints. And the coroner's death, too. What do I tell my bosses? What do I tell the public? Regular cases are less troublesome. As for this... I won't sign. TV's that important? If it weren't for us, this could have been much worse. Sir, 2002 needs signatures from all precinct heads in order to keep on going. If you don't sign, it won't be approved. The others have signed, so it must be useful. Maybe we can't see them, but some cases can't be explained by science. A one-person department is unusual, but Inspector Yau communicates with that world. If he keeps order in that realm, we don't see a problem. No. I'm not signing it. You say that because you're not the one with a problem. I'm in trouble here. I signed it! Leave me alone! Yau, you've made your point. Stay away! Don't blame me. Have someone change the fluorescent light. Good, the chalice! Lucky number 40. Great! I know. Sam lost, so he has to go. I told you that. When? You've been partners too long. Time to let go. He's the one who wanted to stay. He's got no family, no friends. It's better that he goes. You're the one with no family or friends. Did you want him to stay? I'm a guy. Why would I want him? Paper Chan, loan me $3 billion. You gambler, it's never enough. Forget it! I stopped gambling! Then get me some girls. I've given you all kinds. You can't handle more. How about a smoke? Gimme a cigarette? No! What? Okay, fine. Thanks, Boss! Ignore the wandering ones, you owe me $1.50 for smokes. It's reincarnation season. Sam will go anytime You're his friend. Buy from me. Burn lots of things. I have the latest, look. [Missing Chinese dialogue here] China visas. They need them down there, too. Poor things. Well, Boss? How much? You know it's just the one price. $3,888. $3,888? Excuse me. Miss, can I help? Do you have... candles? Candles? Yes, hang on. This kind? Sorry, not this kind. I mean a Western candle. A candle? Yes, yes... First shop on your right. Thanks. No problem. Miss… You again? A Western uniform, for Western good. Look around. Don't follow me. Watch the other store. Front door, please. Ignore him. Look at this. It's good, thick enough. Where's paper Chan? Not here. I'm watching the store. This is an 8210, he sold me a 8250. I don't care, give me the right one. An 8250? Yes. Let me see. Found it yet? Quiet. I'm looking. An 8250? Yes. Here. See, it's not even the same style. Chan said it was. Give me some incense. Ask the boss. We're old neighbors, Chan gives them to me. Can't do that. I would if I could. Are you joking? You dare take gifts from him? You got a death wish? I'll show you. Your hand... Leave me alone. Let her see. Look, what is this? It's the Star of Death. They say the Star of Death kills your friends, family, your spouse. He's fated to be alone. Not only friends! Even colleagues. Anyone who touches him dies. You dare take this? You're dead! Greedy! So you can't ever date or marry? Never date. Too dangerous. But flirting is fine. Why tell her everything? I'm going now. Stay and chat. You're handsome. A cute guy like you, you must be something else. I'm going. Respect your parents, work hard. Shut up! They're dead, okay? Go home. Go. And don't drop by! Can I use your Octopus card? Mine ran out. I don't have one. Loan me $5. Miss, I have both. Thanks. I see you here all the time. Remember to pay me back. Don't owe me money. There's no substitute for blood. We need 700 donors every day. I work in the hospital. A lot of people die in a hospital? Yes. About how many? We average 2.5 deaths per day. Life is so fragile. So true. Every time you give blood, you help 3-4 people. How can I get a tape of that? I wonder. Yes. Well, I'm there. Remember to pay me back. I will, next time. Driver, where can I get a tape of the program you're playing? Government Warning: Do not speak to the driver while vehicle is in motion. You'll kill him! I was just asking. Miss, I have it. Crazy! I thought you left. Not without beating you up. Go ahead. You owe me a shooting, but there's no gun. Pay it back in your next life. I'll burn one for you. Shoot me. I forgot where you shot me. I was never angry at you. We're friends! Your new partner will be here soon. Standard-issue car, no registration. Your work's so secret, you must be well-paid. You looked me up? I saw the roof incident. I see spirits, too. I want to join you. For the pay? No. I want to give back to society. He'll match three conditions. One, as with the 18 buddhas, he'll have 18 gifts for you. No need to count. It's 18. Let me join you. I'll cancel them. A Fortune Star on his shoulder. In his chart, it's 167. Not fair? File a complaint. Three... Pants down. Why? If you want a transfer… You're the one. I need one who can sacrifice dignity for ideals. I can. When do I start? Soon as you pull your pants up. A man who knows no shame. A fire started at a rave. There's a burn victim with untouched clothing. Check it out. Come on! Just like that? Why not? Put these on. These are Touch Gloves. They can touch and hit spirits. Why are they lined? Spirit-striking gun, safety off. Clip's in, your blood's in the bullet. Just load the chamber, and shoot. Why blood? Thick needle, easy to lose too much blood. Vision Drops, so you can see the spirits. That's half a ghost's power, but you'll only have five minutes. Why five and not six? How would I know? Why so many questions? Why are you a guy? Why are you named Fung? Why Fung? Dad named me. Why a guy and not a girl? Because I have Y chromosomes. Y, joined with an X, makes a boy. Why the questions? If I don't know the answers, I can't work, and then I get fired. I'll look up there, you look there. Don't ask. Be careful. Can't you tell it's an illusion? Get up! I can't! Look out! Shoot! Hang in there! What's with you? I was scared. Couldn't move. This always happens. Hey! Carry me. A ghost-hunter, afraid of ghosts. You're repaying society? Rubbish! Let's up! Gently, please. Dinner's on me when I get paid. I know, he's terrible. Told you before, many times. When? I did. You weren't listening. Who succeeds right off the bat? It takes time. So kind to ghosts, so nasty to humans. He's not just terrible, he's garbage! Fine. He's afraid. But he was paralyzed with fear! There's plenty of time. Chiu! Chiu, you promised to give me a scooter. Yes. $300, $420 with the gun. Okay, get it. He's getting it. Listen, move on. Get reincarnated. Otherwise, you'll just get run over every day. When mom comes, I'll go. Mom's coming soon. Thanks. His mom is coming? So, she'll die soon. Who caused whose death? $420. Not now. Okay. It's not like you're dying. Sure, because you're the Star of Death. So I'll cause Fung's death? That's how destiny works. Even if he weren't your partner, he'd still die. Not because of you. Don't flatter yourself. It's not all about you. He has to be a ghost to replace Sam. Yes. A man-ghost partnership. It must be this way. If he has unfinished business, help him finish it. Then he has to work for you, and not be a mean ghost. Dinner time. You moved all your books to my home. Are you a ghost-hunter or a maid? Your home is so big, it needs some human touches. Here, taste. Thanks. What are friends for? You eat shrimp? Greens. We're not friends, just colleagues. Whatever! Is it good? Yes. You learned from TV? My mom taught me. Last time… it was pretty terrible. Give me time. Next time I'll be better. I'll be great! Why be a ghost hunter? You can be a chef! I'm in my 20's. Never brought home a penny. But it's different now. Second-in-command at 2002, nice uniform, better pay. Not bad. Any unfinished business? Too many. Travel, win the lottery, be a Hollywood star… Never did any of that. Anything else? That's it. I'll get you more rice. Who are you? Grandma Pat recommended you. Call me Grandma Four. You don't have to match my broccoli. Just so you know, I'm a ghost. Of course. I know that. Pat said you like ghosts. Take care of my granddaughter. Your granddaughter? We were both in the car crash. She's still in a coma, and has no family. Can you take care of her? Go. We'll help you. Don't trick an old woman! You know I'm scary. We promise, Grandma Four. Go now. Thank you. Hospitals are full of ghosts. I know. Go check out your weak knees? Sure. Wheelchair rentals over there. Sure. Epileptic fit? What? It looks like her. Look! In what way? They're identical. See that? She's prettier. I found this on the street in high school and kept it. You like her? Yes. It looks like her. I don't think so. Whatever you say. You! You work here? Visiting your girlfriend? No... Not mine... His. Not mine. I'm going. Hey! What? Can you pay back my $5? I don't have change. Tomorrow, then. You'll be back? If you'll pay me back. Come and I will. See you then. Okay. Tomorrow. $5 Stop it. She's a vegetable. The doctor says she could wake up any time. I'm massaging her, so her muscles won't atrophy. My wallet's atrophied. Why don't you massage that? It's the nurse's job. You don't understand. I want to do something for her to increase her chances of waking up. And if she does? Last night, you asked what I wanted to do. I want to fall in love. With her? Incredible incident at Central. Check it out! Now, I have no fear. No matter what, let me at it. No more need for rescues? It's different now. I have motivation. I'll kill any spirit I see! Okay. You're here, look. The body? None. The driver? None. No driver. What do you want? It's just… One, this is the city, but that's a suburban cab. Look, the meter's still on. But this light is on, and running meters mean passengers. This light won't be on. See, isn't it incredible? Running meters... This light won't be on... Isn't it incredible? What? Well… Sir, I think this is… Well, really... Are you okay? Of course. I would have gotten out in time. But isn't it incredible? It's ridiculous, not incredible. I can't feel any ghosts. Next time, don't call us for this. Get the Traffic Department. I used to work there. Call a Lau Wah. Lau Wah? Do you know him? Should I call? Should I? Not incredible, just moronic. Isn't it incredible? 2002 killed your girl... Get your revenge on them. That's all I know. Get up! Wake up! It's you? Don't touch me. I'm fine. No... Stay away, please. Make breakfast, read, do something. I don't mind. No, I'm going to... Don't touch. I'm going to see Rain. You coming? I've got plans. Okay. Bye. Bye. It's comfortable? Yes. Expensive? Yes. May I try? No power. What are you up to? She can wake up to a new scene. It's a hospital, not a garden. Hospitals are dreary. It won't do. Flowers suck oxygen, don't you know that? You're the one who doesn't know. They produce carbon dioxide at night. Don't touch this. So now you're her boyfriend. I'm positioning it. She'll wake up, and see me first. Here. The legs over there. You bought this. It's not for you. You've gone too far. She's not dead. Her back must be stiff from this. You've felt her back? Such a dirty mind. Help me. Help, here. To do what? Move her there. It's not for you. Come on! Look at me, look at my clothes. What? It's just our uniform. You know that. We're on duty, and not as orderlies! On duty is on duty. Life is life. An exciting life makes one work harder. Don't touch. Don't help. Get out there. There's a ghost. Go get it. Chiu, why are you here? Why are you here? Waiting for mom. She's bleeding too much! Hurry! Oxygen for the baby! Yes! Hurry! There's mom. Doctor, how is my wife? Neither she nor the baby will live. I'm sorry. Mom! Mom! Son! Mom, let's go. Son, listen. Enter your baby brother. Live again. Mom, you're not taking me? Stay with dad. Cheer him up. Mom will watch you from afar. Son, go now. Good boy. Listen to mom. Don't hide your tears. Human tears mean stubbornness, but ghost tears mean love and resurrection. Now go. What can I do? Your wife has a message. She says this is fate, but don't be sad. When you can, find the baby a new mother. Doctor, the baby's breathing! What? Come here! Your money. I don't have change. Neither do I. Now you owe me. Bye. You're flirting with a nurse? And you with a patient. What a lewd smile! Congratulations! For what? Rosy cheeks. You're in love. Dating? You want to kill her? No! What are you saying? I'm saying… What's in your pocket? None of your business! Take it out! You know what's there? It's a heart! Out! Take it out! It's a heart. It's a plane. A plane? It's a heart. You say plane? Fine. It's a plane heart. You're not responsible for Fung's death, but dating will kill her. Watch out, unless you want an afterlife wedding. Hi! Here's your $995. You don't have to pay me back yet. Debts must be cleared. Dinner tonight? I can't tonight. Tomorrow? I can't. Can't, or don't want to? I don't want to. Why not? No reason. Any reason you're blocking my way? Let me in. Emergency room, nurse. I'm sorry. Doctor! Doctor! Rain is awake! Doctor! Blink. Tongue out. More, more. Good. Raise your left hand. Grab my finger. Harder, harder. Okay, not so hard. What is your name? Take your time. Rest. She's awake. I know. Talk to her, she can hear you. Talk to her a lot. Will she suddenly go back to sleep? If she's awake, she's awake. If she sleeps, she sleeps. Next morning, she'll wake. She's like a normal person, but you can't treat her like one. But don't treat her like she's not normal, or she'll never adust to normal life. It's contradictory. Which means? In summary, she's awake. But after a long coma, she'll have short-term amnesia. Just remember one word. Care about her, cherish her... Love her. That's seven words. You really don't remember anything? Who are you? Fung. I'm Fung. I just told you. Yes! Who are you? Fung. Is that you? This? Yes. Yes, I'm your boyfriend. You took this on my birthday. Looks like you took it yourself. Really? No. I'll really cause Fung's death? It must be a man-ghost partnership. If he's fated to die, Even if he weren't your partner, he'd still die. Fung, we need to talk. Come here. Wait. Paper Chan. Paper Chan! Why are we here? Don't touch. It's for you. For you! Paper Chan. Stop shouting. I know. You want me to tell him. What? You know why you're my partner? Because I can give up dignity for ideals, right? Life is about birth and death. You're dying! Our department uses man-ghost partnerships. We're burning these for you. You don't believe it? That's life. Death is a solemn thing. If it's your time to die, You have to accept it. Life and death... I must die... but not you two! Why? Why burn these for me? Here! Why did you tell me? Just let me die. I told you so you can prepare yourself. I've brought your money. Do what you want. Money? It can buy more life? Go play, go home. I don't care. Don't sit here. If you want, I'll see Rain with you. You told me so I won't be with her. Why tell me to see her now? So you can be her friend. Do you know she'll like you? See her one last time, for closure. I don't want you to have regrets. Chan told you. You won't cause my death, so don't feel guilty. Why tell me to see her now? You'd rather wait here to die? I don't know. I wish you could cause my death, so I could beat you up! Go ahead! Beat me up! I bring death to my friends! You think I like it? And me? I'm 24, no girlfriends. Just a photo. I'm 22. Chan says I'll live 'til 80. 80! Causing the death of every friend. I found my girl, but I can't date her. I hope that... I'm the one who dies. Then you're worse off. You're worse off than me. You'll die. You're worse off. A life worse than death. That's true, but you'll die with hate in your heart. I woke up and forgot who I am. I saw your photo. You're my boyfriend? I wish, but no. You don't know me. I'm Fung. Did you do this, Fung? Yes. It's so pretty. Thanks. Are you my friend? Yes, my only friend. But, I may not remember you in a minute. Just remember this one. You're Fung. You have a Grandma named Four. She told me to visit you. Why didn't she come? Next time, I'll tell her. Your girlfriend? I had one, too. Go, find her. Who are you talking to? Nothing. She's disappeared. I'll never find her. Remember the girl you killed at the fire? Rain, run! Yes! Chan said I'd live 'til 80. Readings? Blood pressure 60/40, pulse 38. 110/70, pulse 70. Notify ICU, he's coming. His brain's damaged from lack of oxygen. He's at ICU for observation, still in critical condition. He may not last the night. Just one word... Got it. Fung! Where's Chiu? Why him, and not me? We can't know fate. We trusted you! Now you say this? It's all talk! Not true. It's fate! The water ghost is strong. He'll be back. Be careful. I don't care. Tell me how to find Chiu's soul Go where he has unresolved issues. It's my turn. I know how you felt. Sometimes... it's not up to us. I thought everything was fated. So I obeyed Chan in all that he said. I didn't dare make friends. I wasted my time. You didn't. You helped ghosts, and you helped me. If it wasn't for you, I still wouldn't know what I want. I often ask others what they want, but never myself. What unresolved business do you have? Give me some Vision Drops. Let's have dinner, please. Excuse me, bathroom. You're all wet. I fell. Laugh if you want. I need to tell you something. Yes? I like you. What? Yes. I like you. I always wondered… why we kept meeting on the bus, you and me. You kept asking for your $5. You turned down my dinner invitation, but never explained why. Now, suddenly, you say you like me. I don't know what you want. I just wanted to tell you… I've liked you for a long time. Your favorite color is white. Not just your uniform. You wear white a few times a week. You're environmentally aware, and only use canvas totes. On Wednesdays, you wear glasses. I think that's because you stay up late in the ER on Tuesdays, and can't get your contacts in the next morning. You love ice cream. When the bus passes Haagen-Dazs, you look hungry. You must like white bunny dolls. How do you know? You look like one. Can you come with me? Where? For ice cream. Let's have it here. You know what I like. Come on, let's go. What? Where are you going? I'm so sorry. I can't go with you. Next time. There may not be a next time. Where are you going? No time. I have to go. When we had time, I did nothing. Now, all I can do is eat with you. And I've always wanted to give you this. Better late than never. Go to the hospital. You'll see. Bye. Come on. The precinct heads want to see you. Turn in your gun. Yau's in a coma. As a rookie, you can't be in charge of 2002. We cannot keep a headless department. We'll keep the spirit-striking gun. I'll arrange a new job for you. Fung, starting today, all work from 2002 is suspended. We'll issue further instructions later on. Who dares cut my department! As the former head of 2002, I refuse to let you do this. The former head? Yes. You said former. All precincts oversee 2002, and many have signed this. Who are you to refuse? Each world keeps its order. Humans have human cops. Ghosts have ghost cops. Must a headless department be cut? I ask you. If all the senior police officers died, would the Hong Kong Police shut down? Answer me! Yes, you keep order in the ghost world. But you often leave me with problems. Consider my position. Sure. Excuse me. Let me think. Well? That's why I couldn't find you! You've possessed Fung! Help... Help! Help! Return to your body, before it's too late. Fung's in trouble. I have to help him. Make sure you can come back. I run my own life. Now you owe me $5. You have to pay me back. I'm waiting. Chiu, show no mercy! Get the Water Ghost out before he completely controls Fung! When his other eye turns blue, you have to kill Fung to destroy the Water Ghost. He's good! I'll use my ultimate move! Chiu, sword incoming! Go! You want to kill Fung? Burn me something to get it out! His pulse has stopped. Give him CPR! Chiu, clobber him! Burn! You'll die! Nothing. Give him epinephrine! So much pain… Kill me! When his other eye turns blue, you have to kill Fung in order to destroy the Water Ghost. You won't cause my death, so don't feel guilty. I bring death to my friends. You think I like it? I wish you did cause my death, So I could beat you up! Go ahead! Beat me up! I want to join you. For the pay? No. I want to give back to society. What are friends for? You eat shrimp? Greens. We're not frineds, just colleagues. You're flirting with a nurse? And you with a patient. Wake up! Okay, Danielle. Stop. Certify time of death as 2:20pm. You know him? Take care of this. Chiu, it's loaded with my blood. Fung is beyond help. Kill him! No more time. Shoot. This is only chance! No more time. Shoot! Shoot! We're man-ghost partners! We're not partners... We're friends. Human tears mean stubbornness. Ghost tears mean love and resurrection. Hurry before your Vision Drops wear off. I can't. I'm used to floating. I can't walk fast. Go in. And you? No, you're family. She won't remember me. No, she'll recognize you faster. Fung… Your Grandma? Yes. I know you wish to join them. Go away. No, I can do it. I'm fine. Show me. You use man-ghost partners. Arranged by fate. Says who? 2002 will now use two-man partners. It's my final word. You won't buy from me any more. 2002, something incredible's happened. Check it out!
