I have the honor today to introduce you to Retired Captain William Miller. He's been everywhere in the world you all wanna go... and a bunch of places you don't. I've asked him to come and talk to you all today at this important crossroad in your careers. I'm gonna step out so this conversation can be frank and to the point. About five years ago, when I was on leave... ...I found myself standing in the middle of the cereal aisle at the Publix... with my arm around some guy's throat. I was squeezing so hard he pissed himself. My fiancée at the time had to climb on my back just so I didn't actually kill the guy. Do you know why I was doing this? Because he hadn't moved his cart when I asked. I was the best of the best, able to shut down, control, manipulate... all basic human instincts towards one goal: the completion of my mission. But the effects of committing extreme violence on other human beings are biological and physiological. That's the price of being a warrior. Is everything clear in the valley? Affirmative! Copy that. Enter, enter, enter! Let's go! Enter, enter, enter. Let me inform you that we have you surrounded. So, put down your weapons, come out of the building with your hands behind your head. How many did you say were in there? No more than ten. No, no, no! You guys hold this position. We're going to find other cover. But hold here. Good. Rodriguez! Rodriguez, can you hold your position? Rodriguez! Fuck no! We need to get back. I said, maintain your positions. - Hold on! - Move him! Move him! Rodriguez? Rodriguez? Rodriguez! Diego! Hold on! Advance. Nice shot. I'm so tired of arresting all of you only to simply find you all here again. Oh, my adviser is here. Ready, brother? America is listening. Take the money, brother. It's $400,000. You lose nothing. I already have the money. And... and Lorea? What was it that you said? Now you're turning on your own boss? I know where he is. Fucking snitch. Shh! Where's that? In Mexico? Disneyland? Where? No, no. He's hiding in the jungle, my brother. He went there because he doesn't trust banks or any of those things anymore. Sir, you could find him. You just got yourself killed, fucker. Silence! Lift up, lift up your little face. Is this guy telling me the truth? Does anyone else out here want to try to assault a police officer? Or tell fairy tales about Mr. Lorea? Huh? Take them to the trucks. I'll go after her. Get up there with the bikes, now! Move! Move! Santiago? Santiago? Santiago, where are you? Yes, Diego? I don't know where I am. But she escaped. I lost her. - What were you doing there? - Warning my brother. Jesus. You said it was going down at noon, - and it's ten fucking thirty. - It wasn't my bust. - It was never my bust. - He changed it. - They took him? - I don't know. They took my brother, and you have to get him out. - Get him out? - Yes. You're lucky he's still alive. But he won't be alive for very long. You never should've let your idiot brother get involved with this shit. What if I told you I know? I know where Lorea is. I know where the money is. How long have you known? Three months. And why wouldn't you tell me that? Because I'm just your informant, right? That's all I am? If you've got something to tell me, right now is the time to do it. I... was given a promotion. I deliver vans full of money... to Lorea's house in the jungle. That's where he keeps the money. His house is a safe. And just so you know, Lorea pays Diego and all of those men that hired you way too much money. They've just been watching you chase your tail. But now, maybe, you can actually do something. Your government has put a lot of time, money, and training into all of you, and it does not want to lose that investment. Over the next few weeks, you will be bombarded with offers to take your skill set and use them in the private sector. I was suckered into the same thing. That's what I'm here to say, that I have never had a feeling as pure or proud as completing a mission with our flag on my shoulder. Stay where you belong. Thank you. Good luck. How many times have you given that speech? It'll be 173. Still keeping count of everything in your life? Of course. - It's still a good speech. - Thank you. How you been? I'm okay. You? Did you get my text? Yeah. So? What's your take? Who else do you have? I came to you first. If you can get Redfly, I'll do it. Really? Yeah. Do you think he's up for it? I just feel like we owe him. Besides... it's always a little harder than you think it's gonna be, right? Get the captain, I'm in. So... this is three bedroom... and one and a half baths. Nice view out the back window here. Gets good light. Kitchen's right this way. They're asking $120,000. - I think there's some flexibility there. - Yeah. I don't think this is the one for us. Thank you, though. All right, thank you. Hey, I'm lookin' for a condo. I hear you're the guy to talk to. - Sorry to track you down like this. - Hey, man. I called your office. - It's good to see you. - Good to see you. - You look great. - Ah, yeah, right. - No, you do. - It's been a while, huh? Well, we didn't hear from you for a couple of years. We thought you might have gone full native in the jungle. Yeah, I know. Sorry. So, how are you? Uh... I'm okay. Yeah, I heard about you and Molly. Yeah. It happens. So, I got a job for you. Guaranteed 17 grand for a week of consulting. No action unless you want it. It's just a recce. I'm retired. I know. What is it? We're gonna get Gabriel Martin Lorea. Haven't you been trying to do that for years? Yes. I could never find him, and I finally did. I can't do it, man. There's more of this shit around now than ever. Anthony was down here trying to get me to go to Africa for a month, - but I... I can't... I can't do it. - I need you on this one. - It's less than a week of work. - I would love to. God knows I could use the money, but I'm supporting two households right now. There's potential for significant upside on this. Will you just take a look at my work on it? - Are you going to Benny's fight? - Yeah. I gotta pick up Tess. I'm late. Molly's gonna kill me. - Just ride with me, okay? - All right. Molly's still letting you over here, even after the split? Only in the garage. I'm sorry. Tess! - Still drink? - Oh, yeah. Want a beer? Ah, shit. You sleeping with this woman? The accountant, the bean counter who gave you all the information. I'm guessing she's hot. What's that supposed to mean? Oh, well, I just noticed, over the years, your informants tend to be very attractive women. No, I'm not. Why not? It's a fucked-up enough situation as it is. Hey, babe. Hey, Tess! Santiago. Wow, so grown up, man. Oh, I don't know about that. I made 17 grand my first year in the service, man. If you told me then I'd be passing that up for a week's work... Don't worry about her, she's 15. She's not listening to a word we say. Seventeen grand is just for the recce. But if we decide to move forward, this could be a whole lot more than that. I've cut a deal with the agency down there. We keep 25% of anything we seize. I've got estimates he's got over $75 million in cash with him. - Holy shit. - Yeah. Let's say the money is there. How do we get paid? 'Cause this shit is serious, and it takes real planning. And you know that. I've got a lawyer in St. John's who set up an offshore shell security operation that's ready to pay out a salary and bonuses for the rest of our lives. It'll just come in like any other paycheck. Will you take a look at my work on it? No, I don't want to see that because then I can't unsee it. This operation is... illegal, right? This is not illegal. My company's under contract to an agency of a foreign government. And besides, even if it was illegal, most of the live fire you've done's been against the Geneva Convention, technically, so... Come on, you're a better salesman than that. This is a very different thing. I'll be right back. So you're trying to get him to go back to work? Maybe. Why? No reason. You think your mom would still let him go? My mom? Of course. She's not the problem. He hasn't worked since they forced him to retire. Your dad's a good man. You shouldn't be too hard on him. So, I guess you'll just keep selling condos, and I'll run and gun until my knees finally blow out. Or you could do this without me. I could. But I don't wanna, 'cause I say we deserve better, man. How many times did we fly around with 20 million bucks at our feet to pay off some cockroach somewhere, and we never took a dime? - Hell, you've been shot four times. - Five. You've been shot five times for your country, and you can't even afford a new truck. That's the real crime. - Good to see you, Tess. - Good to see you. - You coming back? - Yeah, I'll be back in 20. I gotta drop her off. Is Ironhead in? Only if you are. - Just take a look. - Fine. I'll take a look. Leave my truck outta this. This isn't about my truck. Yes, it is. That's exactly what this is about! - Your mom will pick you up, okay? - Yep. Hey! I love you. I miss you. - What'd he say? - He's taking a look at it. He may not be up for this. You know he's the best with something this complex. And he needs this right now. All right. This shit is fuckin' depressing. C'mon. Let your brother have some fun. Support him. I've been supporting him since the day he was born. That kid's a one-in-a-million talent, going out there, playing the fucking clown to a bunch of hillbillies. Ah, yeah, where are my corner men? Holy shit, look who it is! What's up, Benny? Oh, holy shit! Oh, God! Hell of a night for you to show. - It's great to see you, man. - You as well. Hey! Every day you're uglier. Ah, you little shithead. Good to see you. Did you boys get my text? Yeah? Fish? I need a pilot. I can't do this thing without you. I don't know, man. I got the new baby now, and my lady isn't into me doing this kinda shit anymore. What... What does that mean? Did you read the text? This can change you and that baby's life forever. What happened to that bullshit about going back to your mother's homeland and empowering the people to police themselves? Anyway, I lost my license. I can't even fly right now. Well, I don't need a pilot with a license. I'm in with the army down there. I just need a pilot I can trust. Yeah, I don't think so. Okay. Lorea is destroying that country. So we get to take out a very bad man, and, oh, by the way, there's a winning lottery ticket stuck to the bottom of your cowboy boot. Every guy in that gym would jump at this. Come on, focus, guys! It's fight night. Yeah, don't worry about that bullshit. Sorry, Benny. You ready for this? Hell yeah. Let's go. - I didn't mean to call your shit bullshit. - It's all right. I got busted. It's not a big deal. Actually, it's a big deal. Coke? Jesus, Frankie. Technically, it's a suspension. I'm still under review. Well, what about you? What are you gonna do? I said if Redfly's in, I'm in. - Come on, stick with me here, guys. - Oh, I'm with you, Benny. But are you with me? Are you in? You know I am. I go where you go. That's what I thought. Benny stands tall. From Red Feather Lakes, Colorado, standing six foot three, weighing in at 195 pounds, I bring you... Ben Miller! Go, Ben! Come on! Let's go, Benny! Cheers, man. Benny, take it easy! Nice and slow! I took a look at your folder. It's good work. Thank you. You need five guys and a pilot. Yeah, Benny! Go! Get him, Benny! What's up, brother? The only thing missing is your entry plan. I have a full set of bullshit passports waiting for us. We go through immigration as power line consultants. Once we're in-country, they don't have any facial recognition cameras yet, so... we're ghosts. So what's the verdict? I'm in for the recce if you guys are. - You sure? - Yeah, just the recce though. No live fire. - That's all right. - Okay. Fish? When is it? We leave Thursday. Okay. And here we go! Come on, Benny! Let's go! All right, it's time to work. Come on, Benny! Comms. Pass those out. We're in Lorea's backyard. So what's this guy got against banks? At least a safe. The house is the safe. I'm at the gate. This looks like everything was done about 82% right. They got all the toys out here, but these cameras aren't even aimed at the weakest breach point. Your girlfriend's making her normal money drop? Yeah. She's prepared to record the inside of the house. Pope... Pope, I have kids over here. Does he have kids living in here with him? 'Cause that's gonna make things a whole lot more complicated and is not what I signed up for. The family's not the problem. They're the answer. Why? Church. Lorea's very devout. Every Sunday morning, he sends three guards to the 6:00 a.m. service. When they get back, he sends the rest of the team, along with his family, into town to mass. That leaves him and three guards in that house, and that's our window. Why would he do that? Worried about someone taking his kids. And he never leaves his money. Also, I don't think he believes anyone actually has the balls to come out here and rob him. It's probably 'cause it's a stupid idea. Pope, I got your girlfriend coming up right now. Holy shit. She is beautiful, man. I fucking knew it. Fuck off. God damn. I got an execution about to go down over here. Are you at the tennis courts? Yeah. Yeah, that's his spot. Perdóname, padre. Why is she doing this? She hopes I can get her little brother out of jail. Did you put him in jail? - Not really. - Buenas. I'm guessing that's putting her at some risk. Man, I almost forgot why I got out of this business. Shit gets so dark so quick. Oh, shit, we got ground sensors here, boys. Did you hit one? I don't know, I'm not sure. Benny, I got two guys on motorbikes coming your way. Hold tight, Benny. I'm trying to get out there to cover you. Good afternoon, Mr. Lorea. A stock boy job at Walmart's starting to look pretty good right now, boys. It looks good to me. Good. Okay. Thank you, sir. I'm clear. They're coming back to you. Let's get the fuck outta here. You were gonna piss yourself. I was getting onto the déjà vu part, man. So what's the plan? Are their guys prepared to operate across the border? What's the scope of this thing? Sunday soft hit is the way to do it. Otherwise, you bring in an army, you'd start a fucking war up there. Mm-hmm. So, when do you need to present to the agency down here? I'm not sure I wanna tell them. Why? We saw the place. It's full of holes. So maybe we don't tell them... ...and we do this thing ourselves. What? What? Now, we each took 17 grand... to help the narcotics unit map out and plan this fuckin' thing. I told you I wasn't even comfortable helping them do it. Now you want us to do it by ourselves? Kill a bunch of fuckin' narcos? If we hit that window, like you said, when they're at church, nobody but Lorea gets killed. And I'm okay with that. Does the agency down here even know about this? - What do you mean? - Come on, man! Don't fuck around. Who paid our fees? It's complicated, technically... you guys were paid through an LLC. Mm, no, not that complicated. It's $100,000. Where the fuck did it come from? I'll get the bill. Thanks. Great trip, boys. It's turning out to be some full-on cowboy shit. Whose money is it, huh? - It was my money. - Jeez. What were you thinking? What? Does that change anything? Yeah, man. You fucking lied to us. No, I didn't lie to you. I asked you guys to come down here, do reconnaissance, and make a plan. Now, we can execute that plan alone and take all of the money, or you guys can fuck off, and I'll bring the team from down here in. But I assure you, if I do that, this fucker will find out about it, and he'll be gone, and I need this guy. You know how many fucking bad men are out there all over the world? Yeah, well, this is my last one. And you may not believe it, but I have been here for the last three years of my life, trying to make a difference, but it's a fucking mess. And it's all because of Lorea. The thought of leaving everything we've done behind for the last 17 years, with nothing to show for it... Fuck you, nothing to show for it. Look, if... If we had accomplished half the things that we've accomplished in any other profession, we'd be set for life. Hey, man, that's the deal we cut. - Well, it's a shitty deal. - Yeah, well... Because this man's a goddamn hero, and he can't even send his kids to college. And Fish's the most talented pilot I know, and he's grounded on a bullshit coke rap. And how many times can your brother get the shit knocked out of him for... I didn't get the shit beat out of me. I won that fight. Sorry, Benny. And how many more pep talks can you possibly give? I'm done, man. Both knees are shot. That neck operation I got last year made the whole thing worse. So, the question is, do we finally get to use our skills for our own benefit and actually change something? So, are we doing this? How the fuck am I supposed to know? This guy doesn't come through with the one key piece of intel we need to make this decision. For all we know, she could be setting us up to get her brother back. We'll know tomorrow. She should have been recording that whole thing today. All right, if it does come back clean, how would you do the Sunday morning version? - I haven't thought about it. - Bullshit, you can't help yourself. All right. In the first pop, you'd have 40 minutes to get in, get the job done, and get out before the family comes home from church. That's a hard out. We need to breach the fence, sweep the premises, find and subdue the guards, scrub the hard drives in the security room, get rid of Lorea, find the money, pack the money into 18 hundred-pound bags, and then hoof it half a mile to the nearest vehicle. There's only two ways out: the fence in the front, or over the mountain we came down, and I'm too old for that. We need to use one of their vans. There were two vans in the courtyard. But if the family uses those vans to go to church, then we got nothing. So we need another van. - Can your girl work that out? - I can ask her. Still got your aviation guy down here? 'Cause we would need a heavy-lift helicopter in 32 hours to get us over the Andes and to the ocean. I don't know, but I'll give him a call. Oh, yeah! Big dog is back! Redfly's gonna be rich, boys! Now we're talkin'. Hello. Hola. ¿Señor? Thank you. Have a good day. - Thank you. - That's it? I don't know. Miss, two coffees, please. - My brother. - Yeah. I might need you to do one more thing for me. Can you get an extra van... into the compound, Sunday morning? If I did that, they're going to know it's me. And everyone who works for him ends up dead, sooner or later. If you can get me an extra van in there Sunday morning... I will get you and your brother out of the country with new papers and money. How much? Two million. Two million? Yes. And you'll only have a couple hours to get my brother? I'll find a way. But I need that van inside those gates. Okay. - Yeah? - Yes. I'll get the van. But if we're not gone forever after you make your move, we are dead. You'll be gone. Yeah. Thank you. Hey, fellas. Take a look at this. Jesus, Pope! - What the hell were you planning here? - Exactly this. Every single gun, bullet, and fucking toothpick here's been sourced in-country. The idea is to pin this on a local rival gang. Now, who was it that didn't trust this lady? 'Cause not only is she going to get us that extra van, but she got us this. There's our man, Lorea. And, oh! Look at what's there behind him. Looks like money to me. - There's gotta be about 35 million there. - We don't know that. Whatever it is, it's a lot. What are you gonna do with your share, huh? Never spend your money until it's in your pocket, Benjamin. Well, I'm just sayin', I'm gonna get that Ferrari, man. - How original. - What about the bird? Well, he said if we're there with three million bucks, he'll be there. So we got a bird, we got a van, we got Lorea confirmed in the house with the money. All right, give me... give me a minute. Uh, you know, if you had pulled this shit when we were active duty, I would have court-martialed your ass. Look, why don't we all just have a dinner tonight, get drunk, on me, and you all can go home in the morning? Nah, fuck that. I can't. Somehow, I just... ...ended up against it here. You know? I'm burning through my pension. Molly's job doesn't cut it. I can't sell condos to save my fucking life. The only thing I have is taking care of these girls. Yeah. Yeah, I understand that. Fuck, I missed this. It's like they take your best 20 years, and then spit you out. Yeah. I just can't stop thinking about the mistakes. - What mistakes? - Fuck, man. All of 'em. - Didn't get better when you got out? - No. Only thing that made it feel better is when you put a gun in my hand. So, I guess that's what we'll do. All right, first things first: safety. There is no medevac. There is no ground support. Any injuries we sustain, we're walking out with. Be mindful, each of you has a medical kit in your bag. Number two: you cannot go back to your normal life after tonight. Make no mistake about it. What we are about to do is criminal. We do not have the flag on our shoulders, and no amount of bullshit that we tell ourselves is gonna change that. If we do our job right, we will be committing one murder and one armed robbery. You guys need to own the fact that you are desecrating most of the oaths you ever took. Third: family. If they don't go to church, or if they come home early, it's an abort. Full stop. They are not who we came for. And lastly, it's not too late to go home. We had an agreement with Pope, and we fulfilled that. Any man here who wants to walk away now can do so knowing they're the best of us. But it's gotta be now. I wanna make sure we're not leaving that house without taking care of Lorea. If he's there like he's supposed to be, we'll get him. We leave at 0300. Hooah. It's a good thing these guys are so devout. Our dad used to say, "When it's raining, it means God didn't need us in church today." He also said you go to heaven for the climate and hell for the company. Actually, I think Mark Twain said that. All right, keep the radio clear, let's stay awake here. How many is that getting in? Count it. Seven getting in the van. Anybody see Lorea? Negative. We never saw him come out. The wife and two kids are in with a single driver. The family's left the building. Repeat, family are all clear. All right, let's get ready here. Damn, Pope, this lady is a keeper. Punctual, smart, and brave as shit. - Good day. - What's this? I'm here to drop off this van, and then my brother is taking me home. That idiot didn't tell me. She's in. She's in. Here we go. Ben, you're first hit. Call when it's secure. With this rain, the guards are gonna be inside. Roger. - All clear, she's gone. - Copy. All right, we're going in. Front gate secure. One guard secured in the kitchen. - Ben, come to the house. - Roger. I'm at the front door. Hold, Benny. Hold. Threat in the TV room. We're gonna go around the side. What's going on in there? All clear, Benny. Eyes out for Lorea. He sure as fuck heard us now. I'm coming in. Setting charges to the security room. What was that? We had to shoot the second guard in the leg. - They're taking him to the kitchen. - Coming down. Come on. Fuse is burning. Any trace of him? She said he never leaves. We got nothing. This guy's a ghost. Everyone to the office, right now. What the fuck? And Lorea? Nothing. A couple of bags. He's gone. With the money. Your girl gave us up, Pope. We gotta get the fuck outta here. No, no, no, no, no, no. What's that smell like to you? Like a serious fuck-up. No. Paint. The house is the safe. The house is the fucking safe. Benny, help me move this. Come on. - I'll take the edge. - Over there. Go, come on. Come on, man. Come on! - Holy shit! - Come on. Go. Move, move. C'mon. - Oh, my God! - Fish, I'm up. Come on, guys! Holy shit! What'd I tell you, boys? Jesus Christ! Fucking God! Look at it! - It goes all the way up! - Let's go! We're gonna need some bags. - I'll get another bag! - Keep it coming. What's wrong? If the money's still here, it means he's still here. He's gone, man. We got more! Back wall, too. Just concentrate. Oh, we're just gettin' rich! How much time we got? Eight minutes. Millers, enough of that over there. We gotta start getting this shit to the van. Yeah, we got this. - Come on, bro. - Keep your eyes open. Yeah, bitches! Here, take these. I'm gonna go get the van. - Meet me there. - Yes, sir. Careful. Classic. Jesus Christ. - Help us, man! - Come on! Come on! Come on. Over there. Holy shit! We're gonna need more bags. See if you can find something. On it. I tell you one thing, man, you can tell your girls they can stop studying 'cause Daddy's just gonna buy their way into Harvard! Holy shit, this is a fuckload of money! Grab some of those and go. How are we on time? We got time for a couple more loads. - You sure? - Grab those and bring 'em down. Guys! I got another wall over here! - Holy shit! - Shit! It's everywhere. Well, fuck me! It's the whole fucking house. What's up? The van's full, man! It's all good. We gotta go. What the hell are you doing? Stop digging more out. We got all this to deal with. A couple more loads. You know, in the ten years I've been working with you, Tom, you have never missed a hard out! I gave us a 15-minute cushion. It's 12 minutes to the church, a 40-minute service, 12 minutes back. Add 5 minutes to load in and out of the van, and we can subtract 7 to beat them to the exit route. We will be fine! All right? God damn it, look at all this money! Just a couple more loads! Fuck this! Time's up. We gotta go. I want one more sweep for Lorea. All right? And then we burn it all down. Okay, I'll get these last one loaded down there, and you call out when you're ready to light it up. Move. Move! Come on, we gotta go! Lighting it up. What are we shooting at in here? Is that Lorea? He's dead. Good. I'm hit. Shit! - Take it easy. - Where? Left side. Did it go through? Yeah, it went through. - I'll be fine. - It'll be okay. - Get the clot kit. - Straight through. You'll be okay. You'll be all right. Just breathe. I'm okay. All right. Let go. - Told you this was a stupid idea. - Yeah, you sure did. Sunday school's over, boys. They're back. Oh, shit! - The family? - No, the first shift of guards. - You okay? - I'm all right. You gonna be able to move? - We don't got a stretcher. - Yeah. Just help me get my kit back on. All right, we can each take a backpack of cash, we go out through the back into the jungle, and we're gone. - I'll cover the cost of the operation. - Fuck that. No.We are bringing Ironhead home safe. Not dragging him through the jungle. And we're not leaving them any of this fucking money. Right, so we burn it all down and go. There's about $100 million for them waiting in the van out there. We need to hunt and shoot quickly. Call out your kills. I don't want any fuckin' surprises. - Got it? - All right. Let's do this. You two go that way, we'll come down the front. I'm all right. Let's just do it. All right. All right. Let's go. Here we go, fellas. That's two down in the front hall. That's three. That's four. Get back to the gate. I'm sure they dropped a few guys out there. On the way. Anybody got eyes on that SUV the guards came in? Because we're gonna need it. I'm already loading it up. Is everybody out of there? - Coast's clear. - All clear. Another van of guys just passed me in the driveway. Catfish is coming around with the van. What are you doing? Come on! Let's go! Benny! Hey! Let's go, man! Hustle! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! - What? - What do you mean, what? That was a shit job back there, man. We don't leave messes like that! What do we do up here? I've got the family waiting to go in. Take it slow. Your girlfriend's here. - Did you get out okay? - Yes. We're almost there. Help me. Vamos. Just load 'em up, and I'll weigh 'em. - Where's your guy? - He'll be here. What the fuck we gonna do with that thing? William. - Habibi. - Kaifa halak? - You made it. - Count on me. Mosquito bite? Yeah, a little one. Feels worse than it looks. Now how the hell are we all gonna fit in that? - Come when you're ready. - Copy. Feel free to count it. I know where to find you. Voilà! It won't all fit in the net! We gotta get the rest on it inside! I don't know if that scale's fucked up, but he's telling me we got 6,000 pounds here. That's $250 million. We stole 250 million? I'm definitely getting that Ferrari! - Are you sure? - Let's go! If that scale is even close to being right, we're gonna have a weight issue. What's the issue? This helo can carry 9,000 pounds. That's 9,000 at 2,000 feet. If we want to get to the ocean, we gotta fly over the fucking Andes, man. Are we really leaving $200 million on the fucking runway? Okay, she'll make it. Let's go! What's your plan for her? We're already overweight as it is. We promised them a ride over the border into Peru. And we're gonna stand by that! Okay, we're gonna let you go now. Thank you. I just need to know something. What's my name? I... I don't know. What about your buddy back there? What's his name? I don't know. He said he couldn't tell me. Okay, I want you to be real careful... about what you're about to say because the only thing that ties us to them is you. Now, when you finally had sex, and you rolled over and looked him in the eye and said, "What's your real name?" What did he say? That never happened. I can just go ask him. He never told me where he was from. He said that you served together... and that you were honest. Why'd he say that? Because I asked him if... if he wasn't afraid of you cheating him. That's why. Everything all right? No! Here's three million dollars. And two tickets with visas to Sydney, Australia. On the way to the airport, stop at this shipping company. Make sure to send the boxes to this hotel in Sydney. You know that's a lot more than 75 million dollars in there. What does that mean? It's not just Lorea's money in there. A lot more people are gonna come looking after you. I can deal with that. But do not stay in South America because they will find you and they will kill you. Promise me that you won't stay here. - Yes! - Promise me! I promise you. How... How do I contact you? You can't. You did everything right. You deserve this. Take care of yourselves. Thank you. Go! She's lying. No, she's not. There are consequences to this shit. You know what we should have done? That's one you wouldn't come back from. The weight drags at higher altitudes. I'd like to stay under 5,000 feet till we hit the Andes. Ocean in four hours. Roger that. Nice work. I'm gonna try between these two bigger peaks. Find this valley I saw on the map. Roger. Just one last push through the Andes. How high do you think that is? It's gotta be 11,000. Can't fly that high. Shouldn't have to. Head for that lower ridge. How are we doing up here, boys? Can we make it over? I don't know. What the fuck is going on up here? Go for it. All right, baby. All right, baby. Come on, now. All right, baby. - We're redlining, man. - It's close, though. It's too much weight. It's too much fucking weight. We're never gonna make it. - What does that mean? - It means we're losing fucking money. You wanna leave $50 million in the middle of the jungle? Do you wanna get to the ocean? All right, go do it. I got it! All right, let me check. How's she feeling now? That's feeling better. Come on. Come on. Come on. What the fuck are you doing, Catfish? One of the gearboxes is blown. What? I don't want to go into a spin. Okay, we might be in trouble here. I'm losing altitude. Ah, we should land. We should land now. Crash-land here, and we all die. I'm trying to get her back to flat. Roger. Prepare for a hard landing! There should be a farmer's field on the other side of that ridge. - We passed it on the way up. - I remember it. I can't land this with that bag under us. We should lose the money, maybe we don't die. Lose the money, or we're all gonna die! Hit the external load release. It's on the wall! Pull the lever, Ben! It didn't work! There should be a manual override on the cargo hook. Let me through! Benny! All right, I'm gonna try to land here. I gotta jump! Benny! Bad landing. Fish! Fish! - You all right? - Yeah, I think so. I think so. Yo, Benny! Benny! - I'm here! - Come on, we gotta move. Come on! Let's get our shit outta here. Try and get up to it. - Fish! - I need oxygen. Everybody okay? Yeah. Whoa, whoa! - They're into the fucking net. - What's the plan here? We're gonna get that money over that mountain to the ocean. Benny, cover us from under that tree line there. Fish, you take position up there. That's cocaine they're growing, so they may have weapons trained on us from those buildings right there. We got working radios? - No, comms are dead. - Go with hand signals. Pope and I will get out there and look as peaceful as we can. We'll give you a hand signal when we think it's secure. - Let's move. - Benny. Please step back. Sirs! Step back, please, that is not yours. Who are you? Who are you with? We're with the army. We are advisers. You should call a rescue helicopter. - It's coming. - Yes. In the meantime, you are alone and don't have any uniforms. Okay, that can be resolved. But what about the other passengers from the accident? We can talk about that. But tell your people to stop stealing our property. These are our lands. You fucked up, DEA. No, no, no. Calm down. Calm down. Sir, careful with that weapon. - We're not DEA. We're not DEA. - We are calm. - Tell your guy to put his gun down. - Stay calm. Stop. Pope, what's he reaching for? A weapon? Pope, do you cop... Stay right there. Don't get any closer. Fuck! What the hell, man? No! - Assholes! Murderers! - Get out of there! Get away from the money! Get away from there! - Fuck! - No! We need horses or mules, please, and then we will get out of here. Benny, get these people back up toward the village. Fish, get this money on some mules. Let's get the fuck out of here. Get back! Get up! Get up! Get up, lady! Send me to God. Go! Keep going! Fuck. All right, let's get these donkeys saddled up, get the bags on 'em. Where's Pope? He's up there. That is for the mules. That is for the families. That is for you. Are we in agreement? Good. We're very sorry for what happened. And we very much appreciate your cooperation. Come on. Sorry, kid. Those men have paid their debt! Let them pass. Did you pay for the damage? Yeah. How much? Two hundred for the animals. A million for the families. Which one of you shot first? I don't know. We need to watch ourselves here. Yeah, we do. What the hell does that mean? Nothin'. It just means we gotta watch ourselves, that's all. Roger that. How far have we gone? We've gone about 12 clicks. To get to the boat, it's another day and a half, maybe two. Well, a fire would be righteous. Lorea's guys will be on our tail. Smoke from a fire will give us away. We cold camp. Well, we're dancing with the devil now. Dancing? We were dancing when we got on the plane to come down here. I would call this full intercourse. How you doing, bud? Golden. Here. You're a good man, Benny. We're a dyin' breed, boys. No, we're not. The world's always going to need somebody to go door-to-door to hold the line. Cops go door-to-door and hold the line. We were warriors. Well, it's hard to remember that sometimes. Yeah, it is. What are you talking about? I was too quick on the trigger. You know it, and I know it. I killed those people. No, you didn't. We all did. This is definitely the old smuggler's trail! We should just keep following it all the way up. Come on. Stop pushing on me, man. It's steep here. Obviously, man, we're on the side of a fucking mountain! Just shut up and concentrate! Jesus Christ! - Come on, just go. - Fuck you. Oh, really? Keep going! - Stop. - You wanna do this? Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Oh, fuck! What the fuck are you laughing at? That was a living animal, man. It could have been any one of us. You're worried about the fucking donkey? You need to get your shit straight here, man. - What? Me? - Yeah, you. You're pointing fingers at me? - You're the reason we're in this mess. - Oh, how the fuck is that? Yeah, you had to grab every dollar you could get your hands on, didn't you? You could have gotten Lorea two months ago! We didn't need to be here. All right. Fucking bullshit! We're all on the hook, are we not? God damn this fucking horse! Stop it! - Yes. It's fine. - Relax. Relax. We're not picking at the fucking scab right now, okay? One foot in front of the other. All right? Come on. Let's go. Jesus fucking Christ. Oh, come on. Are you sure you want me to get rid of the mules? This rock side's 20-foot deep. We're not getting the mules through. Yeah, it's on us now! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Look at the mules. Well, if we can get over this, it should be all downhill to the ocean from here. I got it. I got it. I got it. All right, come on up! - Nice work. - You, too. Look, I talked a lot of shit back there. I didn't mean that. - Don't worry about it. - No, no, it's... This is on me. - It's... all on me. - No, man, it's... I'm on the hook for this. You know? It is what it is. Yeah, it is what it is. I am a bit of a dick, though. You could freeze an Eskimo's asshole out here. I demand a fire. We cold camp. Fuck you. This is my "fuck you" money. Dude, what the fuck are you doing? We don't have enough men to carry this money, so we might as well be warm. Oh, Jesus. Jesus Christ. Ah. - That's more like it. - Este loco... Oh! Oh, my God! Holy shit. Now that's a fire! - Oh, shit! Shit. - Ah, Fuck. I'm hit! - Benny, you all right? - Yeah, I'm fine. Just grazed my shoulder. Shooter's up on the ridge line. Oh, he likes me so much. I'll stay here, hold his fire. You guys go around the side. Pope, can you step out? Work up the trailhead. All right. Flank right, make sure no one else is coming up below. I'll cut up behind you. Benny, you all right? Yeah, I'm fine. We'll hold down here until you get into position. I think Pope's in position right now. Yeah, let's move. Tom! Tom! Tom. Come on... Come on. Come on, Tom. Come on, man. Come on, man. Come on... Let me see. Let me see. Oh, my God! Let's get him wrapped up. We need to keep moving. What the fuck are you talking about? You're a heartless son of a bitch! It was your little fire that got him fucking killed! Stop it. Stop this shit. Stop this shit. Fucking stop this! Stop this shit! Stop it! - Stop this shit! - Fuck you, Benny! Fuck you! It wasn't the fire that gave us away. That kid was from the village. He's been tracking us for days. He obviously wanted a clear shot at Tom. He wanted him. But we do have to get the fuck out of here, and we are taking all of that money with us. Tom's family deserves it! And so do we. All right, let's wrap him up. We carry him down. Rest in peace, brother. You rest in peace. How late are we to meet the guy with the boat? Five days. Jesus. You think he's still there? I can't see shit. We need to get one of us down there. Think one of you can make it there and back? I'll go. Your Spanish sucks, Benny. I got it. You sure? Three? Yeah. You're looking for the Hijo Pródigo. Benny, watch your six. You watch yours. I'm gonna say something. Are you listening? Yeah. We gotta get back on our game. Enough of this. It stops now. You understand? Copy that. Good. How many people do you think you've killed? What? You heard me. As many as I had to. Why would you ever wanna know that? - Forty-three. - Jesus! Confirmed. You keep count of everything, huh? Yep. How's your sleep? I guess better than it should be. You all right? The boat's there. I gave him half the money. I hope he waits. I didn't go into town, but it looks like whoever's in charge there... has a... kindergarten army that's looking for us. - How many of them? - Two or three pros, 20 heavily-armed teenagers. What about the next town over? It's over 100 miles to the south. I'm sure they've got every town covered anyway. Must be what's left of Lorea's guys. So we go through 'em. Through them? What, do you mean we mow them all down? What's the alternative here? I'm not prepared to wipe out every teenager in that town just to get through with this cargo. This cargo? What about that cargo? Will you do it for him? Tom died for this money, and we're not leaving this country without it! He didn't die for that money, he died because of it! They're just kids, man. Can't we carry it out through the dark? It's over 100 bags. There's no way. Let me talk to him. Look, Benny's telling us these are kids, man. I can't believe... I can't believe I let this happen. Look, we all came here of our own free will. Yeah, but... I thought we could... I thought we could do this. Yeah. And we got what we deserved. I'm sorry. Yeah, me, too. - But we can't do this. - I know. I know. We can't just... go through 'em. I don't know what I was saying. It's all right. We've just gotta get Tom home. That's all that matters. How are we gonna do that? We keep carrying him down. We fill our days packs with whatever we can... Whatever we can carry, and that's it. What do we do with the rest of it? Fuck. Fuck me. That'll work. Snow will be coming in soon. Nobody'll ever see it again. Good. All right, let's keep going. Let's put him down for a second. We're running behind. Benny, you should go. The sun's coming up. We'll meet you down at the cove in 30. - All right. Be careful. - Always. Thank you for waiting. The boat is ready. No, wait. Whoa. Is there anyone? - It looks abandoned. - Cover me. Stop! Hands up! - Stop! - Put your hands up! Wait! Wait! Listen! Little brother, be careful with that gun. Don't point it at me. I speak English! What's in the bag? What is that? It's our friend. - He's dead. - I call boss. - No, don't do that. - Stop! We don't have any problem with you. Right, guys? - We don't have a problem with him. - No problem. - I'm taking a shot. - No! No. Don't do that. It's okay. Uh-uh. Hey, calm down. This is 16! I need help! Dumbass! - Where are the keys? - I don't know. They just left me here with just the car and the radio. Fuck! - Are you sure? - Yes. Are you lying? Hey, hey, kid, just relax, all right? Sixteen? Sixteen, is that you? We're going to send someone. Yes! Fuck yes! Let's move. Let's get it outta here. - Grab his radio. - Got it. Here's a little advice: Get away from these men. Let's move! Go home. Get out of here. Vamos, Pope! Did you give that fucking kid money? We should have killed that kid as soon as he saw our faces. We are not killing any more people. I'll tell you right now, if we get to that beach and Ben isn't there, I'm fucking killing people. All right, he'll be there. Fuck! Shit. Fuck. - Come on! Come on! - Can we go? What the hell is this? Shit! They crashed into us! Look out, be careful! - They're heading to the beach. - They just passed. - Everybody head towards the palm trees. - What did he say? - More are coming. - There's two vehicles! All right, it should open up onto the beach any minute. Pope, shoot! Fuck! Shoot the driver! What is wrong with you? Give some room! - Left! - They're firing! Stay behind! They're right on us! Where are they? Left! Left! Left! Goddamn! All right, here's the beach. Where is he? Do you see him? No, but the cove where we're supposed to meet him's about a mile up this beach. Pope, kill them! Just kill them! There it is! - Do I wave him in? - Hell yeah! Go! It looks like this is the end of the road. I see it. We gotta cross over the dune! Cross over the dune! Let's go! Come on! Minus the expenses, and our administrative fee, that leaves $5,334,120... cut five ways. Which gives you five shares of $1,066,824. Oh, and I need all of your signatures on the fifth contract here. It'll deposit the deceased's share into the Redfly Family Trust. Here you are. I'd like you to please include my share into the family trust. Me, too. Thank you. So, I will schedule all the payments to the family trust. Of course. - Thank you. That's for you. - Thank you. I'll be in touch. So, what are you guys gonna do now? I gotta get home. Not without these. That'll help. See you. Take care of yourself. See you, buddy. Love you, man. I love you, too. - I'll see you in a bit, all right? - See you. So, what you gonna do now? I don't know. Maybe I'll, uh... I'll go see this girl I know in Australia. Yeah, you should. I hear she recently came into some money. I guess she made out a whole hell of a lot better than any of us did. That seems about right. When you see Molly and the girls... remind them who he was. Yeah, I will. Take care of yourself, all right? You, too. Maybe we can go do something good with it one day.
