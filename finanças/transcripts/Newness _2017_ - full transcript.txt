- Morning. - Hey. - Hi. There is a customer who wants a consultation at the register. - Okay, I'll be two seconds. - Also, you know how today's my last day before I go to med school. - Shit, I didn't realize. - Yeah. I'm having this thing tonight at chacha if you wanna come. - Ah, damn, I'd love to but I can't tonight, i got plans, I'm sorry. But thank you for everything, you've been awesome. - Yeah no, it's fine. It's been great working for you. - You're gonna kill it. - Thank you. - Very good. - Little better. - It hurts some more? You're doing so good. Okay, you don't need me anymore. Just go and have fun. - What's up? - Well she doesn't have her insurance so I don't know what to do. - Is it for you? - No, it's for my mom. She's really sick and it's very expensive, I really need it. - Hey, I'll cover it and then she can pay next time or something. - Are you sure? - Have a good day. - Thank you. - No, thank you. - I just get on my phone and I just start swiping. I like black girls, i like persian girls, I like white girls, i like Asian, well I've never been to the Asian world as you have and sometimes-- - a big ole racist over here. - I'm not racist. - Yeah, you are. - You have your own thing too, man. You love Asian girls, you know. Bethany was clearly Japanese. You wouldn't shut up about her. - I knew she was clearly Japanese, but I married her because I loved her not because I was like, oh I need a Japanese. - How many times did he say, Bethany takowa. Bethany takowa. The whole time. - You like their name, you say it. - But she was Japanese, that's what we're talking about. - She was half Japanese. - Yeah so. - That's his wife man, come on. - My ex, ex wife. - Ex wife, so it shouldn't matter because-- - well yes, but we don't have to talk about her like that, I don't know. - Let's not talk about her. - And you're a lucky man for having an Asian girl, that's all it is. - Thank you, thank you. I'm gonna go to the bathroom, do you need anything? - I'm good. - Alright. - You? - Why'd you bring up Bethany? - Because we talking about fucking persians and blacks and latinas and fucking asians fit in that. - So does he have a job? Does he work, does he make money? - He says he's an instagram model. - An instagram model? - Let's just let that hang there for a second. - What is that? - Instagram model, that's not a job. - Show me his photos. Oh my god, crazy abs. - You have an appetite, you know that? You have an appetite to. - I'm not dating as many people as you are. - I'm not dating as many people, I'm just trying to find someone who can make me cum. - This is a girl's night. - Crazy abs' texting. - Girls? Girl night? - How're you guys doing? - Hi, how are you? - Is everything okay? Try to make sure it's always good for you guys. Are you sure you don't need anything else? - Bye, love you, be safe. - My best friend had met her boyfriend at the time on the app and suggested I try it. Just kind of for fun basically, and I didn't even realize this, but when I moved into the building my best friend at the time was sleeping with the guy on the fifth floor, so she would literally go out and then come to my apartment and I would fluff her hair and then she would go sleep with him and come back. - No. - And then sleep in the same, yeah, they'd tell me all about it. And so you're not a doctor? - No. - You're a pharma dude. - Yeah. - So what's the difference? - Well the doctor, you know is a doctor. - Oh right. - I work in the pharmacy. - Right. - Hey. - What's up? - Oh shit. Oh shit. - Oh god. Do you want to go down on me now? - We kinda just met. Hey I'm gonna go shower. - You okay? - Yeah, yeah. I took too many. - Took too many what? - Klonopin. - How many did you take? - I don't remember. - I'm gonna get you a glass of water. - No, I'm good. - Okay I'll be right back. - Okay. - Let it out, let it out. - Hey! - Hi. - Hey. Sorry. How's it going? - Good. - Yeah? I got a shot of Jameson. - Oh. - Okay? - Perfect, yeah. - Would it be better if you go to my place or? - Oh yeah. But do you want to have a beer before? - Yeah, yeah yeah, of course. Modelo? - Yeah. - That good? Can we get two modelos? - Yeah. - Thank you. How long you been on wings? - A while, I don't know yeah, yeah. How long have you been? - Like six months. I go through phases though, like sometimes I use it and then other times I just. I don't know if I'm a big fan. - Really, why? - I mean to be honest I feel like, 80% of the time i feel like a dildo attached to a warm body. I do, that's the honest truth. People look at me and I'm like, that's it. You're from Spain originally? - Yeah. - Where about? - From Barcelona. I came here for school. - Oh yeah? - And then I like it and then I stayed. Yeah, nine years I've been here. - What were you studying? - I did history and then I did two bachelor degrees. But not just partial like, psychology. - Right. - And then evolutionary biology. - Wow. - They're very different. - That's a lot of school. - Yeah, it's a lot. - Tell me something evolutionarily biological. Most fascinating biological fact. - Yeah one, maybe you know, is that, you know that the tip of the human penis, it's shaped like a mushroom. Well like, some penises are shaped like. - Most, I think, yeah. - Most. So that's just literally because then the penis can scoop out another man's sperm from inside the vagina. - What? - Yeah, they go there and they do like, this is my thing, this is my place, just fuck off. - It's like a weird pooper scooper for jizz. - Yeah. - Wow. And then what else? You studied all three of those, you still in school, no? - No no, I'm working now. - Where you working? - I'm a physical therapy assistant. - Okay cool. - Maybe this is the problem, I don't know, but I really like new things. You know, constant newness. - Right. - When there's something new, I'm really into it, I go for it and then after a while I ditch it. Like I don't like it anymore, I get bored, whatever, so, I just go like, okay whatever. You know? - Yeah, I get that. - It's hard for me to really know what I want to do. - You just gotta start doing something, right? I mean at some point i had to leave school and press play and real life. - You have pressed play? - I haven't pressed play, I kinda, I just, I unplugged the console and threw it out the window, and just stopped playing because I was like, this game's rigged. Wanna have another beer here? - Yeah. - Yeah? - The other way? - Other way. - Red. - Red. See. - Red, wait wait wait. - That one. - Go ahead, click an image to select. - Which one? - Oh my god! - Come on, let's get out of here. Let's go. How'd you get an uber, you what? - No, I bike. - You bike? - No, I hitchhike. - You hitchhiked here? No, I came like this. - Okay. You walked like that the whole way here? - Yes. - I believe it. Okay, let's go. Come on. - I was on another date earlier tonight. I thought you should know. - Oh, did you guys? - Yeah. We were safe, but you know it's like a. - Yeah. - Date. - I mean, I was with, i was on another date, too. But we didn't hook up, no it kinda went south before that. - Okay. Well maybe I should go and then. - You hungry? - Yeah. - You like ramen? There's a place around the corner, it's open. - Yeah, I bet. Is this weird? - Why? Because of the other guy? - Yeah, is it okay? - No, it's not weird. Yeah I got my mushroom penis. - Okay. - So your dad is American. - No my mom. My mom's America but, they met in Spain and then they fell in love and then my mom moved there, and then la la la la boom, I'm born. - La la la la boom, that's the Spanish for baby making? - Yeah. - You wanna have kids? - Yeah, i wanna have kids. - Yeah. - Yeah. But I don't want to get married. - No? - Who gets married? - I did, I got married. - You were married? - Yeah, briefly, yeah. - How was it? - Brief. - My sister just got married now. - Oh she did? - Yeah. In Spain, she's so in love. - Did you go? - Yeah. But it was kinda sad, you know. Because it remind me how much I miss them. - What about you? - What about me what? - Have you ever been in love? - Yeah I think so. I mean, when people, they say they are in love it's because they think they're in love, right? So, yeah. Yeah. - You pee in sinks? - No. - You don't pee in sinks? - You pee in sinks? - Oh yeah, I pee in sinks. - That's because you pee everywhere like a dog. - Hey, do you like soft scramble? - I don't like the texture. Fried eggs? - If I make some will you try them? Alright how about i do some scrambled and then I'll do you a fried egg as well and then if you don't like the scramble. - Okay. - You got that too, alright? - Okay. - Okay? - Okay. - Go on toast. - What? - Go on toast. - Go on toast? - Yeah. - It's on, it's working.

On that main remote. - Well how come it's still like snow? - Thank you. What? - It's still snow. - That's 'cause the cable's not going on, so you have to, you have to switch it to the cable at the top, okay? - Martin, do you have a sister? - Um no. - We'd like to say a little grace. - I saw a picture. - If you'd like. - No. - Gabi. - Sure. - We thank you god, for this food we are about to eat, and for the company of friends and for all of the blessings you bestow upon us every day, thank you god. - Where's Bethany? - No, this is gabi, mom. Gabriela. - Bethany and Martin divorced several years ago. This Martin's new girlfriend. She's from Spain. Barcelona. Have your special bread. With the seeds in the crust. - Yeah, I know. I like those seeds in the crust. - How long were you married? - Eight months. I don't wanna talk about it please. Silent treatment the whole way home and now you're gonna dig up this shit. - Your mom said where is Bethany. I think I should know something about that. - She made a mistake, okay. Her brain's deteriorating, she can't figure a lot of stuff out you just have to get past it. - Yeah, but that's the other thing, I know that, I know that, because your dad has talked to me about that today. You have not said that to me about your mom. You have not said that you have a sister. - I don't, so. - Just talk to me. Do you have a sister? - No, gabi, I don't have a sister, she's dead. - She's dead? - Yeah, please, stop. - I'm sorry. - It's fine, but you keep digging. - I'm not digging. Don't say that, I'm asking. Because I should know because I'm your girlfriend, right? I mean. Girlfriends know that kind of stuff. You wanna talk about it? You can talk about it with me. - Fine, I'll talk about it. Okay, look. My sister died in a car accident when she was 16. The money from the settlement paid for me to go to college, it completely destroyed my family, and it's never been the same since then. Is that better? - Yeah, it's better because I know. But I don't want you to say it's better like an asshole. - Okay so now I talk to you. - Because I'm finding it out. - I talk to you and I'm the asshole still. - I mean, Martin you're talking to me about-- - I try to tell you something that's personal to me-- - because I find out. - And you call me an asshole? Yeah great, perfect, yeah thanks. - I'm just saying that I'm right now talking about that with you because I'm finding out not because you're talking about it. I just want you to tell me about everything. I'm not digging! - I want all of this with you but I don't fucking need to talk about everything from my past, okay? - But I'm here for that too, I'm not here just for fun and for now. - I know you're not here for fun! - And for parties. I wanna know everything about you. I wanna know your mom is sick and I wanna know you have a sister that is dead and I wanna know that you have an ex wife that is so important in your fucking family. I wanna know everything of this. Because I think I should know! - Gabi, please! You're not talking to me about that. - I tried to talk to you but then-- - you're not talking to me about that! - It's not fucking good enough for you. - Just talk to me! - Everything I do is not good enough. Gabi I don't wanna fucking talk about it. - Why not! - Because there's shit-- - why not! - There's shit you don't wanna talk about. - I wanna talk about everything with you! - No, let's talk about the shit you don't wanna talk about. Let's talk about all the guys you fucked the night we met. - Fucking asshole. You're a fucking asshole. - The very definition of humanity is changing as we know it. And that's only happened like three times ever. - Right. - First. There was a gradual transition from hunter gatherer to agriculture. - Yeah. - Then, this part's gonna blow your mind, there was the flushable toilet, which, I already fucked up, sorry dude. - No, it's okay. - Ignore my penmanship, and that is my favorite part, and that's what is robbing us of our understanding of what it means to be human. It is literally destroying our emotional spectrum. There's only like or shame, pleasure or pain, all extremes no gray, which is funny, because it was our grayness that made us human all along. What do you think? - It's good, I like the emotional spectrum and that being the grayness, it's cool, as long as it doesn't get cheesy at the end. In the wrong hands it could get a little. How's Quinn? - She's good, she's great. Can't believe it, man. - What? - 10 years, that's fucking crazy. - 10 years. - I know next Tuesday. - Jeez. - How's gabi? - She's good. - Good. Do you love her? - I think so. I think I love her, yeah. - Strong enough, because you're so strong, maybe we have to do something. Hey. - Oh hey. - How are you? - Good. I have a consultation appointment with Tim. - With Tim? - You're not Tim. - No no, he's gonna be here, hi, I'm hiding myself. - I'll go over here. I know you right? - What? - Wait. - Oh yeah. - From covelle. - Yeah. - Yeah yeah. - You're there every night. - You eat there with your girlfriends. Yeah, well I manage the place. - Oh really? - So I'm there every night. - Oh my god I love that place. Tim is coming in a minute, if you wanna sit down. - Okay. - Yeah. - I'll wait, yeah. - Sure. Okay let's move your leg now. - Fuck yes, out like a light. - Yeah? - Yup. - You still not on Facebook? - Still not on Facebook. - Bethany might have blocked me. - Maybe she's not on Facebook. - She was. - Maybe she's off. You can delete an account, right? - Yeah, but. - Probably deleted it. - I don't think you can delete it for good, it's still there somewhere. - That's what creeps me out about the Internet, it's like everything is always still there. - Has Quinn seen her? - No. Last I heard she moved to Santa Monica to like do music licensing or something. Fuck. - Could sit here all day. - Hey. - Hi gabi. - Hi, how was that? - It was good. - Yeah? - It was really good yeah. - Yeah, he's the best. - He worked me good. I was thinking about when when I was getting my therapy, there's this amazing party tonight with this chef Charlie Dominic, have you heard of him? - Yeah, you know him? - Yeah we're close, let's just say we're close, but he's having this private dinner tonight. Would you wanna come with me? - No, I have some stuff to do, sorry. - No, no no no. No no no, I won't take no for an answer. I can't, I've done all this. I feel like I almost even came here to see you, even though i didn't know you were here but. I just think about that, and make my night. Bye. - Bye. - Oh my god. My baby. - Oh my god I missed you. I missed you. - I missed you so much. I'm so bored here. - Hey, how are ya? - Hey, good yeah, how are you? - Yeah good good, how come you're back? - Just down for the weekend. - Right. - No but for real, tonight we are going to some salsa at los globos at eight P.M. So you buddy, you're coming with us, okay? - I'll try. I'll do my best. - Well, I mean you missed my going away party. - I did. - So I just wanna put it out there that you do owe me a drink. - How is Claire treating you? - Hey. I thought you had an early appointment. - I just washed those. - I didn't know. Want a tea or coffee or anything? What's wrong? Baby. Hey. Why're you upset? What's going on? What's up? You okay? - I think we have a problem. - Why what's up? - I cheated on you last night, I'm sorry. Martin. Do you wanna tell me something? Do you want to tell me something? What? - I did the same. I'm sorry. - Do you still love me? - Yeah. - I never felt like this for anyone before. - We can make this work. We can figure it out. Please? - Yeah. We can fix it. - Yeah. - It was something freeing about, i thought fuck it, you only live once. - Because it was new, and it was exciting. - What would happen if you, if you shared your feelings? If you told gabi what you told me? - I don't think i could tell her that. - He will think I'm a monster. - She'd think I was a different person, that I wasn't who she loves. - What if you found out that she related? To you, what if you found out that the two of you had a lot more in common? You might be surprised. - Maybe love is not enough. Maybe we're not in love. I am in love, I am in love, I know that, but maybe it's not enough. - I wanna give you guys a challenge. When you go home I want you to sit down and try to be 100% honest with each other about anything, just for an hour. And it can be small. In fact it should be to start. It's gonna take some time and a little bit of courage. It takes courage to me in love. - Okay. - Alright. - You say something honest and then you take a sip. You cannot drink if you are not saying something honest first. - Okay. - Okay. With how many people did you sleep? - That'll be around, I mean I don't keep count, but it's gonna be high 20s-ish. - How old were you when you lost your virginity? - I was 16 I was thinking that he was so so sexy and I was excited and we had sex a few times and then he stopped talking to me after it, so I went back to Barcelona and then next summer i came back here and then I saw this guy again and he wanted to have sex with me again but then I, I fucked his friend instead. - Why, what? - I don't know. I don't know, I was 16, so. - When I was nine I would, I can't believe I'm telling you this, I would watch my sister in the shower. - Why do you feel bad about that? - 'Cause I can't believe you were just cool about that, I was like. - I mean kids do that, they're curious. I could just be there watching with you, for sure. It's really okay. - What is it? It's always there you're grabbing. - I don't know, there's something I like here. It's like , I touch it and i feel like. - I have another one. - Okay tell me. - I want you really really bad right now. Come on, let's go to bed. - No, let's stay here. - Gabi. - What? - People will see us. - So what? - So I don't. - So what? Fuck them. We can do it like this. - Say hi to him. - Who was that? - The guy I slept with that night. - Do you want other people? - Sometimes I miss flirting with other people. Do you? - Part of me does, yeah. - Which part of you doesn't? - The part that's afraid I'll lose you. - If you're honest with me, you will never lose me. Just have to be honest. - Yeah, let's be honest. - No secrets, no family secrets, no sex secrets, okay? - Yeah. - If you wanna flirt with a girl, you can do it, just tell me. - Okay. - You sure? - Yeah. - Who's party did Blake say it was? - What? - Who's party did Blake say it was? - I don't know. A friend? - It's gonna be fancy. Is Blake already here? - Yeah, I guess so, let's look for her. - Oh boy. Where's the bar? I need a drink. - There. So choose one. - Let me pick, let me pick, you're distracting me. I'm going with. Okay there's a girl inside, by like the fire place in front of, see her in the red dress? - Yeah. You like this girl? - Yeah. She's hot right? - She's hot. - I got you, you can pick one. - I might pick the same girl. - The same girl? Okay. - Everyone! - Want me to pick a guy? - Birthday boy will be here in about 20 minutes. No ins or outs, we wanna make sure we surprise him, okay? - It's a birthday party? - It's a birthday party. - Hey. - What? - Why don't you go and flirt with the tall girl? - The girl inside? - Yeah. - And I'm gonna be watching you. - Yeah, you're gonna watch? - Yeah, I want you to flirt like for real. - Okay. - Hey, hi. - Hi. - How's is going? - Good. - Sorry if I'm interrupting.

No bullshit. - Exactly. - Are they also using it for best friends, have you heard about that? - You can find best friends? - Yes. On bum, what is man? Bumble? - It seems a weird way to start a friendship. - No but why not? - Between guys. - I mean you can have sex. - I'm here with my girlfriend, we kinda noticed someone when we came and we were kinda talking about you outside and then she kinda, she told me to come over and have a chat. - You came over here because your girlfriend. - Yes, yes, that's correct. - Okay, cool. - What? - Hey could you excuse me for a second? - Yeah of course. - You're very hidden away here. - Blake. Yeah I'm hiding. - From? - From everyone at the moment. I'm not blending in. - You don't like my party? - No it's great, thank you very much. No no, that's not what I meant. - No, where's gabi? - I have no idea, i lost her, she was. - Hiding like usual. - Yeah. - Anyway. I mean it's not a bad place to hide. - No it's good. - Do you have a lighter? - Yeah. - Thank you. - Good dress. - Thank you. - Surprise! - Wow, okay. Well thank you, enjoy the party! Can I have a single cup of ice? Do you have any coffee? - No, sorry, sir. - Happy birthday. - Oh thank you. - I'm gabi. - Larry. - Nice to meet you. - Good to meet you. And you came with? - With Blake. - Oh, Blake! My paralegal, she's great. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Were you surprised? - I wan surprised, yes. I don't wanna seem ungrateful, but I just came off a 16 hour flight, I'd love to be in bed. - You're like, grumpy. - Would you like some coffee? - Let's go and take a coffee. - If I was in mild peril, and you turned up, I'd be thrilled. I'd be so happy with that. Like, perfect, save the day. I would be getting into trouble purposefully. 'Cause you're like. - Do I look like a superhero? - You have the presence of a superhero. - The presence of a-- - I just meant the composure. The composure and, not like the presence. - The physique? - The physique as well, yeah you're tall, you could be a superhero. - I invent games. I go into art gallery or museums. - Yeah? - And then that's a play I do with my boyfriend, we have to choose one piece of art and we have to take it home. - I thought you came with Blake. - Yeah, I came with her. I mean, she invited us. - Okay so, what would you take? What would you take from the kitchen? - From this kitchen? - Yeah. - The toaster. - Good choice. - Sorry. - You go. - Excuse us. Sorry, sorry, sorry. - Hey! Hey, what're you leaving? - Yeah we're leaving. - Well thanks for helping me wake up. - No, thanks for the party it was so good. - Yeah, thanks man. - See you around. - Bye. - Bye. - See ya later. - Did you like watching me? - Yeah. - Really? - Yeah, did you want him? - I want you. - What do you want? - I want to watch you get a lap dance from a stripper. What do you want? - I wanna spy on you. - How? - I wanna watch you on a date. - Okay, this one. - Yeah. - Yeah? He's handsome. - What do you wanna do? - What're we going to do now? - Take him to ours. - And then he put on a condom, and he took me from behind. - Where? - Against the wall. - Did you cum? - No. - What else do you want? - I want a threesome. - With who? - You can choose. - How about Blake? - No friends. It's complicated, friends. - Yeah okay, no friends. - Open relationship. - Open relationship. - And yes, this one? - Yes. No. No. No. Yes. Fuck yes. - What time is it? Like 10:30. Is she breathing? I'm being serious. She hasn't moved for like five minutes. Oh, she's awake! - Repeat after me, I promise to always push you. - I promise to always push you. - I promise to keep sending you in new directions. - I'll keep sending you in directions. - And never stop. - And never stop. - And to do it together. - And to do it together. - So the sacred cow of the romantic ideal is monogamy, and the idea itself that it could be negotiated means already that there's something missing. The conversation about infidelity and the conversation about open relationships is not the same one. Because the essence of infidelity is secrets. It's organized around a secret. The concept of an open relationship is that your explorations with others are not secret and that notion that when I go to look for someone else, it's not always because i wanna get away from you, it's because I wanna get away from the person that I have myself become. And it's not that I want to find somebody else, but I want to find another self. I think it's at the core of a lot of affairs. There are people who are trying to basically reconcile two sets of values, two fundamental sets of human needs. Is to have one relationship in which with you i can have the anchor and the waves. I can have the stability and the security, but I can also have the freedom and the autonomy. And this improbable marriage, between the feeling of belonging and the feeling of freedom with one person is probably the great challenge of modern love today. - You wanna ask it. - I don't know. - What's you're name? - She can't answer all of our questions. - Enjoy. Thank you. - Hi, thank you so much, gabi. - Hi gabi. - Martin. - I'm Martin. Very nice to meet you. - Hey Martin. - How's it going? - Good, good. - Thank you so much, it was amazing. We are trying to do this kind of open relationship and just to listen to someone recommending it it makes you feel like, okay, it's okay. - So we are clear, I'm not recommending it, but that doesn't mean it's not valued. So if you think of it as, the thing that doesn't kill us but makes us stronger, then yes, but I really want you to imagine it less as a destination and more as a layover. - Gabi. Say hey for me. - He says hi. He's always so excited when he says, oh say Martin, hi hi, kiss. - How is he? Do you think they'll come out and visit? - No I was talking about, maybe coming on Christmas but they're like, they don't know yet. - That'd be fun. - Yeah. - I'd like that. - Excuse me, miss, can I help you? - Actually you can, because I'm like quite lost. - Welcome. - Did you see that one? - That was magic. - Must've been three yards. - It's magical. - If half of what you told me is true, you gotta marry her asap. I'm serious, lock that chick down, man. - It's good, we don't own each other, but, it's made us a lot closer, you know. - And you're genuinely okay if she sleeps with other people, it doesn't freak you out? - So far like no, no one's made her cum, so it's kinda like, makes me feel great. When she comes home I'm the one that gets her off, so. - It's amazing. - It's weird, I don't know. - I'm very jealous. Ah shit. You know what I did last night? - What? - I read Peter petere pumpkin eater, I changed a shitty diaper and I fell asleep at eight P.M. in a chair. There's something i gotta tell you man and there's like no cool way to do it, so, I don't know how to say it so I'm just gonna, Bethany had a kid. After you brought her up the other day, I asked Quinn and Quinn went on Facebook. I guess she had a little boy earlier this year with some guy. I think he's an ex boyfriend. He's not in the picture but, it's all Facebook info, so I don't really know what time, I just, I knew that, I knew that I should tell you. - I guess she did block me. - You married? Twice? - Divorced. - Do you have kids? - So does your boyfriend know that you're here? - Not yet, but I'll tell him. - What're you guys like, swingers or something? - We're like open. We tell each other everything. - How does that work? - It works good. It's just being honest. - What do you get out of that? - What do you mean? Like I have to get something out of it? - Well everything's a transaction. - Okay. Transparency. - Worst off. - Why? - Well, in my experience, there's some things that you just can't see and maybe that's for the best. - What's the goal then? - The goal? The goal is accepting that I'm alone. I spent so many years of my life trying to structure it so i wouldn't feel alone but, finally you can't own anything. Not really. So now I like to look out at the ocean and if somebody kind, smart and attractive was to spend some time looking out with me, well then that works too. So you acclimate. - I don't know, i think it's still sad somehow. - Saddest people are the ones who don't know what they want. - Hey. - Hi. What're you doing? - Just hanging out. You have a good day? - Yeah, I'm so tired. - Yeah. How was it? - It was good. He's cool. You know, he has no bullshit. It was fun. The sunset was amazing. - Were you guys safe? - What? - Were you safe? - No no no, we didn't do anything. - What did you do? - We talk and we got some drinks, spent some time on the boat, that's it. - Come on. - What're you doing there? - What? - What are you doing here? You okay? - Yeah yeah, I'm good, heading out. - You sure? - Yeah. - Where? - To see Paul. Call if you need anything, alright? - Okay. - See you later. - Okay bye. - Bye. - Oh, hello. What's up? - Hi. - How are you? - I'm good, how are you? - Good to see you, Martin, Claire, Martin, Claire. Claire is gabi's roommate. - Oh cool hi. - Know what's keeping you guys all day. - Oh hey. - What's up, what're you doing tonight? Just drinking? - Yeah, hanging out. - Your friends coming, you just bye yourself? - No I'm alone. - You said that so sad. - No no. I was having a night drink. - You need a friend? - Yeah yeah, if you wanna join. - Do you wanna sit? - No I'm meeting up with the girls. Text me later. - Okay. - Bye. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. See you later. - What're you drinking? And how drunk are you already? - I'm not that drunk, that's juice. - You know, gabi and i aren't actually that close. We're only friends because of Claire. Well not only friends because of Claire, but. - Really. - And the guys are really into gabi. It's kind of infuriating. - It's infuriating, really? - Yeah, extremely. - Because you have such trouble with the guys, really? - I'm selective. I'm picky. - Selective, okay. What're you picky about? - Tall, funny, sensitive. - Alright. - We should take shots. - Shots? - That was very out of the blue, but yes, we should. - Okay, alright. - Can we please do shots? - Should we wait just a minute or something? - No. Do I have to open your mouth and pour it down? Yes! I sound like a valley girl. Good idea. What's up? - What? - You just like do this thing where you go off and then you come back. It's kinda rude. - I'm right here. - Come on tell me, what's wrong? - Nothing is wrong. - I see something above your head and it kinda looks like a big black cloud. - No no, nice try though. - Come on. Tell me what's up, don't be a pussy. - Don't be a pussy? Really you think that's-- - man up. The dark cloud is getting bigger. It's taking over the whole bar. - No. No. - You need another shot? - My ex wife had this, she had a miscarriage. A few years ago. - I'm sorry. - No, you don't have to be sorry, I'm not saying it for sympathy, I'm just saying that, this thing, we talked about having kids and obviously she was distraught when it happened, of course, and then she asked me how I was doing, and I realized I was kind of relieved. I lost it. I ran from everything. I ran from her. And school and everything, but that's. I just drove myself crazy with all the bad stuff I could be. It was so simple, like now in the back, it was so simple. I just couldn't tell her a simple truth. I wasn't ready. I wasn't ready for any of that. Any of it. I couldn't say that to her so. The thing is I always believed that she when I was ready she would be waiting for me, of course, she was the one who's gonna love me most always. And then like, this morning I found out she had a kid, and I don't even, that's great. It's great. - I did not mean to put you in this situation, I'm sorry. - It's fine. Do you wanna get another shot, or? - I'm okay. I'm sorry. It's just that, I don't think I'm the right person to tell. I'm gonna go. See you soon. Bye. - Hey gabi. Gabi, hey. Babe, are you awake? Hey. Hey. Can we talk real fast? - Hi. I'm sleeping. - I know, but i need to talk to you. - In the morning. - No, baby, please now. - Come, come in here. - I know, but can we talk first? Please? - Come. I want to spoon you. Hi, how are you? - Hi. - What's you're name? - Angelica. - My name is gabi, nice to meet you. - Yes, well we actually frequent this place quite often. - Really? - There's a particular fish that we like to see. - You have to show me the best places. - This one guy, he's like a sort of dragon of sorts, isn't he? Well here's my favorite guy. - They look like spots, like these different little spots. - Ah shit! Oh you're in fucking trouble now. Oh you're in so much trouble. Man down! No no no! - Do you like my part? - Yeah. This is a baby diary, day one. - There is a baby. - Yeah. It's that big already. - I'm gonna be like that pretty soon. - I'm gonna love you. I'm gonna love you so much. I felt it, it kicked. - Really? - It kicked. Oh yeah, it's gonna be a little fighter. - What a little lush. Drunk on pizza and milkshake. There's some wine if you want. I'll get some rioja. - Okay. - And some cabernet, you chose one if you like. - Okay. - And the decanter. - Don't worry, okay. Is she asleep? Wow, oh. - G. - G, yes. Gina? - Gina, yes, every girlfriend i have begins with a g. - Greta? - Greta. - It's very nice, I mean you don't have to give me anything. - I'm sorry, I didn't mean to. - No no, I'm not upset. I like it a lot, thank you so much. - I like you. - And I like you. - Hey. - Hey. What're you doing home? - I called in here today. - Oh, are you sick? - No, just needed it. - We can spend the morning together. Yeah? - Yeah. You gonna tell me what happened? - Yesterday? - Mm-hm. - Nothing, we went to the aquarium with his daughter, she's super sweet. She's so cute, she's amazing. And then we went to his place and then we opened some wine and we got a little bit drunk. - And that was it? - No, we had sex. - Did you cum? - Yeah. You okay? Sure? - Fuck. When are you gonna see him again? Alright. - I'm having a a dinner at my house a weekend after the next, I was wondering if you were around, you might wanna come. - Yeah. - Yeah? - Maybe yeah. I have to check with Martin. I don't know if we are gonna do something. Okay, maybe I come. - Does, does he wear protection? - Martin? No. - I'd like it if he did, you know. - Martin is my boyfriend. - And what am I? - You're my boat man. - Your boat man. - Oh shit. - Oh no, not another cramp. - Yeah. That's it, that's it. - Cold feet. - Yeah, cold feet. - Warm heart. - She, she told me about all of his ex wife drama, I didn't even know he had an ex wife so. - What drama? He has an ex wife, so what? - She implied that there were maybe regrets and issues. It just seemed like there was a lot of baggage. - That he had issues with his ex wife? - What do you think? Is there any issues between you guys? - No of course not, but why is he talking about to Blake? - I don't know. - Why is Blake talking about that to you? - I think you need to ask him. You okay? - Yeah. - Wanna watch a movie or something? - What? - Wanna watch a movie? - No, you go, you go, you watch it. You are constantly on my mind, anything I think or do is just a reflection of our time together and that makes me miss you constantly. - What the fuck are you doing? Hey. - I think of-- - you can't go through my fucking shit. - Why did you message her? What is going on? Why are you missing her? Because you care, all the time. - My fucking personal shit. You shouldn't go through it. - It's your shit? - Yes. - It's your fucking shit? You have to talk to me about your fucking shit, okay? - I don't need to talk to you about it? It's my fucking business! - Why are you not open about her? - I tried. I tried to fucking talk to you. - When you try? When you try? When? When? - Gabi please. Don't fucking start this, you fucking can't go through that shit. - No tell me, when you try? - No no. - You are not talk to me about that. - You know what we need to fucking talk about? Let's talk about this. - Okay, I didn't know how to react to that. - You didn't know how to react to this, but you didn't have a problem fucking accepting it, did you? You didn't have a problem fucking keeping it, did you? Is this from him, huh? You can tell me about it, gabi, you can tell me all about this, because that's how we work. That's how this works, that's how we work, please. Tell me about this fucking necklace you got given, please. Because I don't fucking know about that. - It's just a fucking necklace. - Do you love him? - No! No, do you love her? - No, I don't fucking love her, she's in the past. - She's a fucking ghost! She's a fucking ghost inside of you. - She's not a fucking ghost. - She's fucking here. - She's not a ghost - she's fucking here. - She's in the past, gabi! She's not, she's here! - Get the fuck off me. Do you think i wanted any of this? Do you think I want any of this? Knowing you're with another guy half the time? You're with another fucking guy because you're so fucking self entitled, you knew I loved you, so you fucking drag me along for your fucking games. I didn't want any of this! - You didn't? - No! - You fucking most-- - entitled. - Self deceptive person I've ever met. - Yeah and you're the most self destructive, so i guess we're even right? Fuck. I don't know. I guess she went home. Or, she might've moved in with him. - I'm sorry, man. You know my grandparents were together for 57 years. The night that i proposed to Quinn, I called them up, my grandpa, and I asked him what the, what the secret was and he kinda thought about it for a real long time actually and then he said, love is two people who don't give up on each other. Simple as that. - You're saying it's a choice? - I feel like if you think too hard about it, you're just kinda complicating it and fucking it up. You gotta stop thinking. And you gotta get your broke ass phone fixed. Or get a fax machine or something. Get a beeper. - I would love a beeper. I think that's more my vibe, you know. - You'd look good with one, it'd complete your look, man. - Fuck. I don't know, whatever will be will be. - No man. No, see, for love to work and for happiness to work and for you to wanna have a family some day, you have to actually pursue it. You know, don't leave it up to fate. - Hey. - Morning. - Oh my god, you're a early bird, right? Is your daddy up? - No, not yet. - Not yet? Do you wanna start breakfast for him? - Yeah! - Yeah? You help me? Oh my god. He's coming. You can't look yet. - Oh my god, what's going on? - You cannot come yet. Stop him. Stop him. - No no! - I won't look, I won't look. - Stop him. - Did you, did you have any dreams last night? - Yeah. I was in another dimension and it was 2040. - Wow. - And then I was like. And then I saw my future self. - Wow. - Yeah, and I was like who are you? And then my future self was like, who are you? Can I play on my iPad? - Yeah, sure you can. Don't get the iPad sticky with all the maple syrup. Can you wash your hands first? Yeah? - Okay. - Okay. See you later. - Bye. - Bye. I've been meaning to tell you that I have this offer that would take me to Europe for a while. - Really? - Yeah. - For work? - Munich, Milan, and Barcelona. - That's good. Barcelona's good. How long? - A year, two years. Depending on how things go. - A year or two? That's a long time. What're you gonna do with Angie? - Angie's gonna come. - Really? Yeah? - Managed to convince her mother that it would be a mistake not to allow her this kind of opportunity. Her brain is like a little sponge right now. - Yeah. Yeah. No, it's so good for kids to travel. They learn other languages and cultures. - Yeah. - She's lucky to have you. - I'd like you to come. You could spend time with your family, your friends. We can make new ones together. - Yeah. It's like, I don't know, because I have my job here, my friends, I have like this whole life down here. - We could have a life there. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. When is this happening? - Two weeks. These are the best soft scrambled eggs I've ever had. What did you do to them? - It's like the details. - All the details. - Yeah. - I gotta make a call. - Okay. - Okay. - That's why i don't think they're right. - Okay. Excuse me, I'll be one second. Pharmacy. - Martin? - Hey. - Hey, sorry, I didn't know you were at work. - Yeah, no no, it's good. How are you? - I got your email, I thought about emailing back but, I thought it'd be better if we spoke. I asked Quinn for this number. - Always flip your car over. - Daddy. - Oh hi, honey. - The TV isn't playing. - Gabi, can you? - Yeah, sure. - Thank you so much. It was the other time when he was in New York and he followed all the steps. - Hey. What's going on with the TV? - I tried but, all it did was go red. - Okay, let's see. - That's all it did. - What about? - That's what i was talking about! That's what I was talking about. - Okay. - This is Blake. - Blake, nice to meet you. - Does a lot of great legal work for us. - Blake, nice to meet you. - Yeah, it's great to have Blake here. Would you like a glass of wine? - Yeah. - Cocktail? - Wine's great. - Hey! Hey hey hey hey. Hey, where're you going? - Why is she here? - She works with me, I thought you guys were friends. - I want her out. - Come on, don't be silly, she is here. - No I want her out right now. - No. - I just want her to leave right now, I'm right here with this. - I'm not kicking her out. Now stop being like a fucking teenager, okay, you're embarrassing yourself and me. - Okay. - Me and Martin we only talked, we just talked okay? You should know that, you should know that. I don't care what you're doing with Larry. Talk to me for a second. - Thank you. It's good to see you, Martin. - Yeah, you too. Congratulations again, on the baby. - Oh yeah. Yeah, it was a surprise, definitely. But it was the best thing that's ever happened to me. - Yeah? - I know that sounds cliche but, but it's true. - No, it's not, it's not cliche, I mean if it wasn't. What's his name? - Dylan. Yeah, I know. - It's a good name. Like Bob. - I wanted to see you in person to tell you I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Martin. - You don't have to say that, you have nothing to be sorry about. I'm the one, I should apologize. - For blaming you. That was unfair of me. It wasn't your fault or mine. We were just kids playing house. - Are you happy? - I am. But you know what the funny thing is, it's not very exciting. It's kinda boring, predictable. I don't know, maybe that's just adulthood. Are you happy? Are you happy? You're seeing someone. You have a girlfriend? - No. Can I see Dylan? Do you have any photos? - Yeah, sure. - Oh my god. He is-- - he's very alert. Always amazed looking and he was fat, like obese. - Oh no. Oh my god. - Look at his arms. - He was chunky, right. - He's my heart. - He's so cute. I'm really, really happy for you, that's. - Yeah. You should go back to work. - Thank you for making time to stop by. It's good to see you. - Thank you for the water. - It's la's finest. - You consider my offer? You know I'm leaving soon, it's be nice to know. - You don't think we have to talk first? - About what? - About yesterday, last night? - Well, the way that I see it, I invited some friends, you felt out of place, then Blake arrived and for some reason you went a little crazy and, I'm fine with that but, beyond that I'm really not all that interested, no I'm not in all honesty. - You don't wanna know what i was doing last night? - We can run around in circles here. Help me help you, what is it you need? - Why you don't take me seriously? - Seriously? - Yeah. - This entire relationship was based upon me not taking you seriously. It's how you introduced yourself. It's what you are. By your actions, it's what your proving to be. I'm fine with that, okay? Do you wanna know how an adult relationship works? Do you want me to be transparent? This is a transaction. I give you a necklace, you look at the ocean with me. I give you a place to stay, you play Patty cakes with my daughter and you sleep in my bed. We go to Europe and you spend time with your friends, your family and we live like fucking royalty. And you spare me whatever perverted bullshit you have to do in order to feel somehow whole. You want transparency? You got transparency, okay? I'm sorry, that was harsh. - That's okay. I get what you want, but I think you are wrong about me. I think you don't care to know me and you don't know me at all. - Okay let's talk. - No. No, I mean. We say sometimes things we don't mean actually, but I think you don't care to know me at all, to know if you mean it or not. It's easy or nothing with you, right? It's okay. You have your whole life all set, right? It's done. I have not even started mine and I don't know, I don't know how I'm gonna do it, but I'm gonna start mine. And I don't wanna do it with you. I think I want something of my own now. I want something serious. I thought I didn't want it, but I do want it. I don't know if I deserve it, but I want to try it, and I think that if I try it hard, maybe I find a way with you. Because when we're together, it was magic. You say something. - It just can't be how it was. - I know, I know. - You do? - Yeah. If I say it, I know, I do know. I don't want it like before, i don't want it like before. - You know when i said I was in before, I wasn't, not all of me. I was afraid but. I really want you, only you. - I want you. I think we're, we're going to get bored of each other. - That's okay. You know, bored is okay. - We're going to resent each other, too. - We'll remind each other why we're worth it. - I will disappoint you. - I will disappoint you. - You promise? - Yes. - You promise me. - I promise you.
