It's that bitch of his that's the problem. I got 50 men in the street. If they all get bitch troubles, I starve, is that it? Priest, do what you wanna do. I want his ass out working. Say, priest, you know me, man. You'll get your money. This ain't the first time. I've had to wait as long as a month for my money. You're trying to take advantage of me. This time, you're going to work. All I do is sell coke. I don't do no violence. Don't argue with me, man! I'm tryin' to give you a chance. You don't get me my money tonight, I'll put your girl on whore's row. Listen, priest, that's my wife. So what! Now, somebody's going to work tonight, Freddie. You really shouldn't have fucked with my money, Freddie. You'll get your money, man. You know that thing we talked about in New Jersey? You take him on it. Anything happens, the gun's not marked, dump it. We'll make it, priest. I don't deal with no guns or no violence. You don't listen, man. You meet me at Scatter's tonight. Speak up. It's priest. That's cool. Come on, baby! Throw that 6! What you mean, I ain't got 6, baby? These ladies do what I want. I'm the dude they're workin' for. All right, comin' out. Here we go. 6, the winner! Give me the money. Pay the man out there. Pay him out. You seen the dice. Now let me see your money. Look like rent money! Ha ha ha! It'll be your mother's rent money before we're through. You want to double up on that, my man? Bet 500. Bet 500 right here. Money in the bank. Give me the dice. Come on, house, damn. Give me a pair of dice, will ya? Here we go. Dice comin' out. Comin' out, new point. There you go. All right. Here we go. Comin' out. Point. Come on. Shoot the dice. Hey, what's the matter? Everything's cool. You wouldn't be comin' down here unless you wanted to talk to me. Don't feed the dice. Roll 'em. What you gonna do? How long you gonna be? Don't pull me out now. This nigger's got a fistful of money, and he's letting me double up. That's what I come down here for. Hey, come on. Take that number out. Here we go. Comin' out. Comin' out. 6-- Hey, priest. Wait a minute. I gotta talk to my man. I'll give you a chance to get your money later on. What's this shit, man? Dude taps you on the shoulder, my money walks out the door. Take that shit outside. Fuck that shit, man. What so important he's gotta leave now? I lost a lot of money. We got business. What business? Answer me, you white-lookin'-- take it easy, baby. Take it easy. Just relax... Thatta' boy. Get your game goin', house. Come on. We're here to gamble, now. Gimme a shooter. We got anything to eat, man? I don't know, man. You know, I had to put Freddie out to work. You don't mean Fat Freddie. Ha ha! You didn't, man. Hey, you're gonna give that hard-luck nigger a heart attack. O.K. What's wrong with you, nigger? You think this is funny? Dragged me out of the crap game to pull me up here. What is it, man? I'm gettin' out, Eddie. Gettin' out of what? The cocaine business. Oh, sweet Jesus, man. Those junkies must've knocked a hole in your head. You're gonna give all this up? 8-track stereo, color TV in every room, and can snort a half-piece of dope every day. That's the American dream, nigger. Well, ain't it? Ain't it? You better come on in, man. How much money we got, Eddie? About 300,000. That's 150 each. That's about enough to keep your nose open for about a year. Look, I know it's a rotten game. It's the only one the man left us to play. And that's the stone cold truth. Look, I'm going to run a number. I'm gettin' out with a half-million. You are, man? And what about me? You're my partner, ain't you? What I get, you get. Now, let me get this straight. You talkin' about $1 million cash. Right. In just four months. Look, we're gonna take that 300,000, and we're gonna buy 30 keys of coke, man. The best shit in town. Rocks and lumps as big as marbles. No cut. With the family we got now, we can deal 30 keys in 4 months. And then we're off the street forever with a million in cash. The big 1. How long this been in your head? You don't do nothin' overnight. I am your partner. You could've told me. I didn't want you shootin' at it, Eddie. I didn't need anybody puttin' any doubts in my mind. Anyway, I'm tellin' you now. Man, you fuckin' out of your mind. Where you gonna get 30 keys at that price? From Scatter. You crazy. Scatter said after that last deal he wasn't gonna deal no more coke. He'll do it for me. He'll do it one more time. Are you crazy? Oh, bullshit. Look, Eddie, this is a chance, and I wanna take it. Now. Before I have to kill somebody. Before somebody ices me. Are you with me, Eddie? You got it. Solid. There he is, the little fat cat who just came out. Oh, come on, man. This is crazy. Shut up. Just shut up, will you? If I blow this thing, we'll both get in trouble. Let me have the money so I can play this cat. Just shut up. And take this goddamn gun. Freeze! Come with me. Get over here! Keep your hands up. Keep 'em up. Get up against that. You know what this is. All right, give me that money. You know what you're doing? Give me the money and stop talking. What money? In your pocket. Give it up! Give me the money before I kill you. Ain't got no money. Give me the money. I don't want to rap. Give me the other one. Don't you move a inch. Get your hands up. Keep facing that wall. If you look around, I'll blow your head off.

Now, that's what I need. Ohh. That's cool. You white around the nose as a Georgia mule. Ain't he? What you come to see Scatter about? I got something real heavy to lay on you, man. Lookee here. I want to buy 30 keys of coke. Me and Eddie have put together 300,000 in cash. What'd you come to me for? I ain't dealing, and you know that, nigger. No, man, dig it. See, me and Eddie have put together a family you wouldn't believe. We're prepared to deal 30 keys in four months, man. Only four months, and I'm off the street for the rest of my life with a million in cash. Not through me. Those last 15 keys I laid on you was all I had left. I gave you one scholarship, young blood. I call myself givin' you a break. Nobody ever gave me nothin'. I told you that was all I'd front. Look, don't do this to me, man. Now, look... Don't call ass on me, man. I can't get the price or the quality anywhere else. Why come to me with all this shit after all I've done for you? I done told you I'm getting out of this business. I thought you'd do it for me, man. I've been washing your wheel. I've run errands for you ever since I was a kid. You were always the man. Who the hell else could I go to? You were always my man. Scatter-- my main man. What do you mean, nigger? That cocaine I laid on you you used to get that 300,000, huh? And I didn't ask you for nothing up front. Got your ass started. Now, this is it. I'm retired. I ain't got no coke left. Your lines is still open. Oh, shit, you can get it, nigger. You want to get it. You know goddamn well-- don't talk that talk to me when you ain't got a gun in your hand. Hey, come on, put the gun down. Please, man. I'll kill this nigger of yours. Scatter, we're just tryin' to get out, man. Please, now, don't kill him. You know what it means-- try and get out--huh? Please, man, I'm sorry. What if your man gets caught? You goin' to take that chance with me? It's all the time I got left. All I got left, young blood. Don't seem right to shoot it all on one door for nothing. I don't need no money. Look... I can do it, man. See, I wouldn't have to go through the shit you went through. I'll still be young. I can get into something else, get my head straight. Do it for me, man, and you can depend on me the rest of your life. Then turn me on to your man. Turn me on, and you won't have to take none of the weight at all. Honky would have me killed. I don't take nobody to him. He picks his own niggers. You got any coke left? Yeah. I got enough to hold me until I can score, but you listen to me. I'm gonna do it. It's gonna take me a lot longer, but I'm definitely gonna do it, man. Well, I got one key of my own. It's my personal. You come around tomorrow night, uh, pick it up. You should always have more on hand than you need. Here, nigger. Maybe I'll do it for you. But this is the last time. You fuck it up, young blood, and you're on your own. ♪♪ I'm so glad I've got my own ♪♪ ♪♪ So glad that I can see ♪♪ ♪♪ My life's a natural high ♪♪ ♪♪ The man can take nothing on me ♪♪ ♪♪ I'm so glad I've got my own ♪♪ ♪♪ So glad that I can see ♪♪ ♪♪ My life's a natural high... ♪♪ After hours place in half an hour.

He's a crazy old man, too. He might have popped a cap on your ass. Not with you standin' there. I hear you talkin'. O.K., man, I'll see you tomorrow. Sweets... Yeah. I want a nice cold beer. You got it. Solid. What's happenin', priest? Mm-hmm. Thanks, man. Where's the fat man? He had to go pick up his wife. Hey, priest. Are you on my case tonight, or what? Looks that way, doesn't it? I was at Scatter's when them ho's went crazy on me, embarrassin' me and things, spilled that shit all over me. I'll be all right. Crazy mothers. I still love 'em, too. See that white thing?

Freddie, you need somethin' extra for yourself? Yeah, I sure do. I'll hold it for you, baby. Hang onto that real tight, will ya? Why don't you go play the jukebox? What do you want to hear? Just play anythin'. Heh heh heh... We didn't want to come down on you, Freddie, but coke costs money, and somebody pays. Yeah, I know. I have no beef, man. Well, that's enough of that shit tonight. I'm celebratin'. What's goin' on anyway, man? Nothin'. Sellin' cocaine, as usual. I have a contact with weight. What are you doin' tomorrow night? I only got a pickup about 1:00. Well, if it's downtown... No. Uptown. Scatter's. Say, man, give me another one of those joints. Only the best for the family. I hear ya. Oh, Freddie, you're so sweet. You didn't have to do that because of me. You made me feel guilty. Guilty? You don't look like you feel guilty. You look like you always look. Hey... Listen... Priest, I know how you feel sometimes when you come in here. I can feel from you what it's like out there. I see what it does to you. I know how dope helps hold your head together. I don't want your privacy, baby. All I want to do is help you share the weight. Please let me in. I just can't be somebody else you gotta deal with. I love you. Oh, fuck you. Oh, priest... Oh...

Two male negroes. Probably a dope dealer. Yeah. Cocaine. He's O.K. We'll bring him in soon as the ambulance gets here. You... You're gettin' better, priest. Let's try it again. O.K. But this is it. I gotta meet Georgia. You sayin' you beat a man half to death because he touched your wife's hand? He shouldn't have done it. It means more than that to me. What about this, Freddie? Aah! If you're smart, we can put you on the street again. I don't want to waste my time on a two-bit piece of shit like you. With your record, I can put you away for 25 years. I don't want you. I want your man. Who do you work for? You know I can't tell ya. Who's your man? Aah! I can't tell ya, man. Come here. Now I'll tell you why I brought you out here today. I made me a deal last night that'll bring in enough money to get us both out of this whole scene. Both of us, baby. Now, this priest... Does he work for somebody? He and his partner work independent. How big is the family? About 50 now... Or better. 50? A year ago they only had 10 or 15. This key you're pickin' up tonight-- what time? 1:00. All right, get him out of here. What should we do with him? Take him downtown and book him. What's the charge? You read the arresting officer's report. I don't deal with shit like this. Get him. Get up! Look, maybe you should get out now before something really bad happens. I could be happy with a plain life. Look, what would I do? With my record, I can't even work civil service or join the damn army. If I quit now, I took all this chance for nothin' and I go back to being nothin', workin' some jive job for chump change, day after day. If that's all I'm supposed to do, they'll have to kill me, 'cause that ain't enough. Come on. Halt! What do you do when you get out? I don't know. It's not so much what we do, it's havin' a choice... Being able to decide what it is I want, not just to be forced into a thing because that's the way it is. I'm gonna buy me some time, baby, some time that isn't all fucked up with things we gotta do. Just to be free. And will that make you happy? I don't know. I don't know. I just know... I can't be happy the way it is now. I never was. All right, freeze! Down the stairs, mother. Hit the wall. Come on. All right, turn around. You just picked up a key of cocaine from Scatter. You work for Scatter? What is this shit? He's askin' the questions. Answer him. I know Scatter hasn't dealt direct for over a year, but he managed to move 15 keys, and he just ordered 30 more. You Scatter's man? Are the 30 keys yours? Yeah. They ours. You don't have to cover for Scatter. He's lookin' to get out anyway, and I'm lookin' for someone to carry his weight. Why didn't you ask Scatter about us? I got my own ways of findin' things out. Besides, when I heard how big you two were, I wanted to meet you myself. I don't go through Scatter. What we talkin' about? We're talkin' about 10,000 a key. You do all right on this, you get an open line plus credit. Any problems? No, man. One of my people will call tomorrow and give you a number. Any police problems or anything I should know, you call that. You deal direct with me. After a few days, you'll see that I'm good, stand-up people. Come on. Ha ha ha... Ohh...ha ha... What's wrong with you? Baby, what's the matter with me? We in! We got the main line. That honky sound like he can even keep the cops off our back. You know they got cats out there like that, baby. We're gonna be bigger than Scatter ever dreamed of bein'. You forgot what we're in this for, Eddie. That was before what happened tonight went down. If we can make a million in four months, imagine what we can make in four years. Now, can you dig that? I went along with that thing of yours about getting out 'cause I had nothin' else. When I get out, what am I gonna do? I don't know nothin' else but dope, baby-- takin' it, sellin' it, bankrollin' some other small-time pusher. You know, you got this fantasy in your head about...gettin' out of the life and settin' that other world on its ear. What the fuck are you gonna do except hustle... Besides pimpin'? And you really ain't got the stomach for that. Now, man, I ain't puttin' you down. If it wasn't for you, I probably wouldn't be here. I'd be OD'd someplace. I'm just tryin' to make it real, baby, like it is. I mean, maybe this is what you're supposed to do. Maybe this is what you've grown to. I mean, just think about it. Man, don't throw it out. Just--just think about it. You know what? I'm thinkin' about 30 keys. Well, let's get this shit on the road, cut it, zock it, and zack it...

And you owe those people something, too. No bet. Dig it, dope peddler. We're out here building a new nation for black people. It's time for you to start paying some dues, nigger. I ain't giving you shit. Now, I tell you what you do. You go get you a gun... And all those black folks you keep doing so much talking about get guns and come back ready to go down, and I'll be right down front killing whitey. Until you can do that, sing your marching song someplace else. Now, we're through talking. Like I said before, somebody's coming here to meet me. And don't let them find you here when they come. We'll see you again... Nigger. Ain't that a bitch, man? Hey, man. How you doing? Gentlemen, gentlemen. What's happenin'? You always got some Superfly shit...You know? How much you got? More than you need. What kind of cut can you take? That snort you just had was on a full. Damn. What kind of money we talking about? Mmm... That much. Let's get it on. O.K., I'll see you later, man. Those friends of mine want to buy a pound of coke. You know, baby, without being in it, you're about the best dealer I have. Oh, is that why you come up here? What kind of question is that? I mean it. Why do you come here at all? You know how I feel about you, Cynthia. No, I don't. I'd like to, though. I know exactly how I feel about you. All right. Look, I just finished running down a fantastic number. What's that supposed to mean? I'm getting out of the life. You can't do that, priest. You can't. You've got everything right here. I don't even know what it has to do with me. All I know is, I have to get out, to change the way I live. Am I supposed to be part of this big change? All right, I'll lay it right on you. This whole number is something I thought I wanted ever since I was a kid-- my hall, my vines... That wine you're drinking... And a woman like you. Don't you feel that way anymore? I don't know. Yes? Someone called Scatterman downstairs? Send him up. Yes, send him up, please. Thank you. When he comes up, I got to talk to him alone, so go in the bedroom. This is my house. Just do what I tell you! How'd you find this place? Sorry to embarrass you, but I'm running for my life. I need cash. You're coming to me for bread, man? You can't understand that shit, can you? All the money Scatter done made? I owned that restaurant... And damn near two square blocks. I caught myself gettin' late-- bank notes and mortgages... Nothing but little pieces of paper don't mean me no good now. What are you talking about? The man, he-- he's trying to kill me. What man? You ain't makin' no sense. The man you bought those keys from! He won't let me retire. And I trusted him. We came up together. I turned him on when he was nothin' but a rookie cop. He don't need me no more, man. I know too much. You mean we both in trouble. Don't square up, nigger! You think if he's tryin' to kill me that he'll let you out after you deal those 30 keys? He owns you now! I don't know what you're gonna do, young blood. What you gonna do? Run. That's all I can do. You'll let me have some money? Yeah. I got about 20,000 up at George's.

Hey. What do you think of Scatter Odin'? OD? Scatter didn't OD. Somebody killed him. Who do you think did it? Lot of people hated Scatter. How much stuff we got left now? About 1/2 a key out on the street. Let's take what we have now and split. Are you crazy? Now, you know damn well who killed Scatter. If we fuck up, he'll kill us, too. Besides... We got it beat. We'll make a fortune. So don't rock the boat, man. It's worse now than it was before. Look, that man owns us. You understand that, Eddie? To him we're not real. He'll just use us and then kill us. Man, people been using me all my life. Yeah. That--that honky's using me. So what? You know, I'm glad he's using me... Because I'm gonna make a piss pot full of money. And I'm gonna live like a prince, a fuckin' black prince! Yeah, this is the life. I could be nothin' nowhere else. And about his killing me? Shit, I don't care... As long as he lets me live to be an old motherfucker. And I ain't gonna do nothin' to make him kill me now. Suppose I could figure a way out of this shit. I ain't going. Fill it. Why don't you fill it? 'Cause I'm gonna keep my eye on you every minute, Eddie. Right. Right. He just left the apartment. Hold on. Lou, do me a favor. Send out a car. I want you to pick up a guy for me. All his money's with him? I'm calling you, ain't I? O.K. Get me the chief of detectives on line two. 185 to central-k. Lieutenant, one of our patrols have picked up your male negro suspect. And, uh, they got his briefcase, too. Good. Three detectives from my office are on their way to take custody. Have the patrolmen release the prisoner to them. Get going. We'll hold him till then. Come on, let's talk. So you're priest. I thought you were going to be the best dealer I ever had. What the hell do you want to quit for? What else can you do? You're making more goddamn money than you ever made in your life. You just want to be another two-bit black junkie. Well, I don't give a god damn where your head is. You're working for me until I tell you to quit. You don't own me, pig. No motherfucker tells me when I can split. Who the fuck do you think you're talking to? I'm talking to you, you redneck faggot. Freeze. You move a muscle, and I'll kill you. Kill me, Reardon. Kill me like you killed Scatter, and you are one dead pig. What did you call me? Deputy commissioner Reardon. Yeah, that's right. I know your name. I know all about you, your wife, that big-legged daughter of yours, and even that faggot son. Do it. Yeah, go ahead. I'm to the point I ain't afraid to die. But you kill me, and you and your whole fuckin' family die. That's bullshit. I ain't bullshittin' you, captain. I took a $100,000 contract out on your life, your wife, everybody. You'll all be hit if I die. Yeah, if I choke on a chicken bone, all the Reardons is dead. You ain't got $100,000. Not anymore. Offering to do my dirty laundry ain't gonna help you. And all them honky pig partners you got ain't gonna be able to protect your ass, either... Because... Case you thinking I'm trying to pull some of that old-time nigger shit on you, I think you ought to know something. I hired the very best killers there are. White killers. White ones, baby. So you better take good care of me. Nothin'...nothing better happen to one hair on my gorgeous head.
