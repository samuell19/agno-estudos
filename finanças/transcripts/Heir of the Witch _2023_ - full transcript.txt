- Oh, mama. Oh! My curse is too heavy and no one can carry it for me. - Welcome my child. We missed you. How long has it been? - Not long enough. - You must abide and continue the curse that you inherited. - I can't. - If you don't, then your child will. - I don't... I don't have a child. - This dress should fit her perfectly. - Anna, help me. Anna. Anna. - Auntie. - Anna. - Oh. I'm sorry. Auntie... She's back. - I know. I can feel her. The weaker I get, the stronger she becomes. - I'm afraid. I'm afraid I won't be able to defeat her. What are we gonna do? - ♪ Happy birthday to you. ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you. ♪ ♪ Happy birthday dear Chloe ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you. ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you. ♪ - The rain is coming. Let's move the party the inside. - Make a wish. - Why party wasted when you can burp and taste it, huh sis? - I'm so sorry it's storming on your birthday party. But we can still celebrate. - Anna... Move out of the way. - These are too dangerous for a child. Are they not? - When did you and Anna become such good friends? - Friends is a bit of a stretch, but she's an amazing seamstress. - Oh wow, that is beautiful. - So what is Anna wearing, anyway? - Anna, nice to meet you in person. - Likewise, sir. - Please, call me Nicholas. My wife can't stop talking about your dress. You've got a loyal customer here. - And did she think it was a costume party? - Shh. Do another one. - Ah! - You okay? What's wrong? - Hey kiddo. - Hi. - This is Dustin, he's-- - Hello. - He's Chloe's cousin. He lives downstairs, but he comes here often. - I see you've met my husband. Darling. - Okay. - Oh, you're so cute. - Our song, shall we dance? - Oh, my feet are killing me. Anna, you wanna dance in my place? Come on, he won't bite you. - ♪ Have you ever felt like someone's following you ♪ ♪ You think it's easy ♪ - Most of the people here are pompous assholes. That old money attitude. - Why do you keep such company around? - My clients. I'm a wealth manager. - Makes sense. - ♪ Have you ever felt like you're all that you have ♪ ♪ You keep your walls up to be ready for any attack ♪ ♪ Don't go ♪ ♪ Don't go ♪ ♪ Don't go ♪ ♪ Don't leave me here alone ♪ - Can you spare some change for a bite to eat? - I forgot my purse. - She's coming for you. - That is so cute. I can't believe Isabel only got me a bottle of wine. It's like she just spit in my face with that petty little gift. - That girl, your seamstress. - Anna? - Yeah, how old is she? - I don't know. Probably like around my age, I guess. I have an idea. Why don't we introduce her to Martin? - My partner? - Yeah. He's coming back into town tomorrow. We should all go out. - He's a player, hun. - Every player is just looking for the right girl to settle down with. - Okay, but Anna wouldn't like him at all. - He's handsome and rich, what's not to like? - There's a little bit more to it than that. Don't you think? - You just don't understand women. We have basic needs, good looks and money. - Anna. Anna! - Auntie? Rosie. You okay? Do you want some water? - No. Stay strong in the Lord. Evil is lurking. - Rosie. Rosie. Rosie. Rosie! Rosie, wake up! Rosie, don't leave me. - No. - It's ok. Shh. Shh. - Oh hey. - I, I brought your purse. - I told Chloe I would get it. Come on in. - So I was wondering, do you tailor clothes for men, like suits? - Yeah, I do, why? Do you want to get your measurements? I have some time. - Great. Who's that? - It's my grandmother. She never wanted to be in pictures. - It's a strange photo. - That's the only one I have of my mother. - Oh my gosh, she is beautiful. - Isn't she? - Is she still in Moldova? - No, she passed away when I was 14. - Oh. I'm sorry. - Shall we? My sewing room is right this way. You ready? - Ready as I'll ever be. Do you do anything else besides sew? - I tutor sometimes. Okay. - Anna? Hey, you okay? - Yeah. Sorry. - You just zoned out for a second. - Do you want some water? - Yeah. - Okay. - Sure. - Come this way. Make yourself comfortable and have a seat. - Your house is very nice. - It's all thanks to my aunt Rosie. I take care of her. - Wait, you take care of her here? Is she here? - Well, yeah, it's her house. - Well, can I say hi? - Um... She's just not well. She doesn't want any visitors. - You take care of everyone. Who takes care of you? - Well, I'm self-sufficient. I have to be. - Are you coming tomorrow night for dinner? - I don't know, maybe I'll think about it. - I'll take it. Do you wanna play a game? - Right now? - Yeah, why not? - Um... It's almost time for me to go and pick up Bonnie's kids, but otherwise I'd love to. - No, that's a stupid question anyway. I'll see you for dinner tomorrow. Okay? - So how was school today? - Good, I learned how to say rabbit in Spanish, conejo. And baby Rabbit is conejito. - You're so smart, Grace. Where did I put that ticket? - School is so boring. - Oh yeah? Who are you texting? - Nobody. - Is it Ty? - Is it Ty, is it? Why is everyone talking about that guy? He's awful. - You're only 14, honey. You'll get over it, I promise. Violet. Violet, stop. Violet. Violet, I'm trying to-- - What's wrong? - You guys okay? - Sure. - I hope everyone is starving. I know I am. What's up, brother? - Gosh, you looking good. Look at you. Looking sharp. - And you, my dear, must be the mystery woman that everyone seems to be talking about. I'm Martin. - Nice to meet you as well. - Can I get you started with a drink? - Yeah, I'll take the bourbon, top shelf, neat. Make it a double, please. Why is it that I've never seen you before? You on the run or something? You kill somebody and you're out here hiding with us? - Oh, she's been hiding behind her sewing machine. - I heard something about you making something for Nicholas. That's right? - Mm-hmm Yes, I'm making a suit for him. - A suit? - My drink. Yes, thank you. - My favorite. Here you go, oysters. What's the matter, you don't like oysters? - Actually, I've never had one. - Mm-hmm, first time for everything. - Gotta try it, here. Oh, you've got something. - I'm ready for a smoke, Martin. Let's go outside for a second. - Not right now. - Yeah, right now. - Excuse us, ladies. You, don't go anywhere. - Listen, I'm throwing a party this Saturday to raise money for a charity. You should come. - This Saturday. What charity, what is it? - I don't remember the name of the charity. It's something for animals or children. It's what rich people are supposed to do. - Interesting. - So, you can help me with the shopping and preparations, right? - Oh. - I mean, we'll pay you, of course. Martin will be there. - They're not all the same, man. Anna's different, okay? - She's no different than these right here, watch. Good evening ladies, how you doing? - Hey, there. - You guys want some drinks later? - Maybe. - Maybe. - Just like I said, they're all the same. - Anna is different. She's a sweet girl. - Motherfucker, your wife was a sweet girl. You see what that did for you, right? She still cheated. - Wow. Really, Martin? - I'm sorry. I know that was below the belt, but... I'm just saying, they only want two things, money... and dick. In that order. - This was a terrible idea. Why did I listen to Chloe? - Forget all that right now. I just flew in. I'm tired, but I still want to have some fun tonight. I'll take you guys out to the hot new spot. You might even get even tonight. Come on. - You look good. The boys are back in town. So, are we going out after this? - Absolutely. I'm going to take you guys to the hottest spot. - The Freaky Squirrel? - Yeah. - I don't think I'm gonna be joining you guys, though. - Come on, don't be lame. - I'm gonna go back to my lame life. You stay fabulous, okay? - Anna. Anna. Anna, I'm so sorry. My partner, he can be such an asshole sometimes. And you didn't deserve that. - It's not your fault, Mr. Hunt. - Well, you're clearly upset and for obvious reasons. I just want to apologize. - I just don't know why Chloe invited me. - I don't know why either, okay? It was a terrible idea and I won't let it happen again. - Goodnight, sir. - At least call me Nicholas. - Yes, sir. - Make sure you have the house clean by the time Nicholas gets home from work because he likes to drink his scotch and smoke his cigar in peace. I don't know why men smoke that nasty stuff. It makes their breath smell like they ate a big bag of shit. Oh, I'm pescatarian, and I love salmon, but make sure you only buy the wild caught salmon. I can't imagine eating the farm raised. Uggh, it's awful. - Mm. - You don't say much, do you, Anna? - What would you like me to say? - I don't know, like what do you want out of life? What are your aspirations and your goals? - Um... Well, I'm not very good at small talk, but... I want to be in love. I want to have a family. I'd like to have a child one day. I want to grow roots here. I think that's the most important part-- - Oh look, it's about time for my hair appointment, so I'll let you get back to work. I left your check on the table, so have fun. Bye. - Nobody cares. - Mama. Mamica, you came! Mommy. Mommy. - Oh Anna, my Anna. - Mommy. - Martin. - In the house. - Come here, remember Anna? Anna. Dustin's been asking about you nonstop. Would you be interested in teaching Dustin? Everyone's so impatient with him. I mean, we'd pay you, of course. - You know what, I'll do it. Dustin, you're my friend. - Go sit with Anna. - Your hair is pretty. - Dustin. I'm just gonna go and get some air, okay? - I'll come with you. - I'll be right back, I promise. - Hey. - Hey. - Is Dustin bothering you? He's a bit clingy, you know. - No, he's fine. - I think he likes you. What's so funny? - I'm sorry, nothing. Just um, looking at this beautiful view. - Not nearly as beautiful as what I'm looking at. - Nicholas, no. Something about her feels so familiar. - Well, well. This party just got interesting. - Martin, you are drooling. - Take this. She wants me, man. - I gotta go. - Who is that? - My next ex-wife. I'm about to change her life. How do I look? - She's got everybody's attention. Go for it. - Martin. - I really don't know what part of town we in right now. You gonna make it fun for me? You... You have a nice everything. Um baby, where'd you bring me? Damn. - Bye girls, I'll see you in a few hours. - Bye mom. - Thank you, Anna. - Fudge! - Violet, what's wrong? - Nothing. I can't stand Layla. - I thought you two are friends. - Well, she's talking with Ty now and they both make fun of me. - You know, you can't control how the world will treat you, but you can't control how you react to it. - Where's Grace? - Grace? Grace! Grace! Grace! Grace! Grace! Grace! Grace! Grace! Let her go! Let her go! Let her go! Let her go! Grace! Grace! I'm coming! My Grace, what did she say to you? I'm sorry. I promise I won't let nothing happen to you. - She doesn't want me. She wants you. - I hope we get better news soon. Thank you, detective. They found Martin's car at the edge of the forest, empty. - Any ideas where he might be? - Nothing. They didn't find anything. Oh, my head is spinning. - Can I get you anything? - I'm gonna, I'm gonna go lay down. Come with me, Anna. - Okay. - Oh, yeah. Right there, right there. It's better. Mm. Babe? - Oh, hi. - Did you hear about Martin? - Yeah, they called me. They're working in the city. - Aren't you gonna give me a kiss? Anna don't stop, please. He's acting so strange lately. - He's probably mourning for his friend. - Nobody said he died. - You're right. I misspoke, I'm sorry. You know, I'm gonna head home. It's late. - Well, there's some leftovers in the fridge. I was gonna throw 'em away, but maybe you'd enjoy them. - Get some rest, Chloe. I love making beautiful clothes for others, but for me, I only wear my mother's dresses. I feel her close to me. - Anna. - Dustin, what are you doing here? - I got you a flower. - Gosh, Dustin, you scared me. - It's pretty like, like you. - Why don't you take it in the kitchen and put it in some water, okay? Oh God, gonna gimme a heart attack. What are you guys doing? - Is my suit ready? - I have it right here. What do you think? - Wow. Should I try it on? - Yeah. - Ready. - You look absolutely amazing. - It feels amazing. - It looks good. - Anna, I can't stop thinking about you. I don't know what you did to me. I want to be there for you. Let's try this, try it once. - Why won't you eat? - I'm trying to keep my girlish figure. - I see you're feeling better today. - Anna, you're so beautiful. You smile just like your mother. - I miss her so much. - Me too. - You know sometimes I think of just going to Moldova and just kill him with my bare hands. - You hate him for the sin he committed, but your own hands are covered in blood. - You know, just because he's your brother, you shouldn't be on his side. - He's still your father. - He will never be my father. And how can you be on his side after everything he's done? I can't-- - I left him there in prison and I brought you here with me. - You know very well he had a choice. But I was just a child. I had... I didn't have a choice. - Anna, we all have a choice. - I didn't. I didn't. - I want to grow my hair long to touch the floor. - Your hair is part of your glory. It is your protective cover. - Mom, can I ask you a question? - Of course, my darling. - Was your father mean to you? - Your grandfather died when I was still in grandma's belly. - Why did he die? - Do you want hair your braided, or-- - Mary, come here. - Go to your bedroom and lock the door. - No. Then he is going to hurt you. - Go, now. Honey, food is ready, stuffed peppers, your favorite. - How long have you been fucking Stefan? - What are you talking about? - Don't lie to me. - What are you talking about? - I'll wipe that grin off your face if you don't fess up. - I don't know what you're talking about. Calm down, George. - Remember? Yeah. - I didn't do it! - Yeah, you touch him? I'm gonna touch you now! You bitch! - Mom, mom, mom, mom! Please! Mom, wake up, wake up! Wake up! Mommy, wake up! Wake up! Mommy, mom! - Dustin? Dustin? Dustin, open up. Dustin. Open up! Dustin, you can't hide in here. I'm gonna call Chloe. - Anna love Dustin. Anna love Dustin! Dustin stay! Anna loves Dustin! Anna loves Dustin! - I am not afraid of you. - Then face me. - She tortures me. She follows me. She tortures me. Her spirit dragged me to the dark hereof to remind me of what I've done. I don't know. I don't know what's real anymore, auntie. I'm so lost. I need your help. Please, please pray for me. I can't pray, Rosie. I'm too far gone now. She has me now, Rosie. Rosie, I can feel her presence everywhere. - You okay? - She was alive. My mama was alive. He beat her. He beat her and put her in a coma, but she was still alive. She was alive. I have to go, I've gotta, my mama. I miss her. - Listen, they wouldn't bury someone if they-- - Shut up! I'm sorry. - It's okay, it's okay. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to say that, I'm sorry. - I'm here, I'm here. I'll always be here. You look amazing today. - Really, thank you. I have something for you. It's a bracelet of the colors of my country, Moldova. I want you to wear it and always think of me. - It's beautiful. Thank you. Do you miss your home? - Well, this is my home now. The only good memories I had there were with my mother. - What about your father? - No! I hate you, no! I hate you! Stop! Shut up! Get in there! - I hope he rots in hell. - Daddy, open the door! Daddy, open the door! Please, daddy, please! - And your grandmother? - She died when I was a child. But she still haunts me every day. But I have you now. - Look. - Yes, the one! The curse must rise from the innocence of the pure at heart! - Dustin, come on and get out of here. Get out of here, I said! What do you think you're doing, huh? - Her, her, her smell is bad. - Well, she's sick. Do you understand? Dustin, why did you take this? - It's mine. - Why did you steal it though? - I not steal, it's mine! - You give it back to Nicholas, you hear me? I'm done with you! - Dustin not steal! - Nicholas. Nicholas. - What is this? - It's nothing. - Anna, tell me what that is. Because my entire marriage is based on lies and I can't have you doing that to me too. What is that? - It's the curse. It's written in the blood of my family over generations, including my own. - What are you saying? You're a witch? - I suppress the urge to indulge in the wickedness that I've been damned with. - Okay. Anna, you're freaking me out. - Stop this. I can't talk about this any more. Jane, it's me. It's the baby. Come now, please. - The baby's heartbeat is nice and strong, but you need to make sure that you stay hydrated. - Okay. - Okay? - I want her to come out already. - She's gonna be here before you know it. - Anna! I came as quickly as I could. Is she okay? - She's fine, she just needs some rest. Try to keep her from getting too anxious or stressed out. It's not good for her or the baby. Just rest up, okay? - Can you walk her out, please? - Yeah. - Jane, I can't stress to you enough how important it is to me and to Anna that this stays strictly confidential. We can't have the whole town talking about this. - My lips are sealed. - Thank you. - Look, I'm gonna be here for Anna and this baby. I just wanna be sure that you are. - I will be, thank you. - I need you here with me, more than you know. - I understand. - Then when are you gonna tell her? - Soon. - You said that before. That phone again. - I have to go. - What? You just got here. - It's important. - Important? How about your baby? How about me? When are we ever gonna be important to you? Everything comes before me. There is always a priority and it's never me. It's me, isn't it? You don't find me beautiful anymore. You don't love me anymore. I was a blooming flower and then you took everything from me. You took everything from me. You took everything from me. You took everything from me. Nicholas. Nicholas. Nicholas. Nicholas. - Anna. I've been trying to get in touch with you, but I see you've been busy. - Good to see you too. How have you been? - Great, I got a huge promotion at work. A killer celebration coming up for it. I would love a dress. You know, something with a deep cleavage and maybe some ruffles to hide the belly. - You know, I'm in a bit of a hurry and I don't have material right now, so I don't know if I can do that. - I can get material. Nobody does it like you, please. - I have to run. So, I'll catch up with you another time, okay? Tell the girls I say hello, please. - I'll call you about the dress, okay? - What's wrong? - Are you ever gonna tell her about me, about us? - Yes. Yes, soon. I promise. - When? Look at me, I don't have much time. - Anna, you have to wait. I have so much going on at work right now and our anniversary's coming up and I just don't want her to be alone for that. She might, she might do something stupid. - You leave me alone. Nicholas, you leave me alone every day. How about me? - Listen, I'm trying, I'm really trying here to do what's right. But she's an emotional mess. She might hurt herself. I'm waiting for the right time to talk. - There is no fucking right time, Nicholas, okay? You shouldn't have impregnated me if leaving your wife is so fucking hard for you! - I don't wanna fight! We were having a nice night. Look, getting upset isn't good for you or for the baby. Please. - Okay. Leave me alone. - Who's that? - I don't know. - What time is it? Oh fuck! - What's going on? - I'm late for my meeting. - What? Just wait for me to see who's at the door. Don't go nowhere. - Hey, good morning. I found the perfect fabric for the dress. The big party's on Friday, so I thought maybe you could get it to me by Thursday or maybe even Wednesday. I'm going for killer red to make an impact. - Bonnie, I wasn't expecting you. - I know, honey, I should have called, but I had an early morning meeting so I thought we could just do the measurements real fast. - You wanna do the measurements right now? - Yeah, is that okay? - Um... Just give me a moment. I just have to go change, so just wait here, okay? - Yeah, of course. Dustin left already. I don't know how he keeps disappearing like this. - Who was that? - That's Bonnie, she's getting a dress made. She doesn't even have an appointment. I don't know, she just showed up like this. - Tell her to go. - I, um... she won't be long. I'll be very quick. - Anna, tell her to go, now. We don't have time for this. I can't risk this. So please, just tell her to leave. - I'm gonna take her to the sewing room and then you can just go for the back, okay? - What's taking you so long? I have to leave right now. - Then just fucking leave, okay? Nobody's keeping you here. - Don't be a fucking smart ass. - Hey, Anna. Anna. - Don't come in, I'm naked. - Oh, okay. Do you have any cream or milk? My coffee's really strong. - Yeah, I'll be there in a minute. Just, hold on. Just wait here. Don't go nowhere. I'll take her to the back, okay? Just don't say nothing. - Do you have someone in there? I'm sorry. I thought I heard you talking. - No, I was just... I was just talking to myself. Let me get you some milk. - Okay. - Was that Chloe's... - I'd really appreciate it if you don't say anything. I'm begging you, please just... - Is he the father? - Do... Do you want to get the measurements done? - I don't need a dress right now, Anna, because I didn't realize our town had little sluts. - You don't understand. He's not happy. - So that's how you make men happy. What a wonderful woman you are. You need Jesus, honey, because you are gonna burn in hell. - Oh, Bonnie. You belong to me and I'll protect you with my life. I'll protect you from her, I promise you. - Give me the baby. Give me the baby! Give me the baby. I want it. I want it! Give it to me! It's mine. Your powers are nothing! Give me the baby. Give me the baby, it's mine. Give me the baby! - Bonnie, Bonnie leave and never come back! - You got the devil in you. You got the devil in you. Oohh. - Oh. Okay. I won't succumb to your powers! Hello. - Anna. How could you do this to Chloe? You seduced an innocent man. You're a fucking whore, just like Rosie. And you know what? You're gonna burn, burn in fucking hell, Anna. - Hi. I need to speak with Nicholas Hunt, please. - Um, yeah, he's in a meeting right now. If you wanna take a seat, I'll be right with you. Okay? - Could you please just tell him that Anna's here? - Ma'am, ma'am! You can't go back there. - This tie, it's... - I got it the other day. Excuse me for one moment. What are you doing here? - Who is she? - Ah, she's Jennifer. She's an intern. - I need you. The baby needs you. - Thank you for your concern and I really appreciate you coming by, but now is not the time. Okay? Anna, I can't talk right now. - Come to me. I'm begging you, don't leave me. I was giving him everything and I let him in. I give him everything! I trusted him! I trusted him! I let him in my bed. I let him in my heart. He doesn't even recognize me. He looks at me like I'm a stranger. The whole town's talking. They all think I'm a whore that I'm the villain and he's the victim! - Why are you so distressed? - I need somebody to hear me! - I saw a dancer today. She was a beautiful ballerina. She was dancing all around the room. She was so graceful. She was beautiful. But she told me she wasn't dancing for me. She said she was doing it all for you, but you weren't here to see it. - Oh Rosie, you smell so bad. These bedsheets smell so bad. I can't give you a bath, I'm sorry. - A bath won't help me now, my dear. It's the smell of death. - All my life, I lived in fear. She takes different shapes and forms. She always follows me and takes me into this dark space and tortures me. I'm so afraid. I'm terrified and I don't know what to do. - What you need to remember is that, that fear and jealousy and guilt is dangerous for you. Think about the medicines I use, they can help or they can hurt. It's all about how you use them and the intent behind it. Now, drink your tea. Midwife's orders. I promise, it's fine. - Jane. Jane, Jane. Jane, Jane! Jane? - Please stop. - Don't you recognize me? - Please stop, please stop. - Just another soul for the taking. Do a spell upon our unborn child. - Please, I said stop. Oh please... stop. Stop. - Anna. - Hey. Hey Chloe, you okay? - Will you please come over? - What happened, are you okay? - Please come. I'm begging you. - You don't sound well. Okay. Um... I'll come by later, okay? Chloe. - I need you to do something for me. - Anything you need. - I never thought I'd have to ask you this. I need you to give us some time. He says your name in his sleep. I know he's planning to leave me. Please don't rush it. - I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean for any of this to happen, I promise. - Yeah, me neither. - No, please no! Chloe, no! - Anna! - Rosie. - Evil is lurking. - Rosie. No. Bedsheets smell so bad. I can't give you a bath, I'm sorry. - The bath won't help me now my dear. It's the smell of death. - You killed my family! - You killed my family! - Come on. He won't bite you - A bath won't help me now, my dear. It's the smell of death. - Rosie, come back! Please. Rosie, Rosie! She's gone. Who's gonna take care of your baby? - I, I brought your purse. - I told Chloe I would get it. Come on in. I'd really appreciate it if you don't say anything, I'm begging you, please just-- - Is he the father? - Come on, we're gonna get you home, okay? - Ma'am, you need to come with me. - No, no, no, no, Nicky don't! Don't leave me, no, no. Not Nicholas, no! No, no. - Anna, Anna! - I didn't kill anyone. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. This curse will end with me!
