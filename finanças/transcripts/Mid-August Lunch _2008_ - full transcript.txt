"After visiting Monsieur de Treville, d'Artagnan, in a pensive mood, travelled the long road home. What thoughts could cause such a lengthy diversion, looking at the stars in the skies, now sighing, then smiling?" Speaking of d'Artagnan, what was he like? Physically I mean, to have this beautiful woman? He's nothing much I think. I never imagined him. It should be at the beginning. He was surely intelligent. It says: "Long, dark face, prominent cheekbones..." Okay, he's a man. "...a sign of cunning. Enormously developed jaw muscles, a clue to recognising a Gascon, even without his hat. - Wide eyes, intelligent." - He surely was. "A hooked nose." Beaked! That's it for me, I don't like him. I don't like men with beaked noses. Mom, shall we go on? Yes, go on reading, I like it, you mellow these hours. "His dreams fly so fast on the wings of imagination that d'Artagnan already sees the approach of a messenger from the young woman, who would give him a missive for a rendezvous, a gold chain or a diamond. Young nobles would receive, without embarrassment, gifts from their Sovereigns. In those days of loose morals they felt no shame as regards their mistresses either, who would leave them precious mementoes as if trying to conquer the fragility of sentiment with the solidity of gifts." ##Gianni?## Sweetheart? Right here! Coming. - Hello, Biagio. - Hi, Gianni. Pour me a nice white wine. - What did you give me? - A Ribolla Gialla. What else? Tonic water for Mum, and two Chablis. - Normal? - Okay. What's the tally now? Total's 46 euro. Want a bag? Write it down, please, then when this moment's over... Bye, thanks. - So, Viking? - Feel how hot it is? Cheers! You're not leaving town? No, with my mother... After all, it's not so bad here. What's new? Everything's as usual. Not saying anything? You're off to your mother. You even got her a cake! Well, it's my job. - There's a tourist or two. - Some just went by. They're so white. Hi, Gianni. Here, I'll help you. I wasn't expecting you. I rang the bell, but no one answered. Mom doesn't open. Nowadays... she's right. Alfonso, the situation hasn't changed. Don't worry, we'll talk it over. We already have. May I come in? Take a seat. Just a moment, I'll tell Mom. Take your time. Just a moment. He rang several times. I'm rather worried. So am I, I'll talk to him. - We'll face the situation. - Do what you can. Handle it in the best way. I wonder why he rang with such insistence. And why today of all days? - I don't understand why. - I'll go now. Want a beer? - No, thanks. - I need one. You have the usual papers and its August. I'm sorry, but the situation has got worse. I don't know what to do. The condominium has decided to take legal action against you. - The condominium? - All of them. But who? Especially the De Matteis. - Son of a bitch. - They all agree. They want a lawyer because you don't pay. You have to get moving. I know, but how can I with Mom? I'm always busy, my hands are tied. We all have problems. I have dermatitis. Dermatitis is nothing serious. It can give serious consequences. I have to go to the baths, I need mud packs... My wife and kids are already there and I can't go. Why not? Because my mother doesn't want to come. Do I leave her alone at home? No, of course not. Would you leave your mother alone? Listen... could she stay here for two days? - Who? - My mother. Are you crazy? I'm already loaded to the hilt. Your share of the maintenance and extra work on the terrace, I could erase it. I never use the terrace. I've seen you there. Then there are the gutters. I don't need to pay for them. You don't make that decision, it's the condominium. I'll credit you, I'll pay for you. Two days, put her here. Look at the light bill, 1,600 euro. What an exaggeration! You haven't paid in three years! They'll cut you off. There's the elevator too. What elevator? The key for the elevator. That's nice, for my mother and for me. But use it when they can't see you, with a little discretion. Otherwise they'll blame me. No, certainly. So, two days? The work on the roof, the elevator, the electricity! It's important. I'm pleased, but his ways... It's how he is. A little hick. We'll welcome her. We'll be ourselves and welcome her in the best way possible, because in the final analysis it's well worth our while. Yes, definitely. - May I? - Hello Gianni. - May I? - Hello Gianni. This is my mother. This is for you. A cake! Aunt Maria? Come, this is Gianni. Can we go in? Go right in. It's lovely. Here we are. Mom, come see the nice view. Look at the panorama! Pretty. Your mother? She'll be right along. So you all can meet. Where will Mom sleep? Right here, it's very comfortable. - It's good? - Yes, it opens up. No point opening it, I don't need a double bed. Sure, but it's comfortable opened up. This is your room. Can I try it out? I have a hard time sleeping. A big bed isn't necessary. Try it, go right ahead. Come here, give me a hand. Alfonso, help me. If it's not good, we'll change it. Lay down. Comfortable? He's a great cook. - I do okay. - And the menu? We'll choose the menu. Meat, fish... Hello, my dears. Welcome! And this lady? Aunt Maria! How nice to meet you! - What is it? - A cake. I love cakes. My mother makes marvellous ones. No, I'm sorry. I really don't feel up to keeping your aunt. Where can I take her on August 15th? Do I leave her alone? I'm not up to it, it's humanly impossible. Drop her at the train station? I understand but... - For the trouble. - What can I do with this? I have expenses. They eat like birds, they're no expense. With all I took off, the maintenance, the extra work... - Her health? - A rock. She just forgets things sometimes. - She has hardening of the arteries? - Sooner or later we all do. Let's get this ready. - Her nature? - She's docile. She stays put. Remember, at 10 p.m. an aspirin for both of them. Aunt Maria, don't get up. Here's hoping. See you tomorrow, goodbye. - Come back soon. - Tomorrow. - I'll take you to the door. - No need, stay with them. I'm so thirsty, won't your son bring some Coca Cola? - Wait. - Maybe he forgot. You're wearing an apron, that's going overboard! Won't you sit with us? Not today, maybe tomorrow. You're invited tomorrow. - Or else it's not a holiday. - Okay. He's been working so hard. Your son can cook really well. - Maybe better than you. - What do you know? I taught him. Teach an art, save it for a rainy day. - Is your son married? - No. He's had his likings, but they didn't end up well. Your fault, right? Jealous mom. I'm getting your bed ready. You're good. You'll be fine here. Do you want your pillow here or there? The pillow there. - Do you have children? - Yes, two. Where are they? One lives in the suburbs and one here in Rome. In Via Cesare Baroni. They're on vacation now? The younger one is, the older one, not yet. I see, that's nice. I see, that's nice. Here you are, look. What do you say? Sit on it, see if it's too soft. - Sit down. - It's fine. It's soft. Now youre all set. I have to ask you a favour. The administrator's mother wants the TV. Still got that apron? I'm working, try to understand. It's too much. Let her have it. I'm pleased, they're together by themselves, watching television and I'm less involved. We do this gladly, but... gladly up to a point. There's give and take, but it's a little demanding. Why, is something wrong? Nothing's wrong exactly, but I'll tell you straight out: that Aunt Maria is a bit hard to take. She says the same things over and over, about these two children, it seems that... One's the mayor of Frascati, the other's a postman, but what a postman! Then there's that other little aunt. She seems very nice. She is, just a little funny. She brought us that cake, I thanked her very much, but it was covered with a bidet towel! I was about to tell her... You're right, but let's not get snippy, this is an emergency. Let's not get snippy. But we can comment among ourselves. You'll see, with this... Let's see what you can do. Okay? - Look. - It doesn't look good! It'll be warmed up in five minutes, you'll soon get a good picture. Trust me, wait five minutes. Have faith. Good grief, just look at that. Marcello. Thankyou for coming. There's a situation here... that's a little... Come in here, we won't be disturbed. Cough. Stronger. Nothing. You don't have a hernia. Know where you have one? Here. The minimum is 110. Is that serious? No, it's not serious, but... Let's say... you should consume less salt. That pain you told me about? A slight thing, I don't always have it, only when I run or climb stairs. It's a little pain right here. - Down your arm? - Sometimes. - To your fingers? - Sometimes. Which fingers? It's a stable angina. Stable, don't worry. Thankyou. Let's get through this holiday and then come to me, no one's in the hospital now. We'll do a check-up to see clearly so you can relax. Thankyou very much. Don't thank me, I have something to ask you. My mother's Rumanian careperson has returned to Rumania and today I have the night shift. You have to keep my mother for the night. Please. Say you will. How's your mother? Fine. Take a deep breath with your mouth open. Once again. Again. - Alright? - Another deep breath. - Alright? - Don't worry. I'll ask you to breathe. Another deep breath. Is the parmesan okay like this? Yes, just a little more. Now this mozzarella. - You add it. - This wasn't cut up. Let's cut it by hand, we're like family. - Don't use it all. - Don't we want a crust? It takes the right oven to get a crust. We have to see that it doesn't burn. Like a drop of wine? I've got good wine. Yes, just a bit. With a little water? Yes, with a little water. It's a shame, but I'll do it. At breakfast Mom takes Amlodipine for blood pressure, half a coloured pill, her medicines are in the suitcase. Twenty minutes before lunch, for digestion, a tablet of Domperidone and the same before dinner, twenty minutes before meals, Domperidone for digestion. Before bedtime, the other half of the Amlodipine. Foods which must absolutely be avoided, they're poison for Mom: milk, cheese and dairy products. She's intolerant, she gets violent headaches. Note: no tomato sauces for supper. Cooked tomatoes give her acidity and Please, go right inside. - See you tomorrow. - At noon. Here we are, make yourself at home. May I introduce a lady, Maria. I'm Grazia. Come with me. We're making a macaroni casserole, I'm waiting for it to cook. Macaroni casserole? You made a macaroni casserole? I love macaroni casserole. I'll show you your room, then we'll be back. It's lovely, so green with all these tall trees. This room is very nice, thankyou. - It's simple. - No, I like it. Thankyou. Settle in, call if you need anything. I'll call you to the table in a bit. Grazia's here, want to say hello? Honestly, if I could avoid it, I'd rather stay here. Actually, I wanted to ask you something, could you bring back the TV.? I'm used to watching the news. - Of course. - Can you do that? I'll try, of course. Say: "My mother is a little..." Don't worry. With parmesan, mortadella, sauce, until you've used it all. - Then you put it in the oven. - What a wonderful smell! Marina, listen. - I have to take it. - Again? I'm very sorry, but I have to take it. Are you serious or are you joking? I'm fed up with this, take the TV. and get out! My children don't want it with white sauce. It's good. There was a woman who wanted to teach me to make it with white sauce, but my children don't want it. They say: "Make it your way, we don't like white sauce." Every time they come to my house, they want a macaroni casserole. Grazia, sorry, you can't eat that, you can't eat it, Marcello... In a while I'll prepare a plate of cooked greens, some delicious carrots. Please, you can't eat this. She can't even have the macaroni casserole? No macaroni casserole, you'll have vegetables. - Me? - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You don't knowhow good my macaroni casserole is. Don't tell me that! Marina? Open the door please, I have to set the table. We'll all eat together, open. No, I want to be alone. What? Let's work this out. - I don't want to. - You're not eating? I don't want to eat, I'm staying here. Grazia, here you are. These are steamed, delicious and very light. Thankyou so much. They're vegetables nonetheless. I'm having macaroni casserole, I don't want that. Don't rub it in. My son is so good, I have to be careful, it's true. Rather than eat those things, I'd go without eating. You're supposed to take that pill. This is Domperizon... That one there, you take it twenty minutes before meals. I'm sorry, I was late. That's alright, take it now. Your mother's not coming? I'll call her. We'll wait for her. Dinner's ready! Why in the kitchen? Because that other lady... Never mind, I set up in the kitchen. The two of us can eat there, but not with guests. I know, but it's an emergency, let's not be snippy. I'm not snippy, but I have to say: I really don't want to. Today is a little unusual, dear ladies. Excuse me, but... someone's a bit snippy. It's nice you're both good-natured. Excuse me just a moment. Darn it. Good guy. Yes, but I told him we needed broad-cut pasta dough, but he bought something else. - Let's hope it's good anyway. - It looks wonderful. I can't eat it, but... Marina? Sure you won't eat? I'll bring you a tray. Would you like a drop of wine? I can't drink it, I'd better not. Maria can. Sip it. - I'll have a drop myself. - Call your mother! I already told you, eat up. It's impolite to eat without her. Yes, we're sorry,. Call her again. I just can't, have a sip. First we eat, then we drink. Here we go. You liked it though, eh? Yes, I did. I have to confess I was too drastic in my reply, I feel sorry,. I'd like to do something to set things right. That's good. Invite them to watch TV, with me, in talking, we might patch things up. I'll try to be as kind and affectionate as I can. Look who's here. You brought them, thankyou! The ladies would like to watch some TV. - What a pleasure. - I'm so glad to see you. It's just them, and Marina? Marina... doesn't feel well. - What? - She has a slight headache. Is it true or we don't know? Can't we do anything? Don't worry, I'll take care of it. What would you like, a camomile? I'd gladly have one. Will you make it? Careful with the fire. - It's like being there. - Yes, they're done very well. Here are your camomile teas. How sweet of you. Your table... We're quite taken by this program. My dears, let's have some. Would you like some sugar? How many, two? How nice, no sugar for me. Would you like a nice cup of camomile? You had a pleasant childhood, in fact, you carry it with you. Show me the staff of command. This staff has always been crooked. You were forced to swallow some things, you were a strong person. We had a disastrous financial crack and then Gianni died, my husband, my great love. I'd loved him since I was 15. That's how we courted, from one courtyard to the other, that's what the times were like. Then I stood up to my parents and got married, it was a wonderful marriage. - It shows. - You're so good, thank you. You know, I feel uplifted. You'll reach one hundred, you know? But not with a careperson. You're not the type. That's no fun. Don't think about it. I see so many like that. Don't think about it. Now read mine. What a tiny hand! You're so dear! You are very lucky. I'd say youre lucky. I don't know if your life really was, but you've got a nice life, you were able to keep it under control, I think that's what I see. Show me the staff of command. It's not crooked, it's nice and straight. It's nice and straight. Maria? Are you hot, are you alright? - I'm a little hot. - I'll turn this on for you. Grazia, have you seen Marina? No, I don't even know her, I'd have noticed. Haven't you seen anyone? I've been here the whole time. Are you crazy, you scared me to death! What happened? - You just got up and left. - Certainly! On a evening like this, I want to be outside. But I'm responsible for you! I'm my own personal responsibility. I feel good here and I want to enjoy this evening. You can just leave. Please, come home with me! No way in the world! I'm drinking, smoking, you want to take me home already? Cheers. Come on, please. Please, I'm tired. No, you can say whatever you like. I'm tired! I feel good here, I'm staying. I'm smoking, drinking, if youd like to join me, don't think twice. - Want a drop? - I'm too angry. Have a drink, it calms everything. Listen, now... Don't worry, you're sleeping here. Leave it, we'll do it together later. We have to sleep, it's late. - You don't understand. - Later. Come now, let's play cards, you'll forget you're tired. One to one, sit down. Will you sit down, please? I didn't want to come home so soon. You're a young girl, but I can't take any more, I'm tired, I've worked. And now you rest, I'll sing you a lullaby. No, you go to bed. I'll tuck you in, I want to see how you sleep. I can't even stand up. Look, my dear... - What are you doing? - You don't need these. Marina, stop it. Why stop? - I'll give you a kiss and leave. - What good's a kiss? And I'll leave again. Then let's play cards. - We'll finish our cigarettes. - And then? And that's all. I'm afraid to sleep alone. Sweetheart, I can't help that. You have to understand me. You're stronger than me, you're a rock! Marina? - Let's see. - Mercy. Out with the truth, you're not tired. I'm dead tired. You're pretending to be tired, I see it in your eye. You have a smart little eye! - I'll go make you a camomile. - For you. Camomile tea, for me? Camomile, at my age? What kind of idea is that? Come on, sit down. Come on, five minutes. Five minutes. You even took my shoe off. Grazia! You ate all the macaroni casserole! Give it here. I can't leave you on your own. Another little piece. I can't leave you on your own. That's the truth of it. I have wonderful memories of Assisi too. I have wonderful memories of Assisi too. We live on memories. Without memories, what would you do? You think of the house you lived in, your grandmother, who had to be helped down the hall when she went to bed, because you had to help her take her stockings off. So many wonderful memories. It's really cold in Assisi in winter, I used to get chilblains, I'd almost forgotten. I was always scratching my feet because of the chilblains. And when he came, he'd take me out, I had to get up at 7, I'd get up at 7 to go to Mass. Grazia, listen. Now let's try to sleep, at least 15 minutes. I've always lived in beautiful homes, the one in Bologna was very beautiful too, it was a grand building. I like thinking about my childhood because old age offers so little, so you walk back through the years. I love remembering. They made tortellini in Bologna... See how beautiful it is! Yes, but I don't want it so fancy. We desire this at every age, but especially at ours. A close friendship, which is better than one you go to bed with. It's a close friendship, a nice person who takes you to dinner, who invites you to the theatre, one you can take a trip with. He's intelligent, but not a young person. Maybe you already know him. - No, I don't have any friends. - It's important that you want it. I'd like to, why not. Good morning. See how pretty she is, our friend with this hat! What a pretty hat you picked! - Isn't she sweet? - Very sweet. Listen Gianni, I came in here to find out where the tablecloth is for the Ferragosto dinner, we have to do something a little more special. - What dinner, today... - The Ferragosto dinner! But today's the day... - Today... - Today, what? Today the ladies are leaving. - There have been some changes. - We're self-invited. But there's nothing to eat, I have four eggs and a salad. You've always done the shopping, haven't you? Valeria? Don't be offended. I'd like to offer the dinner, I have the money. I'm offering. If it's not enough, I'll give you the difference when you're back. We want to contribute. Alright. If they want to contribute, let them. I'm looking for some fish, but there's not a soul around. Let's see if that one's open. - That guy? - Its August, what's around? Let's go see. - He'll be expensive. - We'll talk, its August. I told you, now for the fish? Let's take the scooter. Let's go see if someone's open. Someone must be open. Is this all you have? - No, I've got more. - Where? - Over there. - Let's go see. Here they are. See what nice fish. Look, small mullets. Have you got a corkscrew? I should have one here. Here it is. - Open it. - Let's have a little wine. Do you have glasses? Yes, I do. I've got everything. Cheers! Good thing there were some potatoes. Keep cutting. Slowly, we're in no hurry. - Can I go with the fish? - Go. It's blasted hot... The last drop. - We'll eat this up, and how! - Sure will. - This is fine. - So that's... Ten euro a plate. You'd ask ten euro a plate? - How old do you think he is? - I don't know. He's got beautiful eyes, he's interesting. I said the same thing. You gave it a thought or two, eh? For a good friendship, nothing wrong with that. She's dangerous, you know. Like that, bubbly... It's Ferragosto, let's do something fun. I'll seat you together, so you'll make friends. Happy Ferragosto! - Here you go. - Thank you. Here you go, Maria. Drink up Viking, this is good. Excellent, I'd say. Just a drop for me. Very little, don't worry,. I get tipsy. Raise your chalices to our nice friendship of Ferragosto. Hurrah for us! Hurrah for this delicious meal. Is your son still at the hospital? Good, at least you can eat relaxed, he'd have kept you from eating. Right! You spoke the truth. He's such a good boy, but I'm glad that today... I'm going to freshen up. Why, are you that hot? It's hot. That's a little odd, he needs freshening every minute? You know Viking... Think he's hot because... ##Peut-être. Peut-être, maman, oui.## To us! We've had more toasts on this Ferragosto than at New Years. Makes up for when you had too few. Did you have too few? Let's just be glad for these. Your cell phone. Hi, Marcellino. So, what are you doing? Marcellino will be by soon. Yes, I'll get her suitcase ready. In perfect health! She's had her pills and not only that, she kept to her diet. He'll be here in half an hour, see you soon. You leaving? Marcellino will be here soon. Marina, I have to call Alfonso. No, please! We're so content and having fun! - It's the deal. - But the day's not over. It's not over, but meantime, I... It's to his advantage too. Let's let him have his Ferragosto! - It's all so sudden. - It's all so hurried. That's how it is, it's in the deal. He'll take Aunt away too? Yes, it was all in the deal. But, all so suddenly? Okay, you're right. Slowly, slowly. I'll wait another while, but then I'll call. - The happiness is gone. - After all our toasting... What a shame. Marcello... I've prepared your suitcase. I'll see to Marcello. But this evening we'll have something light, a vegetable broth. Yes, with parmesan.
