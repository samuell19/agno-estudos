FUJI TELEVISION AUTUMN YEAR 3 OF KŌKA ERA (1847) TEA HOUSE GRAVE OF JOSHU DRIFTER MONJIRO YEAR 12 OF TENPŌ ERA (1842) What? This is hot water! Yes, it is. Not only tea leaves, but flowers for our famous sweets are hard to come by these days. You better not charge it as tea! Kisoji's heavy rain must have damaged crops. Besides, I heard the silk trading businesses in Joshu are having some kind of trouble right now. Difficult time it is. No wonder our businesses are not doing well. - Pops! - Huh? There is a grave in an odd place outside. Is that for your relative? No, it's for a drifter. Who put it there? I did. What is the story behind it? Do you want to know? You can't help it, can you? The other day, I saw a travelling toseinin (outlaw) paying respects at the grave. But these days, not many people stop by. The grave is for a toseinin. It happened five years ago. Back then there was a gambler called Monjiro from Crescent Moon Village, Nittagori, Joshu. Then, he got attacked by two men up on Nojiri Hill. It was early evening, but so dark with heavy rain. I could not see anything. However... I could hear their voices. Hey, Kogarashi Monjiro! I am Hachibei of the Kamieda family, and I am here to avenge my brother, Boss Jubei! What are you doing?! Come help! Attack! There! Hurry up! It was far, and dark, and I could not see well. But there was no way to survive that fall into the turbulent Kiso River. I knew they were gone. His name was Kogarashi Monjiro, who was a well known gambler in his world. You must have heard his name before. What? Haven't heard about him? I've never heard about him. Yes. Have you met him? Only that one time. People said he was very different. He had a rather good reputation despite being an outlaw. So I felt sorry for him, and decided to build a grave for him. Let's go now. Why are there many sticks instead of incense by his grave? Because Monjiro used to have a long toothpick in his mouth. Some of the toseinin know that, so they put sticks to pay their respect for him. Bye now. Yes. It seems like Monjiro has been completely forgotten. I guess five years is a long time.

From Nojiri village, walk south on the Kiso road for 10 miles and you will find Mitono village. Then down through the rocks by the river, and there is the Owari clan's forest, deep inside Kiso mountain. "A tree for a head." Felling trees in the government forest was strictly prohibited and heavily punished. Only municipal lumberjacks called somabito were allowed to cut trees. They were honest hard workers with pride. Boss! Good morning! Good morning! Monjiro! This is "Mo," for Monjiro. This is called Mokuza. When workers meet my expectations, I present this sign to congratulate them for their hard work. From now on, put this letter into all of your trees. Your pay will be different, so it's a big deal. Yes. Congratulations! You worked hard. You are lucky to have a great Boss! In five years, you became more skilful than me! Great! Otami! Koheiji my brother! How is dad? Hey! You startled me! Brother! I thought you were dead! How have you been? You have grown up fine. Did you find a husband? No news from you for six whole years has made us worried sick! I've been in Kizaki in Joshu. I'm so glad you are back! Well, I came back to say good bye. Huh? Now I am famous "Benten" (one of the 7 Lucky Gods) Koheiji of Joshu! Otami, we will have a celebration for Monjiro tonight! Ready? Father! Glad to see you again. What is it! I joined the Gorozo family of Kizaki, Joshu-- What a big fool! How could you come home like that! Sorry, I have not come home for a long time. I apologize. But finally I became a respected man with a big job. That is why I came back from Joshu... Shut up! This place is not for outlaws. I'm a Soma "Gashira" (head of Soma), and I cannot have a son like you! So go away right now! Father, he had a reason to come home. Let him speak once. You will be quiet! Go away before you disrespect Lord Owari's forest! Right now! Hurry! What a waste of my time. After I came all this way! Damn it... Wait! Move! You're in my way! Monjiro. Brother! Be quiet. I don't want to be seen. Don't you understand how father feels? This job is so big and risky that I have staked my life on it. Why would you do such a dangerous thing? I came to say goodbye because this may be the last time I see all of you. Is it in Joshu? Otami! Joshu is a great place! There are so many beautiful kimono, too. Why don't you come to Joshu when you get tired of Kiso's mountain life. I'll take care of you! Well, goodbye. Joshu is presently part of Gunma prefecture, and we used to call it Kozukeno-kuni at the time. From Kiso, it is a 150 mile trek to the north, and travelling by foot takes almost 6 days. Joshu's main business was growing silkworms and silken textiles, and the silk industry was booming in olden times. The towns of Kiryu and Isezaki were always busy with many silk merchants with big trading markets. Most farmers grew silkworms, harvested their cocoons, boiled them to threads, and wove them into fabric to support themselves. So how is it? At this moment, only 12 or 13 people... No, that's not enough. We need at least 30 people from this village. As I told you before, it's not only Kizaki folks who organize the silk trade, but everyone, including farmers like you guys. That's why I'm working hard, Ushimatsu. Please keep up! Otherwise I'll lose face. The boss is a very scary man! "GO" Mother, it's ready. I added extra ginseng. Please drink it and get well. Thank you very much. But why don't you let Omachi do these kinds of things? I know... Gorozo, what are you waiting for? You don't have to be shy around her just because she was a former boss's daughter. Why don't you make a move and marry her? You don't have to worry about her. I'll take care of it. Boss. Kiryu's owners are here to see you. Well, well. Tomioka, Ashikaga, and Inubushi from Kiryu! Welcome here. How is your mother? We came here to pay her respect. These are the gifts for her. Thank you very much. Please come in. Don't let anybody into the guest room. Come in, please. Your devotion to your mother is famous in Joshu. I'm just being a son. By the way, about the numbers... Finally, we got enough numbers. Well, that is why we came here. We got the letter from the government. They said there will be be an extra tax on-- ...for clothes, silver 2 bu, 5 rin; for yarn, silver 1 bu; for silk floss, silver 5 bu... This is outrageous! We have paid enough taxes already! More tax! What do you think we should do? Now is the time for action! How many people do we have so far, boss? 3,000. That's not enough, we need 5,000 more. That could be expensive. Wow! Watch out! Boss! Boss! Somebody bring a stretcher! Omachi, are you reading a fortune? What do you see? I am not reading fortunes... Then what is it? I'm just seeing the truth. Omachi. Tonight, are you... Boss. There will be 800 men from Shibukawa village! Oh, hope we are not interrupting. Don't worry. We are just talking about a fortune reading. Ms. Omachi's reading is so accurate! She must have a special talent! Boss, you're so lucky to have a guest like her from the Jubei family of Kamieda. Quiet! Kogarashi Monjiro. Huh? Monjiro is coming from the west. Hey, hey wait a minute. Are you talking about "Cold Wind" Monjiro? Don't be foolish. He has been dead for five years. No, Monjiro is alive. He is dead. He fell from the cliff into the Kiso River. This time, you are very wrong. But I can see him, Monjiro... Monjiro. Yes. Do you know Boss Gorozo of Kizaki? No. He controls the entirety of eastern Joshu. He seems ordinary, but I heard he is actually notoriously evil. I can't believe Koheiji became a member of the Gorozo family. Father, let's not talk about that. It makes you upset. He told Otami that he's going to do something very dangerous. Monjiro. Yes. You are no longer a roving gambler. Became a fine lumberjack. Get married to Otami and settle down here. That is your destiny. Father... please take it easy. Having said that, I have to ask you... to be... an outlaw... one last time. Boss... I'm not saying you owe me because I saved your life five years ago. Now I have become so ill and I won't be here for much longer. I really want to bring Koheiji back home while I'm still alive. Would you please listen to my wish? He's dead. How about that one? - Alive! - All right! When did Koheiji leave? A year before you arrived. He started to gamble, so I scolded him quite seriously. Then he ran away. I am worried about brother, but Monjiro is not responsible for Koheiji. Besides, bringing him back is a dangerous job. How could you ask Monjiro to do that kind of thing? Goodnight. They are yours from the day we found you. I kept them in here. I knew that. I don't want you to use them ever again. You don't owe anything to my father. I'm glad you believe that. You are no longer a toseinin. No need to feel guilty. Otami, don't worry. I'll never be an outlaw again. Monjiro. Boss Gorozo! What is it? Nothing... He is always like that... - Boss. - Yes. Today, we'll debark the trees. Have you seen Monjiro? Did you give him other work to do? I did not... Monjiro... What? Omachi is gone? Yes, since last night. Do you know where she went? No idea. She must have gone to look for Monjiro. This is bad. Are you leaving already, mister? I have many places to stop by. Like an express delivery. Bye! Wow! Who are you? Are you Koheiji? Yes. What of it? I'm here to take you back home. You must be confused. I never met you before, and I'm in a hurry. Move! KIZAKI TOWN All together, there will be around 200 to 300 people from the Yamamuro and Sakamoto villages. All right. Make sure you are not found by the police. Of course. What about Omachi? Well, we're still looking for her. I apologize. Boss, we're trying. I see... What a clever idea to create a fake farmer's riot in order to stop the extra tax. Greedy silk merchants are notoriously clever! They got the idea from Tenmei's Riot from 65 years ago. Yes. I wonder if gangsters like us plotted the incident back then. This time will be the same. Once the riot starts, some angry farmers will break into stores and steal everything. Then, we take it all away from those farmers. The government will halt the extra tax immediately in fear of more riots. Then, the silk merchants are happy and we'll get plenty of rewards from them. Farmers are to blame for everything. I feel bad, but so what. The police have to arrest whoever leads this riot. That will be Ushimatsu, Kumataro, and Koheiji. They will end up in exile. Poor things, but I already convinced them quite well. Then everyone else is safe. How many people came today? Three from my village... Listen! The government will soon impose an extra tax, so we have to hurry. Ushimatsu is right! Can you get another 60 from your neighbouring village? By the way, somebody is talking to the police about our plan. Is it true, Kumataro? If someone from this group is doing that, I will not forgive you. Understood? Anyway, where is Koheiji? Hasshu official! INN Hey, can't you do something with the rope? Who are you really! Hey, are you really not going to feed me? You won't have any energy to escape without food. Heartless bastard! It is you who doesn't appreciate your father. What did you say? Your father is in his bed from a serious injury. Huh? He wants to see you before it's too late. If you behave, I'll set you free. What do you want me to do? He won't get better, even if I go back. By the way, he was the one who kicked me out! I decided I will be alone, as no more "father and son." Right now, my boss Gorozo is the most important! Go back to Kiso to tell my father that. Fool! I did it! Hey! One cold saké please. Yes. Hey, young lad! You're a gambler, aren't you? Where is your boss? Why don't you hire me as your family's bodyguard? My fee is very reasonable. This is too sudden and... I'm in a hurry. See, my saké is empty, too! Are you kidding? Besides, why would I want to help you? I'll show you how skilful I am! What are you doing? Hey! Help me out... we are on the same side as toseinin! What cruelty! Hey! Are you going to watch me die? Shit! Bastard! Who are you? You seem more skilful than expected. Let me take care of you, too! Well, he's not bad. what a toseinin... He is skilful... What... Koheiji?! You startled me! I have been watching you since you walked in. Where have you been? To Kiso. Oh well, not a big deal. How about you? Why are you here? I'm looking for a man. Huh? You found someone important in your life. Don't be silly. Anyway, what happened to your arm? Well, being a gambler means living with injuries. Enough! Come down here so I can take care of it. Yes. You are a very kind lady. I have a favour to ask of you. What? Don't flatter me. What? I don't! I've known it ever since I met you. You are still not answering my question. Where have you been? I'm working for Boss Gorozo. For the boss? For this riot, I have to gather farmers with Ushimatsu and Kumataro. What? Boss didn't tell you about this? I don't know about it at all. Well, was it supposed to be a secret? Don't worry. I don't want to get involved in such a thing anyway. When you are reading fortunes, you look quite serious and scary. Oh, do I? I didn't realize. What are you trying to see? To find out where my mortal enemy, who killed my father, is. Your father? Was he Boss Jubei of Kamieda? It had happened before I joined the family, but I heard that when Boss Jubei died, Boss Gorozo took over the Jubei family and welcomed you as a guest. That what I heard, Boss Jubei was more important to me than my real father. I can see him... Here! How... How did you find me here! This is the man I'm looking for! Koheiji... You asked farmers for their clothes for your bandage near here. So he is the one who killed Boss Jubei! How have you been, Omachi? But I guess we met at the inn. You missed the target. I missed then... But this time, I won't let you live! I will assist you! I did not kill Boss Jubei. Don't you recognize this toothpick? This was in my father's neck! No excuses! You can see the different lengths. Mine are all a very specific length. Besides, real killers never leave evidence like that. Omachi, don't wait! Otherwise he will kill us both! Make a first move in order to win! Omachi, let's go! Hurry! Hurry! Who is Monjiro to you? My father asked him to take me back to Kiso. This job brings me a step up in the family. So he can not be in my way! Koheiji, please hurry to Kizaki. Ki-- Kizaki? It's important! Let me whisper. Huh? Nobody's here. Come closer! GOROZO'S PLACE There are odd rumours going around. I thank you for your hard work, Asaka. So what brought you here today? You seem like having a difficult time gathering enough farmers. What's this about? No need to pretend you don't know. I have no intention to stop or arrest you. Then what do you need? I could report to the office that there will be more than 10,000 farmers in this riot. I see... Then I expect more, you know... Kumataro! Yes. How many times have I saved you so far? Well, once for fraud, once for a break-in, and once for adultery, so total of three times. Don't forget you owe me big time. I could not leave because of Ushimatsu... Handle all matters professionally as you are my informer. So, what's the date? Yes, it is... What? Kumataro? Koheiji. You saw Omachi and the drifter. Boss, why is this man so important? Why were you there anyway? The Nakasen-do (Central Road) used to be called the Tosan-do Road and went through the mountains of the Azuma area to connect Mino, Shinano, and Joshu. The Nakasen-do is one of the shogunate's 5 main roads that connect Edo to Kyoto. Head east, and you pass the Usui Pass to enter Joshu. Are you looking for Koheiji? I thought you were with him. I have no idea where he went. What are you doing here? I see something bad. Boss Gorozo's mother is getting worse. Where did you learn to see such things? I was born like this... I was travelling around with my mother who was a street performer. I was a very mysterious kid. I was able to see things that nobody else could. Mother used me to make a little money. Ready? Bet! I saw the contents of people's wallets or the numbers of the dice in gambles. Even of 4! We made a little money and moved to another town. As a young girl, the days were harsh and painful. Then I met Boss Jubei at Onuma, the silk trading town. Boss really liked my gift, and wanted to adopt me as his daughter. What a terrible person my mother was. She sold me for 30 ryo to Boss Jubei. But I was happy. Because of him. I could wear nice clothes, eat good food. All I had to do was to read the numbers of dice at the gambling table once in a while. He was really nice to you. Then the nice boss got killed! I want to tear the killer up with my bare hands! Where is your home town? I cannot remember. Is anybody waiting for you? Nobody. You're alone? Same as me. Omachi, please escape to the other side! Huh? An unknown crowd is coming! Now! Go! Monjiro! You can't fool me with such an excuse! I got you! Get him now! Don't let him escape! Why are you attacking me? Are you out of your mind? I'll take your life! Get away! Halt! The Gorozo family why did they try to kill me? What a great looking carp! I ordered it from a fisherman of the Tone River. I want my mother to eat something nice. You are really kind to your mother. Then? He is here, in the back. Ushimatsu, good work. Kumataro, I heard you gathered a lot of people. I tried to work hard. I want to give you a reward. What? Oh, I don't deserve it. You sew very well, like a proper woman. I never imagined I would have to spend the night in a place like this. At this time, it's impossible to pass through the checkpoints. Hey, are you still mad at me? At the riverbank. I tricked you. But I did it because I really believed that you were the one who killed Boss Jubei. I never kill people who are good to me. Then who did it? What is it? Calm down. Nobody is there. How frightful... why did I see such a thing? You must be tired. Hey, would you stay with me? I won't be able to look for Koheiji in the dark anyway. How about tomorrow? Stop at Boss Jubei's grave, then head to Kizaki. I might go to Kizaki first. I must find the truth. Well, gather around! From the boss. Take care of your job! Koheiji! There will be only the two of us. Huh? What happened to Kumataro? He betrayed the boss. Huh?! When did you return? You look like you saw a ghost. You were right about Monjiro. Boss... Am I in your way? What? I asked you to take care of Monjiro. I did not ask you to kill me. It must be some mistake. Why would I kill you? You are hiding something from me. What is it? About my father... Why now? I thought you heard everything from your uncle, Hachibei. All I heard was that the killer must be Monjiro. That's all. Five years ago, I was there when Boss Jubei was saying goodbye to Monjiro. Monjiro, Kamieda and your hometown Mikazuki village, are coincidentally so close. Please visit anytime. Oh, I have a favour to ask you. I will walk with you a little. Hey, Hachibei, get me 10 ryo from the safe. Yes. Please take these. Boss Jubei went out with the 10 ryo and Monjiro. Then after a few hours, the bad news came to Hachibei. Brother! The 10 ryo were gone, too. That was condolence money for Boss Buemon of Oiwake's wife. After that, Monjiro killed Hachibei who tried to avenge his brother. At Nojiri Hill. You know more about that than I. Omachi, you will be my wife. That is your mother's wish. No, it is my desire. Boss! Your mother! Huh? Mother! She was a tough but precious mother to me. What do you need? Go away! No matter what you say, we are not going to join the riot. You should know some farmers don't want to work with the Gorozo family. Are you here to get more people? Oh, police! They don't need to run away. I just want my horse to drink water. They are all nervous about the new tax. A huge amount of money is moving behind closed doors. Did you come here for money? I'm just passing by. There will be a big riot. I am waiting to see what will happen. Why don't you work for me and make a big profit? It's nothing to do with me. Good day. What a selfless guy he is... How do you do? From Joshu, Nittagori, Mikazuki village. I am Monjiro of the "Cold Wintry Wind." At this moment, I'm on the road and do not belong to any family. Pardon my short introduction. Today, I'm here to ask you for a favour. Kindly ask Boss Gorozo if I can see Benten no Koheiji. Please rise up. Thank you. Unfortunately, the boss is not able to see you right now. His mother just passed away. Hope you understand. I see. What a bold man he is. Huh? Really? Boss Gorozo is using you for his greedy plot. Shit! I heard everything from Tasuke. He was gathering men for Boss Gorozo, but after he discovered his evil plot, he is opposing him. Yes, that's right. Before, we were doing well under Boss Jubei, but after the Gorozo family took over... What crap! I worked hard, believing in my boss. Did you finally wake up? Now go back to Kiso as Monjiro told you to. I can't go back like this! What are you going to do? You'll be in trouble! I will talk to the boss face to face. Koheiji! Where is the boss? He is out. Koheiji, why are you upset? I was tricked! I'm not going to lead the riot for greedy money! Well, well some farmers told you a false story. Omachi told me! Omachi? She was joking with you. Koheiji, I don't know what you're talking about, but just take it easy. That's right. Let's go for a drink and talk. Monjiro? Nice to see you again. I want to speak with you in private. What is it? Please let Benten no Koheiji go back to Kiso. Koheiji? What is Koheiji to you? My life was saved by Koheiji's father. I see. That's how you returned from death However, I can't do that. As you know, once we become "Oyabun/Kobun" our bond is stronger than blood. Once he has taken an oath from me, he cannot leave. That's how we live by the Gambler's Code. Then I wonder... What? If you are really following our Code to put blame on your own family member, and to make him a scapegoat for your own greed. What did you just say? Monjiro, what do you want from me? Some people never learn and do the same things over and over again. Stealing what you want without getting your hands dirty. I'm talking about five years ago. What are you talking about? You're the thief who killed Boss Jubei for money. This is the receipt for the 10 ryo I delivered five years ago. You can't make me the thief. So, who is the real thief... Shut up! Hey! Gorozo, are you going to disrespect your mother's mourning period by shedding blood? All I want is Koheiji, then I'll leave in peace. Have you seen Koheiji? He left with Toranosuke. To where? Omachi, what did you say to Koheiji? I don't know... Don't lie. Boss is waiting. Leave me alone! Shit! Monjiro! Monjiro! Koheiji is in danger! Tell me. Where is Koheiji? What is this? Why are we here? I'm going back! Oh, what a terrible thing they've done. He is still alive. He could have been eaten by wild dogs if not found. Oh, the Hasshu Official! Listen carefully! There will be no extra tax! - What?! - What?! Go home now! If you do now, there will be no punishment! He is okay now. You are very lucky. I really wanted to be a man! What a loser I am... Are you still talking about that? You are still young. Being a outlaw is not the only way to be a real man. Father... Otami... I want to see them so badly... Where is your family? Yes. I sent them away to my wife's village in Shinshu to protect them. Finally, I understand. Everything was Gorozo's plot. Now I remember what my father said... Omachi, there is someone who wants me dead in order to take over the Kamieda village. That's why... on the outskirts... of Kamieda village... Boss Jubei! Oh, Gorozo. Put the blame on Monjiro, and send Hachibei to avenge his brother. Gorozo wanted both of them dead. I'm so sorry... Hey, Kogarashi Monjiro! I'm Hachibei of the Kamieda family. When Hachibei tried to kill you, there was a young man. Yes. That young man pushed both of you off of the cliff. Attack from the side! Hurry up! The truth is-- I knew it. Huh? How? The scent of camellia hair oil. The oil was the same one that my late elder sister used to use. That scent was you, Omachi. Hachibei and I were deceived. Please, forgive us. It's all in the past. No need to apologize. But now I finally find closure for the incident. I came here to bring back Koheiji, and ended up solving the mystery of what happened five years ago. What? Are you going to see the Gorozo family? They are already here. Huh? Omachi, go upstairs. What are you doing? Let me go! Don't let him go! Gorozo! It seems like the end of the world. Fortune teller... After the new year, there will be a tremendous disaster in Joshu and Shinshu... "MO" Omachi, please take care of Koheiji. Monjiro? Where are you going? I don't think I can live a straight life. The shogunate did not impose the extra tax out of fear of angering the farmers. Well well, please have a drink since I opened my special saké cellar! There will be no extra tax without paying any effort! There is nothing to complain about! What can I say! This is all because of your efforts, please have some more! Life is give and take. Another lucky thing is the annoying Gorozo got killed by some drifter. So you have not spent any money... Except on you, Asaka. That was but a tiny fraction of your profit. Anyway, a happy ending! I wonder... who... that drifter was... "Cold Wind" Monjiro. From Joshu Nittagori, Mikazuki Village. Born to a poor peasant family. He left his home when he was ten. He heard his family is gone. He is alone in this world. Nobody knows how he became who he is.
