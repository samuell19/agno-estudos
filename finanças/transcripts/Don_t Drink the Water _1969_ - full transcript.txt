Do you have the tickets, Walter? Passports, medical certificates? Imagine, we're actually on our way to Europe. I'm so glad my brother insisted we make this trip. We really should do something for him. I'd like to rap him right in the shoot. It's 5:10 now. Ergo, your watch should be set ahead to 10:10. I'll write to you. I also suggest a sleeping pill the first few nights. Normally, I would say that this is a no-no, but in this circumstance, it seemsustified. Keep the faith, Donald. I hear Athens is lovely. - I can't wait to see the ruins. - You like ruins? Take a look at my business when we get back. Your partner'sust as good a caterer as you are. Sam's aerk. He's supposed to be here. Walter! Walter! Where the hell have you been, Sam? You said to meet you at the check-in counter. That's downstairs. This is the boarding area! Only an idiot could think that this is the check-in counter! Walter, please. We have lots to discuss. Wait till I check in. Flight 26 now boarding at gate 9. Oh! Harold! Surprise, surprise! Walter, say hello to Harold. Hel-lo. I envy you, Walter. I'll sell you my ticket. Yes, sir, Mr. hollander, party of three. You sure you'll be back by the 20th? We got the millman wedding to cater, you know. I'm not gonna blow an $8,000ob. - I'll be back in plenty of time. - Thank you, Mr. hollander. Now, where do I go? The bridegroom... He's a space engineer. I'm already on top of that. I'm working on a special centerpiece for it. Now, I'm going to start out by making a rocket ship out of celery. I'm going to have a little pimento space capsule, you know, and it's all gonna be resting on a launch pad made out of chopped chicken liver. Gorgeous. Well, they don't call me the potato salad Picasso for nothing. While you're gone, we got the rendazo anniversary. Oh, yes. That's the meatball Cuban. It's in the freezer. I had that for the hogan wedding. Hogan's the Navy lieutenant. That's the sausage gunboat. I had that for the bernsteins. Sausage for the bernsteins? Oh, yeah. “Oh, yeah.” Flight 26 for London. That's us! Good-bye, Harold. Don't make any mistakes. And don't buy anything for that millman wedding. And don't get any grapefruit. Good-bye, Donald. We got five sacks of them in the basement. And use those crab cakes first. So long, Walter. Don't forget the 20th. What are you waving for, you nut? You got my bag. Let's not argue. Telephone Tel Aviv tell 'em there's a DC leaving from New York & hold the pork & be sure it's “yet, oh, don't forget & see if camp 90-90 will let & ourunior in he'll meet a friend family plan all the way and I heard the agent say “you'd better watch your daughter “and don't drink the water Athens won't be the same what's the name of that good book & jonp'sand q's js what-to-dos?

I'm gonna have a nut. How can you eat that garbage? London, Paris, Rome, and now Athens. You're going to love Athens, Walter. First time I agree with you. The next stop is Newark. Listen to this. “The Parthenon, where civilization actually began, the ruins.” Even your father will get something out of Greece. Four more days of uninterrupted diarrhea. I'm not complaining. I'll be back in time for the millman wedding, and that's all I care about. And I'm sure that with my excellent record here as United States ambassador to Bulgaria, the party will insist I run for governor. And you'll make a great governor, dad. Your broad outlook will appeal to psychotic liberals as well as militant fascists... Something for everybody. Very funny. But I'm still very worried about leaving you here in charge of the embassy while I'm in Washington. You... you do remember my instructions, Axel? Yes, sir. I'm not to leave the house, and don't open the door to strangers. Of course, you realize that if anything goes wrong here, it would ruin my chance to be governor. No problem, dad. Smetena's a quiet little outpost. What can possibly happen in two weeks? You were in Panama for only two weeks, and they hung you in effigy. Well, it happens. By your own embassy? And how about Berlin? Oh, yes, then there was Berlin. To my knowledge, you are the only man in the history of the foreign service ever to wrap his lunch in a peace treaty. Still, it would have been nice when vice president agnew dropped by if somebody had recognized him. Yeah, but, dad, nobody recognizes him in America, either. - Kilroy? - Yes, sir? For the next two weeks, will you please give Axel your full cooperation? Don't worry, sir. I'll be at his elbow at all times. Axel, the only visitor you might have would be the sultan of bashir. - Sultan of bapir. - Bashir. - Bashir. - Bashir. Yeah. If he should show up before I get back, give him anything he wants, anything. "We've got a very big oil deal cooking. Well, uh, have a good trip, sir. Happy landings, and don't worry about a thing, governor. Heh. “On your arrival, “you will be greeted with a mandolin serenade "by peasants garbed in their colorful short skirts." I think theyust lowered their hemlines. If those are mandolins they're carrying, I hope they don't start to play 'em. This is your captain speaking. We've been forced to make an unscheduled landing. This is smetena airport in Bulgaria. We're awaiting clearance and should be departing for Athens in approximately... 30 minutes. Hey, pal. What's going on? We've been hijacked. We're behind the iron curtain. Bulgaria. Beautiful. The iron curtain. An adventure. Passengers may leave the plane if they wish but must remain in the immediate area. Let's go, Walter. Out there? Not this apple. I'm staying right here. Aw, come on, daddy, last chance to see an enslaved nation before the tourists take over. Walter, ust one picture so we can show everyone we were here. Please, darling, ust for me. All right, in honor of Newark. But, comrade krojack, I had no choice! I knew I had to get out of the U.S. quickly when I heard the Americans had captured lopert. - There so you can get in the picture. - Will you stand still? I'm gonna get pneumonia. - But get the barbed wire. - Building in, too. Lopert. The gray fox. Our best agent is captured, and this is what escapes. Are you sure of that? They got him, all right. Could you stand over here? You? Will you hurry up, Marion? I've... Who are those people there? I don't know. Get your men, stupid! Did you wind it, dear? Of course I got it wound up. Stop! Filthy spies! Stop! Stop! We shoot! Come on! Come on! Americans! Apple pie! The Brooklyn Dodgers! She means Los Angeles. - Open the door! - Yeah, quick. Get in! Get in! Get in! Kilroy. Aah! They're gonna... aah! Quick. Now, let's see. I'll need a few facts. I'm Axel magee of the United States embassy, and that is Mr. kilroy at the wheel. Mr. and Mrs. Walter hollander, Newark, Newersey, and this is our daughter, Susan. She was a cesarean. I assume you'll be seeking asylum. I will not be seeking asylum. I didn't do anything wrong! I'm a caterer fromersey. I'll need your passports and some information. Now... have either of you ever had respiratory ailments... Oh. That's the wrong form. “Let's go to Miami, “ I said. “No, let's go to Europe, “ you said. “We can do things in Europe we couldn't do in Miami.“ you were right. We're going to a Europeanail! Oh, nothing like that, sir. I'm sure once we have the information... Now, have you ever bought anything on credit? The information is very simple. We came on this trip... Well, it was mainly my brother Harold's idea. May he rest in peace. He's not dead. He will be when I get a hold of him. This is crazy. My wife shouldn't have to go through this! She's not a young woman! Well, it's not much further now, sir. I'm an old woman? I don't mean old. I mean, you know, young old. Aah! They're shooting at us! What do you mean, young old? I can still fit into the dress I was married in. Can you? I think they're only overreacting. Look out! Should we go back? We're leaving the scene of an accident. We could get into trouble. I don't see the truck anymore. Well, I hope nothing happened to them. Hand over those spies. They're not spies. I asked them. I'll give you a carbon copy of the report. They are spies. They were in a secret area taking pictures. Pictures of what? Pictures of our fighter planes, stupid, the supersonic... Get out of here. It's a secret. I can't tell you. Hand them over. We'll drag them out and shoot them. Now... now, look. Look. This embassy is United States territory. Nobody can be dragged out of here and shot without the written consent of the American government. Will you leave me alone? My government will take steps. Well, so will mine... Great big steps, too. Then we will surround the building, and no one will leave! No one! Who's this big mouth? No one! There's some magazines here. Have you had lunch? Hey, they're really setting machine guns out there! First, no movie on the plane, and now this. Well, what are you gonna do about it? We will lodge a formal complaint. Yes, we will lodge a formal complaint. What are you, his echo? Uh, daddy? It's a simple misunderstanding, sir. How simple? Huh. We leave the building, we get killed. Is that simple enough? Oh, no, no. Nothing like that, sir. There'd be a trial first. I take my family on a vacation, I want to show them a nice time, and we got this working for our government. And they wonder why I don't vote. Mr. magee, uh, this formal complaint, will it take very long? - The what? - Formal... Oh, the complaint. Yeah... no. I'll get on it right away. Well, if I can be of any assistance to you, offer any information, I'm at your disposal. Oh, good, good. Well, I'll... I'll call in here from the ambassador's office. Well, are you satisfied? Are you satisfied? We could be in a cabana in Miami beach right now! Every year, it has to be Miami beach. What's the matter? They need you to work the tide? They need him to work the tide in Miami beach. - Bless you. - Thank you. Government... Conservation, communication... Cultural affairs. Cultural affairs. That wouldn't be it, would it? No. They've got to have a foreign office. Ah. Foreign office, yeah. Yeah, that... that might do it. Foreign office. It's best to go right to the top in these things. Foreign office? Yes, this is Axel magee, acting ambassador of the United States, the most powerful nation on earth, and it... what? Oh. Oh, all right. Yes, I'll... I'll hold on. They're gonna check on it. Do you think they'll hold the plane for us? Oh! Wait. Ah... This is Axel magee, acting ambassador of the United States, the most pow... what? The United States. U-n-i-t... E... e.. You know I'm not the kind of a guy to throw up anything in your face, but... if you remember, you were the one that wanted to take the picture. And I said, “Marion, it looks like restricted property to me.“ and you said, “why? “Because there are guards, guns, and barbed wire?" And I said, “yes. “Because there are guards, guns, and barbed wire.” Now, this is what I want to ask you. Did you think it was a place that sold guards, guns, and barbed wire? Yeah, United States of America. Of America. O.-f. America. A... capital a-m... Big "a." Capital. Big 'a." A-m-e-r... Well, what do they say? The regular girl in the complaint office is on vacation. - She's having a baby. - Ah. Would you see if you can, you know... I'll handle it. Why don't weust give them the camera? Wait a minute! Th... that's a good idea, Mr. hollander. There's nothing on the film, is there? Oh, that I can guarantee. The last reel, he held the camera backwards... 50 feet of super-8 film of his right eyeball. I'm not giving this camera to anybody. It cost me 95 clams. Always money. You know, that's why they don't like us in Europe... Always flaunting our wealth. Mr. hollander, I think this will settle things very quickly. Excuse me. Sorry. Is he the most beautiful thing in the world? Well, he's only trying to help us. Help us? By giving my stuff away? Is that we got an ambassador for, to play “queen for a day”? Bumping, knocking... he's a nut. Mr. krojack. Mr. krojack! Mr. krojack, here. Here. Come on... here. You canudge for yourself. Believe me, they are not spies. They are American tourists. Did you see the shirt that guy was wearing? They're spies. Go ahead, develop the film. It's nothing but noses. Anyhow, they have committed a criminal act. Come on, now. Why all the fuss? You spy on us, we spy on you. Everybody knows it. Why do we have to pretend it's so unusual? Ooh. You admit you spy. Tell me, how often? All the time. It's no secret. Espionage goes on between our countries every day. Then those people are spies. Well, what difference does it make? Are you gonna tell me that you don't send spies into our country posed as American tourists? But you do admit they are spies? Well, what if they are? What if they are? That still doesn't give you the right to enter these grounds illegally. Is that better? I'm telling you, you're gonna get yourself into big trouble. Every nation on this earth will recognize this as a cruel and vicious attack. I wouldn't even be surprised if France took our side. Iust talked to your office. They want you to return immediately. Hmm. He admitted they are spies. Mr. magee, you didn't! Well... And... and I have it all recorded right there. Well, I... I... I suppose I did in a sense. But you know we spy. They spy... We do nothing of the sort! Actually, we do. Now, look. If we would all stop being hypocritical and be honest for once... Mr. magee... Look. How can the truth hurt? The fact is, we do spy. Louder, please, and talk into the button. Don't you twist my words. You're the one at fault here. You come here with your soldiers and your guns, and then you wonder why a brutal dictatorship gets a bad name. Now, I'm gonna count to three... Don't bother. I'm going. I have what I want in the little button. Now, the soldiers will stay here. And about those spies, don't worry. They can either come out here or stay in there the rest of their lives. This is great. ust dandy. Those lunatics out there say we're spies, and this lunatic says yes. Why did you do it? I panicked. I lost control. But what were you thinking? I was thinking, “don't panic. Don't lose control.” 27 years, I've been a caterer. Built up a business, reputation. Creative catering. I was the first one in Newark to make bridegrooms out of pot cheese. He does lovely work, I'll say that for him. That's not good enough for you. You got to make me a spy. Look. I'm sorry, Mr. hollander. I was really only trying to calm them down. Mr. hollander? There's no Mr. hollander. That'sust a cover name. I'm really the Batman. I'm a celery stuffer by day and a secret agent at night. I hide microfilm, sneak across the border, give enemy agents an old karate chop. What's with you? Tuesdays, you have been coming home late. That's my bowling night! Now you got her believing it. Obviously, everybody's been overreacting. I'm sure when things start settling down... The only thing that's gonna settle down is that army out there. We're liable to be here three or four days. I'll... I'll... I'll see about dinner. I'm coming down with something. I think is all great! - You do? - Yeah. You know, it can be fun. Some people might look upon this as an exciting experience. Some people bought edsels. Well, we could be a lot worse off. This place is beautiful. Iust can't hang around here. The millman wedding is coming up, and Sam can't handle it. Sam is my husband's partner. I think you'd like him. Oh, you'd love him. He's a mental midget, too. I'm telling you, Sam can't handle that affair. All right, so he can have his son come and help out. He's over 21. His son? Who's going to dress him? Well, we might as well make the best of it. I've got another bomb for you. What about Seth? Seth? Oh, my god! Forgive her. She can't remember she gave birth twice. Seth is at camp. Yes, and camp closes Tuesday. What's gonna happen to him when we're not home to let him in? He'll be unsupervised. He'll live in the street and run amok. He'll loot and rape. You know what our son is like... Just like your brother. Daddy. Well, what about you? You know, Donald isn't gonna like this. Donald? Her fiance, a very nice lawyer with asthma, but he couldn't come with us. You know what I feel like doing? I feel like going right out there... Chichikov. Chichikov. Chichikov. Chichikov! Chichikov! Have you seen chichikov? No, no. This is father drobney. Father, these are the hollanders. My children. Chichikov is his rabbit. Have you seen him? I don't think so. Damn! Oh! Sorry. Father, the hollanders came in today very much the same way as you did. Are you refugees? Refugees? Do you know what I paid for this shirt? We were at the Vatican. We know your boss. Have you been here long? Well, father drobney's case is quite different from yours. Yes. I... am a guest of your government. See, I try not to make myself a nuisance. I have a little room on the top floor which I practically never leave. But how long have you... Listen. Why don't we all wash up? We'll have a little dinner. Maybe we can listen to some propaganda broadcasts. Wait a minute. How long have you been here? Well, as I say, father's case is quite different. How long? A day? A week? A month? How long? It's been closer to... Six years. Six years. Uh... do you still get paid? Have you ever tried to escape? My duty is to remain here and someday lead my people once again. But until you lead your people, you stay in your bedroom? It hasn't been bad. I, uh, practice my hobby, magic tricks. That's why he has the rabbit. Pick a card. Pick a card, any card. Go ahead, I'm not fussy. Oh, come on, daddy, pick a card. Pick. Pick. Jack of spades! 4 of clubs. Damn! I know. That's two. Father also raises white doves. Doves. White doves. I, uh... transform them before your very eyes. Oh, I'd love to see your birds. An audience! I'll do the rings. Magic production! Hey! Magic! Don't go away. “Don't go away.” “Dear son, I miss you very much. “Take care of yourself, eat slowly, “chew your food carefully, and go to bed early. “Above all, stay away from women. “See what happened to me.” I've waxed every floor in this house today twice. You ought to stick to your dusting. Too much wax can be dangerous. Huh! Don't you think I know what I'm doing? Goddamn floors. I told you. I know how to wax. He doesn't know how to walk. Yes. Good. Comrade krojack will be with you inust a moment. I have ambassador magee for you in Washington. - Ah, Mr. amb... - Excuse me. Comrade krojack, would you ask him how the market went today? Market? What market? The wall street. I got some mutual funds, couple shares IBM. Also, ask if the government is going through with the antitrust thing. Excuse me, Mr. ambassador. Break his legs! Comrade krojack here. I had a talk with your son. Yes, a bright boy. Would you like to hear his remarks? You spy on us, we spy on you. Everybody knows it. Why do we have to pretend it's so unusual? Ooh. You do admit you spy? How often? All the time. It's no secret. Espionage goes on between our countries every day. But you do admit they are spies? Well, what if they are? What if they are? What's the difference? Are you gonna tell me that your country doesn't send spies into the United States? So those people are spies. That's about all, Barney. Stay well, and give our best to your aunt and uncle. Bye-bye. Boy, are we lucky not to be home. It's pouring in Newark. What a thrill. That was Barney brakestone. I told him we were all right. Did you also tell him not to meet us at the airport in the station wagon because we might be six years late? Hey, Axel. Yes, sir? Hear anything yet? Ah, no, sir, not yet, but I'm sure once they get the film developed. Well, what's taking so long? You're in a communist country. Maybe they don't have all-night drugstores. One thing, Mrs. hollander. Naturally, you're free to use the phone, but if you could limit your phone calls toust a few dozen. When Nixon gets his phone bill, he may have to cancel the space program. Excuse me. Did I tell you I got the kleins? They're going to look after Seth till we get back. That's the worst couple you could have got. Why? What's wrong with the kleins? They have orgies. How do you know? I catered one. I've been a chef... You know who you should be cooking for? Castro. But I run a million-dollar catering business in Newark. L... don't threaten me, you clam. All right. What... What's the problem? Mr. hollander is the problem. I'm trying to prepare dinner. Every dish I name, he wants something else. Yeah, well, I think if Mr. hollander requests something, you should try... Mr. magee, we are in a communist country, 6,000 miles from the United States. Where do you expect me to find a celery cheesecake? What did you have planned? - Oysters. - I don't eat oysters. You have to eat them alive. I like my food dead... Not sick, not wounded... dead. How do you live with this man? Do you force-feed him? I know what he likes. I'llust fix him a chicken. Do you have a double boiler? No, no, no. No one is allowed in my kitchen. No, no. No, you'll get all my knives mixed up. No! Nice to know our food is being prepared by an outpatient. We must be missing something. Must be missing something. We must be missing something! - Comrade krojack! - What is it? I have some information. Turn it off. Lights! This notebook, it was found at airport at exact spot where spies were taking pictures. Isn't that nice? A magic showust for us. I wish I had some popcorn. How about a pizza? I am ready now. A real showstopper. I produce two white doves from the thin air. If you will watch closely, please. I didn't say it. If it's for me, I'm free to talk. Hello. Yes. Yes, this is Axel magee. It's the secret police. Now, they're probably calling to say you're free to go. Tell me, your spies, they are comfortable? Yes, thank you very much. Our spies are very comfortable. Excellent. Would you ask the head spy, please... the fat one... If he lost a notebook at the airport? Did you lose a notebook at the airport? Ah, yeah, yeah. I had my notes in it about the millman wedding. Look. Ask him if I could get it back right away. I need it. Yes, he did, and he's very anxious to get it back. He needs it. I'm sure he does, but I'm afraid we need it, too, for a little while longer. We almost have it broken. That's right, the code. Troop movements, weapons, supply information. I'll-I'll ask him. He says it's a code for troop movements. Hello? Uh, that doesn't have anything to do with troop movements. That's the millman and klinger wedding. And there are more millmans than there are klingers because the millmans are paying for the wedding. They may eat like an army, but they're all civilians. Oh, of course. And this drawing of a rocket, I see it's only a decoration for a wedding. Strange, isn't it, that it happens to be an exact drawing of one of our spaceships? What do you say to that? I say I feel sorry for your astronauts because they're going to the moon in tomato aspic! Amusing. And I suppose this gunboat you sketched is also made of tomato aspic. Of course not! The gunboat's made out of sausage! Enough of this. The evidence is quite clear. You will pay for your treachery. We are a young country. We have plenty of time. We will wait you out until we get our revenge. Remember, the ideology of the masses will triumph. Dirty, rotten... Yep, guess we don't leave. Well, why can't we leave? Because it would be impolite. We're guests of honor of that firing squad out there! No one will harm you, sir. You are a citizen of the United States, the most powerful nation on this earth. Have that put on my stone. Now... If you will watch closely, please. - I will take... - I'm getting out of here. Guns or no guns, I'm going back to America! - Daddy! - Wait! Mr. hollander. Where's my hat? Mr. hollander, I really don't think this is wise. Shut up. Where's my hat? Look, sir. I planned on calling my father in Washington. I'm sure he's gonna have an answer to this whole situation. Don't do me any favors. I can't hang around here six years. I got a business to run back home! Maybe! Where's my hat? But, daddy, they still think we're spies! All right, let them catch me. They'll find out I'm a caterer. They want any information, I'll tell them how to slice grapefruit. There's my hat. Mr. hollander, now, look. You're very upset. Now, please, why don't you get a good night's sleep? And I'll call my father. We'll settle the whole thing. Do you know whose fault this is”? This is your fault because this whole thing was your idea. Mr. hollander, please reconsider. Let him go. Well, go on, Humphrey bogart! Go, go. There's the door. You think I won't? You think I'm afraid of those guys out there? Oh, why should you be afraid? They'll only arrest you and torture you. What's to be afraid of? Just bite down hard on your cyanide capsule. Go on, dear. Stop trying to stop me. Go on! Get brainwashed. In your case, it'll probably help. Tee hee. You're letting in a draft. Call your father. Do you have a girlfriend back home? Well, there was this girl I was writing to, but she lost interest. How do you know? Well, for one thing, she stopped writing. That doesn't mean the end. She also got married and pregnant, and I'm not sure in which order. That means something. What's he like, Donald? I mean, the only thing I know about him is that he's a lawyer with a sinus condition. - Asthma. - Oh, that's right. Donald knows about everything, like whether you should set your clock ahead or back five hours when you go to Europe. Which is it? You really don't know, do you? No, no. No, I'm not sure. Sam? Sam, can you hear me? Operator! Operator, you cut my party off! Well, get him back for me, right away! Walter, stop shouting. You'll aggravate your cold. They can hear you outside. You're frightening the soldiers. My partner, Sam Blackwell, he caters a sweet 16 party. I don't want to hear. He gets a special price on the meat. I'm not interested! Does he go to our regular butcher? No, not Sam. He's trying to buy cheap. I'm not listening. Six people go home that night, and what happens? They get food poisoning. They're in the hospital because he's looking for bargains. Oh, my god, I bet they're suing. Oh, now you're interested. Are they? I'm not telling you. You're not interested. Tell me. J' a foggy day in London town & Walter, you know what you are? A sadist. Why? A minute ago, you weren't interested! - I'm not interested! - Good! A foggy day in London... well, are you gonna tell me? Are you asking if they're gonna sue us? No, they're not gonna sue us. We're gonna sue them... For low resistance to tainted meat. - Walter. - Of course they're gonna sue us! What do you expect from poisoned people? Be thankful nobody died. Yes, Marion. We may make that our slogan. Hello. Hello, Sam. How are the children? Let me have it. Let me have it. Hello, Sam. Sam, I want you to hear this. I'm coming home, Sam, and when I get back, I'm gonna rent a car, and I'm gonna run you over! Run you right over! You're through in the catering business, Sam. You're finished! You've chopped your last liver! Look what I found. A little wine, monsieur? They're your pajama tops, silly. Yeah, but I've never seen them quite like that, just fluffed, dried, and folded. Oh, thank you. Thank you very much. Why don't you sit down? Uh... ok. Oh, sorry. Sorry. How did your father sound on the phone? Oh, same as usual... halfway between bleak despair and outright hysteria. Well, obviously, I failed him again. He said he'd work something out and call me back. But it isn't easy being the son of a superdad. A super... oh, no. No. When I was... When I wasust a little boy, just a little... a little kid, and I did something wrong, my mother used to hit me with a copy of time magazine... With my father's picture on the cover. Every day I read the newspaper, I read about another diplomatic foul-up somewhere. L... well, I haven't minded much before. I mean, my failures were only hurting me. But this time, I'm contaminating your father's business, your mother's vacation... And there's Donald. Your... Your, uh, family... oh, sorry. Sorry. Your family seems to like him. I guess you never really know what you want. You know, you think you're looking for a certain type, and... Then, all of a sudden, something happens, and... Are those guys still out there? The... oh. Y-you mean, the soldiers? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I guess so. Why? Danger really turns me on. Do you know how many babies were born out of the blitz in england? What's that? Well, it's... well, you know, just an ordinary secret passageway. Well, this... this mansion was built by a Duke or something, a man of rather large sexual appetite. Well, this was his bedroom, and this led down towards his m... His girlfriend's. Oh! Isn't that my bedroom down there? Oh. Now... now look. I didn't assign you that room because I... Oh, Axel, this I've got to see. Too much! Oh! That Duke was a freak! Yeah. They say he used to make her dress up likeuliet. Then he'd come through the wall dressed up like, uh, Romeo, and he'd chase her around the room, swatting her with his mandolin. I don't dig weird sexual bags, do you? No, no. My, uh, sexual bag is quite traditional. You might even call it obsolete. Sex is great naturally. Maybe you'veust never swung with the right partner. Susan, you all right in there? - Susan? - Ust fine. Be there in a second, daddy. Axel, get out of here. Susan! Susan! Coming, daddy. Susan! I can't move it. I can't move it. Susan... Listen, everyone. - Good news! Good news! - What is it? Iust spoke with ambassador magee. He's arranged for your release. - Where's Axel? - How did he do it? Hey. What are you... You're being exchanged for a communist agent, the gray fox. - The gray fox? - Oh, it's typical. Every time we arrest one of their spies, they arrest one of our caterers. They're sending a plane in for you tomorrow noon. Wonderful! Hey, your old man must be quite a guy. Just think! We'll get our suitcases. I can change out of these shoes. We're going home. We're gonna get out of here at last. Only for the gray fox would my government do this. I had plans for you. In one hour, you would have told me everything. The radio operatorust received an urgent message from Washington. The gray fox is dead. Dead? Dead. Why don't you admit that you're a filthy American spy? Why don't you play in the runway? He hung himself. He hung him... Shh! Krojack will be getting word any minute. Admit it. If it makes you happy, I admit it. I'm not fromersey, I'm not a caterer, and she's not my wife. She's a u-boat commander. And then he's gonna grab the hollanders. Uh, look, we got to get back to the embassy fast. I'd like to break you in two pieces. Don't try anything, buster. We're all black belts in karate. Hey, oh, whoa! I'd kill you with my bare hands. Don't move, or I'll blow you to pieces. You're bluffing. Try me, hotshot. That's a finger. It only looks like a finger. It happens to be a flesh-colored .45 with two knuckles, aoint, and a little hair. Mr. hollander, your wife would like to see you. You will pay for your little game. How? Are you forgetting the gray fox? Who's he trying to kid? Someday, I will have my chance. Your cockamamie threats don't frighten me. The gray fox is dead. I've got you over a barrel, and you know it. Dead? We... we got to get back to the embassy. Well, it was nice talking to you. Nut of a gray fox has to pick today to hang himself! If I could get my hands on him, I'd kill him! I'd better call Barney brakestone. You better call Seth, too. Tell him to go ahead with his applications to the foster parents' home. What makes a man want to kill himself? What do you expect from the gray fox? Is that a name for a grown-up person? Hey! At least he's dressed properly. Excuse me. Could someone help me out of this, please? Don't pay any attention to him. I think it's marvelous a man of the cloth has a hobby besidesust god. Hello? Yes, operator. Fine. Sam Blackwell's calling. Ask him if it's still raining. Hello, murderer. Have you poisoned anybody lately? Oh, Walter, be nice. We all make mistakes. No. I'm not still here. I'm in Puerto Rico. I'm having a mintulep underneath a palm tree. Of course I'm still here! Who do you think is talking to you? What?! Two more keeled over? They're dropping like flies? What do you mean you can't talk anymore? Their lawyersust walked in? Goodbye, Sam. He's wiped half of Newark county. Have faith in the lord, my son. I have faith, father, and if he's listening now, please crush Sam Blackwell's head. Well, if I'm through as a caterer, I don't have to worry. Iust found a new business. I'm going to apply for the straitjacket concession in this madhouse. What are you doing with the stove? - Stove? - Yes, a porcelain stove. You don't think Bulgaria has central heating. I've been mailing letters in it. No wonder I didn't get any answers. Walter. She's kissing a failure. Well, it's her life. All of a sudden, it's goodbye to a successful lawyer and hello to a psychotic diplomat. It's not up to us, is it? I know that, Marion. All I want is the right thing for her. Well, what is the right thing for her? What I tell her is the right thing for her, that's what. Get away. Susan! Come up here and stop that funny stuff! He sounds angry. I'd prefer her to go with that draft dodger. At least he was a success. He beat the draft. Had toump off the roof to do it, but he beat it! Oh, listen, Susan. I had an idea. Now, the sultan of bashir is coming here today. - Sultan? - Yeah. The sultan of bashir. He's a very influential man. Now, I can ask him to intercede with the police for your release. Wonderful. Dad will love that. Yeah. Ok. Would you tell him? I got to go and change into something more formal. Oh, welcome, your majesty. Welcome indeed. Won't you step into the ambassador's office? I'll get Mr. magee immediately. And sit! Who's that... Lawrence of Arabia? How do you do, sultan? Sultan? How do you know him? Are you ignorant? It's the sultan of bashir. What do you do, hang around the un. Building? I saw his picture in playboy. I am here to see ambassador magee. Won't you have a chair? Can I take your sheet? I hope you didn't have trouble with the police getting in. They wouldn't dare. That's great. This clown's running around in an awning in and out of our embassy. I'm a citizen, and I'm stuck here. Daddy, listen. I, uh... oh. This is my daughter Susan. She graduated third in her class. Well, charming. You know, I am thinking of adding an American girl to my harem. Adding? What do you mean adding? Marriage, of course. You see, I'm a man of few words. I happen to be a man of few words, too... Drop dead. No one speaks to me like that! No one! Listen, you sand clam! Your highness, Mr. magee will be... I demand a formal apology from your government! - You'll have it. - Who do you think you are? A big shot because you own some oil Wells or something? You're nothing but a cockamamie nut! Please, Mr. hollander, please go! Me go? Let him go. I pay taxes for this place! Did you fill out a 1040 form last year? Mr. hollander, we have business! Who is this person? Iust happen to be a little Mr. nobody from Newark, Newersey, but I don't like the idea of my government doing business with sex maniacs! You may consider relationship with us at an end! But, your highness! Good bye, fatso. Oh, boy. Well, at least things can't get any worse. Tonight, we have a spontaneous protest-demonstration-type deal. Follow the schedule exactly. At 7:00, all of those whose initials begin from “a " to “m," form in front of the American embassy right here with your posters. Show the posters. Now, make sure that the posters are facing the newsreel camera. 7:30, begin the chanting. There are three approved chants on top of page two, such as... “Down with the senseless, imperialist aggressors.“ see if the boys can punch that one up a little bit, please. All right. 8:00, your ranks will swell. Group “n " to “z" burning in effigy the American spy. This will be the effigy of the American spy. However, the Valiant police line will hold firm. This will only increase the righteous indignation of you students. You got that? Now, I want to see some raised fists and excitement out there for a change. This will in turn cause the police to overreact, make some arrests, and club one of the students into insensibility. We'll use punchy zwerken again. Where is he? There he is. Punchy, you think you got another one in you? All right. 8:30, start throwing rocks and sticks through the embassy windows. Did everybody remember to bring their rocks and sticks? Well, when you go home, remember to bring back your rocks and sticks! You can't make a protest like this. All right. Now I want to see some real good wall swarming tonight, and I don't want to see the soldiers helping to boost everybody over the fence the way they were doing on that British embassyob. If you can't swarm by yourself, you don't belong in this profession. Finally, the big payoff. Here I want to see 15 solid minutes of good running amok. I want to see some constructive vandalism tonight, something creative for a change. Then the police move in, restore order, everybody out. Any questions? No questions. All right. Mishkin, I want a word with you. You will do something for me. You will throw that in the embassy window. A bomb? They wouldn't have a chance. Has this been ok'ed by upstairs? Never mind upstairs. I ok, you throw. Right in the belly! 10, 20, 30, 39, 46. Here they come. Oh, it'sust another student demonstration. It's nothing. It doesn't bother me. Since I got my suitcase back, I'm a new woman. Will you please discard? I mean it. With comfortable shoes, I can face anything. Just play your card. We're only gonna be here six years, and I'd like to finish a game before we leave. Mr. kilroy doesn't seem very concerned. Yeah. Well, he hasn't had my experience. I know what it's like to be stoned and spit on, and believe me, those guys are stoners and spitters. Walter, come quick. They've got a cloth dummy that looksust like you, and they're burning it. And big, ugly signs calling us all kinds of names. Sticks and stones may break my bones, but names will never hurt me. Walter, they have sticks and stones! Look. I'm gonna call krojack, and I'm gonna protest. Burning in effigy? Running two minutes late. By the way, how did the chanting go? I mean, that's absolutely unthinkable! Burning in effigy! Unthinkable! Never fear. The police will handle it. See there? They're making arrests. I'd say it's practically all over now. Yeah, and I'd say we should be in the cellar. Nonsense! We're Americans! It's our duty to show them that we cannot be intimidated. - They're trying to hurt us! - Don't panic! Don't panic! Everybody remain calm. Now panic! What have you got in mind for next year, the gaza strip? What's this? It's an inkwell. What do you think it is? Don't yell at your only daughter, Walter. How could she know? She grew up on ballpoints. Let's go see the fun. Comrade krojack, you must stop mishkin and the bomb. Weust got a report on the spies. They're not spies. - Not spies? - Not spies. - Not spies? - Not spies. - Not spies? - Not spies. He is a caterer like he said. Completely innocent. - Positive? - Positive. What is the difference? We'll get them anyway. I think they've broken through the outer gates. But they won't get inside, will they? On my waxed floors? They better not. It sounds like it's all over. God bless the brutal secret police. Hey. What's this? Hold it! Careful. It's a bomb. Stop! Don't move. Don't put it down. Can I get up? Careful, easy. Take it. I'm sorry. I can't. The... the slightest jar of that thing, this whole place is gonna go sky-high. Walter, keep calm. Now I'm gonna try and dismantle it. I've had experience with these things. A lot of experience? Some. Now I'm gonna need a screwdriver. What size? Move your feet. Well, I brought these along. I heard about the plumbing over here. A... a medium. Small, small. I want everybody to leave the room. Kilroy, will you get... Will you get back here and take the ladies out? Well, let's go. You heard what he said. I can't move. I'm not allowed toar. Come, ladies. There's no sense in all of us being torn limb from limb. You go, Susan. I'm staying with your father. We came on the family plan. We'll go that way. Get out of here, Marion. You're making my thigh itch. Please, Mrs. hollander. Now go ahead, screwdrive. I sat with him through two weeks of the mumps. This couldn't be any worse. Stop trembling. Walter, don't hold that so close to your stomach. I think I'm going to belch. Dear, have a tummy. Would you hurry up? Would you, plea... Walter, be patient. I got to go to the bathroom. Would you hold this? It's disarmed. You can relax, sir. Are you quite sure that thing is completely safe? Completely safe. When it comes to bombs... I know exactly what I'm doing. Come in. - Hi. - Hi. Did you sleep all right? Naw. I was up most of the night just waiting for another explosion. Yeah. I know what you mean. If only my father were here. He'd know what to do. Axel, why couldn't we plan an escape? Axel, we can do it. Susan, you're nuts. I know we can do it! No. Ten minutes after you try to escape, I can picture krojack wearing your father's shirt. But they'll never catch us. Susan, look. An escape requires timing, coordination, and good physical condition. Your father gets out of breath if I ask him to pass the salt. Axel, for once, take the initiative. Don't let things happen to you. Susan. Together, we can do it. Wait a minute, Susan. Will you be reasonable? I'm with the foreign service, not the CIA. That's it. The CIA. Look. If you're talking about a escape, you're talking to the wrong guy. I don't escape. That's not my field. When I enter a place, I stay. You are a coward! That's what you are! You are a coward! Marion, have you ever seen a man with a hernia run from a tank? You want your daughter to get back to Donald, don't you? Bring on the CIA. I handle the local CIA around here. Go ahead, Mr. mirik. Well, I think we're gonna need identification for a party of three. Uh, let's see. We have... Three bandini” brothers, acrobats. Oh, here we go. Here we go. Mr. and Mrs. ohn Randall and son. Our son happens to be a girl. Walter, don't make trouble. Well, youust dress her like a boy. Ok. You are the Randall family now. Here's your passports. You have identification, all other pertinent information, you know, stuff like that there. Well, how do they get out of the embassy building? Well, I figured a perfect setup would be you'd throw a diplomats party in there tomorrow afternoon. Aha. Ok. I'll arrange that. Tomorrow afternoon? I'll have to start dusting right away. And when the guests start leaving, you slip out with them. We take it from there. Ok. I'll get the invitations out right away. - It soundsust perfect. - Right. Well, Mr. hollander? Now do you feel more secure about the United States government? Ahem. All right now. ust once more. Who are you? I'mohn Randall, I live in Washington, D.C., and I work for the department of the interior. I'm married, and I have 4 children. I was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. I went to school in California and majored in agriculture. I entered the government under Roosevelt. Who's gonna ask me these questions? Mr. hollander, if you're stopped, your answers must be consistent. Nobody's gonna believe I'm Sam Willard. John Randall. What are you doing in Europe? I'm making a tour. We're going all over Europe and see all the stuff. I'm on a tour. You can't wear the gray. You better wear the dark blue flannel. Blue is for parties. Gray here is for escaping. I'm wearing the gray. What are you doing in Europe? And I'm his lovely wife Carmen. I'm also the former miss Wisconsin of 1948. They believe that, we win the cold war. Where are you staying? The grand hotel for a week, and then we fly to Malaysia. Walter, I am telling you the blue suit. I'm wearing the gray. All right. You don't dress, I don't escape. My girdle's killing me. So is mine. Have you ever fired a pistol? A pistol? How often is there a gunfight in the catering business? It's really quite safe. It can't possibly fire unless you pull that trigger. Boy, that's a beauty. I don't think he should carry that gun. They're dangerous, and he doesn't know how to use one. I know how to use one. When did you ever use a gun? Plenty of times. Don't worry. When? I want to carry it. If he carries that gun, I don't go. Marion, why do you want to put a damper on everything? All right! All right! Take it, but if you're gonna kill yourself, don't come crying to me! All right, now. Look. The last step. What do you do when you leave here? Well... We get into the Randall car. The chauffeur takes us to the park, the CIA man meets us there. The password is “the grass is green.” Right, right. Ok. Ok. Now we'll meet in my room when it's time to go. Good luck. You dirty rat. The blue flannel. All set? People are starting to leave. It's time. - Where's Susan? - Well, I... Susan! My son! My god! Oh. The dirty... I think we're getting out of hereust in time. Well, y-you head for the office. He'll... uh, she'll follow. Remember, you're a boy. Act like one. Uh, Mr. magee. That's the state department for you. You know, Walter, I can tell you're carrying a gun. Never. There's a big bulge around your middle. That's the way I'm built. That's not the way you're built. You don't have a handle. Will you leave me alone? Walter, people are staring at your bulge. Foggy day in London town we haven't met, have we? Oh. I'mohn Randall. I'm from Washington, D.C. I work for the department of the interior. I'm married and have 4 children. I was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, went to school in California, majored in agriculture. I entered the government under the Roosevelt regime. My name isohn Randall. And I'm his lovely wife Carmen. - How do you do? - Charmed. Yasin kasnar here, and this is countess wilhelmina bordoni. Charmed. This wine is extraordinary. Have you tasted it? No, I haven't. Rather diffident and ethereal. Wouldn't you say so, Mr. Randall? Well, I'd say that the bouquet was subtly demure and playfully articulate. I got that from a bottle of ketchup. Charming. How long have you been here? - Two weeks. - Three day... - Three days. - Two week... We've been here two weeks and three days. - We're staying at the big... - I'm at the strand hotel. - It's very nice. - 1 don't like it. We... it's getting late. We must be going. Come, Walter. Walter? Uh... oh. Isn't that amusing? She doesn't even know my name. - It's Sam Randall. - Ohn. Yes. ohn Sam. Back in Washington, that makes for a lot of trouble. They get my name mixed up with lyndonohnson, you know, ohnson, Samohn. Well, let's be going. We're off to afskhanistan. Tunisia. Yeah. Afskhanistan, Tunisia. - Well, let's go, Marion. - Marion? I'm his lovely wife Carmen. - Charming. - Yes, goodbye. Well, Marion, this is it. Walter, if anything happens, I want you to know... Oh, stop talking about that. What's the worst thing could happen to us? We get caught. Big deal. They give us a fast trial, torture us a little bit. All we have to remember to do is to bite down hard on that cyanide capsule. Marion, have I ever let you down? I know I'm not the easiest man in the world to get along with. As a matter of fact, you might be amazed, but there are plenty of women who might think I was unpleasant. - No! - Honest. Mrs. hollander, I'm the luckiest guy alive. Everybody set? Ok. Now, remember, once you're past the guards, don't stop for anybody. Ok. Let's go. Good evening. Lovely party. Oh, Mr. hollander. Oh, no, no. I mean, Mr. Randall of Milwaukee. And his lovely wife Carmen. We wereust leaving. But I don't see how you can be leaving, madam x. You see, we have taken your car. Ow! Dad! Dad, listen. Krojack broke in here, and he's trying to take... He didn't break in. I invited him. You invited him? You are the hollanders, I presume. That's right. Yes, and this is my lovely son Susan. Oh, he's really a girl. Our other boy's at camp tonawanda until Tuesday. You'll be happy to learn that we've completed arrangements for your release. Now you're talking. Arrangements? What arrangements? In the interest ofustice, they'll stand trial. They'll be given a heavy sentence. I will intervene. It will be changed to a severe reprimand and a token sentence, 30 days at the most. 30 days? - 30 days? - 30 days? There are some waivers they'll have to sign. 30 days? Dad, you can't do this to... Axel, stay out. This is a fair deal. Krojack gets credit for the arrest, and he gives me back that tape recording, and he's also agreed to attack me viciously in the press. Now that alone will win the governorship for me in a landslide. Yeah, but, dad, what about the hollanders? They got the millman wedding, Seth is in camp, and Donald is waiting. Oh. What's 30 days to them? Let me get this straight. You're gonna turn us over to him? Mr. hollander, it was not an easy decision. On the one hand, we want to protect you, and on the other, we must protect the best interests of the United States. I thought they were the same thing. I'm afraid you don't understand these matters. No, but I'm beginning to understand. You guys are beautiful. You make all the goofs, and someone else pays. Mr. hollander, you've caused us enough embarrassment. Embarrassment? Is that what we were to you, an embarrassment? That's quite enough! Now I'm ordering you fo... Ordering? You're ordering me? I think you got things backwards. I'm a taxpayer. I don't work for you. You work for me, and if you were working for me as a caterer, you wouldn't last through the first course. If you're quite finished, I have a police wagon waiting outside. Walter, your bulge, it's worse than ever. Now you stand right where you are. Oh, here's that grimy little finger again. Wrong again, buster. Now get in that closet. We're getting out of here. Move! Reason with him. - Dad, I can't. - Don't argue! For once in your life, do something right! Yeah. Yeah, I think I should. Will you get out of there? What a team! Whoo! All right. Let's get out of here. In what? They took the randalls' car. - That's right. - Wait a minute. Wait a minute. There's krojack's paddy wagon. Look. I can put this on and pretend to be him... Oh, no, no, no. Wait a minute. That's no good. I don't speak the language. We'll never get past the guards. I'm coming along to see that your rights are protected. Mr. ambassador? - To where? - People's park, to look for an organ grinder. - They're not here! - They're not here? - The bus! - The bus! Good afternoon, Mr. hollander. You will proceed to the interior railroad station. Your contact there will be the ticket agent. This tape will self-destruct in five seconds. You know something? I think this sofa would look better over here. We must be at the grand hotel. Oh, isn't that nice? The ambassador came down to see us off. Get back! It's a trap. They got us. Oh. We almost made it. Wait. Wait a minute. I got an idea. Come on. Come here. Have my wives come down yet? No, sir, but their luggage is in the luggage room there, and your car's ready out front. Sultan. Excuse me. Would you come over here? All right. Now what do we do? We lost our contact. Look! There must be an airport near. A plane! We got it made! We got it made! Where? Where? There doesn't seem to be any airport. I can see that. What now? I don't know. There's hardly any gas left in the car. Zorkie, zorkie, zorkie. This is where I was supposed to escape six years ago. I was told go to a little red barn. A red barn? Well, that's a red barn. It's a red barn! Hello, buddy. Where was you? I've been waiting for six years. How many can you take? Two, maybe three at the most. You three go. Let Susan stay here. My daughter stay here and go toail? Well, no, sir, not necessarily. She could have complete immunity... As the wife of a diplomat. What? Susan marry you? You got to be some kind of a nut! Wait a minute. A ring. We need a ring. I got one. Come on! Hurry up! Hold that. Oh, thank you very much. Start, start. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. “Dearly beloved.” Ah. Dearly... Well, congratulations, kids. Thank you, dad. - And good luck. - Thank you, sir. She's gonna need it. All right, flash. Up, up, and away. - Does your plane have a radio? - Yes. Good. You can wire your silverware pattern. Bye, mommy. Well, we made it. Not yet, buddy. We are losing altitude real fast. We've got get rid of all excess weight fast! All right, Marion, unload. Oh, Walter. Unload! Don't drink the water
