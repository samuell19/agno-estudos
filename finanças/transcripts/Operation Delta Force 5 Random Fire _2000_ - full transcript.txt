The government of Kenya today reassured Washington that it is taking every precaution to assure the safety of the new United States ambassador Clarence Rodman and his family. It was just one week ago today that United States ambassador Harrison and his family were killed by a suicide bomber while en route to the theater. The Kenyan Rebel Organization claimed responsibility for the killing. Rebel leader Jafari Bin Kasim announced today that he will continue to resist any western intervention in Kenya and across Africa. Where the hell are they, Lieutenant? They should be here shortly, Ambassador. That's what you told me 15 minutes ago. I can assure you, Ambassador, that you and your family are perfectly safe on this train. When the Delta Force boys are on board this train, that is when I'll feel safe. I understand that, but until then the Kenyan government is doing everything to ensure your safety. There are soldiers on the ground, on top of the train, and there is a no-fly zone around the train. Then what is that plane doing there? That's NWTV broadcasting your arrival in Kenya. What are you trying to tell the world, Mr. Williams? That the new American ambassador is sneaking into Kenya on a freight train like a thief in the night? In light of what happened to Ambassador Harrison, I thought... I'm not interested in what you thought. Look. Just get on your radio and find out what's holding these guys up. I'm sorry, Ambassador. My orders are to maintain radio silence. I don't give a fuck what your orders are. I do not feel totally safe here. I can assure you, sir... Mr. Williams, might I suggest that you just shut up? Now, you get on that radio and you tell those Delta Force guys to get their asses on this train A.S.A.P., all right? Yes, sir. Aah! We got heavy at 12:00. Take it out! I'm out! Repeat transmission. Over. Repeat transmission. Over. Zebra 1 to track leader. Do you copy? Captain, it's Zebra. They broke silence. Shit! Zebra 1, this is track leader. Over. Zebra 1 to track leader. Zebra 1, this is... Medic! Zebra 1 to track leader. The line went dead, Ambassador. Give me that. This is Ambassador Clarence Rodman here. Do you copy? Ambassador Clarence Rodman here. Do you copy? Shit. Look, Dad. Look what we got. Show me what Mr. Williams gave you? Thank you, thank you. Is there something wrong, dear? No, no. Nothing's wrong, dear. Nothing's wrong. Can I open that? Yes. Ho, ho, ho, ho! Ha ha ha. No, you open it? In less than an hour. Ambassador Rodman will arrive in Nairobi to present his credentials to President Moi. The military is on full alert. Ambassador Rodman and his family... Let us die to make men free. Check this out. We're in the wrong fucking place. Son of a bitch! What the fuck kind of pilot are you? You landed in Kitale. You better believe it. The wrong fucking place! Ambassador's train's going through Kisumu. Those were my orders! How can you do this, Bruce? Shit! Medic! Charlie, cover us! How's he doing? He's dead, man. He's fucking dead. It's an ambush, Cap. Isn't possible. We landed in Kitale. How the fuck did they know we'd land here? I don't know, but they knew we were coming, man. Soldier. I don't want them dead, Malik. I need them alive. Yes, sir. I'm out. Fuck! No! You take it, Sarge. Take it, Cedric. This is for me. Okay? Let's go. Sergeant, I need a man. Scott! Scott, there's a door back there. Check it out. Captain, man down! Man fucking down! What's the plan? I got no plan, Bob. That's it. I'm fucking calling it quits. You're not calling the rescue team. We're the Delta Force, Cap. Our job is to rescue, not to be rescued. Face it, Bob, it's over! It's over. What the hell? Must be a mistake. Wish it was. I'll signal Kennedy we got it. Chopper 1, emergency signal received from Delta Force. Proceed to location. Copy that. I'm on my way. General, they just called in the rescue team. That's a bluff. The Delta Force never, never calls for help. It's their emergency frequency. What if it's for real, sir? Then it looks like we're going to get more than we bargained for. Aw! Son of a... Hey! Hey! Look at me. Look at me. Can you move your fingers? Yeah. Yeah. You're a lucky son of a bitch. You'll still be able to jerk off. Medic! Hold on, David. Just hold on, man. Come on! Come on! David! David! David, come on, man. David, don't talk. Don't talk. Skip... David, David, save your energy, man. Come on! I'm here, David. I'm here. I'm here. Come on, come on. Keep looking at me. Keep looking. Give that to my brother. No way, man. David, you're not gonna die. I'm not gonna let you go, David. Don't fucking die on me, man. Come on, David! Your mother's gonna be real pissed if you die on me, man. David, come on, man! Jesus! Fuck! Captain, there's a tunnel under the building. It runs all the way out past the railroad tracks. Is it clear? It's clear. Good. Reload. Go kick some ass. Duke. Duke! Duke, where the hell are you? Shit. Cap, I got to check on Duke. All right. I got one over here! Captain. David, he... he didn't make it. Go check on Cedric. Aah! Aw, fuck. Goddammit. Jesus. Duke. Duke, where are you, man? Duke. Duke. Answer me. Duke. Hey, it's okay, buddy. It's okay. Talk to me. Talk to me. T-Tell them to stop. I will. I will. I'll tell 'em. I'll tell 'em. Now, come on. We're getting out of here, partner. Not until you tell them to stop shooting. I'm giving you an order, soldier. Is that understood? Is that clear? Yes, sir. You're gonna grab your firearm, and you're gonna move your ass on my mark. Understood? Understood? Yes, sir. Good man. You ready? Okay. Let's move. Captain, I got a heavy at 10:00! Take it out! Got it! Over here. You're all leaving now! Duke, what the fuck are you doing, man? Captain's calling us. Move! Move for fuck's sake. Come on! Come on, we're on the move. Come on! Duke, come on, you're leaving now! You're going home, man. Scott, what the fuck's wrong with you, man? Come on. Stay with me, man! Stay with me! Don't fuck around. Let's go! I'm fine. I'm fucking fine! Jesus, you got to stop it. Just stop it. Stop it. Stop it! Duke! See, Sarge? I made them stop. Duke. Motherfuckers. Sons of bitches. Motherfuckers. Sons of bitches! Motherfuckers! Gary, stop! You motherfuckers! Fuck! Shit! Scott, you're gonna be okay, man. Take it easy. I'm staying right here. I'm not going anywhere. You kicked the shit out of those guys, man. I did, didn't I. You sure did, man. You sure fucking did. Captain. Requesting permission to stay with you, sir. Permission granted, Scott! Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. Come on. Stay with us, man. You're gonna be okay, man. It's okay, Scotty, it's okay. He's gone. Scotty, come on! He's gone. Come on, Gary. He's fucking gone! Scott! Cedric! Fuck! Cedric, calm down. Scott's gone, man. Scott's gone. How you doing, man? How you doing? It's just a scratch, buddy. You're gonna be fine. You're gonna be just fine. Fire! Sergeant, Charlie, Gary, Richie, Phil, over here. Men, the rescue team is on its way. You pick up your gear. You're leaving with the Sergeant now! I'm staying to cover. Captain, I'm staying here with you. Same goes for me, Captain. Captain. You got it, Cedric. You're staying with me. Skip, you too. We'll cover. Johnson, take the men to location for the rescue helicopter. Phil! Captain. Look, I just... Good-byes are for women, Phil. Just go. Captain, why can't I stay? 'Cause you're married, Charlie. No, I'm only engaged. Same freaking difference! Go! I don't even have a girlfriend, sir. That's why you're going. To get laid, Gary. You go. You take care, sir. Sergeant, you get these men home alive. I sure will, Cap. You tell my ex she can get any of my junk if she wants it. Also there's a will in my safe deposit box at the bank. Here. I want you to tell their families that they were brave. You tell them that they were heroes. And you tell them that they died for their fucking country. What... No! No! Sorry for disobeying your orders, Cap. Watch your head! Bob! Bob! Bob! It's been a pleasure serving with you, Brad. Cedric. Skip. Let's give 'em all we got, boys. What do you say, man? Let's do this. Bob! Bob! Bob! Shit! Clear. Clear. Captain, where are you? Clear. Right behind you. Keep moving. Hold your fire. Goddamn it, Gary, there's nobody there! Clear! Let's go. Over there. Okay, we're going in. Chopper. Hit the chopper. Don't let them get away. Come on! Come on! Go, go, go! Check Captain Kennedy is waiting, Forbes. I'll handle it, General. I'll report back to you later. That's all right. Okay. Proceed. I then heard Captain Kennedy shout, "No, Bob, No." And then what happened? Sergeant Johnson pushed Captain Kennedy into the tunnel. Did you see Sergeant Johnson pushing Captain Kennedy into the tunnel? No, sir, I didn't. Did Captain Kennedy try to reopen the door? He sure did, sir, but the door was locked from the inside, and the only way to open it was to blow it. Why didn't you? 'Cause we didn't have any explosives, sir. Did Captain Kennedy tell you why he didn't want you to stay behind? Yes, sir. He said because I was engaged to be married, sir. Let me get this straight, soldier. Captain Kennedy didn't want you to stay behind because he wanted you to go home and get laid. Yes, sir. Dismissed. Get this to Washington A.S.A.P. Does the phrase "All for one and one for all" mean anything to you, Captain? Of course, sir. That's our motto. Delta Force motto. And do you practice that motto, Captain Kennedy? Absolutely, sir. Then what were you thinking when you left. Private Cedric Bass and Corporal Skip Loomis behind? Skip and Cedric insisted on staying, sir. Why didn't you draw straws? There wasn't time for that. Tell me why you all didn't stay behind. A few had to stay behind to give cover to the rescue team, sir. And it was clear to you whoever stayed behind stood no chance of survival unless of course... you surrendered. Surrender was out of the question, sir. Very good, Captain. That'll be all. Hello, Captain. Is it that bad, John? General Hyde wants you suspended until the committee report's out. If you're cleared, he said he'll reinstate you. I guess I can use some R and R. But I want you out, Brad. For good. You've destroyed the reputation of the Delta Force, which I built up with the sweat of my brow. You ran out of that compound like a mouse from a sinking ship. General, my men and I were outnumbered... You fucked up, Brad. Badly. And it wasn't the Israeli army you were fighting. Or the British, the French. It was a bunch of Kenyan assholes who don't know which end of the rifle bullets come out of. I wouldn't say we were fighting untrained soldiers, sir. Don't tell me who the enemy is, Captain! We've been studying those rebels and their leader, Jafari Bin Kasim. Sergeant Sommers is here, sir. Send her in. That'll be all, Sergeant Sommers. Here. That's what's left of the compound. You can add another three names to your casualty list. Take a closer look, Captain. They left their sprinklers on all night. You must be tired driving all the way from Fort Bragg. It was a drive. This was David's favorite chair. He used to spend hours sitting in it and reading. He loved to read. This is my favorite picture of David. He wanted to be an electronics engineer, but first he wanted to do his duty. He was a good soldier, ma'am. Truth is, I tried to talk him out of it, but he wouldn't listen to me. You probably also didn't want to listen to your mother. You're right, I didn't. No mother wants their son to go to war. Please come and sit down. I want you to meet my husband. Joe, come on down! You must be hungry. You've driven a long way. I'm gonna get you something to eat. No, no, please. Got some great chicken soup. It'll do you good. It always does. Joe! Joe! I'm here. Captain Kennedy. Yes, sir. David spoke very highly of you. Please take a seat. That's my dad. May he rest in peace. Taken two days before D-Day. Died on the beach at Normandy. I was four years old. Barely remember him. He was a handsome young man. David looked a little bit like him. This is... This is me. Vietnam. Two tours. Yeah. My father was killed in Vietnam. He was a fighter pilot. Lot of my friends died right beside me. Ruby, that's my youngest son... Ruby! He wants to be a fighter pilot. You ought to see his room. Ruby! Whole ceiling's just covered in model airplanes. He'll be anxious to meet you. Dad. Ruby, say hello to Captain Kennedy. Son. Ruby, what's wrong? You killed my brother. Ruby! Get the fuck out of my house. Ruby, go back to your room right now. Why, Dad? You yourself said he was responsible for what happened in Kenya. Isn't that why they discharged you? Hell, Captain, we know it wasn't your fault. I remember in Nam you couldn't tell one village from another. I'm not sure I understand, Mr. Berman. You landed at the wrong place. That's what General Thompson said. Right. I better go. David wanted you to have these. Ruben, your brother David was my friend. He was a brave soldier, and it was an honor and privilege to have him in my platoon. Now, you remember that, son. The conference for African economic development is underway at the Boston Financial Center in Copley Square. European and American business leaders are meeting with the finance ministers of many African nations to discuss investment in Africa. Security is extremely tight for fear of attack... Let us die to make men free. Are the governments stable enough to support these economic ventures? Yes, we believe that the economic support will help create long-term benefits for both the governments and investors. Excuse me, sir. I'm staying here with you. Um, excuse me, sir. Die to make men free. Captain! Karen, what are you doing here? We need to talk. What's wrong? Everything. Brad, you better sit down. No. What's wrong, Karen? Look, you heard what happened today in Boston. What, the bombing? Yeah. I already saw this on the news. I want you to watch it. Holy shit! That looks just like... Yes. It is Cedric. He became one of Jafari's suicide bombers. His photo was taken by a security camera moments before he blew himself up. No, it can't be Cedric. Cedric's dead, Karen. They found his dog tags on the bomber's body. That means Johnson and Skip might be alive. This morning we picked up an emergency signal from Jafari's headquarters in Kenya. And that's what I came to tell you. You know, Thompson'll court-martial you for giving me classified information. You know that. No, he won't. I got too much on him. I know what he did to you guys in Kenya. What did he do? He diverted you to Kitale. He knew that Jafari was listening, and he wanted him to think that the Ambassador's train was being rerouted to Kitale to pick up the Delta Force. Wait a minute, you're saying Thompson used us as bait. He has an agenda to eliminate Jafari. At any cost. And how do you know this, Karen? Thompson set up a secret unit to find out Jafari's whereabouts, and he put me in charge. So for the past year all I've been doing is studying the profile of Jafari. I know him better than his five wives put together. Did Thompson try to eliminate Jafari? Yes, he did. He sent those missiles while we were still there, didn't he. Yeah. Open that door, soldier. I said open that door now! Yes, sir. Send the signal to the ship immediately. Yes, sir. Why did you lie to me? Why did you tell me they were dead? Take your hands off me, Brad, or... Or what? You send me back to Kitale, be bait for Jafari? Send missiles, blow up my fucking men? Want me to remove him, sir? It's all right. You can leave now. You sure, sir? I'm fine. You're gonna spend the rest of your life in jail for what you did to my men. Karen! I got the proof right here. If I go down, so will she. For passing classified information. It'll be worth it if it stops the killing, General. Defending our freedom, justice, and the American way of life sometimes requires casualties. Each one of us in a uniform is a potential casualty. If you really want to know about defending our country, let me tell you. A few must die so others will live. So I suggest you start thinking about tomorrow's mission, Brad. Karen. Thanks. Thanks a lot. Fellas, what's up? All right. Captain. All right, let's get down to business. This morning the Minnesota picked up an emergency signal from Kenya. We're hoping that's our boys. We'll be taking off for the Indian ocean tomorrow at 0600 hours. We'll meet up with the Minnesota. From there, move on to Kenya and bring back Johnson and Skip. Now I'd like to take this opportunity to say good-bye to Corporal Charlie Moore and to thank him for his commitment and honorable service to our country. It's been a pleasure. I'd like you to please join me in saying hello to Sergeant Charles Moore, your new sergeant. Sarge! I just found out you're coming on the mission. Why, Karen? Why what? Why what. You know what I'm talking about. Thompson assigned me this job. And you can say no. What? And rot in jail? Thanks for the advice. And besides, I want to go. Don't do this to me, Karen, please. I'm not doing this to you. I'm doing it for me. You know, this isn't a game we're playing here. Don't lecture me again. I'm going, and that's final. This is real war here. Real explosions, real guns. People are going to get killed, and when they die they don't come back when you put three more quarters in the machine. That's it. Game's over forever. I know that. I'm a soldier, remember? No, you're a woman. Excuse me? I meant you're my woman. Ex, Brad. Ex. You left me because you said that you couldn't lead men to war knowing that there was a wife at home worrying about you. Do you remember saying that? I'd rather have you in jail where you're safe. I'd die if anything happened to you, Karen. I'd die. It's funny you say that. You sound just like me. This just came in from the White House. It's from the President. "Members of the elite Delta Force, "Jafari Bin Kasim crossed the line "when he exported terrorism into our backyard. "Your mission is to apprehend Bin Kasim "and bring him here to stand trial "for the murder of American citizens. Good luck and may God be with you." Gentlemen... the President of the United States would like us to apprehend Bin Kasim and bring him home to stand trial. But we all know what the result is gonna be. After months of a costly trial for which the American taxpayers will pick up the tab, Jafari will receive a minimum jail term with all the perks at the Plaza Hotel Penitentiary. This is unacceptable. To me, to you, and to the American people for whom we took the oath to defend and protect. The only sentence Bin Kasim deserves is the same sentence he delivered to his victims. With all due respect to our Commander in Chief... I say we go after Bin Kasim with everything we've got and blast his ass off the face of this Earth. All in agreement. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Captain Kennedy. Sir. We all know what Jafari's capable of doing. We saw what he did to Cedric. We can assume that Sergeant Johnson and Corporal Skip Loomis face a similar fate, which is why we're here. We believe it is not too late to bring home our men. One for all, all for one! One for all, all for one! Our job is to lase Jafari's headquarters for the cruise missiles which will be launched from the Minnesota. Once the laser detector is put in place, we have 15 minutes, and I repeat, 15 minutes, to get in, get Johnson and Loomis, and get out of there. Is that clear? Yes, sir. Sergeant Sommers, we've got a signal. It's coming from the seaport. Once we land, we divide into three groups. Jackson, Vince, you will stay outside. Clear a way for the incoming choppers and give us cover. Captain. The emergency signal's not coming from Jafari's headquarters. You sure? Where is it coming from? It's coming from a seaport near Kenya. Roughly about 150 miles from Jafari's camp. I bet they escaped. I doubt it. So do I. If Johnson and Skip aren't sending the signal, then who is? Jafari? That thought did cross my mind. I don't get it. Why would Jafari send a signal from his headquarters and then travel 150 miles to send another one? Well, the only logical explanation would be that maybe Jafari wants us to think that Johnson managed to escape. You think it's a trap. I'm afraid I do. Well, there's one way to find out. No, Brad, you're not going. What if you're wrong, General? What if Johnson and Skip are in that port at this very moment waiting for us to get in there with a rescue team? Are you willing to risk more lives than you're gonna save? Johnson and Skip risked their ass to save our lives, General. We're paying 'em back. Okay. You go. Five of you. Surveillance mission. Yes, sir. Seaport's in our range. The Delta Force is ready, sir. Is there any word on Jafari's whereabouts? No, but everything seems too quiet. Brad. Brad, I... No. I don't want to say it. But I want to say it. Captain. Gary. We're waiting. All right. Okay. Sergeant. Okay, we get Johnson and Skip and we get the hell out of there. Captain, up ahead, boat approaching. Wait for my signal. Everything's quiet. Let's take a pass on the other side. They're gone. Pull over there. Signal's coming from that warehouse. I don't like it. It's too quiet. Captain. Move! Warehouse door. Move! Move! These Americans never learn from their mistakes. All right, they're 60 yards away. Jackson, Gary, you take that door. You got it, Captain. Charlie, Phil, you come with me. Sergeant Johnson. Skip. Skip, it's me, Charlie. Jackson, what's going on out there? Seems okay here, Cap. Gary, how's it look your way? Okay my side, Cap. Sergeant Johnson. Bob, can you hear me? Skip. Charlie, fire at that hole. I thought you assholes would never come. What kept you? We had a whole welcoming committee out here. Hey, man. What are you doing, Captain? Looks like you put on a few pounds there, Skip. Well, that's what comes from eating good food all day. Where's Sergeant Johnson, Skip? He's not here. What do you mean he isn't here? Where is he then? Where? I haven't seen him since Kitale. Boy, am I glad to see you. Why didn't you and Johnson stick together? Sergeant Johnson thought it would be better for our survival if we split up. Which direction did the Sergeant take? He went east. Cedric went west. I headed south until I got here. You sure you headed south, Skip? Sure. Why? 'Cause we're west of Kitale, man, not south of it. Idiot. Don't talk too much. Welcome, Delta Force. You're surrounded. Lay down your weapons and come out with your hands above your heads or you die. I'm giving you three minutes. Ground control, this is team leader. Over. This is ground control. Go ahead. General, we got Skip, but Johnson's not here. Where is he? Skip doesn't know. Jafari's soldiers are all over the place outside. We're gonna need reinforcements quickly. I copy. We can hold 'em off, but not for long. I copy. They're on their way. Brad, I want you to leave your radio open. Yes, sir. Leave that line open! Your reinforcements are not going to save you, Captain. Your time's up. Let us die to make men free. What the fuck is he saying? My God, Brad. Brad, Skip is gonna blow himself up at the end of the song. No. Do something. Skip, no. Press the button, Skip. Press it. I could take him out, Captain. No! Skip, no! Skip, no! Phil, take cover now! Skip, no. No. Skip, no. I knew you'd come for me, Cap. What'd you think, we're just gonna leave you here in Africa? Thanks, Cap. Thanks for letting me on your team. You're on this team 'cause you're the best around, pal. When I get my discharge... Let's go! I'm gonna go to med school. I know you are. You'll make a great doctor, Skip. Work in E.R. That's where you belong, man. Skip, can you tell us where Sergeant Johnson's at? They've got him in the dungeon. You mean headquarters. Cedric called it the dungeon. Skip. Fuck, Skip. Our mission is to infiltrate Jafari's headquarters and lase it for the missiles. Now, once the laser guide is turned on, we'll have 15 minutes, and I repeat, 15 minutes, to get in, get Johnson, and get the hell out of there. Is that clear? Yes, sir. Sergeant Sommers will guide us with real-time satellite photos. Sergeant. Jafari's a chameleon. The thrill of seeing his suicide bombers blowing themselves up brings him closer to the crime scene. Now, this photo was taken by a reporter after the explosion in Boston, and here we see Jafari the man videotaping the aftermath of the explosion. Now, it wouldn't surprise me if Jafari... This is a nonsmoking building, Corporal. It wouldn't surprise me if Jafari took these home videos and shared in moments of pleasure with Dr. Oleg Karlovich. Now, he's the notorious Russian psychiatrist who brainwashes these young men and turns them into suicide bombers. He's also known for his experiments with remote mind control, and he refers to his suicide bombers as his pets. So if you find Dr. Karlovich, it's most likely Sergeant Johnson won't be too far behind. You should also note this symbol. You'll find it painted in blood on the doorframe of a suicide bomber's room. What does the symbol mean? Well, African tribes believe that the serpent protects them from being harmed by the spirits of the people they've killed, and Dr. Karlovich uses this in his remote mind control process. I have to warn you though, this symbol spells danger, so if you see it on the door in Sergeant Johnson's room, know that he's dangerous and probably armed even if he appears friendly. Carry on, Sergeant. I'm all done, General. Okay, men, all I can say to you is good luck. Bring back the son of a bitch and I hope you get home safely. Good luck, Brad. Hope you find Johnson and bring him home. Thank you, sir. Now let's take another look at those aerial surveillance photos. Karen. Karen. Karen! Look, about the other night... Please... don't, Brad. Good-byes are for women. That's what you always say. Look, I've got to go. Visibility is zero. We need to clear the clouds. Roger that. Watch out for Jafari's men. We're five minutes from the drop zone. All is clear up ahead. Smooth sailing to Jafari's compound. Bandit at 12:00. Let's take him down. You watch my back. I'm going in. I'm right behind you. Watch the sky! Where is he? I can't find him. Watch your 5:00! Okay, I found him. I found him. Take this. Son of a bitch is good. He's not that good, Captain. Fucking very close. You're goddamn right it is. I lost him! I lost him! All right, I got him on my side. Damn it! Where'd he go? He's quick! Where'd he go? Keep your eyes open. Watch your 10:00. Charlie, 10:00. Aah! Shit, Phil, are you all right? It's okay. I'm all right, Charlie. Just a fucking scratch. He's on my tail. I can't shake him. Okay, I'm coming in. Tiger's still on my tail. Coming in for another pass. Thanks, partner. Now let's finish him off. I roger that. What the hell is he doing? It looks like he's... My God! Get the hell out of there! Damn, that was close. Gonna nail him. Yeah, he's smoking! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah, you nailed him all right, Vinny. That was a touchdown. All right, boys, let's get Johnson and bring him home. General. Jafari's helicopter's still in the compound. He's still there. Good news. Get a lock on that, can you? Richie, take that tower out now! You got it, sir! Richie, the tower, Richie. Aah! Go! Go! Go! The tower's down, Captain. Tower is down. Jackson, Vince, take out that left bunker now! Let's go! All right, boys. On three, you cover me. Ready? Ready, Cap. 1, 2, 3. Aah! Let's move! All right, let's move! Move! Move! Let's hit 'em. Richie, man at 6:00. All right, let's move. Gary, bandit 12:00. Take him out. Bunker three clear. All right, fellas, synchronize your watches. Got it, Cap. Got it, Cap. At 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Laser's set. Set. Laser's on, Cap. Remember, 15 minutes. That's all we got. Get in, get out. Let's do it. Gary, take point. Gentlemen, let's move. One of the lasers was set. We got a signal. Do you concur, Captain? I concur, sir. On my mark. 3, 2, 1. Launch! Vince, Jackson, clean up the place and give us cover. Clear. Karlovich, how's he doing? For a big man, he's flying nice and high. Vinny, 11:00. Take him. Got it. Clear. Clear. Clear. Clear. Clear. Clear. Go! Go! Clear. All right, Austin, fire that hole. Gary, you take the point. Yes, sir. Clear. Sergeant Johnson! Bob! Bob, can you hear us? All right, move out! Move! I want everybody out of here now! Charlie, take point. Come on, let's go! Move, move, move! Welcome, Captain Kennedy. To what do I deserve this honor? You know very well why I'm here, Jafari. Of course. How presumptuous of you, Captain, because unless you lay down your weapons and surrender, you're all going to die in here. General Thompson, you there? This is ground control. Proceed. Aren't you forgetting Sergeant Johnson? I got a deal for you, Jafari. A deal? Now, this I've got to hear. Go ahead, Captain! I'm listening. What the hell's he doing? I don't know, but he must have a plan. Jackson, Vince, we're coming out. Okay, Jafari, here's the deal. Let Johnson go and let's all get the hell out of here. Now, why would I settle for that? Because in seven minutes this place is gonna get blown to fucking bits by three cruise missiles. Nice try, Captain. You don't believe me, you can ask General Thompson. He's the one that sent 'em. Tell him, General. You're crazy, Brad. He's gonna cut loose. Is that true, General Thompson? Talk to him, General, please. Stay out of this, Sergeant. Tell him, General. Are you trying to make a fool of me, Captain? Goddamn it, General, tell him. It's true, Jafari. It's true. Missiles have been launched. Hand it over, Sergeant! Hand it over! That's an order. Captain. We finally meet face to face. I'll make a deal with you. But first the missiles must be destroyed. No way. Johnson and I leave, and then I take care of the missiles. Dismissed. Captain, get out of there now. That's an order. General, I'm busy here. Son of a bitch! What about Cap? Don't worry. Brad's gonna get Johnson. They're gonna get out of there. But we only got two minutes left. Looks like we're all going to die in here, Captain. I'll shoot you first. Let us die to set men free. No. Jafari, tell him to stop. Karlovich. Johnson's mine. He responds to only what I say. Bob, listen to me. You'll do what I say. I will do what you say. The last one's for me, Bob. Remember that? Last bullet's for me. The last bullet's for me. The last bullet's for me. The last bullet's for me, buddy. For me. The last bullet's for me, buddy. Remember? All right, Jafari, let's go. Move! Bob. Bob. Wake up, Bob. Wake up, pal. Bob, it's me. Look at me. Come on. Come on, pal. We got to get out of here. They drugged me. I know they did, man. You got to work with me. You got to move. You got to work with me. You got to work with me. Brad and the boys are still there, General. Deactivate the missiles. I can't do that, Sergeant. This is war. Please. I'm sorry, Karen. They're past the point of no return. It's over, guys. Cap's taking too long. We should go back and get him. Charlie, we got to go back and fetch him, man. Stay put. We got one minute. Come on, man. Let's go. Okay. Have to keep moving. Keep moving. Keep moving. Okay, let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Yeah! I knew they'd make it. Cut it awfully close. Whoo! Direct hits, sir.
