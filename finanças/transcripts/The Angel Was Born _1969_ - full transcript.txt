The Angel Was Born. Yeah, I'm Urtiga (Nettle). No one touches me, or they'll get blisters. Come on, cut that out! Is it because of men, women or drugs? Cut that out, Saint Mary. Don't pester me Urtiga. Stay out of my way. Don't pester me. Stay out of my way. Yeah, it's cool. Here's the deal: we have to go there. It's time, Saint. Not yet. The situation's rough down there. - The police are closing in. - But they want to come up. Are we going to surrender like rabbits? No. Not like rabbits... What a situation, didn't I say so? If we stay, we die. I'm gonna have to stay a whole month here. Fuck! I'll help you out, stay cool. No. Then I'll get better anyway. Wake up, Saint! The woman is coming. What is it? What is it now? Didn't you ever see someone die? What is it now? Didn't you ever see someone die? Are you insane? Stop all that noise! Urtiga, Throw him in the woods. Ok, fine. Good food, nice lady... - My kind of girl. - It has to be like this. Everybody together, full table... ...everyone the same, and together on the table... What bad manners! I am incorrigible, full of vices! But for me, what's right is what is wrong. And what's wrong is what is right. Got it? For, I'm the one that's right. And you ma'am... you're.... the wrong one. - I said it and mean it. - Perfectly. You mean the lady is giving herself away here on her journal? Good one! Reminders for the trip: panties, bras... petticoat, tissues and alarm clock. ...song lyrics, crosswords... Look: thoughts "optimist is the one who one day wants to live in heaven". Right. That's right. In Heaven. That's where I'm going. I got that one. - Again... - Shut up, Urtiga. Stop that otherwise I'll stab you, right? "Marriage without children is a bell without chime." "Poor is the one who believes in glory and money for happiness. That's right. The boy is right. What a revelation! "Only marriage can change a rose to cabbage." "Love is like a butterfly, it only lives for a few hours." Everything is relative. What are you talking about ma'am? Are you lonely? You mean your husband doesn't... you know? You dolt! That's right. It doesn't work. And I don't like women who complain. I don't like nervous women! I'l show you, come here! Tremendous fool! I don't buy all this moon story. This guy is out of it too. Why all this business of going to the moon? I'm there a long time already. Go get some water. And the paper too. Let's sell this machine and make some good money. - Wait, we'll leave tomorrow. - What about them? - We rub them out. - Exactly! - Where's the paper? - I didn't find it. What? What a bummer. Our time is coming. I saw the angel! I saw the angel! - Quick, our time will come! - Again with that angel... I'll only kill you if you believe in what I say. It's only mine, get it? Careful! Run! Run, I saw the angel, run! So? How are you? Still the same. No effect yet. No, it' still early. It's not possible. The angel wouldn't pull this on me. - What? - Nothing. Help! There's a robber in the pool. Help! Mister, help me! Help! For the love of God, no! I don't want to die! We'll die too sometime. But you're going first. We'll meet up there. Here's the deal man: you screamed at the wrong time. But you're still going ahead, like the Saint said. Go ahead and make things ready for us. Otherwise there'll be another dose. And with ember. Watch out man. Stay there. - This one's packed! - Really? - Look at the sucker's face! - Let me see the dope's face... That's how it goes. That's how it goes man. That's how it goes. That's how it goes, man. Look: Mair Tavares. Perfect. One more of these and we can buy a ranch and rest. Of course. We'll do it on the highway. There's a lot on the way. - Buy a ranch! - Rest! Live in peace! That's what I want, my brother. I don't know if I'll fit in with the country life. This bird killing business isn't with me. I'm a city man. The police are onto us now, but they'll forget about it. You're scared man? Give us a smoke there, will you? Man! Look at that. - Perfect. - Yeah. Perfectly. Please. - How's the faggot doing there? - Sleeping. - Let's go. - Poor her. Help me Exu, close the road and open my path. Help me Indian of seven arrows. Indian of souls, open my path. He's Indian, he's an archer... his seven arrows will protect... Came from Aruanda... in the name of the Lord... Tell me something nigger. If I died today, what would you do? What are you talking about? You're not going to die. - What's all this bullshit talk? - I'm serious. If I died today, now... ...how would you handle yourself? What's all this talk? You're not going to die. If I really died today. What's all that talk Saint? You're not going to die man. I'm with you, I'm with God. You'd better think about it, right? I'm not a troublemaker but I'm right... ...It was yesterday they hit the window of my shed... ...Jumped off my bed, pulled my knife and said "get out of here kid"... ...leave some happiness to me... ...My lady on the window says she's just kidding... ...damn lady, you're as ugly as a monkey... - Watch the step! - I looked at her and said "now, to the kitchen"... ...punched her on the face and threw her in the sink... ...who was it that said this woman wouldn't fit? (again) Let's go. Exit. Caught a bus up north, to come to live in Rio... ...goodbye father, goodbye mother. Goodbye city of Belem do Para. Sold all the junk I had... ...the rest I gave away... ...I may come back sometime... ...or I may stay there. Mother game me some advice, at the time of my embarking... ...My son, walk the straight line, so that God may help you... I've been a long time in Rio now, never went back there... From a whole month to ten years. Goodbye Belem do Para. Caught a bus up north, to come to live in Rio... ...goodbye father, goodbye mother. Goodbye city of Belem do Para. End.
