(thunder rumbling) Listen, there's a medical clinic two blocks from here. Do you want me to take you? My car's just there. (woman groaning) You look like you need help. It's all right, you can trust me, grab my arm. (woman groaning) (thunder rumbling) (ominous tempo music) - I'm sure it won't be long now, mate. - Mister? Mr. Large? You might as well go home now. We'll take it from here. - What happened? - She has a miscarriage. Really, you can go. - Wow. - I'll tell you what, can you give this to her for me, please? Thanks. (somber tempo music) (man groaning) (Large laughing) (television crowd cheering) - Oh. - Oh, no, no. - This is... - No. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. (pleasant music) - So, are you in the mood today, hun? - Mmmm, not really, babe. I've gotta wash my hair and get an early night for work tomorrow. (phone buzzing) - Hello? - [Candice] Hey. It's me from the other day. - Oh, hi. - [Candice] I didn't get a chance to thank you. - Oh, that was nothing, really. - [Candice] I'd really like to thank you in person. What are you doing now? - Nothing. - [Candice] I'll give you an address and you can come meet me. - What, now? (gentle tempo music) - [Candice] Yeah, why not? - Okay. (somber instrumental music) - Oh, hey. - Hey. Is Candice here? - Are you Jake? - Yeah, how'd you know? - She's just about to start rehearsals. Take a seat. - All right, thanks.

Sure. (somber tempo music) - Well, thanks again. So, I guess this is goodbye. (gentle music) (engine rumbling) (somber string plucking music) (Celine moaning) - What the fuck, Jake? Fucking hell! Jesus, Jake! Fuck! (Celine stomping) (Jake sighing) - So you say the dog bit you on the face. - Yes. The owner had the dog sitting on top of the counter in the shop. Can you believe it? - Well that's illegal. - Tell me about it. - And you were there to shop. - Absolutely. And when I approached the counter to pay for the goods, I lean forward and the little monster, he scratched me on my cheek. - Have you got evidence of the assault, like photos or medical reports? - Yes. - And did you require any restorative plastic surgery? - Oh, yes. God, I've had, I've had it. - And you can prove that too, I presume. - You bet your ass. - We might have a case here. - Well, great, because I wanna sue that bastard for all he's worth. - So, as an actress, I presume you lost income due the time it took to heal, et cetera. - Definitely. - Well I don't think the type of dog warrants a criminal case to push local council but I due believe we can sue the owner. - Oh, great. - Any other questions while you're here today? - Just one. - And what's that? - How do you take your eggs in the morning? (Celine grunting) - Calm down, will you? Calm down. Are you guys at it again? - I don't know. The usual, I guess. - How long have you been engaged for now? - About a year. - Mm-hmm. - I don't even like this stupid ring. - Oh, come on, that's a bit much. Look, he's a good guy. You could do worse. - You reckon? - Darling, you weren't born into money. He's on the up. Why not hang in there a bit? I know how relationships can be really tough on you. But I'm positive he worships the ground you walk on. - What? So I'm just supposed to settle to make everyone else happy? - Calm down, I didn't say that. - Dad, you're not even listening to me! - I didn't say you could have a key. (foreboding music) Not again. (ominous music) (Celine humming tune) (gentle piano music) - How's work? - Good. - How are you going? - Standard. - No news is good news, huh? I'm fine, by the way. - What? (dramatic piano music) Dad came past today. He said to say hi. - Ah. (phone buzzing) (door slamming) Hello? - [Candice] Hey, what are you doing? - Sweet FA. - [Candice] Can you come over? - What, now? - [Candice] I want you inside me. - You okay? - [Candice] If you come over I will be.

She's passed away. - I'm sorry. - Are you all right? - Who the hell was that? - That's my step dad.

Jake, this is Anton. (foreboding music) - Anyway, look, I'm late enough as it is. I better get to work. - Okay, babe, call me after, yeah? - Yeah, cool. - So what are you? - I'm a lawyer. (ominous music) Nice to meet you. (gentle instrumental music) - So, did you wanna have a chat? - Oh, so now you wanna talk. - I called the office, they said you weren't at work. Did you go out last night? - Yep. - Is it drugs? - Please. - Are you gambling again? - I'll pretend I didn't hear that one. - Another woman then. Hmm. Okay. Good. - Good? - Well, I guess now's a good a time to tell you as any. I've met someone. - Oh that explains it. - It takes two to tango, Jacob. - Took the words out of my mouth, Celine. (ominous music) Fuck. Fuck. (somber tempo music) (ominous music) (somber music) (Jake knocking) - Well, hello there. - Hey. - [Candice] Jake, come in. - Hey. - [Candice] This is Tonina. - Hey. - Pleased to meet you. - So Candice tells me you're a lawyer. - Mm-hmm. - And you're engaged? - Not anymore. - What? - Yep, as of about an hour ago, engagement is off. Say, can I used the bathroom? - Yeah, of course, babe. - Good choice. - You think? - He's perfect. (foreboding music) - Fantastic. Oh, thank you so much. No, I'll certainly be in contact with you. It's my pleasure. Thank you. Not a problem, you too, have a good day. Thank you. Bye. Bye. Burning the candle at both ends, are we? - Look at you. - What about me? - You know, you're too good for this job. Why am I so lucky to have you? - Don't speak too soon. You know my real plan is to become a PI here. - Oh yeah, private investigation. You'd be good at that. - Really? - [Jake] Absolutely. - Why is that? - 'Cause no one will ever expect you to be one. You're too good looking. (Ayla laughing) - Jakey boy, you're such a smooth talker. Hey, you're not wearing your ring. (phone ringing) - Lawyers Large, Jake Large speaking. (foreboding music) Yeah, okay. Yeah, hang on. Just calm down, calm down. Yeah, I'll come over. (ominous music) Yeah, all right, well I'll handle it when I get there. Yeah. Just wait for me. Okay? I'll see you soon. Bye, bye. (ominous music) - Hey, you just got here. - I know, something's come up. I'm gonna have to bail but I'll be back later. - You okay? - No time but I'll tell you later. (foreboding music) - What are you up to? What are you up to? (ominous music) - Candice. Candice, where are you? Oh my God, you all right? What happened? - He came by breaking in and uninvited. - What, your step dad? - I told him we were seeing each other and he got angry. - What, so he hit you? - Fuck me. (ominous music) Just fuck me, babe. (Candice moaning) (Jake huffing) - So what's the deal with this place? - It's my mom's investment property. To be honest, it's an Air B&B. - You don't wanna stay at the family home? - [Candice] Oh, God no. There's no way I could handle living under the same roof as that prick. No way. - [Jake] Fair call. - Ever since my mom passed away, that prick has just been like a leach around me. - Look, no offense, but he did hit you. I mean, why keep him around? You don't need that shit in your life. - It's family. Money. Loose ends. It's complicated. - Isn't everything? - Jake, I want that fucker gone. I just... I just wish someone would... kill him. (foreboding music) I want him dead. Then I'll be happy. Only then. (car beeping) (engine rumbling) (gentle piano music) - Moving out? - What else, babe? - Just my bag in there, hun, and then we're done. - Nice guy. - You know, I used to think you were good, but compared to Lance, you're pathetic. - Glad it's working out for you. Oh, you're all class, Celine. Oh great, just more protection. - Jake, I know things haven't been running smooth for awhile now. - Hey, what do you think I'm gonna do to her? - I'm here because she asked me to be here. - Oh great, three against one. - Dad, I'll be outside. - Jacob, she's been in a lot of pain. - What, and I haven't? I mean, mate, I've been going through my own pain too, you know? - Sorry it didn't work out, Jacob. (melancholic music) - Jesus, what now? (phone buzzing) Okay, hang on, hang on, hang on. Slow down, slow down. Don't worry, I'm coming over. No, now, now. I'm coming over now. I'm out the door. Now. (lively tempo music) - He's a lawyer, goddamn it! - Hey. I think it's time for you to leave, pal. - Cock sucker. - What'd you say? - Your key, goddamn it! - Unbelievable. (somber music) - Hey, yeah, it's me. You awake? I need you to do me a favor. Take out the trash. (foreboding music) - Oh yeah? Well, I mean, the weather seems okay, I guess. - I thought it was gonna be-- - Hey! I didn't expect to see you back so soon. - Ta-da! - Oh my God, wow. For me? - Absolutely for you. - You shouldn't have. - Well I had to. It's just a little sentiment. Just to show you how much I appreciate the fantastic job you've been doing. It's just amazing. - Thank you so much. - And you are so great at what you do. And if you ever need anything, just let me know, won't you? - Okay, I will. (Jake clearing throat) (Ayla laughing) - Don't look at me. - [Jake] Have we got a vase in this place? - Jakey boy, that's what happens when you don't wear your ring. (thunder rumbling) (ominous tempo music) - Huh? Huh? (thug grunting) (punch thudding) - Between the legs since '84, buddy. Now you are messing with the wrong guy, man. - Okay, okay. Okay. - And you're messing with a lawyer. - Yeah. Okay, yeah. - Now you're gonna tell me who contracted you to jump me. - Okay. Okay. - I'm listening. Ah, hands where I can see 'em. - [Thug] It's on my phone, I swear. - Give me a name. - I can't, I can't! All I've got's a photo. Okay. I don't have a name. All I've got is a photo. (ominous tempo music) - Oh, fuck. - You're not gonna press charges, are you? - Just get the fuck out of here. (ominous music) - I'm sorry, babe. - Well, I'm involved now. - But seriously, we should kill him. The planet would be better off without him. (foreboding music) - How? - Serious? - Are you? - I've thought about it hard, I mean, once a month he goes shooting rabbits. - Where? - In the mountains, not far. I know exactly where and it's routine. I've been with him before. - Go on. - Well, it's his hobby. He's all alone out there. - So what's your point? - Well, I mean, if you had a licensed gun, you two could go shooting rabbits, couldn't you? "Pow, whoops. "I shot the wrong rabbit. "My bad." I'm sure you'll figure out a way. (foreboding music) - "Pew. "Whoops. "Shot the wrong rabbit. "Sorry." - Hey, my man, what's up? My man, you look stressed. - Oh man, I got some shit going on. I need a favor. - Name it. - You're not gonna like it. I need a piece. - Damn, dog. What'd you get yourself into now? - It's just for a couple of days, then I'll return it. Listen-- - No, no, no, no. I don't wanna know about it. - So you'll be able to destroy it when I'm done, yeah? So you'll do it? - Yes. (sinister tempo music) (birds chirping) (gunshot booming) - Ah! Fuck! Man, what the fuck are you doing here? - Sorry, mate, sorry. I came down to make peace with you. - Oh what, and you fucking shot me? - Well, I was aiming for the rabbit. I was gonna surprise you. - Oh, you fucking surprised me all right. - I think. - Fuck! - Don't move. Listen, man, listen. - Fuck! - There's mobile around here. I'm gonna have to take you to the hospital myself. - Shit. - Come to the car. - I don't think I can fucking make it. - Just put some pressure on the wound. Follow me. - Aw, man, this sucks. Fuck! Ah! What the fuck were you thinking? (ominous music) Oh, fucking hell. - I'll get the door. I'll get the door. - Oh, shit. Oh, God, fucking hell. - You all right? - [Anton] Yeah. (Anton groaning) Jesus Christ. - Okay, you down, you lie down a bit and get some rest. - Oh, God. Fuck. You call the ambulance yet? - No. Afraid not. And don't hit women, you son of a bitch. - [Anton] What the fuck? Hey, you can't do this! This would be murder! Hey! Hey, you're a fucking lawyer, for fuck sake! Oh, fuck! Oh, Jesus! (Anton screaming) (ominous music) (Anton coughing) Oh no. Fuck! Shit. (Anton coughing) (ominous music intensifying) (Anton coughing) (fire whooshing) (explosion rumbling) (gentle music) - Brought your lunch. - That's a light sandwich. - I owe you big. - Yeah, you do. (ominous music) (melancholic piano music) (door knocking) - Hi. - [Officer] Candice Knight? - [Candice] Yeah, what up? - I'm Sydney Constable Charlie Parker. This is my partner, Evan Moore. - What can I do for you? - Unfortunately, we're here to inform you that your stepfather's body has been found this morning and we'll need you to come down to the station this evening to identify the body. - Okay, all right. Yeah. Okay. What, what's... What is... Is there anything you can tell me? - Not at this stage. As more information comes to hand, we'll keep you posted. - Okay, that's really, yeah. - We're really sorry, you have our condolences. - Thank you. I just need like a second. - [Charlie] Sure, of course. - Thank you very much. Thanks. (foreboding music) I can't believe we did it. He's actually gone. - Yep. And he's never coming back. All right, let's go car shopping. - Hey, you. - Hey. - So, who's the pretty lady? - She's special. - Aren't they all. (Jake chuckling) Make sure you bring her back in one piece. You're not insured. - Okay, of course, you can trust me. - Okay? You better not keep the pretty lady waiting. (pleasant instrumental music) (engine rumbling) (tires screeching) (melancholic music) (Celine laughing) - Stop it! I'll get you! (Jake laughing) I love you, Jake. - You too, babe.

Okay. Yeah, okay, all right. Time to move into plan B now, babe. (foreboding music) - Nope. - Oh. He's in. Sorry, I didn't get you one. I wasn't sure you'd be in or not. - It's all good. - You okay? - Engagement is off, so I moved out. - I'm so sorry to hear. - Well, it's been brewing for awhile, so. - Still, it's gotta hurt. I mean, you've been a ghost lately. What's news? - Well if I told you I'm seeing someone new, you'd probably think I was lying, or rebounding. - Oh, wait. Not Mrs. Doggy Scratch Face. - No. She's nice though. So what have you been up to lately? (ominous music) - We did it, we did it, okay. Everything's here, everything, okay? Put it under the bed, don't tell anyone, all right? So what's? - [Tonina] Has everything you need, everything. - Okay. Gotta go to the club. I'll call you, okay? - Okay. - All right. Love you, bye. (foreboding music) (melancholic string music) (Jake knocking) - Jake. - Hey. So? - Oh, come in, come in. - So where's Candice? - She'll be back later. We can start the party without her, it's fine. - Party? - Oh, you didn't hear? She got the goods. I mean, the inheritance from Anton. - What inheritance? - Maybe I wasn't supposed to say anything. Come on, drink. - Maybe we should wait for Candice. - No, no, it's all good. She told me to keep you company until later. - And when's that gonna be? - Late, late. (ominous music) (faint beat music) Oh, I love this song. So, I've seen the way you look at me, you know? - What do you mean? Oh no, wait, Candice is gonna kill us. - No, it's all right, it's fine. - It's fine, what do you mean? - Oh, you don't know? - Know what? - She's bi, I'm poly. (faint beat music) - Oh, now wait.

Yeah, okay, all right. Time to move into plan B now, babe. - [Ayla] This is her taking a large amount of goods from a safety deposit box at the bank. And this is her talking on the phone to her girlfriend. - Which girlfriend? - [Ayla] And this is her arriving home and handing her the suitcase with the goods to keep it safe, I'm presuming. - [Jake] Shit, that's Tonina. - We fucking did it, we did it. Everything is in here, everything, okay? Put it under your bed, hide it. - [Tonina] Okay. That's everything you need. - Everything. Okay. Let me go to the club, do my thing.

(ominous music) - So that's it, I'm fucked. - Not necessarily. She's tying up one more loose end at the club where she works. If you go now, you can catch her. - I swear to God, you're a friggin' lucky charm. You're a goddamn rabbit's foot. I owe you big. All right, I'll make a move. I'll buzz you later. Standby. Wait for me. (ominous tempo music) - Excuse me, can I help you? - Yeah, I'm hoping so. I'm looking for Candice, is she in? - Sorry, she's not in. (phone ringing) Listen, we're closed.

(foreboding music) - I fucking trusted you. - Jake, what's going on? - No. Don't you dare. - Okay. - Hey, what are you doing in here? Get out, it's trespassing. I'm gonna call the cops. - Wait, wait, we can talk about this. What is it that you want? (ominous music) No, that's not for you. - I rescued you that day. I left my fiance for you. I fucking killed... I fucking killed someone for you. You get it? - Jake, I'm sorry. - No, no, no, no, sorry's not gonna cut it. (punch thudding) - Elvis has left the building. - What do you want from me? - I just wanted your love. But as for the way I feel about you now. - Jake. - I mean, who the hell are you anyway? Really. - Wait. - Who are you? (ominous music) Good timing. That's not what I think it is, is it? - [Candice] Tonina! - [Tonina] Yeah? - Jesus, what the hell happened? - Some crazy bitch came in, we got into a fight. (Tonina groaning) I think I need to go to the hospital. - What girl? - I don't know. We got into a scuffle and this fell out of her pocket. (ominous music) - Where's the suitcase, babe? - It's gone. - What'd you say? - The bitch took it. - Fuck! - Wait, I need help! Fuck. (sinister music) - Just take it all, Jake. Get out of town, make a run for it, leave. Just start fresh and do whatever. - Well, I guess you found your new profession anyway, haven't you? (somber piano music) - What's this for? - That's for being you. - This is goodbye? - You'll always be my rabbit's foot. (gentle piano music) - Gonna be okay? - You know what to do. You're gonna make a great PI. (gentle piano music) - I'm gonna miss him. (phone ringing) - Hey, listen man, whoa, whoa, whoa, don't hang up.

I just wanted to say thanks. - Wow. Okay. - Oh, and check your mailbox in the next couple of days. You might have a little something there for you. - Peace be with you, Jake. You know where to find me, my brother. - Over and out. - This fucking guy. - What on earth's happened to you? You look like hell, honey. - Got into a bitch fight.
