Well, that's what I've been thinking about all day. I could ask my dad, but there's just no way. I thought about asking Lloyd for an advance, but you know how he is. Yeah. So that only leaves one thing. I'm gonna rob this place. Yeah, right. No way. No fucking way. Lloyd finds one bill missing, and he's gonna fire me, and I need this job. My sister's sick. You know that. I know, and I'm sorry, but I don't have a choice. Well... Take it on your own shift. I can't. She needs the money tomorrow. Why? Because her parents are gonna be gone all day. It's the only time she can go. Well, she's just gonna have to wait. You're not taking any money from here tonight, and that's that. I don't believe this. Please, Buzzy, just give me the money? You gonna shoot me, huh? Buzzy. Would you shoot Cheri if I needed money? Oh, come on. Why do you always have to do this? Well, would you? Just tell Lloyd you were robbed. Is that so hard? I'm a bad liar. But you won't be lying. It's not like he's got surveillance or anything. He's been looking for a reason to fire me anyway. Are you gonna give me the money or not? Look, you know I wanna help you. Don't ask me to do this. Melinda's got no insurance. She needs every dollar we've got. Just-- come on. Just-- no. You do what you gotta do, but I'm not gonna open up this drawer. God. Damn it. Look at me. Why, so you can shoot me in the face? Come on. Just look at me. Goddamn it, you're so stubborn!

Buzzy, I am saving your job. Think about it. The cops are probably on their way already. How much cash is in the register? 1,200 and change. Duffy, no. You're not thinking. You're not thinking things clearly here, OK? This way, you get to keep your job, and then $700 goes straight to Melinda. DUFFY: Good. No, just take it all. I'll get mine later. Wait. One thing you have to do for me before you go. What? Shoot me. What?! Lloyd will know I'm lying in a second. But if you shoot me, I'm hurt, he can't ask any questions. Are you out of your mind? No, I'm serious, Duffy. I need this job. I can't! Duffy? No. No. I'll tell Cheri about that time last summer. You wouldn't. All right. All right. Um, wait. No. Go over here.
