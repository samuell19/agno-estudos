Order arms! After eight long years. The curtain of separation is about to be drawn. The military scene closed forever. You have been valiant soldiers. You have met every hardship. Even the extremes of hunger and nakedness. With extraordinary patience and fortitude. The unbiased voice of the free citizens of the United States. Has promised you a just reward. The money due to you brave men. Must inevitably be paid. You are going forth to mingle with the great body of the community. Some of you, through the pursuit of commerce. Some to the cultivation of the soil. Others, to the fisheries. And some of you, actuated by the spirit of adventure .. Will push on to the vast, unknown regions of the West. It is my earnest opinion. That upon your patriotic support of the Union. And the federal government. Our future existence as a nation .. depends. And so .. Your General offers his prayer to the God of armies. That ample justice be done to you all. You who have secured great blessings for others. And bid you all. An affectionate. A long farewell. Tell Colonel Hamilton I should like to see him. General. - Oh, there you are. Well, I've parted with the men. Yes .. I heard you. It was a hard job saying goodbye. But not as hard as it will be to part with you, Alexander. No-one will ever know what you've meant to me in this campaign. You've given me a kind of support. Not only as a soldier but .. your advice. It's hard to put these things into words. But I thank you for it. And I love you for it. General. Well, I suppose you'll be going back to the law? I am not so sure. What are you going to do? Go back to Mount Vernon as fast as my legs will carry me. Home. And a garden. And a river running along at the foot of my ground. Thank heaven the war is over. Over. Well, we've just signed a treaty of peace. Don't tell me there's another fight ahead. You now that for you and for me .. The struggle is only just beginning. For you, perhaps. But my work is finished. While the war was on. The 13 States were held together by a common cause. But now, the war is over. And we shall have 13 jealous States ready to fly for another's throats. Ha, that's true. Soldiers have to be paid. You just promised them their money. Who will pay them? Each State will try to shift the responsibility on to the other. America will be without credit and without honor among nations. Unless it has a great leader who has gained the country's confidence. General Washington, there is only one man for the post. You always were the darnedest devil for facing facts, Alexander. Won't you let me die in peace? General, I won't let you die at all. Then you must stand by me. For I don't know the way to fight politicians. We are both tired of fighting. But we can neither of us give up .. Until this country has paid its debts. At home .. and abroad. What good did the war do us? Independence .. liberty. Ha .. things are worse than ever. Where is the Army pay? This is all I got. "The State of South Carolina promises to pay .." "Harvey Taylor the sum of one hundred dollars." That's eight years ago and they ain't paid yet. Here is the same thing from the State of Connecticut. Those certificates today are not worth ten cents on the open market. Why hasn't Washington kept his word? He promised we'd be paid. That was before they made him President. It ain't Washington. It's Hamilton. What do you mean? Washington does what Hamilton tells him. They are both crooked if you ask me. - I agree. Hello, Reynolds. - Hello, Zachary Whalen. You'd agree with anyone who was willing to buy you a drink. Melissa, some ale. Alexander Hamilton has been made Secretary of the Treasury. And he don't do a darned thing. He did one darn good thing. You had a job in the Treasury and he gave you the sack for dishonesty. Now I can explain that. Why don't Hamilton see that these certificates are paid? All he does is sit in his office and put down figures. What good will that do us? There ain't enough money in the Treasury to pay us. Well, why ain't there? Because the Senators are always fighting against one another. Alexander Hamilton and George Washington .. Are the only two men with brains in the country. Oh. What about Jefferson? - And Monroe, and Senator Roberts? They'll be another bloody revolution in this country before long. And it won't be against a foreign power. - Shut up, Reynolds. Where were you during the war? You never did a day's fighting in your life. Oh .. Well, there is no use arguing about it. I object to Alexander Hamilton's high-handed ways. Who is he to call us all here together today? Senator Roberts. We should have refused to come. - Senator Monroe. We cannot afford to ignore Hamilton's importance. Although his energies are perhaps, misdirected. Mr Jefferson. Senator Roberts is right. Hamilton has his finger in every pie. And we don't want any more Kings in this country. Kings. Who wishes to be King? - George Washington does. And Alexander Hamilton wants to be Prime Minister. Wants to be. He is Prime Minister at this very moment. Prime Minister of America. Ha! Come, come. Don't let's lose our tempers. Mr Hamilton no doubt called this meeting for more debate on his Assumption Bill. That Bill is an outrage! Let every State pay its own debts. Why should North Carolina pay the debts of Connecticut? We've always blocked that Bill, and will continue to block it to the last ditch. Yes .. Hamilton's efforts are dangerous. Because they are always directed towards a centralization of the government. And that would lead to monarchy. The very thing we fought to get away from. Ah, there you are, Mr Hamilton. Gentlemen, I trust I'm not late. It's exceedingly kind of you to respond so quickly .. Cut the fol-de-roll and get down to business. Mr Roberts, I'm afraid I interrupted you. Won't you sit down? That is the chair that President Washington always sits in. Gentlemen, what I want .. - We know what you want. Your game is to keep on strengthening the federal government .. Until the States shall eventually have no rights at all. My game is to establish the credit of this country .. So that it can trade with other nations. And it is a game which requires at least four players. Do you know, Mister Secretary of the Treasury .. I am opposed to any attempt at centralisation of power. And for the same reason .. I'm opposed to your scheme for the establishment of a national bank. National bank? Rubbish. A wild idea. And besides, it is not constitutional. - Well, it's all part of my policy. What is your policy? I can tell you in one word, Senator Roberts. Honesty. You may remember that line in your copybook: "Honesty is the best policy." I mean, in your college days. Before you became a politician. I never went to college. We can't all be aristocrats. Mr Hamilton. I stand on the platform of the rights of man. The rights of the individual. The rights of the individual States. "Honesty is the best policy" applies to States .. Just as surely as it does to individuals. It is a policy for the United States to pay its debts. The gravest danger that threatens America today. Rests with the men trying to centralize the power of the United States. How will we pay our debts without a central government? This country has no credit abroad. It's the laughing stock of other nations. Its paper isn't worth five cents in the dollar. Why? Because as a nation, we are not to be trusted. We haven't paid the merchants who gave us credit during the war. We haven't paid our soldiers who fought for our liberties. - Soldiers? This country will put a stop to George Washington's coddling of the army. He treats them as if they were his own relatives. I'm sure you're not comfortable in that chair. No, I'm not comfortable in this chair. I wasn't made to occupy a throne. Virginia paid her soldiers. That saved the honor of Virginia, but not the honor of the nation. Has South Carolina paid her soldiers? Has Rhode Island? That's no affair of Virginia. We're not going to pick the pockets of one State to pay the debts of another. Each State fought for the common good. Every man must be paid. Gentlemen, we are building a nation. Let us build strongly. Let us build on a foundation of honor. You plead for the honor of the nation. I plead for the rights of the individual. Do you realize the rights of the people are at stake? The only safety for any people .. Is in a government that can pay the nation's debts. You mean, by passing your Assumption Bill? Yes, gentlemen. That was my object in calling you together today. With your permission then, Mr Secretary of the Treasury .. I will withdraw. - And I. I am bound to confess. That I consider your attempt to force this Bill .. Nothing more than a trick to give greater power to the central body. And to ruthlessly crush the freedom of the States. At least, Mr Secretary of State .. I have had the pleasure of listening with admiration to your eloquence. Aye, you're right there. Tom Jefferson is an all-fired good talker. You know, Hamilton. There are some things about this Bill of yours that ain't so bad. Coming from you, Senator Roberts, I consider that a compliment. I don't know. I might be persuaded to change my vote. You'd like my vote, wouldn't you, Colonel? I should indeed. And I should like your influence with your party. You know. I can swing enough votes to put your Bill through. And I'll do it. But on one condition. Don't make it hard for me. I won't make it hard for you. I'll make it easy. Now .. in that copybook of yours, when you was at college. Do you remember that line about .. "A fair exchange is no robbery"? I'm not sure that you and I were brought up on the same copybook. Now listen to me, Hamilton. The President always asks your advice. If you will say that Tim Roberts is the right man for Minister to France. Tim Roberts will put through your Bill for you. Minister to France? Oh, I see. You don't think I'm good enough. I don't think you're fitted for it. - Why not? With the revolution going on over there. The task of our Minister is probably the most delicate .. Oh, I ain't delicate enough? What else? You're not making it easy for me. - I want your reasons. I prefer not to give them. - What have you against me? Speak up. - Everything! I know your record during the war. Dishonest business. You compelled me to speak. The United States Minister to France .. Must be a man of unblemished reputation. Alright, Mr Hamilton. You're a fighter, ain't you. Well, so am I. From now on, you're fighting me! Get your Bill through if you can. Go on. Senator. Remember .. your copybook. Don't forget .. there is honor among thieves. Here is Senator Roberts. He's a friend of the people. Fellow citizens. You are right. I am your friend. And I'm going to do everything in my power .. to help you. I've just been talking to our Secretary of the Treasury. I didn't get much satisfaction out of him. Hamilton is an .. aristocrat! Down with Hamilton. Down with him. What made you do that? Senator Roberts said you wouldn't help us. He told us. Were you a soldier? - Yes. You nearly got me. He must have been a sharpshooter. Were any of you men at Monmouth or Trenton? Yes, I was there. We pretty near got licked. Were any of you at Valley Forge? Yes, plenty. I nearly froze to death. Froze my foot. You trusted Washington. Through those days of cold and hunger. You must trust him now. He's still your friend. Just as he was then. - He's right. If any man had good cause for complaint. Washington was the first to listen to him. And give him justice. Wasn't he? A cheer for Washington! Let him go. A cheer for Hamilton! Hello, Zekial. Why .. Master Hamilton. You've come at last. You'd better don't let Miss Betsy see you. You scallywag. What do you mean? Where is your Mistress? - Bless my soul. She's looking out of the window for you most of the time. Am I late, Zekial? - You sure is. You was more than late for tea, Master Hamilton. Is that you, Amiable? - Here I am, Betsy. Zekial is detaining me. Betsy. - Amiable. I'm afraid I'm late, darling. You've got too much to do. That's what's the matter. Is the foreign mail in? Yes. But there is no news of sister. No news is good news. Well .. how did the conference go off? A grand success. Why, I am so glad. Yes. Everybody talked and nobody said anything. Nothing was done and everybody was pleased with themselves. Oh, Alexander. A great deal of mud was thrown at me .. but only one stone. And I dodged everything. What do you mean? Not really a stone? Well, it might have been a brick. You see, when things are flung at the Assumption Bill .. They have to hit me first. Oh .. then we had music. Music? - Yes. Jefferson sang to us. Sang? Well .. he didn't exactly sing. But he made fine oratorical speeches. And he listened to the music of his voice. How long is this going to last? When am I really going to see something of you in our own home? Very soon dear, I hope. Just as soon as I can get those thirteen States to hang together. I'm not complaining. But I sometimes wish you didn't care quite so much for your country. Betsy. Zekial, where is your Mistress? Having tea, General. - Alright, Zekial. I'll go straight in. Betsy. Why father, what is the matter? I've had news from London. - It's Angelica? Tell me. Yes Betsy, your sister is worse. She needs you. Her husband is there with her. - Yes, but he writes me: "She's always calling for Betsy." Alexander, I must go. My dear. - Yes, I must go to her. When is the next boat? - Tomorrow morning. The William Pitt sails at early tide. Oh. Come and help me pack. That's my Betsy. Excuse me, father-in-law. That's my Betsy. Come along, father. Can I help you, father-in-law? - I'm alright. A fine looking ship, isn't it. Yes, beautiful. Then I think you'd better go aboard. Are you sure you've got enough food to last your Mistress the whole trip? Yes, sir. Them's the hams .. The smoked tongue, the dried beef, and them's the best biscuits. Where is the tea? - Right in here, General. Miss Betsy sure loves her tea. Aye. Be careful. Here, let me take care of those eggs. Thank heaven they're not broken. Them eggs won't break, General. Won't break? - No, sir. Because they is boiled. Goodbye, Zekial. You'll take good care of your Master won't you. Indeed I will. And you take good care of yourself, Miss Betsy. Goodbye, Betsy. Goodbye, father. I .. I'd better get down that gangplank. Betsy. This is from our garden. I picked them this morning. Rosemary. Yes, Betsy. For remembering. Sweet. All visitors ashore. I tell you one thing, Tom Jefferson. You've a fight on to get the capital of the United States for the South. Yes. And I'm afraid it's a losing fight. I hope the South don't count on it too much. Well, Monroe will be able to tell us. If that coach ever gets here. Here it is now. Late, as usual. My luggage. Well, howdy, Jim. - Hello, Monroe. Come on, let's sit here. Well, what's the feeling about the site of the capital? Yes, yes. What news? The news? The news is, I want a drink. - Yes, of course. What's the feeling of the Southern States? I've been bumped and shaken over 700 miles of the worst roads in existence. I've visited every town. Every plantation of any importance. Brandy. - Yes, yes. There is just subject on everybody's lips. That is that the capital of these United States has to be located in the South. I thought so. - It will be a fight to get it. Well it will be your last fight Tom Jefferson, if you don't. You don't know how they feel about it down there. They don't care about anything else. And they don't talk about anything else. If you don't swing this, Jefferson .. - Our goose is cooked. I've got to swing it. But we can't get it without Hamilton. A fine chance we have of getting him. He'll stand out for New York of course. But we've got to get the capital for the South. We've pledged ourselves to our party. And if we don't get it, we're done for. I've heard them talk. And I know. Hamilton would have great influence with Congress. I think we'll have to try a little .. persuasion. What? Go begging to Hamilton? Well, perhaps we'd better pay him a friendly call? Well, count me out. I guess it's our only hope. Hamilton's word would have great influence with the President. If we can only make the people believe that the Secretary of the Treasury .. Ain't been playing fair with the nation's money. Why, we'd have the whole country in our pockets. He's honest, Senator. We've tested his honesty. Yes, we've attacked his honesty from every angle. He's always beaten us. Well, you go if you want to. It don't suit me to go begging or paying friendly calls on Alexander Hamilton. So good day, Tom Jefferson. Good day, Monroe. Then you and I will call on him today. A friendly call. You know, Senator .. More flies are caught with molasses than with vinegar. Zekial. Yes sir, Master Hamilton. I is wise. Remember, I'm out. Yes, sir. You is out. Good afternoon, Master Schuyler. - Hello, Zekial. Where is your Master? Master Hamilton? Why, he is out. I'm in, Zekial. I'm in. Come in, General. Why, you rascal. You said he was out. He done tell me he's out when he's in and in when he's out. I don't know where he is. General, it's good to see you. First of all, what news of Betsy? Her letter gives little hope .. Of her being home for several months yet. Angelica is still improving? - Yes, but slowly. I miss Betsy. You should get out more. Enjoy yourself. Let someone else run the country for a change. By the way. I met Jefferson and Monroe this morning. They asked me to tell you that they'll call on you today for a friendly chat. A friendly chat? That sounds fishy. They want something. From what Tom Jefferson said, I think it's about the location of the capital. Oh, the Residence Bill. Well, where do they want the capital? In Jefferson's parlor, I suppose? Exactly. They want the capital of these United States to be in the South. Well, why not? You mean to say you'd let the capital of the United States go to the South? Where do you think it should be? Where? Why, Albany of course. Your home town. In your parlor, I suppose. No, no General. Certainly not Albany. Why, "certainly not Albany"? I suppose you want it in New York? - No. Where in heaven's name do you want it then? Anywhere that is handy to get at. So long as we have the right men inside. Seriously .. I think it should be an entirely .. new city. That's an original idea. Where? Oh .. somewhere central. On the Potomac. - Ah, the Potomac. You think it should be in the North. Why? Why? I'll tell you. In the first place, all our country's great and glorious and traditions .. Cluster about the North. - There is some truth in that. It was here in Philadelphia that the Declaration Of Independence was signed. So it was. It was in New York where Washington took the oath of office. It was in New York where the government had its beginning. And as for Albany. Why Albany commands the commerce of the four corners of the earth. And there isn't a plain bit of reason why the South should have it anyway. I declare Jefferson and Senator Monroe calling to see you. Show them in. And you'll give them the capital of the United States without a struggle? General. I wonder if they feel as strongly about the location of the capital as you do. Why any man with a grain of .. - General .. I'm going to send you outside on to the balcony to cool down. Father-in-law. If I could only get hold of Jefferson and Monroe. What, to back your Assumption Bill? - Yes. If you could only get hold of the moon. Outside, and keep quiet. I declare Jefferson and Senator Monroe, sir. Mr Jefferson. Senator Monroe. How do, Hamilton. - Won't you sit down. Mr Hamilton. We've come to have a little chat with you. I am at your service. If our business is private I'll mention that General Schuyler is on the balcony. Oh, not at all. I've already mentioned to him. That we wished to speak to you about the location of the capital. You know the Resident's Bill must be voted on without delay. I understand that an immediate decision is necessary. I will not disguise from you .. That I consider the geographical position of the capital .. A very vital matter. A very vital matter. We know you will have great influence with the President. In arriving at a decision. That decision, gentlemen, is a very grave and serious matter. But I think we should have no difficulty in reaching an agreement. I am pleased to find you are willing to meet us in the matter. I've gone into the matter very seriously. And I've come to the conclusion. That there is only one possible location for the capital. That is? - Albany. Oh. I think I heard my father-in-law call. Albany? That old Dutch town? - Why Albany? Because it commands the commerce of the four corners of the earth. I'm afraid you don't consider .. - I know. Much may be said in favor of New York and Philadelphia. You talk as if Albany, New York and Philadelphia were the only choices. You have a place in mind? Hasn't the South as much claim as the North? - Certainly not, sir. The South could not possibly be considered. What's your reason for the North except you're a northerner yourself? Why .. gentlemen. All our country's great and glorious traditions .. Cluster about the North. It was here in Philadelphia .. That was signed that immortal document from your hand, Mr Jefferson .. The Declaration Of Independence. - What's that to do with it? It was in New York that Washington took his oath of office. It was there that the government had its beginning. And there is nothing, no reason on earth why the South should have it anyway. The South will put up a fight for it. - Is that your final word, Mr Hamilton? My decision on this matter .. Is just as irrevocable as your decision regarding my Assumption Bill. Excuse me. I am sure I heard the General calling. Did you hear what he said? Do you think it's a bait? He means he'll support us if we back his Bill. We can't do that .. it's against all our principles. We've got to do it. We dare not let the capital go to the North. The whole party will be against us. Forgive me for leaving you. Although I fear gentlemen, our interview is at an end. But Mr Hamilton. I've always found that in settling arguments. It is necessary to give and take. Precisely. To give the least and take the most. Now, in regard to the capital. I have a proposal to make. Won't you sit down? Since we cannot agree upon the selection of a city. Why not build us a new city? Founded on the ideals of liberty and fraternity. Why .. that's certainly an original idea. A new city. On the Hudson. - No, not on the Hudson. On the Potomac. Half way between the North and the South. I am sorry, Mr Jefferson. But my decision is irrevocable. I think you said. As irrevocable as our decision about your Bill. Did I? I think I did. Suppose we make a .. concession. Strike a bargain, you mean? Why .. I wouldn't care to use that word, Mr Hamilton. No? Then we won't use it. We'll call it a "concession". Suppose we .. Pass your Bill .. In return for the capital? Gentlemen. This is really a surprising proposal. I'm afraid I need time to think that over. You're a quick thinker when you like. - Yes. When I like the proposal. But it seems I get the worst of the bargain. Or "concession". We offer you what you've fought for years. Give me a week to think it over? - Impossible, Mr Hamilton. Three days? - No. This must be decided now. We've pledged our word to the Southern States. You've pledged your word? I was not aware of that. In that case, gentlemen. I shall feel compelled .. to agree. - Good. Shall we put it in writing? - No. Our oral pledge is sufficient. Your word is your bond. In fact gentlemen, I would rather take your word .. Than the bond of almost any State in the Union. Good day, Mr Hamilton. - Good day, Mr Jefferson. Senator. Alexander .. aren't you a wizard! No, General .. but I'm learning to be a politician. Keep quiet there, will you. I'm selling state securities for the price of the printing. Sit down. How can you be selling when there are no buyers? Ah .. you don't know the value of them. Don't any of you gentlemen want to make some easy money? Here is a $100 state security going to the highest bidder. What State? - South Carolina. I'm selling, I'm selling, I'm selling. Where did you get all this paper, Reynolds? Well, if ain't Senator .. - Shut your mouth. Where did you get it from? From the poor soldiers. You're a bad egg, ain't you. A good family, a good education. But you're a yellow dog. I've been unfortunate. - I know. You were found out. Lots of people are unfortunate that way. You ain't fond of Alexander Hamilton, are you. No, I ain't. And you'd do any darned thing for a ten-dollar bill, wouldn't you? Well, just as long as it wasn't anything dishonorable, Mr Roberts. If there was only a way to shake the people's faith in him. Pretty hard to shake the people's faith in Hamilton. I know it. See, Mr Roberts. Have you ever thought about ..? Sit down. Excuse me, Master Hamilton. But it's right now ten o'clock. Well, what of it? Why, you ain't had no dinner and now you ain't touched no supper neither. Well, I've got a difficult job on here. Trying to make bricks without straw. Bricks? I certainly do see why you might want to miss supper, Master. [ Door knocks ] Is you in or is you out? Oh well .. I suppose I'm in. Yes, sir. You is in. Monsieur Hamilton, he is still working? - He sure is, your honor. Mr Count Talleyrand, sir. Ah, bonsoir, mon ami. Monsieur Talleyrand. This is indeed a pleasure. If I say I am delighted to find you at all, I tell only half the truth. Why, what is the mystery? My dear friend, Hamilton. All the time I am a visitor in your country. When I am in trouble, I come to you for advice and you have never failed me. Tonight, I come to give advice. What have I been doing? - Too much. Today I meet General Schuyler and he tells me he can do nothing with you. I promise him I will call. I come here at 10 o'clock. And I find you are still working. Now, I will drag you out on a little spree. Why, Talleyrand, you surprise me. We've always met on the gravest matters of state. And now, in the midst of your own revolution in France. You propose a little "spree". - Oui. Zekial! Glasses. - Yes sir, Mr Hamilton. I'm going to give you a toast. Don't you drink that on an empty stomach, Master Hamilton. Or it will go straight to your head. To George Washington. The first American. A great big heart. A great big soul. - And a great big nose. Ah, c'est bon, sir. - Now then. Sit down. No, no. No, Alexander. No more work tonight. Come with me. A little spree, eh? What do you call a little spree? A little spree. Ah, your American girls. So .. ravissante. I know. I know Mrs Hamilton is charming, but she is away. She is away so long and you are lonely. Yes. I am lonely. - A little spree. You think I deserve it, eh? - We are all but human. A little spree will do you good. Come .. come. No, no, no. No? I cannot tempt you? - I'm afraid you might. That's why I say .. Goodnight. Merci. - Bonsoir. What's the matter, Zekial? - A little spree. I figured it ought to do you sort of good, sir. Zekial! Well, if I'd been working the same as you .. I reckon I'd like a little spree myself. You old reprobate! At your age? Well sir, that am the only thing that would prevent it. Get out! Go home and go to bed immediately. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. [ Door knocks ] What is it? Is this Mr Alexander Hamilton's house? Yes. What do you want? - I want to see him. Won't it do tomorrow? - Oh no, I must see him tonight. Well .. alright, wait a moment. Come in. Are you Alexander Hamilton? Yes. - Oh. It's very late isn't it. Were you just going to bed? I think I was. Oh, then I ought not to have disturbed you. It was mighty nice of you to let me in. What do you want? I want money. Money? Why have you come to me? Why, I'm an American. I thought it was the place of the Secretary of the Treasury to help me. But .. My father was in the commissary department during the war. Was he? Won't you sit down? Yes. Mr Lewis his name was. Well .. What do you want the money for? To run away. Run away? Yes. From my husband. Your husband? But you are very young. I am nearly thirty. I don't look it, do I. Oh .. he's been nothing to me for a long time but .. Tonight he came to my lodgings where I've been living and .. Struck me. So I thought if you could give me the money .. That tomorrow I would go to New York. And tonight? Oh, I can go back to my lodgings. He won't come there again tonight. What did you say your name was? Lewis? No. That was my father's name. Maria is my first name. At home I was always called Joy. Joy? Yes. But I haven't had much joy since I was married. Oh, but I want it. I want joy and happiness. Things will look brighter tomorrow. No .. I've waited for year for things to look brighter tomorrow. I'm afraid you're very tired. I am. And I've had nothing since morning. Haven't you? Well. Why, neither have I. Nothing to eat since morning? Why .. you poor thing. Why, you've all sorts of things here. - Would you like something? No thank you. And wine. - Have a glass of wine. Oh yes, I love wine. Oh. Oh but I don't think I should have had it. I've had nothing to eat. In that case I believe it goes straight to the head. Aren't you going to have one? - Yes, I'm going to have one. Here is wishing that joy .. May come back into your life. Do you know what it is to be lonely? I do. I've been very lonely sometimes. I believe you are lonely now. Have you nobody here to talk to? Nobody. But you. And that is why I am going to send you away. But first of all, how much money do you need? I'm afraid I ought not to have come to you. Well, I want you to understand. The Treasury doesn't give money to individuals. I'm not a rich man but I'm very sorry for you. And I'm going to let you have .. Fifty dollars out of my own purse. Oh, thank you. But you must regard it as a personal loan. It had nothing to do with the treasury. You are certainly very good to me. And now .. Oh .. I see .. You don't think it's right my being here. Well .. - I'll go. Have you far to go? - Oh no. It's quite close. I .. Why .. I don't know what's come over me. I feel so faint. Have some water. Drink this. It must have been the wine. Feel my face. How it's burning. But you're feeling better, aren't you? - Yes. Yes. Just let me stay a moment. There. Now I'll go. You're very trusting. Not always .. but I'm human. I think I'd better see you to your door. Oh, will you? Chilly, isn't it. - Yes, the night air. Here. Put this round you. Oh .. One of yours? Yes .. it's very big for you. It's very cosy. May I take your arm? This is where I live. On the second floor. Goodbye. - Goodbye. You're feeling much better, aren't you? - Oh yes. I'll wait until you're safely in. Thank you. It is wonderful to have been with someone who was kind to me. Goodnight. - Goodnight. Goodnight. Goodnight. Oh, I have your cloak. You got in, Reynolds. - Yes, I managed it. I look quite the gentleman, don't I. There is Hamilton now. Finishing his minuet. Do your job. Make him dance to another tune. Molly, I feel like a bride tonight, with everyone giving me such attention. I wish I could be what you would call .. the best man. To have the honor of kissing the bride. Mrs Bingham, your party is the success of the season. But oh dear me. I must give up these violent dances. Father, you know you love to hold the ladies' hands. If Lady Washington would do me the honor. This is the first time that I have ever been to a dance without my husband. I think I will not dance tonight, General. The President would have been here .. Alexander sent him away. The President did me the honor to agree with me. That the only way to put down the whiskey rebellion in Pennsylvania .. Was to send a strong armed force. And he knew that he was the only man to lead the troops. Except Alexander Hamilton. He has plenty of fighting to do in Philadelphia. For me, I am on the side of the whiskey rebellion. This is a free country. Why tax the whiskey? Mon dieu. It was that that started our revolution in France. Viscount, you don't drink whiskey in France. It isn't the whiskey, it's the mixing that caused the trouble. Mixing? What did they mix with it? Politics, ma'am. Hello, Mr Hamilton. Could I talk with you for a moment? What is it? Why? My name is Reynolds. I used to be employed in the Treasury. Oh yes, I remember. I want you to take me back again, Mr Hamilton. I have nothing to say to you. I see Roberts is here. - He's avoiding us. He evidently resents our supporting Hamilton. Roberts resents everything except Roberts. I must admit. Our going over to the Assumption Bill was awkward. Our change of front will be difficult to explain to the people. Tom Jefferson, you can explain away anything. Give you a pen and ink, there isn't your equal for that in the universe. Dear, can't we slip away? I don't want all these people. I want you. Well, as this is given in your honor. I'm afraid we can't slip away. We might make a grand exit. We'll appeal to our hostess. Oh Mrs Hamilton, do tell us about your adventures. Going all the way to England. We're going to steal her from you, Mr Hamilton. Well, what do you want to know? Tell us about your journey. They say that our fast sailing ships are wonderful. You just get on the boat in Philadelphia and whizz, in 6 weeks you're in London. You'd better listen to me, Mr Hamilton. What is it you want? That's rather private. This is a strange place to choose for a private conversation. Maybe it is a strange matter I have to talk about. There is a quiet corner. Well .. what is it? I'm hard up, Mr Hamilton. I've got to have money. - What's that to me? I want you to give me back my old job in the Treasury. You have been tried. You are lazy. You are dishonest. There's no place for you in any government office. Maybe you'll find a place for me, and find it quick. I think you're drunk. - Do you? Do you remember a lady who called on you one night? Quite late. You took her home. She told you her first name was Maria. She didn't tell you her married name. Her married name was "Reynolds", Mr Hamilton. "Reynolds"? - Yes. My wife. You took advantage of her being alone. I see. You came into her life .. - What do mean, "came into her life"? You know I've never seen her since. - But you sent her money. I'll prove it. Are you going to give me the job? - No! Maybe you'll wish you had. What do you mean to do? Well first of all, I should consider it my duty to tell Mrs Hamilton. How much do you want? Well, I don't want to be hard on you, Mr Hamilton. But if you give me a hundred dollars. Here is my address. I'll send it to you. Would you excuse us, Molly? I'm rather tired. Why of course you are, my dear. Alexander has disappeared. I've looked everywhere for him. Why Alexander, here you are. Molly will excuse us. Molly, I can't tell you the pleasure you've given us tonight. You are leaving? So soon? Au revoir. I sail tomorrow for France. And when I get back to my country and its revolution I will say .. In America, romance is not dead. For there is Alexander Hamilton. And there is his Betsy. [ Singing: ] Why Alexander. What is happening? How did you manage to tear yourself away from work at this hour in the morning? I heard you singing. And I couldn't resist coming to see if you looked as pretty as you sounded. Amiable .. play truant today. Let's have this day together. Take me shopping. But who is to look after my shop, The Treasury? Shut it up. Let's pretend it's my birthday. And I declare this a public holiday. What are we to shop with? - I know money is scarce. But we won't spend much. Father says you've no right to go on working for the government. Your grateful country pays you $3,500 a year as Secretary of the Treasury. And you know you could earn $20,000 a year in private practice. Well, after tomorrow. When my Assumption Bill goes through, we'll think about it. But today. It shall be your birthday and we'll shut up shop. You're a darling. Alexander. There is Roberts and Monroe, both come to see you. I met them on the doorstep and I put them in your study. Now, isn't that devilish? What do you think they want? I'm afraid that's just what I must find out. Well I give you ten minutes, no longer. Ten minutes. Come along father-in-law. Help me to get rid of them. Gentlemen, you honor me. Why, General Schuyler was just congratulating me on your cooperation .. In connection with my Assumption Bill. Yes. I trust we shall have no reason to alter our decision on that point. I too trust you will not find it expedient to break your word. It isn't a matter of breaking words, it's a matter of public opinion. I was not alluding to you, Senator Roberts. Everybody knows that you would never be guilty of a breach of faith. Unless it were made absolutely worth your while. Hmm. That remark was uncalled for, sir. True. Tell me Senator, what have you called for? We have called, Mr Hamilton on business of a private character. Mr Jefferson, sir. You must excuse me Mr Hamilton, but .. I received a note from Senator Monroe. Asking me to meet him here at this hour. I trust I do not intrude. I told Mr Jefferson the business was urgent. Otherwise, I should not have taken the liberty. Gentlemen, pray be seated. Oh. We have recently been annoyed by the receipt .. Of anonymous letters. Threatening exposure of some scandal linked to the Secretary of the Treasury. We have traced these letters to a man named .. Reynolds. Oh yes. James Reynolds. You know him? Yes. This man has placed in my hands certain papers. Which show that he has received from you considerable sums of money. What was that money paid for? May I be allowed to see the documents in question? There's no doubt you paid him the money. There seems to be no doubt about that. We are compelled to ask you why you paid. Who compelled you to do that? - Our sense of duty. Duty to whom? - To the country. To the people. It's not to do with the country or the people. This is my own private affair. We know why you paid him the money. Reynolds told us. - Oh, you know, do you? Then you haven't come for information. But merely for the love of sport. We've got Reynolds' sworn statement. That you paid him money to buy State's certificates at a few cents on a dollar. While you hoodwink us into passing your Bill. Which would compel the government to pay you a hundred cents on the dollar. So. That's what he told you, did he? That's the reason for the whole thing. Senator Roberts, remember you've only Reynolds' word for this. Gentlemen, let's try to be frank with one another. You have come here today. Not because you believe me guilty of this accusation. But because you repent the bargain you made with me to vote for my Bill. You're afraid of your own party. Your courage has failed you. You see this as a tremendous opportunity to free yourselves from your promise. That is the true statement of facts, Mr Jefferson. Whatever you may think to the contrary. You dislike me. You are afraid of me. And this is part of an organised conspiracy to force me to resign. Time and again you're charged me with dishonesty in The Treasury. And time and again I've proved .. That there was no shadow of foundation to your accusation. And you've slunk away, whipped and defeated. And now here you are! Yelping at my heels again. And ready to tear me to pieces. Had I desired to defraud The Treasury. Should I have been driven to the need of un-kennelling Reynolds to assist me? If I thought that you really believed this story. I should not hesitate to give you proof of its falsity. But you know .. that what you accuse me of .. Has no foundation in truth. I admit. That I had transactions. With that man Reynolds. But they were of a private nature. And I swear that my connection with him .. Is in no way bound up with my public office. I make an appeal. To your sense of justice. And I ask you gentlemen. To drop this investigation. If our accusation is false. Why not tell us the facts? Because they would be of no value to you. And would cause great suffering .. To some who are very dear to me. You mean .. it's a domestic affair? In a sense, yes. Something .. that affects your wife? Yes, sir. Something that affects my wife. In that case .. - Mr Hamilton. As a trusted representative of the people .. I feel it my duty to ask you a few questions. Yes? Well, in the first place .. In what way is your wife mixed up with ..? - Stop! There'll be no more of this. I am ashamed of the act that has led to this inquiry. But I am more ashamed of my cowardice in begging for your charity. You shall have the facts. During the absence of my wife abroad. I became intimate with Mrs Reynolds. It doesn't matter how or where. Since that night I have been repeatedly blackmailed by that man, Reynolds. Alexander! - I have no excuse to make. But it is now clear to me. That this whole thing was engineered by certain political opponents. A plot to discredit Washington's administration. And my office. Excuse me gentlemen, but this is my birthday. And I've come to claim my husband. In a few moments, dear. In a few moments, I'll come. I don't think we need ask Mrs Hamilton to withdraw. Our business is over. Is anything the matter, father? - It's alright, my girl. It's alright. I deeply regret you should have been subjected to this. I give you my word that not one syllable shall ever pass my lips. I'm sorry. I was misinformed. I apologise. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I'm not satisfied with this. I won't be muzzled. You must excuse me. But I cannot stand by as Senator Roberts maintains this offensive attitude. And I wish to express my regret. That a representative of the Senate. Should behave in such a deplorable fashion. I take my leave. Well, Jefferson's words don't alter facts. Not with me they don't. Your Bill is coming up tomorrow, ain't it? Now what would you say if the newspapers came out in the morning .. With the story that the Secretary of the Treasury .. Was playing crooked with the nation's money. Is there any danger of the papers getting it? There is more than a danger. The Advertizer has got the story now. And is going to publish it tomorrow unless .. - Unless? Well, unless you deny it. Which you couldn't very well. Because there are the proofs that you paid the money to Reynolds. And you can't explain why. You've got me, haven't you. Now, Mr Hamilton. I you will withdraw your Assumption Bill .. I'll guarantee that the story will not be printed. Alexander, I don't know or care about this false charge brought against you. But you've worked for that Bill for eight years. No-one knows as well as I how hard he has worked. And you must not withdraw it. Well, the Bill is killed, either way. If this story of your being mixed up with this woman comes out .. Ah well, I'm sorry. I .. Well, what's the good of mincing matters? Alexander. Is it true? Betsy. Does anyone else .. know? No. Then it need never .. be known. Then you withdraw your Bill? No! No, I can't do it. I've done with bargains. I've bargained with my conscience for long enough. But I can't stand in the mud and barter America's honor. My Bill stands! Get out and tell your story. And I'll tell mine. What will you tell? - The truth. The whole degrading, sordid truth. In tomorrow's newspaper, I'll publish every fragment of evidence. In connection with my disgrace with this woman. If there is to be dishonor, it shall fall on me. And not on this administration. I'll sacrifice my name. I'll sacrifice my home. But by God, Betsy, I cannot sell my country. "Latest sensation!" "Secretary of the Treasury confesses scandal!" "Latest sensation!" "Secretary of the Treasury confesses scandal!" Hamilton? Well. Who'd have thought Hamilton would have got mixed up in a thing like that. Gentlemen, I'd hate to be in his shoes. - So would I. It don't make sense. "Secretary of the Treasury confesses scandal!" "Latest sensation!" "Secretary of the Treasury confesses scandal!" For remembrance. Betsy. He's almost packed and ready to go. It's good of you. To come to tell me goodbye. But I didn't come to tell you goodbye. You didn't really care for her, did you? No .. [ Door knocks ] Yes? Mr Jefferson and Senator Monroe want to see you, sir. Mr Maurice and Mr Gerald, and a lot of other gentlemen. Alright, I'll come. My friends. My friends of yesterday. They've come to tell me. That my Bill. Has failed. Oh, my dear. Betsy. Wait for me here. No. Let me stand by you. Hmm. Gentlemen. I am at your service. Colonel Hamilton. You see before you men of your own party. As well as your political opponents. They have asked me to speak for them. Now, Mr Jefferson. Let me spare you that painful duty. I know why you are here. You have come in advance of President Washington's orders. To relieve me of my office. And to tell me .. that my Bill has been defeated. I must accept the verdict. Colonel Hamilton. I have been asked to tell you that every man in this room. Every man in the cabinet. Every man in the Senate. [ Trumpet fanfare! ] [ Trumpet fanfare! ] I have the honor to announce the President Of The United States. Colonel Hamilton. I have come to express my confidence in your integrity. You have upheld the honor of the Secretary of the Treasury. At the expense of Alexander Hamilton the man. By your courageous action you have swung all parties to your support. Your Bill has been passed by an overwhelming vote. Oh my dear .. President Washington. I am deeply moved. By this expression of your confidence. And by the generosity of these gentlemen. In their judgement of me. But the passage of my Bill. Has stirred within me a still deeper feeling. The defeat .. or the victory .. 0f Alexander Hamilton the man. Is of small value compared .. With the honor of this great nation. By the passing of this Bill .. You have established the credit of the United States. You have opened the floodgates of prosperity. A prosperity that will reach far beyond our present vision. A prosperity .. That will one day make America. The most powerful nation in the world. -(t-g)-
