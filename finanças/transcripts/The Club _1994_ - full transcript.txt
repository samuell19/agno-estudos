THE CLUB EASTERN HIGH Our Royal Winners Eastern High Prom 1993 I wish we could be alone. We will. I love you. I love you too. It affects everything, you know. I just don't know how much more I can take. So why don't you break up with him? He gets violent sometimes. I guess I'm just afraid of what he'll do. Why am I telling you this? Because sometimes it's good to talk to a stranger. Don't be long. They're gonna announce the winners at midnight. I'll be right back. Well there you go. There's a little girly for you. Which one? That little devil with the red dress on her. Oh, get serious. All you gotta do is ask. Trust me, I just saved her of the embarrassment of turning me down. Okay, look, we both know you're not the best-looking guy, right? Fuck you! Excuse me? Just leave me alone. You know, you try to help some people, they just don't want to listen. This one's empty. - You think it's okay? - Oh yeah. Come on in. - Kyle we have to talk. - Look ... I know it hasn't exactly worked out before. Kyle, we ... I promise ... it'll be different. Mr. Evan Douglas, ladies and gentlemen. Mr. Carver. - You want a shot? - No. No, thanks. Do you mind? No, I don't. How about now? Come on Evan, what the hell? Evan, I am around you kids every day, day in day out. Night and day. As a guidance counselor I know what goes around. I just wanted to take a leak, okay? Amy Parker. That name ... just kind of rolls off the tongue, doesn't it? What is she let you do? I don't think that that's any of your business. It makes me kind of what? Go back and teach gym class and all? Ah, volleyball. All them ... all them new girls, running around on the floor off them tight uniform, you know. Can I go now? Amy is one fine piece of ass, Evan. I think she has to fuck at the school. Well, that's that time you all've been waiting for ... Amy? - You're gonna win for sure. - Thanks, Lisa. Really, you're so lucky. Evan's the greatest. He'll do anything for you. Where is he anyway? I don't know. ... for the most not even Cube Cup were the most likely to live happily ever after. So whose idea was this prince and princess in a castle anyway? No, Kyle. No, Kyle. No, Kyle ... Kyle, forget it. Just wait, Laura. Just let me go. Laura, you're not even trying. But this isn't working. Isn't working? It was going great. Look, sometimes I just wish it was over. There's only so much I can take, Kyle. You won't talk to me about it. I feel like there's nothing I can do. Fine. Kyle! - Come on! Go ahead! Go ahead and say it, Laura! - Stop it, Kyle! Say you want to break up with me! - Kyle! Kyle, stop! - Wait. Say, say: I wanna break up with you! Cause you're an impotent bastard. Is that it, Laura? - Is that it, goddamn it? - Stop it, Kyle! Oh, I'm sorry. Laura! He still can't get up, right, Kyle? Who the fuck do you think you are, heh? You're losing her. Hey, Evan. Where have you been? You and Amy were just name prince and princess of the prom. Do I know you? John Rotman. DC residents, eh? Right. Uh ... - So, you know Amy. - Yeah, sure. Have you seen her? Amy? Uh ... You know, I think she was there, had been looking for you. Thanks a lot. Mr. Carver, right? You don't look so good. I'm fine. Never better. You don't go to this school, do you? No. What's your name? John Rotman. I'm dating an Eastern girl. Lisa Resnick. Fucking hot body, heh? Almost as nice as the one you raped at Wesmount High. Oh yeah. I was there, I saw you. Hey hey hey hey hey ... There was seven, wasn't there? Yeah, I think that's it. I think it's seven. And you murdered the last four when you realized that they didn't want you. Yeah, but who would want you? You're a sick fucking man. But you get nut while the killing now, right? When you're nut it's the best part. It's really turning you on. That's okay. Amy Parker. I'll bet you go on after her tonight. I'll bet you're gonna do her tonight. How'd you know all this ...? Because I know you. I know what kind of sick fucking guy you are. I know what's her name. I know what a sick fucking guy you are. Mean I know lots of things. I know about ... mother. You're going out for this. Stay away from me, Kyle! Just leave me alone! Laura! Come here! Laura! Laura! What the fuck? Amy? Miss Parker. You know, it's funny, because I was just talking about you. I'm having so much fun tonight. Are you having fun? - Evan! - Amy! Amy! Amy. Amy! Amy, I've never told you how much I love you. Never told you that? Ladies first. Ladies first. Don't fun? - Always so much fun! - No, please, don't! Don't speak. Evan! Evan, help me, please! Get the fuck away from her! Evan! Get up. Okay, young man. It's lesson time. Evan! Evan! Run, darling. Run! What is going on? Amy! It's very one incredible practical joke. Please! Amy! Save me! Amy. Amy. It's me. It's Evan. Where is everybody? Where is Carver? I don't know. He was running after me, and when I turned around he was gone. Are you okay? Yeah. So where is everybody? I thought it was dreaming until I ran into you. Can't be sure in your dream. Fucking weird or what? You know, I'm really glad to see you guys, cause I was beginning to think that I was all alone. Where is everybody? That's about to ask you that same question. Your name is John, right? Good memory. He's Lisa Resnick's date. Yeah, that's right. So you two know each other? Is Lis here? Well I don't know. I mean, where's here? Where is everybody? This is all completely impossible. No matter what number you dial, you get a busy signal. Try 911. - It's busy. - So I just said. I'll call home. We have call waiting. This is unbelievable. I mean, I thought I was losing my fucking mind. I guess for those people can disappear, anything can happen, huh? No, nobody can just disappear. Oh yeah? How do you know that? Every number I dial is busy. - Laura! - Please, help me! Laura, wait! Help me! Calm down. Keep him away from me! Take it easy, I'm not gonna hurt you. You tried to beat me! I did not! I ... I got a little upset. I'm s ... I'm sorry if I scared you, honey. What happened? I tried to get away from Kyle, but he chased me. So I ran into the bathroom, I looked in the mirror ... It wasn't me. My face was deformed. It was so real. You ain't seen nothing yet. Oh, hey! It's a needle-dick. I'm not done with you yet, pal. Hey! Just take it easy. All right? And we got more important things to deal with. I don't get it, where are we going? Trust me, you won't believe unless you see it. I don't like this. Don't think we've been introduced. I'm Darren Scott. Hanging on the library. I was editor of the school paper last year. I wrote an article on spores amoeba and their sex life. No way. All right, where is everybody? We don't know. This is crazy. Impossible is more like. Well they gotta be around here somewhere. They're gone, pal. Hey, don't be a putz, all right? I mean 300 people don't just disappear. - Are we dead? - Do you feel dead? I don't know, I've never been dead before. Well I don't feel dead. How do you know what dead feels like? You guys are screwed. I'm geting the hell out of here! Look, I already tried that. Beating yourself up isn't gonna help. Let's go back. What's going on? I don't know. Look, there's got to be a logical explanation. - All right, look ... - I just heard the weirdest scream. - Evan, this is crazy. - Evan, do something. We can't get out here. We're trapped. We're fucked! Just everybody calm down. Okay? We got to think this through. I think we should split up and look around. I think we should stick together. It's safer. Yeah. We should all just stay right here. Until somebody comes and rescues you? - What is your problem? - My problem? Yeah. Am I the only one who finds this exciting? What do you think, this is fun? Oh yeah. How many times in life does this kind of shit happen? Never. Let's have some team spirit. We have stumbled onto something very strange. An adventure in a lifetime, and I say let's explore it. All right. We'll keep the groups as big as possible. Okay. I'm not going with him. Oh come on. I'm not going with Kyle. I'll go with Laura. Be careful. You're gonna make me puke. I don't think I like him very much. I don't trust him. What's wrong? My watch had stopped. Mine too. Our watches have screwed up here. Everything is screwed up around here. We simply meet them back in an hour. How are we supposed to know where an hour is out? What's the difference, man? We are gonna die anyway, right? I definitely don't like him. I've never been so scared in all my life. What exactly are you scared of? I don't know. Monsters ... Ghost ... Why, are you afraid? Frankly I find reality scary enough. So you think we're dead. - Well, we'll be. - So what's the point? The point is that I'm getting real tired of waiting around. I tried the doors and the windows won't break. Well obviously somebody doesn't want us right here. It's a library. I bet we can find some answers in here. What are we gonna do? Look up missing persons in the card catalog? I'm not touching anything. All these books have the same title. Yeah, they're just different volumes. I say we go through some of these. Oh, I'm so grossed out of this woman I can hardly speak. THE CLUB MURDERERS vol. 1926 Screw this. I'm not opening any doors. Now we're gonna find the way out. Hey, I don't know, but I don't care. I'm just not opening any doors. Suit yourself. It's empty. What happened last time you opened the door? Nothing. You're not the only one, Kyle. Seen so pretty freaky shit too. Good for you. What you say? What is this? - Twenty questions? - Aren't you wondering why us? So you think there's a reason for all this. Well well well. Empty. Listen, if we've all had these strange visions about what was happening to us before all this started, maybe that has something to deal with. Maybe. Maybe we're getting fucked around with that fellow. Okay. I hope. You know what, buddy? I really don't wanna know. Made you look. I hate that guy. Amy, you should have seen the look on Kyle's face. He could have killed me. God, Laura, how would you say with him for so long? He was always so sorry. I mean he's been screwed up since his dad died. I felt we could work through it together. But just didn't handle it anymore and he wasn't dealing with anything. Was he really gonna hit you? Thank God that guy John walked in on us. He saved my life You know I think we're lost. What gives you that idea? I don't know where we are. Now you're a pretty funny guy considering the mess we're in. Well, what am I gonna tell you? It's a defense mechanism. I think we should split up and look around. What the fuck? - Hell, man! Jesus ... - What the hell? Are you okay? What the ... That should not fucking happen. That should not fucking happen. That shouldn't fucking happen! Shut the fuck up! Okay? That shouldn't fucking happen, but it did. So deal with it! What the fuck was that? Okay, look, I don't know. We gotta find the girls, we got to find Darren ... we gotta find them round here. Amy? Amy? What is it? Darren? Are you okay? Darren, what's wrong? My god. It can't be. He's been dead for ten years. God ... I must tell them! - Laura. - No, I have to warn them! Don't go! Then come with us. I can't. And you'll never find them. Just stay here. I'll be right back, I promise. Open your eyes, cry-baby. Can't hide from yourself, can you? You're not real. Can't lie to yourself either. What are you running for? I thought you wanted to die. What are you running from? I think it's this way. Evan, you really thin there's a reason for all this happening to us? Yeah, I do. I was gonna hit Laura before this all started. Jesus, Kyle. Yeah look, I know it's wrong. You know, I just couldn't help it. I got so angry when she broke up with me and she wouldn't even listen to what I say. Oh, don't excuse, Kyle. So what? Is this my punishment? Is that what this is all about? Yeah. Or maybe it's a chance for you to realize what you're about to do and change it. You mean like if we ever get out of here. Yeah. We were gonna commit suicide. - No. - Weren't we? Nobody cares about us. We were going to show them. No. What were we going to do? Slit our wrists? Maybe ... asphyxiation? You really have to stop torturing yourself like this. Laura! Laura! Did you hear that? Hear what? My heart's beating so fucking loud I can barely hear you. Something screamed. There it is again. Come on, let's go. - It's this way. - No it's this way. A gun to the head. Our guns are very dangerous. Even though when they're gonna go off. - Please. - Accidentally. Very messy too. That's alright. But we wanted that way, don't we? Let them be grossed out. They don't care about us. Let them see that. I know. No. Why not self disembowelment? - Membership, Darren. - No. Suicide gets you into the club. Decapitation. Now it's the time. Trust me. Take the rope. Yes. Just have to let it go. Do it. Come on! Put your head in there! It's quick, its painless and it's messy. Just the way you like it. Do it! Come on. Yeah. Too little too late. Great. God dammit! I'm sick and tired of this haunted house shit. All right? I mean if this keeps up I'm gonna have a heart attack and gray hair before I'm thirty. Don't! Look, we're gonna have to open one of these doors. You open one of the fucking doors, okay? I've had it up to here with the goddamn doors. I don't want to get sucked in some door, I don't wanna get sucked off by some monster, I don't want to die screaming from some horrible fucking death. All right? And I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna go back the way we came in. All right? Wait a second. Hey, see you, buddy, huh? Laura. Oh, Kyle. My baby. It's okay, I got you. God, honey, you're shaking. It's okay, baby. Come with me. Look, I made a fire. It's nice and warm. I got to tell you about John. But don't worry. I know all about him. - He's gone. - Gone? What do you mean "he's gone"? Disappeared, like the others. How do you know about them? Well, Amy found Evan and me and she told us about it. Amy? Where is Amy? She never went back to the library to get Darren? Come on closer to the fire, get worm. We should go. Stay, for just a few minutes. I'm getting the creeps from being here. Laura, I'm really sorry about what happened before. - Forget it. - I can't. I love you. I didn't want to hurt you. It's okay. The point is if this is it, I mean, if we're gonna suddenly disappear, - you are, I mean, I ... - Kyle, I wanna get out of here! Can't we be together? Please. I am so scared. I know. So am I. I wanna make love to you, honey. What? Here? Now? Are you crazy? We don't know where we are, or what's gonna happen to us. But if this is our last moment together, we should spend it making love. - Kyle ... - Shh ... please. Just try. It's me. It's only me. What are you doing? Dance with me. Evan, - John has been dead for 10 years. - I know, I know. Laura found me and Kyle. Where are they? They went to the library for Darren. They're gonna meet us back here. Why do you think John pretended to be one of us? Maybe for fun, maybe split us up, I don't know. Why would he want to split us up? Maybe because we're stronger as long as we're together. Don't leave me alone again. I won't. Make love to me. Now? Yeah. - Here? - Yeah. Hey, come on. It will be great. What if it's ...? What if it's the last chance we ever get? Evan, - I really love you. - I love you too. But I can't right here. Well then kiss me. Stop me if you can. Get the hell away from my girlfriend! Is this mean I'm in trouble? I thought you were dead. Well I am, but does that mean we can't be friends? Just stay away from us. Why? What do you think I'm gonna do? Do you think I'm gonna kill you? Come on. You know why they always run when I say that? It's about time! Dinner is ruined. Bad trip. You know you can run but you can't hide. Run! Run! Full basket! What's that clap about? Come here. Come on. Oh yeah, and I'm gonna kill you. Burn in hell! Oh, I'm on fire! Everybody is a comedian. Come on. Give me a kiss. I'm hot for you, baby. Come on! Wait, wait a second. Why? What's wrong? I don't want to do this. Not here. Laura. I'm afraid. So am I. You don't understand. I'm afraid of you. Me? Why? Kyle, you tried to beat me and you are gonna do it again. I said I'd never do that again. and I meant it. Well I said it was over and I meant it. I'm sorry, Kyle. Come on, let's just get out of here and forget it, okay? You really are afraid of me. Aren't you? You should stand up to me. Stop it Kyle, you're hurting me. What are you gonna do? Save yourself. Stand up to me. Stop it, Kyle. Make me. I don't hear anything. I think he got them. You know, I'm gonna quit. I know I've said it before but I'm really gonna do it. Sorry. Hey, come on! I'm the type of guy who likes to party 100 miles an hour with his hair on fire. You know something, Ernie ... Evan. Whatever. The thing is this: I like your style and to be a hundred percent honest, this is what I like about you. Usually when people take a look at me they're just dumpin their pants and die screaming. I've always been different. People have told me that. You know, they say ... OK, look, Evan, I bet you're wondering just exactly who I am. Yeah. Well I'm gonna show you. Right here at the top of the heap we have the Prince of Darkness, the very incarnation of evil. Where are you? Yes, I hadn't had much schooling. Anyway, I'm down here. A lonely member of the club. A disciple ... and apprentice of sorts. Yes, you bubbles in the second room, you have a question? You're saying that there really is a d... No no no no no ... Come on. I wouldn't say that if I were you, because he really fucking hates it, when you use his name vain. Okay? I just need to know. I mean if he exists, and that means that there really is a G ... Say it, and I'll rip your heart out, okay? So you're saying that there is one. I can't answer that. But by not answering. Around and around and around it goes. Where it stops nobody knows. This Court is now on session. Taking the Fifth Amendment is not demission of guilt. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I'd left room for doubt, and this is what it's all about. Doubt. Doubt you want to believe in, doubt in yourselves. This is our little way of testing you. Well what do you mean? Aren't you going through a little bit of a crisis? You mean Carver? You were afraid he was gonna rape poor Amy here? And ultimately you were afraid that after he was done raping you well he was gonna kill you. So this is about fate? Will you risk your life to save Amy here? And you, will you submit the pray he doesn't kill you? Or will you fight? What happens here decides what will really happen. Now you catch it on. Why now? - Why us? - Why now? Why us? It's not just you, it's everybody. Just exactly how did you get into this line of work? I ... committed suicide. I kind in Rosie in the service. Suicide or murder, either way you're pretty much damn for eternity. So you have no choice. Let's just say you know who made me do it. Laura? Why my bedroom? Did you sleep well? No. No. I had the weirdest dream ever. I'm Sorry. Kyle, let me help you forget it. What are you doing? Same thing we did last night. Don't you remember? I remember the prom. That's all? And we were looking for a rooms, so we could be alone. Can't believe you don't remember. I'm sorry. It's okay. I'll be for fresh your memory. You didn't break up with me? Don't be stupid, I love you. Laura I'm sorry, I really am. It must have been a horrible dream. Yeah. A real doozy. We don't worry. We can do it again. If you're feeling up to it. You want me, don't you, Kyle? I ca... I ... Tell me you want me, Kyle. I can't. Why not, Kyle? I can't! Let's just say you know who made do it. We stop time and screw around every once in a while and either you conquer your fears or you face the consequences ... This is about fate? You just don't remember it from one time to the next, but we do, we had it all up and we decide whether you get to live, or whether you die. Congratulations! Congratulations, you both graduaded - and let me just say I'm damn proud of. - Now what? Well, now you kill her. I'm having a bad day. Didn't you hear him? He can't really kill you here. The only power he has over you is your own fear. I can't help but I'm scared. Nothing left the fear but fear itself. That's it. You're ready to face your fears? There's nothing to fear but your face. That's a good one, Mr. Asshead. You should see it when I turned it inside out. There's no need to show us. You know what just occurred to me? That we did not finish what we started! And I'm getting kind of horny. You have to kill me first, if you can. If I can? Hey. I do. Well where's mine? Fuck that shit! You don't get one! You know something, sweetheart? You got personality. And you ... You know, Evan, I think you're beginning to get scared. Oh yeah? What gives you that idea? Well for one thing you wet your pants. Made you look, see! Why did you tell me how to beat you? I certainly did not. Oh yes, you did. You really don't think you can win, do you? I know I can. I think you want me to win. Show me where the bad man touched you. I'm not afraid of you. Oh Evan, I think you're getting desperate. I think you're just lost. What about her? How about it? Are you strong enough? Are you afraid yet? Don't look at me, look at him! Fight him, Amy! Okay, Amy. Now I'm gonna kill you. Come. Come come come come ... Oh, it' love. She's strong, she'll beat you too. I want you. No. I need you. Oh ... It's love. Yes, love. Up! Up up up up... Swords and velvet. Nothing when I get you. It's not really Carver! He can't hurt you! Fight him, Amy! Come, come come come ... Silky dress and so was. Up up up up ... Slowly. Down! Fight him, Amy! Fight him! - I can't. - It's not really Carver! Fight him! It's Carver! Lave her alone! Feeling helpless young man? Because, you know, you had your chance to save her but you failed. So now you get to watch. Comfortable? It's a good view, isn't it? No. Yes, I don't want you to miss anything. Fight him! You gotta fight him, Amy! Fight him! You wouldn't think about running and this chain will start to slide. Watch. Get the hell away from her! Fight him, Amy! Don't be shy just because the young man might watch. You missed me here. I just really really really missed you. Really. Carver! You son of a bitch! You like it, huh? Oh yes! Baby ... Rough night. Yeah. You know, I'd pretty much give up on little Amy. How you're gonna find her again? You mean, this is amaze. And you know, I'll bet your Carver is doing a tour right now. Can't change fate. Fate? See about that. A hang-nail. No, you know you're lost. Okay, I think you'll go left there, you go down there, but I'd say go west, young man. Oh my god, we're trapped! Oh yeah, he's gonna get you. Tear her apart. You know something, Amy? I think I'm just gonna have to tear you apart. It's the boy-blunder! Stupid boy. Oh God! Ouch! Get the sword, get the sword, get the sword. Come on, come on. Oh yeah, oh yeah! He's coming after you. He's coming after us. He's gonna kill you. He's gonna kill us. Let's keep moving. Go. Go kill them! They hurt you! Evan! Come on! Come on! It's that way. It's that way. No, it's this way. Come on. Gotcha. We're trapped. What are we gonna do? Looking for something? I mean, don't you just hate looking for something but you can't find it? It is behind this door? No. Perhaps this one? But you know, I'm getting a very good feeling about this corner. Scared boys! It's the last found apartment. I say recess is now over. - Come on! - Run Amy! Evan! No! You fucking son of a bitch! - I wish we were alone. - We will be. Tonight is the night. I love you. I love you too. - This one's empty. - You think it's okay? Yeah, come on in. Kyle, we have to talk. Look, I know it hasn't exactly worked out before. - Kyle ... - But I promise you, this time will be different. You bet your bippy. He doesn't want you. Forget it, Kyle. Slow down, mister. Just wait a second, Laura. Figure out why you still can't miss it. Let me go. Look, talk amongst yourselves. This isn't working. Isn't working? It was going great. You know, sometimes I think she just wishes it was over. Sometimes I just wish it was over. There's only so much more I can take, Kyle. You won't talk to me about it, I feel like there's nothing I can do. Fine. Kill her. Wouldn't you break up with me, huh? Is that what you want? You go on and break up with me? Come on, tell me you wanna break up with me, cause I'm impotent. Is that it? Is that it? You slut! Right in the goal! Laura! - Kyle, no! - Say it! Laura! Oh no. She broke. Lots of witnesses. Do you have any idea what they do to cute little redhead boys in jail? Murder gets you in Kyle. Welcome to the club. My god, I can't hold this happened. Come on, let's get out of here. No, I forgot my purse. - No, I'll come with you. - No, I'll get it. Be right back. Get the car. Why would make Kyle do something like that? I don't know. Some people are just fucked up. You love me, don't you? You know, I think he's just using you for the sex. Sure I love you. I mean if something were wrong with us you could handle it, right? Hey, hey, we talked about it. What's wrong? She's pregnant. Greg, I'm pregnant. All right. What? What are we gonna do? You ever consider to try the suicide? How could you do this to me? Okay. What? Don't think that was the right thing to say, Greggy boy. Amy. Miss Parker. I know it's funny. It's funny me. I was just talking about you. I'm having so much fun tonight ... Are you having fun? How extacy!
