* A couple of terms to avoid any confusion in the movie* *Barbouzes is the French for Beard, it is also slang for spy* Stanislas in the Spotlight Our show will continue in a few moments MEMOIRS OF A VERY SECRET AGENT Here?s a book that many people will read during the next few months. I have the pleasure of welcoming its author: Stanislas Evariste Dubois. - Hello. - Stanislas Evariste Dubois, for this, the third volume of your Memories of a Very Secret Agent, you were just awarded the Barbouzes Award. I can?t deny it. A very rare occurrence, you were awarded it by an unanimous jury. I?m very flattered. And also because I realize the growing interest of my readers for stories that do not owe everything to the romantic imagination of a writer. Yes, it must be said that your memoirs are genuine memoirs. I?ll answer with a paraphrase of Stendhal: "Adventure is the only thing which rewards itself in a coin of its own manufacture". A nice phrase. Would you be willing to go back to that adventure? - No. - I hope nevertheless that one day we?ll read a fourth volume of "Memoirs of a Very Secret Agent". May I congratulate you, Sir? You were perfect. - Really, Paul, do you think so? - You should grow it, Sir. Virginie? Who wants a nice sugar cube? Look. Look, Virginie: sugar. Virginie! Ah! Good dog, Virginie. - Thank you. - The plumber is here. Oh, Morin! I feel great! Another bill... One fine, two fines, the telephone... Ah, the clippings. The reviews! I wouldn?t take them so seriously if I were you. You?re wrong. A bad review is like cod-liver oil: you don?t like it but it sometimes does you a lot of good. Coffee, Morin? The writer plays the trumpets of dithyramb... to talk about a character he admires a lot: himself. He complacently tells us so-called memories in which clich?s rival the utmost vulgarity. Cod-liver oil, Sir. Who signed this rag? Rameau?s nephew... And, pray, who is Rameau?s nephew? The critic?s alias, Sir. Well, this gentleman who doesn?t dare sign his name is going to hear from me. Come in! - Where is he? - Who? - The... er... Rameau?s nephew. - You are Stanislas Dubois. Mr Rameau is out. I?m his secretary. May I take down a message? - Just tell him he?s a conceited oaf! - Conceited oaf... - A coward. - A coward... Why a coward? Because an alias is a coward?s screen, Miss. I mean: do I have an alias? I was very pleased to meet you. - So was I, Sir. - Goodbye. Dear friends! How could I express, dear friends, my joy at seeing you all assembled around me? For one night, I merely want to be the President of "Little Black Chairs". Our charming hostesses will circulate among you, selling raffle tickets. I call upon your generosity. I?m sure there will be numerous donations. A thousand thanks in advance. - Hey, what are you doing here? - Probably the same as you. - Give me three tickets, please. - For me too. Say, the two of you are getting along nicely. Congratulations: you?re not one to hold a grudge. - A grudge? - What? You don?t know each other? - Excuse-me, Daniel, I must go. - Not before I introduce you. Stanislas, this is B?n?dicte Rameau, a. k. a. Rameau?s nephew. The most Parisian of Viennese women. And the most charming. - And the most indulgent too. - Charmed. What?s the matter? Did I goof? Congratulations, my dear chap, you were luckier than I was. Magnificent, isn?t it? Mrs President. Give my regards to your husband. He?s still in New York. He?ll be back in a couple of days. Wait just a minute, mister Stanislas Dubois! I?ve got something to tell you. You?ll be driving me home, darling, won?t you? What an evening! I thought it?d never end. You?re not going to help the scatterbrained girl who trashed your book, are you? We should always repay evil with good, Mrs President. So, Nephew? Are we in trouble? But let me tell you it?s not my fault this time. I put you in charge of the investigation. Four flat tires! Do you realize? No wonder! You parked on a taxi stand. Come. I?ll drive you. Wait a moment. - Thank you, you?re very kind. - Damn! This must weigh a ton! I?m taking some work home. New books. I don?t know why, but everyone thinks he?s a writer these days. - Oh, sorry: I didn?t mean you. - Of course not: you already did. - Really, you shouldn?t have bothered. - Here you are. I don?t know how to thank you. You really don?t hold grudges. I admire you, actually. - Better late than never. Good night. - Good night. - Is he dead? - No, not quite. Would you please help me? Where is there a phone? We must call the Police. My place, if you want to. Third floor, on the right. Here: the phone is in the living room. Don?t move. Be quiet. The Thirteen! They got me. Listen to me. Coffin... - Coffin? What coffin? - Coff... in... Finley, yes, in the 15th borough. Yes, that?s it. Number 9. Thank you. He?s dead. I?ll tell her. We must wait for the Police. I?ll go with you. The driver will be here in no time. Apparently he won?t: you?ve been calling him for fifteen minutes. Right! Sounding your horn in the middle of the night, that?s one. Illegal parking, that?s two. Muddy number plates at the front, three. Muddy number plates at the rear, four. No side lights, five. You?ll talk to the owner of the car. Here he is now. Gentlemen, I?m not to blame. There?s a dead man. Of course there is. That's what they always say. - A dead man? - Yes, sir, I?m positive. And where is the dead man? - Here he is. On the bench. - Dear God! Alright, I think this is going to cost you plenty. Contempt of law-enforcement officers... What about this? Is this contempt too? Hey, I guess this is blood... He was hiding in a building. Marco trapped him in an elevator. Empty his pockets. - The master is working! - Put him on the line anyway. Just a second, Sir. Hello? So now you?re picking up dead bodies in the middle of the night? - Good old Stanislas! - So you?re already aware of it? I am indeed. Come here, I?m buying you lunch. Oh, you! You?re obviously entertaining some idea. Absolutely not. Your imagination is running wild. I?m waiting for you. Forensic science laboratory. Yes, this is the bloke I saw last night. Who is he? He was called Vesnourian. He was found this morning in the lake in the "Bois de Boulogne". - Oh? What about the investigation? - Bah! Let the Police handle it. Everybody believes it was murder for money... which suits me. Come, let?s go and have lunch. - Yes. - Miss Rameau? Yes I am. My name is Vesnourian. Robert Vesnourian. - I?m the brother of the man who, tonight... - Please accept my deepest sympathy. Thank you. - Do you know why he died? - Because of a bullet in his lung. I meant: why he was killed. Nobody knows. He was in love with a married woman, you know, and when things like that happen... Maybe it was a crime of passion. What can I do for you? Well... Did he say something before he died? By the way, did he talk before he died? I wouldn?t know. He was raving and, when I came back, he was already dead. It?s quite important. We?d been in touch with him for three months. Well, won?t you ask me what this was all about? Oh no, no! There are two things that I?ll never forgive you. First, not wearing your Legion of Honour, and second... - Resigning, I know. - Put yourself in my place. - Certainly not. - Would you like ice? - Here. - Thanks. Vesnourian was a member of a huge export-import company. - Dealing in State secrets. - Oh, the Thirteen Columns. See, when you?re trying! Yes, absolutely, the Thirteen Columns. The organization considerably expanded lately. It now has worldwide subdivisions. Vesnourian offered me a complete list of all members of the organization. Can you imagine? - Yes? - 07 on line 1, Colonel. Put him on. Hello, boss? This is 07. Four plus three. Alright, I just saw the American coming out of Le Figaro?s offices. Yes, yes, he wanted to see the Rameau girl. 07 at your disposition. Regards, colonel! You must see that girl again. - Maybe Vesnourian told her something. - Of course not. I?d know it. I?d rather be sure of it. Come on, invite her for dinner. Alright, dear nephew. Goodbye. Well? I?m meeting her at 7 p. m. in front of Le Figaro?s offices. Happy? Perfect! This way, we?ve got the time to visit her place. What? Why? And why did the American just leave her office? If he wants to go to her place, I?d rather get there before he does this time. Come, Fran?ois, I need you. Fran?ois... Come on, hurry up. - Hey! Can you smell something? - No. What a perfume! It reminds me of a doll I once knew when I was garrisoned in Sidi Bel Abbes. She called me Sweetheart. - Miss Rameau, I presume? - Sir? Let me introduce myself: I?m Gregory Vesnourian, - uncle of the unfortunate... - Oh, I bet you want to know his last words. I can see how admirably you understand an uncle?s suffering. I?m merely getting the hang of it. I had your nephews?s visit this morning. Why don?t you talk to him? Good night. Come on, move over! No way: this is a maiden?s bed, there?s no space for two. Come on, let?s split! Hands up! I guess I now just have to say farewell. - I was delighted to meet you. - Hands up! - Yes, yes, yes, yes... - Halt, or I shoot! Sorry. Please allow me. My respectful compliments... Oh, dear! I?m going to be late... Well, now, I just have to wish you a good evening! I?ll be back in no time, please excuse me. - Two coffees please. - Yes, Sir. Hello? Yes, hold the line. It?s for you, Sweetheart! Hello? Oh, it?s you. I bring you news of Vesnourian. He said verrrry interesting things before he died, you know. - I felt sure of that. - First, he said a number: thirteen. Yes, thirteen as in Thirteen Columns. It means they killed him. We knew that. And then? Then he mouthed one word: coffin. - Coffin? Is that all? - Yes, that?s all. You now just have to visit all the cemeteries in France and Navarre to find your list. It supposed to be in a coffin? Oh God! So if I understand correctly, you?re a kinsman of his? - That?s it. - What a family! - Brother? Uncle? - Cousin. And, of course, you want to know what he told me before he died? Just so. Oh, so nowadays you prefer Walther to Beretta in London? May I introduce James, James Beckinbury, who serves Her Most Gracious Majesty. Official correspondant for The Times. You see, I too took to writing. Cheerio. Oh, my dear colleague! You?re forgetting your pen! Virginie! Paul! Paul! Virginie! Where is Virginie? Where? Oh, the savages! Oh, the savages! Oh, my little Virginie, come my doggy, come my little doll, come... It?s always good to know how high your boss rates you. That?s how you create Soviets! Oh, my poor friend! They were brutes! What with your rheumatism... - There were at least four of them. - No, there were three since... Do not talk all at the same time. At what time did they arrive? I can?t say exactly. You?d just left. But I know there were three of them. - They rushed me, I couldn?t even... - No, there were four! No, there were three. Two of them were even Chinese. Can?t you agree? So, how many men were there? - Oh, you know, what with my rheumatism... - Yes, of course, you didn?t see anything. Hello? Yes it is. Please hold the line, I?ll call him. It?s for you, Sweetheart! For me? Hello? I?ll tell the master. Yes, come in. - Your tax inspector has arrived, Sir. - Isn?t he always on time? Ah, my dear friend! I can see you already found my cheque! Yes. Should all taxpayers be like you... I don?t know what the minister of the Treasury would say. I?m one year late in paying my taxes... I meant it?s a pleasure to sit from time to time at your table... Be assured that the pleasure is mutual. So, how are you, my dear friend? Well, I had a minor heart attack last month but... You?ll have a whisky anyway, won?t you? Delighted. Straight, please. Well, as I said, I had a minor heart attack last month but I saw a doctor, he ordered rest, I rested, and I think that I can now feel easy in my mind. I?ll knock on wood anyway. - Cheers! - Cheers! Hey, what?s happening to you? Morin! Come quick! Oh my God! Well, I had a narrow escape. I hope he makes it. - So indulgent a man, so understanding! - Oh, B?n?dicte! Oh, you?re home. Wait for me: I?m coming. - And don?t you drink anything! - But I?m not thirsty! - What is it? - Poisoning. - Where are you taking her? - La Riboisi?re hospital. Alright, I... And now for some shuteye! Can?t they watch where they?re going? You scum! In this gallery, second only to the equally famous gallery of mirrors in Versailles, Prince-to-be Ga?tan de la Thibaudi?re was murdered in 1795... er... sorry: 1595. If you raise your head, you can still glimpse the original ceiling... Come in! - I thought I forbade you to disturb me. - The prisoner regained conciousness, Sir. Alright, take him to the main lounge. I?ll join him. Sit down. Well, miss, did you finally decide to answer our questions? Let?s try again: did Mr Vesnourian tell you anything about some documents? A list, for instance. Did you fully understand the question? I repeat that Vesnourian didn?t say anything. Very well. Come, miss, I wouldn?t inflict upon you such an awful sight! Proceed, doctor! Don?t be afraid: just a small and simple treatment. "Blessed art thou, my Lord who offer suffering as a divine remedy for our impurities. " Baudelaire. "The flowers of Evil". Any suffering is better than death, isn?t it, Mr Dubois? If you talk, Miss, your friend will have a slight chance of survival. Once and for all, I swear I don?t know anything. I warned you... - No, no, stop! - Oh, so now you?re being sensible. - I?m listening! - Vesnourian mentioned a coffin. That?s all. A coffin? What kind of a joke is this? But he was raving... I swear... No, no! Enough! I?ll tell you everything. I?ve also got it as a stereo LP. A minor marvel. Oh my God, I absolutely must tell them something. Anything... - Vesnourian gave me a briefcase. - A briefcase? Yes, a leather... a black leather briefcase. - I didn?t open it. It was locked anyway. - Where did you put the briefcase? - Into a safe. - Where. - In my bank. - Which bank? - The "Soci?t? de Banque et de Cr?dit". - How long had you known Vesnourian? He was... He was my brother. I?m starving. When do we eat? In half an hour. Is a leg of lamb with beans alright with you? This way! Say, have you got a light? I lost my lighter again. Yes, here. Hey, guys! The prisoner escaped, we must tell the boss. - What are you, crazy? - He jumped into the gallery, - I tell you. I mean I saw him! - You saw him, you saw him, it just ain?t possible. How do you expect him to hide in here? There he is! Let me introduce myself: Honor? Labray de Quillancourt, this castle?s curator. My wife. My collaborators. We?ve been here for more than one week. Well... Be patient for a couple more days then I?ll take care of you. - You? It?s you? - Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You?ll faint later. Come. - But you?re not hurt. - I?ll explain later. - Well... alright. - Come on, out! This way! There you go. There?s no danger whatsoever, I?ll be holding you. Come on, be brave. ...can?t take this off... Why don?t you pull? Ouch... no, no, on the other side, on the other... I?ve heard of potheads but this is ridiculous. - It?s so dark in here. - Let?s go. Come on! Let?s go! Push! Forget it! We?ll call the others! Come on: one, two, three! Well, what are you all doing here? Come on, quick! - Here you are, madam. - Thank you. Give me Paris, operator, please. Hello? - It?s for you, Sweetheart. - Is it? Do not trouble yourself. In this state, it won?t cover but a hundred yards more. The fan heater is a regular strainer now. We must have it towed to Alen?on. Do you think so? I?ll call my father: he lives in the area. That?s far more simple. My father has been an entomologist for thirty years, a retired diplomat for ten years,and had a heart condition for five years. So, no strong emotions: it?s very bad for his coronaries. - We are on a professional trip. - Professional? You make a very presentable editor in chief. - Of Le Figaro? - Why not? Alright? We just had a minor, run of the mill traffic accident. Oh, here?s Daddy now. - You?ll clean those, Cl?mentine, please. - Right now? No, whenever you?ve got the time. - Say? Is he really your boss? - Of course he is. You look really funny in Daddy?s old clothes. Earlier I phoned a mechanic who?s a friend of mine and asked him to fetch your car. He sent a breakdown truck immediately - Thanks a lot. Do you smoke? - Unfortunately! Never again! Herbal tea, nap and boiled pasta... Here, poor Daddy. At least a sugar cube dripped in coffee. Not even that! Will you allow me? Thank you. Here is a cosmoderus erinaceus, which I?m very very proud of. Here a costolabrus augustus. I had a hard time with that one: quite a rare breed. Well, you?re not really interested in my augustus, are you? Don?t those little beasts suffer when you pin them on the board? It?s possible to be a humane entomologist: I put them to sleep before I operate. I think you didn?t have your nap, Sir. Indeed, wench. I was just going to. - Stanislas? - Yes. - I?ve got something to tell you. - Well, I?m listening. Thank you. For everything. Oh, please thank me again. Your suit is ready, Sir. This is the place. Let?s try the other door. Hands up! Stanislas! Where are you, Stanislas! Tea is ready! Stanis... Oh, my God! They killed him! Shakespearian... The parking lot is over there! Hey! You must have dreamed. I saw his body in the morgue with my very eyes. - I?m afraid, Stanislas. - Why? I?m here. I promise you he?s dead. I swear he?s dead. It?s him! Hello? But where are you? Come in, I was waiting for you. No, I?m not a ghost, I?m just poor Vladimir?s brother. My name is Nikita. See... Nikita Vesnourian. Clock maker. I?ve got very important things to tell you. I?m listening. I?m unfortunately in a hurry so, if you?ll allow me, I?ll get straight to the point. - I know what you?re looking for. - You?re very smart. Since time is running out, I?m ready to tell you where you can find an important document belonging to my infortunate brother. A list... You can see what I mean, don?t you? How much? With your leave, let?s start with the zeroes. In notes of small denomination of course. In my family, we always were partial to cash. Life is so difficult nowadays. Who is that? Lamy and sons ? wigs, false beards, etc. Hello? One moment please. It?s for you, Sweetheart! Hello? I?m listening! What? Oh, I?m sorry! - Have you got a room? - Room 34. - Thank you. - That?s twenty francs. Here you are. - You?re new, aren?t you? - Yes. There?s a lady here, in mourning weeds, who says she?s family. The widow? Already? Let her come in. Isn?t Mr. Vesnourian home? He won?t be for some time, no. What did you want? It?s alright. I?ll come back. Hey! Why did you want to see Mr. Vesnourian? - Because of the tomb. - So soon? Whose tomb? His brother Vladimir?s of course. He was my fianc?. You were engaged to Vladimir Vesnourian? And even a little more than that. This is all very fine. Do you have an ID? My boss wasn?t here this morning and he didn?t see fit to tell me where he spent the night. I absolutely have to speak to him. It?s very important. Where is he? I'm just his secretary, miss, I can?t tell you more. There?s sin in the air... Your name is Rosine Lenoble? Yes. Here, see? That?s me, with him. - How did you two meet? - In the hotel. - Congratulations. - No, I mean the hotel where I work. - I?m a chambermaid. - What hotel? - The Three Crowns Hotel, in Coffin. - What did you say? - Nothing. - The name of the place? - Coffin. - Did Vesnourian come to see you often? Of course he did. - Good heavens! Coffin... - Well it?s about time. May I help you, Miss? I come about this doll. It must be faulty. One moment, please. Miss? Good morning, Sir, I come about this doll... - Is the moon green? - What? I?m asking you if the moon is green? I really don?t know, Sir... I come about the doll. What?s the matter, doctor? - Would you please follow me... - I think it?s useless now. Hands up! Bravo! My deepest congratulations! You played your part perfectly. Search this joint and make it snappy! Oh, there?s nothing in this one. Not in all of them. A microfilm here and there... Mum?s the word. It?s as safe as a diplomatic bag, you know. The doll you found was about to leave for Moscow via Berlin with a detailed account of NATO?s last session. What about Vesnourian?s list? Where is it? I?ve got my ideas about that. But... where is Stanislas? This is a great car you have. You?re faster than the train. I?m in a hurry. Just like Vladimir. He was always in a hurry, Vladimir was. Oh, here it goes again! I?m fed up with this! CERCUEIL (coffin) WELCOMES YOU. VISIT ITS CASTLE, CHURCH, BELL-TOWER AND SWIMMING POOL. So, it?s understood: you never saw me before - and you talk to me only if I talk to you first. - Yes, sir. - Everyone in the hotel must ignore who I am. - Yes, Mr Stanislas. Good. - I?d like a room, please. - We?re almost full, Sir. - Do you require a bathroom? - Well... - Aren?t you Mr. Dubois? - Yes I am. - Perfect. Anastasie! - Yes, madam. Would you please escort the gentleman to Room 5. Yes, madam. Mrs. Dubois is waiting for you. She checked in barely an hour ago. But... but how... but... what are you saying? - Hello? - I?m not married! Yes, this is the Three Crowns Hotel. No problem, Sir, we?re used to it. Yes... Oh, we?re almost full, Sir. Would you like a bathroom? Very well, Sir. Yes. Come in, darling. How was your trip? Will you explain yourself? What does this act mean? - Listen to me before you get mad. - No, first: what are you doing here? - In my bed? - I beg your pardon, it?s mine. A couple of travelling tourists is less conspicuous than a man alone. So here I am! I?m your alibi! - Alibi... All right! - You must admit it?s not a bad idea. You?re right. I?d even say it?s an excellent idea. You see... You see, I do make amends. You?ll sleep here. You?ll be quite cosy, unless you prefer moving into the tub. - Thank you. - I?m hungry. - B?n?dicte, I drink your health. - Thank you. And I yours. Oh, stop! Don?t drink! Oh, Stanislas... Good evening, little ones. Good night. - And now, chaps, let?s get to work! - Yes sir! - Good Morning, madam! - Good morning, madam! Good morning, little darling. She?s hungry. Will you settle over there, madam? - Good morning, Sir. - Good morning, madam. Good morning, Sir. Did you sleep well? Oh, yes I did! Could I have some very strong coffee? Certainly. - Good morning, Sir, did you sleep well? - With one eye open, madam. Just one. - My dear chap! What a coincidence! - You, here? To what serendipity do I owe... I needed a break. You know how the Parisian life is, the traffic, the noise... I felt I needed to immerse myself again in your beautiful French countryside. - Sounds logical. - But what about you, my dear chap? Shh. A sentimental journey. Good morning, sir, did you sleep well? - Thank you. - Good. Oh, no, take care, it?s not very.. Strong, Sir, please excuse me. - Do you realise what you did? - Not at all! Didn?t you notice anything on your way here? Didn?t you even see you were being followed? - Well? - Frankly, no. There was a pack of them behind you. - What?s the matter, for God?s sake? - Don?t scream, or else... You dirty bully you! Just one piece of information. Tell me where your boyfriend left his personal stuff. - Vladimir? How should I know? - Too bad. Then you?ll stay here, without food or water, until you remember. Ham! And a good little beer. Do you like beer? Can you see the good sandwich? Very fresh. No? Rosine has disappeared. - Rosine has disappeared. - Maybe she?s run away. Meanwhile, I worked for you. Here is the hotel?s register. There are thirty rooms. Thirty, yes, but only two are of any interest to me. - The one Vesnourian used and Rosine?s... - Which he used too. It?s very simple. Look. Number 9: Vesnourian, Vladimir, traveling salesman, and, one week earlier... wait... here: number 9 again. There?s nothing here, my dear Dubois. Psst! Hey! Come here! - Do you know where we are? - In a hotel, of course. In a house... a "house where people meet". I know what I?m saying. Look: Vaudon, the antique dealer, remember? Come on, B?n?dicte, maybe he was with his wife. What about this one? I know him and he?s a bachelor. - He?s a minister. - Oh? Indeed. - Ah! Daddy! - No? It?s him all right: Mr. Rameau! He didn?t even change his address. - I really don?t blame him. - What with his heart! Stanislas! Stanislas! Stanislas, come quickly! B?n?dicte, if you mean to inform me that another member of your family - used to come here... - Of course not. I think I found what you?re looking for. All the more reason not to shriek like that. Where? What are your saying? Vesnourian wanted to sell the Colonel the list of all his accomplices, didn?t he? - Yes he did. - Then... look at those two pages of the year 1958. Daddy is still the cause of this: I wanted to know if he?d been doing that for a long time. Anyway those two pages were obviously added to the book. Can you see how they?ve been glued? And you won?t have me believe that a Mr Bannister from New York came here for a week-end at the same time as a Mr. Popov from Leningrad and... This is extraordinary. One hundred names among one thousand others. Good thinking. My dear chap, would you be so incredibly kind as to face the wall? I?d be sorry to hurt such a pretty woman. As your good La Fontaine used to say: - "The reason of the strongest is always.. " - "... the best. " Don?t move. Don?t move. Reach for the sky. Keep on not moving. Drop your gun! Go there! Back! Or I shoot! - What?s going on? - But... but... Thank you. Sorry. He?s in the kitchen! - May I help you, Sir? - The bathroom? - It's there! - Oh, good, thank you. Scotland Yard for you. Hey! Hey! Join me in the garage, hurry up! - Right. - I?ll take your car. Ouch! My head... - May I make a phone call? - Certainly, Sir. What number do you require? Hello? Please hold the line. - It?s for you, Sweetheart. - Thank you, darling. Hello, hello? Hello? Morin: will you book for me two seats on the plane to... To Tahiti. Tomorrow, I?m going on a holiday.
