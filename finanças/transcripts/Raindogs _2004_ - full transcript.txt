Way I see it is this- - I'm not fucking interested in the way you see it, we get caught with this fucker, we get 10 years. - What's the matter with you bastard? Fucking hell, dude, do you wanna abort the whole fucking deal? Guys let's look at this sensibly. One, if we destroy the painting we get fucking paid. Two, we don't destroy it but we say we did, we still get paid. The only way we're not gonna get paid is if that fucking painting shows up before next week. And it's not gonna happen, is it? - Well it won't, no. Not unless someone gets greedy, eh. - Okay, Let's burn the fucker. - Yes. - [Edward] Oh shit. - [James] Here, you're the goalie. - [William] Come on, over here, here ya are. - What the fuck? We've been scammed, William, wake it up you dozy fucker. - What does it say? - Cheapskate bastard. - Read it to me. - The painting has not been insured to the value of its estimated worth. - What? - Fucking knew it was too good to be fucking true. - Shut up. - The insurance company has said that only about three million will be paid out if it's not recovered. - Jesus. - What the fuck has Jesus got to do with it? [whistling] [relaxed jazz music] - What was the exact wording of the deal, Charles? - 10% of the insurance claim payout. - Well you offered me 750 grand Edward. - I'll get in touch with the Duke's men. - Yeah, those fucking rich bastards are all the same, mate. They don't care about the fucking little man, I tell you. [all laughing] Fucking cockroach crawling cunt. - [Edward] For fuck sake man, hit the fucker. - You got something to fucking say, boy? - You're a fucking nutter. - Got something to fucking say? I'm just sick of all of his fucking bullshit, mate. That's all I get from any of you boys. And we're supposed to be buddies. - We were only playing golf. - Well I hate it, it's only a fucking hole. - Calm down mate, relax man. Anyway we're all on the same fucking side here, it's cool. - Okay, so this is a blow in, right? No 750 grand, it's a blow. - I'm just as hacked off as you are. Except I'm taking it out on that stupid fucking white ball. - Yeah I'm sorry Edward, I am. I lost it there, and I've never played golf before. - You fucking liar. Told this lassies last night he had no handicap and had eight holes in one. - Yeah well, I weren't talking about golf. - Boy's a natural. - Gimme some fucking air here, guys. - Charles just remind me how this works again mate because surely the cops gonna be reading the Duke's emails? - We use encryption software, William. We communicate using Hotmail addresses that can be logged on remotely with a laptop and a phone line. - Has he replied? - The Duke's agent, no. But I've told him we're not leaving Scotland 'til the transfer goes through. - So what now? - [Edward] We just keep on the move. - [Charles] I've arranged to pick up two new cars in the morning. We'll travel in pairs to our next location. - [William] Oh, we've got to be cool. The cops will know by now that there's four of us. - If anyone asks what you do, your car dealers taking a week's vacation to hunt and fish. - [James] Fish with what? - You'll be supplied with the right gear tomorrow. - What about clothes? - It's all been taken care of. - If we're gonna get caught, it's gonna happen over the next few days, okay? You don't ask each other personal questions, you don't make calls to your friends, and you do not pick up girls. - Of course. Our phones are off and our lips are sealed. - Alright, good. - So who's taking the Leonardo then? - Well what about highest card takes it? Is that alright? Jamesy. - Fucking hustler. [soft music] What is it with all this fucking cloak and dagger stuff? - Look mate, why don't we just make the best of it? Tell you what, let's stop for a drink and then I'll organize us a fun night in. - Seems a good idea, mate. [soft music] - Have you ever had these deals go wrong before? - Nope, I've always been paid half up front and the rest on delivery. But then again, they've all been small jobs compared to this one. - Really didn't think there'd be such a fucking fuss about it. - We're unlucky, we did it on a day when nothing else happened. No bombings, no wars, nothing. - What is it with the press? - It's the Leonardo factor. Guy's been making headlines since the 16th century. - Victoria, yeah no I'm in a fucking payphone somewhere, no mobiles don't work up here darling. Listen, you coming over? Good, nice, yeah, you gotta be there by eight though. Yeah, alright listen, I want you to bring three friends with ya. Yeah, no, no, I don't wanna see that fucking bird. Alright, yeah that'll do.

Look, you're a nice guy, but if you're mixed up with William you'll be into some weird shit, I just did this for the money. - [Edward] How much? - 200. - I'll give you another 200 if you'll see me again.

You better just hope your dick doesn't fall off before you get back to the wife. - [Edward] That's three days in a row we've been on the front page. - [Charles] Have they any more clues about us? - Uh-huh, found the first car we've abandoned. - That was on the cards. It was a hot car with false plates, they won't be able to trace it back to us. - Good, the client'll feel safe. - They'll still need proof that we've destroyed the painting before they'll pay up. - Yeah we'll do it when we get back, send them a bit of the canvas in tonight's post. - I'll let them know. - Good, all this hanging around makes me nervous. - Me too. [whistling] [relaxed jazz music] - Piece of piss. At least there's no fucking lousy midges at this time of the year, mate. - James, can I ask you a personal question? - No personal questions, orders. - Oi, listen who got you out of the fucking trouble mate? You were supposed to hide the painting, remember? It's just as well that bird was fucking out of it, or we'd have had to top her. From now on I'm looking after the painting. - You're a fucking drama queen. So you saved my ass, big wow. What the fuck have you done with the painting then? - Well why don't you answer my personal question and I'll show ya. - What is this, the fucking "Weakest Link"? - James I mean, I thought we were buddies and it hurts. - You're a fucking pain. - And I know that means you love me. - Like a pimple on my dick. What's the fucking question? - All it is, is what was that Mary like? - That's not a fucking question, that is a fucking liberty. - Yes, so tell me. Come on, how'd she take it. - [blows] Front, back, in, out, fucking up, down. Any way you want mate. - I knew it, I fucking, the moment I saw that girl man I fucking knew she was up for it. - You're a fucking pervert. - Yes. - So what have you done with the painting then? - Well, I put it somewhere safe. It's for our guarantee of getting a fair and equitable share of the money. - You should trust Charles and Edward. Cool mate. - Yeah, listen, that Charles is on the verge of a fucking breakdown, alright. Pretty soon he's gonna be totally unpredictable and I assure you that's the last thing we want from a fucking ops man. - I'm telling you William, right, 15 pound line, it doesn't jut fucking snap on you like that man, the thing must have been a fucking monster. - You're just the fucking bag men, what have you done with it? - Boys, let's have a drink. - Don't fucking test me, William. - It's not fucking funny, William. - There's no one laughing, Edward. Funny though, James and I were just talking about you two. - Don't fucking look at me like that. I just want to know what the fuck's going on here. - Fucking tell him, Edward. - They're sticking to giving us 10%. - How much is that? - 300 grand. - What each? - No between us. - Oh so that's less than a hundred grand each then. - 75,000, minus five grand each for operation costs. - You're fucking kidding us. - What kind of life is 70,000 gonna buy you, Charles? - Yeah exactly, that is fucking shit. - And we'll get nothing if we don't send the proof that we've destroyed the Leonardo. - Oh for fuck's sake, what's the fucking matter with you? Fucking put that away. You're supposed to be the brains ain't ya? The fucking business head, you, the fucking one with the leverage. - A deal's a deal, William. We made a gentleman's agreement, 10% of the insurance claim payout, whatever it is. - Yeah, right, but we're not fucking gentlemen are we, Charles? We're fucking crooks. - D'you know, even I think yous are a pair of fucking morons. We've got the fucking painting. So just for all our sakes remind us how much the fucking thing is valued at. - 30 million. - And they wanna give us 300 grand. - Is that taking the piss or what? - This is what we're gonna do. We're gonna sell the painting back to them. - What? - You're nuts. - You're gonna do the negotiation. You're gonna Hotmail these fucking idiots and you're gonna explain to them that we are selling the painting back to them for one and a half million. This is fair, it means we get half of our original deal and they get to keep half of their insurance claim. - They'll never go for that. - Would you like to bet on it? - I like it. - You're gonna go along with this shit? - 70,000 is fuck all, Charles. - How are you gonna get 'em to pay us a million and a half. Because we got the painting, Charles. The painting's valued at 30 million pounds, alright, and they've got an insurance claim with three million. But they only get that insurance claim if we don't send the painting back to them, 'cause if we did then they'd get nothing. - If I was them I'd forget about the fucking insurance claim, sell the painting at auction for 30 million. - Everything the duke owns is in trust. Technically he owns nothing, he's not allowed to sell anything. - Well then a million and a half's a good deal for him and he gets his painting back. - He could collect the payout then sell the painting to a private collector. - A client of mine did that. The private collector ran it through a stolen property register, then bought in the FBI and Interpol. My client got three years. - Did he get his painting back? - No, the FBI sold it at a knock-down price to cover the investigation costs. Guess who bought it? - Private collector. - Oh, of course. - It's up to us, right? Because whether we send it back, or whether we destroy it, it's our call. - I'm in. - I'm in too. - You're a bunch of lunatics. - Charles, set up a meeting with the Duke's man. - Where? - Somewhere that the cops and the insurance investigators can't tail him. Right boys, where's the painting. - Yes William, what have you done with it? Lovely. - Feel better you motherfuckers? Good, you'll be buying the drinks then, won't ya? [energetic guitar music] [all chattering] [woman giggles] - Oh, it's your shot. - Couple of fucking morons. - I couldn't agree with you more. - What, you're not with them then? - No, never seen 'em before in my life.

He then drives on about 30 miles to the next station and waits there to pick me up. - Why aren't we needed? - Well we need to draw as little attention to ourselves as possible, don't we? Also it might be a trap. The insurance company could have found out about the Duke's scam, to cover his tracks he might be working with them and the cops to recover the painting. We just don't know. - Someone also needs to stay with the Leonardo. - Okay. - You're a lot younger than I expected. I'm Brown. - No names please. Where's the Duke? - You don't think he'd agree to meet a criminal? - It's a bit rich, isn't it? - Look here, how dare you make demands on His Grace, he's a very important man. - Cut to the chase, Lady Jane. - My god, how do you know my real name? - It's my job. Are you gonna give us a million and a half or not? - We certainly are not, we agreed 10%. Against my advice, His Grace has agreed to let you have 20% but not a penny more. - I hope you've thought it through.

There's a quiet place up north but we're not booked in there for another two days. - What's happening with the money? - We have got to get a direct line to the Duke. I don't fucking trust Brown, she's a fucking Roedean girl. She'd turn us in to save her own neck, I fucking know it man. - I need a fucking drink. - Anyone ever tell you that you are a fucking alcoholic? - What the fuck happened here anyway? - Why don't you ask the fucking terminator over there?

You have to turn over the copy first. - Then what? - Then meet us here in four hours. - You should be aware, we're photographing you.

[ethereal music] - So we have to go back to the castle where we stole the fucking painting from in the first place? - That is right. - And take the fucking Leonardo? - Yes. - And have a fucking conversation with the fucking owner Duke? - The Duke was a colonel in the paras. - Fucking paras, everybody in the army knows the paras are a bunch of fucking nancies. Who knows what the old cunt might be planning. - I wouldn't worry about it too much, he ain't been clever up to know, has he? - Yeah, maybe we're just being fucking paranoid, eh? He's gonna get out the fucking cheese and biscuits. - Just shut up. Right, let's get out of here. - [James] I still don't see how we're gonna get any more fucking money out of them. - The idea is to steal the painting, James you fucking moron. - Oh, well I thought we'd already stole the fucking painting. - James, do you just never listen, mate? - Yeah, but what I hear doesn't make fucking sense. - Right, let's get down to it. Now, I'm not gonna mess about. Call the police, will you Jane? - I've no signal, sir. - What? - I've no signal. - Well go in the other room, use the land line. So, you thought you could blackmail me, did you? Speak up. - I think you're fucking mad. - What, what did you say? - He said you're mad. - Oh and you're not? The deal was 10% of the insurance payout, you've had 20% and now you want more. - The deal was three million, that means you're almost two and a half million short. How much is that worth? - It's the oldest trick in the book. I was in the parachute regiment. [tense music] - Police'll be here in 15 minutes, sir. - Excellent, is that the copy? Good, you get it Jane, would you? That means we can charge you with trying to pass a forgery for the insurance reward, that should give you about our years each, I should say. Will you check their pockets, Jane. - Well when the police do get here, I think you should reconsider what you're gonna tell them. - Oh do you, well I'm not going to reconsider a damn thing. Ah, what's that an eight millimeter? That means we can have you for possession of a firearm, that'd be another five years each I should think.

[whistling] [relaxed jazz music] [engine revs] - "The tragic events of last night reveal a complex set of circumstances. The Duke was found dead with his secretary, Lady Jane Brown. It is thought that they had a lovers quarrel and that Lady Jane shot the Duke, then took her own life with the same gun. Beside their bodies lay the Leonardo da Vinci painting, valued at 30 million pounds, spectacularly stolen only 10 days ago. However, the one unanswered question for the police is the copy of the famous painting found hanging in the room where the original was displayed prior to its theft. Staff report hearing the sound of a car arriving and leaving before and after the sound of gunshots. One of the estate workers also saw torch light in the woods, earlier in the evening. The Duke was much loved and will be sorely missed by all who knew him to be one of Scotland's most honorable men." - Yeah right. - Oi, have a little charity, the fucker is dead. - Aye, and Lady Jane. Cut down in her fucking prime, man. - So why didn't you just take the Leonardo? - As far as the police are concerned, the case is closed, they're not gonna be looking for anyone else. - So why did we have to put the painting back? - It was our insurance in case the Duke tried to turn us over to the police. It wouldn't have looked too good for him when the tour guides found it. The painting that we took to him was your photograph of Lady Jane. - Yous two are real smart fuckers, guys, man. - Cheers. - I've gotta give you it, man.
