Would feel like listening Illayaraja's s See if this is the song. ♪ What's the color that arise in your hea when the breeze caress you? ♪ ♪ What's the thought in your mind when the moon shines? ♪ Sir, we are going to commit a murder but these guys are rejoicing. "What's the thought in your mind when the moon shines?" You said you doesn't want to involve in this, then why should you come, boss? Some murders are good to be heard. Some murders are good to witness. I want to see him being murdered. Mike, where is my brother? Hey, open it... open it... Hey, would brother have reached Mumbai now? He'd have reached, boss. No Guna, shall we go to Mumbai as said by brother? We have just arrived. Hey, get down and bring him. Hey, switch off the light. Go, do the work I said. I couldn't bear the atrocity of this rat everyday. Though all the holes in the house are sh I don't know how this damn is coming. Hey, are you going to come out or not? Oh, no! Please brother! It's getting late to college, brother. Mom, see here. He isn't coming out. Ask him to step out. Don't you know to get ready early in the morning? You sleep for hours competing with him and fighting to use toilet in the mornin Hey Porus, come out. Kanchu dear, can't you tell your husband to find a... double bedroom house with attached toilet? I'll tell him. Here is your brother, tell him. Who? Him? Damn it, move away. Hey... Get lost. You're forgetting that you're talking to future Sub-Inspector of Police. I'm sure to punish you someday. You can't do anything, get lost. Mom, serve me breakfast. I'm hungry. Here is the plate. Have sambar. - Thank you. Hey, what pride in saying that you're going to be a SI? Just you've written the exam, right? You'll be a SI only after passing the ex completing training and getting posting. What will you do even if you become a SI You'll just order, "Constable, buy veget "Constable, get me tea" "Constable, take the complaint ". Hey, I'm not like the SI as you think. I'm the SI of Crime branch. Shall I tell you a good crime story? Listen carefully. Tell me. There has been a murder in a house. If I had witnessed that murder, how'd you interrogate me? Come on, proceed. Okay, hey what did you see there? Hey... Sorry, what did you see there? That's it. There were two corpses in the house. One was alive and the other is dead. The living corpse has killed the other. I can't understand. I'll tell you clearly, listen. When a man dares to kill another, then he is a corpse, isn't it, sir? Okay, how did he kill? That is... Oh, no! By stabbing with knife. You goof, what question is that? Ask him why did he kill? You prove that you're a cop's wife. Very good. Okay, you tell me, Why did he kill? Just for two reasons. One, he must've been emotional and killed him. Else, he should've killed for profit. What's the difference between the two? Mom, we both indulge in fight. When you slap me, if I stab you with knife in anger... Hey, no! I acted like stabbing... - Keep the knife down. This is a murder done emotionally without my knowledge. The other, with the decision to kill you upon planning, Tying your hands, slashing your neck with a knife, killing you like a psycho. Hey, both are murders before law. That's not. - What? The first murderer has some humanity. The second murderer was a beast without any mercy. The one who murdered with no other way to save himself... And the one who murdered others for his livelihood... there are lot of differences between the two. Rather than finding a crime, From what point of view we see it is the qualification of a good cop I thi Hey!!! My son! A cop! - Enough... enough... It's getting late to college.

Definitely she will not. Sir, this letter was in your daughter's notebook. All the students in the school say it was given by him. But when enquiring your daughter, she isn't uttering anything. Ask her to accept that they gave this letter, I'll give TC and send both of them out. He gave you the letter, right? Don't tell... don't tell... I'm asking you to tell me. Yes, dad! He only gave me. Hey, she disclosed about us. You said it's an eternal love. First, give TC to both of them. Hey, both of you come here. Come fast. Look at them. Show your hand. But last week I gave him a letter. He just replied me for it. Paneer, your daughter has accepted, right? Better unite them. Are you old enough? You're just in high school. You're not grown up yet.

You mean one lakh? Which company? Swiggy. Is it the food delivery company? - Yes. Are you proud of it? What other work would you feel proud of? I need a permanent job and a permanent income. I need hope that he will take care of my daughter well and good. If so, he should join politics. I don't need that either. Hey, keep the dosa. Get up. I'll bang you on face. Get up. I'm watching you from my childhood. You find an excuse and always try to separate them. Dude, you both will not get married until he is alive. I'll kill him and go to prison. You marry her and stay happy. Take your hands off from his shirt. "There are millions of women but my eyes are only on you" "Hey come on, attack me!" - She too is irritating. Dude, did you get it? It's on the way. I didn't ask about it. I'm asking did you get an idea? Shall I tell you an idea? Look, I don't wish to see Paneer anymore So? Let's do the operation. Oh, no! Operation?

Enough of looking there. Go upstairs. Go... Ask aunty to bring coffee. Sir! - What? Who are these people? Plumber, going to give connection. Are you creating nuisance in home? Wait, I'll call the police. Hey, get me the phone. Look Paneer, why do you get angry in old age? Take this, this is my number. Call the police. Don't humiliate us. Open the door. Scoundrel, why did you come here? Dear, come and ask him. Mythili. Hey... hey... What are you doing? Oh, no! Paneer... See, how wonderfully she dragged him inside and locked the door! You can't do anything hereafter. What are we going to do now? A guy is sitting outside, isn't it? He must flee out of fear. For that sake, Do whatever you want. Can I do anything? Shall we start? Mythili! - Hey, this is wrong. Oh, no! Mythili! Why are you humiliating us? Open the door, Mythili. Shouldn't do all this before marriage. - Oh, no! Parents are there outside. - Oh, god!

We have to decide. Don't pollute the air we breathe! You're saying that you will all fast till death, isn't it legally wrong? Is it fair to run a factory and kill lakhs of people? When did all your politics and law stood with the common people? Politics and law are for the people all over the world. But only here, people are for politician and to those in power. Sir, you can take the child to the hospital for treatment, isn't it? Treatment? No chance. Anyway, I'm going to die. None of the other children of my age should die.

If one teacher can't teach all subjects, How can one student learn all subjects? How is it? If you send me disgusting messages like this, Wait, I'll block your phone number. Do it. - Get lost. You get lost. I have fought to the core to raise aware among the people against this factory. I cannot. They ask me for the evidence. My son is the evidence. He has blood cancer. For that? Will you continue fasting until he dies? Only when someone dies you people come to us with a mic. The smoke emanating from this factory is mixed with the air we breathe. We breathe 10% of toxic air. The waste from the factory got mixed in the canal and devastated our town on the It's hydrogen content has increased by 8 to 10%. Do you know what will happen if it exceeds 10%? What is Sodium hydrosulphate? Search in Google to know it's impact. How can a country prosper without a factory, sir? Are you all from Chennai? - Yes, sir. Who was on the banks of the river Coovum in Chennai fifty years ago? Poor people. Who are there now? Still the same people, sir. Where did your development go?

If they don't come? - If they don't come, we will fight till We will fight! We will fight! We will fight till death. Look, the Chief has great respect for you and your family. Don't spoil your name at the time of getting an MP seat. Atleast, take care until the interview g This one topic is enough for the opposition party and the media. They will tarnish you. Make a decision soon on Parisutham's matter. I'm smart. I'm waiting for the moment to hit him. You don't have to worry about few people. If they get another message tomorrow, they'll forget about this. Take care that the count of four shouldn't become four thousand. You alone is not smart, he too acts smart regarding this issue. Dad! While your dad was begging for money on the streets, The Chief gave me this factory to survive. What came after that was all this money, power and influence. This is the root of our family. The dignity. Letting this factory go out of our hands and the death of your father are the sam There are many kinds of humans. Some live since they were born. Some people live without knowing what they're living for. And some live for ambition. Only a few live for dignity. Dignity is your father's life. Dad, I'll save your dignity even at the cost of my life. Don't worry. Hey, where will he be now? The Chemicals - It was invented by man to save the human race. But today it has grown to the point of destroying the mankind. The reason beyond this is politics and p The moment production starts in a factory... The air gets toxicated. It's waste is discharged not only into... river, lake and pond but also into groundwater. We cultivate food crops in that water. In the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the food we eat... This chemicals will somehow reach the human, the science says. Today everyone is living with a disease. We have left only medicines to next generation. Please stop it. A single person... In order for a single person to live... He made the entire town as graveyard. Everyone is just watching quietly. The reason is, he has power and money. God is not going to come from heaven to save us. We have to save ourselves. Is it certain that what happened to my c will not happen to your child in future? Are we going to let our future generation live or die? You all think well. I don't want money or power to defeat Neduncheziyan. It's enough if you all stand with me. I'll win over him. Will you be with me? Hey, come. He is talking crazily. Who? Is he crazy? Get lost. We will come behind you. You step forward boldly. We will come behind you. We will come along! We will come along! Neduncheziyan, down! down! He has started to gather people. Neduncheziyan, down! down! You've gathered people. Will he leave you if he knows? What will he do? Will he kill me? Let him kill me. I'm just a mosquito. I'm a victim affected by them. I'll fight as long as I can. Tomorrow a lamb will be affected. So, it'll fight as long as it can. Some day, a lion will be affected. They can kill the mosquito, lamb, dog and wolf. But they can't kill the lion. Hey, Porus! Tell me, dude! Sister is crying downstairs. Ask her what's the reason. Come. Hey, what happened?

I was scared. Did you come to see if she is alive or dead? She is still alive, dad. You'll kill her yourself, dad. You said that nothing bad will happen to us if we don't harm anyone. See, she tried to commit suicide. You can't save your family. Brother! Why are you a cop? Go and be a yes-man to your higher official. Go... Dad, please stay. Dad! Somehow save my daughter, sir. I'll take care, Ponnu. Is she fine? How can she, sir? Though a cop, I'm a sinner who couldn't save my own family. Don't say like that. I'll take action. Do the needful, sir. I'll take care, go. I'm leaving, sir. (Indistinct voices) Sir, somehow save my daughter. Sir, you've given the complaint, right? I'll take care. The Government is paying us to serve you all. You go without fear. Okay. - Go... Hello! Sir, a girl's father has given a complaint on your son. It's just a complaint, right? Leave it, let's see. Sir, she hanged herself. What do you say? Yes, sir. Just a minute. You leave. Come when I call you. - Okay, sir. Is the girl dead? No... no... she is out of danger. Did you file a FIR? Not yet, sir. But if the media knows, you'll be the headlines today. What's the name of the girl? Divya, sir. Her father's name is Raghupathy. He is working in the crocodile farm at ECR. Okay, leave it. I'll look to it. Brother! What? Inspector wants to talk with you. Give me. Tell me, sir? Who gave the complaint? No, sir. I reprimanded my brother. He wouldn't have done that. Look Selvam, I'm getting pressure from higher authorities to kill you. That's why, I caught a guy from your clan... tortured him and made him as an approver against you. The police department is awaiting to kill you. At this moment, your brother was caught in a girl's case. That too, a cop's daughter. If FIR is filed in this case, not just m no one else can save you. What should I do now, sir? Somehow go for compromise. Plead them and make them to withdraw the case. You can earn money again if you lose, Selvam. Will the life comeback again? Life is more important, Selvam. Parisutham. Is it my only job to see what's he doing That's my property for generations. I'd not even allow a brick to be taken out from it. If anything happens to him, we have to face that case. For that? Are you telling me to fall at his feet? Sir, we need the factory. Which house? - At 3rd floor. Where is Guna? - He is here. Greetings! I'm Neduncheziyan. You go to mom. Come here, dear. - Mom! Greetings, sir. Why did you come here? Come, sir. Let's go inside and talk. Take this fruits. What are you looking at? Yeah, I'm a rowdy. But I have come now to make a compromise. Hey, you've done everything and what's there to compromise? Take all this and get out. - You be quiet. I plead you, please go out. Listen me, please go. Give me your phone. Here it is, dad. Do you've any other copy? No, dad. See here, we have only this one. No other footage with us. Guys have done something naughty. If we the elders exaggerate this, won't it be like we ruined the lives of our children ourselves? Which is naughty, sir? My daughter hanging herself seems naughty to you? Except for each other, we don't have anyone else. I can't withdraw the case, sir. Let's do what the court says. Please you leave, sir. There is no danger to anyone because of my company. People will write something on Facebook and in dailies. None of that is true. If there isn't any problem in the factory... why have you come in search of my house and talking now? Many families are living because of my company. Are you telling to spoil their lives? You're deceiving all by saying you've given jobs to many people. Millions have been affected, do you know that? This place will be deserted where the next generation cannot live. The politicians, the ruling party or the opposition party... Does anyone open their mouth except you? They might've some benefit from you. Why are they going to open their mouth? People are innocent. Before they know what's going on here, You'll wipe out everything from here and go somewhere else. We have to suffer here till the end. Let me do onething. I'll give treatment for your son in Singapore. I'll settle your life. Let's get compromised. What do you say? Call Guna. Hey, how dare you enter my house? You must be stabbed... - Hey, Porus! Leave me, mom. - Don't be furious. Leave it. - Grab the knife. Dude, I'm saying you, stab this dog here itself. You've all the rights. Sir, no need of the case. Your department is awaiting to arrest me. When he troubled your daughter, not obeying me... he'll no longer be in this area, not even in this town. Henceforth there won't be any problem to your family because of him. I have decided to send him to Mumbai. We won't withdraw the case. Whatever it is, let's see at the police station. Take all these and better leave now. He is saying, isn't it? You all leave. Listen to me. Go... Look here, sir. I never meant what the guys did was right. Yes, it was wrong. If FIR was filed in this case... then the dailies and social media will screw your daughter. I too have a daughter. Today your daughter just made a suicide attempt. You saved her. If all this is revealed, She will definitely commit suicide. Then, no one can save her. That's why I'm telling. Let's get compromised. Hereafter, these guys will never see your daughter. I assure it. What's your call, sir? Hey, take the footwear. Brother? Hey, take it. Sister, take it. Hit him with footwear before me. Then only he'll get sense. And of course my anger will subdue. Hit him. What are you looking at? Hit him. Divya, hit him. Hit him with footwear. Parisutham, proceeding this case legally will never come to end. Give me. Each card has twenty five lakhs. Just retain it now for your expenses. What's the pin number? 88-88 Oh, it's a fancy number. 88-88 Mom! Get out. Park the vehicle aside. To our status, we shouldn't have gone to his house, boss. The media has made him very popular now. If you touch him now... If I touch... - You can't be an MP. You'll lose fame among the people. Dude, listen me. Let's leave this matter now. What to do? Shall we have fun playing cricket? I spoke to her for your sake. Will your father give her footwear and ask her to hit me? If I leave it, my brother will spit on my face. What do you want to do now? What's he upto? Hey, Guna! Brother will say for sake of your goodness. What do you want to do now? I have decided to abduct her. I'll abduct her definitely. Ask Ravi to come. Let's abduct Parisutham.

Unable to bear the death of your daughte he committed suicide by cutting off his That dog who is responsible for your daughter's death... was well aware of the consequences of getting caught to the police. He got surrendered in the court. Ponnu. - Sir! Now you've only one son, take care of him well. There's nothing in my hands, sir. What's going to happen if I lament? My daughter is dead. How am I going to live hereafter? Oh, God!!! Of the two children he had, he lost one. Only you're there for him now. Take care of your family Aunty, If you're broken down, who will console us? Atleast to cry, you need strength. First you eat. No need. Even uncle didn't eat from yesterday. Uncle! Uncle, atleast you eat. I have killed my daughter myself. On that day, when my daughter called "dad" on phone, my gut got shattered. I'm feared of my son Porus now. He is wandering around like a lunatic for two days. Tell him to leave everything. What did dad say? Asked me to leave everything? Yes. Since he told me to give up everything, we lost Dwaraka now. But I won't leave, Mythili. When Guna comes out, his death is in my hands. For this angry attitude, all are afraid something might happen to you. Even I'm afraid to see you now. No need, please leave it. Can I say something, Mythili? Good people win and bad people lose happens only in mythology and cinema. We can never expect life to be like that. To save ourselves from a rabid dog, we can't even throw a stone on it. Because Blue cross and everyone else will come. But if a person is stabbed on midst of the road, No one will come to rescue. This society is accustomed to stoop to power, money and politics. If we have the power and money, we can do anything, Mythili. We can never be afraid of police, law and court. Don't go this side, a rowdy is there. Don't go this side, a murderer is there. Don't fight with a rowdy, then you'll become a rowdy. Let's withdraw the case and get compromised. Because I need to become a cop, isn't it He named his son Porus but nothing should happen to me. We are all going to die some day, Mythil Why isn't he understanding that? I'll die if I fight against him else wouldn't I die? The question here is not whether to live or die. Are we just watching or fighting? It's decided we are going to die, so it's better to fight and die. She is dead. What's the use of crying anymore? Even Lord Buddha will get angry, if he lives amidst them. I'm an ordinary man, if I don't fight, they'll kill us too. Tell me, dude. First, watch the Television. Why? All the news channels are broadcasting information about our siste What are you saying? - Just watch. What happened? In the murder case of a young woman named Dwaraka, As she deceived on fake love and grabbed money, Guna has surrendered in the court alleging that he had murdered her. As a sudden twist in that case... Another young man, Faizal who was deceived by her... Has committed suicide at 6.35 in the morning at Chennai. -Maybe if Dwaraka had called to my phone -Shall I go home and bring my phone? The time is already 7, shall I leave? God, somehow the girl should be found. On that day? Tell me, Porus. Have you got Faizal's autopsy report? Yes. Can you check and tell me the time of his death? I'll check now and tell you. Dear. - Tell me, uncle. He passed away exactly at 6:35. At 6.35? Uncle, it was 7 o'clock when you said that sister is dead. But you're telling Faizal died at 6:35. How could he commit suicide earlier, unable to bear the grief of her death? Yeah, right. Sir! - That's what, uncle... Sir, yesterday I saw two people getting through the window at back of the house. Hey, who are you? What are you doing here? Scoundrels. I'm telling you... Hey, stop! Sir, they ran away from here. Show the footage of yesterday morning. Time, brother? 6:35. See, if this is the one? Freeze it. Sir, it's them sir. Brother, zoom their faces. Just a minute. Porus, even we believed he had committed suicide, right? They made us to believe. What can we do now? Shall we go to the police? What can you expect by going to the police? Didn't you see that day, they imprisoned an innocent. They won't do anything. Won't they do anything? They've to find, right? Who else will find? We will find out. Why, I'll find out. Should we find out only after becoming a cop? I'll become a cop after I find out. Porus, listen me. The name of the person in this photo is Joseph. His hometown is Thoothukudi. He has been arrested twice in Goondas act. There are four murder cases on him. Who do you want? Is Joseph there? I'm coming from Chennai. What's the matter? Can you call Joseph, I'll talk to him. There is no one here by the name. Who is it? Don't know. He has come looking for you in a bullet from Chennai. Has he come from Chennai to meet me? He looks like a cop. Like a cop! You said he came in bullet... But didn't hear the sound of the bullet going back. Joseph. Hey, where are you going!

He credited four lakhs in my account. And told me to take two lakhs and assign the job to someone else. I just assigned the job. I'm not aware for what and why he asked me to kill him. Give me your account details. Why? - Give me. What happened? Where are you? Money has been transanctioned among many people here, Mythili. Joseph pointed at Maari. Maari pointed at Mohan. None of them knew the exact person who assigned the job. The guy in this photo is behind your whereabouts by catching up every link. Joseph is dead. He betrayed me. I don't know what to do, Mohan. I told him about you. He is coming looking for you. I have sent you his account details.

You immediately leave to Chennai. Okay, I'm coming. His next target is Ravi. Nothing should happen to Ravi. Ensure Ravi's safety. What? - Okay, sir. Granny, where is Ravi's house? Ravi's house? The house over there. Brother, which is Ravi's house? There, the second house. Come, dude. What happened? What will I do now! How did this happen? He slipped in the bathroom, got hit on the skull and died. Come, let's go. Hey, why all this? What are you thinking about? About Ravi's death? Ravi didn't die naturally. He has been killed. I don't understand. What does it mean when we go looking for someone but he dies before? What does it mean? Someone doesn't like us going in search of each person. Can you tell me in detail? Someone who doesn't want to get caught in some issue, Gave money to him and told to kill Faizal. He assigned that job to another person. He assigns the other. The other to another. Next to another person. Finally the job is done by him. Joseph! In case if he gets caught... He will betray the other person. And the next will betray the other. He will betray another one. But before he betrays the exact person, That person will kill him. You mean Ravi? Yes. Only Ravi knows who he is. Had we met Ravi today, surely he'd have been caught. They have taken such a big risk and killed Faizal. But one thing is obvious. Some big shot is behind all this. No matter who he is! No matter where he is! No matter how great he is! I'll definitely find him. What's the name of the guy? Porus. What? Porus, sir. Porus! It'll be emotional when someone dies at home. But after few days, that emotion will su and thought he'll start his routine... But instead he is going to all the places we have delt. He has no fear, sir. I'm thinking should he die at this young age? Aren't these young guys afraid of death? Wouldn't he think about his parents that they will be orphaned if he is dead Will that grave sin spare us? Sir, that isn't a problem. By confessing at the church, everything will be fine. What happened, dude? Dude, did the cops recover Faizal's phone when he died? Don't know, why? I think there might be some link between my sister's and Faizal's death. Guna has surrendered saying that he was responsible for sister's death, isn't it Damn it! - What happened? That night sister goes missing... The accident has happened when she called dad... Faizal went home to bring the phone. I blocked her number playfully. Did you think of one thing! - What? All these incidents get connected with the phone. If we get his cell phone, Then surely we'll get answer for everything. Who is having the phone? Neethirajan. With him? Then let's go to the police station. Go. (Inditinct Voices) Let's see. Why do you... Sir! Okay, I'll talk later. Sir, how did Faizal die? Suicide. How did you decide it as suicide? The Doctor has given the certificate. Sir, how many such certificates do you need? Sir, if Faizal has committed suicide then did you find the motive behind it? Sir, give me Faizal's phone. We didn't recover the phone. A death has occurred, his cell phone is missing. Two people have entered the house. Sir, how did you affirm and close this case as suicide? Keep the glass down and re-open the case, sir. Brother, I'll rather keep the glass down But like you said, I can't re-open the case. Need to inform the higher officials and they should give permission. There are certain procedures to be followed. You're going to join as a cop, and your father is a cop in this station Ask him, he will tell you. Brother, we'll handle this. But just in case, like you said if two people has entered the house, It's my responsibility to find them and bring them to justice. Sir, you can't do that. Why can't I? Because, he is already dead. As you said, I'll take up the job. But before that, I'll find out who is th reason for my sister's and the guy's dea Do you have faith in God? Yes, I have. Better pray well to god that I shouldn't find out who is the reason for all this. To hide the incident one after the other we have done four murders in a row. The MP post is the agenda for almost three generations. This vagabond shouldn't dig out anything against me. He should never think of coming before me. Then, think whether we had left any evidence of the girl. Good morning, sir. If you give him a job, he'll finish it perfectly. Here he comes. Dude, is it a success? Dude, there are lot of formalities to be followed. Rascal! Just now I was telling him great about you. Can you do or not? I can do it, dude. Then better do it. I need the details of which station limi did the crime happened... The crime number, FIR copy, a letter from the official who filed thi Only then I can officially proceed. Otherwise it's very difficult, dude. Karthi, please understand the situation. I need to know what's on that phone. Do something. Then doing it legally will be very risk, dude. Moreover, the softwares used in our department is outdated. With this software, if I try to recover even the existing files will be corrupte We sometimes outsource to private people. Hackers! They have all the advance softwares. Okay, can you find out and tell from whi cell phone tower Dwaraka last called? Hey, do you need to get permission from higher official to do this? As you seek permission for everything, then in every street a girl will die. Okay, leave it. First let's go and meet the hacker, come Tell me, brother. I need to discuss an important matter with you, bro. Brother, my granny has expired, Can we talk tomorrow? I knew about it, we're waiting outside your house now. Okay, wait. I'm coming. Okay, bro. Uncle, I'll be back soon. Tell me, bro. - Sorry, bro. An emergency, that's why bothering you now. They're my friends. - Hi, bro. Hello! - What's the matter? We need the entire communication history between his sister and her boyfriend's p How is it possible at this hour? Okay, give me your sister's phone. The phone is missing. Then it's difficult to find, bro. Hey, it's very urgent. Then ask his sister directly what messages had she sent. His sister is dead. What is the age of your granny? She is 75+ years old. His sister is 21 years old. Think of his agony. We're roaming around like lunatics without knowing the reason for her death Sorry, bro. If you had the phone, by using recovery software I'll get you the details now. But you told the phone isn't with you. Don't you know how tedious this process is! Yes we know, bro. But you can do it, bro. Please try and help us. Bro, whatever we save in the internet... Just a minute. It gets saved in the database. Those data are stored in the Cloud. Cloud is just virtual space. Hey listen, we don't understand what you say. When can you get us the details? We are doing final rituals to my granny at 7 in the morning. Shall I get you the details after the burial? Okay. Dude, Dwaraka's phone signal was last tracked at Paranur forest near Chen At Paranur forest! Mike. This belongs to Parisutham, isn't it? Let's go. -Uncle. Tell me, Porus. Apply for a petition to meet Guna at sub-jail tomorrow. Okay. Neethirajan must know this. Okay, I'll ensure. He must be a lunatic. Instead of giving up after the death... Hey, what are you murmuring? He tortures me for the death of his sister, sir. He is asking me to file a petition to meet Guna. Am I his servant? Hey, go... Porus, I conveyed the message. Thanks, uncle. Who do you want to meet? Sir, I want to meet Guna. The guy who was arrested in the girl's case? Yes, sir. He messed up our job today morning. Get down. Wash your legs and go inside. How much? - Hundred and fifty rupees. Bro! Are you waiting for a long time? That's okay. The phone details... Oh... Sorry, bro. Please wait for ten minutes, I'll take bath and try to recover. Okay. -I don't want. You've it, go. Tell me, dude. This morning, Guna bit electric wire in the prison. What are you saying! He is dead. Bro! - I'll call you back. Did you get the details? Sorry, bro. I thought this is a simple matter. Someone has hacked the server before me and deleted all the details. Someone doesn't want you to hear or see something. Sir, shall I serve one more chapati? - No, it's enough. -Sir, I hacked the server in the morning and deleted all the details, sir. No expert can recover the details from this phone. Sir, why are you still sparing him? Shall I send hooligans from other state and do something? He is a small boy, sir. What? A small boy! At Tirunelveli, sixteen people attacked Do you know that? Till now, no one got recovered from the hospital. If anyone dares to touch him, he must die. Else he will take it as lead and come he Neethi. Sir! Is the snake that chases the rat is dangerous... Or is the rat chasing a snake is dangerous? The snake is dangerous, sir. No, the rat is dangerous. The snake's prey is only one rat. But rat's prey is the entire field. Do you understand? If I spare him, he will dig proof to prove before the media. Then my whole empire will collapse. If I don't become an MP, my father would die. Until I become an MP, he shouldn't know anything about me. So I had made a plan. But what have you done! But you killed Guna and indirectly said that I was the reason for it. We set a trap to him, but he has spread the web to us. You voluntarily went and got trapped in it. Sir, are we trapped? It's you first, then him. And finally myself. Sir, isn't there any other way to escape from this? Yes, we have. We have only one solution. We have to do a murder finally. Sir, better do it. At the age of retirement, greed of money I committed a mistake. Sir, arrange for me to go back home with good name at last. Hey, hit without noise. There is interview for you at the party office tomorrow. I have included your name in the list despite many objections. Since I'm working in the Secretariat, I'm doing this help to you. Don't miss this opportunity. Okay, I'll take care of it. I have interview tomorrow morning. Today is the last day for him. Once I take up the post... The next moment, the rat must be killled. You tortured me all these days. Now you got trapped. Mom, what's this? The rat, it got trapped. Mom, what are you going to do with this? What will I do! Going to drown this in water and kill it. Mom, it's a sin. Give to me. Hey, Porus! Leave it far away from our home. Dwaraka, Faizal, Joseph, Ravi and today Neethirajan. Hey, Porus! What are you thinking about? What are you going to do now? Mythili, did you notice this? Everywhere I go, someone arrives before and destroys all the evidence. My last hope was the hacker. He tried his best and finally said he can't. No matter how big criminal he is... He'd have left a trace of evidence without his knowledge. But they aren't like others. Don't know how will I find them. You can find them. Do you know what this rat do? It digs a hole in the floor from next do and enters our house somehow. But the same rat is unable to make hole in this half inch of the wood. Do you know why? Because it's head is full of tension. Oh, no! I got caught! Too much of pressure to it. But if it thinks calmly then it can easily come out. Like the rat, you're also trapped. You think calmly. Your sister was affected. He killed a young guy. We must find him. Just think not to leave him. You'll find him. Hey Porus, the entire world will come forward to advice you. But no one will come forward to tell you a solution. You must find it out. -Maari... Maari. -He credited money in my account and asked me to kill him. -This morning, Guna bit electric wire in the prison. -Dude, Dwaraka's phone signal was last t at Paranur forest near Chengalpet. Brother, if you want a girl for intimacy Why don't you pay for it? Why did you abduct her? She was not the one we went to abduct, grandpa. But the other girl. What did you say? Yes, brother. We went to abduct the other girl. I didn't tell you because you'd scold me if you know. Hey, call all your friends. Nalla, what happened on that day? Brother, we had the video of Divya and Krishna. We threatened her, with the video. She lodged a complaint in the police station. To ask to withdraw the case, we went along with Gautham's dad. We tried our best but she didn't get convinced. We were left with no other option. Gautham's dad asked her to hit us with footwear. But she hit Ela with footwear, brother. I'm missing some voice... What voice is that? -Mom, I'll go to the medical store and come back. One more voice. -Sister went to medical store, she is yet to return. One more voice. -Yes, she came and left immediately. Still I'm missing some voice. What voice is that? I'm missing some voice. What's that? -Don't know which scoundrel has taken off the fuse carrier. My sister went to the medical store and came out. Someone has taken off the fuse carrier. Then? Hey, Gautham! how and where did you abduct her? Brother, I followed the girl. Was the girl aware of you following her? Yes, she saw me. After seeing me, she got scared and started to walk fast. I stood at corner of the street and call and told him that she is coming. Nalla, what did you do? Myself and Ela were standing in the middle of the street. When we saw Divya coming, Ela asked me to switch off the street light. I went and switched off the street light Mike, so the girl had seen Gautham. She feared that he might harm her. Out of fear, she must have looked for protection. Ela, was there any shop or house between you and that girl? Think well. There was a medical store, brother. Then surely she must have visited the store. Suppose if he goes to the store in search of any clue? Sir, the CCTV footage will show his sist going out and other girl going in with f If asked why is she scared? She will tell about our brother, sir. If our brother is caught! We all will get caught, sir. Abduct that girl before he finds her. Why is she scared while coming in? I don't know, Porus. I asked her. She said she will stand for a while and her father would come and pick her up. Then I got busy with my business. Do you know where her house is? It's near by. The fourth house in next street. Brother, is this Divya's house? Yes. The house is locked. Do you know where she went? She went to the coaching centre. Do you know where the coaching centre is? I don't know. Okay, do you know her phone number? Yes, I know. Hey, the class is very boring. We're too late today. Hey, forward me the notes. Okay, I'll forward. Okay, bye! See you. - Bye, bye. Is this the centre? - Yes, brother. What's the name of the girl? Divya. You stay back, I'll go and check. Who are you, sir? Is Divya there? She has just finished the class and left When did she leave? Just ten minutes back. Hello, Divya! Hello! Who are you? - My name is Porus. Divya, listen me carefully. Divya! Hello... hello... listen me... Hello.. hello... Divya, where are you? Please, listen to what I am saying. Hello, who are you sir? I'm not able to hear you. Divya, can you hear me? Sir, the charge is low on my phone. May I know who are you? Hello... hello... Hello! -The number you are trying to reach is currently switched off. Brother, let's not mingle in any of this issue. Guys will take care of it. This will be framed like an accident. Your job is just to identify the girl from far away. Do you understand? Understood, brother. Brother, it's her! Hey, the girl going in-front, She is the target. Kill her without any trace. Okay, brother. Hey, let's go and check. Come. Hey, she is still alive. Kill her. Divya, hope you're okay. I'll take you to the hospital. I need to know only one thing. That day in the medical store... Brother! Divya... Divya... look at me. Open your eyes. We reached the hospital, everything will be fine. Divya, look at me. Divya, why did you go inside the medical store that day with fear? I can catch them only if you say. Divya, doctors are all here. They'll save you. Nothing to worry, Divya.

We're safe. Hereafter, you'll not have any problem. The girl didn't speak anything. And she will never speak. This is the best birthday gift, brother. What more you need as your birthday gift? Now cut the cake happily, brother. "Happy Birthday to you" Happy birthday, sir... It's the best birthday gift for you, sir Thank you, Mike. Thank you. "Happy birthday to Neduncheziyan sir" -Brother, I'm going to die. -If I die, it's because of "Vedha chemic factory proprietor Nedunchezhiyan. -I was abducted by Elanchezhiyan and his friends studying in my college. -When I escaped from them, -I saw Neduncheziyan killing the social activist Parisutham. Bro... -I saw Neduncheziyan killing the social activist Parisutham. -Now they are all chasing me to kill. -I'm very scared, brother. -I retrieved it, brother. - The other day you told me.. - I retrieved it. The one who kills others for living Ã¬s a beast. -Now all those beasts are around me. -Brother, don't spare anyone. -Take care of parents. -If dad gets angry with you, please tolerate. -He likes you very much, brother. -Tell mom to take pills for diabetics without fail. -I feel sorry to leave you all. -I miss you, brother. -I miss you, brother. Oh, lord! Dwaraka! What to do now, sir? What can be done hereafter? Everything is over. I have to fight with him. No other way. Before he comes looking for me, I'll call him, that's the honor to me. Dad! If you want your dad, come to the place where your sister died. Who are you? You've to open the car door and salute me, isn't it? Because of your son's issue, we have to abduct you here. Won't your son be quiet? He is digging deeply and approaching me. What are you looking at? It's me who killed your daughter. Yes. She witnessed what she shouldn't have seen. What can I do? You bloody murderers. You killed my daughter! I curse you. Doomsday is approaching you. My son has arrived. You're dead today. Come, my dear! Porus! My son, Porus! Come, my dear! Come, my dear! Come, my dear! My son! The scoundrel who ruined our family is standing here. He tortured and killed my daughter and dares to tell me that.. Hey, come on... You were searching for me all around and finally saw me, right? Now you found out who I'm, right? You deserve to become a cop, Porus. Take a look... Look at me well. Even now are you telling me to leave, dad? Advising you to leave everything all these days... is a big mistake which I realize only now. If you leave them like this... How many more families will they ruin like they did our family? Porus, I'm not bothered whether you become a cop or not. But today all of them should die in this place. I'll watch standing here. Go and hit them. Go, go and hit them. Hey, come on... You penetrated into my head and made me restless, didn't you? Come on... Are you dare enough to stand in front of me? Can vagabonds like you dare to confront with me? You wandered around to see this face, isn't it? You've seen now, right? This is the end for people like you. What you said is right. You people stay great until we the common people tolerate everything But if we start hitting you back... You killed my sister brutally. Still how many girls lives are you going to ruin? Hey! Hey, leave me. Get up. If anything happens to my brother... I'll not spare you. If it's your brother, you agonize, isn't it? How'd I have felt tormented when you killed my sister? Boss! Hey! Ela! Brother! Ela! Don't spare him. Ela... Brother! How can you become a cop after killing so many people? Your life is over. Tell me, brother. Selvam brother! If you get a chance to revenge on those who killed your brother Guna... Would you take advantage of it? Definitely I'll take advantage, brother. Then you come to the place where I say. Brother, I have done lot of sinful deeds. Let me clean all of these and seek little bliss. You go ahead to become a cop. There would be no trace of such an incident. Sir, it has been three months since my son went missing. What action have you taken so far? The family of a cop itself has no security here. Mr. Kathamuthu, don't forget that you're talking to a higher officer. No one here is ideal. Not only your son went missing. A man of great status in the society has gone missing. Totally sixteen people are missing. Till now we haven't got even a small clue. We don't even know whether they are alive or dead. Had they been dead, how it's possible to dispose all the corpses? There is a master mind behind this. Now where is he! What is he doing? No clue at all. But I'll find him. I'll find him. May I come in, sir? - Come in. Sir! My certificates, sir. Porus, what does it mean? Porus alias Purusothaman, sir. When Alexander invaded India, He gathered a huge elephant army and awestruck Alexander. It's the name of a great King! Interesting! Let's get ready to face the war then. Yes, sir. Meet our SP, Mr. Kathamuthu. I know, sir. I saw in the news that his son went missing three months ago. You seem to be well informed, young man. Yes, by the way your appointment order.. Yeah, here you go. Porus, Congratulations! Thank you, sir. - You're welcome. Everything has gone. If I had not withdrawn the case... Would my daughter had this stance? I'm not strong enough, I have become old. Had I been strong enough... I would've butchered the guys and fed them to crocodiles mixed with the meat. I would've fed... Give it. Let's give to his mother and leave. No, Mythili. It'll be a help as long as they aren't aware. It'll become a publicity if they knew that we did it. We don't want that. Come, let's go. Who is this? Who gave this, grandpa? Your father will often tell a story that to resolve all this, a lion will co That lion has come now.
