Dev! Zafar! Extracted By ViSHAL I know I am dying. How much time do I have? You have enough time, Satya... For you to not lose hope. Hope only makes you wait... It doesn't change reality. How much time do I have? One year... Two, maybe... My child... It is not possible for you to travel in this condition. Will I get better sitting at home? My child, some things are not in our control. A dying person should fix their karma... Not their health. That is in my control. If I don't do this while I am alive I'll regret it even after I am dead. I will have to do this for my husband. Satya! Went here at times. Went there at times. An uproar she created. Whichever way she went. Leaving these acquainted lanes. Who is this dear one she's going to? Deprived my soul feels. Though it's raining colours. Deprived my soul feels. Though it's raining colours. I'm the looter of comfort. Stealer of sleep. Bring me. Bring me. The royal scarf. Bring me. The royal scarf. I tie anklets on my feet. On my feet. They echo pleasantly when I walk. And the breeze tells me. Come have a ride with me. When I dance. The world wonders. When I dance. The world wonders. How come in the city. There is a wild peahen? Bring me. The royal scarf. Catch the last kite, Roop didi. Make us win! My scarf is red. Catch it before it flies. Just couldn't catch that kite... You go inside. You have come back again! Roop! Father, you won't be able to say it. I beg of you, please leave. I beg of you, please hear me out one last time Roop. Look, Satya ji... When your father had helped us with his generosity... We didn't know that one day his daughter. Would return to collect his kindness as debt with interest. I haven't come to collect interest, Roop... I've come to ask you for a favour. I'm sorry. I can't do this favour for you. My freedom is not for sale. You are getting me wrong, Roop. Or perhaps I'm the only one who is getting it right. All I am asking for is a year of your life, Roop... Because I have only a year to live. Think calmly about it once, my child. All she wants is... That you live with her and the family for a year. What's the harm in that? Once I go, I won't be able to return, father. Satya is a good woman. She has promised me that... She will look after your sisters till they get married. Is this why you raised me with an education? So that you could sell me at a fair price one day? Roop! What kind of father sends his daughter alone to Husnabad and... Forces her to live in a stranger's house with no relation to them? Even if I go door to door to teach music all my life... I'll never be able to get you and your sisters married! As the eldest sister, this is your duty. I'm not forcing you, my child. I know Satya since her childhood. She will take better care of you than us. The choice is yours. Wait! I'll come with you. But I have one condition. Your husband will have to marry me first. I'll enter that house only as your husband's wife... Not as his mistress. Roop, all that I want is that while I am alive... You get to know him, understand him so - - So that after you die, he should marry me? What kind of a wife are you? And if for a moment I agree to your madness. Who will guarantee that after your death. Your husband will marry me? What if he throws me out of the house? Where will I go then? What will happen to me? Who'll accept me after that? Have you thought about it? - Roop, I promise you... - Promise?! When you won't be alive who will fulfil your promise? Without getting married I will not step into that house. The sharp words that I speak. Are like. Bullets coming out of a gun. My manners blend together like rangoli. Just like. Eid on the day of Holi. The sharp words that I speak. Are like. Bullets coming out of a gun. My manners blend together like rangoli. Just like. Eid on the day of Holi. My life is such. Sometimes I crave the journey. Sometimes the destination. Rest all is first class. Rest all is first class. Rest all is first class I swear. Rest all is first class. In a moment I weigh the pros In a moment I weigh the cons. Roll the dice as per the rules of the game. That's my way of dealing with life. Who needs riches? You lose as much as you make I'm a merchant in the trade of love. Some mornings bring a smile to my face. Some evenings are melancholic. Rest all is first class. Rest all is first class. Rest all is first class I swear. Rest all is first class. You're the talk of the town. Pamphlets are distributed in your name. There are a million Romeos. But you're in a different league. My praises and criticisms dodge each other. Like in a game of hide and seek. My manners blend together like rangoli. Just like. Eid on the day of Holi. My life is such. Sometimes I crave the journey. Sometimes the destination. Rest all is first class. I swear. Rest all is first class. Two more girls have come to learn singing at Madame Bahaar's haveli. Don't try to flirt with them. Do you know? All the Hindu girls are talking of moving to Amritsar. Why don't you talk to Abdul once? He's quite upset. That Dev Chaudhry has just come from London... And printed an article against Partition. He got married again today. Brought his second wife home... And people tarnish the image of Muslims. Dev Chaudhry? Yes, my love, Dev Chaudhry. His wife is dying... And it's her last wish that Dev get married again. What happened, Zafar? Come home O'stranger. Come visit, my dear! Come home O'stranger. You are welcome, my dear! I love my wife very much. I don't know how Satya convinced you for this marriage... But, I've done this only for her happiness. Don't misunderstand me... You will get the dignity you deserve in this house. This relation will have respect but not love. The lesser you expect from me, the lesser your hardship will be. I hope your heart is is bigger than mine... And with time you'll find it in you to forgive me. My husband bid me farewell on our wedding night. Because you married a man you had never met before. In fact, for days I didn't even know what he looked like. My one decision made in rage... Destroyed all four of our lives. By the way, Zafar miyaan... If you love your swords so much... Why don't you join the fight of the blacksmiths? I'm making swords for that fight. Your witty lines charm the hearts of ladies in Hira Mandi. Why didn't you come to the meeting yesterday? Was waiting to charm one more heart. Didn't want to break it. Look, Zafar miyaan... If these steel manufacturing machines come... All our workshops will shut. This time it is not an attack on our community. But on our livelihood. On one hand you say, Allah will look after us. And on the other, you get scared. If we work hard, we'll never be unemployed. As for your Awaam-e-Haqparty meeting and talk of Partition... I'm an illegitimate child. My own father did not give me his name. A man who didn't fight for his own rights. How will he fight for the community? Fine. Let it be. I've told you many times, Abdul miyaan. If you truly want to spread your message to the people... Then there is no better way than Balraj Chaudhry's newspaper. As you'd suggested, we went to meet The Daily Times people. But, ever since Balraj Chaudhry's son has come back from Britain... He's against Partition... And he's busy publishing articles on "One Nation One Identity". Revolution needs blood and sacrifice. Not through dialogues. You're right! Zafar miyaan, you're absolutely right! Come on... Hop on to our side! Don't get me wrong. You're like my brother. I can give my life... But only for you. Keep me away from the Chaudhry's affairs, Abdul miyaan. Dev, you'll have to be a little careful. This 'One Nation, One Identity' article... Is not going down well with people. The British are dividing our nation in the name of religion. It is not going to benefit anyone in the future. But without them we are incapable of governing our country. Why don't you write about that? We'll learn everything with time... Only if we remain united. Who has made you the Messiah of this cause? I'm just a voice with the power to reach people. Or rather power to instigate! Or I'm showing them the right way... Which you also believe in... But you're scared of politics. Do not forget that we are a minority here. And the Muslim League is getting stronger every day. You need to think with your head, not your heart. If only I were able to do so... Sometimes it's necessary for the head to lose to the heart. What happened Saroj? Where is Roop? She's not willing to come down. I'm leaving. It's fine. Send the breakfast to her room. Sure. Dev will always feel that... I have been unfair with him. But what you have done is right. Have some faith in life... The knots it has tangled... It will itself untangle. Where is this voice coming from? From Bahaar Begum's haveli. At one time she was the most famous courtesan of Husnabad. But she stopped dancing. Now she teaches singing. Where is Bahaar Begum's haveli? In Hira Mandi. The most disreputable area of the city. Saying the name ruins one's reputation. I'm telling you, Munshi sa'ab... There's no better blacksmith than Zafar bhai in Hira Mandi. Last year he made the swords for the British Army. Isn't he that illegitimate child... Zafar? How do his roots matter? You look at the quality of his work. It matters to me, Abdul sahab. Firstly, he's illegitimate... And on top of that... Pardon me... Muslim. Munshi ji... If he runs away with my money... I'll strangle your neck... Learn to respect people's work... Not their father's name... But this big thought... Your narrow mind won't understand. Leave me, Zafar! Leave me, Zafar... I'm telling you Zafar, leave him. Leave me Zafar... Zafar! Zafar! These people have no shame! Be grateful to us... We allow people like you to live in our area. As it is these people are in Hira Mandi because of our mercy... And what are they doing? They are increasing the filth! Roop! How long will you lock yourself in your room? You are married now. You also have some responsibilities in this house. Towards whom? Your husband? Who loves only you? We've not even seen each other. I only had one responsibility... Towards my sisters. And, I fulfilled that by getting married. Start working at Dev's newspaper. Spend some time with him. See, things will change. I've already spoken about it. You take such good care of everyone. I'm not your enemy, Roop. All I'm trying is to make your life easy before I am gone. You know... My parents thought that educating a girl child is a waste. If I were educated... I wouldn't let such a big opportunity go waste. I want to restart my vocal practise. Of course, you must. If you want... I can arrange a tutor right away. No! I want to go to Hira Mandi and learn from Bahaar Begum. You've learn't about the city quite fast... But you don't know the rules of this house... You can learn music but you cannot go to Hira Mandi. If you don't let me go to Hira Mandi... Then I won't work for the newspaper either. Then don't! Cage yourself in your anger. But remember... You wrote your own destiny... With your own will. Now this is your life, Roop. The sooner you realize this... Easier the rest of your life will be. You don't have any right over my life. Do you? Absolutely not! Baba, I know Roop. Once she makes up her mind... She doesn't listen to anyone. She's a daughter-in-law of this house. And like everyone else... She has to respect the rules of the house. As per your wish... We never even looked at that place. But we can't expect the same from Roop. Before she takes any drastic step... We should allow her to go. It's the only chance to bring Dev and Roop closer. Roop! What are you doing? Roop! Yes. Bhabhi ji is calling you. Between my stubbornness and their rules... My stubbornness won. Dev Chaudhry's talk of "One Nation One identity" sounds pleasant. But think again... On one side he's against Partition... And on the other side... He's trying to bring in steel factories... So from both sides we die hungry. We need more advertisements. Or else we'll be able to print only thrice a week. Sir, the whiskey ad we carried last week... They want to run an ad this week too. Because of that alcohol ad... The whole week... The Muslim sector boycotted our newspaper. The whiskey company is giving a hefty amount. Ahmed is right. We need to find other products. Cosmetics and sari. No one is offended by kohl and clothes. Instead of alcohol... We can advertise Lux soap in the paper... These ads will also make women buy the newspaper. I'm sorry... The thought came, so I blurted it out. I'm here to meet Dev Chaudhry. And, you are? Roop. His wife. Anant ji. Yes. Please, show her to her desk. Sure. Myself Anant Pal. Namaste! By the way, who is he? Please, come. What is this? Husband and wife don't even know each other. Maybe they had a Muslim wedding. That day if even you were on the other side of the veil... Dev sir would not have known. Hira Mandi's biggest festival... Dussehra. But this area is... The infamous part of the city. In accordance with traditions of the king of dynasties. You may lose your life but your promises must be kept. Hail the king of dynasties, The king of Ayodhya. Hail! Lord Ram. Hail! Beloved of queen Sita. Hail the king of dynasties, The king of Ayodhya. Hail! Lord Ram. Hail! Beloved of queen Sita. O'Ram! You are eagerly awaited. O'Ram! You are eagerly awaited. For more than seven lives by Sita! Come back home, O'stranger. Come visit, O'dear. Come back home, O'stranger. Come visit, O'dear. The king of birds Jatayu is here. He flutters his wings to save Sita. In the name of Ram. Hail Lord Ram. I lost my senses and my peace I lost my senses and my peace. But found my dearest gem, Ram. Come back home, O'stranger. Come visit, O'dear. Come back home, O'stranger. Come visit, O'dear. Neither my mother's lullaby. Nor the colours of spring. Nothing interests me anymore. Since my eyes rested on. The regal archer. Since then the angst of separation agonizes me. Neither my mother's lullaby. Nor the colours of spring. Nothing interests me anymore. Since my eyes rested on. The regal archer. Since then the angst of separation agonizes me. The whole world is aware of my dilemma. Alas! Ignorant is the callous one. Come back home, O'stranger. Come visit, O'dear. Went to the riverbank to fetch water. Delirious in love. Went to the riverbank to fetch water. Went to the riverbank to fetch water. Delirious in love. Went to the riverbank to fetch water. The charm of your eyes stunned me. Like a deer struck by an arrow. And I became your devotee. Come back home, O'stranger. Come visit, O'dear. The voice is good... But it lacks that sparkle... And to bring that sparkle in your raag... You must live a colourful life. But too much sparkle can make life bitter. I've come to learn music from you. Here, we call music... singing. Whatever the price to learn singing is... I accept it. My talent is so precious... It's priceless. Are you married? My experience says... Those who circle the fire of marriage... Their fire of passion dims forever. I'm here to reignite that fire. Please don't send me back without hope. Roop... It's getting late, we should leave. Aren't you the caretaker at the Chaudhry's? Yes. Does your family know that you've come to meet me? Yes, they know. Come tomorrow. I'll listen to your voice again. And if I like it again... Then I'll definitely teach you. For now I'm tired of this tête-à-tête. Khuda Hafiz. Hail the king of dynasties, The king of Ayodhya. Hail! Lord Ram. Hail! Beloved of queen Sita. Hail the king of dynasties, The king of Ayodhya. Hail! Lord Ram. Hail! Beloved of queen Sita. That glance held such light. My soul is shimmering. Trapped by enchantment. A maiden walks unstably. Pulling the strings of my heart. These whimsical imaginations of love I've heard all the courtesans of this market sing. Your voice has more love than pain. How? The further you go from me, the closer you'll find me. Don't shield your alluring eyes with disapproving eyelashes. Zafar. Come back home, O'stranger. Come visit, O'dear. Come back home, O'stranger. Come visit, O'dear. After ages I've heard such a voice... That has pain and solace. I'm grateful you reconsidered your decision. This is merely a compliment. Gratitude should be for criticism... Because it gives you the real teachings in life. Shall we leave? Tell me? I wanted to talk to you in office... But didn't get a chance. Regarding what? I don't want to just while my time in your company. I also want to work. I want to write an article. On which topic? On Hira Mandi. When I look at people from that area... It feels like there are stories hidden in every house. If you find a story worth reading... Then we'll print it. I know we're both trapped in this relationship. And I take equal blame for this. I just want to tell you... I don't have any expectations from this relationship. This is not a marriage but a compromise... And you can free yourself from it. I've never spoken about breaking this marriage. But I'm glad to know your opinion. Thank you. Excuse me... Where can I find Abdul Khan? Zafar bhai... Where's Abdul miyaan? She is here to meet him. Please go in. Just one encounter made you come back? Come... I'll fulfil your desire today. But you won't be able to satisfy me... I'll end up wasting my time. I'm married. So? I wasn't going to marry you. I am here to meet Abdul Khan. Why? Why do I need to tell you? Then why should I tell you where Abdul is? I want to write an article... On Hira Mandi and its people. That's why- - That's why you came to the brothel? Is this the way to talk? Calling a courtesan Taj Mahal will not change her fate! Do you look at all women the same way? This is my way. But you can change it for me. I have no such desire. How will you have? You're imprisoned in your marriage. But if you really want... I can fulfil your unfulfilled desires. You are too ill mannered. Thank you. Abdul? Thank you. Yes? Actually, I'm from Daily Times. I want to write an article on Hira Mandi... Its people, and social milieu... Daily Times. Yes. The social milieu is charged here... Blacksmiths are jobless. And this fight for our rights will lead to Partition. Will your newspaper write about it? No, right? Khuda Hafiz! What do you want? Don't answer that! Just want to ask... Is your work done? What happened to you suddenly? No, Abdul miyaan has a quick temperament. All day he's busy with the politics of Partition. But I don't care. As long as our locality is ours, it's all good. Thank God, at least you respect your locality. It's difficult to trust me. I know that. And why are you so attached to this place? Beautiful girls live here? Beautiful and... Easy too. Destiny threw me here. Life was about to crush me... But this street saved me. Taught me to walk. I triumphed... And that's how I got my name Zafar. Now, this is my home. Without these alleys, I'd have no identity. No one knows Hira Mandi better than me. So... Roop. (FACE) You've got a nice one, Masha Allah! Are you here to find a story or to hide yours? To find. Are you happy in your marriage? You said you're married. But you didn't say you're happy. Do you have any limit? Limits are meant for borders... Not for thoughts. And if you have a question, it's better to ask. Half the world's gone mad cooking up stories. So, away from political issues. This place has some amazing things... If you want to see them... I'd like to see. Do you have the courage to step into my world? I've got nothing to lose. And, anyway... I'm sure your world is better than you. All right. We'll meet next Friday. Kalaam Valley. Don't worry... Without consent or a good price... I don't touch womens. If Zafar bhai manages to sit on the bull for 7 seconds... Then he will win. Zafar! Well done! One. Three. Six. Seven. Are you crazy?! You've gone from distant to intimate quite fast. Why did you call me here? You were looking for a story. I showed you a glimpse. Got scared? Why? You could've died. Death is my right. And an illegitimate child like me has no aim... Nor anything to lose, unlike you. That's why I'm not scared of death. The day you fall in love... You'll find an aim... And you'll start fearing death too. Pity! Your wish may never get fulfilled. I love this game. I have never seen a specimen like you. There is no one like me! Isn't she that journalist girl? At least leave her. Some day I will. She's a good girl. Too good. That's why I don't have any bad thoughts about her. I've heard she's married? I hope you know what you're doing. The more I was getting estranged from the family... The closer I was getting to Zafar. For the world, Zafar was a riddle... In trying to untangle him, I was getting entangled. He came like a storm in my life. And I, like hope, floated away with him. Did you know Lahore city used to be known as Lohawar... Which means the city of blacksmiths. Blacksmiths are the face of this city. The British want to bring machinery here... That'll make us all jobless... I don't understand... That your newspaper... We will flow in the wind. We will nest in the clouds. You are my rain, I'm your cloud. If I cannot be yours. Then I cannot be someone else's. You are my lover I'm your mad lover. Among thousands one gets. Such a destiny. Just like Ranjha and Heer. Don't know why this society. Is adamant on erasing. Love is not a blemish. Love is a kohl, my dear. Love is not a blemish. Love is a kohl, my dear. Dear. O' dear. In the eyes of the world. It's a disorder. Only the ones who get it know it's a devotion. These dramas help to attract more audience. It benefits the theatre also. You are not involved in this drama? I'm involved in your life's drama. Is that enough? One sided perhaps. It could be heart's illusion. On both sides, it is a coincidence. When life brings. Its story at a turn. We feel like strangers. By mere eye contact with someone. Whatever I retained. On my beloved I offered. I need not a hold of. Anyone else's hand, o dear. Something's changed. Not really. Not in your voice, in your heart. I'm yours. I'm the darkness, you are my golden light I'm yours I'm a lost traveler you are my destination I'm yours. You are the firefly I'm a dense jungle I'm yours. I'm yours. This isn't worth printing. The blacksmiths of Hira Mandi came to meet me today. I think you should hear them out... Otherwise, they'll force our Muslim staff to go on a strike. Baba, please come straight to the point? Roop. Have courtesans started visiting homes to dance? I'm sorry, you've come to the wrong address. Spare Roop, Zafar. Till when are you going to run away from the truth? Till the truth is alive. I've learnt this from you. Why are you so worried about Roop? In all this, Roop is not at fault. In all this, it wasn't my mistake either. If you want to learn, then be a man and learn from your mistakes. Don't hold others responsible for your life. That's the problem, Baba. I don't want to learn anything from a man like you. You're using Abdul... To provoke people against their Press. Organizing protests. And I'm not saying anything to you... But Roop... Why is she being punished for the sins of others... Not others... She's being punished for your sins, Ammi. You fell in love with a married man... Had a child and abandoned him on the streets. Don't say that. I was just seventeen... I was deeply in love with him... And I'm still not free from it. It was a mistake... That I still haven't been able to correct. Mistakes made consciously are not mistakes but dishonesty. And till date you haven't made the effort to admit it. My love had turned me selfish. I kept the child... So that I could grow closer to Balraj... But he grew further away from me. I thought he's running away because of the shame of a child. If I leave you, he'll come back... But then I understood... That it's not you... He's running away from me. I'd come back to take you... But you didn't want to... Discarded things often decay Ammi. Our relationship has also decayed forever. I have no reason to come back to you besides your funeral. Dev... I just want to say one thing. I also got married without my consent. That's why I searched for love outside this house. I hope the same doesn't happen to Roop. Try to commit to your relationship. Not everyone thinks like you Baba. At least, I respect Roop. You never respected mother... And all her life she lived thinking that it's her fault. She was even ready to accept your illegitimate child. I don't know from where she drew her courage. If only you'd agreed... Our family could have been saved from falling apart. But your arrogance was bigger than your mistakes. It's not that boy's fault. But now if I meet him I'll hate you even more. You have destroyed our family... But the reason is him. So, it's better you don't advise me on how to handle my relationships. Balraj Chaudhry... Gave my share of wealth, respect and dignity to his legitimate son. So, in return I'll snatch his daughter-in-law away. And I've got nothing to lose. I have no legitimate existence, no family... They can't be trusted... No one wants them... I've grown up hearing these taunts. But enough of it. The girl he brought home to continue his lineage... I'll use her to destroy the family. What will happen then? By doing all this... Will you get your father... Your childhood, your respect... Your rights back? Wipe off this hatred from your eyes... Only then you'll be able to see that girl's love. The desire for revenge has made you blind. In the angst to destroy your father... You are destroying yourself. I accept it all. I'll destroy everything. He won't even know... How he got destroyed. The man who refused my existence... He himself will come begging for mercy. And then... I'll set his hopes on fire... That even hell's fires will pale. He'll have to pay for his sins. And in return, if my fate is cursed... I'll accept it with open arms... Ammi. Ya Allah! Everyone In Hira Mandi knew Zafar... But who he really was... No one knew. Don't you feel like going back? There's no reason to go back. For generations we're in this profession. Our children are raised on this livelihood! If the British bring their steel machines... Blacksmiths will be jobless! Today it's us. Tomorrow, it can happen to any other artisan! As you'd advised... I called workers of the Daily Times. Do you think this will reach the Chaudhry's? And they'll support us? His animosity towardsAwaam-e-Haq is pretty old. People like Balraj Chaudhry... Sometimes make their religion their agenda. You're right. If he can fight for his religion... Then why can't we? This fight isn't about justice. It's about our rights! And now your people are ready... To grab their long forgotten rights. Is Satya Chaudhry going to die? She is going to pass away... Because she has cancer. And, what'll happen after she's dead? You'll sit on her throne? You husband will give you the respect of the first wife? Your marriage will flourish? Bo-kata! (THE KITE IS CUT!) I used to love the kite flying festival. Then, what happened? A flying kite used to fill me with hope. Now, I only see fallen kites. People here love their kites... ZBut more than flying their own kite... They enjoy cutting others. Do you only look for faults? Yes... If only you'd lived my life... You'd know why there's so much darkness around me. Ordeals are a part of everyone's lives... But being bitter will poison our lives and decay it. When someone else's failure feels like our victory... Then we are the greatest failures in the world. Have you ever been in love? I race with the kites... But I don't let them cut me loose. We should leave... Or else, the night will engulf us. You were right. Something has changed in me... Because of Zafar. I think I'm- - You are married! It isn't a marriage, it's a contract. It's a mistake to think... But to act on it is a sin! I haven't told anyone except you. I thought you'd understand. Just because I run a kotha... Doesn't mean you ask for my permission to cheat. I wasn't trying to insult you. Your husband is a nice man. Is being nice enough? To spend the rest of your life with? I need some time to think over this. What's there to think? If the steel industry comes... All the blacksmiths will be jobless. Isn't this news worth printing? But industries are good for the country. And all of you can work in the factories. We will not be enslaved. The question is about the country's development... Not about slavery. Before, slavery for the British... And now for the Hindus. This is all that a Muslim will keep doing here! Don't try to change the issue. If we drag religion in every conversation... This country will burn forever! Muslim League has won the election. Now, don't you worry about the country... Worry just about yourself! I have the habit of worrying about everyone. And that's the difference between you and me. I don't use people's plight to mislead them. You are right. The issue is about religion. Once we create our own nation... Our voices won't go in vain. But then... Who'll listen to your voice, Dev sahab? She's Dev Chaudhry's second wife. Munshi ji wants to give you a contract. And what have you given him in return? Did he decide to just because you're a Hindu? I don't accept charity. I'm trying to help, not giving charity. And did I ask for your help? I am good as I stand. Why do you look for faults in everything? I am scared of goodness. It often wants something in return. I have taken your guarantee. I made Munshi ji understand... That Hira Mandi is your home. And I don't want anything in return. Do you like to read? A lot! You? A lot. Did you finish the Cabinet Mission article? No, something doesn't seem right. It could probably be our last article which- Which could further your ideology of "One Nation, One Identity". The price of freedom is Partition. The sooner we accept this the better. Those people will never understand your sentiments. I won't be able to hide. I won't be able to reveal. In your love I've become. Mad, O' dear. If I cannot be yours. Then I cannot be someone else's. I'm your lover I'm your mad lover. Have you seen her husband? No, and I don't want to either. The alleyways of love are slippery Zafar miyaan... Often lovers fall flat on their faces. Be careful. Don't know why this society. Let's go. Is adamant on erasing. Love is not a taint, it is a kohl, my dear. You should not support these steel industries in our paper. What has it got to do with our publication? The issue is not with the industries. This can propel the country forward. It can make the people your enemy! In the eyes of the world. It's a disorder. Only the ones who get it know it's a devotion. One sided perhaps. It could be heart's illusion. On both sides, it is but coincidence. The further you stay away from him, the better. A moth that romances a flame ultimately perishes in it. Among thousands one gets. Such a destiny. Just like Ranjha and Heer. Don't know why this society. Is adamant on erasing. It's not safe for you to be here. Please leave immediately. Long live the revolution! Long live the revolution! Jinnah has called for Direct Action. Due to which there could be riots. We might have to leave Husnabad. Satya is too weak. It is not advisable for her to travel. Why are you avoiding me? I got so busy in showing you the city... That I forgot the path of my life. I am leaving Husnabad. How strange this life is. At first, I didn't want to come here... And now, I don't want to leave. I am sure wherever your husband takes you... You will find happiness. I don't love him. Neither does he. How long will I live this lie? Some relationships are like debts... That cannot be redeemed, they have to be repaid. No one profits from what you are trying to do. Sometimes a loss is better than a profit. Emotion should not be a slave of customs. Do you know the biggest sin in the world? Is to suppress your feelings. I don't have any feelings for you, Roop. Why can't I believe you? Because you want love more than belief. You will be destroyed. I cannot give you anything more than grief. I accept it. You don't know me... Or my life... Or the reason... For which I was trying to get close to you. That reason is not love. There can be a thousand reasons to avoid love in the market of fear. But love needs only one in your heart. I have found my reason. The rest is up to you. You all should prepare to leave Husnabad soon. I will not go anywhere without you. I'm leaving without you. The doctor said that you could be cured soon. To look into the eyes of your lover and pass away... Few people are as fortunate. These tears are of peace... Let them flow. You are taking my peace along with you. Now what will I do with the rest of my life. Since a few days... I have been feeling jealous of Roop... A good kind of jealousy. She is going to get my share of happiness. No one can take your place. I want to give her my status. Promise me... That you will fulfil all our dreams with her. You will educate your daughters... You will be a friend to your sons... You will forgive your Baba. Don't leave me Satya. Please stay. Her absence affected us for months. So, did you leave Husnabad after her passing away? I wish we had left. Sir, Abdul's party has become quite powerful. Let's give this article a second thought. Eid Mubarak. You too. Does he know what he is going to do? Besides, the Awaam-e-Haqmembers are after our blood. After this article... The blacksmiths of this area will burn us alive. Khuda Hafiz. Are you grieving in the time of celebration? Who said I am grieving? People drink together during the festivities. Only in grief do people drink alone. I just want to steal a few moments from my life and spend it alone. I am tired of the pitiful eyes of people. Me too. So what is the reason for your grief? There is no liquor in your hands... Nor are you celebrating the festival. It is easy to reveal your secrets to strangers... Your heart feels lighter and your reputation remains intact. I have fallen in love... With a married woman... Would you like to drink? I am a Muslim. Eid Mubarak. Thank you. And she? Does she love you? More than I do. Then what's the problem? I wish you were her husband... The matter would be resolved here. Try to speak to her once. This world is strange. No one speaks to one another they all set out to fight. Sometimes fighting is easier than expressing one's love. What kind of a husband wants to live with a woman. Who loves another man? But there is one more aspect of this story. Great! I had come for a story and you have set a stage! The issue is that... I have told her only half the truth. Then tell her the whole truth. It is not that easy. Often it is that easy. Anyways, what's your story? I want to collect the broken pieces of my fate and move on. But I don't know where to begin. Find the first piece that wounded you... The rest will be easy to gather. So, how many women have you slept with? What kind of a ridiculous question is this? Means one. I was married at the age of 18. How many women have you slept with? I don't know how to count that many. Have you ever screamed in your life? Come... Let's scream aloud today and tell life... That we will not be defeated by its treachery. Come... I promise you will feel liberated. Try it. That's enough. Really? Just one woman in your whole life! With his crystal-like eyes. Hundred signals he gives. Under my window. The luckless fellow whistles all day. With his crystal-like eyes. Hundred signals he gives. Under my window. The luckless fellow whistles all day. In love he has become. Part blind, part deaf. My lover is an ordinary fellow. Satya had taken care of this house. I will not allow it to be destroyed. You have to understand your responsibilities in this house. I don't think I will be able to take Satya's place. Your husband has been staying out all night since many days. Take care of him. Some relationships are like debts... That cannot be redeemed, they have to be repaid. Dev and my relationship is somewhat like that. Next week we are leaving Husnabad. I am in love with this city. I will not be able to leave Husnabad. Angel like Iranian face. But such Indian mannerisms. In the lake-like depth of your eyes. There's a crusade of a thunder. Look, in your assembly we have arrived. To sacrifice our lives. For the sake of one beloved. Today you have two-two lovers. The engine of our hearts. Have halted at your station. The engine of our hearts. Have halted at your station. Why would you think of us as ordinary fellows? My lover is an ordinary fellow. Why would you think of us as ordinary fellows? The night has brought. Such a festive atmosphere. To let go of all our distresses. It's our turn. The night has brought. Such a festive atmosphere. To let go of all our distresses. It's our turn. Today, let us dance and sing. Let us indulge in romance. And let the heartbreakers be damned. Let the worldly duties be damned. A beauty glances in the mirror of my heart. A beauty glances in the mirror of my heart. In love he has become. Part blind, part deaf. My lover is. My lover is. My lover is an ordinary fellow. My lover is an ordinary fellow. Why would you think of us as ordinary fellows? Since when? Since going to learn music from Bahaar Begum. What is his name? Zafar! It is time's injustice. That I'm yours. You are someone's gift. But your love. Is my wealth. You are someone's inheritance. Your father is worrying about you. The day I die. Let's go. Come to meet me once. With the permission of someone else. Last year has been tough on you. I apologise if my behaviour has upset you. Either you can separate... Or give this marriage one more chance. I will accept your decision. Are the doors of your kotha always open? We don't have anything to hide. We are leaving this city. You bid me farewell ages ago. Do tell me... What pain have you come to inflict today? Time's changed but you haven't Bahaar jaan. Now you're using your son to destroy my family! Put some sense in him... Roop is my daughter-in-law. God's wit is also unmatchable! The man who has made... A spectacle of so many lives... Is here today with a plea to save his dignity... Time hasn't changed you either, Balraj sa'ab. I'd clearly told you that our relationship was wrong. But you couldn't face the truth... And you have spent your whole life making a spectacle of your betrayal. Oh, so that's how you've consoled yourself? If the relationship was so wrong... Then why did you come back again and again? You too were in love Balraj sa'ab... But you got scared of the society... And one day dumped me like filth. Your selfishness disgusts me. Please do me a favour and leave from here. Wow! What a blessing God has bestowed on me today. After years, I came to meet Ammi... And found Abba here too. On one side there's Bahaar Begum, who discarded me. And on the other side there's Balraj Chaudhry... Who was denying my existence till yesterday... And today, he's here to beg from me. What do you want? That I should beg you for the pride of my family? Leave them alone! But that's your legacy... To leave your dear ones. What do you know about family? Anyway, only God knows how many of my siblings are roaming around here. I have only one family... Which has to be saved from you two. Then tell your daughter-in-law to stop loving me. I'd told you to abort him! His birth murdered our relationship. Or revealed your truth! This is not our child... it's a result of my mistake... That I cannot break away from my whole life. Zafar, leave him. Zafar!! Do whatever you want with me... But don't make my son pay for my sins. He hasn't done anything to you. I'd met him today. He has everything... Except happiness. In your struggle to protect him from the world... You forgot to give him love. I had only one aim in my life... To see you in this condition. But Roop is right... When someone else's failure feels like victory to us... Then we are the greatest failures in the world. I know you'll never accept me. But you can't deny that I'm a part of you. From your son's share just give me Roop. I love her. I won't ask for anything else besides this. Stay away from Roop and Dev's marriage, Zafar... Or else the consequence will be dire! Roop's love is my right! And you don't own it... And this right, I'll take anyhow. Zafar... I know you don't agree with me in lots of things... But this time you also know... That I am right. Someone's come from Hira Mandi to meet you. What happened miyaan? It's all because of that woman. I can't believe that... The Chaudhry's can stoop so low to hurt you. Roop has no hand in this. Blinded love shuts the doors of the mind. You can't see the games Chaudhry is playing with you. But, I'm not blind. You can forgive her, if you want... But I'll take your revenge from that woman. If you touch her... Along with our relation, I'll chop your head off. Love... Often makes you commit mistakes... I'd warned you. You're getting me wrong. I'd sworn that... I'd never come here again. But today because of you... I had to break my vow. You don't know what I'm going through. Pity, it's only going to get worse. Zafar is Balraj and my son. He's used you... To destroy this house. He loves me. I've seen it in his eyes. He has lied to you from the beginning. He must've made some mistakes in his life. But, our love is true. You are educated... And sensible. He is a boy from Hira Mandi. In his life, no woman holds any value outside his bed. And he didn't even want that from you. All he wants... Is to publicly humiliate Balraj Chaudhry. And your blind love... Has given him that opportunity. This is the truth! Accept it! Even if you had left your husband and gone to him... He wouldn't accept you. You should love someone who respects you... And can love you more than you can. Roop, You aren't his love... You're his vengeance... And he loves only his vengeance. To win your family feud... You entangled me in a political turmoil for all these years. Everyone is right... That people like you have no integrity! With the fire you ignited... I'll use the same fire to burn this city down. Even you won't be able to stop what you started. It was necessary. Zafar has always hated me. He'll hate me a little more. But at least he'll be safe. What's the use of this life... If you've snatched away the only purpose to live? Illegitimate love always leads to destruction. His name is Zafar. Your brother. You'd met him on the night of Eid. I didn't have the courage to admit my mistakes. Please forgive me. If I never remembered you in prayers I have never cursed you too. Neither have I been displeased. Nor have I been disloyal. Why have you become unfaithful. Why did you get upset? After separation from you. I have become devastated. I have become devastated. I have become devastated. My eyes seek you. Come to light them up. Come for the sake of farewell. Come back one last time. My eyes seek you. Come to light them up. Come for the sake of farewell. Come back one last time. You have become dear to a stranger. Why did you get upset? After separation from you. I have become devastated. I have become devastated. You left the decision to me. I have become devastated. In prayer I asked for your long life. I used to repent from myself. May you always be warded off from my own eyes. In prayer I asked for your long life. I used to repent from myself. May you always be warded off from my own eyes. But how did I become so unpleasant to you? After separation from you I have become devastated I have become devastated. I have become devastated. I have become devastated. Zafar... Zafar. Zafar. Zafar. No. What to say in love I'm tongue-tied. After separation from you I have become devastated. I have become devastated I'd fallen in love with someone from Hira Mandi. You have always told me the truth. Now... When we are trying to commit to this marriage... I want to tell you my truth. This relationship will have respect but not love. I hope your heart is bigger than mine... And in time you find it in you to forgive me. You used to love someone? What changed? I don't respect him. And the love just ended? You said that you want to commit to this relationship. Why now? Just sleeping together is not enough. There are many other facets to maintain a marriage. I always told Satya... The result of a forced relationship is never good. To make her happy, I sacrificed mine. And maybe it killed your happiness too. For which I was ashamed... But with time that shame has slowly changed into affection. You have your whole life in front of you, Roop. Decisions made in anger usually lead to mistakes. Tell the truth to yourself once. This much respect you can give me and our relationship. The relationship between husband-wife should not be bound by tradition... But only with love. Dev Chaudhry has taken his decision against us. I've made my decision too. To destroy these Chaudhrys. Think about it. Anyone who's not with us is now our enemy! Saroj ji! Saroj ji! We will bring the revolution! We will make our nation! Raise your hand, rise in solidarity! We will bring the revolution! Raise your hand, rise in solidarity! We will bring the revolution! We will make our nation! Please forgive me. That's all? You've come to say that? What difference does it make? You've already made up your mind... Haven't you? I loved you with passion. In return, you couldn't even be honest. Was it so difficult to tell me the truth? All my life I'd filled my heart with only one thing. Hatred. I betrayed everyone... So that I could seek revenge from my father. You threw the hatred out of me... And filled my heart with love. You were changing my heart. I got scared. I got scared of your love. Everything that I wanted from this house... You gave to me. If I'd told you the truth... I'd have lost you. Did you get me with your lies? We are not meant to be together, Roop. This is God's will. Didn't you ever love me? If I have to answer that... Then questions will be raised about your love. Why don't you ever give a straight answer, Zafar? Just once tell me. Just once... That you love me. Let's go from the back exit. Kill all three of them. We can't shelter them here. They're hunting for Hindus in Muslim households... They won't be safe here. Take them to the station. Come with us... I can't abandon my Hindu girls and leave... Please come with us, Ammi! Where I was born, maybe... There my death will come. Please, leave... Please, leave... Dev! You both get in the train. I'll stop them. They'll kill you. They are my people. They won't do anything to me. Leave them, Abdul miyaan! Let them go... For my sake. Zafar! Zafar! Zafar come with us! Zafar! Run! Fast! Zafar... Zafar! Get up... Zafar... Zafar... Come with us. Zafar get up... Run, Zafar... I don't know if I was buried or burnt... But my illegitimate life achieved a purpose. And that love will always remain alive. Creating borders does not make the world big or small. It only breaks thousands of lives apart. Often in those scattered lives the pain of broken hearts unites two people. The story of the Daily Times owners... Roop and Dev is one of those thousand tales of Partition... That will get lost in the wails of history. Love and hate... Both are red in colour. But the difference between the two is... Hatred destroys the world... And in love... You have to destroy yourself. And yet, love gets tainted. Our tainted love will never perish... It will always remain within us. Now the decision is up to you. What did you feel in this story? Destruction or love? Extracted By ViSHAL
