Rando licked it clean. Oh, that's funny. Come, kids. Let's go inside. Hey! No one's working here? Coming! You need something? Where's the food? Did you order it or not? I did already. Then where is it? Huh? Where? I'm starving here! Just wait a minute. I'll call and tell them to hurry. That little rascal! Ow! That hurts! Are you trying to peel my scalp off? Oh! Hello! It's the president! - You seem busy. - No, sir! - Should I come later? - Have a seat. - Welcome, sir. - Hi. We'll get ready. Wait. Yes, sit. We'll be in the office, sir. Okay. - Ugh - Just a shave? Is there something else you can do? Oh, stop. Great, great. Do whatever Miss Yu wants to do. When I'm tired, there's nothing like your touch. Could you please make sure I get a good spot, sir? What are you talking about? I mean the multi-center at the junction. Why don't you ask the building owner for that? I heard you already acquired exclusive rights, sir. That's nonsense. Sir, I really mean it. You will be compensated generously. Let's see what I can do. Thank you, sir. Miss Yu! Jeez! What are you doing? Get off! Good job. Good-bye, ma'am. Beauty Salon I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Come here. Hey! Ow! Chasing after Jinok wo, won't feed you. Hey! Don't wear out your sister-in-law's name, huh? Where, where did you get that lighter? A guy like me deserves a lighter like this. Did you steal it from a customer? Here's my take on ownership: Finders, keepers. Look! That old dude's here again. He's gonna make trouble. How am I supposed to figure you out? What have I done wrong? Why are you so upset? I can't read your mind! Talk to me! Dammit! Ah, to hell with you. Hey, Myunghee! Why the hell are you doing this? Did you call me Myunghee? Am I your friend? How dare you call me by my name? Hey! Who're you calling hey? How dare you talk to me like that? Ok, I don't know why you're so angry, but I need to talk to you. - There's nothing wrong with fighting. - How dare you behave like that around my friends? Did you have to embarrass me? You call them your friends? Such assholes. - What? - I'm busy, too... Don't be like this, huh? Hey, hey, look here! I have things to do, too. Get out of the way! What do you want? The food--Er, she ruined it. Ok, if you're gonna be like that, I'll do it my way. Huh! You think I care? Okay! - We'll see who's laughing in the end! - Is anyone gonna pay for this food? You're pathetic. You pitiful, pitiful man. I slept with you once, and look how proud and cocky that made you. What a loser. What did you say? Somebody pay for this. Hey, asshole! I wasn't talking to you. Don't cuss at me! Are you trying to piss me off? Son of a bitch! Why're you hitting me? Shut up! Don't bother with that prick. Damn you all. Do you have change for 100,000 won? Where is it? Huh? Where do you work? At, at the Donghwaru across from the ma, market. Okay! I'll send the money later. What the heck just happened? Sixty-three, fifteen, and seven... The total is eighty-five hundred won! You think money grows on trees? I'm taking this out of your pay. Idiot. Finished counting yet? It's almost done. Do it in the room. Come. And you! I'll forgive you this time. Never make another mistake on a delivery. Crazy world. Country bumpkin! Don't use the smelly Joseon soy sauce there! Damn you arrogant Seoul bastard. Joseon soy sauce is the best for seasoning food. I see, here's another sucker from the country here. Hey, did you grill frog legs when you were young? - I do... It was delicious. - Yes! - It tasted just like chicken. - Sure! These guys are making me sick again. And what about the grasshoppers? Fried? That was good, too. You guys... Such a country bumpkin He's beyond help. The way I see it, Chunsik is not a total Seoul person. Among 8 million people in Seoul, Real Seoulites can't be more than 80,000. I was born and raised here myself, But this area wasn't Seoul, back then. So, where were you born, Chunsik? I don't know. I was an orphan, without any family. How should I know where I was born? But I grew up in Seoul, anyway. This is just like the vibe in your novel. Mr. Choi. You're interested in the social structure of the lower class, right? Huh, then you really are a Seoulite. Oh, that's nice. - Hey! - Huh? Don't you guys wanna see that tonight? See... What? You, dork. Don't act naive. The thing you saw last time. You don't really remember that? You've got those kind of guests at your motel, ag, again? Hey, when did I ever lie to you? Wh, When did they check in? Man, why the hell do you have to know that? Hey man, the thing is, It's no good if it's going to be like the last time. Right, you mean if they just fall asleep, There's gonna be nothing to see, right? Ok, if you're not interested! Hey, Gilnam! I'm coming! You know. You think big mouths are good on girls, huh? That's useless. Lips are the real thing. You want full lips on girls. That's the real thing. Hey! Mr. Shampoo! Miss Yu, the girl at the barber shop. She's something, right? I think that bitch is trying to flirt with me a little, huh? Watch your mouth, you little shit How dare you talk about her that way? What? What the hell's the matter with you? Glaring at me with those crazy eyes. Little farmer boy from the boondocks gets a taste of indoor plumbing And now he knows no fear! Hey! Did you see that, Deokbae? This kid's getting cocky. You take that back! And what if I don't? What are you gonna do about it? You, country bumpkin, you want a piece of me? What are you guys doing? Don't fight. You were joking, right? How's that a joke? Why would you joke about that? Asshole. You, dumb ass! Miss Yu isn't even your girlfriend. Dream on, loser! If you think she's naive, you'll get screwed, you idiot! She's a slut! Douchebag! Asshole! - You're not seriously fighting, are you? - This shit-headed asshole! Come on, country bumpkin! Stop it, you guys! Screw you, asshole! - Fucker! - The fuck do you want! I didn't like that asshole from the beginning. That asshole is younger than me. Always calling me country bumpkin! Always getting on my nerves like that! You're younger than me, too, and you're scolding Gilnam, no... You bla, blame Chunsik? Right? You bastards! Give me my land! How could you build houses on my land without my permission? This land is where I used to plow, It's my farm! My land! Bastards! Give me back my land! Sir. Sir, why are you doing this again? They're gonna take you away again. They can call you crazy. They can frame you as a nut case and have you taken to the nut house. I'm not going! I'm not crazy! Yes, I know that. What're you doing? Someone might see us. So what? There's nothing wrong about a young man and a woman talking in the middle of the day. Who's gonna stop us? Right? You're so shameless. "Shameless" is my motto. Anyway, I'm not here to argue with you. The thing is, Didn't I tell you before? About my plan to build a hotel? That's ridiculous! You called me here this early to talk about that nonsense? It's not a joke. I've already got a hot name for it. You've told me that a hundred times already! You told me before. Azalea Hotel? It's not that, this time. You know, I thought about that. Azalea is easy for us to remember, but how will foreigners get it? So I'm saying, I thought about that all night. "Welcome"! It's gonna be "Welcome Hotel"! Easy to understand, easy to say! It's friendly, charming, and... What else? Ah! Welcome Hotel! We welcome blacks! We welcome whites! We welcome the Japanese! We welcome the Chinese! The point is, We don't care about race Or skin color! Right! What do you think? Isn't it grand? You're keeping the money safe that I gave you, right? When the time comes, That's gonna be the seed money for our business. When we build the hotel, Let's set up a beauty salon for us in there! It's only 500,000 won now. That's the beginning! You know, once you start, you're halfway done. A good start is half the battle. But my priority is, Paying for my little brother's education. If I have to, I'll sell my body and give him an education. You should hear yourself. You shouldn't say things like that. Talking about whoring yourself. It's a figure of speech. You've got a full plate, too. Learning hair techniques, Supporting your brother! When I get my license, I'm gonna open an unregistered perm place. It makes more money that way Than doing it legally. I have to say, You're more savvy than I thought! Oh, this is nothing special. Sure. I'm nothing special, either. Wanna make out? You smell like kimchi! Brush your teeth already! You dummy! Brushing your teeth again? Save some water! Stop wasting! You should have seen the water bill last month. Eat more. A guy like you should eat more. Until when are you gonna work at the barber? You're gonna spend your life shampooing hair? What should I do, then? How many times did I tell you? Opportunity knocks on every man's door. You have to seize it. It hasn't knocked on my door. Do you know anything about life? You gotta set a goal first. Any goal is fine. Heaven helps those who help themselves! You should learn a skill, a sure thing. You know the times we live in. It's going to be harder and harder to get by. There're too many people. I hear there're some lucky countries. Like West Germany. They encourage people to have a lot of kids. If you have a certain number of children, The president offers to be the godfather of your youngest. It's not only them. In France, if you have a child, Medical services are free, Formula and strollers are free, too. They just give those away. What's more, if you have a third child, The state pays you a big bonus. And they give you a loan so that you can have a bigger home. Taxes, transportation, tuition. Great benefits. You know a lot! How do you know all those things? I read it in the paper... Hey! Chunsik! What are you doing up there? Come down right now! Miss Yu! Miss Yu! I love you. What? Miss Yu! You! Stop fooling around! Come down! Right now! Miss Yu! Aren't you gonna marry someday? Hey! Do you live here? Apartments for Sale Excuse me! Look! I need to ask something. Do you know where 151 Seonggok-dong is? You don't know? That address sounds familiar, though. - Gosh! Nothing is easy here! - Another country girl came to Seoul. Hey! Your fly is open! Who is it? It's, it's the Chinese delivery. Be careful! Don't spill! Put them here. Hello. Why are you so surprised? Bring us two cups of coffee. Go on. Come here, and sit please. - Me? - Yes. Why are you sitting there? I mean, sit up here. I apologize for the last time. No, no worries. How many spoonfuls of sugar? Pardon? Have you never had coffee before? Huh? Oh, yes. First time at a place like this. Help yourself. Try it. Oh! That's hot! I, I have to go. Wait. This is for the food I spilled last time. Oh, no! I didn't even bring your scarf. Take it. My arm hurts. Keep the scarf. It's my gift for you. A little higher. - It feels good! - Here? Yes, a little higher! Your hands are magic. Nothing like your touch. Miss Yu, you're looking suspicious these days. Why, sir? Are you dating someone, Miss Yu? Maybe you met a nice guy. You're getting prettier. If only that were true. Are you saying you don't have a boyfriend yet? Who would want me to be his girlfriend? Really? You want me to introduce someone nice? - Dang! It's cold! - I'm sorry. Shit! I get colds easily. Get a grip, boy! I'm so sorry, sir. Oh, dear! Brother! What are you doing here? Geez! You shoud've written the address clearly. Do you know how much trouble I went through to find you? Come this way. Why'd you come up to Seoul? Why? Shouldn't I come to Seoul, like everyone else? You know what I mean. Don't worry. I didn't come to Seoul without a plan. I'm not gonna burden you. My friend at the Yeongdeungpo factory says they have a position for me there. I'm gonna go there, tomorrow morning. But still, you didn't even contact me. Good heavens! You don't know me at all? Hey, we meet again. You, you're here to see Chunsik? Yes, he's my brother. Do you know each other? She's my little sister. So you're a bumpkin from the boondocks who's been calling us country bumpkins this whole time. Oh, how ridiculous is that? My wife likes having you guys here. She's too generous too you. Chunsik! Here! This is for your sister. Take it. I already owe Gilnam for the inn and Deokbae for the food. You guys are not rich. Don't be silly. I didn't actually pay for your sister's motel. Nah, all I did was sweet talk the innkeeper into giving us a free room. Yeah, it's the same with me. I told Cho it's for my sister, and he didn't charge. It's the first anyone's treated me like a human being since I came up to Seoul. You guys are the first. Now, there're no young people in the country. It's all old folks and kids. Farming isn't even a job any more. Young people won't slave away for nothing. Farming doesn't even pay a wage. Anyway, Mom must be very lonely. Now that you've come up to Seoul, too. Brother, Please tell me you aren't gonna get upset. What? What are you trying to say? I'm saying, Mom is not alone. What do you mean? You know she's now forty. I can't tell her to live by herself. Ten years is enough. It's rough there, and she doesn't even have any land and no relatives. Besides, she can't rely on the son in Seoul who doesn't call her. I insisted she remarry. You mean, she actually remarried? You know I'm just a daughter. She'll have no one once I leave to marry someone. And by then, no one would wanna take a granny. I insisted on her marrying while she's still young. Please don't be upset. Who's the man? You know my friend Jeomnye living down in Saeteo? Her father? Why? What's wrong with him? - Maybe it's a good thing. - Of course it's a good thing. You know he's a nice man. I haven't been a good son to her. I hope Mom's happy with her husband. Oh! I thought Weren't you gonna stay at the hospital tonight? I can't sleep. Let's go inside. So, how's his condition? Oh, who cares! It's not the kind of disease that gets cured overnight! Oh! You filthy sons of bitches! I know! I know what you're doing! I know! Dirty fuckers! I know what you're up to! I know! I know! I know what you're doing! Come out here! I'm gonna kill you both! I'll kill you both. Boy, this is none of our business. No! I know it all! I became like this because of that. Geez! Be quiet! You're crazy! My mom was like that, too! And then she ran away! She abandoned me! You've got it wrong. No, I didn't! I saw it with my own eyes! You don't know about this stuff... just tell yourself you saw it wrong. Aren't you angry? Damn retard! Yes, yes, sir. You're right, sir. Yes, yes, sir. How could I refuse a great man like you? Yes, sir. Miss Yu, a call for you. Me? Yes, you. Is there another Miss Yu here? It's strange to get a call. Hello? Go on. Yes, I will. Get some good food for yourself. Er, what are you doing? Why? Am I not supposed to be here? - Out of my way! - Yes, sir. - Get out! - Yes! Deokbae! What are you doing? Take this! You are busy. Hey, why don't you have a little drink, Miss Yu? It's the middle of the day. One drink can't hurt. Yeah, take it. Here, go ahead. Bottoms up. You sure can drink! Oh, Miss Yu. Do you know how to dance? No, I haven't learned. Geez, a modern girl like you should learn ballroom dancing. So? Don't you wanna learn? I'd like to learn. Then it's done. Let's start tonight. By the way, aren't you gonna give me a drink? These hands are magic. You're like an enchantress. Sit over there! How much is it? Thank you, good-bye! Ready to order? Jajangmyeon please! Why are you doing this? You're gonna get into trouble. You should think about your condition. Don't worry. I know my body. Cho! What're you doing? Delivery at your age? I've gained weight. I'm just trying to lose some belly fat. Ah, when are you gonna change the restaurant sign? Hush! You need to do better bookkeeping. There are many mistakes. Oh, dear! Oh my god! Call the hospital! Deokbae! Get a cab! I told him he shouldn't work, many times. Suntae, Suntae called me a retard I wanna live longer even as a retard. I wanna live long. Oh, jeez, what's happening! You must have been starving. Don't think about the money, just eat. Give him it already! Deokbae! The restaurant owner guy is an idiot. He's, he's dead. Roll with the punches. Turn a blind eye. Turn a deaf ear. Even if you have something to say, act like a mute. I didn't stutter before. But after a few years in Seoul, I couldn't say things Or do things like I wanted. Do you really have somewhere to go? Don't worry! I'm not like you. Used to pull cons in front of Seoul Station. Sorry I can't give you more. Drop me a line as soon as you settle down. Go. Thank you, Deokbae. Deokbae! I'll stut, stutter from now on, too! Okay. Hey! Oh, that must be heavy! - It's your day off? - No, I'm on the night shift today. I owe you guys a lot for the other day. This is nothing. just socks. Thank you so much. Don't mention it. Oh, can you give the other one to him? Gilnam. That's his name, right? It's a strange coincidence. You and me, running into each other in the street twice. Don't you think so? I don't know, maybe? You, you don't like me, do you? I'm sure you don't like me. Because I act like a boy. You don't like that, right? I'm too feisty. Er, it's not that. Hello? Is she your girlfriend? No. Then who is she? My, my, my friend's sis, sis, sister. You're on a date with your friend's sister. Hey, look here. It's none of your business whether I'm his girlfriend or not. I don't know what's up with you two, But it's rude to interrupt like that. A woman driving around in her own fancy car! You, are you free on Sunday? Pardon? Sunday. Are you free? I can show you some fun stuff. Why, don't you want to? No, I'd like to. Then, you come to my place by 10 on Sunday. I'll be waiting for you. Young lady, bye-bye! Oh! Deokbae, you sure know how to play the game! When did you get a pretty Seoul girlfriend like that? Well, well. Look! Don't get too smug! I think you're gonna get played by her. It always rains on Sundays. People say you're dating a female driver. No, shut up. Don't be all sneaky. Chunsun told me everything. She's not a driver. She owns the car. Holy shit. Hey! Where are you going, all shiny and new? Oh, it's you. You're busy even on a Sunday. Did they kick you out of Donghwaru? Poor soul. You can't come up with anything else. What's happening? You couldn't get it with your shit for brains even if I explained. Forget it! Go screw yourself! What are you doing? Huh? Did you order Chinese? No, he says you told him to come. I did? Oh. I'm so forgetful. Is today Sunday? I totally forgot. And made plans to sleep all day. I'm sorry! It's okay. How much is it? It's 9,500 won in total. I got it here, 9,500 won. It's my treat. Oh, Deokbae! Wasn't that girl jealous the other day? No, she wasn't. You two got closer thanks to me, right? No, no way. There's nothing between us, really. Are you saying you've never dated a girl? No. No way, have you ever kissed a girl? Have you? No. Well, then. Shalll I teach you? What are you doing? I'm waiting. Really? Jeez! Don't make me wait. Er... I mean, I'm not sure if it's okay. Goodness! just do it! This is fun! I knew you'd do that. Deokbae! Come find me! She thinks I'm her toy. What're you doing? Come find me! Find me! Deokbae! Deokbae! Are you angry, Deokbae? Let's get going. Let's dance! - Come! - No, no... I can't. Just dance any way you want! See, like this! Blowing wind, blow away Doesn't matter if anyone knows What lies deep inside a man All I have to my name Is the boiling blood in my heart Here they come. The winds are coming. The winds of change are blowing On this good, windy day, my dreams take flight Doesn't matter if anyone knows What lies deep inside a man All I have to my name Is the boiling blood in my heart All I have to my name Are the guts of a twenty-year-old Sorrows of life are fleeting The winds of change are blowing Here they come. The winds are coming. The winds of change are blowing On this fine windy day, my dreams take flight Doesn't matter if anyone knows What lies deep inside a man All I have to my name Is the boiling blood in my heart What the hell is that? Bravo! Do you really wanna learn how to kiss? Stop! Get out! Now! If you come around and pester me over this You'll be sorry, got it? I knew it. Chunsun was right. Miss Yu. You have a talent for dancing. Miss Yu. Would you like to be my girlfriend? People like you, People who are well-off like you can have fun. I can't afford that. In my family, I'm the only source of income. I have enough trouble feeding the family. With the money problem, there's a solution. If you let me help you. Huh? Is this your father? No. He's a loner. All by himself, nowhere to go. He doesn't live here, does he? Long ago, we all lived here. Long ago? It wasn't actually not that long ago. It was the countryside, just a few years ago. Those were good times. Paddies far and wide, nice people. They cheated him out of all that land. Miss Yu. How about I give you a massage this time? Until today, I wanted to come to a place like this with the man I love. Even though you don't mean it, Would you please tell me you love me? I mean it, Miss Yu. I really love you. I love you. I've never told you this before, But my father is a plasterer. He is penniless, but he's a dear father to me. People say plasterers get paid better now, But my dad can't work because he's ill. And in his sickbed, he's always worrying over me. He's worried that I'll work at a bar Or some place indecent to help my family. You know about roots, Chunsik? Roots? Like cabbage roots? Like Kunta Kinte from Roots. They say my grandpa was a horsehair hat maker. You know, if I traced my roots, I'd find generations upon generations of laborers. Plasterers. Hat makers. Tinkers. Paperhangers. Shamans. Chunsik, do you ever wonder What the rich people's roots are like? I know very well how people see me. A country hick who used to sell cabbages That became rich overnight because of property speculation. They talk behind my back, I know. They say I've forgotten where I came from And that I'm a loan shark who steals from empty pockets. You think the world would be a better place if I quit this? Bullshit! There're plenty of others who would do the same. I feel ridiculous Confiding in you like this, Miss Yu. Maybe even a man like me Can feel lonely sometimes. Excuse me, does Changho Cho work here? Cho, Chang ho Cho? You mean Mr. Cho? Yes. He's thirty-five years old. And fat. How do you know Mr. Cho? He's the father of these children. Then he can't be Mr. Cho. Our Mr. Cho isn't married. You're at the wrong place. It can't be true. I have the letter from him. It says Donghwaru. Here. What? Dammit! That bitch's gonna mess up an almost finished job! After I told her to wait just a year longer. I have no choice. Time to face the music. Just my luck. - Honey! - Dad! Hi. Dad is busy. Shit! Son of a bitch! What? A bachelor? You have two kids, and call yourself a bachelor? Son of a bitch! I'll kill you! You bastard! Get out! Right now! Get out of here! Son of a bitch! I'm going! Go! Get out! Bastard! I'm leaving! - Let go! - What do you think you're doing? Don't you dare take a single thing from this house! I've got to get my things! I gotta take what I worked for! Oh, you're really asking for it! You're lucky I don't put you in a jail for fraud, you bastard! Honey, let's just go. I've got some money saved. Oh, I see! You've saved the money he stole from me! Look here. I didn't get a penny from my husband. I earned my money from toiling in the fields. How dare do you leave me? - You can't leave! You bastard! - Let go of me! I'm sorry this is goodbye. I guess I'm not someone who can pull off a con. Take care, you people! Did you miss your dad? Let's go. My baby! Okay, just go! Mr. Hwang! Take care, Deokbae! I'm sorry if I've been mean. Tell Suntae everything turned out okay. I'll take the bag. Say thank you. Oh, that's too much. You're not rich. - Take care. - I will, I will. Good bye. Hey, Mr. Cho! Where are you heading now? I've got my skills. I won't starve! - Good luck! - Okay, bye-bye! Oh, hang on! Today, like any other day - So long! - I walk this endless road Tears pooled in every footprint Foghorns wailing by the docks Longing for an old flame on this endless lonesome road Oh, what took so long? Push the plates over here! Yes! Hey! Give us some over here, too! Hurry it up! I've waited so long! Geez! Hurry up already! You help him out! - Over here too! - Be careful with the plates! What have you got against us? Huh? Yes, you don't like us! Why, why wouldn't I? I don't know. Who knows? Right? We're just young paying customers trying to have fun here. Entertain us! - She's good! - Hey! Come here! You call this number, Tell Myunghee to get over here quick. Who should I say is calling? This guy is Jeongsu Kim. Tell her it's her groom. - Groom! - Do it! That's right! Hello? Hello? Who's this? Pardon? What did you say? Crazy bastard! Dumb loser. Hey, I don't know anyone by that name. Hello? Who are you? Really? Okay, tell him to wait. It's closing time. Tell them to leave. Hey, Deokbae! Never mind. Deokbae! From tomorrow, you take the counter in place of Cho. Excuse me! It's time to close! Hey! Bring the big guy. The guy that looks like a beanstalk! Tell him to get over here. Come on, we're closing! Hey! Kid! Close the door! One! Two! Three! Four! Five! Did you call me? Yes. You! Did you call her? Why hasn't she gotten here yet? Are you trying to embarrass me? How would I know why she hasn't come? Hey, asshole! Did you make the call or not? Do not call me names. Well, look what we have here. Who're you calling asshole? Look at this little shit all cocky and everything. There it goes again. You better watch it. Think about it! How would I... Oh, you're asking for it. Get over here, you bastard! You can't talk sense into an idiot like that. - No! - You gotta knock some sense into him. - See that dumb look on his face? - Leave him alone. All cocky and shit. - Are you for real? - Stupid ass! What? What did you say? Lanky bastard! Get over here! I knew this'd happen. Myunghee always brings trouble. Over here! Here! Who started this? What the hell? Kick him! Kick him! Indoor Duty I can't hear you! What? In front of 48 Seonggok-dong? At 17:20, a car accident? Get in! I'll give you a ride. Get in! Do not litter. I feel like shit. If I get rich, I'll raise my children like them. But I'm gonna break their legs if they behave like that. Money is great, but you gotta be a decent person first. Don't you think? Sports and Culture What are you doing? You're injured worse than I thought. Did you hurt yourself anywhere else? Let me take a look. You sure are shy for a man. Come on out here. How could someone in right mind Beat up a gentle soul like you? He must be one crazy son of a bitch. Oh, look. This won't do. Let's go down and put a hot pack on you. Come on. I'm okay. Be honest. Didn't you get hurt because of that Seoul bitch? No. Oh, come on! I have ears and eyes. What did I tell you? I said she's gonna get you in trouble, right? You gotta know your place. Why are you looking at me like that? You're making me blush. Aren't you going to the factory today? It's my day off. Hey! Deokbae! That dude is smooth. Do you like what you see? Yes, it's super!

Hey, you guys. Oh, Mr. Lee. Why do you have a baby on your back? Where's your wife? Why? He's my little son. What'll it be, huh? Soju? Your wife must be very ill. - Don't even mention her. - Huh? - She passed away. - What? Why the long faces? You should have fun. That's why you're here. Oh my, is that true? Yes.

The living have no problems. I got arms. I got a mouth for eating. Damn. She was a kind lady.

I named it Welcome Hotel! We welcome blacks. We welcome whites. We welcome the Japanese. We welcome the Chinese. In other words, we don't care about race or color! How's that? Isn't it nice?

Right? Friends you make away from home are true friends, too! You are one in fifty million I am one in fifty million The odds of you and I Crossing paths Is fifty million Times one over fifty million Best friends forever. July, 1980. But then The miracle that brought us together Can never ease The pain of our parting. I thought I'd get to kick back once the construction was done. I'm trusting you to take care of this, you hear? Yes, sir! All you give is lip service. Go on home. Good night, sir. Are you not feeling well? What is it? Huh? Who the hell are you? Hey! Isn't he the boy from the barber shop? You!

We welcome the Chinese. Anyway, when I come back three years from now, You'll be a boxing champion. Right? Yes, I'll try. Good. Mr. Shampoo will be released from prison then, and I hope we'll reminisce about old times. When was the last time you visited your hometown? Your mom will be happy to see you. But I'll have to leave right away. It'll just make her sadder. Get on the train. Before it takes off. Still, I got rich after I came to Seoul. Now I've got a bag. That's, that's not the only thing. You have me and Chunsik. Yeah, you're right. Deokbae! This one's for the road. For you, Gilnam. I'm sorry it's nothing fancy. Chunsik would have given you a better sendoff. No, this is good. Thank you. Deokbae! I'm asking you two one last favor. You two, don't let go until I'm out of sight. Deokbae! Go visit Chunsik often. And please find Jinok for me! Wait.

It's been two years in Seoul. In a word, it's a decent place to live. When you take a beating like this you learn something. It's as if I've been taking a beating for two years straight From some invisible person. Who is it? Well, I don't know. Anyway, I'm confident I can take a hit. Doesn't matter if anyone knows What lies deep inside a man All I have to my name Is the boiling blood in my heart They're here. The winds are coming. The winds of change are blowing On this fine, windy day, my dreams take flight Doesn't matter if anyone knows What lies deep inside a man All I have to my name Is the boiling blood in my heart The End
