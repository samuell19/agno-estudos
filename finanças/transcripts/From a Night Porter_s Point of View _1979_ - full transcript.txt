I like them war films best. You know, cowboy films and that. When there's some shooting or a battle l'm well-pleased. 'Cause them love movies don't do much for me, they don't tickle me fancy, if you like. l like them more violent films, with fights an'all. They're a good laugh.... From a Night Porter's Point of View Drop to the ground. Spread them or l'll pin you down myself. What did you chuck just then? - No. - What, nothing? Let's look in that bag. Who told you to do that? - What? - Dance... This time it went better. At least the detainee tried to get away. The other one practically walked into our hands. The guard put himself out a bit there. He followed the correct checking procedure. He got him to spread his legs and carried out a basic check. People come in, your guard's there. They go out, your guard's there, be it me or the other one. Nobody has the right to leave early. Let him be a colonel. or a general himself. He can try me. Your bags, please. Thank you. What have we got here? oh, nothing. Get on with it, gents. Thank you. Good-bye. When l'm here they've got to clock in, and if they don't... Why aren't you clocking in? Get on with it, mate. Then the commander files a report and there's a penalty. And the committee looks into it. The committee are reliable people. There's the Company Council... There's the Party Secretary. From then on you're branded, you know. This way, you can't go in there now. Good-bye. - Sort of a German shepherd, is it? - Yes, sort of. - Alright, let me see your lD, please. - Here you are. Here are some guidelines... and the rabies vaccination certificate. ok, that's good. Hello, animal shelter... Everyone loves something, isn't it? Me, l love running checks on people, you know. l love checking up on me fellow fishermen, like those lot over there. l'll just take their rods away. lf they haven't got their permits in order, or use nets, l'll secure their fishing tackle. You could say that this is my hobby. That's what l do. l'll take that tackle away l'll give them a receipt and a date and hour when to come and collect it. Because, suppose he comes at a different time, well, he won't get that tackle back. l can buy that fishing tackle if l fancy. Suppose it cost 500 then we buy it half price, 150, for instance. The roller, the rod, even the line. l can buy the lot. l'm due my 30-year bonus soon. A medal and some money in an envelope. Maybe 500, maybe 600, depends. They call this reward a present, you know. For an honorary volunteer, you know. Normally, masters have sealing-tongues for sealing the warehouses. Every warehouse must be sealed. The raw materials warehouse must be sealed too, because if it isn't we file a report to the manager. once the director reads the book he doesn't muck about, just chops the quarterly bonuses. Here's a youngster. Take a seat, please. We've got our first young man. Good morning. You're taking a test for a fisherman's card, aren't you. Here's a question: How many rods are you allowed to use at any one time? - one. - only one. - Can you use live fish as bait? - No Young people can't. Here's a tricky one for you. - ls the perch a preserved species? - No, it isn't. Excellent answers. You've passed. Here you are. Thank you. - ls there no one else? - There's somebody else... Ask them in. When we do a raid, in Serock and that, we arrive in a van, 15 or 20 of us. And we do the check. We also do it at night, with the dogs, you know. Bring the photos for Thursday. Stay, stay... Don't, don't move, girl. Come, doggy, come here, come on. Sit! Come on, sit, lie. Stay! Stay! Stay! Come, come doggy. Come here. Where do you think you're going? Want a clout? Stay there. Parents come to us and ask to do some checks, like outside cinemas and that. Because some kids want to watch films and not go to school. May l... So, we nab them. Come the summer, we go around parks, and look for groups of boys and girls sitting around. We go up and say, l want to see your lD, and if l see you around here again you're going to a detention centre. And there you go. We take that child's lD. And he is terrified and begs you to give it back and swears he won't do it again. We write an official letter and we place such a child ln a detention centre. And that child learns from it. And when he leaves the centre he's a perfect child... - Good-bye. - Good-bye. l think that them youths have too much freedom these days. They're running wild. They need to be put on a leash. Take, for example, that long hair tight jeans or them flares, moustaches, beards, sideburns and what not. True, l've got me sideburns too, but, you know, it's not like you're aggressive or anything just cause you've got sideburns. l hate that sort, you know. - Don't strangle me. - l won't strangle you, don't worry. - What next? - And now, here. This way, you put that through there... Wait, wait... This way. You put that through there and pull. There. That's not tied. Untangle it then. You did it wrong there. l like animals best. l don't like it when an animal gets neglected or abused. l used to have fish. The kind that swim in a glass tank. But my daughter poured some boiling hot water from the tap and they got stewed, you know. l had to chuck them out. They were good for nothing then. l used to keep budgies but they've snuffed it too. My son, let them out and one fell into a pot of soup. once that happens the creature's got no chance, you know. Don't look that way. Go get him... Back to me, crawl. Here you bag of spew... here... l said, here. Come back here now. Regulations are more important than people. lf you don't comply you're on your way out. You're in the sewer. And children, and adults must comply with the regulations... This beautiful world is for them. To my mind, there must be a death penalty. But do it in a way that the offender goes to the gallows in public. Hang him publicly so that tens and hundreds can see. Nowadays, people like to criticise the state, you know. lf you ask me, they shouldn't, you know. And all this nitpicking. l don't like that, l don't. Not a bit. Generally, l'd just crush that. Make a decent line, will you. 13th May, 1g77, shift starting 7 am ending 7 pm. - Guard commander, Stefan Pi?atowicz. - Present. Wac?aw G?uchowski is already on duty. - Marian osuch... - Present. You wish you were in a higher position, you know, a responsible position. For me, personally, that'd be very nice, that would. Now, children, look at that nicely dressed man. What a beautiful hat he's got. Do you know this man's profession? This is a... Joa?ka... Krzysiek, you might tell us... This is ...
