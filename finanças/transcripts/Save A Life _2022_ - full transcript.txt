Honestly, don't take this wrong way. I didn't want to be you. Wait, what does that mean? I didn't want to be alone. Listen, I might have felt lonely every once in a while, but I wasn't alone. I had my baby and I had you. Okay. And after what happened to his dad, I just focused all my energies on my baby. And between that work and school, there really wasn't time for anything else. Yeah, but didn't you want love? You know, someone to hold you, feel you? Well, I had love. You know what I mean? After [indistinct] died. There really wasn't time for that. And you know me, there was never any shortage of men that will hold me when I wanted to be held, and when I want to be bothered, I could touch myself. That's how your ass got carpal tunnel. Shut up no, that is because all that typing I was doing at work, thank you. Okay, yeah sure.

What you mean where I'm going? I'm going to my last class. I don't get no kiss. I didn't think you wanted one, because you've been real quiet ever since. Now that you're done thinking for me, I have a question. They got this whole huge event at the end of the year, I don't really see what the big deal is, but apparently you get all dressed up, rent limousines and tuxes and shit, and take a date. So your parents can go crazy. Invite the whole family, the neighborhood to come take pictures. I wasn't even going to go. But I know how much you like to get dressed up. So What's up, trying to go? [car door opens] It's about damn time you asked me to prom, thought I was going to have to take one of your little homeboy. Haha, you funny. Oh, our colors are black and white. Forget a limo. I want a black [indistinct]. Leather interior, all black everything. Yeah, all right. I'm not playing Kordell. [soft sensual music] I am not looking forward to getting back out there. I don't want to be in a club at the bar, trolling for dates, what? That's for teeny babars. Oh my God, well girl even though you're right. We used to be in the club. I know, till they closed the doors down, they got to kick our asses out. Oh, girl we was bad. We was bad shit crazy back then. I know. Remember when we met those dudes at the club and we let them talk us into taking us home with them. Oh my God, well we was fine, we was doing fine into that big dude said, he was like, wait, what did he say? "You so cute, I'm going to handcuff you to the bed." Your face, oh girl you was so scared. I was praying like, Lord. If you get us out of this one. Yes, Jesus. Never ever happen again ever, ever. Ever, ever. Ever ever. We had to fight our way out of there, and that's when I started carrying that gun. Because I was like, we are never getting caught up like that again. Yeah, and we didn't, we did not. Especially with you carrying Jody around. Hmm wait, why I name it Jody? God your so drunk, you don't never remember nothing. Is because when I was telling you about that dude Jody Stevens, who barely got his pants down before he came. Oh. He shot me dead, in the eye. I named my gun after that speed and the accuracy. [door bell rings] Where she at? Who that? Kordell baby, what was you doing here? Can't drive like this, one, two, three. Okay, okay. Oh my baby. Oh, he loves me girl. Is just, what would I do without you? Come on. Oh no, I'm missing something. I'm missing, oh, bye bitch. Be quiet ma. Hey, don't tell me to be quiet, I'm your mama. You all too old for this.

You seem a little hungover too. No, I'm fine. Me and your mom's just celebrating my divorce that's all, grown folk stuff. I know, I'm happy for you. You deserve better than [indistinct], you deserve a good man. What do you know about it? Someone who will treat you like a queen. What are you doing? Someone young and fresh, like he had. Stay out of of my business Kordell. I'm trying to make you my business, Ms. Savvy. Don't call me that, you need to leave. You don't want me to leave, you want me touching it you, like this.

I called Savvy to find out what time you picked up my car and she didn't answer the phone. So where were you Kordell and don't lie to me? Okay mom, look, I've been feeling a little overwhelmed, with everything mom, school, football I mean trying to figure out where I want to go to school versus where everybody wants me to play. I need a break, this one day. I know. I know that this is a lot on you and this is the first time that you've had this much pressure, I get that. But you still cannot just skip school all day and say the hell with all your responsibilities. Because if I did that shit, we wouldn't have food to eat or a roof over our heads. I know ma, you're right, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, mom. Um, you still didn't answer my question. Where were you? Oh, Just some girl house. Oh, I take it her parents weren't home.

You did what? Niecy I tried to stop him. Stop him, it should have never even started. Mom listen, it was on me. It's not her fault. How is it not her fault? You are a child Kordell, you're my child. And why are you telling your child my business? You told him intimate details about my marriage. About Larry getting that girl pregnant. You know how painful the situation this has been for me and very damaging to my ego. So when he started whispering in my ear and [indistinct] me, I don't even know what happened. So you saying it's my fault that you fucked my child. Stop calling me a child. Who the fuck you think you talking to like that Kordell [indistinct]? Niecy stop he's too old for you to be trying to whoop him. Uh-uh, see you all got me all the way fucked up. Niecy, I'm sorry. I told you, I'm not like you. I don't do well by myself and it shouldn't have happened. I don't even know how I gave in. Because you a weak bitch. Niecy, please forgive me. It shouldn't have happened.

I certainly wasn't your baby, when you sat me down and gave me the, you're the man of the house now speech. You treat me like I'm grown. If you say one more disrespectful ass thing out of your mouth, you will join your father sooner than you thought. I just can't believe that you all are playing in my face right now. Please understand, Niecy I was weak. It's been such a long time since anybody gave me any kind of attention or touched me. I was hung over and I wasn't thinking clearly Niecy, I'm sorry, I was wrong. I made a mistake, I know that. And I understand how you must be feeling right now. No, no, you can't understand how I'm feeling. Your selfish could never understand how I'm feeling Savvy. Because it's always an episode of the Savvy show. Whatever Savvy wants Savvy gets. It wasn't like you wasn't known to be a hoe back in the day. Mom. What? It's true and I should know better than anyone. Okay, that's the anger talking, so I'm going to let that slide, but you got one more time, told you I was sorry.
