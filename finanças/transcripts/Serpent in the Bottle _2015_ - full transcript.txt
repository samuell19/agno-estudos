Anyway, I'm on my way over. We're going to pick out rings today, remember? So I'll be there in like five minutes, okay? Love you, bye. (KNOCKS) What's wrong with you? (SIGHS) Jesus. Could you have possible found an apartment on the second floor instead of the fifth? Why didn't you take the elevator? JACKIE: Ah, it wasn't working, again. And that guy who works here, he's always somewhere and just hanging out. Who, John? He's harmless. You're so dramatic. (LAUGHING) Maybe. He creeps me out. We're getting a new apartment when you're done with school. I am not walking up five flights of stairs forever. You're so cute. I could just eat you up. (SMOOCHING) Five minutes and we'll go, okay? Okay, five minutes. Hurry up. We have some serious shopping to do. Oh, I ran into Amy Pringle today. Remember her? We met her last summer over at Joe's? Cute, cropped hair, big boobs. She's going out with that lawyer Patrick. Anyway. She's pregnant and she's keeping it, can you believe that? Jesus, a kid's the last thing I would want right now. (SIGHS) And he's so gross, I can't figure out why she has sex with him. Maybe he has a really big cock. Would you mind closing the door when you use the bathroom? It's not very ladylike. Really, and who said I was a lady? Are you done yet? Yes. Shit. This is so annoying! (HAMMERING) Trent. Hey man, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you like that. Sorry about the elevator, dude. It's this old building, it's got a lot of quirks, you know? It's okay. Um, hey, I put a check in the mail for you, you should get it in a few days. Nice, nice, thank you. I appreciate that. So how you doing? You're getting hitched soon, right? - Five weeks. - Five weeks, wow. My old lady and I living together for 20 years. Married for 16. Lived our first four years in sin. But I gotta tell you those are the best four years of my life, huh? I need to ask you a favor, Trent. Uh, sure, yeah, alright. It's my father in law. I gotta find him a place to stay. Uh, I don't, uh... It'd just be for maybe two or three days at the most. Listen, I'd make it worth your while. I don't know, Mr. Morris. You're getting married. What if I give you two months' rent for free? Okay? You need the money, come on, you're getting married for christsake. I don't know, Mr. Morris. I don't even know him. Why doesn't he stay with you?

Listen, I'd really appreciate it if you didn't smoke in here. Okay? Please don't touch my things. Oh yeah, your girlfriend called. She said she was sorry about last night and that you should call her. JACKIE: Hello, Trent? I guess you're not home. Or you just don't wanna talk to me. Anyway, um, I just wanted to tell you that I'm going to New York for one day. - Hmm. - Uh... - She sounds sexy. - There's a gallery opening up and they wanna talk to me about a showing. And that I don't respect your wishes, well sometimes... What, you don't believe in sex? - I just think that... - Could you please? - I'm trying to hear this. - Maybe we should try and explore. I don't know. Anyway, I'm sorry I offended you. Call me when you get this, I'll see you in a couple days. Okay? Ciao. Hey why don't they have sex ed and driver's ed in Mexico on the same day? It's too hard on the fucking donkeys. Hey have you ever been to a donkey show? - No. - Really? It's something else. You oughta, you oughta check it out sometime. (DOOR SLAMS) Yeah. Yeah, I understand. No, it's okay, I'm not mad at you, you just, you just had a little too much to drink and you were happy. I was happy too. Man, you know, I still am. Uh, I gotta go. Um, let me call you back. No no no no, let me just call you back, okay, okay? Alright, bye. Excuse me. Could you please flush? It's kinda gross. Oh, sorry. Was that your old lady? (TOILET FLUSHES) You know, the chick from last night, the one that wants to bang you. Yeah, that's my fiancee, Jackie. So, uh... So this girl, she's your fiancee. You haven't fucked her? TRENT: I don't believe in sex before marriage. What? You're kidding me! Well wait a minute, you're telling me that your fiancee is begging you to fuck her and you won't do it? I believe that if we really love each other then we should wait. So you're a Jesus freak. TRENT: No, I'm not a Jesus freak. I was raised very religious but I'm not religious now. What do you mean you're not religious? You won't fuck until you're married? The only people I know like that are religious. What kind of job you getting? TRENT: I'm almost done with law school. (LAUGHS) Just what the world needs, another fucking lawyer. So what do you get when you send a prostitute to law school? I don't know, what? Fucking know it all. What can a goose do, a duck can't, and a lawyer should? I'm not sure. Stick his bill up his ass. So what's the deal with all the cars? It's morning, isn't it? I don't know. Something I started doing when I was a kid. Dad gave me the first car. - Eh? - No thanks. You don't smoke weed? Kind of a trippy fucker, aren't you? You don't smoke weed, you don't drink, you don't fuck. What do you do for fun? You clean house? Well, uh, I better get going. I have class in a moment. So I guess I'll see you later. (SLAMS DOOR) (TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING) (DRAMATIC ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) (PHONE RINGING) Is that Jackie? AUTOMATED VOICE: Hello, we are not available now. Please leave your name and phone number after the beep. We will return your call. (BEEPS) Hello? Is anyone home? Trent, you screening your calls? Jesus, I wish you'd get a cell phone. Uh, so I just got in from New York and I wanted to see you but I was calling to tell you that I'm on my way over and I have a surprise for you. But I won't be there for a little while, maybe 30 or 40 minutes. I need to make a stop first. Okay. Ciao. (KNOCKING) Trent. Oh. (LAUGHS) Uh, I'm sorry, I was looking for Trent, so... You must be Jackie. Yeah. You're even more beautiful than Trent described. (LAUGHS) Thank you. Um, I'm sorry, I don't know who you are. Oh, excuse me, my name is Marvin. And Trent's being gracious enough to let me stay with him for a few days. Just between you and me, I'm in between homes. (LAUGHING) But please come in, you're welcome to wait. Trent just stepped out for a moment. We could have a glass of wine. It's rare that I get the company of such a beautiful lady. (LAUGHS) Sure, uh... Yeah. So you mean to say that you were selling diamonds in Vietnam to the guys in the jungle? Yeah. Exactly. But I made good money. All I had to do is go out there in the field with those guys and tell them they needed to send something to their girls back home. And that was it. A lot of them didn't believe they were gonna be coming back home anyway, so. If they could send something beautiful to their girls back home, it made it a little better. Can you understand that? Yeah. Yeah, I understand. It seems, I just seems kinda fucked up. MARVIN: Oh. That whole conflict was fucked up. Yeah, well all war is fucked up, I guess. MARVIN: Yeah. - Want more? - Join in. Gracias. (LAUGHING) (SALSA MUSIC) (LAUGHING) You know how to salsa. Would you like to dance? (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Whoa, si, you speak Spanish also? (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) (LAUGHING) I'm fluent in five languages. (SINGING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Five languages? - Mm hmm. - Wow, which ones? Whoops, sorry, I'm a little rusty here. (LAUGHING) It's okay. You're a very good dancer though. You dance much? Uh, I used to dance. I do go out with my girlfriends sometimes. Well you and Trent seem to be very different. Yes, he grounds me. I was pretty wild. Does that make sense? I guess if you wanna be grounded. I mean, how long have you two been engaged? Uh, three months, we've been together for six. Six? You've been together for six months and you're gonna get married. (LAUGHING) I know. It's pretty evolved myself, getting married, to be honest. Well, everybody should be married once I guess. (LAUGHING) Have you ever been married? Yeah, I was married once, a long time ago. Ooh, ooh! You mind if I get a drag? Oh not at all. Thank you. Don't tell Trent. Oh, your secret's safe with me. (LAUGHING) I don't usually smoke but at times like this I enjoy a drag or two. I can understand that. What about weed? You smoke that? I love to smoke pot. (LAUGHING) I love to smoke pot. Well I have some, you wanna smoke some with me. Really, you have some here? Well it's not here, it's in the Bat Cave. Ah. (LAUGHING) But I can get to it quickly. You're a very interesting fellow, Marvin. Adventurer, dancer, you speak five languages, crime fighter. Any more surprises? (LAUGHS) Baby, you don't even know. (LAUGHING) Now if you'll excuse me I'll retreat to the Bat Cave to retrieve the secret weapon. Oh please, be my guest. (LAUGHING) I have one for you. Okay. So what is green, (LAUGHING) green, wet, and smells like pig? MARVIN: Uh, uh, uh, just a big green slimy pig. No, Kermit the Frog's fingers. - (LAUGHING) - Oh! All the fingers? Oh man! Jesus Christ! Oh my god, Miss Piggy. That's a good one. That reminds me of one I, you know, you can tell who your best friend is, you know, by if you take your dog and your wife and you stick 'em in the trunk of your car for about a couple hours, you let 'em out, you'll find out who your best friend is. JACKIE: Oh! (LAUGHING) What do you call an Ethiopian with a yeast infection? No fucking clue. MARVIN: Quarter pounder with cheese. - No way! - Eew! You did not just say that! MARVIN: You're gonna have to calm me down this time, I'm not gonna do it. (LAUGHING) I'm not gonna do it. Oh no, no! - Oh man. - You're bad. MARVIN: To the bone, bad to the bone. You're really, oh shit, I'm out. - Oh, me too. - It's all gone. So we're gonna do this again and I'm gonna come armed with better joke material. Well that sounds great, you know, we'll have a joke off. Okay. But next time we gotta have Trent here. Trent. (LAUGHING) What the fuck? JACKIE: Hello, is anyone home? Trent, you screening your calls? Jesus, I wish you'd get a cell phone. So I just got in from New York and I wanted to see you but I was calling to tell you that I'm on my way over and I have a surprise for you. (PHONE RINGING) AUTOMATED VOICE: Please leave a message. (BEEPS) Hey babe, I just got your message. Sorry I was out studying. Anyway, looks like you had a pretty good time over here. (LAUGHS) Can see you met my new house guest. Hope he didn't scare you too bad. Anyway, um, I'd love to see you. See what kind of surprise you have for me. Um, let's maybe have lunch tomorrow. Anyway, give me a call when you get this and we'll figure it out. Okay, bye. Where were you yesterday afternoon? I was out studying. Oh, hey that's a coincidence, I was studying too. You know what I was studying? I was studying your fiancee's sweet ass. Oh my god! Oh that girl is fine. Mm, mm, mm. Hey. Hey, you don't mind if I take her out for a test drive, do ya? You know what they say, use it or lose it, right? Hey, hey, you know what? I can keep her tuned up for ya, how about that? Huh? Stuck up motherfucker. (MELLOW MUSIC) What you having today, pal? MARVIN: Shot of whiskey and a beer, chaser. Mm, alright. I can't be any more explicit right now. JOE: Explicit, what the hell does that mean? To like form the stuff that I'm thinking of saying. Until, you know. That's what's known as a generous pour. I'm trying to get the cobwebs out. JOE: That's a good thing, get rid of those. Salud. I'll keep you company for a little while. (LAUGHING) Okay. Yeah, uh... - What's your name? - One more of those. I'm Marvin Decker. Joe, Joe Pitcock. Or like James Bond. Remember James Bond he used to say Bond, James Bond? MARVIN: Right right right right. So I'm trying to be cool and now I'm gonna say Pitcock, Joe Pitcock. (LAUGHING) That's kind of a cool name. Nice to meet you Joe, you know I like, I always like to know the name of the man who's serving me drinks. Back, give it back. Just gotta get up to there. Give it back, give it back. Okay cowboy. So what's your story? Is it always this slow? JOE: Oh it picks up after a while, you know, people start coming in. Kinda lonely right now, that's the way it starts out usually. Yeah. - Drink up buddy. - Yeah man. (LAUGHING) What's the deal with Marvin? (CLEARS THROAT) Well. He's staying with me for a few days. Yeah I know, but why? You're not really the kind of guy who invites random strangers to live with them. Yeah it wasn't really my idea, he was kind of forced on me. How was he forced on you? Um, I'm doing my landlord a favor. Marvin is his father in law. Mm. So why is he staying with you and not your landlord? I am really not sure to be honest. (LAUGHING) Well he's a very interesting man. Did you know that he was thrown overboard in a storm and he was floating in the ocean for six days before they found him? Yeah, he told me that. But there's no way. What do you mean there's no way? I mean there's no way that he could have survived for six days in the ocean on a life vest. He didn't have water. You can't live for six days without water. How do you know he had no water? (LAUGHING) Hmm? Because there's no water on a life vest, okay? Maybe on a raft. Not on a life vest. I know there's no water on a fucking vest. You don't have to talk to me like I'm a child. What I wanna know is how you know that he had no water. No, but... You assumed and in the process you decided he's a liar and that I'm stupid for believing him. I don't know that it's like that. It's just, it's deductive reasoning. So you deducted that he's a liar and I'm stupid, right? I wouldn't... No, I mean, I wouldn't put it like that. He tells these fanciful stories and then when you look at the facts, it doesn't add up. JACKIE: Hmm. Why are you defending him, anyway? I'm defending him because I had a wonderful time with him the other day. I mean, he's charming, he's handsome, he's well-spoken. He told me he knew how to salsa, he was actually really good. He speaks five languages. - Yeah, alright, okay... - Fluently, don't, don't fuckin' interrupt me. I'm talking. Ugh. I'm a little drunk, I... I'm gonna go home. Wait wait wait wait, where are you going? Don't you think you're overreacting a little? I'm going home. There are things I need to think about. Wait! Please. (PENSIVE MUSIC) - She's an amazing artist. - Excuse me? Oh, I was saying she's an amazing artist. Oh, oh, I wouldn't know. Um, I have a friend who's a photographer so I was just looking for books for her. Oh, I see, I see. You know, you look very familiar. I think I've seen you before. My name's Paul Oakley. Trent Harris. Yeah, I know where I know you from. You work the night desk at the Ambassador, right? I go there with friends from time to time to go to the lounge. Oh, right, right. Right, well I kinda gotta get going. It was really nice to meet you. Paul. Trent, right? Yes. Yes. Well it was nice meeting you. I'm sure I'll see you around. Well what are you doing now? Um, I just, I have to meet a friend in a little bit. There's a wine bar right around the corner, a place I wanna try. Do you like wine? Uh yeah, yeah, yeah, I like wine. Great, why don't you join me? If you have time. Um... Um, sure, sure. (LAUGHING) Sure, I can't stay all that long. Great, we'll just drop in and check the place out, be spontaneous. - Sound fun? - Yeah. - Great. - That sounds good. Great. Aren't you gonna get the book? No, um, no. I'll come back and grab it later. Oh. Let's try some... Excuse me, what? Oh, really? Hold on a second. Mm. (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Oh yeah. (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) And you. Tell me about you. What about your parents, they from here? Sorry, I didn't mean to bring up a sore subject. My parents were killed in a car wreck after I got out of school. Jesus. I'm so sorry. That's horrible. It's okay. How could you know? My dad was a pastor. And my mom was a housewife. And they were out on one of their few dinner dates. And a drunk driver ran into them. Killed instantly. (LAUGHS) I'm sorry. I'm sorry, you don't wanna hear this. Actually, I do. (CLEARS THROAT) I better get going. You aren't gonna finish your wine? No, no, I think I've had enough. Um, I've stayed longer than I expected to and I have an appointment I'm gonna be late for so if you'll excuse me. I understand. No no no no, I've got it. Oh I can't let you do that. No no no no, it's not a problem. You can get the next one. (LAUGHS) Okay. I got the next one. Great, it's a date. Um, I guess I'll see you around. I'll stop by the hotel sometime. I go there with friends and hang out. Cool, that sounds great. Um, see ya later. (PENSIVE MUSIC) MARVIN: So you're a Jesus freak. PAUL: I understand. It's a date. (KNOCKS) Marvin? You in there? (KNOCKS) (JAZZY MUSIC) What do you got there? MARVIN: My daughter. Oh. - That's your girl? - Yeah. What's she like 25, 22? She's like that right now but there she was about probably 10 or 11. You really love her, don't you? (SIGHS) I haven't seen her, I haven't seen her. You know, I had a little girl myself and... It was an accident. JOE: When's the last time you saw her? It was a fuckin' accident. I dunno, few years. Who's counting? JOE: I'm counting, I'm asking you, when was the last time you saw her? I think like three years. JOE: Okay. (TENSE MUSIC) (SHOUTING) (BANGING) (DIALING PHONE) (PHONE RINGING) (BEEPS) WOMAN: Hello, you have reached Morris Property Management. We will be out of town for a much-needed vacation. If this is concerning an apartment you can call 555-7538 or leave a message, thank you. (BEEPS) Fuck you! (DOOR SHUTS) So, um... Guess who I saw today? I'm wondering, did you guys split up? 'Cause she was with this guy and, um, (LAUGHS) let's just say that they weren't acting like they were just friends, you know? (LAUGHS) If you know what I mean. (BANGING) Um, black coffee with room, please.

So what are you guys, where are you going for your honeymoon? TRENT: Costa Rica. Wow, that's great, I love Costa Rica. Where, what city? Mm, we're gonna go all over. I wanna use this as a way to get new material for the show I'm doing when I get back. I lived there in the '70s. It was amazing. That was quite a while back. It's amazing how time flies. (THUNDER RUMBLING) Big storm coming. Hold on just a second, I wanna get you something. Okay, what's wrong with you? Why are you acting so strange? He's not acting normal. What does that mean? I don't know. He's not usually this polite. He usually is with me. Maybe you get on his nerves or something. Oh I get on his nerves? He's living in my fucking apartment! Okay. I found this stone in Costa Rica. I don't remember exactly where. I was traveling up the coast. Surfing and camping out. Hiding out, really. I was in this really bad spot in my life. (RAIN PATTERING) I had just lost my wife and in some sense I guess I was trying to kill myself. Anyway, yeah well I had a geologist friend of mine check it out. He told me that there's only one place in the world that has stone of that nature. Ethiopia. So, so what's the point? Why are you telling us all this? Well the point is I'm giving it to Jackie. JACKIE: Why? Well that stone has given me a lot of good luck. And it's time to pass it on. And you, you know, you remind me of my wife. That same zest for life. That same spark. (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Oh god that's really sweet but I can't take it. It's your lucky stone. Oh no, you have no choice. It's my wedding gift to you. Wow, that's... That's the sweetest gift anyone has ever given me. So sweet. Now if you will excuse me, I have to use the restroom. (CLATTERS) Be careful, be careful. You're so fuckin' full of shit.

I'm gonna go soak in the tub, I'm chilled to the bone. Hey Trent. You look cleaner. McNoughten, nice. So what are you celebrating, you finally found a home that'd take you? (LAUGHING) That was a good one. Yeah, yeah, grab a glass and I'll tell you. TRENT: Oh no no, that's alright. Oh come on. What's the matter wise-ass, you don't like scotch? Actually, I really enjoy scotch. Well then grab a glass. We're celebrating. Okay. I wanna apologize for the way I've treated you. Cheers. (GLASSES CLINK) November 12, 1972. - Okay. - Ah. TRENT: So what's that, the end of the Vietnam War? No, that's the day I killed my wife. You killed your wife? In a manner of speaking, yeah. I was drunk and high and ran the car off the road. She was thrown from it and killed instantly. Jesus. How horrible. It was. She was a perfect light. I've never found another like her. Mr. Morris mentioned that you were his father in law so that would mean that you have a daughter. Yeah, Katie. She was with the sitter that night. TRENT: And you and her don't get along? Not really. After Abby died, I went into this really, really dark place. And I wasn't fit to be a father and I put her up for adoption. She was 10. We got together a couple years ago, we reunited and she still hasn't forgiven me for abandoning her and killing her mother and I can't say that I blame her. (CLEARS THROAT) That's a pretty awful thing to go through at 10 years old. Horrible thing to go through at any age. Yeah you're right. Jackie reminds me a lot of Abby. She's got that same zest for life, you know? So every year since 1972 you drink a bottle of scotch in her memory? Yeah. But, you know, I'm almost always with somebody else, and this year it's you. Cheers. (GLASSES CLINK) - To new wives. - And lost loves. So there's this old maid. She wants to travel by bus to the pet cemetery with the remains of her cat. She gets up on the bus and she says to the driver, "I've got a dead pussy." The driver looks at her, points to the seat behind him and says, "Why don't you sit down there with my wife, "you got a lot in common." (FUNKY MUSIC) So. (GLASSES CLINK) Come on, get up. Okay, like this, right at the end, right? Then. (LAUGHING) (GLASSES CLINKING) (SHOUTS) Yeah, yeah I got my bag of tricks right here. No no no, I don't know any. Oh come on, you gotta know one. TRENT: No, I mean I really don't. Oh, don't be such a pussy, come on. Okay. It's not very good. I don't care, just tell me a joke. - Okay. - Alright. (LAUGHING) So the pope is making his way down the line and he stops and he leans over and he says, "I told you yesterday to get the fuck outta here." (LAUGHING) Not that (MUMBLING). - Oh yeah. - With all them boyos coming up. Whoa. Whoa, holy shit. I gotta go to bed, I gotta go to bed, class in the morning. Hey, I had a good time tonight. Thanks man. MARVIN: Hey, you're welcome. You're a good guy, Trent. - Yeah. - You're alright. (BREATHING HEAVILY) (TENSE MUSIC) JACKIE: What would it hurt? Who would know? MARVIN: I could keep her tuned up. This one taken? WOMAN: You're never gonna get married. (HORNS HONKING) (CRASHING) (SNORING) What the fuck? What the fuck? I'm sorry. Trent, what the fuck are you doing in my bed? I'm sorry, it was an accident. I'm sorry, it was an accident. What do you mean it was an accident, you fuckin' fag? Don't call me that. Well then tell me how it was an accident you were in my bed. I have these dreams sometimes and I just wake up... Dreams? You twisted fuck. You were jacking off. No, no, it's not like that. You were jacking off in my bed. No, no! No that's not it. No, you were jacking off, weren't you? You're a sick queer-ass motherfucker and I knew it all along I knew that the only way you could be with her and not be fuckin' her is if you were a fag. Right? Huh? Don't call me that, I'm not a fag. Yeah you are, you're a fag, you're a fag. I'm gonna beat your fuckin' little faggot ass and then I'm gonna call your girl and tell her you were beating it in my bed, okay? What do you think she's gonna think of that, huh? What do you think? Ah, forget that, I'm not gonna have to beat you. I'm gonna tell Jackie that you were jacking off in my bed while I was asleep. I'm sure she's gonna wanna know why. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (HITS) You motherfucker! Son of a bitch, I'm gonna fucking kill you! Fuck! Shut up! You motherfucker! You never fucking use an ashtray! You never fucking clean up after yourself! You never fucking flush the fucking toilet! (SOBBING) Why can't you just be nice? (BREATHING RAGGEDLY) (WHIMPERING) Oh Jesus, what did I do? Oh my god. (TENSE MUSIC) (BREATHING HEAVILY) (CRYING) (GROANING) (BEEPS) JACKIE: Hi honey. I know you're there. Did you take the rings? I'm taking the plane, see you tomorrow, I'm so excited. So excited. (BEEPS) Hey, honey, I haven't received any answer from you. What's wrong? Call me. (BEEPS) Trent, I've called you for four days and I have no answer. Are you regretting about the wedding? (LAUGHS) What's going on? Call me. (TENSE MUSIC) (BEEPS) I'm on my way home so we need to talk. You know what the best thing about fucking 25 year olds is? No, I don't know. There's 20 of 'em. JACKIE: Trent? Trent. (KNOCKING) I just wanna talk to you. Trent, you in there? Baby, I just wanna hear your voice. I don't know why you won't talk to me. Trent. (KNOCKING) Trent! DETECTIVE CALLAHAN: Trent, this is Detective Callahan. Listen, I just need to talk to you for a minute so if you could open the door, that would be great. (SIRENS WAILING) (KNOCKING) Trent, we know you're in there, you just looked out the window. (GAS HISSING) Gonna have to go in. Okay, we need to get everyone out of here. JACKIE: Trent.
