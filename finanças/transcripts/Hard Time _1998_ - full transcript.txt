[Man] Down here in paradise, the wind can be soft and sweet and sometimes wicked. It giveth, and it taketh away. There should be a billboard on the state line that says, "Begin removing your clothes and your inhibitions now." It's like a third world country full of many languages. Everything and everybody runs down here to paradise. Down here, because you see, we are at the bottom of the nation. It's a land of beautiful people. Also retirees and mermaids and fugitives and tourists, crazies, criminals, and of course...cops. [Man, singsong] One and two and step on a crack, and break your mother's back. Charlie, what the hell are you doing? The trouble with you is you was never a kid. The trouble with you is you're a hundred pounds overweight. And your 70-year-old carc-ass is going to go right through the ceiling. In the first place, I'm 59. And I am full figured. And you're cranky. I'm not cranky. We've been up all night watching paint dry. Well, the fresh white wall is how we lure the wolf into our trap. I can't believe that I'm on graffiti patrol. You think it's easy to get on graffiti patrol? If I hadn't pulled a string, we'd still be playing cops and robbers. Show some appreciation. And would you take a look at this, would you? The Wolf is the Picasso of the streets. Did you know that the airbrush has taken the place of the paintbrush? I don't care. Well, once you learn that it's not graffiti, you'll appreciate it as art. Wolf. That's his tag. Yip. This wall is like cheese to a rat. Ha ha ha! [phone rings] [ring] ¿Qué? ¿Qué? [speaking Spanish] [man whining] [Man] Shut up. [second man] Shut up. Hey, just nervous. It's okay. How about a little show and tell action? [speaking Spanish] How about show some of the stuff that he got? What do you think, huh? I just want to see some stuff. Here's some stuff, okay? That's what I want to see. That's what I'm talking-- How about some right now? Can we do some right now? No, first we do the do. Oh, we're gonna do the do, huh? Glad I ain't carrying this bag. A man could get ideas, huh? The idea is not to get ideas. I was just thinking out loud, Mister. So am I. [Women speaking in Spanish] This-- That book's the keys to the kingdom. All that graphs and science stuff. It's not how much you eat, it's what food you put together. No meat or proteins with your starches. And no fruits with your vegetables. It's all about combinations. [wrapper crinkling] What the hell are you doing? What? I ain't gonna combine this with nothing. Looks like a candy bar, doesn't it? I bought it down at the health food store. High energy. I need that. Look now. Look. [Charlie] 8:45 in the a.m., and already my shirt is sticking to my ass. Huh. Something's going down. Call for backup. What do you mean call for backup? Call for backup. I've got a hunch. The last time you had a hunch, I got shot. Call it in, Charlie. We're on graffiti patrol! [scoffs] I'm staying here. I don't care. What's he looking at? He's got a hunch. He's got a hunch. God, he's right. One Charlie Deuce. We've got a snatch and grab. Three male Latino suspects on foot. Harrison, south of 3rd. Also need backup. This is One Brady Seven. We're four blocks away. Police! Hold it! [horn, tires squealing] [Men speaking Spanish] Be cool. Keep going. [police radio chatter] Is he coming? [siren] Graffiti police. Sorry. Graffiti police. [siren] Hey, did you see that mess in there? What do you say we sit this one out and wait for the gunshots? Call in our 20! I don't like alleys. There are too many corners, dead ends. Call it in, Charlie! "Call it in, Charlie." Why don't you wait for your new partner to play cowboy? One Charlie Deuce, we are in a sector known as "Robert." We have initiated a foot pursuit. Or at least my partner has! Go. You go. Go. Charlie! What? That way! Oh, I'll never catch up. Geez! [yelling in Spanish] Police! Get against the wall and spread 'em! Man, why are we running from this old man here? [speaking Spanish] Up against the wall, kid. Do it. Are you deaf? No entiendo. ¿No entiendo? No. No entiendo. Ah. Ohh! A broken nose is better than a broken life. ¿Entiendo? Huh? Yes, yes, yes. I speak English. Right. Estás loco! Te voy a matar! Yeah! I am crazy. What are you doing, man? You can't shoot a cop. I want to. You're crazy. Ahh. [dog barking] [groaning] Oh, ohh! Where this case goes, I'm going. [groaning] I think it's broken, man. [gunshot] Daryl, you go that way. It's not over, Milk Eye! [Man over radio] Uh, Dispatch One Adam 17, ETA two minutes. [police radio chatter] Looks like the road's blocked. [laughs] Yeah. Ahem. Uh-- Excuse me, sir. Hey. Hey. I'm a golden oldie. [Woman on radio] One Adam 17, give me an exact location when you get there. "Robert" sector, 20th Avenue. We're sending paramedics now. [Man over radio] Uh, roger that, dispatch. This is One Adam 17. Captain on scene. Request has been made. 11-35. Request has been made. [Irish brogue] Top of the morning to you, Captain. And where have you been? Chasing my tail. You didn't see any of this? He's fast. Since when do partners split up? Since my fat ass collapsed, Captain, darling. And where have you been? Why'd you leave the scene? Well, there were two perps. One is dead. The other one had a weapon. Ran away. I chose to go after the one that was alive and had the weapon, Captain. Charlie. I thought you guys were on graffiti patrol. [Charlie] We were. And it's not graffiti, it's art. [laughs] ** [piano] [general chatter] So what kind of a mood do we be in this evening? [sighs] A shooter. Ew, you be in a blue mood. Refreshing. Hey, Trumpet. What a day. Give me a tiny triple. How you doing, partner? Come on. You didn't kill that kid. Hey, you don't want my company? Fine. Now, he was a scumbag. Sir, one of your finer sensibilities has always been allowing your underlings to spread their wings. Is this your subtle way of asking whether you can be let in on a Logan case? Well, let's see. The physical evidence is inconclusive. No confessions, no witnesses. Hey, I love it. Counselor, when I was a cop, I found that people were more afraid of cops than crooks. Sir, people get the police they deserve. They deserve better. Now, I've seen the coroner's report. It fits the story we're going to tell of a time bomb in blue. With all due respect, sir, it's just that I don't think that the excessive force by itself is going to play in Logan's case. I mean, it's become cliché. Do you have a better idea? [Sports Announcer] It is gonna hit home. It's a live ball, belongs to it, over the fence. Wow, what a big play. Holy Toledo. A huge break. What happened to the combination diet? What's a better combination than beer and whiskey? Hey, hey. Oh, hey, how you doing? Sorry, I didn't hear you knock. What's the score? [Logan] No score. Two fumbles. I got the over. Want a beer, Adam? No, thanks. What...is this? Uh, Logan's a painter. Painting what? What's it bring to mind? Nothing. Well, see, that's what he had in mind. Did you come over here to be an art critic? This is very confusing. [laughs] Mr. Barker's out to clean up the department. Again? [all chuckle] I know ya'll find it very amusing, but-- But? I think he's gunning for you. For what? How'd you get Pepe's blood on your sleeves? I was feeling for his pulse. That makes sense. Paraffin test came back. No powder or soot on Pepe's hands. Pepe never had a gun. You know, maybe Logan shot him when he returned fire. Thanks. Then he's got a long arm because the coroner's saying the kid was shot from less than 3 feet. It had to be Milk Eye. Right. Milk Eye. I heard a shot. On the way over there. It had to be Milk Eye. Logan, it'd be nice if we could find the gun that matches the other casings at the scene. Where are you going with this, Adam? You should think about changing your story. Hey, I ain't married to my story. You're his partner. Who's gonna believe you? They don't have a case. Logan, how many times has the Complaint Board spanked you for being a bad-ass cop? He's been decorated five times. Spanked six. Oh, it's not a bad record for 25 years. Hey, he could take a polygraph. Thanks. It's inadmissible. Well, it still lessens the doubt. I think I will have a beer. We gotta talk about this. [Logan] Sounds like Hertz is going to pin me with Pepe. Hey, no gun, no Milk Eye, no case. Charlie, Hertz is looking for headlines. I've got to find Milk Eye. We'll start in Little Havana. ** [salsa] [whistling] [whistles] Charlie! We're working! [scoffs] Good Lord, Leo, you and I walked a beat together. I thought you were going to be the D.A. that us cops could call a brother-in-arms. Oh, Charlie, it hasn't changed. But cops have to be accountable. Equal law for all. That's how we put it 30 years ago. I know Logan like I know my priest. And no way he's a shooter. You know you know what? Character. Look the word up. Buy a dictionary, if you can read. Easy, Charlie. Yeah, easy, Charlie. My friends call me Charlie. You're worse than a pup. You're something I scrape off my shoe. Charlie, uh, McQueen is highly decorated, but you and I both know-- [chuckling]-- the man is a loose canon. As I recall, your statement indicates that you weren't even present at the time of the shooting, is that correct? Leo, the kid had a broken ankle. Why would Logan shoot somebody who couldn't even walk? Oh, come on. A certain opportunity presents itself, a certain person has to go. Who cares about a cockroach? I thought you said this guy was smart. Is that the best you can come up with? That's pretty light. Is it? I'm smart enough to know that when nobody's watching, we all have our moments. Now, you think about that, Detective Duffy. You get that finger out of my face, or I'll stick it where your mama takes your temperature. Good idea. [Adam] Mr. Barker's out to clean up the department. Ohh! [Logan] I didn't kill the kid. [Adam] Problem is Barker thinks you did. [Charlie] They got no case. It's circumstantial. But it's election year. Hertz doesn't care about a trial. Hey! Maybe Logan shot him, and he returned fire. Then he's got a long arm because the coroner's saying the kid was shot from less than 3 feet. I think he's gunning for ya. You have the right to an attorney, to have an attorney present. Get off it. What do you think you're gonna do with those? Put away the handcuffs, Higgs. You don't need 'em. Logan, I'm gonna need your shield. Higgs, he knows the way. No way they make that case. Ray Hertz ain't the dullest knife in the drawer. ** [flamenco] Compañero. How are you? I was counting on being a half a million dollars richer. I'm sorry. [laughs] I still expect to be paid. So, you said over the telephone you wanted to whisper something in my ear. Well, I just found out there's 310 grand in the bag. According to my arithmetic, that's $190,000 light. [laughs] Who...do you think? Who do I think or what do I think? [laughs] You tell me. Hi. I'll have a hamburger, well done. Cute. Any news on the two whiz kids? Nothing. Pepe must have been hanging around with them. Pepe is a dead end. No names? Uh, somebody called with a couple gang names. You know, Chu Chu, Catarato. Catarato. Milk Eye. That's something. Listen. I need you out of here. Yeah. That hamburger done? You don't need anymore hamburgers. [laughs] ** [funk] [dogs barking, people speaking Spanish] Speedy Pizza! Hi. Bang-bang, compañero. [laughs] [Man] McQueen, your lawyer's here. [sighs] So long, Ron. Good luck, Logan. They could have knocked me down when I got the call from Charlie. I didn't think I could afford you. Charlie passed a hat. Oh. How's it feel being on the other side of the law? I'm not on the other side of the law. Don't get me mixed up with those lowlifes you get off all the time. [scoffs] I don't like cops. Nobody does until they need one. You weren't my idea. It was Duffy's. Okay, I'll tell Charlie to give the money back. Whoa, whoa. Sorry. Please. Did you kill him? I didn't think you guys asked that question. I am not a guy, and I'm asking. No. Did you kill him? Those things on the side of your head-- that hold up your earrings-- do they work? Okay. I believe you. I don't think they have a case. Obviously, somebody disagrees with you. There's one thing. I call the shots. What I say goes. I am your judge and jury. I decide. Have you got that? A benevolent dictator. It's the perfect form of government. I love beating men at their own game. Especially prosecutors. Let's see about getting you out of here. Bail set at 500,000. Next case. [Bailiff] Case number 7294-- the state versus Baranski. See you in court. You know he passed the lie detector test. So what? Bad? Bad. What if you can't make bail? They move you to a cell... until you go to trial. Maybe they'll make us roommates. [shouting, groaning] Hold! Chu Chu. [coughing] Yeah? Once the bond of trust is broken, it's very difficult to show mercy! I don't happen to have your money, Mr. Martin. I swear! We got split up. The cops started chasing us. God, I think my head's gonna fall off. [coughing] Where's Catarato? No sé, no sé. I don't know! Chu Chu... ¿dónde esta Catarato? I'm telling the truth. I swear I don't know. [Man] I don't believe him. That's the problem. I do. Hey, McQueen. You made bail. Dave? I'm Ron. Oh, Ron. That's all right. I'm happy for you anyway. [laughs] I'm gonna be here a while. How about that light? Oh, yeah. Keep 'em. Uno momento. Just cool it. Okay, listen. Are you telling me I have to put the original carburetor and the air filter back in the car before I can get a safety inspection? [scoffs] I threw the other part away. 'Cause it wasn't working. They don't make the originals no more! Buddy, you can tell your buddies down at the DMV they can kiss my cherubic buns because I won't-- Lord have mercy! Look at you! Give me some sugar! [both laughing] Logan, you look good. Oh, woof. The lady is dangerous. [laughs] These are hard times. I been praying for you at church. Been kneeling a little myself. Get on over there. Do your business. Yes, ma'am. Mmm-mm. Check it out. Boy's still got back. [laughs] Did Charlie put up the whole 50? Mmm, who knows anything around here? [phone rings] Here you go. [ring] You don't have to fill any more of that crap out. Don't you want to know where I'm staying? You ain't going nowhere, baby. [Men shouting in Spanish, cocks crowing] Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey! [speaking Spanish] Come on. Assume the-- Assume-- Turn around. Hello, Lalo. You're due in court in 15 days. How'd you like me to help you? [speaks Spanish] What do you want? I'm looking for a last name for a Catarato. Hey man, there's a lot of Cataratos around here, man. Catarato Escobar, Catarato Castro, Catarato Catarato. [laughter] Ai, aii. I'm just looking for one man. Yeah, but he uses many names. How many got a milk eye? Ai. Huh, huh? I don't hear that. It's Catarato Estevez. What? Catarato Estevez! Catarato Estevez? Oh, thank you very much. I want you to bump any case you can to get Logan on the docket. Myler's one hell of an attorney, but she can be a witch, and you can substitute a "b" there. I'm certain you can hold your own. You know, I realize there are certain people who wonder why you want to try this case before the election, but, like I said, look at the polls. Logan's serving a purpose. This is not about the election, Hertz. It's about law and order. [laughs] Thanks. Nice evening. So far. Get in. Since you asked so sweetly. Oh, buenas noches, Sergeant. Bienvenidos. Well I was waiting for a bigger car. A bigger car? Godzilla! Very funny. [laughs] Would you like a big drink? Well, only if the pretty guy here is the waiter. [laughs] A cop with a feel for comedy. How amusing. I guess you know who I am. Oh, I know who you are, Mr. Martin. I busted you a while back for running a horse parlor. That you did. You certainly did. That was a long time ago. Well, not so long ago. 15 years. You've risen to the head of the class. This country's been good to me. I got no complaints. What's on your mind? I've got a lot on my mind. But I know that you're a man in a hurry. You want me to be laconic and get to the point, huh? I have no charm. Besides, you have enough charm for both of us. Only when it hurts. Where's my money? Excuse me? I'm your patron. Patron? Yeah, how the hell do you think that you made bail? You think Christmas came early this year? A half a million dollars was in that bag when it left my hands. And only 310,000 was counted out by your own forensic officers. What's that got to do with me? You were the officer at the scene. That's what it has to do with you. Well, I was a police officer, a bag man, Chu Chu and Catarato. That's true. But you're the only bird that we have in hand. [laughter] I would like to treat you with the respect and the dignity that you deserve, but-- So when my boys start asking you "Where's the money?" I suggest that you answer them quickly and honestly, hmm? Well, then we have a problem 'cause I don't like it when anybody touches me, puts their hands on me or my bird. Pull over. Have a beautiful evening. [Logan] You got lead in there? Yeah, I do. That's gonna slow your hand speed down, isn't it? Maybe not. [groaning] [Men groaning] [cowboys shouting, horses neighing on TV] [soft knocking] Charlie. Oh. What happened? [gunshot] [heartbeat] [tires squealing] Where's my money? Half a million dollars was in that bag when it left my hands. And only $310,000 was counted up by your own forensic officers. [grunting] There was a police officer, a bag man, Chu Chu and Catarato. Where's my money? [gunshot] [seagulls squawking] Disoriented? Yeah. This couldn't be your place. It's too feminine. You have two cracked ribs. Would you like to try for three? You must have walked three, four miles before you fainted at Charlie's door. And that wasn't very "macho" of you. Yeah, it wasn't. Did Charlie bring me here? No, I did. We thought you'd be safer here. I didn't think he brought me here. I mean, he couldn't have known about all these... these pillows. I mean, why do women always have these little pillows? They're useless. They're nice to look at, but useless. Relatable symbolism for you, I assume. The last guy who slept here, it's been the last guy who slept here. That's cute. Hey, Lefty. Boy, you look so sweet. How's my Rose of Tralee? What do you want now? You posted a bail bond on a guy with a milk eye. Nicknamed Catarato. Tito Estevez. I want to see his file. Oh, our files are sacred, honey. Just like the one you took from the precinct. How much? Why would I give you the file? Logan needs it. How come? If he wanted me to know, I'd tell you. Cute. You know the best ten years of an Irishman's life? 3rd grade? [laughs] One of these days I'll find one you don't know. Oh, you're lucky. This is your lucky day. He owes me some money. [phone ringing] I love you, Mama. You just oughta. Close that door behind you! You were quite an athlete. Excuse me? At Charlie's place, when I went to help him out-- He's got a shrine to your football, boxing, track. Oh. I wore a few sweaters. Do you have any family? Just Charlie. No, I mean birth family. The men I know love to talk about themselves. Oh, really? Oh... bounced around. You were a runaway? No. My father was a runaway. I was only five years old. But I could tell he wasn't coming back. I ran after him, I tackled him. Punched me in the nose. My mother was never quite the same after that. And then I went from foster home to foster home. Where does Charlie come in? Charlie kind of plucked me up when I was about 16. Talked to the coaches. They gave me a second chance. I figured it out. Football hero sometimes gets the girl. He listens to everything I say. He even listens when I haven't got anything to say. He listens all the time. And if your birth father showed up? I'd punch him in the nose, go back to Charlie. What are you gonna do when you get too old to punch any noses? Become a shepherd. My brother used to get in a lot of fights. My father took him aside. He explained to him, "You get nothing with this. You get everything with this." Your father wasn't a cop. [laughs] I'll call Charlie. Have him come pick me up. Why? Well, I can't sleep on those dumb pillows again. Oh, that's okay. You can sleep on the couch. ** [humming] Hi, I just let myself in. Hi. Oh, I'm starved. Oh, I fixed this for you. Oh, you shouldn't have. How did you know I was coming? What'd you find out? Well, I think I, uh... I found Catarato's address. How about you? Martin says the bag was light. He thinks you took it. I told him you took it. Want to split it? [laughs] Good morning. Hi. Hi. Um, where's this breakfast you promised me? Oh. You know, 35 years, he never even once dropped a piece of bread in a toaster for me. Oh, marital problems? Oh, yes. Low blood sugar. He's kind of grouchy. You sleep okay? No. You? Best sleep in months. I'm gonna jump in the shower. I'll fix you breakfast. Yeah, I'll make sure he does. Almost as good as mine. Oh, I, um, I got this for ya. Just in case, you know. That way when they hit you, you can shoot back. Oh. Love the flower. Come on. We've got work to do. Who else could have taken Martin's money? A cop in the property room, Catarato, me-- Did Catarato look like he was packing dough? Hell, I don't know. I'm not sure anymore. What about Martin's bag man? Oh, I think he's with his maker. [laughs] Be funny if he did do it. Yeah. You know the only guy that's going to get me off is the shooter. Yeah, Catarato. You got it. Buenas "duez." If you took Martin's money, would you still be in town? Would you? Here it is. Yeah. All right. Seven. [buzzing] What? [cats meowing] I'm Detective McQueen. I'd like to ask you a few questions. You got any ID? Yes, ma'am. Got anything with a picture on it? Yes, ma'am. Oh, I need my glasses. Hold on. Oh. He's got black hair. I know. It's an old-- it's an old picture. That ain't you. No, it is me. No, it ain't you. It is me. I dyed my hair. Why? Why? Why'd you dye it? You look much younger when it was black. Can we come in? How about you, dolly? You a cop, too? Uh, a clairvoyant. [laughs] Well, let me put my cat up. Okay, fellas, this way. Now, watch your step. Now you can meet all my cats. Here they are. Oh, would you fellows hanker for a beer? Uh, no. He's on the wagon and I'm here to lend moral support. What's on your mind? [cats meowing, screeching] Uh, we're looking for an ex-tenant. He was here about a year ago. Apartment four. If he ain't here now, he don't exist. Uh, please? Oh, all right. Let me see now... Oh, yes. Number four's been here nine months. You can't reach back nine months? Well, who'd want to remember? Precious, that cat is dead. I knew that. Maybe the owner kept some records. You're looking at her, honey. At least, since my better half kissed off. Well, we won't waste any more of your time. Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. I got some kind of a notice from the DMV about that unit, oh, a few weeks back. You're looking for a girl, right? Catarato is a girl. You still have the notice? Why would I? Let's go. I'm ready. Are you sure you don't want a beer? No, no, I'm a hard liquor man, myself. Hey, dolly, I got that, too. No, duty calls. Charlie, you can stay if you want to. No, I gotta go. I gotta go. Gotta go! [laughs] Hmm. Been a long day. Crazy people out there. Give me one for the road. Right. Let's help you get caught up. On the tab. There was about 60 candles all over the place. It was beautiful. ** [flamenco] [speaking Spanish] Well, Mr. McQueen. Please, have a chair. Oh, are you an aficionado of flamenco dancing? I was until I found out José Greco was born in Brooklyn. [laughs] Would you care to join me in some paella marlina? I've lost my appetite. Oh. So have they. Because their jaws are broken, eh? [laughs] I should bounce them but I'm too sentimental. Someone tried to kill me last night. Hey, don't look at me. Maybe you should call the police, huh? Or maybe it was the police. Are you telling me that the police are trying to kill me? No. I'm saying that everybody thinks you've got enemies. [laughs] If I had the money, I wouldn't be here. Yes, yes, yes. I see. But what about Catarato? Why can't you find him? I haven't got him yet. But I'll get him. [chuckles] Okay. My boys are out of commission so I guess you're my only hope. [laughs] Come on. Come on! My friend. Please. Yes, yes. [laughs] I just want one more shot at you. Tell him not to talk with his mouth full. Hey, McQueen! Suerte. Ms. Myler. Mr. Hertz. You're in the big leagues, again. I never left. Sort of a turnaround, you defending a cop. Oh, I don't think so. Seeing as sort of crooks and cops are odd couples. Oh, I wish I'd said that. Oh, you will, Mr. Hertz. Maybe for once I'm on the same side as you. Oh, come on. Hear me out. Barker wants this to be the second crucifixion. Now suppose I can whittle him down to a reasonable plea bargain. I'm not saying I can't-- Oh, spare me the soft sell, Mr. Hertz. I've read the ballistics report. None of the casings near the body match Logan's gun. It's almost lewd, you and Barker pushing this into court. Why if I didn't know better, I would accuse you of playing politics. Don't ever say I didn't try and help. When I need your kind of help, I will quit the bar. Logan's going down. We have more money than he does. Maybe. If money can beat brains. Good afternoon, Mr. Hertz. That half performance chip should be in mañana, Logan. Nice to see you, Goober. It's Davie. Oh, that's right. Davie Goober. Thanks for the window, Davie. Yes, sir. Goober smoocher. Why the hell you gotta be so tough on the kid for? Oh, you caught that, huh? Aah, it's chemical. Listen, we got one car that cross-checks with three outstanding parking tickets at the cat lady's address. Got one hot check charged a couple of years ago, and no home phone. Registered to a Nyguen, Nyguan, Nygu-- oh, I can't pronounce it. Asian. Yeah, that's what I said. Ah, old business phone. We've got an address. 2512. I know it. Be right back. I'll be right with you. Okay. May I help you? Um, yeah. I was looking for some carnations or bird of paradise. Funeral? No, no. I was just trying to impress somebody. What would you suggest? A single black orchid. Would that impress you? I better just take the single, black orchid. We don't have any in stock. I'll be back. Don't forget to check the back door and the thermostat. You got that? Yeah, sure. Okay. Good night. Bye. [snoring] [car honking] Where you going? Where you going? Hey! What-- will you talk to me? [dogs barking] ** [Spanish] [whispering] Move. Pervert. Get your own window. It's Catarato. I'm going in. [whispering] Logan! This guy's a two time loser. Wait for backup! Go back to the car and call it in. Hello, Milk Eye. Get dressed. Get up. You took away my gun once. You killed the kid. What you expect? Pepe was a crack head. He slowed me down. He was gonna tell on me. What'd you do with my gun? Got rid of it. Where was the money going? Same place you pick up your check. My precinct? What about the money? I was going to take the money but then I saw that other cop. What cop? There was another cop in the alley besides me? I don't care if you believe it or not. How do you know it was a cop? Give me a break. Logan, they're coming. Backup's on its way. Read him his rights, Charlie. Come on, you know the drill. Read 'em! Young lady, you should know better than to hang around-- Charlie, get out of-- Did you ever see anybody that fast? Did you see him go out that window? I couldn't believe it. Load up, Charlie! Take it easy. That's my car. Shut up! Take it easy! Wait, this is my car! Will you take it, will you take it easy? What, what, what's that? [indistinct dialogue] [siren] Where you going? Where you going? You'd think espresso beans would be stronger than French roast but it's the other way around. What were we talking about? Higgs. Higgs. Um, who knows? On the surface, he's a carbon copy of you. You know, he's been suspended. For what? Excessive force. It seems someone filed a complaint which was a little shady. So Higgs paid the guy a visit and it escalated. Sound familiar. Yeah. Higgs was the first cop on the scene. So? So, how long was it before he called it in? How would I know? There was me and there was Logan. And there was Higgs. And there was me. I was being polite, Captain. Thank you. Check that bag and see if Higgs' prints are on it. You're not intimating he shot Pepe? Captain, there was a lot going on in that alley that day. Just keeping an open mind. Very good. French roast. You buy Milk Eye saw another cop in the alley? Charlie, Catarato's dead. If Higgs is the cop in the alley, then I need him as a witness. This place smells fishy. And so does Higgs. Oh, over there. Look. Yo! Higgs! Sergeant. Who died? Or did you inherit that? It was a drug auction. Yeah, right. Too bad I can't afford one. This a social call or what? It's an "or what." Be right down. Oh. Look at this, will ya? A drug auction? He must have been the only one who knew about the auction. Hi. I'm single. Been expecting you. Is that a fact? Somebody from downtown called me and asked me a bunch of dumb questions. What do you remember about the alley? I put it behind me. How come? It never made sense. How long was it between the time you heard the shots and found Pepe? I didn't look at my watch. Uh, maybe five minutes? You sure? Why do I have to be sure? Just long enough. What's that supposed to mean? Don't be so defensive. [laughs] Look who's talking. You just saw Pepe, nobody else? I would say Pepe focused my mind. What about the bag? What about it? Did you pick it up? Why would I? I know better than to mess with a crime scene. What are you so touchy about? Why are you here? Don't you know? I've got a secret yen for you. Did you know that there was money missing from that bag? The money belonged to Martin. Connie Martin? Connie Martin. And he says it was stolen by a cop. Yeah, like an arrogant cop. Thinks everybody else is stupid. It's a sign of youth. Better get your partner out of here before I kick his ass. You better bring your lunch. Charlie, you mind taking a walk? Yes, I would. Well, do it anyway. Charlie's like a candle, that's about burned right down to the end. Well, it won't happen to me. Yeah. You got a boat. I wouldn't get too comfy in that chair. I think it fits rather well. Yeah, it looks like we're going to be around for a while. Ready to drop the charges? Oh, that was yesterday. Uh, you're drooling. [laughs] The only other bullet casings matched this gun. Which turned up in a dumpster a few blocks away from the crime scene. Please. Now, the surprise is that we come to find out that the gun is registered to you. You see, Ms. Myler, it is in fact true that cops and crooks make odd couples. You lied to me. I didn't kill that kid. Counselor, I would like a moment with my client, please. Not in my office. Your office? Counselor, Officer McQueen. Please be seated. Do you want your client present for this? I'd like to hear everything you have to say. Is this your gun, Officer McQueen? Don't answer that. Yes, sir. Shut up. And these? Yes, sir. [whispers] Logan, please. Ms. Myler, I think we had a case before this gun was turned in. And now our case isn't any worse because of it. Sir, I had the perps cornered. Took my eye off Catarato for a moment. He blindsided me. And, uh, he took my gun. Sorry, I didn't hear that. He took my gun. I had a backup. I had another glock. Ankle holster. Are we supposed to believe that super cop lost his gun and his handcuffs, too? I had-- I have a hard time admitting that. I have stepped over the line a few times. More than a few times. Know what? No matter what kind of spin Ms. Myler puts on this, I will be forced to own up to a crime that I did not commit. I will be forced to say I was a bad cop. Please don't take my badge. If someone was in the alley, then he's got to be connected to the money in the bag. If that's true, you better find him quick because I think Barker's going to go for the full boat. Hmm. What do you think? Well, I'll chase the money. And...at the end of the chase? I haven't decided. You're out of time. When news of your gun hits the press, Hertz is not going to let Barker sit on that for more than a sunset. I thought maybe you could stall them for a day or two. Plea bargain or whatever. Maybe it'll help me. If not, I'll do whatever you decide. I know you will. I'm surprised you didn't go over the table after Hertz. So am I. I tried to do it... your father's way. Good luck. [Man] Come on, Darrell, you work here too. [Man #2] Get another car up here. Give me one second. Got to get this one back on the road. That's okay, you're doing me the favor. Someone tried to kill me last night. Maybe you should call the police, huh? Or maybe it was the police. [gunshot] Well, you'd think these guys would take better care of my cars. So, Logan, you been doing some of that secret police stuff? Logan? That was quick. Yeah. Hold it. I know that look. What's going on? Do me a favor. I want you to go back to forensics. See if they have any smudged prints on that bag of Catarato. Oh, come on. Catarato wastes Pepe, grabs 190 grand, shoves it down his fly, and then vaults a nine-foot fence? Just do it, pal. El Capitan. Hey hey. How'd it go at the DA's? Complicated. However, I got a fresh lead. That's a relief. Yeah. I got an anonymous phone call. They want to meet me tonight. At Charlie's place. They said they know who the money is going to. Also, I'm meeting Catarato's sister. I understand she's very attractive. I wouldn't know. I'm a happily married man. So was I, a couple of times. You sound a little hostile. No. I'm feeling real friendly. I'll let you know how it turns out. If you got any dates tonight, boys, cancel them. If you're the kind of man I think you are, you'll be here. [clearing throat] [doorknob rattles] ** [humming] Phew. [crash] [grunts] Damn. What are you doing here? I live here. I know. You're supposed to be running some errands for me. I thought you were checking on some prints. Yeah, yeah, then I got thinking, you're up to something. I am. That I can believe. You want a beer? Yeah. [bottles clink] The other night, somebody tried to whack me. I got a shot off. Today, guess whose car had a hole through the license plate? I'm tired of guessing. It was our dear Captain Gunther. Yeah. Catarato was Gunther's snitch. Says who? I figure Gunther told him to watch his bag man. And then Catarato decided to go into business for himself. Sounds like the... the novice outwits the master. Well, almost. Gunther's on the take from Martin. And Gunther may try to kill me tonight. But he wasn't the cop in the alley. And Gunther didn't take the money. I don't follow. Uh, what about Higgs? I've been running this over and over in my mind, Charlie. Sometimes, you know, you have to... step back from the puzzle. Get a look at the people. I still don't follow. Whoever was in that alley had everything to do with taking the money. You're way ahead of me. Am I? You see, there were three people that knew how much money that bag was light. Martin, Gunther, and me. But you said something this afternoon keeps coming back to me. You said, "Catarato made off with 190 grand." So what? So what? So how did you know exactly how much money that bag was light? How did you know that, Charlie? Unless it was you that took the money. [gunshot] I swear, I couldn't imagine it would escalate. Now, who'd have thought they'd pin Pepe on you? When I was 16 years old, a cop and his wife came into my life. You and Edie, a ready-made family, no strings attached. And you taught me self-respect and love. I excelled. I excelled, didn't I, Charlie? I loved you. I trusted you. You betrayed me. [clank] I betrayed myself. All those things you said I taught you... I've lost. I'm scared. You know, sometimes, when you're with a disease this long, some of us get infected. And Edie, Edie-- And then there was just us, just the two of us. Look at all the millions we turned in over the years. Chances we've taken, always at risk, for what? Logan? They're going to give me a gold watch and a piss-ant pension. Let's go. Logan, damn it, listen. I'll say that I stole the money. I'll tell them I killed the kid. I'm sorry. I'll tell them anything. It's too late. It's too late, Charlie. Really? Is it really too late? Let's find out, you old fool. [gunshots] Let's go! [gunshots] [yelling] [screams] [gunfire continues] [Man] Hold up! Hold your fire! Logan! It doesn't have to be this way. Stow it! You're on Martin's payroll. So what? The hell is the matter with you, Adam? [distant siren wails] [siren approaches] [Man] Finish it. Captain, we got to go. [gunshots] No, no, no! Damn it, Keith, no! [gunshot] Let's get out of here! Come on! [police radio chatter] Higgs. Walk the detectives through the details. Yes, sir. This still doesn't get you off the hook. I still don't have a killer for Pepe. [siren wails] Leo, the killer is dead. Nine A.M. In my office. Let's see if I can make Myler's offer work. [car doors shut] Hey, kid. You know what scares me about you? What's that? You remind me of me. You hungry? Let's get a hamburger. [Charlie] Myler may think that because they got your gun, you're going to serve time. Hey, leave it to your partner. I turn the money over to Barker and he buys that I saw Catarato shoot Pepe. And you skate. Do you think Hertz is going to let you sell to a jury that you're a thief but you're not a liar? You wouldn't last two weeks in prison. You know that and I know it. How the hell do you think I'm going to live with that? How am I going to live with that, Charlie? I don't know. No. There's no reason for both of us to end up behind bars. What are you going to do? You know, if Myler's as good as she thinks she is, with an early release, you-- you could be out in less than a year. I forgive you, Charlie. I only hope you can forgive yourself. I know that I disappoint-- Don't say anything. Now get out. Charlie? You broke my heart. I know. Where you going? Logan! Hey! I never told you where I hid the money. Don't you want to know where I hid the money? Well, he has a right to be mad. Yep. Yep, I wouldn't respect him if he wasn't. You know, he's just circling the block. Cooling off. He'll turn around and come back. Or maybe not. Closed-Captioned By J.R. Media Services, Inc. Burbank, CA
