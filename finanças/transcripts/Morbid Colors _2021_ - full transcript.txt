I was thinkin' when them king-shit doctors up at that fancy rehab went diggin' around in my daughter's brains and they went and they dug into some stuff maybe they shouldn't have been diggin' in to. Maybe they found somethin's gon' make her hate me more than she already does. Devi too. I think they just left my sad, miserable ass here to rot. I just wanna make it all right, you know? I just wanna make it all right. Make what all right? Oh nevermind, Gwenneth. It's all right. I'm just shit-ass drunk, you know? I need some time to rest. You go on home. Go on home.

Hey, it's Devin. Yeah, we're fine. I called home. Nobody answered. I just wanted to make sure that Leni was okay. Where'd you go? Devin, where did you go? Leni's gone. What? Leni, she's gone. Gone where? She OD'd, Myca. Some time last night. Gwen just told me. How can you laugh at that? Because she was total shit. You don't mean that. Oh, I don't. She was our mother. We weren't there. Now she's gone. Lemme ask you something, Devin. How well did you really know our mother? Myca, stop. That woman, that cunt. She let her crackhead boyfriends fuck me for drugs. She cared more about the junk than her own fucking daughter. And then there's you, her little servant. Myca. You ever wonder why she took you in, huh? Why that crackhead took you in, another little shit that she couldn't even afford? Stop it! She thought she could make up for everything that happened to me by adopting you, another little fuck up. Funny, the only thing that ever made us sisters was that old whore's guilt. No! Jesus Christ. Devin, what can I say? It's over. You made the right call cutting loose of this. Me and you, it just shouldn't be. Not anymore, not like this. I can't stop what's inside me. I know that now. When this thing catches up to me, you can't be there. I gotta do this on my own.
