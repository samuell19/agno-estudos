CHANNING: I never knew what my great-grandfather meant when he said that. And I never thought I'd have to travel 100 years to find out. DISPATCHER ON RADIO: Unit One, Maxwell One-Two, and One, Maxwell Five-Four, proceed at once to Pac-Tech Laboratories, corner of 3rd and Hill. Private security reports terminal incident. Murder of a Dr. Paul Sanderson. Suspect has been identified as a Richard Marcus. He is armed and should be considered extremely dangerous. Repeat. Armed and extremely dangerous. OFFICER ON RADIO: Taylor, we're handling this one with Max-2000. We do not, repeat, do not need manual pursuit. I know you hear me, Channing. No manual pursuit. Now, back off! STUART ON RADIO: Officer Taylor, where are you? You're in big trouble. Do you hear me, Taylor? Big trouble. Thermographic. Yes. Yes, Taylor, you're gonna be a hero. MAN: But for Maxwell Taylor's bravery, courage and self-sacrifice, many lives would have been lost. Night vision. Audio scan. (VOICES CHATTERING) (RAT SQUEAKING) Organic. Human. Twenty-meter radius. (PANTING) (GRUNTS) STUART: Taylor, I am tired of your games! I want to see you now! Do you hear me? Now! COMPUTER: Activate triple ten degree turn... STUART: Intra-council espionage. Suspected involvement in credit code counterfeiting. Seven violations of the nuclear ban of 2012. At least 16 known homicides, with you trying for the assist on number 17. Captain, I'm not stupid. I know Marcus is dangerous. That's why I wore my energy-proof vest. We've been after Richard Marcus for as long as I've been captain of this department. We have never known where he was gonna strike next. We've never known where he disappears to. And we've never come close to capturing him until today. Today, with our Max-2000 computer system, we had him right where we wanted him. And then you had to play hero! You had to try to do the work that was meant for machines! (BEEPING) And now, Marcus is walking around a free man. Do you know what that makes you in my book? Human? Stupid! This department cannot afford stupidity. That's the reason why your great-grandfather invented the Max-2000 and most of the other equipment that you carry. To kick this department into the 21st century, to eliminate human error. Captain, with all due respect, Marcus is human. He's not logical. It's something a machine can't understand. And you can? Do you know what Marcus was doing at Pac-Tech tonight? Do you understand what was so important that he would kill some researcher, some 25-year-old kid, and then leave empty-handed? No. No. But I do know the only thing that's gonna catch Marcus is another human being. I'm beginning to feel like I'm the only one of those left around here. Maxwell Taylor was a great man. He left a legacy of crime-fighting excellence, and a vision of what this department really could be. When you joined the force, we all hoped you might be something like him. Well, I've got his smile. That's gotta count for something. Channing, from day one you've been nothing but a departmental hemorrhoid and a major disappointment to us all. (SCOFFING) Anything else? Yes. You are suspended until further notice. What did it feel like to save the world, to get the girl and live happily ever after? I'll tell you what, Great-Granddad, you and me, same time, same place. They'd see how good a cop I really am. They'd all see. Video on. NEWS ANCHOR ON TV: ...details appear, we will transmit these images to you. And for more on that story, here is Cassandra Barber, at the site. It was discovered here, in the foundation of the old Library Tower Building, at 10 Bunker Hill. It was unearthed by the demolition crew, along with a stash of antique cash and jewels. Police officials speculate it is part of the loot lost in a 100-year-old bank robbery. And what is it? No one will say for sure. At least not yet. One scientist has heralded it as the medical discovery of the century. Another calls it more miracle than medicine. But whatever it is, we're all going to have to wait to find out. Because for now, for the record, no one is talking. This is Cassandra Barber, NBC News, Los Angeles. NEWS ANCHOR: Thank you, Cassandra. Now for another slant on tonight's story, Rex Stanley is at LAPD headquarters with Captain Lydia Stuart, who seems to have very strong opinions on what may have... Video off. You missed your story. Oh, you know how I hate watching myself. So, how was I? Well, let's just say FOX is your only competition. The American public knows what it wants. You. Another Stephen King book? How many does this make? Hundred and seven. That was one of his first. Gosh, I love books. Their smell, their texture, their weight. They have substance. I wish they still made them. I guess I better finish dinner, huh? No, I'll do it. I invited you. I know. But you can't cook. (CHUCKLES) Can I at least help? Why don't you just stay here and mumble to yourself some more? Then after we've eaten, we'll figure out a way to solve your problems, okay? (BEEPING) I checked with some sources. They told me the guy that Marcus killed was researching time travel. Maybe even working on some sort of time machine. Sounds pretty unlikely. I know. Play along. What if time travel were possible? Then a time machine might be something that Marcus would want. But the only problem is, is that he didn't take anything. You said yourself he left empty-handed, right? Something like that would be too big to carry. He'd have to hide it, come back for it later. Hide it? Hide it where? Here's what I figure. What better place to hide a time machine than out of time? Outside the present. You don't hide it somewhere but some time. Hide it in the future where you can't even see it. Marcus could've sent it to a time where he figured no one'd be around, like tonight. It's the weekend. No one's around. He just goes out and waits for it to show up. Yeah, until he catches up to it. Exactly. And that's how he managed to leave empty-handed. Brilliant, huh? (SIGHS) Sounds pretty far-fetched to me. Time travel? Well, how do you explain what... Now, time off, that's something I do understand. Maybe take that trip we've always talked about? For as long as I've been on the force, I've been compared to my great-grandfather. (SIGHS) Just once, I'd like to do something as well as he did. Something big. Something so people would remember who Channing Taylor is. I'll remember. I still gotta prove that man has an edge over a computer. That's why I have to get Marcus by myself. And what about your suspension? Special circumstances call for special actions. Maxwell Taylor, The Future Is Now, page 12, paragraph three. Please understand. I do. And after I get Marcus, we're gonna go on that trip. That's a promise. (SIGHS) I almost forgot. I got you something for listening to all of my problems. It's poems. Shakespeare. Is it okay? The guy at the shop said it was one of the few books that made it through the big library fire of 1986. Page 13 was torn, but that was it. Love Sonnets. "To a woman of substance. "May our love pass the test of time "as surely as these writings. "All my love, Channing." Hey, he probably won't even show up tonight. Be careful, okay? Lights. COMPUTER: Verify authorization. Security clearance magnet card. 7-2-1-5-0-9-B. Equipment arrangement suggests Sanderson was working on an object three meters by three meters in dimension. Time machine? Reason for murdering Sanderson very definitely needs proof. (SIGHS) An antique coin, dated 1976. It's a dime, I think. Or maybe a nickel, I don't know. It's copper. Question, where did Sanderson get a coin outlawed over 50 years ago? One copy of the Los Angeles Tribune, Friday, October... 24, 2088. One week from today, in the future. A coin from the past, a paper from the future. Maybe... (DOOR OPENING) I really had hoped you were dead. Sorry. So, do I at least get to hear how you worked it out? Played a hunch. Something computers don't know anything about. Now, why don't you raise your hands and turn around real easy? (GROANS) I don't think so. Why's that? I've gotta go. Come out! Now! That's an order! (GUN FIRES) (GRUNTING) (CHUCKLES) (GROANS) (MARCUS LAUGHING) MARCUS: Yeah! (GRUNTING) Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. (WHIZZING) (MARCUS EXCLAIMING) (SINGING OPERATICALLY) (MARCUS WHOOPING) MARCUS: So long. Farewell. (LAUGHING TRIUMPHANTLY) (SCREAMING) (GASPS) Marcus. (PEOPLE CHATTERING) Area search. Marcus! Hey, watch out, mister! Drop it! You drop it! Now, I don't know where you got that, but a xenon phaser's nothing to play with. So, why don't you just hand me the gun nice and easy? Die, alien! (BEEPING) (KIDS CHATTERING) Hi. What you want? (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Excuse me, please. Hey, buddy, look, I don't have time for questions right now. Why don't you come back later, huh? Oh, I will. Believe me. I will. (HORN BLARING) (SIREN WAILS) Hey, pal, you wanna give the cars a chance to move? Sorry, officer. What's goin' on? Where is this? 1988? Max's lifetime. (WOMAN CHATTERING ON PA) MARCUS: I've traveled a long way, Dr. Langdon. I'm afraid that the journey may have left me somewhat irritable. So, try a nap. I'm not giving you the vaccine. I know you are not. You haven't got it. Well, if you know that, why are you here? (LAUGHS) Because you put the vaccine in a bank safety deposit box. I just want the key to that box. Well, that kind of defeats the purpose of the bank, doesn't it? (LAUGHS) Yes. So does the man who's about to rob it in two days. Now, the key. I don't have it. (HUMMING) My God. (POLICE SIREN WAILING) (TIRES SQUEALING) So, he is here. Excuse me. Give me a sec, huh? I'm workin'. What are you doing? It was burning. What do you want? The woman who witnessed this murder. Says here she works part-time at a place called the Storm Cellar. You know where that is? Not from around here, huh? That depends. Where is here? The Storm Cellar's in Hollywood. It's a little bar right off Hollywood Boulevard. Hollywood. I know Hollywood. Thanks! Hey! Do you wanna pay for the paper? Pay for old news? Thanks, anyway. I know who Pam Wallace is. After today's paper, what goofball doesn't? But that doesn't change anything. She's not here. Well then, can you tell me where she lives? It's important. What I know and what I'm telling are two different things. So, what are you telling? Same thing I told the other guy that was looking for her. Today she works the late shift. You wanna talk to her? Try back at 8:00, wear a coat and tie, and it's 10 bucks at the door. Uh, just a couple more questions. The other guy that was looking for Pam? What'd he look like? Blonde hair, slicked back, long coat, boots. Not exactly Mr. Personality. Marcus. Anything else? Yeah. What's a tie? What kind of batteries were those again? Plutonium. But anything nuclear-powered will be just fine. Would that be "N" cells? Nickel-cadmium. I've heard about these. Maybe quantity will make up for quality in this case. Will that be cash or charge? Charge. You take World Express? No. Just Visa and MasterCard. Cash. And throw in a lottery ticket. Uh, not that one. Not that one either, if you don't mind. It's unlucky. Look, do you want a ticket or don't you? That one. Sorry. Cash first. I'll share. How much? 10 bucks. Could you do that again? (CHATTERING) (INDISTINCT) (CHATTERING) (PANTING) Sorry. You wouldn't happen to know Max Taylor, would you? (LAUGHS) "Just the facts" Max? Are you a friend of his? Sort of. Didn't know he had any. He pulled guard duty down at city rail construction site. Wouldn't think there'd be much trouble in that area. Exactly. (HUMMING) MAX: Hmm, who might this be? Hey. Hey, buddy, hold it right there. What, it's against the law to take a walk? Yeah, it is when you're trespassing. Hey, come on, hold it. Get real. Hey, you heard me. I said hold it. Hey! Freeze! No respect for the law anymore. Taylor, you're gonna be a hero. Oh, jeez. This is Officer Maxwell Taylor. I am engaged in foot pursuit with a 6-0-2 PC. Request backup. Does anybody copy? MAX ON RADIO: You gotta push the button to talk, boys. That's you. Thanks. It's the little thing on the side of the mike. Max, is that you? This is Maxwell Taylor. Situation is in control. Request unit to assist in wrap-up. Over. Max, get off that Mickey Mouse unit of yours and use a police radio. What? Are you kidding? You think they'd give Taylor his own unit? (BOTH LAUGHING) Yeah, this is Max Taylor again. Um, listen, guys, correction on that last report. I am tracking perpetrator south on Hill Street. Request backup. Does anybody copy? Guys? Guys, are you there? Hey, can you lose the pizza for a second? Hello? I got 20 says it's another false alarm. No way. That's a sucker's bet. I don't mean to butt in, but aren't you guys gonna do anything? It sounds like he needs help. You gotta understand, mister. This is police business. It's not the kind of help we can give. I understand. You don't. That's Max Taylor! You can't let anything happen to Max! Nothing can happen to Max! (STATIC) (BUZZING) Sure beats following footprints. (BEEPING) (HEARTBEAT POUNDING) Come on, baby, keep talkin' to me. (HEARTBEAT GETS LOUDER) (MEOWING) Don't you cats have a home? Minor note on the audio magnifier. Need to distinguish the human heartbeat from the animals'. (SIGHING) Are you kidding? (GRUNTING) Max. Hands up, mister. You're making a mistake, Max. He's the bad guy. I know who he is. Max Taylor doesn't make mistakes. Max Taylor is thorough. Now, just throw that thing over there. I'm taking you both in. Max, I just helped you... I don't need your help. 'Cause, mister, when you got thoroughness, success is waiting in the wings right around the next corner. Don't you mean, "Diligence is the only margin between victory and despair?" I know what I mean. Just do what I say. Sorry, Max. I really am. There just isn't any time for all that. Hold it. Stop right there or I'll shoot. No, you won't. Goodbye, Max. Hey, I said I'd shoot. No, no, no! I'm tired of hearing about your gadgets and your computers. How many times do I have to tell you? Computers don't catch crooks. Cops catch crooks. I know that, Captain, but if you just... No buts! No buts! There'll never be a substitute for what a cop has got right up here. Yes, sir. But it was my gadgets that helped us grab Ed Hawkins. A man who committed six bank robberies in the last year. A man, I might add, that our detectives weren't doing diddly to stop. And a man you have charged with trespassing. You got lucky, it happens. And there's nothing wrong with the detectives in this department either. (SOFTLY) Except they don't have the brains God gave geese. Pardon me? Nothing. It's just, sir, that they don't have what I have. They don't have the Max-500. The what? Max-500. My new system. It's gonna completely revolutionize... I don't want to hear it! Fine. And next time use your cuffs. I don't want you bringing your suspects in here wrapped like leftovers. (PEOPLE CHATTERING) Frank. Pam Wallace here yet? You're a little early. Nice outfit. Can I get you something to drink? Sure. How about an Adrenalin Fizz? What? Uh, never mind. I guess I'm a little earlier than I thought. Soon as I see Pam, I'll send her over. Remember, I'll be keepin' an eye on you. Thanks, Frank. Yeah, sure. Doesn't that hurt? Get lost. Hiya, Frank. Where do you want me, usual station? Yeah. But first, one of those guys I told you about is here to see you. Seems kind of weird. Another cop? I don't think so. Even they got better taste in clothes. Where is he? He's right... He's gone. (PEOPLE EXCLAIMING) Hold it, Marcus! (ANGRILY) Doesn't anything hold a charge anymore? (TIRES SCREECHING) Not in my city, you don't. Don't these people ever learn? (POLICE SIREN APPROACHING) (MAX GRUNTS) You again! Max, I'd like to talk, but... Don't! You have the right to remain silent. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford one, one will be... ...appointed by the court. Thought you could outrun me. (DOOR CLOSING) (SIGHING) Well, well, well. If it ain't the man from Glad. You should know better than to play with history. Our Mr. Hawkins here doesn't belong behind bars. He has a job to do. Tomorrow as I recall. And you? Let's just say I don't enjoy being a historical custodian. Anyway, while you're alive, you're going to keep messing things up. Hey, I don't know who you are, or why you're helping me. But you got a score to settle with this guy, do it alone. What's going on in here? (SIREN BLARING) (GROANING) Hey, are you crazy, man? Come on, every cop in the place is gonna be here. Come on! (OFFICERS SHOUTING) OFFICER 1: We got open cells. Check it out! OFFICER 2: Keep it moving! Keep it moving! What happened in here? You better talk. I'll talk. But only to Maxwell Taylor. I got news for you, Mr. H.G. Wells. I have vision enough for everybody in this department. I've got ideas that would boggle the minds of every dunderhead I work with. In short, I am a man ahead of my time. But what I am not is stupid. And that is precisely what is required to believe anything you've told me. The name's not H.G. Wells. It's Channing Wells. And I didn't believe in time travel either, until now. Until I came here. Well then maybe you wanna tell me how it all works. I don't know how it works. So, you're like the future's version of a trained chimp then. Kind of an experiment? All right. All right. (SIGHS) I didn't wanna have to do this, but I can see it's the only way. I'm gonna have to give you a little peek into the future. I'm all ears. All right. There's gonna be this horrible little war and it's gonna drag on for years and years. And we lose. And it takes place in this tiny country called... Vietnam? Well, big deal. So, I'm not so good with dates. And I'll bet you've never heard of Watergate. Ancient history. Yeah, how about an actor gets voted into the White House. Gee. Ronald Reagan? He was an actor, too? (SCOFFS) (SIGHS) Hey, your possessions. Tell me what these are supposed to prove. Take a look. What are these things? It's your future, Max. Most of these were... Will be your idea. Aren't you a little bit old to be playing with toys? Look at all this stuff. What'd Buck Rogers have a garage sale? What's that supposed to be? It's a health alert. You know, green means healthy. Yellow, see a doctor. Red, a priest. Hey. Wait, wait, wait, hey, hey, wait. That was me, wasn't it? Huh? I'm gonna be famous, aren't I? I'm gonna be famous, right? Twelve-hour mini-series. I knew it. I knew it! I knew I was gonna be famous. I can see it all now. Endorsements and merchandising and money and... You know, helping people, too. Hey. What else do you know about me? Wouldn't it take all the fun out of it if I told you? Oh, no, no. I hate fun. What I believe in is destiny. Particularly my own. Then help me get out of here and find Marcus, and I'll tell you anything you need to know. I could lose my badge. Yeah. Tough to make Chief without a badge. Chief? Well. Chief, huh? You... You know I'm gonna make Chief? Well, you know, like I always say, you gotta take a chance if you wanna get ahead, right? Don't you mean, "Risk is the price of all worthwhile rewards"? That's good, too. Hey, what do you say we get out of here, huh? I've got a destiny waiting. Fantastic. Do I really invent that thing? That's the way they tell it at the Academy. The Academy? I tell you, sometimes I even amaze myself. Are you sure you wanna do this, Max? It could be dangerous. I'm not looking for a good time. It's like I say, you can't always have fun doing what you're supposed to do. Hey, don't you mean, "Sacrifice is the better part of service"? No. The way I said it was good, too. Stop rewriting me. (LAUGHS) It's not me, Max. It's history. If you know so much about history, where'd you learn to dress like that? It looks like Ringling Brothers has a retail outlet. I bought it here. It doesn't matter. It's conspicuous. If you're gonna be a fugitive you have to learn to downplay fashion. All right. We've gotta get to Pam at the Storm Cellar before Marcus does. Why? You think he'll try to kill her? She can ID him in that scientist's murder? No. Marcus didn't travel 100 years for anything as simple as murder. He wants something. And either Pam has it or she can tell us what it is. What about Hawkins? Where does he fit in? The guy robs banks. Banks? You do have banks in 2088, don't you? Max, history led me to believe you'd have a few more answers and a lot less questions. Go. Listen, I'm not a killer. I don't snatch women off the street. I steal from banks and I'm very good at it. You spent time in jail. That was a mistake. Seems to me without my help, you'll never get into this bank. Not by tomorrow, not like you planned. You help me get what I want, and I'll help you get what you want. How'd you know I was planning on making a withdrawal tomorrow? Oh, I know a great many things, Mr. Hawkins. How I know isn't really important. Yeah, well what is important to you, man? Huh? The future. And if I don't help you? Oh. Well, in that case. There are a few other things I know about. Like. I know how you die, Mr. Hawkins. And I know when. And if you attempt to desert me in any way, I will share that information with you. (CLEARS THROAT) Magnify. X-ray. See anything you like? Well, she's got an old break in the right femur and a mouth full of fillings, but who am I to demand perfection? Well, I don't think she's your type anyway. Not my type? What would you know about my... Now, wait a second. You do know my type. You know exactly my type. You know who I'm gonna marry, don't you? Max, I shouldn't have said anything. Why? What would be so wrong about telling me about that? Max, I said too much already. What? It's... Oh. She's ugly, right? That's what it is, isn't it? I'm gonna marry a woofer, right? That's what it is. That's what you can't bear to tell me, is that Max Taylor is gonna go through life married to a best of breed. No, Max. Max, she's not. She's smart then, right? I mean, she's smart? Smart with a great personality. I know the type. I can live with that. I'll just have all the fun I can until I meet her. Fun? Yeah, fun. You do have that in 2088, don't you? You mean pre-marital stuff? People still do that? (CLEARS THROAT) I take it you're married. No, But there's someone... (SIGHS) If I ever get back. Hold on here. Are you telling me that when it comes to female, women of the opposite sex that you never... Speaking of fun... Got a light? Boy, have you got the wrong guy. Light? For what? MAX: He's been away for a while. Thanks. What was that? That was one of the greatest come-ons I've ever seen. No, I don't mean that. I mean that thing in her mouth. Cigarette? I've seen a lot of those. What do they do? I don't know. But I think I've figured how this gizmo of yours works. The pulse laser? How? The stuff in there won't be around for another 50 years. Yeah, the words may change, but the song remains the same. What? The tools, the parts. There's always gonna be something new, but the principles, those don't change. Take this doohickey right here. Max. I figured out it's some sort of regulator by its placement. Max, Max, the hows don't interest me. All I gotta know is does it work or doesn't it? Can I count on it or not? Count on it. That is, if I can ever get it back together. I'm afraid you're gonna have to come back tomorrow night. Pam's going home and says she doesn't care to talk to anyone. BOTH: Did you tell her it was important? Did you tell her it was police business? She goes out the back way. If you hurry, you might be able to catch her yet. I'll take care of Pam. You take care of those. Pam! Pam Wallace! I have to talk to you! I don't wanna talk. There's nothing left for me to talk about. Try the man who killed Dr. Langdon. I know who he is. Then I'd say that's all the more reason for me to keep my distance. His name is Richard Marcus. I chased him here... From the future. My name is Channing Taylor. I'm a policeman. Goodnight. Great, Channing. Great come on. (TIRES SQUEALING) Hey! Put me down! What are you doing? Let me go! Get your hands off me! Help! Get your hands off me! Help! Go. Let me go. Get your hands off me. You have some keys. I want them. I don't know what you're talking about. I don't have any keys! I don't have any keys! Let go of me! Forward. Start! They're in my purse. Drive! (EXCLAIMS) What are you doing? Marcus has got Pam and this thing won't start. (ENGINE REVVING) Maybe it's cause you don't have the keys. Yeah, how am I supposed to know that? (TIRES SQUEALING) You know I... Stick with your own guns, Max. MARCUS: I want that key now! I'm getting it. I'm... (SCREAMING) My eyes. Get us out of here! What about the girl? Forget the girl! You. Watch her. Stop! Police! Hold that car! No. Wait, I'm a good guy. I don't care. Okay? You gotta listen to me, we need your help. Who are you? Stop! Police! What are you doing? Put me down. (MUFFLED SCREAMING) Stop it... I'm sorry, I really am. I just really need the chance to talk to you. (TIRES SQUEALING) (SIRENS WAILING) Boy, am I glad you guys are here. I gotta report an APB. It's Hawkins. He's driving a '61 Bentley. I didn't really get a good look at the plates, but it's a big old Bentley. I mean, you can't hardly miss it. Hey! Hey look! You said you'd be quiet. (SHUSHING) Shh! Please. DISPATCHER ON RADIO: Unit in vicinity respond. Max, you've been a very bad boy. What? What? Hey! Hey, who put you up to this? Was it Rodriguez? You know, I owe the guy money. But that's no reason to have me arrested. This isn't supposed to happen. Oh, God. The Captain was right. I'm a major disappointment. CHANNING: Max. How'd it go in there? Smile. Are they gonna help us get Marcus? What did you do that for? Not exactly a Kodak moment. That was for getting me suspended from the force! Well, maybe we should try this again. Good idea. What was that for? Same thing. I got you suspended from the force? Now, hey, hey. Hey, guys, think of me here, huh? I mean, it's not every day that I come face to face with a time traveler and a cop. I mean no one's going to believe me. You, butt out. Huh? And you. I'm surprised you even made the force, if that's what they call it where you come from. Why don't we take our fight somewhere else? I'm happy right here. Why don't we just forget about the fight? Those things you told me last night. There are some things we all need to talk about. I'm through trying to talk to him. He doesn't understand anything anyway. He doesn't know what a tie is. He doesn't know what a bank is. He doesn't know what a cigarette is. He doesn't even know what... Don't push me. It wouldn't take much right now. What's that? The Vulcan mind meld? Do you have any idea how long I've lived under your shadow? How impossible you've made my life? Max Taylor did this. Max Taylor did that. The great Max Taylor! Why can't you be more like Max? Buddy, you have got a problem. Yeah, I know I do. You. Yeah? Well, I've had enough. I'm out of here. No, wait. For what? Because he's your... Shh! I mean, you should listen to him. Max, we've got work to do. We're not through yet. Oh, yeah. We are. 'Cause I've had it with you. I've had it with you telling me what to do and when to do it. Even how to do it. Who do you think you are? My father? No. Not your father. I'm just trying to keep things right. Then why don't you just leave me alone? Look, my life is my life. Your name's not in that little book about me because you weren't here then. Now. Whenever. But somehow, somehow I managed. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to go out there and make my own mistakes. And my own magic. Go ahead. I'll find Hawkins and Marcus without you. You don't want my help with the future? Try it alone! Fine. I will. It's my future. What's it to you, anyway? It's my future, too, Max. I'm your great-grandson, Max. Oh, that's good. That's really rich. You'll just say anything to get ol' Max to bail you out of your troubles. Well, I'm not buying it, pal. It's true, Max. Hard to believe, but true. You don't think I'm in this book? Take a look. Go ahead. I thought you didn't want me to see the great book. I didn't. If my natural charm and pearly whites aren't enough. Max, I am your great-grandson. Now, I don't wanna believe you but I do. Okay? So, you're my great-grandson. What do you want? Cigars? Proclamations? "Congratulations, it's a boy"? No. Just your help. That's all. Okay. Okay, so why are we here? Pam thinks she knows what Marcus is after. Dr. Langdon's research project. She was working on some sort of white knight agent that turned diseased cells into healthy ones. A cure? An accident. But it worked. At least in the tests. It worked. Sickle-cell anemia, cancers. Anything cell related. She just needed time to figure out how she'd done it. How did Marcus find out about it? A vial with the solution is found in my time. It was buried in the foundation of the library tower downtown, part of the loot from a bank robbery. A bank! I should've known she wouldn't keep it here. Yes, yes, bank! That's how Hawkins fits in. Nobody does banks better. Marcus is using Hawkins to get the vial. When Marcus broke him out of jail he said something about a job they had to do. We haven't got much time. Says you. Which bank? Didn't say. Don't know. Great. Well, wait. I know how we can find it. You know, this one isn't half-bad. Honey, can we forget the pictures for a minute? The bank. Marcus wanted a key from me. He must've meant the key to the bank safety deposit box. And the key would have the name of the bank. And you have the key. No. I gave it to the police. It's with the rest of Dr. Langdon's things. Oh, great. We Taylors are so popular down at the station house these days. I'll go. No. You've done enough. We can't drag you any further into this. You haven't dragged me anywhere. That man killed Dr. Langdon, could've killed me. I'm in. So, what's the plan? There is but a single dependable ally, and its name is surprise. You know, that's not half-bad. Can I use that? You will. It's set to go off in five minutes, unless you let my boyfriend go. All right, look, lady, if we cleared out the station house or set some prisoners free every time we got a bomb scare, we'd be working in the park. Now, I'm sure it is. Listen, I'll, have the bomb squad get right on it. (PEOPLE SCREAMING) Bishop, Carter, DiNoto. Get in there and watch those prisoners. Don't rush right in there! They might've set another bomb. Everybody outside. You are responsible for your own safety. Outside! (SCREAMING) You got the key? I had to turn them in. No problem. Thanks to you I've got a light. That's amazing. I can't wait to invent that thing. Come on. Langdon, Dr. Kerry. Safety deposit box number 3114, Golden West Bank. The key. To a bank that's gonna be knocked over this afternoon. And we're gonna be there when it is. (CARS HONKING) MAX: No, I don't have a crystal ball. It doesn't matter how I know, I just know, all right? Now, the vault is gonna be broken into today. Do I get backup or not? MAN: And never mind that you're suspended, Taylor. We can't spare the units. It seems someone in Burbank predicted an invasion from Pluto today, and we got everybody out there to handle crowd control. You're on your own, buddy boy. Over and out. I hope you're happy. Thanks to you I'm a laughing stock. A joke amongst my peers. Nothing personal, Max, but since I'm family I think I can be honest with you. It seems to me you were a joke without my help. Well, what are we doing sitting here? We've got feet, let's use 'em. At least we'd be moving. Is it always like this? Why? They don't have traffic where you come from? You mean when I come from? No. So, how do people get to work? They work at home. What about shopping? What do you think television's for? Listen, I've got nothing against a little exercise, but why shouldn't we take the city rail? Sure, if you don't mind a five-year wait till they get it built. Not built? No, but just a half finished system of tunnels all over the city. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no! Well? Oh, no, what? We can't be here. You can't be here. Today's Saturday, October 19th. What are you talking about? Your life! It says here that on the afternoon of Saturday, October 19th, 1988, the city rail tunnel collapses. You're supposed to be there. You save the life of every construction worker in the tunnel. I do? I mean, when? When is this all supposed to take place? Ten minutes. 3rd and Hill. My old beat. Forget it. We will never make it. It is impossible. Impossible is nothing but an excuse for the weak and a challenge for the bold. Did I get that right? Verbatim. Now, whether they know it or not, there are people counting on us. So, what's it gonna be? I vote bold. Bold. Unanimous. So, what are we doing here? (EXCLAIMS) Forget it, Marcus. We're wasting our time. We're not gonna get through. Unless maybe you'd like to help dig. I don't dig. Do you wanna see me in that vault? 'Cause it's gonna take more than one shovel and your winning personality. Explosives. Each capsule with a destructive force equivalent to one stick of dynamite. Yeah? So, how do they detonate? Just add water. Or sweaty palms. I just hate stealing. I am a cop, you know. It's the only way you're gonna make it, Max. Besides, I never even rode one of these things. Thank the guy it belongs to when you accept your medal of commendation. Happens to be a very outmoded... Medal of commendation, huh? Tonight I ride. You coming with me? It's your destiny, Max. I have my own. With Marcus. In case you need anything... I don't even know how most of that stuff works. Well, something tells me you'll understand it all better than I do. (ENGINE SPUTTERING) And I'm not cheating? You know, the flow of history and all that? Probably. But why take chances? It's your first recorded act of heroism. Blow it and I may never have your shadow to live in. Hey, look, about that, I wanted to tell you, I am sorry about all the trouble I caused you in the future. If I had known your life was gonna be so miserable because of me I wouldn't have been so great. But time's on your side, you know. Yeah. It could be worse. Just think of the stories you're gonna be telling your great-grandson. (ENGINE REVVING) It was nice meeting you, Gramps. Same here, son. Hey, guys, five minutes. Yeah. Hey, one more thing. In your time, in all you ever read about me, does it ever say I was afraid? Never. Yeah. Well, don't believe everything you read, kid. Pam? You've done more to help than I had any right to expect. Thank you. One more thing, call the police. Why? Just in case. Well, what about you? Marcus. Be careful, okay? What? Nothing. It just reminded me of someone else for a second. (SIGHS) Are you sure two capsules are enough? That's a lot of concrete overhead. Are you serious? All right, so they dissolve, then what? Then unless you're out of this tunnel, they blast your skull through 10 feet of solid concrete. So, that's all there is to it? I mean, you break me out of jail, you put me on schedule, and then you take off? Why? Because I like control. Because I know when the time is right. And because this is the way it's supposed to be. And you don't want anything, huh? I'll know where to find you. I've never seen anything like it before. There are bodies everywhere. That's right. 3rd and Hill Street. SUPERVISOR: Drag her out a little bit more, man. WORKER: All right. Hey! Everybody, get out of the tunnel! Get out of this tunnel! Clear the tunnel. The tunnel's gonna collapse. Says who? Maxwell Taylor, LAPD. It's a name you might wanna remember. Is this some kind of joke? Is there anybody still left down there? Well, there's another crew a little further down. Okay, everyone! Just in case this guy ain't a nut, let's get out of here! Come on, move it! Come on! Move it! Let's go! Hustle, hustle, hustle! Max! (ALARM BELL RINGING) All right. MAX: Hello? Anybody? Anybody hear me? MAN 1: We're trapped. Can you get us out? MAN 2: Help us out of here! Don't panic. My name is Maxwell Taylor. I'm with the Los Angeles Police Department. I'm here to rescue you. MAN 1: All right, Max! MAN 2: Help us out of here. I will. Now, stand back as far as you can in the tunnel. MAN 1: Get back. Get back, everybody. (MEN CLAMORING) MAX: Everybody okay in there? Look out, look out with your arm. (ALARM BELL RINGING) (SIREN WAILING) Max? Max? Hey, has anyone seen Max Taylor? Maxwell Taylor? You know the guy? Yes. I wouldn't be standing here right now if it weren't for him. I owe him my life. Do you know where he is? He hasn't come out yet. (CHEERING) You did it. You're a hero. Yeah. And I had a little help. What do you say we go return the favor, huh? MARCUS: Whoa! Don't do that. Not yet. What do you mean not yet? There's cops everywhere, man. If they find me with this stuff. How'd you know I was here? Simple 20-20 hindsight. Hey, man, what'd I ever do? Nothing. I just checked you out. You see, tomorrow you get arrested for today's robbery, and you spend the next three years in prison. And you die there. You know, you have your throat slit with a lid from a can of baked beans. A real mess. And all because you won't tell 'em where you hid this. I don't know what you're saying. What I'm saying is that your life is meaningless. Please. Please. (LAUGHS) (GROANS) Isn't it enough that you mess things up in your own time? It's not really a matter of time, is it? Yeah? Well, I disagree. 'Cause right now we're out of time in more ways than one. And I'm taking you and that medical miracle back where we belong. Oh, you are, are you? So, it can be distributed by the government or some large pharmaceutical company, right? Whatever's best for the people who need it. Oh, don't get me wrong, I'm all for helping needy people. As long as they can afford it. Who do you think you are? God? You can't decide who gets well and who dies. Why not? I've decided it's time for you to die. No! (GRUNTS) Max. Max! Get him. Get Marcus. Forget about me. I can't, Max. I need you. (WHIRRING) What's that? CHANNING: It's a health alert. Get a doctor. Hang on, Max. I'll be back. Max. DISPATCHER: Rescue 48, you have an open line to Mercy Hospital. Transmit when ready. Oh, Max. Just a little while longer. CHANNING: Get out! Come out! I swear I'll blow it up! Are you crazy? This is our only way back. My great-grandfather's dying. And if he does you'll never be born, will you? You won't exist. Are you coming out? Yeah, all right, I'll consider it the last wish of a dead man. What are you doing? You can't leave me here stranded forever. There's only enough fuel left for one more trip. I got no choice. But I do. (YELLING) (INSTRUMENTS BEEPING) Oh, Max. This better work. It's not really a matter of time, now, is it? CHANNING: Well, I disagree. 'Cause right now we're out of time in more ways than one. Oh, don't get me wrong, I'm all for helping needy people. As long as they can afford it. Who do you think you are? God? You can't decide who gets well and who dies. Why not? I've decided it's time for you to die. No! (GRUNTS) (SCREAMS) Max? Max? Max? How'd you do it, kid? How'd you know? Know what? That I was gonna need the energy proof vest. It's like you knew it was gonna happen all along. Hey, Channing, let me ask you something. Is this also one of my inventions? Max, you don't invent everything, you know. Just asking. Channing, did you find the vial? It's with Marcus. Then we better get it. No. Leave it there. That's where it's meant to be found. But we could help people. We could save lives. Think about the lives that may never be because of it. Lives in my time. We can't change history. Then take it back with you. Make sure the people of the future have it. I'm not going back. I can't. Why? Afraid you're gonna miss your old great-granddad? No. My time machine's out of fuel. MAX: So? We'll refuel it. CHANNING: What? Invent fuel that won't be around for another 100 years? MAX: Hundred years, nothing. With my smarts and your vision we'll make our own fuel. CHANNING: I don't know. MAX: Oh, I do. We'll make our own fuel. If you think I'm gonna get stuck with you for the rest of my life... (CHEERING) And so... And so in honor of Maxwell Taylor, whose acts of heroism frankly leave me speechless, the Mayor has decreed that a permanent memorial be established. (PEOPLE APPLAUDING) And it reads, "But for Maxwell Taylor's bravery, courage and self-sacrifice, "many lives would have been lost" and it's dated October 19th, 1988. Thank you. Thank you. Vision and verve, that's my motto. And remember, the future is now. (CROWD CHEERING) CHANNING: I'm writing this to you long before you're ever born. Long before I'm ever born, for that matter. Strange, huh? But not as strange as the feeling I have, Cassandra. The feeling I'll never see you again. So, I suppose my future is here, in the past. The present. And that's why I can't ask you to wait for me. But wherever I go, whatever time I live in, I take your love with me, because I've learned something. I've learned that love is the one thing that never changes. The one thing time can't touch. P.S. I thought you might like a picture of me. The other guy? That's my great-grandfather, Max. You'll read a lot of stories about him, but don't believe them. He never would have gotten anywhere without me.
