-The things you lose, you don't ever get back. It can never happen again except in the smudgy carbon copy of memory. There are things that seem irreconcilable that you must find a way to reconcile with. The simple passage of days tells the sharpness of the pain, but never quite wears it out. And it doesn't get washed away with time. It becomes a cold hard lump of something, and a loseable souvenir. Donny once told me, there's no future in holding on to the past. -I've never taken the train before. -I used to come up almost every weekend. -With Tony? -Um-hmm. Haven't been up for almost a year. -Oh, Lyle called. He's bringing a friend. -He didn't say he was bringing a friend when I talked to him Thursday. -Well, maybe it's a new friend. -Lyle comes up here, John, to get away from his friends. He's certainly not going to bring one with him. -Well, he is today on the 1140. -He hasn't been up all summer, and then to come up this weekend and bring someone, it seems odd. -What is so special about this weekend? -It's the anniversary of Tony's death. You think Lyle's forgot? -Of course not. -You did. -Tony wasn't my lover. -Nope. He was your brother. -He was my half brother, actually. -Are we there yet? -Soon. -You know, you have ugly feet. -Don't. It's cold. -Feet, in general, are pretty ugly, but yours are especially ugly if you look at them closely. -Well, then don't look at them closely. -Anything gets uglier the more you look at it. -Not true. -Name one ugly thing that gets more beautiful if you look at it closely. -Insect. -Actually, I like your feet. They're genuine. Old World. Biblically even. -Do that again. My Old World feet liked it. -Come on in, you'll get used to it. -Mission accomplished? -Hey. -I did my part. -Yes, but did John do his? -Let's just hope he did something. And a cheer. -Do you make love differently when you're trying to get pregnant? -I forgot what it's like to make love and try not to get pregnant. -Was that a mating schedule I saw stuck on your refrigerator? -That is not on the refrigerator. That's on top of the refrigerator. You snooped. -Oh, god, I feel no desire to procreate. -I prefer the idea of having a ward a la Dick Grayson in Batman. -It's hot out here. I wish I'd brought my bathing suit. -I don't have mine on. -You never have yours on. -Take off your dress. Come here, get naked. To be naked is to be oneself. -I'm not getting nude in front of this one. -No, no, nude is set on display, but a naked body reveals itself without disguise. -Oh, for Christ's sake. You two are impossible. OK, if this goes out in the refrigerator, I'll kill you both. Duh-duh-da-duh. -What should I do about beds for Lyle and his friend? One or two? Are they sleeping together? -Didn't ask. Two and leave it to them. -Different rooms? -The same room should be fine. -Lyle always sleeps in the yellow room. -Things are about to change with Lyle. Mustn't let it upset you? -Wouldn't matter. LAURA (OFFSCREEN): Perspective is nothing but a scientific fact. If it disturbs you, ignore it. My husband's disdain for perspective was legendary. Something of a disadvantage in an architect. I'm such a moron. I'm making you sound like one, too. You made so much more sense in life, darling, than you do in death. OK, that's gotta go. That does, too. -Nina, if your mother's so awful, why have we come all this way to spend the weekend with her? I didn't say she was awful. -You did. Since we left the city three hours ago. You've done nothing but criticize her. You know how precious our free time is. Hmm. We could have been in Santa Monica by now. -Yeah, but I'm not in Santa Monica. -Neither is your mother. -I thought you might like some iced tea. -Thank you. -If you don't mind my asking, why don't you just sweep those up? -They burst and stain the patio. -Oh. Well, there really is a reason for everything, isn't there? I have plenty of time for small talk. -It took forever for us to find this place. -Nina. How lovely to see you. Though it would have been more wonderful if I'd known you were coming. -Well, it was one of those spur of the moment things, you know, like getting married. This is Thierry by the way. -Hello. -[SPEAKING_FRENCH] -Then this is-- -Jerry, how are you? -Fine, Jerry, how are you? -Jerry drove us up. I thought it would be a lot cheaper than a cab, but it wasn't. -Oh, how much do I owe? -$300? -I also told him he could have a swim in the pool. -Well, certainly. Certainly. I'm sure we have a spare pair of Speedos somewhere. The people I rented this house from moved out in such a hurry, you'd be surprised what they left behind. -Well, it certainly is a bitch to get to, but it's lovely. -I'm not supposed to get too much sun. I'm playing a prostitute. -Are you an actor, too, Theirry? -No, I train the pigeons in this movie. -The pigeons? -Thierry can get a pigeon to do almost anything. -Yeah. Uh, we use to use carrier pigeons, but they're all extinct. So now we use street pigeons. They're so much easier to use than the common cairns and herring goals that we used when we did the remake of Hitchcock "Birds" with Nina. -I played a topless dancer who gets pecked to death by a chicken. -Great film. -I don't think I saw that one. -Well, you told me you did. My mother thinks that all film people are hypocrites, especially me. -That's not true, Nina, and I'm very proud of everything you do. -Why is it that every time you pat me on the back, mother, it feels like there's a knife in your hand? I hope there's no chlorine in the pool. I'll get a rash. -Well, you are playing a prostitute. -What have you done to your hair? -Cut it. -Oh, you look great. -I am great, thanks to-- -So you're the reason we haven't seen Lyle all summer, and here he's trying to convince us that he's been working on book number two. Have you read his book, Robert? -Actually, no. Lyle won't let me read it. I think he's afraid it might scare me off. -Oh, well, it might. It stopped me from painting, but it's a wonderful book. -Which has only just come out in paperback, so I really don't need to write a second book now, do I? I work at the museum, and traveling almost every weekend. -Oh, poor baby. And I might as well exploit my celebrity while I can. -Your what? -On a very small scale. That's all I meant. Oh, god, Tony would have been mortified to see you celebrate. -Not exploit it? -Celebrate it. -So how are you? -Fine. I mean, it's been a bit muggier than usual, but I'm fine. -How are you? -So how long have you lived up here? -Oh, um, we moved up here for good two years ago. It used to be more of a weekend retreat. -Hmm, a debauchery. -Are you hot back there, Robert? -Oh, I'm fine, thanks. So do you miss New York? -Sorry? -Do you miss New York? -Um, sometimes, but it's easy enough to get into the city if you want. Although with little Rowland, that's become a thing of the past. -How is little Rowland? -Fine. He's at home helping John with his wall. -His wall? -His wall. John is building a stone wall at the edge of the lake. -That's interesting. -What for? -Oh, who knows what goes on in his mind. [BABY CRYING] -Rowland, hey, what are you doing? John? -Uh, John, John. Hey, buddy. I want you to meet Robert. -How are you? -Good, John. -Hey, Rowland. -The sticks. I can't believe you actually live here. -I'd like to leave sometimes. -John, you were supposed to be watching him. -I was. He was about to stick a wicket in his eye. -Are you helping Daddy with his wall? -How did you know about that? -I told him. -It's supposed to be a surprise. -Decorative or functional? Which one is it? -You have to wait and see. -I don't want to wait and see. -All right, come on, let's go down. Robert, you want to come? -Sure. -Maybe Robert would like to freshen up first and save the surprise for later. -I don't mind. -Yeah, come on. It's just down there. -You don't have to be polite up here, Robert. Why don't we take your bags, and I'll get you a beer? -Whatever. -Nice to meet you, John. -Nice to see you, too. -Look at this. Wow. -So how long have you known Robert? -Three weeks. I met him at an artist colony in Maine. Skowhegan, do you know it? -You're dating a painter? -Not me. Paintings dead, man, haven't you read my book? -I guess that makes being an art critic a hell of a lot easier. -The best thing about Maine, apart from meeting Lyle is I got to paint all day. I don't really have that luxury in New York. -Why not? -Can't afford it. -But as an artist, you can't really afford not to. -Well, I'll remember that the next time I can pay my rent. That was meant to sound encouraging. Do you like children, Robert? -Uh, I like their hands and their feet. -Well, that's a start. -Oh, no, sorry. I don't drink beer. -Um, we have wine. -Uh, water would be great. -Hmm. Water's coming up. -Thanks. -So what do you paint? -Contemporary landscapes. -Oh, any insights on shopping malls and parking lots? I'll get you a glass. -Uh, well, I paint what I see and hope it's significant. Lyle said you were a painter, too. -Did he? Well, that's more than he's ever said to me. It's more of a hobby these days. I don't think that there's anything I have to say that hasn't been said before. -Come on, how do you know? You silence the artist, and you silence the most articulate voice that people have. -Well, let's just take your bags upstairs and think about that one. -Oscar Wilde. I don't know what year though. -Hmm, very Donna Reed. -Oh. Don't be nostalgic for the 50s. They were terribly drab. -Really? Even with you in them? -Yes, even so. -Oh, Mom, not too much sugar, please. Some of us have careers that depend on how we look. -Oh, I don't know, I think you could use a few pounds. -Butter? -In the refrigerator. -So, what do you want to do about dinner tonight? -Well, actually, I'm going out. -But you have me and Thierry tonight. -Well, I have you and Thierry all day tomorrow, too. -But we've come all the way up here. -Listen, darling, I wouldn't have even accepted this invitation if I'd known you were going to show up. But you haven't for the last six weeks, so you know, it seemed really foolish to expect you. -And now that I am here, you're going out. Perfect. It's only for a few hours. It's not exactly a criminal offense. Besides, you'll have Thierry. You won't even notice I'm gone. -So are you having dinner with? Do you remember Iris Kerr? That beautiful American woman who lived in Rome? -The drunk? -Uh, I prefer to remember her beauty. -Perspective. -True. Well, it's her son and his wife. They live up here. -Tony Kerr is married? -No, it's not Tony. It's the other one. John. -Tony Kerr was the most gorgeous man I had ever met. I wanted to go to his leverage energy to him. -Hmm, did you? -Nope. He broke my heart, not my hyman. He likes boys. -Uh, where'd you get the idea? -I just started building it. -You're not worried about it collapsing or falling down? Didn't use any mortar, did you? -It's not meant to last forever, Lyle. -Ah, it's the most beautiful place on earth. -Then you should visit it more often. -I will now. -Robert seems nice. -He is nice. He's the most instinctively nice person I've ever met and he's lovely. -Is he the first since Tony? What's it like being with somebody new? I haven't had sex since I got married. I mean, I mean, with anyone other than Marian. -The first time Robert and I had sex, I wake up early in the morning, and I just watched him sleep. And I thought if you unwound this boy, you would find nothing bad, nothing rotten or unnecessary. Just everything down to the bone. Perfect and clean. -Ah, so is it romantic or just sexual? -I'm going to put you and Lyle in the yellow room. Oh, I hate to refer to rooms by the color, but it's something we do up here seeing as the rooms are different colors. -Colors. -Yellow. -This is such a beautiful room. -Thank you. -You know, in India, Hindu women often decorate their homes with brightly colored rice paste paintings in the hope of persuading the goddess of love to stop by. -Wow. Are you Indian? -My father is. He lives in Delhi. He's a counterfeitor. -Ooh, how exotic. What does he counterfeit. -Anything that will make him a lot of money. -And your mother? -Was American. She, uh, died when I wasn't much older than Rowland. -Oh, I'm sorry. -That's OK. So I went to live with my grandparents in LA when I was 10. -LA? oh my god. Ultra shock. -Well, I wasn't very happy with my father, so it's OK. I don't think he liked the way I turned out. -What, that you're a painter? -OK. -Oh. -Would you be happy if Rowland was gay? -Well, if he was happy. -You wouldn't be happy first? I mean, you'd wait for him to be happy and then you'd be happy. -I haven't really given it much thought. I think it's a bit premature. -Oh, I'm sorry. -That's all right. I'll just leave you to settle in. -Thanks. -There are times when you think no one is actually look at you when you have a quality I can only describe as sexy. Oh, god, I'm exhausted. I could fall asleep. -No! No, don't fall asleep. Talk to me. Is John a good lover? -You shouldn't ask me questions like that. -Why not? -Because. -Why are people always to reluctant to talk about sex? It's intimate, Tony. -I used to have a crush on John. -He's your brother. -I was 10. Oh, lord, well, I trust you've gotten over it. -It was just a phase. He doesn't seem sexy to me anymore. -Is Lyle a good lover? -Sex isn't a high priority with Lyle. -Is it with you? -I like sex, and Lyle doesn't? Not as much as me. -Is that a problem? -No. When I travel sometimes, I fool around. -Does Lyle know you do this? -We don't really talk about it. -Does Lyle have other lovers? -No. We're happy together. That's the important thing. -What's it like to fool around? -Why do you want to know? Deep down, you're just like me. It's the chase, not the catch. Sometimes I think I should have married you. I'm serious. I've never felt that way about anyone. Before me and Lyle, and you and John, we were lepers in the same spot. Always kissing the last person you'd expect. -Isn't there a danger that you could fall in love with one of your liaisons. And there's nothing stopping it from happening? -It doesn't happen. -No, as long as you're safe. -It's a little late for that. -What did you just say? How long have you known? -A couple of years. -Why didn't you tell me? -I decided I wouldn't tell anyone until it mattered. Except Lyle. I'm sorry. -Oh, you're healthy. -Like an ox. Or is it a horse? I can never remember. -It's a horse. I think we should go back now. -Oh, stay a bit with me. -I need a beer. Oh, you. Send Lyle with the rowboat. -Nina. -What? -Your mother. -So you're working on your book. -Oh, arranging and rearranging notes mostly. I'm writing a book about, well, I should say I'm working on a biography of my late husband. -One of her late husbands. Yes? -The latest. It's Atorian Ponti. Maybe you've heard of him. He was quite a celebrated architect. -No, I don't think so. -Not that celebrated, obviously. -Oh, the first time I saw a building he designed, I was actually speechless. The book is not going well, however. Biographies. They can make the most thrilling lives seem banal. It's just much more interesting trying to get his whole life on paper when I was-- -Giddy with widowhood? -Yes. Yes. Exactly. -May I see? -Oh, yes, please. -Do I at least rate a mention? -Oh, of course. Atorian loved you as if you were his own daughter. -Which is why he sent me away to boarding school. -Nina, you begged to go to boarding school. You said all of your friends were going. -I was 12, Mom. I also wanted to be one of Charlie's Angels. You know, she didn't even want me to call her mother in public, only Laura, as if we were friends. -Well, you never seemed particularly interested in me as a mother. I thought perhaps you'd prefer me as a friend. -I had plenty of friends. -You certainly did, and you were with them all of the time. You never even came home on vacation. -Well, I wasn't ready to be paraded around as one of your precious little accessories. -You know, about a year after she'd gone to school, Atorian and I went to a party, and someone asked how she was. And I remember thinking, oh, oh, Nina, yes, that's right. I have a daughter. I'd put her clean out of my head. -Your life. -If we expect nothing from our children, and they expect nothing from us, nobody will be disappointed. -Hmm, only lonely. -It's very beautiful. One or another is lost since we fall apart endlessly, in one motion depart from each other. -D.H. Lawrence was Atorian's favorite poet. And that so sums up the way I feel about him. At least writing about him. How are we ever supposed to know what a person's really like? Maybe it's impossible. Maybe they just keep sliding away like water changing all the time. -To be celebrated is nothing, but to be loved is everything. -Oh, my mother was less inspired when my father passed away. She sent a card. -Well, I just had so little to say about him. I mean, the whole relationship was such a whirlwind, [FRENCH] I think you say in France. -[FRENCH] yes. -A sudden, exhilarating leap into the void. -Well, I should have looked. Within a year he had me under a pedestal. And in the end, the only thing that we had in common was Nina, which, of course, made it all worthwhile. Well, I must say it was fund while it lasted. I swear he had a hand with 20 fingers, and it was always on my ass. -I was going to spend the day at Wilbur Robinson's house. And Wilbur is my best friend, and his house is the greatest place in the world to visit. It's kind of dull around here today, said Wilbur. And I looked around, Aunt Billy was playing with her train set, cousin Pete was walking the cats. And Uncle Gaston sat comfortably in the family county. -It's so odd having a child, Lyle. I keep thinking when he learns to talk, he's going to tell me everything that's on that little mind, and I'm going to know him entirely. We never know anyone like that, do we? -How well did our parents know us? -But you'll tell Mommy what you're thinking, won't you? -Don't do it. -Huh? Tell me what's on your mind? Aw, are you thinking you're stinky? Because I do. Or are you thinking you want Uncle Lyle to change your diaper, are you? -Oh, there are limits to Uncle Lyle's devotion. -Oh, actually, he's warm. Here, just run this under some cold water. Hey, honey, hey. Hey. Hey. -Here you go. -Hello, happy one. -You know, towards the end, I used to pray that Tony's illness would just turn him into a baby, and then he wouldn't know what was happening to him. -But he did. That's what he wanted. -I never knew what Tony wanted. It should be easier than changing a grown man, don't you think? -I think I'm more afraid of being sick than I am of dying. It's too abstract for me. I can't imagine dying or being dead. But I can imagine being sick. I don't mind dying, you see, it's just the preliminaries I hate. I can feel it coming, I think. -What do you feel? -Just scared. Being sick in a way that makes me feel like it's already happening. And if I died now, on a gorgeous day like today, with you here, my life would have ended well. I love you. -What are you doing in here all alone? Are you being mysterious or exclusive? -Enigmatic. -Where's Lyle? -He's upstairs asleep. It's amazing how exhausting indolence can be. And Marian? -I think she's checking on Rowland. -Tony was my half brother. We had the same mother. He used to get all the girls. The only problem was he didn't want them. Well, I'd better get cleaned up. Um, I just wanted to say that Marian and I are very pleased that you're here, Robert. And very happy to see you with Lyle. -Thanks, John. I mean, maybe it should be awkward with Robert. -Is it? -Well, I can't pretend it doesn't make me feel a little uncomfortable. This last year has been unbearable. There were times I wish I'd had the strength to commit suicide. I guess if I'd had the strength, I wouldn't have felt the need. But even at my most desperate, I always thought something wonderful my happen. It wasn't optimism. It was just a respect for the possible. And then this boy walks into my life, and I feel human again. And I just wanted to share that with you. -Well, now, I feel awful. -Good. -How could I not say anything, because that would be dishonest. And you know me too well for that. And you are my best friend. -I don't know why I always feel like whispering when I'm here. The first time I saw this place, I nearly cried. -Well, you were always more sentimental about nature than people. -Well, God is in nature. -And truth is in wine. -Thierry seems very nice. -He's married. -Oh. Well, the nicest men often are, which probably means that they aren't quite as nice as they appear. -You never let that stop you. -Did you know he was married when you first met him? -It slipped his mind. -Yeah. His wife lives in France? -Santa Monica. Yeah, it's not really a matter of distance though. It really is lovely here. -Isn't it? -You know it's beautiful in Italy, too. Have you thought any more about that offer I made you? -What would I do in Italy? -They make movies in Italy, Nina. -Yeah, in Italian. -You speak Italian. -Used to. So is, uh, Tony's brother good looking? -I don't really remember, you know. He's just very, very quiet. His personality doesn't really quite extend out to its edges. His wife speaks her mind though. -They sound awful. -No, they really aren't so bad. They're just not his type. -You sound like such a snob. -Hey, you're the one that said they sounded so awful. -Can we go back now. I think I've have enough beauty for one day. -OK. -What do you think of Robert? -He's nice enough. He's young. How are you going to cook these? -We're going to saute them. -Hmm. -I don't like him. -Why not? -Just something about him. -It must be hard for him coming up here. So well in being so closed to Tony. -Oh, I understand that. It's just, I don't buy his enthusiasm. He seems presumptuous or judgmental. -Aren't you being just a little judgmental yourself? -We can't help but form impressions of people, can we? I don't think it will last. -Well, then you should be nice. If he's just something that Lyle's going through, you probably won't have to see him again. -Yeah. -A turban? -I thought we could use a little ammunition, I hope that thing works. -Don't you have somewhere to go? -I'm Italian. I'm expected to be late. -You know, I always thought that a grudge would make a person ugly. But that isn't true in your case, is it? Strange. -You can go anyplace in the world and some things remain constant. The sun goes up, the moon comes down and children resent their parents. -You wear too much makeup, Mother. In this light, you look like a beautiful prostitute. -You know, one thing that is disturbing about children is that they can always see right through their parents. What they don't realize, is their parents can see right through them back. -Nina, take the wine. You're too much. -It doesn't matter, Thierry. I should get going anyway. -You look very beautiful. -Thank you. -Have a nice evening. -Thank you. -Hey. -Hi. -Hi. How are you? I'll be done in just a minute. -Where did Tony die? -What? -It was here in this house, wasn't it? -Robert, I don't think that's a question to really-- -True. -Robert, it doesn't matter. Of course, it fucking matters. -Robert, please. -Tell me. -Jesus. -My daughter, Nina, came up from the city unexpectedly, so it kind of slowed things down. -Hello. -Hello. -You remember my husband? -Yes, how are you? -You should have brought your daughter with you. -Yes, I-- oh, my word. What lovely paintings. -Yes, Marian painted them. -Really? Well, if you cook half as well as you paint, we're in for a rare treat. -Can I get you something to drink? -Absolutely. -Red wine? -Red, please. -OK. -Now what should we do about Nina, is it? -Oh, nothing, she's just fine. She's here with her fiance. -Well, you should have brought them both. -Why don't you give them a call? -Well, it's very kind of you, but they don't have a car, actually. -Then I'll pick them up. The more the merrier, huh? -Thank you. -Cheers. -Cheers. -Cheers. Oh, it's a wonderful house. Just wonderful. Although, it does have that renty feeling as if it suspects me of not having committed myself to it fully yet. -Well, then it must be nice for you that Nina's made it out. -Yes, it really is. Though, it's a little disturbing to have someone just for the weekend. Just beginning to enjoy their company, you turn around, and they've gone again. -More weekend guests. Sorry about that. You're really not guests, you're family. -No, I'm the guest, and I'm glad. Thank you for having me. -Well, you're welcome. Laura Ponti, this is Robert. -Hello, how are you? -Pleasure. -Lyle, nice to meet you. Laura's daughter, Nina, and her fiance are up for the evening, so John's just gone to pick them up. -[SPEAKING_FRENCH] -What happened to that martini? -Shh. -So how long are you two up for. -Just the weekend. We go back tomorrow. -Morning. -I thought we were going to have a lazy day. -I wish I could, but I have to work tomorrow evening. -Oh, it's a shame you have to go back so soon. It's such a beautiful weekend. My daughter came in from the city today, and she just practically drove me crazy with all her urban energy. -You bastard! -Be reasonable, Nina. -Reasonable? You call your fucking wife from my mother's telephone, and you've got the nerve to tell me to be reasonable? Well, you should have thought of that before you decided to spend the weekend fucking me. -Hello? Hello? -Oh, Christ. Whatever it is, I don't live here. -You must be Nina. The name's Kerr, John Kerr. -Comes the dawn. Tony's brother. -Yeah. -What does she do? -She's an actress. She's making a movie in the city. -Oh, what is it? Maybe we've heard of it. -Oh, I was afraid you'd ask me that. I haven't any idea. She does quite a lot of stuff, mostly in action and horror films, which means she has to bare her breasts before she's killed. -My wife, Marian, wanted to ask you both over for dinner. We tried to call, with the line was busy. -Well, Thierry was just leaving. -[FRENCH] -But, uh, I'd be delighted. I actually liked all of her movies. At least they weren't pornography. -Yes, at least. -Still, if they were, and she was really happy, I suppose I find some way of approving on that, too. Oh, this damn thing. -She's quite something, your mother. The way she just parked on our lawn, like she was saying, I have arrived, and I will park where I damn well please. -Please sit down, make yourself comfortable. Just throw all that stuff on the floor. It's what I do. -Is it all right to smoke in the house? -Sure. -Marian's very good at collecting interesting people. You know what the trouble with interesting people is? They make you feel dull. -Well, if you're anything like your brother, I doubt you're dull. -I'm nothing like, Tony. Although, my mother, God bless, has spent most of her life encouraging me to be. -Your mother never struck me as being particularly happy though. -No. She used to joke a lot, but I don't remember her laughing much. You know what she used to say all the time. Life's too short not to do exactly what you want. -Hmph, sounds like a threat. -No, it was meant to be. -Well, she sounds like my mother, selfish. -Yeah, but somehow she managed to turn it into charm. -Well, spoiled people are always charming. It's part of what makes us attractive. -Nina has a certain splendor about her, which is far rarer and much more delightful than common sense. I swear she could charm an angel out of its wings. -You make her sound a bit unreal. -Well, sometimes she seems that way. -Is Tony going to be there tonight? You wouldn't believe the crush I used to have on him. All he had to do was walk into a room and the walls danced, and my legs buckled. -Tony's dead. -What? -He died of AIDS last year. -Aw, I'm so sorry. -It's all right. -I can't believe it. We went to Morocco together. I spent two weeks trying to seduce him. Until I finally figured him out as far as anyone ever could. -You've no idea how many beautiful women have told me that story. -Thank you. -I see so little of her nowadays that sometimes I feel we're more like friends grown apart. -Aren't you disappointed? -No. Absolutely not. I do not allow any room in my life for disappointments. It's such a pernicious emotion. There seems to me to be such a romantic notion of family intimacy that I think is just that. I think it's a notion. Family should get together when they need to and want to just like, like friends. -But needing isn't always mutual. I mean, I know we're not obliged to love one another, but we do. It would be unnatural not to want to be close to and attend those we love. Don't you think? -That hasn't been my experience. -Sorry. It's just that it's been mine. -Then you're lucky. -Well, there's just another one of those damn notions. I mean, ideally, we should all just love one another, but family relationships do not always live up to their expectations. -So you're saying we should lower them? -If you ask me, we should get rid of them all together. -So how old were you when your parents divorced. -Uh, my mother divorced my father when I was a baby and moved to Italy. I stayed in England with my father. Tony went to live with my mother. I used to see them every summer. -So how did you end up here? -My father sent me to camp here one summer. I loved it. Pretty much didn't go back. You preferred camp to Europe? -What can I say? I'm not sophisticated. Told you I was dull. -All right. OK. -I used to imagine Tony and my mother on the beach in Italy, you know, soaking up the sun and checking out the boys. And I'd think, well, I'm not like that. Then I'd see my father sitting down to one of his fancy dinners in his London club, and I knew I wasn't like that either. -So what are you like? -Well, these days just a kid happy to be in the woods. -Oh, there's nothing so wonderful as being in love, is there? I've been in love, have loved, 11 times and have married four times. -Are you in love now? -Yes. Not with a man. And not with a woman either for that matter. I'm in love with my villa in Italy. And it's one of the best love affairs I've ever had. -I'd rather love people. -Well, that's because you're young. Young people are always in love with each other, and the world, and themselves. But when you get older, you'll find a special joy of loving a home. I mean, a home is-- it's yours. A home belongs to you. You belong to it. And it never leaves you, which is comforting. -Tony came to visit me once. -At camp? -Um-hmm. It was an absolute disaster. -Oh, why is that? He seduced one of the camp counselors. Oh, it's funny now. It was humiliating at the time. I was furious. I didn't speak to him for years after that. -Well, did you ever make up? -Yeah. You know, we wouldn't have picked one another as brothers if we'd had the choice. But I think afterward, we forgave one another for being different. We were both surprised by how much we liked each other. -Well, I never have been particularly lucky in my choice of men. They're either gay, or married. -I'm telling you, when I'm in my villa, all by myself alone at night, I feel wrapped in its arms. -Well, then to have a house full of people that you love would be ideal. -But then the house wouldn't be yours. -But wouldn't sharing make it better? -Well, would sharing Robert make him any better? No. I think we give away too much, and then we regret it. -Oh, but you can't give away too much to those you love. -Oh, well, you can only say that, because you are such a kind and really good woman. I'm not that any longer. Kindness is a quality that gets worn out with the years. It leaves you with a little patent, but it's not the real thing. That's why I like people like Robert here. Someone who desperately wants to love people instead of buildings. -Really? Most people think I'm cynical. No, judgmental. -Well, how can you live today and not be cynical unless you're an idiot. It's just an armor anyway, just covering our true selves. And I don't think it's very thick on you yet. -You look like a man about to face a firing squad. -You're right, you're right. I've always been lucky. -Oh, luck has very little to do with it. Marrying well does. -Hello. -Please, don't get up. -We, um, we started without you. -Well, I've already eaten. I'm just here for the company and the alcohol. I'll start with a beer. -So where's Thierry? -He had to go back to the city. You must be Marian. I'm Nina. -Hello. -I've heard all about you. -This is Lyle and Robert, his friend. -His lover. -What did I tell you? -What did she tell you? That all of the men that I find attractive are either gay, like these two, or Tony, or married like John. -Your mother said you were engaged. -Did she? Well, Thierry was, was being the operative word, my boyfriend. And we were saying a less than tearful goodbye when your gallant husband arrived. -Oh. -Well, maybe my gallant husband could help me in the kitchen. Gallant, my ass. -You mentioned Tony. Tony Kerr. Did you know him? -Yeah, I used to very well. We went to Morocco together. -You went to Morocco with Tony Kerr? -Yeah. When I was 18, right after boarding school. -Wait, I was there, too. -With Tony? -Did you stay at the-- -Aahana Hotel. -Yeah. -Hotel. Oh, we used to sit naked and read Joe Orton together. -Yeah. -I had no idea he had died. -Well, I hadn't either. -He died here in this house. -Oh, well, this is no topic for dinner. -No, it's fine, really. -Well, I meant-- never mind. -She look's like she just got out of the Navy the way she's looking at you. -Well, everything looks just delicious Marian. -Lyle, I was reading a review of your book in the "Times". I found it very interesting. I tried to get a copy, but the book stores up here are just hopeless. -Well, I'm sure I've got an extra copy somewhere, and I could sign it for you before you go if you'd like. -Really, that would be very nice. Thank you. -What's it called? Neo This, Neo That. -Oh, that's the story of my life. Here, to a happy weekend. -My mother's writing a book. -Really? What about? My late husband. Nina's stepfather, Atorian Ponti. -The architect? -Yes. You've heard of him? -Of course. He's one of the greatest European architects of this century. -It's a pity his work never caught on in the United States. -I guess he was just too much of a maverick. -Yes, he was a maverick. -I think he was a genius. -So do I. -I would love to read your book when it's finished. -Well, I'm afraid it's not going forward very quickly. I guess I've just bitten off more than I can chew. Atorian is so rich and contrast, it's really hard to capture him in words. -Excuse me. -Where are you going? -I left my wallet down by the wall. -Well, it's not going anywhere. -Be right back. -I don't know, pretty soon he's going to start sleeping by that damn wall. -Well, let him. One thing I've learned in my life is to let men sleep where they want to. So Robert, you don't know anything about restoration of canvases and-- -Marian did that for several years at the Met. -Really? Well, I didn't know that. That's very interesting. Have you restored old canvases and things? -Um-hmm. -How about frescoes, which is what I'm really getting at? -Only canvasses. Why do you ask? -I'm doing some work on my house in Italy. And we ran across some frescoes. They're very badly damaged, but I would love to have them restored. -That must feel like a miracle. -It does. -Just digging in the ground and there they are. -Yes. -Are they beautiful? -Oh, I think so. I mean, I don't know whether Atorian would have thought really, but I think they're very beautiful. Well, I could certainly get some names of someone if you want. I mean, you hate to go to all that trouble and have them turn out second rate. -I wouldn't want you to go to any trouble. -Oh, it wouldn't be a trouble. -Lyle, could you go see where John is. His food's getting cold. -I'll go. -Nina. -It makes much more sense if I go. I've already eaten, so which way is this, uh, wall. -You might get lost down there. I think he's created a bit of a maze. Well, I have an unerring sense of direction as long as I know where I'm going. -It's just across the lawn. There's a little pathway above the trees to the right. -Did you know the word, crochet comes from the old French word croak, meaning, say your prayers, rabbit. -Oh, no, no. It comes from the old Gaelic word [GAELIC], which means leave my ball alone you lying, cheating, sick bastard. -Can we play doubles? No, no, because then Lyle and Marian will be discussing postmodernism, and I can only take so much deconstruction in one weekend. Hmm. Sometimes I wish I'd been born lucky instead of handsome and talented. -It's funny. I always thought you were the lucky one. -Compared to you? It's all relative. -You know, you can stay here as long as you like. -Maybe it's like a vacation. -What is? You know how when you're on holiday, you pretend you're having such a great time, but then towards the end, you just, you want to get home, sleep in your own bed with your pillows. Maybe life's like that. Whoa, what hit me? -Last martini, mate. -All right. Hey. I'm poison. I'm poison. -Sorry, the door was open. -So whole circus coming, or is it just us? -It's just us. Did you make this? -Yeah. -It's amazing. -Thanks. I was just thinking what I was going to build next. Something big right out in the middle of the lake with about two feet of it sticking above the surface. -Something you can only see from below. -Yeah. -I like that. We should go back. -You just got here. Sit down. -Two people sitting side by side on a rocking good night. We're as good as guilty already. You're not dull. -Hmm. -Violence gathers in a small place. A room, a bed, a glove. -What's that? -That's the infant Jesus of Prague, James Schuyler. -I don't think I like it. -It's the most wonderful thing. -It sounds like a threat. -More like a warning. -What am I going to do with you? -Hey, what am I going to do without you? -Get on with your life. You don't need to know what you want. You just need to know what you don't want. -I don't want you to keep trying to cheer me up. -Hey. Times like this you have to figure out what it is about life that still delights you. Then grab a hold of it. Grow claws if you have to, but just don't let go. You delight me. -All the anodized aluminum, but that is if they let me. The Italian government is just impossible sometimes. You can't even clean out a closet without their permission. -Yeah, but you really got to hand to them. They've kept their country really beautiful. -Yeah, they have, haven't they? Well, I'm going to ask you something, and just answer me honestly. Are you a good painter? -I think I am. Yes. I admit I am. All right, then, I want to make you an offer. You know those I have that need restoring? Why don't you come and do them? -Oh, I, I don't really know a lot about frescoes. Oh, you can learn. I'm sure you can. I mean, I'd pay you, of course, and there's a very nice little apartment right on the grounds. -I don't know what to say. -Well, think about it. -Love at first sight. -My mother's always been a sucker for artists. -Ah, put it on your head. You'd be Carmen Miranda. -Too beautiful to eat. -Oh, Robert. Here. They're grape scissors. We use them to cut a bunch. Take a branch and cut the stem like this. Not difficult. -Go ahead, Robert. -Oh, for heaven's sakes, don't tame him. Let him eat grapes with his fingers if he wants to. Let's all rid ourselves of these ridiculous, ridiculous, ridiculous affectations. -They were my grandmothers. -I didn't mean any harm. -That's when you usually do the most damage. -I'll go talk to her. -No, no. I, I've broken something here. It's up to me to put it right. Oh, dear. -I'm going for a walk. -I'll come with you. Marian, I am so sorry. -I'm sorry. -Oh, no, you have nothing to be sorry about. I just, I know you want this to be a special evening, and I've gong and spoiled it. -Laura-- -I'm really sorry. -You didn't spoil it. I spoiled it. Gloriously. Where's Jonathan? -He's outside with Nina. And Lyle, and Robert. -OK. -One night's good food and wine, tears, laughter. Summer casts a spell on all of us, Marian. Oh, come on. -One of my mother's more restrained moments. Well, I guess Tony was here tonight after all. Why, if you, if you were dead would you ever choose to hold. -I didn't know you smoked. -I used to smoke, all the time. -In the good old days? Before dinner, I overheard John and Marian talking about us. They don't think I'm right for you. They think it won't last. -People conjecture about relationships all the time. It doesn't necessarily mean they're right. -So you think they're wrong? You think I'm right for you? -Look, you're still not upset about the grape scissors, are you? -All I'm asking is can you imagine our relationship developing? Can you imagine us loving one another, because I can. -Robert, I'm fond of you. This isn't about love. -Well, if you don't love, why did you tell me that you did? -Robert, there are times one could be forgiven for not speaking the literal truth when one's-- -Fuck this one stuff. And if you think that I'm going back there, you're fucking crazy. -You know, one of these days, life is going to present both of us a bill. I'm not sure either one of us are going to be able to pay up. -Oh, please. There is a lot more bothering Marian than me flirting with her husband. And I don't think throwing the grape scissors did too much for her equilibrium. -No, but I did apologize. -Well, maybe you shouldn't have. If I was Robert, I would have hit her. -You know, people only humiliate each other when they're afraid. -And what are we afraid of? -Us? -Yeah. -Each other. -Oh, Jesus, watch out! -Lyle, what are you doing? Where's Robert? -He went back to the house. -I couldn't hear. -Look, uh, sorry about the thing with the grape scissors. -I thought it was pretty rude. -No, Marian wasn't, didn't mean to be rude. Robert just didn't understand. -She'll apologize in the morning, I'm sure. Your face is cut. You have blood all over. What-- -No, I'm all right. -What happened? -I fell down and I broke my glasses. I can't really see without them. Robert's not really at the house. -What? -We had a fight, and he ran off into the woods to look for the train station. -He didn't do this? -No. -Look, I'd better get you back in the house. I'll go look for Robert. If he wants to leave, I'll take him to the station in the morning. Come on. -What the fuck was I doing? I mean, what business did I have bringing him here? -Business. -Then, why do we invest in them? Why do we spend our whole lives trying to get something out of them? -Some of it's done. -I was betraying him. Your brother. -I don't know. This doesn't look very promising. Listen, why don't you change your mind and come on over to my house and spend the night. -She makes a terrific breakfast. -Yes, I really do, and it's freezing to death out here. Come on. -Thanks, but I think I prefer to stay here at the station. -Oh, maybe you shouldn't have pressed Lyle. -You know, I thought he'd answer differently. -Yeah. -At least, I hoped he might. -Hope can be very intimidating to a lot of people. Especially to people like Lyle and me, who don't have a whole lot left. -Hey, I didn't know what you were doing with him in the first place. -You know, I think that mourning should be taken as an aphrodisiac. No, I simply mean that I don't think it should be an excuse for you not to fall in love again. Still, it can be very difficult when it fizzles again, especially when you're young and have no perspective. -I have my own perspective. -Oh, of course, you do. That was so smug of me. No, no. I just sometimes, I think, because I've been asked questions, I know all the answers. I'm really sorry. -No, I think you're wonderful. You're smart. You're funny. And nice. -Thank you. -Your welcome. -Listen, let me give you my card. I'll be in Italy in September. Now, whatever you decide, you know? Keep in touch. I mean, if it's only to let me know that the train came. I will. -Ciao. -Ciao. -You really should go, you know? It's Italy. My mother's got a lot of maternal instincts she needs to express. It might as well be to you. -Why not you? -It takes time and effort, selflessness. Something we both lack in spades. Promise me you'll go. -OK. -Thank you. Good night, Robert. [KNOCKING] -Lyle. [KNOCKING] -Lyle? -Yes. -Is everything all right? I saw John drive away. -Laura Ponti left her house keys here. -Oh. I didn't hear the phone. -Maybe John found them, and then called her. I'm not sure which, but he said to be right back. -He's probably on one of his drives. Did you and Robert have a nice walk? -Yes. Good night, Marian. -Night. Night Robert, and sorry about the grape scissors. -Marian, this is Laura. I'm sorry to be calling so late, but I just thought you would like to know that I dropped Robert off at the station. -I thought Robert was here. Why would you drop him at the station? -Well, that's where he wanted to go. Would you tell Lyle that I called, because Robert really wanted him to know that he was all right. And Marian, thank you again for a lovely dinner. Good night. -Good night. -What's going on? Laura Ponti just called, and said that she dropped Robert at the station. -Oh, she found him. Good. -Good. What's good? What's going on, John? -Robert and Lyle had a fight. Robert ran off. Lyle walked into a tree. -But he's OK. -He cut his face. And he's upset. -So where have you been? -I went to look for Robert. -Hmm. Well, Lyle said that you'd gone to drop off Laura's keys that she had left from here. Why would he lie to me? -Maybe he was embarrassed. -Well, so we were right about the two of them. -God, Marian. You sound so mean. -Oh, shit. -Morning. -Ouch! That's got to hurt. -Actually, It's not so bad. I'm feeling quite butch. Well, I do have no idea why they call them black eyes. -You mean the color blue. Did I wake you? -No, I couldn't sleep. Checking for the damage. -Just because you can't see doesn't me it's not there. -What's this? It's Robert's chair. -It's lovely. -May I ask you something? -Of course. -Did you like Robert? -Nope. I didn't get a chance to know him before he ran off. -He kind of got the feeling you didn't like him. -That's a shame. -Actually, he overheard you telling John you didn't like him. -Why did you do that to me? -What? -Ask me a question when you knew the answer? -I wanted to see what you'd tell me. -Well, you didn't think I'd tell you the truth? -Marian, yesterday you told me you liked him. -Well, maybe yesterday I liked him Lyle, but I'm not going to sit and make a judgment on whether I like a person or not based on what? A couple of hours in their company? -Oh really, see, that's exactly what he thought you did. -What? He ran off because Marian didn't like him? -Knew you didn't like him. -Well, I'm sorry that he overheard a conversation that he-- -Don't be sorry, Marian. -Why? It's my fault. Isn't that what you're saying? -Jesus Christ, your fault, you, all your fault. No, it's not your fault. He didn't leave because he thought you didn't like him. He left, because he thought I didn't like him. He wanted me to tell him that I loved him. I couldn't. So he panicked, and he ran away. -Well, he's well. -Some of us are just better at hiding it than others. -Lyle, you don't run off in the middle of the night just because someone doesn't say I love you. -Really? Brilliant. I didn't know that. I liked him. I liked him a lot. -Did Lyle say what the argument with Robert was about? -Robert overheard me telling you I didn't like him. -Oh. -Do you really think I'm mean? -You're a fine person, Marian. What did Lyle really say to you? -It's about me. Hey. Oh. Did Mommy upset you, too? There Mommy. There Mommy. -Anything interesting in the "Times". -One laugh after another. -Why is it that you look the best in the peace and quiet that follows a violent storm? -Well, I am something of a season campaigner. What's up? -My schedule. We're going to Toronto on Thursday. -Oh, well, will you have any spare time? I mean, you could stay up here a few days. Thierry, too, of course, if you'd like. -The only place I'll be seeing Thierry is at the set. -Oh. I'm sorry. -No, you're not. He was just another way of punishing you, and hurting myself. And I think it's about time I stopped doing both of those things. -That would make me very happy. Listen, um, I didn't misbehave too badly last night, did I? -No, half the time you were charming. -And the other half? -You thought you were charming. You loved Atorian very much, didn't you? -As much as you loved your father. Well, they're still alive in our dreams, aren't they? -Yeah. -It's better going back to the city than leaving it don't you think? Lyle? It's comforting traveling in the same direction as the river. -Hmm. -I do feel awful about what happened with Robert. When the two of you came here to stay, you were both so happy. I wasn't nice to him. -No. It wasn't about Robert. It was about Tony. -I know. -Mourning should sooth the objects, not the subjects. -And I don't mourn Tony well. -Neither do I. Will you invite Robert back? Do you want me to call him? -I will. -OK. -That's us. Well, me. -Are we still friends? -Of course, we are. -OK. -Lyle. In your life, love never gets expressed directly. You get in touch with your emotions, and then you run away from them. -But you know I love you. -It shouldn't require so much effort on my part. Promise me things will be different. After. -I don't want there to be an after. -Promise. -There are things you lose you don't ever get back. You can never have them again except in the smudging carbon copy of memory. There are things that seem irreconcilable that you must find a way to reconcile with. The simple passage of days dulls the sharpness of the pain, but never quite wears it out. And it doesn't get washed away in time. It becomes a cold hard lump of something. And a loseable souvenir. Tony told me once. There's no future in holding on to the past.
