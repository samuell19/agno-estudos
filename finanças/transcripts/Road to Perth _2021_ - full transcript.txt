This is Eric, the photographer. Nice to meet you. Take a seat, please. And the other talent just got here. - She's in hair and makeup. - Okay, great, thank you. - Here we go. - Great. Okay. Thanks. Alright, here we go. Look right to me, please. Great. Thanks. You know what? Look to the right. Hey, this is Alex. Sorry, I missed your call. Go ahead and leave a message and I'll get back to you when I can. Thanks. Hey, I just got a text from Lisa. Let me just read it to you. "I think you need to call your brother. He'll probably explain more but I'm pretty sure he went to Australia by himself." Can you just call me when you land or whatever? Okay. Bye. Hello. Hey. What are you doing here? Um, have you heard from her? She said the trip was canceled and that you proposed to her. Look, could I just come in? Uh, yeah. Tea? No, thanks. I'm good. So I've got this bed in the spare room set up inside and it's all... Uh, the sheets are all clean... I thought you were both coming. And then the room next to this room is full of towels... Did she say anything at all about me? Anything? Lisa's one of my best friends, so, of course, I'm going to be on her side. I have to be. You've got other places that you can stay, right? Yeah, I'll be out of here tomorrow. Don't worry. I don't really know what to do with him here. I mean, I can't believe he actually came here without you. I'm so sorry again. No, it's fine. I think I can handle it. Let me know how it goes, okay? What do you want me to do again? I want you to stand over there by the fence and I'm going to take your picture. No, the other part. Well, let's just get set up, first. Come on. Mm. Come on. I want you to stand here... And look in the camera and tell me what city we're in and what's so great about this place. - Why? - Well, that's what she was supposed to do but she's not here, so. Smile. We're in Rye. It's on the coast. It's a bit cold at the moment, as you can see. And I just recently moved here. I don't know anything about Rye. The end. Uh, just lie to me, tell me something a little bit more. It's got a beautiful beach nearby. That's why I bought the place. Are we done? Perfect. You're a crazy person. Hey, what's up, man? Can I just get a beer? Thanks. Perfect. Thanks, man. She can go and go fuck herself. - You can't say that. - She, she... Yes, I can! And she needs to know... She needs to know, if she ever wants you back, nah, you're not havin' her. Fuck her. Nah. Nah. That's easier said than... So yes, that's my brother. No. Tell her, "Go away. You lost me. You had your chance. - Fuck off now." - I wouldn't say that... - Says you! - I can't say that to her. You've got a wife now that's devoted to you for 12 years... - Hey, what's up? - Uh, sorry. I've been... I've been trying to get a hold of you this whole time but I finally just got service to be able to send you a video. So check out this place that I'm staying in. Wait, how drunk are you right now? - What? - Wait, where are you? Uh, I am in this weird motel/pub. There's a pub downstairs here and there's like, two hotel rooms, or two rooms just around the corner here. This is the blue room. This is where I'm staying. I met this guy downstairs. His name is John. And he said that he conceived his son - in that room... - Okay. Can you stop for a second? Just stop, please. Did you hit your head? Are you in shock? No. I mean, I got, you know, a couple beers deep with the guys downstairs. They were giving me shit because I told them that I was going to come talk to you. And then they're like, "Why the fuck are you trying to talk to your sister? You're with a bunch of guys." But this is the, uh, the green room, right here. If you want to take a look at that. It looks like a rain forest or something. But yeah, I'm doing good and I miss you. Can you just tell me that you have some sort of plan for where you're going and you're not just roaming wildly... Hey! We need another stand. Okay, one second, please. 'Kay, Alex, I have to go but you need... Rach, I've got it figured out. Oh, you do. Okay. Well. Yes, I have a friend that I'm supposed to meet up with. - What friend? - This guy? Mackie... I met with him a few years back on a forum. Forum, like an internet thing? Oh my God. Okay. Jesus, I can't with you right now. I have to go. Please don't die. Love you. - Hi. - We've been waiting. Sorry about that. I, um, I'll get you the stand right now. Okay? Thank you for your patience. All right, so, tell me your name, what city we're in and what's so great about this place. Sweet. Now I'm talking to the fucking koala. You're kidding me? Come on. Shit. Hey, this is Lisa. Sorry, I couldn't take your call right now. If you just send me a text or leave me a message, I will be sure to get back to you as soon as possible. Okay. I'll talk to you later. Hey. Um, it's me. I, uh, I figured I'd give you a call. I dunno. I just wanted to hear your voice. And I know, it's like 6:00 in the morning there. So I figure you're asleep but I just wanted to get your voicemail. Uh... I'm staying in this place in the countryside about 45 minutes away from Adelaide. And it's solar powered, so I currently don't have any light. I really don't know what I'm doing here. But, I just wanted to call you and... tell you that I'm okay. Hello? Hey, Mackie. Hey. Uh. Yeah, it's... It's Alex. No, uh, Alex. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, man. Uh, no, no. It's totally cool. Um, so listen, I'm actually like 45 minutes outside of Adelaide. Yeah, yeah. Well, yeah, I was just wondering if maybe you wanted to, I don't know, grab a beer later. I'm going to be down that way, so... Wait, what? You want me to... Are you serious? You want me to pick her up? But I, I don't know where the airport is. But yeah, I guess I could look it up. What time does she get...? I'll tell you what, I'll... Yeah, I'll go get her. I'll just give you a call when I pick her up then. Is that okay? Okay, cool. Uh, well, yeah man, it's... Oh. Hello? Awesome. So we are in Adelaide. We are in the Slick Lobster Barbershop. And what's unique about Adelaide is we're kind of like a big country town: Everybody kind of knows each other. There are a lot of creative people doing cool things and we all get to experience those cool new things as kind of like a small community. We got good food, we got good coffee, we got good wine and we all get to celebrate and enjoy and partake of what is going on in the city as it grows. It's exciting to be in Adelaide at the moment. Hey. Uh, so I'm pulling up right now. I'm in a grey car. Do you... Do you see me? Oh, well, what are you, what are you wearing? Oh, yeah, okay. Definitely see you. Do you see me? I'm in the grey car, I'm waiting. - Hey. - Hey. How's it going? I'm Alex. Oh, you can just drive. You don't need to be my friend today. Okay. Shit. Sorry. Shit. Shouldn't drive with your phone on. Sorry. It's... Jesus. Sorry. It's my sister. She keeps trying to call me. How was, how was the flight? Um, yeah, it was fine. There's a lot of people out there. Um, yeah. Yeah, it's an airport. Are you hungry? Probably can get some food. No, I'm good thanks. Just, get where we're going. Why have we stopped? I have no idea where we're going. How's that? I've never been here before in my life. I... - You don't have the address? - No, I thought you had it. I don't. Just get some forward motion. That'd be good. Okay. You're going to need to turn around. Yup. Yeah, I'm here now. No, they didn't even know to expect me. Because you were supposed to come here with me. That's the thing; they're expecting you. Well, I don't know what I'm supposed to do now. How do you expect me to get to Perth? Well, I don't know, man. This is what you were supposed to organize. Fuck. Between you and mum, like, I just don't... Yeah, that fucking random guy. I don't know... How do you even know him? I don't know what you're expecting me to do now. Like, you completely screwed me. Fine. Fuck. Fuck you, too. Is that a coffee tin? - It's my father. - What? Um. Dementia mainly. Cancer eventually. Damn. What about Mackie and your mom? What's going on with your mom? It's not something I think we should talk about if you want me to remain pleasant. I mean, like we can but I'm not going to be nice. Okay. Has anyone ever called you abrasive? Like, to your face? Have they said that to you? Well, what about you? You don't seem so terribly affected by my abrasiveness. Well, no, it's because I'm the exact same. I keep drinking and talking to you all night, I mean, I'll be standing on top of tables, just yelling at people and hiding in the corner, crying my eyes out by myself. It's not pretty either. Not a pretty crier. Totally. - You'd cry? - Mm. Yeah. - Men don't cry. - Mm-hm. I can cry. I can cry. Yeah. But you don't, you don't talk about the things that make you want to cry, right? Do you? - Thank God. - What? I actually have power. So you've just been staying at random people's places between Melbourne and here? Yeah. Why? Poor life choices. I'll take the couch. Morning. Hi. Hey! Good morning. How'd you sleep? Yeah. Good, thank you. Um, I'm so sorry about yesterday. I didn't mean to ruin your holiday. Oh no, it's fine. Are you gonna bounce? Yeah, I've got to go. Look, I... I wanted to apologize. I didn't mean to treat you like one of Mackie's minions. Huh. You're dealing with a lot of shit. - I get it. - Cool. Well, thanks. Oh, wait. Um. Uh, what are you doing? I was going to take a little road trip with my brother but he blew me off, so I'm going to go figure that out. How far is it? It's like a day trip out of the city. I could do a road trip. Uh. Okay. I'll be downstairs. Fuck. We're in Quorn in South Australia's Flinders Ranges. Quorn's a very historic town. We've got fantastic traditional old streetscapes in our community and we're a service center for most of the Flinders Ranges, which is one of South Australia's most beautiful parts. Guy said there's like some cellar down here that we should check out. Mm... no... Whatever. So you just, um, ask people questions and take their photograph? Yeah. I ask for their name. And what city they're in and I don't know, what's so great about the place. Is that something you came up with? Uh, no, my girlfriend did. Why are you putting it in your pants? Mm, keep it warm. You want a coffee? No. Thanks. Hey, uh, is the cellar down here? Yeah mate, It's over here. Just down the stairs. - Alright, thanks man. - No worries. I am not going down there. Yeah, you are. Come on. Look at this. What? You get scared? No. You get scared a little bit. Holy sh... Oh my God, no. Come on, come on. Dad? Look at this. You gotta go in the dark. You left your baby here, too. Is it a bo... Yup, it's a boy. Let's go. She's my ex-girlfriend. Ex-girlfriend. Not girlfriend. What? The photo idea I was talking about earlier, said it was my girlfriend's idea? It was my ex-girlfriend's idea. So why are you doing it? Actually, I don't even know what you call it. What do you call it when you propose to somebody and they said no? I think you say, "I never want to see you again," and then you never see her again. I hadn't really thought about that one. I haven't felt so far from home in my entire life. Quorn. Big Fan of Quorn. Quorn. How'd you find out about this place, anyway? My father grew up here. Oh, wow. Ah, geez. This is just the first stop. Sorry. What now? Wanna get some food? I'm gonna go to Perth. Scatter my father's ashes along the way. There's more of him left in there? Yeah. How are you going to get there? You don't even have any money, do you? I can take you. Why would you do that? I'm not ready to go back yet. - Okay. - Okay? Okay. It's nice. Fuck me. Yeah, we're going to need to get some food. And coffee. - Alex? - Hey! Good, you're alive. No, I know, sorry. It's just been, uh, been out of service for a couple of days. It's hard, you know, between these cities and stuff. Are you having fun at least? Yeah. Listen, you remember that... You remember that guy that we were talking about - the other day from the... - The internet? Yeah. Sure do. What about him? Well, I'm going to be driving his sister. - To Perth. - What? Why would you be driving his sister to... Why isn't he doing that? I... You're going to... Where even is... How far is Perth from where you are right now? It's, uh, a bit more west. Like, 2,000 K's... - As in kilometres? - Uh, kilometres. - With some random girl, Alex. - It's not random. I've known her for like two days. She's not bad. She's actually pretty nice. I'll introduce you. Oh my God. Well, I don't know. She's got some stuff she's got to deal with. It's really not that big of a deal, but listen... What about Lisa? You haven't even told me what's going on with you and Lisa. She's supposed to be there with you and I don't know - why she's not... - I'm not ready for that yet. So I just need you to give me some time. Okay? Okay. I'll give you some... I... yeah, sure. I'll give you time but can you please just promise to call me along the way? No, look, just, I'll call you in a couple of days and, uh, don't worry about it. It's gonna be fine. All right? Okay. Bye. Shit. Is everything okay? On the phone? Sounded like you having a pretty, um, heated discussion. Oh no, it was fine. Was that your, your ex-girlfriend? Uh, no, that was my sister. - Oh, okay. - Yeah. She was just calling to make sure everything is all right. - Yeah, right. - Checking in. Cool. - You guys are close? - Yeah. She's a couple of years older than me so - she just likes to keep tabs. - Right. It's just the two of us, so I don't really blame her. Your parents separated, or...? Nah, they were together for a while. My dad died when I was, like, six. So, you probably know just about him as much as I do. - You ever been out here before? - Never. Why not? I don't know. I didn't think there was anything worth coming here for, I guess. You don't think that's worth coming for? Look at that. Yeah, now that I'm here, but I didn't know it existed. How far do you think that is? What? Like, to the end of the horizon. Well, it's endless. That's why it's called a horizon, just keeps going and going. Yeah, and that's not possible. You gotta get to the end, somewhere. That's, that's wrong. That's impossible. There is no end. It just continues to go on. Like, you'll get to that where you can see now and then they'll be more like those continue. Didn't they teach you that in school? - Nice. - Yup. Take that one. So, I guess we can check it out tomorrow, if you wanna backpack in the morning. You have a missed call. What the hell is out there, I mean? Dude, I have no idea where the hell we're at - right now, actually. - We're in the Nullarbor. - Yeah? - Yeah. What's that? It's this desert region that we're in right now. You don't know what it is, do you? It's an iconic piece of Australian land where the desert meets the ocean, it's really beautiful. It sounds lovely. Well, my dad loved it here. He used to stop off when he'd drive from Adelaide to Perth. I think he liked how big and empty and desolate it is. Beautiful too, though. I'm gonna take a shower. Hey. Don't call her. Hello? Hi, beautiful. I can put my dick in other people, yeah? Hey. Hello? Lisa? Who is this? No, hang on. We're gonna do this. He's not understanding what I'm saying. What did you just say? Who is this? Is everything okay? Who is this? We need to see what we both likeable and learn from it. What the f... Some guy was on the phone? - What guy? - I don't fucking know. What's he say? Hey, this is Lisa. Sorry I... Fuck. Who is it...? I don't know. Sorry. Amazing, isn't that? You're making me nervous. Come back... please. Reckon anyone's ever fallen off? You scared? Yeah. You eat the rest of that and you're gonna get sick. Making pretty good time. Kangaroos have started to come out, look. Think we'll stop somewhere tonight and then head on down to Esperance tomorrow. Sound good? There's this um, there's this lake there that is hot pink. I really want to go and see it. I've seen it in photos and stuff, but never in real life so it would be... Pretty cool, I think. It's like a natural phenomenon. Um, the... The salt, I think, affects the color and makes it this like, really bright, almost like a cotton candy pink. Reckon my dad'll like it there. Probably stopped there on his way through. Can you pull over? Can you pull over right here? You okay? Yeah. Can you just pull over right here? Ugh. Fuck. Mum. It's Ronnie. Yeah, I'm gonna, I'm gonna be in town in a couple of days, I've got dad. Okay. Well. Do with that what you will. Yeah. All right. Hello? Alex? Sorry, who's this? Um, Lisa. Uh, Alex's girlfriend. Uh, he can't come to the phone right now. Look, there was a call last night that might have been taken the wrong way. And I don't know what Alex heard but it's not what he probably is thinking it is. If you could just pass that on to him, I'd appreciate it. Hello? Alex? Gotcha coffee. How's your stomach feeling? Good, great actually. Good. It's possible Lisa's been cheating on me. I don't know, I think I'm okay with it. You think you're okay with her cheating on you? I mean, I'm okay that it's over. It's been pretty rough for a while now, anyway, so. It is what it is. Yeah? Yeah. Damn. Not bad. Wow, this is really nice. Yeah. Not bad. Huh. Probably get your own room. Definitely smells better. Hm. Hey. You alive in there? Yeah. Should I come in? I'll be a minute. It's nice to have a good bed for a change. Yeah, for sure. Smile. We're in Esperance, Western Australia. It's a great place because we've got the whitest beaches in the world, the beautiful wildlife in the ocean, fishing, yachting, boating, it's all at your doorstep. Within five minutes, we can be on the best beaches in the world. It's not really that pink, is it? I've seen the pictures. It's called Pink Lake. Sure is. It looks a little bit different than the pict... Are we definitely at the right one? It says the actual Pink Lake is on an island. No way. Yeah... Why the fuck would they say this is Pink Lake if the actual Pink Lake is on an island? I don't know. Maybe we can take a ferry. No, that's bullshit! I came here for a Pink Lake. - Where am I supposed to put my dad? - Fuck... I don't know, we can figure something out. Kay, well, thanks for calling. Yeah. - You okay? - Yeah. How much further do you have? Uh, it's about an eight hour drive to Perth. Is she getting her stuff figured out? It's getting there. We've been... scattering her dad's ashes across the desert. I don't know. It's been good for me. To be here with her. Uh... Do you know when you're going to be home yet? I haven't really looked at flights yet, but probably Wednesday. Okay. Do you need anything? Like, is there anything I can do? No. Well, do you have enough money to come back? Yeah, I'm fine, Rachel. Do you? I'm sorry. Don't be. This is something that had to happen. I get it. I'd probably do the same thing. Yeah. Are you falling in love with this girl? Are you going to come back married? I'll try not to. Okay, good. How are you? Things are good at work. They gave me a number. I went by the studio. What? Rach, that's incredible. Mm. Yeah, we'll see. Okay, uh, it's early here but just keep me posted, okay? Okay. I love you. I love you. Alright, bye. Alright. I know I'm being silly. Sorry to drag you all the way out here. It's alright. This was supposed to be a big family trip but... Your family's full of shit bags? Yeah. Here you are. Australia's finest bottle of wine. You like it? Straight from a gas station. How much do you want? Is that good? Um, yeah. This doesn't have to be awkward. I could live with that. Yeah? No Cocklebiddy, though. Mm. Uh, there's this thing called, "Arena football," which is a condensed version of American football where it's in a smaller field but it's indoors. And I always had a huge crush... Wow, look at that. It's beautiful. I had a huge crush on this girl. She was my girlfriend. I was 12 years old. And at the end of this arena football game, I go down to the 50 yard line and it took me four times to give her like, a little... Like, a little peck on the mouth because every time I did it, in her ear I like whispered, "I love you..." And then when it came to me actually having to kiss her, I... My like, heart stopped and I like, ran away. So my first kiss was with a boy, and we were about 11 or 12, 12, I wanna say. And we went down to the beach with... This is when I lived in Lake Byron Bay, near Byron Bay, - Mm hm. - and we went down to the beach - with a group of friends, - Steamy. Like after school and everyone was like, daring us to kiss. Um. And I was really embarrassed that everyone was gonna be watching, so I said, "I'll only do it if like, people hold up towels around us..." So no one sees us kiss. What's... Is that the worst make out you've ever had? Shit. It's closed. Yeah, the pumps are locked. Lights are off in there? - Yeah. - Yeah, it's definitely closed. It's about two hours 'til Perth. - Yeah, we should be fine on gas. - Okay. If I was you, I'd just book us a room. Uh, yeah. Actually um... What? You already got us a room? Well, I'm going to stay with a friend. Damn. Sorry, Alex. - I didn't mean... - Damn. It's right here. Thank you. It's not you. Can I... see you tomorrow? Yeah. Hey. Your bags are still in the back. Look in the camera and tell me what city we're in, and what's so great about this place. Okay, so we're in Perth, Western Australia. Even though we're the most isolated city in the world, the thing I love the most about Perth is our beautiful beaches. We have the best beaches in the world. Uh, but it's beautiful. We have the best weather. It's quite small. We're currently in an area of Perth called Leederville. And yeah, one of the, one of my favorite hangouts, um, since I was little, so welcome to Perth. - Hey! - Hi. - How's it going? - Good. How was your night? Yeah, it was fine. How about you? It was good. So, where are we going? It's a surprise. It's right here. That's it. This one. - Wait, that's your mom's house? - Yeah. Jesus. Mackie makes complete sense to me now. I'll be a sec. Keep the car running. Oh, shit. Go, go, go, go, go! You gave her the whole thing? It was empty. She doesn't get to keep him. What are you going to do when you get back to L.A.? I dunno. Decompress? Clear my head for a little bit. But... But what? Wow. What were you going to say? I've been irresponsible and reckless. The rent-a-car place probably thinks that I jacked their car. Do you think I'd get a free flight if I got deported? Poor life choices. A little bit to the left. I wish you'd take more ownership over this. Perfect. What? When I first met you, you said this was Lisa's idea. Just one more step to the right... She's not even here. You're the one who's doing all the hard work. Just a little bit to the right. Perfect. She says, "Hi," by the way. What? She called. Lisa. The answer to your question is no. What question? Are you going to get back together with Lisa? Alright. So. Where are we at? And what's so great about this place? I don't know where we're at. And I don't know what I like about it. Should we head back? Thank you... I like this guy. Which one? Oh, yeah. Yeah, he's a legend. He's the mayor. - The mayor? - Yeah. I also did some interviews too, if you think you could use them. Yeah, we could do like an audio installation, something like that. Could be really cool. Wasn't really planning on doing anything with this. Wasn't exactly my idea. This is her, right? Think you're going to go visit her? I have no idea. I haven't really thought about it yet. Mm-hm. I'm gonna get a coffee. You want one? No. Love you.
