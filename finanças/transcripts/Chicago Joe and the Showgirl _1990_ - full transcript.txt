It seems that every star in the Hollywood firmament has come out to shine on this glittering occasion-- the world premiere of Georgina Grayson's sensational new movie, Goodbye, My Lovely. A packed crowd of her adoring fans have been waiting for hours just to catch a glimpse of the lovely Georgina. The air is-- is electric here. And here she is, ladies and gentlemen! Here she is, the star of Goodbye, My Lovely, Georgina Grayson! She looks magnificent. And ladies, you'll be interested to know she's wearing a turquoise lamé evening gown with matching jacket and fur-trimmed cuffs. If only you could be here, ladies and gentlemen. If you could just see this. She looks out of this world. Georgina, Georgina, just a word for your millions of fans. Ladies and gentlemen, miss Georgina Grayson. So who's in it? What, the ball? No. The movie. Who's my leading man? Is it Raft or is it Cagney? Oh, yes, it's Raft. Oh, well, it'll be a gangster movie. What a shame. A shame? Well, they're too violent for me. I like a nice musical. Musicals are just make-believe, but gangster pictures are real life. The car's on seventh Avenue. Look, I told you twice already, there's gonna be a guy in the back of the building there to meet you. Not on the phone, you idiot. Just like the poster says-- careless talk costs lives. You know the stuff's in the cellar. Take it straight to the warehouse. Oh, yeah, don't use Joey as a lookout. He spends most of his time looking for broads than he does cops. Yeah, bye. Thanks, Chicago. Any chance of some new nylons, Lenny? See what I can do, Georgina. That's a friend of mine, Georgina. Is it? Yeah. He's known around the Broadway as Chicago Joe. Then he's a long way from home. Boys are going shopping tonight. Sounds tasty. Anything special? I think it's a little out of your league, Lenny, unless you can afford 100 cases of the best scotch. No, you're right. Too rich for me, Chicago. How can you lay your hands on that much stuff? You gotta remember I was trained by Capone during prohibition. We used to move more than 10,000 cases a night. Why did you do that? It was uncomfortable in my back. It's not as near as uncomfortable as a knife in the neck. Do me a favor, Chicago. Put it away. Who's the girl? Her? That's Georgina Grayson. Georgina? That's a nice name. Yeah, it's her stage name. She's an actress? Dancer. She tells me, uh, some big-time producer's offering her a screen test sometime next month. A movie star. So you're really somebody famous? Depends what you mean by famous. All those medals. I bet you've seen some action. Yeah. This one here I got for fighting in Norway. This one I got for jumping in Normandy. This one right here I got for a little excitement in Arnhem. Oh? I was wondering if you'd be interested in going for a ride with me later on tonight. I've got a very important date tonight. Yeah, I bet. I mean, a girl like you, you're bound to have a boyfriend, right? Perhaps some other time. Yeah. Maybe some other time. We'll see you around, Georgina. See you. The show ends at midnight, Broadway picture palace. Yeah, I'll bet it does. Hammersmith Broadway at midnight. What a silly place to meet someone. I can take care of myself. Well, if you are going to have a night on the town, I've got something here that might come in useful. Oh, evening in Paris. Oh, my favorite. Where did you get it? Never you mind. Just don't use too much. Mrs. Evans, thank you. Lovely. Oh, well, someone's got to look after you. You sure you know what you're doing? Why couldn't he meet you earlier? You could get your throat cut. What, by an American officer? Don't be silly. What you got cooking, good-looking? Did somebody steal your Buick? Thought I'd missed you. Yeah, and I thought you stood me up. Another minute and I would have been indoors. You're lucky. I usually am. Do you always ride around in a truck this size? It gets me where I want to go. It's great. You got enough room for a regiment in the back. Hey, come here. You see this truck? What about it? It's stolen, and I stole it. So come on. I dare you. You can't drive around London in a Buick. People start asking questions. But you drive around in a 2 1/2 ton army truck and you're invisible. It's just you and me, honey. Anywhere special you want to go? Anything you want to do? Yeah. I'd like to do something really dangerous. Dangerous? Yeah, like flying a bomber over Germany. Can you see the air force giving me a plane? Men, they get all the action. I'd like to see some as well. In fact, I'd like to be involved in some real danger. Oh, yeah? Like what? What I'd really like to do... Is be your gun moll. Okay, who you been talking to, huh? Huh? Someone's been telling tales outside of school. I don't like that. Okay? See this gun? This gun is real special. There's only 12 in the whole world. They're made for the man in Chicago. He gave this one to me personally. Think you can handle it? Yeah. Ever use one before? Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. What are you doing in England? Boss had a brainwave, take over the limey rackets. He used his influence to get me posted here. I run the London end of his operation. When this little excitement in Europe is over-- no. This is a real gun. It fires real bullets... Which make... Real holes. See, where I come from, we'd just as soon kill a man as we would take out our garbage. Give me a chance, Chicago. I'll prove i-- hey, hey. Don't ever, ever, call me Chicago. Not even when we're alone, okay? As far as you're concerned, I'm second lieutenant Ricky Allen. Okay, honey? Could we pull a job together? You bet we can. Say, Georgie, what time is it? Nearly 1:00. My boys just knocked over a warehouse. Stole their entire stock of spirits. Say, Georgie... How'd you like a fur coat? That's what I've always wanted. Well... Fox, chinchilla, mink-- you just name it. That one! I want one just like that. That's gorgeous. You got it. Oh, help me! Help me! Help me! Aah! Aah! There's probably only enough here to make a pair of gloves. Where's the rest of it? Still on that woman. Goddamn it. I know there's a war going on and all, but where's the quality gone, huh? Where's the class? You've got more class than any 10 men I know. Say, you know how to drive? You're joking. First time I went in a private car was when... Was...was on my 24th birthday. Hmm. That's too bad. All gun molls got to know how to drive. I guess this is where you learn. Okay, now step on the gas faster. Yeah. Now push in the clutch. Ready... Go. Aah! Look at that. Wow. Oh, my god. Aah! Aah! So when can I meet you again? Soon, but you probably won't know you've met them. We don't advertise. Tomorrow? Is another day. Morning. The deposit is refunded to you if the cake is returned undamaged after the wedding. If you cook your wedding cake, then before the reception you place it inside like this. Then when the bride's going to cut the cake, you simply get out the real one. Won't everybody laugh? No, of course not. No one has a real wedding cake nowadays. All right, then. I'd like to collect it on Friday afternoon. Righto, love. I'll put it on one side for you. Thanks ever so, Joyce. He's such a good boy. Insisted on making the tea. Well, it's the least I could do, mom, after a meal like that. Real home-cooking. You must miss Boston, Ricky. Not as much as I used to. Oh, sir, I got these for you at the force's PX. Thanks, Ricky. I wish I didn't need them. Every time I run for the shelter, I wheeze like a Billy goat. Well, you won't have to run to one much longer, love. Mr. Churchill says the tide has turned. Churchill. He makes it all sound like an outing to south England. We're hoping it's gonna be over by Christmas. There'll be some changes when it is. No more rationing, no more queues. No more Churchill. Now, if we had a leader like Roosevelt or Stalin, men of vision. Oh, you. How long's your leave, Ricky? Oh, can't say, mom. We're still being debriefed on that last little bit of excitement. That was lucky how you got out of Arnhem so quick, son. Yeah, I guess it was. Lot of guys didn't make it back. I bet you had a big booze up when you got back. No, I didn't have a big booze up when I got back. I did what I always do. What's that? I went to mass. Is it true being catholic you can't marry outside of your church? No, as long as the girl takes religious instruction and the children are brought up in the faith. I just wondered. In here, Walter. Hello, baby. Just like the first time I came here, isn't it? We were talking about automobile insurance, and you were thinking about murder. I was thinking about that anklet. And what are you thinking about now? I'm all through thinking, baby. I just came to say good-bye. Good-bye? where are you going? You're the one that's going, baby, not me. I'm getting off the trolley car right at this corner. Why don't you stop being fancy. Let's have it, whatever it is. All right, I'll tell you. A friend of mine's got a funny theory. He says when two people commit a murder, it's like they're riding on a trolley car together. One can't get off without the other. They're stuck with each other. They have to go on riding together clear to the end of the line. The last stop's the cemetery. Maybe he's got something there. You bet he has. Good-bye, baby. How you doing, good-looking? Ricky, I was wondering if you had any second thoughts about seeing me anymore. Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah. Why are you all dolled up? 'Cause I'm a natural optimist. What did you do today? Did a little for al, did a little for uncle Sam. Tell me about it. Oh, I can't do that. Secret maneuvers, you know. You can tell me. I'll keep a secret. I bet you can. Just like any woman can. Only problem is... You'd have to tell just one more woman. Last night... You enjoyed it? More than anything I've ever done before. I never thought I'd meet a man who controlled his own destiny. That's nice. This girl said to Edward G. Robinson in a movie... "I always wondered what it would be like to be a gangster's moll." Is it everything you've expected? Better. Ricky... Gum-- gun molls get to be given little presents, don't they? Well, I was only thinking about a pair of nylons. I'll see what I can do. The whole world's out there, baby, just waiting to be taken. We're going to knock over a roadhouse. Great. Great. Where? Uh, I remember one that's just a couple of miles up the road over here somewhere. Okay. Georgie, not now, okay? Okay. I'm just going to go over and look around and see what's up, okay? You stay put. Okay. I'll keep a lookout. Tomorrow god's getting up early, and I'm going to tell you why. He doesn't want to mess with the marines keeping their appointment with destiny. I don't have to tell you that some of you won't return, and god's taking care of that as well. The U.S. Marine has a special place in heaven. The U.S. Marine has a $10 seat in that great barracks in the sky. At ease, lieutenant. At ease. Are you ready for the big push tomorrow, lieutenant? Sir, yes, sir. That's the spirit, 'cause if we're going to go down, we're going to go down... Fighting! Lieutenant, have my car brought 'round. Yes, sir. What is it? What's going on? What's happening? It was a setup. There were cops all over the place. They were there for US. But how did they-- how? Yeah. Someone talked, that's how. Well, it wasn't me, Ricky. I mean, I didn't even know we were coming here, did I? I know that, baby. Trust me, if it was you, my boys would have told me. What, you mean you have me watched? Let's just say they know where you live, they know what you do. They know everything. Well, what just happened back there? It was a setup. There was an FBI guy there waiting for me. Goddamn it! FBI. Bullshit! Snafu. Bullshit! Snafu--situation normal, another fuck-up. Too bloody right! American gangster? Friend of al Capone's? You're just full of crap. And I thought that you were big-time, thought I'd really found what I'd been looking for. Fur coat snatch? No fur coat. Pub robbing? Not even a bottle of beer. You're just a big mouth yank, honey pie. Oh, yeah? Yeah. We'll see about that. Where to, governor? This isn't a fare, you idiot. It's a stickup. Give me your money. Money? You must be joking. I haven't even had a fare all evening. I guess this is just your unlucky night. Hey, wait a minute. What's going on here? You bastard! Hey, I'm on your damn car! I'll get you to an M.P.! Aah! Ricky, stop. Huh? Stop. I want you to stop the truck now. Aah! You do anything for an encore? Ha ha ha! You know the only difference between you and the Kraut? I broke his neck... Like that. What--what are these stains? They're blood stains. When you kill a Kraut, you cut off his ring finger. All paratroopers do it. It's a custom. Everything all right, dear? Oh, yes. Thanks, Mrs. Evans. My friend's just leaving. All right. Well, if you need me for anything, I shall be under my bed. All right. Good night. Good night. She's worried about the flying bombs. Good night, Mrs. Evans! Good night. Oh, they just sell publicity pictures. You know, it gives the boys a bit of a thrill. Can't wait to tell the guys at the base I'm going out with a real movie star. Well, I'm hardly in the Cagney and Raft league. Oh, I met them last time I was in Hollywood. Did you? Yeah. The entire time I spent with them, they didn't kill a single person. I don't believe you. Thanks. Do you know when that bomb went off, we nearly died? I was really scared. I was, too, Georgie. Really? God. Well, I didn't think anything could frighten you. I'm not Superman, Georgie. I mean, you cut me, I'll bleed. I mean, when we were sitting there in the park waiting for that bomb to drop on US... Well, it's true about what they say, you know. Bits of your life do flash before you. I remember... I remember thinking about the days and nights and... Years I used to wait for my father to come visit. He never did. My mother--he left her when I was a kid. But, uh, she worked as a maid. We didn't really have a lot of money. You don't want to hear any of this. No. Yeah, yeah, I do. Go on. Well, you can guess the rest. Even in the land of the free, your chances are few without a college education. So I got my education where I could-- in the bars, clip joints, brothels, gambling houses of Chicago. I was a bright and eager kid, too. The mob likes bright and eager kids. And you can see the rest. You've got a girl in every city in Europe? No. Just London. Will you, uh, be staying here after the war's over? Oh, it's up to the boss, you know, but that's the plan. Well, what about you? Well, that depends on my career, really. Here or New York. I'd really like to see you perform. You haven't had any free time with me yet-- probably because it's rationed. Are you performing anywhere now? Not at the moment. I--I've had this rash on my stomach. Well--it-- I'm going to the doctor's tomorrow. Don't worry. It's only a rash. It'll be better in no time, I promise. You sure? Yeah. I wouldn't lie to you, Ricky. I'm not that kind of girl. Then I guess I better cool down, huh? Ha ha ha! And another winner for Chicago Joe. Come on! Going to break the bank at this rate, Chicago. It's nothing, Lenny. Just the sign of a misspent youth. Lenny, I need a pair of nylons. Oh, yeah? What size? I mean, are they for Georgina or Joyce? Georgie. So, uh, haven't scored yet, huh? Lenny, I always score. All right, you connected there, Chicago. Not for me. She's a commando. Yeah, but she'll give you a good time, though. That's not all she'll give you. Now, I'll have the result in a day or two. Meanwhile, I suggest-- how shall I say-- you rest a little. Now, you needing anything for the weekend? I was thinking of a nice bar of soap. Soap. Right. Anything else? No. Chicago, nice girls are all very well, but in your world you could be dead tomorrow, so fuck while you can, and better be safe than sorry. These will give you every protection, and I'm not talking about buns in the oven. Warren, my mother always said... "Keep a clean body "and a pure mind... And you'll go far." No, Ricky. No, Ricky! Uh, I've got to go, Joyce. You're annoyed? No. Honey, I'm not. I've--I've... I've really got to go. What about the pictures? You promised. Honey, orders are orders. I think your commanding officer is horrible. I'm not crazy about it myself, you know. But why have you got to go back to camp, Ricky? I told you, honey. Secret maneuvers, you know. Okay? You have the note? Yeah. 5 Bob on the nose, all right? Done. I'll see you around, Johnny. Ahh. All right, then. What you two got planned for tonight, eh? He won't tell. It's a secret, Lenny. Yeah? I bet it's something special, Georgina. It's bound to be, even if it's dangerous. Dangerous? Our Ricky? Don't be silly, Georgie. He's trained not to take risks, are you, Rick? Even someone like me, Lenny, has to take risks sometime, right? Right. Ahem. I, uh...I got a surprise for you. Ricky. How wonderful. They're only a pair of nylons. Yes, but if only you knew how long it's been since I've had a new pair. Wait till you see what I got planned for US tonight. You're going to love it. Fur coat? Hey, you be patient. I'm going to meet your boy. Ricky, you are a tease. I'm a tease. You look wonderful. What you brought me here for? To take care of a little unfinished business. Don't have to worry about that rash anymore, Georgie. I got US a little protection. Oh. Hey, what's the matter? I see. You don't think I'm good enough to be your gun moll. Of course I do, Georgie. Do you? Yeah. Well, then-- then prove it. Okay. Okay, I will. Good. Hey, Georgie... I think I remember promising you a fur coat. Thank you, Ricky. It's my pleasure, ma'am. What's up? You miss your train? Yeah. Any chance of a lift? Where you going? Bristol. Oh, you're in luck. We're going as far as reading. Be able to get a connection there. What's your name? Violet. Hi. My name's Georgie. Hey. Ricky. Put your bag in back. Come on, Georgie, give her a hand. Oh, it's ever so kind of you. I hope it's not too much trouble. Oh, I promise you, it's no trouble at all. Come on. I'll give you a hand. So what's a pretty girl like you running around London this time of night? What were you gonna do, lug that case all the way to Bristol? No. I was gonna try to find somewhere to stay for the night. I had an address, but in this blackout, all streets look the same. Do you live in Bristol? Yeah. I came up to London to see me fiance. Oh, great. Did you have a good time? No. I walked in and caught him having a good time, though, with his wife. Oh, that's too bad. He's a yank like you. He said he was gonna marry me and take me back to the states with him. I saved up all me clothing coupons and bought all new clothes to get married in. That's awful. That's really horrible. You can't trust anybody these days, can you? It makes me sick. There, mum. We'll look after you, won't we, Ricky? Do you want a cigarette or something? Oh, ta. You're really kind, both of you. It's the least we could do, considering one of my countrymen let you down. I should have listened to me mother. She was right. I guess we should all listen to our mothers. That's a Glenn Miller tune, isn't it? Yes. It's a pity you haven't got a wireless in the lorry. Did I say something funny? No. It's a private joke. What's the matter? I think it's a flat. Oh, no. We're miles from anywhere, aren't we? It's an inner wheel. It's that bad? Means I got to take both of them off. I know. Why don't you go and look around and see if there's anyone who could give US a hand? Yeah, sure. Here, take this. Now's our chance. No. Not here. Why not? I thought that's why you set it up. Georgie, someone might come. Ricky! Okay. I'll try. Together, Ricky. Together. Having any luck, Violet? No. Not a sign of anyone. Oh, no. Is there anything I can do to help? Yeah why don't you shine the light on that wheel. Ooh. I think I'm getting cramped. I don't think we're going to get that wheel off. You can manage it, Ricky. You can manage it. It's not as easy as it looks, Georgie. I--i think we should go look for a gas station. Come on. Why not here? I told you, I'll help. And so will I. You think you can handle it? If you give me the chance. Okay, we'll try again. Oh, great. The engine noise should drown out any of the screams. That's more like the Ricky I know. Oh, there you are. Yeah. I--i got the wrench. Violet, do you want a cigarette? Ooh, yeah, I'd love one. Cold, isn't it? Brrr! All right. Um...ahem... I'm going to need some blocks out of the back of the truck. This wheel's not coming off. I'll do it. I'll give you a hand. Oh, thanks. Oh, my god. What was that? Aah! No! No! Aah! No! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Help me! Help me! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Stop it! Aah! Grab her hands! Help me! Ha ha ha! Aah! Aah! Here, use these. Aah! Aah! No! Help me! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Ha ha ha ha ha! Help! Help! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Wonderful, Ricky. That was wonderful. Mine. Mine. How does it look? How's it look? It looks great. They're nasty stains, but I think soaking them in salt will shift them. Thanks, mom. Here you are, a nice fresh one. Thanks. Are you sure you weren't hurt? Yeah. I told you, it was my buddy. There was blood every--everywhere. I couldn't go back to base looking like this. I couldn't face it. I'm sorry about showing up this way. Your C.O. and his secret maneuvers. He should be more careful. I've made up a bed for you in the spare room so you can get a few hours rest. Okay. Thank you. Thanks. You must get some rest, Ricky. You look absolutely exhausted. Come on. Come on. Ricky, the war won't miss you for a night. You can sleep here. No, I can't, Joyce. You see, um, I'm involved in a situation that I have to resolve now. If I don't... It might come back to hurt me in the future. You're going to have to trust me, Joyce. I promise, after tomorrow, there will be no more problems. Just please don't ask me anymore. Ricky Allen, you've got more secrets than a cat's got whiskers. I know about one of your secrets. What? Something fell out of your clothes when you were taking your shirt off. I found this. Joyce, they're general issue. I have to carry them with me. It's orders. You didn't think I was... No, of course not. I checked. They're unopened. No, no, no, no. I'll look after these. I'll put them in my bottom drawer. I have to get some sleep. You won't forget to wake me. Shh. What are we going to do after this, Ricky? I want to get something to eat. Is that all? First things first. And then? Georgie, the truck's out of commission, okay? Ricky. We don't need the truck. Don't you ever want to get some rest? We can rest in the grave. Oh, yeah? Hmm. You think they serve coffee and doughnuts there? Look, if you don't want to come, I'll go on my own. I could do it, you know, on my own. Georgie, come on. Aah! We'd better get out of here. I know how much you hate violence. There's a cafe at Knightsbridge open all night. Knightsbridge? I'm not walking all the way to Knightsbridge. It won't take long. We can always take a taxi. Georgie! Ha ha ha ha! What? I told you, not until I get something to eat. Ricky, we can get something to eat later. I'm hungry, Georgie. No, Georgie! Yes, Ricky! Stop. Stop! Georgie, come in here now! Stop! You bastard. Georgie, it just wasn't meant to be, okay? Come on. You want a taxi? Yeah. I'm private hire. Where do you want to go? I'll just get my boyfriend. Ricky! Yes! Make it snappy. I'm breaking the law tarrying for customers. Where do you want to go? 311 king street. That'll cost you 10 Bob this time of night. That's fine. We're here. I want to go further. Much further. How far? I'll let you know when we get there. It's going to cost you more. That's fine. Take the old stains road. Please. This will be fine. Move over or I'll give you more of the same. What are you going to do? I don't know. Georgie, look out the back. See if anybody's following US. No. No one. Good. Check him. He might have a rod on him. Ugh! No, nothing. Aah! Shut up! Wet. Look. Pens. Ooh, lovely lighter. Bet that's worth a few Bob. Ohh. His name is George Heath. Got a wife and kids. Nice-looking boys. Grab his feet. All right. I got blood on my hands. Can I sit in the front on the way back? Yeah. Come on. Let's go. Now can I get something to eat? Uh-huh. Not now, Georgie. I'm tired. Come on. Aah! Aah! Get up! What are you doing in my car? I'm sorry. I needed somewhere to sleep. Where are you from? Up north. You're a deserter, aren't you? Yes, sir. Private John Wilkins, fourth battalion, royal Yorkshire, sir. Please don't tell. I haven't damaged your car. Got any money? Not a penny. Take that. Better be more careful about whose car you sleep in. Get out of here before I change my mind. 8 shillings. Oh, come on. It's real silver, Lenny. 10 Bob. A pound. Leave off. The only reason I'm offering you 10 shillings is because you're a friend, Chicago. Okay. You got a deal. Lieutenant Ricky Allen. What a surprise! I thought you were back at base. I didn't expect to see you till this evening. Yeah, some unfinished business kept me in town. Len, don't you feel Ricky looks a little bit pale? He needs a nice bit of fresh air. Come on. We're going greyhound racing. Oh, lovely coat. Thank you. Do you like it? You must have been a very good girl to get all that, Georgina. No, Lenny. Very bad. Hey, some flowers. Oh, they're lovely. Do you want some? Yes, please. Oh, they smell lovely. This is beautiful. Look at how pretty it is. Oh, my favorite! Oh, my god. Hey Lenny, you can do me a huge favor. I didn't realize how late it was. Take Georgie to the track for me. Oh! Come on, Georgie. No, no, really. I got to go meet the boys. All right. So I'll see you later. Okay. Oh, guess what. Guess what. I got the results back from the doctor's. What results? You know, about my stomach. The rash. Negative. It's gone. I'm ready, willing, and able. Oh. That's great. Okay, um, I'll see you later. Is that a promise? Yeah, it's a promise. All right. Thanks for the great time. Bye. Come on, Lenny. Oh, ta. Ooh. If you need that money, that you won at the dogs, you'll find it in the gas cooker. I mean, it's safe in there, love, in case of the buzz bombs. You know, he's terribly generous, Georgina. You're a very lucky girl. Luck? Yes, I suppose it could be luck. Mind you, I always felt that in this life there's only so much luck. Luck gets rationed like everything else. That's how it's been for me anyway. You know, I'm so happy when I'm with him. Have you made any plans? Oh, no. Not yet. It's too early for that. But we both know that this is it for life. You know, he's more important to me than any other man I've met before. He's so many things that other men aren't-- honest, straightforward, and totally reliable. And late. He doesn't get here soon, you're going to miss the picture. Ricky. I don't want to scare you away or anything, but I've got something I have to tell you. What? I love you, Ricky. It doesn't make any difference if you don't feel the same because I've wanted to tell you for so long. I love you, Ricky. I think I've fallen in love with you, too, Joyce. Really? Honestly. Oh, oh, Ricky. Oh, god! I'm so happy. I've never been happier in my life, Ricky. All 17 years of it? 17 is old enough to die for your country, so it's old enough to fall in love. Of course it is. What about your parents? What do you think they'll say about you falling for a yank and all? Don't you think they know how I feel? They're both very fond of you. Dad talks about you all the time to his friends, and mom treats you like a film star. This film star's got to get back to base. Okay? Will I see you tomorrow? Yeah. About 6:00. When you get off work. Can I tell mom and dad about this? I thought they already knew about it. Lieutenant Ricky Allen, you are just a tease. Till tomorrow, darling. It is your privilege to remain silent. Any statement you do choose to make may be be used either for or against you in the event if this investigation results in any trial. Do you thoroughly understand your rights? Yes, sir. The car you were in when you were arrested, where'd you get it? I stole it from a car park near Hammersmith Broadway. What were your movements on Friday, October the 6th? Friday, I went dancing with a girlfriend. Ricky, is that you? What are you doing? Get out. Get out! And you've known this American for exactly one week. Since last Tuesday? And he spent every night in your room? Yeah. Yeah. That's right. What about Hulten, did he tell you to say those things? Who's Hulten? Ricky Allen. His real name is Karl Gustav Hulten. He's a private in the U.S. Army, and he's a deserter. A private! Look, I don't even know a stripper named Betty Jones. Yes, you do, Hulten. Georgina Grayson, showgirl... And a little stripper by the name of Betty Jones-- one and the same girl. Age? 18. Single? No. I was married when I was 16. I don't live with my husband. I haven't since the night that we were married. Okay, Betty, you were born in Wales and your parents presently live in nice. Yeah. That's right. And at the age of 13, you alleged that you had been raped by a young man. He wasn't a young man. He was my father's best friend! He came and picked me up from school and then he dragged me down an alleyway and he started to rape me, and he kept on raping me, and he didn't stop raping me for hours and hours and hours. But the charges against him were dismissed. No, they weren't dismissed! My father forced me to withdraw them. Why? Because he didn't believe me! Nobody did! After that, I was branded a liar and a whore. So you ran away from home three times... And subsequently ended up in a borstal institution. Wouldn't you run away from that? I'm afraid I got some very bad news for you concerning your husband. Stan. What's happened to Stan? He's missing, believed killed, at Arnhem. You, uh... You certainly appear to like the ladies, Hulten. You have a wife and child in Boston. Yes, sir. Prior to your desertion, you appear to have had a blameless record. Yes, sir. Tell me what you know about a man named George Heath. George Heath. Not much. I read something about him in the paper. Saturday afternoon. He'd been shot or something. It's silly, really. I only spent one night with him, but even that was awful. He gave me a bloody good hiding. Still, it comes as a shock to know that he's dead. Did private Hulten tell you that he was married as well? He's got a wife in Boston. In fact, he's got a wife and child in Boston. Did he tell you about a young lady called Joyce cook? She lives not far from you. In Hammersmith. Nice young girl. Apparently Hulten was planning to marry her. I was in the car when Heath was shot. I must caution you that you need not say anything unless you wish, but anything you do say will be taken down in writing and may be given in evidence. I didn't do it. Ricky did it. And he did a lot of other things as well. That's a Glenn Miller tune, isn't it? On your feet, soldier. It is your privilege to remain silent. You need make no statement whatsoever. Any statement you do choose to make may be used for or against you in the event that this investigation results in any trial. Do you thoroughly understand your rights? Yes, sir. Hulten... Your girlfriend is singing her head off. The only advice I can give you, sing louder. I told him I wanted to do something dangerous, but what I meant was like flying a bomber over Germany or something. First, she said, um, she wanted to do something exciting, like be a gangster's moll. I thought she was kidding, but she wasn't, she was serious. So I told her the truck was stolen. He never told me any time that his truck was stolen. All he did do was put a gun to my head and threatened me. I don't know. It seemed like, uh... The more crimes we committed, the more excited she got. I would have gone to the police, but he kept saying he was having me watched. I was also petrified, because he kept threatening me, saying his gang would kill me if I opened my mouth. And also he works for a mob in Chicago. I've never even been to Chicago, not once in my life, and that I can prove. Um... Then she said, uh... If I didn't help her hold up another taxi that she'd do it by herself. She'd take my gun. He said, "come on, let's go and get a taxi." But what he really meant was he wanted me to go with him to Rob a taxi driver. I had to pick him up from the chest. She helped me pick up his feet. We put him in a ditch about 3-5 feet from the car. When we got back to my flat, I said to him, "he's dead, isn't he?" And he said, "yes." And I said, "that's cold-blooded murder." And he said, "people in my profession haven't got time to think about what they do." You know, I'm, uh... I'm really glad that girl didn't die. Because she was a nice girl. I liked her. Move out! Do you plan on attending your husband's funeral? They recovered his body this morning. Hulten. Hulten. President Roosevelt has agreed to allow you to be tried by the British. Hey, is it true that you tortured your victims? Hey, Jones, what magazines have currently offered you £1,000 for a nude photograph? 2,000 if you've got one with a snake. What's your response to that? Do you have any messages for Joyce cook? Is it right you made her pregnant? I just wanted somebody to fill a little empty time with! I just wanted someone to fill some empty time with. Take my mind off my troubles. When you're on the run, you take comfort where you can find it. I'll take what's coming to me. But god as my witness, if it was not for that woman there, I would not be standing here today. George Heath's murder. 4. Take 2. Karl hulten and Betty Jones were subsequently charged with the murder of George Heath. They were tried at the old Bailey during January of 1945. Betty Jones was found guilty and sentenced to death. She was reprieved less than 48 hours before her execution was due to take place. She was released from prison in 1954. Karl hulten, the only American serviceman to be tried by the British during world war ii, was found guilty and sentenced to death. He was hanged on the 8th of march, 1945.
