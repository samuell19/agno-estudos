Burning Secret Good. Goodbye, madame. October ! Well, yes. . .the weather. Not very beautiful... - But consistent. - Ah, here's the mail. - Hello ! Edgar ! Who's there? Hurry ! Hello, Mama. Can I go down now ? Come on ! Hurry up ! Look at everything we have for the party tomorrow. Let's see. - Good. - We only need cigarettes. Fritz ! Go wake up 52. Fr?ulein de la Roche. Yes. You do it ! I can't be bothered to wake 52 up. 8 o'clock, Fr?ulein de la Roche. Get up ! - Good morning, Mister Hunter. - Good morning. Tell me, what was Mister Hunter doing in Fr?ulein de la Roche's room ? Perhaps she was ill. But he's not a docor. - Is there mail ? - No. Come. What a boor ! Why don't you greet them ? Greet them? But why? They're not real guests. They won a contest in a newspaper. They're staying here for free. Keep one thing in mind. You must respect the guests, even if they are annoying. - Understood ? - Yes. Good morning ! Is today the big day ? No, tomorrow. He'll be 13 tomorrow. I'm 14, I can go to the cinema. 13 ? You're already a man ! Give me the magazine. Who was foolish enough to throw away the magazine ? Edgar ! - Good morning, madame. - Good morning. Come here. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Good morning, Mama. Good morning, my boy. I already told you not to speak to Mlle de la Roche. But she's so nice. Exactly. Good morning. - Good morning, madame. - Do I have mail ? A letter, Eva. From papa ? Yes. Come. An arrival ! What a surprise ! Hello, manager. So, what's new? In autumn, this time of year ? Well, well. Ah, Herr von Haller ! Of course. Detective M?ller ! How many thieves were arrested this year ? Times are hard. The professional thugs are on strike . Competition from the pros. We'll take up your bags. Not the big one. I'm only staying the night. Room 53, I know it. Perfect ! Good day. What a car ! A tachometer up to 200 km/h. Fantastic ! A revolution counter, compressor, a gasoline gauge, fabulous brakes ! While breaking, you cross the window, right ? Come in ! What would Monsieur like ? What would monsieur like ? Nothing. Perhaps later. One moment. Tell the bellhop to come and get my dinner jacket. Yes. One moment. Are there pleasant guests ? Full of elderly people. Late autumn. Good. Yes. So, every time I press here, it's you who'll come ? Yes. All right. Detective, you're a bit of a graphologist. What do you make of this handwriting ? ''Be good enough to wait for the settlement of my bills.? The embellishments on the capital "R" suggest that he has money troubles. ''Since, at that time...? His manner of dotting his i's suggest that he is financially embarrassed at this time. You're splitting hairs. The letter is from baron Tosse. He hasn't paid anything in two weeks, go and speak to him. I can't do that. Herr M?ller ! House detective ! The season has been over for five weeks. The elevator man can do your job. I am pleased to note that you like our cuisine. But you're going to tell the baron that if he hasn't paid by noon tomorrow, I'm going to toss his bags out the door. Mama ! You could get me a Mercedes like that. It's a real high-powered car ! A great guy, too, that Haller. He's won the 100-mile race twice. You haven't seen his picture in the magazines ? Ah, lunchtime ! - Hello, Herr von Haller. - Hello. See, he knows us. Great, ice cream ! He's better than in his photos, isn't he ? Not so loud, Edgar. - I don't like it, actually. - None of that at the table ! But I didn't do anything ! A bottle of Mumm's. Pardon me, baron Tosse... I'm sorry, we no longer have it. Bring Heidsieck. We don't have that brand. God ! Come, good dog, with your mistress. Come, sit. By the way, you're going to write to Clara tomorrow to thank her. Your birthday gift has arrived. I already know what it is. Two pairs of socks, a cake. You're completely mistaken, my boy. Three pairs, and no cake. Good ! You know, on the other side of the lake, is the Italian border. Every night, smuggling is rampant. Pardon me ? I'll start again. You know, on the other side of the lake is the Italian border. Finished ! You could get some fresh air. It's very beautiful outdoors. I'm going to lie down for a while. My key, please. - Here you are, Frau. - Thank you. - My key. - Yes, Herr von Haller. Here you are. Good day. So, my boy, do you like the car ? Very much ! Does it corner well? But tell me, you know cars very well ! A little. Perfect! Do you want to take a ride ? That would be great ! But would my mother allow it ? Your mother ? I'll take care of that. I'll speak to her. So, what do you say? Yes? - Come on ! - Yes ! Come ! And the compressor? We start with it ! Do you want to become an engineer ? What does your mother think of it ? She will accept it. - Do you fly airplanes, too ? - Yes, of course. Have you already flown in a plane ? From Zurich to Geneva. Good. But... not by yourself ? No, with my father. Ah, well... Tell me, is Papa as nice as Mama ? You shouldn't mess around with him. For my birthday, I'm going to have a model airplane. And when is that ? - Tomorrow ! - What ? Gee ! We have to celebrate that together ! Do you know what ? if it's nice tomorrow, all three of us can go for a drive. Great ! My mother will be delighted. Do you think so? Yes? What did you want to say ? And he said that if it was nice tomorrow, the three of us could go for a drive in his car. Great, no? - He said that ? - Yes. My, that's very charming of him. There, look ! Edgar ! - Good evening. - My boy ! - Where were you ? - I was getting changed. Come on ! But Edgar, this is impossible. - Here is Herr... - Pardon me, Frau. My young friend is a bit eager. Permit me -- Haller. It was very kind of you to have invited my son. Edgar, your meal's getting cold. Thank you very much. You weren't kind to him, Mother. Here's the suitcase . - He's not leaving ? - It appears so. In any case, he asked to have the large bag brought upstairs. Even race car drivers need their rest. What's that ? A sportsman ? If this keeps up, they'll all leave tomorrow. Except for baron Tosse. He's staying. I'll hand him over to the police, if he doesn't pay. Do as you wish. There will be plenty of mushrooms tomorrow. It's always the case. "A boy shouldn't think too long." "A boy shouldn't yield to timidity." "A boy should prove his recklessness." "A boy should be a mischievous kid." "Even if you get hit, and expelled from school" "Even if you're never first, except when you're playing" "A boy should not think too long" "Even if everyone is howling." "Hands in his pockets," "And in his head," "Childishness and nothing else" "But if you are taken by surprise" "Disheveled, fighting" "It's the others who began it" "A boy shouldn't think too long" "A boy shouldn't feel fear or cowardice" "A boy should prove his recklessness" "A boy should be a mischievous kid" "Even if you're never first, except when you're playing" "A boy shouldn't think too long" "Even if everyone is howling." "A boy should absolutely be" "A mischievous kid." Excuse me. May I come in? Mama ! Mama ! Hello ! Stay here a while. Don't always leave me alone. You are my young man. That Haller is priceless. He amuses all the guests. Too bad he's leaving tomorrow. I would put him up for free. I know him. He doesn't play the piano for nothing. Meinburg... De la Roche... She has no need of that. I'm going to inspect. One moment. Since you're pleading with me, gentlemen and ladies, I am going to prove to you that I can really read thoughts. Freind Edgar... be kind enough to switch off the light. Thank you. So... You ! One moment... You have a very strange profession. You live off the turpitude of others. And you live very well ! In appearance harmless and friendly, you distrust everyone. In your eyes every man is a criminal unless you're convinced otherwise. You're always ready to attack and defend yourself, using... this ! It's loaded ! - Am I right ? - Yes. Give it back to me. Ladies, gentlemen ! Fantastic! What do you say to that ? What do I say to that ? It's time to go to bed ! - But you'll tell me everything! - Yes. - Really ? - Yes. To bed. - Good night. - Sleep well. Superb ! Good night. Good night, my boy ! - Don't forget our outing tomorrow. - No. Good night ! And now, an experiment with a lady. May I ask you, madame ? Me ? Why me ? You have a special power. A small attempt ? He really clowns around, that show-off! He's not a show-off, because he's my friend And not a clown Oh ? He reads thoughts and finds objects. He told M?ller, your house detective, that he had a revolver in his jacket. And it was true. Good night. Just a minute. I want to tell you that you're really a stupid ass. He's known fat M?ller for ten years. And you let yourself be fooled like that ? You and your friend ! You can keep your books. I'm not coming to the party tomorrow and I don't want to see you anymore! You're jealous because he's my friend. Exactly, my friend. Whether you like it or not, he's my friend ! Friend ? You really upset me. Don't make us wait too long. Don't look and don't listen, promise ? Tell me, does this childishness really please you ? Apparently, you don't read thoughts, madame. That depends. On what? Aren't you ready yet? Ladies and gentlemen I'm going to let them back in. Come in. So, two needles are hidden. Find them. Begin. Ladies and gentlemen I ask you for the greatest silence so that I can concentrate. One moment. Ladies, gentlement here is number one. Thank you very much. Please excuse me, gentlemen and ladies, but the experiment has fatigued me too much. And it's already late. Herr Haller. It was a bluff. You never would've found the second one. It's I who hid it. Look ! Here it is ! Fantastic ! Tremendous ! Well, good night to everyone ! Don't be angry ! Good night. Good night. Edgar ! Tell me, why aren't you in bed ? You were supposed to tell me what happened. What do you think happened ? Nothing happened. But you promised me. I'll tell you tomorrow. Good night, Mama. Sleep well ! Good night, rascal ! Mama ! Now what ? Mama, Haller's a really nice guy, isn't he ? Herr Haller, I believe that everything is upstairs. Good, good When would you like to be awakened? Awakened ? It's out of the question. I'm here for pleasure. A competition on the greased pole ! So, it's not that simple, would you say ? It's easy ! Listen, with sand on your hands, you can do it easily. - Can I try ? - Of course ! Go on ! - I'm going to look for your mother. - Yes. Married for 15 years ! Incredible. Your husband must be formidable. He is indeed. But also reckless. How so ? Because he leaves a woman like you... alone during the week. But I'm not alone. My son is accompanying me, and he's an adult. An adult ? They left a moment ago. They went there. Thank you very much. The sun isn't very hot. Summer will be over soon. If you will allow me to say so, life will be as well. Well. You have several decades ahead of you. I'm a racing driver. I have to look after Edgar. Yes, of course. Edgar ? He must be at the party. Do you think so ? It's a bit of luck that I persuaded him to climb. At least we had several minutes to ourselves. - He's a nice boy, isn't he ? - Yes. But you need a lot of patience with boys of that age. Edgar ! Were you waiting here long ? We looked for you everywhere. Oh? Where did you look for me? I stayed here the whole time. But nothing serious happened did it ? Go on, in the car, let's go ! - Is there mail ? - Alas, no. Ah, Herr Tosse ? Yes ? May I ask you to follow me into the office ? That was very nice. Thank you so much. Madame has a telephone call. Your husband. Just a moment, please. Come here. Well ? What's going on ? What is it ? You're sulking. You didn't look for me. Just a minute, Edgar, I have a gift for you. Your birthday gift. Or do I ? It's upstairs. Yes, just a minute, I'll look for him. Edgar ! It's papa, for your birthday. Hello ? Thank you ! It's a professional swindle. I forbid you to make such accusations. It's up to you to ask for the money, not this stupid detective. In your place, I would weigh my words. I'm giving you twelve more hours. If you haven't paid up by tomorrow morning, I'm going to hand you over to the police without any pity. Goodbye, papa. No, he's fine. He's just moody. The weather ? Wonderful ! Like summer, very hot. The society ? I haven't worn an evening gown even once.. I'm staying for a bit. Goodbye,my dear. My dear. Tell me, what did your father do to you that you're so horrid to him ? My dear baron, your word of honor is as valuable as Morgan's signature. In America we think that Europe should pay its debts on its own. In America we don't interfere with the European economy, on principle. Pardon me. Would you like a cigar ? Tell me, Herr M?ller, do you know Herr von Haller well ? Of course. For years. He's practically a regular here. So, when he read your thoughts, he was bluffing ? Of course ! It's always a put-on ! Four stripes, overhand. No, like this instead. Come in ! Enchanting ! How did you get in ? Black suits you to perfection. What do you want ? Dear lady, would you kindly place this among Edgar's gifts ? Thank you very much. Edgar will be very happy Well? He rules over a divine disorder here. Ah, I feel quite weak. Really ! Really ? You feel quite weak ? But not here. -What a pity ! - Goodbye. - Dear... - Goodbye ! Dear lady... Can I appeal to you one last time? Did you have a visitor, mother? The bellboy came. From Herr von Haller, for your birthday. Well ? You're not even going to look at it ? It doesn't interest me. What do you have agianst M. von Haller ? Yesterday you were full of praise for him. Yes, but that was yesterday. Madame, where were you today ? We had a marvelous excursion. Do you know... Yes. We've played bridge together. Yes, we played together. In fact, the bridge party has started up again. We're only waiting for you. Thank you, not tonight. What a pity. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. But you play bridge every night. Tonight I don't wish to.. Have you already thanked Herr von Haller ? No. Thank you very much. So, did you like it, my boy ? I didn't have time to open it. Well, go to your room and open it. Of course. As long as I can stay upstairs. Sleep well. You can take the cake and the rest. I wanted to give you this for your birthday, Edgar! Look. What is it ? Wait a bit ! It's slightly damaged. It was difficult to detach, do you see ? But wait here's something that comes from Hollywood. Hollywood ? Hollywood ! But its very beautiful ! I notice something in what you said: you don't like Edgar. What an absurd idea, dear madame ! I like him for the simple reason that he is your son. But you are against him. I am against him. I pity you. Your conception of your duties is strange. He's still a child. He's not a child. He's 13 . I was 13 myself. At 13, a boy has his own life, of which his mother has no idea. - Listen carefully ! - Yes. Well ! What is he doing here ? I am allowed to invite my freind Edgar. Very well ! - To you health, young man. - No, thank you. Go on, drink. No, no. Not so much. Not like that ! Do you want a cigarette ? No, thank you ! Come on ! Who is it ? Herr von Haller, of course. Things are following their normal course.. He's already playing music. And he himself brought the record. You are a coward. And you are too bold! So beautiful, and such a fine character, too. Do you know the words ? "They smile at each other tenderly'' ''Only a single word is spoken, lovingly: you" And the beginning: "A man can be a shrewd connoisseur of women" "And wait with all his soul and heart" "For the one he'll love truly" "She alone" "Has he seen furtively, in a dream" "And chance suddenly sends her" "She comes near, she is there" "Nothing is said." "Nothing is asked" "They know at that very instant" "That they love each other" "Nothing is asked" "Nothing is said" "One look" "Is happiness" "Supreme" "He asks nothing" "She says nothing" "Because he feels what she feels instantly" "They smile at each other" "Tenderly" "Only a single word is spoken, lovingly:" "You" I'm so happy that I stayed ! And to what do I owe that ? To a mirror ! Yes, Imagine, you enter the dining room, bored, and suddenly, a glance in the mirror: You ! "I ask nothing," "a single glace" "And happiness comes." But that's the end of the song. How so ? Isn't there another side ? Come on, I have to go down. I don't know what it is. Everything is spinning. You're just tipsy. Come on, let's go. It was good, wasn't it? I disturbed them, down there. Good. Good night. Are you asleep ? Don't be afraid of speaking up, Herr von Haller. The little one is already asleep. Mama ? "Ah, ah, Edgar's there!" "A boy should neither understand nor see" "Everything that adults can understand and see." "A boy should be asleep at 9 o'clock" "You should therefore be asleep at 9 o'clock." "So, Mama is only there for me" "Because you're only a child, you see?" Mama ? What secrets are you hiding from me? Why don't I understand you ? Edgar ! Mama ! You're placing me in an impossible situation... Leave immediately ! I'm happy to be here. Leave at once, or I swear that I'll never speak to you again. What if someone saw you ? But no one saw me. Who's there ? Pardon me. Baron Tosse ! Madame, I must speak with you. Yes, but now, in the middle of the night ? Yes, but it's a matter of great importance and one that cannot wait. May I come in ? Yes ? Pardon me. What do you want ? Dear madame, I am desperate You are the only person who can help me here. I... have urgent need of a sum that is superflous to you. You're joking ! This is the worst insolence I've ever seen ! Could you write me a little check ? It's impossible. Leave now. At once. Then you don't want to help me ? I am going to have to speak to Herr von Haller. Please. Nothing is standing in your way. Herr von Haller ? May I see you for a moment ? Answer yes to my questions And not a word more, not a word. He must be... here. And here he is ! Well, Edgar ? Is the medicine working ? Yes. So I can leave ? Yes. Good, my child. Sleep well. Your anxiety wasn't justified, madame. He's doing fine. Well, I'll be able to sleep. Thank you very much, Herr von Haller. By the way, Baron Tosse wishes to speak to you. Tosse ? Here ? Baron ! Would you like to settle your small debts from yesterday's game? And this before midnight ? I would consider that the height of good manners ! Pay? That's a good one ! Quite the contrary. Wouldn't it be better to discuss this in my room ? - Madame. - Herr von Haller. Good night. Mama ? Was Herr von Haller here, just now ? He was sitting on my bed, no ? Or... was it only a dream ? Yes. Yes, it was a dream, my boy. And now, go to bed. Good night. - Good morning, baron. - Good morning. Please excuse yesterday's scene. This really disturbs me, but in autumn... It's fine. Thank you very much. Goodbye, Herr Baron. What an impostor ! He paid ! From whom did he steal the wallet? Not from me, certainly ! Yes, madame, complete our bridge party ! The baron has departed. What a shame ! Tell me, Herr von Haller, do you know where Tosse got this money? I ? How would I know that ? Am I a soothsayer ? Pardon me ! I had forgotten ! You are the most impudent man I've ever seen. In other words, you love me. But seriously, madame, forget this idiot Tosse. I gave him the money, he's already far away. I won't forget this matter. And...Edgar ? He won't think about it anymore. Thank God. The devil! What a dreadful taste! You should drink coffee at our home. Right, Mama ? Did you finally finish writing ? This one is for papa ! You won't forget to sign it ? But it's illegible ! Let's go back now. Thank you. I forgot my penholder. Edgar will get it. M. von Haller forgot his pen holder. Here it is. You see, Mama, good thing that you brought me. Pardon me. What joy that you've come alone ! Don't get any ideas. His being locked up has nothing to do with you. He was being impossible. Who's there ? I've come to get madame's coat . Does she want to leave ? We'd better to go back. No. We'll go soon. The car left. My coat. One moment. My mother is not going to leave with you. Go! Leave, I tell you ! What's going on ? Herr von Haller ? Herr von Haller ? What happened? A little altercation with your son. Edgar ? I would've had a hole in my skull had I not dodged him in time. But you're bleeding ! My lord, what did you do to him ? - Where is Edgar ? - I don't know. He ran away. Edgar ! Yes, thank you ! Central ! What an awful story... M?ller ? Try to calm her. Yes, I'm coming. Put me through to the police station. He's not here. We searched everywhere. Yes, thank you. Is this the police ? But what's going on ? Damn it, isn't anyone coming ? Why are you shouting like that ? Forgive me, I'm not the type to yell but I'm ringing and no one has come to help me. But can I help you ? Well, how did you get in here? Where did you get on ? Do you have a ticket ? And where do you want to go ? To Zurich, to my grandmother's. Oh ? To Zurich, to your grandmother's ? Tell me, are you hungry? He's a great kid, Edgar. And he's also my friend. Martha ! Yes. - Is breakfast ready ? - Immediately. - Can you draw my bath ? - Yes. - And my cigarettes ? - I'll bring them. - Do you have the hot-water bottle ? - Yes. Did you call the hotel for my daughter? Yes. She must be very worried. Learning that Edgar is here will reassure her. My husband's two escapades did not worry me. Drink that. All of it. - Have a good trip, and my regards to the little one. - Thank you so much. Goodbye. Please. Dear madame, I'm happy that nothing happened to Edgar. I blame only myself. Really. Everything is taken care of now. Here is my car. Well. Dear madame, I don't want... Bon voyage. So ? The matter is settled ? Yes. For you, perhaps. Stop lecturing me ! That affected her more than you think. - You really believe so ? - Certainly. She should have been told that love and adventure are two very different things. Yes, but alas, it's too late now. Well... Goodbye. M?ller ! Will you always take me for a rogue ? Professional secret ! Fr?ulein de la Roche's luggage on the 9 o'clock train. Wait ! Put the luggage in my car, here. Will you take me ? It would be so nice of you. Yes. Come quickly ! Hurry, please. What is it ? A breakdown ? No, a little comedy. And I would very much appreciate your assistance. A car is going to pass soon. - A woman will be seated in it. - And ? She must see us together. And then, she will know that love and adventure are two very different things. And I hope that will make her parting easier. I don't understand. It's not serious. Sorry. - Herr von Haller ? - Yes ? Is everything alright now ? Yes. I hope so. What a scamp ! He fled without any warning. What's more, you defend him. Of course ! You send him card games, the perfect little scamp. It's true. And look at the result. I'm going to go and speak to him. Stay here and let him sleep. Sit down and read the paper, it'll put you in a better mood. But I'm not in a bad mood. I'm just nervous. She should be here by now. My God, I have to go to the office. If you arrive a bit late, it won't be a tragedy. You're going to lose the trial, anyway. Very nice. It's madame ! Ah, finally ! I'm glad to see you. And I as well. My dearest ! Mama ! - Where's Edgar ? - In there. Just a minute, I have to speak to you. Slowly, take off your coat. A minute, please ! So tell me, what got into you, you rascal, to run away and frighten your mother like that ? Well ? Have you lost your tongue ? What happened ? Did someone do you harm ? For heaven's sake, you have to have had a reason to run away without warning ! I left because... I didn't have any reason to leave. What ? Out of sheer bravado and insolence ? Yes. If it was insolence, everything is reallly for the best. Your education ! God, I have to leave ! Well. Since you owned up to it, let's forget the past ! Come. You were frightened, too, weren't you ? Oh, yes ! The rascal doens't look healthy. Incredible! I haven't seen him for three weeks... His eyes... His eyes have changed completely. And his face has taken on new traits. - Do you think so ? - Yes. Well... The children are certainly growing up. Finally! I'm glad you're back. We have to celebrate. I'm going to spend half an hour at the office signing a few papers, and I'll come back immediately. Goodbye. Come, come. A man doesn't cry. You are already a man. Really, Mama ? Yes. My boy. Are you angry with me ? No. Thank you.
