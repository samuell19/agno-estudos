make it easy but you live longer that crazy kid all right mac you can go on anybody get in touch with you they're lucky there's something still in one piece open it see if we can get a line on it just about made out his license number 501-777 lucky number check with motor vehicles see who gets the prize chef remembers what do you make of this some kind of gimmick to make his car go faster maybe that's no part of a car that's for sure well whatever it is he won't be using it must have been important to hide under a hood are you getting one of your hunches again well looks like he was sneaking in doesn't it where to i don't know if i knew what it was and i could tell all right let's just tell you what on the way back we'll stop in to see that federal man assigned to this area i think his name is william knowing lester here and his hunches i figure i might as well humor him he did a hit with army ordinance well i'm not much of an engineer myself i think it's some kind of a gun mechanism not far from the lab at los alamos why don't we take it over to them good idea los alamos new mexico a united states experimental center for military applications of atomic energy no alcatraz of fort knox was ever guarded more closely there it stands in a mesa above the new mexico desert like some slumbering volcano its power and its secrets held deep within its walls its operations many and buried may not be described for security reasons but this much can be said here at los alamos has found the cream of scientific genius the physicists and engineers who design and develop nuclear components of atomic weapons who are responsible for detonating completed weapon assemblies and measuring results overnight the contents of the mysterious case will put through the works its practical characteristics examined and studied is against the theory of engineering principles no part was left untouched unrecorded they were out to find out what made it tick but they were taking no chances of not being able to fit the pieces back in place again this was one humpty dumpty they'd be able to put together again although williams never had any idea that the jigsaw puzzle brought to him by sheriff ramirez had any connection with atomic energy he came to the right place that innocent little bag of machinery was a brand new idea in atom bombs a portable affair so engineered it can be carried into the country in separate parts each part weighing less than 50 pounds sounds like a science fiction plot doesn't well this one is true quite true what about the force would it still pack the same punch size is no longer a factor mr williams we're dealing with the atom a speck and each speck loaded with infinite power a kind of power that can kick a million tons of water out of bikini lagoon or right out of the panama canal does that make any sense mr williams enough to know what it can do in the wrong hands the atomic energy commission using its most recently developed a bomb set off a blast the following morning at frenchman's flat nevada 100 miles from las vegas the reactions throughout the country were mixed ranging from jokes to serious comet in las vegas one of the players in the casino lost claiming the blast had rocked a roulette wheel doing him out of a winner in washington dc paul regan chief of the security investigation division had his own ideas about the incident this time we chose the spot tomorrow it could be right out that window for los alamos a boy may be the answer well there's an answer somewhere my own guess is that the case was smuggled over the mexican border went out on its way to the mexican border well for one thing he was headed in the opposite direction when he crashed maybe he lost his way not according to a check of gas stations leading from the border he stopped to gas up a few times that sheriff and his staff working on it yes sir funny job like that would be trusted to a kid why not who'd suspect a lamb well it's your lamb from now on johnny i'm transferring you from the new mexico field office and assigning you full time to this job so double check to make sure you know these are no ordinary thugs like you get on income tax evasion but fanatics who consider it a privilege to die resources tricks and genius on their side run down every move that kid made up to the crash i'll keep figuring from this end good luck thanks but all that led to was a lot of exercise according to the boy's friends he was okay in their book tough break for jonesy being measured for a cough instead of the gi uniform he was scheduled to put on next month they dug way back in jonesy's background talked to his minister his school teacher his former employers and girlfriends but nobody had a bad word to say against jonesy nobody but his mother that was only out of bitterness for the face which had snuffed out so young alive a life that cared about nothing except racing cars and motorcycles racing cars and motorcycles that kind of a hobby takes money where'd he get it odd jobs when he wasn't working steady that would just about pay for the gas i'm beginning to think he didn't know what he was delivering and i'm beginning to think you were right the first time nobody'd suspect a lamb i'm not going to give you the business that you were hand-picked for this job you weren't i take it for granted that every man here is already hand-picked and qualified you also know what we're up against and what it means our job is intercepting the rest of those bomb parts maybe they're all headed into new mexico maybe not but wherever their point of assembly is we've got to stop them gray alert all stations and field offices to notify us of any unusual operations yes sir as an extra precautionary measure we will assign a special detail to the new mexico area around los alamos they were lucky with the first installment on that bomb reagan told them next time it might not be so easy williams studied the setup against possible infiltration even the security investigation division when a side of the operation was subject to the strict regulations and security measures anything was possible when you were dealing with a bunch who could figure out a portable bomb and while special forces were being concentrated in and around new mexico waiting for more of the parts to show up two events occurred to focus attention elsewhere first a radar screen operated from a nearby training camp reported the presence of an unauthorized object deep in the louisiana bayous army sentries went on a search detail discovered that a helicopter had landed the pilot was picked up and held for questioning williams was summoned to new orleans identified the pilot's metal there's another portable section of the dread bomb what kind of fools do you take us for all right so i'm stupid a guy propositions for me to deliver a bag and a swamp 500 bucks no questions asked i take it i didn't know what was it what did he look like my heights maybe black hair mustache i was brown i don't know for sure what else he might have been a foreigner he had a french accent 90 of the cajuns around here speak french not this way i've lived around here all my life i'd know if he is this the man no sir you're telling the truth we'll find out about it soon enough if you're not you're a poor excuse for a citizen i needed the money is that 500 worth your life your honor call them for transfer to washington next it was new york's coney island to be spotlighted it was sunday the temperature 90 one of those humid days which new york is famous the evening papers would feature record crowds at coney and while the millions were having themselves a time just about a mile offshore a lifeguard making a routine inspection of marker boys was about to play a star role in the next chapter of the drama yes sir right away sir put this thing back where you found it what is it anyway bait for a fish i don't get it you don't have to take my word for it it's important and be sure you tie it up exactly the same way you found it right this time the bait worked williams who had flown to the new area of activity flashed orders to the coast guard cutter standing by to reel in their fish again as in the case of the helicopter pilot the fishermen claim to be the innocent duke he had been approached by a stranger at the fulton street market during a period last week when the fish weren't running well five hundred dollars he gives to me to pick up satchel what did he look like big like him is this a man oh no he had gray hair he had blue jeans all i got to do is deliver central to locker 12 o'clock what blocker pennsylvania station number uh what is this i don't understand what do you expect to find in that locker present i bought for the children some salt water taffy open it so nervous i can't get the key to fit give me at least i had the wrong locker all right mister well it's 7 after 12. it's a pretty small box for a locker this size that's our man get him smart downright smart nothing left to chance i tried to warn you they weren't amateurs hello emily hi well get that fisherman to do any talking oh he didn't know any more about it than the pilot did all i was interested in was making a fast buck how about you do you get that thing to do any talking first time i performed an autopsy on a satchel well it's galvanized iron common variety any check is to manufacture european make i believe i've been trying to find out its resistance to seawater now these strips have been soaking in a solution of seawater for different lengths of time now this one has been soaking for 12 hours and this one for 24. and uh this a little over 48. you'll notice that it matches the side of the case when it was pulled out in other words the case had been soaking for over 48 hours just about new york harbor being just back of coney island it could have been dropped off by any incoming ship you got a paper yeah incoming from where any european port here we are 48 hours of plants 48 hours 48 hours before we picked up the case the french liner felicitate docked but it didn't stop at coney island no it didn't but it could have passed a motor launch or even a rowboat could have picked up the case and anchored it to the boy maybe maybe it's a mistake to keep it out of the papers and not to let the public know what they're up against why shouldn't they know that the same little firecracker we develop might be dropped right into our own backyard anytime maybe even a better one smaller more powerful it wouldn't take too many of them to paralyze us hanford washington where plutonium for the a-bomb is produced the half-mile long k-25 planted oak ridge tennessee producers of uranium los alamos main arteries like los angeles pittsburgh washington and new york with its teaming millions and the harbor just a few prize packages can do it but don't take my word for it mr sands here is an expert on civil defense rather than just tell you i brought over some film to show you what'll happen if the atom bomb hits this country now you'll get an idea what we're up against if we fail to bring in every single part of that portable bomb and while we're talking here planning and wondering they may be ready now it'll be any american city some normal day around noon maybe people looking for work others working kids coming home from school rush hour when with no warning those caught within the epicenter the area extending for one mile from the point where the bomb hit are dead nothing is likely to survive winds build up to 800 miles an hour tear through like knives blowing out windows twisting steel is everywhere straw and even outside the epicenter buildings are left gutted destroyed warehouses factories brick homes pushed off their bases stripped of walls an entire city suddenly reduced to rubble thanks mr samson any questions not answered by that any idea where they might turn up next where they might be coming from who knows so far they've tried getting in by land sea and there one thing assured won't be any single concentration as we thought they could show up anywhere the password became on your toes everything and everyone became suspect from the pacific to the atlantic coast straight up into the sky deep into the heart of the country watchful eyes watched and probed and checked and hunted wherever there were satchels and pieces of luggage wherever there were parcels on the move and as the net was tightened and pulled in there were results one metal suitcase was found in the possession of a sailor shipped home from a mediterranean harbor an abandoned baby carriage accounted for another but not all the go-betweens had to be routed out one of them developed a case of conscience and delivered the satchel to a local precinct of his own accord another one became panic stricken and dumped it into an empty lot where some kids would later find it and bring it in hey there's lots of activity going on in there hey cooper daily ledger something big going on not a thing cooper just a routine security check where'd you get the bag from a woman at the bar come on come on you can think of a better one than that may i never live to see my wife honestly what's your business i'm in between right now yeah in between the devil and the deep blue sea two felony convictions parole sometimes comic sometimes tragic the search went on and like the other parts it found its way to the weapons laboratory at los alamos where the display was taking on frightening proportions six parts six guesses four of them exactly the same even the weight that means they have four prize packages planned at least the other two totally different sections but all part of the same pattern it makes three different parts altogether any idea how many would take to make up at least one of the bombs no way to tell yet they'd still need a critical mass the heart of the bomb mr williams the actual element that produces the nuclear chain reaction either plutonium or uranium-235 and that's it it would be good to know how close they are to the real thing well that's your department how's it going same spiel different words i got stopped by another newspaper man i don't know how much longer we'll be able to stall them as long as we have to we've enough to do without throwing the public into a panic it's getting tougher we've got them all the way from virginia to new mexico you can add a pennant to connecticut too what this time it's one of our own subs docked in at new london with uranium welded onto the hull below the water line uranium how soon does dr hallman figure they'll be ready for that too soon and here's another little item to mull over the stuff was removed in spite of the guards no one saw anything just the wound in the ship a geiger counter told them what had been there where was the sub in from marseille france was that the only port you touched the last time out no two others before france since we haven't been able to make any contact locally why not try it through the source what source the way i see it france why pinpoint france because that's where the belly of the octopus lives look at the tentacles and where they're reaching from marseille france the last port the sub touched before coming here with uranium on the hull previous to that dr lisbon what about the metal suitcase we picked out of that hot rod crash in new mexico we've since learned it happened 10 days after a french boat with a marseille registration dr tampico but nothing says the boy was in tampico what about the sailor we picked up with one of the parts he was shipped home from somewhere in southern france i hadn't even stationed in north africa before that just the same it adds up to a common denominator if there's any one place the belly of the octopus is cradled it could be right there so you figure a roping job my daughter partly all right let's hear your idea order the sub back to marseille one of our men on it yes sir might just be they'll try to use the sub again sounds reasonable we got familiar with navy oh loman sperry goldman he should have picked navy instead of air force well they also look the same yeah only one of them knows the difference between the bridge and the galley suppose i were assigned to some special duty like the preparation of a motion picture short on the operation of a sub what do you think you might get by that way wouldn't have to take an active part as a sailor all right williams get yourself another name and a couple of manuals on training films i'll see about a commission for you ensign pete is reporting for duty sir at ease mr peters nice to have you aboard thank you sir training film on the operation of a sub but we've got the equipment and the personnel yes we'll see that you get all the cooperation you need thank you sir marseille waterfront old port gateway to southern france crossroads for seamen of all nations a melting pot for some without a country to call their own so several of our men are already stationed about the submarine base good i want to get started right away andre he'll work with you you probably will need an interpreter i sure will we'll hit it off okay pal that sounds real american it is young is new york the name's really andy how was a trip across uneventful not much more to report from this end except assurances that the french will give us a free hand in this case and they'll do all they can to help meanwhile we got this list of name together for you all possibilities for one reason or another and all known enemies of the united states but nothing definite not enough to swap the waterfront hangout look at the re for a cell the cafe army to serve excellent refreshments there i'll let you know is oh your kind of music makes a guy homesick been overlong one day to be exact how long you gonna stay i don't know for sure buy a drink cup tell me about that clarinet player buzzolin he's up there with betty goodman and artie shaw yeah play's real great i wouldn't mind meeting him oh no sooner said than done come on buzz you got an admirer hi you play no i just listen good i don't like competition sit down join the party dave come over and have a drink with us excuse me got to keep the customers happy what's the name taylor oh peters horace peters horace i want you to meet margo wayne one of the prettiest reasons americans come to france how do you do i don't get any ideas leo here's her husband where are you from friend brooklyn or texas neither you see honey not all americans come from brooklyn and texas nothing but routine on ola musician played italian french riviera paris now cafe re in my city no background not his picture copy of his passport photo keep on all americans over here you mind if i borrow it what about dave norton the leader of the quartet the one allen worked for norton studied music here in the gi bill of rights stayed over complete dossier clean slate olin was very friendly with the waynes might as well check on them while we're at it first name leo hers is margo this is better leo wayne private signal core engineering degree mit married to a bordeaux girl margo quattro his father was a french collaborationist wayne is 29 no visible means of support suspected of subversive activity in the army dishonorable discharge any pictures on them there you are thanks captain i'll see that these are returned to you well this is important dave i'm trying to get a line on olin well uh he was a kind of a moody character i don't mean that when did he tell you he was leaving was just did he didn't i would have known about it except i owed him a couple days salary did he have any reason anyone sick at home or anything ah not buzz just got restless had a good solid job had lots of jobs never stuck to any of them did you take him to the plane yeah and me and the waynes they're his pals very close well she's the one who first gave me the knockdown of the guy as a matter of fact he left me in a spot not even a chance to replace him i tried to talk him out of it up to the minute the plane left early this morning did he have much luggage buzz only owns a suit in his back and a couple licorice sticks do you happen to know where he bought the metal case he carries his clarinet in i haven't any idea have the wayne's been around since he left not tonight but the only drop in about 11. one thing more dave i haven't been here gotcha thanks slippery boy we'll check all the luggage shops see if we can find out who made that clarinet case for mr olen while williams andre and the french police searched the noisy streets the narrow waterfront double checking every luggage maker in marseille back home the fuse was burning closer more parts more pins in the map more questioning and more midnight oil being burned this was the place they looked for this was the man who made the metal cases used to sneak out in parts into the united states looks like he run into something here he made up 48 of the specifications for a customer ask him where he delivered them no good truck ask him if the customer that ordered the cases is one of these just that he cooperates with the police all he could tell us was that someone had ordered 48 identical metal cases and he identified buzz olin as having ordered an additional four but he did identify leo wayne no he didn't but with allen's disappearance leo wayne is our only lead just because there were friends add that to the fact that leo and margo wayne were seen around the cafe continually and their friends were all a part of that special list you gave me also he's been seen hanging around the submarine area and it's more than just a coincidence that buzz olin ordered four identical metal cases when he only has one clarinet why don't you pick wayne up then because we don't have enough on him but i'm more than convinced that he's tied into this there were no metal suitcases in fact nothing of any importance when we searched the department then what was he doing hanging around the sub the subject curiosity hundreds of people come down to the dock every day if buzz old and ordered four identical metal cases then he or a friend must have had something to do with sneaking the uranium onto the hull of the ship well if it is it must have got someone to work with someone right on the submarine exactly how do we draw them out we just wait there's no time we've got to force them into the open how they probably think the submarine will remain here for a while we'll have it ordered back unexpectedly if they plan to use the sub again they'll have to do it right away that be fools maybe they think we are it's your show code this message attention security investigation division chief reagan that's just it tomorrow and then the day you're after goodbye of our country just beginning to have fun when we get called back see that's too bad well maybe i'll be back again maybe we'll all meet again in america i drink to that to the next time we meet on either side of the atlantic the courier flies out in the morning with duplicate microfilm it's set for next tuesday 3 pm you all right yeah somebody slugged this i tried to hang on to the guy but i couldn't margo we had her cold microfilm probably the whole setup on it she handed that microfilm to a semen this material is from an officer's uniform an officer yeah they're only six on the boat i'll meet you back at the shop hi chief oh mr peter last night before we shove off that's all the same to me why aren't you sure celebrating well i leave that to all the younger ones i got an arm full of tattoos and two kids back in new london connecticut who's off the boat they have saved lieutenant rand jesse mcgrew and some wesley i am a crew hi peters logged me out will you chief all right mr mcgrew gonna hit the sack i might as well good night i thought you said he was off the boat oh he was came back to change his uniform he was having that good a timey tor one i think i'll tag along just for kicks hello this is williams is andre there yes harry williams yeah did you pick up margot wayne no we haven't looked at either of the waynes yet but i have two men working on it all right listen i'm at the cafe only get that luggage maker and bring him over here right away i'll be waiting hurry right two officers sitting at a table asking if mcgrew the ensign is the one that bought the 48 cases regardless of not the answer the command jackson thanks that's right commander jackson himself and his aide mcgrew yeah cable reagan immediately for permission to arrest both of them then meet me on the pier we miss you laurel you stay here just in case come on amanda jackson you're under arrest sir closet i'll take that gun now mr williams who's your told pal get underway 315. amanda jackson united states navy you must be having quite a time for yourself even the security investigation division how far does your rotten arm reach what kind of an accident do you have plan for me or am i just going to disappear no traces no clues nothing maybe next time around we'll have better luck somebody will rig for dive right yes armin sir come in i'm talking about an hour see to them so um um hey come on quite a setup you've got here right in our own backyard take it easy fella imagine having the organization right here in washington where have you got it the capital is it the capital itself so hello well this is williams give me regan right away where mr regan anderson peters jumped out of the car and escaped pick him up a drugstore just off g street vons off g street right so great we're looking for him he's looking for us which came first the chicken of it mr williams is here sir send him in bad time yes sir come on sit down and relax jimmy you've been part of a war game the most vital one this country has ever had war game to test our atomic defenses and you hit on the answer before we were ready you mean commander jackson and enson mcgrew were the enemy that's right commander jackson is our expert on atomic demolition and you discovered i was the one who ordered the metal cases did you know this all the time hadn't the slightest idea until you cabled for permission to arrest jackson and mcgrew then we were informed it was a war game and why did you keep me captive on the sub couldn't give it away until the game was over and we knew how we stood for a while there it looked as though we had no defense against the real thing but it's finished now johnny and you did a great job that torn sleeve we weren't staked out for you i was slipping to last uranium aboard the sub when i ran into you and andre on a dock couldn't take a chance for a game you play pretty rough sneaking atom bombs into the country is a rough business look at that hot rod kid jonesy wargames accidents happen and the whole thing was make-believe even the suspects we picked up most of the military personnel trained for the job and let loose 48 of them to be exact 48 48 bags one for each state kind of symbolic huh 48th man wasn't picked up till an hour ago who was it buzz olin or leo wayne neither one wasn't all in the man you want to check an arrival in new york that's right well your request arrived after he did we still got a search order out for him who is this wayne leo wayne huh he's not on here i'm not surprised because he's not a part of your war game that's right buzz olin ordered four identical metal cases and brought three of them into this country with parts for an atom bomb when leo wayne meets up with buzz olen there's going to be the biggest explosion you ever heard because leo wayne brought in the plans for the assembly of that bomb that's what i've been trying to tell you all the time i was cooped up in the sub and playing hide and seek trying to get here are you certain the name leo wayne means nothing to the war games there's no one by that name in the overall plan and no one by the name of margo wayne either while we were playing games they were playing for keeps operating behind the screen we had set up they even penetrated your own crew i saw margo wayne hand microfilm to one of the seamen you sure you're not mistaking the games for the real thing check for yourself have margot wing picked up the luggage maker too he made 52 of those cases 48 for you and four for buzz olen get through to marseille yes sir you said something about microfilm then the plans for the assembly of the bomb must be on that film that's right that's a myth is it i've lost track of the days what day is it this is sunday night why because on tuesday at 3 p. m that bomb becomes real they still haven't been able to find the woman we haven't got much time we've got to locate wayne and olin before noon tomorrow how margo's contact on the sub it wasn't you could have been somebody else in on the war game commander jackson and i were the only ones from the sub in on the game and it has to be the seaman he should know where wayne and older headquartered i can't believe it's one of my crew if he's right we have less than 24 hours to get to them cancel on liberty order all hands back on board immediately hi sir has made on harm report one absence sir pharmacist mate owen harmon this mr maybe we question and double-check the entire crew except for the missing pharmacist mate and i'm satisfied all hands are in the clear then it could be the missing pharmacist mate owen harmon it's the only possibility but i don't see did he have access to any personal papers no all he did was keep williams out of commission under my orders no family or relatives none listed order an all-out search for this man at once yes by six o'clock monday evening they had tossed every spot of sale on my fancy then at 1010 p. m the body of a trusted pharmacist mate was spaced out of the potomac a wire about his throat and somewhere there was an a-bomb assembled loaded and ready waiting for enough precious seconds to be chopped away tomorrow would be tuesday another normal day in the life of a city that is until three o'clock in the afternoon margo strangled same pattern same methods one of silence to keep him from tipping his mitt the other because she already tipped hers that makes it complete no leads no hopes all errors and only two chances out of 160 million of ever catching up with we are wayne or buzz orlan fuzzo musician yeah get me the executive secretary of the american federation of musicians if he isn't in his office at this hour get him at his home it's urgent olin's a professional musician he can't work without his union card we'll find out which locally belongs to they may be able to give us a lead on where to reach him mr james c petrillo president of the american federation of musicians instructed the officials of the san francisco local to cooperate fully with the investigation i remember he called in some time last week and yes here it is he was out of town and he left a number for mr harrison to call long distance operator seven eight seven eight thank you uconn six seven one two six assigned to a party named rollins rollins thank you very much keeps to himself mostly used to teach high school until he quit runs a sort of uh rest home for a few people now manning you and reynolds go on that way clark hanson you two stay put come on let's take a look at mr rollins guests you stay here so fresh tire tracks follow them we see where they lead across the bay from san francisco 10 miles from this innocent little ranch house like the calm before the storm a city awakening and getting underway the sun climbing higher in the sky and only a handful know the truth but where do you go what do you do in an emergency of this sort is it the presidio that houses the bomb is the golden gate bridge the focal point of attack or is it the embarcadero san francisco harbor doorway to pacific traffic the ideal place for a bottleneck or the people themselves the very people in their parks their streets their homes and across the bay from the city the search went on time and a premium i'm glad to show you what it looks like inside i always did want to know what old ice houses were good for now you know where's leo buzz terror no go ahead big hero figuring on bringing your friends running huh you're a little late leo's delivering that prize package but no one's ever gonna find you hero i'll tell you where is he all right all right all right he's moving it in a black sedan headed for a private airport beyond the embarcadero block all bridge approaches leading to san francisco proceed with care leo wayne is armed got that right have a car meet us at the county line i want to transfer a prisoner and tell commander jackson to meet us at the airport we have a blueprint of the bomb all units vicinity of san francisco oakland bay area oakland bay bridge golden gate bridge attention do not attempt to apprehend black sedan without assistance do not fire on the vehicle proceed with caution relay all additional information of whereabouts to central offices it's set to go off at exactly 3 pm where's the time mechanism here's the trigger just under the casing but i'm afraid they crash it first before commander jackson gets a chance to neutralize it there he goes car ready to control we picked up black sedan he knows he's being followed on oakland bay bridge going towards san francisco relay instructions all units black sedan sighted on oakland bay bridge heading toward san francisco car 8-0 following so motorcycle units 411 and 414 have joined car 8-0 sedan headed for embarcadero uh car ready to control i've lost black sedan cars cross draw bridge we've been held up to all units sedan has crossed drawbridge car 8-0 and motorcycle units have lost contact black sedan heading towards sloane's airport we can reach the airport as fast as he can get to the cockpit hold it johnny use this come on get off the ground i can't they've got me blocked commander jackson's coming get him over here and clear the runway uh can you disarm it how much time do we have a little over two hours well i'm not sure you've got to be sure you just gotta drop it over frenchman's flat can you fly this thing i've flown them just about make it take it up to 10000 feet and stay there right ah uh how does it look for three o'clock i don't know we're fighting a headwind how much time do we have if my watch is right one minute we're over frenchman's flat shove it out and so it was but just within the shadows of san francisco a band of assassins were cut down before they could wreak havoc on the unsuspecting people and three o'clock is just the middle of another afternoon in the life of a city you
