THIS IS US, LORD! Comrade soldier, stop. Do you hear? What division is this? Where is your commander? I ask what division? The commander to me. Comrade Major. Eh? There is some kind of wonderful company. How do they go to the parade? Requires you. Well, send them. Let them go. Their officer is so arrogant. Requires! How. Postpone. Come on. I am the commander of a special detachment of the NKVD troops. Your papers, Captain. Remove the gun. And you take your place in the column. I don't smoke. - The kitchen would be disguised. - Let's move. Captain Ryumin. And don't linger. Move there. March to the trenches. They will aim at our rear. Move there. Where are we? In hey stacks, right? Company! Step march! Really, directly from the Kremlin? From the Kremlin, Comrade Colonel. 240 people and all the same height? Not less than 183 cm tall. Your weapons. Self-loading rifles. grenades and bottles of petrol. Everyone has weapon? And... won't the company get at least a few machine guns? Nothing. Nothing. Nothing, Captain! In addition to the kitchen and cartridges - nothing! It's almost the rear of the 4th line of defence. Militias. See who you have to fight. I see. Three-rulers are not for everyone. In this space the division should be located, and my regiment is extended. Your task - move forward 6 kilometres. Dig in. Don't retreat without orders. All. Permission to leave, Comrade Colonel. Go. Wait, Captain. Well, how is it... in the Kremlin? Hey brothers, where's my gun? It lays here. Not a gun, but a rifle. These are different things. How can you not understand. Yes, come and get it. One grenade and 25 rounds. You need to learn how to wrap foot cloths. You are a funny person. Come quickly. Well, let's have more fun boys. Comrade Lieutenant, come to me. The platoon to take up defence in the area: on the right - at the church. - Platoon, stop! - On the left - the edge of the forest. Open trench in full profile. In the shape of a semi-horseshoe with exit passages. To the church, to the cemetery, and... to that stone building. Do you understand the defensive plan? That's right, clear. This is the most profitable area. - What else? - Allow me to apply. What to dig, Comrade Captain? Bugger! What are you, hawks, just yesterday they took away from the pacifier, or what? So accurate... Yes. Open the trench by 6:00. - Aye. Lieutenant. Where are you running? I've been here before. Place the platoon in the last 7 houses. Ask if there are shovels, crowbars. - Aye! This is the most profitable area. Platoon take a position: on the right - the church. To the left is the cemetery. Open the trench in full profile by 6:00 with passages of communication to the church, to the cemetery and over there in that stone building. Well, dig, so dig. The third squad, lively in the huts, joking crowbars and shovels. Postpone. Position the platoon in the last seven houses. There you will find crowbars and shovels. Hold it. Comrade Lieutenant. Comrade Lieutenant. - What do you have? - See? Maybe it's their saboteurs who leaked. Shall we let it or what, Comrade Lieutenant? Not really. Well, these are our Slavs. Budko, Gvozdenko, follow me. May I help you, Comrade Captain? Let's work with your feet, friend. Come on with your feet. Whose rifle? Who is this? Nobody. Didn't understand? Don't ask unnecessary questions, Lieutenant. What, is he hurt? - No. - But what? He can't. It's not clear, is it? Where are you coming from, Comrade Captain? We got out of the way. No need to interrogate us, Lieutenant. People should be better fed. Two days without... Why here? Where, Lieutenant? When you leave the encirclement, you do not choose the road. Is that clear? Didn't understand... Where is the front? And where are you? Are you not at the front? Where are you? And where is your rifle, comrade soldier? I didn't have a rifle. I commanded a division, lieutenant. Get yourself in order. How are you standing? I am Major General Pereverzev. Who do you have, senior? What's the division? Take me to your commander! Pomkom platoon! - I. - Escort Comrade Major General to the commander. - Aye. - You'll get around. You will go yourself. - Aye. Comrade Captain. Go from the front line. Comrade Major General Pereverzev. I said, I thought... ah... he... Submit your documents. I... ask not here. Pull the squad out of the moat. All walking from there - around. Do not engage in conversation with anyone. And assign yourself a messenger so you don't have to leave every time. Your place is with the platoon. - Forward, march! - Aye. Budko, Gvozdenko, follow me. Well, are you boys cold? Budko, Gvozdenko, how are we with dinner? Let's do it now, Comrade Lieutenant. - Everything will be fine, Comrade Lieutenant. - First, first, me fourth. How do you hear me? Reception. First, First, I'm fourth. How do you hear me? Reception. First? Can you hear me? First, can you hear me? - Come on, Yastrebov. You are not on an exam. By the way. What did the Red Army soldier tell you about the front? Pereverzev? Did the cadets hear? They heard, Major General... Well, all right. Please explain to the platoon that it was not a general, but a soldier, shell-shocked. I installed this myself. Do you understand me? I got it. The situation is not clear, Alexey Alekseevich. It seems that the front has been broken in our direction. By 5:00, bring the platoon to full combat readiness. - Aye. Did you really hit it, Comrade Lieutenant? - Yes. Now the captain will not hurt us so much for this. Postpone. These were the scouts. And we found ourselves ahead of time. Well, to hell with them. Let them know. What do they know? And all! Let them know. Just think, we shouldn’t hide in stacks. Let them know. We will show them on which the pig wears a tail. Well, Yastrebov, didn't they knock them out? How, smoked one, Comrade Commissar. - Yes? And... you use their armour-piercing with incendiaries. Yes? - Yes. Half with simple ones. And the first smoked for sure. Well, let them know. The village ahead is occupied by the enemy, Comrade Yastrebov. The forces are, according to intelligence, significant. So I... I urge you, comrades in the Kremlin, to perseverance. Need to, by all means, hold out until the forces approach. This is shrapnel. What shrapnel? These are mines. Comrade Commissar, stay. - Okay, I'm staying with you, but you're in charge. Platoon, one at a time! Are you out of your mind, Yastrebov? There is an order. This is a retreat! Postpone! In places! Order better to remove the rifles. It'll hurt. Get the rifles off the parapet! Hawks! Hawks! Here am I. Now. Hawks, cut it off. Cut off. Well, please cut it off, Yastrebov. A... Beat me! Shoot, Hawks! - Now. - Hawks! Cut it off please. Please cut it off! Fast, fast. Shoot! - Yes, now I... - Yastrebov! Comrade Lieutenant, what to do? To his nurse. Faster. Carefully. Comrade Lieutenant, are you alive? You are alive? Are you alive, Comrade Lieutenant? Yes, I'm alive. Alive. Open them. Let's dig in. - Do you hear the rumble, Comrade Captain? - Yes. They've been buzzing since morning. Probably ours. The tanks are rolling. KV, maybe I recognise them by their hum. We would have had 4 pieces of HF. Then we would have rushed them for 20 kilometres. We would have probed them. These are not our tanks. - Why not ours? - These are not our tanks, Alexey Alekseevich. These are German tanks. We are surrounded. How... The Militia? - They are gone. - How so? - With or without an order, I don't know. Retreated. And we can't retreat. I'm saying this because I believe you, Yastrebov. And I know that no one in the company will know about this conversation. But you can't stay here either. Tanks from the rear are certain and senseless death. Senseless. I think that there is a motor-mechanised battalion ahead of us. Or something like that. The scouts saw trucks, buses. Maybe they are there on a temporary vacation. This is the plan, Alex. Throw ahead at night and go out to the wedge, to your own. - Oh, yes. But, this is just a plan. Nobody should know about it. Do you understand? I... I understood everything. How connected? Didn't come back from the regiment? Neither did not return. I already sent a second one. Comrades of the Kremlin! I received an order this morning. Command order: destroy the enemy motorised mechanised battalion that is in front of us. Exit to the area of ​​the wedge and link up with the regiment to which we are attached. We attack at night. There will be no fire training. The wounded are ordered to be left here. They are to be evacuated by another unit. Platoon commanders to me. Pomkom platoon, disperse the people and prepare for the march. Left! Step march. To the village occupied by the Germans. The company will approach from the south side. And at half past four stop at the bottom. It's right here. I order the fourth platoon to go to the edge of the forest in the northern part of the village. And having taken up defence there, fire five shots at the yards and huts by armour-piercing incendiary cartridges. Then the second, first and third platoons rush to the attack. The fourth platoon remains in its position. And point-blank shoots naked retreating fascists. Now they will run. Now we have them. Attention. Platoon! Attack! Behind me! Threw up. Hooray! Hooray! Platoon! Behind me! Run! Run! Forward! Bottles! Bottles them! Give it back! Give it back, prostitute, to whom I say. I killed you, give it back! Who am I talking to! Give it back! Uskov! Well! What are you, shoot! Give it back, prostitute! Go. Go. Ein, zwei. Ein, zwei. Ein, zwei. Ein, zwei. Ein, zwei. Ein, zwei. Ein, zwei. Ein, zwei. - Where do you take them? - Available Lieutenant Gulyaev. Budko. Budko. Yes? Come to the main platoon, find out how they are there. Understood Ein, zwei. Ein, zwei. Ein zwei. Ein, zwei. Ein Zwai. Ein, zwei. Well, Leshka. They tore them to pieces. Understand? Von took it out. Smashed it. Where is the captain? - There. Yes. Bugger, you understand? They settled down here, bastards, they sleep in the same underpants. What about the prisoners, Comrade Captain? Shoot them. Run! Hawks. Alive? Well done. Well! Now the most important thing is to get out of here. Platoon! Behind me! Here! Let's go boys. Faster. Faster. Don't linger. Come on, come on, faster. Accompany, to me! Run to Captain Ryumin! Bastards. Come on guys. Come on, come on. Not six. Eight. Don't stop. Well, they took it. Faster, faster boys. Into the thicket. Go deep into the forest. Yes. Yes, be patient. Well, be patient, mate. Dissolved the bore. We'll take you to the hospital. That's it, Alexei. Now you understand - we couldn't just leave. And if we make it to the night, then everything will be all right. And if... - The scouts. The scouts have returned, Comrade Captain. Comrade Captain, the village to the east is called Red Yards. Ours are gone. The Germans were not there. Send for water at the village, drinks for the wounded. - Gvozdenko! - I! - To me. Get to the village for water. Give me. - Don't shoot. - Comrade Captain. Allow me to climb a pine tree and hit it with a bottle. Nobody will hear. Do not shoot! Do not move! Do not look up! Come on, read it. Come on, read aloud. I'm sorry, what? Open your eyes and you will find the answer. You will see that your struggle is beneficial only to your leaders. - You bastards! ...Only they expect something from the Stalinist system. Only they... Boys, what is written there? Bastards. Yes, there is no hell... in your hands leaders... - Hitler is calling in captivity. And the pass is this: beat the Jew, the Commissar's face asks bricks. What, what? Like Pushkin. Fistyushkin. Listen, Alex. We did not leave the area. Of course it is possible. Try to go east in a column. Wounded ahead. Happy? In an open place? At least 200 metres closer to their own. No! It is better to meet them here in the forest. After all, the forest is our ally. Hold on until the evening. Company, attention! Prepare for battle! Fourth Platoon move the wounded there. Into the hollow. First, second, third platoons! Take up all-round defence at the edge of the forest. Did you realise that you knew how to fight? Comrade Lieutenant! Comrade Lieutenant - Planes over here! A lot of them. - Come to the wounded. - Aye. Attention! Air! Faster! What is he, his mother! Started, and now... No. No. They won't kill me. They won't kill me. No. No. No. No. You have nowhere else, right? Imposed? Or injured? Quiet you. Tanks. Where is your SMG? I ask you 'Where is your SMG'? Here. Here. And a German machine too. And yours? - You! You! - Quiet. Tsh. - Your soul. What are you! Comrade Lieutenant. It is you. Comrade Lieutenant. I've been here for a long time. Don't be afraid. They pass by. Don't be afraid, Comrade Lieutenant. - Get up. - Comrade Lieutenant, they won't find us here. - You'll see. - Get up. Get up. Everyone is dying there and you are here! Get up! Go! Well! No need. No, Comrade Lieutenant. We can't do anything. We need to stay alive. Do you hear? We are their reptiles then all... We are their reptiles then, like last night... - Get up! - Well, shoot. Shoot then! Or let me first. It's better to do it yourself than they wounded us afterwards in captivity. Well shoot! Psycho! Quiet. Comrade Lieutenant, Comrade Lieutenant, do you hear? So a fool will eat porridge, there would be a spoon. Are they fighting with what? Mortars, dive bombers and tanks. It is you who should tell what they are fighting. And how we fought today. You will report too. And now none of us fought, Comrade Lieutenant. And I have nothing to report to anyone. - I spent the whole day lying alone in a funnel. - One? And where was I? I don't know. Little... There, someone fired at the Junkers all the time. From a pistol. Looks like he hit one. - Maybe it was you? Eh? - From the bastard. Rota died, and he... - From the bastard. - Yes, who needs it, so that we also die. Germans, right? Do you know what I'm talking about? Maybe I know. About the NKVD, probably. Yes. Exactly. And about my and your conscience But my conscience is clear. Last night I honestly planted three of them one by one, like pretty little ones. And there was no one from the NKVD with us. Neither yesterday nor today. - And how are you, many yesterday? Eh? - One. Skinny as a skeleton. They groped, didn't they? Checked documents. He was an officer. Ah... And I'm a fool and did not think about the trophies. One here is just a machine gun and grabbed. Germans. There they are. See? Theirs, theirs. Come out. Well, I told you. - Captain! - Alexei. Everyone... nobody else. Finally. All... No one else. Go, go. Go. - These are the same stacks. - Yes. - There was still the NKVD. - Yes. Yastrebov, we don't need to go there. Wait. - Stay on guard. - Aye. There should be machine gun nests. And here. All. Come on, Comrade Captain. - What? - Come in, and I will tie a plug. Scoundrel. All this was shown to us back in Spain. Scoundrel. We cannot be forgiven for this. Never. Comrade Captain. Comrade Captain. Nothing, nothing. We them... We them... Then. We have them then... then... like... then at night. We have them all later. We still have them vomiting. Still not so oblivious. Behind us is the Urals, Siberia. Have you forgotten? Ural and Siberia. Yes, us and then all the reptiles. Would smoke. So this is me now. Now. The boys have. I know. Well, how did you rest? Like mother-in-law. OK. I... will come later. Comrade Lieutenant. Wait. Hold on, this is for you and the captain. Keep it under the bottom, otherwise it will fall out to hell. I... I'm just like that. I wanted to smoke. Where did he get to? What's the difference. Where will we bury? We need it under the maple. Where can you find maple now? Well, then away from the stacks. Over there. Gvozdenko, stay with the captain. We will dig here. - Give me the bayonet. - Yes, that's enough for you, Comrade Lieutenant. - We'll dig ourselves. - Give me the bayonet. We need to move the captain. Aye.
