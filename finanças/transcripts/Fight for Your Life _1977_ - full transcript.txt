Ready to copy? - Ready to copy. - [Dispatcher] They're driving a stolen brown '76 Mercury, New York license 229NHY. Last seen headed north. Rodriguez, Chino, male, Hispanic, 5'4, 145 pounds. Priors include assault, manslaughter, first degree murder, due to serve 75 years. Chow, Ling, male, Oriental, 5'8, 170 pounds, scar left side of face. Three counts child beating, two counts murder in the first degree, two counts arson. And Jessie Lee Kane you've heard of. Consider all three extremely dangerous, especially Kane. Chief wants you to stop at Ossining, pick up the files on all three. Oh, and while you're there, see Tony Carson. I understand he's a friend of yours. He did six months as Kane's cellmate last time around. See if he'll give you anything. [radio static crackles] - Hello, Tony. How are you? - Well, jerk me off. If it isn't Rule Book Reilly. What the hell you want with me? Or are you here on a social call? - Look, Tony, I was just doing my job. - Oh, skip it, crud. You know you kill me? You go through the war with my old man, and he saves your life, so you owe him one, right? No. Not you. Not Rule Book. No, you catch me comin' off the highway with a trunk load a' weed, and bust me. - You'll be up for parole soon. I'll put in a good word for you. - Big fuckin' deal. You know my old man died of a broken heart 'cause of what you did? - Look, Tony, your father was my best friend, and I'm sorry, but that's over and done with. - Yeah, well, it's too late for that, pig. - Tony, if you were innocent, you wouldn't be in here. - Really? Well, what do you want from me, old buddy? - Jessie Lee Kane's broken out. You were his cellmate and I need your help. [Tony chuckling] - [Tony] Fuck you, pig. [chuckles] - Look, Tony, you know how bad Jessie can be. Want that animal out on the loose? - What do you want from me that you can't get off the rap sheets? Huh? He's a murderer. He kills for the fun of it. [laughing] He's a rapist. [clucks tongue] Oh, mmm. He does that for the fun of it, too. [laughs] He's the most miserable, mean, toughest louse you'll ever meet. Oh, and he fights dirty, too. [laughs] And you know what, Reilly? You deserve each other. [Tony laughing] [laughing] [door clatters] - Why? - 'Cause, punk, I said so. You gonna listen up and learn somethin' or what? - All I was sayin', man, is how come to Canada for? - I already told you that, because I'm the boss. Besides, I got brains over you. Hell, if it wasn't for me, you'd be wearin' your gray pajamas by now. I tell you somethin' else, if you don't like it, you can get out and walk. I'm gonna slip my ass across the border into Canada. - Oh, no, man, that's right with me, you know? I want to go there. I'm stickin' with you, we gotta stick together, man. You got the smarts. I'm stickin' to your brain. Man, I do have a question for you. If you so smart, how we gonna pay the toll? Look! They gonna get us now, man. We got no money! - Go up, get over to the right, shut your face, spic. Here, gimme that nigger's rag. I'll be, that jig ain't got a deuce in his grouch bag, do you believe that? - Well, what we're gonna do, man? What we're gonna do? They gonna send us back, man! I don't wanna go back there! No way, man! - Fuck, eh? What happens now? - Shut up, I told you! [Ling chuckles] How much? - 50 cent, you got the money? You just killed a cop, man! They gonna get us, man. [tires squeal] - Dammit, hurry up, man. - What? Hurry up, man, we're getting close! Come on, gimme the money! Come on! [Ling laughing] - Keep it in your pants. Oh, shit. [bell dings] [upbeat funky music] [crickets chirping] [dog barks] [electric knife buzzes] [cutlery clinking] - I'm not gonna eat 'em. - Well, young man, that's no way to guarantee yourself a piece of that delicious pumpkin pie we're all having for dessert. - You better get crackin' at that veg, you young whippersnapper, if you gonna be world champ. [laughs] - World champ? Bring on the rest, 'cause you know I'm the best. And let met tell you, that ain't no supper, 'cause this here's the home of the Whopper! - That's about enough of that, Floyd. Strength isn't everything. The Lord said the meek shall inherit this earth. - Hm, amen. - I'll tell you where it's at. Black power. That's where it's at. - That's right, Granny! Black power! Right on! - Now you eat the rest of your salad like your papa said. I'll go out in the kitchen and get that pumpkin pie. The meek shall inherit the earth. [scoffs] That's a pile of nonsense. Is that gon' be in your sermon Sunday, Deacon Turner? - Why, you all know it is. It's in the middle of the second page. Course, if you've forgotten, I'd be more than happy to deliver it again. - Oh, Daddy. We've heard it 10 times already, and you don't have to give it for two more days. - The good word never wears out its welcome, child. - Then you do want to hear it again. The lessons of brotherly love-- - You're gonna be doing that sermon nonstop till Sunday. Promise me you won't do it when Karen comes for dinner tomorrow. - I don't know why you had to go and invite that white girl into my house for family dinner. - [Daughter] She loved Val as much as we did, and if wasn't for that car accident, she woulda been one of the family. - Well, I like her. - I think we all like her. She's always welcome in our home. Isn't that right, Louise? - I suppose. Come on now, Corrie, you, too, Floyd. Give me a hand here so we can get on with dessert. - I had a fight with the great Ali, I'd splash on my boot, and I'd kick like Bruce Lee. [pained screaming] - [Chino] Don't waste any, bitch. [wet stabbing] [grunting] - [Jessie] Come on, come on, and duck, baby! - [Chino] Shit. Come on, hurry up, move your feet! [low, urgent music] [engine rumbles] [tires squealing] [stabbed man groans] [clunking] [birds chirping] [crow caws] [door slams] - [Dispatcher] We've got an update on your code 36. - Yeah, what do you got? - [Dispatcher] Looks like your boys ran low on gas last night. - Driving that big Merc, it doesn't surprise me. What they do? - [Dispatcher] They hit a gas station, ripped off the cash box, stabbed the hell out of the attendant. Lost a lot of blood, he's still in critical. - Get a make? - [Dispatcher] Very cooperative, made all three of them. And given that gas station last night, we think they're still in the States. - Good. - I'm going into town on church business. Anyone want to take a ride? - Um, I wanted to head over to Joe's to pick up some wine for dinner, but I'll take my bike. - 'Kay, suit yourself. See ya later. [phone rings] - I'll get it. Hello? - Hello, Corrie? - Hi, Karen. - Is everything still go for dinner? - Everything's all set. Only come by early so we can visit a little first. - Listen, are you sure it's okay? I mean, I know your mom wasn't too excited. - Listen, I wouldn't have invited you if the invitation didn't come from all of us. Now you listen, girl, you come on over like you're supposed to. - [Karen] But I know she holds me responsible. - Not at all. She knew how Val was with the car. Look, that's all water under the bridge, so come on. - [Karen] Okay. You know, I really do wanna come. It's just I don't wanna make anybody uncomfortable. - Hey, girl. - I guess you're right. - You just get yourself here on time. - [Karen] Okay, I'll see you later. - Bye-bye.

[bell jingling] - Hi, Corrie, how are ya? - Hi, Joe. - What can I do for you? - I need a white for dinner. [baby coos] Hi, Sandy. - Wave hello, sweetie. How 'bout the Leedfer Milk? Or would you rather have the Ripple? It's your grandmother's favorite, just ask her. - Hey, Joe, you jivin' me. - [Joe] I told you, ask your grandmother. Did you want that chilled? - [Corrie] Nope, don't need it till dinner. - [Joe] Let me take care of these gentlemen, okay? - Sure. - Mighty kind of you. - That be all? - No, as a matter of fact-- [wrappers crinkling] How 'bout emptying the cash box, neighbor? [Sandy crying] - Sure, fella. Anything you say. Just don't excited. - Well, that's the ticket, nobody get excited. Now just put the money in the brown bag. Do it slow so I can watch those hands. That your baby? - [Joe] That's right. - Sure is a pretty tyke. Shame to make her an orphan. Just do like you're told, ain't nobody gonna get hurt. [gasps] [gun blasts] [Sandy crying] [bottles crashing] [crashing] [worrying music] [Sandy crying] [bills rustling] [Corrie gasps] [gun clicks] - Don't do it, man. - I don't want no little witnesses. [Sandy crying] [gun clicks] [Jessie laughing] I know'd it was empty, but I had you goin', didn't I? [chuckles] [Sandy crying] [worrying, doomed music] Now let's go. - Don't give me any trouble, senorita. [bell jingling] [engine rumbles] [tires squeaking] [tires squeaking] [water rushing] [dog barking] [low, brooding music] - Now we put the cuts together and shake opposite hands. It's done, we're blood brothers. - Well, slap me five, bro. - You know, this is for keeps. No matter what goes down, we're gonna be blood brothers for the rest of our lives. - Yeah, well. - [Friend] I did say your brother was pretty brave, going to Nam and all. - My dad's always saying that a really brave guy walks away from a fight whenever he can. He didn't even want Val to enlist. - Well, my dad said him and the other cops down at the station, they really thought Val was pretty brave. How did he win that medal? - Yeah, well, hey! - Come on, put 'em up. - Cut it out will, ya? - Put 'em up, come on. You're askin' for it. Hotdog, hotdog! [dog barking] Hotdog! - [Floyd] Hey, man, hotdog's for real emergencies. - I know, but-- - No buts, man. It's for real emergencies only, and if you're crappin' around, how will I know when it's serious? - Yeah, I guess you're right. Thanks. - Hey, man, what time you got? - It's about noon. - Aw, darn. I gotta go back up to the house and do some stuff. We're havin' company for dinner. - Hey, will you be able to come down later? - Yeah, but come and get me. The less company talk I have to listen to, the better I like it. - [Friend] Okay, see you later. - All right. [light, uneasy music] Come on, Tad! [dog barks] [train horn blowing] [bell dinging] - Is that you, Ted? I forgot to ask you to get me some sugar, because I'm-- - Afternoon, ma'am. Mind if we come in? - Who are you, what's this all about? - Jessie Kane, ma'am, and I'll ask the questions, you understand? - Now what's all this ruckus out here? - Afternoon, Granny. Where's the rest of the family? Chino, check upstairs. Ling, check out the back rooms. Where's the car? Tar baby here says you got wheels. - My husband took it into town. He'll be back soon. - Anybody else? - My son Floyd, he's out playing in the woods. - Nobody else is home. - Good. Watch the front door and let me know when that car turns up. - Please leave us alone, we haven't done anything! - No, but we have. Now shut your yap! And sit down over there on the couch! - Now who in the hell are you comin' in here, givin' us orders? - I'm the law as long as I got this thing. [Corrie sobbing] [clattering] Who is that? When's he comin' back? - That's my son Val. - He'd a' shown you if he was here. He ain't never comin' back. He's passed on to a place where you'll never go! Amen. - Well, he's the lucky one then, ain't he? - Hey, man? There's a kid and a dog coming to the front door. - That's my son Floyd. Please don't hurt him, please! [dog barking] [dog growling] - All right, everybody stay cool. We ain't gonna have any problems now, you understand that? [dog whining] - [Floyd] Hey, Mom, who belongs to that neat car? [idle funky music] What's goin' on? - It's our car, boy. Now get your ass in there on that couch and sit down. [dog barking] You may be brave, kid, but you ain't got nothin' upstairs. That dog bite? - Chew your throat out! - Lady, don't push me. Chino, put that mutt in a closet. I don't want Ling messin' with her. [horn honking] - Perhaps the father. [dog yapping] [uneasy music] - All right, no trouble, people. [dog barking] [dog whining] - Hello! Where's everybody hiding? Who belongs to that beautiful car out there? Louise? Do we have company? - Company? You better believe it, burr head. Now get your ass in here. - Who, who are you? - Jessie Lee Kane. Pleased to meet you, nigger. Go on, shake it. [dog whining] I said shake it, spade. [Chino chuckles] - My name's Ted Turner. What do you want of us? - Pleased to meet you, turnip. Now move your ass over there on the couch and I'll lay it all out for you so there ain't no misunderstanding. - What do you do? You bank robbers? - Shh. - [Jessie] Right smart boy you got there! What you say your name was? Turd, is that right? - Ted. - Yeah, Uncle Remus, that's what I thought. Turd. Now like I was sayin', we blown away a whole lotta folks between us, and a few more here and there don't make no difference to me. But with all them squirrels out there on the road tryin' to hunt up our ass, it just don't make sense, bein' out there where they can grab us. So we gonna hang out on the line, visit with y'all a spell. Then when it gets a mite dark out, we gon' take your car-- - Amigo. [clucks tongue] [Jessie speaks in foreign language] Like I was sayin', if everybody behaves nice, entertains us and is hospitable, ain't nobody gon' get hurt. [Chino chomps] So you understand? - All right, we'll cooperate. But just don't do anything to hurt us! - That's the kinda talk I like to hear. But just in case anybody changes their mind, takin' any chances. [phone clatters] Chino, Ling, pull out the rest of 'em. Now then, Aunt Jemima, how 'bout movin' your ass out to the kitchen and rustlin' us up some soul food? I said move. [dog whining] Now we makin' some progress. By the way, any o' you coons wanna tie the feedbag on? I said any of you black-ass coons hungry? What is this? You people are supposed to like to eat! Any o' you black-ass coons hungry? - Yes, we're hungry, if that's what you want. - No, that ain't it at all, you black-ass booger. [chuckles] I don't wanna force you. Now let's try it again. Any of you black-ass coons hungry? - Yes, we're hungry. - Close, monkey face, but not quite on the nose. I say any o' you black-ass coons hungry, and you supposed to say, "Yes, master! "Us black-ass coons is all hungry." [Corrie sobs] Now you got that? All right, here we go. Any o' you black-ass coons hungry? - Yes, we're all-- - Don't sell me short, turd! I'll do it, and you know it. [tense music] - All right, you win. Yes, all of us black-ass-- [coughs] - No, no, you got it all wrong. Come on, I want it loud, and I want it sassy, and I want it now! - Yes, sir, master. All of us black-ass coons are hungry. - Good, that's what I thought! Now let's go get some grub, y'all! By the way, I hope you folks don't mind, but I invited some friends o' mine along. You got any objections to eatin' with a chink and a spic? - Man, I told you, don't call me spic! - And I told you don't ever tell me what to do. [spits] I'll blow your brains all over the fuckin' wallpaper. [gun clicks] - Easy. - I'm hungry. Let's eat. I said let's eat! Now sit the fuck down. Don't be a jerk, turd. - You said if we cooperated, nobody would get hurt. But I tell you now, Kane, if you push me-- - Bitches, I know what you're sayin'. I just wanted the little lady here to sit next to Master Kane. You'd like that a whole bunch, wouldn't you, missy? [Jessie chuckles] That's right, let's all make ourselves at home. Moms, what's to eat? - [Louise] Macaroni and cheese, is that all right with you? - Don't get uppity, bitch. Serve it, and I do mean southern style. - Ahh. [dishes clinking] [Chino speaks in foreign language] [sucks fingers] [Jessie chuckling] - What's the matter? Nobody hungry? Go on, eat up! [dishes clinking] - Lord almighty, bless us, this our daily bread, and grant us forgiveness in this world. Amen. - And make us ever mindful of the needs of others. Good, that's over, now fetch me somethin' to drink. Not you. Him. I'm the master of the house, and I want the head nigger to fetch me a drink. Go on, boy, get it. Oh, crap, never mind. Ling, I left that bottle in the car. Go get it, chop chop. [chuckles] Chop chop. [Jessie chuckling] - You see how mad the little one gets when you get mad at his father? - Hey, little. [hiccups] Don't take it personal, you get yours later. [dog whining] - Fat geek! There ain't nothin' left for us to eat. [Jessie snickers] - Here. You want it? My country, we eat garbage. Scrap from the floor. But here, I am the king. [Jessie laughs] And I want you to eat from the floor, you to eat from the floor, and you to eat from-- - Eat this! - You motherfucker! - You the funniest old bird I ever did see. - Look what she did to me! - Settle down, King Chino. - But she-- - I seen what she did, and it looks good on you. Now sit down. [Jessie chuckling] Now finish eatin'! [spitting] - You poor white trash. You didn't have that gun, you'd be a yellow-streaked bum! - You may be right, but while I got it, I'm king o' the roost. [Jessie chuckles] Besides, if I feel like it later, I may put this down your throat and break out the rest a' your teeth. [Sandy crying] - [Dispatch] 4912, 14, 242. [static drowns out radio chatter] - [Radio Cop] 71, 14 and crew. - [Dispatch] 239. [Jessie coughing] [exhales] - You know, I just don't understand you people. We come in here out of the blue, we take over, and we do bloody well what we want, and y'all just sit there like brown dirtballs on a fender. [chuckles] Fender. I mean, what the hell is it with you people? - I won't lift a fist against you, Kane. All I want for my family and myself is for you and your friends to be out of here, out of this house and out of our lives without anyone bein' hurt. That's all. No more, no less. Is that too much to ask? I want to know that, Kane. - I don't give a rat's ass what you want to know, king coon, and I'll tell you why. [clattering] I never asked for nothin' from nobody, and that's what I got. Nothin'. You hear me? Nothin'. Not no money from my tired old spineless father, 'cause he didn't have nothin' to give. [sniffs] He didn't die, my pap. He got so tired of tillin' his two acres, he just melted into the soil. [Jessie sniffs] Even the state, the God almighty state, they give you a place, a cage a' your own. But you know what they take in exchange? They rob you of your manhood. You oughta know what I'm talkin' about, pops. They cut you off between the legs. You got any idea what it's like to be thrown in the hole when you're just a boy? Thrown to the animals? Well, let me tell you, it ain't no picnic. [tense music] [mournful music] Once, there was a woman. I thought she was gonna give me what I wanted. 'Cause nobody ever give me nothin'. I had to fuckin' take what I wanted every time. You learn not to stop till you get it. Now don't you worry the fuckin' kinky hair off your head, 'cause soon as it gets dark out, we gon' tie y'all up in the cellar. Maybe take us a hostage, huh? I like that! I like a woman with spunk. - I'd die first, you bastard. - I want you to know something, Kane. You can take any material thing we own, but when you get ready to take your hostage, you'd better take me. - Well, you just about the most cooperative darkie I ever did see. What school you go to, Scrape and Shuffle U? [laughs] - Daddy, stand up to him! - Shush, boy. - Put him away! - Your daddy's right, boy. Which you rather be, a dead black man or a live jive-ass coon nigga? You think on that. [Jessie hiccups] Your daddy's a fine, upstandin' man. He's a bend-over-backwards and shine-your-shoes-master coon. You watch and you learn. Why, your daddy's so cooperative, I bet he'd even shine my shoes. How 'bout that? You wanna shine my shoes, darkie? What's the matter? You not interested? - The measure of a man is dignity. - The measure of a man is power! Now lick my boots, nigga! - No, no! - Sit down, boy! - No! [bell jingling] - [Dispatcher] Car nine clear, 242, 7114. - You oughta know better. - He's not gonna need it where he's goin'. - You oughta know that disturbing anything at the scene of a crime is a chargeable offense. [snapping fingers] - You must be Reilly. - [Reilly] Chief Hamilton. - They told me to expect you. - What do you got? - Lab people are goin' over the place for prints, and we'll have a ballistics report in about an hour. - How do you know it's my boys? - Had a couple of passersby who saw the brown Merc out there that fits the description. - Okay, so my boys have been here. Anything else? - Yeah, did you notice that bicycle out front? - Yeah, in passing, why? - Well, around here, people don't just leave a bike like that for a couple of hours and disappear. - You're saying they have a hostage. - I'm saying I think so. [Jessie snores] [phone line beeping] [Chino snoring] - [Operator] Yes, can I help you? - [Karen] Yes, operator, I've been trying to reach 736-0266 for about two hours, and I can't seem to get through. Could you try for me please? - [Operator] I'll check the line. - [Recording] This is a recording. There appears to be a receiver off the hook. Please check your main telephone and extensions. Thank you. - [Operator] That line seems to be out of order. We'll report it to our service department. - Ling, what's wrong with you? [Ling speaks in foreign language] - [speaks in foreign language] My ass! [both speaking in foreign languages] - Now, now, boys. No fightin'! Trouble with these good folks is they don't know how to host proper-like. Look at 'em sittin' there. Fine bunch o' deadbeats. Hey, Chino, you know what we need? We need us some good old down home entertainment. Now which one o' you jive-ass spades wants to do a jig? [Jessie chuckles] Get it, jig doin' a jig? [chuckles] No, man, I ain't kiddin'. I really do want to see one of you do that dance. Come on, don't be bashful! Now who's gon' dance for us? - [Chino] How about the little one? - How 'bout you, Floyd, you wanna dance for us? Well, that's a right shame. Better not let the news get out, you'll give the race a bad name. Oh, hell, I know how to dance. I can teach any one of you. Come on, let's have a volunteer. [bottle swishes] How 'bout you, pops, you wanna dance for us? - I'd really rather not. - I don't give a rats ass what you'd rather do, now get up! All right, give that booger a fuckin' hand! [clapping] All right, pops. Come over here. Now watch this. [chuckles] All right, now you try it. Hey, pops, you been holdin' out on me! Come on, let's hit it. [Jessie chuckles] All right. How 'bout that? [clapping] Now pops is gonna do it solo, huh? Dance, God dammit! [gun bangs] [gasping] Dance! [Jessie chuckles] [Jessie clapping] Nobody told you to stop. Dance! [Jessie chuckles] [gun bangs] Oh, hell, that's enough. Everybody, let's clap for him. [clapping] Tough findin' appreciation even at home, huh, pops? [chuckles] Aw, anyway, it's time for the musical portion of the program. Pops is gonna sing for us. Ain't that right, pops? - I really can't sing well. - Can't sing well. You tryin' to hustle me, pops? - I know I can't! - Now get your ass up on this stool and make like a black canary. All right, good. All right, sing! ♪ Mine eyes have seen the glory ♪ ♪ Of the coming of the Lord ♪ He has trampled out the vintage ♪ ♪ Where the grapes of wrath are stored ♪ ♪ He hath loosed the fateful lightning ♪ ♪ Of His terrible swift sword ♪ His truth is marching on ♪ Glory, glory, Hallelujah ♪ Glory, glory, Hallelujah ♪ Glory, glory, Hallelujah ♪ His truth is marching on - Shut up!

Floyd, go ahead and get rid of him. Don't say anything funny, or your friend and your whole fuckin' family buys it. [low, tense music] [doorbell dings] - Hey, Joey. How are you, man? - Where the hell you been? I been waitin' for you down at the fort for 20 minutes! - Well, I kinda decided not to come out, so I'll see you later, huh? - You sure? There anything wrong? Maybe you had a fight with your father? - No, it's nothin' like that. I'll see you later, huh? - Okay, anything you say. - See you later, hotdog. - Who're you callin' a hotdog? - You, ya hotdog. - Very good, little coon, you kept your cool. [low, tense music] [gun clicks] [Jessie sighs] - Hotdog's for real trouble. I wonder if he was just crapping around. [crow cawing] [Jessie chuckling] [dramatic, worrying music] [Joey screams] Leave me alone! [Joey whimpering] [whacking] Get, get off! [whimpers] [whacking] [Ling panting] [low, tense music] [police radio chattering] [Reilly sighs] - Ah, this your boy? - Sure is. - Maybe he could help out with that bicycle angle. - You know, you may have something there. I'll give a ring home and see if Joey's around. - How many deserted buildings do you have in the area that would hide their car? - Hmm, about a dozen, maybe two in the immediate area. - Hello? - Hello, dollface. How are ya? - Fine. - Hon, is Joey there? - [Mrs. Hamilton] No, why? Do you need him? I think he's out in the woods with the Turner boy. - Well, if he sticks his face in the door, have him give me a call. - [Mrs. Hamilton] What is it? - You tell him he may get to help me solve a case. Love you, bye-bye. - [Reilly] Well, no luck? - Nah, he's out playin' with one of the kids in the neighborhood. Hey, what do you wanna do about those abandoned factory sites? - Do you have the man power to cover 'em all? - Yeah, if we do 'em one at a time. - Do it. - John? - [John] Yeah? - Tell Wilson and Morris to take a car from the hill and check out those old deserted factory sites. I want that car. - Know what gets me? - What's that? - Looks like a hostage number, and nobody's called in a missing person. - Yeah, beats me, too. Maybe that bicycle hasn't got anything to do with it. - Get many abandoned bicycles up in this neck of the woods? [phone ringing] - Yeah, I see what you mean. - Yeah, I tell you what. Let's get in the car and go have a look-see at some of those buildings. I get itchy just hangin' around here. [door slams] - Why, howdy, stranger! Come on in! Where the hell you been? [Ling panting] - There was a boy, too. - Joey! What happened to Joey? - I smashed him with a rock. He is dead. - And the girl? - She was strong, she ran fast. - You let her get away? You fool! - I chased up a hill to a train bridge. There, she resisted, but I was persuasive, and she submitted to me. - Ahh. - Oh, no! She wouldn't. - But she did. She wears lacy underthings, and she kisses with her tongue, and her hair was golden in the sun before she gave herself to me. - It's a lie. It's a lie, she would never! [sobbing] - Then I broke her white, lovely neck and threw her into the river. [Corrie sobbing] - All right, now listen, first we gotta get rid of that car. - But I thought we could put it in the garage, man. [spits] - No, I don't want anybody amblin' by to check on the coon family singers here. No, we stick in the woods now while there's light to see by, then when it gets dark, we move. - You mean it, man? And we go to Paris? Gonna make it? - [Ling] Break your bottle. - Hey, pops, you got any gas in that rig? - I filled it downtown. - That is a shame 'cause I was gonna have you suck-siphon the gas, see how much you swallow, then light you up like a torch. [Chino chuckles] Chino, you go with pops in their car. Ling, you go in the Mercury. Stick it deep in the woods, and when it gets dark, we'll move. Get a move on, pops! And remember, you give them any trouble, you get shot, and I'll cut their throat and delight in it. Now move! - You in a big hurry? - What now? - Well, you ran a red light, you're not in pursuit. Technically, you could be charged. - Be shot at sunrise. What's with you, anyway? Never met a cop like you. You climb on every violation like it was first degree. - Look, I don't care who breaks the law or what law they break. Everybody gets the same thing, that's the name of the game. It's not my job to figure out whether or not the guy's got a good reason. That's up to the courts to decide. - Precious little good they do. We ought to kill half the bastards that walk through our doors. Make life easier all the way around. - Not my job. A guy steps out of line and I bust him, and that's it. If he's right, that's up for the court to decide. - [Dispatch] 1621, 1621. - 1621. - [Dispatch] Got a brown Merc under observation, cruising Oakwood, headed north, New York plates. Over. - Could be our boys. 1621, we'll intercept at intersection of 24. Request a backup. - [Dispatch] Special unit two is running parallel on Roger Street. He'll back you up. - 1621 request car-to-car. - [Dispatch] Go ahead, 1621. - Calling unit two, 1621. - [Two] 1621, unit two. - Don't push until we get there. Lay back, I wanna make it stick. - [Two] Unit two, done. [police siren wailing] [dog whining] [coughing] [dog whining] [Jessie chuckles] [dog whining] - Now where the hell do you think you're goin'? - To the toilet if you have no objections. - Objection! Ain't nobody movin' till I give the say so. Y'all understand that? - But I have to go-- - I'm runnin' this show, Deputy Dawg. Now sit down. But if you raise that hand and wave it a bit, I might recognize you and give you my permission. I see your hand, but I don't recognize the owner. [chuckling] You keep it up there. I'll let you hit the pisser when I'm good and ready. Now where you goin' king coon? Junior? - I wasn't goin' anywhere, I was just stretchin'! - Keep it up there. I wonder where in the hell the troops is. They oughta be back by now. - [scoffs] Maybe they run off and left ya. You got it comin'! - Nobody asked you to open your hole. Shut it! And as for you, little coon, come over here and park your ass on that kindling. [low, tense music] Now you sit. [Jessie chuckles] Golly, if you don't look like you belong there. - What're you talkn' about? - You, little coon. You a nigger in the woodpile. Now you stay there. And when the pervert and Chino get back, I'm gon' put Martin Luther coon right there next to you. You'd be a father and coon act. [chuckles] [chuckling] Huh? [sobbing] [kindling clinking] [Jessie laughing] [cracks] - Corrie, quick, get knives! Don't you move, you gray garbage! Stand right right there or you'll get poked! - If you ain't the fastest little nigger I ever seen! If you'd a' been stronger, you mighta done damage, boy! - The rest of us will. You do as you're told. - Gimme a sticker for that pink pig! - Now what? - Now we wait till they get back. [horn honking] [low, brooding music] [police siren wailing] - [Hamilton] We're in pursuit north on Central Avenue. We'll intersect at intersection at 24. - [Two] Unit two, 10-four. [tense, uneasy music] [police siren wailing] [tires squealing] - All right, come out with your hands up! It's all over. - [Mercury Driver] Don't shoot, don't shoot! - All right, come on, come on, up against the car. Spread 'em! - I was only doin' 40 miles an hour! I was just lookin' for an open gas station! I only had three drinks. - Is this our dangerous killer? The plates don't even match. - Book him. - Come on, he's not one of our boys! He's scared shitless! - I said, book him. - Fine, what for? - Speeding, failure to comply, and drunken driving. [tense music] - You heard the man, book him. Bring him back to the station, we'll deal with him later. - All I was doin' was tryin' to get some gas. Don't call my wife. I want my lawyer. [doors slamming] - If this ain't the damnedest nonsense I ever saw. What in the hell do you think you're gonna prove? Now when they come back here, I'll be forced to shoot the lot of you. - Shut up, honky, or you're gonna bleed. - Ha! That's a laugh. You wouldn't do it if you had to. You're yellow as your pop. - Shut up! My pop's not yellow. - [chuckles] Come on, boy, stick me. - Be careful, Floyd. - Come on, do it! [Corrie gasps] [Jessie chuckles] 'Kay. Chicken, boy. Drop the knife, boy, drop it! [Louise whimpers] Put 'em all on the couch, now! You got more guts than your old man. I'm proud o' you! So proud of you, I'm gon' make an example out of you to your old man. When he comes back here, he's gonna find you hangin' from the nearest tree. - I'm not afraid of you, Kane. You wanna hang me, you go right ahead. - What do you want from us, Kane? Our respect? That will never happen, but we won't resist you again. Now you leave him alone! - Maybe you're right. I mean, he's so young and willin', probably wouldn't do nothin', wouldn't teach him nothin'. So I'm gon' hang you instead. How'd you like that, Deputy Dawg? How you like that, Floyd? I'mma hang your mama 'stead o' you. - If that's what you mean to do, then do it and be done with it. [low, tense music] - [Ling] [chuckles] Well, I hope Kane is right. - We don't have a choice. We're here. Pull in slow, pops. [birds calling] [Louise crying] Hey, hey, hey! Where you think you're goin'? - That's my wife I hear. - Sounds like a real fiesta to me. [chuckles] - I'm goin' whether you like it or not. [crying] - You're not gonna hang my mommy! [gun bangs] Daddy, you all right? - I'm okay. What's happenin' here? - Shut the hell up! I'm in charge here. What'd he do? - He was trying to get cute, so I scare him a little. - Yeah? Well, I'm sick and tired o' all these games. I'm gonna teach these people a lesson they won't forget! Come on up, woman! [Chino laughs] - Kane, I will cut her down! You're gonna shoot, do it now! - Shoot him. Shoot him! What's the matter with you, you dumb spic? Shoot him! [Chino laughing] Get your ass up, get up! [Louise wailing] [Chino laughing] Get your asses up there! [Louise wailing] [Ling chuckles] - [Dispatch] 1621, update on your code one. - [Hamilton] Go ahead, control. - [Dispatch] Wife of the victim gave us a probable ID on the bicycle. Belongs to a Corrine Turner, 112 Fury Road. - [Hamilton] Skip it! I know the place, my son plays with their kid. And notify the state police, we'll be in radio contact. [police siren wailing] [sky rumbling] [gulping] [Jessie exhales] [exhales] - What the hell is this? God and brotherhood? Who the hell do you think you are, Martin Luther coon? - I'd be honored to follow in the footsteps of Dr. King. And yes, I'm committed to the Lord. I believe in God. - Well, it won't do you any good with me, 'cause I don't. - And you'll get your just rewards in this world or the next. - It's all a crock of shit. [paper shredding] Pure manure. You ass holy rollers are in for a big surprise. - Maybe... it's the other way around, Kane. - Oh, yeah? You ever been to heaven? - No, I-- - So how in the hell do you know it's there? - Faith. [scoffs] - Faith. [chuckles] [tense ambient music] This is your good book? - Yes. - Says here you're supposed to turn the other cheek. That right? - That's right. - Well let's see you turn your damn, turn, mother! Turn, turn, turn, mother! - [crying] Oh, God, please! Ted, Ted, Ted, Ted! - Daddy, Daddy! - I've had it with you, Kane, you cotton curtain dung heap. You're nothin' but a two-bit, cork-poppin' rear end of a sow. You oughta be locked up in a looney hole till you stink to death. I ain't afraid of you, Kane, 'cause that's what you gonna need 'fore I get through with you, a cane! - You toothless old bitch. [bible thumps] You couldn't beat a dad man in a footrace in that hand-pusher. - And you couldn't put this brood up against the wall without that gun. You're all just fakers in a whore house. - And what's that, old woman? - A little boy with a banana in his pants. [chuckles] - Shut the fuck up, bitch! - You two-legged yellow dog. That's what you are. Come on, shoot me! Shoot me. But I'll tell you somethin', mister poor white trash, you ain't nothin' but what you got in your hand, and your pappy shoulda thought about that before he stuck it in your mammy. - Shut up! - [scoffs] I'm just gettin' started! Why, you're gonna be tracked down like wild animals in a jungle! - You may not care about yourself, old hag, but you sure as hell do care about the young ones. And you make one more sound, and I'll blow this girl's brains out! Now you think on that. - That's showin' her, amigo! Yeah, man. - [sighs] Damn right. - Man, when we gonna get the hell out of here? - We wait till dark. Then we take the jungle bunny's car and grease on through the darkness. They'll never catch us. - Do you know a place to go? - You bet your ass. [chuckles] What do you think, I'm makin' it up? The whole thing, just waitin' on us to happen. I know the border, I've got the contact. You stick with me. Jessie Lee gon' take good care o' you. My good buddies, by tomorrow night, we'll be outta the country, and day after tomorrow, out of the continent. [chuckling] Hey, Chino, you ever been to Paris? I understand they got the hottest little numbers just walkin' around askin' for it. [Jessie chuckles] [laughing] Come here, bitch. - Get off my sister! - Don't move. I got you right where I want you. Now we gon' see if black womanhood is up to white manhood. [uneasy, tense music] - [Floyd] Leave her alone, you bastard. [car doors slamming] [rifle cocks] - [Officer] Rescue's standin' by, and the state police choppers are on the way. Reilly'll get back to you if he needs more fire power. - [Cop] 10-four. - Is the power on? - It's lit. - Just hope it works this time. - Set? Good. - Come on over here, bitch! [Corrie crying] I'm gonna get me a little of what I been waitin' for all day. [Corrie crying] - No. No. [Corrie whimpering] No. No. No. [Jessie grunting] No, no, please. [sobbing] Please, no. No. [sobbing] [fabric shredding] [whimpering] Please. [crying] [Jessie grunts] No! No. Oh! [tuner beeping] Please. [sighs] - God, I know those people in there. Feel that chill. - Yeah, looks like more rain, maybe. How good is that audio extender? - We haven't had it that long, it's unpredictable. - No, no, no, try that. [broken crying] [Corrie wailing] [birds calling] - How was it, Kane? - Well, she don't like it a whole hell of a lot, but it was mighty fine for yours truly. [Jessie laughing] [Louise crying] You get in there and do your business. - Watch the little one. - He'll sit right where he is or he'll get his. [birds calling] [static crackles] - No, no, no, no. Try that. All I'm getting is static. [Corrie yelps] - Some of the boys in the back say they saw some action in one of those rear rooms. Said it looked like someone screwing. I know those people in there. I think we oughta get in there and shoot it out. Lord knows what will happen if we don't go in. - Lord knows what'll happen if we do. - We have to charge the place, use the gas, too. - Look, Hamilton, this is my show, and we're gonna run this my way. You say you know those people in there and you wanna save 'em. Well, I know those convicts, and if we rush that place, those people are gonna be dead before we hit the front porch. I don't wanna see innocent people die. We can't take the risk. - If were in charge-- - Look, insubordination in the field is a damn good way to lose your tag. We'll wait a while longer. [Hamilton sighs] - [Chino] Man, she was a tight one. - I'll say. Here, Floyd, have a tug. [Louise sobbing] Go on. [Ling chuckling] - [sobbing] Oh, God, please help us. - [Jessie] Good luck, Romeo! [low, brooding music] - [Officer] Oh my God. [somber, limping music] - Where are you goin'? - To get some water. - Oh, let me. [splattering] [Jessie chuckling] [tense music] [Louise sobbing] [low, pondering music] You guessed it, pops. While you was away, I felled my first black oak. You know, she was the first virgin I've seen in a long time. Don't trouble yourself, pops. - [Officer] I'm sorry, sir. - His kid? - Yeah. [Hamilton screaming] - Hamilton, don't do it! Come back! Shit! [Hamilton screaming] Hold your fire! [glass smashing] [guns blasting] [pained groaning] [Hamilton grunting] [glass shattering] [gun blasts] [low, urgent music] [Chino grunts] [smashing] [Hamilton groans] [banging] [Jessie groaning] [Jessie grunts] [gun clicks] - Don't move, or I'll blow your motherfuckin' balls off. [tense music] - Well, now, Master Kane, let's try it without the guns. [Kane whimpers] [whacks] [Kane shouts] [dog barking] [whacks] [groaning] - I'm coming, Tad, I'm coming! [spraying] - Attention, in the house! Kane, Ling, Chino! I'm Lieutenant Reilly. Will you turn loose the Turner family? - [Louise] Let 'em in. We're free. - Not yet. - [Louise] It's over. - It's only the beginning. [gun clicks] Now it's our turn. - Well, what's it gonna be, Kane? You gonna let 'em go? Chino, there's no way out except to give up. - Come on, I want you to answer him. [Chino groans] [Chino speaks in foreign language] Now you answer him. Tell him you're not comin' out. [Chino grunting] Now you listen, spic, and you listen good. I may not be always with this thing, but I can hardly miss from this range. Now you answer, you tell him you're not comin' out. - I'm not coming out. - You don't remember well! You're supposed to say it loud and sassy. Now answer him again, louder. - I'm not coming out! - [Reilly] Rodriguez. Chino, is that you? - Tell him yes. - [Chino] 'Ey! - Don't be a fool, Rodriguez. Give it up. Let the Turners go! - Now if he makes one step towards the house, you're gonna start killing us. [Chino panting] [gun cocks] - If you make one step to the house, we're gonna start killing them! - Hold it, slit-eyes! [dog barking] - Uh-huh, so this is the way it is, huh? Look who's got the gun. Love-thy-neighbor his self. You're yellow, pops. You wouldn't pull that trigger if you had to. You might. - Don't think I would? Push me, honky. Find out. - Just like the rest of your race. No guts, no nerve. You might have it big between the legs, but you ain't got no balls. [Jessie whimpers] - They move, blow 'em away. Where you goin', Master Kane? Ain't gonna make old Turner come get you, are you, boy? No, Master Kane, that ain't no way to thank Aunt Jemima for all that hospitality! [Jessie whimpers] My daughter sends her regards! [whacks] [Jessie grunting] - Oh, no, no! - Don't tell me you gon' turn the other cheek like this black-ass mother did! [Jessie grunting] [whacking] - Hold your positions, but be ready to move in. I want men on the north and on the west with tear gas grenades. And make sure our people are masked. - [Cop] 10-four, we're ready. - Good. But first I want to try this the easy way. I don't wanna lose any more people. [radio static clicks] If you harm those people, it's only gonna be worse. Send out the Turner family now. All right, have it your own way. We're moving in in 10 seconds. [tense music] [guns clicking] [dogs growling] [dogs barking] - Officers! - Holy shit, hold your fire, dammit. - Officers, please, don't come in! [dogs barking] They're gonna kill my mom and dad! Oh, please, don't come any closer! - [Amplifier Cop] What're you gonna do now, sir? - Well, we'll give 'em a few more minutes, and then we'll try pushin' 'em again. - You heard right, stand by. - Have you got that damn thing fixed yet? - [Amplifier Cop] No, might be a minute. Could be an hour. - Fine, fine. I hope nobody does anything rash in the meantime. [electric knife buzzing] - I don't need help anymore. I can do it myself. You know, Kane, I was never with a man before today. But I know you're not for real. You ain't even big enough to cut off. - That's not true. I'm more a man than any of you. - No, you're not. [Corrie panting] - [Chino] Grab the knife, Kane! Grab the knife! [footsteps clomping] [gun blasts] [crashing] [Chino wailing and groaning] - All right, no more killing. Throw the gun out the window, and then you come out. This is your last chance. Let the Turners come out, and then you come out, or we're coming in. [static crackling] [broken groaning] [whacking] - You killed Joey. [Chino screaming] My best friend. My blood brother. - [Chino] God! My balls! - [Floyd] And you killed his daddy, too. - [Grandma] There wasn't no call for all this wasteful dyin'. - [Louise] But killing isn't all they did. [sobs] You ruined our daughter's future. You done me more hurt than if you shot me dead! [Chino groans] You broke my heart when you forced my girl. [sniffs] Now, it's our turn. [pained groaning] 'Cause, Lord, there ain't a law stronger than an eye for an eye, and there ain't a thing on earth gonna keep me from what I have a right to now. Nothing's gonna stop us from getting our revenge. - [Cop] You hear anything, sir? - Nothin' much at all. Damn thing ain't hardly workin' at all. [clicks] We'll wait a while. [birds calling] - Do the rest, if you're going to! - [Radio Cop] Did the helicopter get it here, too? - [Radio Officer] I'm curious. See if you can ready the chopper, say you're goin' 'bout a quarter of a mile south. [pained groaning] - All right, we can take 'em alive or we can take 'em dead. I want 'em alive, pass it on. [rising, exciting music] [dogs growling] [rifle cocks] Fellas, you're with me. Let's go. Time to break up this free for all. - Hurry, Ted, he's coming. [pained groaning] [grunting] Oh, no! - [Ling] I'm gettin' out of here! [smashing] [groans] - That's it, Deputy Dawg. Don't give me no trouble. [Ling choking] [pained groaning] Come with me, nice and slow! You're my ticket outta this trap. God damn, looky here! How you say, we got us a regular reception! [chuckles] Let's nobody be stupid. I got mama and I'm gettin' outta here, you got that? - How far would you get, Kane? Give it up. - I ain't never givin' up! [Louise whimpering] Now you get me a car, and you pull it up here. Right now! Call all them cops back. You hear? [Louise whimpering] Do it now! Loud! So everybody can hear you! - You heard the man. Pull back and hold your fire. - All right, now get me some wheels, fast! - Couldn't we-- - You wanna see this woman die, cop? - All right, all right, don't shoot. We'll get you a car. - That's better. - Kane! Kane. [groans] Don't leave me. I'm dyin', man. [groaning] I wanna go to Paris. - Amigo! I only got one ticket, and it's got my name on it! [Chino grunting] - [Policeman] Get that car up here! - Pull it up! I'm gonna want a clear roadway out, too. You tell 'em I'll ventilate her head, anybody get in my way! Hey, mama, how'd you like that? Now hurry up! Hurry up. When we leave, I ain't gonna be by myself! Little mama's gon' be right behind the wheel! And I'm gon' have the gun behind her head. [Louise whimpers] Now pull that car up! - Where you goin' with my wife, Kane? - Oh, nigga, what a surprise! Me and the missus here'll take a little trip, you hear to see us off? - Leave her, Kane. Take me. - What would I want with you, nigga? You so worthless, I could end your life here on earth if I wanted now. - Why don't you shoot? What's keepin' you from pullin' that trigger? - You surprise me. Don't you know it wouldn't be courtly to shoot an unarmed man, even if he is black, huh? [simmering showdown music] - Give me a gun, and let me die with dignity. - Don't make no difference to me how you get it, coon. - Turner! [heroic music] - God damn, you, Kane, I can whip you. Now let go of my wife and meet me man to man in a fair fight. - Ain't never gon' be a fair fight, coon! Everybody knows whites are naturally superior, boy. - Then let her go. Prove it, white trash faggot! - Who you callin' a faggot, nigger? - I heard you say as much. Young boy going to jail at 16? He's sure to get taken advantage of. That what happen to you, Kane? Some big, black boogeyman stick it to you, boy? I knew you weren't a man! - I am, I am! They never got to me. I fought 'em all off! - Never? Ever? - Hmm, oh, no. - [Ted] Can you prove it, boy? - No. - Are you sure? What about that woman you say loved you? Did she really, Kane? Why ain't she with you now? I'll tell you why. Because she didn't want you. 'Cause you got nothin' to give! - Shut up! - And that's what you hate. Men with wives and children! Men who've proven their manhood. - I am a real man. I am! - Prove it, boy! - I hate you. - I hate you! - Hate you, hate you. - I hate you! - Hate you, hate you. - I hate! - Hate you! - [Screaming Man] I hate! - You're just like the black man my mama run off with. I'm gonna shoot you! - Louise!
