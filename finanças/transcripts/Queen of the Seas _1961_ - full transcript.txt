STAGING POST Excuse me. Never mind. Is everything okay, coachman? Security service. At the king's orders. Hello. Is everything okay? You disturbed our sleep. It is better than being robbed. Watch out, there is plenty of bandits around. What bandits? I'm travelling alone and no one ever stole me a brooch. What brooch? My brooch! My jewels! I've been robbed! Stop! Where are you going? But I... Sorry, we've been disturbed. Insolent! You won't feel like joking after some time in London prisons. Hands off, henchmen! He's your partner, isn't he? This old simple-minded? Arrest them all, I'll be in good company. Take him! You can go. Me, old simple-minded? What a way to behave! Open. Here's a new guest. Turn back! Calm down. The warden has convincing methods with troublemakers. Welcome. Who are you? My name is Peter? And you? Marius. A gentleman... What does a gentleman like you here? I've been caught. A thief? That's what they say. A prosperous thief. Me? I'm from a good family. Well, well... The aristocracy of thievery. Stealing is an art, you know. Transmitted from father to son. You're different from the other men here. Thanks. And you? How long have you been here? Not long. Anyway, everything was wrong. I don't have your traditions. Tired? Okay, we'll see tomorrow. What? You don't want to rot here all your life... No, but that's not up to us. If you want to refresh yourself, you'll have to do with that. The Thames water. Take your clothes off. No... I'm tired. Well... Good night. Good night. They finally brought the soup in the courtyard. How is the food here? I wouldn't call that "food". You have beautiful hands, Marius. And a nice face. You must had gone on many women's head. Women? That's my weak point. Mine too. I can't resist a woman. Fresh skin, sweet perfume... Slender ankles and legs, prelude to the grace. Stop it, that's enough! What's the matter? I'm speaking about women. Round and velvety shoulders... When I speak about women, I mean you. - When did you understand? - Last night. You wanted to conceal it while we may stay here all life. What's your name? Mary Read. Mary Read? The woman bandit? Some call me this. You're not only stealing jewels, but also hearts. - I... - Nothing at all! - Leave me alone. - What if I keep going? What would you do, screaming? To let everyone knows? I won't scream. I can defend myself. I won't do anything to you. I'll do, if you keep going! You're strong. And what's this? It's mine. You got me, huh? I didn't notice anything. ''From lord Goodwin to his dear son.'' Where did you steal it? To lord Goodwin. They busted me for that. And you keep this kind of thing with you? When you're caught, it's better give back what you stole. Especially if it belongs to a lord. That's the only way to hope for mercy. I don't want anyone's mercy. Out. Meal time. Line up! Hurry up! Stop! The stench troubles the warden. Do you want to end up in penal colony? Thanks again and goodbye. How stinky! They look like rotten worms. Pick up three of them to make them clean up. You. You... And you. - You can't. - Why? After it's finish, you'll have to undress and wash yourself in front of the warders. Thanks. All the stables. I never brushed the ground so much in my life! But for you, I can clean up the stables every day. What does this rascal want? I wouldn't be in his shoes. Hey you, the warden wants to see you! Not you, the one called Peter. Your Lordships are too kind to come at this our. It's only a thief after all. Who pretend to be lord Goodwin's son. So? You don't know those bandits, milord. They would make up anything to get away. Let him in, we'll know the truth. Well, milord. Come in! The son of a lord, with this look of coward and assassin... - Hi! - You found quite a place to stay! A lot of girls are crying. But we'll tell them that you look like a coward and an assassin! I feel like staying another night. Why, do you like it? Life is like a dream in this prison. - Thank you, sir - You! - A cigar! - Right away, milord. Here, milord. How dare you give this trash to the son of a lord... I didn't know that... Is he really lord Goodwin's son ? Are you still doubting it? No, God forbid... Your Lordship, your appearance, your noble features... Can you explain us, Peter, how the hell did you end up here? For countess Bacon's ball, I disguised myself as a thief. Milord, be merciful, it's a tragic mistake. All right. This morning, I cleaned up your stables. Tomorrow, you'll clean up mine and we'll call it even. Thanks, milord, thanks. They'll be polished... Polished. Are you coming or do you prefer to enjoy our host hospitality more. I'm coming. But I first have to go back in my cell. Farewell, Mary. Why? Where are you going? They let you go? No, the lord manifested himself. They'll put me in another prison. Peter, the torture! You must give the medallion back. No, it's too late. Take it. In memory of me. - Come on, Peter. - Hurry up! Help! I'm dying! Hurry up, save me! What is it? What's all this din? Help! Help me, I'm dying! Hurry up, I'm dying! - What's the matter? - The door is stuck. Come on! Come on! Help me! Stop or I shoot! I must see milord. His Lordship doesn't receive tramps! I bring this back to him. It belongs to milord. I'll give him myself. Where did you took it? Did you steal it? No. Someone gave it to me. I'll tell everything to His Lordship. Would you announce me? Follow me. Don't touch anything if you don't want to taste the whip. A funny story, believe me. Too bad it was so short. You're incredible. Will Mary Read stay locked for long? If they recognise her, at least six years. And else? She'll be out in five or six months. I was wrong. She's clearly already out. A poor blind... A poor blind... Grandfather... What do you want from a blind? To help him cross. Mary ! Let's go, we're not safe here. - Do you have a fianc?e ? - No... - I bought this for you - For the jail? I was sure you'll be out after two days. You're my granddaughter. - You have talent. - I know, grandfather. I must leave this place To where? - Far away. - Where? Where there's no lord and people like this. What would we steal without them? Prison just give people the need to flee away. Tonight, we'll get drunk at the Golden Gallon and you'll forget all about it. - Grandfather, I don't feel like it. - You'll come. Tonight, we're celebrating captain Poof's return. The luckiest king's corsair. So? Okay, we'll go Fine! Excellent! Who are you, the queen of England? She's much more. It's my granddaughter, Mary Read. And I am captain Poof. I like you. Come. Come on. Come. Next time, take off your hat in front of a lady. Good... You get everything you want with good manners. I'd like my corsairs to be well dress like you. I precisely wanted to have a word with you about that. Will we drink something? Most honoured, milady. Hey you, give the lady a seat. Please. Captain, I want to board with you. You? Is it a bad idea? No, on the contrary, it's a terrific idea. Yes, but... - As a sailor. - Precisely. The prettiest sailor ever seen on a boat. Is it? Perfect. He's coming too. What? The granps is coming with us? Captain, who do you thing taught her how to use a pistol? Silence! Shut up! You're hired. Both of you. And now, let's drink to the king's new recruits. Sorry. Enough! A real sponge! Cheers! Captain, you'll cruise offshore north and central America. His Majesty and myself wish you good luck. Thank you. And thanks the king. Assure him I'll steal only on his name, as always. Anchors aweigh! Ready to sail away! Be careful of the ropes, over there! Hurry up up there or I come to kick your bottom. Captain, we're ready to take our duties. - Can you cook? - Me? Enough to have all the crew drool over for it. Good. Go quickly in the kitchen. You, come with me. Your place is in my cabin. Poor captain Poof... Captain, this is my cabin. Out. Your cabin? God almighty, are you kidding? It's my cabin. Mine! Don't move! Keep quiet. I'll obey you only concerning the work, is that clear? Crystal clear. Then get back on the deck. On the deck! All this goes in the hold. Sailor! Get up there and take in the sails. Well, captain. Shut up! Take your positions! At work! Birds of ill omen. - Anything else, captain? - No. Can I go put my things in the cabin? Yes. Out of my sight! Taste this broth. It's a secret recipe. I called it "consomm? eat-tripe". I got it. Then came a girl and a old man. She took his heart and kick him out of his bed. You are mine. The bed, the cabin, the ship, everything is mine. Why can't you understand? I like passionate women. Captain! Captain, a Spanish ship. Damned! What are you looking at? Get back to your position, you bird of ill omen. We'll go back to that later. Ready to open fire! Steer to starboard. Stay on that course. Take your positions! At your orders, captain. Go back to your cabin, you don't belong here. I can take care of myself. Fire! Full speed ahead! Those pigs have the wind with them. Prepare to board! Mary, that's some idea you got... Unlike them, we belong to the land. Mary ! Captain! - Captain... - Mary... I finally succeed to have you loving me. For this only reason... it bothers me to die. Surrender! You'll be treated as prisoners of war. Surrender! Or we'll kill you all. We surrender. We surrender! If we have to go to prison ours are better. Tug the sloop. Lock the prisoners in the hold. Let go of me! Is that what they call Spanish gallantry? Women... Always ready to sell themselves to the highest binder. Coward. You'll feel sorry for saying that... Come on. Keep moving! Madam, please forgive the harshness of my men. Who could think a flower was hidden among this scum. I hope you're not keeping flowers in the hold. No. Allow me, don Pedro Alvarez da Costa, duke and Grandee of Spain. Please accept the hospitality of my cabin. It's an honour, captain. The prisoners are in the hold. Repair the damages of the ship. And don't disturb me. Please come with me. Here, my pretty lady. This is all I can offer to you. But everything is at your disposal. Everything is beautiful, here. The nobles have refined taste. Thank you. You're flattering me. What's your name? My name's Mary. Mary... You are beautiful. Your eyes are like the sea. You don't lose your time, captain. I'm a sailor, my dear. You are the woman of my dreams. Keep dreaming, my friend. Your wakening will be violent. It was a close shave, today. At least, the captain got his reward. It's Mary. Can you hear me? Here's the keys. Open without a noise. Slowly. Somebody replace him. We'll attack them one by one. Arm them as we go along. Quickly. Go. Hey, Manuel... Ready? Let's attack together, they'll have no time to react. To the sea! Good luck, friends. What are you waiting for? Let's hail Mary Read! Friends, as we are risking our lives let's do it for ourselves, not for England. - She's right. - We'll get rich. I'm taking the command and the name of the dead captain. You'll call me captain Poof. Our freedom of movement will be bigger. Long live captain Poof! Hurrah! I love your skin. And your slender ankles, prelude to the softness of... Peter... shameless as always. No, my dear. Only when I find a flower like you. I love your shoulders. Round and velvety, prelude to... Oh, Peter... I like dancing with you, but... there is too much people. Lord Goodwin, the lady is here. Miss Elisabeth, glad to see you and honoured that you accepted to come. Milord... We'll be more comfortable in my sitting-room. You know... Please excuse me, miss Elisabeth. We'll be away from any indiscreet looks and you'll can rest a bit. I should refuse, but... Peter just made a new victim. He probably didn't had to struggle very long. A single minuet movement. No, there's too many people here. Come. It's much better over there. Where are you taking me? But it's a bedroom. Is it that important? I adore you. You're the most beautiful woman in the world. It's not true but I'm glad to hear you say it. You must believe me. You're the most adorable creature in the world. Your eyes reflect your soul. You know, I'm in love with your soul. - You're looking for it in my corsage? - Why not? The soul hides in the most secret places. You reach it from the body. Peter, every lie becomes true on your lips. Relax yourself. Don't think about it. I love you. Do you really believe it? I wouldn't believe it if I were in your shoes, miss. But you, milord, you'll never be in my shoes. Father, it's not nice of you. Go, my darling, we'll resume this an other time. Go, now. No, Peter, there will be no other time. - Is it? Why? - Because that's enough. You're the shame of the family. At your age, I already campaigned against Cromwell. You're not even at the Academy. I refuse a military career. Then enter the Church. Me? Come on, father. Why? You won't be the first... There's only one other way in this case: marriage. That's the lesser evil. Very well. I already chose a wife for you. A noble woman, with a significant patrimony. As you wish. Do you agree? I don't have the choice. - I'll announce your engagement. - Thanks! So who's the young lady that will be my wife? Wake up, you sleepyheads! On the ground! In the saddle! On the ground! Faster, you sleepyheads! In the saddle! On the ground! In the saddle! Stand straight! Trot two and two! Gallop one by one! Jump, you sleepyheads! Jump! Jump, damn it! Jump! Did you see? Do like your mate Goodwin does. Let's go, miss Elisabeth. Our little Peter is turning into a real Goodwin. Don't shoot. Let's try to board it without destroying it. Full speed ahead. Hoist my flag! Pirates! Tiller to starboard. Take in the sails. - Quickly. - How terrible, they'll kill us. Take cover. We'll try to escape them. Pirates... How exciting! Will they be honourable enough to spare the girls? Take cover. Cannons don't know anything about gallantry. Look, it's an English ship. I never attacked the English before. Be careful, we have a treaty with them. lvan, there's only one treaty we know: the prey. There's no difference between Spanish and English nobles. With my cannons, I can crush it in no time. We're here to pillage, no to kill. Aim for the mainmast's base. Fire! Stop! We have to resign ourselves. We can't face them. Stay calm and we'll maybe save our lives. What an adventure! Their chief is maybe an handsome young man, like in the novels. Do I look good? Take down the sails, hoist a white piece of cloth. They are surrendering! Board gently. Weapons out. Let's go Milord... My ship is yours, but you are wasting your time. I'm not a lord and my cargo is ordinary. I wouldn't say that. Check the hold. Miss, why are you travelling on this tub? Just by accident. I'm expected in Florida at a party given by the viceroy. And you're crossing the ocean just to go to a party? Are you French? - You are beautiful. - And you, nice. Who are you? His Majesty Louis the XlV's first dancer. I'm coming from Versailles to dance for the viceroy. Captain, there's only cotton in the hold. And these things. Holy Moses, all this for nothing! It doesn't matter. You have nice dresses. How does it look on me? It's perfect, Mary. Take the girl on board and free the others. What a way to behave! I'm coming on my own will. Let's go back on the sloop. We'll sail towards Florida. Why? f the loot doesn't come to us, then we'll go to it. And now, ladies and gentlemen, the star attraction of the party: a surprise coming expressly from the court of Paris. Now I understand why the court of France is so much talked-about. It's scandalous, we should stop her. - Indeed. - It's indecent. Hand's up, stand still. Stop that joke, miss. Don't move. Here comes the best part. Come in! I won it. The king himself never had such a show. Don't do anything stupid. You enjoyed the dance, isn't it. Now it's your turn. I take this... And this. You lose some jewels but you have plenty more in your safes. Hands up, come on. Come on! Both! Forget it. Some shows are against my principles. Be ready to leave. Don't move if you want to stay alive. Say it. I let you a brooch, isn't it? More honest... Speak louder! Everyone must hear you. More honest can't be! Good, now I have a clear conscience. Long live captain Poof! Long live captain Poof! Opening bid: 100 ounces of gold. It's not enough. Tell us what to do. Our lives are yours. You're gonna live old, you have my word. What are you doing? Breastplates are totally outmoded. It's not a breastplate, it's a throat-guard. A lot would love to slit it for 100 ounces. They're looking for captain Poof, not for you. How would they know it's not me. Those people slit first and ask next. As I'm always near you and look like a chief, they'll think I'm the captain. Any orders for the steersman? We'll stop all the ships coming from Europe. Why not. But I'm careful. I'll keep my breastplate until I retire, and a wool knitwear also. Mary... It's you, lvan... Why are you looking at the sea, every night? I don't know. It helps me remember. You're not happy, Mary. - And I... - Please, don't say anything. I believed those words once, and I'll never believe them again. Maybe some day. Thank you. Get back to your position. Well. Officer cadet Peter Goodwin... As you obtained the maximum of points, by the gracious will of his Majesty, I name you first class captain and I leave the cruiser New England in your hands. We need fearless men to put an end to the activities of the felon corsairs. You're leaving for America in 15 days to free our colonies from the most dangerous pirates. Captain Goodwin, do you have any objection? None, sir. Ship at starboard. It looks Spanish. This ship fly no flag. It's a pirate boat. What are your orders? We keep our cape. We could destroy it in no time. I know, but our mission starts in New Bristol. The governor must be impatient to see civilised people. Why would we give ourselves trouble before? It's a powerful ship, we can't fight it. Mary, it starts to look bad for us. Let's return and get back to our respectable work. Tiller to port! Hoist the Portuguese flag. - Are we running away? - Full sail. Let's hope this stronghold forgets about us. We go back to San Salvador. Hoist! Welcome, captain. We weren't expecting you so soon. Did you heard of a 60 cannons cruiser? Morgan, l'Olonnais and Blackbeard came back because of it. They want us death. - I almost bumped into it. - You saw it? Invincible. All of us together couldn't manage to sink it. Yet, we must try. It's there for us. What else do you know? The captain is Peter Goodwin, it is said he swore to destroy us all. - Say that name again. - Of that miserable? - Say that name again. - Goodwin, the son of a lord. - Are we gonna cross him? - In New Bristol. This is where the information is coming. - Where are you going? - In New Bristol. They'll arrest you. Even a women should fear the gallows. A sword won't turn a coward into a brave. Nobody will know. All the nobles are going to be there. I don't like it. I'd prefer do the job from inside the coach. Help... Bandits... What's happening? She probably has been attacked. Nonsense. There's no bandits in Florida. Get off and hands up. Get up. Step back. Don't play hero, I don't want to ruin your clothes. I have nothing with me. I'm going to the governor's party. You "were going"... How pretty you are, miss. Raise your sweet little hands. - I am a woman! - Who said different? Take your clothes off. Tell us who you are. Take my clothes off. Me? Quickly. The clothes, we won't hurt you. Who are you? You're disrobing the count of Berry. She is my ward. Of course... You are going at the governor's party. - Is it correct? - Yes. Does he know you? The duke and the duchess of Welcott. The marquis and the young marchioness Salvatierra de Castilla. The count of Berry and Mademoiselle Duchamp. The nobles from Gold island. Excuse me, Your Excellency, who is this lady? I don't know, captain. I arrived recently. Such a beauty deserves a better company. Please excuse me. Do you allow me, Mademoiselle? Count... I... don't have the words to describe your beauty. But you seem to know how to speak to women, though. I had a curious idea about the colonies. In London, they are believed to be savage lands inhabited by those who want to run away from justice. It could be the truth. By the way, who told you I wasn't a thief? Stop joking. I can make the difference between an adventurer and a great lady. Yes, of course. The garden has really lovely areas. Do you want to see them? Actually, I'm with the count of Berry. He doesn't look unhappy. A bandit get in and says: "Hands up!" I raise my hands... to catch him and lay him low. I tell him: "No foreigners in my coach". When I saw you, I felt like we meet before. Among so many women... None is as adorable as you. Why are you laughing? What's your name, Mademoiselle? My name's Mary. Mary... It's an English first name. Come on, don't tell me you forgot your repertoire. Slender ankles, prelude to the softness of the legs. Velvety shoulders... Mary, the prisons of London, the medallion! - You! - Me, Peter Goodwin. You've been a long way, from seducer to captain. So as you. From the London thief to the colonies' tart. You're right. I can't reproach you anything. Forgive me. Now that we met again, give me another chance. Of course, Peter. I'll give you all the chances. But why did you come here? My father wanted to give me a wife. I'd rather took the command of the New England with the mission of crushing the pirates. But now that I met you again, we'll go back soon. Soon? How do you plan to defeat the pirates, without experience? There will be no battle. Poof is the only dangerous pirate. I already have a plan to get him. But it's gonna bother you... No, it's very interesting. How do you plan to capture Poof? No one succeeded. Its' a simple plan, but efficient. A few fast small ships are gonna wait for the pirate. As soon as he'll be here, they'll flee away, dragging him behind them. The governor and I will be hidden behind the capes at the Gulf's entry. When the pirate will arrive close to my cannons, I'll... It's a great plan! Now, I'm sure we'll be in London soon. Let's go back inside before they notice we're missing. When do I see you again? You'll see me very soon. This time, he's gonna fell into the trap. No, I bet one guinea that Poof won't show up. Well done, boys! Anchors aweigh. The governor's gonna be surprised. Ship in sight! Its' making signals! Trap successful. New England intercepted Poof. Goodwin asks for support. ''Goodwin... asks... for support.'' He fall into the trap. Take in the sails! We're following the sloop. Full speed ahead. Send: "Roger. Following your way." Poof is done. Here they come. Full speed ahead. Goodwin will believe Poof is following us. It's time for revenge, Peter Goodwin. You agreed on a signal, right? I asked you a question! Answer. If things turn bad, you'll sink with us. If I'd succeeded to have Poof following me, I was supposed to shoot the cannon three times. before to pass over the cape. Gunners, take position. Nervous, captain? No. Not because of Poof. Listen, you're old. What would you think of a woman who stole a medallion from me and gave it back to me right away. I gave it to her again but, later, she threw it at my face. Now, I met her again. She kissed me and took me the medallion back. I think you're in love. And you should be careful, captain. Take your positions! Tiller to starboard ! Get ready! Here it is. The pirates must be behind. Ready to open fire! Aim the cannons at the governor's ship. Full sail and stay the course. The cannons are ready. Then, fire. Open fire on this ship, don't miss it. - Long live captain Poof! - Hurrah! Now, we're even, Peter Goodwin. Tiller to starboard, full speed ahead Goodwin! Let this rascal come in. The Academy made you a captain but forgot to teach you how to recognise a ship from another one. I cashier you! By virtue of the powers conferred to me. What do you have to say to shuffle off? Your ship was following the sloop who just did the right signals. Yes, I know... you were following it, not chasing it. But you must admit I couldn't clearly see it. Peter Goodwin, are you saying that all this is my fault? Do you know you killed three sailors and destroyed my ship? I should hang you for that. I'm not trying to justified myself, sir. I have no excuse for having open fire on you. I knew Poof was smart but I never imagined... Someone must had inform him about our plans. It's impossible. You and I were the only ones to know. Mary! Who's that Mary? Say, did you speak about it to someone? Yes, sir, I did. Now, it's a personal matter. I'll go to see captain Poof on my own. I'll bring you his head. If I succeed, you'll rehabilitate me. Otherwise... it's not a problem. It's a crazy thing to do, Goodwin. But I agree. You have one-in-a hundred chance to succeed. But if you do, I'll forget everything. Where can I find captain Poof? The San Salvador island is their hideout. No ship ever succeed to force the port. It's nothing more than a huge bazaar where the pirates squander their haul. I'll take you close to the island with the New England, but you'll be on your own. I'll cruise offshore the island until dawn. Some clothes and a good knife is everything I need. Very well, Goodwin. I hope to call you captain again. Good luck. Hey, you, do you want some? It's my treat, and there's plenty. Thanks, friend, but I have to see Poof first. Captain Poof... he's not the same he used to be. He doesn't come to see women as he used to do. You'll find him on his ship, over there. He doesn't come to see us anymore. He spend all his time on his ship. What's wrong, Mary ? Leave me alone. Mary, lvan is a good boy. Don't do it again. All the women need a man. Grandfather, that's my business. Excuse me, I'm a bit irritable. I know, you're like this since you've heard about Goodwin. Come on, forget everything about this story. You had your revenge, forget it now. Let's bravely criss-cross the seas again. Who knows what happened to him? Who? Peter. Peter Goodwin. A captain who sink the governor's ship can't be decorate. Don't worry. They can even... hang him. But they'll probably chop his head off. The fastest way to do. - A good blow and bang! - No! You still love him, do you? Good night, grandfather. Good night, Mary. I knew you betrayed me, but I didn't think I'll find you in his bed. Run away, if they'll find you, they'll kill you. I have to kill Poof first. I have two reasons to do it and it's useless to try to defend him. Listen to me carefully, then. Kill captain Poof to obtain the governor's pardon. Kill him to prove you're a man! Do it right now! I am Poof. You? Do you think I'm that dumb? I am captain Poof. You want to save your lover. I'll never kill a woman. Run away before they find you. I can't answer for my men. Don't say anything else. At least, keep a bit of decency. Or I'll forget you're a woman. Captain Poof ! Don't move! Captain... This man tried to kill you. Under our law, he deserves to die. Let's hang him! Take him! Captain Poof, if you really were a woman, you wouldn't enjoy this kind of show. I know you're killing me to take your revenge over the only man who made you feel what you really are. A woman like any other woman. Peter Goodwin, your place is in London's sitting-rooms. Come on. What are you waiting for? Give him a sword. He deserves the rope, not the sword. Who's in charge here? Give him a sword. Listen, Goodwin. Fight like if I was a man. The winner will decide what to do with the other. Bravo, Mary, come on! Come on, Mary ! And now, captain ? Don't move! I'm gonna keep my word. He defeated me. Peter Goodwin, my life is yours. Captain, you are my prisoner. - Follow me - You won't take anybody with you. You're already lucky we let you go. Take cover! Quickly! We can't fight them! Abandon the ship, go to the island! Get closer, quickly! - Goodwin! - There's nobody left! Keep going, we're out of reach now. I couldn't abandon you to your destiny. Chance has been with us. Thank you, sir. You saved my life. And this damned captain Poof ? Tell me. I can't wait to know if your mission was successful. Captain Poof? You know... He's dead. I killed him during a duel. This girl was his prisoner. You are a courageous man. This lovely creature should be a sufficient reward. But I give you back the command of the New England. You'll go yourself to London to tell about your exploits. This is the first time ever I taste water, but... Who is he? Mary... Mary ! Are you all right, count of Berry ? Those damned pirates wanted us dead. LONDON, SIX MONTHS LATER Again? I already told you three times. Tell us how you killed the terrible captain Poof. Was he seven feet high? Did he chop off the heads of his prisoners? Ask to this gentleman, he also knew Poof. Captain Poof ? He was a giant. His sword was too heavy for three normal persons. It didn't scare Peter when he fought him. A big blow and bang! He stroke him down. You are adorable. If all the women are like you in the colonies, I'll have to quickly leave the old England. Sorry, duke. I leave her to you regretfully. You're the happiest man in London. Your wife is wonderful. ''Wonderful''. I could become jealous of such an enthusiasm. Of course. If they keep on adulate you. I'll tell them who really is the terrible captain Poof. They won't believe you. For them, I'm the poor girl found chained in the hold. You're such a good story teller that everybody believe you, even yourself. Translation from French: Aquasantajoe For Cinemageddon. July 201
