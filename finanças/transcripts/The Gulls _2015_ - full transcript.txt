TELESTO Film Company LADYA Film Company Supported by the Ministry of Culture of the Russian Federation presents My husband was a fisherman, as well as my father. Men never said what was going on at sea. But we knew it was dangerous there. My husband told me: "Just wait and believe that I'll be back. Your faith keeps me going." I believed. I waited. He was always coming back. THE GULLS Go home! What have you been doing? Nothing. I visited your Mother. Gilyanka is getting married. Mother wants to take a loan. Who is the guy? Is she pregnant? No. Pour me a cup of tea. Make the staccato sharper. Mind your fingers. Do it once more and slower. Practice it, please. I'll be back in five minutes. Is Sanzhiev going to play at the concert, Elza Nikolaevna? He isn't ready at all. I mind. He has only one etude ready. What about the Bach polonaise? Yes. He played it a month ago at the exam. Sounded good. Think about it. Otherwise we only have folk instruments. We should add something else too. Inna Badmaevna was asking me. All right... If Inna Badmaevna's said so. Elza, could you lend me 100 rubles? Smoked? No. You'd better not. Mother won't take a loan. I've talked to Ledzhin. He'll lend his boat. We'll share the rent with Batyr. Oh, do what you want! Preventive measures and special operations are being carried out within the 'Fishing Season' Campaign to stop illegal fishing. The pursuit of poachers ended up with machine-gun fire and the death of one of the culprits. Helicopters and machine guns were used to stop the boats. At first, the poachers tried to elude pursuit, and the warning shots didn't bring them to their senses. Then the border patrol opened fire from a machine gun. The fishing season was closed on December 5th, but even bad weather can't stop the poachers. They continue to go out to sea through their secret channels. - Why? - Batyr and China are coming. We'll celebrate the deal. Is there any food at home? What about the weather? It is expected to get warmer next week. The ice will melt, we can go out. Did you plot the position? I did. What about the border patrol? Ledzhin pulled some strings. So we can do it. Hell, his wife's so cool. I came, she laid the table and went to her room. Take it. But whose is it? It was your car the police officers stopped, searched and found some narcotic substance of vegetable origin there. Ledzhin, stop denying it. We've been following you for half a year. - Your mobile is bugged. - Cut it! I kept on the rails. Really? Criminal code, Article 228, 4 to 8 years in prison. It's drug trafficking, Ledzhin. If you own it up, you'll get the minimum. Let me make a call, Captain. Hello! Have you seen Basan? I just needed to have a word with him. It's okay. Okay. All is well. - So? - Wait a second. Let's go. Look, let's have a deal. Okay, let's try. There is a word someone is going fishing? How do I know, all right? Okay, Article 228. Write it up. Our chief's complaining that we aren't working well. We need to finish the year on a high. The ice is bad, it'll cut the boat like a blade. Let's go. - What happened? - The sea freezes over. Okay, stop. Come on! Make your choice. Take the Edilbai. No way! I want the Merino. There's one, which is earmarked. Do you see him? - Catch him! - Me? You. Come on! Go! - This one, right? - Yes. Drive him to the right. Stop, I say! - Come on, pretty boy! - Get him here. Get up. Let's put him in the car. Take him by the head. His legs first. Go! It's okay. - As-salamu alaykum. - Wa alaykumu s-salam. Too many Dagestanis in the steppe now. Has he been here for a long time? Since last winter. How are you there, brother? Not bullied by Russians? Everything is fine. I miss home. May you always have tea and food in abundance. It's an important day today - of the formal marriage proposal. Two people have decided to start a family. Seeing their well-being and sharing their desire to marry, we as their parents and relatives are in great joy. Glad to become related with you! As the Kalmyks say let us always look openly at each other's eyes! Let our relationship be so strong that nothing and no one can break it and separate us! We need more water. Sanal, bring some more water. What? One mo. - Sanal? - In a jiffy. Hello! How are you? Fine. And you? Go on! I see. No. Look, stop, okay? We have a marriage proposal here. Okay, let's meet in an hour, near the shop. Sanal, are you nuts or what? Where are you going? - Hi! - Hi! - Have you arrived today? - Yesterday. - How are you? Speak up! - Fine. And you? Fine. I took several weeks off. I moved. Mega and I rented a two-room flat. He moved his family. It's okay. You remember him? That former classmate of Dzhiga, a fat one. - Danarka isn't working? - She works in a restaurant. Their son is here with his Grandma. Goes to the kindergarten. I see. Will you stay long here? Are you tired of me? No, I'm not. What did Ledzhin come for? On business, Mom. Maybe Ulan can help us with money? Only our bridal party is 300 people. Plus a bedroom suite. Mom, why Ulan? Thank Heaven that he doesn't ask for anything. There will be money, Mom. I had a bad dream. Have you ever had a good one? I saw Elza standing in a white dress. My heart aches for you. You should leave her. Stop this, Mom! Let's go. They've put out today. Here will be the nets. At map grid 99. Does he pay all the rent for the boat himself? Shares it with Batyr. He usually goes out only during the fishing season. But now he needs the money. I think they'll come back in about four days. They say it'll be cold afterwards. If the sea freezes, they'll get stuck. Elza? Elza. We need to talk. Don't you want to tell me anything? All right. How long? What do you mean how long? Five weeks, probably. I visited her and she said to take off the crown of spinsterhood. I'm a bit ill. You? Of course you go. There's no price-list as such. Give 50 rubles, it will be okay. - Now, wait. - Two loaves of bread, please. She lives downtown, where Bolzhik lives. Her name is Aunt Rosa. There is also a certain Saglara living in Rakusha. I saw her, too. Happy New Year! - Aunt Rosa receiving here? - Yes. Who is the last in the queue? Okay. It looks like not everybody will be received today. Some lined up as early as 4 am. Yes. She is a good fortuneteller. I won't consult you. Go home. Next one. Fishing Control Dzhiga. Dzhiga! - Hi! - Hi! Come on, call them! Hello, Ledzhin! It's Elza. Yes. Saga has come, Batyr's wife. Dzhiga said they would be back tonight. Okay. Bye. What? Go home. I'll call you in the evening. I see. Thank you. Ledzhin was here. Said if they don't get in touch today, there will be almost no chance. They won't be able to. Elza... I had a dream yesterday. A bad dream. Gulls were flying in circles over the sea. Gulls... are souls of perished fishermen. My husband used to say: "Just wait and believe I'll be back. Your faith keeps me going." I believed. I waited. He was always coming back. You don't believe. You are not waiting. You have no love for him, and that's why you have no children. You're empty. You should have gone long ago - just not to take someone else's place. Then my son would have come back. Leave us. Elza. Hi, Elza, why are you late? How are you? You didn't have to come. We understand. Go home. The main thing now is to be with the family. Hello, Inna Badmaevna. Are you all right? Elza? Lord, have mercy... Find him for me. We will, Mom. We will. Elza's all alone there. Want some tea? - Hi. - Hi. Happy New Year! Are you going to keep me standing here? Come in. - Tea? - Yes. Elza, don't think anything bad, all right? You know you can always count on me. If you need anything, just say so. Yes? Okay, coming. I got it, all right. Okay, be brief. I have to go to work now. Sure. - You want a lift? - No, thank you. I need to drop in to see Saga. Okay. Bye. Call me if you need anything, and no ceremonies. I saw an ad on Vkontakte last night. - They're raising money for Saga. - What Saga? The wife of Dzhiga's mate. Goodness, she's left all alone with three kids. Hi. Elza, we were talking here... Maybe we should raise money for you through Vkontakte, like for Saga. What money? Is Saga raising money? Not she, others are doing it for her. Opened a bank account. She's left with three kids. And why do I need money? Gee, I'm saying all the wrong things. Sorry. - Is Inna Badmaevna in? - Yes. She's resigning. Take your time. You can resign wherever you wish. There are courses starting in the city. You go there for a week and try to relax. Elza... It was clear from the beginning that nothing would work out with her. How about Elza staying with us, Mom? Why should she stay here? She's childless, what's the reason? She's expecting a baby. Oh, hello! How're you doing? Sorry. - Hi! - Hi! I've made an appointment for you for tomorrow, at 10 am. He's a good doctor. Put down the phone number. Okay. Thank you very much. I'll SMS it to you. If you want it, we can go together. Of course I do. - Is anybody with you? - I'm alone. - Let's sit together. - Okay. - I'll be back in a minute. - Okay. - Hello. - I'd like to deposit some money. - The account opened in our bank? - Yes. - Is it in your name? - No. I need the full name of the account holder and your passport. - Goryaeva Saglara Nikolaevna. - Thank you. - What's the amount of the deposit? - One hundred thousand. You must put down your own signature on the document. - Can I help you with anything else? - No. That's all. Let's go over to the cash desk. - Hi! - Hi! Having no nightmares yet, eh? They were unlucky, weren't they, Ledzhin? So long. Let's go. It's all right. Don't worry. I've found out everything. My husband got in touch with the right people from Lagan. There's something shady going on. It's better not to meddle in it. You see? There's no way of getting him back all the same. Why shady? I don't know. I really don't. I've got to go, okay? Thank you. You sure you want it? Won't be sorry later? Okay. Call me if need be. Has Elza called? No. Excuse me... Too late for termination. Could you turn it on? You called me?
