Our text today comes from the Gospel of Luke. Marcia, hurry before he sees us. I ain't trying to go to hell for trampling over Mrs. Methuselah. - Where y'all going? I wanna go. - No. You gonna get us caught. Y'all trying to sneak off to the movies again? Yep. And if Boris Kodjoe hops off that screen and into my lap, mm-mm... ...hell, here I come. - Ugh! It's hot in hell. But hotter in my lap. Okay? - Y'all is crazy. Angie. Damn, we're busted. I'll tell Boris you said hello. - Be back in time for evening service? - We're trying to go to the movies. The movies. Can the movies compare to salvation? Hm. Boris Kodjoe? It's a close one, Bishop. Asthma seems to be getting worse. How many inhalers do I have? Five, Daddy. Next to your bed, in your medicine cabinet... ...your top-desk drawer, glove compartment... ...and right here in my purse. Here you go. Oh, in the meantime, I found a new homeopathic cure. You boil your 10 cloves of garlic in milk and drink it. Just like her mother. She understood nobody looks after family like family. All we have is each other now. - Oh, come. You can see a movie anytime. - When? I have choir rehearsal, I have Bible band, Bible study... ...midweek services and usher board meetings. Daddy, I need a break. And you'll get one. - But-- - At the church retreat. Three days of prayer, relaxation and fellowship with God. That's who I need a break from. I meant-- Never mind. Marcia, would you mind helping Angie clear the pews? Oh, wouldn't miss that experience even for the rapture, Bishop. That boy love him some Angie. Look at him. Stalling again, just to spend time with you. You always seeing things that ain't there. - We just friends, girl. Mm-hm. What? Hey, hey, hey. That's-- That's mine. That's mine. "Daddy, Can I Come Back Home?" - What's this? - Gospel play coming to town Tuesday. You free, Angie? Huh, just friends, huh? Thanks, but we've got Bible study. Yeah. Bible study's cancelled this week. It's got that leaky ceiling. Well, I have to pass anyway. I heard about those Chittlin' plays. With titles like If You Dis Me, You Dis God. Yeah, yeah, but you know-- I mean-- At the end of the show, somebody's getting saved. - Yeah. - And the singing. They've got good singing in this one? Yeah. Like, better than me? I mean, ain't nobody better than you. - But... - You're just saying that. Look, I mean-- I know how you always wanted that big record deal. You know, I think that we should do a gospel demo-- - Who's in these plays? Famous actors? - Yeah. You know, remember Bookman? - Yeah. - Bookman from Good Times? - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. I saw him in one play... ...and then Dwayne from What's Happening? Hey, hey, hey. Hey. Hey, Mother Charles. Pastor's daughter out here congregating with men. Shameful. And feel free to lower your hem another half inch. It's crawling up your thigh. Why, when I was your age we wore our skirts... ...a quarter inch below the knee. - A quarter inch below the knee. - Stop making fun of me. - Now you the fast one. - I'm not trying to be fast. It's long. - Quarter-inch below the thighs. It's at my knees. Don't believe you. In the house of God. Go home. - See your Chittlin' Circuit play. - All right. Bible study got cancelled, thank God. I know. Wynton told me yesterday. I'm about sick of church anyway. What? Is that allowed? I mean, don't get me wrong. I love my father, my church, my life. I just know there's so much more out there, and I'm missing it all. I think I can fix that. Bust out that hot new dress you been hiding from Bishop. Angie, are you getting that? I'm in the bathroom. King residence. Hi, Bishop. You take care now. Bye-bye. Hey. Do you need anything else before I go to Bible study? - I'm fine. Marcia called. Says she wants-- - Okay. Pick her up tonight and bring her to work in the morning? No way. Now, what would Jesus do? Probably snap his fingers and get that little raggedy Hyundai of hers fixed. You just remember that you're the child of a King. Our last name is King, Daddy. So would it be easier to just spend the night at her house? I guess. But I know how much you need me around here, so... You... ...are remarkable. - See you in the morning, Daddy. - Bye-bye. I can't believe Bishop keeps falling for that trick. Girl, my father might be anointed, but he ain't got no street game. Okay. - Come on, now. - I know. We gonna be late. Girl, that bag is cute. It really completes the look. Girl. So let's do this, mama. You ready? It'd be nice to hear other than "Praise the Lord, Sista King." I know. I wanna hear some like "Hey, shawty let me tap that ass--" Watch your mouth. Girl, look. That's Shay-shay and them. Remember? From middle school. - Uh-uh. - Girl, she wearing that dress. Look at her. Church girls in the house. - Hey, mama. Girl, look at them chandeliers. This club is off the hook. Wow. So, what now? Now we gotta find us some ugly dudes who'll buy us some drinks. Oh, I see two over there by the bar. And one over there by the door. - We gonna get us some drinks tonight. - Oh, my God, girl. Look. Look, look. Is that--? Devlin Mitchell. Oh, girl, he had that hit record with Gia. Remember? Rub it on me Up against me Girl, that's my song! Oh, he's so fine. Come. Let's show him how Georgia women put it down. We can't get up there. - Got on our VIP dresses. We getting in. - They're gonna kick us out. Devlin! Devlin Mitchell. Hey, how you doing, Devlin? Me and my girl are big, big fans. - Could we have your autograph? Please? - Let them in. We're getting in! Thank you. Thank y'all so much. Thank you so much. Sign mine right here. Put something like "Marcia, rub it up against me. Again." Does your friend talk? - Say something, Angie. - What? What you girls doing later? I'm having a party back in my room. - Well-- Yeah, yeah. - We have choir rehearsal in the morning. Good girls.

Yeah. - Y'all come tomorrow night and hang out. - Yeah, for sure. For sure. All right? I'd follow him anywhere. All I know is you better not lose them damn tickets. Bishop, you need to get on the road or you won't make your engagement. I can't leave without Angie. She knows about my conference. She stayed at Marcia's last night. Haven't heard from her since. - Call Sister Watkins. - I did. Apparently, there is a play in town that they're excited about seeing. - A play? - Mm-hm. She needs a good grounding. Bishop. Bishop, I know this is none of my business... ...but that child is over 21. You're right, Emma. It's none of your business. Ooh!

And you can only imagine the souls that are being saved every night. Is that the only reason? I mean, it could be my big break now. You know how many big producers come through plays like this?

I learned long ago to cherish what can't be replaced. Come on, let's go. Oh, no, no, no. My father might smell my breath for alcohol. If it was wrong, then why would Jesus turn water into wine? My father says-- What does that mean? It means when are you going to start experiencing life for yourself? Don't you take another step. You may not have many more left. Hey, Mama, what you doing in my room? The play was over at 10. Then we stopped to eat. Until now? The only thing open this late is liquor stores... ...and legs. Where's Angie? Wait right there.

In my house, under my roof, where I pay the bills, I make rules. There's something I need to tell you, Daddy. I'm leaving. Leaving? I'm going on the road with a gospel play. It's just like church, Daddy. Singing, praising and preaching-- No, I forbid it. My whole life... ...I've lived for your blessing. To please you. Well, I'm grown now. And I don't need your permission. That's what you say. That's what you say. What does God say? I'm going, Daddy. I'm going. Did you hear me? You're not going anywhere! Get off me! I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. You walk out that door... ...never step foot in this house again. Don't call my phone. Don't even mention me to God. I'm sorry, Daddy... ...but I have to do this for me. I hope that you can understand one day. Goodbye, Daddy. You better go ahead. We're not stopping or going to the bathroom... ...all the way to Arkansas. - Whoa. You almost got left. You're late. - I need a schedule. Oh, and my contract? You're looking at your contract. We do seven shows a week, matin?es on Saturdays and Sundays. Monday is your travel day. Hurry up. I'll save you a seat. The contract ends when you piss me off. You understand? Now, you look like a good kid. What you do on your own time is between you and God. You understand?

I'm understudying the lead. Everybody here understudies. Even me and Biscuit, the bus driver. Oh, well, how often does Desiree miss a performance? Never. Neither sickness, nor death, nor baby-daddy drama... ...keeps us from getting out on that stage. Angie, we're here. Oh, come on, girl. We gotta unpack and get over to the theater.

Most of the men in the show spend a grip on dirty movies. Wait, I thought these were all Christian men. My bad. Let me rephrase that. Most Christian men in the show spend a grip on dirty movies. Oh. Downstage. I said downstage. Who told you to walk there? Downstage. Which way is that? Get your dumb country Bama behind off my stage. I need a new next-door neighbor.

Angie, would you ever say no to me? That's a dangerous question. But I think I trust you. No, I wouldn't. I've always wanted to do it in a tent. - Excuse me? - Church, I mean. I saw them setting up when we pulled in. Would you go with me? You're what every church girl wants. A bad boy who loves the Lord. Come on. Hey, baby girl. Where's my dinners? I'm sick of this.

Would it be a mistake to spend the night with me? No. I mean, yes. Yes. - You want me to keep it real? - Please. As freaky as you think PK's might be... ...I've never gone past foreplay.

T-shirts are 20, hats are 10 and programs are 5. Avoid negotiators, and wouldjatakers. Wouldja what? "Oh, excuse me, sister. I know it's $20, but would you take a 10 in Jesus' name?" - Why are you crazy? - Hell, no, is the answer. Hell, no. Angie? Hey, it's Monte. Monte from Macon. Your father used to preach at my father's church when we were kids. - Little Monte? - Hey. Oh, my goodness. How you doing? - What was that song we used to sing? Jesus made me strong That's it. - What are you doing here in Texas? - My wife. She's visiting her family. Well, I gotta meet her before you leave. She's taking my daughter to the bathroom. - You promise me? I gotta-- - Excuse me. - I wanna introduce you to my friend. - How you doing, bro? - We'll get to that. Need to talk to you. - Okay. Talk to you later. Hey, baby girl. Give me a kiss. Hey, baby. What's wrong? Don't you ever, as long as you're black, disrespect me like that. - Disrespect you how? - Okay. - Maybe this will jog your memory. - Ah! You think I don't see you? I see everything. Where's Angie? - Laying down. Let's hurry up. We're late. Oh, I'm so excited. I can't wait to see my girl. - She gonna be so-- She'll be happy? Well, why wouldn't she be? I don't know. I mean, people change sometimes. Oh, not Angie. Never her. You know she's never called me back, right? Not even once. Oh, Wynton, I'm sorry. You know, she probably just got busy, you know? They're rehearsing. You know them showbiz people. Oh, this place nice. Maybe she'll know. Excuse me, do you know where the box office--? Peaches, right? I'm Marcia. This is Wynton. Friends of Angie's. We drove up to see her perform tonight. She hasn't been on stage in weeks. Her vision is still blurred. What? What happened? Excuse me. I need to finish setting up the display table. - What she talking about? - I have no idea. Peaches, these are the only ones I could find. What are y'all doing here? You should have called first. We're your friends, Angie. We came to see you, girl. - Angie, what happened to your face? - Friends mind their own business. - Friends let me live my own life. - No, no, no, Angie. Friends care. Who--? What, did Devlin do this? It wasn't his fault. Angie, you can do a hell of a lot better than Devlin. With who? - You? - Okay. Oh, Angie. - What's happened to you, girl? - Marcia. Baby, just come home, all right? It ain't supposed to be like this. This is what I want. Hello? I done told you, woman. Quit calling my house. Now, you don't want me to have to get buck wild. - Bye. - Hey, excuse me. Can I talk to you for a minute? No, I'm busy. Here she calling again. What do you want, hussy? You don't talk to me that kind of way. Wait a minute. You gonna make me lose my-- What you say? Wha--? Ike, do something. Throw that man out! - Do it! Hey, there, security! Yo, fuck, man! - Fellas! Come on, man. No, my boy didn't paint your cat. My boy done stop drinking. I'm sorry, we'll buy you a cat. I hope you didn't do anything crazy. - Two wrongs don't make a right. - Yeah, but three lefts do. Look, if you two can't support me, then go back where you came from. Yeah, we're gonna do both. We're gonna support you and go home. Let's go. Hey, old friend. I just had a dream that woke me up. In my dream, God was whispering to you. He said that even when you leave him... ...he never leaves you. His light is greater than your darkness. And that once this test is over... ...he's gonna give you a marvelous testimony. - I can't find her inhaler. - Asthma attack. Ike, where are we? Ten miles of country road in front of us. She okay? - I think I can help. I need some honey. - Oh, my bag. I need a napkin. Here. I got one. Here. Back up a little bit. Give her some air, y'all. Breathe in through your nose, out through your mouth. What are you doing? I do this for my dad. When she inhales the air that makes contact with the honey... ...it eliminates the mucus. This should at least get us to the hospital. - Praise the Lord, Sister Emma. - Praise the Lord, Sis. - Did Bishop eat lunch today? - You know how stubborn that man is. We might have to feed him intravenously. My cobbler don't taste as good that way. Bishop, did you eat anything? I brought you some of my-- Are you okay, Bishop? I can never find what I need. Are you looking in the right places? This was Angie's responsibility. Angie's not the only one that can look after you. I'm all right. I'm all right. Girl, come on. I'm all right. I'm coming. Hold up. All right, y'all. Let's go, let's go. - Watch your hand. Angie. I can't believe what you did for me on the bus. I've had a lot of practice. Yeah, but I've never been nice to you. And if you hadn't been there... ...then I probably would've-- Thank you. You would've done the same for me. Don't you believe that. You really wanna do my role? If you're gonna be my understudy, you got a lot of work to do. You got blocking and cues. So you meet me in my room tomorrow afternoon. Is Devlin gonna be there? Girl, please. No, that's over with. I promise. Listen... Listen, I'm quitting the show pretty soon. Now, I can't really talk about it much right now... ...but you're good, Angie. This role was made for you. Daddy, can I please come back home Hold me closer, never let me go - Sing. Daddy, can I please come No, Angie. Come on, now. We been through this. No, no, no. That's-- Stop. You sing every song the same way every time. - I'm singing it just like you. - That's the problem. Now, our audience may not be the most sophisticated, but they are discerning. And they can spot a lie. How am I lying? By not relating. Every song should be different... ...because your character is experiencing something different at the show. - I know that. - Okay, well, then sing it. Tell me the story. - What story? - Angie, okay, now. What's the play about? A small-town girl, doesn't appreciate home... ...so she leaves, but then she regrets it. And by then, it's too late. Her father's dead, and she's in this world all by herself. Okay. Then play it. She's three different people. She's the girl that leaves home who's full of curiosity. She's the one in the world that's blinded by lust. And the girl who repents. There you go. All three of those girls would sing the same song... ...three different ways. - Wow. Can I try it again? - Come on. Daddy, can I please come back home - Yes, Angie. - Hold me closer, never let me go You better sing, girl. I know that's right. What? I'm just trying to figure out how I got so far off-track. I used to be on fire for the Lord. You gonna get all holy on me again? Can I at least let my food digest? This needs to stop. What needs to stop? Do you really need to ask? There really isn't any record deal, is there? You just made the whole thing up to keep me on your string. - So you think I'm lying to you? - Mm-hm. Devlin, Myke Jarett, Rub Rhythm Records. Looking forward to seeing you in New York. Don't forget to bring that lovely talent you discovered. Peace. Thank you for letting me hear that. I really-- I really needed to hear that. You know what? One day-- One day you gonna realize ain't no man got your back like me. I'm sorry. Baby, I'm sorry. I just-- Excuse me. - Can I sit there, please? - Yep. Come on in. Thank you. You gonna say "I told you so," aren't you? No, I'm not gonna say that at all. I mind my own business. You're a good guy, Ike. We both know you're not quite such a good judge of character. Hm? - It's really coming down-- Thank you. - Come on. - Thank you. It's coming down. - Oh, I can't thank you enough. - I hope it wasn't an imposition. - Well, it was. But I didn't mind. How do you know that Angie is coming home? Because I'm a man of faith. That robe that I wear every Sunday? I thought that might give it away. Bishop. Listen, I found a lovely robe. - Well, she's getting older so-- - Bishop, I got this. If you say so. And look what else I got. Oh, that's nice. It's nice, isn't it? That's nice. Dev? You in here? Luke 15 is the chapter of lost faith. The lost sheep. The lost corn. And the lost child. Remember, everybody, the bus leaves at 6 a. m. sharp. New York is about a 12-hour drive, so wear something comfortable. Hey, Litha. - I just wanna say I'm proud of you. - Don't try and be nice to me now. - Litha. - Got you. All right. Wynton? How you doing? You make us proud. You're not only representing our church... ...but our savior as well. Thanks for not making me feel too much pressure. Well, you can only do your best, son. Thank you. Well, Wynton. I miss my daughter. I feel I may have held the reigns a little too tightly. Everybody needs the freedom to make their own mistakes. Learn on their own. I understand, Bishop. I understand. Six a. m. sharp. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, Peaches. - What is it? - New York. Is it still there? Yes. Cool. Make sure no one takes it. When I was a little girl... ...I would daydream this imaginary tour. We start off at Carnegie Hall... ...then the Met... ...and then the Garden. Even Broadway. But I saved the best for last: The Apollo. And just before I ended my song... ...Chaka or Aretha or someone awesome like that... ...would come in from outside... ...and join me in a duet. Peaches? What do you dream about? Peaches? I dream, Angie. One day people will notice the size of my talent... ...rather than the size of the man. New York is that kind of place. Let's go, folks, let's go. Let's go. Let's go. I got 36 hours to take this stuff back. I don't have all day. Let's go. Let's go. My man. Listen. I need those wires connected and everything working. Okay? I had a problem last time. - Where are my leads? - On their way, here in an hour. Got sound check in a hour. Everybody ready in 45 minutes. - Where are my leads? - We're ready. Don't, "We're ready, Ike," me. Where's Devlin? He had a big meeting with some record people. - With who? - A record label. You tell the record company to give him his paycheck. Tell them I said that. Oh, yeah. You playing two roles tonight. You're playing Cookie and Grandma. I need you out there at intermission selling programs. Help her out with that. I'm sick of this. - Okay, give me a sec. Ike. Ike! Ike. - What? - Look, my contract's almost up. You know Angie's your girl. She got my role down. I mean, she's good but nobody know her. I need somebody there that can sell tickets. I got one of the En Vogue girls coming to the show tonight. And if she likes it, she's gonna take over next month. You know how the game go. What's the point of being an understudy? - Angie, chill. - I've been understudying for months. Angie, not right now, okay? It's bad timing. You got a beef with me, young lady? What if I do? You ain't God. You keep talking, find your way home, all right? Give her a break, all right? She's going through some things. Yeah, she gonna be going through airport security if she keep talking. In fact, get her a bus ticket. Let her catch the bus home. This whole thing is a joke. So unprofessional. Unprofessional? Everybody stop. Everybody stop. Stop. Did you hear what she just said? This whole thing is unprofessional. Let me tell you what unprofessional is. You acting like a little hoochie. Jumping in and out of bed with Devlin before you knew him. Unprofessional is having your boyfriends fighting backstage. That's unprofessional. In fact, unprofessional is the way you just talked to me. You better be glad I like you, little girl. You know what? I don't like you that damn much. You're fired. Anybody else got a problem with how I run my show? Pick up your paycheck and go home. Hey, let him cool down, okay? You're gonna get your chance, Angie, but you gotta be patient. When I get my record deal... ...he's gonna regret who he fired. All right, let's get back to work. I got money to make, and I got a show to do. And let's keep it professional. Hey, here they are. Devlin, my main man. Boy, it's been some long, long years. Man, you are looking good, boy. This is a nice place, man. Glad to see you finally spending some money. Well, you know, hey, nothing but the best. This is Theodore Bell, our executive vice president. How you doing, sir? Wow, the Theodore Bell. If nothing comes out, worth it just meeting you. Well, I'm flattered. Message one. Devlin, MJ. We're at the Marriott Marquis. See you at the restaurant in an hour. Top floor. Hey, bring that girl with you. She better be all that. My man Myke was telling me... ...about how you guys are trying to resurrect the whole romantic duo. Like Peaches and Herb. Tammi and Marvin. - Dev. - No, I'm cool with it. I'm willing to put my solo career on hold to make it all happen. Is he serious? That's not what I said. I said I would pitch the idea to Mr. Bell. But it was a long shot. - Well, that's not the way-- - Devlin. Devlin. Let me be clear so there's no more confusion. We're not looking for male vocalists, and certainly not one with baggage. - Man, you don't even know me. - All right, let's put our cards on the table. Nobody, nobody, no record company wants you. You got a bad rep. You got bad sales. What, public intoxication? What, domestic violence? Extramarital affairs. Your loss. Let's go, Des. We up out of here. We want her. Not you. We want a female artist who can cross over. But as long as she's signed to us, you get a managerial fee. Are you crazy? You think I came all the way up here... ...to give you my artist? We can get a deal anywhere. Fine. Well, back to the Chittlin' Circuit. You look for us on the charts, player. Let's go, Des. Let's go, baby. Hey. Let's go, Des. I'll take the managerial fee. This contract is a preliminary one. Hey. Sorry, baby, I'm late. Did you try and call me? The reception at the hotel is terrible. But I got the message off the voicemail. So I'm here. Hi. - Who is this? - I'm Angie. I'm the singer that Devlin was telling you about. There must be some mistake. Hi, Des, What are you doing here? Angie, I am so sorry. I had no idea. - What is this? Sweetie. I'm the one they came to meet. Angie, go home. You don't belong here. You never did. From the time I was a little girl... ...my father always told me how much he loved me. How beautiful I was. And because he said I was... ...I was. Because my daddy never lied to me. But then I met you. And for the first time in my life... ...I felt like nothing. But the Devlin is a liar. And now I know... ...that I am not what you say I am. But I'm what my father says I am. The child of a King. I'm sorry to disturb your meeting. Congratulations, Des. And congratulations to you too. Damn groupies. You ain't nothing. I'll choose my own manager, if you don't mind. Here you go. Here you go, ma'am. Can you check this out, please? - Here. - Thank you. Go check out the Gospelfest at the Apollo, all right? WO Gotta go. Taxi! Taxi! How do I get to the Apollo Theater? - Get in. I'll get you there. - Okay. Final sound checks. Testing. Check one.

Girl, I have been looking all over for you. - Come to the theater with me. - What's wrong? Desiree can't go on. You're the only person who knows her role. Why? Is she sick? - Just come on. Hurry. - Okay. Are you forgetting that I got fired today? Is Ike okay with this? - What the hell are you doing here? - Ike, I had no-- - You need to get into makeup, now. - We're going! Right now! Ike sent me to find you. Wait. I can't work with Devlin. - I can't even look him in the face. - You won't have to. - He told Ike it was either him or you. - And? - And what? Do you see him here? - Well, who took his place? Say hello to your new leading man. I love it. But wait, wait. I gotta check on Des first. Desiree is fine. She refused to go on because she said it was your time. She did that for me? Is it your time, Angie?

My cousin gets her hair done by Babyface's aunt... ...and I know she could get it to him. I've never said this to any woman in my life. I love you. Devlin. Angie. Angie. Angie! Hey, where to?

That's Angie. That's Angie. Angie, Angie, Angie. In the story we are told that when the child returned home... ...the father gave him a ring of gold and draped him in a fine robe.

I mean, hey, we're doing okay. A number one gospel CD, can't knock that. Okay, girl. And speaking of knocked, the next time you think you are... ...you might wanna ask somebody, rather than messing up that test. When I do eventually get pregnant. Her husband will rejoice. God did say he would give you a testimony. No, he said... ...a marvelous testimony. Come on, y'all. Let's do this. The movie starts soon. I can't wait to see my baby daddy, Allen Payne. They had a feast. Yeah. Some of you all might call it a cookout. That which was lost is now found. My child is home. God! He is good! Yes, he is!
