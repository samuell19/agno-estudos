It's his brother. [heavy breathing] [pensive music playing] [BOOTS HITTING PAVEMENT IN UNISON] [cars passing] [gentle kissing sounds] [woman moaning faintly] You will be the death of me, Nishka. Put me in your memoirs. "Two weeks with Nina Romanova were the most erotic I ever spent." Hm. The Russian Navy does not give out endorsements. [phone ringing] Hello. [speaking russian] For Commander Gregori. [grunting in frustration] This is Gregori. Da. Thank you, lieutenant. [phone nestling into cradle] We ship out day after tomorrow to rendezvous with the American Sixth Fleet. [kissing] You are a genius. They escort you. All the way to Syria-- and my money. It's not enough, you know. I want more money, double it. We had an agreement, Commander. [SHARPLY] Tell them, more money. They have no choice. I'm the only link you have with Odessa. Of course. We wouldn't want you to think we didn't value your help. Just make sure that you deliver Odessa and Hailstorm. [faint string music playing] I am a capitalist at heart, Nina. I wouldn't dream of letting you down. Double it. Don't forget. [kissing] I won't forget, Commander Gregori. [STIRRING ORCHESTRAL BRASS MUSIC PLAYING] [beeping] WOMAN: [ON INTERCOM] He's here. [phone ringing] Send him in. At ease, Jake. Sir. [chuckling] [hands slapping together] COMMANDER LARKIN: It's good to see you. Good to see you, sir. This is Captain Blake of Naval Intelligence. Captain Blake, Captain Jake Fuller, Navy Medical Corps. A long way from Virginia, aye, Captain? You, too. Seal Group 4, wasn't it? Yeah, a long time ago. Jake, Captain Blake has a very interesting proposal for you. The Sixth Fleet battle is hooking up with one of Russia's newest attack submarines for a joint training exercise in the Eastern Med. We're sending you aboard that sub as part of a crew exchange. You'll run their medics through a training course on Navy combat medicine. Why me, sir? I mean, I'm sure there's plenty of other officers available for this assignment. I'm supposed to be heading back to the States. Jake, you speak Russian fluently. Yes, I understand that, sir. And Captain Blake felt, with your background and intelligence-- --you might be a useful observer. Well, to tell you the truth, sir, I'm just a medic these days. I'm not really interested in this. [chuckling] This is a cakewalk, Jake. Just keep your eye on things. [TENSE ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PLAYING FAINTLY] Jake-- you know, there could be a promotion in it. [door closing] [pensive music playing] [wheels on wet pavement] [door closing] [speaking russian] [speaking russian] [HIGH HEELED SHOES CLICKING ON PAVEMENT] [gentle flute theme playing] [door opening] [door closing] Why don't I make you some tea instead?

MAN: Da. Show these to Commander Gregori on the Odessa, slip 18H. He's expecting you. [papers rustling] And get these bodies into storage. [footsteps departing] Ambassador Silver, I would be the first to know if any of our nuclear arms are missing. After all, we're not talking about children's toys. I mean no disrespect, Minister, but our intelligence sources are reporting an increasing number of Russian high-tech weapons surfacing in a number of third world countries very unfriendly to the West. [chuckling menacingly] An internal matter, sir. We have not yet uncovered any information concerning the United States. But if we do-- I don't think I'm making myself clear, Minister. Those missing weapons are being aimed at the United States, and that concerns us very much. If they fire, we'll respond in kind, and we'll start at the source. NISHKA: With all due respect, Minister, it would only be to our best interest to work together. Would it not, Ambassador? This situation, if true, troubles me as well. We will look into it further. Perhaps your office would care to assist? [sighing in relief] We'd be happy to provide any assistance. [seagulls crying faintly] [CRATES BANGING AGAINST ONE ANOTHER] Your replacements have arrived, Commander. And the bodies of my crew? They have moved to a cooler climate. [GLOOMY ORCHESTRAL THEME PLAYING] [music intensifies] [TRIUMPHANT MUSICAL THEME PLAYING] MAN: Odessa left port, sir. [paper rustling] Thanks, Dan. [beeping] Captain Jake Fuller. You ever heard of him? Unh-unh. What's a conscientious objector mean to you, Dan? It means a coward to me. [paper rustling] [uplifting theme playing] Slavin says 10 minutes. Eyes front, Kurganov. [mechanical whirring] The last of them. You are breaking a sweat, Slavin. It's not like you. I like fresh air. You better hold your breath. Dimitri. Lieutenant Kurganov. Yes, Captain. Take the conn. Maintain our present course. [footsteps departing] Maintain our present course. [mechanical whirring] Nikita. Three minutes. Petrov's on his way down. Pass these out. And Daninski, breathe deeply. Everything is working perfectly. [heavy breathing] [gasping] [non-english speech] [gasping] [coughing] You. Check the missile bay. You men, spread out. Check for survivors. Kill anyone you find. Go. Now. [non-english]. Dammit! [shouting] [gunshot] [gunshot] Nikita! [coughing] Breathe. Breathe, damn you! Help me. Why? Nikita is critical to this mission. You have already done your part. A little gift from Nina Romanova. [laughter] Blow the bodies through the airlock. And get Nikita some medical treatment. We've got to save him. Admiral Harrison? Captain Jack Fuller, reporting as ordered. At east, captain. Here, take a look at this. The Odessa? We think so. It's Morse code. Russian Navy emergency distress signal. Medical emergency? We don't know. Transmissions stopped a few minutes later. Could be their engines are malfunctioning. Hell, it could even be a mutiny. A mutiny? Well, with all due respect, sir, this isn't a medical emergency, and-- Captain. I've read your file. Are you looking for an excuse to get out of harm's way? No, sir. I'm just a medical officer. I don't repair Russian submarines. Just people. Mister, you are out of order. Sir-- As soon as we get to the Odessa, I'm going to make arrangements to get you and your nurse on board. Nurse? Ensign Swain reporting for duty, sir. Ensign, take Captain Fuller down of the galley and get some coffee. He's going to have a long night. Sir. Captain? Dismissed. Sir! 190. 200. 0 bubble. All ahead, full. Captain, the Americans are asking if we need medical aid. If they should send their visitor early? Visitor? Something about a Navy doctor and his nurse. Part of the training exercise. Damn! We were only supposed to travel with the Americans under escort, not take them aboard. Too bad Captain Gregori did not inform us of this. Too bad he's already dead. If we don't respond, the Americans will assume something is wrong. How is Lt. Nikita? Very ill. Without a medic aboard, he may not last a night. He can't die, Slavin. You know this. Not until Hailstorm is operational. Hailstorm? Captain, it may be possible that the Americans can save Lt. Nikita. That would be very ironic, Slavin. Signal our current position to the Americans. Tell them we had a-- chemical accident. A crew member is suffering from chemical gas inhalation. Request our visitors arrive as quickly as possible. Aye, captain. Do you insist upon staying up all night? I can't sleep. I'm sorry. What is it, darling? There's a problem at the ministry. Only Schikov won't admit it. Do you think he's lying? I think he knows more than he's telling. Well, you know you were walking into a nest of vipers when you took this post. I had such high hopes for this country. The emergence of capitalism. A chance for America to help a new Russia emerge from the ashes of the old. I know. I helped you write the speech, remember? Am I preaching again? Just a little bit, darling. But that's why I fell in love with you at Princeton. You were always so passionate. For an ROTC boy. And you were the most beautiful student I ever saw. Watch it, ambassador. You told me you fell in love with me for my mind. After I rewrote your wretched term paper. Oh, that, too. Yeah. You always did come up with my best lines. Well, somebody had to. They didn't teach you much political theory in the army. Now, will you please come to bed? Don't worry! Just do as I do! Contact the battle group. Tell them to hold at a quarter speed. We're not going anywhere until we hear from Fuller. Aye, sir. We've surfaced, captain. The Americans are ready to make the drop. Good. PILOT: Target spotted. And don't forget to jump! Bag! PILOT: Cargo dropped. Returning to base. [speaking russian] How come those sailors are wearing sidearms? Yes? It's coming through now. Thank you. What's going on? Newswire service. An explosion at a meat packing plant in Dubrovnik. It's all over the networks. Sounds like a slow news day. It's still a war zone. Probably Bosnian rebels. They found the bodies of 15 Russian sailors inside that plant. And every one of them had been assigned to the Odessa. The Odessa? Yeah. Oh my god. NEWSCASTER: In today's news, US police found the bodies of two Naval officers killed somewhere outside a Naval shipyard in southern coastal waters. The officers were shot twice, and then dragged through an abandoned warehouse and left inside a meat locker. It took inspectors 6 and 1/2 hours to search the area and recover the bodies of the officers. Both officers were assigned duty on the elite Russian submarine, the Odessa, which disappeared days ago near Syrian waters. The reason for the sub's theft, as well as the party behind it, are yet unknown. The police have not divulged the exact whereabouts of the site for reasons of national security. The United States team and the UN have been working closely to solve this problem. They hope to have more answers within the next few days. I gave him an agent to counteract the poison in his system. This adrenaline shot will have him up and moving around in a few hours. But he'll still be very weak. Can he do his duties? Well, he'll be a bit nauseous for the next couple of days, as his body expels the poisons. Right now, all he needs is rest. I'm amazed you were able to find a counter-agent so quickly. Well, we saw the same symptoms in the Gulf War. Would you care to see your humble bridge, Captain? Well, I do need to get in contact with Sixth Fleet. Ensign? I'll stay here and keep an eye on our patient. Could you help me for a moment? Sure. Just let the men know outside when you are ready. What the hell was he poisoned with? Dresden 9. Nerve gas. It was developed by the Nazis in World War II. Used b the Iraqis in the Gulf War. What's it doing on a Russian sub? That's a good question. You should ask him. I'm gonna get going. It's from Fuller. Patient healthy. Russian crew proceeding with exercise. No damage to the boat. Tell my brother I'm worried about the food. His brother? Dismissed. [beeping] The Americans acknowledged the message. We will continue along present course. Thank you. So now you see how the other half lives, eh? Well, I'll tell you one thing-- this is an amazing submarine. It's very clean. But the crew complement-- I don't know. It just seems very small. Most of Odessa's functions are fully automated. No need for a large group. Not even a medical officer? Unfortunately, Lt. Nikita-- he is our medical officer. Well, I guess you guys are happy to see me, huh? Ah. Would you please join us for some wine, Captain? Our way of saying thank you for saving our comrade. Well-- allow me. Ah, eureka. Good year, too, huh? I used to make a good living being a waiter. Oh, yes. Look at that. Help me, uh, put myself through college. Yes. OK. To the Russian bear. Hurrah! Hurrah. Yes. Hurrah. There we are. Little bit. You know, there's a lot of nice things I'm hearing about the Russians. Is it all true? What do you think, huh? [non-english speech] Perhaps not so good a year as we thought. Very good, Bulganin. Lock him in the crew quarters with the woman. And move Nikita into my cabin. I say we kill him. And the girl, too. Lt. Nikita still needs medical attention. I need them alive until he recovers. Try and relax, gentlemen. The Syrians are paying us a great deal of money for this beautiful submarine. I want to make sure we're all alive to enjoy it. What if they don't pay? Our fingers are on the trigger of the most powerful weapon known to man. They wouldn't dare refuse us. Our guests have bought us some, but-- They've bought us 24 hours. By that time, it won't matter anymore. We're very close to Syrian waters. We'll have the most powerful navy in the world as our chaperones. At ease. Having a bit of a problem with Odessa. Counter-intel is asking if Odessa's under the control of terrorists. That's quite a question. Do they have any evidence? Just some dead Russian sailors found in a meat packing plant in Croatia, and a dispatch from Fuller. But a message for his brother. A message? His brother's dead. It's all in there. You can read it in the chopper. I want you on the Jefferson ASAP. If this is true, our only hope may be a Navy doctor who refuses to pick up a gun. God help us all. Permission to speak freely, sir? - Always. - I've read Fuller's file. I'm sure he's trying to get a message to us. If the Odessa has been taken, God help the hijackers. Captain Fuller? Captain Fuller? Wake up! Captain Fuller, wake up! Sir? Wake up, sir! God! Sorry, sir. I couldn't wake you up. God. What time is it? Noon. Straight up, sir. Orders, sir? Orders? Perhaps, sir, we should find out who the hell's got this submarine, find out what they're doing with it, and try to stop them, sir. No. Find the ship's stores? No. Steal some weapons? No. Find me some aspirin. - Right, sir. Have a drink, Mr. Ambassador. My father once told me never to drink with politicians. He said they'll lie about what they had for breakfast if it suits them. Well, it seems you, yourself, are a politician, Mr. Silver. My country is extremely upset over a situation that seems to be getting out of control. I'd hate to think the presence of your submarine and our Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean would be enough to trigger-- let us say-- an incident that both our nations would regret. Very well, ambassador. The truth? We have been unable to contact Odessa since yesterday. The situation is becoming-- dangerous. How dangerous, minister? There is cargo aboard. What cargo? Hailstorm? Do we have any weapons, sir? Weapons? Any ideas? Not unless you have a bottle of wine handy. Hold that. [crashing] [crashing] OK, wait. OK, I know. I'm tired, too. Let's just do it one more time, OK? One more. OK. [crashing] Scream. [screaming] Scream again. [screaming] [shouting] [screaming] Hold him still! I'm trying! Come on, let's go. Let's move him. Hurry. Have we heard from Kradisky? No. Take some men and check on the prisoners. If Kradisky has been drinking, kill him. He needs to take his station. Aye, sir. This way? OK. Stay here. Check the other corridors. All the rooms. See if you can find Kadisk. [non-english speech] Shit. Go. All right. Slavin to bridge. Petrov. Kradisky's dead, and the prisoners have escaped. What? Find the Americans. We need them alive. Aye, captain. Jeez, you go so fast. Sorry. It's OK. It's OK. Where the hell are we going, anyways? We're in the access tunnels. I want to get to the missile bay. Missile bay? What the hell for? Figure that's the last place they'll look for us. OK. Go. Just in time, captain. I'm about to send a little hunting party after the Odessa. Before you do, Admiral, please read this. My rank won't impress you, sir, but the signature at the bottom might. It does. All right, Captain. I'll give your people 12 hours. No more. And then that sub goes down. Captain? Are you ready? I think so. I assume you have a key? How long will it take to enter the target coordinates? First I have to blow up the missile defense system in each city. Six cities, six hours. Maybe more. Excuse me? Captain? We are bluffing, aren't we? Of course, Daninski. Just like the American game of poker. We are raising the stakes. For a conscientious objector, you sure have a talent for killing. Wait. Sorry, sir. I read your file. How the hell did you get a hold of that? The metal's getting hot. We must be near the missile bay. Come on. You are a coward, Daninski? I have served with you for a long time, captain. This mission was to be about money. Nothing else. Nothing else. Take your station. Check the missile bay. I'm going to weapon storage. Da. Oh my god. It is true. Jeez. How the hell would they fire that? Hydraulics. The platform rises, inserting the nose cone into the launch tube. Codename Hailstorm. That nose cone contains six cluster warheads, each of which can separate targets. Can't it be disabled? We'll find out. According to intelligence reports, the Russians made it operational before completing a series of safety tests. The warheads are unstable. If the submarine is attacked, or if the missile is detonated prematurely, this entire ocean goes up in a mushroom cloud. It's remoted from the bridge. We can't do anything from here. Great. So we take the bridge. Let's go. Wait a minute. You learned all this stuff in nurse's training, Ensign? Lieutenant Swain, sir. Navy intelligence. I've been tracking this little toy for months. Your job was to get me on board Odessa. Well-- So I guess I did my job, huh? Hey! [gunfire] Captain's, someone tapping on the ship. From the inside. Gunfire? [gunfire] Come on, get out! Get out of there! [gunfire] Move! [gunfire] Shit! [groaning] Take her to the bridge. I'll get him. [shouting] [shouting] [shouting] [gunshot] It ain't my day. It ain't my day. WOMAN: Can you be certain? MAN: If Hailstorm is aboard that sub-- WOMAN: Well, have you heard from the president? He's in the middle of a treaty negotiation with China. I can't get through. I'll try him again in an hour. You know something? Weapons change, but the world just can't stop playing cowboys and Indians, can they? Diplomacy was a lot simpler in those days, wasn't it, darling? So was war. [music playing] MAN: Status is ready. Status ready. Captain Donner? The order's reading intercept and engage. That means war. It means war if we don't. Submerge the ship. Submerge the ship! Aye, aye. 20 degrees down bubble. [groaning] [gasping] So nice to see you again. [non-english]. You speak our language beautifully, Ensign. But your choice of words is not very lady-like. Now, where is your captain? Ensign Courtney Swain, United States Navy. Serial number 5-- [gasping] We've got to give them a few more hours! It's too late. We've got a submarine moving to intercept, even as we speak. Slavin? Find Fuller. Kill him this time. He doesn't have any place to go. Wanna bet? American. Oh! Shit! Well, man? [shouting] [shouting] [russian] I'm going to break your back. OK, come on. [screaming] There you go. You'll find this a very small little ocean when the Navy catches up with you. My dear, if you were sent after the Hailstorm missile, then you know the warheads are quite unstable. I can't possibly imagine even the United States Navy would be so callous as to endanger the entire eastern Mediterranean. I really don't expect a direct attack. Unfortunately for them, you and your partner were their last, best hope. I doubt anyone in the Sixth Fleet knows of Hailstorm's existence. And by now they'll know Odessa's been hijacked. To them you're just a target. It doesn't matter. Within a few hours, Hailstorm's warheads will rain down on select Russian cities. Separatists from Kazakhstan to the Ukraine will be blamed the Russian government will be forced to reclaim those nations. A new Soviet Union will rise from the nuclear ash. The relations in the west will deteriorate. Call it nostalgia, but I do miss the Cold War. And the rest of your crew? They will die for me, if necessary. I've kind of been noticing that. [snap] Slavin to bridge. He's killed Dmitri. You can't find one man? Captain, American submarine, dead ahead. Los Angeles class. Slavin, get up here. It seems the American Navy wants to play. Aye, Captain. Keep looking. Contact! Dead ahead, sir. Russian. Akula class. Speed? 20 knots. Odessa. OK. Let's give them a wide berth. Circle below, then around. We'll take them from behind. Aye, Captain. [grunting] Increase speed, Captain? No. Captain, the American is closing in. A very small ocean, captain. Black rubes one and two. Black tubes one and two. Assign preset. Firing solution locked into computer. Fire one. Fire one. One away. - Fire two. - Fire two. Two away. He's fired two torpedoes. Impact in 30 seconds. Captain? If we threaten to launch the missile-- Need I remind you, lieutenant, there is no way to communicate directly with the Americans. Captain, that's a Los Angeles class attack sub. He can outmaneuver you. Surrender before it's too late. I think not. 20 seconds to impact. Release countermeasures. Not yet. What is he doing? Making the bastard think he got us. Both hit straight and true. 10 seconds to impact, Captain. Captain? I've done this before, Daninski. Release countermeasures. Impact in five. Four. Three. [non-english speech] Now. [beeping] We got him, sir. Too soon to tell. A lot of underwater debris, sir. There. I'm picking up-- screws, sir. Very well. Slow to 15 knots. Flood tubes three and four. Yes, sir. Flood tubes three and four. Aye aye, sir. We'll get the Russkies this time. Sir, Springfield preparing for a second attack. Sir, please call off the attack. You know the risks when Hailstorm's warheads are prematurely detonated. You'll have a massive nuclear catastrophe on your hands. I've got Russia's latest nuclear sub on my hands. Probably under the control of terrorists. The United States Navy is going to take that sub out, and those are the orders of the day. With all due respect, Admiral, need I remind you of the signature on that letter? I'll relay your concerns to Central Command, and we'll wait for their reply. And that's all I'm going to promise you. Thank you, sir. Signal Springfield and tell him to break off the attack. Damn. He's locked onto us. Why doesn't he fire? Blow ballast. Surface. Surface the ship. Aye aye, sir. The American is surfacing. A mistake. Flood tubes five and six. Tubes flooded, Captain. Petrov, he's breaking off the attack. Why fire? Speed of ascent? 2 feet per second. Nikita, prorate target coordinates. Allow for 23% increase in ascent speed. - Locked. - Fire five and six. No! He's fired two fish. Release countermeasures. 10 seconds. [non-english speech] They slipped through. [non-english speech] Jesus, God. [shouting] Impact! Large underwater explosion. Odessa? Russian screws. We just lost 100 American lives, Captain. [gunshot] [gunshot] Brzezinski? Fuller. 12 kilometers to Syrian waters. Excellent. But there was something else I needed to do. Ah, yes. Swain. Please, forgive me, my dear. But-- [gunfire] Captain Fuller, I trust you can hear me? I just shot your partner. She's not dead, but she is bleeding rather profusely. If you would like the opportunity to save her life, I suggest you join us here on the bridge. Black tie. Thank you very much. No answer? The State Department did, and the president can't be disturbed. [gunshot] [screaming] [gunshot] Drop the gun, lady! You OK, ambassador? [shouting] Schikov sent you to clean up his dirty mess. That drunken fool? I take special care of him. He stays quiet. So will you. I'm afraid you were getting too close to the truth. Odessa? And her cargo. Nuclear fire to heat up a new Cold War. Say goodbye to your new world order. [click] [gunshot] - Oh, Zachary. - I'm OK. - Are you OK? - I'm OK. Yes. - I'll get you some help. Yeah. [groan] She's going into shock, Captain. Fuller? Your ensign is failing. And none of us poor sailors have any medical experience. Dananski, how far to Syrian waters? 23 minutes at the present speed. Fuller, you're the only one who can save her. I can't believe you're just going to let her die up here. What is it? Are you a coward? Fuller, I am waiting. [groaning] OK then, give me the missile key. Don't, Captain. I did not agree to join you to fire on our own people. Daninski, give me the gun. Is this what you want? Huh? Slavin! Is this what we came for? I have family in those cities. We all do! [gunshot] [shouting] [gunfire] Listen, we move. Now! [gunfire] [alarm] [gunfire] Ah! Shit. You OK? Shit. Swain! Swain! Shit. [alarm] Move. We can fire from the missile bay. I can't do this, Captain. Of course you can. It's from Central Command. By all means, sir. We have no choice. Thank you for waiting as long as you did. And I'm-- I'm sorry for the men you lost. It doesn't help much. Send to all ships. Evacuate to latitude 34, longitude 34. Jefferson will commence air strike in 30 minutes. OK. Move. Move! How long And no lies. 10 minutes. I've already sent the launch data to this computer. I just have to reprogram the launch controls. How do we escape? Don't worry, Nikita. We have a boat standing by. The Syrians will be picking us up. [alarm] Nikita? I have to cross-check the target controls. No games. But we are firing blind if I don't. Do it quickly! [alarm] OK. That's about all I can do for now. I'll be all right. We gotta get to Hailstorm. They can launch from the missile bay. No. Wait a minute. Being your doctor, I'm prescribing this. What is that? It's vodka. Take a swig. Done. All we need to do now is set the timer. Excellent, Nikita. You will be remembered as a hero of the new Soviet Union. [gunshot] [beeping] OK. Now we can go to the missile bay. Come here. Hurry. [alarm] Get outta here! [beeping] [shouting] [shouting] Help me. Go to hell! Hey! Hey! Help! Don't leave! Don't leave me! Come back! Don't leave me! [screaming] I can stop the missile. Help me to the controls. Please. We'll all be dead if you don't. Hell, I'll be dead, anyways. So it's your choice. Oh, god! Hurry up! Hurry up! Come on! You did it! You did it. Whoa! Jeez. I thought I told you to go to the bridge. I took a detour and shut down Hailstorm. Right. Let's get the hell out of here. You ready to go? Let's get out of here. Come on. All ships, report new positions within safety zones. Sub hunters are moving into position. Have them lock on target. Aye, sir. He's surface. Surfaced? There. Come on. Picking up a signal from Odessa, sir. Signal's garbled. In Russian. Admiral, please! I'm sorry. Watch out! [shouting] All planes, fire in 60 seconds from my mark. Fuller may have control. They might be ready to launch Hailstorm. 60 seconds from mark. SOS! - All ships, stand by to fire. - SOS! Launch commencing in-- Sir, incoming message from the strike force on Odessa. Do not fire! FEMALE VOICE: Seven. It's Swain and Fuller. I repeat-- They may have control. SWAIN: Do not fire. Belay the order! All aircraft, stand down. Oh, thank God. [shouting] [shouting] [shouting] Ambassador, I would like to express my apologies for the unfortunate turn of events here at the ministry. It could have been much worse, minister. Perhaps we can get together next week and clean up this mess? You may meet with my successor. I'm afraid I won't be available. Goodbye, Ambassador Silver. What did he say? I don't think Schikov will be around town much longer. And neither will we. What do you mean? I've been thinking-- when was the last time we were at the White House? Well, with you, darling, at one of those boring state dinners we attended. Why? Well, how would you like to live there? [gunshot] OK. Jeez. It is better. Mhm. Tell me something, Admiral-- how the hell did you keep the Odessa afloat? You know, apparently the boat's lower compartments automatically seal when they're flooded. You're lucky you got out when you did. It's an amazing submarine. We'll return it to the Russians, of course. After we've had a chance to check it out ourselves. Yeah. How's Lt. Swain? Ask her yourself. You're a hell of a sailor, Lieutenant. Thank you, sir. And how. Come here, Swain. Sit down. Captain Fuller, you did a fine job on that sub. I need a man like you in intelligence. To hell with that. I need a new medical officer. Good luck in finding him. I need a vacation. What about you, Swain? [music playing]
