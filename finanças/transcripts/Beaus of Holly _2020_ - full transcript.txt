She'’s not gonna do it... No way... She'’s picked the wreath. How do you do it? I know my customers and I know my cards. Amazing. Card profile him. Okay, fine. Congratulations. To his mom... for a new job... Hi. Um, can this go fast? No problem. Jennifer will ring you up. Please, fast. Oh, I see a lovely birthday card for your sister. Wait, sister? I don'’t have a sister! I saw the flowers and... my mom will be here any minute! Do you have anything else like... How about this? Wow! Perfect! Okay, is this enough? Uh... Yes, this is perfect. Thank you! Thank you! Wait! You forgot your card. Thanks, Merry Christmas! You wrote that while he was waiting. So? I'’ll take this one. Is that all? I would take them all, they'’re so perfect. I love the writing in all of them. Oh, look at that, Holly, you have a fan. You'’re the Holly of Holly'’s Cards and Stationery? Yes, that'’s me. Beautiful work! It'’s so intuitive. Thank you. I really appreciate that. And to put out your own line of cards? That'’s a lot of work. Not when you schedule everything to the second like my big sis. Well... Here you go. Merry Christmas. And Merry Christmas to both of you. Oh, my gosh! This is Phil'’s engagement ring? Can I see it? Beautiful. Okay, you'’re gonna have to tone it down. Or what are you gonna do? You'’re not gonna work here next Christmas. All right, give it back to me. And by the way, next Christmas I will be running the shop. Because you and Phil will be franchising the store all across the nation. No. We'’re gonna stick to the plan. Next year'’s the wedding. The year after that is the baby. And then after that, we franchise the store. Oh, how romantic. Spending the holidays in the mountains! Does he suspect anything? I gave him some hints, plus year two, engagement. I'’m sure he was gonna propose before the new year. But I just want this whole week to be special. Besides, there'’s nothing in the plan that says I can'’t propose first. If you get married this week, you have to let me know. I'’ll drive up! I'’m just proposing. I know, I know, but if the moment sweeps you up... We have a schedule, speaking of which... - When does your train leave? - 53 minutes. So exciting! All right. I love you. I gotta go. Love you, too. Good luck. Thank you. You'’re too amazing and you put so much planning into this. It'’s gonna be perfect. Okay. Hi! Yeah, it'’s me again. Yeah, I know our reservation is not until 10 a.m. and it'’s only 9:45. But I just wanted to make sure that our carriage driver is on his way. Because we have several reservations today that we cannot be late for... Don'’t worry, he's never late, and he'’s on his way. He is? Okay. Yeah. Thank you. Okay. Hey, Holly. Phil! Hey, stranger. - Hey, how are you? - Hey. Wow, hey. So uh, how was the train? Oh, it was amazing. It really got me in the Christmas mood. - Good, good, good. - Yeah. You should have joined me. Yeah, but I had work and stuff, yeah. You look great! Oh, thank you. Yeah, um, how was the drive up? It was good. I was on the phone most of the time. Well, you missed some really beautiful mountains. Oh, yes? Holly? What? Okay, uh... Oh, hey! "When we first started dating, we..." Wait. What are we doing? Shh! No, just... - Don'’t move. - Okay. All right, look at me. Smile? - All right. - Okay. "When we first started dating, we..." Oh! I know, this is about your new cards. Huh? No, no, no. "When we first started dating, we..." Wait. Are you breaking up with me? What? I would totally understand if... Did you think I was gonna break up with you? No. You know what? Just read, just read. - Okay. - I'’ll keep my mouth sealed. Won'’t say a word, I promise. "Phillip, I wanted to bring you here "two days before Christmas to share with you "this special memory that we are to make together. "One year ago we met. "A month later, we set up a five-year plan. And I love that we did that together." Yeah. "Well, here we are, one year later, in the beautiful town of WinterLand." Yeah. "Phillip Barnes, will you marry me?" I did it! Excited? Whoa, wow! Whoa! Whoa, good? Um... Well, um... Phil? You know, marriage is a big step. I know. Which is why you don'’t have to give me a yes right now. Hey, do you remember when we first went out? Of course. Yeah, and we both came from really long-term relationships. And we just thought it was gonna be a couple of dates. Moving on, we'’re here now. I know. We made it work. And I like our Friday date nights. Yeah, me too. When I can make them. It'’s not working out for you? Is love supposed to feel like this? Like what? Like work, like we'’re supposed to schedule everything. You know, it'’s like um-um, you know? I don'’t understand. You'’ve always liked mapping everything out together. What'’s changed? We'’re stuck. We'’re stuck in a routine, you know. I can always rearrange a schedule so it feels more random. See, that'’s just what I'’m talking about. You remember Tiffany? Your ex-girlfriend? Yeah. Total chaos, right? Like crazy. Yeah, which is why you said we worked. Maybe I need more of that or a mix or... Why are you bringing her up? Tiffany'’s a client now and I see her from time to time... Your ex is a client? Well, it'’s just a case and... - A case? - Well... Have you been seeing her? What? No, we just had dinner a few times. Dinner? Ha! Dinner? When were you gonna tell me? Listen, we never hooked up. Oh, you better not have hooked up. This better be good. No, listen. Truth is, there'’s a big difference between you and Tiffany. Really? It sounds like we'’re sharing the same man. No! No one'’s sharing me! But... Maybe I'’m not over Tiffany. Maybe I should reach out to her. Oh, clearly, you'’ve reached out! Holly, truth is, I thought you were bringing me here to break up with me! I didn'’t know why you wanted to do it here, but I was prepared to make it work. And if didn'’t work, you know, Tiffany invited me to her parents for the weekend, so... You had a backup plan? I am trying to give you my all. And I want to make sure that when I say. "yes" that I really mean it. Isn'’t that what you want? It should be a pretty easy yes or a no. No, listen, the last thing I want to do is hurt you. Bur I need to make sure that you and I can go the distance. Okay, I'’m not lying. I just can'’t move forward with you until I know how I really feel. I don'’t even know what to say! Have I just been a really long rebound this entire time? No. You were never a rebound. It'’s just you threw this marriage thing on me, and it'’s a lot. I had to erase any doubts that I have about you and I. Hopefully, we can move on with the plan like nothing ever happened. I can'’t resume with the plan like nothing ever happened if you'’re spending the most magical week of the year with your ex! I have to explore my past before I can move forward with our future. Phil, there'’s no version of this that works. If you do this, you can'’t come back. Maybe I can. I will, I will. It'’s gonna take a lot of convincing, but you know what? I'’m gonna do it and, when I do this, I'’m all in, no doubts. Goodbye, Phil. Holly! Listen! We'’re gonna make it work, I promise! Look, you don'’t know how hard this is for me! Phil and Holly! Forever. Thank you. I mean, I usually don'’t cry at all, but my plans are ruined. No hot chocolate tasting, no carriage ride, no gingerbread men, no Snowman Land, no cabin in the woods, all over this stupid, idiot jerk! This man-child! No, no, that'’s okay. You can keep it. I can dry clean it. No, no. It'’s okay. I have plenty. Please. Thank you. I'’m your coachman, Jake. At your service. Oh. I'’m not going to be able to go today, so here'’s the tickets. No, that'’s not necessary. Well, just take your girlfriend or your boyfriend or ex-girlfriend. No! Don'’t take your ex-girlfriend! No, it'’s only me. Oh, Snowdrop, I guess she could be my plus one. Anyway, let me see what you got. Well, carriage ride. Well, that'’s nice. Ooh, a hot chocolate tasting. You know, Sylvia'’s hot chocolate is the best hot chocolate in the world. It is? We got Santa'’s Workshop and a ticket to Make Your Own Gingerbread House. Well, this is like the childhood I never had all wrapped up into one. Well, thank you. Looks like today'’s gonna be pretty busy after all. Look the next train isn'’t until 3:34, so... how about this? You hang in the back of the carriage. I drive you around town and give you the tour. I'’m good. You know, this wonderfully generous woman gave me these tickets for a carriage ride out of the blue, me plus one. What do you say? I insist. All right. After you. Right here'’s the second oldest building, the Community Church. Since 1940, the church bells used to ring every single Christmas morning until they were destroyed about 10 years ago in a fire. And right up here, if you can see it, the Argo Mill. But through the month of December, it acts as Santa'’s Workshop. A lot of history there. Over here, this library Robert Frost used to visit. He had a cabin about a mile away. It'’s where he would write some of his earlier poetry. Robert Frost? He wrote his own Christmas cards to his friends. Speaking of Robert Frost, his poetry reminds me of a card my old girlfriend gave me. "Love is never gone, only asleep, waiting for your kiss." Beautiful. That wasn'’t Frost, just a card. But I never forgot those words. I'’m sorry. I'’m gonna be quiet and just shut up. I'’m just gonna drive. Adorable. Jake! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Oh, good, you'’re here! You know, Everett from Christmas Adventureland, he told me everything! Love and chocolate are perfect together! Sylvia! Oh, I'’m so sorry! Come on in anyway. No, thanks, Sylvia. We actually... we'’re just gonna take a tour of the town. Well, that'’s nonsense. Hot chocolate it is, then! Come on. It'’s worth it. Come on. Come on. Come on, Jake! She'’s gonna need her chocolate drinking buddy! Christmas is enjoyed all over the world. And in each kitchen, there'’s a different way to serve hot chocolate. The story of the Orange Peel and Chocolate comes from China, hundreds of years ago. You'’d never expect the pungent taste of the orange peel and the silky texture of the cocoa would blend together so perfectly. But against all odds, they do. Mmm. Wonderful? Mmm. Here, try this. What... what are you doing? It'’s ancho Chili Cocoa Powder. But she didn'’t tell us to do that. Just try it. Trust me. It'’s hot, but it is really good. Yeah, sometimes you just gotta mix and match. I put too much pressure on Phil. I put too much pressure on myself. What is wrong with me? Well, for one thing, you have a moustache. You got it. I'’m chocolate drunk, I think. Is that a thing? Probably, yeah. I think you should just take me back to the train station. I mean, we have... Five hours and 14 minutes? Okay, I'’m very impressed that you know that. But that'’s still five hours and 14 minutes. Okay. Oh, I guess I'’m stuck here in Christmas Wonderland. Or we could do the next thing on the tour. Snowman Land? Yeah. I only put that on there because Phil grew up in Florida and I figured he could finally build a snowman. When was the last time you built a snowman? I don'’t remember. Well? Yeah, you'’re right! Totally. Why should he have all the fun? And he shouldn'’t. And I have plenty of time until my train comes. Plenty of time. All right, Mr. Coachman. Let'’s build a snowman. I should delete his number. Would that make you feel better? We had a five-year plan. He blew it after the first year. I ever tell you about that time I worked at a ranch in Wisconsin? In the two hours that we'’ve known each other? Nope. Good point. Anyway, I volunteered at their Christmas Parade to be Santa Claus. I thought it'’d be great to, you know, ride in in my giant Gypsy Vanners, pull my Santa sleigh... Vanners? Yeah. They'’re long-haired horses, just like my pal Snowdrop. Anyway, it was also my first Christmas with my girlfriend. She wanted to spend time with me. See, but I thought, hey, I can do both. I can go to Alene'’s after the parade'’s over, except the trailer broke down. You know, somebody needed to stay with the horses and make sure they'’re warm and fed. But by the time I got to Alene'’s, it was too late and she broke up with me. I'’m sorry. Look, I made a choice and I have to live with the consequences. Well, maybe she wanted you to try harder. Maybe she wanted to see you fight for her. Look, it'’s complicated. You don'’t wanna hear my life story. I'’m sorry. That'’s probably too personal. So how'’s your snowman coming along? It'’s all done. Wait. They look the same! Yours is a traditional snowman. Mine'’s Santa Claus. Santaman. Santaman. Where'’s the hat? That'’s a box. It'’s a Santa Claus hat. You gotta think outside the box. What do you say to a Make Your Own Gingerbread House? Got two tickets, and it'’s a bakery. Do they have gluten-free Red Velvet cupcakes? Yeah, they do. I'’m in. I think the porch should be a complete wrap-around. Can you hand me these brownies right here? Look. I'’m designing the dream house me and Phil were supposed to live in. I have to stop. Want to take a break? I just can'’t believe I misread this whole entire thing. It'’s my job to know what people are thinking. What, are you psychic? No. I write greeting cards for a living. Cards? Like you buy... At a card shop. I mean, I guess I never really thought about it, you know. It'’s like you open the card and it says Happy Birthday or Merry Christmas. It kind of writes itself. So wait. Let me ask you this. Do you write the funny stuff like with the cartoons, cats and dogs dressed as Santa Claus... No. You know that stuff that poem you read in the carriage? Yeah. I wrote that. Wow! Man, that'’s impressive. Thank you. Okay, I got it! Can you hand me those load-bearing crispy treats so I can fortify the house? Yeah. Here you go. Thanks. I have one last wall. Voila! Very nice. If I ever build a real gingerbread house, I'’ll be sure to call you as the contractor. If you'’re ever gonna have anything built, you'’re gonna hire Everett. Everett? Yeah, he'’s my boss. The cabins you were supposed to stay at, he built most of those. He also owns Christmas Holiday Adventures. Well, you'’ll have to tell him thank you for me. The pictures of the cabin looked very beautiful. They really are. You'’re missing out. You really love it up here. Yeah, yeah, I do. Well, it'’s a shame I'm not gonna be sticking around for long. I feel like Ms. Scrooge and I'’m in no mood to be visited by any ghost from my Christmas past. You looking for the delete button? I was just kidding. Listen, it makes total sense. You delete him, no looking back. You just have your future to look forward to. But what if you need... Life shouldn'’t be about the what-ifs. It should be about the what-nows. How'’s that feel? Fine. Yeah, feels fine. Good. Well, if we'’re done with the house, we can continue on with our tour. Okay. Food for the reindeer. Nice. It'’s getting cold. Yeah, clouds are coming in. I hear there'’s snow in the forecast. I know. Snow makes it a perfect Christmas week. Couldn'’t have planned it better. You can'’t plan everything, you know. I can try. Come on, but no spontaneity, no randomness ever? This? Right here with you? This is pretty spontaneous, especially for me. And how does it feel? Weird. I mean, not that you'’re weird. No. You know, like this whole thing is weird. Let me ask you. Are you always like this? Like what? You know, organizing everything. Yeah. I'’ve been teased about it my whole life. But I'’ve gotten this far because I can plan and I can follow through. I'’m not making fun of you. I'’m actually jealous. Jealous? Yeah. So what are your plans for Christmas Day? I'’m gonna wake up, gonna get on a train and heading a east of Seattle. I'’m sorry, what? I'’m leaving. On Christmas Day? No tree, no presents? I know. I get it. Are you visiting family? No. Did you clear that with Snowdrop? I have a job starting in the new year. That'’s why I'm going. Oh. Why? Nothing. I have one more ticket. What about your train? I have an hour and 36 minutes. Santa'’s Workshop? Exactly. I'’m gonna make you a going-away present. Going-away present. Do I get a say in this? It'’s a thank-you for helping me with today. Let'’s go. - Right! Great! - Let'’s go. Like I mentioned, what makes the Argo mill really special is that, every Christmas, it'’s turned into Santa'’s Workshop. So, you know, all the kids can get an early glimpse at Santa and Mrs. Claus. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas, Santa. Just the two of you? No kids? - No kids. - No kids. Ah, the two tickets for a young couple in love. Glad you could make it. Mrs. Claus, could you take these two young lovers to the table? Actually... Okay, here are the rules. Don'’t play with the glitter, don'’t run with scissors. Don'’t paint each other. That never turns out well... and don'’t eat the glue. Wait. Can we make popcorn garlands? Have you ever made that before? Mm-mm. It'’s my favorite Christmas activity. We ran out of popcorn about two hours ago, thanks to Santa. Have fun, kids. What are you doing? Making an ornament. This was my Christmas gift to you. I told you I love Christmas. Please. You'’re leaving on Christmas. Well, that'’s because that's when the train leaves. Okay, Mr. I Love Christmas. Time for a test. Uh-oh. Presents? Morning or evening? Oh, morning. Christmas Eve, ham or turkey? Now that'’s a trick question, because Christmas Eve is prime rib. Christmas Day, turkey. Homemade cranberry sauce or rubber out of the can? Oh, rubber out of the can. Oh, you failed that one. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. With chunks of real cranberries in the rubbery mess. Eww! It'’s good. Well, I make a mean cranberry sauce. It'’s my mother's secret recipe. Oranges and cinnamon, it will convert you. Yeah, my dad used to have a secret recipe for turkey. Every time he was home on Christmas, it tasted like perfection. He never taught me how to make it, though. Did he travel a lot? Yeah, we all did, base to base. Oh, a military brat! Oh, yeah, that'’s me. Pretty bratty. My parents got divorced when I was 12, though. And Christmas hasn'’t been the same ever since. This is Christmas perfection. You know, I would love to travel. But what you do is on a whole '’nother level. Oh, life doesn'’t have to be that complicated if you just let it happen. You need to experience more if you'’re going to be writing those cards. The cards are about emotions, what'’s in the heart, not about places. Hmm. You know, you remind me of my sister, Jenn. Really? Everything'’s so new and exciting to her. She'’s always searching for that inspiration. But I know how to laugh, I know how to love. I know how to say I'’m sorry. You don'’t need to travel the world to understand those things. I'’m gonna go look for some more tinsel. Hey, Tif! You actually came. I live my life the way I want to live it. If I want to go to Seattle or Kansas whenever I want, I can. She'’s out of your league. Okay, first off, I'’m just showing her around town. And, secondly, why... why do you say that? Because I'’m Santa! My sister loves to challenge everything, but not me. I'’m the practical one, the dependable one. And yet she'’s the one that'’s always happy. Maybe she'’s doing it right. Hmm? Oh, yes, sweetheart, just add more glitter. Timing is everything. There'’s nothing to talk about, all right? I'’m just her driver with a horse and I leave in two days. I guess you'’re gonna need a Christmas miracle, won'’t you? Yeah, yeah, Christmas miracle. Thanks, Santa. No problem. Do you notice Mrs. Claus keeps winking at me? Yeah. You better watch out. She'’s gonna get you. They'’re awfully cute, aren'’t they? Mm-hm. What it is about connecting? Why is it so difficult? Well, if it were easy, you'’d be out of business. I guess we'’re all looking for that one person that we can relate to. I thought Phil was the one. Does he plan everything, too? Yeah. He'’s a lawyer, so he's always like three steps ahead. The crazy thing is I found it sexy, which now makes me feel like I was being played the whole time. I mean, maybe, or maybe he was telling the truth. Maybe he thought that he was saving the other person by letting them go. How do you save someone by leaving? Love is complicated. No. The love part, that'’s easy. You shouldn'’t have to run away. That first part, when you first fall in love, you shouldn'’t have to second-guess. When you'’re really truly in love, there'’s only question you should ask: What can I do to spend the rest of my life with this person? Wow. That'’s really good. You should put that in one of the cards. But without all your hard work and planning, you wouldn'’t have been able to waste a day with me. It wasn'’t a waste. Mistletoe! Dude, totally misreading the moment. Yes, read the room, Santa. Ho! Ho! Ho! Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! What time are you leaving on Christmas? My train leaves at 9:36 a.m., early. I guess I'’ll go to my folk'’s house for Christmas. Nice. I'’ll arrive at seven a.m., help my mom set up breakfast. My dad will get up at 7:30 a.m. and eats and help. - It'’ll be nice. - Nice. Jenn will call and say that she'’s running late at 10:00 and ask us to wait to open up presents from Santa. When I was a kid, I used to stay up all night trying to catch Santa Claus. - Really? - Yep. I did that until I was about 12. Just until 12? I still do it. One day I'’m gonna catch him. When I do, when I catch Santa, it'’s gonna be Christmas every day in my house. Oh, my gosh. So are you ready? 40 minutes until your train leaves. 43 minutes. 43 minutes. Of course, you knew that. That'’s it! That'’s what? Holly, what? This was the church I wanted to get married at. It'’s a beautiful church. That'’s one of the first buildings in town. You wanna go inside? No. - Really? Sure? - I don'’t... no. See that two-ton church bell up there? It used to ring every single holiday. About 10 years ago, it got struck by lightning. That actually saved the church, but it hasn'’t rang since. Sorry. It'’s the tour guide in me, A lot of information, huh? So no more tickets, huh? That was the last one. Well, Christmas snow'’s coming in just like in your plan. Well, guess we should get back to the train. You'’ve already made this day way more fun than it should have been. Hey, excuse me! Hey! Excuse me, I... Are you okay? Pastor Tony, slow down! Can you... Sorry. You need some water? I can get you some water off my carriage. Okay. You two, I need you to be witnesses to a marriage. - Oh, no... - Please! I'’ve been running up and down main street. And everybody else is either running around looking for last-minute gifts or already with their loved ones. I got to get her back to her train before it leaves. I really do. I'’m sorry. Oh. Okay. I'’ll just try to find somebody else. A day before Christmas Eve, it shouldn'’t be too hard. Not hard at all. We'’ll do it! - Really? - Yeah. My name is Holly. Holly, that'’s so great, that'’s so fantastic. Holly, if the 3:34 train leaves. You'’ll miss it, you'll have to stay at the cabin. I'’ll be fine. We'’ll make the train. She'’ll make the train. Yes. - Yes? - I'’m good. - She'’s good! - I'’m good. - I mean, if you'’re good... - Let'’s go! Okay. They came in about twenty minutes ago, a whim. Young love. The mountains will do that to you. Normally, I have Mr. Fallon here. He plays the mandolin during the service. But he is busy setting up our new church bells. Oh, it'’s so beautiful. The sounds it'’s going to make! And on Christmas morning! So blessed... Sorry, I'’m off track... anyway, I really appreciate this. So this is David and Jill. - Oh, sorry. - Hi. This is our lovely couple that'’s getting married today. - Hi. - Congratulations. - Congratulations, yeah. Thanks. Well, great, now that we have witnesses, will you marry us, Pastor Tony? Of course. Let me get set up. We really appreciate you doing this. Are you two married? - No! - No. - No, we'’re not married. - Oh, sorry. It'’s just... Love is in the air. What happened to your witnesses? We didn'’t know we needed them. Yeah. We just decided to get married today. So this wasn'’t planned? - No! - No! We actually just met last week. Isn'’t that so romantic? So it'’s like a spur of the moment kind of thing? Yes! Is she gonna be okay? Listen. I mean, when you know, you know, right? I knew the second that I said I needed a piece of gum. Oh... He went from shop to shop to shop to try and get me a piece! And I knew when her favorite movie was "Lilo and Stitch"! Yes! - I love you. - I love you so much. Knock it off, you two. There'’ll be plenty of time for that. Sorry, sorry. We'’re just, um... - We'’re really excited. - Really excited. Why don'’t you guys come on up here? See? Being spontaneous can be exhilarating. We are gathered here today by the skin of our teeth... To witness the union of David and Jill, a lovely couple brought together by divine intervention, otherwise known as a stick of gum. Are you two ready? Yes, yes. I have my vows in here. Okay. "Love is never gone, only sleeping." That'’s your card. Come on! We can still make it! We still have time! Come on! No, no! No, no, no! What happened? The train has a mind of its own. But it had a schedule and I printed it and memorized it! Look, I'’ll tell you what. I'’ll get Snowdrop comfy in the stables, all right? I'’ll grab my truck and I'’ll drive you down the mountain back to the city. No, no, no. That is too much! No, it'’s not. Come on. Don'’t be ridiculous. You should be with your loved ones, it'’s Christmas. But you'’re off the clock! I want to do this, okay? Tell you what. A gift to you. "One free mountain ride." Yep. You gave me a ticket. It'’s the least I can do. Okay. Okay? But can I sit up front? That might be pushing it. Come on, let'’s go. Did it take you a while to learn how to do this? - What? This? - Yeah. Driving? Nah. When you have a teacher like Snowdrop, it'’s easy. You wanna try? Oh, no, no. Come on, drive. - No. I... - Take the reins. Here. - Ready? - I cannot. Take the reins. Wait. I don'’t know what I'’m doing! You can steer. Here. This is how you steer. - Right to left, this. - Okay. Pull that way. This, pull that way. - Oh my God. - Come on, you can do it. Okay. - Here we go! - Giddyap, giddyap! - You'’re a natural! - I'’m doing it! Oh, my God, this is so much fun! Whoa! Why'’d she stop? Not a fan of the bridge. Oh, is she scared? No, the uneven wood. She'’s gotta take it slowly. All right, let'’s go, Snowdrop. Nice and slow. - Great job, girl. - She did it! Mm, okay. You guys want anything? Mr. and Mrs. Parker, do you want some eggnog? No? Babe, no? Okay. Ooh! Find what you'’re looking for? Yeah. Do you have anything Christmassy? What? Are we eight? I thought Christmas was about us being together. But no eggnog? Seriously? No. I'’m just saying, no Christmas music? You know my parents don'’t want to be distracted. Look, honey, tomorrow is Christmas Eve. You and I should go into town and have a great night. Maybe get some prime rib... Sweetie, I'’m vegan. Vegan? Okay. Wow. Well, how are we gonna do Christmas turkey? We'’re not. Okay. Um, okay, I hear you. And I understand that you'’re a new vegetarian... Vegan. But that started like two days ago. What? Does that not make it valid? No, no. I'’m just saying that you can eat the green beans and soymilk. But maybe... maybe your parents, they want Christmas turkey. Clearly, they ate Vixen or Dasher or one of those reindeers... Phil? Okay, all right. Phillip, calm down. My parents love me. And if I'’m gonna eat raw green bans and soymilk, so will they. The question is, will you? I think I could do a little kale. There we go. - Thank you. - All right. Okay, you guys want to watch a Christmas movie? Hey, Snowdrop. I'’ll try to be quiet here. Is she gonna be okay? Yeah, just gotta give her some food and water to keep her metabolism up for the cold. Okay. Bye, Snowdrop. Bye, Snowdrop. This place is amazing. You get to work with all these animals. Yeah, I'’m gonna miss 'em. Here'’s Everett. Offer still stands, Jake. Everett... Hey, this is... Let me guess. You must be the 9:45 lady. Oh, and you must be the one I talked to on the phone earlier today. Yes, ma'’am. Well, you were right. He wasn'’t late. Oh, Jake'’s always reliable. So let me guess. You'’re here for the cabin. Actually, no. I'’m not gonna stay. Jake'’s gonna drive me back home down the mountain. Y'’all best get a hurry on before the temperature drops. Oh, that'’s my phone. An alert. They said it'’s closed. Of course. Yep. Highway 85. Freezes over every time the temperature drops below 30. Too dangerous to cross, Jake. Yeah. Okay, change of plans. Do you want to take her to the cabin? Yeah, yeah. I'’ll do that. Don'’t worry about going to the carriage. I put her luggage in the back of the truck. Perfect. I'’ll bring them right up to you. You come with me, young lady. Watch your step. There'’s no way in the world I was gonna let you go up that highway like that. So where'’s your boyfriend? I thought this was supposed to be a romantic Christmas week for two. It didn'’t work out. Oh, I'’m sorry. So, uh, what are you gonna do when Jake leaves? You applying for the job, young lady? No. I actually have a card shop in the city... I was just kidding. I'’m just playing. I ain'’t gonna lie to you. I'’d love to retire. I'’d love to leave all of this to Jake. So he'’s leaving. - Maybe. - Maybe? Let me put it to you like this. I know Jake wants to stay. He just hasn'’t found the right reason yet. Well, sometimes you just need to move on, right? Sometimes what you'’re looking for is right in front of you. Come on. Cabin 2B, the Frost house. After you. Robert Frost used to come up here back in the day. - You heard of him? - Of course. This is it. Make yourself at home, young lady. This is where Robert Frost stayed? Where he sat? Where he ate? Where he wrote? I take it that you'’re a fan. "Two roads diverged in a yellow wood. "And I... I took the road less traveled by. And that made all the difference." Wow. He would love to hear young people recite his poetry. Did you know him? Me? Oh, no, no, no, ma'’am. My parents did, though. Heard stories growing up. Oh! Knock, knock! Oh, thank you, buddy. All right, I got your stuff. - Glad you'’re here. - Yeah. I'’m gonna go get Snowdrop prepped for the temperature drop tonight. Okay. You need help? Oh, no, no, no, no. You stay here and take care of this pretty young lady. And you, ma'’am, if you need anything, emergency number is right there by the phone. Thank you. Oh, no, no, no. Thank you, ma'’am. Thanks, Everett. So where do you... Yeah, put that stuff down. Put it right here. - All right. - Yeah. - That'’s a lot of stuff. - Yeah. Oh, wow. Nice holiday cheer. Yep. Spiced wine. Phil and I were supposed to be celebrating. Now I guess it'’s just for a party of one. The turkey, the dressing, cranberry sauce? Well, Phil was supposed to bring the turkey and the dressing. But I brought the cranberry sauce. I guess now I'’ll just do the decorations. Do you want to join me? I'’m sorry. You probably have to pack. Never mind. Actually, do you know what? I'’ll be right back. Yes. Knock, knock again. Oh! Are you kidding me? Nope. This was supposed to be my last meal before I left. But you can'’t have Christmas without a tree. Well, let'’s celebrate Christmas! Let'’s celebrate. I think we did good here. Yeah, yeah. I guess if you "like" Christmas, it'’s okay. I thought you "loved" it. Oh, please. I love Christmas and this is beautiful. - Thank you. - You'’re welcome. - Cheers. - Cheers. It'’s my sister. - Hey, Jenn. - Hey, sis. - Are you really coming back? - Hey, no. The snow came in so I'’m not gonna come back '’til Friday. Wait. What? Hello? I'’m surprised you get any reception. I guess having lousy reception might be a plus staying up here, huh? Yeah. Yeah, it is. And you wanna leave all this? Oh, I'’ll just find somewhere else that has bad internet. I don'’t know how you live like that. It'’s a result of a nomadic childhood. Guess it doesn'’t really give room for relationships. Yeah, I'’ve had those, but traveling in the world and falling in love just don'’t see eye to eye. Is that what happened to the one who gave you my note card? No, actually, I did her a favor by leaving. She just didn'’t know it. You left her? I thought she broke up with you. Well, it kinda works both ways. You know, she gave me a second chance and I broke her heart. I never felt like I was enough for her. I couldn'’t give her everything she wanted. Is that what she told you? No. I mean... Truth is, she loved me as is, all of me. But by the time I saw that, it was too late. Well, Jake... I see you as is, all of you. And I think you'’re pretty wonderful. Well, Holly... Is that so? Yes, that'’s so. And that'’s my signal to fix the transformer. Do you really have to go out there in that? Yeah, one last hurrah. I'’ll get the fire started before I get outta your way. Will you come by tomorrow... if you don'’t have to pack? Packing only takes two minutes. My cabin'’s next door, so if you need anything, just... Goodnight, Jake. Goodnight. Oh... It'’s so cold. Holly! Holly, it'’s Jake! Jake? Holly. - You okay? You frozen? - Oh, it'’s freezing! Get in! It'’s so cold. Right. The thermostat broke last night. Went out again like 20 minutes ago. I have a linesman coming to fix it in a few. Just wanted to check on you. - You good? - Yeah, I'’m good. - I'’m gonna start a fire. - Okay. What'’s in the bag? Oh, just a little more Christmas. Everyone needs a Santa to watch over them. You'’re serious! You really kidnapped Santa! Well, he'’ll do until I catch the real one. Oh, my gosh. Beautifully done. Yeah, we should be at a thawing temperature in about 10 minutes. Amazing. Ah... Do you wanna stay for breakfast? Yes, that would be nice. Okay, good. - Okay. - Yeah. Well, let me go get dressed. Then I'’ll come back. Okay. I'’ll see if the linesmen are here. Meet you here in 15? Yeah, that'’s a good idea. - Okay. - Perfect. Breakfast was great. Thank you. Oh, thanks for getting the electricity to work again. That'’s my one super power. Well, with great power comes great responsibility. So what else is on schedule aside from quoting Spiderman? I don'’t know. What do you mean, you don'’t know? I have no plans for the first time ever. Huh, no plans. How does that feel? Pretty... pretty good. Well, we can do whatever you want to do. Snowball fight? Oh, you'’re so gonna get it. - Yeah! - That'’s all you have? Oh! Ah! Give me more than that. - All right. - Come on. Bring it! Oh! Oh, no, are you okay? Woo-hoo! I'’m glad you found something Christmassy to do. Well, I mean, it would be a lot easier if someone was helping me. Babe, you really don'’t have to wrap those. We usually just find a shopping bag and stick it under the tree. No! That'’s... that's crazy! Well, I'’m sorry we all don'’t own a wrapping paper store like Holly. Look, this isn'’t on me. I warned you, my parents just like to keep a low-key Christmas. I know you warned me. But I thought you just meant they don'’t dress up for dinner or use fine silver or go caroling. I didn'’t know it was BYOC. What'’s BYOC? Bring your own Christmas. Get up! Come here! You are the only one who cares about the presents being wrapped. Because it'’s Christmas! You wrap gifts for kids! Do you see any kids here? - No, but... - Exactly! This is a no-kids zone! Since when are you some Christmas groupie? I am not a Christmas groupie, okay? This is not Christmas! We are in a snowy cabin with a beautiful fire on Christmas Eve. How is this not Christmassy enough for you? It'’s like "The Nightmare Before Christmas". What is that supposed to mean? Hey, I didn'’t ask you to come over here after you dumped your rebound. What? She is not a rebound, okay? Okay, she... Oh, my God, Phil! You have to make up your mind on what you want because this is not working for me on Christmas Eve! You know what, this isn'’t working for me either. Don'’t move! I can'’t believe you hit me with a rock. I told you, it was a pebble in the snow. It was a projectile and you were trying to took my head off. You'’re just mad because I was winning. Oh, right. Oh, that'’s probably Santa Claus putting you on the naughty list for deliberately hitting me. I gotta take this. Your sister? Guessing it'’s her sister. Hello? I really want to get back together. I can barely hear you. I made a huge mistake. I was so dumb. What am I thinking? What do you think I'’m thinking? You'’re right. I wasn'’t thinking. I can'’t even hear you. Let me just call you on Monday, okay? I know I was confused. But I know 100% now that... that... I love you. You love me? Great! You love me, too! That'’s... No! No! I did not... That'’s great, baby. Listen, you don'’t know how relieved I am. Like I'’m so relieved right now. Hey, are you at the... Cabin... we rented? No, no, no. Don'’t come here! Okay, '’cause I'm coming. No, no! All right, great. I'’ll see you soon. No! Hello? Holly? What? All right. Love you. Love you. You okay? Yeah, I'’ll make some chestnuts. I love chestnuts. Um, there'’s a power outage in the north cabin. I'’m gonna go take care of it. You have to go? Yeah. I'’ll be back and I'’ll bring more Christmas. More than this? Yeah, I'’m like Santa Claus, my bag that just keeps on giving. Hey, uh, hey, babe. Who were you talking to? Um... Huh? I, um... You know, it'’s not important. That was her, wasn'’t it? I thought you said it was over between you and Holly. You know, you'’re ruining Christmas! Christmas? Christmas? You call this Christmas? This is not Christmassy. I have never seen my mom and dad in such a happy mood! How can you even tell? Just get out! You know what? That'’s a good idea. You know what, Tiff? Listen, I'’m sorry... and you deserve better. Oh, I know I deserve better. And I know you know. I'’m just saying if I stay here, we would both be miserable and that'’s not a life. I think you'’re confused. I have a life, remember? You'’re the one that pursued me. You came into my life. You took me to dinner. Well, you were hungry. I'’m always hungry. Why do you think I turned vegan? Honestly, now that you'’re here in my life, you want out? Grow up, Phillip! I broke up with you a year and a half ago and I'’m doing it again now! Do not come back! Okay. That'’s a good idea, okay. Want me to shut the door? Just go! Oh, Holly, I'’m coming for you. Never again will I do that. Nope, nope. I don'’t know what I was thinking, Phil. Oh... ah! Come on! Come on, baby! Come on! Come on! Come on! Dang it! Come in! That took awhile, but looks like you finally got the power on for everyone. Yes, everybody is nice and toasty for Christmas Eve. Popcorn! For Popcorn garlands. You remembered. Got something else. Whoa! It'’s off the carriage. Gift from Snowdrop. Aw, she'’s a pretty amazing horse. Listen, I know you probably don'’t want any memorabilia from these last couple of days, but I just thought... No, I do want to remember it. Thank you for everything. I wish I had something to give you in return. Is that Santa? Phil? Can I come in? Come here. - Oh, my God! What? - Set him down, set him down. You'’re freezing! Get some blankets. Get him warm, get him warm. I... broke... my phone. You could have died out there. Do you think we should call him an ambulance? Does he need one? I think we can thaw him out. Hold on. Okay. Go in the bathroom, put this shirt on. - The bath... - Bathroom'’s over here. - Okay. - Right there. Phil, when you'’re finished in there, please join us for Christmas Eve, so you can have something hot to eat and thaw out. I messed up. Oh, it'’s so funny. I really thought that you said come over. I did. I thought you said it. I did. Holly, you'’re right. The homemade cranberry sauce is much better. You converted me. Thank you. So who are you again? Jake. Little Jake. Thanks for the kiddie shirt. It'’s a little bit extra small, but, you know, thanks. Thanks. Nice Christmas tree. So Holly tells me that you'’re a lawyer. Correct. I'’m a defense attorney. I represent insurance corporations. Hmm. So you work here at the cabins like a maid or something? Wear the little... Jake, actually, he drove me around town yesterday. Oh, like an Uber driver. That'’s nice. With a horse. He was our carriage driver, remember? Right, right, right, like a jockey. Well, you'’re surely the right height. So it'’s Christmas Eve. Why don'’t we get that fire started? You'’re right! Christmas Eve. Too bad we don'’t have presents to open up, right, Jake? Actually, my family always opened up presents on Christmas morning. What about your house? Oh, no, sucks to be poor. We'’d open presents on Christmas Eve and Christmas morning. Oh, especially New Years. Those are the best. Well, lucky you. Yeah. Hard work pays off. So why don'’t you open presents on Christmas Eve, again? Well, it'’s probably because Santa hasn'’t come down the chimney yet, right? Oh, okay. Well, you know, you have to open up presents on Christmas Eve so Santa has more room to put more presents. Isn'’t that right, Jack? His name is Jake. Sorry. So how about that popcorn garland? Yeah, let'’s do that. Okay, fine. I see where this is going. You know what? I have some work to get done. Can I borrow your tablet... where I know the password? Hey, do you have internet here? You know what that is, right? You know what? It'’s Christmas Eve. You almost died out there. Why don'’t you just take it easy for once? Well, as tempting as sewing popcorn sounds, I have Christmas emails to send out. I'’m surprised you didn'’t do that already. I did, but I missed a few, maybe more than a few. That'’s not very Christmassy. Well, good thing you'’ve got Jesse over here to keep you company. It'’s Jake. All right. I'’m sorry. It'’s all right. Here you go. - Nice. - All right. All right, let'’s do this. Good! Done! Oh, and so are we. Really? But you were working. I was sending out Christmas emails. Well, you know, I'’m gonna clean up and get outta your way. Why? Why leave now? We'’re just having fun. Well, you two have a lot to talk about. I'’m actually leaving in the morning, so... Leaving? Like moving? Leaving forever and ever and never ever coming back? - Yeah. - He'’s moving to Seattle. You don'’t have to... I mean, I guess he could stay a little. You were supposed to not come. He needs to go! You need to. You know on the phone, I said "do not come." I barely left and you moved on! I thought you loved me! I thought you loved me. I needed to think about it. I needed to think... I said let me think about it and you said "okay" and I was like, "I'’m glad you understand." You are not supposed to be here. You know that I said... Okay. So I'’m gonna... gonna get going. You don'’t have to go. Yeah, yeah, I do. Okay. - I'’ll see you. - All right. Excuse me. Jake, what was that all about? Excuse me? What happened? You'’re angry. Listen, you have a guy who came back to you waiting in there. So he gets to decide and you get to decide what'’s best for me? Like you did with Alene? How about I get to decide what'’s best for me? You can'’t deny that you don'’t feel this. When you know, you know. Look, you have a five-year plan that doesn'’t end until you jump off of it. My plan ends with a 9:36 train the moment I jump on it. Just call it what it is. You'’re running away in the morning. I'’m not running away. Good night, Holly. Holly, I was... Hey, Holly! Hey! Come here! Come here! Stand right there. Don'’t move. Look at me. All right. Holly, at the train staion I made the biggest mistake of my life. Holly, will you marry me? Phil! Stop, wait. Is this my ring? Yeah, yeah. I found it in the bathroom when I was thawing out. But that'’s not the point. The point is... I made the biggest mistake of my life when I left. Phil, stop, no... Look, when you proposed, it freaked me out and I was scared. And I'’m sorry, so let's go with the five-year plan... No, Phil, sStop! And then we can get married next year. We can buy a house and have kids and travel... Phil... And then we can open up a franchise for your store. No. Forget the plan! This is me living now in the moment. And... you left me for someone else. That really hurt. It was just one day. But it wasn'’t like three months. I did it for us. There is no justification for why you did it except that you didn'’t love me enough. I declare a mistrial! This isn'’t court! It is and you'’re my judge. Your Honor, I plead temporary insanity. Hey, come on. It'’s Christmas. This isn'’t a get out of jail for free card. I know. I have a lot to think about. I know and I'’m sorry. I'’ll give you time. It'’s Christmas Eve. I don'’t wanna be angry. I don'’t either. But you really broke my heart yesterday. I know. I was so dumb. I don'’t know if I'm gonna be able to forgive you. And it'’s definitely not gonna be tonight. Well, I'’m patient. So I'’m gonna go to sleep and I'’ll talk to you in the morning. Okay. - Oh, right... - Right there. Okay. Couch. Goodnight. Hopefully, I don'’t scare Santa. Okay. Is this Christmassy enough for you? You'’ll never catch me, Jake. And you won'’t catch Holly either! Ho, ho, ho, ho! You can'’t beat me. You can'’t beat me. Oh, hey! - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. So, what'’s up? Still stuck on that cowboy? You said last night that you needed my Christmas spirit. What do you think I need from you? It was okay when you didn'’t know the answer to that. But I know what I want now. Look, I just made one mistake, but I came back. I came back for you because I love you. Phil, you never loved me. You just loved the idea of me. I don'’t matter to you. And I need to matter. I think I knew deep down somewhere in my heart, that this wasn'’t gonna work. But I was so busy thinking about you and us that I wasn'’t checking in with me. The truth is, we don'’t belong together. And now that I'’m finally able to admit that, I can'’t go back and ignore it. I'’ll always have love for you, but I'’m not gonna take you back. But this is Christmas! We'’re Christmas, you and me! Hey, wait. Where are you going? What happened last night? Actually, you did. I what? When you came back, you confirmed what I already knew. Why are you hurting me? How does this help me? It'’s helping the both of us. We both need to move on. Holly! Wait! Holly! Holly? Hey, Tiffany. Merry... hello? Jake? Jake? Are you still here? Holly? Hey, Everett! Good morning. Merry Christmas, Holly. Merry Christmas. Did I miss him? Did he leave already? Yeah. He moped around here a little bit. But I kicked him out about an hour ago. You kicked him out? Yes, ma'’am. I didn'’t want him to miss the last train. But Jake did want me to give this book to you. It'’s a Robert Frost First Edition. Yes, it is. Jake said you would appreciate it. You okay? I have to get to the station. That'’s not possible. There'’s no way in the world you can get down there. The road'’s are iced over. You can'’t hike that within 23 minutes. I have to try. I have an idea. You can do this, come on, girl. I need some Christmas magic. That'’s the way you do it, Snowdrop, good girl. Come on, hurry up! Go faster. Stay, Snowdrop. Stay. No! No, no! No, no, no! Stop! Stop! Holly? Looks like those lessons came in handy. Well, I had a good teacher. Snowdrop. Yeah, we'’re talking about you. You were right. Being spontaneous is exhilarating. Why aren'’t you on the train? Well, I... I was gonna ask Everett if he was still interested in selling. So you'’re staying? Yeah, I'’m staying. I thought you were getting married. I said no. I really wanted to apologize to you. Yeah, I, um... I owe you an apology, too. Apology accepted. Apology accepted. Thank you for the book. Thank you for the card. You certainly know how to write from the heart. I was kinda hoping you would read that before you left on the train. "“You wander the roads less traveled. "You pick the lonely blue highways. "Protecting yourself behind trees and valleys. "You shield yourself from falling in love. "But like the journey... "Love is when you experience life'’s greatest adventures. "I hope you find it. "And when you find it... I hope you fight for it." I want to fight for it. You know, I heard someplace that, when you find true love, there'’s only one question you should be asking yourself. And what is that? What can I do to spend the rest of my life with this person? It works! It works! The bell! It works! Hey, Merry Christmas! - Merry Christmas! - Merry Christmas! - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas.
