Leila, my daughter, today you are twenty. You are at the start of your life; you’ve no need of my advice as to how to live it. We used to say: don’t trust any guy older than twenty. Today, I am nearly three times that age. I’d kept some tapes locked up in the basement, I got them out and edited them; and they are my present to you: I am telling you about my life when I was twenty. When I filmed these pictures, I hadn’t met your mother yet, it was different life. Till when? For ever. And now a song in memory of Bader and the others, who've all died in the Stammheim prison. Freedom through work! What a rowdy lot your friends are. The music is deafening. - But... - It's completely tuneless. Don't start. It's my birthday, OK? When it's your birthday you can choose the music. Thanks for everything. Is your buddy going to film it all? I think he's practising. He's at the Art College. His parents have dough but he's nice. Everything had started that day. I’d said to myself that Charlie’s birthday party... was a good opportunity to get to know... how to work with this new equipment, borrowed from the Art school. I think I'm ready now. I was fascinated by those parties, where couples got together and fell apart. I was shy and even a little uptight. Behind my camera, I could hide from the world. That was the day I saw them for the first time. They said: we must destroy what is destroying us. And again: the system eats into us like cancer, let’s strike the headquarters of the system. I didn’t understand till later. I simply had to film them. They’d noticed it, were surprised at my centring them. At first I thought there’d be trouble, but they merely asked questions about my gear. Then they asked me... to come and see them the following week. So the idea now is... for us to introduce ourselves to the camera. First we must explain something. We've already talked about it enough, I think. Wait, Guy, could you speak a bit louder, please? - But I... are you already shooting? - Yes. No, but I've not begun yet, I... Would you like to stop now and start again? - Or can I just get going? - No, just get going. I'm shooting. You're on. Fire ahead! Well, my name is Guy. Guy Probst. I'm a trained teacher. I think... tell me briefly who you are but... Basically it's not this that's important, I think we must... focus on our combat and... Up till now we've undertaken... proletarian seizure missions, acts of sabotage, attacks against bourgeois clowning... and capitalist repression. But today we are entering a new stage in our offensive. From now on... we're going to attack the heart of the system. My name is Charlie, I'm twenty years old. I'm a working girl, daughter of workers, thrown out like crap by their bosses when they became ill. I'm an antifascist activist, squatter, rocker, feminist, and we're going to give the arseholes... who repress the proletariat a good lesson. Power to the people. I'm a revolutionary combatant. I love heroin. I love drugs. Is that OK? No, let's stop there. You talk and talk! But at least I stick to the theme. Let's leave it at that. Stop getting worked up! Ok, revolution has no borders! Is that good? Now perhaps Virginie. I'm an anti-imperialist. Founding member... of the "Autonomous Revolutionary Group GAR". Before that I was an active member of the "Red Group". I think that our basic intention... is that we are ready to stay the course. Now, to see our combat through till the end. To do so, we shall be ready for anything. We are united in our action, a collective! And our action is a collective one. Therefore it's not necessary... to mention individual careers, they've no relevance. Well, that's all. Like a cigarette? No, only a draw. It will relax me. They said they had a project, they wouldn’t tell me any more, they just wanted to know... if I agreed to film them when they told me to. The pictures had to remain confidential, just like everything else I’d see or hear. They said: becoming clandestine... is not the same as entering a cinema. But I was curious, I said: yes. A few weeks later, Guy asked me to come to Virginie’s with my camera. This was my last chance to say no; I missed it, I found myself committed. "to attempt to behave like humans... and not like cogs in the capitalist machine." "In hairdressers' saloons you'd see anarchist flyers, as hairdressers were mostly anarchists... announcing that hairdressers were no longer slaves." - Are you filming? - Yes, I am. - Is that for the film? - Yes, you can start. What's the result of the Malville demo? One person dead. One death too many. Yes, but what else? Other than Michalon's death, I can't think of anything. All right, but why are people talking about it? Not only because of Michalon's death, but also because of nuclear energy and its dangers? People talk about the anti-nuclear movements, because these are really mass movements. Does that satisfy you? Yes. Malville is only remembered, because everyone has seen it. On television, in the papers. Because Malville was a show, like what we see every day. Because the pictures exist. But it's not only the pictures. Only because of the pictures! But of course, that's why I say too... we must conduct our combat like a show. Yes, like a show. The alienation from the consumer society... must be combated with the same arms. The arms for a show. Our combat must be an entertainment. It must be an entertainment, a permanent entertainment. And shown on television. That's why you're here. You see? - Hugues. - Yes? Will it be possible... to see what you've filmed? Before, if you... No problem, you'll be able to see everything. - It's important for us to... - I was good, no? I don't know. Everything's been said. That was good! I won't say any more. You don't want to say any more? No. This is superficial. I don't want to... Was I good? No! Once again, we don't agree. At our next meeting, I'd like to talk about this. Come on, Guy! Stop it, that's ludicrous. I didn't want to vex you. That's absurd. We can have our say, can't we? We can exchange our views. If you only want monologues. Baltos had a plan. We've talked a lot about arms, haven't we? - Now everyone understands. - Good, don't worry, Baltos. We are all free, everyone decides for themselves. - There's no pressure on anyone. - OK. He said: What a caste enemy calls “terrorism”... is the beginning of the armed struggle of a whole people. And we were seeing the uprising of these peoples... in Latin America, in Africa. Just as today, we are seeing the blossoming of the Arab spring. A motley collection of arms. After all, we are internationalist! A Beretta. I think this one's right for you. Light and easy to use. Markus, this one will be the right one for you. No, I'll have this one. - Guy? What about you? - No, not for me. Charlie? Is that all right for you? That's fine. Go and stand over there in a row. All of you. Avoid pointing your firearms at the others, OK? You hold a firearm like this. Always nose to the ground. OK? - OK or not? - Yes, OK. Watch out! Left. Halt! Stop it, I'm here! Are you completely mad? Come here! Come here! You want to die? Come here at once! Stay here! Behind us! Ok? Is that all right or not? We're not ready yet! Where did that guy come from? Trust us, we know what we're doing. Now he's understood! And if he hasn't, we'll soon see that he does. The comrades must know if you are trustworthy. Why? Don't they trust anyone? Now, can we trust you? Sure! Very good. Capitalism is like a windscreen, if you hit it at the right place, it shatters. Do you really think so? Down there there's a blanket. Look! Unfold it! Do you recognize it? Yes, I think so. Well. We're there. Perfect. Now, give me the camera. Why? Don't ask any questions, do as I tell you. Pick up the firearm. Right. And what do you want me to do with it now? We said we wanted to test you. Now, this is the test. Can you see that villa? It belongs to the fascist State Councillor, Hans-Rudolph Widmer. In parliament he's the head of... the Argentinian-Swiss Alliance. Look at the gun. It's loaded. Now shoot three times at the façade. It's easy, the villa is empty. - No. - Don't worry. There's nobody there. Go on, I'm filming you. - Fire now, hurry up! - Wait. - Go on! Quick! - Yes, but wait. It's locked. Hurry up, dammit! Fire! Fire! Quick, dammit! Now you're really one of us. Can I come in? May I turn the music down? Well, are you now part of the group? Yes, I hope so. They say you put up a good show. I don't know if you could call it that. I think I'd rather be behind the camera, filming. What else would you like to know? To begin with... What's your aim? What are your demands? - Our demands? - Yes. Have you got time? Because this is going to take time. How long have you been together? We're not together, we screw together. Then you're for free love? Free love? That doesn't mean anything, free love. Love can't be free if the rest isn't. We want everything in society to be free. Work, dough, food, even the family. And how can society be changed? How? Watch out for the camera! Stop! In your opinion, how can we change society? Not with words, anyway. You can't change anything with words anymore. Society is deaf. All right? Not too heavy your gear? Oh yes, everything's OK. Go! Stay put! - Just listen! - Don't worry. So, stay where you are. Don't move, and keep your mouths shut! We want the car keys please! And the papers for all the vehicles here in the yard. Step on it! Is that everything? Now, Mister, be so kind... as to give my companions a conducted tour. Now we'll explain to these gentlemen, for whom they're really working! Do you know that your firm supports... Pinochet's dictatorship in Chile? That in Latin America... it works hand in hand with the C.I.A.? That makes one think, doesn't it? All this is not very pleasant! Wait, they don't understand you. Just turn off that fucking radio! Come on, guys, quick! Come on, Charlie, jump in! Let's have a look. I haven't seen this one before. There they are the little bastards. We didn’t have intimate conversations. We said: everything is political. And when I understood Virginie was pregnant... and Markus didn’t notice it, I kept repeating: a revolutionary’s duty is to create a revolution. Want to have a go? One afternoon Amalia, Baltos’s sister, came to see us with Carmen, a Chilean comrade from the MIR. Carmen was a cleaner in a bank in Zurich. Early one morning, before opening time, she had noticed a man speaking Spanish... handing over an attaché case full of bank notes... to the bank’s assistant manager. How can we know beforehand... on which date Vilas is coming? To catch him, I'd have to sleep with him. No, sorry. We don't do that. You won't have to do that. It's only, a little bit... It will be within the next three months. That's what he told me. Usually he phones me three days before. That's the time you will have to get things ready. You haven't much time to prepare yourselves. OK, I repeat, keep your distance, this bloke is a... Guy, from now on, everyone... minds his own business, OK? Calm down Amalia. We're all in the same boat, it's only normal for all of us to worry about Carmen. It's a bit late now, we should have thought about this before. What's that you're saying? Nothing. It's ok. It's the only way... of knowing which hotel he's staying in. I didn’t understand it all, but I had the impression... things were beginning to get serious. Who's this bloke with Carmen? A fucking fascist. On 20th March 1978, Guy told me to be prepared... to stay with them till the next day. Vilas was arriving that evening... and was to spend the night with Carmen. Operation Libertad had been set in motion. I was no longer an onlooker, I had become an actor, but without having rehearsed the play. Look at me. Do I look any different from usual? Yes, you really do. It's not the action itself that frightens me. Of course, the firearms, the violence, - when that's necessary - you don't do that with a light heart! But when faced with the repression... of which we're the victims, you have to have the courage. So, no, I am not afraid. I have the feeling I'm in the right place. Here's the hotel. Carmen and Vilas leave the hotel. And you will be here. I'll make a sketch. Vilas walks off. - Carmen walks along that way. - Yes. Vilas goes off. And you follow him. OK, the bank. We'll be here. With the car. Vilas comes. You're following him. And here. When Vilas gets here... You take out your Beretta... and you push him along. And at the same time... you and Charlie... both come over here, and you push Vilas and the manager inside. Guy and I come along behind, we stand Vilas over here, tie him up and all... Is Hugues coming with us? I don't know. In my opinion he ought to stay in the car. Oh no! He must come into the bank with us. We need him for the... We need him for the confession. Only for that. He'll stay in the car till the last minute, then we'll fetch him. I'd like to be there. Yes, in any case. But we'll see. OK, you'll be there, but you must keep your trap shut. - OK? - Yes. You mustn't say anything. We've one hour before the employees arrive. I think there are more important things. Alright. Let go of me. Has everyone chosen their arm? Everything OK, Charlie? Have we all got munitions? We've got everything. Have you got the cassettes? - Hugues? - What? Have you...? Have you got everything you need? Yes, I've got everything. Now it's the next on the left. Wake up! We'll soon be there. Markus! Scanner! Can you understand? - Markus, can you understand? - No. - That's German, isn't it? - That's not German. Everything ready? Go! It's here. Well, gentlemen, we're going to begin our little business. What's in your lovely suitcase? Well? I don't know. It's locked. Shit! Open it. Where's the key? Where is the key? Wait! Take it easy. Thank you. You'd think our friend was suddenly... afraid of the noise of the arms. Or he was trying to be discreet. How much has he got in his nice little attaché case. Wait, I'm counting. Count, count. - I'll deal with the décor. - OK, we'll leave it to you. How much is it? I don't know, but it's a lot. Good. Everything ready? Can we start? - Where are the placards? - Here. Can you help us? - Is he in it completely? - Yes, he's in it. - Perfect. - Show me. Is that alright? Where's the key to the safe? - What? - The key to your safe? - The desk, top drawer. - Thanks. Now let's film it. Go ahead! We're ready. Action! My name is Urs Amstutz. I'm vice-director of the SBS/SBV, Riesbach branch. For several years I've been in charge of receiving... the sums in cash that Mr Vilas deposited in our bank. How much? For several years several millions Swiss francs. How much exactly, my banker friend? 60 millions. - Does the managing director know? - Yes. I have to write a report each time. Of course. Do you know who Vilas is? And now it's your turn, errand boy. Fire ahead, who are you? Where does the dough you've got in your attaché case come from? I don't understand. Of course, where does... I've said, I don't understand. Where does the dough you have in this attaché case... and which you deposit in this fucking bank, come from? Where does it come from? I don't understand. But we know you speak French... Lieutenant-Colonel Zuccoli, Officer of the Secret Police. Aide-de-camp of the Nazi Stroessner. Where does the money come from? Who have you stolen the money from, so as to deposit it here. I don't understand. OK, cut. That's fine. Listen to me! You're telling the camera what we already know. Your name, what you do, who you work for. I don't know anything. Don't be an idiot. You'll regret it. You frighten me... Who is the chief of this fucking operation? Is it you? Of course it's you. Amateur! Do you think we'll let you off, you faggot? We'll find you. Then we'll make you eat your balls. And then we'll throw you to the dogs, and not only you, but your friends too. Comme cette salope de Carmen. Like that slut, Carmen. At least he speaks French. What's your name? Say "Zu-cco-lli". I'll help you. "Zu-cco-lli" Stop that. Not like that. Do you want your brains blown out? Stop, stop! It would be better for us if he said something. Eh toi, le barbu, And you, you beard, does the little slut suck your prick too? We'll talk about it later, you filthy swine. Who fucks you better, him or him? Shut your kisser. Or do you want more? You share everything, don't you? You and me, Nazis, understand each other, no? No! Leave it! Keep calm. We must keep calm. Shit on your mother! Don't you see he's manipulating you? And you're falling into the trap. What are we talking about here? What's all this about? Don't you meddle with this, faggot! This business is for real men. Just listen, you fascist swine. Now tell us who you are... and where you come from! Got it? Come here, shoot! Where does this money you've stolen... from your people, come from? Out with it! Now! Talk! Suck me, faggot! What? What did he say? Suck me, faggot! My arm! Shit, my arm! I think we've broken his arm. If he comes out alive, he'll return with colleagues, drills and pincers. And of course he'll find us: from Carmen to Amalia, from Amalia to me, then to all of you. - We can't kill him here. - Why not? Because then the operation will have been pointless. Ah yes? Let's all die, so that your operation makes sense. Wait. We have no option. We must take him with us. The employees will arrive in five minutes. We've got no hiding place. We'll find one. I've got an idea. But what else do you want? You want people to see... his smashed-up face in all the papers? The GAR is amusing itself and tortures a bloke in a bank? But I didn't do it on purpose. You know it was an accident. Call it what you like. But we can neither leave him here nor kill him. Ok? We should have thought of that... before we smashed his face up. You need a confession, do you? We're taking him with us. Quick! No, fuck! We don't care a shit about this fascist! Wait, calm down! I won't have anything to do with this! What? I won't have anything to do with a kidnapping. You, don't start! You film, that's all. OK? You are responsible for everything that'll happen... to us, and to the other comrades. Ok, let's take him with us. Quick Get the tapes from the security cameras! They're already arriving. OK. It's alright. We've about ten minutes' lead. Shit! Can someone see what's wrong with him. What does it matter if he dies. - We should really take him to a doctor. - Later. First we go to the community. And for the rest, let's keep to the plan. And as soon as the Nazi is better, we'll interrogate him again. He'll never talk. Never. We'll see about that! Whatever happens, we don't do anything... until we hear about the operation in the media. Then we confirm things by pushing the video off to the TV. We have the banker, and that's already something. Wait, first we must edit the video. What are you talking about? We must edit the video first of all. We can't publish it as it is now, we can't show everything. What? We need an editing table, and mine's in Geneva, you know that. One never gets bored with you lot. We'll find a solution. There always is one. It's OK? - Have you got the banners? - No. - What's in the bags, then? What could it be? But I said we wouldn't take the dough with us. Should I take it back to the bank? We haven't any more room. With him we're seven. We'll put him in the boot. No, there's material and guns there. Shit! If there's no room, we'll finish him off here. Give me your gun. Stop it, Charlie! - Don't film this. - Wait. Don't film this! If I understand, we'll kill the bloke, because there's no room in the car. As good a reason as any other. Put that gun down. I can see you. It's better this way. Otherwise you'd remember it the whole of your life. Perhaps now we could stop playing at Hollywood. Leave him. We must take the responsibility. We'll see what we make of him. What's here is for history. - We must go till the end of the show. - The show? - What's that you're saying? - Let me get out. Your show pisses me off. Stop the car! We stick together, you know that. Stop the car! Now! Listen. Calm down. We'll discuss it. OK, we'll discuss it later. All I want is to get out of this fucking car. Stop the fucking car! I've still got something to do in town. See you afterwards at Priska's. I know the way. Drive on, now. Drive on. Why's he doing this now? He's chained up, but he still remains dangerous. We must be careful. It'll be on the news this evening And tomorrow all the papers will be full of it. While we're waiting, I'll sleep a little. He'll be back. Don't worry. Nuclear energy: Switzerland commits itself... to take back its radioactive waste. USA: During his stay in Washington... Kurt Furgler signs an agreement... with the American authorities, to take measures against terrorism. Lebanon: UNO's French troops... enter the port of... Near Cherbourg the French have installed... a reprocessing plant for nuclear waste. A firm from the Hague which specialises in the upkeep... of Swiss nuclear power-stations. A new contract between... the firm COGEMA, responsible for... their equipment and the Swiss nuclear power-stations... One day, they'll explode. A contract, providing for the reprocessing of... radioactive fuel in the nuclear power station. The law to be instituted is no real progress. There must be a decrease... in the number of illegal abortions. This is the end of the news. Thank you for watching it. There will be another broadcast this evening at 22.40 The weather forecast follows. Have a good evening. It's too early. They haven't had time. We'll have to wait till tomorrow. We've stolen all the whites' weapons. Watch out, Vilas! You've only got a few more hours to live. Watch out! How are things, Hugues? What are you playing at? Cowboys and Indians. You're completely stoned. So are you. Are the others asleep? Yes, I think so. Fuck, what have you been up to? Nothing. I've done a round. A round? I've been waiting for you the whole night. Damm it, Markus, you're completely stoned. I knew it. Yes, I'm stoned, but everything's alright. Here. Here's the paper. Stop it. I don't like it when you're like that. Where's my room? - Keep calm, Mum. - Stop that! - Where's my room? - Look at the state you're in. I love you. Hand me a cigarette, please. Good morning. How's life? Hugues, everything OK? I'm cold. Aren't you cold? I don't understand. Because you still believe in the system. You think they respect their own rules, but they couldn't care less. Television, newspapers, banks, the lot! And they do what they like. I don't believe in the system. You idiot! I think I know the system. It should be on the first page of all the papers. Shit! Don't get worked up! We can't wait. We make the decisions, not them. But we do make the decisions! We've started the action. It's all a question of strategy. We hold the trumps in our hands. We don't hold anything in our hands except your stupid dreams of films. Since yesterday afternoon the 300 workers at... Technicair SA are jobless. Technicair SA, a company specialized in ventilation... and air conditioning is filing its petition. Still nothing? It is declaring itself bankrupt. For some time the firm has had financial difficulties, connected it seems, with the building trade. For its 300 employees, of which 160 in Geneva, and others in Lausanne, Sion, Lugano, Bern... I've never seen so much dough in my life. Go to bed. OK, Mama. Markus, if you could stop calling me Mama... Hey Guy? Get ready! The news are about to start. What shall we do with all this money? That's a good question. There are plenty of comrades who could do with it. And we'll need it too, if we go on with this. Do you want to go on with it? Markus, open up! Open! What's all this shit about? The door! What are you doing? We're fucking. That's obvious, isn't it? Stop making a fuss. Come and join us. Dammit, you're both totally stoned. No, Virginie, stop it! You make me sick. All this is totally stupid. You're better than that. Eat! You can still back out, it's not too late. You're wasting your time, Vilas. I know exactly what I'm doing. And why I'm doing it. Yes, I understand you. We all have our reasons. And for oneself, they're always the right ones. But I'm certain that you've other dreams. Revolution... doesn't last a life long. I must see a doctor. My arm hurts. I'll get you some water. Let me leave. Just leave the door open. We are going to look after you. What are you saying? He says we're going to look after you. In 10 minutes a car will come and fetch you. Amalia has found a new hiding place. Baltos, the prisoner and I will be the first to go. And the dough and the arms? Baltos and I will take half the money and the arms. You take the rest. We'll meet there. Vilas’s arm was swollen, he’d soon be no longer capable... of speaking of his dirty trafficking. - I'll accompany you to the car. - Yes. But at least we had the banker’s confession. We returned to Geneva, so I could edit the pictures. We took refuge in a decorator friend’s workshop. Guy and I spent the whole night... making our video of the banker’s confession. We’d left the tape with our contact at the TV, a journalist Guy and Virginie trusted. Do you want something to eat? No, thanks, I'm not hungry. This time the media had no choice, they would be obliged to speak of Operation Libertad. Cheers! Thanks. Do you want some? Yes, thanks. It hurts, Mama. Leave me alone. I'll untie you. Don't move. I don't want to. I don't want to, Mama. Leave your mother where she is. Dammit. You're raving, you bastard. - Mama! - I'm not your mother, arsehole! - I'll die. - Shut up! - I'll die. - Shut up! I must go to hospital. To hospital? And you? Would you take the bloke... whose fingernails you'd torn out, to hospital? - I'll die. - Be quiet. Keep calm. A doctor. I am the doctor. Trust me. Trust me. It's all alright. Helicopters, road blocks, at first the operations... had concentrated on Rome. Aldo Moro, it was suspected, could not be kept prisoner... very far from the place where he had been captured. Little by little, the zone for search spread wider. That wasn't a good sign. Today people talk about a kidnapping... near the Swiss border. The greatest search operation in all Italian history... continues 24 hours a day. The terrorists have definitely been identified, now comes the hardest step, how to localise them. The search has already been on since 16th March, the day of the murder in the Strada Fani. Never yet have the Red Brigade... who have been accused of... the responsibility for over 800 attacks... They are talked about. That's the most important. They make the headlines every day. They are talked about, but all the same they are in shit. You want to be on TV? You only have to shoot that shitty bastard behind there... and place his head on a seat in a Swiss bank. Then you'll be on TV, I can guarantee you that. We've a problem with the prisoner. He doesn't move. Shit. Wake up again, damn you. What's wrong with him? I don't know. His arm has swelled to twice its size. He's coming round. - I want more. I want... - What's he saying? He's saying he'd like more. More what? You haven't given him drugs, have you? You must be joking! You're completely nuts. He was in pain. He was delirious. What have you done? At least he's calm now. Of course he's calm. You son of a bitch! He was suffering. What was our action for? Perhaps he'll die of an overdose! For me, that's the problem. I'm a problem for you, aren't I? Yes, you are. Hey, calm down! Stop that! That's enough. Am I a problem for someone else? Fuck! Fuck! He called me the son of a bitch! It's me, Amalia, open up! OK, it's Amalia. What are you doing here? The police got hold of Carmen this morning. The police have arrested Carmen. The cops said she was illegally in Switzerland. They're sending her back to Chile. Her plane leaves in an hour or two. You can't stay here. It's too dangerous. You can't stay here. It's too dangerous. - Go home. - Certainly not. If I want to speak to you, I'll ring your phone, 15 minutes later, I'll phone you. Got it? Yes. Dammit. Wait you can't do that. We must discuss it. Do you want her to be arrested, too? Maybe it's not the cops. What are we going to do now? Now we're being chased by the police. But it could be private detectives from the bank. We're not in the media. Officially, nothing happened. You must wake up. Your theory with the TV doesn't work. Right. We'll discuss it, but later, OK? We must find a new hiding place, straightaway. I'm going to look for one. If I'm not back by seven in the morning, leave one after the other, every 20 minutes. Take the arms and the dough with you. The prisoner stays here. Is that clear? Wear normal clothes, take the tram, the bus, go on foot, but not in a car. We wondered if the sending of our tape had caused Carmen’s arrest. We all suspected it, but nobody voiced it. We said: the aim of an exemplary action is to be spectacular. But here, we simply didn’t exist. Vilas, Operation Libertad, the GAR, dissolved into the Helvetian system. Keep calm, Markus. Yes. We must contact other groups. Other groups need money. We can share it with them. I don't know. What shall we do now? It isn't easy. We must share out the dough now. We'll deposit Vilas... in front of the hospital and run for it. Share? Really? I'm sorry, but your idea is idiotic. If you've another suggestion, we'll be pleased to hear it. It's a bit late for suggestions. No, it's OK, we're discussing. Just take a look around! There's oppression everywhere. Two kilometres away, immigrant workers are living... next to the airport, in shacks, like prisoners, without their family, without rights, without anything. In Lisbon the suburbs are overflowing with Africans, slaves, who don't even have to be locked up, who are permanently exploited. And what are you doing? I suggest we amalgamate with an association... that is capable of doing something. The RAF, the Palestinians, the Red Brigades. Oh, we've had enough of your Red Brigades. Have you seen what shit they're sitting in now? Don't you see they're remote-controlled, manipulated by the Mafia? But no, you don't see anything! Your Red Brigades. - What do you know about it? - And you too? Look at us. If things go on like this, in two weeks we'll all be in prison. Or dead. We've no fear of dying. Yes, I know, it's a pity you haven't. Then you'd stop taking these shitty drugs. That's my business. Perhaps you're only jealous, because your kitty prefers bonking with me. What? D'you know what? I've no need to account for anything... to a bloke who steals cash from the revolutionary fund. What's that you're saying? Everybody knows. Tell me how you paid for the powder. That's my problem. And Charlie, who you're giving hell with this shit. I do what I like, I'm not your property. Yes, you're right. You're not my property. But what is my property is my share of the cash. I'm taking Vilas's share. The dough is not for me. You can be sure of that. You can't do that, Baltos! Who'll stop me? Virginie? Charlie? Markus? You? Well for me, it's all over. Fucking lot. Leave me alone. He's dead. Wait. That's not true. What do you want? And you? What do you want? That's the end. We've messed everything up. For some time now we've been fucking it up. You ought to go. It's your last chance. Get out! Go! Will you keep it? Thanks for everything, Hugues. Thanks. Thanks for your confidence. Now go. Where are you going? What's that bag? - We've nothing more to eat. - Show us. Stop it, Markus, not now. What have you got in that bag, Virginie? Stop it, Markus! Let her leave! Go, and come back soon. And buy something to drink. These are my last pictures. I too, just had to leave with my camera and my tapes. A week later, we heard... that hundreds of thousands of dollars... had been distributed... among the inhabitants of a Lisbon slum. I recognised Baltos’s signature. As for the rest of the money, Paraguayan comrades made good use of it, as was only right and proper. We’d decided to meet again... once everything had calmed down. We were afraid for a long time. And after that, we were no longer twenty. Leila, my daughter, by chance you were born here, you chose neither your parents nor Switzerland, nor the 21st century, but with these elements you can construct your history.
