Unfortunately, no one believed me the last time the Meru from the Cygnus-588 Galaxy invaded Earth. Their mission was simple. The workers arrived on Earth, that started to devour human bodies from the inside out collecting red and white blood cells for their Queen to consume. They wanted to bio terraform the planet so their Queen would produce offspring, which would dominate us all. I couldn't let that happen. Tell it to someone who cares. During the night of the falling stars, dozens of meteors pierce the atmosphere and fall on the Earth. These meteorites carry a a slime in which an alien organism laid dormant while they travel through time and space. After landing, these organisms awakened, and they feed their hunger. They hunger for red and white blood cells. They need biological matter, living human beings. This is Dewitt K. James. He's kind of my hero and I assure you, he's not crazy. That's me on the phone. Hi, I'm Brian. This is us, John, Emily, me. Man, I look badass. Stay together! Run! Ugh. Ouch, hurts every time. Uh, let me tell you how this all got started. Huh! That's John, professional wrestler. Could definitely kick my ass. - John, are you okay? Bad dream? - Yeah. Weird shit. - Told you we shouldn't eat that sushi so late. I was being chased by aliens. What does that have to do with sushi? So that reminds me of a joke. An alien invasion happens in Vegas, does it stay in Vegas? That's Emily. He's my girlfriend's sister. She could also kick my ass. Right here, running for my life and you cracking jokes. Your weirdo. Shut up. Come on, it was funny. Uh uh. Em, another fallen star. You make a wish. Don't forget, we're leaving right after your physical therapy. You forgot, didn't you? We're meeting Karen and Brian to go camping this weekend. - Oh yeah. Leave it up to Brian who want to go - damn camping. - He's a little eccentric. Eccentric is a nice word for crazy. I just hope that we survive your sister and Bill Nye the Science Guy. He's not that bad. I'm gonna get bored the hell out of your sister with all that science fiction fan boy crap. - But she's always been into fantasy. Her dad was really big in all that Lord of the Rings stuff. Well, might get a few hiking days in, build the knee up strong. Just make sure you protect me from all those wild animals. I'm going to wind up and take a Xanax or else I'll be up all night just waiting to be eaten alive. If you don't want to go, we ain't going. It's important to Carrie and I feel like we need this getaway too because if I have to create another art project from a fifth grader, who doesn't give a damn about art, I will scream. Just going to pretend like we're at a five-star hotel. Oh, look, another one. It's like the 20th one in the last three days. Maybe it's just 20 times a good luck for us to have a fun weekend. Are you gonna miss it? Not the physical toll, but guys, fans. Yeah, I'm gonna miss it. Guess I'll just have to entertain you then. New tonight, a light in the sky had many of you confused and maybe a bit concerned. In a matter of minutes, so many people. Karen, my girl. Yeah. How did I end up with a model? I mean that's the kind of shit that only happens in a movie. Hey, Brian. Did you pack my toothbrush? Thank you. I'm so happy. We're getting out into some nature. I haven't put my shoe on an exotic location for months. Okay. Well I'm glad to see you're excited too. I'm sorry baby. You know how I get when I read DeWitt. Okay, well this weekend means a lot to me I want John and Emily to get comfortable hanging out with you. - Hey me, too, right. It's why I suggested it. Look, this is going to be the perfect place for us to see the falling stars. - Come here. Come on. - Okay You know, growing up, I was always the geeky kid. You know, I was into Star Wars, Dune and that's what fueled me. When I look up at the sky, I don't just see the Big Dipper or some minor Sagittarius. You know, I see a sun that burned out millions of years ago. I see worlds waiting to be discovered, I see myths and legends and histories waiting to be told. It's why I got into the field to study. I'm in. - That's the romantic in you. I'm sure John and Emily will also appreciate your passion. Yeah. And if they don't, I got a bunch of sweet rounds that John and I can test out. Wooha! Well, I hope you boys are not planning to be shooting all weekend. Hey, we're gonna bond. All right, trust me. And this is gonna give you some good time to hang out with Emily. Okay. Well, I hope you have some time left over for me. We never get to hang out. I know this thesis, it's killing me, all right? But, hey, I'm gonna get tenure maybe and that's gonna be good for both of us. Yeah, I can't wait. I love you. I love you too. Baby, let's get to the good part. We did it, oh my god! We did it! Oh shut up girl! I'm sure his family has life insurance. His family will benefit from his death. Like, do you see this? We are rich, bitch! Oh my god! Like, the way the security guards head exploded, I mean it was like pow, bang! This shit is crazy! - It's like that Batman TV Show. - Right? Yeah? Well I did it to save your skinny ass. No, you did it so we can get this. - Bitch! - Hey, hey, you two calm down, okay, we got to get off of this main road. I lost my mother too far from here. They'll never bother us out there. - You okay, back there? - She'll be okay. These are the choices that we made. You sure it's safe here? Mitch, career, criminal, but at the moment he's pulling down two chicks at the same time. So, I don't know maybe I need to rethink my career. - Of course its bone fuck China. I wanna get out of these fucking clothes. - Get your eyes off that trash. - Can we just stay focused? Maybe get us out of this mess? Hey baby girl, - Did you see that? - Who is this crackhead? My cousin Earl. - Hey Earl. - They've been following the whole day. I don't have a clue what that is. - Wait, cous. Cous, wait. - What's going on? - Earl! - Earl, wait. - Like, cous, what are you doing? Earl, We gotta stay here, okay? What the hell is that green shit? Smells like ammonia. Hey, hey, hey. Don't touch that shit. Does have that ammonia smell. I'll bet it's outer space gold. Feels like maple syrup to throw on my pancakes. This is weird. I don't like it. Look Earl, as much as we'd like to have an earth science class out here we need to lay low. I heard the police scanner. You guys are famous. Bad shit about security guard, though. What you gonna give up for my Em? Blackmailing us? You two set this up. - No we gotta lay low and this place is as good - as any. - It is safe, but there's a price. This is cousin Earl. He's got a doctorate in philosophy. Yeah, he's, he's definitely on something. We're not gonna short, you dipshit. Tell you what, you help us out, and we will reward you. We'll use your police scanner. I'll charge you for the scanner. Crazy times. You guys are wanted, first-degree murder and this green she's fallen from the sky. Look, we should be here for a day or two, okay? We not gonna be any trouble. Can't say that for that mad, cow virus bullshit. Yeah, this lime is gonna make me rich. I'm gonna test this nasty guy, I'm gonna call it Earl goo. We don't have time for this trash. I'm gonna watch what move the cops are making, anticipate, react? Okay? - I'm gonna change. Are we cool? - Yeah. Yeah, my place is yours. I can't believe this! I'm going to be an auntie! - I know. - Uhm, how you gonna tell him? - Girl I don't know. I just don't want him to freak out. He doesn't like change, so, I'm sure that, Let me see the picture again. Okay. Ah! Yes. Yes. He got your head - Shut up! It could be a she. As if we need any more females in this family. - Yeah, you're right. I mean I'm not just empower women but I feel like what we've been missing is a strong man. Mom was amazing. She's still amazing. Yeah, she kills it, but, I mean me growing up with you was great. I loved it. We're best friends, but I just miss having my dad around and I know you missed yours too. So, John is proud and loyal and he's such a family man. But I just wish that he could. Commit to a life with a baby, a mommy and a daddy. Don't be so hard on him. - John is not your dad. - I know. Now, if Brian could just get his head out of his books, - Girl, baby mommas together! Could you even imagine? That would be so fun. That would be dope. So, are you ready to do this? Brian suggested, a nice little spot where his uncle used to take him. Yeah, I know. He sent me all the videos. It should be fun, for camping. Man, I got some sweet rounds that we could test out. You know, I could be Arnold from Commando and you could be, uh you know, my sidekick, Danny Devito from twins. Oh, please someone's going to be Arnold, it's gonna be me. I'll be back. - That's a horrible Arnold. Listen, I got to work on it, all right. - This is gonna be a fun weekend. - Great. - What happened to you? - There's something that bit me! What? Bit you? I told you they're coming. Oh, Cous, that looks bad. What was it? Was it a cop? What? Where'd they go? It wasn't human. And it blew up! It wasn't human? And it blew up. What was it, a rabid dog? Maybe a bear? No, it looked like something out of Star Trek Voyager. Who in the fuck knows anything about Star Trek Voyager? First, you bring us here, and this guy wants to cut and now he comes back. Seeing that something supposedly bit him and then blew up. Earl is solid. I have no idea what just bit him, but whatever it is, it doesn't look good. He needs to go to the hospital. Oh, welcome to Crazy Town something supposedly bit him and then blew up. What the actual fuck? Yeah, Renee, what the actual fuck? Very cute trailer park trash. But what's up with casting? It's true, man. Pinkie swear We have people after us. I'm not risking my ass for some crackhead. No offense, Earl, It is what it is. I'll take care of my cousin and once he's okay, I'll come back. - Bitch, you ain't gonna go nowhere. - Nobody is going nowhere. Vet's my cousin. We all stick together. I drop a hundred, she ain't saying shit. Okay, but the money stays. I'm not leaving the money. You don't need the money at the vet. This shit hurt. Bad. Fine. I'll be right back. Let's go. Detective Moran, here in pursuit of a 1/32, from First National Bank. We're headed north towards Tender's Bridge Mountain. [car engine stopping} [{music] Detective Mark Alston. The toughest guy in the world according to him. No, he's not compensating for anything. Where's your badge, rookie? Uh, Lulu ate it. And Detective Moran. Cute, spunky, tough. I think she likes me. Really? Okay. On me. As soon as we can, we're gonna ditch her and take the money, okay? Shhh. Little pig, little pig. I'm right over here. I'm about to put a bullet in your chiny, chin, chin. - Drop it. I'll shoot. - So am I, now give me that. You actually let them take your weapon, rookie. Guess you taught me well. Yipee ka yay, motherfucker Okay. Let's see. Wait. Didn't we pass this like an hour ago? I know it's around here somewhere. You know this is where I met Dewitt K. James. The science fiction writer? Brian's a little fanboy. You can't be a fanboy when it's an author, okay? You know I study, and I appreciate his work, you know and my uncle knew him. Your uncle knows the author? Wasn't this the one that got committed? - Brian loves crazy. - Okay, all right. That was a government cover-up. Okay. He said he stopped an alien invasion by himself. I would love to have Brian committed. - Okay. Maybe we get to have him throw his special. Yes. Alright, you all make as much fun as you want, but he is a great, great man. The government knows it and they just covered it up. He should have had a medal. Hey, why don't we ask them. Hey, hey, we're lost. No, I have an emergency. We're looking for Penner's Reed Mountain Campsite? I'm not from up here. Move, Bitch! Fuck you! - What did they say? - Nothing. The dude on the back is bleeding, and holding his arm. Shit. Is she okay? Where's the man? What man? There was a man in the backseat! The one with the bloody bandage. Okay, c'mon, c'mon, let's get out of here. C'mon. - Gotta go, Let's go, let's go! I caution you, be wary. Your friends, your family could lay host to these parasites. They want to infect, feed, and populate. Show no hesitation in killing them. They will come after you. Enough, Brian! Look, we gotta get Karen to the hospital. I'm sorry that you don't want to hear the truth. - What are you doing, man? - Son of a bitch! John, stop it! The fuck, man! You knew the meteors might be dangerous the entire time. It was more fantasy than reality, man. But you knew of the possibility. Yeah, It could be possible. Give me one reason why I don't kill you right here. One, It's true. So, if we all gonna die, it doesn't matter if I kill you now, right? Jesus, are you crazy? Forget him! We gotta get Karen to safety now! We just gotta find the closest hospital. Baby, you're gonna be okay, Alright, I promise. - It hurts really bad. - I know. I know. All right we're gonna get you some help with soon as we can, okay? - Ryan and his little videos are freaking me out. What if he's right? And she's gonna turn. What do you mean turn? When an alien bites you? All right. The open wound of the victim, it releases blood in a wave, right, but with the throbbing of the host, it releases parasitic symbiosis cells or and then that's when the infection and the transformation begins. - Are you serious? I don't care about all of your fancy scientific terms. What the fuck is wrong with Karen? She's not gonna be her anymore. She's gonna be something else. All right? And look, I bought into Dewitt's world, Okay, It was it was a good story, it was like Star Wars but you know it wasn't real. Everything he said is coming true now, all right, if we have any chance of saving Karen, we need to find him. - Is that why we are here? He's the only one that's dealt with this before. All right, if we have any chance of saving our planet, we need to find DeWitt. - No shit. - I just want to save my sister. And I'm not into planet-saving business, I'm trying to save me and my wife's ass. You don't wanna save your sister-in-law's ass? Hey, you all see that? It's a cabin. Maybe they can help. Well, maybe the cabin has got a landline or something. Yeah, well these woods aren't safe. No shit, Jimmy Neutron. - Honey, I'm sorry. - Hey! don't honey her! Let's get to the cabin and we'll phone for help. - Who the fuck are they? - Fucking Amazon Prime. How the fuck would I know? Hide the money. - You think they're cops? - No. They're not in gun mode. And one of them looks hurt. Yeah, I got 'em. Hey, don't freak out. We have an emergency. We need some help. Anybody? - Don't you fucking move! - Don't shoot! - We need help for my sister. - You're not cops? Fuck the police. Straight from the underground. Please help us. She's hurt. Do you mind not pointing that at me? Can I use your phone? - No. - Where's your bathroom? - You okay? Emily. Wait. These are friends of yours? What the hell? I should've brought my camera crew. Such a silly ass. Who are they? What are they? Aliens. - Is everything okay? - Yeah. Are you okay, sweetie? I wanna go home, take me home. I know, sweetie, we'll get you home. Uh, what do they want? Us. To eat. - Look. - Shit run! Run! They're gonna eat your ass, Run! - They're coming this way. - What should we do? You got guns, right? Aim for their heads! Hold up! Save your ammo! Save it! Fuck, I'm out. What the hell? You guys wasted like a hundred bullets. Y'all didn't play Duck Hunt when you were kids. Well now we know. Now we know what? Where not to shoot. - We should cover the windows. - These things have to be stopped. We need to get Karen to a doctor. What's wrong with her? - She got bit by one of those things. - She's cold. She's hurt. - Do you guys have a car? - Sorry, we don't. So, um, why that thing eat us again? They need to be nourished? All right, and they're parasites and they devour the body from the inside out. They're changing the blood cells while they prepare them for their Queen while bio terraforming the planet. - Bio transformable? - Bio terraforming. It's, they're changing us. People, humans into food. So, like jack in the box? Up to the planet Earth and order some human flesh to go? Kind of yeah. They stay here and they turn us all into Jumbo Jets. - Shut up, Brian. Hey cool it with the sci-fi mumbo-jumbo, okay? and let's help Karen. Is she gonna turn like the others? Cause if she is she needs to be out there with those monsters. Not in here She's my sister. - I understand that, but if she's going to turn into one of them, she needs to be out there with the rest of these monsters not in here with us. I'm not sending my sister out there to die. Sister looks pretty fucking dead to me, lady. Hey you need to shut the fuck up too. Guys, hello. Bigger issues here! Hey look, just find a safe place to secure her and then we can figure this - out. - John, help her. Baby, I want to. But I don't know how we can help. Let's set her in the bedroom, right? We can barricade it from the Let's set her in the bedroom, right? We can barricade it from the outside, no, no the bathroom is actually going to be occupied. Outside, no, no the bathroom is actually going to be occupied. Yeah. Let's put her in the bathroom. I'm not locking her up all alone. Em, if it's only a human bite thing, Karen will be fine in the bathroom. But if she does turn into an alien, she's gonna attack us. I really hate you, Brian. C'mon baby, it's, it's the best plan. And If it's only a bite, she'll be fine. - Where are those guns? - They're outside in the car. Lot of good they do out there genius. Well I didn't know we're gonna barricade ourselves inside the cabin. We don't need the guns. We just have to get to the car and bail. - True. The reason for any of us being here, as well is it? Well we still have to survive getting to the car. Why haven't they forced themselves inside? They're higher brain functions are curved for primal instinct. They know what they need to do, but they just don't know the logical steps to get them. They can't open windows or doors. Yeah. All this knowledge brain so do I use it to get us out of here. Shut the fuck up. Emily asked me a question and I answered it. Here's a question for you. Who's the biggest douchebag here? Me? Alright. Stop it. - You got signal? - No, no, no. This is a download for info about them. Take a look at this. I caution you, be wary. Your friends, your family could lay host to these parasites, that want to infect, feed, and populate. Show no hesitation in killing them. They will come after you. Who the fuck is this? He's basically the Zachary Sitchin of extraterrestrial history. He lives around here. Zachary who? Zachary Sitchin? He's the author, he proposed the theory that ancient astronauts created human beings. The Anunnaki. Great. More Science fiction shit from Brian. So you're saying that these aliens are here to grow more aliens, can you give us some kind of hope to hang on to? Hope? They are here to wipe us off the planet. I mean this mountain, this is Ground Zero. Alright, we need to find a way because I mean, he's the expert here. - Well, unless Dewitt has a nuclear bomb. I don't see how he can help us. Maybe he does. All of these books did Dewitt mention how he killed them? Kill shots to the head, the heart. Explosions, decapitations. I mean, they're, they're strong and they're sturdy, but the hosts can still die. I mean, they're using human bodies. Again, all of our damn guns and the car and Bonnie and Clyde over here, wasted enough ammo earlier to clear out a street corner. There's also the alien queen, I mean, she's gonna be a lot harder to kill. Alien queen. Great. More good news. How do we kill the queen? We're gonna need a lot more firepower. And this. - Hey, man! Why are you walking around with a grenade in your Cosby sweater? Look, I thought we could have some fun and blow some shit up. Your mental. You've been driving in a car with a live grenade in your pocket? - Two, actually. Just need one of them to blow up the queen. Hey! Yo we gotta use this for the queen. Oh my god, Karen! No don't open the door! - Don't open the door! - She's my sister! Brian, move or I'll move you. Don't do this! She'll kill us! We need to figure out a way out of this shithole. You gotta keep your quiet, man. It's okay. Karen, I'm coming! Shit! Nooooo! Get off me! Fuck! Help! Please! Get off me! Get off! Let me out! Fuck! - We gotta turn on all the lights. - Why? - Just wait. - Why did that work? - Light sensitivity. How would these supposedly advanced creatures light sensitive? Achromatopsia. It's through heightened vibrations in the inner ear that the alien organism is able to increase the ability of the hosts hearing, all right? But it also gives a rapid reaction to the retinas, they can see on different spectrums like thermal or a negative light, but achromatopsia also causes cellular degradation. It affects, the corneas and the retinas, which is affected by light, hence, light sensitivity. We shouldn't be here. Karen would still be alive. It's your fault. Renee is dead because of you, motherfucker! I should fucking kill you! Hey, hey. I'm sorry about Renee, okay, but these things are thriving and surviving, they are using Karen's voice to trick us and we need to outsmart them. Hear that noise? That's not coming from the bathroom. Back door? It's probably nothing. Don't open that door. Are there aliens in the house? But - why do you know who's in there? - Two cops. Why are there two cops in the bedroom? - It is what it is. Maybe they can help us. Hey, you guys okay? Get that fuck out of my face! Hey! he's not going anywhere! Yeah, we got a much bigger pressing situation outside, alright? So, calm down. Wait, where are our weapons and our clothes? Nice boxers. Everybody, hey! Just calm the hell down, alright. Listen, There is a more pressing situation than some cop and robbers - bullshit. - What's the situation? - We're surrounded by aliens. We just saw a woman get eaten alive and my sister-in-law and his accomplice are dead in the bathroom. Aliens? What the fuck are you guys smoking? - It's true. All right. They've arrived and they aren't the ET kind of the fucking Independence Day kind. Okay, so who are you guys? What do you have to do with him? I'm John, this is my wife Emily, and this is Brian, okay, we came up here to go camping and my wife's sister, Karen got bit by something. All right, he and his girl waiting here. When we came up in the cabin for help. - I got a radio at the car. I gotta call for backup. You watch him. Don't let him fucking move. That is not a good idea. Why - not? - Come here. Shh. Yeah, we're not prepared for this. You think? Shit. Brian says this Dewitt K. James knows how to exterminate them but I don't know how we can make our escape without having to fight all of them. Let's get to our next move here. Put some clothes on first? You happy now? Can we talk about how we get the fuck out of here? - Okay, where's your car? - Down on the road, 200 meters? Okay, we need to go get the guns and then we need to make it to your car for the radio. No. I would show it. I'm going to make all the decisions for here right now. We know more about what we're fighting out there than you so no, you're not in charge. Alright. Listen, I've been in the force for 25 years. I teach special weapons and tactics. I'm in charge. Hey, this isn't a pissing contest. Let the cop run things. He fucks up, let just throw him out to the aliens. Oh you're killing a cop now, lady? Give it a break, Austin. Shut up, Moran. You heard her, I'm in charge. I'd behave If I were you. One more thing. You, Hill Billy, you're under arrest. Are you serious right now? - Yeah, I am. - I'm not gonna fight. No. We need all the manpower we got. - Detective, he's right. After what we've seen. It's just not worth it. You know much about me now, hmm? Hey, Not cool. The queen. Fuck this bitch, seriously. What the hell was that? It sounds like a lot of them. We don't want them to know we're in here. - No! - Turn the lights on! - It temporarily blinds them. We gotta keep the lights on. How do you know that, huh? Because I had studied Dewitt's writings alright? He's the only one that's beat them. Jesus Christ, detective! Can you listen to other people for once? Dammit, the fuse. - You happy now? - I actually am. Ah shit! What was that? Why don't you go out and see? - Why don't you go huh? - Stop it. This alien situation. I think far supersedes our prior case. You fucking touch me again, I'll kill you. Aw, c'mon. Everybody calm the fuck down! The enemy is outside, comprende? We still got to get the guns. When we get to your car, I'll confiscate the weapons. Jeez, Inspector Gadget, why don't you just chill? All right, they know that we're in here, we need to get these lights back on. We need to find a fuse box. It's out back. I saw lines running out to the shed, but if we're gonna go out there, we need to stop by the car also. Look, if we, if we get the lights on, it'll draw them back to the woods, okay? And then we have time to get to the car. Alright. I used to do construction when I was young, so I'll go and John, I trust you. You're one of the good ones. And guess what? Hill Billy you're gonna be our tour guide yeehaw. Hon, look at me. Be careful and come back. - Watch Brian. Make sure he let's us back inside. Ready? Shit. Damn, it's dead. Let me try. How do you know so much about these things? My uncle is friends with Dewitt K. James. He's the one who fought these things the last time they came around. He wrote a bunch of books about them. I've read them all. There's a bunch of books about all this? Well, you can see, nobody takes it seriously, so, who reads them? I mean, was there a police presence the last time these things were here? Do you really think a cop like your partner would have believed this shit? Well, first of all, my partner's, a fucking prick and even I don't like that. This Dewitt guy, did he report to the authorities about the last invasion? Yeah, I mean he tried to get the info out but the government took them as seriously as any other conspiracy theory now. We need to be proactive about this to save lives. I swear, if I get out of this, I'm telling everyone I know. We need to prepare people to fight. - Yeah, we gotta fight for our right. Don't do it, Brian. To party. Yeah it's dead. Let's get back to the cabin. Shit. Keys C'mon. What happened? Fusebox is shattered. And I left the keys - Where are the keys? - Shit, I think Karen has them. - You let Karen hold the keys? - Don't start with me, Brian. Karen, who's Karen? She in the bathroom? Yes. They've been stalking us like that ever since you guys left. - What are they waiting on? The queen controls their movements telepathically. They might be waiting for orders. If we don't get out of here sooner or later they're going to get in here. I need to get the keys. How do you expect to do that? What are you doing? Shit. - John, John, what are you doing? - I'm gonna get those damn keys. What are you gonna do with those? I'm gonna clean your sister. On three, you open the door. And then what? I'm gonna get the fucking keys. Let's do it. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Are we sure we - checked the right fuse box? - What? My dad was an electrician and I'm pretty sure this place had renovations and I saw an electric box in the bed in the bedroom, bedroom. Let me just take a look, first. Oh, thank God. On three. Baby, you can do this. One, two, three. Game over. Wait, wait, wait Open that door. What the hell, Emily? She's my sister. She's no longer your sister. She's still my sister, John! Okay, okay, okay. He got bit. He's going to turn. Thank you, Dr. Einstein He saved my life. He's a murdering piece of shit. He deserves a trip to hell. Let's just get him outside. Okay. You got the flashlight. Come on. We'll go back door. Scare those fuckers off. She's gone. Alright. We got the keys. The guns are in the trunk, but we need a diversion while two of us go to the car. Fuck that. I'm not going again. Fuck it. I'll do it. What are you planning on? I don't know. I'll open the. Yeah. Well you better figure something quick because there are more of them coming Wait, how many flashlights do we have? Four in total. All right, we're all set. Okay. Austin, you're gonna open up the back door. If it's safe, I'll run out there and draw them away from the car. Make sure you guys have the right keys. I got the right keys. How do you know the diversions are gonna be big enough? It will be. Your funeral. Are you ready? Wider. On them. You want that. Open this fucking door, you bitch! Let me in Open it. Let's go. Go! I'll cover you. Shit! It's tripped to start. I though you said it wouldn't even be smart enough to open doors. Yeah, well it must be the queen. Guys, hurry up! Move! God, John, Let's go! Go! Let me get back to the cabin Go, go, go, go! Come on, hurry up, I'm coming! Hurry up! Fucking asshole! Oh my God, they're coming! Open up, you piece of shit! Austin! Open up the door! Fuck. She's fucking history, man. Why did you do that? Fucking bitch kicked me out the back door. Left me to die. You're an asshole Oh yeah. Fuck her. Should have switched partners right away. Man, you must have little dick syndrome, you killed her. You want some of it now? No, you want some of me? Oh I'm impressed. Alright. Enough, okay? He's a prick, we get it. But there's only four of us left. Like him or hate him, we all need to fight together. You're a prick too. Alright. Fine. And if we have the luxury of getting out of here, you can hate me as much as you want after that. You're not that important, dude, trust me. Fine. Okay, but good news, you got the guns. All right, bad news is the queen knows how to disable the cars, and if we can get the fuck out of here. We'll just hope that the cops are still functional. It should be, we hit it off the road. Can I talk to you for a minute? Yeah. What's wrong? When are you going to tell me about this? This weekend. We already talked about this, Em. We aren't ready. I'm wrestling again. You're working a lot. We did talk, but that didn't stop you from getting me pregnant. Look, John, life doesn't stop just because you're not ready. I guess we're doing this. Well, daddy better get mommy and baby out of this mess alive. Well, damn. Now I feel even more responsibility. We gotta make it out of here. All of us. Our family. I like that. Because if you can't, momma's gonna get me and our baby home. Don't look at momma My wife is pregnant. Congrats. - Hope that doesn't slow us down getting to the car. You really can't help being a prick here? Look, I'm happy for you. Okay, I'll send fucking flowers. But we still have to get to the car and I don't want anyone slowing us down, I better get there faster than you. Look, can we all just work together and get the fuck out of here? Alright. - I'm sorry. Okay. I mean it. - Alright. Let's do this. Okay. Let's go get Alright. Now the Queen's active. Okay, it's a hive mentality and she's given out a directive and it's not go eat. It's go eat those losers in the cabin. - Damn, she - called us, losers. - That bitch. Look if we focused on killing the Queen, the others will lose direction and motivation, it will be a lot easier to kill them after that. So, how do we know which one is the queen? I don't know. Oh shit! Okay, where is everybody? What the hell just happened? I just put six holes in that bitch and she had dropped. Oh shit. What? They're Gone. That's good. John Wick over here. He just put six shots in her chest and she didn't die. All it did was make her upset and now she's out there gathering up her workers and she knows exactly where to find us. No, maybe you should have told me that before I shot her six times. He had to, because she was going to come in and eat all of us. And I know it's damned if we do, damned if we don't. Okay, look, they're still gone. While she's regrouping or Whatever she's doing, we need to make a run for it. Where are the keys? Okay. Let's get back to the city. What is the aliens are in the city? Okay, smart guy, do you have a better suggestion? No. - Alright, I'll take my chances in the city. I'll take the bag. Do we have enough bullets? It doesn't matter. All right, if we focus on killing the Queen, the others will dissipate. If we get back to the city, we don't have to worry about killing the queen again. If we can get this car to start. I love you. I love you too. Get us out of this mess alive. - I will. - You better or I'll beat that ass. Are you guys ready? Bitch, you just need a break. We're sitting ducks out here, man. Okay look, we can either go back to the cabin or to town. We can't outrun them to town, and we can't go back to the cabin. It's compromised, the queen will return. What is your plan? We gotta kill the queen. Welcome to the party, pal. Who the fuck are you? This is Dewitt K. James. Hope I'm Brian Wilmack. My uncle was Doug Wilmack. Your uncle was a fine man. We lost him in the last invasion. I hate to interrupt this little family being here. How the hell do you get out of Dodge? We don't. All the roads in and out of here were blocked. My malicious attempting to get here on foot. How far they do it for them. Have no idea. All the radio contact is down. We need to find a landing spot. Have any of you seen green slime? What? The queen likes to Nest near the landing spot. We find the slime, we find the queen. And then what? We kill the Queen, the workers won't survive. This sucks on the contribution. Of all the stuff we're seeing tonight, this is the one thing that you decide not to believe. Do you know where the nest is? Normally, deeper into the woods. I got a Grenade. So do I. Okay. That's good. If we're close enough. That'll do it. Close is only good with horseshoes and shut up Brian. This is not a plan, right? And I'm not listening to this whack job. I'm out. Where the hell are you going, man? I'm going home. Good luck with that. Hey, we're stronger together. Oh shit. Why are we stopping? We got to keep moving. We become easier targets if we don't move. Come on. Are you hurt? If you're not hurt, we got to keep moving. God. Damn it. John. I'm fine. I've seen this place in a dream. The nightmare you had. Yeah. I dreamed I was attacked in this location by the alien and a voice said in my dream. Go to the room. The aliens are at the road. Yeah, we need to go back, we don't have enough Firepower to go into the lions den. Okay, I've got, I've got plenty of ammo. In my cabin, follow me, just follow me. Oh shit! Oh my God, Brian. Are you okay? No, but physically, yes. - Okay. Come on, we gotta move. - Okay. Hey, hey, stop. Please stop. What the fuck happened to y'all? We don't got time to explain. We should get out of here. I saw you earlier, you're the lady that crashed your car. I was looking for my cousin Earl I can't find him. I'm sorry, he's dead Everyone, they're all dead. - Who's all that? - Everyone. I don't know. You should go! go! I think we should go left. What's ever left in the gun. They're taking him over the mountain. - You're right. - Dewitt said they had the roads blocked. In and out. I don't know how we're going to make it back to the city. Wait, fuck, stop! I see something green. Like the green slime? Yeah. So we so we can look at it. Yes, this gracious, how we gotta get out of this mess. Yeah. The only way. Fuck it, I'm in. Okay, so we got to get this, right? Yes, Okay. Follow me. This is it? Yeah. Was this, you know that for sure. What are they waiting for? I can't do this. All of this is fucking weird, you guys are fucking weird all this is just fucking crazy. Hey, stop. Just stop! Emily. Are you okay? Yeah. The baby? Okay. Is it over? The queen is gone for sure, I'm sure. Come on. I change my answer. I definitely need to be around for you and our baby. Tell, that's the whole shebang. Here's some wise words from Dwight K James. "I told the world about the invasion, so the next time they arrived we'd be ready or else. When you fight aliens without a gun. What you want to do is go for the head and you wanna get that little alien brain. So what you want to do is use your elbows, knees. Whatever you want, throw kicks, huh? Just get them before they get you.
