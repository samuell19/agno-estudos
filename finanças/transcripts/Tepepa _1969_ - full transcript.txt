Neither of them carried a rifle. All were unarmed. Was that already... It was a kind of target shooting. Just the thing for our recruits. They were paralyzed with fright . From a distance they all looked the same. Only Tepepa... stood out. Like a mad eagle in the midst of scarecrows. I had given the order not to shoot him... ... because I wanted him alive. But he didn't know that. Yet he marched on, shouting: Cascorro, I'll kill you! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! Paco. He is dead. Excuse me. American? No. Englander.

Do you agree, Sefior? Do you know what they call me, Sefor? +The Louse". 'The Louse'. Because I can't wash myself. I can't even scratch myself! Do you understand? Do you like Mexico? constable! constable! constable! There is no message. The British Embassy has not responded. I can't stay here any longer. Put me in another cell! There is no other cell, Sefior.

Good day doctor. Have you left your wife yet? He has? The doctor is English. An important man. He wants to kill me, right? Du Hurensohn. That's enough. I said enough! What shoud that? Hiibsch, was? Should I kill him, Tepepa? No. The Doctor's just way too sentimental a guy. And you? Even so, I can be useful to you. Don't send us away, compafiero. All right then. We'll get a few hands together. Who was that? Who... Who was that? Those Rurales. Those Rurales. Because he was a friend of Tepepa. My god, my god. What cruelty... What cruelty. To destroy these fair hands , white and tender... No no no... What is wrong with our country? Welch ungliickseliges Land. What a sad, unhappy and poor country Mexico is. Of all those I know, only two could... Only two could write. One can no longer do it because he has no more hands. And the other is dead. What a shame for Mexico, Compafieros. A country where only the rich... ...the priests and the generals can write. And we will never know what they write as we are not able to read anything. We're a bunch of uneducated people. We're a bunch of uneducated people, but... ... but... Let's go, muchachos! Write. On! I give you the gun and you write. Then you might kill me. Mr. Exzellenz Madero... Your Excellency Madero... No, no, no. Give it, give it. Mr Wood... No no. Mr Wood... President Madero... Comrade Madero... Comrade Madero! Comrade Madero... Do you remember... ... at the 23. June... ... 1909? In the house in Cuzco... ... in which you hide... ... and waited for a man. Jesus... José... Moran. Jesus Jose Moran. That was my father. In that house... ...in that house... ...that was mine. Compafiero ... Remember how my dad brought you a message from Pancho Villa? The Rurales had shot him on the way. My father brought you the news... ... and was already dying. Calm down, dad. - For Madero. - Yes, father. Mr Madero? Mr Madero? Mr Wood... The Rurales wounded my father. - Where's Madero? - He is here. Stay calm. Where is he? He is writing a letter. Stay calm. - Young man. - He's calling you. go. yes father - Do you know where he went? - Yes, Sefor. And would you find your way there too? Yes, Sefior. Then go. A lot depends on you. Calm down, father... Take it easy... Take it easy... Take it easy... Take it easy... Now you have to go. Do you remember how hurried you were, companero? You said: 'The revolution will not wait. She doesn't wait." And you didn't let me see my father die. Let's continue, doctor. Do you remember Madero... ... at the 30. September... .. 19117 We had won. Tepepa, what are you doing? Mr President ... Do you remember me? Jesus Maria Moran... aka Tepepa. country and freedom. Do you remember? You do not remember? Anyway, Mr President. I took this rifle from the army to fight against the army. Now I have to give it back to the army. Who won, the revolution or the army? The revolution. - And the army? - The army serves the state. And we now have control of the state. The State? The organization of all citizens. - Rich and poor? - Rich and poor. Then we did something wrong, Président. Because everything has stayed the same. No. The rich will be less rich and the poor less poor. And how will that work? Thanks to the new laws that will make the army obey. The same army we fought? And. That one? And. Look, Sefor Madero... ... I trust you when you say these things. But it's hard for me to believe what you say. Gentlemen... I think this is a good opportunity if you tell us what you think. Or General? A general does not think, Mr. President. He obeys. And he obeys neither the rich nor the poor. He obeys the fatherland. Do you see? You said 'state' and he 'fatherland'. Ask him if the poor are also allowed to be part of the fatherland. My apologies, Mr President. There are many things I don't understand. Excuse me. It's a real shame because it's a very nice gun. I want you to take it If one day we need it again, you give it back to me. Agreed, but everything will be fine. You'll see. God willing, Sefior. It's lebe Madero! - It's lebe Madero! - It's lebe Madero! - Land and freedom! - Land and freedom! But it didn't all turn out well, Compafiero Madero. You can't remember because you weren't there that day. And nobody will have told you. But I... was there. I worked on the hacienda that before the revolution... belonged to Don Calixto. During the revolution it belonged to the peons. And now that the revolution is over, Don Calixto owns it again. You'll be happy to have Don Calixto back. He has returned from Europe. You don't seem happy. I'm sorry, but he's still back. Naturally he takes possession of his house again. His country too. Everything. - Is that clear? - No, senor. And who are you? Jesus Maria Moran, aka Tepepa. country and freedom. Nice name, my boy. What is this - land and freedom" all about? Take the land from rightful owners? Ask the President what it's all about. No way. I'm not as rude as you. We all have to obey the law, don't you agree? - Don't you agree? - No, Sefor, no. And why not? Well, first of all, because we made a revolution. And second, because we won it, Sefior. Is there a third reason to break the law? There's a new law. Président Madero's agrarian reform. That's not a law yet. First it has to be prepared and submitted to Parliament. After that, Parliament discusses it and eventually passes it. But until then, the law continues to protect private property. And the land belongs to its owners. - No, senor. - Yes, Sefor. No, no, that's not possible. Because we made a revolution and won it. Times have changed. I am the law, my boy. And you... ... are nothing. You're starting to get on my nerves. I declare you under arrest! And now, Sehor? what am i now A man who will be sentenced to death. We'd better go before he does anything else unreasonable. And we? You go with him, Don Calixto. Don't worry, Don Calixto. We will return. We will return with peace of mind. Vorwarts! God help them. Take it easy... They did indeed return. All those peons died. As you know, the machete is one thing, the machine gun is another. I am left alone and it seems impossible to me... ... that the revolution should have been good for nothing. We must see each other, Companero Madero. We need to talk to each other. If you don't call us this time , we'll call you. Drawn... ... Jesus Maria Moran. AKA Tepepa. country and freedom. Thank you. are you gonna kill me or not? Hey... Another time. Thank you. Beeil said, Louse. And explain to Madero everything that isn't in the letter. Watch out for Paquito. - Piojo, God bless you. - Bye for now. - Bye daddy. - Goodbye Louse. Goodbye, Tepepa. But now I'm sharp! Show yourself, senorita! Yes, dance for me, Chica! Away with the sombrero! Show yourself, senorita! Hey... Doctor. You nothing what? If you want, I'll pass it on to you as soon as I'm done. - Hey! - Hey... Francisco! Juan! Give him some air! Let's go. There aren't any bullets in there. - What? - It's not loaded. Doctor... The girl is ill. Probably appendicitis. Is that bad? She could die if the appendix is ​​not removed. what do you need to do it He has? At least some light. And all the alcohol you can find. She needs to rest. Wet your lips from time to time, but don't let them drink anything. Doctor, please help my boy. Did you see? One like you is important here. You've never seen a doctor in your life . why do n't you stay with us Doctor... come here. I think we know each other better now. I have often thought of you. And I believe... Well, as far as I'm concerned, you're more uneducated than all of us. And do you want to know why? You may know a lot about the intestines, the ears, the appendix, the nose... ... but you know nothing about the soul . Think about it. Isn't someone stupid who wants to kill another , even though he doesn't know him? Are you sure I'm the man you're looking for? On? Jesus Maria Moran. aka Tepepa. No no no. One moment. That's two pairs of boots. Jesus Maria Moran or Tepepa. Tepepa. There we have it! Mexico is full of tepepas. There are tepepas in Santa Cruz, in the Yucatan, in Guadalajara, in Mexico City. Even in this village there is another tepepa. There are lots of tepepas. Wait a moment. Mother... - How many tepepas are there in Mexico? - Lots. A single tepepa made revolution in Morelos. I have never been to Morelos. Never, never, never and never again. You do not believe me? Francisco! - Yes, Tepepa? - Come here! What is it, Tepepa? Francisco... we made the revolution together, didn't we? For sure. We've always been together, right? And. Were you in Morelos? Nein, no, Tepepa. No. You still don't believe me, do you? All right then. I don't know about your mother, but I care about mine. Roger that? I swear it on my mother's head. - Tepepa! - What is? Tepepa! Madero is here! Mother! Madero is here! Where is our President? Where is he? Where is he? He's waiting for us on the road to Toluca. He's waiting for us on the road to Toluca... On the road to Toluca... Marietal Marieta! Paquito! Paquito! Paquito! Yes, Papa? A present for you. Let's go, Piojo. Piojo, what are you waiting for? Let's go! Paquito is supposed to meet Madero. Madero can't wait for you! Let's go! No, I want to wait for my son. You really do look like Mendoza. Just like Mendoza. Believe me, I swear to you. He is the image of Mendoza, only in small. - Who is this Mendoza? - An admiral. We shot him in Morelos. And before he died he cried: 4Long live... Long live the Navy Hey Admiral! Let's go! Let's go, admiral. At your service, Admiral. Let's go! Louse! Come with peace of mind. Madero has nothing better to do. Yes, the longer he waits, the happier he is about it. - Come on, give me Paquito. I take him. - No, no, it's okay. We are nearly there. Tepepa... There he is. Without an escort. Nour Madero. I see it. Why are you telling me he doesn't have an escort, Piojo? Because he doesn't have any with him. Exactly how you wanted it, right? And... Exactly how I wanted it... It is very difficult for a father who has no hands... ... raising your child without a mother, right Piojo? right, Piojo? And. It's also harder to find a bigger jerk than me! Isn't that right, Piojo? Ha? No! One! Two! Three! Four! finf! So... So! So! So! To hell with you, you damned bastards! Our Father in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread . And forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen. Quiet... Come. Good horse. Good, good... Come come. stay down, stay down - And your father? - He is dead. - Those Rurales? - Tepepa. How so? Juanita! Juanita! Juanito, where are you? Tepepa! Tepepa. I fired all my shots. Who betrayed us? - The lice? - No. No. It wasn't El Piojo who betrayed me. It wasn't him. It was someone upstairs. Comrades... The honorable President of the Republic, Don Francisco Madero, has betrayed us all. Mexico and the Revolution. As long as there 's just one peon in Mexico... ... one of you without a piece of land, it's Madero's fault. And as long as there is one big landowner left in Mexico... ... 50 is Madero's fault. As long as there is even one rurale wandering around here in Mexico... ...burns things down and kills people, as happened here, Madero is to blame. And if Madero isn't aware of it, 50 it's still his fault! And the less he knows about all this, the more to blame for it! Do you think that if Madero betrayed the revolution... ... should we betray them too? No! Do you think that if Madero sits down, we should sit down too? No. And do you think that if Madero shits, we should shit too? - No! - No! If Madero shits, then we shit Madero! You will find us difficult here. At least for a while. Doctor, do you see that road over there? It will take you straight to Ciudad Juarez. You can't get lost. Paquito, let's go. - Paquito is coming with me. - He's coming with you? And. Look at that... If you're going that far, you need money, Paquito. That was your father's. Now it's yours. Take it. Take it. It's yours. Yes, that's fine. What a life, isn't it, Doctor? One comes, the other goes. But I am happy. Because you changed your mind about me. I haven't changed my mind about you. - Let's say I have doubts, nothing more. - Where there is doubt, there is hope, Doctor. Go with God. Goodbye Paquito. - Juan, the horse! - Yes. Miguel! What now, Tepepa? Find men, get weapons and start the fight from the beginning. Dr. Price? The train to California leaves at 5:30 this afternoon. Thank you. Come. - Please finish the bill. - Now, Sefor. Do you intend to leave us, Doctor? So early? Didn't you enjoy your stay in Mexico? It was an interesting and educational experience. Then why don't you stay with us longer? - You're welcome? - About 20 years, for example? If your criminal responsibility is proven. Your... your studies of Tepepa... Tepepa's cheekbones, his forehead, his ears. The whole thing is contradictory. Lombroso's theory is not absolute. Certain somatic data can not always be assigned to a criminal nature. You see, doctor, police reports, on the other hand , always have a trace. I assure you. Who is this? What's your name? Pereira. Pereira... i knew your father It went wrong. Injury. And the money? Did Tepepa take it? No. Why not? The father did it for him. He accepted the money because of him. Paquito! All right, wait for me upstairs. - I'll be right back. - ,I'll be right back"? I don't know. I have come a long way to speak to you. I don't want to hope I wasted my time. You sit down. It's better to make yourself comfortable. Jesus Maria Moran, aka Tepepa. Are you sure we're talking about the same person? And. 15. January 1910, Morelos. Hazienda von Juan Gonzalvo de Corufia. Testimony of Eduardo Ordofiez, Peon. It was four in the afternoon. We refused to work that day . The employer didn't even pay us the little that was enough... ... to buy some corn for our children. We had gathered in the yard when the hacienderos picked us up. Here we go! - Here we go! - Here we go! Here we go! Stand up! From. From. From. From. And you. Step forward! Miguel, the top haciendero, said nothing. He chose only five of us and let them undress. They always did that when they were supposed to flog us. Days before, one of our comrades had died from being lashed with the whip. etc., etc., etc. The rest is not interesting. Ah, this one. Testimony of Carlos Santamaria, Peon. They had already flogged the first four. Now it was Juan's turn... etc. etc. That doesn't matter. Also... Ah, here we are. Suddenly a band of men on horses appeared. The other! The one they called Tepepa shot first. Compafiero ... Take that. country and freedom. Testimony of Vicente Moreno, accountant. I saw Miguel die and saw who killed him. I immediately rushed to the employer's house not far away. Don Juan, Madero's people killed Miguel! No need to yell. How many are there? Testimony of Maria Virgen Escalante, domestic worker. I was in Sefiorita Consuelo's room. She had just finished bathing and I was there... ... to help her dry and get dressed. Good day. All of a sudden he was there. The employer's daughter? Get out! How so? am i dirty Allow? So... And now... Pig! Francisco. Take her away. The old. No! No! No! Francisco... I told you to take the old woman away. The! Testimony of First Lieutenant Luis Siqueiros... ... Police Commander of Coruna. Unfortunately we could do nothing more for the Senorita Consuelo de Coruna. When we arrived it was too late. Senorita! Senorital! That's all, doctor. This is Tepepa. If you're still interested, we can make a deal. Fresh fruit! Fresh fruit! - Good day. - Go with God. Fresh fruit! Paquito! What are you doing here? Come in. My wives... Go away! Sit down. - And your father? - He is dead. Oh I'm sorry. I know many were killed. Is it true someone was spying? No, that's not true. Well, that's what they said in the village... And Tepepa, where is he now? In the Mountains. In the mountains? And where there? In the mountains. Come on, my boy. Tepepa and the others are greedy for weapons. For me, Tepepa was always a good customer, but nothing more. But for you it should matter a little more. Or have you become a friend of the police? Hey... What a great thing! It's like a cannon. What a great thing! Sefior Chu... I would take her. But how am I supposed to pay you? The boy has already paid her. Thank you, Paquito. So you bought us guns with your money? It was government money, not mine. And who told you it was government money? Cascorro said so. Juan, grab some men and look around the area. All right, Tepepa. Let's go! Paco... - Where did you see Cascorro? - With the gringo. Juan! Come back! Listen... Charges everything. We miss from here. Cascorro is coming. Hey Sefor Chu... Where are you going? - Where are you going? - To Ciudad Juarez. - You stay here. - But... go! stand still Comrades! We're going to need a lot of water. Take as much as you can and don't waste a single drop. - Marieta ... - Already? What is the most important thing for a person who wants to cross the desert? Water. And if someone has a large supply of water with them: - What does that mean? - That he might cross the desert. Good. If you figured it out, Cascorro will figure it out too. Who? That's all Sefor Chu could tell him. What if Sefor Chu didn't tell him? He told him. Stop! Stop! Captain, look. We saw her. They're in the desert two miles from here. colonel. Vorwarts. Vorwarts! Do you have a match, doctor? Me because. It wasn't part of the deal, but... I can't take any chances. Stop! Turn off the engine. There we have human stupidity again. As soon as they hear rumblings, they worry. They realize that they are goats and calm down. But why are these goats there? Nobody thinks about that . That is precisely what is worrying. Kill these women! shoot! Take cover! Caution! Get out and start the engine. Now I'll kill that spy. No, he's a prisoner. Just look. Damn bastards! On them! What's the matter, Colonel? is she broken Good... Get off, we have to go. Walk... To where? What we must do, we cannot do alone. Do you remember having your own ideas about "land and liberty"? I'll take you to a place where you can spread your ideas in front of people. Go straight, sir. This is good for your Gesaf3. Good horse. Hey, Caution, Colonel. Good horse. There he is, companeros. I brought you Colonel Cascorro himself. - Are you badly injured, leader? - Oh, oh, oh. I help you. Doctor... Tepepa might live. My God... My God... My God... My God... My God... Ma, ma, ma, ma, ma. mama... Caution... And... Doctor... We need to talk about the senorita in Morelos. Seforita in Morelos... Look... We didn't know each other then. How was I supposed to know that was your Seforita? yours was... I thought she would like it. Careful, doctor. I haven't done anything bad. I only did what men do to women. What you did too. You too... Look, Doctor, I'd like to say that the women... ... are all the same. You are... Well, they're all cut from the same cloth. Right? But what's a girl compared to the revolution? Excuse me. I did not want to... Listen to me for a moment... A doctor can't kill, right? Of course not. If someone's a doctor... he's gotta save someone. A doctor must not kill. That's for sure... That's for sure. A doctor has to save you. A doctor's gotta save you... He's gotta save you. He's gotta save someone... He's gotta save someone... How stupid. How stupid. Imagine Doctor... ...you killed me because of a senorita. Because of a Seforita... Because of a Seforita... Because of a seforita... thank you doctor Thank you dear God. Renting... He is dead. Gringo! How so? Didn't you like the gringo? No. The gringo didn't like Mexico. Ei, e, eil Watch out, here comes Tepepa!
