Slavia Bank, accounts depaflment. Mr. Sembera? He's not here at the moment. May I take a message? Maternity hospital? It's the maternity hospital. A b0 y? A sin? Is it a boy or a girl? What? Twins? Twelve pounds? I'll tell him. Thank you very much. Sembera has twins. - He's got twins? He'll ceflainly be surprised. - What a godsend! Sembera Sembera, you're a father! You've got twins. Twins? A boy and a girl, twelve pounds. Congratulations. What a lucky man you are! - A boy and a girl? Congratulations. Good work! - And Are they twelve pounds each or together? Together, of course. - Congratulations. I must give the accounts to the chief. Let me do it. You've got other things on your mind now. Congratulations. The District Civil Coufl of Come in! I bring the accounts, sir. Continue, miss. The District Civil Court ofthe City of Prague Let's toast to your baby boy and girl. You didn't expect that, did you? - No and so didn't my purse. To that pair of yours, colleague. What is going on here? Office hours aren't over yet! How dare you put this on my table, Knotek?! I've never seen such a mess! Such negligent and sloppy work! Do you know how much it could cost the bank to mess up a current account like this?! Ten thousand more or less, it doesn't bother you, does it? - It's a mistake, sir. A mistake? It's total incapability! You're done here! But I - You? Do you know what you are? You're the most incompetent clerk ever employed in our bank! I'll see to that you get what you deserve! Please, sir Mr. Knotek, please, I Here's your coffee. Would you like a bun or two? No. Don't buy anyihing for me. Ever. Good evening, Mr. Knotek. - Good evening. Johnny. That's a good dog. What do you want? Wait, Johnny. Good dog. Good boy. Oh dear. What do you want? Stop it, Johnny. Be a good boy. You're hungry, aren't you? I'll give you something. I've brought you dinner. Here you are. Hop! Take it! There you are. Dear Sir, In response to the deplorable manner in which you have treated me What is it, Johnny? It seems we overslept. I wrote a letter to the chief telling him how unfairly he had treated me. Dear Sir, In response to the deplorable manner in which you have treated me, I would like to inform you that the erroneous current account was not counted by me but by my colleague, Mr. Sembera. I, Josef Knotek, have been employed in the Slavia Bank for 25 years and I have never made even the slightest mistake. Yours faithfully, Josef Knotek. Now the chief can howl Sembera down. Who is it? Good morning. Good morning. What brings you here? Quiet, Johnny! Come in. I'm in a hurry to the hospital to see my wife so I got up earlier today. - I see. My mother-in-law baked some cakes and since I'm taking some to my wife, I thought I could bring you some too. You shouldn't have gone to so much trouble. Thank you very much. - Not at all, colleague. Don't mention it. About yesterday, it was all because of me, I know. You're so kind for not telling him. Let's not talk about that. - Honestly, it was so so nice ofyou. I'm most grateful. Not at all. - Thank you very much. Good bye. - Good bye. And don't worry about the chief, you know what a shod-temper he has. He'll forget in a couple of days. Goodbye. - Thank you. It seems we have breakfast, Johnny. Stuffed cakes. It's delicious. Would you like some? Show me how you can beg. That's a good boy. There you are. It's not that simple with Sembera. You and me, we can eke out somehow. But feeding three kids is not easy. And he's been working at the bank for hardly three months. He'd get fired right away. Here you are. We can't do it to Sembera. It's such an awkward situation. If I'm not in the bank, Sembera will mix something up sooner or later and get fired all the same. Why are you looking at me like that? Are you interceding for him? Do you think I should keep an eye on him? The chief offended me! He's shod-tempered, I know. He means no harm, though. Running a bank isn't a simple thing to do. There's no other way if he's to keep things in order. All right, I'll forgive the chief and help Sembera. What's the matter? Why are you barking? Hush! I should be going. Quiet, Johnny! What's the matter with you? Mr. Knotek! Good morning! Did you oversleep? It's high time! Good morning. I'm going. Quiet, Johnny. Enough! Good bye. - Good bye. Good morning. Keep the toilet clean Shoo! Hush! Stop! Stop! Sir, get off the tram. Yes, you, with the light! Get off and stop delaying traffic. Move along, there's nothing to see here! Come with me! Turn it off. But, Inspector, I really don't understand Stop making a fuss and follow me! I've had enough ofthis! Do you mean to tell us you don't know about that thing above your head?! Above my head? I don't know what you mean. - Rosie! Lend him your mirror. - I'm no Rosie for you! Very well! Vasakova, lend him your mirror! Hurry up! Good Lord, what is it? Stop playing silly games! You won't fool us. How dare you run around the city with such a halo in broad daylight! And without a permit! But, Commissioner - Be quiet! Name? Name. - Josef Knotek. Date of biflh? - 4 October 1873. Where did you arrest him? - On a tram in Lesser Town Square. In Lesser Town Square. It looks like some son of glowing light. And it's not changing. It's been glowing like that for half an hour. Half an hour. It means from half past seven I'm surprised they fell for such a bamboozler. I'm sure Mary from Ungelt who plays the saint would find it quite useful. Silence! Keep your thoughts to yourself, Rosie. And it wasn't there yesterday? - It wasn't. But, Inspector - District Commissioner. Commissioner, how am I supposed to go to the bank with this? He must have a battery in his pocket. Search him. Put your hands up. - Gentlemen He's got nothing on him, sir. How long have you been doing this? - But, Commissioner Speak only when asked. - Put your hands down. A source of glowing light without any power supply or a battery. It's warm, sir. Try it yourself. Well? - It is warm. Good day, Commissioner. You'll keep an eye on them for a moment. And you're coming with me, Sebesta. Thank you very much. - You're welcome. Do sit down, holy man. Make some space! - Thank you. Here's a pretty go! I'm a teetotaller, Commissioner. Put me behind bars, Inspector. I've obviously had a drop too much. It's not so simple with him. Ifl repofl it, they'll put me in charge of an investigation. But how should we investigate such an odd thing? We're not supposed to investigate mysteries. Ourjob is to enforce law and order. But if we let him go, half ofthe city will follow him. Outside our district, mind you, and we'll get rid of him. Look, we can't charge him with incitement or with an offence against decency. How about disturbance of peace? Let him go. - Keep quiet! Mr. Knotek, stand up. That thing on your head is no trifling matter. You have caused turmoil and you pose a threat to public order. You walk in public with an open light source without a trade licence or a permit. Should this situation repeat itself, we would be forced to keep you here. You are free to go and I hope we will never see you again. But, Inspector, I can't go outside with this. You're right, you can't. (Lost and Found) - Wait. You can hide it this way. That's fine. Be off now. Umbrella! Umbrella! Be quiet, urchins! Do your mischief somewhere else! Good Heavens! Oh my God! A saint! Silence! This is a church! Where did you get that? - Get what? - That. Oh, that. That's mine. I thought it wouldn't bother anyone here. All these here are real. - So is mine. In that case, I'll fetch the priest. That would take too long. I'll throw them in the money-box. Kindly leave the church now. - Let me stay here. Leave the church at once! - I can't go outside with this. Get out! - ls this how you treat good Christians? I'll complain to the bishop! - Complain to the pope, if you like! Get out! Keep going! Heretic! Nothing is sacred anymore. District Health Insurance Office Patient Repons - Surgeries - X-Ray You need to register first. At the window over there. Thank you. - You're welcome. Why are you holding that umbrella? Come with me. Come this way. Good day. - What seems to be the matter? Look at what happened to me, doctor. MY 900dness! Well, I'll be damned! How on eaflh did you get it? I don't know, doctor. I can't take it off or hide it under my hat. What should I do? Let me see. It looks like a gloriole. - It does, doesn't it? I've never seen anyihing like that in my whole life. Neither did I. - It must be something quite extraordinary. A lot has been written lately about electric currents in the brain. Perhaps it is some son of radiation. I'll send you to a psychiatric clinic. Where? To a psy - To a psychiatric clinic. This has to be examined scientifically. The glowing light is visible to the eye. Take notes. With luminosity of approximately five candelas, the light does not oscillate or cast shadows. It does not react to air flow and it is non-inflammable. Do you experience any pain? - No. - Your parents were in good health? Yes. - Hereditary disorders or alcoholism? None. Venereal diseases perhaps? - No. - No. Are you or your relatives prone to religious exaltation, or mediumistic abilities or something like that? No, nothing like that. - Professor, is there a possibility that the light is caused by materialized brain waves? Electric brain activity and its registration Has been already described by Berger. However, not on such a case. Continue, colleague. Yes, sir. Let's take off your glasses. Look out of the window. No. Remain seated and watch my finger. Follow it with your eyes. All the time. I beg your pardon. Keep following my finger with your eyes. His convergence reaction is normal. - Normal. Close your eyes and touch the tip of your nose with your finger-tip. Normal. - Normal. Clasp your hands. Now pull them away with force. Close your eyes. Cross your legs. Now the other one. His knee-jerk is normal. - Normal. Have you ever suffered a head injury? No. - Have you ever had wild dreams? No, just once when I had a fever, I dreamt I was falling somewhere. Were you in the Salvation Army? No. I was only a member ofthe Sokol physical training union. A member of the Sokol. - The Sokol. What is troubling you? - Nothing. What is it that you want from us then? Professor, I beg you, get rid of it or let me stay here. I can't walk around in public with this. If you only knew what I had to go through. - Very well. He'll stay here and we'll perform all additional tests. I'm so grateful, Professor. Come here. Pee into this. Over there. Spread your fingers, put them together. Spread your fingers. Negative. Mingazzini is negative. Is it painful? - No. - And this? - No. Tapping on the head is not painful. It tickles! - Babinsky is negative. Breathe. Take nice deep breaths. No, no! No hereditary disorders. No alcoholism, kleptomania, or suicide! I wasn't in the Salvation Army! I'm usually calm and collected! But what you've been doing to me could easily drive me insane! Calm down, everyihing will bejust fine. We will send you home and you will come for a check-up in some time. Professor, let me stay here, I can't go among normal people with this. From a clinical view, you're quite healthy. I'm sending you home. Have mercy, gentlemen. I want to stay here! I can't go outside with this, Professor! I want to stay here! Help! Help! Who is it? - It's me, Dr. Vanasek from the Health Insurance Office. Dr. Vanasek? Good evening, doctor. Come in. - Thank you. Good evening. I was in the neighbourhood calling on a patient so I stopped by. How are you feeling? Is it still glowing? - It is. - Let me have a look. It is indeed glowing. I'm finished, doctor. I can't go outside with this. Show me your tongue. More. Did the psychiatrists examine you? You may close your mouth. For three days. They were driving me insane. Science demands patience, my friend. You'll be a famous scientific case one day. I almost am. Be quiet, Johnny?! Not even the poor animal can stand looking at me. I'll leave some bromine for you. It's paid from your health insurance. Take a spoonful before going to bed and give some to your dog too in case it doesn't calm down. You see, I'm not much of a believer in the supernatural. The cause must be neural. It isn't, doctor. - Do you think so? Listen, Mr. Knotek, you haven't done anyihing, how should I put it, anyihing saintly by chance, have you? Saintly? - I mean something unusual. A vifluous deed or something like that. A vifluous deed? Listen, if I were in your place, I would sin a little. Sin? What do you mean, doctor? To curse, blaspheme against God. Blaspheme? - It won't do you harm and it's woflh a try. Maybe it will disappear. Take care of yourself. Good night, Mr. Knotek. - Good night. In case it doesn't disappear, come to my surgery. Good night. Good night. Thanks a lot. Shut up. I can't stand listening to you! Blaspheme. It's easy to say blaspheme! Blimey! Damn it! What a damned life! Damned lousy life! To hell with it! But I won't leave it this way! I've been considerate more than enough! - Calm down, Mr. Knotek. Wait, please, don't ruin my life. They'll fire me. Look what became of me! Good Heavens, you can't go in the office with this. I don't care anymore! I'm a mere scientific case! With files at the clinic and the police, I can have another one with the chief! Not so loud, please, someone might hear you. Let them all hear me! And you ought to mind your own business and stop making mistakes for which others have to pay! I know, it was all my fault. - You won't mollify me! How can a wisp of a fellow like you have twins! How careless! Besides, you can't even add one and one together! Look at what a mess you've made! - Please, Mr. Knotek. Don't do it! Have mercy! - Mercy?! Does anyone have mercy on me? Everyone should mind their own business! Enough! The bank is not supposed to help anybody! Everyone should mind their own business! It's simple as that! I therefore propose the following Do you see that? To get the record straight, sir, the messed up current account for which you dressed me down was not my work at all! There's hardly a bigger spitfire and a brute in the world! You're good at pestering your employees! Mr. Knotek, calm down. We'll son this out. There's nothing to son out. You never howl down the girls. You dictate to them. But is it really so? Where does such a girl get the money to buy her make-up and silk stockings? I beg your pardon! I agree with you, colleague. And then someone plays the stock market and the bank goes bankrupt! Mr. Knotek, please. - There's nothing but dir1y tricks everywhere and one should just watch and keep silent. Not me, sir. I won't keep silent any longer! That current account thanks to which you almost fired me was messed up by Sembera. Not me! So be so kind and dress him down instead of me! The light... it went out. It's gone. It's all right. It's gone. THE MYSTERY OF WRITING Directed by The queen of spades is a woman. The main cause of your trouble. Yes. It is true. Is it - Divide the pack into three. Into three. There. Disaster is approaching your home. Disaster? I see. Disaster! Disaster! - Here. You see? The jack of heads in a Prague street. Jack in a Prague street. ls he coming from the country or from abroad? The Prague street means he is close to you. - I see. Look, this is you, that's the man and the woman is here. The ten of clubs behind her means great doubts and unceflainty. Yes, great unceflainty. - She hesitates. She hasn't decided yet. - Decided what? You're jealous of her. Suspicious. Is she unfaithful? Infidelity Where is infidelity? Here. The queen of clubs is still far from your home. Beware of the jack in the Prague street, though. I should, shouldn't I? ENTRY KARLIK DETECTIVE BUREAU KARLIK IS DISCREET AND RELIABLE Your wife. If I'm not mistaken, we are to watch her. Yes. - Discreetness is guaranteed. Our bureau is reliable. We've received hundreds ofthank you letters. Kindly fill in your name and address. The advance is fifty crowns. How much? - Fifty crowns, sir. She was in Spalena Street and at the milliner's from 10.00 to 10.30 am. She then went by tram to Mustek where she entered Sterba's Confectionery at 10.40 am. She sat alone and ordered two cakes and Viennese Coffee. She left a half-crown tip. She went to the hairdressefis at 11.10 am. I need facts. I need to be cenain. I need evidence. Some cases need time. And oppoflunity. - What?! Yes, every case is different. One can never be too careful in the city where one is constantly watched. Do you have a weekend house? - Listen here Let's go to my office. - With pleasure. What did you mean? - A shod business trip may also serve our purpose or you may send your wife to a spa. Provide her with a little more freedom. I had a case once, the name is not relevant. We were following the lady for 6 months with no result. Yet, after three days in Marienbad, we caught her in the very act. Listen - Good day. Good day, the boss - Do not disturb him. I'll look at some sets in the meantime. Do you have Good day, Coufl Counsel. Goodbye, Coufl Counsel. - Farewell. Hello. Why don't you go to the back and son the auction items. What business have you with that fellow? Is it ...? - It is. It seems you'll soon divorce me, Tony. You don't say! - ls it you? Your wife Maflha? No. She's unfaithful, my friend. Have you got any evidence? - No, none at all. That's the worst thing. I'm not getting any younger and if Maflha came herself and asked me We'd agree somehow. I'm no savage. But the unceflainty is unbearable. - I believe you. Sometimes, it's not easy to find evidence. I believe in happenchance. In accidental, I daresay, uncontrolled manifestations that one lets slip now and then. One has to be a psychologist. Pure truth is encountered in this valley of tears only when a human being spills the beans. This is nice. - What should I do? Well It's a matter of experience, my friend. A woman always lets herself get caught. Sometimes, all it takes is a single word. One lies even when one doesn't have to. - Yes You're absolutely right, it's nothing but pretence and lies. You know I'd do anyihing to please Maflha. If only I were ceflain of her fidelity. Jealousy, my friend, is terrible. Why should a decent woman let herself be dishonoured for nothing! - For nothing?! Did you hear that, Your Honour? Infidelity is nothing! You're a jealous and suspicious tyrant who's spying on me all the time! It's no life. It's a purgatory! - It's sheer hell, Your Honour! Silence, please. As you can see, plaintiff, nothing in the testimonies of the witnesses proves the defendant guilty of marital infidelity. What about the Mr. Vflatkds letters? He debauched my wife! Mr. Vrtatko testified that his intimate relationship with your wife had ended long before her marriage. - Yes! Long before my marriage. Silence! Pre-marital relationships are irrelevant to the court. There are plenty of marital matters the court has to deal with. If you have no new evidence, I advise you to withdraw your petition and stop wasting your money. But, Your Honour, I - Think it over. Defendant, there is one thing I've been wanting to ask you. Didn't Mr. Vnatko cure his TBC in a mountain sanatorium? TBC? No. As far as I know, he was keen on ski jumping. As a leisure spor1 I presume. - No, as a professional. He even won a silver medal in the Tatras despite not being in a good shape. I mean I read it in the papers. That's interesting. Do you remember in what newspaper by chance? No. I don't remember. - You don't remember. Very well. Incidentally, I have a results repofl from the Skiers Union of all competitions held in the Tatras, in which Mr. Vflatko paflicipated. And it says here that Mr. Vflatko won a silver medal in the Tatras only once and it was this year. I don't seem to understand - Just a moment, please. In the file, appended under Annex M, we have a letter signed: "With love from your Bohous." Allow me to quote the letter. "Had I been in a better shape, sweetheart, I would have won gold." You claim it is a letter written to you before your marriage. The letter is not dated, nonetheless, as mentioned before, Mr. Vflatko has won a silver medal in the Tatras only this year. It is thus obvious that the letter is also from this year. All this proves that you have not spoken the truth and that you have committed marital infidelity. There you have it! I said it was Vflatko! Indeed. I believe the defendant will plead guilty and we may close the case. Where were we? - The defendant claims In accordance with the lodged action, the defendant pleads guilty of committing marital infidelity. Bravo, Tony. It was marvellous work. How you cornered her and forced her to confess. If only I could do it the same way. I'd give anyihing to finally learn the truth. - lt needs time, my friend. It took five hearings to make the woman convict herself. Where did she go? She had to say something! Perhaps she went shopping. - Nonsense. She went shopping yesterday. Wasn't she going to see someone? Did anyone call her? Someone did. - Who was it? Tell me! I don't know, sir. She answered the phone herself. I see. What is it? Wait! What was she wearing? The beige pleated dress, a light-coloured hat, snakeskin coufl shoes a bag, a pink chemise Enough! Be off. Where did you go afterwards? I went for a shod walk in the park. And then? - I sent the money orders you had given me. The post office was crowded. Then I went to the cemetery to visit mother. To the cemetery? And what about the hairdressefis? Maflha, why aren't you telling me the truth? Why are you so suspicious all the time?! Since you're spying on me, why don't you search me! Here are the tram tickets. - Martha, dear Manha - I can't stand it anymore! This is no life! This is a purgatory! Maflha, dear Maflha What a pleasant surprise! Welcome, Aflhur. - How are you? We haven't seen each other for ages. - Indeed. Young and charming as always, Maflha. What can I do for you, Aflhur? I need to buy a small gift. I see. What did you have in mind? Is she a blond or a brunette? You will never change, Aflhur, will you? Where are you going on holiday this year, Aflhur? I don't know yet, it depends on the situation. But I'll see you in Senohraby in August. Maflha I thought it might be best for you to go to a spa. Wouldn't you like that? Do you want to make up for what you've done? - It would do you good. You could relax and enjoy a little freedom. I couldn't come with you right away but I could join you in a foflnight or so if you want. Excuse me. I beg your pardon. Thank you. Have we got everyihing? - I beg your pardon, madam. Not at all. It was my fault. ls this seat free? You may sit by the window if you like. - You are most kind. No, you'd sit in a draught and it's a smoker's compaflment. We can smoke in the corridor. - Thank you. You must have a comfoflable journey. - Oh yes. Over here. - ls this seat free? What's this? - I don't know. Bye! Don't forget to write! You're a grass widower now, aren't you? We are going to the spa this year too. During the coufl holidays, aren't we, dear? To Marienbad? - It's our favourite, isn't it, dear? Yes. - Let's hope you and your wife will still be there when we arrive. There. - Excuse me. I need your advice. Do you think he will like it? You see, we are celebrating our twentieth wedding anniversary soon. - I am sure he will like it very much. It's marvellous work. - I'm so happy. Never mind. Well. Isn't it strange how - You two surely have a lot to talk about. Besides, I have work to do. - Yes, dear. Thank you. I envy you, Tony. Your marriage is so happy Really? I must admit it's working well, though. How are things with you and your wife? - I've tried almost everyihing. I waited for her to give herself away as you told me. She often lied to me but - It's a typical woman's habit. A woman will never tell you she spent two hours at the milliner's. She will claim she was at the dentist or the hairdressefis. These half-truths and half-lies, old chum, are the pillars of normal human relations, especially in marriage. Why did you let her go to the spa? I'm so ashamed. She's being watched there to. By that fellow you know. I know. You're wasting your money. Only happenchance will provide you with downright evidence. Trust me. It needs time. - Time, time! But the unceflainty is unbearable! I'm not much of a believer in the supernatural. Jensen is one ofthe world's best, you'll see. If you say so. Jensen! Come, I've arranged everyihing. Pretend that you're repoflers. I'm highly interested in your opinion. This way, gentlemen. These are the main principles of scientific psychometric graphology. As you can see, the overall system is built on purely experimental laws. The practical use ofthese exact methods is quite complex. Mr. Jensen will therefore analyse two or three samples of hand-writing, without explaining the whole process. We do not have time for that. - He's a swindler. Gentlemen, could you provide us with a hand-written document? A hand of a woman. Mr. Jensen says that a man's writing is usually more distinct and attractive. The woman who wrote this has correct moral values. She does not steal or lie and she is not deceitful. Her hand is soothing, as if a hand of reconciliation. She is devoted. She is someone one can rely on. Everyihing seems quite all right. This writing is in no way special. Mr. Jensen would like another, a more interesting sample. Have you got something? Coufl files. - That's perfect. Is it from a person close to you? By no means. - Every writing has its fluidum, you see. It is a purely physical phenomenon. In this case, Mr. Jensen does not need to see the writing, merely touching it is sufficient. It is a deceitful woman. She is a low person, quite lustful and disorderly. Her home must be rather unsightly. She is superficial with down-to-eaflh interests. Yet, she is only hiding her true thoughts. She is extremely fond of comfort That is why she throws herself at a person, persuading him how well she is taking care of him. She is one those women in the face of whom any man is a weakling. Her endless chattering turns him into a weakling. She wants to order others about and she does just that. Interesting. It's a fitting description. May I ask a question, please? How does she have her will? Through the vilest tyranny. The tyranny of tears. At the same time, she is hiding something, perhaps from the past. She is peculiar about little things but when it comes to major things, she lacks discipline. She is simply a slattern. The writing bespeaks of insidious thoughts. Sharp as a stab in the back. Although, she will not do it for she is too self-indulgent. That seems to be all. Remarkable! It fits the case precisely. He got everyihing right. The woman is a notorious criminal. I went to see my mother. Dinner is in the stove. Elizabeth. A world sensation, eh?! He's a cheater! A woman who doesn't lie and will never deceive anyone. He's a swindler. - What? - What? It's just happenchance. He gets it right the first time but not the second. He got your case right, didn't he? It seems I forgot the file at home. At home? How come? - There was a note from my wife. What? Your wife? Nonsense! He's a swindler! Happenchance A satisfied husband makes a happy housewife. Dinner is in the stove. Add a little water to the rice. You're home already? - Why? Hedvika kept me long, she wouldn't stop talking. You haven't had dinner yet. I'll heat it up for you in a jiffy. What? - What? Nothing. Nothing! I've made your favourite beef tongue on anchovies. All you keep talking about is food! Down-to-eaflh interests. I know, it turns men into weaklings. Beef tongue on anchovies! Why are you talking like that, dear? ls something the matter? You're always so caring, aren't you?! Don't be silly. Don't you know your wife? Don't you trust her? It can be all just pretence. And pretence is not easy to reveal. Only through science. Like Jensen. And I say maybe. You know I had her note on me. And that's the accidental evidence! Do you think you could actually live with someone for twenty years without noticing anyihing? - Jensen opened my eyes. Only now I see all the deceitfulness. All of a sudden, I see how she threw herself at me to live in comfort To satisfy her lustfulness! How disgusting! Did I do something to you? I'm not aware of anyihing. There was never a cross word between us and now What are these rags doing here?! I was mending your shins. You were mending my shifls? Well, well! Do you think it allows you to order me about?! No! It will all stop now! No! If you have something against me, say it straight! What do I know about you? Nothing at all! You are hiding your secrets well! I don't even know your past! I beg your pardon! What is the matter with you? Nothing is the matter with me! First of all, I'll get rid ofthe rags! They're only in the way. There! Well, look here! There we have it! You're peculiar about little things. While, in fact, you're nothing but a slattern! Does this belong there?! - Did I deserve this after 20 years? I want you to tell me what I have done wrong. Nothing. Nothing at all! Is it wrong that one's wife is disorderly, deceitful and lustful? No! Moreover, such a low person! Stop it! You won't fool me any longer with that tyranny of tears! BEWARE OF GLASS Look. It's old Janowitz's wife with such a youngling! They're all the same. Poor Janowitz. I'm sure he doesn't know his wife is a cheater. How can one trust them. And that detective, that leech, keeps writing that everyihing is quite all right. Everyihing is quite all right while she is able to stab you in the back. Although, she is too self-indulgent to do it. A letter from Maflha. Won't you read it? I know it by head. I suppose Oh my! She gave herself away! She finally did! Dear Aflhur.

I was asking you to join me, that I miss you and things like that. It got probably lost on the way. Shall we join Tony on the colonnade? But let me change first. Did you enjoy yourself here, dear? I'll tell you everylhing. Go ahead and I'll join you. As I have informed you, everyihing is quite all right. Here's your money. I won't need you anymore. I had some cash expenses, sir. Just a trifle one can't avoid in a spa. Expended in the client's best interest. - Keep the change. Thank you, sir? Look, Jensen! There's no use denying it. He got everyihing right. Just in my case, I mean. What about the letter, honey? Did it help? Who is it? - It's me, sir. Good day, sir. - Good day. I'm at your service, sir. I must admit I feel a little ashamed of myself. Frank trusts me so much now. I'll take the evening train. - Why all so early? I don't want to leave my wife alone for so long. You're absolutely right. Our wives can't be without us. Can they? A LEGAL CASE Directed by ls he here? Good evening. I was in the neighbourhood so I thought I could stop by to see if you were home. You don't look well. I hope it's not the flu. I thought it was him. - Who? The dead old man! - Oh yes. The dead Perhaps I should come when you're feeling better. I'm not sick. I'm fine. I'm quite all right. Believe me. It's just that this whole thing got me a little confused. That damned old man! And you are? - I'm from the insurance company. From the insurance company, I see. I have it right here. His death ceflificate. It's for the pension, you see? I see. A death ceflificate for the pension. We don't do that, sir. We're an insurance company. I came because of your car insurance. I won't keep you, though. I can come at another time since you're expecting that man. He's not coming. Not tonight. Would you like a cup of coffee? Yes? I'll make some coffee. - Yes. You - But You can't imagine what I've been going through because of him. Oh no. - I'll make us some coffee. - No, thank you, I don't drink coffee. I know. I'm afraid to stay home, at work I'm restless. I keep hiding, yet he finds me everywhere. - Oh yes. Everywhere, everywhere! - Oh yes. I'll make the coffee. - Yes. And it's happening at night, isn't it? I know what I'm talking about. Not at night but in the day! That's what's strange about it. He goes home at night. By train. He's got an employee pass so he travels almost for free. You see, he's a retired railwayman. And the point is they took away his pension when he had died. - When he had died. I would be surprised if they didn't, wouldn't you? That's why he keeps coming to me. During the day, you say? - All the time, all the time. That's interesting. I've never heard of such a thing. Some people nowadays, eh? They die, and they still want their pension. Good heavens! I completely forgot I was supposed to I'll stop by some other time. - Don't go! I've got to tell you! Please stay. I'm so glad you're here. Try to understand me. He's dead. In a way at least. Everyihing was just fine. It says here in black and white in his death ceflificate. Antonin Banos, retired railway employee. He wouldn't be that bad if it weren't for his kin. They're setting him against me. So is he dead or not? To be quite frank, it's all so crazy. It's complete nonsense. Absolute nonsense. Completely crazy! Completely crazy. Just a moment! Calm down. Take it easy. The coffee is ready, isn't it? It happened some six months ago. I was driving at a speed of some 50 miles per hour towards a bend, thinking that the road behind it was free. Well, I was awfully wrong! It's Grandfather! What's the matter? What time is it? Grandpa, they almost buried you! It's Grandpa! Our grandpa, look! - Do you see that? M373'- Frank. Hurry! Clear the way. That skid came just in time, don't you think? Why are you so pale, Charlie? Come, Grandpa, I'll take you home. You'll rest a while and we'll send for a doctor. What for? - He's so cute. Everyihing will be just fine. You'll feel like a newborn! Would you be so kind and show me the way, Father? Let's see if you can get in. - Give me your hand, Father. With the Lord's help, we may be able to Watch your step, Father How are you feeling, Grandpa? Oh dear. I'll pay for the coffin and for the doctor. You're a damned lucky man. Just to think what would have become of you if my car had not skidded. You can thank me for not being buried alive. Am I right, Father? It's all right. We're here, Grandpa. Slowly, don't rush. Wait. Don't move. Slowly. Like a newborn. Like a newborn baby. There Look at how well he is walking. Wait! Wait here. Don't move. Father You're home, Grandpa. Do you understand? After you, Father. Good Lord! What a beautiful place! And the fresh air! Well Well, Grandpa. What would you like? I'd like my pipe. Your pipe, eh? Where is your Pipe? Here it is. Maybe they wanted to throw it away. It will serve you long and well. Well, I ought to be going now. Farewell, Father. I'm so glad it ended so well. I hope you enjoy a couple more years. Why don't you come to Prague for a visit some day. I'd take you to the ZOO or a museum. Let's write it politely. As the family wished the grandfather, Antonin Banos, to have a proper funeral, it used up all its savings. However, since the grandfather has been risen from the dead, as a result of your reckless driving, it will be necessary to bury him once more, which the above-named family cannot afford. Tell him that he has to pay for the whole ruined funeral. Including your fee, Father. - The band, the caretaker and the wake! Of course - And my shroud too. He rose you from the dead so he should put things in order. One cannot fool around with such things without paying for it. Either he'll get your pension back or he'll pay it himself. It's a clear legal case. We will surely find suitable aflicles of law. First of all, we will claim smafl money from him. I presume it could amount to five thousand. Is something troubling you, Mr. Kupr? - Yes. I mean, no. Good day! What brings you here, Grandpa? How are you? Didn't I tell you? You're like a newborn! You'll enjoy a couple more years. I wish God would take me. Why are you talking like that? It's the old man I told you about. A fine fellow, isn't he? If it weren't for me, he wouldn't have been standing here. I came because of my pension. They say I'm not entitled to it because I'm dead. How can they say that? You're as fit as a fiddle! They say they have a ceflificate. What ceflificate? You're here, alive and well. Go there in person. - Do you think it will help? Of course it will. But my son, his wife and even the lawyer told me that you should pay me a lifelong annuity, you see? But - I think it's nonsense too. It is nonsense. Look, go to the office yourself, tell them you're not dead and that you have a right to receive your pension. Good bye. Nobody saw me? Are you sure? Which floor is it? - 6th floor. Is it far from the lift? - No. I'm afraid. - There's no need. There's hardly a chance somebody might see you. I'd have to leave at once. It's not woflh it. He's awfullyjealous. Don't worry. There's absolutely no chance somebody - Good evening. Why didn't you go home? They're sending me from one office to another. So I came to you. I'm officially dead for them and I'm not entitled to my pension. You won't let them treat you like that, will you? Of course not! I've been ailing since you rose me from the dead. You've crippled me! I'm not my old self anymore! I'm good for nothing. They have to make more solid meals for me! Do something! Grandpa! Mr. Baflos! ls this how you express your gratefulness? Is this what I get for saving you? I literally helped you escape the grave! Enough! I don't want to hear another word! What do you want? Listen Stop following me. From now on I don't know you. This is the 20th century, address your claims to the insurance company! Farewell! It was all over and now I have to die once more. He will pay or I'll take it to the Supreme Court Let me tell you something, Mr. Kundera. It should be punished the same way as murder. He won't get rid of me as long as I live. As long as I live! 890. He'll drive me crazy. Or I'll have to run him over once more. I don't see any other solution. One shouldn't interfere with fate or he's asking for big trouble. Calm down and come back. It's not him. It can't be. It's at the neighbour's door. He always rings twice. Maybe he won't come. Maybe he went to the insurance company. And maybe he'll never come again! He won't come again, will he? Ever. It's such an awkward situation for me, Mr. Kupr. How should I put it. Look, Mr. Kupr, take it as a joke, be a sport The thing is Tell me! Calm down and tell me. The thing is you haven't paid your car insurance policy. I'm back. A SAD END GLORIA Cast THE MYSTERY OF WRITING Cast A LEGAL CASE Cast
