(upbeat music) - Tell me, how was school today? - Meh. - Ah, school was meh. - Anything on TV tonight? - Meh. A lot of meh. - You must have a talk with that boy, Guido. - I will. Thank you. (phone ringing) Hello? Yes, who's this? Oriana? What is it, what time is it? Is anything wrong? It's papa? A bad stroke? It happened two days ago? Two days, and you never let me know? My God, who would you disturb? What nonsense. Hey, you talked to the doctor. But it can't be possible. He's been such a healthy man. Jesus. But listen, how serious is it? Of course, but I don't see how I can make it up there before... Wait, maybe I can. Yes, if you say I should get there. Please, don't tell me it's better. Tell me to get there or not. Uh-huh. How bad is he? No, no, I'll be there as soon as I can. Who knows? I'd say between noon and two. I'll have to speak to the bank and tell them. The Pisa Road is quicker. And be sure to tell mama. Tell her I'll be there today. I'm going to get ready now. Don't you worry about a thing. I'll be there this afternoon. Ciao. (car engine revving) (phone ringing) - Hello? - Hello, is that you, Jennifer? - Who's this? - Guess. Me. Jennifer, why don't you answer? You guessed and fainted dead away, huh? Jennifer. Hey. Listen, darling, can you hear me? Psst, psst. (Guido whistles) - Yes, yes, I hear you. - Good. Hey, do you remember that terrific trip I promised you last summer? - What? What trip? - [Guido] Three days, just the two of us. The trip we didn't take. - No, I don't get it. - Get dressed, pack your suitcase, and I'll pick you up in 10 minutes, okay? (knocks on door) Jen-- - Thank you. - Where's Jennifer? I'm looking for Jennifer. - She's asleep. - But I just spoke to her on the phone. - She was up late last night. - Ah. - [Guido and Anita] Who are you? (laughing) - I'm an old friend of Jennifer's from the States. I'm just here for a couple of days. - I see. Well, I'm an old friend of Jennifer's too. An old friend from last summer. I've come to pick her up, but I'm sorry if I'm disturbing you, if I woke you up so early. - Oh no, don't worry about it. I was already up. I have an appointment. - Ah. - Oh no, not that door. I sleep there. The other one. - She changed. It's not her bedroom anymore. - [Anita] I guess not. (knocks on door) (whistles) - [Guido] Jennifer. Jennifer, dear. Come on, wake up. - Mm. - [Guido] Come on. It's time to go. She's dead to the world. Do me a favor please, and make some strong coffee for her, so she'll come to, eh? Oh, and these are yours. - [Anita] Thank you. - Thank you. Come on. (claps) Wake up. Jennifer. (whistles) Jennifer. Ooh, that feels nice. Jennifer. Come on. Come on. Wake up, wake up. - I'm so sleepy. - No, it's time to go. Come on. - I want to sleep. - You want to sleep? - Mm-hm. - Okay, okay. Sleep, sleep. That's better. Don't worry. I want you just to relax. Yes. I'll take care of everything. - Please, Charlie. Charlie, let me sleep. - The name is Guido, but don't worry about it. We'll talk about that later. Are you crazy? - Get the hell out. Who let you in here? - Your friend. The blonde. - You pig. Get out. - Come on, who's a pig? But excuse me. Just a minute ago, I spoke to you on the phone about our trip. Remember? But when I saw you like this... Come on, Jennifer. Don't be so angry. Don't you remember all the days we spent together? Last summer. It was wonderful, hm? - I would like to inform you that the only thing I recall about you is your sudden, unexplained disappearance four months ago. And all I want is to forget that I ever met you in the first place. Out! - Oh, no. It was always my dream to take a trip with you. And I came here the moment I could. If I remember right, you wanted to go to Pisa, didn't you? - To Pisa? - Pisa, Genoa, anywhere you want. Tell me where you want to go. - [Jennifer] To sleep. - No, come on. - [Jennifer] Get out. - [Guido] Jennifer. Ah, Jennifer, please. - [Jennifer] Get the hell out, and never come back here again. - [Guido] Jennifer! - [Jennifer] Outside! - Wait a moment, please. Open the door. Please come with me. I need you. I can't be alone. Jennifer. Is the coffee ready? - [Anita] Yeah. - Okay, I am too. Sun's out. Thank you. I have to drive. - Where are you going? - Up north. To Pisa. - How is it? - How's what? - The coffee. - Oh. Not bad. - Is it very far? - What? - Pisa. - No, not too far. Is there any more coffee? If not, when I drive, I tend to get sleepy at the wheel. - If you're going that way, would you mind taking me with you? - No, glad for the company. How long do you need to get ready? - Five minutes. - Okay. Just time enough to get some gas. I'll be back in five minutes. Don't be late. Meet you downstairs. Don't forget. (bell ringing) What's that? - Tricky. - [Guido] It's not coming with us. Can't you leave it here with that charming friend of yours? - [Anita] No. I found him in the Forum last night. I'm gonna keep him. What's the matter, don't you like cats? - [Guido] I don't know. Yet. - [Anita] I'm wild about cats. - [Guido] Why? - [Anita] Well, because cats are free, independent, and not into pleasing everybody else. - [Guido] Are you like that? - Nope. Listen, is the Trevi Fountain on our way north? - No, it isn't. Why do you ask? - I have to stop by there before we leave. Remember, I told you I had an appointment this morning. - What? What kind of appointment? - Just one line in a commercial. Jennifer got it for me. It'll be five minutes at the most. Really. - I see. Okay. - [Director] Camera! - 93-12 Off Shore. - [Director] Action! - [Announcer] Off Shore. The aftershave for la dolce vita. - As soft as the touch of a woman in love. - As sharp as the sting of a jealous lover. (gasps) - [Director] Cut! Oh my God. - I'm sorry. - 11 takes. After 11 takes, this is ridiculous. What the hell's the matter with you? You do not turn your head. You stand there and smile happily. - But it's a natural response. I know he's gonna hit me. I'd like to see how you take it. - We are paying you $200 to take it. Now do you want your money or not? Or is this going to take another two hours? - Okay, let's go. - Places. Camera! - 93-13 Off Shore. - [Director] Action! - [Announcer] Off Shore. The aftershave for la dolce vita. - As soft as the touch of a woman in love. - And as sharp as the sting of a jealous lover. - Cut! Where in the hell did she come from? Who sent her here? I'm gonna kill her, I swear. - [Anita] I didn't move. - Just who did you bring us, anyway? - Me? - Mm-hm. - No, you're wrong about that. I'm not even in show business. - Oh sure, you agents are never responsible. But you always get your 10%. - For real? - Yeah. Got it? - Yeah. - Let's go! Camera! - [Assistant] 93-14 Off Shore. - [Director] Action! - [Announcer] Off Shore. The aftershave for la dolce vita. - As soft as the touch of a woman in love. (gasps) - As sharp as-- - [Director] Stop it! Cut! Get that dame out of here before I tear her apart! Get me somebody else. - Fine, all right. Just give me my money. - Out, out, out! - Hold on a sec. You've ruined the scene, you've beaten the actor, you've cost us I don't know how much! - I got hit, I get my money. - You get nothing. Now I suggest you disappear. - Oh yeah? - [Producer] Let go, let go! (all arguing) - Hm. They thought they could push me around. Well, I've got a pretty good nature, but they pushed me just a little too far. - [Guido] Seems to me you were doing most of the pushing. - [Anita] Well, of course, didn't you see? He hit me when I wasn't expecting it. - [Guido] Look, you want to be an actress. So it's a pretty tough career. - Me, an actress? - Yes. - That was a first and a last time. Oh, I told you Jennifer got it for me. Come on, go back there and be good. Oh. Hoo. Oh. Ooh. - You and Jennifer are good friends? - Um, sort of. We know each other from the States. See, I have this 14-day excursion ticket, and I had several days to go before I could leave, and that damn hotel was so depressing. I called Jennifer, and she's been just great. - Hm. - At least I don't feel so damn lonely. - Why did you come here? To Italy, I mean. - To have a good time. I've got five days left, and I'm gonna see if I can swing it. ♪ Move from place to place ♪ I'd like to see a different face ♪ ♪ 'Cause then there's something here ♪ ♪ That won't let me settle down ♪ ♪ Something here makes me want to get around ♪ ♪ Move ♪ Just move ♪ Soon, I don't know when ♪ I'll set out on the road again ♪ ♪ Just take my time to see ♪ What the world will offer me ♪ Take my time on the highway, being free ♪ ♪ Move ♪ Just move (car engine revving) ♪ Just move ♪ Just move ♪ Move from place to place ♪ I'd like to see a different face ♪ ♪ 'Cause there is something here ♪ ♪ That won't let me settle down ♪ ♪ Something here makes me want to get around ♪ ♪ Move ♪ Just move - What are you doing? - Nothing. - Right.

(Anita hums) Why are you driving so fast? - I'm trying to make up some of the time we lost. - Why? - I like to drive fast, you understand? If I don't drive fast, I start to break out in a rash. - Hm. (hums) - [Instructor On Tape] Good day, fellow students. In today's Italian lesson, we talk about... (speaking Italian) We eat rice in China. (speaking Italian) Potatoes in Germany. (speaking Italian) Spaghetti in Italy. - What the hell is this? - Spaghetti. I'm learning to speak Italian. There's nothing better to do. - Ah. There's something better to do, but unfortunately you don't like that sort of thing. - Who said? - You said. - I never said that. - Well, what did you say? - I said that I do like that kind of thing, but it's so cold like this. - Who said I didn't feel anything for you? How do you know I didn't fall in love with you at first sight, hm? - Look, if you want me to believe this, then try being a little nicer. Please don't drive so fast. - I told you, I'm only trying to make up some of the time you cost. See how late it is? Look. What are you doing? (brakes screeching) (cars crashing) - [Man] Where am I? - Look at that. Look what you've done. Idiot. A joke. Don't say a word. I'll handle it. You sit and learn some more Italian. Where the hell is your seeing-eye dog? You've got to be blind. You must have seen me brake when that dog ran in front of me. - Who the hell is the stupid bastard who caused this whole mess? Where is-- - Here he is. His car swerved to avoid hitting me in the back because a dog ran across the road. - [Man] I'm sorry, I don't know how it happened. I'm sorry, sorry. - After all this, he says he's sorry. You see, it's his fault. - Sorry doesn't help. How are we going to get out of this mess? - It's your fault. If you'd kept the right distance, nothing would have happened. I stopped because a dog ran in front of me. Look at this pileup. - [Man] I'm sorry. (brakes screeching) (car crashing) - [Guido] There goes another one. Can't you put something down there, a danger sign? And there too, unless you want to open a butcher shop. More coming! - [Man] Anybody have a first aid kit? Somebody's hurt. - Somebody's hurt! Oh! - [Guido] Hey, ho! Where are you going? Come back! I said to stay in the car! Ah, the police. - [Anita] Let me through. - [Guido] Right on time. - [Anita] Who's hurt? Let me through. - [Police Officer] Check things out there. - [Guido] Officer. (motorcycle revving) - [Police Officer] Well, what's going on? - How do I know? This man brakes too sharp, and I have to swerve. - I didn't have the time! The man in front of me slammed his brakes on. - Sorry. But I stopped short because that fellow did. - I stopped short? He did it first. - I had to act fast because of the emergency. - Somebody's going to pay! Oh, my poor head. Who gave a license to that man? No, I want to, I've got to find out who he is. I'll find out, and I'll kill the bastard. - The hospital at Orbetello. - Just forget about me. Get your filthy shoes off the seat, will you? - [Injured Man] What's that? - [Man] We'll take care of you. We'll be at the hospital soon. (car engine revving) - Some mess you caused. - Who, me? - Who else, with that stupid trick you did with my watch. And then who told you to put this big faker in my car? - What? - It's not your business. - What was I supposed to do, let him die? - Yeah, die, die, die. It's not so easy to die, believe me. And then who cares about him? This guy, he's only thinking about the insurance money. - Well, it's your fault that he's here in the first place. - My fault? It's your fault! - It's your fault! - It's your fault! - It's your fault! (brakes screeching) What are you doing? - [Injured Man] What about the hospital? - [Anita] Come back here! - Now I got whiplash. The hospital, huh? - Come back! - Now my leg hurts! - [Guido] Listen, you've been on my back ever since we left. Cats, commercials, watches, cops, and you don't even like sex! - Oh, here we go again, right? - Yeah, here we go again. And now you want to play Salvation Army with this liar who's messing up my car! - Hey! - What the hell do you want, you? - I want to go to the hospital! - You'll be at the hospital when I get you there. If you don't like it, get out and start walking. - No! Take me to the hospital now. Otherwise I'm going to sue you too! I'll tell all about how you treat the little lady here. (car door slamming) (tires squealing) - I don't know what came over me when I decided to take you with me. - Look, don't do me any favors. There must be a train station where we're going. - You bet there is. - Well, just get me there. I'll take the next train back to Rome. We'll both be better off. - Absolutely. (car horn honking) An injured man here. - Stretcher here! Injury case arriving. - [Anita] An accident on the highway. Hurry! - [Police Officer] Run him over, did you? - [Guido] Me? - [Police Officer] Your papers, please. - Look, I didn't run over anybody. In the first place, you can ask him yourself. He's right here. Hey, wait a minute. Tell the officer here how you happened to get hurt. - [Injured Man] I don't know anything and I can't remember a thing. - Hey, wait! Listen here. Excuse me, but didn't you run right into a great big car with your little pickup? - I don't know anything and I can't remember a thing! - Well, I'll be damned. - [Police Officer] Your papers, please. And wait here. You too, signorina. Stay here. - Here's my license, but I had nothing to do with it. I just offered the use of my car to the police. Take all the information you want, but I have a serious problem. Somehow I must get to Rosignano, where my poor father has been mortally ill. We're in a hurry, right? - Right. - You see? - [Police Officer] I'm sorry, but I can't let you go until the arrival of the highway police. If they confirm your story, you can go. - [Guido] But not even when I tell you my father, it's an emergency. Okay, how long will it take? - [Police Officer] Depends. Measuring, photos, depositions, a couple of hours. Now will you move your car and put it back there in the courtyard? - Right. (car engine starting) (tires squealing) (car door slamming) See what happens when you do a good deed? - What'd you tell him? - I told him that my father is dying. - What? Your father's dying? Why didn't you tell me? Why did you lead me to believe that you-- - No. I was only kidding. My father's fine. That was only to get us out of here. Normally it's a story that always works. Anyway, don't move. Stay here. You'll catch a train, don't worry. - Your number in Rome is ready please, signore. (phone ringing) - Hello? - Guido. - Hello, Elisa. - [Elisa] The operator said you were in a hospital. - Well, yes, but nothing is wrong. I'm perfectly okay, don't worry. There was an accident on the way, and they asked me to help the injured. I'm going to be delayed. - [Elisa] Does the family know? - That's why I'm calling. Call them. Call Rosigniano. - I sp-- - Eh? - I said...to them. - What? - [Elisa] I spoke to them after I called the bank. Just try to hurry, that's all. - No, tell me what's the matter. How is he? What's happening? - [Elisa] How can he be? Oriana says so-so, stable. - Come on, stable or so-so? - [Elisa] Guido, they're the same thing. - Well, that's better. At least he's no worse. All right, so you call them again and explain that I'll arrive tonight, as early as possible. It doesn't depend on me and explain everything, eh? - [Elisa] Yes. - I'll call you, ciao. - Ciao. - [Guido] How much, signorina? - 1,200 lire. - Ah yes, would you know what time the next train to Rome is? - At 1:40. In about a quarter of an hour. - And after? - You'll have to wait till tonight. - Ah. Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. (motorcyle motor running) Not bad. You got here pretty fast. - Nobody put up any arguments. The Dutch gentleman admitted it was his fault. He's certainly not Italian. - That's what I told you. I can go now, all right? - Yes, yes, you're in the clear. Ah, your papers. One second. - Okay. The young lady who was with me, have you seen her? - She went in there. - Oh, thanks. - [Man] Do we have to wait long? - [Police Officer] I don't know. I'll have to turn in my report, and then we'll see. - [Guido] Anita, what are you doing here? - We were both hungry. - [Guido] Oh, come on. (pans crashing) Excuse me, but... Come on, Anita. We'd better hurry. We have less than 15 minutes to get your train. - Tricky! Where's Tricky? Where'd he go? - He got scared with the noise of the plates. - Oh, here, kitty! - We needed that cat. - [Anita] Here, kitty, kitty, kitty! Meow. - Tricky. - [Anita] Meow. Here, kitty, kitty, kitty! - [Guido] Tricky! - Here, kitty. Oh. Here, kitty, kitty. Meow. (chirps) - Where the hell is it? - Here, kitty, kitty. - Tricky. (patients coughing) - [Anita] I found him. Let's go. Come on, let's go. - Too late. We'll miss it. - We still have 10 minutes. They told me the station was just around the corner. - [Guido] No. I told you, it's too late. No, wait a minute. Where are you going? - [Anita] Away. I'm going to Rome, back to Rome. - No, don't go. We can try again. Maybe things will go better. Huh? - You're funny. I don't know. This isn't a match made in heaven, you know. I mean, what made you change your mind all of a sudden? Are you crazy? - I am crazy. I'm crazy. Maybe. Why not? Come on, let's start again from the beginning. We just met, okay? No cars, no cops, no accidents. We'll go to the sea. We'll have the wind and the sun. To the Isle of Giglio, the Island of Lilies. Do you like the name? It's an enchanted place. Only an hour from here. In the middle of the sea. It's an ancient hideaway for fishermen, pirates, and lovers. (wind blowing) - Hm, you can draw. There's Tricky. - Don't you like it? (cat meowing) What's wrong? - That's just what I was thinking about. What's wrong. - What? - We don't get along. - We get along now. - There's something I haven't told you. You know what the problem is? You wanted Jennifer to be with you, and I wanted somebody else to be with me. - Ah. - You see, I work at the University of Chicago, where I met this Italian, an architect who teaches there part of the year. It was really hard on both of us when he left. Two weeks later, he calls me from Rome, and he asks me to come. So I buy this excursion-rate ticket, 14 days. I don't even know how I'm gonna pay for it. Anyway, I get there, and first day, he calls me, and second day, we have dinner. And the third day he tells me he has a wife and three kids, and to sit tight while he sends them to a resort so he can then be with me. I told him to go to hell. (laughs) You think that's funny? - No. No, it's not that. It's the old story. - Well, the worst of it is that he lied to me. - Come on. Use your head. Listen. Listen to me. Okay. We are both substitutes. But the truth is, I'm replacing a dummy, and you are a girl I don't give a damn about. Okay? It's not okay. Okay, now, maybe this combination is worse, but remember, you and I are going to an island, and we are going to be there alone. You and I together. I like that idea. And if you really want to know, the more I look at you, the more I like it. But if you don't feel the same way, fine. You don't have to go. Okay? - Okay. - Okay. Hey, look over there! Our island. Gigli. A lily in the middle of the sea. Listen, could you tell us so we could make plans, when do you serve your meals? - Meals, signore? The kitchen is closed. It's off season. - Off season, huh? Ah, off season they don't serve food. But it's better. We can get away from the hotel. We can eat out, hm? - There's no hot water in the room. - [Hotel Owner] There's no hot water. It's shut off. There's no hot water off season. - It's better, much better. Cold water is more stimulating. Eh? Come on. One thing, listen. Where could we find a car to see the island, a taxi? - A taxi, off season? - Ah, of course, off season. But it's better, much better. We'll walk. Good for us. Oh. Hey, come here. Look, look. (growls) (screams) Wonderful monster of the seven seas. Look, he never forgets a face. He's watching me. He's trying to remember where we met. You remember me. Hey, Jaws, who am I? I'm Moby Dick! Hey, ugly! - [Girl] Look out, signore! (screams) - What are you laughing at? Give me a handkerchief. Give me something. - He never forgets a face. (laughs) - Where's that yellow coward? Just a minute. I want to buy that filthy monster and eat him for lunch. He's gonna remember me forever. - No, you'll buy him and throw him back. He was just defending himself. - He almost blinded me just now, and I'm going to eat him. - No, okay, I'll buy him and throw him back. How much does he cost? - 5,000. - It's only money. Okay. 1,000, 4,000, and one more. Oh! You killed him! - Yes. Okay, let's have lunch. I must find a place that will cook it. Where's a restaurant? - You're looking for a restaurant here, off season? - And what do the natives do? They don't eat off season. - Out of season we don't bother with any tourists. The best thing is to try the castle on top of the mountain. They don't get tourists in summer, so they don't know what they're like. He might cook it. - About ready? - [Woman] Yes, almost. - Taste it. It can't bite me now. This octopus, he was tough when he was alive, but dead he's even worse. (laughs) - Ugh. - [Guido] It's you and me, eh? - Yes. - [Guido] Okay. We're going to destroy them. - Right. - Cigarette? - Gave 'em up. Remember, in the game we're playing, signals are permitted. They're part of the game. Don't forget. Jack, like this. Queen. King. Ace. You got it? - Got it. - Okay. It's your turn. Play. Hm? What kind of signal is that? - Hey, the rules say no speaking. You must only use signals. - Well, she's a beginner. She never played before. Hm? What have you got? It looks like you've got everything. Queen, ace, jack, another queen. What does it mean? What does it mean, going like this, winking and waving your head? - It means let's go. - When? - [Anteo] Hey, are we playing or talking? - Oh, excuse us. It has nothing to do with the cards. It's something personal. You mean now? Right away? Okay! - [Anteo] What's going on? - Sorry, a terribly important emergency that can't be postponed. - [Anteo] Nothing serious? - No, no. - [Anteo] Can we do anything? - No, it's a matter just between us. When's the next bus down? - Now. You've very little time. - Here, pay the check, Anteo. Thanks for the hospitality. Nice to meet you. - Ciao! - [Guido] Come on. - [Anteo] Hey, your octopus! - It's tough. Enjoy it! Stop! Hey, wait! Hey. When's the next bus down? - [Old Man] Nine o'clock tonight. - You mean we have to wait two and a half hours? - [Old Man] That's it, nine o'clock in the off season. - Is there a taxi? - A taxi. In the off season. Do you think this feeling can wait three hours? Or will it go away? - I don't know. - You don't? Well, let's analyze this. Was it the wine or are you suddenly mad about me? - I don't know. - Because if it's just the wine, in a half-hour it's over. - I think I can wait. - Risky. I don't think I can wait. (laughs) There. (bell ringing) (guitar music) - [Anita] How long till we get to Pisa? - [Guido] I don't know. It depends on the traffic. Why? - [Anita] Because I have to go to the bathroom, Guido. And I don't know if I can hold it. - [Guido] Okay. - [Anita] Where are we going? - [Guido] You'll see. We'll be there in a minute. (seagulls crying) - [Anita] Oh, this is like being on the moon. - [Guido] It's from that factory. They manufacture sodium bicarbonate. All the chemical waste goes into the sea. Look there. It takes the color out of everything. - [Anita] How did you find out about this place? - I was born near here. When we were kids, we used to come here during the summer. And my brother Omero almost drowned right over there. I want to show you... Where are you? Where did you go? Oh, that's right. - Ah. The water looks great for swimming. - [Guido] Early in the morning, before the factory starts, you can see right down to the bottom. - Uh-huh. - [Guido] Being here with you brings it all back. You know, I have two brothers and one sister, Oriana. - There are four kids in my family too, but we're all girls. - [Guido] And don't you miss them? And want to be with them? - [Anita] Sometimes, when I think about them. - [Guido] It's different with me. They're always on my mind. - That's interesting, since if I hadn't used the beach, we wouldn't have even come here. - You think so? I'm very close to my parents. Especially to my father. I owe him a lot. My family is very simple. They work hard. And me, if it weren't for them, right now I would be working right over there. My whole life spent in that factory. But I was lucky. - Lucky? - Yes. - How? - [Guido] I was lucky because the way things were at home, my father didn't have the money to send all three brothers to school. There was only enough for one. My father decided to leave it to chance. And so my mother put the three boys' names in a hat. - Why just the boys? What about your sister? - [Guido] I don't know, that's the way it was. But the point is that my father picked my name from the hat. - Maybe you weren't even the smartest. - You wouldn't say that if you met my brothers. But since then I feel that even though it's been a long time, I feel guilty about it. A sense of remorse. So I don't write them, I don't see them. It's as if they don't exist. - You just told me you can't stop thinking about them. - [Guido] Yes, I think about them, but I don't see them. And now that we're here I really want to. - [Anita] Well, what about me? - [Guido] We can get a nice room in a hotel in Cecina. It's very near Rosignano, the next town. - [Anita] And what about Pisa? - Pisa? Ah yes, Pisa. Tomorrow, in the morning. Now it's too late. It's a pretty good hotel in Cecina. You can eat lunch, take a rest, take a shower. I'll be back in two hours, okay? Oh, come on. It's only for a couple of hours. - Okay. - Thank you. Anyway, my father is living right over there, you understand. I can't be here and not say hello to him. We Italians are very close to our parents. Getting old. (cat meowing) - Wait a minute! - What, what is it? - [Anita] Where's Tricky? Oh, we can't leave without him. - [Guido] I'll be back as soon as I can. You just relax. (car engine revving) Hey, whoa. - [Donato] Hey, almost fell, signore. - Hey, you're Renato, and you're Antonietta. - [Donato] And who are you? - You know. Uncle Guido, from Rome. - [Donato] Then why don't you know my right name? It's Donato. - Ah. - Is that yours, that big car? - Yes, it's mine. Tell me, where are your folks? - They're all inside. They don't want us in there. (birds chirping) - [Omero] I'll go and get some cotton. - [Guido] Omero. - [Omero] Ah, Guido, you arrived. Come on, give us a hand. Oh, you arrived, huh? - [Cora] Ciao. - [Matteo] Pass me the shirt. - When did it happen? - [Matteo] About half an hour ago. - [Guido] Did he realize it? - Who knows what he realized? The last two days he didn't speak at all. - But he could see all right. (phone ringing) - Hello? - [Gambutti] Can I speak to Don Armando? - [Oriana] Drink this, it's good for you. - Oriana, somebody wants papa. - Well, tell him. - Who's speaking? - [Gambutti] This is Signore Gambutti. Is Don Armando there? - No. Papa is gone. - [Garbutti] What do you mean gone? Won't he be back for supper? - No, not anymore. - [Garbutti] Can I leave a message? - I'm telling you he's dead, understand me? - [Adalina] Who was that? - [Oriana] I don't know. One of his friends, I guess. - Are they going to put on his blue suit or the gray one? - Blue, mama, blue. - I'll fix you a coffee. - Don't bother, mama, I'll do it. - No. - [Oriana] We expected you yesterday. What made you so late? - It wasn't my fault. Yesterday was a tragedy for me. Didn't Elisa call and tell you about it? I just missed being arrested. And papa, I really wasn't all that upset when I heard. Saying his condition was stable, and Oriana a trained nurse. - Oh, he was stable. His suffering never stopped. I'll get the children back to the house. - His tie. I hope they used the maroon. - [Guido] His tie. - [Cora] Guido, is that your cat? - Ah, the cat. No, mama, I don't know which tie. What cat? What cat? - Well, this one here. The kids said they found it in your car. - He was sleeping under the seat. - I must say, I don't know how it got there. I guess it's a stray cat. - You see, mama? We're able to keep it. - No, absolutely not. It could be sick. Why don't you throw it nextdoor in the neighbor's garden? Go on. - What neighbor? It's not sick, no. If they like the cat, let them play. Go on, children, play with it. - All right, all right. Come on. You still have your homework for tomorrow. - [Donato] You mean you have to go to school when your grandfather dies? - [Cora] You think it's a holiday? - [Guido] Make sure he doesn't run away, Donato! - [Donato] Don't worry, Uncle Guido. (guitar music) (phone buzzing) - Guido? - [Guido] Yes. - Is Tricky with you? - Tricky? Ah yes, Tricky. He was in the car. But he's fine, don't worry. - Listen, I'm almost ready. How much longer will you be? - That's why I'm calling you. I can't come right away. You know, my family's so excited to see me, and it's been a long time, I told you. It's a big deal for my mother, of course. All my cousins and their wives, all my relatives are coming, my friends. There's a big dinner. They're depending on me. I can't come right away. What can I do? Anita? Ho! Can you hear me? Anita. Anita! - Yes, I can hear you. - Then answer me. - What am I supposed to say? I understand. You're not coming. - No, I did not say I'm not coming. I said I'll be late. I can't be sure how it goes, but maybe I'll phone you again later. - Oh, it's okay. It's all right. - [Guido] I'm sorry, Anita. I guess going back home was a bad idea. Ciao. (sighs) (phone ringing) - Operator. - [Anita] Can I talk to the front desk, please? - Of course, miss. - Oh, let me talk to you. Never mind, then. I don't need the front desk. Maybe you can help me. Is there a movie theater around here? - Mm-hm. There is one near the station, and they're showing Gone With the Wind. - Oh no. I just saw that for the 10th time. - After that, you have the Cristallo. But they're running Porno Nights Number Two. I don't know if you're interested. - Absolutely. After missing Number One, I'd never forgive myself. (laughing) On the other hand, I have nothing else to do. It's better than nothing. - You're going by yourself? - I have no choice. - [Operator] How old are you? - 28, why? - Well, alone, 28, a foreigner. There'd be a hand resting on your seat before you sit down. - That would be interesting. Oh damn, what am I gonna do? I don't feel like hanging out in this dump all night. - Listen, I'm free tonight. If you like, we could go together. Two is better than one in case we have to face a guy. What I mean is, if we decide to-- - It's a date. - [Omero] Ah, Guido, we ate supper already. Take a look in the kitchen and see if there's something left. - [Guido] No, thanks. I'm not hungry. - [Matteo] You got yourself some air, eh? - You want anything? - [Guido] No, no thanks. - A little coffee? - [Guido] No, thanks. And mama? - Upstairs. - Asleep? - No, she waited up for you. And you Don Atilio, how about a coffee, eh? - Ah, Guido, you recall Don Atilio, a good friend of poor papa's. - Ah yes, a pleasure. How are you? - Over 40 years we were friends. In and out of the factory. - Telephoning the family, I've done it. Also the ones in Volterra. The death certificate's filed. The people from the funeral parlor come tomorrow. How about the priest? - [Matteo] He's all set. - Ah, I forgot to telephone Elisa. - [Oriana] Oh, she called to speak to you. I gave her all the news here. But if you want to call her yourself. - No, no. Why bother? - [Atilio] If it's no trouble, I'll sit with him a little longer. - [Cora] I'm going back home. - He always preferred this rifle, poor papa. I want you to take it. As a remembrance. - That's Omero's favorite too. It's meant for him. Papa gave his promise. - Oh? When? - Oh well, I don't recall exactly when it was. - I remember when. Two years ago last May, when you and he went hunting in Capalbio. What's wrong, mama? Why give a rifle as good as that to somebody who's never gone hunting in his life? I think if he wants something of papa's, let him take his trumpet. All his life he would play it, but why that rifle, cost him more than a million lire, should be Guido's, whose education was paid for just because he was lucky? How long must the other two remain second-class citizens? - Stop this now, Cora. Among us it's better not to talk of these things. Go home, go on, go to bed. The children are all alone in the house too. Go on. - Come on, mama. Try to sleep a little. Tomorrow's going to be difficult. - [Adalina] Yes, but papa is upstairs. He shouldn't stay alone. - Don't worry about it, mama. For now there's Don Atilio. After that, we'll be here. - Come on, I'll make the-- - No. I want Guido to take me. - Sure. Where? - In my room. - Hold this, huh? Goodnight, mama. - Guido, don't you listen to what they say. That rifle is yours, and no one can touch it. - [Guido] The rifle, mama, but why? - Because I want to. And because it wasn't just luck that sent you to school. I sent you because you were the brightest one, and because I wanted you to go. - [Guido] What are you trying to say? - Nobody ever knew this, Guido. Not even poor papa. But now that he's passed away, I have to tell. It's so long ago. Listen, I wrote the names on three slips, and then I put them in a hat. And on each slip I wrote only Guido. - [Guido] Why, mama? For God's sake, why? - Because you were the most intelligent, the most refined, and the most gentle. - [Guido] Well, goodnight, mama. - [Adalina] Goodnight. - How do you suppose they choose the actors for these films? - Well, certainly not on talent. - Exactly. Or looks. They pay them for enjoying it. (laughing) - I've always wanted to know how they find these guys. - Through newspaper ads. Like help wanted, marchers. Or they have talent scouts. So you see? I missed my calling. - [Anita] I'd better see if Guido called. - Okay, let's go somewhere for a bite. I'm starving. - Oh, the phone is free. Listen, I'll go make my call. - No, no, no, no, no. You stay here. I'll call. If he's there, I'll put you on. Listen, meantime you can tell the gentleman why you are alone here. What's his name? - [Anita] Massacesi, Guido. - [Operator] I see, I'll call the hotel. - You don't have to explain anything. I'm Tonino. - [Anita] Hi. - It's my truck outside this place. You're not Italian, huh? - I'm American. - Ah, American. I have a cousin in America. He lives in, um, I forget the name. Where are you from? - Smog City. - Ah, that's it, Smog City. - Yeah? - Yeah! (laughs) Maybe you know him. - I doubt it. There is no Smog City. - That's all right. I don't know my cousin either. - You're very funny, Tonino. - [Tonino] What's an American doing in Cecina? - Just passing through. I'm on my way to Pisa. - I can take you there. Any afternoon you like. My truck's always parked outside. - No thanks, it's okay. - Of course. You don't want to go riding, how about going dancing? - Well, I'm very tired, and I'm gonna go back and go to sleep. - Oh. Well, tomorrow, then. I'll be here all day. If you want to go to Pisa, I'd like to drive you there. - No, really. I came to Cecina with someone, and it's not a relative. - Okay. Well, I'm sure you're having a good trip. Goodnight. - Thank you. The bill, please. - No, let me, please. It's my pleasure. Mario! - [Mario] Yes? - Put it on mine, all right? - [Mario] Okay. - Oh. - Let me do this, at least. - [Anita] Thanks. - I'm still hungry. - [Mario] Try this. - There we are. Bread, bread. - [Mario] Here. - Nothing. He didn't come, no phone calls. - [Anita] Oh. - Well, anyway, I left a message for him. Shall we go? - Okay, yeah. Bye. (phone ringing) - Park Hotel. - Hello. - Morning, sir. - Yes, I'm calling Signorina Watson. - I'm sorry, please talk louder. - I can't, because I have a very bad throat. Signorina Watson. - Ah, Signor Massacesi. Anita's not up yet, because we had a late night. No, no, no, I ring immediately. Hold the line. - No, no, no, I really don't think you should wake her. - [Operator] But she said the minute you called, I should wake her. - Yes, but honestly, it's not important. And so if you'll be kind enough to tell her when she wakes, could you tell her that I'm running a bit late, but I'll get there immediately, and I'll bring along her kitten. Thank you. - Signore. - Yes? - There's a lady who wants to speak to you. - [Guido] A lady? - Yes, she's down that way. - You're looking for me? - Yes. Forgive me. You're Guido, the son who lives in Rome? - Well, yes. - Hm. I worked up my nerve to speak to you. Because with the others, I'm ashamed. But since you had the chance to study, to see new ways, maybe you can understand me. Armando, your father, always talked about you. It was serious with us. 18 years. 18 years is a lifetime. I want to see him. Please, let me see him. - Do my two brothers know? - They knew. - Very well. You'd better wait. I'll see what I can do. - [Oriana] Come along, mama, and I'll fix up your hair. I can't bear it when it's messy like that. - Listen, mama, do you think she ever knew? - I doubt it. Papa was clever. - But 18 years. To manage that long. - Mm-hm. It didn't take much. He'd fake a reason to go out hunting. He'd get up at four in the morning, he'd pick up his rifle, and slip right into the other lady's bed. (hums) - You know who she is? - Her name is Noemi, the lunchroom cashier. - Married? - No. No, no, no, no, no. She's still single. Also, I feel she never married, maybe because of papa. - Mm. - But when she was a young girl, she was a pretty number. I'd have been happy to play around with that a bit. - Thanks. - You're welcome. - Still no word? - No. - [Anita] Now, tell me what he said again? - To let you sleep in till he came. - But that was hours ago! What does he think he's doing? Listen, would you mind? Did you look up his number for me in the phone book? - There are 11. The Massacesis are all over town. I'll call them all for you. - Thank you. - The cheapest would be this one. But it's entirely plain. No decorations, no glass sides. Only one driver. 148,000 and sales tax flat. - Boys, listen, I'll tell you the truth. A funeral like that is really very depressing, huh? - [Oriana] Guido. - Huh? - [Oriana] A call for you. - Who is it? - [Oriana] Signorina Watson? - Ah. It's the bank in Rome. The foreign division. Sorry. - A funeral is a one-time-- - Yes, yes it is. What can I do for you? - What can I? You tell me! You drop me here yesterday, disappear without a trace. - No, no, listen. I called you, but you were sleeping. I couldn't get back last night. It happened that my mother was-- - Are you coming or not? - No, no, I can't now. Maybe later. I apologize-- - All right, listen to this. I'm gonna get a cab, come pick up my cat, and go back to Rome. - Wait a minute, just a moment. Dammit to hell, I'll go crazy. - Guido! - Yes! - Please get back here. We have to decide on this. - Yes, well, if it's up to me, I decided already. The blue hearse, lots of flowers, death notices all over town. I'll pay for the extras. Now I'm going for a breath of air. My head is bursting. - He needs air. (car engine running) Anita! (car tires squealing) (horns honking) (horn honking) - [Anita] Keep going, go faster. (horn honking) (brakes squealing) - [Cab Driver] Hey, what's he doing? He's crazy! (tires squealing) Hey! - [Guido] Get out. - [Anita] Where's my cat? - [Guido] I told you, in my house. Get out. (car door slamming) Get out. - Ooh, ow! - Get out! - I will not! - Come on! - Let go of me! - [Guido] What are you, crazy? - I'm gonna get my cat and get outta here! What are you doing? What gives you the right to push me around? Because you ignore me and leave me to rot in some dump? I've had enough. Let go. Let go. - Ow! You bitch! (screams) - [Anita] Let go of me! - [Guido] Come here! (screams) - [Anita] Let me go! (screams) Help! Let me go! - You're coming with me! - [Anita] Let me go! What do you think you can leave me to rot in some fleabag? Well, you just forget it. - [Guido] Shut up a minute! - Ow! - Now, you stay there! Let me talk to you! I told you over and over I couldn't make it. I told you that I couldn't. - What do you think I am, some little dog of yours? Somebody who'd like to sit around and wait? You're wrong. I came here to have fun, and I'm gonna have fun if it kills me. - I told you that I couldn't come. - You could have if you wanted to. - Let everybody and everything go to hell. Good evening, how are you, ladies and gentlemen? Keep smiling. Is everybody happy? - Yes. - Ooh, pretty girl. Do you like the risotto? - Mm, delicious. I have to learn how to make it before I go back to the States. - The States? When is that? - Friday. I told you. - Two days from now. What's there for you in America? Don't you like it here? - I do now. - You want some more? - Yes, I'm starving. - You're always starving. Waiter, is there any risotto left? - Certainly, sir. - Then bring another two portions. - Right away. - No, I'll do it myself. - Thank you. - Got a cigarette? - Mm-hm. You're a smoker? - I used to smoke. Then I stopped. Three years ago. - Was it bothering you? - Yeah, but who gives a damn? - Oh! (Anita screams) There, save it. It'll bring you luck. And love, maybe. - Ah, my souvenirs. A cork, a cat, and a caricature. - You have to stay here. See what a good time we have together? I don't want you to leave. I want you to stay. There are so many things we can do together. And then... Listen, excuse me, but could you stop beating time like that? - Talkin' to me? - That's right. It happens to be annoying. - With all of the noise going on in this place, that annoys you? - Yes, it does. Thanks. Listen, I'm almost 40. Maybe my life is a mistake, my work nothing. I want to throw everything away for you, to begin again, but I can't unless you-- - [Anita] Oh! Guido! (glass breaking) (disco music) (guitar music) Guido? What's the matter? Why? I don't understand. - It's nothing. Everything's fine. Come here to me. (bell ringing) Listen, if the lady asks for me, the one in number 28, no matter what time it is, say I've just left. - Of course, signor. - All right, here, thanks. And don't forget, whenever she asks. - [Porter] Don't you worry. - [Guido] Thanks again. (phone ringing) - Yes? - Excuse me, have you seen Mr. Massacesi? - Yes, signorina. He was right here. Oh, no, no, he just left, signorina. Just this minute. - Thank you. Excuse me. Excuse me! - Yes, signorina? - What is that big poster there? The one that says Massacesi on it? - Ah, it's a death notice. An announcement. It's traditional here. When someone dies, they are put up all around the city. - Would you mind reading it for me, please? - Yes. After a long suffering, Armando Massacesi expired Tuesday, April 11th, in the presence of his beloved wife, Adalina, and his children, Guido and his wife Elisa, Omero and wife Cora, Matteo, and Oriana. Your prayers are requested. - Thanks. - [Porter] You're welcome, signorina. - Good morning. - Ciao. - Thank you. Thank you for coming. - Guido, Guido. - It was so sudden, wasn't it? - Yes. You know how these things are. - This must be the place. - Yeah, this is it. - [Guido] Thanks, thanks. Meow. Meow. Tricky. (cat meows) Ah, dammit! Damn that cat! (doorbell ringing) What are you doing here? What do you want? - I want my cat. - Ah, your cat. You're crazy, coming here like this. Even to ring the bell. - So why can't I ring the bell? - Listen, this cat is an obsession of yours. It's a mania. Look, here he is, your damn cat. I was going to bring it right now to my car, then take care of a few little things, and come back to you. - What little things? - Anita, look, please, go to the hotel and wait for me there. Please. - Hello, Elisa. - [Elisa] Hello. - [Woman] It's Guido's wife. - [Omero] Elisa has arrived. - [Matteo] Hello, Elisa. - No, wait. No, not now. - Hm, you are acting very strange. - Why? I'm perfectly normal. - You wouldn't be hiding something from me, would you? - No, I'm only afraid that somebody could come and find you here. - [Anita] Oh, well then, I'd better go. - [Guido] No, no. - Well, so this is the house you grew up in. - Oh, yes. - Would you like to take me on a tour? - No, there's not much to see. This is the dining room. The kitchen. A couple of bedrooms upstairs. Where are you going? Anita, where are you going? - [Anita] I wanna see. - [Guido] Come back here. - This must be your parents' room. - [Guido] Yes, yes. - And this is the room you shared with your brother when you were kids. - [Guido] Yes, you see? They left it just as it was. - They didn't even make the beds. And is this the bed you were born in? - No, I was born in the hospital. It was a very difficult birth. - Where is everybody? - My mother is shopping, my brothers are working, and my sister goes around giving injections. She's a nurse. - What about your father? - My father? He's hunting. He loves to hunt. - There's a funeral. - Yes. That's what I had to do. To go there. He was a close neighbor. - You were a cute kid. - Come on, Anita, let's go. - But you're much cuter now. - No, that's enough. - Yeah, you're much better looking. Much better looking now. - Come on. What do you think you're doing? - What's the matter, Guido? Aren't you in the mood? - [Guido] If you are, I am. - Maybe I can still be useful in helping you forget your father's death. That's what you've been using me for all along, isn't it? - And you think that's nothing? (slaps) - You didn't have to hide it. - Who is that woman leaving my house? - Guido's coming out too. - [Guido] Anita. - [Anita] Come on, Tonino. - Hey, didn't you hear? She said come on, Tonino. - And I say get the hell off my back, Tonino. - Come on, you, get out of here. Go on! - [Anita] Let's go. - Oh my God. - It's Guido. Come on, run, run! - [Guido] Out of my way, you. - [Omero] Guido! - [Guido] Get out of that truck! - [Anita] I'm staying right here. Go away. - [Guido] I need you, you know it! - [Anita] Need me? You've been pushing me around for three days! - [Omero] You've brought her from Rome? - [Guido] You too. Get away, Teo. - [Anita] Tonino, let's get going. - [Guido] Anita! - [Omero] Who the hell is she? - [Guido] Let me go, will you? You didn't understand a goddamn thing, Anita. - Guido, have some respect for papa. You should be ashamed, you're disgusting. - You have to bring that foreign slut here. We'll settle this later. Be quiet now. There's papa to think of. - [Guido] All right, all right. - Your wife's here too. (priest praying in Italian) - Who was that woman? Tell me. - Some slut he brought here from Rome. Those Delancio. - It's a prostitute. - He brought a prostitute? Prostitute. - What did you say? Are you sure? - I tell you, he's a bastard! - What's going on? - Nothing. - I want to hear it from you. Is it true? - Oh, very true, very true. - Aren't you ashamed of yourself? - No, no. Actually, I feel I'm free at last. Ha ha ha. - Coming here and making my house into a bordello. - Ah, no. I tried to. - If your poor father only knew. - He wouldn't have said a word, since he had a mistress for 18 years without any fuss. - What did you say? - Do you want to see her? She's behind us, right next to Don Atilio. With dark glasses. Go on, look. - It couldn't be. - No? Then better ask your husband. He knew all about it. - Is it true? For 18 years you helped your father keep his secret? - Huh? - Don't pretend you don't know. - Tell me what's happening. Nobody talks to me. Nobody tells me what's going on. - What's happening, mama, is that your Omero is a pig. A deceitful pig! - [Priest] Oh dear Lord! - No, Cora, don't talk like that. Omero never said anything because he didn't want me to be hurt. But I knew from the first time it happened. Poor Armando had a young mistress on the side. - You satisfied now? You humiliate mama in everyone's eyes. You washed papa's dirty linen in public. It's funny to you. - And who began the whole thing? You're breaking my head about things that don't concern you. For what? - Please, my son. - And when you arrive to bury our papa with a tramp on your arm that's not our concern, but how could you do something like that? - [Guido] Very easily. The way you do abortions. - [Oriana] Me? I've only done one. For a friend. - [Guido] Do as many as you want. But don't judge others. - Better stop worrying about others and start worrying about yourself, huh? That's disgusting. To profit from the death of papa to have yourself a vacation. - [Adalina] Omera. - Even your kids wanted a vacation. - They're only babies, not a sex maniac like you. - Oh, oh, oh, oh! - There you are. That's the thanks that's coming to us after all we did for so many years. - [Matteo] And so many sacrifices so that he could study. - Lady Luck was blind when she chose Guido. - Ah, no. She saw very well. To prove it, all you have to do is ask mama. Explain it, mama. The business of the slips in the hat. Who you wrote down, who you didn't write down. You ask her, because I'm fed up with your breaking my head. - Oh my God. - What does that mean? What the hell is this about this-- - [Matteo] Just don't walk away, huh? - [Adalina] What do you say? What do I have to explain? It's only because I'm a mother. - [Omero] That's what they call it, mama? Huh? (train whistle blowing) (family arguing) (train running) (upbeat music)
