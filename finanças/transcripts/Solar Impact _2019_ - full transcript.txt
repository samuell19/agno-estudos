Astrophysicists are reporting that intense electro magnetic storms on the sun have triggered deep fissures and enormous eruptions violently blasting solar matter into space. Thousands of times more powerful than has ever been detected. The solar debris has pierced the Earth's magnetic field and ozone layer and caused widespread destruction. Human exposure to the vast amounts of solar radiation has resulted in alarming DNA cellular mutations. Response by the police and military around the world have been dissipating as the effects of the radioactivity have been spreading beyond any conceivable rate. It's imperative to avoid all human interaction including physical contact with friends or family members who might of been contaminated. Symptoms include dark bloodshot eyes, protruding veins, unusually aggressive behavior and an insatiable craving to attack and feed on other people. I don't have a spare. Look clearly nobody wants to talk about what's happening. Yeah I don't want to talk about it. We all saw what happened. Gabe! Get out, get out, get out!

I just, I couldn't bring myself to, you know. You should've said something. We just met. Didn't seem the right time. So what happens when that thing decides to attack us? That thing is my wife. That's not your wife anymore. Too dangerous to keep her here. I'm not gonna kill my wife. You're so young, so naive, so quick to judge. Have you even thought about a possible cure? No, you're too busy killing. You're murdering these people. Owen you've killed, we saw you. In self defense. Eddie was my neighbor for over 20 years.
