See, she's lying. I told you. Game's over. Time to go back. - Robbie, please don't take us. - Please don't take us. - Where're the others? - It's just us. The others disappeared last night. A system of cells interlinked within cells interlinked within cells interlinked and dreadfully distinct against the dark, a tall white fountain played. Cells, do they ever keep you in an institution cell itself? I'm here. I'm ready. Let's start. Dr. Harrison will be here shortly, Sawyer. Personal space, Robbie. Guess the joke. They won't even let me have my phone in here. No. - I'm serious. - Yeah. Probably wondering why I called you all here? I lowkey have top secret intelligence for you. We got a Freaks and Geeks reunion going over here? Wow! Meathead, you can finally speak in complete sentences. - Shove it, man. - What do you guys call a football player with half a brain? What? Gifted. Hey. It's okay. Just ignore her. - Him. - What? Him. You meant to say, just ignore him. - Whatever. - You have a serious pronoun problem, don't you, princess? Leave her alone, Kai. No fucking way. Did she give you a hand job in the security closet and now all of a sudden you have to act all protective and shit? Guys, the rules clearly state we're not supposed to be in the group therapy session until a licensed psychologist is present. - Okay. - Except during the ten step. - She's being a bitch. - It's okay. Sweetheart, no one knows the ten step and I'm really afraid they don't care about the ten step. Robbie, no one's following the rules. Yeah, Robbie. Get shit together, man. You lose control... No, that's not true. I have everything under control. Enough! Quiet down! - Quiet! - Hey, hey, hey! Show some respect for the director. That's enough out of you, Kylie. And boom dead named. So, it appears someone tried to escape this morning. But no one wants to tell me - who the culprit was. - Did they succeed? Sawyer, if you don't have any info to share, just stay out of it. Thank you, sir. I'd very much like to be excluded from this narrative. We all know who it was. - Do we? - I do. And let me be clear. You will never get out of here. Why, I do know to get you peeved or is it just the fact that I exist that pisses you off? You all seem to forget that this program is an alternate to a mental hospital. I need you to shape up, or everyone, everyone... will lose their privileges. And that goes double for you, Kylie. Am I interrupting? Not at all, Dr. Harrison. I'm just laying some ground rules to balance out your coddling of our kids. Bedlam is all yours. Did I miss something? Uh, you just may have exasperated the director's transmisogynistic M words. Oh, Aspen, maybe you can go and kiss and make up for us. That's disgusting. Kai, by not taking this seriously, you only hurt yourself. Very well. It's your life. Is it? Remember our mantra. Progress, not perfection. I can't help you guys if you don't share your feelings with me. Yeah, it's just... you see, Dr. H, I prefer brain fucking in my bedroom. You know, we will just follow you and continue therapy in your room. You know what, fine. It's more aesthetic in there anyway. Come on. I hate the way they make me feel. The way they take control of me. It'll be very bad to go off your medication even for a day or two, Theo. - Hey. - I got to get out of here. Let me guess, you don't belong in here? No one does. Except Aspen. She actually checked herself in last week, so technically she can leave at any time. So, you got a free pass? Yes. But I chose to check myself in here to deal with my anxiety and depression. I'm sure chasing all those likes and followers must have been very mentally taxing. Look, I needed to unplug, so, yeah, I guess it was. What a great alternative from your adoring fans, your sponsor payments. - I can't even imagine that pain. - Look, Kai. You don't know anything about me or my pain, okay. And you act like you have everything figured out, but I think it's just a façade. No, I'm pretty transparent. - That's funny. - Is it? - Yeah. - Why is that? What is so fucking complicated about me, Aspen? - No, I don't want to talk. - No, tell me. Tell me what's so fucking complicated about me? Okay, alright. You know what, fine. You're just a tomboy with a chip on her shoulder who has no idea who she is. Did I get it? No, actually, you're just really shallow. Leave her alone. Why, isn't that cute. Blow me. Sorry, champ. Wrong type, wrong equipment. Fragged. I'm a boy. That doesn't like boys. Ergo not gay, got it? Yeah, yeah, sure. If any other guy talked to her the way you just fucking did, I would've knocked some fucking teeth out. Whatever. - Maybe I need a gender chichi. - Maybe you need a neuro-surgeon. Look, you're just as messed up as the rest of us, Kai. I think that this whole mental breakdown thing... is just another way for you to get attention. Not cool. We should be out there living life, I mean. When was the last time anyone of you had any fun? Don't you guys want to look back at this really miserable time? And have at least created one epic memory? I'm out. So, who's is in? Are you talking about breaking out? You're crazy. Sweetie, if crazy is wanting to live life without what ifs and if onlys? Fuck yeah, I'm sort of viable. Where are you gonna go? It's, um... it's a 48 hour rave. It's done once a year. And it's awesome. We dress up, we dance, we party, we... What, do you even have tickets or a hotel room? Let's not sort those details right now. Okay, well, this is ridicules. I just checked myself in here I'm not breaking back out. Live events aren't really my thing. I prefer televise events to be honest. Sorry. Oh, Kai, nobody wants to go with you. Look, man, I'm done. - Security's tight. - Yeah, for one person. We're not old team. I've never been to a rave before. Oh, no. No, no, no. I'm not going to split over here who's coming. - Come here. - No. Alright. What the hell! What's the play big shot? I got a plan. Oh! Hmm, that's a sugar rush. Hi. You're not supposed to be in here, pop tart. So, how are you ever going to breakout of your comfort zone if you can't even get out of bed? Your loss, sweetheart. Oh. Oh! - Oh, my God, you killed her! - I didn't kill her. She's going to wake up with a really bad headache. - Finally. Let's go. - No, no, no, wait. No, no, no. Just wait a second. - Are you serious? - Yeah. We're going to get caught standing out here with our dicks in our hands. We're not going to get caught. Alright, well, I hope you have a fast getaway car. I hope you have a getaway car. Alright, I didn't even think we're going to make it this far. - Are you serious? - Yeah, I'm serious. I have a bum ankle. This is a fucking joke. Look, come on, Levi. So, are we actually walking to the Dreamland, because, you know, I don't have the right shoes for that. Oh, God! We're a mother shi... You brought your phone? And the director's Zeus statute? - We don't have a getaway car. - Oh! Well, that's fine. I'll sort us lift. Okay. Looks like daddy cut off your credit card, huh. - So glum. - Look, I make my own money. I didn't think this will be so dangerous. Abort! Abort! You losers need a lift? Let's go. Je... what the! How long has that been back here? You know, you're lucky Levi decided to use van or you would've been left here. - You invited it? - Yeah. You do realize I got to come for us sooner or later? Well, yeah, we're only still in the handicapped van. Actually, you're dumb-ass. Dreamland or bust! And this is our guide. Oh, God, I can't believe I did it! Oh, we're doing this. No more "what ifs" or "if onlys". Travelling on back rows is statistically far more challenging for nonenforcement track vehicles. Sawyer, you're such as David. Finally! Yes! Dr. Stratton? Dr. Stratton! Sir? Did you get any of my texts last night? Anything at all? I sent you like 20 texts. They're gone. They've escaped. Who escaped? Uh, Kai, Levi, Sawyer, Aspen and Theo are all missing. Kylie's behind this escapade. Aspen too? Yes, and Aspen. And they took the van. Should I file a police report? What? No. We keep this inhouse. Right, like always. No, not like always, Robbie. They're not on foot. They took a Goddamn van. Alright, we have to think quick. We expand our net, choke off their resources. Take two attendants and start the search. Um, widen your perimeter if you have to by miles and find them. Do not engage, you understand? Call me. Do you understand me, Robbie? Yes, sir. Oh, and Robbie. - I didn't get any text or calls - Sir, I swear... Do not... lie to me again ever. And fucking fire the two fucks who fucked on my fucking couch! Yes, sir. What the fuck! Are your parents siblings? - You fell asleep, pigskin. - Yeah, we all did, ass wipe. I see that, but you were driving, dipstick. Yeah, you all fell asleep on me, and my ankle was killing me, so, yes, I pulled over. What of it! No, I like red liquorish. Oh. And orange soda. I don't have either. This is what I imagined freedom looks like. Alright. We gone. Well! You all look like you all going to Dreamland. Aren't you? Well, you've come to the right place my lovelies. I'm Nova Charise. So... who are you? Fashion is freedom, sweeties. Style is the way to say, "This is me" without speaking. So, I say, you show the world who you are with what you wear. So, how many selfies do you need in one outfit? Clearly, one more. Oh! I... Ten out of ten, girl. Now, I cannot say the same for the rest of you all. But you just let Nova Charise spice you outcast up. No. You don't like being touched? No. I feel you. I will respect your space, precious. You. No, no, you trust mama now. You're going to look hot. Now... listen to me. Listen to me my demoted band. Of Misfits. Do not dress the way that the world sees you, mm-hmm. You dress the way that you want to see the world. You be who you are with flair and without apology. You own it. This place is incredible. You have like everything here. Oh! Oh, my God! We're all mad here! I'm mad. You're mad. So, we're free to just put anything on, right? Just take stuff off the shelves and racks. - That's how it works, cutie. - Oh! Yeah! Drape yourself in velvet. To thine own self... - be true. - Oh, yes! Oh! Oh, my goodness! You look so good. Wait, I've to get this. - Wow! - I dig the letter. I love it so much. Wait, wait, wait! Stop the drag race. - Wow! - Oh. He looks like Jared Leto, right? Doesn't he look like Jared Leto? My gosh! He absolutely looks like Jared Leto. Wait, here. I'm not insane. I'm voluntarily indifferent to conventional rationality. Oh, my goodness! Levi, I have a surprise for you. - No. - Yeah, it's happening. Oh! Girl, you're going to look hot, hot, hot - like Steven Nixon ex. - Oh, my God, I love it! I'm going to try it in, okay. Holy shit! They fit. Oh, my God! We got take a group selfie. - Come on, group selfie. - Yes, come on, let's do it. Kai. Kai, come on. You have to create a memory, okay. - Yeah, bro. Do it for the mams. - Oh, God. Fine. Alright, yeah. Let's take a group picture. Yeah, okay. No. Uh, wait, wait. We have to do another one. Oh, God - What? - Theo's eyes were closed. - Yeah, sure they were. - Okay, that one's cute. - I like those. - Okay. - Oh! Oh, I love it. - Okay, wait. - You all ready to pay now, - honey bunny? - Yeah. When you go on a shopping spree and don't have any money. Relatable. Oh, no, no, no. Um, I don't have any money. Oh, does anybody have any money? Anyone? Okay. Well, um... we can't pay for any of this. Okay, we can't pay for all of this. Okay. Why did you bring me here? - Hey. - Why did you bring me here? Hey, you're good to go. Hey, you're good, buddy. Hey, look at me. Look at me. Okay, you're good, you're good. Look me in the eye, okay. Put your hand on your stomach. Put your hand on your stomach, Okay. Now, I'm going to put my hand on your chest and you're going to breathe in, really deep breath. I don't want to feel it in your chest. Just breathe in through your stomach. Okay? I'm on your chest. There you go, there you go. And then sigh like Aspen said something annoyingly narcistic. Yeah. You're good. Hey, you're good. You just had a little freak out - alright. You're good. - Yeah. You're good, champ. You know what? Don't worry about it. You don't need to pay. No, you don't have to do that. - It's okay. - It's on me, baby. Really. Really, you knock yourself out, all of you. It's taken all Thursdays. It's on the house. - We have to pay you. - Please, no I insist. Now, you just promise me... Now you go and dance your little tushes off for me when you get to Dreamland? Go on. Go on. Get out of here before I slap you all. Hey, guys. You can't have a proper road trip - without painting the van. - Oh, let me have this one. Go for it. I didn't know you're an artist. I'm full of surprises. Smoking is filthy. Approximately eight million people die from lung cancer annually. Dreamland or bust! Bitches! What the hell are you punks doing? Shit! Guys, go, go, go! Why're you running? Shit, shit, shit! You've had these the whole time? Yes! - That was insane! - Yahoo! - Oh! - Oh, my goodness! You got a light? Oh, hey, you have that dreamcatcher? Oh my gosh, yes. - Here. - Thank you. Oh, my God! It's so aesthetic. I love it. Wait. Where's my phone? Where's my phone? Where's my phone? - It should be right there. - Thank you, Kai. - Yeah. - Okay. Oh, my God. - Oh! Oh, Sawyer, crop circles. - Where? - Nowhere. - Kai. - Yo, let me drive. - I'm solid. - What about your ankle? - Don't worry about my ankle. Well, fuck! Now I'm confused. Is it your ankle or your brain that got sprained? Very clever. Oh, Aspen, you look so pretty. - And you look so happy, Theo. - It's just a picture. Oh, my! What's that quote? Edit your life frequently and ruthlessly cause it's your masterpiece after all. I don't need to edit my life. I need an entire franchise rebuilt. So, tell me. Why did you finally decide to come? I don't know. I guess, I didn't want to miss out. I'd like to think it was because of my irresistible charm. Oh, no, no. I'm plugging for real. Oh, Kai, give me my phone. - No, you can't go... - Thank you so much. You can't go five minutes without being plugged in. Serious addiction, dude. Look, we don't have any money, right? Or is there some secret statue buried cash in the desert that I don't know about. There's a secret statute of buried money? There's not a secret statute of buried money. I started a crowdfunding page for us. That's actually a brilliant idea. Bullshit. I figured we're going to need money for gas and a hotel room and VIP passes. Get your publicist or agent or whatever to hook us up. Or, are we now worthy enough for the tickets - into your livelihood? - Do we really embarrass you? No. no, no. I'm texting my publicist now. Okay, see. There we go. Still need food and a hotel room. And I'm talking five star treatment, okay. I want a luxury suite with top of the line room service. Oh, yeah, because I would never expect anything less. How are you going to pay for that, huh? She got a point, huh, shithead. But why would people give money to a sponsored social media celebrity who already has everything? That does seem kind of desperate even for you, Aspen. I mean, about this account with a fake cause, and my social media will just promote it, okay? Would just be mean endorsing the whole fans and hustle a lot of money. Well, you better turn off your GPS to your phone or this is going to be a very short trip. Look, Kai, I'm not an idiot. So, I'd appreciate it if you didn't treat me like one, okay? You can't fly until you get all the crap that weighs you down off your back, you know that, right? I'm very worried. Don't be. We'll find them. A few of them mentioned the Dreamland gathering this weekend. A drug and festive den. Kylie put them up to this. I'll see she never pulls a stunt like this again. Kai is struggling with some very personal issues. And imagine not feeling at home in your own body and no one accepts you for who you are. I understand. Gender identity disorder, Kristen. But frankly I don't care what mommy and daddy did to her as a child. I'm tired of shelving this issue, Rich. Yes, Kai committed a few minor crimes. But that kid doesn't belong here and we both know that. This is about feeling validated. Of course he's going to act out, who wouldn't? Please stop defending her. She insulted my staff and stole my van. Listen. I hear you, Kristen. Let's just table this until we get them back safely. Okay? So, I contacted Aspen's publicist and asked if she requested any tickets. She did. Five. Brilliant. You know what, I don't understand this. Why haven't we ever gone together? Maybe we should have a drink right now. Maybe we should call the police... now. I don't how much you care I would like it on the record that I requested and recommended we call the police. Noted. But I'm not going to do that. It's hard enough to fill the beds in here without the local news broadcasting that we're missing minors. We will get them back. I promise. Oh, sorry. I can come back later. No, no, no, not at all, don't. Come in, come in. Make yourself comfortable. Thanks for just letting me to talk. Okay. Will you excuse me, Dr. Harrison? Duty calls. Parental issues. We'll get that drink later. - Hi, Dawn. - Hi. Okay. Where were we? Gas station. That's destiny. I don't believe in destiny, faith or luck. I believe in science. Well, I believe in faith and that everything happens for a reason. Faith takes many possibility of choice. Is there evidence for some divine plan? We're just elementary particles pieced together by some massive crack on the universe. That's a really nice thought, Sawyer. We must have that crowdfunding cash. Let' see if this shithole has an ATM. That's not how it works. Yeah, we haven't made our reserve yet. But don't worry. I have it under control. I just refused to go for not five starring it all the way. So, we're still broke? Yeah, maybe a $20,000 was a little high. Twenty grand? What, it seemed like a good amount at that time. - Oh, yeah. - So, in other words we got nothing. Can't buy gas, can't buy food. We're stuck. Great. Oh, my God! - Can I get a pick? - Yeah. Oh, my God! I'm watching that. Excuse me, sir. Could I have some money? Could you buy us some alcohol? Me and my friends are looking for a good time. Want to come party with us instead? - What're you doing? - I'm getting the party started. Hey, where do you think those private place to give a hand job is? Aspen, you can't do advertise network out and then giveaway our location. And I can't go with these losers. Suit yourself. We have 20 on the platform. - Oh, shut up. - Could you also have some red liquorish and some orange soda, please? You could try getting a Goddamn job. This is the problem with you millennials. Your tick dick pics are free for all. Okay, listen. Whatever, she's gone, so it's fine. Man, you really just can't help yourself, can you? You always got to be the one on the driver seat You know what, you want to fucking psycho analyze me right now, let's go. Let me at least give you some fucking context so you know what you're talking about, okay. So, the old man, he had this thing that he used to drill into my head, that if you're not a leader, you're a failure. And at the top of my game and I'm not leader. And I jacked my ankle and all that's left is a failure. And these fuckers ban these fuckers. They give me this shit that's supposed to make me feel better, okay. And then they turn around and they take it from me. And they call me an addict like I can't control myself, like I'm some kind of monster and they lock me in this shithole with a bunch of freaks. I worked my entire life for that shit. And then, just gone like that. All of it. You see, I didn't have a backup plan. I lost everything. Lost my dream. My chance of going to college, my friends, my girl. My dad's respect. It's all fucking. You know what, yeah, yeah, go ahead and make your hilarious... sarcastic remark about the dumb jock failure that I am, but I can guarantee you my dad's already beat you to it, so. - I'm getting a bit mess. - What, did you steal that? My God! Go, go! Whoa! Hey! We're set. I'm so sorry gas station man! - Whoa! - Dreamland or Bust! - To Dreamland! - To Dreamland! Yes! Whoa! Alright. - Okay. - You just press those pretty little lips against the can and inhale. You're a brave girl. - You're good? You're good? - Yeah. It's all good. - Oh! - Oh. There you go. - May I? - Yeah. Thank you. Wow! That's some big shit. It's so obvious, dude. What? - Come on. - What? - Come on. - What's so obvious? Look, I'm going to keep it real with you, okay? I don't want you on this trip. I'll admit. You're a freaky little dude - and you make me uncomfortable. - Okay. But you're here. And she's here. Yeah. You know what I'm talking about. You think that's a coincidence? I don't think that's a coincidence. I know that's not a coincidence. That's fate. That's fate, little dude. I mean, what do I do? Do I just go over there? Yeah, that's exactly what you do. What do I say, like, I do... - You just... - I don't know what to do? You just say something, you say something personal. Chicks, they dig that sensitive guy shit. Uh, but don't get too personal. Because then you get creepy, you don't want to scare her off. - Okay. - Most importantly, let her talk. Yeah. There's one thing I know, chicks love to talk. You got this. - Yeah. - You got that. I don't even know - why I'm here. You got this. - Yeah, I got this. - You got this, hey. - Yeah. You got this. - Boom! - I do. - Sure, you got it. - Yeah. Hey. - Go get them, tiger. - Okay. Hey. Kind of freaked out at the clothing shop, didn't I? Yeah, I don't know what's wrong with me. I can't do anything right. You know, this is the first time I've ever been out of the house without my parents knowing where I am. I'm 17 and I still haven't got my driver's license. Not even my permit. I mean, my brother didn't even pass and he's super bright. I guess I'm nervous and afraid of failing. And afraid of actually driving too. I'm scared. Of taking the driving test or actually driving? Never mind. Do you know how many fans I have, guys? Literally, they're all fucking kind of obsessed with me. Millions. And millions of them. My dad said that relationships are dumb. And that friends are just energy sucking parasites that drain you. And you know, I should focus on more important things in the mall and social media. He said that hanging out with friends is ton amounts of wasting time, so I didn't have a lot of friends or people to talk to. Yeah, I wish I had more good friends. Instead, I just have these highs and lows. Makes it hard. Especially when you trolls recommend I kill myself. Hey. Sometimes don't you wish you were living someone else's life? Yeah. Yeah, literally anyone else's. That's why I like gaming. You know, you pick a game or tag and there's this... anonymity, you know. You're given a license to become anything. Anyone, you know, the nice guy suddenly becomes ruthless and powerful, you know. We always imagine that if we had a secret identity we'd want to be like Spiderman or Batman, but online your actions don't have consequences and given the chance, most people put on their mask and they don't become the hero. Well, they become the bad guy. Did you know that there're areas on Jupiter's moons Europa and Calissto that basically a hidden seas of water? It's a fact. Extraterrestrial life does exist. I know because they took me in. Right here in the desert. That's why I'm here. Because they promised me, if I ever came back, they'd take me back with them. Yeah, aliens are cool. Hey, come on. Stop being so anti-social. Come on. Come on. Sawyer, come on. Let's go. Oh shit! This is my jam. Hey, Theo! - Hi. - You're good, brave girl? Yeah. You know what, I have acne and bags, and I think I'm actually balding, so I'm doing fucking great. Thank you for asking. - Sit down. - Okay. Here, I think you're much of a pro right now. Hey, hey. You're okay. You're good. Alright? Just drip in all of it. Hey, what are you guys talking about? Just guy stuff. Hey, hey. Okay, go. Go. I can't. I can't. My ankle. - I got this jam. - Okay. Come on. No, you're not. I got you. Now me, now me. - Hey. - Hey. Fuck. Hey. Hi. What's going on? Come on, Kai, talk to me. Please tell me it's not that moment. You know, the moment were, oh, I'll share my wounds if you share yours. Thanks, but no. - I just needed a cigarette. - You're such a prick. That's what I do best. Why're you so mean all the time? Why do you care? Why does a rich, popular superstar like yourself... give a shit about what a tomboy with a chip on her shoulder who's totally confused about who she is thinks? Kai, that's not fair. I didn't mean that. - You know that. - But you did. And you do. So, go. Go have fun with Levi. He's dying to hook up and you don't want to keep your fan keep waiting now, do you? It's just a fling, okay. Why're you being like this? Because I'm in love with you. And I really know I shouldn't be. Yeah, I mean, that part was completely obvious. And? And I don't know. It's cool. You don't feel the same. God, I do. You do? Yeah, I mean... I mean, you have a cute smile and dreamy eyes and you're as sarcastic as fuck which I love. You make me laugh that I don't know... So, what's the problem? Look, I like you. Yeah, I really do, but this is not... I just can't imagine being with you. Fuck is this is so Goddamn confusing, Kai. You know that this is not easy. But it doesn't have to be complicated. I'm a guy like you said. I'm just a guy with a... a cute smile and dreamy eyes. I mean, it's all about what's on the inside, right? It's just about a girl who likes a guy. Not to me. And not physically anyway. I'm getting an operation. - And hormone that helps. - I'm sorry. That's just not... Yeah. Mm-hmm. Well, you know... I bet you'd be a lousy lay anyway. Detach to fortify your emotions. Boring. So, tell me, how do you like it then? Machinery with a selfie stick? The fuck you do. Fuck. Don't say that. Come on. Wake up! Why did I do that shit? Let's go. I'm hungry. Come on! Wake up. That's a fucking bitch. Yeah, I'm legitimately dying of starvation. Same. You're right. How do I know that for sure? Because the gasman said they had Dreamland or bust painted on the side of the van and they were dressed like hippies. No, we'll find them. We'll take care of it. I know what I need to do. No, I won't screw it up. - Why is he such an ass? - Hey! You watch your mouth tiny dancer. You don't want to bite the hand that feeds you. You know, I was just thinking, I'd really love to hog tie that alien loving Sawyer. Just saying. Guys, there's no wi-fi. We can't find the guys - without wi-fi. - Where do you think we are? Kill me. Um, so since we're talking about food, you know, and I know we're really hungry, but it's just that this trip has been so much fun and I think we're really close, but I always like to, you know, eat really healthy and save the animals. Can I just suggest that we... - No. - No, no. No. No. - What was that about? - She's vegan. Oh! Oh, my God, perfect. Me too. Uh, we'll definitely find a place for us, okay. I don't get it. Why you eat what food eats? Look at that. See. Poor animals. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! No, I have the perfect nickname for you. You're going to be my soybean. So cute. Okay, so I stopped eating meat like two years ago. And my skin cleared up. It's fantastic. I do it to save the animals. Yeah. Yeah, no, me too. I just, you know, mostly do it for health reasons, but don't worry about it. We're going to definitely find us a place. Well, there're two types of people in this planet. I don't think I like either. Good luck trying to find something. We're in the middle of truck stops and diners. Oh, shit. I don't want to die! That's not my destiny. Yes! Is it time? I'm ready. Take me now. Sorry, cutie. I think I got a car to fix. Take me now. Why would you say that? Well, she thinks she was abducted by aliens and the only reason she came with us was to reunite with them. Alright. Well, on that note. Shit! I told you that in private. - I didn't want them all to know. - I just... Now they'll think I'm insane. Great. Well, get it to it, big boy. Oh fuck! I have something that... here, here. I'm good, I'm good. I got it. - Dude, your ankle, really? - I said I got it! Okay, testosterone levels are spiking. You know what, you're in no fucking condition - to do... - Get the... Going to hit me? You got to be such an ass, Levi. I'll do it. I don't see nothing. Not a van in sight. - Nothing is there. - Where are we? I don't know, because we didn't got no wi-fi. Did I ever tell you fellas about my first security guard gig? - No. - Well, it, uh... started several years ago. It was a strip club in Pahrumph. What was it? A strip club in Pahrumph. - Pahrumph? - Pahrumph. Theo. You're okay? I just suck at life. This was one big stupid mistake. What's the point of freedom if you don't have the freedom to make mistakes? Listen, Theo. I know I got a mouth like a bus with no brakes. But I'm a good listener. So, if you need anything... or need anybody to talk to... I'm here, right? Deal? Hey. Just please don't call me "The Alien girl." You know, my entire school, even the teachers, everyone called me that. And how does someone fit in after something like that? Two weeks ago was my birthday party. It was... it was supposed to be epic. There were bands and models and youtubers and everyone was there. It was supposed to be like every girl's dream party. How is this supposed to help? I'm trying to tell you that everything in life it may look perfect, soybean. But none of it is real. Everything in my life is just a lie... you know. Can you believe that I had the caterer bring out the cake seven times just so I could get the perfect snap to post? I remember sitting there... after and I was so lonely. And I didn't have anybody to talk to. Anyway, this road trip... has made me feel... alive. You know what I mean? I mean, I feel like we could be best friends, right? Well... you really are as selfish as Kai says. No, no, look, I'm just trying to tell you that I'm not the fake chick that you see online. - Yes, you are. - No, soybean. Please, come on. I'm morphing into a better person. I fixed the tire. No thank yous? Welcome. What I learned was upper body strength in this... Is more important than core strength. For a bodyguard? Yes, and a pole dancer. Hello! Welcome to Relish. I'm Jeremy. Just sit yourselves up. I'll be right with you. No. No, okay. Last night was a one off. It was a mistake. Got it. Have we had our reserve yet? Let's not sort the details. No more what ifs. Or if onlys. Well, let's eat. Uh, garçon. I'll be right with you. Here you go. Oh! Thank you. This is will certainly help with the college fees. I guarantee you. Have a nice day! Drive safe. Wow! Dreamland bound? You don't have to answer. It's so obvious. I mean, look at you, unless you're not. But you are, because it's certainly not Halloween, am I right? Oh, huh. Hold on. I have to go make my tips. And save up for college. I'll be right back. And I'm back! Uh, so, where was I? Uh, yes! I'm saving for college, I'm still living with my dad. Uh, what can I get you guys? Do you have anything without meat or dairy - or animal products? - She... your buddy. Oh, oh! Oh, you're serious? What are you... vegetarian? - She's vegan. - I am. Plant based food only, please. And I'll have whatever she's having. And the same for me. What? - Not a word. - Yes, yes. Uh, vegan dishes coming right up. Uh, just toast for me, thanks. Okay. Hear the team cob. Blueberry pancakes, powdered sugar, jam, heaps of butter, boom! Killer meal, right? You said team cob? - You're a gamer? - Yeah. What's your gamertag? Maybe we play. Two at a titan. You dick! You destroyed my KDR like three times. I'm Radog in your MOM 69. - And of course you are. - No way. Dude, you got mad skills. You guys we're... We're sitting next to the call of duty killer right now. Oh, my gosh! You guys seriously played - each other online. - Yeah, like whole last year. Yeah, it's an online tournament, the CoD TDM online championship. - Respect. - Dude. Plot fucking twist. What an incredible coincidence? Fate. What's the opposite of fate? Freedom. This has been a crazy trip. And it's been really fun. Thank you Kai. Relish it. Oh! Oh, I'm going to get Zeus. Been here for everything. Hey, don't get Zeus. I'm gonna get Zeus, he needs to be here with us. And the name is Zeus go! Hey, come with me. Uh, where's the restroom? Uh, outside, to the left, out the door and to the right. God, I would kill for some makeup. What's that? But you don't wear makeup. It's not mine, it's yours. You brought my makeup? I calculated the probability of you coming with us to be astronomically high. I don't understand though. How do you get this stuff for free? No, it's a perk of fame, I guess. And what do you say, you let me paint your face to match that pretty dress? Please, it's fine. See, all the brushes are clean. And this makeup hasn't been used before. Well. - You got to wash your hand. - Okay. Okay. I'm ready, let's do this. Okay. Okay, done. It's perfection. And where do you think you're going? So, get it over with now. Insert your jokes, so I can go take a piss. Fuck off me! Oh my! Look at these boobs. No ways to hide those puppies now, is there? You know what? I'm going to show you why you were born to be a girl, - not a boy. - Fuck you. She betrayed us. Aspen, what is he talking about? He knows where we are and he's coming for us. You know, she's been talking to Director Stratton. Is that true? No. Look, he's been texting me, but I haven't been responding to him, okay. I promise. She told him where we are. No, I didn't, okay, Theo. Why would I want to do that to you guys. I would not do that... Why has he wrote, "I'm coming for you"? Let me see. Why is... You're a liar. - You're a fake. - No. No, okay, Theo. I'm not. I promised you that I did not tell him where we were, okay. Why would I want to go back there? - I did not... - Because you're fucking him! Come here. Oh, there's the van. We didn't even know we'll find. We're going to go in, we're going to grab them. We're not going to make a scene. Like, one flew over the cuckoo's nest or going in to get the crazies. See, she's lying. I told you. Game's over. Time to go back. Please, Robbie, don't do this. - Robbie, please don't take us. - I have to. Where are the others? It's just us. The others disappeared last night. Boom! Bigger weight champions down for the count. Look out. Fuck! Easy, thin lips. Guys! Personal space, Robbie. I'm told not to engage, but you all just fell right into my lap. Oh, it'll be such a pleasure to drag you all back. Alright. - I should just kill myself. - Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Theo, look at me. You don't have to do this. I know you want the thing to stop, but this isn't the right way, okay? I've seen way too many of friends go this way. Just, please just put the knife down. Theo... you're just not taking your meds. Okay, that's all that's happening right now. You're just crashing. That's it. You don't care about me. Yes, I do. Okay, we all do. But this is not you. And it would be a tragedy to take somebody as special as you from us. Look, come on, Theo, just... No, no. No, no, no. No, this is me. Do you think I'm so nice? I'm not, I'm a terrible person. And you're a bitch. Yeah, you know what, Theo, I have been a bitch. Haven't I? Right? Theo, put the knife down. - Just drop it. - Oh, I'm sorry. - I didn't mean that. - No, it's okay. - It's okay. - You must hate me? No. We all say things that we don't mean and that we regret. Theo, we're all in this together. Okay? Listen to me brother. If we don't go now, they're going to take us right back to that facility. We need to go now. Hey, guys, I have whipped up some hash browns. They're vegan. - You betrayed me. - I'm sorry, Robbie. - I needed those... - You hurt me. I won't hurt you again. I promise. Hey, Sawyer, hit him. I said, hit him not decapitate him. I'm sorry. Get out of here. - Okay, here. - Come on. - What are you doing? - I can't drive like this. I can't either. I don't have my license. Well, you got to learn sometime. Please, just buy us some time. - What? - Buy us some time. There is so many buttons. Okay. - Left is brake, right is gas. - Okay. Okay. Seatbelt. Seatbelt. - Oh! - Oh, okay. Hey, hey. You got this. Get in, get in, get in. Sorry about your tire. That was the most exciting two hours of my life. Pull over, pull over, pull over! Go vomit! I'm not cleaning that up. Here, dude, let me help you with that. Let's not hurt your ankle. - Kai, shut up about my ankle. - Get over, come on. Just sit down, bro. There's nothing wrong with your ankle. You didn't break it. No, I never broke my ankle. I just didn't make the cut. Too much attitude, too many cracked skulls. Not enough talent to back it up. I was a loose cannon. So, yeah, I blamed it on my ankle. And I got hooked on painkillers and my dad had no choice but to get me cleaner. Maybe guys, let's be real. Hurt ankle, shattered college dreams. Victim of the opioid crisis, it just sounds better... than asshole got axed from varsity, because he couldn't be a team player. I have to be honest with you, too. I really was abducted by extraterrestrials. You don't believe me, do you? No, I believe you. I don't think you do. You know, I don't doubt that you believe it. You know, it doesn't matter. You know, I'm tired of lying about it. It was real. They promised to take me with them this time and finally be free. Golly, that's sounds crazy. You know what, leave her alone. I mean, Jesus, I'm just sick of everyone pushing their belief's on everybody else. Were you there? - No, I was not there. - Yeah, well then you don't know. We can't believe the truths we don't want to understand. And we believe the lies that we want to believe. Yeah, I lied for so long, I wake up every morning - with a throbbing ankle. - Wow. I would wake up in the morning and ask my fans what I should wear, because I legitimately could not decide for myself. When the likes rush in, it's like... it's such a thrill. That's why you were so addicted to your phone. That's why I broke down. Wait. I heard a lot of it, but I'm pretty sure you said that you checked yourself in. More freedom than the rest of us. You could leave at any time? No. No, I couldn't. Maybe my parents thought it would be best for my fans if I told them that I was... going on a social media cleanse and choosing to check myself in. So, this whole time you were stuck in there - just like us? - Yeah, no free pass. Oh God, that makes me so mad. Why? I spent all that time and energy being jealous of you for nothing. Well, um... here, this may cheer you up. My infamous online meltdown happened right after my highly publicized birthday party. Yeah. Yeah, I was found by the paparazzi crying in fetal position, binge eating my own cake. Ooh! Oh God, I could not feel myself out of bed for a week. Oh, that doesn't make me feel better. Theo. Look, I know you don't believe me, but I did not call director Stratton. Okay, I promise. I mean, it's a coincidence that Robbie shows up right after Stratton's text. What are you guys talking about? I found missed texts and calls... Yeah, on my phone... from Stratton. Why would she turn us in? - Because... - Because I slept with him. I mean, it just happened. I mean, we were in his office and he was talking to me and he was making me feel important and special and, you know, then he was on top of me and I, uh... I don't know, I'm sure I lead him on or something. I don't want to hear anymore. Seriously, Kai, do you think this is easy for me to be telling you right now? You didn't do anything wrong, Aspen. This is on him. I didn't want to keep it from you guys. I just didn't think it was something that I just announced, you know. And look, Theo, I promise you, I promise you that I did not call him. I believe you. That was really brave of you to share, Aspen. And you know, Kai, you know, I seem to throw a little bit of Heisman when it comes to sharing... - Private person. - Yeah, yeah, private person. I think it's just cause you got some... skeletons in your closet like the rest of us. Or maybe it's cause I don't want to share my personal life with you, dipstick. Fair. Fine. I grew up suburbia. And my parents did everything right. Gymnastics, tutors, tennis. And they always just used to drill into my head, till you know exactly who you are... You can't be truly free. Exactly. But the one thing that they couldn't understand, was I do know who I am. That's... not at all what I expected. Well, you need to be who you are. Was that why they locked you in there? Well, no. Not until I told them I needed an operation and hormone therapy. That sucks. Hey, maybe our parents should be social drinking pals. They can get together and complain about their defective children. A come on come. I thought I could live like this, but I can't. It's too hard. I just want the freedom to be me. I mean, look... even in this bigoted world there's trans people going into office. Not because they're trans, but because they have really good fucking ideas. We're just like everybody else. So, what do we do now? Whatever we want. Well, I'm good, let's... let's go. I need to go back. I need help. I'll drive you Theo. You know what guys... this has been the best two days of my life. Okay, and as much as I'd rather be raving my ass off at Dreamland it's... more important for me to help a friend. What about Stratton? If you go back, they're just going to lock you up. You let me worry about Stratton. Zeus and I'll make sure he gets what he deserves. Well, guys, you know I can't let you go alone. Yeah, hold me after that head smashing escapade. You better go back. Hey. Here. Aspen. Come with me. I can't. Okay, this is the one chance that I have to actually help someone. No, yeah. I get it. Where are you going to go? I don't know. Uh, hey, wait, um... here. We made our reserve. Open PayPal and take the money, okay? - It's yours. - What's this for? And here I'll be out of the facility and hopefully... be the person I meant to be. And this is so you can do. And maybe, I don't know... we can buy some fake ID's and take me out for a drink. Please. You don't think I'm going to have girls lining up around the block for me? Not the girls I know. So, this is it? We're breaking up? Yeah, I guess, we're now. I hope you find your friends. I already found my friends. My search for extraterrestrial beings are just an exploration of curiosity at this point. See you soon. Oh, Sawyer, wait. - Oh, my... - Here. Thank you. Hey! Hey! Farewell my demoted band of Misfits! Richard Stratton. We've got evidence of non-council statutory rape and patient abuse. Oh!
