So Fu. So Fu. So Fu. Adabi. Adabi. Adabi. Adabi. Adabi. No answer? Adabi? Got your lines right? - Yes, Sergeant. Mr Carter is safe. Adabi. Adabi. Mr Dobson. Sir, there is a line dead. Adabi. The Carter estate, sir. No reply. Hello? Hello. Hello? Any more to check? - The Frazer estate, Tuan. That's all. - Keep trying. Adabi. Yeah? Adabi here. Well, I hope they are safe. Yes. We are alright. Not a sound since you rang at four. Let me know if there's been any trouble. What was that? You didn't set the clock. Didn't I? Of course you didn't. What was it then? The check call. Do you think I've talked to the clock? Alright. I guess it was the check call. And I didn't set the clock. Good morning, Tuan. - Good morning. It will be a nice day today. Thank you. What does that say, Tuan? 'Mrs J. Frazer. Passenger to London'. 'Care of Duprez. Chalfont St Giles, Bucks'. 'United Kingdom'. 'Not wanted on voyage'. Bucks? Buckinghamshire. Very lovely place, Putra. Where the father of Mem lives. Will Tuan Mike come back when he finishes at school? If he wants to be a planter, yes. If not, no. And Mem? When she finishes taking Mike on long journey will she come back? Have some tea taken to the Mem. Tea for the Mem. Quickly. Come on. Tuan angry this morning. He shouted at me. [ Gunshot! ] Good morning, Ah Mov. Good morning, Mem. - Put it down here. [ Gunshot! ] Tuan angry. Why do you say that? Two weeks ago, Tuan shoot tin. And he not miss. Now he miss. Putra is right. Tuan angry. I think you and Putra are imagining things. No. Daddy didn't tell me he was shooting this morning. Aren't you going to say good morning? I don't want to miss the guns. Tell daddy I am coming. Jim. You didn't say you were going to practice. Well, need I? You needn't. But Mike would like to come down. Good morning. - Morning, Mr Frazer. Well done. It's good to see all these trees giving rubber again. We must be well above our pre-war average now. We will do a lot better if the bandits keep away. There was a bit in the papers about them slashing trees across the river. They've done a lot of damage. - Well, I'm going to go on planting. I want to get the contractor clearing the jungle on the west of the Bi Tong. Abdul. [ Malay language ] Rice again, Nair? The bandits threatened to cut her throat. So she left a kilo bag here each morning this week. For all we know he's probably watching us now. Better run her down to the police. See if they can get more out of her. I'm going to the checkpoint. Yesterday she was thin-sized. Today .. Let's take a look at that one too. Rice. Two bags. Sardines. Take him away. They can't blame these people for doing this sort of thing. They're being forced to it. But we can blame ourselves if we let any more food get out of here. So. Double your checks. Make more snap searches. You can't expect me to do everything. She can't tell us much. They all look the same in the dark, she says. This is the first time the bandits have been getting at the Tamils. It all points to greater activity in the area. I'm on my way over to tell Frazer about last night. His neighbour Carter was shot. And all the bungalows burnt. His Chinese contractor didn't escape. He and his wife are both dead. The little girl So Fu is in hospital. But there's never been more than armed holdups in this district, Mr Dobson. We must look upon this as a danger spot from now on. This bandit pocket is working nearer. The man behind these new outbreaks is .. Ah Siong. Late of the Chinese 136 Group. Trained by us to fight the Japs. And believe it or not he marched beside us in the victory parade. Well. I think Mr Frazer has carried out all the safety precautions laid down. He is well prepared. - Good for him. Anyway, to help I've laid on a snap search of your Chinese labour. And the old squatters camp. Bandits have always found it easiest to intimidate their own countrymen. Everybody out of their huts. I want them all searched for arms. Identity card. - You have pass? When did he come to the Kampong? Come on. There is someone hiding there. There he is. A bandit. Take him away. You're out early, Hugh. I'm only staying a minute. Hand this over to Frazer's guards while I go inside. Don't make it too obvious. Anything wrong? There was a bit of trouble over at Carter's place last night. He was shot and the place set on fire. The factory was badly damaged. That's terrible, Hugh. They haven't been attacking bungalows? Probably just one incident. Maybe a local grudge against Carter. Poor little So Fu. She was coming over this afternoon to play with Mike. He wants to say goodbye. I see you're packed. Nearly. It's a long job. It depends how long you are going for. What do you mean? You don't have to hedge with me, Liz. What's the real trouble? Tell me. Everything is wrong, Hugh. By that you mean .. Jim? Have you seen him lately? He gave me a wave the other day. That is all I get. That is our life in one movement. These are difficult times. I know all that, Hugh. I was born out here. I understand this country. For both of us planting is the only life we know. If anybody can take .. Barbed-wire, guards and guns .. And all this it should be Jim and me. But look at us. Things have altered for everybody out here, Liz. When people like you and Jim share a life .. Share? If that were true I could take anything. It's not like that. Our marriage has been pushed into the background. Jim has let this place become an obsession. Jim is a fine planter. And you know it. Every day I tell myself that. But it's not enough. I can't take it anymore. How long will you be gone? Before Mike goes to school there are clothes to buy. His grandfather must get to know him. - I see. You are not coming back. No. Never? If I'm not needed here now that things are bad .. If I'm to be sent away I'll stay away. It's better to make a clean cut now before we start hating and bickering. I thought the idea was just to .. Just to take Mike back. That's just Jim's way of putting it. In that case you must tell him. Try Liz. Don't just let it be a letter from England. Tell him today. Promise? I'll try. No man can stick this place a month if he's worrying about his wife. Homemade landmines now. He says the two bandits threw them away when our guards surprised them. Here is his identity card. Wan Li. Contractor from Kwala Hutang. What's he doing down here? It could be genuine. A pretty unlikely story. You say you were held up by bandits? Yes. They came out from the jungle over there. And ordered me to be at the top of that hill at dusk. To meet their leader. But when your guards appeared in the rubber .. The bandits threw away the mines and left me standing here. But my guards said they never saw any bandits. But it is true, Mr Frazer. How did you know my name was Frazer? Over there on your noticeboard. Please, Mr Frazer. It's most important now that I get to Sungei Panjang as fast as possible. My car is known and I am afraid. May I go into town with you? You do drive in every Tuesday, don't you? You seem to know a lot about my movements. Too darned much. Yes. I am going to into Sungei Panjang this morning. And you can come with me. Not because I am sorry for you. Because I'd sooner have you under my eye than wandering loose near my estate. Mike. Will you be a long time away? Years and years. I would rather have Mr Mangles. I would rather go to London. London may be the biggest city in the world. But it's not got skyscrapers like Singapore. That's not a proper one, Matt. Not like the skyscrapers in New York. But in London there are jolly high things. How high? Hundreds of feet high. Hundreds? Tell me one place. Nelson's column. He's an Admiral on top of a stone pole. Why? Because he's dead. How high? Four hundred feet. - Four hundred? How do you know? You have never been there. Everybody knows. Mem? Ladies aren't much good at how high things are. But I bet she'll know that. You will see. Mummy. Darling, don't play with that. Mummy. How high is Nelson's column? I suppose about 200 feet, darling. Why? There's daddy. Matt. Tell Putra to get Tuan his breakfast. Putra. Putra. Hey, Mike. You didn't meet me at the gate this morning, son. I got talking. Daddy. Do you think Nelson's Column is only two hundred feet high? More like a hundred, son. Why do you want to know? Mummy says it is two hundred. That was only a guess, Mike. Daddy knows more about those things than I do. You two run along. Come on, Mike. Let's play with the soldiers. How is the Bi Tong division? Under control. There was fifteen percent more rubber in the first batch. I am clearing all the jungle on the left of the road. Thank you. Hugh was here. Yes. I saw him on the way. He told me about last night. He talks too much. I suspected for some time Carter wasn't keeping his guards on the top line. These things don't run themselves you know. Jim, please. Let's stop going around in circles. I know what's on your mind. Well. Tomorrow, your main anxiety will be over. Mike and I will be gone. Then everything will be alright, won't it. It won't matter anymore why you're sending me away. The polite little lie that's grown between us won't be there anymore. I'll just be another loving mother taking her son to school. You know Mike ought to be at school. Away from all this. You know as I do that Mildred Saunders could take him along with her own boy. So what is the truth? Is it me? Am I in the way? Or is it vulgar to speak honestly to your wife? You know what this parting means to me. I wish I did. I cannot bear to see what's happening to us. We didn't plan for these last three years. No. We planned wonderful things. In prison camp we were planning. When Nick died and I was ill. And when Mike was born and we got this place on its feet again. But plans must materialise sometime. And they can only materialise if we're together. Your safety means everything to me. But if I go away .. You are going away. Tomorrow. I am taking the car into Sungei. Let me go with you. But you couldn't take Mike. He's safer here than on the road. I don't want to take him. Please let me come along. Please. What about your packing? There are only a few things left. I can do them this afternoon. What makes you so cheerful all of a sudden? I love going into town with you. Come round the side of the culvert. Come on. Put your foot down and step on it. Inform the next checkpoints, will you. I don't like it. They're after someone. Keep on driving. Fast. Tell me, Wan Li. Why should the bandit leader want to see you? I am a man of some means, Mr Frazer. Were you in Malaya during the war? Yes. In a Jap prison camp. Why? Malaya was with Ah Siong in those days. Ah Siong? Yes. He was our leader. Up against the Japs. Have you associated with him since? Do I look like a terrorist? Look. It's a funeral. I'll have to stop. If this is an ambush .. Life is but a weary labour. Death is honour and rejoicing. The family is a wonderful thing, Mr Frazer. And it is an evil son who destroys it. Fireworks. He must have been a very rich gentleman. Thank you, Mrs Frazer. I'm sorry I suspected you but .. These things happen nowadays. Is there anything we can do to help? I want to tell the police all I know. I was going to see my niece So Fu. She was shot last night. So Fu? You mean the little girl who comes to play is your niece? Yes. She was seriously injured in the Carter attack. I am so sorry. But don't worry. I'll go to the hospital and see her. Good luck, Wan Li. Bye, darling. I must hurry. You take the car. Jim. Jim. You don't have to rush. We're in town now. It's perfectly safe. Let's be together on my last day. - Darling, I must get this machine. Oh no. Just for a minute. Look. Let's go and see the boats. Selamat tinggal. Selamat tinggal kepada anda yang tinggal. 'Selamat tinggal'. 'Farewell to you who are staying'. I will see you at the club. What you've told us Mr Wan ties up the scraps of news we received on Ah Siong. This might be useful. - Thank you. Know how to use it? Yes. I was in 136 Group. Good. Without chaps like you coming forward as loyal citizens .. We'd never catch a single bandit in this jungle of yours. Here's some ammunition, Wan Li. Don't take your coat off when you're feeling hot. If I were you I would travel in public conveyances from now on. Thank you, Captain Dell. Bye, Mr Dobson. Good luck, Wan Li. - Yes. Good luck. Hey. Jim Frazer. Are you trying to knock off army property? I want a machine gun. You know very well I won't issue a Bren for the car. And run the risk the of the bandits wiping you out with it. Yes. Well, after tomorrow I will take my chance of driving into an ambush. But if I'm expected to defend my own place .. I want to put a Bren gun in the bathroom where I can get a wider field of fire. Now you're talking. A good idea. Come round and we'll fix you up from our store. Jim wants to get his wife away. Turn himself into a fortress to fight it out with the bandits. If his type leave there will be nothing left in Malaya for us to defend. If his wife goes there will be no planter. There. Isn't that pretty, So Fu? When I get better can I play with Mr Mangles? Of course you can, dear. And Mike too. He's going away to school in England. But Matt will keep the mongoose for you. Oh Good. I do want to come and play again. Alright, Jack. Let's hear what you have to say. Take it from me. If all the planters west of the Telemung made more use of river transport .. We wouldn't be losing our lorries and their precious rubber .. At the rate of one a day on the roads. Sorry I'm late, Pete. Hello, Jack. How's things, Jack? I think I could manage alright. If Jim can I'm darned sure you can. Frazer is going to back me up. Liz. Thanks for rescuing me, Hugh. I couldn't face the WVS. Not today. We've made old Jim a happy man. We? - Yes. We've given him a nice, new shiny Bren gun for his bathroom. Hugh, I don't know what to do. When I saw So Fu in the hospital just now. I thought how easily it could have been Mike. He must get away from here. But Jim and me. These last few hours have made quite a difference. In the marketplace. I have really felt he did not want to leave me. Liz. I shan't see you for a month or two so I thought I'd say goodbye. Goodbye, Bill. Sorry I skipped off, darling. But the gun was pretty important. I didn't think I'd get it by legal means. Have a drink, Jim. - No, no. I'll get it. You stop and talk to Liz. What are you going to have? - I think a stinger. Two stingers please. So you've changed your mind. Now you will try and change his. What are you trying to say? Liz. Don't make Jim do anything you'll both regret. Don't make him try to follow you. You know he's needed out here. He has an obstinate feeling he's being pushed out of Malaya by these bandits. His whole life is out here. Nothing is more important than Jim and me. If you took him away .. He'd hate you for the rest of his days. I don't think so. So you've made up your mind? You have for me. Will you be here when I leave tomorrow? I don't know. Please don't hate me, Hugh. Coffee, sir? Well, Mildred. I suppose you and Liz feel a bit strange going home tomorrow with your kids. Today, England may seem a long way off. But four weeks on a ship passes in no time. Romantic nights in the Indian Ocean with the band playing. The lazy days in the blue Mediterranean. Gibraltar. And before you know it, Liverpool. And you hear English voices everywhere. Wake up the next morning. Pull back the curtains, sniff the air. Malaya might have been a dream. You see if I'm not right, Mildred. Have you finished? - Yes. I can't understand Harry and Jim for the life of me. Why don't you two go on leave together? Why don't you take some leave? - Me? I never do. - Why not? England would be no good to me. It couldn't stand all the shocks. I was so glad you took a separate table. I wanted to have lunch alone too. We didn't get much chance to talk with old Jack doing a Kipling on us. He is alright. You are tired. You were up late last night packing. Better get a rest when we get back. Are you going too? Well, there is a pay parade. No arms inspection. That's at four, darling. A couple of hours yet. Right? Right. Come on. Keep moving. No need to stop. What's up? The gate's open. Look at the guard. There's something there in that bush. Cover the other side. Stick 'em up. Stick 'em up. Mike. Mummy, mummy. We were playing ambushes. We killed a guard. Pretend. Look. Go on. Run inside. Both of you. Run along, son. Those boys. You know, Liz. I might have shot both of them. Yes. But you really can't be angry with them. No. Daddy. Daddy is resting, darling. I'll be out later. Daddy. What is it, Mike? Sorry. That's alright, son. Watch out for the plane like a good chap. It's pay-day you know. Liz. I'm here, darling. You were dreaming. I was in the Jap prison camp again. And you were in the other hut. A mile away. Cut off from the world. Wondering if we'd ever see each other again. You called my name. Did I? Oh, it's broken. Come on, Mike. After it. It's got torn. It's alright, Mike. We'll mend it after tea. Come on. Hello Mike. - Hello. Thank you, Putra. Come back to England with me, darling. Please come back. Ever since this trouble started I've waited. I was afraid you'd ask me that. I didn't have the courage until today. There is the plane. Good man. Tell Nair I'll be with him in a minute. You know I can't leave this place, Liz. Nair. I want all these shrubs and flowers cut back. The field of fire has got to be clear. It's a shame beautiful things must be destroyed. Nothing must go wrong at the last moment. You'd better move your kit over here. We can't defend two bungalows. Join your guards with mine from tonight onwards. But I can't. Alright. You can bring Armina as well. She can't stay in your bungalow on her own. How did you know? I noticed the way she looks at you. Anyway, it's none of my business. I've run out of spit, Matt. Mike, that is not nice. Can I go and get some water for it? - Of course. Not much or it won't stick. Matt. Look, Mike. I've mended it. Stay where you are. Mummy. - Mike, come away from there. May I go? - Yes. Of course. Nair. I'm thinking of taking some leave. Think you could manage on your own? I'll do my best, sir. I'll have a word with the agents about it. What's that going on? The bandits have slapped another poster up. Tuan. Tuan Frazer! The guard thinks he got into the rubber. - Well, he won't make the jungle. The wire there is covered by the guards. He may get into the tapper's lines at the bungalow compound. Get 3 men and head him off at the tapper's lines. I'll take these men. We fan out and drive him towards you. Avoid shooting if you can. I want to get him alive. Come on. We'll drive him up to the top gate. Can you see him yet? He must be somewhere near the top. There he is. He's got away. He must have doubled back. Fan out. Down the hill again. Try behind those rocks. There he is! Mem. They say it means man-child. Dear Armina. The alarm. You go back to the bungalow. I'll find Mike. Mike. Matt. No. No. No. No. [ Gunshot! ] Cover that body. Calm these people. Take the boys to the office and ring Dobson. Matt, Mike. Come along. But this is an emergency, Nair. We can't wait for the next Adabi call. Alright, sir. Where's Mike? Darling, he is safe. He's with Nair. Matt is there too. Hello? Yes? The line's dead, sir. It must have been cut by that bandit. Oh. That settles it, Nair. You know what to do. Alert the whole estate with a warning red. Then bring Mike up here and .. We'll discuss the defences together. Yes, sir. Bandits, Mike. Yes. Come on. That's what I call a defence. I feel much more comfortable now we have the Bren. Alright. I'll let you men take over. Putra. Get some mattresses and food down here for the kids. Alright, Sergeant. I'll take the Reising. Let's get going. Get some more ammo up here. Sight the Reising there. I'm going to the power house. Right, Tuan. Mike. - Mummy. Isn't it exciting. Bandits everywhere. Oh no. Tell Armina to put her things into the room. Take him inside, Matt. You are both very welcome. I am sure you know that. Thank you, Mrs Frazer. Sorry you had to leave your home but let's hope it's only for one night. Anyway, if Mr Frazer takes his leave .. Leave? When? He was talking to me this afternoon. Cover the other side. Better get this filled in quickly. Well. We're ready for anything that may happen now. The barbed-wire is complete. We're inside two rings of lights, so if they try to cross .. We've got them. The foreman saw flashes on the on the treetops on the ground over the Biltong. It's probably the sun shining on a tin. Switch on our lights and let's relax. But they must work. I'll check the fuses. In half an hour it will be dark. Come on. Adabi. Adabi. Adabi. Yes. Adabi. Darling, that looks like a lot of smoke. Nothing to make a fuss about. I believe that was a Very Light. I'm sure it was. Yes. It is. Red. Blue. Red. By Jove, so it is. It's old Jim's place. Sing out if anything else goes up. - Alright. Hello. Nair's bungalow is still burning. Have you seen anything? Nothing since Jack's reply to the signal. Perhaps the telephone lines are cut. Maybe. I'm sure old Jack will do everything he can to help us. It will take some time though. Sir. Lieutenant Summers is coming up, sir. Where is he? Seven miles from the Frazer estate. Map reference figures: 7-3-9-6-0-4. The south bank of the river. The ferry has been sunk by the bandits. Yes. The ferry is quite useless. This is the nearest we can get vehicles. Let's make it a rendezvous for the platoon. As fast as they can get here. In the meantime, I'm going over to make a recce at Frazer's. And I'll meet you here within the hour. Roger? Okay. Out. Better keep a listening watch. - Yes, sir. You come with me. Nothing through yet. Now is the time to check the wire back to the power house. Armina. Is he asleep? Yes, Mem. He is asleep. Perhaps now I need some help too. I can't spare anyone from here. He knows how to look after himself though. The fan. They found the break. Don't switch on the lights until Nair gets back. Daddy. Shall I look for him? I am awake. No, Mike. You come along with me. I want you and Matt to sit in the tunnel with Armina. We'll tell you when the lights have switched on. Standby to open fire. We switch on in a moment. Well done, Nair. Leave it open. You have their books. Yes. Tuan. He's going to read the one about the bandits. It's still dark out there. You can't see a thing past the wire. Get ready to switch on when I tell you. Okay, darling. Give me the gun. Switch on. Jim. Look. Down! I think it's the gunfire. How many? Two? Are they all dead? Armina. Come up quickly. One has been shot. Armina, bring up bandages. He's bleeding from the shoulder. Take off his shirt. We have to bandage him as best we can and drag him down into the tunnel. There is a man up there where I'm pointing. Mike, jump down quick. He's been shot. I don't think they'll be using planes, darling. Is everything alright? Yes. Everything is quiet as an ordinary night now. Nair is having a look around the wire. I wouldn't be surprised if they've chucked it in. I am sorry. Why? For all this. I've been a fool. Months ago I should have kissed you goodbye and put you firmly on the train. Then at least, our love would have been safe. No. No. It would never have been safe. This morning I promised Hugh to tell you something. Promised Hugh? That if you sent me away .. I would never come back to you. Liz. Is that true? When I woke up today I thought we were the same as we were yesterday and .. And the months that have gone before. I've watched other people, Jim. I've seen what happens to them. After thirteen years I thought .. Perhaps the excitement had gone for you. No, Liz .. no. You see. I think it works this way. Love must be cherished and protected like the trees you plant. And all the endless things that would .. Give up in despair if something weren't there to give them strength. Tonight, you have given me strength. And tomorrow? Mr Frazer. Nair? I think they have slashed the rubber near the wire skirting the Biltong. The new trees? - Yes. We'll work out something for us. Look after Mrs Frazer. Send one guard back here with his rifle to cover this side just in case. You go out? There's been no sound of shots for an hour. If they think they're going to spend the night hacking my rubber trees .. And all that rubber going to waste .. They've made a big mistake. You must kill the lights while I get through the wire. I know a way, Tuan. Underneath the wire. No need to kill lights. I will show you. I think I have a tunnel. Come on. We'll go out now. How is the guard, old boy? - He is very weak. I have given him nearly all the brandy. Funny stuff, rubber, isn't it? Yeah. My wife won't wear it. She says it cools her feet. Well, what are we waiting for? Hello, Bushell. He insisted on coming here. Yes. He saw the Very Light first. Blimey. They don't half talk, don't they? Be fair, chum. They got to work things out. Give me a dozen men. I'll get you through to Frazer's. Alright, Summers. Move your mortars up. But no nearer. Mortars? You can't use mortars. You'll ruin the rubber. But you wanted to save your friend. Yes. But rubber is rubber you know. It takes 25 years to grow. Old Jim wouldn't like to lose his trees. You tell him. They're using 2-inch mortars, HE and smoke. They won't do much damage but they might scare the bandits off. I'll tell Jim you were asking after him. What's that? - It's a hole. It comes up in the jungle over there. - I can't get through there. Mike and me can. Come on. Nair, isn't there something Armina can do? Well. She's very good at making tea, Mrs Frazer. Armina. Tea. Why does Mr Frazer want the Bren gun? He thinks it will give better cover. He thinks the attack is over. He has gone out there. To those trees. I know he has. Don't! Jim is out there. I'll give him another three minutes. Those shots are outside the wire. They have a machine gun. They're shooting out the lights. Where is our crossfire? What are they doing? What is Nair doing? That's better. That will stop them creeping through. Come on. We'll get that machine gun. I'll go first. No! Armina, Armina. Hello? Please. Get Mr Frazer. It is very important. Mummy. There's a gentleman asking for daddy. Mike. On the telephone, mummy. Mike. Yes? I asked for Mister Frazer. Where is he? My husband is not here. Who are you? Where are you speaking from? I am Ah Siong. I want you to know your husband is in our hands. I don't believe it. It is true, Mrs Frazer. Please. Lay down your guns. And all of you come out of the bungalow. I don't wish to kill women and children. I don't believe you. If it's true, ask my husband to speak to me on the telephone. There is no time for that, Mrs Frazer. I give you ten seconds to make up your mind. You can save your husband's life and your own. Ten seconds, Mrs Frazer. I am counting. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. They've got them. Matt. It's alright. What's happening? I don't know. Jim is still out there. They tried to make me believe he was a prisoner. On top. Over there. I can't get back. Can I stay with you? Two hundred yards. HE. Rapid fire! But Jim. How can he ever get back? They'll have taken cover. They? - Matt's with him. Then they may both be killed. I'll go through the tunnel to look for them. I'll go with you. No. You stay here and keep a lookout. Alright, boys. We move in at the back of the house. Follow me. - Right. Boys. You wait here. You stay there until I call. There's another gun on the other side. See where it is. Hugh. Alright, Liz? - Yes. Jim's out there somewhere. There's a way through the tunnel. Oh Nair. Nair. He is dead. Keep out. There's one of them in the tunnel. Jim. Jim! Alright, Jim. I'll shoot him out from this end. Alright. Go ahead. Jim. Jim. Jim. Jim. Look out! Take cover. Down. Jim. Darling. Oh, Jim. Nair was down there. Dead? He was trying to find you. He probably saved you. Where is Mike? He's safe. He'll sleep on the train tomorrow. Adabi. Adabi. Adabi. Goodbye, mummy darling. Look after daddy and Matt and Armina and everything. Yes. I will, darling. Tell grandpa that daddy is coming home on leave. Goodbye, Mike. Goodbye, Matt. Look after Mr Mangles. Goodbye, Mike old chap. Keep your chin up. Look after him, Mildred. We will. See you when all this trouble is over. ..r-o-s..
