(CRYING SOFTLY) We've been able to manage your disease for 10 years. But now, the chemotherapy is no longer controlling the cancer. The disease has spread to the lungs and spine, and two vertebrae have already been affected. Now, it's the chemotherapy, which is making you weak and feeble. That's why we have to stop it. LIVIA: So what do we do? The best thing medicine can offer you is a bone marrow transplant. We don't do that here yet, so I want you to go to America for the procedure. The risk of fatality is very high, but if you don't do this, everything is gonna be very quick. I don't want to die in the hospital. I want to die at home. And what if he doesn't do the transplant, what happens then? You've got two or three months to live. It's your choice. What kind of bullshit medicine do you practice that you can't even cure me?! I want you to know that if one of us had to die, I'd rather it were me, not you. Truth is, if one of us are gonna die, it's gonna be me, not you. I'll tell you another thing: You're lying. If one of us has to die, I'd rather it be you, not me. I want to stay alive.

(GENTLE CHANTING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) (ZIPPER ZIPS) OFFICIANT: I'm here to celebrate the union in marriage of Livia and Diego, that your bodies and hearts be one until death do you part. Livia Monteiro Bueno, is it of your own free will that you take Diego to be your legitimate spouse? Yes. OFFICIANT: Diego Fairman, is it of your own free will that you take Livia to be your legitimate spouse? Yes. OFFICIANT: Considering these affirmations made by each of you before me, I declare you man and wife. (GROUP CHEERS) (WOMAN SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) (MAN YELLING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) - Ooh! - Ah. I've known this bastard since he arrived in Brazil, and some shit illness is not going to take away the finest of our generation. I know he's gonna beat it. I propose a toast! (GROUP CHEERS) To the groom, to the bride, that at this moment is shamelessly getting married. (GROUP LAUGHS) Livia, my dear, please, say something. Say what, that during my rebellious years, I did everything I wanted to, and then some? (GROUP LAUGHS) And I have no regrets. But I should confess you that ever since I was a girl, I've always dreamed of a white wedding with a nice dress and all the trimmings. I knew the minute I met this son of a bitch, now my husband, that he was sick. I abandoned a marriage and brought with me a son, our Daniel, to live with him. And today, he has made me his wife and the happiest woman in the world. (GROUP LAUGHS) I guess this is my turn. I'd like to toast to all of you, my friends, who, in a way, are characters in the story of my life. And of course, I want to toast this unbearably lovely woman, who I desire so much, and I want to make the happiest person in the world and fulfill all her dreams. I love you, Livia. MAN: Woo-hoo. - Woo-hoo. - (GROUP CHEERS) MAN: Yeah! MAN: Woo-hoo! MAN: Yeah, yeah, yeah, - yeah, yeah! - Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! A moment of silence, please. My love, I have a confession to make: I've already cheated on you. - Oh, my god. - (MAN LAUGHS) That's all right, I cheated on you too. (GROUP LAUGHS) (GROUP SINGING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) ("LA VIE EN ROSE") (GLASS CLINKING) I'd like to propose a round of applause for Dona Sebastiana, who prepared this magnificent feast. (GROUP CHEERS) (GROUP CHATTERING) I love cooking. I love it, don't I? And when I asked my mother for the recipe, she refused. That way, she said, when she died, I'd have something to remember her by. WOMEN: Aww. Try the Brunello, Diego. You can feel the nice long finish it has. Aromas of rancid olives and sleepy hazelnuts, lying on a bed of Roman cow dung in the moonlight. 96 points. Robert Parker. (GROUP LAUGHS) It's good. WOMAN IN RED: Hello, everybody. - Oh, hi. - (GROUP CHATTERING) - Hello. - Hi, hi. We're so late, I'm sorry. You know, we were shooting just down the street, but I didn't even have time to change. MAN: You look beautiful. We simply couldn't miss your wedding. Manuela, those two, who are they? Oh, they are that couple from the soap opera. They are such stars. Oh, really? I propose a toast. To Antonio, who is helping his brother Diego in times of need, to my mother, who raised three sons in difficult times, and to you, Diego, I hope you come home soon. To family. ALL: To family. - To your family. - (GROUP CHATTERING) I'd like you to all take a good look at this man because I'm going on a trip, and I'm not sure there's a way back. And before I forget, you can all go to hell. (GROUP LAUGHS) (ELEGANT MUSIC) This is Diego's brother, to whom he hasn't spoken for over 10 years, and he's going to be the donor. Diego blames him for their father's death. He was the favorite son. He lost everything their father had, gambling. That's terrible. You think he's coming back? Probably not. I don't know. And if he does, it's not going to be easy for him. That champagne is really good. Where does it come from? It was my wedding present. Oh, not my farewell present? (DIEGO CHUCKLES) You decide. I decide? That's a good one. (GROUP CHUCKLES) Hey, Gabi, you remember that night we were sitting around the hotel pool, and you started screaming because that naked German guy slapped you because you wouldn't suck his cock? (GROUP LAUGHS) That night, you really went up in my esteem. (GABI CHUCKLES) Come on, Diego, how little you know me. I know you. Yeah, you do. You know why I didn't suck his cock? You tell me. Yeah, because I don't like soft cocks, baby. - Don't look at me like that! - (GABI LAUGHS) I only like hard ones, like you. - Oh, me too, me too. - (GABI LAUGHS) They work better that way. Can you believe it? He says I'm jealous of him. You think a woman like me needs to be jealous of a guy like this? Ouch. He's the one who should be jealous of me. I heard you have the most gorgeous breasts in the world, is it true? I have, do you want to see? - No, don't do that. - Shut up. - Come on. - Do you want to see? Yes or no? - Come on. - Yes, I do. (GROUP CHATTERING) Yes! All right, all right. Oh! - Come on, you're drunk. - Oh! All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, party's over. I'll let you have that one. I know you saw my movie and I know you didn't like it. That's why you didn't say anything, right? So I'll tell you, you didn't understand a damn thing. That's why you have to see it again. If you really want to know, I'll tell you. I did see it again, and that screenplay you gave me to read wasn't the film you made. The movie you made was more like a feature-length mayonnaise commercial. (GROUP CHUCKLES) You're just an ad man who's gotten rich selling crap to people who have nothing to eat. You say one more word, I will stand up and leave. All I want to know is what are you gonna do with the tux you bought to go to the Oscars? The only reason I don't beat you up is because I know you're gonna die soon. Did I ever tell you the one about my uncle Samuel who went in for heart surgery? Did I ever tell you the one about my uncle Samuel going into heart surgery? - Tell it, Diego. - He's a drag. (GROUP LAUGHS) (CRYING SOFTLY) Hey. There's nothing we can do. I'm scared. I've got a bad feeling about this. Won't you ever deign to make a film with me? We find a good story, we'll do it. It's my greatest dream. I would do anything to be directed by you. Anything? Go to the bathroom, I'll meet you there. Where's Mother? She already left with Antonio. She said you didn't thank him. I don't know what to say. I hope things work okay for you. Hey, little fella. I married your mother. What do you think about that? It was about time. Your mom and I are going away tomorrow. Everything will go on as usual here. Dona Sebastiana will look after you, and you'll continue to go to school and play soccer. I have to go away because I'm very sick. Are you going to die? Maybe. It's for you. Hello, good morning. I'm Dr. Mary Flowers, your oncologist. From now on, you're under my care. I'll try to explain quickly what we're going to do. Right now, we're introducing a catheter into your thorax to reach your vena cava. And from now on, all your medication and blood tests will be administered by this means. We'll start with a total body irradiation, and then induce intensive chemotherapy treatment. Our objective is to eliminate your red and white blood cells and the platelets already contaminated with the disease. Only then, we will be able to perform the transplant itself. The donor's cells will enter your blood stream and start a battle with the cancer cells which survived our treatment. Out of this entire shock procedure, we'll start creating a new immune system. Any questions? No. So that's the transplant? It's a matter of creating a new person in a body which is currently sick, yes. And what about me? 'Cause I've been here for three days and no one told me anything. Oh, you like boxing, huh? (MARY CHUCKLES) Well, now the bell has rung and they've taken away your stool. We'll take good care of you. Excuse me. Thank you. Good morning. How are you doing? Good. Please, sign here, authorizing us to use drugs not yet approved by the FDA. Are you allergic to anything? - Yes. - What? Boring people. This other one exempts this institution from any responsibility in case of death. Ah. (DIEGO CHUCKLES) If you are incapacitated or go into a vegetative state, whom do you nominate to take responsibility on your behalf? Okay. Thank you very much. Have a good one. Thank you. The risks of infection during a bone marrow transplant are very high. And an infection is not something we'd want just now. I'm Dr. Isaac, your infectious disease specialist. - Okay. - And I'll be supervising - your case. - Yeah. (GENTLE MUSIC) (TREADMILL WHIRRING) (RETCHING LOUDLY) (PANTING SOFTLY) (LIVIA CHUCKLES) Mm. Looks like we have a Peeping Tom here. (BOTH CHUCKLE) Stop it. (DIEGO CHUCKLES) DIEGO: Uh-huh. Ah. Yes, we do, yes, we do. (LIVIA CHUCKLES) Good morning, I'm Dr. Morris. This is my assistant, Virginia. Good morning. She's going to install this bag with a morphine-based analgesic, which regulates the dosage that will keep you free of pain. If you feel any pain, you just use the pump, and you increase the amount you receive. DR. MORRIS: On a scale of one to 10, how much pain you'd say you're feeling right now? I'd say 10 so I can use the pump. Yeah, then we have a problem because the treatment hasn't even started. And once it does, don't get too excited. Machine is regulated to a limit, since an overdose might cause you a heart attack. If the pain persists, well, we'll have to give you something stronger which will leave you unconscious. And please, don't hesitate to send for me anytime. Dr. Morris, pain and drugs. MARY: We're removing a sample of your bone marrow to know whether it is contaminated with cancerous cells. I've applied a local anesthesia that works subcutaneously, but it doesn't work on the bone. You'll feel a strong pinch, so I want you to take a deep and slow breath. Okay. Here we go. (GROANING LOUDLY) Almost there. (GROANING LOUDLY) Hold on. Hold on, second pass. (DIEGO GROANS LOUDLY) (SLOW HIGH-PITCHED BEEPING) (DIEGO GROANING SOFTLY) (BUTTON CLICKS) (RAPID HIGH-PITCHED BEEPING) (BUTTON CLICKS) (RAPID HIGH-PITCHED BEEPING) (BUTTON CLICKS) (RAPID HIGH-PITCHED BEEPING) (PANTING SOFTLY) (DOOR CLUNKS) - Good morning. - Good morning. MARY: The red and white blood cell counts are practically zero. The donor has reacted very well to the production accelerators of cells that will be used for his transplant. Everything's going fine. ANTONIO: What's this treatment you're giving me? 'Cause all I do is sleep. MARY: Oh, that's perfectly normal. LIVIA: I see him in so much pain at night, and I'm not sure if he understands what I'm saying. MARY: I think he does. Mr. Fairman, I'm Dr. Mary Flowers. We're here looking after you. Do you understand what I'm saying? See, he does understand. That's about it. All we can do now is wait. I've got to think of my family. I have children to raise. So, what if I die? I am a real estate agent in the suburbs. My brother is a famous movie director. You're crazy. You don't know what you're talking about. You know he's going to die if we don't do the transplant. I don't care. He doesn't talk to me. To this day, he blames for father's death. Now that he needs me, he remembers that I exist. I already told you, I want a million dollars, or I'm going home tomorrow. I want a check of a million in my wife's hands, or I'm not doing the transplant. But you know we don't have that sort of money. You know that. What do you mean? How much that house you live in worth? (HIGH-PITCHED BEEPING) (DOOR CLACKS) Who the fuck are you? Out. Out, out! Are you crazy? I can't understand where all this hatred is coming from. We grew up together, we shared everything. We're blood brothers for God's sake. All that he has, he worked for. He never stole anything. MARY: We've reduced the morphine dosage, which was very high. He'll feel pain again, but there's nothing we can do. At high levels, the morphine can cause a lack of oxygen in his blood and this may lead to a cardio respiratory arrest. (SOMBER MUSIC) I got the money. Tomorrow, it'll be in your wife's hands. But think about it, what's your brother going to think when he finds out you charged a million dollars to save his life? (MACHINE CREAKING) Mind if I smoke? First time in the States? No. Been here many times. MAN: How'd you find out you were sick? I was having dinner with some friends, one of their wives was a doctor. She saw something ugly on my neck and she said, "I don't like this." When they finished the procedure, it was much bigger than they expected. They put me to sleep and when I woke up, there was a doctor there telling me it was very serious. It's just like that. Always the same. You never know what's gonna happen tomorrow. Who are you? I came to take you. DIEGO: Take me, where? What if I told you I don't want to go? That's what they all say. What am I supposed to do? - What I'd like to know is: Why me? There's no logic. Maybe someone denounced you. I just obey orders. I'd like to speak to your supervisor. Sounds like you want to complicate things. But I should tell you, if you don't come with me now, old age is pretty ridiculous and undignified. Who do you work for? A multinational enterprise. We are market leaders. Market, what market is that? Market. The market is the market. DIEGO: And who invented that market? The market was created by the market itself. Back to the caveman days, when a man exchanged something with another man, they created the market. And profit drives the market. And you cannot argue with that because profit is sacred. God's behind everything. I don't get extra money for philosophy classes. Shall we? I'd like to brush my teeth before leaving. You mind? And who is she? NURSE: Oh, that's Sissy. My little girl. She's been with me since she was born. She looks very much like her mother. (NURSE CHUCKLES) NURSE: Everyone tells me that. Same eyes. (NURSE CHUCKLES) (MACHINE BEEPING) NURSE: August the 6th. Remember the date well. From now on, it's going to be your new birthday. And now, what do I do? NURSE: There's nothing you can do. Now it's up to him. (TOILET FLUSHING) This woman, who is she? I don't know. It's a woman who follows me around the whole goddamn time. She's stuck on me. I never told her "I love you" and I never said to her "I don't love you." Since we're gonna be together forever, could you tell me where we're heading - after we leave here? - Hold on, wait a second. Who said forever? Is there something else that you don't want to tell me? I just don't know. They never told me, and I never asked. Look, I'm only doing this because it's steady work, right? I get my paycheck, vacation, and, this year, a bonus trip to Disneyland for good work. What does "good work" mean? (MAN SIGHS) Cannot say. Not authorized. My contract has a confidentiality clause. I just do my job. I show up, no questions, don't talk to anyone. When my boss arrives, I hide so I don't have to say good morning. I'm afraid he'll fire me. I spend hours staring at the wall outside my window. When they remember me, they ask me to go and fetch someone. You know, it's a job I'd rather not do. Why do you do it, then? You have a family to support? I have no family, no house, no one. (WOMAN CHUCKLES) I have a son, but we had a fight and we don't talk anymore. I think he's a skydiver. I just have this extremely jealous woman who always wants to know what I do, who I talk to, where I go. You know how women are, right? I guess so. MAN: I'm a happy man. What about you? Me? Only on Mondays. (MAN LAUGHS) What do you do? DIEGO: I'm a film director. Wow. Wow. Super. Are you famous? I used to be. In my town, there was a cinema, but I never went. Now, it's an evangelical church. Do you play chess? (HIGH-PITCHED BEEPING) LIVIA: Doctor, he's back. Say something, my love. (RAPID HIGH-PITCHED BEEPING) What's happening? Does he have a fever, is he cold, what is it? MARY: Would you get some warm blankets, please? LIVIA: What's going on? MARY: We have to stop this infection as quickly as possible. So, we'll be starting on a broad-spectrum antibiotic, and take him to intensive care immediately. (SOMBER PIANO MUSIC) (DIEGO BREATHING LOUDLY) (MACHINE BEEPING) DR. ISAAC: His blood pressure's falling. The oxygen level is very low, and his heartbeat is weak. We're unable to contain the infection, and we may lose the patient. (GENTLE PIANO MUSIC) (LIVIA CRYING SOFTLY) I'm Dr. Feffer and I'm Jewish, as I believe you are. My whole family died in the Warsaw ghetto, and I was brought up in an orphanage in London, where I graduated in medicine. I emigrated to the United States, and I'm one of the founders of this institute. We've won a Nobel Prize for our research into blood. So, here, we believe only in science. But my years of experience as a doctor have also taught me that those who still have a dream to fulfill, have a better chance of survival. MAN: So dark here. Can I turn on the light? (SWITCH CLICKS) You like soccer? Not really. And you? I did when I was a boy. I was the goalkeeper. But one day, the ball hit me in the face, and I quit that shit. Never wanted to play again. That makes two of us. Tell me, is there life after death? As I told you, I know nothing. I lied to you when I said I'd never been to the cinema. I saw a film of yours. Do you remember which one? Well, I don't remember the name, but I never forgot a scene with a big boy sitting, fully dressed, in a woman's arms, being breastfed. Can I ask you something? Would it be too much to ask you to fetch me some other time? I still want to make one more film. What film is that? Is it a film to badmouth me? No, I have nothing against you. I just don't want to die. I still want to make another film. Can't you take someone else? I've enjoyed meeting you. Never had a chance to meet an artist before. You're real people. You're someone like us. I'll say I couldn't find you. Check.

While you're here, I want you to be comfortable. I've made all the arrangements, you're staying at our place. You'll have everything you need. Just wait until you see what we've done with your bedroom. I'm so happy you're coming. You're gonna love it. On Friday, we're organizing a charity dinner for the children of Africa. Hey, they've just got outta hospital. Give them a break. It's always the same with you. I can't say a god damn word without him getting mad at me. I mean, it's so revolting that while we have so much, there are millions of children in Africa who haven't enough to eat, which is why I decided to have this dinner, to raise funds to help them. Leslie, he's an artist. Stop bugging him with politics. But it's not about politics. It's about starving children. Each guest will pay $10,000 not to eat. Five meals will be served, and each meal you miss, you pay another 2,000. My idea is that at the end of the dinner, you'll feel so hungry that you'll actually know what those kids are going through. And that will give you the right to sponsor a child who'll then write to you, and the money will pay for his basic needs and education. Just listen to this. This way. From now on, this is your home. Let's go see the room I got ready for you. Huh? How about that? I bought it in an auction. It's from the set of a '30s movie with Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire. Hope you like it. You are one bighearted son of a bitch. Thank you. The first film I ever saw, I was about your age. It was a black and white film. It was night, a frightened girl was running along a deserted breach, and she was looking behind her like someone was chasing her. She wore a tight sweater, a black belt, and a full skirt which billowed in the wind. There was a group of boys in a car. They were drinking, laughing, shouting. She was running away, scared of them. Their car got closer and closer, and then she fell, exhausted. The car circled around her, the boys were laughing and shouting. And then the car stopped. And one of the boys went to her. She started crying, desperately. Sitting in the sand. And what happened to her? You know, I don't remember, but I do remember that when she got home, she went in the backdoor. She went in and saw her parents watching television in the living room, and then she crept upstairs to her bedroom so she wouldn't be seen.

I don't know what you're talking about. Didn't you go there and come back? DIEGO: Go where? Didn't you die and come back? Yes, I did die, but only for an instant. What is it like there? Anything you can tell us? I didn't get to heaven. I only got as far as purgatory. That's where they judge what we do on Earth.

(MIMICS WIND BLOWING) In the distance, we see a little house and there's a bright yellow light coming from the window. A door bangs loudly. (DOOR CLACKS) (DOOR CREAKS) In the bedroom, a baby sleeps in his crib. Nice and warm, under his blanket, he's thinking of his pony who must be cold. He crawls down the stairs and he goes outside. Crawls through the snow and all the way to the stable, where he sees his pony lying in the straw, looking up at him, freezing to death. He covers him. He turns to go back, but he can't find the house because it's covered with snow. He has nowhere to go. He's lost. He finds a path, starts to crawl on it, faster and faster because it's so cold. And then, all of the sudden, he sees the light of the sun coming up from behind the village. He crawls all the way to the village, very hungry. He crawls down the deserted main street until he gets to the bakery. He goes in, and there, he looks up and he sees a frightening man with a mustache who says, "What do you want, little boy?" "I'm hungry." "I'd like a bottle of hot chocolate." "Do you have any money?" the man says. "No." "Well, if you have no money," "then you must go some place else." "We have no hot chocolate for you here." And then, all of the sudden, his father comes in, picks his son up in his arms, and placing a 10-ruble bill on the counter, he says, "I want you to get a nice bottle" "of hot chocolate for my son." You're being well-looked after. Your mother's here, your friends are taking good care of you, you don't need me anymore, okay? (HELICOPTER WHIRRING) We're at war, we're at sea. The sea is rough.

DIEGO VOICEOVER: When I'd get home from school, after lunch, I used to move the hands of the kitchen clock to 3:00 p.m., the time of the first show at the cinema. But when I got there, the cinema was still closed, so I'd look at the movie posters, imagining their stories. One night, returning home, I saw a bright light at the end of the street. When I got closer, I saw a long track on the ground with an enormous camera mounted on top, coming in my direction. On the far side of the camera, it was pouring rain, and there was a man with a long raincoat and a hat, soaking wet, cigarette in his mouth, walking alongside the camera towards a mysterious woman waiting for him in the rain. When he reached her, the camera stopped and moved closer. She started crying and then she kissed him passionately. (SINGING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) (ELEGANT PIANO MUSIC) The play's main character was my age, and was saying goodbye to his mother and sister through a window, without being heard. He told them to forgive him for abandoning them. But that he had to leave, otherwise he'd stay forever. The next day, I took a bus and left, and I only came back 20 years later. (BIRD CHIRPING) It's good to have you back home, sir. Good to see you too, Ademir. (LIVIA MOANING) (GENTLE PIANO MUSIC) I'm doing research with HIV prisoners in Carandiru jail. One cell, made for four, there are 17. Sex and drugs are nonstop. A needle is used on at least four arms, and rates of infection are high. They have sex in jail, are infected, and then on Sundays, they see their wives for conjugal visits, and infect them. You should write about that. Don't you think it's a supremely insignificant in the history of humanity that you ran eight seconds faster than you did 20 years ago? We're never gonna have another Fellini film, think of that. That's what matters. Today, I tripped on the street, fell down and couldn't get up again. I had to ask for help. I never felt so humiliated in all my life. I can't take care of you the whole time. I don't need you to take care of me. Well, that's great to know now 'cause that's what I've been doing all these years. It was you, your work, your illness. I've always stood beside you. Do you mean you no longer want to be beside me? I'm not answering that question. I thought that if I stood beside you, you'd survive. It was at the hospital that I realized that your life didn't depend on my love. And that freed me. Your life belongs only to you. Now I have to take care of mine. You're just saying that because we haven't fucked for five years, aren't you? LIVIA: Come on. And I thought that your understanding was the greatest demonstration of love you could give me. Seeing someone? You want to leave me? LIVIA: You haven't understood a thing. Tell the truth. That's what you miss, isn't it? It's not cock that I miss. It's my turn now to be the person I left behind when I fell in love and decided to live with you. And I won't do without that anymore, even if it means leaving you. If that's what you want, go ahead. Make up your mind! You know, when I see you naked, I no longer desire you. If I don't turn you on anymore, then that's your problem. DIEGO: Oh, you're just a whore. Now that I can barely walk, you tell me this?! I can't stand you asking why I did this, why I did that! I don't want your illness anymore, your smell of medication. I want my life back. (LIVIA YELPS) Get away from me! (DIEGO GRUNTING) Dona Sebastiana! (LIVIA YELPING) Get out of here! DIEGO: Open the door! Help me, Dona Sebastiana. I don't want to see you anymore! (SOMBER PIANO MUSIC) (LOUD TAP) (TAPPING) (FRENZIED PIANO MUSIC) (SOMBER PIANO MUSIC) (CAR HORN HONKING) (DOOR THUDS) I don't want to go out. SECURITY: Go and fuck at your place! You can't come back here! WOMAN: You are a real son of a bitch! Fuck off. WOMAN: You would actually love to fuck us, right? SECURITY: Whatever, bitch. Are you okay? (UPBEAT DANCE MUSIC) Hey, you. What are you looking at? Never saw a woman before? (DIEGO MOANING) Fuck me. Fuck me. (WOMAN MOANING) What? Do you prefer boys? No. (WOMAN MOANS) (WOMAN MOANING) (KEYBOARD TAPPING) My Hindu friend, tonight, I was driving and thought of you. How are you? Are you alive? I feel like I'm dying, but no one says anything. Since the transplant, have you felt your life has gone back to normal? Yes, no, or more or less? Yes. Have you had problems in your personal relationships? No. DOCTOR: Have you been able to do the things you did before the transplant? Yes. Do you worry about what the future will bring? Yes. Well, no. No. DOCTOR: Do you have thoughts about the possibility of death? No. DOCTOR: Have you had problems in your sex life? No. Are your erections strong enough to achieve penetration? Yes. DIEGO VOICEOVER: Dear Dr. Ricardo Steen, thank you for referring your patient, Diego Fairman. During his treatment, he underwent a bone marrow transplant for an aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. According to our records, after five years, the patient is considered in good health and free of disease. The patient now will be under the care of the doctor of his choice. Our recommendations for the longterm followup are attached in this letter. Don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions. Best regards, Mary Flowers. (SOMBER PIANO MUSIC) ASSISTANT: Camera rolling. DIRECTOR: Action. You're the film director. I think you were friends with my grandfather. I don't think so. Maybe your father. My father? I don't think so. Got my permit to shoot my film. Good luck.

It's good to come back home, isn't it? I know you blame me for Father's death. I'm so ashamed of everything I did. I was so naive. First, they let me win, and then they took all the money, which wasn't mine, it was Father's. It was all he had. I went crazy when you were dying. I tore up the check. When I touched it, it burned it my hand. You don't owe me an explanation. We've all done things we'd rather not have done. I didn't stay for Father's funeral. I grew up without knowing where you were until Father's death. It's me who needs to apologize. I abandoned you when you needed me the most. I left Father alone when he was sick and out of work. I only thought of myself. Just think, all the blood running through my body is yours. Then you're fucked, man. I hate you. I hate your father, and you're just like him. Everything revolves around you. It's been like that my whole life. (SIGHS) I remember that day in Seattle in your friend's house, when I brought you tea, you were so rude. You shouted at me, "Go away, Mother, go away." "Can't you see I'm writing my film?" I knew then that you would live. (ZESTFUL PIANO MUSIC) DIEGO VOICEOVER: Diego is alone and staring at the walls. Empty walls. He has hit rock bottom. Interior, night. Ricardo tells Diego how he escaped death from yellow fever. They toast to death. She interrupts. I'd like to make a toast. RICARDO: Yeah. To death, who hasn't taken us yet. Excuse me. I'm sorry to interrupt, but I know who you are. I wanted to tell you I've seen all your films. I know who you are. I saw you on that reality show. I can't believe it. Did you watch that shitty show? Not only did I watch it, I voted for you. Thank you. I'm an actress, and I'd like to invite you to see my play. (SINGING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) I'm starving. Take me to dinner? When I was born, my mother was very sick. They told me only one of us would survive. We lived in a very small city with no hospital. An ambulance would come three times a week, and take her for treatment in a city nearby. I remember coming home from school and waiting till night fall for the ambulance to bring her back. Never knew if she would come or not. How old were you? Six, seven, I don't remember. She would say that when she died, she would return as a flycatcher bird. (GENTLE MUSIC) So, one day, the ambulance took her and she never came back. I was by myself at home for two days. No one came to tell me anything. I ate all the cookies in the kitchen pantry, packed my bags and left. DIEGO: And your father? My dad died when I was little. They told me he ate a lot of cucumbers before going to sleep that night. (WOMAN CHUCKLES) When I got to Sao Paulo, the very next day, I got a job as a Barbie doll on a TV commercial. I wanted to be an actress. I heard you've been very ill, is that true? Everyone asks that. It's a long story. (WOMAN MOANING) I was 17 when I left home on a cargo ship for Europe. I wanted to be a film director. I worked a lot in movies as an extra. Sometimes, I can see myself on television at 4:00 a.m. on a spaghetti western. (BOTH CHUCKLE) I didn't want to come home. But, one day, my mother wrote me and said I couldn't come home. They'd arrest me because I didn't do my military service. So, I came to Brazil because it was the nearest country. I still wanted to work in the movies. So, one day, I was visiting a production office and I went in, and no one was there. They were out making a movie. The phone rang, I picked it up. It was an advertising agency, they wanted to make a commercial showing the town lit up for Christmas. That was my first job as a director. (WOMAN CHUCKLES) Then I met my wife, and everything changed. I started making movies until an illness stopped me, and I spent years doing nothing. And when was that? It's not over yet. MAN: Good morning. DIEGO: You again? Yeah. I was passing by and decided to visit you. I have some good news. Our company was bought by a group of Israeli investors. They thought I was too old, and fired me. Now, you're a free man. What about your wife? I took retirement, and we separated. She was too jealous. (MAN SIGHS) Nowadays, I answer to no one. If the weekend comes along and I feel like fishing, I just go. So, you gonna make that film you promised? I already am. Am I in it? Yes, you are. MAN: Who's gonna play me? I don't know yet. Well, what happens next in the story is up to you. I got to go.
