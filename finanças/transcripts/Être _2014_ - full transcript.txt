Calm down, calm down! What's this? What the fuck is that? You gonna shoot me? What are you doing with this? Stop! Police! Stop! Existence is a word that each person describes with their own experience. What's important is the meaning that one gives it. BEING 18 hours earlier... When you pull someone over and you check or caution them, you're doing more than any of those guys in suits. We work directly with real life. Do you know why people hate us? Go ahead, tell me. They think we're pushing them deeper into their holes, and that makes us hate them too. It's all a vicious circle. Who will change their tune first? Why are you still a cop then? - Were you scared? - More than yesterday. Come on, hurry up and get dressed. Hey, how's it going? I'd like to get far away from here. I dare you. You're such an idiot, Félicien! - I'm your fan. - Get out. - Take me to school. - I'm busy. Mum said you had to. HOME DELIVERIES BAKER AND CONFECTIONER He can go to school alone. Darling, it's just a little detour. She wants to meet up with her lover. - Shut it. - Ester, be polite. Where's your communion necklace? I lost it. I'm leaving in 5 minutes. Be ready. I won't wait for you! Right, that's enough, Diego. Come on, finish your cereal. Hello, Fatima. Hello, who are you? Mohamed. Don't you remember? Yes, you're the cook. I like eating in your restaurant. I can't stand seeing this concrete wall anymore. As long as we're together, that's what's important. Yeah. As long as we're together. Did anyone in your training group become pros? - A few I'm sure. - Who? I don't remember, that was 30 years ago. Why won't you train us? The other guy is rubbish. Don't talk like that, Diego, OK? With my night shifts, I don't have the time. Listen to your trainer, that's his job. Do you think Mum will come to the match Saturday? There you go, that's better. Right, work hard. - Stop here, please. - You've got to take me to the gate. I don't have the time. Act like a baby and we'll treat you like one. Can I have your iPod for school? You better not break it. Stop! Right, are you getting out or not? It's fine, go on. - Is the BMW finished? - Yeah. Oil change, pads and I even fixed the injection. This afternoon you've got the Clio. And stop overdoing it. I've got a timetable to stick to. I'm out of baguettes. Ah, Christian, you're back at last. Darling, the bread, please. We'll be here for the transition. As long as it stays in the family. - We will miss you. - That's nice to hear. - Hello. - Hello. I hope your bread will be as good when your parents are retired. Have a nice day, bye. Bye, see you tomorrow. I'm off. - Mum? - Yes, darling? No, nothing. See you later. - Hello, Christian. - Hello. - Ah, hello, Madam. - Hello. I'd like 3 eclairs. - Good evening. - Thanks. He's been shot. Prepare the theatre, quickly! - Stay here, Madam. - I want to be with my grandson. They'll take care of him. They know what they're doing. I want to be with him. It will all be OK. Inch Allah. It will be fine. What are you doing here? Yes. - What? - What you asked me yesterday. I've thought about it, I'm OK with it. Really? You will come and live with me? Are you sure, jokes aside? I'm sure. I didn't sleep all night. From now on, I'm driving. - Really? - Yeah. Oh, it's you. - What time is it? - 9:30am. Oh, shit! Oh, shit. I'm exhausted. Maybe it's time to tell everyone. Yeah, I know. I keep thinking about it. Don't worry, it will be fine! Who rattled your cage, idiot? You're not the only one here! Can't you see we're blocked in? Can you open it? - I've got to tell you... - I'm leaving. - Already? - This village, I mean. I'm going crazy here. This is new. No, not really. I've been here for 23 years and haven't gone anywhere. I can't even spend money. - It's a boring old routine. - Thanks. You know what I mean. I'm a baker's son who will become a baker. What fun, right? A while ago I started chatting with a girl online. She's from Paris. We're the same. I feel like I've known her forever. Are you in love? Nothing like that. It's virtual. What happens to us? It was all clear, we never promised each other anything. Yeah... We fuck just like that, to pass the time. - Why are you saying that? - What? You got me out of bed to say you're leaving me. Juliette, you're my best friend. - Just leave, then. - What? What do you want? What? Get out! Get out of here. I'm on the train, I'll be there in 3 hours. Here, I found this at mine. It's yours, I think. Listen, I'm sorry about my reaction. I panicked, I was scared. I thought you had a more open mind. - For a teacher, that's funny. - You know... Being your teacher, this type of relationship is trouble. Anything else? So? What did the sexiest uni teacher want from you? - Just the time, Madam. - The time? My parents are out of town, fancy dinner? - What about a party? - Cool. Hey, watchmaker! Holy shit, Serge! You dirty bastard! How are you, Momo? - You look good. - Sun is better for me than prison. You really look like a grease monkey. It was time I came back to look after you. I'll take you home. 2 tickets for tonight's match, are you interested? No football talk. That's my Francky. He gets straight to the point. So I've studied your project for a show. - Did you like it? - It's not bad. Whisky, gentlemen. Franck, listen. It's true that your concept is innovative. The channel is interested, but let's make things clear, you're all burnt out. No one wants to see you on the TV. We are willing to offer you a big cheque for the rights. This sum will let you live the good life. Wait, hold on... It's my show! It was my idea! We will make you a millionaire. What more can you want? You're no longer hip. They need new blood. Do what everyone else does, write a book! But you've got to forget about TV. You're dumping me, just like that. If you like our proposition, come to the office tomorrow. Do you know how hard I worked to get where I am? For fuck's sake, if I'm not on TV anymore I'll die! Have you made your choice? I'll have my usual. Have what you want, Franck. I'll pick up the cheque. - Things are working out for you. - I can't complain. When you went down I had to be discreet, but I'm back now. You didn't dobb me in, Momo. I haven't forgotten. That was a long time ago. Are you kidding? You spent 4 years in prison. 4 years, you don't forget that. Don't you remember? You were king here. You had money in your pocket and a woman on each arm. All that shit is over now. I'm married, you know. What, to Lisa? Did she wait for you? - She's pregnant. - No! A mini Momo. I'm happy for you, brother, really, that's great. You have a family now. You can't make do with being a mechanic. You're worth more than that. Uncle Serge has come bearing gifts. Here, there's 10,000. Take it, don't make me angry. It's not charity. - It's an investment. - What are you talking about? I'm partner in a business in Spain, a legal business. It's a restaurant, casino and nightclub. I need someone I can trust to deal with security. I owe you one. If you fancy it, I'll set it up for you to become partner for 30,000. It will let you start over. - How's your mum doing? - She's getting old. You get old better in the sun, believe me. Call me, it's all above board. Yeah. Right, see you mate. So then, how many people should we invite? What about a fancy-dress party? No, that's rubbish. Yeah, and no one would bother anyway. I'm going to get dressed up. I'm going to invite Max and Pierre-Louis. - They're hot. - Totally. Especially Pierre-Louis. He was only 2 years old when he came to France. At first he didn't talk at all. Perhaps he saw something that shocked him in his country. Or maybe he didn't understand why his new parents were white. He spent hours in my room watching and saying nothing. They sent him to a specialist but that changed nothing. After 4 years, the first word he said was my name, Ester. He's so chatty now. He's 10 years old, he's called Félicien, he's my brother and this morning, you saved his life. It has been ages since anyone has spoken to me like I'm a human being. You shouldn't be ashamed of them, they show your strength. They prove that you're a survivor. I had a family too. - What day is it tomorrow? - The 5th. Never make promises you can't keep. OK. I wrote you a letter to thank you. But read it only when I have gone. "4pm in The British Pub." - Hi. - Hi. Your mum didn't eat again. I'll go see her soon. I can't take the routine anymore and this dirty job. - It's like still being in prison. - Our life is not that bad. Your dirty job pays the bills. That's the problem, we barely survive. With the baby and my mum, we've no room. If you had the chance to live elsewhere, I don't know, like in Spain for example... I would love that. We all dream, but it's not real. Isn't life all about dreaming? Shit! It's always about having enough money. Shit! Excuse me. - Hey, boys? - Did you call us boys? He just called us boys. - Boys. - What's up with you, homeboy? How does this work? - You're not from here. - Not yet. High five. Nothing's better than Pari PSG, the Parc des Princes... Come here. - Let's see the dough. - What? - The gravy, your cash. - OK. - What's the cost? - Let's see. - Here. - Thanks. Spin the wheel, bing, one ticket, bing, validate it, the receipt, who gives a shit? Put the coin in and wait nicely for it to spit out the winning ticket. Thanks. Here you go mate. But it only works for one journey. - OK. - Let's go. Thanks, mates. You start off with boys and finish with mates. You're already a Parisian, homeboy. Catch you later! Bye, mate. - Your change. - Thanks. Hello, Jess? Yeah, it's Momo, the watchmaker. Yeah, I know, it's been ages. Yeah fine. Listen, I want to get back to business, the old business. Do you have the equipment? That depends, what's the plan? Tonight? Are you sure? I don't know. I have to think about it. OK, I'll let you know ASAP. Bye. "Very cold when it's absolute." In 4 letters. Hello. Hello, young man. Can I help you? I'd like a room. A room for my young friend. For how long? I'm going to travel, so just one night. - Zero. - Sorry? Well, yes. "Very cold when it's absolute." It's zero, like the temperature. Another line that couldn't beat me. Will you leave your ID, or will you pay right now? I'll leave the ID and pay tomorrow. OK. Room 13. You're not superstitious are you? I'm too happy to be superstitious. Bravo. Cathy? Shit, what have you done? No, not this! Shit, this isn't happening! Cathy! Shit! Come on! Come on! Come on, hold on. There you go. Spit it out! Spit! Throw it up! That's good. Breathe, breathe. Wait. It'll be alright. Stop using this. I'll take you to hospital. - Yes. - No. No, not the hospital. If you take me there, you'll never come back for me. OK, not the hospital. Calm down, my love. I'll take care of you. - Thanks. - Hello. Hello. - Have you finished here? - Yeah, it's done. You can help the old guy then. He can't manage the electronics. Long live retirement. - Boss! - Huh? Can I have a car tonight? It's important. No car is allowed out. That's the rule. Hello? No, I'm not sleeping. Why do you need a car? Shit, man, you're dodgy. Are you serious? OK. OK, I'll see. Who was that? Can I borrow your car this evening? No. Come on, please. Shit, you're annoying. I'll have to take the metro. What do you need it for? I've got to take a mate to the airport. Make sure you're careful. I always am. Hello. - What can I get you? - A beer, thanks. Ester? Christian? - Well, hi. - Hi. - How are you? - Good, yourself? I pictured your face but I didn't think you were so... Black? No, no, radiant. Thanks, that's nice. You're the first black person I've know. - That's good. - Oh, shit. I just meant that in my village, there aren't that many. I didn't think you'd leave the countryside just like that. It was the heat of the moment. You're a poet. Why did you want to meet here? I don't do business outside! It's an emergency. Here are 2 VIP seats for the Champions' League match tonight. I need to be forgiven. I don't do football, and don't talk shop over the phone. If you want me, come to the house. That's enough, give it here. - That looks like the TV guy. - Franck Caro? Yes, that's the one. Welcome to Paris. So where are we going? Wherever, as long as it's far from here. Aren't you scared to leave with a stranger? Why should I be scared? You look like a nice boy. Let's do it whilst we're still young. Did you tell anyone? They wouldn't understand. When do we leave? Tomorrow, tonight let's party. What's the program? A friend is having a party in her fla I can send you the address. I can't believe this is happening. I've got to get my little brother from school. - Till tonight, then? - OK. - Cool, bye. - Bye. Sir? Sir? Sir, wake up. Holy shit. Wake up, hey! Can you hear me? Sir? 100, weak but not dangerous. This will relax you a bit. Try to get some rest for now. - Thanks for coming so quickly. - Goodbye. Diego! Sorry for being late. I've worked my big lob, my little lob and my punt. - Where? In maths class? - Well, no, at playtime. Hi. I found this in your room. And? Shall I tell you how they work? Ester, that's not funny. You're only 20. Would you rather I don't use them? I would have liked you to talk to me... Why, for a mother-daughter chat? We never talk about anything together. - I hate this. - You must be patient. Patience has nothing to do with it. She's worse than a kid. - Put her in a hospital. - Hey! She's my mother. Sorry, that's not what I meant. What if she takes it out on the baby? She would never do that, even if she didn't know he was family. The family was living in great uncertainty in... Are you hungry? - A bit. - Wait, I'll help you. Is it good? Yes. It reminds me of when I was in the mountains, with my mother in the evening. Does your mum make you soup too? Yes, she taught me how. A TV star ending up like this, it's sad. Do you know if he has family? Not that I know of. I haven't read celebrity magazines for years. Do you think he'll wake up? His body's worn out by drugs. Who can say? He could wake up in 5 minutes or 10 years. The brain is a vast labyrinth. Can I have a yogurt? I'll get you one. When will Mum come back and eat with us? When she's no longer ill. What's her illness? Sorrow. That's not an illness. It can be. It's her birthday tomorrow. Think about a gift, it will make her happy. What do you think? I don't know what she likes anymore. I shouldn't have to ask to go out, I'm old enough. You've got class tomorrow. In this family, there are rules. What family? We do nothing as a family. We never talk, we never laugh. You think you know me, but you don't. Even I don't know who I am. I don't remember where I'm from. I do know that it's not easy for you. How do I feel, then? You're not my mum. Christian, it's me, Juju. I didn't want to say this via voicemail. But I guess you must be really busy with your new life. I'm pregnant. It's yours of course, in case you were wondering. I'm not asking for anything. Even I don't know if I want to keep it. I just wanted you to know. They say, "out of sight out of mind", but sometimes it's the opposite. I miss you. ESTER 17 rue mezieres, saint-sulpice metro Mum, are you asleep? I made you some dinner. You shouldn't be sad anymore. Daddy has become sad too. I don't want to become sick like both of you. We used to laugh a lot. I hope you'll be better soon. Sleep well, lovely Mum. Where were you? I went home to change. - We said 9pm. - Yeah, I know. - I've got to tell you something. - You didn't find a car? - Don't worry, it's fine. - Let's go. Come on. - It's this one. - What, this piece of crap? You asked for a car, here it is. - Not Barbie's car. - What? - Is Ken pissed? - Stop it. Switch it on. "Denfert-Rochereau". Ah, "Saint-Sulpice". Home A couple and their son have been killed in Saône-et-Loire, victims of carbon-monoxide poisoning. Their electricity was cut off. The world is even uglier through this window. Good night, Cathy. - What a palace. - Shhh. Holy shit, my mum loved this guy. Come here, we're not in the Louvre. Shine the torch here. You've got the combination! - The bag! - Oh, jackpot! - A quick in and out. - Momo, I have to tell you something. Let's not hang around. - What are you doing? - I'm coming. Listen, I'm in the metro, I can't hear you. I'll call you back tomorrow. Lots of love. Shit. Shit! Holy shit! What an idiot! All right? Can I have some? I'm here, I'm waiting for you, I hope you can find the place... Where are you? You're not replying. What are you dressed as? As black, can't you see? Well, you've done well. I mean you're pretty. I can't be doing with your crap. Go do your number on someone else, there are other girls. You're pretty. I like your face... You have a pretty face. I'm not a seducer. I do maths. Well, I have mates who do maths that... They're pros with women and all. Would you like a drink? I can get one. Don't just sit here, have fun. Are you still waiting for Romeo? Never make a promise you can't keep. What? Nothing, forget it. Be careful, it's strong. - Who's he? - Don't worry, he's with me. - So? - It was a long walk. But not a prison walk. 67,400. Nice. Here. Your 20%. Don't you want a bit of merchandise? Like I said, it's just a one-off. My door is always open in case you change your mind. It's illegal to drive and phone. You piss everyone off. I just picked up. Are you having a laugh? You've been on the phone for 5 minutes. The station's there if you prefer. I've been sworn in. Insulting an officer mean anything to you? Let this be a lesson to you. Would it kill them to be a bit nicer? 150 euros a smile, it's expensive. There's no respect. He was taking me for an idiot. I'm not sorry. Come on. They never made a Ken burglar doll with a hat. You've really helped me out with this little job. You're welcome, mate. What will you do with the money? I don't know. - I'd like to live in the south. - Oh, yeah? I think I'll make a family. What? Do you want to buy a family? That's not funny. Well, you a dad, holy shit! Look at you. You're as responsible as a 10-year-old. Your mum still makes your bed. You're going to have to grow up a bit and find a good woman. Real women aren't everywhere. I'm telling you the truth. - There's no music. - That's what I wanted to say. We've known each other since school. You're family. - You really are family. - Yeah. What are you doing with my sister's car? This is the CD I got Sabrina for her birthday. What's it doing here, then? - Hold on, I can explain. - Shit! We haven't spoken for 3 years and you have her car. Are you doing her? Speak nicely, shit! You didn't support her after the fight. She could barely take it all. We're together, it's not just a fling. I love her, for Christ's sake! - What's happening? - I'm not a mechanic. What you're missing is a brain. You forgot to fill it up. - I'm sorry, mate. - You're always sorry. Can't you be competent for once? Seriously? Rue Guisarde, no, that's not it. Shit, where is it? - Sorry.. - I don't smoke. No, I'm looking for a street, I don't know where it is. There's a party. Like I know all the parties around here. Come and look at the view. I've got a really sore head. It's in moments like these that one feels alive. In fact, I'm talking shit. Shit. Fucking hell! What's all this about my sister? You've not wanted to hear from her in 3 years, and now you care. Calm down, calm down! What's this? What the fuck is that? You gonna shoot me? Holy shit, what is that? Why have you got this? Stop! Police! Stop! He's like Usain Bolt, the motherfucker. For fuck's sake! Shit! Is it this one? Yes, it's this one. Shit, what an idiot. Shit. - Drop it. - Put the gun away first. Drop the gun. - Put your gun away first. - Drop the gun. What have I done? Ester! Oh, shit! - What happened? - You've been shot. - Can you help me up? - Yeah. - Are you ready? - Yeah, it's fine. This is your fault. Now you know about my handicap, you must see me differently. I still want to go away with you. I don't think it's such a good idea after all. What do you mean? I thought leaving would rid me of my problems, but I think I'm the real problem, so... Why do you say that? It's too complicated. I don't want to bother you with my spoilt-child stuff. I'm sorry. You don't need to be. - Did you book a taxi? - Yes. Can I help? No, that's OK, I still have a spare leg. Shall I drop you off? No, I'll walk for a bit, go for a wander. - I didn't want to... - Don't worry. - Take care of yourself. - You too. Sir? Sir? Stop there please. Police! He's armed! Sir, drop the gun and it'll be fine. Drop the gun. I didn't mean to. Drop the gun. I didn't want to kill her. Sir, drop your gun and... That's Kinyarwanda. It's your mother tongue. It means that I love you like you were my own daughter. Are you leaving, then? I guess so. Where's the next destination? Where I've dreamed of living. If you say so. Where is that paradise, then? Your change! How's he doing? His spine is badly damaged. He'll survive, but I doubt he'll walk again. Do you need me for anything? No, thanks, Sabrina. You can go home. You see my girl, I kept my promise today. You're dressed in white, like a princess. Happy birthday, Cathy. Dad! Hello? Yes? Hold on. Mum? Mum! It's the phone. It's a doctor. Hello? Yes, speaking. Happy birthday, Mum. Where's Dad? Are you taking me to school today? Hi. Did you take care of my baby? What's going on? What's in that bag there? Marco, you're scaring me. What a beauty. Sabrina. - My girl. - Mum. Mum! to S.I-L.L BEING Subtitles: Eclair Group
