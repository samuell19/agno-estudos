They've been here since you left at about 10:00 this morning. And they haven't made a single move in three and one half hour. Why don't you get them out of here.

I'd take six or eight of them and throw them over my head backwards. [SQUAWKING] Well, three anyway. Who taught that parrot to do that? [COUGHING] Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. What would you eat a canary bird for anyway? [COUGHING] Hello Ooleota. Where have you been? Cutbert and I have [INAUDIBLE] Cuthbert, that sissy. How do you know? You've never even seen him. I don't have to see him. I never knew a Cuthbert in my life that wasn't wasn't a sissy. When I went to school as a kid, I licked every kid in school named Cuthbert. [LAUGHING] Shh. That kid's getting awfully fresh. [RINGING] Hey if that's for me, tell them I'm taking a bath. I'll call them up later. Hello? Oh hello Cuthbert. Am I surprised, Cuthbert. Am I? No, Cuthbert. Really, Cuthbert? Who told you that, Cuthbert? Someone had to tell him, he'dnever find that out himself. Really, Cuthbert? [LAUGHING] Oh, Cuthbert. Oh Cuthbert, that's very, very funny. Yeah tell it to us. Make us laugh too. Well am I surprised, Cuthbert. Yeah I bet you're surprised. Well tell me some more about it, Cuthbert. OK, this is getting too much. Tell her more.

I could paint one for you. I don't want a painted one. A person hasn't gotten any rights in this country anymore. The government even tells you what color stamps you're going to buy. It's pretty common. That's the Democratic Party for you. I have written to Washington about it. What do you want to write to Washington for? He's dead. [LAUGHING] How much are your stamps? Three cents. All right give me one. Thank you. No don't give me that dirty one, give me a clean one. Give me the one out of the middle. Oh. [WHISTLING] [SINGING] Sorry to keep you waiting.
