I had moved away and I ran back into him three years ago. - No, and didn't want to go. For what? To go fight a war with it that's not our doings? No, no. This is the war right here. This is the war, right here. United States, it's the war. The war is hunger, starving. You understand, people that are homeless. Too much. - Nine, 10, 11, 12. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. 18, 19, 20. 20, 21, 22. 28, 29, 30. 30, 31. - How you doing? My name is Nathaniel. Nathaniel Beuton. And something that you want to know, ask me. Well, basically I'm from Harlem. That's where I'm from. I was put out in the streets. You know, no where to go. Trying to earn a dollar. It's what you may call like a hustle. It's a few dollars in the pocket that keeps you going, and keeps you out of crime, all right. I started this when I was 25. I'm 54. - David. That's like, uh... Uh, you know... You know what I'm saying? - You got the knucklehead polices, yes. They will give you a hard time. Yes they will. Two months ago, I got a ticket. I got a $77 ticket just for doing this. Just for doing this, I got a $77 ticket. I done went to jail back to back, the 22nd and the 24th of this month, back to back. You can't even sleep out here. That's how bad it is now, you can't even sleep. You can't even sleep on the concrete no more, whatever, just out here and chill. They gonna lock you up. - Some people don't want to go to shelters. People are looking for an apartment where they can relax, rest, put a key in they door, say it's their own. Nobody wants to be in the streets. Nobody wants to be in the street. But to be in the streets is no joke, man. It's no joke. ♪ Will you please remember me ♪ ♪ We never never meet again ♪ ♪ Will you please remember me ♪ ♪ I'll always be your friend ♪ ♪ I want to go go back home ♪ ♪ I can't find my way ♪ ♪ I want to go back home ♪ ♪ Guess I'll get lucky one day ♪ - My name is fully Alvarez Arty Singleton. I was born in North New Jersey. Good old North New Jersey. I've been in New York 10 years. Yeah, I'm in Manhattan. Yes, I have a place. - I was, worked for a Data Communique, which was Metro Seliger, which was Accurate List Letter Service. They changed the name. And 38 years, I have very nice bosses and everything. I was a Supervisor. I have a pacemaker. I have a fibulator. Yep. Y'know, they just put me on disability, my doctor. I couldn't work no more. The social security doesn't give me enough. My pension, I've been working 38 years on one job. They don't give me enough money. So I had an opportunity to be in post office, and I didn't. That took away a lot of opportunities. Now I'm 67 years old, and trying to get a little money to keep my, keep me going. But I just depend on God. I don't depend on man. I depend on God, and God has seen me through. When I don't have nothing, he makes sure that I have a little something by doing this. - One time in the morning, I was standing by the door, about to get off shift, maybe an hour in. And I saw a lady. She was picking up the cans and bottles that were left over before the truck came. And there was a lot she wanted to take. So I see left, and then she came back. And she came back rolling up in a brand new car full of cans and bottles. - Y'all want to do me a favor? Yes. - Stay right there till I move my car, so I can get these bottles. Okay, don't let nobody get this spot. - 59. If I made... - When you first start out, you don't know which can is good, at which can is not good. But it's a good thing they started with the five cent on the water bottles. Because the water bottles are light. Actually, the city garbage cans, I really don't do that. Because you got dog poo, and this and that in there. My name is Peanut. I actually started recycling. My daughter is 21. I started recycling like 22 years ago. It wasn't straight through, it wasn't consecutive. It was like off and on. Whenever I was out of work, I knew that I could recycle. I started by the museum, because I would see busloads and busloads of people. So I got an idea. I said okay, cool. I'll take a clear plastic bag in the morning, and I'll put two or three cans in there. I'll go upstairs to the top of the museum, where they have the garbage can, and I'll put them bags there. That way people will know this is for cans. And before you know it, everybody was throwing their cans in. And I come out with four bags. I got famous for carrying four or five bags on my shoulder. You know, I was a girl. And so a lot of people was impressed by that, and, um... Actually it was enough to get me an apartment, after a few months or whatever. I saved every dime I made, besides taking out for something to eat. - I do what I do. I do what I do. I pick my cans up. I mind my business, I stay out of trouble. At least I'm not dead or in jail. My name is Eddie, and I live in Manhattan. I'm too old, 60. I can't run like these guys no more. I started doing this since about '88, in '88 when I came out of prison. God told me. He said, boy. You want to stay out of jail, you better find you something to do besides committing crimes. So he introduced me to this. Now I was in jail from '82 to '88. No, from '82 to '83, I was fighting my case. Six years. What a waste of time. But I can't complain. Some negative things were happening in my life. This is fun. Yeah! Where else could you get tax free money? Like here, every Sunday I come here. Most of the guys that recycle, they know. Don't come over here. Because it's the only place that I do on Sunday. And I will defend this spot, just like I own the land. Because here I get enough, generally, to carry me through for two or three days. So I get very very defensive, when people sort of think that I'm stupid, and they just want to try to take advantage. Nah, this is the only place I come. And I'm not gonna let you have it. I can't. - When I was 14 years old, I had gotten a summer job. Right? There was no other job that they couldn't find for me. So they asked me, they said, "Nathaniel." They said, "how good is your math?" I said well, I'm good. So they said would you be what they call a substitute helper, like for a teacher? I said, okay. But when I got nine grade, or something like that, I jumped out of school. - I was working. I was a case manager for people with HIV AIDS. And because of the economy, I lost that job. And that brought me back here. That's about being addicted to drugs. That's been off and on for years. But I've been clean now I'm... I've been clean for two years now. - Well, I had a job. I lost the job. I lost the job. I was working in Jersey. Costac Minache Road, wholesale, working for David Smalls. And um...I got fired. Why? - Because I was like, I didn't show up for three times. and I was late twice. But I was always there on my job, because I started doing garbage. Then I worked myself up to packing and invoice. And only been there less than a year. - I can do maintenance work, I do security work. I'm on the net, trying to find a suitable employer. Not easy to come by these days, when folks are holding back the money. And I only pick this, I only pick up the cans and bottles from out of my building. I don't go outside of that zone. It took me 10 bags to make $84. Over what time period? - Three months. Wow. How do you live? - My daughter. I supported her most of her life, now she supports me. At least until I finish doing what I need to do. See there's another side of life, other than just working. - Me personally, I do warehousing and security. I'm certified to drive a forklift. But they would give it to this guy, because he wanted to work for six dollars an hour. I stopped. I just quit. I quit. I come to the conclusion that I can't work for nobody. - I'm independent. I don't have to answer to anyone but me. Nobody tells me what to do. I know I should be doing better. And given enough time, I probably will. But I'm not gonna kill myself if I don't. I got this. No, I got this. I got one in the- You arms are longer than mine? That's to let the other canners know, that somebody's working in this building already, that somebody's here. They like that about us, that we don't break the bags open and get them tickets, y'know. - Like I have this guy, he's here. He lets me go downstairs and get the, help him with the garbage. I have a friend on a 103rd Street, little white guy. And I have a little friend, yeah I have friends. They help me out. I said the number to call to get into the show is 888-965-0440. Say what you want to say. I wasn't working for a long time. And God moved in less than a month. I got a part time position at a dealership, basically. And God moved in less than a month. - Warren, are you in yet? I'm going around the corner. Well, you could talk to me now. I'm gonna do this here. I'm gonna do this. I'm from Queens. I'm the President of my usher board, and I'm a Deaconess. Well, we go around and help, go around and see people if they're sick or whatever. And then we help with the communion. Like, I have a lady that goes to the Bronx. And she has cancer. And I take her every Wednesday to get chemotherapy. They pay me. Four o'clock in the afternoon, they put this out. So they can take the cans and the little plastic. But the majority of time, I take the bottles to a beer house in Jamaica. And you put them in the machine. I hear the truck. I want to try to get some of these out. What's a beer house? - A beer house. You don't know what a beer house? I know what a bar is. - A beer house. - No, I don't know what- - Where they have beer, they sell beer. What's where, where you been? How long you been in United States? Huh? You never been to a beer house, where they sell beer and soda. I don't. See that? You made me miss. You made me miss my stuff. You made me miss it. Go ahead. - Is this yours? - Yeah. No, go ahead. Take it. It's yours. See that? Y'all made me miss it. Getting interviewed and made miss my stuff. And y'all, when you start coming around this way? - It ain't made me no problems. - I got to go over there, 'cause the man's not there. - We're not as young as we look. I'm 49, he's 50. - I'm 50. - So my check is like maybe seven and change. And his check is like six and change. And to get a month of eating and paying bills, utilities or whatever. It goes real quick. And if you have a disability. We have the same thing. I'd rather not say. Uh, y'know, I mean... Everything I do, see I have my little handicap pass. Actually, this is his. That's mine. - Because we both, in Atlanta, Georgia we both worked for UPS. Our job was, we were loading planes. But it got to a point where it was starting to affect our health, so we couldn't work anymore. So we had to rely on social security disability. But yet and still, it's not enough to make ends meet. - My name is David. And I have a different approach than he does. I do try to make money with the cans and everything. But what I like most of all is, I call it treasure hunting. Y'know, because I find all kinds of, you'd be surprised what people throw out. I must have like about five stereos at home, two computers. And they don't throw away stuff that don't work. They throw away stuff, because they want to upgrade. So I mean, nine out of 10, if I find three computers, two of them are gonna work. Now this right here, chances are. I look at it, it's in good condition. Chances are it works. Oh, yeah. Also, we find a lot of books, a lot of books. And thank God for the Strand Bookstore. We take them downtown and sometime I get as much as 40, $50. One man's trash- - Is another man's treasure, and it's true. Because I actually furnished my first apartment, over on York Avenue where Gracie Mansions at. Furniture was kind of easy because by me recycling, I come across things that's in good condition, like this. This is a clothes dryer. Sometime people that have a abundance of things, they will order things from magazines, or stores or whatever. They get it delivered by UPS. And when it comes, they look at it. They don't like the color. And they throw it away with tags and everything. So I was like, one of the best dressed homeless person you ever want to see. - We both lived in Atlanta. He's actually from Louisiana. - We fleed Katrina. - Yeah, we were Katrina victims. - We were Katrina victims. - Yeah, I lost everything. I was a student. I went to SUNO, Southern University. My major was psychology. And I had been going to school already for like two years. I had started going to school in New York. And... I don't know, for whatever reason I wanted a change of pace. So I moved to Louisiana, and that's where we met. After about a year, you know, Katrina hit. And luckily we got out before it actually struck. I had just got my student loan, and I had rented a car so we can hang out on the weekends. And then I took my computer and different things, some clothes or whatever. And I think I had a dog then. - Yeah. - And we left, thinking that okay, after three days or so we can come back. But of course the rest is history. And you know that we weren't able to go back. I lost everything. - I left my husband, and I took to the streets. Y'know. it's a long story why I left or whatever. And I was homeless. I found myself over in Central Park. I was on 57th Street and Fifth Avenue. I stayed hungry because I wasn't used to being on the streets. I had no idea about soup kitchens or anything. I didn't know. But after four days of not eating, and being so hungry where you can't cry. Your tears, you have no more tears. And you're so hungry, you figure out things. The restaurant, they would put the food that they had to throw out. They would put in clean containers, and they would offer it to us. One person would go by Dunkin' Donuts. One person would go by Pizza Hut. One person would go by Chirping Chicken, you know, the chicken place. One person would go by the supermarket to get the vegetables and the fruit. And we would all bring in whatever that we collect. We would bring it in, and sit down and have a family dinner. It was 20 strangers, sitting there having dinner. And we would do this each night. And therefore the money that I was making from the cans, I was saving it and saving it. I walked around with my backpack, my belongings. And my money would be in my bag. I've seen families out here. The mother's pushing her cart, and then you see the little kids on the side digging in the garbage. I've seen people out here that I would have never thought that would be picking through people's garbage. Never complain. - There you go. It's getting hot out here. Na, nah, gimme one... Hey yo, do me a favor. You got plastic. I got a lady over here with plastic, alright. I need you to get on a line. - He got plastic. - No, no, no. I need you to get on a line. I'm the onsite maintenance personnel. I'm 26 years old. And when I started eight years ago, I was 18. 18, so I was kind of real young in the field, dealing amongst older, older gentlemen and women. You know what I mean? And you have to learn how to deal with the psychology of you know, groups of people. And just focus on what the task is. And that is, help making the world greener. - Oh man, my first week on this job. I think I told myself, what am I doing to myself? Lifting, my body wasn't conditioned for that. And doing that every day. - These guys don't have enough help. They need more help because, like with people standing in line, and machine's getting cleaned out, you know. It's always, people are always waiting. - The stereotype of people picking up bottles, and canning as they wanna say, was very unsanitary. You know what I mean? And, y'know, just people who lived on the streets. But actually, when I began to work here, I learned, I learned differently. You have people who have lives, who basically live in homes and pay bills. - If you was to see me walking down the street doing this, I would have a hood over my head, sunglasses because I don't want nobody seeing me. I'm embarrassed, this and that. I do it proudly now. I have no problem with it. And um, you know, It came to, - And like he says, a honest dollar. - It's an honest dollar. - And there were fewer people doing it back then. Now it's more or less acceptable. Now, I can't always say that about every neighborhood. I'm from uptown. I'm from what they call the hood. And up there, it's not really acceptable. People still see, they'd see you as a bum. And I hate to say it, but my own people. I'm recycling. The law says you gotta recycle. So what I'm doing? I'm obeying the law. Hey, what if I were some lunatic, with a knife or gun, or some kind of weapon or something taking your money? How would you feel then? - I just want humanity. When I meet people, that's all I expect out of them is humanity. I'm David Durrah. I've been doing cans ever since 1990. Maybe 1995. And it's been like a supplement income for me. It helps with what I got coming in. A lot of people feel like a guy with my education, and all that kind of stuff, have to feel some kind of a feeling of shame. You know, but I don't. This is just making money, just like anything else. Like this Thursday is my last day at the club I play at. Yes, I'll be working on a cruise line. - If you coming to do a dirty job, you're not gonna come in a three-piece suit. You know what I mean? You know, seven days. - People look at me like, "Ew, you're putting your hands in there?" You use gloves. No, I don't use gloves because I do certain buildings where I know I don't need the gloves. But constantly, I carry hand sanitizer. I wash my hands constantly. So I'm okay. Nobody would know you're homeless, because you're clean. See, I used to always be clean. I used to go inside the restaurant by the zoo. I used to go, wake up in the morning, wash my face. And they have security. So I wasn't really afraid of being out there. They tried to take her stuff. She had her eye swollen. People are talking, Yeah. Look. Basil. - My kid's mom, she passed. And I started just saying, ah the hell with it. But her heart messed up on her. She was 30. We had such a good time. As far as we were concerned, our boys is the most important thing in our life. But they're good boys. My baby is 31. The other one is 33. - I have a son that's 28. My daughter, yeah. I have a daughter that just turned. She just turned 17 the first of this month. And I have two grandkids. She's with her mother. Yes. She's cool. She's in they nice house in Jersey. Good, they living all right. She got remarried after the divorce. She got remarried and everything, so... I let it go. As of right now, I couldn't really tell you what my son is doing. 'Cause I haven't seen my son in, I haven't seen my son in about, maybe say 11 years. - She's gone. A lot. A whole lot. - Well, my son died at 30. - Really? - Yeah. He had asthma. And my daughter lives in Florida. My granddaughter is gonna get married. They bought me a nice dress, 200 dollars. Yeah. My daughter, she's going to school to be a physical therapist. So when I put 25 bottles in the bag, it's pretty good. But if I put 48 or 50, it's too much. My lungs and my heart keeps flooding with water because I'm trying to, I'm not eating the right things. And then when I don't eat the right thing, and I'm lifting, it's too much on my heart. So basically what I do now, I send her 50, 60 dollars a week every week. Or either I'll wait and send once a month, I'll send her like 200 dollars. And all of that money comes from the cans. He started when he was about 14. He wanted these expensive things that I couldn't afford to buy him. So I showed him how I get my money. I say you want this? He said I'm too young to get a job. I said, okay, but you can go to work with me. Come on, I'm gonna show you what I do to buy you those sneakers, to buy your school supplies and things like that. And I got him out here and it took him awhile. He didn't want to do it, and it was too hard. It's tiring. But then once he got his own bag of cans, and took it and cashed in, and kept his own money. Then he's like wow, this is good. And he did it for the next two summers, he did. You know? - I mean, you figure one can is five cents. So I have to get 20 cans just to make a dollar, 100 cans to make five dollars. - The thing about it is, picking up is the easiest part. It's not easy at all, but that's the easiest part is to collect them. Come on. You be like, Good morning. You can imagine how we work. But of course they couldn't bear us in Manhattan. And everything were plastics and glass. And I mean, it could not be. So we were asked, after two months we were asked to leave the facility. We went to a better place. Now we are very open. But we hope we will stay here longer, hopefully. I will just... That's good. - A different company. No, different. - Certainly, I am not here because I love counting bags, or counting, or loading trucks. So, the only reason just really that I get involved to this kind of projects is because I like people. Not because I like whether they get five cents more or five cents less. - I used to make a lot of money. I mean, I used to make incredible money. And back then I also had a car. So, I was stuffing stuff in my trunk. I was padding up my back seat. Actually, I had a Cadillac. And people would be wondering. What's this guy with a Cadillac doing with bottles in the back of his car? But I was making money. And people would be wondering. What's this guy with a Cadillac doing with bottles in the back of his car? But I was making money. Now I make 15, about 10, 15 dollars every day. And I put my numbers, my lotto numbers in with it. 'Cause my car won't hold that much. If I have it loaded, it holds about 40. Today I'll probably make maybe 40, anywhere from 30 to 50, 50 dollars. - I see an average of about 80 dollars, to about 120 dollars a day for some people here. - This is a good thing for me, 'cause I like good things. I like cell phones. I like watches. I like good shoes. This pays for all this that I wear. - It pays for the cell phone. It pays life insurance, which I didn't have, even when I was working. I didn't have life insurance. Now I have life insurance. I pay for cell phone bills. Basically, you know, whatever I need is taken care of through cans. - Well, I hope to get a really good job. That's what I'm hoping for. It's simple, I know how to go. You go into the department store, fill out the application. But now they want you to go online. I'm not too keen about going online. You understand? Just give me pad and paper, let me fill it out. And whatever tests you take, and that's it. But all that going online because I won't get no feedback. The reason why I won't get no feedback, because I don't have a computer, nor a laptop to get any feedback too. At least I know I can fill the application out and say, well, hey. You got the job, you hired or whatever. - I would like to either be a substance abuse counselor, or work with people living with AIDS. Actually, I only have like 13 credits to go, believe it or not. It's just I'm getting older, and I've got kind of lazy. And I got kind of sidetracked 'cause of Katrina. 'Cause I was going to Southern University. So eventually I will go back, and I'll get those last 15 credits. Um, I know I can do it. I can do anything I put my mind to. - I would like to be a counselor. I'm working on that now. I figure this way, I have enough in my life going on that I can help somebody with it. I think it's okay to have a person that you can talk to, y'know, and not be afraid or ashamed, a person that you can say anything you want to, to. And know they're not gonna judge you, good or bad. Well, I have to finish two more tests, and I'll get my certificate in counseling from Stratford Career Institute. I'll finish the two tests within the next week. And I'll mail them in. And then from there, I'm gonna try to get funding for higher training. If not, I'll pay it for myself. I don't care. I prefer to have funding, because I really can't afford to spend that kind of money. - 'Cause God is gonna take care of me. God takes care of me. Yep. - This is my card right here. And if you go online, you will see my trio, and you'll see all the records that I've done. Yeah, and I do classes. I teach the kids around the neighborhood. I do it to them for free. I teach the kids that want to learn for free in my neighborhood, over on 129th Street. My apartment, their parents bring them over. But I'm working on a cruise line starting Friday. And we'll be sailing to Alaska for a month. I've been through the canal a lot of times. A lot of times. If you know how to survive in New York, you can survive anywhere, anywhere. - God bless you. - They are my family. And I love that they're from different nationalities, different races. And that gives me a lot of joy, to have such a big family, and such a diversity of friends and companions in life. They are the most important people in my life. I don't have husband. I don't have children. So my whole life is for them. Working. No no. Working for to make. - Right about now my stomach's hungry, and I'm going home to eat, to a friend of mine's. Y'all take care now.
