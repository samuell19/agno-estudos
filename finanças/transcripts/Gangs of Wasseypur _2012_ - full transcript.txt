May I leave now? Good bye! - Bye. Definite, come here. Come inside. He just left...! Fill up the tank. Let's go... Hey, Faizal... Someone just shot your father. Someone shot your dad. Danish... wait, son. Get inside, mom! - I want to come. You should stay home. Nothing will happen to dad. Shama, take her inside. [Nagma:] Let me go with you, son. Were'nt you supposed to be with dad, fucker? I fell asleep. - 'Fell asleep? Fell asleep?' Asshole! You're always lying stoned on Fazlu's terrace. Like you're always lying on top of sis-in-law in the bedroom. Enough! [Nagma:] Hurry up! [Eye witness:] We were having tea... ...when Mr. Sardar Khan's car drove in. We recognized him as he comes here often. Suddenly there was loud firing and a few guys on motorcycles... Father!! [Danish:] Who killed him? Who the fuck killed my father? Sir, they have arrested one of the shooters. Get out, motherfucker! Get out...! Look, you can't... - Stay back. 1 said stand back! [Asgar:] Rip the fucker a new hole! Speak, bastard! Speak. He just left...! Hey, Faizal... ...lets take father's body home. But... we're in the midst of an investigation... Shut the fuck up! This is my father's corpse, and it will go straight home. So fuck your investigation. Understood? Come on, lift him... Wonderful news, Mr. Singh! Our officers can finally breathe easy after 12 years. Not for long, I'm afraid. Sardar Khan's gone, but he's left behind 4 sons. Five. - Sorry? Five. Four from the first wife, and one from the second. The second one's a cook at my place. Meet Sardar Khan's fifth. What's your name? Definite. - Why 'Definite'? Because I have a definite mission in life. Which is? Sardar Khan's death. But he's already dead. How many rotis are ready? - About 8. [Shama:] Hurry up... they're waiting. I'll serve some curry till then. How can you all eat? Even 1 belong to brother Sultan's family. You are now my family. And my parents? They are my parents too. But what about what your mom just said? You're just pissed that someone else bumped off your old man, not you. [Fazlu's mom:] Brother Saggir's call for you... Yes, coming mom... Go to hell, loser! [Danish:] You have to stay alert all the time. Fazlu doped you with weed and informed Sultan that dad was riding alone. Sultan was there himself, with Saggir and another guy. And like a dumb-ass you kept hanging with your 'buddy'! Wanna play with a two-face, better learn to carry a mask. [Fazlu:] Tomorrow morning, at the shopping centre. [Danish:] Let me know if you can't do this, Faizal. Sit. He's not here. But Faizal had said he'd be here by 11am. What time is it? Come on... let's leave, son. Now what are you doing? [Nagma:] Stay away from long haired girls at school. Look at this fat lice. Go to your room, boys. Where is Shama? May 1 ask something? - Yes. Can't you leave this blood shed and look after the family? Begging for your brother's life, eh? No... yours. Look here Shama Parveen, don't you ever interfere in my work. Understood? DHANBAD POLICE STATION 1 surrender... for stealing wood. Easy there, buddy! [Fazlu:] There are cops here. [Sutan:] Fuck them. Yes, 1 was angry and had threatened to kill him... ...but 1 wasn't even at the shopping centre that morning. [Lawyer:] Why did you surrender then? 1 had stopped and unloaded wood from a train. When 1 learnt that it's illegal 1 decided 10 surrender myself. [Judge:] Do you have any other witnesses? [Lawyer:] No, your honour. [Judge:] You are released with a fine of Rs.500. Non-payment will lead to... ...15 days imprisonment. Run... run, motherfuckers! [Old Bollywood song:] Such kindness... Such compassion... Such kindness... Such compassion... It will take me many years... It will take me many lifetimes to repay you. Guddu Love has a very high price to pay. But whenever they speak of love or fidelity... Love has a very high price to pay. But whenever they speak of love or fidelity... ...the world will take our names... ...the world will only tell our stories. Such kindness... Such compassion... It will take me many years... It will take me many lifetimes to repay you. [Nagma:] He's completely incapable. Drugs have made him useless. The pain of losing one so young... ...and Danish was my first-born. Calm down... 1 understand your... Faizal... ...when will your blood boil, son? Your father paid for your drugs with his life. Now your brother has paid the price for your recklessness. So when will you pull the trigger, boy? When will you leave those potheads and avenge your father and brother? Look at your eyes... dead with drugs. [Nasir:] Enough, Nagma... If those filthy hands can only eat, then let me feed you, fucker! Now what are you staring at? [Nagma:] Where's that knife? [Nasir:] Stop it. Have you lost it? Here... let me chop those useless fingers. Enough, mother. - I'll chop them. This is madness, Nagma! Shut up! You will stay out of this. Father, grandfather, brother... your son Faizal will avenge them all. Don't cry, my old lady. Your old lady can't see her young ones dying before her. Staying stoned won't help you forget Danish's death. Who wants to forget, uncle? It's been a month since we buried him. 1 know that. Then what are you doing about it? Same as you... ...counting days! [Rally speaker:] Long live, Fazlu Ahmed! [Rally speaker:] Fazlu Ahmed... [Rally speaker:] Long live Wasseypur's new youth leader! Where are you going? Fazlu has won the election today. Take Asgar with you. He's my friend. 1 will congratulate him myself. [Nagma:] Eat something, dear. How long are you going to blame yourself? Long live brother Fazlu! - Shut up, cunt. [Faizal:] Fazlu... Hey, Faizal... ...my buddy's here. Get out of the way. Where've you been, buddy? We're partying "cos 1 won, man... where have you been? [Faizal:] Everyone spits at me at home. And people laugh at me outside... the bastards. Why? Because the cunts feel that... ...Faizal sacrificed his own blood for friendship. My old woman says if 1 wasn't born, there'd be no mourning in Sardar Khan's home. What do you mean? 1 mean... here, light the toke first. This is really strong, dude. What's with the stare, man? I used to think I'm the angry, young Hero born in the villian's den... ...but 1 turned out to be just a silent side-kick. Someone else turned out to be the Hero. Who? I'm coming...! ...she plays with rocks. She flips and flops...' '...is made of dew drops. And makes only holy stops! [Nasir:] Fazlu's death made Faizal a force to reckon with. People were terrified of him after the ruthless beheading. All illegal iron traders were also scared and soon became his cronies. Not an ounce of iron could be cut or sold without Faizal's consent. Even the cops were in on it. Every police station was on his pay roll... ...and they happily turned a blind eye to his illegal affairs. His business finally became stable when he set up a massive iron warehouse. [Popular Bollywood song:] Take me... Make me yours. It is time... ...make love to me. Let me wear your body... ...while you sprinkle your honey love on me! Isn't this song a little... naughty? Like you. Huh? 1 want your... permission for something. What? You won't mind, right? Nope. 1 want to have sex with you. Do you want to eat my shoe first...? That's it. Get out. Get out! - But you said you won't mind. Yeah, right! Get out now. I'll wake up everyone with one scream. 'Lover gets the Bride'. - Seen it 4 times. "Who Am 1 To You?' - That film's gone. 'Bollywood Dreams'? - Seen it. 'Karan Arjun'? Come on... let's see that film. It's got Shahrukh and Salman as Heros. No, you'll hold my hand. 1 won't. - You will. 1 swear on my mom, 1 won't. And you won't press my cheeks? 1 swear on mom, 1 won't. And you won't grope my lap to 'look for popcorn'? 1 swear on mom, 1 won't. - You won't? Will you stick to me? - 1 swear on mom, 1 won't. Why don't you just watch it with your mom then, loser. Give me a pencil too. Don't go alone. What if you're attacked from behind? Listen, old woman... ...in this line of work one can't trust 2 things. One, the fear born from your own heart. And second... partnership! Death is certain. If Allah doesn't kill me, this neighbourhood will. God forbid! Fazlu left me fatherless... ...when 1 trusted him more than myself. So what's the point! [Arms dealer:] This button unloads the entire magazine. Guddu:) 1 want 15 of these. [Guddu:] And 12 of this. [Arms dealer:] Is that all? [Guddu:] Boss wants only this many. What's that? [Arms dealer:] Pager. What does it do? You send messages through it. You tell them your message and they send it for you. Message to whom? To whoever you have work with. But who sends it? Whoever has work. Yeah, but who sends it? Anyone can... your family or your friends. So very dark... My lover is so dark... His skin is dark... but his heart is darker. Dark abuses fall from his black tongue... Grey days become dark evenings... For my lover is a coal criminal. So very dark... My lover is so dark. Dark skin... with a darker heart. And black cusses fall from his black tongue. Grey days become dark evenings... For my lover is a coal criminal. He will find the damn coal... ...and steal the damn coal. He will find the damn coal, and steal the damn coal. He won't stoke the kitchen fires... But he sure knows how to steal that coal. My lover is a wicked, wicked thief. The soil is dark, the dog is blacker. Black as the kohl in my eyes. He's black as a raven... ...he's darker than fear. [Gang member:] Merely holding a gun doesn't make you a Don. Killing Sultan and Ramadhir Singh is no child's play. To do that you need guts. And how many has Faizal killled anyway? Just Fazlu... ...that too by conning him with friendship. For now people seem afraid, but that fear will soon evaporate. What say, brother... Am 1 wrong? Check this out. Brother, any clue what day of the week it is today? Such a wicked thief. Such a wicked, wicked thief. Such a crazy coal thief. Dark as sin... ...that's my lover. [Faizal:] I've sworn on my mother... ...that I'll lay your corpse at her feet. Why on earth? Because you killed my father. See, if 1 hadn't killed your father he would've killed me. But you also killed his father. True. He wanted to kill me too. See, that's how the story began. Look, Faizal... ...1 have nothing against you, your father or your brother. I killled them so I could live. Tell me, who wants to die needlessly? So what do you want? 1 won't come in your way. You rule Wasseypur. Do as you please. Make your millions. Dhanbad authorities will back you. And if my men flout this agreement, feel free to shoot me. But if you slip up... ...then 1 will act appropriately. You shouldn't mind then. So your dad's merrily joined hands with them... ...and expects us to get amnesia. That bastard chopped up Fazlu and we should forget it? But you killed his brother and father... didn't you? Now father has decided that no one will touch Faizal. What if he attacks us? Then handle it... but don't involve us. Black clouds loom, there will be black rain. His black flags rebel... against the dark winds. But the money in his black purse is as guilty as his eyes. The inglorious smoke from his black flames... The black sun rules with its iron heat. The lamp, the elephant, and all... is black... pitch black. God damn that coal... ...he will steal the damn coal. If there is coal, he will find it and steal it... ...for that's all his black heart gives a shit about. He's the thief of my heart. Have you crapped as well? Where's Khalid? [Nasir:] Khalid was Sultan's main henchman. And the only one of Sardar's killers whose whereabouts were unknown. How much does he pay you? Dried bones and bread. If you join me you'll get a whole goat every month. Now where do 1 shoot you... in the ass...? In the intestines...? Or... ...shall I let you go? - Let me go. What? - Let me go. Okay, then. From now you'll shadow Khalid for me. And if you try to decieve me I'll bury you wherever you're standing. See, 1 smoke pot, hash... ...I've even murdered Fazlu and a few others. Done some jail time too. So you want to tell me about your stuff? [FAIZAL] Like a wire... As thin as a wire... My darling's as thin as a wire... What in God's name have you done to him, ma-in-law?t My darling's shrunken like a dried prune...t He's like a dried prune...T Poor darling... my poor dear. Just doesn't eat...T My darling doesn't eat a thing...t What in God's name have you done to him, ma-in-law?t My darling's as thin as a wire... My darling walks in dark caves... My darling walks in dark caves... His life's a dark mine, swiftly filling with water... Where have you led the poor workers, our leader? Where have you led the people, great leader? Was this the Worker's movement, dear leader? Was this the flame you lit, people's leader? At the rate of coal... Sold at the rate of coal... Sold at the rate of coal, everyday my dear. My darling, my dear... My Bihar! Fountains of lament burst through mountains of sadness... Fountains of lament, my dear... My darling is as thin as a wire.t [Priest:] ...with a deposit of Rs.11,021... ...and these people as your witness, do you take Mohsina as your wife? 1 do. Do you grant Faizal Khan permission to marry you? 1 permit him. Say, '1 do'. 1 do! Congratulations, dear! What broke? Either sleep or lay the mattress on the floor. Some guy's here with news of Khalid. [Faizal:] Where's my gun? [Mohsina:] In your pants! [Faizal:] Shut up! [Mohsina:] But where are you going? [Nagma:] ...so wash colored and whites separately... ...but only if they're cotton. Georgettes can be mixed. Salaam, mother! [Nagma:] Ironing marks are visible here. And does this look white to you? [Nagma:] Faizal? Our enemy is standing in our porch... ...this doesn't seem right to me. Please take care of the house, my mother... ...and let me handle the business. But he's a close aide of Khalid's. He used to be... now he's my aide. Now please look after the house. Where's Khalid? He's eating breakfast alone at the crossing. His family is on a pilgrimage, so he eats out often. No one will follow me. But if 1 don't return, kill him. Come on, step out. Everyone out. Come on... What's up, asshole! Forgive me, brother. - Shave his head. Hey, wait! I'll get you Sultan. 1 can get him myself, asshole. We're both Muslims, brother. Even Allah forgives once... - Move that razor, man. Wear these. Please forgive me... - Wear these. Check out Dr. Evil! He shaved and shot him, and we should twiddle our thumbs? What? Just talk to your dad, dammit! [Ramadhir:] It's a tender for a new highway... ...from the city of Patna to Kolkatta, over the river Ganges. Father. Sultan had called. Go and arrange tea and snacks. What is this? Musical chairs? Get out. Get out! Father... I've told you many times... don't name thugs in polite company. Thing is that Faizal has just shot the guy who killed Sardar Khan. So what's the problem? But he was our man. - He was Sultan's. And Sultan is not our man either. But isn't he working for... - Silence... ...and shove your sentiments in your arse. Stop playing silly games with petty politicians here... ...why don't you go to your constituency and motivate people instead? And where were you last night? - I was watching a movie. Which movie? 'The Lover Gets The Bride.' Son... you're not up to this. You're worrying me now. I don't think this job is for you. Give him the goat... ...and let him go. [Nasir:] Babu Khan a.k.a Babua a.k.a Perpendicular! The youngest brother, merely 14... but crime was child's play for him. See this blade? Nothing will happen if you use it sideways. So always hold it like this and use it perpendicularly. Do you know 'perpendicular'? - Yup. What? Like this iron slab, I'm perpendicular to it. A dead body means the blade must have cut it perpendicularly. But a mere slit in the skin means it was a tangential cut. Here. Practice and report. [Nasir:] Perpendicular was more terrifying than Faizal. A 14 year old who literally played with a blade in his mouth. Who simply knew: Blade + skin = blood! 1 hit perpendicular, he hit at a tangent. He had many run-ins with cops, but always escaped. Bullets were whizzing past me... ...one even grazed my ear... ...ka-pow!! But they couldn't catch me! It was impossible to get evidence or a witness against Faizal's brother. It wasn't him. And he always got away scott free. His best friend was Tangent. Tangent did everything with Perpendicular... ...but was the first to flee in the face of danger. Hi, I'm Perpendicular. Faizal Khan is my elder bro. I've come to rob your shop. So please don't call the cops, or we'll shoot you. Are you done, uncle? Go on then. Open everything. We should mask up now, or they'll identify us. Here... give me the keys. Open it... quickly! [Perpendicular:] Those are my slippers. Hide this in my room. Ciao! Perpendicular got caught again. And the jeweller said... It wasn't him. Perpendicular was released. Hey, Babua...! [Perpendicular:] What now? Come here. What's this 1 hear? 1 think you accidentally took my keys with the other stuff. If I could get the keys back please... [Nagma:] What were you shopping for? He's just a kid. Mistakes happen. [Nagma:] So beautiful. [Mohsina:] Isn't it? [Nagma:] Please send the receipt to Faizal's office. Babua... Babua... Hello! What's up, buddy! What's up? Wanna make 5 grand? [Nasir:] A new era of change had rung in. There wasn't just one Ramadhir Singh or Sardar Khan anymore... ...now any Tom, Dick or Harry wanted to be Sardar Khan or Sultan. Definite. His mother had handed him a pistol at a tender age. Where's the matchbox you stole from me? The world would be in flames by now if 1 really had it. Don't fight with anyone today. Every guy thought he was the studly Hero of his neighbourhood. But Definite also had the dual blood of Durga and Sardar Khan. [Film dialogue:] "They are just 'good friends'...!" "Can a young guy and girl be 'just friends'...?" "Here... another cliched 'friendship'...!" Definite and Perpendicular were from the same bloodline. While new thugs were mushrooming daily... ...Definite was the deadliest! [Film dialogue:] "A boy and girl can never be friends." "This is just to hide hot flames of desire inside throbbing hearts on those chilly nights.” [Girl:] But I'm your friend! 'A boy and girl can never be friends.' Isn't this that villian's dialogue? Yeah, so? While you're busy killing stray dogs and kittens... ...Faizal is gobbling up your father's wealth. 1 don't want a thing from that fucker. 1 just want Dhanbad! Which snake is this? It's a cobra! How do you hold it? Snake Cobra! Come to Papa! He's your brother after all. Always a problem kid. That Hindu woman killed last Ramzan was his handiwork. Apparently he loved her daughter. They would screw around anywhere... the terrace, the yard... When her mom found out she promptly sent the girl to her brother's in Calcutta. This made Definite threaten her, 'Call her back or I'll kill you!' Her mother threw him out of the house. He lost it and bashed her head in with a rod. How about making me a splendid 'paan', uncle! Make it with love or I'll put my friend in your pants. As you say, sir. Don't make me wait. Hey Definite, people are looking for you. Who's issued my warrant? - Brother Faizal, hurry. Give me that 'paan'... quick. Do you know what this 'warrant' means? My time has begun. Salaam, uncle! Salaam, brother! Do that again. Salaam-wallekum! [Faizal:] No, do that again. Salaam-wallekum! [Faizal:] Do the muffler move again. Oh, this! Is it dead? No, it's alive... [Faizal:] Why did you steal it? Just like that. It looked sexy. Sexy? [Definite:] Yeah. Return it. Brother, even 1 wanted to talk to you... - Later! This shit shouldn't happen again. Lets go, Mohsina. So what do 1 have to do? It's 10 feet... I've measured it. So you can actually fly the bike across? You think I've randomly come up with the bet? Have you done it before? - Many times. If I crush a goat, I'll eat it. You can shove the hooves up your ass too. First decide who goes first. Let's toss a coin. Choose. - Heads. 1 win. Hey, it's my coin. You go first. But 1 have another condition. You can't copy my technique. - Yeah, whatever. "Technique'! - I'll show you, Bugs Bunny. [Perpendicular:] Sister fucker! [Perpendicular:] What's he doing? [Perpendicular:] What's he up to? [Definite's friend:] He's an expert at this. He'll go over the planks at a speed of 80, and fly across the hill. [Definite's Friend:] Do you have a game plan? [Perpendicular:] Wait... What? - 1 won the toss, right? Yes. I've changed my mind. I'll go first. That's not cool, man! Whatever Perpendicular does is cool. You're openly cheating because you're Faizal's brother. Why drag brother into this? Give me the keys. Come on! Take it, asshole. Leave the money. What a fucking beggar! Hold this. Which key is it? [Perpendicular:] Motherfucking asshole! Sister fucker tricked me. I'll kick your ass. That's not nice, brother... - Love being a wise ass, don't you? I respect you a lot 'cos you're my brother and you're fearless! But you should also respect me, 'cos I'm not even afraid of you! Sit. [Nasir:] And thus began Definite's story. He always wanted to be the Don. Meanwhile, a new state had been formed out of Bihar... Jharkhand. And all the mineral rich land including Dhanbad became a part of this new state. Now every greedy officer and criminal got a chance to rape the region. Jharkhand was being robbed in broad daylight by all. Faizal's notoreity gave birth to many small time criminals. Most significant amongst them was Shamshad Aalam. He used to be a cloth trader... ...who then got into transportation and acquired many trucks. When he lost interest in that he decided to get into iron. We'll get into iron trade. [Shamshad's aide:] You can't unless you share profits with Faizal. Fuck that! 1 hear one can't even steal without his blessings. So now? He has one weakness... Money! He's all guts but has zero business sense. The fucker sells to anyone at any price. He sells stock worth 5 bucks at 2 bucks. If we fix the market price with him, he won't be able to resist a fat profit. The guys you sell to aren't even traders, they're middlemen. They buy from you at 2 bucks and sell at 4. You're being ripped off. Seriously! Bengalis don't care for iron anyway. The communist government over there doesn't care about industry. Lets sell the iron to Gujarat and Orissa directly and at higher rates. There's massive demand over there, and you have ample supply. What say? Even my transportation is sorted. 1 swear your meagre 2 bucks will turn into 3.5 with me. Salaam, sister! And I'll keep what's left. What say?? [Shamshad:] ...honorable Dep. Chairman of our Youth society. And the honorable Chairman, Mr.Faizal Khan. Please put your hands together for him. And the chairperson of the Ladies wing, Ms. Mohsina Khan. After making Faizal the Chairman of a 2 day old society... ...Shamshad jump-started his career. Faizal handed over his father's warehouse to him... ...and soon word spread that Shamshad was Faizal's man. This used to be my father's. It's been lying idle since brother passed away. This promptly became a hot-bed for money and debauchery. Why do you call mom 'old lady'? Its not as if you look 30. I'd say you look like siblings. Don't talk shit. - It's a fact. Have you seen your dark circles? All thanks to weed. Do you think you look 247? Hey, don't get irritated. I'm just saying that both of you look 40. - Call back later! Let's go. Why'd you marry me if I look like such a fossil? Don't get angry, I'm just stating facts. Brother, can you guess his age? I'd say... 40. What? How old am I...7? 35. - Are you sure? 24, 1 am born today, asshole!! Happy Birthday, sir! [Nagma:] Babua, come here... What is it? Go get this stuff from the market. Mother, tea is also over. - It's on the list. Quick! Hide the expensive stuff, Perpendicular's coming. Pack everything on the list. Quickly! This one's out of stock, can 1 give you another washing powder? How's it out of stock? It just is...! Then give me the cash, I'll buy it elsewhere. So he took your money and my stock, and left without paying. That's nothing! These cheeky school brats broke into my shop at night. Not only did they eat up all the sweets, they woke me up and made me fry them more! When I told Faizal Khan about it, he just laughed and said... ...He's just a kid' and handed me a measly100 bucks! That pint-sized devil's made our ilfe hell. This time my hands are tied. - Just quote your price, man. Look, if 1 get caught, the authorities won't help me. We'll tell you the time and place, the authorities will not know shit. And what about him... Faizal? Hey, 1 thought you weren't afraid of him?! Do what you have to. I'll handle my end. Don't worry! [Iron dealer:] How can I sell at 10 when the stock is worth 15? Atleast pay me my cost price of 14, then it's yours. You just won't learn! - Who you calling? Who you calling? I'll have to check with brother Faizal, won't I! Don't over react, sir... - My phone... Please listen... What? How about you make me an offer. - There he goes again! The boss has quoted 10, not me. Talk to him if you like. Give me my phone, man. - No way!! Return... my... damn... phone. Give it to me! - No!! Ok, give me yours. We have another one, see! [Shamshad's aide:] Faizal could shoot us if he's in a bad mood. Stop, in heaven's name, please! Fine! This is now between boss and this guy's family! Please don't get upset! [Faizal:] Are you sure? [Guddu:] The dealer's told everyone that his stock worth 15, you have bought for 10. Poor guy's shop is up for auction. [Faizal:] Hey, Baby-Talk... [Faizal:] Where you going? To study. [Faizal:] Right, the family scholar! [Faizal:] Just milk cows and you'll become the Chief Minister. What's up, asshole? [Shamshad:] All good, boss. Got a good rate from a dealer. Stuff worth 20, sold for 75. So has this dealer gone bonkers? [Shamshad:] Why? He's saying that his stock was worth 15. Really? [Faizal:] And you bought it at 10? Who did he say this to? He's standing right here. And you believe this, brother Faizal? [Shamshad:] Brother Faizal... Why the fuck are you sounding like Celine Dion now? Someone's poisoning your ears, boss. My ears are so full of wax, that nothing can enter. No discussion! Faizal:]I 1 don't care about the rates. You say 75, 1 believe you. The dealer says 10, 1 believe him too. 10 less from 75 is 65. So on delivery, 1 better have 65 in my hands. [Popular Bollywood song:] "My smile is my style..."” "My smile has a knack to make hearts crack...!" "Ooh! What's your name?" "Don't you know my name, baby?" "I'm Munna, the dude with a degree!” Do I look nice? - Oh, yeah! [Inspector:] I'll never leave this town. [Inspector:] I'm practically a tourist attraction here. [Inspector:] Inspectors here make millions! [Inspector:] I say let your kids become Inspectors too. [Inspector:] See, no matter who you are, you have to come here... like these two. How're you, sir? - Hello! How can we work peacefully if we get extortion threats? [Inspector:] What happened? Know what people call cops? - What? [Shamshad:] Ball-strokers of Faizal Khan! Really? You find it funny? [Inspector:] See, this complain will become a formal report. But our investigation will be futile without any evidence. [Inspector:] Get my point? He's inside. The film gets over in 10 minutes. Okay, get in. [Shamshad:] Tell Guddu that I'm back from the deliveries. Just do as 1 say. He'll call back in 15 minutes. INSPECTOR SINGH "I'm Munna, the dude with a degree.” "How's it hangin', dude?" I'll be back tomorrow morning! Let me in or you'll go straight to heaven. Give him a 'Magic Hug', dude! Here you go! You're no longer Tangent. You're my side kick, 'Circuit"! And from now I'm 'Brother Munna'! [Perpendicular:] I'm going to Bombay to meet Brother Munna. 1 wanna come {00. What'll you do there? - Whatever you say. What'll you do after meeting the actor, dumb-ass? I'll touch his feet. Then? What do you mean? What'll you do after that, slow coach? I'll stare at him. - Till when? Till my eyes hurt. Then? [Tangent:] What do you mean? [Perpendicular:] What will you do after staring? [Tangent:] I'll close my eyes. [Perpendicular:] Then? What's the rush, motherfucker? Run, Tangent!! Go and tell brother that Sultan's trying to kill me. [Sultan:] Just fuck him up. Hey, get out of the bus. [Constable:] Why are you gasping so hard? [Constable:] Do you know him? [Constable:] Say something. It's Faizal! Hello? [Faizal:] Hey asshole, back from the deliveries? [Faizal:] Where's my money? What money? Have you gone mad? [Shamshad:] My deal, my work, so my profit. What's wrong with your voice? Is Ramadhir's cock stuck in your throat? Hey, mind your language. 1 say we finish him off tonight. No, something's fishy. He wasn't alone. He was on speaker phone. He's going to kill Perpendicular! Who the fuck will kill him? He's gonna kill him. - Who? Sultan. - Motherfucker! [Inspector Singh:] Sir, I've got concrete evidence against Faizal. [Inspector Singh:] I'm on my way to arrest him. [Inspector Singh:] But I don't have a warrant yet. [Inspector Singh:] Could you arrange it while I arrest him? [Inspector Singh:] Okay, Sir Minister. Wasn't that Faizal Khan's vehicle? - Stop! [Deputy Inspector:] It is. Turn around. Sultan... the motherfucker! What's up, brother? Brother Faizal! Please hold on... [Inspector Singh:] You need to come with me. [Faizal:] Why? This is my little bro's body... [Inspector Singh:] Yes sir, but... [Faizal:] Silence! He's been murdered. [Inspector Singh:] Then hand over the body to us, sir... [Inspector Singh:] ...I have a complain against you. [Inspector Singh:] Officer, take the body. 1 hope you've come alone... ...because the rest think I'm a fucking fool. On my way. Aching to see you, dear. Mohsina! Please sing my song. Why? 1 really need 10 hear it. Don't feel frustrated, my fool... Don't be nervous, my fool... Don't feel frustrated, my fool... Don't be nervous, my fool... Don't let anything upset your mood... anytime, my dear fool. Whatever's wrong, dear... Whatever's wrong, set it right, dear. Don't lose hope, and try to fight some more, dear. Don't lose hope, and try to fight some more, dear. Fight some more, my dear fool. [Tangent:] Brother Definite? [Definite:] Yeah? [Tangent:] Shamshad's thrilled after getting Faizal arrested. [Definite:] So let him gloat. [Tangent:] If we put him in his place Faizal will notice us. But boss is in jail himself. - But you're not. What do you mean? The boss's chair is vacant. Let's eliminate Shamshad before he tries to sit in it. The power will be indirectly Faizal's, but directly yours. Once the town accepts you, rest is up to you. Shamshad...! Shamshad...! Where is he? Where's Shamshad? Where's he? [Mother:] Don't kill me... Check that corner. - Shamshad. Where are you? - Find him. Where the fuck is your son? Check the terrace. Perfect time for this fucking gun to get jammed. Hey, Shamshad! - He's not upstairs. Look inside. He has to be somewhere. [Shamshad:] How did you get in without asking, bastard? Mother... You hurt my mom, motherfucker? You were saying? Why did you hurt my mom? Why my mother? - Keep talking, big mouth. Don't do it, man... [Shamshad:] Motherfucker... [Shamshad:] Son of a motherfucker! Come on. Catch that motherfucker! Fuck off, asshole! Catch that... motherfucker!! Hop on, man. Why run when we have a scooter? My fake leather shoes are smart and hide the tatters of my heart. They have the nerve to ask me if 1 like the fucking weather. Meet me in the next lane. They drop their goggles and run, them crooks...! Their game is up... their goose is cooked! When I give them my killer Dirtier Harry looks! They drop their goggles and run, them crooks...! Their game is up... their goose is cooked! And they run scared... here and there! But my heart is a messy affair! Control your cock, man. There he is. Wait for me... Where are you? He's at the gas station. Speak up. He's right in front of me... at the gas station. Which station? The new Bazaar one. And he's got a gun. The fucker's got no bullets in it. [Shamshad:] Just grab him. I'm on my way. All hail my Assholiness...! 1 lie with such silken finesse...! Beer bottles open with my teeth... ...and my eyes can make an iron rod weep. I've got brains and attitude to spare... ...1 play with risk without a care. While my enemies run... here and there. But my heart is screwed beyond compare. Fuck off, asshole. Hop on, dickface! [Ramadhir:] You should get into politics. [Ramadhir:] You see, Wasseypur is a jungle of Hyenas. [Ramadhir:] Over here brains won't get you far. Imagine, if Definite's gun had bullets... ...would you be having tea with us right now? You may have done this, but Faizal will suspect father. See, you trapped Faizal, and Sultan bumped off his brother. No sir, that was different... ...the Perpendicular case was different. Now it's in everyone's best interests... ...to finish him off while he's in there. [Shamshad:] Who, me? Definite! That fucker? Look, son... ...just as iron cuts iron... ...only a fucker can fuck with another fucker. But why will Definite kill Faizal? [Ramadhir:] Because he wants to become Faizal Khan! You know, I've been here for decades. 1 got Faizal's grandfather killed. 1 got Sardar killed. Then that... ...Danish. But I'm still alive. Why? Why? Because sir is the real Godfather! You tell me why? [J.P.Singh:] Why? Because 1 don't watch Bollywood movies. [Shamshad:] Really? In my youth, all my friends used to watch 'Ganga Jamuna'... ...and wanted to be Dilip Kumar. The girls were crazy about Dev Anand. Then came another phase. Women liked Rajesh Khanna. And guys liked that Amitabh Bachchan fellow. And these days they like that... ...he has a very nice name... - Salman Khan. And that... - Sunil and Nargis Dutt's son... Sanjay Dutt. Every fucker's got his own movie playing inside his head. Every fucker is trying to become the Hero of his own imaginary film. I swear, as long as there are fucking movies in this country... ...people will continue to be fooled. "1 won't recognize him by face..." "1 might not even know his name..." "...'cos my heart will recognize him instantly.” "The heart is crazy, it is unstoppable...” Inside you're safe because of Faizal, asshole. Outside I'll smash your arrogance with my AK-47, bastard. [Faizal:] Stop this shit. [Faizal:] Definite...! I'm not afraid of your stupid threats, fucker. My tiny country revolver is enough for you. Fuck off. Worthless piece of shit...! Shamshad's withdrawn the case against you. [Definite:] Why? Does he want me to marry his sis? [Faizal:] He's trying to make an alliance with you. Definite:) So what should 1 do? He's here. You chill here. Start the bike. Now why's he here? Hey, man. What's up! - How're you? Got the cash 1 sent you? That's how 1 bought 2 kilos of apples. You bought apples for 2 lacs? - But they're from Kashmir. The best terrorists eat them... want one? Sure... sit. Motherfucker! Shamshad...? Fuck that bastard's happiness! Hey, isn't this Faizal Khan's house? Something's not right, brother. - Quiet! Anyone home? Faizal Khan? He's in jail, brother. 1 know that. Brother...! Please come in. Would you like some tea? What happened to your arm? [Nasir:] Shama had gone into a coma. Faizal also mellowed down. Everyone's moves had back-fired. Shamshad was also fighting for his life. Ramadhir knew that Sultan had made a grave mistake. This was the first time that a woman had been shot in Wasseypur. By custom, she was Danish's widow first and then Sultan's sister. And no one knew this better than me. An eerie silence had descended, but 1 knew it carried a storm in its belly. Ramadhir and his son knew that Faizal's dignity had been hurt. They also knew that the town shared and supported his sentiment. Their one mistake had him so powerful... ...that it was important to end him before he realised this. Shamshad's gang had to leave town as no one wanted to join them. Faizal Khan was the new Don. [Popular Bollywood song:] "Hey, you... hey, buddy..." "Hey you, listen up, buddy... our Hero is here!" "He's the Pied Piper of our lives." "Even numbers dance to his tune!" "He is the stud... your best friend... the perfect gentelman!” Don't give Faizal a chance to stabilise. He's just been released from jail today. His family must be celebrating his return... ...know what I mean? Just a minute... Yes, father. No, I'm not planning a thing. I'm doing as you had asked, father. I'm lying really low. Goodbye, father! There's going to be a new sheriff in town. [Inspector:] Stay on high alert. 4 jeeps will do day-night surveillance. Don't be afraid. But keep your guns close. But don't make a move. Believe me, we won't be able to anyway. You can't, for sure. - No one can, sir. Get out! If you fly so high you might reach heaven! Now where's the Minister's number? Greetings, Mr. Minister, sir! It's me, Inspector Singh... ...Incharge of Dhanbad. Greetings! Thought I'd let you know that the new inspector is acting too big for his boots... What?! You've posted him here? What are you doing? My hands are tired thinking about you. Not now. - Why not? You're back after ages, everyone wants to meet you. But 1 only want to meet you. You're incorrigible! Sis-in-law is in hospital and you're... Don't drag her between us, she'll get stuck. Please... ...the show's about to start. What's the status on Ramadhir? And which hospital is Shamshad in? [Popular Indian soap theme music] Fuck off! Lower the volume. Just watch your show. [Nagma:] But what happened? 1 see Faizal Khan, Boss. - Then get in and kill the motherfucker. Get out, Faizal. Come outside, asshole. Fucker's locked it. Give me a bomb. Definite??? Uncle, where are you? In the office. Where are you? Stay put. Don't worry. They're just stray shots. Stay there till 1 tell you, uncle. Get the bombs, quick! Blow this shit up. Everybody get down! Faizal! You go ahead. I'll follow. Where are you, Definite? - On my way. Don't worry! I'll worry if I stay alive, bastard. Death is certain. If God doesn't kill me, this neighbourhood will. But I'll make these bastards pay. Just stay calm and don't make a move. But where are you going? I'll come with you, brother! - No, you won't. But where are you going? - Keep my phone with you. But don't pick it up if it rings! Shut the door and don't let anyone out. [Mohsma ] [Ringtone:] "That's right! The baddie is here!" [Ringtone:] "I am not the hero, I am the villain..." Don't feel frustrated, my fool... Don't be nervous, my fool... Don't feel frustrated, my fool... Don't be nervous, my fool... Don't let anything upset your mood... anytime, my dear fool. Whatever's wrong, dear... Whatever's wrong, set it right, dear. Don't lose hope, and try to fight some more, dear. Fight some more, my dear fool. Hey, Guddu! Are you okay, brother? Faizal...? Where did you get hurt? - Did you get shot at? Everyone get inside. Those motherfuckers...!! And where had you run off, asshole? I was just in the market... - Those motherfuckers...! If only I knew, I'd have killed him when he passed me by. Please get inside. Ladies, please get inside. Where are you going? - Shut the door! Be careful, son! Just get inside! Get the car... ...and 1 don't need you. You guys guard the house. Dont let a soul in. Faizal? Go home, uncle. It was that fucking Sultan! Just guard the house, uncle. [Sultan:] They're here for us! Bastards! The fucker's coming here! [Sultan:] Go back... Let's get out of here. Come on, hurry! Hold on... Some cops have come home. Why? They want to offer protection. Give me the phone. Who's the fucking officer? Put him on. [Faizal:] I don't need your protection. [Faizal:] Faizal can protect himself. [Inspector:] Look, this time you were lucky but... [Faizal:] Shut up and listen. [Faizal:] It's Ramadhir who needs your protection. So please bring an army 'cos 1 will riddle him with bullets. Do not let him stabilise! Just kill them all... family members, servants, the laundry guy, even pets! Hold on. What's this? - Scissor to cut his plaster. We'll be back soon. Now please don't get distracted, ladies! It's for my daughter-in-law... Do you have Pathani shirts? - Sure, we have several... Any other styles...? Brother, you're in Dhanbad... ...but the address you want is of Varanasi city. Varanasi! This is Dhanbad! This says Varanasi, man. You're in another city. Still don't get it? Tell you what... Run... Shut every shop. Shut the whole motherfucking city down. Son of a bitch murdered my mother in the middle of the street. [Guddu:] You fucking rat... Hey, Definite! This rat lives with the fucker who killed mom. 1 want Sultan, dead or alive. 1 know that bastard's behind this. Open up, bastards...! [Definite:] Where is Sultan? Where's Sultan? He doesn't live here anymore. He moved out the day his sister got married to Danish. BHAGALPUR JUNCTION Sultan goes to the mosque for his afternoon prayers. He parks outside the vegetable market but leaves his gun behind. So as soon as he enters the mosque, you empty his gun. After that he goes to the meat market. He then goes home via the bazaar. That's where we should catch him. Some bread and stew, please. Hello. [Informant:] Sultan was behind me. [Guddu:] He'll go to the meat market now. Stay with him, and stay on line. Yeah! Where are you? [Definite:] I'm at the bazaar. [Guddu:] He's headed towards you. So? Keep hitting the kick-shaft. - But then my scooter will start. So first remove the spark plug and then keep kicking. [Sultan:] Show me the ripe ones. [Sultan:] Put them in a polythene bag. What's the status? - He's buying fruits. Why the fuck isn't he buying meat? Which fruit is he buying? - Banana. Oh!! Then he's got the loosies. What else? 1 can't tell. Shall 1 go closer? - Let it be. Poor guy doesn't know we'll eat his fruits. Shall T ask him to get lychees? Shut up, asshole! It's not lychee season yet. What's up? [Guddu:] Fucker's buying bananas. For whose ass? Yours! Just keep kicking the shaft! I don't want to break it. I'll kick it once he's done shopping. Brother... he's moving. He's going into the vegetable market. Why's he going to the vegetable market? But I'm not going anywhere. I'm not talking to you. But why won't you talk to me, sir? Fucking Dumb and Dumber!! 1 was talking to Definite. So talk to one of us at a time. Hello? Bastard disconnected me. So what fruit do you get in a vegetable market? Custard apple? Isn't that sugar-apple? Well...some call it pumpkin. Yes? He's buying jackfruit. Jackfruit? - Yes, brother. Now why would he want to buy jackfruit?? [Informant:] I feel... he wants to pickle it. Can't one make a curry out of it? Sure. Mummy makes mean jackfruit balls! My granny used to fry finely chopped jackfruit and serve it with rice. Don't Brahmins consider it their 'meat'? What's up? I've been calling you for eons, you deaf fuck! But you asked me to speak to only one. So talk to me, fuckwit. I'm suffering in this heat... [Informant:] Sultan's moving. But this was your idea... There's an aquarium inside my fucking helmet. [Informant:] Sultan's in the car! Then chuck the helmet. Show that pretty face to the world... come on! He's right behind Definite. Shut up! [Guddu:] He's behind you. No, he's in front of me. [Nasir:] After Sultan's death Faizal had no threats in Wasseypur. Danish, his widow, Nagma, Asgar... Definite had avenged them all. To cement Definite's lethal reputation, Faizal asked him to surrender. Ramadhir was also watching this keenly. Ever since Definite was a child, Ramadhir had hoped to make him his weapon. But Definite was untamable. He had no masters. And Sultan's death had made him even more fierce. So Ramadhir used his trump card... Durga! [Ramadhir:] Who took care of you and your son after Sardar's death? I'd also given you my word that... ...Definite will get what is rightfully his. Don't worry! He'll take it himself. It's not easy. Definite's not only in jail... ...he's also accepted all of Faizal's crimes. Sometimes 1 feel like he is... ...not your son... ...as much as Sardar's. Ramadhir wanted to drive a wedge between Faizal and Definite. All he needed was Faizal's one weakness. And Ramadhir knew which one... Money... black money! Whatever the source or amount. Faizal had no business sense, people came to him only out of fear. Ramadhir took advantage of this. So he first shifted Definite to the state capital prison. Prison is in your blood, isn't it? Please leave. I'm fine... without you. 1 raised a killer, not a coward. [Faizal:] Shamshad's still in hospital, and Ramadhir is unarmed. [Nasir:] But he's in the capital where you can't touch him. [Faizal:] He has to return... someday. [Nasir:] They've shifted Definite to the capital prison. [Faizal:] Who told you that? [Nasir:] He had called. Why didn't he call me? - You don't pick up your calls. Get me the prison in-charge. Brother... someone's here to see you. Let him in. Hello! This is Faizal Khan. Why has Definite been shifted to the capital? Definite! I mean the name. What's the meaning of 'Definite'? Definite. What's his real name? - Definite. Yeah, but what's his real name? Definite's real name is Definite. Guddu, what is Definite's real name? It is Definite. What had dad named him before 'Definite'? You know, like Perpendicular's real name was Babua. I've always known him as Definite. So what's the meaning of the word 'Definite'? 'Definite' is... what is definite! - So What - is - Definite? See, 'Def' means deaf... And 'nite' means net! Definite is that which is certain. [Nasir:] Neither Faizal nor his gang spoke English. But Iglakh did. And Faizal liked that. However, Iglakh was Ramadhir's mole. He was going to make Faizal pots of money, and make him forget about Definite. [Iglakh:] Indian trains often get de-railed. Ever wondered where these trains go? The government auctions these trains but at rates that are 40 years old. Now an old compartment is valueless. But if one breaks it down to its components, its value multiplies. The tyres, springs and sheets sell seperately, and the rest can be melted down to make pipes. And that's how a whole train gets auctioned. From the Internet to any government commodity, it's all auctioned. Bidders come from all over the country for this... ...and it all takes place right here in Dhanbad. [Nasir:] But Iglakh also had a past. 20 years ago, his father had abducted and raped a Wasseypur girl. Sardar had forced him to divorce his first wife to marry this girl. Iglakh was Mohsin's son from the abandoned first wife. How can Iglakh be Ramadhir's guy? He's an educated city-slicker. Thing is, Iglakh was left fatherless because of your dad... ...while Ramadhir supported and educated him. And here is the result for the tender issued on... But Faizal had bought into Iglakh's vision. His ambition now included all of Dhanbad. And so he chose to overlook Iglakh's past. I've been sent by Faizal Khan. And from now we will run a syndicate here. All bids will go through Faizal Khan. And only he will approve who gets the tender. [Bidder:] What the hell? [Bidder:] This is hooliganism! Sit...!! Any other issues? - You can't bully us like this! You may now leave your quotations here and go. Iglakh first made Faizal a fearful figure amongst the traders. He then took control of the Auction Room. And before the next auctions Faizal himself bribed railway officials. [Iglakh:] All you need to do is tell them I'm your guy. The auction will be led by Iglakh. And his word will be the final one. And all of you will submit to him. Cool? You said 'submit' instead of 'stand by'. What is 'stand by'? - Total support. So what's 'submit'? - Total surrender. So 1 was right. To break this syndicate, the government started auctioning on the internet. So the bids became faceless and the bidders didn't fear the syndicate. The Auction's done. - When? The bastards did it on the internet. The auction is over, brother. Some guy from Gujarat got the tender. Well, guess where he'll have to come to collect the goods? Salaam! - What do you want? Move it! What the hell do you want? Sign here please. And thus things stayed in Faizal's control and he made pots of money. His power over the auctions and railways opened a goldmine of wealth. Eventually Faizal became blind with power and black money... ...just like Ramadhir had wanted. Definite was left rotting in jail. It's all about people's power! Everyone respects you here since you've opened a school. If you represent Wasseypur in these elections you will surely win. No one can touch you then. In fact, stand as an independent candidate and win. Then any party will want an alliance with you. Once that happens you can openly dictate! What if 1 contest against Ramadhir from Dhanbad, and not Wasseypur? Against me? Find out what his plans are. - Yes, father. Full of venom, 1 was raised by scorpions. Bite me if you dare. 1 swear by my honour, 1 will tear you apart. Like a snake without a tail, you will writhe in pain. You're the bastard child of honour... ...I swear by your whore mother... ...as 1 dare you to enter my court of evil. Now Ramadhir got Definite released from jail and sent JP to meet him. But JP's agenda was not so much Faizal as much as his own father. He knew that only one man could remove Ramadhir out of his way. Faizal Khan! How will you get him to do that? If you do as I say, it will all fall into place. And what do 1 get? You get Wasseypur! And you get? Your honour, 1 promise, will be plundered and left in smithereens. How can you speak of plundering my honour... ...when you're the one wearing a blooming skirt...! My bullets will rape every pore of your body, my friend. Ramadhir has promised me your land and Wasseypur if I kill you. He's given mom 10 lacs as advance. - What'd you do? 1 kept the advance. He's asked me to watch you 24 hours and report to him. So when's the D-day? On the Election day. Iglakh will kill you. I'm the back-up! I'm the Devil's son, raised in the laps of witches. I'm the keeper of graves, dogs are my supper. That's funny 'cos humans like you are just a snack for me. I'm the Serpent King, a vulture... I'm disease and filth. So what? I'm a cannibal... I don't even spare cattle feed. You don't scare me... I sold the deed I made with the Devil. Fuck your deed! 1 just sold the fucking Devil himself! Hallelujah! Faizal... What happened? Tell me... You know, 1 never wanted to gel into father's business. May 1 get some tea? In fact, 1 didn't want anything. How did all of this happen? It's okay! But you're also getting out of this trap now... aren't you? Not if 1 win these elections... ...cos then 1 will sink deeper. Father had a chance to not return to Wasseypur. But he came back... ...and everyone got caught in the quicksand. Enough... hey...! Ramadhir's story could have ended long back... ...with Shahid Khan. But that blood bath is still continuing! 1 don't want any part of this. Whatever's wrong... Set right whatever's wrong... Don't lose hope, and fight some more, my dear fool. 12 of the total 26 polling booths are strongly in our favour. The remaining 14 will be a worry and our main targets. The voting here will be against us and the booths will be full of armed cops. So first, 6 of our shortest guys will enter the booth in burqgas. Meanwhile, we will open firing in the market and distract the cops. As soon as the cops leave, you guys attack and capture the booth. Give me that camera. Grab the ballot boxes and run, but only if there aren't too many civilians. Or pour ink and shake the box... or just burn it. The rest of you will spread out and riot all day with guns and bombs. Terrorise all the neighbouring areas of the polling booths... ...So people get scared to even step out. A few of you will only keep an eye on the Polling Officer. When he heads towards us, one of you will inform him: "Sir, they're firing in the market area booth" The officer will rush to that booth through bad roads. Just as he realises he's been misinformed, an 'injured' guy will tell him: "1 was at the booth in the college area, they shot us and cast our votes by force." And like this, we will keep setting up decoys and capture all 14 booths. [Tangent:] Everyone get the fuck out of here. Make sure Faizal Khan doesn't win! Where's Definite? Call him. [Guddu:] Talk of the devil! Hello... We've just stepped out for inspection. Get there fast. Okay. He'll meet us at the booth. Brother... ...how about a quick visit to the shrine first? They say all prayers get answered there. Alright. [Iglakh:] Does everyone need to come? I'm sure everyone would like to pray. 1 think more people will mean more time. Guddu, ask the others to stay back. You guys wait at the gate. We'll be back soon. [Faizal:] Is this it? [Iglakh:] This one's for the tourists. The real one's ahead. Why are you sweating so much? It's just... this heat, brother. [Faizal:] Guddu...! [Faizal:] Who the fuck shot him? What the...? Guddu, you're shooting me... Iglakh, motherfucker! Want to kill me, motherfucker? Uglakh:} Oh, 1 won't. Then who will? So who'll kill me. Tell me, motherfucker... Where is he? They're behind the wall. Come out, brother. Nobody will kill you now. Where the fuck were you, asshole? Someone shot Guddu. That was my mistake, brother. Their shirts were so similar, 1 shot Guddu mistaking him for 1glakh. This was the best time to kill him. - But who changed the plan ? Ramadhir, who else! - Let's go. I'd told you, brother. - Let's go to him. But he's scheduled to come to the... - Fuck his schedule! How can he attack suddenly! Even 1 need to prepare myself. [Guddu:] Watch before you shoot, bugger! [Faizal:] You can't talk, Guddu! Faizal...? [Mohsina:] What the hell is this? You said you were going to quit! Let me go today... I promise I'll quit tomorrow. You need to be alive to quit. I swear on you, I'll come back alive. Faizal, please don't go. 1 am pregnant. Tell the baby his father says 'hello! Whatever's wrong, dear... Whatever's wrong, set it right, dear. Don't lose hope, and try to fight some more, dear. Fight some more, my dear fool. Whatever's wrong, set it right, dear. Don't lose hope, and try to fight some more, dear. Fight some more, my dear fool. Don't feel frustrated, my fool... Don't be nervous, my fool... Don't feel frustrated, my fool... Don't be nervous, my fool... Don't let anything upset your mood... anytime, my dear fool. Why are our guys following us? [Faizal:] Hey, Guddu... Tell them we don't need them. [Guddu:] But we might, brother. Faizal Khan doesn't need anyone's protection. [Guddu:] You guys don't have to cover us. [Guddu:] 'Cos brother says so, fucker. Gimme your phone. No one will shoot... ...'Cos every single bullet in Ramadhir's body will be mine. They're saying another Hello! Greetings, sir. Faizal Khan is history. But in the process Guddu killed Iglakh. [Definite:] So I had to kill Guddu. Where's his dead body? [Definite:] I'm on my way to the hospital. The bodies are with me in an ambulance. [Henchman:] Yes, he's here. They're in there. Hello...? [Patient:] They're firing outside! Hold this. Stay alert! Keep your guns handy. [Faizal:] Definite...! Why are you trying to hold water in your palms, fool? Don't you know you can't hold water in your palms, dear fool? It's meaningless... it's nature is to slip away. It's time to rev that brain, you fool, time to catch that train, you fool. It's time to rev that brain, fool... it's time to ignite. Please stop your craziness and act sane, dear fool! Times are strange, life is fragile... ...50 don't be rash, my fool. And when life gives you a chance, fool... ...you know you shouldn't refuse! I beg you, dear fool, please don't refuse...! Want some tea? I'll have some. Bring him outside. [Nasir:] We left Wasseypur. Mohsina wanted us to shift to Bombay. Wasseypur was not affected by either Faizal or Ramadbhir's deaths. It was a battlefield then, like it is today... ...and will perhaps always remain one.
