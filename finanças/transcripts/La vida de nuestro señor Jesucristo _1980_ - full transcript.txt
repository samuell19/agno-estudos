In the beginning... God created the heavens and the earth. And God separated the light from the darkness... and the waters from the land. And he created the fish and the birds... and the wild beasts... and the domestic animals. And He saw that what He did was good. And finally He said, “Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness." So God took clay from the earth and created man. And He placed man in the Paradise of Delights to harvest and rule over it. And God said to Himself, "Is not good for man to be alone, let's make him a helper and company similar in his image, and God gave man this precept, telling him, eat of the fruit of all the trees in paradise, but from the tree of good and evil and science, do not eat. If you eat from that tree, you would certainly die. The woman saw that this fruit was good and beautiful, and she ate from it. And she offered it to her husband. And he also ate. Adam and Eve's sin was the first offense made from man to God. And that is how God expelled Adam and Eve from the Paradise of Delights, for him to work the ground from which he was brought. For the human race to be forgiven, God, the Father sent his son Jesus, called Christ, our Lord... to save us. This is the story of Jesus and His doctrine. And this is the Holy Land, where all these events took place 2000 years ago. Hail Mary, Blessed are you among women God is with you Mary, do not be afraid For you have found grace in the eyes of God You will have a son. I am God's servant. May Your will be done within me. Sirino! Governor of Siria! To you, subjects of Cesar Augustus! I make an announcement, with date of the year 750 of the foundation of Rome! It is the will of your emperor to execute a population census to this province! Joseph, accompanied by Mary, who was pregnant, traveled from Nazareth to Belen, where he had been born, to register for the census as ordered by Sirino, the Roman chief. At the same time, through another route, The three wise men from the East, Melchior, Gaspar and Balthazar, they were traveling following a star guiding their path to the place where the Redeemer was about to be born. Look... Belen. Joseph, why don't we shelter on that grotto? No, it is not suitable. I am pleading you, just go see. Fine, Mary. It is a stable, I cannot allow you to stay there. I have friends and family in the city, They will give us refuge, let's go. Fine. Innkeeper! Innkeeper! Go on your way good man, there is no room here. Someone will give us room. May God wish it so. What do you want? Ephraim, don't you recognize me? I am Joseph. We need a place to stay. May God be with you, I don't even have room for my own father. - I am so sorry Joseph. - But... Goodbye. Ephraim... Joseph, let's go back to the grotto. Fine. Don't be afraid. I bring you new of great joy. Today the Savior was born. The Lord's Christ. You will find the child at a manger in swaddling clothes. In a grotto at the city's gates. Follow me! Follow me! Brothers. The star has disappeared. We are in the proximity to Jerusalem. Your excellencies, we should pay King Herod a courtesy visit. Yes. He may tell us about that long-awaited birth. We are in his lands, we should not offend him by ignoring his sovereignty. Brothers. Let's pay King Herod a visit. Hail to you, venerable and exalted. We are very pleased with your visit. You surprised us by not telling us about your arrival to honor you as you so deserve. We have been traveling by night alone. Don't you find it strange your servants haven't noticed our presence? During the day, we become be invisible to the human eye. We know about your science. No matter the reason for your travels, you are welcome here. First of all, we welcome you to accept these humble gifts. Your mere presence is a gift to us. You have our gratitude. But, you haven't told us the reason for your travels. We have come to worship the King of Kings. Then, how come you have not directed your steps to Roma to worship our divine emperor Augustus? This King is the awaited one. The Son of God. The Messiah. The One to reign over all the kings and all the races. Where is he? Tell me so I can also come and worship Him. We have come following the star. But our search is not yet over. Accept our hospitality and rest here. On your way back, come and let us know if your quest has been fruitful. Go one Joseph. Please, stop. For a long time now I have been in this temple waiting for the Savior's arrival. The Holy Spirit has given me the promise that my eyes won't meet death until they have seen the Lord's Christ. A sword will pierce your soul, your very own soul so the thoughts of numerous hearts will be manifested in you. Mary. I, Anna the prophet daughter of Samuel, from Aser's tribe, I tell you Oh Mary, upon you will befall the blessings to all the generations. Because the Savior was born from your womb, the Savior you are carrying in your arms. Holy Holy Holy. Leave them Mary, don't interrupt their prayers. Let's go. We have to hurry and go back to Belen. You don't want to come to our house? We need to stay in Belen until we get registered and maybe even longer. There are lots of jobs there for a carpenter. Cousin Isabel, I promise to spend a few days with you once we are installed. Of course. - See you later Zachariah. - Bye Joseph. Let's go Mary. - Goodbye Mary. - Goodbye. Gentleman, may peace be with you. The star has guided us to this place. We have come to worship the Lord's Christ. The newborn. Welcome. We have completed our mission. We are happy on earth and we will be happy in the next life. Because our earthly eyes have seen the Savior of the world. May you be blessed Virgin Mary, and you Joseph, holy and noble gentleman. - May God be with you. - May God be with you. But, who are you, noble gentlemen? We are three Kings from the East who have come to offer three gifts to our Lord. Please, come in. Gold for you my Lord, for you are the King. Myrrh. This is a symbol of health, my Lord, because you are a man. Incense, my Lord. Because you are God. Most venerable, our people have waited impatiently for the Messiah. What can you tell to a mother's heart? Will he be a warrior? A leader who subdues the other nations by force of weapons? His weapons will be His words and His love. And He will conquer every heart. Oh, without wars? Without wars. But only with His suffering and His sacrifice. He will be called the Lamb of God that takes away the sins of the world. Will His life be marred by pain? The pain suffered by the Son of God will redeem all men equally. He will give His body and spill His blood. For men to receive forgiveness. He will be killed on the cross. The cross? His hands will be pierced by nails. His brow will bear a crown of thorns. You asked for the truth. We had to tell you the truth. A sword will pierce your soul, your very own soul, so the thoughts of numerous hearts will be manifested in you. John, grab it. - Good job. - Look John. - Good job. - Help me cousin John. Take him that way. What a good boy. John, you are a good shepherd. Let's go in and eat something. - Let's go. - Come in Zachariah. Those two cousins are adorable. God's grace have come upon us. If we could only freeze these moments. - Yes. - Watch Jesus and Juan play as such. It is terrifying to know what the Lord has prepared. Yes. My son will be the voice that cries out in the wilderness. He will ready the path of the Lord. He will straighten the ways. He will baptize men with water So that the one who comes after him baptizes them with the Holy Spirit. So many sorrows await us. Yes. Please, don't let anything somber the happiness of this moment. Joseph, where is the boy? I don't know. I though he went with you to the well. What happened? Why are you so agitated? The whole town is filled with soldiers. In Belen? Yes. I also thought it was strange. I am very scared. We are people of peace. No one will want to hurt us. I am afraid for the boy. He must be with the neighbors. Why don't you go look for him? I would go but... look. I made a measuring mistake when I cut this piece of wood. I will have to replace it and our profit will be gone. And it is ebony. The most expensive wood. You must have been distracted. Yes. I was thinking that... I am too old. Everyday it gets harder to make ends meet. And all of the sudden, this happens. Look... there he is. Jesus. What are you doing my son? I went to see the soldiers Please, we don't want you wondering away from the house. Play close by, where we can see you. I cannot play if you are sad. Look, I am going to tell you what is happening. I had an accident. You see this piece of wood? It got shorter than this other one. And it is a very refined piece of wood. Ebony. And I cannot add to it or fix it. Stretch it. Well... wood doesn't stretch. Yes, look. Go play son, but don't wander too far from the house. Yes mother. To think that we need to raise him in the midst of poverty. And why not, Joseph? The Lord allowed Him to be born in a humble manger. Stop! No one is allowed to carry weapons in Belen! I am only carrying this sword, there are beasts in the desert and bandits in the mountains If you want to enter Belen, you have to leave it behind. Leave it... or fight against me. I promise to keep it at home and not hurt anyone. First you talk back and then you want to fight? No. Take the sword. What am I going to do with two swords? Take it, you coward! Take it! Do you think that bug is going to thank you? Mary, I have good news. - I got the job! - God heard our pleas. Yes. But, how are we going to educate him? You will teach him your trade. A carpenter? Him? Such a humble job? He wanted to live with the humble. Scribe. Take this dictation. It is our royal decree that every male boy under the age of three that lives or has been born in Belen will be immediately put to death. Voice this order at once. Centurion, I am going on my guard round. Herod finally sent his orders. About time, when do we go to battle? It has nothing to do with battle. The Augustus' soldiers have a less pleasant task. We are soldiers, we have to obey. Some orders should not be followed. I wish I had time to consult the Syrian consul. Is the order that serious? Read. All the little ones in Belen will be dead by tomorrow. All of them will die. - Better. - What? That way we eliminate the future Roman enemies at its source. There is one I am fixated upon! Herod offers a reward for obedience and loyalty. With or without a reward I am willing to obey him. We are ready to go. I never thought Herod would throw a party for the town. It is true, today he celebrates the birthday of his son Archelaus. We all love our children. Even kings. Have fun son. Why don't you come with us? It is a party only for little children. And you cannot come because you are big. Yes. Go and have fun. Draw swords! Point! Eyes forward! Ready! Joseph of Nazareth You will take the boy and His mother and you will take them to the land of Egypt. Great danger is upon them. Mary, the boy is in danger. Let's go fast! - Where are we going? - To Egypt! We are not carrying anything? No, nothing. We have no time to lose. Hide the child under the cover. Let's be quiet. Go. Because of the persecution King Herod had against them the Holy Family had to flee to Egypt for the prophecy would be fulfilled. "I called my Son from Egypt." Don't worry Mary. We are safe in the desert. The Lord won't abandon us, Joseph. That is right, Mary. Let's go. Grab the Hebrew! I want this one! - Let's go! - Yes! Go! My boat. What do you have there? Come here. What is this? My teacher gave it to me. You will have to finish this cross by tomorrow. The judges have condemned this criminal to be crucified the day after tomorrow. What do you say, Joseph? This is a judge's order. You cannot disobey. Think about it. Amrot... I make beds to rest after working all day. Tables to share bread. Plows to make the earth produce. Coffins that guard the remains of those who die. Cribs for the newborn. I neither want nor can make instruments of infamy or torture. If I were you, I would say the same thing. Thank you Amrot. May the Lord reward your good heart. And may your God protect you, Joseph. Joseph, you should rest. You are worried about something. Mary, I am busy. I have to make some drawings. But if we are able to leave Egypt, where would we go? Back to our land. Herod ordered that terrible massacre to kill the child. He knows we escaped the soldiers. I don't want to imagine what would happen when we go back. Whatever he has planned, it will happen. Let's pray so He will show us the way and we will follow His will. You are always telling the truth. Fine. Go on and rest. I will ask His Holiness advice and guidance. Then Mary, Joseph and the child Jesus, fulfilling all the things foretold by the Law of the Lord, went from Egypt to Galilee and to his hometown of Nazareth. Once in a while, Joseph would go to the sea, it was near the town He would repair the fishermen's boats. And he would take little Jesus, who passed the time playing with his dog. Jesus was growing up and becoming stronger. And he liked learning his father's trade. His intelligence was exceptional and his wisdom astonishing. And the Grace of God was in him. How much for the calf? 15 coins for the cow. It is cheap. I can't but it, I don't have that much. - Sir! - How much for the calf? Buy it for 12 coins. - You don't want it? - I don't have that much. It is impossible to give it for less. Seriously. - I don't have enough. - It is worth at least 15. How much are you willing to give? Sir! Don't leave! - It is cheap. - For this little one? - Six. - No less. I can't, sorry. - How much? - God loves the birds the most. - Too expensive. - How much do you have? - I can sell them for three coins. - Here you go. They take advantage with these prices. For what I paid for this dove, I could've gotten a calf in Galilee. And why don't you bring it from there? The priests demand that the animals used in sacrifices to be bought here. And in the currency they coin themselves. Since Roman coins don't circulate here, they also take advantage of the travelers. Let's go in already. Let's meet here when we get out. May God bless you. She is going in alone? Yes, she is going to the side of the temple reserved for women. You can come with me. To the side reserved for the men. Because you are already young men. Let's go. Let's go Jesus! Hurry up! Why father? Because we need to get in line for the sacrifice. The book says, When you go to the house of God, keep your foot. And get ready to listen than to make sacrifices to the foolish. It is surprising to hear that observation. Especially coming from a child. Not so much for being a child as for being a Galilean. The will of the Lord made us Galileans and we thank Him for that. Besides, your surprise has no foundation. No? Galileans are so ignorant, they come every year to receive beatings. You never learn. But you are welcome in our land. Galilee? Who wants to go to Galilee? Who are you trying to incite? An old man and a child? If the weak incites, he is a fool. But if the strong incites, he is a fool and a coward. We need to arrive to the knowledge of truth! Order reaches the hierarchy of men! - The truth of the common is foolishness! - Who leads us to truth? One moment! One moment honorable men! We shouldn’t speak all at the same time! Where were you children? That's where they teach scripture. Come, we need to go back to Nazareth. Joseph, you didn't present the sacrifice? No, because... oh my God... I'll go back. No father, give it to me. But, what did he do? Calm down Joseph, he knows what he is doing better than ourselves. Let's go Jesus, your parents are way ahead. To determine what is the supreme virtue is of great importance in order to guide our people towards it. It is clear that all virtues are important. To keep tradition. The knowledge of the Torah. Observing the commandments of scripture. Wisdom. Justice. Prudence. Who are you? You answer first, is it wise for someone to ask the son who He is in the house of his Father? Toss the intruder away! No. Let's have some fun. If this is the house of your father, he must be a rich and powerful man. That is right. And this house is not worthy of Him. You think this magnificent high-ceiling building is poor? To the house of man God has put the whole sky as a roof. Where does he come from? Do you think excessive what your are giving to God? Do you think little what you receive from Him? We laugh at your loss. On the contrary. The one is not able because he is lost scoffs at Him. What are the things this kid is saying? Scoffing is the mask of incapacity and powerlessness. Who scoffs at the powerful in his own presence? The scoffing is cruel because is a cowardice! Don't scoff. I thank you for your praise. He who recognizes merit shares it. That is what I said. How did you guess it? You couldn't have heard us. Child, where did you learn all this? You should answer me that, wise men. Isn't your mission to instruct the people? - Yes. - The teach me. Where is Jesus? I don't know. I thought he was with you. No. I thought he was with you. We shouldn't be afraid. He and John must be playing with the other boys. John! Where is Jesus? Upon leaving Jerusalem he was absorbed in his thoughts. I didn't want to interrupt his meditation. - Go and look for him! - Yes, sir. Mary, let's go look for him. Have you seen Jesus? - Have you seen Jesus? - Not at all. - Have you seen Jesus? - We haven't seen him, sir. He is not in the caravan, he has not come with us. No one has seen him. Calm down Mary, let's wait form him here. He must be coming with the late crowd. Ho Joseph, no. I beg you, let's go back to Jerusalem. Let's do as you wish. Innkeeper! Innkeeper! Oh my God. Don't worry Mary, he must be here. He gets distracted when he starts on his meditations. May that be so. - You want a room? - You don't remember me? I am Joseph, from Nazareth. I thought you had left already. Our son Jesus must be here. I haven't seen him, but you can go in and look for him. The highest attribute that God has given man is wisdom. And a wise man, is a prudent one. So, prudence is the supreme virtue. Courage is the supreme virtue. No one has ever called courage a virtue. What is the opposite of a virtue? - Have you seen a kid this tall dressed in white? - No. Have you seen a kid this tall in a white tunic? No sir, I haven't seen him. My God. Mary, Mary! Mary, the temple is closed at this time. It's after the passover. Go in and look for him. But... Fine. This means... what virtue is possible without courage? But, cowardice bears all vices. Fear of work breeds idleness and laziness. Fear of temperance pushes man into drunkenness and gluttony. Vices and sin, are nothing but fear. Fear and cowardice! Tell us, kid. You think courage is the supreme virtue? - That is correct! - And fear bears all vices? That is correct! Then the fear of God, for the fact that is a fear, should it bear vices? How do you explain that? God's commandments order us to do good or bad? Good, obviously. - Whoever does good, obeys God. - Yes. Whoever does good, disobeys God. True. Who should fear, the one who obeys or the one who disobeys? The one who disobeys, of course. So, the fear of God, is the fear of disobeying God. Meaning, of doing bad. What a child. Where does he come from? Courage is strength. Fear is weakness. Remember the prophets. They have all been different from each other. Moises, Joshua, Isaiah, David, Solomon Elijah Haven't they've been brave men? He even knows about the old prophets. Is he calling us cowards? My son, how could you forget about us? Why mother? Don't you know that I should attend my Father's business? John, come closer. The Lord has seen the purity of your soul. I baptize you with water. But after me comes one who is more powerful than me. And I am not worthy to untie the straps of his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit. I believe in you teacher. Your forgiveness will bring me peace. Who are you to impose such authority? I am the voice that cries out in the desert. You call a desert to all these wretched men who believe what you are preaching? The desert is the fools who hear and don't listen. Who see but don't look. I am preparing the way of the Lord. For all men to see the salvation that comes from God. We don't need you to abide by Him. You are a race of vipers. Who has taught to flee from the wrath that is to come? You need to give penance for the hatchet is already at the root of the tree. And the tree that doesn't give good fruit will be cut and toss into the fire. Your words stir the populace. King Herod will know to to quiet your sin. The patriarch fears the power of Rome. But the fear of God will be good for his soul. Lord. I don't deserve to be baptized bu you, yet you come to me. Thus it is convenient that we fulfill all justice. John the Baptist, arise. May it be so. That was the time when Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and He was baptized in the Jordan River by John the Baptist. Lord. Receive the baptism of penance You, who are to give us the baptism of forgiveness. And then the Holy Spirit called Him to the desert. And He was in the desert for 40 days and 40 nights. There, He was tempted by Satan. Matthew 3:13 At that moment, He only wanted to be a man with all the weaknesses and conditions of a human being going through thirst and hunger embraced by the torrid sun during the day shivering with cold at night and exposed to the inclement of sandstorms. You are a man, weak, tired and hungry. If you indeed are the Son of God turn those rocks into bread. Man doesn't leave of bread alone but from every word that comes from the word of God. You are a man, a feeble creature. I will give you all the kingdoms of the world if you bow down before me and adore me. Away from me Satan for it is written You will worship only the Lord your God, and to Him alone you shall serve. Whoever has two garments give one to whom has none. And whoever has food, do the same service. - Get out of here! - You are not welcome here! That's the criminal. Arrest him! - What do you want to know? - Have you talked badly about the patriarch? I said that he did wrong. But, he is at fault of his doings and I am at fault of my words. So, you confess! You will go to prison for this crime. As you wish. I have fulfilled my task. Can we do something for you, teacher? Just wait. Wait in faith for the return of the Lord. - Don't take him! - Let him be! - Go away! - The king will kill him! - Get out of here! - Let the teacher go! Is it true that the people follow you and you plan to raise them against me? It is not against you. Nor against any kingdom of this world. If so, imprisonment has been your punishment and you can leave. But you need to leave Galilee. And if you dare to come back my soldiers will kill you. Are you that afraid of my words? I don't know who you are. Some say you are a prophet. Other say that you are possessed. All I want is not to raise the emperor's anger. The holy Tiberius. I only want to govern with justice. Then be the first one in giving the example. What are you accusing me of? You live with that woman, Herod. She is as full of sin as you are. The wife of your brother Philip. Lies! She is my wife now! It is not lawful for you to have her. Galilee shall not be governed by adulterers! Throw him back in prison! Kill him. Andrew and Simon, sons of Jonah. Follow me. Get away from me, for I am a sinful man. Don't be afraid, follow me. Father, here comes the man who preaches the holy word. May peace be upon you. And upon you, Lord. John and James, sons of Zebedee. Follow me. - Can I, father? - You can, son. - What about me, father? - You may also go, my son. Philip, follow me. Wait! Wait a moment! What are you thinking about, Simon? These ignorant shepherds. There he is! I see there is not insincerity in you. How do you know me, Galilean? Before Phillip called you I saw you under the fig tree playing the flute. Lord. You are the Son of God. You believe because I said I saw you under the fig tree? You will see greater things than these. Follow me. Next. Issac, some of Abraham three denarii. Levy, from now on your name shall be Matthew. Follow me. Hail to you, Jesus. I am Judas, Judas Iscariot. I want to be one of your men. So that what must be accomplished is fulfilled. Come. Follow me Judas Iscariot. Madam, even though your son hasn't tasted the wine he seems very happy. God attracts happiness. We run out of wine. I don't know what we would do. The party can't continue without wine. And it is impossible to get it now. It will be a humiliation to the hosts. What a humiliation. Sir, sir, the guests are asking for more wine, but there is none. What? We got more than enough. But because of the warm weather and the dancing. Son, my Lord. They run out of wine. Mother, what is that to you or me? My time has not come yet. Go get more. No matter the price! Do whatever my son tells you. Fill those pitchers with water. Sir, they already have water, for the purification. Sir, taste this wine. Give me a scroll. - Which one, Lord? - Whatever you'd like. Isaiah. The Spirit of the Lord rests over me. He has consecrated me with his anointing and has sent me to give the good news to the poor, to heal those who have a contrite heart, to announce freedom to the captives, to give sight to the blind, to release the oppressed, to announce the year of the Lord's mercies, and the day of retribution. The writings of the prophet Isaiah have been fulfilled. He has been possessed by a demon. Let me cure him. A demon inhabits him. Be silent and leave this man. What happened? What has he done to him? Thank you. - A miracle. - Oh my God. - He did that. - Look at the man now. This was done by the justice of God. Thank you. Divine justice. Lord. If it is your wish, you may heal me. I wish it so. Be clean. Thank you, Lord. Do penance, the Kingdom of the Heavens is at hand. Lord are you indeed a prophet? I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me, will not hunger again. And whoever believes in me, will never thirst. Have pity for this poor blind man. Some coins for this poor blind man. Lord! Lord! I am a blind man, but I can hear your steps. You are the son of God, return my sight. Return the light to my eyes. Your faith has saved you. Wash your eyes. It is true that you are the Light of the World! I can see. I can see again. I can see again! Look at that man, he has cured the blind. On a Sabbath! Jesus of Nazareth!, you have blasphemed! Blasphemed? Yes. You have cured that man on a Sabbath. Who among you, if a sheep falls into a pit on a Sabbath, you don't get it out? How much valuable is a man than a sheep? Therefore, it is lawful to do good on a Sabbath. He is right. Ask me for whatever you want. I swear I will give it to you, even if it is half my kingdom. Ask him for John the Baptist's head served on a platter. Yes. I want that. Remember that you swore to it. May it be so. Bring me the head of John the Baptist. Lord. It is always painful to see a young man dying. Today I have also received great pain. Rabbi. My son has died. The only son God gave me. I am in so much pain! Calm down, woman. Bring him down. Young man... I order you... Get up. It is in the power of God to do what is impossible for man. - Go away! - Get out of here! - Kill her! - Stone her! Silence! Rabbi! This woman has been caught in adultery. The law of Moses orders us to stone women like her to death. - Stone her! - Kill her! Calm down! What do you say to this? Answer us Rabbi! Or, you don't want us to fulfilled the law of Moses? Whoever is free from sin, throw the first stone! Woman, where are your accusers? Have them condemned you? None of them, Lord. I don't condemn you either. Come. And sin mo more. Lord. Why this perfume has not been sold in 300 denarii and distribute it among the poor instead in wasting it like that. If this man were truly a prophet - he would know what type of woman she is. - True. I have to tell you something. A creditor had two debtors, one owed him 500 denarii and the other 40. Not having a way to pay him, he forgave them both the debt. Who would love him more? Whoever was forgiven the most. You judged correctly. Do you see this woman? I tell you, her sins have been forgiven because she loved abundantly. Your sins have been forgiven. Who is that who is so blasphemous? Only God can forgive sins. What is easier to say? Your sins have been forgiven or get up and walk? So you can see that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins I say to the paralytic, I command you, carry your stretcher and go home. The glory of God is upon Jesus of Nazareth! Go in peace. I truly say to you, you will see the opening of the heavens and the angels of God fly and come down upon the Son of Man. Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go. The moles have burrows. And the birds have nests. But the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head. Rabbi, my father is very old and is about to die. Lord, allow me to go and bury him first. You, follow me and let the dead bury the dead. Good teacher. What should I do to attain eternal life? You know the commandments. Teacher, I have followed them since my youth. There is one more thing you need to do. Sell everything you own and give it to the poor. That way you will have treasure in heaven. How hard it is for the wealthy to enter the kingdom of heaven. It is easier it is for the camel to pass through the eye of a needle than a rich man to enter the kingdom of eternity. You know that we have renounced to everything and have followed you. I assure you, that no one who has left their home, or brothers, sisters and children or their inheritance to pursue my love and that of my Father's will receive their reward during this age and eternal life in the age to come. Many of you who are the first, will be the last. And many of the last will be the first. Lord. This place is away from the town. Why don't you tell the people to get something to eat? They don't need to go anywhere You can feed the crowd. Teacher, 200 denarii of bread would not be enough for each of them to taste a bite. Sir, here is a boy who has five barley loaves and two fish. How can this feed a large crowd? Sit down! You will receive food! Bring baskets. Ask and you will receive! Look and you will find! Call and it will open. Whoever asks will receive. Whoever looks will find. Whoever calls, the doors will be open to them. Don't look at the straw in your brother's eye ignoring the beam in your own eye. Who among you, if your son asks you for a loaf of bread you give him a stone? Or if he asks for bread you would give him a serpent? Well, if you being bad want good things for your children, How much more will your Heavenly Father give good things to those who ask Him. Blessed are the poor in spirit for the Kingdom of Heaven shall belong to them. Blessed be the meek, for they shall inherit the earth. Blessed are those that weep, for they shall receive consolation. Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for justice because they shall be satisfied. Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy. Blessed are those with a pure heart because they shall see the face of God. Blessed are the peacekeepers. Blessed are those who suffer persecution because the Kingdom of Heaven belongs to them! Hosanna! Hosanna! Hosanna! Hosanna! Lord. There seems to be a funeral at your friend's house our friend Lazarus sleeps. Well, if he sleeps, he will get better. - Lord! - Oh Lord! I know if you had been here, my brother may not have died. Your brother will resurrect. I know he will resurrect on the last day. I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in Me, even if he is dead will live. Where is he buried? Lord, if you allow me to get up, I will take you. Lazarus, come forth! Father. I give you thanks, for you have heard me. Lazarus had already been locked up in the tomb for four days. Here. Now leave. He calls himself the king of Israel. If the people follow him we are doomed. Send people to divert the people's attention. They shall say... He will be the cause for Roma to destroy our country and they will take us captive like in the times of Babylon. - Holy! - Holy! - Hosanna. - The Son of God is here! - Hosanna! - Here comes the Lord! Hosanna! Hosanna! - The King! - The Son of God! Hosanna! Hosanna! The Son of God is here! Hosanna to the Son of God! The power of God is here! Open the way for the Son of God! Hosanna! Hosanna! The reports were not exaggerating. The people have always been apathetic. This is truly worrisome. We must act immediately! Hosanna! Hosanna! No! - No! - Careful! Out! Get out of here! Out! It has been written. The House of my Father shall be a house or prayer. In whose authority do you do these things? Who is it that has given you this power? I also want to ask you a question. Being baptized by John the Baptist, it is a work of man or God? We will not fall into the bait of your words. If we say God, you will say, "how come you didn't believe in him?" And if we say of man, the whole town will stone us because they knew John was a prophet. You don't answer. Then I won't tell you in whose authority I do these things. Teacher! It is lawful for us to pay tribute to Caesar or no? Show me a denarius. Whose image is it in the inscription? Caesar. Give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar. And to God what belongs to God. Don't keep gold, silver, or copper in your pockets. And no saddlebag for the road. Teacher, please come to my house. My daughter is dying! Teacher, please save her. Sir. Sir, your daughter has died. No! No! - They are shrouding her. - No! If you have faith, she will live. Take me there. Don't cry. The girl is not dead, only sleeping. Calita, rise up. Daughter! My little girl! My dear daughter. You heard the saying An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. On the contrary I tell you, If someone slaps your right cheek also offer him the left cheek. You heard the saying You will love your neighbor. On the contrary I tell you, love your enemies. Do good to those who hate you. Pray for those who persecute or slander you. Don't listen to the hypocrites who make promises and flatter you to have power over you. Before you follow those false prophets examine their works. The tree is known by its fruit The grapes are not harvested from the brambles and the thorns. Be aware of those who proclaim justice to make themselves notable. And those who proclaim it when doing charity to receive honor from men. And don't hold treasure. Stored wheat can be consumed by moths and worms. Accumulated gold is at the mercy of thieves. No one can serve two masters. You cannot serve God and money at the same time. And observe this rule, Everything you want others done to you you must do for others. Everyone who has heard these words is the same as the one who builds their house on rock foundations. - Don't bother the Lord! - Wait! Wait! Let the children get close to me because the Kingdom of Heaven belongs to them. A man had two sons. And the youngest said, Father, I want to claim my inheritance. And the father divided his fortune. So, the young man, gathering everything his father had given him went far and far to a strange country and there he spent his whole fortune. Silence! What scandal is this in the temple? Kids, get out of here! Go! By what power do you do this? With the same one as these innocents. What? You cannot understand. Why not? Because you are a race of hypocrites! He has called us hypocrites. Yes. Whitewashed graves. We have to do something. Fast! He may stay in Jerusalem until the Passover. That is our chance to apprehend him. I give you a new commandment. Love one another. Lord, don't we already love one another? I truly, truly say to you. One of you will betray me. - How? - What is he saying? How is that possible? Lord, who is it? Whoever understands these words. What you plan to do, do it as soon as possible. 25, 26, 27... I followed him because I thought he was the king of Israel. And 30. In a little while, you won't see me anymore. But, after a while longer you will see me again. Where are you going, Lord? Where I am going, you cannot follow me. You will follow me later. Why can't I follow you? I would give my life for you. The rooster will not crow before you have denied me three times. That will never happen. Among you, there has been a strife over which one of you is the greatest. But I truly say to you that the most humble, the simplest, will be the first in the Kingdom of Heaven. My Father loves humbleness, and as a testimony, me, His Son, will wash your feet. Lord, you washing my feet? Whatever I am doing you cannot understand it now. I would never allow you to wash my feet. If I didn't wash you you will not partake with me. Come and eat. This is my body. And this is my blood of the New Testament that will be poured out for the redemption of sins. Peter. John. Andrew. Wait here while I go to pray. Peter, John, James. Follow me. My soul will be in sorrow until my death. Wait and watch with me. My Father. If possible, take this cup away from me. But may it not be as I wish. But Your will be done. Peter. John. James. Wake up. The hour is at hand. The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of sinners. Wake up. Let's go. The one who will deliver me is coming. The man you want is the one I will kiss. Oh Judas! You betray the Son of Man with a kiss. Away with him! Good job Peter! You have come out armed with swords and clubs As if you came to catch a criminal. Every day I was among you in the temple and you never apprehended me. But this is your day and the power of darkness is here. He is innocent! Don't take him! Bring him before Pilate. Bring the prisoner. - Guilty! - Guilty! - Let him go! - He is my master! What is this man accused of? We have found him perverting our nation and forbidding to pay tribute to Caesar saying that he is Christ the King. He is! Are you the King of the Jews? You have said it. - He is an impostor! - He is telling the truth! He negates the law of Moses. I find no crime in this man. He is guilty of death. If you had already judged him, why did you bring him to me? Out law forbids us to kill. That is why. Now you want to abide by the law of Rome. We always abide by it. Rome has not been offended here. He has raised up the people with his doctrine sown from Galilee throughout Judea. Is he Galilean? Yes from that land of Gentiles. I understand that Herod, the patriarch of Galilee has come to Jerusalem for the Passover. Let it be Herod who judges the Galilean. Bring this man to him. - Let him go! - He is innocent! Pilate took a wise decision. The Galilean should be judged by me. Do you order his death? No. I won't do that. I wanted to know if it was the Baptist who had come again. But he is not. You can leave in peace. He won't bother you again. I will bring him with me to Galilee. He will live in my courts and perform miracles for me. He cannot do miracles because he is an impostor. No, he is a performer, a magician. You I think I haven't heard of him? Why should he obey you? It's very simple. In exchange for his life. You... Turn this water to wine. So, you don't want to obey me? Will you condemn him to death? Not during the Passover. If it urges you so much, go back to Pilate. You have presented me this man as a troublemaker of the people. And behold, I questioned him in your presence and I haven't found him guilty of any of your accusations. Not even Herod, since I sent this man to him. And by the facts I see that he did not judge him worthy of death. Therefore after punishing him, I will set him free. - No! Kill him! - Kill him! To death! Let him go. - Put him to death! - Kill him! Come on my friends! Come greet the King of the Jews! Sit on your throne! Hail the King of the Jews. Pilate ordered to lash him. Here is the man. The King of the Jews. He has already been sufficiently punished for the crimes you accused him of. Now I will release him. - No! - No! We want him dead! Bring Barabbas. You already know that during the Passover festivities The benevolence of Rome customarily frees an inmate of your kind. Anyone you request. It could be between this criminal and this man. Who do you want me to pardon? Barabbas or Jesus, who is called the Christ. - Barabbas! - Barabbas! What should I do with Jesus? - Crucify him! - Crucify him! What is his wrongdoing? Crucify him! - Kill him! - Crucify him! - Put him to death! - Crucify him! I am innocent from spilling the blood of this just man. Pick up your cross. Now! Pick it up! - Wait! - Calm down! Let me go! I want to give my life for him! - We all want to do that. - Me too. But we must wait. If he doesn't want to free himself, what can we do? Holy, Holy. Daughters of Jerusalem don't cry for me. Cry for you and your sons. Blessed are the wombs that did not conceive and the breasts that did not breastfeed. Lord, you resurrected my daughter why don't you save yourself? My son. Now he is going to be crucified! It is your fault. I have committed the worst injustice in history. What do we care about what you are saying. Father... forgive them, they do not know what they do. I am thirsty. If you are the Christ! Save yourself! And also save us! What? You don't fear God? Even when being in the same torture? We deserve what we are going through We must pay the deserved penalty for the crimes we committed. He has committed no crime. Lord... Remember me when you have reached your Kingdom. Truly I tell you that today you will be with me in paradise. Woman, there is your son. John, there is your mother. Father, why have you forsaken me? It is finished. Father, in your hands I entrust my spirit. I truly cannot believe what my eyes are seeing. You don't know? We fed Him a honeycomb and a fish. The Lord has risen. We have seen Him. And He has been here with us! It has been fulfilled. The world has been saved! Humankind has been redeemed. The mission of the Son of God has been consummated. If I don't put my finger in the hole that nails made and my hand on the cut on his side I would not believe it. - How can you say that? - How dare you speak that way? Are you that incredulous? Thomas, put your fingers in my hands and stretch out your hand and put it on my side. Don't be incredulous, but loyal. My Lord. Thomas, you believed because you saw me? Blessed are those who did not see and believe. Come closer and receive the Holy Spirit. You can now go to all nations to preach the gospel. But before that, come to Galilee I will give you a sign of where you can find me. Simeon Cephas Peter... Do you love me? Lord, this is the third time you have asked me. You know all things You know well that I love you. Feed my sheep. I am calling you a rock and upon this rock I will build my church. And the gates of hell will not prevail against her. And I will give you the keys for the Kingdom of Heaven. And everything you tie on earth will also be tied in the heavens. And everything you untie on earth will also be untied in the heavens. Now you will not see me for a while and then you will always see me. Pray as I have taught you. Our Father, which art in heaven Hallowed be your Name Your Kingdom come. And forgive us our trespasses Just as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation But deliver us from evil. Amen. THE END
