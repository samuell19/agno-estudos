Stolen, her and her baby. They took them in so they could adopt them. - Really? - And then— Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten ... Do you have nothing to say? - No. You could apologize! - No, it wasn't me who kicked it. - So what? - So I don't have to apologize. - Who's she? - Don't know, never seen her before. - Enzo, come on. - Who do you think you are? What are you doing? He didn't do it on purpose. You need to be careful! - We didn't do it on purpose. - You didn't do it on purpose. - Are you stupid? - Just go away! I'm telling you he didn't do it on purpose. Okay! What's going on here? - She's looking for trouble! - It's okay, it's okay. - She's just arrived, all right? - How were we supposed to know that? - That's enough. - Calm down! - If you touch me I'll slap you. - No, nobody's slapping anyone. - She started it. - That's enough. - Just because she's new doesn't mean— - Vincent, can you—? - Go on! - Vincent will take you to class. Take your bags and get in. You're giving me a headache. Everyone get back to class. - But it's her fault— - you all right? Move. They're going to make me ill. You three, there! The cheerleaders, come on. A little faster, thank you. - Are you all right? THE PLAYGROUND let me introduce Anya. She's just arrived and will spend the rest of the year with us. Please give her a warm welcome. You can sit there. - Sir? That stranger tthere, will she be coming with us on school trips? She attacked us, why should she get to come? - First that stranger there has a name. Anya. And of course she'll be coming on trips with us. - We don't know her. - We'll get to know her. - Yes? - Where's Anya from? - She's from Australia. - Sir! - Yes, Jade? - My favourite aminals— - your favourite aminals? Congratulations! Quiet now. Quiet! Jade, what are your favourite animals? - Kangaroos. - Yes, good, but there are koalas there too. - Sir? Sir? In Australia, are they all savages? - Fabien!, she's not a savage! Australia is a country which is not savage at all. The aborigines have— - it is a bit though. - It's a very interesting country. We'll talk about it later with Anya. Now, since you're all so talkative, can someone tell her about our educational trip? Nobody? To tell us something interesting there's a lot less enthusiasm. Right. You're all here, so I don't need to do the roll-call. But you look very nervous this morning. So I have something to calm you down: A surprise written test. - Give us a break! - This is such a waste of time! - What kind of welcome's this supposed to be? - In a surprise written test, you'll see the word surprise! Close your notebooks, please. Thank you very much! Yes? - We've just had the weekend. - We've forgotten everything - what are you talking about? - Anya, answer as much as you can. Everyone else, do your best. You have 45 minutes including the two minutes lost in chatter. Without notebooks. This test will be marked. The marks will count towards your term average. Thank you. It looks really good. Fabien. Fabien! - No, stop! My meds! Give them to me! Stop! Is everything there? - There were six. Now there's only two. - We'll call your mother, don't worry. - He's ill, and you steal his medication? Would you like it if someone did that to you? Come on. You're going to see Vincent. Who wants to colour? - Me! - Yeah? - Don't run. No chatting with Anissa, Matis. Go on. It's rare to see a 5th grader in the study room. Welcome. There you are, that's where it happens. This blue isn't nice. I told them to change it. To green. The colour of money. It brings luck. What do you think? - Are you a teacher? - No, I'm an employee of the council. Were there people like me at your old school? - I didn't go to school in Australia. - Are you Australian? - No, I was travelling with my parents. - Were you away long? - Two years. - No school for two years? - I was homeschooled. - Ah, ok. If you were in Australia, did you watch the Australian Open? I don't know. - Really? The Australian Open? The Australian Open is one of the four grand slams in world tennis. I used to be a junior champion. I was no. 3 in the world, but I got injured so I quit. But I'd have just loved to see that. I wanted to see a final with Serena Williams. Her last final there was against her sister. Haven't you even heard of Serena Williams? There's no need to know about tennis. Her last final was against her sister, Venus. When she won, it was her 22nd or 23rd title. She made history because she was pregnant. Three months, I believe. Incredible, isn't it? What about Ashleigh Barty, you know her? - No. - Not even Ashleigh Barty? All the same, she's a star in Australia. I don't really like her game. She's always chip-chip-chipping. I don't like cheaters. But Serena plays it straight. She's—she's a force of nature. Ok. I've given myself a sore throat. Would you like something to drink? - No thanks. - Nothing? Not even iced tea? Alexine? - Yes? - Could you get me a drink? - No. - What do you mean, no? - You're joking? Are you really asking me that? - Where's the harm? - I have stuff to do, I'm looking after kids. - I can do that for you - No, go and get your own drink. You're not a star yet. - What's being a star got to do with it? If your father asks you to get him a drink— - you're not my father. - No, but as an example. - No, I'm not getting you a drink. I signed for 12 kids, not for 13. - Before it was like: Vincent, do you want me to bring you a croissant? Vincent, do you want something to drink? Vincent, if you're tired, use my rest day. And now you're like this. One extreme to the other. So much for trust! Fuck France. This'll teach me a lesson. Dad. - Hello. - Hello. Sorry, I'm ashamed to be late on the first day. They changed my schedule at the last minute. - There's no problem. But for Anya, regularity, sticking to schedules, is important. - I understand. It won't happen again. It went well? - Yes, very well. A little problem earlier with a ball, but— - what do you mean? - Nothing, just kids arguing. Nothing at all. Right, Anya? You'll tell him about it? Good. Goodbye, see you tomorrow, Anya. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - What happened? - I got hit by a ball. - On the head? - Yeah. That's why you're ugly now. One more pass after that one. - Ok. You promised tagine. - This is fine, though. - The mint tea's on its way. - Here. Brava! Family-made pasta. [Italian] You're scary! - Mint tea à la mode. - Thank you. Here. - They're beautiful. - Thanks. - But will they be any good? - Of course! Made with love. The pasta will be good, but what about the stuffing? - Right away. - We haven't tasted it. - Oh dear. I chopped small, like you said. - It's good, I can tell. It looks good. - Was school all right? - It was ok. I realized how stupid footballers are. In my school, anyway. - The stupidity of footballers— are all footballers stupid? Or just the ones at your school? - I don't know. You should see them: They're ugly, stupid— they don't know how to do anything besides playing their football. They're immature. - That's not only about football. - They haven't all travelled as much as you. You see, they're— - that doesn't change anything. - You've seen so much compared to others your age. - I don't like to sit still all day. Homeschooling was better— - would you prefer coming to work with me to carry boxes? - I can't take hanging around here any more. So ... are we ready, are we hot? - Come on! Oh no, it's broken. - No big deal, that's the end. Go on, glue it here— press firmly. Without making holes in it. There she is. Shall we go and talk to her? - If you want. Hi. - Hi. Hi. - How are you? - Hi. I'm Zoé, and he's Nils. - I'm Jade. - We're in the same class. - After what you did yesterday, the whole school's slagging you off, except us. - You were right not to put up with being bullied by Enzo and his gang. - Never seen anything like it. - It was really— - Since you're alone, we're going to look after you. - You look friendly. - I don't mind being alone. - That's not true. Nobody likes to be alone. - She's right. - It's true, no-one likes being alone. How do you manage it? Don't you get bored? It's really simple. The playground is like a map of the world. The footballers take up all the space. Enzo makes the rules. We're in year 5, so there's no bigger kids to stop him. The one who sucks up to him all the time, like a puppy, is Nathan. We used to be mates. But now he's as dumb as the rest. His mother's the Head of the school. - You're not concentrating! - They don't let girls walk on their territory. - Except romy. She never wanted to be friends with us. Neither do the card players, they won't go on the pitch. They stay over there. And over there, Océane and her gang. They never get tired. Always skipping. Faster, we're getting bored! - Real pests. - That's true. - And over there, that's us. - Yeah. No, madame, I didn't contest the fine. I just said that the markup was too much. I didn't get the letter. Maybe someone stole it from my mailbox. It's not my fault. What can I do? So when I write in to appeal it, will everything be okay? Ok. No, I'm not eating. There's a problem with my phone. I've got the reference number, I'll write the letter. 775, b— Wait. Where are you going? - To the bathroom. - I'm warning you, if everyone did that, I'd never get out of here. Thanks a lot madame, you've been very kind. What are you doing here? - Study period. You? - I live here with my mother. She's— - the Head. I'll leave you to play. - Wait. You won't tell anyone about it? - Can I have a look? - Yeah, if you like. - Thanks. What is it? - A therizinosaurus. - A what? - A therizinosaurus. - Where's it from? - It lived in Mongolia, near China. And—it was a herbivore. It was eight meters high. With claws 80 cm long. - And yours? - That's a T-Rex. It lived in North America, with a few in South America too. It was a carnivore, 13 meters long. - Would you have liked to live in their time? - It depends which ones. - What's this? - That's my parachutist. I made it with string and a piece of refuse bag. - That's original. Does it really work? - Yeah. I've another one. We can both play. - Yeah, I'd love that. - Shall I get it? - Ok. You're dead. I've been shooting at you for two hours! What's this? Oh yes! "Control centre, this is space captain. Let's drop a parachutist." "I repeat, drop a parachutist." One, two, three. He's on the banister. Will you give me soldiers, so I can do some parachutists? - If you want. I've got plenty. We will have an army of parachutists. - It's all tangled up. Morning, kids. Morning, Zoé. - Hello. - Hello Anya. Hi, Nils. Jade. Morning, Enzo. Hi there. Hi. Hi. - Hi. Any news from the parachutist? - Nathan! - Enzo, who do you think you are? - Sorry, sir, we need exercise. - Come and see me after class. - Why? I haven't done anything! - You threw your bag at your friend! - Nonsense. - Of course you did. - He didn't do it on purpose. - Yeah yeah. Here we go. Geography notebooks. - Why are you talking to her? We ignore her. - She asked me something. - You're in love. - No. - Nathan's in love. - No! - They'll make baby kangaroos! He's in love! - Why are you in love with that girl? - I'm not. I don't care about her. He's in love! - Enzo, am I disturbing you? Stop it! What are these stories? He's in love? Take out your geography notebooks. A lesson about the rivers of France. The wild river, the longest in France, the Loire, rises at Mont Gerbier des Joncs. M, o, n, t, g, e, r, b, i, e, r, des joncs, j, o, n, c, s. Who d'you think's cutest? Ron, Harry, or the blond one, Malfoy whatshisname? Draco Malfoy. - I'd rather have—Voldemort. - No, he's not on the list. - Ron isn't very handsome. - Actually yeah, he's all right. No, actually, he's okay. I don't know, Ron and Harry Potter, they're my faves. - What about the girls? - Hermione? - Yes that's her. Yeah. And you, do you prefer Ginny or Hermione? Do you know Harry Potter? They can't do that! - What? - They're taking up the whole playground. - We told you about that. There's nothing we can do. - We'll start a rebellion. Here it is. My favourite shop. Remember that? Alice and Soraya played that game in year 3! - Oh yeah that's right! - Everybody laughed at them. Remember? - It's lovely. - Come inside. - It's even better. - Come on. - Hello, Nathalie! You all right? - I'm so happy to see you! - Yeah. - How you've grown! Thanks. - How are you? - I'm doing well. - Your parents? - They're fine. - Your little brother? - He's fine. - I ran into your grandmother. - Oh did you? - In tip top shape. It made me very happy. Anyway, what can I do for you? - We're looking for a game that'd need lots of space in the playground. One that everybody can play. - Make football teams. - No, definitely not! - No! - Anything but that. - I see. A skipping rope? - We've got plenty. - Pucks for hopscotch? - We already have some. - Knucklebones? Super skilful. - Oh, that's ancient! - No, you're exaggerating! - No we're not! - It's an excellent game of skill. Let me think a minute ... I have a good idea. An iresistible game. Universal. You'll love it. - Great! Thank you! - Let me have a look. - You see? She's the best. - You can find everything in here. If she finds— - everything's fine. - That's wonderful. Yes. - I can't wait to see what it is. Hi, Nils! - Hi. - Look, a turtle! - That's not funny. - Don't touch him, you cowards! Bunch of clowns! Leave him alone! - You've got a psychological issue. Don't do that to him! Don't do that to him. You don't like me doing it to you, so don't do it to others. How are you, Nils? - I'm fine. Look. I had an advance on my birthday. - They're wonderful. - I don't know what to say. - Where is it? - There. - Thanks. - They're so beautiful. Especially this one. - They both are. Them again. - Could you stop? Two minutes. - Please. Just look. - What? - There's an awesome new game, just released. It's everywhere! - Ok. We were busy. Couldn't you see that? - Anyway, it's marbles. Soon it'll be all the rage in every playground. - If it was all the rage, we'd know about it. Do you see anyone playing with them? - There's Anya, Jade, Zoé— - All the losers. - And me. - We'll stick with the skipping rope. - Only fools don't change their mind. - You're too much. Leave us alone. - Too bad for you. - Whatever. - Hi girls. Do you want to play marbles? - No thanks. - It's so cool. 'Ll give you some. - No. - It's simple. - We don't want to play. - No sorry. - Are you sure? - Yes. - Ok. We move them forward first, starting with the biggest one. I'm putting it— shit. Stop. The black marble lost. The yellow one stays, along with the pink and the blue marbles. The blue one's lost. I pick up a big marble again to see who wins. - Very good, Jade, very well explained. We played that back in my day. We had the pot game. We put them in a pot and then tried to win them back. - Ok. - Good times. - Since the black marble always wins, we put it after the pink one. - Want to play marbles? - No. - Can you play? - No. - Sure? It's cool. - Yes. Where are you going? Brilliant! - You taking the piss? - Did she do this? - Well done! - Do you enjoy ruining recess? - I'd have taken that! - Okay, wait! Hold it! Stop! Enough! Leave her alone! - Enzo, please! - She needs to calm down! It's her fault! - She started this! - She needs to calm down! - Go and play over there. Thank you. It's not a big deal. That's enough. It's fine. We'll pick them up without you. You're a sicko! You're crazy. Crazy! You're really crazy! She wants us to slip on the marbles! - No. - You won't make any friends that way! Come on, let's play. - The ball's over there! Hey, I had this one. - Go ahead. - Hey, you've got plenty! - Imagine if he'd fallen! Who'd have picked him up? You're dangerous. Were there lots of marbles? - Yeah, a bucket that big. Can you help me? - I don't have the skills for that, I gave up in year 5, you think I understand? It's not for me. I was jogging yesterday on the Champlain Bridge. Suddenly, I hear noises even with my headphones on. I see a traffic jam. I'm like, "at this time of day? There's never snarl-ups on this bridge." A couple get out of the car. What do they want with me? Are they parents of former students? Did I do something bd to their children? Are they going to throw me off the bridge? But no, they were smiling. They say; "Sorry to bother you, but— "I don't know if you've ever been told you're stunning?" Yes, I've been told that many times. I'm not bragging. People tell me that in the street. But I answer: "No, not at all". So I don't show too much self-confidence. "As soon as we saw you, we had a revelation. "We've been doing this for 30 years. Never have we seen a face so perfect. "You're not very tall, but we can use your face." - Awesome! - "Your mouth is perfect." "Did you have injections?" I say no, and it's true, I can't afford injections on my salary. "And your smile! It's dazzling!" Yes, that's just the way my life is. In a couple of weeks, I'm off to Paris to do a mouth commercial. - That's awesome. - I want to talk to Anya about homework. - I can't hear you? - I want to speak to Anya. - I can't hear you. Go and see him, then come back here to finish off. What do you want? - It's not about homework it's just— actually—i like playing marbles. Maybe we could have a game together? - I thought you didn't care about me. - I—wasn't really thinking about what I was saying. - Good night, Nathan. - No, wait— What did he want with you? - Nothing. - He didn't want anything? So you spoke to him for nothing? Weird. What's his problem? He's looking at us like a spaniel waiting for adoption. He depresses me. Finished? Come on, you have 20 minutes left. You write well. - Thanks. What do you want me to tell you? - Maybe that we're leaving? We're leaving, we're off! We'll see something else. We were fine there. - Is leaving your only interest in life? - No, I want to be happy. Your mission in life is to leave. People are pissed off all day. I work like crazy for a small salary, and see my family for two seconds. That's not life. - Look at yourself! - Life, it's not— - You're the one who's sulking! Everything is negative with you. I don't recognize you. What are you talking about? Responsibilities—that's fine! We've been like this for 10 years. What worries me most, is I don't understand you any more since we came here. - I'm more of a weathervane. - I don't support you anymore. - It's me who doesn't support you any more. So. Nothing works with you. Christ, i'mve had enough! I was dribbling and she threw a marble so I'd slip on it. Give me a break! - Is that true, Anya? - No! This is all an act. He slipped. - Filthy liar! - Fabien, don't insult Anya please. All right? Anya, you and the friends you play with have to be more careful. The playground is big enough for everyone. - Is this a joke? - Their ball's always coming our way. But if a single marble goes on their area, it's a big drama! - Calm down, Anya. It's true the playground has a problem of space allocation. That frustrates them, understandably. It's like forcing Serena Williams to play in the service box. She couldn't. It's the same for them. They get fed up— - Thank you, Vincent. Let me handle this. You will both make peace. And show some respect for each other. All right? - That's all? - What do you mean? - She's getting away with it? That doesn't make sense! - Fabien, you were told to make peace. So you make peace. That's all. - Are you in love with her? - Sorry? - You're always around her. What's that about? - Fabien— - This is ridiculous. We've said what had to be said. That's it. - It's still serious, though. - No what's serious is that you don't understand where the limits are. - We're going to buy him a dictionary. - Go on. You two, go back to your classes. - No punishment? - Shut up! We told you: "Back to your class". Shut up? - That's okay. You say that all the time. No. "Shut up", don't you say it? - No, no. I don't say "shut up", I don't say that to children. - No, I don't say that. - You never said: "Shut up" to Jade or—? - No. No. - When you were finished, you said "shut up" to— - to colleagues, to Guillard, I occasionally say I really can't take any more. For sure. But I don't go beyond my role. I'm the Head, I don't insult the children. If I was theHead, I would go— - you're not the Head. Please remember your place. - I'm with them all the time. - Fine, okay, take over my job. - I'm not hiding in an office. - Why the sarcastic laugh? - Because my job seems to be hiding in an office, yes? That's it? Are you trying to teach me my job? - No. Of course I'm not. - Yes that's exactly what you're doing. - But about how to manage children, then yes. - You confuse everything— - Do you know what we're going—? - Shut up. Serena Williams! I don't know where I am, what I'm talking about. I don't know what I'm saying, but it's true, I can't stand it any more. Fries, chicken—do you like water? - I like pretty much everything except vegetables. - Tell us what you like. - Yes, otherwise it'll take an hour. - Nathan, do you want some water? - Yeah, thanks. How's your elbow? - I faked it so they'd have to get rid of their marbles. - Oh give us a break! - When there's a problem, the Head doesn't give a shit. Unbelievable. - Didn't you say anything? - What do you think? Of course I didn't, Vincent is on the girls' side. - He's not a real mate. - We don't care. The priority's to find a solution. - Nathan, talk to your mother. - Yeah. - No, I don't like talking to her about school. - We don't care. This is too important. - Maybe there are other solutions? - No. - I've got one. We shoot the ball into their marbles. Every recess. - No no, that's too violent. - Too violent? You? - Hang on, I've an idea. We could say they're our team substitutes. They'll think they're getting to play but they won't. - That sucks! - A girl's idea. - It's a shit idea. - Okay fine. Never satisfied. - It's only since that stranger arrived that everything's gone wrong. Seriously. - I really hate these girls. Morons. - And what about me? - You're different. - Romy's the best. - You 're the queen of the school as far as the girls are concerned. What, you upset? We offending you? - No, it's nothing. - Wait, are you upset now? - Can't you guess? Yes I am. - So be upset, we don't care. - You want compliments? That's a compliment, but you take it the wrong way. Different? that's a compliment? - You don't have such a short fuse. - You shouldn't say that. - That was supposed to be a compliment! - Do you like Anya or not? - Shut your mouth. Button it. Slowly slowly! It's raining, you're going to slip. Slowly. - My marbles! - What's going on? Where are my marbles! - Calm down, Nils, we'll find them. - Nils, what's going on? What's going on, Nils? - My marbles are gone. - Don't panic, don't panic. Ok? Wait, wait. Nils. Don't panic. Ok? Calm down? Breathe. Do you have your meds? - Yes. - Ok. Breathe. Have your marbles gone? - Yes. - Don't worry, they can't have disappeared. We'll find them ok? We'll look for them and we'll find them. It'll be ok. Where did you put them? - There. What you looking at me for? - Enzo! - It's got to be the footballers. We get on their nerves. - No accusations without evidence. - Who else could it be? - You're accusing us—maybe it was you. - That's enough now. - Be quiet, please. - Search their stuff. - Anya, Anya, it's not your job to decide. - Search me, I've nothing to hide. Stop! - Who do you think you are? Are you going to calm down? - Me? - Stop! - I have values. I'm not a thief! - You have to do something! - Now let's all think about it. OK? And tomorrow— - it's not our fault. - Tomorrow, the thief who took the marbles, will put them back where he found them. OK? - Why he,? Maybe it's a girl. - It's Jade. - Why me? Stop! - Wait, wait! Let's all listen to the Head's proposal. He or she, indeed, who stole the marbles brings them back. After that, it's over, end of story. - They'll never bring them back! - Anya! - You're on their side. - Sorry? - Nathan plays football. - That makes no difference to me, you know. - That's true, it's possible you allow yourself to be influenced. Come on now, that's it, it's all over. - Stop! From now on, until you're able to communicate without shouting: Fine! No marbles. No football in the playground. Until the day comes when you learn how to talk to each other with respect. Never! - What about my marbles? - Later. - Who cares about your marbles! Arselicker! - But— - calm down! Be quiet now, please. Please! - I'm on Nils' side, he lost his marbles. He's upset. - You're a traitor! - Enzo! - Is this a joke? We don't give a fuck! - Shut your mouth! If I want to take Nils' side, I will. Please. The responsibility for this is yours. Be clear about this: If the marbles come back, it's all over. We want to be in your group. - We're tired of boys. Now that we can't play, it's useless. - We have to get together. This is unbearable. Sorry for not being very nice. We 'll make it up to you. - We can get Enola to join, and Kyliana and Cyrielle. - We can ask Vincent. - No, he won't do anything. - We could try to convince him. - Have you made up your mind? Are you going to ask her? - I don't know. - You really have to say yes. - It's not complicated. - You go down the hall and when she passes by you ask her for the ball. - Actually, it's very simple. Either you ask for the ball, or we're no longer your friends. Your choice. As long as we have the ball, that's fine with us. - Your mum's annoying. Whenever there's an issue, she takes the ball. - How're you doing, boys? - Fine, you? - You mind? Good good. What's up with Romy? - She's weird. She's really weird. - What? - Since that business with the marbles— - Is there any news? About the marbles? - No. - No. Anyway, we're innocent. - I didn't say anything. Why innocent? No-one's accusing you. - I saw you coming. - You're wrong. - We all saw you coming. - No, you're wrong. - No. We're not wrong. - As soon as there's a problem, it's always our fault. All of us. - Coincidence. - Sometimes it— Sometimes it's justified. - What d'you mean by that? - Causing trouble, upsetting the new kids, monopolizing the playground— - Did we throw the marbles? - Who was talking about marbles? Hold on— Stop! What're you doing? Stop! Don't go through my stuff! Stop! Stop. - Don't touch me! Thief! Let me go! Stop. Wait! What you do is beautiful. - Thanks. - Will you make me one? - Yes. - Is it a bracelet? - Can I try? What do I do? - My first name's short. - Shall we play the yes-no game? I'm good at it. Ask me questions. Starting in three, two, one— - your dog's name is Yuki? - Exactly. How old is she? - Nine months. - Nine months? - Sure? Nine months yesterday. I am 100% sure. - 100% sure? - 100%. Ok. Exactly 100%? - Exactly. - Ok, stop. - Hi girls. - Hi Nils. - What's she doing here? - Romy agreed to join our group. - Sorry? - Are you stupid or what? We don't like her. - Is there an explanation? What have I done? - Stop it, she's nice. - You never wanted to be our friend before, but now you do? - It's okay— - no, it's not okay. - There's no need a big deal out of it. - What do you want? - Listen, just go away. - Shut up, blondie, you bimbo. - She's nice! - You're jealous because I'm popular. - Popular, but with an evil heart. You don't want me because I'm prettier than you. - Whatever. Go away. - You're ugly! - You're friends with the boys. - So what? - Tomboy! - Tomboy? I prefer that to having your personality. - Go away, we don't want you. - C'mon, stop it— - you girls are mean. - Fine, we're mean. Piss off. - I'm not listening to you. - Bunch of ugly girls. - Go away! - I told you. You're a pest. - You're all heartless. - You fell on your head. - You're not nice. Wait for me! - Come back, Nils. We should have waited to see what Anya thinks. - No, she'd have agreed. Is there anyone there? I'm locked in! It's Anya! They locked me in! Help me! Help me! - Anya? - Anya? They've taken the handle! - We're looking! We're here. - Hurry up! - It's not here. - Open the door! - Go and get help. She's gone for help. I'm here. Breathe. - I'm scared. - Don't worry. No! Serious. I don't get what you're talking about. - Oh yes! - Great! She's a bulldozer. - You're useless, you can't even stop a ball. Look. You're here. She's next. Ok? Come on, you play, here. We're not here to have fun. - We don't care! - No! No more we don't care or you're out! Ok, send it to my head. You do this without touching me. Oh yeah, good. You enjoy being rubbish, do you? Think it's funny? - Calm down. - Stay focused! - Calm down. - You calm down. - You focus. What was that, Mummy's boy? - Piss off! - Your father abandoned you like a dog when you were born! Cross me again and you're screwed! - Don't listen to him. - He's weak. No mercy for the weak. - Are you going to calm down? - Let me go! - Enzo, stop. - Leave me alone! I'm not a prisoner? You're five years old, you and your useless dinosaurs. - Enzo, stop. Calm down. Ok? - Oh, he's annoying. - You are boring as hell, always shouting. - He's putting it on. - It's okay. Let it go. Leave him alone. - Shut your mouth! You! Are we here for fun or to play football? If you don't give a shit, you're out! - That's not for you to decide! Look in front of you. Cross me again and I'll rip you apart. Ok? Skinny little shit. Dirty little nobody. Come on, crawl like a piece of shit! - Enzo! Eat the grass like a dog. - Stop it! - Like a dog! - Enzo, stop it! - Like a dog! - Enzo, stop it. You, calm down! - Leave him alone. Leave him. - You shut up! - You pick on the weak. You have no mercy. - He looks like nobody. Not even his mother. Hello,Fabien. All right? - What are you doing here? - And you? What are you doing here? - Waiting for my father. - How about playing with us? Stay where you are. - Who locked me in the toilets? - What are you doing? - Who was it! - I don't know! - Liar. Who was it? They're going too far. - Don't worry, he deserves it. - Leave me alone! - Who was it? - I don't know. - Liar! Who was it? Nathan? - I don't know! My t-shirt, bunch of idiots! - Was Nathan there? Was Nathan there? - No, not Nathan. - Then who? - There was— Enzo, Selim and me. - Not Nathan, are you sure? - He wasn't there. - Quick, someone's coming! Quick! - My father'll kill you! Run, you bunch of bitches! My dad does bodybuilding! He'll really fuck you over! There's no issue about our kids. They didn't do anything. - I'm not going to let this pass. We don't have a solution. But they have to find one. There's too much violence. You have to tell them. I agree. - This mustn't happen again. Please! Thank you! Please! Thank you. We heard your remarks, and we're here to reassure you. The school's first objective is to find solutions. As for the incident involving Fabien Simonet. First of all, let me remind you it's only childish bickering— - it wasn't just bickering, you should've seen the state he came home in! - It happened at the weekend outside school. So nobody is on trial. We're not here to prosecute anyone. We're here to teach them to live together. That's what the school's all about. - You need to learn that living together is not for everyone. - It's not what everyone wants. - I don't know what you mean. So— what did that mean? - If it was your son we wouldn't be here. - It's a minority who ruin everyone's life. - There's no minority who ruin everyone's life. - Yes there is, madame. - You have to take a step back. Step back and place your trust in us. We know situations like this, and how to deal with them. - Are you going ahead with the school trip? - Yes. It's going ahead, especially now. - Sorry? - It's essential— - You're going ahead? With this atmosphere among the pupils? It's explosive! - If there was any danger— - What danger are we talking about? - So we aren't here to put anyone on trial, The aim of the school is, I say again, to teach them how to live together. How to live together. The trip must take place. The trouble-making elements, one girl especially— - Who are you talking about here? - You know exactly who I'm talking about. - We don't know what the problem is. My daughter has nothing to do with it. - What do you want? - What do you want, Robert Hue? You're giving me a headache. Don't talk to my wife like that! - What, you fat pig? - Let me focus on you. - Nobody's focusing on anybody! - Such refinement! - Arrange an educational trip for parents. - Go and clean up your daughter's education! - Please! - Fat pig. - Please, no insults. We aren't in a boxing ring, thank you! We are used to dealing with these issues. All we ask is for you to trust us. - Just fix it. What happened at school? - Nothing, it's fine. - What about the other pupils? - I told you. - We omly ask because we don't know. We're not going to yell at you. - I got bullied, so I defended myself a bit. That's it. - You were bullied? - I was locked inside the toilets. - What? Who were you with? - Who locked you in? - I was alone and someone locked me in. - Were you in there for long? In the toilet? - Yes, my friends got me out. - You were by yourself? - Yes. But it's fine. - All this will be over soon. - Are you going to separate? - No, not at all. We'll certainly move from here. - What? - Same as before. We'll choose a destination and settle there. - We can't afford to live in France. It's too expensive. People are stressed. - We don't spend time together any more. - No, we'll be better off elsewhere. - Before, we were free. Your mother isn't doing well. I don't like my job. - I'm not leaving. You only ever think of yourselves! - Anya! We're like little puppets, with a string like this, holding us up, and one at each shoulder making us do this— then we relax. Once again. And we relax. Shoulders. Elbows. Wrists. And relax. Excellent. Now you should all7 be ready to sing. Remember? - Roughly. Anya,you—you can just listen. Girls first. ♪ Walking alone, forward ♪ ♪ into the forest ♪ ♪ I sleep in lava ♪ ♪ I often forget. I never smile. ♪ - Great. Boys? ♪ Walking alone, forward ♪ ♪ into the forest ♪ ♪ outside, I can feel the storm. ♪ ♪ Life is waiting for me. I will catch it up. ♪ - Very good, all together now, the chorus— - No, it's finished. We don't want to do it. - Not with them. - Don't all talk at once! What's the problem? We don't want to sing with them. - Neither do we. No, we don't want to. - No, no, no. - It's impossible, Madame, we won't do it. - What on earth's going on? - We don't want to sing with the boys. - And we don't want to sing with them! - Madame? Madame? - Yes, Nils? - Maybe if you start singing, then we'll join in? - That won't make you sing. If I sing alone you don't sing. - We'll sing if you do. Maybe. We don't guarantee it. - This is blackmail. Go on, please, you sing very well. - We'll do it so you can memorize it. Let's see. OK. ♪ At night I leave ♪ ♪ I lie when I shout ♪ ♪ I write without regret ♪ ♪ the last night ♪ ♪ it's night in the forest ♪ ♪ you feel the gun ♪ ♪ suddenly you're reborn ♪ ♪ from the last rain. ♪ All right— Why do you want to talk to me? - I thought maybe we could play together again. - Yeah, maybe. - I'm sick of all this crap. - What crap? - Arguments. - Me too. But you started it. - No, it was you lot. - Who cares. Good. We really shouldn't tell the others. - They wouldn't understand. I'll miss you. You'll miss me? You hide them. - Don't eat too many sweets. - Don't worry. That bag of sweets will be empty before they get there. My heart? Go on. It'll be alright. Ok? Close your jacket, Enzo. - Don't! - It's not warm enough, you'll make yourself ill. - You're pissing me off. - No bad words! I've told you a hundred times. - No, really, you are. - Come and give me a hug. Come on, I'm entitled to a hug. - Yes, but you're still pissing me off. - Stop your swearing! - He's a bit stressed. - No, he'll be fine. Last year went well. You didn't stress out last year, you were fine. - The pills do that as well— - Did you give them to us? - Yes, it's done. - And some extra pills? Well, there we go. - It'd be a shame to go on a school trip to play football. You'll have a ball I suppose, but the goal is to do something else, to explore the forest. - You'll like it, big boy. - Fingers crossed. - If that's for me, don't cross anything, I don't want to stay with them. - OK. - I don't want to have anything to do with them any more. - There's a lot of size difference. Looks like they're all different ages. - That's true. - You're quite tall, actually. I thought you were going to be a little squirt, like that. I'm tall, though. - All right, Anya? - Yeah. - Ready to go? Can you introduce me to your brother? - My brother? This is my father! - Oh? You're so young! Sorry, sorry. - Thanks. That's a compliment. - There are other parents who are—older. - Are you going with the children? - No, I can't. I have another job waiting for me in Paris. I have to go. - He's a model. - A model? - Yes, I have a casting. Why are you laughing? - I'm not laughing. Sorry, I didn't know it was a job. - Ah ok. What do you do? - Cargo handling. - Give me your number, I'll give it to people in modelling. - Do you want to do this? - No I— - You're good-looking, so you have a chance. It's true. You don't think so? - Yes, yes. I've never thought about it, but I will now. - Why are you laughing? - I'm not laughing. - You are! - I'm not laughing. - He's not laughing? - "Haha, I'm not laughing!" - Hurrah for the coach! - When I'm not here, always problems. Whenever I'm here the coach is on time. - Thanks for being late. - Traffic. - There's traffic in my head. Go on. Hugs, Zoé. You'll miss me? - Come on, let's go. Girls at the back! - Yeah! - Can you keep me a seat? I'm here, okay? - Hold on— - Can I sit there? - Yeah, go ahead. - How about we go camping? - Fantastic! - Goodbye. - Alexine! Good luck with them. Success for both of us. - Sure. Well, you never do that to me. - No. Go on a little diet. Come on. Is there a problem there? - Madame? Why are the girls at the back? - We said for now girls at the back, boys at the front, and on the way back we'll see. Why on the way back? Enzo. Fasten your seat belt now. - But, Madame— - I have a sore throat. - Take some honey. - Quite frankly, at some point, this insolence has to stop. - They want our place. - Well done. Don't make me shout. Bye mum! Bye dad! What are you looking at me for? - Shut your mouth, buddy. Layabout. Why attack us? What have we done to you? - Druggie. - I swear I'm going to destroy you. - Madame Michelin, call him off - I'm telling you, I'm going to crush you. - Calm down. Don't look at him. That's what he wants you to do. - I'm going to fucking kill him. - Did you forget your steroids fix? - Fucking moron. - Why are you going on? Have you been told something? - No. Good riddance! I put a parachute in your bag! What are you doing all alone? Don't move, there's a wasp. - It's okay. - Wait, wait. Behind you. - Don't move. - It's not funny. - Don't move, there's a wasp. It's okay, it's gone. All good, it's fine. Romy, it was a joke to make you smile again. - A joke? There was no wasp. Are you okay? - It's not funny. - She's spraying, but at least she's smiling. On the other hand, you spit. Smile again without spluttering. - You must eat properly, you know? Then I won't be hungry any more. As for him— What a jerk. Look at how they eat. They disgust me. - They eat like animals. To go out with them we'd need to be blind and— - and have a blocked nose. - They're just kids. - Who d'you think's the ugliest? Enzo or Fabien? - Or Selim? - Even worse. They're all three of them ugly. - What about Lucas? - All three? Only three? - We picked out these three. All the boys in the class. My friends in other schools, they have boys that are super nice and super cute. - We're really unlucky. - So—what am I then? - You're different. You've got a brain, unlike them. - Yeah. - You don't play football. - You don't stink for miles around. - How could anyone fall in love with a boy in this class? Good morning. - Good morning. - My name is Dimitri. I'm visually impaired. I've worked here for 27 years. I work with wicker. In basketry, there are two materials, wicker and rattan. Wicker, is willow cut before maturity, before it becomes a tree. We put them in bundles. After that we make it into "white", or "raw", or "buffalo". "White" is what's left after we strip the bark. "Raw" is with the bark still in place. And for "buffalo", we soak it to make it orangey. All the material is soaked to soften it. You'd better explain yourself, traitor. - What are you talking about? - Stop playing the innocent. You know. - No, I don't? - Let me refresh your memory. - Stop it! Why are you hanging around that kangaroo? Clown! arselicker! She's using you to get friends! - Don't! - Why did you do that? You want me to kill you? Dirty fucker! Get out! - Jealous bastard. - Me, jealous of you? That's bullshit! The best! - Stop it. - You shut up! And you, fuck off. I've had enough. We need to find a solution. We have to make him pay! Not a word! Otherwise, you're dead. - Ah! No, no, no! It's too good. - They're good. I distracted you. We're making good progress there. - Yeah. Girls, are you okay? - Yeah. - Give me a chocolate? - Which one? - Naughty girl! Come in. - It's open! - Come in. - Enzo and Nathan almost got into a fight. Enzo fell. What? - They were close to fighting. Enzo says you're in love with Nathan. And something else. They're going to attack you tonight. - Attack us? - What? - He's dangerous! - He's crazy! We're not going to let it go. - Yeah. I told you he's dangerous. - I haven't told you anything. - Don't worry. Thanks for telling us. - Thanks, Nils. - I'm off before they suspect something. - Yes. - Thank you, Nils. Is it true? - I swear, I was going to tell you. Why are you ignoring me? I was going to tell you. I couldn't find the right occasion, sorry. - You have to choose. Which side are you on? - Both. - That's not possible. It's him or us. Three, two, one. Go! - Stop it! - Thanks. - Let me go! Stop! - Shut your mouth. - Shush, you'll wake Mummy. - Help! - Quick, the bed! Push the bed. Open the door! Hurry up. - Come back! Help! Let's go. Have a good night! Help me! - Nathan, are you OK? - Open it! - I can't. Turn off the light. Attack! Are you OK, Nils? - I just didn't feel well. Nathan's stuck in the wardrobe. - What? Go and get help. Go! Are you all right, Nathan? - Yeah. - We have to go. - Where? - Far away in the forest. They all hate us. - You want to run away? - Yes. - No, I can't do that. - We won't see each other again. - Why do you say that? - I'm going. Please come with me. Come. - No. - You don't love me? - Yes I do, but that's not the problem. Anya, wait! Wait, hold on! No! It's dangerous out there! it's cold! Anya! You don't touch Nils! - You've such a big head! You think everybody loves you? - Stop! - I love you. - Let me go! Let me go! - I said I love you! So stop pretending. - Don't touch me! - She doesn't love you! - You pervert! Don't touch me again! I don't believe it. What's all this noise! Stop! Have you gone mad? Stop this right now! Boys, back to your room! - They punched me in the nose. - Get to your rooms! Nils, with all your heart problems, bravo. What's happening? - What the hell are they up to now? - What are you doing? What's all this about? What did we say? This is serious. Ah yes, Nils. Congrats The boys started it all. This shouldn't happen. - It's always the boys. Stop, be quiet. One— Good night. - It's fine! But—where's Anya? Do you know? - I don't know. - Where's Anya? I'm going to look for her. You have one minute to turn off the light. - We didn't do anything. - You never do anything. - It's okay, you always yell at us. We get attacked in our sleep— - Good night. - And that's our fault. It's not funny! Thanks, Romy. - Don't worry, that's normal. You saved us. - Thanks. - I have something to say. Can't Romy be in the group? She can take my place. - I want her in, she saved us. - Thank you. - We accept you into our group. - Thanks! If I said nasty things, I didn't mean to. - Neither did we. You saved us. Enzo would have punched me. Sorry for the "tomboy". - No, don't worry— - Did you see Enzo? The guy's a psychopath. - What did he do? - He wanted to kiss me! We're calling your parents! We'll see about that tomorrow! Anya's missing among the girls. I've searched everywhere. - You sure? - Everywhere. - It's not possible. Maybe it's because we ignored her— that she's gone. - Maybe she's dead. - No. - Don't say things like that. - Don't think like that, be positive. Stay positive. - You all right? - It's all because of me. - No, it's got nothing to do with you. - If I hadn't stolen your marbles, everything would be fine. - What? - Sorry. - The parents and the police are here. - Ok. Children, please go back—back to your rooms, and try to sleep. Ok? - We can't sleep without her. - How can we sleep knowing she's gone? - I do understand. Let the grown-ups handle the situation, and don't worry. Get off to bed. - You're trying to reassure us. - Yes, but it is reassuring. Go on, back to your rooms quietly. Thank you, good night everyone. We'll keep you informed, I promise. You'll be first to know if there's any news. In their place, I wouldn't be sleepy either. Don't worry. We'll find her. Anya! Anya, it's Dad! Dad! Dad, I'm here! Anya! I'm here! - Come here, darling.
