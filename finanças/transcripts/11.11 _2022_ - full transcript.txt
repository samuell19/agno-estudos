Our life is full of numbers. Dates of birth and phone numbers, license plate numbers, or even specific times. Some think numbers are meaningless, others are convinced that they're cosmic messages. Details and signs show them that they're going in the right direction. But each direction we take, whether it's right or wrong, affects us and many others. Every detail of our life, no matter how small, may prevent us from evil, or get us involved in it. Some will think it's a message, others will think it is just a coincidence. What an inappropriate way to park your car. I was blamed for it. You should've left the key. Alia, why didn't you tell me about seeing Dr. Eyad again? Sorry, Tarek. I'll call you after I'm done. Where should I park the car? Rest, Mr. Youssef, the nurse will call your name shortly. Okay. - Good evening. - Good evening. I have an appointment with Dr. Eyad. - Your phone number? - 0100755... Dr. Hisham Eissa has to go to... Mrs. Alia Almerghany, Doctor Eyad. Mrs. Alia, rest at the reception. Doctor Eyad's nurse will call you shortly. Okay. I'll go buy something, In case it's my turn and I'm not here. - Okay. - Thanks. I've an appointment with Dr. Eyad. NADA 11:00 P.M. THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 11TH. - Aren't you ready yet? - I'm almost done. - Where are my cigarettes? - On the table. Didn't we agree not to smoke in bedroom? Too stubborn! That's why you love me. Seriously, why did you love me? You always have these strange thoughts. - Answer the question. - The man sleeps and the woman thinks. Even married people? What about them? When the man sleeps, the woman thinks? Which question should I answer now? The first one, why did you love me? I love you for a long time, since college. I forgot why. I didn't ask you when, I ask you why. I've loved you for your silence. A typical woman can't be silent. What else? How greedy! She hung up. We should go back to the office. HEND, YOU DIDN'T WANT TO... CALLING LAYLA, PHONE: 01222277610 WHY DO YOU INSIST ON COMPLICATING IT? DO YOU THINK I WOULD'VE PUT YOU IN THIS SITUATION? If it's not in your car or at Lounge Café, it definitely had been stolen. I'll check with Yasser. - Looking for this? - What is this? Where did you find it? You mean whom I found it with. Can we sit and have a drink? I will tell you, and talk a little. I don't want to be late, Radi. Aren't we finished talking? Let's spend some time, as if you're still looking for it. Total is 85 EGP. Won't you move your car? If you talked to her again, we'll look bad. I'll wait for you on the balcony. What's going on? Good evening. A croissant and a latte, total cost is 66 EGP. Tarek, please leave me alone. How can I leave you alone, Alia? You never take these injections alone. Leave me alone and close the door behind you. Leave me, Tarek. Everything will be okay. It will work this time. This is a test from God. Who could handle it, Tarek? I'm mentally and psychologically exhausted. It's okay. It's okay, my love. Everything will be okay. Have a little patience. I no longer know who needs to be patient, me or you? Me and you. Both of us. Alia... We have to try again and again. This is the fifth time! The fifth time, Tarek. Don't worry. Please don't jump the gun. Only God knows what will happen next. - Wish her speedy recovery. - Thanks. The doctor is coming now. I'm cold, Tarek. I want to leave. Wait, you're still on drugs, honey. - No, I want to go home. - Wait a minute for me. Mrs. Alia, I can't agree that you make IVF for the sixth time. But as far as we know, many people do it up to ten times. I have patients who get pregnant after the 15th or 16th time. But each case is different. Age isn't in your favor. In your case, injecting hormones may cause clots or a heart attack. It's not easy. Listen, the success percentage is less than ten percent. And as I told you, manipulate hormones is dangerous for you. We'll start the new cycle six weeks later anyway. Think well and make up your mind. And we'll repeat the tests from the start... Do you think this is the solution? I know how much you want us to have kids, you must be thinking of leaving me. Don't I have the right to be a father, Alia? Even if you know it'd break me? Admit that you deprived me of this right, when you decided not to have kids until after four years of marriage. How are you, Hassoun? Put this inside. - Tito, I missed you. - How are you, and my aunt? - How are you, Alia? Fine. - Good. Do you check on your aunt before your mom? She is like a mother to me too. - How are you, my dear? - I'm fine, hope you are. - I'm Fine. - How are you, Alia? Come kiss me. How are you doing? I'm fine, my dear. - Hurry up and wash your hands. - Okay. Alia, come with me to the kitchen. Let's set the table. Come on. - Welcome, dear. - How are you? I'm fine as long as you both are fine. Hope that you be blessed with having kids soon. - God willing. - Come on. Alia, put this on the table. Come with me to tell them what you're saying. What's up? What are you arguing about? Your son claims that I rushed the divorce decision. How could you say that, son? He made her suffer! Come on, before the food gets cold. Come on, Alia. Thanks, mom. Molokhia is delicious. I asked your wife to come to teach her the recipe but she didn't. Forgive me, as you know I'm busy with work. It's okay, It's even better, so we can eat it here every time. Tell me, what are we going to do about work? - I'm so excited. - What work? - Hala wants to work with me. - And what are you going to do? Director Producer. Hey, no need to talk about work while we eat. Give me some potato before your son finishes it. You wouldn't be the same now. It certainly won't work again. Didn't I tell you not to marry a woman older than you? You would have got a son his age now. This is not due to her age. - Age difference between us isn't big. - No, you're wrong. Mrs. Noha asked to change the floor and doors colors and I don't know... She has always used her work as an excuse, and now what I was afraid of has happened. Sorry, Tarek, I don't mean to intrude. But it's really hard for a woman over 40 to have kids. Unless she's given birth before. Can we end this now? GERMAN HOSPITAL - WE REMIND YOU OF YOUR APPOINTMENT WITH DR. EYAD Do you have money? - Yes. Do you need some? - No. I want sesame pastries. Take this, buy me pastries, and sweets for yourself, and don't waste all the money. Absolutely not, am I a fool to do that? Fine. I swear, if you ever get close to Mai again, I will hang you naked in the street. What's wrong, man? Alia, why didn't you tell me about seeing Dr. Eyad again? Sorry, Tarek. I'll call you after I'm done. NADA 11:00 P.M. THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 11TH. Oh God! Wait a minute! How does my client pay two million in compensation after a year of work? Mr. Said, we reduced the value of compensation after agreement... These things are done by pressure, not agreement, Mr. counselor. We're not used to this method, Mr. Said. Because you follow an old style. Forget about my late father-in-law, Look at me. I have the final decision. Our client's situation is weak. It's important to minimize the casualty. And we have nothing to impose our conditions. I will erase this sum of reconciliation, and consider it not exists. Get out, until I know what to do! Get out. Mrs. Nada, wait. I need you. - Don't object to what I say. - What's wrong with you? Nothing. As you see, their thinking is old. Awful. Nermin. - What? - Nermin. - Hello. - What is this? Come here! What a pleasant surprise? Hello, my love, come on in. You can go Ms. Nada. - Let's continue our conversation later. - Let her stay. I came today to organize our time, the three of us. To keep doing what you're doing. No, sweetheart, we're done. Go, Ms. Nada. - Excuse me. - Don't move. Said, I asked you specifically today to pick up your son and you forgot. They called you many times and you didn't answer. I had to leave the event to pick him up myself. I'm sorry honey, I forgot. We were late in court. Court until 8:00 pm? And then what? My love, you need to organize your time considering your wife and your son's sake. It's very simple. Karim's training on Sundays, Tuesdays and Thursdays. You two can have sex on Mondays and Wednesdays. It is preferable to spend the weekend with family. I forgot. It is also better if you don't use our old flat, or change the bed. You two are disgusting. What are you doing, Said? - I don't know. - Go after her! Nermin. Nermin. Nermin, stop it. Don't make a scene. Make a scene? I didn't raise my voice. No, but the bullshit you said... Bullshit? You're a liar! This is not true. You are delusional. You're not only a liar, but also a coward. - Don't cross the line. - You are the one who is doing that. You must learn not to cross the line. - Excuse me. - No, you shouldn't be driving. - I'll drive you home. - I'll go. Let go of me! - Step away! - I can't let a catastrophe occur. The catastrophe is already occurred. Rest, Mr. Youssef. The nurse will call your name immediately. - Good evening. - Good evening. - You go first. - Thanks a lot, I don't want to delay you. It's Okay. Wish you speedy recovery. I have an appointment with Dr. Eyad. - Your phone number? - 011515... Where are you, Said? Why don't you answer me? Where are you? Mrs. Alia, rest. Doctor Eyad's nurse will call you shortly. Okay. I'll buy something, In case it's my turn and I'm not here. - Okay. - Thanks. You caused the damage and ran away! WHY DO YOU INSIST ON COMPLICATING IT? DO YOU THINK I WOULD'VE PUT YOU IN THIS SITUATION? Buy a rose. I hope you marry her. Later, Walaa. If it's not in your car or at Lounge Café, it definitely had been stolen. I'll check with Yasser. - Looking for this? - What is this? Where did you find it? You mean whom I found it with. Can we sit and have a drink? I'll tell you, and talk a little. I don't want to be late, Radi. Aren't we finished talking? Let's spend some time, as if you're still looking for it. Absolutely not. If you talked to her again, we'll look bad. Do you get it? I'll wait on the balcony. Sir... Total is 85 EGP. - Good evening. - Good evening. Won't you move your car? - Cocoa with milk. - Do you want an extra flavor? No, thanks. A croissant and a latte, total cost is 66 EGP. I want to understand your problem. - I won't leave my father, Mai. - Did I ask you to, Radi? I want you to arrange your life, this is very important for your future. My future! I'm serious, Radi. Do you want to have a notable position in society? Or you want to spend the rest of your life a seller? Fine. What do you mean? Wait, Radi. I don't mean to bother you... This is enough, Mai. I'll think about my future, then we'll talk later. Yes, Layla. Kiss your father's hand. Come on, take your stuff. - Karam. - What? - "What"? You must respond with yes. - Yes? Wear it. Take care of your brother and don't make troubles. - We must cut your hair when you're back. - Okay. Come on. Come on. - Walk side by side. - All right. - And walk on the sidewalk. - Okay. We'll move in a few seconds. I'll get the key. Go to your collage, son. I'll walk to the Kiosk to open it myself. We'll walk together, it's next to the collage. - Good. Come on. May God help us. - Fine. Come on, Radi. You'll be late for college, Mr. engineer. I'm done, dad. I'm the cruel one? He left me and gone. Surely, he would. Don't you see what he does for his father? And what did I say about this? I want him to arrange his life. Dr. Abdulhadi offered him many times to train in his office. He refuses. As he spends mornings at college and nights in the kiosk. When he'll train? Take it easy on him, He's a real gentleman. This is rare these days. I know this very well. He is, and I love him, but what should I do? It is not my decision alone. What do I say to my father, mother, family, and other people? He's an engineer, works in a kiosk. Okay. Finish your meal, we have lectures. I don't know what I'd do without you, Radi. As we agreed, I'll stay until I find a job and then hire someone else. Hiring someone else? Won't this person get paid? You have to put your family first. Don't worry. I'll take care of everything. Layla, never talk to me about this again, seriously. Yes, mom. Listen, I'm going to lectures. No, I'm at college. No, I'm about to leave. Well, goodbye. How are you, Mai? Come spend a little evening with us... What are you doing? Step away. - Calm down, Mai. Sorry. - Stop it, Mando. Excuse me. I'm sorry, excuse me, Mai. This is me, not mom, Layla. The tracking app shows that my phone at Lounge Café. How come? I don't know. I only remember calling mom after leaving you. Come with me to look for it. What about Radi? No, I don't want to talk to him at all. Well then, I'll go find it myself. Fine. Goodbye. Take this, buy me pastries, and sweets for yourself, and don't waste all the money. - Absolutely not, am I a fool to do that? - Fine. Thanks. Red box. Radi, I took a Pepsi and I want hairspray. - How much? - Ten pounds. Okay. How much? What's wrong, Mr. engineer? What is this? What's wrong with this boy? What do you want? Give me this phone. Give me... I swear, if you ever get close to Mai again, - I will hang you naked in the street. - What's wrong? It's all right, Mr. Hejazy. Alright, Radi. CALLING LAYLA, PHONE: 01222277610 Alia, why didn't you tell me about seeing Dr. Eyad again? Sorry, Tarek. I'll call you after I'm done. Slow down, Nermin. The boy is scared. Who is scared? Him or you? Why would I? I didn't do anything. You insist on embarrassing yourself. I'll tell you, I saw her smoking by the window of my bedroom in our old house. But I wasn't surprised, I already knew. I've known for a long time and I didn't say anything. Why didn't you keep silence and pretending that you don't know? Because I'm bored. I'm done. You're done or is my contract expired? I thought you had a few feelings left. But no, you broke it out of boredom. I got bored too. I'm tired of a woman like you, fake and hollow. Can't love or hate me. - But I loved you. - And I loved you. Then what happened? We got married! Really? Careful, Nermin! - You go first. - Thanks a lot, I don't want to delay you. It's Okay. Wish you speedy recovery. - I have an appointment with Dr. Eyad. - Your phone number? - Thanks a lot. - Dr. Hesham Eissa... I have an appointment with Dr. Eyad. Where are you, Said? Why don't you answer me? Where are you? You caused the catastrophe and ran away! I swear I will take revenge on you, Said. If it's not in your car or at Lounge Café, it definitely had been stolen. Buy a rose. I hope you marry her. - Well, give me one, Walaa. - I told you! HOBZY Invite me to the wedding. I'll check it with Yasser. Absolutely not. If you talked to her again, we'll look bad. Do you get it? End the call, I'm on my way. - Looking for this? - What is this? - Where did you find it? - You mean whom I found it with. Can we sit down and have a drink? I will tell you, and talk a little. I don't want to be late, Radi. Aren't we finished talking? Let's spend some time, as if you're still looking for it. Okay. I'll wait for you on the balcony. What's going on? Total is 85 EGP. - Thanks. - Don't mention it. Won't you give me medicine? - I already did, darling. - All right, my dear. I swear to you, you won't find better than 12C. There's another similar unit but I don't recommend it. Well, see you on Thursday. I'll show you the master plan and you decide. Any time that suits you. Well, 11 p.m. is fine. I know Lounge Café. Well, see you there. I'll call to confirm the appointment. Goodbye. How are you, Fawzia? Hello, Dodo. Hello, my love. This woman doesn't give me medicine. - I'll make you dinner. - Okay, my love. - How are you, Mr. Ali? - Hi, Zayn. - Zayn without nicknames? - Yes. From whom did you inherit this disrespect? Listen... Hide it and don't tell your mom that I brought you something. Okay? So she doesn't scold us. How are you, beautiful Fawzia? Where did Zayn go? - I want to buy school supplies for him. - Wait a moment. I'm Zayn, my love. Your son. And this is Ali. Ali is my son. I'll go check on the woman inside. - What a beauty! - Thanks. No! - Please stand here and don't interfere. - Okay, sorry. - Have you had a good day? - Wasn't the best. I'll earn a very good profit if I sealed today's deal. And hire someone to help you. Please pray for me. God bless you, my love. But before hiring someone to help me, chop up the salad now. I don't like to cut tomatoes. - What did you cook for us today? - Same as yesterday, what do you think? - Was there no salad left from yesterday? - No kidding! Zozo hasn't left me all day until now. I also won't leave you even for a moment today. Stand there, you are punished. - Don't chop salad or anything. go. - Why are you treating me this way? Okay. Come on. - What happened, mom? - What happened? - Step away! - I was taking medicine and the cup broke. Why did you do this, mom? Why, darling? Sit down. Take this medicine away from her. Didn't I tell you not to put it in front of her? Hello, Doctor... Thank God, the doctor said everything is fine... Thank God. And we should keep the medicine out of her reach. All right. Go get Ali to sleep, I'll sit with her for a bit. - Okay. - Come on. - Zayn... - Yes, my love. I'll prepare the bathroom for you. I beg you! It's been a long time since we did that. - Don't be late. - All right, sweetheart. - Who is that you call her sweetheart? - Definitely you, sweetheart. No one more precious than you. She brought games and stuff... she brought... - a bag - a bag that has a goose and a duck says... Do you know the boy called Zayn... HEND Good morning, Dodo. Good morning. Sorry, I got busy with Zozo last night. I fell asleep unintentionally. Don't worry. Did she wake up? Yes, and I gave her medicine at 7 a.m. And hid the rest over the refrigerator. Good. I wanted to tell you something, but please don't be mad. I don't have time. I have a meeting now to attend. - Want me to buy something when I get back? - No, thank you. Tell me then. I thought... it's just an idea. You said you'd hire someone to help me, instead of hiring someone, and paying a lot of money for her, we will pay for her food as well. I thought we could with that money send your mother to a nursing home. They will look after her and give her medication on time. And so on. Didn't we discuss this before? And I asked you not to bring it up again, Hend? Come on, Ali. I made you great soup, Fawzia. Why did you leave the door open? Fawzia. Where did you go? Ali! Ali? Ali. Help me, Zayn. Your mother went out with Ali and I can't find them. I don't know! Please don't yell at me! I don't know what to do, I'm already out. I searched for them everywhere. - Mom. - Ali, wait! Ali, darling. Ali. How could you do this, Ali? Leaving me like this, Ali darling? Is this right? Don't do that again, got it? Where's your granny? She left me and gone. Where did she go? Zayn, I found Ali but I can't find your mom. Zayn, I found Ali but I can't find your mom. Are you idiot? What do you mean you lost my mom? Did I leave mom with a little girl? What's this tone, Zayn? She opened the door and went down, what can I do? You've been spending your time on Facebook and Instagram, browsing the dresses that you like! Forgetting about an old woman who can't even remember her name. Right. I do nothing all day but browse the phone! You forget that she couldn't do anything without me. I take good care of her, Zayn. She could've lost my son. Go home and I'll deal with it. - Have you seen my mom? - No. Has my mom passed by here, Hassan? Oh, God. Hello, uncle Yasser. Thanks God! Can you stay with her until I come? Where are you? I'll come now. Please stay with her, uncle Yasser. Thank God! Thank God! Mom! Why did you do this, Fawzia? I was worried about you, my love. I'm buying school clothes for Zayn. Okay. How about we buy it together? Let's go? All right. - Sorry, I bothered you. - Don't worry. Let's go, my love. Come on. Let's go. Can you not repeat this behavior? For my sake, Fawzia. For my sake. Hend. Dodo. Sit, my love. Hend. It is natural for me to be angry, madam. My wife tells me she lost my sick mother and can't find her. You must understand my situation. I won't put my mother in a nursing home! Wait a second, will you be okay if you are in the same situation? I don't know if it's your idea or Hend's. But frankly, it's an idea... That's why I told you that I wanted to speak to her. All right. I'll give her some space. Well, goodbye, madam. How are you, Zekas, sweetheart? - Fine, darling. Sorry for bothering you. - Not at all. Go talk to your wife and everything will be okay. And don't worry about Fawzia. I'll take care of her. - I'm sure darling. Thank you. - Goodbye. What do you not understand? I'm telling you I'm tired. And you know I did my best. But every person has a limit, And I can't stand it anymore. Not only did your mother become a danger to herself, but on my son too. Our son Ali, Zayn. Well, I understand you are tired. Does it comfort you putting my mom in a nursing home? I'll ask you a question. When you get older and get sick, would it be okay for you that Ali put you in a nursing home, Hend? Honey, she'll be safer there. Where she will receive a special care. This is the last time we'll talk about this, Hend. I won't put my mother in a nursing home. And the fact that I love you, doesn't mean I'll think, even for a second, to choose between you and my mom. You get what I mean? Listen, Zayn... I love you too and you know that very well. But my energy ran out. I did everything I could. Think about what you will do and tell me. I'll stay here until you make up your mind. Fine. Good. Bon Appétit, darling. Let's get your medicine. Come on. Come on. - Hello. - Hello, sweetheart. - How are you, Zekas? - I'm good, darling. How are you, Fawzia? Fawzia had dinner. I tidy up your room that was upside down. Now I'll make you eggs as you like them. - I don't want to bother you. - Don't mention it. I am like a mother to you, just like Fawzia. I miss you, Fawzia. Where is the other woman? She's gone. Where is Zayn? Zayn is studying, Mom. Isn't that what you've cared about? Well, I studied and succeeded. After you treated me like a soldier, that has to do everything correctly. But you only cared about people's talk. "I won't let people say I failed to raise you after your dad's death!" You forgot that you are my mother! You forgot I needed you, that I needed you to hold me as you're holding Ali now. Even though you think he's Zayn! You only knew how to say, "Study, Zayn!" "Do this, Zayn. Don't go, don't go out, don't be late, Zayn." Zayn is studying, mom. Zayn is studying. Where is Zayn? Hello, Mr. Ayman. How are you? No, our appointment is the same. 11 pm at Lounge Café. As it suits you. See you soon. Goodbye. I'm going out, Fawzia, do you want anything? I want sesame pastries. Where are you going? Won't you eat your dinner? Sorry. It's a meeting, I'll finish it and come back fast. Meeting at 10:30 pm? God help you! Do you have money? - Do you need some? - No. I want sesame pastries. Take this, buy me pastries, and sweets for yourself, and don't waste all the money. Absolutely not, am I a fool to do that? Fine. CITY STORE SALE 50% OFF Alia, why didn't you tell me about seeing Dr. Eyad again? Sorry, Tarek. I'll call you after I'm done. Where should I park the car? Go up to your room, Karim. What is this? I guess you won't need more clothes with her. Get out, Said. I'll leave you to come back to your senses. - Where are you going? - To bring a tuxedo. Won't take these! No, forget about that. You're out of your mind. - You are a crazy woman. - There's none like me! I just went crazy when I married you, - to enjoy what my father and I built. - God damn this life! God damn this life! You act like you take credit for me. I sweated blood to build all of this. I built all of this. Or did you not notice? I noticed very well. As I also noticed that I failed to make you a decent man. I am decent despite your nose. Do you know what did you fail? You failed to make me an improved version of your father. Who left you and returned to his old girlfriend. You made identical copy of him. I spent years exactly as you wanted. Right, well done! You even outdid him, and became even more despicable. You're back to your old girlfriend who dumped you ten years ago, - or have you forgotten? - It might be an act of respect. I reconnected with her, so I can deal with you. A man needs a second woman to be able to continue with his wife. - Right. - Yes. Woman, in turn, needs another man to leave her husband. And I want to leave you, Said. What do you mean? What do you mean, Nermin? Do you want to dump me for another man? Is there another man? You did all this for another man? All you did... I swear to God, I'll kill you! Who is he? Speak! Who is he? It doesn't matter. You did all this for him? There is no other man, Said. I was only completing your theory. Did it hurt you? Sorry. The truth hurts. The truth is that anyone else can take your place. It's enough for me that he won't be you! Tomorrow, you leave your cases to counselor Sami. And we'll get divorce, Said. And... Take Mrs. Nada with you, too. You've gone mad. Yes. All right. Well, I'm coming. I'll tell you everything when I come. Nada, I'm coming, I'll tell you... Where is the emergency? My son! - My son! - Doctor! Get out! All because of you! If it's not in your car or at Lounge Café, it definitely had been stolen. Buy a rose. I hope you marry her. - Well, give me one, Walaa. - I told you! Invite me to the wedding party. I'll check it with Yasser. If you talked to her again, we'll look bad. Did you get me? hang up, I'm on the way. - Looking for this? - What is this? Where did you find it? As if you're still looking for it. Okay. I will wait for you on the balcony. What's going on? Total is 85 EGP. Thank God. Nermin... I'm sorry, Nermin. I'm... Let him speak to me. Yes, Sir, I'm coming. I'm coming, Sir. Yeah. Shit! Shit! Shit! Nothing in our life happens by chance. Every coincidence is originally destiny. Each one of us has a story, and every story has endless questions, What do we do now? What brings us here at this exact moment? Why we met today? And not yesterday? Why we change our mind at the last minute? Many unanswered questions. Sorry, sir, for being late. Seems like someone threw a stone at the glass. Would you like anything else? Yes, I want to add a cold ham sandwich, without mayonnaise. - Well, the total becomes 120 EGP. - 120? Here you are. Could you stand in line please? Thanks. I can't believe you did all this for me. I can do anything for you, Mai. But I can't leave my father. Well then. But you must promise me you won't ignore it. - Deal? - Deal. And thanks for the rose. Did you see the man with his shirt covered in blood? - Where? - He was right here. Hend, I understand you're right, I know you are as worried about Ali as I am. That's what I was saying! You forced me to do that. Mom has no one but me, and I won't abandon her. Yes, Hend, this is my final decision. Goodbye. Our life changes in an instant. Between what we like, and what ruins our life... Hello, how are you? The strange thing is that each one of us thinks that he is drawing his own path. I love you too, Tarek. But as I told you, I think your cousin is more suitable for you. She'll make your dream and your family's come true. But the truth is that no one knows his fate. And the more we try to understand, we get lost. Yes, this is my final decision. But what we must understand, is that every choice has a price. We must be ready to bear the cost of our choices. NADA And don't forget that the fine line between life and death, might be drawn by the smallest of things. And might be erased by simplest things. And because we are all connected to one another, we don't feel the results of what we do until we've gone through it. Only then will we be sure that nothing happens by chance.
