A reliable source reported, a very large shipment... of ecstasy being sent to the country. The producer is located on the border near its location. Send an elite unit to intercept... before arriving in Thailand. Okay, my son. is a warrior! Hey... Fast fast! Let's go. Go, go, quick. Fast! Over there, over there! 407 call base, please respond. 407 call 502, please answer. 407 call base. 502 please respond. 502 please respond. 502... 502... What the hell are they doing? What should we do? Fighting in Yaowarat between the police and the pins of the ecstasy king... broke out after the attack by the police. Now an update of the story. Sir... Commander General... What are the details of the outbreak? What is the situation current, sir? No comments now. All information must be released by my office first. Can you give us some data? Run! Run! Run! Run! Wait! Wat! Wat! Wat! Wat! Wat! Wat! My son is the leader of the troop and I want him to help. And also for your trop! I'm sorry. That's not enough Your Honor. You're not listening! Tell Boonsak to pick up My son at the border... dead or alive. I will reconsider the question about which we speak. Lord, General, remember your son. Search the area. To move! Captain! What does that mean? Where's the support team? Did you know how many people die? The mission has an agreement. With what you agreed with those from outside? Where's the support team? Wing, Ong... Did you know that the northern divide cut our labor? I was exhausted like the rest of you. Wing, if you have no way out, stay with me here * IMPLACABLE HUNTING * Charge! Prepare! Fire! Civil unrest is mounting. More recently,the poor assembly... held a strike in front of to the House of Government... demanding solutions, for many problems. Statistics show, which government income... increased by 30% from, last year. Due to the so-called Crisis of "Tom Yum Goong"... and the devaluation, from thai baht... every Thai citizen is affected. As a result... General Chavalit Yongchaiyuth, the prime minister Parliament dissolved. The new government, led by Prime-Minister Chuan Leekpai... ensured that policy and economy of Thailand... would be better in the near future. Statistics and facts are totally different. Now, industries need to revive. Agriculture is outdated. The standard of living between, the people in the capital... and other provinces, is obviously patchy. The Chuan Leekpai government agreed to borrow... 580 billion baht from the Fund International Monetary... or the IMF to solve the economic crisis. After the failure, of the Government Chuan Leekpai... new elections were called. Thaksin Shinawatra, was elected prime minister. He promised to revive the all areas as soon as possible. He expects Thailand to pay its debt to the IMF within 2 years. So it seems that we are capable to pay the debt to the IMF. This is not only a political game. Please do not just think in the next election... because trade and politics, can not be merged. It is not possible that the country simply play money, in this problem, Chanchai. I know the figures well. Tax revenue and exports substantially increased this year. Hello! Yes, I have decided, sir. If the government insists in paying the debt to the IMF... while the situation economic is terrible... Please tell him I'll be ready. to help as much as you can. I will not leave my factory close again. I will not let them sell any government company. It is in the country's interest. If you want to shuffle the cards... All unions will support you. If we lose... You will lose too, General. Why did not we shuffle the cards? Payment should not happen. The government should announce his resignation. Are you sure we have the numbers in the cabinet... overthrow the government? They are all opening the way. Frankly speaking, the only The number I need is yours. Make sure that all the orders come from me. It's time for you return my favors. Your job is to convince Nawin to steal. And I'll have a great job for you later. Yes sir. What will you do? I can not take it anymore! I want money. I carried a gun all my life... I dont know how do nothing else. We abandon everything, our titles, names... and citizenship, and for what? I'm better dead than working at the border. Everything we did went to the country And what do we have to show for this? Are we heroes or beggars? Shit! Shut up! You're leaving me in the snow! With the! There may be nothing to eat tomorrow. Let's steal, right? Let's go! Lower the knife. Why did not you die? I'm warning you, put your knife down. Why did you come back? To look at a bitch like you. How could I raise our son? That's no excuse! My wife was a bitch! What the hell? I did it for huh? To your country, huh? We were dying of hunger here! Female dog! You want to kill me? Get out of me! Ong! Ong! Calm down! Leave me alone! To relax! To relax! To relax! Calm down! Here's some money. It is not much... but you can build on it. Think twice, Ong. At least you have a family. Take good care of them. Same? I'll do what you say. At where? When? A bank on Ratchada Road. When? The day after tomorrow. Pol, get us a car and get us some guns. What about the Ngo? We may not have to use explosives. Is it still tomorrow? No, I've changed my mind today! Come on. Delivery! The police have you surrounded! Freeze! Check your ammo. Breaking news! In this exact moment... the bank of the Ratchada Road is being stolen. The police arrested the thieves... inside the Ratchada tunnel. The thieves took a hostage Let's surrender! There's no way out! To relax! Think twice! There is no way out. Just surrender! I hear! I'll count to 10. Clear all cars and people, otherwise the hostage dies! I'm serious. Not! Like this? attack. No one moves until I give the signal. The hostage is in danger. We're going to die. No matter what happens, we should render. We have to surrender. Why surrender? Shooter ready? Not! Not! Fire! This just in. The police now has the situation under control. The hostage was unharmed... while three thieves were shot dead by the police. A thief survived the incident and is in police custody. Do you know why you survived? They want you to work for them. The record shows that they are all dead! There is a report that Nawin who was accused... with theft escaped. The escape happened while the prisoner was being transferred to prison. The police are looking for him. I was ordered to take you to the meeting point. Sir! Ong! How are you? What are you doing here, Song? There are many bombs, sir. Our country has lost a lot interest for foreigners. I do not think the government lends attention to our requests. Although we have men and firepower... violence can not solving the problems. But the economic failure in mass is likely. If the government pay the IMF. Let's start our plan. Nawin's here, sir. Send him in. Yes sir. Everything is ready. We just need word from the top... and my boys will jump at it. The government announced clearly... whereas payments they would continue. What are we waiting for? The forces of the general they are ready too. Captain. Go ahead as planned. Yes. Firefighters are extinguishing the fire in the Thai oil refinery... What is burning since last night. The official confirms that the fire... It was an accident it's not an act of terrorism Not yet. Prime Minister Taksin announced a press conference... on debt repayment of the IMF will be held... at some point in the next two days. Speculation is that Thailand be free of IMF debt. Everyone should understand the situation. There is a group of people who disagree... with the payment of the debt and manifested themselves. They are the likely culprits for behind the two recent attacks. Police found C-4 explosives. I think we should postpone payment for security reasons. We have no clue about the lack of the C-4 yet. Lord, and if there is a bomb at the ceremony? It's all up to you, sir. The Thai baht is quite loud. If anything happens now... I am afraid that the government can not deal with the situation, sir. The current situation should be controlled by the military. The C-4 is missing... suspected to be the job of the military as well? The prime minister wants to not to comment on this matter. The police must find the terrorists... and the missing C-4 and return them. If you exceed your abilities... you can not refuse the help of a soldier. Hey! Wake up! Where have you been? Our Northern Spy reported that it was not... involved with the lack of C-4, sir. Commander, the movements of Hia Por are normal. What is happening then? If such amount of C-4 were stolen to be used in this event... I think there should be some movement, sir. I only have 24 hours. We should know who they are they are and what they want. Sir, here's the team photo elite that has some movement. We're eyeballing in them, sir. Seize everyone and investigate for whom they are working. We need to stop them until may the ceremony be over. The rest of you are going search for information... and report back to me. Did you see my cat? Did you see my cat? Did you see my cat? Shit! Hey! Freeze! Hey! Stop! Stop! Stop! D1 calls each section to stop it. Checks inside! Where is Nawin? I do not know. They paid me to dress like that and sit here. Go! We look everywhere, but we can not find him, sir. For who you work? I do not know. Do not lie to me! Here it is Sir. Tell her face, you're going to get hurt. I do not know. Shit! Do not push me imbecile. Speak! Please, Come out, sir. Speak! What shall we do, sir? Shit! He continues saying he does not know. I think he is telling the truth. Let him go. After being in debt with the IMF for 580 billion Baht... the Thai government led by Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra... will pay all debts to the IMF tomorrow. This is to mean independence economic development of all Thais. Today will mark one day. history for the country... all Thais they will be free of debt. Thailand will become a economy again. Continues! It is a pity that this be the last trip. Do you know about joy? He was arrested. Hey! You know, there were so many police that day. Damn joy! Why are you here? C'mon C'mon. Fast. Wait! Stand still! Go... Lying on the floor, everyone on the floor! Let's go... Check all areas in detail. Take all the suspects, for research. Clear! You're the justice! Kill, kill, ah... Come on! Of course! Go! Hey! The suspect was shot. We found 2 jeeps that recently fought with us. They were left at the roadside, Mr. But there is no other evidence. There is an interesting person though. We should get some information from him. He is Hia Song, owner of the port. Great work? I do not have much time. If you do not talk, you will be in trouble. Send the police to Hydron Hotel and stop Hia Song. Everyone should know Your jobs. No screws lift. We do not have much time! Hey! Wait for me. It's ok! Let's see what the plan is like. This is the place. Let's split up into 4 teams. Each team will assemble, the base in these 4 buildings. We should avoid call attention of the police around of the installations. Do not forget that the government posted many cops. The pumps will be installed... in the main structures of each building. This is for maximum destruction. When you finish your work, come to the marked point... and wait for your next orders. Any question? Good! Come on! What you want? The cops are blocking all inputs and outputs. All pay attention, to the movement downstairs. Chak, you give the orders. Repeat! Gunmen... wait for my orders Sorry to keep You waiting, sir. All is ready, sir. The government will reimburse, the IMF in an hour. What else can you do? Government thinks! I'm making idle threats... then the lives of hundreds are at stake. You still have time to abort. We're going to do our job. Sir. you make yours. The pumps are located in 4 buildings. The first pump is in the American Trading Tower. Send some cops, to the American Trading Tower. Fast! Fast!

You have much to do. Please inform all buildings that you own the pumps. Evacuate calmly. Keep me informed about progress. Let's see! Shit! Come on, quick. Come on, let's go!
