What is your little freak doing here? - He hasn't seen daylight in a long time. - He shouldn't be here. - Gunnar! - No! Mom! Mom! - Mom! - Shut up! Shut up! Let me go! You fuck! I'm not your father! The search for an 11-year-old boy continues in Jotunheimen... Who has been missing for two days. He disappeared in the area of the "Stehoe" mountain hotel. It is believed that the boy is dead after so many days in the cold. The search continues around the desolate mountain hotel... But will be terminated once it gets dark tonight. The rescue crew believes that he has been killed in an avalanche. According to the boy's parents he went out to play... But he didn't return home on time. Hello. It's been a while. What do you want? Sigrid's boy, Gunnar have been missing for two and a half days. I thought he might have sought shelter here. - No. - No one can survive in that cold. Our father is dying, Jon. He doesn't have many hours left. I will not see you or him nor any of the hypocrites out there. Is that clear? COLD PREY III Hello? Gunnar? My boy, you are alive! Sigrid? 12 YEARS LATER Hey! Very funny. You are going to the mountains to get some fresh air? It looks more like you're going for a walk in the park, but... Where are you going? Nowhere special. Just one night alone in the open. Thank you very much for the ride. It was really nice of you. At least you'll be left alone. There aren't many people up here. Thank you. - Anyone else? - No thanks. - Was it a long night yesterday? - Yes, it was. Well, Magne? Did you get any yesterday? Did you have sex? Jon? Need help? I don't know if you've heard, but I have two sons. And they know that they have an uncle. This is a national park, Jon. You know you aren't allowed to hunt here. Do you think he figured out where we are going? He thinks we came up here for the mountain. Yes. Check this out. Isn't it supposed to be plugged in? - Nope. - Call home then. Absolutely amazing. Can I call home? Yes, but the battery is dead. Needs to be charged by the car. This is for hanging it up. You don't know what you're talking about! Have you seen something like this before? - This is as far as a car can go. - Thank you! This is perfect. There's nothing in the water around here but a few hours walk that way... There are good fishing places, you'll catch plenty of fish. - What? - Fishing? Thanks. The bus driver's wife has her 50th birthday party tonight. I doubt there will be a bus tomorrow. However, I can be here at two o' clock. - Thank you. - Thanks for that. Otherwise, it takes six hours to get back. Oh, my God! - You want some water, Knut? - Yes please. - Why not? - Maybe I'll meet a nice girl. - No. - Yes! You've got dry socks on nerd? Helps to avoid a bladder infection. Come on, let's go! How far is it? We are here, and we are going over that hill there. A little further that way and we will be there. There's nothing there. Of course, after everything that happened. They removed it from the map. So that no one would get there ever again. - Simen, this map is from 1930. - And? What actually happened there? The boy went out to play, and never returned. He died in an avalanche. Right, Knut? - Exactly. - They never found him? Nope. Not his parents, either. They disappeared a few days later and were never found. It is said that they still wander restlessly around here. - Simen... - Or was it in the hotel? I think we're here now. Shall we go? It's fine here. We'll light up the fireplace and clean some of the dust. It will be nice. Fucking hell. You bastard. Should we try to find some wood for burning? Siri, will you join us? Siri? - No, I don't want to. - Want what? I don't want to stay here. I don't like the place, It's disgusting. I don't want. Fantastic! Okay, let's go back home then. She doesn't want to be here. Shit! There are rats here. Of course there are rats. The place has been empty for over ten years. - Rats? I'm not sleeping here. - Me neither. You know what? We walked half a day to come here. I'm not leaving. Should we find a place to camp instead? We can light a fire. - We have no tents. - The sun is shining. We don't need tents. We will be fine. Come on, boys. Fucking sissies. Anyone has any mosquito spray? I just took my game with me. Are you cold? I'll be fine. - Look! - It's amazing. God, it's so beautiful. Don't! Come on, Anders! I want to swim. Come! What the hell, Magne... Come on, Magne! Thank you for persuading the others to leave that place. - It was nice of you. - You're welcome. Is there something wrong? You seem worried. I'm just terribly nervous. Is it a good or a bad thing? It is good. It's actually very good. - You're freezing. - Thank you. There's a place out here we can jump out from. Are you coming? No! And put little-Magne back in his pants. You... - I'm so hungry. - Okay, what do we have? Anders? - Anders, you were in charge of the food. - No, I wasn't... Didn't you bring any food? Okay, what will we do? Cold burgers? What? It covers the entire diet pyramid. It has meat, tomatoes, onions... Cheese, bread, sugar, tomato... I have beers! How many? A six pack? That's one beer for each. - Here's to us. - Cheers! Come... How romantic! Where are Knut and Siri going? A: Picking mushrooms? B: Climbing trees? Or C... Have a wild and unrestrained... ...Sex. - Great! - Thank you for your fantasies. Mountain Rule 12... Don't forget to bring a map and condoms. Shut up! Knut! What is it? Siri! Siri! My God, Knut! Siri, you must get help. - Stay still. - Hurry up! Don't move. Hurry, Siri. Help! Help! Siri? Help! Help! Help! He is injured. We must find Knut. I woke up in a hole. You must help us. Knut... He is injured! He is down there and needs help. Knut... I couldn't find the others. I don't know where they are. How many are you? Six. We must find him. I'll help you. Stay here. Do you realize what you've done? It is a human being, not an animal! You are a fucking idiot. Damn freak! Clean up this mess. What if somebody saw you! Have you thought about it? Have you thought about it? No! No! No, let me go! Let me go! No! Anders? Anders! Simen... Nice! Now you scared it. Put that thing away, Simen. Put the gun away. A few hours ago we decided to go on this trip. We all went home to pack, and you picked up a rifle? - It's not a rifle, It's an AG3. - Where did you get that? I joined the National Guard forces. And they think it's OK for you to take it in the trip? You never know when the Russians will invade. What are S, S and F? Secure, single and family. If you want to kill a single person, set it on S. If you want to kill the mother, father and 1.4 children... Set it on F. Where did we find this guy? - You are crazy! - Yes, I am. - Where are Knut and Siri? - They probably chose Option C. Siri! We can forget about meeting the policeman for the ride. Magne, relax! I will carry you from here. I don't like this anymore... Hello! Is anybody there? Knut? Hello? Hedda? Damn, Simen! Are you stupid or what? You could have hit someone. Simen? Come! Run! - What's happening? - Run! - Faster, Magne! - Hedda! Anders! Run! Come on! Hedda! What's happening? Come on! Magne, come! What's happening? Move! A house! Hello! Come! Come on. Hedda, what's going on? Hedda, what's going on? Hedda... Hedda? What happened? Simen is dead. What do you mean? He's lying dead against a tree. Then he came after me. He killed Simen. Jon! Jon? Jon! Help! Shut up. It will be alright. Yes... Yes. So yes. So, so, so... Hey, it's me. He wasn't home. They didn't come. I suppose they got a ride from someone else. Quiet, Magne! Magne! How long do we have to stay here? I get claustrophobia. Magne, what are you doing? Come back down! Magne! No! Over on the other side. We have to swim across! Anders! Come on! Come on! No! Anders! Anders! Hedda, you must find Magne. We must find a hiding place for you first. Give me your hand. We have to hurry. Does it hurt? No, it's fine. Do you think Magne is still alive? I don't know. I must find him. You are safe here. I'll be back. I promise. Damn... Come on! Damn. Jon? Damn. Come on now. Hello? Hello? Yes, this is Einar. No, I haven't seen him. Not the other kids either. I found only a walkman. I have a bad feeling about this. Stop! No! Stop! Magne. Can you hear me, Magne? What the hell are you doing? You were supposed to clean up this mess! Where are the others? She is mine. There are two more out there. Find them! Here... Careful. Anders, we will hide ourselves here. Come. Good! Come on. Come on. It will be alright. One, two... - You must go, Hedda. - No. - I will not leave you. - He's coming! I will not leave you. No! Come on, Anders. Come on. We have to get out of here. Come, Anders. Yes, they were six. Are you sure? Call me if you hear anything. Fine. Bye! This is a national park, Jon. You know you aren't allowed to hunt here. Missing - Unresolved cases. EVIL HOTEL. Dog found skinned in the mountains. Grazing sheep mass grave in the mountains. Sigrid's boy, Gunnar has been missing for two and a half days. No one can survive in that cold. No, I haven't seen anything. Anders... Look! We need to call for help. Didn't you hear me? We need to call the police! Come in. But he has to stay outside. Anders, Anders! Move! He tried to take the shotgun. Watch him. Hello? Hello! - Hedda! - Siri...? Siri! It's locked, I can't open it! Siri! It's over, Siri. It's over now. Knut is dead. Car keys. No! What the hell are you doing? You can't do a damn thing. I shouldn't have brought you here. I should have left you to freeze to death. I should have left you because you can't... No!
