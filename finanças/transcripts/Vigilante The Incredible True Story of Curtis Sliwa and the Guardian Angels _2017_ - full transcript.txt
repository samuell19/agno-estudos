(funky music) (police sirens in distance) (dramatic jazzy music) - It was a normal night, I had my three hours and then all of a sudden woke up in a cold sweat because I'm always fearful I'm gonna be late. And I was doing the morning radio show at the most powerful radio station in the nation. So, I'm out of the house, immediately I'm running up to the all-night news stand in the Lower East Side which was part of the Alphabet Jungle back then, avenues A, B, C, D, I'm able to hail a yellow cab. And the yellow cab comes right to me. And when I jump in the back of the car and I say, "Hey, Mack, Madison Square Garden, I'm running late." And he said, "Hey, no problem, Curtis." It's like I hit Powerball, the Lotto, whoa. Remember this is 1992, most cab drivers, they were tending goats outside of Amman, Jordan, just three days before, they didn't have a hack license, they didn't know their way around, they didn't even know how to drive a car. Yet somehow, they were in a yellow cab. This guy, a white guy, a guy who spoke English, a guy who knew me, now I could max and relax, read the sports pages, I was in Seventh Heaven, this was Nirvana for me. And then at about 13th Street, instead of going left to the West Side, where Madison Square Garden is, he turns right and he goes east towards the East River. And I said, "Hey, Mack, turn this hack around." And now he really bares down, and all of a sudden, I hear strange ruffling from the front of the car near the passenger side. And unbeknownst to me, a guy had been stuck underneath the dashboard, awaiting his opportunity. And he comes up with a .38, he's wearing a mask, an Irish walking cap, and he has his ass, his tuchus, on the back of the dashboard, and all of a sudden, he's aiming that .38 at my three-piece set, and I'm not talking about the knife, the spoon, and the fork. I'm gonna dive and try to open up the door, unbeknownst to me, they had taken this stolen cab to a chop shop and they had turned it into a rolling coffin 'cause they knew I would fight back. And they sawed off the handles, and put 'em back on with crazy glue, so what happens when I grab the handle to open up the door to dive into incoming traffic? The handle comes into my hand and pop! And I see how the gun goes back, and then all of sudden the flames are coming right out of the barrel of the gun. And it's heading towards my lower extremity, and clearly I had been hit but I don't feel jack diddly squat. I had never been shot before, shot at, yeah. But never shot before, and I'm assuming, wow, I'm gonna be gripped in pain, I'm gonna be bleeding. But there's nothing, and then all of a sudden, he raises the gun and he shoots it again. And I see the fire coming out of the barrel of the gun. But this time, I feel pain, incredible pain, cramping. The most incredible cramping I had ever had in my life. I can't even breathe now, now, I had been shot twice. So I'm bleeding like a sieve, and the gunman had hollow-point bullets so when upon impact they hit me, they started shredding everything inside before they tried to make their way out my back. I used the seat behind me as a trampoline, and I dive in the direction of what I think is an open window, the gunman has now put the .38 in my back and clicked off his final shot. And upon doing that, pushes me out the window. And the assumption is, I think from the driver and the gunman is he's dead on arrival. There's no way he's gonna survive that. Well, guess what, John Gotti Junior, let me ask you this. If you're such a man's man, alright, you see all this damage, you see all this? These are the bullets that Iannotti put into me based on your orders, from Gambino headquarters. And he took the Code of Omerta to protect you. He's doing 20 years and you're out of your ponderosa there in Oyster Bay, Long Island, pleading poverty like you can't live that you were used to living when you were the number one capo di tutti (boss of all bosses) in organized crime, in the shadow of your father, the man who called on me to get hit by you, John Gotti Senior, you're all a disgrazia. (uptempo alt-rock music) Oh, the ugly '70s, it turned New York City into like, the armpit of the cesspool of crime. I gotta tell ya, it was an era of Uzi toting, dope sucking, psychopathic killing machines laying siege to the outer boroughs and Manhattan itself. Various street gangs with cut-off knee jackets, rockets and patches, trying to imitate the Hell's Angels except they had no Harley Davidsons But they were an enemy and a menace to society. And they were on the trains and the trains themselves were scarred with graffiti, you couldn't look out of the train windows to even know what train station it was coming to, with the smell of defecation and urine everywhere, it was an attack on your senses. And even if nothing happened to you on your trip on the subway, you just felt so violated. - [Reporter] The graffiti-scarred subway system, deafening sounds, frequent equipment failures, three million people jammed together each day, riding through 230 miles of what often can be a subterranean nightmare, a haven for crime and violence. - Hey, do you have any money? - I'm not your street pawn, I'm not your street pawn. - Yeah, she want no beef right now. - And then let's say you were going to the Deuce, 42nd Street. You would go right on this great white wave, Broadway, and you would see theater after theater that had no shows on it's promenade. You go down Restaurant Row and restaurants were being closed because of the cretins with chromosome damage, and so many miscreants who were just snatchin' pocket books, who were pickpocketing and jostling. Then you had these greasy-haired pimps that looked like Super Fly, TNT, out of those black exploitation movies in the '70s. And then they had their men, women, I don't know if they were frozen vegetables, who were walkin' up and down, they would sell ya their butt, they would sell you anything you wanted and take you 'round the world in 80 seconds. And naturally, like vendors selling popcorn, drug dealers everywhere, so the feeling was that when you're finished walking through Times Square, you needed to take like, a hot shower. Now, some people would get a vicarious thrill out of that but most people would be paralyzed by fear. And all of a sudden, you were living a life of fear. You're a grown man, 6 foot 2, 220 pounds, all buff, and some little cretin could come up to you who's like 4 foot 8, 80 pounds soaking wet, and grimace, and have a frown on their face, and you would give 'em all your money because you would be afraid that they would take your life. $5, give ya three flicks, the brothers would be in there talking trash at the screen, they'd be pullin' their tooties out, sometimes shooting at the screen. And that behavior would go right out into the streets. It was just a seething cesspool of crime, drugs, prostitution, decadence, and debauchery. This is the era of the '70s that bled into the crack era of the 80s, and had New York City in the grip of decadence, of debauchery, of hopelessness and despair. People who had money, they packed their bags and they left, people who were living on fixed income, like in the Bronx where I started the Guardian Angels, all they did was put more bars on the windows, more locks on the doors, and that's the New York City that spawned yours truly, Curtis Sliwa. You know, in the 1960s, all roads led to Canarsie or through Canarsie out to Long Island, that's one up the county, because it was the last refuge in the city for white ethnics. Jews escaping Brownsville, the public housing projects and tenements, and Italians from nearby East New York, they stopped off in Canarsie, but it was like two totally different worlds; the very best, the very worst. Oh, I remember that day I broke my mother's heart, Francesca, I was going to junior high school at the time, Bildersee Junior High School, my grades were good. But then all of sudden, I started chasin' skirts. I was interested in trim, you know, a shot of lake. And my grades plummeted, all you had to do was throw on some cheap Chanel Number 5, some toilet water, and have a nice pear figure, and all of sudden I went mishegoss. And my mother said to me, "Curtis, Curtis, what is wrong with you, you used to sleep with your baseball glove, now you're talking about sleeping with girls, we gotta get you into an all-boys school, you gotta go back to Catholic school." I said, "Oi, back to Catholic school." And it was my dad who came to my rescue. He left the ship where he was a merchant seaman and he said, "Hey, kid, you got three choices. Go back to school, that's the easiest. Pack your bags, and get the hell outta here, I never wanna see you again, or go out and get a job, and pay $70 a week, room and board." I had no negotiable skills and I saw an ad in the New York Daily News, night managers for McDonald's, wanting, and I heard my calling from Ray Kroc, and I got on that number two train to Beast, went for my interview, and the next thing ya know, I'm a night manager at Micky D's. It was a nightmare AM and a double nightmare PM. And luckily, I didn't listen to Marvin Barnes, the general manager that I was assigned to, because he did everything by the book. Oak Brook, Illinois, you know, McDonald's University. They wouldn't even let me go. - And courtesy is what makes it all run smoothly. - Give me a filet o fish. - Thank you. - Good afternoon. - And a chocolate shake. - May I help you? - Sure, hi, yeah. - [Narrator] Courtesy that begins working for you the minute you great the customer. You've got the idea. - Right, coming right up. - [Narrator] Smile, all the time, whenever there are customers around. And even when they're not, smiles are contagious too. - I came under the influence of my mentor, and my (foreign language), my friend for life, Don Chin, who was another night manager who said, "You could either do it the McDonald's way in the Bronx and six of our employees will carry your casket, and be at your burial. And we'll give ya, I'll give ya a great eulogy. Or you can do it the Don Chin way and survive to live another day." (jazzy music) And he told me, "Lesson number one, you're a white boy, you're a (foreign language), you're dead meat up here." Where it's mostly blacks and Hispanics. "You're a sucker, you have, on your forehead, the word sucker and everyone is gonna try to Vic you down. They're gonna try to victimize you from the time you come into the store, the time you run your shift, to the time you gotta make the drop, the bank depository drop across the street in the bank, to the time you gotta leave to take the train all the way back to Brooklyn," where I was livin' at the time. So I listened intently, and then I walked into the area where they prepare the burgers, fries, and strawberry shakes and over the warmers, over the bin, Don had an array of pipes, sticks, bats, all kinds of home-made weapons. And he said, "Lesson number two is that you're gonna hire a crew to cover your back, I don't care if they burn burgers on the grill, I gotta know, when I go over the counter to deal with the problem in the lobby that my crew is in solidarity." It's us and we not I and me, and that stuck with me. And so time and time again, I'd have to go over the counter, brothers would come up to me, and they pull the old classic trick. They'd buy a Big Mac and eat seven-eighths of the Big Mac, come back up front say, "I wanna see the manager." And I'd come up front, and I'd look and I'd see most of the Mac was gone. "Hey, I want either another Mac or I want my money back." And I would say to them, based on Don Chin's training, "What do you think, 'cause I'm white, I'm a sucker? Nah," and they'd say, "Okay, (stammering angrily) you're gonna claim that I'm ripping you off, white boy? You better come over here and we'll settle our differences man to man." And back then, it was one on one. The crowd would yell, "One on one, one on one!" Black and white, that's all you had to do. And people started pourin' in, in the streets. And I can handle myself, and man, I would pick 'em up, body slam 'em, and you would hear the bones in their ribcage rattle and all of a sudden, I had street rep, hey, the mad Chinaman, Don Chin, was considered number one, second to none. But I was earnin' my strikes and I slowly but surely got to the point where I understood what Don meant. And then Don decided to give me the ultimate test. One night, he was off, and he must've been in a gin mill banging back a few Irish car bombs. He loved Jameson, and he comes in on his Harley, into the lobby at McDonald's, and he's wielding a machete, the wild Chinaman, and he jumps over the counter and he comes back into the grill area. And he challenges me to a duel and I remember, as a kid, I loved Zorro, that was my hero as a little whipper snapper growing up, so I grab my machete and it was like I was Zorro and he had the best of me. And at one point, I was blockin' his machete thrust and he had me bent over this hot grill. And lucky for me, he snapped out of it. And then he started to laugh, he had this belly laugh in which I passed the final Don Chin test. He hopped over the counter, he got onto his Harley, and he rode away, and everyone in that McDonald's, nobody left, none of my crew members, they had my back. And I made my bones, and I knew from then on, I could dominate the streets and the subways of the Bronx. (dramatic music) - They have reclaimed our neighborhood for us. I can now walk out in my neighborhood because of these citizens. - Wouldn't you feel safer? They're having a gang like that walking through your streets, of course you would, so we do too. (uptempo music) - And then one night, things really, deep six. The Savage Nomads were competing with the Savage Skulls and the Black Spades to be the number one gang in all of the Bronx, bum rushed me in that Micky D's. - Conquered enemies. Those are our conquered enemies right there. Which one's there or what their names are. Hit it floor, Joe, relax, relax. I'm just explaining to them about enemies, compadre, cool? (uptempo music) Past-tense enemies, what happened through the past. - So they come in and they start pullin' the chairs out. You know, these are metal chairs, and they start smashing the front window panes, now, we're talking a lot of moola shmoola, a lot of duckets, a lot of cheddar there, that was gonna come out of my pocket. So I jump over the counter and I'm catching a beat down and my crew, at first, hesitated 'cause these guys were Bad with a capital B. And then slowly but surely, I heard 'em jumpin' over, they were pulling guys off, they were hitting guys with the bats, the sticks, and the chains that we had assembled on the grill area in preparation for any kind of all-out assault. And we fought off the Savage Nomads. We had created a sanctuary, we had created a zone probably the only place in the Bronx at that time where you could go at night, and be unfettered by any gangbangers, criminals, miscreants, or thugs, or thugettes, and I said, you know something, I should apply this to the trains. And that's when I realized, after watchin' Bronson in Death Wish, De Niro in Taxi Driver, I wasn't gonna live vicariously through these vigilante movies that were the hits of the '70s. It was time for me to fight back. But I couldn't do it by myself. And the seeds of the subway patrol that I created were put into place. (dramatic music intensifies) (rock music) So now I started to think about a uniformed presence. Something identifiable, a red beret, a t-shirt, something that would equate to people that this is organized, there's a regiment, there's a discipline, it's not a street gang. Because that's what the Bronx was known for. There were street gangs in every neighborhood. Sometimes there'd be two on every block. And so I went through the preparation. I brainwashed my closing crew which consisted of, lucky for me, blacks, Hispanics, whites, and yeah, even two Chinese brothers. And I convinced 'em, come on out! Ride the trains with me at night. But slowly but surely, I was able to convince them that we could do this, and everyday they would come back to renew their shift at like 4 o'clock or 8 o'clock at night, and work to closing, 12:00 or 2:00 in the morning, and suddenly they would be deflated because everyone at home would say, hey, that guy's a white devil, are you crazy? He's putting nonsense into your head. You could be shot, killed, who's gonna care about you? No, no, no, no, no, avoid him at all costs. And yet, I would get back into their hearts, minds, and souls, and eventually, we began to patrol. But, oh, I couldn't have been more hopelessly wrong about the way this would be accepted. I thought we were gonna earn the Congressional Medal of Honor, I thought this was the highest form of selfless service, risking your life, going out on patrol on the number four train, the muggers express, the number two train, the Beast, wearing a uniform that made you look like a Pop-and-Fresh Pillsbury Doughboy and Doughgirl in a red beret and a white t-shirt. And all of a sudden, the Warriors was debuted by Paramount Pictures, it's become a cult-classic film. In which it depicted gangs on the subways. That was February 8th of 1979, February 13th I announced that 13 young men would begin to patrol the city subway system and one day there would be 13,000, and before I could get that last word out of my mouth, the guy who had befriended us and who would actually put us on a pedestal, Ed Koch, that's the new mayor, vilified us. He put the scarlet letter on us. He said this is vigilantism, he would call us the Hell's Angels, reporters would correct him and say, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no. They're the Magnificent 13 Subway Safety Team." "Aw, they're like the Hell's Angels, they're vigilantes, I'm not gonna let 13 young men in sneakers provide public safety in the city of New York," and from that, the cops, who had suffered incredible cut-backs in staffing because the city was on the brink of going chapter 11, so they were concerned about their colleagues getting back on the job. And now, all of a sudden, the police unions were saying, by any means necessary, stop them. - They're inexperienced, they really know nothing about what they're doing, someone's going to get hurt. I think it all comes to a head, maybe when one of these kids gets killed. - We are prepared to die for our commitment, we get paid well, it's true, but we are the representatives of law enforcement for the society. Not a bunch of rag-tag kids with sneakers on, who have absolutely no concept of what law enforcement is. - And so, the call to arms for all the cops was, arrest them, you see them, cite them, write 'em tickets, lock 'em up, drive this idealism out of them because we truly believe it, you scratch 'em right down to their bones, they're nothin' but thugs and thugettes. That in fact their motivation is such that they'll just become another gang. - On December 30th, 1981, Guardian Angel, Frank Melvin, on patrol in the Dayton Street housing project in Newark, New Jersey, was shot once through the heart and killed by a Newark police officer. - A police officer, identified to us by the members of this patrol, badge number 891, a sergeant, called Kasey, stopped Frank dead in his tracks. Frank opened up his jacket, said, "No need to shoot, I'm a Guardian Angel." Exposed the shirt, no weapon being exposed, no threat to any police officer, and without one word being uttered by any other police officers there, was shot dead. For you and I who fight back, we get called vigilante. We get called, accusing of abusing other personal rights and privileges, who have been the hemorrhoids most often to Guardian Angels? The criminals who we're risking our life without weapons to stop, why is it that the police have been our major adversaries in the cities around America? The deck was stacked against us. And Ed Koch, who had been one who saluted us, was now doin' everything he could to stick the shiv in us. People were coming to the McDonald's, from Brooklyn, from Queens, from other parts of the Bronx, from Manhattan, even Staten Island, to join. And this was great, we put 'em through a training program. And they started subway patrols in their own areas. And all of a sudden, we began to slowly grow. But in the interim, I was getting locked up. Other Guardian Angels were getting locked up, set up by the cops, they just try to so decompress us, so depress us that we would give up these patrols late at night until the wee hours of the morning. And then on September 4th, Labor Day, 1979, our numbers had grown so we were no longer 13. - [Reporter] The Guardian Angels, they started as 13 kids with a plan to fight street crime. Now they've grown to more than 1,000. From New York, to Philadelphia, Atlanta, Los Angeles. Across the nation, the red berets are helping the cities in fear. - And we were asked to patrol Central Park because there was a series of gay bashings in the rambles. And at the time, the police were very homophobic. Ha, they'd say, "Oh, you're a gay guy? You deserve it then," and so we took it upon ourselves to go in there and patrol so that they gay bashings would stop, and all of a sudden we were embraced by the counter-culture, in fact, the Clash, the counter-culture group of our lifetime, actually dedicated a song to our exploits called Red Angel Dragons, oh, now, we were considered like, hip-hop, graffiti artists, and Guardian Angels. And I walk into this Bushido, this Japanese art gallery, and I see this drop-dead gorgeous statuesque woman. Well-spoken, just radiating, not only with beauty but with strength, and class, totally above what anything I had ever been with involved with before that. She was top-shelf, five star, a woman would come from a privileged background, enriched with New Jersey, as opposed from the heart of the hood. But she had a way of mesmerizing, and she was intoxicating. And she walks up to me and she says, "You know, I was thinkin' about joining the Guardian Angels, what do I have to do to join?" I said, "Well," I said, "Lady, you know, you have to come up to the Bronx. And you gotta fight your way through an Apache line, because that's the way you had to earn your cred to join us because it was considered you were like a kamikaze pilot." It was suicidal to join us at that time. You had to have fighting skills. She said, "Oh, I'm a practitioner of Goju-ryu Karate, I'm a black belt," and I said, "Well, look, anytime you're ready, come on up. Six guys on one side, six guys on the other side, and then there's a guy at the end. And you gotta fight through all of 'em. And you're gonna catch quite the beat-down." Well, guess what, she showed up on a Friday night. She was gi'd down, we took her in the park where we train, and she fought through the 13. She got hit but she gave it as good as she took. She had 13 inch combat boots on at the time. Which, I say, yeah, she's hardcore. And from there, she earned her cred by going out on patrols, developed the leadership, that obviously she was a natural born leader to begin with. And earned the credibility of a group of predominantly black and Hispanics, and convinced us, the male machismo that was pumping through our veins and arteries, that we needed to get women involved. And through her leadership, she attracted so many other women, and diversified the makeup of the group. And assisted me, she was side by side with me. - I joined the Guardian Angels because I wanted to help other people. And once I learned how to defend myself, I thought that I could share that and make some impact on the community. And I think I joined for the same reason that a lot of other kids did, and that's we live in a rough neighborhood, and we didn't like what we were seeing. - And I fell hopelessly in love with her. I mean, that was the real first love of my life. Because we were working together, we had a mission, we were idealistic, we had so much in common that we couldn't have been more different in terms of our orientation and our upbringing. She had gone to the best schools. She had the pedigree, I was the blue-collar working class kid from Canarsie, Brooklyn, but not only did we have the urge to merge but it was a spiritual bond that helped us overcome all the adversarial situations that we had to face in the future as our group began to grow and expand throughout the country and the world. - Tonight on Prisoners of Fear, the Guardian Angels. They have been described by some as thugs, vigilantes, amateur crime fighters, they have been criticized by police departments across the country but praised by ordinary citizens who say they feel safer with the Angels around. - These people are puttin' their lives on the line, they're very respectful, they don't bother anybody, they don't look for trouble. They carry no weapons, they have our full support. - I feel very strongly that the Guardian Angels, I've had some experience from particularly at night, and I'm very happy to see them. And I feel they provide a worthwhile service. - I'm very glad they're around. I'm very glad they're around. - A person committing a crime, they think twice before they do anything because these guys are there. - You know, we've seen them up in our neighborhood, we live up in the Bronx. They were escorting some ladies home. - To church. - You know, when you see something like that, that's very nice. - They're actin' like angels. (laughing) - Guardian Angels. - More or less, yeah. - [Reporter] I mean, what is it they do, I mean, don't you think that maybe a bunch of vigilantes-- - They stop people from harming other like, older people, like, ladies, you know, females that be riding the trains late from home from work. You know, things like that. - I see 'em more than I see cops, 'cause you know, they be on the train, they be on the train every time I get off the train, I always bump into a Guardian Angel, not always, but as I get off the train, I seen one walks past. - They watch out for you, you know, like a Guardian Angel. - Now, at the time, my nickname was the Rock. Because I could rock your world. I could hit you so hard, your mother would feel the vibrations, and I had a nasty veneer on me. In fact, I would chew nails, it was all part of the psychology, of proving that I was tougher than tough. Because, again, in this urban environment, being a white guy immediately targeted you as a sucker, as being soft, weak, someone who would fold like a cheap camera, and not necessarily be absorbed into the street culture that was dominated by the black and Hispanics. And yet, with Lisa, obviously she revealed my softer side. So, I was a guy at the time who threw nickles around like manhole covers, here she was, an elite model. She's doing magazine spreads, she's with the paparazzi, she's with the page-six people, she's with the cultural elite, and I am down there, you know, knuckle dragging with street folks, so I approached her one time in a moment of weakness, 'cause we were out of sight, out of mind, and I took her for some dirty water hotdogs right, and we had some Doctor Brown's 'cause I loved Doctor Brown's, the cherry soda. And we began to bond then, and I could see, this wasn't beneath her, a dirty water hotdog, a Doctor Brown's, I mean, it was cool that I could see that she could relate, and slowly but surely, we began to work with one another. We began to go to events with one another. We became one of those couples that everyone was fascinated with because they couldn't quite figure out what would she be doing with this guy. And what would this guy be doing with Lisa. And she was living in the Lower East Side. Right there on Avenue 8 and St. Mark's Place. And I moved from the Bronx to be with Lisa 24/7, 365. People were shocked because they said, "Man, what happened to the Rock?" He's become a pebble! - So, I've never seen the show, I don't like the show. I'm sure the audience doesn't even like the show. - Howard, you're in such a bad mood today. - Yeah, but the truth that I came on is because I like you two guys. - Well, thank you. - We're the hosts, you're supposed to be the guest. (laughing) The other thing, wait a minute, wait a minute, the other thing is, no. The other thing I wanna tell you is maybe-- - Doesn't she look great without that stupid beret? (laughing) Doesn't she look great? (applauding) Isn't that beautiful? (hooting and hollering) The first time I've seen the top of your head. (old pop music) - Today we're going to attempt to find out why younger and younger children are turning to crime and drugs, what's really influencing children to choose a path of crime and drugs, a group dedicated to fight crime, Curtis Sliwa. (uptempo 80s music) - [Announcer] Welcome to Larry King Live. Tonight, taking back the streets. - Here to talk about the drug crisis from the street perspective, is the founder of the Guardian Angels, Curtis Sliwa. (uptempo 80s music) (crowd applauding) - Old friend, Curtis Sliwa, founder of the Guardian Angels civilian patrol group. - Founder and president of the Guardian Angels, Curtis Sliwa. - [Reporter] Members in this band of angels are all over 60. Let's meet them. (uptempo 80s music) - I'm Julian Khan, age 70. - I'm George Glover, I'm 65. - I'm Henry Goodman, aged 78. - Cleaver Vincent, 80 years old, the oldest Guardian Angel in the United States. - Ladies and gentlemen, live at the Clash of the Champions, the man who stands for law and order, weighing 337 pounds, the Guardian Angel. (crowd chanting) (uptempo music) - Everyone on the periphery, everyone was involved in the artistic world, the creative world, couldn't get enough of the guardian angels. I remember, there we were in Studio 54, as all the freakazoids, the jetsetters, the trendoids, were down on the dance floor, as all of a sudden, people like Stallone wanted to take pictures with us, Trump, people were just coming to us. The dark side of the Batman, as he emerged, we recognized this sort of new creation of Batman. Some of it was attributed to the effect of the Guardian Angels in the streets. The Watchmen Series attributed to the Guardian Angels. So many things I had no idea what the origin was, attributed to the effect that the Guardian Angels were having not only on our culture, but in our way of life. And this fight-back mentality of being independent, and autonomous, and it was sort of like David versus Goliath the Guardian Angels taking on City Hall, the Guardian Angels taking on the power elite, getting arrested, getting humiliated, getting vilified. And yet, we were the peoples' choice. And then suddenly the people who controlled the processing of the culture of our society, who said that, oh, the Guardian Angels are like hip-hop, are like graffiti, are like the Clash. So from day one, this, the house that I grew up in, that my mother spent most of her time in her life growing up in, served as the administrative headquarters of the local effort and then the global effort of the Guardian Angels, so, in the basement is where a lot of our paperwork and our archiving, and documents are stored, this is where all the day-to-day needs of running a non-profit are satisfied by administrators, but it's also a place where Guardian Angels have come and gone. Particularly when they're visiting, they'll stay here instead of no-tell motel, Holiday Inn. But it was also the home of my father and mother. My father, when he was alive, my mother who lives upstairs, it's her house, and originally, it was the home of my grandparents, of Fidel and Nicoletta Bionquino. They lived all in just that one room. My two sisters lived and slept in bunk beds in this front room, this was our living room, that was our kitchen, my mom and dad had a room to the side and the smallest room in the corner was mine. And we all lived down here. (rising music) There was a prejudice in this city that if you are black and Hispanic growing up in the hood, and especially the Bronx, or parts of Brooklyn, that you had a criminal orientation, that it was in your DNA so when we were taking in recruits, we did something to defy the authorities. And defy pragmatic and common sense. If you came to me and said, "I have a record, can I qualify?" And I'd say, well, thanks for being honest but we have to know the extent of what you were accused of, and what you were found guilty of. And other than murder, or arson, or selling weight in terms of drugs, or rape, or incest, or sexual assault, we took you on, even if you had quite the criminal record, you know, like 500 Scott tissue papers long, and we would tell these young men and young women, hey, today, you start all over again. It's like you had a re-birth, a resurrection. You start with a fresh piece of paper because once you get through the training, the orientation to become a Guardian Angel, now all of a sudden people were gonna glom onto you. They're gonna wanna praise you. They're gonna wanna beep their horn, they're gonna wanna pat you on the back. They're gonna wanna take you home and introduce you to your family where normally, if you weren't wearing the red beret and the white t-shirt with the Guardian Angel logo, they'd be running from you scared, they wouldn't make eye contact with you because they believe the stereotype. - When I put these colors on, I go through the streets with a lot of pride. - I've always wanted to join the Guardian Angels, ever since I was a little kid. - I have a conscience, I've always felt guilty for what I've done in my past. And I just chose to do something about it. When an old lady comes up to me and says, you know, God bless you, I'm glad you're here. You can't replace that feeling with money. You know, that's pure, that's from the heart. And you can't buy that feeling. - You have an opportunity of not just elevating yourself and redoing all the negatives you've done throughout your life but also recasting in your entire community with a different look. (disrupting commotion) (whistle blowing loudly) - A lot of people would always wanted to see, are we just to trust you, how do we know that it's not gonna go over the top, over the edge? Well, at times it does, but that's where you have the checks and balances, we have no weapons, no special powers or privileges. Every Guardian Angel is searched before they go out on patrol and searched when they return from patrol. And you may ask, why do you search them? Hah, because we don't trust 'em. This is not like the blue wall of silence with the cops. And in fact, if the cops trusted one another so much, why do they have master locks on their lockers in their dressing room? Because they'll steal from one another. And remember, you're constantly told, no special powers or privileges, you just have the rights that a citizen has to make a citizen's arrest. But if you grab the wrong person, you use excessive physical force, not only will you get arrested, but the organization, including the grand poobah, Curtis Sliwa, are gonna get sued. - If you're the type of person that has a hot head, if you're the type of person that thinks yeah, as soon as I get the t-shirt and the beret, that's it, I'm gonna do my own thing. Then there's the door. - Have I arrived at scenes where the Guardian Angels were in the gray area? You better believe it, have I had to clean up the mess in terms of what the Guardian Angels were accused of doing? Yeah, you have to believe it, but each and every time that I was able to clean up a mess, I was able to incorporate that into a better training program so as to avoid making the same mistake again. And more importantly, acknowledge it, that that was a setback for us. (steady somber music) - I personally don't believe in what would be termed as paramilitary groups, I think that if you want to help in law enforcement and you're not a police officer, you should join the auxiliary police. - I was branded with a scarlet letter, the big V for vigilante, couldn't shake it. So I had reverse osmosis, I decided, why fight the label, vigilante? Because it's like being on a treadmill, I was getting nowhere, I saw with Mayor Koch, one on one at city hall in New York. I sat with Jane Burn in city hall in Chicago, the mayor. I sat with Diane Feinstein who was the mayor in San Francisco, all of them said, in a one on one meeting, they would bag and tag me as a vigilante and run me out of their respective cities. And I stood up and I said, A, we have the right to make a citizen's arrest like any other citizen. That's not a vigilante act but the whole notion of vilifying vigilantes is so reflective of how you have distorted the history. You are revisionists, vigilantes were necessary when there was no law and order. When there was no badge, there was no shield. There was no organized policing. There were times when settlers were moving west in this country where you had no law and order. The town residents had to get together. They called it Posse Comitatus and they would go after the horse thieves, they would go after the bank robbers. They would go after the rapists and marauders. And sure, often times, there would be justice in which all of a sudden you'd get a necktie hung from the nearest tree, and that was the bad part of it. But the whole notion of organizing and going out there and grabbing the bad guys was good. And so all I did was eliminate all the negatives and maintain the positive core. That we would bring together young men and young women, the least likely to get together, the ones that you were generally afraid of, paralyzed of, and you would hope that if nothing more they would mind their P's and Q's, sit on the sidelines and not get into trouble. And we would proactively get them to preemptively stop crime and if necessary, grab the individuals responsible and be positive role models. And if that meant that I was gonna be labeled with a scarlet letter, the big V of vigilante, so be it. (funky music) You know, the question I'm always asked no matter where I travel around the world, hey, Sliwa, what ever happened to that guy in the subway, you know, the subway gunman? They forget the name, Bernhard Goetz. And on this particular day, Bernhard Goetz passed for milquetoast, geek, right? You know, with the pocket protector, you know, just a real fuddy duddy, basically with a big V on him that said victim, victim. But unbeknownst to us, we didn't know that prior, on prior occasions, Bernhard Goetz had been victimized in the subways, one time, down near the Lansley Street, thugs took him and threw him through a plate glass window as they robbed him, and it degraded him, humiliated him. And he said, never again, he went off to New Hampshire, live free or die, where they believe in guns. And he took rapid gun response training, combat gun training, and he carried that piece wherever he went, and then on one Saturday, he's going downtown, not far from city hall. And all of a sudden, walking through that number two train, the Beast, was Troy Canty, James Ramseur, Barry Allen, and Darrell Cabey, oh I remember all four of their names. We knew that they would go onto the trains, on the weekends especially, first the arcades on the Deuce, 42nd street, and would sharpen screwdrivers. They'd try to break into machines that had a lot of coin, they would break in to all the pay telephones that were always vandalized and broken into for the coin, and then, it was like Clockwork Orange, they loved to get a vicarious thrill, all four of them, by coming up to people in the subways and chumping them up. Not always to rob them but to show them at any point, they could reach out, touch them, rob them, kill them, rape them, and just completely emasculate them. And when they saw Bernhard Goetz sitting in front of them, oh, they came out to play, and they had sort of surrounded him, anybody being in that circumstance would know right then, you were gonna get victimized. Most people wouldn't know what do. He pulled out his gun and he fired in rapid sequence. Bang, bang, bang, and then when all of a sudden, one of the guys fell to the ground. He said, "You don't look so bad." Bang, shot him right in the back. And that's what paralyzed him. And then he fled through the cars, jumped out the back of the train, into the darkness of the tunnels and disappeared, and all of a sudden, he was lionized, he was a hero. What you saw was a silhouette on the front pages of the newspapers of America, everybody wanted to know where was this subway gunman? Because he had fought back, he represented everyone out there who had been victimized, who had been taunted, who had been humiliated, who themselves had been emasculated, and he was on the lam. (uptempo instrumental) - [Reporter] From WNBCT TV, this is News For New York. - [Anchorwoman] Police are calling the gunman a vigilante, they say that he methodically shot four young men on a crowded Seventh Avenue IRT Express just north of Chambers Street in Manhattan. The gunman said he shot them because they were trying to rob him, Rolanda Watts has more. (first responders radio chatter) - [Rolanda] New York City police are calling this the most serious subway crime this year. Four men, 18 and 19 years old, shot by a gunman who is still at large. A gunman who police say, told the conductor of the southbound number two train that the four victims were trying to mug him and that's why he shot them. Police say the gunman then fled the train using the subway tracks as his escape route. The gunman is described as a white man in his late 30s, blonde hair, wearing glasses, and neatly dressed in a gray sweater and blue jacket. Two of his victims are in critical condition tonight, suffering from gunshot wounds in the chest. The other two shot in the back are in serious condition. Police say they did find several sharpened screwdrivers in the coat pockets of the victims, screwdrivers sometimes used as weapons or theft tools. Mayor Koch was among those attending tonight's press conference. - It came down to simply because the uniqueness of the situation involving four people being shot in this incident. - This particular incident also brings to light that some citizens are carrying weapons to protect themselves just in case there's trouble. And while that's comforting to some, others are concerned. - If I had more bullets, I would've shot 'em all again and again, my problem was I ran out of bullets. And I was gonna gouge one of the guy's eyes out with my keys afterwards, you can't understand this. I know you can't understand this, that's fine. - But we stood firm for Goetz, we fought for his right to fight back, and even though, it turns out he was titched, and (foreign language), and he would chase squirrels in the park, has he ever gotten into trouble again? No, he rides the subways to this day. And people recognize him, and a lot of people run away 'cause they think he's the subway gunman. He's harmless but in that moment, he became infamous as the subway rider who finally fought back. (rushing train) - I don't think they clean up the streets, I think they're part of the problem. Bunch of vigilantes runnin' around here with no badge whatsoever, if everyone did that, it'd be chaos. - The people down here don't want 'em, they're just, if you get 12 people walkin' down the street all dressed the same, if somebody's going to do a crime, they're gonna see 'em coming, they're gonna wait till they pass, and they're gonna do it anyways. (profane bickering) (crowds verbally altercating) - Ain't none of these motherfuckers ever fucking know what stuff is all about, you get the fuck out of my way, alright? I'm a private citizen, and I got ID and all. Get off me, bud! (crowds clamoring) Oh don't you go taking pictures of me. - Alright, alright. - Call your Angels, here. (dramatic ominous tone resonates) (birds chirping in distance) - Well, well, you wanna know about Curtis. Now, excuse me if I have to think awhile. You know, usually I'm like that, but 91 years old now. - You're 92, 92, today you're 92. That's already done, here. - But you don't have the seeds or anything. - We'll add one, don't worry. - Okay, get ready. - Okay, ready. - One, two, three. (group sings Happy Birthday) (applauding and cheering) (whistling and applauding) - So now what we wanna do is make a wish. Let's everybody make a wish, okay? And wish something really great, you too, mom. Okay, this is a really strong wish. Now you gotta blow the candles out so the wish happens. - Yay! (cheering) - Alright, I was born in Chicago, her first child. (chuckling) And I always wanted a baby brother so I would ask my mother constantly from the moment I could speak, please can I have a baby brother? And then finally, my mother got pregnant. And I was at Ursuline Academy, and the day that he was born, I went to the nuns, it was in the Bronx, and I said, my brother is born. They said, "How do you know it's a brother?" 'Cause at that time, they didn't do the checking. I said, I know it's a brother and he's born. They said, "Uh-uh, he's not born yet, we know this." Sure enough, (clicks tongue) as soon as I nailed it he was born, and the interesting thing is that I was going to school in the Bronx. It was the the Ursuline Nuns in the Bronx and they took him right after he was christened, and placed him on the altar at Ursuline Academy in the church and dedicated him to helping mankind. My mom was always instrumental in helping Curtis, she'd always jump in there, she did the PR for the Guardian Angels, she was wearing white. And she was always Mama Angel, and she was helping all the angels, they would come into the house, and my father was there, and she was like the mother to many of these kids. - Let them see you. - Yeah. - See, he's a Guardian Angel. - Yeah. - He wants to be like his father. - Mm-hmm. - Are you proud of your dad, Anthony? - Yes, I am, very much. - Can you tell us why? - 'Cause he's a hard-working dad, he's a hard-working dad and everything. - Okay, this is good, this is good. - This is a good one, okay. - Faster, faster, out. - So, this is my mom's room, and obviously, when my dad was alive, he was here. And this is their shrine to democrats, to liberals, and to progressives, because they have a picture up of Barack Obama, Jesus Christ, the Pope, other iconic figures in Roman Catholic faith. And this is where they would pray, and they would have sort of quiet contemplative thought. But you would never see Ronald Reagan up there, or Rudy Giuliani, or Bush '41 or Bush '43, or any Republican. That would be considered a (foreign language). (dramatic instrumental) - Curtis asked me questions about crime, the corruption that's around and everything. And I said we had a great backer for the American Revolution, Edmund Burke. And he wrote this one statement that I always quote, "All it takes for evil to triumph is that good men remain silent and do nothing." And the other thing he said, "The worst kind of tyranny are bad laws," and I constantly hammer that into my children, to understand that when you see a crime or something wrong, you have a right to stop it, to get involved, because most people, they talk about it but are never involved directly. They're afraid to put up, they're afraid to make a commitment. - You know, in the day and age that I grew up in, where everyone was hardened in their views, my dad was a combination of a libertarian and a Unitarian. I know, a libertarian and a Unitarian, because he was open-minded, he had traveled the world as a seaman, he would bring back books, and he would tell me stories of what it was like in all of these exotic locations that I couldn't pronounce, and I couldn't find on a map. And I was just mesmerized, and he had movie star looks. Blonde hair, blue eyes, and he exuded strength. And he told me what it was like, against all odds, that his family had survived the depression in Chicago, and I was able to compare that with my mother's family in Brooklyn that survived depression. But most importantly, he would straighten me out. He wasn't my wartime consigliere, he was my peacetime consigliere. Soon after he was in intensive care, heart failure, all other kinds of problems, and then there came that moment in which our family was gathered around together and we were told he doesn't have long to live. And all of a sudden, he's no longer lucid, he's no longer able to communicate. You can see, he was trembling, he was in such incredible pain, and I said to the doctors, why? Why are we continuing his life, he's suffering. And they said, well, there's an option. We can continue his life but we'll have to break his ribs and give him CPR. (slow music) We can't do this, dad is suffering so much. So I said, let me take over, I'm the medical proxy. And I went in that room and I stared and glared at all the doctors, the physicians, and the nurses. And I said, I know what I gotta do, leave the room. They said, "We can't leave the room." I said, fuckin' leave the room! And I grabbed my father's hand, it was shaking. And I put my mouth right to his ear. And I knew he could hear me, and I said, "Dad, don't worry about it, you can go. "I'll take care of mom, I'll take care of the house. "I promise, you were the greatest father to us, "all three of us, you gave us everything. "You worked overtime, you gave us piano lessons, "martial arts, anything I wanted, "parochial school education, you were there for me "in my time of need, you can go now, dad." And his grip lessened, and he began to breath peacefully. He was no longer in that dire circumstance where I knew it was more mental than it was physical. And I knew where the magnet was because he had a pacemaker, and I knew exactly what I had to do as his son, and I took that magnet, and I waved it over his pacemaker, and it stopped his heart. And he passed on to the hereafter. And I felt the energy leave the body of his being here on this plane, and it almost like it transferred to me, and the staff came back in, and they knew what I had done. And it was hush, hush, mush, mush. And I know a lot of families go through that. And a lot of times, that's exactly what transpires when you have to make a decision, what's in the best interest of your father or your mother. And I know my dad is lookin' down on me and understanding that I carry on the torch. He passed it right on to me, that day, in that bed, in Maimonides, when he drew his last breath. Two people had the biggest influence in my life, both passed away in my arms, my grandfather, Fidel Bianquino at 99, and my father, Chester Sliwa, at 93. (train rushing) (rising ominous music) - I think it's really a question of ego, the male ego, that's what it comes down to, because these, 'cause the Mayor of New York, the Police Commissioner of New York, and as well as many, many, other cities, have told we the people that there is nothing that can be done about the drug problem, that it's too big to control. Do you realize that all across the United States, all summer long, children have not been able to go out of their apartments to play because they're afraid of getting killed in the crossfire of drug dealers. What kind of freedom is that? - It was the mid 80s and it was the time when crack cocaine smashed the city's face, and crack was wack as many people say because the NYPD was a dollar short and a day late, they had never dealt with these kinds of dope fiends. - It's a crack head eatin' a car battery, yeah. And I'm gonna tell ya right now, crack addict say, he's a crack head. (stammering mindlessly) - I mean, before that, those guys were shooting heroin, maybe a little bit of cocaine mixed with the heroin. But at some point, they would drop off, and catch a few Z's. But when these folks suddenly were beaming themselves up to Scotty in a glass pipe, smoking those rocks, they were catatonic, they were going 24/7, 365. They were crime machines to feed their insatiable appetite to smoke this crack, and immediately, the Guardian Angels were pressed into service in the front lines because in a lot of the neighborhoods, the inner-city neighborhoods and especially the Bronx, the cops had basically waved the white flag. They had given up, meantime, what we decided to do was to rob the crack dealers. When we get inside, you're slamming and jamming, asking no questions. Hands on the head, you pass them down beyond the floor. One of you will be scoopin' it up, drugs, money, paraphernalia, we're right outside. We perform our little act, we destroy it, we alert the public, English and Spanish. And then we're on our way, we don't have time to play. So, are we ready? - Let's go. - Are we bricks? (chanting in agreement) - Alright. - Yeah, yeah! (chaotic yelling) - I'm gonna fuck you up! - Get up, get off me! (chaotic yelling) - What were you doin' in that building? What are you doin' in this building? You're smoking crack, you're selling crack, and you're hookin'. (uptempo music) You know how many complaints we've had about this building from the people in this community? They're tired of seeing this crap go on. They're tired of seeing crack, crime, and hookin' goin' on. Somehow, they sniffed out that we were in the area doing recon, and this time when I called upon the raid to take place, we were entrapped, we were surrounded, the drug dealers were shooting off their guns, the muscle heads were outside, they were flexing. Got into the back of the truck, and as we tried to make our getaway, guys and gals were coming at us with bats and pipes, and sticks, and hatchets, meantime, the cops were a few blocks away, they're spectating, they're waiting to see if the Guardian Angels are gonna have to be carried out on gurneys, if they're gonna have to send in the meat wagons. Luckily, we were able to get outta there as the shots continued to be fired from the rooftops, we would stop at certain sections and which we would see a huge gathering of young people. We would step into the streets, we would empty the drugs out of the fanny packs, the money on the street. We would count the money up, and bundle it, and we would destroy the drugs in front of all the young people and put it down the sewers. - This is what the children of America dying for. No, this is what the people of America kill for. You know this is what's destroying our nation, crack cocaine and blow, you know, I don't want you doing this. (chanting crowds) Right here is the main reason that the Guardian Angels do what we do. This is our future, alright, when we leave drugs this way, maybe this damn country have a chance. - And naturally they were aghast, they couldn't believe this, we're talking about thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of narcotics of all time, mostly crack and heroin, and a lot of currency, and we would bundle it up. And we would bring it back to Restaurant Row, where we began our Crackdown on Crack near the Great White Way, Broadway, when we liberated Times Square from the menace of the crack dealers and the crack users. And there was a Lutheran Church which had the largest soup kitchen in Manhattan at that time, and we would hand it over to the pastor, Pastor Hanson, who was in charge. And his assistant, who else can say in 37 years, walking amongst the Uzi-toting, dope-sucking psychopathic killing machines, physically getting involved, not just being eyes and ears, which, you know, see something, say something, that's good if you wanna be passive, but if you wanna be proactive, and aggressive, and deter crime, there's gotta be a little bit of oomph in terms of what you do. Only one lawsuit, six Guardian Angels shot and killed in the line of duty, 36 seriously injured including myself, and when you look at the other ledger, who's been seriously injured, who's been killed, who's been maimed? I think the ledger suggests that we've maintained quality control to the best of our ability. (uptempo funky music) (ominous music) I decided, okay, I don't have every fact but I'm gonna talk about the murder that John Gotti did, that would get him triple life without parole that nobody had ever talked about publicly. It had been related to me by my cousin, Butchie. Hey, he was a lush, you know, he liked the booze. He had been at the Silver Fox which was a combination gin mill and dance hall in South Ozone Park. And who rolls in that night, as a lot of the young ladies and men are on the dance floor, but Gotti and his crew. There was Rogerio, there was McClaughlin, Caplin, a whole crew, and they were lookin' for Danny D'Silva. Because Danny D'Silva they had given a kilo of cocaine on consignment and they surrounded him, and Gotta Jr. says, "Hey, Danny, we've been lookin' for you, where's our snaps? Where's our moola-shmoola?" (dramatic music) And Danny said, "Fuck you, Gotti." Now, this is in front of all of his guys. 'Cause naturally, he's dancin' with his woman. So, Gotti gets a shiv from Rogerio who sticks it into the back of his hand, and he now stabs him 46 times, he holds him up, keeps stabbing him as his homeboys hold him up, and then, when he's laying on the ground, he's stabbing him over, and over, and over in a psychotic rage, he has to be dragged away and taken back to his father's social club on 101st Avenue, the Burgen Hunt, Fish, and Shooting Human Beings Club. And then these guys tell, "Hey, your son just killed this guy on the floor there, the dance floor." And Gotti says, "Don't worry about it. Everybody knows they didn't see nothin'." So, guess what? The DT's come and he starts asking questions. And nobody saw nothin', oh, Gotti was here, I didn't know. What, the Gambino's, ah, what are you talking about? Eh, the guy must have fell on a knife, what, 46 times? Yeah. And then from the crowd emerges Danny D'Silva's best friend and he says, "I know what happened, officers." "Well, come with us," he goes to the precinct and he says, "John Gotti Jr. stabbed my friend 46 times. He murdered him," the call goes up to the Queens District Attorney, John Santucci. And all of sudden, he says, "Gotti, you got a problem. I've got good evidence here that your son killed Danny D'Silva, do what you gotta do because if not, I'm gonna have to charge him and he's gonna get arraigned." So, Gotti Senior says, "No problem. Thank for the heads up," a few days later, this guy is found hanging from a tree, strung by his neck but his knees were touchin' the sidewalk in Ozone Park. A clear signal to everyone, he didn't hang himself. He was killed and then hung out to dry. A message that everyone, hush, hush, mush, mush. Meantime, the coroner comes and says it was a suicide. Really, how much did the coroner get greased? And so, Gotti Senior figured that that chapter was put to rest until Curtis Sliwa told a story that day, and that began the road to the decision that by all means necessary, they were gonna wack and kill Curtis Sliwa to silence me and have me swimmin' with the fishes in Jamaica Bay. (dramatic music) - Well, the hunt is on tonight and Mayor Dinkins is pledging his help to find the gunman that ambushed and shot Curtis Sliwa, the Guardian Angels founder and leader is recovering from surgery at Bellevue Hospital tonight. Magee Hickey is there now with a live report for us. Magee? - Chuck, Curtis Sliwa is still in critical condition at this hour after undergoing more than six hours of surgery to remove five bullets, he's expected to recover fully from his injuries in a shooting that took place this morning at exactly the same place where he'd been attacked by three men with baseball bats two months earlier. It happened just after 5:00 AM, near this news stand at Seventh Street and Avenue A, Curtis Sliwa told police he had just gotten into this cab to head to his morning radio show when he was shot five times in the thigh and lower abdomen by someone he said was crouching in the front seat. - He jumped out the window to get away. He's got the scrapes and bruises on the side of his leg. - Had this bullet gone, I would say approximately one inch higher, he might've been paralyzed for life. - They're out to get him, he was set up. This was not the first time he's been put upon. Several weeks ago, he was attacked by fellas wielding bats. - Later, police determined the cab had been stolen the day before. Police say Sliwa's two white assailants switched into a white town car, a few blocks from the shooting. - I admire Curtis Sliwa and I think he places his life into his own hands doing what he does. - I just hope everything works out for him, and that his work continues because it's not easy, what he does, and the city needs more people involved, and people doing things. (fading into ominous tone) - So, I'm laid out on the asphalt on the corner of Avenue B and Sixth Street, after being shot multiple times, diving out of that cab. The original plan was, they would shoot me up, I would bleed out, they would drive me over the Williamsburg Bridge, they would chemically incinerate me at one of their chop shops and junkyards. And all of a sudden there would be no evidence. Not of any of my DNA anywhere. Well, there was a problem, I decided to thwart that plan even though I didn't know what the ultimate goal was and dive out of the car after being shot multiple times. And as they stripped me of my clothes, the EMT's and put me in the body bag, and pumped it up with a bicycle pump to try to repress the bleeding, and it felt like a baby grand piano had been rested on my breastplate, and I'm screaming in pain in the middle of the street, and it's attracting more and more people, and they throw me on the gurney, and they race me to Bellevue Hospital. And we must've hit every pothole on the way to Bellevue because I could feel my blood slushing in the body bag. And I'm thinking to myself, hey, God, as my judge, I'm too young to go, c'mon, man! I got so much more to do, I can't die this way, at the hands of my enemies, please, give me another shot! But God wasn't listening, the guy that was listening was Dr. Leon Pachter 'cause as they wheeled me into the ER, as they were already getting the scalpel and cutting the first slice into me because they had to operate El rapido because I was expiring quickly. Dr. Leon Pachter, amazingly, all roads lead to Canarsie. Born and raised in Canarsie, whispered in my ear, he says, "Curtis, we got your back." So, the machine is keeping me alive. They're monitoring my vital signs. I'm slowly coming out of, well, being in a deep, deep, deep, REM sleep, something I've never had before. And all of a sudden, as I look to my left, I see the image of the former mayor of the city of New York, Ed Koch, who had been my lifelong enemy, my nemesis, who had called us vigilantes, who had made my life (foreign language), who led to me being arrested 76 times on his orders. And there he is, he's smiling at me. And I said to myself, this is it. I must've gone straight to hell without an asbestos suit and here he is, it's Lucifer welcoming me into the furnace. He was there to suddenly say, you know something? Let bygones be bygones, if anything, the Guardian Angels are like chicken soup when you have a cold, it certainly can't hurt, it can only help. - With the passage of time, everybody accommodates, and they reach a point where people, including the cops who perceive them as positive. - They tried to get me twice, two times up, two times they failed, I got a lot more in me. I got a lot more life in me, and I've got a lot more to accomplish on this plane before I cash in my ticket. - Curtis Sliwa has been showed photos of about 15 members of young Gotti's crew. If there is any validity to this theory, why would the son of a powerful mob boss take out a contract on the high-profile leader of the Guardian Angels? (suspenseful instrumental) - Right now, the interesting thing is that they tell the whole story of when they wanted to kill Curtis Sliwa, so, John, today, how do you feel sitting next to Curtis? - Well, I don't blame him. Obviously, if guys are trying to kill him, and hurt him, and I'm part of that Gambino family, I would feel the same way as him. (suspenseful music) - Where's that Gotti Jr. now, John White? - Well, tellin' tales still, he won't apologize to Curtis. And he's still free, he's free, he's runnin' around, he's scared to come into the neighborhood, he won't go to any of the Boroughs and he knows guys will hurt him or kill him. So he's hiding behind his attorney. And still spinning tales instead of being a man and apologizing to this man sitting next to me. I'm actually denouncing that life. And I'm out running around trying to tell kids, follow Curtis, follow guys like yourself, and become men. - So what do you feel sitting opposite this guy? - The fact that he testified in the fourth trial against John Gotti Jr., hoped to put him away, he's trying to square the deal. In terms of will I ever shake his hand? Hell no, if he slips and falls and breaks his neck in the bathroom, God's done justice. (dramatic music) - [Interviewer] Set the record straight, John. Were you responsible for his shooting? - [John] No, Sliwa was a situation that was very unique. Sliwa was somebody that he hoped, he prayed, he needed the guys to shoot him, that's what he needed. Because he wanted to build a career out of it. He was a nobody and nobody paid attention to him. But once that had happened to him, once he had gotten shot, okay? He turned around, turns this great radio career, making half a million dollars a year, and he became a bit of a media darling, you know. The fact that he's irritated every entity in New York City throughout his career really was of little nada but the fact that he cashed in on the accusations the Gotti's had him kidnapped and shot, well, that's a little different. (heartfelt music) - Nothing compares to the love that I have for this city of New York that birthed me. My baptism in fire was in the city of New York. I'm a Borough boy, I'm not a Manhattan guy. I can relate to average, everyday people and the struggles that they go through. And I hope as I continue to be humble, that I maintain that love. - I love that he gives to New York City, and he's there for the people. And anytime he has a problem with any issues that's going on, he attacks it instead of trying to put it under the cover and sheets and stuff, and he's there for the community no matter what ethnicity you are. And he's the truth. - Been in the Angels since 1986, first time that I saw the Guardian Angels, I was on the Four Train, had a lady getting attacked on the train and nobody would help. The only person that was helping this lady was Guardian Angels. - I like what he's for. Servin' us. - I'm goin' on 26 years now of bein' a member of the New York City Guardian Angels and one of the reasons why I joined in this organization was to make a difference in the community and help those that can't help themselves. - I remember them from back in the day. C'mon, you gotta jump in on this one. 'Cause we knew them when, 'cause we're old. C'mon, Ed. - I joined in 1982. I was 18-years-old, I'm 52 years old right now. The Guardian Angels have been everything to me. Curtis has been a great role model. I didn't have a father when I was younger so I always looked up to him. - I wake up 4:30 in the morning and you know, me and my family, we watch him or go to work, my grandma loves him especially. I don't know his name but he says some funny things. I see a lot of the people in the subway too. - It's preparing me for the future. I wanna be in law enforcement, so this is kind of, a step, it's a process, it's getting me more used to what I have to do in the future, what I want to do in the future. - I was raised in the projects of East Harlem. If I would have never join the Guardian Angels, who knows where I would be today. (crowds bustling) Curtis Sliwa, man. (upbeat music) - We have to justify the time that we were allowed on this earth, what did you stand for, what did you do, what did you contribute? Not to the demise of others but to the support and maintenance, and to the enlightenment, and the enrichment of others, that's how you're gonna be defined, I hope that's how I get defined. And I know the millennials, I have faith in them. I have faith in all people, will actually leave a better mark on society than my baby boomer generation did. And nowadays, what I'm most fearful of is that I haven't done enough. I have so much more that I'm capable of doing. You can say, "What are you talking about? You're approaching retirement." I say, retirement, the only retirement I'm gonna have is when I'm room temperature, are you kidding, I'm gonna work till the day that I die, on this, what I'm most passionate about, the Guardian Angel principles and concepts, which are global and local. When all of a sudden it's my time to take a dirt bath then boy, I will be wrestling the grim reaper, as I have on many previous occasions. When I'm six feet under, in a pine box, or at the rate I'm goin fiscally, it'll be a cardboard box, it may be potter's field, I hope it says one thing on my tombstone. RIP, he tried, he died, because I certainly gave it my all. (uptempo music) (alt-rock music)
