This is Lima Mike calling Delta Charlie. Lima Mike calling Delta Charlie. Lima Mike calling Delta Charlie. Do you read me? Do you read me? Over. Lima Mike, this is Delta Charlie. I read you five and nine. Over. Okay Pete, I've got you. I've got you. Over. Okay. We're on course over Eagle's Nest. Sorry for the delay. Over. What went wrong, Pete? You're two hours late. Over. Some joker knew what we had on board. Maybe he just didn't like us. He put a squib behind the radio. The detonator went off, but the charge didn't blow. Over. Is anybody hurt, Pete? Is anybody hurt? Over. Negative. We're all okay. Only the radio was damaged. You can relax. Over. Okay. How does she fly, Pete? Over. Like an angel. And we got a boy scout with us now. An Air Force plane joined us a few minutes ago. Barranquilla must have radioed for an escort to see us in. Over. Were you alerted about that, Pete? What kind of plane? What kind of plane? Over. An old Mustang, fitted with wing tanks. She's genuine alright. Over. Okay then. Let me speak to Caroline. Over. Will do. Hello, darling. Sorry for the delay. We didn't mean to frighten you. Over. Thank God we got you out of that hell hole. Are you really okay? Over. Yes, Scott's even asleep. The bastard's diving on us! Jesus! Pete? Pete, can you hear me? Pete, can you hear me? Over. Pete, can you hear me? Pete, can you hear me? Delta Charlie, come in! Come in, Pete! Over! Fill her up? You think you can stand the pace around here? Not much happens around here Sunday. Not much happens around here any time. -You buy used cars? -Some. How about this one? You'd have to ask the boss. You'll have to come back Monday. -Bourbon. -You'll have to think again, mister. Again? No hard liquor served on Sunday. There's no one awake between here and the gulf. Who's gonna bust you? Rule of the Parish. No hard liquor. I'm not from this Parish. Look, I'm just driving through this clammy swamp you call a State and I want a drink. How about a beer? Nice, cold beer? I said bourbon. Now look, just wait a darn minute here! You can't come back... Look, we don't allow anybody back here. You're gonna have to get on out here in the front... This isn't New York City, kid. How much for the bottle? Seven dollars and thirty cents. Get me something to eat with the change. Thank you. Yes sir. Car 23. Go to Johnny's Country Bar. Single, forty. Disorderly person. -Ten-four. You giving Wylie a bad time, shoe pick? You asking me or you telling me? If you're looking for a rough time, you came to the right place. I was told that nothing much happens here on Sunday. Okay, mister. Let's see some ID. He's got my gun in there! Take it easy, kid. Take it easy. It's Sunday… Attaboy! Self-defense? That's right. The Law Officers, you would claim, attacked you? Well, they made all the moves. Why, I wonder, is one of you attackers now in a hospital… with 16 stitches and a fractured jaw? When a man reaches for his gun in this neighborhood, I got to think he means business. Well, you were in possession of a gun yourself. All I was reaching for was my Social Security card. Which was false. As was your driver's license. False or stolen. You are truculent, insolent, and a man of violence. I could already commit you for assault and battery, for possession of false documents, and a stolen automobile. -But I won't. -Thanks. I won't because, compared to what other agencies want you for, our mild charges seem almost inconsequential. We've done some checking on you, Mr. Talbot. Police investigations even go beyond this country. Through Interpol, overseas. "John Montague Talbot, worked as an underwater salvage expert. While engaged in salvage work in the North Sea in June 1970, you disappeared." So, apparently, did some salvaged gem stones. "Subsequently arrested in Amsterdam, September 1970, escaped… by killing an unarmed policeman!" Now, you might think you're in Hicksville, USA, Mr. Talbot, but you will regret the day that you dropped in on us. You shall be transferred to the custody of the New Orleans Police Department to await further inquiries and possible extradition charges. Don't! Give us the gun. One more step and you're dead! Lose it! Sit! You won't get ten yards. Okay you, you're the pigeon. Talbot, let her go! You're putting her life in danger! I'm not, but anybody who comes after me is. No, please! Smart, smart, smart! -Hey! -Hold on! What kind of a guy would do a thing like that? Why don't you let me go? You don't need me anymore! Please let me go! You're my insurance. Hey, this might be him! It's a dead end! Aw, look at that! He's getting clean away. -We'll need a tow truck for this. -Damnit! You could've killed us! That's right. Just remember that. Don't you make a move. What the hell are you trying to do down there? You trying to kill yourself? I'm really sorry cap', but it's an emergency. My wife's sick and I gotta get her across. One more crazy jump like that and you'll be dead! Forgive me, huh? Put out a call, quick! You're mad! You have to be insane! I've got nothing to lose. Be with you in a moment. -Two coffees, no cream. -Two coffees, no cream? -Thank you. -You're welcome. …Stand by. Move. Get over here! You're very brave with a gun, aren't you? I'm gonna turn you in. I don't care what you do. Oh. Okay. First, I'll kill the fat one. Then I'll get the other one while he's trying to figure out how to hit me without getting you. Yes, you'd do it, wouldn't you? Try me. I hate you so much, it scares me. You stay scared and you'll stay alive. You just stay right here. Out. Come on! What are you gonna do here? Get away from it all. -Quiet, honey, quiet and we got him. Right, let me have your gun. Well, there I was, eating fried chicken in a Louisiana drive-in in the middle of nowhere. Proud possessor of ten bucks and an unpaid car. Listening to the radio talking about this guy who killed a cop, but mainly wondering how I was gonna get out of this place and suddenly, jackpot! The cop killer parks right next to me. The officer was killed? Yep. Left a wife and a little girl. Well, that should make your jackpot bigger. My mind was going along those very same lines. What are you talking about? He's talking about bread. Reward. For services rendered to the society. How did you recognize me? I didn't. You picked a face that's well known in these parts. This is Miss Sarah Ruthven. Daughter of Alexander Ruthven. Spelt O-I-L. All those oil rigs out in the gulf, they belong to daddy. Yeah, you can always tell class. Sit down. Or I'll belt you. Yeah, you'd do it, wouldn't you? -What's your name? -Jablonsky, miss. Herman Jablonsky, of no appreciable assets, but lots of high hopes. I really think we should contact the police. There must be a phone here somewhere There's no need to panic, miss. I don't think the police were included in his plan. I don't think you understand. My father'll be very grateful. Of course he will, honey, but I'd rather have him tell me how grateful he is now. While I still have the option of leaving you with this guy, this killer here. Okay. Let's go phone daddy. See if blood is thicker than oil. Ah, you can almost smell it. Smell what? Money. -Cut the engine. Well, that has to be daddy, right on cue. Okay, this is where we get off. We had a deal. There are no police, as we agreed. There are people. Oh, staff… and guests. Guests? Colleagues. You and me, Ruthven, we had a deal. There's a lot of sentimental value riding on this daughter. I'm gonna collect every cent of it. We have an agreement and I will honor it. Yeah. A guy like you can afford to be honest. Okay, one daughter. Special delivery. Are you sure you're all right? Perhaps it'll be best if you went up to your room while we finish this business. In here, gentlemen. Well, hard cash would be even nicer but it does make everything seem… -Worthwhile. -Good. Good. Well… Perhaps then, we should discuss this other check? And what's the catch? I mean, I like it, but what's the catch? The State of Louisiana has offered a reward for Talbot. This is to reimburse you for leaving Talbot with us. I'm very flattered. Now why is that? I think you'll be very useful to us. You want a cop killed? You have other skills. Nah, I think I'll turn him in. Keep everything legal. Come on, buddy boy. Guys like me get locked up so that citizens like him can run to the bank safely. And the sooner the better! So, shall we? That was very foolish, Talbot. We have a proposition for you. -What kind of proposition? -A very attractive one. Your life. Why is this man still here? Let's just say that I'm a house guest. Wait! That's for today. In there. And no more of that hero stuff. As I was saying, you got your daughter back, you can do what you want with Talbot. So I'll just take that other check and tag all along. And I'll just hold the phone, Jablonsky. How do you know me? You're a cop. Ex-cop. Ex-lieutenant, New York Narcotics. Until you got greedy, and careless. And they let you out, before your time, didn't they? Paroled, I kept my nose clean. Well, that does change things, doesn't it? Herman, we want you to stay for a day or two and guard Talbot. Don't give me that stuff, Vyland. I know that kid upstairs. Larry what's-his-name. He was busted two years ago. Him too I know. Royale. With the eyes. He's a hitman. You need another guard around here like Ruthven needs another oil rig. We can't risk the news getting out that Talbot's here. Well, the check buys my silence. But not my peace of mind. I think you should stay. What's the alternative? Quick trip to the bottom of the gulf with a pair of concrete socks? I accept. I thought you would. First door. -You got a reprieve, fella. -But not from you. Oh, you see that? I didn't beat all of his brains out… yet. I'll keep Talbot outa your hair, Royale. He's my baby now. I got a big investment in you and I'm gonna make it plain to you that I don't want you to screw it up. -Now get in there, you cocky bastard. Now, let that be a warning to you. Don't ever try that stuff on me again. Okay Talbot, let's go. Your presence is requested downstairs. Come one, move it! Hey! Good morning. I hope you've had a comfortable night. Now, as to why you're here. You specialize in deep-water salvage. We're looking for something, Talbot. Something deep. How deep? Twelve hundred feet. Twelve? No, not in these waters, no. What we're after is at the bottom of a deep hole in the sea bed. I know it's none of my business, but… you could tell me what's down there? Let's say we're treasure hunting. For something that deep… you'd need some pretty fancy equipment. What do you know about the Fathom? -The Fathom? You mean the Bathyscaphe? -Hmm hmm. I know a little bit about her. You see, I worked on her once out of Honduras. Yeah, we know that. We checked. Oh? Well, with the Fathom, there'd be no problem. As a matter of fact, my outfit did her first test dives at over two thousand feet. They tell me she broke her hawser and… they lost her. So they did. -It's all clear. -Okay, I'm going now. -I think you're crazy. -No, it's the only way. -Take care, laddie. -Okay, I'll be back before sunrise. And don't wait up for me. Over here! -You all right? -Yeah, I'm alive. Did you have any luck? I think we've found what rig they're using, so let's go. Okay. Now you just sleep nice and quiet and don't make a nuisance of yourself. Understand what I mean? Good, I thought you would. Nighty-night, then! Sweet dreams! Yeah, that should be the X-12 right there. Now how long do you think it'll take to get there? We'll be able to make it in about… maybe forty minutes. Good. You think you're okay? Yes, sure. I checked it all out. -Is this as close as we can get? -Yes, without being seen. Well, if I'm gonna find what we're looking for, I'm gonna need some time. Not too long, could be a storm coming. That'll help. He's handcuffed to the bed. Come. -Come? Come where? -Just a little talk. Won't take long. I didn't say she was beautiful. Did I say she was beautiful? I say she was prehistoric. Jesus, she's like something they just thawed out! All of a sudden you got taste! Three weeks on this frigging… Is there a fire, for Chrissakes? Let's see what the hell is going on. If this is another one of their lousy fire drills… Okay, hurry it up! -But I'm sure I saw something. -So, get on with it now. -I could have sworn there was... -Larry! Okay, get the hell in! Don't scream! Don't scream and don't move. Now, just concentrate on that, don't you move! I know you're frightened of me, but don't scream and don't move. Can you understand that? Listen to me, I am not going to hurt you. I am not going to attack you. If they find me out of my room, I'm dead. If you make one sound, they'll kill me. Now, do you understand the chance I'm taking? Now, listen to me. Everything, everything that happened up to now, outside of a bar-room brawl to get me into court, was fixed. That's right, everything was set up. The break from the court room, your kidnapping, it was all set up to get me here. It was arranged. Arranged with a handful of people. The deputy. The deputy that I supposedly killed. All he has to show for that, is a powder burn from a blank cartridge. You didn't see any blood, did you? Because there wasn't any blood. I'm gonna take away my hand. Now, if you scream, I'm dead. I'm taking a chance now. I don't believe you. Judge Mollison. Judge Mollison asked you to come to court, didn't he? He even sent a car to make sure you'd show. Yes, but you almost killed me! I… I had to rough you up, I know. I had to get away, but I had to make it look good. We couldn't organize the entire State! Now think, Sarah. The cars with the convenient keys, everything was set up to get me here on the inside. Me and Jablonsky. Who are you? Look, my name is John Talbot. The only crime I ever committed was staying over time at a parking meter. It was rigged, it was all rigged! Look, I'm not handcuffed to a bedpost with Jablonsky's gun at my head, am I? Then what the hell am I doing here, telling you all this? Why are you? Because they've killed Jablonsky. I don't understand. What's going on in this house? Just listen… Now, your father made what he thought was a profitable business speculation. He was using his money for a stake in a salvage operation. Only he didn't know Vyland and the company he keeps! Look, he's in over his head. He's in danger, Sarah, and so are you! Why are you here? All I can tell you is this, I've got a job to do. Now, if I can get through tonight, I'll need someone that I can trust. You gotta believe that I'm on the side of the angels. I'm counting on you. Huh? Thanks friend. Wake up, Mister Talbot. On your feet. Where's Jablonsky? We paid him off. He left. You do that one more time and I'm gonna work you over. Okay. Okay, let's get one thing straight now, kid. You see, I'm the guy with the answers out there, in the gulf. So there's no way you're gonna use that noise on me. No way. Okay, easy does it. It appears Mr. Talbot is indispensable… for the moment. It's Vyland. I think you know what this is. Yeah, I know what it is. Its… It's the Fathom, or a twin. -That's right. -What about it? She's here. Here? That's one of the support legs of this rig, but it happens to be raised twenty feet above sea bed. The 'scaphe is moored below that. Some operation here. -It is. -You must be here for a very big prize. Now, here's the deal… you get this Fathom to work for us, and we'll forget everything that's happened. We'll see that you get to South America, with a new passport and some money in your pocket. Now, what do you say? I'd… I'd say I need a guarantee. You don't have any choice, Talbot. All you have to do, is check out the wires and make sure this thing runs. I guess I'll… I guess I have to take a shot at it, won't I? Here, you carry the tools, will you, Sonny? Let's take a look at your shiny new toy! In case you were thinking of leaving us, Fathom can only be released from up here. What, leave and ruin our beautiful friendship? Talbot? -Talbot? -Yeah? It's five o'clock. What's happening. We've got a lot of problems here. You took Fathom when they were fitting her out, right? -That's right. -They didn't quite finish. It's gonna take a little time to unravel this mess. Can you fix it? -You gotta fix it! -What do you plan on replacing me with? How long will you need? I'd say… a few hours at least. All right. We'll be with Ruthven. I'm going to... Talbot needs more time. It's going well, though. We'll just have to be patient. Where is there to go, Miss Ruthven? Anywhere where you aren't. And how are your nerves? You came into this with open eyes, Ruthven. And we're nearly there. Stay cool and no harm will come to any of us. -Where's Vyland? -What's the trouble? Just get me to him, there may be a pressure blow down there! They were all out of business. Come on, man! I'm gonna kill you, Talbot! Is there any sign? What's the matter… They don't mean a thing here. Changes all the time. Wind's dropped five knots, but it could do anything out there. This wind could blow for three more minutes or three more days. Hey, easy! You'll start to develop a taste for violence. It's not hard around you. Car 19 to headquarters. This is car 19 to headquarters. Do you read me? Over. This is car 19 to headquarters, car 19 to headquarters. Do you read me? Over. Car 19, this is headquarters. Go ahead. All systems go. I've got the Fathom working and I'm taking her down now. Wait, we can't make it out to you because of the storm. We can't get through. We managed to put four men aboard this morning, but it may not be enough. It's got to be. I can't stall out. If they take a roll call, I've had it. Over. Look, you've gotta stall! Maybe when the storm drops, we'll risk the choppers. Don't blow it! You gotta wait. You must wait! Now you listen to me. You wait! I've waited for this moment for three years! For three years I've waited for this! Hey, thank you. Thanks for everything. Royale! Where is everyone? I've been trying to radio you, there's no one up here. Larry's not here now. Yeah, so? So… have you made out? Can you fix it? All systems go. Tell Vyland. Tell him we're ready. Okay. -You comfortable, Royale? -Sure. Yellow section… If everything works, this should start it. Engines on. Are you ready? Ready. Release lock. We've just cleared the leg. You'd better give me those directions before we sink into that mud. Yeah. "Almost due south-west 222 degrees." Due south-west 222 degrees. Keep reading. -When do we get to that chasm? -Pretty soon. About two thirds of the way. Whose calculations are these? We had an engineer work it all out. Do we pass him on the way? Just a minute, friend. We've gone 330 meters. Shouldn't we be going down? Mm-mm, no, not yet. All we need to do is scrape a coral bank, one split tank screws up our buoyancy and… we never come up again. Then do it your own way. That's what you're here for. Thanks. Go to singles. Three sixty-two… Three sixty-three… Three sixty-five… Three sixty-six… Bottom! Ruthven here! That's the last of them. That just leaves the two with Talbot. Oh my god. Look at that. Just look at that! Isn't that something? We're lucky, Royale, it wasn't scattered all over sea bed. -Worth waiting for? -Worth waiting for. What we're after, Talbot, is in the rear cargo area… there's a door... On the port side, behind the wing. You know your Dakotas. Yeah. Yeah, I know my Dakotas. It's big, Talbot, and it's packed in four crates. Three of gold bars, one of emerald and uncut diamonds. Total value, 85 million dollars. How do you know all this? What are you doing? I've just cut of the oxygen. I've instituted a reverse air flow. The air is now being sucked out. In about six minutes, we start to die. What are you talking about? I'm talking about not being able to breathe. I'm talking about turning purple. I'm talking about screaming your lungs out before your heart stops. We aren't stuck. You'll never get the right sequence. What kind of a joke is this. No joke. I rewired the circuits. Wait! Now, if that's true, you die too. Yeah, that's right. Come on, Talbot, I know what you want. You want a bigger piece! All right, you got it! Thanks… That shipment was due from Columbia to the International Monetary Fund. Payment for arms. There's a revolution going on, so the peso was shaky. Fix the circuits, Talbot! They hired an obscure airline. Mine. Only that plane never got there because a few other people knew what was on that flight. So they just shot it out of the sky. Who the hell are you, anyway? The one on the left is my brother. The one on the right… is my wife. And somewhere in there… is a very small boy… three years old… my son. You see, I've waited for this moment for three years. I don't believe there have been five consecutive minutes during that time that I've ever thought of anything else. What do you want, Talbot? What do you want? I've decided… that I'm gonna stay here… with some people… with some people that I love. I… I don't like the idea of you two being here with me, but in a way, it's kind of appropriate. The killers… and the victims, all together in the end. Crazy son of a bitch, you're out of your mind! I asked you what do you want. What the hell do you want? We're stuck here… forever. What was that? Air pollution warning. It's gonna get a little painful now. Who's the man in charge? Who's responsible for shooting down that plane? Is… is that the deal? If I tell you… will you turn on the oxygen? Talk. I can feel my throat and lungs… starting to hurt a little now. You can probably feel yours. The blue is starting under your eyes. Look at your hands, Vyland. They're turning blue. Royale… all right, Talbot. All right. I did it. It was me. Now turn on the oxygen. I did it. Turn on the oxygen. Who killed Jablonsky? I told you I did it. Now turn on the oxygen, Talbot! Who killed Jablonsky? Tell him, for Christ's sake Royale! -I tell him nothing. -Tell him! -Tell him! -Look at the window, Talbot. Those are just bones out there… not people. What do you wanna do? Burn yourself with them? That won't bring them back. The millions of dollars… Talbot… Millions… Tell him! Tell him! Tell him! -Tell him! You've got thirty… thirty seconds. Nothing. Talk! Say it! I killed… I killed… I killed… I'm coming up. I'm coming up.
