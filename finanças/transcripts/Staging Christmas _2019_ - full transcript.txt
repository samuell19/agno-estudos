Great. Yeah, I'm just grabbing coffee, and then I'll be right in. Thanks, bye. - Hey. - Hi. - Usual? - Yes, two today, please. These christmas decorations are new. - Yeah, new company policy. - Two lattes comin' up! These garlands are beautiful. Super high quality. Do you know where you got them from? I don't. They were just in a box when I got to work. Beautiful. They're really pretty. Yeah, I guess. [laughs] sorry. Christmas decorating is a big part of my job. Oh, I thought you were just unusually into garlands. That too. Don't even get me started on how many different kinds of tinsel there is. Don't worry, I won't. Thanks for the coffee. Always. Have a jolly day. - You too. Bye. - Thank you. Bye. Next. Hi! - It's looking great in here. - Thanks. - Here, I got this for you. - Oh, thank you. King roasters. It's my favorite. I know how daunting the first week in a new job can be, and I just want you to know you're doing a terrific job. Lots to learn, but really liking it all so far. Well, let's finish fixing it up. Sure. Okay, how is the wreath delivery going? Good. They just hit some traffic on their way down the mountain. Okay, then let's push back the client viewing. But everything's looking really great. I mean, I doubt they'll notice a couple of wreaths missing. Oh, without the wreaths, the look is incomplete. Complete christmas. Got it. I'll push it back. I know it sounds crazy, but our marketing team discovered that houses that are staged for christmas from October to the end of the year have a 60% higher sell rate. Oh, that high? Yeah, people wanna picture what their home is gonna look like at christmas. We're not just staging a house. We're staging the idea of how that house makes them feel. But won't they be kinda disappointed when they got here, and the house is actually empty? Never really thought about it. They can decorate it themselves. You know, I didn't realize that staging an open house required this much knowledge of christmas decorating. Don't worry. The more you do it, the better you get at it. I bet you go all out for your own christmas. I used to when I was a kid. But now I'm so busy staging houses that my christmas gets put on the back burner. You don't do anything to celebrate? Visit family? My dad's retired, and he travels at the holidays. I do go to our annual christmas party. - Hey, that's something. - Yeah. Mr. Lexington rented out the deller art gallery. Should be fun. [phone chimes] speaking of the boss. Oh. Oh, good. You're looking over the projections for next quarter. Yes, riveting stuff. Oh, wait, here. Try this new blend I've been working on. I like it. I was thinking we could try it out at the larimer store. That's actually what I wanted to talk to you about. Oh, good. More charts and graphs. As you know, we're on track to open up three more king coffee roasters in colorado, with the goal to expand out of state. Oh, I know. That's why I've been working 14-hour days nonstop for this past year. Well, in order to stay on track, we're gonna have to be a little more selective with our bean supplier. As in something cheaper? If we want this franchise to grow, it's the only choice. Yeah, of course. The whole reason I started this company was to serve good quality coffee at a reasonable price. I know, and you have, and we can continue to. We just have to make some changes for the greater good. This is why you hired me, big brother. Oh, and apparently, also to implement christmas decorations in all our stores. Yes, special project initiative. And so far, people are responding well to it. All right, I'll have a look at our supplier options. How's unpacking going? Hmm, it's going. I mean, of course, there's still boxes everywhere and hardly any furniture. You know, I thought this new house would help maddie, but so far, it's not working. Well, I didn't just move back here for this job. If you or maddie ever need anything, I'm here. Thanks. King roasters in every state. That's the goal. Yup, that's the goal. No, no, no, no, no, no, we sent you the correct dates. My assistant cc'd you. I'm looking at the email right now. Well, never in all my years have I witnessed this poorly handled of a situation. Oh, don't think I won't. Everything okay? The deller art gallery double-booked us, so we no longer have a venue for our company christmas party. That's terrible. Is that what you wanted to talk to me about? Oh, no, no, no. I wanted to talk to you about something much more upbeat. I am happy to announce that we are opening up a branch of lexington staging in new york city. That's incredible. You've wanted that for so long. Indeed. Ever since I started the company. Now all that's left is... Finding the perfect person to put in charge. Lori, you do amazing work. I mean, you're ambitious, you're dedicated. I think you would do wonders staging penthouses and luxury hotels. And that is why you are one of three senior-level stagers that I am considering promoting to director of our new york city branch. One of three? Yup. You know, I'm still reviewing portfolios and crunching numbers, but I wanted you to know you're in the running. Thank you so much. Mr. Lexington, I would love to help you find someplace for our christmas party. I have a few venues in mind. You know what I loved about the deller gallery? It reminded me so much of my family's magical storybook home. You know, it just had that elegant but homey feel that's always so welcoming. I think we can find someplace with the same feeling. This close to christmas? Of course. Well, that would be an incredible help. Listen, I will email you a list of all the things that we need, but if you can pull this off, ooh! Thank you. This is really good, thanks. Then just find a local wreath maker. There's gotta be someone nearby. Okay. I am so sorry. I did not see you there. It's fine. I wasn't looking where I was going. - Here, please take this. - Thanks. Waiter, may I get some club soda, please? You carry a handkerchief with you where you go? Well, yeah, you never know when you're gonna dump your takeout all over someone, right? Right. - Thank you. - Thanks. Sorry about your soup. No, don't be. Soup's replaceable. I'm sorry about your shirt. Replaceable too. Oh, smells good. Oh, yeah, it's minestrone, my daughter's favorite. I highly recommend it. I'll keep that in mind. Oh, see? All good. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, of course. Well, enjoy your dinner. You too. - Hey. - Hey. So what was that all about? Minor spill. He was cute. Oh, no. Is that why you brought me here, to pry into my nonexistent love life? Can't a friend just, like, catch up with a friend who works way too much and needs to take more breaks, which maybe include a date here or there? I knew it. - I'm just happy to see you. - Me too. - How are dan and the kids? - Great. And by great, I mean drive me crazy, but in a wonderful way. It must be nice to have a family to come home to. It could be you one day, but it would start with a date. Which would start with free time. Not all of us are superwoman with a great family and great career. Yeah, I'm pretty amazing. You are. Oh, but what about that accountant? I think his name was ted? Oh, well, after canceling on him a couple of times, we finally went out, and all he talked about was bond yields. Those are important. The truth is, with everything going on and this potential promotion and stagings, it would take someone really special to sweep me away. Then cheers to someone really special, wherever he may be. It's your favorite, maddie. Listen, I know we've been eating takeout night after night lately, but I've just been really busy at work. I'm sorry. Hey, how about this? After dinner, we play some good music and tackle those boxes. What about my parent-teacher conference? Right, of course. That is tonight. You forgot, didn't you? Nope. I just didn't remember in a timely manner. It's at 8:00. Ah, it's only 7:30. I'll just call aunt nikky. [line ringing] hey, everett, what's going on? Hey, nikky. How do you feel about coming over to watch your favorite niece tonight for about an hour? Oh, is it her parent-teacher conference tonight? Yes, parent-teacher conferences. You forgot, didn't you? No, I did not forget. Of course. I'd love to spend time with maddie tonight. - I'll be right there. - Okay, great. Thank you so much. See you soon. See? Aunt nikky's on her way over. Everett: So how's maddie doing? Maddie's a wonderful student who goes out of her way to be kind to everyone. I'm happy to hear that. But I am worried about her. She's having a hard time participating in class activities. Yeah, I can see her being shy from time to time. Maybe, but I think it's a bit more than that. I recently assigned the class an essay on what the holidays meant to them, and maddie didn't seem interested. Well, what children are actually interested in writing essays? True. She said it was because the holidays haven't been the same since her mom died, and she wouldn't know what to write. Ah. May I ask how long it's been? About three years. I'm so sorry for your loss. Yeah, I guess I have kinda dropped the ball about christmas these past few years. It's hard to celebrate. I understand. And I know maddie's had a tough time lately. We moved into a new home and really haven't had a chance to make it ours. Well, perhaps that's where you start. Check in with maddie, see what she thinks might make the place feel more like home. I will, and I'll definitely try to make this a better christmas. Maddie's a wonderful little girl. The two of you are lucky to have each other. We are. Everett: Your teacher said so many nice things about you. Maddie: That's good. So did you have fun with aunt nikky? Yeah. I'm glad she lives close by again. Yeah, me too. I'm sorry things have been hard lately. I really am. I just want us to have a great christmas, that's all. Is there anything you really want for christmas? A puppy? Okay. Going big, huh? Anything that might not need potty training? I wish our house looked like it did when we first bought it. It looked so cool. There's christmas stuff everywhere. Oh, no, sweetie. Those houses are just staged like that for when they wanna sell them. They don't actually come with all that christmas decoration. Just helps them sell the home. I'll tell you what. I will do my best to get us some amazing christmas decorations, okay? - Okay. - I love you. - Love you too. - Good night. Lori: You don't have anything available? How about the atrium? You host parties there, right? Thanks. - Any luck? - No. Any place nice enough to host a party is already booked. Why did I tell him I could do this? There's a man on line three. He's trying to track down the designer who staged the house he just bought. - Why? - I don't know. Can you take a message? I've got so many places to go check out. Hello? Yeah, she's not available. Can I take a message? Mm-hmm. The country house on cedar place? Yeah, okay. I'll let her know. Thanks. What did he want? So he wants to hire the exact person who staged his house to come and recreate it. That's a first. The house on cedar place had these gorgeous high ceilings, hardwood floors, elegant, homey feel. Can I get his info? Yeah, of course. Thanks. See you later. See ya. Perfect. [camera clicks] [ding dong] hi there. Hi. I like your boots. Thanks. I don't tell many people this, but I got them on the sales rack. [chuckles] nice. Is everett king home? Dad! He's in his office. Dad! Coming. Sorry about that. Oh! You're the soup guy. One of my many titles. How's the shirt? - It's just fine. - Oh, good. So you're not here to collect the dry cleaning bill then. No. I'm lori townsend from the staging company. From lexington staging? - Yeah. - Dad? Maddie, this is the woman I spilled our soup on the other night. Hi, I'm maddie. It's nice to meet you, maddie. Sorry my dad is a klutz. [chuckles] it actually inspired me to order the minestrone. Well, please, come on inside. Lori: Wow. Everett: Yeah, it looks a little bare, we know. Just a tad. So when maddie and I went to look at the open house you staged, she actually thought it came with all that stuff. It looked like the perfect christmas. Yeah, well, starting in October, we stage for all things christmas. Can you bring it all back? Or more formally, can we hire you to stage the house like you did before, christmas-ready and all? Unfortunately, after we stage a house, we send all the decorations and furniture back. It would be impossible to recreate it. Oh. Or maybe you can do a new staging along the same lines? That's not something I do. Actually, when I heard you called, I came here to ask you for something. Oh, so you didn't come here to stage the house? Since your house has such a spacious homey feel, I was thinking that it would be the perfect place to host our office christmas party. Oh, that's, uh, an interesting request. My boss has a very specific atmosphere in mind. - Hey, this is a win-win. - What do you mean? You stage our house for christmas, work whatever magic you worked before, and we'll let you use the house for your company party. It'll benefit both of us. Okay. - You have yourself a deal. - Great! I'll make this place look better than you could ever imagine. Deal. Will you be able to find a big tree, the same as the one that was here? Yep, just need to order it. No problem. - Oh, is this your wife? - Yeah. My mom died three years ago. I'm sorry to hear that. She was really good at christmas. Yeah, she sure was. Then let's honor her and make this as christmassy as possible. Lori, would you like a cup of coffee? I'd love one. I remember using currier and ives as inspiration when I was staging the house. Currer and what? Currier and ives. It was this old printmaking company that was inspired by christmas imagery that was classic, like horses pulling sleighs and snow-covered houses, holly on the fireplace. Could we get horses pulling sleighs? I don't know about that, but we could probably get decorations that depict it. Thank you. Ah, king roasters coffee. My favorite. That's dad's company. No way. Really? Everett king, founder and ceo. I go there every morning, the one at larimer square. - You do? - Yes, best lattes in town. That's our very first store. I've spent a lot of time there. I kinda miss that place. I'm stuck in an office doing nothing but making boring business decisions. Welcome to the corporate world. Oh, you know, I have a staging across town, but I'll start gathering stuff tomorrow and head to the christmas warehouse. What's that? It's this big store that has lots of christmas decorations that you can buy and rent. - Can I come? - Sweetie, you have school. After? If it's okay with your dad. I've never actually brought anyone there before. I have a meeting. That I can reschedule. Yay! I guess I'll see you guys tomorrow. Everett: Sounds good. Maddie: Bye. Everett: Bye. - I like her. - Yeah, me too. Our house is gonna look awesome! [laughs] this is so cool. I wish we could live here. Well, thank you for letting us tag along. Hopefully, we're not too much of a burden. No, it's really fun to see through new eyes. I'm always coming in such a rush and stressed out that I forgot this place is pretty cool. Maddie: Dad, lori! We have to get this. That would look great in your front foyer. Oh, and, dad, look. A dog bed. You guys have a dog? No, but maddie really wants one. Oh, I see. Hey, maddie, why don't you take these stickers and put them on anything you see that you'd love for your house. I'm on it. Oh, boy. She's really gonna let the power go to her head now. ♪♪ [upbeat] ♪ hey, hey, santa ♪ ♪ it's time to soar across the sky ♪ ♪ all right ♪ ♪ there's a chill in the air ♪ ♪ good cheer everywhere ♪ ♪ it's all right ♪ ♪ mmm, yeah ♪ ♪ people get ready ♪ ♪ christmas is about to take flight ♪ ♪♪ ♪ ho ho ho ♪ ♪ let it snow ♪ ♪ people get ready ♪ ♪ christmas is about to take flight ♪ lori: We wanna pick out pieces that will go with the architecture of your house, but give it a modern feel. That way, the decorations will really pop. Yeah, that's exactly what I was thinking. Have you always been a christmas expert? I guess so. Christmas has always been my favorite holiday. My mom would go all out and decorate our house. Got pretty competitive on our block. I guess that's why I picked a career where I decorate for christmas four months out of the year. Everett: I can only imagine what your own place must look like. Actually, it's lacking in the christmas decor. I guess it's one of those things where when you do it as a career, you don't really do it for yourself. I haven't had a real christmas in years. How about you? Are you a big christmas fan? I was, but it's been hard to get in the spirit, ever since my wife passed. I can only imagine. I wanna be good at doing christmas, you know, for maddie. I want it to mean something again. That's really sweet. Guys... I'm out of stickers! [laughing] that's the nutcracker I picked out. It is! I looked at everything you picked out. So much is gonna go right with the classic christmas theme. You've even picked out stuff I would have never thought of. Thanks. It's looking amazing. There is something else. I didn't see it at the store, but I think we need it. - What is it? - A piano. - Do you play? - My dad does. Or he did. He used to play all the time, especially around christmas. But he stopped when my mom died. He didn't take it with us when we moved. You know what? I'll keep my eyes open for one. Hey, ladies. - Hey. - Wow! It's looking great in here. Oh, look at that. We have a dining room table now. We can eat on it tonight when aunt nikky and casey come over. Yeah, we sure can. And lori can come. Oh, maddie, I'm sure lori has lots of other stuff to do. Do you? My night is unusually free. Then you've gotta stay for dinner. Yeah, you gotta. I'd love to. It's all coming along nicely. I just hung up some more lights. It smells delicious in here. Just an old family recipe that my grandma used to make every christmas. I'm not making any promises though. It's been awhile since I've made this. Well, the smell is on point. Anything I can do? No, please, just sit back and relax. I'm not very good at that. How about chopping? Yeah, sure, if you feel so inclined. Oh, I do. So you like to cook? I don't really have much time, but I can chop. How about you? Oh, no. Believe it or not, this is the first time I'm getting to use the oven. I've just been so busy lately. Well, king roasters coffee must be going well. Yeah. I just hired my sister nikky. You'll get to meet her tonight. Now she keeps me focused on the big picture stuff. Very business oriented. Sometimes I wish I could just make a customer a really good cup of coffee. I feel like I've lost track of why I created king roasters coffee in the first place. But I'm rambling on. I apologize. I totally understand. When I started staging, it was all about the love of it and the passion to make something feel like home. Higher I got up the ladder, the more it felt like a job. Yeah, if we could just forget about all that stuff and concentrate on what's important, right? Bringing joy to someone's day. Exactly. Hey, you know there's an easier way to chop those. Automatic slicer? No. It's all in the wrist. Like this? Yeah, sort of. Wait, you got it. Thank you. Nikky: He did it all in an elf costume, and he ended up winning first prize anyway. [laughing] well, maddie's finally in bed. Nikky was just telling great stories about you, everett. Don't listen to anything she says. I am totally serious. Growing up, everett insisted that the lyrics, "deck the halls with boughs of holly," were actually "deck the halls with buddy holly." and it turned into him wearing horn-rimmed glasses when our school choir sang it. You love that story. Speaking of embarrassing stories, nikky thought she was named after saint nicholas, aka santa claus. Uh, she still thinks that. Ask mom. It's true. Okay, but in all seriousness, everett, this dinner was delicious. I had no idea you could cook. Well, thank you. I felt inspired. Plus, we've had way too much takeout lately. And we have a special guest. Lori, I'm glad my brother found you. The house is looking better than I've ever seen it. Thanks. It's just the beginning. I've got lots up my sleeve. - Kinda cute there. - [laughing] this is the most I've seen you smile in a long time. Well, it was a fun night. Yeah, lori's pretty great. Yeah, she is. It's not like that. She's here to stage the house and use the venue for her company party. It's all professional. Ah, yes, the classic "here to stage the house and use the venue for her company party" routine. That doesn't explain why she was here for hours, listening to me tell embarrassing stories about you. Whatever you're implying, I'm not ready for it. I know it's hard, but at some point, you have to open your heart to someone new again. You're using way too much soap. Okay, mom. ♪♪ ♪ oh, the countdown's on ♪ ♪ just a few more days till christmas comes ♪ ♪ gotta decorate, got shopping left to do ♪ ♪ yeah, the countdown's on, so move along ♪ ♪ gotta get things right for christmas morn ♪ ♪ here it comes ♪ ♪ here comes santa claus ♪ tonya: So he owns all of the stores? Founder and ceo. Impressive. And he hired you to decorate his house? He hired me to restage his house. So decorating. We've talked about this a thousand times. Decorating's a big part of my job. Well, I think it's great that you could actually stage it with the people in mind, instead of just some generic display. Never really thought about it that way. Yeah, the better I stage the house, the better the party will be. Hmm, so you think if lexington comes to the party and sees what a great job you did staging it, he'll forget the other people and give you the promotion? That's the idea. And maddie's bringing so much fun to it, things that I wouldn't think of. Maddie? Everett's daughter. She's adorable. She's 10 years old and clearly an old soul. And lexington doesn't mind his company christmas party is leaning more toward fun than classy? Maddie's bringing the fun, and I think we really balance each other out. What? Nothing. I've just never seen you like this. Like what? Just lighter. That makes no sense. It does to me. I'm going to the office. Now that sounds more like the lori I know. I love you. You wanted to see me? Yes, come on in. I wanna know how the party's coming along. So far, so good. It was a little like starting from scratch, but I think it worked to our advantage. Did you see the new invites? I did, and I saw you chose a private residence. Yeah, it's this beautiful chateau-style home that has the same elegance that the deller art gallery had. I think you're gonna really love it. All right. Well, you know I saw the invites were a lot more celebratory and fun than in years past. Yeah, there's a lot of joy in the staging, while still keeping the classic christmas feel. All right, this gives me hope. You know, another reason why I chose the deller gallery was because of their enormous christmas tree. You know, you just walk in that place, and you get hit with this authentic rocky mountain pine aroma. You think we could do something similar? A real christmas tree. Of course. All right. I look forward to seeing how this all turns out. Me too. I mean, I can't wait to show you. You know, knowing I can count on you for this christmas party, that means a lot, lori. Hey, everything okay? I ordered a fake tree. Is that bad? Apparently, lexington wants an authentic, large, fresh rocky mountain pine. - Oh. - What am I gonna do? Yeah. Maddie: I've never cut down my own tree before. And just to be clear, at no point will we be doing that today. Isn't that why we're going to the mountains? No, we're going to this farm because it has the best trees. And my party and your house deserves the best. So we're not cutting it down with an axe? I'm sorry, honey, but no. But you do gotta help me pick the perfect tree. Yes. So, lori, why go to all the trouble for your company christmas party? I guess I have it in my head that if I impress my boss, he'll pick me for this promotion that I'm up for in new york. You're moving to new york? It depends. I thought if I swayed him with this amazing party that he would choose me. Well, I hope you get it. Thank you. Yeah, you deserve it. You're good at what you do, and you always go above and beyond. I appreciate that. All those so-called christmas tree farms in the big city, they're puny trees because they chop them down too soon. It's a tragedy. Our farm is all about letting the trees grow as tall as they can. Well, I mean, we are a bit restrictive on what will actually fit on the roof of my car. Nonsense. We'll deliver it to you. - Really? - Yes. We know it's a trek up the mountain. We'll make it worth your while. Do you have any tips on picking out the best one? Smell. Use your nose. Do you have a good nose? Not as good as a dog's, but it'll do. [laughing] okay, now go. Go and find one. You know, this is the first time I've picked out a tree since I was maddie's age. Really? I would've thought with all the christmas decorating, that would be impossible. I usually just order fake ones. I haven't had a real tree in years. Well, I'm glad I get to witness this monumental event. [chuckling] okay, so this is gonna sound corny, but I think this is how christmas is supposed to feel. What do you mean? This. Being out in the winter air, taking a tree you can smell. I didn't realize how much I missed it. I love christmas, but I haven't had one in years. Lori, that's not corny at all. I feel it too. Maddie: Found it! Ben: You picked a good one. Yeah, it's a beautiful tree, but will it actually fit inside the house? Yes, I think so. All right then. I guess that's our tree. We'll get it cut and delivered to you pronto. Great. Dad, I'm hungry. Well, tree hunting will do that to you. Can I recommend sally's, a mile or so down the road? Best hot chocolate and pie in the state of colorado. I love pie. Hey, that sounds great to me. What do you say, ladies? Okay, I'm definitely ordering these for the christmas party. This may be the best thing I've ever tried in my entire life. That is quite the statement. Try the cherry. Okay, now that may be the best thing that ever existed. Oh, really? Well, then shall I confuse you by offering you some pumpkin? Yes, yes, you should. Lori, will you spend christmas with us? Maddie, that's so sweet. Maddie, that's a really big thing to ask somebody. You know what? I'll check my schedule and let you know. Okay. Hey, everett, maddie mentioned you play the piano. Oh, did she now? Lori: Yes, she did. I used to dabble in it. Do you take requests? [laughs] I highly doubt all these people trying to enjoy their pie want that kind of disruption. I bet they'd like it, dad. All right, in the name of christmas pie. Any requests, lori? Maddie, you choose. Jingle bells. Jingle bells it is, ladies.

Seems like things are going well. Yeah, the party's coming together great, and the house is looking like they wanted it to. Well, they're lucky to have a decorating master like you. Lately, I feel like the lucky one. [whistling "jingle bells"] - you're whistling. - I am. - You never whistle. - I whistle. Where were you yesterday? I couldn't reach you. I was up in the mountains, helping maddie and lori pick out a christmas tree. With lori? You don't say. It was an errand for the house. Why can't you just admit that you like her? - Because it's not like that. - Really? You went christmas tree shopping with her, you had her over for dinner, she's decorating your house. - It's business for her. - Okay, I'm your sister. I have a sixth sense about this kinda stuff. Just admit it. Okay, what if I do? And what if she feels the same way? But what if it doesn't work out? And what if maddie has to go through another loss? That's a lot of what-ifs. Well, she's up for a job promotion. If she gets it, she has to move to new york. So you do like her. I'm glad that's what you got from all this. Look, I can't even begin to imagine what you and maddie have gone through, and it sucks. Living in fear of something good ever happening again, that's no way to exist. Is that the example you wanna set for maddie? No, of course not. But this is just way too complicated right now. Besides, I don't even know how she feels. This could be just completely one-sided. Yeah, and you'll never know unless you take a chance. I have work to do. Mr. King, haven't seen you here in a while. Yeah, I just thought I'd do a routine check and see if everything is all right. People are loving the christmas decorations. Oh, good. Are you waiting for someone? Uh, no. As a matter of fact, I should head back to the office. [door chime rings] everett king of king roasters coffee? You'd better keep that down. I don't want the paparazzi to swarm. What are you doing here? Well, I used to come in here more and check things out. I'm trying to implement that again. Are you here for your daily latte? That I am. All right, well, I will personally make that for you. I feel so honored. Hey, I was gonna call you. I have some decorations coming to your place this afternoon. - Will you be there? - I have a meeting, and then I have to pick up maddie from her friend's. Oh, okay. But you know what? I have a good idea. Why don't you just go ahead and let yourself in? Really? Are you sure? Decorations take precedence. This is delicious. Well, I'm glad you like it. It's on the house. I better get going. Yeah, me too. - Bye. - Bye. [door chime rings] oh, good, you guys got here just in time to help me decorate the tree. Is everything okay? I'm so sorry. I thought you gave me the keys so that I could decorate while you're at work. I did not mean to upset maddie. No, it's not that. It's not you at all. A student's mom is having an event tomorrow at school. It's a mom-and-me cinnamon ornament-making thing. I told her I'd go, but she said it's a mom thing. Don't they realize some kids don't have a mom? Yeah, and I even talked to the teacher, and she said it's open to anybody, but I think maddie took the mom part literally. Poor thing. Are you okay with us decorating the tree another night? Of course. Actually, do you think it's okay if I went up and spoke to her? Yeah, go for it. I'm just gonna go make gingerbread cookies because when in doubt, I use sugar to make my kid feel better. Well, I'd like to try one of those. You got it. ♪♪ ♪♪ [continues] maddie, can I come in? Yeah. ♪♪ [continues] that's a gorgeous music box. My mom gave it to me when I was five. May I? ♪♪ it's very special. You must miss her a lot. All the time. Can I tell you something? I lost my mom when I was really young too. Really? I wasn't much older than you. I missed her all the time. But then you know what I did? I found happiness in spending time with friends. I went to the movies, eating good cookies. And it was in those moments that I felt most connected to her. Above all else, honey, moms want their kids to be happy. I like that. Now, this ornament thing, what's it all about? Brianna's mom is really good at crafts, and she's coming in and teaching everybody how to make cinnamon stick ornaments. People are bringing their moms. Brianna's mom is crafty, huh? Well, has she ever made a chandelier out of old spoons? - Have you done that? - Yes. In college as an art project. How would you feel if I came and made ornaments with you tomorrow? Really? You wanna come? I would love to. Okay, yeah, awesome! Awesome. Hey, how is she? Better. I hope it's okay. I offered to make cinnamon stick ornaments with her tomorrow at school. You did? Wow, thanks. Wait, have you ever made cinnamon ornaments? No, never made them, but I'm excited to try. You're really good with her, by the way. Thanks. I lost my mom when I was really young, so I know how hard it can be. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know that. It's okay. Maddie is a really strong kid. Yes, she is. And I honestly don't know what I'd do without her. She's my rock. I've never really spent much time with kids. My best friend tonya has three, but we usually hang out when she needs a little break. Well, you're a natural. You'll make a great mom someday, if that's what you want, of course. I always thought I'd have a really big family. Then I got so focused on my career that that just didn't really happen. Well, what about now? Now there's this promotion, and it means more work. Well, take it from a guy who used to take everything for granted. Success means nothing without somebody to share it with. That's something I have to remind myself from time to time. - [beeping] - cookies. [school bell ringing] remember, if you get stuck on what to make, tie a bunch of sticks together, add a bell or two, and then you have the perfect ornament. Girl: Teacher, teacher! What are you making? I'm tying these ribbons around this cinnamon stick and making a christmas tree. I'm gonna make one of those next. What are you working on? Is it a reindeer? No, it's a dog. I should have known. But I made it for you. Oh, I love it, maddie. Oh, I don't believe we've met. I am mrs. Pryor, maddie's teacher. - I'm lori. - Are you everett's girlfriend? No. I'm helping maddie decorate her house. Oh. But she's also my friend. Yes, that too. Well, that's wonderful. Thank you for joining us. Thanks for having me. Well, I'll leave you two to it. Wow, what's that? Want me to teach you how to make one of these? Aww. The entire room smells like cinnamon, huh? Cinnamon or christmas? A very cinnamony christmas. I got this for the top of the tree. Oh, wow, it's great. I ordered it online. I used to have one just like it when I was a kid. I thought maddie would love it. Will you do the honors? I'd love to. What do you think? It looks amazing. Maddie's gonna be so excited when she gets home from her friend's. That was very thoughtful of you. No christmas is complete without a tree topper. If someone had told me a few weeks ago that I'd be decorating christmas ornaments with a 10-year-old in a classroom instead of running around the office, I wouldn't have believed them. And if someone had told me that the woman who staged the house would be helping make this the most special christmas in years, I wouldn't have believed them either. How do you feel about it now? I think I'm happy you came into our lives. What are you doing tomorrow? I have a staging in the morning and then christmas party prep. Well, how do you feel about taking a break and coming by king roasters in the square? Sure. What for? It's a surprise. A good surprise. Okay. - That sounds like a date. - No, it's not a date. It's a get-together with a surprise. You together, alone, at his coffee shop, after hours. Right, not a date. Do you want me to help you carry those? Yes. Christmas shopping for three kids, not easy. By the way, if you want me to teach you how to make cinnamon stick ornaments, I can show you. - Okay, martha stewart. - Hardly. So... Are you gonna tell him tomorrow? Tell him what? That you like-like him. Excuse me? Sorry. It comes with being a mom. Lori. Lori, hello. Sorry, what? In the market for a piano? No, just always looking out for pieces for my stagings. Hmm. There's the lori I'm familiar with. Always got work on the brain. Just as I was thinking maybe this family might be shifting your priorities.

Welcome to king roasters' official christmas coffee tasting. Wow, look at this. I've never been to a coffee tasting. Wine tasting, yes, but never a coffee tasting. Well, you know, some folks would argue that there are more notes in coffee than there are in wine. Is that so? Now I know the plain latte is your go-to drink here, but it is christmas, and we both jumped headfirst in the festivities, so I would like to broaden your horizons. I'm all in. Good. Please have a seat. Thanks. Of course. All right, your first drink of the evening. What is it? Eggnog latte. I'm not really an eggnog person. Trust me, you don't have to be. Okay. Oh, that's good. It's the only time I do eggnog. [laughs] okay, a new taste. It smells good. Tastes really good. Peppermint? Mmm. I call it candy cane mocha. I used colombian beans, darker roast, which brings out the natural oils, which complements the melted chocolate. You really know your coffee. Ehh. I can geek out about this stuff from time to time. When did you get so passionate about it? When I was in college, I was a barista, and that's when I realized I'd like to experiment with the different tastes, and to socialize with the people more than I liked going to my economics class. And then I started roasting my own beans, seeing what tasted good, what I liked, what others liked, and then I decided to open up my own coffee shop. People seem to like it. I can see why. Yeah. And the more they liked it, the more people told me that I should open up another location. So I did. Then another. And now there's pressure to keep expanding. From nikky? Yeah, but she's right. I mean, we're doing so well we should use this opportunity to grow. Is that what you want? I think so. Anyway, try this one. Now, that tastes like christmas. I was inspired by the ornaments you made with maddie. Cinnamon vanilla latte. It's also heaven on earth. It is. ♪ "it came upon a midnight clear" ♪ okay, I want you to taste one more. Okay. But please be honest about this one. I will. It's, um... - It's not good, right? - Sorry. No, don't be sorry 'cause I feel the same way. But that's the coffee nikky wants us to switch to. Well, it's not that bad. But I'd rather have some of that candy cane mocha. Mmm. Hey, you want me to show you how to make it? Sure. Have you used one of these before? - Never. - All right, well... You'll be able to do it. It's real simple. Now, you wanna steam the milk. Like this? Yeah, you got it. Just do your best to hold it steady. Am I doing it right? Yeah, you got this. Now, you wanna keep the wand covered. Okay. You got-- ohh! - Sorry, sorry. - No, no, it's okay. Don't worry about it. It's just a rookie mistake, that's all. - [door chime rings] - man: Are you guys open? Sorry, we're closed. Hmm. I should probably clean this up, right? Yeah, I guess so. This is the report you asked for. Thanks. Hey, I just wanted to say thanks again for watching maddie last night. Oh, fair warning. Casey introduced her to monopoly, and the way she took to it, might have another mba in the family. Noted. So how was the date? It wasn't a date. Of course not. Just you two alone together... It was a coffee tasting. Oh, bro, it has been so long since you've been in the dating game. Usually people do dinner or a movie. Stop. We had fun. But more importantly, we both decided that this is terrible. Promise you gave it a fair shot? I promise. No worries. I have a few other samples we can try. We will find one that works. Dad, dad! Close your eyes. Lori got you a surprise. Ooh, well, what is it? You can't see it yet. Just close your eyes. Okay. But, maddie, don't let me trip. Dad, trust me. Just no peeking. Okay, I promise. No peeking. - Can I open my eyes yet? - Not yet. Is this too much buildup? What if he doesn't like it? How can I not like something you got me? - But I am gonna open my eyes. - No! One second. Okay, now. Ta-da! I just thought you played so beautifully, and we found it on sale, and it was within the budget, and it ties everything together so well for the party. ♪♪ I love it. - Yay! - You do? This is just what the house was missing. I'll go get the decorations. Decorations for... - More lights. - Ah. Thank you so much for doing this. It's my pleasure. And not just the piano, but for everything. You brought christmas back into our lives. You brought it back into mine too. Got it! Oh, let's go put them over here. Yeah. Well, what do you think? Great. Hey. - I just think we should-- - hey. Oh, it's good you're here. What's going on? Winter storm megan is headed our way. When? In two days. I hope people still come to the christmas party. Me too. It'd be a shame to have to cancel after all the work you've done. - Cancel? - Yeah. I wouldn't want anybody getting stuck in the snow. Maybe it won't be that bad. Let's hope for a christmas miracle. Lights out, maddie. One more chapter? Ah, that's what you said about a half-hour ago. I just want you to get a good night's sleep. Are you sure I can't go to lori's party? Yeah, but only because it's gonna be a bunch of grown-ups. Trust me, you're gonna have a lot more fun at tracy's house. Do you like-like lori? [sighs] yeah, I think I might. Does that bother you? No. Good. Listen, I know we haven't had a chance to talk about new people coming into our lives, but-- dad, it's cool. I love you. Love you too. All right, five more minutes. Ten? Fine. Good night. Like this? Yeah, but not the entire bottle. I like a more rich taste in my hot chocolate. Oh, I know. [laughs] all right, now take the milk we steamed and pour and stir. This is too easy for you. You're an absolute natural. Can I add a shot of espresso to make it a mocha? As impressed as I am with you knowing that, no, you cannot. How about we use some whipped cream instead? Me too, please. - Cheers. - Cheers. - Mmm. - [giggling] I like your new look. I'm trying to mix it up. [horn honking] oh, I bet that's tracy's mom here to pick you up and take you to school. All right. See you, dad. - Maddie, don't forget a lid. - Bye, dad. All right, so these are all the beans we can use if we wanted to expand our company right now. I want you to taste them. Now, this is our typical medium roast we serve in all our stores. This is so much better. We should wait to expand. [sighs] and risk losing the demand? I mean, word of mouth is everything. This is the time to capitalize on our success. Yeah, but wouldn't it be terrible if word of mouth got around about how bad our coffee tasted? I say we wait a year or two and figure out a more efficient way to cut cost without risking any of our quality. Okay. We'll wait to expand. - Yes? - Yes. But that means growing what we have. We should increase our marketing and social media presence. Yeah, we should do that. I like that idea. Sorry if I was pushing you in a direction you didn't wanna go. No, nikky, it's good. I need somebody like you. But I just want you to remember that for me, it's not about being on top. It's about being the best. That's why I love you, brother. Mm. - Whew. - [laughing] this is delicious. Cinnamon vanilla latte, everett's creation. Smart man. We almost kissed. - What? - The other day. And? We haven't really spoken since. Wh-what does it mean? I don't know, but I can't really think about it because the storm is supposed to hit any second, and I'm worried this is all gonna be for nothing. Well, how can you say that? Clearly, it's not for nothing. There's everett. I know. There's everett and there's maddie, and the past few weeks, they've been the highlight in my life. But? But the whole reason I did this party in the first place was for this promotion, and it's what I really want. Is it? I don't know, but I can't spend my time thinking what this is or isn't. It sounds to me like maybe you should talk to everett. Give him a chance to tell you how he's feeling. I need to deal with this storm first. It's supposed to hit tonight. Okay, there's nothing you can do about that. It's out of your control. But what is in your control is figuring out what's going on with everett. ♪ my baby's home ♪ ♪ so far away ♪ ♪ and now that it's christmastime ♪ ♪ I just wanna say ♪ ♪ won't you come home ♪ ♪ come home for christmas this year ♪ ♪ and spend it with me ♪ ♪ yeah ♪ ♪ I know it ain't easy ♪ ♪ you got so much going on ♪ ♪ but without you this christmas ♪ ♪ it would feel all so wrong ♪ ♪ won't you come home ♪ - the storm. - Didn't hit. - At least not yet. - Great!

Oh, no, so that's the one you should talk to. She knows where everything goes. Lori: The glasses go over here. Hey, looks like it's coming along nicely. Everett, can I speak to you for a second? Yeah, sure. So about the other day... Um... I just wanted to say... The thing is that, I... Thanks for letting us use your home. Yeah, of course. The place looks amazing. - Yeah, it does. - All right. So I'm gonna head to the office, finish up a little bit of work, I'm gonna drop maddie off at a friend's, and I'll see you tonight? Sounds good. Casey and I are really looking forward to tonight. It was so nice of lori to invite us. Yeah, it should be fun. I know that look. Spill it. There's no look. I'm good. We're finally back on the same page, and I'm thrilled. You know people can't read minds. What? The best thing you can do is just tell her how you're feeling. Oh, really? And what if she doesn't feel the same way? Then at least you tried. Look, when you were finally honest with me, we got somewhere. Why don't you try being honest with her? You know, as your older brother, I should be the wise one. ♪♪ [jazz piano] ♪♪ ["o come all ye faithful"] hi. Oh, thank you. Thank you. - Oh, no. - No, thanks. Mm. Good. Well, what do you think? My daughter actually made those. Oh, they're fantastic. Yeah, I told her the event was catered, but she absolutely insisted. Well, I'm glad she did. - Lexington. - Everett king. Ah! So you're the man who owns this home. That's correct. And you must be lori's boss. The one and only. Thanks for letting us use your house. Well, can I just say this entire home is all lori's doing. In fact, the reason we bought the place was because of her original staging. She's a very talented woman. Oh, yes. She did a very good job of bringing together the joy and fun of a classic home-style christmas. Ah, speaking of which... Well, don't you look beautiful. Thank you. Absolutely stunning. And not only you, but this entire party. I'm glad you feel that way. I see you two have met. Oh, yeah. Everett is quite the host. Not only does he own the most amazing coffee shop in town, he's an incredible musician. Oh, is that so? You should play something for us then. Oh, no, I'm not that good. I insist.

And your displays, I mean, they're always topnotch. You have a real eye for what works, and you're always brave enough to take on anything. And that's why it gives me great pleasure to promote you to executive director of our new york offices. [cheering] well, what do you say, lori? Do you accept? It would be an honor. Thanks so much. All right! [laughs] merry christmas, everyone, and here's to you all! [cheering] - congratulations! - Thank you. You know, I'll be so sad to see you go, but I'm so happy for you. I'll show you all the ropes before I leave. Please. Actually, I need to talk to you about that. Go ahead. We booked our first client in new york. The ritz wants us to stage one of their ballrooms for a new year's eve party. I'll need you to head out right away. When is right away? Day after tomorrow. - Christmas? - Yes. Another reason why you are perfect for this job, lori. You're always available to work on christmas. Now, listen, I will take care of all the arrangements. - I just need you to be there. - Of course. Lori, you have earned this, every bit of it. Party seems to be going well. Oh, hey, yeah. I just had to refill the ice. Do you know nikky's gonna be meeting my parents for the first time on christmas? That's a big step. Yeah. Especially since I've never introduced my parents to anyone I've dated. It'll go well. Anyone who knows you and nikky knows you're meant to be. That means a lot. Still, there's always risk, you know, with these big steps. It's scary. Yeah, but it'll be worth it. Yes, yeah, totally worth it. This is about nikky meeting your parents, right? That or anything else that seems terrifying at first, but needs to be done. Did nikky send you in here? No. No, I just wanted to see if you needed a hand with the ice. Oh, thank you, but no. Go enjoy the party. You too. There you are. I needed some fresh air. It's freezing! Here, put this on. Thank you. Yeah, I guess the storm's coming in later than predicted, huh? - Listen-- - have you ever-- sorry, go ahead. No, you go. I am so happy for you for getting this promotion. And I'm sorry if what I'm about to say is terrible timing, but I can't keep dancing around this. But I don't think I can let you leave without telling you... I'm falling in love with you. Ever since you came into my life, I've felt joy again. Just being around you, talking with you, laughing with you, I honestly didn't think I'd ever feel this way again. I-I... I'm so sorry. I can't. I'm leaving for new york. Yeah, of course, as you should. I just needed you to know. You guys have been so amazing. I really owe this promotion to you.

I think I'm stepping down. I just wanna be the owner. I wanna get back to roasting and being hands-on in all the stores. You're better at all this business stuff. You should be handling the day-to-day. I can't believe this. And most importantly, I wanna spend more time with maddie. Everett, I don't know what to say. Well, I mean, I will be making the final decision on the big stuff, but you're better suited for this. I promise I'll make you proud. Merry christmas. Merry christmas. - [ringing] - ho ho ho ho! Merry christmas. Can I get that bag for you? Merry christmas. Maddie: After my mom died, christmas never felt like christmas. It felt sad and made me wish it could just not be christmas anymore. But this year is different. This year, we had lori. She helped fill our house with christmas. She decorated every room, she helped us buy a tree, and she even made ornaments with me. But she also made my dad smil. My dad forgot how to smile for a while, but not anymore. Lori made things fun again. Christmas was good again. So this year, what christmas means to me is hope. Hope that things will always be okay if you have family like my dad and friends like lori. ♪♪ all right, maddie, this is a big gift, but I want you to take your time opening it, okay? Okay.

Sally, come see my room. So you got her the puppy? Yeah. It was inevitable. But what are you doing here? Aren't you supposed to be on your way to new york? I decided I didn't wanna move to new york. Well, what about the promotion? I pitched lexington the idea that instead of just staging houses, we would also stage houses for families at christmas. He loved it, and he wants me to head up the expansion here in denver. So you're staying here? What's the point of success if you don't have someone to share it with? Merry christmas, lori.
