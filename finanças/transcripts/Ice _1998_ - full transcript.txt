(orchestra music) (dramatic music) - One eight seven, one one in. - Come on, I need some air, I need some cold air. - No way. - (Speaks in foreign language). - Wearing black pants (mumbles). - Here Drake, I got you an ice cream. - Ah I don't want any ice cream. Anybody seen him? - Nobody. - Are you sure? - Don't you'd think they'd recognize a guy that looks like this? - Maybe now he's got normal hair. - Maybe now we're wasting our time. Let's go home. - He jumped bail on Long Beach. I'm not giving up so easy. (Sighs) I hate the heat. (suspenseful music) - Solar (mumbles) is down by 20. These readings just aren't possible. There must be a defect in the equipment doctor. (beeping) - The equipment is fine. (hip hop music) (grunting) - Knock it in, knock it in. Huh, punch it. Come on. - Are you finished? - Hi. - Behave yourself. - I'm behaving. Just go to work. Come on. (cheering) - Come on (mumbles). - Yeah. (percussive music) - Coming through. - Watch yourself. - Hey get out of the ring. - Get out of here. (grunting) (bell ringing) (cheering) (horn honking) - Who cares if we had caught him. Some smart attorney we'd have him out tomorrow and we'd have to chase him again. - Go ahead, say who you mean. - I'm not mentioning any names. - But you mean Julie. - Hey, tell me, tell me. Was Julie's right cross as good as the champ's in there huh? - You're funny, you're a funny man. And don't get me going about my ex wife and I'm suppose to meet Allison later. - Hmm. - There's no hmm's Zapata. Every time I mention Allison you go hmm. - Hmm. - No, it's not a hmm thing. It's a going along thing. I'll let you know when it becomes a hmm thing. I can see my breath. What is this? It's May and it's freezing. - First you're too hot, then you're too cold. You're like a little flower. - Look, I don't like the heat. I can't take the cold. I didn't move to LA for the traffic. (dramatic music) - You except me on your isolated assumption to walk into the White House and tell the president we're on the threshold of a new ice age? - Dr. Golding, I don't expect you or Dr. Tyson to do anything. I except you to sit on your hands arguing-- - Dr. Kisler. - Arguing the shades of distinction between the terms cataclysm and apocalypse while the country's destroyed. - Move over global warming fans, here comes Kisler. The only term I'm considering term I'm considering, doctor, is alarmist, okay. - Listen, a quarter of the sun is covered with massive sun spots. It's a major turn in the solar cycle. I'm not an alarmist. Gentleman, I'm a realist. - Ah come on, you never talk about her. - See I just want to know why you want to know. - I just feel like if I knew a little bit more about Julie and how you guys were together, then I can be bored in making your life hell (chuckles). - Uh well, we were young when we got married. She worked as a paralegal. Then she went to law school. And now she's a lawyer. - I don't want her resume. I want to know what she's like. - She use to be a lot like me and now she's not. Hey, you think Max is gonna like this? Wait, check this out. (loud squealing) - Well, I'd know better if I'd met him. - Yeah, you will, see he wants a real dog but Greg has more sunk in his carpets than I'm gonna make in my life, so. - Ah, well you know what, just the fact that you bought for him, he's gonna love it. What's that? - Ah I got tired of losing my keys. - Is there someone in there? - No, I leave the TV on to discourage the solid citizens I arrest all day for making another life error. - You are search a people person. (vibe music) - Hey, it's California, it's cold and it's cold. - So Allison, other than the mess, what do you think? - Well, I don't want to hurt your feelings or anything but now I now why we always go to my place. - Maid quit. - Ah, it's stuck. Don't you ever defrost? - Meanwhile the rest of the country will still (mumbles). They'll be huddled around their space heaters. And that's the weather, whether you like-- - Thank you very much. - Come here, let me see where you got hit. - Let's just forget about ice. Maybe a little heat on it might help. (piano music) (thunder rumbling) (dramatic music) (sirens ringing) (clapping) - We hear she was a real knockout. - Don't look at me, I didn't tell a soul. - Hey Drake, when are you going pro? - Ah maybe I told one or two people. - You know Zapata, nobody likes a funny cop. - Oh I don't know, might be the last laugh we have if this weather keeps up. Forget about calling in sick, all leaves will be canceled. Just look forward to spending all that overtime. (Mumbles) wear your long johns. - Ah my man's impervious to cold, he was a navy seal you know. (phone ringing) - Yeah, I talked to my sister in New York. She said they got a foot of snow there. You know how nuts it gets in LA when it rains, imagine if it snowed. - Drake, our man Calvin's in Venice shacked up with a waitress from the club. - It's 9:02 here in the B Jam throughout the freezing cold Los Angeles (mumbles). Can you believe that it's 33 degrees? - Calvin, weren't you suppose to go to the market yesterday? - You know what we gotta do? We gotta save up some money and move to Florida. I got a friend who started up a limo service in Boca. - Oh honey, Florida is too humid. Besides it's got all those palmetto bugs and uh. - Not in Boca baby. Ah, damn (mumbles). (loud knocking) - LAPD, open up. - Um, wait a minute, I'm not dressed yet. - Police, open up now. (loud knocking) I said open up. (loud grunting) Marathon's over. - You are freaking relentless man, like a sick cartoon. Everywhere I go there you are. - Calvin. Don't hurt him, let me go. - Calm down. - Okay, okay. - I'm innocent, man. (dog barking) - Innocent men don't run. - They do when they're black. It's a tradition we have with the police in this town. (thunder rumbling) (dog barking) (dramatic music) (sighing) - Just tell me how long this will last, Dr. Tyson. - Sir, I believe we're through the worst of it. Our top meteorologist predict that temperatures will return to near normal within 36 hours. - Mr. President, Dr. Norman Kisler is on the video link from Los Angeles. - Sir, we haven't entirely discounted Dr. Kisler's model but the consensus is-- - I know what the consensus is. I want to hear anything. Dr. Kisler. - Mr. President, I'm sure my esteemed colleagues doctors Golding and Tyson have painted a suitably rosy landscape of the future. I'm glad you're finally ready to face the truth. - We've discussed this, doctor. Full scale evacuations are not an option. - The time you've already lost will be counted in human lives. - Just give us the worst case scenario, doctor. - The northern states can expect temperatures of 80 to 100 degree below zero Fahrenheit. (laughing) - Mr. President, I'm willing to stake my professional reputation-- - Moving south, I expect a mean of 10 to 20 below, with wind chills up to a hundred below. - On other occasions he's put-- - The area near the equator will be the warmest. There's still time to evacuate key personnel. - How long will this last, doctor? - My calculations indicate the sun will regenerate in somewhere between 11 and 27 years. I would guess most of the country will not be livable until then. - Mr. President, Dr. Tyson and I don't feel that the data is sufficient to make this kind of irresponsible-- - We cannot discount the worst case scenario, gentlemen. Bring me the civil evacuation plans. I want the guard and military put on alert. Let's move some equipment around where it'll do the most good. Pour me one of those, thank you. Dr. Kisler, what can we do to head this thing off? - Nothing. Nothing. (dramatic music) - My fellow Americans, we are currently faced with a serious crisis in many parts of our country. Unusual solar activity has caused a record drop in temperature here at home and around the world. This morning, I signed an executive order declaring a national state of emergency. But let me stress, I have been assured by the best scientific minds of our nation that the worst is behind us. (doorbell ringing) - I'll get it. - Still, while this crisis is in effect, your federal government-- - Uh huh uh. (laughing) - Hey dad, isn't this great? They closed the schools. - Yeah, well it's cold out there. - I built a snowman. - Yeah, how big? - It was huge. - I heard it was somebody's birthday today. (laughing) - Use this time spend with our families. - Whose birthday? - I'm sure we'll get through this. And we'll be stronger for it. - And happy birthday. - Awe, thanks dad. - What do you think, Jim, is he underplaying the severity of the situation here? - Well, some people will have that to say. On the other hand-- - Drake. - Hey. (bell ringing) - Whoa, this is great mom, it's the best. - Yeah, well it's not a real dog but. (toy dog barking) - Hey dad, we have some cake left over from last night. Do you want a piece? - Yeah. (toy dog barking) - Drake, you're working on his birthday? - Well, I don't really have a choice. - Here's the birthday cake. - Cake? Looks like pie. - It's a tart. - Hey Greg, look what my dog can do. (toy dog barking) - That's great, that's great. (toy dog barking) - Listen, I just came by 'cause I wanted to make sure you guys were okay. - Yeah, we're fine. (toy dog barking) - Max, Max, please. We're fine here. I'm sure we have everything we could possible need. - Well I'm tactical alert. I've got to pick up Zapata, his car's stuck. They want us down at the airport. - Here, I'll take it. - Thank you. - So, you know how to get ahold of me. - Bye dad, thanks for the dog. - Yeah, happy birthday. (toy dog barking) (suspenseful music) - All flights are canceled. There are no additional arrivals or departures scheduled. Please contact your airline representative for details. - Excuse me, miss, miss you're not listening to me. Miss. - I'm sorry. - You don't seem to understand what I'm saying. - All flights are canceled. There are no additional arrivals or... (dramatic music) - You guys flew down from Collins? How's it going up there? - Unbelievable, they closed the base. - They really think we're gonna need one of these down here? - They just hand me an order. - What's with all these crates? - 50,000 body bags, sign here. - All airport units. Terminal three, departure level, man with a gun. Terminal three, departure level, man with a gun. - LAPD, move, move out of the way. (people gibbering) - Help! - Move, move. - Hey, hey. - All flights are canceled-- - Go right. - Please contact the airline-- - Get back. (loud clicking) Out of my way, out of my way. - I have a ticket and I'm getting on the plane. - Alright pal, everyone wants to get out of town. That's the way to do it. - No. (gunshot firing) (woman screaming) - Give me the gun. (loud grunting) - We've got to get of here, we're all gonna die, unless we get out. - You'll be okay. - Oh god. - Just relax, alright, give me your other hand. - I just want to see my family. I just want to see my family. - Airlines representatives. - The airport's closed, go home. - We can't go home. - How? - There's nothing for you here. - But we're all gonna die. (dramatic music) - Your model seems to be gaining credence, Dr. Kisler. - Where's your insipid counterpart? - Dr. Tyson resigned his post today as chairman of the special committee. As interim chairman, I would like to thank you. - You could thank me by getting me out of here. I shouldn't be left here to freeze. - The chief of staff signed off on your pick up. - Just remember, I'm the only one who truly understands this crisis, you need me. - I'm sending you encrypted instructions with the time and coordinates. - You're flying out on Air Force One and you're sending me encrypted email? - I warn you, there's only room for you. Key personnel, no one else. - Of course. - Good luck, Dr. Kisler. - Good luck to you, Dr. Golding. - Look, I don't want a lawyer. What I want is for you to go south right now, today. Yeah, I know what they're saying on TV, I heard it in here on the radio. They're lying to you baby, they're lying. - How do you know that? - Look, I just got a feeling, okay, trust me. - Calvin, I'm not gonna leave you there. - No, there's nothing you can do for me now, go. Don't wait for me, please. - I'll see you there tomorrow. - No, I won't see you here tomorrow. Listen, baby, listen. Listen. (dramatic music) - This is Shawn Jameson reporting from a temporary shelter in St. Louis, Missouri-- - I'm gonna check on Max. - Where the temperature has dropped-- - Forget trying to use your phone, 'cause I tried to call my parents up in Seattle and I just got some weird busy signal and then it just completely went dead. And I was watching on the news and they said it was really bad up there. - Death toll could reach 200,000 in the most severe weather conditions this country has ever seen. Shawn Jameson, St. Louis, Missouri. - I wouldn't worry about that. They're use to this kind of weather up there. - In his final report before he and many others were buried when a building collapsed under the weight of snow, our prayers go out to his family. The streets were deserted in Paris today. But in Rome, a hundred thousand of the faithful braved the snow to hear a special mass given by the Pope in which he prayed for guidance and a speedy end to the disaster. While in Great Britain, legend has it when the ravens leave the tower of London, England will fall. The ravens have departed. Back after. (dramatic music) - Well, ravens one, Pope nothing. (suspenseful music) (ambient music) - Authorities are alerting everybody to stay at home, and frankly, there doesn't seem to be much point to going anywhere today. Virtually all schools in the area within the Orange County all the way to Malibu have been closed. Most government offices are only handling emergencies. (squeaking) (heavy breathing) It's the first in (mumbles), ironically-- - Pipes are frozen. - Better. Hey, what do you think? - You don't get to wear these. - Hey, why, no fair. - Uh, I hated the military, I hated the North Atlantic, and I hated the freezing cold. They remind me I can make it through anything. - Yeah, but they're so cool. I want them. - Yeah, well sign up and get your own. (chuckling) - Oh, gotta get to work - Hey, guy, gah, shh. Uh, another cold day in hell. - No, that was yesterday. Today hell freezes over. - There's some obviously desperate people are still trying to get somewhere. (wind blowing) Drifts are covering parked cars now. (violin music) (loud swooshing) (engine starting) (cracking) (wind blowing) (dramatic music) (baby crying) - Get her stuck with an IV and get her up to three with the others. - Got it. (baby crying) (horns honking) (dramatic music) - Damn, it's cold. - What's the deal, what's the word from headquarters? - There is no more headquarters. - What are you talking about, who's in charge? Where we suppose to be? - I don't know. Smith heard it from Myers, there's a regional command in San Diego. - San Diego? - We're to help out where we can. They're setting up an emergency relief station at either the civic center or the convention center. - Well, which one is it? - I don't know. - Well, it's a pretty big distinction when it takes an hour to go three miles Zapata. - Look, he don't know alright. That's all the information they got. - I'm sorry, I would just like to know who's in charge. - We're in charge man, you and me. You're in charge of that side of the car. I'm in charge of this side of the car. And we're both in charge of the heater. (sighing) - Well, I'm in charge of the heater. (wind blowing) (dramatic music) - Sir, it's 60 below and dropping. If we don't leave now, it'll be too late. - They survived Valley Forge with just a few blankets and rags wrapped around their feet. - Air Force One is standing by to fly us down to Guam. We're not sure how long we can keep the runway clear. We're not helping anybody by staying here to do die, sir. - Yeah, time to go. (dramatic music) (sirens ringing) - Hey, mister man, you planning on letting us all freeze down here like some kind of popsicles or something? How about some heat huh? Just a little heat, just 'cause we're friends. I tell you what, you can keep the heat. Just send us down some light, alright. Somebody, somebody. (siren ringing) - Let's get it. - Come on. - Drake, forget it. - What are you gonna do, just stand here and let this go on? - What are you gonna do, arrest everybody? - Let me out, come on. - (Mumbles). - Hey, buddy. (loud punching) (man grunting) Go steal your own groceries. Here. (dramatic music) I gotta go checkout Max. I told Allison I'd pick her up. - Let's get her on the way. (door closing) - You should all go home. We're closing down after the night shift. - What? - Someone upstairs received word the military's gonna evacuate the critical. - Uh, we can't close. - There's gonna be emergency medical centers opening soon. - Well what's gonna happen tomorrow when people try to get here and the door's locked? - There hasn't been an ambulance or a walk in for two hours. People can't get here. (ambient music) - Uh, Drake. What are we gonna do? - South is the way I tell you. Land of my ancestors. Find me a nice fat senorita to keep me warm. Knock back some (speaks in foreign language) so I can feel my toes again (sighs). - You really think heap of yours is gonna make it? - Made in the U.S. of A. I think I'll stop by the mechanics before I go. - Trouble getting to Max. Allison? - Well, if you don't mind, I'll just come with you. - Hmm. - Look out. (yelling) (dramatic music) (doors closing) What are you doing out here? - Try to get him up. - You alright? - Let's go, let's get him in the backseat. - You got it? - It's okay, we got it. - Okay I've got his briefcase. - I got the door. - Get the door, it's alright, I got him. - Get in. (door closing) (car screeching) - I left my car, I just left it. I started walking, no one came. - Okay sir, just don't move your fingers, alright, don't move them. - You have to take me to that old naval station north of Malibu. - This isn't a taxi buddy. - You don't understand. I have to get to that naval station. I'm Dr. Norman Kisler. - I'm Zapata. This is Drake, that's Allison. Look, just sit tight, relax, and take deep breaths. (heavy breathing) - The ship. - Okay, doctor-- - The ship. - I'm serious, Dr. Kisler, you're really in no condition to anything right now, so just try to relax. - You have to take me there now. - Yo yo yo, okay, okay. - Okay, so let's just calm down. - Okay, okay, alright, alright. - Okay Drake. - So we're going to Malibu. - This road's kind of slippery, alright. - It's a long trek up there, so just put-- - I got it. (loud smacking) (loud grunting) (gunshot firing) (woman screaming) (car screeching) (woman screaming) (loud grunting) (loud crashing) (dramatic music) (wind blowing) (dramatic music) - Come on. Come on. - Drake, I'm sorry. - You, you son of a-- - It wasn't my fault, it wasn't my fault. (loud punching) - Drake. - You don't know who I am. - Drake, stop, you're going to kill him. (loud grunting) Stop. (dramatic music) (heavy breathing) - Come on, we can make it to the storm drain. Leave him. - No, I'm not gonna just leave him here to die. - He was gonna shoot you, he killed Zapata, come on. Get up, get up. (dramatic music) (wind blowing) (heavy breathing) (dramatic music) Come on. (classical music) (loud knocking) - I'm coming. Drake, what happened? (heavy breathing) - Blankets, do you have some blankets? (heavy breathing) - Dad. You're so cold. You want some hot cocoa? - I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. - It's alright, it's alright. I'm Allison. - Julie. Here, I'll do this. Why don't you go get cleaned up? There's a bathroom right back over there. - Thanks. (heavy breathing) (classical music) Nice first impression, Allison. - Envy of the nation, time for those weekend barbecues. Meanwhile, the rest of the country will still be shivering-- - They keep saying the same stuff on the weather, but I'm hoping there's still more snow. - That's two days old, they're showing a tape of the news. - Back to you, Bill. (white noise fuzzing) - Communications broadcast test. If this were an actual emergency. (white noise fuzzing) - You would be told where to for information about your local area. This has been an emergency communications broadcast. - In an emergency, if this were an actual. (dramatic music) - Oh Drake, you're here. No, that's great. We were quite worried about you. A slight architectural flaw when I designed this place. The water in the pool is heated to 75 degrees and that's fine, it just tends to be that excursion from the pool to the backdoor that gets you. You look cold, may I offer you a glass? It's a Merlot. Well, cheers. (white noise fuzzing) - Just because my son lives with you doesn't mean you know what's best for him. - I know but you two. - You bet I did, you have no idea what you're dealing with. It's hell out. - Look, I know you're upset about Zapata and I am sorry-- - You should have gotten out of here when you had the chance. - Why would we want to leave this place? - What are we gonna do if the electricity goes off? - If we hadn't stayed here, you would be dead right now. Both Greg and-- - Greg, Greg is a pathetic loser. - I will not have you of all people-- - Okay, you guys, come on. Let's just stop it, okay, I mean, first of all he didn't really mean it-- - Yeah, I did mean that. - I think I would know better than you when he means something. - Come on Max, back to bed. - If we knew what was going on, we could construct some kind of a plan. Here you are. But the radio is out, the cellphone's out. Of course, I can't get online. I can't get anything on the radio. - The information age is over. - No, not at all. I know what's happening. And I'm the only one who can get us out alive. The government is evacuating key personnel. A ship's being sent to pick me up. - A ship to where? - Equatorial zone, quite livable. You stay here, you die here. This weather will last for years. - Years? That's not what we've been led to believe. - They've sent me a time to meet. Day after tomorrow at 7:00 p.m. - And which mid-level bureaucrat is in charge of this who lives who dies decision? - They told me I can bring anyone I want. - How long did they know that the weather would be this bad? - Wait, wait, wait. Didn't you say that we need to get to Malibu? - I mean that's 30 miles north of here. - No, no, no, we can't go north. I mean what if this ship doesn't arrive? In my opinion, if we leave here at all, I think that we need to head south. - I say we stay here. We have everything we need, right here. - Yeah, I agree. - Look, why don't we just sleep on it? (wind blowing) - Allison, we lost the heat. Electricity's out too. - Maybe I can help. (dramatic music) (wind blowing) - Help me with this (mumbles). (wind blowing) (loud grunting) - Let's get the flashlights, come on. - Allison, watch out for the glass. (wind blowing) (dramatic music) Kisler, get your ass down here and help. - Help me with this. - Hang on. - Grab that end. (glass breaking) - Are you alright? - Yeah, help me get it, pick it, pick it up. - Are you sure? - That car was a wreck when I bought it. I had completely rebuilt the engine myself. I think I must have ventured to 40 different scrap yards trying to salvage parts. The ones I couldn't buy I had custom machined. (sighing) - That's part of the first building he ever designed. - Well, now you can start again, designing igloos. - I'm gonna go get more stuff to burn. - Seriously, what use is architecture? - Please. - Or the law? Do we need lawyers now? Useless, policemen, useless. - Scientists? - Science wasn't able to get us out of this one, doctor. - The only one who's really useful is my dad. He was the one who knew how to make the fire. (sighing) - Drake, listen, even if there actually is a ship, you know, we have no way of getting to Malibu. - (Mumbles) there's a snow vehicle at the police station. If we can make it through the night first. I'm gonna leave as soon as the sun comes up. I want you to put together food, clothing, anything you think we can use. - Thank you. - Not those, and the books. - Uh no. - Give me those books. - No, not these ones. Listen, you don't understand, these aren't just books. These ones are art. - It's not art. That's fuel. Come on. (dramatic music) (wind blowing) (loud crashing) (suspenseful music) (quite stepping) (dramatic music) (heavy breathing) - Hey, anybody there, you're gonna let us out? Help, help let us out. - Screw you! Over here, come on man. You can't let us stay here and die. - Have a heart. - Visiting day so soon. - Yeah. - I'm telling you man, it was all a misunderstanding. - That's for the judge to decide, I was just doing my job. - Well, the judge hauled out with all your police friends. You're what's left. So tell me, is the penalty for this death? 'Cause that's what you're saying if you don't let us out. - Congratulations, you've all just been paroled. (dramatic music) - Hey. Dirty Harry, don't you walk away from me all smug. (loud rustling) Now, you're thinking. - Look, I really don't want to see you ever again. - What? Was that what we were about Mr. Drake, huh? You chase me, until I say I'll go to the prom with you. Then once we're there, you dance with everyone but me? I feel so used and dirty. - Get out of here before I change my mind. - Go where? Go outside in this (mumbles) outfit and half a blanket. What, is someone sending a limo for me? - I don't care where you go. - I'm going in that thing and you're taking me back to my girlfriend. - Right. - You're goddamn right I'm right. You're just gonna leave me here? Who made you in charge in who lives and-- - If you hadn't got yourself in trouble, you wouldn't be here anyway. - I was in front of my house trying to chase off some gang bangers from holding court on my lawn that I just received. Wouldn't you? Yeah I had a gun, wouldn't you? But I get arrested. Wouldn't you? No, no, you wouldn't. White people are allowed to protect their homes. - Yeah, I just feel like crying for persecuting you. - You ever drive one of those? 'Cause I was in the army reserve. I trained in those things. You don't strike me as the mechanical type. - You weren't in the army reserves, Calvin. - I was all I use to be in the army. - Wasn't on your rap sheet. - What is my rap sheet my autobiography? They don't put being in the reserve on your rap sheet. I do engage in other activities that might not make it into my trumped up police records you know. - Really? I don't know how there could have been any time for anything like that. - If you're gonna concentrate on driving, how you gonna keep an eye out to protect yourself from people like me, huh? - Yeah, well, we're both out of luck. There's no keys. - What? So. - Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa whoa. - I don't need keys to start an engine. They teach us in the public schools where I grew up. (engine revving) Uh, you want to get the garage door. (dramatic music) - Is that a compass? - Yeah. - It's very cool. - He doesn't know what he's doing. - Relax, Calvin was in the army. - I still think we should have gone south. I don't see why Drake should make all the decisions. - He makes everyone do things his way. - If you got a problem with that Greg, you can get out right now. - Look, we gotta stop. - I don't need your opinion. - No, I'm just the black guy driving. - Yeah. - I need another blanket. - Drake's personality isn't keeping you warm? - Look, I'm not talking about just stopping so I can cash my public assistance check-- - Don't make me put a bullet in you. - If it wasn't so crowded in here, we all would be better off. - And who do you suggest that we leave on the side of the road? - I don't mean this personally, but I'm surprised you came at all. - Dude without her, you would just be another block of ice floating down the LA river. (toy dog barking) - Max stop. - She's a nurse. Shouldn't she have found a relief center where her expertise is desperately needed, instead of deserting the sick? - You know, I should have killed you when I had the chance. (toy dog barking) - Enough. - Look, we gotta-- - Shut up, both of you. - Drake, I think the least that you can do is be civil. You know, I don't think there's any, Max, could you please put that damn thing away? I'm sorry. - My dad was right. You're nothing but a pathetic loser, Greg. - I mean I hate to break up this festival of love but somebody better keep an eye out for a gas station. Because we're stopping soon one way or another. (engine puttering) (dramatic music) (loud clicking) The needle was frozen, so what, put me back in jail. - Hey I didn't put you in jail, you put yourself there when you decided to break the law. - You got a receipt for the rifles in this ride? - No Max, stay inside. I'm gonna go see if I can find anything, even approaching a decent ladies room. - Take this with you. - What's this for? - In case there's a lion. Just pull back that lever, flip the safety and watch out for the kick. - You don't think I'm really gonna need this, do you? - Go with her. - No, I have seen all too often what guns can do. Forget it. - Just fire off a round in case there's any trouble, okay. (sighing) (dramatic music) - Let me try. - Hey, stop banging on that thing. You're just gonna dent it. It's frozen solid. - So how long you been seeing Drake? - A couple months, why? - I see him every other week and he's never mentioned you before. (laughing) - Nice Julie, here I was trying to figure out why Drake divorced you. Is someone in there? (grunting) (dramatic music) Asphyxiation, they left their heater on until they ran out of gas. - Ugh. (heavy breathing) - Julie, Julie, Julie? (engine revving) - What are you doing with our bus? - We're police officers okay. We're waiting for all of our friends who are all police officers, so we can plant some evidence or something. - Eh, our apologies. We didn't realize it was yours. We'll gladly trade you something. We need some fuel for the APC. - Oh yeah, what are you doing with our APC? - Hey, hey, listen, my son is in there. Let me get him out and we'll be out of your way. - Yeah. - Max, come on, we gotta go. Just jump into your dad's arms. Okay, come on. Come on, let's go, let's go. (gunshots firing) (woman screaming) - Hey. (gunshots firing) - Drake, get me out of here! (gunshots firing) - Drake, give me a gun. Come on man, give me a gun. (gunshots firing) Give me a gun. - Not a chance. (gunshots firing) (glass breaking) Ahh. (suspenseful music) - Just (mumbles), don't just stand there. (gunshots firing) - Ah, ah. - I killed him. - Self defense. I handed those cases all the time, come on. (gunshots firing) - Ah, ah. (glass breaking) (woman screaming) - Don't shoot, don't shoot me (screams). Get me out of here, get me out. (suspenseful music) (gun cocking) - Get down. (gunshot firing) (wind blowing) Stupid chump. - Max. - Dad. - You alright there? - Yeah, I'm fine dad. - Okay. (dramatic piano music) (woman crying) - No, it's not even mine. Listen, come here, it's okay, it's alright. We have to go this way, come on. - I'm okay mom, it's okay. - Ah. Ah. (dramatic music) - Ouh. - I apologize, it'll just take a minute. - Stop crying, what's your name? - Jessica. - Hold still. Max, don't look, sit down. - Max, come here. - This is good. There's entrance and exit wounds, but I've got to stop this bleeding. - You better pray that I stay alive. Without me, they'll never let you on the boat. - You better pray there is a boat, 'cause I'll haul you out and crawl inside before I freeze to death. - Guys, this thing is starting to sound my grandpa's pickup. We gotta stop, we gotta stop or it's just gonna stall. - Find some place to pull it in, we're never gonna get it fixed out in this stuff. - We can fix this thing in my girlfriend's garage man. - We're not going to Venice Beach, Calvin. - I have tools here. - Who asked you? - We're gonna die. We're all being punished and we're going to die. - Find some place, please. - Yeah, okay, fine, whatever man, whatever. (ambient music) - Whoever blew this bank was dumber than paint. Help me with this thing. - I'll get the (mumbles). - Make a fire. - Wait a second, I'll give you a hand. - Dad, I think someone's here. - Max, get over here. (woman screaming) Come on, come on get inside. - Julie, get in. (gun cocking) (suspenseful music) - Is this it? - Yes, that's the one, thank you. - Hi. Take a peek. (fire crackling) (dramatic music) - I'm sorry. (dramatic music) - You think you can fix it, Greg? - I'm working on it. - We don't have room for more strays. - Hey. I wanna thank you. You saved me life. - Yeah, yeah, after the thaw, just go ahead and add it to my rap sheet. (dramatic music) - We've been here for hours. I never thought to burn the money. - I thought you said you rebuilt your car. - Yes I did, however, I had manuals. I had parts. - I need more blankets. - You're not the only one who's cold. - But I'm the only one who's bleeding. - I have another box with some sonic wrenches. - Alright, I'll get it. - Drake, I don't actually believe that Calvin was in the army. - Said, if we get out of this, I wouldn't mind taking your case myself. - Hey, don't worry, Drake, I won't hold that, what was it? - Wrongful imprisonment. - Right, right, wrongful imprisonment. I won't hold that wrongful imprisonment against you. - You get the other tools. - He thanks a lot for setting Max straight about Greg. - Hey, he's grown up. He's entitled to his own opinion. To his opinion or to yours? - What do you see in him? - He actually believes that Calvin was something other than a fraud. - Yeah, Greg isn't like you, Drake, he likes people. He believes the best about them. - Yeah. That's weakness. - No, that's his strength. - My parents are really religious. My dad's like this always smiling alder man or something. When stuff like this happens, I just hate them even more. - I don't think you hate them. I think that you're probably worried about them now. - Well, I'm not. - Did they really throw you out? You ran away? Why, Jessica? - I tried to call them and tell them not to worry about me, but the phones were out in Sacramento. - Are you pregnant, is that why you ran away? - Please don't tell anybody. - Plan on having a duel with me there, huh Greg? - I didn't realize you were going to bring in arsenal. - What is this half this stuff? - That's mine, thank you. (dramatic music) I don't know why, I suppose I had to save something. Something of civilization. I guess I thought everyone would save a volume of Shakespeare, but who would save Dante? We've lost all the hydraulic fluid. We can't replace it. - Appropriate choice Dante, in the fourth frame of the ninth circle. A last stop in hell, he describes the worst possible punishment, the people there are sealed in ice. - Right, well book club's over, doctor. How we gonna get this thing going? - The elevators. You will find the hydraulic fluid in the elevators. - The white man brought us here in chains. The white man brought drugs into our neighborhoods. The white man sent bombs and missiles up into space and stuff, which caused the greenhouse effect and made the atmosphere so hot, that it got cold. - Yeah, the white man made it snow. - Sure, he's white, he likes things white. The government made it snow so it'd be easier to spot decent black folks and round them up. - If you weren't concerned with the rhetoric of oppression, maybe people would take you seriously. - Excuse me, I'm gonna need some more of this fluid. - Come on. - Yeah, well maybe I should have saved all my money up from that minimum wage job and opened up a boutique or something. You want serious friend, we're going through Venice. - No, we're not. And you may have saved my life, but that does not make you my friend. - Yeah, well, think about it. I'm your favorite adult male on this trip. Who else, Greg's an elitist. Kisler's got that whole today Malibu, tomorrow the world thing going on. And the new rich guy is just plain spooky. So if we're the last ones alive, you and me are gonna be hanging together, friend. (dramatic music) - Drake, I'm gonna need to replace some of this wire. - Yeah, I brought some. I brought some. - Do you need some help? - No, I know I brought some wire. I must have set it down. - Will this work? - Uh, that's okay, we'll be fine. Thank you, Max, this is great, this will work fine. Thank you. (fire cracking) - When Gretchen's father passed away, he left a sizable legacy, for the Brentwood Presbyterian Hospital. Carter Pavilion was dedicated last March. And there's a plaque above the entrance, a five by seven inch plaque, bearing his name. It's bronze, it's very tasteful, yet when my wife and I brought our little Lisa to the Carter Pavilion at the Brentwood Presbyterian Hospital, they turned us away. I'm a bond broker you know. I've amassed what most people would consider a fortune, and that's it. That's my life's work right here. But I'm gonna tell you something, I thank God that's here right now, keeping us warm instead of in some five by seven inch plaque at the Brentwood Presbyterian Hospital. Yeah. That's all I have to say. (sighing) (dramatic music) Gretchen, please honey, Gretchen. Please, Gretchen. Oh Gretchen. (suspenseful music) Oh Gretchen. (dramatic music) - I didn't see him leave. I woke up and found her dead on the floor, so I picked up the coat. - Take it off. - Someone should have it, why not me? - We don't have room. - You can try it now. (engine revving) (dramatic music) - It sounds pretty good, Greg, you did a great job. - Thank you. - What? (dramatic music) - Dad, I think there's something wrong with my compass. - Let me see that. - I'm gonna go to find my girlfriend. - What are you talking about? - He's crazy, we'll never make it to the ship. - Calvin-- - Stop him. - Turn us around in the right direction. - This is the right direction. - Turn now. - Calvin. - Too late, we're here. (dramatic music) - I thought you said we were going to your neighborhood. - This is my neighborhood. - Seven o'clock, the ship leaves at seven. - Come on, let's go. - She could be here. Help me man, help me. - Maybe she got out on time, I'm sorry. (loud punching) - You did this to me, I could have been there with her. I might have saved her man. - Please, half of the human population is dead by now. All our friends, all our families. - Just shut up before I kill you. - Whatever happened to them was their responsibility, not mine, it makes me want to live even more. And now get in, before we all die because of you. (engine revving) - That things going down, come on, let's go. (dramatic music) Come on. (dramatic orchestra music) - We don't have time for this nonsense. The ship won't wait for us. - We're not gonna just live him there to die. (dramatic music) (man yelling) - Come on, let's get (mumbles). - (Mumbles) come on. - (Mumbles). - A number of men are injured. - I have a bad feeling about this. - Yeah. - I'm a nurse. - Over there. - Do you have supplies ma'am? - With triage. - Start here. - We flew through some intense hail back there a couple of miles. As you can see, it tore us up pretty bad. - You guys got another unit around? - No, not that we know of. There's no chain of command. Pentagon stopped transmitting orders yesterday. - Well, what about the President? - He's dead. Went down two days ago on Air Force One. - No, I'd like you to stay here and look after Jessica, alright. (grunting) - That's it, just press down hard, that's it. - What the hell you people doing out here anyway? Aren't you headed in the wrong direction? - We got a science expert with us, we're headed up the old naval base north of Malibu. The government's sending a ship to pick him up at 1900 hour. - A ship? - Why's he so important? - He's the only one with a pocket calculator. - We can't (mumbles) to Malibu in three hours. - Well, we can catch a ride with them, sir. - Listen, we don't have room for all your men. But if we got rid of our gear, I think we can make room for your wounded. We'll take them up, send help back. - Sounds like a good plan. - Let me see what you got. (dramatic music) - Assemble the men, sergeant. - What do you have in mind, sir? (dramatic music) - No, what are you doing? - Max, don't. - Stop. - Get away! - Oh no, hey. (suspenseful music) - Kisler! - Give me that, hold your fire, hold your fire. (gunshots firing) - Wait, stop, my son's in there. (gunshots firing) (suspenseful music) (grunting) (gunshot firing) (dramatic music) (grunting) - Max, are you okay? - Are you alright. - Thank god. (heavy breathing) - Why? - The ship was sent for me alone. You were never being allowed to go on. I'm the important one, you are nothing, nothing. (dramatic music) - Do really think if we get to the ship, they're not gonna let us on? - No, they'll have to. Don't tell the others. - Now, there's room for one more. I'll take my weapon. - Make as much space as you can. We'll get our wounded ready. - I've been in a lot of negotiations. This one's going south. - Sir, that is not your problem. - Sergeant, assemble the units. Fall in men. - There's too many of them, I say we make a run of it. - Fall in now, listen up. We're gonna load our wounded, and then the rest of us are gonna hunker down (mumbles). - Sir, why don't they hunker down here? - (Mumbles) wounded and children to freeze in the cold. I'm sorry. - No lieutenant, I'm sorry. (gunshot firing) - Get inside, everybody get inside, let's go. Get in. - What are we waiting for, let's take that thing. - Quick. - Alright. (gunshots firing) - Get down, get down. (gunshots firing) - Greg. (gunshots firing) (man yelling) (gunshots firing) - Get back inside. - Can I help you? Uh. - Allison. - Stay down. - Get her inside, get her. Get her inside. - Come on, get in. Put your leg up. - That's it, I've got you. - Hell. (dramatic music) - Come on. Get in. (grunting) - Max, up front, watch your leg. (dramatic music) - It's a miracle, it's a miracle. (dramatic music) (engine puttering) - Okay, just leave it, just leave it. (heavy breathing) (engine puttering) (dramatic music) - It's all torn up under here. This is bad. (wind blowing) - Calvin, why don't you show Jessica and Max what's wrong, maybe they can come up with some ideas. - Come on Max, come on. Come on Jessica, come on, come on. - You've got about a mile left, but you've only got a couple hours. You're gonna have to leave right now. Allison can make it, if you help her. I'll stay here. - No, no Drake, we're not gonna leave you here by yourself. - Alright, come on. That's it. (door closing) - You know you can't make it with me. You're losing time right now. - Well, then I'll just stay, I'll stay with here. - They'll need you. - But you might need me. - I don't love you Allison. I didn't want those to be my parting words, and I don't meant to hurt you. I just don't love you so much. (dramatic music) - Yeah, well, I don't love you too. (dramatic music) - We'll make it. I promise. Oh god. Here. I think this should do, run quite nicely. - Come here, son. I want you to go with mom and Greg alright. Catch up with you guys later. - Okay. - When you get to the ship, you give that to Allison. Wait til you get to the ship though, alright. Alright, give me a hug. Alright, go on. Okay, go. (dramatic music) (heavy breathing) They gotta make it. Gotta make it. (dramatic music) - Okay. Come on, get up. (heavy breathing) - The ship, the ship is going to come. He said it would come. - God, I wish Kisler was alive so I could beat him to hell. - There's not going to be any ship. - It's all frozen solid. - We can't give up now. - We just left him back there. He's back there alone and he hates the cold so much. There's not going to be any ship (cries). (dramatic music) We gotta go back for him. - What if it comes? - Even if it does come, I don't think they're gonna take us. - What do you mean? - Kisler lied to us. He lied to us to get us to bring him here. Then he said that they were only gonna take him. (heavy breathing) (dramatic music) (loud cracking) (suspenseful music) - Which of you is Kisler, Dr. Norman Kisler? - He is. - Welcome aboard. - Yes, thank you. - Captain Parker, this is First Officer Lane. - Captain, we left a man. - Guys, give him some help. - Medic, this woman's sick. - Come on ma'am, just sit her down right here. - Get some food for these people, make sure that (mumbles). - Yes sir, I shall do it myself. - Captain. - Yes sir. - Do you have any form of snow transportation on board this vessel? - We do, but I'm not losing anymore personnel to this cold. - I see, there is a man that we left behind. He's not far. - I'm sorry doctor, we are here for 45 minutes, awaiting orders. If we don't receive them, we move one before this ice encases us. - Yeah, but please-- - Listen, do you realize who you're saying no to? - I don't think that your superiors are gonna be too happy about this. - I wish I could help you Dr. Kisler. Your friends are more than welcome. As it is, we had 200 scheduled picks up, out of which we now have 35 passengers. First officer will show you to your quarters. - Captain, I'm sorry sir, I'm afraid I can't accept that answer. - There is no other answer Dr. Kisler. - Listen up your starched shirt underwater Popeye bastard, the man who saved us is out there freezing to death about a mile from here. - He was a navy seal, sir. - He's that kid's father, that woman's ex and that woman's current. And if you're not gonna send one of your pack of cowards to go get him, give me the equipment and I'll go myself. If you can't spare the equipment, let me off now, I'll walk by and drag him here. If you want to leave without me, fine, I'll take that chance. - I'll go with him, sir. - You see, what have you got to worry about? I'm not gonna steal your equipment. Dr. Kisler's coming with me. He'll sign for the damages. (dramatic music) - Please. (dramatic music) - Wayne, instruct these gentlemen in the use of our snow mobiles. (engine revving) (dramatic music) (engine revving) - Surely, you can wait a few minutes for Dr. Kisler. - I know he's not Kisler. No matter who he is, we're leaving whether he's back or not. - My dad asked me to give these to you. (dramatic music) (engines revving) - Drake, we're here, we made it. - He's in the submarine, man. He's real crazy. - Get down. - Ah. (gunshots firing) (grunting) (dramatic music) - So you guys gonna get me out of here? I'd sit around and read, but this damn thing's in Italian. - That's the only way to read, Dante. - Yeah, what are you, ignorant or something? - Come on, let's get out of here. (dramatic music) - Hey (mumbles). - I think we can find a wire to fix him. Don't think that should be too difficult. They say it's nice there, Drake. Maybe you can chase me around in some Bermuda shorts or something. (laughing) - Hey, nice and warm for you. - Oh I (mumbles) cold. I'm telling you it was the wind. - Yeah, whatever, right. - Come on. (dramatic music) You know I use to think that I liked you because you were so tough. But now I know I love you because you're not. (dramatic music) - I'll take those back. - Uh hmm (laughs). (dramatic music) (ambient music)
