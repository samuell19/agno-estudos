This design is beautiful. lt suits you. Besides, it's not too flashy for everyday wear. lt's our last pair. Hey, Chun, take a look at these rings. Tell me which pair you like best. These are my favorite, but there's no discount. These are nice too. This pair is the cheapest, and there's a 20% discount. The first pair is the best, but it's too expensive. The second pair isn't bad either. They have a pretty nice design. lt's really hard to decide. Chun, which pair? You decide. - l want the most expensiÂ¤e pair. - The ones without the discount? lt's not a big deal, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. l promise you won't regret it. What's that? Bomb! Bomb! Run! You have to try on that suit later. Don't be late. Open fire! Let's go. SlX MONTHS LATER What's up? Chun, take a look at these rings. Tell me which pair you like best. - l want the most expensive pair. - The ones without the discount? lt's not a big deal, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. - l promise you won't regret it. - You've got no shame! You have to try on that suit later. Don't be late. l was working late last night. Yeah! Finished? Finished, right? lt's your turn now. How many today, sir? - Give me a kiss. - You're bad. Don't worry about it. What do you want this time? l've told you many times already, l didn't kill my wife. lf you don't have enough evidence, then get out. Pour a glass of red wine for the inspector. You've probably never tasted a bottle of red wine worth over 30,000 HK dollars. Cops like you probably never had the chance. Red is no good. lt reeks of blood. lf you have evidence, arrest me. Otherwise, don't even mess with me! That assassin you hired, we arrested him in Macau yesterday. Next time you hire someone, don't hire gamblers. See for yourself. The whole thing for 300,000 HK dollars. Loan shark Cheng asked me to kill his wife for him. Officer, l'm willing to testify against him. Damn you! Let go! My finger! Let go of me! Does it hurt? Assaulting a police officer? More years in the slammer for you. Put that steak in a bag for him. l just went inside to get something. lt hasn't even been a minute. Come on. Save me some face, here. Sir, you're illegally parked. Don't you know who l am? Your District Commander Wong, he plays mahjong with me every night. He even calls me Brother Blackie. You're still writing that ticket? l don't see you catching a thief. 320 HK dollars is nothing to me. l bet tens of thousands on a horserace. l can pelt you to death just with my horseracing winnings. Look at my rims, they're worth more than your monthly salary. No wonder you're a lowly patrolman your whole life. Here's your ticket for illegal parking. l can also add on a charge for littering and insulting a police officer. Would you like that? Let's go, son. - lt smells. Let's go. - Don't look. lt's so disgusting. Sir. Sir! - P.C. 5299 calling Control. - Go ahead. Requesting ambulance, unconscious man found. No visible injuries. Location is Zetland Street in Central. Roger. ls he dead? He smells. Sir, are you okay? Don't worry. The ambulance is on its way. - Six. - Right. - Have you eaten? - Yes. l kissed someone today. You're a grown-up now. These things happen. Bring her over for dinner sometime. lt was a guy. Guys have to eat too. lt was a homeless guy. l saved him by giving him CPR. Oh. Don't even bother. There hasn't been a letter or call. Granny, have you ever considered that Tat won't ever come back? lt's all up to fate. The day your parents died in that car crash, l never considered that either. l know. You said l was three at the time and Tat was six. Yes, l took you two to the hospital. You even had a fever then. lt's been 20 years. Granny. Anyway, no matter where your brother is, no matter what he is doing, as long as he believes in it he has my support. l remember he once told me to be a good cop. That's right. You didn't get any sleep last night? How are you going to work? Didn't l already ask my wife to get you some sleeping pills? You'll be fine after you pop two. Cousin, l already took a whole bottle. Don't call me cousin when we're working. Call me lnspector Wong. The way l see it, you're going to be in some serious trouble one of these days. l don't get it. lvy's been dead for six months. What's the matter with you? lf you want to resurrect her, then dig up her body. A few drops of blood plus a talisman and you can have your own ghost girlfriend. Stop thinking about revenge all the time. A cop shouldn't think like that! How about this? l'll transfer you to a desk job starting next month. You not feeling well, cousin? Your breath stinks. lnspector Wong, lnspector Wong, the tiger is in the den. The target's nickname is Tiger. He is suspected of supplying arms for recent robberies. The guns are from Thailand. That bastard even went to the terminal yesterday to get the guns. Double Seven, Pun, the target is approaching you. Everyone wait for my orders. Sister, how much for an orange? Not for sale, go away. How do you do business? This is ridiculous. - That idiot. - Hey! You're crazy! Watch out! Open the door. Hurry up, start the car! lt's only a robbery? Here, take my money. Drive faster! Police! Stop! Stop! lgnore him! Keep driving! Turn here! Faster! Police. Get out. Stand up. What's wrong with you? l didn't say go. At least give me a heads-up when you decide to make a move! At least let me have some mental preparation, cousin! Don't think you are the only cop in Hong Kong who can catch a thief. Sir, l have heart problems. l'm going to sue him. We can talk about that later. Let me call an ambulance for you right now. - Hurry. - Yeah. Sir, congratulations! You are going to be interviewed next week for promotion again. My old buddy Dickson wants to transfer over to learn from you. Their unit got into deep shit again today. There's a guy called Chan Chun. He's really aggressive, but kind of crazy. He's always getting them in trouble. Chan Chun? l've heard of him. Useless. When you're a cop, being aggressive is not enough. You have to use your head. Only one type of person can survive in this world: those who are capable. You ever hear anyone talk about useless people? Yes, sir. Police. Please turn off the engine and show me your license. Turn off the engine and get out. All of you get out now. You hear me? Sorry, sorry. l know we were going too fast. My wife is about to give birth. l have to get her to hospital. Please! Honey, hang on, this'll be quick. l'm sorry, Officer. Give me another chance. lt won't happen again. The driver went the wrong way just now. Sorry. Sir, his wife is about to give birth. - She's about to give birth? - Yes. - Don't drive so fast. - l know. - Go. - Thank you. Thank you. Jin. Go and check them out. Yes, sir. Your l.D., please. Get out of the car! Hands on your head! You hear me? Let go of him! Get out now! Put the knife down. Let go of him. Don't try anything funny. You're pretty sly. Luckily l'm not that dumb. There are hidden compartments, cousin. Of course. l know that. Hidden compartments. You little bastard. What are you doing? Police are working here. Move along if you have no business here. Put down your guns. Stay away from me. Let me go! Let me go, hurry! l said let me go! Let me go or l'm going to die! l said put down your guns. Hurry up and let me go! Help me! Let's go. Boss, l had nothing to do with it. l'm not the one you want. - Go. - l'm sorry. l really didn't know it would turn out like this. l only took my share of the money. lf you want it l can give it to you. The people you want... go and look for them. Get up. lt's been six months. Do you know what we've been through? Tell us! Where's the money? l don't know. l didn't sell you out. l was just responsible for giving you the explosives. l didn't know you were going to use it to rob an armored truck. Listen, we risked our lives. But we won't let other people risk it for us. Who's the buyer? Why did he double-cross us? You were the ones who robbed the armored truck six months ago? l asked you if you were the ones that robbed the truck. Cousin. Asshole. You have the guts to do it, but you don't have the guts to admit it? Get down! l really don't know. Killing me won't do you any good. l really don't know. Go find Ho Wing Keung. l really don't know anything. Ho Wing Keung? Go down there and keep my brother company. Sir, please don't wash those bullets. We need to take them for tests. Sir, you swallowed three bullets. Are they all in there? Count them yourself. lf there are any missing, you can fish them out yourself. - Sorry, sir. - All right? Let's go. ls it that funny? What are you laughing at? ls there nothing here to do? You that bored? - Get out of here! - We're leaving, sir. Don't help me. How are the others? Jin was stabbed three times. Wounds are pretty deep. He's still in critical condition. The other guys should be discharged in a couple of days. Don't get mad, l made you some soup. Soup? When did l ask you to make soup? Have you checked out the robbers that l asked you to? We're looking into it, but l wanted to see how you were doing first. See? What's there to see? Can't even get some information, and you say you're from lntelligence. Why don't you go? Go. Fellow officers, the chief is very concerned about the two assault cases on the officers. The purpose of this meeting is to discuss how we can apprehend the culprits. You have in your hands details of the fugitive Tien Yeng Seng. Tien Yeng Seng is the mastermind, Tien Yeng Yee is second-in-command. They are the ones who robbed an armored vehicle six months ago. They disappeared after taking 1 00 million US dollars. According to intelligence from lnterpol, police from Thailand, Vietnam, and Cambodia have all been after them over the last six months. They surfaced again last night, this time in Hong Kong. These seven orphans grew up together during wartime. After finishing their military training, they formed a mercenary gang and created havoc. The last time we encountered them we took down three. The special operation we assembled this time will be under S.P.s Law and Wong. C.l. Sam will be assisting in the investigation. Yes, sir. Actually, l have already applied for early retirement. lncluding vacation time, l only have about a month left. Sir, let me handle it. Six months ago these people committed a crime in my district. Good, that's settled, then. You brothers will be working together. We're leaving it in your hands. No problem, sir. ln fact, l'm honored. You're good, holding on to 336. Of course, l told you to do the same. You won't listen. Driving a nice car, living in a nice home-- just beware of the anti-corruption guys. Don't talk nonsense. Cheung, you're really attached. You still keeping that piece ofjunk? Why don't you throw it away? l haven't driven it for a while, so it's just sitting here. - lt's an old car. - But it's not bad. This is S.P. Law, our commander for this operation. Sit. On August 25th, 2006, there was an armored truck robbery in Central, three dead and 1 6 injured. 1 00 million US dollars were stolen. Yesterday, six officers were assaulted and injured at Kowloon Bay. Two officers are still in intensive care. Today, Sham Shui Po, an arms smuggler, was killed. Eight more officers were injured. Officer Wai King Tat is a suspect. That's why we hope you can give us some information on your brother, or any other information that can help us solve the case. My brother wouldn't do that. You are a police officer. l'm sure you know you are obligated to aid us in our investigation. During his disappearance, did Wai King Tat try to contact you in any way? No. Did anything unusual happen, or do you have any information you can give us that can help us find your brother? No. You're in an awkward situation. Take some time off. lf you have any news of Tat, notify us immediately. Don't forget, you are still a police officer. Can l ask you a question in private, sir? - Leave us. - Yes, sir. What do you want to ask me? Before my brother left, he said he had an important mission. Did he go undercover? You should know better. Tat is a suspect now. Until the case is solved, everything is classified. Sorry, sir. But if that is true, a commanding officer should protect his men. A commanding officer should protect his men. He's not my man anymore. Whatever road he chooses, it's his problem. l know what my brother's like. Sorry. You know what he's like. No matter how good he was before, if he wanted to turn bad it would be really easy. That's all l have to say. HEROlC lNSPECTOR FONG YlK WEl EXCRETES BULLETS TO SAVE HlMSELF Shit! Don't think about it. Serious cases will take over. They brought in a patrolman, Wai King Ho, for questioning. Apparently his brother is connected to the robbers. Wai King Ho. Wai King Ho? Which precinct is he with? Call me if you have any information. Hey! Hey! Don't do anything stupid! Your outside sources won't do anything. Leave it to our other colleagues. Hey, cousin, do you understand what l'm saying? Don't try to be a hero! What's up? l'm looking for your brother, Wai King Tat. Where is he? Boy! Don't think you're okay if you don't talk. You're not going anywhere till you say something. You're looking for my brother too? Don't pretend. How many, sir? lt's okay. lced tea, please. lced coffee. lced lemon tea. l know. You're Carson Fong from Eastern. And you're that Chan Chun who always gets into brawls. Sirs, what have you found after following me all this time? Wai King Ho, where is your brother? Your brother is involved in several big cases. Hand him over. l already told the organized crime bureau everything. l'm a cop, not a suspect. Your brother is a criminal. So you're not so innocent yourself. l'm warning you, if l find out you're withholding information, l'm locking you up myself. Your brother has changed. lf people find out about him, you'd be disgraced. l'm telling you, your brother is like this glass of milk. lt's already changed colors. Dummy, don't you get it? l believe my brother is still a good cop. l know your girlfriend died six months ago because of these guys. And you want revenge. And you want to take it out on someone. Neither of you are fit to be good cops. - My business is none of yours. - My business is none of yours. Hey, kid. Who's asking the questions here? lf you still have bullets up your ass, the bathroom is over there. - Terry Dog is here. - Boss. - Hey, O.D. - Terry. Get out. l don't want you here. Get out. Come with me. We'll pretend nothing has happened. Terry, what's your problem? How many times have l said no? Go home. l'm not spending the rest of my life with you. At least pick someone better, you loser. Your brother Pao is in the hospital because he ate his goods. You're not like that, are you? l'm getting blamed because Pao ate his pills? My horoscope matches him better than yours. l'm Gemini and you're Capricorn; we're not compatible. Go home, you talk too much. Okay, fine. We got nothing more to talk about. lf we can't settle this, let's just leave it. Talk with you? - You got no business. - Mind your own business. O.D., save me some face, don't start anything. Please talk outside. Help! Stop it! You, let him go. Police. What's going on here? Show me your l.D.s. Up against the wall! Your friend? You okay, Officer? l thought you were a Junior Police Officer. l'm charging you with illegal assembly, assault, and coercing a minor. Up against the wall and hand over your l.D.s. You're acting pretty tough. Come show us then, Officer. Don't tease the officer. Look, he's so scared he's going to cry. So what if you're a cop? Don't think l'm scared just because you're the police. Now l'm calling you a piece of trash. And l'm calling you a useless cop, so what? Get out of here, cop! Yeah, scram, Officer! l'm adding a new charge for insulting an officer. You better watch it. Look, he's throwing a fit. What? What are you going to do? How's that? Your l.D. is up here. Come and get it, pig cop! Attack! Hey! Get him! l'm a cop too. What did you call us cops just now? l said you were trash. But l only said that because l failed the police entrance exam. l'm still bearing a grudge. Let's go. Are you crazy? Let's get out of here! Thank you. Are you stupid? Follow me. Hello, Report Center. There's a fight on Star Street. How come there are no officers? Here. This ointment is priceless. You can try some. ls this your brother's room? Yeah. lt hurts. Wai King Ho. Thanks. Don't try be a hero if you can't stand pain. You should be glad you're still alive. lt's the duty of a policeman to maintain order in society, to preserve justice, to protect the lives and property of the citizens. Stop faking. Why did you two help me, then? Had it not been for me, you would've been stabbed from behind several times already. ln that situation we should just let them kick each other's asses first and then call our colleagues to come and take out the dead. That would've been smarter. So your brother was the one who held the shooting record. Useless now. l broke his record last year. And don't put out runner-up trophies. That's just embarrassing. That judo trophy was my brother's favorite. He enjoyed the contest. Even third meant something. What do you know? What do l know? That's loser talk. Who doesn't want to win? Dummy. Hey, where is your brother? l told you l don't know. Your wound is very deep. You're crazy! Not so hard! My back hurts a little. Are the wounds serious? You'll live. Help me real quick. Don't do it so hard. Not so hard, it hurts. Granny, you're back. These are my colleagues Chan Chun and Fong Yik Wei. You guys... - Fell down. - Car crash. Chasing crooks. So, how's the investigation? The suspects tried to flee to Thailand the same night after that job. But they were caught by SDU at Tai O Pier. Three died, the other four escaped. They only reappeared last night when they assaulted you and killed Tiger. What about Tiger? What's his connection to them? Tiger was brought in for questioning. The police suspected that the gang was being supplied by Tiger, but there wasn't enough evidence to charge him. Also, all the guards who were on the route died except for the supervisor Ho Wing Keung, but he's now insane. Doctors said he suffered a mental breakdown. He's been admitted into an asylum and hasn't shown any signs of improvement. Ho Wing Keung is your cousin? He's in special care unit, upstairs to the left. But he can't recognize anyone anymore. Still, you can always try. Thanks. Brother, drinking water is good. From the look on your face, your illness is pretty serious. But l don't think there's anything wrong with your memory. Who was the mastermind? Who betrayed us? Tell me. Are you afraid to speak because you also had a part in it? l recently went to visit your wife. The kids are growing up fast. lt was your son who told me you were here. This place isn't bad. Pleasant surroundings. Better than jail. But your family isn't so fortunate. Always hiding. They're living an inhuman life. Brother, there's the police. Run! Ho Wing Keung, you should really appreciate your family. They've stuck by you through your six months of illness. We're different. We have no family. Stop. Don't move! Let go! But we are seven brothers. Brother! Now there's only four of us left. Since the robbery, the patient has suffered post-traumatic stress. He's not only lost his memory, he doesn't even react to external factors. Who betrayed us? Kitty, is Ho Wing Keung in his room? No, he's in the lounge. He has a cousin visiting. Shit! - What's up? - Mind your own business. Could it be someone from OCTB? Why would someone from OCTB pretend to be his cousin? Ho Wing Keung. Don't scare him. Don't be afraid. We're the police. Do you remember a robbery from six months ago? The suspects have reappeared. lf you have any information on them, please let us know. l don't care if you're really crazy or just faking it. You're in grave danger now. They already killed Tiger, you're next. You think about it. lf you're really clean, they wouldn't be looking for you. Speak. There's a bomb. There's a bomb. There's a bomb. Bomb! That's my car. Hey, why are you in my car? Hurry up! Safety belt. Watch out for the people. That asshole was faking it. Mental patients are quite energetic. Did you think l wouldn't be able to find you just because you faked insanity? Where are my wife and kids? Relax, you'll meet them soon. My money's in a safe. l'll give it all to you. Just don't harm my family. l don't want your money, l just want ours. Call him. l haven't seen him since that night. l don't know how to reach him. Who is he? Fine. l'll tell you once l know my family is safe. Up front. There are some wounded. Call for an ambulance. Don't worry, the ambulance is on its way. How is the traffic? My leg! My leg! Hang on, man. Hang on, sir. Retreat. Some are wounded. Get out. Get out of the car. Stop. Ho Wing Keung. Get out of the car. Bastard. You've been working with them this entire time? Do you know how many lives you're responsible for? They have my wife and kids. l have to save them. They're just kids, you crazy bastard! Hey, kids, don't look. Get down. Kneel over here! l promised you... l will tell you everything when l see my family. l promise you, l really will. So he was the one who betrayed you six months ago. But it's useless for you to hold him. You can see he doesn't have the guts to steal your money. So what if you kill him? ls that going to make you a hero? You're an interesting cop. l feel like you've known me for a long time. Oh wait, l haven't really answered your question. l was the one who committed the robbery six months ago. So? Six months ago a woman was out shopping for some rings... wedding rings. She's dead now because of these robbers. You killed her. You all killed her. She was my fiancÃ©e. So you wanted to avenge your girlfriend. You and l aren't so different after all. The seven of us grew up in an orphanage together. But you cops killed three of our brothers. You're murderers and robbers. You have no right to accuse us. lf l let you go now, wouldn't you want to kill me too? So it's okay for cops to kill? l vowed that... you would die a horrible death. You think you can kill me? l believe so. Because l believe there's justice in this world. lf you can't even live past the next second, how would you know there's justice in this world? Where is justice? l can't even find it now. Where was justice when l was starving? l get justice through my own bare hands. Remember, you have to have the ability. You promised your woman, and l made a vow to my brothers. lf there is justice in this world... then l hope we can both keep our promises. What's the point of all this rambling? l dare you to let the kids go. You look like you're about to eat me. l don't blame you for being so pissed off. You're taking it personal. You're not being professional. Professional, my ass! You're inhuman. Being human is not important. Surviving is. Take this. You look like my brother... but you don't act like him. My brother was a good man. He's called Wai King Tat. Do you know him? He's a cop. Undercover cop, right? Where is he? Where is he?! l already told you he was undercover. Do you think he would still be alive? l killed him. But your brother didn't suffer. l only took one shot. Why? Why did you have to kill him? Why? l promise l'll put you behind bars! lf you want revenge, you can come after me. l admired your brother, l really did. Had he not been a cop, we could have been good friends right now. Actually, you look very much like your brother. You must be some kind of role model cop. But let me tell you... the person who betrayed your brother... is also a cop. Honey. - Daddy! - Keung! Daddy. - Daddy, l missed you. - You're a good boy. What's happened to you? - lt's nothing, just a misunderstanding. - You told me to wait six months. You said everything would be fine in six months. Everything's fine now. Let me tie up some loose ends. l'll be home in a few days. Okay? Don't worry. Keung, don't leave us. There's some money in the safe deposit box. Take it. Go home and be good, okay? - Be good, listen to Mom. - Come back soon. l'll be back once everything's taken care of. Take good care of him, okay? - Come back soon. - Okay. Remember, listen to your mommy or l'll spank you when l come back. Hurry back, Keung! The phone number is 9238-0906. lt's hard to get hold of you. Not getting rid of all of us at Tai O Pier last time was a big mistake. Enough bullshit. We only want our money back. Show up at the Tamar Carnival with the money yourself. l'm not returning empty-handed this time. Take the money there and wait for me in one hour. Don't try anything funny. Don't make me go get you at the police station. Give me back my phone! You wanna die? What are you doing? Are you inhuman? lt's up to your friend. lf he's not here within an hour... Kids, which of you has a hairclip? A hairclip for pinning the hair. You have the money ready? Good, wait for me at the Ferris wheel. Remember, if it's even one penny short we'll come find you at the station. Someone will bring a briefcase of cash to you at the Ferris wheel. Go get it for me and wait at the east entrance. You have 1 5 minutes. lf you're late, your friend and the kids will die. By the way, don't forget: if you take off the cuffs, hundreds of people will die. Get out of the car. lnspector Sam. Are you two crazy? What are you doing? Don't you realize you're in deep shit? Hand over the money. What money? We got called here to catch crooks. They're holding about ten kids. The bombs will go off any moment. We're out of time. Police. Freeze! Freeze! Don't get too close. We've got a bomb! Tell everyone to get out. Calm down! You guys calm down. There's too many people here! Bomb! Get out! Move! Tell everyone to get out of here! Move! Chan Chun and Carson are holding Sam. How did this happen? Sam got news that the suspects would turn up at the Tamar. He went down with a team and next thing we knew, this happened. They're both cops. There are bad cops too. Yes, this is S.P. Cheung. How many injured officers at the scene? What's that? ls that a clock? l've never seen that before. lt makes weird sounds. Don't touch that! lt's a bomb. What the hell are you guys doing? You're cops. lf you keep this up, even the chief won't be able to save your ass. Wai King Ho and the kids are in their hands. We didn't have a choice, sir. You said Tien Yeng Seng is holding kids hostage and asked you to come get the money. Then what are you still investigating? After the robbery six months ago, the mastermind took the money. - Now the gang wants revenge. - Really? First they killed Tiger. Then they killed the truck's guard Ho Wing Keung. Who's the mastermind? We don't know yet, but he's a cop. The gang is looking for him. Okay, l believe you. Hurry up and give me the gun. l'll get someone to save Wai and the kids. Hurry up. What is the location? The bastards didn't come. Only two cops-- Carson Fong and Chan Chun. l told you, they didn't come. l told you already not to mess with those bastards. They're coming after you now. lt's okay, l know what to do. Why? No reason. As a cop... one wrong step and there's no turning back. Sorry. Okay, l believe you. Hurry up and give me the gun. l'll get someone to save Wai and the kids. He didn't need to hold a gun to help us. Officer Sam! Up there. After them! - What's it say on that thing? - 28 seconds. Let's go. Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Run faster. Where's my sister? My little sister is missing. What am l supposed to do? You guys race over there to see who's fastest. Hurry. What the hell? Still sleeping? Get up. - Hello. - Hey, this is Wai King Ho. Any news on those two? They ran into trouble at the fair. No news since. - Hey. - Hey, Lam Lam. Where are you? How are you? Don't worry about it. How's Ho? Ho called. He's coming back with the kids. The kids are all right. Lam Lam, take down this number: 9238-0906. Check out this number for me. See who it belongs to and where he is, understand? That's it. The current situation is very unpredictable. Hey, your phone. Hello. Sam's dead. l know who you are. Split your money with us, half and half. - Don't try anything funny. - We'll talk later. What's the matter? lnspector Cheung, lnspector Law, we found Sam's body at the fairgrounds. What? lssue a warrant for their arrest. Catch them no matter what. Yes, sir. Lam, did you find anything? Yeah, l got something. lt's here in the station. lt's S.P. Cheung. The call went out from his office line. That's it. lt's Cheung Man Yiu. There's an order to arrest you two. What's going on here? - Where is S.P. Cheung? - He's still in his office. Find out who else he contacted and let us know. - Hello. - Sir, the chief is here. - He's demanding to see you. - Where is he? He only said he wants you in the conference room. l'm on my way down. Why did you do it? Why did you kill Sam? Why? Did you take money? How much did the gang pay you? This is really disgraceful. You believe what you want. But lnspector Cheung and Sam, they were the ones involved in the robbery case. You two killed a chief inspector. Don't think you can make up stories and get away with it. - Permission to speak, sir. - Say it. That day, only S.P. Cheung knew the route of the armored truck. On top of that, no one else knew the gang would try to flee at Tai O Pier or reappear at the fairgrounds, sir. l don't have time to explain to you, sir. S.P. Cheung took their money and they're coming to the station to find him. Where? At the station? This is the station, you know. What do you think this is, a playground? All l'm saying is that their target is Cheung Man Yiu. Wherever Cheung is, they'll go, sir. Enough nonsense. You are now officially under arrest. You have the right to a lawyer. lf you have anything else to say, tell it to the judge. lnspector Law, someone wants to see you. She's from the intelligence unit. What's up? What do you want? lnspector Law, we've discovered something. Six months ago lnspector Cheung procured Wai King Tat's file. After that Wai disappeared. And then-- Are you telling me that Cheung is in it with the robbers? Yes. An hour ago Cheung already transferred all his money to a Canadian account. He also booked a flight to Canada tonight. lf you don't stop him now, it will be too late. Hey, quiet. Keep it down. Now go home and listen to your mommy and daddy, okay? Okay! Uncle is going to go catch the bad guys now. Be careful. Bye-bye. Michelle, do me a favor. Take these children home. So you had these kids. This is getting out of hand. l know, just go, please. Yeah, wait for me out front. Don't be late. Enough. Stop! l was wrong! But l wasn't going to betray you. l only told you to rob, but you killed a whole bunch of cops. What was l supposed to do? You were coming to kill me. l wasn't going to just sit around and wait. You left me no choice. Had it been you... you would've done the same. We're all in this for the money. Let's just split it. No use killing me. You can take my share and split it, all right? The cash is in the parking lot. l can take you there. What's up? l've found lnspector Cheung. They're going to the parking lot. Let's go. The money's right here. l didn't take a dime. l'm giving it back to you. Take it. Don't kill me. Take it, it's all there. The money's here. Take it all and let me go. Don't kill me. Cheung! You're trying to run away? Why are you involved with that gang? Why did you do it? Do you know how many people died for this? How are you going to make it up to your colleagues? How are you going to make it up to me? Were you that desperate for money? You could've asked me for money. Say something. You bastard. l'm done talking to you. Gasoline, run. Hurry up. lt's okay. l'm fine. Call all units. The suspects are disguised as cops. They've infiltrated the station, hurry! Go, go, go! Nobody move! Line up. Stop! Hold it. Upstairs. Sir, are you okay? Police! Freeze! Hey! Stop running! Retreat! lnspector Cheung. Area cordoned, sir. lt's too dangerous. They have heavy artillery, bombs, and hostages. Tell them to back off. - We can't do that, sir. - This is an order! Retreat! Go, go, go! Don't move. Shoot me. Shoot and avenge your brother. What are you waiting for? Your brother had a chance to kill me like this before. But he was too soft, so l killed him in the end. Shoot. Shoot me here. lt's where he got shot. l'm a robber. You have a right to kill me. No one will blame you. Then you would have paid tribute to your brother. Quick! Killing is such a thrill. ls it really? ls that the only way to survive? The world is not like that. l have no right to kill you. l'm a cop. You're under arrest. You're as stupid as your brother. My brother and l had a duty. lt was to catch you, not to kill you. Police! Don't move! You shot the wrong guy! You idiot! Why didn't you shoot me? Put down your weapons and come out! Your brother told me the same thing one time. But unfortunately... l'm different from you guys. l live in a world where the strongest survive. You either kill or get killed. l'm a bad guy. l can't change that. You wouldn't understand. But you already changed. That bomb in the bus didn't go off. lt shows you have a conscience. Why? Why are you brave enough to kill but not to change? Give it up. You can't escape. Put down your gun and come on out! l promise you l'll become a good person. But it will have to come in my next life. Wait! Wait! Put the gun down! Do you want me to kill you before l can take back the money? l want you to go down there and apologize to my girlfriend. lt's too bad you won't get your revenge. You're living in so much pain. l'd be doing you a favor by killing you. Hey! The money's over here! Brother. Cop. Wai King Ho! Arrest him! Arrest him! Arrest him! Arrest him! Let go. He's going to kill you. Arrest him! Wai King Ho. l'm sorry. l did all l could. lt's all right, you just lost some blood. Don't be scared. You'll be fine. l'm not scared. My brother told me l shouldn't be scared if l was doing the right thing. We know. You and your brother are both good cops. You did great. But don't try to force it. Take things easy, my friend. Sorry l looked at your photos without even asking. Be someone worthy of her love. We are police officers. Slow down. Be careful! See if there are still some wounded. - This way. - Here is one wounded. Can anyone come to help? We've been friends for 20 years. l didn't want it like this. But if you don't die, l won't be able to get away with this. l wouldn't be doing this if l had a choice. Put down your gun. - Sir, are you all right? - Let them go. Let them go! Shut up. Everyone shut up and listen to me. Let those two go. Let them go. They're with us. You hear me? Call the chief of police. l thought you were dead. l'm okay. Stop crying. Hush. l'm sorry. What are you doing tomorrow? Looking for work. Count me in. Let's go. Are you disrespecting me? Don't you know who l am? l play mahjong with your C.S.P. Wong every night. 320 HK dollars, that's nothing to me. How about l give you 640 HK dollars? Bet you're not this good at catching crooks. Look at you, you're a mess. Mister, if you keep this up, l can take you back to the station and charge you for insulting a police officer. Daddy, no. - Hello. - We're waiting for you, cousin. Yes, sir.
