Lord, let godliness and justice be the most beautiful jewels in my Emperor's crown. And forgive me if on this day of contemplation and prayer my Christian devotion is inseparable from the love that binds me forever to the dearest of your creatures. Byzantium, sordid and sumptuous, dazzling and mysterious, which united us in indestructible love. The circus games begin! On Sunday, will take place the Emperor's race. Rich against poor, Blues against Greens! Long live the Greens! Long live the people! Sunday, the winner will be proclaimed king for a day. If it's a Green, the people will triumph. It never happens! Yes. The horses of the Blues are well fed, but the Greens have faith in their charioteers! Their horses aren't fed! Bet on Andres, the leader of the guards! And for Arcal, the bravest charioteer? Our faith will make him win. Poor Arcal! He wears the colours of the people and the people are betting on Andres! Make way for Andres. Make way, make way! - An egg, please! - Who will pay? You're heartless! This child is dying of hunger. An egg for my son! Go away! Get away! What did he do? He offended Giovanni di Cappadocia. My eggs are expensive. I know. Condemned for not bowing to Giovanni di Cappadocia But who'll pay me? Do you want to go the same way? No, sir, I never said a word. Sunday the winner will be proclaimed king for a day. Follow me. You will know the outcome of the race. Justinian has some strange quirks. Indeed. What an idea to mingle with the plebs! I'll wear out my sandals. I'll ask the Emperor to buy another pair. Look at this beautiful vase! Why aren't you selling anything? Buy, that's all I ask. Everyone needs sandals. They're expensive. If they could afford them, they'd be eating too. Andres, you are strong! Affix your seal, it will bring you happiness. Andres bets! Who bets with him? His horses are quick, he will win! - You saw him? - I've searched everywhere without finding him. Open your eyes, fool! Long live Andres! - You are cowards! - Long live the Greens! My brothers, help me to search! I have a lantern, but my eyes are tired! And the oil is not what it used to be! Really? I came to Byzantium in search of a man from... - From Cappadocia? - Yes, from Cappadocia. I looked for him everywhere. That’s why I’m here. I walked, walked. Arriving at the sea at a kind of straight, I looked, then I asked someone if Byzantium was here. "Yes, it was here," he told me. "Then where is it?" "You see, it is no longer there, "a man from Cappadocia ate it. "The port, the houses, "the people, the streets, churches "and the imperial palace!" “What about the Emperor?” I say. “Which Emperor?” He said. "I didn't know there was one." "But do you know a warrior called Belisario? "That one was too difficult to swallow." Long live Belisario! No one will eat him! Not so loud! You could lose your head for a lot less. I keep mine in alcohol. Too acidic wine turns to vinegar. Vinegar is bad for your health. It must be thrown into the sea and purified. Don't doubt, the Blues are worried about the health of the Greens. And we will prove it by immediately emptying this barrel. Take him away. Bye, everyone and take care! Bye, everyone, my favourite followers! - Do you know him? - Hush, he's a Blue! My name is Theodora and you? How lovely you are. What times! We don't know who is who. I thought you were a patrician, I wanted to steal from you. Then I saw the guards looking for you and I understood that you had to answer to them. We are of the same race. I am a good girl. I steal out of necessity. To avenge myself. - From whom? - The Blues, of course! My father kept the circus bears. When he died, this post came back to me. To me and to my sister. But for the Blues, the Greens have no rights! That bastard, Giovanni di Cappadocia gave it to a Blue. You should have told the Emperor about it. Where are you from? It's not so easy to talk to him. Maybe more so than you think. I like you... Even if your blood is rather hot. Tell me... Are there beautiful women in your country? As beautiful as you, none in my country, nor Byzantium, nor any other country in the world. It's marvellous! I'll look at myself in the mirror. Come on, Arcal! Come on! How thin they are! Where is Arcal? Training on the track. All the Greens are with you! Stop! What are you up to? Nothing. Take me. What are you looking for in all that smoke? Smoke and ash say more about your sister than all the stars... What do you still want to know? Everything was easy for her. Everything she wanted, she got. But one day or another, she will have to pay! How you hate her! The most beautiful pottery of Mycenae! Look at these fabrics! These are Persian rugs! What colours! The most beautiful fruit of Byzantium. Picked fresh from the tree! Eggs, fresh eggs. What vegetables! Still covered with dew. Still in love? You'll see what I'll do to him! Stop him, Egina! No, Saidia, let go of me! Stealing a Blue is good, but getting caught is a disgrace! Theodora! The guards! They're looking for you! The most beautiful fabrics, the most precious cloth... Coming from Crete. So buy them! Decorated with this fabric, the smallest slum becomes a palace. Pottery from Samos! Persian carpets! Cretan fabrics! - Where shall we hide her? - Among the lions! Good idea, thank you, sister! Come out of there! Why not come get me! This is what we'll do! Be careful, the lions bite! - Arrest that woman! - What are you waiting for? - Are you deaf? - Deaf, but not crazy! Come with me. - Me? - Yes, you. Let's go. No! Let go of me! I don't want to! Take your hands off me! Don't touch me! Put that thief in jail. In competition it is allowed. But here it's a crime. My God, what shame! What cowards, these Greens! It is a great honour for this tribunal that the Emperor, loved and guided, inspired by God, comes to attend in person the first hearing of the year. The first accused! Who are you? I am Scarpios' lawyer. As well as the lawyer of all the accused. I am Scarpios, son of Niketas, free man. Until now, I was free as a gazelle. And here I am a little dizzy without knowing why. Scarpios, in a harbour tavern, entertained the customers with infamous remarks against Giovanni di Cappadocia, our most respectable minister. And even against our Emperor! His offence is very serious without extenuating circumstances. Witnesses? No need, I caught him in the act. Besides, he has already confessed. Confess? Let me tell you. If I had been whipped any longer I would have confessed to having organized the revolt of Vercingétorix, the assassination of Caligula, the misdeeds of the sea serpents and the diarrhoea of the newborn. Mercy! Don't listen to him, he's crazy. I knew him as a child! He always had this mania, I raised him! I beg you! I beseech you, acquit him! For the crimes committed, Scarpios is condemned to two years in prison and a week in the pillory. It's severe for a mountebank! Thank you! I thank the court for its leniency. And my lawyer for his eloquence. Take him away! The next accused! I promised you a surprise, here it is! I am Theodora, adopted daughter of Egina, the tamer of wild animals. This woman was caught stealing a gold necklace from a patrician in the marketplace. She was arrested by the head of the guards. Do you have a lawyer? I have no lawyer. I am innocent. The necklace which is the cause of this lawsuit was offered to me spontaneously by a young patrician. In exchange for...? Nothing! Not even a kiss. What generosity! A true lord! A good man, maybe a patrician, or a magistrate. Her discretion deserves a necklace! She's a demon! Enough! These details do not interest the court. Silence! You will be punished for the theft of the jewel. You drive men to sin! You are all courtesans, pagans and depraved! I'm not a courtesan! He got nothing from me. Punish her in accordance with the law. According to justice, we decree that Theodora, adopted daughter of Egina, the wild animal tamer, will be pilloried and have her right hand severed. Rather, cut off my head! Death would be better! Her gaze devoured me with fire! I've tried to escape, to resist that cursed creature! But I follow her like a dog! Do you still think of her? Every moment, night and day. What will you do if you see her? - I'll want her with all... - Aren't you ashamed? I need her. She's bewitched me. I tried to break free to stifle my desire. But it's stronger than me. I unjustly condemned her. This passion tears me apart with remorse and the cowardice of my act terrifies me. What do you want from me? The forgiveness of the Church? I have faith in divine mercy. God, making you Emperor, made you the living symbol of his doctrine. And this sacred investiture you defile with the filth of injustice and lust. I repent, father! Your passion is too strong. I demand absolution! I won't absolve you... at least until that day in which you show sincere repentance! God is not satisfied with words! Chase that woman from your heart, reject her from your thoughts. And if you meet her, push her away firmly! Only then can I absolve you. Let me go! I am innocent, let go of me! Arcal! Egina! Help! Help! Don't cry. Do not despair, my beauty. No cage can hold a panther like you. Don't hurt me. I have fragile ankles. By order of the Emperor, the racecourse and the adjacent streets must remain clear. Following the tradition, the Blues and the Greens can access the right and left stands. But no-one is allowed to occupy the great palace steps which lead to the racecourse. It is guarded by the Emperor's Praetorians! Look, Justinian! Look how the Greens bow their heads! Their athletes are in good shape! They can only win when supported by their friends. Forget this woman! She's not worth it. Look at Andres! What skill! All have their own chariot, yours is to govern. To measure my physical strength would help me conquer my anxieties. Are you dying to drive a quadriga? It's true! But the people? The people? They love strength and skill. And would be proud to have an athletic Emperor. Give your quadriga to the Emperor. I am Arcal. I drive the Greens' quadriga. What do you want? The winner is entitled to what he wants. I ask for the pardon of my fiancee Theodora. - Are you so sure to win? - For her, I'd do miracles. He is right. I have committed a terrible crime. And lost a delicious woman. What an honour! Where is Theodora? Yes, the dancer! Be indulgent! Theodora the prisoner is no longer... What? You killed her, you will answer for it! No, she's not dead! She escaped with the help of the guards. The branding irons! Justinian, have mercy! - I am innocent! - Mercy! Mercy! At dawn this morning, this man, seduced by gold, let her run away. Let the light disappear from his corrupt gaze. This man will now be the executioner of those who fail in their duty. Gone is the gazelle. The gazelle has fled. We won't hang around anymore! We won't hang around anymore! Gone is the gazelle. You! Me. Does that sound strange? I was waiting for you. I was frightened on my own. Frightened, you? How did you escape? My pretty legs are also made for running. And the guard loved my gold bracelets. I was going to win to obtain your pardon. I was so afraid of losing! Let's go, it's dangerous here. - Don't be afraid. - Let's go to Asia! It's too far. Nothing is too far away. - I won't go! - You're crazy. Justinian will take you back. - Why not. - You're kidding? You risk your head. - Don't believe it. - Madness! I won't allow this suicide. This time, I'll know how to defend myself. You still have the mark of the chains. A memory of Justinian. - It didn't cost you much. - Oh, yes! I too have been marked with a hot iron! This time he won. It's my turn next! You don't know what you're saying anymore. Keep your pity, charioteer! I'm worth as much as you! It is not enough to be handsome and strong. I understand everything! Ah, yes? You have a lover! - Did you discover that by yourself? - So it's true! The one who freed you? An officer? Andres? That dandy! I'd have preferred the torture. I'm thirsty for wine! What now? Nothing, I thought I heard horses. I would pay dear to know what goes on inside your head. Drink and you will find out. It's good! Real Samos wine! It's strange. I feel quite dizzy. It's tiredness. I suddenly feel sleepy. Sleep! Sleep, I ask for nothing better. Theodora, you've poisoned me. No, you fool! I love you too much for that. Sleep, I will dream for you! It's madness to let Justinian race. He is young and deft. Do you think it is worthy of a sovereign to mingle with these charioteers and mountebanks? He had illustrious predecessors! Nero, for example. Nero, he's a fine example. Because he lacked an advisor like me... a true patriarch. The representative of the people is in no rush to be beaten by you! And to think that the charioteer was sure to win. The signal! Release the horses! Andres. what are you waiting for? I gave up my place. What about our bets, then? Rest assured, my quadriga is in good hands. The best in Byzantium. But it's the Emperor! Yes. What a triumph for Justinian. It is a very fleeting glory. Fortunately. - Who's replaces Arcal? - I don't know. Where did he go? But it's a woman! So it seems! It's Theodora! She's almost my daughter! Bravo! It's the penultimate lap! You shouldn't have, Theodora. Why did you humiliate me in front of all Byzantium? Did you think they only trust in you? Do you doubt it? You pain me just to sit for one evening at the Emperor's table! You will always be so dear to me! You drive me crazy! Don't think I'll let you, the Emperor can damn well wait. Let go of me! Free her from this fanatic. Let me go! Damn whore! Let me go! I come on behalf of the Emperor to invite you to dinner. You probably want to make yourself beautiful. Come to my palace. You will find what it takes to be princess... for an evening! Yes, Sire. Call me Giovanni, for tonight. The days go by and are not all alike. Give me the mirror. Help me out. How your eyes shine! It's makeup, Giovanni. Pick up this comb. Put it there. You were born to command. I felt we would be friends. It was I who took Justinian to the tribunal. I won't thank you. His behaviour surprised me. Me too, I assure you. Take the dress out of the ivory chest. I hope it will be worthy of your beauty. - I like you. - Don't touch me! - You refuse my support? - I have your master's. Will it be enough for you tomorrow? Who knows? Beware, my power is great. Perhaps not more than my weakness. You're not only beautiful but intelligent too! Time will tell. Golden sandals? I prefer them red. Only the Empress can wear them. Am I not queen? Of beauty! The prefect and the dancer Theodora! A Green among the patricians. She won't stay here long, I think. Here is our queen! Continue! Take one. Does this food not please you? Yes, but I don't want to end up like her She looks like a whale. Hush, she's the Emperor's cousin! Let her say so, she's right. Stay as you are, Theodora. Keep your sincerity. It is worthy of your marvellous beauty. These oriental women are truly astounding. Indeed. We are defeated in advance... on the track, in the street... And at the palace! Who are these pearls for? For my guests. Give them to the artists, not to the courtesans. Fine. They are so greedy. They are ready to kill for a pearl. We have taken this man trying to break into the palace through the underground tunnels. I know him! It was he who begged me to pardon you. The beauty of this woman is dangerous. It does not justify the actions of this man. Let him be punished like those who violate the threshold of this palace. Take him away! What will his sentence be? Death. But it was me he wanted to kill, not you! There's no other punishment. Your life is worth mine, even though I am Emperor. Let go of me! Why? Do you love him so much? I want his life. I'll give you that man's life. Do you only love him like a brother? As long as his sentence lasts at the Anatolian salt pans there'll be no misunderstanding. Let go of me! What now? Stop treating me like a courtesan. I'm not a Christian but I know enough of your religion... - to know... - Know what? That we can only be united in marriage. She was the one who taught me that night that to bow one's head is not a sign of defeat. I didn't want to believe that by proclaiming my love before God and men, I gave in to a woman's intransigence. But I won a great victory: the love of my people. Open the doors to General Belisario! Long live Belisario! Long live the conqueror of the Persians! The honours given to me here in Byzantium on return from the Persian expedition, exceed my merits. I did only my duty, just as my soldiers. Sadly, many have fallen. And our army no longer has numerical superiority which alone... imposed on the barbarians the respect for our borders and for peace. My men can no longer fight. Byzantium needs new forces. You are right, Belisario, but our coffers are empty. Mercenaries are expensive. Those who will defend the homeland could be paid by something else than our currency. What do you mean? Which currency? Something that never came out of the vaults. Freedom! Freedom? What freedom? Free the slaves and they will fight the barbarians. They will surely risk their lives at this price. Love for Byzantium as well as for our subjects inspired the Empress with this act of clemency. The noble representatives of the Blues will no doubt be happy to demonstrate that the interests of the Fatherland prevail over those of the patricians. My wife's proposal will be implemented as soon as possible. This provision will count among those that Theodora's kindness and charity has suggested to me. First, the general amnesty and the new code of justice. Do not forget that kindness and charity are not synonyms of weakness. The enemies of Christ... Do you see, I am not loved by everyone. Only the wicked are against you. They are many and powerful. I know it. I well know those who finance border rebellions to simply block an army capable of hindering traitors. I thought I had put Giovanni and his kind out of harm's way. But they are raising their heads. They will dare... but they will fail. I would like to be sure! I've prepared a nasty shock for them. Seeing the barbarians are at present kept quiet, I will therefore set up my camp on the other side of the Bosphorus. A signal from you... and I will come with my men. What signal? A large cloud of smoke that we can see from afar. While our generals and armies are fighting to protect our borders and defend from barbarian invasions, we must remain united. Therefore during the feasts for their victory dissent must not appear nor the diversity of ideas and religions. It is necessary that around the Empress and myself a block of love forms, of devotion and faith. A day must come when the Blues and Greens, unite towards a single goal, invoking peace and freedom of thought. The union of eastern and western empires. On that day, our troops will embark for Africa, for Italy and Byzantium will finally be the heiress of Rome. This ambitious project seems unachievable, but remember that a people is capable of anything if it lives in love and banishes slavery. I am glad that this proof of my wife's wisdom, your Empress, manifests itself on the day we celebrate the fifth anniversary of the happy advent of our nuptials. Didn't you like my speech? You inspired me, as you have inspired me for 5 years. Why do you say that? I watched you, you were looking elsewhere. Yet this speech, more than any other, proves our mutual faith. If a thought torments you, you should entrust it to me alone. Do you hide anything from me? Oh no, I have no secrets from you! But my happiness is so great. I'm afraid I don't deserve it. Today, an unusual sadness oppresses me. As if our love was in danger only too soon. Sad thoughts for such a beautiful day! You are my whole life, Justinian. Now I can confess that at the beginning only ambition guided me towards you. How strange! If you acted out of ambition, I only acted out of passion. You were just a beautiful creature. I didn't think I would share my life with you. Do you remember? I laughed here on this terrace, then it became a miracle. Day after day you revealed yourself and caprice has given way to infinite tenderness. I began to get to know you. I wanted only the honours but also the responsibilities of power. Now I love you madly! And one day I had no longer any ambition or desire apart from being more worthy of you every day. The situation is serious! The Empress has betrayed us. She has denied our sacred rights. Death! No! None of us... None of us should raise a hand to that woman. To that gypsy! She will be more harmful dead than alive. Theodora victim of the Blues, of the patricians! What a symbol! My friends! I have decided that it will be one of her own, a Green who will kill her! Our hatred for Theodora is great, but nothing compared to the feeling that for five years in the Anatolian mines has matured day by day in the soul of a man that each one of you know. This man, at present in the capital, has only one desire to break into the palace and revenge himself! It would be charitable to open the doors to him. Let him come. Arcal! What a pleasure to see you again. - Beware! - You've not changed a bit. And yet hatred has transformed me. You will pay for my suffering five long years! You don't scare me. I know you too well. Come on, strike here! I cannot. You see, you are weak. Quiet! You, did you really want to kill me? Theodora, What has taken you so far from me? It had to be, Arcal! I was born for this destiny. Ah yes? Were you born to live in luxury? Yes, I know how to appreciate fabrics, perfume, jewels. Did you sell yourself for that? Is it so hard to understand? I brought Justinian something precious. What? The soul of the people. No more searching for truth in the streets. It's here by his side, at every moment and her name is Theodora. All your hopes are there and those of Egina, Scarpios, all the Greens and those of Byzantium. I understand everything! We all have a destiny. Mine was to help the people with God's help. Forgive me! What an idiot! I was going to help the Blues. - What? - It's Andres, the head guard who let me into the palace, yesterday I attended one of their meetings with Giovanni di Cappadocia. Are you sure? I'm certain. Defend yourself! It's clear they want your life. These hyenas don't know me. I was waiting for this moment. I will crush them! What strength! He must really love you! I love him too! No Arcal, be brave. We two are so different! Like heaven and earth and I love you too. But with another love. No, don't tempt me! A little weakness and our enemies will crush us! You love me like a brother. That's how it is! Go, it's almost dawn! Guards! Arrest that man! Catch him, kill him! No! He is innocent! Don't kill him. - Don't touch me. you disgust me! - Listen to me, I beg you! Arcal came to tell me that the Blues are preparing a rebellion. I don't believe you! That's right, Justinian! The Blues want my life, yours. Believe me. You lie! I'm sure! You don't look happy, Saidia! What are you thinking? I would like a white silk dress and a ruby necklace. Think about more serious things. Should I go naked? It would be a beautiful spectacle. And also much less inexpensive! You are as vicious as you are stingy. We're made for each other. In four months I have understood that you are neither generous nor virtuous. A women's virtue comes at a price! If you neglect me I'll have to find another! You are no clairvoyant, Saidia. In a few hours, you will be the happiest woman in the empire. Excuse me, Sire! What is it? Senator Smirnos is asking for you. Well? The plan failed. Arcal did not have - the courage to kill her. - Is he arrested? He escaped the guards. He spoke? I do not know. One way or another they'll learn the truth. It's a matter of hours. We must take the initiative. The signal, quickly, or it will be too late! - What's happened? - Nothing. Would you like to have 10,000 sesterces in gold coins? You must earn them. What must I do? Nothing too difficult. Only lie. You do it so admirably. I've told you the truth! How can I convince you? Nothing can make me forget this man in your arms. I swear to you. You are my everything. Stop this comedy, gypsy! How foolish I've been to believe in your love. How stupid I am. You are driven only by your ambition. Insult me, but defend yourself from Giovanni! It's only you I need to defend myself from! From now on, I shall never believe a word you say! Speak, quickly! Forgive me. The Blues are invading the palace. They are led by Giovanni di Cappadocia. Him! Traitor! Damn him! We are ready to die to save you! Thank you, your life is your most precious gift and without knowing, you give me something even more precious! Go now! The situation is serious but I'm not downhearted. If I have to pay with my life for the certainty of your fidelity, death will seem sweet to me! Theodora! Forgive me. I love you. You won't flee Byzantium? I am not Emperor to flee like a slave. I am so proud of you. He who reigns prefers death to exile. May the purple be my shroud! But nothing is lost, Belisario is ready. We must act, stay there. I will save not our lives but our dignity. Believe in me! What are your orders? I give no orders to the Emperor. If I still am, I'll arrest you for conspiracy. What conspiracy? We are loyal subjects. We have taken power on your behalf. To save you from infamy... In what are you meddling? In our interests, that of the empire! Look, Justinian. - All the leaders are here. - Yes! All the privileged. Those whom I have showered with favours! Renegades dressed in ermine. Official perjurers! False judges covered in gold. Andres, the oldest senator. The master of ceremonies. The great Judge! Indeed, they are all here! You talk like a fool, not like a king. They are the words of a rabble rouser suggested by one at your side. - You mean the Empress? - You cannot deny your caste and prefer the rabble. - Justinian, She has enslaved you. - We are one. You have nothing in common with her! She has ridiculed you, Justinian! Betrayed you! - Shamefully! - The proof! Give me the proof! Speak. The Greens are at the racetrack, led by Arcal. Arcal! Whom the Empress will join. We came to warn you of this disgrace. We came to save your life. And this is how you react. Proof, I demand proof! Nothing easier. Leave me! Don't touch me! Now is the time to tell the whole truth, Saidia. No, don't force me, I beg you! Swear to forget your blood ties and speak the truth. I swear! As a little girl, I already loved Arcal. He loved me too. He swore to be mine forever. Theodora,, jealous, stole him from me. In vain I begged her. She wouldn't listen to me, enslaved by her passion. Then Arcal was arrested, condemned. Theodora has become Empress. For years, I hoped that on his return he would return to me. But she took him back! They saw each other here in the palace. My sister the Empress committed this terrible sin... She desecrated the imperial house. In the grip of her senses, blind to her duties, she betrayed her husband at my place, first in secret then in the open, without shame. I could do nothing to prevent this disgrace. As if this is not enough for her, she wants to kill the Emperor and put Arcal on the throne. - Well? - Silence! Silence, silence! I'm from Propontis, Niclas was arrested. Martial law was declared in Sabiros. At the port, we've enlisted the dockers to form an assault militia. The Blues have the support of the Emperor! Yes, the Emperor has abandoned us! The Empress has betrayed her people. Death! It was dangerous, she had to give in. She won't get away with it. The Blues want her head. My friends! Giovanni di Cappadocia has taken power. He detains the Emperor. And the better to suffocate the people, he tried to destroy the power of your protectors, Justinian and I. I managed to escape from the palace. The people refuse to be reduced to slavery. Belisario's army is on the other side of the Bosphorus. We agreed upon a signal: a great cloud of smoke coming from the Circus. He will come immediately to our aid. Long live Belisario! The Blues will crush us in the arena. Quick, to the tunnels! And let us fight for our lives while we await Belisario. Light the pyre! You were right. Forget the offences I have done! Help me put down the revolt. As for Theodora, I will find her! I will search the city, the empire, village by village to the ends of the earth. To the stables, hurry. We will crush them with our horses! Come! Look! The other side of the Bosphorus. Smoke! Gather the army, there is no time to lose. Let's help Arcal with our quadrigas. Stay here! No, I'll come with you to finish it. - How? - You'll see. - Free the big cats. - Hurry! They are in the tunnels. Kill them all! They've killed Arcal! Enough, stop! Lower your arms, enough bloodshed! Enough! Arcal! Farewell, Theodora. Do not cry. It is pointless. You said it... I am but a poor charioteer! All muscles and without... a brain. My brother! Your loyalty has saved Byzantium. And my love. Whore! Here is your wife. They killed Arcal, Justinian! They are savages! Shut your mouth! She is yours. Belisario is coming! Long live Belisario! Belisario's army? - What are you doing here? - I'm saving your throne. - Who sent you? - The Empress. We knew the traitors were conspiring against you. I waited for her signal to come and defend your throne. No, it's not true! Say it's not true! Let go of me. Theodora and Arcal's betrayal, Is that a lie? Answer! Yes, it's a lie. I hate you, Justinian, I always have! Life gave you everything: beauty, love, glory! And I, Giovanni di Cappadocia, I had everything to be Emperor: intelligence, genius! I have lived in your shadow, like a slave. I hate you! Guards! Chain him up! Let me go! A lance. Long live Theodora! Long live the Emperor! Doubting her for the first time in my life, I doubted you, Lord! Separated from her, I lost the support of a strong and just sovereign: charity. It is charity that I implore from you, that the evening of my life may be comforted by your kindness, by the love of my wife and my Empress and the devotion of our subjects. Subtitles: corvusalbus
