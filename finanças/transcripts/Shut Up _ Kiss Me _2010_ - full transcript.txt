And I'm looking to go on a date. Okay, why don't you tell the Guy-5 viewers a little about yourself? Your stats, like your height, weight, you know. I'm 5'9", and I weigh 190 pounds. I have brown hair and Blue eyes. I'm seven inches circumcised. Cut. Oh, I'm seven inches cut. No, cut the tape. [whispers] Cut the tape. We don't tell penis size. Oh, you said tell statistics, so... No, no, honey, penis size is a very personal thing that should be explored one on one. Okay? Okay, gotcha. Okay, yeah. One on one. Now let's settle Ah, let's breathe into the taint, out the balls. Okay, let's relax and smile. Go. Should I do it from the beginning or just... Just continue, honey, because I'm gonna have to cut the shit out of this later. Um... I'm an Aries. I don't know what that means, but I like Thai food, comic books, and I'm originally from New Jersey, the good part, of course, and I own a fitness company with my best friend Vinnie. Vinnie's straight, but he's the closest thing to a brother that I have. We have so much in common, actually. We're both from back east. Brooklyn all day, baby. We both like action films. He likes car chases. I like Jason Statham. Uh, we both like chick flicks and Lisa Loeb. What the fuck? No, no we don't. Whoa. Would you... you cut with the F-bombs, okay? Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah, you should be sorry. All right, now, let's go. Come on, Ben. This is my best friend, Vinnie, and we own a business together. What's poppin'? Ben's a good guy, so go on a date with him. Okay, these are my friends James and Sara. [whispering] James and Sara. Oh... You guys should pick Ben. He'll be like this all night long. Oh, and he's huge. Too bad he's a bottom. [mouthing] Thank you, James and Sara. [mutters] It's not true. [chuckles] And this is Callie and Brad. They just got married. Yay, married. And they want to say a few nice words on my behalf. Oh, yeah. Hello, everyone. Ben is such a doll. I love you, Ben. Thank you. You're my gay boyfriend. [whispers] Thanks. Thanks. Ben's a commitment-phobe. Cut, cut, okay. Whoa... hello? You guys are trying to make him look like a catch, so let's not talk about his commitment phobia, his obvious lack of personality, or the fact that he uses steroids, okay? And F-Y-I, sweetheart, tops are much more in demand. I don't do steroids, and I'm not a bottom. [laughing] I'm sure you don't, dear, and I'm sure you aren't. And you need to stop telling people I'm a commitment-phobe when it's not true. But, it is true. It's not true. Yes, it is. Callie, tell them its not true. Ha! Dude, let's be honest, Ben. You can't even commit to keeping your furniture in the same spot. That's ridiculous. Uh, no, not in the slightest, actually, because every time we come to your apartment, the furniture's been moved. You rearranged it. Yeah, its nice. This is feng shui. Oh, yeah. Oh, you rearranged it again. It's nice. Yeah, this is for ergonomic reasons. Ah. [clucks tongue] Are you kidding me? Now, this is nice. Yeah, I saw this on HGTV. Okay, that probably wasn't the best example. Aw, honey. Okay, these are really cute tidbits of information, and I want to put rusty forks in my eyes, so why don't we just, you know... I've got deadlines, and I have to make six other tapes here, so we don't we just skip your friends, and you could just tell us who you are, where you're from, and what you like, okay, Ben? Oh, oh, but I wanted... Girl, you are so done. Thank you. Okay, yeah. And you, please, just go. Let's get a step on it. Whoo! 'Cause I've got a camel toe and a yeast infection. I gotta get out of here, 'kay? Hi, my name is Ben. I'm 35. I'm originally from New Jersey. I'm single. I like camping. I'm more of a dog person, enjoy comic books. I'm looking for another guy like myself, and if any of sounds appealing to you, please respond to my ad. Thank you. All right. See, that is something I can work with. Thank you. You have any Monistat around? [Callie] What is going on with you? What ever happened with that video dating thing you were doing? No, I cancelled that so fast. I mean, I guess I met some interesting guys from there, but mostly just losers. Let's see. Oh, when you left, remember I was dating Roy? Roy? Yeah, you remember... My build, the brown hair, the website designer. Oh, Roy, yeah. So we're dating for about a month, and then he had to go on this business trip to Thailand, so the whole time he's there, he's calling me, sending me e-mails, postcards, telling me how much he misses me. "Benny, I can't wait to come back home." So he comes back to the States, and then... I got to tell you... While I was in Thailand, I realized that Thai men, they're so much deeper and more spiritual then white men. So I can't date you anymore. You can't? Well, you're white... and shallow. But I really really want us to be friends. [Ben] There was Shane. Flex your biceps for me? Can I what? Flex for me, baby. [panting] Seriously? Yeah, it'll really turn me on. I... yeah I guess. Oh, man... that's so hot. Oh, my God. Oh. Oh! Oh, my God. [moaning] [panting] Are you fucking kidding me? No, that was so hot. I just shot my load. You didn't even touch yourself. I know, right? I'm really into muscle worship. Yeah, that's great for you, but what about me? Oh, well... you can still fuck me. Um, I don't think I have any lube, though. Hold on a second. I couldn't find any lube, but I found some shampoo that I rubbed in my ass. I think it'll be totally fine. Um, I don't think so. Oh. Oh. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, the shampoo Oh, my god. Oh, my God. Fuck, that burns. [water running] [sighs] Hello? [Ben] Then there was Tom. We were dating for a few weeks, and he told me... I haven't had sex since my ex boyfriend ran out on me eight months ago. I'm sorry. But I'm negative. Here's my paperwork. Um, I'm negative, too. Do you always carry this around with you? I don't mean to be forward, but since we're both negative and I haven't had sex in eight months, could we have sex right now? Tom, if you haven't had sex in eight months, why the hell is there a used condom on the floor? That's from eight months ago. Yeah, eight months. Did you touch it? It's dry as a bone. Go on, touch it. Hold on to it. [chuckles] I'm not gonna play CSI with your used condom. You know what? I bet I know what happened. I bet Butch brought it in from outside, didn't you? Bad dog! You think your dog dragged that in? Wait. [laughs] I lied. I had sex a week ago. Tom, I was here a week ago. Okay... two days ago. I was here last night. Okay, two hours ago. Can you please forgive me? Oh, sick. Wait, what are you talking about? Condom? I don't see any condom. Good dog, Butchie Wutchie. Can we have sex now? Oh my God, the dog ate the condom? Oh, that is so fucking gross. I know, it's nasty, right? Wow, those are some bad dates. No wonder you quit the service. Well, Sara and James are gonna come over later. They're going to help me place this... I don't know... Internet ad thing. Really? Well that'll be fun. And, you know, I was thinking. If that doesn't work out, I can always set you up with my hairstylist Todd. Uh, let me think about that. Hell no. Why not? He's nice, has a good job. He's a flamer, and he's a big girl. Haven't we talked about your internalized homophobia? Internalized homophobia. Log Cabin Republicans. Listen, I'm comfortable with it. I just don't wanna sleep with it. Just... You have to tell me how this whole Internet dating thing goes. Well, you know I will. And, I mean, James uses it and it seems to work for him, so... Okay, Benny, you know I want the best for you, but you also have to remember that James is a slut that tells everyone he's bi. Bi, Bisexual, put that you're a Bi. Dom alpha male. Hung big and thick. Ooh, yeah, thick. Beer-can thick. Seven inches. Ew, eight. Well, Internet inches. Likes it rough. Wants to hit it from the B side. Bubble butt. Round and juicy. Oh, total dom top. Hey, James, this is a dating ad. It's not some nasty sex thing. Ew, Sara said it, too. Guys, I'm placing this ad for a date, so I'm not listing beer can, big and juicy, thick and bubble whatever else it was. Okay, okay, what about being a Bi? [Ben] No. Oh, God, you're never going to get laid. Here, just let me type it for you. No, absolutely not. Hey James, can you type this? Is this doing it for you? Whoo. Whoo. You both really need some therapy. Are you straight yet? You spazzin' out, man. You placed a personal ad online? What's wrong with that? A lot of people use the Internet to date. Yeah, lots of losers. No, not losers. People who are just too busy or can't go to the bars. Yeah, because they're defective, i.e. losers. You know what? Sara and James helped me place that ad, and you know what? I'm not defective, and I'm definitely not a loser. Opinions vary. And why are you listening to those two? It sounds like someone's jealous because I have friends and, frankly, you don't. Yes, I am jealous of that. Be nice, okay? Those guys are my friends. All right. You know, I'm actually planning on meeting some of these guys from my ad this weekend. Have fun, man. What? They sounded nice. On the phone? Ben, you placed the ad, like, an hour ago. No, via e-mail. This Internet dating, it's really fast. Look, there's two requirements for the broads I meet. One... they must want to suck my dick, and two... They need to go ass to mouth. Swallowing is optional. Wow, that is a charming checklist. Hey, don't judge me. I get laid. You jerk off. 'Nuff said. Hey, are you Ben? Yeah, are you Joseph? Yeah, but everyone calls me Jojo. Jojo. You are so cute. Okay, Jojo? How old are you? Twenty-six. Twenty-two? Seventeen. Here's the chicken... and the steak. Mm. Nothing like rare meat. Nope. So, you wanna play head to head? Excuse me? On PS3. What's your user ID? I don't even know what that is. Oh, come on. My mom said you could come over after our date if you wanna play. Your mom. Well, yeah. I mean I live in the basement. She's not even gonna bother us unless she's doing my laundry. Um, in your photo you... You looked a little bit different. This is the real me, though. I hope you don't mind. I'm pre-op, will have the surgery soon. Oh, I think that's great for you. I do, but that's just not really my thing. [laughs] Oh, thank God. You're not my type either, sweetie. Dessert? No. Pre-op. Post-op. Hi. Woof. What? Woof. Woof? Oh, I know, who says that, right? I'm over Internet dating. You fool me once. Seriously, can't you go to a bar and get laid like a normal gay? Oh, a normal gay? This isn't about sex. James, you meet a lot of guys online. How come this never happens to you? Let me set you up. No. At least you'd be getting laid if you let James here set you up. Thank you. Oh, yeah, I'd be getting laid. No offense, James, but you've seen his version of acceptable men. It's back hair and bad breath. You'll take anything connected to a cock. Steam room cruiser, schlobbing the knob. [howls] Listen. A cock is a cock. I am not marrying these guys. We're just getting off together. That's it. I can't do that. I need some sort of mental connection. You are such a girl. Sara, can you jump in and help me out here? Sorry, buddy. Sex isn't that taboo with me either. I mean, if they want anal, it's gotta be love, but I don't mind jerking a guy off and I don't have hang-ups like you. I don't have hang-ups. [typing] Single male. Bisexual with girlfriend out of town. I cannot put that I'm bisexual. This is ridiculous. [cell phone rings] Hello. [Callie] I just met the cutest guy for you. I was at Trader Joe's. I'm walking down the aisle... No. I didn't finish. No. Why not? Callie, your set ups are always nightmares. No, they aren't. You're crazy, and you're way too picky. Oh, really? How about you remember when you set me up with Lupe the choreographer? He was hot. Callie, you have this idea that just because we're both gay, we're gonna get along. And then there was that other guy, what was his name, the agent? John, he was cute, and he was built. Built? Those were man boobs, not pecs, and cute is for bunny rabbits, not men. Oh, and what about Massimo? That dude was straight. Not from what I hear. Oh, that's my call waiting. I gotta go. It's my mom. I love you. I love you, too. Bye. [doorbell rings] Hi. You look cuter than your picture. Excuse me? From online, dude. It's me, Horsehung78. Guess what? I'm not wearing underwear. What the hell are you talking about? Oh, don't be shy. You weren't in the chat room, Mr. "I wanna eat your ass all day long." I have not been in a chat room. Look, my girlfriend's waiting for me. She's expecting me home in an hour, and from the looks of it, you're packing eight inches, just like you said. Let me in, and I'll blow you. Listen, I think there's been a mistake. Is your name Ben? Yeah. Then there's "Ben" no mistake. This is really awkward. Come on. What do you want? You want a hand job? You want a blow job, rim job? You can blow me, too. It's okay. Oh, look, everybody says they have a girlfriend. It's all right. Now, normally I work as a hooker, but you're such a hottie, I just wanna do you for free. A hooker. Yeah. Let's get off. Listen, I have to go, okay? No, you listen. I drove all this way. Now, let me in, we'll get off, and then I'll go. No, I don't think so. I'm sorry, I have to go. Just grab my cock, and then you'll change your mind. No. Fuck! [sighs] James, what the fuck? [James] What? You know what. Oh, come on. You didn't think he was hot? No, and that's not even the point. I'm not trying to hook up for random sex. And what are you doing going into chat rooms using my picture? Um, you should be thanking me, Its not like I kept him for myself. Look, he was the hottest one in there, and I did it for you, boo. I'm a true friend. Listen, no more surprises at my door. Uh-huh. Okay. No, I'm serious. No more. Listen, I'm pissed off. I'm just gonna go. Go where? I'm a busy guy. I've got stuff to do. I've gotta water my plants, and run errands. Okay, lesbian. Oh, but hey, do you mind if I call Horsehung78? I hate to see a good thing go to waste. No, you can have him. Goodbye. Bye. [Ben] I saw the hottest Cro-Mag run by my house today. Oh, yeah? Did you say anything to him? No, he just ran by. I chickened out. I couldn't just yell, "Hey." Why not? Because you know that's not my style. Okay, what the fuck is going on with your neck? What? Your neck, dude. You got a hickey. What? Oh, fucking Amber, dude. I'm so pissed, she clamped onto me like a vacuum. I couldn't get her off. You couldn't get her off? She's five foot. She weighs, what, 85 pounds? I'm telling you, bro. She had me in this position. And then she goes up to me and she says... [laughing] Now everyone will know that you have a girlfriend. Oh, a girlfriend? What are you talkin' about, a girlfriend? You are marked now, and you are mine. Get the fuck outta here. [laughing] [squeals] [laughing] You wanna play? All right, that's it. That's it. [laughing] Oh, she's your girlfriend now? Yeah, I guess so, but she's fuckin' crazy. Oh, well I think it's sweet that you've been branded. All right, enough, enough. What are you doing tonight? Callie's gonna come over. You wanna stop by. No, I'm watching a movie with Amber. I'm sorry, but you're pussy whipped. She's got you in the cobra clutch. Listen, bro, if I can see one of these chick flicks with her, and I actually pretend to like it, she lets me fuck her in the ass. Oh, you are a gentleman, aren't you? Yeah, in the ass. [water whooshes] [Six Million Dollar Man sound effect] [Callie] You know, you are stalking him from your own front lawn. You know that, right? I know. You rearranged your furniture again. I know. Okay, you just have to say hello next time. I know. You should move it back to the way it was. This looks terrible. I know. What is... Are you in another world? Can I tell you guys how cute he is? Did I tell you? Aw. He's so cute. I can't get him out of my brain. Jesus, stop being such a pussy and go say hi to him. You obviously know exactly when he runs by your house every day. Yeah. Creepy. I know. Oh, Mr. Runner man, come on by. You guys, this is not subtle. He's totally gonna know this is not a coincidence if the two of you are out here. Oh, you've been lurking out here for a week, [clucks tongue] I think he knows already. Sara, please take your popcorn inside. No. Listen, Chomps-a-lot, you are not helping things any. Oh, here he comes. Don't look. Don't look. Oh, my gosh, he's so cute. Oh, he is really cute. Don't look. Don't look. Say hi to him. Say hi to him. Hey, nice ass. You're hot. My friend thinks you're cute. He's single. Bye. He waved back. He waved back. What is wrong with you? Ben, he's really cute. You two suck. Grow some balls. He's cute. Yeah, we're helping you. We're trying to play matchmaker. That was definitely not helping me, and it was not playing matchmaker. No, because if we'd have played matchmaker, you'd be talking to him and not us. ♪♪ ['70s soul] [phone rings] Hey. [Callie] Hey Lover. What you doing? Going for a drink with Foxy. Wanna come out? Or are you still sitting on your lawn stalking... I mean, watering your plants? No bitch, I'm in for the night. I'm about to go to bed. Is that music I hear? Were you about to jerk off? No. ♪♪ [stops] Loser, you totally were. You probably have a candle burning. No, I don't have a candle burning. Okay, go drown yourself in your own cum. You know what? Kill yourself. Okay, I'll call you tomorrow, stalker. Night. I'm gonna call Ben and fuck with him. Get off of your lawn. I'm not even on my lawn. Yeah, you are. I can hear the cars driving back and forth in the background. I'm hanging up now. Loser. Stalker. Good-bye. [whispering] Just say hi. Just say hi. Just say hi. Just say... Jesus Christ. Oh, my God. What the fuck was that? I am so sorry. I think I missed the lawn. You think? Really? I am really, really sorry. Are you now? I'm sort of sorry. Hi, I'm Grey. I'm... I'm Ben. So do you spray down everyone with your hose? No. No, I don't know what that was. It was, like, out of control. You could have just said hi any day this week. What are you talking about? Well, the other day, you and your friends. What? You, two girls, bowl of popcorn. [laughing] I don't... um... yeah. You know, you're cute when you blush? Now, I'm not blushing. That's sunburn. Right, sunburn from all the days you've spent out in your yard stalking me. Stalking you? No, no, I didn't even notice you. My lawn is dry... Do you wanna just go out and get dinner one of these nights, or what? Yeah, I would like that actually. Um, tonight? Sure, tonight, now you're forward. You know, I had to run past your house for weeks just to try to get your attention. No. Yeah. Nice So tonight, 6:00-ish? Yeah, 6:00-ish. All right, tonight. Tonight. Bye, pup. Bye. So do you have any brothers or sisters? Two. Two sisters. Both married, kids, picket fence, whole nine yards. You? I do. I have one sister. She's 18 months older, has a little boy and a little girl. Very nice. Yeah. Wow. You don't want kids, do you? I don't know. I might. I like them. I think they're fun. Why, are you scared? No, it's... I don't know. I just... I like kids. I just like to be able to give them back when I'm done. I guess I just like my life the way it is right now. So, are you scared yet? No. Um, all time favorite food. Go. That's easy. It's pizza. Hands down, the best cheat food. Me, too, except for olives. I don't like olives either. That's freaky. Cool. Okay, let's see. How old do you think you were when you knew you were gay? Oh, wow, um. I was young. I used to love action figures, so I'd send them all into battle, but I never wanted the buff male heroes to get hurt so I'd always send the princess in first. And then in battle she died, so I took a pair of scissors and snipped off her head. That's a pretty harsh sentence for an action figure, don't you think? Yeah, I mean my parents were pissed, but I gave her a burial and buried her in the backyard. Well, sometimes the bitch has to die. Exactly. So I guess I always knew, or, I don't know, I knew I was different. What about you? Me, um, I don't know, I was like 10 or 11 maybe, however old you are in fifth grade, and we were all lined up to go see the school nurse, and, you know, get the whole turn your head and cough thing. We were in our underwear, and I got hard. So for the next five years, all I ever heard was, "Grey popped a boner." Yeah, thanks for laughing, thanks. I'm sorry. It pretty much made school a living hell, but, you know... Yikes. So what do you do for work? I own a fitness boot camp with my best friend. Nice, you get to scream and yell at people all day long. No, it's definitely not like that. What about you? Me? I am project manager for a designing firm. All right, so I have to ask you. It's an odd question, but you are single, yes? Definitely, yeah. You? Yes. I mean, you have to ask these days, right? I hear you. I hear you. So how long you been single for? Four years. Four years, Jesus. Why so long? I mean, okay, you're decent looking, and you're fairly funny, so... Oh, fairly funny? I don't want to over-inflate your ego just yet. I gotta sit here all night. Fair enough. Um... four years ago I was dating a guy... and he was HIV positive, but he didn't know it. He caught pneumonia, and three weeks later he died. Three weeks. Jesus, that is fast. The whole thing just tore me up. It broke my heart. The thought of being intimate or having sex with someone was just the furthest thing from my mind. That's rough. [mutters] I mean... yeah, rough. The worst part of it all was as sad as I was for him, at the end all I kept thinking was, "Thank God I'm negative." How sick is that? Yeah, it's... I can only imagine. I mean, that's just... That's intense. Enough of this story. It's not a first-date story. Um, what about you? How long have you been single and why? I've been single a couple years now. I broke up with my ex because we basically couldn't stand to be in the same room together. We fought constantly, and his idea of fun was going out for a weekend and not coming back until Monday morning. I'm kind of the type who sits at home and watches TV and has a beer. I guess I just got it all out when I was younger. I was pretty sexually adventurous, and, I don't know. I guess I just don't really date anymore. And why is that? Well, whenever it came time for the tough stuff in a relationship, it just became too hard, so I don't do it. I just have sex. Wow, well this is a date. No, this is hanging out. I'm gonna call this a date. Whatever, pup. All right, what is this little nickname, "pup"? I don't know, but it suits you, I think. I might like it. Good. So, it's getting late. Maybe I should let you get home and get to bed. Yeah, probably. I had a really nice time talking with you. You're real easy to be around. Thanks, you, too. I would really like to see you again. Yeah, I'd like that too, but... [sighs] I... I just need to be upfront and tell you this. I'm HIV positive. Oh, my God, I feel like such an idiot. No. No, no, no, don't do that to yourself. It's my issue, it's my skeleton, and I'll deal with it. I just want to know if you're going to be okay with it. I'd be lying if I said it didn't make me nervous, but I still really want to see you again. Good. Glad to hear it. You know, as I get older, its harder and harder to find guys that I have that spark with, that chemistry. I know if I wanna see someone a second time, within five seconds. It's just rare to meet those guys that you have all those same things in common with. Wanna settle down and be monogamous. I have never been in a monogamous relationship, and I have never been asked to be in one. Are you opposed to it? No, but let's face it. We're men. If I'm in a relationship with a boyfriend, and I go out and sleep with someone else, it doesn't mean I care about him any less. I don't get it. I don't think I understand. We're just getting to know each other right now, so let's just roll with it, okay? O-Okay. Oh, you're so fucking gay. You walked and talked? It was nice. Gay. Sweet. Homo. We're getting to know each other. Okay, Jack Twist, did you at least hold hands? No, but it was two men on a date, so, yeah, it was gay. I gotta tell you, though, I got a serious case of blue balls. Serves you right for having a Brokeback Mountain moment. Listen, Ben, you gotta have sex like a man does, you know? You gotta fuck like a man. Oh, like a man. Eat a dick. Eat a vagina. So when you gonna see him again? Tonight. Wow, two nights in a row? That's a big commitment. You sure you can handle that? Whatever. Hi, can I borrow that? Yeah. That guy was totally eye fucking you. No, he wasn't. He was looking at those ridiculous shorts. And I'm sort of seeing somebody. All right, first off, these shorts are not ridiculous. And two... Going for a walk does not mean that you are seeing somebody. Listen, I just can't juggle men, and, frankly, I don't want to. Yeah, you're a broad. Yeah, I'm a broad, and I'm done with this conversation. What are you getting into tonight? I don't know. I got work, and then Amber and I might have a beer. Okay, so the stripper/girlfriend, she's still around? Hey, hey, stripper yes, but, you know, yeah, so far so good. You know what you should do? You should take your man for a test drive tonight. How are we back on this conversation? We're not all sluts, and he's not a car. Yeah, you are. You're gay, and you're a dude. Okay, I'm gonna put this into language you can understand. We're not all man-whores. Hi. Hello, handsome. Don't you look nice. Thank you. So do you. Thanks. It's a nice place. What's this? [laughs] Thought you might ask. This is a carpet picnic. Oh, it's a carpet picnic. Yeah, it's like a picnic, but it's on the carpet A carpet picnic. Yeah. Sit down. So, I wasn't sure what you liked, so I got a little bit of everything. This looks great. Thank you. Champagne? That's classy, nice touch. Thank you. So how was your day? It was good. You really went all out here, didn't you? Yeah. I wanted to show you what it was like to be on a real date. Oh, this is a date. Yes, this is a date. I have to tell you. I really do have a crush on you. Really? Well, so you know, the feeling's mutual, so... to mutual crushes. To mutual crushes. So... you said you were from Jersey, right? Yeah, I grew up in northwest Jersey, and I grew up on a farm with all these animals running around, so I wanted to be a veterinarian as a kid. Then I realized you had to cut them open, so then I didn't want to be a veterinarian anymore. Yeah, well cutting animals open isn't so bad when you realize you're helping them. Yeah. So, where did you grow up? Me, I grew up in Cincinnati, been out here for about 12 years. I mean, I love the city, but eventually I'd like to move up north and just get out. To where? I don't know. Mendocino maybe, or Shelter Cove. I go hiking and camping up there a lot, so... I camp all the time. Yeah, I love to camp. Really? I do. What did you want to be when you were a kid? I wanted to race cars. How's that working out? Not so much. So, you know what else? When I was a kid... How about you just shut up and kiss me already? Yeah, I... well, I... No, no, no, no... There's no more talking, not for one whole minute. [cell phone rings] That's your phone. So? You should answer it. I mean, it could be important. It's not important. Now where were we? I don't know. I think the moment might have passed. I don't think so. Thank God. What? That you're a good kisser. I mean, what if you were a bad kisser, and, you know, there's this chemistry, but what if that was like, beginner's luck? I mean, I might need a do-over just to be sure. You want a mulligan? I do. So I did something today. Really, what was that? I went down to the Department of Public Health, and I spoke to a counselor about HIV, found out what things were safer than others. Really? Yeah. I know it's early, I just... Well, I like you, and I wanted to be prepared. [chuckles] That's, like, the nicest thing anyone's done for me in a long time. You know, I miss out on so much all because I have this damn bug, and I can't seem to get rid of it. I have zero viral load, but it's still there. It's okay. I really do like you. I like you, too. I wonder if you'd be good to cuddle with. Well, maybe one of these days, if you're nice, I'll let you find out. Yeah, but maybe I could just, you know, take you for a test drive, see how I fit in the nook. Into the what? The nook. Just lay on your back. I'll show you. Okay, so the nook is this area here. [sighs] Well? Survey says? It's nice. So do you do this on all your dates? Oh, I knew you'd call it a date, and, no, I do not. Well, this is nice. Mm-hmm. I don't really date that much. Me neither. Hey. Yeah. I should probably go. [yawning] Really? Yeah. Do you have to work in the morning? No. It's late, though. I should probably let you get to bed. You know, you could come to bed with me. Not for sex. I don't want to have sex with you. Well... I mean, I do want to have sex with you. I don't want to have sex with you tonight. Does that make sense? I'm rambling. Yeah, you're rambling. Yeah. So... why don't you go ahead and lead the way, handsome? Really? Yeah. Okay. Oh. You're just gonna get into bed fully dressed? I don't know. Yeah, I guess. Well, how about we take off some of these clothes and get a little more comfortable? Some of these clothes. Yeah. Such as? Let's start with the shirt. It's your turn. By all means. God, you're such a good kisser. That's because I have a good partner. Whoa, whoa, whoa... What? Let's just hang on for... I think we should behave. Slow down a little bit. Yeah, behave. No, you're right. We should slow down. Yeah. No, no... Dude, you have to get off because if you don't, I'm gonna fucking rape you. You can't rape the willing. All right. Sleep? All right, sleep, okay. One more kiss. All right, I'll be good. Get off. Off. Off. Goodnight. Goodnight. Oh, good morning, Sleeping Beauty. How are you? Good morning, handsome. How did you sleep? [sighs] Good. You? I slept good, too. Good. Listen, I gotta head out soon. No. No, no, no, that's okay... No, stay in bed with me. You got a big day planned? No, I'm just gonna work out. Yeah? What about you? I gotta head into the office in a while, but... I just gotta tell you that was a hell of a night last night. One heck of a date. Yeah, it was. So when can I see you again? I don't know. What are you doing later? Seeing you. Good answer. So, how's that blue ball situation, kid? It's the same. No sex. Just fuck already. It's been long enough. It's been two days, and I'm saving myself. For what? You're not a virgin, Ben. Well, I am with Grey. Do you even hear yourself? Yeah, but I really like this guy, and if the sex it bad, I'm gonna lose interest. So you move on. Next. You know, first time sex is always tricky. Aren't you the one who always told me, "The more you know somebody, the better sex is?" Yeah, that was me lying to myself. First time sex ever been tricky for you? No, I mean, I murder that shit, kid. How's that? Ok, listen. Sex and love are separate, right? Like, I could bang a broad and not love her. You... You get it all twisted. You think that just because you had sex, automatically you need to fall in love. That's ridiculous. No, it isn't. I separate what needs to be separated. You act like you're all moral, but you do the same shit except you create this huge fight to break up with the dude instead of being direct. No, I don't. You know, I used to do that, but that's just because I hadn't found the right guy yet. Or it's because you're just like me, and you're afraid to commit. No. Whatever. [phone rings] Oh, it's Grey. So answer it. No. No. He called you two times already today. Yeah? Listen, I can't be too readily available, okay? Oh, so now we're playing games, huh? It's not good, Ben. It's not good. You guys are so sweet. Ben and Grey making it official on Facebook. Yeah, we've been dating for a few months, so I figure, why not? Yeah. Really? Who does that? Isn't Facebook for, like, 14-year-old girls and future pedophiles? No. Listen, you're straight and married. I don't expect you to understand. Yes, but I think it's great. I change my Facebook status all the time on my Blackberry. I put up pictures today of my new piercing, everyone. Oh, T-M-I. New topic, anyone? [doorbell rings] Guys, please behave and do not embarrass me. Thank you. So Grey, do you know Ben has a phobia of commitment? Brad, stop. Grey, Ben is a great guy. Big ol' bottom. You hurt him, I'll fuckin' kill ya. Oh, Vinnie, if somebody hurts me, will you kill them? Zip it. So there's not really much of a warm up with this crew, is there? No, this is exactly why they've never met anyone I've dated before. Thank you for embarrassing me, guys. Thank you. glad we got that out of the way. Wait, you guys have never met anyone that Ben's dated, ever? You are officially the first. It's the darnedest thing, For some reason he never keeps them around long enough for us to actually meet... aah... Okay, I'm officially worried now. Don't be. We're an easy group. So Grey, you got a straight brother? No, two sisters actually, both married. That's a shame, because you're hot. Grey, if Ben brings you around, you are officially part of the family. And with that, ladies, let's go and make these boys some drinks. Like a good woman should. [slaps] Aah. You keep it up and no sex for you. I'll be right back. Don't go anywhere. You're mine. I miss you already. See what I'm talking about? She's got me in the fucking Cobra Clutch. Jesus. Vinnie, don't ever leave me. If I can't have you, nobody can. Because I'm a cuckoo psycho. Cuckoo. Keep laughing. You're boy is a funny guy. Wait till it happens to you. That's exactly what the fuck she's like. I'm back. I couldn't be away from you. Why do you gotta always hang on me? So Grey, you're a designer? Yeah, mainly I remodel high end hotels and stuff. Mm, do you think you can get us a discount on a hotel room? Uh, no, sorry. So Grey, I hear you don't believe in monogamy. Okay, Brad, thank you. Thank you for that, Brad. I have never shown you the back yard. Backyard... Code word for "backdoor"? Okay, let's go. So Grey was nice. Yeah. He's seems sweet, and you guys seem like you really like each other. Oh, my gosh, those sheep are so cute. Look at 'em. [sheep bleats] Yeah, I guess, for sheep. Why are sheep always the target for farmers to have sex with? I don't know. I've never had sex with a sheep. Well, that's good for you, but where is their hole even? Are you are kidding me? It's under their tail. Oh. Do you think it's because they don't kick like a horse does? Sara, I don't know. I've never had sex with any farm animal. I mean, I guess if I had to figure it out, I don't know, maybe it's because they don't bite? Oh, good point. I do like Grey for you, though. All right, out of left field. And I like Grey for me, too. Hey, you know he's gonna come over, and we're gonna have a take-out date tomorrow night. Do you wanna come over, too? And be the third wheel? No, thanks. A.D.D. Interiors. Who's this? Hi, Ben. How are you doing? Hold on one sec. Grey, it's your boyfriend. Knock it off. He's not my boyfriend. Shut up. Hey. Yeah, you need me to stop by the store and pick up anything? All right. I'll see you around 7:00. All right, bye. You got a date, huh? Look at you blush. You really like him. Shut up. Don't you got something you gotta file or something? No. Well find something. No, I don't. Yeah, you do. [laughs] You're awful quiet. You don't like the food? The food's fine. It's just... [sighs] I had a foreman fuck up on a job today, and it's just given me a headache. That sucks. Yeah. I'll tell you what. If you clear the table, I'll give you a back rub. Really? Really. A good one. You said something about a back rub? Yeah, well that was faster than expected. Lean back. Oh, God, that's good. So what exactly do I get if I mop the floor? Well, I am sure we can negotiate on something. [Grey chuckles] You are really tense. Did you have more than one problem at work today? Hello? Earth to Grey. Yeah. You got something on your mind? No, no. Actually yeah, I do. Have a seat. All right, well, this doesn't sound too good. All right... so after I got off the phone with you today, I... I hooked up with a guy. You what? Look, I didn't go out looking for it. It just happened. Oh, it just happened. It's just a guy that I hook up with from time to time. So this is a regular thing? Ben, when we got together, I told you that I didn't believe in monogamy. That's why I was so worried about dating you. Look, I think it's sweet that you can stay so green and keep your Midwestern values in a city like this, but... I'm green because I don't hook up with randoms. All right, okay, now, don't get so upset. I knew I shouldn't have told you. Yeah, you should have told me, but then you're gonna sit there and tell me this is all because I'm green because I don't hook up like a slut. But you are green, okay? That's what I like about you, but face it, you are green. I mean, have you ever been to a sex club? No. Ever had a three way? No, but that doesn't make me green because I'm not hooking up with randoms. But it does. I'm sorry if that offends you, but let's face it. I'm a man, and I'm not dead yet. You're a man, and you're not dead? Well how fucking Zen of you, Grey. Come on, grow up. You see, that's why I didn't want to tell you any of this. I didn't want this to upset you. Don't take it so personal. Don't take this personal? You don't think this all starts with us being personal? Come on, okay? Wrong choice of words. Just don't take it that way. Why don't you tell me how you did mean it? How about we spend the next few months just filling up your days and then you can run off and sleep with whomever you want? First of all, did you ever stop to think that this wasn't all about you? Huh? You're delusional. Second of all, maybe I'm falling for you, okay? Do you have any idea how hard that is for me? Well I might be falling for you, too, but if this is so hard on you, why would you sleep with someone else? Have you ever thought that I was terrified that I would get you positive? Do you have any idea what that's like? I live with that fear every day. That's really unfair. Now, I don't know what that's like, and I'm sorry to be insensitive, but you cheated. Grow up. I slept with someone. Look, you and I spend every day together. We go to the movies. We go hiking. No guy I've hook up with has slept in my bed. You do. No guy I sleep with has met my friends, but you have. You've got to factor that in, okay? I told you from day one that I was not monogamous. I don't say these things to hurt you, but you're the one who said you'd always wanna know. [weeping] I just didn't think it would feel like I got punched in the throat. I am sorry, okay? Am I doing something wrong? You can tell me. I just don't know why it wasn't me. No. I knew going into this that I was scared to date you. I was afraid that if something like this happened, you would wanna end it. Yeah, I wish I could. I can't, I'm all in. That's the problem. Ben... you've got to know you're the only thing that's makes me happy, okay? Your smile melts my heart. This whole thing, it's just really new for me, you know? I know. Just shut up and kiss me now, and let's just remember what we have, okay? ♪♪ [rock] Hey, you awake? I love you. [Callie] Wow, so he told you he loved you? Oh, he's so staying faithful, then. Yeah, but he told me while I was sleeping, so it doesn't really count. Oh, no, that just means he meant it more. He's not trying to get in your pants. He already got the goods, and he said it while you were sleeping. So you think he will stay faithful? Oh, babe, so staying faithful. Brad, you're the voice of reason. Do you think he's going to stay faithful? Depends how good the sex was. It is not about the sex. Ben, he will. Oh, baby. He's a man. It's always about the sex. Always about the sex. You guys, we're making sandwiches. That's gross. And if it is "about the sex," then you can give me a V, dot the I, cross the T, O, R, Y. What the fuck was that? Okay, that's a cheer, and it spells victory, duh. No, it doesn't, not at all. Yes, it does. Give me a V, dot the I, cross the T, O, R, Y. Victory. Yeah, that spells "vitory." What the hell's a vitory? Vitory-do. Whatever, fuck the both of y'all. It was great sex, okay? Oh, really? Are you in love with him? Oh, my God, listen. Am I gonna be the only voice of reason here? Ben, this guy's a waste of your time. No, okay, one... I think I might be falling in love with him, and two... I can't help how I feel, so can we just have a beer with lunch and celebrate my "vitory" sex? Can we also celebrate you being delusional? Brad, just stop. Just stop. And I can't. Yes, you can. Your husband thinks I'm a delusional train wreck, so you can have one beer with lunch. Shut up. [Callie] Mm-hmm. Are you serious? Oh, my God, congratulations. Thank you. I can't believe that. Right there. I cannot believe you guys let me ramble on and on about my stupid vitory sex. When did you find out? Last night. Oh, my God, so I know this is your moment and everything, but I cannot believe I'm gonna be an uncle. I can't believe it. Oh, my God, what are you gonna name it? I don't know. What if it's a boy? I could name it Benny. Benny! Baby Benny. Baby Benny. Oh, Baby Benny, that's so cute. No, it's... double no. No, we'll talk about that... You'll be lucky if you even get to baby-sit, commitment-phobe. Oh, I'm gonna baby-sit your baby. No, we're gonna pay for the little girl across the street. Just trust me. Yeah, your baby's gonna be a diva. I can't believe I'm gonna be an uncle. I know, that's pretty awesome. Callie and Brad have been trying for a while. Yeah. God, I love the way you feel. I can't imagine not being around you. Me either. Yeah, just let me finish, okay? You are one of the most thoughtful, fun guys I've ever been around... not to mention you are sexy as hell. Thank you. I can honestly look to the future, and I can see us with our own place, one or two dogs running around the backyard. Maybe three. Two. Okay? Okay. And having said all this... I love you. And I cannot fathom having to break your heart again. So don't. You didn't break my heart. Yes, I did, and it's not that easy. I slept with another guy again. Tell me I did not just hear that. You love me, and you're sleeping with random men? It's not that easy to explain. I'm sorry. I don't want you to be sorry. I want you to just want to be with me. How fucking pathetic and desperate do I sound? Just like that, you expect me to change? I told you from the beginning, this is who I was. Okay? I can't change who I am, and neither can you. I just don't understand. Look, what happens if I have an indiscretion and you break it off? Huh? You'd be willing to throw all this away over something so stupid and meaningless? If it is so meaningless then why are you doing it? It's just who I am, but I'm trying, okay? You're not trying, Grey. This is not rocket science. It's sex. It doesn't just happen. That's something you hear in a movie. Okay, it's not "I'm walking down the street, and my pants fell off and my dick fell in his mouth." All right, quit being an asshole, okay? Yeah, I'm the one that's being the asshole. All right, look. I knew there was no way I was ever going to be able to tell you all this... so I wrote it down for you in a letter. Great. You love me. You're sorry you're sleeping with other men, and you're writing it in a letter. You're breaking my heart here. I hope you know that. Just calm down, read the letter, and call me later, okay? Why? You obviously won't have a problem moving on. Hey, don't get like this, okay? Don't... Don't touch me. Don't be this way. Don't shut down. Yeah, just go. Just go. All right. Fine. Oh, wait. What? Hello? Why did you sleep with those other guys? Jesus, Benny, we're here again? We just had this conversation two seconds ago. Look, I know you're angry, but there is nothing I can say that's gonna change your mind or fix your broken heart. I am trying to be okay with this. You are, you're trying, but you're not. You're just like me. We're two grown men, and we're both set in our ways. I am so sorry. I'm not doing this to be selfish, okay? I just want you to know that I can't do this knowing that I'm going to break your heart again. Um... What? You can't even talk about it now when it's the easy stuff. What's gonna happen later on down the road when it's the tough stuff? I don't want you to go. I just don't want you to sleep with other people. Oh, is that all? Look, I need someone who's going to be truly okay with this, and it's not you. I want you to understand I'm not doing this to hurt you. [whispering] Ben, Ben, God... Ben, Ben. [both weeping] I don't want you to feel this way. I am so sorry. You're sorry. You... You are sorry. You should go. You're right. You're not going to change, and you know what? Neither am I. Ben, please. Ben, come on. No. No. You know what? You're pathetic. You're pathetic. You can't do this? I can't do this. This is done. Okay, did you hear me? It's done. Don't call me. Don't write me. Just go. Please, just go. [whispers] Ben, please... Just go. Get out of my house. [weeping] Fuck. There he is. He's right there. Oh, he looks cute. Ben, over here. Hi. Ben, this is Gage. Gage, Ben. Hi. Hi. You know this is a total set up, right? No, no it's not. It's okay. You didn't tell me your friend was this handsome. I know, right? That's why he's my gay boyfriend. So, Gage, does Callie do this to you often, the whole set up thing? Every chance she gets. Glad to know I'm not the only one. Oh, my, I think I have to go. I have an appointment. No, you don't. I do. I gotta go. You don't. I do... Oh. No. What's wrong with you? Don't turn around. Why not? Are you guys okay? Grey is right behind you. Who's Grey? Nobody. Are you okay? I'm fine. Let's just order. No, I think we should just go. Look, I'm fine. Let's just order, okay? We'll go somewhere else. It's fine. It's fine... Hi guys, um... sorry, I didn't wanna make this awkward, so I decided to come over here and make it more awkward. Hi, Callie. Yeah, hi. Have you met Gage? This is Ben's new boyfriend? What? Yeah, they're in love, so you can leave. Thanks. Not my new boyfriend. Callie. Do you mind if we talk alone for a minute? Ben, you don't have to give him the time of day. Callie, just give me a minute. I'm sorry. Just for the record, I think you suck. Ben is a hell of a guy. Ben, we'll be right out front. Mind if I have a seat? Fine. So how have you been? Fine. And you? Fine. Actually, completely miserable. What do you want, Grey? I called you, like, a dozen times and you didn't return one call. Okay, I know. I should have called, but... Yeah, but you didn't call. You know I'm seeing a therapist now? They agree with my friends. You're not that good for me. Yeah, I know I'm not the easiest person to get along with here, but I really thought we had something special... Yeah, I thought so, too, but I was wrong. I still don't want to share you with anybody. I don't think anything's changed, so what's the point? The point is I miss you, okay? That ship's sailed. Really? You know what I don't get? I called you for a month. You didn't return one of my calls. Now I stop calling, and all of the sudden you're interested. You're playing these head games, and, frankly, I deserve better than that. All right, you do. Okay, I'm sorry. I told you from the beginning that I am not good with relationships... You can stop with your disclaimers, okay? I listened to you, and now you can listen to me. This, there is nothing here. It's done. You sure? No... but I know I can't give you the opportunity to break my heart again. I have to go. Goodbye. [Ben] Well, I told him we could set some ground rules. [Man] And how did that make you feel? Scared, excited, I don't know. You know he gave me a letter? Broke my heart, but, boy, could he kiss. Yes, I believe you mentioned that. He's not as bad as my friends say. No? I guess I always believed that I would end up with somebody who really honored monogamy. And now? How do you feel? For me, in relationships, honesty is more important than monogamy. That doesn't answer the question, though. I guess I don't really have an answer to that question. You could help me out, though. Oh, how is that? Well, you could lay on top of me and kiss me. I love you. Me, too. It's what happens when you stop judging people and accept them for who they are. ♪♪ [pop] Closed-Captioned By J.R.
