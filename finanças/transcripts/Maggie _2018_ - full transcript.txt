"How do you travel to space without a spaceship? Get a job in an X-ray room. Because the human body is a universe," said the radiographer. EVERYONE LIKES THE X-RAY ROOM. Inhale. Now exhale. Her boyfriend came to take an X-ray. Hold your breath. Hold your breath. I present to you, Love of Maria Hospital. It was a convent 30 years ago. The priest left a will saying, "always treat the poor first." But the hospital director had other plans. He established a private hospital. It's lunchtime. 'LUNCHTIME 12:30 - 13:30' The staff doesn't like the cafeteria food. They eat out. That nurse is the last to leave the building. It's quiet. Who's that? What was that? Someone outside pushed the X-ray button. Regardless of their will, their insides... were revealed. 'LAUNDRY' One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Oh, come on! Hey mister! Come on out! I caught you red-handed. What? - Come on out! - Why? Stop pretending to be busy! What do you want? I got you now! You didn't wash all of these, did you? Huh? That post-it. It came out of this shirt. Were you swamped? No way! No way my ass! I didn't ask you to dry-clean. No way this post-it survives. You betrayed my trust. Be twice as thorough next time, okay? I paid you, right? Bye. Take this! No thanks. It was just this one time. Okay? It won't happen again! THE NURSE ALSO LIKES THE X-RAY ROOM. Shit! I'd hate to buy a new phone. "When we fall into a pit, what we need to do... is not dig any further, but quickly climb out." The nurse read the note and thought, "let's not think about it." Do you know who did this? It wasn't me. The people in the hospital began their own investigation. They wanted to know who were in this photo. Nobody cared about who took the X-ray. "Who were the stars of this photo?" That was their only interest. The nurse thought those hips belonged to Yoon-young. Yeo Yoon Young. Hey, Yoon-young! Let's go home! Don't run. Am I heavy? Not super heavy. Bouncy bouncy. Look at all these hospitals. - Hospitals? - Yeah. It's not like I have nowhere else to go. There are hospitals everywhere! I'm not scared! Those are churches. - They are? - Yeah. Look, they're churches. - Doesn't matter. - You get that from the crosses? - Sung-won. - Yeah? It's going to be okay, right? What is? You know... Everything. Everything will be fine. Have another one. Eat up. No, you have one first. Yeah, go ahead and eat one. Sung-won. What are they doing? Protesting. They're protesting redevelopment. In a peaceful manner. That's awesome. I want to join them. Let's. Do you have a swimsuit? What are they planning to build here? I don't know. I think it's mine. Get up for a second. Stand still. I think it's yours too. Hold it up against me. Flip it around. Tilt it. Okay, good. I can't really tell. I think it's mine. It's ours. No, it's not! Fuck... I told you we shouldn't do it in the hospital. What do we do now? What do I do? How did they take this? Let's quit. 'Resignation Letter' The letters are so complicated. Maybe it's to stop people from resigning. Hey, wait... I think you've misunderstood me. When I said "let's quit," I didn't mean let's quit the hospital. I meant let's quit thinking about this situation. Quit all the doubting and struggling. Do you get what I'm trying to say? No, do you? This is no good. Pass me the pen. 'Leaving the Hospital' This is too in your face... Pick one. Let's have a tournament. I haven't seen anything like this before. Losing this one. Now these two. We have a winner! No point keeping these. I don't even have a job. This is the one! They say the life of an adult is enduring misunderstandings. But this can't be right! Forget it... THE FINAL CLOCK IN. Clocking in was too hard anyway. Vice-president Lee encouraged physical activity for all employees. She will no longer be forced to burn calories. 0.6 1.2 1.8 Kcals. Nurse Yoon-young Yeo has clocked in. Before she quits, she tries lunch in the cafeteria. It's still awful. People can be so mean. I'm here to have lunch with you. You're not wearing your uniform. - 'In Surgery.' - 'Vice-president of Orthopedics: Kyung-Jin Lee' Here. Open up. I wanted to speak to you anyway. I'll go first. Someone saw you leave... with the X-ray photo. Who told you that? I can't reveal that information. Was it you? I swear it wasn't me. Fine, it was one of the doctors. Bunch of children... It's a tough situation, I know. But I wouldn't worry about it. We'll decide what to do after the meeting. What meeting? Lunch break is over. We can talk about it later. I think you'd better go home and rest. Why do I have to rest? I'll get back to you soon. You can leave now. Okay. Nurse Yeo. Leave through the back door. Why? I'm not using the back door. It's for your own sake. No, I'm not quitting the hospital. I'm still going to work here. Nurse Yeo. See you tomorrow. I'll get back to you. Get some rest. See you tomorrow. - Okay, get some... - See you tomorrow at the hospital. REHIRED. It's already late. But nobody has shown up yet. Someone did a good job drying these peppers. Hello? This is Dr. Lee. I'm calling because you haven't come to work... I just want to know what's going on. Why haven't you come to work? Oh, you're feeling sick... Right... Then you should've called. It would've saved me the trouble. Okay. Take good care of yourself. I'll see you tomorrow. Bye. Good morning! Hold on, nurse Yeo! Don't ask me to quit! I've just clocked in. I'm going to work here! That's not it. We have a situation. 'Employee List' 'Section Chief: Myung-Jin Kim.' Hi, this is nurse Yeo. I'm calling because you haven't come to work. Hi, this is Dr. Lee. 'Sick' Nobody showed up except for Dr. Lee and Yoon-young. Has everyone made love in the X-ray room? Liars. I know they're not showing up tomorrow either. What's wrong with having sex in the X-ray room? Beliefs often change. Why do people have to lie? Just say that you've quit. I hate liars. Dr. Lee. You think that everybody's lying, don't you? But it's possible that they're all really sick, right? Wow... It chimes! Your daughter is very pretty. It's me. ATTEMPTED MURDER. Attempted murder! Attempted murder! A boy in my neighborhood fell from an apartment roof. But do you know what rumor began to spread? That I jumped onto the seesaw, and he was at the opposite... I can't even... Take your time. That I jumped on the seesaw and sent the boy at the other end flying. The problem was he didn't explain what really happened. He should've told the truth. His dad pushed him off the roof. But I didn't feel like explaining myself either. So I just lived with it. What's the point of this story? There's nothing you can do. No matter what I say, some will believe me and some won't. During your entire life, no one has ever put their absolute faith in you, right? Belief. Trust? Would you like to try a trust exercise? No, it's okay. We'll pick two people. Let's be simple. Be simple. Then we'll see if they are lying or not. If they are telling the truth, from then on, we'll believe in people no matter what. Do you get what I'm saying? But if they're lying? TRUST EXERCISE. 'Jin-sung Kim' Then only doubt will grow. Shall we go visit Dr. Kim first? What is it? My medical bag! As she watched Dr. Lee bring her medical bag, Yoon-young thought to herself, "Dr. Kim. Please be sick." Nurse Yeo. I don't think this is appropriate. I think someone's inside. That's why it's inappropriate! Is anybody home? I really don't know if we should be doing this. I see a plate full of fruit. Where? I think they're having a tea break. Looks delicious. Nurse Yeo. Let's just leave. Wait, Listen! No, thank you. I'd rather not. Is everything okay? Thank you so much. Goodbye. Pay me through my Swiss bank account. Hurry up! With faith as our sword... And doubt as our shield... We charge! Doctor! Doctor! Doctor! Doctor! Let's believe in people from now on. You're right. Let's skip our visit to the second guy. I was peeling an apple. We'll begin the operation. Please. Make it painless. Try to relax. You're cruel! You said you got hurt peeling an apple. What? That's not what I said. I said I was hunting an ape. I guess you could mistake ape with apple. I caught an ape yes. But I didn't cut an apple. I did cut my fingernails though. I clipped them too short. I knew I was going to have a bad day. You have to believe him! It hurts! Don't you think we should call the police? We've decided to believe. Then what? Just let him go? Nobody thinks he was peeling an apple! - He could've used a big knife. - What about the ape? You heard him say apple! I don't know! I have a bad memory. Fortunately, he won't be waking up for a while. How come? I injected him with an anesthetic instead of an anti-inflammatory. Why did you do that? Because I felt that you didn't believe him. Jesus! Who's that? It's okay. He's my boyfriend. He's here just in case. Why bring Mr. Baseball Bat if we're believing in people? I have 99% trust, and 1% of doubt. How long does the anesthetic last? 40 minutes. "I was sure the moment I saw the bullet." "A Ready Wit Spurred from Doubt. Vice-president Lee and Nurse Yeo." Where's my name? What good did you do? You broke a window for no reason. Right? I told you not to wear my underwear. I didn't mean to break it. I was just trying to help. I don't know why you have to humiliate me like that. I would've liked my name in here too. By the way, I'm pretty good at fighting. Don't come near me. Try and stop me. - I'm telling you I'm good. - Stop it. I said, stop it. I warned you! I didn't hit you! Why did you hit me? How much longer? Almost done. Pretty, isn't it? It doesn't hurt anymore, does it? Captain Marvel? Erase it. Okay. The next day, everything returned to normal. Yoon-young visited me as usual. She says that seeing me still helps her relax. So when I hear her footsteps, sometimes I try to stay perfectly still. I haven't introduced myself yet. My name is Maggie. Yoon-young, do you still believe the X-ray image is yours? Hey, Maggie! I have a special gift. Yoon-young, they say that truth cannot exist wholesomely. My father says that truth is always manipulated by the people around it. Eat up. I'm actually a fruit maniac. There's no fruit I can't eat... except for one thing. It's tangerines peeled by someone else. Not now, back then. I'm sorry but... Did you wash your hands? Emergency! It's an earthquake! We have to evacuate from this building right now! It's urgent! I'm not joking! So refreshing! What are you doing? He says an earthquake's coming. There's no time! Maggie jumped so high that water splashed onto the floor! She must have sensed a diastrophism. I'm telling you! Shouldn't we alert the hospital? What if it's nothing? I can't even move freely. Listen. I read in an article that after a catfish had jumped high, an earthquake occurred 6 or 7 days later. This is a sign of an earthquake! Second floor. Father finally convinced everyone. But a new concern began to surface. "What if there isn't an earthquake?" Where are you guys going? Hey, Maggie! When is the earthquake coming? I'm bored! 3 HOURS LATER. - Sorry, sorry. - Hurry up! Be careful, or your bones won't heal. Actually, a little exercise is good for your bones. Go back! Go back! Aren't we supposed to be hiding under desks or something? I guess... I'm not sure if it's good to gather around like this. Nice shot! I doubt it's an earthquake. Nothing's happened for hours. Let's stop playing. Isn't it time for you to get off work? It was over a while ago. Let's go. Where is the bookworm? She went back to the ward. I should've just stayed too. Sung-won, did you feel the ground shake? Was there an earthquake? When are you going to get a job? Who's there? Hello? It's me. Sorry I'm late. Today's menu is a flower pot. Bon App?tit! Jesus! On that day, there was a diastrophism in Korea. It wasn't a big earthquake, but sinkholes the size of three vans appeared all over Korea. Why would anyone throw trash into that hole? The sinkholes brought great joy to one person in particular. You see, Sung-won found a job. Youth from all over the country were sent to restore the roads. The government treated the sinkholes as a mere nuisance. But in fact, they brought hope to the youth. Excuse me! What's going on here? How are you? We're restoring the road from sinkholes. So drive safe. Can I stay and watch? No, you can't. Drive safe. Why would anyone want to stay and watch this? Is he here to sleep or work? He seems smart, but he's not cut out for this work. He does seem nice, though. I think he looks a bit mean. Does he? Hey, what are your plans after this? I'll find other work. I need to make money. Whenever a sinkhole appears, do you know what I think? What? If I'd known I could get a job this easily, I wouldn't have studied so hard back in high school. I applied for English classes this month. I thought you were going to work. Who knows if there'll be work. You're wasting your time. I'm just worried, okay? Don't you have a high score for English? I do. Are you winding me up? I'll shoot you with this. Sung-won, aren't you going to leave? Let's go already! I've lost my ring. Please try again. Place your card on the reader. Why doesn't it work? Please try again. Place your card on the reader. Why don't they fix this already? Sung-won Lee has clocked out. It's actually white gold, not silver. Dong-hyun Hwang has clocked out. Did you say white gold? Yeah. I'm in the red today. My daily pay doesn't even cover it. - I don't think it'll be easy to find. - What do I do? Kang-sub Park has clocked out. It's too white here. I don't think we'll spot it. I'm so sorry Yoon-young. Hey, be careful! I'm sorry. What's wrong? My girlfriend bought me the ring. She'll kill me if I lose it. Check these pockets too. Where did it go? Maybe you dropped it into the sinkhole? No. I was wearing it there. I lost it here. Let's go downstairs and look for it. - Will you guys help? - Yeah, let's go have a look. Okay, great! MY PRECIOUS? Why are we still looking? It's not here. I'm exhausted. Did he really lose it here? Even if he did? How are we going to find it here? Let me sit down for a bit. Then don't look for it. Let's pretend to look for it at least. Fuck it. I'm leaving in 5 minutes. Hey guys, why don't we look for it at section B? Okay, why not? Great, let's go over there. - Sure. - Take your time. It was white gold, damn it! The ring's name was Maxine. The ring? It hurt, so I took it off. My fingers are all swollen up... from all the hard work. These chestnuts are so bitter. - Huh? - They're bitter. They're sweet. Your mind is bitter. Where did you get these anyway? JI-YEON, SUNGWON'S EX-GIRLFRIEND. Pop quiz. Do you think seagulls can recognize people's faces? Since you phrased it like that, I guess they can? A while ago, Sejong Station performed an experiment with a seagull. When the researcher revisited the seagull's nest... the seagull remembered the researcher and attacked. It's hard to believe, isn't it? Yes. How's Sung-won? Good. I wanted to meet you so that I can ask you directly. I figured... you came because on some level, you wanted to know too. Did you fight a lot? What do you mean? Do you think we fight too often? We're characters in Street Fighter. I have a knife. Okay? I said I'm holding a knife. You're frightening. Are you wearing perfume? Why? Do you know this scent? Huh? Is it familiar? Not really. I'll go fetch the water. You're doing all the work. Hey! Sung-won. Hey. Hey! What is it? "MOM." When she first saw the tattoo, she thought he was a loving son. Ji... But now? She sees "Ji-yeon." Yeon... I also got a tattoo. Not just an eyeliner tattoo. Where? I have one too. No, you don't. Under my tongue. Under your tongue? I thought I knew everything about you. Show me. Do you want to see it? Yeah, show it to me. You have to be quick. I'm only showing it once. Do you see it? If you can't sleep, just say so. "The word... The word had broken off the beauty of the flower... before I could feel it was beautiful. I've lost the flower. The first attack." Let's go when you're done. Okay. I'm ready to go. Come on down, let's go home. Let's go! One minute. I want to read a bit more. Read what? Get down from there. Just a little bit more. I feel I have to read this right now. I can't stand waiting for delicious food. There's sand in my mouth. It's really cold outside. Check, please! Are those seats available now? Not anymore. Sit down. I like our team. We get on very well. Did you find your ring? We looked for it together, didn't we? I think somebody stole it. I'm going to kill the son of a bitch. Was it you? Do you know what his nickname was? Hey, shut up! What was it? His hands were fast as lightning. Couldn't even see them. Why are we telling old stories? You're right. Players shouldn't reveal each other's pasts. Are you going to look for the ring today, too? Of course. Absolutely. You guys will help, right? Sure! His wish is our command! Why aren't you eating? I was saving that. Why didn't you tell me earlier? How was I supposed to know? Are you sure you left it there? At the restaurant? Who carries cash these days? Hi, I'm not sure if you remember, we had breakfast there earlier? We were the sinkhole team. The thing is... Yes, that was us. Near the kitchen. I think we left a wallet there. Did you see it? Oh... Really? Well, okay. Okay, thank you. She said we took it with us. What the hell? How much was in your wallet? 120 dollars. Hey, Kang-sub. Yeah? If I give you 120 dollars... will you sell me the ring? What ring? The one you're wearing. I'm not wearing a ring. The ring. I saw you wear it. 'SINKHOLE REPAIR' - Another sinkhole? - Tell me about it. Is that a real person? It's a person! What the hell... Oh my god... - What's he even doing? - Seriously. This is unreal. Hey! We're real people who can hear you. We weren't laughing at you. We were laughing at him. I wasn't talking to you either. Go on, now. Hey, what are you doing? Kang-sub, come sit here. I'm okay. My hands are too dirty right now. You don't need hands to sit. Come have a seat. I'm fine. The ground is cold. Maybe later. My hands are too dirty. How many times do I have to ask? I don't want to! Fine. Then don't. Hey. Give me the money you mentioned. Why? Do you want to sell the ring? Okay, just give it to me. Fuck! You scared me! I'm not going to bilk you. Give me the fucking money. Why are you cussing? The ring. Happy now? Aren't you coming? Sure. What's wrong with your friend? He gets sensitive sometimes. - I'll go talk to him. - Yeah, talk to him. See you tomorrow. - Okay, bye. - Bye. It's a toe ring. Of course, it doesn't fit. THE STORY I NEVER KNEW. That's it! Don't stand up quickly. Don't cross your legs. Stretch frequently. The first step of treatment is posture. Cut! Mark. - Doctor! - Yes? Did you write the script yourself? Yes. Isn't it great? Isn't that animal abuse? Is there a problem? One second... According to your script, people don't need to go to hospitals. Leg crossing and stretching cures everything? Isn't there anything else? How about this? Do you avoid over-examination? Are you experienced in treatment? Do you use genuine medical devices? Do you believe? Yes! Love of Maria Hospital will always say, yes! Yes! Always, yes! Mr. Director, what do you think? I'm sorry but the director says you look like a poacher. What? An illegal wildlife poacher. The price humans pay for evolution. Upright walking takes a toll on the human body... in the form of spinal diseases! Dr. Lee. Have you ever hit... No, I mean... Have you ever been hit by someone? No. My parents never even hit me. I thought so. But I do have an anecdote about violence. Well, nothing is certain right now... but if I tell my friends, they'll tell me to break up with him. I thought I could ask you for your insight. Feel free to talk. In high school, my friends said I would be a great counselor. Did Sung-won ever hit you? No... Never. Well... He hit me. She said that timing didn't really matter. She was too young back then. She didn't know what to do. But she says she's still suffering from the memory. So she's decided to do something about it. Are you surprised? If I were you, I would ask Sung-won directly. A clich? answer, right? Where are you going? Huh? I said where are you going? Getting changed so quietly... It's the middle of the night! The sun isn't even up yet! It's dark outside! You know I work at night. I'll see you later. Yoon-young visits me more often these days. She gets off work with Sung-won, has dinner with him, and shares the bed with him. Nothing has changed, but she knows something is different. Yoon-young. Take me out of here. We have a sinkhole job near the Aeronautical University. Yes, it's near Sang-am DMC. We'll take it. We're at 1740 Mapo, Seoul. Okay, copy that. Redevelopment has been declared. Yoon-young was also ordered to move out. Hello? 1,000 for the deposit, and 500 for the rent? Basement floor? No way! I want a half-basement! What? Okay, I'm on my way. During daytime when Sung-won is not at work, he looks for a house where Yoon-young can stay. Get over here ASAP. This house is awesome! Come quick! Some other lady is here too. I think she wants this place. It's on a steep hill, but the roads are heated. THE STAIRS OF DEATH. If we deposit 2,000, they'll lower the rent. We can't raise the deposit. Where the hell is it? There's a grocery store nearby too. Do you see "Chung-Nam Groceries"? You mean, "Chung-hyun"? You're right, "Chung-hyun"! The owner's an old lady. She seems really nice. I don't think she's strict. She even gave me a snack. Turn right at the corner! But the tenant smokes in the house so it reeks of cigarettes. The owner asked if you smoke. Just say no. Oh no... The other lady is about to sign a contract. She's asking where the bank is. Don't come. It's over. Where the hell are you? Yoon-young! Can you hear my voice? Yoon-young! Hey! You should've warned me about the stairs! I almost tripped over and fell! Are you insane? I didn't know you were coming that way. Fear can stretch out to the imagination. Because reality can be harsher than we imagine, right? How do I kill you? You have to disappear. I'm sorry, but goodbye. I'll see you tomorrow. What are you doing? Yoon-young has decided... to believe Ji-yeon. What's wrong with you? You wanted me to fall down the stairs and die! You're ridiculous. Am I wrong? You're wrong. Really? Yoon-young. Don't you smell gas right now? Am I leaving the gas valve open on purpose? So I can die with you? Is that it? Who knows? If you're that suspicious, I can light the lighter for you. Do you want me to? Don't. I'm lighting it. I can't believe you're suspicious of this too. See? Nothing! Wake up Yoon-young! You're nuts! Get the fuck out of my face! Good! I was worried that you'd follow me when I move. Okay, I'll leave. I'll pack my stuff and leave. I'll go. No big deal. Are you kidding me? That's my Macbook! What are you talking about? You broke my bike, so it's mine. Take this instead! I know how much you love this. I don't fucking need it. Thank you! Take off my underwear. You wear it all the time! I'm not wearing it! It's in my room. Take it. Okay, I will take it. Take off that shirt as well. This? Sure thing. Shit! You know what? Just take the Macbook. You won't have any money once all the sinkholes are filled up. By the way, you borrowed 2,000 from me, right? It's not 2,000. I paid the movers 850 when you moved in here. Do the math! 2,000 minus 850. It's 1,150 dollars, right? That's what I'll give you. My account is blocked right now. Can you lend me 1,150 dollars? You can say no. No, it's very sudden I know. I'm the one who's sorry. No, I'll have the money tomorrow, but I need it now. How can you not know your pin code? Okay. I have a call coming through. Wait! I have to take this. Hello? Give me a minute. Why won't the door open? I changed the code. Yoon-young! Yoon-young! What? Did you really change the code? Yeah. Check your account! Did you call your mother? Did you ask her for money? It's 1,200 dollars! 50 is the interest, retard! Hey, give me that bag! This is mine. Not that one. The small one. Where? Take this shit! You'll regret this Yoon-young. Oh, I almost forgot. Can you detach the bidet, please? That'll be 50 more. What are you talking about? That wasn't in your estimate. I didn't estimate that you'd have this much stuff! It's endless! How about 20? I'm helping too, aren't I? 30. I can do 30. 20, and that's final. It's 30. I said 20. Do you want me to load your bike? Oh my... What happened to this bike? Yoon-young decided to leave the bike. Sung-won no longer knows where Yoon-young lives. DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO, 2002. This is the story of Dr. Lee while she treated patients in Congo. There she released into the world... a western lowland gorilla named Shaun White. Go and be free! Go. That's right. But gorilla Shaun White didn't want to leave Dr. Lee. Dr. Lee donates ten thousand dollars annually... to help save endangered animals from all over the world. Stretch frequently. The first step of treatment is posture. Of the patients, for the patients, by the patients. Visit Love of Maria Hospital. Sung-won has a nice voice. You should've spent more money, if you were going to play it in fancy places like this. Well, I like it! But next time I shoot an ad, I want to add one more thing. You know... A good saying. Even if it doesn't really fit. What saying? I use it quite often. But please keep it to yourself. I don't want others to steal it. "When we fall into a pit, what we need to do... is not dig any further, but quickly climb out." I knew you'd call. Come on out. I'm in front of your house. I don't want to. Hey, it's a catfish! What's a catfish doing here? A patient who left wanted me to look after it. So it's abandoned. It's not abandoned. It's the same thing. How is it the same thing? Forget it. You're always doing this. Are you here to team up with the catfish and gang up on me? Bringing along a catfish, now? Hey... I have something to say to you. I saved it on my phone. I'll read it for you. Stop. Just read it there. Once, I doubted one of my co-workers. Thinking back now, I was letting my imagination expand like a balloon. If you think you also have something expanding inside you... I would like to pop it with an enormous needle. But painlessly. Have you ever hit a woman? Yes. What? I hit my ex-girlfriend. Whoa! What the fuck! Yoon-young! Hey, Yoon-young! Yoon-young! Is anybody there?
