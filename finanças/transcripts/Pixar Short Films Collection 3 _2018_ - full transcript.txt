Hi, my name is Sanjay Patel. I'm the director of Sanjay's Super Team. And I'm Nicole Grindle, the producer. I was just thinking about the "Based on a true story, mostly true story." We realized that we wanted people to know that this wasn't some story about Hinduism, but this was your story. Yeah, I think a fun detail is that we wanted the TV and the shrine to be exact same shapes, the incense on the father's shrine to mirror the bunny ears on the television. And little Sanjay is on the western side of the room, on the left, and his dad is on the eastern side, on the right. I love that 2D cartoon, but, man, it was so hard. Pixar is known for doing 3D computer animation, and so when we have to work on 2D animation, it's actually a bit of a struggle for us. The problem was that I wanted this low-budget, cheesy, bad Saturday-morning cartoon and we showed it to John Lasseter. Things really backfired. John pointed out, "If your kid is watching this TV show, "and if it's not cool, he's going to seem dumb "and our audience is not going to care when the father turns off the TV." And, once he said that, I was like "Duh," and I had to beg, beg, and beg Ms. Nicole here for some extra time to fix our big mess. So, in the altar the father produces a diya, and for folks who don't know, a diya is the small, little brass candle. Diya was one of the titles of the film that we'd actually considered because light in this short is the metaphor for history and culture. So, the first time you see the father's altar, there's three principal deities, Vishnu, Durga, and Hanuman, and they're very specific to my father's practice at home. I really wanted Vishnu because he represents preservation, and you can always spot Vishnu because he's always depicted in blue. Hence, blue flame is blue, this little kid's pajama's blue, and again, that links to Vishnu. Light is a big theme. Once the boy blows out this candlelight, he's disrespecting what his father's culture is about, blowing out and extinguishing this tradition. And I just felt, for a pantomime short, that this sort of lamp of knowledge could be a very universal idea. Once he blows out the light of that world, you sort of let in the bad forces, which is represented by this bad guy that emerges. I do think that that monster's pretty scary. A lot of people questioned it when we were making the film, and we thought that although it was scary, little Sanjay is empowered. That, although the kids were scared, they could identify, see themselves as that hero. Absolutely. We have all these statues being destroyed here by this bad guy. He's very much doing what this little kid was doing, disrespecting his father's culture. And little Sanjay figures out really early on that the first thing he needs to do is light that candle. Right, and the second that diya gets lit and that big burst of white light, you have this amazing transition in this temple. The deities come to life, bringing to life his father's world through this kid's imagination. We transition into this high-contrast lighting, and the thing that I was really after was this union between this two-dimensional cartoon and this three-dimensionality that Pixar is so great at, where it feels like stylized comic book come to life. This scene was so hard. Do you remember that? We found out right from the get-go that the temple wasn't big enough to achieve this kind of anime approach. When it came time to animate the three deities, I really was searching for something very specific. I didn't necessarily want them to move like superheroes that we had sort of come to know in the west. And, I just thought, well, heck, these deities have been brought to life for thousands of years in the dance tradition and theater traditions of India, and so we found Katherine Kunhiraman. She was a dance instructor. We did a great session with her and the animators. She helped us actually choreograph Vishnu to Bharatanatyam, Hanuman to Kalaripayattu, and with Durga, she mapped on the Odissi dance tradition. You really feel like you're looking at something that's from South Asia. We had to work really hard to make it clear that little Sanjay's seeing the diya upside down as looking like a bell. The sound designer even added a bell sound to it, too, when the camera spins and sees the bell shapes. It was always very important to me that the bad guy didn't get vanquished, that he doesn't get destroyed, but he gets calmed down. I mean, that's exactly what my dad was trying to do growing up. He just wanted me to sit still, meditate, and to calm down, and obviously, that's torture for a six-year-old. But now as a 40-year-old, I can really see the benefit and the wisdom of it. I love this moment when the deities are giving the little blue-flame toy back to little Sanjay. You'd always talked about how this was a moment where they were saying to him, "You can have both cultures. "You can have this culture, but you can also enjoy this American culture." This little moment always gets a laugh. When the little boy is finally engaging with this world of the deities... We pull the rug out and they disappear and he's left with these dead statues. This is another important moment, symbolically. Yeah, it felt like that moment was all about the father feeling like, "That's it, my tradition ends here, "my son is not interested in what my culture represents." We really wanted to show that by him actually physically putting out that candle. And, it's a perfect contrast to when little Sanjay opens those blinds, too, because again, on that theme of light, he's bringing the light into that larger room and bringing him and his father together and shows that "I have heard what you're saying, I understand it, "and in my way, I'm going to preserve this culture." Yeah, they finally meet in the middle. That was really important, thematically, for me. And there we are! There's that photo of me and my dad. John Lasseter thought it was really important to say this was your personal story, so it was Sanjay's Super Team. I really wanted this notion of team. I never wanted it to be superheroes. My father and me were a team, and it really reflected my experience working here at Pixar over the years. There's so many talented people who work together. It is what I think is truly brilliant about the films, that teamwork. We put out a call to the folks who were working on the film and asked if their kids wanted to do drawings. And they brought these great drawings in. And that was really important to me, because this whole short is very much about a kid's imagination.
