[MUSIC PLAYING] DANIEL (VOICEOVER): Once upon a time, 1/2 to 2/3 of all marriages in America ended in divorce. 20 years ago, my parents did the dirty deed. They ended their marriage. Dad took me, the baby boy. Mom took my three older sisters. My three sisters. I couldn't have told you a single thing about them. It's funny how you don't think about them much. But Dad and I moved around a lot. And slowly, we lost touch. The year my parents got divorced, we lost something. And that's what can happen. We weren't part of each other's lives. And 20 years passes until you suddenly realize you lost something. We all lost something. [BUZZING] Shut up. Come here. [INAUDIBLE] I'm going to get you. DEBORAH: OK. That's it. Breakfast over. We're done with this. We're done with this. Drink your juice. Both of you, drink your juice. [INAUDIBLE] In the car right now. Let's go. Tommy, up. Out. Move it. DANIEL (VOICEOVER): Once up a time, 1/2 to 2/3 of all marriages in America ended in divorce. This is my story. It's the story of my family. Tommy, in the house. Come on. TOMMY: Tracy, you are such a stupid cow. Tommy. Hey. Tommy, shut up. How come you always have to yell at me. Tracy started it. Why I yell at you? Because I'm your mother, that's why. It's my job. Oh, Mom. Thanks. And your sister's not a stupid cow, so you lay off, brainiac. God. Admit it, Ma. We were never this hard. It's boys. That little extra boy thing they got. Uh, no sweets. None. ANN: I can't get over it. He looks just like your brother did. [SIGH]. What? Hm. Are you feeling OK? Yeah, sure. I don't have to get the bus to the first stop till 8:00. So go. Go to work. I'll make sure he gets off with the rest of your sister's troop. Tommy. Come here, give me a kiss. I gotta go. TOMMY: I got to go to a bathroom. DEBORAH: Give me a kiss. You love your mother. You know you do. TOMMY: Yeah, right. Yeah, you better run. Creep. Bye, Ma. Thanks. Bye, sweetheart. Listen to your Grammy Ann, right? Yep. Bye. Thanks. Thanks. -Want a cookie? -Yeah. -Yeah? What kind? Um, chocolate. No. Oatmeal. LEAH: So finished your papers last night? Why are you making this such a big deal? Because you proposed to me, and then I have to put together my wedding all by myself. Hey, what do you need? Well, thank you cards. They're so floral. My mom picked them out. Your mom would like these. Actually, that's a very traditional pattern. What? It's just, couldn't we do plain white cards? Sure. Why don't we just slap a stamp on an index card, drop it in the mailbox? No, that's not what I'm saying. Look, I got to get to class. You know, I could use just a little bit of help from you. It looks like a zoo for little humans out there. Yeah. God, I love autumn. The trees are so beautiful. Hey, where you going with that? And where are you going? I got to pick up the 9 o'clock. Tommy's inside. I think he's doing something awful to your cat. Tommy, get out here. So you just going to leave me with these kids? Honey, I put in my time already. Yeah. But you had three girls. And girls are easy. Grandchildren, the sweetest of a mother's revenge. Ha-ha. You think you're so funny. Oh, Mom? Can you pick up-- Ma? Ma, where'd you go? Ma. Where'd you go? Ma. Ma! Ma! Hey, cut it. Cut it off. Thank you. You got Deb. Sorry. Oh, Donna. What's up? What? Oh my god. When? Where are you? All right. Just us monkeys. It's perfect. Ah. [MONKEY SOUNDS]. Daniel. DEBORAH: Excuse me, where do you put-- Who are you looking for? I'm looking for my mother. I've been filling out paperwork for the last hour. They put her down there. -Oh. Thanks a lot, Grandma. Thanks for your help. Mom. You OK? ANN: I'm fine. -How are you doing? ANN: I'm fine. I'm fine. Ma. Doctor, these are my daughters. -Her doctor? -Finally. Is she OK? I think she's going to be fine. What do you mean, you think? Aren't you supposed to know about these things? I'm sorry, doctor. They get like this when their nerves set in. Well, of course the nerves set in, Ma. You're dying here or something. I'm not dying. I'm fine. Nothing is wrong. And I lied, they're always like this. Ma, we got TVs. We know when you have plastic tubes running in and out of you, you're really sick. Doctor, can you please tell us what happened? DOCTOR: Your mother had a mild heart attack. Oh my god. I knew it. DEBORAH: Mild? -I knew it. DEBORAH: What the hell is a mild-- Ma, what the hell is the matter with you? Why didn't you take it easy? -Deb. [INTERPOSING VOICES] Shut up. Sorry, Ma. Ladies, I think you're going to have to leave. Who are you? I'm the holy word of God sent down here to keep your mother alive by telling you to get out. You don't friggen talk to my sister like that. ANN: Donna? Why don't you look after my garden? Ma, I'll take care of your garden for you. ANN: Oh, good. Donna, especially my mums. All right. I'm going to go. Let them do whatever they-- No, Deb. Wait. Just-- What? This is my room. NURSE: Two minutes. Thank you, Sargent [INAUDIBLE]. Does that hurt? Stupid. What is it? I got really scared. And I started to think about-- About what? About your brother. Well, Ma. He's gone. I want you to find him. What the frig you talking about? I need to know. You need to know what? That he's an [INAUDIBLE] like my father? Or that he turned out like all the other low-life deadbeats around here who can't get a job to save their lives? I just need to know. I need to know, is he healthy? Is he happy? Where do you want me to look for him? What am I supposed to do? No, it's not just you. Your sisters will help, too. DEBORAH: Oh, yeah. Thank god. The only two adult women who still cheat at Concentration. I got this out of the newspaper. It's a-- it's an article about computers. And it mentions your father. It seems he did pretty good for himself. Just bought some big house near to where your brother goes to school. Danny is at Harvard. Harvard? Danny is at Harvard? So you want me to go to Harvard to find my brother, Daniel, who I don't know? And maybe, perhaps, the father who abandoned me 20 years ago. And say, oh, hi. Uh, where's my brother? Is he healthy? Is he happy? Is he alive? Deborah, can you just do this for me? Ma. Christ. -Thank you. I got to go before the glamorous nurse of wrestling comes in and busts my chops. Thank you. All right. Don't let Diane near my mums. [SIGH] Oh. I see Bill's doing well with this new entrepreneurial thing. Deb, lay off. Look, he's like the next Bill Gates sitting out there. Deb, shut up. All he needs now is his GED. DONNA: Enough. Hey. Hey. How'd it go? Fine. She OK? No news since I called. Where's the kids? Oh, they're out back playing with the slip and slide. Don't you think it's a little cold to be playing with-- what slip and slide? Bill. The kids don't have a slip and slide. Yeah, I know. But they were a little bored, so I figured I'd hook them up with a-- You should be thinking money. BILL: Well, you know, then divorce me. What'd you say? Nothing. No, you didn't. Listen, I am not having this conversation. Listen. DONNA: Don't. Listen, I'm sorry. [INAUDIBLE]. How's your Ma? She's, uh-- I can't talk to you right now. What? Hey, champ. Listen, Rup. Your father and I-- -Hey, Rup. - --we were just, uh-- -Go ahead. Go play with your brothers. Go ahead. -Don't fight. -No. No, we're not fighting. We're just talking. Go play with your brothers. Come on. -Come here. -Come on. Go out back that way. Play with your brothers. Go ahead. Yeah. I'm really sorry. Me too. BOY: Get away. Get away from me. -What are you doing? Rupert, come on. Hey, hey, hey. Cut it out, guys. Come on. What are you doing? Are you OK? What's the matter? Look, all we have to do is find the housing office. Right? And find out where he lives. And what are we going to do when we find him? We won't have to do anything. When he sees us, he'll probably start crying. Then, we'll all start crying. Isn't this exciting? How's my makeup? What are you? This is not daytime TV. -Deb. Montel Williams is daytime. Martha Stewart's daytime. Will you please stop chomping your gum? This is a frigging academic office. Shut up. You shut up. If there's one place that she has been other than a bedroom enough times, it's an academic office. Please don't talk about "moy" when I'm in the room like "moy" is not in the room, all right? It's wicked irritating. "Moy?" It's French for "me." You're right. Leave. Leave. Fine. [INAUDIBLE] Hello. Hello. There she is. Can I help you ladies with something? We're hoping that you can. We just flew in. Yeah, from Europe. DEBORAH: Yeah. To greet our brother here. -Yeah. And we were hoping you cold help us find him. -Now, what's his name? -Oh. Daniel, um, Simpson. Yeah, Thomas. DEBORAH: Thomas. Right. Thomas Simpson. -No. What are you saying? No, it's Daniel Simpson Thomas. -Do any of you have any gum? I'm bored. I need something to occupy my brain. In the car! She's not with us. Maybe we should just call the whole thing off, you know? What? [INAUDIBLE], think of Ma. She's right. I don't know about this. We show up at this [INAUDIBLE] fancy, dancy school. Find this brother we haven't seen in 20 years. What? We're going to barge in, go, hey, little bro. How you doing? We're back. And, uh-- so what do you think of Wagner's first movement in the ride of the [INAUDIBLE] something? That's Wagner's "Ride of the [INAUDIBLE]." It's the one that Elmer Fudd sings with Bugs Bunny. It's my favorite one. He's wearing the little horns and he goes kill the rabbit. Kill the rabbit. I love that one. This is exactly my point. DONNA: What? -I mean, look at us. -What? This is not good, old Saugus, MA, all right? This is Harvard. I couldn't even explain to you what it is they talk about here. Maybe she's right. Maybe we should just go home. Yeah. I mean, I don't know. We could-- we could tell Ma, you know, we couldn't find him, or something. No. We said we're going to find him. We're going to find him. PROFESSOR: So if you can please, finish the six chapters that I've listed on the board. Lecture hall. And we will start on them at the beginning of next class. Can I help you ladies? -Yeah. We're looking for a business class. PROFESSOR: Well, this is-- No, actually. We're, uh-- we're looking for home ec. Is this a home ec? -What? PROFESSOR: This is actually an economics. [INAUDIBLE]. Hey, this is Harvard. This is not high school. I know. Actually, I'm not-- uh, we're not looking for home economics. We're looking for our brother. PROFESSOR: Your brother? And who might that be? Daniel Thomas. I happen to be looking for him, too. Really? Wow. What a coinkydink. Hey. [INAUDIBLE]. PROFESSOR: -[INAUDIBLE]. My punctual assistant. Too bad you can't be as functional as the rest of your family. I'm sorry, Professor Oxnard. I just-- family? Yes. Surely you recognize our guest today. Diane Simpson, your sister. Hi, Danny. My sister? And the rest of your family. What happened to his hair? Oh my. Danny? Hey, Donna. Check this out. Look, he's got pictures. Some of his friends. Oh, yeah. DONNA: Maybe we should go check on him. No, I think we've done enough already. We're not going to go breaking into his bathroom. I'm sorry. You all just took me by surprise. Don't worry about it. We're real sorry, too. DIANE: Yeah. [INAUDIBLE]. And we're going to get out of your hair. So nice to have at least met you. And let's go. -Wait. Wait, wait, wait. You're joking? My three sisters who I haven't seen since I was a baby show up at my class, knock me out cold, and before I can say anything, you're just going to walk out of my life again? Yeah. No. Well, we didn't think you'd even remember us. To be honest, I don't really. But now that I found you, I'm not going to let you disappear again. Hey, maybe you could come over and see Dad tonight. I mean, there's just so much to talk about. Oh, Danny. We'd be psyched. Of course. DEBORAH: Our father, huh? Come on, Deb. Don't spoil it. DIANE: Of course. OK. Ma. You're going to be so happy. -Hey, Deb. -Hey. Sorry. I didn't mean to wake you. You should sleep. ANN: It's the damn hospital food. It gives me gas and knocks me out. Ooh. Excuse me. Ma. These are from Tracy. "I love you, Grammy Ann." So what's with all of the machines in here? This what they call "mild?" You know doctors. They'd hook me up to a Nintendo if they could. Yeah. Got some good news for you. That's good, sweetheart. I'm just-- I'm so tired. Did you see your father? I had your sister bring that in for me. [SIGH]. Yeah. Ma. OK. You sleep. Louise. LEE: Hey, is that my Harvard-educated son out there? Hey, Pa. LEE: Hold on, Danny. I got to get a drink. Louise, I think it's going to be five. Would they bring their husbands? -They could. DIANE: Wow. DONNA: I can't believe this. What a-- Hey, Pa. LEE: This is a nice surprise. What are you doing home? Uh, actually, Dad. I came home for a special reason. And what may that be? Oh, by the way, did you speak to Leah about having my company pay for the wedding? Then, I could invite some associates and write it off as a business expense. Dad. That's-- It's a joke. I know how women get around weddings. Same as men at divorces. DANIEL: Dad. I met my three sisters at school today. They're coming for dinner. They'll be here in an hour. [DOORBELL RINGING] They're early. Louise, I'll get it. What do you mean, you met your sisters at school? Sisters? Your sisters? A flock of women in habits. Please, let it be a flock of women in habits outside. [DOORBELL RINGING] I'm sorry, Dad. But there was no time to warn you about this. LEE: They're coming in here now? I don't know what to say to them. Find something to say. I can't believe you would do this. You found it. Come on in. Louise. May I take your coats? Be careful. This is real rabbit fur. It's shedding a little. Daniel, hors d'oeuvres will be served in a few minutes in the living room. -Thanks, Louise. Louise, this is Donna, Deb, and Diane. I'm so pleased to meet you. My sisters. Do you dress like this all the time? Yes. Most of the time, meals are formal. Sorry. Um, well, thank you. This way. Donna. Deb. Diane. Your father. Hi. How are you? Nice to meet you. Oh, Donna. Look. Doesn't this look like of Rup's. Yeah. It's really nice. Dad. Thank you. Donna, you're drooling. DANIEL: Uh, please. Please sit. Sit. Sit. So how you doing, Lee? Good. So how's your mother? OK. She had an accident, but she'll be fine. I didn't know. I'm sorry. Nothing serious though? Oh, no. Um, just too much stress from the kids on the bus. -She still drives the bus? -Oh, yeah. She just loves driving that bus with the kids. She likes working with kids, huh? She wanted to be a teacher. Yeah, she just got sidetracked. Yeah. Well, you know, life. Oh, life. Listen. Just because you have the ability to drop three kids and a wife and go on your own merry way with one that you hold hostage. I am not going to have this conversation. [SIGH]. You're right. You're not. I'm sorry. [INAUDIBLE]. LEE: How dare you-- Dad. We will talk later. Here. Sorry. She OK? She's fine. Just needs to breathe. -We're really sorry. -Oh. You guys have nothing to apologize for. I didn't exactly think before I invited you all over for dinner. But you know, Dad really isn't a bad guy. Hey, don't worry about it. I've been waiting 20 years to get that off my chest. So woo, got it out. It's done. Let's go. Grab him. Oh, no, no, no. I can't. I got to be up early. No, excuse me. I can't. So, uh, where are we going? You'll see. So Harvard. So how'd you end up there? I mean, I know you're wicked smart. I could tell that. I mean, even if you-- even if you didn't go to Harvard. Did you ever see the "Rocky Horror Picture Show?" That was the last time that I was at Harvard before. Rocko [INAUDIBLE] brought me. And I was thinking the whole time, wasn't it wicked funny? Rocko [INAUDIBLE] brought me to see the "Rocky Horror Picture Show." Do you get that? Rocko. Rocky. Yeah. So where are we going? The other side of the tracks. Someplace you haven't been in 20 years. The other side of the tracks. Woo. The other side. The other side. The other side. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Side of the tracks. The other side of the track. DIANE: [INAUDIBLE]. Come on. Well, I can't be out late because my fiancee will kill me if I miss breakfast the minister tomorrow. DIANE: Fiancee? DONNA: Fiancee? Oh, yeah. [INAUDIBLE] A wedding! Who is she? She's just the woman-- the woman I love. [INTERPOSING VOICES] [MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, Paul. How are you? Oh, how you doing? This is our little bro. It's our brother. He's getting married. Drink. [INAUDIBLE]. This is Saugus. Saugus shot glass [INAUDIBLE]. [INTERPOSING VOICES] DIANE: Don't ask questions, just drink it. Like the Harvard man you are. Drink, drink, drink, drink. Woo. Libations. I haven't been here in so long. I guess this is familiar territory to you guys, huh? Are you kidding me? We used to come here every Saturday night. Oh, we'd dress up. We were the Singing D's. I was lead. Yeah. your dad used to bring us here when we were really young to bowl. Dad used to bowl? Oh, yeah. All the time. Dad used to bowl? And after you guys left, um, we kind of became the mascots of the place. -Yeah. Everyone felt sorry for the poor, little orphan girls. So if you were an animal, what kind of animal would you be? Excuse me? What are you asking? I'm just wondering what kind of animal he'd be. It was a test in one of my magazines. Psychologists give it all the time. I don't know. A dog, I guess? Why? Because they're friendly and trainable. I don't know, what would you be? -A duck. -A duck? Uh-huh. -Why? -Two reasons. One, they mate for life. -They do? -Yeah. -I thought that was swans? It is? -I think so. -Oh. Thought it was a duck. What's your other reason? They look good in and out of the water. I'm [INAUDIBLE]. I'm dancing. Come on. Let's go dance. Come on. Go. Go, go.

Daniel, this is Rupert, Robert, Richard, and Roger. Say hi, guys. Hello. Oh my god, it's either the Lilliputian army or-- What are you looking for? The Wicked Witch [INAUDIBLE]. [SCREAMING] Wrong answer, I guess. Ooh. When are you going to take me to the zoo? -The zoo? -Mm-hmm. That's what uncles do. Oh, of course. -Rupert. -Rupert. But not until Uncle Dan gets some breakfast and cleans up. And dries out? DONNA: Come on, sweetheart. Come on, kiddos. Single file. Up you go. Oh, Uncle Dan, bathroom's down at the end of the hall. Thanks. No, I'll you the bacon when it's done. You can have all of it. -Ooh. -No, no. watch the stove. Not in here. Breakfast in the, uh, family room today. [INAUDIBLE] good. Bye, guys. So you're awake. Is that what you call it? DONNA: You want some coffee? Yeah, I'd love some. Hi. So where's my breakfast? Do I look like your mother? BILL: Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Don't insult my mother. Go in the other room and watch some cartoons like the good, little boy you are until you are called. Please, Bill. Just go in the other room. This is my castle, not Morticia's. Oh, fine. Daniel. This is your brother-in-law, Bill Sullivan, BS for short. Bill. Nice to meet you, bro. Nice to meet you. So do you all live here? -Oh, yeah. -No. Just me and Bill and the kids and Ma.

That's your spawn. Your spawn. So about your bride. DONNA: How many kids she have? DIANE: What kind of question is that? I was joking. But you know, a lot of women have children before marriage. Not at Harvard, they don't. No. No, it's a fine question. But, uh, no, she doesn't. Um, her name is Leah Bloodwirth and she's getting her master's in French literature. And she's, uh, special. She's a virgin. DANIEL: What? You shut your mouth. DONNA: No, no. It's great if she is. I am. Oh, right. And look, there's blood coming from her palms. Shut up. Shut up. Believe it or not, I think you might have been at one time. So when do we get to meet her? I was supposed to meet her for-- Oh, look. Uh, just cool your jets, sweetheart. Everything's under control. Look, it's early. I'll go just change my face and I'll drop you off. No, wait. What about seeing Mom? -Oh, yeah. -Can do that later. Don't worry about it. -Yep. Do that later. Uncle Daniel, I think I found the Wicked Witch's shoes. -I'll get you, my pretty. -Ah. Good one, Rup. [KNOCKING] Morning, Ms. Simpson. How we doing today? I don't know about you, doctor. I feel like I got a car parked on my chest. Think we'll get another EKG on you. Take some more pictures. You don't need to move, we'll bring it right up to you. So I'm going to be OK? DOCTOR: You're going to be fine. Let's get one thing straight. My daughter, Donna, has all the paperwork. I don't want to die hooked up to all your gizmos. You got it? DOCTOR: I got it. Good. Have a nice day, doctor. Hi, honey. I'm sorry I'm late. I'm sorry I didn't call. I went out with the gang last night. You did? What'd you do? Usual guy stuff. Usual guy stuff. Um, what usual guys went? The usual guys. Steve. Wow, you guys must have been out late. Because Steve was at the library until 1:00 when I left him falling asleep in his book. But then again, I thought you were talking about Steve, your roommate. You must have been talking about Steve, the blonde bimbo that just dropped you off. Leah, it's not what you think. I can't believe you. Will you let me explain? Fine. Go ahead. She's my sister. [SCOFF]. Good one, Dan. You must really think I'm stupid. Will you calm down? Lee. Lee. Tramp. Who told you? Did my brother tell you? You could have at least let her meet me first. Brother? Who's your brother? This stud, of course. Didn't you notice we have the same neck? Daniel. [SIGH] I am-- I'm so sorry. Leah. I know. Diane. Hi. Hi. You'll have to excuse my reaction, I'm a bit confused Aren't we all? Oh, I wanted to remind you. Sunday, 10:00 AM. I don't think I was going to forget. -Can I drop you off somewhere? -Sure. If it's on your way. Great. I can fill you in on all the bits. Sis. So you didn't know Daniel had sisters? Oh, of course I did. I just didn't remember him telling me that you were going to be visiting, that's all. Thanks. So I'll see you at the shower. Yeah. And tell Deb and Donna that I look forward to meeting them. I am so excited. A real frigging wedding. You haven't had a wedding till you had one with our family. Donna can do some real nice stuff with a Styrofoam cup and latex. Nice centerpieces. -Oh. Well, that stuff is pretty much taken care of. Well, we'll think of something else to do. Yeah. Um, just show up. That'll bring something in and of itself. OK. Sis. Shower. Bye. -Thanks. I can't believe you didn't tell me you had sisters. I haven't seen them for 20 years. I don't know them any better than the strangers on the street. Dad had me believing that they didn't even want me back in their lives. But they are still your sisters. And she, obviously, wants to be back in. What about your mother? My mother's in the hospital. She had a heart attack. -Oh, Dan. I am so sorry. My ma left me when I was six. I don't know her. I told them I'd go see her on Sunday. Thank you for inviting them to the shower. I didn't even think of that. And I'm so glad that you're not worried about what your mother's going to think because she's just going to have to deal. Come on, we're late. Oh, yeah. That's Leah right there. DONNA: Is everyone staring at us, or is it my imagination? Not at us, ladies. Just me. Hey, Leah. We're here. So you are. Uh, everyone, these are my long-lost soon-to-be sisters-in-law. We're under-dressed. -Hi. -Here. Here. Thanks. Thank you. -I'm Donna. Come in. -Deb. -Hi. Sisters. LEAH: Come on in. OK. Hi. Hello, ladies. I'm Joanne, mother of the bride. Yeah. Leah's Ma. DIANE: Charmed. -Me, too. Um, so quite a, uh, fascinating story. Well, Leah told me all about the, uh, separation. Children of divorce. It's so sad. Oh, have you met Leah's sister, Sophie? Sophie-- -Hello. -Hi. Hi. It must have been horrible for you not having a father. What are you kidding? What? Our Ma did a great job. Well, it must have been so hard for her. Well, there are so many of you. I think one or two kids is best. Don't go there. Excuse me? Nothing. Nothing. Would you excuse me, girls? One moment. [INAUDIBLE] Well, at least we know better in our day, right, girls? I mean, none of you are Catholic, right? Large families just result in someone growing up and feeling neglected. Well, actually, I have four boys. And I'm really glad. But you know, I heard it's worse to have two girls because the youngest usually ends up just like her mother. You know, frigid and pompous. Oh. How are you? I'm fine. Thank you. How are you? -This is Caroline. She was able to come. -Hi. I'm Andrea. Is it me? Oh, no. No. Quite a crowd. Three buds, hold the glasses. Think those were real diamonds? Of course. Yeah? Thank you. OK, this one is from Aunt Esther. Oh. It's-- That's nice. It's beautiful. Thank you. You remember that? JOANNE: Yes. Pass it around. And this is from me. LEAH: Thank you. Did you get a chance to look at Diane's gift? -No, I thought you were gonna. -Uh-oh. You know, I have a real talent to buy the practical gift that no one ever wants to buy. OK, open it. Open it. Open it. -OK. DIANE: It's just your color. Oh my. DIANE: You know, it's for those cold nights when the husband's motor just won't turnover. Look, the batteries are included. What is it? I think it's something for a car emergency, dear. Pass it around. No, no, no. Um, it's private. [DOORBELL RINGING] Everyone, sit down. I'll get it. There's one more gift. There is? DEBORAH: What? Everyone. Karen and Miles, come on in. JOANNE: Karen and Miles who? [SCREAMING]. Strippers. JOANNE: Strippers. Let it rip, boys. Whoopie. JOANNE: Sofie, get them out of here. [CHEERS] I'm sorry, Joanne. Yeah, I-- I understand your dismay. I know. I love her like a daughter myself. No, I will speak to Daniel. But they are grown. And they are getting married. And we can't make their decisions for them. Oh, excuse me. Where are you going? Big day, Dad. I'm going to see my mother. Wait, Daniel. I need-- [DOOR OPENING] Joanne, I have to go. [DOOR CLOSING] Well, extend my sympathies to Aunt Esther. Strippers? [DOORBELL RINGING] It's OK, Louise. I've got it. I'm here to pick up, Daniel. Would you get him, please? Uh. I think that Donna just picked him up. I told-- like an hour drive for nothing. Deborah. What? -I just want to-- -Hey. Hey. I told you guys to stay in the car. TOMMY: Sorry, Ma. In the car now. OK. DEBORAH: Now. Ma? That's right. So you're married? No. Their father's just like mine. He took off. Deb, I am sorry. I don't want to hear it. You left my mother with three kids. My sisters never got a father. Donna, I don't know how she turned out as good as she did. She used to be afraid. So afraid of everything. And Diane. After you left, we had to fight to keep Diane in school. She used to lie and tell everybody that her father got killed in the Revolutionary War. I'm sorry. Sometimes, people have to leave. Don't give me that. While you weren't there helping my mother, she had to fight to raise three children by herself. Working dingy job after dingy job. I see you've got your mother's temper. Don't you dare speak to me like that. If your mother had any sense at all, she wouldn't be driving a bus. If she wasn't so better, could have achieved just as much as I did. Yeah. You're right. Had she had a penis. But you forget, my mother didn't have the opportunities to learn in those wonderful "father knows best" days. But she's achieved 100 times more than you or any other 60-year-old guy you show me today. I got to go. But you know what they say, sometimes people just have to leave. Don't they? Ma. Hey. Ma. We brought you something. Hi. I think we've met. Oh my god. DONNA: He goes to Harvard. DIANE: And he's getting married. Oh my god. It's just like Oprah. Come on. We really should have been more forceful [INAUDIBLE]. I don't know who to believe. Dad says he tried to make it work. And my sisters say he abandoned them. Well, what did your mother say? She doesn't say anything. She doesn't look good. -Well, she's sick. -Yeah. But I didn't expect her to look that sick. She's in the hospital, Dan. Actually, Dad's story-- I don't know. You know, you don't have to choose between your father and your sisters. Yeah. But I-- but they can't both be right. I don't know. I feel like I'm being split in two. I don't know anything that happened. Their whole divorce is a complete mystery to me. I mean, what went wrong? I don't know. No one person stops loving. It just I think stops itself. Hey, we should head back. I didn't give them directions to the rehearsal. Your sisters are coming to the rehearsal? Well, of course. But Dan, after the whole bridal shower thing. I mean, as it is, my mother doesn't want them at the wedding. Your mother? Why are we always talking about what your mother wants? They should be bridesmaids or something. Bridesmaids? What will they wear? Leah. OK. OK. My mother's going to kill me. Listen, just have them meet me beforehand at least. Otherwise, they may not get in the door. OK. And let Diane know that I think there's something in the Bible against wearing animal skin prints to a wedding ceremony. I will. I can't believe you're bonding with my sisters. Yeah. Hey. I'll race you back. -Cheater. What do you think about this one? Too much leather. DONNA: Oh, no. I like it. That would be perfect for a christening, but not a formal dinner. Maybe she's right. You're right. Oh. DONNA: Ugh. Oh, please. Spare us. Are you all right? Yeah. I'll be fine. Why? How about you? DONNA: Boring. I just hate when you get families together. My god. If your dad-- I mean, your biological father talks to you, just bite down on something. -Yeah. Like Sofie's face. Be my guest. Look, I'm telling you something, your whole family, when I'm around them, I feel like a crow that landed in a peacock cage. I tun a whole office, for Christ sake. Here. I mean, you're not like that. OK? I just wanted to tell you, just so you know. Yeah, I agree. You're really nice. Thanks. You guys make me feel like part of your family. What'd you think, our brother would marry a stuck-up floozy? DONNA: No. It's-- well, it's just that her family is stuck up. And her schooling is stuck up, so you just think she would be-- but you're not. Well, thanks, I guess. But if you think about it, your brother grew up the same way I did. Yeah, but he's blood related. And ladies, you can take the boy away from the dog, but you cannot take the dog away from the boy. Wine's really good, though. You nut. Dad. LEE: What is it, Dan? This damn tie. I can't get a straight knot. -So are your sisters coming? -Yeah. Leah is with them now. They're getting ready. Deborah? Think so. And how's your mother? Do you really want to know? Of course, I want to know. She's not well. What does that mean? Well, they have a bunch of machines hooked up to her. And she looks-- She looks what? Spit it out. She looks sick. Really sick. I thought she had a mild attack? That's what the three of them told me. That's what I think they want to believe. And you're not saying that you think she's going to-- I'm just saying she's really sick. She's a strong woman. You shouldn't even be thinking like that. Pa. Tell me why you and she divorced. Danny, you know this story. I've told you so many times you could tell it in your sleep. Yeah, I know. Do you know that every time you tell the story, you use the same words, the same sentences, the same mistakes. Every time. Your mother and I had irreconcilable differences. Is that what you said when you asked her for a divorce, we have irreconcilable differences? No, I didn't ask for the divorce. She did. I didn't leave that marriage. Or maybe I did. I don't know. Why are we talking about this now? -Was it because of me? -No. We were high school sweethearts. Getting married was the happiest thing I had ever done. But life gets complicated. We had four children. Two jobs apiece. Somehow, we lost the connection we had. It seemed pointless to go on. Why didn't you ever contact your daughters? Your mother didn't want me to have anything to do with them after we left. She was very angry. And she ran interference very well. When we went to Texas, I didn't contact her for a while because I was all wrapped up in the business. But in the end, when I started making money, I sent them checks. I tried to visit them. Your mother had a fit. She thought I was trying to buy her daughters off of her. She took out a restraining order on me, if you can believe that. I didn't want to get into a fight with her over our girls. So I just gave up. So you were the one that ended the marriage? No, I've told you a thousand times, I didn't ask for the divorce. But you were the one who left? Yes. But I didn't end the marriage. I don't know. Why are we talking about this? I'm sorry. Go get ready. All I need is for Joanne to be angry at me because we're late. So we've rehearsed everything at the church and we're all set for tomorrow. We've figured out who are the lucky parents who are getting rid of the bride and groom. Now is the scary part. The promise. One of love, and trust, and commitment. So this is the time when I ask the couple to run. No, I'm just kidding. But this is the last time that I can tell you of the solemnity of these vows. When two people have found that they know that it's going to last the rest of their lives, it is their duty, no matter how old-fashioned it might sound, for them to acknowledge before the world their devotion. And to recognize in this union, the gentle touch of God. Down the road, should that touch feel more like a slap, you can come back to this very same place where you are today and God will help remind you of what you have. Yeah, Ma. Yeah, everyone's here. I think the ceremony is going to be very nice. Yeah, we're going to video it for you. Right. OK. Get some sleep. Me, too. So what's up my my new/old Pop? Hello, Diane. How you doing? A little drunk. I asked you first. I'm fine. You know, that minister was right. I hope they were listening. Oh, yeah? About what? That when things get rough, you better go back to the place where you started because if you don't, you may make some big mistakes that could hurt for a long time. Oh. Is that what you think he was saying? I thought he was saying after, to remind you to go back to that place so you can resolve those mistakes. I didn't want to leave you. Well, I was pretty young when you left and I'm not a grudge holder. I just figure, you're my dad. You left. I don't know why. But you know, I don't make judgments. I just-- I hope that someday you'll tell me what happened. But right now, you know, I got my dad and my brother, so I figure-- you know, might as well enjoy it. So you can tell me about what happened, and then I'll make a judgment. -You're very smart. -Me? You really think so? Yes, I do. Very. Thank you. I watch a lot of daytime programming. So what are you two talking about? Nothing. I'll explain it to you later. [APPLAUSE] Hey, guys. How about a song? DIANE: No. -Come on. Seriously. WOMAN: Come on, ladies. Seriously. Come on. OK. This is a song that Ma used to do with us. (SINGING) Rose, rose, rose, rose. Will I ever see thee wed? I will marry at thy will, sire. [INTERPOSING VOICES] I will marry at thy will, sire. At thy will. [APPLAUSE] That was so good. They should sing at the wedding. -No. Uh, no, they can't sing at the wedding. Why not? Well, um-- Because Daniel, they weren't planned for the wedding. And we can't change that? Dan, chill out. No, I won't chill out. DEBORAH: Dan. Forget it. We would just embarrass him, like when we was kids. Good grief. Shut up! Daniel. Don't talk to my mother that way. Well, you know what? Someone has to because you're always like, yes, Mother. Yes, Mother. Yes, Mother. Daniel, what's wrong with you? I've had enough. Well, Lee. I can see you're in no condition to deal with your son. Joanne, you are such a bitch. Henry. Well, I guess you've all done enough damage. I'll be taking my daughter home now. Wait for Sophie and me to get our bags. No, I think the two of you can hail a cab. What? In the suburbs at 11:00 PM? There won't be any cabs. Well then, the walk home might do you some good. Cool you down. Or warm you up as the case may be. Um, what just happened? MAN: I don't know. I'm sorry, you know that? We know that. I caught on the third time you said that. If there's anything you want, it's yours. -I want you to go to bed. -Here. Take this. -Thanks. OK. Come on. Oh. I'll talk to Joanne about you two singing at the wedding. OK, Lee. But somehow, I don't think you need to worry about that right now. There you go. OK. I mean, just look at you now. You come into my life for a couple of days and look what your father does. Your sister's right. I can't even take care of myself. Oh, I had your brother, but boys are easy. It's an amazing feat what your mother did with you three. OK, Dad. You need to get some sleep. -Up you go. Sleep? I want to spend time with my daughters. Sure. LEE: You know, I tried to see you, but your mother wouldn't let me see you. Just get some sleep, Dad. LEE: I tried. DIANE: What's that? These are pictures of us. And letters. Unopened. ANN: Hey. -Hi, Mom. What is my son doing here? I'm sorry. I didn't want to disturb you. ANN: How'd you get in here? Nurse at the station fell asleep. I think she's watching "Letterman." His monologues have been just so weak lately. I turn him on and they can skip my medication. Poor guy. He's gone from being a national icon to a national sleeping pill. I like Mr. Leno, though. The Boston boy, you know? I saw him once down on old Route 1. Are those tears? No. What's the matter with my son? I'm confused. You're gay? No. No. Well, what are you confused about? I guess we-- we threw you kind of a curve showing up on your doorstep. Don't blame your sisters. They were only doing it for me. That's not it. It's probably the best thing. Well, what is it? I'm confused about this marriage. Leah's family, dad, my sisters. If I'm doing the wrong thing, what the right thing is. ANN: OK, slow down. Just slow down. And breathe. You love her? -Yes. But it's not that simple. Oh, Daniel. It is that simple. Marriage is about the two people involved. Is it because of her family or your family that you fell in love? No. Then, we're not in it. If you love her, no one can stop that love. I'm sorry for dropping all this on you. I haven't been around for 20 years and now you're in the hospital. And here I am with all my problems. I was not around for 20 years. I wasn't there. You don't remember me. You don't know anything about me. But I never did and I never will stop being your mother. Breathe. Breathe. Hey. You're home, huh? It's about time. I can't take these brats of yours for another minute. What? What are you looking at? Huh? I love you. I love you, too. Are you doing OK? -Yeah. Good morning. Good morning. You slept just like a baby. Yeah. Yeah, I did. ANN: Do m favor. Go get some fresh air for me. So anyway, I'm going to be at Harvard. I'll be going out with like a fraternity guy [INAUDIBLE]. And I'll be like Mrs. Harvard. I totally will be. Can you see that, Deb? No, I can't. Where's the love? I could totally be that. NURSE: Hey, ladies. Good morning. How are you three this morning? Oh my god. Look at the [INAUDIBLE]. What a great makeover. Of course. I go, girl. Oh. So how's Ma doing? -She had a visitor last night. -Oh. -Hey, stowaway. -We just let him sleep. How'd you end up here? I snuck in last night. I'm sorry about leaving you three there. I hope I didn't embarrass you. No, no. We need to apologize. DIANE: Yeah. We're really wicked sorry, Danny. We didn't mean to invade your life and just turn you upside down. You have not done anything wrong. Well, your life was already set up. I mean, we didn't mean to rob you of that. I was robbed of you three. And I'm not going to let Joanne push you out. Leah needs to understand that. She does, Daniel. So, um, Mom awake? Yeah, I think so. Psst. Ma. Your whole wonderful family is here. Ma? Ma. -Ma. No, Ma. No, Ma. Ma, no. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on, Mom. Don't do this to me. Come on. Don't do this to me. I'm not ready yet. No. Ma, come on. You can't go. Mom, no. No, Ma. Grammy Ann is dead. I know, little one. That mean we won't talk to her or see her for a long time? Nope. We won't. That's a nice suit you have on. Does that mean she's not our grandmother anymore? DANIEL: No. Listen, I want you to know this. Because I probably know it better than anyone. No matter where you go, she will always, always be your grandma. Rup, honey. Come wash your hands. [INAUDIBLE], Rup. [INAUDIBLE] That was so nice. Yeah. I don't think the minister could have done a better job. Yeah. Me neither. You should do commercials for the phone company, or something. What? What? He should. I hate you guys. You doing OK? OK. Careful, honey. It's hot in here. DIANE: Here's the meat platter you said that you wanted. What time did he say he was going to get here? He didn't. But I think he was wary of the whole thing. You think we did the right thing? Right thing? I'm not sure there is such a thing. But I hope it wasn't the wrong thing. Yeah. Well, just remember. If there's a scene, it was all you. I'm sure. DIANE: It was. Hey, are those my other black pumps? Yeah. No. These are not your other black pumps. They are my other black pumps. [DOORBELL RINGING] DEBORAH: I got it. Hello, Deb. Hello, Diane. Donna. Please, accept my condolences about your mother. She was-- I'm sorry. DEBORAH: You killed her. You killed her. She'd be alive if it wasn't for you. You put her-- -Wait, Dad. DEBORAH: Great. Yeah, run to Daddy. Please. DEBORAH: Little spoiled brat. Stay here. Go back up to your sisters. Get off me! You know, this family drinks entirely too much. Get off me! Get off me. Ah. -Now, you listen. And you listen good. That is my father. You may not want him to be yours, but he's mine. And he's shown more love over the years than you can ever know. And whether you like to believe it or not, he's loved you. So if you got a problem with him, you got a problem with me. Yeah, that must be from the new book of fatherhood rules. If you really love your kids, abandon them. Yeah, that chapter was ripped out of my copy. He tried to see you and he couldn't. I know that for a fact. That's bull [INAUDIBLE]. No, Deb. It's you that doesn't know. Yeah. You see this? It's mom's restraining order against dad. And these? These are letters we were never allowed to read. And pictures. Huh? All his. So stop playing the abandoned child and open your eyes. This was a divorce between two people. Open your eyes and see that Dad's not the only one with skeletons in his closet. She's going to drive. She's going to drive! Hey. Wait. Listen, Deb. If you followed me to harass me, it's not worth it. I don't know how much more I can apologize. Why? Why? What is that? What is that? Why did you do that? [INAUDIBLE] Why [INAUDIBLE]? Why? I spent my whole life being mad at you. And now I have to deal with it being my mother's fault. [INAUDIBLE]. Why did you do that? Why did you let her do that? Why couldn't you work it out, Daddy? What did I do? What did I do? [INAUDIBLE] Daddy. I'll probably be better at this than my sisters. I'm not as freaked about you not answering back. I want you to know that I remember everything. I remember your touch. I remember your voice. I don't know why I didn't tell you. I remember that you love me. I want you to answer back now. I'm tired of these one-way conversations. I want my family. I love you. I'm sorry. DONNA (VOICEOVER): So we had a wedding a couple of weeks late, but a wedding nonetheless. Leah's family accepted us as best they could. And Diane learned a few things about the upper class. DIANE (VOICEOVER): And I taught them a thing or two. DONNA (VOICEOVER): Kids, they took to their grandpa like goslings to a gander. DANIEL (VOICEOVER): The wedding turned out so beautiful. DONNA (VOICEOVER): Ma would have been so happy. If there's one thing I'm sure of, I'm wicked sure of that. DIANE (VOICEOVER): Yeah. Me, too. DANIEL (VOICEOVER): So that's the story. DIANE (VOICEOVER): Hey, is that my microphone. DONNA (VOICEOVER): No, this is not your microphone. DIANE (VOICEOVER): Yes, it is my microphone. Get off of it. DONNA (VOICEOVER): OK. Take it. I don't care. DIANE (VOICEOVER): Thank you very much. DONNA (VOICEOVER): It's not yours, you know? DIANE (VOICEOVER): Well, I'm borrowing it. DONNA (VOICEOVER): It's the churches. DANIEL (VOICEOVER): And that's my family. DIANE (VOICEOVER): [INAUDIBLE] said I could use it. DONNA (VOICEOVER): I bet. DIANE (VOICEOVER): Well, they did. [INTERPOSING VOICES] [MUSIC PLAYING]
