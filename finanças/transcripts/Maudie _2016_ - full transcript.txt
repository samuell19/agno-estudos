She's been asking to go home. - Well, did you tell her? - Not yet. I thought it best you do it. She has to understand. This is her home now. - I can't keep her here. - But we agreed, Aunt Ida. You said you'd look after her. I am paying you to look after her. - Hello there, Charles. - Sister. - Good to see you. That's a nice suit you're wearing. - Oh! Yeah. - Perfect fit. You're always such a spiffy dresser. So you've... ...come to take me home? - No. No. Well, it's business, Maud. Uh, financial matters. - Oh, good. Well... I'm a natural at math. Remember? Always used to check your numbers when you... you were in school. Didn't I, Aunt Ida? - -I wanted to drop off a few things for you. - Lordy! You cleared out my room. Why? - I sold the house. - What? Our house? - Maud, Mom left it to me. - No! You can't! You can't sell our house. Charles! You can't sell our house. I-I'd... I'd look after it. I'd be more than happy to have my own place. Charles! - You can't look after yourself, let alone a house and a yard and-- - I'd get a job! I'd get a job or something! - A job. A job doing what? - I don't know, Charles! - I'm sorry, Maud. It's done. - No! Wait! Charles! Charles! Charles, wait! Don't, don't... - Goodbye, sister. You take care of yourself. - No. Wait! Charles? - Maud, come get your tea. - Charles! Charles! Wait! I'm going to do some painting out here. Too messy. - Why don't you put your things away in your room? - Why don't you leave me alone? - You better not tell me you were out at that club. - I wasn't gonna tell you that. - Where were you? - At the club. Wasn't gonna tell you that. I was looking to meet friends. - That's what you said the last time. Look what happened. - You should try it sometime. You might like it. This is new. - Well, well, well. Look who's gracing me with their presence today. - What can I do for you, Everett? - I'm looking for a woman. - A what? - A... a... a hou-housemaid. Looking for a housemaid. - Not the kind of thing we sell. - Am I... am I an idiot? Huh? I wanna put up a sign, you know, a... what do you... what do you call, um... Well, I need you to... to write-- - Write a sign. - Yeah. Mm-hmm. - Okay. - Mm-hmm. Looking for... a housemaid. Must have her own, um... Oh, shit!! Her own... What's the word I'm looking for? - Sense of humour? - No. No. Uh, cleaning tools. Must have her own cleaning tools. That's it. That'll do it. Yeah. And then you-- - Contact Everett Lewis. - Yeah, sign my name. Right. Here, give it to me. That's it. I need a hand, that's all. - Hello, big boys. Beautiful. You are. Hey. Hey. You a guard? You a guard dog? Hey, hello. Hello. Oh. Hello. Um. I'm Maud. Dowley. - Dowley. - Yeah. That's right. I was... I got your ad at the store. The one you posted, looking for a housemaid. You know. Well, I'm answering it. - Uh... looking for a woman. - Well... what do you think I am? So... um, well... Well, I... I-I walked here from Digby. Wouldn't mind a cup of tea. You can tell me what you're looking for. Thank you. So, um... This all yours? This... this house? - Uh, yeah. - Nice. - Used to be... Captain John Ryan's. But I moved it here from the wharf. Guess how many, uh, oxen it took to move it. - Two? - Not two. No. Seven. Seven oxen. - That's a lot of oxen. - Yeah. Be nice... ...for you to have someone around here. Must be hard to do it all on your own. - Well, you got that right, ma'am. Got that right. You know? - What is it you do? - Sell fish. - Oh. - Sell chopped wood. You know? Work at the orphanage. - Oh. Lordy. - Yeah? - How do you keep it straight? - Got a lot on my plate. Got a lot on my plate. - Yeah? I'd like the job. - You walk funny. You a cripple? - Oh, No. - No? You're not sick or nothing? - No. I was just... I was just born funny. It don't stop me. I can do... the work of five women. You got an ashtray? - Flick 'em on the floor. - Thanks. Ouch. Many women apply for the job? - You finished with your tea? - Um. Might as well say it. Uh... I'll put that... Well... you do need the help. I can see that. Ah, a long walk home. I bet they'll throw rocks at me again. - Who throws rocks? - The kids. They don't mean it. They don't mean it. I don't care. Some people don't like it if you're different. It's a lot of work to break in a new shoe. Heels are galled right off. - This is as far as we go. - Huh? - Far as we go. - Oh. Okay. Uh... Uh... - Everything okay, Everett? - Thinking about hiring a woman to help around the house. But... slim pickin's applied for the job. - Someone actually applied? - Might be better off with one of these boys. - These kids are too young, Everett. - When I was their age, I did the work of ten men. Cleaned this yard, chopped wood, built that fence. - Yes, but you were here, around people. Everett? If someone applied for that job, hire them. - Hi. Nice day out. - S'pose I'll give you a try. Mm. - That'd be nice. - Mm-hmm? - Mm-hmm. Be nice. - Maud! - You gonna stand there all day? - No. No. - What do you think you're doing? - Yeah! Coming. Coming! - You're neglecting your chores. - Yeah. I know! - God in Heaven. - Yeah. I'm a grown woman now. I'll go off and find my own place. - You can't look after yourself, Maud. - I know you think that. - You are determined to put a stain on this family name. - Mm-hmm. - If you leave now, you're never coming back. Do you know that? - Yeah, I know. I know that. Sorry. I got a job now. You've been good to take me in, but I gotta go now. He's waiting in front. Bye, Aunt Ida! Go! Uh... I'm assuming... assuming I'm working for room and board, but... I was thinking an extra 25 cents spending money as well. A week? Alright. - There you are. Thought you left me for a minute. What do you want me to do first? - If I gotta stay and worry all day, may as well do it myself, hmm? - No. - You going through my stuff? - No. No, just... pretty. - You think that's why I brought you out here? So you could go through my gear? Huh? - No. I made you soup. - What is that? Hmm? - Turnip. - I... I don't eat turnip. - Oh. - You haven't even cleared the table. - I was just... - You want me to pay you money, but you don't know a click about cleaning. - Uh-- - No, no, no. No, not gonna work. No. No lazy arses around here. No lazy arses around here! - No! Stop! - You get your stuff and you get out! - No! Stop! No! No! No! No. Why did you do that? Where do you want me to go, huh? - Shoulda thought of that when you were sitting here, twiddling your thumbs, going through my stuff. - I didn't know what you wanted me to do! - I don't wanna have to look after you! I want somebody who's gonna do the looking after! Not some crippled-up woman. Now get out! - I'm getting out! - It's my house! My house!! - Hello. Hello! Yeah, it's time. Oh... Oh, you know, don't you? You know. Hey, hey, hey. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Hey, hey, hey, hey. It's okay. Shhh-shhh. I know, I know. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. It's okay. Ah! It's alright. Oh, dear! It's alright. It's alright. Yeah, I know. I got you. Shhh-shhh-shhh. I know. Sorry. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. - That's my chair. - Hmm? - That's my chair. - Want a bowl of stew? - Where'd you get the chicken? - Killed it. - You killed it? - The big one. - So... I'm gonna stay. Where do I sleep? - Well, you gonna follow my rules? - Mm. - Mm-hmm? You cleaned? You clean upstairs? - No. - No? - There's only one bed up there. - You a princess, are you? When I was at the orphanage, they put us six, seven to a bunk. Elbows in my back. Feet up my ass. If you're too fancy to pile in, then you can take your little knickknacks, put 'em in the red wagon, and get out. - No, I'm-I'm good up there. I'm not too fancy. Bad dogs! Down! Get down! Down! Yeah, good boy. - Who told you you could talk to them dogs like that? - What? They gotta learn. - Them dogs been here longer than you. More useful too. - I'm only trying to feed 'em. - Let me tell you how it is around here. Alright? There's me, them dogs, them chickens, then you. - Everyone's talking. He has you barred up in there as his love slave. It's disgusting. - Everett with a love slave. Would it make it more proper if I married him? Then maybe people won't talk so much. Aunt Ida? Wanna come visit me sometime? - I wouldn't be caught dead. I wouldn't even drive by that house. - Suits me. Love slave. - What are you gonna do with all this, Ev? - Sell it. Just leave it. - Sell it? Who'd buy that? - Hello. - Uh... hello there. - Hello. It's a nice day. - Everett got himself a woman? - Get back in the house. - What's this now? - Ah! She works for me. Hmm? Need somebody to mind the house. Else I get robbed. - So you got yourself a tiny little woman to guard your house. Couldn't you get a meaner dog? Or a gun? Wait. Come here. I'm Frank. I'm the fisherman he tries to cheat every day. - He wouldn't cheat you. He's a good man. - Ah. So... so you don't know him well, I see. - Mm-hmm. - I'm Maud. Dowley. - Well, it's nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - So you're working here, then? - I'm living-- - That's enough. - So you got yourself a live-in maid, do you? - I'm out all day. Work hard. Deserve to come home to a clean house. Don't I? - Where do you fit? - There's more room in there than you think. We find it cosy in there, don't we? - Get back in the house! - Oh! I'm in charge of this house. If she don't know it, she'll learn it. - Nobody in their right mind would put up with that for very long. - She's not in her right mind. That's one thing I know. Learned your lesson? - Do you want me here, or don't you? Hmm? 'Cause I'll go. I'll walk out right now. Well, do you want me here, or not? I'd like my pay, please. You haven't paid me yet, not once. Two months. Hello? Anybody home? Hello?! Are you the fish pedlar's wife? - Some snazzy shoes there. Oh. No. Sorry. - Well, is he around? - Uh... He's... he's out on his rounds. - I paid for fish. - Mm-hmm. - And he never delivered. - Oh, well, uh... Sometimes he forgets. - I paid him. Plus a handsome tip. Now, I'm here from New York City for the next few months. And I can give him my business. Or not. - You... you sure he never dropped off the fish? Maybe a dog ran off with it. - I don't have a dog. - Or a cat. Cats love fish. - I don't have a cat, either. - Oh. Well... I'll tell him you came by. - Say. - Yeah? - Did you paint that happy little chicken? - Actually, yeah. It was a chicken out in the yard. Real fat. I wanted to remember his happier days, so... ...I painted him. Well, I'll tell him to square up with you when he gets home. - I'd appreciate that. What's your name? - Maud. - Nice to meet you, Maud. I'm Sandra. - Nice to meet you, Sandra. Hey, those snazzy shoes? They comfy? - Uh... they're not bad. - No, they're not bad. All they way from New York City. - Who told you you could paint fairies on the wall? Huh? - They're not fairies. They're birds. - Well, who told you you could do that? Huh? - Well, you did. - What? - You said... you said... make the place look alright. I think it looks alright. - No painting in this corner. Uh-huh? I don't want paint on my boots. No paint on my gear. The rest is... fine. Birds or fairies. I don't mind. - Mm. I might do that. Good? - Mm-hmm. - Mm-hmm. Long day. Hmm. Must be hard... running a business. My brother, Charles, used to run one of them jazz clubs for a while. - Mm-hmm. - People... always on his back for money he owed them. - I never owed nobody nothing. - Mm. Charles say the same thing. Couldn't prove it, you see. - People are stupid. - You're not. You keep track of it all in your head. Most people can't, you see. That's why you gotta write it all down. I can write it down for you, if you like. I'm good with writing. So. Who... owes... Everett... ...Lewis? Hmm? - Donovan. - Donovan. - Mm. - Mm, Donovan. - Owes me for six fish. - Six fish. - Mm. That... is a bird. - What? - That. I don't know what that is, but it's not a bird. - That is finished. It's got a beak on it. That haven't got no beak on it yet. Are you gonna do that? We better get married. - Costs money. - Hmm? - Foolish. - Only if you invite people and stuff. - Mm-hmm. - Give 'em supper. - Uh-huh. Gotta pay a fee. For a... a license. Hmm? - Hmm. - Yeah. - Charles had a fancy wedding. God, I wouldn't do that. I'd do it cheap. I wouldn't invite anyone. Wouldn't do what Charles did. - What are you talking about him? Hmm? - Well... you plan on doing what you're doing, I think we should get married. - Mm-mm. Mm-mm. - I don't want to get in that sort of trouble again. - What kind of trouble? - I had a baby. The baby died. She was real deformed. They buried her when... When I was sleeping. - Here. You wanted three fish. I owed you for two. So... now you owe me for one. - It's a card. - We-we-we figured it out on the card. - We're rendering accounts. So... you know, it won't be... a mix-up. - And how do I know this is right? - 'Cause I said. - We could, maybe, uh... start clean... from now on. Keep track... maybe. - Give me a moment. - I am the boss. - Yeah, you. I know that. - Who's in charge? - You are. - I bring in the money. Right? - Yeah. - Yeah. So who's in charge? - Yeah, you are. - Yeah. Right. Don't forget it. - I won't forget. Can't forget it. - I'll pay you. If you make me some more of these cards. - I dunno. He's in charge, so... ...ask him. - Throw an extra five cents? - How about ten cents a card? - Sounds good. Suits me. - Good. I'll take my fish. I look forward to these cards. Very much. - Thanks. See what I can do. Wait up. You're good, Ev. You know? You know what you're doing. Asking for that money. Pretty house.

Three more. - Pfft... I don't know why people pay money for these. My five-year-old could do better. - Maybe. Maybe he could. But he didn't. Maud did. Brushes, please. - You're an idiot. - You're an idiot. Stupid. - Know-it-all. Whoever it is, tell 'em to get out. - Get out? - Yeah. - Yeah? - It's suppertime. - Yeah. I don't know. - Hello. - Hello. - May I come in? - Uh, um, well, we're... Come in. - Why, thank you, Maud. - Would you like a bowl of soup? - Oh, no, thank you. - No? Here, sit down. Like cup of tea? - I'm fine, Maud. The reason I'm here is, I'd like to see one of your larger paintings. - Oh. Well... Well, I... I don't do larger paintings. Just the little cards. - I'm willing to pay your price. - Mm. Yeah, she does. Yeah, we got some fine gobs of paint here, splashed on these boards. - No. - Oh, yeah. These'll be right up your alley. - Uh... - Oh! Look at that. A lovely winter scene. - There's some deer. - Wow. Isn't she beautiful. - Yeah, I... haven't finished it. - And this tree has red leaves, this one has green. - Mm-hmm. - What season is it? - Uh, well, I... guess it's everything... that's pretty about all seasons. - Yes, it is. - Well, how much? Hmm? How much? - No. - What's your price? - Five dollars. - Done. - But-- - Done. - No. No. Uh, no. I'm... not selling. - It's alright. - Yeah. - No. Uh... not selling that one! - Already sold. - I haven't finished it. I... haven't finished it. - Just pulling your leg, now. It's a joke. This one's not for sale. - You know, I have an even better idea. Why don't I commission you to paint me something? You can paint me anything. On a board just like that. Whatever you want. And I'll pay you for it. You can send it to me in New York. Show me how you see the world. - For five dollars? - Five dollars. - Uh... to New York, that's a long way. Does that include postage? Thank you. Goodbye. - Goodbye, Maud. Sandra. - Sandra. - You guys are best friends, huh? - Sold a painting. - Mm. Mm... - Glad I kept painting. - This is your first. Yeah? - Six dollars. - Yeah. Boy, she's an idiot. Give her one of the ones you already got. - No, I wouldn't do that. Everett? - Mm-hmm? - You like 'em? My paintings? - How am I supposed to know? Huh? Do I look like a woman? Hmm? - No. - Hmm. But I know what that is. Huh? - It's a tulip. - No. That's my name. Huh? - Oh. - What's my name doing there? - Well... you know... I figured we're in business together. The painting's half yours. Your name should be on it too. Mm-hmm. - Not forgetting about your housework, now, are ya? - No. No chance of that. I just gotta finish this one first. - You don't wanna neglect your chores. - I won't. - Well... I'll do the sweeping, but... I'm not doing everything. Hmm? - No, no, no, no. You'll get dust on it. Not dry. It's still wet. If you do that, close the door. Tell me when you're finished. - Mm... no. No. You're trying to claw your way into my life like that. Huh? Then you're wrong. As soon as you stop doing your work, then you're out on your duff. I'd rather stick it into a tree. Want some tea? - Not your tea. - Mm. Well... if you don't know what I'm like by now, then you are stupider than you look. - We live together. We lay down together. Why not get married? - Just 'cause I don't have women banging down my door doesn't mean I gotta marry the first one who comes along. - We been living together for some time now. A lot of people do. - I don't like most people. They don't like you. It's true. - I like you. You need me. You look nice. - Well, I don't know if I should offer congratulations or condolences, but give us a hug, Maud. - Oh. - And you... be nice. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm still gonna be contrary tomorrow. - Yeah... I know. Like a pair of... ...odd socks. - Mm. One stretched-out, misshapen one. One with lots of holes. - No. - Yeah. Crusty and grey. - No. - Mm-hmm. - One... ...a plain white cotton sock. - Mm. - Yeah. - No. - Mm-hmm. - You'd be... royal blue. Hmm? Canary yellow. Wise-ass. That's fine. Yeah, yeah. Over. Yeah. No. Yeah. There you are. - Don't nail it. - Not gonna. Not gonna nail it in. Just don't want it to fall over. - I can see you! - Yeah, I see you. Good? - Mm-hmm. "Her paintings can be found on display at her home in Marshalltown, Nova Scotia... ...where she lives with her husband, Everett Lewis." See? They do mention you in here. - Let me see that. - Mm. "A local fish pedlar." "Everett Lewis. Local fish pedlar." - There it is. - There you are. Can I help you? Charles? Sister. - What are you doing here? - Well, I heard... read about you. Wanted to come see for myself. An artist, huh? - You never called me an artist when we were young. - Oh... - No different now. Want a cup of tea, Charles? - Uh, no, no. Thank you for asking, though. - Mm-hmm. - So, uh, where's your, uh... ...your man? - Out on his rounds, I s'pose. He'll be back soon, if you want to meet him. - Oh, I don't have much time. I just want to... come by and... maybe get one of your paintings, huh? - Yeah. - Aunt Ida said you don't see a nickel of money from these paintings. - That right? - Yeah. - Hmm. - What's he doing with your money, Maud? Why isn't he building onto the house? Getting the place wired? - Why would he want to do that? It's his house. His choice. - Yeah, but you're capable of making decisions, aren't you, Maud? - Oh, yes. - Yeah? - Yes, I am. - You know, Maud, you need someone to give you advice on how to handle your money. - Hmm. - Someone a little more savvy than him. Someone-- - Like you? - Well, I know money, yeah. - You know debt. Selling Mom's house. You like money too much, Charles. - Hello. - Everett. - Hmm? - My brother, Charles. - Hello. - Come to buy a painting. - Mm-hmm. - Just, uh, which one, huh? - Big ones are five dollars. - You gonna buy one, or what? - Ha, yeah. Just grab one. - That one's six dollars. Price gone up. - Six. You owe me, uh... It's, uh, it's lovely. - Bye, Charles. - Goodbye, sister. - Get out. Got a letter today. From... Vice President Nixon. - What did he want? - A painting. - A painting? - Mm-hmm. Unless he sends money for a painting... ...I won't send him any. - Good. That's good. - Maybe then we can afford a screen door? - We don't need a screen door. I'm the one working 14 hours a day so you can sit there in the corner and paint away. - Yeah... My paintings earn money. - Yeah, you bring in a few pennies. But I'm the one doing all the work. Right? - Yeah. - You can't even keep a fire going. I want a cup of tea when I get home. - Gets hot in here in the day. - Yeah, so? Open the door. - Mm. Flies get in. That's why we need a screen door. - No screen door. - Can I get you to hold it up a little bit higher, please? Thank you. Alright. How long did it take you to make this painting, Maud? - Well... two... two, three days. - Two days? Two, three days? Yes? Do you enjoy painting? - Oh, yes. I've been doing it all my life. - Mr. Lewis, come out. Please. Join us. Can I get you to look towards the camera this way, Mr. Lewis? And smile, maybe? Nice. Thank you. - You've painted most of the house. - Well, started with the birds and the flowers. From there. And he didn't... tell me to stop, so... I kept going. - Everett, you must feel very lucky to have Maud as your wife. Maud Lewis has been an artist most of her life. Her paintings have even been sold to Vice President Nixon. This happy couple, who only live with the bare necessities of life, and yet, somehow, they flourish. I chop the wood. I do the dishes. Now all she does is paint. Paint a picture a day. Paint in all seasons. - I told her, a wife is supposed to mind her husband. She does what she likes. - Who would have thought this little arthritic woman, living on the fringe of society, would have such incredible and far-reaching success? You can find Maud Lewis, still selling her paintings, from the front steps of her little house, here in Marshalltown, Nova Scotia. Take it easy there, Ida. Hold my arm. That's it. There you go. - I saw you. On the news. You lucked into it with her, didn't ya? She's all smiles, and you nuthin' but grumbles. Wait. I want you to tell her to come see me. Please. I can do it. I can do it. Go. Never you mind about how sick she was. I asked you a question. What? - Oh... What? - Was I nasty on the TV? - No, Everett! - Well, everyone's giving me queer looks, talking about be behind my back. - Never mind what other people are doing. - Everyone thinks you're sweet as pie. - Mm-hmm. - They don't know. They don't know what you're like to live with. - Well... Is that right? - Yeah. - Get up. - What? Where we going? - Get up! - Where we going?! - Aunt Ida's! - No. - Yeah. - I'm putting my foot down. - Huh? - Not going. - What? Everett! What if she dies and I didn't get to say goodbye, huh? - What if I die and you're not here and you didn't get to say goodbye? - You're being silly. - No. Not taking you. - I don't need you. I can get there on my own. - You don't even... You don't even know how to drive. - Well, no. I know how to walk! Get up! Good to see you, Ida. - I watched you on the TV. - Did ya? What did you think? - You're the only one in our family who ended up happy. - Well... yeah. I s'pose I did. - I don't want to die... full of regrets. - I know. - I regret... not letting you hold her, at least. - Who's that? - Your baby. - I know. You did it to protect me. I know that. You know, she was... ...you know, deformed, so, you know... - She wasn't deformed. - She wasn't deformed? Why did she die? - She didn't. - What? - Charles sold her. - He did what? - He sold her to a good home. Older people. We didn't think that you'd be able to take care of a child. Charles and... and I... decided. I was told she's... she's been well loved. - Is she crooked, or what? - She was fine. - Oh. I've gotta go now. - I never asked for this. Get up in the morning. People. Come home from work. People. Got my face on the TV... for all the world to laugh at. - Everett, listen to me. Ida-- - No, you listen to me! You think that you're too good for me? That you don't need me anymore? Well, that's fine. You go find someone else. Fine. If that's what you want. - My baby, Charles-- - Give up on that goddamn baby! Nothing but that baby! The brother! The baby! Nuthin' but misery. My brother, my baby... - She lived. I thought she died. She lived. - More pain. Ever since you stepped into my life. Nuthin' but pain. I was better off without you. What, you gonna get out? - Yeah! - Well, good riddance!! - Come in, Maud. - Thanks. Sorry. - I've made up the bed in the spare room. - Thank you. Thanks. - Maud... Can you teach me how to paint? - No one can teach that. If you want to paint, you paint, I s'pose. I don't go nowhere, so... I paint from memory, I s'pose. I make my designs up. - I've known you for years, Maud. - Yeah. - It's true. - I know. - And I'm still trying to figure out what makes you tick. - Don't know. Don't... I don't want for much, you know? As long as I got a brush in front of me, I don't care. A window. I love a window. A bird... whizzing by. A bumblebee. It's always different. The whole of life. The whole of life already framed. Right there. - Something up, pal? - Well, she left me. - About time. Eh? - You'd never last here. It's a seven-mile walk to the store. You're... ...harder to look after than a dog. - I'm better. I'm better than a dog. - What? - I'm better than a dog. Hey. Hey, you see that cloud? That one? It kind of looks like a woman with a big arse. Bald on one side of the head. You see? See? She's looking right at you. - I don't see her. Mm-mm. - You can't see her? - I see you. - What do you see? - I see you as my wife. I always have. I just... I don't want you to leave me. - Why would I do that? - 'Cause you can do much better than me. - No. I couldn't. Got everything I want with you, Ev. Everything. What are we doing here, Ev? Why are we stopped here? - That's her house. The white one. - Whose house? - Her. Your girl. - My baby lives here? - Mm. A woman now. - How'd you find her? She lives here? - Mm-hmm. - Looks great. - I'm gonna wash up for dinner. - I'll be in shortly. - She's so beautiful. She's perfect. One... You got... a big bunch of mail there. - Oh? Same as yesterday? I can't go any farther, Ev. I can't go any further. I don't know what's wrong with my legs today. It's cold, huh? - Mm. - Guess I won't be skiing this winter. Everett! Ev. - Okay, breathe. Breathe. You haven't given up smoking, have you? - Give it up sometimes. - You have emphysema, Maud. You can't smoke. - Won't be smoking anymore. I'll tell you that. - Yeah. I have arthritis. It hurts. - Mm-hmm. - Yeah. It's... ...hard to hold a brush now. Can you get me anything for my arthritis, please? - I'll get you something. - Thank you. - And... air the place out a bit, Everett. The air's too thick. - Is he gone? - Hmm. He's gone. - Silly. Here you are. - Tea. - Yeah. Thank you. - There you go. - I got it. You shoulda kept more dogs. - I don't want any dogs. - You like dogs. - I got you. - You know... ...you should get some more dogs. Hey. Are drinking all my tea? - Mm-hmm. There you go. - Share it. - Maud? Maudie? Come on now. What is it? What is it? Can you get in there? Yeah. Alright. - Everett? Everett! Everett?! She's going to be alright. We'll look after her now. You're going to be fine, Maud. - I knew you were getting sicker. But every time I'd ask, you'd lie to me. How I ever thought you weren't perfect? Huh? - Shhh-shhh. Come here. Come here. I was loved. I was loved, Ev.
