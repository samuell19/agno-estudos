Translated from the Chinese DVD subs, please pardon the mistakes! It was the time of the Warring States There were 3 feudal states that shared a common border Hayakawa was the largest and most influential The alliance between Akizuki and Hayakawa led to greater prosperity The Yamana clan, stricken by poverty was driven by desire to seize control over the miltary powers of the 3 feudal states They launched an offensive on Akizuki And razed her to the ground However, the remnants of Akizuki and its military funds vanished without a trace What do you think you're doing? Listen up! If we don't find the treasure, you dogs will be here for the rest of your life You dogs Keep on digging You worthless scum Get to work Damn it! What's this? I found something! What's going on There's something hard here This is bad This could be Akizuki's military treasure Stand back Get me a torch Yes Sir! Step aside Move aside Step aside Out of my way Out of my way Where do you think you're going? Leave it to me Hey! Hey! Who's there? Who are you!? It's not important, we've got to run We'll be killed if we get caught Mind your own business Get away from me! What the hell! Scram Are you trying to piss me off? Stop following me You saved my life How would you know? What? The explosion from before He was getting all jittery, so I knew there had to be fumes Fumes? There were pockets of poisonous gases from the underground that exploded on contact with fire Are you a gold miner? Ah, yes I'm the carpenter Shinpachi Those were samurai from Yamana Evil men.. Did you have a feud with the the samurai too? Damn it! I'll give you a taste of my medicine Get down! You'll get us both into trouble! Do-don't go Let go of me! Let go of me!! What the heck were you thinking! It's all your fault What now Thank God! Water, water! Water What's this? Is this.. go-gold?! No way... Gold? It is gold It's real! It's gold! Gold! Just like a crescent moon Cresent moon? Cresent moon, isn't that the state symbol of Akizuki Akizuki? Doesn't that mean...? Damn! Found it! Hand that over I found it! It's mine Go look for your own Who's that?! He shot at us Should we grab him? You! Wait! Bastard! Stop right there! What happened? Look He's running in there He can't escape now You've got some skill with that Where did you find this? Tell me How would I know Where did you find it? I said, I don't know Around the waterfall Slightly lower - downstream Idiot! Where are you going You don't need to know There's no way I'm letting you have it Greed is what kills a man We don't know who'll be the dead man We are samurai from Yamana and that's the military treasure of Akizuki You'll never get away with this You're a bad liar What are you going to do about the gold? You obviously can't use it in Akizuki If you're thinking about going to Hayakawa, that's a bad idea The borders of Hayakawa and Akizuki are heavily guarded by Yamana The samurais are everywhere What would you do then? Let's strike a deal I've got an idea A way to escape with the treasure Now, Akizuki and Hayakawa are allied states Those who are carrying Akizuki's treasure need to escape to Hayakawa There's no way... Yamana won't allow that to happen If that's the case It's impossible to escape from this side That's why we've got to do at the right time and enter Yamana Enter the enemy's territory first then enter Hayakawa from there Through Yamana - to get to Hayakawa Yeah, that's the plan But entry is prohibited We happen to know the terrain of Yamana very well You selfish bastard! Stealing our idea and killing us!! What are you thinking? It's gold If we spilt the gold equally Yeah? Yeah? I will take half of it the other half will go to the both of you That's fine, that's fine! We'll accept your terms You only stand to lose if you kill us I will not hesitate to kill you if you ever betray me don't forget these words At least tell us your name I'm the gold miner, Takezo Rokurota Rokurota, the bandit Reaching Hayakawa via Yamana It's brilliant! Going through enemy territory It was only when I lured him with the treasure did he come up with this He's a smart boy Who will be useful to us Him? A simple leaf with a humble background with the determination of a weed The determination of the little leaf He's nothing but a man driven by greed not someone I would view with much regard As for the army's treasure, just do as we planned But princess.. You're irreplaceable I'm not the princess, but your brother Shichiro I stopped being a princess the day I bound my hair up and changed into these clothes Well, that's only a short term strategy It's only your appearance that's changed. Everyone will know you're the princess once you speak Fine! I'll not say a single word when we leave this place Is that alright?! Princess! Just like how princess, no - Shichiro would have put it Right? Rokurota Hey, that's mine It hurts - you idiot In the end, we're both trapped in here If we're not of any use, he wouldn't even bother feeding us Is that so... Excuse me Father, the Yamana troops have gathered at the foot of the hill Roughly - 300 men It's starting... If that's the case, we'll act according to plan and leave in the morning Yes Sir! Rokurota This belongs to the king... This is the king's most beloved... treasure My father told me to entrust my life to you Let's go make the necessary preparations Rokurota Makabe The undefeated warrior of Akizuki one who wields the powerful blade will also have moments of weakness One must have the flexibility of a willow And the power of a blade I've got it, Elder Nagakura He is the blade and I'm the willow No. Princess you embody both these qualities Do you want to stay behind? Stay here in this city? Prepare the men for battle Yes Sir! Princess We'll reach Hayakawa Elder Nagakura Brother It's your privilege to be the princess's decoy Yes It's all up to you, Sayae Do take care, brother Suspicious fella Hey, Takezo, Takezo! You! Last night, you actually He's my younger brother, Shichiro Young brother? My brother can't speak anymore It's all because of the pebbles you threw No matter how You're carrying so little! Look at how frail he is. There's only so much he can carry Then you should be carrying his share! Fine. Let's go You first Hurry up! Take it Stick it on your wound. It'll help to relieve the pain Hey! What's happening over there? It's Yamana They've come to rob us of the gold Lord Takayama There's no mistake It's Elder Nagakura from Akizuki Suicide... In that case, this must be Princess Yuki The line of Akizuki has ended here We should be able to find the treasure soon enough Where's Makabe Rokurota? He should remain by the princess's side We've not found him, dead or alive If the princess did commit suicide, Rokurota would have followed her to death Even so... This woman can't be Princess Yuki They burned down the city because they knew they would lose the battle This only proves that the princess has fled In that case We need to strengthen the patrols around the border They must be headed towards Hayakawa now Yes Sir! Saye Elder Nagakura I've let you down It's an honour to die for loyalty My sister will surely... No If I were Saye, I would surely hate the princess She was 19, but so am I We only have one chance at life Princess Shut up! You didn't even shed a single tear when you killed your own sister Your supposed 'virtues of loyalty' is something that I'm sick of Takezo, I'm sorry Goodbye Sake. Food. Women Women Are you a fool? Did you really think you could run away We were the ones who found the gold Right. That's why all the gold is ours alone All? How?

Yes... Try throwing one over to the other side of the cliff Those men are from Yamana Damn it! There's no way to pass from here either What is it, Takezo? There's no way We better pass through the checkpoint but we don't have an authorisation pass Hurry up! Get in! Quickly! Thank you sir Next one From the grasslands. That's enough. Let them pass Is that alright, sir? This is the checkpoint of Yamana Why does the princess of Akizuki want to enter into enemy territory? Isn't that like grosss stupidity? But Sir...

Commander, what about the reward? Let's just go You don't have to be apologetic It's your quick thinking that saved me Thank you for your hard work Stop making that facial expression, it's arousing suspicion He should have just told us she was a woman Say Whoever draws the shossssssssrtest stick will be the first to have her tonight, how about that Which one do you want?
