We're losing systolic pressure, Dr. Orenbach. What do you think? Dr. Green, I think there's an ethical issue. Fetuses with Conradi syndrome never come to full term. We have full consent from the mother. She can't possibly understand the long term complications. - I just feel morally... - Morality? There's no morality in this room. Look around, Doctor. No cops, no priests. Just you and me. This is my operation, and you're just the plumber. Now seal all the pipes. Do it. Detective Clarke. -Want some? -What is that? -Turkish coffee. -Looks like motor oil. Talk to me. Ain't been inside yet. Why? What's up? Downstairs neighbor smelled her. First name's Jenny Brown. 45 years old. Apartment 12. Intensive care nurse. Works strange hours. No one missed her for a couple of days, till of course, the smell. Gonna start a canvas. You guys been in there yet? We declared her dead from here. Very funny. Can I get some help in here, please? Help me lift the body up. You should take your mask off. Let your body get used to the smell. Yeah, I'll remember that next time. Careful. What are you looking for? It's an old forensics trick. Once the host is exposed, the entomological life cycles are very precise. They give a great idea to the time of death. What? I'm looking for maggots. -Buckley. -Yeah? I got a number for the only next of kin. -Where's this area code? -Alaska. -Morning, Frank. -How do you do? -Damn good to see you. Thought you were coming alone. -No. What's he doing here? You want to find them or not? Hell yeah. This is my second mutilation this week. Sam's the best tracker I know. Didn't even eat anything. Never known wolves kill for no apparent reason. - One. - One? One wolf did this. There's no way one wolf did this. Alpha wolf. It's probably brain fever. No shit. What's alpha? Alpha's the strongest. Alpha killed the cow, chased off the rest of the pack. One more of those deals and these ranchers will be shooting anything with a tail. Finding the wolf isn't going to be the problem. What is? Wolf finding me first. Sam Brown to base. Standing by, Sam Brown to base. Sam, We've been trying to reach you all day. Over. Can't track with the radio on, Frank. Leave the wolf. I need you to come back in. Fishing game will handle it. Over. Gotta get the Alpha, Frank. Negative, Sam, I need you to come back in. Over. I'm almost there, Frank. The tracks are getting easier to read. Sam... it's your sister. I didn't want to say it on the radio. She's been killed. San Francisco Police Department. Coroner finished his initial findings. This one, this guy, serious freak. Usually when they get a body late in the game, it's a real bitch to find something this subtle. None of the needles that were jabbed into the body caused fatal damage. The bastard carefully avoided major organs. Major fatal blow came from a 20 gauge adrenaline needle forced through the cribriform plate and up into the frontal inferior lobe. Okay, can you tell me that in cop talk? Basically, he took a big needle, shoved it up her nose and into her brain. Charming. So our guy has read some anatomy books, huh? Well, judging from his skills level, I think he'd be okay around a hospital too. Get off! Hey! Hey! Get away! Cops know what to do. They'll find this killer. If the cops can't catch the killer, I can. Buckley, it's come from the Mayor's office. -They're in a real state about this one. Quantico called. -What? Yeah. Seems like this MO has occurred before. All these fucking needles. I mean, the FBI's gonna be sending a team down here ASAP. We've got a meeting in my office in 15 minutes. I want to see my sister's body. Look, I understand that, but I can't authorize it at this time. You'll have to fill out the form. I don't want to fill out any forms. -Ha! -Goddamn it, Buckley. Almost gave Kecker an aneurism. Oh, I'm sorry to disturb you boys. -Anything? -No one's gotten near it. This is a fucking waste of time. -Thanks for the input. -Yeah, half of what we do is a waste of time. You guys want some coffee? No, I don't. Hmm. Heads up. We've got a visitor. Police! Open the fucking door! Do it. Clear. Outside. Stop! Damn it! What the fuck is this? You see him? - Yeah. - Think he was our guy? I doubt it. He stopped and stared right at me. Kecker, do you remember what was in this picture frame? I remember it was a guy. Oh, yeah, I do. He was in his early 30s. Dark hair. Are you fucking kidding me? I have no idea. How much you wanna bet it was our mystery man? I suppose you, uh, want me to send out an APB? Yeah. Why don't you run and do that. -Sylvia. -Hmm? This is the one I want blown up. Let me see that. See the frame on the bureau? I wanna see who that is. Is that possible? -No. -Fantastic. I got that info on the brother. Sam Brown from Alaska. And apparently he left, as soon as he heard the news. This guy sounds like a real nutcase. I talked to a couple of these crazy old guys up there, and according to them, this Sam Brown is some kind of expert tracker. -A what? -A tracker. You know, finds lost polar bears in the snow. Perfect. How badass am I? I did it. Well, that's him. All right. Who is he? My guess is it's the victim's brother. He contaminated my crime scene. Oh, he's hot... in a Jeremiah Johnson kind of way. Yeah, well, I'll be sure and introduce you when I arrest him for obstruction of justice. You do that. Good job Thanks. This one's a stewardess. Neighbors thought she was in Asia. Fellas are calling in the acupuncturist. Naturally. No name. Who found her? Maid service. Hey, Lewis. Hey, Buckley. This guy understands nothing about subtlety. You know, my uncle has a photo shop at the mall? I'd be taking portraits of family pets right now. I thought you hate animals. I do. I should hate this more. Seems like our guy was in a hurry. Why's that? For starters, there's no artwork... and he used half the needles. Maybe he ran out. All right, back it up. Back it up. See the guy with the stick? Just go get him, okay? - Um, Detective Clarke? - Yeah? I think we just found your man. Sir. Would you come with me, please? Detective, here he is now. Sam Brown. I'm Buckley Clarke. I'm the cop who chased you out of your sister's apartment. If you were looking for some personal belongings, we can start releasing evidence. You just have to fill out some forms. I'm not here for my sister's belongings. Then what were you doing? I'm looking for our killer. You're what? I already learned a lot about this killer from his tracks. That's what I do. I'm a hunting guide back in Alaska. A tracker. I can understand your personal feelings, but I'm going to have to insist that you stay clear of our investigation Now we get a black and white to take you down to the station so that you can start the process. Are you listening to me? The killer was in a hurry. There's no artwork. He must have been interrupted by someone. A phone, a knock at the door. Something. Holy shit. Buckley, that's just what you said. These slippers are pretty worn. She puts him in the same spot every night when she goes to bed. They never moved. She went to sleep and the killer pounced. He drugged her back asleep so she wouldn't struggle. Sounds like you two are on the same page. The overmatched predator would need the element of surprise in venom to gain control of a larger prey. This may be a woman. Maybe not. But we're looking for someone small. I got a neighbor out here, dropped off some car keys last night, around 3:30. She walked into the front hall, left the keys on the table and left. Spend some time with her What's this area called? Twin Peaks Park. Clarendon avenue is on the other side. You have a radio? You want a police radio? -Yeah. -For what? So I can contact you when I get there. Where is there? Wherever the track leads me. What didn't you understand about "stay clear of our investigation"? Hey! Unbelievable. I lost it. What is that? It's a tracking stick. Tracking stick? Adjust the rubber band according to your subject's stride. Okay, Once you've established a stride mark... you've made a very useful tool in tracking in a rough terrain. Uh-huh. I thought so. What? The difference between the tracks is unusual. Say our guy is walking with a limp. It's more than just a limp. He's wearing a leg brace? A leg brace? How do you know that? The tear in the tree. It ends here. -What? -Tracks end here. He took the bus. The bus? So we have this guy... that wears a leg brace and limps and he pulls off this brutal murder and then makes his way all the way through the woods to here to take the bus. There are more direct routes to the road. There are better places to hide a car He took the bus. I'm a detective. And for some unknown reason, I started listening to you. I even followed you into the woods. Let you put your nose to the dirt with your little tracking stick. Unbelievable. Shit! I keep telling you. There was nobody at that stop. -Are you sure? -I think I'd remember. Are you the only one who would make that stop? I'm the only boat from 1:00 to 5:00. And you always stop? Look. Nobody is ever at that stop. So you don't stop? If I see someone, I stop. I don't understand. He was there. Well, you didn't think it was gonna be that easy, did you? Just walk in, get a description and an address. But he was there. I don't think you're wrong. But he clearly didn't take that bus and we have to figure out why. Time for me to do my job. How long have the FBI been here? Forever. Damn it! Yeah, and apparently they think I work for them now. Okay. You stay here and don't talk to anyone and you make sure of that okay. Hi. Detective Clarke. Agent Ted Hansen. Agent Leonard Lake. I'm Anne Hughes. Who is she? Behavioral science. She leads the team that specializes in serial killers. She wrote a book. We've got two dead nurses in the Midwest, one in Florida. Same MO. Same signatures as your unidentified subject. No prints, no DNA, no hair, no fibers, no vaginal penetration. We became aware of his existence seven months ago. These murders occurred in June. Now the basic profile we're working from is the killer is white, 25 to 35 and moderately intelligent. He has a... sexual and social fixation with medical professionals. He'll think of himself as a medical professional. You have found reasons to be around hospitals throughout his adult life. How do you explain Melanie Wilson? She was a flight attendant. And... and just for the record, our rape kit results on Jenny Brown were inconclusive. So I just think before I start chasing after some 25 to 35 year old hospital attendant bogeyman... We're not exactly offering up a bogeyman. In fact, we're offering something very real. Yeah. What's that? A suspect. Denny Reese. He red flagged on dozens of computer models. He did four years for attempted kidnapping. There's nothing in my investigation that points to this suspect. - Look, Detective-- - Detective Clarke... I've dedicated the last ten years of my life to tracking and studying serial killers. You have one of these animals walking your streets. He's got a black hole in his chest. And the only thing that fills it, the only thing it eats is human flesh. I think you're wrong. The man you're looking for is incapable of working in a hospital job, driving a van or luring his prey. He wears a metal brace on his left leg and walks with a limp. His eyes are sensitive. He doesn't like going out in the daylight. Although, he's got some upper body strength. He's too small to subdue his victims. Must rely on complete surprise. Who the fuck are you? Um, he's a tracker. He's assisting me. Is that right? And, uh, how exactly do you know that his eyes are sensitive and that he doesn't like going out during the day? He's nocturnal like a bat. Like a bat? Uh, okay, sir, this is a restricted area, and you have to leave now. Buckley, in my office... now! Look... I saw what you did in the woods and you helped a lot. When you... You see how crazy shit is around here. I can help you. We're cops. We're on it. We will solve this. You just have to trust that. What are you gonna do now? Right now, I'm gonna get myself involved in a mess. Look... Here's my card. Just in case you need it. Top floor, the right corner. Police! Open up! Police! I don't think the battering ram is gonna bring this thing down. Go and get the grinder! ♪ Just one more chance ♪ One more chance And taking over ♪ ♪ One more chance And taking over ♪ ♪ A bone in myself... Okay, hit 'em with a battering ram! Let's go! FBI! ♪ I won't let myself be the man I was back then ♪ Hey! Somebody turn off the music. ♪ Oh, no ♪ So I'm taking... You okay? Yeah. You? Yeah. Detective, I think you should check this out What is it? It's a drug sex offenders use. Helps control their urges. This is pretty interesting. These two plates here that they cut through, they were bolted and welded tight. So, this guy was super paranoid, is that what you're telling me? His paranoid of himself. There's no way to get out of this place. No shit. I bet this freak hasn't been out of here years. Better tell the FBI. Goddamn it, Clarke, this is bordering on obstruction! Now, if I see Daniel-goddamn-Boone here in one more-- -Sir. -...official... We were pinned down. The suspect had us ambushed. It was Sam who saved our lives. Well, shit. Well, tell me, at least, that this Denny Reese is good on the killings. Shit. He had welded himself into his apartment and hadn't seen the light of day in God knows how long. Well, it looks like Nick's going to make it. And Hansen says that you and Detective Clark are the reason he's alive, so... thank you. Hungry? Yes. These noodles are one of the reasons to live in this city. It'd take a hell of a noodle to make me want to live in this city. I haven't quite got the hang of these things. No, you're doing good. Just relax your hand a little bit. Okay, now use that top finger to sort of pinch it. You come from a long line of cops? No. My dad cried the day I left for the academy. So, what about you? You come from a long line of... rock climbing, nature loving trekkers? Not really. My sister raised me. Our parents were hit by a drunk driver head-on. She taught me how to hunt, play baseball and read. I knew the moment she died... I was out... The woods tracking a sick wolf. I heard a voice. Her voice. Oh, my. Don't tell me you're staying there. I was just starting to think you weren't that weird. It's fine. I'm not that picky. No. Come on. What are you doing out here? I needed to see the sky. Back home, even the ground's alive. Here... everything's surrounded by pavement, layers of tar... it smothers life. It's the people that make a city alive, not the ground. Living over and under, seems more like reverse social Darwinism to me. You are so strange. Are all the men in Alaska like you? Maybe. Is it true that there are 20 of you for every girl? Twenty-one. Cool. You have a hard time finding a date? Yeah, ones that I want., You're a pessimist. Come on, I'll show you where the couch is. Don't you use bathrooms like normal people? I don't like bathrooms. You don't like bathrooms? You start dreaming about the comfort, your willpower starts to fade away. Okay. There's no bathrooms on the tundra. There's no point in getting used to them now. Do you have everything you need? Pillows, blankets, all that? What's that? It's a bite. A bite? Wolf bite. A wolf bite? You don't have rabies, do you? No. Why? You on medication? Dear, we're in trouble. - He's got us both. - Daddy! Daddy! Do whatever he asks. - Dad! Help us! - Hi there. Now, everything's going to be just fine. Dr. Orenbach. What are you doing? Who are you? Shut up and listen to me. If I press send, on this phone, your wife and daughter will die. Do you understand me? Now, drive, bitch. Today! Clarke here. Sam! Sam, wake up We're going to a crime scene. Okay, I'm gonna take you for three reasons. Okay? Number one... you showed me something much more incredible than anything the FBI had. Two... you saved my life. And three... you just show up anyway, so don't touch anything. Don't talk to anybody. Don't leave my side. Okay. Okay. Okay. Now, let's get something straight about last night. After the whole deal at Reese's, I'm sure there was a lot of vulnerability. But don't start thinking, you won me over, because if anything, it's just the opposite. Because now whenever I look at you, I'm just going to see you naked. Okay. I'm in charge. Okay? Nothing's changed. I'm in charge. Okay. I want some coffee. You want something? I don't drink coffee. Of course you don't. you need to check this out. Was moonlighting over here last night. I walk in and I see this guy, James Orenbach. He's a doctor. Home alone. His wife and kids are missing. One of the uniforms found this under the desk. Needle? Medical professional? Homicide? A little voice inside my head said, "Maybe there's a connection." You were a cop in another life, Lewis. What? And I came back as a crime scene photographer? Somebody up there likes me. Christ, what the hell happened here? You ready to go to work? What the fuck? What's with the stick, man? That's what the word "discreet" means to you? You're seriously desperate, aren't you, Buckley? Save it, Lewis. He was here. How does he know that? He just does. This is where he went in. Back into the woods. How does he know that? He just does. It's the same stride as before. I lost it. Great. It's okay. The track always reveals itself. You just have to give it time. There it is. You see how that plant's trampled? No. This one. Oh, you gotta be kidding me. This is where the track ends. We could have saved a lot of time and just driven here. This guy doesn't make any sense. I mean, was Orenbach a mistake? Was he really just after the wife or the daughter? Serial killers never change the sex of their victims halfway through their killing pattern. They rarely change their signature. They usually become more sexually aggressive, and they don't take the bus. We have no profile, no witness, no real evidence. We've got nothing. Sometimes the search itself is the answer. You know, I got to tell you, the Zen crap is really starting to annoy me. This is not normal behavior for a serial killer. Nope. Then maybe our search has told us something. What? Maybe this is not the work of a serial killer. No, that doesn't make any sense either. Unless... Holy shit. Maybe you do make sense. Look at it this way. What's the real weapon of a serial killer? Randomness. Random victims, random location. Random times. We're not dealing with mastermind criminals. They're cowards. And that's ultimately what protects them. But why pretend to be a serial killer, if you're not one? Because he's read all the same books that we have. He knows how the FBI profiles are built. The needles, the artwork, the ritual. He built us a profile so perfect, so obvious. Even the FBI computer spit out a suspect. And the whole time, we were miles off. Detective Clarke. They found the wife and daughter. I couldn't see his face it all. He had a mask on, and a hood. A hood? You know, one of those track suit type of things. All I can say for certain is that he had a... ...is that he had a limp? How did you know that? Mrs. Orenbach, is there anything else that you remember? Is this necessary right now? Yes. I'm sorry. It is. I think that's all she can handle. If you don't mind, I just have a few more questions. You people are unbelievable. I said that's all she can handle right now. Uh, no. No, it's... it's okay. Do you have to do that often? What? Have to butt in on people's most raw and grievous moments? Yeah. In fact, it's the time when you learn the most in an investigation. It's usually when the truth comes out. What truth did you learn there? Well, he saved preemie babies, right? People came from all over the world to see him. They probably had some pretty heavy expectations. Yeah. Well, he couldn't have saved them all. Maybe he pissed somebody off in the process. Did your sister ever work with preemies? I think she did. A long time ago. At least ten years. Our guy is no serial killer. I've a feeling he's working from a list. If we can explain Melody Wilson and connect your sister to Dr. Orenbach... I think we can get a jump on this guy. Jill, I need you to do me a favor. You people never stop. If anything comes over the wire that has anything to do with a medical professional, I want to know about it immediately. I think I can do that. Okay. Are they in there? Yeah. Sam, you stay here. - Come in. - Hi, Sam. Coffee? I'll have some tea. You've got to be kidding me. Buckley, what direct evidence do you have linking these nurses' murders to this Dr. Orenbach? I have several pieces of physical evidence, a bunch of dead bodies... and the expertise of a tracker. A tracker? Look. I think it points this investigation in a totally new direction. I don't think that we're dealing with a serial killer. I think we're dealing with a killer that has a list. A list of medical professionals in this city. And if we don't act fast, we're going to lose another one. There is a link. It has something to do with premature babies. Come on. If you think a judge in this town is going to let us open up confidential patient files, so the police detectives can start harassing the grieving parents of dead babies, you're crazy. We are so close. All right. Start with Orenbach's hospital. - You check into his records, see if we can dig up anything. I'll start working on the mayor. Thanks, Lieutenant. I pray you're right, Clarke. Okay, ladies and gentlemen. Today we crack the cranium and explore the human brain. Please begin. Stop! Buckley! Where did you get this body? They just found a dead doctor at UCSF. He's been dead about a week. No sign of outer trauma. My best guess, poison. He was a neurosurgeon. No one missed him. Supposed to be in Hawaii, giving a paper. Lived alone. Widower. Let me guess, expert in neonatology. Yes, that was one of his surgical concentrations. -Has he got an office? -Fourth floor. Let's get a team up there. Okay, let's get this open. Can you turn on the lights, please? You can forget about all that. That's my sister. And Orenbach. And Green. Holy shit. It's his list. Okay, we identified the last woman in the picture. Melissa Wilson. She died in a car accident about ten years ago. She also had two children, a son and a daughter. The daughter is Melody Wilson. Twin Peaks' Melody Wilson. The name on the mailbox was M. Wilson. She was also unlisted and a nurse. He may have realized too late he had the wrong one. So, where do we stand? We've put surveillance in every remaining member's house. And we're cross-checking hospital employment records to see if anyone else is connected to their group. They lost half their files when they moved out of Rappaport Hospital. That's why the FBI records didn't match anyone. But we, uh... We can't assume that our killer is working off the same picture. I... l think it limits the field too much at this point. Well, it's a good starting point till we establish a direct link. What does our profile look like now? Who is this guy? Orenbach and Green lost 16 distressed premature infants between 1978 and 1985 on cases that they shared. I'm guessing that somewhere along the line, our dream team hit the wrong nerve on the wrong psycho. So, now we have to cross-check those deaths with our victims and then get out there and start asking some questions. Okay, then. Let's all get to work. Are you Detective Clarke? Yup. l just tried to get you on the phone. See, the problem is I'm afraid l can't help you. l just need a list of names. l have a warrant. No, that's not it. I've got no information for you. The names that you gave me, they've never been involved in a preemie death. Basically, for all these people to have worked together, the baby needed to survive. So what do we do now? l don't know. We pull some more files. We start over. What? Don't you get it? It was right in front of us at the bus stop. -He took the Blue Line. -The Blue Line? For the disabled. We were right about the preemie, but wrong about the motive. He's a preemie who lived. Come on. She's exactly right. We're dealing with a highly intelligent, ultra-violent multiple killer. A preemie born with major congenital and developmental problems is the only answer. All grown up and pissed off. Now we got to start all over. No, we can start right here. What's his name? George Johnson. He's 19 years old. Lives in Presidio Heights with his mother. Jesus Christ. Sam and l are on the way. Well, I'll get Kecker and Moore to meet you there. My son was a premature baby, born with a condition that left him with serious physical deformities. l just don't understand why you're here. lt's just a bureaucratic thing, Mrs. Johnson. We've had some murders that involved medical professionals that worked with your son in the past. We just want to talk to him, make sure that we're on the right track. Well, that's impossible. We only want to talk to him. l said that's impossible. My son... My son has been in a coma for several months. l have him here so he can die at home. God's will brought him to my arms. Now l must deliver him back. I'm sorry. Um... Maybe l could run some names by you. Names? It might help you remember something about out one of our victims. Dr. James Orenbach. Never heard of him. -Dr. Ramsey Green. -No. Mrs. Johnson, these men headed the medical team that saved your son's life. There were many doctors. I'm sorry. I can't help you. I'd like to see your son. ls this legal? What do you mean? l mean, whatever's going on here. What do you think is going on here? I... just don't understand. lt's just a bureaucratic thing, Mrs. Johnson. If l see your son in his condition, and verify that he can't be interviewed, there won't be any more detectives or federal agents. Fine. Follow me. He is God's instrument. His birth was a miracle, and his life has been one of righteousness and purity. l see. May l have one of these? That way, no one has to come back here. Fine. Thank you. Are we done? Yes, we are. l don't like to disturb him. l want him to rest peacefully. l owe him that. We understand. We're leaving? -Yep. -That's the killer. We just walked right into his house. His marks' all over the place. That's it. The search is over. Yeah, I know. You notice there was no urine bag? Where does he go to the bathroom? Down the hall. That's where. And did you notice how hard he was breathing? Come on, my ass. That's why we gotta go arrest him now. It's over. It's him. Look, Sam, I got to do my job. Okay? One mistake can fuck this all up. And you can bet that freak's careful. We've got to be more careful. I gotta deliver the case to the DA. We're gonna take his picture to our bus driver, get a positive ID, get a full warrant, go back, turn the house upside down and he is ours. Well, I ain't leaving. Yeah, well, we can't make any mistakes because we can't risk anybody's life. Fine, but I'm staying. No, you're not. You don't have a choice here. What's going on? Okay, now don't make a spectacle of yourselves. We're gonna come back with full paper. But if anybody so much as looks out that window, I want you to find a reason to arrest him. Got it? Where are you going? Men's room. Okay. You've deceived me. Everything I've done, I've done for you. Sacrifices I made... lies I told in the name of the Lord. You made me believe you were doing God's work. The Bible says to kill the killers. And that these people you sacrificed were baby killers. Abortions. These men are killers. They're the doctors who saved you. Did you kill him, George? Did you? I will not protect you anymore. I never asked you to. -Did you have lotto numbers? -Nope. I didn't pick up a paper. I heard something on the radio-- Let's go, Kecker! This is Apple 7-0 responding. Shots fired 1923 Pacific Avenue. Jesus Christ! We'll check the back. How long were you out? Oh, six, seven years. Buckley. Dispatch got a partial call-in from Detective Kecker. -Have you seen Sam? -No, I haven't. Shit! Help! Help me. Help. Help me. Help. Help. You got... You got to tell-- Where is he? Where is he? Let's go! Let's go! Move it! Where's my car? Come on! Goddamn it, Sam! Shit! Christ! We need an EMT down here. Fast! EMT. Fast! Moore? Moore, can you hear me? He's got Sam. Look at the back. I saw you. I saw you in the woods in Orenbachs. I'm Jenny Brown's brother. Well, that sucks, doesn't it? How did you do it? How did you lead them to me? -I track. -What? I track. Animals, lost people... and... Predators? So what now? I don't know. We set up roadblocks in a five mile radius. Airport, the bus station, train station. Well, he can't move that fast. That's for sure. Hansen, give me your cane. - What for? - -Just give me your cane. - Do you have a radio? - Back at the car. Channel eight. Stay on it. Keep in touch. I think I might know how to find him. Come on. Let's cross. Hansen, it's Clarke. Yep. Send everything you've got to the abandoned Rappaport Hospital, west side of the base. Everyone, you got it? Hansen? -They in there? -Yup. -Did you see them? -They're in there. Right. Buckley, you take your guys up to the second floor, We'll do the first floor sweep then we'll meet and move up. Got it. Your trail was followed very well. Now don't you go anywhere. I'll be right back. He's on the top floor. Let's go. Shit! Freeze! Well, I'll be damned, lady cop. In my hand is a detonator. The building's rigged to blow and I mean, ka-boom! Now if you shoot me, I don't set it off and your friend and I die together. It'll be a shame to end it this way. Don't you want your day in court? Spare me the cop psychology, man. What do you want, George? Well, so now you want to give me a choice, huh? Too late. What do I want? What do I want? I want mercy! Mercy! I want to have never been born. - Mercy? - Yes. Take your little gun and shoot me right now and you can save everybody in this room. Everybody but him. Let's talk about this.
