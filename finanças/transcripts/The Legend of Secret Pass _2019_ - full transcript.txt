THAT ANY ANIMAL THAT WAS LOST AND ALONE WOULD BE DRAWN TO THIS PLACE AND THROUGH THE SECRET PASS IT WOULD BE FOUND. IT IS A PLACE FAR BEYOND DREAMS WHERE THEY MAY LIVE FREE AND UNAFRAID. IT IS A PLACE CALLED NATOCCHUE. A PLACE THEY WILL BE LED TO BY THE GUARDIANS, WHO HAVE BEEN CHOSEN BY THE SPIRIT WIND FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION TO GUIDE THE ANIMALS ON THEIR JOURNEY, ENTRUSTED TO WATCH OVER THEM LIKE ANGELS. BUT IT WAS TOLD THAT ONE DAY A GREAT EVIL WOULD RETURN TO CLAIM NATOCCHUE FOR HIMSELF BY TAKING OVER THE VERY SPIRIT OF ALL THE ANIMALS.
