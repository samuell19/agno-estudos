[Indistinct conversations] Oh, good morning, Miss Claus. Merry Christmas, Albie. Merry Christmas to you. Good morning, Miss Annie Claus. Oh, merry Christmas, Ian. You do know that Christmas is over a month away. Merry Christmas, Tracy. Beautiful bows. Ian, here, every day is Christmas. Of course it is. You are absolutely right. Oh, here's the toy popularity report you'd asked for. Oh. Just as I thought. We have a lot of work to do. Rally the troops. Conference in ten minutes. Hot cocoa and sugar cookies for everyone! [All cheering] [Clears throat] Merry morning, villagers. [Bells chime] Oh, it's announcement time! This is Chester Singleton, Executive V.P. of operations. We have prepared a state of the village address to give you our status for the upcoming holiday season. So without further ado, I give you the man himself, Santa Claus! [Cheers and applause] Go get 'em, Santa Claus. Ahem, uh... My fellow villagers... Cookie? Mrs. Claus and I would like to thank you all for all your hard work this year. Have one. And I'm happy to report that we are poised to have our greatest season that we have seen since I began my tenure as Santa Claus. [All cheer] Now, it is due in no small part to Chester here, and my daughter Annie, vice president of toys... [Cheers and applause] And all of you who have worked endlessly year-round to make this season special for children worldwide. [Cheers and applause] Ho ho ho. Merry Christmas! [All cheer] Merry Christmas. Oh, and that is how we do that. Okay, uh, here we go... [Overlapping chatter] Well, naughty and nice lists are coming in fast and furious. Well, they do every year. A parent's greatest ammunition. Anybody have time for a cocoa break? Who has time for breaks this time of year? I mean, the season's upon us! With you going on sabbatical, my load just got considerably heavier. Maybe you should not go. Oh, father! I've only been waiting for this trip my entire life. Santa, you know that this is her time. None of us would be here if you had not taken your season off. Yes, but I came back to the village and Annie might too. But she needs to experience the world before she can make that important decision for herself. It's a harsh and unforgiving world out there, Martha. Do not listen to your father, Annie. The outside world is so full of adventure and wonder. Why, the day Santa came into my diner... Ho! [Chuckles] Then I was known just as boring old Calvin Claus. Calvin Claus was anything but boring to me. It was love at first sight. Wouldn't it be wonderful, mother, to go out into the world and find my very own Calvin Claus? This journey is about finding where you belong. But if there is a Calvin Claus out there who makes your decision easier, all the better. All right, Annie, are you ready to find out where sabbatical will be taking you? I'm so excited, mother. It could be anywhere. Paris... Prague... Pittsburgh... It all depends on this. Very exciting, indeed. Places that I've only seen on the globe. And I could go there! One of the perks of being a Claus. No peeking, now. Oh, I wouldn't dream of it. This is far too important. All righty, then. Both: Throw away, throw away, and let the fates fall where they may! Where am I going? Where am I going... Los Angeles, California. Just like the Beverly hillbillies! "Swimming pools, movie stars." For sabbatical? Think of all the excitement that awaits you in that wonderland of sunny southern California! [Gasps] I know I, for one, would be absolutely devastated if, come Christmas day, Annie decides to sign over her rights. It... it would be that day? That very day. Wait. Does this mean I'm out of a job? Because I... I... I need this job. My father cut me off, and... Calm... shh... Ian, you have not heard the best part yet. What's the best part? The best part is that, upon Santa's retirement, the head of operations takes over. Wait, you're the head of operations. Yes, I am. I did not make the rules, Ian. I merely follow them. And you know, I have had my eye on you for some time now. Me? Re... really? Oh, yes. You see, Ian, I was not born into power and privilege, like the clauses. My parents came from the rank and file of sleigh maintenance. Mine were in postal management. I have worked too hard... We... we have worked too hard to get here, and it is time for us to get what's coming to us. Now, you stick by me, and you have a very big future. Wait... you just can't force her to stay. What... what if she comes back? I cannot... But he can. Who is Dean Durling? He is the man that Annie is going to fall in love with. The man who is going to ask her to stay in Los Angeles with him. Okay, Dean, Take 49. With feeling, project! Action. Hey there. You know, after my accident, I was told I may never walk again. But Shaw, Shaw, and Shaw got me $180,000! Cut! Let's do it again. Take 50. Back to one! Good-bye. Bye, Annie. Bye. Have fun. Good-bye. Uncle Chester will take good care of you. Good-bye. Good-bye. Bye. Good-bye. Bye, Annie. There she goes. Now, if you get homesick, just shake up this snow globe, and it'll remind you of the home you love so. Thank you, father. [Both chuckle] Ready for your big adventure? I'm more ready for it than anything. Good-bye. Bye, Annie! We're gonna Miss you, Annie. Be careful. Come back to us. We'll Miss you a lot. Be careful out there. Bye-bye. Good-bye, everyone. Good-bye. I'll Miss you. Eat lots of cookies!

Wow, this place used to be packed around the holidays. What happened? Well, the lovely people at super store decided to build a flagship two blocks away. Super store opened at 3:00 A.M. this morning. First 40 people in line got flat screen tvs for a dollar. That is why it is time to pull out the big guns. Gotta do something to restore this place to its former glory, right? Charley Boone's trains. Yep. Care to do the honors? I'd be honored to do the honors. And... [Electricity crackles, buzzes] Huh. Plan "B." Maybe, uh... advertising. Online presence, perhaps. All of those things cost money. And, as my accountant, you should know that I don't have any of that. Yeah. And I don't think I need to tell you that you have a balloon payment due at the end of the month. I've still got a month. I'll think of something. You sure you don't want to stay someplace a little nicer? Look at the name... The candy cane motel. I have to stay here for Christmas. No, it's not the four seasons, but it's cheap and it's clean. You want to make a reservation or not? Great. You're booked. Can't wait to meet you. Hi. I believe that you have a room waiting for me. What's it under? Annie Claus. Uh, k-l-a-u-s. Oh, there it is. The little Annie Klaus. Sounds like I should be saying santy Claus. Your parents have a good sense of humor. [Chuckles] I get that a lot. We have you under the extended stay. Sign right there. Yes, I'll be staying for quite a while. Right this way, Miss Annie Claus. Honey, what happened? Amy Winton and her stupid friends. Those girls teasing you again? She chased me, and then I fell into the mud! But she's just jealous because she didn't get the part for the solo in the pageant. And then she called me a baby for believing in Santa Claus. What? Who would say something like that? Honey, don't you think you're getting a little too old? I assure you there is nothing babyish about believing in Santa Claus. Who are you? That's Annie. She's not a movie star. She's gonna be staying here with us for the next month. This Amy Winton person shouldn't be making fun of anyone, let alone someone believing in Santa Claus. Do you believe? Of course I believe. I know Santa is real. And he knows who's naughty and who's nice. Here we go. Room number six. Here's your key. Let us know if you need anything. Welcome to the candy cane. Thank you. I think I'm gonna be very happy here. [Dialing cell phone] [Cell phone rings] Chester Singleton. First contact is imminent. Excellent. [Phone beeps off] [Horn honks] Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas. What a freak. I know. Merry Christmas. Dork! Merry Christmas. Okay, ignore the crazy. Come on, come on. [Horn honking] Hey, are you thirsty, freak? [Laughter] [Gasps] Why, my good... You all right? Uh... I'm okay. I... I... I... My pride may have suffered a blow. Well... Well, I'll have you know that not many people in this town are like that to newcomers. How did you know I was a newcomer? Um, it was just a hunch. You have a good day now. [Siren in distance] Wait, wait, so you're saying that I shouldn't give people hugs when they're sad? Nope. And don't take it personal when they don't say "hi" back. It's just so different here. When someone back home passes without a smile, then you know that something is probably very wrong. Well, we're pretty comfortable around here living in fear of each other. We tend not to make eye contact if we can help it. When I pass someone without a smile, I like to offer mine. Mom! Here, Mia. Mommy, the pageant was cancelled. I'm sorry, baby. What happened? Mrs. Carmichael's mom got sick, and they had to cancel because she had to go to Michigan. That's too bad, baby. So there's no one else that can direct it? No. They just cancelled it. And I was gonna sing. Ahh, I love singing. Baby, you know I would do it, but I can't pay Carmen any more than I already do to watch the motel. By the time I was five, I knew every Christmas song under the sun. Oh, Mia, I'm so sorry. Music is food for the soul, especially Christmas music. I know, but now it's like Christmas is cancelled. Oh... We can't let this happen, Mia. We? What if I direct the pageant? Uh, Christmas is sort of my thing. You don't say. I directed the spring elf show to rave reviews. Oh, thank you, Annie. I've been waiting for this forever. Thanks, Annie. "Come and play. Wonderland of toys." Wonderland of toys. How exciting! Oh, this is not right. [Electricity crackles] What do you think you're doing? This is a very popular game this season, in the 85th percentile. You have it all but behind this toy from last year. Lady, are you from the bank? I have till the end of the month. From the bank? No. [Chuckles] I'm merely a fan of toys. Oh... hi. I'm Annie Claus. I'm just visiting. I'm staying at the candy cane motel. I, uh, saw your flier and had to experience your wonderland for myself. Ted Boone, owner of said wonderland. [Giggles] Except... I don't understand why you would call it a wonderland, though. That word evokes images of amazement and adventure, which... Your store has none of. Thanks. That makes me feel amazing. I finished that display. However, there's plenty of other work to be done. Well, it does look much better. I'm in the toy business too. Back home, in Idaho... Uh, where I'm from. My family has a toy business there... Uh, in Idaho, where I'm... We have a toy business. Yeah, you said that. So is this family business very successful? Oh, I should say so. It's one of the most successful ones ever. For your town. Yes... for my town. Then I sure could use your help around here, but unfortunately, I can't really afford to pay you right now. I would never, ever take money for working with toys. I'd be happy to help you while I'm in town. Well, that doesn't seem right. I'm here for a short time to experience the world and try to decide if I want to go back and run my father's business. Working in your store would help me make that decision. You're sure about this? Oh, nothing comforts me more than working with toys. Working for free, it must be a very successful family business, huh? Oh... it is. [Chuckles] So when do I start? And I can promise I'll make you all proud. I'm going to infuse you with Christmas spirit while we make the most wonderful pageant ever. Yes, Amy? Will you be re-casting a more mature soloist? Some of us feel that maybe someone got the lead because she started to cry like a baby. I did not cry! I don't think re-casting is necessary. Here, everyone is a star. There are no small roles, only small actors. One more thing. Mm-hmm. I know the script calls for a Santa. Will the real Santa Claus be participating? Oh, heavens no. He's far too busy this time of year. But we'll get one of Santa's helpers to play him. Shall we, uh, practice some scales? Here we go.

I can't talk right now. I'm at work. Time is ticking, Dean. I need you to make this happen now. You know, Chester, nobody could live on this pittance that you're paying me, man. Quit that job. You work for me exclusively. Consider the ante upped. How upped? Way upped. Trust me, Ted, there's a method to my madness. You've been at it all morning, and all I see is madness. [Chuckles] In chaos there is order. How's the train coming? Still having technical difficulties. Well, keep working on them. The store needs energy. It needs excitement. People shop in places that make them feel good. What makes you feel good? Christmas. Christmas makes everyone feel good, and you don't have so much as a single candy cane in here. Well, this might come as a shock to you, Annie, but Christmas makes some people feel like failures at life, love, and the pursuit of happiness. All the more reason to surround yourself with it. You have to give people a reason to shop here instead of that super store. I'm sorry to tell you, Ted, but Christmas may be the best thing you've got going for you. It worked for my father. Exactly. So put out some sugar cookies, throw up some garland, and put up some lights. Oh, lots of lights. Do you think decorating is gonna magically solve the problem of this balloon payment? Oh... Not just your money problems, but your soul. Infuse yourself with the Christmas spirit, and life just looks better. We are treating you today. Yes. Here you go. Excuse me... Are you married? Why? I'm just curious. Prince charming hasn't been lucky enough to find me yet. Oh. Well, you can't give up hope. You're in the right place. One day, he is gonna walk through that door and sweep you off your feet. And then you'll move to his village with him and be crazy in love for years and years. And you'll help him run a successful family business. And then maybe you'll have a daughter that you'll love dearly. Then I guess I better stay in this dream job. That's how my parents met. Yeah. Him! Who's him? The man who helped me the other day. Hello! Hey, hello! Hello! What is she talking about? I don't know, baby. Hello! Where'd he go? Don't you ever run after no man. Hear me? Okay. Not a good look. Don't do that. [Window squeaking] Excuse me, ma'am. It's you. Well, if it isn't the lady soda shake. I'm Annie. Dean. Dean Durling. It's so nice to meet you... [Giggling] Again. The pleasure is most definitely mine. So what, do you work here? Uh, yes. Well, then, this must be fate. Yes. Uh, this would be great for a six-year-old. Oh. I really appreciate your help. I have absolutely no idea what to get for him. Is... is this your own child? Oh, no, no. No, I'm not married. I'm single as the day is long. No, it's for an orphan that I'm sponsoring for Christmas. You know, I just knew I had to do whatever I could to give this poor kid the best Christmas imaginable. Both: Christmas is far too imp... Whew, what a lucky boy to have been chosen by you. Oh, it's the least I can do. You know, Christmas is my favorite time of year. Mine too. I love the decorations, the music, the... Both: Lights. [Both chuckle] I love lights. I love lights. [Both laugh] So... Huh... Thank you so much again for your help. This place is so much better than super store. I guess people don't realize it's here. But I will definitely be back. Bye. Bye. [Bells jingle] [Bubbles percolating] I bet that foot bath feels perfect. Oh... [Chuckles] It's the most wonderful feeling in the world. Who needs a man? That's always warm and never talks back. Why don't you have a husband, Lucy? I had three husbands, Annie. Oh. The last one, he left me with a baby and ran off with a 20-year-old named kiki Keller. I'm so sorry to hear that. It's cool. Between running the business and raising Mia, I really don't have the energy to date. Well, I think that there's a Calvin out there for everyone. Who's Calvin? Oh, it's a... It's a saying that we have back home. It means your one true love. You think the guy at the diner could be your Calvin? Well, I couldn't be certain, but I'd sure like to find out. At least before Christmas. That's when my family wants me to make the decision whether I'll go back and run our business. But I have to see what's out here for me first. Don't you think that's a lot of pressure to put on yourself? Not when you know he's out there waiting for you to find him. I wish I had that kind of faith. How 'bout Ted? That guy from the toy store. He's cute, right? Oh, I suppose so. But he's my boss, Lucy. That would... That would be inappropriate. True. Trust me, I have dated a lot in L.A. There's not a lot of options. Well, you can't have met everyone. I mean, there must be at least 100 people in this town. At least. Let me take that. Oh. Well, I'm not gonna give up. Good for you, Annie. Oh... Well, do you see how silly you were to be worried, Santa? I do, Martha. I should have listened to you. I'm glad you finally realize that. Well, it's time to turn in. Come along. I'll be in shortly. Well, all right. Good night, my love. Chester. Good night, Mrs. Claus. Let's hope she doesn't meet up with this boy again. Well, you want your daughter to be happy, do you not, Santa? Of course, Chester! I'd just prefer her to be happy here. I know. But have faith, my friend. One never knows what the next several weeks will bring. Mm. This is what it used to look like during Christmas. [Chuckles] Is that you? Uh-huh. You look so happy. I was. I loved that engine. We'll get it working soon enough. She's a goner. Death by neglect. Welcome to wonderland toys. How can I help you? Hey. I'm here to see Annie. Hi. Hi. Hey, I, uh... Have a bit of a confession to make. I couldn't stop thinking about you. You know that feeling like you've... Like you've known someone forever? I don't know, it's silly. No, no, no. I don't think it's silly at all. Well, do you want to grab coffee or a hot cocoa? Hot cocoa is only my most favorite thing in the world! No kidding. Me too. Like I said, Annie, this really must be fate. Uh, well, right now? Don't you get a break or something? 30 minutes? [Exhales, chuckles] Yeah, that's when I realized I had to become a lawyer. I think that is so wonderful. It hurts my heart to see people in need. Yeah, I feel like I've been really blessed in my life, so I feel sort of an obligation to give back. Like with the orphans. And how long have you worked for this orphanage? Years. I know. I mean, the kids are really amazing. You know, I feel like if they don't have parents, then they should have a really great holiday. If you give me the name, I can ask, uh... my father to send presents as well. Oh, sure, yeah. It's called our lady of the holy grail orphanage for boys in need. Hey, you're that guy from that commercial. "After my accident, I was told I would never walk again." Kurt, look it's "I'll never walk again" guy! I think you have me confused with someone else. Oh, I've been doing this a long time, and I never forget a face. Well, I'm not an actor. You know, I don't think they hire lawyers to do commercials.

I've gone over this for the past three hours in my head. Two weeks is nothing. Please don't give up hope, Ted. Not this close to Christmas. What does Christmas have to do with anything? It's just a stupid day to go along with the other 364 horrible days that my year's made of. Don't say that! Ted, miracles always happen at Christmas. You know, people keep saying that, but I have yet to see one. Well, you have to have faith. Faith means nothing. I tried it. I tried hope too, and that also failed. I'm not gonna fight the inevitable. Sorry, Annie, but I'm letting you go. I'll get Carmen to stay late and watch the motel. Why are you doing this for Ted, again? Because he's a good person. He deserves to be happy. He's just lost his way, and I'm trying to help him find it again. Seems like a lot of effort to go through for someone who's just a friend. I mean, I would do it for a friend. Yes. Anyone would. All right, you two, we don't have much time. Here are your lists. Lucy, I'll meet you at wonderland in an hour.

Wow, this is really great. They really spruced it up, huh, honey? I want to go in. Do you? Yeah. [Overlapping positive comments] Did you do this? Dude, I was babysitting you all night.

I just wanted him to see what I see. What Dean sees. I gave up on love a long time ago. I didn't think there was anyone out there with the same... Morals and ethics as me. I didn't know that I'd ever find my other half, so I... I stopped looking. And then one day, I wandered into a sink hole, and there you were. My paramedic savior. Stop, Dean. I... I can't. I cannot.

What are you doing here? I went to the motel. Lucy told me where I could find you. Mm-hmm. So... you had a good day, huh? It was a good day. [Chuckles] What you did for me was just... I mean... I have no words. I can think of a few. Such as? Such as... "You were right, Annie." All it took was a whole lot of Christmas spirit to awaken the sleeping giant. We're not out of the woods yet, but we live to see another day. Why would you do this for me? To prove to you that miracles exist. Perhaps they do. Once you witness a miracle, you can't not believe. Oh, Ted, this is just the beginning. There's so much more that we can do. We? You still want to work for me, even after I fired you? Oh... that. I didn't believe that for a minute. Thanks. Merry Christmas. I bought a couple newspapers. Let me see. It's just a blurb, but a blurb with a large circulation. Oh, how wonderful. Every little bit helps. And it's all because of you. No. It's all thanks to Christmas. Oh... there you are! I was wondering when you would show up. Yeah, huge court case. But we settled. And here I am. I love what you guys have done with the place. Oh, it's just a little something we threw together. A little something? It's like I walked into a dream. And seeing you makes it even more so. You know, I'm gonna step into the office and cut these out. Save me one. So hey, Annie, I stopped by the orphanage this morning, and I met the cutest new little orphan. His name's Charlie Brownstone. He's eight years old. You know, passed amongst his relatives. You know, abandoned by all of 'em. He's out hiking one day, and he wanders off and ends up getting lost, and ends up spending, like, three days in the wild eating nothing but sticks and ants. [Half-gasps] Fortunately, somebody found him, you know, and they dropped him off at the orphanage steps. They attached a note to his tattered little sweater. Oh, that's awful. Yeah. See, I just felt like I had to stop by and get something for little Charlie Brownstone. Seeing you is just icing on the cupcake. [Both laugh] How old is Charlie again? Uh, nine. Okay... all right, we have a lot of things for him. All right. Annie... Look, could we have a seat for a second? You mind? Sure. Annie... Do you believe in love at first sight? I'm sorry? Do you believe that when we find our one true soul mate, we'll know? I do. Yeah, it happened that way with my parents. With my parents too. [Chuckles] Huh. Why do you ask? Just looking at you right now made me think about that. Hey, do you want to go out this Friday night? I have tickets to the nutcracker. I'd love it if you come with me. I love the nutcracker. Yeah? I'd love to go. All right, it's a date. It starts at 7:30, so I'll pick you up at 6:30? Oh, I work until 6:00, so can you pick me up here? I look forward to it. Me too. Um... That's Ted. Yeah. [Both chuckle] Oh, we are having the best girls day. Yeah. I love this place. Oh, you want to take your picture with Santa? No, mom. He's not the real Santa anyway. Of course he's not. Hi. This is one of my favorite stores. [Gasps] Ooh, look! Look. How about this for Annie's date? Mom, she's dating a lawyer, not a rock star. Maybe something a little less... Revealing would be nice. Well, I think it's cute. I'm gonna go find out how much it is. [Laughs] Reow. Oh, no, it's Amy Winton. Oh. Throw her a smile and kill her with kindness. Remember, the cure for animosity is generosity. Hi, Amy. [Scoffs] Mia, I'm surprised to see you here and not on Santa's lap, like all the other infants. Amy... Can I speak to you for a minute? Hi. We both know that Santa is real, very real indeed. In fact, I know that you personally wrote him a letter asking for an iPod, a $100 gift certificate to forever 21, and a Teddy bear to replace the old one that Isabella, your housekeeper, ruined in a washing machine. Am I right? Now, your letter is gonna look pretty sad to Santa after he gets one from me, telling him how naughty you've been. I can put you on the naughty list for life... [Softly] For life, Amy. Now, if you'll just, uh... Improve your attitude and apologize, I can put you back on the nice list. Have a nice day. I'm sorry, Mia. Well, thank you. Bye. Bye. Bye. [Chuckles] Merry Christmas. You too. Your stylist has arrived. Who's ready for a first-date makeover? Me! You're probably talking to her, huh? Once I get my hands on her, she's gonna look like a supermodel. I think she looks great as she is. Thank you. Thank you, Ted. I can only hope Dean agrees with you. I just hope he knows how lucky he is. That's a very sweet thing to say. [Chuckles] Well, I don't know why I bothered bringing blush. Ted seems to bring that out in you just fine. [Chuckles] You guys go get ready. I'll finish up here by myself. Come on, Annie. [Exhales deeply] [Cash register bell dings] So, Dean... What kind of law do you practice? Oh, the kind where you show up in court and represent a client. Sorry, matlock. I don't mean to be rude. Just, all day, you know, it's law this, legal that, blah, blah, blah. You know, once I punch out, I like to turn it off. She looks good, right? Annie, you look beautiful. Do you really think so, Ted? I'm speechless. Annie, you are a vision of gorgeousness. You look familiar. I have one of those faces. No, no, that's not it. Where you taking her tonight? Uh, that ballet, then Maurice's. The French place? Yeah, I hear the food's great. I hear it's expensive. Well, she's worth it. He's a lawyer, Lucy. I'm sure he can afford it. Well, guys, I... We best be going. Of course. [Laughs] Bye, everyone. Have fun. [Bells on door jingle] So what did you and Dean talk about? Nothing important. I found him kind of smarmy. He's not good enough for her, Lucy. Look, I don't want to get in your business, but I've seen the way you look at her, and you know Annie has an important decision to make. I am well aware of it. Maybe she should have all the facts before she decides whether to stay or go. What facts do you think she's missing? That she has other options besides captain smarmy. I don't want her to go. And you have the power to prevent it. Hey, you got those books for m... Hello. Hi. Remember what I said. Bye, Ted. Um... Bye. Okay. Who was that? Her name's Lucy, and she would crush you. [Indistinct chatter] I loved that giant Christmas tree. Oh, it was awesome. I've never seen the nutcracker live before, only on video. The ballet doesn't often come to Norpole. How come I've never heard of Norpole, Idaho, before? Uh... It's very small and difficult to get to. But this time of year, it's magical. Every inch of our village is covered with snow and spectacular lights and rows of gorgeous poinsettias. Oh, I'd love to visit sometime. I'd like that. You know, when I was a kid, we had these, uh, neighbors at the end of our cul-de-sac that went all-out decorating. I mean, you know, they had the animatronic Santa, the reindeer on the roof... You know, the whole nine. And everyone called the house "the Christmas house." That sounds like some neighbors of mine back home. You know, when I have a family, I don't care how exhausted I am, but I am picking up where the staidlams left off. I mean, my house will be the Christmas house. I think that's a marvelous idea. All it takes is one family, and the Christmas spirit is infectious. Yeah. I just, uh... I really hope I can find a woman to come on board with me for that. Well, I don't imagine that she'd be that difficult to find. Well, maybe I've already found her. [Laughs] [Door closes] But we're doing better, aren't we? I mean, yeah, but you're not in the clear yet, Ted. And the payment's only part of it. You still have to make monthly expenses. Ah, my good-luck charm's gonna come through. I have faith. Annie. Yeah. [Chuckles] And I wish there was something I could do for her to thank her for everything she's done, maybe give her some of that Christmas spirit she's so fond of. Well, if I know one thing about women... Is that all they want is for a man to listen to what they want and then get it for them. Very true. So what does Annie love? Annie loves lights. Okay. You're gonna have to figure that one out on your own. I think I just did. So I-I went down to the orphanage. There was a little money in my pocket, and I said, "rally the troops. We're going to Disneyland." [Both laughing] They must've been so thrilled. Oh, they were beyond. [Laughs] You know, I've never been there before. Wow. Why did you do that? Uh, I... I just couldn't resist. I'm having so much fun on our date, I didn't want it to end. [Laughs] Me neither. Why don't we go grab a drink, then? Yes. Eggnog? Annie. All: Surprise! What is this? [Laughs] It was Ted's idea. Oh, look at these lights, Dean. Yeah, hard to Miss. They are so beautiful. Well, we wanted it to feel a little more like home to thank you for everything you've done for us, for the store, for the pageant. Hmm. Well, you did a wonderful job. Oh, thank you. Oh, isn't it gorgeous, Dean? Peachy. [Sighs happily] Peachy. [Chuckles] They all have the kindest hearts, father, just like you. Uh, Chester's here. Say hello, Annie. I'm putting you on speaker. Hello, uncle Chester. My dear Annie, we Miss you something awful around here. Things are looking up here, but you never know. I might be back before you know it. Perhaps I'll be bringing someone home with me. Why, that would be lovely. I'm really sorry I'm not gonna be able to help you build sets tomorrow. I promised Charlie brown I'd teach him how to play chess. That's more important, Dean. Charlie needs you. Yeah, I just wish I didn't have such a big heart. It hurts too much. [Annie chuckles] Ted, can you imagine these poor orphans who can't have a traditional Christmas? We could make sure these kids have a real Christmas. What do you mean? Well, we've been doing better. I can throw the wonderland Christmas party for Dean's orphans, maybe even get some of that exposure we've been looking for for the store. Two birds, one stone. Mm-hmm. And a balloon payment. You know, I really don't think they're gonna like this. What do you mean? The orphans will love it. No. Yeah, I just... I mean, it's really difficult to get them up here. You have to get clearance from an administrator. It's a whole... Well, I'll be happy to make the call if you're too busy with your law cases. No, I... I'll handle it. I mean, I'm... I'm the one with the relationship, right? [Chuckles] They can play with anything in the store, take some stuff home. We can do face painting and make ornaments. Oh. [Laughs] We'll help those poor children at our lady of the holy grail orphanage for boys in need, while helping our store as well. Everybody wins. Yeah! [Laughing] You've been wanting to do more, and now you can. Yeah. Yeah, it's great. It's just... it's great. I mean, it's... Really, really great. I-I actually got... I'm gonna go get on that right now. All right. Whew. [Laughing] Ah! Oh, that really looks like snow. Oh, Mia, that's great snow. Channel 11 is on board. They're sending a crew to cover the party. Oh, that's fantastic. This is it, Annie. Miracles keep happening. You know, it's funny. They didn't start coming until you did. Hey, Annie, come here! [Gasps] I love that! Okay, Annie, we've got the ernsons building and the gingerbread house, and the becks just arrived with more green paint. Now, if we can only find someone who's handy with a circular saw, so we can start on the manger. I'm sorry. Did you say circular saw? I did. That just happens to be my specialty. Really? Almost every other day. I mean, I-I could help you out, if... if you'd like. All right. Come out back with me. I'd be honored to. Um, is this thing hard to use? No, no, it's a piece of cake. You'll be fine. Yeah, this isn't gonna end well. [Indistinct chatter] Ted... Have you ever did something you wanted to do, but you were scared? Sure. We all have. This one over here is done. Is this about your solo? Well... What if I mess up or... Or everyone hates it? It's not easy to put yourself out there. I really want to do it, but... I'm scared. It's tough to be vulnerable, to put yourself out there for ridicule and rejection, hoping beyond hope that the rewards outweigh the risks. But you just stand there, frozen... Not doing anything. I love the sparkle! Are we still talking about my solo? Excuse us. Excuse us. Ow! Mm! Ooh, oh! Ouch! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! Uh, it's just a little flesh wound. It will heal. No, no, no. I am taking you to the emergency room. If you insist. Come on. Ow. Ow. You know what, Ted? I'm gonna go for it. No fear. I'm gonna go for it. And you should, too. [Children chattering playfully] Hi. Hey. Um... I need to, uh... I need to rent some orphans. I'm sorry? I need to, like, rent or... or sign out some orphans for the day, Saturday. Were you interested in adoption? Oh, no, I hate kids. No, I just want to borrow some so I can throw a party for them, you know, and the dirtier and the skinnier, the better. Yeah, it's to impress a girl. That's it. I'm calling the police. There's no need to be rash. I'm... I'm leaving. I was just... I was just kidding. [Chuckles] Oh, you look great. Thanks. Listen, everyone! This is our last chance to get this right before we show everyone what we can do, so I need you guys to focus. Santa, everyone, in your places. Shepherds... Once upon a time, in the snowy village of the north pole lived a man who went by the name of Santa Claus. [Holy night playing on keyboard] ♪ ♪ See you tomorrow! Okay. Call time is 5:00 P.M. do not be late. Ted! Don't forget your costume! I didn't Miss a single lyric. I can't wait to see it. Hi. How was today? Were you terribly busy without me? We were terribly busy without you... A welcome problem, considering how business has been. What are you doing here? I came to see if you're busy. Uh, between this and the orphans, busy... no. Overwhelmed... a lot. You do everything for everyone else, Annie. Time to let me do something good for you. I was supposed to have a date with Dean, but he had to work late again. His loss is our gain. Come on, we have to go back to the motel and get you two changed. Changed for what? Where are we going? Just dress warm... Norpole, Idaho, warm. This was a great idea. I love skating. [Laughs] It's so wonderful to be cold again. Thank you, Ted. I really needed this. Well, anything I can do to make this place a little more like home for you. [Laughs] Hurry up, slowpokes! Whoa! [Laughter] Oh! Careful, apolo ohno. Sorry! [Laughter] I think I better go... I'm gonna go sit down. You know, I don't want to injure myself for tomorrow's big debut. I'll see you. [Laughter] Mia, I'm very proud of you. You really earned your solo. Why, thank you, Annie. And you know what else? What? Amy Winton said I did a good job, too. I always say, this is the time of year to be kind. I'm glad Amy Winton heard it, too. Proceed with caution. And now it's time for our couples skate. So grab that special someone and take a few laps around the rink. That Mia is one incredible little girl. [Chuckles] Isn't she? She adores you. It's just nice having kids in the store again. So why have you spent the last two christmases alone? Well, I guess after my marriage ended, I just got used to being alone... No love, no disappointment. But no love, no love. I know. But my perspective has changed drastically since. It's like you came into my store and you saved my life. It's not me. It's Christmas. No, it's you. Aah! Okay, don't let me fall. Don't let me fall. Hey, hey, it's couples-only skate. Uh... Uh, we... we should probably go see if Mia's all right. Yeah, yeah. Um, yeah, that's a good idea. [Annie laughing] Would you like to come inside for some hot cocoa? Sure. That sounds great. [Laughs] Annie. Dean. How was court? Oh, it was good. I won... Again. I always win. Yeah, I bet you do. Hey, I'm really sorry I had to work so late, but I got us a movie and my laptop to watch it on. It's not too late for our date, is it? No. Uh, no, of course not. Well, good luck at the show, Mia... break a leg. I can say that to you now that you're not on the ice. Thank you. Okay, bye. Wait. You're more than welcome to join us on our date. Well, then, uh, cocoa another time? You two lovebirds have a good time. Thank you so much for today. [Engine turning] It was really wonderful. Bye. Movie? [Keys clacking] Whew. Can you finish up? I need to get the children in places, and we start in five. I got you covered. Go ahead. Annie. You came. I didn't know if you would. Of course I would. Why not? I... I thought you might be angry at me. Annie, I'm not angry at you. You have your life, and I have mine, and that's just where we are right now. Yes. I'm glad you came... For Mia. Yeah. Me too... For Mia. Well, I have to get started, so... You got to stop calling me like this, Chester. You're messing with my chi. Our deal was that you'd be checking in every day, Dean. Look, I've been busy. Look, I had to go to, like, 13 orphanages in the last 3 days. I mean, you really ought to be paying me more. You're getting plenty. Now, I need an update. Listen... This girl is gonna be so in love with me when she sees how happy those orphans are on the account of my giant heart that she's... She is gonna be begging me to let her stay in L.A. with me. How can you be so sure? Because, Chester, I am a really good actor. Just get it done. Ticktock, ticktock, ticktock, Dean.

Um, Annie, I want to thank you... Ted. Oh, thank you. Hey, so I liked what you said about going for it. Well, thank you. And, um, how's things going? What are you talking about? You know... You and Annie. Annie is with Dean. Oh. She shouldn't be, and you know it. I'll see you. Can I talk to you? Uh, sure. You sang beautifully tonight, Amy. Thanks. I was wondering, um... Can you tell Santa I've changed? Oh, honey, he already knows. Thanks, Annie. Attention, everyone! There's no rest for the weary. We have another event to get off the ground. We can't let Dean down. He's working tirelessly, as we speak. [Applause] [Sighs] [Knock at door] Oh. Hi. I didn't expect you. Well, I'm sorry I missed your big show. Oh. The orphans needed you, Dean. I got these for you. Oh, they're beautiful. [Laughs] I wanted to give you this, too. What was that for? Oh, for being the Christmas miracle that I've been wishing for. Oh, here... Annie, um... Uh... You know, I gave up on love a long time ago. You know, I didn't think there was anyone out there with the same morals and ethics as me. You know, I didn't think I was ever gonna find my other half, so I stopped looking, you know. And then one day I-I wander into some random mom-and-pop shop, and there you were... My toy-store savior. Annie... I know this is fast, but I think I really may be falling for you... Hard. I think I'm falling for you, too, Dean. Hmm. Well, Annie, I will... I will see you tomorrow... At the store, bright and early. Mm-hmm. Good night, Annie. Good night, Dean. All right. [Door opens] [Dean chuckles] Sleep well. Sleep well. [Door closes] What the...? I was told I may never walk again, but Shaw, Shaw, and Shaw got me $180,000. [Laughs] Oh-ho-ho, I knew it. This is a really great cause, and it looks like everyone is having a great time. Thanks for letting us stop by. Thank you so much for coming. [Indistinct chatter] He's such a good Santa. [Both chuckle] He's a great Santa. What a natural. You would know. All right, children, Santa's gonna take a little breather. I'll be back in ten minutes. In the meantime, enjoy the cookies and ho ho ho. And what would you young ladies like Santa to bring you for Christmas? [Laughs] You're the most pathetic Santa I've ever seen. [Laughs] Annie, can I talk to you alone for a second? Kids are having such a great time. [Chuckles] Dean, where's Charlie Brownstone? I'd love to meet him. Uh, you know, it's the greatest thing. He, uh... he was adopted... [Gasps] This morning... Yeah, by a minister, no less, and his doctor wife. What a lucky break for Charlie brown... stone. Isn't it, though? Hey, can I talk to you for a quick sec? Oh. Do you mind? Annie, uh, I would never want to pressure you. I appreciate that. Well, I just... I just think that we owe it to ourselves to see where this relationship is going. You know, and honestly, I'd go back home with you, but I don't think I can leave my clients, you know, not when they're destitute and counting on me for their very survival. Of course not. Look, what... What I'm trying to say... Is I would love it if you would please stay in Los Angeles with me and give us a chance. I'd love nothing more, Dean. There he is. Santa! Santa!

I'm... I'm not following. Uh, I'm sorry. I-I must be confused. Well, I understand this party is all thanks to you. No, not thanks to me... Thanks to Dean. Oh, and which one is Dean? I'd like to thank him as well. Well, uh, Dean Durling... Uh-huh. The very handsome man. He's been working with your orphanage for years. I don't know of any Dean Durling. We just received a call several days ago from the owner, inviting us to this event. Dean Durling hasn't been volunteering for you? I'm sorry. I've never heard of him. And I've worked there for 16 years. [Chuckles] There isn't, by any chance, a orphan named Charlie Brownstone who was adopted this morning by a minister and his doctor wife? Unfortunately, we haven't had any adoptions in several weeks and certainly no one named Charlie Brownstone. Excuse me. Uh-huh. What'd I tell you, huh, ye of little faith? It's in the bag, baby. No, she bought the whole thing. Chester, listen, I did my part. Annie's staying in L.A. Now you do yours. I want my money. No, no, don't mail it. Come on, you can afford fedex, Chester. [Objects clattering loudly] Oh, no. Annie. Annie, wait. Annie, come back. Wait. Annie, come on, I can explain all of this. Annie. [Bells on door jingle] [Grunts angrily] Okay, uh... Well, it's been fun, guys. Um, you hold down the fort. I'll be seeing you. [Clears throat] [Door closes] I never liked him in the first place. [Breathes deeply] [Knock at door, door opens] Annie? Mm-hmm. Annie, what's wrong? I feel so stupid. I believed every lie he told. You are not stupid. He's the stupid one. Oh, Annie, please don't go. I have to. But why? [Sighs] Because... I came here to find my future, and I didn't. Annie, will we ever see you again? [Breathes deeply] Here... Take this... To remember me by. Thank you. [Chuckles softly] Annie... I know who you are. Who I am, Mia, is Annie Claus from Norpole, Idaho. And I want to go home. You be good, okay? Bye, hon. [Sighs] So... How'd you like L.A.? [Cheers and applause] Oh, welcome back, Miss Annie. Oh, thank you. It's good to be home. Yay! Oh! I've missed you so much. [All cheering] It is lovely to see everyone again. How have you been... Good? You all look wonderful! Yay! I'm so happy to see you! [Cheers and applause] Yay! [Knock at door] Annie. Good morning. Good morning, Annie. Welcome back. Oh, thank you. Well, I need to get to it. It's Christmas Eve, and I'm afraid Chester has left us with a bit of a mess. He has been exiled, you know. As well he should be. Um, I'm sorry, Annie. I-I did not know. Of course not, father. I don't blame you. We treated Chester like family. Well, he's on his own now. Make sure you get all that caked-on food off with that scrubber of yours. Okay. You got it? Yes, Dean. I do believe I can handle this menial task. You know what, Chester? Don't give me any attitude. I'm trying to help you out here. You know, Annie, everybody in the outside world is not like this Dean fellow. Your experience might've been much different had Chester not intervened. I suppose so. I mean, you met some lovely people there. Yes. But my place is here. I'm sure of that now. Are you sure, Annie? You know, fate sent you there, and fate always knows what it's doing. We have something we want to show you. Martha. [TV clicks on] If I only told her how I felt... If I ever see that Dean guy again... He drove her away. He took her away from us. We'll keep looking for her, Ted. How? There's no Norpole, Idaho. We'll find her, Ted. Don't worry. I'm in love with her. And I'll never get a chance to tell her how I feel. Ted is my Calvin. Yes, Annie. I always knew it. I just... I just ignored the signs. You know, sometimes an adventure takes you on a roundabout course to your destination, but fate always gets you there. [Laughs] This Turkey is incredible, Lucy. Thank you. It just doesn't feel like Christmas without Annie. I know, Mia. But we are going to enjoy tonight and be thankful for the time that we had with her, okay? [Loud banging on roof, man groaning] What was that? It sounds like something hit the roof. Or someone. What the...? That's a tight fit. [Groaning] What the...? [Groaning] Oh, my goodness, such clatter. Santa! Hello, Mia. [Laughs] Wow. That was a tight fit. Hello? All: Annie! Hi. I knew it. You did. But you can't tell your friends. This has to be our little secret. Annie, how did... Uh... I guess I have a little explaining to do. This is my father... Santa Claus. Father, I think that you know everyone. I do! I've known you all for some time now. So this is the toy business you're in? I get it now. Well, I should be getting on my way. [Chuckles] Yes, a lot of work to do. You know, this is the busiest night of the year for me, but I am coming back to see you. Mm-hmm. Mwah! Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas. On dasher, on dancer... All: Wow. Surprise. So what made you come back? I guess sometimes... And adventure leads you on a circuitous course towards your destination. I'm not following. It took me a day back in the village to realize something. What's that? That you're my Calvin. Your what? It's a... Expression they have back home. It means... My one true love. Oh, that's funny, because I realized weeks ago that you're my Calvin. All this time, I thought I was so comfortable because of Dean... When it was always you. I like that. "It was always you." Mm-hmm. Merry Christmas, Annie. Merry Christmas, Ted. I see that we've got one more present under the tree here. [Gasps] "To Ted from Santa." What is this? Why don't you open it and find out? The Christmas express. [Lucy laughing] A track? Oh, come on. Turn it on. It works. Whoo! Yay! Unbelievable. [Laughter] I told you we'd get the Christmas express working again. [Laughs] So... After your father retires, you're taking over the family business. If I go back. I still have a couple hours to decide. I was hoping for a little help. If I decide to go with you? Then we both run the business. Hmm. So, if your father's retired, then who's Santa? I guess we'll just have to wait and see. [Laughs]
