Hold on to him, Andr?. Let's do this quick. Don't let go. Jesus, what's going on? You'll learn to hold your liquor, don't worry! Dad died. - What happened? - Heart attack. I saw him yesterday! He was chopping wood. He was fine! I know. Where is he? They took him away somewhere. "I leave everything I own, "the house, my belongings and life savings, "to my wife Aline Leblanc. "Upon her death, "I want this inheritance shared equally among our five children: "Claire, Florence, David, Andr? and Lucie. "I pass down my tools to my son David, but only if he wants them. "I love you all." It's signed "Guy Leblanc." Yes, I want them. OUR LOVED ONES Uncle David! - Hi there! - Well, well! - How are you? - Good! - Hi, Simon! How are you? - I'm good! - Hi! It's good to see you. - You too. - Hello! - Hi! Let me take your coat. - Some weather, huh? - I was worried about you. It took two hours to get here. People are driving 40 kmlh! - Maybe you should spend the night. - I think I will. Dammit! A blackout! - Where are the oil lamps? - In the front closet. - I'm scared! - Scaredy-cat! - Oops! - Watch out! Careful, Yves! Marie! Come in! - I was scared down there all alone! - I was about to come get you! It won't be warm downstairs for much longer. This is Marie, our basement tenant. - Hello. - Hi. This is David, my little brother. We won't be able to watch our show! - Blackouts are no fun! - I know! Hey, I have a surprise for you! I almost forgot! - Come look! - You kids are lucky! This one's for Arianne. - She's so pretty! - Lucky! And this one's for Simon. Thank you! - Did you make them yourself? - Yes. Impressive, huh? Let me show you how they work. They're beautiful, David. Did you make them with Dad's tools? Yes. - What do we say, kids? - Thank you, David! My pleasure! The knight walks with a determined step into the forest. And what does he see? A beautiful princess! And what does he tell the princess? Come on. Are you sure it's safe? There's no danger this far out. Really? - Trust me. - I've known you for an hour! Isn't it beautiful? Yes. I think it moved. Did you feel that? - What? - It's cracking! Quick! I'm just joking! - You're crazy! - I'm sorry! - You scared me! - Sorry! It's safe. Look! Stop! - That wasn't funny! - It was a little funny. - Were you really scared? - No! Liar! - Wanna go back? - Yes! You don't like this? - Thanks. - Thanks. You've got quite a view! Do you know how far our land goes? According to the deed, it goes up to a white horse's flank, at low tide. Oh yeah? You take a white horse, walk toward the river at low tide, and when the water is up to the horse's flank, about here, that's where our land ends. That's a big piece of property! Yes, we've got a good amount of land! That reminds me, I wrote something about it. My latest composition. - Really? - Yeah. I planted an oak tree At the edge of my land I toiled for days Will it stop my pain? I planted an oak tree At the edge of my land Will it stop my pain? Will it grow at all? That was beautiful! - Don't you think? - It was! You inspire me, my love. You really do. Hello! Come in! - Hi, Mom! - Hello! - How are you? - Good! Do you want to hold her? Hello, you! - Hello! - Hi! How are you? - Good to see you. - You too. - This is Linda. - Hi! Hi! This is Laurence! Hi there! Did I do something wrong? No, she cries all the time. We made a very dramatic baby. - You want a beer? - Sure! - Do you need help with dinner? - No, everything's ready. Come on! Smells good, Mom! Marie is nice. Yes, she is. And the baby is beautiful. You should really have her baptised! That's out of the question. Besides, we're not even married. Oh Lord! It makes me happy to see you with your family. - You seem well. - Yeah, we're good, Mom. - We're going out. - See you tomorrow. Have a good night! Young lady. Could you take Andr? for a while? He could work in your workshop. Sure, I'll take him. I could use someone, actually. - How's the marionette business? - It's coming along. Come here, Laurence. Go on! Can't you sense the danger? Come on, run away. Dad, can I help you? No, Fred. I'm the expert skinner. You'll see, Antoine, it's disgusting! It's not disgusting! - Are you guys ready? - Yes! I'm taking off its coat. It stinks! Antoine, if you have nightmares tonight, don't tell your parents about this! - Dad, can I have a foot? - Of course, Laurence. - Front or hind? - Front. Perfect. Woman! There's a foot for you to wash in the sink. - Laurence? - Yeah. Hey, that's the Caron's tax return! Is there good money in the gas station? Not bad! Who's the richest man in town? You are, my love. - Hi! - Hi! - How's it going? - Good. I don't know what face to give him. As long as it's not an ass-face! - Didn't we say 9:00? - Yeah. But I had a rough night last night. That's all right. I wanted to ask you, would it be possible to get an advance on my next paycheque? Sure. Are you OK? Yeah, I just owe a guy some money. I think he's getting fed up. A hundred would be great. Thanks. Now get to work! - Can't sleep? - No. You guys save me. What? I'm happy I have you. Watch the tree! It's him! - Surrender! - Never! Really? OK, we'll come get it! Thanks. Bye! - Laurence won a turkey! - How? I entered your name in the grocery-store contest. I forgot all about it! - A turkey? - Yeah! - Hi! I won a turkey! - Lucky you! Come on, Antoine. - Merry Christmas! - Merry Christmas! - Is Antoine your boyfriend? - No! Congratulations! Would you like a bag? I wanted a live turkey. I wanted to name her Simone. Don't worry. I'll take it. No, don't take it! I don't want a dead turkey! Come on, Laurence! Thank you! Let's go! - Merry Christmas! - Merry Christmas! Marie, this turkey is delicious! Thanks! It's Christmas! Can you get me a beer? - OK! - Thanks! - OK, kids, time for presents! - Yay, presents! He didn't leave... Not his secretary! Come on, she's 25! No way! - She's 25? - Yes, I know her! She's 25. She's pretty. - You're way better, though. - Of course! The next present is for Fr?d?ric! Come here, Fred! Come sit on Santa's lap! - Have you been good? - Yeah. All year long? Laurence C?t?-Leblanc, your present has arrived! - What is it? - Open it! A baby turkey! It's so cute! Lucky! Let's take it out! No, leave it in the cage for tonight. Thank you! You're welcome! You like it? Yes! - She's so happy! - Of course! She got a turkey! This here isn't a turkey! No, it doesn't look like one! Simone. Hello, Simone! You know that thing's gonna become brown and aggressive, and be three feet tall in two months? Yeah, I know. That's just like you! - It's pretty cute though! - Yeah, it is! Why don't you look over there? I'm going to take this costume off! I'm hot, dammit! Cindy wants to dance! - We all want to dance! - It's time to dance! You're a real nomad! I travel! That's what I do! Oh, my darling! You were the same way! - The turkey was a good idea. - Not bad, huh? It'll be less fun when we have to get rid of it, though. Here, take these. Drink one with me! - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. Did you notice how red Dad's neck was in his casket? You didn't see the big red marks on his neck? What are you talking about? Dad didn't die of a heart attack. He hung himself in the basement. I think you're drunk, Andr?. Yeah, I'm drunk. But Dad did hang himself. You don't know what you're saying. I'm the one who cut him down. Well... I said it. Do you want me to help you up to your room? No, I'm not tired. David, you'll catch a cold! Come inside, OK? Is it true? Yes. - How long have you known? - A couple years. Andr? told me. And the rest of us? You don't hide this kind of thing! I'm going to tell them! Wait! Lucie and Claire already know. Who told them? I told Lucie one night. Claire was there when it happened. But it's not important. - Why didn't you tell me? - Jesus! - Why'd he do it? - How the hell should I know? Everyone knows except me? - Does my girlfriend know? - No! Mom doesn't know either. We did this to protect her. Why did you want to protect me? You're sensitive, David. What's wrong? Nothing. That's it? This is the outside world? I think I'll be OK! - Laurence? - Yes? Hold this. I'm gonna turn around, OK? Go for it! I'm with you, Antoine! I'm totally with you. I feel really open. I don't know if that's OK. - What are you doing? - Antoine! What is this? What is it? It's my dad's! - What? - It's my dad's! - Why does he have this? - It's for hunting. It attracts geese or something. It's light out! - Will you be able to sleep? - I don't know. My heart is racing. My cheeks hurt from laughing so much. Yeah, that was strong. - Well, good night. - Good night. Are we dating, Laurence? My dad used to ask me that when we were kids. We were definitely dating then! I'll walk you home. - Well, good night. - Good night. You wanna walk me home? OK, good night! Rough morning? I heard her come in at 5:30 a.m. I know, I know. Sorry. 34 minutes late. That's an improvement! - I'll do the bows? - Yeah! Excuse me, Fred! Well, well! Someone else looks as rough as I do this morning! Leave my employee alone! Aren't employees supposed to get paid? We're not in this for the money! We're spending time as a family! Without this, when would we see each other? Later than 8:30 on a Saturday, that's for sure! Well, I'm happy this morning! I'm happy when you're all here. And now, a special request from David, "For Marie, my love, " I Planted an Oak Tree by Gilles Vigneault. - Really? - Do you recognize this? I toiled for days Will it stop my pain? You're so annoying! Wow, Dad! Your song's still on the radio? Yes, Son. I'm what you call a one-hit-wonder! Will it grow at all? It's a pretty good cover, huh? I've never seen a cent in royalties in our taxes! So, woman, who's the richest man in town? I'm doing our taxes now. Oh yeah? Are we all right? We'll be fine. Don't worry. I like you in those glasses. Thanks. Do you think I'm starting to lose my hair? Let's see! I noticed it around here. Maybe a little, but you can't tell. You're still the most handsome man in town. That's good, woman! I'm going for a walk in the woods. I'll let you work. - I knocked, but you didn't hear. - It's all right. Come in. - What are you listening to? - Elliott Smith. - It's good. - Isn't it? Are you excited to go back to school? Yeah. What electives did you choose? History and art. Did Mom send you up here? No, I'm interested! You know you can do anything you want in life, right? You've got what it takes to go far. I regret not going to school longer. I could've gone into music or painting. But you can do anything. - You're being so serious! You OK? - Yeah. But I think you have a real talent. You write well. Keep it up. What do you mean? I stumbled upon your red notebook the other day. What? I just read a little bit. Why'd you do that? You had no right to do that! I'm sorry, but your writing is beautiful! Here. Spend the rest of your life painting your little marionettes. All you had to do was write if you wanted to write! I hate you. I think I have to go away. Where? I don't know. Far. It's like everyone's inside me. It's weird. There's no one on the outside. What? Nothing. OK, Fred. The gas is on the right. The brake is on the left. Come on! All right! Now start the truck. Check your mirrors... now crack open your beer! Just joking! - Now you shift to "D". - "D", OK. Take your foot off the brake slowly and press on the gas. Slowly, that's it. Keep going slowly. Laurence, do you want to practice after? OK, guess not! Shall we keep going? Go slowly, you're doing great. What is it? I can't sleep. She'll get over it. I liked it better when they were small. You were at your mom's yesterday? Antoine? How did you know I was at my mom's? Well, because you got on the bus after me! Did I do something wrong? No, I don't think so. Did you? - Fuck, man! - What's going on? It won't stop! The screaming won't fucking stop! Antoine, did you take something? - We have to go to the hospital! - No! Fuck! Let me off! Come on! What's the matter? Fuck, stop the bus! Are you OK? Open the door! Laurence? "Melancholy," or melancholia in Latin, is derived from Greek. The word is made up of "melas," meaning "black," and "khol?," meaning "bile." So, etymologically, "melancholy" means "black bile." This brings us to Humorism, which dates back to Antiquity. Can anyone tell me who originated the theory? No one? - Yes? - Hippocrates? Hippocrates, very good. Hippocrates, some 400 years before Jesus Christ, was the first to clinically define melancholia. Like the four elements, he felt the human body was made up of four humours. Hi! Hi! - I brought you a bag of rice. - OK, thanks! Well, come in. I thought you'd like it. I buy a bag at the Chinese grocery at the start of every term. It's a good deal. That's really nice of you. - You want a beer? - Yeah. - Here. - Thanks. Are you hungry? I have some rice. Should we skip philosophy this morning? Yeah. - Ready? - Oh yeah! Three, two, one, go! - Are you trying? - Yeah, you? - David, your back! - My back's fine! - I'm rooting for Dad! - You little brat! Are you trying? - Victory! - Yeah, yeah. - It's just because I'm drunk. - So am I! Son, your turn! - Ready? - Yeah. - You sure? - Yeah. Three, two, one, go! - You've gotten strong! - I know! The student has not surpassed the master! Nice one, Dad! You always win at everything anyway. You make the marionettes. You have your family, your lovely girlfriend, your beautiful kids. Dad left you his tools. OK, calm down. Before he hung himself, Dad thought: "I'll leave my tools to David." He doesn't need them. He has everything. Are you done? What would you be doing if it wasn't for me? What the hell are you talking about? Any other boss would fire you, Andr?. You're always late, and you're hungover three quarters of the time. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. Well then, I quit. You're good at that. I let you win! You often said: "I'm not made for this world." I would reply: "This world isn't made for you." But if I had known that the world would spit you out so fast, that you'd wash up on the icy shore, mad and alone, I would have said: " Come. "Come, let's live together before you die a little." I would have said: "Antoine, let's smoke all the cigarettes. "Light the next one with the one we're smoking now. "Let's smoke in our tiny, windowless room. "Let's ruin our little teenage lungs." If I had known, I would have said: "Let's kiss, Antoine. "Put your tongue in my mouth. "Let your saliva drip down my smoke-filled throat. "Let's kiss boldly, "like we shouldn't, given we're still children. "Fine, I'll show you my breasts. "Let's go travelling, do some winter camping. "Let's make friends to invite over for fondue. "Let's be a couple "and make children who'll smoke too. "And quickly, let's grow old, "be serene like those who have lived a lot "and no longer fear anything. "Let's calmly remain side by side, far from any storm. "Gently place your wrinkled hand on my slender thigh, "and let's wait for the end, resolutely, together. "Let's live a whole life before you die a little. "Let's grow up before you go mad." Bravo! Three more hares, gone from this earth, woman! You feel guilty, don't you? Three poor beasts taken in the prime of life by my hand! - It's a cruel world, my love. - Indeed! Come here. Careful with my hair! Don't pull out what's left! Laurence and Fred are all right, aren't they? Of course they are. They're doing well. Are Fred's grades good? Yes. He brought them up on his last report card. He worked hard. Do you think he'll move to Montreal too? I don't know. I hope not. Me too. They're all grown up. - Hi! - Hey, Laurence! What are you doing here? Marie! - Hi! - Hi! Hi, Mom! - Why are you here? Are you OK? - Of course! I missed you! What a nice surprise! I'll go get Fred! - I hope you didn't hitchhike. - Never, Mrs. C?t?! - It's nice to see you! - You too! Let me take your bag. Have a seat! - Go get Fred. - Yeah. - OK, F?lix, listen to this. - No! Laurence, he has a right to know! I was in Grade 2, and Laurence was in Grade 4. It was the Christmas play. Fred, you're mean! I'd been chosen to play the wise man with the frankincense. Guess what Laurence's part was. What was it? Laurence was the ox! - That's all right, my love. - No, wait! The ox costume was for two kids, and Laurence was chosen to play the rear end! - So you were the ox's ass? - Yeah, I was! Fred, you're ruining my relationship! No, I love you even more! Do you remember how much she cried on the way home? Yeah, I remember. - Everyone laughed at me but you. - No, I laughed. I just hid it well. All right... I think Dad's going to play us his biggest hit, everyone. That's right. I planted an oak tree At the edge of my land I toiled for days Will it stop my pain? I planted an oak tree At the edge of my land Will it stop my pain? Will it grow at all? Love and hate Are my two children They are my chains Will it stop my pain? Love and hate Are my two children Will it stop my pain? Will it grow at all? That song is still as beautiful as ever. Without it, you might not be here today. Well, I would be! Are you in love with F?lix? I think so! Why do you love him? He's handsome. He's funny. He's smart. Those are good reasons. He's a good guy. You chose well. Fred told me he'd help you out in the workshop. Yes. There's a little rush before Christmas. Andr? won't come back to work with you? I don't think so. I feel bad that things turned out this way. What was that lamp you were using yesterday? Your mother got it. It's a sun lamp. - What's it for? - To make me sunny! I always feel tired in the fall. It's supposed to help. - Are you OK? - Of course, Laurence. Don't worry. I'm just looking forward to spring. Your piece that you read at the assembly... was one of the most beautiful things I've ever heard. I'm proud of you. - Bye, F?lix. - Bye. - Safe travels. - Bye, Dad. I love you, Laurence C?t?-Leblanc. I'm totally in love with you. Really? I want to spend my life with you. Me too! David! Your vest! Thanks. I forgot. Bring me back a hare for supper, man. Yeah. - See you later! - See you later. MARIE, FR?D?RIC, LAURENCE, I LOVE YOU, BUT THE WEIGHT IS TOO MUCH TO BEAR FORGIVE ME. DAVID. David Leblanc. It's been about an hour. Yes, but he left a note. Dad! He'll come back. So? - Fred, come here! - No, I'm going back out to look! I'm going to miss him! I don't want this! I'm sorry. There's nothing, Laurence. I looked everywhere. Why'd he do it? I don't know. Why'd he do it? I really wish I could tell you something, but I don't know. - Is it OK if I smoke in here? - Of course. Check it out! - When did he make this? - I don't know. I'm gonna keep it, OK? Goddamn fucking idiot! Sorry, kids. Your father loved you, OK? He loved you too. - How are you? - I'm OK. Are you working hard at school? Hard enough. I came here to tell you something, Grandma. What is it? Grandpa didn't die of a heart attack. He died the same way Dad did. He hung himself in the basement of your old house. Andr? found him. They pretended it was a heart attack with the doctor. And they decided not to talk about it, not to you or to the others. I think Dad would've wanted you to know. I knew, Laurence. I guessed. This has to stop. It's enough. We have to live. Why? To see our loved ones grow older. Laurence, by the time you read this, I hope you're no longer angry with me. I'm sorry I read your diary. But your words are so beautiful, your take on things so moving that I couldn't help myself. I wanted to read it all. I find you and your brother so interesting. I'd like to follow you everywhere and see you all the time, see you try, see you fail, see your pain and yourjoy. But I know that I can't. You're both so beautiful. You have your whole lives ahead of you, and that's wonderful. I'd like to live forever and watch you until the end. I live through you. You can write, Laurence. I promise I'll only read with your permission in the future. I love you. Make a wonderful life for yourself. David. Laurence! How are you? Good! - You went on a trip? - Yeah! It's good to see you! Come on! - Here, this is yours! - Thanks! You're not dancing! Come on, dance! What's this? It's a tape of my dad's. - This was David's, wasn't it? - Yeah. - Did it attract them, at least? - I don't know. I don't think so. Translation by Joshua Beitel Subtitling: CNST, Montreal
