...is looking for an answer to this question. What happened exactly... F16 fighter jets are flying low... -İstanbul Municipality is occupied... -...coup plotters... Atatürk Airport... We're sharing the latest news with you. Come on, lads! Come on! Bürküt team, get your APC from the garage. Anyone returning to HQ, come with ammunition. ASAP. Don't forget the night vision goggles. It'll be a long night. Take loads of ammo. Out. Copy that. Spare a few com devices for support troops out of Ankara. ON THE NIGHT OF 15 JULY 2016 MEMBERS OF FETHULLAH TERROR ORGANIZATION WHO HAD INFILTRATED THE STATE’S SECURITY FORCES WAGED WAR ON THE TURKISH POLICE WITH TURKISH ORDNANCE. THE LOCATION THEY TARGETED WAS A DEPARTMENT THEY FAILED TO INFILTRATE FOR A LONG TIME: POLICE SPECIAL OPERATIONS. 51 PEOPLE WERE MARTYRED DURING THIS MALICIOUS ATTACK. BUT SOME SURVIVED. Help me, brother! Now! Check the building! Bring fire extinguishers! Yusuf! Come here! Here! BRIEFING ROOM Help! I'm here. Are you okay? Are you hurt? You're not hurt, right? Don't be scared, okay? You'll be fine, don't worry. Wait for me here. Wait for me. Kaya, don't go. Help me! Help the wounded ones. Help! Zeynep. Zeynep! -Zeynep! -Osman. İrfan! Chief! Chief! Run! Turan! Turan! Ece. Barbaros. We need morphine, Turan. -Are you okay? -Never mind me, I'm fine. Keep pressure here. -I don't know how to do this. -Just keep pressing! He came out of the vehicle. Don't let him stand up, okay? -Don't go! -I'll be back soon. Where's Behçet? Find me the first-aid kit! No! The door is stuck! -The door is stuck! -Baran! Ömer! Push the door! Push it! Push! Asena! Asena! Asena! Asena! -Don't look... -Asena! Don't worry. The state will take care of you now. The state will hold your personal rights until you're 18. You'll have a proper education like your parents wanted. The state will give you an education, take care of you. I have a question, teacher. Yes, sweetheart? What is "the state"? It means The Republic of Turkey. The plane belonged to the state. So, the Republic has to take care of you now. -Why? -What do you mean? Why does it have to? Because the state means civilization, Kemal. 20 OCTOBER 1986 Have you seen hell, boy? No, sir. Hell is between his lips. Hell is not obeying his truth. Act accordingly. Remember! You will never look at him in the eye. Only if he wants you to. -What's your name? -They call me Orphan. He has to travel in two days. This will be the first time you'll see him in person. Listen to him carefully, pay attention to what he's doing. Got it, boy? Got it, sir. -What's your real name? -Tolga, but everybody calls me Orphan. Better. Don't question what he says. Rest assured that he's right in dreams and awakenings. -Okay, sir. -Orphan... He's the only one that will care of you. -Do you understand? -I do, sir. You'll learn your true name now. You'll hear what you have to do. You'll be molded as he says. Is it a good idea to leave Kemal Boratav alive? Everybody will be talking about Turgut Atalay's death tomorrow. We'll say he's the killer. So, Kemal has to live until he's executed. -But, Tolga... -Don't question me. -I see. -Good. Squads with military uniforms will be arriving. They've all been handpicked. They're coming to take Boratav to Akıncı. We know. And we have permission. Send me two armored cars and one tank. We have to reach Gölbaşı. The new General of Special Operations will arrive at 2:00. I'm here, brother. Don't worry, I'm with you. I'm here. I swear to you, they will pay for this. I'm here, sir. Turan. Go and find my daughter right away. I will. Zeynep! Zeynep. Zeynep. Don't cry. I don't feel much. Don't cry. When they ask about me... tell them two things. Zeynep loved Tan. And she belonged to Police Special Operations. Zeynep... Zeynep! Zeynep! Oh Behçet... My son... Turan, go to your daughter. -Chief... -Turan! Brother... Find some morphine for the Chief. Take the wounded out of the flames. -What about the casualties? -We have a mission. Barbaros, please. Chief Behçet is here, Asena lies here. Listen to me. We'll remember, we'll grieve. But not now; we owe them. They're watching us now, to see what the survivors do. Come on, pull it together! Ömer, we need a sturdy APC. I'll take one from the garage. Ömer, find one with a 12.10 turret. Be quick about it! Ece? Ece? -Kaya! -Ece. -Turan! -Kaya! Daddy! -Daddy! -Sweetie! My little lamb! -Are you hurt? -No. God bless you, brother. The Chief is expecting to see everyone with a gun in garage two, come on. -Yes, sir. -Come on! -Are you okay? -How is Ece? Are you okay? Where is Asena? Yes. Locate the civilians in the lodgments. -To the safe ones, okay? -Okay. Sweetie. I have to go now. I'll be back, okay? Don't underestimate him. Orphan told us many times. Where did they send you from? -Şırnak. -How many have arrived with you? Does it matter? I'm here. Excuse us, we just have to make sure. Anyway, take him to Akıncı. Two civilians and I will join you on the road. -What about Turgut Atalay? -What about him? He's still breathing. Impossible. Check his pulse. Too weak. He'll be dead in ten minutes. Let's make sure of that. Pop one in his head. You know where we're going. I do. To hell. Kemal Boratav, Osman Alan sent me. -How can I be sure? -You can't. It's hard to be sure of things now. I have to get to Special Ops HQ. -All my friends are there. -First, we need to get out of here. There's a platoon of FETÖ followers outside. We can't leave Chief Turgut here. He's the first miracle of tonight. Police and Special Operations members, pay attention to me. No Ambulances are coming. Not even the fire department. Because they are afraid. Look. This brother of mine who lies dead over there. Never forget what this man, Behçet Orbay said. Don't mistake brothers for traitors. Bring me a rifle. Chief, but you're wounded. What will we say on the other side? To Kenan Tümer? "Your daughter Asena has fallen, we couldn't protect her. And then just waited." Huh? What about Behçet's son? Am I going to say "I couldn't avenge you father." to him? Load enough ammo to last through the night to the last APC. Come on, let's go. Which team's vehicle is that? Bürküt's. All of them are martyrs now. Aspanda Bürküt, jerde Kökbörü bol. What was that? "Soar like an eagle in the sky, roam like a wolf on the ground." Are there any eagles left in the sky? Sir, are we alone? For now. They have Akıncı. No news from Balıkesir. -How many planes do they have? -Eight, at least. Some are flying low, some are on the hunt. If they have the base in Kızılay they can shoot the president's plane down. I know. You'll go there when the General gives the order, and contact the ground. -What if the enemy hears us? -Let them. Let everyone hear that there are anti-coup jets in the sky. Emrah, do you copy? Yes, I'm listening. Emrah, we are in the dark. We have wounded. We have casualties. The remaining patrol team is scattered in the city. But we have no intel, we're blind. Find us Kemal Boratav, Emrah. They haven't figured us out yet. They don't know that we broke their encryption. We'll get you the intel. But there's something, Chief İrfan. Tell me, Emrah. They are texting about Kemal Boratav and Chief Turgut in Gendarme HQ. They are saying that they're out of action. Ömer. Pull over, turn off the lights. Who are they engaging with? I don't know. DOOR C Rest assured. All these traitors, shooting at their fellow army mates are creeps. They are the ones who planned tonight. But they are not Turkish soldiers. They have never been so. Sir, my name is Kemal Boratav, Police Special Operations. And Mete Sançar, Special Forces. Brigadier Hacıoğlu, welcome. We have Turgut Atalay with us, heavily wounded. He's been shot in the head, we have to take him to a hospital. We'll take him to the hospital, Kemal. Go back to your mission. Sir, we'll leave the rifles wıth you. Your pistols won't be enough for two dozen men. It'll be enough, Kemal. Their lies jailed us for three years. We'll fight them to the death now. Either the state will rule... Or scavengers will win. We have to relay the orders from Special Ops to the combatant teams. Do whatever it takes to help the new appointed General. What about support fire? Here's your support fire. You'll stay between the barracks and the highway. Go home, stay inside. It's dangerous out here. They're shooting at the corps. Dude, the helicopters are hovering above us, I'm starting to freak out. Emrah, nobody knows about you. Don't be so scared. Dude, please. Let me get over there. You think you'll be safer with us? Listen, there are three key points in the city. If we don't clear them, they'll have control over Ankara. First one, Gendarme HQ. General Mustafa Kemal and Harun were fighting the leaks here before the bombing. Second one, Türksat. They need Türksat to stop the state's broadcast. They'll send their most trusted dogs over there. -Third one... -Third one. Special Forces HQ. Will we engage the Maroon Berets? Imagine that they are not Maroon Berets. Give me that. Emrah, anything in the encrypted messages? About Special Forces? The texts convey worry. They couldn't capture General Zekai. He suspected a raid. Left the wedding early. Turan. Remember what General Osman said. They also have men like us. They have men that will never surrender the HQ. They have The Wolf, too. All right then. First stop, Türksat. I don't want to discourage you, but they have tanks and helicopters everywhere. You realize that, right? Deliver us from the evil of your creations from the evil of the night when the darkness falls from the evil of those who whisper with the devil from the evil of jealousy. And give us shelter in the light of dawn. Amen. I won't ask how you are. You look like shit. We are late, General. We are too late. We did not have enough time. The men we have among them tipped us three hours earlier. The bastards acted ahead of schedule, just as were making our move. They also have Erlik. Tolga Erlik? Then they are more crowded than we anticipated. Sir, they seized TRT broadcast. General Mustafa Kemal is fighting against the coup at Gendarme HQ. Where is General Arif? Is he safe? He has Gendarme Special Ops with him. You see, Kemal? The night is young. The real Turkish officers are trying to stop the creeps. Where did they hit? They bombed Police Special Ops. Too many casualties. I'm sorry, son. You know what hurts me the most? It's not Tolga's betraying his comrades of 10 years. It's not that he killed the woman he claimed to love. It was the look on his face while he shot his mentor, General Turgut. He stared at his teacher as if he was looking at an insect. He wasn't really trained by Turgut. -Don't think like that. -I will. -And when I get my hands on him... -What will you do? Will you have your revenge? Will you make him suffer? Take a look outside. If the police and army forces can't put an end to this tonight hundreds if not thousands of civilians will die because of the creeps. This country will turn to a blood bath as their masks begin to slip. Does your revenge matter or the people? Both. Gökçe, we have an order from the General. The Kızılay Air force Base has been seized. The orders coming from the base are illegal and will be discarded. This is Lion Fleet, one, two and four. Combatant jets, Diyarbakır departure, identify yourselves. Dude, identify yourself ASAP. Don't answer them. They are trying to scare us. Sir, I won't leave you with those. I'll be fine, they don't have many missiles. Their target is the presidential plane. -Sir, no way. -Way. But I won't say no if you'd like to take two of them from my tail. I repeat, Diyarbakır departure combatant jets, identify yourselves. Dude, identify yourselves or we'll fire warning shots. Who are you? This is Turkish Air Force, who are you? This is Lion Fleet, one, two and four. Return to base, ASAP. This is your last warning. Lion Fleet doesn't become you. Let's call you Dog Fleet. Next one will be on your fuel tank. Sir, all bark no bite. GUARD frequency. Diyarbakır the 8th Main Jet Fleet. This is Panther Two. -Emergency frequency... -Don't. Kaya, don't answer it. We don't know whose side she's on. This is Gökçe Demir. Remember? From Sur. Chief, I'm sure. She's no traitor. You know she's one of us. Panther Two, this is Wolf. We're listening. Kaya Ülgen? Lieutenant, we're listening. Kaya, I don't have much time. I have FETÖ jets on my tail. Listen to me carefully. They shout down this frequ... Lieutenant? Lieutenant? Chief, the GUARD is an open frequency. They must be trying to relay critical intel. We'll try to reach them from Türksat. Chief, you might have internal bleeding. -Let us lead the way. -No way. We'll be side by side all night. Such stubborn men we are. Not as much as Tan but... He is the most, ever. Don't worry, he'll walk again. I'll make his prosthesis myself. We'll divide in three groups. Turan, Kaya. Ömer, Baran. Barbaros and me. If I lose consciousness, Barbaros is in command. -God forbid, Chief. -We won't stop! Martyrdom is key. Keep on, hide in the HQ building. Keep out of sight and wait. We'll be on alert here. That's the pulse of the country, Kemal. They are so full of themselves they sent a creep to order the combatants around. Those fake orders must not reach their destinations. If they do, all the officers and civilians that are aware of them, like General Ümit in İstanbul and General İsmail Metin in Van will be ordered to be killed. Even if they don't succeed they'll cause chaos in the army with fabricated news. They'll mix the lies in the truth. -Sir, let's do something. -Not yet. We'll wait. They couldn't capture General Zekai. -We'll trust him. -What can one man do? That one man will do what has to be done. Just one man can change everything if his heart is set on the truth. Aren't those men the people who saved nations for thousands of years? We always had people trying to ruin our country. And always will. But also lonely heroes like you who defy death to stop these people and make history. Sir, we heard gun shots in the barracks. Stand by until Colonel Erdinç makes contact with you. Roger that, sir. This place is important to them. They'll protect it like a carotid artery. Let's contact our guys. Special Ops will support us. There's a jamming relay that protects Special Forces from intruder attacks. First, we have to shut that down. Where's the relay, sir? Over there. I have an idea. Turan. We've reached the casualties. They shot up the whole vehicle. They must've acted as real heroes. I hope to God that there are creeps in there. -Turan. -I want whoever is left alive. Won't we avenge our casualties? Not yet! We're hungry for the intel right now. Act with your brain, not your emotions. -Chief... -Turan! Bury your emotions deep. That's the only way, trust me. If we want to survive tonight we must go numb. Stay where you are! Hey! Stop! What are you talking about? Orphan's been calling you for hours. He's all riled up as it is. Don't you hear the shots firing? Look at me. They need reinforcements at the main gate. They sent me to guard the jammers. Move there right away, don't get us in trouble. If he asks, I'll tell him that I told you. I don't want to get on his nerves, I'm sorry. His bright blue eyes turned all red, I swear. Move it. You have talent, Kemal. Tolga's strength is also his weakness. We know him as well as he knows us. -Mete. -Yes, sir. Enter the jammer building. Now. Still quiet. Why isn't there anyone here? Weren't creep teams dispatched here? Clear. What do you see? There's no one around. They gunned down everything to cut all communication. The place is torn apart. They bombed the large antennas. Okay. Go on. Is there a way? Yeah. -Come on. -Kaya. We'll bring the backup transformer. Connect the field radio to the antennas on the roof. Roger that. When did you learn how to use the field radio? Murat taught me. Murat the Bear. He couldn't live to see this day. Yeah. But he's watching. He's seeing us now. Rest assured. -Barbaros, we're at the gate. -Copy that, give me 30 seconds. Shame. All this agony... All this corruption... You remember what I told you when we first met? Protect. Protect the Turk. Turk is fighting against Turk now. Don't be stupid. What do you mean? What if they are born Turkish? They're shooting their own people. They can't die as Turks. What about the people who are just following orders? How many will suffer with no knowledge? Everywhere is full of lies. First things first, we must rescue the truth sullied by the creeps. We have to defeat the dark. Kaya, you have to connect right away. They'll send a jet if they see the light. -Chief, this is not a jet. -Not understood, repeat. That's not a jet. Chief! Everyone in the APC! Hurry! Kaya, come on! In a second, almost got the line. Kaya can you see what's coming? Be careful. Let it come. What the fuck are you talking about? I connected our line to the GUARD. We'll hear them, too. -Kaya, get here right now! -Chief, buy me a minute. Please! Chief, this armor won't stop 20 millimeter bullets. There'll be too many canister shots in there. Ömer, you need to step up! I'll drive like a king. Panther fleet, this is Wolf. Do you copy? Lieutenant Gökçe, this is Kaya. Do you copy? Kaya, I read you loud and clear. Wolf, traitors are monitoring air traffic from the air base in Kızılay. We have to neutralize there, they have no back up. This is the most important counter attack in Ankara. I repeat, the most important operation in Ankara. Why so important? Kaya! Why so important, Lieutenant? The Presidential plane is in the air. Its transponder is traceable. We have to blind them. If we don't... Go to operations base, find Colonel Alper. I repeat. Go to operations base, find Colonel Alper. I may lose communication. I'm in a bit of a mess. So are we. Aspanda Bürküt... Jerde Kökbörü bol. Fuck! Let them face us from the front! Come on you fucking bastard! Come on, Kaya! Kaya, move! Ömer, now! Ömer, get us the hell out of here! Move! Did they receive the order? GUARD disconnected but they have the order. Are you sure? I am, sir. Special Ops don't half ass anything. I hope you're right. The ones on my tail disappeared. Mine too. I think I know where they are headed. We didn't see it, it came like a shadow. Did we promote you too fast? Is that why you're so incompetent. -Excuse me? -Excuse you? A single guy passed through 20 men with rifles and shot Semih. -And you couldn't stop him, right? -We did. -He lies a few yards away. -You didn't stop him. You made him a legend. Listen to me... No, you listen to me. That sergeant lying over there stopped us from following our orders. Special Forces still answer to General Zekai and the Government. -We have no authority left. -Who do you think you are? I'm the will that brought you up these ranks. They'll try to take this place back. What do you want us to do? You'll turn the HQ into a fortress. Why are you here? Your man told me to come here. The blue eyed one. Everyone to the jammer building! Bring me whatever's left. The jammer is off, Sir. Lines are open. General Erdinç and the others are meeting. Okay, you stay here. We'll go. They're coming. Go faster! I'm doing my best. I'm not chased by a helicopter every day. The turret's not turning. I'll be at the front! Barbaros! Hold on tight! Go! Go! Call your guys when you change location. Tell them to meet us at Gölbaşı gas station. Sir, we can't hold off the tank with rifles. We'll try. Sir, Sergeant Ömer shot the creep then he was killed. -Where? -At the gates, alone. It's ringing. Chief, he's a little further but still in pursuit. Who is it? -Hello? -Turan? It's Kemal! Bro! Hello? Wait, I'll put you on speaker. -Where are you? -Never mind us, where are you? Turan answered, sir. Speak, Kemal! Who's alive? Turan, who's alive? Hello? Kemal, it's Kaya. Don't worry, we're fine. -Where are you? -I'm with Terminator. General Osman, it's me, İrfan. Happy to see you're alive, Chief. -They tried, General. -İrfan... We're in a tough spot, need back up. Where are you? At home, we'll take it back. -Is it urgent? -Very. We'll be there in an hour. We'll meet at Oğulbey. But we need ammo, İrfan. Can you repeat that? -Didn't copy. -We need ammo. It's urgent. Come on, Ömer! Come on, son! Hello? Chief? Hello? They have a portable jammer for cellular phones. They'll surround here. Mete, stay in HQ zone once you leave here. -We'll fight, sir. -I know. And even die. But that's not the issue. We have to win tonight. You're our secret weapon. They want the building intact. That's why they're surrounding it. I wish that tank had fired. We'd have an exit. Mete, can we tap into the radio frequency? We can, I can scan for the channel. Sir? Do it now! I know you can hear me. I never told you this. Even Turan doesn't know. I'm an orphan, too. I was a little kid. My mom and dad's plane crashed in a forest outside Paris. They hid it from me for months. I also had no one. I grew up all alone, too. Never trusted anyone. Couldn't. But I've never been a crook, Tolga. I didn't betray my country to a cult. Shut that line off. We can't, we need the line for communication. I had two things even if I felt all alone. My country. And my friends. They thought I was a loveless man. Only I knew the storms in me. Shut that line off! Years passed, my friends became casualties one by one. I wanted to cry but couldn't. I felt proud while the woman I loved was carrying out missions. Also felt afraid. Shut up, Kemal. You never lived any of that, Tolga. You planned deaths of those who once trusted you. You killed Kenan Tümer, my second father. You executed your own mentor, Chief Turgut. I wonder how many soldiers’ blood is on your hands from Gölbaşı. I don't care, Kemal. I know. That's why I'll hunt you, like an eagle hunts a fox, Tolga. The jamming relay will collapse if we destroy that building. Let it. Get ready. I'm ready, Kemal. Come please! Last 50 bullets! Last 50 bullets! Asshole won't give up! -Should I go into the city? -No, we can't risk the civilians. -Ömer, drive to Pursaklar. -What? There's a tunnel. Hold on tight! They're saying prayers for the dead. From where? Everywhere, the whole city. -For whom? -For the country. Turan, stop that. Ömer, Baran. You're coming with me to Kızılay HQ. As Gökçen said, we'll help them to shut down the transformer there. We'll tag the helicopter along with us. What about us, Chief? You three go support Kemal. Take the long range rifles. If we don't see each other again know this each and every one of you is a son to me. No matter what happens, Turkey will be proud of its police. Don't let me down. Let me have your blessing, İrfan. You have it, lad. All of you have it. Come on. -Brother... -Be careful. Be careful, Barbaros. Guys, our mission is to keep this chopper on us. -Baran, fire away everything. -Yes, sir! If anything happens, say the state borrowed it. No problem, bro. Bro, I had a flag there. Can you pass it? -Where are you off to? -We'll go to the center. -Okay, be careful. -Don't worry, we'll be fine. The people are fighting as we are. Baran, listen to me carefully. These helicopters usually fly in pairs. One swoops in and fires, as it pulls up the other one starts firing. So they protect each other. But this asshole is flying solo. His weakest spot will be when he pulls up from firing. How can I do it, if you couldn't? You can do it. I have faith in you. Make me proud. Turan, go to the gas station in Oğulbey. Give them all the ammo you have. Yes, Chief. Dad? Barbaros? Son? Where are you? Are you okay? I heard Gölbaşı was bombed. We're fine. It's fine. We're dealing with the traitors. How are you doing? We heard about the bombing. Whole block ran to the streets. Dad, are you crazy? With a wheelchair. Especially tonight? Go back home, please. I'm wearing the legs you made for me. -For the first time. -Dad, what are you talking about? The prosthesis. Dad, I got it. Okay. But please go back home. Barbaros, I am not telling you... What aren’t you telling me? Are you listening to me? I’m not telling you not to mess with the enemy. -Dad, please. -Am I, Barbaros? No, you're not. You're not saying that, Dad. Because my son is in Special Ops. Who will, if he doesn't? You dad is an ex-soldier. I fought in Cyprus. I'm a civilian now but can't I wave my flag against those FETÖ vermin who are abusing my beloved uniform? Barbaros, listen to me. I'm proud of you. I always am. Because my son is a hero. And my dad, too. I have to go now. Give me your blessing, son. Dad? Dad? Dad? Can you hear me? Dad, I can't hear you! Talk to me. Dad? You have it. Waving now in drawn out winds... The dove of peace, the eagle of war. My dear flower that blossoms up high. I was born beside you, beside you I will die. Is he on the bridge? You want to call someone in Istanbul? Pick him up? Don't you know how he is? No one can keep him away from there. My dad is a soldier, Kaya. A true soldier. A-02, fuel plane. You took off without permit. Return to your base immediately. Otherwise, you'll be engaged as an enemy. Who are you? Identify yourself. This is Diyarbakır departure, Panther Two. Return to base immediately. Did not copy. Please repeat. They're pretending not to hear me, sir. Be careful. Gökçe, there's a missile lock on you. Make evasive maneuvers, ASAP. -Negative, sir. -Gökçe! Diyarbakır, Panther Two. Break away from the fuel plane. -This is your last warning. -Or what? You'll get a missile in the head. What are you doing, Gökçe? Sir, we have to stop the other jets from refueling. Whatever the cost. Panther Two, break away! What are you doing, Panther Two? I'll blow your fuel plane to bits the second you fire at me. What do you say, A-02? You think I'll miss from this distance? Have you gone mad? I'm carrying 100 tons of jet fuel. Great. They'll watch you shoot like a star. Morale will rise on the ground. Panther Two, you'll kill us both. I'm ready for it. What about you? Lion One, we don't have time for this. We'll refuel at Akıncı. You'll pay for this when the night's over, Panther Two. Fuel plane, return to Adana base. Right now. Do not fire. I'm returning. We bought half an hour for the ground team. Any news from Kızılay? Not yet. Come on, Wolf. -Slow down. -What? We have to play bait, or I won't be able to shoot it. Chief, he's gone mad. İrfan, this is our only chance to shoot him! Ömer, slow down for God's sake. Do it, Ömer. Do it! Come on! Not yet! He's coming down to fire! Not yet! -Come on! -Not yet! -Come on! -Come, come, come here! Come! Now! He's running. You got him! Run you fucker! Are you good? The armor is pierced but the engine will hold, Chief. Baran... -I'm out of ammo. -Never mind the ammo. Is everybody okay? Well done, son. Are you okay? Go on, I'm fine. Come on, Ömer. Is it here? We're here. The gas station in Oğulbey. We're back together. Wait here. Talat, Güngör, with me. Who are the casualties? We'll talk later. Turan, I'm tired of keeping things inside. Tell me. I have to know. Or I'll go crazy. Too many casualties. We lost three, four squads. We couldn't even locate some. Behçet died. Zeynep. Her, too. Tan was heavily wounded as we left. Where's Asena? Turan, where's Asena? She's dead. I couldn't do it. Her father entrusted her to me. I couldn't tell her one last time. Couldn't tell her that I'd always love her. It was impossible, but I had a little hope. I hoped that maybe she'd smile one last time. Remember the good times not always the bad. Kemal. What's left? -What? -Your friends. Our country. Kemal. All of those traitors will pay. All of them. Yes. But Tolga first. What are you saying? Why Tolga? He knew you were going to get bombed. He knew Asena would be bombed. He sold all of you out, that infiltrator bastard. Tolga first. Wait here. Yes, Chief. Identify yourself! İrfan Aladağ! Chief of Police Special Operations. -Colonel Alper? -Yes, Chief. -Did Eskişehir reach you? -Yes, we're here to help. Thank god. They barricaded the door ahead. The General sent five trusted men. We have to shut that transformer down or... I know, we will. Sir, two jets from Panther fleet prevented the refuelling of traitor pilots. But the enemy is headed to Akıncı to refuel. How long does it take from Kazan to İstanbul? 10 minutes. Ömer, Baran. Ömer. No! No! What happened? I'm sorry, Chief. Why are you apologizing, son? Take Baran to the hospital, Ömer. Chief, I can't abandon the mission. Guys, we have four more men inside. We have the firepower, that's not the issue. The people are starting to fear the uniforms. You'll be enough, Chief. There's no shooting, you hear? I can manage with one eye. Don't die on me now, Ömer. Do you understand? Don't die on me. I don't have any tears left. Promise me. I promise, Chief. But anyway, give me your... It's yours! You have my blessing a thousand times. Come on, hurry. Come on, lads. Hurry up! The training team in Kırşehir is coming to help us, sir. We will have allies like Lieutenant Mete on the inside. Erdinç. I want to speak to the boys, if you don't mind. If you can bear a grumpy retired officer for a minute. You never retired in our hearts sir. Please go ahead. I commanded some of you. Some of you I'm seeing for the first time. You've spilled blood together. You've hidden your pain together. We can't repay any of you. While you were fighting the enemy out there they hid the dogs that infiltrated our ranks! They blinded the once vigilant eyes. -How are you, İsmail? -I'm crying on the inside, sir. So are we all. We have so many police and Special Ops casualties... Civilians are still being killed out there. Sergeant Ömer. Our Ömer, the one we all know was martyred there just now. I can see the sorrow and the hate towards the people responsible for tonight. But that is not your mission! Our mission tonight by the order of General Zekai is to go and take that HQ back! Most of you have pistols and hunting rifles. They will have helicopters, tanks, heavy ordnance. But whatever the cost may be we will either take it back or die trying! We have raised many great heroes. And all of them will salute Ömer tonight! Because he has fallen in battle for the honor of this HQ! So that they could not park dump trucks or buses in front of there, too. To let our people know that the building has not been left alone he is lying there all alone! He's not alone, sir. Isn't he? -Isn't Ömer alone? -No! So go and claim him! AIR FORCE We have to enter the building. How can we know who you are? Don't you see the uniform on me? Guys, this is the Chief of Police Special Operations. We have to go in. Colonel, how can I trust anyone? You should've taken you uniforms off if you're here to help us. Take them off? Do you hear what you're saying? Listen to them. Brother. That uniform was drenched in blood in Çanakkale. It saved allies risking their own life in crossfire, in Korea. It protected the innocent in Cyprus. In the Southeast, it was torn, pierced by bullets but stood still. Was jailed but never went silent. Was wronged but never betrayed its country. The one wearing it fell but the uniform was folded and kept. I'm a Turk. I am the soldier, I am the police. I am the people. I won't let the mud from tonight soil the Turkish uniform. Now. Let us pass. Make way! Send us a doctor now! Brother. Wait! Wait! It's full of wounded in there. Hang on, keep him still. We can't, send a gurney! Be quick! Ömer, Ömer. Think about it. A poor Zaza boy, no father. Grows up in the slums of İstanbul. Instead of becoming a lowlife meets a brilliant man like you. -Me? -Yeah, you of course. You used to carry a knife with you. We were scared of you. You used to play under that awning in the block. Those frog toys you had... -Ninja Turtles, they were Ninja Turtles. -Turtles, yeah. Right. We were poor, couldn't play with you. I used to watch you from afar. But my softhearted friend came to me. You gave me your own toy. Remember what you said? "Take it, I have more." Right? You remember? Hey! Speak! Look at me! When I was a rookie Murat told me to run fast like Baran, be cool like him. You were a tiny dude. I didn't understand how you ran like that with those legs. Listen. I didn't have a father but I still grew up in a family. And I had the best brother, right? I'll tell Murat when I see him. I'll say "Ömer is cool, too." Where's that stretcher? Colonel, the breaker is locked. I found these in the stores. We'll have to break it with a hammer. -What is it, Chief? -Never mind. -Mete, are you ready? -Ready. We'll cover when you enter the tower. I'll be in the first team that goes in. Mete, Niyazi and İsmail will cover suppressing fire. God speed us all. -Give us your blessing, Osman. -You have it. Remember, history is watching us. Guys. Bullets will rain on here once we go in. Run for the covers. -You'll be out in the open. -Don't worry about me. I'll keep them distracted. Are we ready? Mete, go! Go! Surrender! It's not worthy of us, killing each other like this! This is our home! It's our HQ! Get the hell out of here! Helicopters are coming! They'll blow you to pieces! İsmail. Go on! Go! Go! Mete! Now! Yes, sir. I'm climbing the tower. Cover me. BREAKING NEWS What will we do? What did he tell you? You must know what to do. The civilians won't stop, things will get heated. It's fine. As long as we hold here and Akıncı and if the jets do their part the foreign intervention will arrive. What about us? We'll be long gone. Call a chopper. We have to break the backup generator, too. Sir, they shut it off. Right on time The President is approaching İstanbul. Counter attack F-4 jets are taking off from Eskişehir. I'll cover them. Mete, situation report! Sir, all of our teams are inside engaging the enemy. But a tank is approaching the gate. Repeat, Mete. Did not copy. A tank, sir! Their reinforcement is coming! Sir, is there any anti-tank ammo in the HQ? Yes, we call it the rainy day armory. The leaks had all the rooms sealed that's the only one left. It's a bunker at the lowest level of the main building. Get out! Mete, you have to cover us. Wait, I'll throw a smoke grenade. Now! -We can't pierce it with bullets. -What then? Do you have a hand grenade? Yeah. Give it to me. Turan, I need a rope or wire or something. Wire or rope... Wire. Surrender! We must be the only people to blast open an armory. Hold that. We also check gas leaks with a lighter. Okay, go. Kaya. Kaya, are you okay? Kemal. I saw Tolga. He's taking the creeps to the helipad. Kaya! Found it. Worst student of the academy, -listen to me carefully. -Tell me. Look, this is a semi-automatic wire controlled missile. We'll carry it together, set it together. After we set it up you'll distract the tank. -What?! How will I do that? -I don't know, man. Find a way. Listen. I'll be out in the open. If the tank sees me we'll waste our only missile. I can't do it without you, Turan. BAŞİKA FLAG Don't worry about it, bro. I'll die if I have to. Look here! What is it? Huh? Thought you could intimidate everyone? Then what happened? We are not scared! We fought. Kaya. He's mine. Just keep that chopper from landing. Are you sure? I surrender. Have you lost control? You surprise me, Kemal. You too, Tolga. I thought you read Machiavelli. Never leave your nemesis wounded but alive. I'd say shoot but you can't kill me. You have to keep me alive for intel. I've have a life sentence but I'll live. And then what? A phone call from abroad. -They'll let me go. -You want to die that much? I took everything from you, Kemal. Your teachers. Your friends. Even your woman, Kemal. Shoot. Shoot. Shoot. Shoot me. No, Tolga. You'll live. You'll pay. Everyone you know will see what a dishonorable man you are. The families of the police you bombed the families of the civilians you killed will look you in the eyes. You'll ask yourself the same question every single day as you rot away. "Was it worth it?" It wasn't. I’d have liked Asena to live. She wouldn't have wanted you to. He expects absolute obedience as he trains us. You surrender your mind, soul and body to him. But I was in love with Asena. I didn't mean to do it. -It was a mistake. -Is that why she's dead? When I proposed to her yesterday she told me what happened between you two. The baby you lost. She told me your happy old days. She said no, while she blamed herself. A liar knows when he's being told a lie. -Asena said no because... -Shut up. -Because she still loved you, Kemal. -Shut up. -That's why she said no. -Shut up, Tolga! -Shut up! -Because of your insignificant love -she walked into her death. -Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! You know what real hate is? It's not the one you have for me. Living among the people I despise for 30 years. Posing like like one of them. Going to slleep dreaming about the moment you would all die. That's real hate. Delivering innocent little orphans to a deranged imam for 40 years... That's real hate. Real hate is the one we have for ourselves, Kemal. For surrendering your mind to someone else. For worshiping another human. Always being feeling helples... Just like the first day. That's real. The hate for ourselves. Even if I get a life sentence even if you have me rot in a prison I want you to remember that. There's a mirror, Kemal. A broken mirror. I'm your reflection on that mirror. You and me. Dying is easy, Kemal. You can't understand, Turan. Dying is easy. Haven't we seen that? Living is what's hard. Trying to live a decent life in this world of cruelty. That's hard. She was my everything. My last piece of conscience, last piece of hope. I felt peace knowing that I was fighting for her, even from a distance. A part of my soul died, Turan. Nothing matters anymore. Before I had a chance to tell her how I feel she's went away forever. She knew. I'm sure, she knew how you felt. Her lips curled as she talked about you. Asena got annoyed by smart ass Kemal Boratav. She felt angry with herself just because she knew how much she loved you. You remember how she curled her lips? Don't I? My favorite thing. I was never afraid of dying. Everybody dies. We can die in the line of duty as well. That doesn't scare me. But to think that something would happen to you that terrifies me. Listen, I already lost siblings. I'm not going to lose you, too. We'll live. To remind everyone what we lost. "He can't go" the doctors said. Even I couldn't convince them. We were brothers of fate, General. All these years. Iindeed, we were. But I suppose this is the last time I'll see you. Don't say that. Only God knows. My fingers feel weary. I'd appreciate it if you could write for me. Of course, General. Fevzi Pasha, lead them by example. Don't get them mixed up in politics. With your virtue, guide them away from undue ambitions. Of course, rest assured. You, their Field Marshall, should be the one who reads them my letter. They would be proud. To you; whose history and victories start with the dawn of man, You; who have carried the light of civilization, beside every glory. You; the Turkish Army. POLICE Officer. Are you hurt, officer? -Excuse me? -This is the last ambulance. Are you hurt? No, I'm fine. -Thanks. -Recover soon. I don't know why our Chief wanted me to give a speech but I thank him. I'll try to keep it short. As long as my abilities and your patience allows it. If you ask me what Police Special Operations are my answer would me crystal clear. We are the ones who will not surrender this country to the dark. We do not serve one person. We serve this whole nation and what it stands for. While this nation and its values are in danger we can never rest easy. Like that night. While darkness surrounded everywhere these 51 martyrs in these 51 photos never gave up. They're brothers, sisters, wives, parents and children... But before all else, each one of them human beings. With all their flaws and all their perfections, they protected us with their lives. They became martyrs in the name of immortal ideals. But lived for mortal truths. They reminded history once again: We had no fear, and we fought. God bless them. May their place be in of heaven, may they rest in peace. Amen. POLICE SPECIAL OPERATIONS COMMAND No, no, no. I have to do it myself if I want the rehab to succeed. You succeeded anyway, you tricked death. -Still stubborn as a veteran. -Are you telling me? The guys told me what you've done during the night. Old habits die hard. I took her on a trip to Elazığ one time her father was on leave. -We were all there. -Lake Hazar. There were big orange spiders there. All the kids but her were terrified of them. She picked the spiders one by one from the screaming children. Put them away to a safe distance. We failed, Turgut. We failed to protect. When I heard about it a piece of me died with her. I wish we died in her place. I wish we died in Behçet's place. We sacrificed our children to that night. What will we tell her father? When we see him on the other side, huh? "We paid the price and the motherland prevailed." That's not enough. We must also be able to say that these will never happen again. We will. We will also say that the people who did this didn't have a place to hide. You look ugly with a beard, too. Don't be scared, we're not savages. We'll deliver you to the Turkish justice system safe and sound. But I wish you'd make a move for that gun in your glove compartment. -How did you find me? -You thought you were safe in the holes you were hiding in the distant corners of the world. But you're not. The wolf survived the frost. And it won't forget the winter. Don't worry, I won't drive fast. -You still think you're driving? -Oh come on. Then, I got the music. Thank God I came prepared. KING'S MIX Take me around this country. Where do you want to go? Just drive, trouble will find us anyway.
