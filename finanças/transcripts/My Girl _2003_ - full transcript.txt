What's the point of being single? I see all the couples. So full of love and happiness. Kissing each other passionately. When one of them is sick. They care for the other Until they are better. They have many kids. They are the future of the country. Hey, it's 07:00 a.m. We might make it there by noon. It's too late to help him with the ceremony. Can you ask Thoe what else I need to prepare? You will get there before me. The evening party will be held in another hotel. The morning session is a Chinese wedding. I've already taken care of that. Yes. Do you need that, too? TO MR. CHATREE TRAIRAT This guy. He's kind of a shy boy. I didn't think he would be the first one to get married. He's the groom? Yes. When will you get married? - When? - I'm still waiting for the right one. If that woman isn't as good as you, I won't get married. You're playing with fire. Don't you know who I am? - Please wait here for a minute. - Okay. Hello? Yes. I'm picking up the suit at the tailor. I'm serious. I have to try the suit on. I might find my bride at your wedding. Where are you? I'm on my way now. What's the matter? I'm about to hit the highway. I'll be there soon. It's the weekend. You don't work on weekends even if you are in Bangkok. Wrap it up, then. Can't you take a day off to come to your friend's wedding? Even Yong is coming all the way from Surat Thani. Whatever. I'm done trying to convince you. I won't do it for you. Call him yourself. My hands are full right now. I'll call you back. Oh, Mom? I'm not coming home this week. I'm going to Nakhon Sawan. Do you need anything? Noina... I remember her. It's really set tomorrow? I don't think I can make it. My friend's wedding is also scheduled tomorrow. Are you going? Wait, Mom. You should go. Please give her my best wishes. All right. Bye, Mom. We might think some memories have completely faded. The truth is, we've probably just buried them in the deepest part of our heart. If we dig deep enough, we might realize that we've been carrying them our entire life. I'm not talking about literally digging. SAO, SAO, SAO - DOOR OF MY HEART It can be like just listening to a song that reminds us of the past. Once again, the memories will be conjured up. Knock knock knock, open the door. To see who's there I'm so fine and happy. Why do I have to Open the door of my heart? Jeab! Jeab! Jeab, wake up. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up, Jeab! The sun is already up. Wake up, Jeab! Take that! Get up. Go take a shower. Go! - Hurry up. - This girl is Noina. - Our friends won't wait. - She's my childhood friend. - Noina, come here. - Come here. - Come here, honey. - Noina, come here. - Noina, come. - Let's play with Jeab. - Let's play with Jeab. - Come here. Come here. I was born a few seconds after her. But it turned out that she was born in the Year of the Tiger and I was born in the Year of the Rabbit. My house was in the shrine area where there weren't a lot of boys unlike in the market area. Noina was the only kid who's the same age as me. She was bigger than me. My Lady. Shall we go to a romantic dinner? - I would love to. - I would have to play. - Where are we going? - Anything that she wanted. Otherwise, I had no one to play with. I'll go wash and change. I'll be waiting for you here. Don't peek! What sane person would want to do that? Noina was good at everything. - Two, three, four, five. - Nobody could beat her at jump rope. Eight, nine, ten. She even got the nickname Master of Jumping. CHARNKESA All done. My house was a barbershop. My dad had owned the shop for over a decade. Half of the men in our village, - both young and old, -Next, please. Had been my dad's customers. SAMAI BARBER Noina's house was also a barbershop. I'm hungry. Do we have anything to eat? You're always hungry after playing. All right. All done. Noina's dad was a painter before he became a barber. The other half of the men in our village were his customers. Next, please. My dad's signature style was using a comb with the hair clipper. As a former artist, Noina's dad had to create a mood before cutting customers' hair. His trusty tools were scissors and a comb. All done. Wait. All done. Next, please. Even though they used different tools... - A bottle of Coca-Cola, please. - Okay. Next, please. ...the results were pretty much the same. - A bottle of Pepsi, please. - Okay. The thing was, their barbershops were separated by just one shop. They didn't get along very well. They didn't want to share customers. Each believed their talent was greater. Charn, I would like to get a haircut. My hair grows really fast. Hey, didn't you go to that barbershop last time? You know, I don't like sharing customers. My dad always got sulky whenever his customers went to his rival. Noina's dad was exactly the same. Samai, a little trim at the back like last time. I'm not in the mood right now. My mom told my dad that people don't cut their hair just once their whole lives. They would get a haircut every time their hair grew. There was no use in being mad. WENT OUT FOR A HAIRCUT. WILL BE BACK AT 04:00 P.M. Hey! Downtown. Even though our dads hated each other, our moms were best friends. What's the matter? You look so tired. It's my husband. He kept me up all night. Jeab is not a little boy anymore. But your husband still does it? It's getting worse! He's keeping me up until the break of dawn. Everybody thinks that my mom is gentle. You little rat! The bath is for bathing, not for playing! But she was so harsh with me. You played in the bathtub? He always says I'm complaining. - She complained a lot. -But he won't clean if I don't complain. She complained about anything. From insignificant things to the really big issues. Where are you going? To play with Noina. The playground is just around the corner. Why aren't you walking there? Don't go to the market area. There are many cars on the main road. Dang's grandson, Goh, got hit by a car yesterday. Jeab! Did he hear what I said? If he gets hurt, I'll punish him. He is as stubborn as his dad. You guys never listen to what I say. I never went to the market area by myself. But that day, my mom's complains made me want to do it. A boy got hit! - A boy got hit. - Let's go see. - The car hit him. - He got hit. A boy got hit by a car. I never dared to ride a bike across that road again since then. Jeab. Jook said she brought a new toy. - Really? - Let's play with it tomorrow. She already brought it? - Yes. - How many does she have? Let's find out tomorrow. Mom, open the door, please. I'm going home. Bye-bye. My mom was always waiting whenever I got home late. You are home late! - Are you learning your lesson? - She had a stick. Does it hurt? I don't understand why you keep doing this. - Sometimes... -I'll hit you black and blue. I wondered why she hit me. Jeab! Jeab! Wake up. Are you going to sleep for the rest of your life? The school bus is here. Jeab! I'm leaving now! You little rat! Why are you still sleeping? Will you be in bed until the end of the day? Dad, hurry up! I'm going to be late! Hey! Did your dad only pay half of the school bus fee? You get on the bus like this every day. We studied at a school downtown. - Again? - We had to take a bus for ten kilometers. - He woke up late. - Most of my classmates - lived downtown. - His dad dropped him off. So I didn't have a lot of friends. Let's play rubber bands today. I've brought a lot of rubber bands. You're bragging. If you want to play, meet me at the usual place. Okay. I beat the 6th graders yesterday. There was this boy, Jack, from the market area. I got all of his money. What a pity. When I was in 2nd grade... - Nice weather. - Nice weather. ...Jack was in 4th grade. When I was in 3rd grade, Jack was still in 4th grade. Finally, - I caught up with him. -Delicious. - Foods. - Foods. - We eat them. - We eat them. Jack ate anything that was edible. He was the gang leader because he was the biggest. You're awesome, Jack. - Nailed it. - This is Prik. He was my classmate. He was kind of Jack's buddy. Prik really wanted to be a singer. He could sing any song. Jack, a legend like you should challenge the 7th graders. Right? This is Manosh. He was in 3rd grade. Excellent student. Great athlete. - Bad at expressing emotions. -Awesome. This is Tee. He was adorable. What chubby cheeks. So round and smooth. His dad had an icehouse. Tee would help him every day. Move faster! This tiny guy is Boy. Give it back to me, asshole! You asshole! His mom owned the market. - Hello, ma'am. - Hi, dear. What are you buying? - Hello, ma'am. - Hi. - Hello, ma'am. - Hello, dear. Boy always had new toys and bragged about them. Let me watch. - You're so annoying! - Gosh. It's mine! You can't play it if you don't let me watch. What's the problem? You selfish jerk. Give it back to me. Stop playing. You keep hitting my head. Gosh. I can't hit your head? Dammit! You son of a bitch! What did you just call me, you jerk? You're just bigger then me but so what! What's wrong with you? Do you want a piece of me? ANUBAN PETCHABURI SCHOOL - See you at lunch break. - All right. It's eight o'clock. 4TH GRADE, ROOM 1 Let go of me! All right. - One, two, three. - One, two, three. - Four, five, six. - Four, five, six. Seven, eight, nine. Ten. Again? Be more serious, dude. I'll try my best. - I won! - Damn! I almost won. Watch the rubber band jump. I'll beat you this time, Jack. You're dead meat. - I'll beat you. - I won again! I almost got it. I got it! You're playing with the wrong guy. Can I play with you? Okay. Do you have rubber bands? You can have mine for now. Give them back to me next time. He's not allowed to play! Why can't I? Boy doesn't have a pair. I finally won! Dammit! You're so annoying. You're the reason we get to school late and have to rush every morning. You can't play with us. Guys, let's play somewhere else. Jack! Those are my rubber bands. Kick the ball! Tanapon Jaiyen, from 1st grade, room 3, please come see your parents at the Administration Department. What is that? You lost. Go there. Go there. Hey, what is that? What is it? I don't see anything. Jack! Take it! I don't want it anymore. You don't want it? I'll eat it for you then. What are we going to play tonight? Let's play blowing rubber bands again. No. Let's play jump rope. What about acting out Reincarnated? Prik, you'll be Dugu Wu Di. Tee, you'll be the Monk. A handsome boy like me will be Yun Fei Yang. You always win at jump rope. Come on. Let's play family. We haven't played it for a while. Please. Listen, I look the most Chinese, so I'll be Yun Fei Yang. All right. But I will be Mom. I want to be Mom, too. Ngor. What kind of family has two moms? It's okay. I'll be the mistress. - Me, too. - Let me be a mistress. - Please, Noina. - Let me be a mistress. No, that can't be! No one else can be Yun Fei Yang. I suit the role better than anyone. Because I have a sword. No! I won't play if I'm not Mom. Jeez. - Ngor. - What? Do you still have the toy stove? Yes, I still have it. - Bring it with you. - Okay. Why don't we light a real fire? What do you think? I can't play with real fire. My mom will get mad at me. Gosh. - Damn. - You're dead! - You're evil! - Take that! - And that. - Die! You four-eyed jerk! You're a jerk! - Goodbye. - See you. - Let's play cops next time. - See you. - We're having fun. - Which part do you like? I like that part when... I'm sorry. I can't eat your apology! Let's go, Noina. Are you going to leave just like that? I said I was sorry, fatty! Who's a fatty? I'm just a little chubby. Well... And you're in good shape? Big boobs! Save that for your mother! Noina, you idiot! See you later. Good afternoon, Mom, Dad. Hi, son. I'm going out. Don't you have any homework? I'll do it later. If the teacher punishes you for not finishing - your homework... - You'll punish me, too. Jeez. Why are you laughing? - Hey, Pieak, where are you going? - To get some shaved ice. There are a lot of cute girls there. Do you want to come? Die! Damn! Who's there? What are you doing here? I brought the rubber bands. Can I play now? We don't play with homos.

I like it. - I like chicken, too. - Please, Dad. - I don't like it. - I like chicken. - I like chicken. - Please, Daddy. - Jeab. - What? Do you want to make real pastry? Are you allowed to play with real fire? I don't know. I'll ask my mom. What about the others? It's okay. We can play alone. But you have to eat all of them. Okay. Okay? Thanks a lot, Jeab. Bye-bye. Get inside. You're so sweaty. Go take a shower. It's late. Where are they going? This is so annoying. I've been looking for them all day. Really? It's not your business, Chainoi. Aim, take him inside. You came home around drama time again. Do I have to hit you every day? Do I? Why can't you behave like other people's kids? Why can't you be gentle like other kids' moms?

Stay still. - I don't want that! - The wounds won't heal if we don't use this. - Stay still. - No! Jeab! Jack, weren't you too harsh on Jeab? Jack did the right thing. We must give him a lesson or else, he will never learn. Right. If I didn't hurt him, he wouldn't learn. He asked for it. Jeez. Gently, Boy. Guys, from now on, we won't talk to Jeab anymore. Those who break the rules, will be kicked out of our gang. Som, you're it! Hey. Your role is a policeman trying to track down a cruel murderer. All right. So what? I'll be a female police officer. Who will be the murderer? What about Ngor? Jeab. Kick it. I don't care. What other people think of you. I know you. I know the real you. People don't know. That you have a good heart.

I worship. You as a god. How could you hurt me like that? Are you happy. And satisfied now? You made a woman go crazy. Jeab. What happened to your hair? Make it shorter this time. The weather is hot. Samai! You crossed the line. I'm a barber. I serve my customers. But you know that Jeab is my son! It's not my fault that your son didn't want to get a haircut from you.

PETCHABUTI TO BANGKOK I'm going to Bangkok with my friends. I have no homework today. My mom allowed me to go. Get in the car, Jack! Come on, Jack. I've been in love with you so long. We live next door to one another. But the distance is still there I know this is it. But I can't help myself. You're the sky while I'm the ground I'm done. Forget it. Eventually, my memories of Noina began to fade. Jeab. Come on, Jeab. We used to be best friends. We got along so well. Knew each other so well. We were so close. We cherished our friendship. But we had to be apart. We only meet from time to time. We're so happy when we meet. Talking all day all night. One day, we met. You were with your girlfriend. She never left your side. My heart was broken. But I had to force a smile. Concealing my sadness. I just realized that I love you Now, it's too late. We will never be together I'm drowning. In my tears. Jeab. When did you arrive? Why didn't you wake me up? What did you say? I asked you when you arrived. Around three o'clock, I think. Why are you digging through your old stuff? You should get some sleep. I'm going to grab something to eat. You should sleep. I'll cook something delicious for you when you wake up. Hey, I thought you wouldn't come. I changed my mind. Hey, don't cut the hair in the front. - What about the side? - Just around my eyes. Okay. TO JEAB AND FAMILY SUNITA AND ANON 14TH JUNE 2003 I'm going to the market. Do you want anything?
