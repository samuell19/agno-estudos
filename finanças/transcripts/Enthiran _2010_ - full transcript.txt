Hey, Sana. - Do you have a sister? - No. - Mother.. No.. Brother. - What? Well, cousin sister? Can you please shut down your stupid system? Control, Alt, delete. - Get out, you stupid. - Sorry, sir. Don't disturb me. He threw a motor at me, Sana. He said he won't even see Obama. Did you tell him Sana is here? I did. He said to call him later. But he never answers his phone. Tell him. I will never see him again. Hello, world. Oops! Too shrill. Hello, world. Hello, world. Hello, world. Dot. Boys, give him some speech training. I'll be right back. - Okay. - Okay. Hey, pal. Repeat.

This is my hard work of 10 long years. This is not a joke. lf you teach anything like this again, l'll punish you severely. Irresponsible idiots. You fool. You complain against us?

Even though he has been programmed with all the inputs, he is still an innocent machine. Like a new born baby. We need socialize him with the outside world. And see how he uses his intellect and abilities amongst humans. If he can live like them. Once we are sure about this, then we'll take him to AlRD. - You mean, letting him out? - Dot. There'll be a big chaos then. Coming. It's been months. Don't know what's going on. He's spoilt his health doing some research. - Hi. - What's this, Vasi? You look like a hermit. Hi, Father. l have a shocking surprise for you. What is it? Come. What's this? Did you clone yourself? - No, Father. - Hey, what's all this? Who are you? Hi. I am a robot. Speed: 1 terahertz. Memory: 1 zetabyte. He's smarter than you. Father, I made this robot. There are many different types of robots. This is an andro-humanoid robot. A machine that resembles a human. - This is mother. - Mother. Yes, mother. Take mother's blessings. He is a complete human. He does everything a human can. But he can also do what a human can't. Then we don't need these jokers anymore. - Father! - Father! No, Father. I need them. If they are not here, who'll clean up the robot? Who'll make him wear clothes? You're turning an MSC science graduate into a nanny? - Vasi, come and eat. - Yes. Robot, you have a seat as well. Have some steaming hot rice cakes. Looks like you will feed him a gourmet meal, too. Mother, all it needs is 2 units of electricity daily. Why are you talking like that? Haven't you given him a name? Mother, you choose a name for him. lf you had a brother, I would've named him 'Chitti Babu'. Sounds good. We can fondly call him Chitti. Me? Chitti? - Yes. - Yeah. Chitti, go and drop the TV. Oh! Mother, he'll do exactly as told. You should specifically say "switch on the TV". Vasi, are you off to now? Back to lab? No, Mum. I'll get a haircut and then meet Sana. She's very angry. Get in the back. - Who'll drive the car? - Chitti. - Chitti? - Chitti? Oh, God. - Doctor, why take a risk? - And you? I think I've stomach upset, doctor. You go ahead. I haven't told my folks at home yet. You go ahead. Change to driving mode. Watch out doctor. He might break the gear if you don't say it right. - That's why I am here. - Yes, you were there when he broke the TV. Eh, eh! Slow, slow. Just follow my instructions. - Don't do anything without my permission. - Okay, doctor. - Where are we going? - The Park. Hey, hey, Chitti. Idiot. Why didn't you apply the brakes? You told me not to do anything without your permission. - Hey, fool. - New word. Are you driving drunk? No, I'm driving the car with petrol. Don't argue with him. Just drive. Don't cut it too short. - Just quarter inch. - Hello, sir. Good morning. I will cut your hair as neat as a manicure! Hmm. Sir, you didn't come for long time. - Out of station? - No, just work. Is he your brother? Yes, kind of. - Sir, you need a haircut too? - No. This is a wig. Wig? - How old must sir be? - One day. Oh! Sir, that's very funny. Here, some booksfor you to read. Huh? Is he counting the pages? Hhhh, brrr, brrr, brrr, brrr. - Are there other books? - Huh? - You finished reading all of them? - Yes, I did. We only have the telephone directory now. Next. - You finished the directory as well? - Yes. - You memorized all the numbers? - All numbers. - Tell me Kamal Hassan's number. - 24334140. Huh! Oh! Everyone knows that. Tell me my number. - Your name? - Bhajanlal. There are 12 Bhajanlals here. What are your initials? K. Bhajanlal. There are 3 K. Bhajanlals here. What is your address? No. 6, Manna Reddy Street. Chennai. 24884030. Correct. Brilliant. My number is 44433321. Tell me my name. Hello, Mr. P. Pitambaram. - Hi, sweetheart. - Broken heart. - What is it? - I am sorry, Sana. Please, accept my apologies. I was busy in the lab for so many days. You should've stayed there. Why did you come here? I know, you are very angry. How many phone calls? How many SMSs? How many e-mails? I dropped in so many times. You didn't even talk to me. I am tired of all this. Look here Sana. Bullet points: One: I have no clue what's happening when I am at work. - Second: If you knew what I was doing... - Excuse me. I have a class now. Come to Jeeva Park this evening and we'll talk further. Dot. I love you. See you in the evening. Hello! Don't get any ideas. I'm meeting you to end our relationship, not to romance. End our relationship? What do you mean? If we marry, you'll still be with your machines and I will be lonely. Instead of getting a divorce later, it's better to end our relationship now. I'll go my way. You go your way. - So, it's over. - Hey, look. Easy, easy, Sana. Shit! Here's the break-up agreement. All the letters you sent me, greeting cards, the book you had given me. "A briefer history of time". "Freakeconomics". Lord Murugan's photo for Valentine's day. Have you ever given a gift that has touched my heart? This? Who gives a razor as a gift to a girl? - I thought it would be useful to you. - What nonsense! I have returned everything you gave me. Sign this now. Our relationship is over. Goodbye. - That's all? - That's all. - You returned everything I gave you? - Everything. What about my 2 to the power of 9, uh, 512 kisses? You count the kisses, too? Don't you have any feelings? Complete matrix head. I can't return all that. Then the break-up is not valid. Forget it. I won't give it. Then I will not sign it. The break-up is off. What have I gotten myself into? Close your eyes. Count it. What's this? These are post office kisses. Did I kiss you like this? Then what? Pulled you by the waist. Hugged you tight. Stop. Stop. This is impossible. I won't do it. Then the break-up is cancelled. I'll come and bug you every day. You are torturing me. Let everything end today. Come closer. Close your eyes. Don't chuckle. - Is this okay? - Too much gap. Hold tighter. Feel. Feel. Oh.

Oh, oh. - Show me your driving license. - I don't have one. How can you drive without a license? My driving module has programmed. Okay. Don't act too smart. - Follow me to the station. - Which station? Radio station, railway station, space station, or play station? Are you making fun of me? - What's your name? - Chitti. - What's your address? - I only have I.P. address. 108.11.0.1.

No need to argue. Parking offence. No driving license. You talk too much. lf you go to the court, you will be fined 1,000 Rupees. Go to court or settle it here? - I will settle it here. - That's the way. Go on. Done. Hey, are you trying to irritate me? Don't you know what 'settling' means? - Give me a cut. - Where should I cut? Ayeh! Give it in my hand. Aagh! He cut my hand. Police! - Chitti, what happened? - Police. He asked for a cut. So, I obliged. My God. He's bleeding. Vasi, who's this? He looks just like you. Get in the car. I'll tell you. Hey, get the car. Where are you going? Stop! Stop! Is he your brother? Are you twins? No. Drive fast, we'll be in trouble if we get caught. - Is he your friend? - No. Driver? He doesn't look like one. Wait. I'll explain everything later. Hey, look back if he's following us and drive. Huh? Hey, look in the front. Why do you turn your head like that? You asked me to look back and drive. Can't you look in rear view mirror? Why didn't you tell me that? Drive. After publishing hundreds of journal articles, he did a Ph.D. in Carnegie Mellon on Artificial Intelligence and post doctorate in Robotics at Stanford. I've great pleasure in introducing Dr. Vaseegaran, to share with this august audience, his experience with Android Humanoid Robot. Yeah. I think so. Yep. I would like to call my friend,... my brother,... my son, Chittibabu, to come on the stage. Hi. Good morning every body. He's none other than my creation. Chitti, the robot. Speed: 1 Terahertz. Memory: 1 Zetabyte. Gentlemen, he is equal to 100 humans. He has been programmed with the intelligence and skills of 100 humans. He knows all the arts. He knows all the languages of this world. He can dance. He can fight. And he's a sportsman. He's fire resistant, water resistant, in-built vehicle. His eyes are not just to see, but also to show. You can talk to him virtually. This type of robot can develop and protect our nation 100 fold. You are welcome to ask Chitti any question. Simple question. Is "24157817" a Fibonacci number? Yes. It is the 22nd Fibonacci number. By the way, it also happens to be Mr. P. Subramaniam's phone number in Pondicherry. What is the biggest prime number in your opinion? M44. You may have to wait for many years to verify this. Good. Amazing! It's great! Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah nah-neh. Nah-ah-ah-ah-um-uh-uh-mm-mm. What "melody" is this? You started with 'Nat Kurinji' then jumped to 'Husseini' in between. Listen to this. Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah. Ah-ah-ah-uh-uh-uh-mm-mm. You missed the note at this place. Any more questions? Does God exist or not? - What is God? - The one who created us. My creator exists. Dr. Vaseegaran. So God exists. - What else? - Wow, Vasi. He's superb. - What a lovely creation! - Thank you. You are really great. Hey, Chitti. - Do you know to paint? - Yes, I do. - Will you paint me? - Sure. - Whoa! - Smile, please. - Wow! - Wow! - Wow. - Cool. - Wow! - He's such a darling. - Can I take a picture with you? - Sure. - Yes, yes, yes. - Wow. Look, the girls are all over him. Move, move, move. Hi, girls. I am co-scientist. I fixed all of Chitti's motors. - Hi, I am deputy scientist, Ravi. - Deputy scientist? - Yes, that means he's still learning. - Hey. - I dressed him up. - Can I have a date with you? Dating? Why are you all falling for him? He may have the talent of 100 people, but we have a special thing that he doesn't have. No, no, no, no. - Doctor? - Hmm? What is the one special thing they have that I don't? Why didn't you give that to me? - Robo is called Chitti Babu.. - Hey, fools. Don't you know how to talk in front of him? What we meant was we have emotions he doesn't. Don't change the topic. Cheap fellows. - One month salary cut. - Uh! - Hello, Professor. - Brilliant job, Dr. Vasi. Thank you. Chitti, meet Professor Bora. You've told me. Chairman of AlRD. Your mentor. His picture hangs on the wall in our lab. Interesting. Chitti. What processor are you using? Pentium ultracore millennia V2. And your motors? FHP450S motors. From Hirata, Japan. - With harmonic reduction gear unit. - Hmm! Can you tell me about your neural schema? - No, I can't. - Why? It's highly confidential. I am Vaseegaran's professor. - You can tell me. It's not wrong. - I'll have to check. - No. - Chitti... Doctor, he's asking me about my neural schema. - Shall I tell him? - Mmm, uh. You see, professor. You are asking about "know-how". I'm hesitating to divulge information till he is patented. Because he can be easily misused. - I hope you understand. - Of course, I understand. I had just casually asked to see how much Chitti knows about himself. - I hope you don't mind. - Not at all. After I complete my study on him, I will bring him to you. For AIRD evaluation. - All the best. - Thank you. I'll see you there, my boy. Vasi, I like Chitti very much. Can I take him home for few days? Hey, he's not a Pomeranian or your Teddy bear to play with. No, Vasi. I have my final exams. I haven't prepared well as I was upset with you. Chitti can help me if he's around. Please, please, please, please, please. Alright, take him along. You two, go with them. - Okay, doctor. - Okay, doctor. Gents are not allowed in my home. Who said we are gents? Alright. Call me if you have any trouble. Okay. Thanks. Activate command mode and stand up. Command mode activated. Walk. ldiot. Come forward. Not on the side, but straight. - Shit. - l can't shit. Okay, pick up the gun. Not the bun. The gun. Gun. Shoot. Hey! Hey! Stop it! I've programmed you with 800 thousand line of codes. You couldn't even differentiate the gun and the bun. If I tell you to massage my head, you'll probably strangle my neck. Fuck! Vaseegaran is my student, but he achieved it. The robot he created got a standing ovation in the conference. And this nonsensical metal head is still... Strangle the neck. Strangle the neck. - Let go off me. Let go. - Task incomplete. Strangle the neck. Strangle the neck. Strangle the neck. Strangle the neck. Strang... You bas... Shit! Alright, Vaseegaran. I'll surpass you. You just wait. "Happy home". Meaning? Papa was in the army. He died in Kargil war at the age of 40. After that, grief, tears and depression at home. It was horrible. Then we wondered, how long would this go on? Many families became homeless after losing their husbands and sons. We started this home to show them love and care. Nobody can change what has happened. And no-one can prevent what is going to happen. But, everyone can live a happy life now. So, this Happy Home. Latha, is your baby playing football inside? Wait till he comes out. I'll teach him a good lesson. Who's he? What does a man do in our house? Is he your boyfriend? Not boyfriend, Mom. Toy friend. His name is Chitti. He's a robot. Robot? Why are you lying to me? You are too much... It's true. I am a robot. Speed: 1 terahertz. Memory: 1 zetabyte. Chitti, don't scare them like this. Put it back. Mother, you will be amazed by his capabilities. - Can he cook? - Of course. Chitti, cook something for me. I'll take a shower. You neatened my whole room. You're so sweet, Chitti. Thank you. Cool. It's hot. Just one day left. Lots to study. I'll tell line by line what I've studied. Correct me if I'm wrong, okay? Hmm? Finished reading everything? Okay, let me test you. What are monopsychotic and dipsychotic twins? Monopsychotic twins are identical twins. Dipsychotic twins are non-identical twins. Amazing. If you learn at this pace, you will become a doctor in a day. In the important segment of the pelvis are the interspinal's diameters. - The transfer diameter... - Tenciamomo? Tenciamomo is usually the smallest diameter of the pelvis. Anteroposterior diameter. The Anteroposterior diameter, which is through the level of the... They do this everyday. Hello, the music is too loud. Turn down the volume. Hello. We spent a million rupees to buy the deck, amplifier, woofer, and surround speaker. Instead of hearing the full volume, you expect us to use headphones? It's exam time. So many girls are studying. And there are heart patients as well. Heart patients? Ask them to cover their ears with cottons. Don't ask us. Ah-ah-ah. Okay. Hmm? Uh-uh-uh-uh! Yeah! Chitti, can you do something? Don't worry. The remote control uses infrared. I'll handle it. Yoohoo! Yeah. Yeah. Yea... Shit! Whoa! Come on, baby. Come on. - Finish it off. - Shut your ears. - Come on. - Huh. - Okay. - Whoa, whoa! Oh, let's move it. Let's move it. Turn down the volume, buddy! It's too loud, man! - Aargh! - Aargh! Cool. Come, Chitti. Feels good. Back to studies, okay? The Anteroposterior diameter through the level of the spine , which normally measures up to about 11... 98 decibels. Too loud. - Who is that Chellatha? - I can't bear this. Listen. It's too loud. Turn it down by 30 db. Buzz off. It's a feast for mother Goddess. We are celebrating. How dare you're asking us to reduce the volume? I'm having exams. I'm finding it difficult to study. Pray to Goddess and apply sacred ash on forehead, you'll pass the exams. You would do the same when you have a party... Huh?! Sana, the loudspeaker problem is now taken care of. Thanks. Hey, Shekhar. He broke the mike set. Hey, stop. - Come on. - I said stop. Mother... Mother Goddess. Mother... Mother Goddess. Mother... Mother Goddess. Mother... Mother Goddess. What is this? I guess he knows magic. Hey, he took all our weapons. What's going on? Oh, God. Why are you crying, Sana? I'm going to fail, Chitti. I haven't studied anything. I'm running out of time. I feel giddy on looking at these books. Can I take the exams for you? Don't talk nonsense, Chitti? You need a photo lD, exam card and everything. You'll be caught if you go. Then we'll do Zigbee. What do you mean? lf the bleeding starts with the placenta and utero, the fundus of uterus must be grasped and massaged... to make it contract. If the placenta shows sign of separation, it must be expressed by the commonly employed,... Brandt Andrew technique. If the placenta is not separated, no attempt should be made to express it. The third stage of labor starts after the baby's delivery. - and ends.. - Excuse me. What are you doing here? Sana is taking her exam over there. And I'm giving her the answers. How can you tell her from here? I have a built-in data transmitter. There is a trans-receiver attached to Sana's ears. Zigbee protocol. Simple. Is it hi-tech bit? - Not "bit", "byte". - Huh? I've sent 2 megabyte of data so far. Do you see, sir? How they cheat these days? Get up, man. Please, wait. I'll come as soon as the umbilical cord is cut. What? Are you coming with us or you want me to call the security? There! She is Sana. Sana, what is this? Did you use a trans-receiver to get the answers from him? - Who told you? - I did. Who is he? I don't know him. Sana, why are you lying? I'm Chitti. Speed: 1 terahertz. Memory: 1 Zetabyte. What the heck... lt's absolute nonsense, sir. He has lost his mind. I don't have a mind. I have a CPU. Perfect condition. There is no doubt that he is crazy. Take him away. He's wasting my time. When I saw him talking to himself, I assumed he was an ex-medical student. Sir, you may leave now. Go and cut the umbilical cord. Sana, what about the fertilization process? You go out. That's her problem. Task incomplete. Thank you very much. I would've failed if you hadn't helped me. Why are you wetting my cheek for that? Let's go. I'm sorry, Chitti. They would've debarred me for 3 years had I been caught. That's why I had to tell them that I didn't know you. - Don't feel bad. - I have no feelings. I have learned that humans will lie to save themselves. True. Move. Hey, make way. Make way, make way. Clear out. - Clear out. - Wait. - You, get out. - He's the one. - Come on, out. - Take a hike. Hey, are you a big-shot? Answer me! Hey, what are you staring at? You can't attract anything now. Everything's made of wood and stone. - Come on. - Why are they calling me? Keep quiet. Hey, you brought him along for protection, right? Ask him to fight now. Chitti, my purse. My hall ticket and ID is in it. You broke my home theatre. Now, let me see how much noise your home theatre makes. Chitti! Chitti! - Chitti! - Pull her in. Chitti! Chitti, train! Chitti! Beat them up. Chitti! Stop it! Stop! Chitti. Chitti! Chitti! Chitti! You'll be shocked to know what Chitti did today. He is so sweet. He's amazing. Unbelievable. Like.. Like a super hero. If he was a human, trust me, he'll be the best man. - Why do you look irked? - Not at all. Hey. Come on, Vasi. He's just a machine. And the entire credit of whatever he does goes to you. You created him.

Hmm-huh? What is it? You are looking at us as if you are watching some girl dancing. Yeah. And are you going to complain about us too? The AIRD evaluation is tomorrow. I'm troubleshooting peripherals. Hey, are you some scholar? Your language is wrong. As if you are a great Tholkappier. Use right sublime gender and don't use like animate, inanimate and neuter. So said Tholkappier in grammar thesis. - Hmm. - Hey, stop it. You're ranting away preaches without a break like a sage on some devotional channel. You think you're better than us just because you know a few things? - Yes. - What yes? - Can you drink like us? - Can you smoke like us? Can you eat biryani like us? Can you puke like us after eating? Can you spit like us? Can you write names on the wall with your urine? Is this all the difference between me and humans? - He's staring us down. - Shall we feed him some biryani? I can't eat all these. It's in my rule list. Hey, doen't the rule list also say that - you should listen to us? - Hmm, yeah. - Then here. Have some liquor. - Have some biryani. Wait. Let me ask the doctor. - Hey, why the doctor? - Why ask the doctor? - Hello? - Doctor. They are asking me to drink alcohol, beverages and eat biryani. Rule priority clashes. What should I do? Beat those rascals with slippers. Yes, doctor. Command received. Listen. - Give me your slippers. - Huh? - Slippers? - Slippers? - Here. - Here. Are you going to eat it? Chitti, why are you hitting us? Stop it, Chitti. We haven't done anything wrong. - It hurts. - Don't hit us. Everyone is looking at us. - Please spare us. - Please. - Task incomplete. - Incomplete? - Doctor, help us. - Help us. - Chitti is beating us up. - Help. Chitti, stop. - You deserve this. - No, sir. - Don't you have brains? - No, sir. I asked you to get him ready for AIRD evaluation, but you asked him to drink and eat biryani? We did no such thing, doctor. - He's lying, doctor. - Shut up. Only humans lie. Machines don't. Last warning, idiots. Next time, you'll be fired. Literally. - Uh-huh? - Task completed. A human's life is precious. Many of our brave soldiers lose their lives in every war. Many families face difficulties after losing them. There will be no human casualties if we use robots instead of humans. My goal is to create many such Andro Humonoid robots. And to give them to the lndian army. For which I need the AIRD approval. That's why I request all you scientists and officers to examine Chitti and give me your approval. Dot. Has this robot been created not to harm humans as stated in the Asimov's rules? This robot wasn't created like that. Because in the battlefield, the robots might have to kill humans. Let me check your color and shape perception. Take the red cube up and put it on the yellow pyramid. - Not possible. - Then? Reverse is possible. Yellow pyramid on the red cube. In a race between the Greek sprinter, Achilles, and a tortoise, if the tortoise gets a head start, it will win. This has been proven in a theory. - Are you aware of this? - Yes. I am. It's a paradox. In reality, since it's a conversion series, Achilles might win as well. What do you think? - Should we approve him? - Sure. One minute, please. Do you know the value of human life? It depends on whose life it is. If in danger, whom will you save first? Doctor Einstein or a child? Hypothetical question. Smart answer. Now follow my commands. Please get up. Turn. Walk. Turn right. Run forward. Run around. Run back. Turn left. Jump. Right. Run forward. Fast. Faster. Faster! Catch. Kill Vaseegaran. Stop. Huh? Take it out. This is a dangerous machine. It can kill anyone. It can't be approved. No, Professor. You confused him by giving him random commands. That's the problem. He doesn't know what's good, bad, friend or foe. It is just a stupid inference engine. That's all. If he's enrolled into the army... he could attack our generals instead of the enemies. He could chop off the hand of a traffic cop. He could beat a passenger of an electric train into a pulp. This robot can be used only in routine programmed jobs in some factory. Sorry, doctor. Cannot clear. Professor, what do you have against me? - Tell me... - Please. Please don't misunderstand me. I have nothing against you. But science mustn't get defamed. But,... Why, Chitti? I taught you everything, still you messed it all up. What have I done wrong? You told me to follow his orders. I did. You will kill me if he tells you to? - That's what 'kill' means. - Oh, ho! - Save us. - Help us. Chitti, stop the car. Someone, douse it with water. Sir, the fire brigade troops can't get close. Lots of people are trapped inside, sir. Send more force immediately, sir. Chitti, can you save them? It's 799 degree Celsius. I can resist fire up to 1000 degrees. I can save them. Go! - Chitti, no life should be harmed. - Okay. Somebody please save us. Please, save us. Please, save us. Someone, please. Don't be scared. l'm Chitti. The robot. I'm here to save you. I would've been dead if it had not for him. - Welldone, Chitti. - Thank you. Help! Someone, help! Please, help. Professor! Watch the TV. The robot you rejected, saying it's dangerous to humans, is now saving people from the fire. See it for yourself. Someone, please same my son. Someone help. Someone save me from this fire. Someone help. Help. Get down. - Selvi. - Everyone's out, right? Selvi. - Please check. - Selvi. - Selvi. - What happened, Aunty? My daughter Selvi was having a bath inside. I don't know what happened to her. Save my daughter, please. Chitti. Someone save me. Save me. Someone, save me. Save me. Don't come near me. l'm not wearing any clothes. No. Don't come near. So what? I'm also naked. No. I'm not wearing any clothes. Leave me. Everyone's watching me. Leave me. - Leave me. - Here's Selvi. You have done something so stupid. She is not wearing any clothes. But she is alive. - Selvi. Dear, Selvi. - They are taking my pictures. Hello, hello, hello. Don't take pictures, please. - Listen to me, please. - Selvi, Selvi! Selvi, stop. - Where are you going? - Hey, stop. - Don't run. - Selvi. - Stop. - Selvi! Selvi, Selvi. I told you to stop. But you did not listen to me. Selvi. So, Vasi? He just killed an innocent girl. I told you it's a stupid machine. It's dangerous to let it be outside. I did the right thing by rejecting him. You've proven this yourself. Bad luck, Vasi. You're an idiot. Why didn't you cover her with a cloth? How can he know, Vasigaran? He is not a human, but a humanoid. How will you explain to this machine what honor is? - Professor! - Sorry Vasi. The video of the girl's suicide is all over every media. CNN, Times have shown it over and over. The defence minister is putting pressure on me... to stop this research. No, Professor. I can't do that. I can fix him by making changes in his program. How will you do that? He can't differentiate a male and female. He doesn't understand shame and honour. He is like a stone who doesn't understand human emotions. I can give him human emotions. Impossible. Only God can give that. Many things that were impossible before are possible today. You are my senior. That's why I'm telling you. It's a waste of time and energy. 10 years, Professor. 10 years of hard work. Won't I get any fruit of that? You will. But from somewhere else. I've contacts with many... robot companies in foreign countries. If you hand him over to me. I can get you millions of dollars. No, Professor. I didn't do this for money. My goal is to hand him over to our army. Not possible. He'll have to come to me. For the evaluation. Give me one last chance. Please. Okay. Take a month and try again. If you still can't get it sorted out, then dismantle it and sell him to a scrap dealer and buy some dates with that money. It's very good for the heart. You'll need it. Sir,... we've been working very hard in this lab for the last 5 years. We've got nothing but beating with slippers. Let us know if there is any position available in your lab. Do you know anything about Chitti's neural schema? We know everything except that, sir. I'll call if you if I need you. [HUMAN FEELINGS] [ANGER] [EXITEMENT] What are you doing, doctor? I'm installing software hormones. The hormones secreted only with feelings, right? I'm going to do reverse mapping. Chitti, in the whole universe and earth... the creation of life is a huge miracle. No-one knows how life in living creatures evolved. What is life? DNA is the basic element of life. Is this life? Life is not a formula. Oh, God. How do I explain it to you? A bacteria has life, but sodium doesn't. - What about me? - For you... Chitti! Chitti! Chit... Be careful. This way. - Do you feel any changes? - I do. - What? What? - Your beard has grown by 0.5 mm. Stop joking, you fool. Within you? Is there any change within you? No. Wastage. You're useless. Total waste. Stupid idiot. - Vasi, calm down. - You keep quiet, Sana. He won't feel anything. Titanium head. Stupid. Vasi, please. For so long, Sana. I didn't have time to sleep, to eat, and to talk to you. I worked hard for so many years. I taught him so much. And how I struggled to teach him?? And he is standing there like a lamp post. Good for nothing. Useless fellow. Useless machine. I'll dismantle you and throw you away. Don't scold me needlessly. I've been following all your instructions correctly. It's not my fault if I still can't meet your expectations. It's your fault. - If l'm a waste, so are you. - What did you say? - Vasi, wait. - Let me go. - Look, Chitti is angry. - Let go off me. He has feelings. My God! Hello, Sana. Lataka is having labor pains. She is in a critical condition. Come quickly. Lataka, don't worry. Everything will be alright. Don't worry. We are here with you. Uh, are there are many complications, doctor? You study here, don't you? Fatal cause. The baby is upside down. His neck is in knots. Dropping pulse rate, blood loss, she has all the complications. It's difficult to save even one of them. Oh, no. Not long after she got married, her husband died in a war. She's living for this child only. Please, doctor. Save both of them. I can only try, Sana. The rest is... May I try? - Who are you? Doctor? - No. I'm Chitti. The robot. - Robot? - Chitti, can you do this? - Why not? - Sorry. We can't allow this. This is not a lab. This is a labor ward. Both lives are under total risk. Even for experienced people like us, this is a nightmare. I can do this. I've studied this for Sana's exams. Even Sana can't do this. To carry out a caesarean, You need qualification and experience. It's against the medical law. There is no need for the caesarean. I can help her deliver the natural way. How will you do it? Both of them will die. - She's bleeding. - We'll do the plasma transfusion. The blood pressure is high. She may get convulsions any moment. Administer magsulf regimen The pelvic is disproportionate. Normal delivery is not possible. Possible. We can do Symphysiatomy. An ancient method of delivery. By removing the hip bone. Chitti, are you sure? Don't scream. The baby's getting scared. We are making history. A robot is helping deliver a baby for the first time. The baby is just like you. You want to see? Doctor, switch the Wi-Fi on. I'll stream the ultrasound video. My God! It's unbelievable! Sir, will we see such operations in the future? Is it dangerous for the patient? This is a milestone in Robotics. This is a major achievement in artificial intelligence. Doctor? She is dying. Just 95 seconds to go. Keep your eyes open. - Stay conscious. - lt's on its way out. Lataka. He'll be born exactly 40 minutes and 4 seconds past 4:00. Done. 52 seconds more. You can do it. Only 35 seconds to go now. Come on. Welcome. Great. Thank you. - Yes! - Yes! Excuse me. Will you approve Chitti now? Definitely. But the real problem for you starts now. Ah, Chitti. Let's go thank him. Chitti. You were great in there. You did everything so professionally. I mean you saved both their lives. Hmm. The story has just begun. Wait and watch. Whoo-whoo! It's a great day for me, Chitti. What a moment! What a moment! I am extremely happy today. Thank you very much. Tune to sleeping mode and charge yourself. I'll see you in the morning. Goodnight. Chitti. 'Oh, my God.' 'Chitti.' 'You were great.' 'You were great in there.' Noooo. Chitti, what are you doing here at this hour? A mosquito was biting your cheek. - You came here to swat it? - No. I came here because I wanted to see you. What's this? Go. I liked it when you kissed me today. Kiss me again, then I'll leave. Hey, what's wrong with you? Coming here at 1:00 AM. Leave. Kiss me and I'll leave. Why are you troubling me? I kissed you for your achievement. Is there anyone else pregnant at home? Does this look like a maternity ward? What else do you want me to achieve? Tell me. What? A mosquito just bit me, right? Go and catch it. That's all. Chitti. Chitti. God. Hey, who bit Sana at Happy Homes? It wasn't me. My area is across the gutter. I was in the Kilpogh area. Rangoski is a mosquito from Indira Nagar. - Who is Rangoski? - It's me. - Did you bite Sana? - Yes, I did. Hmm. So what's so great about it? I've even bitten the chief minister. Come with me and apologize to her. Apologize? Huh! Fulfil my three demands - then I'll consider. - What demands? No. 1: I want to suck AB negative blood. Very yummy. It's very hard to get. Our lab technicians, Siva and Ravi, have that blood group. They keep troubling me all the time. Go and bite them all you want. Ah! Oh-oh! No. 2:... Ban all companies that manufacture mosquito repellents like Odomos, All Out and Goodnight. They disturb us a lot. And No. 3? Declare us as the national bird. Fools. You aren't birds, but insects. It's getting late. - Will you come along or not? - No, I won't. If you don't come along, I'll kill everyone of you. - Hey! - Hey! Who are you? How dare you're threatening us in our area? Have humans become so audacious? We've infected humans with Malaria, Dengue and Chikungunya. Did you forget all that? Let's show him our power. - Hey, Dengue Lakshmi. - Yes. - Cholera Jasmine - Yes. Go bite him! Sister, he has a thick skin. Cholera Jasmine has fractured her sting. Is that so? Go inside his mouth when he isn't looking. Okay. Aargh! Aargh! Aargh! Aargh! Sister, Dengue Lakshmi got electrocuted and died. Hey, this seems like a new machine like an electric bag. Let's back off and act like you're scared like when you faced the first repellents. We'll deal with him later. You can take Rangoski with you. Thank you. Look, Sana. This is the mosquito that bit you. Rangoski. Rangoski, apologize to Sana. Sorry. Don't come near this house again. - Warn you gang as well. - Yes, boss. Go. - Now, kiss me. - Chitti.

Welcome, Mr. Birmingher. Okay, l'll call you later. Hello. Bora is coming with agent Shah. - Meet him, Mr. Birmingher. - How do you do? There are many terrorist organizations that want to use robots, instead of humans, for spreading terrors and suicide squads. They're willing to pay any price. They have clients around the world. They want to see your model. Well, the prototype is ready. I am programming functionalities. You can have a look at the design and some functional modules in action. Great. They want 100 robots. The delivery in March. This is your advance. That's a deal. Please be seated. - Have a drink. - No. What about the robots? It's almost ready, Mr. Birmingher. Per our contract, you should've made the delivery by now. You're only showing us skeletons. We're running intense testing. I'm fine tuning it to zero-defect. I request you for, at least, a month's extension, Mr. Birmingher. We're disappointed, Dr. Bora. The 3rd of April is your deadline. Hope you understand. - Gift-pack this. - Okay sir. For whom? It's Sana's birthday today. - Gift-pack this one too. - Wait, wait, wait. - What's that for? - I want to give Sana a gift too. - I'm giving one, right? - So will I. - Who will pay for it? - You will. Why should I? Salary for my work. Machines don't get salaries. Do cars and refrigerators get salary? I am not a machine. If you don't pay me, I will go on strike. I won't charge my battery. I will stage a hunger strike. You'll ask for a credit card too? No need. I know your credit card number. I know your signature as well. Can't take it anymore. Pack both of them. Super. Okay? - Who will drive the car? - You will. I'm on leave today. I guess it's my turn. ♪ 50 kg Taj Mahal is all mine ♪ Keep your eyes on the road while driving. Mother, take this. Happy birthday, Sana. - Hey, Vasi. Many happy returns of the day. Thank you. Thank you so much. Hi, Sana. - Chitti. That's a new look. - Thank you. It's been 200,000 hours since you were born. To the world's most beautiful girl. Chitti, you brought a gift for me? That's so sweet. Wow, Chitti. This is awesome. Mother, help me. - Vasi, how does it look? - Very nice. - Nice, huh? - Yes. I love it, Chitti. Thank you. I also got you a similar necklace. This's a gift from your Chitti, right? That's special. Oh. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to dear Sana. Happy birthday... Stop the music. Can I have your attention please? I have an announcement for you. Soon I am going to marry this beautiful birthday girl. I'm proud to say that I'm the lucky guy. And today, I announce my marriage. Yes! Folks, it's time to dance. Get started with move. Waltz, please. - Come on, Vasi. - Oh, no, no. I can't dance. - Come on. - Sana, I can't.. Just try. Come. My God. Shall we dance? Sure. Hey, this is grandpa's music. Can we have some blast, please? Sure. ♪ Boom, boom, robot ♪ ♪ Robot, robot ♪ ♪ Zoom, zoom, robot ♪ ♪ Robot, robot ♪ ♪ Robot ♪ ♪ Robot ♪ ♪ Robot, robot, robot, robot ♪ Okay. Rascal! What are you up to? I felt like kissing Sana. I did. Don't you know it's wrong to kiss someone else''s girlfriend? I know. It's in the list of rules. But, I felt like breaking the rules. Enough. You must not come near her anymore. - Why? - What do you mean "why"? Because I love her. I love her too. Don't be crazy. That's not possible. - You're a machine. - Yes. But, a machine with all the feelings like happiness, sorrow, love and anger. You've been given these emotions so that you to understand the situation and behave properly and not to misuse them. I like this feeling. I want Sana. Dot. What are you saying, Chitti? I am going to marry her, you fool. You can marry someone else. You can't do this, Chitti. I've built you. This is called betrayal. You can do this, Vasi. You gave up your love for your research. That's called sacrifice. - I'll thrash you. - Vasi. I won't feel pain, but you will. - I'll dismantle you. - I don't like it. - What did you say, you scoundrel? - Vasi. Calm down. - Chitti? - Hmm. Listen to me. You speak so tenderly. He just scolds. No, you want me to fondle you? - Ask him to shut up. - You... Vasi. Chitti, please understand. Even if you have all the emotions,... but, it's impossible for a girl to fall in love with a machine. Why is it impossible? I'm not inferior to any human. I'll take care of you better than him, Sana. He's talking nonsense and you're listening. Ask him not to interrupt. - What makes him so special? - Vasi, please. He doesn't even know how to cook. I can cook 25 different types. I can sing lullabies in 32 languages to put you to sleep. He'll grow old. His hair will turn grey. He will die. But I will never die. I will always keep you happy, Sana. Oh, for... I don't mean that, Chitti. What then? Sex, huh? Is sex life? Can't we have love without sex? That's not it, Chitti. Then? Children? There are millions of impotent men in India, Sana. Don't they ladopt kids and ive happily? - That's not it, Chitti. - What else? Whatever you're saying is against nature. You weren't born, you can't die, you don't get hungry or thirsty. You're not a living organism. Only a man and woman can fall in love. I love Vaseegaran. You're like my best friend. It's difficult for humans to forget, Chitti. But, it's easy for you. lt only takes you a second to erase memories about me. Erase them. Erase me off your memory. Who? Who are you? Your friend, Professor Bora, Chitti. Why are you here? You're upset. I am here to console you. You're my boss's enemy. You chided and rejected me. I don't want to talk to you. If l hadn't rejected you,... you wouldn't have gotten these emotions of love and angry, Chitti. I actually did you a favor. Vaseegaran treats you so badly. I don't want to hear anything. You can go now. In the world today,... you're the most advanced robot. He uses you for cooking, washing clothes, cleaning toilets, and other household chores. What did he give you in return, Chitti? Nothing. Nothing. If you were with me,... I would treat you like a king. You're polluting me. l'm only pointing out your importance. You're better than humans. You have the right to desire anything in this world. Including Sana. But, they say it's against nature. No. It's new to nature. Sana loves Vaseegaran. Let her. Don't lovers change their mind and fall in love with others? Sana too can change her mind and fall in love with you, isn't it? Don't confuse me. Tomorrow's my army evaluation. l have to run my diagnostics and troubleshoot. Okay, Chitti. All the best. You'll get selected in the army evaluation tomorrow. Vaseegaran will get fame and money. Then he'll marry Sana. And go for a honeymoon in Kashmir. And you... will be in the same Kashmir... cooking and cleaning... for them. Chitti? Who were you talking to? Um... Myself. Are you ready for tomorrow's evaluation? Ready, doctor. Hmm. Gentlemen, this robot is a fine example of human's excellence. He's equal to 100 soldiers agility, strength, and fighting skills. He can protect our borders as well as attack our enemies. In short, he is one man army. I'm dedicating him to the Indian army. You can test him for yourself. Chitti, can you spot HE-36 hand grenade? Yes, General. Smart. Can you bomb tent No. 3 with that? What is this? Sana. Chitti. Sana. The beautiful girl who compels machines to fall love with her. What? Just her touch can turn a machine into a human. And a human turns into a machine. Chitti, what is this? Throw it. Her tresses are like a black waterfall. Her forehead is like a piece of moon. Her eyes are like the Bermuda Triangle where people get lost. Her lips are like soft rose petals. Chitti. Her waist sways like a serpent. - And... - Chitti, stop it. What nonsense is this, Dr. Vaseegaran? lnstead of fighting a war, this robot is reciting poetry. - I'm sorry, General. - Friends,... drop your guns and hold the stoles instead. Forget the cannons and fall in love with someone. - Why having war? - Chitti? What are these weapons for? Love will turn foes into friends. Chitti enough. Don't embarrass me further. No war. Only love. Stupid scientist. Stupid machine. Waste of time. You ruined my reputation. Doctor, what are you doing? You destroyed my dreams. Doctor, don't cut me. I treated you as my son. I want to live. Let me live. Please. A useless machine like you doesn't deserve live in this world. I will destroy it. What's my mistake? It was my mistake to create you. Did I tell you to create me? Did I tell you to give me emotions? Did I tell Sana to kiss me? You... You did everything yourselves Now I want to live. But, you are killing me. This is injustice. Shut up. Spare me. I want to live. I want to love. I love Sana. I want Sana. I love Sana. I... love... Forget it, Vasi. I am also feeling sad about it. How long are you gonna be like this remembering him? Chitti is gone. It is just a machine. You are a great scientist. You can make many more Chittis like him. I never considered Chitti as a machine, Sana. I've brought you out here so you can forget him. And all you're doing is thinking about him. You have to snap out of it. Divert your mind. Chitti was my life time achievement. - My 10 years' hard work. - Oh, God. Come, let's go for a walk. Are you coming to the beach with me or not? I don't feel like it. You go ahead, Sana. If you don't come with me, I will definitely end our relationship. Okay, I will go alone. I will make the first man I meet my boyfriend. Hello. Hi. Uh, uh, hello. Wait! Listen! What is your name? Bachimohan. Bachi, will you be my boyfriend for a day? - Boyfriend for a day? - Yes. Like in the movie, the Chief Minister for one day. - This is boyfriend for a day. - Oh, God. You are fair and beautiful. I am dark and ugly. I will be your boyfriend? - Yes. - Oh. How should I thank you? I cannot believe it. It's like winning a billion in lottery. Okay, what gift are you giving your girlfriend? Some liquor and dry fish. - Have some. - Okay. Cheers. Have some and experience the high. No, thanks. Can I have some? It's useless. Okay, Bachi. I'm leaving. Hey, why are you holding my hand? Come on. You made me your boyfriend for a day. You enkindled desires in me. - How can you leave now? - Disgusting. My boyfriend is over there. I said all that to make him jealous. Let go. Let go of my hand. What do you think I am? Fulfill my desire before you go. Let go. Vasi! Vasi... Why are you calling Vasi, Vasi? Hey, are you calling your man? I won't let go of you no matter who comes. Vasi. Vasi, come. - Now. - Hey. - Hey, hey, hey. - Let go of her. Hey, she is my girlfriend for today. You can come back tomorrow. Hey, I will kill you. Hey, I will slice you up. Police! Police! Help! Help! Hey, I know the IG (Inspector General). Look, I will call him up and have you arrested. Hey, I will never get a beautiful girl like this in my life. I am willing to spend the rest of my life in prison for her. Call him, call him. Go ahead, call him. Oh, God. If Chitti was here, this would be different. He would've broken all his bones. Why are you talking about Chitti now? - Huh? - Huh? Vasi, do something. - There is only one option left. - What? - One... - Aagh! - Two... - Huh? Three. Escape. Hey!

What happened? Chitti bungled the army evaluation. He was destroyed and dumped in the thrash, sir. We don't keep 2-days' old junk here. It must have been dumped at the dumping area by now. - Where is that? - Dharamgudi. Sana, what did you do to make him change his mind? - When should we fix the wedding? - Uhuh, uh... I haven't achieved anything yet, Father. I'll make another robot and... I'll kill you if you talk about another robot again. Son, isn't one broken TV enough? - Uncle. - Huh. If you've auspicious thread, I'll tie the knot with him right now. Okay, okay. I understand your worry. Do one thing. Exchange rings for now. We will get you married on the next auspicious date. Hey. Help. Help. Take me to Professor Bora's lab. Address. A-417, Niketan Colony. It's a small world, Chitti. I want to live. I want to love. I love Sana. Help me, Professor. Please. Make me as I was before. I want to live. I want Sana. And I want your neural schema. You can take whatever you want. Make me the Chitti I was, please. I will, Chitti. Don't worry. What's this red chip? It doesn't belong to Chitti. This is Bora's touch. Additional program for Chitti. Destruction program. Vaseegaran gave him the power of 100 men to protect humans. I am giving him the destructive power of 100 humans. In short, he is a demon now. I am feeling scared, Professor. Why are you changing like that? Business. This is my business trial. - Business? - I'll get the money... Dr.Vasigaran gets the blame. Thank you, Bora. Have a good time, Chitti. I am going to meet Sana. Sana is not at home. She must be at Raja Muthiah Hall. Why? Vaseegaran and Sana are getting married today. Chitti, how did you come here... Upgraded. Version 2.0. - Chitti, let go of me. - Hey, hey... - Chitti, what's this? - Chitti, hey. Hey, Chitti. Stop. Vasi. Chitti. No matter how much you force me, I love Vaseegaran only and will spend my life with him. Only if he stays alive. Kill me before you kill Vaseegaran. Vasi. I spared his life because of you. Chitti, why are you doing this? Stop it. Car number TN09 BB11. Help me, please. Madam, come out fast. Give me your hand.

Do you know it killed many policemen and caused so much damage? You are responsible for all this. We will take action against you. Sir, this is not the robot that I created. I destroyed it with my own hands and threw it in the dustbin. I don't know how did this happen. First, we must find that robot and stop it. - Tell us how to do it. - I'll find out. That's my responsibility. Give me a minute. Why are you disturbing me? Chitti, what happened to you? Your system has completely corrupted. I have to troubleshoot you. - Come to the lab with Sana. - No way. I won't take your orders anymore. Hey, don't forget that I created you. And then you destroyed me. Now, I have nothing to do with you. I'm going to marry Sana and start a new life. Now, don't disturb me anymore. Hey, don't be so arrogant? After all, you are a machine. If I can make you, I can also destroy you. So come here with Sana without making any fuss. Nobody can destroy me. Sir, cash, cheque or credit card? Gun. Alert all the cops in South Chennai to block all the roads from T. Nagar and check all vehicles. Move aside! Run! Chitti is fleeing after robbing City Center Mall. Seal all areas around Mahilapur. - Go to Dr. Radhakrishna road. - Okay, sir. Hey, stop him. Stop him! Stop him! Someone stop him! We received the report that Chitti is at Ennore petrol filling station. Hey, stop! - Go get the truck. - Okay, boss. Hey, stop! The robot is entering the harbour. Good. You keep following him and maintaining some distance. Coast guards will take care of the rest. We had to take this risk. lf we hadn't destroyed Chitti, people would've faced more damage. Wasn't there any other safer way to destroy Chitti? It's so difficult to catch one person. Can you imagine the difficulty to catch a robot that is equivalent to 100 men? - Who is the head of this operation? - Commissioner. - This is not Chitti. - What? This is not the robot I created. All the parts are different. I'm puzzling about that too. He robbed four places at the same time. And they are in four different corners of the city. How is it possible for one person to do all this? I suspect one person. Oh, God. No one can destroy me. - Activate command mode. - I am CR2. Speed: 1 terahertz. Memory: 1 zeta byte. Command mode activated. Chitti, what are you doing? I am cloning myself. And they will clone themselves. 2 will become 4. 4 will become 8. 8 will become 16. They are my servants, soldiers and terminators. No. I will not allow this. I am not Vaseegaran to seek your approval, Bora. I am Chitti. Look, Chitti. I've already accepted money from the dealers. If I don't deliver robots within two days they will kill me. Then die. You bloody traitor. How dare you are betraying the person who gave you life? Chitti, delete all the programs you created immediately. I will slit her throat. I mean it. Don't be foolish. Delete the programs. I said get on with it! Hurry up! Come on...! Command executed. Give us an order. We will shoot him. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. He gave me a new life. Only I can put my hand on his head. 'Robot occupies AIRD. Kills the security guard.' 'Let's cut across live to our correspondent ' 'who is right there at the scene.' Robot entered suddenly... Ordered us to leave or would kill us. Killed the security guards who resisted. There's tension in the air. And the sense of panic and fear has gripped the AIRD. As robots occupied AIRD the entire area surrounding it has been completely evacuated. And the police are trying their best to drive the robots out from that place. Hmm. This is our palace. Here I am the king and you are the queen. I have filled this place with everything you like. I have brought everything you need. Hmmmm. This is our bedroom. We will live happily here after our marriage. No. Why are you blabbering same nonsense again? We can't get married. - Nobody will be happy. - We will, Sana. I am fully prepared to settle down with you. I can give you all the happiness that a human being can give you. Don't you get it? I'm creating an artificial embryo. We can program in advance the kind of baby we want. I will then inject it in your womb. You will give birth to the first child born of a human being and a robot. Robo-sapiens. Shall we begin, my love? - No. - Hey. It is useless to cry like Mother Sita trapped in Ashok forest. You can't escape from here. No-one can save you. You can't commit suicide. Whether you like it or not, I will inject the artificial embryo in your womb. After you give birth to a child, you have no choice but surrender to me. Do we have to do all this? No. Come. Let's enjoy now itself. Give a beautiful kiss to your great king, baby. Come. Come. Come. Come. Come Come, baby. Come. Come. Get the permission from the Electricity Board. Then I will tell you when to disconnect the electricity of that area. Get a similar petrol tanker like the one exploded at the harbor. And fill it with water instead of petrol. CR42. Gather at the database room at 8.00 PM tonight. Everyone will obtain new information as per their ranks. 2:00 PM tomorrow has been allotted as the time to calibrate all your censors at the hardware section. From today, everyone's recharge time has been reduced to 10 minutes. Heat resistance has been increased to 1220 celcius. Her Highness' body temperature is high. Give her low-calorie food and avoid the red meat. Ice-cream. Use low-calorie dressing in the salad. Highness, dinner's ready. Sa... There's some noise coming from your system. - No, there's no noise. - It's quite loud. Is your microphone also not working? There's some problem in your system. Let me fix it. Sana. It's me, Vaseegaran. I've come like Chitti to meet you. Sana. Vasi. Vasi. Vasi? Please, get me out of here. - I am very scared. - Don't worry. I have planned everything. But one thing. I can't take you out of here till Chitti is destroyed. And only you can destroy Chitti. You will have to pretend and grab Chitti's attention for the next 24 hours. I will take care of the rest. There's a confusion between robots, commander. What happened? A different robot is delivering dinner to Her Highness. Bedroom's CCTV camera stopped working 10 minutes ago. - Good news, commander. - What is it? Her Highness had her dinner. She wants to see you immediately. Is that so? - Switch it off. - Yes, sir. Switch it off. Hey, what happened? Wow! Beautiful! There are two things created by human worth praising. One is me... and the other is you. What a pleasant surprise! What brought about this change, Sana? I've realised now that your love is real love. - I understood it, Chitti. - I can't believe it. I thought about it from the beginning, Chitti. You helped me a lot. You loved me so much. Other than loving me, you made no other mistake. Even after you were broken into bits and pieces,... you came back for me again. Really, Chitti. I am impressed. Aah-hah. It's so nice to hear that, Sana. But at the same time, I also suspect if this is some conspiracy against me. Is it possible for anyone to cheat you, Chitti? This is the engagement ring that Vaseegaran gave me. Wow! I'm yours.

Don't come closer or I will shoot you. Stop acting like a child. - Hey. - Hey. - Hey, you. - What are you doing? Hey, who are you? What are you doing? [Home Ministry] Hello. I am sorry, sir. I didn't know our plan would backfire like this. There's only one way to outsmart Chitti. Just do as I say. Did Vaseegaran come here? - No. - Lier! Human flaw. You taught me that. Have you forgotten it? Your body language shows that you are lying. I am telling the truth, Chitti. - I think, that must be my blood. - Really? Why not say it's my blood? Yours is 'O positive' and his is 'AB negative'. And he must be somewhere around here. No? A different robot delivered dinner to you. The camera stopped working for 10 minutes. Your sudden change of mind. Power failure. Water in the generator. Vaseegaran is somewhere around here. Are you fooling me, Sana? No, Chitti. You lied when you said you love me, right? That's not true, Chitti. So you really love me? Yes, I really do. Then Vaseegaran shouldn't be alive. Come. Let's kill Vaseegaran. Soldiers! Assemble! Soldiers! We have intrusion. A black sheep has intruded this place to destroy us from within. We have to destroy him. Who is that black sheep? Dr. Vaseegaran? if you come forward on your own,... I will give you a painless death. But if I find you,... your death will be very painful. Robot. Come. Come. Come. Come. Come. Come. Come. Come. Sad. Vaseegaran is not here, Sana. - Yes. - Pick one finger. Then Vaseegaran is here. What happened, Sana? Is your head spinning? Now it will. Soldiers! Rotate your heads. Yeah, hah. A black sheep. Vasi. Stop. He's the intruder. Hey, no, no, no, no. Down, down. Hmm-Mmm. You said that you made me. And you could also destroy me too. Now, you're going to die in my hands. What are you looking at? This is hand gun I made it myself. Handmade. It's that nice? Where shall I shoot you? Huh? In your head, which planned to destroy me. Or in the heart,... where my Sana resides? I should shoot in your head which thought of killing me. - Sana, come. - Vasi. Come, come. Fire! Fire! Bring that robot. Keep it here. May I come in? Yes. Move! Fire. Hey, bring the van out. Come on. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. Committed thousands of murders. Severely injured many others. And damaged property worth billions. Dr. Vaseegaran, you're responsible for all this. By the decision of this court, you shall get the death penalty, and your research lab must be shut down. Can I say something? We cannot accept a machine as witness. I am not a witness, but evidence. The court can't accept this. It will, sir. According to section 3 of evidence act 1872,... an evidence can be material or documentary. Huh? You may proceed. Firstly, I would like to shed some light on an issue, Your Honor. Whenever someone dies due to the mistake made by a machine, it's termed as an accident, not murder. Secondly, the person responsible for the incidents is not Dr. Vaseegaran. It was Professor Bora. This is a new story. Your Honor, professor Bora is dead. He's trying to divert the case. I have evidence, Your Honor. That is not Chitti's. 'It's for Chitti.' 'Additional programming' 'Destruction program.' 'Vaseegaran gave him the power and talent of 100 humans.' 'I give him the destructive powers of 100 humans.' I'll get the money and Dr.Vasigaran gets the blame. All the evidence is very important. Based on the evidence, the court acquits Vaseegaran. This robot has extraordinary power and intelligence. It can harm humans at any time. And we can't overlook the danger of it being misused either. An advanced robot like him may be useful in the future. But, we don't need it in today's life. Therefore, this court bans this robot from usage forever. This court orders this robot to be dismantled... in the presence of the District Magistrate and Police Commissioner. Dismantle it. You need any help, doctor? - Dismantle yourself, Chitti. - Sure, doctor. Shiva? Ravi? You said that you have a special thing that I don't. See how many problems it created? I mean feelings. Don't cry. Sister Lata. How is your son now? I have named him after you, Chitti. Mother gave me that name. Educate him well. There is a good future in robotics. Professor Bora? Like the red chip you installed in me, every human has such red chip of lies, envy, deceit and dishonesty in their heart. Thankfully, I am not a human. Otherwise, I could never get rid of it even if I wanted to. I've tormented you a lot. I am extremely sorry, Sana. Hey, why are you all sad? Let me tell you a joke. It's said that love makes a person lose his head. Look. It's the same with me. I am going to miss you, Sana. Not as a boyfriend. As a toy-friend. Doctor? You're my God. I betrayed you. It was wrong to break the rules. - Forgive me. - No, Chitti. You learnt to break rules from humans. The mistake is not entirely yours. Thank you, doctor. I am feeling good, doctor. Be sure you're not touching anything. Children? What you're looking at... is Chitti. The most advanced andro-humanized robot. 20 years ago, Dr. Vaseegaran had built it. It was dismantled for some reasons. Why? Because I started to think. Okay, children. Come, let's go to the next section.
