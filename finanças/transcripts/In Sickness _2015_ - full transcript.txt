Good afternoon, everyone. For those who are new here I'm Michelle. Think we can get started. To let anyone new know we want you to feel comfortable here. We know how hard it already is for you. You can sit and listen but know that talking about it is what helps you gain a clearer sense of what you're dealing with. So, then, who would like to begin? We haven't seen you here before. It's very fearless of you to stand up right away. And what is your name? - Kendall. Um. We've been together for two years. And his, um, father passed away recently a month ago, actually. And since then [ Soft music playing ] all the little things that I try to put out of my head they kind of just exploded. [ Birds calling ] It's just a hard one. [ Soft music playing ] It's... It's just hard when you love somebody and they become so different. Why are you here Kendall? Because I love him. I want to make things work again. [ Soft music continues ] That's it.. Thank you. [ Music builds deeper ] Andrew? Hi. - Hi. - Hey! [ Kiss sound ] I got it. Thank you. - You're welcome, baby.

[ Chuckling ] But she loved that garden. [ Hospital sounds ] - Anything else? [ Birds chirping ] - You know Kendall reminds me of her. - Yeah? When you took, you took up Paris so fast.

[ Mumbling ] you don't think so. - I think someone has been talking to Hailey. - No umm I have been thinking about this. I've been thinking about it for awhile and you're doing so well at work. I thought that this would be a good time. Yeah. - Maybe? - Maybe? - Maybe you're right.

Go paint! Go paint go paint! - No wait! I don't give a fuck where they think the numbers are. [ Chatter, phones ringing ] I set the bottom line and that's what it is.

I'll see you at the hospital it's fine. [ Deep music emerges ] [ Chatter, phones ringing ] [ Deep music continues, heart beating, Hospital sounds ] [ Flatlining sound ] - Andrew?! - Kendall..

Just calm down okay [ Phone ringing outgoing ] [ Phone busy sound ] [ Redial tone, phone ringing outgoing ] [ Knocking on door ] Come in. Hello, Mrs. Madera - Dr Poslow - Hi.. Please come in, have a seat. Hi, it's lovely to finally meet you. Andrew has told me so much about you. I wish I could say the same. Well, I am Andrew's psychiatrist, uh, and I would have hoped he'd spoken to you much sooner about his visits But I suppose it's better, late than never. - Uh, we're still living in never. - What do you mean? - Andrew hasn't told me anything about you or your meetings Uh, I came to your office because I found your number on his anxiety medication. - Uh, is everything okay? - Not really. Um, Andrew had a really weird, severe, uh, episode at work today. - Uh huh - Um, I've never seen him like that. I was wondering if maybe his anxiety is just forced because his, his father passed away recently and maybe there's something wrong with his medication that's not quite right or something. - Uh huh Well, what exactly happen today? - Uh, I don't really know exactly. Um, he, he attacked one of his coworkers. I don't know why. Um, he was acting paranoid and hallucinating. He, he wasn't making any sense. I didn't understand what was happening to him. - Well, that definitely sounds more serious than anxiety. - Yeah, I thought so too. What are you.. do you? What do you think it was? - Oh boy - Mrs. Madera? I'm really not at liberty to say. There's a doctor patient privilege at work here and without Andrew's consent or legal necessity, I'm kind of setting. - But I'm his wife. - I understand that. Um, it could be any number of factors. His father passing, like you said, could definitely have triggered depression high stress scenarios, bipolar disorder, even schizophrenia, but he needs further testing. He needs a complete medical evaluation before we can even talk about about proper treatment. [ Revealing music ] - Uh. [ Music continues ] Sorry. - No, please take your time. - Okay. What do I, what do I do? What can I do? What can we do? - Well, you know, it's not really about what you can do or what I can do or what we can do. It's about what Andrew will allow us to do. He has to want help before we can even approach a treatment plan or getting proper medications. That's the first major step. [ Music continues ] - Okay. Um I guess that's all you can tell me. - Yeah I'm sorry. - Um, okay. I didn't tell Andrew that I was coming here, so don't. - Oh, no, no, no, I wouldn't. Um, but it may be a good idea if you did talk about it with him. Now. - Yeah. Okay. Thank you. - You're welcome Call me if you need anything. - I will. It was to meet you. - Likewise Have a good day. You too. [ Music fades out ] [ Pencil scribbling ] [ Dark sounds ] [ Gentle knocking at door ] [ Strange mumbling voices ] [ Door opens then footsteps ] - Where were you? - Jesus God baby you scared me. - I asked you a question - I just had to get out. - Out where? - Driving. Just went driving. - Don't lie to me Kendall I'm not an idiot I know what you're doing - What are you talking about? The truth? Can I trust you to give me the truth again? Lying is a really difficult thing to follow. So what is the word of truth? Please give it to me. What is that? [ Sinister voices in his head, Dark sounds ] The voices telling me that you don't know the truth. You stay there. [ Sinister voices mumbling ] [ Dark music ] [ Sinister voice ] [ Body drop ] [ Dark music, Sinister voice singing ] - Your wife came to see me yesterday. - How haven't you told me? - Would you be comfortable if I discussed our sessions with her? - I'm sure you have already. - Well, not in any detail, but she genuinely seems to care and want to help you. - How come you didn't tell her you were seeing a psychiatrist? - Why would I? - What do you mean? - My business? Not hers. - How are you feeling since your father passed? How are you dealing with that? - Fine. Fine. - Good. You taking your meds? - I am taking all the pills, working. - Good. Good. You feel as though they're working? - Yes, they are. - Oh, that's great. Is there anything else you'd like to talk about? - No. Okay. - Well, let me ask you a question. What is it that you really enjoy doing Andrew? - Fucking. - What is it about sex? - I didn't say sex. I said fucking fucking my wife. I enjoy fucking my wife doctor. - Understood. - Yeah. - Can we see each other again next week? - Yeah, I'll call you. -Yeah, good, please do. - And you will, uh, tell, Kendall let, uh, we're good. I'm good. And I'm taking the pills. - I will, I will indeed. And, uh, please call me. - I will do that. - You can see Sandy on the way out and we'll see you next week. - Yes. - Have a good week. - Yeah you too doctor [ Pen scribbling ] [ Water running ] [ Heavy breathing ] [ Disturbing sounds ] [ Sinister voices ] Kendall baby [ Sinister voices overpower their words ] Okay. [ Sinister voices overpower their words ] Honey it's not real, Okay it's not real. [ Dark sounds ] It's not real [ Dark sounds fade out ] [ Sad music ] [ Giggling ] - Rob? Oh my God. - What the hell? - Sorry. - Kendall. Are you serious? - Sorry. - Kendall. You can't just barge into the house like this. - Rob, I'm sorry. - I'm really sorry. That was weird. I need to talk to you about Andrew - What's going on? - Yesterday, I came home and I found him sitting in the stairwell naked and shaking and crying. I don't know what the fuck is going on. - Okay. - There's something wrong with him. I don't know what to do, and I want to know the truth. He won't tell me anything I'm asking for your help right now. - I'm just going to go. - Sit, please. - Okay. I'm sorry. I'll call you later. Okay. - Okay. [ Drink pouring into glass ] - Thanks. - It will take the edge off. What I'm about to say. It's not going to be easy to hear. [ Dark music ] Okay? [ Dark music continues ] When Andrew was a child. He was molested by his babysitter and her husband. [ Disturbing sounds ] Angel came home one day to pick him up. knocks on the door. No answer. He steps inside. He calls out for Drew...for the babysitter. Still no answer. [ Disturbing sounds ] Eventually....he makes his way into the basement... where he finds Drew. Lying on the floor Damn near half naked. He finds his son curled up in a fetal position, lying on the floor of some basement. And no one's in sight He scoops him up, he takes him home. Now, five months later They find this bitch in a grocery store shopping with, I guess her then boyfriend. And Andrew. Has to testify in court. Explain every single detail. [ Sad music ] - I can't believe I never knew. - How could you? Just try an imagine telling the person that you love? More than life itself. [ Sad music ] It can't be easy. [ Sad music continues ] Andrew is lost. He's scared. He's alone. He's that little kid again. - Just to be clear, you two haven't been together very long, have you? - No - Well, you need to realize that people with certain mental illnesses strongly resist treatment. and Andrew's results show that his ventricles are slightly larger than average. And he was demonstrating abnormal glutamine and dopamine levels, which I suspect was because he wasn't taken away. - Right I don't understand what you're telling me. What do you mean certain mental illnesses? What's wrong with him? - I think he has a variation of schizophrenia [ Haunting sound ] - No - No, his dad just died. - I know [ Haunting sounds ] - His dad just died. - Well, maybe. But I'm going to give you some information here about a support group for families who are dealing with schizophrenia and you should really take your time with this. Do your homework, find out what you both might be facing. This support group could be the key to his recovery and they can really help you dive deeper. - I'm sorry about what happened. - It's family, you know, same shit, different dilemma. - Yeah. I still enjoyed us. - Really I'll remember to lock the frigging door next time - Can I have a scotch please. - Oh, there he is. Fashionably late as always. What's that? - Drugs, Kendall and Dr. Poslow want me to take. - What kind of drugs? Let me see. [ Restaurant crowd sounds ] What kind of drugs are these? - It doesn't matter. I'm not taking them. Thank you. [ Restaurant crowd sounds ] - Hey, listen to me. - Another please - You realize these are anti-psychotics right? - I'm not taking them. - That's why you shouldn't be drinking. [ Restaurant crowd sounds ] Here.... Water, please..... take your fucking meds. - I'm not taking the medication. - Dude. You're not drinking. - I'm not taking the medication! - What the hell is wrong with you? [ Phone rings ] - Answer that Is that Kendall? - No, it's not Kendall. - Is she calling from his house. Is she calling from Jack's house is she? - What, what are you talking about? You're not making- - Can I have that scotch! - No offense, but I will not serve you any more drinks. - Why not? Oh, is my money not good enough for you, huh? Huh? You think I'm sick. Don't you think I'm fucking sick. - Bro. What is going on with you? - Is there a problem here guys? - Mind your own business - Take your piss beer and mind your own fucking business. Like my cousin said. - I got this. I got, I got it. Cool off Alright. - Robbie you're the family, right? - I am. - This is coming. It's coming around again. It's coming. It's coming. - Okay. You're not making sense right now - Yes, I am. So we're going as you and I needed you the family and then dad was there. Right. And like, hush hush, don't talk about it. Don't talk about it because no one can know this happened. So when everything's been surrounded, it comes into focus right here, here. It's a matter of you being a fucking selfish prick, staying in dad's house, using all his shit, and then you go tell Kendall what happened that day. You told Kendall? - Alright. - That is she is my wife. Not yours. Not that asshole Jack's wife! Alright. What's he doing here? What the fuck is he doing here? Get the fuck away from me! Hey, well fuck him! Woahhh Chill out. There's no one there. Fucking chill out! Drew! Oh my God. Um, Babs, I gotta go. I'm sorry. [ Heavy breathing ] [ Mumbling: what is she doing? ] [ Sad music ] [ Doors slam open ] What are you doing? - Andrew what are you doing? - Kendall? - Andrew? Come here. - You don't trust your husband anymore? - Honey - You're talking to these people about your husband, huh? Huh? - No. How your poor husband is treating you so poorly. There's circles of trust circles of a friend circles. We should build sand castles and - Andrew - And washes it away in the intergalactic space. travel of it all I'm telling you right now, where is he? Is he hiding in here? He's hiding like a bat in the attic, huh? Bat in the Belfry cat on the mat that leather and lace - Sir you have to leave. Please get out now. - Don't you fucking touch me, Jack?! - Hey! - Jack. - Hey. Hi. Okay. Okay. Calm down. - I can smell him on you Kendall I can smell his cologne on your breath.

It's okay Kendall [ Police radio sounds ] [ Cries, Soft music ] - Are you okay? - Fine. - Rob's really upset Andrew. - You think I wanted to fight him? - I think you're sick. - I'm not. - I saw brain scans. I saw blood tests. You've been sick for months. You've known it. - People are trying to make me sick. - No, honey, you hurt Anthony. You, you attack that guy in support group. You need help. - Or else what? - I don't know. - You don't know. You're going to leave me? - We can't be together if you're not going to take anybody's help. - I always knew you still loved Jack. - Oh fuck. - I saw you at dad's funeral. - Oh my God. - Flirting, smoking a joint in the parking lot. - You know, that wasn't anything - And I'm the sick one.

[ Applause ] - Hi everyone. I'm Kendall. Um I guess first I would just now like to take a moment to thank you all so much for coming out this evening to support the art. Um [ Deep music begins ] these last few months have been, uh, very eventful....for me. And, um, I think that's reflected in my work. Um, uh, sorry. Uh, that's it, um, have a good time. Uh, enjoy yourselves. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thanks. [ Applause ] - Hey - Hi What are you doing here? - I was released today, especially - I mean what are you doing here. - Just support you and your show. I'm so proud of you, Kendall. It's amazing. - Thanks Andrew I don't think you understand, what you put me through. What do you want for me? - I want you, Kendall I want us. Hear me out I'm schizophrenia. I think my mother was too. I used to hear the word thrown around the house, but dad never wanted to talk about it. In my early twenties. I started to hear voices. I started to see things. I was given medication for anxiety. Supposedly, most of the time I was fine. Most of the time I didn't need it but one time they came out, they came back. The people Voices, every everything. And I... went to dad and the last thing he said to me in the hospital was don't let them control you. The doctors and I listened to him. I threw out my medication, my pills, and I became sick, sicker and sicker Kendall. I didn't know how to get out of it. So whatever you decide today Kendall, whatever you decide. If you stay with me, don't stay because of my sickness stay despite of it. [ Moving music ] I love you. - I love you too. [ Moving music ] Sometimes love isn't enough. [ Moving music ] - Sometimes love is not enough... [ Moving music ] [ Birds chirping ] - So then, who would like to begin? Go ahead, Kendall. - Thanks Michelle. - Why are you here Kendall? - The eternal question. Um I don't know why I'm here. Maybe Maybe to figure out what's next. [ Moving music ] Just don't. [ Moving music ] Everything was so amazing at first. It was the 4th of July and we were together and we just decided to do it. We just ran off together. He couldn't afford a ring so he just gave me this bracelet like an idiot, I accepted it. [ Moving music ] I don't know I feel like I feel like sometimes you just got to do that though. You know, you just go and say, fuck it. I didn't know. - Kendall? Who is he to you now?
