ALICE'S JOURNEY What? I like your pussy. I like it when you lick my pussy. That's dirty? No, but it's true. I don't have such big breasts. In my dreams you do. I'm replacing someone. Not even a month. It's your first contract? Yes, as a cadet. Your French is good. - Prefer French to English? - Yes, my mom teaches it. New rituals here. There's a cadaver on board. I don't think we can take a Christian body in a Muslim port. It's why they called you. I'm sleeping in the dead guy's bed? You take 1. I'll take 2. Antoine, man the valve. Alice? Frederic. Problems with the 24-volt. I've checked the blueprints. Tons of changes. A total mess. Not scared of ghosts? We call the ME1 "Demonia". Because he died in the engine room? We think he had a stroke near the ME1, then crawled here but... we don't know exactly. The men found him here. Yes. I see him... full of blood in his face. Very very scared. - Men... - Captain. The new second engineer got in? Not out of her depth? She's pulling her weight. It's fine. Sorry, it's... fine now. Gaël. You know each other? From when I was a cadet. Felix, it's Alice. I have internet. We're passing by Gibraltar. The address I gave you goes via the captain, as usual. So avoid dirty stuff. Use "C" for cock and "P" for pussy. It's crazy. I recognized the ship right away. First ship I sailed on. It's funny. It hasn't changed much. Take care. Still using the incinerator? Burning the sludge? What's this mess? Here. There was a change. Can Vali help with the corpse? The Filipinos will freak out. Sure. Vali, we'll make holes in the dead guy's body bag, so it sinks to the bottom. Weather won't be a problem? No, it's heading north. We'll skirt behind. Does the Company know about this? More or less. We said he fell overboard. Gaël really did a great job. Le Gall's last wish was a burial at sea. We'd never have gotten the permits. I'm going to bed. Sleep well. Men... Captain. I ate too much. Coming, Vali? Not going in? I can't. I don't want to. No rats for you in a shallow grave. Straight to the sharks. A sailor's soul won't rot under a field but breathes with each wave. Dear diary, loyal ear to my itinerant soul, companion in my wanderings, witness to my solitude. Patrick Le Gall. July 3rd. Cast off late. I brought a girl aboard. Kalina. Prices went up but she was okay with 3 times. Scars under her breasts, no fake nails. Playing Titanic? Think you're Kate Winslet? I prefer DiCaprio. You don't find it strange we're both here? And aboard the Eclipse. Only the name changed. Now it's over with. I try to smoke after my wife left me. I can't. Men... Good evening. I miss you, even at the oddest times. Hound a repair I did 10 years ago in a hurry. A blood-red stain between Mo pipes. I can't believe it held. Life aboard is hard. We have a lot of work. Now that we're on the ocean, everyone seems more relaxed. I'm lounging around tonight. Thinking of you. I want it so bad. My pad is piping hot, and my plaint pensive as I cravingly chant your commendations. So? Temperature deviations, cylinders 4, 5 and 6 in the Demonia. There was a slow-down. Alice went below. No low-fuel alarm? Not that I can see. It's over. You had me come for nothing. Dirty Gertie. My daughter's favorite cartoon. Dirty Gertie, nice! - Good job. - What did you do? Changed filter and drained it. My wife is pregnant. I send her everything I make. I'm happy to be single again. August 17th. Supposed to land but no news of the fit-out. Need to fill up with emotional oil. September 3rd. Saw Eliane in Toulon. Thought I'd fallen in love. Was wrong. Her voice annoyed me. Didn't like her scent. Couldn't make her cum. Was suddenly out of breath. Just like the doctor said. Lousy night. September 10th. Nadine's birthday. My kid sister is 40. Replaced cylinder head today. Exhausting work, unbearable heat. Good to get my hands in the machines again. Nice change from electricity. My heart stood the test. Wind died down, sea is smiling, blue and hypocritical, hiding its foamy white teeth. Ever seen illegal aliens? They try to blend in with the dockers. They usually wear anoraks and hats. If you see someone dressed to ski, tell us. What do we do with them? We lock them in a prison cabin. And ask their names. Once I ended up with a Johnny Walker and a Jack Daniels. We carried them all over Europe. No port wanted them. We let them out in Africa. Know what? You have to tie them up or they beat each other up and blame us. To get refugee status. Well done, the way you like it. Eat, you're skinny. I remember you being bigger. Disappointed? Reality never disappoints me. The captain of the vessel was enchanted by a beautiful boy The captain of the vessel had him come to the forecastle Because love draws us together we're going to get married The money that we've earned will be used in our household The money we've earned will be used to get us married What are you doing? I hope I'll come back as an animal that doesn't like water. Something in wide open spaces. A tiger or a lion... What about you? Antoine, finish your inventory? I have to send my order. I have a hangover too. Don't be unpleasant. We'll forget last night. But don't speak to me. Don't come near. Give me orders via the captain. Figure out how. And if you badmouth me in your report... What? Who will they stand behind? I told them. You know it's gonna blow. Don't you feel guilty enough? Now we're talking? I know I'm not the first. I can find the others. It's up to you. Leave and I'll keep quiet. But I'll tell every woman sailor. The whole merchant navy will know. Try it again and it'll be early retirement. You okay, Stephane? Pissed to stay ashore? I'm telling you to. Africa. I want to tell you, Africa... Get lost. Nice picture. - Lesage? - That's me. It's heavy. Never again. Out of the question. I don't understand. Fred? For you... Good luck. Pretty dress. You went all out! Hello. You're pretty. Happy birthday! No, it's tomorrow. Get my package? But it's tomorrow. I'll open it then. Why are you at my place? Another leak at yours? No, I have more room to work here. I'm afraid to tum the heater back on. Go to the water heater. I'll explain. See the little knob? Are you okay? Yep. I see. Now it's working! Sure it is. Honey... How's the ocean? It's fine. In port till tomorrow. So handsome. Me? Say you love me in Norwegian. Again. Again. Again. You're pretty. I want... to fuck you. Me too. They're sketch pads. - And those? - Also. They're nice. How much? 500 francs. I'll take one in each color. All seven? That'll be 3500 francs. I'll get some scotch. You have bottles of scotch? How is it? Gorgeous. All done. Very pretty. A message from my guy. That's so cute. Thanks, girls. No problem. Let's cheer on the crew of the Fidelio! And especially Vali, with us for the first time. And Alice, who's celebrating her birthday! Here are your presents! Kiss! Kiss! He's my present! They're crazy, aren't they? It's Gaël. 26, 27, 28, 29... 30. October 5th. Awful letter from Nadine. Her boyfriend left her. My sister is crushed and I can't help. If I were there, she wouldn't share this. She doesn't care about me. I only serve to hear her complaints from afar. I envy her. She suffers, but was at least in love. October 12th. Barbecue. Antoine drank too much. Fred too. When I hear their plights and gripes, their wives and lovers, I want to shout: Enjoy it! I'd die to feel that one day. I also drank too much. Barbereau. Fitter. Felizardo. Fitter, Felizardo. Flores, oiler. Barbereau. Antoine. Third engineer. Alice. Second engineer. Sorry, I'm hung over. No problem. The former chief gave me a report, but I have some questions. Hello. What's on your neck? Good job! I'll have some fruit cake. Please don't tempt me. I'd have used less orange blossom. Last time at sea, I gained 3 kilos. My wife was furious. In Bangkok, you wouldn't say that. Asians love big guys. You mean big dicks. Speaking of size, once in Asia they handed out rubbers. Kid size! Once we had a Filipino fitter. Put ball bearings in his cock to make it bigger. I've screwed on all 5 continents, and you'd be surprised. Especially in Asia. Huge dicks... Dirty Gertie likes them sturdy... And you, Captain? Nice night, wasn't it? I didn't do anything with her. There's only one woman for me. It's not easy, but I'm sticking to it. What is this nonsense? Love? I believe in friendship. You'll see. Your wife will become your best friend. Alice, as a woman, what do you think? As I woman, I'm not sure. But I can't live forever with a friend. I didn't mean that. My guy is my friend, obviously. But I want him to be my lover, my nurse... my patient, my bandit... my brother, my sun... You want it all. That's right. For me that's the definition of love. Everything. So? How was your present? Great. Go on... Tell me. You'll be disappointed. Nothing happened either. He read my future. He said I had several love lines. I'm on duty. - Thanks. - It was my pleasure. I love kissing you. No, you love when we kiss. Whenever I go on deck, I hope to cross paths with you. I think of you every night. Even when I barely see you all day. I think of Felix. When I left you, I thought about you for years. Everything I did, every ship, every guy, I did it for you. Thinking of you. Now I don't care. I love kissing you. It's easier now. We're both involved. Did you want me right away? Yes, right away. Hear anything? Yes. Your breathing. I can almost hear your heartbeat. Exactly. I don't hear the fans. Fuck, a blackout. Where were you? Didn't you hear the alarm in your cabin? We have to cut the engines! I'll try the other! I'll see why the emergency generator didn't kick in! Fuck! Is that you, Antoine? Come to the generator. No electricity anywhere! To us! Men... What a night. Want some? No, thanks. Alice, please show me the problem with the battery. CROSSING THE EQUATOR Bitch! Bitch! Come on, bitch! See the ass on her? I just want one chord. Your guitar's upside down. It's for lefties. First time I've watched you sleep. You didn't sleep? No, I feel great. Now that I have two guys, I don't sleep. I don't know how women manage with just one. Is your wife serious? Don't talk about her. How did you meet? And my guy is fair game? - What does he do besides cook pasta? - Graphic artist. He draws comics. He's been published once. Felix... Bjornsen. - Not translated? - They're doing it. It's coming out soon in French. The next one too. Well, well... I'm not into comics. A little bland, isn't he? He's cute. The first time we kissed, he licked me here. He said... "This is pretty." What happened? - You didn't have it before. - Yes, I did. It's a birthmark. It's like a smudge that won't rub off. I never noticed it. Yep. This is new. What did you do all these years? Maya and I did it all. Marriage, kids... house, trip around the world, sabbatical, everything. Your attention please. This is a reminder to set the clocks back one hour. It's as if the last hour never happened. Shall we start over? Too bad you won't stay on after Marseille. You remind me of my daughter. She works in the States. I haven't seen her in a year. I'll go see where they're at. October 25th. Today is Sunday. An idiot asked how many women I'd loved. He likes numbers. I don't dare say none. It's like a shameful disease. I'd like to love someone who occupies my thoughts. I finally spoke to Gaël. Between getting operated on and sailing, he'd have made the same choice. Thanks to him for letting me aboard with my tired heart that barely served. I need a haircut. Ask Antoine or wait for a port of call? You didn't pick up your report. Your chief likes you. Excellent grades. What happens at sea stays at sea. Going back to Maya? We're getting divorced. What? Why didn't you tell me? Why did you lie? I didn't want to spoil the fun. I'll call you after I disembark. Coast Guard... - Captain... - Men... Is this Patrick Le Gall's cabin? Yes, but his replacement is staying here, so... let's go to my office. I keep thinking you'll smell like the sea... but you smell like gasoline. Not gasoline, fuel oil. I love smelling you again. Thanks for the books. - This is for you. - How beautiful. You're crazy. I have a treasure too. I found it on board. The guy I replaced. You'll see. He talks well about life aboard. You see... There's something special with you. It's the first half hour. And during this first half hour, it's as if we're strangers. Like the first time I desired you. I'm like a madman. I recognize you and I don't. Then it's over. And I find you again. Do we have to see your parents? I'd like to spend a week on the coast. I'll borrow a car from them. - He does that well. - He does. Cut it out. Have some fruit! Mom, we're all full. Alice is the sea princess? How was it? Really good. Delicious. Louise, are you here? I'm always here. Your sister can live without a cell phone at sea! I don't know how... but it's cool being the only girl. Like an attraction! All alone. The only girl. And what do you want to do? Everything... or nothing. Too many choices. Who wants coffee? Me! What a great idea! I'd like one. Is that Gaël? Crazy sending me this. So what's the story? I had no idea... Can I have a puff? I know it's bad but it's so good. All well with Julien? Fair... He thinks I got fat. - No... - Yep. - Did I get fat? - Not at all. You're gorgeous. He keeps saying: fat pig, you're fat, you got fat... all daylong. Leave him. I can't. Not after 9 years together. Unlike you, my job doesn't thrill me. Gotta go back. End of cigarette break. See you later. So what's the story? How does Felix fit into all this? Why does it matter? I find him so handsome. I love him even more. There he is. I have to erase that photo. Don't ever tell him. Are you crazy? Serves no purpose. My God, it's true, I called you "my dear" Don't hold it against me butt can't remember We speak of memories but we forget so much... Please forgive me, my dear And let's not bring it up again My wife, if I'm telling you this, it's to tell you I love you And I can tell you, my wife, that I only loved you Okay... I have good news. I was made chief. That's great! Great! Thing is, I start tomorrow. My chief has a family problem. Last-minute replacement. That's less great. But it's a great promotion. Yeah, it's amazing. For how long? I have no choice. It's for 3 months. We'll go on vacation after. We'll celebrate with a good scotch I put aside. I'm so happy for you. It's great news. You'll miss the baby's baptism. I'm used to Christmas, but we planned around you. I know but what can I do? The baby won't remember! Of course he won't. To us. To you, Dad. To Alice's promotion! Did you sleep here? Up here. Rebecca slept below. - What are you doing? - Searching. Found it! - Don't drink that! It's old! - Dangerous? Delicious! Want some? Are you doing an orthodromic or a loxodromic line? No idea. The captain decides. Depends where we go. Remember what it means? I know. Tell me again. A loxodrome seems like the shortest distance between 2 points if you draw a line, but since the Earth is round, it's faster to draw a curved line. Orthodromic. I'm going to do a loxodrome to your ass but then an orthodromic line around you. I have to finish packing. Are you sulking? I'm sulking. I'm happy for you, but sad you're leaving so soon. So am I. We have to talk. Better to discuss naked. Sometimes I'm afraid I can't make you happy. What? It's true. I'm never around. I'll miss lots of important stuff. I'll never be a normal girl. Like your girlfriends before. Good. You're the first girl not to ask me what I "really" want to do. I'll always give less. And if less is more? When we see each other, we see each other. It's precious. Special moments. I'll have a new address. No need to pass via the captain. Shall we continue? I'll think of you. You'll think of me. I will, a lot. I saw you with the guy in the picture. I had a feeling it happened, but now it's concrete. You checked my phone? The picture is really... vile. Your skin on his... It's disgusting. If you want, I'll call and cancel. It's your first job as chief. Go on. We'll discuss it once you're back. Take care of yourself. I'd like to see if I can find anything of his. I told you I can't show you his cabin. Why not? There are things I have to see, because... I want to see where he was. I want to see where he lived. But there's nothing to see. We had to empty the cabin. Okay, I understand, but... I'd like you to explain something. How did he fall overboard if he was down below? - There was... - No, wait... The report is full of contradictions... The Coast Guard investigated. Like us, they called it an accident. I must I ask you to leave. We're casting off. I can't show you the cabin. Show me the cabin. Not that way, ma'am. Hands off me! I can leave on my own. You and that teacher's-pet face Who do you think you are? The cop report won't do. - Alice. - I'm Seb. Vali, our cadet. Show him around? Sure. Get the order? Believe it or not. The spare parts are on another boat. They're in Dunkerque. Another boat, my ass. Very happy you become chief engineer. We will make a ceremony about the Demonia. Get rid of bad spirits. A ceremony for...? They're going to make an offering. To the engine? Everything okay? Alarm by the bilge. Seb forgot to drain it again. Come see my photos. Ever see a naked black girl? You want to? I guess it's a guy thing. You're not the only one who gets to have fun here. What? Come on, it's no big deal. I like Gaël a lot. Everyone knows? I didn't tell a soul. It all worked out. You're chief. I'm second. Is that Le Gall? Isn't it strange no one saw the accident? Ever thought suicide? Impossible. You obviously didn't know him. He was amazing. Believe me, he loved life... He was funny. He had tons of success with girls. Everyone liked him. Were you really close? That was in Lomé. That was hardcore. You sure were close. Know the Chinese dragon? When you get a blowjob and you're on the point of cumming... you stick your cock way down, slam here and it comes out the nose. I'll leave you now. See you later. Did you tell anyone about us? Are you ashamed? How's the engine? Same problem with the 24-volt. The Company won't answer. Le Gall's wife doesn't stop... His sister. He didn't have a wife. Really? Pain in the ass! I have another problem... Last night I wasn't able to see you. Stop. I want to hear from you. Send me an email. I was wrong to give you that diary. Should go to his family. I'm coming. They're deadly. I've seen them in Africa. How did the son of a bitch get into the filter? Want the honor? Kill it! How's it going? Got a cigarette? I'm all out. Goodnight. It really is Christmas. I slept with my chief when I was a cadet. I was crazy about him. He was exceptional. I couldn't help myself. Enjoy the job? I could never make as much back home. And you? Enjoy making 4 times more than a Romanian? Marry a French girl. What about my girlfriend? Why don't you have a photo? I do, but I keep them hidden. I don't want anyone to see it and think of her after. She's so pretty. You're lucky. At your age I was afraid to fall in love. Of the exceptional guy? He's the one you love. So why sleep with me? To make sure I stopped loving someone else. That doesn't mean a thing. Look at me. I love my girlfriend. With you it's just a fling, and then... it'll be over. Back home we say every joint that cracks is a lover. Dirty Gertie is in great spirits! Seb, can you check the sludge tank? Ask Vali. Excuse me? Careful, Alice. Word will get out. I like you a lot. But what you did to Frederic wasn't cool. Felix, I want to send a real letter to touch you physically, but I don't know when I can send it. We're tramping: no fixed ports of call. The stock exchange sets our route. One day we're told to set off for England. But we have no recent map of the Thames. They say to head for Cherbourg but merchandise rates change and we head to Norway. I want to hear your voice at our next stop. I kiss you eyes, and your fingertips. Didn't you once tell me a chief shouldn't sleep with a cadet? You have to stop. Felix found out. Why have to? Does he decide for you? If he didn't know, what would you do? What do you want now? I want to kiss you, but it's not possible. What are you soared of? Of being unfaithful? You're gentle. Your unfaithfulness is gentle. I'm afraid of losing everything. But I'm here. It wouldn't be enough. Nothing doing, Alice. I'll always love you. Smoke at the generator. Fuck. Seb is at the incinerator. Call the deck! Seb! Don't worry! We're here! You okay? Take him out. Are you okay? Take him up. Everything's shut off? I think so. I'll cut the inlet valve. The fire is out. It had just begun. It's under control. No, no wounded. Seb is fine. Call you back. What the fuck? It may be a slow-down. I'll be at the control room. - Bearing temperature, number 4. - 5 and 6 too. - What's going on? - It won't shut off. Cut the engine! - Why won't it stop? - Let me. Yes... I have all that. For the blow to the head? Any danger? His eye? No, it wasn't touched. Gently, I understand. Got it. Understood. It'll be fine. It's an accident. Not your fault. I could have been me. We spoke to the Company. We have to go to Gdansk. They're not sending help? Surface wounds. No need to fly him out. We have everything we need. We'll try the other engine. Same cylinder head and no spare parts. They got us into this shit. Someone needs to get hurt to show them the problems. Felizardo is too scared to work on Demonia. I'll speak to him. We can go now because I prayed to the power of Jesus. I prayed to go. Any news from the Company, about Le Gall's sister? It'll be fine. Don't think about it. Gaël is a good guy. He does everything for his men, his crew. He was very fond of Le Gall. What he did was classy. You're lucky. Someone's waiting for you. That's what counts. I was never able to do that. Women need to be entertained. You need to laugh together. I can do that on at sea. Laugh with people, talk about everything... But I don't know, once ashore... I freeze up. I got a signal... Great, me too. Felix, I hope you get this message. I hope you're well. We had an accident here. I really need to know if you're okay. We'll be in Gdansk tonight. You can call. Take care. I'm cold. I want you to warm me up. Gaël? A little higher. I know. I don't know. I'll get changed. Wait for me. Not in your mouth. It's very toxic. Anything wrong? Are my breasts too small? Is there someone else? I'd thought I wouldn't care if you slept with another guy. But if we're equals, I had to try. Roxane? Fuck. Being with two girls is way too much for me. It's not easy to find someone you get along with. - Seems easy for you. - It's nothing. Passing fancies. There are guys everywhere. You're what grounds me. It's because I slept with Gaël that I chose you. Excuse me? I don't get it. I used to think we had just one great love. That it was him, that I missed out. Today you're my great love. You. I've never loved someone like this before. I screwed up because it's new. We can't know it matters. You were right to cheat. It'll pass. You'll go home and dump her. She won't even be sad. You talk too much. He's the opposite of you. He didn't know how to love. You can't stay a little longer? For once I'm the one who leaves. And you stay. It's good to see you but I need time to think. Feelings change all the time. You don't know me. I should have contacted you long ago to return this diary. Your brother's words are strange. What he called his dark side helped me shed light on my own life. I'd like to have shown you around the boat. But it's too late. We disembark tomorrow. The Fidelio will be scrapped. They destroy everything and get rid of all of us. I'll keep this. Want this, Vali? Cut it out, I have a girlfriend. Want it? Come on, they're presents. Sure. I like this man crying. I'd like to have left it for the next person. May I? Alice, let's go. Subtitles: Andrew Litvack Subtitling: Monal Group
