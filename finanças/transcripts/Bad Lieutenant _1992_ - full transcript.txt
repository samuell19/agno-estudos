Hey, folks, I know the Mets are down 3-zip in the best of seven. I know no World Series team has ever come back from 3-0 down to win four straight. I know they haven't played well. I know the pitching's been bad. I know "No clutch hitting" and no 86-69 seem a long, long time ago. And there's no Ruth, there's no Gehrig. Goodness gracious, there's no Donn Clendennon. But... you are not out of it until you lose four games in the best of seven. That is all there is to it. Back to the phones we go. Bruce is in Bayside. Bruce, how are you? How you doing, Chris? Good to have you aboard. What's up? Listen, I'm writing off this season. The Mets are out of it. They're down 3-nothing. They might as well pack their bags. Write it off? My concern is next year. What do you mean, write it off? Look at great teams of the past... the A's in '88, the Phillies back in the '50s, The Indians in '54 won over a hundred games. The following years, these teams were no good. All right... The Mets, they'll be out of it this year. Question! They need to worry about next year. Did the Indians in '54, say, after they lost the third game to the Giants, "Let's not show up for game 4? We've lost. Let's rebuild for next year"? They might as well have. Hey, the A's won in '89, and it's not easy to win every single year. This is a team that has proven they cannot win in the clutch. It's so obvious. Every year they... They won in '86, didn't they? They won in '86 because a guy couldn't field the ground ball. If I was on first base... How about the playoffs and the World Series? The Mets would've lost the World Series... - I wasn't even... - That is incorrect because the game was tied... Let's go! Let's go! Whoa! How many times you be late for school? Your sister gets to school on time. Huh? What's the problem with you guys? You want to be driven around like you're the president, like I'm your goddamn chauffeur. Dad, it wasn't our fault. Whose fault was it? Mine? No. Aunt Wendy told us to take out the garbage, and she hogged the bathroom. All morning. We couldn't get in there to brush our teeth or do anything. We had to wait till she got out. By the time we got out, the bus was gone. So how are we supposed to be on time? This is the only way we're gonna get there. Listen to me. I'm the boss, not Aunt Wendy. When it's your turn to use the bathroom, you tell Aunt Wendy to get the fuck out of the bathroom. What are you, men or mice? She's hogging the bathroom. Call me. I'll throw her the fuck out. ... every facet of the game. They're being outpitched, they're being outslugged, and they're being outfielded. They're also being outefforted, if there's such a word. They're going to lose 4-nothing. No, they're not. They're gonna win. Strawberry's fucking killing them. - They're going to lose! - Gonna win! Knock it off. David Cone will be the starter at game 4, and that has a lot of fans, myself... Strawberry's killing them. Not only will Cone be setting the pace... Go Coney! Yeah! All right! Knock it off, will you? Come on. Give me a goddamn headache. I know all five of those runs were not earned. I still don't think... Bye, Dad. Bye, Dad. Bye, Dad. See ya. Next two games in this series are at Shea. If they can win them and at least put some doubt in the minds of the Dodgers, that's what the Mets need. They need to prove that the Dodgers were not right, and also restore the confidence in the Mets are a dangerous team when they start believing in themselves. Jeff Torborg called a closed-door... Get some shots. I want some shots over here from this window here. Mikey, come here. I think we got some prints over here on the inside of this door. Right on the inside there. Try and get them. How you doing? I got, uh, two young girls, shot in the head twice each. It's kind of messy. Over here, Mikey. Get some pictures from the other side. I don't know if they're still wearing the rounds in their head or what. Hey, Mikey, get this back door over there. There's something on the inside. Around... In that door. Thank you. Anybody see anybody? Yeah. Hey, Dookie. We got this one Chinese guy over here who saw a couple guys running over these park benches towards Park Avenue. We got a pretty good description on the two guys. Uniformed guy put it on the air. We'll see what happens. Michael, on the inside of that door. And let me have some shots on the eye-level. Mets my ass. Dodgers are smoking, huh? Yeah, smoking. But what about tomorrow? What are you thinking? You like the Mets? What do you think of that shit back there? Terrible. You guys got money coming. What will you do? Dodgers all the way. I'd save your money. With Cone pitching? That Conehead motherfucker got whopped for his game. I wouldn't bury the Mets. Even money with Cone pitching? That's right. You don't think they're going to beat him twice, do you? You're right. Not only that, they're due, man. Put my 3 on the Mets. Even money. Listen, uh... take the 5. Put it on the Mets. You say that like it's a fucking death sentence. It's a smart bet. I think it is a fucking death sentence. Strawberry burns. Nah, man. He can't win four in a row. - No? - Three. That's it, max. - Max. - What about Strawberry? Yeah. Give me a cup of coffee. Don't... Don't put on the cover. Hello. Mike, how are you? What's up, guy? Here's what we're going to do. We took in 10,000 in action. We got 6 on the Mets, 4 on the Dodgers. Plus I want another 15,000 of my own on L.A. 15? But that's what you're up. Why don't you just go ahead? Hey, don't give me that bullshit. The Dodgers are a lock. Are you sure? Just put in the bet. I'm going to make some money. You got it, guy. Give me something to cook. What's up, man? Here we go. Thanks. Ooh! It's good shit. You can cut it in half. Shit's going to kill you, man. What the fuck are you, a drug counselor or a drug dealer?

Relax. Which one of you guys got the money? We ain't got no money. Empty your pockets out, the two of you. What is this, man? Empty your pockets. If we wasn't black, you wouldn't be doing this shit. It's him. It's him. Shut the hell up, man. - What's going on? - Arrest him. Uh, Lieutenant, sir, the owner says they stole cash from the register. - The owner's full of... - Shut the fuck up! He was chasing them down the block when I caught up with them. Get me a Bud, a High Boy. Make sure it's fucking cold. I'll straighten this out. - This is bullshit, man. - That's him. It's him. Arrest him. How much did they take? How much did they take? $500. You're out of your mind, man. Shut your... What the fuck? Take this guy down to the precinct and make out a report.

Your daddy will be right back. The door sticks. Just a second. Wow, you're just on time. Got some very, very fine brown shit for you. Yeah? Same you loved last time you were here. No, nobody there. Nobody. Here. Oh, where's your pipe? You ready? Here. This one is yours. Let's see. Where did I put the lighter? Here's the lighter. You got a lighter. I'll light my cigarette. It's lit. Oh, my God. I'll get you a little bit more here. Give me a little more. There you go. It's a big pile. No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! We'll do more than that We'll get rid of the cat All in favor say "aye" Aye! We did it before And we can do it again And we will do it again We've got a heck of a job to do And you can bet that we'll see it through We did it before And we can do it again And we will do it again We're one for all, and we're all for one They'll get a lickin' before we're done Millions of voices are ringing Singing as we march along We did it before And we can do it again And we will do it again We'll knock them over And then we'll get the cat... We did it before We'll do it again We did it before And we can do it again Please leave your message after the beep. The gangsterism has got to go We did it before, and we... Hi. It's David. Talk to you later. Hello? We'll put the ax To the axis good I already received it. Millions of voices are ringing Singing as we march along Hello? Hello? - We did it before - Hello? And we can do it again So with Brett Butler on third and Cal Daniels on first, Strawberry stands in against David Cone. Cone leaning in for the sign. He goes to the stretch. The pitch on the way, and it's a long high blast to right center field. Over the fence and off the scoreboard at Shea Stadium. Darryl Strawberry trucks it out around the bases. He hits one of those moonshots that have trademarked his career. Quite a clout, but maybe too little too late. A Mets 11-nothing lead is now 11-3. A three-run homer for Strawberry. His third home run of the series, and RBIs 10, 11, and 12. It's 11-3, Mets. No matter how far Strawberry hits a ball, he cannot drive in enough runs to get the Dodgers back in this game. Strawberry with the moonshot getting congratulations in the Dodger dugout. That brings Eric Davis to the plate, and right now all the Dodgers want to try and do is close the Mets out, gain some momentum back going into game 5. If they can make a little noise here, get some offense going... Give her a piece of cake. Mom, you okay? Have a little bit of cake. Hey, Strawberry, want a cup of coffee? Cone into the windup. Here's the first pitch. Have a cup of coffee with us. Davis again stepping out. Looks for the sign. Steps back in. You know, let's face it, folks. I know they got a ways to go yet. I know they have a ways to go. But the Dodgers blew a match point. Man believed shot. 153... I'll tell you something right now. The first one to get is always hardest to get when you're down by a large... Confirmed, man shot. 153 Jane Street. Hey, Veronica, baby, what's going on? There's a key somewhere in the back seat. Hey. What we got here is a black man with his throat cut. - Somebody look at him? - Yeah, probably. - Anybody check the car? - Not yet. - I'll check the car. - All right. Good. Hey, Sergeant. How are you doing? What do we got? I've got a black male with his throat slit. Looks like he's going to... Any weapons? Lieutenant's checking the seat now. How about any witnesses? First three uniform guys on the scene got wind of a possible drug deal. Let me see what the Lieutenant wants us to do. What's that? That's, uh, coke. Put it in evidence. Hey, I want you two guys to go contact your junkie friends on 25th Street till we get up. You two guys go over to them two pawnshops, see what else we can get. What's going on? They raped a nun in Spanish Harlem. Imagine having that happen to you. I would've killed these motherfuckers. They took the fucking chalice. The host was still in there. What they want with the host? What do you think, they were gonna eat the host? They wanted to pawn the fucking chalice off. Put up a $50,000 reward. Leave it to the Catholic Church. Girls get raped every day. Now they're gonna put up 50 Gs because these chicks wear penguin suits. What is your fucking problem? The Church is a racket. So what? Are you a Catholic? I'm a Catholic. Why don't you have a little bit of fucking respect? Hey, fuck that noise. How about them Mets, huh? Bet you won a shitload. More than you did. I want to get paid. What about tomorrow? What do you guys want to do? Want to make a bundle? Leave it all on the Mets. What, you think they're going to beat Martinez? The series has got to last seven games. You know how much money is riding on commercial time alone? A New York / L.A. team? When's the last time the Series in New York did not last seven games? You know the revenue alone in TV commercials? Endorsements for the players? The income it's bringing into the city for transportation? There are no fucking jobs in New York, are there? There's no way the Series can end tomorrow. Too many people want to milk it for what it's worth. Did I steer you wrong yesterday? Huh? Want to make a smart move? Leave it on the Mets. What do you want to do? I'm in. Are you a doubter? I'll tell you what, then. Don't listen to the way I steered you yesterday. All right? So you owe me money. What do you want to do? Dr. Sherman, 247. Dr. Sherman, 247. Can I help you with something? I'm in charge of the investigation. Just checking security. Security? Wouldn't want the guys coming back, would you? For the nun... or for you. Here are the soiled undergarments and the nun's habit. They're to be taken by you for evidence. Uh, now, black pubic hair other than the patient was found during comb inspection. Here are the samples of that. There was trauma to the vaginal mucosa with multiple lacerations that appear to be made with a sharp object... in which the hymen membrane was broken. It was stated that this object was a crucifix. Trauma consistent with multiple penetration. 3-centimeter laceration... Let the Mets be uplifted. Let the Mets have a nice dinner at home. Let the Mets look at the post-game highlights and see base hits all over the place. One bullet has been dodged! Just a couple more to go, and I'll tell you something right now... the longer this Series goes, the longer this Series goes, the Dodgers will get awfully tight, and if it somehow gets to game 7... You girls know you're driving with a taillight out? Oh, really? Yeah. No, we didn't know. But thank you for telling us. Let me see your license and registration. Huh? Hey. Where's your license? Actually, I don't have my license with me. You don't? No. Do you have a driver's license? No. You don't have it with you? Whose car is this? Listen, this is our father's car. We don't... We don't have... We don't have a license. Yeah? Does he know you got it? Yeah. He does? Does he know you got the car? Well, not exactly. - You being bad girls, huh? - But it is our dad's... You being bad girls? Huh? Where are you coming from? New Jersey. Yeah? Got any drugs in the car? No. No. No drugs? No. Where were you tonight? We were... at the Kat Club. Yeah? Yeah. Yeah. We went into the Kat Club. Big deal. I should take you in for driving without a license and registration. You know that, don't you? That's a serious thing. Huh? Have to call your father up. - Uh... - How do you feel about that? Don't... Don't do that. Yeah? What were you girls doing at the what, the Kit Kat Club? Get a little stoned there? Huh? Come on. I'm not going to... I'll do the right thing if you do the right thing. I know what it's like to get stoned a little bit, get high a little bit. You're getting stoned there? Huh? Have any grass there? Coke? We smoked a little grass. Yeah? How would your father feel if he knew you were here now? You won't tell him. Well, that depends. What do you think about that? Come on. A couple of very beautiful girls, you know that? Come on. Give us a break. C-Couldn't... couldn't you just give us a warning for not having... for the taillight and let us go home? Well, you know something? Two such beautiful girls like you, I could give you a warning. You want a warning? Well, here's the warning. You do something for me, and I'll do something for you. What do you say about that? You do something for me, and your father won't find out you took his car and you're driving without a license. Huh? You got a boyfriend? You got a boyfriend? No. You don't? I'll tell you something right now. Now listen up to me, okay? I'm going to take you down to the precinct house and call your father. You hear me? You hear me? You can't do that. What will you do for me if I don't do that? Whatever you say. Yeah? You can't call our father. You ever suck a guy's cock? Huh? Did you? Look at me. You... You ever suck a guy's cock? Hey. I'm talking to you. You ever suck a guy's cock? You serious? Did you? Did you? Well, yeah. So? Don't talk back. Don't talk to me that way. You hear me? Don't you talk to me that way. I'm going to haul your ass right in. I'm sorry. Just let us go. We'll get it fixed in the morning. I'll let you go. Turn around. I want to see your ass. Do you mind that? Just one look at your ass, okay? What do you say? Huh? You, come here. Look at me. Look at me. You ever suck a man's cock? Huh? You ever suck a guy... Look... Look at me. You ever suck a guy's cock? Let me see how you do it. Let me see how you do it. Show me your mouth when you suck a guy's cock. Come on. Show me your mouth. Show me your mouth. What's the big fucking deal? You've sucked guys' cocks before, haven't you? Come on. Show me how you suck a guy's cock. You hear me? Show me how you suck a g... Just turn around. Show me how you suck a guy's cock. I'm fucking serious. Show me how you suck a guy's cock. It's the last time I'm going to ask you, or I'm taking you in, you hear me? Show me how you suck a guy's cock. Show me with your mouth. Show me with your mouth. Come on. Spit that gum out. Give me the gum. Give me the fucking gum. Show me how you suck a guy's cock. Come on. Show me. Show me. Show me. Open your mouth.

You like sucking a fucking dick? Come on. Open your mouth. Open your mouth and take that fucking dick in your mouth. In your mouth, you little fuck cocksucker. You little fuck cocksucker, take it in your fucking mouth. Come on. Open up and take that fucking scum. Okay. Mmm. It's okay. He stopped. Let's go. Go gently with her. Sister, I can't imagine how you feel right now, but it's very important that we learn as much about what happened as possible so we can get this information out over the police radio. What can you tell me about what happened? Can you tell me how many of them there were? Can you tell me what color they were? Were they black? Were they white? Were they Hispanic? Can you tell me how old they were? Was one older than the other? There were two of them. Two young men. What can you tell me about the older of the two? Were there any distinguishing marks or tattoos? An earring? Did he have a beard or a mustache? Can you tell me how they were dressed? Sister, I know this is difficult, but I can't emphasize how important it is. The sooner we can get this information out over the... Here it is... ball 2 from Franco, and John Franco is struggling. He walked Carlos Hernandez. He got behind on Slope, who hit a single. He got behind on Butler, who lined out. It's now and 2 and 0. Daniels in a game situation here. Come on, Daniels. If he can work his way aboard... And the lowest balls once again, it's Darryl Strawberry as he has a chance to play hero once again for the Dodgers. But it's up to Daniels at this point. - From the stretch... - Come on, Daniels. Ball 3! Good eyes, good eyes. Take it, take your next one. ... a 3-0 count now. Daniels with Strawberry on deck. Strawberry already with three hits tonight. 2 to nothing for the ninth inning, and there's a strike. 3 and 1, the count is Daniels... All right, all right. Good move. Take the pitch. - Eyes, eyes. - ... 3 and 1. Come on, Daniels. Eyes. Use your fucking eyes. Two on, one out. Here's the 3-1 pitch. Ground ball to short. Could be 2. Flipped to second for 1, relay to first. It's a double play! You cocksucker! You fuckin' miserable fuckin' cocksucker! Piece of fucking shit! You fucking nigger! Fucking cocksucker! Oh... You fucking piece of shit! The body of Christ. Body of Christ. The body of Christ. Body of Christ. - The body of Christ. - Body of Christ. The body of Christ. Body of Christ. The body of Christ. The body of Christ. The body of Christ. The body of Christ. The body of Christ. The body of Christ. The body of Christ. The body of Christ. Congratulations, asshole. Now you owe him 30,000. Now what are you going to do? Go double or nothing on the next game. Double or nothing? What are you, out of your mind or what? No way I'm letting that bastard take my money. Take your money? Really? This guy's going to blow your house up with you and everybody else in it. There's no way L.A.'s going to lose this game. They're playing at home. Strawberry's ready to break out. Fuck Strawberry. You're gonna wind up owing this maniac 60,000. It's my business. Just place the bet. Body of Christ. The body of Christ. The body of Christ. Body of Christ. The body of Christ. The body of Christ. The body of Christ. The body of Christ. The body of Christ. Body of Christ. The body of Christ. Those boys... those sad, raging boys. They came to me as the needy do, and like many of the needy, they were rude. Like all the needy, they took. And like all the needy, they needed. Father, I knew them. They learn in our school, and they play in our schoolyard, and they are good boys. You knew them? Who are they, Sister? Who are the boys? Wh-What are their names, the names of these... good boys you knew? I could tell you their names now, and I know you are bound by a sacred vow to keep my secret, but I cannot tell you their names, for I, too, am bound. Jesus turned water to wine. I ought to have turned bitter semen into fertile sperm... hatred to love... and maybe to have saved their souls. They did not love me, but I ought to have loved them. For Jesus loved those who reviled him... and never again shall I encounter two boys whose prayer was more poignant, more legible, more anguished. Sid Fernandez and Darryl Strawberry... a battle of wits and talent here in the bottom of the ninth in Los Angeles. Strawberry readies himself. Fernandez checks for the sign. The pitch on the way. Swinging. Strike 1. 1 and 1 on Strawberry, as Fernandez came in with that fast ball, and Darryl could not connect. 1 and 1 the count. Two outs. Bottom of the ninth. For Los Angeles, men on second and third. The Dodgers find themselves down by 3 and in need of one of those Darryl moonshots. The 1-1 pitch from Fernandez. Swinging. Foul ball, off to the third base side. 1 and 2 the count to Strawberry now as he once again walks around, thinks about what he might see on this next pitch from Sid Fernandez. 1 and 2 to Strawberry. New York Mets trying to do something that no other team has ever done... come back from a 3-nothing deficit in a best of seven Series. Strawberry is ready. So is Fernandez. Ease to the belt. The 1-2 pitch to Strawberry. On the way. High and outside, it's now 2-2. So the string runs a little bit longer. The tension builds here in Los Angeles as Strawberry and Fernandez battle. Dodgers trying to eliminate the Mets. The Mets trying hard to send this Series to a seventh and final game. Fernandez wants to change baseballs now. He gets another one back from the home plate umpire. It's now a 2-2 count in a game situation. Once again, no team has ever come back from a 3-nothing deficit to come back and win a Series. That's what the Mets are trying to accomplish here. Strawberry, with that big year this year for the Dodgers, trying to continue his hot hitting in this playoff. So it's lefty against lefty, old teammate against old teammate. Strawberry steps in. Fernandez to the stretch. The pitch. He goes around... did he go around? The appeal at third... Yes! Darryl Strawberry, on the check-swing, goes too far. He strikes out. This game is over, as Strawberry goes down looking, and the Dodgers are looking at a Mets team that has tied the Series at 3. Oh, what drama on a 3-2 pitch, and a third base umpire said yes, sir, he did go around, and the expression on Darryl Strawberry's face says it all. We're tied at three games apiece, and the Mets win 8 to 5. This sets the scene for one heck of a seventh game. Pitching-wise, it's a match made in a fan's dream. Imagine... one game, and it's Dwight Gooden against Orel Hershiser. Neither pitcher is as powerful as he once was. Some of that magic removed by a surgeon's knife. But they are still pressure pitchers who know how to get it done, possibly to a future Hall of Fame... Hey. Hey. Yo. Whoa. Come here. You know, it's good to see you. The world is yours. Hey, Tommy, can I have some drink tickets? It's not like the old days. Hello, fellows. Yeah, Papa. Move it! Yeah, get moving. Help yourself out, okay? If you're doing a hit, do a monster. Come on. Here. Do mine. - Hey. - Come on. How many drinks did you have? Good. Hey, you got the money? What money? Stop fucking around. Did you bring the money? Got it with you? I don't got it. Not tonight. You can't get blood from a stone. Did you bring the money with you? This ain't no fucking joke anymore, seriously. Just put $120,000 on tomorrow's game. You're a fucking joke. You know that? Sweetheart. You make me laugh. Can I get a vodka on the rocks? He's been waiting since the game ended. You got me waiting here three hours like a fucking moron. What is it, a fucking big game or something with you? I'm going to win. You just make sure the fucking bet's in. I told you once before that this guy will come by your house and blow your house up with your wife and kids and everybody in it. Good. Good. I'll give him an extra 10 grand for his trouble. I hate that fucking house. You think maybe because you're a cop, he won't kill you? You're this close already to death. I been dodging fuckin' bullets since I was 14. No one can kill me. I'm blessed. I'm a fucking Catholic. How's the case going? What case? What case? The case with the $50,000 reward, remember? Yeah. We're on it big time. Lots of leads. You could use that 50 to get out of this hole. The Dodgers are going to win the Series. The Dodgers... It's a fucking lock. Get this, man. I was at the game today, face to fucking face with Strawberry. And... And... And I knew that he struck out on purpose... and that he's saving it up for the big one tomorrow. Today, for the first time, I understood that... You're sick in the fucking head. that it never could have gone any other way. Never could have gone any other way. You just put in my fucking bet... $120,000 on the last game... the big one. Come on. You a bookmaker fuck or what? I'll tell you the truth, be honest with you. I'm fed up with this. Here. I'm going to give you this guy's number. You call him yourself. You tell him what the fuck you want. Put your own bets in from now on. Judas. Hey, you leaving the sinking ship? Here. Take that. I'll give you a sinking ship. It ain't no joke. Tell me something. You could pay 60. You lose, you'll be in for 120 to a fuckin' dago who'll kill you for nothing. Yeah. Keep laughing. He didn't even have the 60. It's now 1:00. Better be careful getting home. Turn on the stud machine. Ooh, fucking yeah! You spell it T-O-O. I'm sorry. T-double-O, T-double-O. That's absolutely right. Hey, what's up, man? Come on in. How you feeling, man? Come on in. Come on in. Come on. Come on. Eat something. It's dinnertime. Come on. Go help your sister with her homework. Come on. Hurry it up. Excuse me. Make yourself at home. Make yourself at home. Sit down. I know, I know. Momentito, Mama. 14 across is a three-letter word. $30. "Passing fancy." Fad.

Uh, give me the definition in three words of a river in Central China. - I know... - Hawaii? - What is it? - 15 seconds... You have 10 seconds left. Han. Is it H-A-N? That's it. You're right, John. Gracias. Are you going to be all right, man? Yo? Yeah. - You sure? - Yeah. I got it. I got it. I... I tell you, man, you better take it easy. You take care, man. Large? I want my money. It's still my money. If you want Chess to have any part of it, shithead, you will take my bet... for $120,000 on tomorrow's game. What about the money you owe me from yesterday's game? Fuck yesterday's game! The Series is seven games, not... not six! Put in my bet! I'll think about it. There's nothing to think about. Either you put in my bet, or you get nothing. Really? Yeah. Really, I'm no fucking asshole. I'm a fucking cop! All right. You meet me tomorrow in front of the Garden, 33rd and 8th. You bring your cash, I'll bring mine. There we are. Oh, it's a beautiful vein. All right. Vampires are lucky. They can feed on others. We got to eat away at ourselves. We got to eat our legs to get the energy to walk. We got to come so we can go. We got to suck ourselves off. We got to eat away at ourselves till there's nothing left but appetite. We give and give and... get crazy. How does it get to make sense? Ain't worth it. Jesus said 70 times 7. Hmm. No one will ever understand why... why you did it. They'll just forget about you tomorrow, but you got to do it. Hershiser leans in for the sign. Ease to the belt. His pitch to Bonilla. Ball, outside. Orel Hershiser does not have his good stuff. He has struggled the entire four innings. Dwight Gooden leads off third. Vince Coleman on first, dancing back and forth, trying to distract Hershiser, who's having enough trouble concentrating on his pitches at this point. Ease to the stretch. Here's the 1-0 pitch to Bonilla, and Bonilla rips it down the third base line. It's rolling toward the corner. Gooden scores easily. Now the ball's bouncing around in the corner, and Coleman is tearing around third. He'll score. Bonilla around second, holds up, goes back into second with a double. The Mets lead 5 to nothing. 5 to nothing, and you got to wonder if the Dodgers can ever recover from this deficit. That should be it for Hershiser. In fact, Tommy Lasorda's coming out of the dugout right now. Before he even reaches the mound, he is motioned to the bull pen. And in in relief, comes Ramon Martinez. Lasorda using every arm he has available to try and win this Series. Meanwhile, the game competitor... Listen to me, Sister. Listen to me good. The other cops will just put these guys through the system. They're juveniles. They'll walk. Get it? But I'll beat the system and do justice. Real justice... for you. I have already forgiven them. Come on, lady. These guys put out cigarette butts on your... Get with the program. How could you... How could you forgive these motherf... these... these guys? Excuse me. How could you? Deep down inside, don't you want them to pay for what they did to you? Don't you want this crime avenged? I've forgiven them. But... do you have the right? You're not the only woman in the world. You're not even the only nun. Your forgiveness will leave blood in its wake. What if these guys do this to other nuns? Other virgins? Old women who'll die from the shock? Do you have the right to let these boys go free? Can you bear the burden, Sister? Talk to Jesus. Pray. You do believe in God, don't you? Ohh... That Jesus Christ died for your sins? What? You got something that you want to say to me? You fuck. You ratfucker. You ratfuck! Here's your... What? Say something. I know. You're just standing there. What am I going to do? Ohh... You gotta say something! Something! You fuck! You fucking stand there, and you want me to do every fucking thing? Where were you? Where the fuck were you? Where were you? Where the hell were you? I... I... I'm sorry. Oh, I'm so sorry! I'm sorry! I did so many bad things! I'm sorry! Oh! Ohh! I tried to do... I tried to do... the right thing, but I'm weak. I'm too fucking weak! I need you to help me. Help me! I need you to help me. Forgive me. Forgive me. Forgive me, please. Forgive me, Father. Quite a match-up here. Ramon Martinez against Howard Johnson... the power pitcher and the fastball hitter. Vince Coleman is leading off third base. Bobby Bonilla off first. Ho-Jo has not had much success against Martinez. I stole it from my husband's shop so's I could return it to where it ought to be. It's a holy thing. A holy thing. Which way is it? The boys right across the street there. Julio and Paulo. It's a holy thing. A holy thing. Ho-Jo with his best, his fastball, Ho-Jo set... ... and everybody else had high hopes for the Dodger club. There's a great deal of talent here, but they just can't seem to keep it together. Freeze. Put your hands in front of you. Put your hands out in front of you. Get out of here. Way back it may go. Gone. A home run for Mike Scioscia... You, get out. Well, Scioscia seemed to wait on the pitch, drove it the other way. Good piece of hitting by the Dodger veteran. And the remaining Dodger fans, well, they finally have something to cheer about. The Dodgers must've been wondering if they could do anything right today. Put them on. Lock it. What's your name? Julio. What's your name? Paulo. David Cone is on, in relief, for the New York Mets. Upside and high, ball 1. Sid Fernandez and Pete Schuring are both getting ready in the bull pen. Cone knows, with this big lead, he has to throw strikes. Here's a pitch on the way, breaking ball over called strike. José appeared to be taking... Put your hands up there where I can see them. And the pitch is thrown outside and high. Ball 2. José seemed to be swinging away, but wisely he laid off. Now David behind in the count 2 and 1. Up by seven runs, David just wants to throw strikes. Nothing's been real easy for either team in the Series. Cone into the windup. Bunted! Give me a light. And now the Mets need just one more out. You'll want a replay to see that ball bounce right on the plate, making for the easy play. A lot like Coleman's hit in the fourth, but Coleman's ball must've gone 30 feet in the air. Now it's going to be Lenny Harris representing the Dodgers' final hope. Harris, at 225... Hold it. Want some good shit? Yeah. Pitch thrown to Len Harris. Strike 1. Harris, like many of these Dodgers, came out on fire when the Series opened, but seems to have just disappeared. Of course, Met pitching has had a lot to do with that disappearance. In the clutch, the Mets pitcher just could not be denied. Mets are now all standing on the dugout steps in anticipation. Pitch thrown is ball 1. Lenny Harris thought about it, he laid off. And the count's even at 1 and 1. At this point, well, it looks like the Met fans... Put your hand up there where I can see it. ... here at Dodger Stadium. You can see pockets of Met rooters all around the stadium, and they're already celebrating. Foul ball coming back and out of play. Now David Cone... Give me a light. needs one more strike to complete the most amazing comeback in playoff history. I'll never forget the '86 championship against the Astros, but this one has to be the best. Everyone, but everyone, had counted them as out, and now they're just one strike away from winning it all. You know, this whole thing is really unbelievable. Here we go. 1 and 2 the count. Cone has his sign. The windup and the pitch on the way. Strike 3 called! The Mets win it. Harris doesn't like it, but it's all over. The Mets have won the championship, and the Mets are the first team ever to come back from a 3-nothing deficit to win a playoff for a World Series. The Mets are on the field. Jeff Torborg in the middle, a very happy man. What a job he's done for the team. Dwight Gooden gets the victory with an aid and assist from David Cone in the eighth and ninth innings. Well, you can't believe it. The Mets are going on to the World Series. The Mets make history. Not only have they won the National League Championship Series... You raped a holy thing. You destroyed that young girl, and she forgives you. You hear that? She forgives you. You fucking heroes. You like holding her down and shoving your dick into her while she couldn't do nothing about it? Did you like that? Watch this, motherfucker. - No. - Here. Watch this, you cocksucker! Look at that. You can't do a thing about that, can you? Can you? Look at me. Can you? Can you, fuckface? Can you? Go ahead. Move. Move, you cocksucker. Move. I'd like to blow your fucking face apart. Fucking scumbags. You fucking scumbags. And she forgives you. How could she forgive that? How can she forgive you slimy little bastards? How could she forgive a thing like that?
