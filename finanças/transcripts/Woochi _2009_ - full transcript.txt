CJ Entertainment and United Pictures present a ZIP CINEMA production Produced by LEE Eugene a CHOI Dong'-hoon film In the beginning man and beast dwelled peacefully on the earth Goblins were held within a dark, heavenly prison The mighty Arch god blew The Pipe for 3000 days and repressed the goblins The prison doors had to be opened on the 3000th day but by the miscalculation of three lowly Taoist gods they were opened one day too soon. Did we get the date wrong? Something?s wrong. It's been 3000 days... Right? Just then, the evil within the goblins was awakened and these evil forces engulfed the Arch gods Pipe. All of the goblins desired to be The Pipes master. Having lost The Pipe the Arch god was consumed by evil and fell to the earth. - Arch god! '- What do we do? - Your Highness! '- Arch god, sir Your Highness! Yes, a monk catching goblins. I see... So why didn't you exercise with the others yesterday? I'll let you in on something. Human life is up to the stars. But they think it's DNA these days. Is exercise really that good? Lots of old people die from overexertion, but they keep jogging anyway. You might disagree, since You're a doctor. MEGALOMANIA Must have been fun being a god. Not past tense. I still am a god. It's a duty, not fun Were all the same. We all laugh and cry Get annoyed. Lose hope every few centuries. So I made a pill to forget everything. And I took it. Aches here and there, memories fading... Then I wandered the streets. It says that you were homeless. Solely out of choice. Good'-looking boy there. But I come here and get more pills. So I took them. These antidepressants. But laced with dopamine. These counteracted my pill. So now my memory is back, as a god. And what did you do when you were a god? I told you, I'm still a god! We look for goblins. And then go ask him to catch them. This will hurt. The wound will settle by tomorrow. Thank you, sir - How old are you? '- Nine years old, sir Oh... Well now, take good care of your grandfather, - all right? '- Yes, sir. What about me? What about my wound? Yes, of course Going somewhere? I am. But you'll only get half. I see. Why are you empty'-handed? I'm sorry, Master The young fool couldn't be more unruly or violent, sir The wound is not deep. Seems the fool was quite gentle with you. Prepare to set off. I see your students are getting roughed up. Yes, I sent them to bring an arrogant young wizard so that I could set him straight. Such students can only be of little help... I have yet to perfect my teachings. But if only it weren?t for those three ridiculous gods. After 3000 days they couldn't wait one more. And just opened the doors. You know them, right? We know them very well. Great tea! Indeed! It just tickles one's taste buds. Frankly, It's just hot Because it's supposed to be. It's getting dark. Let us hurry. Why don't you finish your tea first? It's quite good. Sure I rushed it, didn't I? Consumed by evil the Arch god and goblins fled to the earth and hid in human bodies. They no longer remembered their pasts or true identities. Rumors spread that only the one with The Pipe could rule the goblins. So you've finally found the Arch gods Pipe? They say a wizard in Jeonra Province discovered it four days ago and was soon murdered. There was green blood all around the scene and we?ve followed that blood here. I will capture the goblin and return The Pipe to you. We can't since we made a mista... - Not that '- Of course not. Please guard The Pipe Master Hwadam. We cannot trust these other petty wizards. No, of course not There's something up on the roof. Arrow. Is it a goblin? - I Don't... '- Just shoot it first. Wait a second. Only goblins run on roofs at this time of night. - Master Hwadam, shoot it '- No, wait - Is it a goblin? '- Just one minute. - Wait. Wait. '- I'm looking... But it wouldn?t be running around in goblin form... Goblin! It's a goblin! Master Hwadam! Shoot it! Compose yourself for a god?s sake! A talisman? Did you ask anyone else to catch the goblins? Of course not. And is this arrow not ours? - It was stolen. '- By whom? That scoundrel Woochi. Woochi? WOOCHI Here comes His Grace the Prince of the Heavens! Show him your respect! King of the land have you sent ten thousand gold coins to the areas of famine? Yes, your Grace Just as you had commanded in my dreams. You needn't worry, my lord The Heavens smile upon your good deeds. Whence you return to the Heavens sevenfold seventy seven hundredfold will you be repaid. I have also brought out the royal treasures as you requested. Brighter than you look, earthly king But where are all the maidens? Why for the maidens, my lord? Why not? The Heavens frown upon idleness. They may as well pour me a drink. I do not care for this music. How many times do you visit the stalls each day? May I humbly inform you... Don't be so humble. Tell me, girl Once every three days. And you? Thrice a day, your Grace Healthy girl you may pour my drink. Earthly king raise your head. I have always delighted in painting. When I paint a tree it begins to grow. When I paint a beast it leaps out of the parchment. Such talent wasting away! What say you? The painting breathes life and greatness, my lord! And that Ione horse seems to symbolize the solitude of man! - That's absurd. - You are right... - It is a horse for the wizard Woochi - Yes, a horse for the wizard Woo... Woochi? - Woochi, the scoundrel? - So you've heard of me! I can't go anywhere now with all this tiring fame. You dare mock the king you lowly trickster? Watch it. I am a wizard. What is a wizard, you ask? A ruler of the winds a bringer of rain on dry lands who leaps through space and governs the world with a swift blade but handles that sword like a gentle flower. A wizard's duty is to aid the helpless. The head is where all decay begins! The king and his subjects have failed the starving people. Thus I, the wizard Woochi, am here to do their bidding. I do not expect praise for this mind you. I wonder what will happen to you if I strike the neck of this bottle. I will be taking the kings mirror. Order all the wizards of the land to catch this imbecile Woochi! Let me see, now Woochi. It's tonight. The widows going to the temple. Now all we need is the bronze knife, right? Just kidnap a widow for them and well get the knife, eh? Don't look. You'll regret it if you see your true self. Jerk. Such greatness a wizard has with the mirror and knife in his hand! - Did you see her? - Sure did Just the back. But boy was it delicate and fine! And a woman is no woman without a fine back. You really saw Master Hwadam? I saw him soar through the sky! Husband died on their wedding night. That's why Hwadam of the West is best! - Why, he treats the sick and - Well, now I heard a more renowned wizard from Pyongyang resolved the famines... Nonsense. Hwadam of Kaesong is the best. They have wizards in Pyongyang? I think his name was Woo... something. Hey, Master said never to reveal our names! - A nobleman by the name of... - Woochi, you imbecile! That's it. Woochi! The great Master Hwadam has sent us here to bring you to justice for deriding the king and stealing ten thousand gold coins! Scoundrel! Need a hand? I'm fine. There?s one missing. Could Hwadam still be the best? No, sir Your name, great nobleman? The name of this wizard you see... Good sir! What am I to do with my tavern in ruins? - And what am I to do? - Pay. How much? Twenty silvers! I seldom carry money on me. - We beat them! - I beat them. It was a joint effort. You hit and I threw! Let's go! To kidnap that widow. Here? But my back is acting up lately. Don't make me tie you to the backyard again. But the smoke is bad for my sinuses. Hey, look at that! A widow will curse a household. Should you fail, use this We won't, madam I'll find some men to take along as witnesses We will be back soon It won't take long, my lady Were gathering more men. Okay. You're climbing that mountain of death? People go up, but no one ever comes back down. I'll join you. I've got nothing better to do. You may be tall, but you Don't look too strong. I may not be strong, but I can wield a sword. - But you Don't have one - Right you are. I need a sword. Darn fool. He thinks as if he were Woochi. Ah, Woochi! Although not as brave as he I will still join you. My back is killing me. When are we taking her? Just over that hill now. Get them! Bandits! Nurse! What is this? Are they after the widow? How about this? You go get the widow while I take care of them. Hurry and turn me back. Come on! Snap those fingers! Go learn some skills instead of wasting my time! Nurse! Get out of my way! I... I'm... No, wait... I'm... Nurse! Help me! Cursed is the widows household! - Why are you? - Cursed is the widows... Are you all right? Why do you keep following me? Well, it's not an easy thing to say. I've come for you... Me? For me? Yes. You have... - feelings for me? - Yes. What? Please tell me. Do I have a place in your heart? Somewhere... - Around here... - I knew it. I always sensed that someone like you would come. That is a lovely scent... While I'm catching all the bandits you're over here celebrating at a time like this? A widow will curse the household! What is she rambling about? Wow. She's a looker! Pray tell who is this gentleman? That is no man. Only a beast. Only figuratively speaking, of course. Call me Chorangyi. You even smell nice! Hug me too, please. Such uncouth company can only do you harm, good sir I can't agree with you more. Uncouth? Just hurry and wrap her up. Nice guys like us are a rare breed, lady Good work. I guess Fathers hip has healed already. Tell me where the bronze knife is. Oh, that. A wagon of birthday gifts went to the dukes mansion. Must have slipped in there. Well, I told you where. The duke? Should we go there then? The word of a learned man seldom has much value. I'm the nurse! Who are you, intruder? Compliments on the fine hearing, old man There should be a nice bronze knife here somewhere. You brought me the wrong girl, fool No, you just chose the wrong person Assassins! Protect the master! What are you doing with that? Don't! Assassin? Don't be ridiculous. No one's killing anyone! Quit bouncing back and forth! Where's the bronze knife? - What's this? - What is it? Have you any idea who he is?! That creature is not your father. How dare you! Father... That knife?! Seize them immediately! He's trying to dig me a grave tonight. Why is he following me? I see. Time for me to change! Can't see! Are you okay? Of course! Where'd that dirty rat run off to? Gosh, he's fast Woochi! Look out! Back! Woochi! Why I oughta... Woah! Hot! Woochi! You fool! Woochi! Woochi! Get up! Woochi! - You wicked little... - Woochi... There goes another perfectly good talisman. I thought you were really dead! Get that away! Now I've seen it all. Why, that one's a rabbit! Get out of the way! That little... I'll get you. Oh, yeah! The arrow! Huh? - Woochi? - The scoundrel? A talisman... Is the East Priory still? Well get to that. First let us get The Pipe! I believe that goblin will not have The Pipe. Two goblins captured," and yet still no Pipe! This is impossible. A wizard and a strange man were seen running away with The Pipe. Master! Why not just use a spell and save yourself the trouble, sir? My boy... Magic is only an illusion. Gathering roots has no need for it. Silly me! That goblin blew this Pipe and summoned another goblin? Yes, Master And the goblin made you bring him that widow? Uh-huh. Why did you kidnap her for him? Well, because... Woochi said not to tell you. Was he after that mirror and knife again? No! And you followed thinking he?d make you human. The book says those things will make him the strongest wizard. Then he can make me human. Two dull peas in a pod. It's not enlightenment he seeks. Only fame. Precisely, Master That's why I asked him how he could be so arrogant. But he says Why can't we live amongst men and enjoy life? That old fart knows nothing. That's you, Master And I tried and tried to stop him but he's so stubborn. To shun Taoist solitude and dream of Confucian success is just a waste of a dream. If you Don't know that you Don't know reality and you Don't know what you really know. You know? What in the world are you saying? Master... Master are you all right? I was avenging your death in my dream. What's wrong with him? Even he must have a conscience, Master I kissed the widow, too And he's still a bit drunk. I send you on errands but instead you go to the palace. You dare ridicule the king and start brawls with goblins! And even kidnap a widow? It's what we wizards do, old man We wizards? I will say this only once. You do not possess the makings of a true wizard. All in due time, Master. Have some patience. But why not? You do not know how to empty your soul. Honestly, is that even possible?" What do you do after a meal? I start digesting. After a meal you must first wash the empty plates, you fool Where are we? The temple of the closed East Priory. Shall we? - Wait here. - Yes, Master. You can't just walk in here. Get out! What is this? Are you the fool that calls himself Woochi? Who do you think You're... You're speaking to the great Master Hwadam. Master Hwadam what brings you here? - You... - Me, sir? - You're not a man... - Well, I'm many things... A dog I take it You're Woochi It's useless trying to hide one's name from fame. Good character is fundamental in training one's mind and spirit. To bring peace to this world... I've already had enough lessons today. The insolence being uttered in front of such virtuous presence! Think before you speak. We are holy Taoist gods. Are you glaring down at us? You look ready to even hit us! Go ahead, hooligan Try me. A fly! Atrocity! There was no fly! A mole. A true wizard does not disturb the peace with pranks! Where is The Pipe? Do come inside for some tea. Yes, some tea. How did he know that I'm a dog? Master Hwadam. Impressive. Didn't you just see him running away? The spiritual discipline of the East Priory is now taught with magic tricks? I have taught him nothing. He mastered them on his own. Rain is bound to pour through your torn roof, sir Yes, but it also let's in the sun The sun... A true wizard is said to be one with nature and the heavens I hope to become the light for this world. I believe Master Hwadam of the West wishes to acquire The Pipe. Our three gods have requested my services and it also troubles me to trust other wizards. A worry that we share. There could very well be a goblin among us wizards. I was told that the blood of goblins is green, sir - Goodness gracious! - Gentlemen, please! What shall we do... I've heard that only Taoist gods can reattach this pipe. Yes, that's correct. Then this is fortunate. Now we need not worry about goblins. Dividing The Pipe in half... - This also works. - That's true. Yes, it does So you really kissed the widow in your dream? - Worked out well. - Yes. Are you up, my lady? Yes, good sir Chorangyi, show our guests out Yes, Master Don't forget this, sir - Good dog - Gosh, that water was cold! Should I go and drag that mutt back? Send the woman back home. She will die if she goes back! Keep away from her, for she is more than you can bear. My head! What did you mean when you said I'll only get half? Don't ask me what you already know! Why are you saying that I already know the answer? Hwadam will get The Pipe! You'll get it all right. But after a moment you will wait for ages. If the peach blossoms Don't bloom on your side. Peach blossoms? Impudent old hag! I am a man of spiritual enlightenment! What good is enlightenment? You Don't even know your own self. Where did that old woman come from? She was a shaman but her mind is fading... Hwadam will get The Pipe! He is quite the foolish creature but will take you safely home. Thank you for your kindness. No need, Madam Master. Why must I keep away from her? She will lead you to your grave. - Sir? - Focus, you ninny! Feet off the eaves. Yes, sir Feet off the eaves. Good sir! Thank you for everything! Yes, my lady See you again. Why is my blood... What is it? The tea you asked for, Master - Put it over there - Yes, Master - Green blood. - I saw it too. An empty household. Is someone there? What's that sound? There, there It's okay. I was so startled! Is the horse treating you well? It is indeed a strange creature. It won't go forward and just keeps eating. That's all this filthy swine knows to do. I've spoiled him too much. When will he learn? I've spoiled him too much. Have you come because you were worried for my safety? It is no matter for I will protect you. Dying doesn't seem so bad compared to my tedious life. I am just sad I have yet to see the ocean. - Would you like to see it? - Now? Come down, my lady Take a deep breath. And let it out. Why? Because this... is the ocean! This... is this the ocean? Of course. But Don't go into the water. What lies beyond the end? Well, there... There's more ocean. So this is your first time as well. Rather, it is just that when I look at the ocean I wonder how I will empty my soul who I truly am how I shall live... As do I. If I am born again I?d like to be a commoner. I would dance and sing... No more sewing or reading books. What is this sound? Did I chant the wrong spell? You mustn?t go into... How did? Well, I am a wizard What exactly is a wizard? He is a ruler of the winds. A bringer... You shouldn't get too close. But he's very sweet. He's a real filthy one. Oh my! It's okay. I'm very clean. - Are you all right? - Hey, she likes me I know women. She likes me. How would you know that? I felt it through my back. Allow me, my lady. He's a dog, not a steed Want to try me without those talismans? You little mutt. Please stop! Men become friends just as easily as they become enemies. Save the fairy tales for humans. You really should see someone about that rash temper. Master told me not to use violence Forgive me, Master I'll try to be gentle. Are you all right? Oh, of course Nothing to worry about. Have a seat, maam It won?t take long. Hey, relax your muscles! It's gonna break! I said, relax Call me a mutt in public? This is animal brutality! What is he? I keep him around for amusement but he mostly just amuses himself. I see. To heck if I give this back to you now. You're not the only one that can do magic with talismans! Are you all right, sir? Yes, I'm fine. What happened to emptying your soul, huh? How can anyone empty their soul, you idiot? I Don't have to take this treatment. He's actually helpless without these talismans. - You want to bet? - Sure. Fine. I'll knock this over. Some other time. Shall we? Yes. What's wrong with him? The half-pipe has devoured Hwadam. Now do you see your true self? I am Hwadam. And I am the master of The Pipe. The Pipe now answers to no master. Even the great Arch god himself. If you would a token of your feelings... A token? Token... It is quite handy if You're to meet again. Oh, not this one It is evil to the core. Some other token. Woochi the scoundrel? That's right. I'm Woochi, the scoundrel I have defeated not only the king but many a deceitful noblemen. Should this woman ever be saddened I will surely return. Also, if she is forced to read or forced to sew I will surely return. Do you hear me? Yes. Will she be all right? Sure. They won?t touch her after the psychotic fit just now. Now we just need to find the bronze knife, right? Then You'll become the greatest wizard - and I'll finally be real human - Poor, oblivious mutt... Ingrate! You dare slay your master and steal the sacred Pipe?! Five hundred years in captivity will teach you a lesson! What are you talking about? Slay my master? See? I told you he?d say that. We?ve got him shackled so let us seal him in. How could we possibly hurt Master? Is Master okay? What?s happening? That is Masters fan... You mustn?t make your master wait for you any longer. Please, help me! I didn't get to pee yet! Shoot? Shoot the zither case? Hwadam! The Pipe! You're not supposed to seal The Pipe, too! You should?ve stopped halfway! You sound as if I was the only one chanting. At least goblins won?t appear for the next five hundred years. Another five centuries to go in order to see the Arch god again. What happens if the Arch god blows The Pipe? Why, the world will be healed!" Goblins will fall to hell," and the mighty Arch god will rise once again. And we can finally return to the heavens. But after a moment, you will wait for ages. Master Hwadam. Where are you going? The gourd bottle. - If the goblins return, - Wait, Master Hwadam... we will meet again. Yes? Did you send them up? Okay. You must be happy. You have visitors. And You'll hospitalize me afterwards? Yes. Just think of it as a nice vacation. But I'm too busy. - Should I take him, Doctor? - Yes. What?s keeping you so busy, sir? Just many things to take care of. Very bad! Hold out your hand. Why? You can't see he's cheating on you, that's why! I'll only hit you twice. Whenever he goes to Pusan now he's going to the other woman. The reason why your husband is cheating is... You, you crazy old wench! The dead cat on your back is scaring them away! On my back? I didn't say my back, did I Too many sins in your past life. You killed the emperor! Poisoned his coffee! Don't ever make coffee again. Next. - How much should I... - This filthy talk of money! Leave all of that dirty money here. What? Behind you... Leave now. Hello? Holy Jesus! Why would it break? If only Master Hwadam were still around. We haven?t seen him for ages. Last I heard he was on Mount Jiri. Let's just do it ourselves. We can't possibly catch them ourselves! Why the hell not? But there are two goblins? They slipped inside two humans. Came out of their skins. Didn't I tell you that I found them? I see. Where did you find these skins? In front of the hospital. The hospital? Uh-huh. Well, that took you foolish gods long enough. What took you so long? Hurry or not we get yelled at anyway. What did you do with the stupid bottles? I didn't do anything. - That's the problem. - Why is that a problem? You bought a car? What happened to ascetic life and shunning worldly things? It's a matter of standards. We just have different standards. Come on, gentlemen We should be setting a plan. Hwadam is gone so we should ask someone else. Someone else, who? Right! No, no I won?t! I Don't even wanna look at him. One visits the temple to meet Buddha not the temple monks. That bastard is no Buddha. He murdered his own master! Don't even think about bringing that up. Or the fact that we haven?t found Hwadam yet. Catch the goblins! Then well set you free! Buy him a drink scratch him where it itches. Set him free? - Were gonna seal him back in. - Sure. How can we lie? We are holy beings. We should keep our word. Give him a noble title. Noble title, my ass Come on. Did you bring your Bible? No, of course not Let's try again. And again. Are you all right? Woochi good sir! You must be disoriented after five centuries of sleep but can you recognize us? Water. A drink. Give him a drink! Sir, the goblins have returned Thus the heavens ordered free the wizard Woochi and he will capture them! Then You'll be set free and attain great fame. Why should I? Why? Well, Woochi the scound... Woochi the wizard is mighty and great. The peoples hero! Beloved by all. Unmatched in power... - Knows style and elegance? - What? Yes, of course! Knows style, elegance is courageous and brave. The very standard of righteousness! So why not catch some goblins and enjoy this world once more? - I Don't feel like it. - Don't feel like it? Why would I go through all that trouble when I'm already free? Why Don't you? We can defeat goblins! No doubt about it! You can? Then why must I capture them? Yes. Why must he? Because well give you a title. Yes! A noble title! A title? High Wizard. Of the Royal Wizard Priory. Wow! Royal Wizard Priory? But I've yet to find the bronze knife. Could I still be worthy of such a title? More than worthy! So, shall we, Master? Where is Hwadam? He passed away ages ago. Someone is coming. Is there a back door? What for? We must first run. Will you not fight? No talismans. Start the car! - I knew it! - Here is the door! He's here! What is this? There are no shackles. If you believe so it becomes so. You cannot see it but you cannot escape it. - What is this? - It is like a steed. That's more confusing. Just push him. Where are the talismans? - With Chorangyi. - Chorangyi? Grab him. - What? - Get in. Where is it? With Chorangyi! - Who?s Chorangyi? - The mutt! Chorangyis painting. - Chorangyis painting? - Yes! - I threw it away when I moved. - What? Yeah, it's me Remember those paintings I gave you? No, not the pretty one The one with the man and the dog. - You sold it? - I sold it. I'll stay on the line. Hurry and look for it. How this land has changed! But humans never change. Death can come knocking at any moment but just look at them! They waste their lives chasing after desire when one must seek spiritual enlightenment. Namas Avalokite? Vara Bodhisattva... What do men do now to win a lady?s heart? Going down on one knee is a sure thing. Go down? Sure. - Women like James Bond. - James Bond? Romance? Says who? That's all lies. You still believe those lies women tell you? They want diamonds and the works under their little chins. Come on. Eyes ahead! - I found it. - Found it? 109 Dapsip district? Found it? - But it's closed. - What now? Break in! What is wrong with those maidens? They are announcing the opening of a new venue. Ah, a brothel? A tavern that sells pigs meat, sir The king of this land is crazy as well. There is no king now. It's the truth. Many terrible things happened throughout history and... Turn right! Eyes ahead! What the hell?! Open your eyes! It's okay. We can't die! What about Woochi? - Are you okay, sir? - Shh. I'm emptying my soul. Hey, it worked! No talismans! - Okay, sir. - Watch out ahead! Sir Woochi! Sir Woochi! - Faster, faster! - Okay, okay. - No, slow down - Slow down. Speed up! Slow down! This was such a bad idea! Give me your hand! - Is he in? - He's in! - Behind us! - Where?! Hit the gas! Ahead! The bus! - Third lane! - Okay! - Turn right! - Let me signal first. Just turn right! It worked! Hit the brakes! Building 109. Let's go, sir Building 109. - Building 109. - This way? Over there! Were coming, Chorangyi - It's here. - We found it! Where?s Woochi? He was here. Go get him. Well go find Chorangyi. Master! Master? Master! Run for it! Found it. You found it? Found it! Let's chant. Were short one. Yes? - Were going to chant on the phone. - Now? I think I broke my back! That's okay. Double-time! Start! Darn this smoke! - Chorangyi. - Where are the talismans? Woochi! Long time no see. Here are your talismans! I need to pee. - Chorangyi! - But I need to pee. All right. Nice tune. Time for me to change! - Woah, Woochi! - Go get them! You're doing great, Master! Be careful, Master! Sir Woochi! Are you okay? - Should I help? - I can handle it. Now I'm really going to change. It's about time! What's with this one? No, turn Turn around. Behind you. That's it. - Turn around. - Turn around, idiot - Go with them. - Go! Which one's the real Woochi? Looks like I have to step in as always. Let's have some fun shall we? There you go! It'll snap, you wench! Where?s a log? Wait! - Shoo! Duck! It's okay. Good. Let's put away the goblins. Woochi and Chorangyi, too - Master Woochi! - Superb! Marvelous! Go seal in the goblins. We did it! We? I did it. There you go again. I snapped that wenchs wrist. - Didn't you hear it? - Master! - The goblin is not here! - Uh? It's gone. Just as I thought, mutt. Hey! Where are you going? Woochi! What was that? - Did you hit someone?! - Yea... No. No. We need Woochi! What is this psycho wearing at this time of night? You're right. He's crazy. He's dead, right? Don't open the door. You shouldn't go out in these situations. - He's getting up! - Oh my god! - Give me your card. - Send him to the hospital. You're okay, right? Get yourself treated first and then call this number. Your eyes... Sir? They still carry the ocean. Are you drunk? Woochi! And now what? Go to the hospital. It's her! Covering up is useless Yes, I'm the famous actress What the?! Don't come into the car. I'll give you an autograph. Master you mustn?t harass the people. - That's right, step off - I'm sorry. I'll close... - Wait, the actress? - Yes, it's me Step on it! The widow! Hey, look at me What ocean? All I see is my face. He was just being nice probably. Crazy bastard. Hand me my hat. Sure. I Don't want to shoot today. What a strange world. Hey. Why would Hwadam kill Master? He must be planning something. - Could he be here too? - He's gone. That is why they summoned me. Look who's gotten smarter. I can't help what comes naturally. Hold on. Green blood! Smell's good. Why is someone lying here on the ground? He needs help. Master, not now Believe in the Lord. This way, Master Who feeds the people if there is no king? - No king? - Corporate... Modern-day merchants. They built all these tall buildings. Don't jest with me. Merchants are corrupt fiends by nature. Yet you say they are feeding the people? Such a land is destined for grief and ruin. Is this booze as well? That is why an exalted man came to save us from our sins. Am I that exalted man? No, he is Jesus Christ He protects us with a power unimaginable and unmatched. Then why did you not ask this Jesus instead of me? He must have been busy. This is the blood of Christ. The quite tasty blood. This is someone?s blood? Very nice and tasty. That's perfume, Master! - Is it delicious? This way, sir The green blood is that way. - Sad that I was... - I want some! How happy I now am! - I want some! - This way. - What is that? That is also a steed of sorts. What is this place? It's where lives are wasted, sir I highly approve of this. What the hell? Come on Come on, let's go. Rest in peace. You did the right thing. I think I found a way to see her again. ? I didn't ask you for food I didn't ask you for clothes. ? only offered you a harmless little drink. ? Looks can deceive ? so Don't give me that look. - What is this... - Blast it! Traitor! It was all for the country. For the country... Selling your country is for the country?s good? You said you'd leave on the next train. - I lost my ticket. - I lost my ticket. And now you've lost me. And now youth lust me. You said you loved me. Was it all a lie? They were only sweet nothings. Farewell, my love What are you doing? Shoot me! Bye-bye, my love! Cut! It's freezing! - Misfired! No good, right? - That was great! I smell an Oscar! Aren't there any shots for lisps? Everything was off. But the walking is the worst. I know. These shoes... Don't fit. I'm gonna get so many blisters! - Bring me the other shoes. - Right away! You have to sing like Audrey - and run like Marilyn. - And when I shoot? Shoot like... How hard could this be? And what's this? My shoes! Right away! - Shoes! - I'm coming! Shoot like Angelina Jolie. Then how about paying me like them? It's nothing against you, though These shoes are wasting everyone?s time. They came out a bit small. Get bigger ones instead of forcing me into their standards! What is she doing? Look! She can't even tell between left and right! Silly me. Don't lean on it! Seems like the shackles are gone, eh? What is this? Wherever you go we can always summon you back. Get the art director! What are you doing? I saw someone there, and they went splat! These are too small. They Don't fit? Go get these in one size bigger. Okay. You're Korean, for heaven?s sake! Quickly! Koreans go quickly, quickly. I got it. You'll never get them off. You will undo these shackles once I catch you your goblins? Of course! Where'd you learn to dance like that? In the mountains! You wanna get together sometime? How? That Woochi should've done a better job. How did things go? Did they catch it? Yeah, they got it Tell him to be careful with the bottle. That nincompoop probably gave him trouble. And tell him we need The Pipe! Master, we need that pipe - How tiring this is! - This is a picture, too? You shouldn't! Master?! Wait. I think it's this way. How would you know? It's just instinct. Oh, that's reassuring It's this way. And how do you know? I spent over a century just telling fortunes. It's got an eerie vibe like that underground prison. Why are you bringing that up again? No! What a believable performance! Sneaking off set and taking a nap. Look! Look at how You're stressing out my skin and making it sag! Yeah, it is What? No, I meant You're still gorgeous. Just go get me coffee, black and strong. Sure. One cup of strong coffee. Great job, sir It's hardly a job. I'll find it for you. There it is! It's your picture, see? She's obsessed with you. Woah... That's mine. She basically flirts with anything that moves. I heard you asked the director if you could audition, too! I was just being polite. Being polite? Just how far will you go to be polite? Here?s your coffee. I'm set. You drink that. Okay. What's that? Great picture. It looks like some resort. I'm gonna go there someday. In-kyung. Why Don't we go someday just the two of us? - You like that? - Sure... Could we get a comment, sir? We hope this investigation will clear some suspicions regarding bribery in congress and art collections of major corporations. We heard the verdict was already bought. That is false. Are you sure this isn't another wild-goose chase? I assure you, it is not. Did you see that? I saw it. The bronze knife of all the places! - Should we head over? - Of course. How'd it get from the dukes mansion to there? Hey! How'd you get in here? I've only come for the bronze knife. You're brothers? Who's older? He's got a finer coat. Don't mind us and go play with your brother. Why are those ropes around their necks? He's got spunk, eh? It's your lucky day. Why can't he see it right in front of him? Beats me. Please provide identification. This nobleman is known as Woochi. Please provide identification. Isn't that enough? Should I tell her your hometown? It's all right. A highly-renowned wizard of Pyongyang Master. Student of the East Priory Master and soon-to-be High Wizard. The nobleman who speaks before you is I, Woochi Please provide identification. That's enough, damn wench! Step aside. Relentless hag! Show yourself evil wench! Let me smell for some bronze. I knew I smelled apples. Very nice picture. This time we'll catch him and lock him up for seven centuries. Humans will be gone after seven centuries. Wanna hear something funny? I saw a doctor last week. Know what he said? Told me to quit smoking. I'm dying of cancer. Me, with cancer! I'm dying! What an idiot. Hey, blood! He looks familiar. Summon Woochi. Yeah. The phone! Get the phone, man! Why's it so loud there? Summon Woochi! Summon him! Master Woochi! Found it. I found it! Now we have it all. Start chanting! You hear me? Chant! Okay Summon me, too Why can't it even cut through this? Start! You sure that's the great bronze knife? Perhaps it got rusty. What the heck is this?! Chorangyi! What are you doing down there? Bring us up! What's going on? Woochi doesn't know how to swim. Then what's he doing in there? Did you catch it? Woochi! Are you okay, Master? Of course. Well done, sir You even swim better, too - Woochi Good job. - Good job. Sir Woochi please wait for a moment. We will prepare a great present for you. Let's put this one away first. Get the gourd bottle. They're walking away. Like it's any use. Let's put it away. How did we get here? - I Don't see shackles! - Believe it, then it is there Then why believe it? We can just not believe. But how?! Gosh, I can't cut off my paw We can use the talismans! All right. This time, Woochi - Chorangyi. - Huh? Put your foot up. - Let's not. - Why not? A promise is a promise. The guilt will pass sooner than you think. Be gentle. It worked. What is this? How did he get them off? It's all finally over. Over? We have to lock him up. With what powers? Father! Could you hear my confession right now? I'm a bit busy. If it's a small sin you could come back later. It's a large sin. Surely it can't be that large... You can confess anything for our Heavenly Father forgives all. He must be exhausted. Yes, I'm sure he is Is there really a dead cat on my back? Who told you such a thing? Just someone some time ago... Could you take a look? Goodness. There are two. Everyone carries their past sins with them. The beauty of life is that good deeds can erase... Hold on, my child Please step outside. Wait! Over there! - What's wrong? - The gourd bottle! - What? - They're rattling! What happens? Look! How did they get out?! Master Hwadam! Crafty creatures they may be but surely they are no match for I. How have you been? - Long time, gentlemen - As powerful as ever, sir Now that You're back no more Woochi... You summoned back that fool? He kept insisting on it. Did I chant alone? Who didn't guard the bottles? Why do you suppose the bottles broke? So as Master Hwadam just said if the goblins came knowing we would summon Woochi then Woochi might be controlling the goblins. How? He has half of The Pipe. That's right. I always knew I couldn't trust him. Woochi caught the goblins! It was I who caught these goblins. That's true. And I, who will take back the half he stole from me. Once you do so please guard The Pipe as we had planned long ago. But you Don't know where Woochi is. That's it. Yes! Almost done. Last shot! Done? Change into this next. - Where is it now? - Thailand. The pose! Right, the pose Number one. Number two. Number three. Can't do three. - Two looks easiest. - Okay. Gosh, that's freaky Oh my god! - Did you hear something? - Nope. Who are those? Excuse me! This is private... Sang-ho, help me Don't touch those! Please, get out! Come on! - Get out! - Okay, okay Goodness! You look thinner than before. Who are you? It's me, Chorangyi! You remember you rode on my back before. I did? I even licked your hand like this! Why would I? Because I was a horse back then. - Horse? - But I'm really a dog. - Dog? - And now I'll be human. Because Woochi is now the greatest wizard in the world! All these years and you haven?t aged a bit! Wow! Fancy seeing you here! Who are you? Hit by a car and a wall but You're perfectly fine. And why do you keep following me? Because I made a promise to keep you safe. For the nobleman before you - is the wizard, Woo... - A promise to whom? To you. You must have the wrong person. No, it is you So what do you want from me? I want to give you the works. To wear under that chin of yours. Are you on something? So then do wizards tell fortunes, too? Someone said I?d be a sturdy tugboat in a storm. You Don't like to read. Uh-huh. Or sewing. That's right. That was really hard for me being a stylist and all. You are a wizard. I am not the kind You're thinking of. Then what kind are you? What kind of wizard... Huh? I am this kind of wizard. But how did you... Oh my! Just my luck. Yes? In front of your poster? I've been kidnapped! Aren't you in the dressing room? It's that guy from the accident. Hold on. Call waiting. Why didn't you get the phone? Where am I? Kids, where is this? Never mind. I'll ask someone else! I'm not that actress! Please, go away! Give us an autograph! My brothers a cop! Don't follow me! Did you do something to her? Yes. Why? - Because... - In-kyung, she's been kidnapped! Jesus, she's really gone - Let's go, In-kyung! - I'm coming. We?ll talk later. Hey, let's go What?d she say? At? - At Yahoo, dot... - Dot? - Com? - Com? Crazy humans. Here, I'll give you one last ride before I turn human. - Last? - Yes. Last what? Last ride before I'm human. You're a great wizard now with the mirror and knife and all. So then isn't it time for me to become human? These are just symbolic, really Symbolic of a great wizard. Symbolic? I'm through with you! I'll lose my manhood following a liar like you! I'll just go ask Hwadam to change me. Where is Hwadam? Now you listen to what I say? You saw Hwadam? Sure did. Where? At the warehouse while looking for the bronze knife. Just his emblem. Looks like this. Where are you going? To find Hwadam. How old are you? Eleven years old. A longer life will still end in emptiness, my child The guy that issued the warrant is an old classmate of mine. He knows there's nothing at home but it's just for formality. But thanks for warning me anyway. But I moved out of that office months ago. All right. Thanks. To the old office, sir? Yeah. Step on it. Never have I seen a man chosen by the people truly help the people. How'd you get in here? You from some citizen's group? Do you know the one who uses this emblem? Do you know who I am? A third-term congressman! I will ask you again. Where is he? Somewhere out there, I guess Out there, where? If you truly desire it he will come to you someday. I should skin you alive and teach you a lesson but I will grant mercy for I am too busy. - You there! - Me? You noticed! I was just in the neighborhood. What a doggone life. Jack! The gas is out again! Gas? Fire! You can do this. That thing's broken. Oh, it's broken? No wonder. That's why this didn't work. Where are you scurrying off to? Just getting some fresh air. Long time no see, sir! Do you fear death? Not so much death but the process, I guess We do go centuries back. We do! Remember the old days? You throwing me in the water... And Koreans value those ties that bind! With that tablet you can become human, or Human? Or? Or your insides can burn to ashes with a snap of my fingers. How many talismans does Woochi have left? Why? You Don't want me to bring... But without them, he's Don't you want to be human? - Human? - Yes. A human... I Don't know! You remember the freak? He dragged me all the way out there. But I can't really explain how I got there. Why are you staring at me? Huh? You Don't believe me? Yes, I believe you. No, no You Don't believe me. All of you Don't! I'm telling Honeybuns! - Did you draw the bath? - I did. Fine, then go - Should I go, too? - Stay until he comes. Honeypoo, it's me Meow. Meow. Meow... Bring me Woochi. Why should I? For I shall have The Pipe and set you all free. Why can't I work with a sane director for once? He acts like he's gonna go to Cannes! Hold on, baby I'll call you back. Ki-chul turn that down! Come on. Ki-chul! Ki-chul? Ki-chul? Stop joking around. You're scaring me. Attacked, my ass! Probably slipped in the tub. You saw how she walks! It was bound to break sometime. Don't even go there. That role isn't just for anyone! She has to look good. Look poised. Move with grace and elegance and have this bursting passion. And fire in her eyes... I gotta go. I didn't notice your eyes before. There's something there. The ocean? The ocean? Sure! The ocean! You should audition for me. They were just sweet nothings. - Like that? - There you go. Let's get a drink somewhere. I'll go get the check. Where'd she go? Woochi! Woochi!? We caught two goblins, right? Right. You and me together. But there's still another one. Where? - Nearby. - Near here? That goblin will surely lead me to Hwadam. Why were you calling for me? I thought we were through. Of course not! Woochi give me a hug. Master used to say that all bonds are pain. Quiet! Be careful. You too! Hey! Get out of the goddamn road! Is that all of it? That's everything. Might be one or two more. Betraying your best friend. You are turning human. So I'm becoming human now, right? How can a dog turn into a human with a mere tablet? Why do you keep following me? Anything different in what you see? Where is Hwadam? That's all you have to say? Beauty often shrouds the poison within. What kind of beauty, exactly? Tell me in detail. Pure eyes holding the ocean within. The silhouette of the nose is like the majestic mountains. Wonder why you left out my lips? What are you saying? That's why I betrayed my friend! That's why I'm standing here! You are here to watch your beloved friend die. Die? No, he can't! Woochi! Don't come closer, Woochi! What are you doing here? Hwadam is... How long I have waited... Your arrogance has finally brought you here. I can't help knowing my talent. Even without your precious talismans? What should I do? Woochi! Watch out! What a beautiful night to die. Why must I keep away from her? She will lead you to your grave. Lead me to my grave... Afraid of death? You still have one left! I'll help you! Woochi! Blast him away with it! One silly talisman is useless Is this my grave? The last talisman. Idiot! Could this be a dream? Life is but a dream. The nobleman before you is Woochi, the wizard Blind at the face of death. We almost lost this to that scoundrel. It will only take a moment. The Pipe in one piece after five centuries. Chorangyi, you mutt! You little mongrel! Look at his fan! Hwadam killed our master, you idiots! There is no way Master Hwadam would... Of course not. I've got one last talisman I tucked away. I, Chorangyi, would rather die an honorable dog than live as a filthy human! Fire! What am I doing? Why am I drawing what is already in my soul? Are you okay?! I think it's time for me to change! Woochi's got The Pipe! My soul isn't completely empty yet. Where are we going? Your favorite place. Be careful! Hurry, the door's closing! Where is this? I'm stuck! Why now? Pull me out. Protect the lady. Okay, I will Don't worry. My neck! Who's this woman? - The widow. - Widow? From five centuries ago. Five centuries? Could she be? No, Sir Woochi! Don't come this way! Fire! Fire! Hey, me too! Pull! This is the proper way to summon the wind. One is not real. It's not real! You're a better match than your master. And you've got a better eye for talent. The best kind of guest is one who leaves. Master! Master Woochi! Woochi! Are you okay? Is that a goblin, too? That lady is... I Don't think so. What are you? Girlie, over here! The side. Peach blossoms? Crazy girl. Watch your tongue! Could it be Arch god? Look closely, sir This girl is the Arch god?! Who?s that? He doesn't remember us. To shun Taoist solitude and dream of Confucian success is just a waste of a dream. If you Don't know that you Don't know reality and then you Don't know what you know. You know? What in the world are you saying? Master. Master, are you all right? What's wrong with him? Even he must have a conscience, Master You fought Hwadam with me. What? - And even betrayed me. - He's still drunk. I send you on errands but you go to the palace and dare ridicule the king! - Start brawls with goblins! ...brawls with goblins... And even kidnap a widow... Fighting goblins and avenging my death in this dream... Even fighting Hwadam. Did these things empty your soul? They sure didn't, Master Is this real? I have scolded you with a dream to clear your clouded mind. - Master. - Take your tea. Then that woman... Send her back home. She is more than you can bear. Yes. Right... Here. Master. When you wrote Shoot the zither case... What are you saying? Take your tea. It'll get cold. Go ahead. What are you doing?! Master saw all the way to this very moment. Master! Are you all right? We will take care of that scoundrel. We had faith in you from the very beginning. Master. Foolish gods. I will go in myself. Woochi! I heard somewhere... that a true gentleman doesn't hold grudges. Fine. I will make you human. Really? But I'll teach you your real identity first. I'm just a stupid dog that's what. That's true, but... A female dog. Really? Yes. How... How can I be a girl?! Man and beast has always lived in peace. But that's what man thinks. After it was all over the biggest help came from the brave Chorangyi. That's me. Only the Taoist gods recognize my true value. Only the Taoist gods... How did the film turn out? Someone set fire to the set Haven't filmed for a month. It's that hard breaking into this business. I heard the lead actress was switched. You said you loved me. Was it all a lie? They were only sweet nothings. Farewell, my love! Cut! Okay! Good thing we switched the lead. I smell an Oscar! That was great. - Really? - Of course! - Hurry up and push! - Okay. - Hey, You're back? - Hi, Do-bin! - Is the director busy? - Yeah, but how's the leg? It's fantastic! I Don't know how you did it but an actor isn't made overnight! - How's your leg feeling? - It's fine. - What the... - Hey! - What? - Huh? You three were all in on this together! Go bring them inside. Yes, ma'am And you, go right now and tell them you quit. That stupid resort you love. Tell them You're going there. I have had enough of this. Who do you think you are speaking to? You already have new agents?! Are these the people? Yes, officer They're dangerous. She claims you kidnapped her a month ago, correct? - Exactly twenty-six days ago. - Yes. That's right. Could I get changed first? Sure. I'll help! I think we should bring them in Officer Kim, over here! Bring who where now? Avert those eyes! She's changing! Don't worry, Master We're standing right outside. Something's wrong. Open the curtains! - Is there a back door here? - No, sir Where'd they go? I know! Right there! Where's this? Nice sniffing you. I'm Chorangyi. Wait for me! I've always wanted to come here. With a guy. Why here? I'm not sure. It just drew me in. This music sounds familiar. Did I... see this moment ahead of time? Is this... the ocean?
