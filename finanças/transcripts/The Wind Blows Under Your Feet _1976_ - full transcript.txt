We can dug the canal here for take the water from the moors into the river. The town needs more plough-land. And the moors yield only outlaws. You're upsetting the ancient order. The people of the moorland will not tolerate it. This pasture is the town's. And herdsmen are guarding the town's cattle. The vagabonds and outlaws are your care, sir. There you make a mistake. Outlaws and herdsmen are all alike. This landless lot does not know what is waiting for them. Their service will expire on St. Andrew's day. By then the work have to be done. Sir Balázs Mérges will be responsible for the peace. He's the squire of our town, and for help him and for maintain order instead of the two police constable three man will be detailed. You can trust him, lads. He captured and brought in prison Gyurka Farkas Csapó the most famous rascal of seven countries. "Have you ever heard of the County Bihar?" "And the damned prison of Várad?" "Oh yes, I've heard it," "Even I suffered in it," "God damn the man," "who had this prison built." "My brothers, my friends," "how faithless you are!" "You never come to see me in my sad prison." "I'll get out I shall not die" "I'll duly pay your loyalty." THE WIND WHISTLES UNDER THEIR FEET STARRING: I didn't do it all for myself, Gyurka! Hell! Let's go by that way. No. We'll drive into them. Hey! Hey! Don't move if you value your life. Your purse! Do you recognize me, Ferkó Babák? I didn't betray you, Gyurka. It was the innkeeper Timók. "Decree" "In order to put down the disturbances and robberies which in the pastures" "of our town are assuming serious propositions" "the town council of Karcag hereby decrees the re-establishment of public order." "So that the canal-building and farming" "are not hampered in any way" "and the farmers" "and shepherds..." Rogue is the one who dug up the pasture. This will not be for good. This will be for evil. "...are warned off from committing..." Well! Well done, brother! That will make them understand. The outlaws wear large-brimmed hats to hide their face. Therefore no one is allowed to have hats with brims wider than 8 inches. And the brims of hats already made are to be cut off. They're carrying off water, the land is spreading, the pastures are diminishing. Town people are insatiable. That's why they gadded these homeless upon us. They are Calvinists. The bishop of Eger dashed them from his land. That's why they accept ungodly work. Gyurka Farkas Csapó wouldn't have suffered their digging up the moorland. He was the last one who could have taught lesson. And yet it was you who gave him up. No, it wasn't us! He was one of us. The squire himself caught him at the inn. You informed against him, you turd. I know it. You sold him for 50 forints. It wasn't me. It was Ferkó Babák. Is it your hat? This thing cools the wine. Now you'll drink your wine. And I'll drink from my flask. This poisoned wine causes a man to quickly lose his wits. And the fraudster innkeeper can easily cheat him. Are you still alive, András Timók. Of course I am, I'm in good health. That doesn't mean anything. Anyone who deserves it can die without illness. Stand up you rough, I'm talking to you. Don't move. All right, my boy, calm down. I see you have a bone to pick wit this snitcher. There are too many rascals nowadays. They'd even strip the dead of their shrouds. You're right. In this world it no longer pays to be an outlaw. If these things go on like this, I'll dismount for good. I'll brace myself up and say: A hack and a scythe for me! A hack and a scythe? You see, I'm looking for work. And if you don't dismount, I'll gladly take service with you. Why with me of all people? I've got neither horses nor cattle. The two of us would be the master here. A great many people expect us to settle things right here. Well, yes. In the past we could ride with the wind. There weren't any ditches to stop us. So, you're back, Gyurka. So, I am. And in good health, sir. And were you released or did you leave just like that? You'll hear about it, sir. Have you got a pass? I have it here. In my inside pocket. All right, Gyurka Farkas Csapó. I can see your papers are in order. Now tell me, do you bear me a grudge because of old times? No, I don't. You did your duty, sir. Now throw down your guns and be off. Take care, Gyurka! The great times are over. Isn't it a pity that the squire squanders the remnants of his riches like that? His domain is going to ruin. That's why he accepted such a difficult post. Hes a bit old for it. Listen, lad! The squire is getting old. And with him the land is getting old and so am I. I don't like the way you talk about old people. Now take this gun after him. Squire, sir! By gosh! Shouldn't we get him off the rope? Timók, the innkeeper will see to it. Well, he certainly won't. Because he's the one who's on it. By gosh! What the hell? He had no other chance. He knew he was doomed. Did Gyurka visited him last night? Yes, sir. Now he will no longer be of use to you, the faithless bastard. "The fog cores up the hill," "Soon it will be raining." "The County is chasing me" "They want to get hold of me" "Come, saddle for me, friend" "my lovely black horse." "I'll lift him to the river to its whirling waters." "We'll easily leap over the whirling river." "And at my sweetheart's house I'll get a good meal." "A gaudy silk shawl is spread out on her bed" "Many young shepherd boys have rested their heads on it." Gyurka! - Csapó Gyurka! Come out! - Oh, my God! So here we are. Don't kill each other, my dear angels! Kill me, instead! I'm glad you're back and in good health, Gyurka. But keep clear of the village They're waiting for you. I let my wife go. She's yours. And you should enrich my flock in your comings and goings. I've listened too many evil words, why shouldn't I listen the friendly ones? The Morgó inn in the moorland stands empty. An industrious landlady would be good there. This calls for a drink. And let's have some roast with the wine. "The herd are sadly mooing," "The master had the pasture ploughed." "The fields around me are all dead." "Why does the Lord suffer that?" You're clever at damaging ditches, aren't you? "The horse-herd's horse has run away" "Leaving his master behind." "What's worth a horse-herd without his horse?" "Just patters witlessly." Get out, you beggars! Did I hear a dog whining? Take that, you, bastard! Now you know who spoke to you. Music! Cheers! Play, damn you! Just to show you some mettle. What will we do now, sir? What the hell could we do, lad? We'll take a deep breath and go back. Squire, sir! If you come along with me, you can come back in peace. You're my guest for a glass of wine. - Your pass? - Here's my pass. As long as I'm here, you're safe. Peace in the moorland rests on honour. Has it ever occurred to you, Gyurka, what good does it do to you to be running about like that? To leading such a hard life? Sir, to be hanging on the gallows is hard as long as you don't get used to it. A beautiful horse. His fame is all over the county. Can you guess what I'm thinking off? You're thinking that two make a pair. And that someone who gets about a lot, and can see a lots of horses, could pick the very best one. But I'm thinking of something else, too. That I know the man in question. If this old horse-thief is willing, I may shut my eyes to it... What's the matter? Nothing, sir. Gyurka Farkas Csapó has sent you a black horse. That's what I brought. Stop yelling under my window, you fool. Take that hag to the stable. The gendarme and the coachman are there. I'll be coming as well, but by the time I get there you clear out or I'll have you skinned alive. Who's there? I've brought a colt for the squire. I'll tie him up. I'm in a hurry. If you leave the strange horse there, ours will start a kicking row. Take him out! Wait outside, I'll coming. A rascal guards the gendarme's honour. Halt! Come on! Good day. Good day. Keep please these horses. Not for long, just till the big fair of Kecskemét. How many have you got there? You know, I didn't count them. But when we were driving them, our whips did not touch. All right, you'll get back just as many. Loyalty is a fairer measure than yards. Measures are only for crooks. What's that, my lad? My share. One colt is your share. We got the lot together. I've right to the half of it. I'm glad you don't want the lot. Take care, my boy. Stop there! Very well. We are unable to work like this. They stole our animals. You promised 10 yokes of oxen and we didn't get any. It isn't mentioned in your contract. The Vienna traders are due here before long. Our fatted animals are for them. This kind of work will makes them grow thinner. We have to drag the carts ourselves. Get down to work one way or another. St. Andrew's day is getting close. If you aren't ready by then, you wont get your money. We'll never be ready, sir, if instead of working we have to protect our lives. This is the squire's business. I warned you, didn't I? And you knew what to expect. You stirred up the moorland and now here's the result. Instead of lecturing to us, sir, go find the horse-thieves. They are more straight than many honest people. It's rumoured that you often visit the Morgó inn. That you fraternize with the rascals. Isn't this your mare, Bedo Imre? Yes. And she's put on your cloak. Come on, Manci! Aren't you afraid these poor wretches will prick holes in your hide? I'm not. Because I'm looking for a work. I should gladly enter your service, sir. That's not so easy. But if you inform me about a crime I'm not aware of, you may have chance. If I don't come to harm I'll tell you who's the main trouble-maker in the moorland. You'll come to harm if you don't clear out at once. I'll clear out. Do you know that Gyurka Farkas Csapó is at large? Go away, bastard! A traitor to his friends will never be a gendarme. I'll be no gendarme. I'll rather be a squire. Do you want anything else, squire? It's you I want most of all. If only your husband weren't here. My husband isn't a dangerous man. But Gyurka Farkas Csapó is. You needn't be afraid of him, sir. They say the two of you are like old good friends. I caught the rogue here. But now it won't be easy to catch him. Because shepherds and rascals are the same. They protect one another like brothers. There's only one way to find him. Set a prize on his head. Sir! I lifted a couple of horses from Kákapuszta. What? - I don't understand. - Of course you do. Who's that gallows-bird? Damn! To horse, you rotters! "The Town Council have decided" "to rebuke the squire Balázs Mérges," "for his having fail Gyurka Farkas Csapó, the notorious robber," "thus leaving him free to commit" "ungodly deeds." "This outlaw has the theft of innumerable beands of cattle on his conscience," "attacks of the farmers labouring in the moorland," "armed robberies, riots and many other crimes." We cannot abide that chap. I hope you can't either. He didn't escape from me. We have started something new in this county. There's no room old-fashioned brigands like him. This is called progress. And you've got to get used to it. I know that grain fetches higher prices than cattle. We've lost our patience, sir. Your duty is to catch the brigands. Are you capable of arresting him or do you need help? I'll bring him in. But not to you. "Wanted." "Dead or alive the notorious robber, Gyurka Farkos Csapó," "outlaw and murderer." "The particular assembly of Karcag town" "held on November 26, 1837," "confirmed its earlier promise of prize on his head." "Moreover notice, is hereby given," "that for the capture of Gyurka Farkas Csapó " "we will pay 100 forints, for his executors 50, and for his dead body 25." "From the cash of the town." Look, my dear how nicely our flock is shaping. - Bring me a mirror quickly! - For what, my dear? To have a look at this head worth of 100 pieces of gold. Oh, come! Who would dare to tempt the providence? Even if he's in ambush, he'll have 50 pieces of gold for my dead body. 50 pieces of gold? That's nothing. There's more to be got out of those diggers. They have no money, these ones. It will be St. Andrew's day soon. The Town Council will pay them in gold. All right. This will chase them from our land for good. I'll get in front of them. And you, lad, come up from behind. When I give the signal, we'll rush at them. "The weather is sad, it's about to change." "My heart is sad, it's about to break." "It's easy for you darling in the bed" "But it's hard out here all by myself." Stop that cart! Your lives are in my hand. I don't want to take anybody's life. But you're dead if you move. That man should come here. Throw down your cloak! And now the purse. We have no money, sir. Stop! Pick up your money and good bye. Where's he? I'm neither a gendarme, nor a king. I'm looking for a dirty cad, you know who I mean. Don't you know anything about him? I don't. He hasn't been here lately. Do you know, Gyurka, that the lieutenant comes against you with 22 gendarmes? Let them, if they know where to find me. Gyurka Farkas Csapó! Surrender! There's no way out for you. You're surrounded. Gyurka, look out! The district lieutenant is coming to capture you with 22 of his men, Gyurka. No way out. Be sensible and surrender to me. Don't shoot, sir. It's me, Parti Bözsi. Come out then! Gyurka isn't here. I haven't seen him for a long time. Go on! What are you waiting for? He isn't up there. A miracle has happened. All right. Then I'll go myself. Good morning, sir. What do you want to do with these poor wretches? A man was murdered. We are looking for the murderer. Are you interfering in my affairs. I received an order. The mayor turned to the district for help. He said you are not able to do with horse-thieves. But what do you want with these people? Everybody knows that Gyurka Farkas Csapó killed that lad. Te Mayor says that the witnesses didn't recognize the murderer. A thorough inquiry is needed. But Gyurka did it. Gyurka Farkas Csapó was not seen there lately. Every shepherds are suspects. The rascals find shelter among them. You there! Come here! Molnár! Do you see, sir? This is how the rascal can be distinguished from the shepherds. We must have peace in the county at last. Lieutenant, let's go forward! Are you coming along, sir? No. I've got some business to see to. Get going! Well, good bye. Get going! He's in here. Surrender, Gyurka! Can't you see they arrested all those people because of you? Sir! He's up there. He's heading for the canal. Uncle Mihály! Where are you? Don't move! Get down! Back, you rascals! Back! Out of the way! Come on! What do these people want? Are they to claim something? Send them off, sir! They have no business to do here. Follow me! Back! Get going! Get a move on! You too! Don't you understand, lad? "Sentence passed by the summary court." "Gyurka Farkas Csapó, horse-herd, aged 38 years and 3 months," "born at Karcag, bachelor," "guilty of robbery, pillaging and murder" "has been sentenced as a deserved punishment and as a warning to others" "to be hanged by the neck till his dead." I say, sir, you would have picked a better trade. "I'm a poor man, but like a gentleman." "My dirty collar eats away at my neck." "God Almighty, where will death come to me?" "In the woods or in the fields, or in the plain?" "Out there in the moorland I may be caught." "Out there in the fields I may be shot." "If I go into the woods, wild beasts will eat me," "And the birds of the sky will sing a dirge for me." WRITTEN BY: DIRECTED BY: DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY: MUSIC BY: STARRING:
