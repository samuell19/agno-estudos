Have you ever read the story about the dead dog who came back to life a couple of days after the dog was buried? He dug himself outta the grave. It was in all the papers. It takes several days for a corpse to really be dead. For example after we die our hair still grows, fingernails still grow, pimples still form and bowels still move. Energy pulsates throughout the body even after death. And this energy can be used to reverse the dying process. Whether it's a fluke electrical current in the brain or a lightning storm, the dead can come back to life. No one has ever figured out how or why, but it happens. If you don't believe me, go to the cemetery, walk up, lie on a fresh grave, put your ear to the ground and listen. Listen carefully to the sounds of a living dead clawing, scratching, digging, trying to escape before they suffocate and die again. I believe the suspended anatomical state of the deceased merits further investigation. Can electrical currents modulate cells between life and death? Can the life force be harnessed to in effect raise the dead? - Mr. Stockton, how much longer does this have to continue? - Frank and weenie. Kid's got a bolt loose, man. - Yeah. Justice. Okay, just settle down. Frank, continue if you must. - I intend to confirm the theory of heavy electron resurrection using live experimentation, on mice of course. - Why don't you know Frank, that theory was disproven as far back as the 18th century? Any hypothesis that deals with reanimation is purely fantasy. - Sir, I've already started my research. - Frank, I don't want to have to fail you again. - That was really embarrassing for me. You know, your stock depreciates every time you babble on like that. Geez Louise man, you need to get yourself together. - Hey Macy. - Oh, get over it, man. I don't know what's more ridiculous, you dating Macy or raising the dead. - Hey. - Hey. - I'm like invisible to her. - Listen, you know why I never get turned down? - Cause your hand can't talk? - That's very clever, that's clever. - Obvious product of dysfunctional family life. - Ugh, whatever, go on. - Looks like too much time in front of the set microwave if you ask me. - Macy! Look at Darian. She's so...big. - Sweet little honeys all primed for Lance's party tonight. - Let me think. Football team, cheap booze, raging hormones, yeah, what more could a girl want in an evening? You know what? Maybe we should go to his house. - Hey buddy. Did you hear I'm having a party tonight at 586 Rancho Riviera. - Okay, thanks. - For what? You're not invited. Man disected! - Dude, this sounds really gruesome. - Oh no, it's awesome. See, they froze this dead dude sub zero then sliced him with a laser into 50 sheets, and scanned him into the computer. - Oh, female compadres. Any new entries? Witch doctors from Peru? - No, no, no, he's a shaman. He's got a hell of a website on post-mortem resurrection rituals. - Frank, correspondence with these freaks cannot be healthy, even if they are only on the internet. - No, it's all part of my research. - You're too much man. You're way too obsessed with death. - No, no, it's life that interests me. Hey, speaking of, it's time to live a little. - Oh hey, where we going? - There's a party down the block at Lance Gipples. - So? - Well Macy will be there. - That's right. It's not death you're obsessed with, it's torture. Skeeter Wayne Dobbs, convicted felon and recent parolee, was shot dead this evening by the owner of a catering truck he was attempting to rob. Authorities say his brain has been donated to a medical facility researching the criminal mind. - Oh, good. I can't get any TV reception. You got any ideas? - Nope, I gotta go. - Tom, Hi Jordy, your science teacher, called again and I'm gonna have to tell your father this time. - If I can ever see him again. - Frank, if your father heard you say that, it would break his heart. You know your father's studying for his board review. You should be proud of him. - I'm sorry. - Not every kid's father studies brains for a living, right? - Mom, I won't be home late. - Yeah, you'd better get going. - Great. - Bye, sweetie. - Oh, Jordy. Oh , Mrs. Stein. - Nice to see you. - Frank! - Bye. I'm telling you Frank, it's a bad idea. - No, it's gonna be good, it's gonna be good. - What's up man? Pinch me, come on, pinch me! Right here, come on. I said pinch me. Ow! Just as I suspected. You're the one dreaming. - Right. Alright, I'll see you tomorrow party animal. - I love you, I love you. I love you. Do you think my breasts are small? - I love you. - No baby, it's not the size, it's what you do with them. - What can I do with them? - You cam let me touch them. - Can we go? Now? - Oh man, I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. - Excuse me ladies, this is boy talk. What are you doing in Mr. Lance's neighborhood, man? - Can I have a beer or some codeine or something? I don't want to see this. Come on. - Would you check this man out. You know, my shrink tells me that I get threatened by things that I don't understand. You know what I'm saying? And guess what? I don't understand you. - Oh yeah, that's what I'm talking about baby. - Just got cornbagged baby. - Oh Jesus. You drained all the water in the pool, dude. Give me the hose, I'll hose it down. - What's going on? - Tuttle hurled. - I'm warning you, it's chunky. - Where's Carl? - Oh, dude took off, he's gone. - Well if you're going to ignore us and spend all night barfing with each other, we're leaving too. - Okay, bye. - Bye. - Size does matter. - Egore! Egore, Egore? I did it. Into his car, I got it. I got him, I got him. - Oh man, where are we gonna take him? - Away from the house. - Oh man, we're gonna get caught. - I don't know. - We're gonna get caught, man. - It's a freak, chill, chill. Calm. - Hey. - Shouldn't you be inside minding your guests? - Guests? - Please, don't insult my intelligence, and I won't insult yours. - Oh, the thing! We got it handled. - What's with your friend? - Oh, he always looks like that, it's genetics. - The other one. - Oh, he's not our friend, man. We don't know him real well at all. - Doing the right thing. - Excuse me? - Designated driver. Better home in bed than dead. - Yeah, right. - Oh, right, yeah. - What's his name? - Karl. Karl. Doesn't Karl know Halloween's next week? - Oh, I guess. - You two are responsible for him. Don't do anything stupid. - Did that just, did he just... - As soon as Karl is reported missing, that cop is coming right back to us. - Missing, the dude is dead! - Really? - I can help. - Help? Who said anything about needing help? - Did we say we needed help? - I think I can bring him back to life. - What? - I mean, I think I can bring him back to life. - I thought that wrap of yours was some slick ass hustle to score up with fat chicks. - It's for real. It works on mice anyway. What have you got to lose? This is not gonna be easy. - Alright, well whatever it takes. - He's gonna need a new brain. - No way. - Come on, Tutts, in the interest of science, kid. - So why don't you like donate yours, dude? - I use mine occasionally. - I can get a brain from my dad's lab. - Well how convenient. Focus, be the ball, call the shot. - Go, go, run, run, run. - Lean and mean. Oh, dad's ID. - Okay, I need some light, guys. I can't see what I'm doing. - We're going stealth. - You're dealing with pros here, dude. - Okay, we need to put the TV antenna up on the roof. - Dude, the school's got cable. - No, no, the thing I brought in. - Oh right, the lightning rod. - And on your way back, stop off at the theater department and get some clothes, guy's looking crispy. - Tuttle. - It's go time. Alright, what's next? - I need a computer. - Copy. - Justice. - Sorry. - Computer locked and loaded. Next. - Reach outside and grab the extension cord. - Okay, alright. - I hate when that happens. We need more line, dude. - What do you want me to do about it? - I don't know, stretch it, pull it, whatever it takes to make it longer. Don't act like you don't do it every night, dude. And bridge. - Alright, so what now fellas? - We're gonna chop his lid off. - Bring me a new brain. - This end has to go on his foot. - What? - Do it. - You have to take off his sock, it has to be clipped on his raw skin. - He's got a toe ring, he deserved to die. - This other end to your ear. - Why do I always gotta be the guinea pig? - No, no, do your left ear, man. - Let's boogie. - Now's the time, now's the time. - Mommy. Good buzz. - Flat line. - What's going on? - Nothing. - He's not moving. - You're mulch, prick weed. Get him off of me! - We did it. We did it, man. He's alive. - He doesn't look alive to me. - What are you talking about? He just tried to french kiss you. - Piya, Pie. - Pie. - I stink. - He really does. - No it's okay. The living tissue will grow and replace the dead cells and the smell will go away. - Where am I? - Alright, you're Karl O'Reily. You're a junior in high school and you and Frank and Tuttle and the Lance, we broke into the school to steal some test papers and you hit your head man. - Yeah, it must hurt, huh? Well, it'll go away in time, I promise. - Thanks, Frank. - He looks like crap. - Yeah you're right. We have to get rid of this bloody hair. Bring in the clothes from the theater department. - This is your house, bro. It's the address we had for you on your license. - So, see you in school. Just put it in the old pocket there and head on home, okay? - Thanks for the lift, fellas. - Tuttle. - Frank, Frank, you hear the science lab got trashed last night? - Really? - I thought you might know. Your mom said you were grounded 'cause you were out all night. Social confrontation. - Well Frank Diddy, what's up baby? You know how it is. - Disappear. - Frank. That's not right, man. - We gotta get you to a File-a-Fax, kid. Names, numbers, addresses, you hear that? That's me. Show time. - Oh my God. What happened to Karl? - What are you talking about? - What'd you guys do to him? - Why? Nothing. - Well remember, weren't you gonna like beat him up or something? - Look, we swear on the Holy Bible, we didn't even... - Leather pants, so Jim Morrison. But I love you more. - He is pretty sexy. - I forgot the combo. - Ladies, meet our new pal, Frankie. - Whatever. - Something shoot through one of the kitchen cabinets? I thought your mouse died? - No, I bought a new one. He should be in his cage. - You need to talk to Frank. - What am I gonna say to him? - Well, he's your son and he's acting strange. - He's a teenager, that's what they do. - Egore, Egore. - You've got to think of him as a dangerous little chemistry experiment. - Egore. - They're just hormones, son, don't let them get the best of you. Now look, I'm taking your mother with me Friday night to the annual brain trust reunion dinner. A young teenager claiming he is Skeeter Wayne Dobbs, the ex-convict who was killed last week while robbing a catering truck, was found by truant officers drinking alcohol in Newter Then News, a mid-veil burlesque theater. - Frank. Here with us today is our own... - Did you hear what I said? - Dad. What exactly do you do with the brains? Oh, hey. Nice to see some interest in the old man. Actually I'm analyzing the discrepancies between the neurotransmitters of good people and bad people. - Bad people? - That's right. - So what's it gonna be? Custody of the state or custody of your father? - I'll take my chances here. - Oh thank you, officer. I'll take it from here. - Hey, make the best of it kid. You're only young once. - Oh, yeah? Take care now. - Where the hell were you? - Trying to get laid. What the hell was that? - Don't talk sass to me! - You see that? You ever touch me again, I'll call every welfare and social agency in the phone book, have you thrown in jail, divorce you, sue you, whatever it is kids are doing these days. Got it? - Skeeter Wayne Dobbs, was killed yesterday by the owner of a catering truck. The victim was wanted by the state police in connection of two teenage girls. Murder? - Hey don't forget, anyone who can provide me with the names of the individuals who perpetrated this little extracurricular science fair project, AKA vandalism, will be very much appreciated. And strictly confidential! - Hey Frankie. Hey, call me. How you doing? - Doing good. You back in school for good now? - Yeah, yeah. Why? - Oh no reason. Skeeter. - What did you say? - Oh, nothing, Skeeter. - Alright, at first I thought it was reincarnation, some Shirley McClain mojo. Hey, I could have come back as a turd. Hell, I could've come back as Shirley McClain, Frank, but that's not important right now. So I was happy with this Karl kid's skin, there's more to it. Something's not right, Frank. - You think so? - I mean, it's like, I don't know. I always knew I was a sociopath, but this schizoid thing, doesn't fly. - I put your brain in Karl's body. - Uh-huh. - I saved your life. - You sure did. You are some badass Ven Gally. - You gotta keep this a secret. - You've given me a second chance. You think I'd do anything to screw it up? It's in everyone's best interest to keep this a secret, to play it straight, am I right? Am I right? - Yeah. - Yeah. Can we get Lana back? - Who? - Turner? - No. - No, okay. Jane Mansfield? - No. - Marilyn. - No. - Okay. - Are you okay? - Yeah. - Good. How's your science project coming? - It's taken a life its own. - Good. Hey, you need help, you know where to find me. - Oh no. Hector, did you drop the Dobbs specimen? Great, a bad brain and no time to get a new one. Don't forget, if I get fired, you get fired, Hector. - Hey. Hey, what do you say we go out tonight, huh? You can show me the town, introduce me to some girls. - No I can't. - Well you do know some girls, right? - No. - Any girls? - No. - And you think I have problems. We gotta get you a girl. - I already have a girl. Who? - It's nobody. - Ask her to come with us tonight. - What? No, no, I can't. I have to house sit, my parents are going out of town. - Alright then. Hey, are there any of those Home Coming tickets left? I'd like one. - Just one? - No, no, Frank and I aren't going together anymore, it's over between us. He's in love with someone else. It is okay to go alone. - Sure. I am. - Oh really? So is Frank. - Do you need a ticket? - Sure. - It's ironic, you don't have a date, and you're the one that's selling the tickets. - Well I'm in charge of the school Treasury. - It's ironic. - As long as we're both going alone, maybe we could go alone together? - That's sweet, Frank, but I don't really know you, so thanks anyway. - Did you tell Macy about the party you're having tonight? - What party? - Blow out of the year, don't miss it. - Great. - Cheer up, we're having a party. ♪ Breeze blows through the tall grass and the sky ♪ - You are making our job a lot easier, kid. - Dope idea, Frankie. Justice. - No, no, it was Karl's. - You gotta be kidding me. - Good thing we killed him, huh? - Fun. - Buckle in for an evening of bad jokes. - I see we already got laid. I suppose a foursome's out of the question? - Ouch. - So you wahinies wanna get drunk? - He means drinks. - Please. - Here you go, ladies. - Thank you, Karl. - You know what? I was gonna get the drinks. - I couldn't be rude. - Oh I can. Hey jackhole, I got it. - Whatever chief. - Boys are so weird. - Hey, great party Frank. - Oh thanks Emily. Glad you could make it. So did you just move to LA? - We were in the third and fifth grade together. - We were? - Remember the kid who built the flying machine for the science fair? - Yeah, didn't he like crash in the monkey cars and have to go to the hospital? - Compound fracture of the appendicular clavicle. - Oh that was you. - Yeah. - Oh. - It's probably better we didn't meet until now. so you're like some kind of genius, right? - No it's not really a genius thing, it's something that everybody knows, it's just finding the right combination. - I kind of like you. - What? - Huh? Oh, I gotta go. I've been thinking about that question you asked me yesterday, and I changed my mind. Here's my number, okay, so call me. - Okay. - Bye. - Frank, that was beautiful, man. Anyway, this will cover the cleaning service. Cleaning van is on the way. Told you you could trust me. Don't wait up. Tammy. Michelle. Arlene. - Frank, Frank we're home. - Hey guys, how was your trip? - This place is cleaner than when we left. What'd you do, hire a maid service? - Dad, dad. Home Coming dance is tonight and I asked this girl and she said yes. - You're free to go. - Dad, I was hoping I could take the car. - It's a van. - Please. Dad, there's this girl. - Did you inseminate her? - The car, dad. - The car? Oh, yeah, well you show me your next report card and we'll talk about the car. - Did you know that Einstein flunked math? Okay, fair enough. You come up with a scientific breakthrough as profound as the theory as relativity and I'll give you the car, for keeps. - Frank, you've got some explaining to do. What happened to this? - What have you been feeding that thing? - I don't mind driving, really. Because this way I can control whether or not we run out of gas on the way home. - You know what? You're probably gonna have to lead, too, because I'm really not that great a dancer. - My brother, my brother Mitch, hey, what's going on, man? You sound good, you sound good. Alright, tonight I am here to announce the winners of this fall's school sanctioned popularity contest. Give me a hit man, AV Pow, AV Pow. - Here we go, man, this is the moment you've all been waiting for. This fall's Home Coming king and queen are Lance Gipple and Darian Dampenotto. What's going on? Come on up. - To all of the people that voted for me, who else were you gonna vote for? - I feel you. ♪ I guess you got what you asked for ♪ ♪ Got what you asked for ♪ ♪ Now you know the feeling ♪ ♪ There's more to this world than you'll ever know ♪ ♪ Once you set your sight on something so beautiful. ♪ - Andrea's crushed. You know what it feels like to want something for so long and never get it? - Not after today. ♪ All your life you've heard about her ♪ ♪ All your days you've thought and dreamed ♪ ♪ All your nights you're dreaming of her ♪ ♪ So tell me how you feel ♪ - You lose somebody? - No, why do you ask? - Follow me. - Karl? - Look at that. I would never in a million years do that to you. - Oh my God. - Why that asshole would risk losing an angel like you, I'll never know. I'm sorry. - Thanks. Let's get out of here. - Sure. - Water's boiling. - Sorry I'm late. - Where were you? - Smashing with your date. - She's good isn't she, brother? - Yeah. - The life of a swinger. Life's good but life's bittersweet. She's already taken. - What's mine is yours, man. Cher and Sunny alike. - Like I said, she's already been taken. - What are you talking about? - She just left with a dead guy. - Mine? - You know, you used to really freak me out but now, I don't know, you're kind of growing on me. - We're teenagers, right? It takes a while to feel comfortable in our own skin. It's a hormonal thing, I think. - You're still weird, but I like it. - You're coming with Lance, woman. - No I'm not. Now! - It's a free country. - No, no, no, no, not to Lance it's not. He's a dictator, a dick. - We'll see how hard you laugh when I reach down your throat, grab your ass and turn you inside out. - No offense sweetie, but I'd rather stick to Andrea grabbing my ass. Easy there, easy there. - Come on, come on! - Oh relax, come on man, this has nothing to do with you. - You want to dance? - Dance? Oh I like the nightlife, oh yes, I like to boogie. Oh, Tuttle. - Oh my mouth. You just broke my nose. - Hi guys, thank you, next show 8 o'clock. I'll take you home. - He broke my nose. - You should have someone look at that. - You see what he did to my nose? - I mean a doctor. Come on, let's go. - Tuttle. Look at you with your new clothes and hair and your brain. You think you're so cool. I made you man. And this is what I get in return. Go ahead, take her. She's damaged goods. - Those guys, huh? Goodnight Lance. - You got a pretty good imagination. - Yeah. - Imagine what I'll do to you if you can't fix this. - I'm gonna go wait in the car. - Listen, listen man, I know how you feel right now. I mean, I'm used to feeling like a total fool. - Shut up, man. Your monster is out of control, Frank. - But... - You made him, you gotta stop him, or Lance will. - So anyway, what was that all about. - Nothing. - So you wanna show me another galaxy? ♪ Baby you, I've got your number ♪ ♪ Baby you, you're so sublime ♪ ♪ Baby you, you're undercover ♪ ♪ Baby you, don't waste my time ♪ ♪ Don't waste my time ♪ - So who are you Macy? That's not what I meant, that sounded really weird. - It was nice, rare. - I save the tongue action for the second date. - I save the whipping gorilla suit for third. - Wow, that's kinda scary, but okay, it's cool. - I was kidding. - I knew that, I knew that. - I'm gonna go now. - Bye. ♪ Don't waste my time, don't waste my time ♪ - Do you think I'm flat? - Honestly, I can't think right now. what, what, what? You're all gross. oh my God, help! - Shh! Just calm down, calm down. Oh, come on. Women, so superficial. - Help! Help, somebody! Help, help, somebody help! Help! - Help me, I'm getting cornered by Nissan fur. - Just calm down will you Mark? You'll get your fur in just a second. - I don't want to wait a second man, I am freezing. - Okay, I'll give you fur if you can answer this question, alright? - Okay, man, give me the test, give me the test. - Where did I hide my nuts? - In the tree, in the tree. - Mr. Stockton? - Hi. I was just rehearsing for the Kindergarten science fair. Kids love squirrels. Let's talk about hats. - Hats? - Hats. Now as you know we all wear many hats in the modern world that we live in. As an example, I'm a science teacher, but I'm also the special events chairman. You are a student, but you're also the school treasurer. - Sir, you're making me really uncomfortable. - When I went to pay the caterer after the dance Friday night, do you know what I found? Next to nothing. $20. Now, as the school Treasurer, it's your responsibility to know exactly where the lockbox is. - Oh my God, I'm so sorry. - I'm gonna give you 24 hours to return the money, and if you don't, I can assure you there will be serious repercussions. Do I make myself clear? - Yes sir. - Okay fine. Just one more thing. I got a phone call from Andrea Shalonsky's mother. Now apparently Andrea didn't come home last night. You know anything about this? - No. Money, power, respect. I wouldn't worry about Andrea so much. She probably went out with that freak Karl. Slut. I'd be worrying about the missing Home Coming money if I were you. So, who was the last person to buy a ticket? - Frank. - And who threw a lavish party that evening? - Frank. - Okay, now, so who should go burning down in flames? Macy! Macy, Macy! Macy, what's going on? What? - The Home Coming ticket money is stolen and Andrea has disappeared. - Yeah but we're okay, right? - No, Frank, no, we're not okay. Look, you and Carl were the last ones with me Friday. So just tell me, honestly, was it the two of you? - No. Macy. - How did you pay for your party? - I... - You took advantage of me. No. - You know, I was really starting to like you, too. Oh and by the way, if you see your pal Karl, ask him what he did with my best friend. - Macy, Macy, Macy stop, please! - Pop! Justice. - Frank, Frank, try and keep your pants on during school, okay? People are still eating. Nice boxers. - Karl, Karl! Karl! Karl! What did you do with her? - Which her? - I made you Karl, I can break you. - Excuse me. Listen Frank, maybe you only saw the movie, but in the book, the monster wins. Look, Andrea wouldn't put out, okay? I'm too old to date without scoring. - So then, you didn't kill her? - Listen, do I look stupid enough to ruin a good thing? Well forget about what I look like, that's your fault. You know, you know I'm not gonna mess up this little fantasy. I'm sure the girl is fine, just broken-hearted over losing me. I'm such a jerk. But hey. - What about the Home Coming money? You stole that, didn't you? - How else was I gonna throw your party, huh? I was doing it for you, all for you. - Thanks for nothing. Macy broke up with me. She's given me the end of today to give her back the money or she's turning me in. - Well that wasn't part of the plan. Listen, if you pay her back, she may take you back. Now I've got an idea. - I don't need your help. - Frank, hey. Listen, I'm throwing a little swaray tonight in honor of my fellow ghouls, and I'll make sure that Macy shows up and we'll take care of this whole mess. - I said I don't need your help. Mission control, this is Houston, do you read? Let's be straight here, kid. Now you may very well be able to bring people back from the dead, but you don't have a clue about life. Now I suggest you let me help you. - What do you want me to do? - I'll pick you up at five, be sure to wear your costume. - What are you planning? - Oh relax, it's just a little pre-party prep, it'll be over before you know it. - Trick or treat. My kinda night. - So what are we doing? - The guy that works here owes me some money. Wait here and honk if you see anyone coming, okay? I'm back. - I'm closed. - Good to see you again. - I know you? - No, yeah, know me? You killed me. - What in God's name's going on here? - I figured anyone who'd clean out their truck on an empty street in the middle of the night would be an easy target. Anyway, when I pulled out the gun, you dropped to one knee and begged me not to kill you. Little did I know, you, you, you had a Darringer in your boot. - Jesus H. Christ! - Boo. I am very angry with you. Didn't think I'd let you get away with it, did you? - You got a witness here. Si. - What? Your gonna need one hell of a witness protection program. Get back in the car, get back in the car, Frank. - Freeze. - Great, great, there he goes again. Look what you made him do. Whether you kill me or let me live, I'll be back. Count on it. No money equals no Macy. You can't blame me for trying. - You were gonna kill him. - He killed me first! - You were robbing him. - If you want to graduate high school in one or two pieces, back off! - Macy, Macy, Macy. I just had to tell you that there has been a little delay but I don't want to let you down. - Okay, you can stop bothering me now. - Where are you going? - I'm going to Karl's house. - No. - Save the jealousy for someone who cares, Frank. - Absolutely not, Macy. You can't. - Why? - Because, he's dangerous, I'm warning you. Promise me that you won't go. - Weren't you the one that said he was so honest? Or did you lie about that, too? - For the last time, don't go. - God. You're not gonna stalk me now, are you? - Look, for your own good, I beg you. - Goodnight, Frank. Happy Halloween. And by the way, I'm gonna ask Karl what happened to Andrea. You better hope she's alright. The evil that lurks. - Oh, you're gonna love this. Ow. - Look Karl, I just want to know what happened between you and Andrea. - Who's Andrea? - You know how fast you were going? - How fast I was going? Not fast enough. - Death is easy, it's living that's hard. - Pretty scary. - It's nice work old man. - Was it too much? - No. - Really? - Yeah. - Great. - Oh, this S and M stuff makes me horny. Basement, evening wear, et cetera. - Ow, stop it, you're hurting me. - Over here, we have ladies fashions, and other torture devices. - So this Frankenstein monster is on a date with your ex girlfriend and you've gotta stop him? - I swear. - Sir, don't swear. - Honestly, sir. - You know, I gotta tell you, this is a very original... - I am really, really sorry, sir. - For what? - This. - I hate it when they do that. - Leave her alone. - Frank. - Frank. - Get out of here Macy. Go home. - Try a breath mint. Sorry, Frank. - You know, Frank, I'm gonna let the earlier incident slide. But you're starting to become a real hassle. Self centered, egotistical, little. - Oh God, where have you been? We've all been worried sick. - I know why I didn't win. - What? - Look out prom queen, here I come! - I snuck away to a clinic in Midville, it's a big secret. Shhh. - Play nice, boys. - Lance, you look great. - You look like a Dutch hooker. Die, Frankenjackoff. Oh my finger. - Now what? Now what? - Take a chill pill homey. - What was going on with you and Karl? - He's too tribal. He's into scarification and body mutilation, not my type. Of course, that doesn't mean that I would miss a good party. - You know Tuttle, you are such an asshole that I'm thinking I might actually be able to make it back into heaven by killing you. - Looking for these bullets? - Tuttle, you wake up, don't you leave me. I need you, you're all I have in this world. Tuttle! Frank. Frank. Yodelayheehoo. Frank, you sure you got the guts for murder, boy? - I figure I can give you life, I can take it. No, please don't kill me, please. - Look, don't take this personal. I made a big mistake, okay? I have to fix it. - You need me. Please, Frank, we were the best. We were gonna be on cereal boxes together. - No, no, no, we're not a team, I don't need you. I don't need to be popular. I don't need to be someone that I'm not. - That doesn't seem to be working out too well for me either. - Tuttle, Lance? - Oh, well that's a surprise. Come on, we gotta find Frank. - Hey, you know what? There was this great comedy traffic school over in Midville. Next time, don't run. - You're not such a bad guy. What matters most is what's on the inside. What do you think? - Dad I need your help. Dad! - Frank? Thank God, I've been looking all over for you. I mean, you're in big trouble. - I know. Lance and Tuttle killed Karl, I brought Karl back to life. But since he had massive head injuries, I had to use a brain from your workplace as a replacement. So basically I turned Karl into Skeeter Wayne Dobbs and Skeeter turned out to be pretty bad, so I had to kill him again. - Whoa, what are you saying? - I tweaked the theory of heavy electron resurrection. I did it, dad. I got it to work. Now I gotta do it again and I need your help. I gotta take the bad brain out and put in the good. - Well I'm sorry, Frank, but I can't help you. The good brain's already gone. - What? Oh my God. - But there is this other brain. I think it was dropped, but I sutured the torn lobe and I made some repairs to the cornextural synapsis. - You fixed Karl's brain, that's incredible. That's never been done before. Dad, you did this? - You're proud of me? - Yeah, I'm proud of you. - Did you really bring that boy back? - Yeah. - Well you're not so bad yourself. - Thanks. - Buddy. - You'll help me out? - Frank, you show me your brain, I'll show you mine. - Let's not get carried away, dad. - Sorry. Okay, so, where do we start? - Can we use your desk? - Of course. This is just an analyzing tool, Frank. I don't know if it's gonna work. - It'll work, it has to work. - Looks familiar to me. - I think it's kind of part of your stereo. - My A track? Let's rock. - I'm sorry, Frank. I guess... Van's all yours, Frank. - Karl? - Ow. - You really did it. You gave him our car. Why? - It's between Frank and me. Do you know that Einstein flunked math? - No. - Well he did. - Baby, baby, you look so good. - Hey, you two don't have to do that he-man act for me anymore. The entire school knows. - What? - You know, Ellen, Elton, Bert and Ernie, Lance and Tuttle. It's common knowledge. It's okay, I still love you. Oh, hi. - Hi guys. - Marcy, Marcy! Marcy! - Macy, sir. - Would you please just turn around a minute? I have something very important to discuss with you. I owe you a very big apology. I was cleaning out my desk this morning, and I found this. Our money. - You had it the whole time? - Please forgive me, please? I didn't know it was there. It was buried underneath all these squirrel pelts. You remember Mark? - You really fool anybody with that gag last night? It really, really sucked. - It was pretty stupid, huh? I'm sorry about that. - Yeah it was stupid. - Do you wanna hang out after school today? - Mr. Popular? How am I supposed to believe you're not popular anymore? - Hey, believe me, I'm not. - Are those your books? - No. You got Hanked. - Welcome back. - See you, man. - Sir, there's someone I gotta talk to. - Sure. - Frank, I owe you an apology. - If I could just.. - Teenagers. ♪ Hey baby, you, I've got your number ♪ ♪ Baby, you, you're so sublime. ♪ ♪ And baby, you, you're undercover ♪ ♪ Baby, you, don't waste my time ♪ ♪ Don't waste my time ♪
