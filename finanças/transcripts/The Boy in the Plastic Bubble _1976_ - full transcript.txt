Honey? Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Lubitch. Hi, Doctor. I've just come from the hospital. The tests are in, and you're pregnant. Congratulations. That's wonderful Did you hear that, honey? Call me if I can be of any help with your decision. Yeah, I'll do that, Doctor. Thanks very much. Johnny? I know, honey. I know. I don't want to lose another baby. Oh... I couldn't bear it. I just couldn't. No way in the world we're going to lose this child. Look... First of all, the odds are four to one against there being any problem at all this time. Honey, even if the worst happened and this baby is born with no immunities, this time we're ready. I mean, immunologists like Dr. Gunther, they know how to save these children now. But how can we make a decision like that? For another human being? I mean, what if--? Oh, Johnny, do you think we could live with it? Oh... There were never two people in the world more meant to be parents than you and me. God knows that. I want to believe that. Oh, I want to believe that. A baby... We're gonna have a baby. A baby? Mr. Lubitch? Yes, Doctor? If you'd like to say something to your wife before... Hello, Mrs. Lubitch. I just wanted to say, um... I love you. I love you. May we have the air conditioning ducts and the heat vents closed, please? And no movement while the air settles. Anybody down there planning on having an itch, please scratch it now. Not later, please. Dr. Gunther, do we have to have all these people here? May we please clear the theater? I'm sorry. Please try to understand. We're private people. Begin the cesarean. I just saw him, and he's a beautiful baby. Johnny, what a beautiful baby he is. Look at those blue eyes. Hey, Toddy. It's your daddy. I think he knows me. How were the tests? Mr. and Mrs. Lubitch, he was born exactly like your first son. No immunities whatsoever. But he's alive. How long does he have to stay in this? There's no way to know. Until we discover a treatment, until he develops an immune system of his own, he'll have to remain in his protected environment. Surely you can give us some kind of prediction. I mean, are we talking about days or weeks or months? Years. Excuse me? Mr. Lubitch, you may as well have it straight. We could get lucky, or your son could be here with us for the remainder of his life. May I? Of course. Shh. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Are you going over there this morning, honey? What for? I didn't hear you. I said, what for? Hey, what's the matter? Oh, I hate seeing that little girl. I'm always looking at her. You almost fell out! Did you almost fall? Kind of sorry they moved next door. I want my baby. Mickey, look. Suppose we could devise some way of transporting him safely, and we could get them to go on paying for it. And then there's a million other things we'd have to go through. The sterilization and the food and the toys and the equipment. I don't think you realize what we'd be getting ourselves into. Do you? Well... You stay home and get some rest. I'll give him a big hug for both of us. Okay? Take me high! Oh, higher? Yeah! You're such a big girl! Give me a kiss. Oh, boy! Wanna play ball? Wanna play ball? Get your ball. We're gonna toss. You get over here, why don't you? Okay, look out. Here it comes. Oh, good! Try it again. Now you throw it to me. Good one! Good man! Throw it right here. I don't know if I'm going to make a pitcher or a catcher out of you. Okay, Toddy, throw me a nice, hard one. There you go. That's a good boy! Here it comes. There you go. Hey, look who's here, Toddy, it's Mommy. Surprised to see me? No. No? What about you, short stuff? Huh? Are you surprised to see Mommy? Yeah. You are? Oh, I bet I can do something fun to you. I bet I can tickle you and make you giggle. Come here, come here. Do you know how much your Mommy and Daddy love you? Do you? Do you really? Do you know how much Mommy and Daddy love you? Hm? Do you? And how much we want you all to ourselves? I do! I love you. I'm going to tickle baby. I want to get him again. I'm gonna get him again! Wanna give me another kiss? Give me a kiss. Here they come. Hurry up, set up. I got a microphone. We rolling? Pick up the ambulance. Little Tod Lubitch. A child who has never felt his parents touch, except through the walls of his plastic bubble, and who may not for years to come, is finally coming home for the first time today. There's Mrs. Lubitch getting out of the ambulance. Mr. Lubitch. The doctor. Please, everybody, we appreciate your interest, but this is exactly what we're trying to get away from. Hey, Toddy, did you have a nice ride? There you go. Would you back up, everybody, please? Mrs. Lubitch-- Do you mind backing up? Oh, my, I didn't realize he was so big. Isn't he adorable? Gina, come on back here. I'll get her. Will he have to live in that thing very long? Please, fellas, no pictures. What is it like, Mrs. Lubitch, to never touch your son? I've asked you nicely. Please leave us be. Mr. Lubitch, come out and-- You take one more step and I'll knock your damn head off. Now get out of here. Come on, all of you. Just back up. I'm a monster! I'm a monster! I'm a monster! My son's not a freak. Come on. Let's get out of here. Okay, filters and fans. They're okay. All right. Back-up generator? It's okay. So your breaker and fuse panels... That's all right. Okay. And intercom system. Right. That's it. Are you sure we have checked everything? Well, everything except champagne. Oh. Huh? Well, um... In that case, I'm just going to tuck him in, and I'll see you in a minute. Don't you be long. Okay. Good night, Toddy. Come on, darling, it's night-night time. Come on! That's my darling. You have pleasant dreams. You talk to your teddy bear, okay? Mommy loves you. I'll see you in the morning. Ooh! Oh, wow! Champagne okay. Do you realize... how long it's been? Hm? Yeah. Yeah. Mmm-hmm. He's not getting any air. Toddy? What is it? Honey, check the fans! Toddy, what is it? What is it? I don't know what to do. Everything's running. Check the generator? You look at it. It could be the equipment... Toddy! Toddy, what is it? Toddy? Oh, my God. He swallowed it! Lift him up. Toddy. Toddy, come on now. Daddy's gonna lift you up. Come on, you got to spit it out, baby. Spit it out! Spit it out! Hit him hard, honey. Spit it up, Toddy. Spit it up! Come on, Toddy. Come on! Come on, spit it up. Spit it up! Get it out, baby. Oh, Toddy. I'm sorry, baby. Are you okay? Toddy. Oh, baby, I'm sorry. Are you okay? Yeah. Oh, sweetheart, you okay now? Oh, I'm sorry I had to hit you. You poor baby. We did it. We sure did. Mrs. Lubitch? Yes? Well, I know we should have called first. Oh, well, our number's not listed. Well, we were just waiting for the proper time to say hello. I'm Pete Biggs. My wife, Martha. And our daughter, Gina. We live right next door there. Yes, I know. I should have been the one to welcome you into the neighborhood, but, uh... Here! It's a welcome-home present for your little boy. Well, thank you. Thank you. That's very kind of you. Please, come in. I'm sorry I haven't been that friendly, but we just don't have that many visitors. There, that's good Toddy. Now put the blue one here. See if you can stack another blue one on it. Oh, you're going to put it up there, huh? Oops. Here, try the-- Honey, look who's here. The Biggs from next door came over to welcome Tod home. Oh, look, Toddy. Hey, Toddy! Look over there. Toddy, look who's here. This is Gina! Come say hello to Gina. Gina's brought you a present, which Daddy's gonna sterilize. Come on over here, Gina. Toddy, come on. Say hi to Gina. Come on, Toddy. Let me go! Let me go! Oh, he's not hurting you. He's just playing with you. Is this your playhouse? Can I come in? Can I? Yeah! Hey, Gina, what do you wanna do? I don't know. Want to go down to the dock? It must be real weird living right next door to that kid. Oh, no, not really. I hardly ever see him except for birthdays and stuff. Half the time he's at the hospital, anyway. Come on! He's always watching television. You know? He never comes out of his room. Does he have any friends? Mm-mm. Just old people. Like friends of his parents. Bunch of doctors that come over. And some minister comes over once in a while. But no kids or anything. Oh, he has this little pet germ-free mouse too. Don't you ever wonder what it's like in there? I mean, to be all by yourself like that. Yeah. Yeah, I know. But he's weird, you know? Like, I'm surprised he isn't looking at us right now. Every time I look up there, he's looking right at me. The last and, NASA hopes, the longest of the Skylab... Capney! Hey, Capney! How are you? Huh? The astronauts breezed through... However, the repair of the bowl-shaped radar antenna proved a more difficult task. Located on the underside of Skylab's multiple docking adapter section, the antenna is used to measure irregularities in ground temperatures and the shape of the Earth. Performing like an acrobatic team, they worked for three hours on the faulty antenna till it was finally free enough to do most of its programmed Earth scanning job. Earlier today, after the astronauts docked their command module with Skylab, they settled in and started their housekeeping chores. After a rest period of two hours, they had their first meal in Skylab. Hello, Mickey. Good afternoon, Ernie. Please come in. Honey? Look who's here to see you. Hello, Tod. Good afternoon, Ernie. And how are we feeling today? My main reason for driving out here today, instead of waiting for your monthly check-up, there's some news I think you might like to hear. Queen's in check, Ernie. Oh, yeah, you're right. A doctor in Tokyo believes he may have found a treatment that might stimulate the development of the humeral and cellular antibodies. What kind of research has he done? So far, not too extensive. But the middle of next year-- Good news, Ernie. Keep me posted, will you? You've really got it made, haven't you? Why do you say that? Because you've got the best excuse ever devised by anybody to avoid growing up. I'm growing up, Ernie. Yes. Sometimes you're like an old man. And other times you're like a newborn baby. What does that mean? Why do you use that intercom when you don't need to? Does it give you a feeling of power over us? Is it your way of getting back at us? Oh, you're angry at me today, aren't you, Ernie? Yes. You're right. I am. Well, look, Ernie, you don't know any more than you did in the beginning, do you? I mean, so why should I care about what's going on out there? Why should I care about anything that's going on out there? Because there may be a cure at any time. The doctor in Tokyo, your own body... Oh, bull. You know, I'm not so unhappy in here as all of you think. Really. I'll see you, Tod. Carter had greased the railing on the stairway between the first and second floor, and Mr. Brister took quite a nasty tumble. Tod, the school board called me today. And a company back east has donated a closed-circuit television system. Oh, yeah? Yeah. And they want to know if you would like to use it to monitor some classes in the high school. What classes? Any classes you want. Come on, you're not afraid to test that brain of yours against the other kids, are you? No. Honey, if it's too abrupt a step for you, that's okay. I didn't mean to sound as if I was pushing him. Tell me more about that doctor that Ernie was talking about. You know, the one from Tokyo. Well, we haven't heard anything about him yet, honey. But there is a hematologist in Finland that's-- I gotta think about that school thing. May I please be excused? Of course, darling. Sure. Hey. Hey! What is all this? Don't you know? Girl, it's your neighbor. The boy in the bubble. He's monitoring classes on TV, and he chose our homeroom. He did? Yeah! Come on. Tom, get off my feet! Now, Deborah and Linda, please sit down. Go on, we have someone new in our class. All right, you're on, Tod. I can't see anything. Well, try your scanner button. Hey, Gina, your true love has found you. Tod, can you hear me? Hi, Dad. Hi. I want you to meet your homeroom teacher. This is Mr. Brister. Good morning, Tod. Would you like to say something to the class before we begin? Hi, everybody. So if the Truman administration was "The Fair Deal," and the Kennedy administration "The New Frontier," and the Johnson administration called itself "The Great Society," What was the Roosevelt administration? Tom Shuster? Gwen? Who's making that sound? Gina Biggs? Uh, sorry, Mr. Brister. I didn't read the chapter. Tod? The New Deal. Good. Now... What's so funny? All right, this has gone far enough. Unless every one of you wants to be sent down to the principal's office, you'll cut it out right now. Hey, Tom, go out for a pass. Okay. You know, if they can take him to and from the hospital in that small bubble, why don't they ever carry him outside or down to the beach or something? They've been suggesting it for years but Tod won't have any part of it. He says it'll make him feel like a freak being put on display. Gina, go over to the Lubitch's, ask Tod if he'd like to come to the 4th of July party at the beach. Why don't you just call his parents or something? I want it to come from you. All right, I'll try. Um, Missy... Mm-hmm. Hi, Mrs. Lubitch. Hi, Gina. Uh, is Tod home? Is Tod home... Yes, Tod is home. Go on up and see him. Thank you. Tod? Hey in there. It's me. Surprised to see me? Well, aren't you going to say something...like hi. Hi. Hey, you know, I've always wondered about this. What's that? How come this part is open? I mean, don't germs get in? Oh. Well, you see, behind this wall there's lots of air vents that constantly blow out all the air so that germs won't get in. See this line down here, I cant walk passed it. No kidding? No. You mean I couldn't put my foot over that line? No, your germs will get in. Yeah. Hey, Tod, my mom said that you've never even been sick or anything. Not even a cold. Is that-- Is that true? Yeah, how do you like that? Wow. So when are you supposed to get out? Oh, I don't know. Keep on looking for treatments but they've been looking for them all my life. But my immunities keep on building up, I know that. So even if they don't find a treatment you'll get out some day? Yeah, someday. Well, um, the reason I'm here is, um, I wanted to invite you to the 4th of July party at the beach. If you can't make it, you know, everybody will understand but at least you know that we wanted you to come. Well, hope you can make it. Yeah, okay, let's head out. Okay. Pete, lets put it over here by the rocks, there's an outlet over there. Okay. Put him in the sand? No. Hey, Fred, could you give us a hand getting Tod down here. Yeah, can you get on either side here. Okay, I'm gonna release it right now. Okay, there we go. Easy. There we go. Okay, let me get the... plug here. Honey, you want to turn the switch on? Okay. Happy 4th of July, son. Okay, where's food? Here. Hi, Tod. Glad you could come. What do you think of my horse? Oh, I love him. I watch you feed him every morning and I love to watch you ride him. Do you always talk like that? I love this, I love that. But I do, I really do. Yeah, but I mean, you shouldn't tell people. Why not? Because people will think you're dumb. Oh. So you like my horse, huh? Well, maybe I'll let you ride him when you get out. Will you? Will you really, Gina? See you later. Hey, I dare you. How much? I'll give you $2 if you hold his hand through the fireworks. Let me see the money. I don't believe you. Are you going to do it? Right here. Okay. Oh, no. Hi, Tod. Hi. Tod... Let's hold hands. What for? I would just like to hold hands with you. Don't you know? When two people like each other, especially a boy and a girl, they like to hold hands. Gina... Yes? ...do you really like me? Well, hold my hand and find out. Shh, your mother. Gina, where are you going? All right, you turkeys, cough up the money. Good job. One, two. Look at him, he doesn't know he's a pawn. Gina, why did you run away for? Come back, talk to me. Tod... Don't you know it was a dare? They dared me so I had to do it. Oh, God. I, uh-- You didn't think I was serious, did you? I hate it! Tod? Tod! Tod! Tod! I hate it! Let me out! I hate it! Tod, no, no, no. What's the matter, Tod? What happened? What did she say to you? What did you say to him? Tod, we'll take you home. I don't want to go home. Just take me to the hospital. Take me to the hospital! All right! Baby... This isn't the way to my room. You won't be staying in the old part of the hospital, Tod. You'll be staying here in the new Laminar Air Flow Center. Because of what we've learned through cases like yours we are now treating cancer patients undergoing chemo therapy, leukemia patients, all kinds of people, young and old who've developed immune deficiencies like yourself, for one reason or another. I've taken the liberty of tentatively selecting your roommate. A roommate? But if you're unhappy, I'm sure something can be arranged. Tod Lubitch, meet Roy Slater. Hi. Well, I'll leave you two fellas to get to know each other. I hear you've been in one of these things all your life. What's that been like? Me, I've been here a couple of months and, I don't know, I sure miss a lot of things. What's the matter with you? Tumor. So why are you in one of these things? The chemo therapy kills off all my immunities. You know, I'm really glad I got someone to talk to now. They tried me with a couple of others before but you're the first one who's even close to my age. I sure hope we can become friends. Hey! Hey, why don't you talk to me? I have so many things I want to ask you. Just let me ask you one question, okay? Okay. What do you do to start liking it? Tod? Aren't you going to answer me? You said I could ask you one question. Yeah, well, I didn't say I would answer it. Okay, okay! Ill answer anything you want. Just stop crying, all right? You mean it? Yeah, I mean it, you dorko. Tod? Yeah? When are you supposed to get out? I don't know. They tell me my immunities are building up, but who knows? I may never get out of this damn thing. If I was never going to get out of here I don't think I would keep going on, you know? Easy. You could do it easy. You know what really bugs me? What? When they discovered the tumor I was too young for girls, you know? Yeah. And now that I'm old enough I can't do anything about it. Sometimes I just get so... I can't stand it. I think of all my friends out there, going to drive-ins and making out, getting all that action. You know, the first thing I'm going to do when I get out of here is get me-- Myself a hooker. Wouldn't you be afraid of all the germs? Germs? I want the germs. I want to be dirty, really dirty, you know. I want to grow my hair real long, and have a beard and a mustache and I want to make out with everything that walks. Roy? Yeah? Do you ever, um... do you ever, you know... All the time. Me too. Elsewhere in the news, Astronaut Buzz Aldrin visits young Tod Lubitch, the boy who has grown up inside a plastic bubble. That's Tod. I want to see this, hold on. He's coming home next week. So what? Shh. Hi, Tod. You're Buzz Aldrin, aren't you? The man who walked on the moon. Oh, God, I don't believe this. You know, I've been looking forward to meeting you, Tod. I hear you have the record for longest time in a command module. Yeah, I guess so. I got a little something for you too. "To Tod, champion space man on Earth. Buzz Aldrin." Thank you. Hey, you spent some time in one of these things, didn't you? Right after the moon flight. Something very much like it, Tod. We were in germ control quarters for several weeks. What was it like for you? The thing I remember most was the loss of freedom. You know, I felt like being in a fishbowl. Yeah, I know what you mean. Tod Lubitch, the boy who spent his life in a plastic bubble. No, Tom, my parents are going to be home in a bit, okay? What is it with you and that freak? He's my next-door neighbor. We grew up together. Is there anything wrong with that? Don't call him a freak. I think you're turning on to him. Oh, Tom, you're such an idiot. How long have I lived next to him, 12 years? I've probably spoken to him maybe a dozen times at the most. Every year I got an invitation to his birthday party and every year I went. I was the only one there, except for his parents. It's the only time I ever saw him, just once a year. Except for the 4th of July. Mr. Lubitch? Yeah, what is it, Gina? I'm in a big rush. I hear Tod's going to monitor some classes again this year. That's why I'm rushing. I got books and supplies to pick up. Hey, listen, I can do all of that if you want. What's the catch, Gina? Well, the main thing is I feel bad about what happened, and I'd like to help out. And the other thing is I-- I'm broke and I could really use the money. Okay, that's a deal. Hello? I brought you the books and supplies that you needed and your homework's in there too. Well, I guess I'll see you tomorrow. Oh, if you want me to bring any class work with me to school in the morning, have your mom leave it on the front porch and I'll pick it up on my way. Wait a minute. I want to ask you something. Why are you doing this? Just because I want to. Does my father have anything to do with it? Well, yeah, kind of. Is he paying you? Yeah. Thank you for being honest. You can go now. No, but I suggested it. What I mean is... Oh, it's always so hard to talk to you. You take everything so literally. Say what you started to say. Do you have to use that thing? It's killing my ears. Say what you started to say. Well, I thought a lot about what happened last 4th of July. And I wanted to make it up to you somehow. And when I saw your father at school today, well... I was going to do it for nothing, but another part of me said, well... I understand. You're not mad at me anymore? Hey, um, does that Mr. Brister look as old in person as he does on television? Oh! Mr. Brister. God, I hate that guy. Yeah, me too. Hey, how come you're never wearing anything except shorts? Because it's so warm in here. Really, Tod. I mean, when I come over the least you could do is put on some clothes. How long has it been since you've had a shower? Oh, I can't have showers, and baths are a major production. You should see, it takes a couple of hours just to sterilize the water. It must stink in here. Oh, no, no, you're wrong. No germs, no smell. I don't know, Tod. It's just the principle of the thing, you know. Well, hastamañana. Thus, despite Wilson's stand on the League of Nations, Congress had voted against the entry of the United States. American now embraced a policy of isolationism, focusing her attentions inward on domestic concerns. Thereby pursuing a course of action which was ultimately to pave the way for World War II. For tomorrow we will read chapters 4, 5, and 6. I wish you wouldn't look at me like that. Look, I didn't come yesterday because I couldn't. Look, to begin with, Mr. Goodwin made me stay after class to rewrite that term paper for English Lit, and then I got called down to the principal's office for a nice little talking to. And then when I got home my parents-- Gina, you don't have to lie to me. I'm not lying to you, and stop using that thing. It hurts my ears. You can go now, Gina. I'm not your slave, Tod. So don't give me orders. You're just like everybody else. Nobody ever believes me. I'm flunking out of school, that's how come I had to stay. The only course I have higher than a D is Art. I didn't know that, Gina. Well, now you do. And you can forget about me coming over anymore since everyone thinks I'm letting them down, last thing I need is the same garbage from you. Gina, I'm sorry. Maybe I could help you. How? I can explain things better than those dumb teachers. I can teach you how to really concentrate. You would do that? Sure. Hey, what's my father paying you? A dollar an hour. Well that's how much I charge. Gina, you can see my rates, they're right over here. Okay, it's a deal. Tod, how do you like my hair better? Up in a ponytail like this, or maybe straight down, like this? Well, which do you like better? I think I like it straight down better, don't you? You think I'm beautiful, don't you? So do I. Hey, Tod. For the test tomorrow, do you think we could do it another way? What do you mean? Let me cheat off your paper. Gina... Tod, what are you doing? I'm finished. Oh, of course. But wait until the others are finished before you hold up your answers. I'm sorry, Mr. Brister. Careful, Mom. You got it? Yeah. You okay, Dad? Yeah. All right. Okay. Very good. Excellent. Where do you wanna go? To the right. My right or your right? My right. Right. All right. There we go. Yeah, right in the sun. Excellent. Okay? Okay. Oh. La-la-la. Hey, you, what's this sudden interest in all the great outdoors? I need a tan. Need a what? A what? I need a tan. Well, look at me. I look like a tuna fish. All white and everything. You know, you guys could use a little sunshine yourselves. You're starting to look real old. Tod... Dad, I don't mean to hurt your feelings, but it's true. I mean, you never take a vacation or buy new clothes. Look at that dress, Mom. Dad, you never do anything for yourselves. Tod? Yeah? Do you ever blame us for bringing you into the world? Did you have a choice? Yes. Well, do you blame yourselves? Sometimes. Mom, Dad, I don't blame you for anything. Honest. I love you. I love you both, don't you know that? Look, if it weren't for what you did I would've grown up in the hospital. You know, you should hire a nurse from the hospital to take care of me. So then you could go someplace that you always wanted to go to. Tod... Dad, it'd be okay. I'd love it. I mean, just knowing that you weren't spending your whole life on me, okay? Do it. Sweetheart, I'll meet you outside. Rachel, don't forget to test the backup generator at least once a day. And if anything goes wrong don't hesitate to call us. Don't worry about a thing. We'll be at that number. Goodbye. Have a good trip. Honey, I hope we're doing the right thing. So much could go wrong. Sure we are. This trip is for him too, you know. Give him a little growing room. Make him feel like he can stand on his own two feet. You know what I think? What? I think part of the reason he wanted us out of the way was so he could court his girl. Yeah. Tod? Bye-bye. Goodbye, son. Tod, look, my report card for the semester. An A in Art and all the rest are B's. No kidding? Well, thanks to you. Yeah. Hey, let's celebrate, okay? How? I don't know. Think of something you'd like to do. Something special. Oh, Tod, really the way you look at me sometimes, honestly. Well, think of something. Okay, take me riding with you. Oh, sure, what are you going to do? Just walk out of there? I might. No, dummy, just help Rachel take me outside so I can watch you. Are you crazy? The two of us will never get you downstairs. Sure. Sure you could, easy. See? I told you it would work. Okay, keep on going, my slaves. Oh, Tod! All right, a little more to the left. Okay, that's it. Put me down. That's it, thank you. Gina, come here. Rachel, would you plug me in in the extension? When she does that, would you turn off the battery? Okay. Okay. That's it, Rachel. Plug it in. Excellent. Thank you. Thank you, Rachel. You can go now. Gina, ride for me, okay? Okay. Gina, go around that tree and then jump over the canoe and come back as fast as you can. Gina, you move so fast. What does it feel like to move that fast? It feels like flying. Gina, ride around me in a circle as close as you can, okay? But what about the cord? What about the cord? You just jumped that canoe. You can jump that stupid cord. What about your nurse? This is the time of day when she drinks sherry. She'll just sit there and look at the plug and make sure it doesn't come out and then she'll get pleasantly bombed. So don't worry about her, okay? Okay. Faster, Gina! Faster, faster! Faster, Gina! Now jump over me, Gina. No way, Tod. Jump over me, Gina! Come on. Gina, you jumped over the canoe. I've seen you jump twice as high. Tod, what if I miss? Gina, you won't miss. I know you. You're too talented to miss. Tod, you are really a weird kid, do you know that? Yeah, I know it. Just do it, Gina, okay? Okay. Dear lord. That was so great. I was so scared. Were you scared? Not once. Oh, I don't believe you. Aren't you ever gonna get out of this thing? I don't know. I gotta split. Listen, I'll be back later to help you get inside, okay? Which one is he? Well, that's Tom. Bruce drives a blue Chevy. Is he the one you're going with? Who says I'm going with anybody? Tod, put your face up against the plastic. What for? I did what you wanted me to do, now do it. Oh. Have I told you you look terrific? Oh, thank you. You take the presents and I'll get the bags. Come on, let's surprise him now. You want to do it now? Is it open? Yup. Tod? Hi. Hi. Hey, Toddy. Hi, babe. Did you have a good time? Yes. How was it? It was fine. Tod, listen, what's this about Gina jumping over you with her horse? Oh, it's nothing. Hmm? Did she tell you that? She drinks. Oh, Tod. No, she probably imagined it. Tod that's wicked. I got something I want to tell you. I want to go to school. Yeah. But you are in school. No, I mean really go to school. Dr. Gunther said he would set it up if you guys said it would be all right. Here, look, I'll show you. See? Pretty neat, huh? Oh, my goodness. Okay, Tod, come on out. Let's go. You sure you want to go today? Yeah. Okay, let's go. Okay, last time. What's the first thing you do when you get to your home room? Pledge of allegiance. The first thing, you ding-a-ling. All right, all right. First thing I do is check the backup tanks. And? And the batteries. Come on, Dad, can't you go any faster? Just leave the driving to me. Okay, listen, the filters and the fans are fine, the batteries are up, but the pressure gauge on the main line reads 75 percent, then what do you do? I don't do anything. I just stay there and I get my teacher to go get you, and then you take me home, right? Okay. Good. But I want you to check everything on your checklist every break between classes, or I'll break your arm. All right. Okay. Get your current where you find it. Think of yourself as a rechargeable flashlight. Because you want me to be bright, right? Little joke, Dad. Very. Ha. You're on your own. Mr. Brister? Yes, Gina. I just wanted to say that, um, I think it's really brave of Tod to do this, and I think we should all show him how glad we are that he's here. Come on, everybody, stand up. Come on, get up. Come on. I heard from every place I applied to except for Yale. Gwen, I heard you were accepted to Colorado. Yeah. Yay! Did you hear from your art school? No, not yet. Oh, don't worry about it. You'll hear from them. Hey, you guys, why don't we go over and talk to Tod? I don't know, he's really weird. He is weird. Come on. Oh, come on, let's do this. I'd rather not. Then don't. Hi, Tod. Hi. Tod, I want you to meet some of my friends. You know Tom and Bruce. And this is Gwen, and Debbie... Hi. ...and Smith. Hey, man, how you doing? I see you got yourself all plugged in. Hi. Hi. I saw you on the news. You look great. I'm Tom. No, man, we do it like this. This means we're brothers. Hey. Hey. How much time do you have on one tank? Ninety minutes. And then what? Then I recharge. It's what I'm doing right now. See? I'm recharging. Hey, can I ask you a question? Yes. Do you ever feel like a visitor from outer space? Yes. Me too. Listen, Tod, we were all about to take a little walk over to the football field. Would you like to come with us? Hey, no more practical jokes. You can trust us. Yeah. I think we've grown up a little since last summer. Okay. Hey, when I pull this plug out, would you turn my battery on? That little black dial? Okay. All right, when I say ready. Ready? Go. Yeah. Hey, Tod? Yeah? There's something I've been wanting to ask you. Sure. How do you go to the bathroom? Oh, the same as the astronauts do. You mean...? Sure. Sorry I asked. I'm sorry, but I just can't help it. He looks so funny in that thing. Look, his little booties. Tod, Tod, it's not you. It's just your suit. Hey, you got to be able to laugh at yourself. I mean-- I mean, you got to. It's funny. Little ponytail. Oh, that's it, that's it. Little ponytail. Hey, hey, don't blow a fuse. I know what this is like. What? What what's like? I know that's like. Oh. You know what I do? What I do is I stare at an object for a long time. Any object, right? And then I let myself sink deeper and deeper inside my brain until I find the center place that I like. Have you guys ever heard of out of body travel? Oh, sure, I saw a thing about it on Twilight Zoneonce. It's where you can leave your body and go anywhere you want. That's right. Well, I do it all the time. Oh, yeah? Where do you go? Lots of different places, but mostly the planet that I'm from, Thomapolous. Right. Come on, Thomapolous. I think-- I think it's an exchange program. You see, I was sent here, and someone from here was sent there. One day we'll be switched back again. If it weren't for this secret journal I found, I would have never known anything about it. Are you putting us on? No. Let me look inside that thing, Tod Lubitch. Look at that straight face. Hey, no! I think you are from another planet. It's time to go. We got to go back. Hey, Tom, I bet you didn't know that people on Thomapolous were stronger than people on Earth. No kidding? Stronger in what way? Just stronger. Like for instance, I bet I can beat you at doing push-ups. You talking about real money or space money? I'm talking $10. Ten dollars. Ooh! Wow, 10 bucks. Whoo! Sounds okay to me. Let's make it the kind you have to clap in the middle, all right? All right. Hey! Come on! Hey, Tod, uh, do you think you should do this? I mean, what about your air? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. Yay, Tod! See that? Hey, Tod! Tod, what's the matter? Are you all right? No air. Get me to the bubble. Quick! He'll be okay. I know he's gonna be all right. Tod? Tod, are you all right? He's getting air. Please don't tell my father. Oh, no, we won't tell anybody. Hey, where's my 10 bucks? I think he's all right. Tod... I got to talk to you. I know, you're mad at me, aren't you? Yes, I'm mad at you. For embarrassing you in front of your friends? No, for nearly killing yourself trying to show off for me. But, Gina, I was just-- Tod, what if you had died out there? How could I ever live with that? I'm sorry, Gina. No, you're not. You don't care. You don't care what happens to you, Tod. Sometimes I think you want to die. Gina, I was just doing it so you would see. See what? That you're just as dumb as all the rest of them? Flexing your muscles? No, that you'd see that I'm not a cripple, and that there's nothing wrong with me except I can't get out of here until they tell me it's okay. Oh, Gina, I'm so sick of it. I'm so sick of feeling like a hospital case, like some weirdo kid who can't even breathe normal air because he might get sick and die. I just want to be like a man, someone you can care about and not feel sorry for. Tod... Tod, I don't know what you're doing to me. And I don't know if I like it at all. I don't know anything anymore. Look, we were just supposed to be friends. I mean, that's all that was supposed to happen, right? I mean, can't we just-- Just leave it like that? You obviously spend a great deal of time with her... I just wanted to know why. Nola, why are you doing this to yourself? Hello? Yes. Gina, it's for you, sweetheart. Sorry, I should've told you. You want to watch the sports news on Channel 3? You can be pretty persuasive...No? ...when you want to find something out. Hello? Gina? Hi. Um, you want to go to the beach tomorrow? Okay. All right. Oh, Tod, here. Yeah! Oh, this is great. It's going up so high, wow. Oh, honey, look at him. Just look at him. Tod, you got five minutes left on your tank! This was fun today. Why couldn't you have had a space suit when you were a little kid? Oh, when I was little, I never even dreamed about going out. Only about people and things coming in. You were always riding your horse in. Yeah, and then I'd get on and we'd ride and ride and ride. Inside your bubble? Yeah, always inside. All my life I've wondered what it's like to be you. And all my life I always wondered what it was like to be you. I've always loved you, you know. I know. Anthony Jerome. Dennis Johnson, Jr. Peter Justice. Chad Stenson. Tod Lubitch. Tod Lubitch? Congratulations. Hey, Tod! Hey, Tod! Whoo! Tod! You can see it went down by half a foot. Tod? Hey, Tod. Look, it just came in the mail. I wanted you to be the first to know. My acceptance at Pratt Institute. I start art school in September, Tod, in New York City, and it never would have happened if you hadn't helped me. That's great, Gina. It really is. Hey, Tod, I won't be leaving for a while. Hello, Tod. What do you want to see me about? I want to know when I can leave, Ernie. Well, within the past week I've been in telephone communication with a team of physicians in the Soviet Union. How soon can I leave on my own immunities? You know I can't answer that. What would happen if I left now? You're not actually considering-- Would I catch something and die right away? I really don't know. You mean I might live? Yes, it's conceivable. Your body has been building up some immunities. But it's also conceivable that just a bad cold or a case of flu might kill you. I'm sorry, but we just don't know. Thank you for coming, Ernie. Tod, if somewhere in that brain of yours you're actually thinking of... I was just asking, Ernie. That's all. Tod! Hey, Gina. Oh, so much softer then I ever imagined. Gina, take me for a ride. It'd be all right. Okay. Where are we going? To Thomapolous!
