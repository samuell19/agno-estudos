[MUSIC PLAYING - UNDER THE BOARDWALK] [radio tuning] -Bogus swell, brah. -Huh? -Totally bogus swell, man. -Ah Skeeg, you gonna bail on me? -Nah. But I'm heavily agged, man. -Let it rest, brah. Yo, look at those fucking kids. SURFER: Yeah. -Hey, times are fully changing, brah. I mean, sooner or later, there won't be one lifer left out here. All knobs and gremmers and wannabes. -They heavily don't have any culture, brah. Don't they know nothing about ecology? -No fucking collective memory. I mean, where are their heroes? Ask them-- where are their Mike Randolphs? -Yeah. -Nick Rainwoods? -Yeah. -Bad Bruces. Even the Hojo-- -Hey, wait a minute. Nick Rainwood? Who's Nick Rainwood? -Nick Rainwood. Oh, come on. Heavily the best surfer this beach has ever seen. -Oh, come on, Rudder. Better than Jamming Jimmy? -The best surfer this beach has ever seen. -Well, how come I never heard of this guy before? -Are you ready for a righteous story? I mean, I'm talking 103 minutes with titles, OK? Are you with me? -I'm here, dude. -All right. Late '80s, man. -Yeah. -You remember how it was. -Oh, yeah. Whoa! [music playing] [music playing] SURFER 1: Now I'm talking So-Cal before the big one. Back when there was intelligent life on the other side of the hill. Back then, Nick Rainwood was one of gnarliest. And I use gnarly sparingly. He was one of the best surfers this side of the North Shore. MIDAS: Nick! [shouting] -Let's take them down. Totally essential to the sport. -Last time, Midas. -That ungratefull little shit's going to leave me alone to run the store. Blue. Drives the women nuts. -I told you to put up the "Help Wanted" sign. -Do you think this is about business, man? Hell, no. This wasn't about business. This was a relationship, man. We were talking relationship. $5.95. What are you going to do? You going to go to Stanford? What are they going to teach you? That's a good call, dude. You know, what are they going to teach you, huh? Art? Ceramics? Crocheting? -Liberal arts. -What's that, man? That's liberal shit, man. Stay on here. Hey, I mean it. I'll make you a fucking surfing guru. -Midas. MIDAS: What? All right. You want to make something of yourself? You and me, man. We'll take the money for your scholarship. We'll buy two one-ways. We'll live like kings on the North Shore. We'll surf the fricking 15 footers. We'll jump the local broads. We'll get crabs. We'll die young, huh? Take it easy. Come back. NICK: You think I can do it? -Do what, man? -Take the compo this year. Get enough money to stay and surf. Maybe draw a sponsorship. -What about school? -You just told me to forget about school. -I don't know. Compos are bad news. Board banging's not about the money. It's not about the women. It's not about the fighting. It's the moment, man. That's what it's about. -The moment? -Last lesson. There's a time, man, a moment. Maybe it's just a split second. Maybe it's an hour. But it's just you and the wave, man. It's just you and the wave. It's like-- it's like that. And there's nothing else. That's what it's about. It's not about the shit. It's not about the money. It's just the moment. -Yeah. I wish it was that simple. -Come here, man. Come here. Remember when you first started working here, I showed you this. You got all choked up? -Yeah. The stick from "Apocalypse Now." -It's one of five, man. It's one of only five. You know, I've never opened this case. Always wanted this stick to last. I've never taken it out. I've never even touched it. I want you have it, man. -Oh, no, no, no, no. -Hey, it's just dying in here. A stick was meant to be rode. Now would you get out of here before I give you my whole fucking shop? SURFER 1 (VOICEOVER): Now the whole thing broke over 72 hours, a weekend when everything seemed to hit the fan. A lot of the shit came from a raspy little beach house where Mrs. Yorpin and her two kids Allie and Reef lived. Now Mrs. Yorpin was fully spun. Kind of '60s, but cool for a mom. -Reef. SURFER 1 (VOICEOVER): Now Andy, Allie's and Reef's cousin, was this registered knob touristing from the farmland somewhere. Going to join the Navy. Be some kind of top gonad. -Reef. SURFER 1 (VOICEOVER): To the dudes, Reef Yorpin was one unpredictable mother. Serious about his sport. Had big ideas. I mean, a righteous rider. Plenty of style, but sketchy. Now if you ask the chicks, well, let me put it this way. They were just crawling out of the woodwork to wax his board. ALLIE: Joan. What are you doing? -I'm going to die. I swear. Allie. Your brother. He's a hunk. -That's what he tells me. JOAN: You know he called Jackson out. -How nice. -He had to go to the emergency room. 12 stitches. Do you think Reef would ask me to dance? I mean, of course, if I change my whole image. SURFER 1 (VOICEOVER): Now, Allie was a whole different wave from Reef. Fully smart, a rad artist. Not merched out, though, like some new Porsche asshole with a fucking beret. JOAN: Oh god, what if I ask him to dance and he laughed at me, or something? Allie. Help me? -All right You know what you need? The perfect song. -Dang. -Hey, I don't want to hear about it. Look, I've got a date with Brad tonight, so I want you to take Andy-- -Sorry, brah, I got a party myself tonight. -I'm not your brah, I'm your ma, and you are going to party with Andy tonight, understand? -Mom, the guys will have a total shit fit if they see me hanging out with-- -No arguments, OK? Just do it. -What, are you kidding me, Mom? Huh? Well, why can't Allie take care of Gomer? This is between my mom and me, all right. Huh? Could you get that, please? -Sure. -Reef! -What about Allie? -I want you to help out a little bit more around here. -Mom, the compo's tomorrow, man. I mean, like I got to soak up. -Andy can help you. Andy. Reef just invited you to a big party tonight. How does that sound? Go on. He'll cool off. LAPPS: Half an hour late, Rainwood. Thought you bailed on us. Most important weekend of the year, dude. -Hey, some of us do work for a living. -Hey, you know, I heard about that. Something the poor do. -Oh, man. Condition of this thing, man. You better keep that night job. -Hey. That's a Country Squire wagon, dude. Classic. -Hey, we can always take one of your cars. -Joking. Last time some dude totally thrashed my tires, man. -Hey, the turbo's out on the Porsche, bud. -Hey, you're breaking my heart. Yeah, was that it? Are you ready? -Am I ready? Are you ready? Are you brothers ready for a weekend of killer surf? -Oh, yeah. -Shit-faced drinking and non-stop fornication? -Yeah! -Do I hear an "amen?" -Amen. -Amen. -Do I hear an amen? -Amen! Amen! Amen! -Amen! -We're out of here. -Gentlemen, take a bow. -Oh, jeez. -Don't touch that. You're looking at the best god damn surfer in Southern California, bud. Me. After I win that $5,000 at the compo this Sunday, I'm turning pro. And I'm bailing this shit hole. See what these are? So many riders I've put in the E Room. Let me tell you how it is, bud. My friends are coming over here in a couple minutes. And they don't take the knobs the way I do. So you're just going to have to stay in the bathroom until they leave. Comprender? ALLIE: Ask him about surfing. Then you'll have him forever. JOAN: Jeez, don't you think I have enough to worry about? ALLIE: Just don't step on his feet. -Oh, it's nothing. You look great, too. -I just love this song. -Just don't push it. Let the guy say something first. -Well, what if he doesn't? -Oh, just be patient. Come on, Joan, don't be nervous. -It's just a surfboard. I'm already sweating. How do you like these? -No. -Why don't you go to the party tonight? I mean, you're great at this stuff. You know, I bet you get a guy just like that. -I don't want a guy just like that. -You Don't -No. -Well, what do you want? -I know what I don't want. -What? -Another surfer. -brah, you're taking this car stuff way too seriously. -Ah, ah, ah. Babes, port. -Oh, good from far but far from good. -Yeah. -Breaking up is hard to do, brah. -Yeah, well, I can't surf the rest of my life. -Why not? -Hey, I might be able to get you a job with my father. He's giving me 1,000 beaucoup bucks for every movie idea I come up with. -He, he. Thanks, Lapps. -You know, that's the perfect job for somebody who doesn't give a shit about the future, man. -Bullshit. I've seen "Star Wars" 10 times. Nick, I'm your father, Nick. -No, you see, Nick doesn't want to end up a losers like the rest of us, huh, Nicky buddy? -Hey, Marone, get off it, huh? -Huh, huh. Babes starboard. -Blondies. Blondie. -Blondie. Blondie, blondie. -Blondie, hey, whoa! -Hey cutie. -You just got to do what makes you feel good, bro. They drop the big one tomorrow, we don't got a future. -Yeah, well, ah, what if they don't drop the big one? -Party at the Lapps mansion. Yeah. -Whoa, whoa! -Once we get to the room. -Oh, please. -Tripper didn't call shit, man. -I did, too, man. -Will you shut the door? What do you mean, he didn't call shit, man? -Yeah, wait until he shows you. -It's more than you, you fucking zister. -Stop knobbing around. Say it. -Come on, man, show me something major. That's it. -I told you we'd hear it, man. -This is it. -Yeah. -Oh my god, wow. You're kidding me. I mean, brothers, this thing's fully bowed, man. I mean, what we talk about, right? You check your parent's dash midweek. You know, you don't come trucking to me with that little bind bag, all right? And you haired it, Backwash. I mean, come on. This salts me, man. But this-- this is what I'm talking about. -Ah, going out tonight, Andy? -Oh, oh. Hi, Allie. Um, oh, yeah, yeah, Reef's, um, Reef's going to take me to a beach party tonight. -Reef? -Uh-huh. Well, ah, I don't think he really wants to. [BOYS TALKING ON OTHER SIDE OF WALL] -Can you understand them? -Well, the animals are restless. -I take the wave really fine, right. This guy comes after me with a skag. -No. -So I roust him fully, right? He ends up in the E Room, man, selling Buicks of the lot, bro. -OK, um, this guy went after him with a knife, but he beat him up and the guy ended up in the emergency room with dry heaves. -Reef, brah. -What? I'm so fully amped. -Really excited. BACKWASH: Reef, let's book with the bud. -Leave quickly. -Chill out, Backwash. You'll probably get rousted by knobs, huh? -Relax. Do you want to get hassled by, in ah, knobs. -Book the cool with Tripper. -Um, we'll hide the pot with Tripper. BACKWASH: No, man. -Cool? -Pot. BACKWASH: Hey Reef, TLU going tonight? -Huh? -TLU. -Sexy girl, a tight little unit. -Her? Fuck her noise, man. She has guac in her pink box. They'll be a march before she party's, man. -They have guac, would march-- -Forget it. BACKWASH: What do you say we change the scenery, huh, brah? Hey, Tripper, the bag. Whoa. -They're booking. -Right. Wait, wasn't Reef taking you? -Hi, Allie. -Where's my brother, Backwash? -My father works in the missile silo. -Is Reef coming back? -He said I could bring anybody I want to see them. -I think I'd rather watch you, Andy, I'm sorry. -He's the one who's supposed to push the button. -Do you really want to go to this party? -Um, hey, look, don't worry about me. Just forget it, I mean, I'm fine. -No, you're going. Yeah, let me get dressed. [knock on door] SURFER 1: There was always this heavily amped-out party on the beach the night before the compo full of righteous dudes and knocked-out babes, bona fide board busters. Definitely worth a wheeze or two. -So why are you joining the navy? -Um, well, my brothers did, my Dad, it's sort of a family thing. You know. -But do you want to? -Well, yeah. Look, it's quick a tattoo. -How old you, anyway? -18. Well, in three weeks. -Move it, wimp. -Get out of the way, asshole. -What the hell? -I wouldn't stare too long. They're hostile to strangers. -Hey, have a beer. [singing] -Surfers for Christ. -You know, man, when I used to sit in the sand and envelope myself in the whole Pacific-ness, I could feel the wave crest psychedelically vibrate and cosmetically register with some kind of turbulence. That was the then-ness of it, but the force is flat because of the now-ness. -Ancients. Uh, they always talk like that. SURFER DUDE 3: But it's time for the new Gidget. -She got heavier, man. -Hey Reef. It's Reef. -Hi, Reef. -Who's that? -Oh, that's Gitch. -Gitch? -Yeah. I don't know her real name. That's what everybody calls her. -Hey Gitch, how about a-- -Get the fuck away from me, now. -Ha, ha. Oh. -Hot girl, hot fish. Gitch. So, ah, you want to dance? -Allie, you're here. What's going on? -Darn it, Joan, did you ask him? -I can't. Everything's going wrong tonight. -She didn't even talk to him. JOAN: Why are you telling her that? DONNA: Well, you didn't. JOAN: It's just that, I need the right-- -This is my cousin Andy. -Hi. -I swear I was going to. I swear I was. -Just ask him to dance. -Well, the music. It's got to be just right. -I'd dance with Tripper. -Big fucking deal, Donna. -All right, if I take care of the music, will you ask him? -She won't. -I will to. -No, you won't. You've been here all night, you haven't even talked to him. -I just haven't had the right moment. -Well, what's the big deal? -Nice to meet you. -I just-- -Who's that? -What's this Tripper bit, anyway? -Come on. You're going to go dance with him right now. -Meet me at the pier in two minutes. TRIPPER: Hey. Hey. All right, come on, set me up. Set me up. -Dude. -Man, there are a lot of knobs here, brah. -Hey, you listen to me? -[inaudible], right? OK. -Done, brah. -All right. Get out of here. -I'm looking for a song for Joan. -Nice. -Ladies and gentlemen, pick the blondie of your choice. -Hey, hey. -Allie. -Yeah? -Are they amping to be fully guacked? -Yeah. LAPPS: Hey, College boy. You're missing it, dude. -Yeah. ANDY: Allie, how about this? -Ah, yeah, yeah. ANDY: I'll put it on. [dance music playing] -I'll be right back. -Allie, should I play it? -He's a movie producer. Yeah. I can get you an interview with him, because, you know, he's my dad. He does lots of films-- I help him. -Let's samba. -Oh, no, I-- -Hey, whoa. -Ooh, sorry. -Hi. -Hi. -I saw you from over there. -Yeah. -You want to dance? -Sure. Yeah. -This is Cage Phillips. -Hi. -Well, ladies, what do you think? -Come on, why should we? We don't even know you guys. -Yeah, see, by you do. We're the guys you're going to party with tonight. -That's right. -Oh yeah? -Yeah. -Where? -Where? Where. -Yeah, where? -Uh, the penthouse. -The penthouse. -You guys have a penthouse? -We've got a penthouse. It's on the beach. It's got a real great view of the sunrise. -It's just like a movie. -Uh huh. -It's like you going off to the war, and I'm this nurse, and I say, "I'll wait for you, Tripper." But we know we'll never see each other ever again. [music stops abruptly] MAN: Hey, what are you doing? Get out of here! [jeers from crowd] Put on the music! -Were you at the Campo last year? -Yeah. Were you? -Yeah. And the year before that, and the year before that. -So you live around here? -Not-- not too far. You? -Not too far. -Tripper? -Yeah? -Are you sick? -Uh huh. -Tripper. Are you safe? -Yeah. They're in the pack. Where's the pack? Oh no. Reef is gonna kill me. -This is the line that connects you and I. -So your dad's a movie producer. What do you do? -Well, Dad pays me for my high concept ideas-- -Lapps. -I come up with these fantastic ideas-- -Lapps, Cage. Lapps-- blondie, please. -What? What? -Look at Nick, man. -So what? He's dancing. -Look who he's dancing with. -That's Yorpin's sister, man. MAN IN HELICOPTER: You are in violation of city and county law. -Get lost! MAN IN HELICOPTER: Fires are prohibited on the beach. Put out the fire and leave. We have weapons. -Reef. You got that pack, right? -What, man? -You came and got the pack, right? -Are you kidding me, man? I gave it to you, brah. Where is it? I said where is it, man? -There's so many knobs around here, I don't know where it is-- -Who's got it? -Who's got it? -There are so many-- -Who's got it? -Those Vals. They got it. -Dudes, hey. Hey. Bro, get on the other side of Nick and stand by. -Fast! -Right. -Yeah! -Come on, let's go, Lapps. -Where is it, asshole? -Hey, back off, man. -Don't, Reef. I mean it. -Shut up. Where is it? I said where is it, man? -Where's what? -The pack, man. -Pac-Man? Pac-Man! Wocka-wocka-wocka-wocka! -You guys think you can just cross the line like that? You're real funny, bunch of comedians, huh? -Hey we didn't do anything. -Why don't you get the fuck off our beach? -It's a free country, fuck face. -Fuck you! -Hey. Hey, it's a fight! Gang fight! MAN IN CIRCLE: We thank you for the sun you give us to dry our souls. And for that-- -You're kidding me. Bug off! -See that fight? -Yeah, man, but that ain't no big deal. You should have been down here the day that the Malibu Masochists took on 24 hoe-dads from El Monte. -He bit four guys' ears off! -That was a fight. It's a cub scout meeting over here. [police sirens] POLICEMAN: Move out! Hold it right there. Just shut up. All right, put him in the back. You got the right to remain silent-- -Just try it, punk! GIRL: You goddamn motherfucking anal-retentive bigots! When are you gearheads going to realize I wasn't in that fight? I wasn't in the fight. I really wasn't. Hey. Where's my stick? If there's on scratch on it, it's your life. You fascists. What are you staring at? -Nothing. -Then stop it. POLICEMAN: Do you hear me? You sit down there, miss. Come on. [phone ringing] [loud music playing] ANDY (VOICEOVER): Just because the cops bagged the fiesta didn't mean the party had to stop. Because whenever Allie's mom was out for a noche grande, Reef would open the house for some amped-out chaos. -96, 97, 98, 99, 100! -Where's Andy? Reef, where's Andy? -Shit, I don't know. He's probably sleeping in my room. -Oh, hi, Allie. -Hi. -You throw a great party. -I thought you locked the door. -So did I. But I guess not. -Why were you dancing with that guy? -None of your business. -Bullshit! First of all, he's Nick Rainwood, man. And second of all, he's a fucking Val. And he's the biggest asshole I've ever met in my life. -Wait a second. Who started that fight? -Yeah, who crashed the party and stole my pot? -Oh, and was that the pot you stole from Mom's drawer? -Yeah, what do you know, right? What I'm telling you is, you start pissing around with the Vals, don't expect us to wease in on it. Your little friends bail on you, what are you gonna do? Move to the fucking Valley? Huh? I'm telling you this shit because I'm your brother. -You sound more like my father. -Well the shit you putt, you need a father. -Fuck off. -No, you fuck off. All right, I'm sick and tired of you and Ma treating me like I'm some kind of fucking animal. -Don't touch me again. -Great party. -Where you going? Huh? Get the fuck out of here, man. Fuck you, man! -Hey, Skeeter. Skeeter, how you doing? What did they do to you? Hey, come on, let's go for a walk. NICK: I got your numbers. Um, I'm gonna be back in just a sec, OK? -'K. BLOND GIRL: You know, this is some beach penthouse. LAPP: It is. We have the ocean here. We've got some killer drinks-- NICK: I am coming back. I promise you. Dude. You are missing it, man. You've gotta check it out up there. We have scored big time. I'm not kidding you. So, what, are you you gonna leave Monday, or what? -Scholarship is use it or lose it. -Man, I don't understand you at all. You like the beach, right? You live to surf. You don't got beach and surf in college, do you? You've got books and teachers. That's a trade off you want to make? I don't think so. It's not going to be the same around here without you, bro. [laughter above] -Told you. -Hey Cage. That girl I was dancing with. What about her? -It's Reef's girlfriend? -No. -Are you sure? Because the way she was talking to him-- what? -That's his sister, man. -Oh, shit. -It's too bad, huh? -Too bad? -Too bad she's a Loc. -What do you think those are? -Oh, shit-- one boff, they're off, man. I saw the way you were looking at her. It was different. Locs and Vals don't mix. It's a waste of your time, man. It's not worth it, all right? It's screwed before you even get started. Come on. There's a girl up there that's got your name on her. Come on, guy. Dude. Come on. [classical music playing] SURFER 1: The next morning was fully check-it-out tasty, bro. The wind was low, surf was up, the knobs booked it to Disneyland. In a word, it was off the face. It was day one of the prelims, back when you had one chance to show your stuff. It was shred or be shredded, you know? Anyway, there were 30 minute heats, five of them, so only five riders tripped it to the finals. Say you drew and amped rider in your heat? You were fucked, right? Man, it didn't matter how much you'd partied, or how guaced your brain was, 'cause when the AM rolled around, whether or not you were selling Buicks by the pint, you'd be working greeners. SURFER 2: Hey brah, where'd you say the knobs went? SURFER 1: Knobs? They booked it to Disneyland. SURFER 2: Good place for 'em. SURFER 1: No shit. -Rise and shine, boys. Get up. Marone. Hey, dude. -Cage, let's get some donuts, man. Glazed, chocolate filled. What-- oh my god. Are they dead? -No. Cool. -I just had this dream that we were surfing, you know, all four of us. But surfing was like this thing that you do in a bowling alley. -Bowling alley? -Yeah. And there were all these lanes of waves and everything. And you had to rent them to use them, and we had to wear those shoes. And we were all wearing those bogus shirts, man, with like Gomez and Maynard. -Come on. -And dude. Dude, you were bald in my dream, man. You were the Kojak surfer in my dream, buddy. -Surf's that way, bud. -Yeah, thanks. -Surfing and bowling. Bowling. -Do you have my shoe? -Yeah. -Hey. We've got company. -Reef. Hey. Hey man. -What did you find out, bro? -You're in the third heat, us too. -It's a big ocean. -So anyone else? -Gitch in the fourth heat. -Gitch? From what I hear, brah, she's fully out of it, man. -I don't know. Why did the surf punk cross the road? -Because he was stapled to a chicken. -Hey Andy. Buddy. You gotta work on that laugh? Don't you have any jokes out there in the sticks? -No. -Well what do you do out there? You've got to do something for fun. -Yeah. There's cow-tipping. -Cow what? -Cow-tipping. I swear, you go out into the fields, where the cows are, where the cows are grazing-- -This better not be disgusting. -No. No no no. You go out there, you get about a dozen guys, and you push the cows over. They fall onto their backs, moo-- -Time for your wake-up call, gentlemen. -Shit! I gotta get going. Hey. Where's Trap? Are you deaf? -Yum yum. -I said, where's Trap? BUM: Good morning! -Who are you? Get out of my way. Oh, god. What are you, the sound man? Are you the sound man? Work with me. Did you go home fourth in this? BUM: Shakespeare said, all-- -You're going to attend? Good. What's your name, honey? Jenny. J-- -All right. Chicks, dudes, sand fleas. [jeers from crowd] Thank you so much. Your friend reported here, for the fourth annual-- [boos from crowd] MAN IN CROWD: Go home, shit head! -All right, that's enough. I'm a celebrity, damnit. Treat me like one! OK. Ha ha ha. -Well you're becoming a regular beach bunny. -Yeah. When did you get so interested in surfing? -Maybe she's interested in someone who's interested in surfing? Hmm? -Oh, no. She's sick of surfers. -Oh, really? -Uh huh. Good morning to you, too. ANNOUNCER: We're ready to begin the first heat. -Where's a tidal wave when you really want one? All right, my people. I love you, I love you all. So, will the contestants please proceed to the starting line now. [burp] -OK, guys. 15 seconds. ANNOUNCER: In our first heat, we have McDonald in blue, Leghorn in yellow, Rainwood in orange, Carroll in black, and Stevens in gray. What a colorful group, huh? -Come on. [horn sounds] [MUSIC -- THE SWEET, "BALLROOM BLITZ"] -That's my buddy. -Wow! Man, did you see that? Did you see that guy wipe out? Wow. -Man, that's nothing, man. I hit the pier so hard once it took me five years to get the barnacles out of my teeth. That was a wipeout. [horn sounds] ANNOUNCER: Unofficially, Rainwood has the points standing in the first heat. Hey, let's hear it for him, everybody. -All right. All right, man, you're OK. -Good one. All right. -Hey, Marone. -Hey, nice wave, man. You got lucky. -Lucky? Man, you know I'm always in control. -You had to be to give me some competition tomorrow. -Just rip it up today. -Top dog. ANNOUNCER: The judging is now complete. Rainwood places first, Carroll second, and Stevens third. That moves Rainwood to the finals, ladies and gentlemen. He's our first contestant in the finals. Heat number two will be in three minutes. -Hello, Nick. -Hey. -Hi, I'm Hap Jordan. -Hap Jordan, yeah. '67 through '71, West Coast champ. Took Australia in '72. -Ancient history. Now I'm resident of Ocean Floor Beachwear. You did some really insane surfing out there. Totally impressive. -Thank you. -You know, I'd be very interested in your reaction to me new clothing line. You wear like, a large shirt, right? -Right. -Waist 32, 33? -30. -Got a favorite color? -Yeah, red. Have fun with these. I think it'd be a great look for you. In fact, why don't you try them out tonight at the ocean four party? You'll be there, right? -Yeah, well-- -My number's in this bag. I'm very interested in what you think, Nick. I'll, uh, see you tonight, huh? -Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Jordan. -Likewise. GITCH: Hey, it's about time. I'm really getting fed up with this. -You should have thought of that before you slung at Henderson. -The guys' a Dick. -The man is a police officer. -That's what I said. [laughing] [snorting] -You will apologize to Henderson, and I'll consider dropping the charges. -My friend too? [indistinct speech] -Hey. -Great car. -Yeah. I've outgrown it. -No, I like it. It's sort of, um-- -Valish. -Yeah. Yeah. Well, you've got enough boards? -Well, I work in a surf shop. And, uh, each board does have a purpose. That one's for one. The one inside the compo, that's for the money. And the third one, a friend gave me. You surf? -No. I hate it. Sort of. -What? Sort of, or really? -Really. Um, it's like hating David Letterman, or tennis shoes with Velcro, or floppy disks, or-- or plastic watches. -Generic food? -Love it. -Creamed corn? [both laughing] -Or paintings of clowns? -No, Elvis. Black velvet Elvis paintings. --[laughs] Elvis, the Vegas years. -Yeah.

So that's what you do? You paint? -Yeah. Well, I mean, it's what I want to do. -You don't call that doing it? -Well, here, it gets painted over with graffiti. -So, Paris. -Maybe someday. -It's tough to leave, isn't it? But you've got to give it a try. You gotta give it a shot. Allie, I'm leaving this week. School's starting up at Stanford. -Oh. That's great. Congratulations. -Yeah? -Well, we don't have a lot of time then. -No, we don't. Do we? -Uh-uh. -Well, then let's go. -OK. [laughs] Which way? BOY: I don't know. ALLIE: OK. [crowd chatter] -Yeah, thanks. They charge a dick. -They don't want my dick, bro. [both laughing] -Cool, man. -No one was even close, bro. -Unbelievable. I owe you one, bro. -Reef, man. That-- that was the hottest wave, brah, air. -The Val. E-room, brah. E-room. Get the board. -All right get the T -What does this make? Makes 12 Vals. -There's your six pack. MAN (OVER SPEAKER): Only two minutes into the fourth, and already, the only chick out there has taken command. -The only chick, bro? MAN (OVER SPEAKER): Oh, lovely. Gitch Anderson, ladies and gentlemen. -Go Gitch. She's got it. Go. Oh, faster. Keep going. Keep going. Go. Go. Go. Faster. Yes.

What's the shit you pulled with Marone, huh? -He was in the way, man. What do you expect? -You're a fucking liar. He didn't get in the way. It was totally his way. -I said he was in the way, man. -Motherfucker. -Hey. -Relax, man. MAN:Yo, check that shit out over there. -You gearheads want to finish this? -Fucking right, we do, man. -Cool. How about the garage tonight behind the surf club, huh? -We're there. -Yeah.

We're in the finals together. -Hey. Yeah, good luck to you. GITCH: Yeah, you think you're hot. Good luck. -Hey, bro. -Brah. Brah. -Right, right, right. -[screaming] [applause] [breaking glass] [cheering, shouting] -Well, I could use something cold. -I'll go. -Me too. -Uh, hey, And? Get me one of those lights, huh? -Hey. [clicks tongue] You're fine. -I love it when he does that. -So, how did you and Andy meet? -Oh, I met him this morning in jail. -Oh. -Look, I'm gonna go sit down. -Gitch is nice. -Yeah, she's a good slut. -A what? -Oh, wait. Maybe I have that wrong. Slut's a girl who's a friend, right? -Yeah, but you don't use it like that. -Right. -You surf? -No, but I'd like to. -So? -Well, uh, I don't have a lot of time. I'm joining the navy soon. -Yeah? How old are you? -18. Like, in three weeks. -MAN: All right. -Joan, hi. Did you-- -Haven't you-- -No, you go ahead. -Have you seen Reef? -No. Did you see Chipper? [laughing] -Well, I guess it's request time. [applause] --[laughing] This is for Reef Yorpin. Hey, the customer's always right. Hit it. [crowd chattering] [music playing] [band singing] [crowd chattering] MAN: What is this? -OK. Come on. Let's go look for him. -(SINGING) And we'll have everything. [crowd shouting] -[shouting] [playing guitars] [shouting, chanting] [screaming] -Listen, would you excuse me? Thanks. Hey, Nick. -Hey. -I'm really glad to see you. You've got great timing. What's your friend's name? -Uh, Andy. -Andy. Would you honor an ancient and give me about 47 seconds with our friend here? -Hey, no problem. Hey, catch you on the turn around. [laughing] -I'm so glad you made it. I want you to have a good time tonight. You deserve it. -Yo, hey. How you doing? Can I have a drink? You like to dance? Yeah. Excuse me, sir, are you deaf? -So, uh-- -What? -You couldn't get the pins out of the new shirts? You didn't like the threads? -Ha ha. No, they're fine. -Well? -I don't know. I'm wearing these tonight. [chuckles] -Hey, Nick. See that kid down there? -Where? -The one in the red shirt? NICK: Yeah. -He needs excitement. That's what he's looking for. Look at him. And he wants acceptance. Look around. That's what they all want. Acceptance. He wants to be Nick. I mean, he can't. He can do the next best thing. He can dress like you. -So this actual live footage of Okinawa. No shit, right? Are you with me? This is historical. Because the destruction of these things, you know, because not many people have actually seen a megaton warhead. -So, what do you say? You'll wear the clothes, right? -I'll think about it. -OK. Well, think about this. $30,000 a year for as long as you surf and win. If you win tomorrow, Nick, that'll be-- Right. Anyway, listen. You have a great time tonight. I'm glad you came. I'm counting on you, Nick. -All right. -I think you're a winner. -Good night. [shouting, cheering] [shouting] -We're not going. He's here. -I know he's here. Let's just shine both of them. Let's buck. -Don't be a shit. -Oh, forget it. -Hey, bro. -Hey, guys. You notice anything different? -Put it on my dad's Visa. -Man, what the hell happened? -What else? -Yeah. We thought maybe you left for college a little early. Huh? -Are you sure you don't want to dance. No. Thank you. -Well, you danced with Val. What? Now. -Thank you. -No problem. So, whose side are you on? -In what? -You're Reef's sister, right? And that's Nick Rainwood you're with. -What? -The fight. -If you can manage to drop your low wench, meet us in the garage, dude. [music playing] [breaking glass] -All right. Let's go. Come on. -Man, we don't need that school boy tonight. We could take him, man. -Hey. All right. -Yeah. -Yay. -I knew you'd make it, bro. -No. I didn't come here to fight. -You're here, right? -Yeah, but I came here to get you guys, not to fight. [tires screeching] -Come on. -Come on, man. We're ready. -Valley boys. I see that you made it. Heh. You guys ready to settle this, or what? -We're here to beat the shit out of some blokes. -Well, I'm ready for you, man. Right here, bro. CAGE: Come on-- -Cage, don't. I'm telling you, this is stupid. -You want out, you're out, OK? Is something wrong? -Cage, it doesn't stop here. So you hurt these guys, then what? MAN: You're the one that's going to be hurting asshole. -Look at what they did to Marone, huh? -Oh yeah. This is going to change things. -Oh, what are you kidding here, man? What, do we got fucking Gandhi here, man? -Don't you touch me. -Hey, watch it, man. Give it to him. -Yeah, man. Come on, man. Give it to them. [grunting, slapping] -Watch it. [grunting] -Time for a new asshole, Rainwood? [grunting] [grunting] [grunting, slapping] [pounding] [grunting, slapping] [gasping] [grunting] -Nick? [grunting] ALLIE: Nick. (SCREAMING) Nick. -[grunting] -Lay off her, Val! [clanging, grunting] [coughing] [panting] [panting] [car starting] [tires screeching] -Come on, you fuckers. [tires screeching] [crash] [grunting] [sirens] -Come on, Reef. -Come on, Cage. -All right. -Come on, damn it. -Go. Shit. -Come on. Get up, over here. -Woo. MAN: Backwash. Nick? [sirens] MAN: Backwash. MAN: Go, go, go. [sirens] -Gitch. [music playing] -That's Mr. Ed. A lot of water, and that's just what's on top. The truth-- Mr. Ed knows the truth. And you know the thing about it is that truth has a healing effect, even when it's not fully understood. -I'm being remarkably good about this. Most moms would-- well, we won't talk about what most moms would do, huh? What's wrong? -Nothing. -Nothing? Reef comes in, covered with blood, and he says nothing. Great communication in this family. Some guy, huh? Listen to your mother-- forget about him. Hey, last night Brad told me he's going back to his wife. -Oh, I'm sorry. -Oh, don't be. Anyway, do I look any worse for it? No. And what am I going to do? I'm going to go out and I'm going to have a good time, and so are you. So, come on. -I'm leaving, you know? -I know, honey. -No, I mean it. -I always knew it'd be you before Reef. So come on to the beach with your old mom. I feel silly going alone. Put that cute little green suit on and let's go have some fun. Come on! -Bon appetit, young lady. -Maybe you shouldn't have punched out those officers. I-- -You were about to get the shit kicked out of you. -Well, that's their job. -Well, next time I won't. Hello! I got to get out of here! Will somebody get me out of here? -I lost a pool because of you. Eh, we timed it-- less than 24 hours between arrests. -You shouldn't be betting anyway. -My bet was for less than 12. -I'm sorry. You're going to need a lawyer on this one. -Please, please-- -Please? -No. -Just this once? -No. -I won't ever do it again. I, I promise. -No. -Please, daddy? [toilet flushes] -Clothes make the man. NARRATOR: They say God bailed on Sunday. Ha, maybe-- but on that Sunday, God was shredding overtime. From Zuma to New Porsche, hell, no local had seen a swell like this before. And this was no merch-soaked Cal bow breaker. This was a royal space time fuck up. This was every gastro loc's wet dream. I mean, some guys were praying for glass, some guys hollowness, some guys speed, even power. And that day, God listened to all their prayers. -You got to answer for it, Rainwood. There's no clean slate in the morning, Bro. We pick up when we left off. You got a fucking problem with that, man? Huh? -What, you didn't get enough last night? -I say, you got a problem man? You got a fucking problem, man, huh? Come on! -I got a fucking problem, man! -Hey, bro, it's fucking one-on-one, man, huh? That's why these guys are here to make sure. -Well, my problem, you see man, is, I don't fight exactly fair. I'm working on that. I'm really working on that. Until I beat it, this ain't going to be a fair fight. -Let's go, man. There's no protection in the water, man. -Come on, Reef. -There's protection everywhere. LAUGHS -That's good. What the hell? Did you start World War III up here, or what? -What? What are you doing here? -I cam to get my picture taken with the hot straps of '68. Shit! Do you give a damn, or what? -Yeah. Yeah, I give a damn, man. I'm glad. -I don't want to hurt your feelings or anything, but what the fuck are you wearing? -Hey, Andy? Have you seen Allie? -Uh, not since last night. -Hey, Nick, remember when we were talking about me surfing? I was wondering if, uh-- -Uh, Nick? ---maybe you want to go out-- -Nick! ---and show me some more. -Hey, Nick. Hello! Good to see you. We should talk. Uh, sorry to interrupt. Nice to see you again. Look, I know you got to rush. But I just want to let you know that I met with my team this morning. You know, I show them your look-- very excited, very positive. They loved it. The bottom line, we need an ocean floor figurehead. Someone we can count on. Someone like you, Nick. So, hey, I'm not just talking about three measly years here, buddy. I'm talking about something that you can count on for life. We need you, Nick. We think you're what's happening today. Your talent and our marketing concept, we could make you a star. You'll be set for life. What do you think? It's great, huh? Now, all you need to do is go out there today and win. We can talk about the digits later. Hey, frankly, Nick, there's no one out there who can touch you. Go get 'em. -Thanks. -It's all yours. -Would the five finalists please make their way to the starting line for today's main event? -Come on! Let's go! Come on, let's go! -Allie! -No, Nick. -What do you mean, no? -I mean I don't want to talk about it. -Allie, what you saw last night, it's not what you think. -I don't want to hear it! -This guy's still missing. -We can't wait long. We give him one more minute, then we go. -It's over? Why? -Because we're different. Because I thought you were different than some of jerks around here. I thought you were smarter, but you're not. You're from the other side of the hill, but you're just the same. [starting horn] [applause] -Because I own a surfboard? -No. There's nothing wrong with surfing. It's the constant fighting between you and Reef that makes no sense. Surf all your life! Just don't be a surfer all your life. -Hey, Nick! You're throwing away a lot more than this content, Rainwood. Don't do it! -Nick! Come on, bro! -Nick, what the hell you doing? -Come on, Nick! Do it! -Come on, man! ANNOUNCER: And Blue is the first to take a chance with Mother Nature. -Come on, man! -Good luck. -Let's do it already. -That's more like it. All right, Nick. Good man. -Give him a chance, OK? -I'll give him a chance. Easy, babe. -That's our guy! ANNOUNCER: Rainwood has finally decided to join us. -Yeah! -Woo! -Right on, man! -Off the top! Oh! Woo! [applause] -Yeah! [cheers] ANNOUNCER: Rainwood's delayed start has cost him valuable points. -Come on, bro! Give it to 'em, bro! ANNOUNCER: Well, it's about time. Rainwood has finally chosen his first wave. [applause] -Yeah! -Yeah! Woo! [cheers] ANNOUNCER: Oh, gee. From the look of the judging, whoever gets this last wave may go home $5,000 richer. It is that close. -Just you and me out here, asshole! -Hey, back off! -No more backing off, bud. No more. -Man, what is your problem? When are you going to learn? What do you want? -I want your balls, bro-- or does my sister already have them, huh? [horn blares] ANNOUNCER: The horn has sounded for the last ride. -Yeah, why don't you come and get them? -Let's go! -Come on, Nick! ANNOUNCER: From my viewpoint, it's anyone's race. NARRATOR: Reef on the inside, trying to keep Nick out, and Nick sticking in like a shadow. But it wasn't just a battle of strength. There was a lot more at stake, and nobody knew that better than Nick. So right when they were on top of the lip, right when you tuck your balls and hold your breath, Nick made his last move-- he turned it south. [shouts] -You son of a gun. -That guy's a loser. -I would have fucked him up, man. -I'd have buried the fucker. -Hey, hold your rasping until I'm finished. NARRATOR: Like I said, Nick's mind was set. It didn't matter that Reef had the wave, or that Nick looked like a weez-- not to him. You see, something had clicked inside telling Nick it was the right move. -The last lesson took. NARRATOR: Now, Reef didn't care how he got that wave. He just knew he was on his way to the bank. [cheers] -Go, Gitch! Go! Go! Go! NARRATOR: Let me tell you, Gitch was pulling one great ride. -You said she was out of it. -She's not out of it, obviously. ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, please join me in the judging area for the presentation of today's trophies and prizes. -Gitch, can I get a picture here? Guys, picture here? [cheers] -I guess I lost. -No, you didn't. -What a wuss. I still can't believe him. -Hey, man, take it easy on him. He's going to be OK, bro. He knows what he wants. -Want to go watch big Wednesday? -Hey wait, you guys. Wa-- how are we getting home? ANNOUNCER: Hey, here's our champion. Yeah! Gitch! Hey, let's get her up here. All right! -As long as you did what you had to, man, I got no questions. -Thanks, Midas. -Thank god for a little [inaudible] in the sun. -Midas? -Yo? -Thanks. [cheers] -Andy! Andy! -Oh, hey Nick. Sorry about the competition. -No problem. Hey, take this. Learn to surf. -What? No, no, I can't take this. -Andy! Take care of it. It's important. -Thanks a lot! ANNOUNCER: --Gitch Anderson. Let's give her a hand! -All right, Gitch! ANNOUNCER: Oh, you can do better than that! Come on! She challenged the rules and she did it! Let's give her a hand! Yeah! -Don't say it. -I'm not going to say anything. Hey, it's cool. -What the hell are you laughing at, man? -Uh, you got beat by a girl, man. Hey! I'm just fucking around, Reef! It's cool. I'm sorry. -What are you laughing at? -Can't help it. -Thanks. -Gitch? Insane surfing. Totally impressive. -Fuck off! Come on. -I know, I know-- the sun's up here, but it's nighttime in Europe. -There's no rest for no one. [starts singing "amazing grace"] -Well. -Well. -I, uh, I can't stay. I gotta go. -I know. I can't stay, either. -Which way you going? -Which way you going? -[inaudible]. -Yeah. -What a weez! -Oh, like I believe that. -Hey, bro, it's true. -You know what I think, bro? I think you got about an OZ approval on a brain, dude. What about it, dudes? -Come on. Way, bro. -Hey, hey, where you going, bro? Hey, bro? Hey, bro, later days, man. [laughs] -See ya later, geeks. -Hey man, what a, what's a geek? [MUSIC - THE DRIFTERS, "UNDER THE BOARDWALK"] -Papa! Hi! -Look, there's daddy. -There's daddy! Daddy! Hi, daddy! [laughs] [snorts] [music - "under the boardwalk"]
