Upwards, greet the big man OK - The kofta - Coming, coming, you monster First Degree Court Morning, Mr. Fathi Is the destruction of human relations required? Are we to change people to inanimate objects Your Honour, the Egyptian family depends on close social - and traditional relations.. Please, stick to the core of the problem - What's up? - A new judge and as you see, none of us can talk sense in front of him Your Honour, the truth is - that there is no case because the accusation we face is - that this man tried to kiss this girl in public, that is to say in the street and this is exactly what happened This man is the uncle of this girl.. Her uncle, the brother of her mother! He was working in Saudi Arabia as a math teacher She had not seen him for 4 years, so when they met the warm family relations made her run up to him and scream : "How are you, uncle! I miss you, uncle" "My niece, how have you grown up" and he kissed her on her cheek The emotion and love of a father and daughter And here, your Honour, is an official certificate proving - that my client is the uncle of the girl - and here also is another document stating that - they met on the second day of his homecoming Hence your Honour I plead innocence from the accusation - of an indecent act performed in public A fine of five hundred pounds - But he's her uncle, your Honour - He did kiss her, didn't he? He kissed her but he's her uncle But the passers-by in the street don't know that he's her uncle They saw a man kissing a woman in public, an indecent act.. next on the roll The judge is very strict and I'm scared Your case is number 36, still a lot of time, I promised you acquittal, I'll get it No, wait, say something If I defend you, you will get the most cruel sentence I'm out for a while Haven't you seen Mr. Aly El Zanati? Hello, Aly Hello, Fathi - Do you have a case here? - No So what are you doing? Listening to the trials Come, I need you - Me, defend a slut? - She is not a slut and the accusation hasn't been proven - Even so - And so what if she's a slut? How does she differ from the drug dealers, thieves and killers you're always defending? - Why don't you defend her? - The judge won't like my looks but when he sees you, he'll feel at ease, and will listen to you. I'm sure of what I say OK, for the friendship and the old times between us Give me a quick idea about the case The girl was caught with a guy in bed What are you listening for? - Well? - I'll tell you, come All ye o faithful, if you are approached by an infidel with news, check it out less you harm people through ignorance - and become regretful of what you have done Thus in truth, spoke God the Great Your Honour, and before we delve into details, we have two motives, and we want after praying to our Prophet, to prove them because - they are the proof of innocence by the will of God The first plea is the invalidity and incorrectness of searching and arrest due to the lack of a court order - from the Prosecutor General to do so, and the lack of apprehension during the act The second plea is the lack of presence of a crime, such a crime presupposed being a habitual one- and that it is committed in exchange for a fee, in accordance to what is stated in the penal code Your Honour, the documents in front of you lack - the apprehension of any proof or currencies with - the defendant at the moment of arrest The big boss is waiting personally for you outside And the incident, is a trivial, unnecessary matter, mainly that the officer who arrested her wanted to present his services to her, but she refused to be led by this demonic lust, hence, her arrest was a form of revenge and punishment We seek the justice of the court, and the ruling of the innocence of the defendant I thank your Honour Innocent Next case This is a noted day in the history of the entire governorate A VIP honoured it with this visit today You two-piece joker Get in, Fathi, get in - How can I open it? -Get in Are you aware, you little rebel, that I was offered the post of governor here and I refused? We lost and you won, Mr. Shawkat We lost an honourable governor and you won peace of mind Did you ask Farouk about my share in the case I sent you? -Yes - A million pounds My share in the case is a million pounds So I wasn't mistaken to ask for ten, one hundredth And you'll get the ten thousand pounds now Give them to him, Farouk And you'll receive twenty percent if we get off innocent That is two hundred thousand pounds Give him the case, Farouk Farouk, wait, did you get the stuff? OK, take these with you Does the suitcase hold any thing beside the case, the money, and the you-know-what? Give me the suitcase because this is an important case The prosecutor has turned the case over to the court, and it has no loopholes the defense can escape through That's your game The defendants are all public and important figures - and a ruling of innocence will save many VIPs Every bolt has its screwdriver Would you like to stay in a hotel - so as to concentrate your efforts on studying the case? It isn't worth it Tell us where you're going. We'll drop you off It wouldn't work, Mr. Shawkat Where I'm going, if a car like this enters, a revolution would erupt Goodbye Goodbye Place for one for Zambeel Al Gabal How are you, Om Saad? Who is it, Fatheya? It's our glowing youth Fathi, son of Nofal May he rot in hell, coming to visit his mother and father empty handed Shit! Who on earth is knocking! See who it is, boy Why are you in such a hurry? - How are you, Mansour? - How are you, Mr. Fathi? - How are you doing, father? - How are you doing, son? Didn't I ask you to forget about this job? This is the job that feeds us, while you've forgotten us And besides, what's wrong with this job? Didn't it make you an effendi and a bey? Where's my mother? Your mother's gone to offer condolences to Al Senousi - He died this morning - This is one God-damned day She too doesn't want to stop working Let's go, mother Never think I'm an ingrate, or ignorant of what you have done for me Father, starting today you'll stop weaving these mats - and mother won't be a professional mourner Starting today, it's a new world Take, pa These are ten thousand pounds, the first ever decent sum I have earned I want you to buy land, I want you to be a land owner I'll send you more money so you can buy more, and when you've reached an agreement, send for me so I can write the contracts myself Hold on, mom, there's mourning in a house nearby Fathi, Fathi - Have you been waiting long? - Where have you been? I was visiting my parents I was disturbed when I couldn't find you after the court ruling - of innocence for your client Why don't you keep this classical Arabic for the court, speak simple, we're at a sidewalk cafe People say "good evening" You've come to take your fee, isn't that so? No, no, I've come to discuss other grand plans That's fine, but each receives his due share I cede all my share in today's trial No, no, by justice, each takes 50% but it is I who cede my share You cede, I don't. Let's go up because I need to go to the loo Our bill, brother Sometimes, going to the loo is better than the bridal suite - Isn't this enough? - What do you mean? - The chaos you're living in - Don't worry yourself, Aly What's the important business you wanted me for? - I want you with us - With you where? - In Cairo - Do what in Cairo? To have an office there Why don't you look at yourself, Aly? I'm okay, I have an office there and now it's at the stage of preparation Now you'll also tell me the cases are good and ready This is true And who is this who hands out bureaux for lawyers with ready court cases? This question comes ahead of its time This will be in exchange for what? Nothing.. In exchange for nothing Zanati, there is nothing made for nothing in exchange Mention this thing so we can determine if it's worth it or not Answer the phone This isn't a phone, it's the door bell My, did you finish with all the procedures so quickly? Your money butters your way out Greet Mr. Zanati the lawyer, who got you off the hook May God help you always and elevate you higher and higher What's going on? I beseech you, God! You see, our lawyer here doesn't like kissing - What does he like then? - He doesn't like anything May God protect me - Go on, sit and eat - I'm full of joy, sir There are things that need to be washed, wash them while I tend to business with our lawyer Come and eat, Aly Are you crazy, I eat from the sweat of sluts? You see, this kebab is in fact my payment, and you asked for 50% of it, at your own will May God protect me She isn't a slut, the court found her innocent The sentence is still hot, just like this kebab, come on, eat Eat what? Come on, eat, you've already eaten many times before Your main job will be the defense of callers of the faith That is of course in addition to the normal cases Will there be payment? Or will the cost of the bureau be paid back in court cases? The bureau is a gift A gift? No one accepts a gift without knowing its source A clean and honest source, donations from religious and pious people. Funds from Al Zakah, support from countries concerned about Islam And since when are the funds of poor Muslims - used to finance bureaux for lawyers? Don't give me a headache Calculate how many years have passed since our graduation What have we accomplished? Don't think we're real lawyers, we work for crumbs Those who write out applications earn more than you or I What do we do? Some beating, a stolen goat, a squabble over a milling wheel? If you get the chance to be something - never for a moment turn it down - The matter is... - Interest... Where is your interest? I love this frankness very much, Aly Why did you choose me? Did I ask why you chose me to defend - that girl washing your clothes in the bathroom? I chose you because I correctly read the judge All he lacked was a beard I thought I'd get him one of his own team Great, many judges don't like the likes of us in court So you work with your team So I'll be without a beard Just join us, with or without a beard. What do you think? Shall we read the Fatihah in confirmation? This opportunity seems out of size for me - because opportunities are like shoes They're either too tight so you limp - or too wide and you end up shuffling Yes, but you are turning your back to a sound and solid future Your opportunity has no future Aly, you'll take fame and fortune but never forget you'll be against the government And why not say one of the revolutionaries What revolutionaries? Are you kidding? You just said the matter was that of interests It seems you enjoy defending widows, divorced women - and.. girls of ill fame I'm like you in a way, waiting for an opportunity, but one that fits me, and it'll come Here, Aly Don't say you've stopped playing I'd really be disappointed Take it, Aly Ya wash ya wash, Aly Yawash yawash, o swing Don't upset it, o swing Alley alley cop Fathi Nofal - The Lawyer Samira I put the tea kettle on the stove - Isn't there any food? - You know better Rats would desert this house You know how to read, right?

The private sector, in a shop, a company, a factory And work for what? Sixty pounds? The boss squeezes you, and gets what he wants So why not free lance better? How much do you earn working free? A thousand pounds, a bit higher, a bit lower, it depends Isn't that a low price for selling - oneself the whole month? It's not exactly every day, I'd be working on and off - On and off? -Yes What do you say to working for me - instead of this free work of yours? - Work as what? - Everything - How much will you pay? - Three hundred pounds I'll be washing and cooking and cleaning, making tea, changing the bed sheets every day In addition to office work And that too?

The case has five loopholes, sir, three that blow it sky-high, and the remaining two lift up the debris Oh my God, you see through your cases in a very strange way To wrench out the loopholes- it was necessary to squeeze them out, sir These are the loopholes, sir These are the loopholes of the case that aroused - public attention? It's all up to you, sir I'll have to excuse myself now - and I'll await Farouk and the rest of my fee - Are you that sure? - Days are close Why don't you spend the night?

Half a million pounds You're ensuring yourself, brushing away a powerful opponent - and overcoming those enemies who already have - the knife over your neck I'll consider it a gamble of sorts God will help us succeed, Pasha And if they meet the faithful, they proclaim their faith, and if they are alone with their demons, they say we are with you, we are ridiculing God ridicules them and furthers - their despotism to blindness.

You'll get what you want Yes, but I've left the law business since ages, now I simply tend to book and registers No, this has nothing to do with book tending, it has something to do with elections Don't tell me you're planning to campaign? Not me, Rushdi El Khayal is running in my hometown and I'm handling his election campaign - What do you need of me? - I need your expertise You were always a whiz kid as far as elections were concerned and were the best one to say slogans, you're a revolutionary And is this Rushdi El Khayal revolutionary? That is not our concern, this is work Must we do anything for anyone as long as he pays? - This is how the country goes - No, no, seek someone else All what is needed are some fiery slogans to be written - on signs of cloth.. that's it What signs do you speak of? You want naked people to stare at unreachable signs of cloth? - I'll pay you 10,000 pounds - Save them I believe very much in my slogans, and will never sell them or use them for a policy I do not believe in Aren't you aware of what's going on around you?

He is being interviewed by television "Opinion Forum" or "Speech of the Soul"? Not Egyptian television, it's the BBC - Where? - The BBC On the BBC In answering your question, dear sister, we condemn violence - and terrorism. and the Islamic movement in Egypt - has legitimate demands, seeks to realize them, and he will, God's willing Our first demand is the rule with God's book - and the teaching of his prophet Mohamed But you use violence to realize these goals In fact, it is the government who always initiates- the circle of violence, and some brothers see, and they might be right, that this is a matter of Jihad, the duty of every muslim Doesn't it pain you, the bloodshed between people of the same nation and the same faith? O sister, a Jihad in the name of God must have some victims, and bloodshed is bound to occur, and this has been recorded throughout history Martyrs will enter paradise Mr. Aly, by your calculations, how strong is the Islamic movement in Egypt? God bless them, are you casting an evil eye? Anyway, they are in constant increase thanks be to God The Islamists have in fact reached rule - in Afghanistan, but now they are in bloody conflict Could this be the case if they took power? I believe it will be different as the disharmony - between brethren can be brought under control By the way, the government is very clever - it leaves you to speak as you want, granting interviews inside and outside It has left you all the mosques, all this to prove it is a democratic government And we are very pleased with this democracy Of course you are pleased The government wants to create a reputation, and no one believes it, while you gain new ground daily Your presence is clear and felt Something of a fait-accompli Fathi, your future is with us Everything in due time, no one knows what the coming days hold for us Aly, if my future really worries you, I need your help You know I can never delay anything you ask for, as long as it is within my reach Rushdi El Khayal is running in our constituency against - Abd El Hamid El Seyoufi, and we need your help We need the votes of your brethren - For which one? - For Rushdi El Khayal Rushdi El Khayal? He is a corrupt man And what but a corrupt man do you need? You prosper on corruption And what do we get in exchange? If you want money, we'll pay No, no money, we have more than you can imagine So, what are your demands? We will consider it a compliment, on condition that it be returned if ever - we need the reciprocation You do, as a matter of fact, have bundles of money It is Rushdi El Khayal, the revolutionary man It is he who refuses the squandering of funds unnecessarily Rushdi is not in need of slogans on signs of cloth, but rather the cloth is needed for your sons - and daughters for a better and brighter future Go all of you, take the cloth Rushdi, Rushdi, Ooh, Ooh What does "Ooh Ooh" mean, Fathi? It's the new national and popular cry, we must keep up with times May God keep you and save you on Earth and in Heaven - Kiss him - What? He's got scabies Kiss him on the mouth Long live Rushdi El Khayal, hero of the poor and scabied Long live Rushdi El Khayal, hero of the poor and scabied Long live the scabied Long live the scabied May God never shame you He's wet Rushdi El Khayal, hero of the wet ones Rushdi El Khayal, hero of dehydration Rushdi El Khayal, hero of the wet ones Good evening, sir I hope you're pleased with us Officer of the security service, Kamal Abul Oan - Do you order anything? - I want to talk to you Can we talk alone in a secluded place?

I have no vote in this constituency You know I'm not from these whereabouts You know that the government's nominee must win If the government wants him to win I love your openness, sir, and this is why - I also will be open with you. I want to strike a deal with you I know you're a lawyer but you must know - you are talking to an officer of the security service - The bargain is legal - If it's legal we can talk I want to strike Abd El Hamid El Seyoufi in his birth place I want all the votes to go to Rushdi El Khayal - That's impossible - Quite, to the contrary if you listen to me, it will be quite easy The Gharabawy family is one of the biggest in town Tewfik El Gharabawy as you well know, is a drug dealer I want you to arrest him two days before the elections If you weren't a lawyer Is arresting people that simple? Where is the permission of the prosecutor? - Caught red-handed - What? - Red-handed - And then? What will the Gharabawy family do? They will go to their friend, Abd El Hamid El Seyoufi They will ask him to interfere and he will in fact interfere - And then what? - He'll come to you, ignore him Then Rushdi Ell Khayal will come, and to him I give all my attention, and release Tewfik El Gharabawy Of course, because our slogan is "Deeds not Words" Rushdi El Khayal, a landslide victory Fathi, you removed the knife from over my neck before - I was slaughtered, you will by force remain with me always Wait.. Fathi, Fathi, Ooh Ooh Fathi Fathi, Ooh Ooh I can't understand why you're removing the sign The bureau is no longer of any use After the minister won, has he taken you under his wing I'm never placed under a wing, I'm his right arm his office manager. I'm changing residence What about me? Get me a job You don't fit in a job. The salary won't suit you You'll go back to your original job Do you want me to go back to one-night stands? Don't be stupid, you'll go back to your real job Don't you carry a diploma in commerce? -Yes - You'll work in commerce You, too, will change residence What about this apartment? This will be a home for the family They too will change residence Why is your mood strange, son? I want to know what goes on in your head?

Yes, mother, and what I tell you to do, just do Here everything will remain as it is I just want to save you from the glare and gossiping of people, specially because we're branching out Your son is riding the wind, Shelbaya And he is taking us with him, Nofal The minister has been in his office for ten minutes And you know this well, everything is negotiable except the orders of the President Try to meet the President and present your point of view But I can't present someone else's point of view and no matter how close I am to the President Goodbye - Good morning, sir - Good morning There are several matters that need your immediate concern Fathi, my trust in you is limitless Any decision you see fit, make it. I authorize you This kind of trust I fear for myself of, and a responsibility I am incapable of handling I'm busy with too many other more important things At last I've found you to carry this burden The big man keeps calling me, the political problems have no end With this kind of trust I can only offer my complete loyalty There is only one little thing - Ask for anything - The party Are you still not officially in the party? If you're not in the party, who is? I don't need anything from the party - I need membership only to be close to you since we want to put our house in order Fill in this form Thank you, Mr. minister Excuse us, Haj Nofal, we burden you with our demands, but we look up to you, you're father of the Pasha What is it you want, boy? Uncle Hussein Fattouh is a kind old man - and seeks a service from you Granted, God willing Sit, son, get him a soft drink or some tea I'm not through, yet. Go to hell! Welcome This one, this one, and this one Quickly Yes, Fathi. What's in all these files? They need your Excellency's signature, they are all requests for petty services from members of the People's Assembly Remove them Now that the election is over, they want to recompensate from month one? Mr. Minister, if you would only be more patient with me How many are the members of the People's Assembly? 450 give or take, I'm not sure Of these 450, how many are influential? Unfortunately, not many 100, may be 50 Of them we need only ten or fifteen members - - to support us constantly - To do what? Does any of them know even how to swat a fly? And besides, if we open the door to these requests, we'll never see the end of it They'll be the soldiers that defend you in time of need and they will be the bouncers - if you need to teach someone a lesson I'll try to understand from you, Fathi, go on Each one of these esteemed members has a following He doesn't get them, they gather around him - You are aware that there are people in the Assembly - who neither understand nor know anything at all Those that you see snoozing or daydreaming Each of them awaits someone else to explain Each one has behind him five or six, ten or twenty Why do we need them? Use them to aggravate your enemies - with huge questions and drown them in legal mumbo-jumbo Keep them exposed constantly, busy defending themselves in every hearing or meeting, and this besides the impression given to the public opinion If I thought like you do two years ago, I'd by now be Prime Minister And these same members will come to our defense - if we ever get the boot Fathi, did you graduate a lawyer or an engineer? I like loyalty in work - What's this chic look? -I am your façade, sir And what a great façade! Congratulations Samira, today you will get a VIP customer, a surprise He asked me from where I got my chic look, I told him No, no discount.. we seek special service We want him to hook on to that chic look Naglaa, there is a company of sweets called Fontana I want its owner or general manager No, I don't know names May I know what's behind this decision of yours? Simple, we have a new financial department - - which has a manager - Who is this manager? - You know - He is my assistant You appoint my assistant as my manager? Each to his ability, Mr. Mohsen Does that mean that I'm not capable enough? You're capable in the position you're in Thank you very much You will receive my resignation in five minutes I'm sure this size will suit you, 54 large - Excuse me - Consider yourself on the beach The swimsuit in any case is much shorter than this Yes, but we must in any case stick to norms Norms are that your Excellency try out in the clearing to feel totally at ease Customers might drop in and you know my position Your position, oh it's taken into total consideration You're worth all the customers we have, I put a sign that says "closed" outside So you can try, try things at ease, Mr. Minister Come out This is much better, that room was crammed and hot and stuffy Mr. Rushdi -Yes... - Samira, my name is Samira What a lovely name! - Mr. Rushdi - Yes, Samira Would you like me to dress you up to my taste? Of course, of course Mr. Rushdi, would you like to try out the jacket first - or the pants? - What do you think? - Both ways are possible Do whatever you want The party at this particular stage - has to present new solutions to the problems facing the country Haven't you noticed that the minister's language - has improved dramatically”? Look at the wizard beside him and you'll know the reason - Who is it? - Later And it is no secret that there are other political forces - that claim nationalism but in fact spray their poisons among the people and so, the spread of trust and calm amongst the masses is in the forefront of duties of the party - Mr. Minister -Yes We hope the Ministry of the Interior fulfills - its duties of security towards the spread of damaging rumors It is assumed that matters like this - are dealt with decisively Democracy There is no turning back on democracy - that the party has chosen - Dialogue - What? The importance of dialogue The importance of dialogue is the basis of democracy Dialogue What dialogue, Mr. Minister? Are these people to open a dialogue with? They have us accused of corruption - and people believe them Let those who speak go on speaking Speech has never held back a people's march This man is corrupted. Get him Stop listening to what others say, but that doesn't mean we defend the corrupters He who sees himself corrupt should have some decency, and as the proverb goes: "People in glass houses.." Who was that sitting next to Rushdi El Khayal? Fathi Nofal, a lawyer and his office manager, Without him, Rushdi is just another ass That kid is dangerous to us, now and in the future Find out about him, there must be something wrong That guy will end up swallowing all of us You don't call, so I thought I'd call You've always been great, Fathi. What'II you drink? I felt that I missed you so I passed by I hear good stuff about you I'm a bit angry at you, not even a phone-call? I know you're busy and didn't want to disturb you My business never keeps me away from my friends - How are you doing? - Fine Your work going on strong? No, I left my job some time ago And did you get a better job? No, there were some developments at my work which didn't suit me I gave in my resignation and they accepted it And now what? Surely I'll find a better job, it's just a matter of time You should have called me Mohsen, we are brothers Do you want to work in any Arab country? I have lots of friends and connections I'm here in this country, Fathi, and will never leave it Strange. My mother's calling on the car-phone My deepest condolences, be strong Strength is from God The deceased was very close to us all And he did great services God bless you But there is one small matter I wish to tell you about Go on Your father, God bless his soul, before he died, took 5000 pounds from me to buy me a flat - but God chose him before he fulfilled his promise He took five thousand pounds? Yes, sir Go take them from him Go take them from him Be calm, Fathi Ya wash ya wash, Fathi Ya wash, O swing Alley alley Oop Yes, put him on Yes, Aly, how are you? I know You can see me any time, Aly Where? OK, Aly - Why this place, Aly? - To ensure secrecy and security, for me and for you - I'm at your disposal - We need a favor of you I owe you a favor, and must fulfill it God bless you, it is also a game of elections - - and we need your help - Which elections? How typical it is of all of you in power, you only note those elections that are big We are not greedy, we seek only the unions, we have our nominees that need strong support - in the Lawyers Union, the Engineering Union... Slow down, what did you say? You heard me well, Fathi You are demanding the impossible, Aly You must differentiate between you and me You are a group unable to develop into a party, and we are a party unable to become a group, and both are against each other You and I are opponents in the same case But in the end we are friends Not at the expense of the case Cases do not belong to lawyers or even judges, but belong to the people concerned, and we are concerned with one and the same case This is not just any case This is a case concerning an entire country I consider it a case of conflict over ownership Consider it as you please, I have paid back for your service several times How, Fathi? Don't ever think you're far from the eyes of state security You are under scrutiny What do you have to do with state security? I'm in a ruling ministry, and my job is politics Your reputation is that you're a religious lawyer, or what is widespread is that you are a religious lawyer You must understand that you are secure thanks to me And you live in luxury thanks to me Let me clarify another matter for you Your presence is closely tied to Rushdi's presence So what will you do my friend when he goes? It is obvious that you will go with him, and you are aware that who goes out never comes back To be with us is better than to be against us, and safer for you also Is this a threat? Don't misunderstand What I meant was that we will win the case in the end When hell freezes over Let's be opponents in a case, and friends in reality Let's not fool each other, Aly There will never be friendship between opponents Two wolves can never exist together in one cage They will tear each other apart - I know a lot about you - I too, know a lot about you Is daddy home? Welcome, Fathi, welcome I'm sorry, I dropped by without prior appointment Don't sermonize, this is your house, please come in Please sit down Mona, ask mommy to make some tea No need Mona, go on studying, I don't want any tea Mona is in third primary, and Akram is in second May God keep them for you Mohsen, how much was your pay at the sweets company? - Why? - Just asking All in all, basic salary, fringe benefits and what have you, 650 pounds Good, because I was worried the new job - I'd offer you had a lower salary It wouldn't differ, Fathi I've grown accustomed to living with any salary The new job offers a salary of five thousand pounds Five thousand pounds? Yes, you will handle administrative matters - in an investment bank Is this job honest? You are useless, Mohsen Just because the salary is big, the job must be dishonest? Fathi, you're behind my getting fired This is true This is an act I fail to understand Don't ever think I want to burden you with gratitude I want nothing of you I've come to do a service to a friend of mine and that's all This job any other incompetent person could have taken - simply for having the right connections Couldn't you at least have discussed the matter with me - and then I would have felt free to accept or not You wouldn't have accepted The storage of slogans inside you would have forced you to decline I know you too well, Mohsen You are a man of law, will accept anything I needed to force you to accept a better future - By order, Fathi? - By order, Mohsen The job's there, go check it out. If you find it dishonest, leave it and I'm ready to return you to your old job by telephone I'll leave you now I know you're wondering why I'm doing this I swear to you by God, I don't know why I'm doing this Take care of yourself Listen, Fathi, certain big whales don't want you to grow, these are people who have no mercy for anyone, and I want you to cover yourself from them, and don't you ever allow them to hold anything against you I am an old man and understand this country well If anyone falls, he never gets up again but I am sure you won't fall It's a great night, when I open the door and see you Have you been here long? - Where were you? - With His Excellency His Excellency has a dirty rotten story - - I know nothing of - Not at all He's well limited, he's a failure at joking but he's great when it comes to teasing and petting Anyway, I didn't come to discuss teasing and petting, You will marry Rushdi El Khayal Why marry him? Matters are smooth and couldn't be better I tell you he's only good at teasing and petting But that is wrong, some people's eyes are watching every move, every moment, they ache for any mistake So matters must be straight, you have to marry him Can I fix you a drink? I'll tell you something that will please you Today we made a bank deposit of 550 thousand pounds And where are they from? Don't tell me they are the winnings of the boutique Is there a boutique that makes half a million pounds per month? This is the money of Ibrahim Antar, whose land you cleared in El Amereya The agreement called for half a million pounds only What are those extra fifty thousand for? The man paid the extra sales tax of his own will Tomorrow you start the proceedings of an export and import enterprise With your help No, keep me away, you have Rushdi El Khayal your husband And what if the man's afraid of his wife and refused to marry? He'll marry alright The petting is more important than his wife - Can you help me? - Of course I'll help you I always like to be on legitimate side of things Do you know what I feel like right now? I know As long as you know, let's go inside It won't work anymore A woman who accepts division over two, I don't need Since when? Have you forgotten that you've known me since - I was like Cinema Miami, whoever has a ticket, enters Starting today, you are full house Fathi? How did you know I was here? I'm your man, sir Leave us alone for a moment - What is it, Fathi? - Nothing, stay relaxed It's all very simple, we need a solution for Samira Rashwan - Is the story out, Fathi? - Don't worry, sir She's a good girl, nice and loyal What is happening is all very simple, we are humans We work hard, sir All our time is dedicated to work and responsibilities, Locked up in offices 18 hours per day We listen only to phones ringing and orders, either the ones we give, or the ones we receive People like us deserve a moment of rest - a moment of joy, a moment of letting go to be able to continue, but matters must be correct What do we do, Fathi? The law, as it serves justice, also serves wrong - and we are people whose wrong must be legal - I don't understand - Just a little piece of paper If things are exposed, it will be an illegal affair But if we have this paper, things will be legal Marry her? Yes, just a little piece of paper, and no one will ever be able to confront us.. it's marriage But this is a frightful thing The girl could abuse this bit of paper And who said she will have the paper? The marriage contract will be in my hands We are only saving ourselves from any talk.
