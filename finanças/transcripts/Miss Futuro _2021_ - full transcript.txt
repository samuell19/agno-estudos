Show me that. I just... didn't like the cover... so I... swapped it. So Saint Augustine's Confessions? It was a buy 2 get 1 promotion in perfect condition... and for free... - Where is Mia Farrow's affair? - I still didn't get there. It could have been worse, Sister Patrocinio got busted reading Diana. Her true story. And she never came back... Here. It's not bad that a nun wants to know, that she has... a certain spiritual curiosity. But one should never be led off the path, and you're further and further away. Remember... when you lost that volume of Hollywood Babylon? Well you didn't just lose it, I took it. I found your hiding place. But you kept on looking for bargain books. Sister, I'm so sorry. Don't be. You must be expelled now. Sister Cassandra, please. I didn't mean to... It doesn't have to be final. You'll have time now to re-focus your goal, to turn your life over to God. You'll watch movies again, only not devilish ones, but Christian. What you really want is to be an actress again. No, no, that belongs to the past. Discover it by yourself. Begin an evangelizing mission. Go back to Madrid. Find a talents agent. Make a new showreel. You'll only then know if it's true vocation or hellish temptation. Listen to your Sister and friend, who only wants your best. We need Christian actresses, in theaters and movies. Actresses who can say no to a line of coke or to a regular role in a TV series. Sister, I am... really touched. Stop that and listen to me. I was dying to undertake this mission, and you're the one I'll entrust it to. Pick up all your stuff, just leave the key in the drawer at the hall. Once you're in the streets, do as follows: Start... in the Retiro Park. Just next to the Demon Statue, where cross-fitters work out, before reaching the book market, To the right... there it is. The cruising area. Everyday, before sunset, hundreds of strangers crowd among the brush. Hiding behind the bushes and the foliage. Men seeking other men some just for the money, most just out for sheer perversion, looking for stealthy, ominous, addictive sex. They are... bottoms, tops, versatiles, fascists, polyamourous, neighbors, athletes, retired... transvestites, married, and even priests. Men practising... fellatio, Black kiss, white as well, Threesomes, bukkake, dildo smuggling, double blowjob, spanking, fist fucking, bondage, even bareback sex. Careful, don't trust the guys wearing patriotic or religious bracelets, They are the worst. A real descent into hell to meet Devil face to face. I can't think of a better test for your comeback to the outside world. If you get away with it, you'll be... beatified! Pss, pss! Hash. Psss... Popper. Popper. What the hell... - Hey! - Bebe? Bitch... Bitch, how are you? I think I just pulled a hammy. Lean up against the tree. What are you doing here? - I mean.. - And you? Well, it's a long story... How's your comeback to theater? Are you looking for a manager? Do you even have social networks? I think I might have Facebook... That's so old school. You gotta get an Instagram, or a TikTok. - Yeah? - Yeap, a TikTok. Sure... I was also thinking about... maybe... reaching out to former colleagues... Yeah, you know, I know some people but they are really high-up. Not sure they'll be willing to help somebody that's starting off. Don't you keep other connections? From back then... Let me think, maybe from the theater group. Patricia? Patricia! She's pregnant now! - Wow. - Yeah. I can't believe it! Just call her, maybe they need an understudy in the group. - Do you think? - Yeah. She keeps the same number, I recall. Well... then... I'll give it a thought. - OK, then. - Yeah... Do you have it with you? Was it very difficult to get it out of the convent? Not really. If it's not figurative... they don't care much. In fact, it's hard to imagine how it got there. So this is the last one you were missing... you said, right? Yes, the last M.B. It's a self-portrait of the artist. M.B? Yeah, he's an artist who moved to New York. He became big there. But overnight, he went missing. They say he used plastic surgery and got a new identity. Or maybe he just threw himself into the Hudson river. So... We don't know anything for sure. No, no... Only that he disappeared. Is there any theory as to why? In NYC, he met Dr. Raglan. Do you know him? No. Dr. Raglan invented psychoplasmics. It's a therapy to let go of your trauma and inner fears, you release them out of your mind through physiological changes to your body. That's why M.B. looked like this, in his last days. So he somatized his own trauma... into his body? Right. So all M.B.'s work revolved around it. For instance, this work. It is said that he created it, solely with his mind, not using his hands at all. And so he made this sculpture. You mean like... he laid the material there... and the work emerged just like that? Exactly. I know it's hard to believe. But... Yeah, it means 'give up all hope'. Well, then. I'm happy I helped you close the circle. Yes, I really am too. And then you know, after he vanished all his work become more valuable. All you can see here is worth quite a lot of money. - Speaking of which, I'll pay you. - OK. It's a check, if you don't mind. No, as long as... Don't worry, the check is good. Here you go. 10,000 euros, what we agreed. Thank you very much. Thank you. Enjoy it. I'll see you out. Patri, look who's here. - Hi. - Hello!! It's been such a long time! You're looking so good! You were gone too far! Let me look at you. What do you think? Oh my god, oh my god. I'm so fat! My belly gets everywhere 20 seconds before me. It's gigantic. You look just gorgeous. - Should we put these in water? - I love them! They are gladioli. They look beautiful! Let's leave them here, I'll tell Isaac later to put them in water. I try to live it with love, all this wiggling and so on. But sometimes it's so extreme, that I get scared. I only had seen these movements in... Poltergeist, Alien... I mean, wow, the belly... It moves... extremely. Imagine, suddenly I feel a bulge going out here, another one there. There's a kind of a swirl or like a wave. She has her head down here, and here... the spine, the butt, and her little legs. I think her knee is here. So sometimes she pulls it out and stretches her leg out here... Crazy stuff! When she does it, I freak out. It feels like she's going to break me. But then I just try to send her my love. 'Cause... it feels bad to get scared by your own baby. But I do get scared! And I guess some people patronize you... Even when you just tell people you're pregnant... only so they know about it, they react as if they had to give you their opinion... about parenthood. Sometimes even negative opinions. More than once, the feedback I got from people who are reluctant or fearful to it, is... "Oh my god, you got yourself into a big mess", "What a responsibility". And... I find it ironic 'cause in the end... well, of course, this will change you... It's already changing me. It's an important responsibility. The biggest one in my life maybe. But... It's not preventing me from doing anything. From being yourself, you mean? Yeah, or from living experiences or adventures. The adventure simply takes another shape. A wider one maybe... Well... Say like when you're single, for instance. People expect you you to be there for them. For everything... Yeah. And then people come to you with their own... reflections on how parenthood makes them feel. Those who don't want kids? Yeah, 'cause I want to be free. But are you really free? Aren't you a slave to your job? To your... your... to your vices? To capitalism? And to consumerism. Exactly, compulsive consumerism. Yes, of course we're not free, nobody is. And I don't think this experience takes freedom off of you. What's more... what happens to you now, takes on, so to say, an unusual importance in your life. It's something one has never experienced before. At least I hadn't. By the way, how are the others? Ana... Carmen... I told them you're here! They are coming any minute now. - Really? - Yeah. - Are you kidding me? - I'm not! I told them you're back, and obviously they wanted to see you. Yaay. So we can all catch up... I know Ana had a baby, right? Yeah! She's bringing him today. Seriously? - Of course, so you can get to know him. - Aaaaaww! So you never met him... which means you haven't been around since then? Right. I can't believe it. It's been over two years... Ana's son is 2 years old already. I mean... I heard about it... but... you know, I have been missing out. Totally off. We were so surprised... when you disappeared just like that. - I can imagine. - Yeah... It took us by surprise, it hurt, we missed you... but we respected your decision. Your path. It's a different type of search. It was tough. We're not at a time... where a religious path can easily be taken. - Giving oneself to mysticism. - Absolutely. - Anyway... - I'm sure many didn't understand... or supported you. Few people did... very few. This is the plant you brought us! It keeps on growing and growing. Two years ago it was this small and look now. Here you have all that it needs to grow, so much light! I want to think that it is... like when people go to India. They go to India one year to find themselves... then they are different when they return. I never quite got that. Well, hello, you spent two years in a convent! OK, I see what you mean... Making a commitment with a different way of life. Yeah, finding a lot of stuff inside you. I've never done this but I can imagine... And then one emerges as a different person. Sometimes you just get stuck. Yeah, we get single-minded, and limit ourselves. Change is good. It is positive. Whatever you decide for yourself, it will be OK. Don't let anybody tell you, that you cannot start over again. Obviously you are not the same person you were, and the context has also changed. Don't let them make you feel that you cannot... find your own way back. You can nourish from theater in a different way. And success is maybe not your main goal. Maybe you just want to enjoy doing it. Right? I mean, if you decide to go back to theater. I think one can try several paths... and then decide how to move forward. Yeah, I'm still on the lookout for my beliefs. I just don't know... I barely remember that time I went to a bar... like with life music. Or that I went to a show... like an audiovisual show. Or a concert... And you missed that... You guys know how I like music... it fascinates me. I adore electronic music. - That's why we didn't understand a thing. - Nothing! Nothing... It's been such a radical change. But I'm happy you want to... find new angles, and live life like you used to. And that you are here with us. We missed you! I know. It's been a huge miss. Not having you around. And I think that faith you're seeking... you can find it anywhere. Just don't leave us again! Don't lock yourself anywhere! We missed you so much! Me too... A lot. How could I not... If you couldn't go to any concert! You just exercise your mind. Learning... to be apart from your loved ones. I believe theater, arts, need women like you, who come with their kids. That you can see them. I love you, mommy. Me too, honey! I love you! Are you taping us? A toast for a wonderful gig we gave for the seniors. Best audience ever. We'll be back. Cheers! Hi Pablo, how are you? I just heard your message. Look, I might not be able to meet you next week. I will probably not be in the city. I'm thinking... I'm gonna leave. I feel a bit weird in Madrid. It's like I came back here, and everybody is at a different stage from me. I need some distance. Grab... a different path... that takes me somewhere. Like the Road to Oz. Since I have no yellow brick road, I might as well look on Skyscanner. The farther, the better. Maybe Tokyo, maybe New York... It's a lot of things... - Hi. - Hi, are you Ada? - Yes, Conchita? - Yeah, come in. Hold on a sec. - How are you? - Good, and you? Fine too. Patri told me you were coming. Just give me a second. Sure. I have some urgent work... No worries. I'm done, come this way. Sure. We can sit there. Is here OK? Yeah. What we do in this agency, and that's actually my job, is to connect the actors with the authors, so that you lose fear to ask them for texts, etc. So I cannot help you as an actors' agent, but I can show you a whole new world of possibilities, that maybe you want to try. That's actually very useful. It's like a... new path. A different door. I don't know how your stay at the convent was, but I'm sure you created an intimate reality, a self-knowledge, that you can leverage as a way of expressing yourself, via all these new trends in theater. Like autofiction or other forms of post-modern theater, where you narrate theater plays from a different angle. I definitely encourage you to look into that. And like I said before, you now have something uniquely yours. And you have to take all that and transform it into art. Your own art. I can feel it, that after this experience, I have something inside, and it's wrestling its way out, in some way. That has to go out, beyond looking for an agent or a text. You've made the trip but it was only one way. The return journey is still left. You said it before... you made this trip but suddenly you face the same outer reality again. The same you left 2 years ago. The trip is not completed until one makes it to the destination. You're now stopping over between airports. You need to go on. The other side of the metaphor is to transfer all this to a different place. Maybe this is not the place right now. I mean, it can be... but you may also want to look somewhere else... The truth is I haven't worn my regular outfits for... two years! I was just wearing the habit all the time. Did it look good on you? Well... you just end up getting used to everything. Even wearing the same clothes everyday, you still feel different. Ada, Ada... Are you with... I mean, 'cause you liked girls, boys... Well, yes... This is something I always liked, you never went one way or the other. There's no need, right? No need... I agree. And you? Are you seeing anybody? I didn't even have the time... to see anybody. I met the girls Carmen, Patri... Ana. How are they? Very well. Very well. With children, or pregnant... And I'm like... You and I should have had a baby, right? You and I? Maybe... I don't know... it could be... it's kind of scary... but I feel things inside. Of course I do. I'm here with you now... and I feel things. I still feel them. Don't look at me so seriously, Pablo. You're not exactly a serious person. I'm just so shocked. - And she told me yes... - Sorry, that must be my boss. It's my boss, I promise. Why wouldn't I believe it? With you it's hard to know. He's gonna fire me. - Is he firing you? - Yes. - You wanna call him? - No, it's fine. I'll call him from the train, I'm leaving in 5 minutes. You talk like you're going to war. Just everything is really horrible right now. I'm stressed out. You should also leave. But c'mon Pablo, that's just your day job. Don't think it over too much. It is fucked up, really. - I became the most negative person on earth. - I can see it! You look just gorgeous. So you are seeing Ms Treviño now, then? Yeap, we're going to the Museum together. I know it's weird, meeting a casting director like this. But I know her 'cause we have common friends, etc. It is not easy, you know? It isn't easy. Take my advice, just leave. I'm so mixed up. Honestly. I don't know... I feel like all the time I'm... just breaking walls. And it couldn't be any other way. I feel like I have to go through these walls. Otherwise I'll get stuck somewhere I don't want to stay. But it's so weird, I feel like... like... walking in the dark. You just follow your intuition, but you can bump your head any moment. Having that over your shoulders can be pretty exhausting. Sometimes I just get too anxious. I gave my spiel... Not at all. I love seeing you. It's only a word, that lingers behind when you love. Everyone who loves, burns. And everyone who burns, flies at the speed of light. Because loving means being... what one loves. I'm so glad you texted me, I was meaning to do it myself, send you a picture of the baby. I guess you must have heard the news from Ana, Carmen or somebody... Our little one has finally come into this world. We are in a sort of... haze of oxytocin. We are so happy, just in love with our baby, she's so beautiful. Now we are just learning to understand each other, understand what she wants to tell us when she cries. That's where we are now. We feel like a sense of elation, and we are just so happy that the baby is well. Now I'm in this kind of... newborn haze, with all the hormones firing, but I just see her so beautiful! I don't know, judge for yourself... I'm sending you a pic now. I just fell in love very deeply. I can't wait for you to meet her. No! I was thinking, is it her? Wait... You are... We know each other from Spain. Yeah, we met in Madrid. At the Binomio club, right? Oh my god! It can't be... How are you? Good! What are you doing here? It's a very long story. Let's go sit down. I'll go grab a beer. Go! I have to admit that, here sometimes I feel out of place. I feel the cultural shock. I'm kind of sensing... the difference, And also I feel like New York has this energy... Exactly. I was about to say, Sometimes I feel that energy so strongly! It's like you come here being... too pure. So to speak. One comes from a place which is your comfort zone. That's it, that's what I'm thinking all the time. And when you get out of it, you are in this vulnerable state. You get here, and the city has... this strong centrifugal energy. It's like suddenly... it hauls you. You have to watch out, protect yourself. And we followed a similar path, so I think I know where all this comes from. And what do you recommend? I can tell you what I did! And I'm not saying you have to do the same. I went to see this person... She is an expert in working with energies. I believe in these things, but obviously this is up to you. I'm just saying, if you have this spiritual side... - She's like a healer? - She's a shaman. - So somebody who connects two worlds? - Yes. And she is, totally professional, has a lot of experience, not expensive at all. She's not after the money, she does it for the healing. Look. You know what they do here? - Skating! - Really? I swear. Skating like in... Dressed like in the 70s? Each in their own way. There's a bit of everything, but the topic is Xanadu. When is it? I don't know, but the venue is amazing, isn't it? - It's great. - Yeah. So cool. I'm so happy to see you. Me too! You know what? I'm gonna give you this woman's number. And then it's up to you, but I feel like I have to give it to you. Just call her on my behalf. OK. - Give it to me. - Save it on your phone. Three, six, four, two. Got it? Got it. - Thank you! - Just give her my name, she'll know. - Thanks again. - I'll do you good. I think that one is... Come in. Hi. - Come in. - How are you? A little hot. Hot! Shirts open... Shirts open! Welcome. Thank you so much. How can I help you? I got your number from... Nicole... You know, that Chilean girl. Cachái! Shady girl, you know. I was at that party with her... and those cigars she rolls... She rolls the best ones. She always puts in this... green sparkling stuff... they seize you. Yeah? - Does it bother you if I smoke? - Not at all. She is shady. - Ella te jala. - Te jala? She pulls you in. A lot of this that you have, you know like... She wants to take all of this. From you. The city... you have to be a little careful. Watch out. The city sees it when you... sparkle. She wants to use you, to put you into the circle. The circle... They keep you. You get stuck. Then you have to be careful. So you've been going to a lot of these parties. That's how they get you. You may lose everything. Yeah? There's no way of getting whatever you have left back. What troubles you? Nicole told me... I looked different, a little weird. She always sees y'all weird. You know... I guess this is where you start. Let's pull one. Scissors... A hidden message for you... You gotta cut something out that isn't working for you. So that means that I should cut something out. That is maybe... taking some energy from me... I think, it's just... You know... At those parties, you're hiding. What do you mean? Sometimes if you're at the bathroom all the time, 'cause I know Nicole. She likes to have a lot of fun. And she likes to have her little friends. She likes to keep all her friends... in line. I need a candle here. Let's see what you're really here for. Why are you in New York? Eight of Cups. I think you're not willing to tap into... something deeper in you. Sometimes you just get in, and we all like parties. But you're not showing yourself. I think that, you have to cut something out. Or you have to find it in your past. OK. Let's take one more. Let's see... why you're really here. Because you ignore those feelings that you get about things that you already know. And you're not willing to explore. You don't allow yourself to know more. You have a skill, you have a gift. But you hide. You hide in... the bathroom with Nicole. So many people at those parties, and you're just too busy... hiding. What should I do then? I'm gonna... light some candles tonight. OK. And you're gonna go to this party in a... warehouse. And you'll see the signs. And you'll have to find your way... to find what you're looking for. But it's a little... dirty. The party? Well... Sometimes we find things in ourselves which are otherwise hidden. - At the parties? - Yeah. That's interesting. - Hi! - Hi. How are you? What's your name? Ada. Ada... I'm Sundari, the Indian Goddess. Bless you. From New York to Madrid, and all around the world, You're blessed.
