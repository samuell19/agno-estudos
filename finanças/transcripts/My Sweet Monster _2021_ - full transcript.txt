♪♪ [Prince Edward] With barely enough time to recover from my previous heroic feat, I was on the road to a new adventure. The people of the neighboring kingdom turned to me for help... a dreadful serpent took their princess. Again, a new exciting quest only Prince Edward can take! I arrived at the giant serpent's mountain lair. One of the Earth's most vile creatures did not expect that anyone would be brave enough to challenge it. Beware of my sword's shiny blade! - Ha ha! - [bell tolls] [Barbara] "With the giant serpent defeated, the princess was free at last. Tears sparkled in her eyes like diamonds. 'I love you, Prince Edward, ' she whispered to me passionately. I moved a lock of auburn hair away from her face, and said to her with a sad smile, 'Forgive me, for my heart forever belongs to another.' Suddenly, I felt the vile breath of doom. I turned my head and saw the frightful open mouth of the beast!" To be continued... ♪♪ - [nanny 1] Barbara? - Barbara? - Barbara? - Barbara? She was here a moment ago.
