Flint Quidditch practice I booked the patch for Gryffindor today easy,Woods, I've got note oh, a small trouble I, Professor Severus Snape, hereby give the Slytherin team permission to practice today owing to the need to train their new Seeker. you got new seeker, who? Malfoy? that's right,that's not always you want to see it those are Nimbus Two Thousand and Ones, how did you get those? gift from Draco's father you see, Weasley, unlike some my father can afford the best At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in They got in on pure talent.

Ron? say something well, can you turn around, Harry no, Colin, get out the way let's take him to Hagrid how long it'll do? opps, this calls the real special equipment nothing to do but wait for it to stop,I am afraid Better out than in, who's he tried to curse, anyway? Malfoy he called Hermione A..., well,I don't know exactly what it means he called me mudblood he did not what's mudblood? it means dirty blood Mudblood's a really foul name for someone who is Muggle-born some one with no magic parents some one like me it's sort of tongue when you usually hear stuff in conversation so thing is, Harry there are some wizards - like Malfoy's family who think they're better than everyone else because they're what people call pure-blood it's horrible it's disgusting aren't just call what up to birth dirty blood, there is no wizard alive day that is no halfblood or less more to the point, not yet a sigle spell our Hermione can' do come here don't you think on it, Hermione don't you think on it for one minute Harry, Harry, harry, can you possibly imagine? a better way to serve the detention? by helping me to answer my fan mail? not really Fame's a fickle friend, Harry Celebrity is as celebrity does remember that [Come ... come to me.... Let me rip you.... Let me tear you .... Let me kill you . .] what? sorry? that voice voice? didn't you hear it? what are you talking about? Harry are you getting a lit bit drowsy? Great Scott -no wonder, look at the time! We've been here nearly four hours! spooky, how the time flys when we're having fun spooky [I smell blood, let me rip you,let me kill you,kill....] Harry! did you hear it? hear what? that voice voice? what voice? I heard it first at Lockhart office, then again, it just it's moving I think it's gonna kill kill? Harry, wait, don't be so fast strange I've never seen spiders act like that I don't like spiders what's that? the chamber of secret has been opened enemies of the heir...be ware it's written in blood oh, no enemies of heir, be ware you'll be the next, mudblood what's going on there? go out of my way, my way, my way Potter? what do you...... you murdered my cat no, no I'll kill ya I'll kill ya! Argus! Argus! every one will proceed to dormitory immediately, every one, except, you three ...Gryffindors, follow me... she is not dead, Argus she has been petrified ah, Potter,so unluck I wasn't there I know the exact the countercurse that could've spare her but how she's been petrified, I can not say ask him he must've done it, you saw what he wrote on the wall it is not true, sir, I swear I've never touch Mrs. Norris rubbish If I might, Headmaster? perhaps Potter and his friends were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time however the circumstances are suspicious I, for one, don't recall seeing Potter at dinner I am afraid that's my doing, Severus you see, Harry's helping answer my fan mail that's why Ron and I're looking for him,professor we just found when he said yes, Mrs Granger? when I said I wasn't hungry we were heading back to common room when we found Mrs. Norris innocent until proven guilty,Severus my cat has been petrified I want to see some punishment we will be able to cure her,Argus as I understand at the mean time, I strongly recommend caution to all it's bit strange, isn't it? strange? you heard the voice, it's just strange do you think I should've told them, Dumbledore and others, I mean are you mad? no,Harry, even in the wizard world, hearding voices isn't a good sign she is right, you know could I have your attention please? right, now, today we will be transforming animals into water goblets like this,1, 2, 3 fetherfethertol now, it's your turn well, who would like to go first oh, Mr.Weasley, 1, 2, 3, fetherfethertol fethervertol that one need replacing, Mr.Weasley yes, Mrs Granger professor, I was wondering If you can tell us,about,the chamber of secret very well, you all knew, of course Hogwart was founded over thousands years ago by the four greatest wizards and witches of age Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin. three of the founders concensused quite harmoniously one did not, so we guess it is who Slytherin wished to be more selective about the students admitted to Hogwarts. He believed that magical learning should be kept within all-magic families. in another words, pure blood unable to persuade others, he desided to leave the school now, according to legend Slytherin had built a hidden chamber in this castle known as the chamber of secret though shockly, before departed, he sealed it until that time when his own true heir returned to the school the heir alone will be able to open the chamber and unleash the horror within, and by so doing to purge the school of all those who in Slytherin's view were unworthy to study magic. muggleborn Naturally,the school has been searched many times no such chamber has been found professor what's exactly the legend tell us the light in the chamber? the chamber is said to be home to something that only the heir of Slytherin can control it is said to be the home of a monster so it is true, she told us there is really a chamber of secret yes, could you tell? McGonagall's worried and all the teachers are and if there is really a chamber of secret and really hasn't been opened that means, the heir of Slytherin has returned Hogwart the question is, who is it? that's stink,who do we know who thinks all muggleborns are scums If you're talking about Malfoy of course, you heard him You'll be next,Mudbloods! I heard him but,Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin? maybe Ron is right, Hermione I mean, look at his family,The whole lot of them have been in Slytherin for centuries Crabbe and Goyle must know,maybe we can trick him to tell them even they aren't that pig, but there might be another way remind you, it would be difficult not mention we'll break about 50 school rules and it'll be dangerous very dangerous here it is Polyjuice Potion. properly brewed Polyjuice Potion allows the drinker to transform himself temporaly into phisical form of other here,you know,if Harry and I drink that stuff we'll turn to Crabbe and Goyle yes you kidding.. Malfoy'll tell us anything exactly but truth is I've never see a more complicated potion eh, well, how long will it take to make? a month a month but, Hermione, if Malfoy is the heir of Slytherin, he could've attacked half muggleborns in the school by then I know but it's the only plan we got another ball for Slytherin they lead Gryffindor 90 to 30 All right there, Scarhead? watch yourself, Harry wood, look out Hermione Harry got himself a wild Bludger let's be tempered, we said, us no, stop it no, even with proper one is too risky even with proper one is too risky you could hurt Harry training for the ballet, Potter? you gonna catch me? Potter? let's go Harry Potter caught the Snitch, Gryffindor win! thank you are you ok? no, I think my arm broke do not worry, Harry I will fix that of your arms straight away no, not you you don't know what are you saying...now this won't hurt a bit BRAKYAMY IMENDO ah,yes, well, that can sometimes happen but the point is you can no longer feel any pain and very clearly, the bones are not broken broken? there is no bones left much more flexible though oh, Mr Malfoy I will make things as fast as you can go out my way, out my way You should have come straight to me! I can mend bones in a hard speed - but growing them back You will be able to, won't you? I'll be able to, certainly, but it will be painful You're in for a rough night, Potter regrowing bones is a nasty bussiness what do you expect? Pumkin juice? [kill...kill...] hello Dobby? Harry Potter should've listened to Dobby Harry Potter should've gone back home when he missed the train it was you,You stopped the barrier from letting Ron and me through! Indeed, yes, sir you nearly got Ron and me expelled at least you would be away from here Harry Potter must go home Dobby thought his Bludger would be enough to make Harry Potter see the... your Bludger? you made that Bludger chase after me? Dobby feels the most grief, sir Dobby had to iron his hands You'd better clear off before my bones come back, Dobby, or I might strangle you. Dobby is used to death threats, sir. Dobby gets them five times a day at home. I don't suppose you could tell me why you tried to kill me? not kill you, sir, never kill you Dobby remmeber Harry Potter before Harry Potter trumphed over He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named We house-elfs were treated like vermin, sir! Of course, Dobby is still treated like vermin ah..ah.... why do you wear that thing, Dobby? This, sir? This a mark of the house-elf's enslavement Dobby can only be freed if his masters present him with clothes listen, listen, terrible thing is about to happen in Hogwart Harry Potter must not stay here Now, that history is to repeat itself repeat itself, you mean this' happened before? eh--I shouldn't have said that bad Dobby stop stop, stop, Dobby tell me, Dobby when did this happen before? who is doing it now? Dobby can not say, sir Dobby only want Harry potter to be safe no, Dobby, tell me, who is it? put him here what happened? there's been another attack I think, do you know,I think he's been petrified,Madam Pomfrey. you don't think perhaps he managed to get a picture of his attacker? What can this mean, Albus? it means our students are in great danger what you have to tell the staff? the truth, tell them, the Hogwart is no longer safe it is as we feared, meanever that the Chamber of Secrets has indeed been opened again. again? you mean the chamber of secret had been opened before? of course don't you see? Lucius Malfoy must've opened the Chamber when he was at school here now he's told Draco how to do it maybe, but we have to wait Polyjuice potion to make sure and why it's me,why are we brewing this potion in poor daylight in the middle of girl's never treat don't you think we'll get caught? no no one ever comes in here why? Moaning Myrtle who? Moaning Myrtle who is Moaning Myrtle? I am Moaning Myrtle I wouldn't expect you to know me who would ever talk about ugly,miserable,moping, Moaning Myrtle? she is a little sensitive gather around, gather around, can everybody see me? can you all hear me? excellent in lights of dark events of recent weeks Professor Dumbledore has granted me permission to start this little dueling club, to train you all up in case you ever need to defend yourselves as I myself have done on countless occasions to full details, see my published works let me introduce my assistant professor Snape he has sportingly agreed to help me with a short demonstration Now, I don't want any of you youngsters to worry you'll still have your Potions master when I'm through with him, never fear! 1,2,3 Expelliarmus! do you think he is all right? who cares? an excellent idea to show them that,Professor Snape, but if you don't mind my saying it was pretty obvious what you were about to do. If I had wanted to stop you it would have been only too easy perhaps it would be prudent to first teach the student to block unfriendly spell, professor Excellent suggestion, professor Snape let's have volunteer pair Potter,Weasley, how about you? Weasley is one causes devastation with simpliest spell who sent Harry Potter to hospital wing in match box may I suggest some one from my own house? Malfoy? perhaps? good luck, Potter yea,sir wands at ready scared? Potter you wish on the count of three cast your charms to disarm your opponents - only to disarm we don't want any accidents here 1,2 Ivertasvaty Rictusempra!

I bet loads of people here can do it. no they can't,It's not a very common gift. Harry this is bad what's bad? if I hadn't told that snake not to attack Justin - Oh, that's what you said to it? you were there, you heard me I heard you speaking Parseltongue, snake language I spoke in different language? but I didn't realize it how could I speak a language without knowing I can I don't how it does, but sound like you acted signal or something Harry, listen to me as the vision symbol of Slytherin House is a serpent. Salazar Slytherin was a Parselmouth, he could talk to snakes too exactly And now the whole school's going to think you're his great-great-great-great-grandson or something but I am not it can't be, he lived thousands years ago, for we know, you could be see you back in common room [kill you...rip you..kill you...] Caught in the act! all that will be acted, Potter no, Mr.Filch you don't understand professor, I swear I didn't... this is out of my hands, Potter Professor Dumbledore will be waiting for you SHEBERDLEMON professor Dumbledore?

Father's always said Dumbledore was the worst thing that's ever happened to this place. you're wrong what? you think some one here is worse than Dumbledore? well, do you? Harry Potter? good one, Goyle, you absolutely right Saint Potter And people actually think he's heir Slytherin ! but then you must have some idea who is behind it all you know I don't, Goyle I told you yesterday how many times do I have to tell you? is this yours? but my father did say this it's been 50 years since the chamber was opened he wouldn't tell me who opened it only they were spelled the last time the chamber of secret was opened a mudblood died so it's only matter of time before one of them's killed this time as to me I hope it's Granger what's the matter with you two you're acting very odd it's his stomachache calm down scar hey, where are you going? that was close Hermione, come on, we've got loads to tell you go away wait you'll see it's awful Hermione, are you ok? do you remmeber me telling you? the polyjuice potion is only for the human transformations it was cat hair I pulled off Millicent Bulstrode's robes look at my face look at your tail we spoke to Hermione she'll sleep in hospital for a few days when she stop coughing out furballs what's this? yark,looks like Moaning Myrtle flooded the bathroom Come to throw something else at me? Why would I throw something at you? don't ask me Here I am,minding my own business, and someone thinks it's funny to throw a book at me ...... But it can't hurt you if someone throws something at you I mean, it'd just go right through you so!!Let's all throw books at Myrtle, because she can't feel it! Ten points if you can get it through her stomach! Fifty points if it goes through her head! but,Who threw it at you, anyway? I don't know I didn't see them I was just sitting in the U-bend, thinking about death and it fell right through the top of my head Tom Maryold Riddle my name is Harry Potter "Hello, Harry Potter, my name is Tom Riddle" do you know anything about the chamber of secrets "yes" can you tell me?

Bad business, Hagrid,Very bad business. Had to come. three attacks on Muggle-borns. Things've gone far enough. Ministry's got to act. I never,You know I never, Professor I want it understood, Cornelius, that Hagrid has my full confidence Albus Look, Hagrid's record is against him. I've got to take him take me? take me where? Not Azkaban prison? I am afraid we have no choice, Hagrid already here, Fudge, good what are you doing here? get out of my house believe me,I absolutely have no pleasure at all being inside your - er you call this a house? I simply called at the school and was told that the headmaster was here. and what exactly is it that you want with me? the other governors and I desided it's time for you to step aside. This is an Order of Suspension you'll find all twelve signatures on it. I'm afraid we feel you're losing your touch. well, with all those attacks there'll be no Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts I can only imagin what an awful loss that would be to the school. you can't take professor Dumbledore away take him away, the muggleborns won't stand a chance you have my word, There'll be killing next! you think so Calm yourself, Hagrid If the governors desire my removal I will of course step aside however you will find the help will always be given to Hogwarts to those who ask for it any more sentiments? shall we? come, Hagrid well if if anybody was looking some stuff that all they have to do would be to follow the spiders yeah, that will lead them right that's all I have to say oh, well,some one need to feed Fang when I am away good boy Hagrid is right Dumbledor gone here will be attack everyday look come on come on, Fang come on what ? you heard what Hagrid said follow the spiders they're heading to the dark forest why spiders why can't we follow the butterflies? Harry, I don't like this Harry, I don't like it at all can we go back now? come on who is it? don't panic Hagrid, is that you? we are friends of Hagrid's and you you are Aragog, aren't you? yes Hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before he is in trouble, up in the school, for the punish of attacks they think it's Hagrid they think he open the chamber of secrets they think he opened the chamber of secrets like before that's a lie Hagrid'd never opened the chamber of the secrets then ,you are not the monster no the monster was born in the castle I came to Hagrid from a distant land in the pocket of a traveler but if you are not the monster, then what did kill that girl 50 years ago we do not speak of it it's an ancient creature we spiders fear above all others but have you seen it? I never saw any part of the castle with the books in which Hagrid kept me the girl was discovered in bathroom when I was accused,Hagrid brought me here Harry what? well, thank you we'll just go go I think not My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid, on my command. But I can not deny them fresh meat, when it wanders so willingly into our midst. goodbye friends of Hagrid can we go back now? know any spells? one but it's not powerful enough for all of them where is Hermione when you need her let's go RONIEGEZIMEIY glad we're out there ERMONIAEXPAY thanks for that don't mention it get out of here now come on come on, a little faster go, go get us in the air the flying gear is jammed come on oh, I am trying follow the spiders follow the spiders if Hagrid ever get out of Azkaban , I will kill him I mean what was the point of sending us in there what we found out? we know one thing Hagrid'd never opened the chamber of secrets he was innocent I wish you were here, Hermione we need you now more than ever what's that? Ron this why Hermione was in the library the day she was attacked come on of many fearsome beasts and monsters that roam our land none is more more deadly than the Basilisk capable of living for hundreds of years instant death awaits any who meets this giantic serpent's eyes Spiders flee before it Ron, this is it the monster in chamber of secrets is a basilisk that's why I can hear its speak it's a snake but if it kills by looking people in the eye why is it no one's died? because no one did look in the eye not directly at least Colin saw it through his camera Justin Justin must've seen the basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick! Nick got the full blast of it, but he is a ghost, he couldn't die again and Hermione had the mirror I bet you anything she was using it to look around corners in case it came along and Mrs. Norris I'm pretty sure she didn't have a camera or mirror, Harry the water that was the water on the floor that night she only saw the Basilisk's reflection spiders flee before it it all fits but how's Basilisk been getting around? A dirty great snake . . . Someone would've seen it... Hermione thought that too pipes it's using the plumbing remmeber what Aragog said: about that girl 50 years ago? she died in the bathroom what if she'd never left? Moaning Myrtle? All students to return to their House dormitories at once. All teachers return to second floor corrider. Immediately as you can see the heir of Slytherin has left another message the worst fear has been realized, a student has been taken by the monster into the chamber itself students must be sent to home I am afraid this is the end of Hogwarts so sorry, dozed off, what I missed a girl has been snatched by the monster,Lockhart your moment has come at last my? no...no... Weren't you saying just last night that you've known all along where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is? that's settled we will leave you to deal with the monster,Gilderoy your skills, after all, are legend very well I'll just be in my office, getting...getting ready who is it the monster has taken another? Ginny Weasley her Skeleton will lie in the chamber forever Ginny... Lockhart maybe useless, but if He's going to try and get into the Chamber. at least we can tell him what we know professor, we have some information for you are you going somewhere? oh, yes, eh.. urgent call, unavoidable, got to go what about my sister? as for that, most unfortunate no one regrets more than I you are the defense against the dark art teacher you can't go now I must say, when I took the job, there was nothing in the job description about the... you are running away? After all that stuff you did in your books Books can be misleading you wrote them my dear boy ,do you use your common sense? My books wouldn't have sold half as well if people didn't think I'd done all those things you are a fraud you've just been taking credit for other wizards have done? so anything you can do? yes now you mentioned it I am rather gifted in memory charms otherwise you see,all those wizards would've gone blabbing and I'd never sold another book in fact I, eh, I am 'eh,going to have to do the thing to you don't even think about it oh, who's there? oh, hello,Harry what do you want? to ask you how you died? it was dreadful it happened right here in this dirty cubicle I'd hidden because Olive Hornby was teasing me about my glasses I was crying then I heard somebody come in who was it, Myrtle? I don't know I was distrought! but they said something funny a kind of madeup language, and I realized it was a boy's speaking so I unlocked the door to tell him, "go away" and , I died.. just like that, how? I just remember seeing a pair of great, big, yellow eyes. over there by that sink this is it this is it,Ron,I think this is the entrance of chamber of secrets say something Harry, say something in Parseltongue. excellent, Harry ha, good work, then, I'll just be... there is no need for me to stay you first no boys, what good it will do? better you than us you sure you don't want to test it first? really quite filth down here all right let's go oh, Harry if you die down there, you are welcome to share my toilet eh, thanks, Myrtle now, remmeber any signs of movement, close your eyes straight away go on this way what is this? it looks like a snake it's snake skin bloody hell I am sure this must be 60 feet long hard to a liar this one adventure ends here, boys but don't fright the world will know our story but however it's too late to save the girl how you two tragically lost your minds at the sight of her mangled body so, you first, Mr. Potter say goodbye to your memories Obliviate! Harry Harry Ron Ron, are you ok? I'm fine Hello who are you? I'm Ron Weasley Really and who am I? Lockhart's memory charm backfired he hasn't got clue who he is it's an odd sort of place, isn't it? do you live here? no really? eh... what do I do now? you wait here and try to shift some these rocks, so we can get back through I'll go and find Ginny ok Ginny, oh, please don't be dead wake up, wake up, please wake up she won't wake Tom Tom Riddle? what do you mean she won't wake? she is not... she's still alive but only just are you a ghost? a memory, reserved in a diary for 50 years she's cold as ice Ginny, Please don't be dead wake up you got to help me, Tom, there is a Basilisk It won't come until it is called give me my wand, Tom You won't be needing it listen, we've got to go, we've got to save her I am afraid I can't do that, Harry, you see as poor Ginny growes weaker I grow stronger yes, Harry, it was Ginny Weasley who opened the chamber of secrets no, she couldn't, she wouldn't it was Ginny who set the Basilisk on mudblood and Filch's cat Ginny wrote the frighten messages on the walls why? because I told her to you'll find that I can be very persusive not that Ginny knew what she was doing, she was shall we say ,in a kind of trance still, the power of diary began to scare her she tried to dispose it in girl's bathroom and then you should find it, but you the very person I was most anxious to meet why did you want to meet me? I knew I have to talk to you meet you if I could so I desided to show you my capture of that brainless Hagrid to gain your trust Hagrid is my friend and you framed him, didn't you? it was my word to against Hagrid only Dumbledore seemed to think he was innocent but Dumbledore saw right through you he certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after that I knew it wouldn't be safe to open the chamber again while I was still at school so I desided to leave behind a diary preserving my sixteen-year-old self in its pages so that one day I would be able to lead another to finish Salazar Slytherin's noble work but you haven't finished it this time in few hours, the mandrake draught will be ready and every one who was petrified will be right to go haven't I told you? killing mudbloods doesn't matter to me any more? For many months now, my new target has been -you. how is it that a baby with no extraordinary magical talent was able to defeat the greatest wizard of all time? How did you escape with nothing but a scar while Lord Voldemort's powers were destroyed? Why do you care how I escaped? Voldemort was after your time ...... Voldemort is my past, present, and future I AM LORD VOLDEMORT you you are the heir of Slytherin you are LORD VOLDEMORT so we...you didn't think I was going to keep my filthy Muggle father's name? no I fashioned myself a new name a name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak, when I had become the greatest sorcerer in the world! Albus Dumbledore is the greatest sorcerer in the world! Dumbledore's been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me! he would never be gone. not as long as those remain loyal to him Fawkes? so this is what Dumbledore sends his defender! A songbird and an old hat! Let's match the powers of Lord Voldemort, Heir of Salazar Slytherin against the famous Harry Potter so, I have asks, Potter,no one will save you Potter,it only obeys me no your bird may have blinded Basilisk but it can still hear you yes,Potter the process is nearly complete in a few minutes Ginny Weasley will be dead and I will cease to be a memory Lord Voldemort will return very much alive Ginny remarkable, isn't it? how quickly the venom of Basilisk can penetrate the body I guess you have a little more than a minute to live you will be with your dear mudblood mother, soon, Harry funny the damage a silly little book can do especially in the hands of a silly little girl what are you doing? stop no Ginny Harry it was me I swear I didn't mean to Riddle made me Harry you are hurt Don't worry Ginny you need to get yourself out follow the chamber,and you will find Ron you were briliant, Fawkes I just wasn't quick enough of course Phoenix tears have healing powers thanks it's all right, Ginny it's over it's just memory amazing this is just like magic you both realized, of course in the past few hours you've broken perhaps a dozen school rules yes, sir there are sufficient evidence to have you expelled yes, sir yes, sir therefore it is only fitting that you will both receive special awards for services to the school thanks, sir now, Mr.Weasley if you would have an hour to deliver this release paper to Azkaban I believe we want our gamekeeper back Harry First, I want to thank you, Harry you must've shown me the real loyalty down the chamber nothing but that could have called Fawkes to you and second I sense that something is troubling you am I right, Harry? it's just you see, sir,I couldn't help but notice certain thing, certain certain similarities between Tom Riddle and me I see, well you can speak Parseltongue, ? Harry, why? because Lord Voldemort can speak Parseltongue if I am not mistaken, Harry he transferred some of his powers to you the night he gave you that scar. Voldemort transferred some of his powers to me? not intentionally but yes so the sorting hat was right I should be in Slytherin it is true, Harry it was just many qualities Voldemort himself prizes determination ,resourcefulness and if I may say so,a certain disregard for rules, why then the sorting hat placed you in Gryffindor because I asked it to exactly, Harry, Exactly it makes you different from Voldemort it is not our abilities that show what we truly are it is our choices if you want proof why you belong to Gryffindor and I suggest you look more closely at this Godric Gryffindor it'd take a true Gryffindor to pull out of that hat Dobby, so, this is your master your family you serve is Malfoy's I will deal with you later out of my way Potter so, it is true you have returned when the governors learned Arthur Weasley's daughter was taken into Chamber, they saw fit to sending me back ridiculars curiously,Lucius Several among them are under the impression that you would curse their families if they didn't want to agree to suspend me in the first place. how dare you? beg your pardon my sole concern has always been, and will always be the welfare of school and of course its students the culprit has been identified I would assume? oh, yes and who was it? Voldemort only this time he chosed to act through somebody else by means of this I see fortuanately our young Mr. Potter discovered it one hopes that no more of Lord Voldemore's old school things should find their way into innocent hands, the consequence for the one responsible would be severe well, let's just hope that Mr. Potter will always be around to save the day don't worry I will be Dumbledore come Dobby,we leave here sir, I wonder if I could have that Mr. Malfoy Mr. Malfoy I have something of yours mine? I don't know what are you talking about I think you do, sir I think you slipped the diary to Ginny Weasley's cauldron, that day in Diagon alley? do you? why don't you prove it? come, Dobby open it Dobby master has given Dobby a sock! what? I didn't master has presented Dobby with cloth Dobby is free you lost me my servant! you shall not harm Harry Potter you parents would middle some fools too mark my words, Potter one day soon, you are going to be the same, stick it Harry Potter freed Dobby How can dobby ever repay him? just promise me something anything Sir... never try to save my life again welcome back, Sir Nicholus thank you good evening, sir Nicholus good evening good to see you, sir Nicholus thank you hello Hermione welcome back thanks sir Nicholus Harry it's Hermione eh....eh... well! welcome back, Hermione it's good to be back congratulations I can't believe you solved it well, we had loads of help from you we couldn't have done it without you thanks could I have your attention please before we begin the feast let us have a round of applause for proffessor Sprout Madam Pomfrey whose mandrake juices's been sowed successfully and ministered to all who had been petrified also, in the light of recent events as a school treat all exams have been cancelled sorry I am late the owl that delivered my release papers got all lost and confused some bloody bird called Eroll I,now, just ought to say that,if it hasn't been for you, Harry and Ron and Hermione, of course I would, I'll be still, you know, where... I just like to say, thanks it's not Hogwarts without you, Hagrid
