- Okay. Detention. Necessary evil, or an outdated mode of incarceration-- Okay. In three, two... Detention. Still an important part of modern school discipline, or an antiquated vestige? From Brunswick High News, I'm Claire Mclaskey and-- No, no, no! Okay, lets start with your name. - People know me. - Totally, but for posterity. - Brooke Cabot. - And what are you in detention for? - You know how to work this thing? - I do. Yeah. The school paper got us a new camera but not new tripods. - Our school has a paper? - Yeah, a paper and a weekly news show, too. - I was in Algebra and Mr. Clark, since he's an old perv... asked me what I was doing this weekend. I said, "Your mom" and he got all flus-ltrated. - And would you say detention is worthwhile? Rehabilitation-wise? - It's a huge pain in my dick. We done, Spielsberg? - You can state your name whenever you're ready. - Uh, Mary Jane LaFont. Call me MJ. I was making out with someone in the hallway. - Oh, anyone's in particular? Or... - Yes. Darren. My boyfriend of two years, thank you very much. He's in detention across the hall. That is what you should do a story about. How the people in this town are still just as Puritan as they were when they murdered all of those witches. - Oh no, that's actually never been proven. The townspeople... - Okay. That's fine. Look, I'm just saying, why separate the boys from the girls? It is wicked sexist. - Does detention work? Will you rethink your actions in the future? - No, he's my boyfriend, I'm gonna kiss him when I want to. Besides, we're gonna get married soon and put this whole state in our rearview. - Okay. - Greta. Here because I ditched AP Chem yesterday. And there's nothing redeeming about detention. - Why'd you skip your class? - Commitments... are more important to me than neutrons. We had a game against Westbrook last night, and I've got a fullback sweeper who's been having trouble with her flick. She was worried since we wouldn't have much of a warm-up given the drive to their field, so she asked if I could give her a one-on-one refresher. - Can you say that in English? - I'm captain of the field hockey team. Those are hockey terms. - Well, did we win? Against Westbrook? - Ms. Mclaskey? - No. The Ref was an idiot. - Yeah? - How much longer will this take? - Um, I have permission from the principal to conduct these interviews - And that's why I'm allowing them. I asked you how long. - Another twenty minutes? - Make it five. - Okay. - This shouldn't be a social call. - I'm pretty much done. Unless... you'd like to say something. In the black hoodie. Sorry, I don't know your name. - Don't bother. She's new, and she doesn't talk to anybody. She just creeps around being all grim and premenstrual. I hear she worships Satan, too. Oh! - Hi. I'm Jules. I'm a Leo. I think detention is a great way to meet people. - You're kidding, right? - I'm also not new. I was born in Brunswick and just moved back. My family's been part of this town since, like, pre-Revolutionary War. - What got in detention? - Nate Aldrich? - I call him "The Groper." - He's been at it since like the third grade. - Yeah, he tried to feel me up in Physics, so I pushed him. - Wait, are you the reason he's on crutches today? - He's like over two hundred pounds. How did you you push him? - I just... believed I could. - Are you a Scientologist? - No. - I get it. It's like "The Secret" type stuff. I've been telling my teammates all about the law of attraction... how it can help us score more. All you-- - Yeah, that's not it, either. - You realize a girl like you comes along every year, right? Trying to be a witch in Brunswick is like wearing mouse ears at Disney. - Oooh. - I'm not trying to be anything. - Mission accomplished. Look, if you're not full of crap, why don't you put your superpowers to good use and get us outta here. - Okay. But you gotta believe I can. At least some of you. - I'm with you. - Me, too. - Wait. Don't do something crazy, just for the camera, because nobody watches our show. Aye si awe ten aye. Aye si awe ten aye. Aye si awe ten aye. - Oh my God. - Did you get that? Did you get that? - Gotta go, right? - Come on. Single file. - Boys, head over here. - Really? - That's awesome. - This is so cool. - Doesn't mean detention's over, ladies. Over here please. - So let me guess, you coordinated that with one of your emo friends? - Yeah, because I have so many friends to plan stuff with. - Then how did you do it? - You should know. You helped. You, too. - Because we thought you could? - Um-hmm. Exactly. You believed. Thoughts have power, especially in a group. - I've read about that theory. Like, how big groups get together and meditate on peace and it briefly lowers crime rates in the area. - Yeah, there's people who believe they can fly, too. And then they eat pavement. - This is just messing with your world-view, huh? I mean, it's warping your skinny, rich-bitch mind. - Okay, first of all, thanks for calling me skinny. And secondly, no, I don't believe anything magical happened. - Okay, well I do and I wanna learn how to do that. Like, can do that on my own? God, you scared me, dip-shits. - Um, awkward. - Um, gross. - Claire, right? - Yeah? - I'm Jason, we take trig class together. - Oh. - We're free to go. There, uh, isn't not enough time to reset the alarm so detention's over. - Really? Sweet. - Wow. Can I actually meet you at the car? We're finishing up something. - He's quite the catch. - You're damn right. Hey, how... hey! Hey, can you teach us that stuff? - If you're serious. I can try. But it's more religion than hobby, and it's not for everyone. - You said we could be more powerful in a group, right? - Um-hm. I'll be in Merrymeeting Park tonight if you're interested. At Hag's Rock. Midnight. - And it has to be midnight, because that's so much "witchier." - Midnight is transitional. And Hag's Rock is special because the places where people were brutally killed can hold onto residual energy. Any other bullshit comments? - MJ, c'mon! - Hold on! Okay, she loves a dramatic exit, doesn't she? Are you guys going? - Anything to improve my game. How 'bout you? - Me? Uh, I have to get up super early tomorrow. - She wasn't even in detention, remember? She was researching it. You shouldn't go, it won't look good on a college application. - Well that's not why, I'd-- - Brooke!? What are you doing? - Seeing how the other half lives. - C'mon. - Give me a lift, bitch. - What are you doing with those freaks? - Charity work. - Every dollar we take out of savings costs us that dollar... plus everything that dollar could have been in the future. All the dividends and interest we could've earned from now until our death. - Oh, I just love it when you talk about our deaths. - Did you send out the usual number of resumes today? - Oh, a baker's dozen. For luck. - Girls, let's eat! - Finally! - You need to remove that stuff. - Yeah, okay, just a sec. Claire says this thing keeps tipping over on her. - Ooh, smells good. Any luck? - Sure. Just had a screw loose, like your mother. - Hey! - You know this is what I always wanted to do, really... - Yeah? - Something with my hands. - Looks del-licious, mom. - Good. Dig in. - How'd I ever let myself get caught up in network administration? Take it from me, girls-- - Emily, - Don't let fear stop you from doing things. - did you wash your hands? - She didn't. - Try everything once. - Even d-d-drugs? - You're an idiot. Dad, do you know you're recording? - Huh? ♪♪ - Detention voice-over. Take one. The dictionary describes detention as the act of restraining a thing-- - You're the last one up. - Okay. I'll set the alarm. Okay, don't work too much longer, honey. It's almost midnight. - Benefit of having trusting parents, they never expect you to be irresponsible. Not that big of a deal, I'm sixteen, my peers are doing way worse things. Who's there? - Ha! - What is wrong with you? - Sorry. Did I frighten you on your way to becoming a witch? - I was just... out... walking. - Very close to Merrymeeting Park. - Well I was curious if anyone would show. - Well, let's be curious together. - No, thanks. - What's your deal, Miss Priss? You live life through a camera? - I report things, perhaps you've heard of it? - I remember you, by the way. Weren't you that girl in sixth grade who wrote our congressman and got like bullet proof vests for police dogs? - Why would you remember that? - Because I thought it was cool. I'm not a sandpaper tampon, you know. - I don't know. We've never spoken. - But I bet you've heard things. Oh, come on. Hearing the rumors about me is one of my few joys. - I heard you got a nose job the summer before freshman year. - Best money my dad ever spent. - Does he make a lot? - Whatever he makes now he spends on his new family. My mom got a pretty huge settlement, but she like pretty much drank the entire thing away, so... - I'm sorry. - You're not pouring chardonnay down her throat. - Well either way, you're cool... top of the local food chain. Why are you interested in this? - Even if it's a big cauldron of BS, it'll make a good story. And if it's not... I'll be able to slap hexes on the people I hate. Oooh. - So it is happening. - Yep. - Right on. - It's this or Netflix. - Well get in. - Did someone die and leave you this car? ...On a scale of one to Columbine, how crazy is this Jules person? - Oh, she's harmless. - Can we make Columbine jokes now? - It's ten after. Either we missed the world's shortest ritual, or the stupid witch lied to us. - You're late. - What did we miss, organic farming? - Claire, I'm okay with you filming this, but only if you participate. If you just observe, it'll stanch the energy flow. We wouldn't want that. - Hey, what's your malfunction? If you're drinking, stop. Or leave. Your desire and intention need to be crystal clear. - Wait. Brooke? - Let her go. - Relax. I'm draining the weasel. - Looks kinda... Satanic. - Satanists use the pentagram with its two points up, representing devil's horns. Which is why people think that witches worship Satan... they're looking at it wrong. From where I'm standing, it symbolizes the four primal elements earth, wind, fire, and water. - What's the fifth? School spirit? - You're actually close for once. It's just Spirit, it represents those who've lived before us and passed on... since their energy can never truly be extinguished. Grab a tool and dig a hole at one of the five points. Then we'll cut off a lock of hair, and bury it as an offering. - I don't think extensions count. - Um, I don't think you count. - I came up here in fifth grade once for a field trip. - Oh yeah. Me too. - Hold still. - Is anyone else getting eaten alive? - These instructions have been in my family for generations. - What are those? Spells? - Two chants. One of which we'll do tonight, is called "Bonding." It's a way of sealing a group of like-minded souls. - Hate to break it to you, but we couldn't be more different. - We're all here, aren't we? - What do you mean chants? - Words we say in unison. It's a way of focusing a coven's intention. - Is that what we are? A coven? - Not yet. By the air of our breath. The fire in our blood. The water of our wombs. The earth in our bodies. May this circle be sanctioned, welcomed, and bonded. - Are these like, Girl Scout cookies or did you get them from the store? - I think just from the store. - How long should we give it? - Doesn't say. Maybe it's dumb to wait. Maybe it's not that literal. - Well, Claire? You said that the town didn't really burn witches here? - From what I've read, yeah. It's well documented that these woods were used as a meeting place for Pagan and Wiccan ritual practices, hence the term, Merrymeeting Park. - Did you just say "hence"? - And it's true that several women died here in late 1600's, pre Salem Witch Trials. But diaries of the town Pastor and local officials say that they were found dead at Hag's Rock. - And history remembers them as witches when they were probably just, like, outspoken women. - Right? Like, they just mentioned to the mens folk a few things that could've been run better around town and then... whuddya know... were later found decapitated. - I always try to remember the one bright spot. Mary Perkins. She was found among the dead... cold and shivering with rope burns around her neck but she was still alive. - Really? I don't know about her. - Well did she ever say what happened? - No. She was unable to speak because of the damage to her throat, so they jailed her for the murders. Later she escaped and blamed the town. Said they tried to form a mob and tried to kill them. - I'm with her. This town blows. - Holy crap. - MJ, did you tell Darren you were coming up here? - No. - Check it out! - Oh my God. - Where's our hair? - That is messed up. - Were any of you followed? - Ah, man. We should leave. Now. - Guys. Didn't we want something to happen? - So the hunter has become the hunted. Tell us, how does it feel to be on camera, Claire? - She plans on being a national news anchor, Pete. I think she's fine. - You're not filming over anything I've already shot, right? - I'm not a complete idiot. Hey, that detention story, can you get it to me tomorrow, before press-time? - Uh, it's kinda become a bigger deal. - I know you're gunning for a Pulitzer Prize, but we have a quota-- - Give it. Eating alone. - Mm-hmm. - Is this by choice? - Everything you say sounds like a news teaser. Dining solo... tonight at eleven. - Is it weird for you to be back? I mean, are any of your friends still around? - Nah, it's been too long. - Well, you could've sat with me. - I'm okay with not having friends. You're in my History class, right? - Mrs. Fuller's? - Mm-hmm. - That's awful, especially since I pride myself on being observant. - To be fair... this is a new do. - Okay, so someone must have been screwing with us last night, right? - How did they know where to dig? - Uh, they were watching us from the woods. - Okay, it says here that, if our coven were deemed worthy, our offerings would then be-- - Darren. Don't-- - What's so important you can't sit with me, babe? - Just leave it. - Give it. - You plannin' some kinda medieval surprise party for me? - Hand it over. - Ow. I'm just foolin'. - Darren, just go sit, I'll join you in a minute. - MJ, c'mon. - Darren. Sit! - Hey Claire, you crack that trig homework? - I haven't even started it. - It's next period. - I work fast. - Did he rip it, Jules? - Its fine. - Okay. Awesome. Well I feel super dumb. - What a douche. - You better not mean my Darren. - What if I do? - Hey Brooke, you wanna sit with me? - No, I have a seat already. - You guys, here comes Brooke. - It's like, you're obviously horrific looking. Why do you think you can speak to me? - Brooke, what do you think happened last night? - I know what happened. it worked. Right? - Mm-hmm. - Our offers were accepted. - So what happens now? - The second chant is called "Commencement." - There's nothing else on there? - It's torn off. I mean, there might have been something, but... - So let's do it, let's commence. - Do you wanna sit? - No. I have an image to protect. But we can use my house. My mom will be out. Eleven pm? - Can't we just meet after school? Sneaking out really isn't easy for me. - I got a game, then after that all the varsity teams are decorating the gym for the Spring Fling. - Guys, I can't. - What? C'mon. - I'm sorry, am I the only one who couldn't sleep last night? I thought this is something I wanted but... I'm sorry. - So, you're just pussing out? - Look, I don't know where it comes from. The magic. I don't want to be in league with like some demon or something. - You're not. We're tapping into natural vibrations. - But from where? - All around. Nature. The sky. Even spirits of past witches. - So ghosts? That's comforting. - Look, MJ, I can't tell you not to bail, but we're bonded now. If you decide not to commence, then there is no coven. - Don't let Brooke pressure you into becoming a witch. - I just, I just don't want to disappoint anyone. - Not a sentence I thought I'd ever say. - It's a manual ISO? - Yeah, I think so. - And it shoots 4K, right? - Hey, move it, Tech Support. - But that's where I always sit. - You did. Before I wanted to. - That was mean. - How well do you know MJ? - As well as you do. - We have to make sure she grows a pair before tonight. - Miss Cabot? - Mr. Dwyer? - Why must you insist on speaking during my lectures? - Why do you lecture during my conversations? - Comedian. Alright class, page 39. - Oh, please. - Edgar Allen Poe. - This helps to purify ourselves as well as the space. - Hey, we totally Febreze. I mean an energetic purification. The base energy here is very selfish. Shallow even. Now I'm casting the circle, like I did with the salt in the forest. There's a belief that once cast, this becomes a place where time doesn't exist. - Like Mr. Dwyer's class. - Oops. - That can't be the fire department, again, right? - Hi. If I ever do quit, it will not be because I'm scared. - Right on. - Alright. We got ourselves a coven. - Brooke? Shining moon. Darksome night. Harken to the witches rite. Hear us gods of land and sea, assist our shadow family. Use the strength of your creation, to grant us five this embarkation. - Was that it? - Well, what'd you expect? A laser show? - I don't know, I thought something would happen. - Let's just try something. Like a spell or whatever. - But there were only two chants on the paper, right? - Forget the paper, it's up to us now. I didn't use it when I did the fire alarm at school. - Yeah, how did you do that? - I came up with a mantra about wanting it to happen... repeated it, and it centered me. - So what'll be our first thing? Levitate this book. Levitate this book. Levitate this book-- - Okay, what are we doing wrong? - Asking questions instead of concentrating? - It could be a lot of things, some doubt floating around, the way we're phrasing it... - The book is already in the air. - The book's already in the air. The book's already in the air. The book's already in the air. The book's already in the air. The book's already in the air. The book's already-- - MJ! Come on. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. This is freakish! I mean, this doesn't happen in real life, right? - You wanted us to believe the book was already floating. That's smart. - Right. There's no reason to doubt what we want, because... it's already happened. - Okay, so... we've already done the book. Claire is in the air. Claire is in the air. Claire is in the air. Claire is in the air. Claire is in the air. Claire is in the air. Claire is in the air. Claire is in the air. Claire is in the air. Claire is in the air. Claire is in the air. - Watch the hands, buster. - What the... - Claire is in the air. - 'Sup, ladies? Looks like I hit the jackpot. - Brooke, honey, you didn't tell me about a sleep-over. - It's a study group, Mom, and I did. Check your phone. - Whatever, okay, just keep it down here. We're gonna be upstairs. - Whatever. Claire is in the air. Claire is in the air. Whoa! - Oh my God. - Claire? - Claire, are you ok? - Claire? - Claire? - Are you ok? - Oh my God. - Oh my God, I was trying to keep her up there myself. - We got beyond lucky. - Which was good because it created some construction jobs. That's what people needed, jobs. But he did want to avoid raising government-- - ...Boundaries which divide life from death are at best shadowy and vague. Isn't that cool? - The North American Teenage Witch in her natural habitat... texting. Those new glasses? - New prescription. - They're cool. - Greta, how 'bout you save some food for us. Signed, the rest of the world. - If I wanted to be a skinny witch, I would be. Also, I got a big game coming up. - Against who? - MJ can't make it. She's at a last minute dental appointment. - What? - Girl's gotta get her priorities straight. - I say we try a little something without her. - Can we? - Maybe. - Seriously!? Ladies, you can't camp out here. I have other hungry customers waiting. - How rude is that? - Uh, very. - The bill's already been paid. The bill's already been paid. The bill's already been paid. - With a generous tip. - The bill's already been paid. - With a generous tip. - The bill's already been paid. - With a generous tip. - So, I'll get you some change. - Uh, no. All set. - Thank you, ladies. - Whoa! - So, do we just get up and--? - Leave. - I think we do. Oh my God. That was awesome! - Maybe I don't need that part-time job, after all. - Anyone else thinking what I'm thinking? - Shopping spree? - Mm-hmm. - Wait, what was that? How'd it work? I mean, we didn't just create money. - She seems to think we did. - Yep. - But what happens to that waitress at the end of her shift? Does she just come up thirty-six dollars short? - You're over-thinking it. - Am I? Or am I just thinking? - You can find me in the Old Port. - Right behind ya. Here you go. - I really do need new shoes. For field hockey. Don't judge me. - I didn't say a thing! Oh man. ♪♪ - Claire. Say hi. - Hey. - C'mon. - You should get that. This is too much for one person to document. - The dark side looks good on you, Claire. She's already paid. She's already paid. She's already paid. She's already paid. She's already paid-- - Hey! - Oh no. - You wanna get coffee sometime, or...? No, sorry. - Ladies, what's with all the bags? - You guys win a contest? - No, people just like giving us things. - Have you talked to MJ? She's in a world of hurt. Had a double root canal and a bridge. - Oh, no, I guess we didn't think to follow up with her. - Rolling? Okay, My lipstick is Makeup Forever and in my hair is Amika's Undone texture spray. And my handkerchief dress is-- - What're you doing? - Um, hello? Making a haul video. You don't do a spree like this without putting it up on YouTube-- - Miss Cabot. Here we are again. Since you're so talkative today, why don't you give the class an example of Edgar Allen Poe's "Single Effect?" Please. - Sure. He was such a creepy mo-fo. that it effected his dating life and he stayed single. - That's clever. That's really clever, but your witticisms aren't going to help you on the mid-term. - Poe basically thought stories were best when they achieved a single emotional effect on the reader. - That's correct, Ms. Mclaskey. Again, thank you very much. Brooke, I'm wondering what you're going to do, when your smarter friend isn't around to help you? Now I'm gonna read from "Masque of the Red Death," I want you guys to pay close attention to the signposts. Okay? - Stay out of it. - I just wanted him off your back. - You only made it worse. - Good? No? Great. - Dwyer's a coffee-mouth. -"No pestilence has ever been so fatal. - Dwyer's a coffee-mouth. - Dwyer's a coffee-mouth. - Dwyer's a coffee- mouth. - Dwyer's a coffee-mouth. - "Blood was its avatar and its seal-- - Dwyer's a coffee- mouth. - Dwyer's a coffee- mouth. - Dwyer's a coffee-mouth. - Dwyer's a coffee-mouth. - The redness and the horror of blood..." - Dwyer's a coffee- mouth. - Dwyer's a coffee-mouth. - Um... "There were sharp pains, - Oh my God. - and there were sudden bleeding at the pores--" - Poe's single effect. - I heard about this all the way on the tennis courts. - I almost felt bad for him. - Claire. It's Dwyer. I mean, I hear he's some kind of shell-shocked ex- Marine. - Yeah. He hates my guts, and he's my advisor, too. So he's literally doing everything in his power to make sure I end up working at McDonalds. - Oh no. - Enjoying the plight of Dwyer? I just came from the nurse's office. He's not vomiting up Folgers anymore. - That's good. - How are you? - I'm okay. My teeth went ape-shit. - Yeah, we heard. - But, hey, how are you guys? Miss a day and miss a lot, huh? Raiding the Old Port actually sounds pretty rad. Wish I could've been there. But apparently we don't need all of us together to do spells or whatever. - Yeah. Just two of you did Dwyer. - I think we're each capable of harnessing the power of the entire coven now. At any time. - Brett Harlow asked me to the Spring Fling. - Shut the front door. - What? - Is that something you chanted for? - No. I beat him at tennis during gym class and then when we shook hands after, he asked me. - I figured he was gay... he never looks at me. - Uh, he's like, Beiber-licious. You know what, no, no, I actually think he's prettier than Justin Beebs. - Alright, witches. We all have things that we all want, right? And I'm not just talking about shopping anymore. I think this group should be about helping each other get what we want. So let's meet tonight with lists. - Let me guess, midnight? - Greta's pretty good, huh? - She's great. I never cared about any of our sports because I never knew any of the players. - Hey, uh I'm walkin' home. Wanna join? - Has the town changed a lot since you were last here? - Yeah, somehow its even lamer. - What does that say about me that I like it? - It says that you're a Labra-Doodle. - Hold up. Say that again? - Not while you're recording. - Claire just explained to me why witches ride brooms. - A theory I read. That's all. - They were drug addicts? Okay, there's this mold that grows on really old rye bread. And if you eat it, you hallucinate, but if you swallow too much, than you'll die. So to get the fun effects without the danger, you can let it seep through your bloodstream via... another area. - Oh, like your vagina! - Well they may have wiped the mold on things like broom handles, and rubbed it between their legs. Hence the reports of ladies in fields "riding" their brooms. - Gross. I'd at least have the decency to do that indoors. - So, what happens if your parents catch you sneaking out at night? - That would be really creepy because they're both dead. - Oh, man. Open mouth, insert foot. - Nah. It's ancient history. At the moment I'm living with foster parents who are-- - Get off her! - What're you doing? Let me go. - Hey! - Oh. - Let's make sure she's not following us. - What the hell was that? That was insane? - Should we call the cops? How is it, are you okay? - Yeah, just... freaked out. How'd you do that? - I dunno. I just... wanted her away from you and suddenly she was. - Wow. Reflex. - Yeah. - 1971. Stanford University. An experiment, divided students into two groups, prisoners and guards. Those acting as guards soon became so abusive, the experiment was terminated. What would stop the same thing from happening, say, to a teacher asked to preside over high school detention? The psychologist who created the experiment, was quoted as saying, "Only a few people were able to resist "the situational temptations to yield to power and dominance." - Ha! - Remember our talk, about knocking? - My name is Emily, and I enjoy l-l-long walks on the b-beach. - Emily!? - A-are you m-m-making a sex-tape? - No! You're gross. Get out! - I see Claire's working, have you done your homework? - Kinda. N-no. - Go. - Yeah, go. - I'll g-get you in your sleep. - Are you pulling another late one? - Have to. Hey, um... could they've messed up my glasses? - What're you talking about? - At the lens place or whatever? - Why? - Why's she waiting outside? - Hey girl, what's up? - We need a new locale. My mom's has that same ass-clown over again. - Gross. - Get your ass in the car. - Okay, lists. Who has one? - Jules? Now you're filming, too? - Mm-hmm. - You created a monster. - Just read your list. - Okay. Number one. Darren proposes to me. - Aw. - Aw. C'mon. - What!? - He's gonna do that anyway! - I don't know. He's talkin' about the Army after school. Life could pull him in all sorts of directions. - That's not a bad thing. That's life. - You said make a list! - What else is on there? - Thank you. Thighs. Butt. Boobs. That's the big one. - Okay, I got food. Y'all witches ready to eat? I wanna beat Westbrook tomorrow. - Won't that happen anyway? - They got this new goalie. She's like a brick wall. But if we beat them, we can make it all the way to State. Oh, and another thing, I want a new car. Since I keep driving around this cracker-ass coven like some kinda Driving Miss Daisy sequel. - They have their own trailer, and they feed them like, filet mignon. So what if, on the way to one of these shows, the Dobermans just... turned on her? Bit her in the face? - I'm not chanting for show dogs to kill your dad's girlfriend. - Who said kill? I'm just talking a few nips to the head and neck, some light scarring, maybe a temporary eye patch. I also want my mom to lay off the booze. It's outta control. - ...Turn this thing on? Oh, wait I got it. - Claire, you're such a girl scout! - What? - Oh, come on. Nothing for yourself? Just a job for dear 'ol dad and no stuttering for little sister? - Guys, I really thought about what would make my life better. And it's these two things, trust me. - Jules, how about you? What do you want? - First thing on my list is to fly. - Whoa. Can we really? - We're witches. - What's the second? - At this year's Spring Fling, I want to be crowned Flower Queen. What? It's never someone like me. It's always some stuck-up bulimic bitch. - Um, it was me last year? But you really think I could pass for bulimic? Wow. Thank you. - I just think it'd be cool for people on the fringes. - That'd be a big spell, right? The entire school would have to think you're the best candidate. That doesn't feel right. It's like giving everyone a date rape drug. - Whoa. Way to make it awkward. - Yeah, who made you Spell Sheriff? - No one. And we've proven that it doesn't take all of us to make stuff happen, so I can go. - No, don't be like that. - Well, there's just things that I think we should mess with. Like hurting people, or performing psychic surgery on our bodies. I at least propose that if anyone has a any body image things on their list... we table 'em for now. - So my entire list, basically. - Ah, really? All of us? - I'm supposed to meet Darren later, so I'd rather not sit around here chanting all night. - Alright. How about we limit this first session to two things each. Would that un-knot your panties? - It might. - And I don't want the dog attack anymore, I thought of something better. I want Dwyer off my back. - You know, Claire, I'm not asking for the whole school to love me... just vote for me and put that stupid tiara on my head. - It's up to you, Claire. Walk away, or get that job for your dad. - Oh, can I do the flying thing, too? - Sure, if you want. - Yes! - In Dwyer's eyes, Brooke can do no wrong. - In Dwyer's eyes Brooke can do no wrong. In Dwyer's eyes, Brooke can do no wrong. In Dwyer's eyes, Brooke can do no-- - I know how to work a camera! - You apparently don't. The SD card is full. You're recording over our chanting. ...Karen Cabot hates the taste of alcohol. Karen Cabot hates the taste of alcohol. Karen Cabot hates the taste of-- - Look it's fine. - It's not fine. - It's fine-- - Woo-hoo! - ...Goalie can't block the shots. Westbrook's goalie can't block the shots. Westbrook's goalie can't block the shots. - Whoo! - Holy crap! - You alright!? - That was awesome! I was spinning a lot, but you guys have to-- - MJ, what is it? - Did you land on your face!? - Is that a tooth? - Did you hit something in the air? - Were you going too fast? - No. - Like, G-forces or whatever? - No. - We're close. Hang in there. - She has bad teeth. I mean, she just had major dental surgery, right? So maybe flying around up there, the air pressure wasn't good. - The Doc wants a dental specialist to check her out tomorrow, but they've stopped the bleeding. - Thank goodness. - I can't believe this happened. Tonight of all nights. - Is that what I think it was? - If so... that means that-- - We'll be getting everything we asked for tonight. - I mean, hope MJ's okay, but that's awesome! - I'm waiting for Brooke because Dwyer asked to see her after class. I couldn't tell if he was mad, or what. - What!? No way. - Dude, and that's not even the best part. He says his dad sits on the admissions board for Princeton or some crap. And now he's going to do whatever he can to help get me in. - Whoa. No McDonald's for you. We'll see. For this to work it needs to last, ya know? Not like the coffee-mouth spell. - The chanting we do as an entire coven must be stronger. More permanent. - You talk out of your ass a lot, but always make it seem legit. That will help you with two things, becoming a newscaster... and walking backwards into people. - Oh my God. I'm-- I'm sorry. - Hey, no worries. I was actually hoping to bump into you. Did you guys hear what happened to MJ? Something about her jaw bone deteriorating. - Too much flapping. - Brooke? - I'm kidding. Jeez. - What are you up to tonight? There's a party up at Topsham Lake. - I'm conditioning my hair. - Do you know how to get up there? - Who doesn't? - Apparently Brooke can tell me. - Well, consider yourself invited. Things don't usually get going 'till around ten. - That's not even something I witched for. - Yeah. Well, don't get too excited. He's probably gay for Darren and looking for a beard. - Okay... - Hey, is this a zit, or the start of something much more serious? - Go Greta! - Go, go, go. - Yeah! - Oh my God, that goalie is so pissed. - Brunswick! Brunswick! Ay, Ay, Ay! - Shut up. - This can't be hers. - It's nicer than my house. - Oh my God. - I wanted the SUV, but guess I can settle for the coupe. That's my car! That's my car! - You're ridiculous. - My car! - This is amazing. - She's not responding to texts. - Hmm, Skype her again. - MJ? It's your coven calling. - Just wanted to see how you're doing. - We don't care what you look like. - If you care at all, leave me alone. - Is she mad at us, or just life in general? - Brooke, Honey, do you want a smoothie? - Sure. She didn't drink last night for the first time in, oh, a decade. And then today she's Wonder Mom. Ironing, baking, cleaning. It's amazeballs. Hey, can you guys hear me okay? - Uh-huh. - Claire! Come here! - Oh, that must be dinner. - I'll pick you up at eleven. We're gonna have fun tonight. - The pork chops must be really good. - Claire, come over here. - What's up? - Listen to me. I just got not one... but two job offers. - For real? - I'm so proud of you, dad. - Emily? I mean, you deserve to be working. You care and you're responsible and... - What the hell? - Where is my stutter? How am I doing this? - Man. I've only had this car a day and I'm already doing it grievous bodily harm. - Jules didn't wanna come? - No, she said she might catch up with us later. Oh, here we go. - Whoa. - I'm not saying this is the first party I've ever been to but it is the first that doesn't require a party hat. So... Any tips? What's the protocol here? - Um... be yourself? - Hey Claire, you know that feeling when you're with a group of people but you just feel kinda alone... as if, somehow, everyone can sense you're just a little worm inside? - Wow. Yeah. - Yeah, stop doing that. C'mon. - Brooke's not actually going to do a keg stand, right? - Yeah, I think she is. - Oh my gosh. - Drink it, drink it, drink it. - I see you. I see you - Claire, you made it. - I did. - This is like, how do I focus? Ah, there we go. Breaking news, Claire's about to have her first sip of beer ever. - Well, I'm not gonna do it now. - You of all people don't want the loss of your beerginity documented? - Okay, well, my dad's latest advice was to "Try everything once." - Smart man. Oh... - That was... super classy. - It's called celebrating, Claire. You should try it sometime. - You're celebrating your mom's sobriety, by getting drunk? - Hey, when the keg's dry, is that it? Or is there a secret stash somewhere? - I'm sure somebody's got something. Did you try asking around? -Claire? - No. - Have you meet Brett? - Hey. No. I've seen you around. - Yeah, same. - I'll find your friend some beer, but then I wanna show you the lake. - Okay. - Whoo! - Here, your turn. C'mon, try it. - Even if you think you've met uncoordinated people... they pale in comparison to me. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Less talking. More hitting. - Spread your legs a little more. - Choke up on the stick a bit. - That's what she said. - Okay, let me try another one. Nope, even worse. I tried. - I'm outta cans. - Jason? Jason? Jason, are you down here? Hello? Jason is that you? Holy shit! - Your theory was wrong, by the way. - Which one? - Riding on something, a broom or whatever, it stabilizes you. I think that's what messed up MJ. Oh, so there's this food truck in Cambridge that has the most amazing scallion pancake sandwiches in the world. - Cambr... You flew all the way to Boston? - Yeah. I got four, so where my coven at? - Look who blew in. - Oh, hey girl, what's going on? - Can we steal you away for a sec? Hey, have you seen Brooke Cabot? Tall. Blonde. Too thin for her boobs? - I don't know, somewhere over there. - Into the darkness? - Hey Donnie, can you turn the lights on? - What the hell, people!? - Really? - All right then. - You trifling. - No, it was deliberate. She knew I was excited about Jason. - I know. How could she not. - ...Much of what they have today, is because they snatched up farms, and the homes, and the labor of people who could not afford to pay their loans. Excuse me. - Did you see her this morning? - No and I don't want to. There's Brooke can say that's going this better. - Claire? - Sorry, we were just talking-- - Claire, I need you and Jules to step out into the hall, please? - Hi, girls. I'm sorry to pull you from class. I'm Detective Strauss, this is Officer-- - Is that recording? - Yes. And it's going to stay that way. We're on public property, so I don't need to-- - That's okay. It's about time I got on YouTube anyway. So, you girls were shopping in the Old Port last Saturday, you left Kurier with some new handbags and clothing. Would you happen to have the receipts? - Is there a problem with them? - Security footage shows you just... walking out. Not paying. - What about the cashier? - He says you paid. - Because we did. - Cash or credit? - Credit. - Cash. - The drawer came up short, and the owner's a friend of mine. - Let me get this straight? If you're tight with some local detective, you can have girls harassed because of a bookkeeping issue? - See, now I'm surprised this is unpleasant. I thought you'd clear this up quickly. - It's perfectly clear. We paid. - Brooke? Hi. I just wanted to tell you how impressed and stunned really I am with your turnaround. - I know, right? It's like magic. - What I can't really figure out is, um... is if you feel the same way? - What? - I know some might say it's wrong, but in my eyes, Brooke... you can do no wrong. - He's fired? Brooke turned him in? - Turned himself in. Said he couldn't believe what he'd done. He even cried. - Oh man. He wasn't a bad teacher. - I know. He's married too, and he has a new baby. Oh hey, I have MJ's homework. So I was thinking we could drop it by, but-- where are you? - I'm at another eye exam. For some reason my glasses got screwed up in the mail or something-- - Claire, as I was just telling your mother, the glasses are fine. The problem is something I don't know how I missed last time. The medical term is macular degeneration. - Wait. Isn't that what Grandma had? Go, Greta! - Make a break! - Way to go ladies! - Yeah! - Greta is on fire today, Kev. - Isn't she? I wish I had half her skills. - I don't know what happened. It's my knee. - I wasn't sure about my theory 'till Greta texted me on the way over. "Bad fall at the away game. "Knees killing me. "Team doc says early onset arthritis. W.T.F." - What? - It means, "What the F." - I know what W.T.F is. I just didn't hear the last part. - She's seventeen and has arthritis. Just like how my eyes are somehow rotting as if I'm ninety. - MJ's teeth. - Exactly. I think the spells are somehow... costing us our youth. - I can't hear for shit lately. - I mean, this would explain why witches look so old and ugly... white hair, hunched over-- - You look fine. - Well I've been getting hot flashes. My Gyno didn't necessarily say "menopause," but he prescribed hormones... he seemed pretty shocked. - We need to stop and hope the effects reverse or wear off. - I don't know. - You don't know? - Yeah, Claire. That okay with you? - No, actually, it's not. We're linked. Bonded, right? If one of us is using, we could all pay the price. - Is that true? Does the magic need our health to work? Like we're batteries or whatever? - I don't know, I've never been in a coven before. - So maybe you're wrong, Claire. Look, I just got my mom back, and it feels good. If we stop, and she starts hitting the bottle, you can bet I'll start chanting for it again right away. - Even if it ages us? Or kills us? - You don't know how it works, so don't go policing me as if you do. - Maybe he's waking her up or something? - She says, thank you for the homework, but please go away. Alright. - Okay, two lemonades. Jules, you said no ice? - Yes. Thanks, Mr. Thompson. - All right. - Hey, there... she is. - Do you think she'll stop? - I don't know. She walked out on us. - I didn't need the things I wished for. My life was really good. But now-- Your dad got his job, right? And your sister stopped stuttering? Maybe the nice things you did will help reverse the effects. Do you think that could happen? - Hello. Well, this is getting interesting. - Can I help you? - Oh, I'm Detective Strauss. Hello Jules, Claire. You must be Greta, right? Is that your BMW? - No. - No? Didn't you drive that off the Lee Automotive lot? - I-- I don't remember. - Salesman there said you paid for it in one lump sum. - Then why're you bothering her? - Because there's no record of the trans-- - Please. Just take it back. - Believe it or not, I've seen this kinda thing before. - You found the car, detective. Bravo. Mystery solved. - Seventeen years ago a different group of girls at Brunswick High-- - Claire, we don't need to listen to this. - I'll be in in a minute. - Fine - I never could figure what those girls were into, but they collected a whole heap of things that didn't belong to them. It ended badly. - Hello? What's this about? - Uh, friendly chat. - May I see some identification? - No, not necessary. I was just leaving. - I just left Greta's and I'm having this feeling. Like I'm being watched. I don't know if it's from talking to the detective or-- - Hey. - What the-- Were you following me? - No. I know you live around here, I was actually hoping to run into you. Hey, can I say something? Can I say something off the record? - This helps me maintain an emotional distance. So let's keep it that way. - Look, what happened at the lake last night... that was a surprise to me, too. Okay? My plan was to actually see if you'd be my date to the Spring Fling tomorrow night. - Terrible timing. I'm now a lesbian. - Is that's supposed to be a deterrent? Look, okay, I won't get into who kissed who first, it was dumb, and I regret it. Would you give me a chance to make it up to you? - Look, you seem like a great guy but-- - Uh-oh. That's like starting a sentence, "With all due respect." - But I'm just, I'm dealing with a lot of heavy stuff right now. - Anything I can lift for you? - I've seen the way you pick things up, so no thanks. - Well, if you get your stuff figured out by tomorrow, call me? Please? Pretty please? - We chant for our powers to go away. For everything to return to normal. - And where does the energy for that spell come from? I mean, it could make us sicker, right? - We go to Hag's Rock tonight, because it's a powerful place... and we chant to diminish just Brooke's ability. - Yeah, I just... I don't know. - There has to be a way to unlink ourselves, to reverse the bonding. - You really don't trust Brooke? - I do actually and she was very clear about not stopping and doing anything to keep her powers. - Hello? - What is that? Are your foster parents home? - Is anyone there? - Jules! Mom! - Thank God she's in one piece, and we pray they find the responsible party very soon. Yeah. Take care. She's in the hospital, but she's-- - Can one of you drive me? - Not now. - Mom! - Claire. Her father said she can't be seen till tomorrow. - Foster father. - We gotta respect his wishes, sport. - He sounded so weird. Zombie-like. - Well, I'd be a mess too, if someone came into this house attacked one of you. - How did Hoover respond to the Great Depression? Well he did a few things. One was a big PR move. He downplayed public fears by keeping confidence in the economy up and then he tried to get across this idea of... - So is the detention story not happening? - Okay Claire, how 'bout this? Turn in any story, at all. You can even review what passes for food here. - Okay, when you get sick of Pete why don't you come work with me on the yearbook. I'm basically putting it together myself. - Oh my God, I'm so sorry. I'm scared. And I don't even know who I can turn to for help-- - The last one, Claire, was Sutton? - Yeah. Jules Sutton. - That name is as old as the hills. One of the original Brunswick settlement families, if I'm not mistaken. - Yeah, she did say they've been around awhile. - Well, you are a good friend to pick up their homework. - I'm on my way to visit Jules and I swear, I swear someone's watching me. Hey, you stay away from me! Hi, sorry, is that Jules' room? - Yes. She's in there. And we really love her so very much. - So, so much. - I'm-- I'm sure you do. Thanks. - Hey. - Hey. The paper called it a random home invasion? - I couldn't think of anything else to tell the cops. Me and that thing wrestled for awhile until it pushed me out the window. And when I landed... I found this in my fist. Which friendly blonde does that remind you of? - You think that thing was Brooke? - Or something she conjured? - Yeah, but to what end? I mean, why? - What if, with us out of the way and too sick to fight... she kept practicing magic? Just watch your back, Claire. If she put me in the hospital... why stop there? - It's eleven. I'm too afraid to sleep. Does Brooke want power that badly? I mean, she's not what I'd call "loyal", but I wouldn't've thought that-- - Hey, can we talk? - Okay. - You gonna let me in or...? - It's late. Here's fine. - I can hardly hear you. Let's walk at least. If anything happens to me... Brooke Cabot is responsible. Make she who looks not see me... when I say "invisibility." Make she who looks, not see me when I say-- I'm leaving behind the last chuck of footage I've shot. For evidence. - Claire? That you? - Yeah, just... setting the alarm. - I now understand that saying, "Cold as a witch's tit." Mine are about to snap off. - That's what you wanted to talk about? The weather? - So, where to? - Lead the way. - So, you mad about the Jason thing? - Who? - Oh, come on. - Yeah, I thought it was lame. I also don't think it matters right now. - Crazy what happened to Jules. - She'll pull through. - Should I be worried? - That she'll pull through? - No, that it had something to do with our coven. - You tell me. - Like I said, I'm losing my hearing... that sounded like, "You tell me." Look, Claire, I've always hated the way girls fight. All innuendo and shit. I'd rather things just come to blows so I know where I stand. - Invisibility. - Clever. Thought we weren't doing magic anymore, Claire. Thought the price was too high. Here's a tip. If you're gonna disappear, drop the camera. - Invisibility. Dammit. - Semi-permanent, like your dye job. Girls everywhere, some free advice, don't trust your friends. Claire? You get that lightning is shooting outta my finger tips, right? And you're hiding behind a propane truck? - I'm not afraid of you, Brooke. And you can't surprise me like you did Jules. - What's that? Reverse psychology? Oh, whoa. That's big of you, Claire. - Brooke, I don't wanna hurt you. I just want you to stop. Oh, you finally have a friend you can be loyal to. - You-hoo! We done? - You trying to put me in the hospital, too? - What're you talking about? - You... attacking Jules. - Nice redirect. I woke up this morning with the word "Slut" all over my skin. Tiny tattoo's that took forever to wash off. - I didn't put any words on you. Jules had some of your hair from wrestling with you. - My hair? I didn't wrestle with-- The only hair I left behind was what we buried. - Possible for us to come see you? - In here. - How's now? Okay. - You sure about this? - No. Come on. I guess we went a bit too far? - Holy Cruella de Vil. Here, zoom in on my stigmata. What would you call that? Because I might call that a witch's wart. Let's never fight again, huh? - Hey, I just thought of something. Your hearing, my crappy vision... but what did Jules say her issue was? - It was like, uterus stuff, right? It was all internal. Stuff we could only take her word for. - There you are. She'll see you now. - Some wild reports from the village center tonight. Lot like the calls I heard come in seventeen years ago. So why the sudden interest in those girls I mentioned? - You said it ended badly? - Three of them are dead... the other two missing, presumed dead. - There were five of them. Like us. Hey, any clearer ones of her? - Not really. There's that... and this one. Abby Butcher. One of the missing. I tried to get more info from next of kin, but she was a foster kid and frankly, nobody seemed to care that she was gone, so... It's been a cold case around here for everyone but me. - So why do you stick with it? - It's my job. That's Lisa Strauss. She's been missing since 1983, when she got involved with another group of girls who used to gather up at Hag's Rock. - She's a Strauss, too? - She's my older sister. - Isn't that, like, a conflict of interest or something? - Would you rather no one be working on this case? - Guess I'm okay with it. - Well that's a load off. - Hey, take away this bad haircut and replace it with a try-hard hombre dye job, and who do you have? - What? She would've been, a baby back then. - Okay, who're we talking about, here? - Our friend Jules. - Well "Friend" is an overstatement. - The three girls who died, they... - Poison. We sent blood samples to the forensic labs upstate, they pinpointed a rare type of mold that I don't believe they ate accidentally. - Huh? - Does, that mean something to you? - If the principal ever finds out I let you in, there go my privileges. - I wouldn't have gotten you out of bed if this weren't really important. - Well there's no use in my going back home now, so is there anything I can help you with? - We need our yearbook from seventeen years ago. Look out for any blurry photos of her, too. That could easily be a spell. - Here we go. Who does this look like to you? - Whoa? - Claire, that name you gave me, is that a joke? - Why? - Well Abby Butcher is an old Brunswick name. So old that this list came up. Women found dead in Merrymeeting Park in 1689. - That can't be... the name in the middle. - Julia Sutton. Isn't that the same-- - Whoa, what picture is that? - It's a woodcut depicting the supposed rituals at Merrymeeting. - Can you cross-reference that list with students enrolled here? - Holy crap. Look who was Flower Queen seventeen years ago. Abby F'ing Butcher. - Oh my gosh. Here she is again. In 1966. Using the name Susannah Martin. - This is our oldest one, from 1932. And here's a girl named Martha Carrier, same name as one of the accused Brunswick witches. Similar features. I'm confused. What do these girls have in common? - They might be the same person. They might even be a witch who is three-hundred plus years old. One who returns to Brunswick every seventeen years and uses the names of her original victims as aliases. - This is a show you've been binging or this is real life? - Wanna see something sad? A dedication page for the other girl who went missing seventeen years ago. Sarah Gould. - What the...? - Easy. What's up? - She's not missing. - Have you been here all night? Brought you your cup of sugar with a splash of coffee. Just like you like it. Just gonna leave it right here for ya. Good talk. - Gross. What are we even doing here? - Hey, pretty ladies got a dollar? - Sorry. Fresh out. - Whores. - That bodes well. - Sarah? Can we just go? If we get back the end of first period, no even know we left. - Why don't we just skip? It might be better if everyone thinks we're missing. - Don't have to ask me twice. I love playing hooky. - Ew. What even is that? - Sarah? Sarah, hey, can we talk to you? Please. "Does she know..." Who, Jules? - Abby? No. We're alone. - It's just us. Honest. - Here, I'll take it. - Those chants didn't form a coven? They did something else? That's how she stays young? She comes back every seventeen years to replenish herself? - The magic's making us sick, is that how you lost your voice? How was your face burnt? Jeez. - How can we reverse it? Is there anything we can do? - Crown her? Wasn't planning on it. - Brooke. At the Spring Fling. They do crown the Flower Queen. If we don't stop her, she can make this permanent. - Yeah, she'll use us up and throw us away. - Sarah, no! - Claire, we can't be here when the cops come. Not if we also plan on stopping Jules. - Oh, man, I never even saw her. - Oh God. - There's nothing Strauss can do to help. - You don't know that. - We need to stop her. - MJ? It's Claire. No, don't hang up. Listen, we need you. - Do you understand? I will kill you. - I only wanted to know if your stay would be ending soon. - And that's none of your business. You two should be honored that I chose your house to stay in. - We are. We are very honored. I told you not to provoke her. - Go back to waiting in the hall. - Oh, hello. - MJ. I'm surprised to see you out. - I'll make this quick, my jaw's wired shut. Um, I came over as soon as I heard. - Thanks. They still don't know what attacked me, but they suspect-- - Wait, what? No, I meant about Claire and Brooke, they're missing. Since last night. A witness heard them fighting in the street. Police are involved. Their families are worried sick. What is happening to us? - I don't know. It's like we're cursed or something. - It's MJ. How'd it go? - You were right. She told me Brooke went rogue. Told me to go home, lock my door, and think positive thoughts. - Did she offer you anything to eat? - Yeah. A green smoothie. Disgusting. Ugh. I told her I'd drink it on the way home. Can't believe this bitch is willing to poison us. - Nice work, MJ. We'll see you tonight. Jules thinks we're out of the way. - Nice. - I decided not to take Greta to the dance and bring you instead? - Great. I'll be ready, Brett. - I don't really understand why I'm doing this. - I'm surprised you called too, but also flattered. This will be fun. - If you say so. ♪♪ - Let's set up over by the maze. Goddamn tripods. Just gimme a sec. - The unspoken goal of each senior class is to one-up the Fling's spectacle from last year. Behind me is a unique addition, of a floral maze complete with romantic grottoes and a wishing well. Can you pan around and get some B-roll, Pete? - Please Margaret, I know how to do my job. - Do you though? I don't want another fiasco like the mascot story where you forgot to run a picture of the mascot and my sister had to draw one... Jules is not our Flower Queen. Jules in not our Flower Queen. Jules is not our Flower Queen. Jules is not our-- - Oh, shit. Well that's it for me. I hope it's enough. - Say again? - She said, "It better work." And I agree. I'm getting tunnel vision. - Where the hell is she? This thing's almost over. - So Jules doesn't get crowned and just goes gently into that good night? Or does she rage against our sorry asses? - It'll show her that we're all against her, and that together we still have power. - Um... do we? - Don't all look at once, but she's here. And bitch even stole Greta's date. - Oh, that explains why he sounded half-asleep when he called to cancel. - She needed Jason, too? Greedy bitch. - It doesn't matter now. Just don't let her see you. - Hello, fellow Classmates. I hope you guys are enjoying yourselves. Happy Spring, everybody! You guys, it's the moment we've all been waiting for. It's time to crown the Flower Queen! The ballets have been counted, your vote has been heard, so without further ado, may I have the envelope please? - Excuse me. Hello. Coming through. - The 2017 Brunswick High Spring Fling Flower Queen is Tiffany Fuller! - Keep dreaming, freak. Thanks. - She's coming. - Don't let her rattle you. - We could've carpooled. - Eat shit. - Okay. What exactly is it that you think think I've done? - If you're gonna be two-faced, at least make one of them attractive. - You're stealing our powers, and you plan to keep them. - And we're here to let you know that's not gonna happen. - Claire? Jules told me that you left town. - She lied. - Chanting my crown away? That's the best you could do? - You needed that to make this permanent. - And who told you that? Crazy Sarah? Oh, I forgot. Crazy dead Sarah? There's other ways to do this, Claire. I mean, it's a bit more messy and human sacrificey but the blood will be on your hands. - Get away from him. - Let him go. - No! You witches will back off! Because, Brooke, you wouldn't want your drunken mother to fall down some stairs. And Claire, it would be a shame if say, there was an accident involving your dad and sister. And how awful would you feel, MJ, if Darren gave that engagement ring he's been carrying around to me? - Don't let her bait you. She's just-- - MJ! MJ! - Oh my God. - You stay away from-- - Jason, come on. - What the hell is going on? - Holy crap. - Go, go. - What the hell do we do now? - Why are you guys fighting Jules? She's so perfect and kind-hearted. - Because you're an idiot. And she's controlling your thoughts. C'mon. Shit. - Just give me Jason and I'll let you go. - Claire? Get him out of here. I'll keep her busy. - What do you mean? - Just let me do this, okay? Go! - C'mon, Jason. - If I had to come to this dance for 200 years I'd wanna kill someone, too. - Claire? Are you okay? - Take him. Call the cops and an ambulance. - Does this have anything to do with what we found in the yearbook? Come on. Come on! - N-No. - Come on Brooke, we're just getting started. - Brooke? Brooke, where are you? - How about a little fire, scarecrow? - Jules, stop! - Where is he? - Take me, instead. - Sorry. I need a male virgin. - Here I am. Sorry they kept me away. - It didn't have to be like this, Claire. I liked you. I might've even let you sit at my right hand. - I would've told you where to put that hand. - This has been fun. - Son of a witch. - No, forget about me. Go after them. - How? Even if I muster a spell, it'd only hurt us. - I can't hear you, so just go win. Okay? - I don't know where she's going! - It's almost midnight. Where else would Blair Bitch Project go? So what's the plan? Claire?! - Um, I don't exactly have one... planned out. - It's probably just now hitting you that we're actually flying. It's okay, I got this. Whoa. - MJ, what's happening?! - Um-- I'm not sure I got this! Oh, n-n-no! Can you make it? We're close. - I don't know. I can only see a few feet in front of my face. Oh wait, I can see with this. I can see using the viewfinder. - Okay, good. Go get her. - I don't know what to do. - Anything. Something new. - You can do this. Concentrate. Focus. - Lie down. Face up. Come closer, Claire. Get a good angle. - And what should I call you? Julia? Abby? Martha Carrier? - None of those. Mary Perkins. And if an entire mob couldn't stop me, what makes you think you can? - Whoever you are. Please don't hurt him. He hasn't done anything. - Afraid I must. See, it's either him or me. - Drop it! - Be careful, detective. - Drop the knife and back away. - Leave now, and I'll let you do so with your life. Such as it is. - I'm not going to ask again. Put your hands over your head. - Look out! Oh God. Victims, uh, victims of Jules, across time and space. Help me now, to wipe her off the face. Victims of Jules, across time and space. Help me now, to wipe her off the face. Victims of Jules, across time and space. Help us now, to wipe her off the face. Victims of Jules, across time and space. Help us now, to wipe her off the face. Victims of Jules, across time and space. Help us now, to wipe her off the face. Victims of Jules, across time and space. - It's working. - Help us now, to wipe her off the face. Victims of Jules, across time and space. - Help us now, to wipe her off the face. Victims of Jules, across time and space. Where are they going? - They're going after her, I bet. C'mon, let's... - Wha, we lost them? - Shh. Listen. This way. - Leave me to my work now, Constable. There's nothing you can-- You can't be here. You're not real! Nice try, Claire, but I've come up against smarter people than you. - I'm sure. But all at once? - Lisa? - Claire, look at Jules. - What the...? Whoa! - I'm gonna... need you to come down to the station. Make a statement. - Of course. We'll be happy to. - I mean, maybe not now. But soon. Are you two all right? - Yeah. -Yeah. - Are you? - I'm fine. I'm gonna need that tape, too. - Oh, um, it's not really tape any more. It's cards. Digital. - Okay, I'm gonna need those cards. - Detention may not seem fair, but if you repay your wrongs now, they won't catch up with you later. From Brunswick High, I'm Claire. - This is damn good reporting. - Thanks. - But, it doesn't really have an ending. I'm left with all these questions. - Life is complex. - Hey there, news geeks. Claire, you need a ride home? - Uh, yeah. Sure. - Hey, can you keep shooting on this? Maybe add something to it? I mean, we don't tell people if detention is good or bad. - That's not our job. I gotta run, Pete. - Yeah. Sure. Again, nice work. Hella good reporting. - Claire, why are you still filming? It's over. We won. Roll credits. - Hi. So I told Darren that I needed a ladies' night... so what're we doing? - Dinner at the diner? Then a movie? - Yeah. - Hey, Claire? There's a lot about last night that I don't really remember. - That's probably for the best. - As long as I wasn't caught on camera hooking up with another one of your friends or something. - No, don't worry. No one documented the loss of anyone's virginity. What? - Beerginity. Beerginity. Mine. Forget it. - All right, well, before anything else weird happens, will you let me take you out? - Sure. I'll try anything once. - Wait, are you still talking about beer? Aye si awe ten aye. Aye si awe ten aye. Aye si awe ten aye. Aye si awe ten aye.
