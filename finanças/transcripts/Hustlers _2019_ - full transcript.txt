[laughs] Yeah, she'd like to think so. I mean, some of the girls have been in, like, Playboy, Hustler. I was a centerfold once. No way. '93. - No fucking way. - Mm-hmm. Oh, my God. Back when Stevie Wonder came in. What the fuck did Stevie Wonder come to the club for? [laughing] Casey had him in the Champagne Room. Swears to God he isn't blind. Wow. How come you're so good? I see you with every single kinda guy, and... I don't know, it's like you have 'em all figured out. I guess I'm just a people person. You know? It's easier if you think of them as, like, your rich friends, you know? Some of them are not so bad. Where else you dance? I was at Sin City... - for way too long. - Mmm. Then I heard some boiler room guys saying how all the money was in the city, so... So, you followed the green brick road? - Yup. - So far so good? I mean, it's okay. Get out. I mean, you must be cleaning up. You're new. You're fucking gorgeous. You're Asian. It's like a triple threat. [laughs] But I'm not that good. I mean, if I... Maybe if you, like, I don't know, showed me moves. Maybe we could work together. You know? I could give you a crash course in this place. Introduce you to some of my regulars. It's just mostly Wall Street guys looking to spend money on pretty girls. What do you think of that? - Yeah, that would be cool. - Mm-hmm. [woman] So, it was Ramona's idea that you two work together? Yes, that's right. And at this point, everything was aboveboard. I mean, I thought she was nice. And when would you say that things got out of control? Ramona was always in control. [Ramona] Front hook. Ankle hook. Yup. Knee hook. Hold on with that knee. [Destiny] Okay. From here, you could do the carousel. Put your head back. Come down. You can do Peter Pan. Knee hook. Just spin. [Destiny] Jesus Christ. [laughs] Then you can go into a fairy sit. Oh. Stag. - [Destiny] That's pretty. - Reverse stag. That's pretty too. Scissor sit. Table top. I can't do that. You can do that. You're gonna do that. - [blows raspberry] - A climb. What if you don't have muscles to do that? - You have muscles to do this. - I don't have any. Every girl has muscles to do this. You could do this one, this is a martini. Fireman down. Boom. - That's... pretty good. - Ready? Push it, baby. You go. - There you go. Just point your toes. - Okay. There you go. Hold yourself up. I'm trying. Try laying flat across. Do a tabletop. They all love seeing that. Makes you look strong. Okay. - There you go. Yes. Okay. - Yeah? - This does hurt my vagina. - Can you grab your foot? There you go. - This doesn't look sexy. - You know what? - Thumb up your butt, almost. - Thumb up my butt? - You know how to do that. - How do I... - Put your head back. - I'm gonna fall. You're not gonna fall. Straighten your legs out. - Both of them? - Point your toes. Yes! Yeah, point your toe. [screams playfully] Oh, my God. We gotta get you outta those training pumps into a good shoe. I know. It's hard for me to balance. No. It's easier in these. Hey, you know Diamond from the Bronx, right?

[laughs] [Ramona] There, that's good. I really just go like that. - [Ramona] No, wait. Wait. - Oh, my God. What are you doing? - [Destiny] I'm trying to grind his dick. - Arch your back more. Oh, my. Move your hair, look at me or something. - Push your butt out. - No. I know I'm hopeless. No, look, that's it. You don't have to be the best dancer. You just have to make their eyes move just one inch. Come here. - What do you mean? - Let me tell you something. - [Ramona] Show her. - [Destiny] Okay. Watch and learn. - You fucking sit there. - Sit, ma. Come on. You drain the clock and not the motherfucking cock, you know what I'm saying? And you just go slow. Right there. - Slow. - And you look at them. - Super slow. - [Diamond] Uh-huh. - Slower. - A little slower. - Slower. - Sexier. - Yes. - And look back at it. Oh, yeah. They love that. The slower the better. Like a motherfucking sloth. - That's $20 right there. - Slow. Remember, drain the clock, not the cock. - Drain the clock, not the cock. - [Ramona] That's it.

Yeah. Yeah. - [Star singing operatically] - And this is Star. Hi. And you've gotta meet Liz. Liz. Liz! She playin' a song for Jackie's new titties. - They're double-Ds! - Jackie got new titties? Yeah! New titties! - It's this new gummy-bear technology. - Yes! Who did these? - Dr. Bobby. - These are good. Isn't he amazing? Thank God for Dr. Bobby. And this is Mercedes. This my baby. Hi. Nice to meet you. Hi. Nice to meet you. Destiny. Tracey. Your boyfriend's here. - What? Girl, again? - And he's crying. Crying? - Oh, fuck. - Yeah, hon. What? Girl, what's going on with Rodrigo? Girl, I don't know. He's just been so jealous lately. - "Lately"? - [Tracey] Yeah. You can't let him drop you off. You know that. I know. But, like, you know how it is. - At first, he liked this shit. - Of course he did. 'Cause you wanna know why? These motherfuckers think that it's so fun to date a stripper 'cause it's like, "We move, and we fuck. And we fuck the best. It's the shit." And then, when they realize that we work six nights a week, last shit we wanna see is their damn dicks. Okay! I just wanna chill on my couch in some feetie pajamas with my nigga, ice cream, no makeup, and for damn sure not with these on. Wait. I just make my boyfriend masturbate beside me. - [Ramona] What? - Is that weird? Shit. I haven't had sex in two years. - Oh, baby. - [Diamond] Two years? Well, I have a boyfriend. [Ramona] Since when? Since now. [all laughing] He don't bother me. He don't get jealous. The only time he complain is when I don't change the batteries, bitch. [laughing] Too bad he ain't got no money. Well, bitch, I can't have everything, can I? [laughs] [Mom] Hey, ladies, who wants cake? [all] Aww. Ma, what are you doing to us? You can't keep doing this to us. It's a little motivation for my babies. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Trying to make some extra tips. - I wanna have a tiny, tiny little sliver. - Teeny, teeny. But only 'cause I know you made it with love. Go crazy. Get a big piece. Everybody have a piece of the fucking cake. - [Tracey] Let me get my Tupperware. - I don't want that cake. [Ramona] Eat it. Hey. You an investor in this place? [Destiny] No. Then quit putting money back into it. Let the guys get fucked up. First get 'em a single, then a double, then a triple, then go back to a double, and then a single. You want 'em drunk enough to get their credit card, but sober enough to sign the check. Lenny, give us a beat. You got it, gorgeous.

The guys at the bottom, they don't do anything dirty to make money. So, most of them don't have any. But if they do, you can milk 'em for every penny. [song continues] ♪ I, I get it ♪ [Ramona] You know, maybe they're in a loveless marriage. Or maybe they're single and feeling dejected. Either way, you can string 'em along without getting physical. Chuck here pays for my apartment on the Upper East Side and I've never even sniffed his dick. [hip-hop music playing] The guys in the middle, they'll get their hands a little dirty. But they have their limits. Don't tase me, bro. They dabble in greed. But they never cross a certain line. Or maybe they're not as good at it. That's why they all share a two-bedroom in Cobble Hill. [Destiny chuckles] But then there's the motherfuckers on top. [man] You're a dickwad, fucking pussy. CEOs, CFOs, investment bankers, corporate raiders, hedge funders, ax murderers. Found footage. You like it? Take a look. Look familiar? Too close to home, mama? [Ramona] Coming straight from the crime scene into the club. But not through the front. Oh, no. These guys, they don't wanna be written about on page six. They come through the back. They take the private elevator to the one room without cameras. How you feeling today? - Oh. Feel a lot better now. - [Ramona chuckles] - [Ramona] Make some money? - Oh, yeah. And they don't leave till they spend $10,000, $15,000 in one night. They can be degrading, possessive, aggressive, violent. And they never get in any trouble. Because everyone's willing to cover their tracks. 'Cause deep down they all want what they got. They all wanna be on top... where there are no consequences. ["Mist of a Dream" by Pauline Shivers playing] ♪ I saw you ♪ You're just another deal to them.

[Ramona] What do you want for dinner, baby? I don't wanna be dependent on anybody. Like, ever. You know? I just wanna be able to take care of my grandma for the rest of her life. Maybe go shopping every once in a while. [chuckles] Yeah. That's how I feel. I just want my daughter to be able to do whatever she wants, you know? Go to whatever school she wants, or not. If that's what she wants. I swear, I'd do anything for this kid. Motherhood is a mental illness. Well, that would explain my mother. [chuckles] Hmm. [woman] Is that how you would describe her?

How much of this is going into the article? - Oh, I... - It's just, I really hope it's not some story about all strippers being thieves or whatever. - Not at all. - 'Cause they're not.

Everybody was happy. Everybody was making money. - Beautiful couch. - I know. - That's your window. - [Destiny] I got my own place in the city. That's your floor. Your living room. That's your floor.

Certainly, the largest financial disaster in decades in this country, and, perhaps, the end of an era in American business. Some of the biggest names in American business are, tonight, gone, along with a lot of money and a lot of jobs. [Destiny] The crash put everybody out of business. But I had other things on my mind. How am I gonna make money? [Brian Williams on TV] ...lost 504 points on the day's trading. I'll take care of you. Des, look at me. Look at me. I promise. I'll take care of you.

We don't need you. - [baby crying] - Remember you said this. - Get the fuck out. It's what you wanted. This is what you wanted. I don't give a shit! This is the last fucking time I'm doing this.

[clears throat] Where are you? Well, you know, I just got back to the city. Um, I moved to Arizona a few years ago. - But I've missed the seasons. - I'm just gonna take this downstairs. And I really missed you. [baby babbling] Are you still there? Yes, uh, I'm still here. Um, I'm ju... [sighs] Do you, uh... Do you need to get that? What? Do you need to help the baby? No, that's my friend's baby. I'm just watching it. Listen, I really didn't mean to bother you. I mean, if you're not happy to hear from me, - I can call somebody else. - No, no. I'm happy. I just wish that you had called sooner. Fatima came back. Who? My fiancée. I mean... [stammers] my wife. My fiancée became my wife. Right. Yeah. I know, that's how it happens. - Okay. Bye, Stephen. - If you... So, your last job was in 2008? Yes. But it's not like I was... I mean, I had a baby. So, I was busy doing that. A year of waitressing. Did you graduate high school? Oh, I see here you got your GED. Five years at Sin City Cabaret. - What did you do there, exactly? - Bartending, mostly. And what about at Moves? Bartending, mostly. So you really don't have any retail experience. No, not yet. But that's why I'd really like to get retail experience because then I would have it. We're really looking for someone with retail experience. [scoffs] Well, how am I supposed to get retail experience without retail experience? I mean, I sold beer. What's the difference? [TV playing] [baby crying] Baby, come here. Did Nana fall asleep? There we go. Are you okay? [breathes shakily] [chattering] You're in my seat. I'm so sorry. [both speaking Russian] You're so pretty. [strippers speaking Russian] [Mom] Another Red Bull? Mom! Hey! Welcome back, sweetie. - They have you up front now? - Yup. What the hell happened to this place? 2008 happened. The guys don't wanna spend money. The girls don't wanna share tips. Management has taken the cameras out of the Champagne Room. And I'm up front in customer service. Yes, I see you. Hello. Another Red Bull? Who are these girls? Russians, mostly. They look like models. They're giving blow jobs for $300 a pop. [club music thumping] Yeah? What else you got? Come on. Don't be a tease. Are you a tease? Feel how hard you make me. We're not supposed to do that. Oh, come on. Just stroke it. I'll give you $100. A hundred. One hundred. Please. Here. Three hundred. Pretty please. Just for a minute. Come on. Hey. We'll make each other feel good. [snorts] [snorts] All right. When I got off the floor, I saw that he gave me three 20s. You don't have to believe me. I'm used to people not believing me. I just wanted to tell you so that you know where my head was at when I saw her. [Ramona laughs] Whoa. [Destiny sniffs] - [laughs] Oh, my God. - There's no way. Oh, my God, she's fucking gorgeous. Of course. How old is she now? Two and a half. There's nothing like it, is there? [sighs] Juliet still lets me sleep in her bed. But I just know she's gonna throw me out any day now. I missed you, you know that? I missed you, too. Where'd you go, baby? [sighs] What happened with Johnny? Why didn't you call me? You know that you and Lily can always stay with me and Juju. You know that. No, don't do that. Come on. No. Don't do that thing. Don't do that. It's me. Hey. You remember what we were like back then? - Remember? - [both chuckle] We were like fucking hurricanes. - [Destiny chuckles] - Weren't we? [sniffs] I just need to make money right now, though, you know? I just wanna, like, be independent. Not need anybody. Just me and Lily. That's it. [Destiny] She told me what happened after the crash. With half of Wall Street unemployed, the club wasn't far behind. Mercedes got Ramona a job in fashion. I can't believe he got arrested. What am I supposed to do now? I can't afford no lawyer. I can barely afford his half of the rent. It's almost enough to make me just call off the wedding. Well? I mean, come on, Sadie. And you know I love Dragon. But do you really wanna marry someone who's probably going to prison? I don't know. Three to five is a big commitment. - Hey, Mark. - Hey, what's up? I was hoping you wouldn't mind if I ducked out early on Fridays to pick up my kid from school. She has half days for the rest of the year. Rest of the year? No. No, no. No, the rest of the school year. [mumbling] No. Well, what if I got somebody to cover my shift? - Mercedes said that she could probably... - Oh, my God. Come on. Took me forever to figure out everyone's stupid schedules. - I know, Mark. But... - I mean, really? Please. I wouldn't ask if it wasn't for my kid. Okay? She's going through this difficult time at school. She's at that difficult age. Am I the father? - What? - Am I the father? No. 'Kay. Then why should I give a shit? Right? Don't she got a babysitter or a nanny or something? I can't afford that. Well, you know, if you were putting in more hours instead of racing outta here all the time... Right? More hours, more money. More money, a babysitter. Problem solved. Craig's got two kids. You don't see him rushing home every time someone's got a nosebleed. He's here, he's doing his shifts. I can't do it.

[Ramona] Once you got 'em on the hook, that's when we get the net. Bring out the flavor. Spencer, these are my co-workers. [Mercedes] What are we cheersing today? To life. Cheers. Whoo! - Cheers. - Cheers. [Annabelle, Ramona sigh] - Ho-ho. What do we got there? - [Ramona] You want some of that? [Spencer] A little Colombian marching powder? Let me show you how it's done. - [snorts] - [Ramona] There you go. You know what we should do? We should go to a club. We should go to the strip club. I don't know. I don't know. - Come on. - It's naughty. Tomorrow we'll be at our desks at 9 a.m., regretting the moment that we could've gone to a strip club together. - Let's do it. - Let's do it. I'm in. [all laughing] [Ramona] Then we steer him to the club... - [Ramona] Need a ride, baby? - Oh, yes, I do. [all chuckling] [Annabelle] Get in. [Ramona] ...where we've negotiated ourselves a percentage of his spending. And then we run up his credit card as far as we can push it. [elevator bell dings] Easy breezy. Another round. - Yaas. - Yaas. Yeah! [Spencer] No problem. [Annabelle] There we go. - [Ramona] No problem. - [Spencer] No problem. [Annabelle] Okay, you got this. - Hey! - [Ramona] Yeah, Spencer. Tell the nice man where you live. New York! [Ramona] Little more specific, baby. Fifth Avenue. [Ramona] Close enough. [Spencer] Hey. - Bye, Spencer! - Goodbye! - Bye! - Bye! [Destiny] But like Ramona said, "Going fishing doesn't mean you catch a marlin." And some of the guys didn't want to party. Oh, no. No, thank you. [chuckles] [Ramona] Come on. You don't... - Are you sure? Come on. - I'm very sure. Thank you. You don't wanna see me after a couple of those. Oh, boy. [chuckles] [Destiny] And some of them caught on. - I can't, but this was fun. - What? Wait. Fuck. What do we do now? I'm supposed to get Dragon a new lawyer. But I can't fucking afford it now. I can't move back home. I guess it's back to the pole. [Mercedes] Sorry, Annabelle. We'll get through it. [Destiny] That's when Ramona came up with her special recipe. [Annabelle] Are you serious? It's barely any different than what we're doing now. It's just a shortcut. A sure thing. - What if someone gets hurt? - Nobody's gonna get hurt. The worst is they'll have a bad hangover. - What if somebody calls the cops? - [Ramona] And says what? "I spent $5,000 at a strip club. Send help"? No. They won't even know what happened until they check their bank account. I think I'm gonna throw up. [Ramona] Look, we're not the only ones doing this. How do you think the club stayed in business post-2008? It's a side hustle. Everybody's had to get creative, baby. [exhales deeply] I know a girl in Queens who did it. Did she get caught? No. She sent her two kids to college. And now she lives in Miami. Opened up a nail salon. Exactly. What do you think? What is it? It's ketamine and MDMA. The ketamine wipes their memory, the MDMA makes 'em happy. How many times have you done it? Three times. Including tonight. Works every time. We made five grand tonight, split three ways. Could make it four. Be like old times. Look, baby, we gotta start thinking like these Wall Street guys. You see what they did to this country? They stole from everybody. Hardworking people lost everything. And not one of these douchebags went to jail. Not one. Is that fair? You ever think about when they come into the club? That's stolen money. That's what's paying for their blow jobs. The fucking firefighters' retirement fund. Fuck these guys. Look, we can't dance forever. What are you gonna do? Go back to minimum wage? No, baby, this game is rigged. And it does not reward people who play by the rules. You either gotta stand in the corner or get in the ring. I don't wanna hurt anybody. Me either. All right? They would do this anyway. We're just helping them do it. Nobody gets hurt. Nobody gets hurt. So... are you in? Well, it's getting late. Oh, it is? What a shame. So, you gotta get up early tomorrow, or... Let's get another drink. Hmm? Hey, these are my sisters. - [Ramona] Hi, sweetie! - [Mercedes] Hi! - Hi. - Hi, baby. - Hi. - Ramona. - I'm Gary. - Gary, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - Annabelle. - Hi, Annabelle. - Isn't he so cute? Yes. - I'm Destiny. - Hi, Destiny. Can I have three shots? You know who he looks like, don't you? He looks like Tom Cruise. Right? - No, no. I'm thinking more smooth. - Tom Cruise. - [Destiny] It's the hair. - Tom Cruise? I don't know about that. [Mercedes] I know! - [Annabelle] No. - [Destiny] It's your smile. [Mercedes] It is. - It's really good. - [Mercedes] A mini Bob Saget. - Getting more Sonny. - Yeah! Sonny Bono? [Destiny] He's got the twinkle in his eye. - [Mercedes] I know! - Here we go, guys. This wine yours? - Yes, that's it. No, this is mine. - Okay, cool. - [Gary] All right, thanks. - [Ramona] Shots, ladies? - [Annabelle] Okay. Yes. - Yes. You guys are sisters? Yeah. Same dad, different moms. To sisters! To sisters. To sisters. [exhales] [Gary, Ramona laugh] [Ramona] Just put him here right now. [Mercedes] He dead? - Oh, shit. We going to jail. Damn. - [vomits] - [Destiny] Oh, my God. - Help her. - [Destiny] Oh, my God. - [Mercedes] Does this always happen? No. - [Destiny] Did we give him too much? - I don't know. - [Destiny grunts] - [Ramona] Gary. Gary. Baby. Gary, wake up. Wake up, Gary. - Gary. - [Mercedes] Oh, Gary. - [Ramona] Open your eyes. - We love you, Gary. - [Ramona] Gary! Wake up, Gary. - Fuck. Open your eyes, baby. - Wake up, Gary! Wake up! - [Ramona] Open your eyes. [breathes heavily] There you go. What was that, Gary? - Another round, Gary? - What are we gonna do? [Ramona] What do you want? Isn't this fun? - [Destiny] Uh. - [Ramona] That's it, baby. That's it, Gary. Come on. Yeah, Gary. That's it, baby. Get it. - There you go. - [Annabelle] Come on. [Ramona] This one right here? There you go. - You can do it. - Come on. Come on. [Ramona] What do you want, baby? Which one is it? That one? You need help? This one? That pretty gold one right here? - That's the one? - [Gary groans] Wow. Oh, my... [club music intensifies] - [cork pops] - [all cheering] [Mercedes] To Gary! [Ramona] Yes! The worst are the guys who go to the bathroom and put on a condom, and then you know you got to grind it out. So disgusting. We don't have to go back. Do we? - Do we have to go back? - No, baby. Your dancing days are over. - Yeah? - [Destiny] You guys, - I can pay off my grandma's house. - Yeah! - I'm getting myself a new engagement ring. - [Annabelle] That's so sweet. And Dragon's ass can stay in jail for a few more weeks. - Or a month. Or a year. - [Ramona laughing] - To Gary. - To Gary! - [Ramona] To Gary. - I love Gary. - God bless Gary. - To Gary. - [Ramona] I love you, Gary! - To Gary. - I love you, Gary. - Mom? Hi, baby. Hi, what happened? Who woke you up? Who was it? Some crazy lady woke you up? What happened? You guys are my real sisters. - I love you like you're my sisters. - Yeah. Sisters. - [Destiny] I love you. - [Mercedes] I love you. Love you. - You know I love you though. - Yes. We are a family now. Yeah. A family with money! Yeah! What are we gonna do? We're gonna go shopping tomorrow? Yes, we are! [all cheering] [laughs] Hit the Electric Slide. [Destiny] Okay. I know it sounds bad to say that we were drugging people. But you gotta understand, in our world, this was normal. I mean, half these guys are mainlining coke on their way to work. But we still wanted to make it as safe as possible. So, I suggested that we tweak the recipe. So, what do you think? Sixty MDMA, forty ketamine? That sounds good. Do we turn the liquid into a powder? Or do we turn the powder into a liquid? It's hot. - [Ramona] Eh, eh, eh. - [laughs] [sizzles] [Ramona grunts] Let's try it in the oven. [Ramona] Mm-hmm. Yes. How much? Just a sprinkle. You know, I'm still not sure about strangers. Well, that's the beauty of it, baby, they're strangers. Yeah, but I don't wanna slip it to anybody who's not already on something. We gotta know that these guys like to party. And that they've got money. Enough not to care if some of it's missing. With strangers, it's unpredictable. No guarantees. [Destiny] So, we called up some old friends. Okay. David, is that you? It's Ramona. - [Destiny giggles] Get some. - [Mercedes chuckles] Well, I can send you a picture to jog your memory. Okay, I'll send it right now. Come on. Come on, give it to me. No. Turn around. You know what they want. - [Mercedes] You're into that good time. - [Ramona] It's a sure thing. [Destiny] That's good. That's a good angle. - My baby. - Now we wait. [Mercedes] You killed it. [sighs] - [phone vibrates] - Uh... [chuckles] This was too fucking easy. - Hi, David. - [Mercedes giggles] Yeah, I can bring some of my friends. [Annabelle laughs] David, these are my sisters. ["It's Your Voodoo Working" by Charles Sheffield playing] [all] Hi. Annabelle. - David. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - [Destiny] David. - David. Nice to meet you. Mercedes.

Dragon's gonna be okay. [Destiny] Maybe one of 'em would call and complain, but we could handle it. What are you talking about? You had an amazing time. You were so happy. You kept tipping everybody, remember? Ramona could always handle it. What are you gonna do? Call the police? You really gonna tell your wife and the police what you did? You think that's worth whatever amount you're missing? No, you went out. You had an epic night. It costs money. Why should it cost you any more than that? Too cute. [Destiny] We treated it like a business. So, we'll have Annabelle meet J.P. Morgan and Mercedes meet Wells Fargo. Mercedes met Wells Fargo last time. How much did we charge last time? $5,000 on his American Express and $2,000 on his corporate card. Does he have any airline miles? - Let's check. - Worth a look. [Destiny] We invested in ourselves. - Yes. - [Annabelle] Ooh. The dolls are here! Do I look expensive? You look very expensive. And baby got back. That dress is hugging you in all the right places. [Destiny] We expanded our clientele. [Annabelle] What did you say that you did again? I am an architect. Oh. - No wonder your hands are so... nice. - Strong hands. [Destiny] But the bigger the bank account, the greater the expectations. - Let's go fuck in the bathroom. - [Annabelle chuckles] Uh, my sisters are gonna be here in a couple minutes. Let's just wait for them, okay? All right. Tick tock. [Destiny] The guys were getting more and more aggressive, and the four of us could only take on so much. So, that's when I said... We need to be outsourcing. Let's put an ad in Craigslist. So, we put an ad in Craigslist. Does anybody have any allergies? And by this, I mean really serious allergies.

[Ramona] No, they come into the club all the time. But I had a crush on this guy since I was 15. So, I was like, "Oh, my God." And suddenly, he's there. Nan, do you know who he is? You know. You must've seen him in Us Weekly. She knows who he is. Nan, you know who he is. The guy from the movies. I've seen him. He's very good-looking. [Ramona] Yeah! Well, let me tell you something: he's even more good-looking in person. I am telling you. Anyway, so he picks me up in this white Porsche. - [woman] No way. - [Destiny] Yeah. [laughs] And all he tells me is to wear a hat. - Fucking Kentucky Derby. - Yes! That's what I thought! - That's what it was, right? - That's what I thought. That's what I thought. But then, all of a sudden, we're at the airport. We're boarding this private jet - to Monaco. - [Mercedes] Oh, my God. There was champagne, lobster, a butler. And I just didn't have the heart to tell him, like, I hate flying. So, there I am in this gorgeous marble bathroom, 10,000 feet in the air, vomiting lobster and champagne. [laughing] Sit here, baby. You know, Annabelle can vomit on cue. - It's one of her many gifts. - It's not intentional. - [laughing] - [Destiny] You're so good though, baby. So, thank God, finally, this plane lands.

And where'd you go to school? Brown. For undergrad. What would you do for $1,000? Of course, the answer is gonna depend on what you already have and what you need. - So, the... - Yeah, I'm sorry. I don't think I should even talk to you anymore. It's just, I don't know you. And I'm sorry, these girls are just like my sisters, so... That's okay. I understand. Ramona said the same thing. You talked to Ramona? Yeah. When? Yesterday. Where? I went to her work. [scoffs] What? Oh, nothing. It's just... the idea of Ramona Vega trying to go straight. That's like... Well, I mean, if you talked to her, what do you need to talk to me for? I was just hoping that you could fill in some of the blanks. "Blanks"? Okay. Where was I? [chattering] [scoffs] Fucking copycats. Look, I don't think we need 'em anymore. Need who? The club. Why should we split anything when we can have it all? [Destiny] After she cut out the club, we had to meet our clients in hotel rooms. - Or in their homes upstate. - [Ramona] Where the fuck are they? Annabelle's feeling grossed-out lately. [Destiny] A lot of the girls stopped showing up. And what about Mercedes? Is she feeling "grossed-out"? We can't keep giving them their cut if they're not showing up for weeks on end. We need a bigger crew. I'm gonna call Coco. No! She's a junkie. [scoffs] Fine. What about Georgia? She just got out of jail. Trixie? She's still in jail. Ramona, quit bringing home strays.

Maybe a score so big that we would never need anybody. Is that what happened with Doug ####? Uh... I don't really remember a Doug ####. - Ramona said... - Well, Ramona's a liar. She'll say anything to make herself look better. I mean, what did she say about me? I'm sure she had a lot to say. What'd she say? She said you had a tough time growing up and that you spent a lot of time alone. You got into fights and... had some bad boyfriends. Okay. What else? That your parents were immigrants, and that when your father left, your mother dropped you off at your grandparents' house. And never came back. Is that true? I mean, I thought that she was just taking a break, you know? I thought that, you know, sometimes moms need a break. [Destiny sniffles] Why would she tell you all that? [exhales sharply] I think she just wanted me to understand that, for you, this wasn't about revenge. You were just trying to make friends. Destiny. I know I'm supposed to think that what you did was terrible and that these guys didn't deserve it. But to tell you the truth, I don't feel sorry for them. [inhales sharply] Well, I feel sorry for them. [Destiny sniffles, grunts] You know, I keep having this nightmare. Right? Where, like, I'm in the back seat of this car. This moving car. And I realize that nobody is driving the car. And I have to get to the front seat to try to stop it, and I go there, and no matter what I do, I can't get a grip on it. And I can't, like, stop it. [sniffs] And then I wake up. [chuckles] [sniffles, sighs] What happened between you and Ramona? Why aren't you talking anymore? [beeps] [sighs] [sighs] [phone vibrating] Hello? [Destiny] So Ramona met Doug years ago. Doug's friend took him to the club to blow off some steam after a few devastating events. I don't know that it is gonna be okay. How could it get worse? [Destiny] Which included his house being destroyed by a fire. - [firefighters chattering] - [sirens blaring] And separating from the mother of his young son. She never really wanted to have kids, you know? So, I think when we found out he was autistic, I think she just couldn't handle it, you know? [Destiny] He was nice. We talked about our kids. We talked about our exes. - We had a heart-to-heart. - [Ramona] Drinks! Here we go. That one's for you. - [Doug] Thank you. - You're welcome. [Elizabeth] So, what happened to Doug? [Ramona] So, what I miss? What are we doing tonight? [Destiny] Um... [Doug] Uh... The room was round. There was a table. They maxed out my corporate card... so my company launched an internal investigation, and I was fired. [Doug] Can you please just credit back my debit card? My mortgage payment's on there. What are you talking about? You were having a great time. Why are you doing this to me? Please, I have nothing. I can't... I can't afford to not pay my mortgage. [Doug sighs] My s... My son... [Doug exhales sharply] I'm really sorry. Put the phone down, Destiny. - Put it away. - Just give me a second. Don't. What the... - Gimme the phone. - Get off of me! - [Ramona] Hey! - Stop! - If we don't do it, someone else will. - Get off of me. - Gimme that fucking phone. - [Destiny grunts] [breathes heavily] Ungrateful little bitch. [pants] [grunts] [grunts] [screams] [phone ringing] [phone continues ringing] Precinct. [Doug] Yes, hello. I... I went to a strip club and I was drugged. [phone ringing] Precinct. [Doug] I was drugged, and I have proof. It was weird. It was real weird. If it hadn't been for the tape, I would've been like, "Dude, you're fucking full of shit." [Doug] Please. I just wanna know what happened to me. - [Doug sighs] - [Dawn] Um... You were fleeced, that's all. [Doug exhales] By who? [Dawn] Um... [chuckles] Well, we're, like, a little gang. You were just a target. We just gave you a little sprinkle. I'll tell you everything. I'll tell you everything I know, I promise. I know a lot. I really... I'll tell you everything. I just don't wanna go back. [Elizabeth] So, was there a sting? - [Dawn taps on microphone] - One, two. One, two. Hello, police. Can you hear me? I'm about to open the door. - Hey, did you bring the drugs? - [Ramona] Shh. - [Destiny] Where is he? - He's in the bathroom. [Dawn breathes into microphone] [Dawn] Look, like, I don't think that he likes me. So, I don't know, I think one of you is gonna have to do it. Are you high? - [Dawn] What? - Give her a break. No. Me? [chuckles] No, no. No. No. I don't do that kind of stuff anymore. That's just... it's not me. - Hey, hey, ladies. - [Destiny] Hey. - Christmas come early. - [giggling] Hey, these are my friends that I told you about. - Hi, friends. - This is Ramona. - Ramona. Hi. - Ramona. Hi. - This is... - And I'm Rhonda. - Rhonda. You are both very attractive. - Rhonda. Yeah. Thank you. Okay. Why don't you take a seat right here. We're gonna fix you a drink. - So, you stay there, okay? - You get one too. Shots? I don't know. [Dawn] We'll see about that. [breathes shakily] [Dawn chuckles] Just a second. Hmm. Hope you're thirsty. [chuckles] - Do it. - No, just go ahead. Go on. [Destiny] You found him. Go ahead. Hi. [chuckles] Here you go. Yum, yum, yummers. Slàinte. [Dawn chuckles] So, who's excited? I'm telling you, it's the same fucking car. You're being paranoid. No, I saw the same fucking Buick parked outside the Gansevoort. It's not a Buick. Well, whatever the fuck it is, it's been following us for 20 minutes. - Dawn was setting us up back there. - Dawn? Now I know you're paranoid. You really think that she wouldn't sell you out to save herself? [Elizabeth] So, there was a sting? We cannot comment on that at this time. But what we can tell you is the amount of people that were willing to talk to us was so small it was absurd. Why? I guess men don't wanna admit what happened to them, you know? Being victimized by a woman. [detective 1] So, we did some investigating, and we found the Connecticut architect who Moves said failed to pay a $135,000 bill he racked up during four visits to the club. "For a night of pleasure he can't even remember." What a boob. "And went back three more times"? [laughs] I guess he must've liked it. [all laughing] [detective 1] You know, when you look at it out of context, it seems like he's making it up. You're a family girl? You look like my brother. - Yeah? - Yeah. - You like that? - No. Why I'm here. I mean, it's not about the money. It's about the next guy this happens to, and, like, I gotta do something to stop that. [detective 1] But when you put it together with Doug, it all added up. Peter. Peter, these are my sisters. [Ramona, Destiny laughing] [chuckles] Oh, yes! [detective 1] Scary, isn't it? I mean, we got so spooked, none of us went back to the club anymore.

[detective 1] Which one of you is the ringleader? This is unbelievable. You guys are really something, you know that? Does Tony know about this? Take a seat, Miss Vega. This is crazy. We didn't do anything wrong. You know, Tony wouldn't let this happen. I'm gonna text him. [detective 2] Who gave her her phone back? Think about your daughter. You're facing felony charges here.

[detective 2] Think about your daughter. Mercedes is probably gonna use Dragon's lawyer. So, you, me and Annabelle should probably lawyer up. Do we know any lawyers from the club? That guy, Jeremy? Or maybe Anton? I took the deal. You did? Have I taught you fucking nothing? You fucking idiot! What the fuck is wrong with you? Why would you do that? For Lily. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. [inhales sharply] Motherhood is a mental illness. [both crying] [Destiny] I'm sorry. - [Ramona inhales deeply] - [Destiny cries] We were fucking hurricanes, weren't we? [chuckles] Yeah. [crying continues] [gasps] [phone ringing] - [Elizabeth] Hello? - Hi. Um... Hi, Elizabeth. It's Destiny. Hey, Destiny. How are you? I'm good. I'm really good. Lily's great. Um... Oh, I put the house up for sale. We're moving back to Queens. You know, I've been making a ton of new friends. And, oh, I met this guy who... He's gonna help me get a job in pharmaceuticals. So I'm really excited about that. - Are you still there? - I'm here. So, I was just reading the article again, and maybe the reason why we did what we did is because hurt people hurt people, you know? Yeah. No, I understand. So, have you talked to Ramona lately? No, just that one time. - Have you? - No. Um... Can I just ask you... Like, what else did she say about me? So, I used to live in the Bronx back then. But I was seeing this guy who had a walk-up right next to where I stripped. So, I was staying at his place, like, every night. But one morning, I go back to my place, and the door's wide open. And I was freaked out, you know? I was like, "Oh, my God. All my stuff. All my valuable stuff is in this place that I'm not even sleeping in." So, now I just carry everything with me everywhere I go. Let me show you. Let's see. This. This is a patch from my grandpa's uniform. He was in the navy. Oh! This is my... my grandma's wedding ring. Isn't that pretty? And this one was my mother's. It's the three birthstones of me and my sisters. The ruby's me. I was a July baby. I have two sisters. One lives in Arizona, the other one lives in Texas. We try to get together once a year, but with the kids, it's impossible. Do you have kids? Not yet. Well, don't worry. You're young. And you have amazing skin. [chuckles] Is that you? That's me. [chuckles] I was 15. A senior had asked me to the prom. I look terrified. I like the dress, though. And this here, this is Dorothy. Wasn't she the cutest? Who could leave that baby? You know, we used to say, "If only we had known each other back then." You know? Maybe we could've... looked out for one another. Maybe our lives would've been different. You know? Or maybe it would've just been the same. Who knows? But I like to keep her with me. What else you wanna know? [sniffles] [no audible dialogue] [Elizabeth] You should give her a call, Destiny. [sniffles] Yeah. [camera shutter clicking] [camera shutter clicking] [Ramona] Look, there's nothing I can really say to make sense of what went down. But everybody's hustling. This city... Fuck, this whole country is a strip club. You got people tossing the money... and people doing the dance. [club music playing] [Lenny] One last time, everybody, let's hear it for our girls! - [Mercedes] Hit it! - [Ramona] Okay? [chattering] [all] Whoo! [Mercedes] Oh! Whoo! [Mercedes] One, two, three, four! Go. Go. Go. [club music continues] [Lenny] That's it, folks. It was fun while it lasted. See me on your way out, I'll be selling excuses for why there's glitter on your pants. We got a lot of ladies in the house tonight. Must be a bachelorette party going on. There is no flash photography here at Moves. In fact no flashing of any kind. It's time to go home gentleman. The girls are not coming back out. On behalf of Moves, make sure you tip your waitresses, and get home safe. Good night everybody. I'm sure I will see you again. Real soon. [music ends]
