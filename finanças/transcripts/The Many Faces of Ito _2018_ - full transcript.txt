We can use random accidents or coincidental events to generate certain effects. The issue is how to present these events in the most natural way possible. What do you think about the scene where the characters run into one another? It doesn't work. Does that really happen? Do you randomly run into someone you love on the street? That never happens. That is just too convenient. I would turn that drama off. Tokyo is too big and is filled with too many people for such random meetings. But that has happened to me. I randomly ran into the girl I like the other day. There he goes. You are so special. Such dramatic events don't happen to people like us. You lack romance. Can you write a drama like that? We used to fight a lot. But I felt like we understood one another on a deeper level. Isn't that why something so rare like that happened to us? Maybe I am just lucky. I believe that we all have someone who we are destined to be with. Right, Ms. Yazaki? Okay. To sum up, it is possible to run into your beloved on the street. But that only happens to hot guys. That's not fair. Ms. Yazaki. DRAMA WORKSHOP BY RIO YAZAKI BOOK SIGNING & AUTHOR TALK WITH SCRIPTWRITER RIO YAZAKI Hello. I am Rio Yazaki. These are ordinary women. I'm sorry. I'm just so overwhelmed. Love is the most difficult subject in the world. No matter how much knowledge, sense, and experience you have, the mysteries of love are still difficult to decipher. But don't worry. Everyone has potential to love. If I smile, they smile. If I speak, they thoughtlessly nod. They're such boring women. Sometimes, it is important to compromise. No one can guarantee you that love will come to you. RIO YAZAKI Good work, Ms. Yazaki. How did it go? It was a bore. This is an important part of your work. Well? Is any of this usable? It is pointless to lecture women who have no sense of self-actualization. Don't they have anything better to do than come here? But you did find them, didn't you? Women who interest you. A: Tomomi Shimahara, Age 28 They have dated for five years. But she still has not had sex with her boyfriend. Five years? B: Syuko Nose, Age 24 She doesn't want to be treated as a woman. And yet, she is being stalked. This woman wants to give her virginity to her former classmate. What year do they think it is? They are all pathetic. This could be material for your project that everyone is waiting for. It could work. The clumsy love stories of real women. Are you serious? I am in a difficult position. The next project looks like it will be canceled. Kuzuken's project? Yes. It looks dire. There will be trouble if Kuzuken's project is canceled. As its producer, I will face the consequences too. Let's do this. Let's make a drama that can surpass Tokyo Doll House. Let's work together again. A: Tomomi Shimahara, Age 28 B: Syuko Nose, Age 24 C: Satoko Aida, Age 23 D: Miki Zinbo, Age 23 BOOKSTORE "Be in Love like Heroines'." BE IN LOVE LIKE HEROINES' BY RIO YAZAKI Rio Yazaki. Do you know her? I know the name. I went to her event. -I'm leaving. -Wait for me. RAMEN Quit that. It is exhausting when you try to serve me. Okay. That reminds me. -I brought the gummy candy you asked for. -What? I figured this was the best gummy candy out there. This is great. You have great taste. I'll pay you back later. -Is that a gift for someone? -Yes. -Who? -A coworker. Sorry for the wait. -Welcome. -Table for two. Come in. Okay. I fell in love with this girl. -What? -I haven't been in love in a while. Wish me luck. I see. That's wonderful. What? I'm relieved. You can actually fall in love. What are you saying? Of course, I can. She is very sensitive. She is different from other girls. Maybe that's because she went to art school. She reads a lot and we have the same taste in movies. She seems like she would support my dream of becoming a scriptwriter. She knows a lot about movies. She sounds lovely. Yes. She understands me better than anyone. I can't take this anymore. We have been like this for five years. A: TOMOMI SHIMAHARA (28) That must be tough. A: Tomomi Shimahara (28) Has not had sex with the man she loves. When we met at a group meeting, I felt as if he was riding on an escalator all alone. Everyone else got off and headed toward their workplaces. But he was still climbing higher and higher. Loving him gives me anxiety from time to time, but that's better than ignoring him. Listen. Do you want to stay somewhere tonight? It is late. What's wrong? We don't get to meet often. I want to spend more time together. I need to get my bicycle. I'll come with you. Okay? I want to stay faithful to the girl I love. Sorry. I just can't. I'll call you. Hey. Wait for me. I want to stay faithful. I want to be together. Please. Enough. Wait! Please! Is there something wrong with me? Do you want to have sex with him? Or do you want to have a relationship with him? What do you want? I don't know. I don't even know what I want anymore. It might be best to clean the slate. Clean the slate? To desire something while not knowing what that something is, is pointless. But... I can't give up now. Why not try cutting contact until you find the answer to that question? I don't think you should sell yourself short. Good morning. Where is Syuko? Who knows? Good morning, Seijiro. Good morning. DROP OF VENUS Total Emotions. It will turn your life around completely. It will change your life. Thank you. TOTAL EMOTIONS TURN YOUR LIFE AROUND This isn't going to change anything. Ms. Nose. Are you late again? Sir. I'm sorry. These are yesterday's quiz papers. They are filled with grading errors. I'm sorry. I am tired of hearing you apologize. You always seem to be somewhere else. I'm sorry. You need to take this more seriously. Sorry. But check it again. This is just a part-time job. What? Did you say something? I didn't say anything. Your prince put it there. These are your favorite gummies. Let's walk home together. What? Yikes. You'll need to leave early. I'll punch out your time card. Thank you. He is so creepy. Yes. But you should be careful. What? Your prince is our boss' nephew. His family owns lots of land in Chiba. I'll have to be a bit more careful. That's why he can afford these expensive candies. Tomomi: It is late. Do you want to stay somewhere tonight? Man: I want to stay faithful to the girl I love. NEW MESSAGE FROM TAMURA How long will it take? I want to submit it soon. Please hurry. Scriptwriter Kuzuken. Should you be here? Don't call me that, Scriptwriter Rio. Mr. Tamura will yell at you again if you waste time. I need to see my adored teacher's face in order to motivate myself. Well said. Have you... been working on something with Mr. Tamura recently? What? You came to the office before. Right. It is still in the planning stage, though. A new project? My project isn't going well at all. Wait. You aren't looking to take my project's slot, are you? Of course not. By the way, at the drama workshop the other day, Ito went on and on about love and fate. Ito has never had a healthy, loving relationship. He started a blog in his own name. He criticized different dramas as if he was a TV critic. The angle of his criticisms was so lame. Let's quit talking about him. Fine. Ito: Did you leave already? I wanted to go with you. Did something happen? Why aren't you replying? I waited so that we can go together. Please reply! Look at all these clothes. Sorry. They are for the location shoot tomorrow. Even stylists have a hard time. Being a curator is not easy. That's true. Syuko. What is with that shirt? Who cares? My part-time job doesn't pay enough for me to buy stylish clothes. There are a lot of cheap stores that sell cute clothes. Look. Look at this. It costs less than 5000 yen. I don't know if someone in their mid-20s should be wearing dresses worth 5000 yen. You were the one who said you were broke. I am, but they say you spend more when you buy cheap. It is a waste in the long run. I would rather buy something expensive that I can use for a long time. Do you think you'll stay at your new job? It doesn't matter. This is just a transition phase until I return to being a curator. Syuko, you aren't committing because you think this is a transition phase? Things will be easier once you overcome difficulties. Aren't you going to answer? It's an unknown number. It might be the art museum. It's the results of that interview. No. It might be him. Him? Listen to me. -Answer the phone. -Fine. Hello? From before? Yes. Not this time? Yes. Yes. Thank you. Whatever! Let's drink tonight! Fine. Let go of me. Quit it. Did you drink that beer? -I sure did. -Already? Syuko. Wait. Why did you leave early today? Did you see my letter? I don't understand. I asked for your address and waited outside. You ignored my messages. Did I do something to offend you? Was it that old man... I mean... Did the manager tell you about that? About what? I sometimes... meet with a woman. I see. You left because of that. That makes sense. I am really sorry. What? What are you talking about? I am not -dating her or anything. -What? She is beautiful and a good person. But... I can't breathe when I am with her. She idolizes me for some reason. It is so exhausting. If you don't like her, then don't meet with her. Okay. If I promise you that I won't see her anymore, would you be willing to date me? No. I don't like your constant texts and you showing up like this. What? So what is that? You must think that you are a pretty big deal. -What? -If you don't like me, then why did you eat the candies I gave you? I haven't even told you that I like you yet. Do you know what happens to people who treat me that way? What? Where are you going? Why? B: Syuko Nose (24) Full of excuses, but no action. It is a pain. I'm thinking of quitting my job. I don't think you should quit because of that jerk. Whatever. It's just a transition to the next job. I never planned to work there long. How can I put it? This is just a transition phase. Transition phase? I am not living my real life now. How amazing is your real life? What? There is no such thing as a transition phase. Every moment of your life is real. Don't you need to treasure the present? You won't try something if you think it's impossible. You are always like this. You never set any bold goals or buy something expensive and try to become someone who fits it. You would never do anything that lame. What do you mean by that? Nothing. Listen. Are you really looking to work as a curator? It just seems like you are being too picky. That was cruel, Maki. You think I am just floating around. I have never properly loved anyone. I bounce around from job to job. What is so special about working? You have so many opportunities to change, but you choose not to take them. Sorry. Work has been awful. Sorry to take that out on you. Don't you need to treasure the present? The men involved with A and B are really awful. The women are terrible, too. Everyone is awful. There it is. One of your famous lines. Let's continue to dig into this. Should I continue the interviews? What do you mean? Will this actually become a drama series? The station has cut ties with Kuzuken and is actively looking for a new project. I trust you. The clumsy and bittersweet love of real women. Isn't that where you shine? Rio. What? I am getting married. What? I am getting married. I see. We'll have to stop doing this then. Rio. What? Nothing. OUTSTANDING ORIGINAL SCRIPT I would prefer tea if possible. I only drink decaffeinated coffee. You have specific taste, don't you? Do you think that romance is necessary for creators like us? Why didn't you submit your proposal? A lot happened. I had been working on this project for a long time, but the story was exactly the same as the film that won the Academy Award. That was really depressing. I see. That is too bad. I want to stand somewhere where I am alone. In that case, you might need romance. It is easier to recreate complex human emotions when you are in love. I knew it! Yes. I started a blog. I want to show it to you. A blog? About what? I am harshly criticizing current TV dramas. I think a lot of people agree with me. Really? I'll check it out sometime. To be honest, I might be better suited to work as a critic. Analyzing a drama with a critical eye could be very helpful. That's what I thought. -Good morning. -Good morning. Where is Syuko? She quit. Seriously? Isn't is because someone was being too aggressive? What is she doing now? Who knows? What does that mean? You're her friend, aren't you? What? Ms. Nose quit. Do you have a problem with that? No. I'm fine. Please check out Total Emotions. Sorry! I'm so sorry. Here. You are a kind person. Let me just check our inventory. Thank you. Come on. Don't give me that look. This is my only way to move forward. The girl I was in love with quit her job. I see. Listen. I am going to be reborn. Who is the one who actually understands me? I finally have the answer. I was so blind. I'm sorry. I am so dumb. You were by my side the whole time. I've realized that I need a fresh start. So... I decided to attend this seminar. A seminar? It is to make myself better. How can I say it? It is a workshop that changes your mental attitude. But it costs a lot to attend this. It is called "Total Emotions." It costs 200,000 yen to join. It costs 200,000 yen? Where can I get that much money? Just kidding. That was just a bad joke. Sorry to bother you during work. I need to do something about my personality. Should I lend him the money? But... what should I do? Do you love him? Or hate him? It seems like you don't know anymore. Think about it this way. In order to escape from his spell, is 200,000 yen too expensive? Or is it a cheap price? I didn't like myself. I knew I needed to change. That is why I applied to Total Emotions. I was so surprised. -I listened to the lessons... -Thank you. Here. Please take the brochure. Thank you. I was so shocked that, in just one week, my life changed so much! I will now start the orientation. Please come this way. Why don't you try to change, too? Syuko? Why are you here? What a coincidence. Are you going to this seminar? I was just passing by here. Mr. Ito! Yes? How will you be making your payment? I will be paying in installments. I don't have the 200,000 yen on hand now. -Okay. -Two hundred thousand yen? I don't plan to work in that cram school for long, either. This is just a transition phase. It is just a bridge on becoming a scriptwriter. Transition phase? Right. Transition phase. In order to emerge from this transition phase, I decided to attend this seminar. You understand, don't you? I felt a shiver down my spine. "I am not like you. Don't compare us." That's what I thought. But you two were the same. Yes. I might have joined the seminar if I didn't run into him. So? We are filled with excuses. We blame the people around us for our failures. We delay all important decisions. So stupid. I am leaving. What? -What's wrong? -This seminar won't change anything. I'll just be forced to listen to rich people brag about their success. Isn't screenwriting usually done alone? You're right. You are so smart. I might have met you here because of fate. I feel so inspired talking to you. Skilled people wouldn't come here. I had a moment of weakness. I wasn't able to trust my skills. I can't stay like this. I want to become my true self. I don't want to be here anymore. Shouldn't you treasure the present? I know that now. Every moment of my life is real. TOTAL EMOTIONS Quit that. You are in the way! I wanted us to use this bathtub together. No! This is my office. If there was a bathtub, it would become a bathroom. But you don't need to tape it shut, do you? I will write here. I will create story after story. This is my battlefield. So this cannot be my home. Is this proof of your determination as a scriptwriter? Exactly. Hold this. This shows my determination. Enjoy. It's about the money for that seminar you talked about. Oh, that? I don't need that anymore. What? I am thinking about shelving the scriptwriter dream for a bit. What is this? It's 200,000 yen. Seriously? You took me seriously? I never asked you to lend me this. This is the part of you that I don't like. You do things without even asking me. I feel suffocated around you. Use this. What? Did you hear me? The girl I loved showed me the truth. I understand now. You can use 200,000 yen, can't you? You don't need to return it. I don't need it. Why? There must be something you want. You can buy something or take a trip. You can use it as down payment for an apartment. No. I can't use it. Why? Anyone can find a way to use 200,000 yen. Why? I don't know. I don't know my own value yet. I don't want to take that much from you. Fine. I'll spend it then. I'll spend it on myself. Take care. I must have wanted to think the five years I spent in love with him were not a waste. Since I worked so hard, I wanted that effort to pay off. I was so desperate to make him say that he loved me. But in the end, I backed him into a corner. I think you have that part wrong. You backed yourself into a corner. At least now, you finally have your answer. Well? These women freed themselves from their terrible men. I like these plots. They're interesting. Really? Both A and B talk about the same seminar. TOTAL EMOTIONS "Total Emotions." Could it be the same man? No way. Is that just a coincidence? Of course. Put that aside. I can write this drama. Right? That depends on the next plot. I am looking forward to it. I'm calling the next two women C and D. They are actually best friends. This story will examine the strength of female friendships. Doesn't that sound interesting? Excuse me. Yes? What? Right. Miki Zinbo, Satoko Aida These are the best tarts. But I need to lose weight. Why? Don't worry about that. You haven't gained any weight. That isn't true. My belly is sticking out. How many times do I need to tell you? You are cute just the way you are. Right? Hello. Newbie. Why didn't the office send the schedule for tomorrow? Should I have them send it now? You're late. I already did that. Roger that. Understood. We're moving locations. Roger that. Zinbo. Do you want to meet up? Hey. I'll bring a tart again for your birthday. Let's celebrate together. About that... Is that from Ito? Yes. He wants to meet. He is asking you out on a date. No. Did I tell you that I set him up for a new job? I think so. He probably just wants to complain about it. I see. Your unrequited love is finally going to be requited. That's not it. You have it wrong. Well? Show me. I'm the love master. What should I write back? C: Satoko Aida (23) Uneasy about her friend's romance. C: SATOKO AIDA (23) She is getting carried away. I know she can't help it. She isn't used to dating. But she has even started dieting. She never did anything like that before. Are you worried that she will be taken from you? No. Nothing like that. But you must be concerned. What? What if the man is just playing with her? Right. That's exactly right! I have met him twice before, but I don't know what is so great about him. Well, he is certainly handsome. He is her first boyfriend, right? She probably isn't able to see him for who he really is. I am worried. Miki might get hurt. You need to see if he can protect her. You are her best friend, after all. That's right. C: Satoko Aida (23) Uneasy about her friend's romance. Ms. Yazaki. Aren't you going a little too far? The idea of her protecting her friend is an excuse. She is jealous. Jealous. Jealousy... She might steal her friend's man. Will she make a move? This woman will not allow her friend to be happier than her. I see your engines are revved up. If we keep this up, this drama will surpass Tokyo Doll House. Then we need these women to get dirtier in order to achieve that feat. Later. Goodbye. Who was that? Rio Yazaki. The writer of Tokyo Doll House. Right. That old drama. By the way, have you found a replacement for Kuzuken's project? Don't worry. I am making progress. I am putting my faith in you. Bring me a fresh scriptwriter. Hello there. Sorry for the wait. A fresh scriptwriter? If I knew one, I would have already brought them to you. -Welcome. -Welcome. Ito? Satoko? Long time no see, Ito. It has been a while. I reserved a cake for today. Zinbo's birthday is next week, right? She likes the cherry cakes from here, right? I am so happy for her. Please fill this out. Okay. Please. Miki is so beautiful and smart. I am proud to be her friend. I was so happy when I heard that she was going to have a boyfriend for the first time. First time? She was a bit worried since you are her first. But she boasted about how you understood her completely. That isn't true. I am not that understanding. I worry about a lot of things. Is that so? That's all you need to fill out. If you two have any issues, please feel free to talk to me. For my best friend, Miki, I will listen to anything you have to say. Really? Really. D: Miki Zinbo (23) Wants to give her virginity to her beloved. We are going to be alone for the first time. D: MIKI ZINBO (23) You have liked him for such a lot time. He has this ability to touch people emotionally. When I was in university, I was so busy with work, class, and club. I didn't even have time to sleep. FILM CLUB SCREENING GONE WITH THE WIND Are you tired from work? You can sleep. Don't overwork yourself. You should live at your own pace. Is this outfit weird? No. It is really cute. I hope everything goes well. I had a conflict with Chief AD over our methods. Perhaps it's because of the way we think. Our differences lead to us arguing. That sounds tough. Well, we do need to cool down, for the sake of each other. So I am not going to tomorrow's location shoot. Is that okay? It's fine. Let's meet tomorrow, too. We can have another date. Is that okay? I am free. I don't have any plans. I see. So, let's stay together tonight. Okay. Zinbo? Zinbo? Please. What's wrong? Nothing. It's just... Well... This is all so sudden. He was amazing. He was so kind. But his kisses were intense. I see. His touches were amazing, too. I could tell that he is a real man. Does he hate me now? We didn't do anything that night. It feels like he is avoiding me lately. He won't even see me when I go to his workplace. He might think that my virginity is a heavy burden. It might be best to unburden yourself with things like this. If I lose my virginity, would he meet with me again? Yes. He actually asked me out. Her man. When I heard about this place from Miki, I wanted to come. I see. Great. Do you know about jazz? Not at all. Please teach me. I see. Zinbo did a lot of research. But it was all from the Internet. She was more excited than I expected. Right. Don't tell her I said that, okay? Of course, I won't tell her. If I did, she would find out about this. She would know that we met. Good evening. This is our menu. What am I doing? What am I doing with Zinbo's best friend? That's right. You have a loving girlfriend. You shouldn't do this. She isn't my girlfriend yet. Is that so? Do you do things like this with Miki? I... I... I don't. Not with Zinbo. Not with anyone else. I've never done it. I've never done it to the end. I'm a... You really are amazing. You and Zinbo are completely different. Zinbo is a baby compared to you. You know exactly what to do to make me feel good. You must be very experienced. Amazing. Women like you actually exist. There was one time when Zinbo and I almost did it. But she just... took off her own clothes and said "Please." She had so much hope in her eyes. What was I supposed to do then? How was I supposed to react when she suddenly threw herself at me? I don't like women who are too aggressive and forward. She started insisting that it wasn't her first time. She got so defensive. But, I did not lay a finger on her. So then, she started crying. I really can't handle such troublesome women. I'll go take a shower. I am an idiot. I am such an idiot. Ms. Yazaki. Why are Miki and I this different? Compared to Miki, I am nothing. Do you need to compare yourself to others? Hello. I see you are working on your new project. Nothing like that. I am doing love advice sessions for that event I did. But all of these women are boring. What's the problem? That's right. You went to Sophia University, too. Do you know her? Miki Zinbo Wait. Kuzuken knows Miki Zinbo? They went to the same university. There was something suspicious about his reaction when he saw her picture. Is she going to lose her virginity to Kuzuken? You are a lucky one, Ms. Yazaki. This is such a mess. I am so excited to write this! This will make a great television series. I told you that from the start, right? I wonder who the cast will be. Look at you, already thinking that far ahead. I need to go. Bye. What's wrong? I finally understand the meaning of what you said before. What did I say? The question of whether love is required to create art. Right. That. I am thinking about writing a series. -What? -I found a story I want to write about. It is about these women who appeared in my life. It is about how each woman sees this man. Doesn't that sound fresh and interesting? It will be a drama about women involved with the same man. That does sound innovative. I know, right? I knew that you would understand my vision. Once I finish the script, I am thinking of entering it in a contest. I can't recommend that. What? Didn't you get your big break by winning a contest? If you are writing a series, it is a waste to enter it in a contest. Really? Those contests are like the lottery. You shouldn't rush your writing debut. You should watch different films and read different books. It is best to build up a knowledge base. If you don't, you'll lose the ability to create more once you go pro. I don't think you should rush things. After all, you finally found this wonderful story. I understand. I won't rush this. Good. But when I finish my script, you'll be the first person to see it. I look forward to that. I want to lose my virginity. I will become a new person. I've cleared him from my mind. You are lying about that, aren't you? It's the truth. I want to move forward for my own sake. Listen. I'll ask you one more time. Do you really want to do this with me? Yes. I have made my decision. Okay. I'll trust your decision. Thank you. Yes? Hello? It's me. What is it? What do you mean, "What is it?" I want to meet again. I ended things with Zinbo. It seems that I really like you. Yes. What? What are you saying? Miki said that your kisses and touches were amazing. So I was curious how the sex was. But you were a 28-year-old virgin. Gross. You've never felt love before. All you do is run away, no matter how pathetic it is. You have never fully loved someone like Miki, have you? You are really disgusting! Idiot! Hello? Zinbo? Ito said that he is coming here. What? Why is he coming now? I don't understand. Are you that happy? Look at you, getting ready for him. We'll be in trouble if he comes here. He isn't coming. You want him to come, don't you? Lipstick. Don't you? Why him? He made you cry. It is my fault that things didn't go well between us. I was too burdensome. So I don't blame him for breaking up with me. You completely changed when you found out that he was coming. That's not true. Listen. Why did you come here tonight? Right? You wanted to change, right? You wanted to lose your virginity, right? Why not me? What? I always... Don't open it. Hello? Mr. Tamura? I am writing this amazing scene right now. Kuzuken and Miki knew each other after all. And she chose to lose her virginity with Kuzuken. All of the men A, B, C, and D met were the same man. What? I found out who he is. Wait. How did you know? Seijiro Ito. He is a student in your drama workshop. Ito handed me a script in the hall. The women in his script have the exact same experiences as the ones you are writing about. No way. I don't know him, but he is your student, right? Wait. Why him? There is also one more woman in Ito's story. What? The fifth woman. Woman E. E: Rio Yazaki ITO'S A TO E MAIN CHARACTERS Were you lying when you told me you loved me? What? You were the one who dumped me. I never said that I wanted to break up. I just asked you to wait for me to be ready. I liked that pure and serious part of you. I liked that you didn't fool around with men like other women. Were you just playing with me? You are the one playing with her. Don't toy around with other people just because you lack self-confidence. Lack self-confidence? Me? If you are still a virgin at your age, you know the pain of being teased. What? I am not a virgin. You lack experience and imagination. That is why you can easily hurt others. Listen. Enough of this. Go home. We are going to enjoy the rest of the night. I am not a virgin! In fact, I slept with your friend, Satoko Aida. -What? -I asked her out! -Why? -Listen. If by some chance you are telling the truth, why would you say that here? That is too cruel. You're lying, right? It's the truth. That's why it was too painful to be with you. I came to say goodbye. I am an awful person. I deeply hurt both you and Satoko. I drove you both to madness. This guy is swimming in narcissism. We didn't break up. -Zinbo? -Ito, you have it wrong. I am not dating Kuzumi. You said that my virginity was too burdensome. I just wanted to lose it. That's all. Anyone would do. I don't believe you. After all, Kuzumi loves you. Everyone in our seminar knew that. Kuzuken? What? I had no idea. You seem like the type that would sleep with just anyone. -Enough. -What? This is all too ridiculous. You two should figure this out. I wish you two happiness together! You... You are too cruel. Sorry. Satoko must have been laughing at me. I asked her to introduce me to someone, it didn't matter who. Do you know what she said? "You shouldn't sell yourself short." A friend would naturally say that. But she sleeps with anyone. Isn't it odd to say that? When you sleep with someone you don't care about, there is an emptiness the next morning. Do you understand that? Emptiness? She has experienced many empty mornings. Wasn't she just trying to protect you from that pain? It appears that Ito is setting these women free. Well? What are you going to do with Ito's script? Haven't all of these women grown through this experience? Don't change the subject. I am submitting Ito's proposal at the planning meeting. Why? Ito's script felt more real and interesting. The story is about him. I suppose that makes sense. I've done this much work and you tell me this now? You were the one who told me to write about the messy love of real women! You are simply looking at these stories from the side. Your script doesn't capture the messiness of life. Your script also lacks the sadness that Tokyo Doll House had. Are my days as a scriptwriter over? You treat people's desperation like it's nothing. But I believe that people's true selves exist in that embarrassing mess. Why are you being so serious? I am always serious. Even if I write a story like Tokyo Doll House, modern viewers won't appreciate it. Most modern dramas are just based on previous works. There are too many restraints. It is suffocating! It's impossible to write something great nowadays. What? More excuses? But, if by chance your proposal is accepted, Ito can't write it. He hasn't written anything. He is just a novice. Everyone is a novice at first. It is my job to transform him into a professional. Transform him? You don't have time for that. I'll write it. This pressure often produces something amazing. Kuzuken was the same. So were you. -But... -I am going. Please! Let me write it! Are you really that desperate? You are Rio Yazaki and he is your student. Please! Give me two days. I'll write something amazing! You must have something better to do. Please! Miki Zinbo, Age 23 You tried to steal Ito's project, didn't you? The rumors are spreading. Your workshop students know, too. That is why they stopped attending class. I wouldn't try stealing from him. They finally realized it. There is no point in going there. Even if they think up a great project, you'll just snatch it. Kuzuken, are you bored? Aren't you embarrassed to act like this? If Ito's proposal is accepted, I'll support him. But do you think he can actually produce good work? In order to protect Mr. Tamura's pride, I submitted my proposal as insurance. Can't you see how thoughtful I am? Don't be so foolish. I thought... that you and I were companions. We strip ourselves down and writhe in pain to write our scripts. I thought we were the same! We don't fear revealing ourselves. We continue to write without fear of outside opinions. I understand why you don't like people like Ito who are all talk. What are you talking about? But you... You're trying to bring him down and destroy his future completely. All because you cannot write anymore. Don't take it out on me. What? Ito took a woman from you, right? You like her. Miki, right? A man like Ito took a woman you like. That must eat at you, right? Didn't the same thing happen to you? Didn't Mr. Tamura toss you aside? Since then, you've been in this slump. You haven't written anything in years. I wish Mr. Tamura would at least give you closure. Shut up! Don't talk about him. He never planned to let me write it. But he just wanted to watch me get my hopes up. Kuzuken. You should be careful, too. He talks a lot, but there is no way to know what he is really thinking. I heard it. I heard him negotiating with the lead producer. This plot isn't interesting from the woman's perspective. But this story is about real women. We need to see the story from the man's perspective. -The man's perspective? -Right. I'll tell Ms. Yazaki right now. Could you wait until she is finished with her rewrite? Please. He asked for more time for you to write. I loved that series. Tokyo Doll House. After withdrawing money from an ATM, Syuko goes to the bag shop. Welcome. This bag has the highest quality. It is lighter than it looks, too. It gains more texture the more you use it. Please try it on. I know that I can't stay that way anymore. I thought that I wanted to become a woman who suits this bag. I was a child. I hurt Kuzuken. I was jealous of my best friend. I hated being so heavy. I only thought about how to remove that weight. I experienced an empty morning. Now, I can meet Satoko. No. I want to meet her. Hello. Please give me a tart. Two tarts. To: Producer Tamura Sending you the 6th draft YOUR MAIL WAS SENT -Looking good. -Yes. Hello? To cut to the chase, neither Ito's nor your proposal was accepted. I see. Yes. The film director Mr. Yamada's proposal was accepted. He used the pop idol Misaki in his last film. She will be the lead. Ms. Yazaki? When you thought my proposal was going to be accepted, you panicked, didn't you? I don't intend to write a series. I won't be submitting to any contests either. Let alone write a full drama series. Why did you give him your script then? I wouldn't call it a script. It was only a few pages. The story stops in the middle. What? I don't understand. Why did you do that? I don't really have a reason. If I had to guess, I suppose I just wanted to see the other workshop students panic. But the one who panicked the most was... Ms. Yazaki. It was you. Don't be stupid. That's why you float around without any friends. You're still a virgin, aren't you? I am no longer a virgin. So what? They all hate you. They think you are annoying. They are laughing at you. I, myself, am laughing at all of you. I don't have the sort of complexes that you and Kuzumi have. I don't have that meaningless thirst for battle. From my perspective, you are all fixated on pointless things. "How do people see me?" "Am I the best?" "Does the world recognize my work?" Unfortunately, I never had any plans to complete that script. I don't want to participate in your exhausting race. All you do is make excuses to avoid joining this race. I accepted that without a doubt. Did you not notice that? You feel like you've won, don't you? In this world, there is something much more important than winning. What do you think that is? It is to avoid being hurt by anyone. Whether in television, films, or novels, they say to not be afraid of getting hurt. But that rule ignores the weak. There are only a handful of people in this world that can survive after being hurt or stand up after being embarrassed. No one realizes that. You should not be with someone who makes you miserable. You must be with someone who makes you feel comfortable. Would you like this one? I am never the one to fall in love first. Please. Don't hate me. Anyone who falls in love will soon be humiliated. They will be torn down completely. I can't stand that. It is too pathetic. Do you intend to live your whole life without interacting with others? I just told you. That is the logic of the strong. If I am just going to get hurt, it is better to not have real feelings for anyone. I don't want to be looked down or laughed at. I don't want to be mocked. I refuse to be hurt! That is why I will not complete my script. If I finish it, there will be people who criticize it. I refuse to stand in the ring. I will not fight. Therefore, I will not lose. So? "So?" Is that life enjoyable? After pursuing enjoyment, where did that lead you now? How pathetic. You won't lose if you don't stand in the ring. But you won't win either. Who will I win against? You won't say something as clichéd as "yourself," will you? If I don't write, no one will criticize me. If I don't fight, I won't lose. It's that simple. Mr. Tamura... chose my project. Not yours. He chose mine. You need a good cornerman to stand in the ring. But Mr. Tamura had no interest in your fight. In other words, you are fighting alone. Even if you pretend to be a teacher and stand in front of a class, in the end, you are finished as a scriptwriter. You always look away from the fact that you are a failing scriptwriter. All you do is make excuses, like saying that the modern TV industry is too suffocating. You lost to me. You were filled with jealousy. That is pathetic, isn't it? I lost. I know that. Perhaps, I will lose many times. But I am fine with that. Listen, Ito. How much do you know about the women you wrote about? What do you know? You don't know anything. You only see what you want. You only pursue what you want. You. Always you. Someday, you will become empty. That... isn't love. At first, I laughed as I wrote about those women for being so desperate and unsightly. But I was wrong. They are... me. We all don't want to be hurt. I understand. It is scary to be hurt. "Boring." "Uninteresting." "No talent." "Incoherent." "Her time is over." Of course, those words hurt me. But listen, Ito. I will write. No matter how much I get hurt, I will write. Rio! You wouldn't answer your phone. Rio? Whatever is in here might be rotten. Are you afraid? But I must open it. It's so clean. Nothing rotted, Rio. Of course not, right? NEWCOMER AWARD RIO YAZAKI I read your script that won the award. Thank you. The plot of this Tokyo Doll House series sounds really interesting. -Thank you. -But your dialogue needs work. What? See, Yuri says "I loved this place." Yuka says, "Even though you'll get married, we're still friends." Those lines are too weak. Too weak? In this situation, the viewer will expect this sort of line. So I think you should reorder these lines. Reorder? Yes. Hello. I am headed there now. Yes. The story is finished. Yes. Misaki? Subtitle translation by James Burns
