That's good. Good. What a piece of shit. Let's move it. OK? That's good. Like I was saying, I'll go on unemployment for a year and make 90% easy, right? I can still do small jobs here and there. You get it? Then after a year, when my unemployment runs out, you give me your spot and you take it easy for a year. Then we start over again. Hang on. - You don't get it. - Yes, I do. If I understand you right, we work every other year… Right. …but get paid the whole time. You got it, man! Hey! You're not a complete idiot! - Hey… - Oh, right. Shit. Come in, madam. As you can see, it's an old apartment. But any renovations you do, or that we do for you, - will be tax-deductible! - I certainly hope so. And it's an excellent location, I'm telling you. - What about renting? - That's no problem. - What about that chimney? - Oh, that will be gone. There's a big urban development project, flowers, etc. Do you have a renovation estimate? Yes, of course. Not in my head, but my secretary can give it to you later. - Did you see how she looked at you? - Stop it. You're onto something. Stop it. Be careful. They might hear us. - It could be something good! - Shh! Shut up. Madam, my advice would be to make up your mind as soon as possible. Yes. I'll talk to my husband tonight. Just call me tomorrow morning. - He won't be there, but I can tell you. - Excuse me. Can you give me your phone number again? - 747-15-73. - OK. 7, 4, 7, 1, 5, 7, 3. Yes. Here. Her husband won't be there tomorrow. You have some nerve… Ah! I think that's my daughter. Hurry up! I have dance class in 10 minutes. - Otherwise you take a taxi. - No, I'm coming! Surrounded, Walled in, Buried, we are surrounded, Surrounded We are in a circle I hope you haven't lost the key The key To this circle Stone Rolling stone gathers no moss, No moss The moss of respect, the moss of comfort The moss of the past The moss of death, the moss The moss Yes! And go! We will roll out of this circle Like a stone that takes the key To the fields To the fields So, Thierry. When's the wedding? Late September, early October. Right, kitten? Did you see that? I lost them! Thankfully! I don't think you lost them for long. Where did they come from? Go faster! Hey. - Do you know him? - You're funny. How would I know? Ask him nicely to take off his helmet. I'm sure that's what he's waiting for. Very funny. - Hey! - Can't you turn here? Turn, turn… You think I can just turn? I can't turn! Did you see that? Why did you follow that car? You didn't warn us. What's with you, man? Are you crazy? Warn us next time you lose it. A crush. I have a crush on that girl. Well, you can kiss your crush goodbye. The ride stops here. Quit joking for five minutes. Why? Wouldn't we be better off in there than somewhere else? Have you seen yourself? With your face and our clothes? You think they'll let you in there? Look. In here. Here we go! Is that cotton? Yeah, it's cotton. Then T-shirts for everyone! Let's go, Daddy-O. Oh, how cute! Here you go. Hello, you. I can tell you take dance classes. And I can tell you don't. How did you know that? Just a feeling. - Do you want a drink? - I'm coming. Do you ever ride on the Champs-Élysées with a big blue helmet and 3,000 friends with you? - How did you know that? - Just a feeling. Bye. Hey. Was that the girl in the car? I can't hide anything from you. You make friends fast, man. My dear, if you keep coming home at 4:00am, I think your exams… Don't worry. I'll pass them. Hello? Well? There was no one home. I'll call back later. Not only did you come home at 4:00 am, but on a motorcycle! So? What's the problem? Are you spying on me? - Do I know the young man? - No. Can I ask what he does? Am I dreaming? Do I ask who you work with at the bank? As long as you live here, it's our right and responsibility to know where she is! Laurent is a plumber. Do you mean he runs a sanitation company? No. He's a plumber. He does the welding. A plumber! Oh, that's very interesting. I happen to have a sink that's not working. Can you ask him to come? With your daughter's connections, maybe we won't have to wait six months. Sure, I'll tell him. I'll tell him tonight. Private school, tennis at the club, skiing at Courchevel, birthdays at Maxim's… And she ends up with a plumber. I was going almost 200km/hr and those asshole bikers were still on my ass! So I stepped on the gas and around 220km/hr, I started to lose them. And you didn't see them after that? Yes, at the tollbooth. Did you forget to tell him to come fix the toilet? Everyone in their place. The ice is broken! What do they say about the number 12 in Lotto magazine? 12? 12… 12? Ah! 12… "Looking good. Should come up soon. "Often seen alongside 42." Yes, that's what I thought. What about 14? Lotto Weekly says it's not looking good. It hasn't come up much and they don't see it coming up soon. How do the newspapers know all that? It's mathematical. They do it with computers. Something's wrong with Laurent. Haven't you noticed the past few days he's been… He's at that age. It will pass. Don't worry. If we could just win… We could buy the La Rosa house and help him out. Quit dreaming. If you want to win, we have work to do. Come on. Hello. Ah! I was expecting you. Have I seen you somewhere? - Yes. The apartment on Rue de Miromesnil. - Ah! Yes, that's right. I remember you. In the end, we didn't buy it. That was a good decision. It was a dump. If you say so, I have even fewer regrets. It's this way. It's the bathroom sink. - Here. - Excuse me. It's clogged. I've tried everything. Nothing worked. - Now it's your turn. - I'll take a look, madam. It's not very interesting. Why not? I'm interested in anything having to do with Dominique. So her boyfriend… Tell me. Are you looking at Dominique's boyfriend or the young guy from the apartment? The man who calls and hangs up. It wasn't me who called. And you're shy, too! If it weren't for Dominique… No, listen. Let's be serious. I want to know who my daughter is seeing. That's normal. It looks like she has good taste. So let's be friends. Yes. Let's be friends. Do you know Dominique is not my daughter? I know. So my mother is in Colorado with her new husband and my father married Hélène. Do you see your mother often? Enough. - She can get free flights. - OK. Everyone else gets things for free. I'm the only working fool. I work too. School, dancing… - Studying takes work, you know. - I know. I do it too. Really? - I take night classes. - In what? A bit of everything. Technology, business law and applied math. You little sneak. You didn't tell me that! What did Thierry study? Oh, something vaguely related to business and banking. Your parents must love him. My parents might, - but I don't. - Well, he's trying his best to get you to. Oh, you animal! You know you look pretty good. I'm in a meeting. Don't disturb me. PROBABILITIES FOR THE NEXT LOTTERY DRAWING HIGHEST PROBABILITY: 7-18-32-38-42-46 Yes? I'm sure you have your hair pulled back today. I have a customer with an overdraft of 172.42 francs who wants to withdraw 200 francs. He says he knows you. Laurent Demaison, account number 5402M. I don't know him. I mean, I'm coming. You know I can never resist the pleasure of seeing you. Mr. Denoël is coming. Mr. Demaison. Oh, I see. I didn't know you were… a customer here. That's right. - How did you know… - I fixed the toilets. So it was Hélène… I mean, Mrs. Dupré-Granval… - Exactly. - Let me see. I see you have an overdraft of 172.42 francs. And a check for 107.18 francs came in this morning. Should I pay him, Mr. Denoël? Hang on… I'm sorry. It's not a lot of money, and it's the first time. Of course, but… Now with the new law on checks, we can't do whatever we want. Sir? This is Thierry. Sir, I have a Mr. Laurent Demaison here. Yes. He has an overdraft of 172.42 francs and would like to withdraw 200 francs. But we also just received a check for 107.18 francs. Denoël, don't bother me with… Yes, I know, sir. No, but this is… Laurent Demaison. Yes, the plumber. Your daughter's… Ah! OK. You should've said that right away. Send him to my office. I can't get any work done around here. The work never ends. Mr. Dupré-Granval will see you in his office on the fourth floor. - The clerk will take you. - Thank you. Now the boss is seeing people for overdrafts of 172.42 francs? I see people for less than that… Mr. Thierry! I already told you no. And you're engaged to Miss Dupré-Granval. Yes. I'll be the boss soon. Oh, you! Think about it and let me know this afternoon. I'm free tomorrow night. I'll ask Mr. Dupré-Granval about account number 5402M. Hello, sir. Do you know my daughter is engaged? No. Well, I'm telling you. Didn't my wife tell you? - No. - Well, it's not official, but… It might as well be. So tell me… You have an overdraft? - And a check came in this morning? - Yes, but it's not much. I know, my friend. I know. 3.7 million? Well, pay him. I know he has an overdraft. Now… What was I saying? Oh, yes! No, it's not much money, but it's a matter of principle. Do you know we're closely watched? I understand that. Are those your wife's ancestors? How did you guess that? People usually think they're mine. Yes. Sir? What do I do with the check for 107.18 francs, Laurent Demaison, account number 5402M? Pay it. And he can take his 200 francs. - Very well, sir. - But be careful next time. And when you come into a bank, take your hat off, at the very least. Micheline. Micheline, the little bank teller. - Yes. - I think he seduced her. It sounds like the only feather missing from his cap is Dominique. The only one missing is Dominique. Yes, but I'm there. And so am I. I'll get it, Manuella. - Hello, madam. - Hello. You again? Today it's the bathtub. In my bedroom. - I'll show you where it is. - No need. I know. - Goodbye, Mrs. Dupré-Granval. - Goodbye. It's fine. Yes, it's fine. But I wanted to see you. You could have called me. You wouldn't have come. Have a seat. Since I'm here, go ahead. My daughter, well, Dominique, likes you a lot. I even think she loves you. - Yes, but… - Let me finish. Dominique and I are very close. She listens to me, you know. She's practically engaged to Thierry. My husband likes the idea, and I must say I don't dislike it. And Thierry can take over the bank while all I can do is fix toilets. I knew you'd understand. - Understanding doesn't solve anything. - I'm not so sure. You're not? Thierry works in the bank, but he has no vision, while you are the opposite. - How do you know? - I can just tell! - You can learn banking, but the rest… - But I don't want to be a banker. I take night classes so I can have a little plumbing business. That's it. See! I was right. Listen, Laurent. If you want things to go well with Dominique, I think you have to get on my good side. And how do I do that? We have to be friends. - Demaison? - Yes. Phone call. - Hello? - Laurent? Yes. - How'd you find me? - Lucky guess. Will you pick me up from dance class and we can go eat? OK. No problem. But I have another class: Math in Action. So do I. I'll be done in an hour. I'll see you later then. I have to go. The teacher is coming. Bye. All right! We'll see what you remember from my first lesson on probability. Here. Pass these out. - Are these lottery tickets? - Yes. And they're an excellent exercise. One ticket per person. The first exercise is easy. What are the odds, when you fill out one ticket, of getting three numbers right? What are the odds of getting four, five and then six numbers and retiring in the sun? Get to work! You should be done by now. Yes? A one in 57 chance of getting three numbers right, a one in 1,032 chance of getting four numbers right, a one in 55,491 chance of getting five numbers right, and a one in 13,983,816 chance of getting all six numbers right. Correct! - Does everyone agree? - Yes. Sir, can you remind me how we figure that out? It's a combination of six numbers, three by three out of 49, six numbers, four by four, six numbers, five by five, and six numbers, six by six. Perfect! - Does everyone agree? - Yes. So you have around one chance in 14 million of guessing all six numbers. Coming here every night is a safer way of improving your future. In the meantime, I'll give you a little homework before we move on to the law of large numbers. You'll all fill out these tickets. You get eight chances, which will cost you eight francs, as I imagine you know. After the drawing, find out how much was bet in total. Taking into account the money that the Lottery retains and the taxes the government obviously takes out, calculate how many players guessed three correct numbers, how many players guessed four correct numbers, how many players guessed five correct numbers and how many players guessed six. I'll give you one free number. - What if we win? - If you win? You'll win the right to never have to see me again. I'll meet you at the café. - OK? - OK. Thank you. Could I borrow a pen? Thank you. You're playing the lottery now? No, I'm doing my homework. Your homework? Our math teacher asked us to calculate our chances of winning the lottery. Do you have a good chance of winning? - Can I help you? - What do you want? - Coffee. - Coffee for me too, please. Around one chance in 14 million. Give me a number from 1 to 49. - 23. - 23. 23. Why 23? Just because. - Thank you. - Thank you. Now I see why everyone plays. For a few francs, you buy a few hours of happiness until the draw. I have to go to a party at home. Come with me. Then I won't be so bored. Look at what I'm wearing! What about your parents? - Exactly. - What about Thierry? Kiss me. Ah, hello. Nice to meet you, sir. Thierry Denoël, my future son-in-law. Mr. and Mrs. Merret. Nice to meet you. Congratulations. I've seen you before at the bank. Mr. Denoël is one of my closest associates. Come in. Don't just stand there. Come on. Are you sure they won't mind? Because… My father told me to invite my friends. You're my only friend. Make yourself at home. He's in red with the Bank of France and he's my biggest customer. - How much is he worth? - 120, 150 million. Ah, I see. And you know… Did Dominique bring him? I don't know. She didn't tell me. It's… We'll have to do something. What a nice surprise, Laurent. - Dominique… - It was an excellent idea! My husband and I thought you wouldn't be interested in a reception like this. Obviously, otherwise… - Madam, I think the ice is in the kitchen. - Yes. No, I'd rather you stayed here. Very well, madam. Laurent, come help me. How nice of you to come say hello. Yes, I wanted to come. Hélène wants to talk to you. She's in the kitchen. - Really? - I think she needs your help. - Hélène. - Yes? I need to talk to you. Go ahead. Oh… - I think there's a problem with… - Hang on. - …my zipper. - Oh, it's nothing. There. Dominique! Dominique, listen to me! No! Don't touch me! You're such a loser! - You're a loser! - I didn't do anything! Let me explain! After that old song, here's the song that will be the hit of the summer! OK. That wasn't great, because the transition was all wrong. You have to wait for the transition, OK? I'll show you. Listen. Listen. You'll see. You have to wait for the second record to blend with the percussion before you transition. OK? - Yeah, you're right. - OK. For this special block, here's a new song that will be a hit in all the clubs this year. It's "Rain or Shine." - OK. See that? - Yes. - Should I do it like you? - No. Try not to imitate me too much. Be yourself. Have fun. Do a good transition and look at the people in the room, because everyone is watching you. - Really? - Yes. That's very important. OK. From the top. - So I can do whatever I want? - Yes. Do whatever you feel. - OK. - Can I start the music? Start the music. This is the hit song of the week. This is it! Straight from the USA. You'll love dancing to this. Yes… OK. That wasn't bad. See? That was very good. Come back tomorrow and we'll do it again, but that was good. Just be yourself, have fun and don't imitate me. - OK. - See you tomorrow. - I think I get it now. - OK. You'll see tomorrow. It'll be great. - Great. - Yeah. I think I've got it. Now, your turn, same transition. Hey. What's with the long face? It's over with Dominique. That's great. We can start partying again. She had you locked up for a while. Quit joking around. Come on. There's plenty of fish in the sea. No! Don't be an idiot. Come on. What an idiot. Hey… Come on. We're not done. Show him how we heat things up. We're not done. OK. I'm coming. No. Madam is not here. Neither is her daughter. Madam asks you to stop calling. Dominique does not want to see you again. Dominique, listen to me. Leave her alone. I'm here to keep you from bothering the lady. Could I see Mr. Denoël, please? Hello, Mr. Demaison. I'll call Mr. Denoël. Mr. Demaison is here. OK. Very well. Mr. Denoël isn't here. - Maybe you have an overdraft and… - Really? - Of how much? - 243.17 francs. 243.17 francs… OK. I'll try to get it. Not even three numbers, dammit. - The boss got four. - How do you know? Easy. He always plays his birthday: 2, 8, 19, 23. And his license plate number. Unfortunately, he has the wrong number. We could fix that. You want to change his license plate? No, but we could change the numbers. Look. - You'll give him a heart attack. - No! Do you know the number on his CX? - Yes. 32, 43… - And 92! - Yes. - OK. I'll replace 31 with 32, 47 with 43… - There. - Perfect. He won 83 million francs. Well, that's what he'll think. I'd give half that to be in his office. Sir, I have another request from the Circle Company. - Pay them. - But they still have an overdraft. Just pay them. - Sir… - Yes? A bad check. Why do checks always have to be good? Pay it. Pay them all. There you go! We skipped the 20s and there was one in there. - How much was it this time? - Don't ask… The big prize was 830 million. What? What did you say? If you saw your face, you'd run away. What's with you? Let him have his breakfast in peace. 830 million… I left my money for the month on the table. With three numbers, we won 12.80 francs. I don't believe you. When did you come home last night? Or this morning? I don't know when I came home, but I can tell you I woke up at 5:30 am. I fixed two bathtubs and a sink. You may wake up early but you shouldn't go to bed late. 2, 8, 19, 23, 31 and 47. If we'd made our little Xs a few millimeters next to where we put them, we'd have 830 million. - Don't tell me you played? - No. I'm just looking. When will you start getting serious? Now. I'm going to do my homework. Sorry. Well, pick it up! I don't know the winner's name. He didn't have to put his name on the ticket… How could I remember his face? I sell thousands of tickets here. 830 million! What would you do if you won that amount? I've never thought about it! But if it ever happens to me, I'm sure I'll have a few ideas. First, a vacation. A nice little trip around the world with the wife. And there's a big convenience store on Place des Ternes I'd like to buy. I'd have given my son the rest. A car accident last year… Unfortunately, there're things you can't buy. Cut. That's enough. Thank you. Give me an espresso with milk, please. He's got to come get his 830 million. - We'll see who it is. - No. I don't pay the jackpots. That's at headquarters. - On Rue de… - Rue D'Aguesseau. 8:30am to noon, 14:30 to 16:30. Remember that. You never know. One day you might need it. You again. I have to talk to your boss. A Ricard! I can't tell you who he is. It's very important. I'll make it worth your while. Do you know how hard it is to find a real private detective? I'll say… I'll say I found the address in the phone book. OK. You can't do anything to the boss. But… Leave the girl alone, OK? No. Let's wait for the liquidation. I know 200 million isn't nothing! But remember that I'm somebody. OK. Let's talk next week. I told you, René. The stock market is risky. You'll lose millions again. Of new francs, as usual. It's my job, Hélène. Yes, but it's my money. Somewhere in France, someone has won 830 million but doesn't want anyone to know. Look around you. It could be your neighbor, a relative, or even your husband or wife… DON'T WAIT UNTIL TUESDAY TO BUY YOUR TICKETS 1ST FLOOR: JACKPOT PAYMENTS JACKPOT PAYMENTS Mr. Demaison. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Mr. Demaison, in accordance with your wishes, your identity will be kept strictly confidential. And we honored your request. 830,435,242 francs. They're all yours. Do you have something to carry it in? Yes, absolutely. Well then, these two gentlemen will escort you home. That's not necessary. No one would ever think… Be careful. Hey, Grandpa! Lend me your money and I'll pay you back next time I see you. Hurry up or I'll make you bleed! Let's go! You can have it. It's crap. Check out the little guy. Oh! That's a nice leather jacket! What size are your shoes? - 41. - Hurry up! Give me your boots! So cute! Get up! His ass looks just like mine! Give me your pants. - Come on! - Oh, so cute… You want my dirty laundry too? He thinks we're stupid. Forget him. Let's switch here. There are often cops at the next stop. What did you do this time? - I got robbed on the subway. - And what's that? My dirty uniform. You have a letter on the table. As you know, this week's lottery jackpot was won by someone in Paris: 830 million francs. Our reporter at the lottery headquarters might just introduce you to the winner. No, Michel Bénézit, I won't introduce you to the winner. I can tell you there was only one winner, which was all the chairman - would tell me. - Yes, there was one winner, but I can't tell you anything else except that he just left here with 830 million in cash. - In cash? - Yes. At his request, we bent the rules a bit. We usually pay by check, but this person asked me to pay cash. - That must have been a big stack of bills. - Yes. Can you imagine? Holding 830 million francs in cash in your hands? Yeah… I can imagine it. …or if a family member moves into a mansion on Avenue Foch, don't jump to the conclusion that he robbed an armored car or held up the Bank of France. What is this all about, Bernard? Our client is Mr. Dupré-Granval. Yes. The young man seems to be having problems. But I think he can pay. We'll see. Miss, let Mr. Demaison in. Normally, I'm not allowed to talk to you. - My client is… - I know. But maybe you can help me. Our services are rather costly. Is that enough to get you to listen to me? Have a seat. Thank you. So. I love Dominique Dupré-Granval and she loves me. The problem is that her mother, or stepmother, to be precise, and Mr. Denoël conspired to make me look… like a jerk, an asshole. So I want you to help me fix the situation. Mr. Denoël is supposed to marry Dominique. I know. But she won't. Dominique will marry me. Is that it? On top of your fees and expenses, there will be 200,000 francs, or 20 million old francs, in it for you if we succeed. Go on. VIDEO RECORDER How's life? - Good. - Are you OK, man? These old things are so heavy. You know we're working today? Really? Are you on strike or what? The guy who won 830 million in the lottery - is me. - Yeah, right. And the guy who was just named prime minister is me. This is 2 million. I have 828 million more at home. Are you joking? Dan, we're done with this shit! We're done busting our asses! It's over! We're done working for peanuts! And I'm also planning on buying a majority stake in the club. Yes. I know they're having money problems. And we might need a DJ, but I don't know who to pick… I'm telling you. You won't find anyone - better than me! - Well, if you say so, you've got the job. How do you know where I am? My friend, that's part of the job. I must be able to reach you at all times. I just learned that Dominique suddenly left for Biarritz. Unfortunately, we are not responsible for her protection there, so it may be best if you tried… When is the next flight? The regular flight times won't work, so I've organized your transportation. It's mine, young man! I called this taxi. What's your problem? People like you take the subway! Or the bus. - Mr. Demaison? - Yes? Hey, Dan. Don't leave me all alone. Come on. I'll write you a note. Fashion. Go on, asshole. Where are we going? Le Bourget, sir. Your plane is waiting. Hello? Yes, everything's fine. You have to talk to Dominique. She's marrying Mr. Denoël at the end of the week. We'll do everything we can here, but it's up to you. I understand. The driver will give you an envelope with the contacts we've made for you there and the telephone numbers where you can reach us. Good luck. Thank you. This is good. Come on. Here you go. You have to gather your strength. - Isn't that right, driver? - Certainly, sir. Cheers! Would you like a little music? Music is a great idea. Isn't it? Not bad, yes. - Dan… - Oh, man. Oh, darling. We run into each other all the time but never meet! - Did you see the driver's look? - Shut up, asshole. - Madam. - Hi. That's not straight. Hello. The butler at the house is one of our guys. Dominique arrived last night and should be staying here three or four days. We have a plan for you to meet her in the right conditions. Oh, my God! It's our contact, the butler. Dominique is leaving for Paris after receiving a phone call. Quick! Follow that plane! Dominique is marrying Mr. Denoël at 10:00 tomorrow morning at city hall. The religious ceremony will take place at 11:00 at Saint-Honoré-d’Eylau. But… We have one last plan, but its success will depend on you. It's over. Over! It's her that I want! I don't care about 830 million! Calm down! My colleagues and I have worked day and night to come up with one last plan. Here it is. This is what we'll use to play our last card. Sorry. I don't understand. Do you know that the Dupré-Granvals own a video recorder? Yes. - In the living room, connected to the TV. - Yes. They also own a black and white video camera that they rarely use but that can be used to film without artificial lighting. I still don't understand. He still doesn't understand. You know we're still responsible for protecting Dominique in Paris. Bernard put batteries in the camera, and with this device, you can remotely operate the camera and video recorder. We'll get you into the apartment and it will be up to you to get an explanation out of whoever you run into. What if it's Dominique? Unfortunately, she's not in Paris. We don't know where she is, and it's possible they might be onto us. OK… Let's say I get Hélène… Mrs. Dupré-Granval or her husband to say things… that prove I was set up. How will that help? That's the last part of the operation. One thing at a time! - Time is running out! - Yes. Go home and stay close to the phone. The operation is about to begin. What… What's going on? What a disaster! And Madam isn't here. Hello? A leak? What's the address? Yes. OK. I'll be right there. Don't worry. I know where it is. - Where did you find that number? - It was by the phone. And who told you to call? There was a flood, madam. I have to replace the faucet. Excuse me. Did you imagine yourself, Laurent Demaison, a plumber, marrying Dominique, heiress to one of France's largest private banks? You must have known everything had to be put in order, Laurent. That's why the day of the reception, Thierry and I did what we had to do. - Yes. - What you had to do? - Yes. - Yes. Come on. You're not capable. You're not capable of fighting us. Hélène only put her arms around your neck in the kitchen so Dominique would surprise you. And you made sure to send her there at the right moment? Exactly. We can't hide things from you. You might call it "a set-up." We call it "a success." - A success? - Yes. Yes. That will be 99.45 francs. Really? No, keep the change. And don't try to see Dominique again. She doesn't want to see you anyway. See you soon. No, I don't think so. Ah, Mr. Demaison. Good timing. We were just about to write to you. - Really? - About your overdraft. 269.24 francs. If you don't pay it, your account will be closed. That's why I'm here. How much is your deposit? - 8,110,000 francs. - Business must be good. But we no longer use old francs. So 81,100 francs… No. 8,110,000 francs. No, Mr. Demaison. 8,110,000 francs would make 811 million old francs. Can you imagine? Yes, I can. Do you have the check? I have cash. WAITING ROOM Dominique's bodyguard is one of the guests. He'll hit the remote control at just the right moment. You will continue the line of one of the greatest families in finance, in France and even Europe. But never forget this: money cannot buy happiness. What's he saying? He said, "Money cannot buy happiness." We'll see about that! Please stand. Mr. Thierry Denoël, do you wish to marry Dominique Dupré-Granval, here before you? Did you really imagine yourself, Laurent Demaison, a plumber, marrying Dominique, heiress to one of the largest private banks in France? You should have known, Laurent, that everything had to be put back in order. That's why at the reception, Thierry and I did what we had to do. - What you had to do? - Yes. You're not capable. You're not capable of fighting us. Hélène only put her arms around your neck in the kitchen so that Dominique could surprise you. And you sent her in at the right moment? Yes. We can't hide anything from you. You might call it "a set-up." We call it "a success." Dominique! Dominique… This is Dominique Dupré-Granval. We've decided to get married. Get married? Don't worry! I'll explain. My God… So young! So fast! - What about your job? - We've thought about it. I work. I earn a living, and I'll continue to do so. But to get married, you need to be established in life! - You need money. - I have it. With what you earn as a plumber? I don't think this girl is the type who will be happy with that. Don't worry. We'll manage. I'll work. We're not the first to start out without a fortune. But I have a fortune! Did you do something stupid? - You didn't rob a bank, did you? - I robbed a banker. Laurent, this is serious. What's this all about? Well… The guy who won 830 million in the lottery is me. That's a good one! How could you win? You never play! I played once. And for my wedding, I've decided to give you a present. Here. The La Rosa house is yours. Look! There. The little jerk didn't even tell us! You're welcome. You sure knew what you were doing. But I didn't know. I was like you. Hello? Who is it? It's Mrs. Tanieul. She has a leak in her bathroom and wants to know what to do. Tell her to let it run. DUPRÉ-GRANVAL BANK Do you know I'm the laughing stock of Paris? Dupré-Granval looks like a clown. As for your little movie at city hall… Make me a copy, will you? I'm sorry, but I had no choice. Yes? Yes. I told you it's not a problem! I'll make the payment as planned! Yes! You have my word! The payment is 2 million. New francs, of course. But you don't have that, and you can't borrow it from the bank. So you played the futures market, at your own risk. The supervisory board won't like that. How do you know all that? I'll explain everything. My honor is trampled in public on the day of my daughter's wedding, and in a few days, I'll be in a financial scandal. What did I do to God to deserve this? Nothing. It's God who will do something for you. I don't feel like laughing. OK, I had a finger in every pie, but I put money in everyone's pockets! They can't just abandon me! You know they'll all abandon you. Except God. Your God is starting to get on my nerves. There's 8,110,000 francs, Mr. Demaison. 811 million old francs. Yes. I won the 830 million in the lottery. I just deposited it in cash. Why in cash? I wanted to touch 830 million. To feel it! A check is abstract, but 16,600 500-franc bills is really something, let me tell you. I counted them. But I have a question for you. How can a banker have money problems? - It's the straw. - 200 million - for you is not… - It's the straw that broke the camel's back. But now the camel's back - is repaired. - I… May I ask why you… I don't want my future father-in-law being talked about in the news. Can you imagine? "Dupré-Granval, famous banker, charged with fraud "and breach of trust?" Future father-in-law and charged… Future father-in-law, yes. Charged, no. That's… And what do you want? As a deposit, you'll give me your share of the bank, of course, and everyone will be happy. Mr. Morel? Oh. You're his secretary? In his car? I'm in his car. I get his secretary, who says she'll see if he's there. They must think I'm a real idiot. Well? Oh, good. He'll call me back? I'm in my car. You have my number? Good. I can't wait to see his face when I pay him 200 million francs, and in cash. Just to piss him off. Yes? No, this is his assistant. It's Morel. Hold, please. Mr. Dupré-Granval is on another line. We'll teach that one a lesson. Got him. My dear Dupré, it's good to have a finger in every pie and even better to fill everyone's pockets, but there are days when you also have to put your foot down. Put your foot down? It's amazing. The lights are perfect. Dupré, you went all out, as usual! Oh, no. It's nothing. It's my pleasure. And you only get married once. - What does your son-in-law do? - He's in… sanitation. Sanitation. He's doing very well. I put a lot of money into his company. I'm doing well… You'd be doing even better if you started dancing! "Money can't buy happiness." "Lucky at cards, unlucky in love." Who said all that nonsense? He's not bad, that boy. He won me over. He won everything. Subtitle translation by: Kristina Jackson
