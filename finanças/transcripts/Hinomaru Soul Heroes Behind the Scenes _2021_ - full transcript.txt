Japan won the silver medal. This result is very regrettable Let's go over. Sometimes it happens. A silver medal is impressive enough. Keep your head up, Harada. Hey! I'm sorry. You're being funny. What's with that face? Crying or laughing, choose one. This is what I look like. Come on. Nishikata... What are you doing, you idiot?

(Yukie, pick up the phone.) - Even if that's true, you could still... Okay. Nishikata. What's a gold medal? Hello, this is Aitoku B&B. A gold medal? When did you learn that word? Mom said so.

The first one is Miyahira Hideharu Miyahira's victory in the HTB Cup is the key reason As for the last one, considering the achievements of this period so far, we have decided... Suda Kenji In addition to his superb strength Suda has competed in many Winter Olympics since Alberta He is a seasoned veteran Together with the previously announced 6 players, these 2 competitors, Miyahira and Suda, will form the Winter Olympics team.

Ski Jump representative members selection These members will make the strongest team ever! The Japanese team won the silver medal at the Lillehammer Winter Olympics. All of Japan felt very sad at that time. This time round, the gold medal is in reach. Why am I the only one... Harada Masahiko Thank you for your hard work. I'm a little tired. But I'll be fine. I just can't compete in the Winter Olympics. It's not like I'm going to die. I'll just try my best the next time. Welcome home. I'm back. I am at the Nagano Winter Olympic Stadium, Hakuba Ski Jumping Arena. The whole country is looking forward to the gold medal in ski jumping. The local villagers of Hakuba Village are also giving their full support to the competition. Their talking about the "Jing" medal. It's not a Jing medal. It's a gold medal. The gold medal will be awarded to the person who jumps the farthest. It will be awarded to the person who sees the most beautiful scenery. - Really? - Yeah. I'm sorry I couldn't show you the gold medal. - Hey. - Yeah? Let's go out to eat today. - Really? - Yeah. -What do you want to eat, Shingo? - What do you want to eat? -Tuna. - Tuna? Tuna? Coming. You want to eat tuna, huh? In fact, I'm running a team of test jumpers at Nagano. Test jumper team? Kanzaki-san? Is that strange? Test jumpers have to test jump every morning To ensure the safety of the platform. It's not glamorous, but it's dangerous. But it is an important task to ensure the smooth running of the Winter Olympics So Nishikata You can be a test jumper too. What? You have to be there this week. Get ready. Wait, why me? You're not busy anyway. I'm free, but... But why should I be behind the scenes? I've been working towards a gold medal for the last four years. I won't be a test jumper. That's up to you. But that's like turning down an offer from the ski federation. Don't you want to keep jumping? Even if you're going to retire, it's good to be nice to the federation. You'll still have to make a living after you retire, right? It's not easy, with kids so young. Are you kidding? I'm not retiring. I can still jump. Sorry. Please leave. This is the shape of the sun. Mom, I made a sun. TOKIO Don't fall down Just hold on like this TOKIO TOKIO fly up to the sky Drink more, everyone. More, more, more. 10 bottles. 10 more bottles. Okay! Wow, it's Nishikata Jinya. Look! It's a shame about the Winter Olympics. Yes, so today... We're going to drink our sorrows away! But I can't accept it. You didn't make it, but Harada did. That's because, previously it was all his fault. If it were me, I would have chosen you. Okay, stop it. What? What's wrong? What's wrong? What a waste, they have no vision Life isn't just about the Olympics. Isn't it? Yeah, it's not all about the Olympics. Right! Cheers! - Drink up today. - Drink! Nishikata Jinya 13 years old 1981.1.25 Longest unbeaten record 63.0m Nozawa Onsen Jump Jinya, come on! Wait a minute. It's okay, just go for it. Ready! Damn it! Damn it! Damn it! Damn it! Damn it! Damn it... Yukie This was your first jump. You've brought me here before. I'm...ready to give up jumping Life has its ups and downs. I've thought about it. I'm going to be a test jumper. And then retire. We'll live together as a family. It is what it is, after all. It is what it is? No, no, don't read too much into it. For me, being a normal father, that's what I want. But, Jinya... Do you still remember what you said to me when you proposed? "I may not be able to be with you all the time." "I may not be a good father." "But..." "Considering how much I love jumping" "If you looked at me on the jumping platform, you would understand" "Although I may not be a good husband" "I hope you will marry me" I don't know if I still like jumping anymore Then why don't you just turn down the test jumper job? Since you don't like it anymore? You don't want to be a test jumper, do you? It's not that simple. If I burn my bridges, how can we make a living? It'll affect you, too. This has nothing to do with me. If you are worried about work, we can run the bed and breakfast together It's not so simple It's not simple. I didn't say it was easy either. Even if you can't be with me all the time. Even if you are not a good father. If you can be happy on the jumping platform. I think it's okay. I don't want to see you suffer, thinking that you have no choice but to jump. 5 days until the Nagano Winter Olympics. There's two weeks till the event. Until then, we will live together here. In this Nagano Olympics, it's an important event for the future of Japanese ski jumping. Although we are behind the scenes, don't forget that this is an important job to ensure the success of the competition. Yes, sir. Okay, let's get to know each other. Whoever wants to go first can start. My name is Fukuda Yoshiharu. I'm honored to be appointed as a test jumper this time. I'm very nervous, but I'll do my best. I'm a sophomore at Otaru Technical High School, Kobayashi Yoshiko. I've always wanted to participate in the Nagano Winter Olympics. I'm very excited just to be here. I may not be good enough But with my soul and passion for ski jumping, I will not lose to anyone. Please take care of me. This is the first time I've seen a female competitor But she's so cute. Isn't she? I might be a girl, but don't give me special treatment just because of that. Okay, okay. My name is Takahashi Ryuji. My hearing is not good. Since I was born, I've been unable to hear. But if you look me in the eye, slow down the speed of speech, I can understand everyone's words through my lips. Wouldn't it be dangerous to be deaf? By the way My best distance is 134 meters. That's impressive. - Next. - Okay. Minamikawa? I'm Minamikawa Takashi from the Hakuba Village Ski Club. It's regrettable that I couldn't be part of the delegation this time. But I've changed my mind and adjusted my mood. I want to be the unsung hero of this gold medal for Japan. Everyone, let's unite together Let's make sure the Olympics go smoothly. Okay, the last one, the Nishikata. Yes. I'm Nishikata Jinya. Wow, a real medalist. But why is he a test jumper? I should be the oldest among you. I'll try my best to be a role model for everyone. Please take care of me. Please take care of me. We're leaving at 6:30 tomorrow. No alcohol. Do you understand? Yes. I didn't expect you to be here. That should be my line, Nishikata. The room is really small. Everyone else is packed in. And there's no alternate delegation like us. Nishikata, why did you agree to be a test jumper? Of course, I wanted to support Japan behind the scenes to win a medal. Here we go again. It's just to save face for the ski federation, isn't it? I know, that's what I'm thinking too. In your introduction, you sounded all bright and shiny. As long as I don't get hurt, I still have a chance anyway. - Good morning. - Good morning. Takahashi, get up. Taka... That's right, he can't hear us. Get up! Takahashi! Get up! I overslept. The day of a test jumper starts early. We had to leave the dormitory before dawn and walk to the competition site. Hey, who told you to walk so leisurely? Run! Faster! You're kidding! Kanzaki! The job of a test jumper, is to remove the snow from the tracks using our skis. Grinding, grinding. Grinding out the route Go! Until it's safe for the competitors to jump. No stopping, jumping continously. No applause, no cheers. No records, no memories. This is the life during the Olympic Games, day in and day out.. Lean your upper body forward a little more. Kobayashi, step a little harder on your feet. I'm not kidding. Do it, or you'll get it from me! Kobayashi, answer me! Do you hear me, Kobayashi? Come in! Give me the walkie-talkie, please. - Got it? -Yes. - Come on, get up there and jump. Yes, I'm sorry. Doesn't feel like a jumping competition, does it? How can you be serious on a test jump? Hey, where are you going? If you don't rest properly, you'll get hurt again. 3 days to go until the Winter Olympics. Next we will interview the Hinomaru jump team who arrived at the competition venue. Please take care of me. Harada, how is your condition? Good, very good! You did well in the World Cup, didn't you? And Funaki? I'm feeling not bad. As expected of you all. Leader Kasai, please tell us your goal. As long as we jump normally, it's fine. I hope you can surpass your limits. And Saito? I'll definitely concentrate on my performance. Thank you. I have a few more questions for you. First of all, for the regular individual track... Are you sure you don't mind sitting here? You don't need to ask me that. How many times has she jumped today? She's pushing herself too hard, just for test jumps. Go. Hey, hey! Kobayashi! Yoshiko! Are you okay, Kobayashi? Are you okay? Does it hurt anywhere? Kobayashi! Can you move? I'm fine, I'm sorry. Are you okay? Yes, she said she's fine. I'm fine. That's great. I'm so sorry. Kobayashi, leave the team immediately and go back to Otaru. - Kanzaki, you shouldn't be doing that - It's my fault. I'll try harder. Please let me continue test jumping. Please. Please. Go home today. Kobayashi. Overtraining can be counterproductive Nishikata. I saw it. Don't listen to Kanzaki... I don't want to lose. Wherever I go, I'll be underestimated just because I'm a girl. I have to be better than anyone else. Yeah, but this isn't a competition either. You have to conserve your strength properly. What do you mean by "properly"? Even if it's behind the scenes, it's an important Olympics for me. Nishikata-san, you probably don't understand. Yeah, that's right. You should have already won the gold medal. This is beneath you, isn't it? The day before the Nagano Winter Olympics Opening Ceremony Where are you going? The wind is too dangerous. I won't jump. Just because of a little wind? You're just trying to be lazy. I know all about it. You have been lazy. So don't do anything to get in our way. Why so serious? It's just test jumping. It's not worth it to get hurt because of that. I'm not like you guys. I'm going to the next Olympics. Minamikawa. You will jump first. What's wrong? Hurry up and jump! I can't do it I'm sorry. Wait...Minamikawa! That's all you've got, after all! If today was the day of the competition, your behavior would be a disgrace to Japan. He was too scared to jump. He still can't get over the fear of getting injured. Listen carefully, this is not an ordinary competition. It's the Olympics. And we are the hosts again after Sapporo* (*Sapporo was host to Winter Olympics in 1972) The world is focused on Japan. The athletes are all under pressure and fighting to the death. The future of Japanese ski jumping is at stake. Don't think this is just a normal behind-the-scenes job. If you don't know what you're doing, get out now! For the sake of Japan, for the sake of the future of jumping. Is this so important? You should consider the feelings of Minamikawa He's been working hard for the Olympics so far. And so what? What about the feelings you think we should have to be test jumpers? Are you trying to say that a silver medalist shouldn't be doing such a thing? When you won the silver medal, there were test jumpers just like us. Of course I know. Nishikata-san! Come back, Nishikata. We continue. Yes. It's fine when the weather is good. But, whenever I feel the wind, I remember the jump where I got injured. Minamikawa, let's have a drink today. I stole Mr. Kanzaki's whiskey. Nicely done, Takahashi. I'm impressed with you. I've been pissed at him for a long time too. Let's drink it all. No, don't. If you drink it all, you'll be exposed. Just pour some oolong tea or something back. Wow, that's devious! Drink some. Okay. Now then. Cheers! Cheers! Nishikata I'd like to hear about your time in Lillehammer. Why do you suddenly want to hear this? Because the Winter Olympics in Lillehammer was legendary. I don't remember much about it. Anyway, I was mostly in a daze. But... At the moment of landing, I heard cheers. It was as if the ground was shaking with cheers. And that is the moment, I will never forget. Amazing I'm so envious. Because I can't hear the cheers. I'm sorry. It's okay. Please don't mind. But... You're always happy when you jump, right? Because of this, my life has a lot of limitations But when I am in the air, I am free. The joy of being in the air? I have forgotten about such things . Nishikata-san Why did you choose ski jumping? I gave up everything... Because I've always been jumping for the sake of gold medals What the hell am I doing here? Hold his nose. 1998, February 7 Nagano Olympics Opening Ceremony Today is February 7th. With the whole world watching the opening ceremony of the 18th Winter Olympics is being held at Minami Nagano Sports Park. This is the last Winter Olympics opening ceremony of the 20th century. The number of participating countries is 72, the largest ever. This kid He said he wanted to go to the Olympics. Jinya is not around again. I didn't know when he's become so fond of ski jumping. Really? If you come and watch, I feel like I can do very well. Yeah, thanks. I gotta go. Good night. Good night. Good job. [Yukie] I don't want to see you suffer, thinking that you have no choice but to jump. The much-anticipated ski jumping competition will begin today. The first event will be the normal hill individual competition. Will Japan be able to win a medal? Go for it, Japan! Also, the most notable competitor is Funaki Kazuyoshi. He's had an amazing season. The test jumps are over The competition is about to start Harada Masahiko Smiles for the Gold Normal hill individual competition How was the jump? The jump is very good. Still going on, still going on. Good! The results are in. Silver is in the bag. Funaki won the silver medal. Great "victory pose". He has the audience in his sights. Funaki's [Silver] jump The second jump that brought him back from the dead Wait, what are you doing? Let's go! Stop it! Come on. Wh-what's going on? Thank you for taking care of my daughter. I'm Yoshiko's father. She came here without my knowledge. While I was away on business. She became a test jumper without permission. I'm sorry for the trouble my daughter caused you. Yoshiko, let's go. I said no. I'm not going back. What are you talking about? Girls aren't supposed to do ski jumping. You've never even seen me. You never wanted to see me compete. Stop it! And you're just a test jumper. You're the worst! I don't want to see you anymore. Did you hide it from your father? Because even if I told him the truth, he wouldn't have approved. My dad was always against me ski jumping. And he never came to see me compete. I'm not in pain anymore. What's wrong? So what if I want to drink? Your father must also be... afraid of his daughter's ski jumping. He's scared. That's why he's afraid to watch. Even if that's the case, that has nothing to do with me. Is the job of a test jumper that important to you? I'm also aiming for the Olympics. I know, there's no women's ski jumping in the Olympics. So I definitely won't be able to compete in the Olympics. Even if I can jump farther than the men, it's useless. But knowing that I won't be able to participate, makes me look forward to the Olympics even more. I really envy the men who can aim for the Olympics. That's why, to be chosen as a test jumper, I was really happy. I get to jump in Nagano. I get to jump in the Olympic Games. No matter what people say, I'm not going to give up. Until then, when women's ski jumping becomes an official Olympic sport... (I will put in my) soul and passion! I see. Nishikata-san Please teach me ski jumping. What? Please. Okay. Alright! Thank you. Oolong tea. Abe, keep your back up. Yes, sir. Nishikata-san, please take a look at my simulation. Kobayashi, move the upper part of your body forward in one breath. Okay. Great, don't forget what you just felt. Okay One more time One more time. Nishikata-san I also want to do my best. So, Please advise me. What? At this rate, my ski jumping career will be over. How can I overcome my fear and jump? I see... If you are so afraid... How about a drink before jumping? No, you're not taking it seriously. I was just kidding. But, I've been there before. It's not easy to erase the fear you've experienced. So, how did you do it? Next is number 110. Nishikata Jinya. Nishikata Jinya. For the first time ever, I was jumping for someone else. If the desire to jump is greater than the fear, you can definitely jump too. What does that mean? Who is that person? Nishikata-san What should I do? Takahashi, you have nothing to correct. If I had to say, it's the sound of your snoring. Snoring? Snoring. That's right, I can even hear it from the hallway! N-o-i-s-y! It's so noisy. Those who are ready go up first Yes, sir. Damn it! Damn it! Are you kidding me? Kasai! I didn't get selected for the team competition. My Olympic career is over. Don't you want to watch the games? How can I watch it? I'm going back to Hokkaido soon. Harada. Well done Harada in the 136m (Large hill individual competition) [Bronze] Congratulations on your first medal. Thank you. The day before the ski jumping team competition (You made a big jump in the second jump of the competition) The test jumps will be finished tomorrow? You did a great job. That jump... Test Jumper waiting room It finally gave me a sense of relief. Tomorrow's team competition I'm really excited about it. But before the battle of the century. The medal that Harada got yesterday is very important. After all, there's the stain of the loss at Lillehammer. As the weakest one to go first, Harada-san was under a lot of pressure. Jumping with Hinomaru on your back, how does it feel? I can't even imagine it. Maybe that's what it's like to jump with soul and passion. You're making fun of me, right? I'm just kidding. I see... Hinomaru Soul. What? That's how you feel when you jump with the Hinomaru on your back. What is this? That's a good point. For me, the team competition is everything. I've been working hard for four years. For the team competition tomorrow, we must win the gold medal I'm going to make it up to you. Harada is very passionate, isn't it. I'm sure we're not getting any rest today because of the final adjustments. Excuse me. Harada-san! Thank you for your hard work. Harada-senpai, what brings you here? Oh, I had a little business. Well, congratulations on your bronze medal. Thank you. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I'm counting on you for the team competition tomorrow. Come on, we'll support you. Sorry, Nishikata. Can I borrow your undershirt? Hello? Nishikata Excuse me, can I borrow your undershirt? What? I think I forgot. I didn't bring enough. What do you mean, you forgot? It's the Olympics for goodness sake. Sorry, sorry. Tomorrow, with the help of your team, I'll definitely get the gold medal. Well, at least bring your own undershirts. Thank you. I saw how hard you worked on the test jumps. It really felt like your team and ours were jumping together. What is this? I wanted to try to understand what you're feeling. What do you know? What do you know about me? I don't want to be a test jumper or whatever. Even now, that's what I really think. You don't know how I feel, do you? I didn't make the team because I'm not good enough. I know that much is true. It's no one's fault but my own. But... I haven't forgiven you yet. If you hadn't made a mistake. I would have gotten the gold medal. Nishikata I also feel ashamed of myself. But I... don't want to see your gold medal at all. Even so, I... still have to get the gold medal! The gold medal! The highlight of the Nagano Olympics. The ski jumping team competition is about to start. Will we be able to make a clean break in Nagano? To witness the moment when the Hinomaru team wins the gold medal. Forty-five thousand spectators are on their way to the venue. The day of the ski jumping team competition Test jumps are over The competition is about to begin. Hey, Nishikata! Yukie! Shingo refused to listen, he had to come and watch. I see. I've decided to retire. Yeah... I wish I hadn't become a test jumper. I guess I should listen to my wife. Nishikata, jump! I'm sorry, Shingo. Dad won't jump this time. Okay, I'm going. Okabe Takanobu - First jump Good jump! Good jump! Good jump! He's landed! Okabe has successfully jumped a good distance beyond the k-point. Yeah! Saito Hiroya - First jump Good! Keep going! Keep going! Landed! Saito made it! Good job. Great jump over the k-point. Nice big jump! You've given us hope, Saito. 130 meter event, Japan is in first place. (I can already see them receiving their medals) My Olympic career is over. No, it's not. My entire career is over. It was over four years ago. (The weather is pretty bad today) Harada, although the weather is bad, it's almost time to get ready. Harada-san, we're counting on you. (Next up is Volkov, Russia) (The wind is very strong) (He landed too quickly and couldn't make the distance) (When he landed, he staggered back and forth into a slide) Okay. Nagano Olympics Ski Jumping The final event, the team competition. Japan is now in first place after two jumpers The Japanese athletes have shown their world class ability on the Olympics stage. For who's sake am I still being here? Hinomaru is flying high. So, Japan's ace competitor Harada Masahiko is on the stage Here he is at last! A huge cheer. Everyone is eagerly anticipating Harada is coming on now! Why am I here? While you're on that stage, Harada. Harada Masahiko, Japan Oh, the snow is really coming down hard. The situation doesn't look good, does it? For Harada, the weather is probably his worst enemy. Harada's visibility is severely limited, isn't it? To jump in such difficult conditions. (In such a situation) (What well can Harada jump?) (Japan's strongest ski jumping team ever!) Fall down Harada! You've got this. Go! Go! Go! He fell! Harada, he fell down! He fell short! Before the 90 meter line. He stalled early and fell. I didn't expect that of Harada. Lillehammer's nightmare is repeating itself. Harada, what are you doing? No one wants to see the same scenario again. So the distance is 79.5 meters The distance was not reached. Japan's ranking has fallen He fell too early Was it too hasty? Harada failed to extend the flight distance He slumped his shoulders in disappointment Nishikata-san It's not good. If we don't regroup The Japanese team is in a dilemma. The fourth team... -Harada! - 4th place They've already lost. Harada, why didn't you jump properly? The competition has been temporarily suspended due to bad weather. The competition is temporarily suspended. It's over? They're saying it's suspended Let's go find a warmer place and wait for Dad. Okay The game is being interrupted The judges are deliberating. Please wait a moment. I didn't expect the game to be stopped. (The committee and the judges will meet to discuss) It's normal to stop the game when it's snowing so hard. (The judging panel is composed of members from Japan, Norway, Germany, Australia and other countries.) The result of the competition will be determined by the results of the first jump. In this case (According to the results of the first jump, first Australia, second Germany) Japan won't get a medal? (Third, Norway, and fourth, Japan.) I'm afraid that if the competition continues in this condition At this rate Harada-senpai will be treated as the villain again. That's terrible! How can he do well in such heavy snow? He's the reason why we're able to jump. The world doesn't care about that. (But in this situation, to adjust the starting point...) Earlier, downstairs, I met Harada. He was saying "Sorry!" He was smiling as usual. He's really unlucky. For four years, from Lillehammer to now. He's been treated like a villain. He's being picked on. It's not uncommon to get threatening phone calls. He told me about it. I asked him how you could survive the hard training in such a situation. Guess what he said? He said if he hadn't failed, Okabe, Kasai, Nishikata. Everyone would have won the gold medal. It was he who changed everyone's life. So, he was the only one who couldn't give up easily. With such determination to win, he returned to the Olympic Games. But that idiot he made another mistake. Chief Muroya! The decision of the judging committee has been made. Can we restart the competition? The decision will be made by the jumps of the 25 test jumpers. If one of them fails, the judging committee will decide that the track is dangerous, and the competition will be suspended. No way! In order to restart the competition, the entire 25-member team must successfully complete the jump in this weather Successfully complete the jump. And... it is not enough to complete the jump, You must also clear away the snow that blocks the slide Prove that you can jump a good flying distance That's not possible. It's too dangerous. In a snowstorm like this, even the national team can't do anything about it. We're not guinea pigs. I understand that. But even so, I am here to beg of you, we can't let the team competition stop here. This Nagano Olympics, winning the gold medal, is the dream of Japan ski jumping. Please! Are you asking us to jump with the Hinomaru on our backs? I refuse, Chief Muroya. As Nishikata said, it's too dangerous. I cannot give the order for them to jump. I did say that you should jump for the future. But not be victims for the sake of a medal. If someone gets hurt by jumping here. It would be a great loss to the Japanese ski jumping world. You are not just a random selection of test jumpers. I firmly believe that all of you here... all of you are the future of the Japanese ski jumping. Kanzaki-san Nishikata Why do you think I chose you to be a test jumper? You didn't really think I picked you because you were free, did you? I see. Kanzaki, you're right. I understand. I'll tell the judging committee what you said. Please wait a moment. So what will the Winter Olympics be like? Is this the end? I don't want it to end like this. I'll do it. - Please let me jump. - No. You can't put your life in danger for a medal. It's not for a medal or for Hinomaru. I want to jump for myself. You don't understand. You don't understand how dangerous it is to jump in this bad weather. - Of course I know that. - Calm down. I understand how you feel, but... The Olympic Games is my dream. Because I'm a girl. I may never have the chance to be on the Olympic stage again. So I... I don't want the Olympics to end in the middle like this. Nishikata-san, are you really willing to give up like this? Do you really want the Olympics to end in this way? I absolutely do not want it. I... I also want to jump. Takahashi. Think about it, it's all depending on us now, winning the gold medal. We're going to jump for a medal at the Olympics. There will never be such an opportunity again If I don't jump this time I will ... I will regret it for the rest of my life. Please. Please let me jump. Please let me jump. Me too, please. Me too, please. We'll make it, please. Please. I only have one condition. If you think it's dangerous, you must quit immediately. You must put your own safety first, understood? Understood! Shingo. Let's go home. We'll wait for Dad at home Nishikata Huh? What are you saying all of a sudden? I heard that whether the competition can be restarted is determined by the jumps of the test jumpers. I understand. We're about to start the test jumps. Japan's gold medal depends on Nishikata's team. How do we decide the jumps? The first jump is the most difficult, because the track is in the most snowy state. That's right. I will jump first. Of course the most difficult should be given to the best skier. But Minamikawa, you... I'd like to do a favor for the league. Who I need to jump for, I now understand what you said. You can do it. Now I know I can make it. Nishikata-san Go! I'm off! Alright! Amazing! Oh yeah! I did it! Go! I'm off! Go! In the first half of the course, it's better not to have gaps, so we jump one after the other. If we delay, snow will accumulate on the track again. But Do not panic. If one person fails. It's the end. What are you afraid of? We have only one way to go. Soul and passion! Hinomaru soul. I mean, maybe... all of us here, maybe it's the Hinomaru Soul. Hinomaru Soul, are we going to do it? Yes!! - Lets go! - Okay. Eh? Why are they jumping again? I thought they were going to stop the race. Nice jump! Great jump! Good job. I don't think the wind is going to stop. Check the situation. - It's freezing. - When's the race starting again? Dad might be jumping. Okay. The judging committee has informed me that they want to confirm the state of the track. As such, they are raising the starting position. We're going to change the starting point. - They're raising it? - Looks like it's being raised. That's impossible. It's going to be a lot more difficult with the increased height. If you quit now, no one will blame you. I'm fine with it. Because... I'm your apprentice. That's crazy. It's too hard. It'll be fine. I trust her. Yoshiko. Yoshiko! Hinomaru Soul Go! Kobayashi, move the upper part of your body forward in one breath. Great! That was awesome! Yoshiko Yoshiko! I'm so glad. Thank goodness. Yoshiko Keep going. Yes! Thank goodness. Next. In the second half of the sliding speed will also increase. Those jumping in the back should watch their jump distance. How can you see the distance in a snowstorm like this? Leave it to me. My personal best distance was 134 meters. Hinomaru Soul Hinomaru Soul Takahashi Takahashi... Takahashi Goggles on It was good, the whiskey. Just slide as usual. Enjoy yourself. Go! Let's go! Yes! I heard it! Nishikata! I heard it! The last jump, only Nishikata can do it. Nishikata, please! Nishikata-san's last jump! Please show them a big jump that will convince the judges You're the only one who can do it. We will clear the way for you, Nishikata-san. Nishikata! Come on, let's get started. Let's go back. It's not starting anyway. It's over. Let's go home. Shingo! Daddy's going to jump! How long is the test jump going to last? Let's go home. I can't take it anymore. You're the one who drank my whiskey, right? You're bringing this up now? I will forgive you if you exceed the K-point. And the judging committee won't have a problem. Kanzaki-san. I... I wanted him to fall. When Harada was jumping. I was hoping he would fall. I'm the worst. We were teammates who fought together. A person like me would never be chosen to represent an athlete. I didn't make it to the Olympics either. The feeling of not being selected, I understand it more than you know. I... I really didn't know what I was doing here. All I've been thinking about was why I'm a test jumper. Or giving up ski jumping altogether. I've been depressed. But I really can't hate ski jumping, after all. I'll... help Harada win the gold medal. Go! The first time I jumped was when I was 10 years old, my legs were weak because of fear. But the moment I jumped off, the view from up there was so beautiful. It made me feel like I could reach anywhere I can still jump Nishikata Jump! Yes! Alright! Great! The competition is about to resume. The competition is about to resume. Next... Next... It's their turn. I didn't expect it to be the same as the Lillehammer Winter Olympics four years ago. Once again, Japan's gold medal is entrusted to this man. Next is the second jump by Harada Masahiko. You didn't go back? That guy is an idiot. There, he's trying to make us feel we're jumping together. He's wearing my gloves. He said he forgot to bring them. Tell the truth next time, you idiot! Will Harada be able to regain his position? This time, we're going for the gold medal. Harada! Jump! What will happen this time? It's a high jump! It's high! It's high! He's still flying! He's still flying! Very high, very high, very high, very high. Higher, higher, higher, higher! He did it! Harada has successfully completed a huge jump. Harada did an amzaing jump. Harada performed a perfect jump at the end. A beautiful jump in such a snowstorm The distance was 137 meters, far beyond the K-point. His jump* has shocked the world! (*His jump matched the olympic record at that time) A big jump that will go down in history. Finally! Harada! He has finally gained redemption for the Lillehammer Winter Olympics. Funaki is jumping too. Still going, still going, still going, still going, landed! Funaki has shown his strength on the last jump. Japan has won the gold medal. Japan has won the gold medal! Japan has finally won the gold medal it has always wanted. This time, your jump has made a beautiful comeback. It was so hard! The thought that I might hold everyone back again, it was so painful. I didn't do it alone, we did it together, together. Stop crying Harada, you idiot! He can't stop after all. Oh, I can't! Jinya! Thank you for your hard work. This is the most exhausting jump I've ever done in my life. But... I also saw the most beautiful scenery in my ski jumping career. Yukie, uhm... I don't want to give up, after all. What? Jumping I'm thinking of sticking with it for a while. Well.... it can't be helped. You really like ski jumping, don't you? Shingo, was dad's jump good? Nishikata. Here, I'll give you the gold medal. Congratulations. Your gold medal... Jinya. Shingo! Don't call me by my last name. Call me Dad. Dad! Wow, that's amazing. Nishikata Jinya continued to be a top-level competitor for the next three years. 16 years after the Nagano Olympics, the women's ski jump became an official event at the Sochi Olympics. (Side note: Yoshiko did not participate) Dedicated to the heroes behind the scenes.
