Sanal Kumar. Sangeeth. O.V. Arun. V.R. Ashwin Kumar. Ajith. O.V. Bipin. J. Christy. Don. Manoj Kumar. Manoj, where were you? Get inside. Priyadarshan. Where is Priyadarshan? Priyadarshan! -Actor Mammootty in a military role after "Nair Saab"... ... joins director Priyadarshan for a new movie. Playing in Chalakkudy Akkara theatre from tomorrow onwards. "Megham" [The cloud] Col. Ravi Varma Thampuran, who arrives in a village in Kerala... ...to spend a two-month vacation, from the military. And several interesting characters in the village, awaiting his arrival. Hey Priyan! Yes, Gopaletta. Aren't you going for the excursion today? I thought I will leave after your notice vehicle arrives. You sit here flying these notices. Your school bus has reached near the bridge. - Oh no! - Yeah! "Megham" From today onwards. If it has reached the bridge, I can go via Raghavettan's house, run through the banana plantation... and catch up! Oops! You dropped it. Can you get us the ball? Sister, water please. "Priyan Ottathilaanu" [Priyan is on the run] Just like last year, for this year's Annual celebrations of the library, we will conduct a theatre camp for children. We will ask Radhakrishnan Sir to write a story. Once he finishes the story, we can conduct a rehearsal camp for the children. Hey! Hello! Sir! A children's play should be written by children, right? How can it be a children's play if grown-ups write it? Chekkutta, the thing is... ...we need children who have story-writing skills, right? Radhakrishnan Sir writes the play every year. Bro, has this week's film magazine arrived? The film magazine... Yeah! Here you go! He keeps writing some stuff, right? What if I suggest his name? This year's play... Why don't we make Priyan write it? What have you done, Kuttetta? Have I ever written plays so far? Hey! This is how you learn to do it. I didn't suggest your name just because you are my uncle's son. I did so, because I feel you have a flair for writing. [Story - Priyadarshan] Hey! She is running away. Catch her! Come on! - Help! - Stop! Catch her! - Come. - Stop! Come fast! Catch her! - She is going the other way. - Catch her! Hey! Cut! Cut! I think that lady smiled. - Hey! Call her. - Okay Sir. - Ask her not to smile. - Artists! Artists, back to position. Isn't this flat going to be demolished? The shooting is happening over there. Did you ask? Did they say anything? Where is the caretaker? - The security guard is missing. - Hey! Isn't anyone here? Hey! Cut! Cut! Who is that in the frame? Move him aside. Chetta, please move aside. You are in the field. - What field? - There is a camera over there. What nonsense is this? Can't we live here peacefully? - Let's come here after a while. - This is not right! - Please co-operate. - No. This won't be allowed here. -Okay, sir! Ready for take! - What nonsense is this? Okay! Take! Back to position! - It would be better if the artist comes down quickly. - Lady artist, try not to smile. - Get lost! - What? - What did you say? - I was on a call. - Who are you? - Who are you? I'm the production controller. Production controller? Do you know that this flat has an issue? Issue? What issue? This flat is going to be demolished as the drainage from here... ... is flowing to our homes. There is a stay order from the court. To be demolished? This building? My dear bro, this producer's life is already demolished when his last two films flopped. - Please cooperate. - That won't happen. - Do you want this 3rd film to flop? - No! No! We can't step outside because of your parked vehicles. I'll take care of it. - When will you take care of it? - Just give me two minutes. Just two minutes. I'll take care of it. Believe me. - Sir will take care of it. - Tell them to stop the shoot. - What are you shooting here? - Tell him to take care of this first. Hey! A film shoot is going on here. Priyan Sir has told me to check whether they're creating any damage. I'll take care of that. If you haven't eaten, they're serving food over there. That's fine. I'll go and have it. - Hello Sir. - I can't reach Priyadarshan. - Is that so? I'll try him. - Do it fast. Okay! Varkey Chetta! I've told you many times... ...not to put food and plastic waste together. If this goes on, we won't collect waste from here. I'm warning you. Calm down, my dear Vanitha. I'm calling Priyan Sir now. Hello? Prince came a while ago and took him along. Is that so? He hasn't taken his phone. Okay. Okay! Ready! Take! Shot No: 12. Note it down correctly. Okay? Niju, keep this somewhere else. Please. Don't make too much noise. - People have started complaining - No! No! Okay ready! Please ask them to clear the field. Where were you all this while? Where is Priyan Sir? Oh Dad! Don't ask! - On the way, he went to 7B... - To 7B? He has gone to repair a gas connection. He said he will be back soon. Sigh! This man! - Did it light up? - No. - Now? - No. - Is it beef? - No, it's Sambar. Try once again. No, it's not working. Aunty, haven't you turned the knob on? Oops! I forgot about it. That didn't strike my mind. Yes, it's working now. Praise the Lord! I hope the Sambar turns out to be good. Anyway, good that it's working. Don't wait till the cylinder gets empty. Inform me beforehand. - I'll do that. - Okay. - Come as soon as I call you. - Okay. Thank you. Okay.. Okay. I wonder how it is. I hope salt and pepper are adequate. - Sir, wait a minute. - What is it? We had asked the residents multiple times not to put food and plastic waste together. - I'll take care of it. - We can't do this any more. This time, we are very serious! Bro, please repair the fuse in 3B before you leave. Mr.Priyan, what is this message that you have sent? This is to inform you that you should pay the due amount of Rs. 500. - What is this? - What's the problem? I'm not a tenant. I'm the owner of a flat here. Is this how you should talk to me? Like an order? "You should pay" implies "Can you please pay?" It's a request. - You should ask politely like that. - You're right. That's exactly my point! Hey Priyan! Being the president, you should find a solution for this. - We can't walk around here. - I can't take my vehicle I was taking online music classes for my students. It got disconnected. What a nuisance! Hey Shobha! What's it, Sir? Can you supervise the segregation of food and plastic waste from tomorrow onwards? - We will pay you Rs.100. - I can do it, Sir. - Rs. 100? That's not right. - Why so? Sir, that's what I'm saying. This flat association doesn't have any funds. Also, we don't have any money. These painting and maintenance works have to be done with the money they pay us. - We need to get things done, right? - Then it's okay. That's what I said! I've spoken to the secretary. He will solve it. - Look, here he is! - What's the problem? Tell him the problem. We can't go anywhere because of these parked vehicles. Shouldn't we go outside? And the folks who went out, shouldn't they come back? We can't even walk! Look! Just a minute. - Give me Rs. 2,000. - Rs. 2,000? I don't think they will find a solution. Here's 2000 Rupees. Check if it's more than that. - That's not required. - No way! This won't work. Rs. 5,000 is the daily rent we've calculated for the road. You will get the rest of the money after today's shoot. - These guys will pay you. - Yes. - So it's Rs. 5,000 per day? - Yes, Rs. 5,000. Don't argue now. Let's agree. It's not like we need the money. Okay. Fine. Will they finish the shoot today? - We must finish it today, somehow. - That's not possible. Take your time! - Priyan! - What's it? Those kids have nominated me for the flat association's dance programme. -I'm really scared. -No need to be scared. It's just our people in the audience. It won't be a problem. Come. There won't be any problem. Come. - I don't know what I should do. -Priyan! Tell me. Priyan, can we get flat no. 1B for the shoot? The lady in 1B is in a serious condition. I'm even more serious. I'll bring it there. You may leave. I'm very serious. - Are you pregnant? - No! There is a pregnant lady in that flat. That's the problem. Can you solve it by moving the lady to 2B? - Varkey! - Yes. - Varkey! - Coming! Hey! Can you make arrangements for them to shoot in flat no. 1B? You can move 1B's occupants to 2B and give 1B to him. - Understood? - Iâ€™ll check with them. These guys will give some money. Take that and make a settlement. - Then I'll check it, Sir. - Okay. - He will arrange it. - Come, Sir. - Come fast. Sir! - I'll settle the waste issue. It's not that. Please get her a chance to act in this movie, sir. - What? - Since the shoot is happening here... They will do it if you tell them. - Sir! - Don't let them come upstairs! Oh, you are back? Spit! Spit it out. Can you eat hot food, at least today? This is fine. I had warned you when you took up the secretary's post. What to do? It's on my head now. Don't make me say how it fell upon your head! Have a bath and put on your clothes. Mom, you should bathe me today. Don't be cranky. Go and take bath. I don't have time. Mom should bathe me today. Mom should bathe me today. Hey! Come here. What is it? You want to be bathed? I will give you a bath. Did you brush your teeth? Show me. Good. Did you cut your nails? Did you practice your dance? Show me some steps. There is no time for your dance. Go and take bath. Isn't she a small kid? One... Two... Three.. One... Two.. Three... Go and change your dress quickly. Dad will give you a bath. Dad will give me a bath today! How's her studies going? Studies? They send everything home. Yeah! The competition is between parents! By the way, you are also a parent. Haven't you taken bath yet? I'll take bath after Dad comes. He will bathe me. Speed up everything. We need to shift soon. I'll be late for office even today. Can't even find a file for the child here. All we have are some useless movie scripts. It would have been good if these were useful in any way. My day will come! Yeah, sure! Get the child ready now! - â™ª It's only for Priyan â™ª - Move aside. â™ª My sweet love â™ª Dad, can I ask you a question? It's from the movie I saw yesterday. That's my girl! Ask me. What does "virgin" mean? - What? - What does "virgin" mean? Doing everything... Doing everything with the permission of your parents... ...until you grow up is called "virgin". Got it? Good that he has an answer for everything! - Hello. - Yes, Chechi. - Keerthy, where are you? - I'm in my apartment. - Will Sreejith be there today? Yes, Sreejith is working from home today. We thought we will drop by your flat today evening. Oh, okay. We will be here. Okay then. See you in the evening. Okay, Chechi. We haven't visited them after they shifted to the new apartment. Yes, we haven't. You are right. So I told her that we'll be visiting today. Let's do this. Let's visit them today. For God's sake, please don't take up any errands today. Why are you saying that? She is my sister too. - Let's definitely go today. - We shouldn't go empty-handed. - We should buy something for them. - Yes. Listen. I'll leave the clinic by 2:30 PM. I have to get some medicines from Panampilly Nagar. After that, I'll pick up our daughter. Then, I'll pick you up and we will go to Lulu mall for shopping. Then, we'll head to their apartment and have dinner from there. Okay? Isn't it a decent schedule? Yes, it is. But don't ruin it like you do all the time. Why are you smiling then? You always say this. That's why. You just wait and see. - It will all go well this time. - Okay. My sister and husband are coming here. Shouldn't we give them something to eat? Yeah. Hey. If you're planning to get your sister to recommend you for a job, don't do it! Understood? I don't need anyone's recommendation. My sister is coming to see me. I know how to get a job on my own. - Okay, then. - Okay. - Hi, Rehana. - Hi. - Mom. - Hello, Priyan! You should come here urgently. What's the matter? Uncle Mani wants to meet you. When ailing people repeatedly ask the same thing, what can I say? The three of us will come there, tomorrow or the day after. Don't wait for that. Just get here quickly. - Neena. - Yes. - I have to tell you something. - Carry on. I'll join you. Hey! Uncle Mani is really ill. So, if I get the stock from Panampilly... ... and then go to Chalakkudy to meet Uncle Mani and come back, I won't be able to pick up our daughter, right? No, you can't. You pick her up today. I knew this would happen when you said that it's a decent schedule. Maniyan! Maniyan! Look who's here! Uncle! Son... You have succeeded in life. Uncle is very happy now. Chekkuttan... You should... ...care... ... take care... Maniyan! Maniyan! Indira! - Hello. - I'm here. - What is it, Bro? - Listen. - You get someone to set up a tent here. - I'll arrange that. Shouldn't we inform Chekkuttan? Yeah. Where is he now? Chetta, this one too. Okay then. Shall we go? Move aside and play, kids. Aunty, we are leaving. It's really late. It's already dusk. Why don't you leave tomorrow? We have to drop that kid home. Minu, come here. See you later then. I forgot to ask you. Who is this kid? He is the son of the caretaker in our apartment. - What is your name? - Prince. Mom says that he is Dad's secretary. Go and sit inside the car. - Total is Rs. 4,000 including the tent. - Rs. 4,000? Have you increased the rates? Aunty... - Two chairs broke. That's why. - Hey! I will come after two days. Call me if you need anything. In this house, this is the first time that my Dad is dying. So I don't know much about all this now. I won't let you trick me when the next death happens. Right, Mom? Uncle? Give the bill to me. Priyan, we're able to manage now, since I have a job. What will happen to him when I retire? - Let me see. Please get him a job, which he wouldn't quit so easily. I'll take care of Chekkuttan. Okay? - Okay dear. - I will handle him. I'll settle the bill. Let me know if there's anything. He is my younger brother. He will pay. He's a doctor. Get it from him. - Hello? - Priyan, it's me. Production controller Raghu. Will you be at the clinic tomorrow? Yes, I'll be there. I'll send a guy there tomorrow. He is an aspiring director. Can you please give him a couple of your stories to read? Sure. Shall I send him to the clinic in the morning? Okay! But which story should I give him? I have liked all of your stories. Anyway, you guys talk to each other. Okay. - Okay. - Okay, thank you. Doctor. My name is Jomon. Production controller Raghu has sent me. Ah, yes. Give me a minute. Yes, tell me. I have a plan to direct a movie. Raghu said that you had a few scripts with you, Doctor. What kind of movie do you want to make? I don't have anything specific in mind. I'm interested in family, feel-good kind of stories. Which was the last movie that you watched and liked? Movies that I liked... Quite a few are there. Off the top of my head, it would be "Lunchbox" starring Irrfan Khan. I haven't seen it. I don't watch too many Hindi movies. This one is a thriller. We have plenty of such movies right now. This one is female-centric. There are too many of them too. I think this one will work for you. "Evergreen David" Story, Screenplay, Dialogue - Priyadarshan K "Evergreen David" - Nice title. - Thank you. I wrote this two years back. I'll return it after going through it real quick. No, no. You can read it at your own pace. - Okay, then. - Okay. You haven't left yet? Priyetta... I skimmed through it, real quick. What do I say? It's really good. - I'm sure I can turn this into a project. - Okay. I have only one request. Please don't give this script to anyone else. No, not at all. You can do it. - Are you sure? - Yes, I'm sure. Thank you, Priyetta. â™ª It's true There's truthfulness in the heart â™ª â™ª There are a hundred things to achieve truthfully â™ª â™ª Your find it difficult to share what's in your heart to the person before you â™ª â™ª You cannot say no to anything or anyone â™ª â™ª Through your words or glances â™ª â™ª Before knowing what it is or how it can be done â™ª â™ª You have promised many things, without considering who it is for â™ª â™ª You have to fulfil your promises â™ª â™ª Once you fulfil it, you have to run â™ª â™ª You need to run to achieve everything â™ª â™ª You are there for everyone, every day â™ª â™ª Yet, everyone is following you around to get things done â™ª â™ª You never consider anything as difficult for yourself â™ª â™ª It's true It's true â™ª â™ª It's true There's truthfulness in the heart â™ª â™ª There are a hundred things to achieve truthfully â™ª â™ª Your find it difficult to share what's in your heart to the person before you â™ª â™ª You cannot say no to anything or anyone â™ª â™ª Through your words or glances â™ª Even the notice from the municipality hasn't shaken you guys. - Notice? - Yes, notice! Don't you know what it is? What is it, Sobha? The colony residents are creating a ruckus downstairs. Rajeevan Sir called the police when they started threatening. - Please come downstairs. - Police? You have 7 days as per the notice. We will lock your drainage system after that. Dear Shameer, there's a law to follow... What law? You are outsiders here. Your flat and this road was built on our land. We know how to get this done. - Do you want to see? - No, I don't. Whatever the problem is, we can solve it. What problem? This problem will be solved only when all of you vacate from here. - We've bought these flats by taking loans. - What loans? We bought it because the documents from the village council and municipality were proper. You should have checked those properly before buying. We won't allow waste water to flow outside at any cost. We will block that drainage. Those who don't want to die amidst the waste, can leave. Let them die. All of you will die amidst the waste. Bro, what can we do if you come and say this suddenly? - Let's discuss and settle it. - What's there to discuss? Nothing doing! Leave this place now itself. What will you do if we don't leave? - You won't leave? - Take your hands off me! Let's drive these people away. That's the only way. [inaudible arguments] What's going on here? See for yourself, sir. There's a foul smell due to all that waste water. Who will solve this? Please tell us, sir. Sir, we won't allow the waste water from this flat to flow outside. Who is the office bearer for this flat's association? Sir, it's me. Do one thing. Discuss with the Councillor and the natives and... ...arrive at a solution. Understood? Don't trouble us. All of you may leave. They will discuss and arrive at a solution. - Don't create problems here. - Sir, these guys won't listen to anyone. Sir, we won't create any problems. Hey! We have to set up a meeting quickly! Okay. That won't be starting any time soon. Joji has agreed to give us 10 days. Okay. I'll call you later. I have a meeting now. - Bro, Priyettan is here. - Okay. I'll call you. Come Priyan. This is where our producer is. - Are we here to meet the producer? - You bet! For a producer, we might have to travel through paths unexplored! We could have avoided this path with broken glass bottles. What else would you find in a scrap bottle factory? I didn't bring the script. Script? Who needs the script? He won't understand it anyway. Don't worry. Ours is a family subject. It won't suit this set-up. Priyan, he won't understand it even if it's a family or a comedy subject. Mammootty should be the hero. That's all he wants. Won't the budget shoot up, if it's Mammootty? Yes. Of course. But... what you see all around, is money! All these? This moneybag... can easily finance a Mammootty movie. He has enough and more money to splurge. We will crack open this Bottle Rajan! Hey Assami! How many bottles have you broken now? That's our man. 'Bottle' Rajan. Now you broke another one. Do you know the cost of a bottle? 2 Rupees! 2 + 2 = 4 I'll cut Rs. 4 from your salary. What is this, sir? Don't talk back. You won't get those 4 Rupees. That's all. It was such a beautiful bottle. - Rajetta! - What? - Oh! It's you? - Come. Don't step on the bottles. - Come. - Rajetta! Priyan, Jomon.. Come! Kamal Haasan, bring three or four chairs. That's not required. - Then? - We will sit here. - Sit. - Don't bring the chairs then. This is our director, Jomon. This is the writer, Priyan. - Hello. - He is also a Homeo Doctor. Homeo or Home-cure doesn't matter. Mammootty should be the hero. Didn't I say so? Why do you want to make a movie with Mammootty? That's a long story. Back when I used to pick up beer bottles from the street to sell them, I came to know that Mammootty is shooting in Mattancherry. I went to see Mammootty along with my friend. He had a camera. An old, small camera. We went there, to click a photo with Mammootty. We asked Mammootty whether we can click a photo with him. Mammootty put his hand over my shoulder and said, go ahead. My friend quickly clicked five or six photos. That's great. But I realised my mistake only on my way back. What happened? My friend had forgotten to load film inside the camera! Where was the film? In his pocket! Isn't it a costly affair to make a film with Mammootty... ... just to get a photo with him? Priyan! That's our Rajettan! Though he's a millionaire, he's not at all arrogant about it. It's true that I do have millions with me. - Understand? - We know that. People call me "Bottle" Rajan all the time. I want to change that... ...and make people call me "Producer" Rajan! We will make them do that! But don't get me in trouble. Okay? Chetta, shall we narrate the story? What for? Mammootty should be the hero. Also, don't forget to load the film inside the camera! They will do that. Don't get into movies and lose your money. Try to live with what you have. Mom, I will be paid to write the script. That's lacking here now. Hey Priyan! The plantain tree is fine now, thanks to your homeo medicines. It was really effective. How is your leg, Dad? What do I say? I had sent your Mom to buy some herbal oil. And where did she end up? At the bar nearby. Now, our neighbour Raghavan Nair is asking... ... whether I send your Mom to buy me alcohol. As if he hasn't done anything foolish in his life. She might have hurried in there, thinking of something else. You've got the same hasty character of hers. You could have brought Neena and your daughter along. She is allergic to the smell of cows and the straw. - Allergy? - Why? Didn't she grow up drinking cow's milk? They think they are too modern! Hey! I had a hard time convincing him to come to your apartment, as you told me. He'll take this as an excuse, not to come there. If it floods here during the next monsoon, we will have to shift to your place permanently. When can you come there? The astrologer told us that the 13th is the best day to visit your flat. 13th? What's wrong with the 13th? It's all right. I'll come and pick you up in the morning. - Hey! - Yes, Dad. - Open the boot of your car. - Okay. What is this? A supermarket? No, Dad. Some urgent supplies. These are pesticide-free bananas. Give it to your kid. Mom, please take this tea cup. - You didn't drink it. - That's enough. - Bye. - Where is Chekkuttan? - He is in the city. - Is he doing well after you got him a job? Will anyone in their right mind take care of him like you do? Didn't Uncle Mani ask us to take care of Kuttettan, on his death bed? He didn't say, "Take care". He said, "Be careful!". Now that he got a job, he has a sense of responsibility. He has changed for the good. Will you break it? - Open it. - Who? Me? - Only if you want petrol. Is he going home, after leaving me to work here? Every job has its own working hours. I want to know the exact working hours of my job. - What? - Working time. These flexible timings won't work. Hello! That's how it is, here! That's why you've been given accommodation and all these facilities. Understood? Yeah, right! Facilities! I can't live my life, suffocating inside this cramped up space. Oh! I didn't invite Your Majesty to work for me! Dr. Priyan happened to be a friend of mine. You can quit if you don't like it here. Understood? I have already decided what to do. One more thing... Don't think that you can exploit your employees forever! Shut your mouth and get lost! - What? - Get lost! The employer is asking the employee to get lost? Say it once again if you dare! Get out of here! We haven't charged a case. We called you to find out what the actual issue is. Initially, we thought that he was a terrorist. Upon further questioning, he said that he is your brother. He is my cousin. Mentally unstable people should be kept at home. You should not allow them to roam outside... ... creating problems for people and the police. Who is mentally unstable, sir? What problem did I create? You must tell me, sir. Do one thing, sir. Register a case against me. I'll fight it in court. I want to know whether this is country is still a democracy. That's all. See? This is it. This is the only problem. Just a minute. - Bro, come with me. - Ask them to arrest me. - I will fight the case in court. - Please stay here. Sir, I will make sure that this won't happen again. I'll let him go now on your surety. Give us your address and other details... ...and get going with this item! Hey! Priyan Sir has arrived. Come with me. Bring that too. Hey! I am starving! - Can I get Kuzhimandi? - For breakfast? What's wrong with that? Sir! Sir! I had asked you something. - What? - I mean... about her? What about her? She really wants to act in movies. So? We heard that you are writing a story for a movie? - Who told you that? - Prince. Sir, any role would do. Hand these over to that fatso. - Please hold it, Bro. - Show the videos on your phone to Sir. - What is that? - Weren't you writing for plays? - For movies. - Movies? But... ... when Nadira mocked me, listing the fortunes she received, it drove me mad! That made me turn into this cruel person! Ya Allah! - How is it? Isn't it good? - Yeah! - She does this all the time. - Is that so? Very nice. - Sir, please give her a chance. - I'll try. Please don't forget. What for? She can't emote to save her life! Try some other job, girl! - Lip syncing for someone else's lines. - Who is this? He is my relative. Come, bro. I'll get you Kuzhimandi. Don't listen to him. Go, deliver this milk. Why did she hand over the milk to me? She must have mistaken you for a milkman! Bro, you can freshen up. Who is this bearded man? Is he a villain from KGF? No, he is Neena's spiritual Guru. You guys worship God-men even today? In which century are you living? You go and take bath. I'll make her understand. What's wrong with this new generation? - Hey! - What is this? He will be here for two days. Shift the kid to our bedroom. I expected this when you left. I've already shifted her. Very good. Good wife! What's your plan? Well, as the kid is in our room now, we can't make any plans, right? Not that! What are you planning to do about him? He will be with us until he gets a new job. New job? So, he lost the old one? Yes! Wonder how long he'd be here! Hey! How can I say no when aunt asks me to support him? Try to understand. - He doesn't mend... - Lower your voice. He doesn't mend his ways because there is someone to support him. It won't end well if you continue this. Please don't say so! Hey! Don't go. Didn't you apply shampoo? - Yes, I did. - Good. Why don't you colour your hair? That's trending now. I did it last week. Oh! Let me see. Do you have herbal shampoo? - Herbal shampoo. - Herbal? Do we have herbal shampoo? No, we don't have it. What about oil? Oil.. We have the extracted one. Powdered green gram? Powdered... No. We don't have green gram. What about herbal powder? Bro, why don't you give me a list? Hey! Gone! â™ª Running forward and backward, not knowing the destination â™ª â™ª Issues keep piling up, one by one â™ª â™ª Running forward and backward, not knowing the destination â™ª â™ª Issues keep piling up, one by one â™ª Shucks! Sorry! Sorry! Sreejith, didn't you do this deliberately? - Of course not. - I am not a fool. What happened to your voice? It's nothing. Keerthy, are you crying? Priyetta, Keerthy is crying. - Hello Keerthy. - I was planning to meet you. - Just a minute. - My jaw still hurts from that slap. I didn't file a case just because it's you. He's a friend of mine. Hello, Keerthy? The call got disconnected. Is this pure milk? Yes, straight from our home. It must be having some issue. - Wait, let me taste it. - Oh no! Oh no, he spilt it. We've been waiting for the lift, for half an hour now. - What's the problem? - This guy is a real nuisance. Sorry. See you! Priyetta, please come. - This is our writer. - Hi. One minute. Neena? The wardrobe key is with me. Play it. Chetta, I will come. No. I was held up with many other errands. I'm stressed about all that. In the beginning, there is a "Clinjo-Plinjo" sound, right? - "Clinjo-Plinjo"? - Yes, at the very beginning. You mean to change the western style to folk? Yes, you are right. He didn't get it. Is it possible to replace it with native instruments? - Won't it work? - That can be done. - It's really nice. - I will call you. He is not a typical film industry guy. That's why. â™ª Moments that became memories, have adorned new colours â™ª â™ª The good days you've always dreamt of, will blossom all over this path â™ª â™ª Why do you keep retreating, as you move forward? â™ª â™ª Before one issue is solved, another one springs up â™ª â™ª Why does every unwanted trouble end up with you? â™ª â™ª Even if this vehicle is in good condition, it is facing a tough time â™ª â™ª Your rotten luck never leaves you â™ª â™ª Running forward and backward, not knowing the destination â™ª â™ª Issues keep piling up, one by one â™ª â™ª The story is changing slowly and regularly, unbeknown to you â™ª â™ª You keep drifting away, unknowingly â™ª â™ª While taking public roads, short-cuts, by-lanes and what not, â™ª â™ª You have no idea where you are drifting off to â™ª He has had heart problems from childhood itself. But doctor advised against surgery until he reaches this age. We have saved some money. Also, we've registered with the hospital's charity wing. We are waiting for them to give us the date. Don't worry about the money. Okay? Nothing to worry. Everything is okay. Thank you. Load those two sacks, as well. - Priyan, come. - Hello. Jomon! - Hello. - Hello. Our script is complete now. We thought we will show it to you. Is that so? "Evergreen David" "Evergreen" must be David's family name, right? I've had a title in my mind for many years now. - Shall I say it? - Yes, say it. - Say it. - Why not? That's a good thing. "Glass Bangles" - Wonderful! - Is it so? - Very poetic. - Thank you. Bro, aren't we making this film to get rid of this "Bottle" Rajan name? So, if we name it after glass or bottles, people will say that you are promoting bottles. Look, I don't have any issue with the story or the title. But the hero should be Mammootty. - Mammootty! Yes! - Here is your script. Kamal Haasan... - Poetic? - Well, just for a... Rajetta! - Will this work? - It will. Come. Don't be so emotional. I didn't expect Sreejith to be so orthodox. Faizal, you know that my career will be ruined if I don't get a job now. Don't cry. People might notice. I will also be on the look out for any new vacancies. We will solve this. Hey! What's going on in here? It's been a while now. This can't be allowed here. Get going! - What's your problem? - Hey! Doing all this inside the car, is not allowed here. Doing what? Don't talk nonsense! You are the one doing this nonsense here. I just saw it. What did you see? - Don't talk too much. - Faizal, let's leave. Can't stand it if you see a guy and a girl inside a car? Don't push me. I'm warning you. I too have people who will support me. You do whatever you can! Yes, I'll show you! - Nasty guy! - Faizal, let's go. Hey, Sreejith. She sat in a car with her friend. Isn't that the problem? He went to his friend's place in Kannur, saying that she can live as per her wish. I'm not able to reach him. He has some issues as he grew up without his Mom's presence. I spoke with this guy called Faizal. He's a very good chap. He was Keerthy's classmate. So, they met up to discuss about her job. Priyan, I understood that. But she could have informed Sreejith before she went to meet him. Sreejith got upset only because of that. If I need a job, I need to find it myself. That's what Sreejith told me. Then why should I inform him? Moreover, should he be the only one to have a career and an ambition? Wives should always cook and live as per their husband's wishes. Won't this be resolved if you call him and apologise? Why should she apologise for... trying to find a job? Women should become self-sufficient. They shouldn't be living under their husband's shadow forever. If husbands get that impression, women will have to live with them as slaves, forever. That's the reason why I never got married. I don't want to turn anyone into my slave. Bro, we're here to arrive at a compromise, right? Aren't we all here to talk it out? Let's all discuss and reach a decision. You should discuss. And you should reach a decision. But why is this man here? How is he relevant here? Priyetta... I... What's his relevance? He is not married. So, how can he resolve the problems of married couples? Fake! Bro, come with me. What I mean to say is that... unmarried people will have mental... Come on! Come with me! - Does he have any mental issues? - Sorry. Swamy, I'm really sorry. Hey! Hey, you! So, this is what you do every day? Who asked you to do this? - My sister. - Your sister? - Will you do it if your sister tells you? - Yes, I will. Stop it! Let go of me! Didn't I ask you to stop? - Let go of me! - Let go of what? Hey! Hey you! What? - Why did you grab her hand? - When? When did I..? Don't talk nonsense. - I grabbed her hand? - I saw it. Hey! Didn't he grab you? Look! She's crying! I am coming there. You stay there. Don't run. I'm coming. Cruelty against women when I'm here? Are you guys blowing bubbles here? I grabbed her hand. I mean, I caught her red-handed. I saw her diverting the dirty water from the flat to our drainage. - Who? - Vanitha's sister! A guy grabbed your sister! - Who? - A guy in a red t-shirt. - Guy in a red t-shirt? - What's the matter? A guy grabbed her sister's hand and kissed her! Chechi! Where are you going? I don't know! Hey! How dare you grab my sister? Hello. - Priyan sir, it's a mess out here. - What happened? Vanita slapped Shameer saying that he grabbed Sunitha's hand. Oh no! None of you were there to stop this? She slapped him before we could reach there. What will we do now? What can be done? All these issues ultimately end up on me, right? We'll see. Okay? Priyan will come now. Don't say anything in a hurry. Got it? There he comes. Priyan, we came to inform you about something important. Don't get startled when you hear it. I'm already startled here. Tell me. How can I say it? You tell him. You should be telling him. Somebody say it. Please say it. The project that we planned? That will probably... ... be okay! - Is it? - Yes. Mr. George heard the story. He is very happy. Once Mammootty listens to the story tomorrow evening, everything will be okay. By the way, Mammootty is leaving to Dubai, day after tomorrow. So, we must narrate it to him tomorrow evening itself. - We can do that. - You should be with us! One more thing, Priyetta. I'm well aware that you're always on the run. That's why I'm saying this. Please don't commit anything else for tomorrow. - No. - This is a life changing opportunity for us. - I will come, definitely. - Will you be there by evening? - Sure, I will. - Let's leave. - Don't forget. Tomorrow evening! Okay then. Bye. Jomon, get in. I hope this project goes on floors at the earliest. - Hello. - Hello, Priyan? Your loan has been sanctioned. Okay. Thank you, sir. - So, I? - Come here tomorrow itself. - Okay, sir. - Okay. - Hello? - When will you reach tomorrow? I can't come there tomorrow. There is a small issue. I have spoken to Kuttan. He will come there to pick you up. - Kuttan? - Yes . - I will pick you up on the way. - Do you have any problem? No, Mom. Everything is okay. Priya, please tell me if there's anything. No, Mom. No issues at all. Okay? - There's nothing like that. Okay? - Okay okay. Dad and Mom are coming tomorrow. All okay, right? Don't you like having them over? Have I ever told you that I don't like having your parents over? You have time for everything, except for us. How many times did I tell you to call Sreejith? He is leaving for Dubai tomorrow. Do you know that? Why is he going to Dubai? You don't even know that. He messaged Keerthy that he is going to Dubai on a deputation for six months. He can file for a divorce after reaching there, right? You don't care since she is my sister! Why are you talking like that? I am also concerned about her life. I will call Sreejith and talk to him. You run around for everything else. But if I say something, you take a lot of time to do it. Is this like one of those things? This is for my sister. It's regarding her life! What time is his flight tomorrow? I think it's around afternoon. I will call him up and meet him tomorrow. I will definitely meet him. Okay? Leave it to me. Be happy. Dear, ask your mom to be happy. Mom, smile please. Yes, like that! Be happy. I pressed it already. Tomorrow is her PTA meeting. - It's tomorrow? - You forgot! Of course not. How can I forget it? - 9:30, right? - Yes. - You've taken leave, right? - Yes. Tomorrow we will go together, attend the meeting, and have ice cream after that! - What are you searching for? - Where's the popcorn? I won't give it now. You just had dinner, right? Meenu, no. An unknown number? - Hello. - Hello. - Is this Priyadarshan? - Yes. This is from Kakkanad police station. What is it, sir? You should come to the station tomorrow. SI wants to see you. What's the matter? It's about the drainage issue in your apartment. You should be at the station by 9 AM. Sir, tomorrow... Can I come day after tomorrow? I'm a bit busy tomorrow. We cannot do things according to your convenience. We will come and arrest you if you don't come tomorrow. Okay, Sir. Can you please attend the PTA meeting alone? It was a call from the police station. Get inside. - Dad didn't get in. - What's the point? - Hello. - Hello, Priyetta. I just called to remind you. - At what time is the meeting? - You've forgotten? We have to reach the shooting location between 4 PM and 5 PM. No no, I just asked. Thatâ€™s all. I'll be there. You guys can meet over there. I'll reach the location by 3.30 PM. It's better not to wait till 3.30, Priyetta. Let's reach there in the morning itself. Let's not take a risk. No, Jomon. I have some urgent meetings to attend in the morning. After that, I'll reach the location by 3:30 PM. You guys be there. We will narrate the story and rock it! Okay? Mammootty is leaving for Dubai, day after tomorrow. You know, right? Don't worry. Everything will be fine. Okay? - Okay. - Okay, good night. Police station... Bank, Hospital... Airport and then... Mammootty, Dad and Mom. No... Dad and Mom, and then Mammootty. It's decent. It's a decent schedule. - Hello. - Hello. Sreejith, I heard that you are leaving for Dubai? Bro, I couldn't inform you. It was all very quick. Okay. I was planning to visit you. But then I had to go to the police station. Oh! What happened? Nothing serious. It's an issue regarding the drainage in our flat. Will you be home at 11 AM? Oh, no. I'm actually about to leave now. I have to meet some friends. Is it? In that case, shall I reach the airport at 1 PM? I'll come with Keerthy. Bro, you needn't come if you are coming to discuss that. No. I want to discuss some other things as well. So let's meet at the airport at 1 PM. - Okay? - Hello? Is anyone injured? All the officers are busy here. At what time did this happen? - SI sir? - He is in a meeting. Please wait there. The boy has been injured severely, apparently. Sir, he jumped in front of my car. How's that fair? That's just your side of the story. If a case is filed, the victim will become the accused! People won't agree that the boy jumped in front of the car. Then tell me, sir. What should I do? Pay some amount instead of filing a case... ...and settle it outside the station. Or else, you will lose time running behind the case, advocates, courts etc. [Great start! I am at Kakkanad Police station in the morning itself] Sir, what about my car? Let me check the GD entry. I'll let you know. Please wait outside. - Okay sir. - Gopalakrishnan, bring that file. Has Priyan arrived? Priyan will come very soon! - He fooled us. - What? Didn't he say that he would come here? Now, he is asking us to go near the airport. I'm not familiar with the roads in Ernakulam. Then call him. Can't reach him. It's not connecting. As always! What's new in that? The association has already decided to collect the drainage water in the flat, and filter it out, instead of letting it out directly. Sir, this is a plan to fool us. Sir, we just need two months time. See, if it doesn't happen within this time limit, ...you will have to vacate the flat. Think about it. - Hey, you! - Yes. Make a written agreement and get the signatures of both parties. -Got it? - Okay, sir. One more thing. Apart from that, he demands an apology for the incident that happened. - I will apologize, sir. - Not you! That lady. Wasn't she the one who humiliated him? So, she should be apologizing, right? Network is not available. An apology through phone won't work. I want a face to face apology. See, you guys come to an agreement first. Don't call me for this issue again. Let me go, take a leak. Mobile network is down, it seems. - Do you want the apology today itself? - Yes! Didnâ€™t you hear the officer? Okay. We should make her apologize today itself. Sir, I need to go to the airport. Stop it! Are you trying to slip away without solving this issue? Should I put you in the lock-up? Sign that agreement first. If anyone doesn't comply, you will be responsible for everything! Remember that! I understand how busy an IT professional is. But... although she has all the facilities at home, she has many problems because there is no one to take care of her. I do take care of her, but... I had sent a reminder to her father's phone, twice. She has not paid the fees for the last two months. She has great calibre. But she is not able to cope up in her studies. You should be more attentive towards her matters. I will pay the fee today itself. I will make sure that this doesn't happen again. Please, I am sorry if I hurt you. No problem, thank you. Okay, next. - Priyadarshan? - Who? What happened? I tried calling you so many times. I got worried when you said that you were at the police station. Jia? Who are you? What do you want? I came to get a bail. Bail? For whom? Sir, this is my Facebook friend. She is my Facebook friend, Jia. Oh! Got it. Good. Facebook friend! A Facebook friend, even to get him out on bail! Why are you here? There are so many types of friends these days! Sir! Sir, that lady's accident case... CCTV visuals of that lady's accident case. She is lucky. Nothing serious happened. - Are all the procedures over? - Yes, Sir. How is she going? She tried for a taxi, but couldn't get one. Seems like a network issue. - Is it so? - Yes. I got scared when you said that you were in the police station. - Hey! - Well, in our apartment... Hey! Aren't you going to the airport? See this lady? Can you drop her at the airport? Hope you don't mind. He doesn't mind. He will be a good company. You know that he gets into a lot of issues and is a regular here. Should we send this lady with him? So what? Why are you worried about it? Let him take her. This burden will be off our chest. Moreover, this guy carries the entire world's problems on his shoulder! Let this be a golden addition to that! - Do you have any problem? - No. Then leave. I came to solve a drainage water issue in our flat. It turned into a dispute, then a fight and finally brought me here. Do you have Google Pay? Google Pay? - This is not a taxi. - Then? He is going to the airport. Can I trust him? We're sending you from the police station, right? That's exactly why I have a doubt! You can trust him. He is a doctor. We know him well. Whatever! I have to drop by at a couple of places on the way. Hope you don't mind. We can manage if they are not very far. Mom, I am at the beauty salon. I will come soon. What happened? A prospective groom is coming to see me today. That's why I'm getting calls from home. The guy is working in the US. They're looking for a traditional girl. They are hell bent on meeting me. I got your message when... I was at the beauty salon for all these decorations. Hey! Do I look like a kidnapper? No. Should I accompany you? Come. I will drop you, as well. It was not right on your part to come like this. How can you be so irresponsible? It's not fair to make a prospective groom wait like this. I am not going to marry that loser anyway. Let him wait for some time. I cannot marry a complete stranger. Then, what kind of a guy do you prefer? A guy who is in sync with me, a close friend with whom I can share anything. I don't mind even if he is a married man. For that, you have to check matrimonial sites for married men. I think they have some WhatsApp groups as well. That's the right way. There are other ways too, right? Hey! You guys are just friends, right? Please drop me here if you have any plans to elope. I can't take any more complications. Hey! Don't let your imagination go wild. She is just a friend. She is a bit unstable. That's all. Yes. That's why I read all your blogs, no matter how boring they are! This white car? Yes, I saw it. Jomon, get inside. Where is Priyan? Well, aren't you meeting Mammootty today evening? Yes. How is today's schedule? Will you be free at least today, without taking up so many commitments? It's 10 AM now. There's time to meet Mammootty till 5 PM. There's a lot of time left. Priyettan has some urgent errands to run at home. He will meet us at the shooting location after finishing them. Oh no! Will he be late? There is a small apology session in the apartment at 11 AM. I have to reach the bank by 11.30 AM. Then, I have to be in the hospital by 12 PM. I need to go for a compromise meeting at 1 PM. At 3 PM, my parents are coming from Chalakkudy. After picking them up and dropping them at the flat, I can easily reach the location by 4.30 PM. Itâ€™s a decent schedule. Oh my God! Is this your decent schedule? So, aren't you going to drop me? The compromise meeting at 1 PM, is in the airport. Drop me near that taxi stand. I will take a taxi and go. Please wait. Let me drop her first. Will he reach on time? It's better if we go together. Let's not take a chance. I spoke with him yesterday. He knows how important today is. - He will reach. - Okay. Get in. Let's go in Rajan's car. Let's go. [Interval] Hello, Chechi. Priyettan said that he will meet Sreejith today. Did he call you? Last night he called me and said that we'll meet in the morning. I was getting ready. He messaged now, asking me to reach the airport at 1 PM. What happened, Chechi? - Nothing. I will call you back. - Okay. What is it, Mom? Your Dad neither attends calls nor checks messages from the school. What is it? - Tell me, Mom. - I am fed up. - Tell me what happened. - Nothing. [I am fed up. I am going home] [Finish all the problems in the world and come back, when you can] This is my house. Oh, no! Ah, everyone is here! Such great timing! Are you going to have tea from here? No. - Bye then. - Bye. Didn't you have long hair when you left home? Who are you? I am from the beauty salon. I've come to drop the customer. Who is that? I am taking her to the beauty salon. But... Listen! I can't play along with your wrongdoings. Better mind it! Government, we want justice! This is our life! Give us jobs! Give us jobs! Save CPO rank list! Save CPO rank list! Give us jobs! We want justice! This is our life! What's the matter? Bro, no one listens to the problems of common men like us. We heard that the minister is coming here. Who will listen to us? Now, we need to protest in a way that would shock them! [slogans continue] Isn't there any taxi stand nearby? Where are you going from the airport? Why do you want to know that? I just have to make quick stops at the hospital and my apartment. I don't trust you. Who knows who else might get inside the car again! And some fans as well, to top it off! - Hello. - Hello, this is Gibson. Can we meet today? I can't meet today. I need to discuss certain things. I already told you, right? This is about a child. Remember that. Your car hit her and now you are acting like this? How many times did I tell you? Don't you understand? Let us meet so that I can understand. I am on the way to the airport. You need to make a settlement. How many times do I have to call you for this? I have other jobs as well. I know very well how to deal with such blackmailing. But I am not doing it since this is for a child. I am also concerned for the same reason. Let's meet today itself to discuss the final settlement. My office is near the airport. I will send my car. I will WhatsApp the driver's number and car's photo. Okay, I will try. Okay. I will be expecting you. I will try. I can't promise. No, you have to confirm. I am not taking any other meetings today. Okay, then. Doctor, just be a driver for the time being! Well , I was just checking if there's a problem... Look out! Oh no! Madam! Madam! Madam! Madam, are you okay? Are you okay? Sorry, I got distracted for a second. Where were you looking while driving? See? The mirror broke. You came through the wrong side. My mirror is broken too. Really? What? My husband is an expert driver. Didn't it break because you were over-speeding? Do you know how much it will cost to repair this? - Ask him! - What should I do now? If you could give money... Why are you asking like a beggar? This car is mine. Ask him properly. Shall we settle it? - I don't have any option. - I have only... I have only my card. There is an ATM nearby. Let's go and withdraw money. Stop it! It was your mistake. Don't try to justify it. Go and file a case if you have any complaint. Hey, let's go! You want to pay them money? You deserve this. Are you happy now that they blamed you for their own mistake? Let them say what they want. Such conflicts are part of this city's daily routine. I don't care. A lady in a scooter jumped in front of my car with her kid. She didn't even have a licence. That's how I met with that accident. I even paid money to settle the case. I'm still in a soup because of that. Send the load today itself. I hope this shirt is okay. - Shall we leave? - Yes. - Let me pray first. Please get me a good photo with Mammootty! Please protect the bottles! Let's go! Bro, your shirt looks awesome! I bought it yesterday. We have to click the photo, right? Rajetta! They are also coming with us. Rajetta, are we going on a tour? My wife and kids are bigger fans of Mammootty, than me. Just come with me. Today we are just going there to narrate the story to Mammootty. So, why take everyone along? Let them also hear the story. It is good, right? If they hear it, the suspense element will be lost. Is that so? Once we get the dates from Mammootty, we can take them to the location, have food from there, take photos, do whatever we want. So, I'll tell them not to come now, right? - Yes, please. - Just a minute. All of you get down. I'll go and meet Mammootty, narrate the story, and after that, bring Mammootty here! Isn't that better? Everyone get down now. Come on, get down. For the time being, let me go and click a photo with him. Okay then. Let's go now. Turn the vehicle around. Shobha, don't worry. Charity guys will take care of it. Priyan sir is here. Hello. Is it ready, sir? I'll come to the bank. Yes. No. There's a small issue in my flat. No. I will come, sir. Varkey, didn't you go to the hospital? I just came back after admitting him. I will go back in the afternoon. Shobha called just now and said that there's some delay. It will be okay. What was that, by the way? They were the tenants of 3B. They are the third family to vacate this flat. All are scared. Listen, I have signed an agreement for the drainage water issue. Please call the guys who fix the filter, and follow up things. I'll do that. Gopal, please give this upstairs. Neena and your daughter had come. They left immediately! I think she's really angry. Oh I forgot to call them! What can we do about Vanitha and Sunitha? If she doesn't apologize, it will be a huge issue. My dear sir, please talk to her yourself. If I try to talk to her, she will slap me as well. Come with me. Why can't he leave the keys inside the car? Hey, you! Come here. - I need a chair. - Who are you? What all do you want to know to give a chair to a sick person? Whatever it may be, you shouldn't have slapped him. He was really indecent to my sister, sir. But you shouldn't have slapped him. You should apologize to him. Why should I apologize? If you don't apologize... I have to be somewhere urgently. I am saying this for our own good. I will apologize. Can you give my sister a chance to act in your movie? Please. Why are you mixing the apology with a role in the movie? I haven't become a big shot writer yet. We know that it is a lie. If you try, you can easily give a role to my sister. Tell me if it's possible or not? I will apologize only then. Shameer and his friends are here to hear the apology. Can you please...? Okay. Apologize to him. I'll get her a role. Okay then. Call that scoundrel. Hey, shoot a video of her apology. - I'll do it. - Make it fast. Record it fully. Then, I need a video of me slapping him! But that's already over! We can do it again. - What? - The slap! I don't want the video then. Stop acting too smart. Apologize now. This is the SI's order. Sir, if he doesn't talk appropriately to women, I will slap him again. Then I will file a case. Just a minute. Take the video without her noticing it. She is so arrogant. Sir, what's it? Your sister needs a role with lot of dialogues, right? - Yes. - Is that what you want? - Yes. Can you make her the heroine of the movie then? That's not possible. She will be given a powerful role with dialogues. - That's enough. - Just apologize to him now. - Will you fool us? - No, I won't. Apologize now. I trust you, sir. That's why. They are coming. Say it. I apologize. Is this an apology? Is this how you apologize? This is not enough. I apologize for the slap this time! - That was good. - Shameer bro, you won! Go and continue your cleaning! How stupid are you guys? Who asked you to clap? We could have made her apologize at least three times. Sir, please don't forget about my sister's role. - No. The show here is over. Shall we move? All your urgent errands are such rubbish things? Who has an imbalance in the head? You or me? You can sit in front. No. This is the safest position while travelling, especially when the driver is a stranger. Moreover, I am not your wife or girlfriend. Priyan, I heard that this flat is going to be demolished. I could go home if you give me this month's salary. I don't want to see the the poor tenants going to the streets. Are you mad? My parents are coming in the evening. Go! Yeah, right! That was the only thing missing here! Varkey, don't forget to go to the hospital. I'm leaving right away. Can you switch off the radio? Give me some peace of mind. Don't you like music? You said earlier that you had to stop by somewhere. I need to get a passport size photo clicked. It's not necessary, in between your busy schedule. I'll come right away. I will be real quick. Will you keep me waiting again? No, I'll be back very soon. - Is the A/C on? - Yes. Hey! Hey! Who parked this car here? Lower the window. Who parked this here? - Driver. - Driver? - And where is he now? - He has gone inside the bank. Give me his phone number. I don't know his phone number. What's his name? I don't know his name. Hey! Move that car. I will move it. Please, Madam. That is the bank's vehicle. Can you please move your car? - Who? Me? - Yes. If I could move this car, I would have left in this car. You can move it. - The key is here. - I don't know how to drive! You are working as a security guard without knowing how to drive? Why should I know driving for that? - It's getting late. - Go and call him. He is inside. I'll move it. Hello! KL 07 BQ 1396? KL 07... KL 07 BQ 1396? Sir, is it your Honda City that's parked outside? - No. - Okay. Hello... KL 07 1396? Hey, what are you doing? Sir, someone parked their car in the front. What were you doing then? - I was... - Sort it out quickly. - Such a nuisance! - Has he gone somewhere else? Move it fast. We have to go to the next branch. The driver is not there. What can I do? - Get someone to move it. - Get whom? We have to go to the next bank. I understand that! Such irresponsible people! Don't they have decency? - What's the matter? - See how they have parked? What do I say? There is a lot of space here. He didn't park there. - He had to park here itself. - Do something fast! I checked inside. He is not there. What can I do? Some people have no decency. Okay Sir. - Hey! Hey! - What can I do? - KL 07 BQ 1396! - What's wrong with him? Come on now! Come! Honda City.. There it goes! What's your name? What? What's your name? Priyadarshan. Say your phone number as well. What's that for? If someone asks me your name when you leave me in this car again, I have to say something! Are you a Homeo Doctor? Yes. What's your name, Madam? Priscilla. What? Priscilla Thankam. Priscilla Thankam. Nice name! Very nice! Rajetta, move a bit to your left. Yes, that's it. Fold your arms. Priyetta, we've reached. Mammootty is here at the location. The meeting won't happen without you. You know that, right? Please don't be late. - What did he say? - He said that he will reach on time. - That's good. - Did you get it? Yes. Here it is. Didn't you get the car number? Then we won't get your head! Number should be there! - Then you'll have to sit. - I'll sit. Don't sit like you are about to poop in an open field! - Sit in a stylish way. - I can't do better than this! - Show it. - Here. Why can't you be the cameraman for our movie? Can't you do it? I've reached. I'm at the hospital entrance. Okay. It's 1.30 PM! I thought you won't be coming. Operation procedures have started. Sorry, it took some time to arrange the fund. Okay. Don't tell them that it's from me. No. We've told them that it's just a normal charity fund. Okay. Thank you. How is the boy? He is fine. We will take care. - Okay. - Okay. We want justice! [slogans continue] Stop here. - Move aside. - Sir. What's the matter? This guy came to see the strike. After some time... ...he went up there. We don't know why. Oh! Who is it? We don't know. Get down! - Get down! - I will jump now. Don't jump! Hey! - Come down. - No. I will jump! Can you please stop shouting? Okay. Don't stop then. - Please don't jump! - Sir! There is a solution for everything. Don't jump! - We want justice! - Sir, this guy looks familiar. - Why is he doing this to me? - Sir, the minister will reach now. - I'll jump! - Isn't he that relative of Priyadarshan? The guy who taught about revolution to the police. - Yes, sir. Call him. Call Priyadarshan. Give it to me. Also, give his car number. Hello, Control Room! - I will jump! - I'll give you a car number. Catch hold of its owner Priyadarshan and bring him here immediately. - Over! Over! - I will sacrifice my life! - Hey! - 67... Uh oh! Can't these guys shut up? Ask them to send his car number. - I will get down. - Not that way! Not that way! Through the other side! I can't shout any more. My throat hurts. I can't do it. Don't just stand here. Get that number quickly! - Sir, he will jump now. - Control, CP 11314 calling. KL 7 BQ 1396 Trace the person driving this car and bring him to the Corporation Office immediately. It's very urgent. Over. Mom. Buy a soap for us when you come. Mom! We have soap here. Your dad has a hair-fall issue. So, he needs an Ayurvedic soap. Can it wait till tomorrow? - Is it required today itself? - Yes, today! - Okay then. - Mom! Did you commit any new task? All this is usual. Mom needs an Ayurvedic soap... ...today itself. I had to reach the airport at 1 PM. It's already 2 PM now. We're nowhere near the airport! I am stuck with you! We can make them stop and hold it, for one hour. Stop time? This is the first time I'm seeing someone who can stop time. I don't have any other tasks. We are heading to the airport. Why are you going to the airport? I have an antique showroom in Ernakulam. Many items I imported have some customs clearance problem. I have to sort that out. Only I know how difficult it is to run that shop. My Mom started it. Now it's on my shoulders. I don't have time to run the shop. Also, I can't find anyone trustworthy enough to manage it. Can you suggest a responsible person who can run the shop efficiently? What? I can give them a good salary. There will be a lot of issues if the guy is not trustworthy. I'm already struggling to balance everything on my head and shoulders! Should I take this up too? Here, you can get a passport size photo in 5 minutes. I'll wait. Ma'am, can you please smile? Bring it to the right. Madam! I was searching for an Ayurvedic shop to buy the soap. Did you get the photo? Is this the one? This is from Kakkanad police station. They are calling to check whether I dropped you. It's okay. We're going to the airport, right? You could have smiled for the photo. I have emotional imbalance, mood swings and depression too. I get angry and sad... ... if I don't take my medicines on time. I will lose control over my mind. Doctor, do you have any medicine for this? We do have medicines. But it's not as strong as the one you are having. It will be sweet. I will give that. To have so many medicines, what happened to you? I only had my Mom. Yet, we were really happy with our life. Mom was running the antique shop. Mom always taught me how to enjoy life and to stay happy. Basically, I am an introvert. She was the one who brought me out of that shell. The happiest moments of my life were the times I spend with my Mom... ... after completing my course, until the results came. But that happiness... was short-lived. Mom fell sick. Mom was stuck either in the hospital or at home, for the longest time. That routine became my life. I didn't believe the doctors' prediction that Mom will never come back. I strongly believed that my Mom will come back. I didn't have anything else to wish for. But when I felt that my Mom was telling me that... ... she wanted to leave this miserable world, I signed the consent letter. I threw her into the hands of death. I suffered for a long time thinking that I did a wrong thing. I argued with myself. Somewhere along the way, I lost my mind too! Hello, honey. I've reached the location. I clicked a photo with Mammootty's car! No, I'll be talking to Mammootty in some time. I'll do a video call then. Assemble all our neighbours and club members there. Don't call our workers. We will lose money if they don't work for a day. Call Elsy too. Let her also see it. Okay. I'll call later. Hey! - Shall we go and meet Mammootty? - Let Priyan come. - Why should Priyan come? - To narrate the story. - Can't you narrate it? - I can, but... - Priyettan has written it. - So what? So it would be better if he narrates it. So, you guys don't know the story? Call him instead of swallowing that thing! - Yes, Jomon. - Priyetta... - Where are you? - I'm on my way. How long will it take for you to reach here? Oops, Police! Just a minute... Priyettan? Hello? - Hello? - I would have lost my license now! Don't you know that you shouldn't use your phone while driving? Especially in my car! "My car"? Is that how things are now? It's Jomon. Can you please attend that call? Please put it on loudspeaker. - Hello. - Priyetta, where are you? Jomon, I'm on the way. I'll surely reach there. Isn't Mammootty there till 4:30 PM? We are waiting for you. Don't be late. I'll be there soon. Very soon. Okay? Okay. He is on the way. Why are you meeting Mr. Mammootty? What's there to laugh? It's the first time I'm hearing someone calling him "Mr. Mammootty". Actor Soman called him like this in the movie "No:20 Madras Mail". A director said that Mammootty liked one of my stories. If we meet Mammootty today with it, we can announce this movie project. How do you handle your job and scripting together? Stories come to my mind while I'm on the run, like today. I don't know how to write stories sitting alone in a private space. [Where have you reached? The car and driver are waiting for you] Drop me here! - I'll get down here. - Iâ€™ll drop you. - No. Drop me here. - Are you sure? Yes, I'm sure. - What happened? - I'll get down here. Didn't you say that you have some customs clearance at the airport? That's fine. I want to get down here. If there's a problem, I can solve it. What if it's a problem that you cannot solve? I will wait. You go and... It's okay. You please leave. Oh no! The whole neighbourhood must have reached my home now. Hey! Come here. My wife is calling me. Shall we meet Mammootty now? He is shooting a scene now. He will be free after that. Priyan will also reach by then. This will become a much bigger scene! - Oh no! - Look, she is calling again! What do I do now? What should I say? - Did you switch it off? - No, I switched it on. It's on? Hello... Mammootty speaking! No, I mean I will speak to Mammootty soon! I'll come on video call then. okay? Who asked you to attend the call? Try him again! - Call Priyan. - He is calling. Who? - Who is there? - The Director. Who made you a production controller? You don't have any control! He is upstairs. Please come. When it got late, I thought you won't be coming. Well, you have to come anyway! I was told that the kid was not severely injured in the accident. Despite that, I gave money and helped you. Then why are you troubling me again? Hey, don't be in a hurry. I too have something to say, as the kid's uncle. Sit down. Please sit down. I heard that you let your Mom die, because you are a miser. I have only considered it as gossip. But it's wrong not to share the ancestral property with the rightful heirs. That's none of your business! What's your intention? Initially, we thought that the kid is fine. We noticed some issues when we did a detailed check-up. It won't be solved with such little money. As my sister and brother-in-law are naive, they won't demand much. But as the kid's uncle, I can't help but intervene. I can't believe what you are saying. Let me check first. If you go and check, you will be humiliated. The amount I asked for, is not such a big deal for you. I don't have that much money with me. Haven't I told you not to call me frequently? I'll have to go to many places as part of my duty. Don't doubt me unnecessarily. But how can I... What? A woman's voice? There's no woman here. You are imagining things because you are crazy! Please calm down, dear. Calm down. I am telling you, right? It's nothing. Aren't you my sweetheart? I'll be there very soon. Kisses! To be frank, I had seen the CCTV visuals. I know that it was my sister's child who jumped in front of your car. I will make some adjustments. But you should also understand me and make adjustments. What do you mean? Contrary to what you think, I'm not a bad guy. What I mean is that... ...this is my ambition. I want to hug you tight and kiss you! - Move! - It's my desire! Move away! Hey! Get away from me! Hey! My phone! Hey! Who are you? I am Dr. Priyadarshan. Doctor? I am her doctor. Can you please give my phone? I've been treating her for depression. She fell in love with me during the course of the treatment. Love? She even came to my house yesterday. My wife left me because of that. Can you please give my phone? See? It's a voice recorder. She records everything we say and uses it to blackmail us. Then she sends it to our family. These are all slow poisons... ... to commit suicide. Suicide? Look! My wife sent me this message and left me today. - She said she won't come back. - Oh my God! It's okay. You guys enjoy. No no. We were not enjoying. You are mistaken. Doctor, take her and leave! I just came for my phone. It's okay if your family is okay with this. I too have family issues. My wife can't know about this. Please take her with you! Hey lady! Just a minute! There is nothing between us. I don't want any money. I don't want any compensation. Please leave! - What I'm saying is... - Bro, listen... It was a mistake. Please show mercy! That Jose from the club... I did this because he stirred me up. So, please forgive me. I'm not in this any more. I was trapped! Please leave. Please! Please! - Sorry! - Leave it. I'll take care of it. Just leave immediately! Leave now. Go! Get lost, you crazy lady! Thank God! Thank God! Hey! Come on! What all were you saying about me back there? I don't have the strength to beat him. I could only beat him by narrating a cooked up story. We are lucky that it worked! Why did you come here instead of going to the airport? - My phone was with you. - Oh, sorry. There were several missed calls. Is that so? Oh, no. There are some calls from the police station. Good that you came here. - I have to go to the wash-room immediately. - What? - I have to go to the wash-room immediately. - Wash-room... 10 minutes. Just 10 minutes. I'll get you to the airport. You can use the wash-room there. We will reach soon. The wash-room is over there. Thank you. Sreejith, where are you? I'm about to leave. It's time to check-in. I'm at the airport parking lot. What's your location? Where are you standing right now? I'm at the cafeteria. Okay. Here I come! Keerthy! - Yes, Priyetta! - Shall we sit there? Excuse me. Can I have this chair please? Sit. Sreejith... I'll call Faizal for you. - Please talk to him. - No... Bro, that is not required. It was my mistake. It was my misunderstanding. I've realized that. There are husbands who don't allow their wives to work. Sreejith, I don't think you are such a husband. If this discussion is one-sided, I don't have anything to say. I don't have any problem if she works. Oh! Don't change your words! "Let me see how you get a job". Isn't that what you used to say? Don't intervene. Sreejith, you continue. In order to get back at me, she is always on her phone. Chatting and what not! Didn't you say that I might get into affairs if I go for a job? - Isn't it true? - Bro, let me ask you something. I'm the earning member in our house. I provide her food, clothing and everything she needs. I treat her like a queen. Is there anything that I don't provide for her? You don't have to work so hard and provide for me. I'll work. You can stay at home. I can also take good care of you. This is her attitude. This is her attitude when I say something. Do you know how silly she is? Once, on Facebook... when I didn't "like" her post, she didn't talk to me for a week! She changes her WhatsApp DP whenever we have an argument. She'd put up a picture that says 'Dark'! Her status messages are as long as trains! Why should the public know about it? What do you gain from it? What about your DP? Alone on the foothills and contemplating on the infinite! Change that DP. Why don't you use our photo as DP? - Can you do that? - Show some maturity first! Yeah, right! As if he's really mature! You made your parents call me saying I don't make chapattis for you every night. Should I bring some other woman to make chapattis for me? I didn't study MBA to make chapattis for you! Just a minute. Please don't fight in a public space. Shall I ask you something? Do you have any issue if I arrange a job for Keerthy? Don't you trust me? It's not that. I don't have any issue. Keerthy, won't you be able to care for Sreejith even while working? Why do you ask that? Will I ever stop caring for Sreejith? I don't think there is any serious issue between you two. It's all very silly. It will be resolved if you talk for just 15 minutes. What time is your flight? - Soon. - I too have to leave for something urgent. Keerthy, sit here and talk for some time. Sit, Keerthy Sit. Thank you. - Okay then. See you. - Okay. - Why did you involve Priyettan...? - One minute. Forgot my phone! We can't do anything till we get clearance from archaeology department. - So that's the issue. - That's why we asked you to come here. Anyway, it's sorted now, right? Yes, it's fine. - Do I have to come here again? - No need. Excuse me! Huh? You haven't left yet? I want to tell you something. - All these are okay? - Yes, Ma'am. That job at your antique shop... Can you hire my relative for that job? You ran all the way here to say that? I'm okay if you know the person well. Thank you. So, can you give me a missed call on my number? I will call and confirm. - Okay. - Thank you. - Mr.Priyan! - Yes. If you don't mind, can I come with you? I... I will be running around till night. After all we have gone through, I'm curious to see how it will end. I'll help you by handling your phone, while you are driving. Then it's okay. - So, straight to the movie location next? - No. I have to pick up my parents. I just have to drop them at my flat. That's all. We have been waiting here for so long! We could have gone ourselves. As always, he must be running a hundred errands! He is your son, after all! As if you don't have anything to do with it! Priyettan is here. I'll be right back. Where the hell were you? We have been waiting for so long. I had to go to the hospital, and then, to the bank, and there was an issue at the police station too. That's why it took me so long. You haven't changed at all! Hey, come here. Let me tell you what to do. Go straight and you will reach Kalamassery . Take the left to enter the Medical College route. Follow the Seaport-Airport road till Bharat Mata College. Take the left near the petrol pump to reach the flat! I don't know any college. It's my first time in Ernakulam. Follow me in your car. Hey! Follow his car! What is this? Can we abandon those poor animals back home? No, you can't. Hey, Priyan! - Who is that? - My dear Mom, it's my friend. What kind of friend? She is really my friend. I gave her a lift. That's all. Get home first. - Did you finish all the water? - No. A little is left. Let's go! - Are you Priyadarshan? - Yes Sir. We have been calling you for so long! Why aren't you answering? I was really busy. I took her to the airport. I'm dropping her home now. Your cousin is about to jump from the roof of the Corporation office! - Is it Kuttettan? - I don't know that. Minister is coming there at 4 PM for a function. I've been told to get you there before that. Sir, I have a meeting at 5 PM. Can I come after that? Mr.Priyadarshan, police are running around all over Kochi city, looking for you. You should come with us immediately. Or else, we will have to arrest you and take you there. Sir, I'll come. Hey! Start your vehicles! [protest slogans] - Sir, that looks like his car. - He has reached. We got him! That's our police! Move aside. - Hey, come here. - Come quickly! You haven't dropped her yet? I dropped her at the airport. She said she will come with me and... ...I can drop her later... That's how she is here. Stop talking and look up there! If you don't get him down, I will jump from there! Minister will be here soon. There's no time to play! Come with me. 2 cops, follow me! Move away! - You can leave only after this is resolved. Come. Come on! He is up there. He wants to die. Go and check. You guys go with him. - Catch him fast. - Okay Sir. Quick! Let me take a tablet for my pressure. Dear Lord! He is my relative. I'll talk to him. Let him go. He is a relative. Kuttetta! Why are you here? What's your intention? Won't you allow me to live peacefully? I had to do this in order to open the eyes of the ruling class! Why are you on this rooftop to open their eyes? Why can't they give ranks to those who have studied hard? They are protesting because they didn't get jobs despite being in the rank list! Oh! Why are you sacrificing your life for them? Who are they to you? People protest... ...for the betterment of society! It's not for themselves. I'm not here to discuss political philosophy! Come down with me right now! Priyan, I won't admit defeat. Defeating me should not be your definition of winning! My story was presented on stage for the first time, because you gave me a chance, intentionally or otherwise. Today is an important day, just like that day. I have to leave, as soon as possible. Now, you can decide what to do! What will I do? Minister will be here soon! Where is your relative? Where is he? Tell me where he is! Cat got your tongue? - Can't you answer? - Come here! Sir, here he is! You rascal! You cannot squash my protests with this slap. We will see that! Get him to the station. His pointless protest! He is coming out. Move aside. Don't crowd around! All of you move back! Let us get him inside. Don't push. Move back! Get him inside. Open the door properly. Cover him properly. Oh my God, the Collector! What should I do? Please allow us to get him inside the jeep. - Sir! - Why are you dressed like a clown? What is happening here? A guy was planning to jump from the top. We arrested him. No need to arrest! Minister will come now. Clear everyone. Hey don't arrest him. Collector asked us to let him go. Minister is going to come now. Stop it. Calm down. - Long live the revolution! - Hey, Priyan! Priya, take with nuisance with you. Come. Please take him somewhere else. Get lost! - Come on! - My spectacles? - My glasses. - I'll get it. Hold this and stand here. I'll get it. Move that vehicle. Please come, sir. The venue is over there. Get going, man! Who are you? Here you go. That's my friend. Come here. Friend? Which friend? Here comes Priyettan! Why are the police and military here? Are you into gold smuggling? My dear Dad, I will explain. Just come with me. Ask him about that woman in his car! Mom, please don't...! I too saw her. She looks suspicious! I understood everything. He is cheating us! - Poor Neena! - Please get inside. - Dad, get inside. - Move inside! Don't push. I have to drive! - You know the way, right? - I don't know! Kuttettan knows it. It's already very late. Are you going anyway? There's half an hour. We will make it. Hello? I am on my way. I'll be there. - All the best. - Thank you. - Where is the shoot happening? - Over there. You can't go in. Shoot is in progress. - I have to meet someone. - It is not possible. Chetta! Bro, can I meet Mammootty? Sir left 10 minutes ago. What on earth have you done? We have been waiting here for more than 3 hours! And you think you can come and go as you please! But it's not 4:30 PM yet. Did you have to wait till 4:30 PM? I told you so many times, to come early! Mammootty's shoot got done early and he left! My biggest desire is to click a photo with Mammootty. I am making this movie for that. You know that? You know what? A boatman should row his boat. A barber should cut hair. Like that, there's a job meant for each person. You can only do that. Let me tell you something. Homeo doctor should only give medicines to patients. Got it? You should not be going around cheating people! And you call yourself a writer? Find someone else, man! - Rajettan is absolutely right! - Hello? Where are you going? This project didn't happen right? You can walk back home! - We are leaving! - We? - Where to? - With you. I'll slap you! You are responsible for all this! Bloody pig! You don't know me well enough! - My bag is in the car. - You don't know "Bottle" Rajan well! - Let's go. Get out of the way. - Rajetta! My bag! Only I know how difficult it is to find a producer! Are you both satisfied? "If the writer is not interested, why should we do this script?" That's what they asked. My Bag! Is anyone going to Kaloor? Kaloor? Is anyone going to Kaloor? I'm leaving the film industry. There is no other way. The situation at my home is such. Dad is pushing me a lot... ... to go to the Middle East on a Visiting Visa. I have no other option to survive now. Everything will be alright. Nothing will be alright! No, leave it. - Okay then. - Should I drop you? No. I will take a rickshaw. I will drop you home. Okay then. Wait, I'll get an umbrella. - Thank you. - Okay, then. - You have my number, right? - Yes. - Call me when you are free. - Okay. Okay then. Mr. Priyadarshan! One minute. Can I ask you something? One of your biggest dreams was supposed to become a reality today, right? Why did you run around for others instead of giving importance to that? Doesn't everyone give priority to themselves over others? All of us have played "Lemon-Spoon" race during our childhood. One in which we place the lemon onto the spoon... At the end of the game, it doesn't matter who finishes first. What matters is that the spoon should still hold the lemon, when we finish. I don't wish to abandon people around me to finish first. Even if abandon them and become successful in life, I can never be happy about it. We'll surely see. Thank you. Bye. Hello? Priyan sir... The surgery is over. Doctor said that he is fine. We're feeling relieved, finally! I'll be there in the morning, sir. Okay. Priyan! Hey, Priyan! Your father and mother are here. I've asked Vanitha to leave the food upstairs. Thank you, bro. - Okay. - Priyan! I heard that the filter will be fixed tomorrow? I was worried that we'll have to vacate this place, son. - I am happy now. Thanks. - Okay. Hey, Priyetta! I reached yesterday. I couldn't reach on time for her delivery. Thanks a lot for everything. Okay then. See you. "Evergreen David" [Priyadarshan's Diary] Who tied this cow here? I don't know. Hey, Security! Dad! - What did you eat for breakfast? - Appam and egg curry. - Who made it? - Mom! - How was it? - It was nice! - Is it? - Where's the Ayurvedic soap? Grandma! Awww! Grandma's darling! How is your uncle doing, dear? Your uncle... Oh, yeah! Uncle is doing fine, Mom! Is it? - Shall we go, meet Grandpa? - Yes. Come with me. - Grandpa! - Look who's here! My dear child! - Where were you? - Keep your volume down! There are neighbours here! - Hey! - I'm talking to my grandchild! Hereafter, I won't go anywhere, leaving you guys behind. Everything else comes only after the two of you, for me. Keerthy had called me. She told me that you met them yesterday. There's nothing wrong in running around to help people. But it will be good if you bring it down a bit, as per your capacity. And I know that you won't abandon us. What happened? You are the hero of the day! Huh? [Priyan is on the run] - Neena, dear.. - Yes! Please come here. My extraordinary day... with an ordinary man. Here, I am sharing that experience with you all. "Priyan is on the run" In today's world, when everyone has forgotten everything around them, thinking only about themselves, and are running around for their own needs and achievements, here's a man, who never let go of anything around him, while running around this city for a whole day, changing the lives of so many people. During this exciting and entertaining run, I too had to run along with him. But while he was on this run, he sacrificed his biggest dream, that was just an arm's length away. Yet, without feeling any guilt or remorse about it, he continues running. To protect the privacy of certain people, some names have been changed. Sir, I have sent you a mail. Can you please check it? It's a new draft. I thinks this is a little more better... than the story we planned. Can you please check and let me know? Okay, sir. Alright. - George! - Yes, Mammootty sir. Ask him to come and meet me. Okay. Mom, did Priyettan leave? - I saw him leaving just now. - Oops! I forgot! Priyetta! We have to drop our daughter for dance class at 3 PM. Won't you reach on time? Have to meet Prince at the hospital, arrange a new job for Kuttettan, and then, the cow. It's decent.
