I can't wait to go to Roxy's tonight, man. The party's going to be far out. Even I can't wait. Hey, man, you got an a extra lit? Find your own stash, man! Come on man! How about that lit? I got cash, man. Hey, hey, man! You're here to see that ex, P? That old private dick is a gropy son of a bitch, man! Yes, yes. ...stay the hell away! - Mr. Nyte I presume? - Presume away. I hope you brought that cheque for 500 hours - like you promised me? - I did indeed, sir. Although the cheque will be yours when the story is mine. I'll be recording this interview to see if it has any merit. If so, you'll get the cheque. And then I'll come back with a camera crew and we'll do an exclusive News 11 interview. Yes, yes, fair enough. Hey, you want a drink or something? No, no, thank you. Okay, because I'm about to spill the beans on the real caper behind which you media people have labeled "The final goodbye." Oh, you can judge for that, sir. This is Dave Dugan, KYW TV3 News here with Harry Nyte, renown Cleveland private investigator. Ten years ago, to this very day, a major gangland massacre blemished our fair city. The best location in the nation. The massacre has be coined by the people of Cleveland, Ohio as "The final goodbye." And today finally, after ten long years, Harry Nyte will reveal the true facts behind the story. Go ahead, Harry. It's all yours. Please begin. In 1961, my solo career as a PI wasn't really making ends meet. It was tough getting by. Then one day I was sitting at my desk reading a popular men's magazine. You know, for the articles, of course. And I hear these footsteps coming down the hall. Come on in. I don't stand on the ceremonies. Hello, Harry. I hope I'm not disturbing you. Oh, Lisa. My, my, my! If it isn't the laundry girl from downstairs. I'm not working at the shop today, Harry. Oh, well, have a seat. That's right. Your father is Anton Stromberg. One of the wealthiest men in Cleveland. Alright. Well, what can I do for you? It's Cynthia, my younger sister. Yeah. - She's been kidnapped. - Kidnapped? The bastards are asking for $100,000 in small bills. Or else, they will, well... they will kill Cynthia. One hundred thousand dollars, is that all? That's not enough? Well, no, no, no. That's a tidy sum, but, uh, for your father that's small change. Their tab should be much higher. What should we do? Truthfully, you should go to the Cleveland police. Or better, yet the FBI at the Standard building. - That's what you should do. - No, Harry. My parents are determined to leave the officials out of this. The kidnappers threatened to kill Cynthia. As a private detective, isn't there something you could do? Get clues. Anything, please. Alright, alright. I can't make any promises, but I'll do some checking around and see what I can do. Well, well, well, what have we got here? Could it be the most important man in Cleveland? Harry Nyte. What the hell brings you into my office? Can't you see I'm involved in a corporate meeting with my chocolate malt? Why don't you tell that executive you're sipping on that another client requests the services of Frankie The Snitch esquire. - Or should I say-- - Okay, okay, okay. Enough of the usual banter. What can I do for you gumshoe? Well, it's like this kid. Whenever I want the best information on the street, for some reason I think about you. Alright, alright. Enough of the bullshit here. Look, I need all the lowdown you got on the recent kidnapping. Which one? What do you mean by that? Seems there's been a rash of kidnappings lately. The latest being Anton Stromberg's daughter Cynthia. Just the name I was going to drop on you. Alright, come on. Tell me more. Well, Harry, if you want somebody's insider tips, well, you have to make a little donation. Okay, that's fair enough. Alright, now tell me what you know. Come on. Okay, well. Well, it's like this. I had to the ransom. And the loved ones are found shortly after, alive. Let me guess. The kidnappers always ask for $100,000, am I right? Are you sure your name ain't Chris Wall? You know, they keep the ransom demand low, the swells pay you off. They don't make a stink. Hmm, you know, that's a sweet racket. You're some kind of Sherlock Holmes. There's something else you really should know. Well, go ahead, shoot. What? Word has it that Bobby Darrow is behind the snatching. Bobby Darrow? Now, why would a big time gangster like Bobby Darrow be doing with penny any kidnappings? Don't kid yourself. That cheap bastard is the only person I know who could squeeze a penny to make Abe Lincoln cry. He's getting a 100k per snatch, tax free. You know, that makes sense. You just may have something there like good snitch. I have information from a reliable source. And I believe, I know who's behind Cynthia's abduction. You what? Oh, she's not in any danger. She's but one of many kidnapped victims in the Cleveland area recently. This party targets wealthy individuals like yourselves or siblings. They demand a fast $100,000 ransom which is promptly paid due to quick access to funds. You have no substantial proof of any of this. And just talking to us right now could be jeopardizing Cynthia's life. My husband is right. Let us tend to this matter. Listen... none of the other kidnapped victims have been harmed. And I want you to pay the ransom. Originally, I told Lisa here to call the police or the FBI, but that was before I got wind of these particular criminals. All I want to do is observe the ransom drop. We were told specifically, no outside contact - with anyone. - Get with it, dad! Harry's just trying to help. Listen, I can almost guarantee Cynthia's safety. This is not your average kidnapping. These current snatchers are being performed by... if I'm right, professional organized gangsters and their object is quick cash, not murder. Unless Cynthia does something outrageous to piss them off, she'll be returned safe and sound once you pay the ransom. Scalise, how long are we going to put up with this shit? Kidnapping, I answer the kids. It's just simply not my forte. Bobby's got to be off his freaking nut! He's the boss. The man's got his reasons. Oh, I know what the reason is. It's greed. Ever since your body bought into legitimate enterprises, he's paying big taxes. His ransoms, they're under the table profits with no taxes and we get nothing. Yeah, ran over all the loots of Bobby Darrow and end up with the squat. I don't see any bonuses coming in. I don't see any bonuses coming in. Nimbles is right, boss. Our leader is not taking care of his flock. Hell, you've been his right hand man since freaking 39 and you got nothing to show for. Where is your place of honor? I just need to see who picks up the cash. Don't you dare do anything that would jeopardize my daughter's safety! Let him do the job, or I'll call the police myself! Alright, calm down! You're going to give me a nervous breakdown. Alright, Lisa. We'll go ahead with your Mr. Detective here. If that's alright with you? I'm alright with observing from a distance. I will contact you just as soon as I hear about the money drop. - You're both right. - We're going to make our move? Yeah. It's time to push Bobby aside. Alright! That's what I like to hear. I've been waiting to hear that for so many freaking years. It's not even funny. Alright! Hey, who took that little twit to the toilet last? Me, boss. It's Jake's turn! Jake's turn! Jake's turn. Okay, okay. Somebody's got to do it. You creeps! You lousy thugs! I got to use the bathroom again. Can't you troops tell when a girl's in need? - Hey, kid! - You ruined bastard! Hey, zip that mouth and quiet down! Hey, she's our guest. Show some manners, huh. Wait till my father gets all you gangsters, you'll pay dearly for what you've done! Okay, kiddo, let's go potty. You better behave or I'm going to let you have it. Alright, you little brat. Don't take too long or I'll smack the shit out of you. Hurry up! Come on! Come on! Give me a few minutes, daddio. Give a girl a break, will ya. Come on! Hurry up you little scamp! I ain't got all day. Alright, that's it. I'm going in there. You know, you're more trouble than your worth. Ransom or no ransom, I'll kill you. Hey, hey, Mr. Stromberg. You did alright. Hey, listen. Without a shadow of a doubt, Bobby Darrow was behind your daughter's kidnapping and all the others. Oh, I'm going to bring that son of a bitch down. You'll be getting that pick up call anytime now. When the yell are they going to call? This waiting is driving me crazy. Honey, the pacing isn't going to help anything. Why don't you just sit down and finish your wine. This is it. I know it. - Hello. - This is the babysitter. Have you called the cops? Uh, no, no. We have not contacted the police. My wife, we have followed your every direction. You got a pen? Something to write on? Uh, yes, yes. I have a pen and paper. Now, take this down. That's it. I've got it all. Now... please do not hurt my child. Hey, pal, your daughter has been an angel. No trouble at all. In fact, because she's been so well behaved, my associate has taken special care of her. Okay, enough chitchat. Come pick up your brat. And be alone! Just a moment. I'm going to need some support through this. My oldest daughter is going to come with me. Is that okay? I need some support to get through this. Is that alright? No sweat of my ass. Bring her. But here only. You get me? Yes. Yes, I understand completely. Goodbye. Dad. It's time to call Harry. He'll know what to do. Angelo, pastrami for Harry. Okay. Shore restaurant. Chris speaking. Yeah, he's here. Hold on. Hey, big shot. You got a phone call. What am I now your answering service? You know this is a bit much. You know, what you ought to do is talk to your bosses about installing a separate line just for me. Yeah, I'll get right on that. You do that. Harry Nyte speaking. It's Anton Stromberg. Hey, Mr. Stromberg, what's up? Did you hear anything yet? I just hung up with one of the kidnappers. Okay, good, good. Where did they want you to go? Okay, you both know what to do. Now, keep the walkie-talkie open. I'll lay low back here, but if there's any sign of trouble, use this device to contact me. I'll be in there with gun in hand, okay? Okay, Harry. Good luck. The note said... go through middle. Dad, look. Flashlight. Mr. Stromberg. This is Harry, come in. Over. Mr. Stromberg, this is-- Yes, Harry. This is Anton. I read you loud and clear. Hey, what the hell is going on in there? The suspense is killing me. Over. Look, there's a lot of space to canvas here. You've got to give us time. I'll give you a call if there's any trouble. Over and out. Sis! She's gone. She's gone. - She's breathing. Dad just-- - Oh, my God! Come on. That's okay, sweetheart. We're going to get you to the car. Give me something to drink? - Great to see you Cynthia! - Who's this? Dad, Lisa, he's going to kill us. - No. - It's okay. It's Harry Nyte. He's a friend of ours. - He's here to help us. - Oh fuck! You scared the hell out of me. - Pardon my language. - It's alright, honey. With what you've been through, I understand. Okay, let's get this frightened young girl home. ♪ Look around you now ♪ ♪ Look around you now ♪ ♪ Even those innocent eyes Can see through ♪ Okay, boss. We need to talk. So, what's so important? These kidnappings got to end. - We've had it. - Oh. So, you and your goons don't like my little side activities? Well, that's too freaking bad. The snatches continue. Boss, listen to reason. Reason hell. I'm the boss. You got it? If I tell you to grab some poor sap, you do it. If I tell you to execute somebody, you do it. If I tell you to clean the toilet, you do it. And if I tell you to get up and do the Irish jig, you do it and you smile. - And that's your final word, eh? - That's my final word! Now, take these two rags and get the hell out of here. With all due respect, this is not good, Mr. Darrow. Not good. Hey. I guess there's no more bonuses coming in. Get the hell out of here. ♪ Time keeps moving on ♪ ♪ And leaves nothing... ♪ Hey, Nacky. We need to talk. You too, Charlie. My ears are always open. There's no wax in my eardrums. Yeah, okay. I'll tell you what boss, you set something up. Good. Do that. Oh, Lisa. Ezzard and I can't begin to tell you how happy we are Cynthia made it home safely. You damn straight. We've been all pins and needles since your little sister - was grabbed. - Well, it's all over now. Things can get back to normal. No, no, no, it's far from over. Look, I witnessed that ransom pickup. Now, I'm not going to rest until I put that son of a bitch away. If there's anything I can do to help, give me a call, ok? You don't know what I'm going up against. Look, I've been working soulless since 1944. Why? Because my old partner Miles Daze swallowed both barrels of sort of shotgun from a craze Nazi. Ever since then, I've been very, very cautious about using help. Nah, nah, nah. You don't want them up against. This Bobby Darrow is heavy action. Well, excuse me here, but you seem to have forgotten I am an army man. I served in Korea. Infantries. I think I've seen my fair share of action. Come on, Harry, what do you say? Let an ex-serviceman help you out. Oh, yeah, that's right. You were in the military, but... what about Ella here? What she's going to be doing? Sitting at home, twiddling her thumbs while you and I are out roaming the main streets? Well, Ella here, in case you've forgotten, is an up and coming jazz singer. She's welling the hits three nights a week at the Coach house. Anyone sitting at home twiddling their damn thumb, is it's me. Hey, I know you are all very nice about this, but... Alright, I accept your offer. Alright. Alberto Scalise and Bobby Darrow have been a thorn in side since the 1940's. I can be wrong. Now, they're powerful men, but there's got to be some way we can bring them down. Well, here, you see, it's like this. In Korea, we always centered on the enemies weakest points - before an attack. - Yes. The same applies here. Now, these two gangsters, are they good friends, or just partners in crime? Bobby snaps his fingers and Scalise just runs all over. It's always been like that. Alright, my friend. We'll use that to our advantage. We got to figure a way to get Bobby and Scalise against each other. If he's been jumping to Bobby's tune all these years, he must be harboring an itch to take his place. I think you're onto something. Yeah, hello. Who is it? Hey, hey, this is your favorite private I. Sure, my favorite pain in the ass. Listen, beatnik. I need to know the current relationship between Bobby Darrow and Alberto Scalise. Now find out all you can and pick a place to meet. - Ticket, sir? - Oh, yeah, yeah. - Enjoy the show. - Yeah, I think I will. Thanks. Let's see in what page I was hanging on again. Ah, yeah. Must we continue to meet under these unusual circumstances? Hey, you picked this place. Where the hell did you come from? Enough with the usual banter. Can't you see I'm holding my hat up to you? I'm honored. And of course, I'm going to have to make a donation to, uh, what fund is it this time? I should say, it's meeting Harry in the men's room expense fund, okay. Fair enough. There you go now. What's going on with Bobby Darrow and Alberto Scalise, if that isn't too much to ask? Word has it that Scalise is fed up Mr. Darrow. He's recruiting from within and ready to take Bobby out permanently. If you get my drift, daddio. Loud and clear my beatnik buddy. Okay. You continue to stay healthy, Ben, because I'm telling it, you got the best information on the street bar none. Bye. Hey! I've haven't seen you. Oh, my Lord! Look at you Ian. I haven't seen you in so long. You're growing up. How are you doing Connor? How have you been? - Good. - How did that math test go? - Good. - Good. Mr. Nichols we're going to have that special order ready for you - next week, okay? - Oh, wonderful. - How's your mom in there? - Yeah, very good. - Garden doing okay? - Oh, yes. You bring over some of those tomatoes, I'll give you a couple of free chops. Oh, you got a deal. Alright. Hey, it was nice to see you guys again. I got to go. I got to make somebody's order, okay. - I'll see you later. - Thank you Mr. Clinger. Oh, kids, you're so welcome. Take care. See you later. He's such a nice man, dad. Henry, read E9 about auction at Franklin Castle. They found the secret room. Those three items maybe part of it. Any ideas? Alright. Come on, Frankie, let's go. - I got to go get my stuff. - Not yet doll face. I got to make an important call. Penny, get Amy here a double bourbon, quick. She's ready to peel her skin. Here you go sweetie. This will blow your tits off. Hello, operator. Will you give me the number of local 1317? The International Longshoremen's Association. Yeah, okay, thanks. I'll wait. Hello, I'd like to speak with Danny Green. Uh, just tell him it's Frankie. His friendly neighborhood news hound. Hey, Danny, listen. This piece of information is hot off the wire. I got a reliable word that Alberto Scalise and his crew are ready to take out Bobby Darrow. Yeah, yeah, that's right. With those two stooges out of the way, you come up in the waterfront and take over. Frankie, you rat! Any heroes? Huh? I got none. News should be coming in. Earlier today, an art auction was held at the historic Franklin castle on Cleveland West side. Treasures discovered in a secret room arouse the interest of collectors from around the world. And according to reports, at times the bidding became quite intense. And now three paintings by a local unrenowned artist, but these were found among the collection of Nazi collaborator Helmut Wiedemann in a recently discovered secret room, therefore a part of history. Can I get a starting bid of... $25? Twenty five dollars. Wonderful. Do I hear $100? One hundred dollars. Excellent! Do I hear $200? Two thousand. Two thousand dollars... going once. Going twice. Sold to the gentleman on the back row. A big hand for the marvelous bidder. The mysterious bidder declined an interview and brushed our news team away. Architect and entrepreneur Peter Falkner... No, no. It's bullshit. Nobody's going to pay two thousand smackers for junk art just because it was found with some Nazi loot. I better call that owner tomorrow. Something's not right. Something's not right about that guy. Franklin Castle. How may I help you? Hello, is this Mr. Falkner, the owner? No, no. This is Prof. Gershon. I assist Mr. Falkner with the castle properties. Can I be of service? Look, I saw the auction footage on TV the other evening, and hey, listen, there's something fishy about that last buyer. Nobody, I mean nobody spends two G's on junk. When is he picking them up? To hell with this Scalise. What's on the fire? Bobby Darrow. He's got to go! What are you off your nut or something? Hey. Scalise is right. It's Bobby Darrow who's off his freaking nut. Bobby's got us running around like errand boys picking up citizens for chump change and he's taking all the money. And none of us see any bonuses coming in. Hey, will you cut that shit out with that bonus shit already? Just speaking my grievances, Jake. Just speaking my grievance. Come on guys. Scalise is right. He needs to be our new leader. And return to us our place of honor. You know what? I think we need to take Bobby - for permanent ride. - Yeah! Alright. What are we going to do about it? You got something figured out? Bobby likes Jazz. Great. I like do up. What the hell does that got to do with it? I'll tell you what. Stan Getz is playing at the Theatrical Grill. Bobby's going. He loves that type of sax. Jake's right, Nacky. Yeah, Charlie. You tell the boss that you got a backache and you need a steam bath. And you drive. Good idea my wreck friend. And I suggest that Nimbles and you go as his bodyguards. Sounds like we've got a plan. Yeah, yeah, you know what? Nimbles and I are going to hold him in the back seat, Nacky. And then what you can do is, you can turnaround and shoot the shit out of him. Oh, man! I'm liking this! I'm liking this, daddio. Well, guys, it looks like me and Charlie are in. Scalise, we're with you. But all of you are forgetting one thing. Abe Pannell. Your face? We must show respect. So we need permission from the national alliance. I say, we move now. To hell with alliance! Let's blast them and dump them... Alright, alright. Let's get real here. Scalise is right. We got to honor tradition. I agree. You call Pannell and let him know our dilemma. The Alliance controls all organized crime nationwide. Bobby Darrow is just a console here in Cleveland. So, forget about him. Okay, boys. Tomorrow is here. And we're the new order. Yes, yes, Prof. Gershon. The auction was a grand success. All those stunning artifacts brought in an incredible amount of money. Thanks to your diligent research. Yes, I remember what you told me about the detective. I'll see what I can do. Yes, uh-- Oh, professor, do you mind returning here to help me with the collection of rare books I have found in my attic? They date back to the 1800's and I'm-- Excuse me, Mr. Falkner. A gentleman wishes to see you. A Mr. Stephan Colditz representing Henry Clinger. I believe he's here to retrieve paintings won at auction. Well, of course. Please send him in. Thank you, Jarvis. Yes, Mr. Falkner. At once. Huh, professor, sorry, I must go. A visitor. We'll get together soon. Yes? Okay, goodbye. Announcing Mr. Colditz. Thank you, Jarvis. You may go. Very good, sir. Mr. Colditz, how nice to see you again. Would you like a drink? Coffee? Tea? No, thank you. But it's kind of you to ask. I'm here for the paintings. I trust they're ready. Is there anyway you could come back - in a couple of days? - Two days? Uh, the newspapers. They want photographs of the winnings. You know, because of their discovery and the secret room. - And-- - And nothing! You've had ample time for media coverage. What is the real reason you're stalling? Tell me or I'll walk out of here right now and you can kiss - your $2000 goodbye. - No, no, please. It was the professors idea to delay you. He received some... silly phone call from a local private investigator that there's something foul about the sale, you know, because of the high bid. A local private investigator questioning our integrity? - May I ask his name? - Uh, Mr. Harry Nyte. Harry Nyte! That what? Pardon me, Mr. Falkner with my anger. We had a minor run in some years back. And the name struck a sound horn. Still his pesky self, I see. However, what I said still stands. Provide the three paintings to me now. Or I'm gone. - Do I make myself clear? - No, no, please don't leave. I'm sorry I ever listened to the professor. He watches these ridicules television detective shows. He has an overactive imagination. Listen, I'll be right back. Stay where you are. Please, don't leave. Uh, may I use your telephone? Uh, certainly, of course. Yes. Falkner's getting me the paintings. But we have a problem. Seems that old nemesis Harry Nyte is in the picture. Mr. Nyte you say. The meddler saw the auction coverage on television and thinks something isn't right. Not to worry. This could play to our advantage. But how? Yes, yes, yes! I like your idea. I'll find out where Harry lives and I'll take care of everything. Here you are Mr. Colditz. I even provided a suitcase with the works carefully packed inside. Here, take a look. Very good. I bid you farewell, kind sir. Go inside. But do it slow. - Do it slow! - Okay. Wake up. Wake up! You've been out for over an hour. What the hell-- Oh, God! What the hell did you hit me for? I've never seen you before. What the hell is this all about? Here, this will make you feel better. - It's a vodka. - How does that hurt? It'll make everything better. Drink! Okay, because you explain it. Here you go. Rock a bye baby. Hello, Joe. This is Alberto Scalise. Let me speak to Abe Pannell. How can I help you? No. No. That's out of the question. Nobody speaks directly to Mr. Pannell. This is Mr. DiFaro. Now, what's on your mind? Look, we've got a problem. How so? Bobby Darrow? Wait. Wait, wait, wait. He's doing what? For how long now? This is a problem. Okay. Okay, calm down. Now, look. My people will check out what you said. And if it's kosher, you have permission from the alliance to retire Mr. Darrow. Capiche? Alright, we'll honor your decision. Boys, do some digging. Find out if it's true. Bobby Darrow has been loyal to the alliance for 25 years. Although it hurts me, I vote we give our sanction to Mr. Scalise on his demise. That will leave a gap in the Cleveland chapter. A gap which Mr. Scalise and his young rags should fill nicely. Okay, Mr. Pannell. O'Donnell and I will get right on it. Carla, bottle of and two glasses. Sit! Behave! Do not make me lose my temper. Come on. Come on. I mean, what's this all about here? Wait a minute. Schneider sent you, my landlord. Hey, I'm a few months behind rent, but you know, hey, it's happened before. I mean, he can't send people like you around. It's illegal. You tell Schneider, you know, I-- Do you really don't know who we are? Do you, Mr. Nyte? It's not Schneider. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You were the two guys at the auction. Yeah. The stooges who bought the three worthless paintings. Oh, gosh! But what the hell am I doing here? This little scenario is no déjà vu. Well, should it? Perhaps, this will help. Oh, no. Oh, no, no! Oh, no, no. It can't be. No, no. No! Oh, yes, it can my American friend. You're Hans Kesserling. But you are dead. Both of you were dead. - Killed and-- - We did not perish in that locomotive disaster. And the three paintings won at that auction are far from worthless. Siedrich, please! That's no way to talk to our esteemed guest. And speak English. Apologize Mr. Nyte. He's still a bit quick tempered. And quite dangerous in our new endeavor. What, more espionage? - Aren't you the inquisitive one? - Oh, my God! When Hans and I resided at the Franklin Castle, years ago we discovered a priceless Van Gogh. - Van Goh? - Renoir and Picasso. That were painted over by local German American artists sympathetic to the Nazi cause. They soon were put to rest. So as the secret were kept safe. - What the fu-- - Siedrich is correct, Mr. Nyte. Now that we own the art, we desperately need to get out of the country. - To go where? Shangri La? - Oh, no, no, no. Nothing that pretentious. Switzerland is more desirable for our needs. I have proper connections there willing to pay a king's ransom for the three revere paintings. Oh, so you and Siedrich will live happily ever after. How nice! It'll be nice for you as well, Mr. Nyte. Oh, how the hell do I fit in? You my friend are a relic of a past. Oh. Something obsolete from our by gone age. Oh, really? How's your business doing? No, no, no, don't answer. Allow me. It is, what's that American phrase? "Down the tubes," is it might? What's your salary in a year? Three thousand? Five thousand if you're lucky. Oh. That's no good. That's no good for the American hero who in part brought down Nazi Germany's tents to steal the plans of the atomic bomb. Look, I got my pride. And that means something to me. A hundred and fifty thousand, Harry. You'll never get another offer like that. Don't be a chump. Take the offer. - Really? - No. Just untie him to stop him. And... if I refuse to help you? Oh. You'll never leave this room alive. You don't give me much of a choice. But you know, what you say does make a lot of sense. I mean, I've been busting my ass for years. And I really don't have anything. And nobody gives two shits whether I live or die. Alright, listen. I'll accept your offer under one condition. Oh, Mr. Nyte, you're hardly in any position to-- Oh, wait, wait. Just listen, just hear me out here, okay? You might find this very interesting. I want to bring down Bobby Darrow and Alberto Scalise. Yeah, you remember those guys. The thorns in your side back in 1944. Well, guess what? They're still around. And I want to bring the sons of bitches down. Oh, yes. I do remember the trouble that Mr. Darrow caused. Alright. You have a deal. - Oh, but Harry he is-- - He's not dead. He's alive and well along with Siedrich Kohlmann. So what do we do? Well, Ezzard what did you say back the office? Concentrate on their weak points. Well, with Bobby Darrow, it is greed. Greed is it. We're going to use that to bring down not only Bobby Darrow and Scalise but also Hans and Siedrich. Uh, we're gonna... we're gonna bring them all to justice. How's that? Okay, here's what we're going to do. Greetings. Hey, how are you doing there? Do I have the pleasure of addressing Mr. Brinkman - or Mr. Dress? - No, I'm John Brinkman, sir. - How can I help you? - Well, my name's Harry Nyte. I'm a private detective and I understand recently you had visitations for a guy by the name of "Frankie the Snitch" Frankie the Snitch? I don't think so. The only male we've had recently was a Francis Clary McCain. That's who I said, Frankie the Snitch. Oh, yeah. Dumb me. I should have known. Anyway, anyway. I'm just curious. Yeah, what kind of crowd did he draw? How many people came to visit to pay their respects? Only one. A very nervous young girl. In fact, she even brought him his burial suit. Oh, but her name, her address? Anything you got. Well, the register book is right over here. You'll have to go back a few pages. Okay, thank you. Mr. Brinkman, thank you very much. - You've been a big help. - You're very welcome. Say, a man in your profession, you really should think about pre-planning. Oh, that's right. As private detectives because we're always dodging bullets and fighting the bad guys. You watch too many of those detective shows I bet. Maybe I do. I bet your favorite one is Peter Gunn. No, wrong. Johnny Staccato. Johnny Staccato. Well, at least he plays piano on a jazz night club in between battling the cauldrons. Okay, I'll keep this in mind, Mr. Brinkman. Thanks again. Okay. - Yes? - Uh, excuse me. Are you Amy Diehl? Yeah, I'm Amy. What are you another cop? Well, sort of. I'm a private one. Don't matter, Mike Hammer. I'm not telling you anything I haven't already told the police. Well, listen kid. First off, let's get something straight. I'm not one of these television private dicks or a dime store novel detective. My name is Harry Nyte and I'm the real thing. Oh, oh, I'm really impressed. What the hell do you want? Well, let's just say I was a business acquaintance of your former lover Frankie the Snitch. And I know he always carried a black book around with him in his suit coat. Now, when the cops come in, they didn't find anything in his suit coat. It was wrapped around you when they walked in the bar. So, are you saying that I withheld information - from the police? - Uh, I'm not saying anything. Listen, you're smart enough to realize the cops ain't going to shell out any gators for that black book. So, I think you got it. And you're planning on holding out for the highest bidder, and that's ok. I wish you all the luck in the world. I just want to take a quick peek inside. Okay by you? Well, a quick peek would cost you money. But then again, I'm not really giving out peeks. If you want the book, you'll have to pay me for the entire thing. - Got it? - I knew you'd be a hard case. Alright, I'll give you five bucks Five bucks! You better start upping the ante. Look, honey, I'm not made of money. I'll go with ten spot and that stops. Double or nothing. Twenty freaking bucks! I'm not buying the high level bridge downtown. - I'll tell you what. - What? You throw in an extra ten spot and I'll make you feel real good. Oh! Well, that might change the situation a little. I've been under a slot of stress lately and... the rest and relaxation you're offering just might do the trick. No pun intended. Alright, Amy. You got a deal. Alright, listen. The name of Walter "The Wizard" Schelnick better be in that black book, or this deal is off, you got it? Okay. Now, come on in and I'll take you on a trip - around the world - Let's let the tour begin. This is Walter. Can I help you? Yeah, you can help. This is your old pal Harry Nyte, remember? Harry Nyte! You really are a good detective tracing down this number to my new employer. But you make it sound like I'm a criminal. Hey, who are you trying to kid my friend? You're the underworld's favorite forger. What do you need Mr. Nyte? Three passports. One for myself and two associates under assumed names. Oh, and this is under the hat. You got that Mr. Wizard? Okay, I'll be glad to help you, but it's going to cost you 1500 for all three. Fifteen hundred clam! You freaking bandit! Well, alright, alright. We'll pay the tariff. Be here at my place tonight. I need to take your pictures and the passports will be ready the next day. Is that soon enough for you, Mr. Nyte? They don't call you Walter the Wizard for nothing. Okay, my friend. I'll phone my associates and you can expect us tonight. So, get that camera ready. Asshole. Hello, this is Harry Nyte. Oh, Mr. Nyte, I'm so glad I caught you in. I've made an interesting discovery. Further investigation into the secret room enabled me to unfold yet another hidden panel on the wall. Well, it contain the dairy of Helmut Wiedemann. among other things. And in the dairy he talks about the three paintings. And just what did he have to say about them? The really are famous works of art. Painted my Van Gogh, Picasso and Renoir. I mean, can you imagine that? Well, no wonder that Henry Clinger wanted those landscape so badly. The originals were painted over by local German artist. Well, I say about 1943. Well, there're painted that would make them worthless. Well, what should we do? I'm going to call the police. No, no, no, no, don't do that. Look, I told you there was something fishy about that guy and working up an investigation. This info was priceless, but please leave the police out of this, at least until my investigation is over, okay professor? Well, alright. Well, if you're onto something alright. I'll keep quite until you tell me do otherwise. Thank you. Thank you, professor. Look, give me a couple of days, and I'll phone you and explain my findings on this Henry Clinger. Thank you. Thank you, professor. Yeah, goodbye. Goodbye. Fretz? The phone. This is Henry. Well, it's me. Hey, we got trouble pal. Prof. Gershon found a diary written by Helmut Wiedemann exposing all the going under the castle-- - Mr. Nyte-- - painting of a masterwork. - Mr. Nyte-- - Look, I was able to stall him - from the cops. Maybe-- - Mr. Nyte! What? Harry. You worry too much. Relax. Relax, my friend. Don't worry. I'll handle the problem. But... just leave everything to me, alright? Okay. If you want a word, there's no sweat off my brow. Hey, I'm going to get cleaned up. Yeah, I think I'll get a new suit, new shirt, new tie. Hey-- We got a call from Dorothy Fulham this afternoon. Really? She wanted to know if you'd free this Thursday to appear on the 1 o'clock club, you know. I think she has to every single day. Huh, I don't think I can do that. But, that's you can't do the show at all, or you just can't do it on Thursday? Not this Thursday. Well, I can tell-- How did you get in here? Where's Jarvis? He's resting peacefully. The time has come gentlemen for... Stefan and myself to reveal our true identities. Much like that television game show To Tell the Truth, although Bud Collyer will not be joining us as MC. Why? Why gentlemen did you have to discover that damn diary from Helmut Wiedemann? Naughty boys. Siedrich, teach these naughty boys a lesson. Gentlemen, I dearly hope you have enjoyed yourself. Bid you a... farewell. Up. Up. Shit! Well, well, well. Another one of Harry Nyte's associates. Now you do have the money for the passports, don't you? Count it. I insist. You bet I will. You take a look at these. Your photo came out exceptionally well, you hepcat. Sorry my friend. Must tie up loose ends. American weapons! Oh, yes. Oh, that stack will do me nicely. Oh, come on, it's not that bad. So sorry my friend. I hope you don't mind. My gun jammed. But don't lose your head over it. Mr. Darrow, Nimbles and I would be absolutely thrilled and honored to join you at the Theatrical Grill. Well. Well, it's about time he starts to show a little respect. Come on, let's go. I got to see Stan Getz. Hey, boss, remember, seize the day. You know, Mr. Darrow, I hear that Stan Getz, hits all the right notes on the tenor saxophone. So when did you learn how to learn appreciate music? Actually, I don't appreciate music at all. But I do know another guy who hits all the right notes with his 38 caliber revolver. - And he plays solo too. - Nacky! Now's the time. Hey, boss. I have always been loyal to you and always will be. And by the way, Abe Pannell gave Scalise the okay. Well, Nacky, we'll deal with Abe Pannell later. But right now, go around back ang get me another car so I don't miss the show. And then go back inside and get rid of that piece of garbage. Okay, boss. Four aces. You lousy prick. You win the next time, I'm gonna cut your dick off. Regards from Bobby. Oh, my Lord! Yes? Let me speak to Bobby. This is Bobby. Alright, alright. Quit kidding around. This is Bobby. Now what the hell do you want? Okay, if you're Bobby, and you've either been kicked in the golden age, or you had one of those Christine Jorgensen sex change operation. Hey, wait a minute. This is Bobby. Bobby Lyn Skeets, Bobby Darrow's girlfriend. Oh, Bobby Lyn Skeets. How sweet! I can hear him coming out of the shower now. Who should I say is calling? Tell him it's the gumshoe he still loves to hate. Hon, the phone's for you. Some gummy bear. I don't know. Hello, this is Mr. Darrow. Who the hell is this? Bobby Darrow, it's been years. But you leave such an impression on people. It's hard to forget you. It's Harry Nyte the gumshoe. Oh, my God! You're still doing that shameless routine? You're just a piece of shit that won't evaporate. Yes, Mr. D. And I'm also a piece of shit that you don't want to step into. You know, you make me laugh, gumshoe. Still trying to play that old time tough guy. This is 1961, and things have changed. What the hell you want to talk about to me? Do you recall a character back in 1944 named Hans Kesserling? Yeah, what about him? That Nazi bastard and his pal were killed in a train crash about... 16 years ago. Not so. Both them made a break after the crash and they've been laying low all these years until now. Stop beating around the bush. What the hell's on your mind? Remember how Franklin Castle was a resting place for Nazi spies and also a storage house for stolen art work, you know, back in the 40's? Well, the new owner Peter Falkner had an auction recently. I'm sure you heard. An odd auction. But this mysterious gentleman shows up and makes an obscure bid of two G's for three insignificant landscapes. - And he won. - Let me guess. The asshole that bought those paintings was Hans the kraut. Yes, Henry Clinger is Hans Kesserling. And he's back in town with Siedrich Kohlmann. That kraut caused me a lot of money when that atom bomb deal fell through. Those three worthless paintings he purchased, they have something underneath. Like, three priceless works of art. Hey, these are worth millions. Alright. Alright. That's what I like to hear. But what's your angle? Hey, look Bobby, I'm no kid anymore. I don't have the moxie to go against the Nazi but you do. I'll tell you what, for a fee of $500, I'll give you the lowdown of where that son of a bitch is staying. All you have to do is take one of your boys, bust in, and grab what he has. I like what you're saying, Mr. Nyte. The 500 is yours. But the information better be on the level. I got it. Will you sit down. I said I got it. - Hello. - It's Harry. Our boy Bobby Darrow, he went for it. Hook, line, and sinker. As I suspected, Mr. Nyte. Good. Okay, fill me in when you have all the details. - What's the plan? - Harry and Mr. Ezzard will be in the car watching the Marlowe apartments. I've arranged to use a flat there on the top floor. Well, Ezzard, I don't like to cut my chickens before they hatch, but we have succeeded in getting Bobby Darrow and Nacky Gant rushing to the Marlowe apartments. Buy one box of 38 caliber blank ammo. Blanks? What the hell for? Oh, it's just a whimsical fault of mine. Something to toy with our American friends. Yeah. - All the rats in one cage. - You got it. At the appropriate time, you will exchange live ammunition for the blank cartridges. Oh, Siedrich, I do indeed have such fun instore for our friends. But Ezzard. I don't know. This whole plan could blow up in our faces. I don't know, Harry. It's a win-win situation. With Scalise out of the way, and Bobby D and his new crew in the same room with us, oh hell, that apartment will explode! Siedrich, Siedrich, soon we will be out of this God forsaken country and I will be so rich. Oh! So now you will be rich? Have you forgotten about me? Siedrich! I apologize my friend. It was just a slip of the tongue. Of course, I mean, we will be wealthy beyond our dreams, absolutely. Come on, Harry. Let's drive now to the Marlowe and watch the fireworks. Sounds good. Let's go. It is the first thing Harry has ever done wrong in his miserable life and it will haunt him forever. He just hasn't realized that yet. Hey, Bobby. Why'd you have me borrow my brother's car? We could be driving those saber or your Fleetwood caddy. This is embarrassing. Oh, man! It's Nacky Gant and Bobby D. Nacky. Let me ask you something. What are we doing here? Simple. We're going to kill a couple of Nazi's, - and steal some artwork. - Right. So how would it look if we step up with a car that stands out like a sore thumb? - Get it? - Got it. Good. Boss, you're always one step ahead. That's why I'm the boss. Okay, let's get this over with. - Shall we? - We shall. Okay, Mr. Gant, are you ready to meet our fugitive friends? - I'm right here, boss. - Me too. Oh, this is going to fun. You know, they're never going to expect us. Come on, let's go. Okay, Ezzard, I'm going in, but here's the thing, I'm going to need 20 minutes. Now listen, if I'm not up by that time, come running up with your gun and kick the door down if you have to, but I need 20 minutes. I don't care what you hear, see, or whatever. Give me 20 minutes, alright? Alright, Harry. It's your party. It's against my better judgement, but if you need 20 minutes, - I'll give you that time. - Okay, I appreciate it buddy. - Wish me luck. - Hey, Harry. - What? What? - I wish you luck. Oh, you're a funny guy. Hands up! What's all this kinder spill? Gentlemen, please, release Mrs. Shiva and her son at once. Thank you. Now, this way gentlemen, please. I insist. Hands up! Welcome gentlemen. We've been expecting you. Please go inside. Make yourself comfortable. And I will deal with the distraught tenant. Who the hell are you? And who are those thugs? And where is Louis Hersh? He disappeared days ago and how you occupy - his apartment? - Mrs. Shiva. Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Mr. Hersh's cousin, Herald Kiser. He doesn't have a cousin. He doesn't have, oh. I beg your pardon, Mrs. Shiva. I'm not surprised you think that. Always with the lies, Louise's. - Don't you come any closer. - Please. Let me explain. As I said, Louise is my cousin. But he's also the degenerate gambler. In fact, that scruffy rabble that went into the apartment, they're gamblers as well. And they're here to collect a debt. I told Louise being the weakling that he is, take a vacation, go visit a friend, something. Just leave. And I will occupy his apartment, deal with the gamblers myself when they arrive. Now, don't you think that is noble of me Mrs. Shiva? - Mom, he seems okay to me. - Jacob... it's for me to determine. Guns and gambling in my building. I won't stand for it. No, son. You let mother handle this. I'm going to call the police. My dear lady. My dear. Literally. You fucking Jew. Now, to the left! Put your guns down on the table. Now, take your top coats off and throw them on the floor. Good boys. Now, take off your jackets. You American gangsters have a fondness for your shoulder holsters. I must be certain. Do it now. Sit. Keep your hands to your side. So, uh, you and Hans planning on selling this art work overseas, huh? What's your cut? We are equal partners is it's any concern of yours. You think that slick son of a bitch is going to split any of the gears with the likes of you? Come on, Siedrich. You know you're just his stooge. He's just using you now. I guarantee you, after the sale, your days are numbered. Shut up! You're only saying that because of the position you're in now. Hans and I are the remaining seed of a master race. - We would die for each other. - Maybe you for him. But not the other way around. Just... just remember what we said. So, where were we? Oh, excuse me gentlemen. Do you really think that crazy son of a bitch is going to split millions of dollars with you? Quiet! Or I'll cut both of you. So? Did you really think that you can just come up here and take these master works from me? You can't even make an attempt to buy them. Oh. I would really love to know who tipped you off to my newly acquired possessions. Does it really matter now, does it? The only thing on my mind is how rich I'm going to be when these paintings are sold in Switzerland. You mean... How rich the both of you are going to be? Of course. It was just a figure of speech. Don't change the subject. Siedrich, get those weapons out of my sight. Take them into the kitchen. And stop speaking German. Yes, my master. So, now it's time to change the real to the fake. Hans, Hans, Hans, you nasty devil. Alright, main hair. What are you planning on doing with us? Oh, that is an excellent question, Mr. Gant. Well, if it isn't a Harry Nyte. Join us. Oh. My, my, my! Well, if it isn't my old nemesis Mr. Harry Nyte. Oh please, join us. Yes, Siedrich, take that into the kitchen with the others. Harry, Harry, Harry. Here we go. Well, isn't this nice? What a lovely party this has turned out to be. Well, it's obvious now who informed you about the art, and my whereabouts. Oh, I beg your pardon. Our whereabouts, isn't that right gentlemen? Be careful with what you say. Never know who's listening. Hey, I'm sorry Bobby. I really thought you'd get the drop on these two guys. No. Do you know that he was expecting us? Gentlemen, gentlemen, it doesn't matter who said what to who. What matters now is we're all together. So let's just try to make the best of it, shall we? So, what're you going to do now butcher boy? You're going to kill us all? Ah! But seeing that I'm sporting man, how about we all play a little game? A little game, huh? How about the shoots and ladders? Monopoly? Mini Park's easy. Siedrich. Bring the guns back in. Oh, much better, Mr. Gant. Much, much better. What do you want with these? Give them back. Now, you got my curiosity aroused. This my friends will be a game of winner take all. Oh, it's a simple game gentlemen. We all have a weapon at the ready. Next. I will engage this timer. And then we place our hands at our sides. When the timer goes off... Well... last one left alive wins the artwork. What about Elmer Fudd over there? Oh, he'll do as he's told. Um, Siedrich, if by chance any of these men shall kill me, give it to them. Do you understand? Yes, yes, I understand. Like we can really trust that guy. Well, I'm sorry boys. It's the only game in town. So, shall we play? If it's the only way to put a few slugs in this guy, then let's do it. Charming. Who's the fool now, Harry? What the hell did you do? All the plans. You ruined everything. I've ruined nothing, my meddling friend. No more kissing the ass of this condescending prick. All his snapping his fingers, Siedrich do this, Siedrich do that like I'm some kind of fucking puppy. But why did you put blanks in my gun? I Guess I'm not as dumb as you thought Harry. I knew the gangsters will be blasting at Hans. But you, I thought that you would attempt to kill me, so only two would share the wealth. Ah, you stupid Shylock. I fooled everyone. Yeah, you're one surprisingly smart son of a bitch. I suppose you wish me alive just to gloat over this moment, huh? You're so right, asshole. But now it's time for you to join your friends. So sorry. Hans, what the hell man! What the hell! Siedrich. He betrayed me. Why? - I would have never cut him out. - Okay, okay, it's alright. He was my friend. My loyal friend. Breathe easy. Breathe easy. Listen, tell me please, where is the real artwork? - The artwork? - Suitcase. - Brown suitcase. I don't know. - Okay, hang in there. Hang in there. I'll be right back. Hang in there. Alright. Come on. Come on, come on. Mother. Hans, Hans, please, please don't die. Don't die my friend. The suitcase is empty. There's nothing in there. Please tell me where the artwork is. Please don't die. The artwork is... Don't die like those pigs. - Tell me. - It's... It's in the... Harry... You must go. - The art's... - That's right. - It's in the... - Yeah. - It's in? - It's... It's in? It's in? It's in? It's in? It's in... No. No. No. Oh! You're all a son of a bitch. You... You bastard! You rotten son of a bitch! Son of a bitch! Alright. The hell with your 20 minutes Harry. I'm coming in. Oh, my God! What the hell! No doubt, it's the final goodbye for these chumps. Harry, are you okay? Peachy keen. Just... peachy keen. Wow Harry! You did it. You got the Nazi's, the hoods and the goods. Don't count your chickens. Take a good look at those paintings. Look at the backs... Harry... these are reproductions from the Halle Brother company. Two ninety nine. The price tags are still on them. What the hell is going on? Where are the real ones? The only two people who know that are right there. What did you call this, "The final goodbye"? Alright, you can forget... any rewards. You can say goodbye to them too. Oh hell! Even without the goods, you still got to have a shootout with two Nazi war criminals. And you got Bobby Darrow and Nacky Gant blasted away. Cheer up man! You're going to be a hero again. Just like 1944. Don't worry about it. The paintings will turn up - sooner or later. - Listen, I know Hans Kesserling. Those pictures are hidden away where nobody's going to find them. No, it's over with. It's all over. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Now, you got the real lowdown on what happened that night at 1961. And sure the bullshit I told the media stood up just fine. Even Ezzard never knew the complete story. And after all these years, plus the $500 incentive, you decided to come clean? Well, Harry, I don't mind telling you. I'm quite disappointed in your choice to team up with Hans Kesserling. The man who killed your partner. And all for a lousy dollar. Dave, I don't blame you. It haunts me every freaking day of my miserable life. I deserve to be miserable. That's what happens when you make a deal with the devil. And Hans was the devil incarnate. Look, Harry. I got enough here on tape. Without a doubt we will run a story at News 11 about the "Final goodbye." And all your... dastardly deeds. Here you go. Five hundred. Keep it. Keep it. I don't want to see a penny of it. Just recalling all this stuff has made me feel like shit. That's your choice, Harry. Besides I really think you could use the money. What are you talking about? This old flatty ain't finished yet. I'll have a client any day now. Oh, yes. Your new combination home office will have them lining up around the block. It's been a very interesting day, Harry. Thank you. - I'll be in touch. - Thanks for coming by, Dave. You're welcome. Come on, Harry. I know you're in there. I saw that reporter leaving in his TV truck. - Open up! - Oh, you Schneider, Schneider. Let me guess. You want to hire me for a job? I wouldn't hire you to walk my dog, you lousy bum. If it ain't for a job, what could you possibly want? The last three months' rent. You freaking deadbeat! Deadbeat always pays his rent, uh, eventually. Look, I've got a client coming in, really, honestly. Got a client. Uh, just give me until the end of the week, okay? Come on, what do you say? You got three days, Harry. Or I'll be here with the authorities to evict your ass. Someday I just got to change these surroundings. Fourteen years I've lived here. Other than this table, everything is the same. Same furniture. Same paintings. Who am I kidding? I can't even change a damn thing. All I can think about day in and day out is what happened to those three paintings. Where could that Nazi bastard have stashed them? He just had to die. Had to died before he could tell me. Damn it all! Son of a bitch! Oh, God! Oh, who am I kidding? Who am I kidding? I just can't face this. It's all over. Hell with it. Hell with it! Oh! I can't do it. One... What the hell just happened?
