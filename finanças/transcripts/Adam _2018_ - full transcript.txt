What child has not had reason to weep over its parents? - Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche If you were me, you would probably now say that life sucks. Then you would maybe call someone and get it off your chest. I would love to throw a window open and scream 'Fuck you' as loud as possible. I'm just a normal guy who wants a normal life. At this moment that's not an option. My mom was OK. Made cool music. Dreamt of becoming famous. There were a lot of parties. Lots of alcohol. Drugs, clubs. At some point she couldn't take it anymore and wound up in the looney bin. Again, and again. "After a party, there's always a little hangover", she liked to say. She said a lot of things like that, my mom. One of her favourites was: "You have to celebrate life as long as you can." Hi! Do you speak English? You said on tinder, you would speak English and you would be twenty five. You are non of that, no? I don’t understand, is this your teenage fantasy game? Or what is this? I really don't like this, you know. I think I'm going, okay... Thank you for the date. If you don't say anything... You're making me nervous! Say something! Okay, Adam... Oh, you cannot hear? I'm sorry! I'm so sorry! I'm really sorry! I made fun of you! I didn't want to. I'm sorry. No, I can not. I'm pregnant. Wow. Thank you. I'm really really sorry. Sorry. Find someone your own age! I like mature women! But when are you coming back? Maybe I'll stay here forever. New Zealand is cool. Always warm. Damn heat! You're just jealous! And when is your mom getting back? Soon. Boy, turn the music off! Too loud! You visit her already? I can't go there, dude. You're responsible for her. - And you? I'm just the manager. Do I have to? I brought your birthday present. Your mom made that for you last time we were together. The final trip. It was your birthday recently, right? Damn pop industry. It really destroyed her, that techno shit. What does it say? Can I read it? "Promise me, always be nice to the girls. Not an asshole like your dad." What does it say? "Love." Didn't know she could be so sentimental! "Promise me you'll always be yourself!" What does the last one say? "Number three: Promise me that you'll not forget to... ...kill me... ...if I ever go crazy and they want to lock me away, like Granny." My mom had actually made me promise ... to kill her... ...if she ever ended up like my grandma. Something stopped working in grandma's head ... ... and she had to be institutionalized. It took her years to die. Excuse me! Are you by any chance Adam Schwanbeck? Your mother has Korsakoff-Syndrome. Do you know what that is? You don't? Korsakoff is placed in the International Classification of Diseases under ICC 10... F10.6 It's irreversible... It's irreversible. She won't improve. There's no cure... worst form of brain damage... ...from alcohol abuse. My mother was a good singer. Oh, she was a good singer? Great! We terminated the lease on the apartment. You've got three months to leave the apartment. Do you have any family? Grandparents? All dead? I'm sorry. And your father? Are you in touch with him maybe? No? You don't know him? Adam, you do realize that your mom's not coming back, right? That's clear? Mom's not coming back. She stays in the nursing home. You understand? Irreversible... Like I already explained. Hello! How are you? Warm. I sing so well. Nobody knew I could sing so well. Me neither. Not even Susanne. ... take my mother home and care for her myself. Yours sincerely, Adam Schwanbeck" It was a love at first sight when my parents first met. They were both high on Ecstasy. They danced for two days straight in club E-Werk, totally in love. Then they fucked for three days... ... he gave her his photo ... ... and then it was over. My father was just too square after all, she said. Paul van Dyk was dj-ing the night my parents met. My mom was obsessed with him. Just recently Paul van Dyk fell off the stage... ...and broke his neck. Fräulein! Two steaks with fries. What a lovely day! Your high school diploma. It's not really something to brag about. You get me? So you'll just have to start with smaller jobs, you can earn money with that, good money. I've written some down... You could for example, without any trouble, stock groceries in a supermarket. Be a warehouse worker ... ... or here for example in the restaurant ... ... you could clean tables, help with the dishes in the kitchen. And? Did she say anything? Didn't say a thing? Nothing at all? - What? About me? She can't remember me? Stop teasing me! "You are not allowed to tell!" What did she say? Hi Adam! I found your father. He would really like to meet you. Why? He was never interested in me. He says that's not true. Your mom kept him away. She only let him send you birthday cards. "My dear Adam..." This is where I live. Wanna come up? Adam... I would like to apologize for last time. I spoke too fast. I thought about it afterwards... You have to read my lips. So now I will speak a lot slower. Okay? Good! I HAVE TO SWITCH MY GLASSES. Reading glasses. Adam, you sent a plea to the board of the hospital... in which you ask to take care of your mother at home. We looked through it and evaluated... WE EVALUATED IT... AND LOOKED AT YOUR CASE... and... Professor Dr. Falkenstein that's the head... That's the director of the hospital. He vetoed it. Why? It's impossible, we can't do it. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE, WE CAN'T DO IT... your mother is too sick... and the degree of care she needs at home, 24 hours... far exceeds what you can provide... and it would be too expensive to pay for her care at home. There is nothing we can do. I'm sorry. They would be delighted to get to know you. You mean, if you and your mother can move in with us? I'm afraid not. You're lying! I want to go home. I want to go home... - You cannot go home. You are home. Susanne? Susanne? Are you there? Susanne, are you upstairs? I want to go home. I want to go home... I don't know this place. I want to go home. I want to go home... - HEY! SHUSH! You left the door wide open! What is going on? - You can't go to Osterholz! Osterholz far away! Erle! What are you doing home? You are home. Everything is ok. Don't you notice the door is open? I WANT TO GO HOME! Did you bring her here? Goddammit, are you allowed to do that? Man! Adam! I want to go home. I want to go home... You are home. I WANT TO GO HOME! It's OK! Backyard, 1st floor. The door is open. The ambulance is here. "Promise me that you'll not forget to kill me... if I ever get crazy in the head and locked away like Granny." Somebody tells me: "I want to die". How should I react? Euthanasia is strictly forbidden in Germany. Painkillers can be deadly. Is it possible to buy Kaliumchloride? - Add to cart - - Buy - It worked out! I'm on the rugby team, haha! You wanted to do that, right? Some girl again? It's not worth it to suffer because of a girl! There are so many! In New Zealand they throw themselves at you! What's wrong? Something wrong? She walked to this pond. And suddenly she heard a "Blub". And she was like: What was that? She wanted to walk further... But she thought: I'm gonna check this out. She went to the water she checked it out.... And there was a baby! You know, a real baby in the water! And she got in, took out the baby... and it was living! a real, real baby! That was left there! Are you okay? Are you okay? Are you sure? You want to sit here? I think I don’t like this. Adam! Adam! Adam! She eventually stopped crying. She still wants to go home sometimes. Home to Osterholz to her sister Susanne. But her sister lives in Ibiza. I read somewhere that each day around 250 000 people die in the world. We all suffer from a deadly disease. It's called mortality. The death rate from mortality is still one hundred percent.
