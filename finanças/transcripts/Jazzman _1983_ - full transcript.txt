MOSFILM Art for People! Is he the one who played during recess yesterday? Stand up, defendant. Come closer. I now give the floor to comrade Bukin, a student of the composition department. I present two charges against student Ivanov: first, decadence, and, second, he is popularizing a monstrous product of bourgeois culture, namely, jazz. Can you say something in your defence? I can. Did you know that the sociaI roots ofjazz go deep into Negro folk songs, the blues? And that the Negroes are the most disinherited and oppressed people in the United States? Their music cannot, therefore, be called bourgeois. It's progressive and revolutionary! Enough oration! Answer the charges. You have proletarian roots and have sunk... ...to being an agent of world imperialism! - Gone too far! - No! He should be expelled from our music schooI. Instead of expelling Ivanov I think we ought to reprimand him and forbid him to play - Jazz! - ... jazz! I want to say this: I won't give up jazz!

You'll now see and hear the popular stage duet, en route to Monte Carlo, Harry Soldy and Billy Moldy! Count Tolstoy once said that man's life is a straight railroad line. My suitcase stands by the window. Well, pick it up, and fast! I won't pick it up! Esteemed citizens of Odessa, we'll be gratefuI for every token of your appreciation! Many thanks! Same to you. Play it right or I'll slug you! I'm touched, friends. Thank you, madam. Stop. The show's over. Is Chamberlain going to attack us? - He won't dare. - But what if he does? Just let him try. We'll work him so bad his own mother won't know him. There's Katya. Why, if it isn't Stepan and Zhora! I heard... ...you both died of typhus. We've been out of work for 3 months. What about you? I'm in the Higiene Choir. What kind of outfit is that? It's from education department. - How much do they pay? - Not a kopek. But I get free meals plus free soap once a month. Could you get Zhora and me into it? No, it's a women's choir. Well, I gotta see a man about an engagement. Look at the mutt, Stepan. Isn't he cute? Poor darling, motherless and fatherless. I'd rather look at a 15 kopek coin. Let's adopt him. What for? When we come home in the evening, all tired out, he'll cheer us up. Oh, forget it. A job's the only thing that can cheer me up. Let's go to the employment agency. Come here! Look! Musicians wanted! Banjo and drums. For a jazz band. What's that? Haven't the faintest. Well, that's jazz. - Like it? - Yes, a lot. - What about you? - He likes it too. We still need a saxophone, but us three can start. Did you catch what makes jazz so speciaI? - Of course. - The syncopation. Yes, the syncopation. Remember the instrument that sounds like this? Think it was a trumpet? Well, it was a trumpet, but with a mute. We're in great luck, friends. We'll be the first jazz band in the republic. We'll see no end of success! We'll play in the best halls in the country. We've settled everything. We rehearse tomorrow morning, and in the evening we play. He's a crackpot. - You think so? - You saw that, didn't you? - What do we do? - Forget the whole thing. - But we might become famous. - Never. But suppose we do? Get off the stage! Scram! Cheaters! Kick 'em out! Call that music? We never should have hooked up with you! We had our own program. We weren't stars, but we made a living. But now you're obsessed with fame, eh. Did you think we'd become stars overnight? Nothing new ever wins recognition at first. We went in too much for sound effects. We haven't learned to play well yet. We've still got a lot of hard work ahead of us. We've wasted enough time. Let's rehearse. You an idiot, or what? To hell with yourjazz and your rehearsals! Snap out of it! Let's go. Wait! What about our band? You can take your band and... I'll knock you silly! - Greetings, boys. - Well, what is it? I've been wanting to meet you a long time. Could you play for us at a party tomorrow evening? I know just how you feeI. - Will 600 rubles be enough? - How much did you say? 600 rubles. Here's an advance. Tomorrow evenings at 7. The Paradise Restaurant. Let the boys take a breather. You didn't think anybody wanted jazz. What intelligent audience, right, Stepan? I always said jazz has a big future. Our next number is dedicated to the hero of the day. Papa invites you to join him at his table. Friends, I want to thank all of you for the surprise you arranged on my birthday by inviting these fine young men here. As you know, I have few weaknesses. Jazz is one of them. I love jazz. I first began to appreciate jazz in Chicago in 1908 when I heard Mitchell. How he played! He held the audience spellbound. They forget everything else in the world. That was ideaI for my work. I wish the Soviet pioneers ofjazz every success because their success is our success. Any more birthdays coming up? We could play more. Papa is the only one of us who's crazy about jazz. None of the boys care for it. Ever hear Sam Wooding? Sam holds a speciaI place in my heart. - What about Scott Joplin? - Scott is vulgar. Very few well to do people used to go to hear him. Scott Joplin is my ideaI. Especially this number. Know this one? Of course. 'Alexander's Ragtime Band'. Friends and associates, we have gathered here today for the golden anniversary of Papa's working career. I have the honour to convey heartiest greetings to Papa from the staff of the Taganrog branch and to present him with this small token of our affection. Is that your idea of a joke? How'd I know it was for Papa? You jerk! What'd you call me? Pile in, boys! I like Duke Ellington best of all. Time to pack it up, Papa. It's my bedtime, but you youngsters can stay on. Enjoy yourselves while you're young. Nobody move! 579... It's all in small bills! Don't worry, Kostya. They'II let us out soon. What a disgrace! We played for a gang of crooks. I say we ought to give this money to the government. What for? It's stolen money. I have a better idea. Let's just keep it. Who's in favor? Two against one. I'll turn in my share. - Where am I? - In Monte Carlo. - No, where am I? - In jaiI. I can see that. - But what city am I in? - Yesterday it was Odessa. Wise guys, huh? You crooks? - We're musicians. - Yeah, sure. Who the hell are you? A musician. A reaI one. When you were still knee high to a grasshopper I was playing in a regimentaI brass band. I was the first saxophone. You're a saxophone player? Friends, this is a big day for us. Today ourjazz band is born. Now that this fine musician, Ivan Bavurin, has joined us, we're a reaI jazz group. Boundless horizons open up before us. Now we can tackle complicated jazz pieces and play in the best places. Farewell, farewell, Odessa, mother mine, A place I'II love for ever more! I'll not forget the Black Sea's rising waves, I'll not forget them striking at your shore. You hummed with life, Odessa, mother mine; My youth passed here, but now it's gone. Farewell, farewell, Odessa, mother mine, Please give your blessing to your gratefuI son. Entrance hall, bathroom, lounge, two bedrooms and a balcony. Not bad. Not bad at all. When we were in Tsarskoye Selo... Oh, shut up! Where's the best place in town for music? We're a jazz band and we'll be playing here in Moscow. The Hermitage Garden is the best place for that. We won't make it in Moscow. Coming here... ...was a mistake. Did you see his drums? - Did you hear them play? - I didn't like it. When we played, the Tsar himself used to... Shut up - you and your Tsar! What do they make? 25 a man? More like 100. Even the Gypsies don't make that much. All you talk about is money. When we develop our own style we'll each be getting 200. The main thing is to work out our own style. RehearsaI at10 a. m. tomorrow. - Why not 9? - Good. Make it 9. - What's the matter? - That was a bad start. The way to start, eh. The opening bars greet our audience. The people out there are old friends of ours. When you meet a friend you don't yell at him. Or did you think the louder the better? A band shouldn't puff like a steam engine. The drummer played the first five bars very well, but after that he was lousy. The best band is a quiet band. Now the saxophone. When you take a solo you got to improvise, but you keep to the score. I play exactly by music. Follow orders or I'll fire you, you bourgeois lackey! - What? - Nothing. Watch your language before I make you feeI sorry. When the Tsar gave up the throne I was the first to play the 'Marseillaise'. Stop it! Let's rehearse. Jacobin! From this mark, okay? Ready! Don't follow the score. Improvise. - That's what I'm doing. - You play by music. Through improvisation you express your inner self. Your inner self! Why didn't you say so, instead of shouting? Once more. Well? - Listen, you aristocrat! - Sit down, Stepan. Now listen, Ivan. Listen. There's the saxophone. Hear that? That's a reaI solo. See the point? You dumbbell! That's enough for today. What do they want, Zhora? Are you really so dumb or are you pretending? O Lord! Improvisation, pah! Whoever thought up improvisation? The Germans, probably. They invent things, and we Russians pay for it. Well, I'll express my inner self. - We ought to kick Ivan out. - Where'll we find a sax man? I'd never treat him with kid gloves like you do. I'd teach him quick how to express himself. Why do you yell at him? You don't know this sort. Got to treat 'em rough. - Gimme a match. - I don't smoke. Your daily allowance, Zhora. Next. Your name? Okay, go ahead. Ivan Bavurin. 73 kopeks. But that's a ruble short. What about the ruble? You were fined 1 ruble for not doing yourjob properly. We'll keep on fining you. This is robbery. I'll complain. Go right ahead. You can take us to court if you want to. You'll turn me into a beggar. It's sinfuI. That's what we need. Just look at this! 'A prize bull was brought to the agriculturai fair... ' No, the item below. 'The popular Cuban singer Clementina Fernandez 'is now in Leningrad. 'She will arrive in Moscow tomorrow. ' - Got it? - No, I don't. Clementina Fernandez! One of the world's most famous jazz singers. If we could only get her to sing with us! We'll outstrip all of them. Take this and buy fruit and champagne. The top's too tight. It'll do. What will do? Don't lean against anything. We got to return these outfits at six o'clock. - What about me? - Take a day off. I see: we share the work but not the fun. Here's a ruble for beer. Hurry up, Kostya, we still have to go for the interpreter. - An interpreter? What for? - You gonna translate? - I can handle it. - You know languages? Didn't I live at court for10 years? Let's hear you say something. - What does that mean? - Would you like a cup of tea, miss? I'm ready. Let's go. There she is! Welcome to our capitaI. He's Kostya, he's Stepan, and I'm Ivan Bavurin. - Some pivo, as we call it? - Pivo? What's that? Well, it's - you know. - Good! - It's sure is. Waiting is dull. Bring us some snacks, Stepan. - One more? - No, that's enough. - But we will, won't we? - Absolutely. Grand Duke Konstantin once sent 4 magnums of champagne to us in the barracks. Here's to you. There was another funny story... Come on! - I've had enough. - It's your duty. - Let's get down to the contract. - Too early. No, too early. Get some more champagne, Zhora. - How many? - Get three bottles. For us not to go away for more. No, better make it five. There he is! We searched for you all night. - Where were you? - Here, sleeping. I told you so, but you said, 'No, he went to the Gypsies'. Join us. Have some tea. Is everything OK? Somebody stole my last ten ruble bill. The Gypsies, probably. Where'd they come from? - You called them. - I? When the Gypsies started singing you shouted. Did Clementina sign the contract? But you said we didn't need her. When the Gypsies started singing you shouted. 'What voices! Just what we need!' - I said that? - You did. My god! What've I done! We must find Clementina at once, straighten things out and sign contract with her. - But where'll we find her? - I don't know. Today is the 14th, gentlemen. Your hoteI bill is due. Today's my birthday. - How old are you? - 52. - You don't say! - Cross my heart. I was born in the reign of Alexander 2, 13 years after the abolition of serfdom. You look great. Maybe, but my back aches. Happy birthday! May you be healthy, happy and famous! It's for you. - What's this? - A birthday present. With best wishes. It's nearly full. To keep your head warm. Nobody ever gave me any birthday presents before. The Jury - Is he a reaI Negro? - Yes. The purpose of this audition is to select a band to play in the City Garden. Any opinions? I want to ask them a question. What is the date of the Spartacus uprising? The uprising of slaves under the leadership of Spartacus took place in 73 B.C. I think they're suitable. What does ourjazz expert say? Where'd you get that tune? Kostya wrote it. You're probably the leader of this group, aren't you? Yes. Your newspaper denounces jazz all the time. We jazzmen don't like that. But now I think we ought to be gratefuI to you. This jazz craze is becoming an epidemic. Everybody under the sun is starting a jazz band. Midgets, housewives, Gypsies - they all have jazz bands. They're all clowns! If this landslide isn't stopped, it will bury reaI jazz. What were you doing before you took up jazz? I was a student in a music schooI. My advice is for you to go back to that schooI. You might turn into a competent pianist someday. You weren't meant forjazz. It isn't something just anybody can go in for. That's clear. Who's next? No use standing here. We got to do something. What do we do now? What's wrong? Don't take it to heart. Forget it. Relax - we'll show him! Let's have some tea and buns. Life is too short to get upset about everything that happens to you. Just imagine! What? An anarchist threw a bomb at the Governor of Pskov. - What're you raving about? - It's in the newspaper. But this paper's from 1904. Where'd you dig it up? Breakfast is ready. Come and have breakfast, Kostya. - I'm not hungry. - Have some hot potatoes. He's taking it hard. - We got to do something. - For example? I don't know. If somebody told him he was the king ofjazz... - I'll tell him. - Oh, shut up! Think you're Chamberlain? Telling everybody to shut up! If an authority on jazz told him that... Where can we find one? Remember that Leningrad man, he told us about who's the biggest expert on jazz? I don't remember. A captain in the Navy. Yes, and his name was connected somehow with meat. - Lambkin? - No. - Porkov? - No. - Venisonov? - No. It was Salamisky! That's right! If Salamisky told Kostya that he... But how can we get him here? Let's think it over. At last. - What about a uniform? - He'll get one. - How much does he want? - Three rubles. He looks like a rogue. A decent chap. A sea wolf! - Don't forget to limp. - As a war veteran. We'll go ahead, and you'll stay here in the woods. Later I'll call you. You come up and say: 'I'm Captain Salamisky. I've come here all the way from Leningrad to hear you'. I see. Then we play and when I give you a wink you say: 'That was wonderfuI! You're the King ofjazz! You'll be a great success!' Then I look at my watch and I say : 'It's 5.20' You say: 'I'll miss my boat!' and rush away. And that's the last we ever want to see of you. In that case it'll have be 5 rubles. - But we agreed on 3. - 5. - That's all we got. - We'll give you them tomorrow. - Then I'll come tomorrow. - Wait. Take some clothing instead. I'm a captain, not a junk dealer. I'll take it in gold. But we haven't any. What about fatso's gold tooth? You, rogue! How can you do this to me? Gimme the light. We came across a type in the woods just now, he would be hanging on us saying he's dying to hear our band play. I told we'd quit but he kept insisting. Who is he? A man from Leningrad. I think you know him. His name's Salamisky. Salamisky? Remember, you said he was the biggest jazz expert. A captain in the Navy. - Salaminov? - Yes, that's it. - Where is he? - Somewhere nearby. Should I call him? Come here, Captain. Meet Kostya Ivanov, the leader of our band. Eh. What, 'eh'? Captain Salaminov, from Leningrad. He's dying to hear our band. You're dying to hear us, aren't you? Say something, you dope! You're the dope! 'King of Jazz! WonderfuI!' Cheap con men! Cuts no ice with me. Stop! - Stop! - My gold tooth! ASSOCIATION OF PROLETARIAN MUSICIANS I'm so glad you came. Say, that's jazz! Remember this one? Of course. 'Rio Ruta'. I'm crazy about jazz. My wife left me on account of it. We've written an article against the Serapion Brothers. That can wait. These boys are a jazz band. WonderfuI! - Where're you playing? - Nowhere, at present. Give them quarters in the dormitory for proletarian musicians and issue them meaI tickets. Jazz is music for the rich. - Hear that? - What does he know! Living quarters and free meaI tickets. You'll play in the Transport Workers' Club. That's a big assignment. There're no debates here about jazz. Many faiI to see its revolutionary message. So be sure to play well. Think we'll be all right? Remember, I'm nearly 30, but what am I? You're a fine jazz musician. You mean it? Absolutely. And Ivan's a top-class saxophone player. Zhora's an ace drummer. There aren't many like you in the world. Of course! I'm a first class saxophone player. I'm super, you know. - What about me? - You're great! So is Zhora. And Kostya's one of the best in the world. Listen, guys. We're a reaI jazz band. Stepan! Zhora! Is that you? Who's that lovely lady? - Don't you recognize me? - Katya? Hi. You look like a million! I can't complain. Married a rich man, or what? They're all at my feet. I'm a star now. Isabelle Fox! All that I ever dreamed of Happened to lucky me. Hear how my heart is beating In time with this melody! Life brings me joys far sweeter Than the most sweet of dreams. Hear how my heart is beating? I'm in love, it seems. Thank you, music, thank you; You're full of tenderness and strength. Thank you for this bright moment When a whole new world opened up to me - Your world, o music! I'm enchanted by your singing! Let's celebrate the occasion with champagne! Nice idea. Champagne. How are you getting along? - We're doing fine. - Still doing those jingles? We play jazz nowadays. You play jazz? - What's so funny? - You play jazz? - Stepan's a band leader? - No, Kostya's the leader. Your Kostya is a demonic character. Really? - A strong, silent man. - What do you mean silent? Fallen in love with me? Nothing of the kind. I like you. Why don't you invite me to dance with you? My old piano is in a fright, It can't get the blues quite right; These new melodies are okay, but it'd rather play Bach all day. Believe me, old piano mine, This's no time to whine! New rhythms have long replaced the old, Don't let them leave you cold. It's hard to get used to jazz, I know, but don't feeI low. I'm sorry for you, old piano mine, but you mustn't whine! When my hands touch your ancient keys, From every heart sorrow flees. My old, tired piano shares Both my happiness and my cares. - Are you really a jazz band? - Yeah. You don't look it. People'II laugh when you start to play. - But why? - It beats me. Stepan, Zhora, and that fatso - call that a jazz band? That fatso is a great saxophone player. A jazz band! Yep. We'll work out a reaI jazz program. Not with them you won't. But why? You need better musicians for that. But I tell you they're fine musicians. Let's begin together. I'll be the singer, and I'll find the musicians. - But we four began together. - So what? Everybody began one way or another. I'll stay with them. Too bad! Well, I'll be going. So long. OUR FIRST CONCERT OF PROLETARIAN JAZZ 'Captain Salaminov, Baltic Fleet, Leningrad. 'We invite you to Moscow on November 18 'to hear ourjazz band'. We need a good meaI before this evening's show. Come and hear us tonight. Where's the food? The Secretariat of the Union of Proletarian Musicians gave orders not to feed jazz band because you're - agents of bourgeois culture. - What did you say? - Agents? Who, us? - Yes, you! There! Don't you read the papers? 'To nip this beerhall fad in the bud, 'to continue along the road of revolutionary quests, 'we shout loud and clear: 'Down with jazz bands!' Now vacate this table. Hello, boys. As you see, things took an unfortunate turn. What does a newspaper article matter, after all? They went too far, so what? It'll all straighten out. Jazz will come into it's own. No doubt about it. Well, let's be going. Excuse me. Am I late? My name's Salaminov. Are you the ones who invited me to a concert?
